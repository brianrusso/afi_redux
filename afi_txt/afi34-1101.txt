Introduction.  The Air Force Recovery Coordination Program (RCP) encompasses all non-medical support to seriously wounded, ill and injured Airmen and their families.  This includes all Air Force policy and program development efforts initiated out of the Air Force Warrior and Survivor  Care  Branch  (AF/A1SAZ)  as  well  as  all  operational  programs  managed  by  the  Air Force  Personnel  Center  Warrior  and  Survivor  Care  Division  (AFPC/DPFW).      This  instruction applies to Regular Air Force (RegAF), Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve (AFR) Airmen  who  are  seriously  wounded,  ill  and  injured  regardless  of  the  cause.    Throughout  this instruction,  the  term  Airman  applies  to  any  Air  Force  member  regardless  of  component affiliation.  All RCP assets will be made available to Airmen in need and their families without regard to current status or line of duty determination. 1.2.  Philosophy.  The Air Force has numerous resources to draw upon to assist Air Force team members  who  are  seriously  wounded,  ill  or  injured.    The  Air  Force  team  includes  active  duty, reserve,  guard,  government  contractors,  and  civilian  federal  employees.    All  members  of  this team should be rendered the maximum level of assistance permitted by law. 1.2.1.  Under this instruction, the guiding principles of all services and support to families are timeliness, relevance, and compassion.  “Timeliness” means the immediate consideration for enrollment into the RCP and/or support for families, efficient  information transmission and promptness  in  the  delivery  of  services  and  response  to  inquiries.    “Relevance”  means tailoring both information and services to the needs and expressed desires of the Airman or family members.  “Compassion” means responding with empathy to the best of one’s ability, just as those providing information and services would wish their own families to be treated. 1.2.2.  This  instruction  also  acknowledges  the  possibility  that  Air  Force  members  and  their families,  who  would  not  otherwise  qualify  for  assistance  under  this  program,  may  seek  the help  of  our  Recovery  Care  Coordinators  (RCCs)  and  our  Non-Medical  Care  Managers (NMCMs).  To the maximum extent possible, while not distracting from the primary mission, our RCCs and NMCMs are allowed and encouraged to provide situational support on a non-recurring basis.  Should the Airman or their family require frequent  assistance, the RCC or NMCM  should  either  refer  them  into  the  RCP  or  refer  them  to  another  appropriate organization/program to provide continuing support. 1.3.  Procedural Guidance: 1.3.1.  This instruction is the source document for Air Force policies and programs regarding non-medical  support  to  wounded,  ill  and  injured  Airmen  and  their  families.  It  focuses  on information flow to families and the integration and harmonization of benefits and assistance. Lastly,  it  provides  an  overview  of  services  and  support  that  should  be  offered  to  seriously wounded, ill and injured Airmen. 1.3.2.  This instruction is not intended to replace guidance regarding individual entitlements, benefits and services contained in function-specific directives.  Commanders and other users of  this  instruction  are  expected  to  use  this  instruction,  other  source  documents  and  contact with functional experts to gain a working understanding of the range of services available to them to help those in need.  This instruction is designed to help commanders anticipate and   6  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 plan  to  assist  a  broad  range  of  Airmen  who  could  require  post-injury/illness  support,  or specific  benefits  and  entitlements  and  assistance  to  wounded,  ill  and  injured  personnel  and their families 1.3.3.  Air Force organizations and functional managers responsible for processes which are integral to the objectives of the Air Force RCP will coordinate with AF/A1SAZ to ensure this instruction  provides  current  detailed  guidance  and  maintains  policy  in  related  directives which complement this  instruction.  These processes include wounded, ill  and injured care, casualty  reporting,  Integrated  Disability  Evaluation  System  (IDES),  and  transition  support.  AF/A1SAZ will ensure this instruction is kept current through regular consultation with the interacting functions. 1.3.4.  Use  of  the  procedures  and  assistance  strategy  described  in  this  instruction  does  not constitute  an  admission  of  legal  liability  for  any  fatalities,  personal  injuries,  or  property losses that may have been experienced in conjunction with Air Force operations.  Use of the procedures  and  support  processes  described  in  this  instruction  is  solely  intended  to  assure timely, appropriate, and  compassionate humanitarian assistance  within the limits  of Federal law.    Therefore,  just  as  it  is  essential  to  be  timely,  focused,  and  compassionate  in  their dealings  with  those  impacted  by  circumstances  covered  by  this  policy,  it  is  crucial  for  Air Force  personnel  to  keep  promises  made  to  Airmen,  their  families,  Next-of-Kin  (NOK)  and others, but also to avoid making any promises which are beyond the limits of Federal  Law, Air Force policies and guidelines, and beyond the scope of the specific responsibilities of the roles discussed in this instruction. 1.4.  Persons Eligible to Receive Information and Assistance under this Instruction.  All of the persons described in  this paragraph are entitled to effective and caring communication, and all  will  be  provided  information  to  the  maximum  extent  permitted  by  law.    Information  on wounded, ill and injured Airmen should only be shared if approval is received from the member.  In the case where a member is incapacitated and cannot give consent to release of information, consult the local Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) regarding release of such information. 1.4.1.  Next-of-Kin (NOK):  “NOK” is the term  used to describe the sole person who has a specific,  legally  defined  relationship  with  another  person  who  has  become  a  casualty,  i.e., died or been injured.  For the purposes of this instruction, unless an individual is specifically identified by the AIRMAN to be notified in an emergency (i.e., on the vRED- virtual Record of  Emergency  Data  Form),  the  next-of  kin  will  be  presumed  to  be  the  person  most  closely related to the victim: the parents(s) of a single person without children, a spouse, or children of a single parent. 1.4.2.  Family Members:  A working definition of persons who should be considered “family members” is essential to the effectiveness of the processes described in this instruction.  This instruction embodies a broader definition of the concept of family than is found in other Air Force publications because it is designed to serve the needs of the entire spectrum of persons who  have  experienced  a  traumatic  event(s).    Therefore,  for  the  purpose  of  this  instruction, “family” is defined as NOK and the individuals identified by the Airman to be notified in an emergency  and  those  identified  by  the  Airman  as  family.    In  some  instances,  benefit entitlements,  sharing  of  sensitive  information  regarding  health  care  and  access  to  other information  may  be  withheld  from  some  identified  here  as  family  members  due  to  Federal law which specifies who may be allowed access.  In all instances, the Airman is at liberty to AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   7  inform  any  individual  of  their  medical  situation  and  treatment  options  as  well  as  benefit entitlement  and  receipt  and  have  anyone  they  wish  present  in  any  meetings  regarding  their care. 1.4.3.  Civilians:    The  RCP  will  provide  support  to  government  civilian  employees  that  are injured  during  a  deployment  supporting  combat  forces.    The  support  will  be  the  same  as provided to active and reserve component military until such time as the civilian employee is returned  to  their  home  installation  and  come  under  the  care  of  the  local  civilian  personnel office and their local treatment facility and/or civilian doctor. 1.4.3.1.  The  RCP  will  provide  support  to  contractor  personnel  injured  during  a deployment to a designated theater of operations supporting combat forces.  The support will  be  the  amount  necessary  to  return  the  contract  personnel  to  the  States  or  their overseas  normal  work  location  at  which  time  the  contract  company  must  assume  the responsibility of care for their employees.  The RCP will not provide support for making doctor’s appointments or other medical procedures covered by the employee’s company provided insurance. 1.4.4.  Other Individuals:  Given the wide range of personal relationships, a commander may recognize  a  greater  number  of  individuals  in  providing  desired  information,  support  or services.    Examples  of  such  individuals  may  include  fiancées,  step  parents,  foster  parents, former spouses, etc.  Commanders should approach each situation of this type sensitively, but only  in  close  consultation  with  their  Staff  Judge  Advocate  (SJA),  and  ensure  that  in  such cases, first priority is given to NOK and family members. 1.5.  Receipt  of  Gifts/Ethics.  Airmen  wounded  during  combat  operations,  injured  in  non-combat  activities  or  suffering  from  serious  illnesses  face  unique  and  difficult  challenges, including  navigation  of  various  benefits  and  compensation  systems,  reintegration  into  family units,  lifestyle  changes  brought  upon  them  by  their  injuries,  and  possible  return  to  civilian workforce as a disabled veteran.  Many charities, Veterans service organizations, and other non-profit  organizations  exist  that  provide  support  and  services  to  these  Airmen  in  many  forms. Although  the  Air  Force  cannot  endorse  any  particular  non-Federal  entity,  RCP  personnel  can facilitate  access  between  the  organizations  and  wounded,  ill  and  injured  Airmen  and  their families, when authorized to do so by the latter.  AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force, provides guidance, when it is appropriate for such gifts to be made to the Air Force for distribution  to  individuals.    DoD  5500.07-R,  Joint  Ethics  Regulation,  governs  when  combat-wounded,  ill  and  injured  Airmen  and  their  families  may  accept  such  gifts  in  their  personal capacities. 1.5.1.  Who may receive gifts from non-profits; Airmen who incurred an illness or injury as a result of armed conflict; while engaged in hazardous service; in training for war; through an instrumentality of war; in a combat or similar area recognized by law or regulation. 1.5.2.  What  may  be  accepted.    Gifts  with  a  market  value  of  $375  per  gift  on  occasion  and $1000  in  gifts  total  from  a  single  donor  may  be  accepted  without  prior  approval.    Gifts beyond these totals  require a written ethics determination that may be obtained through the local  legal  office.    Receipt  of  items,  monetary  gifts,  or  specialty  services  provided  by  a government sanctioned agency or program, are by design approved for acceptance and do not require an ethics determination and do not have a monetary limit unless established as part of the agency or program offering the service or gift.   8  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 1.5.3.  When there is any question as to whether a gift is appropriate or not, the local Judge Advocate should be consulted. AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   9  Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES (KEY PERSONNEL IN THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES) 2.1.  Air  Force Warrior and Survivor Care.  This program encompasses all support provided to  seriously  ill  and  injured  Airmen  and  their  families.    Air  Force  Warrior  and  Survivor  Care provides policy and oversight for the RCP. 2.2.  The  Chain  of  Command  of  the  ill,  or  injured.  Military  operations  carry  inherent  risks.  Commanders have an ongoing obligation to ensure the members under their command are aware of those risks and manage them responsibly.  In turn, members may desire to keep their families aware of the nature of their duties and the hazards they entail.  Support to ill or injured Airmen and their families is an inherent obligation of command.  By extension, if persons from outside the unit, including civilians, suffer wounds, illness or injury as a result of Air Force operations, the chain of command of the unit most closely associated with the event must ensure support and assistance are rendered to the maximum extent allowable by law.  Wing/installation commanders attempting  to  fulfill  such  obligations  will  be  supported  by  their  parent  major  command (MAJCOM).    Should  Air  Force-level  assistance  be  required  (for  logistics,  funding,  etc),  Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care will work with the entire chain of command to help execute the provisions of this instruction as fully as possible.  Specific responsibilities are as follows: 2.2.1.  MAJCOM Commanders.  MAJCOM Commanders must ensure timely, effective care and support for the ill and injured within their MAJCOM. (T-2) 2.2.2.  Wing/Installation  Commanders.    Wing/Installation  Commanders  must  ensure  base-wide  programs  in  the  military  treatment  facilities/clinics,  personnel  services,  chaplain services, Airman and Family Readiness Centers (A&FRCs), and other base organizations, are unified  in  their  support  and  priority  of  care  for  the  ill  and  injured.    Commanders  should ensure these programs work closely with the RCCs and Air Force NMCMs.  (T-2) 2.2.3.  Unit  Commanders.    Unit  commanders  represent  the  first  line  of  communication  for families  to  ensure  their  needs  are  addressed  as  completely  as  law,  directives,  and  customs allow.  Unit Commanders, First Sergeants and supervisors have a duty and responsibility to care for the members of their unit and their families.  The provisions in this instruction exist to add another set of tools to help the commander and the unit care for their Airmen. 2.3.  The Recovery Care Program (RCP).  The RCP is executed out of the Air Force Personnel Center  (AFPC).    The  RCP  provides  concentrated  services  to  Airmen  who  sustain  a  serious combat  or  non-combat  related  injury  or  illness  requiring  long-term  care  that  may  require  an Initial  Review  In-Lieu-Of  (IRILO),  Medical  or  Physical  Evaluation  Board  (MEB  or  PEB)  to determine fitness for duty. 2.3.1.  Wounded Ill/Injured Cell (WII Cell).   The WII Cell coordinates assignment of Care Management  Team  (CMT)  members  to  all  seriously  injured  (SI)  or  very  seriously  injured (VSI) Airmen, to include those who have sustained an illness or injury due to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and/or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) regardless of the severity of the injury.   10  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 2.3.2.  Recovery  Care  Coordinator  (RCC).    The  RCC  has  the  primary  responsibility  for  the Integrated Comprehensive Plan (ICP) and serves as the Lead Coordinator (LC) as soon as the Airman  transitions  to  outpatient  status.  The  WII  Cell  assigns  an  RCC  to  all  seriously  and very seriously ill/injured Airmen.  RCCs serve  as the focal  point for ill  and injured service members,  veterans  and the  development  and  delivery  of services/resources  through  the  ICP  in  coordination  with  other  Care  Management  Team (CMT) members ensuring quality care and accountability. to  oversee families 2.3.3.  Non-Medical Care Manager (NMCM).  The NMCMs are part of the CMT and support the RCCs in the field during the phases of care that encompass recovery and rehabilitation.  Once  the  Airman  enters  the  Integrated  Disability  Evaluation  System  (IDES)  process,  the RCC transfers the role of LC to the NMCM, but continues to provide assistance as necessary, for  the  duration  of  care  until  the  Airman  transitions  to  the  Department  of  Veteran  Affairs (VA)  for  support  after  service.    The  NMCM  provides  assistance  with  all  benefits/ entitlements for those remaining on active duty or transitioning back into the civilian sector and help resolve problems related to finances, benefits and compensation, administrative and personnel paperwork, housing and transportation and other matters that arise. 2.3.4.  Family Liaison Officer (FLO).  The FLO is an individual appointed to assist seriously ill and injured Airmen and their families.  FLOs are responsible for logistical support to the Airman and his or her family, such as meeting family members at the airport and arranging lodging and transportation.  FLOs also serve as a “facilitator” by assisting the Airman and his or her family navigates through the various agencies involved in recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration. 2.3.4.1.  WII Cell will contact unit commanders when Emergency Family Member Travel (EFMT) is requested for Active Duty Airmen who are identified by a medical authority as  VSI  or  SI  for  the  assignment  of  a  FLO.    Unit  commanders  are  responsible  for determining whether or not the assignment of a FLO is required. 2.3.4.1.1.  NGB/A1S Warrior and Survivor Care will designate a FLO for any ANG member identified by a medical authority as VSI or SI. 2.3.4.2.  WII  Cell  provides  training  and  guidance  to  the  FLO  and  identifies  them  to  the CMT when tasking out the referral. 2.3.4.2.1.  When an ANG unit is notified of a member in a VSI or SI category through the  Casualty  Reporting  System.    The  FSS/CC  will  coordinate  with  NGB/A1S  to determine  FLO  assignment  selection  and  provide  Just-in-Time  face  to  face  FLO training at the local level.  NGB/A1S will forward FLO information to the WII Cell. 2.3.4.2.2.  Once FLO training is complete, the Base Services Manager will forward a copy of the FLO appointment letter signed by the Wing CC to NGB/A1S.  NGB/A1S will  ray  necessary  information  along  with  the  FLO  contact  information  to  the  WII Cell. 2.3.4.3.  FLO will be tasked whenever combat related injury is MEDEVAC to CONUS; does not have to be VSI or SI. 2.3.5.  Recovering  Airman  Mentorship  Program  (RAMP)  Manager.    The  RAMP  Manager has oversight and is responsible for overseeing all facets of the Air Force Wounded Warrior AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   11  Mentorship  Program  known  as  RAMP.  This  includes  training,  and  ensuring  mentors  are assigned to those seriously ill/injured or very seriously ill/injured Airmen that could benefit from  the program.   These mentors are Wounded Warriors that serve as the wingmen for ill and injured Airmen to help navigate them through the recovery process. 2.3.6.  Outreach,  Communications  and  Marketing  Coordinator  (OCMC).    The  OCMC  will advance  social  media  to  the  greatest  extent  possible  to  provide  specific  care  management, education,  training  and  support  to  our  ill  and  injured  Airmen  and  their  families/caregivers along with informing Air Force-wide audiences of Wounded Warrior programs and support opportunities.  Additionally, they will create and maintain both a .mil and a .com website in accordance with (IAW) the policies in AFI 33-129, Web Management and Internet Use, and provide  audience  appropriate  material  on  each  ensuring  public  access  to  the  programs  that support our ill and injured Airmen and their families/caregivers. 2.3.7.  Caregiver  Program  Manager:  Provides  oversight  and  facilitates  caregiver  support mandated by DoD.  Coordinates with Regional Peer Support Coordinators (PSCs), Military Family  Life  Counselors  (MFLCs),  RCCs,  and  Airman  and  Family  Readiness  Centers  to ensure  caregiver  forums  are  being  held  on  a  routine  basis.    Distributes  additional  caregiver information regarding virtual forums and webinars for widest dissemination. Coordinates and connects caregivers to resources and services as needed. 2.3.8.  The  Airman  and  Family  Readiness  Center  (A&FRC).    AFI  36-3009,  Airman  & Family  Readiness  Centers,  provides  policy  for  A&FRC  Program’s  mission  and responsibilities.  A&FRCs are a key partner in  providing a wide range of support to ill and injured Airmen, their families and caregivers.  A&FRC staff represent consistent sources of corporate knowledge of installation and local communities; a crucial resource for FLOs.  The A&FRC  Community  Readiness  Consultant  (CRC)  may  serve  as  the  local  point  of  contact and  face  of  the  AFW2  program  when  the  RCC  is  unavailable  and  the  Airman  or  family requires direct assistance. 2.3.8.1.  The  Airman  and  Family  Readiness  Program  Manager  (A&FRPM).    The A&FRPM is tasked with assisting leadership with those Airmen who have been identified as Wounded,  Ill or  Injured.  The A&FRPM must rely on active duty (AD) resources to support Airmen identified in these categories due to the demand of care.  A&FRPMs are staffed  as  a  1-deep  position,  tasked  with  all  the  day-to-day  actions  of  an  AD  A&FRC.  The  AFRPM  provides  Transition/Pre-Separation  counseling  as  needed,  plus  ongoing information and referral  support to identified community resources in coordination with the RCC. 2.3.9.  Military  Chaplains  and  Chaplain  Assistants.    Responsibilities  of  chaplains  and chaplain  assistants  as  they  relate  to  Warrior  and  Survivor  Care  are  covered  in  AFI  52-101, Planning  and  Organizing,  and  AFI  52-104,  Chaplain  Service  Readiness.    Chaplains  are instrumental in the support of other agencies care to ill and injured Airmen and their families, such as death notification. 2.4.  Other Service Providers.  No single agency can meet the complex needs of families when an Airman becomes ill or injured.  However, such situations can be anticipated and provided for in  advance  if  partnerships  and  formal  relationships  with  potential  supplemental  sources  of support are forged  before  a crisis  develops.   Various  sources of augmentation, information  and   12  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 outreach  are  available  to  aid  affected  families,  communities  and  others  who  potentially  may require information and assistance beyond the resources of the Air Force. 2.4.1.  Where statutory relationships  and responsibilities for support and information  do not exist,  HQ  USAF,  MAJCOMs,  and  local  commanders  and  A&FRC  advisors  are  to  develop appropriate contacts and formal relationships as necessary to arrange, validate, and exercise these capabilities.  (National, private or quasi-official organizations will only be contacted by HQ  USAF  for  this  purpose.)    However,  all  such  agreements  must  include  specific  service tracking and accounting procedures, along with detailed reimbursement plans.  Examples of such agencies include: 2.4.1.1.  The Air Force Aid Society (AFAS).  The AFAS is the official charity of the Air Force.  AFAS activities are managed at base level by the A&FRC, and it works closely with the American Red Cross. 2.4.1.2.  The  Air  Force  Association  (AFA)  and  America’s  Fund:    The  Air  Force  has  a memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  with  each  of  these  non-profit  organizations  to provide  a  blanket  ethics  determination  for  gifts  they  may  provide  to  certain  combat-wounded, ill and injured Airmen and their families.   Recent  years  have  seen  the  growth  of  private 2.4.1.3.  Private  Organizations. organizations.  All are geared toward providing or locating a variety of support resources and  programs.    While  the  Department  of  the  Air  Force  may  not  endorse  organizations which are not specifically provided for by statute (such as the Air Force Assistance Fund and  its  four  subordinate  Service  charities),  the  RCP,  along  with  commanders,  will facilitate any family requests to be put in contact with such organizations. AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   13  Chapter 3 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 3.1.  Program Description:  The Air Force RCP is designed to marshal all available resources in support of family needs when an Airman becomes seriously ill or injured.  At the same time, the RCP  also  provides  systematic  structure  through  which  offers  of  assistance,  information  and support  are  made  available  on  the  family’s  terms.    Families  have  different  needs,  so  each  case must be considered and handled on an individual basis. 3.2.  Foundations of Care, Management and Transition Support 3.2.1.  Every injured or ill Airman routinely receives medical and psychosocial screening and the  appropriate  treatment.  Those  who  are  categorized  as  being  seriously  ill  or  injured, including those who have been medically evacuated from the theater, will be referred to the RCP. 3.2.2.  The medical input on the seriousness of the injury or illness will be used to determine which  care  category  the  injured  or  ill  service  member  is  assigned  to.  The  DoD  uses  three general care categories: Category 1 (CAT 1), Category 2 (CAT 2) or Category 3 (CAT 3). 3.2.2.1.  CAT 1 Airman: Has a mild injury or illness, is expected to return to duty in less than  180  days,  and  receives  primarily  local  outpatient  and  short-term  inpatient  medical treatment and rehabilitation.  Unless their medical/psychological condition worsens, they will not  be enrolled to  the RCP.  They will, however, be provided assistance on  a non-recurring basis if they request it. 3.2.2.2.  CAT  2  Airman:  Has  a  serious  injury  or  illness,  is  unlikely  to  return  to  duty  in less than 180 days, and may be medically separated from the military. 3.2.2.2.1.  Airmen  designated  CAT  2  and  referred  to  the  RCP  will  be  assessed  and enrolled  by  the  WII  Cell  as  needed.  Once  enrolled  in  the  program  and  dependent upon  the  phase  of  care,  the  RCC  or  NMCM  will  oversee  the  development  and implementation  of  an  Integrated  Comprehensive  Plan  (ICP).    The  plan  will  be implemented  by  the  direct  services  of  a  Case  Management  Team  (CMT)  of  health care providers, RCCs, NMCMs, A&FRC personnel, and advocates. 3.2.2.2.2.  RCC and/or the NMCM will prepare  the CAT 2 Airmen who  are leaving the  military  for  their  transition  to  veteran  status  with  an  introduction  and  provide handoff  of  the  lead  coordinator  responsibility  to  the  VA  at  receipt  of  the  DD-214, Certificate  of  Release  or  Discharge  from  Active  Duty  in  accordance  with  the  intent for  handoffs  as  described  in  the  Memorandum  Of  Understanding  (MOU)  Between Department  Of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  and  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)for Interagency  Complex  Care  Coordination  Requirements  for  Service  Members  and Veterans,and  referrals  to  community-based  partners  as  appropriate.    Oversight  and assistance after medical  separation or retirement will continue to be provided for up to  12  months  by  the  RCC/NMCM  or  until  the  RCP  determines  AF  services  are  no longer  required  by  the  Airman  and/or  family  members,  whichever  comes  first.  During this 12 month period, the VA will maintain the lead on the case as outlined in   14  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 the MOU referenced above with the RCC/NMCM ensuring all efforts are coordinated with the VA lead. 3.2.2.2.3.  Airmen  who  are  seriously  injured  or  ill  (CAT  2)  and  are  enrolled  in  the RCP  will  be  assigned  an  RCC  who  provides  oversight  and  assistance  for  care, management  and  transition.  RCCs  serve  as  independent  advocates  for  the  Airmen, responsible  for  providing  oversight  of  the  development  and  implementation  of  the personalized ICP. They are assigned regions throughout the Continental United States (CONUS) and Overseas (OCONUS) and perform their duties under the oversight of AFPC/DPFW Warrior and Survivor Care Division Chief. 3.2.2.3.  CAT 3 Airman:  Has a severe/catastrophic injury or illness, is highly unlikely to return to duty, and will most likely be medically separated from the military. 3.2.2.3.1.  Airmen  designated  as  CAT  3  will  be  referred  to  the  DOD/VA  Federal Recovery  Care  Program  (FRCP)  by  the  WII  Cell,  the  RCC  or  the  NMCM  at  the appropriate  time.  Once  assessed  and  enrolled  in  the  program,  a  Federal  Recovery Coordinator  (FRC)  will  collaborate  in  the  development  and  implementation  of  their ICP.  Elements of the Plan will be executed by a CMT of health care providers, RCCs and  NMCMs,  Airman  &  Family  Readiness  personnel  and  advocates  in  partnership with the FRC. 3.2.2.3.2.  Federal  Recovery  Coordinator  (FRC):    Severely  injured  or  ill  service members (CAT 3) who are enrolled in the FRCP will be referred to a VA-employed FRC  who  will  provide  oversight  and  assistance  for  the  care,  management  and transition of Airmen on active duty and when they transition to veteran status. They, in partnership with the RCC and the NMCM oversee the development and execution of  the  personalized  ICP  and  help  eliminate  barriers  to  the  services  and  resources identified in the plan. 3.2.3.  Seriously and severely injured or ill Airmen are supported by primary care managers (PCMs), nurses and personnel in the Air Force RCP (RCCs and NMCMs). They come from many  disciplines  and  programs;  together  they  coordinate  all  non-medical  care  needs  and assistance  and  make  up  the  CMT  that  provides  direct  care  and  services  through  the  Seven Phases of the Continuum of Care. 3.2.3.1.1.  The  Seven  Phases  of  the  Continuum  of  Care.      The  Seven  Phases  of  the Continuum  of  Care  consists  of  the  following  phases:    Identification,  Recovery, Rehabilitation, Fitness Evaluation, Reintegration/Transition, Stabilization/Resolution, and finally Sustainment. Navigation through these phases of care ensures specialized and comprehensive medical and non-medical care and assistance to Airmen.   These phases  of  care,  although  designed  in  a  linear  fashion,  do  not  always  proceed  in  that way  for  all  Airmen.    In  some  instances,  an  Airman  may  move  from  Recovery  to Rehabilitation several times based on medical procedures and complications. 3.2.3.2.  An RCC and an NMCM will be assigned to each enrolled Airman in the RCP to oversee the development of the  ICP and its implementation  through the  coordination of the delivery of direct services by the appropriate CMT members. 3.2.3.3.  Medical  Case  Manager  (MCM):    MCMs,  nurses  or  social  workers,  ensure  that the  Airman  and  family  understand  and  have  timely  access  to  recommended  treatment. AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   15  They  make  sure  quality  medical  and  behavioral  health  care  is  provided  during  lengthy inpatient  treatments  at  military  treatment  facilities  or  medical  centers,  or  during outpatient treatment for medical or behavioral health services. 3.2.3.4.  Care  Management  Team  (CMT).    All  CMTs  shall  include  the  Airman’s Commander, Airman; an RCC and/or an FRC; an MCM; and an NMCM. They may also include  medical  professionals  such  as  PCMs,  mental  health  providers,  physical  and occupational  therapists  (PT/OT),  and  others  such  as  Physical  Evaluation  Board  Liaison Officers  (PEBLOs),  Veteran  Affairs  (VA)  Military  Services  Coordinators  (MSC), chaplains, and family support program representatives.  Except in major medical facilities the  members  of  the  CMT  are  not  likely  to  be  collocated.    Coordination  among  the members  will  often  be  virtual  (telephone,  email,  and  teleconference).    The  CMT members  will  regularly  discuss  the  status  of  their  activities  with  each  other  as  they support  the  implementation  of  the  Airman’s  ICP.  This  continuous  exchange  of information ensures accountability across providers and eliminates gaps or redundancy in medical and non-medical care support. 3.2.4.  The maximum number of Airmen in CAT 2 and CAT 3 that the RCCs and NMCMs may support will not exceed 40 cases for any RCC or NMCM. While averages for the total number  of  RCCs  and/or  NMCMs  may  be  less  than  40  cases,  every  effort  must  be  made  to maintain caseloads for each at no more than 40. The actual number of cases assigned to each RCC and NMCM will be closely monitored and reviewed as part of the overall evaluation of the  program  with  modifications  made  and  published  as  needed.  Any  departure  from  the maximum number established in this policy will require a waiver by the Secretary of the Air Force.  Waiver requests will be submitted to AF/A1SAZ for concurrence and staffing.  Every effort  must be made during the waiver  application process  to  rectify the  overload situation.  Caseload waivers will not exceed 120 days. (T-3) 3.2.5.  The  uniform  basic  training  curriculum  for  RCCs  and  NMCMs  is  developed  and aligned  using  DoD/VA  learning  objectives  and  instructional  content  created  by  the  DoD Office of Warrior Care Policy.  This curriculum will ensure all RCCs and NMCMs receive common  content  and  instruction  according  to  their  roles  and  responsibilities.  It  will  also incorporate  relevant  content  from  professional  development  and  degree  granting  programs and the Case Management Society of America, among others. 3.2.6.  Conducting  a  comprehensive  needs  assessment  for  Airmen  provides  a  systematic, ongoing  process  of  collecting  comprehensive  information  about  a  beneficiary’s  situation  to identify  individual  needs.    It  will  be  used  to  identify  needs  in  key  areas  of  the  lives  of enrolled  Airmen  and  their  families.  Information  from  the  assessment  will  help  the  CMT develop an ICP with the Airman and family. 3.2.7.  Information  collected  from  the  comprehensive  needs  assessment  will  be  used  to develop an ICP for those Airmen enrolled in the RCP. The plan will identify the personal and professional  goals  of  the  Airman  and  the  services  and  resources  needed  to  meet  them.  The members  of  the  CMT,  who  will  provide  the  relevant  service  and  resources,  including  the community-based partners, will also be identified in the plan. 3.2.8.  The CMT will ensure that the needs of families are identified and addressed across all phases  of  care  by  connecting  the  family  to  the  multitude  of  governmental  and  non-governmental services and resources that offer support.   16  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 3.2.8.1.  Families play a critical role in the ability of injured or ill Airmen or veterans to move  from  “survive”  to  “thrive”.    Families  are  spouses  and  children,  but  they  are  also parents,  siblings,  fiancés,  and  other  relatives  or  close  friends  who  assume  the  role  of designated caregiver to the Airman.  Family members encounter many challenges when assuming  this  role  including:  job  absences;  lost  income;  travel  and  relocation  costs; temporary  housing  arrangements;  and  emotional  and  psychological  stress.    This  “cost” for care will be tracked and assistance provided by the RCC/NMCM through a variety of programs and non-profit support available to the Airman and their caregiver. 3.2.8.2.  Information tracked and collected is provided by the families voluntarily and is kept  as  notes  in  the  DoD  Case  Management  System  case  file.    The  DoD-CMS  is approved for collection of PII information and is included in the Federal  Registry.  The information is protected through controlled access and further protected within roles and only  the  case  manager  and  supervisor  can  see  the  information.    No  information  is provided  to  any  outside  entity,  including  charities,  non-profits,  or  other  government agencies  without  approval.    Should  the  family  need  assistance  from  an  outside  agency, the  case  manager  will  contact  the  agency  to  ensure  they  provide  the  service  and  get contact  information  which  is  shared  with  the  Airman  and  family  so  they  may  choose  if they wish to make contact.  No personal or contact information is provided to the outside agency. 3.2.9.  IDES with its MEBs and PEBs is a key step in the care, management and transition of the  Airman.    IDES  ensures  our  ill  or  injured  Airmen,  Veterans  and  their  family  member(s) receive quality, fair, and just care and benefits through a joint program between the DoD and VA.    The  IDES  seeks  to  ensure  seamless  service  delivery  by  eliminating  duplicate,  time-consuming, and overlapping elements of the military disability evaluation and VA disability benefits  processes.    The  IDES  process  is  outlined  in  AFI  36-3212,  Physical  Evaluation  for Retention, Retirement, and Separation. 3.2.9.1.  One  of  the  goals  of  the  IDES  is  to  ensure  each  Airman’s  case  is  properly documented,  fairly  presented,  and  fully  considered  by  all  elements  of  the  disability evaluation  system.    Medical  and  disability  evaluation  through  the  MEB  and  PEB processes could be one of the most significant events in the life of an Air Force member who  incurs  a  disabling  injury  or  illness.    The  Air  Force  MEB  or  PEB  will  determine whether an Airman may continue to serve. The Board evaluates an Airman’s fitness for duty and will make one  of the following determinations: fit for duty, unfit  for duty and Limited  Assignment  Status  (LAS),  unfit  for  duty  and  separation,  or  unfit  for  duty  and retirement.  When a service member is found fit, he or she returns to duty and continues to  serve  the  Air  Force.  A  service  member  may  be  found  unfit  for  duty  and  separate  or retire from the military, depending on the extent of the injury and/or length of time in the service.  In  addition,  an  active  duty  service  member  may  be  found  unfit  for  duty  and continued on LAS. 3.2.9.1.1.  The Physical Evaluation Board Liaison Officer (PEBLO) and VA Military Service Coordinator (MSC) provide the Airman and  family  with  information on the process and benefits.  They handle the case file throughout the IDES process and help coordinate medical appointments. They know the Airman’s unique issues and works closely  across  the  DoD  and  VA  with  the  multiple  health  care  professionals,  care managers, patient administration personnel, the Command and the CMT. AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   17  3.2.10.  The  importance  of  processing  those  Airmen  who  are  projected  to  separate  in  a thorough, accurate, dignified and timely manner cannot be overemphasized.  Airmen who are found unfit for duty and are separating/retiring, receive pre-separation transition  counseling with  their  families  on  such  key  issues  as  benefits,  employment,  education,  healthcare  and relocation.    Separating/retiring  Airmen  receive  post-transition  counseling  and  lifelong assistance from the VA once their DD-214 Form, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty is received. 3.2.11.  Transition  support  is  needed  by  Airmen  and  families  before,  during  and  after relocation  from  one  treatment  or  rehabilitation  location  to  another  or  to  community  living.  Preparations are made for transitions with sufficient advance notice and information so that upcoming changes across locations of care or caregivers are anticipated and arrangements are made for needed services and resources. 3.2.11.1.  Based  on  the  Physical  Evaluation  Board  (PEB)  outcome  the  Airman’s  ICP  is revised to reflect the medical and non-medical services and resources needed to meet new personal  and  professional  goals  such  as  employment,  education  and  vocational  training and  the  rehabilitation  necessary  to  meet  those  goals.  Options  will  be  identified  by  the CMT  with  sufficient  time  for  acquiring  services  and  resources  such  as  financial  aid, housing  adaptation,  assistive  technology,  employer  support,  and  college  or  vocational assistance. Introductions will be made to new CMT members or care partners if changes are made based on the new goals. 3.2.12.  CMT  members  will  continue  to  regularly  review  the  services  and  resources  needed by Airmen and their families as their conditions and needs change.  For example, the RCCs and  NMCMs  will  ensure  that  their  transitioning  Airmen  are  connected  to  the  VA  or TRICARE  before  their  medical  separation  or  retirement  occurs  so  they  can  receive  the services and resources needed.  They will continue to review the Airman’s experience during transition  to  ensure  a  successful  reintegration  to  community  living.    Airmen  with  the  most severe illness or injuries will receive the ongoing oversight of their RCCs/NMCMs and VA FRCs as long as necessary following their separation or retirement from the military service.   18  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 Chapter 4 CONTINUUM OF CARE 4.1.  Recovery, Rehabilitation, Reintegration 4.1.1.  DoD defines the continuum of care as recovery, rehabilitation, and reintegration.  The Air  Force  has  divided  those  stages  into  seven  phases  that  align  better  with  the  Airman’s journey through the continuum of care.  The seven phases also make it easier for the Airman and  their  caregiver  to  understand  where  they  are  in  the  process  and  helps  the  CMT  with trigger points to know when to introduce new members required for each phase of care. 4.1.2.  The  seven  phases  that  are  used  anticipate  the  Airman  and  family  and/or  designated caregivers  needs.    Family  members  and  caregivers  play  an  important  role  in  a  seriously  or severely ill or injured Airman’s recovery and transition. They provide emotional support and stability and assist the Airman in navigating available transition benefits and programs. The Air Force defined phases of the Continuum of Care are: 4.1.2.1.  Identification Phase:  Combat and non-combat ill or injured service members are assigned  a  CMT  consisting  of  an  RCC,  NMCM,  and  a  MCM.    The  RCC  will  make contact within 72 hours of assignment, conduct  an initial assessment of the Airman and family’s  needs  within  5  duty  days,  and  share  this  information  with  the  CMT  within  15 duty days.  Coordination with, and notification to the A&FRC, Unit Leadership, and FLO is essential to properly address needs of the Airman, their family and/or their caregiver. 4.1.2.2.  Recovery and Treatment:  Airmen in this phase are hospitalized.  The MCM will coordinate  the  efforts  of  the  CMT  members.    The  CMT  will  coordinate  prioritized medical and non-medical support and services and begin development of the coordinated ICP.    Whether  the  RSM  starts  out  in  either  Recovery  and  Treatment  or  Rehabilitation phase  of  care,  the  RCC  will  coordinate  with  the  NMCM  regarding  the  Airman’s personnel  and  financial  needs  based  on  initial  and  ongoing  assessment.    This  will normally be accomplished no later than the 15th day from case initiation.  NMCMs will coordinate  resolution  of  those  needs  with  AFPC  and  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting Service (DFAS). 4.1.2.2.1.  At  the  onset,  and  throughout  the  care  management  of  the  Airman,  a member  of  the  CMT  may  be  designated  as  the  lead  coordinator  (LC).    The  LC  is simply a designation for the position that has primacy in that phase of care and is not a separate member of the CMT.  While the LC will be used for certain complex cases, the designation will not be used for all cases.  The designation of an LC is designed to simplify the coordination among CMT members and the Airman, especially in those cases where the VA is involved prior to discharge. 4.1.2.2.2.  In those cases where an LC is designated, that role will transition between CMT  members  based  on  case  primacy  and  the  need  for  coordination.    Because  the triggers  and  timing  of  the  passing  of  the  LC  role  will  be  based  on  circumstances involved in the case, the process for transition will be determined by the members of the CMT. AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   19  4.1.2.3.  Rehabilitation:    Airmen  in  this  phase  are  in  an  outpatient  status.    When  an Airman  is  in  rehabilitative  care  and  reaches  a  point  where  optimal  medical  benefit  is achieved, the CMT coordinates with the Airman, family and caregiver to develop a plan of action for continuance of Air Force service or transition into the civilian  community. Additionally, the CMT will continue to monitor the Airman, family, or caregiver needs; resolve issues (medical, financial, personnel, logistical); and assist with locating services and resources as needed. 4.1.2.4.  Fitness  Evaluation:  Airmen  in  this  phase  are  undergoing  an  MEB/PEB.    The CMT  will  educate  the  Airman  on  full  spectrum  of  the  IDES  and  provide  sound  policy guidance  and  direction  based  on  Airman’s  goals.    The  RCC  and  NMCM  actively advocates for the Airman and monitors the evaluation process, ensures personnel policies are  afforded  as  applicable,  explores  career  and  education  goals,  assesses  financial wellness, and assists the Airman, family and caregiver with their transition goals. 4.1.2.5.  Reintegration/Transition: Airmen in this phase have received a decision from the PEB  and  are  projected  for  separation  or  retirement.    The  NMCM  coordinates  to  ensure the  Airman  is  provided  assistance  with  navigating  his/her  transition  to  the  civilian community.    The  NMCM  assesses  the  Airman’s  needs  and,  with  the  help  of  the  RCC, adjusts  services  to  ensure  the  Airman,  family,  and  caregiver  are  afforded  applicable transition  services.    The  NMCM,  in  coordination  with  the  other  CMT  members, coordinates  a  hand-off  to  outside  agencies  (VA,  Department  of  Labor,  community resources). 4.1.2.6.  Stabilization/Resolution:  Airmen in this phase have returned to duty, separated or  retired  and  are  reintegrating  either  back  into  their  military  or  into  the  civilian community.    The  NMCM  will  continue  to  proactively  foster  resilience,  independence, and stability with the Airman.  Members of the CMT will coordinate with the VA Case Manager  to  ensure  all  applicable  entitlements  and  benefits  have  been  applied  for.  NMCMs,  with  assistance  from  AFPC  specialists,  will  coordinate  transitional  financial assistance and troubleshoot retired pay account issues.  The NMCM with the help of the RCC,  as  necessary,  will  coordinate  with  the  VA  Case  Manager  to  ensure  Airman  is connected to the VA and other agencies.  While it varies from case to case and is always contingent  on  the  RSM’s  needs,  the  goal  of  the  NMCM  is  to  ensure  all  benefits  and entitlements are assured within six months after the RSM leaves military service. 4.1.2.7.  Sustainment:    These  Airmen  have  successfully  reintegrated,  achieved  stability and  have  been  made  fully  aware  of  all  applicable  benefits  and  entitlements.    A  final assessment  will  be  completed  to  confirm  resilience,  independence,  and  stability.  AFPC/DPFW  will  continue  to  provide  outreach  services  through  events  coordination, news bulletins and periodic phone contacts.   WII are  considered “Airman for  Life” and have reachback capability to obtain assistance with issues or concerns.   20  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 Chapter 5 ENROLLMENT PROCESS 5.1.  Enrollment  Process:  The  Air  Force  RCP  exists  to  provide  uniform  care  and  support  for recovering  Airmen  and  their  families  when  the  Airman  has  been  injured  or  has  an  illness  that prevents  him  or  her  from  providing  that  support.    A  large  number  of  Airmen  each  year  are injured  or  become  ill,  because  of  the  demand  on  available  resources,  the  RCP  must  limit enrollment  to  those  Airmen  most  in  need  of  the  care  and  support  the  program  provides.    To ensure  equity  in  consideration  for  the  program,  a  formal  enrollment  evaluation  process  is conducted at AFPC/DPFW.  This process is outlined in the remainder of this chapter. 5.1.1.  Criteria for enrollment.   Airmen will be referred into the program if they meet one of the  following  criteria:    the  Airman  is  identified  as  Seriously  Ill  or  Injured  (SI)  (CAT  2)  or Very Seriously  Ill or Injured (VSI) (CAT 3) on casualty reports, those referred to  IDES for PTSD and/or TBI or complex medical conditions. 5.1.1.1.  Airmen who meet any one of the above criteria, or whose command determines could  potentially  benefit  from  the  program,  may  also  be  referred  from  their  unit,  RCC, local A&FRC or any other source (including self-referral). 5.1.1.2.  Air  Force  Reserve  (AFR)  and  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  Airmen  retained  for more  than  six  months  on  Title  10  medical  orders  or  returned  to  Title  10  orders  with medical  conditions  will  be  referred  into  the  program,  if  they  were  not  referred  into  the program  previous  to  being  identified  otherwise  .    The  AFPC/DPFA  Air  Reserve Component  (ARC)  Case  Management  Division  will  oversee  medical  care  and continuation on medical orders. 5.1.1.3.  Once  initial  eligibility  is  determined  a  completed  WII  Referral  Form  is submitted to the WII Cell and a final decision on enrollment will be made.  The WII Cell consists of a coordinator and three voting members, an RCC, an NMCM and an MCM.  The  coordinator  compiles  the  referrals  and  ensures  the  WII  Referral  is  completed  with enough detail for the voting members to make a decision. The voting members review the documents on each case and provide their decisions to the WII Cell coordinator. 5.1.1.1.1.  If  two  or  more  of  the  voting  members  agree  the  case  meets  criteria  for enrollment in the RCP, the Airman is enrolled. 5.1.1.1.2.  If two or more members determine the case does not meet criteria, then the case is either remanded to the referring agency with specific instruction for additional or  clarifying  information,  or  it  is  sent  to  the  Warrior  and  Survivor  Care  Division Chief for final review and reconsideration. 5.1.1.1.3.  If the  final  decision is  that the case does not  meet  criteria for enrollment, the  WII  Cell  Coordinator  will  notify  the  referring  agency  and/or  the  individual Airman of the decision. 5.1.1.1.4.  A decision against enrollment does not  mean the Airman will not  receive assistance.    The  WII  Cell  Coordinator  will  refer  the  member  to  the  necessary resource(s) to meet their current needs. AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   21  5.1.2.  Once  enrolled,  the  WII  Cell  coordinator  will  contact  each  member  of  the  CMT  and provide  them  the  necessary  information  to  begin  providing  support  to  the  Airman.  Additionally,  the  WII  Cell  will  initiate  the  Master  Case  File  (MCF)  which  will  contain  the WII Referral Worksheet and any additional forms, attachments, and case notes necessary for a  comprehensive  case  file.    Case  files  will  be  maintained  IAW  AFI  33-322,  Records Management  Program  and  remain  active  until  all  identified  needs  are  met,  the  Airman  has completed  transition  out  of  the  military,  the  Airman  no  longer  wants  case  management, contact is lost with the Airman for a period of more than 12 months, or the Airman dies and the family does not desire further assistance. 5.1.2.1.  The NMCM at AFPC/DPFW will maintain the Master Case File (MCF) for each Airman enrolled in the RCP. The RCC will initiate and maintain the ICP which will be merged into the MCF once the Airman has entered the IDES. Additionally, the NMCM will  use  the  assessment  checklist  contained  in  the  Case  Management  database  to document  demographic  data  and  capture  any  other  information  necessary  to  record  all actions, goal achievement, contact/involvement with other government agencies and non-governmental agencies, and assistance provided to the Airman. 5.2.  CMT  members  will:  Collaborate  regularly  to  determine  who  will  work  with  the  Airman and  family  on  each  of  the  goals  identified.    Goals  should  be  specific,  measurable,  attainable, realistic  and  timely.    Action  steps  for  each  identified  goal  should  be  developed  in  a  building block approach with each action accomplished moving the Airman and family one step closer to achieving their ultimate recovery goals.  A specific point of contact should be provided to assist the Airman with each action identified.  The CMT should track the progress of all goals to ensure they  are  completed  in  a  timely  manner,  adjusted  if  necessary,  and  that  they  are  meeting  the Airman’s  needs.    Collaboration  between  CMT  members,  the  Airman  and  their  family,  service providers  and  appropriate  resources  is  key  to  the  success  of  meeting  the  goals.    Continue  to periodically review and assess the needs of the Airman and their family as they progress through the continuum of care as situations, finances, and attitudes may change. 5.3.  Opt Out Procedures 5.3.1.  All programs under the Warrior and Survivor Care umbrella are voluntary.  While the support these programs provide is extremely beneficial to Airmen, the intent is not to add to the stress of the situation by forcing our services onto an Airman and/or family member who do not  want  them.   In those rare  cases  where an  Airman wishes to  opt  out  of the RCP, the following procedures must be followed. 5.3.1.1.  Notify  AFPC/DPFW  Division  Chief  and  prepare  a  case  note  that  reflects Airman’s  desire  not  to  be  contacted.    Update  the  Airman’s  case  file  in  the  Case Management  database  and  conduct  a  review  of  pay  of  all  known  benefits  and entitlements.    If  an  Airman  and/or  family  choose  to  opt  out  of  RCP  support,  include  a case note detailing their choice in the “Contact Details” section of the Airman’s Recovery Coordination  Program-Support  Solution  (RCP-SS)  and  Master  Case  Files.    Review  the case after one year for consideration for closure. 5.3.1.2.  In  the  event  the  Airman  requests  no  information  be  shared  with  a  spouse regarding their care, AFPC/DPFW Division Chief will be notified and the request will be documented in the case file.  When this occurs, the CMT members will honor the request of the Airman, but will reach out to the spouse to determine if the spouse or family has   22  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 any  immediate  needs  that  can  be  supported  such  as  financial,  employment,  medical  for themselves,  or  possibly  counseling  support.    This  can  be  done  without  breeching  the confidence  of  the  Airman.    If  necessary,  the  CMT  may  want  a  different  member  to contact the family for assistance. AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   23  Chapter 6 INTERAGENCY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN (ICP) 6.1.  NOTE:  The  DoD  and  the  VA.  Are  working  to  formally  introduce  the  ICP  to  all Services.    During  this  process,  the  Air  Force  will  continue  to  use  the  Comprehensive Recovery  Plan  (CRP)  and  the  Comprehensive  Transition  Plan  (CTP)  to  conduct  case management.    The  remainder  of  this  document  will  refer  to  the  ICP,  however,  the requirements and procedures listed are consistent with the current use of the CRP/CTP by the Air Force. 6.2.  The  CMT  is  responsible  for:  Overseeing  the  development  of  the  ICP  and  has  the overarching  responsibility  for  coordinating  the  delivery  of  services  and  resources  identified  in the  ICP.    In  most  cases  the  RCC  will  begin  this  process.    This  process  starts  early,  continues regularly,  and  doesn’t  stop  until  the  Airman  has  made  a  successful  transition  back  to  duty  or community  reintegration.    Information  on  procedures,  format  and  content  of  the  ICP  are  as follows: 6.2.1.  Procedures.  The ICP will be entered into RCP-SS and maintained electronically.  The RCP-SS  is  an  Office  of  Secretary  of  Defense  (OSD)  level  virtual  database  that  provides greater security, continuity and management capabilities than paper versions.  The RCP-SS system  is  cleared  to  contain  Personal  Identifiable  Information  (PII)  and  all  users  of  the system  are  required  to  have  PII  training  annually  and  Health  Insurance  Portability  and Accountability Act (HIPAA) training annually to protect against unintended Personal Health Information  (PHI)  sharing  on  RCP-SS.    The  ICP  is  the  primary  guiding  document  for  the non-medical support of the Airman and their family.  It includes a medical and non-medical needs  assessment  to  determine  where  support  is  most  required.    Goals  and  action  steps  are created based on the needs and desires of the recovering Airman and family.  Identified goals must be specific, measurable, and achievable and can be modified at any time by the Airman.  This is why regular reviews must be accomplished to ensure progress is continuing based on the plan. 6.2.1.1.  Goal-Setting.  The RCC will work  with  the entire CMT, the Airman, and their family/caregiver to  set  goals  consistent with  the Airman’s needs and medical  condition.  Goals will be prioritized and contain specific action steps. 6.2.1.2.  Creating  Action  Steps.    Action  steps  will  be  created  in  coordination  with  the Airman,  family  and  CMT.    Action  steps  must  be  specific,  measurable  and  achievable within an agreed upon time frame.  In addition, each action step must include a point of contact  for  each  step,  support  and  resources  available  to  the  Airman  and  family,  and location of the support and resources. 6.2.1.3.  Accepting the Plan.  The Airman, family, RCC and other members of the CMT will review and agree upon the goals and action steps included in the ICP.  The Airman and  family  or  designated  caregiver,  and  the  RCC  shall  review  the  ICP  and  sign  the document,  demonstrating  their  understanding  of  the  plan  and  commitment  to  its implementation.  Finally, a hard copy will be provided to the Airman and family (when appropriate) upon completion.  The RCC and Airman may not be collocated so an email with  acknowledgement  of records  as receipt  will  suffice for the  official   24  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 coordination/signature of the Airman until  such time as the Airman is  able to  provide a signed copy to the RCC.  The RCC will ensure a scanned or electronic copy is attached to the Master Case File.  Information tracked and collected is maintained in the DoD Case Management System (DoD-CMS) case file.  The DoD-CMS is approved for collection of PII  information  and  is  included  in  the  Federal  Registry.    The  information  is  protected through  controlled  access  and  further  protected  within  roles  and  only  the  case  manager and  supervisor  can  see  the  information.    Case  files  are  maintained  either  as  active, suspended,  or  closed  in  the  DoD-CMS.    A  Systems  of  Record  Notice  is  on  file  and  is available through the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Warrior Care Policy or may be obtained  by  contacting  AF/A1SAZ.    Case  information  contained  in  other  databases, systems or files will be maintained according to prescribed file plan. 6.2.1.4.  Reviewing.  The appropriate CMT member will review the ICP with the Airman and  family  as  frequently  as  necessary,  but  not  less  than  every  30  days,  based  on  the individual  needs  of  the  Airman  and  family.    The  ICP  will  be  re-evaluated  and  updated before  transition  phases  in  an  Airman’s  care,  such  as  change  in  location,  family  status, financial  status,  etc.    A  new  hard  copy  will  be  provided  to  the  Airman  and  family whenever  changes  are  made  to  the  document  and  the  document  must  be  resigned whenever changes are made.  RCCs will ensure the ICP signature is reflected in RCP-SS with the appropriate signature date. 6.2.1.5.  Closing  out  the ICP.    An  ICP  may  be  closed  out  when  the  Airman  has  met  all goals or declines any further support.  All documents will be kept in accordance with the appropriate records disposition schedule.  Once closed out, the ICP will be maintained as part  of  the  Master  Case  File  and  will  be  moved  to  either  the  Suspended  or  Closed  Out sections of RCP-SS and can be re-activated by a supervisor if necessary. 6.3.  Recovery Care Process 6.3.1.  The following task list may not be all inclusive.  Each RCC must use professional and personal  experience  and  judgment  to  leverage  the  unique  aspects  of  their  region  and  local resource structure to  address  and mitigate case-by-case challenges.  Each RCC should seek advice from their peers, other CMT members, or Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). 6.3.1.1.  Start an ICP in RCP-SS within 3 business days of assignment, depending on the mental  and  physical  condition/capability  of  the  Airman.    Make  initial  contact  with  the assigned Airman and family in person if at all possible.  Face-to-face contact/introduction is  the  required  method  of  introduction  and  if  not  feasible,  the  RCC  must  annotate  the reason in RCP-SS and notify AFPC/DPFW.  If the Airman is in critical condition it may be  appropriate  to  conduct  a  preliminary  needs  assessment  with  the  Airman’s  family.  When  the  Airman’s  medical  condition  allows,  the  RCC  shall  conduct  an  interview utilizing the comprehensive needs assessment checklist.  During the interview, the RCC shall  provide  at  a  minimum,  CMT  points  of  contact  (including  websites  and  toll-free numbers as appropriate) and information on the RCP. 6.3.1.1.1.  RCCs  must  ensure  the  Airman  understands  they  will  interact  with  their family.  There may be unique occasions when an Airman does not want their family to receive support or wants to omit a family member(s) from being contacted.  Should the Airman choose not to participate, the RCC will document declination (to include date and time) in the contact section of the case file in RCP-SS and notify the RCC AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   25  Program  Manager  (RCC  PM)  via  email  to  suspend  the  case.    The  RCC  PM  will suspend the case file and notify AFPC/DPFW of the action.  The RCC will continue to be accessible to provide support to the Airman and his family.  If at a future date the  Airman  changes  their  mind  the  RCC  will  reactivate  the  case  file  and  include  a note in the contact section stating the date and time of the Airman’s decision and will notify the RCC PM. 6.3.1.1.2.  The  RCC  should  obtain  a  signed  copy  of  the  Privacy  Act  Statement  and DD Form 2870, Authorization  for  Disclosure  of  Medical  or  Dental  Information, then upload and attach the document to the Airman’s case in RCP-SS. If the Airman is  unable  to  sign  the  document  for  reasons  related  to  their  own  physical  or  mental capability  then  an  individual  with  a  general  power  of  attorney  may  sign  on  their behalf.  If RCCs cannot obtain a signed Privacy Act Statement within two weeks of assignment, then the RCC should bring this to the attention of the RCC PM who will in turn notify AFPC/DPFW.  All circumstances surrounding an unsigned Privacy Act Statement  and  DD  Form  2870  should  be  clearly  documented  in  RCP-SS.    Any situation  where  the  lack  of  a  signed  Privacy  Act  Statement  hinders  support  to  the Airman  should  also  be  noted  in  RCP-SS.    A  separate  DD  Form  2870  must  be obtained  for  transfer  of  any  related  case  management  documentation  for  each organization outside the Air Force that may require it.  This  includes the need for  a specific  signed  DD  Form  2870  prior  to  the  transfer  of  any  information  to  the  VA when the Airman is not in the IDES process. 6.3.1.1.3.  Ensure documentation in RCP-SS is updated regularly; at a minimum with each substantial contact. Make adequate time on a weekly basis to update case notes. Regularly  review  the  CRP  and  make  modifications  in  conjunction  with  the  CMT supporting  the  Airman  and  family.    Review  the  goals  established  in  the  CRP,  and their status, with other CMT members on a regular basis.  This allows CMT members to  address  challenges and help  the Airman achieve their  goals.   The CMT members must  coordinate  their  actions  to  eliminate  redundancies,  overlaps  and  confusion  on the part of the Airman as to who is working what issue. 6.3.1.2.  Contact  is  defined  by  face-to-face  visits,  telephone  calls,  e-mails,  or  text messages  and  requires  a  back  and  forth  dialogue  sufficient  for  the  RCC  to  be  satisfied that the objectives of the contact were met. Objectives may include providing the Airman a  resource,  obtaining  a  status  update  from  the  Airman,  or  engaging  in  ongoing  goal development.    Preferably,  each  contact  should  involve  a  review  of  the  action  items addressed  at  the  last  meeting.    The  frequency  of  contact  between  an  RCC,  the  Airman and  their  family  will  depend  on  the  location,  the  Airman’s  medical  and  personal  acuity level,  and  determined  family  needs.    RCCs  should  use  their  professional  judgment  to determine the level and frequency of support. 6.3.1.2.1.  An RCC must establish initial contact with an Airman or family within 72 hours of assignment.  If at least three attempts to contact have been made during the 72 hour period and the  Airman does not  respond then immediately inform  the RCC PM of communication issues and document accordingly. 6.3.1.2.2.  Convalescent  Leave.    Airmen  convalescing  at  their  home  of  record  may not  have  the  daily  interaction  with  medical  staff,  the  unit  leadership  or  CMT  care   26  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 coordination.   In these cases consider more frequent visits and phone conversations.  If the convalescent leave occurs in a different region, the RCC will affect a handoff to the local RCC or, at minimum, will involve the local RCC in supporting the Airman during their convalescence. AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   27  Chapter 7 TRAINING REQUIREMENTS 7.1.  Training Requirements 7.1.1.  AF/A1SAZ  and  AFPC/DPFW  program  managers  ensure  all  newly  hired  RCCs  and NMCMs receive the required DoD RCC Training and service-specific training.  This training must  be  accomplished  within  120  days  of  hire  based  on  DoD  scheduling.    When  DoD training  is  delayed,  AFPC/DPFW  will  implement  a  peer-to-peer  training  program  and  a mentorship  program  to  train  and equip  the RCCs and NMCMs to  be able to  carry out  their duties without limitations. (T-2) 7.1.2.  AFPC/DPFW  provides  initial,  quarterly,  annual  and  ad  hoc  training  as  necessary  for all RCCs and NMCMs as applicable.  Additional training will be conducted throughout the year via teleconference, video teleconference, or web based.  Training platforms are based on program  changes,  current  trends,  and  policy  changes.    All  training  events  must  have  an agenda approved by AFPC/DPFW Division Chief and attendance will be documented.  The agenda  and  attendance  will  be  submitted  through  AFPC/DPFW  to  AF/A1SAZ  upon completion  of  the  training.    DoD  requires  proof  of  training  for  each  event  and  AF/A1SAZ will be responsible for submitting the documents to DoD.  (T-2)   28  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 Chapter 8 PERSONNEL POLICIES 8.1.  Combat-Related RIs (RI): 8.1.1.  The Air Force has developed a set of exceptional personnel policies for those Airmen who suffer a serious combat-related injury or illness.  In order to identify Airmen eligible for these  exceptional  policies,  the  Air  Force  Wounded  Warrior  Program  created  unique Reporting Identifiers (RIs) that are updated in the Airman’s personnel record.  These RIs are: 8.1.1.1.  RI  9W000  (enlisted)/92W0  (officers):    The  initial  designation  of  this  RI  is provided  solely  for  the  purpose  of  identifying  Airmen  who  have  suffered  a  combat-related illness or injury.  This RI will be applied and updated in Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) initially by the WII Cell when there is good evidence that the Airman’s illness or injury was a direct result of combat.  The primary sources of identification for this  RI  will  be  those  categorized  as  SI  or  VSI  combat  injured  warriors  on  the  Casualty Morning Report (CMR) or as determined by the medical community.  When the medical evaluation  process  returns  the  Airman  to  duty  the  RI  will  remain.  If  the  PEB  final authority  decision  is  that  the  injury  or  illness  is  not  combat-related,  the  RI  will  be changed  in  MilPDS  to  RI  9W300  or  92W3,  accordingly..    Lastly,  if  the  PEB  final authority decides the injury is  combat related, the AFPC/DPFW Data Manager will use the  separation/retirement  order  as  verification  to  update  the  Airman’s  RI  as  9W200 before the Airman separates from the service. 8.1.1.2.  RI  9W200  (enlisted)/92W2  (officers):    This  RI  provides  exceptional  personnel policies  (i.e.,  promotion,  evaluation,  assignment,  and  professional  military  education exemptions,  etc.,)  for  Airmen  who  sustained  very  serious  combat-related  injuries, severely  disabling  illnesses,  or  loss  of  cognitive  abilities  requiring  a  lengthy  period  of recovery or rehabilitation that removes him or her from their normal duties. The RI does not confer any other combat-related benefit or entitlement, and is not considered to be the final  authority.  If  the  PEB  final  authority  decides  the  injury  is  combat  related,  the AFPC/DPFW  Data  Manager  will  use  the  separation/retirement  order  as  verification  to update the Airman’s RI as 9W200 before the Airman separates from the service.  If the PEB final authority decision is that the injury or illness is not combat-related, the RI will be  changed  in  MilPDS  to  RI  9W300  or  92W3,  accordingly.  If  the  PEB  final  authority decision is that the injury or illness is not combat-related, the RI will be removed by the AFPC/DPFW Data Manager. 8.1.1.2.1.  In  order  to  be  awarded  the  9W200  or  92W2  RI  prior  to  the  PEB  final decision authority, a DoD medical authority (Primary Care Manager or Mental Health Provider) must confirm that the injury or illness is combat related.  When the primary condition is within the mental health arena such as PTSD, a Mental Health Provider should  make  the  final  determination.    The  certifying  medical  authority  should understand  by  doing  so  they  may  be  authorizing  personnel  policy  exemptions  not afforded to  others.  After receiving the  confirmation  from  a DoD medical authority, AFW2  leadership  will  make  the  final  decision  whether  RI  9W200  or  92W2  will  be awarded as it pertains to this paragraph based on all the evidence available. AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   29  8.1.1.3.  RI  9W300  (enlisted)/92W3  (officers):    The  initial  designation  of  this  RI  is provided  solely  for  the  purpose  of  identifying  Airmen  enrolled  in  AFW2  with  non-combat-related  illnesses  or  injuries.  This  RI  will  be  applied  and  updated  in  Military Personnel  Data  System  (MilPDS)  by  either  the  WII  Cell  or  the  AFPC/DPFW  Data Manager.  When the medical evaluation process returns the Airman to duty this RI will remain. 8.1.1.4.  RI  9W400  (enlisted)/92W4  (officers):    Combat-injured  warriors  Returned  To Duty  under the Limited Assignment Status (LAS) program will be awarded the 9W400 or 92W4 RI.  AFPC/DPFD is the final approval authority for LAS.  Retention is not for a specified  period  of  time,  but  does  not  exceed  20  years  of  active  service.    AFPC/DPFD reevaluates  LAS  eligibility  at  least  once  a  year.    This  RI  will  be  updated  by  the AFPC/DPFW Data Manager when applicable. 8.2.  An LOD determination is:  A finding made after an investigation into the circumstances of a  member’s  illness,  injury,  disease  or  death.  The  finding  determines:  (1)  whether  or  not  the illness,  injury  or  disease  existed  prior  to  service  (EPTS)  and  if  an  EPTS  condition  was aggravated by military service;  (2) whether or not  the illness, injury, disease or death  occurred while the member was absent without authority and (3) whether or not the illness, injury, disease or death was due to the member’s misconduct.  See AFI 36-2910 for more information on LOD determination. 8.3.  Airmen receiving a Selective Reenlistment Bonus or Officers receiving a Critical Skills Retention  Bonus,  should:  Be  counseled  regarding  payment,  recoupment,  or  future  payments based  on  current  Air  Force  policy.    Each  case  must  be  carefully  researched  and  coordinated between the Airman/Officer, the base MPS and/or AFPC Office of Responsibility, and the base FSO and/or DFAS to ensure proper payment or recoupment is made. 8.4.  Home  of  Selection  entitlement  is:  Provided  for  Medically  Retired  or  Discharged personnel. Airmen have up to a one year from their retirement or separation effective date to use this  benefit.    In  the  event  an  extension is  needed  beyond  one  year,  Airmen  are  to  contact  their NMCM  for  further  guidance.    EXCEPTION:      When  an  Airman  has  an  authorization  to  ship household goods (HHGs) under separation or retirement orders and receives a subsequent HHG authorization  (i.e.,  Airman  becomes  a  DoD  civilian  employee,  Airman  married  to  a  federal employee);  the  Airman  is  entitled  to  the  greater  of  the  two  allowances/benefits,  but  not  both.  The  Government  has  but  one  financial  obligation  in  relocating  HHGs  upon  termination/release from  active  duty.    Upon  receipt  of  the  subsequent  authorization,  all  travel  and  shipping entitlements  under  military  orders  will  cease.    Dual  entitlements  are  not  authorized  under uniformed service orders in conjunction with any other federal service orders. This determination is supported by the Comptroller General in decisions B-202023, 4 Dec 1981 and 54 Comp Gen 847 and 892 (1975). 8.5.  Fitness  Testing:  All  Airmen  are  expected  to  adhere  to  the  requirements  of  fit  test  as outlined in AFI 36-2905 Fitness Program based on medical profile. 8.6.  Transfer of 9/11 GI Bill 8.6.1.  If an Airman wishes to share their education benefits with any member of their family, they must convert from the Montgomery GI Bill to the Post 9/11 GI Bill Benefit.  Either the RCC or NMCM will assess the eligibility of each Airman  who wishes to transfer their Post   30  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 9/11  GI  Bill  benefits  to  their  dependents  prior  to  their  disability  separation/retirement  and advise/assist Airmen as needed. 8.6.1.1.  Those  Airmen  who  did  not  transfer  their  Post  9/11  GI  Bill  benefit  prior  to leaving  active duty but still wish to  do so, must  complete a DD Form 149, Application For  Correction  of  Military  Record  (with  justification),  and  submit  it  to  the  Air  Force Board  of  Correction  of  Military  Records  (AFBCMR).    The  RCC  and/or  NMCM  will work  with  the  Airman  to  ensure  the  form  is  complete  and  includes  appropriate justification. 8.7.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) 8.7.1.  Combat-related  injured  or  ill  Airmen  may  continue  to  participate  in  their  current degree  program  of  enrollment  at  the  time  of  their  separation  or  retirement.    This  provides them  with  sufficient  time  to  complete  their  degrees  because  their  careers  were  shortened unexpectedly  by  serious  combat-related  injury  or  illness.  No  new  programs  may  be  started after separation. 8.7.1.1.  To  qualify,  the  Airman  must  have  been  awarded  a  9W-series  RI.  Airmen  have 10  years  from  their  Date  of  Separation  (DOS)  or  from  30  Dec  2011  if  their  DOS  is between 12 Sep 01 and 30 Dec 2011 to complete degree requirements. 8.7.2.  Airmen  who  have  already  completed  CCAF  can  obtain  a  copy  of  their  certificate  or transcript by visiting http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/transcripts.asp. 8.7.3.  For more information regarding this program, contact the local Education Office. 8.8.  DD Form 214. 8.8.1.  Retiring  or  separating  Airmen  will  review  their  DD  Form  214  for  accuracy.    If  any additions  or corrections  are needed, the Airman  can initiate a  correction  worksheet  through vMPF or contact their servicing MPF.  If any assistance is required, the Airman can contact their NMCM or RCC for assistance. 8.8.1.1.  NMCMs  will  advise  Airmen  on  the  receipt  and  distribution  of  their  final  DD Form 214 to VA to ensure timely approval of benefits and entitlements. 8.8.1.2.  If errors are discovered on the official DD Form 214 after the effective date of retirement, the Airman should contact the RCC or NMCM prior to submitting a DD Form 149,  Application  for  Correction  of  Military  Record,  to  request  an  Air  Force  Board  for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) action.  If applicable, the Airman may obtain a following  website: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/eforms/dd0149.pdf    or  contact  the RCC or NMCM. the  DD  Form copy 149 of by visiting the 8.9.  Limited Assignment Status (LAS) 8.9.1.  The LAS program is utilized by the Physical Disability Division to retain Airmen on active duty who have been determined unfit for continued service but who have unique skills and can perform in a limited status.  Retention under LAS depends upon the type and extent of the Airman’s physical defect or condition, the amount of medical management and support needed  to  sustain  the  Airman  on  active  duty,  the  physical  and  assignment  limitations AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   31  required, the years of service completed and the Air Force “need” for the particular grade and specialty. 8.9.1.1.  There  is  no  minimum  time  in  service  requirement  for  combat  related  illness  or injury. 8.9.1.2.  Retention  is  not  for  a  specified  period  of  time,  but  cannot  exceed  20  years  of active  duty  service.    The  Military  Treatment  Facility  (MTF)  examines  LAS  Airmen  at least once a year, or as directed by AFPC/DPFD, to determine whether or not the Airman is still considered medically acceptable for retention in LAS.  The report of examination shows the current status of the unfitting physical defects or conditions for which retained in  LAS  and  the  status  of  any  additional  physical  defects  or  conditions  that  may  affect duty  performance.  Eligibility  and  further  instructions  for  LAS  can  be  found  in  AFI  36-3212. 8.10.  Assignments 8.10.1.  Airmen who are pending an MEB or PEB, and on an Assignment Availability Code 37, normally may not be reassigned PCS or placed in TDY status until the MTF determines medical disposition. Instruction on assignment limitations can be found in AFI 36-2110. 8.11.  Promotions 8.11.1.  Enlisted.

Appoint FLOs:  For all affected families within 24 hours of notification of a seriously ill or injured service member.  For ANG, assign a FLO from the installations Active Guard Reserves (AGRs)  or  Full-Time  Technicians  within  Airman’s  own  squadron,  or  within  the  appropriate group. (T-3) 9.2.  The FLO program is:  Designed to provide a single focal point for the Airman’s family to receive Air Force resource assistance, and compassionate non-clinical care during a very difficult time.  The program provides all available resources in support of family needs when an Airman becomes  seriously  ill  or  injured.    Additionally,  the  program  provides  a  systematic  structure through which offers of assistance, information and support are made available on the family’s terms.  Support will be made available until the Airman has stabilized and long-term support is in place. 9.3.  FLOs  are  appointed  to:  Assist the family of seriously or very seriously ill or injured (SI or  VSI)  Airmen  navigate  the  various  agencies  involved  in  recovery,  rehabilitation  and reintegration. The FLO is also the link between the family and the Airman’s unit.  When a FLO is  warranted,  AFPC/DPFW  will  make  a  request  for  FLO  contact  information  with  the commander responsible for the assignment of FLO.  FLO assignment will be limited to 30 days, however,  when  applicable,  the  assignment  may  be  extended  up  to  60  days  with  AFPC/DPF approval. 9.3.1.  A  FLO  will  be  appointed  when  a  medical  authority  initiates  Emergency  Family Member Travel (EFMT) orders through the Casualty office for family to be at the beside of an Airman. 9.3.1.1.  The  Air  Force  provides  round-trip  transportation  and  Per  Diem  in  accordance with  the  Joint  Federal  Travel  Regulation  (JFTR)  (U5246)  for  not  more  than  three designated  individuals  to  the  medical  facility  of  an  Airman  listed  as  VSI  or  SI  casualty when  hospitalized  in  or  outside  the  United  States,  if  the  attending  physician  or  surgeon and the commander or head of the military treatment facility exercising military control over the Airman determine that the presence of the designated individual may contribute to the Airman’s health and welfare for a period of up to 30 days (Title 37, U.S.C, Section 411h).  In addition, EFMT applies to Airmen who are deployed on Contingency Exercise Deployment  (CED)  orders  and  who  are  hospitalized  and  have  been  placed  in  a  Hostile Not  Seriously  Ill/Injured  (NSI)  casualty  status.    Detailed  information  on  EFMT  can  be found in AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services. 9.3.2.  Commanders may appoint a FLO in the following circumstances: 9.3.2.1.  When  the  Airman  is  being  treated  at  a  location  away  from  their  base  of assignment and EFMT orders are initiated. 9.3.2.2.  When a Wounded in Action Airman is medically evacuated (regardless of their Casualty status). 9.3.2.3.  When in the best interest of the Air Force, the unit or the mission. AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   33  9.4.  Unit  commanders  are  responsible  for:  Selecting  the  FLO  and  providing  their  contact information to AFPC/DPFW.  The initial period of assignment will be 30 days.  The orders must provide for either a government vehicle or a rental vehicle.  All cost incurred will be funded by the  Airman’s  home  unit.    The  unit  should  also  provide  a  pre-paid  or  unit  mobile  phone  for official business. 9.4.1.  The  commander  may  terminate  the  FLO  assignment  prior  to  the  end  of  the  30  day period when the CMT has appropriate assets in place to provide assistance to the family after they are settled.  AFPC/DPFW should be notified if there is change to or termination of the FLO. 9.4.2.  The  overarching  consideration  for  selecting  a  FLO  should  be  on  the  basis  of  the individual’s capacity to  assist  an Airman’s family  in  need. Only volunteers should serve as FLOs,  however,  FLOs  will  be  appointed  if  sufficient  volunteers  cannot  be  found.  Commanders  and  First  Sergeants  should  not  serve  as  FLOs  as  their  responsibility  is  to  the unit as a whole.  FLO’s will be released from regular duties in order to perform FLO duties full-time,  to  include  outside  normal  duty  hours.    FLO’s  should  not  be  recalled  to  normal duties  until  their  responsibilities  are  fulfilled.  If  the  Commander  chooses  to  relieve  a  FLO prior to the fulfillment of their duties, AFPC/DPFW should be notified.  Guidelines for FLO selection include: 9.4.3.  FLOs should hold the military rank of E-7 or higher and civilians should be GS-9 or higher.  A lower ranking individual may be appointed when the commander is confident of the individual’s maturity and abilities. 9.4.4.  The unit’s mission and composition, and the potential FLOs frequency of deployments or scheduled TDYs not related to FLO duties. 9.4.5.  Whenever  possible,  the  FLO  should  hold  the  same  AFSC  and  type  of  job  as  the seriously ill or injured Airman. 9.5.  AFPC/DPFW will:  Conduct FLO training to include additional training from other support agencies, as appropriate.  Training materials will be made available along with a contact number for  questions  and  clarification.  Training  must  be  accomplished  each  time  an  individual  is selected  to  perform  FLO  duties.    After  the  initial  certification  any  additional  training  will  be conducted through use of online material. 9.6.  A listing of mandatory duties and responsibilities can be found on the:  FLO Checklist in which additions may be applied as appropriate, when the situation is warranted.  The FLO is not expected to be the expert, but rather to help the Airman’s family navigate the various support agencies.    FLOs  must  understand  the  nature  of  the  expertise  various  functional  specialists  can bring  to  families  and  refer  to  those  functional  specialists  for  thorough  answers  to  specific questions or to address family needs.  When the needs of the Airman or family become too great to  address  without  assistance;  or  unforeseen  situations  arise,  the  FLO  should  contact  their commander or AFPC/DPFW for guidance. 9.6.1.  The  following  is  a  non-inclusive  list  of  duties  and  responsibilities  not  performed  by the FLO; rather, the FLO should alert the appropriate agency that such care is needed: 9.6.1.1.  Grief, bereavement or other types of counseling.   34  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 9.6.1.2.  Housekeeping,  cleaning,  babysitting,  cooking  or  other  household  chores.  The FLO should coordinate assistance from unit volunteers or support agencies to meet these needs. 9.6.1.3.  Personal or medical services such as helping the ill or injured Airman dress wash or change bandages. 9.6.1.4.  Provide  transportation  in  their  privately  owned  vehicles  other  than  meeting  the family  members  at  the  airport  or  infrequent  trips  to  military  offices.  FLO  orders  will provide for a government vehicle or when necessary, a rental vehicle. AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   35  Chapter 10 SPECIAL COMPENSATION FOR ASSISTANCE WITH ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (SCAADL) 10.1.

The determination an Airman is catastrophically disabled shall be made by a licensed DoD or VA physician. 10.8.2.1.  For  the  purposes  of  this  program,  an  Airman  that  is  catastrophically  disabled has a permanent  severely  disabling injury, disorder, or illness incurred or aggravated in the line of duty that compromises the ability of the afflicted person to carry out ADLs to such a degree that the person requires personal or mechanical assistance to leave home or bed, or constant supervision to avoid physical harm to self or others. 10.8.2.2.  ADL  is  defined  in  DoDI  1341.12  as  follows:  Feeds  (including  special  diets), dresses  and  shelters;  personal  hygiene  services;  observation  and  general  monitoring; bowel training or management (unless abnormalities in bowel  function are of a severity to result in a need for medical or surgical intervention in the absence of skilled services); safety precautions;  general  preventive procedures (such as turning to  prevent  bedsores); passive  exercise;  transportation;  and  other  such  elements  of  personal  care  that  can reasonably be performed by  an untrained adult with minimal  instruction or supervision. ADL may also be referred to as “essentials of daily living” as defined in part 199.2(b) of title 32, Code of  Federal Regulations (Reference  (f)).  For the purposes of eligibility  for SCAADL, ADL and “personal functions required in everyday living” are the same. 10.8.3.  The installation MTF is responsible for identifying inpatient individuals eligible for the program based on projected need for assistance with ADLs and will initiate and complete DD Form 2948.  Airmen that are outpatients may be identified by any member of the RT or the  family  and  the  MTF  will,  when  notified  of  a  potential  qualified  applicant,  initiate  and complete the DD Form 2948. (T-0) 10.8.3.1.  The  person  completing  the  DD  Form  2948  must  ensure  the  identification section  on  the  form  includes  the  Airman’s  current  residence  address  with  a  valid  zip code. The zip code is vital in determining the dollar amount paid to the Airman 10.8.3.2.  The scoring section of the DD Form 2948 includes two areas that the physician must complete. 10.8.3.2.1.  The  first  determines  the  level  of  assistance  required  for  the  seven  areas considered  as  ADL.    These  include  eating,  grooming,  bathing,  dressing,  toileting, assistance with a prosthetic or other device, and difficulty with mobility.  Each area is graded on a scale of 0 to 4 with zero being “Complete Independence” and four being “Total Dependence”. AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   39  10.8.3.2.2.  The second scoring area covers the Airman’s need for supervision and/or protection  and  provides  evaluation  of things  as  difficulty  with planning/organizing, safety risks, difficulty with sleep regulation, and difficulty with recent memory.  Seven areas in all using the same scoring scale as detailed above. such 10.8.3.2.3.  Both  area  scores  are  added  together  to  determine  the  total  score  for  the Airman.    The  total  score  is  used  to  place  the  Airmen  in  one  of  three  tiers  used  to determine payment 10.8.3.2.4.  The  last  portion  of  the  form  requires  the  signatures  of  the  person completing  the  form  and  the  physician.    The  Airman  must  acknowledge  the assessment  and  annotate  agreement  or  the  desire  to  appeal  the  rating    Once  the scoring is complete, the Airman will be rated as follows: 10.8.3.2.4.1.  Low Tier  (Tier 1):  Airman who scores 1  – 12 will be presumed to require 10 hours of caregiver assistance per week. 10.8.3.2.4.2.  Medium Tier (Tier 2): Airman who scores 13 – 20 will be presumed to require 25 hours per week of caregiver assistance. 10.8.3.2.4.3.  High  Tier  (Tier  3):  Airman  who  scores  21  or  higher  will  be presumed  to  need  a  full-time  caregiver  who  provides  40  hours  of  personal  care services per week. 10.8.3.2.5.  The tier level, along with the zip code of the Airman’s current residence, are  entered  into  a  calculator  provided  by  the  DOL  and  the  VA  to  determine  the amount of the monthly benefit, paid to the Airman to help the caregiver.  The higher the  tier  level,  the  higher  the  pay.    For  example,  an  Airman  in  a,  Tier  1  at  zip  code 22408 would receive $543.75 per month and Tier 2 at same zip code would receive $1359.38.  There is also a difference based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics cost for care in each zip code, i.e., Tier 3 in  zip code 22408 would pay $2175.00 per month while Tier 3 in zip code 91210 would pay $2274.18. 10.8.3.2.6.  As  the  Airman  progresses  through  recovery,  if  their  ability  to  care  for themselves  changes,  the  CMT  will  initiate  a  re-evaluation  and  his/her  score  may decrease or increase resulting in a change in the amount of pay received each month. 10.8.3.2.7.  The  start  of  SCAADL  payment  is  based  on  the  date  the  physician  signs the DD Form 2948.  If there is a delay in processing, the pay date remains the day the doctor signed the form and the Airman will be paid any amount owed from that date in  their  first  payment.    Payment  is  identified  on  the  Airman’s  Leave  and  Earnings Statement as “Save Pay”. 10.8.3.2.7.1.  Active  Duty  Airmen  will  receive  SCAADL  as  part  of  their normal twice-monthly pay, and is fully taxable. 10.8.3.2.7.2.  ARC Airmen will receive SCAADL once a month towards the end of each month, and the payment is fully taxable. 10.8.3.2.8.  SCAADL  payment  amounts  are  based  on  geographic  location  and  the level of care required.  Payment amounts can change when an Airmen moves and/or when their condition changes.   40  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 10.8.3.2.9.  The  person  completing  the  form  will  include  the  designated  caregiver’s name, relationship  to  Airman, email  address  and phone number in  any open area of the form. 10.9.  Application Process: 10.9.1.  Airmen  who  qualify  for  SCAADL  are  not  required  to  self-identify,  although  they may.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  CMT  to  ensure  the  Airman  designated  as  having  a catastrophic  condition,  along  with  the  Airman’s  family  and/or  caregiver  are  thoroughly counseled and advised on the SCAADL program prior to discharge from inpatient status.  In those  instances  where  the  Airman  is  not  identified  during  their  inpatient  status,  the counseling will be conducted as soon as possible.  Counseling will cover: 10.9.1.1.  What makes the Airman eligible for SCAADL. 10.9.1.2.  The requirement to designate a primary caregiver to provide non-medical care, support, and assistance. 10.9.1.2.1.  The caregiver does not have to be a family member, but cannot be another military member. 10.9.1.2.2.  The designated primary caregiver does not have to be the only person to provide  care,  but  is  the  person  the  Airman  has  designated  as  having  primary responsibility for coordinating and ensuring care is provided. 10.9.1.3.  How long the Airman can expect to receive SCAADL, depends upon his or her eligibility or loss of eligibility, and the requirements for transition to the Veterans Affairs (VA) Caregiver Program that is the equivalent of SCAADL. 10.9.1.4.  The  amount  of  monthly  compensation  stated  in  the  DD  Form  2948  or  an estimate based on each tier level if the physician has yet to complete the DD Form 2948. 10.9.2.  The counseling should be documented by the RCC or NMCM in the notes section of the Comprehensive Recovery Plan. 10.10.  Appeals Process 10.10.1.  The Airman has the right to appeal the physician’s assessment on the DD Form2948 if  he  or  she  feels  the  determination  is  incorrect.    The  Airman,  or  their  legal  representative when necessary, will sign the form after the physician has made their determination.  Since some  physicians  will  do  a  records-only  review  as  their  clinical  evaluation  to  determine  the level  of  care  required  for  activities  of  daily  living  or  supervision/protection  required,  the Airman  may  believe  the  ratings  do  not  adequately  reflect  their  current  situation.    If  the Airman  believes  their  situation  merits  another  look,  they  may  appeal  by  indicating  their preference to do so in the designated area in the signature block of the DD Form 2948.  The Airman or designated caregiver may submit a statement with their appeal to help convey to their medical reviewer their concerns and why they warrant reconsideration of SCAADL. 10.10.2.  Once  the  Airman  has  indicated  their  desire  to  appeal,  the  DD  Form  2948  will  be submitted to AFPC/DPFW to begin payment based on the initial score and AFPC/DPFW will ensure the CMT has submitted the case to the Medical Unit Commander or senior physician for  review.    The  Commander  or  senior  physician  will  determine  whether  they  will  conduct the  review  for  the  appeal  themselves  or  whether  they  will  appoint  another  physician  (other AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   41  than the original physician) to conduct the review.  In the case where the original scoring was based  on  a  records  review  only,  the  physician  handling  the  appeal  will  conduct  a  personal clinical evaluation rather than a records review, to determine if the original scores should be adjusted. 10.10.3.  The  reviewing  physician  will  make  the  final  determination  and  will  submit  a revised DD Form 2948, with the Airman’s signature, to AFPC/DPFW within 30 days of the original  assessment  to  minimize  potential  overpayment  or  underpayment  to  the  Airman.  Once  submitted,  this  will  be  considered  the  final  adjudication  of  the  Airman’s  current situation. 10.10.3.1.  If a decrease in dependency level is determined, the effective date will be the date on the revised DD Form 2948.  If an increase in dependency level is determined, the effective date remains the same as the original DD Form 2948. 10.11.  Continuous Evaluation. 10.11.1.  Throughout  the  course  of  care,  treatment,  and  time  the  Airman’s  situation  may change  significantly.    The  medical  unit,  PCM  or  RT  members  will  review  SCAADL eligibility every 180 days, or when the Airman’s condition changes, to ensure the Airman is receiving  the  proper  compensation  for  his/her  caregiver.  While  the  hope  is  the  Airman continues  to  improve  and  become  self-sufficient,  some  situations  may  exist  where  the Airman  may  digress  in  their  recovery  and  require  a  greater  amount  of  care.    Maintaining visibility  on  this  program  will  help  minimize  the  financial  burden  on  the  Airman  and  the family. (T-0) 10.11.2.  SCAADL  can  be  adjusted  sooner  than  every  180  days  based  on  changes  in  the progress of the Airman and only requires a new evaluation from a VA or DoD physician and submission of the DD Form 2948 to update the level of care being provided.  Any adjustment to  scores on the DD Form  2946 will be processed for changes in  payment  within five days from the date the form is received by AFPC/DPFW. (T-0) 10.12.  Termination of Compensation. 10.12.1.  Qualified  Airmen  will  continue  to  receive  payments  from  the  date  the  DD Form2948 is signed until the earliest date of the following conditions: 10.12.1.1.  The last day  of the month during which a 90-day period ends that begins  on the date of the separation or retirement of the Airman (e.g., March 1, 2014 + 90 days = June 1 2014 (last day of entitlement is June 30, 2014)). 10.12.1.2.  The last day of the month during which the Airman dies. 10.12.1.3.  The last day of the month during which a physician determines the Airman is no  longer  afflicted  with  the  catastrophic  injury  or  illness.    An  Airman  is  not  entitled  to SCAADL if the Airman is no longer afflicted with a catastrophic illness or injury whether or  not  he/she  has  met  with  a  physician.    RCCs  and  NMCMs  will  assist  in  identifying SCAADL  recipients  that  have  returned  to  a  state  of  self-sufficiency.    The  RCC  and/or NMCM will notify the  Airman that the effective date of termination of their SCAADL, and  notify  AFPC/DPFW  immediately  to  avoid  an  overpayment  resulting  in  potential indebtedness to the government.  A new form and physician’s evaluation is not required to  terminate  SCAADL  when  the  Airman  is  no  longer  eligible  due  to  self-sufficiency   42  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 unless the Airman disputes the termination.  If the Airman disagrees with the termination he  or  she  should  request  a  new  evaluation.    This  evaluation  becomes  the  final determination as to whether SCAADL should be terminated or continued. 10.12.1.4.  The  last  day  of  the  month  preceding  the  month  during  which  the  Airman begins receiving compensation under the VA caregiver program. 10.12.2.  CMT  members  should  assist  potentially  qualified  Airmen  in  applying  for  the  VA Caregiver  Program  30  days  prior  to  separation  or  retirement  date  to  facilitate  an uninterrupted reception of benefits for the Airman. AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   43  Chapter 11 RECOVERING AIRMEN MENTORSHIP PROGRAM (RAMP) 11.1.  The  RAMP  exists  to:  Motivate  Airmen  by  helping them  develop  one-on-one relationships  with  peer  mentors  (fellow  Airmen  who  are  further  along  in  the  recovery  process) who  are  excellent  resources,  listeners,  and  "hospital  buddies"  who  motivate  through  their  own real life experiences. 11.2.  The  RAMP  provides:  An  avenue  for  the  Airman,  both  physically  injured  and/or  with PTSD  and  TBI,  to  connect  to  someone  with  experienced  in  what  they  are  experiencing;  these mentors have similar Air Force background and rank, age, gender, geographically area, hobbies, interests,  injury and/or recovery steps. 11.3.  AFPC/DPFW  will:  Provide training to all RAMP participants, both mentor and mentee.  RAMP  is  completely  voluntary  and  all  participants  are  bound  by  the  rules,  regulations, guidelines  and  instructions  applicable  to  the  RAMP  and  agree  to  participate  in  any  training required in order to effectively perform the mentorship service. 11.4.  The RAMP provides:  Each Airman a personal wingman they can reach out to and has a healing  effect  for  both  members.    It  provides  assistance  in  skill  building  and  participants  will have demonstrated a greater acceptance of their injury/illness, marked improvement in treatment timelines, higher personal  satisfaction, social  interaction  and coping mechanisms.   The Airmen involved gain the experience to be possible mentors for others beginning their recovery.   44  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 Chapter 12 ADAPTIVE SPORTS 12.1.  The  Air  Force  Adaptive  Sports  Program:  Motivates,  encourages  and  sustains participation and competition in adaptive and recreational sports and activities among the active or veteran wounded, injured, and ill Airmen of the US Air Force during their earliest stages of recovery. 12.2.  The  AF  Adaptive  Sports  program:  Provides  and  publicizes  community  based,  non-profit  and  AFW2  funded  rehabilitative  sports  opportunities  for  Airmen  to  participate  in rehabilitative  adaptive  sports  such  as  recumbent  cycling,  sitting  volleyball,  wheelchair basketball, archery/air rifle, swimming, track/ field events, and many other individual and  team sports.    The  program  also  encourages  participation  in  recreational  activities  such  as  hunting, fishing, boating and others adapted for those with physical and cognitive disabilities.  Airmen are encouraged to work with their CMT to reach their physical, psychological, social, and spiritual goals.  Events offered are based on location, objectives of the activity, and installation support.   Adaptive  sports  opportunities  should  be  introduced  during  the  earliest  stages  of  rehabilitation with the consent and approval of the Airman’s primary physician, PEBLO, and Commander. 12.3.  AFPC/DPFW will:  Schedule regional camps, joint competitions, and selection camps on an  annual  basis.    Scheduled  events  will  be  advertised  through  various  social  and  web-based media as soon as practical based on activity schedules and funding availability.  Schedules and events  are  subject  to  change  based  on  fiscal  adjustments,  installation  support,  and  changes  in competition dates/locations. (T-3) 12.4.  AFPC/DPFW  will  also:  Publicize  opportunities  organized  and  funded  by  other organizations  such  as  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs,  US  Paralympic  Sports  Clubs, Warfighter  Sports,  and  other  non-profit  community  groups.    These  activities,  although scrutinized,  are  not  endorsed  or  supported  by  the  Air  Force  in  any  manner  or  by  any  financial contribution.    Individuals  should  research  program  and  event  requirements  prior  to  signing  up.  Any  financial  obligations  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  individual  Airman  and  no  financial support in any form (travel, per diem, registration fees, etc.) will be provided by the Air Force. (T-3) 12.5.  Adaptive  Sports  events  are  a  unique  opportunity  for  participants.  The  team environment  adds  an  additional  layer  of  support  to  the  individual  care  network.    Airmen participating  in  adaptive  sports  camps  and  who  may  not  be  able  to  perform  one  or  more  basic daily living activities may require medical attendants or caregivers.  Caregivers and non-medical attendants (NMAs) are a vital piece of this care network.  The non-medical attendant or caregiver must  be  available  to  the  Airman  at  all  adaptive  sports  events  and  must  be  present  with  their Airman during all scheduled activities.  Caregiver services are to be focused on the Airman and cannot simultaneously care for children, guests, visitors or other athlete service animals. 12.6.  For  active  duty  Airmen:  Authorized  NMAs  must  be  in  receipt  of  SCAADL  pay;  for veterans, caregivers must be in receipt of the VA caregiver stipend.  Any Airman that requires a caregiver,  but  are  not  in  receipt  of  either  of  the  above  program  benefits,  should  contact AFPC/DPFW  with  a  request  for  a  caregiver  to  accompany  them.    Any  questions  regarding  the AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   45  eligibility  of  an  NMA  or  caregiver  should  be  directed  to  the  AFPC/DPFW  Adaptive  Sports Program Manager. 12.6.1.  PTSD/emotional support dogs will not be federally funded to attend adaptive sports events.  Airmen requiring service animals must ensure they provide home of record licensing requirements and tags designating this license. The service animal will meet the standards of certification and training as outlined by Assistance Dogs  International  and the  International Guide Dog Federation.  All service animals staying at hotels contracted by AFPC/DPFW or coming  onto  an  event  site  on  a  regular  basis  (e.g.,  excluding  occasional  visitors  or  guests) must be vaccinated against diseases common to that type of animal in accordance with state and  local  laws,  rules  and  regulations.  All  vaccinations  must  be  current  and  verifiable.  Airmen are legally responsible for the behavior or actions of their service animal.   46  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 Chapter 13 CAREER READINESS PROGRAMS 13.1.  This  chapter  establishes:  Air  Force  policy,  assigns  responsibility  and  provides procedures  to  manage  and  implement  the  Employment  and  Education  Initiative  (E2I)  and Operation Warfighter (OWF) programs in accordance with DoDI 1300.25, and Office of Warrior Care    standing  operating  procedures.    It  addresses  the  E2I,  OWF  and  VA’s  Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) Programs specific to Airmen.  It is not inclusive of all transition  programs  and  services.    Airmen  should  take  advantage  of  the  numerous  transition programs  such  as:    A&FRC  Transition  Assistance  Programs  (TAP),  Department  of  Labor Programs, and veterans services programs to be best prepared for their transition to civilian life. 13.1.1.  The E2I and OWF referral process differs for RCP enrollees and IDES Participants.  Airmen  will  be  referred  as  follows:  1)  Airmen  in  the  RCP  will  be  referred  to  their  RCC, NMCM  or  the  Career  Readiness  Cell  through  the  AFPC/DPFW  Program  and  2)  Airmen referred to IDES but not enrolled in the RCP will be referred by installation to the A&FRC’s TAP. 13.1.1.1.  The  PEBLO  refers  interested  IDES  personnel  who  are  not  seriously  ill  or injured (therefore not enrolled in the RCP) to the A&FRC for information on OWF and E2I. 13.2.  The  E2I  Program  is:  A  collaborative  effort,  led  by  DoD,  with  support  from  federal agencies  and  non-federal  entities  to  address  the  synchronization,  integration  and  possible expansion  of  existing  education  and  employment  support  efforts  for  Airmen  to  improve  career readiness and facilitate employment placements prior to separation. 13.2.1.  Airmen  enrolled  in  the  RCP  who  are  deemed  ready  to  participate  in  education  and employment  activities  will  be  referred  to  their  RCC  or  NMCM.    The  RCC  or  NMCM  will link  the  Airman  with  their  regional  E2I/OWF  coordinator  and  annotate  participation  in  the electronic case file.  Additionally, the RCC or NMCM will notify the Career Readiness Cell when  an  Airman  enrolls  in  E2I.    Regional  coordinators  will  work  with  the  Airman  to determine  education  requirements  for  desired  career  paths.  These  educational  requirements may include formal degree programs or training, certifications and licensing programs.  Once identified the  Airman’s  base A&FRCs/transition  offices, VA, and community  resources to  assist  the Airman in  attaining their goals.  Airmen may participate in E2I regardless of title status but may not participate in any federal internships unless in Title 10 status. coordinator  works together  with the regional 13.2.1.1.  By developing strategic partnerships with employers across different industries, the regional coordinators are better able to assist Airmen by identifying career matching opportunities with an industry partner that is the best fit. 13.3.  The OWF Program is:  A non-paid federal internship program for Airmen while still on active  duty.    The  objective  of  OWF  is  to  place  Airmen  in  a  supportive  work  environment  to assist  their  rehabilitation  and  potentially  increase  career  readiness  while  enabling  federal agencies to  better familiarize themselves with the skill sets and challenges of Airmen.  Airmen should understand this is a voluntary program with no guarantee of permanent employment.  The primary  purpose  of  the  program  is  wellness  in  the  recovery  process  and  to  positively  impact AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   47  transition and rehabilitation process.  The secondary purpose is exposure to civilian employment practices/opportunities.  No  duty  status  change  is  required  for  Airmen  participating  in  OWF internships;  the  Airman  remains  assigned  and  attached  to  their  unit  and  the  internship  site  is considered  an  alternate  work  location.    This  opportunity  may  be  terminated  with  or  without cause at any time by the Airman, host agency or the Airman’s chain of command. 13.3.1.  The  OWF  program  is  open  to  Airmen  who  are  enrolled  in  the  RCP  or  referred  to IDES.  Each Airman must be medically ready and command approved for participation, and their  internship  must  not  interfere  with  their  medical  profile  or  adversely  affect  their  well-being  or  recovery.    The  Airman’s  CMT  (to  include  the  Warrior  Care  Support  Career Readiness  Cell,  Airman’s  chain  of  command  and  medical  provider)  will  determine  if  the Airman  is  ready  to  participate  in  employment  activities  and  complete  the  appropriate application approval forms. 13.3.1.1.  The  medical  evaluation  must  conclude  the  Airman  is  medically,  emotionally, and physically ready to participate in an OWF internship and the internship will assist in the  Airman’s  rehabilitation.    The  medical  evaluation  must  include  a  functional assessment  which  clearly  defines  limitations  or  required  reasonable  accommodations which will be provided to the Airman in the event they need to work with OWF and/or the agency for reasonable accommodation purposes. 13.3.1.2.  The chain of command evaluation must conclude the Airman demonstrates the initiative  and  self-discipline  required  to  successfully  participate  in  an  OWF  internship.  The internship will not interfere with the Airman’s ability to attend medical appointments and allow time to complete IDES processing. 13.3.2.  OWF  Regional  Coordinators  provide  assistance  and  coordination  for  application, preparation, enrollment, continuance, and other administrative tasks for Airmen who wish to participate in OWF internships.  Internships are currently limited to Federal agencies and will range  in  duration  and  hours  per  week  based  on  employer  needs  and  Airman  availability.  They typically last 3 – 9 months and an average of 20 -30 hours per week.  The work hours and  duty  location  will  be  specified  as  part  of  the  placement  process  and  will  serve  as  the Airman’s place of duty unless otherwise excused by the chain of command.  If the Airman’s recovery does not progress as expected or if the internship interferes with Airman’s ability to attend medical appointments, delays progression through IDES, or will delay separation, the CMT can modify Airman participation appropriately. 13.3.2.1.  Follow-on  employment  is  not  a  guaranteed  outcome  of  the  OWF  program, although  after  transitioning  from  military  service,  the  Airmen  may  gain  full-time employment at the federal agency where he or she interned. 13.3.3.  OWF Roles and Responsibilities: 13.3.3.1.  Airmen  responsibilities  include  attending  all  medical  appointments,  lead  goal development  and  actively  participate  with  any  actions  plans  identified  in  care  and transition  plans.    They  must  complete  a  federal  resume,  which  aligns  with  long-term goals, and submit a copy of it to either the RCC or NMCM, depending on phase of care they are currently in.  Airmen will complete the DoD OWF application, collect required medical  and  CMT  signatures  before  submitting  it  to  either  their  RCC  or  NMCM  for further  processing.    If  accepted  into  the  program,  Airmen  must  communicate  regularly   48  AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015 with  their  host  agency  supervisor,  NMCM  and/or  CMT;  to  include  work  schedules, availability,  medical  appointments,  periods  of  leave,  military  obligations,  reasonable accommodations,  work  development  and  progress,  and  any  positive  or  negative issues/concerns regarding the worksite/duties.  They must perform agreed duties and the work  schedule  as  outlined  on  the  DoD  Placement  form;  observe  all  workplace  rules, including  those  relating  to  conduct,  safety,  honesty,  integrity,  and  confidentiality  of records. 13.3.3.2.  The Career Readiness Cell (AFPC/DPFWS) provides operational guidance and education to Airmen, CMTs (including chain of command), and external federal agencies for  RCP  participants.    They  review  OWF  application  packets  and  forward  to  OWF Coordinators when complete.  They coordinate Airman participation with OWF Regional Coordinators, RCCs and NMCMs.  They market OWF program opportunities to Airmen and their chain of command.  They also initiate CMS case requests to update or remove Functional  Accounting  Codes  (FACs)  upon  receipt  of  completed,  or  terminated  OWF work contracts (applicable for Airmen not assigned to patient squadrons). (T-3) 13.3.3.3.  RCCs/NMCMs  and  A&FRC  will  discuss  OWF  with  Airmen  during  the Rehabilitation  Phase  of  care.    They  will  assist  the  Airman  with  preparing  the  OWF application packet.  If needed, RCCs and NMCMs will refer the Airman to the A&FRC to  complete  or  review  the  Airman’s  federal  resume,  obtain  medical  clearance  and commander’s  approval  for  participation.    After  ensuring  the  Airman’s  application  is complete,  they  will  forward  it  to  the  Career  Readiness  Cell.  Lastly,  they  will  solicit monthly  feedback  from  Airmen  regarding  OWF  progress;  update  case  notes  and  notify Warrior Care Support Career Readiness Cell of issues or concerns. 13.3.3.4.  A&FRCs will ensure the widest dissemination of OWF program information by base-wide  marketing  of  emails,  posters,  flyers  and  handouts,  working  with  local leadership  to  grow  OWF  opportunities,  and  publicizing  OWF  participation/statistics provided  by  the  Career  Readiness  Cell.    They  will  provide  personalized  analysis  of  the Airmen  career  goals  and  develop  an  individual  development/transition  plan  to  ensure timeliness  of  OWF  participation  with  an  agency  matching  career  interests  and geographical  preferences.    Additionally,  they  will  help  the  Airman  complete  a  federal resume in the USAJobs format, reflective of desired career field skill sets. 13.3.3.5.  Commanders  may  allow  participation  unless  it  would  pose  a  significant negative impact on unit mission accomplishment.  When approving an application, they are  confirming  the  Airman  demonstrates  the  initiative  and  self-discipline  required  to successfully participate in an OWF internship.  The final decision to allow participation rests with the unit Commander. 13.3.3.6.  Where appropriate, Occupational  Therapy  will collaborate with  the PCM, PT, and  any  other  clinical  staff  upon  Airman  acceptance.    Additionally,  they  will  provide guidance  to  the  Readiness  Cell  staff  regarding  medical  readiness  to  participate  in  the DoD OWF.  They will conduct initial and functional assessments in coordination with the CMT,  conduct  worksite  assessments  to  determine  limits  of  the  Airman’s  profile,  and ensure  CRP  goals  and  career  track  are  in  line  with  the  potential  internship  opportunity.  Additionally,  they  will  serve  as  the  SME  for  Computer/Electronic  Accommodations Program (CAP) and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) reasonable accommodations. AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   49  13.4.  Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) 13.4.1.  The  Air  Force’s  intent  is  to  provide  access  to  VR&E  services  at  the  earliest opportunity  to  all  Airmen  (including  National  Guard  and  Reserve  Airmen  on  active  duty orders).

If the Airman is self-employed they must  provide  a  statement  from  the  physician  that  their  inability  to  perform  their  self-employment  functions  are  a  direct  result  of  the  injury,  illness  or  disease  identified  in  the LOD.    The  Airman  must  provide  a  statement  from  their  civilian  employer  identifying  the AFI34-1101  6 MAY 2015   51  amount of gross earnings lost and any income from sick leave.  If the Airman is deemed unfit for duty, the civilian employer must certify whether the Airman can perform full or limited duties in their civilian job. 14.2.4.  An  extension  request  beyond  6  months  should  be  initiated  by  the  Airman  at  the  4-month mark if the expected recovery period extends past the initial 6 months.

This includes either giving them the same transitional program guidance/support  provided  on  active  duty  installations,  or  if  unable  to  do  so  locally  making arrangements  with  the  Airman’s  unit  to  send  the  Airman  to  the  closest  supporting  active  duty A&FRC,  even  if  that  entails  the  unit  paying  for  temporary  duty  travel/lodging/per  diem  for week-long TAP, pre-separation and Survivor Benefit Program counseling if applicable. 14.3.1.  The  Airman’s  unit  should  be  supporting  their  Airman’s  transition  into  the  civilian community to the largest extent possible.  This includes providing necessary encouragement and  cutting  through  red  tape  to  make  sure  their  Airman  receives  the  highest  quality  of transitional  counseling  and  support.    Units  have  an  obligation  to  fund  TDY  travel  when necessary to the closest active duty installation to participate in their TAP, Survivor Benefit Counseling or other transitioning/outprocessing requirements.
