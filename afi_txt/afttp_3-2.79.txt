This document—   Outlines the HRF command and control (C2) and working relationships within the broader context of National Guard CERFP/HRF operations.   Outlines  the  structure,  element  composition,  capabilities,  and  planning  considerations  of  the CERFP/HRF.   Delineates  the  C2  relationship  of  the  CERFP/HRF  and  the  relationships  to  the  joint  force headquarters (JFHQ)–state and other potential higher headquarters.   Discusses sustainment and support requirements for CERFP/HRF operations.   Establishes baseline operational configurations and processes for the CERFP/HRF in response to a Tier 2 or Tier 3 support request. The potential for terrorist activities directed against U.S. citizens and interests worldwide is a serious threat. To counter this threat, the U.S. government has implemented a number of measures to enhance the ability of the nation to prepare for, respond to, and recover from terrorist activities within the United States, its territories, and its possessions (federal, state, local, and tribal). The CERFPs/HRFs are task forces that were developed by the leadership of the National Guard Bureau and various states as measures implemented to support response to the threat  against  the  homeland.  While  primarily  designed  for  use  at  a  chemical,  biological,  radiological,  and nuclear (CBRN) incident site, CERFPs/HRFs are also available for use in natural or man-made disasters (all hazards). The primary audience for ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 is the middle and senior leadership of the Army and Air Force (officers in the rank of major and above who command National Guard forces in major operations and campaigns or serve on the staffs that support those commanders). It is also applicable to the enlisted and civilian leadership of the Army and Air Force. Commanders,  staffs,  and  subordinates  ensure  that  their  decisions  and  actions  comply  with  applicable  U.S., international, and (in some cases) host nation laws and regulations. Commanders at all levels ensure that their Soldiers operate according to the law of war and the rules of engagement. (See Field Manual [FM] 27-10.) The CERFP and HRF can be prepositioned or respond to an incident using existing organic transportation and Army National Guard (ARNG)/Air National Guard (ANG) units in state active duty  status or Title 32, U.S. Code  (32  USC)  status.  These  units  are  trained  and  equipped  to  integrate  under  the  National  Incident Management  System  to  support  the  incident  commander.  The  CERFP  supports  the  incident  commander  by planning  and  exercising  C2,  casualty  search  and  extraction  in  support  of  urban  search  and  rescue  tasks, ambulatory  and  nonambulatory  mass  casualty  decontamination,  emergency  medical  triage  and  patient stabilization,  and  fatality  search  and  recovery.  The  HRF  provides  support  to  the  incident  commander  by planning and conducting C2, security operations, and CERFP operations (when the CERFP is attached). This  document  consolidates  multiple  sources  and  descriptions  of  the  CERFP/HRF.  It  integrates  the  various historical  CERFP/HRF  validated  concepts  and  guidance  with  the  best  practices  gleaned  from  subject  matter experts in the different operational areas of the currently fielded CERFP/HRF. This information is shared with key decisionmakers at local, state, and federal levels.   iv ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Preface   Notes.   1.  The  fatality  search  and  recovery  teams  and  religious  support  teams  are  not  currently  assigned  to CERFPs/HRFs  on  a  permanent  basis.  The  fatality  search  and  recovery  teams  are  an  additional capability  that  can be  requested, when needed,  to  support  the  CERFPs/HRFs by  conducting  fatality search and recovery operations, while the religious support teams are an additional capability that can provide  religious  support  during  an  incident.  (See  appendix  A  for  more  information  on  the  fatality search and recovery team, and see appendix B for more information on the religious support team.) 2.  When  addressing  the  CERFP/HRF,  this  manual  will  address  the  units  according  to  the  order  of incident response.  3. The CERFP and the HRF do not have an explosive ordnance capability assigned to them. CBRN incident  site  requests  for  explosive  ordnance  disposal  or  public  safety  bomb  capability  are  to  be forwarded through the incident commander to the joint task force (JTF)–state or JFHQ-state.

The defense of the homeland in the United States and territories is the top priority of the nation and the DOD. Throughout the history of the United States, the National Guard has responded to and defended our nation against all enemies—foreign and domestic. The Preamble to the Constitution indicates that the federal government will “provide for the common defense” of the homeland and interests abroad. The Constitution and the history and heritage of the United States have  always  given  the  National  Guard  a  role  in  national  defense.  The  terrorism incidents  on  11  September  2001  resulted  in  a  new  urgency  to  this  mission. Today, governors rely on the National Guard to respond to emergencies and disasters when other  local  and  state  capabilities  are  overwhelmed  or  when  specific  technical assistance  is  needed.  The  National  Guard  and  other  DOD  forces  also  protect  and defend critical national infrastructure and resources that are important to our way of life  as  Americans.  This  chapter  discusses  the  history  of  homeland  security  and homeland  defense,  the  state  and  federal  dual  mission,  National  Guard  response elements,  and  state  and  federal  support.  Other  national  and  DOD  CBRN  response capabilities are also discussed in this chapter. HOMELAND DEFENSE, HOMELAND SECURITY, AND DSCA 1-1.  The  homeland  as  defined  in  Joint  Publication  (JP)  1-02  is  the  physical  region  that  includes  the continental  United  States,  Alaska,  Hawaii,  United  States  possessions  and  territories,  and  surrounding territorial waters and airspace. The evolving threats to the homeland, along with the requirements of the Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) mission, demand that the National Guard continue to develop response capabilities that address CBRN threats and hazards. This includes threats to critical infrastructure (private and government) that could affect governance; transportation; energy distribution; production of goods; and availability of services, food, commerce, and communications. 1-2.  In  the  homeland,  DOD  conducts  homeland  defense  and  DSCA—DOD  missions  that  support  the national homeland security enterprise led by the President and the Department of Homeland Security. The DOD  must  be  capable  of  conducting  homeland  defense  and  DSCA  operations  while  simultaneously conducting other operations in support of preventing conflicts. 1-3.  DSCA  is  support  that  is  provided  by  the  U.S.  military,  DOD  civilians,  DOD  contract  personnel, DOD component assets, and National Guard forces (when the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the governors of the affected states, elects and requests to use those forces in 32 U.S.C. status) in response to requests for assistance from civil authorities for domestic emergencies, law enforcement support, and other domestic activities or from qualifying entities for special events (JP 1-02). 1-4.  Federal, state, local, and tribal governments recognize and monitor the planning for, the response to, and  recovery  from  CBRN  attacks.  The  Defense  Planning  Guidance,  fiscal  years  04–09,  stated  that  the “United States is facing an increasingly dynamic strategic environment that includes ruthless, resourceful, and  highly  adaptive  potential  adversaries  able  to  employ  asymmetric  capabilities.  These  adversaries  are likely  to  exploit  increasingly  powerful  means  of  destruction…  [and  are]  investing  in  advanced  military technologies,  such  as  CBRN  weapons,  and  ballistic  or  cruise  missiles  and  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  to 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 1-1 Chapter 1  deliver  them.  There  are  also  indications  that  potential  adversaries  are  developing  novel,  asymmetrical operational concepts for employing these advanced technologies.” 1-5.  The  September  2002  National  Security  Strategy  of  the  United  States  of  America  established  the precept,  “Minimizing  the  effects  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction  use  against  our  people  will  help  deter those who possess such weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends.” The 2002 National Military Strategy of the United States of America goes  on  to  read,  “…  of  special  concern  are  terrorism,  the  use  or  threatened  use  of  weapons  of  mass destruction,  and  information  warfare.  These  three  risks  in  particular  have  the  potential  to  threaten  the homeland and the population directly…. U.S. Armed Forces as a whole should be multi-mission capable; interoperable among all elements… and able to coordinate operations with other agencies of government and some civil institutions.” 1-6.  On  30  July  2003,  the  Secretary  of  Defense  issued  a  memorandum  for  the  Chief,  National  Guard Bureau, on guard bureau initiatives that specifically states, “… strive to adapt the National Guard Bureau to better  support  the  [Global  War  on  Terrorism],  homeland  defense  and  homeland  security.  Seek  ways  to strengthen  National  Guard  Bureau’s  relationship  with  the  Joint  Staff,  U.S.  Northern  Command,  United States Pacific Command, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense–Homeland Defense. My intent is to enhance our ability to employ forces to meet the nation’s homeland defense needs.” 1-7.  During  March  2004,  the  U.S.  Northern  Command  commander  signed  a  memorandum  for  the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff that says, “We support the National Guard Bureau’s initiative to institute National  Guard  Bureau  CERFP  task  forces  regionally  throughout  the  United  States.  This  plan  would provide trained and ready units to locate, extract, and decontaminate casualties, as well as perform medical triage and emergency treatment.” (See appendix C for more information on the medical element.) 1-8.  The  September  2006  National  Strategy  for  Combating  Terrorism  recognizes  CBRN  incident response  as  one  of  the  six  objects  of  addressing  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  It  states,  “Once  the possibility of a weapons of mass destruction attack against the United States has been detected, we will seek  to  contain,  interdict,  and  eliminate  the  threat.  We  will  continue  to  develop  requisite  capabilities  to eliminate the possibility of a weapons of mass destruction operation and to prevent a possible follow-on attack.  We  will  prepare  ourselves  for  possible  weapons  of  mass  destruction  incidents  by  developing capabilities to manage the range of consequences that may result from such an attack against the United States or our interests around the world.” 1-9.  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, federal and state officials struggled with fatality recovery. At one point, the DOD took over fatality search and recovery operations. Also in 2005, an Air Force agile civil support  risk  assessment  and  review  of  the  Air  Force  CBRN  master  plan  indentified  a  mortuary  affairs shortfall  in  response  to  a  contingency  CBRN  incident,  while  a  review  called  for  capabilities  to  provide CBRN consequence management in support of civil authorities. The Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel partnered with the National Guard Bureau Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel to develop search and recovery teams that could respond specifically to a CBRN mass fatality incident. The ANG took the lead and established ten fatality search and recovery teams by converting existing unit type codes. In 2008, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau identified a gap in fatality management within the National Guard CERFP capability, leading to the alignment of 17 fatality search and recovery teams composed of ANG personnel (3 military occupational specialties) trained in search and recovery. This capability was identified as a potential complement to National Guard Bureau CERFP teams. These teams, once trained, comprise the fatality search and recovery team of the CERFP. 1-10.  Paragraph 4.1 of Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 2000.18 states, “The DOD components in the continental United States have the responsibility, as specified in U.S. law, to support and assist U.S. civil authorities, as directed, in consequence management activities for natural and man-made disasters, to include CBRN-related incidents on U.S. territory.” 1-11.  Within  the  2010  Quadrennial  Defense  Review  Report,  the  Secretary  of  Defense  directed  DOD  to “Field  faster,  more  flexible  consequence  management  response  forces”  by  restructuring  chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) consequence management response force and standing up ten National Guard HRFs. The Secretary of Defense directive in the report resulted in 1-2 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Operations in Support of the Homeland  the establishment of a DOD CBRN response enterprise consequence management that has the following major components:   DOD CBRN consequence management forces composed of National Guard civil support teams, CERFPs, and HRFs under the command authority of the governor of the supported states.   DOD federal forces under the command of U.S. Northern Command or U.S. Pacific Command in  direct  support  to  the  lead  federal  agency.  HRFs  are  assigned  to  each  Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) region and provide C2, a CBRN assistance support element, and a CBRNE task force in support of a CBRNE incident. 1-12.  Homeland security and homeland defense are complementary components of the National Security Strategy. Homeland security is the concerted national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States;  it  reduces  America’s  vulnerability  to  terrorism,  major  disasters,  and  other  emergencies  and minimizes the damage and recovery from attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies that occur (JP 3-28).  Homeland  defense  is  the  protection  of  U.S.  sovereignty,  territory,  domestic  population,  and  critical defense infrastructure against external threats and aggression or other threats as directed by the President (JP 3-27). Missions are defined as homeland defense if the nation is under concerted attack from a foreign enemy. The DOD leads homeland defense and is supported by other federal agencies. The DOD supports the nation’s homeland security effort, which is led by the Department of Homeland Security. A review of the  relationship  between  homeland  defense,  homeland  security,  and  DSCA  is  located  in  JP  3-28.  This publication focuses primarily on the aspects associated with homeland security, DSCA, and National Guard civil support. 1-13.  The employment of military forces to conduct operations within the homeland is constrained by laws and  policies.  This  unique  environment  must  be  understood  by  commanders  before  an  event  to  shape activities  before  and  during  execution.  The  National  Guard  plays  a  predominant  and  unique  role  in homeland  defense  and  DSCA  operations,  whether  under  the  mission  command  of  the  state  governor  or federalized in 10 USC status under the mission command of the President of the United States, Secretary of Defense, and supported combatant commander. A unity of effort between state- and federal-led responses is required for operating in the homeland. NATIONAL GUARD DUAL STATE AND FEDERAL MISSIONS 1-14.  State National Guard forces are commanded or directed by their respective governors, but they can be mobilized federally on the order of the president. In each support role, the National Guard has a specific chain of command. The governor commands or directs the National Guard when performing training or duty in state active duty or under 32 USC. In 10 USC status, the National Guard is a federal military asset under  the  control  of  the  President  and  may  be  assigned  to  support  any  combatant  commander.  The CERFPs/HRFs  may  be  deployed  in  state  active  duty,  32  USC,  or  10  USC  authority.  When  operating outside its state, CERFP/HRF will be under the authorities and agreements of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), memorandums of agreement and/or memorandums of understanding. 1-15.  When federal military and National Guard forces are employed simultaneously in support of civil authorities in the United States, the designation of a dual-status commander is the usual C2 arrangement. When a CERFP or HRF is operating on state active duty or 32 USC status under a dual-status commander, C2 is maintained through state authorities. The 10 USC status CBRN response enterprise forces under dual-status commanders are maintained through federal authorities. The dual-status commander serves as a link between two distinct and separate chains of command (federal and state) to facilitate a unity of effort. 1-16.  The CERFP/HRF assignment is a dual mission assigned to the ARNG modified table of organization and  equipment  and  ANG  manning  document  units.  Units  that  have  assigned  CERFP/HRF  tasks  also continue to perform their assigned primary mission. The mission and tasks related to supporting a response to a CBRN incident are often an additional skill set above and beyond their primary military occupational specialty/Air Force specialty code skills. They must maintain proficiency in both sets of tasks. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 1-3 Chapter 1  EMERGENCY RESPONSE CRITERIA FOR EMPLOYMENT 1-17.  HRFs are designed to respond to major CBRN incidents and fill the gap between state and federal response  teams.  Criteria  for response  are determined  by respective governors  or  the  President.  Requests must be validated mission assignments. 1-18.  The National Guard CBRN response enterprise (civil support teams, CERFPs, and HRFs) comprises a significant portion of the total DOD life-saving capability to mitigate the impact of domestic major or catastrophic CBRN events. The National Guard CBRN response enterprise is part of a larger DOD national response capability, and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau will synchronize the deployment of the National  Guard  response  enterprise  with  supporting/supported  JFHQ-states,  Office  of  the  Secretary  of Defense, and the joint staff. 1-19.  Requests for National Guard support can be received from the state and federal agencies specified in the emergency management plans. The processes for requesting and validating requests for assistance must be clearly delineated and understood. 1-20.  During suspected or known CBRN events, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau coordinates with the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Americas’ Security Affairs and joint staff  provost  marshal  division  (J-34)  to  obtain  Secretary  of  Defense  approval  of  the  employment  of  the National Guard CBRN response enterprise in T-32 and the overall level of response (total number of civil support teams, HRFs, and CERFPs) that will be alerted and deployed. During suspected or known CBRN events, it is expected that the civil support teams, HRFs, and CERFPs within the affected FEMA region will alert and deploy initially in state active duty. 1-21.  State  and  regional  requests  for  assistance  are  validated  through  established  JFHQ-state  and/or incident  command  system  emergency  response  channels.  Requests  for  assistance  normally  follow established  emergency  management  procedures  in  which  local  officials  contact  the  state  emergency management agency. The authority to alert and deploy the National Guard in state active duty, including the CERFP/HRF, rests with the governor (through the adjutant general). If the CERFP/HRF is to operate under  10  USC  authority,  the  defense  coordinating  officer  or  other  designated  representative  of  the combatant commander makes this validation. If a request for CERFP/HRF is received, the National Guard Coordination  Center  identifies  available  assets  to  satisfy  the  request  and  notifies  the  JFHQ-state  of  the appropriate state to activate the forces in 10 USC authority following Secretary of Defense approval. The National Guard Coordination Center coordinates the activation and deployment of requested forces with the state and the requesting combatant commander. 1-22.  In the absence of a validated mission assignment, commanders and other officials may still employ CERFPs/HRFs  for  immediate  response  activities  to  save  lives,  prevent  human  suffering,  or  mitigate property damage. For forces in 10 USC status, DODD 3015.18 provides that, upon a request for assistance from a civil authority, under imminently serious conditions and if time does not permit approval from a higher authority, federal military commanders and certain other DOD officials may provide an immediate response by temporarily employing the resources under their control to save lives, prevent human suffering, or  mitigate  property  damage  within  the  United  States.  However,  these  federal  forces  may  not  subject civilians to military power that is “regulatory, prescriptive, proscriptive, or compulsory.” 1-23.  Department of Defense Directive (DODD) 3025.18 also recognizes the authority of state officials to direct a state immediate response using National Guard personnel under state C2, including personnel in 32 USC status, according to state law. However, National Guard personnel may not be placed in or extended in 32 USC status to conduct state immediate-response activities. 1-24.  Immediate-response  authority  is  defined  as  the  temporary  authority  of  a  DOD  official  to  employ resources under their control (subject to any supplemental direction provided by higher headquarters) and to  provide  those  resources  to  save  lives,  prevent  human  suffering,  or  mitigate  great  property  damage  in response to a request for assistance from a civil authority, under imminently serious conditions when time does not permit approval from a higher authority with the United States. Immediate-response authority does not permit actions that would subject civilians to the use of military power that is regulatory, prescriptive, proscriptive, or compulsory. 1-4 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Operations in Support of the Homeland  1-25.  The  authority  of  state  officials  is  recognized  to  direct  a  state  immediate  response  using  National Guard personnel under state C2 (including personnel in 32 USC status) according to state law, but National Guard  personnel  may  not  be  placed  or  extended  in  32  USC  status  to  conduct  state  immediate-response activities. 1-26.  Governors may use units and other elements of the HRF for an all-hazards response as required, but the designation of HRF is used within the HRF construct (such as a CBRN event).  CERFP WITHIN THE INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM 1-27.  The CERFP integration into the incident command system at a CBRN incident is essential to ensure coordinated  planning  and  information  sharing.  The  fundamental  incident  command  system  structure remains  the  same  for  all  incidents,  allowing  for  an  incident  command  with  four  sections  (operations, logistics, planning, and finance). During large-scale operations, the CERFP can be assigned as a branch within  the  operations  section.  As  a  branch  organization,  specific  responsibilities  assigned  to  individual CERFP elements could be established as group functions. In smaller scale incidents, responsibilities and tasks could be assigned within a group or sector of operations. HRF WITHIN THE INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM 1-28.  The HRF generally operates in direct support of the JTF-state commander and directly coordinates within the incident command system, taking assignments from the JTF-state commander in support of, and coordination with, the incident commander responsible for the CBRN incident response. The integration into the incident command system at a CBRN incident is essential for the HRF to maximize the capabilities and efficiencies of CBRN response forces. Because the HRF normally deploys for catastrophic events, the HRF  liaise  with  and  support  the  larger unified  command  structure.  The  assignment  and  structure of the incident command system is situation-driven. The fundamental incident command system structure remains the  same  for  all  incidents,  allowing  for  an  incident  command  with  four  sections  (operations,  logistics, planning,  and  finance).  During  large-scale  operations,  the  HRF  can  be  assigned  as  a  branch  within  the operations section. As a branch organization, specific responsibilities assigned to individual HRF elements could  be  established  as  group  functions.  In  smaller-scale  incidents,  responsibilities  and  tasks  could  be assigned within a group or sector of operations. If the HRF C2 element is not deployed, the CERFP C2 element  would  assume  this  mission.  The  CERFP  C2  element  would  coordinate  liaison  with  higher headquarters and supported elements. 1-29.  All  incident  command  system  activities  are  compliant  with  the  National  Incident  Management System  because  it  provides  a  systematic,  proactive  approach  to  guide  departments  and  agencies  at governmental, nongovernmental, and private sector levels to work seamlessly to prevent, protect against, respond  to,  recover  from,  and  mitigate  the  effects  of  incidents,  regardless  of  cause,  size,  location,  or complexity  to  reduce  the  loss  of  life,  property,  and  harm  to  the  environment.  The  National  Incident Management  System  works  hand  in  hand  with  the  National  Response  Framework  and  provides  the template  for  incident  management,  while  the  National  Response  Framework  provides  the  structure  and mechanisms for the national level policy for incident management. STATE-TO-STATE AGREEMENTS 1-30.  The  EMAC  is  a  federal  legislative  ratified  agreement  between  the  states  that  provides  form  and structure to interstate mutual aid. EMAC legislation was approved by Congress in 1996 as Public Law (PL) 104-321. The EMAC applies to National Guard personnel in state active duty or 32 USC authority, but not in 10 USC authority. 1-31.  The CERFP/HRF may be deployed across state boundaries in state active duty or 32 USC authority based on verbal or written agreements between affected governors without enacting the EMAC. States are encouraged to  develop  specific  state-to-state  compacts,  memorandums  of  understanding,  and memorandums of agreement outside the EMAC to facilitate regional CERFP/HRF support and response. Establishing  habitual  supporting  relationships  permits  advanced  and  detailed  planning  and  preparation, 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 1-5 Chapter 1  facilitating a more effective response. These agreements may be established through long-range planning and negotiation. 1-32.  As the states establish compacts, memorandums of understanding, and memorandums of agreement, many  key  issues  can  be  addressed.  The  CERFP/HRF  C2  is  conducted  according  to  provisions  of  the EMAC, memorandum of understanding, and memorandum of agreement and the applicable operation plan or  operation  order.  Other  key  issues  addressed  in  the  operation  plan  or  operation  order  include CERFP/HRF sustainment requirements and the reimbursement of expenses. 1-33.  In  the  absence  of  formal  or  informal  agreements,  the  governor  of  an  affected  state  may  request assistance through the joint information exchange environment for the deployment of CERFP/HRF. When a CERFP/HRF is requested from another state, the supported and supporting states must notify the National Guard Coordination Center of their actions. It is important for states without a CERFP/HRF to understand the capability and support requirements of a CERFP/HRF. FEDERAL SUPPORT 1-34.  The federal government and its agencies are asked to provide additional assistance when state and local response forces have exceeded or exhausted their capabilities due to the magnitude of the situation or the requirement for specific technical capabilities. 1-35.  The National Response Framework describes the processes used to provide this support to state and local  agencies.  The  National  Response  Framework  establishes  a  principal  federal  officer  whose responsibilities  include  conducting  an  initial  situation  assessment,  developing  an  action  plan  for  federal response,  and  monitoring  actions  and  activities  of  interagency  responders.  The  principal  federal  officer ensures that incident management efforts are maximized through effective and efficient coordination. For emergencies  declared  under  Public  Law  92-288  (commonly  known  as  the  Stafford  Act),  the  federal coordinating officer serves as the primary federal coordinator for disaster response and recovery while the state coordinating officer represents the state. 1-36.  The  defense  coordinating  element,  lead  by  the  defense  coordinating  officer,  consists  of  DOD operations  and  liaison  personnel,  including  state  emergency  preparedness  liaison  officers  that  regularly work with adjutant generals and the JFHQ-state operations directorate of a joint staff (J-3) or the director of military  support,  formerly  the  plans,  operations,  and  military  support  officer.  The  defense  coordinating officer  is  the  DOD  on-site  representative  who  coordinates  federal  military  support  to  civilian  agencies through the principal federal officer and emergency support functions leaders at the joint field office. 1-37.  The  unified  combatant  commands  maintain  a  network  of  federal  emergency  preparedness  liaison officers assigned in each state and federal region from the various services. They also designate a defense coordinating officer for each region and, as needed, a state coordinating officer for each state. Although assigned  to  their  regional  planning  authority,  emergency  preparedness  liaison  officers  routinely  work closely with the adjutant general to support state emergency management. These officers help coordinate mutual  support  between  the  Services,  the  unified  combatant  command,  and  their  assigned  state.  They facilitate 10 USC military support for the principal federal officer within the state and are knowledgeable of available military assets and state requirements. 1-38.  The  U.S.  Northern  Command  also  operates  a  standing  joint  forces  land  component,  U.S.  Army North. U.S. Army North subordinate command, JTF–civil support has the mission to save lives, prevent injury, and provide critical life support during a CBRN response in the United States and its territories and possessions. JTF-civil support headquarters is composed of military and supporting civilian personnel and has the capability to provide C2 of DOD 10 USC forces deployed to a CBRN incident site. NATIONAL GUARD BUREAU SUPPORT 1-39.  The Chief, National Guard Bureau, is a principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense through the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff on matters involving nonfederalized National Guard forces and through other DOD officials as outlined in DODD 5105.77, the National Guard Bureau, or as determined by the Secretary of Defense. For more information on the roles and responsibilities of the Chief, National Guard Bureau, see DODD 5105.77 or Army Regulation (AR) 130-5. 1-6 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Operations in Support of the Homeland  1-40.  The  National  Guard  Bureau  is  the  channel  of  communications  for  matters  between  the  National Guard  and  the  DA,  the  Department  of  the  Air  Force,  and  several  states.  In  addition  to  the  other  roles outlined in DODD 5105.77, the Chief, National Guard Bureau—   Prescribes the training discipline and training requirements for the ARNG and the ANG and the allocation of federal funds for the training of the ARNG and ANG.   Ensures that units and members of the ARNG and the ANG are trained by the states according to the approved policies and programs of the secretaries of the Army and Air Force.   Participates in global force management, force employment, and force reset matters concerning domestic homeland defense and DSCA and other matters impacting National Guard forces when under command of their governors.   Administers, consistent with the polices of the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joint programs and functions as necessary to effectively integrate National Guard resources and capabilities into DOD joint functions. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 1-41.  The National Guard Bureau National Guard Coordination Center consolidates information from the state  National  Guard  joint  operations  centers  to  maintain  situational  awareness  of  the  response  and operations in support of the state according to the National Response Framework and the National Incident Management  System.  The  National  Guard  Coordination  Center,  as  directed,  distributes  the  consolidated assessments  and  activities  of  the  National  Guard  employed  by  the  states  to  the  Assistant  Secretary  of Defense  for  Homeland  Defense,  U.S.  Northern  Command,  U.S.  Pacific  Command,  U.S.  Army  Forces Command,  U.S.  Army  North,  the  Air  Force  Office  of  Homeland  Operations,  and  the  Air  Force  North National  Security  Emergency  Preparedness  office  who  currently  dispatch  and  employ  federal  forces  to support  validated  defense  coordinating  officer  requirements.  This  communication  helps  preclude  many direct queries of response forces from diverse federal and state agencies.  INFORMATION MANAGEMENT 1-42.  The DSCA missions require that DOD CBRN organizations communicate and share information and data  analyses  with  state  incident  command  system  responders  and  partners.  The  National  Incident Management  System  and  supporting  guidelines  establish  the  basic  requirements  and  standards  for information sharing in the domestic, nonhomeland defense environment. See AR 25-2 for more information on information management. 1-43.  The Chief, National Guard Bureau, has initiated aggressive action to streamline the organizational structure, processes, and analytical capabilities at the National Guard Bureau and at each of the JFHQ in the states, territories, and the District of Columbia to effectively respond to homeland defense and homeland security requirements. Key components of this strategy are to provide—   Continuous  and  accurate  situational  awareness  of  National  Guard  operational  capabilities  and activities  at  state  and/or  territory  and  incident  levels  and  enhanced  vertical  and  horizontal information sharing and collaboration capabilities to facilitate mission planning and resourcing.   Fully  integrated,  trusted  information  sharing  and  a  collaboration  environment  supporting  the National Guard, combatant commanders, and key interagency homeland defense and homeland security stakeholders. Note. The purpose of this strategy is to facilitate and promote a unity of effort. COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORK SYSTEMS 1-44.  CERFP/HRF  communications  should  be  interoperable  with  incident  command  system  responders and partners, capable of supporting voice, data, and video according to supported local incident command standards  to  effectively  contribute  to  unified  actions.  CERFP/HRF  communications  and  information technology  network  systems  facilitate  the  centralized  planning  and  coordinated  employment  of  casualty search,  medical  triage,  mass  decontamination,  casualty  assistance,  and  force  protection  forces  and 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 1-7 Chapter 1  capabilities. HRFs/CERFPs include communications and information technology systems that are to plan and manage the phasing of the commander and incident commander’s critical information requirements; process  mission  reports;  distribute  information,  data,  and  reports;  and  facilitate  information  sharing  that leads to decisions among partners that ensure the synchronization of responder efforts in a dynamic civil support environment. (See appendix D for more information on the decontamination element.) 1-45.  Standard  military frequency frequency/very  high communications  systems  are  the  primary  means  of  DOD  support  for  civil  support/consequence management  domestic  operations.  CERFP/HRF  communications  must  be  interoperable  with  incident command  system  responders  and  partners,  capable  of  supporting  voice,  data,  and  video  according  to supported local incident command standards to most effectively contribute to unified actions. Planning and exercising the integration of spectrum resource allocation with federal, state, tribal, and local responders is also important for the synchronization of responder planning. communications,  ultra-high satellite TRANSITION TO TITLE 10, U.S. CODE STATUS 1-46.  The CERFP/HRF employment varies from mission to mission. During the course of a response, a CERFP/HRF  may  transition  from  state  active  duty  or  32  USC  to  10  USC  status.  The  CERFP/HRF  C2 should be cognizant of multiple factors to effectively continue operations. These factors include—   Military justice authority. The CERFP/HRF personnel in state active duty or 32 USC status are subject to state military justice authorities. Those serving under 10 USC status are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.   10 USC logistics support. The CERFP/HRF receives logistics support from DOD resources, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the incident command system.   10  USC  support.  The  CERFP/HRF  becomes  a  DOD  asset.  They  receive  guidance  from  a military headquarters identified in an applicable operation order. 1-47.  While operating in 10 USC status, other functional areas may also be impacted. These could include administrative  support,  work  priorities,  rules  for  the  use  of  force,  and  medical  support.  The  Posse Commitatus Act applies to the CERFP/HRF under 10 USC status authority within the United States. When anticipating federal activation, CERFP/HRF C2 elements consult the assigned judge advocate regarding the ramifications  of  transitioning  from  state  active  duty  or  32  USC  to  10  USC  status  under  the  specific authority anticipated. 1-48.  The transition from state active duty or 10 USC status to 32 USC status involves—   Duty release. The command reverts to the state upon release from duty under 10 USC status.   Mission completion. Upon mission completion and the release of control by the military on-scene  commander,  the  CERFP/HRF  immediately  contacts  the  higher  command  for  further guidance and instruction. In most cases, the CERFP/HRF is ordered to redeploy.   Redeployment.  The  CERFP/HRF  returns  to  the  home  station  and  conducts  post  operation activities when ordered to redeploy.   National  Guard  civil  support.  The  National  Guard  civil  support  is  support  provided  by  the National  Guard  of  the  several  states  while  in  state  active  duty  or  32  USC  status  to  civil authorities and for designated law enforcement activities. 1-49.  The  National  Guard  duty  authorities  are  state  active  duty,  32  USC,  or  10  USC  status.  These authorities determine the restrictions under which National Guard forces operate as discussed in chapter 2. Figure 1-1 provides a comparison of National Guard civil support and DSCA.

This  specialized  training  and  task  organizing  of  existing  forces  ensures  that  the National  Guard  is  ready  to  conduct  lifesaving  operations  in  contaminated  and/or collapsed  structure-confined  space  environments.  Specifically,  HRFs/CERFPs provide support to the incident command system for casualty search and extraction; emergency  medical  triage,  treatment,  and  patient  stabilization;  and  mass  casualty decontamination.  This  chapter  outlines the  mission  and  organization  of HRFs/CERFPs.  CERFP OVERVIEW 2-1.  The  CERFP  is  composed  of  traditional  National  Guard  units  that  are  task-organized  to  provide specialized CBRN consequence management capabilities to local, state, and federal authorities. These task forces receive additional special training and equipment to plan and conduct casualty search and extraction; emergency medical triage, treatment, and patient stabilization; mass casualty decontamination; and fatality search and recovery operations in support of the incident command system. These tasks are in addition to the primary military occupational specialty or Air Force specialty code, and proficiency is maintained in both. Units assigned to the CERFP continue to perform their assigned primary mission. The training and tailoring  of  existing  National  Guard  forces  into  specific  CBRN  response  organizations  ensures preparedness, response, and flexibility for the mission. When requested, the CERFP responds to an incident of state or national level significance to provide the C2 and capabilities to support the incident action plan objectives. Security is also required to provide cordon and entry control point support, law enforcement-related  duties,  and  other  mission-related  duties  as  manpower  allows  for  supporting  additional  mission requirements. Security is not a dedicated component of the CERFP, but it can be provided from the HRF, the state response force, or other ARNG or ANG resources. (See appendix E for more information on the search and extraction element.) CERFP ROLES AND RESPONSIBLITIES 2-2.  The CERFP plans and conducts C2; casualty search and extraction; ambulatory and nonambulatory decontamination;  emergency  medical  triage,  treatment,  and  patient  stabilization;  and  fatality  search  and recovery. When directed, the CERFP can be pre-positioned or respond using organic transportation to an incident to support the incident command. 2-3.  The  states  maintain  overall  responsibility  for  ensuring  that  the  CERFP  is  trained,  validated, exercised, and prepared to respond in support of incidents at civil and military locations. The CERFP can be  tailored  for  specific  mission  requirements  and  may  operate  under  the  JFHQ-state,  JTF-state,  or  a response force assigned to a federal response organization (10 USC status). Following an incident, there are two primary concerns that exist—the initial response and augmentation of Tier 1 unit capability to meet the challenges  posed  by  multiple  locations  or  large-scale  incidents  involving  mass  casualties  from  CBRN hazards.  For  those  regions  that  have  adequately  trained  and  equipped  personnel,  the  challenge  lies  in sustainment  and  sufficient  numbers  of  personnel  to  meet  CBRN  consequence  management  support requirements. Very specialized units from civil and military organizations are regularly requested to help fill  these  technical  gaps  or  provide  augmentation  to  existing  capabilities  of  first-response  organizations when responding to small incidents. The CERFP capabilities are specifically tailored to augment, support, 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 2-1 Chapter 2  or relieve existing local, state, and federal capabilities and to fill the void where none of those resources are present. 2-4.  The CERFP deploys upon notification of a validated request for support and sets up decontamination operations  after  arrival  at  the  incident  site.  The  CERFP  has  the  capability  to  set  up  multiple decontamination  lanes.  Single-  and  dual-lane  configurations  use  less  setup  time.  Tier  1  initial  rescue personnel may need relief and considerable augmentation and support. Large-scale incidents and multiple-location incidents may need CERFP capabilities for many hours or days, as Tier 1 and 2 responders move in  and  out  of  potentially  contaminated  areas.  Contaminated  and  uncontaminated  incident  casualties  are recovered  from  collapsed  structure  environments  and  may  or  may  not  need  medical  treatment  and decontamination before being evacuated. 2-5.  The CERFP supports civil and military requirements that are essential to the defense of the United States, are in response to CBRN incidents outlined in the National Strategy for Homeland Security, and provide civil support outlined in DODD 3025.18. The CERFP further implements the concepts originated in Defense Reform Initiative Directive 25.  2-6.  If the JTF-state is deployed, the CERFP is under the C2 of the HRF or JTF commander. The JTF-state  includes  consequence  management  capabilities  in  addition  to  the  CERFPs  needed  to  accomplish  a DSCA and CBRN consequence management mission. 2-7.  CERFP commanders must be prepared to independently deploy any or all of the CERFPs capabilities outside the normal unit configuration to support incident commander needs or objectives. CERFP ELEMENTS AND SUPPORTING TEAMS 2-8.  A CERFP is modular in structure, with four operational components and, when assigned, an ANG fatality search and recovery team. Operational components include—    A C2 element.    A  search  and  extraction  element  (an  ARNG  engineer  company  or  an  ANG  civil  engineering squadron).    A medical element (an ANG medical group).    A decontamination element, preferably an ARNG CBRN company.    An ANG fatality search and recovery team (ANG force support squadron, sustainment services flight). 2-9.  If the required modified table of organization and equipment and unit-manning document structure do not exist within the state, states can assign the mission to an alternate unit as a temporary measure while the state pursues manpower actions to satisfy a longer-duration assignment requirement. The assignment of modified table of organization and equipment and unit-manning documents from an adjoining state may be used. If elements of the CERFP are from more than one state, a memorandum of agreement, a clear chain of command, and activation authority may be established. The CERFP mission may be reassigned by the National  Guard  Bureau  to  another  state  that  possesses the  required  forces  if  the required force  structure does  not  exist  within  the  state,  the  required  force  structure  cannot  be  converted  from  the  current  force structure of the state, and support cannot be obtained from a neighboring state. 2-10.  The  CERFP  C2  accomplishes  required  incident  response  coordination  actions  with  the  incident command  system,  civil  support  team,  JTF-state,  JFHQ-state,  or  combatant  commanders  and  JTF-civil support  chain  of  command  unless  or  until  an  HRF  is  assigned  to  provide  that  C2  and  liaison  mission. Additional organizations that may be attached to the JTF-state and can provide direct support to the CERFP include  a  firefighting  element,  air  and  ground  casualty  transportation  assets,  and  ANG  medical  support teams. Civil support teams work in conjunction with CERFP, but are not an organic element of the team package.  The  JFHQ-state  may  establish  processes  for  administrative  and  logistics  requirements  that  are necessary for maintaining training certifications, orders, travel arrangements, and equipment maintenance and storage venues. 2-2 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Organizations and Roles  CERFP C2 ELEMENT 2-11.  The C2 battalion or squadron headquarters—   Ensures C2 of CERFP response elements.   Establishes the area of operations.   Shares incident operations information with the CERFP.   Provides CERFP area of operations safety and element rotation planning. (See figure 2-1, page 2-4.) Note. Sustainment operations planning and situation reports incorporate religious support team support into the CERFP incident action plan. MEDICAL ELEMENT 2-12.  The ANG medical element support provides—   Triage, injury identification, and triage tagging.   Emergency medical treatment and casualty management until evacuation (cold zone).   Patient tracking and accountability (cold zone).   Medical support during decontamination, as needed.   Medical surveillance and treatment as required for CERFP personnel.   Trained medical support within each search and extraction element. SEARCH AND EXTRACTION ELEMENT 2-13.  The ARNG engineering unit or ANG civil engineering unit provides—   Confined-space operations.   Structural-collapse operations.   Rope rescue operations. DECONTAMINATION ELEMENT 2-14.  The ARNG CBRN company provides—   Ambulatory and nonambulatory decontamination operations.   Technical decontamination operations.   Warm-zone monitoring, as directed.   Casualty movement from the casualty collection point through the decontamination line to the medical log-in point.  FATALITY SEARCH AND RECOVERY TEAM ELEMENT 2-15.  The fatality search and recovery team—   Searches for fatalities in a CBRN environment.   Recovers fatalities in a CBRN environment, which includes locating, collecting, documenting, temporarily staging, and transporting fatalities. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 2-3 Chapter 2   Legend: aero-med ASHC ASMC C2 CE CERFP COMSUPCEN CST decon EMEDS FSRT IT JFHQ JTF-S MEDEVAC NG TF WMD aeromedical assault support helicopter company area support medical company command and control communications element chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives response force package consequence management support center civil support team decontamination expeditionary medical support fatality search and recovery team information technology joint force headquarters joint task force-state medical evacuation National Guard task force weapons of mass destruction  Figure 2-1.

Upon notification of a CERFP support request and alert or recall, the National Guard  Consequence  Management  Support  Center  is  also  contacted  to  provide  support  for  CERFP nonstandard equipment. 2-4 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Organizations and Roles  CERFP EMPLOYMENT  2-17.  Several validated concepts frame CERFP operations. The following are some of these concepts:   National response operations are organized and supported using a tiered response of local, state, and federal responders (Tier 1, 2, or 3). The CERFP is normally employed as an element of the state response under National Guard JFHQ administrative control.   The  CERFP  (state  active  duty  or  32  USC  status)  operates  within  the  state  emergency management incident command system in a supporting modular configuration (C2 plus casualty search  and  extraction,  C2  plus  decontamination  team,  C2  plus  medical  team)  when  requested through the state emergency management system.   The CERFP operates as an element of a geographic combatant command JTF. If federalized (10 USC status), the JTF of the supported combatant commander (JTF-civil support or appropriate JTF) exercises operational control of the assigned CERFP.   Multiple CERFPs are required to sustain and maintain continuous operations.   Some degree of perimeter security is needed to allow the CERFP commander time to quickly set up without external interference from victims seeking aid or assistance.  2-18.  For large-scale operations and some continuous operations, an HRF may be deployed when multiple weapons  of  mass  destruction-civil  support  teams  and/or  CERFPs  are  operating  at  the  same  incident. Establishing  and  maintaining  a  unity  of  effort  throughout  these  operations  is  vital.  CBRN  enterprise elements (HRF, CERFP, weapons of mass destruction-civil support team) may be deployed for response modes  (no-notice,  stand-by,  predeployment  situations).  HRFs  normally  deploy  in  situations  that  involve catastrophic incidents or operations that extend over large areas for long periods of time.  HRF ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2-19.  The HRF is composed of traditional National Guard Soldiers as a part of the CBRN task force that conducts CBRN consequence management response in support of civil authorities to save lives, mitigate human  suffering,  and  maintain  public  confidence  to  alleviate  CBRN  incident  effects.  The  HRF  alerts, assembles, and is ready to deploy within 6 hours. Once complete, the HRF transitions operations to civil authorities and redeploys. 2-20.  The HRF  is  composed  of  traditional National  Guard  Soldiers  and Airmen  who  are  task-organized from  existing  National  Guard  units  to  provide  C2  maneuvers,  area  operations,  and  specialized  CBRN consequence management capabilities to local, state, and federal authorities. These units are provided with special  training  and  equipment  to  plan  and  conduct  casualty  search  and  extraction;  emergency  medical triage,  treatment,  and  patient  stabilization;  and  mass  casualty  decontamination  in  a  contaminated  or uncontaminated environment in support of the incident command system. The HRF has additional full-time manning of some positions to increase responsiveness and readiness. 2-21.  When requested, the HRF responds to an incident of state or national level significance to provide the C2 and assets to support incident action plan objectives. A casualty assistance support element is also required  to  provide  protection,  cordon  and  entry  control  points,  and  additional  manpower  for  activities (moving  casualties  in  the  CERFP  area  of  responsibility).  The  casualty  assistance  support  element  is  a dedicated component of the HRF. States may be required to deploy an additional security element (such as the National Guard response force) in support of CBRN consequence management. 2-22.  The states maintain overall responsibility for ensuring that the HRF is trained, validated, exercised, and  prepared  to  respond  in  support  of  CBRN  incidents.  The  HRF  can  be  tailored  for  specific  mission requirements and may operate under the JFHQ-state, JTF-state, or a response force assigned to a federal (10 USC status) JTF. Following attacks like those of 11 September 2011, there are two emergency response gaps that exist—the initial response and the augmentation of Tier 1 unit capability to meet the challenges posed  by  multiple  locations  or  large-scale  incidents  involving  mass  casualties  from  CBRN  hazards.  For those regions that have adequately trained and equipped personnel, the challenge lies in sustainment and sufficient  numbers  of  personnel  to  meet  CBRN  consequence  management  support  requirements. Specialized units from civil and military organizations are regularly requested to help fill technical gaps or provide augmentation to existing capabilities of first-response organizations when responding to relatively 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 2-5 Chapter 2  small events. The capabilities of the HRF are specifically tailored to augment, support, or relieve existing local,  state,  and  federal  capabilities  and  to  fill  the  void  where  none  of  those  resources  are  present.  The CBRN task force elements of the HRF retain individual identity when operating as an HRF. The HRF or CERFP  commander  has  discretion  on  the  use  of  subordinate  units  or  elements.  The  intent  is  that  the CERFP  remains  intact.  The  operational  elements  are  not  separated  unless  approved  by  the  HRF  and/or CERFP commander, usually in response to specific needs of the incident commander. HRF HIGHER-HEADQUARTERS RELATIONSHIPS 2-23.  The position of the HRF within a JTF-state and JFHQ-state organization and command structure is depicted in figure 2-2, page 2-7. HRF TASK ORGANIZATION 2-24.  The HRF is modular in structure with a C2 element and five operational elements. The operational elements  include  a  security  element,  a  CERFP  C2  element,  a  search  and  extraction  element,  a  medical element, and a decontamination element. In addition to supporting the voice and data information exchange requirements  for  CBRN  operations,  the  organic  CE  of  the  HRF  C2  element  manages  communication security/information  security,  including  cyber  and  electronic  security  measures  to  ensure  uninterrupted operations and to prevent the loss of sensitive information. Communication security must be provided to the CE by a supporting communication security account manager.  HRF C2 ELEMENT 2-25.  The HRF C2 closely resembles an ARNG brigade model and provides C2, issues orders, conducts deployment  operations,  establishes  an  area  of  operations,  establishes  communications,  and  conducts incident response operations. 2-26.  The  HRF  C2  accomplishes  the  required  incident  response  coordination  actions  with  the  incident commander, weapons of mass destruction-civil support team, CERFP, other HRFs, JTF-state, JFHQ-state, or the combatant commanders/JTF-civil support chain of command. Additional organizations that may be attached to the JTF-state and that can provide direct support to the HRF include a firefighting element, air and ground casualty transportation assets, medical support teams, and a communications element. Weapons of mass destruction-civil support teams work in conjunction with the HRF, but are not an organic element of the team package. The JFHQ-state may establish processes for administrative and logistics requirements that are required for the maintenance of training certifications, orders, travel, and equipment maintenance and storage CBRN ASSISTANCE SUPPORT ELEMENT 2-27.  The casualty assistance support element provides support to HRF elements in the form of protection and casualty assistance support as directed. While the main effort is to support the CBRN task force, the casualty assistance support element may be required to provide limited protection for the HRF C2 element. The area of operations for a casualty assistance support element may consist of the cold, warm, and hot zones of an incident site. The casualty assistance support element can also provide manpower to assist with litter  bearing  and  casualty  movement.  (See  appendix  F  for  more  information  on  the  CBRN  support element.) 2-28.  If  additional  protection  is  required  in  the  cold  zone,  the  HRF  commander  may  request  National Guard response force deployment. The National Guard response force is an integral element of the JTF-state and is available to support the HRF, but not an element of the HRF. If additional assistance is required in the contaminated area (warm or hot zone), the HRF commander may request support from another HRF. The casualty assistance support element is not one of the same units assigned to support the National Guard response force mission.

Notional CERFPF within a JFHQ-state organization  PROTECTION 2-29.  The HRF commander is responsible for the protection of task force personnel and equipment and coordinates  with  the  incident  commander  to  ensure  that  protection  needs  are  met.  Risk  assessments  of potential threats to responding HRFs and property are conducted during mission planning. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 2-7 Chapter 2  2-30.  The casualty assistance support element deploys with individual weapons. They are stored according to  the  rules  for  use  of  force.  No  crew-served  weapons  are  required  when  deploying.  Memorandums  of understanding  and  memorandums  of  agreement  between  states  address  the  rules  for  use  of  force  with consideration regarding the storage of ammunition and the use of weapons. It is recommended that the rules for use of force be standardized within each HRF region. 2-31.  The state rules for use of force guidance applies to National Guard members who are deployed in support of a CBRN consequence management mission and are operating in a 32 USC status or state active duty status. In the event of 10 USC federalization, the specific combatant commander rules for use of force or  the  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  rules  for  use  of  force  will  apply.  Commanders  need  to  be prepared to conduct the necessary rules for use of force retraining that a change in status may need. The casualty assistance support element serves in support of the HRF and provides limited protection to the CERFP/HRF C2 elements. The casualty assistance support element is usually not directly engaged in law enforcement  duties.  The  adjutants general are  responsible  for  establishing  the  rules for use of  force  and arming criteria for the National Guard.  EMPLOYMENT 2-32.  During a major catastrophe, supported states follow normal EMAC and memorandum of agreement procedures and coordinate with the National Guard Bureau, neighboring states, and the federal government for  assistance.  HRF  units  take  preemptive  actions  to  prepare  for  deployment  if  situational  awareness indicates that other states may need assistance. The primary method of a unit responding to an incident is ground transportation with organic vehicles. If air transportation is needed, it is coordinated through the JTF-state to the National Guard Bureau and then through DOD to a transportation command. 2-33.  The  HRF  most  likely  assembles  and  mobilizes  under  32  USC  status  authority,  responding  to  the governors of the affected states, through the EMAC process. In extreme situations, units may be mobilized as part of a federal response and become 10 USC assets.  2-34.  Although  the  mission  has  been  validated,  other  questions  may  arise.  JFHQ-state  and  JTF-state commanders must ensure that National Guard assets are used for appropriate, feasible DSCA missions that have an expected outcome which justifies the risk of their employment. 2-35.  If the JTF-state is deployed, the CERFP/HRF is then under the C2 of the JTF commander. The JTF-state includes consequence management capabilities and the CERFP/HRFs needed to accomplish a DSCA and CBRN consequence management mission. 2-36.  The search and extraction element, with integrated medical personnel, locates and removes casualties from  confined  space  and/or  collapsed-structure  environments.  The  casualty  assistance  support  element assists the search and extraction and medical elements with the movement of casualties from the point of extraction  to  the  casualty  collection  point.  The  medical  element  performs  initial  triage  and  prioritizes nonambulatory  casualties  for  the  decontamination  lanes.  The  decontamination  element  conducts  patient movement  from  the  casualty  collection  point  to  the  decontamination  site  log-in  station  and  manages ambulatory and nonambulatory decontamination monitoring and processing from the warm zone to the cold zone.  It  is  at  this  point  that  medical  element  teams  can  provide  emergency  medical  treatment  and stabilization in the cold zone while awaiting evacuation by incident command assets. Medical support is required from the hot zone through the warm zone to ready evacuees for transportation to the cold zone. 2-37.  At predetermined intervals, the fatality search and recovery team can be inserted downrange into the incident site for the search, recovery, and movement of contaminated remains to a collection point in the warm zone. 2-38.  In the event of a CBRN mass casualty event, the first 72 hours are critical for local, state, tribal, and federal response forces. Pending the size and lethality of the event, resources from local, state, and federal agencies may be leveraged to ensure that a seamless, comprehensive response is formed and dedicated to save lives and initiate recovery operations as soon as possible. 2-39.  Initially, the civil support team may not support an HRF, but coordinates with the JFHQ-state/JTF-state. Subsequently, one or more civil support teams may be allocated as operational control to the HRFs and  then  validate  follow-on  requests  for  additional  assessment  requirements  coming  from  civilian 2-8 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Organizations and Roles  authorities or incident commanders in that area. The civil support teams follow their own unit procedures and coordinate tactical control with the incident command in regard to deployments. Stand-alone CERFPs from other states may deploy independently or as part of an HRF. Once deployed, the HRF reports to the JFHQ-state/JTF-state of the supported state. The HRF is then task-organized to meet mission requirements. Regional HRFs deploy and report to a JFHQ-state/JTF-state of the supported state. 2-40.  The  supporting  state  may  mobilize  additional  forces  to  support  the  HRF  in  concert  with  the supported state (for example, in line with EMAC or memorandum of agreement). These units may be the National  Guard  response  forces,  fatality  search  and  recovery  teams,  religious  support  teams,  or  other logistics or sustainment units as required. 2-41.  Governors of states with an HRF may use HRF units and elements for an all-hazards response as required. In this status, they are not defined as an HRF; at this point, they are another unit being used for all-hazards situations. This may be in state active duty or 32 USC status based on the proper authority for the  event;  however,  if  an  HRF  is  used  outside  of  the  assigned  state,  it  is  subject  to  memorandums  of agreement, memorandums of understanding, EMACs, or other agreements to determine the legal status of the forces. The HRF unit and elements are still subject to recall as an HRF and are required to meet the N-hour timelines. 2-42.  Several conditions frame the operations of the HRF. These include—   National response operations that are organized and supported using a tiered response of local, state, and federal responders (Tier 1, 2, or 3). The HRF is normally employed as an element of the state response under JFHQ C2.   Multiple  CERFPs  or  an  HRF  that  may  be  required  to  sustain  and  maintain  continuous operations.   HRF employment that varies from mission to mission. During the course of a response, an HRF may be deployed under 10 USC status by the President.   The  CERFP/HRF  being  under  operational  control  (when  federalized  [10  USC  status])  to  the supported combatant commander (JTF-civil support or appropriate dual status JTF). ALERT AND RESPONSE 2-43.  For the CERFP/HRF to alert and assemble as designed, a catastrophic incident must have occurred as designated by the governor or proper federal authorities. Governors intending to proactively gain authority to alert the HRF must work with the proper State Emergency Management Agency and FEMA authorities to validate the mission before the HRF can be mobilized under 32 USC 502(f) status. In turn, FEMA and the  National  Guard  Bureau  inform  the  DOD  of  the  federal  nature  of  the  mission  request  and  obtain Secretary of Defense approval for funding. If that event designation has not been achieved and the governor still intends to use their capabilities, the HRF would then alert and deploy in state active duty authority. If the governor does deploy the HRF in state active duty status and the disaster is subsequently identified as a federal  CBRN  incident,  applicable  laws  and  regulations  would  determine  if  state  active  duty  would  be retroactively reimbursed with federal funds. RESPONSE MODES 2-44.  The HRF  may  be  used  in  response  modes that  are  driven  by  intelligence  or  the  magnitude  of  the event, as dictated by state or federal civilian and military authorities. These modes are—   No-notice. This is the standard response when an incident occurs. Support is requested; and the CERFP/HRF is notified, assembled, and deployed. This response method is the least preferred and the most challenging. CERFP/HRF personnel may be out of the area and must assemble and then move to the incident. It also results in the slowest response.   Standby. The standby response mode allows a quicker response than a no-notice response, but still uses movement time and the funding to place people on orders. The two standby-response modes are:   HRF  personnel  have  been  notified  that  an  event  has  occurred  or  is  imminent  (based  on intelligence) and are prepared to receive notification of deployment. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 2-9 Chapter 2   Personnel are placed on orders and assembled at the home station, but they do not deploy.    Predeployed. This response is usually used for national special-security events. HRFs are placed on orders, assembled, and moved to a location near the event. This mode has the advantage of being the most responsive and allows deliberate planning and prior coordination. However, it is time- and manpower-intensive and it is not sustainable for long periods of time. The long-term monitoring of personnel may be required based on the exposure to hazmat. Units and elements may  not  redeploy  until  contaminated  equipment  is  properly  disposed  of  according  to  military and civilian regulations. OPERATIONAL PHASES 2-45.  Figure  2-3,  page  2-11,  describes  the  DOD  CBRN  response  by  operational  phase  during  natural disasters and civil emergencies. The purpose of this support is to be timely, effective, and efficient to save lives, reduce human suffering, and mitigate property damage. Concept of Operation Plan 3500 and Concept of  Operation  Plan  3501  use  the  six-phase  construct  of  shape,  anticipate,  respond,  operate,  stabilize,  and transition while JP 5-0 uses the six-phase construct of shape, deter, seize the initiative, dominate, stabilize, and  enable  civil  authorities.  Both  constructs  are  represented  in  figure  2-3.  (See  appendix  G  for  more information on operations conducted by the CERFP/HRF during these phases.)  OPERATIONS SUPPORT 2-46.  CERFPs/HRFs  usually  work  through  the  JTF-state,  the  JFHQ-state,  and  the  Consequence Management  Support  Center  to  identify  and  coordinate  the  backfill  of  mission  equipment  readiness Category A and B equipment items. The Consequence Management Support Center is prepared to provide immediate  service  and  sustainment  support  for  nonstandard  and  commercial,  off-the-shelf  equipment  as requested. If employed in a federal status, the CERFP/HRF logistics sustainment support is incorporated into  the  combatant  commander’s  or  the  joint  forces  land  component  commander’s  operation  plan  and operation order processes. 2-47.  The  CERFP/HRF  forces  prepare  for  interaction  with  vetted  media  sources  during  response  and lifesaving operations. CERFP/HRF commanders ensure that members of the media are supported by state and  federal  public  affairs  personnel.  While  these  interactions  can  be  important,  interviews  and  filming requests are scheduled and coordinated through the established state or federal joint information center as outlined in the incident action plan. 2-48.  The  U.S.  Property  and  Fiscal  Office  in  each  state  and  the  surgeon,  chaplain,  public  affairs, communications,  operations,  intelligence,  and  logistics  staffs  prepare  to  support  the  operational employment of the CERFP/HRF. 2-49.  Geographically  dispersed  response  areas  affect  communications  systems,  spans  of  control,  and support  requirements.  CERFP/HRF  commanders  carefully  evaluate  their  capabilities,  resources,  and mission tasks and are careful to not overextend response resources. 2-50.  The U.S. Northern Command, U.S. Pacific Command, or other supported combatant commanders must prioritize airlift capabilities for CBRN forces beyond their authorized distance to move by ground. 2-51.  The supported state—   Verifies capability requests from the State Emergency Management Agency against EMACs and executes existing EMACs, memorandums of understanding, and memorandums of agreement.   Establishes new EMACs for capability shortfalls.   Requests support for shortfall capabilities from the National Guard Coordination Center via the joint  information  exchange  environment  and  a  request  for  assistance  according  to  local procedures. 2-10 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Organizations and Roles  Figure 2-3. CBRN enterprise response force relation to DSCA   Ensures that the governor’s declaration of emergency authorization is received from the Office of the Secretary of Defense.   Ensures that a deployment order is issued for designated CBRN assets according to the incident command system.   Ensures that units alert, assemble, prepare, and deploy according to the unit procedures, standard operating guidance, and deployment order.  26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 2-11 Chapter 2    Ensures that weapons of mass destruction-civil support teams alert, marshal, and deploy upon the notification of a CBRN incident and serve as the initial DOD CBRN liaison officers at the incident site.   Ensures  that  the  CERFP  (if  assigned)  alerts,  marshals,  and  deploys  in  response  to  CBRN incidents.   Ensures  that  the  JFHQ-state  and  JTF-state  establish  the  joint  reception;  staging,  onward movement; and integration process if the process is not identified in the HRF regional response plan for arriving units. The joint reception; staging, onward movement; and integration evolves and expands from Phase III to Phase IV of the operation.   Ensures that, once established, the JTF-state conducts battle handover to the JFHQ-state joint operations center. 2-52.  The supporting state—   Contacts the supported state for situational awareness and EMAC status (such as the decision to execute an EMAC, memorandum of understanding, or memorandum of agreement).   Receives authorization from the State Emergency Management Agency to execute the mission. An authorization from the Office of the Secretary of Defense mobilizes designated units (civil support teams, HRF) according to mission requirements.   Executes existing missions and identifies capability shortfalls to the supported state and National Guard Bureau.   Ensures that the adjutant general directs designated units to mobilize and be prepared to deploy within the prescribed timelines.    Coordinates direct liaison authorization for HRF and for direct liaison authorized liaison officers to JFHQ-state, JTF-state, and the incident commander. Issues a deployment order for designated CBRN assets according to mission requirements and upon  coordination  with  the  supported  state.  The  deployment  order  contains  instructions  for deployment from the home station to the supported state, such as—   Transportation.   Routes.   Class III supplies.  Security. In-state requirements.    Changes in rules for use of force.   Technical information regarding the CBRN incident.  Joint reception; staging, onward movements; and integration requirements of the supported state.   Ensures that the HRF JFHQ-state coordinates movement of the HRF by ground or air based on the situation. Units prepare to deploy by ground if the incident site is less than 600 miles away.   Coordinates  the  HRF  direct  liaison  authorized  to  the  JFHQ-state/JTF-state  and  the  incident commander.   Ensures that units alert, assemble, prepare, and deploy according to the unit procedures, standard operating guidance, and deployment order.   Ensures  that  the  JFHQ-state  joint  operations  center  provides  situational  awareness  and situational understanding to the National Guard Coordination Center. SAFETY  2-53.  Operating in personal protective equipment (PPE) constitutes some of the more complex and difficult lifesaving activities that emergency responders may encounter. Some of these activities include performing the  CERFP/HRF  site  setup,  search  and  extraction,  rapid  injury  stabilization  in  confined  spaces,  litter extractions  from  collapsed-structure  environments,  medical  triage,  the  decontamination  of  contaminated nonambulatory personnel, and the medical stabilization of CERFP site patients. If element personnel and 2-12 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Organizations and Roles  leaders fail to execute their respective assignments in a safe and professional manner, the risk of injury to CERFP/HRF members or others is greatly increased. 2-54.  The  CERFP/HRF  commander  and  element  leaders  have  the  primary  responsibility  to  ensure  that sound  safety  and  force  health  protection  practices  are  applied  during  site  setup  and  while  conducting CERFP/HRF  operations.  Safety  and  force  health  protection  are  stressed  during  mission  briefings  and evaluated during postmission, after action review critiques. 2-55.  The CERFP/HRF safety officer ensures that safety measures and operations adhere to the established incident  action  and  safety  plans.  The  CERFP/HRF  tactical  operations  center  reviews  each  missions  risk assessment before committing CERFP/HRF members beyond the established warm-zone boundaries. The CERFP/HRF  risk  assessment  is  updated  as  the  mitigation  planning  and  incident  commander  tasks  are accomplished. 2-56.  If  the  incident  commander  has  not  developed  a  safety  plan,  the  JTF-state  commander  or  the CERFP/HRF commanders develop and distribute a safety plan according to the incident command system. (See  appendix  H.)  It  is  essential  that  CERFP/HRF  members  operating  in  cold,  warm,  and  hot  zones recognize the high priority that is afforded to incident site safety. Personnel have a responsibility to identify unsafe acts and hazardous situations. 2-57.  Commanders  assess,  evaluate,  and  decide  when  to  accept  prudent  risk  to  create  opportunities  to achieve  decisive  results.  Risk  is  an  inherent  aspect  of  command.  The  CERFP/HRF  may  be  required  to accept operational or tactical risk to increase support. The CERFP/HRF can mitigate tactical risks by—   Shifting resources.   Changing priorities.   Phasing or sequencing operations.   Reducing the tasks assigned to a subordinate element or the area of operations.   Deciding where to assume risk when required.  2-58.  Some high-risk situations may need CERFP/HRF commanders to exercise detailed C2, allowing for less flexibility at lower levels.     26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 2-13 This page intentionally left blank.    Chapter 3 CERFP/HRF C2 C2  is  a  conduit  for  the  coordination  and  continuity  of  operations  during  a  CBRN incident. The elements work in a dual system, making themselves National Incident Management  System-compliant,  while  maintaining  military  capabilities.  More  than any other component of the CERFP/HRF, C2 is prepared to deal with whom there is no preexisting or habitual relationship. CERFP C2 ELEMENT 3-1.  The CERFP C2 element provides valuable civil-military coordination information to other military response organizations. Requests for information from organizations outside the CERFP chain of command are directed to the JFHQ-state. 3-2.  The CERFP C2 element is composed of personnel from ARNG or ANG units. Their responsibilities are to—   Ensure  that  overall  mission  readiness  is  maintained  to  accomplish  successful  CERFP  mission completion.   Ensure  that  personnel  and  equipment  are  ready  to  deploy  upon  notification  and  that  they seamlessly  integrate  into  the  local  incident  command  system  and  the  National  Incident Management System.   Ensure that the CERFP C2 element is prepared to execute and manage the recall of the CERFP.   Coordinate adequate transportation for CERFP personnel and equipment.   Ensure that the required individual and collective training are accomplished.   Ensure that the equipment assigned to each CERFP element is onhand and mission-capable.   Direct CERFP deployment.   Coordinate interaction with the incident command and the military task force C2 chain to which the CERFP C2 element is assigned.   Employ appropriate CERFP capabilities to accomplish the incident mitigation objectives of the incident commander.   Perform joint intelligence preparation of the environment.   Coordinate  an  information  awareness  assessment to  ensure  situational  awareness of  the  threat environment.   Maintain communications at the incident site with the incident commander, HRF, and/or JTF-state commander to ensure the synchronization of CERFP actions, including safety and support operations in the cold zone and staging area.   Ensure  that  the  C2  element  redeployment  planning  of  the  CERFP  establishes  sequencing  to provide closeout and other reports as required when the objectives of the incident commander are accomplished. 3-3.  The CERFP C2 element integrates incident command system functions and DOD response planning to conduct continuous operations. It is composed of a commander and staff that cover administrative and finance, supplies and logistics, and operations and planning. Additionally, there is a safety officer; a liaison to the incident commander; and liaisons from subordinate CERFP elements, communications, and adequate personnel  to  conduct  continuous  operations.  (See  appendix  I  for  more  information  on  the  phases  of operations.) 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 3-1 Chapter 3  HRF C2 ELEMENT 3-4.  The  HRF  has  C2  over  multiple  CBRN  response  forces  over  a  dispersed  geographic  footprint  and coordinates and synchronizes response operations with the required military units, elements, and incident command system entities. The HRF C2 element deploys in the cold zone far enough away to avoid possible contamination.  The  HRF  C2  element  is  usually  located  away  from  CERFP  elements.  They  have communications or a representative with the supported state, incident command center, JFHQ-state and/or JTF-state,  and  other  higher-level  organizations  if  appropriate.  The  HRF  has  communications  with  the CERFP, casualty assistance support element, and other CBRN units and elements as applicable to their area of operations. Each HRF C2 element includes planners who develop and synchronize CBRN plans in the FEMA  region  to  which  they  are  attached.  In  addition  to  CBRN  operations,  HRF  C2  elements  maintain communication security/information security, including cyber and electronic security measures to ensure uninterrupted operations and prevent the loss of sensitive information. 3-5.  The primary responsibilities of an HRF C2 element include—   Conducting intratheater deployment and redeployment of forces within the joint operations area.   Conducting the mobilization of tactical units.   Conducting tactical deployment and redeployment activities.   Providing operational C2.   Planning operations.   Executing tactical operations.   Conducting command post operations to support tactical operations.   Managing information and data.   Establishing information networks and systems.   Providing interface or liaison among military and civilian organizations.   Protecting the force.   Providing operational logistics and personnel support.   Requesting supplies.   Conducting unit logistics package operations.   Conducting personnel accounting.   Providing medical treatment. RESPONSIBILITIES AND RELATIONSHIPS 3-6.  The  CERFP/HRF  is  assigned  to  the  state  and  is  operationally  committed  to  support  an  incident commander through the military chain of command. At the incident site, the CERFP/HRF operates in direct support of the civil authorities. In this role, the CERFP/HRF supports the goals and objectives developed by the incident commander in the incident action plan. As an incident expands, the scope and functions of the incident commander change. The CERFP/HRF on-site assets and the magnitude of the incident affect the C2 relationship during the incident response. 3-7.  The  chain  of  command  for  the  CERFP/HRF  depends  on  the  duty  status  of  the  task  force.  The CERFP/HRF is organized and operates in state active duty or according to 32 USC status, under which the governor and the adjutant general provide C2 for deployed state military forces. If federalized, under 10 USC  status,  the  CERFP/HRF  is  subject  to  employment  according  to  applicable  command  relationships established by the supported combatant commander or JTF. 3-8.  The supported JFHQ-state joint operations center tracks the movement and assigned missions of the CERFP/HRF  through  the  HRF  or  stand-alone  CERFP  tactical  operations  center.  During  a  response,  the CERFP/HRF updates higher headquarters to ensure situational awareness. 3-9.  To achieve and maintain readiness, the CERFP/HRF commander—   Develops and communicates an annual operational training vision for the units assigned to the CERFP/HRF mission.   Develops a CERFP/HRF mission-essential task list. 3-2 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 CERFP/HRF C2    Develops and submits a long-range training calendar to the adjutant general.   Ensures that CERFP/HRF personnel accomplish individual training to established standards.   Ensures that CERFP/HRF personnel focus training against the best assessment of the most likely and most dangerous threat tactics, techniques, and procedures and courses of action.   Plans and conducts at least two annual collective training exercises to evaluate and improve the integration  of  CERFP/HRF  capabilities  and  successfully  accomplishes  the  required  external evaluation and readiness to support the incident commander.   Ensures  that  critical  deficiencies  identified  during  the  training  and  evaluation  process  are corrected after each incident, with the corrections incorporated into the next scheduled training activity or training event.   Provides an external evaluation completion report to facilitate the adjutant general validation of the state CERFP/HRF readiness to accomplish assigned missions.   Submits  required  readiness  reports  through  the  Defense  Readiness  Reporting  System  for  the state, National Guard Bureau, combatant commanders, Services, and DOD.  3-10.  If  a  unit  with  the  CERFP/HRF  mission  changes  because  of  deployments  or  rotations,  the  state determines  if  a  reevaluation  is  required.  The  National  Guard  Bureau  domestic  operations  and  force development division (J-37) provides a detailed training and evaluation plan for external evaluations. 3-11.  Each  CERFP/HRF  receives additional  training  days  for ARNG  and  ANG  each  year  above  the  39 statutory days. Given the joint ARNG and ANG organization of the CERFP/HRF, it is important that the C2 element plans and coordinates training times and resources to ensure that members participate in joint and  interagency  collective  training  (state  homeland  security,  state  emergency  management,  incident command system, JFHQ-state). 3-12.  Lessons learned from training, exercises, and external evaluations are collected and incorporated into planning for future training cycles. 3-13.  Operationally, the CERFP/HRF commander ensures that—   Scheduling  and participation  in  local,  state,  regional,  and  federal planning  meetings  to  ensure unit participation in multijurisdictional full-scale exercises.   The CERFP/HRF and its element and team capabilities, requirements, and mission are clearly understood  by  the  supported  organization  (incident  command,  JTF-civil  support,  state emergency management).   The  CERFP/HRF  National  Guard  and  Reserve  positions  are  mandated  to  maintain  the CERFP/HRF training, equipment, medical formulary, resources, and deployment readiness.   Security is available for incident operations. Habitual relations are developed before activation. CERFP/HRF operations without security may result in dangerous conditions for CERFP/HRF elements and team members and for other responders.   A site safety plan is submitted to the incident commander. 3-14.  Logistically, the CERFP/HRF commander ensures that—   Scheduled  periodic  inventories  and  the  rotation  maintenance  of  medical  supplies  are accomplished;  date-sensitive  or  perishable  supplies  are  inventoried,  stored  appropriately,  and monitored  for  expiration;  and  current  inventories  of  mission  equipment  and  consumable  and expendable supplies are maintained.   Calibration, services, and serviceability are maintained.   Vehicle and trailer fleets are maintained, managed, and ready to deploy.   Load plans are developed and maintained. 3-15.  The  CERFP/HRF  commander  is  well  versed  on  other  National  Guard  capabilities  and  assets  and should  be  prepared  to  request  support  through  the  incident  command  or  higher  military  headquarters. Public  affairs support  is  a  frequently  requested  asset, whether for  information  on  the  National  Guard or CERFP/HRF  or  assistance  in  dealing  with  the  media.  Commanders  follow  guidance  from  the  incident commander  and  their  state  and  coordinate  efforts  through  the  public  information  officer  and  joint information center. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 3-3 Chapter 3  3-16.  The medical readiness of each member must be maintained. Members from CERFP/HRF elements and teams complete their tasks in established levels of PPE according to the operational requirements as set forth by the National Guard Bureau J-3. 3-17.  A dedicated CERFP/HRF communication capability is essential for timely information flow between military units, task forces, and incident command system entities. C2 elements must be prepared to use an organic communication capability because the existing communication infrastructure may be destroyed or unusable. 3-18.  Communications with DOD elements, incident command system entities, and government agencies for incident management are necessary for successful operations and incident site management.  3-19.  The CERFP/HRF C2 element communicates with the supported-state JTF-state or joint operations center  and  the  supporting-state  joint  operations  center.  The  incident  commander  is  the  point  of  contact between  the  CERFP/HRF  and  other  emergency  agencies.  Communications  with  the  National  Guard Coordination Center are processed through the supported state JTF-state. LIAISON ESTABLISHMENT 3-20.  Establishing  and  maintaining  liaison  officers  with  the  incident  commander,  subordinate  entities, JFHQ-state, and JTF-state are vital to the success of the CBRN consequence management  mission. The HRF may provide liaison officers to the incident commander and the military chain of command (JFHQ-state, JTF-state, and JTF-civil support). The size and composition of the liaison officer team are determined by the HRF commander.  3-21.   The incident command liaison officers are the bridge between the incident command staff and the CERFP/HRF C2 element. The liaison officers provide the information necessary to coordinate between the two entities. This coordination is done via data or voice communication. 3-22.  HRFs establish and maintain liaison officers with the supported state (JFHQ-state or JTF-state) as soon as they are authorized. HRF liaison officers also—   Coordinate  joint  reception;  staging,  onward  movement;  and  integration  and  employment requirements for the CERFP/HRF.   Advise  the  JFHQ-state/JTF-state  on  the  capabilities,  limitations,  and  appropriate  or  optimal employment of the HRF and other DOD CBRN units. 3-23.  The JFHQ and JTF of the supported state authorizes direct coordination between the CERFP/HRF C2 element and the appropriate level within the incident command. Once authorized, the CERFP/HRF C2 element  establishes  and  maintains  liaison  officers  with  the  incident  command  until  the  transition  of authority. CERFP/HRF liaison officers establish the timelines for task force arrival, operations, logistics locations, and other employment and sustainment considerations at the incident site. HRF liaison officers coordinate  with  the  weapons  of  mass  destruction-civil  support  team  and  CERFP  commanders  and  the incident commander for situational awareness of the incident. 3-24.  The  JFHQ  and  JTF  of  the  supported  state  provide  liaison  officers  to  the  incident  command  for coordination of all-hazards support and the HRF for situational awareness and support. 3-25.  The  common  operational  picture  for  the  HRF  and  states  within  the  region  allow  real-time information sharing. Regionally, the HRF establishes which common operational picture is used to ensure the most effective method of information sharing. CAPABILITIES AND PLANNING 3-26.  Several conditions frame CERFP/HRF operations. They include the following:   The CERFP/HRF capabilities can be requested by local, state, or federal officials to assist in the accomplishment of incident commander lifesaving objectives or to augment other planned or on-site response forces.  3-4 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 CERFP/HRF C2    The  CERFP/HRF  (state  active  duty  or  32  USC  status)  operates  within  a  supporting  modular configuration when requested through the state emergency management system. (C2 plus search and extraction, C2 plus decontamination, C2 plus medical). MISSION VALIDATION 3-27.  When the CERFP/HRF commander receives the mission, it has already been validated through the JFHQ or joint operations center state. It is essential that accurate information is available to ensure that the request is understood, the mission is adequately defined, and the CERFP/HRF commanders have adequate information  to  develop  the  required  unit  risk  assessments.  While  the  mission  has  been  validated,  other questions may arise; and requests for information may be generated at that time. PLANS AND ORDERS 3-28.  The  CERFP/HRF  deployments  may  be  to  initiate  mission  execution  according  to  established timelines  or  to  prestage  an  HRF  as  a  contingency  capability  during  a  special  event.  The  decision  for  a CERFP/HRF  deployment  is  an  operational  decision,  ensuring  that  the  deployment  is  appropriate  and needed. It is the responsibility of the JFHQ-state that controls the CERFP/HRF to publish plans and orders. 3-29.  The  CERFP/HRF  deployments  are  accomplished  using  an  operation  plan,  warning  order,  or operation order according to the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System, JP 3-0, and JP 5-0. If more planning time is available, an operation plan with an effective conversion date to an operation order is used to deploy a CERFP/HRF capability. If less time is available, a warning order is issued and followed by  an  operation  order  within  24  hours.  Intermittent  fragmentary  orders  are  used  to  modify  or  update operation orders. It is the responsibility of the JFHQ-state controlling the CERFP/HRF to publish plans and orders.  To  expedite  the  JFHQ  deployment  of  the  CERFP/HRF,  orders  may  be  issued  verbally  and confirmed in writing. 3-30.  States coordinate the authorization of liaison officers and provide guidance to deploy and receive the CERFP/HRF. The state has the responsibility of issuing the deployment order. The JFHQ and JTF of the supported state has the responsibility for joint reception; staging, onward movement; and integration. 3-31.  The  deployment  of  the  CERFP/HRF  also  initiates  cost-capturing  mechanisms.  The  commander  is responsible for capturing information pertaining to personnel, vehicles, equipment used, and costs incurred that can be used for reimbursement in the event of a presidential declaration of disaster. This information is most likely included in a close-out report. JOINT INTELLIGENCE PREPARATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND INCIDENT AWARENESS AND ASSESSMENT 3-32.  The  intelligence  staff  section  (J-2),  intelligence  staff  officer  (G-2),  or  Air  Force  intelligence  staff officer  element  of  the  CERFP/HRF  headquarters  should  be  qualified  and  responsible  for  providing  the CERFP/HRF  commander  with  the  required  intelligence  and  the  incident  awareness  and  assessment expertise  and  support.  During  CERFP/HRF  operations,  the  primary  tasks  of  the  CERFP/HRF  G-2, intelligence staff officer are incident awareness and assessment (including requests for the appropriate use of supporting military imagery capabilities) and joint intelligence preparation of the environment.  3-33.  JFHQ  J-2  personnel  should  be  qualified  and  responsible  for  providing  the  CERFP/HRF  and  the adjutant general with intelligence and incident awareness and assessment expertise and support regarding the  CERFP/HRF  mission.  JFHQ  J-2  personnel  also  convey  classified  reports  and  information  from  the National Guard Bureau G-2 to the CERFP/HRF G-2,  intelligence staff officer, or Air Force intelligence staff officer element when the HRF headquarters does not have the organic Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications  System  or  Secret  Internet  Protocol  Router  Network  capability  to  receive  reports  and information at a given level of classification.  26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 3-5 Chapter 3  3-34.  The National Guard Bureau J-2 provides state and territory JFHQ and the CERFP/HRF headquarters with  timely  reports  (derived  from  intelligence  community  sources)  on  the  current  enemy  tactics, techniques,  and  procedures  for  the  employment  of  CBRN  weapons  and  also  provides  indicators  and warnings  of  imminent  CBRN  attacks  against  the  U.S.  homeland.  The National  Guard  Bureau  deploys  a joint incident awareness and assessment team, when required, to assist the CERFPs/HRFs in providing the CERFP/HRF  commander  with  robust  intelligence  and  incident  awareness  and  assessment  expertise  and support. 3-35.  National  Guard  intelligence  elements  should  not  perform  intelligence  collection  activities  against U.S.  persons  and  other  human  targets  unless  they  are  explicitly  given  that  mission  by  the  Secretary  of Defense in compliance with intelligence oversight regulations and the privacy rights of U.S. persons. All information on U.S. persons that is not required for the CERFP/HRF mission or that has been incidental is deleted or transferred to agencies with the authority to retain the information. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SUPPORTING HIGHER HEADQUARTERS 3-36.  The National Guard Bureau J-2—   Transmits timely intelligence reports on the current enemy and also advisary tactics, techniques, and  procedures  for  the  use  of  CBRN  weapons  to  the  state  and  territory  JFHQ  and,  when possible, directly to the CERFP/HRF J-2, intelligence staff officer, or Air Force intelligence staff officer elements.   Transmits indicators and warnings regarding impending CBRN attacks on the U.S. homeland to state and territory JFHQ.   Coordinates with the National Guard Bureau personnel directorate of a joint staff and with the force structure, resource, and assessment directorate of a joint staff to identify and plan for the resources required to deploy a joint incident awareness assessment team in support of an HRF.   Coordinates  with  the  National  Guard  Bureau  J-37  to  identify  the  joint  mission-essential  tasks that drive the individual and collective training of the HRF J-2, G-2, or Air Force intelligence staff officer elements to provide intelligence and incident awareness and assessment support to the HRF commander. The National Guard Bureau J-2 should be prepared to provide advice on the preparation of related portions of the training and evaluation outlines and on HRF individual and collective training plans. 3-37.  The CERFP state and territory JFHQ-state—   Ensures  that  the  JFHQ-state  J-2  personnel  are  trained  to  support  the  CERFP/HRF  and  the adjutant  general  in  incident  awareness  and  assessment,  joint  intelligence  preparation  of  the environment,  the  handling  of  classified  intelligence  community  reports,  the  disclosure  of information to civil authorities, and intelligence oversight. Identifies,  to  the  National  Guard  Bureau  J-2,  shortfalls  in  intelligence and  incident  awareness and  assessment  support  capabilities  so  that  the  National  Guard  Bureau  J-2  can  work  with CERFP/HRF  states  in  coordination  with  other  National  Guard  Bureau  joint  staff  sections  to identify possible means of addressing the shortfalls. 3-38.  The HRF supporting the state and territory JFHQ-state—    Ensures  that  the  JFHQ-state  J-2  personnel  are  trained  to  support  the  adjutant  general  in  the handling  of  classified  incident  command  reports,  the  disclosure  of  information  to  civil authorities, and intelligence oversight.

Requests by law enforcement and other incident response partners for the support of National Guard intelligence  assets  are  directed  through  normal  JFHQ-state  director  of  military  support/DSCA  channels. Such  intelligence  assets  are  considered  to  be  subordinate  to  the  agency  partner  mission  and  not  the CERFP/HRF mission. 3-40.  The CERFPs/HRFs and JFHQ-state coordinate with the National Guard Bureau J-2 for assistance in processing the proper-use memoranda for the domestic use of military imagery. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 3-7 This page intentionally left blank.    Appendix A Fatality Search and Recovery Team Fatality  search  and  recovery  teams  provide  a  lifesaving  force  multiplier  since  the deceased  need  to  be  removed  and  turned  over  to  authorities.  Having  a  trained, embedded team ensures that this responsibility does not take away from the primary mission  of  other  elements.  Conducting  a  dignified  and  technically  executed  search and recovery is also significant because the way casualties are treated has a profound and long-lasting effect on the mental health of responders and survivors. Fatalities at an incident site are handled according to local jurisdiction and the scope and tempo of the rescue operation. The fatality search and recovery team is a modular Air Force capability that operates with a CERFP or HRF as required.  ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES A-1.  The  role  of  fatality  recovery  operations  is  supported  by  the  fatality  search  and  recovery  team element.  Fatality  search  and  recovery  team  capabilities  are  detailed  in  Air  National  Guard  Instruction (ANGI)  10-8101,  JP  4-06,  JP  3-41,  Air  Force  Instruction  (AFI)  34-242,  TG  195,  and  National  Guard Regulation (NGR) 500-1. A-2.  The CERFP/HRF deploys a fatality search and recovery team to an incident site according to the unit procedures. The task of the fatality search and recovery team is to conduct search and recovery of fatalities in a CBRN environment and to transport human remains to a designated collection point. Fatality search and  recovery  teams  are  not  trained,  equipped,  or  manned  to  independently  identify,  process,  or decontaminate human remains. A-3.  The fatality search and recovery team may be activated by itself or as an element of the CERFP or HRF in response to a CBRN incident mass fatality operation that uses support to domestic local, state, or federal agencies. The primary role of the fatality search and recovery team is the search and recovery of fatalities  from  a  CBRN  environment  to  the  on-scene  human  remains  collection  point.  In  its  modular capability, multiple fatality search and recovery teams may be deployed to a single incident based on need. CERFP  incident  site  fatality  management  includes  the  location,  documentation,  recovery,  collection, temporary staging, and transport of fatalities to the designated fatality collection points within the incident site.  ORGANIZATION AND LEADERSHIP A-4.  The fatality search and recovery team consists of a C2 element and search and recovery personnel postured  within  ANG  force  support  squadrons.  The  C2  element  consists  of  an  officer  and  an  enlisted member, who provide a critical liaison communications capability between the C2 element lead and the fatality search and recovery team leader. The fatality search and recovery team member mix of sustainment services, flight airmen, and an officer provide the CERFP with the fatality recovery capability to conduct searches  in  a structurally  stabilized  area.  They  also provide  documentation,  temporary  staging, removal, and  transport  of  fatalities  from  the  contamination  or  incident  site  to  an  on-site  collection  point  for processing. Multiple fatality search and recovery teams may be tasked together or separately, depending on the nature and size of the incident. Figure A-1, page A-2, shows an organization chart and the hot-zone operations. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 A-1 Appendix A  Legend: CERFP FSRT HRF ICS NCOIC OIC TOC chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives enhanced response force fatality search and recovery team homeland response force incident command system noncommissioned officer in charge officer in charge tactical operations center Figure A-1. FSRT organization chart and hot-zone operations  A-5.  The fatality search and recovery team consists of the following:   Leader. The leader coordinates fatality search and recovery team activities and communicates with the C2 element.   Tactical  collection  team.  The  tactical  collection  team  is  employed  to  conduct  operations  in warm- and cold-zone environments. The tactical collections team makeup is at the discretion of the team leader. A-6.  The  fatality  search  and  recovery  team  leader  can  be  embedded  in  the  CERFP/HRF  and  fatality management  branch  tactical  operations  center  to  coordinate  fatality  search  and  recovery  requirements. Primary  communication  between  the  team  leader  and  the  tactical  collection  team  is  necessary.  Fatality search  and  recovery  teams  need  the  ability  to  communicate  internally,  directly  with  the  search  and extraction  element,  and  with  other  elements.  The  leader  receives  and  relays  briefings  before  recovery operations, detailing the following:                                                                                                                                                           Situational awareness.   Environments.   Resources.   Communication and reporting procedures.   Known or estimated number of fatalities.   Legal authorities.

Personnel safety.    CBRN and hazmat.   Threats.   Commander’s critical information requirements.   Objectives. CAPABILITIES AND PLANNING  A-7.  The  fatality  search  and  recovery  team  capability  includes  the  location,  documentation,  recovery, short-term storage, and transport of human remains from the recovery site to the on-scene fatality collection point prescribed by the fatality management branch. Upon notification, human remains can be recovered from  the  medical  and  decontamination  processing  point.  Fatality  search  and  recovery  team  operations consist of a fatality search and recovery team liaison officer based in the tactical operations center, a base of operations in the cold zone, recovery site operations, and a short-term or limited-capacity human remains collection point (which is used before decontamination of the human remains pouch). LOCATIONS A-8.  The fatality search and recovery team is trained and equipped to operate in a CBRN environment in any  climate,  though  some  additional  equipment  is  required  to  support  operations  in  extreme  heat,  cold, high-altitude, or wet environments. CONSTRAINTS A-9.  The  fatality  search  and  recovery  team  mission  is  limited  by  the  number  of  personnel  available  to conduct  operations.  This  places  constraints  on  the  expected  throughput  of  remains  by  the  incident commander. This issue may be further complicated due to adverse weather conditions that can raise stress levels, reduce work-rest cycles, and slow processing times. A-10. Mission execution can be hampered by the disqualification of team members for medical screening reasons  during  operations.  Fatality  search  and  recovery  team  members  are  susceptible  to  post  traumatic stress disorder symptoms due to handling high volumes of human remains. This situation reduces fatality search and recovery team capabilities for the period of time that personnel are disqualified. Fatality search and recovery teams receive pre- and postcritical incident stress management support by assigned religious support team personnel. Note.  Due  to  personnel  limitations,  the  fatality  search  and  recovery  team  operational  site  is limited to the immediate area of operations to ensure the maximum effectiveness of resources. EMPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS A-11. Fatality  recovery  includes  interaction  between  CERFP/HRF  elements.  The  fatality  search  and recovery team relies primarily on information reported from other elements through the tactical operations center to recover remains.  A-12. The fatality search and recovery team element depends on the incident command system and JTF for support  during  operations,  including  field  feeding,  lodging,  and  coordinated  movement  activities.  When properly  equipped,  the  staged  fatality  search  and  recovery  team  has  self-sustaining  capabilities  but  uses sustainment support for periods longer than 72 hours. A-13. The  search  and  extraction  element  is  expected  to  discover  fatalities  during  search  and  extraction operations.  Search  and  extraction  fatality  discoveries  are  reported  to  the  tactical  operations  center  by  a member  of  the  search  and  extraction  element  to  facilitate  fatality  recovery  by  the  fatality  search  and recovery  team.  The  search  and  extraction  element  may  also  need  to  move  the  fatality  to  facilitate  the preservation  of  life  or  as  otherwise  directed  by  the  incident  commander.  In  these  cases,  the  search  and extraction  element  only  moves  fatalities  to  the  extent  necessary  to  continue  operations  to  preserve 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 A-3 Appendix A  appropriate collection efforts by other responsible parties and to move fatalities that are located in confined spaces  to  an  area  accessible  by  the  fatality  search  and  recovery  team.  When  reporting  fatalities  to  the tactical operations center, the search and extraction element makes every effort to provide the location and to determine if the fatality is intact or dismembered. A-14. Medical element personnel are embedded with the search and extraction element. They attempt to determine viable life and to make decisions based on available information regarding the status of a fatality at the incident site according to triage protocol. The medical element is expected to encounter casualties that  expire  during  medical  triage,  decontamination,  or  follow-on  medical  processing  and  to  make  death determinations. Should a death occur during medical triage or follow-on medical processing, a notification is made through the tactical operations center to request fatality transport from the processing line by the available fatality search and recovery team. A competent medical authority or designee is responsible for making death determinations for fatalities. A-15. Decontamination  element  personnel  are  expected  to  encounter  fatalities  during  decontamination operations.  Should  a  death  occur  during  decontamination,  a  notification  is  made  through  the  tactical operations center to request fatality transport from the processing line by the available fatality search and recovery  team.  Fatality  search  and  recovery  teams  may  also  need  assistance  from  the  decontamination element in determining the decontamination requirement on the exterior of human remains pouches. A-16. The fatality search and recovery team relies on the incident command fatality management branch for the effective transfer of remains and the clearing of temporary storage capabilities. This interaction is fundamental  to  the  success  of  the  fatality  search  and  recovery  team  operation  by  ensuring  that  remains staging capabilities are not overwhelmed. FATALITY SEARCH AND RECOVERY REQUIREMENTS A-17. The fatality search and recovery team uses the ability to communicate by voice with the CERFP C2 element. The fatality search and recovery team uses the ability to communicate directly with search and extraction  to  support  search  and  extraction  efforts.  The  fatality  search  and  recovery  team  reports  and receives assignments from the CERFP tactical operations center. The fatality search and recovery team uses communication equipment that includes hands-free devices, is water-resistant, can be decontaminated, and has  high-quality  voice  modulation  and  voice  amplification  when  conducting  operations  with  possible barriers  and  while  wearing  PPE.  The  search  and  extraction  element  uses  voice  communication  for coordination  with  the  CERFP  C2  element  and  other  organizations  that  work  within  the  immediate environment. A-18. Fatality search and recovery teams must interface with fatality management branch civilian entities according  to  the  National  Incident  Management  System  and  the  incident  command  system.  Fatality management  operations,  including  search  and  recovery  requirements,  can  vary  as  each  jurisdiction  may apply the incident command system differently. In most instances, it is the local or state medical examiner or  coroner;  but  in  some  instances,  an  interim  medical  examiner  or  coroner  representative  may  be established. DOD personnel note that the medical examiner or coroner have jurisdictional authority over the decedent only and work closely with law enforcement agencies that have jurisdictional authority over the crime scene. Fatality search and recovery teams are trained in search and recovery based on Air Force mortuary  affairs  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures.  When  providing  search  and  recovery  support  to civilian authorities, Fatality search and recovery teams tailor the response based on the local jurisdiction. A-19. Fatality  search  and  recovery  team  operations  may  be  deployed  on-site  as  the  responsible  fatality recovery element at the discretion of the incident commander and the CERFP/HRF commander. Fatality search  and  recovery  teams  may  be  used  as  a  mortuary  augmentation  force  to  an  on-scene  fatality management branch under the incident command system (such as a disaster mortuary operational response team,  a  medical  examiner,  or  a  county  coroner)  or  as  follow-on  DOD  10  USC  status  mortuary  affairs support. A-20. Recovery  is  likely  to  become  the  primary  mission  in  sustainment  operations.  Once  the  rescue operation transitions to recovery, it is expected that most personnel are to augment the fatality recovery operation  to  meet  the  incident  commander’s  expectations.  Fatality  search  and  recovery  teams  have  the ability to train and oversee augmentees in basic search and recovery operations. A-4 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Fatality Search and Recovery Team  PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH A-21. The physical and emotional health of personnel is a primary concern in fatality search and recovery team operations. Fatality search and recovery team members are continually monitored for physiological and psychological stress. If members show stress, it must be addressed immediately. It is recommended that  members  participate  in  emotional  counseling  and  receive  training  to  effectively  cope  with  a  mass fatality incident. INTEROPERABILITY A-22. The  fatality  search  and  recovery  team  deployment  from  the  home  station  is  coordinated  with  the JFHQ-state, JTF-state, the respective wing commander, and the CERFP/HRF commander. Integrating the fatality search and recovery team into the CERFP/HRF and the flow of operations requires the—   CERFP/HRF  tactical  operations  center  to  coordinate  the  phased  employment  of  the  fatality search and recovery team.   CERFP/HRF,  incident  commander,  and  lead  federal  agency  to  coordinate  safety  and  control measures.   Leader to be added to the CERFP advance echelon.   Fatality  search  and  recovery  team  to  provide  mission  planning  support  to  the  CERFP/HRF response and incident commander objectives. A-23. It  is  important  to  understand  that  individual  states  have  unique  laws  that  relate  to  recovering, transporting, and processing fatalities. In most states, the medical examiner and coroner are liable for the operations associated with the identification, processing, and disposition of fatalities. Fatality search and recovery  team  members  coordinate  with  the  CERFP/HRF  tactical  operations  centers  to  ensure  that responders adhere to these requirements. COLD-ZONE OPERATIONS A-24. Fatality search and recovery team cold-zone tasks include base operations, temporary staging, team regeneration,  warm-zone  prestaging,  and  within-zone  fatality  transportation.  The  fatality  search  and recovery team base of operations houses the team leader and prestaged recovery equipment. The tactical collection team leader directs fatality search and recovery team tactical operations from the base operations location. A-25. The  fatality  search  and  recovery  team  base  operations  location  is  determined  by  the  CERFP  with incident  commander  input,  but  may  be  established  within  the  CERFP  incident  site  in  stand-alone operations. It can also be in a separate location from the CERFP incident site, depending on the location of a civilian fatality collection element. WARM-ZONE OPERATIONS A-26. Once  directed,  fatality  search  and  recovery  teams  don  the  appropriate  level  of  PPE  (including equipment necessary to conduct warm zone tasks) and enter the site via designated entry and control points. Fatality  search  and  recovery  team  warm-zone  capabilities  include  temporary  staging,  fatality,  effects recovery,  and  movement  to  a  designated  fatality  collection  point.  Warm-zone  operations  depend  on  the incident site, but efforts are taken to set up away from the view of casualty processing. The first fatality search and recovery teams on-scene are responsible to set up operations. If possible, operations remain in place until equipment id decontaminated. FATALITY RECOGNITION A-27. It is expected that most fatalities are discovered during search and extraction operations in the warm zone.  Fatality  recognition  during  search  and  extraction  operations  is  primarily  based  on  the  CBRN  and atmospheric environment at the incident and may take any form that establishes the viability of life to the best ability of the qualified medical personnel who are with the search and extraction element. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 A-5 Appendix A  A-28. Once a fatality is discovered, medical personnel or another responsible team member appropriately mark  the  fatality  for  future  collection  by  the  fatality  search  and  recovery  team  element  and  notifies  the tactical operations center with the grid location and fatality number. FATALITY RECOVERY AND COLLECTION A-29. Fatality  search  and  recovery  teams  are  capable  of  conducting  tasks  at  a  single  location  and conducting  concurrent  recovery  tasks  with  search  and  extraction  elements.  Fatality  search  and  recovery teams  are  not  confined  space-certified  and  are  not  able  to  recover  remains  from  confined-space  and collapsed-structure environments. For the teams to recover these remains, search and extraction elements need to be employed to extract fatalities and move fatalities that are located in confined spaces to an area accessible by the fatality search and recovery team.  A-30. Fatality search and recovery teams are capable of recovering intact and dismembered remains and personal effects. Fatality search and recovery teams recover remains based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures outlined in AFI 34-242 and Air Force handbook (AFH) 10-247. When providing search and recovery support to civilian authorities, fatality search and recovery teams tailor the response based on the local jurisdiction. A-31. Recovered fatalities are turned over to the fatality management branch under the incident commander as soon as possible. This transfer includes the remains reference number. It is attached to the remains bag to ensure  that  collected  photographs  and  data can be  matched up with  the remains  after  the  information  is transferred during the chain of custody. TEMPORARY STAGING A-32. The fatality search and recovery team has the capability to temporarily stage remains in warm and cold zones for a limited time with adequate refrigerated storage capability. Cold-zone temporary staging is only to be used when no other on-scene civilian human remains storage is available. In these cases, the fatality  search  and  recovery  team  maintains  the  capability  to  temporarily  stage  remains,  while  awaiting transportation from the off-site civilian human remains collection element. A-33. Warm-zone  temporary  staging  may  be  employed  if  no  existing  warm-zone  staging  is  present  or known  to  exist  at  the  time  that  the  first  remains  are  located.  Warm-zone  temporary  staging  of  remains provides a critical capability to collect and stage remains while awaiting the decontamination of the human remains pouch. Decontamination is performed out of the sight of survivors. FATALITY TRANSPORT A-34. Fatality search and recovery teams have the responsibility for remains transport within the incident site  warm  and  cold  zones.  The  fatality  search  and  recovery  team  does  not  transport  remains  off-site.  If needed, transportation from cold-zone temporary staging is provided by the supporting agency. A-6 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013  Appendix B Religious Support Team JP  1  states  that  military  commanders  are  responsible  for  providing  for  the  free exercise  of  religion  of  those  under  their  authority.  Religious  support  teams  are assigned to the C2 elements to provide timely and comprehensive religious support for  task  force  members.  Religious  support  teams  bring  unique  specialty  and counseling skills to a CBRN incident that can mitigate the devastating effects on task force team members and other civilians operating in hot, warm, and cold zones. JP 1-05 defines the concept of religious affairs as consisting of two major capabilities of chaplains:   Religious  advisement  is  the  practice  of  informing  the  commander  on  the impact of religion on joint operations including, but not limited to: worship, rituals,  customs  and  practices  of  U.S.  military  personnel,  international forces, and the indigenous population (JP 1-05).   Religious support is a chaplain facilitated free exercise of religion through worship, religious and pastoral counseling services, ceremonial honors for the  dead,  crisis  intervention,  and  advice  to  the  commander  on  matters pertaining to morals, ethics, and morale as affected by religion (JP 1-05).  SUPPORT PRACTICES B-1.  Religious  support  team  tasks  and  proficiencies  are  broadly  described  as  providing  direct  religious support  to  assigned  personnel  and  advising  the  command  on  the  appropriate  strategic,  operational,  and tactical  universal  joint  task  list  responsibilities  that  relate  to religion  and religious  support.  This  support includes  spiritual  care,  pastoral  care,  morale  assessment,  behavioral  health  preventative  care  assistance, intervention, assessment, treatment, and the referral of task force members suffering from CBRN incident fatigue and stress-related issues. Commanders ensure that personnel within their command are ready to face impending  dangers  and  stress  factors  associated  with  continuous  consequence  management  and  incident command  support  operations.  Serious  stress  factors  can  include  acute  emotional  reactions,  accumulative stress reactions, survivor guilt, and provider fatigue. B-2.  Religious support teams consist of a chaplain and chaplain’s assistant who are trained to assist the CERFP  commander  in  addressing  the  effects  of  sustained  casualty  search  and  extraction  emergency medical  triage,  the  treatment  of  nonambulatory  and  ambulatory  casualties,  and  the  recovery  of  fatalities during consequence management operations. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES B-3.  Religious  support  teams  are  involved  in  disaster  ministry,  including  planning  and  support  before, during,  and  after  the  incident.  Specifically,  the  Chaplain  Corps  mission  is  accomplished  through  the religious support functions of nurture the living, care for the wounded, and honor the dead. These mission sets are applicable to echelons of religious support team response to CBRN incidents. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 B-1 Appendix B  NURTURE THE LIVING B-4.  In preparation for DCSA operations, religious support teams develop and provide religious support activities to strengthen and sustain the spiritual and emotional resilience of CERFP members. During JTF-state and CERFP response operations, religious support teams bring hope and strength to those who have been wounded or traumatized in body, mind, or spirit. B-5.  Religious support teams assigned in support of the CERFP mission are trained to operate in CBRN incident  site  areas,  including  hot,  warm,  and  cold  zones.  However,  the  unit  procedures  for  the religious support team are to operate primarily in the cold zone. The cold zone is where communication among the CERFP C2 element, the incident command, nongovernmental organizations, first responders, and family members is achieved. Selected religious support teams (with proper training, certification, equipment, and command direction) may also be tasked to provide limited religious support in the warm zone. Religious support team warm-zone activities could include hot-zone casualty reception and support to medical triage, mass  casualty  decontamination,  and  mortuary  affairs  operations.  It  is  not  recommended  that  religious support  teams  enter  the  hot  zone,  but  they  should  be  prepared  to  provide  religious  support  to  those personnel operating within the hot zone. CARE FOR THE WOUNDED B-6.  Religious support teams provide religious support through spiritual and emotional care, comfort, and hope to the casualties classified as critically injured, expectant, or dying. This focus of religious support affirms  the  sanctity  of  life,  which  is  at  the  heart  of  the  religious  support  team.  Through  ministry  of presence,  the  religious  support  team  provides  personnel  with  courage,  comfort,  and  faith  in  the  face  of death. HONOR THE DEAD B-7.  Our nation honors military, fire and rescue, and law enforcement first responders who have died in giving  service  to  others.  Religious  support  teams  honor  the  dead  through  funerals,  memorial  services, ceremonies, rites, and rituals that emphasize the worth and value of the individual. Religious support teams conduct these services and ceremonies, fulfilling a vital role in rendering tribute to those who have paid the ultimate price while serving the nation in the defense of freedom (see FM 1-05 for more information). AUTHORITY B-8.  The  First  Amendment  of  the  U.S.  Constitution  guarantees  the  free  exercise  of  religion.  Chaplains traditionally  accompany  U.S.  forces  to  assist  joint  force  commanders  in  providing  for  the  right  of  free exercise of religion to personnel. (10, USC, Sections 3547 and 6031 provide authority for religious support team  activity.)  Religious  support  teams  deploy  during  CERFP  operations  for  the  primary  purpose  of providing  religious  support  to  authorized  DOD  personnel,  operating  under  the  authority  of  the  incident commander, who are conducting cold, warm, and hot zone operations. B-9.  The  Establishment  Clause  of  the  U.S.  Constitution  and  current  DOD  legal  guidance  prohibit chaplains from providing religious support to civilians. However, during catastrophic, large-scale disasters, local and state capabilities (including spiritual care) may be overwhelmed. In these situations, Religious support teams may serve as a liaison to nongovernmental organizations and faith-based organizations when directed by the joint forces command. B-10. Religious  support  teams  normally  do  not  provide  religious  support  to  persons  not  affiliated  with responding military forces. However, incidental support may be provided to nonmilitary persons during the execution of an authorized mission when the following criteria are met:   The  support  is  individually  and  personally  requested  in  an  emergency  situation,  whereby  the need is immediate, unusual, and unplanned.   The  needs  are  acute.  Acute  needs  are  those  which  are  of  short  duration,  prone  to  rapid deterioration, and in need of urgent and immediate care. The necessary provision of last rites is the clearest, but not the only example of such needs. B-2 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Religious Support Team    The  requested  support  is  incapable of being  reasonably  rendered  by  clergy  members  who  are unaffiliated with military response forces. Time, distance, and the state of communications may require that such a determination be made on the spot by the chaplain, based on the information available at the time.   The support is actually incidental. Such support incurs no incremental monetary cost and does not significantly detract from the primary role of the religious support team. B-11. The religious needs of non-DOD-authorized personnel would normally be met by civilian ministers operating in the area. The American National Red Cross assumed this responsibility in the past, but more recently, the task has been delegated to another organizations. B-12. In the joint operational area, additional restrictions may be imposed by the joint forces command. The  imposition  of  such  restrictions  could  hold  significant  implications  for  clergy  access  to  temporary morgues or medical treatment facilities. In some cases, the JFHQ, JTF commander, or incident commander may ask the religious support team to serve as a liaison with local, faith-based organizations and clergy to ensure that the religious and emotional needs of non-DOD personnel are properly addressed. RELIGIOUS SUPPORT TEAM CONSIDERATIONS B-13. The  religious  support  team  operates  from  the  CERFP/HRF  C2  elements.  The  chaplain  serves  the commander as a personal staff officer to plan, synchronize, and coordinate comprehensive religious support and advisement within the area of operations. Comprehensive religious support includes pastoral acts, rites, services, ceremonies, sacraments, ordinances, worship, pastoral counseling, and trauma event management. The  JTF  religious  support  team  is  the  immediate  technical  supervisor  for  assigned  or  attached  religious support teams. B-14. Commensurate  with  the  commander’s  guidance  and  other  DSCA  mission  requirements,  specific religious ministry support missions are conducted to support personnel and JFHQ and JTF-state operation plans. Mission requirements may involve the application of chaplain specialty skills and activities. B-15. Operationally, religious support teams would be assigned to unit C2 elements to provide timely and comprehensive religious support for unit members and integration with injured civilians. Religious support teams  may  also  be  assigned  to  specific  mission  sets  as  determined  by  the  National  Guard  Coordination Center  or  the  JTF  commander.  Religious  support  teams  bring  critical  incident  stress  management specialties  and  counseling  skills  to  the  CERFP  at  a  CBRN  incident  that  enables  unit  commanders  to mitigate short- or long-term stress effects on unit members who are operating in the cold, warm, and hot zones of a CBRN incident site. B-16. Religious support team support provides spiritual care; pastoral care; morale assessment; behavioral health preventive care and intervention assistance, assessment, and treatment; and the referral of JTF-state and  CERFP  members  who  demonstrate  fatigue  and  critical-incident,  stress-related  symptoms.  During mission analysis and course-of-action development, commanders ensure that personnel are ready to face the  reported  hazards,  traumatic  injuries,  and  stress  factors  associated  with  continuous  consequence management support operations (Oklahoma City bombing, World Trade Center collapse). Acute emotional reactions, accumulative stress reactions, survivor guilt, and provider fatigue are serious stress factors that can affect mission capabilities and CERFP readiness. B-17. A  religious  support  team  supporting  a  CERFP  (32  USC  status  or  state  active  duty)  operation  is composed  of  a  chaplain  and  chaplain’s  assistant  who  are  trained  to  support  the  CERFP  C2  element  in addressing the stresses associated with sustained casualty search and extraction, medical triage, treatment, the decontamination of severely injured persons, and the recovery of fatalities during CBRN civil support operations. RELIGIOUS SUPPORT TEAM REQUIREMENTS B-18. Religious support teams use voice communications with CERFP/HRF C2 elements and with other CERFP elements to manage religious support team assets in the area of operations. The religious support team also needs to coordinate directly with faith-based organizations and other nongovernmental agencies to coordinate support for assigned team members. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 B-3 This page intentionally left blank.    Appendix C Medical Element Medical element personnel are responsible for minimizing health risks and providing the emergency treatment of CBRN-related injuries for CERFP/HRF personnel and the civilian population. The medical element is one of four operational elements within each CERFP. When deployed as part of or with an HRF, emergency treatment may  expand  to  include  HRF  personnel,  especially  the  casualty  assistance  support  element  while  in  direct support  of  the  CERFP.  Certain  positions  in  the  medical  element  conduct  operations  in  hot,  warm,  and  cold zones. Specifically, the medical element coordinates with the casualty search and extraction element to provide situational-dependent, emergency medical triage and emergency medical care in a contaminated or collapsed-structure environment. The medical element can be deployed modularly with C2 support in the event of an all-hazards disaster.  ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES C-1.  The mission of the medical element is to conduct mass casualty medical triage, initial stabilization for transport, and force health protection for CERFP/HRF members. Treatment priorities for the CERFP medical element include the—   Treatment of CERFP/HRF personnel and other response force personnel.   Treatment of casualties who are being processed and evacuated through the CERFP/HRF area of operations.   Treatment  of  others  as  directed  or  required  (it  is  not  the  intent  of  this  team  to  be  a  general medical resource at the disaster site). C-2.  The medical element may be required to work in coordination with disaster medical assistance teams under the auspices of the National Disaster Medical System. The assignments and capabilities of disaster medical assistance teams are described in the National Response Framework. The local medical systems and  the  National  Disaster Medical  System  are  the  primary  providers  of general  medical  care  to disaster patients.  The  CERFP  medical  element  provides  initial  stabilization  and  prepares  casualties  who  need additional  medical  treatment  for  transport  and  evacuation  to  definitive  care.  This  is  to  be  the  standard practice under the CERFP concept of operations and the incident action plan to ensure the sustainment of the CERFP mission that supports the incident commander. Decontaminated casualties who show no signs and  symptoms  can  be  provided  medical  care  in  an  appropriate  civilian  or  military  treatment  facility. Casualties processed by the CERFP are tracked through the CERFP area of operations by using a tracking and accountability system. ORGANIZATION AND LEADERSHIP 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 C-1 Appendix C  C-3.  Figure C-1 is an example of an organizational chart for the medical element. Figure C-1. Notional medical element organization C-4.  The medical element leader is responsible for managing and supervising the medical function of the CERFP.  The medical  element  leader  reports  directly  to  the  CERFP  commander,  the HRF,  or  other  task force commander. The medical element leader—   Advises  the  incident  planning  section  on medical  issues  for  incident  action  plan  development and  supervises  the  implementation  of  medical-specific  tasks  when  the  incident  action  plan  is approved.   Provides  personnel  to  address  the  coordination  of  medical  activities  with  the  incident commander’s general staff positions (operations, planning, logistics, administrative/finance) and the CERFP C2 element.   Ensures that medical personnel maintain situational awareness of mission changes.   Supervises medical specialists and ensures adherence to safety procedures.   Maintains required medical records and reports.   Liaisons with other incident response medical entities.   Performs additional tasks or duties as assigned by the CERFP C2 element, HRF C2, or other task force commanders.   Briefs medical personnel on the incident, hazards, and CERFP mission.   Briefs the incident commander, if requested, on the health risks associated with the incident. CAPABILITIES AND PLANNING  C-5.  To properly treat patients and CERFP/HRF responders, the medical element must be composed of qualified  ANG  medical  personnel.  For  sustained  operations  (more  than  24  hours),  the  medical  element needs to be augmented by follow-on medical forces. Air Force specialty code substitutions are according to unit code mission capability statements and the Wartime Mobilization Plan 1. C-6.  The medical element can be deployed in a variety of environments, including CBRN-contaminated and  natural-disaster  environments.  Medical  element  operations  consist  of  phases  to  ensure  timely  and effective  mission  support.  The  medical  element  participates  in  CERFP/HRF  primary  staff  actions,  such as— Incident action plans.    Operation orders.   Strategic and tactical mission updates. MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS C-7.  The medical element may need direct access to resources (telemedicine, the medical control center, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the regional hospital services status). The medical element coordinates with the CERFP C2 element for communication requirements. C-2 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Medical Element  C-8.  The  medical  element  uses  voice  and  data  communications  with  other  CERFP/HRF  elements  to adequately perform triage in hot and warm zones. Communications are needed to—   Report and track the casualty line status.   Report and track the number of persons processed.   Report and track the medication and supply status.   Access inventory and patient databases.   Research CERFP C2 element safety issues.  C-9.  In  addition  to  these  reports  and  tracking  requirements,  the  medical  element  also  needs  to  print assessments  and  charts  that  accompany  casualties  which  are  transported  to  hospitals.  In  the  hot  zone, personnel  use  hands-free  devices  that  are  water-resistant,  can  be  decontaminated,  and  have  high-quality voice  modulation  and  voice  amplification  when  conducting  operations  with  possible  barriers  and  while wearing  PPE.  The  medical  element  uses  voice  communications  with  the  CERFP  C2  element  and  other agencies and organizations working within the immediate environment for coordination. Note.  Medical  element  databases  should  comply  with  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and Accountability Act. C-10. Medical element tasks include—   Medical triage.   The initial stabilization of casualties for transport.   Medical search and extraction.   Guidance to the CERFP commander.   Force health protection for CERFP/HRF members.  26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 C-3 This page intentionally left blank.    Appendix D Decontamination Element The CERFP decontamination element provides decontamination capabilities for mass casualty,  ambulatory,  nonambulatory,  and  technical  decontamination  after  a  CBRN incident.  ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES D-1.  The CERFP decontamination element responds to and provides mass casualty decontamination for CBRN  incidents  and  support  to  local,  state,  and  federal  agencies  who  manage  the  consequences  of  the incident. It  is  critical  for  the  decontamination  element  to  maintain  fluid  operations because  they  are  the transitional point between the search and extraction and medical elements. ORGANIZATION AND LEADERSHIP D-2.  Decontamination can deploy as part of the HRF, as a CERFP, or to augment or relieve in place a decontamination element in another FEMA region. If deployed as an HRF, the decontamination element works closely with the casualty assistance support element for site security.  SUSTAINMENT D-3.  The decontamination element deploys with supplies to process casualties. Environmental conditions and  long-term  operations  use  proper  work-rest  cycles  for  assigned  personnel  and  may  use  additional response assets (CERFPs or a chemical-biological incident response force) to sustain extended operations. For a large-scale CBRN event, an additional CERFP is notified to respond as a relief in place.  PERSONAL EFFECTS COLLECTION/AID AND LITTER SUPPORT D-4.  The personal effects collection section is manned by decontamination personnel. Medical personnel do the initial medical assessment, and then decontamination personnel assign a number to the casualty and collect  personal  belongings (tagged with  a  matching number)  and place  them  in  an onion  bag.  Personal belongings  are  placed  in  the  hazardous-waste  site  according  to  the  incident  commander’s  guidance. Additional  information  is  collected  in  the  cold  zone.  Decontamination  personnel  then  direct  ambulatory casualties to ambulatory tents or perform litter carry for nonambulatory casualties. AMBULATORY CASUALTIES D-5.  A  casualty  who  is  triaged  as  ambulatory  is  physically  and  mentally  capable  of  walking  and performing  self-decontamination.  These  individuals  are  instructed  by  the  decontamination  personnel through  the  entire  process  and  are  assisted  only  when  necessary.  If  the  individual  becomes  injured  or mentally distressed to the point at which they are not able to continue the process, they are moved to the nonambulatory lane. NONAMBULATORY CASUALTIES D-6.  A casualty triaged as nonambulatory cannot walk through the ambulatory line for whatever reason (injury, illness, physical or mental incapacitation). Decontamination is conducted by the decontamination element, and the patient is moved by litter through the decontamination corridor. Care is exercised with each individual casualty to prevent further injuries. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 D-1 Appendix D  TECHNICAL DECONTAMINATION D-7.  Technical  decontamination  is  the  most  flexible  of  the  decontamination  lanes.  The  technical decontamination  lane  is  used  to  decontaminate  military  and  civilian responders  as needed.  The personal effects  of  casualties  are  processed  through  technical  decontamination  as  required  or  instructed  by  the incident commander. MOBILE DECONTAMINATION TRAILER/RAPID RESPONSE D-8.  The  mobile  decontamination  system  can  be  used  for  ambulatory,  nonambulatory,  and  technical decontamination operations. It can be set up and functional with minimal manpower and can be used as a stand-alone decontamination site or used to replace one lane within the decontamination site. The mobile decontamination trailer can be used for rapid-response decontamination for small-scale CBRN events or when time is of the essence. LOG-OUT STATION D-9.  The  log-out  station  records  the  casualty  number  and  identifies  the  casualty  as  ambulatory  or nonambulatory;  additional  information  may  be  required by  the  incident commander.  Personnel  track  the number of outgoing casualties to ensure that personnel entering the decontamination lane have exited and are transported to the medical station. MAINTENANCE (POWER AND WATER) D-10. Without electricity and water, the CERFP mass casualty decontamination site cannot operate. Upon arrival at the incident site, decontamination element maintenance personnel run the hoses and electric lines required to make the site operational. Throughout the mission, these personnel are ready to troubleshoot problems as they arise and maintain the equipment that provides these valuable services. Maintenance tasks include—   Establishing a water source (hydrant, tanker, other industrial water supply).   Running water lines to decontamination lanes.   Establishing  and  monitoring  solid  and  liquid  waste  sites  (as  outlined  by  the  incident commander).   Coordinating for the removal of solid and liquid waste.   Running electric lines to decontamination components.   Maintaining pumps and generators. SUPPLY AND LOGISTICS D-11. The logistics section is responsible for establishing, tracking, and maintaining logistics support for the decontamination operation before, during, and after incident. This support includes, but is not limited to, equipment resupply, fuel, batteries, and health and welfare items. DECONTAMINATION REQUIREMENTS D-12. The decontamination  element  uses voice  communications to  communicate  internally  and  to report the  status  to  the  CERFP  C2  element.  They  use  hands-free  (with  high-quality  voice  modification),  water-resistant equipment that can be decontaminated. D-13. Factors that are considered for decontamination element employment, upon receipt of the mission, include—   Response  time.  Units  maintain  proper  accountability  and  contact  with  CERFP  members  to ensure  quick  recall  once  they  are  alerted.  It  is  expected  that  advance  echelon  personnel  will depart within 4 hours of the alert, with the main body departing within 6 hours of the alert.   Maneuver. Determine the route and alternate routes to the incident location.   Agent. Determine the type of decontamination required and the contact time. D-2 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Decontamination Element    Location. Space availability determines the type of set decontamination configuration.   Injury  type  and  number.  Ambulatory  versus  nonambulatory  patients  and  throughput  may determine the type of setup.   Water  source.  Significant  amounts  of  water  are  needed  for  continuous  operations.  Drawing from a hydrant is the preferred method; however, the use of water tankers or water blivets may be used with adjustments in configuration and attachments.   Temperature. Cold weather increases the potential for hypothermia for patients. Temperature also has adverse effects on equipment. Cold weather significantly degrades operations due to wet equipment freezing and slick areas developing where water accumulates. Heat raises the body temperature of individuals wearing PPE, increasing their potential for heat-related injuries and degrading their ability to sustain operations for extended periods of time.   Wind  direction.  The  wind  direction  affects  site  selection  and  setup.  Site  selection  and  setup need to occur upwind of the hot zone.   Security.  Perimeter  security  is  required  for  entry  and  exit  into  the  decontamination  area  and entry control points.   Hazardous-waste disposition. The removal of solid and liquid waste is coordinated through the incident command according to local, state, and federal regulations.   Equipment. The decontamination element uses detection equipment to check for chemical and radiological contamination on patients and military and civilian responders while they are in the decontamination line. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 D-3 This page intentionally left blank.    Appendix E Search and Extraction The  organization  of  the  National  Guard  CERFP  and  HRF  includes  a  search  and  extraction  element.  This capability is focused on the response to a CBRN incident and differs from traditional urban search and rescue capabilities such as FEMA task forces. The search and extraction element is designed to respond quickly with a relatively  light  equipment  package  and  to  operate  at  structural-collapse  incidents  or  ordinary  construction incidents as described in National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1670. This section describes ordinary construction as being comprised of light frame, unreinforced masonry, and reinforced masonry. The search and extraction element conducts tasks in a CBRN-contaminated environment while wearing PPE up to Level C as described in 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.120. The authority having jurisdiction is defined in NFPA 1670 for CERP/HRF in–state, active duty status or 32 USC is the Chief, National Guard Bureau. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES E-1.  The  role  of  the  search  and  extraction  element  is  to  support  local,  state,  and  federal  agencies  by conducting casualty search and extraction operations and extraction operations in a CBRN-contaminated environment. The element can conduct light operations, which includes rescues at incidents involving light-frame  and  heavy-wall  construction,  low-  and  high-angle  rope  rescues,  and  limited  confined-space operations. Confined-space operations may be limited by the equipment (mandatory 5-minute escape, self-contained  breathing  apparatus  ability)  required  to  conduct  initial  site  entry  per  Occupational  Safety  and Health Administration (OSHA) 1910.120(c)(5)(ii). Additionally, elements of the CERFP can conduct basic operations in a nonstructural collapse or nonstructural entrapment environment. ORGANIZATION AND LEADERSHIP E-2.  The  search  and  extraction  element  configuration  is  flexible  and  can  be  determined  by  mission requirements. The search and extraction element consists of element leadership and subordinate squads and teams,  with  a  medic  in  each  squad.  Depending  on  the  situation,  coordination  with  additional  resources (behavioral  health  care  professionals,  religious  support  teams)  may  be  required  in  operations  involving civilians. CAPABILITIES AND PLANNING E-3.  The search and extraction element is a light, mobile, highly trained rescue element that is capable of moving rapidly to a disaster scene to locate and extract casualties. The element is designed to support local emergency  response  agencies  during  the  first  24  to  72  hours  (Tier 2  response)  of  operation.  During  the rescue  phase,  life  safety  is  typically  the  primary  incident  commander  concern.  Medical  personnel (emergency medical technician B, minimum) embedded in the search and extraction element are trained to operations  Level  1  instructural-collapse,  confined-space,  and  rope  rescue  according  to  NFPA  1670. Depending on the situation, the employment of heavy equipment (mounted power tools and wheeled and tracked  vehicles)  can  be  restricted.  The  search  and  extraction  element  is  equipped  to  operate  within  a CBRN hot zone. The search and extraction element typically receives direction in the hot zone from local agencies, although internal reporting requirements and directives can be expected to remain in place. It is feasible that extraction personnel work hand in hand with local authorities; firefighters; hazmat teams; and other local, state, and federal agencies. Recovered casualties can be delivered to decontamination assets or casualty collection points that are established by the incident commander. As life safety concerns diminish, the rescue phase of operations transitions to the recovery phase, encompassing nonemergency operations carried  out  by  responders  to  retrieve  property  or  human  remains.  Recovery  operations  are  typically supported by additional federal resources. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 E-1 Appendix E  E-4.  The CERFP search and extraction element is capable of conducting light structural-collapse search and rescue. The team uses tools and techniques to quickly secure a structure and enters it to locate and rescue casualties or items of national significance. The element maintains the unique capability of operating in a hazardous environment that requires up to Level C PPE. E-5.  Operational safety concerns may include—   Site assessment and site safety plans.   Modified work and rehabilitation cycles.   Environmental monitoring techniques. E-6.  If contamination is suspected, an initial site assessment is conducted by qualified personnel (such as the  weapons  of  mass  destruction-civil  support  team  or  civilian  hazmat  team)  before  the  deployment  of CERFP elements or teams into the warm or hot zone. CERFP personnel do not enter the warm or hot zone if it is determined that Level C PPE is insufficient for personal protection. E-7.  While  it  is  important  to  describe  capabilities  under  the  National  Incident  Management  System-compliant  terminology,  it  is  fully  understood  and  accepted  that  search  and  extraction  element  capability was  designed  to  augment  state  and  local  emergency  response  assets.  Limited  resources  are  available  to respond to atypical, catastrophic incidents by Tier 1 and 2 response agencies, particularly if the incident includes  CBRN  release  or  weapons  of  mass  destruction  use.  Examples  of  this  atypical  response  are  the mega tornado outbreak seen in Oklahoma in 1999, the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York City, and the Haiti earthquake of 2010. These incidents included widespread damage that impacted Tier 1 response assets; while responsive, mobile, and nonstandard, Tier 2 assets demonstrated that they can affect incident outcomes  by  saving  lives,  property,  and  the  environment.  When  deployed,  the  search  and  extraction element  reports  through  appropriate  channels  to  the  local  incident  commander  and  provides  a  unique capability to local and state response agencies. E-8.  The  search  and  extraction  element  does  not  operate  in  an  unknown,  contaminated  environment. Standards  and  procedures  for  hazmat  operations  meet  existing  regulatory  guidelines  and  follow  safe operating practices for contaminated environments. E-9.  No single federal, state, or local government agency has the capability to respond independently and mitigate  the  consequences  of  a  large  disaster  or  incident.  The  search  and  extraction  element  may  be required to conduct operations at multiple locations. PLANNING E-10. Upon arrival at the incident site, the CERFP search and extraction element—   Provides input to the site safety plan.   Coordinates  with  weapons  of  mass  destruction-civil  support  team  and  hazmat  teams  or  other support agencies for containment identification.   Formalizes posture and risk assessment for employment.   Sets  up  and  maintains  an  initial  emergency  decontamination  line  to  allow  the  emergency decontamination of the search and extraction element members.    Facilitates the rapid deployment of search and extraction assets if an existing decontamination site is not in place by other agencies for use. Emergency decontamination is used for responders in the absence of the technical decontamination line. E-11. Domestic incidents often use extensive searches of multiple city blocks to complete site assessment and identify additional casualties. This mission is well suited for search and extraction elements because of their  light  equipment  and  smaller  vehicles.  Other  sections  of  the  CERFP  task  force  (such  as  the decontamination  element)  can  be  used  for  search  and  extraction  element  operations,  provided  that  the incident  does  not  need  their  capabilities  elsewhere.  Search  and  extraction  elements  implement  search assessment marking systems according to NFPA 1670 or incident commander directives. E-2 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Search and Extraction  LOCATION E-12. Clearing the area for the area of operations is critical. Site analyses factors help determine the area of operations location and size. E-13. The search and extraction element may need structural engineer support for collapsed structures. The search  and  extraction  element  deploys  with  a  minimal  amount  of  building  material  and  relies  on  the incident command system or military channels for resupply. E-14. Sustainment  operations  need  an  intermittent  resupply  of  expendables.  They  may  also  need  area lighting for nighttime operations. The search and extraction element may use heavy machinery and wheeled and tracked mounted equipment at a collapse sight. SEARCH AND EXTRACTION OPERATIONS E-15. The search and extraction mission uses specialized equipment in the hot zone to communicate with other teams operating in the hot zone as needed and depending on operational necessity. E-16. The search and extraction element communicates at the incident site via hands-free devices that are water-resistant,  can  be  decontaminated,  and  have  high-quality  voice  modulation  and  voice  amplification when conducting operations with possible barriers and while wearing PPE. The search and extraction uses voice communication for coordination with the CERFP C2 element and other agencies and organizations that work within the immediate environment. E-17. Members of the search and extraction element can conduct the following tasks:   Level I rope rescue per NFPA 1006, Section 6.1.   Level I confined-space rescue per NFPA 1006, Section 7.1.   Level I structural-collapse rescue per NFPA 1006, Section 9.1. E-18. Team  leaders  (a  minimum  of  five  members  per  search  and  extraction  element)  can  conduct  the following tasks:   Level II rope rescue per NFPA 1006, Section 6.2.   Level II confined-space rescue per NFPA 1006, Section 7.2.   Level II structural-collapse rescue per NFPA 1006, Section 9.2. E-19. The  search  and  extraction  element  is  trained  and  equipped  to  provide  the  following  operational capabilities according to NFPA 1670:   Rope rescue at the operations level.   Structural-collapse search and rescue at the operations level, with the exception that the search and extraction element is not expected to meet the following requirements:   Operations level for vehicle search and rescue.   Operations level for trench and excavation search and rescue.   Operations level for machinery search and rescue.   Confined-space search and rescue at the operations level.   Water search and rescue at the awareness level. E-20. The  search  and  extraction  element  leaders  ensure  the  operational  readiness  and  availability  of mission  equipment  sets  (shoring  materials,  hand-tools,  rope  equipment,  visual  inspection  and  listening devices, air monitoring equipment). E-21. As required (following the CERFP or incident commander’s situation update briefings), the search and  extraction  element  leader  has  the  responsibility  of  tailoring  CERFP  extraction  mission  planning assumptions  based  on  the  new  information.  The  safety  of  search  and  extraction  element  members  is paramount. Mission planning support is provided by the requesting and supported organization. E-22. The  search  and  extraction  element  operates  in  support  of  local  incident  command  objectives.  The incident command safety inspectors and other emergency responders located at the incident may or may not have  completed  structural  surveys  of  collapsed  or  confined  areas  in  which  extraction  operations  are 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 E-3 Appendix E  conducted; therefore, an assigned safety officer performs safety officer (under the direction of the incident command safety officer) duties. Standards and procedures for hazmat operations are according to existing regulatory  guidelines  and  safe  operating  practices  for  CBRNE-contaminated  environments.  The  incident may affect single or multiple locations, each of which may be a disaster scene or a hazmat inhalation threat. E-23. The  search  and  extraction  element  uses  a  site  safety  plan  generated  by  the  supported  incident command organizational structure or the established safety structure designated by the CERFP commander. E-24. Operational concerns that need to be included in the site safety plan include—   Site assessment.   CERFP work-rest cycle development and implementation.   Medical surveillance. E-25. Upon  arrival  at  the  incident  site,  the  search  and  extraction  element  coordinates  with  the  incident commander or the incident commander’s operations and planning sections to provide technical expertise on how to most effectively employ the element. The search and extraction element may be tasked to develop a search plan specifically for their team according to the incident action plan that is already in place. Search and extraction element leaders can begin their planning process when the CERFP C2 element has received the  incident  commander’s  objectives  for  CERFP  support  and  the  search  and  extraction  element  leaders know the specific objectives for their element. E-26. While the search and extraction element remains a critical mission set, there are many employment factors and references (unit procedures, NFPA, Code of Federal Regulations [CFR]) that are considered before and during deployment to an incident site. They include, but are not limited to—   Site analysis. When conducting a site analysis, consider the following:   Weather. Weather is a critical consideration, and plan flexibility is needed. Wind direction affects  the  location  and  proximity  of  the  area  of  operations  and  the  decontamination corridor. Humidity and temperature can positively or negatively affect search and extraction elements.  Extreme  humidity  and  temperature  reduce  the  duration  time  of  team  member exposure  to  CBRN  hazards  and  the  amount  of  time  that  the  element  can  remain  in  PPE. CBRN hazards react to humidity and temperature. The higher the temperature of a liquid, the  higher  its  vapor  pressure.  Humidity  can  depress  an  agent,  causing  it  to  lie  dormant, ultimately deceiving hazard detection.   Terrain. Terrain analysis is critical for the advanced party to identify key locations so that each  element  and  team  can  establish  the  area  of  operations.  The  location  of  the  area  of operations reduces potential obstacles, low areas, and limited access and egress.   Hazards.  The  search  and  extraction  element  avoids,  protects,  and  mitigates  hazard  effects  to reduce risk. The following must be considered when dealing with hazards:   CBRN hazards can be the most lethal hazard at an incident.   Utilities (gas, water, electricity) need to be controlled or terminated before deploying to the incident site.   The severity of the collapse dictates deployment to the incident site.   Engulfment, entrapment, and exposure to a hazardous atmosphere in a confined space are hazards in a collapsed-structure incident. Secondary detonation, explosion, or collapse after the initial incident are possible hazards.    Risk. The search and extraction element avoids, protects, and mitigates hazard effects to reduce exposure and PPE and to more clearly define the parameters of acceptable versus unacceptable risks:   Acceptable  risks.  Acceptable  risks  are  risks  that  team  members  have  the  capability  of mitigating by actions or procedures alone (for example, the potential of a collapse).    Unacceptable risks. Unacceptable risks are risks that the teams do not retain the capability to avoid, protect, or mitigate against the effects of the given hazard (for example, exceeded operational exposure limits).   PPE. The potential CBRN hazards determine the PPE level. Search and extraction personnel, at a minimum, wear gloves, a hard hat, safety glasses, elbow and knee pads, and steel-toed boots E-4 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Search and Extraction  per the unit procedures and the site safety plan. In a CBRN environment, wear appropriate PPE according to the site safety plan.   Time.  To  maximize  the  effectiveness  of  manpower  and  equipment,  rotations  are  scheduled according to established work-rest cycles, weather conditions, and the incident action plan. For continuous operations, a second or third search and extraction element is required. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 E-5 This page intentionally left blank.    Appendix F Casualty Assistance Support Element The  casualty  assistance  support  element  provides  protection  and  support  to  the CERFP/HRF  C2  elements.  The  primary  role  for  the  casualty  assistance  support element is to facilitate the throughput of the CERFP decontamination team, casualty control,  and  movement  operations.  Their  duties  transition  between  casualty movement, protection, and crowd control within the CERFP/HRF area of operations based on the situation. Priority is always given to protecting CERFP/HRF personnel.  ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES F-1.  The  casualty  assistance  support  element  provides direct  support  to  the CERFP/HRF response  to  a CBRN  incident  in  the  form  of  protection  as  its  primary  role,  while  assisting  with  other  tasks  such  as casualty movement and crowd control as directed to ensure mission success.  F-2.  The effects of a catastrophic event may exceed the ability of local officials to respond to the incident. Security may be required to facilitate decontamination operations and to protect CERFP/HRF personnel, other responders, and evacuees. If the HRF C2 element and CERFP are not collocated, the priority of effort is  to  support  the  CERFP.  The  casualty  assistance  support  element  can  conduct  split  operations;  but  as mentioned earlier, the priority of effort is to assist and provide security for CERFP elements. The casualty assistance  support  element  can  operate  in  cold,  warm,  and  hot  zones.  Additional  security  requirements beyond  casualty  assistance  support  element  capabilities  are  requested  through  the  incident  command system or JTF-state. ORGANIZATION AND LEADERSHIP F-3.  The casualty assistance support element is generally composed of a headquarters and infantry and military  police  platoons.  Figure  F-1,  page  F-2,  is  an  example  of  a  casualty  assistance  support  element organizational chart. F-4.  The casualty assistance support element uses a sustainment capability to operate concurrently with multiple  CERFPs  for  a  continuous  period  of  time.  The  following  analysis  provides  employment considerations  for  planning  only.  The  actual  employment  of  the  casualty  assistance  support  element  is based on the needs of the CERFPs. Casualty assistance support element tasking within the HRF is assigned by the HRF commander. F-5.  The casualty assistance support element platoon leader is responsible for managing and supervising the  HRF  protection.  The  casualty  assistance  support  element  platoon  reports  directly  to  the  HRF commander and is responsible for—   Providing advice on protection issues for incident action plan development and supervising the implementation of protection-specific tasks after incident action plan approval.   Ensuring that support personnel maintain situational awareness of mission changes.   Supervising support personnel and ensuring adherence to safety procedures.   Providing liaison activities with other incident response support entities.   Performing additional tasks and duties as assigned by the HRF commander.   Briefing support personnel on the overall CBRN mission.   Briefing the incident commander, if requested, on protection risks associated with the incident.   Maintaining the accountability of assigned equipment to fulfill mission duties. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 F-1 Appendix F  Legend: CASE CERFP  HRF HQ PL PSG QRF RTO S T TOC casualty assistance support element chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives enhanced response force package homeland response force headquarters platoon leader platoon sergeant quick-reaction force radiotelephone operator squad leader team leader tactical operations center Figure F-1. Notional CASE organization CAPABILITIES AND PLANNING F-6.  The casualty assistance support element is a general-purpose force that is assigned to assist the HRF, but it is highly likely that the casualty assistance support element operates in warm and hot zones in support of CERFP operations. F-7.  The casualty assistance support element capabilities, at a minimum, are—   Operating in a contaminated area.   Sustaining operations for long periods of time.   Providing protection for the CERFP.   Conducting access control in warm and hot zones.   Providing limited crowd control for the CERFP.   Establishing a limited, quick-reaction force.   Employing weapons (lethal and at least one form of nonlethal). F-2 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Casualty Assistance Support Element  F-8.  The casualty assistance support element operates with the basic understanding of the following:   Operations in a contaminated area greatly reduce troop-to-task ratios.   Close coordination with the site safety officer is necessary to ensure that PPE limitations for the incident working environment are not exceeded.   Support  in  the  warm  or  hot  zone  (beyond  the  scope  of  the  HRF  organic  support  element)  is extremely limited due to the inability of the outside agency to work in a warm or hot zone.   Nonlethal weapon requirements and nonlethal weapons training requirements are not effective until 180 days after receipt of the equipment by the HRFs. CASUALTY ASSISTANCE SUPPORT ELEMENT REQUIREMENTS F-9.  Depending on the situation, a portion of the casualty assistance support element is prepared to deploy with  the  CERFP  within  the  first  hours  of  notification.  The  casualty  assistance  support  element  liaison officer  may  deploy  with  advance  echelon  elements  of  the  HRF  C2  element  to  the  incident  site.  The remainder of the element deploys with the main body to the incident site after notification. F-10. The  casualty  assistance  support  element  deploys  with  individual  weapons.  The  transportation, storage, and use of weapons are according to the rules for use of force, state and federal laws, and other applicable guidance. Consult with the staff judge advocate before issuing weapons.  F-11. The casualty assistance support element uses the capability to escalate the use of force by means of lethal and nonlethal weapons per the rules for use of force established by the supported state. F-12. Casualty assistance support element communications at the incident site use hands-free devices that are water-resistant, can be decontaminated, and have high-quality voice modulation and voice amplification when conducting operations with possible barriers and while wearing PPE. F-13. Duties typically expected to be performed by the casualty assistance support element for the HRF may include—   Conducting limited crowd control.   Providing entry control operations to minimize cross contamination.   Securing casualty movement assistance and direction. Note. HRF commanders must be cognizant of the fact that a decision needs to be made when two or more CERFPs are used regarding the prioritization of casualty assistance support element assets and usage. F-14. Additional duties that may be performed by the casualty assistance support element may include—   Providing protection for the HRF C2 element, fatality search and recovery team, and religious support team.   Securing assets at the staging area. F-15. During postincident and redeployment (demobilization), coordinate the necessary follow-up security task as directed. The HRF C2 element coordinates reporting and accounting requirements for the closing report. Operational losses and potential maintenance issues of protective equipment are to be documented. F-16. Casualty assistance support element personnel are briefed on the mission status and redeployment plan. Personnel are assigned to manage area of operations breakdown and load-up. Assigned weapons and security equipment (including protective equipment) are decontaminated, inventoried, returned to storage, and prepared for transport. F-17. An  internal  after  action  review,  including  mission  critiques,  is  conducted.  The  casualty  assistance support element provides after action review results to the HRF commander during the unit after action review. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 F-3 Appendix F  F-18. Recovery, reconstitution, and resupply actions are conducted to include preparing shortage annexes; conducting financial liability investigations of property loss; reordering commercial and government off-the-shelf equipment and supplies; and making line-of-duty determinations. An action officer is designated and the noncommissioned officer addresses the open actions identified during the after action review. F-4 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013  Appendix G CERFP/HRF Sustainment The  CERFP/HRF  states  have  the  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the  equipment  and expendables  required to  support  CERFP/HRF  operations  are  available  and maintained.  States  and  territories  that  are  unable  to  meet  the  requirements  follow established  request  processes  to  fill  shortages.  Shortages  that  cannot  be  filled  are identified to the National Guard Bureau J-4. Supported states have the responsibility to  provide  supply  and  services  support  once  the  CERFP/HRF  is  deployed  to  their area of operations and organic supplies are depleted. Primary sustainment challenges are  to  anticipate  needs  and  integrate  assigned  elements,  teams,  and  supply  sources into the operation. The CERFP elements, which are deployed independent of an HRF, report  directly  to  the  next  layer  of  C2  identified  in  this  chapter  as  the  senior headquarters on the ground for support requirements. CERFPs that are deployed in conjunction with an HRF report requirements and the status to the HRF C2 element, except during incidents in which direct liaison authorization is given to the incident commander. SUSTAINMENT PLANNING G-1.  The CERFP is designed with minimal internal sustainment capabilities. The HRF provides a more robust  sustainment  capability  within  the  C2  element.  The  CERFP  C2  element  consolidates  support planning of CERFP elements and coordinates with the HRF C2 element (if activated) and with the JTF-state  or  JFHQ-state/plans  staff  section  (if  deployed  independently).  Support  may  be  provided  from  the CERFP/HRF supporting state, National Guard Bureau, or the supported organization or state, depending on the type of support required. It is crucial that this is considered during the planning process by CERFP/HRF C2 elements, the JFHQ-state, and the supported organization or state. State-to-state support agreements are addressed  in  the  planning  phase  during  regional  planning  efforts.  The  required  support  may  include housing,  food,  fuel,  equipment  repair,  expendables  replacement,  and  mission-dependent  requirements (security, communications, legal, chaplain, waste management coordination, work coordination, specialized support).  States  that  do  not  possess  CERFP  coordinate  for  support  by  using  their  FEMA  regional  plan. Prior  planning  during  the  regional  planning  process  is  critical  to  effective  and  timely  sustainment operations during operational periods. G-2.  Military-issued  equipment  and  expendables  are  supported  through  normal  logistics  channels. CERFP-unique commercial, off-the-shelf equipment is supported through the National Guard Bureau J-4 Consequence Management Support Center. The Consequence Management Support Center is activated by the National Guard Bureau J-4 when notified of a CERFP/HRF activation. Procedures are emplaced at state joint operations centers to notify the National Guard Coordination Center of the CERFP/HRF activation to ensure  the  timely  support  of  actions  required  at  the  National  Guard  Bureau  level  to  support  operational units. G-3.  Use National Guard Bureau-Department of Health and Human Services medical cache or ANG Class VIII resupply systems for continued operations. Supplies must be coordinated and received by an on-site medical element logistician. REGIONAL PLANNING G-4.  Regional  planning  is  paramount  to  the  application  of  sustainment  principles  during  CERFP/HRF operations. Regional planning also allows for validation that the support expected from other agencies by responding  units  is  attainable  and  sustainable  upon  arrival.  Prior  planning  is  critical  to  ensure  that 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 G-1 Appendix G  organizations not normally associated with one another and those with potentially different processes and procedures  understand  and  integrate  into  other  systems  that  are  responsive  to  one  another’s  needs. Conducting this planning ahead of time will ensure that the support required for a response provides the greatest economy, is the most simplistic in nature, and is flexible enough to respond to the nuances of the current  operating  environment.  The  more  coordinated  the  regional  plan,  the  more  effectively  the CERFP/HRF planners can execute the plan, reducing response time and increasing effectiveness. G-5.  The JFHQ of the assigned HRF state or territory is responsible for the regional plan, and the J-4, Director  of  Logistics,  U.S.  Army,  for  that  state  is  the  proponent  for  regional  logistics  planning.  The logistics plan is reflective of which organization provides the different classes of supplies and services as operations progress. Requirements to joint reception; staging, onward movement; and integration include potential  locations  upon  deployment  into  another  state  or  territory,  prior  coordination  for  movement requirements  into  and  through  other  states  and  territories,  life-support  arrangements,  and  maintenance agreements. Regional plans are formalized through the use of the EMAC, memorandums of understanding, and memorandums of agreement. ORGANIZATION PLANNING G-6.  CERFP/HRF  logistics  planners  establish  standard  operating  guidance  to  minimize  the  amount  of planning that is required upon mission receipt. Consideration is given to the standard operating guidance that  covers  the  areas  of  air  movement,  line  of  communications  operations,  life-support  operations,  and warehouse and logistics package operations. G-7.  Contingency plans for deployment within the FEMA region are developed based on the regional plan published within the FEMA region. These plans include, but are not limited to, the identification of joint reception;  staging,  onward  movement;  and  integration  sites,  occupation  of  identified  staging  bases,  and integration of plans for follow-on forces that are attached. CONCEPT OF SUPPORT G-8.  The CERFP/HRF is generally self-supporting in Class I, II, III, VI, VII, and IX supplies for the first 5 days.  Class IV  supplies  are  generally provided by  the incident  command  system.  The  Class  V  supply basic load (lethal/nonlethal) is provided by the supporting state, with follow-on ammunition provided by the  supported state  if  required  by  the governor of  the  supported  state. Class  VIII  supplies,  used  to treat service members who are organic to the task force, are generally self-supporting for the first 72 hours. The CERFP  medical  element  deploys  with  a  formulary  established  by  the  National  Guard  Bureau  surgeon’s office, who is also the proponent to provide follow-on formulary when operational stocks become depleted. Life-support services are generally provided by the incident command or the supported state. G-9.  Where  possible,  with  the  exception  of  commercial,  off-the-shelf  and  Class  VIII  supplies  for  the medical element, CERFP/HRF supporting states are responsible for the establishment and maintenance of supply  classes.  States  and  territories  that  are  unable  to  fill  required  items  request  assistance  from  other states and territories and notify the National Guard Bureau of the gaps that exist and the actions that are taken  to  fill  them.  Standard  military-issue  equipment  is  supported  within  established  state  support structures. The National Guard Bureau J-4 establishes the priority for support for nonstandard equipment and fields it through the Consequence Management Support Center. G-10. The  Consequence  Management  Support  Center  activates  the  support  coordination  center  for  24/7 logistics  support  when  directed  by  the  National  Guard  Bureau  J-4.  The  J-4  has  responsibility  for  the resolution  of  logistics  support  request  conflicts  in  coordination  with  the  priorities  established  by  the National Guard Bureau J-3 and the defense coordinating officer in the respective regional field office. The Consequence Management Support Center contacts the National Guard Bureau J-4 for guidance on support priorities when competing requirements exist.  G-11. Standard equipment repair is coordinated through the state National Guard supply and maintenance system. Supported states make their maintenance systems and field maintenance squadrons available to the CERFP/HRFs  that  are  operating  within  their  borders.  HRFs  consider  establishing  limited  organic maintenance capabilities within the C2 elements. G-2 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 CERFP/HRF Sustainment  G-12. Nonstandard  or  mission-unique  equipment  repair  is  done  according  to  the  procedures  in  the Consequence  Management  Support  Center  logistics  support  standard  operating  guidance  and  J-4 coordination.  The  repair  of  General  Service  Administration-provided  vehicles  and  equipment  is coordinated through The General Services Administration and the National Guard Bureau J-4. LOGISTICS SUPPORT REQUEST G-13. The  CERFPs/HRFs  should  attempt  to  fill  requests  through  the  incident  command  system  when possible.  The  following  subordinate  elements  fulfill  requirements  unfilled  by  the  incident  command system:   CERFP C2.   HRF C2. JTF-state.  JFHQ-state.    National Guard Bureau J-4. LOGISTICS STATUS REPORTING G-14. The  National  Guard  Bureau  J-4  establishes  monthly  logistics  readiness  reporting  criteria.  This requirement  can  be  waived  if  the  Defense  Readiness  Reporting  System  can  be  used  to  obtain  the information. CERFP/HRF staffs use incident command system forms when they meet military needs. This minimizes  the  amount of work  required of  subordinate units  and  elements  that  are  required  to  report  to incident  command  system  and  military  systems.  Consideration  is  also  given  to  using  standard  military report formats, such as the logistics readiness tool. G-15. Following mission receipt or a warning order or during the alert or recall, CERFP/HRF units report (through  command  channels)  the  status  of  mission-critical  items  and  the  status  of  CERFP  mission expendables  and  consumables.  Critical  items  are  considered  for  more  intensive  tracking.  Critical  items include, but are not limited to, PPE, filters, chemical tape, bulk water, and formulary. SUPPORTED STATE G-16. Supported states must establish plans to support incoming forces. While the need for joint reception; staging, onward movement;  and integration is understood and valid, the process used should not slow a responding unit from getting to the incident site to save lives and mitigate suffering.  G-17. Plans are developed to support common-user logistics for incoming units within 72 hours of their arrival. These plans are incorporated into the regional planning process. Contracting support, if required, is provided  by  the  supported-state  JFHQ.  The  supported  state  provides  life-support  services  to  incoming forces  if  those  services  are  not  provided  by  the  incident  command  system.  Consideration  is  given  to capturing  the  costs  associated  with  the  deployment  to  appropriately  request  reimbursement  according  to established federal policies and procedures. SUPPORTING STATE G-18. States and territories that accept the mission of establishing a CERFP/HRF must ensure that the task force is fully equipped and maintained according to the equipment lists developed by the National Guard Bureau  J-4.  Supporting  states  provide  infrastructure  and  storage  to  support  the  CERFP/HRF  mission assigned to the state or territory. G-19. The  JFHQ  develops  regional  contingency  plans  within  the  FEMA  region  to  the  greatest  extent possible. These plans consider support relationships in each supply class and when the transition of support would shift. Plans also consider prior planning for movement between and through states.   26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 G-3 Appendix G  NATIONAL GUARD BUREAU REQUIREMENTS G-20. The National Guard Bureau requirements include—   Monitoring the CERFP/HRF assets supply and readiness status (including providing guidance on support  priorities)  in  coordination  with  the  defense  coordinating  officer  and  National  Guard Bureau J-3.   Monitoring CERFP/HRF asset movements into and out of the AO.   Managing  the  acquisition  and  issuance  of  commercial,  off-the-shelf  equipment;  nonstandard equipment; and medical element formulary.   Managing  forwarding  area  support  team  responsibilities  during  CERFP/HRF  response operations.    Providing  technical  expertise  regarding  the  use  and  maintenance  of  nonstandard  and commercial, off-the-shelf equipment.   Providing emergency and help desk operations and technical assistance. CERFP RESPONSIBILITIES G-21. During the planning phase, CERFPs may use normal military procurement channels, including the government  purchase  card,  the  military  standard  requisitioning  and  issue  procedures,  and  contracting  to locally procure expendables and consumables. Requirements for end items and expendables that are not available locally are submitted through state command channels to the U.S. Property and Fiscal Office and the directorate of logistics for action. Organizational maintenance programs ensure that the equipment is calibrated and ready for deployment. G-22. During  operational  phases,  CERFPs  report  logistics  statistics,  logistics  requests,  and  equipment readiness statuses to the HRF C2 element. If deployed independently, reports are forwarded to the JTF-state. The CERFP forwards status reports though the incident commander as required. G-23. The CERFPs returning from deployments or exercises establish equipment readiness and their basic load to preemployment levels as soon as feasible. The CERFP commander contacts the state JFHQ and the Consequence  Management  Support  Center  to  complete  reconciliation  actions.  The  CERFPs  report commercial, off-the-shelf equipment problems to the Consequence Management Support Center help desk and the National Guard Bureau J-4. HRF RESPONSIBILITIES G-24. Communications  operations  are  established  to  manage  logistics  tracking  and  coordination. Communications operations are used to track the status of supplies and services. Critical mission items that need  more  intensive  management,  such  as  suits  and  bulk  water,  can  be  identified.  These  items  are consumable items that, if expended, would halt operations and make the entity non-mission-capable. G-25. Consideration in the selection of logistics personnel is given to those who are dedicated within the air line  of  communications  operations  to  the  identification  of  sources  for  supplies  and  services  to  sustain operations. Contracting personnel are also considered for inclusion in this section. G-26. The C2 element develops methods for receiving supplies in the area of operations and pushes the supplies to the receiving units and elements. Operational, security, medical, decontamination, and search and  extraction  elements  do  not  have  sufficient  organic  supply  personnel  to  support  the  acquisition  and transportation  of  supplies  organically;  and  they  need  the  HRF  C2  element  to  push  supplies  to  them. Materials  handling  equipment  and  transportation  assets  are  a  consideration  when  determining  required equipment packages. G-27. Consideration is given to establishing, within the C2 elements, personnel who manage life-support services for assigned units as they recover and refit. These personnel manage and care for the incident base at which service members returning from a mission come to rest and recover. These services may include the  management  of  Class  I  subsistence,  accommodations,  showers,  sewer  (field  latrines),  limited maintenance, and sick call. G-4 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 CERFP/HRF Sustainment  G-28. HRF C2 elements must consider establishing processes for tracking the movement of incoming units and supplies within their area of responsibility. Once integrated into the organization tracking, managing the  movement  of  units  and  supplies  within  the  area  of  responsibility  is  essential  to  maintain  situational awareness  and  ensure  that  mission  requirements  are  met.  Once  operational  areas  are  established, considerations in movement include whether units move with organic vehicles to and from the rest-and-recovery area or if they are bused in and out to minimize the number of vehicles moving in and out of an incident site. G-29. HRF  C2  elements  are  able  to  establish  and  report  equipment  densities  for  assigned  forces.  The maintenance status of critical pieces of equipment that would cause a unit or element to be non-mission-capable  is  intensively  managed.  Items  considered  for  intensive  management  include  generators, decontamination devices, and communications equipment. G-30. Joint  reception;  staging,  onward  movement;  and  integration  is  the  responsibility  of  the  supported-state JFHQ. HRF C2 elements are responsible for the integration of follow-on forces into operations within their area of responsibility upon their arrival. G-31. When  authorized  and  issued,  military  weapons  and  ammunition  are  maintained  according  to  DA Pamphlet 710-2-1 or Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 31-229 and are available for issue according to AR 190-11; AFI 31-207; and the adjutant general or commanding general. Organizational maintenance programs ensure that the equipment is calibrated and ready for deployment. G-32. Support  during  operations  is  coordinated  at  the  lowest  level.  When  possible,  support  requests  are vetted  through  the  incident  command  to  determine  if  they  can  be  supported  locally  before  requesting through military channels. MOVEMENT G-33. The primary method of movement is by ground convoy. The details of movement planning within and between states are established within the regional plan. The plan includes considerations for convoy clearance, fuel, and maintenance. G-34. The  secondary  mode  of  transportation  is  by  air.  Demand  will  likely  far  exceed  the  capacity.  The CERFP/HRF  C2  elements  work  with  air  transportation  planners  to  develop  contingency  plans. Considerations  are  given  to  developing  packages  to  deploy  mission-critical  equipment  and  personnel, depending on the incident location and circumstances. G-35. Movement  by  rail  and  sea  is  normally  not  used,  as  the  time  taken  to  execute  these  moves  would exceed the window in which the HRF is designed to save lives and mitigate risk. Movement into an area of operations is coordinated with the supported state before the initiation of movement.   26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 G-5 This page intentionally left blank.    Appendix H Planning NATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND GEOSPECIFIC PLANNING Resource  Management  Decision  700  states  that  the  National  Guard  Bureau,  U.S. Northern  Command,  and  U.S.  Pacific  Command  are  responsible  for  developing detailed operational employment plans and working with interagency, state, and local authorities. HRF PLANNING RELATIONSHIPS H-1. During the mission planning process, consider the following— Is there an operational name for the incident?    What type of incident (CBRN, conventional, natural) is it?    What time did the incident occur?   Was it a suspected terrorist or criminal act, or was it perceived to be an accident?   Were pictures obtained of the suspects?   What are the standards for evidence collection or preservation? (Does clothing need to be individually bagged or tagged, or can we mass dispose?)   Are preincident  and  postincident  imagery  of  the  site  available?  If  not,  when  will  they  be collected and provided?   What  is  the  estimated  number  of  casualties,  and  what  are  the  types of  injuries  (blast, CBRN, burns, crush)?   Which CBRN hazards may be involved?   What level of PPE does each CERFP/HRF element and team wear?   What are the concentrations?   What is the exposure duration?   What decontaminant is required?   What are the casualty signs and symptoms?   Are communicable diseases a concern? If so, which ones?   What monitoring is occurring on-site?   What other resources are already on-site or can be expected to arrive? Search and extraction element.   C2 element.   Medical element.    Decontamination element.    Religious support team.   Casualty assistance support element.   Quick-reaction force. Fatality search and recovery team.   What is the alternate site in the event of wind change or a secondary incident?   What is the estimated length of the operation? Is a police escort available for the main body?    Where is the staging area?   Where is the site? 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 H-1 Appendix H    Are the utilities in the hot zone turned off?   What is the emergency medical service status (on-site, staging area, transport plan, triage plan, location)?   What routes are closed for emergency medical services?   Are facilities maps available if search and extraction is required?   What communications capabilities are required? H-2. The incident commander provides and considers the following to the mission, as appropriate:   The commander’s critical information requirements.   The site sketch with hot, warm, and cold zones identified.   The safety plan.   The mission statement.   The type of notification if emergency egress is necessary.   The available clean routes and route closure times. H-3. The Office of the Secretary of Defense and other DOD components have interests in sourcing and resourcing HRF requirements and must have some process by which to periodically assess and support these  plans.  Pivotal  to  HRF  success  is  that  they  are  integrated  into  the  FEMA  regional  planning community  for  CBRN  consequence  management.  Therefore,  the  assignment  of  full-time,  equivalent planners is essential. To be successful, the HRF needs to coordinate planning with FEMA, the National Guard  Bureau,  and  the  JFHQ-state  in  the region  and  state  emergency management  agencies.  The HRF involvement is in separate planning communities, including—   Regional  planning  and  execution.  The  Regional  planning  and  execution  community  is  the planning community that exists within the FEMA region in which the HRF resides. Within the regional planning and execution community, most of the laborious planning effort takes place and results in geospecific plans (plans that are focused on a city, critical infrastructure, or other location) and HRF regional plans.   Enterprise planning and execution. The Enterprise planning and execution community is the U.S. Northern Command-sponsored planning community in which the HRFs (through National Guard  Bureau)  need  to  provide  visibility  and  input.  The  enterprise  planning  and  execution community  generates  national  response  concept  plans  for  each  of  the  HRFs  as  mutually supporting capabilities.   Joint planning and execution community. The Joint planning and execution community is the community in which the National Guard Bureau, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and other DOD stakeholders review the DOD CBRN response enterprise family of plans for sourcing and resourcing. The U.S. Northern Command Concept Plan 3500 is the conduit through which HRF inputs are communicated. HRF PLANNING PRIORITIES H-4. The following are the HRF planning priorities:   Priority  1.  The  HRF  regional  response  plan  is  the  first  priority  of  the  HRF  to  satisfy  the requirements  outlined  in  Resource  Management  Decision  700  and  the  intent  of  the  HRF. Regional  plans  focus  primarily  on  alerting,  assembling,  deploying,  and  employing  the  force within the region with clearly phased objectives, transition criteria, and an end state.   Priority 2.  Each  HRF  is  required  to  produce  a  national  response  plan  as  its  second  planning priority.  The  HRF  National  Response  Plan  articulates  how  an  HRF  alerts,  assembles,  and deploys  in  support  of  other FEMA  regional  response plans.  Moreover,  this  is  not  merely  one plan for HRFs, but rather one plan per HRF that describes in operational detail how they alert; move to an airport of embarkation; deploy by one or more methods of transportation; arrive at the joint reception; staging, onward movement; and integration; and are employed in a different FEMA region to assist with a major national consequence management incident. The national response plan also includes redeployment plans. Planning guidance is given to HRFs to focus on the most likely national targets, such as Washington, D.C., and New York City. H-2 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Planning    Priority 3. The third planning priority for the HRFs is to develop geospecific plans based on the number and priority of targeted population centers and critical infrastructure and key resources within  the  region.  The  prioritization  of  geospecific  plans  are  coordinated  between  the  HRF headquarters, JFHQ-state, National Guard Bureau, and U.S. Northern Command. NATIONAL GUARD HOMELAND RESPONSE FORCE PLANNERS H-5. National Guard HRF planners work within FEMA regions and planners to create geospecific plans in response to threats to urban areas security initiatives cities. JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER/TACTICAL OPERATIONS CENTER PLANNING H-6. The joint operations center considers the following: Is there a fuel point contract established?   Where will we rest?   How will we be fed?    What type of orders will we be on?   Who will cut the orders?   What  does  the  joint  intelligence  preparation  of  the  environment  show  about  the  potential mission? POINTS OF CONTACT H-7. A point of contact is recommended for the following positions:   Medical.   Public works.   Law enforcement.    Hazmat team chief.   Coroner or mortuary representative. Incident site safety officer.  SITE SAFETY AND HEALTH PLAN H-8.

The National Guard Bureau facilitates this coordination, when possible, and maintains situational awareness of state-to-state National Guard support requests and missions. NATIONAL GUARD BUREAU  I-1.  The  National  Guard  Coordination  Center  is  operational  24/7/365  and  has  lead  responsibility  on behalf  of  the  Chief,  National  Guard  Bureau,  for  coordinating  emergency  response  actions  that  support governors,  primary  federal  agencies,  and  DOD  organizations.  This  coordination  is  in  concert  with established  DOD  staffing  processes,  plans,  and  directives  and  is  consistent  with  the  National  Response Framework and the National Incident Management System. PHASE 0 (SHAPE) I-2.  Requests for National Guard support of homeland defense missions received from the U.S. Northern Command, First Air Force, or the Air Force Rescue and Recovery Coordination Center are federal support missions  commanded under  federal  authority.  Units  participating  in  these  missions  are  not  a  part  of  the state JTF-state. I-3.  The  EMAC  provides  a  common  understanding  and  framework  to  facilitate  expeditious  support  to other  states.  The  EMAC  documents  the  legal  authorities,  relationships,  cost  reimbursement,  and responsibilities  of  the  supported  and  supporting  states  ahead  of  the  actual  requests  for  support  and employment of people and equipment. The EMAC can also foster relationships between the CERFP states and other regional states that do not currently have a fielded CERFP capability. I-4.  The National Guard Bureau supports the synchronization of state, regional, geographic, and national CBRN response plans, including the inclusion of dual-status commander options when integrating elements of Title 10 CBRN enterprise elements. PHASE I (ANTICIPATE) I-5.  The National Guard Coordination Center coordinates and synchronizes the deployment of National Guard CBRN forces responding to a CBRN incident that is beyond the capability of the requesting state. PHASE II (RESPOND) I-6.  States notify the National Guard Coordination Center when they alert or deploy forces in support of homeland  defense,  homeland  security,  or  DSCA.  Combatant  commanders,  the  National  Guard Coordination Center,  and  the  U.S.  Transportation  Command  validate  airlift  requirements  and  movement orders as needed. I-7.  Normally,  departing  immediately  by  ground  movement  toward  the  incident  location  is  faster (less than 600 miles) than aircraft coordination, arrival, load planning, and departure. Ground movement may be faster over longer distances depending on the route, road, and traffic conditions in comparison to the time to  stage  an  aircraft,  load  it,  fly  from  the  origin  to  the  destination  airport,  unload,  and  drive  to  the  final destination. The National Guard Coordination Center monitors JFHQ-state deployments at scheduled report distribution  frequencies  and  provides  selected  DOD  and  interagency  organizations  with  a  consolidated situation  report  that  details  unit  departures  and  arrivals  in  support  of  national  special-security  events, DSCA, or EMAC missions.  26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 I-1 Appendix I  I-8.  As  the  units  deploy,  the  National  Guard  Coordination  Center  notifies  the  supported  combatant commanders  and  other  federal  military  authorities  that  the  units  are  deploying,  directs  the  Consequence Management Support Center and the National Guard support center to initiate support for the deploying units  (according  to  existing  plans  and  processes),  and  coordinates  with  the  Defense  Threat  Reduction Agency to provide reachback support. I-9.  The deployment process is described in JP 3-35. Deployment is divided into the following iterative and often simultaneous phases:   Planning.   Predeployment activities.   Movement.  Joint reception; staging, onward movement; and integration.  I-10.  While  adhering  to  joint  doctrine,  the  National  Guard  Bureau  planning  guide  focuses  on  joint reception; staging, onward movement; and integration in the context of National Guard 32 USC or state active duty status. I-11.  The  focus  of  the  National  Guard  Bureau  planning  guide  is  on  joint  reception;  staging,  onward movement;  and  integration  for  deployments  from  one  state  to  another.  There  are  inherent  difficulties  in properly  transferring  the  operational  control,  logistics,  and  C2  involved  in  these  movements.  The sustainment of out-of-state National Guard forces demands attention to detail and thorough accountability in the joint reception; staging, onward movement; and integration process. Joint reception; staging, onward movement; and integration is the essential link between the deployment and employment of joint National Guard  forces  in  the  joint  operations  area  and  a  critical  operational  challenge  enabled  by  logistics.  Joint reception; staging, onward movement; and integration is the primary means to achieve and maintain C2 during deployments. While the state J-3 and J-4 are heavily involved in joint reception; staging, onward movement;  and  integration,  successful  execution  uses  the  combined  efforts  and  cooperation  of  a  state’s entire joint staff and supporting organizations. I-12.  The inherent purpose of the HRF is to provide life-saving capabilities as quickly as possible. The gaining-state  joint  reception;  staging,  onward  movement;  and  integration  processes  must  provide streamlined procedures to accomplish standard joint reception; staging, onward movement; and integration processing of units arriving in the state. Additionally, if the requirements can be done remotely, lifesaving units can go directly to the support site and begin work with limited delay. As much information as possible must be communicated up front before the HRF departs the home station to ensure that they have taken care of administrative, logistical, and medical tasks or bring the required information along that allows for a streamlined  inprocessing  into  the  gaining  state.  When  possible,  immunizations  and  other  medical requirements are addressed in Phase 0 preparations. I-13.  Each  HRF  state  must  address  joint  reception;  staging,  onward  movement;  and  integration standardization  and  efficiencies  within  their  regional,  national,  and  geospecific  concept  plans.  As  a minimum,  states  should  address  medical  credentialing,  frequency  management,  medical  processing  of individuals,  reporting  procedures,  and  contacts.  The  U.S.  Northern  Command,  National  Guard  Bureau, states,  and  HRF  planners  continuously  review  the  joint  reception;  staging,  onward  movement;  and integration plans and guidance and improve the content and standardization between regions. PHASE III (OPERATE) I-14.  Employment considerations include the location, mission constraints, and operational dependencies. When  selecting  a  location,  access  to  ambulance  services  and  air  evacuation  should  be  considered.  Also consider  the  space  for  site  setup  using  shelters  of  opportunity.  When  considering  mission  constraints, consider the—   Ability to house or feed personnel.   Ability to sustain operations for 5 days.  ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013  I-2 Phases of Operations    Coordination with the incident command and tactical operations center for the transportation of casualties.     Oxygen delivery system.   Operational  dependencies  (transportation  of  casualties  in  and  out  of  the  area  of  operations, access and use of strategic stockpiles, procurement of medical supplies and baby formula). I-15.  The National Guard Coordination Center consolidates information about National Guard responses and provides regular and special situation reports to the Army, Air Force, DOD, U.S. Northern Command, U.S.  Southern  Command,  U.S.  Pacific  Command,  U.S.  Army  Forces  Command,  U.S.  Army  North,  Air Force Office of Homeland Security, and Air Force National Security Emergency Preparedness. I-16.  The National Guard Bureau J-3 coordinates with the Consequence Management Support Center and the National Guard support center for the logistics sustainment of deployed CBRNE response forces.  I-17.  As federal agencies begin arriving at the incident site to establish a JTF-civil support headquarters, joint operations center, and tactical operations center, the National Guard Bureau continues to develop and manage  critical  information  requirements  in  support  of  homeland  security  and  federal  agencies  that  are monitoring National Response Framework emergency support functions.  I-18.  The  National  Guard  Coordination  Center  responds  to  requests  from  federal  agencies  asking  to  be added  to  the  National  Guard  Bureau  distribution  of  daily  information  briefing  products  and  other  civil support team and CERFP informational products.  PHASE IV (STABILIZE) I-19.  The  National  Guard  Coordination  Center  monitors  redeployment  and  reports  changes  in  deployed forces  to  the  military  officials  and  other  states.  Redeployment  initiates  requirements  for  after  action reviews, equipment reconciliation, logistics reconstitution, and financial accounting. I-20.  The  JFHQ-state  identifies  and  publishes  state  active  duty  and  32  USC  mission  end-state  and termination  criteria  that  are  appropriate  for  the  disaster  and  scope  of  consequence  management  support operations. The National Guard Bureau coordinates with the supported combatant commander to verify the end-state and mission termination for the CERFP/HRF and other forces supporting 10 USC consequence management operations. I-21.  Geographic  dispersal,  the  magnitude  of  the  response  operation  and  the  political  implications  to sustain response capabilities may drive the decisions of state and local authorities regarding the release of the CERFP/HRF capabilities. Local authorities may be reluctant to release the capabilities that aid them in mitigating  the  disaster  effects.  The  termination  criteria  should  be  discussed  early  in  the  process  and considered  when  local  or  state  agencies  have  sufficient  assets  and  situational  awareness  to  resume  their normal  responsibilities.  When  determined,  the  CERFP/HRF  mission  termination  criteria  should  be documented in the incident action plan and daily situation reports. I-22.  Before  redeployment,  the  CERFP/HRF  should  collect  and  decontaminate  reusable  mission equipment and coordinate with the incident command for contaminated materiel disposal. Decontaminated and monitored equipment is repacked according to the applicable technical directives and load plans. I-23.  The CERFP/HRF units and element leaders participating in the response operations should conduct postmission debriefs and after action reviews where feasible during the redeployment site takedown. These after action reviews are vital for the improvement of subsequent CERFP/HRF response planning actions. I-24.  The CERFP/HRF normally redeploys to the home station by the same method used for deployment or as directed by the JFHQ-state. If federalized, redeployment is coordinated by the supported combatant commander or JTF-civil support. PHASE V (TRANSITION) I-25.  The National Guard Bureau J-3 and J-7 collect after action reviews, documents, and lessons learned and begins the process of updating policy and regulations as required. The after action reviews should be consolidated at the CERFP/HRF headquarters and forwarded through the chain of command to the National 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 I-3 Appendix I  Guard Coordination Center/National Guard Bureau J-3 domestic operations for equipment standardization, C2, and training readiness reviews. I-26.  The  CERFP/HRF  units  returning  to  the  home  station  from  deployment  account  for  equipment (replacing  as necessary)  and  restore  stocks  of  commercial,  off-the-shelf  materials  with  support  from  the Consequence Management Support Center and state logistics organizations. I-27.  The  CERFP/HRF  command  element,  in  coordination  with  the  JFHQ-state  staff,  should  capture incremental and expendables costs. Primary federal agencies can reimburse the state for incremental costs and expendables under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act federal cost-sharing agreement. CERFP/HRF C2 I-28.  The following discussion is provided to establish a baseline of actions and activities for responding to a CBRN incident that uses CERFP/HRF employment. Supported state refers to the state or states that have requested CBRN response forces to assist with lifesaving and the mitigation of human suffering. PHASE 0 (SHAPE) I-29.  During Phase 0, the CERFP/HRF—   Develops and validates a mission-essential task list and prepares the long-range, short-range, and near-term training plans to achieve and sustain individual and collective task proficiency.   Executes  the  training  plans  to  standard  with  rigorous  after  action  reviews  and  retraining  as necessary.    Conducts  the  liaison  activities  necessary  to  ensure  adequate  information  flow  and  familiarity with local, state, and federal officials who may potentially be involved in incidents that have, through the assessment process, been determined as likely to occur.   Develops, rehearses, and exercises the operation plans to support anticipated contingencies.   Develops tactics, techniques, and procedures based on lessons learned from training, exercises, assessments, and liaison activities.   Conducts maintenance on equipment.   Ensures the health and fitness of team members.   Manages personnel and equipment to ensure that the unit is properly postured and configured for rapid response.   Conducts Soldier readiness processing. PHASE I (ANTICIPATE) I-30.  Upon mission notification, the CERFP/HRF commander should initiate alert and recall procedures. Upon receiving the alert or notification, members may be required to confirm receipt of the notification and/or report to the designated assembly areas, adhering to established timelines.  I-31.  During recall or assembly, the CERFP/HRF commander and the element and team leaders conduct a mission analysis (the time between the incident and the support request, casualties, type of incident, chain of command), conduct risk assessments (inhalation, partial collapse), and review load and movement plans. I-32.  The  CERFP/HRF  is  designed  for  self-deployment  via  ground  transportation.  Although  it  can  be transported by aircraft, aircraft availability during a national emergency may be limited. If airlift is deemed to be the most expeditious means for deployment, it should be requested through JFHQ-state. Movement planning should consider primary and alternate routes to the incident, primary and contingency means of transportation,  and  the  time  that  the  CERFP/HRF  is  requested  to  be  on-site  according  to  applicable regulations. These considerations should be balanced against mission-variable considerations.  I-33.  Within notification, the CERFP/HRF advance echelon should be ready to deploy to conduct liaison operations  with  the  incident  commander.  The  CERFP/HRF  commander  should  determine  the  size  and composition of the advance echelon. I-4 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Phases of Operations  I-34.  Units and elements should incorporate these factors into their unit procedures, and issued movement orders should provide specific guidance. PHASE II (RESPOND) I-35.  Upon  arrival  at  an  incident  site,  the  advance  echelon  advises  the  incident  commander  of  the CERFP/HRF  assets,  capabilities,  credentials,  limitations,  and  mission  support  requirements.  The CERFP/HRF C2  element  receives  the  incident  commander  objectives  and  updated  situational  awareness information. Then, based on the incident action plan, the CERFP/HRF C2 element determines how to best support  the  incident  commander.  After  obtaining  the  incident  commander’s  mission  guidance,  the CERFP/HRF  commander  plans  the  employment  of  task  force  elements  to  conduct  operations.  The CERFP/HRF tactical operations center and incident command post establish and maintain communications for the coordinated employment of task force elements and teams in the incident site and/or staging areas. I-36.  If  the  site  security  provided  is  deemed  inadequate  for  the  mission,  the  CERFP/HRF  commander coordinates with the incident commander and the military chain of command for National Guard response force security teams. PHASE III (OPERATE) I-37.  The C2 element provides situation reports according to the mission operation order or as requested by their appropriate headquarters or the incident commander and ensures that logistics and resupply actions are coordinated for the task force. I-38.  Operational  security  needs  to  be  addressed  through  all  phases  of  operation,  especially  during  the operational  phase.  Items  deemed  law-enforcement  sensitive  should  not  be  shared  without  permission. CERFP/HRF members should be briefed on what can and cannot be shared or communicated with others outside the organization. PHASE IV (STABILIZE) I-39.  The  establishment  of  termination  criteria  is  identified  during  the  early  stages  of  the  incident  and through  the  incident  action  plan  and  coordinated  with  the  supporting  military  chain  of  command.  The CERFP/HRF,  in  coordination  with  the  incident  commander,  develops  the  strategy  toward  mission termination. The decision to terminate support is coordinated with the military chain of command, State Emergency Management Agency, the incident commander, and the CERFP/HRF commanders. Once the decision  to  terminate  has  been  made,  the  C2  element  implements  plans  for  terminating/handing  over operations. Factors that influence termination include, but are not limited to—   The completion of the assigned mission.   The arrival of additional military capabilities.   The  arrival  of  additional  civilian  and  commercial  assets  to  support  the  incident  commander’s objectives.   The CERFP/HRF commander’s determination of mission accomplishment. I-40.  The CERFP/HRF tactical operations center develops a termination support plan that may include the following products:  Incident logs.    A site safety plan.   An incident action plan.   Site sketches.   Photographs and videos.   Casualty transport information.   Coordination  with  the  incident  command  for  the  hazardous  item  disposition,  including equipment and contaminated waste.   Deletion of U.S. person information or its transfer to agencies authorized to retain it.   Cost estimates. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 I-5 Appendix I  I-41.  The  incident  commander  or  authorized  representative  is  out-briefed  and  the  required  termination documents are handed over before the CERFP/HRFs departure from the incident site. The CERFP/HRF tactical operations center conducts redeployment coordination to develop a redeployment plan according to the commander’s guidance or unit procedures. I-42.  The  C2  element  provides  guidance  to  the  CERFP/HRF  tactical  operations  center  to  develop termination procedures. The CERFP/HRF tactical operations center subsequently develops the termination plan  for  approval  by  the  commander.  The  CERFP/HRF  tactical  operations  center  coordinates  with  the incident commander’s representatives for any additional resources needed for the disposal of hazmat and for the transfer of responsibility of the decontamination area to the incident command for waste disposal. I-43.  The CERFP/HRF tactical operations center consolidates the data collected during the operation into a historical record of incidents, logs, message traffic, hazard models, pertinent photographs and images, and test result records according to the unit procedures. The task force should, at a minimum, maintain a copy of documentation provided to the incident commander’s representatives. I-44.  The  task  force  should  conduct  a  termination  briefing  with  the  incident  command  system representatives to address the final assessment, which includes a review of the assigned strategic objectives; a  final  analysis;  a  list  of  completed,  incomplete,  or  in-process  objectives;  the  medical  status  report  of casualties; identified safety issues; and lessons learned. Once the incident command system representatives indicate  concurrence  with,  or  approval  of,  the  briefing,  the  task  force  should  coordinate  an  immediate release from the response tasking and continue with the appropriate preparations for redeployment to the home station. PHASE V (TRANSITION) I-45.  The  preparation  for  redeployment  is  performed  according  to  the  unit  procedures,  but  it  should  be coordinated  with  the  incident  command  system  representatives  to  ensure  a  safe  withdrawal  from  the response.  Care  should  be  taken  to  recover  all  equipment  including  Class  II  (clothing  and  individual equipment) and Class VII (major end items) equipment, to reconstitute the unit. Input from each element allows logistics personnel and the CERFP tactical operations center to determine the costs associated with the  incident  and  initiate  appropriate  financial  liability  investigations  for  lost,  damaged,  or  destroyed property. I-46.  The  C2  element  coordinates  with  the  incident  command  system,  military  chain  of  command,  and applicable  response  and  support  agencies  for  authorization  to  redeploy.  The  CERFP/HRF  tactical operations center then receives the redeployment directive from the CERFP/HRF commander and begins appropriate troop-leading procedures, including sensitive-item and communications security accountability. I-47.  The CERFP/HRF tactical operations center redeployment coordination includes obtaining adequate transportation to redeploy the task force if organic capabilities are not adequate. When using transportation other  than  solely  organic  vehicles,  transport  time  and  linkups  should  be  coordinated  and  confirmed  and appropriate documentation should be generated, including manifests and documentation of transportation hazards.  Load  plans  may  need  to  be  adjusted  accordingly  for  the  situation  and  the  selected  mode  of transportation. Joint operation planning and execution system and time-phased force and deployment data movement information are updated as necessary. I-6 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Phases of Operations  I-48.  The  task  force  prepares  personnel  and  equipment  for  movement.  The  CERFP/HRF  tactical operations  center  provides  a  redeployment  order  appropriate  for  the  distance  and  mode  of  travel.  A redeployment  timeline  is  established,  and  appropriate  logistics  support  and  services  are  planned  or coordinated.  Comprehensive  safety  briefings  are  provided  in  conjunction  with  a  redeployment  or movement order. Once the task force returns to the home station, closure reports are submitted according to the unit procedures. I-49.  The  preparation  for  subsequent  operations  should  begin  immediately.  Reporting  and  recovery procedures  (Consequence  Management  Support  Center,  National  Guard  Bureau,  JFHQ-state,  and  unit policy) should be quickly conducted to reconstitute the unit to a mission-capable status. I-50.  After  action  reviews  should  be  completed  and  consolidated  at  the  CERFP/HRF  C2  element  and forwarded through the chain of command.  PHASE 0 (SHAPE) I-51.  Phase 0 is the shape phase and ends with the alert to assemble for a CBRN response. During this phase, the CERFP conducts the individual and collective training necessary to validate its mission-essential tasks. Also during this phase, individuals attend schooling while leaders conduct coordination and planning within the FEMA region to ensure that the CERFP is incorporated into the comprehensive DOD CBRN response enterprise. I-52.  Leaders  and  units  also  participate  in  various  exercises,  from  tactical  to  the  strategic  levels,  to validate, rehearse, and improve the critical tasks of the CBRN response enterprise. Extensive coordination is  ongoing  between  the  CERFP  units,  JFHQ-state,  FEMA,  National  Guard  Bureau,  U.S.  Northern Command, and civil first responders to ensure that state and regional responses are harmonized. Regional CBRN  plans  are  developed,  coordinated,  and  synchronized  between  the  federal,  state,  and  local  levels. Success criteria for this phase of operation are the completion of comprehensive response plans and the sustained validation of the CERFP as a part of the DOD CBRN response enterprise. This phase ends upon alert. I-53.  Key tasks during this phase are training, equipping, exercising, validating, planning, coordinating, ensuring readiness, and securing agreements among governors. DOD CBRN response enterprise elements must  have  a  joint  operation  planning  and  execution  system,  air  movement,  and  time-phased  force  and deployment data developed during Phase 0 and updated in Phases I and II. I-54.  The  CERFP  conducts  the  individual  and  collective  training  necessary  to  validate  its  joint  mission-essential tasks. A training assessment is completed in an external evaluation by the National Guard Bureau  and  U.S.  Army  North.  HRF  is  validated  by  the  adjutant  general  in  personnel,  equipment,  and training.  The  standard  operating  guidance  and  unit  procedures  provides  the  tactical  level  of  detail  for assembly, marshalling, preparations, load out, movement, and actions for employment upon arrival. I-55.  The  CERFP  regional  response  plans,  CERFP  national  plans,  and  CERFP  geospecific  plans  are developed and approved by the CERFP commander and the region adjutant general to facilitate the safe and rapid deployment and employment of CBRN assets to an incident site. Ongoing synchronization of the family of plans between the CERFP, JFHQ, FEMA, National Guard Bureau, U.S. Northern Command, and civil first responders is necessary to ensure that state, regional, and national responses are harmonized. PHASE I (ANTICIPATE) I-56.  Alert and assembly (Phase I if standby or predeployed/Phase II if no-notice) DSCA actions cannot commence without a request from the civil authorities. The initial notification of a catastrophic incident may  come  from  the  JTF  or  joint  operations  center  to  the  CERFP.  The  command  team  gathers  incident details. Priority airlift is requested if needed. When the commander alerts the CERFP, the alert notification plan is implemented to recall team members. Initial contact is made with the incident commander and the emergency  operations  center  by  the  CERFP  commander.  If  federalized,  the  commander  contacts  the regional task force commander for reporting instructions. A deliberate risk assessment and composite risk management worksheet should be completed before the operation. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 I-7 Appendix I  PHASE II (RESPOND) I-57.  The command team maintains the integrity of the unit during ground or air movement to the incident site.  The  commander  communicates  with  the  state,  JTF/joint  operations  center,  and  incident  command leadership  while  en  route  to the  incident.  The  advance  echelon  commander  and  advance  echelon gather available  data  on  the  incident,  response  effort,  and  threat  and  relay  this  information  to  the  CERFP commander and the CERFP main body. I-58.  Upon arrival on-scene, the advance echelon reports to the incident staging area. The advance echelon establishes  communications  with  the  incident  commander  or  his  designated  representative  and  obtains additional guidance  for  CERFP  support. The  incident  commander  retains operational  control of  the  task force, while directly supporting the incident commander incident response actions. The CERFP commander performs liaison with the incident commander and his staff. The incident commander always retains control of the incident site and directs the CERFP commander on the strategic goals to assist with the mitigation of the incident. The CERFP commander ensures that the incident commander’s strategic goals are translated to tactical objectives and operations throughout the response phase using the incident action plan. I-59.  The CERFP should coordinate with the CBRNE forces on the scene and then coordinate with the incident  command  representative.  The  CERFP  should  develop  an  occupation  plan,  which  includes  the priorities of work, based on analyses and civil authority considerations according to the unit procedures. Before  occupation,  the  area  of  operations  should  be  monitored  and  verified  as  safe  for  occupation  and appropriate for CERFP response operations. I-60.  The task force normally occupies the area of operations and prepares to conduct operations according to  the  occupation  plan  and  unit  procedures.  Communications  and  decontamination  operations  are established  and  preoperation  checks  are  performed  (based  on  information  provided  by  the  civil  support team, joint intelligence preparation of the environment, and incident assessment and awareness). I-61.  The CERFP tactical operations center is established and manned according to the unit procedures. Sections within the task force establish their operational areas based on the commander’s guidance, the unit procedures,  and  the  situation.  The  elements  report  equipment  status  to  the  CERFP  tactical  operations center. I-62.  The  medical  element  establishes  medical  surveillance  activities  for  task  force  personnel  before, during,  and  after  team  members  enter  suspected  contaminated  areas.  The  medical  status  of  task  force personnel should be updated and provided to the CERFP tactical operations center throughout the response operation, ensuring that the CERFP commander is aware of any change. Medical element representatives should also conduct briefings that address the signs and symptoms of exposure to the suspected hazard. I-63.  Section  leaders  should  promptly  report  non-mission-capable  equipment  to  the  CERFP  tactical operations  center.  Logistics  or  other  designated  personnel  should  coordinate  the  movement  of unserviceable equipment to a maintenance facility and request appropriate support or replenishment from the  support  contractor  (Consequence  Management  Support  Center)  through  the  CERFP/HRF  tactical operations center according to the Consequence Management Support Center and unit procedures. I-64.  The  task  force  should  select  appropriate  decontamination  locations  to  minimize  the  spread  of contamination. CERFP personnel coordinates with the incident commander to determine the level of PPE necessary and the decontamination procedures required based on the hazard. The maximum PPE available to CERFP personnel is Level C. CERFP members do not enter contaminated areas if PPE requirements exceed  Level  C.  The  CERFP  should  establish  a  decontamination  corridor,  ensuring  that  the  proper procedures  are  in  place,  and  comply  with  the  regulations,  including  CFR  1910.120,  for  the  safety  of CERFP  personnel  and  other  responders.  Decontamination  operations  are  conducted  on  contaminated personnel and equipment according to the site safety plan developed by the incident command system and the  CERFP  safety  assessment.  Decontamination  line  personnel  should  coordinate  with  the  incident command system for the final disposition of decontamination lane liquid runoff and solid waste according to the hazmat emergency operations and state and federal law. I-8 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Phases of Operations  PHASE III (OPERATE) I-65.  The role of the CERFP tactical operations center as a C2 center is critical. As the task force conducts CERFP  operations,  the  tactical  operations  center  should  analyze  information  and  maintain  situational awareness  by  tracking  mission  progress,  maintaining  operational  graphics,  performing  joint  intelligence preparation  of  the  environment,  and  coordinating  incident  awareness  and  assessment.  In  addition,  the CERFP  tactical  operations  center  should  distribute  information  to  the  appropriate  parties;  manage  the chain-of-custody procedures according to the direction of law enforcement authorities, the incident action plan,  and  the  unit  procedures;  issue  appropriate  orders;  post  changes  to  the  commander’s  critical information requirements as directed by the CERFP command element; and submit sustainment reports and situation reports to higher headquarters and the appropriate agencies within the incident command system. The CERFP tactical operations center should also determine the requirements and decision points necessary for requesting follow-on response forces and resources. I-66.  The CERFP tactical operations center develops the tactical situation and provides recommendations to the commander and the incident command system. The CERFP tactical operations center may provide information  or  recommendations  regarding  operational  courses  of  action,  protection  measures,  risk management reviews and revisions, and the exit strategy. Common recommendations are included in the site  safety  plan  or  the  incident  action  plan.  The  CERFP  tactical  operations  center  also  synchronizes  the employment  of  resources,  such  as  available  equipment,  attached  personnel  (based  on  the  situation), operational  timelines,  and  work-rest  cycles.  The  CERFP  tactical  operations  center  should  assist  in  the integration of follow-on response forces and mission-essential civilian personnel into the CERFP tactical operations center. I-67.  The  commander  runs  tactical  operations  from  the  CERFP  tactical  operations  center.  The  CERFP tactical operations center integrates operational functions of medical, decontamination, fatality search and recovery (when an ANG fatality search and recovery team is assigned), and search and extraction elements into a command post. Command communications are established and maintained within the CERFP teams and  with  external  agencies.  Through  the  CERFP  tactical  operations  center,  the  commander  orchestrates support of the CERFP mission by logistics, administrative, and incident awareness and assessment updates. Hot-zone  entries  and  activities  are  reported  to  the  CERFP  tactical  operations  center,  and  catastrophic incident data is analyzed and channeled through the appropriate report status. Elements send operational status reports to the CERFP tactical operations center as directed. PHASE IV (STABILIZE) I-68.  This  phase  begins  upon  CERFP  mission  termination  at  the  incident  site  and  ends  with  the  proper transition  of  CERFP  operations  to  a  local  authority  or  follow-on  force.  During  this  phase  the  CERFP commander coordinates with the incident command system and the supported JFHQ-state and JTF-state to begin the transition process and prepare for redeployment. I-69.  The  CERFP  conducts  a  relief  in  place  and  the  transition  of  authority  with  designated  agencies  or follow-on forces according to the incident command system or JTF-state instructions. Following the relief in  place  or  transition  of  authority,  the  CERFP  moves  to  the  intermediate  staging  base  and  prepares  for redeployment. The intermediate staging base for redeployment preparation is designated by the JFHQ and JTF supported state. Decisive to this operation is a secure and proper transition of the mission to the follow-on  force  or  agency.  This  phase  ends  upon  arrival  at  the  intermediate  staging  base  or  designated redeployment staging area. I-70.  The  CERFP  command  element  provides  guidance  to  subordinate  tactical  operations  centers  to develop termination procedures. The tactical operations center subsequently develops the termination plan for approval by the commander. The tactical operations center coordinates with the incident command post representatives for any additional resources needed for hazmat disposal and the area of operations transfer of responsibility. I-71.  The  unit  or  task  force  should  conduct  a  termination  briefing  with  the  incident  command  system representatives to address the final assessment, which includes a review of the assigned strategic objectives; a  final  analysis;  a  list  of  completed,  incomplete,  or  in-process  objectives;  the  medical  status  report  of casualties; identified safety issues; lessons learned; and outstanding strategic recommendations. Once the 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 I-9 Appendix I  incident command system representatives indicate concurrence with, or approval of, the briefing, the unit or task  force  should  coordinate  an  immediate  release  from  the  response  tasking  and  continue  with  the appropriate preparations for redeployment to the home station. I-72.  The  preparation  for  redeployment  is  performed  according  to  the  unit  procedures,  but  it  must  be coordinated  with  the  incident  command  system  representatives  to  ensure  a  safe  withdrawal  from  the response.  Care  must  be  taken  to  recover  equipment.  Input  from  each  element  allows  the  logistics noncommissioned  officer  and  the  tactical  operations  center  to  determine  the  costs  associated  with  the incident  and  to  initiate  appropriate  financial  liability  investigations  for  lost,  damaged,  or  destroyed property. I-73.  Key  tasks  during  this  phase  are  liaison,  C2,  coordination,  assessment,  situational  awareness,  and logistics  support  to  enable  the  hand  over  of  operations  to  those  agencies  responsible  for  community recovery. PHASE V (TRANSITION) I-74.  This phase begins upon the arrival at the intermediate staging base and ends upon the dismissal of the forces at the release points. During this phase, the CERFP conducts reverse joint reception; staging, onward movement; and integration operations, final contamination checks, equipment reloading for transport, and coordination with the parent JFHQ-state for tracking redeployment. Upon the completion of reverse joint reception; staging, onward movement; and integration and other key tasks, the CERFP returns via ground or air to its parent state and reports movements en route. Upon arrival at the assembly point, the CERFP conducts  maintenance  and  final  checks  on  personnel  and  equipment  and  then  dismisses  the  units  upon approval by the proper authority. Decisive to this phase of operation is the proper reverse joint reception; staging,  onward  movement;  and  integration  before  movement  and  the  proper  final  checks  at  the  release points. This phase ends upon the dismissal of the force. I-75.  Key tasks during this phase are the mission transition to civil authorities, personnel and equipment accountability, force medical care, unit and element movement, and after action reporting.  HRF I-76.  The following discussion is provided to establish a baseline of actions and activities for responding to a CBRN incident that uses CERFP/HRF employment. Supported state refers to the state or states that have  requested  CBRN  response  forces  to  assist  with  lifesaving  and  the  mitigation  of  human  suffering. Supporting states are the states providing CBRN response forces and includes the HRF states. HRF states are the states that have been assigned a regional HRF. PHASE 0 (SHAPE) I-77.  Phase 0 is the shape phase and ends with the alert to assemble for a CBRN incident response. During this  phase,  the  HRF  conducts  the  individual  and  collective  training  necessary  to  validate  its  mission-essential  tasks.  During  this  phase,  individuals  attend  schooling  and  leaders  conduct  coordination  and planning within the FEMA region. I-78.  Regional CBRN plans are developed, coordinated, and synchronized between federal, state, and local levels. Success criteria for this phase of operation are the completion of comprehensive response plans and the sustained validation of the HRF. This phase ends upon alert of the HRF. I-79.  Key tasks during this phase are training, equipping, exercising, validating, planning, coordinating, and securing agreements among governors. The HRF must have a joint operation planning and execution system, air movement, and time-phased force and deployment data developed during Phase 0 and updated in Phases I and II. I-80.  The HRF conducts the individual and collective training necessary to validate joint mission-essential tasks. A training assessment is completed in an external evaluation by the National Guard Bureau and U.S. Army  North.  HRF  is  validated  by  the  adjutant  general  in  personnel,  equipment,  and  training.  The development of standard operating guidance and unit procedures. The standard operating guidance and unit I-10 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Phases of Operations  procedures  provide  the  tactical  level  of  detail  for  assembly,  marshalling,  preparations,  load  out,  and movement and the actions for employment upon arrival. I-81.  The HRF regional response, national, and geospecific plans are developed and approved by the HRF commander and the regional adjutant general to facilitate the safe and rapid deployment and employment of CBRN assets to an incident site. The ongoing synchronization of the family of plans between the HRF, JFHQ,  FEMA,  National  Guard  Bureau,  U.S.  Northern  Command,  and  first  responders  is  necessary  to ensure that state, regional, and national responses are harmonized. PHASE I (ANTICIPATE) I-82.  This phase begins upon alert of the HRF and ends upon the direction by proper authority to deploy the HRF to an incident site. During this phase, HRF units receive an alert order from the JFHQ-state and the  HRF  C2  alerts  their  subordinate  elements.  Upon  alert  or  notification,  HRF  elements  report  to  their respective armories, bases, or other assembly points and prepare for deployment by land or air. During this phase, National Guard Bureau and U.S. Northern Command initiate a coordinated battle rhythm to ensure that an integrated CBRN effort, situational awareness, and situational understanding are in unison. I-83.  Upon  direct  liaison  authorization  from  the  JFHQ-state,  the  HRF  commander  and  staff  coordinate with other agencies and units (civil support teams, CERFPs, State Emergency Management Agency, JFHQ, JTF of the gaining state, appropriate incident command system) involved in the incident to gain situational awareness and situational understanding and to develop and initiate movement. The National Guard Bureau (in coordination with the affected states, supporting states, U.S. Northern Command, and other interagency stakeholders)  conduct  periodic  video  teleconferences  and  other  data  calls  to  anticipate  other  required capabilities. The HRF battle staff and CERFP advance echelon are prepared to deploy within 4 hours. The CERFP maintains the same deployment timelines as the HRF. This phase ends upon the order to deploy the HRF. I-84.  Key tasks during this phase are notifying key personnel and expanding the tactical operations center and joint operations center capabilities, gaining situational awareness, and coordinating with the incident states. I-85.  The HRF alerts and assembles key personnel in the tactical operations center. The HRF commander notifies  the  casualty  assistance  support  element,  and  the  CERFP  prepares  for  deployment  to  CBRN incidents  and  prepares  the  liaison  officers  for  deployment  to  supported  states  once  the  direct  liaison authorization is established. PHASE II (RESPOND) I-86.  This phase of the operation begins when the HRF deploys to the incident site and ends when the HRF employs CBRN operations at the incident site. The order to deploy is given by the host JFHQ-state of the HRF  headquarters  and  upon  proper  coordination  between  the  National  Guard  Bureau,  the  lead  federal agency, and state and local leaders of the affected state. The movement of the HRF from the home state to the supported state intermediate staging base and reception site are coordinated and tracked through the parent  JFHQ-state  and  reported  by  the  JFHQ-state  joint  operations  center  to  the  National  Guard Coordination  Center  for  situational  awareness.  The  National  Guard  Coordination  Center  provides situational awareness to the U.S. Northern Command. I-87.  The  HRF  occupies  an  intermediate  staging  base  and  incident  base  upon  arriving  and  before beginning  operations  at  the  incident  site  and  completes  the  necessary  preemployment  tasks.  The  HRF advance  echelon  establishes  liaison  with  the  incident  commander  and  supported  agency  and  develops  a clear understanding of the mission before deploying the main body into the incident area. Decisive to this operation is the timely, sustained movement of the HRF and the proper coordination with the JFHQ-state, National  Guard  Bureau,  U.S.  Northern  Command,  and  lead  federal  agency.  This  phase  ends  upon  HRF employment at the incident site. I-88.  Key  tasks  during  this  phase  are  notification;  alert;  assemble;  mobilization;  liaison  establishment; deployment (advance echelon and main body); joint reception; staging, onward movement; and integration; and preparation to begin operations at the intermediate staging base. 26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 I-11 Appendix I  I-89.  The HRF commander receives notification from the adjutant general to mobilize designated units. The HRF may be directed to mobilize a portion of the task force (C2, CERFP, casualty assistance support element) or the entire task force.  I-90.  The HRF commander directs elements to mobilize and prepares for deployment. HRF liaison officers deploy  according  to  the  direct  liaison  authorization  to  the  supported  state  JFHQ-state,  JTF-state,  and incident command system. I-91.  The HRF alerts, marshals, and prepares to deploy after notification. HRFs conduct mission analysis and  issue  an  operation  plan  to  subordinate  commands.  An  operation  plan  facilitates  the  safe  and  rapid movement of units from the home station to the intermediate staging base. I-92.  The CERFP/HRF advance echelon and main body should be prepared to deploy to the intermediate staging base after notification. The HRF advance echelon establishes liaison with the incident commander and supported agency and develops a clear understanding of the mission before deploying the main body into the incident area. I-93.  The casualty assistance support element should be task-organized by the HRF commander to deploy with  the  CERFP/HRF  main  bodies  according  to  the  situation.  The  casualty  assistance  support  element conducts rules for use of force briefings if they are not conducted in Phase 0.  I-94.  Upon  direct  liaison  authorization,  the  HRF  deploys  liaison  officers  to  JFHQ-state/JTF-state  and incident  command  system  for  situational  awareness  and  situational  understanding  coordination  with  the joint reception; staging, onward movement; and integration of HRF elements at the incident site. I-95.  Duties of the HRF include—   C2. The HRF C2 element maintains communication with the HRF state, JFHQ-state, and joint operations  center  during  the  entire  operation  for  situational  awareness  and  situational understanding.    Advance echelon. The HRF advance echelon establishes and maintains communication with the supported  state,  JFHQ-state,  and  JTF-state  according  to  the  deployment  order  until  the  HRF main body assumes responsibility.    Main  body.  The  HRF  main  body  establishes  and  maintains  communication  with  the  JFHQ-state/JTF-state. The HRF main body establishes and maintains communication with the incident command system once given the direct liaison authorization by the supported state. I-96.  For  CBRN  forces  to  arrive  at  their  incident  sites,  the  states,  National  Guard  Bureau,  and  U.  S. Northern  Command  must  facilitate  the  onward  movement,  rapid  reception,  and  employment  of  CBRN assets at the incident site. I-97.  While  supported  states  are  responsible  for  logistics  support  of  the  requested  forces,  states  must facilitate the deployment and sustainment of these critical lifesaving forces. The U.S. Northern Command must prioritize airlift capabilities for CBRN forces. PHASE III (OPERATE) I-98.  This phase begins at the initiation of CBRN consequence management operations and ends upon the termination  of  operations  by  the  proper  authority.  During  this  phase,  the  HRF  moves  forward  from  the intermediate  staging  base  and  initiates  operations  in  support  of  the  incident  command  system  and  other units and task forces in the area of responsibility (civil support teams, CERFPs). Upon commencement, the HRF C2 expands its coordination with civil and military elements within the area of responsibility. The HRF C2 provides regular situational awareness and situational understanding to the supported state JFHQ-state  and  tracks  the  commander’s  critical  information  requirements  to  determine  if  or  when  additional CBRN capabilities need to be deployed to the site. I-99.  The  Consequence  Management  Support  Center  initiates  logistics  packages  in  the  anticipation  of sustained operations, while the HRF J-4 coordinates with the supported JFHQ-state for local logistics. The HRF commander regularly assesses the situation and makes recommendations on how to reorganize the CERFP/HRF response as it expands. Decisive to this operation is the safe and rapid employment of CBRN forces  into  the  lifesaving  battle  rhythm  of  the  incident  command  system  and  the  establishment  of  C2 I-12 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 26 April 2013 Phases of Operations  networks and systems capabilities with which to coordinate tactical efforts, while making recommendations to the JFHQ-state on additional capability requirements. This phase ends upon the termination of the HRF mission by proper authorities. I-100. Key tasks during this phase are liaison, C2, coordination, assessment, situational awareness, casualty search  and  extraction,  patient  decontamination,  emergency  medical  services,  and  logistics  support. Resource availabilities for continuous operations are vital to the success of this phase. PHASE IV (STABILIZE) I-101. This phase begins upon the termination of the HRF mission at the incident site and ends with the proper transition of HRF operations to a local authority or follow-on force. During this phase, the HRF commander coordinates with the incident command system and the supported JFHQ-state and JTF-state to begin the transition process and prepare for redeployment. I-102. The HRF conducts a relief in place and transition of authority with designated agencies or follow-on forces in coordination with the incident command system or JTF-state instructions. Following the relief in place  and  the  transition  of  authority,  the  HRF  moves  to  the  intermediate  staging  base  and  prepares  for redeployment. The intermediate staging base for redeployment preparation is designated by the JFHQ and JTF supported state. Decisive to this operation is a secure and proper transition of the mission to the follow-on  force  or  agency  which  is  critical.  This  phase  ends  upon  arrival  at  the  intermediate  staging  bases  or designated redeployment staging area. I-103. The HRF command element provides guidance to subordinate tactical operations centers to develop termination  procedures.  The  tactical  operations  center  subsequently  develops  the  termination  plan  for approval  by  the  commander.  The  tactical  operations  center  coordinates  with  incident  command  post representatives  for  additional  resources  that  are  needed  for  hazmat  disposal  and  for  the  transfer  of responsibility within the area of operations. I-104. The task force should conduct a termination briefing with incident command system representatives to  address  the  final  assessment,  which  includes  a  review  of  the  assigned  strategic  objectives;  a  final analysis; a list of completed, incomplete, or in-process objectives; the medical status report of casualties; identified safety issues; lessons learned; and any outstanding strategic recommendations. Once the incident command system representatives approve the formation briefing, the unit or task force should coordinate an immediate  release  from  the  response  tasking  and  continue  with  the  appropriate  preparations  for redeployment to the home station. I-105. The  preparation  for  redeployment  is  performed  according  to  the  unit  procedures,  but  it  must  be coordinated  with  the  incident  command  system  representatives  to  ensure  a  safe  withdrawal  from  the incident.  Care  must  be  taken  to  recover  equipment.  Input  from  each  element  allows  the  logistics noncommissioned  officer  and  the  tactical  operations  center  to  determine  the  costs  associated  with  the incident  and  to  initiate  appropriate  financial  liability  investigations  for  lost,  damaged,  or  destroyed property. I-106. Key  tasks  during  this  phase  are  liaison,  C2,  coordination,  assessment,  situational  awareness,  and logistics  support  to  enable  the  hand  over  of  operations  to  those  agencies  responsible  for  community recovery. PHASE V (TRANSITION) I-107. This phase begins upon the arrival at the intermediate staging base and ends upon the dismissal of the forces at the release points. During this phase, the HRF conducts reverse joint reception; staging, onward movement;  and  integration,  final  contamination  checks,  the  reloading  of  equipment  for  transport,  and coordination with the parent JFHQ-state for tracking redeployment. Upon the completion of reverse joint reception; staging, onward movement; and integration and other key tasks, the HRF returns via ground or air  to  its  parent  state  and  reports  movements  en  route.  Upon  arrival  at  the  assembly  point,  the  HRF conducts  maintenance  and  final  checks  on  personnel  and  equipment  and  then  dismisses  the  units  upon approval by proper authority.  26 April 2013 ATP 3-11.47/AFTTP 3-2.79 I-13 Appendix I  I-108. Key  tasks  during  this  phase  are  mission  transition  to  civil  authorities,  personnel  and  equipment accountability, unit and element movement, and after action reporting. When directed by the supported-state governor through the adjutant general, HRFs conduct mission hand over to the home states.
