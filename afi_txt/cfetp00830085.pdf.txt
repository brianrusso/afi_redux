The goal is to provide guidance and opportunities to ensure a highly trained, qualified, and motivated team of managers and leaders to perform the security forces mission today and in the future.  The CFETP consists of two parts, which are used by supervisors to plan and manage training for employees.  Police Officers and Security Guards in the security forces squadron and Police Officers at group, major commands, and field operating agencies should use this plan to perform successfully in their current positions.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the occupational series.    Section A explains how everyone will use the plan.  Section B identifies job series progression information, duties, and responsibilities; training strategies; and job series path.  Section C indicates resource constraints.  Part II includes the following:  Section A:  identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, Technical References (TR) to support training, the formal training provided, and core tasks.  Section B:  contains the training standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements.  Section C:  identifies available support materials (if any).  Section D:  identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Section E:  identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements (if any).  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  Supervisors and employees together using guidance provided in this CFETP will ensure employees receive the right training and education at the appropriate points in their careers.  Proper use of this plan enables us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.  Abbreviations and Terms Explained  Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP).

Emphasizes and supports continuing education.  Uses.  This plan is used by major command (MAJCOM) functional managers (MFMs) and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the occupational series.    The SF Civilian Career Field Manager (HQ AFSFC/DD) HQ AFSFC Police Services and Training Branches, (HQ AFSFC SFOP/SFOT), along with the MAJCOM Civilian Police Program Managers, develop/revise the formal DAF Civilian Police and Security Guard resident 5   courses.  These courses, along with other non-resident, field, and computer based training are documented in Part II of the CFETP.   MFMs ensure their training programs complement the Air Force-level training listed in the CFETP.  Identified requirements can be satisfied by on-the-job training (OJT), resident training, contract training, or exportable courses.  MAJCOMs must submit supplemental requirements to HQ AFSFC/SFOT for inclusion in this CFETP.  Units may add training requirements to this plan by using an AF Form 797.  Each individual completes the training specified in this plan using the list of courses in Part II as a reference.  Completion of training, education, and experience criteria for career advancement is a joint responsibility between supervisors and employees.  Supervisors must work with the employee to determine appropriate education and training, and ensure employees have the opportunity to attend courses.  Employees should have the initiative to chart career goals and, with the advice of the supervisor, determine realistic milestones for achieving those goals.  Coordination and Approval.  HQ AFSFC/SFOT develops this CFETP.  The approval authority is HQ AFSFC/DD, the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM).  MAJCOM Functional and Civilian Police Program Managers will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The HQ AFSFC Civilian Police Program Manager, on behalf of the AFCFM, will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy.

Example:  At the Executive Level, GS-14-15, employee would have a master‟s degree and complete Senior Developmental Education (SDE) such as Air War College or Army War College.  Occupational Series Education, Training, and Self-Development.  The education, training, and self-development needed or desired in police officer/security guard, as well as typical positions by grade grouping, are shown in the MDP at Chart 1.      Training Decisions.  This CFETP is developed to include life-cycle (day one through retirement) training requirements for police officer and security guard occupational series.  Included in this spectrum was the strategy of when, where and how to meet these training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a fragmented approach to training.  Training should be conducted on-site whenever possible to reduce TDY costs, although training for higher-level management positions is normally conducted off-site.  Career Path.  The various grade level groupings in this occupational series are stated in broad terms and establish the standards of performance.  Specific duties and responsibilities are described in the employee‟s position description or core document.  The Office of Personnel Management Group Coverage Qualification Standard for Professional and Scientific Positions is used in making qualification determinations.  Equivalent combinations of education and experience are qualifying for all grade levels for which both education and experience are acceptable.  Experience suggests individuals who aggressively pursue suggested education and training, and are available for geographic relocation to a variety of jobs of increasing responsibility will have the best chance for selection to management positions.  Other state or host nation-specific requirements may apply.    14   DAF Civilian Career Path                        Section C – Resource Constraints  The Security Guard Course is currently limited to 10 days and the Police Officer Course is currently limited to 25 days because of budget constraints.  VA-LETC is at their maximum capacity; any significant increase in the annual trained personnel requirement will require facility and staff expansion at current operational site and/or expansion to a second training venue.  Part II  Section A – Specialty Training Standard (STS).  Implementation.  This section lists the tasks performed in the major areas of the Police Officer and Security Guard series.

The tasks identified with an “X” in column 2 indicate core tasks for each series.  As a minimum, trainees must be trained on all core tasks for that series.  Units that encounter situations where training constraints exist (for example, lack of equipment, training areas, etc), must submit a waiver request through their MAJCOM functional manager to the AFCFM (HQ AFSFC/DD) and, if approved, document the approval in unit and individual training records.  MAJCOMs determine the method to record training constraint waivers for their subordinate units.    Provides certification for OJT.  Column 3 is used to document completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Task certification must show a completion date.   Shows formal training requirements.  Column 4 is used to indicate training received at the        in-residence VA-LETC course(s).  A behavioral statement code indicates if the training received was subject knowledge training, performance training, or performance knowledge training.   Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  Document and certify completion of training.  Identify duty position requirements for every series duty position within a unit or organization.  As a minimum, complete the following areas of the JQS:  Training Start, Training Complete, Trainee Initials, and Trainer Initials.  Decertification and Recertification.  When an individual is found to be unqualified on a previously certified duty position task, the supervisor deletes the previous certification dates and initials.
