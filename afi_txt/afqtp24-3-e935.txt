The instructor will stop the test at any time safe 25K-loader operations are not being followed or as deemed necessary for safety concerns.   A4.4.   Confidence Course Overview.  A4.4.1.   Introduction.  A4.4.1.1.  The Halvorsen loader confidence course was developed to allow supervisors and instructors flexibility in determining the current proficiency level and capabilities of new and current Halvorsen operators.  The confidence course focuses on the unique turning characteristics of the Halvorsen loader, but also addresses backing and spotting as well.  The course is used for Halvorsen loader students as an indoctrination tool and as a way to provide evaluation before licensing and semiannual recertification.  A4.4.1.2.  The  Halvorsen  loader  confidence  course  will  allow  students,  novice,  and experienced operators to refocus on areas they may be deficient in.  Operators must be aware of the hazards associated with right and left hand turns, rear end swing, and be able to accurately judge or determine the loader’s exact position while operating it.  A4.4.1.3.  The  Halvorsen  loader  confidence  course  is  set  up  in  a  closed  environment. Traffic cones mark hazard areas and if knocked down, will identify to the operator and evaluator possible driving deficiencies.  In the final analysis, the course will reflect whether or not the operator has the tendency to over-steer or understeer the loader.  This will allow evaluators to have an established mechanism that could prevent potential accidents and identify problem areas.  A4.4.1.4.  It is imperative that supervisors use the Halvorsen loader confidence course as a means to provide positive feedback to their operators.  Most Halvorsen accidents have resulted  because  of  poor  or  improper  judgment  or  overconfidence  on  behalf  of  the Halvorsen operators.  A4.4.2.   Negotiating the Confidence Course.  A4.4.2.1.  The red arrows denote the first part of the course.  During this part of the course, the instructor will act as the spotter and spot the loader while the operator backs in between the first set of cones.  After operators have shown they can follow spotting directions and the Halvorsen’s cab is in line with the first cone, they will begin the clockwise portion of the  course  by  following  the  blue  arrows  on  the  map.    After  operators  negotiate  the clockwise portion of the course, they will follow the yellow transition arrows in the reverse direction and stop at the finish line.  A4.4.3.   How to Set-up the Confidence Course.  A4.4.3.1.  It  is  imperative  that  the  course  is  set  up  in  an  area  that  has  plenty  of  room; minimum area required is 362’ long by 114’ wide and free of congestion and traffic.  The area should be as flat as possible; topography has some effect on exact cone placement.  A4.4.3.2.  Course requires twenty-four, 28-inch standard traffic cones.  The 28-inch traffic cone will be the minimum height for cones used; the higher the cone the better visibility the operator will have, as well as a finer sense of the area he/she has to maneuver through.  A4.4.3.3.  The course should be set up in an area with a 362’ straight centerline.  This will enhance precise cone placement and will save time in setting up the course.  If the course is set up in a haphazard way or traffic cones are set up in general areas rather than precise locations, it will increase or decrease the difficulty in negotiating the course.  A4.4.4.   Testing.  A4.4.4.1.  Initial operators will practice their abilities on the confidence course. This will allow them to focus on the unique turning characteristics of the Halvorsen loader.  The instructor will ensure the schedule allows for sufficient time during the 10-day class to allow students maximum driving time.  Driving to a variety of aircraft, performing interface with highline docks, and driving the confidence course are great ways for the operator to receive balanced training.  The course is a good way to get critical driving experience when no aircraft are available.  A4.4.4.2.  Passing score will be mandatory for operators to initially receive Halvorsen on their  license.    All  operators  will  be  allowed  to  practice  two  runs  before  final  grading.  Instructors will allow the operator a maximum of two chances to demonstrate the ability to safely complete the course during grading.  A maximum of three cones can be hit during the test the fourth cone will result in a failure.  Operators performing their annual training requirements must meet the same standards; if a passing score is not achieved, the operator will not be allowed to drive the Halvorsen without a trainer present.  The Halvorsen QTP will be re-accomplished, followed by driving time with a trainer present until the operator can demonstrate the ability to safely maneuver the course within passing standards.   Figure A4.1.
