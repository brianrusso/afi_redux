Requests from other services should be submitted, through command channels, to HQ ACC/A3T or other appropriate MAJCOM office in accordance with applicable directives. 1.6.  Scheduling and Policies.  Per MAJCOM supplement to this instruction. 1.7.  Support  Manual.  Detailed  information  on  show  site  pre-show  coordination  requirements is  contained  in  the  MAJCOM  Single-Ship  Demonstration  Team  Support  Manual.  This  manual requires annual revision and should be made available to all aerial event coordinators hosting a single-ship  demonstration  team,  via  website,  e-mail,  normal  mail,  or  fax.  For  example,  HQ ACC/A3TA maintains a copy of the current ACC Support Manual on the Air Combat Command Aerial Events website (http://www.acc.af.mil/aerialevents/). 1.8.  Arresting  Gear  Support.  For  the  F-15E  Strike  Eagle  and  F-16  Demonstration  teams: Show  sites  without  an  arresting  gear  and  with  runways  less  than  8,000  feet  must  provide temporary arresting gear unless an airfield with suitable arresting gear on a 7,000 feet or greater runway, or a runway with length greater than 10,000 feet is within 80nm of the staging location AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 19 and  show  site.  (T-2).  For  the  F-22  Demonstration  team:  All  show  sites  (regardless  of  runway length) must have either a suitable arresting gear (BAK-12 or equivalent) on site or at a 7000 feet or greater runway within 80nm of the staging location and show site. (T-2). 1.9.  Reporting. 1.9.1.  Any  unusual  occurrence  (In-Flight  Emergencies,  Aborts/KIO,  weather  cancellations, FAA  profile  violations,  or  any  safety-of-flight-related  issue)  will  be  reported  by  the  pilot, narrator, ground safety observer, or NCOIC via phone, fax, or email ASAP to the MAJCOM Aerial Events office. (T-2). 1.9.2.  Submit  End  of  Show  Summaries  and  Critiques  to  MAJCOM  Aerial  Events  NLT  1 week after each show IAW the MAJCOM approved format.  See sample at Attachment 2. 1.10.  Recommended Changes. 1.10.1.  Refer  recommended  changes  and  questions  about  this  publication  to  the  Office  of Primary  Responsibility  (OPR)  using  the  AF  Form  847,  Recommendation  for  Change  of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command to HQ ACC/A3T. 1.10.1.1.  Forward recommendations for new or modified maneuvers not detailed in this instruction  through  the  WG/CC  to  the  MAJCOM/A3  for  concept  approval  before proceeding  with  simulator  testing  and  development  of  detailed  parameters  and  abort procedures.  Following  MAJCOM/A3  concept  approval,  new  maneuvers  will  be developed by the demo pilot and evaluated in the simulator prior to flight. (T-2).  Demo pilots must obtain WG/CC approval prior to flight testing. (T-2). Document the approval in  the  grade  book.  Once  parameters  have  been  established  and  the  maneuver  has  been flown  satisfactorily  in  the  simulator,  demo  pilots  will  fly  and  evaluate  maneuvers  in working airspace greater than 5,000’ AGL and then again at greater than 2,000’ AGL. (T-2). Once safety evaluation has been accomplished in working airspace, demo pilots will fly the maneuver over the airfield at or above 1,000’ AGL and again at 500’ AGL, prior to  flying  the  maneuver  at  maneuver  minimums.  (T-2).  Document  all  maneuver evaluations on a grade sheet and maintain them in the demo pilot’s gradebook. Once the maneuver is perfected in practice, submit a change to this AFI  IAW  paragraph 1.10.1. Demo pilots will not perform new or modified maneuvers in actual demonstrations unless approved by MAJCOM/CC. (T-2). 1.10.2.  Each  demonstration  team  may  supplement  this  instruction  as  necessary.  Team organization,  maintenance  support,  selection  criteria,  and  training  programs  for  new  pilots are  examples  of  items  that  may  be  supplemented.  Submit  supplements  or  operating instructions to HQ ACC/A3TA for coordination prior to publication. 1.11.  Demonstration Performance Reviews / Grade Sheets. 1.11.1.  Record  every  practice  and  demonstration  at  locations  with  appropriate  level  of classified storage capability, to include all home station demonstration sorties, on the pilot’s HUD  tape.    Videotape  every  practice  and  demonstration  involving  aerobatics  of  any  kind conducted below 2,000 feet AGL. Do not post video to any public web site until approved by MAJCOM/PA. Debrief each demonstration using these videotapes and HUD when available. Demonstration  pilots  will  use  the  approved  grade  sheet  to  evaluate  each  flight.  (T-2). 20 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 MAJCOM/CC or A3 may request a videotape and HUD  tape for review at any time during the  air  show  season.  Demonstration  teams  will  maintain  videotapes,  and  HUD  tapes  for  a minimum  of one  year.  (T-2). Keep performance  grade sheets  at  the unit for the duration of the  demo  pilot's  assignment.  Approved  grade  sheet  templates  will  be  provided  by ACC/A3TA. 1.11.2.  Grade  each  maneuver  using  a  scale  of  0  to  4  and  average  to  compute  an  overall demonstration  grade  of  0  to  4.  Wing  reviewers  must  comment  and  make  recommendations on any maneuver graded zero (0). (T-2). A maneuver grade of 0 should not be automatically considered  dangerous  unless  the  manner  in  which  the  maneuver  was  performed  created  a safety of flight situation. However, if safety is compromised then the overall demonstration is zero (0). Wing  reviewers will recommend  additional training for  any overall demonstration graded zero (0). (T-2).  The average grade for a typical air show should be a two (2). Ensure grade sheets reflect altitude and airspeed to the greatest accuracy possible. Use the following grading criteria to establish individual maneuver and overall demonstration grades. 1.11.2.1.  To  compute  the  maneuver  grade,  “X”  equals  the  distance  between  the  target and  minimum  altitudes.  As  an  example,  if  the  target  altitude  is  6,000  feet  and  the minimum  altitude  is  5,000  feet  then  “X”  equals  1000  feet  and  1/2X  equals  500  feet. Grade 0 would be given for all altitudes below 5,000 feet; Grade 1 for all altitudes from 5,000  to  5,499  feet;  Grade  2  for  all  altitudes  5,500  to  5,999  feet  and  above  6,501  feet; Grade  3  for  all  altitudes  from  6,001  to  6,500  feet;  and  Grade  4  if  altitude  equals  6,000 feet. (Figure 1.1) 1.11.2.2.  GRADE 0 – Altitude below minimum, or airspeed out of limits 1.11.2.3.  GRADE 1 – Altitude >1/2X below target, and airspeed within limits 1.11.2.4.  GRADE 2 – Altitude <1/2X below target or >1/2X above target, and airspeed within limits 1.11.2.5.  GRADE 3 – Altitude <1/2X above target, and airspeed +/- 25 knots of target 1.11.2.6.  GRADE 4 – Altitude on target, and airspeed +/- 10 knots of target 1.11.2.7.  Airspeed  criteria  do  not  apply  to  the  A-10  unless  airspeed  is  below  minimum parameter; the maneuver grade is zero. 1.11.2.8.  OVERALL GRADE = Computed average of the maneuver scores. 1.11.2.8.1.  0 = Dangerous performance 1.11.2.8.2.  1 = Safe performance, but trend is low 1.11.2.8.3.  2 = Average performance 1.11.2.8.4.  3 = Outstanding performance 1.11.2.8.5.  4 = Perfect performance; no deviations 1.11.3.  Refer  to  paragraph    1.4.5.9  for  wing  and  HHQ  grade  sheet  and  tape  review requirements. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 21 Figure 1.1.  Grading Ranges. 1.12.  Proficiency Requirements.  1.12.1.  Demo  Pilots:  To  maintain  currency,  each  pilot  will  fly  a  minimum  of  one demonstration  every  15-calendar  days.  (T-2).    Schedule  a  practice  session  or  actual demonstration at least once per week during air show season.  If the 15 calendar day currency is  exceeded,  the  next  demonstration  is  limited  to  no-lower-than  1,000  feet  AGL  target  and 900  feet  AGL  minimum  on  all  maneuvers,  and  the  operations  group  commander,  deputy operations group commander, or WG/CC designee must be present. (T-2).  MAJCOMs may determine additional procedures for pilots to regain currency. 1.12.2.  Ground  Safety  Observers:  Perform  as  ground  safety  observer  for  a  complete maneuver profile at least once every 120 days.  Non-current safety observers will execute the duties  of  the  safety  observer  at  an  official  or  practice  demonstration  while  under  the observation  of  a  certified  safety  observer.  (T-2).  Document  this  training  in  the  demo  team grade book. 1.12.3.  If an actual abort is not encountered, practice pilot abort procedures during practice demonstrations  at  least  once  each  60  days.  For  the  purpose  of  meeting  this  currency requirement, during a practice demonstration, the safety observer initiates the abort call. 22 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 1.13.  Termination  Procedures.  Terminate  demonstrations  involving  aerobatics  flown  below 2,000 feet AGL when: 1.13.1.  The safety observer is unable to monitor the safe performance of maneuvers. 1.13.2.  Two-way  radio  communication  is  lost  between  the  demonstration  pilot  and  safety observer. 1.13.3.  Videotaping is lost. 1.13.4.  Any time when in the judgment of the pilot or safety observer the safety of the pilot or spectators is compromised. 1.14.  Transition  During  Performance.  Each  demonstration  should  be  planned  to  fly  a complete high, low, or flat show profile. However, conditions such as a changing ceiling in the show  area  may  require  the  demonstration  pilot  to  transition  between  show  profiles  at  certain transition points. Determine frequency of transition between profiles via MAJCOM supplement to this directive. 1.15.  Altimeter Procedures.  It is essential that each demonstration pilot be able to quickly and accurately assess actual altitude above the ground during any maneuver in the demonstration. To avoid  the  mental  exercise  required  to  subtract  an  odd-numbered  field  elevation  from  the  MSL altimeter reading to get above ground altitude, use one of the two procedures described below to “zero  the  altimeters”  (QFE).  Use  these  procedures  for  all  practice  and  actual  demonstrations whether flown from takeoff at the show site or takeoff from a deployed location. 1.15.1.  Zero  Altimeter  Method.  Dial aircraft altimeter until indicator reads “0”.  Use this method if possible. 1.15.2.  Nearest  1,000  Feet  Method.    If  it  is  not  possible  to  zero  the  altimeter,  dial  the altimeter  to  the  current  altimeter  setting  for  the  field,  then  round  up  or  down  to  the  most appropriate 1,000 feet corrected field elevation (500, round down; 501, round up). 1.16.  Communication  Procedures.  The  demonstration  pilot  and  safety  observer  will  operate on  a  discrete  frequency  during  all  practice  and  official  demonstrations.  (T-2).    This  is  to minimize  the  amount  of  third-party  radio  chatter  that  can  distract  the  demo  pilot  and  step  on required  radio  calls  from  the  pilot  and  safety  observer  during  the  demonstration.  The  safety observer will be the only person in direct contact with the demo pilot. (T-2).  As such, all other parties  coordinate  through  the  safety  observer  for  any  information  needed  regarding  the  demo pilot  or  the  demonstration.  To  ensure  communications  with  the  appropriate  controlling  agency (tower or air boss), the safety observer will monitor the appropriate control frequency. (T-2).  If the  safety  observer  is  engaged  in  a  protracted  conversation  with  the  controlling  agency  that prevents  the  safety  observer  from  devoting  100%  attention  to  the  primary  duty  of  visually  and aurally monitoring the demonstration, the safety  observer will terminate the demonstration. (T-2).    Once  the  situation  has  been  resolved  and  the  safety  observer  can  once  again  give  the demonstration 100% attention, the demonstration may continue. 1.17.  Use  of  Teams  for  Static  Display.  The  demonstration  pilot  and  narrator/ground  safety observer  should  normally  arrive  in  two  aircraft  with  one  to  be  used  as  a  spare  for  the demonstration.  Do  not  use  the  spare  aircraft  for  static  display  since  it  negates  the  purpose  of  a spare aircraft for the demonstration. 1.18.  Disbursement of Demonstration Team Funds.  Per MAJCOM supplement. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 23 1.19.  Shortened/Modified  Demonstrations.  On  occasion,  certain  air  or  trade  shows  may require that a demonstration pilot fly a shortened or modified show, due to the time constraints applicable  to  the  show.  MAJCOMs  should  consider  the  level  of  importance  of  participating  in the  show,  the  anticipated  recruiting  value,  and  the  complexity  involved  in  shortening  a demonstration profile to determine the cost/benefit of attending the show. Further consideration should be given to demo pilot proficiency and experience level. A profile may be shortened by removing,  or  knocking-off  the  last  few  maneuvers.  A  profile  may  be  modified  by  removing maneuvers  throughout  the  profile,  but  maintaining  the  sequential  flow  of  the  remaining maneuvers. In no case will a demo pilot fly a shortened or modified profile when request is made upon  arrival  at  the  show  site.  (T-2).  A  minimum  of  four  weeks’  notice  is  needed  from  show POCs for a shortened or modified profile to be considered, and the show POC then notifies the team of the allotted performance time. The demo pilot then shortens or modifies the profile to fit in  the  allotted  time  by  removing  certain  maneuvers,  but  the  maneuvers  must  flow  in  the  same sequence as the full profile. (T-2). Demo pilots will submit a modified profile through command aerial  events  to  MAJCOM/A3  for  approval  NLT  three  weeks  prior  to  the  show.  (T-2). (OCONUS MAJCOM/A3s (PACAF) may delegate the approval authority for modified profiles no lower than WG/CC. Include delegation of approval authority in the MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-246, Vol. 1.) Demo pilots are required to practice modified profiles at least once within ten  working  days  prior  to  the  show.  (T-2).  OG/CC  or  higher  will  monitor  the  practice  to  note safety considerations and listen to the narration. (T-2). 24 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 Chapter 2 DEMONSTRATION TEAM PERSONNEL SELECTION AND TRAINING 2.1.  General.  MAJCOMs  will  provide  team  description  and  location  via  supplement.  A standard team  includes two aircraft, one demonstration pilot,  a minimum  of two narrators, two safety  observers,  and  necessary  support  personnel.  A  dedicated  ground  safety  observer  is required  to  deploy  with  the  team.  Ground  safety  observers  may  not  simultaneously  perform narration  duties.  Team  selection  should  consider  factors  affecting  assignment  stability  such  as vulnerability for schools or overseas assignment. 2.2.  Demonstration  Pilot  Selection.  New demonstration pilots are normally selected by Wing Commanders in August and enter training no later than September prior to the new pilot’s first air show season. Demonstration pilot duty is normally a two-year assignment. 2.3.  Narrator/Ground Safety Observer Selection. 2.3.1.  Narrators  are  selected  by  the  wing  commander.  To  reduce  the  impact  on  flying operations  by  minimizing  the  number  of  pilots  per  TDY,  consideration  should  be  given  to select non-rated officers or NCOs as the narrator. The narrator tour of duty is a minimum of one year. 2.3.2.  Ground safety observers must be rated officers current and qualified in the MDS. (T-2).  Ground  safety  observers  are  selected  by  wing  commanders  during  training  season  for upgrade  training  in  preparation  for  the  following  air  show  season.  Demo  teams  will  be limited  to  a  maximum  of  six  ground  safety  observers  to  ensure  sufficient  currency  and proficiency for each. (T-2). The normal ground safety observer tour of duty is one year. New ground  safety  observers  may  be  trained  during  mid-season  for  PCS/deployment  reasons  if necessary, but the maximum number remains six. Record all ground safety observer names in the demo team grade book. 2.4.  Support Personnel Selection.  Support personnel are selected by the wing commander. As new  enlisted  personnel  are  assigned  to  the  demonstration  teams,  it  is  appropriate  to  request assignment  deferments.  However,  since  AFPC’s  support/approval  of  the  deferments  is  directly linked  to  overseas  assignment  vulnerability,  it  is  strongly  recommended  that  prospective  local candidates  be  verified  by  the  MAJCOM  Airman  Assignments  Branch  before  they  are  firmly hired. A cursory check with AFPC can prevent the WG/CC from hiring people for the team who are extremely vulnerable for PCS. 2.5.  Training.  Accomplish  training  according  to  the  guidelines  of  this  instruction  and  as supplemented. 2.5.1.  The  Wing  commander  may  alter  the  training  sequence  and  individual  sorties,  as necessary, to ensure proficiency and progress. Additional training sorties (TS) may be added as required. 2.5.2.  Perform  maneuvers  and  maneuver  sequences  as  described  in  this  AFI.  New demonstration pilots will demonstrate proficiency in the high, low, and flat show profiles. (T-2). AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 25 2.5.3.  New  demonstration  pilots  will  receive  flight  training  from  a  currently  qualified demonstration  pilot.  (T-2).  Each  new  demonstration  pilot  will  receive  extensive  ground training from their predecessor or a currently qualified demonstration pilot. (T-2). 2.5.4.  New  demonstration  pilots  receive  training  in  aircraft  flight  control  limitations  and performance  characteristics  affecting  the  demonstration  profile.  New  demonstration  pilots receive  training  on  common  conditions  leading  to  aborts  for  each  maneuver.  F-16 demonstration  pilots  receive  training  on  the  flight  control  system,  FLCS  limiters  and  their effect on level flight, and sustaining inverted level flight at <165 KCAS. 2.5.5.  New  demonstration  pilots  and  ground  safety  observers  receive  academic  and  flight training for abort procedures. Furthermore, the established abort procedures are standardized by  MDS.    Demonstration  pilots  will  conduct  a  minimum  of  three  abort  procedures  during upgrade sorties TS-5 through TS-11. (T-2). 2.5.6.  New  demonstration  pilots  who  fly  off-station  demonstrations  will  attend  a  minimum of two air shows with the current demonstration pilot. (T-2). If possible, have the new pilot fly with the current demonstration pilot in each air show practice demonstration (N/A for A-10 & F-22). 2.5.7.  A-10  and  F-22  will  use  a  chase  aircraft  for  TS-3  and  TS-4.  (T-2).    A  chase  aircraft may  be  used  for  missions  TS-5  through  TS-11,  or  the  instructor  may  observe  from  the ground. The minimum altitude for chase aircraft is 1,500 feet AGL. 2.5.8.  For F-15E & F-16 the currently qualified demonstration pilot monitoring the training program will observe the first solo training flight from the ground, and may act as the safety observer. (T-2). 2.5.9.  Accomplish all training in VMC. Ensure each practice, except TS-3 and TS-4, is over a runway environment.  Videotape all training flights below 2,000 feet AGL. 2.5.10.  Thoroughly  train  demonstration  team  film  crews.    Training  should  emphasize equipment operation, sound techniques to capture demonstration narration, and techniques to capture the ground environment in the field of view during low altitude maneuvers. 2.5.11.  Document  training  performance  in  an  official  grade  book  and  ensure  progress  is  monitored  by  the  wing  commander.  All  training  flights  will  be  reviewed  by  the  senior leadership IAW paragraph 1.4.5.9. (T-2). 2.5.12.  Final  wing  commander  review,  pre/re-certification  of  the  demonstration  crew  and ground  safety  observer  will  be  documented  and  forwarded  by  the  wing  commander  IAW paragraph    1.4.5.3  or    1.4.5.4  (T-2).    First-year  pilots  who  fly  demonstrations  off-station must  accomplish  at  least  one  practice  flight  off  home  station  prior  to  MAJCOM/CC certification. (T-2). 2.5.13.  Stage 1 / Stage 2 Altitude Step-down Process: 2.5.13.1.  Definitions: Stage 1: All maneuvers are flown no lower than a target altitude of 500 feet with a minimum altitude of 400 feet. Stage 2: All maneuvers are flown no lower than the target and minimum altitudes described in this AFI. 2.5.13.2.  Upgrading pilots who fly demonstrations off-station are required to practice at a minimum of three separate off-station sites at Stage 1 (higher) altitudes prior to the first 26 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 official  public  demonstration.  (T-2).  The  intent  of  this  requirement  is  for  all  upgrading pilots to gain experience at a minimum of three separate sites in a training environment before  stepping  down  to  Stage  2  (lower)  altitudes  off-station  in  an  actual  air  show environment. This requirement only affects off-station practices. Ensure all home station practices  adhere  to  the  normal  altitude  step-down  procedures  set  forth  in  the  training syllabus.  At  overseas  locations  where  this  requirement  is  impractical,  all  practice demonstrations  may  be  conducted  at  home  station.  However,  every  attempt  should  be made to satisfy the off-site training requirement before reverting to home field practices only to satisfy syllabus requirements. 2.5.13.2.1.  These off-station practices require former demonstration pilot observation and/or supervisor observation (no less than OG/CD or WG/CC designee). 2.5.13.2.2.  All  ground  video  or  HUD  recordings  and  grade  sheets  for  off-station practices require former demonstration pilot and OG/CC or WG/CC designee review. 2.5.13.2.3.  NAF / MAJCOM/CC certifications may be used for partial fulfillment of this requirement. 2.5.13.3.  In order to conduct off station demonstrations at stage 2 minimums, upgrading demo pilot must first accomplish and document IAW paragraph  2.5.11 the 3 off-station practices at stage 1 minimums, and have home station certification at stage 2 minimums. (T-2). Document this certification in the upgrading pilot’s grade book. 2.5.14.  Ground Safety Observer Training 2.5.14.1.  During any capability demonstration the ground safety observer is responsible to  advise  the  demonstration  pilot  by  radio  of  any  observed  or  developing  unsafe condition. This requires intimate knowledge of required maneuver radio calls, maneuver parameters,  and  the  timing  of  maneuvers  so  that  safety  observer  radio  calls  provide timely  correction  to  an  observed  or  developing  deviation  from  procedure  or  direction prescribed  in  this  publication.  Safety  observers  will  complete  a  closed-book  parameters test  for  those  maneuvers  requiring  parameter  radio  calls,  corrected  to  100  percent  by  a current demo pilot, prior to performing duties solo. (T-2). Document this training in the demo team grade book. 2.5.14.2.  To  increase  "air  show  situational  awareness"  and  improve  the  mutual  support with  the  demo  pilot,  ground  safety  observers  require  a  working  knowledge  of  the following  subjects:  air  show  airspace;  the  aerobatic  box;  show  lines;  crowd  lines; applicable  FARs  that  require  waiver;  interaction  with  the  air  boss;  and  air  show communication plans. These subjects should be reviewed by upgrading safety observers, and briefed by current demo pilots, using the Safety Observer academics provided by the MAJCOM.  Document  this  training  in  the  demo  team  grade  book  prior  to  performing duties  solo.  In  addition,  it  is  recommended  that  at  least  one  ground  safety  observer  per base  attend  the  Air  Shows  101  course  at  ICAS  each  year.  Ground  safety  observers  are also  familiar  with  all  applicable  procedures  and  parameters  relevant  to  MDS  in  this publication. 2.5.14.3.  Upgrading safety observers must complete a two-sortie checkout. (T-2). For the first sortie, the upgrading safety observer will observe a certified ground safety observer during an official or practice high show demonstration. (T-2). For the second sortie, the AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 27 upgrading  ground  safety  observer  will  execute  the  duties  of  the  safety  observer  at  an official  or  practice  high  show  demonstration  while  under  the  observation  of  a  certified safety observer. (T-2). Document this training in the demo team grade book. 2.6.  Training Syllabus. 2.6.1.  GT-1 (Ground Training): 2.6.1.1.  Standard Procedures 2.6.1.2.  Fuel Requirements 2.6.1.3.

Use  maneuvers  described  in  this  chapter  for  training  and  for  A-10  aerial demonstrations.  The  demonstration  sequence  is  designed  so  each  maneuver  is  normally performed in the same direction with respect to the crowd line. As a result, the show is always oriented  the  same  way  from  the  spectators'  point  of  view.  The  only  exception  to  this  is  when wind direction and velocity make it advantageous to change the direction of the gear down pass. In this case, the remaining maneuvers may be flown in the opposite direction, or repositions may be  used  to  fly  the  remaining  maneuvers  in  the  appropriate  direction.  Abnormal  Procedures  are written for each maneuver. If the entry conditions are not met for any maneuver, a wings-level pass  is  flown  and  the  pilot  transitions  to  the  next  maneuver.  Demonstration  pilots  transmit parameters  prior  to  initiating  the  descending  portion  of  vertical  pull-throughs  and  Vertical Reposition maneuvers. These calls are made when the pilot reaches apex of the maneuver. The ground  safety  observer  monitors  the  demonstration  pilot  altitude  and  airspeed  radio  calls  and directs  an  abort  when  parameter  limits  are  exceeded.  Following  all  maneuvers  and  before clearing the show line to reposition for the next maneuver, the pilot ensures any descent has been stopped and the aircraft is in a climbing or level attitude with the flight path marker at or above the horizon. 3.2.  Aircraft  Configuration  and  Fuel  Requirements.  Ensure  aircraft  configuration  for  all demonstrations is clean (no wing pylons or missiles except wingtip smoke winders) and internal fuel.  Each  demonstration  uses  approximately  1,000  pounds  of  fuel.  Optimum  performance  is obtained  when  fuel  load  is  3,500  pounds;  however,  the  demonstration  can  be  safely accomplished with a higher fuel load as long as the wing tanks are empty. The minimum fuel to start the show is 2,500 pounds. 3.3.  Airspeed  and  G  Limits.  The  A-10  demonstration  is  flown  at  max  power  except  when slowing  to  configure  for  the  gear  down  pass  or  slowing  to  configure  for  the  minimum  run landing. The maximum Target G for this demonstration profile is 6.0 Gs. This does not preclude a momentary increase in G for safety considerations. 3.4.  Show  Line  Restrictions.  The  majority  of  the  A-10  demonstration  is  flown  on  the  1,500-foot show line. Maneuvers not conforming to FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 6, require approval via the FAA AFS-800 Maneuver Package approval process. 3.5.  Airspace and Runway Requirements.  Required airspace for the A-10 is 7,000 feet AGL vertically  and  normally  a  five-mile  radius  from  show  center  horizontally.  The  minimum dimensions of the aerobatic box are 3,000 feet wide, 4,000 feet long, and 7,000 feet AGL (high show).  If the FAA has  waived  a show line to  closer than 1,500  feet, the aerobatic box may  be less  than  3,000  feet  wide,  provided  there  is  at  least  1,200  feet  from  either  the  primary  or secondary  show  line.  Minimum  runway  length  is  5,000  feet  x  75  feet.  Ensure  the  runway, taxiway, and parking area are stressed for a 35,000-pound aircraft with single wheel type landing gear. 30 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 3.6.  Weather Requirements.  Weather PARAMETER LIMITS for the high show profile are a ceiling  of  at  least  5,000  feet,  3  miles  ground  and  5  miles  in-flight  visibility  with  a  discernible horizon.  The  low  show  profile  ceiling  is  at  least  3,500  feet.  The  flat  show  profile  ceiling  is  at least 1,500 feet. The ceiling requirements for each maneuver are based on waived airspace (clear of  clouds)  and  require  adjustment  if  using  VFR  rules.  Plan  maneuvers  to  maintain  VMC throughout the show sequence. 3.7.  Demonstration Profiles. 3.7.1.  High Show 3.7.1.1.  Takeoff 3.7.1.2.  Flat Pass 3.7.1.3.  Vertical 540 3.7.1.4.

Maneuver  Description:  The  Repositioning  Turn  uses  both  horizontal  and  vertical turning room to change direction at each end of the show line. The vertical plane is used to maintain  necessary  proximity  to  the  demonstration  area.  Each  turn  may  differ  slightly  in order  to  meet  entry  TARGET  PARAMETERS for  the  next  maneuver  and  attain  the  proper show  line  alignment.  To  begin  the  maneuver,  turn  15  to  45  degrees  away  from  the  crowd (depending on environmental conditions), rollout, and pull to 45 degrees nose high, and then unload.  At  1,000  feet  minimum,  execute  a  270-degree  aileron  roll  opposite  the  show  line. Visually  acquire  the  show  line  and  make  a  descending  turn  to  meet  the  entry  TARGET PARAMETERS  for  the  next  maneuver.  Repositioning  turns  may  not  include  added  aileron rolls or other accenting maneuvers. 3.8.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  at  any  time  the  minimum  altitude,  airspeed,  or  climb angles, cannot be achieved or maintained, roll the aircraft to the nearest horizon and recover to wings- level flight. 3.9.

Maneuver Description:  Initiate a 75 to 90-degree bank turn away from the crowd to 45 degrees off the show line. (The maneuver may be flown behind the show line dependent upon  the  location  of  the  local  populace.)  Once  at  the  45-degree  turn  point,  initiate  a  5.0  to 6.0-G  pull  to  45  degrees  of  climb  (55  degrees  maximum)  and  climb  out  120  to  150  knots (120 knots minimum). At 3,500 feet AGL, initiate a 45-degree dive (55 degrees maximum) back  to  the  appropriate  show  line  for  the  next  maneuver.  Exit  from  the  High  Speed Reposition  Maneuver  by  pulling  at  1,200  feet  using  5.0  to  6.0  Gs  to  level  off  at  the appropriate entry altitude for the next maneuver. 3.9.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  at  any  time  the  minimum  altitude,  airspeed,  or  climb angles cannot be achieved or maintained, roll the aircraft to the nearest horizon and recover to wings-level flight. 3.10.  Flat  Wifferdill  Reposition  Maneuver.  The  Flat  Wifferdill  Maneuver  turn  is  a combination  horizontal  and  shallow  vertical  turn  used  to  change  direction  at  each  end  of  the show  line.  The  Flat  Wifferdill  Maneuver  turn  uses  less  altitude  than  a  normal  Repositioning Maneuver. It requires a larger cut and tends to be looser and flatter than a normal Repositioning Maneuver.  The  target  G  for  this  maneuver  is  3  to  5  Gs.  Each  turn  may  differ  slightly  so  that airspeed/altitude  parameters  for  the  next  maneuver  are  established  in  the  Flat  Wifferdill.  The entry "cut" turn for the Flat Wifferdill is made to ensure no show line or crowd line penetration. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 35 Figure 3.3.  A-10 Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver.

Maneuver  Description:  Accomplish  a  normal  takeoff  with  7-degree  flaps.  The rotation airspeed is 110 knots and should be accomplished using a smooth, continuous pull to obtain the normal takeoff attitude. Raise the gear with a positive rate of climb and retract the flaps once the gear is up and the gear horn is out. After gear and flap retraction, level off at 30 feet and accelerate to a minimum of 175 knots. At show center or the end of the runway, with a minimum of 175 knots, pull up 30 to 45 degrees nose high using 3.0 to 4.0 Gs or the steady  stall  warning  tone.  Turn  15  to  45  degrees  away  from  the  crowd  and  continue  climb out. 3.11.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  Use caution when taking off from short runways, runways at  high  density  altitudes,  or  wet  runways.  TOLD  data  is  critical  and  requires  careful computation  at  each  show  site.  Do  not  fly  if  refusal  speed  is  less  than  continuation  speed. During  the  climb  out,  if  the aircraft stalls or the  airspeed falls below 110 knots (whichever occurs first), unload and accelerate to break the stall and/or increase airspeed to a minimum of 110 knots. Climb out can then be continued. 3.12.  Flat Pass. Figure 3.5.  A-10 Flat Pass.  38 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 Table 3.4.  A-10 Flat Pass Parameters.

Maneuver  Description:  The Flat Pass is a maneuver used alone or in combination with  a  Wifferdill/Reposition  for  the  purposes  of  displaying  the  aircraft  or  orienting  the subsequent  demonstration  maneuver  in  the  approved  direction  relative  to  the  crowd  line.  It may be flown in either direction at any time during the demonstration sequence if required. It should be flown wings-level down the 500-foot show line at 300 feet AGL. 3.12.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  any  problems  are  encountered,  the  demo  pilot  should begin an immediate climbing turn away from the crowd. 3.13.

Maneuver  Description:  After completion of the Flat Pass  and on the 1,500’ show line, pull up to 90 degrees nose-high using 5.0 to 6.0 Gs, unload, and execute a 540-degree roll.  Once the roll is complete, pull the aircraft gently over onto its back and roll upright at no less than 110 knots.  Drive straight ahead and attain target entry parameters for the next maneuver. 3.13.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  Vary the angle  of climb  for wind, weather, and  aerobatic-box  considerations.    If  at  any  time  during  the  maneuver  it  appears  the  maneuver  is  not attaining the prescribed  altitude or airspeed minimums  over the top,  abort  the maneuver by performing a nose-high recovery IAW tech order procedure. 3.14.

Maneuver  Description:    (High  Show  only)  On  the  1,500’  show  line,  after  reaching the  planned  entry  parameters  of  5,500’  AGL,  perform  an  unloaded  roll  to  inverted  and perform  an  aggressive  90-degree  pull  to  vertical.    At  90  degrees  nose-low  execute  a maximum  rate  unloaded  360-degree  roll  to  be  complete  by  3,000’  AGL.    Continue  an aggressive pull to no greater than 45 degrees nose-low.  Once recovery above the minimum altitude  for  the  follow-on  maneuver  is  assured,  vary  the  G-loading  and  dive  angle  as necessary  to  meet  the  entry  parameters  for  the  next  maneuver.  As  a  technique,  passing approximately 1,200’ AGL begin a 5 to 6-G pull to level off at 500’ AGL. 3.14.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  If the entry parameters are not met, the pilot transitions to a wings-level  flat  pass  or  performs  a  slice-back  as  appropriate.    If  5,500’  is  not  met,  do  not attempt  the  360-degree  roll  on  the  down  line  and  perform  a  traditional  Split-S.    Do  not attempt to pull down from the inverted apex below 4,500’ AGL or with more than 250 KIAS. If  at  any  time,  before  reaching  the  45  degrees  nose-low  position,  the  aircraft  exceeds  375 knots,  reduce  the  throttles  and  open  the  speed  brakes  to  slow  the  aircraft  to  approximately 350  knots.    If  any  other  altitude,  airspeed,  or  dive  angle  restrictions  cannot  be  met, immediately execute a nose-low recovery by reducing the throttles to idle, opening the speed brakes, and rolling the aircraft upright to the nearest horizon. 3.15.

Maneuver  Description:  Enter  the  double  aileron  roll  from  wings-level  flight  at 500’ AGL on the 1,500’ show line.  At 3,000 feet prior to show center, initiate a smooth 5 to 9-degree  climb.    As  show  center  approaches  the  mid-point  of  the  corner  panel,  unload  the aircraft to 0 G and execute two 360-degree aileron rolls in either direction. 44 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 3.15.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  Abort the maneuver if at any time the nose falls more than 8 degrees below the horizon or the nose drops below the horizon prior to the beginning of the second roll.  Aborting the maneuver is accomplished by rolling towards the nearest horizon to  wings-level  and  climbing  to  ensure  recovery  at  or  above  minimum  altitude  is  achieved.  Excessive  nose  drop  is  most  likely  to  occur  during  the  second  half  of  the  roll  due  to insufficient  negative  stick  pressure,  and  a  decrease  in  airspeed  resulting  in  less  control surface effectiveness. 3.16.

Maneuver  Description:  Position the aircraft on the 1,500’ show line at 500’ AGL and  325  knots  using  a  reposition  maneuver.    Approximately  2,000’  prior  to  show  center, initiate an 8 to10-degree nose-high climb and begin an 8-second coordinated roll to the left.  Top  rudder  should  be  applied  approaching  90  degrees,  and  then  slowly  fed  out  as  forward stick pressure is applied to reach -1 G inverted flight at the 180-degree point.  Left rudder is slowly fed in through the 270-degree point and slowly fed out to reach upright 1 G flight at 500’ AGL.  Dive angle during the exit should not exceed 8 degrees. 3.16.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  Abort the maneuver if at any time the nose falls more than 8 degrees below the horizon or the nose drops below the horizon prior to the inverted point.  Aborting the maneuver is accomplished by rolling towards the nearest horizon to wings-level and climbing to ensure recovery at or above minimum altitude is achieved.  Excessive nose drop  is  most  likely  to  occur  during  the  second  half  of  the  roll  due  to  insufficient  negative stick pressure, and a decrease in airspeed resulting in less control surface effectiveness. 3.17.

Maneuver  Description:  On  the  1,500’  show  line,  with  wings  level  and  500  feet AGL begin a smooth 6.0-G pull not to exceed the steady stall warning tone.  Minimum apex altitude is 3,000 feet AGL with a minimum of 120 knots.  Continue the pull until the aircraft is 45 degrees nose-low inverted (55 degrees maximum).  Due to winds, it may be necessary to  use  more  or  less  than  45  degrees  nose-low  in  order  to  maintain  show  center  orientation.  The typical range is between 30 to 55 degrees nose-low.  Do not exceed 55 degrees nose-low.  At or above 3,000’ AGL execute a 2-point hesitation roll on the 45-degree down line.  Roll wings-level  from  the  90-degree  hesitation  point  at  or  above  2,000’  AGL.    The  90-degree hesitation  point  requires  top  rudder  to  maintain  the  45-degree  down  line  and  zero  G  to maintain the show line (G may be varied to adjust to the show line). As a technique, passing approximately 1,200 feet AGL, begin a 5 to 6.0-G pull to level off at 500 feet AGL.  Normal apex  altitude  is  3,500  to  5,000  feet  AGL  depending  upon  environmental  conditions.  The second half is completed in the opposite direction. 3.17.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If at any time during the maneuver it appears you may not attain the prescribed altitude or airspeed over the  top, abort the maneuver by performing an unloaded  roll  to  a  wings-level  position.  Furthermore,  if  more  than  45  degrees  nose-low inverted is necessary due to winds, add 100 feet for every degree steep to roll-out and pull-out altitudes. If more than 55 degrees nose-low, roll out immediately. If unable to reach 45 degrees nose-low at or above 3,000’ AGL on either half of the Cuban 8, execute a maximum rate 180-degree roll to wings-level at 2,500’ AGL and execute recovery as described above. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 47 3.18.  ½ Reverse Cuban 8.

Maneuver  Description:  (High  Show  Only)  On  the  1,500’  show  line,  with  wings level and 500 feet AGL or greater begin a smooth wings-level 6.0-G pull (not to exceed the steady stall warning tone) to a 40 to 70-degree nose-high attitude.  At a minimum of 3,000 feet  AGL,  perform  an  unloaded  180-degree  aileron  roll  to  achieve  an  inverted  climbing attitude.  Initiate  a  smooth  pull  to  the  horizon  to  achieve  a  wings-level  inverted  position  at 5,000 feet AGL. Continue the pull through the vertical, using 2.0-4.0 Gs, to 135 degrees of turn  (45  degrees  nose-low).    Once  recovery  above  the  minimum  altitude  for  the  follow  on maneuver  is  assured,  vary  the  G-loading  and  dive  angle  as  necessary  to  meet  the  entry parameters for the next maneuver.  As a technique, passing approximately 1,200’ AGL begin a 5 to 6-G pull to level off at 500’ AGL.  The ½ Reverse Cuban 8 may be flown as a vertical reposition maneuver to change direction at either end of the show line. 3.18.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  If the entry parameters are not met, the pilot transitions to a wings-level  flat  pass  or  performs  a  slice-back  as  appropriate.  Do  not  attempt  to  pull  down from  the  inverted  apex  below  4,500’  AGL  or  with  more  than  250  KIAS.  If  at  any  time, before reaching the 45 degrees nose-low position, the aircraft exceeds 375 knots, reduce the throttles  and  open  the  speed  brakes  to  slow  the  aircraft  to  approximately  350  knots.  If  any other altitude, airspeed, or dive angle restrictions cannot be met, immediately execute a nose-low  recovery  by  reducing  the  throttles  to  idle,  opening  the  speed  brakes,  and  rolling  the aircraft upright to the nearest horizon. 3.19.

Maneuver  Description:  Position the aircraft on the 1,500’ show line at 500’ AGL and 325 knots. At show center, turn away from the crowd using approximately 85 degrees of bank.  Begin  the  turn  with  a  smooth  G-onset-rate  to  maintain  6.0  Gs  or  the  steady  stall warning horn whichever occurs first. G-loading and airspeed bleed-off rate vary with density altitude.  Maintain  a  minimum  of  240  knots.  The  first  180  degrees  of  turn  should  be accomplished  with  a  1  ¾-degree  nose-up  attitude  and  the  last  180  should  be  accomplished with a 1 ¾-degree nose-down attitude to make the turn appear level to the crowd. Vary the 50 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 bank angle and pitch to arrive at level flight at the completion of 360 degrees of turn and to ensure the maneuver is finished above the entry altitude. Ensure surface winds are taken into consideration  in  order  to  center  this  maneuver  and  to  avoid  overshooting  the  show  line. Continue  the  turn  past  360  degrees  as  required  (usually  30  to  45  additional  degrees  of  turn depending on winds) in order to transition to the reposition maneuver used to set up for the Gear Down pass. 3.19.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  the  minimum  entry  parameters  are  not  met,  the  pilot transitions  to  a  wings-level  flat  pass.  If  during  any  portion  of  the  maneuver  it  becomes apparent the aircraft is descending below 400 feet AGL or airspeed decays below 240 knots, abort the maneuver by rolling wings-level and climbing to 500 feet AGL. If necessary, adjust G as required (no lower than 240 knots) to avoid overshooting the show line. 3.20.  Gear Down Pass. Figure 3.13.  A-10 Gear Down Pass. Table 3.12.

Maneuver  Description:  After  completion  of  the  Level  360,  initiate  a  turn  toward the 500-foot show line and begin slowing the aircraft below 200 knots with full speed brakes. Upon reaching the base position for the 500-foot show line and below 200 knots, configure the aircraft with gear, full flaps, and 40% speed brakes and begin a descent down to 300 feet AGL. Continue slowing the aircraft to 120 knots (110 knots minimum) while flying down the 500-foot show line. When passing the last of the  crowd, select  max power, close the speed brakes, raise the gear, and bring the flaps to seven degrees while maintaining between level flight  and  a  slight  climb.  Passing  150  knots  raise  the  flaps  to  zero  degrees.  While  level  to slightly climbing, turn away from the show line to set up for the Pop-Up Strafe Pass using 30 degrees of bank (45 degrees maximum). 3.20.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If the minimum altitude or airspeed cannot be maintained, or the aircraft stalls, abort the maneuver by selecting max power, closing the speed brakes, and setting the flaps to MVR.

Maneuver  Description:  After  passing  the  show  line  corner  marker,  turn  30-60 degrees  away  from  the  aerobatic  container  in  order  to  reposition  to  a  pull-up  point  from behind the show line.  As a technique, with show center coordinates as the active steer point, drive outbound,  45 degrees off the show line (wind  dependent). At 2nm  from  show  center, use a flat wifferdill maneuver to head back toward the corner marker with the #2 needle 20 degrees off heading at 2nm inbound.  Maintain that initial heading and use a 6-G pull-up to 45 degrees nose-high upon reaching 1.3nm.  The show center target area should be visually acquired during the wifferdill reposition.  If unable, the above technique should place the aim point just behind  the canopy bow and just above  the canopy  rail during the 45-degree pop.  Align  the  aircraft  to  approach  the  preplanned  strafe  target/point  from  an  appropriate  angle. This angle normally ranges from 10 – 30 degrees off the 500-foot show line depending on the location of the crowd line and winds. Do not allow a  vector towards the crowd! Ensure the aircraft  vector,  if  extended  to  infinity,  does  not  penetrate  the  crowd  line.  The  dive  angle  is normally  10  –  30  (5  –  15  Flat)  degrees  nose-low  depending  on  winds.  The  optimum  dive angle  is  25  (10  Flat)  degrees.  Do  not  exceed  30  (15  Flat)  degrees.  Recovery  should  be initiated at  650 feet  AGL using a max performance pull in  order to  bottom  out  at  or above 200 feet AGL. Be very careful not to over-G the aircraft during this pull. A minimum of 250 knots is required to make this corner. After recovering to level flight, accomplish a reposition maneuver to set up for the next strafe pass. Use the 500-foot show line at show center as a reference  point  for  setting  up  each  strafe  pass.  Do  not  cross  the  500-foot  show  line. Depending on winds, this may require aiming 100 – 300 feet outside the 500-foot line away from the crowd. 3.21.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If at any time the dive angle exceeds 30 (15 Flat) degrees, either  abort  the  pass  and  fly  through  straight  and  level  or  shift  the  aim  point  longer  and parallel to the show line until the dive angle is 30 (15 Flat) degrees or less. Check airspeed at 1,000  feet  AGL.  If  it  is  not  at  least  230  knots,  abort  the  pass  and  fly  through  straight  and level. 3.22.

Depending  on  winds,  this may require aiming 100 – 300 feet outside the 500-foot line away from the crowd. Following the last strafe pass, transition to the Jink-Out maneuver. 3.22.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If at any time the dive angle exceeds 30 (15 Flat) degrees, either  abort  the  pass  and  fly  through  straight  and  level  or  shift  the  aim  point  longer  and parallel to the show line until the dive angle is 30 (15 Flat) degrees or less.

Maneuver  Description:  Upon  completion  of  the  last  strafe  pass  and  level  at  the 200-foot target altitude, a 75 to 90-degree bank 5.0 to 6.0-G turn is initiated away from the crowd to complete a 100 to 135-degree turn to be at or beyond the 1,500-foot show line. At the completion of this 100 to 135-degree turn, pull 3.0 to 5.0 Gs up to 40 degrees (55 degrees maximum).  Once  pitch  degree  is  achieved,  maintain  climb  to  2,000  feet  AGL,  then  roll inverted and pull to 30 degrees nose-low (40 degrees maximum). Hold till 1,200 feet AGL, then roll to the nearest horizon and level-off at 500 feet AGL. The goal of this maneuver is to show the Jink-Out in front of show center and be at the 1,500-foot line. In order for this to occur, the 100 to 135 degrees of turn is accomplished at a target of 4.0 Gs. 3.23.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  at  any  time  during  the  maneuver  any  altitude  or climb/dive angle cannot be maintained, abort by rolling wings-level and climbing away from the crowd line. 3.24.

Maneuver  Description:  Enter  the  Four-Point  roll  on  the  1,500’  show  line  at  500 feet AGL and 325 knots. 2,000 feet prior to show center, pull the nose 3 to 5 degrees nose-high, establish a climb, and unload. A cadence four-point roll to the left is then performed by pausing momentarily  at  the 90-degree, 180-degree, 270-degree,  and 360-degree points. The pace of the cadence should ensure the aircraft is at the 180-degree point over show center. In order  to  facilitate  sharp  transitions  between  each  90  degrees  of  roll,  momentarily  fan  the speed brakes and unload the aircraft to 0 Gs at the initiation of each roll. Be sure to close the speed brakes upon completion of the roll to avoid any unnecessary loss of airspeed. The 90-degree  and  270-degree  points  require  top  rudder  to  maintain  level  flight  and  zero  G  to maintain the show line. The 180-degree point requires 1 negative G in order to maintain level flight. This is accomplished using the horizon, not the G-meter. 3.24.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  at  any  time  during  the  Four-Point  Roll,  the  nose  falls more than five degrees below the horizon, abort by rolling towards the nearest horizon and a wings-level position, then continue down the show line. This would most likely occur during the  3rd  point  (270  degrees)  due  to  a  decrease  in  airspeed,  which  results  in  less  rudder effectiveness. 3.25.  Dedication Pass.  The intent of this maneuver is to pay tribute to our war fighters. It is to be flown before the Tactical Pitch-Up to Land during the High, Low, and Flat Show profiles. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 59 Figure 3.18.  A-10 Dedication Pass. Table 3.17.

Maneuver  Description:  The  maneuver  is  flown  beyond  the  500-foot  line.  After performing the Four-Point Roll or Strafe Passes, execute a reposition maneuver on the crowd side  to  arrive  behind  and  offset  the  crowd.  Fly  the  approach  from  behind  the  line, approximately  2  miles  from  show  center,  with  an  approximate  30-degree  dive  angle  and  a 45-degree  cut  (bank  angle  75  to  90  degrees)  to  the  show  line,  remaining  beyond  500  feet from the crowd at all times. Upon reaching a point 500 feet from the corner of the crowd and 60 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 300 feet AGL, roll the aircraft into a level arcing pass using a bank of 75 to 90 degrees. Use top  rudder  if  necessary  to  maintain  altitude.  Optimum  profile  of  the  aircraft  is  achieved  at approximately  80  degrees  of  bank.  Use  caution  not  to  over  bank  the  aircraft  and  allow  the aircraft to lose altitude while banking. In order to maintain 500 feet from the crowd at each corner,  ensure  the  flight  path  at  show  center  extends  beyond  500  feet.  Continue  the  arc beyond  the  opposite  crowd  corner,  roll  out  of  bank,  and  continue  a  maximum  45-degree climb to set up for the Tactical Pitch-Up to Landing. 3.25.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  Abort the maneuver if at any time the aircraft comes closer than 500’ to the crowd line or its lateral limits, an excessive dive angle or sink rate develops, entry  parameters  are  not  met,  or  the  aircraft  descends  below  200  feet  AGL.  Abort  the maneuver by rolling the aircraft wings-level and flying away from the crowd. 3.26.  Tactical Pitch-Up to Land. Figure 3.19.  A-10 Tactical Pitch-up to Land. Table 3.18.

Maneuver Description:  Reposition the aircraft to level off at 300 feet AGL, on the 500-foot show line at 325 knots (200 knots minimum). Roll into 75 to 90 degrees of bank to turn 90 degrees away from the crowd line. Once pointed away from the crowd, pull 5.0 to 6.0 Gs  to  40  degrees  nose-high  to  achieve  1,000  feet  AGL  minimum.  At  1,000  feet  AGL minimum  execute  a  non-acrobatic  270-degree  roll  and  pull  toward  the  perch  point  of  the landing  runway.  Begin  slowing  the  aircraft  and  configure  for  landing  with  gear,  full  flaps, and 40% speed brakes. Fly a normal base to final (no slower than 135 knots final turn). On final,  continue  slowing  to  120  knots  (110  minimum)  to  touchdown.  After  touchdown, perform  a  minimum  run  landing  by  lowering  the  nose,  opening  the  speed  brakes  full,  and initiating  full  anti-skid  braking  bringing  the  aircraft  to  a  complete  stop.  Plan  to  do  the minimum  run  landing  to  stop  at  show  center.  This  is  accomplished  by  planning  your touchdown point 2,000 feet prior to show center. Do not land 2,000 feet prior to show center if, at  the point of touchdown, there is  less than 5,000 feet  of useable runway remaining.  In this case, plan your touchdown normally in the first 500 feet of runway.                Option: If a Heritage Flight is to be performed immediately following completion of the demonstration, this maneuver may be deleted and a Flat  Pass  may be substituted.  If not  deleted, conduct  a wings-level  low  approach  or  wings-level  pass  and  proceed  to  rejoin  with  Heritage  Flight aircraft using pre-briefed procedures. 3.26.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  airspeeds,  altitudes,  or  stall  warning  indications  are experienced with the stick shaker, execute a Go-Around to recover the aircraft. Once the Go-Around is completed, the pilot then turns out to downwind (away from the crowd)  and sets up for a normal straight-in to full stop. 3.27.  Staged  Show  Sites.  When  demonstration  aircraft  takeoff  from  other  than  the  air  show site,  ensure  fuel  planning  includes  the  fuel  required  flying  to  and  from  the  show  site,  and  any holding  time  required.  The  pilot  may  enter  the  show  from  behind  the  crowd  at  a  minimum  of 1,000 ft AGL as depicted in Figure 3.18, or via a Flat Pass maneuver down the show line, and 62 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 complete  the  show  as  described  in  this  chapter.  Upon  completion  of  the  Dedication  Pass  and clearing the crowd, turn out behind the crowd and return to the staging airport. Pilots should plan to fly a full demonstration, but may cut the profile short as required to maintain suitable enroute return fuel. Figure 3.20.  A-10 Staged Show Sites.  AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 63 Chapter 4 F-15E DEMONSTRATION MANEUVERS Section 4A—-General Information 4.1.  General.  Use  maneuvers  described  in  this  chapter  for  training  and  for  F-15E  aerial demonstrations. The demonstration sequence is designed so each maneuver is normally flown in the same direction with respect to the crowd line with the following exceptions:  The Maximum Performance  Takeoff  Inverted,  Flat  Pass,  the  first  Split-S,  and  the  aileron  roll  preceding  the tactical  pitch  to  landing.    As  a  result,  the  show  is  always  oriented  the  same  way  from  the spectators'  point  of  view.    Abnormal  procedures  are  written  for  each  maneuver.  If  the  entry conditions are not met for any maneuver, a wings-level pass is flown and the pilot transitions to the  next  maneuver.  Demonstration  pilots  transmit  parameters  prior  to  initiating  the  descending portion of vertical pull-throughs for the Split-S and Vertical Reposition Maneuvers.  These calls are  made  when  the  pilot  reaches  apex  of  the  maneuver.  Ground  safety  observer  and  the  WSO monitor demonstration pilot altitude and airspeed radio calls and direct an abort when parameter limits are exceeded.  Following all maneuvers and before clearing the show line to reposition for the  next  maneuver,  the  pilot  ensures  any  descent  has  been  stopped  and  the  aircraft  is  in  a climbing or level attitude with the flight path marker at or above the horizon. 4.2.  Aircraft  Configuration  and  Fuel  Requirements.  Ensure  aircraft  configuration  for  all demonstrations is clean with CFTs, no wing pylons on stations 2 and 8, no LANTIRN pods, no external  fuel  tanks,  and  no  travel  pods.  Fuel  considerations  include:  divert  requirements,  cable availability, temperature, and density altitude.  Normal minimum fuel for takeoff is: 4.2.1.  Staged Show: 16,500 pounds 4.2.2.  High Show: 14,000 pounds 4.2.3.  Low Show: 13,000 pounds 4.3.  Airspeed and G Limits.  Demonstration pilots may not exceed 0.94 Mach. The maximum target G for this demonstration is 7.5 Gs. This does not preclude a momentary increase in G for safety considerations. 4.4.  Show  line  Restrictions.  The  majority  of  the  F-15E  demonstration  is  flown  on  the  1,500-foot  (1,200'  if  approved  by  the  FAA)  show  line.    Maneuvers  not  conforming  to  FAA  Order 8900.1,  Volume  3,  Chapter  6,  require  approval  via  the  FAA  AFS-800  Maneuver  Package approval process. 4.5.  Airspace  and  Runway  Requirements.  Required  airspace  for  the  F-15E  is  15,000  feet AGL and normally a five-mile radius from show center horizontally.  The minimum dimensions of the aerobatic box are 3,000 feet wide, 6,000 feet long, and 15,000 feet AGL (high show).  If the  FAA  has  waived  a  show  line  to  closer  than  1,500  feet,  the  aerobatic  box  may  be  less  than 3,000 feet wide, provided there is at least 1,200 feet from either the primary or secondary show line.  Minimum runway length is 7,000 feet x 75 feet.  Ensure the runway, taxiway, and parking area are stressed for a 62,000-pound aircraft with single wheel type landing gear. If needed, on a case by case basis, the absolute minimum weight allowable is 52,000-pounds with no CFT gas. 64 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 4.6.  Weather Requirements.  Weather PARAMETER LIMITS for the high profile are a ceiling of  at  least  5,000  feet,  three  miles  ground  and  five  miles  in-flight  visibility  with  a  discernible horizon.  The  low  show  profile  ceiling  is  at  least  2,500  feet.  The  flat  show  profile  ceiling  is  at least 1,500 feet. The ceiling requirements for each maneuver are based on waived airspace (clear of  clouds)  and  require  adjustment  if  using  VFR  rules.  Plan  maneuvers  to  maintain  VMC throughout the show sequence. 4.7.  High  Density  Altitude  Demonstrations.  For  high  density  altitude  shows,  adjust PARAMETER LIMITS in accordance with the following: 4.7.1.  Add 500 feet to APEX altitudes for each 2,000 feet of altitude above 3,000 feet MSL and 10 knots to airspeeds. For example, if the show site altitude is 5,000 feet MSL, add 500 feet to the baseline target and 10 knots to the airspeed. If the show site altitude is 7,000 feet MSL, add 1,000 feet to the baseline target and 20 knots to the airspeed. 4.8.  Demonstration Maneuver Profiles. 4.8.1.  High Show 4.8.1.1.

Repositioning turns may not include added aileron rolls or other accenting maneuvers. 66 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 Figure 4.1.  F-15E Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver.  4.9.1.  Flat  Wifferdill  Reposition  Maneuver.  The  Flat  Wifferdill  Maneuver  turn  is  a combination horizontal and shallow vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the show  line  when  performing  the  low  profile.    The  Flat  Wifferdill  Maneuver  turn  uses  less altitude  than  a  normal Wifferdill.    It  requires  a  larger  cut  and  tends  to  be  looser  and  flatter than  a  normal  Wifferdill.    270-degree  turn  reversal  may  be  made  while  the  aircraft  is climbing.  The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs.  Each turn may differ slightly so that airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the flat Wifferdill.  The entry "cut" turn for the flat Wifferdill is typically made away from the crowd.  However if local conditions dictate, the turn may be made toward the crowd side, provided the aircraft is  beyond  the  corner  marker  (500'  past  the  edge  of  the  crowd)  to  ensure  no  show  line  or crowd line penetration. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 67 Figure 4.2.  F-15E Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver.  4.9.2.  Wifferdill  Reposition  Maneuver.  The  Wifferdill  turn  is  a  combination  horizontal and vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the show line.  The vertical plane is used  to  maintain  necessary  proximity  to  the  demonstration  area.    Each  turn  may  differ slightly  so  that  airspeed/altitude  parameters  for  the  next  maneuver  are  established  in  the Wifferdill.    As  the  aircraft  departs  the  show  line,  maneuver  in  the  horizontal  and  vertical plane to reposition for the next maneuver.  The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs.  A 270-degree turn reversal is made while still climbing.  During the last half of the Wifferdill, while descending, the turn is adjusted to establish the proper show line entry.  The entry "cut" turn for the Wifferdill is typically made away from the crowd.  However if local conditions dictate,  the  turn  may  be  made  toward  the  crowd  side,  provided  the  aircraft  is  beyond  the corner  marker  (500'  past  the  edge  of  the  crowd)  to  ensure  no  show  line  or  crowd  line penetration. 68 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 Figure 4.3.

Vertical Reposition Maneuver:  The Vertical Reposition Maneuver may be flown to change  direction  at  each  end  of  the  1,500’  show  line.    Upon  passing  show  center  or  at  the completion of the previous maneuver with  a minimum of 350 knots, begin  a straight-ahead climb  using  6.5  to  7.0  Gs  to  put  the  aircraft  in  a  40  to  55-degree  nose-high  attitude.    At  a minimum  of  4,500  feet  AGL,  perform  an  unloaded  180-degree  roll  to  achieve  an  inverted climbing  attitude.    Initiate  a  smooth  pull  to  the  horizon  to  achieve  a  wings-level  inverted position  at  or  above  5,500  feet  AGL.    Continue  the  pull  in  maximum  power  though  the vertical, using 3.0-5.0 Gs to 135 degrees of turn (45 degrees nose-low).  As the nose drops below  the  horizon  and  the  airfield  environment  is  reacquired,  correct  as  necessary  to complete  the  Vertical  Reposition  Maneuver  down  the  show  line.    On  a  standard  day,  at  90 degrees  nose-low,  airspeed  should  be  between  300  to  400  knots  and  altitude  greater  than 4,000 feet AGL.  At 135 degrees, backpressure is relaxed and the aircraft smoothly flown to be  in  level  flight  at  500  feet  AGL  for  the  next  maneuver.    Aircraft  power  should  be modulated  through  the  vertical  to  achieve  the  desired  airspeed  upon  rollout  for  the  next maneuver. 4.9.3.1.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  not  within  the  target  airspeed  window,  adjust  pitch attitude  during  climb  to  achieve  desired  airspeed.    If  below  minimum  apex  altitude, maintain an inverted climb until reaching minimum apex altitude.  If you are below 4,000 feet AGL and over 400 knots prior to achieving 90 degrees nose-low, execute emergency dive recovery procedures.  If at any time during the maneuver it appears that the aircraft cannot  attain  the  prescribed  altitude/airspeed  parameter  limits,  abort  the  maneuver.  Reposition the aircraft for follow-on maneuvering. 70 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 Figure 4.4.  F-15E Flat Pass Reposition Maneuver. 4.9.4.  Flat  Pass  Reposition  Maneuver.

Maneuver Description:  The takeoff is performed with flaps and in full afterburner.  At  190  knots,  execute  a  smooth,  but  brisk  aft-pull  of  the  stick  to  achieve  takeoff  rotation.  After a positive rate of climb is established, retract the gear and flaps and rotate the nose to achieve a 23 to 25-unit AOA climb (max AOA 30 units).  Smoothly roll and pull away from the crowd to a wings-level inverted position with afterburners pointing directly at the crowd.  Hold inverted flight for approximately five seconds, accelerate to 250 to 400 knots, and then perform a 270-degree right turn to position for the Flat Pass.  Minimum airspeed in the climb is  190 knots;  minimum  altitude inverted is 800 feet  AGL.     Option:    From  inverted  flight, roll 180 degrees to a wings-level upright position.  Delay for approximately 3-5 seconds, and then perform a right 270-degree roll to position for the Four-Point Roll. 4.10.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  the  show  profile  takeoff  is  interrupted  by  an  aircraft malfunction,  make  a  normal  takeoff,  or  if  conditions  warrant,  abort  the  takeoff.      NOTES:  The  Max  Performance  Takeoff/Inverted  may  be  flown  in  either  direction.            A  normal takeoff  may  be  flown  in  place  of  the  Max  Performance  Takeoff  (Climb  and  Inverted)  if required.    Reasons  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  weather  (ceiling,  visibility,  winds)  and field  conditions  (rising  terrain,  high  density  altitudes,  etc.).    If  flying  the  normal  takeoff  to accomplish  a  weather  check  before  starting  the  actual  profile,  start  the  show  from  a  staged position. 4.11.  Flat Pass. Figure 4.6.

Maneuver  Description:  Beyond  the  500’  show  line  and  approximately  3,000  feet prior  to  show  center,  select  full  AB  and  accelerate  to  approximately  450  knots.    At  show center, turn away from the crowd using approximately 75 to 85 degrees of bank.  Begin the turn with a smooth G-onset-rate to maintain airspeed at approximately 350 knots and 7.5 Gs.  G-loading  and  airspeed  bleed-off  rate  vary  with  density  altitude.    The  first  180  degrees  of turn should be accomplished with a 1 ¾ degree nose-up attitude and the last 180 degrees of turn should be accomplished with a 1 ¾ degree nose-down attitude to make the turn appear level to the crowd.  Vary the bank angle and pitch to arrive at level flight at the completion of 360 degrees of turn and to ensure the maneuver is finished on or beyond the 1,500’ show line and above the  entry altitude.  Ensure surface winds are taken into consideration in  order to center this maneuver on show center and to avoid overshooting the show line. 4.12.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  the  minimum  entry  parameters  are  not  met,  the  pilot transitions  to  a  wings-level  flat  pass.    If  during  any  portion  of  the  maneuver  it  becomes apparent the aircraft is descending below 400 feet AGL or airspeed decays below 300 knots, abort  the  maneuver  by  rolling  wings-level  and  climbing  to  500  feet  AGL.    If  necessary, adjust  power  and  G  as  required  (no  lower  than  300  knots)  to  avoid  overshooting  the  show line. 4.13.

Maneuver Description:  At 4,000 feet prior to show center on the 1,500’ show line with  425  knots  and  a  minimum  of  500  feet  AGL,  raise  the  nose  eight  degrees,  establish  a climb, and relax stick pressure.  Apply full left-stick pressure to perform a maximum of three consecutive unloaded aileron rolls.  As the second roll is completed, it is important to ensure the aircraft has gained altitude and the nose is still above the horizon.  At the completion of the third roll, roll out and reposition for the Four-Point Roll. 4.13.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  If starting parameters are not achieved, abort maneuver and transition  to  a  flat  pass.    If  the  nose  drops  below  level  inverted  on  the  second  roll  or  roll-coupling occurs (to exceed approximately 2.5 G) immediately roll wings-level and climb to minimum altitude. 4.14.

Maneuver Description:  At 4,000 feet prior to show center on the 1,500’ show line, smoothly  pull  the  nose  to  five  degrees  up,  establish  a  climb,  and  relax  stick  pressure.    A cadenced  four-point  roll  to  the  left  is  then  performed  by  pausing  momentarily  at  the  90-degree,  180-degree,  270-degree,  and  360-degree  points.    Move  the  stick  briskly,  causing  a left  roll  and  an  immediate  stop  at  each  point  when  pressure  is  released.    The  pace  of  the cadence should ensure the aircraft is at the 180-degree point over show center. 4.14.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  starting  parameter  limits  are  not  achieved,  abort maneuver and transition to a flat pass.

Maneuver  Description:  Following  the  Four-Point  Roll,  reposition  the  aircraft  and descend  to  fly  wings-level  down  the  1,500-foot  show  line  at  500  feet  AGL  and  400  knots.  Approximately  3,000  feet  past  show  center,  begin  a  brisk  but  smooth  wings-level  pull  to approximately  25-units  AOA.    Normal  apex  altitude  is  above  4,500  feet  AGL.    At  apex altitude, reduce power.   Airspeed should be 150-250 knots.  The pull is  held  until  the nose passes  through  125-140  degrees  of  pitch  where  the  backpressure  is  eased  to  maintain  a constant  nose  track  of  25-45  degrees  nose-low  inverted.    The  25  to  45-degree  nose-low inverted  attitude  is  held  until  approximately  3,000  feet  AGL  and  airspeed  should  be approximately  300  knots.    At  3,000  feet  AGL,  advance  throttles  to  MIL  and  perform  an unloaded  roll  to  wings-level  upright.    Roll  the  aircraft  as  necessary  to  maintain  proper alignment along the show line (wind  correction).  Gradually increase back-stick pressure to ensure aircraft does not  descend below 500 AGL.  At no later than 1,200 feet AGL initiate full afterburner and begin a brisk but smooth wings-level pull to approximately 25-unit AOA.  The second half is completed in the opposite direction using the procedures described earlier. 4.15.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  If either or both afterburners fail to light abort maneuver by decreasing pitch attitude to level flight and investigate malfunction.  If apex airspeed is less than 175 knots, decrease back-stick pressure and accelerate to target airspeed before reducing throttles  and  pulling  nose  through  horizon.    If  desired  pitch  attitude  is  exceeded  while inverted, roll upright and set desired pitch angle and continue maneuver.  If less than 2,500 feet AGL while inverted, initiate an immediate roll and pull to wings-level. If at any time it becomes  apparent  that  the  maneuver  is  going  to  be  completed  inside  the  show  line  (poor wind correction, improper alignment), abort the maneuver and set up for the next pass. 4.16.

Maneuver  Description:  After performing a reposition maneuver, align the aircraft to  fly  down  the  1,500’  line.    At  6,000’  from  show  center  roll  and  pull  to  a  20-degree  dive angle.    The  dive  angle  is  normally  10  –  25  degrees  nose-low  depending  on  winds.    The 82 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 optimum dive angle is 20 degrees.  Do not exceed 25 degrees.  Recovery should be initiated at 1,000 - 800 feet AGL using a max performance pull in order to bottom out at or above 300 feet AGL.  Be careful not to over-G the aircraft during this pull.  In order to make this corner, you  need  to  obtain  a  minimum  of  400  knots.  After  recovering  to  level  flight,  accomplish  a reposition  maneuver  to  set  up  for  the  LAHD  Bomb  Pass.    Use  the  1,500-foot  show  line  at show center as a reference point, and offset the pyro area at least 150 feet. 4.16.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  entry  parameter  limits  are  not  met,  abort  the  maneuver and  perform  a  wings-level  pass.    If  at  any  time  the  dive  angle  exceeds  25  degrees,  either abort the pass and fly through straight and level or shift the aim point longer and parallel to the show line until the dive angle is 25 degrees or less.  Check airspeed at 1,500 feet AGL.  If it is not at least 375 knots, abort the pass and fly through straight and level. 4.17.  LAHD Bomb Pass (Right to Left). Figure 4.12.

Maneuver  Description:  After  performing  the  Low  Angle  Strafe  Pass,  continue straight and level to approximately 3,000 feet past show center, then begin a 40 to 50-degree turn away from the crowd starting a slight climb to apex around 1,000 feet AGL accelerating to approximately 450 knots.  At approximately 2.5 miles from show center, make a flat turn and pull to  a point to  begin  a  run-in  at  500  feet  AGL and 20-30 degrees off the show line.  Align  the  aircraft  to  fly  slightly  offset  the  preplanned  bombing  target/point,  away  from  the crowd.    Do  not  allow  a  vector  towards  the  crowd!    At  approximately  1.3  miles  from  the target,  pull  up  to  20-40  degrees  nose-high.    Passing  approximately  1,500  feet  AGL  and approaching  the  run-in  on  the  500-foot  show  line,  roll-in  on  the  target.    The  dive  angle  is normally  10  –  25  degrees  nose-low  depending  on  winds.    The  optimum  dive  angle  is  20 degrees.  Do not exceed 25 degrees.  Recovery should be initiated at 1,000 feet AGL using a max performance pull in order to  bottom  out  at  or above 400 feet  AGL.   Be careful not  to over-G  the  aircraft  during  this  pull.    In  order  to  make  this  corner,  you  need  to  obtain  a minimum of 400 knots.  Use the 500-foot show line at show center as a reference point, and offset the pyro area at least 150 feet.  After recovering to level flight, accomplish a reposition maneuver to set up for the SAM Weave. 4.17.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  entry  parameter  limits  are  not  met,  abort  the  maneuver and  perform  a  wings-level  pass.    If  at  any  time  the  dive  angle  exceeds  25  degrees,  either abort the pass and fly through straight and level or shift the aim point longer and parallel to the show line until the dive angle is 25 degrees or less.

Maneuver  Description:  After performing the LAHD Bomb Pass recovery to level flight, begin a right 30 to70-degree turn away from the crowd ensuring a slight climb away from the ground.  The bank angle should be approximately 70-90 degrees ensuring you are at or  above  500  feet  AGL  and  beyond  the  1,500’  show  line  at  the  end  of  the  turn.    Rapidly unload the jet and roll left 135 degrees and use a max performance pull into the oblique 10-20  degrees  nose-high.    Then  rapidly  unload  and  roll  the  jet  180  degrees  to  the  right  and perform a maximum pull to 10-20 degrees nose-low into the oblique.  Once reaching 10-20 degrees nose-low, rapidly unload, and roll upright to pull up into a normal reposition for the Dedication Pass. 4.18.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  entry  parameter  limits  are  not  met,  abort  the  maneuver and perform a normal reposition maneuver.  If at any time the dive angle exceeds 25 degrees nose-low,  immediately  transition  to  a  level  pull  to  the  reposition  maneuver.    At  no  time should airspeed drop below 300 knots or should the jet be lower than 400 feet AGL.  If the airspeed drops below 300 knots in the climb, accelerate uphill prior to pull down. 4.19.

Maneuver  Description:  The  maneuver  is  flown  beyond  the  500-foot  line.  Following the Sam Weave (high or low show), or Level 8 (flat show), attain a safe airspeed and  reposition  the  aircraft  to  arrive  behind  and  offset  the  crowd.    Fly  the  approach  from behind the line, approximately 2 miles from show center, with an approximate 30 degree dive angle and a 45 degree cut (bank angle 75 to 90 degrees) to the show line, remaining beyond 500 feet from the crowd at all times. Upon reaching a point 500 feet from the corner of the crowd and 300 feet  AGL, roll the aircraft into a level  arcing pass  using a bank of 75 to  90 degrees.  Use top rudder if necessary to maintain altitude.  Select mil power until passing the show line or until a target airspeed of .85M is anticipated.  Use varying pressure altitudes and temperatures  to  determine  when  to  deselect  afterburner  to  ensure  the  target  airspeed  is attained  at  show  center  and  the  max  airspeed  is  not  exceeded.  Ensure  military  power  is selected prior to entering the arcing pass and through the exit of the maneuver.  Do not use afterburner  during  the  arcing  pass.    Optimum  profile  of  the  aircraft  is  achieved  at approximately 80 degrees of bank.  Use caution not  to  over-bank the aircraft and allow the aircraft to lose altitude while banking.  In order to maintain 500 feet from the crowd at each corner,  ensure  the  flight  path  at  show  center  extends  beyond  500  feet.  Continue  the  arc beyond the opposite crowd corner, reduce power as required, roll out of bank, and continue a maximum 45-degree climb to set up for the Knife Edge Pass. 4.19.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  Abort the maneuver if at any time the aircraft comes closer than 500’ to the crowd line or its lateral limits, an excessive dive angle or sink rate develops, entry  parameters  are  not  met,  or  the  aircraft  descends  below  200  feet  AGL.    Abort  the maneuver by rolling the aircraft wings-level and flying away from the crowd. 4.20.  Knife Edge Pass. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 87 Figure 4.15.  F-15E Knife Edge Pass (Right to Left).

Maneuver Description:  Enter the 1,500’ show line at 500 feet AGL and 400 knots.  At 8,000 to 6,000 feet prior to show center, raise the nose three to five degrees, establish a climb, and apply stick pressure to roll 90 degrees toward the crowd.  The aircraft is held in this position  until 8,000 to  6,000 feet  past  show center.  Top rudder is  applied to  help  hold the  nose  above  the  horizon  so  the  full  maneuver  can  be  accomplished.    Forward  stick pressure is applied to keep the aircraft on the show line and to maintain level flight. 4.20.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  If entry parameters are not met, abort the maneuver, make a flat  pass,  and  reposition  for  the  next  maneuver.    If  the  nose  falls  below  level  flight  (zero degrees  pitch  in  the  HUD)  or  if  the  aircraft  descends  below  400  feet  AGL,  abort  the maneuver. 4.21.

Maneuver Description:  Approach show center on the 1,500’ show line, wings-level at 500 knots and 300 feet AGL.  At 3,500 feet prior to show center select full afterburner and initiate a 6 to 7.5-G wings-level pull to arrive at show center with 90 degrees of pitch.  The pull should be made so the aircraft is vertical at  show center.  When the aircraft is vertical, perform high-rate unloaded aileron rolls until reaching a minimum of 250 knots or 3,000 feet below waivered airspace.  Stop the aileron rolls and execute a vertical recovery by smoothly pulling  the  nose  to  the  nearest  horizon.    Deselect  afterburner  and  modulate  power  as necessary to set up for the spiral descent. 4.21.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If entry parameters are not met at 3,000 feet prior to show center, delay until entry  parameters are met.  If entry parameters are not  met prior to 2,000 feet  past  show  center,  abort  the  maneuver  and  reposition  for  the  next  pass.    If  the  airspeed decreases below 150 knots in the climb, initiate a vertical recovery 4.22.  Spiral Descent. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 91 Figure 4.17.  F-15E Spiral Descent. Table 4.14.

Maneuver  Description:  As  the  aircraft  nose  is  brought  through  the  horizon, reacquire  the  air  show  environment.    In  idle  power,  perform  a  vertical  spiraling  descent oriented toward show center.  Initiate dive recovery to recover by 6,000 feet AGL.  Do not exceed 450 knots in the descent.  The direction of the dive recovery should be as necessary to reposition for the next maneuver, however do not exit the maneuver over the crowd. 4.22.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  entry  airspeed  window  is  not  met  (too  fast)  adjust  dive angle  to  minimize  airspeed  in  the  descent.    If  below  12,000  AGL  at  the  apex  of  the  climb (airspace  restrictions, weather  conditions), adjust  dive angle to  safely  execute a recovery at 6,000  AGL.    When  initiating  the  spiral  descent  at  altitudes  above  15,000  AGL,  adjust minimum  dive  recovery  altitude  accordingly.    (If  starting  at  18,000’  AGL,  initiate  dive recovery at  9,000 AGL)    Initiate  an immediate dive recovery if  airspeed is at/or above 450 knots.  Show center orientation is a secondary consideration in the spiral descent.  If at any time  during  the  maneuver  it  appears  that  the  aircraft  is  not  attaining  the  prescribed altitude/airspeed  parameters,  abort  the  maneuver.    Roll  out  and/or  pull  to  a  wings-level position, initiate a descent and reposition the aircraft for follow-on maneuvering.   Option:  Due to changing weather conditions, the vertical spiraling descent may not be possible after the  Max  Climb.    Start  a  descent  when  able  to  maintain  VMC  conditions  to  position  the aircraft to set up for the next maneuver. 4.23.

Smoothly  pull  the  nose  five  degrees  up, establish  a  climb,  and  relax  stick  pressure.    Perform  an  unloaded  405-degree  aileron  roll followed  by  an  aggressive  pull-up  to  downwind.    During  the  pull  to  downwind,  terminate afterburner and slow to below 300 knots.  Configure for and execute a normal final turn and landing. 4.23.1.1.

Maneuver  Description:  At  approximately  2,500  feet  past  show  center,  select  full afterburner  and  accelerate  to  approximately  450  knots.    Turn  away  from  the  crowd  using approximately 85 degrees of bank (<75 degrees inside the 1,500’ show line).  Begin the turn with a smooth G onset-rate to maintain airspeed at approximately 350-400 knots and 5 to 7 Gs.  G-loading and airspeed bleed-off rate varies with density altitude.  Maintain a minimum of 300 knots.  The first 180 degrees of turn should be accomplished with a 1¾-degree nose-up attitude to make the turn appear level to the crowd.  After 225 degrees of turn, unload and briskly  roll  wings-level.    Approaching  the  show  line,  reverse  direction  of  turn  and accomplish  a second level  turn in  the opposite direction.  Adjust power to enter the second turn  with  the  same  entry  parameters  as  the  first.    Fly  the  second  turn  using  the  same techniques as the first.  After 270 degrees and with a 45-degree cut to the show line, reverse the turn again.  Vary the bank angle and pitch to arrive at level flight at the completion of the maneuver  and  to  ensure  the  maneuver  is  finished  above  the  entry  altitude.    Ensure  surface winds  are  taken  into  careful  consideration  to  center  the  maneuver  over  show  center  and  to avoid overshooting the show line. Complete the maneuver by turning as required to finish on the show line heading the same direction as entry.  Perform a repositioning maneuver to set up for the next maneuver. 4.29.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  Adjust power and G as required to avoid overshooting the show line.  If the aircraft descends below 500 feet AGL, reorient lift vector to ensure a timely correction.    If  the  aircraft  descends  below  400  feet  AGL  or  the  airspeed  decays  below  300 knots,  abort  the  maneuver  by  rolling  wings-level,  climbing  to  500  feet  AGL,  and repositioning for the follow-on maneuver. 4.30.

When  demonstration  aircraft  takeoff  from  other  than  the  show  site,  plan  to  arrive over  the  show  site  with  the  fuel  requirements  prescribed  in  paragraph    4.2  plus  enroute return  fuel  IAW  AFI  11-2F-15E,  Vol  3.    The  pilot  may  enter  from  behind  the  crowd  at  a minimum of 1,000 ft AGL as depicted in Figure 4.20, or via a Flat Pass maneuver down the  98 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 show line, and complete the show as described in this chapter.  Upon completion of the last pass  and  clearing  the  crowd,  turn  out  behind  the  crowd  and  return  to  the  staging  airport.  Pilots  should  plan  to  fly  a  full  demonstration,  but  may  cut  the  profile  short  as  required  to maintain suitable enroute return fuel. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 99 Chapter 5 F-16 DEMONSTRATION MANEUVERS Section 5A—-General Information 5.1.  General.  Use  maneuvers  described  in  this  chapter  for  training  and  for  F-16  aerial demonstrations. The demonstration sequence is designed so all of the maneuvers up to the High Alpha Pass are performed in the same direction with respect to the crowd line. The High Alpha Pass  is  designed  to  be  flown  against  the  wind.  Abnormal  procedures  are  written  for  each maneuver. If the entry conditions are not met for any maneuver, a wings-level pass is flown and the  pilot  transitions  to  the  next  maneuver.  Demonstration  pilots  transmit  parameters  prior  to initiating  the  descending  portion  of  vertical  pull-throughs  for  the  Split-S,  Shark’s  Tooth,  and Vertical  Reposition  maneuvers.  These  calls  are  made  when  the  pilot  reaches  apex  of  the maneuver. The ground safety observer monitors demonstration pilot altitude and airspeed radio calls,  and  directs  an  abort  when  parameter  limits  are  exceeded.  Following  all  maneuvers  and before clearing the show line to reposition for the next maneuver, the pilot ensures any descent has been stopped and the aircraft is in a climbing or level attitude with the flight path marker at or above the horizon. 5.2.  Aircraft  Configuration  and  Fuel  Requirements.  Ensure  aircraft  configuration  for  all demonstrations is clean (no wing pylons or missiles except wingtip smoke winders) and internal fuel.  Fuel  considerations  include:  divert  requirements,  cable  availability,  temperature,  and density altitude. Normal minimum fuel for take-off is: 5.2.1.  Staged Show: 6,000 pounds. 5.2.2.  High Show: 5,000 pounds. 5.2.3.  Low Show: 4,000 pounds. 5.3.  Airspeed and G Limits.  Demonstration pilots may not exceed 0.94 Mach. The maximum target G for this demonstration profile is 7.5 Gs. This does not preclude a momentary increase in G for safety considerations. 5.4.  Show  line  Restrictions.  The  majority  of  the  F-16  demonstration  is  flown  on  the  1,500- foot show line.  Maneuvers not conforming to FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 6, require approval via the FAA AFS-800 Maneuver Package approval process. 5.5.  Airspace and Runway Requirements.  Required airspace for the F-16 is 15,000 feet AGL and  normally  a  five-mile  radius  from  show  center.  The  minimum  dimensions  of  the  aerobatic box are 3,000 feet wide, 6,000 feet long, and up to 15,000 feet AGL (high show). If the FAA has waived a show line to closer than 1,500 feet, the aerobatic box may be less than 3,000 feet wide, provided there is  at  least 1,200 feet  from  either the primary or secondary show line. Minimum runway length is 7,000 feet and width is 75 feet. Ensure the runway, taxiway, and parking area are stressed for a 30,000-pound aircraft with single wheel type landing gear. 5.6.  Weather Requirements.  Weather PARAMETER LIMITS for the high profile are a ceiling of at least 7,000 feet and three miles ground and five miles in-flight visibility with a discernible horizon. The Low Show profile requires 1,500' and 5 miles in-flight visibility with a discernable horizon.  The  ceiling  requirements  for  each  maneuver  are  based  on  waived  airspace  (clear  of 100 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 clouds) and require adjustment if using VFR rules. Plan maneuvers to maintain VMC throughout the show sequence. 5.7.  High  Density  Altitude  Demonstrations.  For  high  density  altitude  shows,  adjust PARAMETER LIMITS in accordance with the following: 5.7.1.  Add 500 feet to APEX altitudes for each 2,000 feet of altitude above 3,000 feet MSL and 10 knots to airspeeds. For example, if the show site altitude is 5,000 feet MSL, add 500 feet to the baseline target and 10 knots to the airspeed. If the show site altitude is 7,000 feet MSL, add 1,000 feet to the baseline target and 20 knots to the airspeed. 5.8.  Demonstration Maneuver Profiles. 5.8.1.  High Show 5.8.1.1.

Repositioning turns may not include added aileron rolls or other accenting maneuvers. Figure 5.1.  F-16 Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. 5.9.1.  Flat  Wifferdill  Reposition  Maneuver.  The  Flat  Wifferdill  Maneuver  turn  is  a combination horizontal and shallow vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the show  line  when  performing  the  low  profile.  The  Flat  Wifferdill  Maneuver  turn  uses  less altitude  than  a  normal  reposition.  It  requires  a  larger  cut  and  tends  to  be  looser  and  flatter than  a  normal  turn.  The  target  G  for  this  maneuver  is  6.5  to  7.0  Gs.  A  270-degree  turn reversal  may  be  made  while  the  aircraft  is  climbing.  Each  turn  may  differ  slightly  so  that airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the flat reposition. The entry  "cut"  turn  for  the  flat  reposition  is  made  to  ensure  no  show  line  or  crowd  line penetration.  102 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 Figure 5.2.  F-16 Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver.  5.9.2.  Wifferdill  Reposition  Maneuver.  This  maneuver  is  a  combination  horizontal  and vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the show line. The vertical plane is used to  maintain  proximity  to  the  demonstration  area.  Each  turn  may  differ  slightly  so  that airspeed/ altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the turn. As the aircraft departs the show line, maneuver in the horizontal and vertical plane to reposition for the next maneuver.  The  Target  G  for  this  maneuver  is  6.0  to  7.0  Gs.  A  270-degree  rolling  turn reversal is made while still climbing. During the last half of the maneuver, while descending, the  turn  is  adjusted  to  establish  the  proper  show  line  entry.  The  entry  "cut"  turn  for  the reposition is made to ensure no show line or crowd line penetration. 5.9.2.1.  Abnormal Procedures:  Consider weather, terrain, obstacles, and winds into the show line when determining how much vertical and horizontal turning room is necessary for the reposition. 5.9.3.

Maneuver  Description:  Fly the vertical  reposition to  change direction at  each end  of  the  1,500’  show  line  during  a  high  show.  Upon  passing  show  center  or  at  the completion of the previous maneuver, a straight-ahead climb is commenced using a 6.0 to 7.0  G  pull  to  put  the  aircraft  in  a  55-degree  nose  high  attitude.  For  slower  entry parameters,  use  G  as  required  to  maintain  a  minimum  of  150  KIAS.  Power  setting  is based  upon  entry  parameters  to  ensure  a  minimum  airspeed  of  150  KIAS  in  the  climb. Pitch attitude may be reduced as well to hold airspeed. At a minimum of 3,000 feet AGL, the aircraft is rolled inverted and the demonstration pilot unloads the aircraft to attain or exceed the apex target altitude. Once apex parameters are assured, initiate an aggressive 135-degree  pull  through  the  vertical,  to  approximately  45  degrees  nose  low.  The  peak altitude  reached  is  a  minimum  of  5,000  feet  AGL  with  a  target  of  5,500  feet  AGL. Modulate  the  throttle  as required  to  initiate  the  pull  down  with  a  target  airspeed  of  275 KIAS. Once recovery above the minimum altitude for the follow on maneuver is assured, backpressure is relaxed and the aircraft is smoothly flown to be in level flight at the entry altitude for the next maneuver.  In no circumstances should the demonstration pilot play the G during the 135-degree pull through the vertical. 5.9.3.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  entry  parameters  are  not  attained,  reposition  in  the oblique  for  follow-on  maneuvers.  If  apex  parameters  are  not  achieved  with  regard  to airspeed or altitude, immediately recover the aircraft to the nearest horizon and abort the split-S. If the airspeed exceeds 350 KIAS during any portion of the dive or is below 3,000 feet  AGL  at  90  degrees  nose-low,  immediately  initiate  a  dive  recovery  to  the  nearest horizon. 5.9.4.  Flat Pass. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 105 Figure 5.4.  F-16 Flat Pass. NOTE:  May be flown either direction.   5.9.4.1.  Maneuver Description:  The flat pass is a repositioning maneuver used alone or in  combination  with  an  oblique  reposition  for  the  primary  purpose  of  orienting  the subsequent demonstration maneuver in the approved direction relative to the crowd line. The  Flat  Pass  may  be  flown  in  either  direction  at  any  time  during  the  demonstration sequence if required. It should be flown IAW paragraphictect5.11. Section 5B—-High Profile 5.10.

Maneuver  Description:  Do  not  attempt  takeoff  when  the  takeoff  roll  exceeds  80 percent of available runway. The takeoff is made in full afterburner. After takeoff, establish a positive rate of climb and raise the gear, at a minimum of 300 knots begin a wings-level 4.0 to  6.0-G  pull.  Hold  the  pull  until  90  degrees  of  pitch,  then  release  the  backpressure  to approximately  2.5  G  until  25  to  35  degrees  nose-high  inverted.  Play  the  backpressure  to ensure  the  over-the-top  airspeed  and  altitude  are  above  150  knots  and  3,000  feet  AGL. Continue  the  pull  until  25  to  45  degrees  nose-low  inverted.  Unload  to  hold  pitch,  deselect afterburner,  and perform an unloaded 1/2  roll to  a wings-level  upright.  At  2,000 feet  AGL, modulate power as required and begin a four to six-G wings-level pull to arrive on the show line at 500 feet AGL with 350 knots. Accomplish the second half of a Cuban 8 using entry airspeed  of  approximately  350  knots,  an  entry  pull  of  4.0  to  6.0  Gs  and  over-the-top minimum of 150 knots. The descending portion of the second half is accomplished exactly as the  descending  portion  of  the  first  half.      NOTE:    If  airfield  runway  alignment  or  takeoff considerations  drive  a  crowd  right-to-left  takeoff,  the  pilot  may  execute  an  immediate reposition to re-enter the appropriate show line from  crowd left to accomplish the complete maneuver. 5.10.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If entry parameters are not attained, clear the show line in front of the crowd. If at any time during the maneuver it appears the minimum over-the-top altitude or airspeed parameters cannot be met, abort the maneuver by performing an unloaded roll  to  the  wings-level  upright  position  accelerating  to  250  knots  in  afterburner  and continuing  down  the  show  line.  If  desired  pitch  attitude  is  exceeded  while  inverted,  roll upright and set desired pitch angle and continue maneuver. If less than 2,500 feet AGL while inverted, initiate an immediate roll and pull to wings-level. If at any time it becomes apparent that  the  maneuver  is  going  to  be  completed  inside  the  show  line  (poor  wind  correction, improper alignment), abort the maneuver and set up for the next pass. 5.11.

Maneuver Description:  On the 1,500’ show line, at 3,500 feet prior to show center with approximately 425 knots raise the nose to 5-7 degrees pitch attitude, establish a climb, and  relax  stick  pressure  to  approximately  0.8  Gs.  Apply  left-stick  pressure  to  perform  a maximum  of  three  consecutive  unloaded  aileron  rolls.  Crosscheck  the  horizon  and  audibly count the rolls during the maneuver. As you complete the second roll, ensure the aircraft has gained altitude and that the flight path marker is above the horizon line in the HUD. If not, abort the maneuver and recover the aircraft above the minimum altitude. If you lose count of the number of rolls or experience roll-coupling immediately abort the maneuver. In all cases, complete  the  rolls  at  a  higher  altitude  than  entry.  After  rolling  out  wings-level  upon completion  of  the  third  roll,  smoothly  apply  aft-stick  pressure  as  required  to  finish  the maneuver  at  entry  altitude  (the  objective  of  the  maneuver  is  to  make  the  pass  look symmetrical  to  the  crowd).  Then  perform  a  repositioning  maneuver  to  prepare  for  the  next maneuver. 5.12.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  If the minimum entry parameters are not met transition to a wings-level  flat  pass.  At  wings-level  following  the  second  roll,  abort  the  maneuver  if  the flight path marker is not above the horizon line. Abort the maneuver if you lose count of the rolls during the sequence. 5.13.  High-G Turn (Right to Left). AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 111 Figure 5.8.  F-16 High-G Turn.  Table 5.5.

Maneuver  Description:  Beyond  the  500’  show  line  and  just  prior  to  show  center select full AB and accelerate to 400 knots. At show center, turn away from the crowd using 75  to  85  degrees  of  bank  (<75  degrees  inside  the  1,500’  show  line).  Begin  the  turn  with  a smooth  G  onset-rate  to  approximately  7.5  Gs.  G-loading  and  airspeed  bleed-off  rate  vary with density altitude. Maintain a minimum of 250 knots. The first 180 degrees of turn should be  accomplished  with  a  1¾-degree  nose-up  attitude  and  the  last  180  degrees  should  be accomplished  with  a  1¾-degree  nose-down  attitude  to  make  the  turn  appear  level  to  the crowd.  Vary  the  bank  angle  and  pitch  to  arrive  at  level  flight  at  the  completion  of  360 degrees  of  turn  and  to  ensure  the  maneuver  is  finished  above  the  entry  altitude.  Ensure surface  winds  are  taken  into  consideration  in  order  to  center  this  maneuver  on  show  center and to avoid overshooting the show line. As you approach show center, smoothly but briskly roll out. Perform a repositioning maneuver to prepare for the next maneuver. 5.13.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  the  minimum  entry  parameters  are  not  met,  the  pilot transitions  to  a  wings-level  flat  pass.  If  during  any  portion  of  the  maneuver  it  becomes apparent the aircraft may descend below 400 feet AGL or airspeed decay below 250 knots, abort the maneuver by rolling wings-level and climbing to 500 feet AGL. If necessary, adjust power and G as required (no lower than 250 knots) to avoid overshooting the show line. 5.14.  Four-Point Roll (Left to Right). AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 113 Figure 5.9.

Maneuver Description:  On the 1,500’ show line, at 3,000 feet prior to show center, rotate the nose five to seven degrees nose-up, establish a climb, and relax stick pressure. A cadence four-point roll to the left is then performed by pausing momentarily at the 90-degree, 180-degree,  270-degree,  and  360-degree  points.  The  pace  of  the  cadence  should  ensure  the aircraft is at the 180-degree point over show center. In all cases, complete the roll at a higher altitude than it starts. Move the stick briskly, initiating a left roll and an immediate stop at the proper  90-degree  point  when  pressure  is  released.  Upon  returning  to  wings-level,  smoothly apply aft-stick pressure as required to finish the maneuver at entry altitude (the objective of the maneuver is to make the pass look symmetrical to the crowd). At the completion of the pass, a repositioning maneuver is performed to set up for the next maneuver. 5.14.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  the  minimum  entry  parameters  are  not  met,  the  pilot transitions to a wings-level flat pass. If the flight path marker is below the horizon line at the wings-level inverted position, make an immediate roll to the upright position (abort), clearing the show line past the end of the crowd line. 5.15.

Maneuver Description:  This maneuver may be initiated at the 500-foot show line. Enter  the  show  line  at  500  feet  AGL  and  400  knots.  Just  prior  to  show  center  select  full afterburner and perform a 6.5 to 7.5-G slightly climbing turn (20 to 30 degrees pitch angle) left  away  from  the  crowd.  After  90  degrees  of  turn,  reverse  the  direction  of  the  turn  to  the right  by  unloading  and  rolling  under  180  degrees.  Perform  a  6.5  to  7.5-G  right  slightly descending turn (10 to 20 degrees nose-low) for 270 degrees rolling out heading the opposite direction with a minimum of 250 knots. Accelerate down the show line at 500 feet AGL in preparation for the next maneuver. 5.16.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  the  minimum  entry  parameters  are  not  met,  the  pilot transitions  to  a  wings-level  flat  pass.  If  during  any  portion  of  the  maneuver  it  becomes apparent  the  aircraft  may  descend  below  400  feet  AGL  or  overshoot  30  degrees  nose-low, abort  the  maneuver  by  rolling  wings-level  and  climbing  to  500  feet  AGL.  If  it  becomes apparent the aircraft may overshoot the show line, use airspeed and G as required (no lower than 250 knots) to prevent the overshoot.

Maneuver  Description:  (High  Show  Only.  If  ceiling  is  less  than  7,000'  AGL transition to the high alpha pass following the Falcon Turn.) This maneuver is a three-sided square loop with the third corner at a 135-degree angle. It avoids the pure vertical recovery in the  last  corner  of  a  normal  square  loop.  On  the  1,500’  show  line,  at  2,000  feet  past  show center, select afterburner and perform a 6.5 to 7.5-G pull to 90 degrees nose-high. Maintain full afterburner in the climb to 4,500 feet AGL, and then perform a 5.0 to 7.0-G pull of 90 degrees  to  inverted.  Roll  out  to  wings-level  upright  and  maintain  250  knots.  At  2,000  feet past show center, roll inverted, select power as required and perform a 5.0 to 7.0-G pull to 90 degrees nose-low. Approaching 4,500 feet to 3,500 feet AGL, at a maximum of 350 KIAS, continue  to  pull  to  45  degrees  nose-low  upright.  Hold  until  reaching  2,000  feet  AGL,  and then  perform  a  descending  turn  away  from  the  crowd.  Turn  left  or  right  to  set  up  on  the appropriate 1,000 feet downwind for the High Alpha pass into the wind. 5.17.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  the  minimum  entry  parameters  are  not  met,  the  pilot transitions  to  a  wings-level  flat  pass.  Do  not  attempt  to  pull  down  from  the  inverted  apex below  5,000  feet  AGL  or  with  more  than  350  KIAS.  If  out  of  the  maneuver  envelope, perform a roll to wings-level upright and make a descending turn away from the crowd to set up on a downwind position for the High Alpha pass. At 90 degrees nose-low, max airspeed is 350  KIAS  and  minimum  altitude  is  3,000  feet  AGL.  If  either  is  exceeded,  execute  a  dive recovery IAW tech order procedures. 5.18.

Maneuver  Description:  During  the  turn  to  the  500-foot  show  line  following  the shark’s tooth maneuver,  use speed brakes  and G  as required to  gradually  slow the airspeed and attain 125 knots and 500’ AGL by 2,000 feet prior to show center. As the aircraft rolls out on the show line, ensure the speed brakes are retracted, smoothly bring the nose up and use  power  as  required  to  achieve  the  target  parameters.  Use  the  Gun  Cross  in  the  HUD  in relation  to  the  pitch  ladders  to  achieve  the  target  AOA.  As  a  technique,  select  VVI  in  the HUD to help achieve level flight, as the tendency is to climb during the maneuver. Maintain the  desired  ground  track  by  looking  out  the  sides  of  the  canopy  and  cross  checking  the desired  heading  in  the  HUD  and/or  HSI.  To  complete  the  maneuver,  select  full  afterburner and transition to the muscle climb. 5.18.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  If the minimum entry parameters are not met transition to a wings-level flat pass. If the airspeed falls below 115 knots or a descent rate develops, select full afterburner and perform a normal go-around procedure. 5.19.

Maneuver Description:  Passing show center, simultaneously select full afterburner and  pull  up  to  establish  up  to  a  55-degree  nose-high  attitude  using  1.5  –  1.8  Gs.  For  Low profile,  vary  nose  position  consistent  with  weather.  The  afterburner  has  to  light  in  order  to execute  this  maneuver  and  allow  the  aircraft  to  accelerate  to  maintain  a  minimum  of  150 KIAS in the climb. Pitch attitude may be reduced to hold airspeed. The demonstration pilot may then transition to a Wifferdill or Vertical Reposition Maneuver (VRM) as required when adjusting to the show line for subsequent maneuvers. VRM may not be flown during the Low profile regardless of ceiling changes. If a VRM is flown, the demonstration pilot adheres to the  apex  and  90-degree  nose-low  parameters  listed  in  Table  5.10  and  the  procedures  for  a VRM as described in paragraph 5.9.3.1. Once recovery above the minimum altitude for the follow-on  maneuver  is  assured,  backpressure  is  relaxed  and  power  modulated  to  smoothly transition to level flight at the entry altitude for the next maneuver. 5.19.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  the  airspeed  falls  below  the  minimum  of  150  knots,  a nose-high  recovery  should  be  accomplished.  If  the  airspeed  exceeds  350  KIAS  during  any portion of a follow-on VRM or if the aircraft is  below 3,000 feet  AGL at  90 degrees nose-low, immediately initiate a dive recovery to the nearest horizon. 5.20.

Maneuver Description:  Enter the 1,500’ show line at 500 feet AGL and 425 knots. At 4,000 feet prior to show center, raise the nose to five to seven degrees, establish a climb, and apply stick pressure to  roll 90 degrees toward the crowd.  Hold this attitude until  4,000 feet  past show center. Use top  rudder to  hold the nose above the horizon and forward stick pressure to keep the aircraft on the show line. To complete the maneuver, unload, roll wings-level, and perform a repositioning maneuver. 5.20.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  If the minimum entry parameters are not met transition to a wings-level flat pass.  If it becomes apparent the aircraft may descend below 400 feet AGL, roll out of the bank and clear the show line.     NOTE:  The Knife Edge Pass may be used as a  repositioning  maneuver  for  the  purpose  of  orienting  the  subsequent  demonstration maneuver in  the approved direction relative to  the crowd line.      NOTE:  The Knife Edge Pass is a profile transition point if required by changing weather conditions. 5.21.  Maximum Performance Climb with Rolls. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 125 Figure 5.15.

Maneuver  Description:  Enter  on  the  1,500’  show  line  with  a  minimum  of  330 knots at 300 feet AGL approaching show center 135 degrees to the crowd line, but with the flight  path  not  directed  toward  the  crowd.  At  3,000  feet  prior  to  show  center  select  full afterburner  and  initiate  a  6.5  to  7.5-G  wings-level  pull  to  arrive  at  show  center  with  90 degrees of pitch. The pull should be made so the aircraft is vertical at show center. When the aircraft is vertical, perform high-rate unloaded aileron rolls until reaching a minimum of 250 knots or 2,500 feet below wavered airspace. Take every precaution to avoid slow airspeed in an  exaggerated  pitch  attitude  due  to  the  potential  of  “pitch  hang-up”.  Stop  the  aileron  rolls and execute a vertical recovery by smoothly pulling the nose to the nearest horizon to prevent exceeding  waivered  airspace.  Modulate  power  and  speed  brakes  as  required  while performing the descending portion of a repositioning maneuver to enter the show line for the next maneuver. 5.21.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  If the minimum entry parameters are not met transition to a wings-level, flat pass. If roll-coupling occurs during the climb (to exceed approximately 2.5 G),  smoothly  stop  the  roll,  then  pull  to  the  nearest  horizon,  and  roll  upright.  Initiate  an immediate  recovery  to  the  nearest  horizon  if  airspeed  decays  to  250  KIAS  minimum  or altitude reaches 2,500 feet below the top of waivered airspace. 5.22.

Maneuver  Description:  As  the  aircraft  nose  is  brought  through  the  horizon, reacquire the air show environment and perform the spiraling descent oriented toward show center.  In idle power, allow the nose to fall to 45 degrees nose-low.  Once established, apply back-stick  pressure  and  roll  simultaneously  to  maintain  at  least  200  knots  initially  in  a spiraling  dive,  ensuring  airspeed  of  250-440  knots  prior  to  initiating  the  recovery.    At approximately 5,000’ AGL, adjust dive angle and roll in order to be wings-level, less than 45 degrees nose-low at the planned altitude of 4,000’.  The maneuver is complete when the dive angle  is  less  than  45  degrees.      Continue  a  descent  as  required  to  reposition  for  the  next maneuver, however do not perform or exit the maneuver over the crowd.  Do not exceed 440 knots  in  the  descent.    The  airspeed  window  of  250-440  knots  at  maneuver  exit  allows  the pilot  the  flexibility  to  show  the  F-16’s  maneuvering  ability  early  in  the  maneuver  while gaining energy at or below corner velocity to set up for the next maneuver—the Dedication Pass. 5.22.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  below  8,000’  AGL  at  the  apex  of  the  climb  (airspace restrictions,  weather  conditions),  adjust  dive  angle  to  safely  execute  a  recovery  at  4,000’ AGL.    Initiate  an  immediate  dive  recovery  if  airspeed  exceeds  440  knots.    Show  center orientation is a secondary consideration in the spiral descent; do not continue the maneuver below minimum altitude to attempt a specific orientation in the air show environment.  If at any  time  during  the  maneuver  it  appears  that  the  aircraft  may  not  attain  the  prescribed altitude/airspeed  parameters,  abort  the  maneuver.    Roll  out  and/or  pull  to  a  wings-level position,  initiate  a  descent  and  reposition  the  aircraft  for  follow-on  maneuvering.    Option:  Due to changing weather conditions, the vertical spiraling descent may not be possible after the  Max  Performance  Climb.    Start  a  descent  when  able  to  maintain  VMC  conditions  to position the aircraft for the next maneuver. 5.23.  Dedication  Pass.  The  intent  of  this  maneuver  is  to  pay  tribute  to  our  war  fighters.  It  is flown prior to the Tactical Pitch-Up to Land during the High and Low Show profiles. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 129 Figure 5.17.  F-16 Dedication Pass.  Table 5.14.

Maneuver  Description:  The  maneuver  is  flown  beyond  the  500-foot  line. Following the Max Performance Climb with Rolls (high show), or Knife Edge (low show), 130 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 attain a safe airspeed and reposition the aircraft to arrive behind and offset from the crowd. Fly  the  approach  from  behind  the  line,  approximately  2  miles  from  show  center,  with  an approximate 30 degree dive angle and a 45 degree cut (bank angle 75 to 90 degrees) to the show  line,  remaining  beyond  500  feet  from  the  crowd  at  all  times.    Upon  reaching  a  point 500 feet from the corner of the crowd and 300 feet AGL, roll the aircraft into a level arcing pass using bank angles of 75 to 90 degrees. Use top rudder if necessary to maintain altitude. Select max power until passing the show line or until a target airspeed of .85M is anticipated. Use varying pressure altitudes and temperatures to determine when to deselect afterburner to ensure  the  target  airspeed  is  attained  at  show  center  and  the  max  airspeed  is  not  exceeded. Optimum profile of the aircraft is achieved at approximately 80 degrees of bank. Use caution not to over bank the aircraft and allow the aircraft to lose altitude while banking. In order to maintain  500  feet  from  the  crowd  at  each  corner,  ensure  the  flight  path  at  show  center extends beyond 500 feet. Continue the arc beyond the opposite crowd corner, reduce power as  required,  roll  out  of  bank,  and  continue  a  maximum  45-degree  climb  to  set  up  for  the Tactical Pitch-up to Landing. 5.23.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  Abort the maneuver if at any time the aircraft comes closer than 500’ to the crowd line or its lateral limits, an excessive dive angle or sink rate develops, entry  parameters  are  not  met,  or  the  aircraft  descends  below  200  feet  AGL.  Abort  the maneuver by rolling the aircraft wings-level and flying away from the crowd. 5.24.  Tactical Pitch-Up to Landing (Direction of Landing). AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 131 Figure 5.18.

Maneuver  Description:  Do  not  attempt  takeoff  when  the  takeoff  roll  exceeds  80 percent of available runway length. If airfield conditions permit, a brake release point should be  selected  so  takeoff  occurs  at  show  center.  The  show-center  takeoff  point  is  a  secondary consideration  to  determining  critical  field  length,  abort  criteria,  etc.  In  no  case  initiate  the takeoff  with  less  than  6,000  feet  of  runway  remaining.  The  takeoff  is  made  in  full afterburner.  Ensure  a  positive  rate  of  climb  is  established  after  takeoff.  Once  the  gear  is retracted, a three to five-degree nose-high climb is made while accelerating to 400 knots. At this  point,  maintain  afterburner  and  begin  an  energy  sustaining  pitch-up  to  500  feet  AGL, using  5.0  to  7.0  Gs,  and  turn  away  from  the  crowd.  After  225  degrees  of  turn,  unload  and reverse the direction of turn and perform a second level turn in the opposite direction. After 270 degrees with a 45-degree cut to the show line, the turn is again reversed. Vary the bank angle and pitch to arrive at level flight at the completion of the maneuver and to ensure the maneuver is finished above the entry altitude. Complete the maneuver by turning to finish on the show line heading in the same direction as takeoff. Ensure surface winds are taken into consideration in order to center this maneuver on show center and to avoid overshooting the show line. Once on the show line, execute a repositioning maneuver to  prepare for either a Flat Pass (left to right takeoff) or the Triple Aileron Roll (right to left takeoff). 5.26.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If during any portion of the maneuver it becomes apparent the aircraft may descend below 400 feet AGL or airspeed decays below 250 knots, abort the maneuver by rolling wings-level, climbing to 500 feet AGL, and clearing the show line. Use power and G as required (no lower than 250 knots) to prevent the aircraft from overshooting the show line. 5.27.  Flat Pass (Right to Left).  If the direction of takeoff is left to right, use the repositioning maneuver following the Level or Cuban 8 to prepare for a flat pass as described in  paragraph 5.11.1.  At 2,000 feet past show center, execute a repositioning maneuver to set up for the next maneuver. 5.28.  Triple  Aileron  Roll  (Left  to  right).  Perform  the  triple  aileron  roll  as  described  in paragraph  5.12.1.  When  wings-level  following  the  last  aileron  roll,  the  pilot  performs  a repositioning maneuver to set up for the next maneuver. 5.29.  High-G  Turn  (Right  to  Left).  Perform  the  high-G  turn  as  described  in  paragraph 5.13.1.  At 2,000 feet past show center, perform a repositioning maneuver to set up for the next maneuver. 5.30.  Four-Point  Roll  (Left  to  Right).  The  four-point  roll  is  performed  as  described  in paragraph 5.14.1. At the completion of the pass, execute a repositioning maneuver to set up for the next maneuver. 5.31.  High  Speed  Pass.  Perform  the  High  Speed  Flat  Pass  as  in  paragraph  5.20.1.  At  the completion of the pass, execute a reposition maneuver to set up for the next maneuver. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 135 5.32.  Falcon  Turn (Left to  Right).  The Falcon Turn is performed as described in paragraph 5.16.1. At the completion of the maneuver, pull up to a downwind to prepare for the High Alpha pass  against  the  wind.  If  the  wind  favors  a  right  to  left  final,  a  normal  180-degree  pitch-up  to downwind is performed.    NOTE:  The Falcon Turn is a profile transition point if the weather ceiling has changed. 5.33.  High  Alpha  Pass  (Into  the  wind).  This  maneuver  may  be  flown  on  the  500-foot  show line.  The  High  Alpha  pass  is  performed  as  described  in  paragraph  5.18.1.  At  3,000  feet  past show center, perform a repositioning maneuver to set up for the next maneuver. 5.34.  Muscle  Climb.  Perform  the  Muscle  Climb  as  described  in  paragraph  5.19.1.  At  the completion of the pass, execute a reposition maneuver to set up for the next maneuver. 5.35.  Knife  Edge  Pass.  Perform  the  Knife  Edge  Pass  as  in  paragraph  5.20.1.  At  the completion of the pass, execute a reposition maneuver to set up for the next maneuver. 5.36.  Dedication Pass.  Perform the Dedication pass as described in paragraph  5.23.1 5.37.  Tactical Pitch-Up to Landing.  The tactical pitch-up to landing is performed as described in paragraph  5.24.1 5.38.  Staged Show Sites. Figure 5.20.  F-16 Staged Show Sites. 5.38.1.  When  demonstration  aircraft  takeoff  from  other  than  the  show  site,  plan  to  arrive over  the  show  site  with  the  fuel  requirements  prescribed  in  paragraph    5.2  plus  enroute return  fuel  IAW  AFI  11-2F-16  Vol  3.  The  pilot  may  enter  from  behind  the  crowd  at  a minimum of 1,000 ft AGL as depicted in Figure 5.20, or via a Flat Pass maneuver down the show  line,  and  complete  the  show  as  described  in  this  chapter.  Upon  completion  of  the  136 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 Dedication Pass and clearing the crowd, turn out behind the crowd and return to the staging airport.  Pilots  should  plan  to  fly  a  full  demonstration,  but  may  cut  the  profile  short  as required to maintain suitable enroute return fuel. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 137 Chapter 6 F-22 DEMONSTRATION MANEUVERS Section 6A—--General Information 6.1.  General.  Maneuvers  described  in  this  document  are  used  for  training  and  flown  in  F-22 aerial demonstrations as the complete aerobatic demonstration profile. Aerobatic maneuvers are included  in  this  grouping,  and  as  such  treat  this  profile  as  a  standard  Single  Ship  Tactical Demonstration  profile.    The  profile  passes  are  listed  in  a  specific  order  and  described  in  a specific  orientation  to  the  crowd.    Abnormal  procedures  are  written  for  each  maneuver.    If  the entry  conditions  are  not  met  for  any  maneuver,  the  pilot  recovers  to  wings-level  flight  and transitions to the next maneuver.  Certain maneuvers require the pilot to transmit airspeed and/or altitude to a safety observer. The ground safety observer confirms parameters are good, monitors the demonstration pilot’s flight path, engine performance, and visually clears the demonstration area  for  traffic.  The  safety  observer  directs  an  abort  when  parameter  limits  are  exceeded.  Following each maneuver, and before clearing the show line to reposition for the next maneuver, the pilot ensures any descent has been stopped and the aircraft is in a level or climbing attitude with the flight path marker at or above the horizon. 6.2.  Aircraft  Configuration  and  Fuel  Requirements.  These  maneuvers  are  flown  in  a standard  configured  aircraft  with  a  full  fuel  load  of  18,000  pounds  at  engine  start.    If  mission needs dictate, taking off with less than full fuel is authorized. Under all circumstances, ensure the pilot takes off with enough fuel to execute the profile and divert if necessary. Inert weapons may be loaded; however, if the total weight exceeds 1,000 pounds, ensure the total fuel at takeoff is less than 17,000 pounds. 6.3.  Airspeed and G Limits.  Demonstration pilots may not exceed 0.94 Mach.  The maximum target G for this demonstration is 7.5 Gs.  This does not preclude a momentary increase in G for safety considerations. 6.4.  Show line Restrictions.  The majority of the F-22 demonstration is flown on the 1,500-foot show  line.    Maneuvers  not  conforming  to  FAA  Order  8900.1,  Volume  3,  Chapter  6,  require approval via the FAA AFS-800 Maneuver Package approval process. 6.5.  Airspace  and  Runway  Requirements.  Required airspace for the F-22 is 6,000 feet AGL and normally a five-mile radius from show center horizontally.  The minimum dimensions of the aerobatic box are 3,000 feet wide, 4,500 feet long, and 7,000 feet AGL.  If the FAA has waived a show line to closer than 1,500 feet, the aerobatic box may be less than 3,000 feet wide, provided there  is  at  least  1,200  feet  from  either  the  primary  or  secondary  show  line.    Minimum  runway length  and  width  is  7,000  feet  x  75  feet.    Ensure  the  runway,  taxiway,  and  parking  area  are stressed for a 65,000-pound aircraft with single wheel type landing gear. 6.6.  Weather Requirements.  Weather PARAMETER LIMITS for the high show profile are a ceiling  of  at  least  4,500  feet  AGL,  three  miles  ground  and  five  miles  in-flight  visibility  with  a discernible horizon.  Ceiling required for the low profile is 1,500 feet. The ceiling requirements for each maneuver are based on waived airspace (clear of clouds) and require adjustment if using VFR rules. Plan maneuvers to maintain VMC throughout the show sequence. 138 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 6.7.  High  Density  Altitude  Demonstrations.  For  high  density  altitude  shows,  adjust PARAMETER LIMITS in accordance with the following: 6.7.1.  Add 500 feet to APEX altitudes for each 2,000 feet of altitude above 3,000 feet MSL and 10 knots to entry airspeeds on all maneuvers that exceed 30 degrees AOA.  For example, if the show site altitude is 5,000 feet MSL, add 500 feet to the baseline target and 10 knots to the airspeed.  If the show site altitude is 7,000 feet MSL, add 1,000 feet to the baseline target and 20 knots to the airspeed. 6.8.  Demonstration Maneuver Profiles. 6.8.1.  High Show 6.8.1.1.

Reposition  maneuvers  may  be  flown  in  either  direction  at  any time during the demonstration sequence as required.  IAW FAA regulations, 90 degrees of bank may  be  exceeded  during  repositions  (if  required).    Repositioning  turns  may  not  include  added aileron rolls or other accenting maneuvers. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 139 6.9.1.  Flat  Wifferdill  Reposition  Maneuver.    The  Flat  Wifferdill  Maneuver  turn  is  a combination horizontal and shallow vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the show  line  when  performing  the  low  profile.    The  Flat  Wifferdill  Maneuver  turn  uses  less altitude  than  a  normal Wifferdill.    It  requires  a  larger  cut  and  tends  to  be  looser  and  flatter than  a  normal  Wifferdill.    270-degree  turn  reversal  may  be  made  while  the  aircraft  is climbing.  The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs.  Each turn may differ slightly so that airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the flat Wifferdill.  The  entry  "cut"  turn  for  the  flat  Wifferdill  is  made  to  ensure  no  show  line  or  crowd  line penetration. Figure 6.1.  F-22 Flat Wifferdill Reposition. 6.9.2.  Wifferdill  Reposition  Maneuver.  The  Wifferdill  turn  is  a  combination  horizontal and vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the show line.  The vertical plane is used  to  maintain  necessary  proximity  to  the  demonstration  area.    Each  turn  may  differ slightly  so  that  airspeed/altitude  parameters  for  the  next  maneuver  are  established  in  the Wifferdill.    As  the  aircraft  departs  the  show  line,  maneuver  in  the  horizontal  and  vertical plane to reposition for the next maneuver.  The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs.  A 270-degree turn reversal is made while still climbing.  During the last half of the Wifferdill, while descending, the turn is adjusted to establish the proper show line entry.  The entry "cut" turn for the Wifferdill is made to ensure no show line or crowd line penetration.  140 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 Figure 6.2.  F-22 Wifferdill Reposition.  6.9.3.  J-Turn  Reposition  Maneuver.  The  J-Turn  reposition  maneuver  can  be  used  to quickly change directions at each end of the show line while minimizing separation from the crowd  and  further  displaying  the  slow-speed  maneuverability  of  the  Raptor.    From  desired position with  100 KCAS minimum,  aggressively  apply  aft stick while wings-level  to  climb and slow the aircraft while increasing the alpha.  At 36 degrees AOA or more, use stick and rudder to maneuver in the direction of the runway.  Do not maintain high alpha more than is necessary to maneuver the aircraft and do not slow the aircraft to below 75 KCAS if below 2,500  feet  AGL  and  greater  than  75  degrees  nose-high.    Once  the  nose  slices  back  to  the horizon and is pointed towards the crowd line, break the alpha to 36 degrees for the recovery and maintain alpha until sink rate is arrested and begin to set up for the next pass.  Regardless of  nose  position,  recover  from  high  AOA  and  fly  the  aircraft  out  not  later  than  2,500  feet AGL. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 141 Figure 6.3.  F-22 J-Turn Reposition.

Maneuver Description:  Select full AB at brake release and check engine conditions on the roll.  Rotate at  tech order speed  and begin climb.   Confirm  gear is retracted and the light is extinguished in the gear handle.  Accelerate in full AB with a positive climb rate until approaching  show  center  and  on  the  1,500’  show  line.    At  250  KCAS  begin  an  aggressive pull  (soft  to  hard  stop  initially)  up  to  75  degrees  nose-high.    Hold  75  degrees  nose-high (water mark) and allow airspeed to slow, AOA to decrease and altitude to increase.  Passing 3,000  feet  AGL,  smoothly  bring  the  nose  to  90  degrees  nose-high  and  wait  for  3,500  feet AGL.    At  3,500  feet  AGL,  execute  a  full  aft  stick  high  AOA  loop  to  bring  the  nose  to  90 degrees nose-low.  Hold 90 degrees nose-low and accelerate.  At 100 KCAS, execute a 405-degree roll to set the lift vector on a 45-degree reposition line.  If 100 KCAS is not obtained prior to 2,800 feet AGL, do not execute the 405-degree roll, but rather a 45-degree roll to set the reposition line and begin recovery within parameters.  Regardless of orientation, execute a 36-degree AOA recovery NLT 2,000 feet AGL and reposition for the next maneuver. 6.10.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If  the  show  profile  takeoff  is  interrupted  by  an  aircraft malfunction,  make  a  normal  takeoff  or  if  conditions  warrant,  abort  the  takeoff.    If  an afterburner does not light or they are producing thrust asymmetrically do not initiate the pull up.  If  an  afterburner  blows  out  prior  to  initiating  the  pull,  immediately  abort  the  maneuver and execute a nose-high recovery.  Should an engine or afterburner fail, immediately reduce both  throttles to  MIL  or  below  and  recover  the  aircraft.    Do  not  reselect  AB  until  any  yaw rate  is  arrested  and  airspeed  is  >100  KCAS.    If  the  aircraft  slows  to  75  KCAS  prior  to reaching  2,500  feet  AGL,  do  not  execute  the  high  AOA  loop  and  execute  a  nose-high recovery to wings-level.  Should the takeoff need to be executed from right to left for winds or  runway  length,  execute  a  225-degree  roll  to  set  the  reposition  line.    Regardless  of  the starting axis, the reposition line needs to be set and the recovery initiated by 2,000 feet AGL. 6.11.  Minimum Radius Turn 144 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 Figure 6.5.

Maneuver  Description:  Prior to  show center, select  full AB  and accelerate to  440 KCAS.  Beyond the 500' show line and at show center, turn away from the crowd using 75 to 85  degrees  of  bank.    Begin  the  turn  with  an  aggressive  G  onset-rate  to  7.5  Gs  to  avoid accelerating  and  begin  bleeding  airspeed.  G-loading  and  airspeed  bleed-off  rate  vary  with density  altitude.    The  first  180  degrees  of  turn  should  be  accomplished  with  a  1  ¾  degree nose-up attitude and the last 180 degrees of turn should be accomplished with a 1 ¾ degree nose-down attitude to make the turn appear level to the crowd.  After the first 180 degrees of turn, continue to bleed airspeed down to 250 KCAS.  Vary the bank angle, pitch, and pull to arrive at level flight, 275 KCAS, and no closer than 1,500 foot show line at the completion of 360 degrees of turn.  Maximum degrees of flight  path  marker negative pitch allowed while correcting  for  altitude  is  5  degrees.    Ensure  surface  winds  are  taken  into  consideration  in order  to  center  this  maneuver  on  show  center  and  to  avoid  overshooting  the  show  line.  As you  approach  show  center,  smoothly  roll  out  and  aggressively  pull  the  nose  to  90  degrees nose-high.    90  degrees  nose-high  may  be  exceeded  (up  to  110  degrees)  as  long  as  the airspeed  minimum  is  maintained.    As  soon  as  the  aircraft  reaches  150  KCAS,  begin  a  full forward push to drive the nose back down to the horizon and set up for the J-Turn reposition. 6.11.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If the minimum entry parameters are not met, transition to a  wings-level  flat  pass.    If  during  any  portion  of  the  maneuver  it  becomes  apparent  the aircraft  may  descend  below  400  feet  AGL  or  airspeed  decays  below  200  KCAS,  abort  the maneuver  by  rolling  wings-level  and  climbing  to  500  feet  AGL.  If  the  aircraft  approaches 475  KCAS  and  the  pilot  is  already  at  9  Gs,  reduce  power  to  not  less  than  minimum afterburner  and bleed energy.   If necessary, adjust  power and G as  required (no lower than 200  KCAS)  to  avoid  overshooting  the  1,500’  show  line.    In  the  pull  after  the  roll-out,  if airspeed reaches 150 KCAS prior to achieving 90 degrees nose-high begin the push forward early.    Do  not  attempt  the  J-turn  reposition  if  the  aircraft  does  not  exceed  2,500  feet  AGL during the turn. 6.12.  Weapon Bay Door Pass. 146 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 Figure 6.6.

Approaching  the  500’  show  line,  bank  away  from  the  crowd (not to exceed 75 degrees), open all doors and begin a gentle turn to maintain bank, airspeed and  altitude.    Passing  show  center,  close  all  doors,  add  power,  and  fly  to  the  1,500’  show line. Begin  a  climb  to  500 feet  AGL  and select  MAX AB.   Once  above  500 feet  AGL  and 250 KCAS,  execute a 300-degree roll to  set  your lift vector (LV) on the reposition line for the Dedication Pass. 6.12.2.

The approach is flown from behind the line, approximately 2 miles from show center with an approximate dive angle of 30 degrees and a maximum of 45-degree cut from the show line (as  to  not  exceed  90  degrees  of  bank  in  the  turn).    Maintain  beyond  500  feet  horizontally from the crowd at all times.  Upon reaching a point 500 feet from the corner of the crowd at 300’ AGL, roll the aircraft into a level arcing pass using 75 to 90 degrees of bank. Select full AB  until  passing  the  show  line  or  until  .92M  is  anticipated.  In  order  to  maintain  500  feet separation  from  the  crowd  at  both  corners,  ensure  the  apex  of  the  arc  is  greater  than  500’ from show center (the amount depends on the degrees offset from the show line at the start of the arc and the amount  of G used in  the turn).  Continue the arc until  reaching the opposite crowd corner, roll out, reduce power and initiate a climb. 6.13.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  Abort the maneuver if at any time: the aircraft comes closer than 500’ to the crowd line or its lateral limits, an excessive dive angle or sink rate develops, entry parameters are not met, or the aircraft descends below 200 feet AGL.  Abort procedures are to roll wings-level, climb and fly away from the crowd. 6.14.  Pedal Turn. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 149 Figure 6.8.  F-22 Pedal Turn. Table 6.5.  F-22 Pedal Turn Parameters.

Maneuver  Description:  Following  the  Dedication  Pass  reposition,  align  on  the 1,500-foot crowd line at 300 feet AGL and 300 KCAS.  Approaching show center, select full AB, ensure both are lit symmetrically and begin an aggressive (soft to hard stop) pull to 90 degrees nose-high.  When established 90 degrees nose-high with AOA less than 10 degrees, execute  a  360-degree  roll.    Climb  and  decelerate  to  arrive  at  4,000  feet  AGL  with  no  less than 75 KCAS.  Execute a maximum (hard stop) wings-level pull to pull the nose through the inverted  around  to  the  horizon  (high  alpha  loop).    As  the  nose  approaches  the  horizon upright, apply full pedal in the best direction for winds and maintain full-aft stick.  Continue the  turn  for  360  degrees  or  until  lined  up  on  the  1,500-foot  crowd  line  and  begin  an aggressive  push  forward  to  break  the  alpha  and  accelerate.    Catch  36  alpha  in  full  AB  and arrest the descent rate.  Should winds, weather or other factors dictate, the pedal turn may be executed  as  two  180-degree  turns.    Pre-brief  this  sequence  of  two  180-degree  turns  and  do not  execute  from  an  airborne  “on  the  fly”  assessment.      If  the  180/180  pedal  turn  is  the desired maneuver, add 1,000 feet to the apex pull, making the minimum pull 5,000 feet AGL. Execute two 360-degree rolls due to the additional altitude required. 6.14.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  If an afterburner does not light, do not initiate the entry pull up.  If  an  afterburner  blows  out  prior  to  initiating  the  apex  pull,  immediately  abort  the maneuver and execute a nose-high recovery. If the aircraft airspeed decreases to less than75 KCAS prior to reaching 4,000 feet AGL, initiate the pull early and assess altitude parameters to  execute the pedal  turn.  If 2,500 feet  AGL is  reached prior to  completing the pedal  turn, recover early.  No matter the orientation of the aircraft, initiate recovery at 2,500 feet AGL and fly a 36-degree AOA recovery to arrest sink rate.  Should an engine or afterburner fail, immediately reduce both throttles to MIL or below and recover the aircraft. Do not reselect AB until yaw rate is arrested and airspeed is greater than 100 KCAS. 6.15.  Power Loop. AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 151 Figure 6.9.  F-22 Power Loop. Table 6.6.

Abeam show center, execute a maximum wings-level pull to bring the nose of the aircraft into the vertical.  Continue a maximum pull all the way around until the nose of the aircraft is upright and at the starting horizon.  Command forward-stick to decrease alpha and accelerate.  Catch 36 degrees alpha and maintain until sink rate is arrested. 6.15.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If afterburners are not symmetrically lit, do not initiate the pull up. Smoothly pull to the nearest horizon and recover the aircraft.  Should an engine fail or an afterburner blow out, ensure throttles are in MIL or below and recover the aircraft.  Do not reselect AB until any yaw rate is arrested and airspeed is >100 KCAS. 6.16.  Loaded Roll Figure 6.10.  F-22 loaded Roll. Table 6.7.  F-22 Loaded Roll Parameters.

Maneuver  Description:  Following  recovery  from  the  Power  Loop,  on  the  1,500’ show  line,  at  1,400  feet  AGL  (higher  if  aircraft  is  recovered  earlier)  and  36  degrees  AOA, apply  full  lateral  stick  and  approximately  half  pedal  deflection  with  the  flight  path  marker above the horizon.  Maintain 30-36 degrees AOA initially, then remove pedal deflection and reduce  back-stick  pressure  to  maintain  20-28  degrees  AOA  while  the  LV  is  below  the horizon.    Once  the  LV  is  above  the  horizon,  complete  the  roll  by  increasing  back-stick pressure  and  AOA  to  30-36  degrees.    When  the  aircraft  reaches  upright  wings-level  to  the horizon, decrease angle of attack, accelerate and begin to reposition for the next maneuver. 6.16.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If both afterburners do not light, do not exceed 30 degrees angle  of  attack  and  recover  the  aircraft.      If  the  aircraft  descends  below  1,200  feet  AGL, immediately initiate a recovery by rolling wings-level (with decreased AOA) and pulling to the  nearest  horizon.    If  the  aircraft  ever  exceeds  40  degrees  nose-low  or  an  excessive  sink rate develops, recover.  If airspeed is allowed to decay to less than 100 KCAS, terminate the maneuver and recover. 6.17.  Tail Slide. 154 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 Figure 6.11.  F-22 Tail Slide. Table 6.8.

Maneuver  Description:  After  the  Loaded  Roll,  reposition  behind  the  crowd, perpendicular  to  the  show  line  and  directly  behind  show  center.    Fly  over  show  center  at 1,000 feet AGL and 250 KCAS.  Select MIL power over show center and at the 1,500-foot show line, execute a hard stop pull in MIL power to 80 degrees nose-high.  Hold 80 degrees nose-high with back stick pressure and attempt to align the waterline and CDM as the aircraft slows.   Modulate power to  arrive at  3,000 feet  AGL and 0 KCAS.   Smoothly reselect  MIL power  and  allow  the  aircraft  to  slide  backwards  while  holding  80  degrees  nose-high.    At 2,700  feet  AGL  or  75  KCAS  backwards  (whichever  occurs  first),  push  forward  of  the  soft stop  to  assist  the  FLCS  in  bringing  the  nose  down  and  reducing  AOA.    Recover  in  MIL power to wings-level flight.  Begin a turning reposition for the Slow Speed Pass.   Entry to the  tail  slide  may  be  flown  from  show  left  or  right  if  dictated  by  crowd  or  show  line restrictions  (e.g.  foreign  tradeshows).    This  type  of  entry  is  flown  with  same  entry  altitude and  airspeed  parameters;  however,  the  entry  is  initiated  by  a  climbing  turn  away  from  the crowd  approximately  1,000’  prior  to  show  center  to  achieve  the  same  tail  slide  parameters and position in the aerobatic box as the standard reposition over the crowd. Ensure this entry is flown and documented in practice prior to accomplishing in a public performance. 6.17.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  If sideslip (beta in the HUD) rapidly increases through 20 degrees  or  is  observed  greater  than  30  degrees,  initiate  a  recovery  by  pushing  forward slightly less than the soft stop.  If the tail slide begins prior to 2,800 feet AGL, immediately initiate a recovery. 6.18.  F-22 Slow Speed Pass. 156 AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 Figure 6.12.  F-22 Slow Speed Pass. Table 6.9.

If wind is negligible or predominantly a crosswind, set  the  pass  to  be  the  same  direction  as  the  takeoff.    Maintain  120  KCAS  in  the  reposition AFI11-246V1  19 JULY 2016 157 turn and fly to a point ~3,000’ from the start of the crowd line.  Target the line 90 degrees off pass heading at 1,000 feet AGL and 150 KCAS in MIL power.  Execute a soft stop pull to align the jet on the desired heading and catch 36 degrees angle of attack.  Do not exceed 40 degrees  angle  of  attack.    Manipulate  power  and  pitch  to  maintain  1,000  feet  AGL  and  36 degrees angle of attack on show line heading.  After passing the crowd on the opposite side, select full afterburner and climb to 4,000 feet  AGL to set up for the Split-S. During a Low Show, the reposition may be flown no less than 500 feet AGL.   In all cases, the aircraft may not  be  flown  less  than  120  KCAS  greater  than  30  degrees  AOA  when  less  than  900  feet AGL. 6.18.2.  Abnormal Procedures:  If 40 degrees angle of attack is exceeded, immediately add power and push forward to catch and sustain 36 degrees.  If the aircraft descends below 900 feet AGL terminate the maneuver and recover the aircraft.  Do NOT select afterburner with less than 75 KCAS and greater than 36 degrees AOA.  If the aircraft slows below 75 KCAS, add  power  (up  to  MIL)  and  decrease  angle  of  attack.    If  an  engine  fails,  IMMEDIATELY reduce power to mid-range on both throttles and begin a soft stop push to reduce AOA and gain airspeed.  Do not push the nose greater than 10 degrees nose-low.  Use lateral stick and pedal  as  required  to  maintain  wings-level  controllable  flight.    Accelerating  through  100 KCAS,  smoothly  bring  both  throttles  to  MIL  and  full  afterburner  passing  125  KCAS.  Recovery may be limited to 20 degrees AOA. 6.19.

Maneuver Description:  In the climb after the Slow Speed pass move to the 1,500’ show  line,  maintain  45-50  degrees  nose-high  and  allow  the  aircraft  to  accelerate.    Tailor degrees nose-high to not only accelerate but also gain separation away from the crowd for the follow-on High Speed Pass.  If the nose is held too nose-high there may not be enough room to accelerate after the maneuver.  At 4,000 feet  AGL roll inverted and crosscheck airspeed.  With 150 KCAS (minimum) execute an energy gaining turn to proceed back towards show center.  Do not exceed 350 KCAS until the nose is through 90 degrees nose-low.  Orientation to  the  crowd  line  needs  to  be  immediately  assessed.    If  the  aircraft  is  not  on  the  extended show line, make immediate corrections.  Position the aircraft on the non-aerobatic show line at 300 feet AGL and approximately .8M for the high speed pass. 6.19.2.  Abnormal  Procedures:  Initiate  a  parameters  call  to  the  safety  observer  prior  to starting  the  pull.    If  airspeed  is  less  than  150  KCAS  (minimum)  push  the  nose  toward  the horizon and increase airspeed to  greater than 150 KCAS  (minimum).  With  altitude greater than 3,500 feet and airspeed greater than 150 KCAS, execute Split-S.  If altitude is less than 3,500 feet  AGL (i.e. weather) or airspeed is  above 275 KCAS,  abort  the Split-S reposition.  Roll the aircraft away from the crowd, reposition in a horizontal plane and slice back for the next  maneuver.    If  an  aircraft  malfunction  that may  affect  the  aerodynamic  performance  of the  aircraft  asserts  prior  to  reaching  90  degrees  nose-low,  discontinue  the  pull,  roll  wings-level and recover the aircraft. 6.20.
