This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle training and education requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the Airfield Management specialty, IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  The CFETP will provide Airfield Management personnel a clear career path to succeed in all aspects of career field training.  NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training. 2.  This CFETP consists of two parts; supervisors must plan, manage, and control training using both parts of this plan. 2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training, and other); Section D indicates resource constraints (funds, manpower, equipment, facilities, etc.); and Section E identifies transition training requirements. 2.2.  Part II includes the following:  Section A identifies the STS and includes duties, tasks, and training references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course and core task requirements; Section B contains the COL and training standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements; Section C identifies available support materials; Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training, both mandatory and optional courses; and Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  At the unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. 3.  Using guidance provided in this CFETP will ensure individuals in Airfield Management receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career.  This plan enables us to train today's work force to meet future wartime requirements. 5           ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) - An evolving, outcome-focused approach to education, training, and performance aiding that blends standards-based distributed learning models emphasizing reusable content objects, content and learning management systems, performance support systems/devices, web applications services, and connectivity.  ADL is an evolution of distributed learning (distance learning) that emphasizes collaboration on standards-based versions of reusable objects, networks, and learning management systems, yet may include some legacy methods and media.  ADL is structured learning that takes place without requiring the physical presence of an instructor.  Although the Air Force (AF) uses the term advanced distributed learning, some federal agencies and Department of Defense (DoD) components may use the term distance learning.  These terms refer to the same basic concept. Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS) - ADLS is the system that delivers ADL content and tracks and reports student progress. Advanced Training (AT) - Formal course that provides individuals who are qualified in one or more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills/knowledge to enhance expertise in the career field.  Training is for selected career airmen at the advanced level of the AFS.

This CFETP provides information necessary for the AFCFM, MFMs, commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training that individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the AF or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  UGT identifies the mandatory courses and task qualification requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the UGT process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or OJT, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes, which include: 1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct and evaluate a career field’s training program.  It is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career. 1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career. 1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training and the training delivery method. 1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints, which impact full implementation of the desired career field training process. 12               2.  Uses.  This plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in Airfield Management. 2.1.  AETC and Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, qualification and proficiency requirements.  OJT, resident training, continuation training, or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFS must be identified for inclusion in the plan.  The AFCFM must review and approve any MAJCOM JQS. 2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority and will initiate an annual review of this plan to ensure currency and accuracy.  MAJCOM representatives, AETC and AFFSA training personnel will identify and coordinate on career field training requirements.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training. Section B – Air Force Specialty (AFS) Progression and Information 4.  Specialty Descriptions Requirements. 4.1.

Training Decisions. This CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the 1C7X1 career field.  The spectrum includes the strategy of when, where and how to meet these training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a fragmented approach to training.  The training decisions were made during the STRT held 25-29 April 2016 and utilizing the ISD process as implemented by 334th Technical Training Squadron (334 TRS) during training planning and course development.  6.1.  Initial Skills Training.  The initials skills course, E3ABR1C731, has been revised by 334 TRS at Keesler AFB, MS per updates made to Part II of this CFETP. 6.2.  5-Skill Level Upgrade Training.  The training section at AFFSA developed 5-skill level UTG which was implemented in March 2011 to replace outdated Career Development Courses.  Feedback from the field was there is too much duplication with PCGs, which were also targeted for improvement.  Therefore, AFFSA combined the UTG and AMOC PCG to manage both AMOC qualification and 5-skill level UGT and the UTG was discontinued.  Trainees will complete the new AMOC PCG to be awarded the 5-skill level.  The new PCGs will match the updated STS and with 334 TRS assistance, be written to match updated proficiency codes. 6.3.  7-Skill Level Upgrade Training.  Various 7-skill level STS proficiency codes were updated to ensure a building block approach as trainees transition from 5-level and then to 9- level training.  The 334 TRS has revised the Airfield Management Craftsman Course utilizing the milSuite and ADL venues.  This course is conducted in both venues and 18       requires the supervisor (or supervisory chain) to proctor the individual’s tests.  Please review the explanation of milSuite on Page 9 of abbreviation/terms explained. 6.4.  Advanced Airfield Managers Course.  Minor updates were made to the E3AZR1C791, Course Training Standard (CTS).  The adjustments will be included in the similarly improved AFM PCG.  Additional updates will be made to the AFM PCG to better prepare trainees for the Advanced Airfield Manager Course. 6.5.  Retraining Personnel.  Retrainees will attend the 3-skill level resident training course before entering 5-skill level UGT.  Upon award of 5-skill level, retrainees holding the rank of SSgt or above are entered into 7-skill level UGT.  The AFCFM may waive the skill upgrade requirements, with justification, on a case-by-case basis, to the previously held skill level.  Process such waiver requests in accordance with the guidance listed in paragraph 6.5.1. 6.5.1.  AFCFMs are the authority for waiving any mandatory training requirement(s).  Process the waiver request to the AFCFM in the following manner: 6.5.1.1.  Supervisors decide whether pursuing a waiver is appropriate by considering the complexity of the new AFS and the trainee's background.  If a waiver is deemed appropriate, supervisors develop and forward a case file, which includes evidence to warrant a waiver, through the unit commander to the servicing Military Personnel Flight (MPF) personnel employment element.  6.5.1.2.  The MPF will provide their recommendations and forward the case file to the MAJCOM/A1, who will coordinate the package with the MAJCOM training manager and 1C7X1 MFM.  Cases will then be sent to the AFCFM for a decision.  In the event there is no 1C7 functional manager at the MAJCOM to evaluate the case, the MAJCOM training manager will send the case to AFPC for review by the appropriate AFPC functional advisor.  After AFPC review, the case will be sent to the AFCFM. 6.6.  Proficiency Training.  NCOIC, Airfield Management Training (NAMT) will develop and administer practical or written tests at least monthly to maintain a high standard of proficiency. 6.7.  Continuation Training.  Continuation training opportunities are described in Table 6.7. The majority of these courses are unit funded.  Each unit (and MAJCOM) should request funding support for continuation training courses in each annual fiscal year budget.  Additional continuation training courses may be found on the American Associates of Airport Executives (AAAE) or FAA Academy websites. 19                  Table 6.7 - Continuation Training Opportunities Course Description and Source Basic Airport Safety & Operations Specialist School.

The core tasks identify the minimum essential tasks required to perform the duty expected of each person in each skill level of the specialty. 28                             2.3.  Column 3 provides certification for OJT and is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Items identified by © require third party certification.  The trainer will determine when the trainee is ready to be certified on a task.  If no third party certification is required, training is certified complete by the trainer, by initialing the trainer block.  If the task requires third party certification, the training is certified complete after the trainer initials the training block and the task certifier conducts a task evaluation and initials the certifier block.  Use automated training management systems to document, if available. Task certification must show a certification or completion date. 2.4.  Column 4 shows formal training requirements and the proficiency to be demonstrated on-the-job by the graduate as a result of formal training on the task and knowledge. 2.5.  The qualitative requirements at the beginning of Attachment 1 contain the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training. 2.6.  The STS is used to document task completion when placed in AF Form 623, On-The- Job Training Record, and according to AFI 36-2201.  Documentation shall be IAW AFI 36- 2201 or any subsequent messages. 2.6.1.  At the unit level, tasks are trained and qualified to the "Go" level.  "Go" means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures ("Go" level equates to 3c in the STS proficiency code key).  Graduates of the 3-level resident course are trained to the level indicated by the codes in column 4, as they relate to the proficiency code key at the front of the STS, and not to the “Go” level. 2.6.2.  Duty position requirements are identified by circling the subparagraph number next to the task statement on the master training record.  Any additional duty position tasks required by a unit must be added in the 797 tab of AFTR.  As a minimum, complete the following columns in Part 2 of the CFETP; Training Completed, Trainee Initials, Trainer Initials and Certifier Initials (if third party certification is required). 2.6.3.  The AFCFM requires third-party certification and evaluation on selected STS and AF Form 797 items; which means the certifier must be someone other than the trainer.  At ARC locations that do not have enough positions to comply, the applicable ARC MFM is delegated the authority to waive this requirement.  ARC MFM waivers will be location specific and not "blanket".  The STS item will be transcribed, actions taken will be documented on the AF Form 623a and a copy of the waiver placed in the User File in AFTR. 2.7.  Transcribing documentation to a new CFETP is an administrative function, not a re- evaluation of training.  Therefore, supervisor and trainer are considered synonymous for the purpose of documentation.  Transcribe within 120 days (240 days for ARC) of CFETP revision date or from date revision is posted to automated training records systems.  Upon publication of a new CFETP, use the following procedures to transcribe: 29               2.7.1.  Use the new CFETP to identify past and current training requirements and to transcribe qualifications from the previous CFETP. 2.7.2.  For tasks previously qualified/certified and required in the current duty position, enter the current date in the completion column.  Trainee initials in the trainee column and the supervisor/trainer initials in the trainer column. 2.7.3.  Annotate the AF Form 623A, (for example, “I certify the information contained in the CFETP dated XX was transcribed to the CFETP dated XX, and the trainee was given the superseded CFETP.”  Signed and dated by supervisor and trainee). 2.7.4.  For personnel in retraining status, maintain the CFETP from previous AFSC until commensurate skill level is achieved, then give the obsolete field CFETP to the individual. 2.7.5.  Automated training records update automatically when a new CFETP is published.  Supervisors and trainers must review to ensure applicable tasks transferred and identify any new tasks that require training. 2.8.  When a supervisor determines an Airman is unqualified on a task previously certified for their duty position, the supervisor erases the previous certification, or deletes certification when using automated system.  Appropriate remarks pertaining to the reason for decertification are entered on the AF Form 623A or automated version.  Begin recertification following initial certification procedures. 2.9.  The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Specialty Knowledge Tests are developed at the AETC Airman Advancement Division, by Senior Noncommissioned Officers (SNCOs) with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog.  Individual responsibilities are in Chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, AF Military Personnel Testing System.  WAPS is not applicable to the ANG. 3.  Recommendations.  Comments and recommendations are invited concerning the quality of AETC training.  A Customer Service Information Line (CSIL) has been installed for the supervisor convenience.  For a quick response to concerns, call CSIL at DSN 597-4566, or fax at DSN 597-3790, or e-mail 81trg-tget@keesler.af.mil.  Reference this STS and identify the specific area of concern (paragraph, training standard element, etc.). Section B – Course Objective List 4.  Measurement.  Each objective is indicated as follows: P indicates required task performance, which is measured with a performance test.  O indicates trainee must correctly articulate the desired level of knowledge on the subject/task. 5.  Standard.  The standard is 70% on written examinations.  Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress 30   checklist.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. 6.  Proficiency Level.  Most task performance is taught to the 2b proficiency level, which means the student can do most parts of the task but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task. 7.  Course Objectives.  The course objectives are listed in the sequence taught by block of instruction.  A detailed listing of course objectives may be obtained by written request to 334 TRS/TRR, Keesler AFB MS, 39534-2335. Section C – Support Materials 8.
