General  .  This publication provides AF weather personnel and organizations guidance on how  to  accomplish  operations  for  characterization  processes  as  described  in  AFI  15-128  and Army  Regulation  (AR)  115-10/AFI  15-157  Interservice  Publication  (IP),  Weather  Support  and Services for the U.S. Army.  Effective use of the procedures in this manual enhances the quality, timeliness, and relevance of air and space weather information, products, and services.  Weather support  spans  the  full  spectrum  of  strategic,  operational  and  tactical  operations;  given  the dynamic nature of military operations, an organization is routinely supporting more than one AF core function or Army warfighting function at a time.  Therefore, while the volumes of AFMAN 15-129 primarily focus on the weather functions of characterization and exploitation separately, weather personnel use both volumes when accomplishing their mission. 1.1.1.  Characterization.  Characterization and its subordinate processes are defined in AFPD 15-1 and AFI 15-128.  This manual describes how to execute the characterization processes of  collection,  processing,  analysis  and  prediction,  and  dissemination.   Weather characterization  depends  on  the  ability  to  collect  accurate  data,  process  the  data,  correctly analyze the resulting information, and use that information to produce a coherent picture of the present and future state of the air and space environment.  Units may be designated with the primary responsibility for characterization of the air and space environment.  Personnel in these  units  require  the  basic  knowledge  to  understand  how  the  information  they  produce  is exploited  and  may  also  conduct  tasks  within  the  exploitation  processes  (refer  to  AFMAN 15129, Volume 2, Air and Space Weather Operations - Exploitation). 1.1.1.1.  (DELETED) 1.1.2.  Relationship  between  Tailoring  and  Characterization.    As  defined  in  AFPD  151  and AFI 15128, tailoring focuses on mission profiles and the associated operationally significant weather parameters and values.  Tailoring weather information is not a re-characterization of the  air  and  space  environment.    Tailoring  always  begins  with  characterized  data  and information that is already available.  A necessary step in tailoring may be taking strategic or operational  level  products,  and  through  further  characterization,  refining  them  to  the  level and/or specification criteria of the mission. 1.1.2.1.  (DELETED) 1.1.2.2.  (DELETED) 1.1.2.2.1.  (DELETED) 1.1.2.2.2.  (DELETED) 1.2.  Risk Management.  Risk management (RM) is a decision-making process to systematically evaluate possible courses of action, identify risks and benefits, and determine the best course of action for any given situation.  Leadership will apply RM principles and processes to day-to-day weather  operations  to  focus  activities  and  allocate  resources  of  the  weather  unit  to  exploit environmental  conditions,  mitigate  mission  delays,  and  enhance  the  overall  effectiveness  of operations. 6 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 1.2.1.  AFPD  90-8,  Environment,  Safety  &  Occupational  Health  Management  and  Risk Management,  establishes  the  RM  program.    AF  units  implement  AFPD  90-8  with  AFI  90-802,  Risk  Management,  and  use  AF  Pamphlet  (AFPAM)  90-803,  Risk  Management Guidelines and Tools, as a process guide. Figure 1.1.  (DELETED) 1.2.2.  Unit leadership will develop and post a duty priority list. (T-1).  When developing the duty  priority  list,  leadership  includes  the  application  and  techniques  of  the  five-step  RM process  found  in  AFI  90-802  to  be  consistent  with  the  RM  processes  of  operational customers and the unique mission needs of their organization.  Table 1.1 provides a starting point  for  unit  leadership  to  incorporate  RM  in  unit  activities.    As  a  minimum,  weather personnel  must  apply  the  principles  of  RM  while  managing  weather  characterization activities in the following areas in accordance with their posted duty priorities: (T-1). 1.2.2.1.  Meteorological Watch (METWATCH) processes and procedures. 1.2.2.2.  Resource Protection processes and procedures to include Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP). 1.2.2.3.  (DELETED) 1.2.2.4.

(DELETED) AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 7 Chapter 2 CHARACTERIZATION 2.1.  Characterization.  Units  that  characterize  the  air  and  space  environment  must  establish logical  and  repeatable  processes  for  collection,  processing,  analysis  and  prediction,  and dissemination.    These  processes  will  focus  on  uniformity,  production,  and  quality  assurance  of final products according to locally-developed guidance. (T-2). 2.1.1.  (DELETED) 2.2.  Processes  and  Procedures.  Characterization  units  will  employ  logical,  repeatable processes  and  procedures  to  collect,  analyze  and  predict  mission  critical  thresholds  in  the terrestrial  or  space  environment  in  accordance  with  mission  descriptions  and  assigned geographic or functional areas of responsibility.  Characterization unit leadership will: 2.2.1.  Conduct and document, at a minimum, an annual review of processes and procedures (e.g., SOPs, OIs) to ensure accuracy. 2.2.2.  Conduct  and  document,  at  a  minimum,  an  annual  review  of  all  processes  and procedures (e.g., SOPs, OIs) for which they are position qualified. 2.2.3.  Establish  and  document,  at  a  minimum,  a  continuous  improvement  process  for  the following core processes:  collection, analysis and prediction. 2.2.4.  Formally document both quality assurance and forecast review processes. 2.2.5.  Cross-feed best  practices  and lessons learned to  other units that  characterize through the  chain  of  command  to  the  MAJCOM  functional  managers  for  standardization  across  the weather functional community. (T-3). 2.3.  Collection  Process.  Collection  is  the  essential  component  of  worldwide  and  regional databases  from  which  characterization  units  derive  weather  products.    Characterization  units collect  terrestrial  and  space  environmental  information  from  across  the  globe.    A  continual collection of weather and space data contributes to the accuracy of products. 2.4.  Analysis  Process.  Characterization  units  will  develop  a  systematic  analysis  process  to determine  the  current  state  of  the  atmosphere.    Analysis  entails  building  a  coherent,  integrated depiction  of  the  past  and  current  state  of  the  natural  environment  over  a  specified  region.  Characterization units provide effective analysis of collected weather data (terrestrial and space) to  help  ensure  the  accuracy  of  products.    These  data  are  processed  and  assimilated  into environmental  databases  to  provide  battlespace  awareness  and  inputs  for  decision-making  and predictions.  Analysis will drive forecast decision trees throughout the process.  The procedures for  analyzing  data  may  vary  depending  on  the  data  and  parameters,  and  methods  may  include visually inspecting data and producing analysis products. 2.5.  Prediction Process.  This process guides weather forecasters in developing a prediction of the future state of the atmosphere.  Characterization units will include the following items in the forecast processes and procedures: 2.5.1.  Continuity and Persistence. 2.5.2.  Climatology. 8 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 2.5.3.  Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) Models.  NWP output will be evaluated every 3 hours through an objective verification process to identify model deviations from the sensed environment  and  evaluate  the  run-to-run  consistency  of  meteorological  models  to  improve the  forecast  processes.    Model  verification  products  will  be  used,  along  with  subjective techniques such as continuity and extrapolation, as a guide for adjusting forecasts. 2.5.4.  Ensembles.  Characterization units employ Ensemble Prediction Suites (EPS) as a tool to assess credibility of weather data identified by single model forecasts.  Characterization of credible  data  will  enhance  military  decision  making  processes  when  provided  to  units serviced by characterization units for exploitation purposes. 2.5.5.  Forecast  Techniques  and  Rules  of  Thumb  (ROT).    Characterization  units  will document,  evaluate  and  review  biennially,  all  forecast  techniques  and  rules  of  thumb.  Characterization  units  will  integrate  validated  forecast  techniques  and  rules  of  thumb  into forecast processes. 2.5.6.  Forecast  Worksheets/Checklists.    Forecasters  will  utilize  forecast  worksheets  and checklists  in  order  to  work  logically  and  consistently  through  the  forecast  process.    When developing worksheets/checklists/decision aids, characterization units will: 2.5.6.1.  Design  worksheets/checklists  to  help  forecast  specific  terrestrial  or  space weather parameters. 2.5.6.2.  Integrate  location  specific  forecast  reference  material,  forecast  tools  and techniques for different seasons and atmospheric patterns as applicable. 2.5.6.2.1.  Review  forecast  reference  material  seasonally  for  forecast  application updates. 2.5.6.2.2.  Ensure  relevant,  specific,  and  tailored  forecast  reference  material,  as required  in  AFI  15-128,  Air  Force  Roles  and  Responsibilities,  is  included  in qualification  training  and  reviewed  by  training  flight  weather  personnel  on  a  semi-annual basis. 2.5.6.3.  Provide  a  summation  of  forecast  reasoning  employed  for  developing  the forecast. 2.5.6.4.  Document  significant  changes  to  forecast  products  as  a  result  of  collaboration with exploitation units. 2.5.6.5.  Host worksheets on primary and backup OWS sites for continued tier 1 support as required in AFI 15-128. 2.6.  Dissemination. 2.6.1.  The 2d Systems Operations Squadron (2SYOS) at Offutt AFB is the primary agency responsible  for  weather  enterprise  collection  and  dissemination  activities.    2SYOS  operates and  maintains  enterprise  transmission  and  storage  systems  operating  at  multiple  levels  of security classification. 2.6.2.  Characterization units will process meteorological data and prepare weather products using  Air  Force  approved  production  systems.    Air  Force  standard  weather  production systems  will  be  used  to  disseminate  characterization  products,  weather  watches,  warnings, AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 9 advisories,  and  other  products  or  services  via  an  Air  Force  standard  communication  node, web services, and/or subscription services. 2.6.3.  Characterization units will make every effort to make environmental data and products available  for  dissemination  via  systems  and  data  networks  approved  by  combatant  or  joint commands.    These  efforts  will  apply  to  units  participating  in  joint,  coalition,  or  combined operations  within  the  characterization  unit’s  AOR  when  cross-system  and/or  cross-network data transfer is available. 2.7.  Meteorological  Watch  (METWATCH).  This  is  a  deliberate  continuous  process  for monitoring terrestrial weather or the space environment in an area or region.  The purpose of a METWATCH  is  to  identify  when  and  where  observed  conditions  significantly  diverge  from forecast conditions, determine courses of action to update or amend a forecast product or group of products, and notify designated agencies.  Characterization units will: 2.7.1.  Establish  and  maintain  a  prioritized  threat-based  METWATCH  process  for  all locations  for  which  it  is  responsible  for  issuing  products  (i.e.,  warnings,  watches,  and advisories), and employ Risk Management (RM) steps to identify weather threats impacting characterization products and maximize effectiveness of resources. 2.7.2.  Monitor  and  identify  changes  in  weather  conditions  that  cross  critical  weather thresholds,  as  outlined  in  the  installation  data  page  for  the  supported  unit,  and  evaluate forecast products/reasoning when conditions are not occurring as forecast. 2.7.3.  Amend forecast per product amend criteria and coordinate with exploitation units per established procedures. 2.7.4.  Develop METWATCH procedures to include the following: 2.7.4.1.  Identify  primary  METWATCH  data  sources,  document  forecast  methods,  and standardize methods of obtaining weather situational awareness. 2.7.4.2.  Identify  weather  products  and  services  affected  by  unexpected  changes  to forecasted  conditions.    At  a  minimum,  characterization  units  that  have  METWATCH responsibilities  will  have  prioritized  procedures  for  Watches,  Warnings,  and  Advisories (WWAs),  Terminal  Aerodrome  Forecasts  (TAFs),  Military  Operating  Area  Forecasts (MOAFs), and flight hazards. 2.7.4.3.  Outline  the  actions  to  take  when  forecast  conditions  change  during  the METWATCH.    Specify  the  units  to  contact  and  primary  and  backup  contact  methods (e.g., telephone, e-mail, phone patch). 2.8.  Aircraft  Mishaps.  Upon  notification  of  an  aircraft  or  ground  mishap,  the  OWS  will provide pertinent data to the investigating authority by any and all coordinated means or media.  This  data  will  include,  but  is  not  limited  to  observations,  TAFs,  WWA,  hazards  charts, Meteorological  Satellite  (METSAT)  imagery,  and  available  RADAR  data  (including  Velocity Azimuth  Display  (VAD)  wind  profiles).    This  will  include  data  from  the  time  of  the  event through the previous 12 hours for the region of operations, and subsequent 6 hours after event.   10 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 2.9.  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  Nuclear,  High-Yield  Explosive  (CBRNE).  OWSs will: 2.9.1.  Provide products and services specified in the regionally responsible Air Force OWS section  of  Table  A4.38  in  AFI  10-2501  Air  Force  Emergency  Management  Program Planning and Operations. 2.9.2.  Execute  items  5-9  of  WF  section  of  Table  A4.38  in  AFI  10-2501  Air  Force Emergency  Management  Program  Planning  and  Operations  when  the  installation  WF  is absent or unavailable. AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 11 Chapter 3 OWS CHARACTERIZATION PRODUCTS 3.1.  General.  Operational Weather Squadrons (OWSs) are organized, trained, and equipped to conduct weather operations and provide specified weather products and information for AF and Army  operations  within  their  regional  areas  as  defined  in  AF  Visual  Aid  (AFVA)  15-137, Operational Weather Squadron Areas of Responsibility. 3.1.1.  Operational  Production.  OWSs  develop  procedures  to  collect,  analyze  and  predict the  environmental  conditions  (see  Paragraph  2.1).    All  meteorological  symbols,  isopleths, and color representations used in the production of graphical analysis/forecast products must be  compliant  with  World  Meteorological  Organization  (WMO)  and  ICAO  standards  or  the current  Military  Standard  (MIL-STD)  2525,  Joint  Military  Symbology  (see  Attachment  2).  In the event that standards conflict, units will follow MILSTD 2525. (T-0). 3.1.1.1.  (DELETED) 3.1.2.  Characterization  units  will  establish  local  procedures  to  ensure  the  horizontal consistency between all Forecaster-In-The-Loop (FITL) products. 3.1.3.  OWSs  will  maintain  a  looping  capability  of  analysis  products  on  their  homepage extending back 72 hours from the current posted valid time. 3.1.4.  OWSs  may  use  model-generated  products  for  areas  determined  to  be,  and  locally-documented as, low-use areas within their designated region (see Paragraph 3.5.2.4). 3.2.  Analysis Products. 3.2.1.  Surface Analysis. 3.2.1.1.  OWSs  will  produce  and  make  available  to  operational  users,  a  twice-daily synoptic scale analysis of the 0000Z and 1200Z surface data.  OWSs may produce 0600Z and  1800Z  analysis  products.   These  products  will  be  available  via  standard dissemination systems not later than 90 minutes from valid time.  OWSs will use satellite and model data where surface data is too limited to produce a useful surface analysis. 3.2.1.2.  At a minimum, analysis products will contain all parameters listed in Table 3.1. for polar and mid-latitude regions.   12 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 Table 3.1.  Polar/Mid-Latitude Analysis Parameters Polar/Mid-Latitude Parameters -  Plotted surface data -  Isobars, base value 1000 millibars (mb) at 4-mb intervals -  Positions of fronts and troughs -  Locations of closed pressure systems with central values and an appropriate H/L symbol -  Air mass type and source region - Tropical cyclones -  12-hour  continuity  of  front,  troughs,  closed  pressure  systems  and  other  significant  weather                features 3.2.1.3.  Analysis products will contain all parameters listed in Table 3.2 for tropical/sub-tropical regions.  Note: Under certain conditions, meteorological features in sub-tropical latitudes  are  best  depicted  using  mid-latitude  parameters  from  Table  3.1.  OWSs  will determine  when  to  employ  mid-latitude  analysis  techniques  and  analyze  the  charts accordingly. 3.2.1.4.  JTWC  low-level  streamline  tropical  analysis  products  are  the  authoritative product  set  for  their  area  of  responsibility.

Terminal  Aerodrome  Forecast  (TAF).  An  aviation  forecast  formatted  as  a  TAF according  to  AFMAN  15-124,  Meteorological  Codes,  provides  official  meteorological information for flight planning and command and control (C2) activities for a specific aerodrome complex.  OWSs and weather squadrons supporting space launch, missile or test missions, will 20 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 produce TAFs for AF or Army controlled airfields and joint base airfields where the AF or Army exercise Senior Airfield Authority (SAA) within their designated area of responsibility and Air Force weather personnel augment observations. (T-1).  Controlled airfields are defined as those sustaining  class  B,  C,  and  D  airspace  requiring  augmented  observations.    For  new  TAFs  in support of named operations,  TAF  generation will begin as specified in  the SAR, or within 48 hours  whichever  is  later.  (T-1).    For  new  TAF  support  for  non-combat  operations,  TAF generation  will  begin  as  specified  in  the  SAR,  or  within  15  business  days  of  SAR  submission, whichever is later. (T-1). 3.4.1.  An OWS will issue a TAF when: Table 3.7.  (DELETED) 3.4.1.1.  Requested via a SAR in accordance with AFMAN 15129, Volume 2, at airfields meeting the criteria in Paragraph 3.4, above.  (T-1) 3.4.1.1.1.  (DELETED) 3.4.1.2.  Requested  via  a  SAR  by  the  AF  service  component  or  unit  responsible  for providing  the  airfield  weather  support  function  in  accordance  with  AFMAN  15129, Volume  2,  for  an  OCONUS  airfield  where  the  AF  or  Army  is  designated  as  the  BOS-Integrator,  and  the  location  has  an  existing  non-DoD  issued  TAF  with  documented shortfalls  (e.g.,  availability,  timeliness,  amendment  criteria,  and  representativeness).  (T-1).    Note:  A  non-DoD  entity  may  be  responsible  for  providing  the  airfield  weather support  function  at  locations  with  an  existing  non-DoD  TAF.    In  such  cases,  the requesting  organization  will  evaluate  the  TAF  collaboration  requirement  and  work through  the  AFFOR  weather  staff  to  designate  weather  personnel  or  a  weather organization to conduct the collaboration. 3.4.2.  At locations where no AF weather personnel are deployed or stationed, and a TAF is requested,  the  OWS  will  provide  a  means  for  AF  weather  personnel  to  access  a  model-derived weather forecast labeled for military use only.

Issue TAF-coded forecasts, at a minimum, every 8 hours within 15 minutes after the file time during airfield operational hours. 3.4.3.1.4.  Encode Meteorological Codes. the  TAF-coded forecast  product IAW  AFMAN  15-124, 3.4.3.1.5.  Collaborate  with  supported  exploitation  units  prior  to  TAF  dissemination and formally document exploitation unit inputs. 3.4.3.1.6.  Disseminate all TAF-coded  forecast  products  (including amendments) via standard production and dissemination systems. 3.4.3.1.7.  Disseminate TAF-coded  forecasts  for limited operation  airfields not  more than  3  hours  before  the  airfield  opens.    Deviations  from  this  practice  will  be  by mutual  agreement  with  the  supported  unit  and  documented  on  the  installation  data page. 3.4.4.  TAF-coded Forecast Specification and Amendment  . 3.4.4.1.  Characterization units will: 3.4.4.1.1.  Specify the onset, duration, and intensity for the standard criteria in Table 3.8  throughout  the  valid  period  of  the  forecast.    Forecasts  will  be  amended  when conditions do not match specified conditions within Table 3.8. 3.4.4.1.2.  Specify and amend ceiling and visibility categories for US Army or US Air Force flight planning criteria throughout the valid period of the forecast.  The lower of the two conditions will determine the ceiling and visibility amendment category. 3.4.4.1.2.1.  Use ceiling and visibility specification criteria in Table 3.9 for TAF-coded forecasts issued for Army airfields. 3.4.4.1.2.2.  Use  ceiling  and  visibility  specification  criteria  in  Table  3.10  for TAF-coded forecasts issued for Air Force operating locations. 3.4.4.2.  Characterization units issuing forecasts for Joint/Coalition airfields will validate criteria  based  on  operational  requirements.    Use  Air  Force  ceiling  and  visibility specification criteria located in Table 3.10 when Air Force agencies operate the airfield.  Characterization  units  will  use  Army  criteria  from  Table  3.9  when  Army  organizations operate the airfield. 3.4.4.3.  Forecasters will employ trend data from standard display systems (e.g., Airfield Sensor Displays) to determine prevailing conditions. 3.4.4.3.1.  Prevailing  conditions  are  those  that  persist  for  at  least  30  consecutive minutes. 3.4.4.3.2.  Conditions  occurring once during  a specified time-period for less  than 30 consecutive  minutes  or  occurring  for  an  aggregate  total  of  less  than  30  minutes  of every cardinal hour are temporary. 22 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 3.4.4.3.3.  During periods of rapidly changing ceilings or visibilities crossing multiple categories,  consider  conditions  occurring  for  the  greatest  aggregate  total  during  a cardinal hour the predominant condition for that cardinal hour.

Generate  product  suite  in  Table  3.11  valid  at  3-hour  intervals  out  to  30  hours using the following rule set.  All graphical products, except theater thunderstorm forecast, will  be  valid  at  a  point  in  time  and  consistent  with  the  spatial  resolution  of  the  model selected  by  the  OWS  for  its  AOR  and  clearly  labeled  with  the  spatial  resolution  of  the depicted weather parameters. 3.5.2.1.1.  One hour prior to each valid period, update the next two product sets (i.e., next  valid  “Current”  and  “Current+3-hour”).    Update  additional  product  sets  as deemed necessary. 3.5.2.1.2.  Create a new product set for the 30-hour point, every three hours. 3.5.2.2.  Produce model-rendered products from 33-120 hours or greater (as applicable) at the temporal resolution of the model. 3.5.2.3.  Produce  Clouds  and  Horizontal  Weather  Depiction  (HWDs)  products  from gridded data fields.   AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 29  Table 3.11.  FITL Graphics Product Suite.

OWSs will refine all areas without causing the chart to be filled or covered in a way  that  confuses,  impedes,  or  reduces  the  effectiveness  of  the  chart.    OWSs  are  not required to  produce standard FITL  graphics products  covering regions  outside of AF or Army-controlled airfields and not routinely used for AF or Army air operations (low-use areas); however, OWSs will have processes and procedures in place for users to request, and  the  OWS  to  produce  and  disseminate,  standard  FITL  graphics  for  these  areas  if needed within 48 hours of SAR receipt. (T1).  OWSs may use model-generated output in lieu  of  FITL  products  for  areas  determined  to  be,  and  locally-documented  as,  low-use areas.    In  addition,  OWSs  will  employ  standard  forecast  techniques  for  FITL  graphic products. (T-3). 3.5.2.5.  MSL  Heights.    All  forecast  heights  on  OWS  thunderstorm,  icing,  turbulence products,  and  the  cloud  tops  on  theater  cloud  products  will  be  depicted  using  MSL values.    OWSs  will  take  into  account  the  geography  changes  in  the  AOR  to  prevent forecasting  MSL  bases  below  general  terrain  heights.    This  does  not  include  the  small-scale  changes  in  terrain  heights  (e.g.,  differences  between  mountain  peaks  in  close proximity),  which  EUs  will  integrate  into  the  mission  execution  forecast  process  to further refine forecasts. 3.5.2.6.  AGL Heights.  The OWS HWD and theater cloud forecast products will depict cloud bases as AGL height depictions. 3.5.2.7.  METWATCH  and  amendments  to  FITL  Graphics  Products.    OWSs  will METWATCH and amend standard graphics products for the criteria listed in Table 3.12.  Use  perishable  data  (e.g.,  Pilot  Reports  [PIREPS],  Significant  Meteorological Information,  Airmen’s  Meteorological  Information,  observations,  radar  data,  and METSAT  imagery)  and  NWP  output  available  at  forecast  hours  after  the  production cycle to METWATCH and amend products as required.

OWSs may utilize more than one NWP model when developing products. 3.6.6.  OWSs will depict all forecast periods provided by the model used. 3.6.7.  OWSs  may  produce  additional  automated  products  based  on  coordinated/validated supported user requirements. 3.7.  Military  Operation  Area  Forecast  (MOAF)  and  Joint  Operational  Area  Forecast (JOAF)  . 3.7.1.  Each  regional  OWS will provide  grid extraction from the  Global, Air-Land Weather Exploitation  Model  for  the  following  weather  elements:  cloud  cover,  winds,  temperature, visibility,  turbulence,  icing,  and  thunderstorms  for  use  in  mission  planning  and  execution forecasts. (T-1). 3.7.2.  Development of a MOAF/JOAF is based on a SAR and capabilities for products and services  derived  from  weather  production  units.    Development  of  a  MOAF/JOAF  for  new 32 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 contingences or exercises is done when requested by the AF component, or designated lead unit to the servicing OWS. 3.7.3.  MOAF/JOAF will clearly identify heights as AGL and/or MSL. 3.7.4.

(Added)  Units issuing surface observations and/or TAFs will: AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 33 3.9.1.1.  (Added)  Use  established  ICAO  location  identifiers  for  enduring  airfields coordinated  with  the  host  nation,  if  required.  (T-1).    KQ-identifiers  will  be  used temporarily until coordination is complete or the requirement to use a KQ-identifier has passed. (T-2). 3.9.1.2.  (Added)  Use KQ-identifiers  for temporary,  exercise, or classified locations, or as supplemental information at locations with an indigenous observation (see Paragraph 3.4.1.3).  (T-1).      Unclassified  KQ-information  qualifies  as  operations  sensitive  and combat  mission  sensitive  information,  and  access  is  controlled  according  to  DoDI 8520.03,  Identity  Authentication  for  Information  Systems.    Restrict  non-DoD  (e.g. allied/coalition)  access  to  only  the  specific  KQ-information  for  the  operation  in  which they participate; as specified by the CCDR or initial requestor of the KQ-identifier. (T-1).  Effective 1 year after the date of this publication, Unclassified documents, presentations, or  reports  based  on  surface  observations  issued  under  KQ-identifiers  are  protected  to comply with AFI 10-701 when linked to a location identifier. (T-1). 3.9.1.3.  (Added)  KQ-identifiers  will  be  restricted  to  military  use.  (T-1).    Units  that require surface observations and/or TAFs initiate a request for a KQ-identifier according to AFMAN 15129, Volume 2.  (T-2). 3.9.1.4.  (Added)  Units  that  request  KQ-identifiers  in  support  of  allied/coalition operations will make all efforts to  restrict non-DoD member  access to  only the specific KQ-information for the operation in which they participate. (T-1). 3.9.2.  (Added)  The  557th  Weather  Wing  (557  WW)  centrally  manages  the  KQ-identifier database on behalf of all US military services following guidance in AFI 15-128. (T-2).  The 557 WW releases  KQ-information according to the following: 3.9.2.1.  (Added-Effective  1  year  after  the  date  of  this  publication)  Unclassified surface observations and TAFs issued under KQ-identifiers are protected to comply with AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC). 3.9.2.2.

Refer to AFMAN 15-129, Volume 2, for SAR submission procedures. OWSs will support SARs for TAFs, MOAFs and WWAs.  If an OWS is unable to support they will  follow  the  procedures  outlined  in  paragraph  3.11.  and  send  a    formal  response  to  the requesting organization.  (T-1).  The requesting organization will notify their MAJCOM weather functional for situational awareness. (T-1). 3.11.  (Added)  Reallocation of Resources and Waivers. 3.11.1.  (Added)  In  the  event  that  an  OWS  is  unable  to  provide  standard  products  and services to  supported units they will inform  1st Weather Group (1 WXG) of their shortfall.  (T-2). 34 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 3.11.2.  (Added)  1 WXG has the authority to use their own risk management assessment to balance  workload  across  OWS  geographic  boundaries  as  needed  to  mitigate  surge requirements, enhance daily operations, and for back-up of tier 1 products.  (T-2).  Note, Tier 1  products  and  services  support  wartime,  contingency  and/or  force  protection  missions  and must be capable of being backed up via immediate transfer to  backup organization.

(T-1). AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 35 Chapter 4 WEATHER PRODUCTS FOR RESOURCE PROTECTION 4.1.  General.  Weather  units  conduct  a  continuous  METWATCH  to  identify  and  assess emerging  and  imminent  threats  to  installations  for  which  they  have  forecast  responsibility.  Special  Weather  Statements  (SWS)  and  WWAs  are  special  notices  provided  by  these  units resulting from both the forecast and METWATCH processes to  assist military decision makers with  resource  protection  decisions.    SWSs  provide  advance  notice  of  widespread  hazardous weather  conditions  that  have  the  potential  to  affect  military  installation(s).    Watches  and warnings  provide  notice  of  weather  events  posing  a  hazard  to  life  or  property.    Advisories provide specific notice to an operational agency of environmental phenomena with the potential to impact operations. 4.1.1.  WWA  Procedures.  Designated  units  produce,  disseminate,  and  amend  WWAs  to inform supported installations/sites of potential and observed weather conditions that require protective actions. 4.1.1.1.  Within their AOR, OWSs are designated as the responsible unit for all weather watches, except as noted in Paragraph 4.1.1.2.  Additionally, OWSs are responsible for all  WWAs  at  locations  without  assigned  AF  weather  personnel  responsible  for  airfield services. (T1). 4.1.1.1.1.  (DELETED) 4.1.1.1.1.1.  (DELETED) 4.1.1.1.2.  (DELETED) 4.1.1.1.3.  (DELETED) 4.1.1.1.4.  (DELETED) 4.1.1.1.5.  (DELETED) 4.1.1.1.6.  (DELETED) 4.1.1.1.7.  (DELETED) 4.1.1.1.8.  (DELETED) 4.1.1.1.9.  (DELETED) 4.1.1.2.  The  organization  with  fixed  based  weather  observing  systems  and  airfield support  functions  at  AF  or  Army-controlled  airfields  (class  B,C,  or  D  airspace),  is designated as the responsible unit for host installation forecast  warnings,  advisories and lightning  watches.    The  servicing  OWS  retains  responsibility  for  all  WWAs  issued  for geographically-separated  locations  (e.g.  test  ranges,  auxiliary  fields,  and  missile  fields) and installations where weather personnel are not assigned. 4.1.1.3.  During hours when an airfield is not controlled (i.e. tower is closed and air space is  no  longer  class  B,C  or  D)  and  the  servicing  OWS  does  not  retain  principal responsibility  for  issuing  WWAs,  the  servicing  OWS  will  have  procedures  in  place  to notify    installation-level  stand-by  weather  personnel  in  the  event  that  the  OWS 36 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 determines  a  forecast  warning,  advisory  or  lightning  watch  needs  to  be  issued  (i.e.,  a watch  is  issued  or  criteria  is  predicted).    This  provides  situational  awareness  and minimizes un-forecast weather impacts to operations and personnel. (T1). 4.1.1.3.1.  (Added)  The OWS will issue any required WWAs in situations where the weather  event  is  imminent  and  weather  unit  personnel  have  not  assumed responsibility for issuing WWAs.  An imminent event is one that is forecast to occur and must be issued to attain any positive lead time (DLT). (T-1). 4.1.1.3.2.  (Added)  The  OWS  will  issue  required  WWAs  in  situations  where  the notified unit cannot assume responsibility to meet full desired lead-time and the unit requests that the OWS issue the WWAs.  (T-1). 4.1.1.3.3.  (Added)  Once  notified,  the  local  weather  unit  will  assume  responsibility as  soon  as  possible  in  order  to  meet  DLT  for  any  WWAs  noted  in  4.1.1.2.    (T-1).  Local  weather  unit  leadership  is  responsible  for  establishing  recall  timelines  that facilitate  an  efficient  transfer  of  responsibility  and  ensure  the  safety  of  standby personnel.  (T-1)    If the local weather unit decides a WWA is not required, the OWS will  document  the  interaction  and  no  WWA  will  be  issued.    The  local  weather  unit assumed the risk for the notification criteria.  (T-1). 4.1.1.3.4.  (Added)  When  coordinated/documented,  observed  advisories  may  be issued by the servicing OWS. 4.1.1.4.  (Added)  Installation-level  organizations  with  civilian  and/or  contract  weather personnel  have  24  months  from  the  date  of  this  publication  to  modify  contracts  and civilian position descriptions to comply with Paragraphs 4.1.1.2 and  4.1.1.3. (T1). 4.1.1.5.  (Added)  Weather  squadrons  supporting  space  launch,  missile  or  test  missions are designated as the responsible unit for all airfield and supported range WWAs. 4.1.2.  When issuing WWAs the designated unit will: (T-1). 4.1.2.1.  (Added)  Time permitting, ensure coordination between the servicing OWS and weather unit to maintain horizontal consistency throughout all weather products. 4.1.2.2.  (Added)  Issue WWAs in a standard format and numbering scheme through the Integrated Weather Warnings Capability (IWWC) system for the following installations: 4.1.2.2.1.  (Added)  Active duty, guard, and reserve AF and Army installations. 4.1.2.2.2.  (Added)  Expeditionary operating locations in their AORs. 4.1.2.2.3.  (Added)  Homeland  Defense  sites  and  operations,  as  tasked  according  to Defense Support of Civil Authorities. 4.1.2.2.4.  (Added)  Special  sites  of  national  military  interest  (e.g.,  The  White House). 4.1.2.2.5.  (Added)  Major  Continental  United  States  (CONUS)  lock  and  dam facilities. 4.1.2.2.6.  (Added)  Joint, Coalition, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) munitions storage areas. AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 37 4.1.2.2.7.  (Added)  Space-lift  operations  and  assets  including  government,  military, and commercial facilities. 4.1.2.2.8.  (Added)  Joint  bases  where  the  Air  Force  or  Army  is  the  supporting component. 4.1.2.3.  (Added)  Use WWA text pre-loaded into IWWC to ensure uniformity.  Specific text may vary by location.  Text will be brief and clearly describe weather conditions in terms understood by all users of the product. 4.1.2.4.  (Added)  Include  the  maximum  expected  hail  size,  rain/snow  accumulation,  or wind  speed  as  applicable  in  warnings  and  advisories.    Additional  criteria  may  be specified by supported agencies. 4.1.3.  Warnings take precedence over forecast advisories for the same phenomena.  Forecast advisories  and  warnings  for  the  same  phenomena  will  not  be  valid  for  the  same  time. Conversely, observed advisories and forecast warnings for same phenomena may be valid at the same time (e.g. a forecast warning for 35-49kts may be valid while an observed advisory for GTE 25 kts is valid). 4.1.4.  Watches are stand alone products based upon potential and are unaffected by warnings or advisories for the same phenomena. 4.1.4.1.  Mandatory  watch  criteria  include:  tornados,  severe  thunderstorms,  damaging winds, lightning within 5 nautical miles (NM), and freezing precipitation as the potential warrants. 4.1.4.2.  Additional watch criteria may exist based upon supported agency requirements. 4.1.5.  Warnings and advisories are upgraded by adding a phenomena or crossing to a higher threshold  and  downgraded  by  removing  a  phenomena  or  crossing  to  a  lower  threshold  and will use the default wording for upgrading/downgrading in IWWC. 4.1.5.1.  (DELETED) 4.1.5.2.  (DELETED) 4.1.6.  Forecasted  warnings  and  advisories  will  maintain  horizontal  consistency  with  TAF and other forecast products.  Watches are not required to be included in the body of the TAF-coded forecast depending on circumstance. 4.1.7.  Units  that  issue  WWAs  will  coordinate  annually  with  each  supported  unit  and maintain  documented  WWA  thresholds,  DLT,  and  mission  impacts  (this  may  be accomplished  in  concert  with  annual  review  and  update  of  weather  support  plan,  or equivalent).    Table  4.1  provides  default  thresholds  and  desired  lead-times  to  use  when  the supported unit/agency does not specify a DLT or state a specific threshold. (T-1). 4.1.7.1.  Characterization  units  will  maximize  the  use  of  watches  within  their  effected regions until conditions warrant the issuance of a warning to meet desired lead-times for the supported organizations.  Watches should be issued at a minimum of one hour before a  warning  is  issued,  with  the  exception  of  the  lightning  watch,  which  should  be  issued with  at  least  30  minutes  before  the  lightning  warning  is  issued.    Issue  warnings  at  the desired lead times specified by the supported unit. 38 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 4.1.7.2.  Characterization units will use the default minimum desired lead-times in Table 4.1. only if the supported organization does not specify a minimum DLT. Table 4.1.  Weather Warning Defaults.

The responsible unit will provide 1 hour notice of the time that the snow event(s) meeting the 40 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 threshold are expected to begin. (e.g. Issue the warning at 11Z when snow is expected to start falling at 12Z and accumulate GTE 2” by 18Z.)   The warning text will indicate maximum expected snowfall accumulation during the period specified in the warning. 1 hour advance notice of onset, duration, and character (persistent or intermittent) of conditions meeting or exceeding threshold Imposes significant risk to personnel movement  Significant risk to maneuver or flight line activities Increased threat of flash flooding or systemic flooding posing credible threat to unprotected resources and personnel  Disrupts flightline and maneuver activities  Imposes increased risk on personnel movement  Disrupts personnel movement and aviation operations 1 hour advance notice of the period meeting or exceeding the heavy rain threshold  The warning will indicate onset, duration, and anticipated maximum rainfall accumulation 1 hour advance notice of the period meeting or exceeding threshold All of the following must occur: a) Surface visibility less than or equal to (LTE) ¼SM (400M) b) Considerable falling and/or blowing snow  c) Wind (sustained or gusts) GTE 30 kts  d) Duration GTE 3 hours 2” of liquid precipitation accumulating in LT 12 hours Blizzard Heavy Rain Sandstorm  Winds carrying sand particles from the surface up to 50 feet above the surface, prevailing visibility GTE 5/16 but LT 5/8SM (500 to 1000M).

Lead-time requirement determined by needs of the military decision making process at the affected installation.  Default lead-times will be used when a local requirement has not been specifically stated. Note 2.  Mandatory Installation SWAP criteria.   Note 3.  Installation SWAP activities dictated by local policy. 4.1.8.  Verification.  Warnings and advisories  will be verified using all available sources of representative sensed or observed data or subjective analysis (when appropriate and credible) for a specific geographic location based on the desired lead-time requirement of the warning or advisory product and the verification area specified in the criteria (e.g. the verification area of a warning for a “lighting within 5NM” is a radius of 5NM around the location). (T-1). 4.1.8.1.  WWA  products  will  specifically  state  the  area  affected  by  the  WWA  product. (T-1).  Normally,  this  is  a  circle  with  a  5NM  radius  around  the  center  of  a  runway complex or specified location.  The area enclosed by a 5NM radius circle is known as the verification  area  and  considered  “at  the  location”  for  verification  of  WWA  products.  WWA products issued for an area such as a missile field, exercise or maneuver area, or a range that are geographically irregular may not be associated with a specific point like an airfield  complex.    Weather  events  occurring  within  the  geographic  confines  of  the  area are considered “at the location” for verification purposes. 4.1.8.2.  Warnings  and  advisories  are  verified  using  sensed  or  observed  data  within  the verification  area  from  the  point  location.    For  example,  a  warning  for  lightning  within 5NM  of  an  airfield  is  issued  and  simultaneously  verified  based  on  lightning  strikes  or radar  returns  within  the  verification  area,  or  when  reported  as  occurring  on  station  in  a surface observation.  A forecast advisory for lightning within 25NM is verified based on lightning  strikes  or  radar  returns  within  the  verification  area,  or  when  reported  as occurring (within 25NM) in a surface observation.  When performing verification, units will: 4.1.8.2.1.  (Added)  Omit  reporting  locations  within  the  verification  radius  that  are not representative of the location receiving WWA products and document these sites in  forecast  reference  material  or  SOPs.  (T-3).    For  example,  wind  reports  from  a sensor that is mounted to a tower within the verification radius are excluded because 42 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 wind  speeds  at  that  elevation  do  not  accurately  represent  conditions  at  the  warned location. 4.1.8.2.2.  (Added)  Employ  all data available  from  representative sources of sensed or  observed  data  within  the  verification  area  to  objectively  verify  warnings  and advisories.    Sensed  data  from  radars,  mesonets,  environmental  monitoring  systems, tactical air traffic control (ATC) systems, forward armament and refueling points, or other  sensing  systems  are  considered  objective  data  for  evaluating  and  verifying WWA  products.  (T-3).    Unofficial  reports  from  credible  sources  (e.g.,  law enforcement, fire and rescue personnel, off duty AF weather personnel, storm spotter reports  etc.)  within the verification  area of the warned location will only  be used to verify  warnings  and  advisories  when  unit  leadership  determines  the  reports  are credible  based  on  corroborating  objective  weather  data  or  subjective  analysis  of relevant weather data. (T-3). (e.g., A weather Airman lives within a verification area and  notifies  the  unit  performing  verification  that  they  observed  3/4”  hail;  unit leadership determines whether this report is credible and can be used for verification). 4.1.8.2.3.  (Added)  When  objective  verification  is  not  possible,  inadequate,  or misrepresentative,  use  subjective  analysis  of  available  data  to  determine  if  an  event occurred.    In  situations  where  units  use  subjective  verification,  they  will  also  take responsibility  for  a  missed  occurrence  of  the  weather  threat  if  these  phenomena  are reported with no WWAs in effect at that time.

Units  issuing  WWAs  will  verify  each  phenomenon  separately  except  as indicated below. 4.1.8.4.1.  Severe thunderstorm and moderate thunderstorm warnings will be verified upon  first  occurrence  of  either  wind  or  hail  threshold  at  the  warned  location.  Occurrence  of  either  of  the  specified  criteria  in  severe  thunderstorm  and  moderate thunderstorm  warnings  verifies  these  warnings;  the  criteria  are  “bundled”  for verification purposes. 4.1.8.4.2.  Verify a lightning watch as if it were a forecast WWA product with a 30-minute  desired  lead-time.    Lead-time  will  be  based  on  the  issued  time  of  the  watch subtracted  from  the  time  of  first  occurrence  of  the  lightning  within  specification distance of the warned location. 4.1.8.5.  Verify  heavy  precipitation  warnings  using  measurements  from  the  airfield observing system, Doppler radar precipitation measurements, other rain gauges, or storm reports in the verification radius for the warned location. 4.1.8.5.1.  Heavy rain warnings specifying an accumulation in a specified time period.  These  warnings  will  be  verified  using  a  summation  of  the  one-hour  precipitation measurements  from  the  airfield  observing  system.    Collect  the  one-hour  amounts reported by the airfield observing system commencing with the cardinal hour that the AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 43 warning was issued and indicate on a weather warning verification tracker when the specified  precipitation  total  was  reached.    Continue  to  collect  the  one-hourly accumulations  during  the  valid  period  of  the  warning  and  enter  the  total  liquid precipitation  received  during  the  valid  period  of  the  warning  into  the  verification database. 4.1.8.5.2.  Characterization  units  will  use  accumulated  reports  of  six-hourly,  12-hourly,  or  summary  of  the  day  during  the  valid  period  of  the  warning  for  verifying heavy rain warnings at locations where the characterization unit does not have access to  the  hourly  rain  gauge  data  from  an  airfield  observing  system.    Actual  time  of occurrence may be estimated based on interpolations from the rate of accumulation in METAR or Synoptic reports. 4.1.8.5.3.  Characterization  units  with  access  to  WSR-88D  Doppler  radar  data  will use  radar  generated  precipitation  total  products  to  supplement  direct  measurements from a rain gauge, and verify precipitation accumulation warnings provided the data has been evaluated for accuracy (account for high reflectivity phenomena such as hail or  bright  band  contamination  of  the  data).    Characterization  units  may  use  radar measured  precipitation  products  from  other  radar  types  if  the  data  are  considered reliable. 4.1.8.5.4.  Characterization  units  may  use  reports  of  flooding  or  visible  damage within  the  area  covered  by  a  warning  as  subjective  verification  of  a  heavy  rain warning. 4.1.8.5.5.  Heavy  snow  warnings  will  specify  a  threshold  snow  accumulation  over  a specified period of time and will be verified using manually observed snowfall totals from  Air  Force,  sister  service,  coalition  partners,  or  host  nation  sources  where  the capability exists. 4.1.8.5.6.  In  the  absence  of  manual  snowfall  totals,  the  unit  conducting  verification of  a  heavy  snow  warning  will  convert  one-hour  liquid  precipitation  measurements into  hourly  snow  equivalent  according  to  procedures  in  AFMAN  15-111,  Surface Weather Observations. (T-1).  Collect the one-hour amounts reported by the airfield observing  system  commencing  with  the  cardinal  hour  that  the  warning  was  issued, and  indicate  on  a  weather  warning  verification  tracker  when  the  specified  snowfall total was reached.  Continue to collect the one-hourly accumulations during the valid period  of  the  warning  and  enter  the  total  snowfall  and  liquid  precipitation  received during the valid period of the warning into the verification database. 4.1.8.5.7.  Weather  radar  data  is  unreliable  for  determining  snowfall  and  will  not  be used  to  objectively  verify  heavy  snow  warnings.    Characterization  units  may  use radar  reflectivity  returns  to  subjectively  evaluate  heavy  snowfall  warnings  to  justify warnings that do not verify by other means. 4.1.8.5.8.  Characterization  units  will  use  accumulated  reports  of  six-hourly,  12-hourly,  or  summary  of  the  day  during  the  valid  period  of  a  heavy  snow  warning  at locations where the characterization unit does not have access to hourly data from an airfield  observing  system.    Actual  time  of  occurrence  may  be  estimated  based  on interpolations from the rate of accumulation in METAR or Synoptic reports.  Use the 44 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 observation  date/time  group  on  METAR  reports  with  Snow  increasing  rapidly remarks  (SNINCR  s/tt)  to  verify  heavy  snow  warnings  when  either  value  in  the remark meets or exceeds the warning threshold. 4.1.8.6.  During  a  disruption  in  service,  if  responsibility  for  WWAs  is  transferred  to another  unit,  that  unit  is  responsible  for  conducting  verification  and  entering  data  into IWWC until the service disruption is over and WWA responsibility is transferred back to the original unit. (T-1). 4.1.8.7.  Document sound meteorological reasoning used in determining the need for all forecast  WWAs  in  the  appropriate  spaces  provided  in  the  Air  Force  weather dissemination system. Figure 4.1.  (DELETED) 4.1.8.8.  Warnings and advisories fall into one of five verification categories (see Figure 4.2). 4.1.8.8.1.  Met  DLT:  Issued  and  verified  the  threshold  criteria  w/in  the  specified verification area and met (or exceeded) the desired lead-time. 4.1.8.8.1.1.  (DELETED) 4.1.8.8.1.2.  (DELETED) 4.1.8.8.2.  Positive Lead  Time:   Issued and verified with  positive lead time, but,  did not meet the full DLT. 4.1.8.8.3.

Lead-time Computation 4.1.9.1.  Actual lead-time is the time elapsed between the issue time of the warning and advisory and the first time of occurrence. 4.1.9.2.  Actual  lead-time  computation  for  warnings  and  advisories  that  are  downgrades from  an  existing  warning  or  advisory  is  based  on  the  issue  time  of  the  first  warning  or advisory  provided  there  is  no  break  in  coverage.    Ensure  there  is  no  break  in  coverage and a “DOWNGRADE” remark is appended to the new warning or advisory.  If a break in coverage does occur, actual lead-time will be computed from the new issue time. 4.1.10.  In  addition  to  the  verification  procedures  described  in  Paragraph  4.1.8.,  units performing  verification  will  use  techniques  according  to  AFI  15-114,  Weather  Technical Performance Evaluation. (T-1). 4.1.11.  Provide WWAs using the rules and information in Tables 4.2. and  4.3. 46 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 Table 4.2.  Rules for Issuing WWAs. 1.  A watch is not a substitute for a warning.  Units will issue warnings, as required, regardless of whether or not a watch had previously been issued.  2.  All WWAs are issued for specific and distinct locations. -  The area affected by a WWA will be clearly indicated in the text of the WWA. -  Watches may be issued for an area larger than the corresponding warning (e.g. Watch for high winds for Random AFB and surrounding local flying area. Warning for high winds for Random AFB [applicable to the aerodrome]). -  Warnings normally affect an area no larger than encompassed by a 5NM radius (except for lightning warnings that have a minimum radius of 5NM).  Document deviations in supported agency data pages or parent MAJCOM plans or instructions. - WWAs for Military Operating Areas (e.g., training areas, ranges, and missile complexes) may cover larger areas.  3.  The lightning watch and the observed lightning warning are stand-alone criteria and do not supersede WWAs previously issued for other criteria.  4.  A separate valid time may be specified for each criterion when warranted. -  All times used in a WWA will be expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and Local Time. Note: Local time is changed for Daylight Saving and does not always correspond to Local Standard Time. -  The beginning valid time for observed WWAs is when the criteria is first observed.  An ending valid time is not used for observed WWAs.  In place of and ending valid time, the following statement is used: "Valid until further notice."  5.  Do not issue a forecast WWA for a single unforecast event that is not expected to persist or recur.  Account for this as a RNI.  6.  When the responsible agency is not available, the servicing OWS will issue observed WWAs as capability exists.  7.  Only one weather forecast warning or advisory will be in effect at any given time for the same criteria.  This does not prohibit the use of a watch, a forecast warning, and an observed advisory being valid at the same time for different thresholds of the same criteria (e.g. A watch for GTE 50kts, a warning for 35-49kts, and an observed advisory for GTE 25kts all valid at the same time.)   8.  More than one forecast advisory may be in effect at the same time for the same location, but only one will be in effect for a particular criteria at the same time.    9.  When sufficient time does not exist to communicate a change in weather with the supporting OWS, weather units that do not normally issue WWAs may, without prior coordination, issue to facilitate resource protection actions.  When time permits, weather units will forward pertinent information to the servicing OWS and transfer responsibility for the WWA.  AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 47 Table 4.3.  Rules for Amending, Extending, and Canceling WWAs. 1.  When a WWA no longer adequately describes the phenomenon's occurrence, issue a completely new warning or advisory with a new number.  2.  WWAs may be extended provided the extension is issued prior to the expiration of the original notice.  3.  Clearly state how the amended, extended, or cancelled WWA affects any other issued notices for the same criteria (e.g. “This upgrades warning XX-XXX” or “This extends advisory XX-XXX” or when canceling “Watch XX-XXX for lightning within 5NM remains in effect” etc.)   4.  Cancel WWAs when conditions are no longer occurring and are not expected to reoccur within the DLT of the WWA.  Note: Observed WWAs are cancelled at the discretion of the responsible agency; normally 15 minutes after the last occurrence of the criteria when it is no longer forecast to occur.  5.  Lightning Watches are canceled only when the potential for lightning within the next 30 minutes is no longer forecast.  Do not cancel if there is potential for another thunderstorm within 30 minutes. 4.1.11.1.  (DELETED) 4.1.11.1.1.  (DELETED) 4.1.11.2.  (DELETED) 4.1.11.2.1.  (DELETED) 4.1.11.2.2.

When the primary notification system is inoperable, weather agencies issuing WWAs will  record  notification  and  verification  on  an  AF  IMT  3807,  Watch/Warning  Notification and Verification, or on an AF IMT 3806, Weather Watch Advisory Log, as applicable, until a global  database  capability  is  restored.    Instructions  for  completing  the  AF  IMT  3807  and 3806 are found in attachments 5 and 6 respectively. 4.2.2.  In  the  event  a  WWA  does  not  reach  the  intended  agency,  the  issuing  authority  is responsible for notifying ATC and the Command and Control (C2) authority responsible for the  Installation  Notification  and  Warning  System,  (per  AFI  10-2501,  Emergency Management Planning and Operations) as identified in the supported agency data page.  In the  event  additional  notifications  are  required,  they  will  be  documented  in  the  supported agency data page. 4.3.  Other Products. 4.3.1.  SWS.    OWSs  will  issue  SWS  products  to  notify  military  decision  makers  of widespread  severe  weather  events  affecting  military  installations  serviced  by  the  OWS.  SWSs will be routinely updated as conditions warrant. 48 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 4.3.1.1.  SWS  is  a  stand-alone  product  normally  issued  48-72  hours  in  advance  of  the forecast event. 4.3.1.2.  SWS  will  be  an  A/N  product  describing  the  type,  onset,  duration,  and  area impacted by the event and will be disseminated via common user communications. 4.3.1.3.  SWS may also include graphical depiction of the forecast event. 4.3.1.4.  OWSs will communicate the potential of significant weather events to supported WFs  (as  applicable)  for  evaluation,  prior  to  dissemination  of  SWSs  to  the  WF’s supported parent/host unit(s). 4.3.2.  Space  Weather.    Characterization  units  will  host  on  their  webpage,  appropriate theater-specific space weather products issued by the 2d Weather Squadron (2 WS). 4.3.3.  Volcanic  Ash.    Characterization  units  will  host  appropriate  theater-specific  volcanic ash  products  on  their  webpages.  The  primary  source  is  the  WMO  volcanic  ash  advisory centers (VAACs).  If responsible VAAC cannot produce the volcanic ash products, then the 2WS will be the primary source.  Characterization units will include remarks in text forecasts horizontally consistent with the VAAC products where applicable. 4.3.4.  Characterization  units  may  produce  additional  products  to  meet  WF  requirements based on specific operational necessities as documented on the data page. 4.3.5.  Characterization  units  may  leverage  unique  products  from  other  meteorological agencies to include US, civilian, and military agencies (e.g., Naval worldwide oceanographic products),  and  foreign  nation  products.    These  products  will  be  displayed  directly  or  will exist as links to the operational products hosted elsewhere. 4.3.6.  (DELETED) 4.3.6.1.  (DELETED) 4.3.6.2.  (DELETED) 4.3.6.3.

Transmit  required  products  and  data  via  common-user  communication  and satellite communication networks, as required for supported operations in their AOR. 4.4.1.3.  Disseminate  TAFs  to  WFs  and  other  supported  users  (if  applicable)  using  AF dissemination  systems.    Characterization  units  may  use  MAJCOM-approved  theater specific, or joint dissemination systems as required. AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 49 4.4.1.4.

(T-1).  NWS warnings may cover an area that does not impact the  installation,  but  impacts  installation  personnel  within  the  commuting  area.  Coordinate the need for river flood, flash flood, fire weather (red flag), coastal flood, and tsunami watches and warnings as follows: 4.4.1.5.1.  (Added)  Weather leadership  at  the installation coordinates with  local  AF emergency  management  personnel  to  determine  criteria  and  locations  that  require dissemination.  Supported weather leadership will coordinate with the servicing OWS in accordance with AFMAN 15-129, Volume 2.  Note:  For joint installations where the AF has the lead for WWAs, the emergency management personnel may be from another service. 4.4.1.5.2.  (Added)  In  the  absence  of  a  local  weather  unit,  the  servicing  OWS coordinates  with  the  installation  emergency  management  personnel  and  sets  up dissemination procedures. 50 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 Chapter 5 TROPICAL SUPPORT OPERATIONS 5.1.  Tropical  Support  Operations.  Tropical  cyclones  pose  a  significant  threat  to  lives, property,  and  operations.    Military  decision  makers  at  affected  installations  are  driven  by directive to take time-phased actions to evacuate or shelter personnel and aviation assets that are largely  influenced  by  forecast  elements.    OWSs  provide  detailed  information  based  on  the official  track  forecast  to  facilitate  efficient  and  effective  evacuation,  survival,  and  post  event reconstitution  activities.   Horizontal  consistency  between  national  centers,  OWSs,  Air Operations  Centers,  and  installation-level  weather  personnel    is  critical  to  successful  planning and execution of military operations driven by tropical cyclone events. 5.1.1.  Procedures  .    Characterization  units  will  fully  exploit  on-line  forecast  resources provided  by  tropical  cyclone  forecast  centers  (i.e.,  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center  (Miami, FL),  the  Central  Pacific  Hurricane  Center  (Honolulu,  HI),  and  the  Joint  Typhoon  Warning Center (Pearl Harbor, HI)). 5.1.1.1.  Characterization units will not deviate from the official forecast  position, track, movement,  forecast  cone,  and  maximum  wind  speed  associated  with  a  tropical  cyclone except for the following. 5.1.1.1.1.  Warnings and advisories issued  for feeder band convective activity (away from the storm center) may exceed forecast maximum wind for that time period. 5.1.1.1.2.  Characterization  units  may  adjust  forecast  wind  speeds  if  terrain,  foliage, and land use data for an affected location indicates higher or lower wind speeds than originally forecasted. 5.1.1.2.  OWSs  will  depict  tropical  cyclone  centers,  and  caveat  that  moderate  to  severe flight  hazards  are  implied  in  and  near  tropical  cyclones.    The  non-convective  flight hazards in  areas where synoptic-scale features interact  with  the tropical  cyclone will be depicted on graphical charts. 5.1.1.3.  Characterization  units  will  perform  METWATCH  responsibilities  and  serve  as the primary liaison between the tropical cyclone forecast centers and EUs. 5.1.1.4.  Queries  for  tropical  storm  information  from  non-operational  sources  will  be directed  to  publically  available  products  from  responsible  forecast  agencies  (National Weather Service (NWS), National Hurricane Center (NHC), etc). 5.2.  Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment Product (TC-TAP).  The purpose of the TC-TAP is to  provide  a  standardized  product  for  exploitation  units  to  use  in  assisting  installation commanders and Emergency Management personnel in making decisions on the evacuation and sheltering of aircraft and personnel, and on other mitigation actions. 5.2.1.  OWSs will produce a coordinated TC-TAP for supported locations within their area of responsibility (AOR) expected to experience sustained winds ≥ 35-knots during the next 96 hours as a result of a tropical cyclone.

MWPs may be planning or execution products and are not limited to aviation missions.  Analysis and Forecast Program (AFP) - A systematic and consistent approach to weather forecasting. The AFP identifies techniques and tools used to forecast individual weather elements, describes requirements for locally prepared work charts/composites, and explains refinements and application of centralized products. 60 AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 Analysis  and  Forecast  Program  (AFP)—  A  systematic  and  consistent  approach  to  weather forecasting.  The  AFP  identifies  techniques  and  tools  used  to  forecast  individual  weather elements,  describes  requirements  for  locally  prepared  work  charts/composites,  and  explains refinements and application of centralized products. Climatology— The historical records of weather conditions measured or observed at a specific location  is  knows  as  climatology.  Some  data  go  back  over  100  but  generally  a  10-  to  25-year history  is  more  common.  Climatology  is  useful  in  planning  operations  beyond  5  to  7  days.  It usually  describes  the  average  (or  mean)  conditions  such  as  high  and  low  temperatures  and extremes. Desired Lead Time (DLT)—The total amount of time required to disseminate a forecast WWA from the supporting OWS through the local dissemination tree to all affected end-users plus the amount  of  advance  notice  a  supported  organization  requires  to  complete  mandatory  protective actions before the onset of a particular weather phenomenon. False Alarm— When a lightning watch, weather warning, or forecast weather advisory is issued and the specified criteria do not occur during the specified valid time. Forecaster-In-the-Loop (FITL)— Term covering a range of human activities to ensure forecast information is meteorologically sound. FITL activities span a broad spectrum from a basic review and editing of information to a detailed production process resulting in forecaster-created weather products such as graphical forecast products or mission specific environmental impacts decision aids. FITL  Graphics  (Standard)—  A  suite  of  weather  products  depicting  standardized  criteria, created by forecasters in an Operational Weather Squadron for a specific geographic region. These products represent the sum of the forecasting activities for basic weather parameters necessary for creation of mission execution forecasts. Forecast  Weather  Advisory  (FWA)—  A  weather  advisory  issued  when  the  supported  user requires advance notification of an impending weather condition with sufficient time to allow for protective actions. Forecast  Worksheet—  Tool  used  to  document,  track,  and  evaluate  past  and  future  weather events.  It  may  contain  forecast  rules-of-thumb,  question  and  answer  discriminators,  decision logic trees, etc., to help develop a forecast. Horizontal  Consistency—  Weather  data  provided  in  one  product  that  is  consistent  to  data provided in another product for the same area and time. For example, TAFs must be consistent with all other products, including the current observation, weather warnings, weather advisories, lightning watches, etc. Elements within each TAF must also be consistent, for example, if heavy snow showers are forecast, the visibility will be restricted appropriately. Strong gusty winds or hail  would  generally  be  expected  if  severe  thunderstorms  were  forecast.  Product  consistency prevents supported users from receiving conflicting information. ICAO Identifier— A specifically authorized 4-letter identifier assigned to a location. The ICAO is not to be confused with the Routing Identifier used by the Automatic Digital Weather Switch AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 61 to transmit addressed messages including Automated Response to Queries.

Issue Time— The time when an agency is notified of a watch, warning, or advisory. When more than  one  agency  is  notified,  the  issue  time  is  the  time  the  last  agency  is  notified.  Follow-up notifications are not considered when determining issue time. Joint  Operational  Area  Forecast  (JOAF)—  The  JOAF,  as  approved  by  the  Joint Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Officer (JMO), is the official planning forecast for all components of the joint force. It is issued at the Joint Force Commander (JFC) level to ensure that all components are aware of what the JFC is using to plan the coordinated battle. Significant deviations  from  the JOAF will be coordinated with  the JMO. Components and individual units will use the JOAF as the point of departure to tailor METOC information and to develop tailored mission execution forecasts. The JOAF may include a forecast database when needed for tactical decisions used in planning.

A3.1.6.7.5.  Watch  Cancelled  .    Enter  the  dissemination/notification  time,  the initials of the forecaster cancelling the watch, and the initials of the person receiving the  cancellation  if  that  agency  requires  a  backup  call  or  is  not  on  the  primary dissemination system.  If the watch runs full term, enter an appropriate remark such as "allowed to expire" or "ATE." A3.1.6.7.6.  Warning Issued  .  Enter the dissemination/notification time, the initials of  the  forecaster  issuing  the  warning,  and  the  initials  of  the  person  receiving  the warning if that agency requires a backup call or is not on the primary dissemination system. A3.1.6.7.7.  Warning  Cancelled  .    Enter  the  dissemination/notification  time,  the initials  of  the  forecaster  cancelling  the  warning,  and  the  initials  of  the  person receiving  the  cancellation  if  that  agency  requires  a  backup  call  or  is  not  on  the primary  dissemination  system.    If  the  warning  runs  full  term,  enter  an  appropriate remark such as "allowed to expire" or "ATE." A3.1.6.8.  Block 8. Remarks  .  Use for miscellaneous information. A3.1.6.9.  Block  9.  Pertinent  Observations  (back  of  form).    List  all  pertinent observations,  both  "official"  and  "unofficial,"  radar  information  if  available,  and  other information  that  verifies  and/or  justifies  the  watch/WW,  or  provides  reasoning  why  the warning  was  not  cancelled  when  it  did  not  verify.    Include  available  information  (i.e. radar information, off-duty observer reports, locally reported weather conditions) used to verify warnings for winds greater than or equal to 50 knots or hail greater than or equal to AFMAN15-129V1  6 DECEMBER 2011 73 3/4  inch  (or  the  substituted  local  severe  weather  thresholds  where  different)  that  are reported  or  observed  within  10  nautical  miles  rather  than  in  the  area  covered  by  the warning.
