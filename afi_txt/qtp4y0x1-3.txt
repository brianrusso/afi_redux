These QTPs are designed to enhance the 5-skill level on-the-job training (OJT) of the dental assistant journeyman.  Training references listed in each module may be used to complement training.  All QTPs are intended to be used by trainees, trainers, supervisors, and task certifiers.  Before initiating any training you should review your responsibilities as a supervisor/ trainer for conducting OJT per AFI 36-2201, Chapter 6, Air Force Training Program On-The-Job Training Administration.   QTPs are instructional packages designed to help you conduct and evaluate your field 2. training.  Once you begin upgrade training you are required to use the QTPs.  QTPs provide continuity to the trainee’s upgrade training and are divided into the following volumes:  1) Basic Skills and Infection Control/Sterilization; 2) Clinical Skills-Radiology; 3) Clinical Skills-Chairside Assisting; 4) Clinical Skills-Preventive Dentistry; 5) Patient Administration, 6) Logistics Management; 7) Budget and Financial Planning and 8) Supervision and Training.  The QTP modules were designed to assist you in preparing for and conducting training.  Each module segments the major tasks into teachable elements.  Your goal is to provide enough training and guidance so trainees can do all task related steps, without assistance.  QTPs also aid OJT task certifiers in evaluating the trainee’s demonstrated performance.  If you have local training requirements not covered by a QTP module you should develop “steps in performance” and “performance checklists” that support and standardize those tasks. When you are satisfied the trainee meets standards, as prescribed in the QTP performance checklist, you must document each task completion in the QTP tab.  If a person is being recertified on a task that is supported by a QTP you must use that module to complete the recertification process.   Typically, you will manage each module by first, training the tasks and then, evaluating 3. performance.  Your local steps in performance may vary from the method listed in the QTP module.  If this is the case, you are authorized to make changes to the first half of each module, (i.e. steps in task performance); however, the “performance checklist” is considered a standard and cannot be altered.  You may train each QTP volume/module in any sequence; however, when conducting training use an organized and methodical approach.  This will reduce your training time and enhance your efforts. The QTPs are a tool for assessing/certifying the Dental Assistant initially and each time they 4. arrive at a new duty station.  The QTP should be used as a tool for standardizing annual refresher training. Our goal has been to publish a useable document for both the trainee and trainer. We value your first hand expertise and solicit your feedback on how we can improve our product.

NOTE: The evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and correct the member if performance is detrimental to patient safety.   STEPS IN TASK PERFORMANCE: 1.  Begin the cementation process by isolating the treatment site with clean, dry cotton rolls and drying the prepared tooth or teeth with a gentle blast of warm air or a cotton pellet and cotton forceps 2.  Prepare the cement according to the manufacturer’s instructions 3.  Place cement into each retainer or crown in a manner that eliminates the possibility of trapped air 4.  Seat the prosthesis over the prepared tooth (teeth) and apply firm finger pressure to the occlusal or incisal surface to express the excess cement; the dentist accomplishes the final seating with heavier pressure 5.  In anterior areas, the final seating can be accomplished by taping the appliance in place using an orangewood stick or plastic mallet 6.  In posterior areas, the orangewood stick and mallet can be used; however the patient is generally instructed to bit into balsa wood or on an orangewood stick that is placed over the prosthesis. In  61 this manner, the patient is applying biting pressure for the final seating. While the cement is still fluid, use a sharp explorer tip to examine the marginal fit and verify that the restoration is completely seated 7.  To ensure that the area remains dry while the cement sets, place the saliva ejector into the patient’s mouth 8.  Do no attempt to remove excess cement until it has set to the point of being “brittle-hard.” After the cement hardens, use and instrument, such as a periodontal curette, to remove all cement from around the restoration, tooth, and gingival sulcus area 9.  Before dismissing patients with fixed prosthetics, instruct them in the procedures of cleaning the appliances. This is especially necessary if the appliance contains a pontic or is a fixed splint; use the show and tell approach 10. Show these patients what superfloss or a floss threader is, show and tell them how to use these items and have them do what you have shown them 11.
