A2.2.  Uniform Guide List (UGL) of Typical Moral Conduct Offenses: A2.2.1.  Use  Table  A2.2.  to  classify  moral  offenses  based  on  Air  Force  conduct  offense categories.  For moral offenses not listed in the UGL table, align the offense to the proper Air Force  category  based  on  the  seriousness  of  the  offense  and  the  maximum  possible confinement  and  or  fine  under  local  law.    Use  paragraphs  A2.2.1.1.  –  A2.2.1.5.  in conjunction with the UGL Table A2.1. to determine proper classification. A2.2.1.1.  Category  1  “Major  Misconduct”  Moral  Offenses.    In  doubtful  cases,  treat violations  of  a  similar  nature  of  seriousness  as  a  category  1  offense.
