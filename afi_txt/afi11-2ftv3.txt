Scope.  AFMC  produces  a  three-volume  set  of  Flight  Test  (FT)  instructions  containing attachments for each weapon system flown in AFMC.  These instructions are numbered AFI 11-2FT Volume 1, 2, and 3, and contain the training, evaluation criteria, and operations procedures, respectively, for each weapon system.  AFMC uses these instructions in lieu of AFI 11-2 MDS-specific Volumes for flying operations.  In the absence of published guidance, AFMC units may generate  locally  developed  guidance  IAW  Paragraph  1.4  (T-2).    If  possible,  these  guidelines should be consistent with similar guidance specified in the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-specific lead MAJCOM Volumes.  In addition, units will fly aircraft on loan to AFMC undergoing short-term flight test programs according to the lead MAJCOM guidance if no AFMC guidance exists. (T-2). 1.2.  Recommended Changes.  Send comments and suggested improvements to this volume on AF  Form  847,  Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication,  through  channels  to  AFMC/A3V.  All correspondence can be emailed to the AFMC/A3V Workflow.  HQ AF/A3 will approve  all interim changes to this instruction. 1.3.  Waivers.  Route  all  waivers  through  appropriate  channels  to  flying  unit  commanders,  and Operations  Group  Commanders  (OG/CCs)  (defined  as  the  Operations  Group  Commander  or equivalent authority having Flight Operations Authority (FOA)) prior to submitting to the tiered waiver  authority  IAW  AFI  33-360.    Use  an  AFMC  Form  73,  AFMC  Waiver  and  Approval Request, to process waivers requiring approval above wing level. 1.3.1.  AFMC/CC delegates AFMC/A3 as the T-2 waiver authority for AFI 11-2FT Vol 3. 1.3.2.  Process  T-3  waivers  IAW  AFI  33-360.    AFMC/A3V  is  the  T-3  waiver  authority  for units without flying wing commanders. 1.3.3.  AFMC/A3V determines waiver authority for non-tiered statements. 1.4.  Unit  Supplements.  Email  unit  supplements  to  AFMC/A3V  Org  for  review  and  approval prior to publication.  Include AFMC/A3V and AFMC/A3O on the distribution list for approved supplements to AFI 11-2FT Volume 3. 1.5.  Developmental  Aircraft.  Units  will  conduct  developmental  aircraft  operations in accordance  with  this  instruction  and  approved  test  plans.  (T-2).    New  aircraft-specific attachments are created when the aircraft reaches a maturity level that warrants inclusion. 1.6.  Inter-fly.  Inter-fly  is  the  exchange  or  substitution  of  aircrew  members  between  AFMC operations  groups,  MAJCOMs,  DoD  services,  or  U.S.  government  organizations  and  agencies.  Normally,  inter-fly  should  be  limited  to  specific  test  programs  or  other  special  circumstances.  As  a  minimum,  crews  will  be  qualified  in  the  aircraft  design  and  series  as  well  as  systems  or configurations  required  to  fly  the  aircraft  and  mission.  (T-2).    Crew  members  must  thoroughly brief  the  procedural  guidance  of  the  operating  MAJCOM,  DoD  service,  U.S.  governmental organization or agency. (T-2).  OG/CCs may authorize inter-fly agreements by mutual agreement with  other participating  units.  Formalize agreements  through a memorandum  of understanding between  participating  organizations.    A  formal  inter-fly  agreement  is  not  required  for  aircrew AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 9 that occasionally act as “guest help” where the OG/CC has accepted the credentials of the guest aircrew.    Formally  designated  Combined  Test  Force  (CTF)  organizations  do  not  need  inter-fly agreements  for non-AFMC aircrews assigned to the CTF.  For aircraft possession  and transfer, reference AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming,  Assignment, Distribution, Accounting, and Termination. 10 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 Chapter 2 MISSION PLANNING 2.1.  General.  Aircraft  commanders and flight leads are ultimately  responsible for ensuring all mission  planning  materials  are  current  and  command  guidance  is  followed.    All  crewmembers and  formation  members  must  be  present  for  mission  planning  unless  released  by  the  aircraft commander or flight lead. 2.2.  Mission  Planning  Requirements.  The  unit  commander  must  ensure  that  a  flight operations  area is  available  with  adequate  space  for  operations  management,  flight planning/briefing,  and  required  publications.  (T-3).    The  unit  commander  will  ensure  that aircrews are provided the following: 2.2.1.  Mission requirements and schedule of events. (T-3). 2.2.2.  Briefing facilities and aids described in paragraph 2.9. (T-3). 2.2.3.  Current  Flight  Information  Publications  (FLIP).    Access  to  current  FLIP  may  be  via paper or electronic means.  For electronic FLIP, a computer/electronic device with access to applicable websites must be readily available to aircrews. (T-2).  If using electronic products, units must develop a plan for aircrew FLIP access in case of internet outage. (T-2). 2.2.4.  As  a  minimum,  aircrew  must  have  access  to  the  following  FLIP  products  and associated documents:   General  Planning, Area  Planning  - North  and South  America, other applicable Area Planning volumes, Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Supplement, Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Supplement, applicable instrument departure and arrival procedures, applicable instrument  approach  volumes,  applicable  En  Route  and  Navigational  Charts,  Flight Information Handbook, Airman’s Information Manual. (T-2). 2.2.5.  Commanders  will  ensure  the  Airfield  Suitability  and  Restrictions  Report  (ASRR)  is available  to  aircrews,  mission  planners,  and  other  personnel  as  required.  (T-2).    Also, commanders  will  ensure  procedures  to  ensure  personnel  can  access  and  use  the  ASRR  to include number of accounts and office of responsibility. (T-3). 2.2.6.  Communications  equipment  for  use  in  obtaining  weather,  local  airfield  conditions, notices  to  airman  (NOTAM),  and  filing  flight  plans.    All  aircraft  must  have  MAJCOM approval to operate aircraft using the Jeppesen Navigational Data Base, and, if approved, are directed to consult the Jeppesen Navdata Alerts/NOTAMS website before each flight located at www.jeppesen.com (Aviation Resources). (T-2). 2.2.7.  Digital  Flight  Publications.    There  are  several  methods  to  obtain  digital  flight publications: 2.2.7.1.  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  National  Aeronautical  Charting  Office (NACO)  digital  Terminal  Procedures  Publications (d-TPP)  are  available  at: https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/dtpp/        from any  web  enabled  computer.    DoD  National  Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency  (NGA)  d-FLIP is available at https://www.geointel.nga.mil/ from a computer that can access .mil domains.  The procedures from these sites can be used in-flight as long as the dates listed on the product are valid. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 11 2.2.7.2.  The DoD (NGA) has contracted with Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. to provide access to Jeppesen’s internet-based worldwide library of aeronautical terminal navigation charts and text documents.  All members of the DoD may now access this information from any web-enabled computer: http://www.jeppesen.com.  Guidance regarding the use of non-FAA (NACO), or non-DoD (NGA) procedures contained in AFI 11-202V3 still applies. 2.3.  Mission  Planning/Takeoff  and  Landing  Data  (TOLD)  Software.  If  not  manually computed  using  the  flight  manual  data,  mission  planning  and  TOLD  computations  should  be accomplished  using  the  lead  MAJCOM  certified  software  for  that  MDS  aircraft.    If  certified software  does  not  exist  or  is  unavailable,  other  mission  planning  programs  (contractor-developed, Jeppesen, etc.) can be used, but aircrew must verify this through manual calculations using certified data. (T-2).   If an AF-approved mission  planning system,  such as Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) or Portable Flight Planning Software/Combat Flight Planning Software (PFPS/CFPS) is used to mission plan, any chart produced satisfies chart requirements set forth in this  instruction.    The  flight  crew  is  responsible  for  ensuring  current  data  bases  (i.e.  Vector Vertical  Obstruction  Data  (VVOD),  Digital  Aeronautical  Flight  Information  File  (DAFIF))  are loaded and that mission planning data is correctly entered. 2.4.  Inflight Publications. 2.4.1.  Carry sufficient maps, charts, and FLIP to navigate for both the planned IFR and VFR phases  of  flight.    For  local  flights,  detailed  aircrew  aids  that  contain  this  information  are sufficient.  See AFI 11-202V3 Chapter 3 for use of electronic in-flight publications. 2.4.2.  Inflight Manuals/Directives. The Pilot In Command (PIC) will ensure that applicable flight manuals, checklists, and mission related directives (if required) for all mission required crew  positions  are  carried  in  flight.  (T-2).    The  OG/CC  will  determine  required  mission directives.    Aircrew  will  carry  all  applicable  technical  orders  aboard  the  aircraft  or  in  the Remotely  Piloted  Aircraft  (RPA)  control  station.  (T-2).    If  a  conventional  paper  copy  of  a flight manual and/or checklist is not available through distribution or local printing, or if the unit uses electronic flight bags (EFBs), then two independent/redundant sources, verified as current  and  operational,  of  accessing  the  manuals/directives  must  be  available  to  the  crew.  EFBs used IAW MDS specific operating instructions satisfy this requirement if the unit has been  approved  paperless  transition.  (T-2).    See  AFI  11-202V3  Chapter  3  for  use  of electronic in-flight publications. inadequate  secure 2.4.3.  Aircraft  with inflight  publications  storage.  When  mission requirements involve flight  maneuvers that may  create a Foreign Object  Damage (FOD) or safety  hazard  by  the  abruptness  or  intensity  of  maneuvers  the  OG/CC  will  specify  the minimum  required inflight  publications and FLIP to  be carried.  As a minimum,  each crew position must have an aircraft checklist. (T-3). 2.4.4.  On  local  sorties,  OG/CCs  may  authorize  aircrew  to  carry  an  abbreviated  set  of instrument  approach  procedures  (IAPs)  in  lieu  of  carrying  the  entire  FLIP  approach  plate book(s)  for  the  local  area.    As  a  minimum,  ensure  the  onboard  abbreviated  set  of  IAPs includes all pertinent approaches to the local area divert bases. (T-2).  This abbreviated set of approaches will be standardized by the OG/CC and explicitly authorized in unit supplements to AFI 11-2FT Vol 3. (T-2).  Procedures to ensure the most current approach procedures are included in the abbreviated set will be established and documented by the OG/CC. (T-2). 12 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 2.5.  VFR Low Altitude Charts.  Aircrew must use low altitude charts for low-level operations. (T-2).    Ensure  charts  are  updated  with  current  VVOD  and  DAFIF.  (T-2).    Color  reproduced charts are authorized provided it is a quality facsimile of the original chart containing essential terrain data and features.  Aircrew members will supplement existing mission planning materials (e.g. VVOD, FLIP AP/1B, etc.) with either Sectional Aeronautical Charts or Air Force approved  mission  planning  software  generated  charts  with  the  following  information  for  use  inflight: Airports/Heliports,  Airspace  Boundaries,  Airways,  Military  Training  Route  (MTR),  Parachute Jump,  and  Special  Use  Airspace  (SUA)  Boundaries.    Use  of  Sectional  Aeronautical  Charts  in flight  is  not  required.    Note:  Helicopter  aircrews  conducting  controlled  burn,  firefighting,  and search  and  rescue  operations  are  exempt  from  this  requirement.    If  practical,  conduct  an  area survey for obstructions prior to commencing these operations. 2.5.1.  Required Annotations.  Low level charts must contain the following, when applicable (T-2): 2.5.1.1.  Location  and  dimensions  of  Class  B/C/D  airspace,  civil/military  airfields,  and other  potential  high  density  traffic  areas  (e.g.  parachute  activity  areas,  ultralight/hang glider/glider sites, etc.) within 5 nautical miles (NM) of any planned VFR route or MTR lateral boundary. 2.5.1.2.  Applicable airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity of Class B, C, or D airspace. 2.5.1.3.  The  intersection  of  other  Visual  Military  Training  Route/IFR  Military  Training Route (VR/IR) routes and any other possible areas of conflict. 2.5.1.4.  Noise sensitive areas/no-fly areas. 2.5.1.5.  Emergency airfields along the route of flight. 2.5.1.6.  Safe Altitudes (N/A C-130 and V-22.  See MD-specific attachments). 2.5.1.6.1.  Annotate all maps with an Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA) for the overall route/area. (T-1).  Compute the ESA by adding 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain  as  defined  in  AFI  11-202V3)  (500  feet  for  helicopters)  to  the  highest obstacle/terrain  (rounded  to  the  next  highest  100  feet).    For  training  areas  use  the highest obstacle within the training area and 5NM beyond the lateral boundary.  For route  planning  use  5NM  either  side  of  planned  course  but  in  no  case  less  than  the route  boundary.    Planners  may  compute  several  ESAs  for  route  segments  transiting significant terrain differentials or a single ESA for the entire route. 2.5.1.6.2.  Annotate all maps with a Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) for each leg. (T-1).    Compute  an  MSA  by  adding  1,000  feet  (500  feet  for  helicopter  and  tilt-rotor aircraft  operating  in  Conventional  (CONV)/Vertical  Take  Off  and  Landing  (VTOL) mode) to the highest obstacle/terrain (rounded up to the next 100 feet) within 5 NM of the planned course, but in no case less than the route boundary. 2.6.  Local  Area  Maps  and  In-flight  Guides.  Pilots  and  navigators/combat  systems  officers (CSOs) will carry a local  area map that depicts special use airspace,  alternate airfields, jettison areas,  and  controlled  bailout  areas,  as  applicable  to  the  aircraft  and  mission.  (T-3).    The  local area  map  is  not  required  if  the  In-flight  Guide  is  current  and  includes  this  information.  AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 13 Additionally, FLIP enroute charts may be used instead of maps on IFR navigation flights within areas adequately covered by these charts. 2.7.  Local  Aircrew  Aids.  Aircrew  aids  should  be  tailored  to  aid  the  unit  in  performing  its mission.  Unit aircrew aids may be tailored for each MDS as necessary.  The following areas are recommended for inclusion: 2.7.1.  Airfield diagrams. 2.7.2.  Local radio channelization. 2.7.3.  Takeoff and landing data. 2.7.4.  Weight and balance data. 2.7.5.  Impoundment procedures. 2.7.6.  Emergency action checklists. 2.7.7.  No Radio (NORDO) procedures. 2.7.8.  Bailout and jettison areas. 2.7.9.  Recovery procedures with weapons onboard and jettison areas. 2.7.10.  Hot brake areas and procedures. 2.7.11.  Divert  procedures/alternate  and  emergency  airfield  information.   Units  will document  completion  of  an  Operational  Risk  Management  (ORM)  analysis  if  using emergency airfields that have runway lengths less than that listed in Table 2.1 or in the flight manual for their respective aircraft. 2.7.12.  Cross-country procedures. 2.7.13.  Other  information  as  deemed  necessary    (e.g.  stereo  flight  plans,  turnaround procedures, local training areas, instrument preflight, and maintenance brevity codes). 2.8.  Test  Cards.  Flight  test cards are  constructed according to  local  procedures and will have the  appropriate  level  of  authorization.  File  a  copy  of  the  test  cards  at  the  operations  desk  for supervisor reference. 2.9.  Briefing/Debriefing  Room  Requirements.  Briefing  rooms  must  provide  privacy  and adequate size to seat required crewmembers and test team members.  They may be multipurpose rooms,  but  privacy  should  be  ensured  during  aircrew  mission  briefings.    Briefing  rooms  must contain, electronically or otherwise: 2.9.1.  Briefing  guides  for  applicable  missions  and  supplemental  material  as  locally determined, such as Emergency Procedure of the Day lists, etc. 2.9.2.  A dry-erase board or suitable substitute. 2.9.3.  Visual aids (such as slide display boards, charts, briefing books, viewgraphs, computer display, etc.) to adequately present, as applicable to each unit, the following: 2.9.3.1.  Airfield diagrams depicting runways, taxiways, parking areas, and other special use areas as appropriate (for example, arm/de-arm areas, hot brake areas, hydrazine areas, etc.). 14 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 2.9.3.2.  Training  rules  (air-to-air,  air-to-ground,  chase,  intercept,  low-level,  etc.),  when appropriate. 2.9.3.3.  Visual aids for air refueling procedures (when appropriate). 2.9.3.4.  Local  area charts depicting the local  flying  area;  VFR patterns, including  entry and  departure  procedures;  special  use  airspace  (SUA);  alternate  airfields;  locally established  air  refueling  areas/routes;  controlled  bailout  areas;  air-to-air,  air-to-ground, Functional  Check  Flight  (FCF),  jettison,  drop  zone  or  salvo  areas;  and  supersonic areas/ranges normally used by the unit. 2.10.  Briefing/De-briefing. 2.10.1.  Aircraft  commanders  (AC)  or  flight  leaders  (FL)  are  responsible  for  presenting  a logical briefing that promotes safe, effective mission accomplishment.  Use briefing guides to provide a reference list of items that may apply to particular missions.  Items listed may be briefed in any sequence.  In addition to requirements specified in AFI 11-202V3 and AFI 11-202V3  AFMC  Sup,  ACs/FLs  will  brief  crew  members  from  a  guide  that  contains,  as  a minimum: (T-2). 2.10.1.1.  Airfield Status and Notice to Airman (NOTAMs). 2.10.1.2.  Radar and visual search responsibilities. 2.10.1.3.  Mid-air collision avoidance. 2.10.1.4.  Interior/exterior aircraft lighting configuration for Night Vision Google (NVG) operations (if applicable). 2.10.1.5.  Illumination conditions (moon illumination, depression angle, End(ing Evening Nautical Twilight (EENT), cultural lighting, etc) for NVG operations (if applicable). 2.10.1.6.  Chase procedures (if required). 2.10.1.7.  When  aircraft are flown in formation, brief proper position (to ensure adequate wingtip  clearance),  responsibilities  and  aircraft-unique  requirements  for  each  phase  of flight. 2.10.1.8.  Altitude  Awareness  (Warning  Systems  and  Techniques).    During  the  briefing for all low-level missions, place emphasis on obstacle/ground avoidance, employment of all  aircraft  altitude  warning  features,  pilot  determination  of  low  altitude  comfort  level, and human factors associated with low altitude flying such as proper task prioritization. 2.10.1.9.  Alternate airfields. 2.10.1.10.  Test hazard minimizing procedures/test plan flight restrictions. 2.10.1.11.  Training rules. 2.10.1.12.  Specific mission procedures. 2.10.2.  Standards.    Those  briefing  items  understood  by  all  participants  may  be  briefed  as "standard".  Units may use standards as long as they are in a published document.  However, during  sorties  where  trainees  or  unassigned  personnel  are  in  the  flight,  ensure  all  items  are briefed. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 15 2.10.3.  All  crewmembers and required test support personnel  will attend the flight  briefing unless previously briefed and excused by the aircraft commander. (T-3). 2.10.4.  All aspects of test missions will be thoroughly briefed by the cognizant engineer or aircraft  commander.  (T-3).    If  required,  brief  actions  to  terminate  the  flight  test  profile.  Where critical flight parameters have been identified for elevated risk flight test, the aircraft commander will establish appropriate termination criteria and assign a test team member to monitor  those  parameters  in-flight.  (T-2).    Each  flight  will  brief  an  alternate  mission,  if applicable. (T-3).  The  alternate mission should be less complex than the primary.  Briefed mission elements and events may be modified and briefed airborne as long as flight safety is not compromised.  Missions or events not briefed prior to mission execution cannot be flown.  Flight leads will ensure changes are acknowledged by all flight members. (T-3). 2.10.5.  If  the  flight  briefing  was  conducted  prior  to  the  day  of  the  flight,  the  aircraft commander  or  flight  lead  will  ensure  all  members  are  briefed  on  current  and  forecast weather, NOTAMs, and any mission changes prior to stepping to the aircraft. (T-3). 2.10.6.  Debrief  all  missions.    Conduct  the  debrief  in  a  location  with  suitable  tools  to accomplish,  as  a minimum,  an evaluation  of the  mission objectives, test objectives, lessons learned,  and  execution  errors.    Aircrews  should  debrief  weather  conditions  to  weather personnel when weather encountered during the mission was not as forecast. 2.11.  Passenger Briefing Guides.  On passenger carrying aircraft, passengers will be provided a pre-printed  passenger  briefing  guide.  (T-3).    Use  lead  MAJCOM  briefing  guides  where appropriate.  If none exist, aircrew will use the general briefing guide in the attachment section. (T-3). 2.12.  Bird  Avoidance.  Generally,  the  hour  before  and  after  sunrise  and  sunset  presents  an increased threat  of a bird strike, with  migration seasons  posing a significant  hazard at  different times.    Pilots  should  follow  locally  developed  BASH  procedures  as  well  as  those  outlined  in AFPAM  91-212,  Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  (BASH)  Management  Techniques,  to minimize aircraft exposure to bird strikes.  Additionally: 2.12.1.  Aircrews  operating  within  the  continental  U.S.  reference  the  most  current  Avian Hazard Avoidance System (AHAS) for all low altitude portions of flight, to include takeoff and  landing,  instrument  approaches,  low-level  operations,  and  range  operations  that  occur less  than  3,000  feet  above  ground  level  (AGL).    This  information  is  available  at www.usahas.com.    Operations  at  bases  with  established  BASH  procedures  do  not  require reference to AHAS during takeoff, landing, or instrument approaches.  If AHAS information is  not  available  for  the  operating  location,  attempt  to  use  existing  bird  models  to  mitigate risk.    When  Next  Generation  Weather  Radar  (NEXRAD)  is  lower  than  the  AHAS  Risk, aircrew may use NEXRAD for a period of one hour from the NEXRAD report.  If unable to obtain a NEXRAD update, transition to the procedures required by the AHAS Risk when the NEXRAD expires. 2.12.1.1.  Flying operations are not restricted when AHAS Risk is LOW. 2.12.1.2.  AHAS Risk of MODERATE is a warning to all aircrew to maintain a vigilant lookout  for  bird  activity,  particularly  in  the  low  altitude  environment.    Reducing  speed and/or minimizing flight below 3,000 feet reduces the risk of bird strike.  When AHAS Risk is MODERATE, limit low altitude, high-speed events (low-level navigation, air-to-16 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 surface weapons delivery, terrain following/terrain avoidance (TF/TA)) below 3,000 feet to only those required for syllabus training, currency, or for approved flight test events. 2.12.1.3.  AHAS Risk of SEVERE is a warning to aircrew to avoid this region. Aircrew will  remain  above  3,000  feet  for  all  events  in  regions  where  the  current  AHAS  Risk  is reported  as  SEVERE.  (T-3).    All  test  and  test  support  mission  events  requiring  flight below  3,000  feet  AGL  in  areas  where  the  AHAS  Risk  is  SEVERE  require  OG/CC  or TG/CC approval prior to execution. 2.13.  Normal/Minimum/Emergency Landing Fuel.  See Table 2.1.  Plan to arrive on initial or downwind, as appropriate for aircraft type, or at the final approach fix with no less than Normal fuel, and land with no less than Minimum fuel.  If it becomes apparent an aircraft may land with less than Minimum fuel, pilots shall declare minimum fuel with Air Traffic Control (ATC).  If it becomes  apparent  an  aircraft  may  land  with  less  than  the  Emergency  fuel  listed  in  Table  2.1, pilots shall declare an emergency with ATC. (T-2). 2.14.  Authorized  Fuel  Loads.  Load aircraft with  fuel  according to  requirements of Technical Order (T.O.) 1-1B-50, the handbook of weight and balance data, and the MDS specific T.O. 1X-XXX-5-1.  Units may develop alternate fuel loads to support modified aircraft or special mission requirements.  Document and approve these alternate fuel loads in a Modification Flight Manual (MFM) IAW AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program, as supplemented. 2.15.  Aircraft  Movement  on  the  Ground  .  For fixed wing aircraft, takeoffs are restricted to wet  runway  conditions  or  better.    Pilots  must  account  for  the  fact  that  taxiways  and  ramps typically have a lower runway condition reading (RCR) than reported for the runway.  Refer to the  MDS  flight  and/or  performance  manual(s),  and  MD-specific  attachments  to  this  instruction for further RCR restrictions.  OG/CC has authorization to authorize takeoff on runway conditions worse than wet but not to exceed flight and/or performance manual limits. 2.16.  Minimum Runway Lengths.  Pilots must comply with the minimum runway lengths used for  all  planned  airfield  operations  in  Table  2.1.  (T-2).    Pilots  are  encouraged  to  use  the  entire runway length available for takeoff, mission permitting.  Aircraft gross weight, performance and weather  conditions  may  dictate  longer  runway  requirements  than  the  minimum  prescribed  in Table  2.1.   If there are  no explicit requirements outlined in  the MD-specific attachment,  pilots must ensure the runway available for landing exceeds total planned landing distance by at least 1,000  feet.  (T-2).    If  applicable,  take  into  account  inoperative  systems  (anti-skid,  etc.).    For developmental  aircraft,  minimum  runway  length  is  described  in  the  aircraft-specific  safety package. 2.16.1.  Runway  available  (Fighter/Attack/Trainer).    Unless  further  guidance  is  provided  in this  instruction’s  MD-specific  attachment,  do  not  take  off  if  the  computed  ground  roll exceeds 80 percent of the runway available.  Do not execute a formation takeoff if the ground roll exceeds 50 percent of the runway available. 2.16.2.  Take  Off  and  Landing  Data  (TOLD)  (Fighter/Attack/Trainer).    Compute  the  following  TOLD  (if  applicable):    acceleration  check  speed,  refusal/maximum  abort  speed, rotation speed, takeoff speed and distance, single engine takeoff speed, normal landing speed and  distance,  heavy  weight  landing  speed,  single  engine  landing  speed.    All  computations should  take  runway  condition  and  the  possibility  of  drag  chute  failure  into  account  if applicable. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 17 2.16.3.  Intersection Takeoffs (All aircraft).  Intersection takeoffs are permitted if the runway remaining meets minimum length criteria specified in paragraph 2.16.1, and Table 2.1. Table 2.1.  Command Minimums Reference Chart. See MD-specific attachments for additional restrictions or clarifying comments. FUEL MIN. RUNWAY LENGTH MIN.

Note 4: Stressed width Note 5: As listed or in accordance with approved safety plans.   Note 6: See MD-specific attachment for additional guidance.  Note 7: 75 feet (23 meters) required to accomplish 180 degree turn. Note 8: 35 feet required to complete a 180 degree turn at 70 degree nacelle.  2.17.  AFMC  Close  Watch  Mission/Unusual  AFMC  Flight  Operations.  For  AFMC  Close Watch missions or non-routine air operations of AFMC aircraft and/or AFMC aircrew members involving FCF, ferry, or deployment outside of the Continental United States, aircrew members will  follow  AF  acknowledged  reporting.    Units  will  contact  AFMC/A3O  for  notification guidance and consult AFMCI 11-207, AFMC Close Watch Mission Monitoring for guidance. (T-2). 2.18.  Minimum  Equipment  List  (MEL)  .    The  MEL  is  a  pre-launch  document  that  list  the minimum  equipment/systems  to  operate  the  aircraft.    It  is  impractical  to  prepare  a  list  that anticipates  all  possible  combinations  of  equipment  malfunctions  and  mission  driven circumstances.  Reference aircraft attachment, test planning, technical / safety review board, etc. for MEL guidance. 2.19.  Aerial  Refueling  Coordination  .    Prior  to  tanker  crew  step,  the  tanker  and  receiver should  ensure  that  in-flight  refueling  requirements  and  administration  (altitude,  altimeter, location,  approximate  timing,  boom  frequency,  required  offload,  etc.)  is  complete  and  is understood  by  both  crews.    Complete  the  coordination  in  person,  via  written  communications (such as coordination sheets) or via voice communications as permitted by local guidance. 2.20.  Elevated  Risk  Flight  Test.  AFMCI  99-103,  Test  Management,  provides  guidance  for crew requirements during elevated risk flight testing. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 19 Chapter 3 MISSION GUIDANCE 3.1.  General.  This chapter contains guidance that applies to all AFMC aircraft.  Guidance that is  airframe  specific  is  contained  in  this  instruction’s  attachments.    This  chapter  is  divided  into five sub-sections: Common, Tactical and Systems, Air-to-Air, Air-to-Surface and Low Altitude, and Flight Test Missions. 3.1.1.  The test and safety review process does not have authority to grant exception to this or any other AFI.  Nor do they grant exceptions to T.O.s or Preliminary T.O.s.  Waiver requests must  follow  guidelines  published  in  the  respective  publications  and  AFI  11-215  for applicable Flight Manual T.O.s. 3.2.  Common Mission Operations. 3.2.1.  Local Area Orientation (LAO).  LAO flights occur during the day as defined by AFI 11-202V3.    MD-specific  guidance  is  provided  in  this  instruction’s  attachments  where required. 3.2.2.  Instrument Landing System (ILS) Precision Runway Monitoring (ILS PRM).  AFMC aircrew are prohibited from flying  ILS approaches requiring PRM unless there is a mission need,  and  the  pilots  at  the  controls  have  accomplished  ILS  PRM  training.    MD-specific guidance is provided in this instruction’s attachments where required. 3.2.3.  Theater Indoctrination.  AFMC flying units conducting flying operations to and from deployed  locations  outside  of  the  CONUS  will  ensure  aircrews  are  thoroughly  trained  for specific  theater  operations.  (T-2).    MD-specific  guidance  is  provided  in  this  instruction’s attachments where required. 3.2.4.  Touch-and-Go  Landings.    Touch-and-go  landings  are  authorized  in  AFMC.    See paragraph 5.25 and MD-specific attachments for specific guidance. 3.2.4.1.  Flying  unit  CCs  may  approve  touch-and-go  operations  with  maintenance engineering  support  personnel  (MESP)  or  mission  essential  personnel  (MEP)  onboard and will document pre-approval on the flight authorization. 3.2.5.  Approach  and  Landing  (N/A  for  helicopters  and  V-22  when  executing  vertical landings).    Use  reported  RCR  when  computing  landing  ground  roll.    When  the  computed landing  ground  roll  exceeds  80  percent  of  the  available  runway,  land  at  an  alternate  if possible.  In the absence of a reported RCR, land at an alternate, if possible, when the base of intended landing has worse than wet  runway conditions.  For tail-hook equipped aircraft, if an alternate is not available, an approach end or mid-field arrestment should be considered.  For  fixed  wing  aircraft,  landing  on  a  runway  with  a  reported  condition  worse  than  wet runway  (not  to  exceed  flight  and/or  performance  manual  limits)  requires  OG/CC authorization. 3.3.  Tactical and Systems Mission Operations. 3.3.1.  Air-to-Air  Refueling  (AAR)  Tanker.    MD-specific  guidance  is  provided  in  this instruction’s attachments where required. 20 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 3.3.2.  Air-to-Air  Refueling  Receiver.    Conduct  air  refueling  operations  in  accordance  with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Allied Tactical Publication (ATP) 3.3.4.2., Air-to-Air  Refuelling,  and  the  guidance  provided  below.    Conduct  helicopter  and  tilt-rotor  air refueling operations in accordance with this instruction’s MD-specific attachments. 3.3.2.1.  Do not conduct  air refueling after known losses of tanker disconnect capability (including tanker manual operation without tanker disconnect capability, or manual boom latching) unless necessary to recover the aircraft. 3.3.2.2.  Reverse  air  refueling  and  manual  boom  latching  procedures  training  must  be under direct instructor supervision. (T-2).  Brief procedures used for these events during mission planning.  In-flight coordination between receiver pilot and boom operator must include briefing items  as required by applicable  air refueling T.O.s.  (T-2).  Ensure both tanker and receiver air refueling systems are fully operable. 3.3.2.3.  Do  not  accomplish  practice  emergency  separation  training  from  the  contact position or boom limit demonstration unless the receiver signal system is in normal and the receiver and tanker  have  assured normal  disconnect  capability prior  to  initiating the maneuver.    Each  aircraft  conducting  a  practice  emergency  separation  must  first  verify tanker disconnect capability prior to the practice emergency separation contact. (T-2). 3.3.2.4.  For  practice  emergency  separation  training,  coordination  between  the  tanker pilot, boom operator and the receiver pilot is mandatory and will occur prior to the event. (T-2).    The  pilots  and  boom  operator  must  ensure  in-flight  coordination  includes  when the  maneuver  occurs  and  who  gives  the  command  of  execution.  (T-2).    Tanker  pilot coordination with the boom operator may be accomplished over interphone. 3.3.2.5.  For boom envelope demonstrations, the receiver pilot and the boom operator will discuss the maneuver prior to accomplishment. (T-2).  In-flight coordination must include the receiver pilot informing the boom operator when commencing the demonstration, the limit  to  be  demonstrated,  and  when  terminating  the  demonstration.  (T-2).    Tanker disconnect  capability  must  be  verified  by  a  boom  operator  initiated  disconnect  prior  to receivers conducting limits demonstrations. (T-2). 3.3.2.6.  NVGs may be worn for night tanker rejoins to include flying in the observation position.  Aircrew must raise them to the up and stowed position or remove them prior to the pre-contact position. (T-2).  NVGs may be returned to the “on” position post-AAR, if not  in  the  pre-contact  or  contact  position.    In  all  cases,  assess  tanker  external  lighting conditions to determine if using NVGs is appropriate. 3.3.3.  Functional and Acceptance Check Flight (FCF/ACF). 3.3.3.1.  Units will perform FCFs and ACFs according to T.O. 1-1-300, Functional Check Flight Procedures, T.O. 1X-XX-6CF-1, Functional Check Flight Manual, T.O. 1X-XX-1 Flight Manual and associated Partial/Modification Flight Manuals (MFM) and applicable AFMC instructions. (T-2).  FCFs following programmed depot maintenance (PDM) must also  follow  the  current  work  specification.  (T-2).    In  the  absence  of  an  applicable  T.O. 1X-XX-6CF-1,  the  applicable  Original  Equipment  Manufacturer  (OEM)  in  conjunction with  the  program  office  will  develop  FCF  and  maintenance  action  guidance  for  that aircraft.    FCFs  for  other  reasons,  such  as  major  aircraft  repair,  modification,  cyber-security testing, or extended aircraft downtime (as defined by T.O. 1X-XX -6CF-1) can AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 21 be  tailored.    The  FCF  aircrew,  aircraft  maintenance  and  sustaining  engineering  activity will determine the FCF procedures to accomplish. (T-2).  An FCF or ACF using the O-8E mission symbol is intended to ensure the aircraft is airworthy in accordance with T.O. 1-1-300  and  are  subject  to  all  applicable  restrictions.    Per  T.O.  1-1-300,  primary  aircraft systems  affecting  airworthy  status  are  engines,  flight  controls,  landing  gear  and instruments  affecting  instrument  flight  rules  (IFR)  capability.    All  other  FCF  and  ACF flights may use the O-8F mission symbol and follow the restrictions associated with that mission. 3.3.3.2.  Modified  aircraft.    When  an  aircraft  has  original  equipment  modified  or  new equipment  added  that  is  not  covered  by  USAF  T.O.s,  the  contractor  or  lead developmental  test  organization  (LDTO)  will  provide  ACF/FCF  or  airworthiness procedures.  (T-2).    The  need  for  FCF  after  a  T-2  modification  is  determined  by  the aircraft  maintenance  activity.    These  procedures  augment  those  already  defined  in  the T.O. 1X-XX-6CF-1.  Incorporate conduct of the first flight after a major T-2 modification requiring  verification  of  system  airworthiness  into  an  approved  test  plan.  The  aircraft manufacturer or contractor will define FCF procedures for developmental aircraft. 3.3.3.2.1.  Cyber  test  and  evaluation  has  been  mandated  for  all  aircraft  weapon systems.    The  testing  is  normally  conducted  in  both  cooperative  and  adversarial scenarios.  The cooperative vulnerability testing  identifies possible vulnerabilities in the aircraft or aircraft systems and may do so through the use of code inserted into the aircraft  system  software  in  cooperation  with  system  operators  to  determine  effects.  Adversarial  testing  consists  of  actual  attempts  to  infiltrate  the  sub-system  and/or aircraft level systems without the cooperation of the system operators.  Both phases of testing  have  the  possibility  of  compromising  software  and/or  components.    The aircraft will not be flown during cyber testing. 3.3.3.2.1.1.  Aircraft and aircraft system return to service following cyber test and evaluation.  Due to the dynamic nature of cyber testing, not all scenarios can be accounted for in this publication; therefore, the System Program Office (SPO) is responsible  for  coordinating  recommendations  on  returning  assets  to  flight  and airworthiness status following cyber testing. 3.3.3.3.  Tail hook equipped aircraft.  Units will conduct initial FCF (O-8E) flights from a runway  with  compatible  approach  and  departure  end  cables  or  barriers.  (T-2).    Local guidance determines runway specific cable and barrier configurations. If no such runway is available, then an initial FCF may still be accomplished if there is a suitable alternate airfield with compatible cables within 50 nautical miles and recovery fuel allows for the possible  divert.    Units  will  ensure  the  weather  at  the  alternate  airfield  meets  FCF requirements. (T-2). 3.3.3.4.  Use of Check  Flight  Cards.   Unit  developed check  flight  cards  may  be used in lieu  of  the  T.O.  1X-XX-6CF-1checklist  provided  they  are  derived  from  the  applicable T.O. 1X-XX-6CF-1 checklist and are approved by the OG/CC. 3.3.3.5.  Flight Conditions.  Aircrew will comply with restrictions published in T.O. 1-1-300  and  the  take-off  weather  minimums  specified  in  Table  3.1.  (T-3).    Aircrew  must accomplish  preflight  inspections  for  ACF/FCF  flights  during  daylight  hours.  (T-3).  Additionally,  aircrew  will  not  conduct  the  initial  preflight  inspection  during  periods  of 22 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 precipitation to prevent masking fluid leaks. (T-3).  Aircrews will terminate all daylight-required flight operations prior to official sunset. (T-3). Table 3.1.  ACF/FCF Take-off Minimums.

AGL) may be accomplished with a minimum of 1 mile visibility (no ceiling requirement). Subsequent  ACF/FCF (O-8F) 1500/3 1000/3 1000/3 1000/3 3.3.3.6.  Combined FCF and ACF Flights.  IAW T.O. 1-1-300, flying wing commanders (or equivalent) may authorize the combination of FCFs with other mission/training flights if  the  FCF  is  being  conducted  to  evaluate  auxiliary  aircraft  systems.    For  units  without flying wing commanders, AFMC/A3V is the waiver authority.  The decision to approve a combined FCF and ferry flight is the responsibility of AFMC/A3V. 3.3.3.7.  Aircraft Release.  If a malfunction occurs during an FCF, which is not related to the condition  generating the FCF, and the original  condition  operationally  checks  good, the aircraft may be released for flight  pending  resolution  of the new malfunction.  This does not apply to post PDM FCFs. 3.3.4.  Advanced  Handling  Characteristics/Advanced  Handling  Maneuvers  (AHC/AHM).  AHC  and  AHM  maneuver  definitions  are  provided  in  Air  Force  Tactics,  Techniques,  and Procedures  (AFTTP)  3-3.MDS.    Further  MD-specific  guidance  is  provided  in  this instruction’s attachments where required. 3.3.5.  Fighter/Trainer  Formation  and  Flight  Lead.    These  procedures  apply  to  all  fighter, attack  and  trainer  aircraft.    For  all  other  aircraft,  refer  to  MD-specific  attachments  to  this instruction.  Formations and sub-elements will be led by a qualified flight lead. (T-2).  In all cases, wingmen are responsible for deconfliction unless otherwise briefed. 3.3.5.1.  Formation Definitions.  Formation definitions are in accordance with AFTTP 3-3.MDS  or as briefed.  Formation positions for dissimilar formations  must be briefed by the flight lead. (T-3). 3.3.5.2.  Taxi. 3.3.5.2.1.  Day.    Minimum  taxi  interval  is  150  feet  if  taxiing  staggered,  300  feet  if taxiing  in  trail  (on  the  taxiway  centerline).    Spacing  may  be  reduced  when  holding short of or entering the runway. 3.3.5.2.2.  Night.  Minimum taxi interval is 300 feet, and the aircraft will taxi on the taxiway centerline. (T-3). 3.3.5.2.3.  Runway/Taxiways with ice/snow/slush.  Minimum taxi interval is 300 feet, and the aircraft will taxi on the taxiway centerline. (T-3). AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 23 3.3.5.2.4.  Pilots will not taxi in front of aircraft being armed/de-armed with forward firing ordnance. (T-3). 3.3.5.3.  Takeoff. 3.3.5.3.1.  Pilots  must  ensure  takeoff  interval  between  aircraft  or  elements  is  a minimum of 10 seconds. (T-2).  Fifteen seconds is the minimum separation when the previous aircraft uses afterburner.  When executing a trail departure, in anticipation of a  rejoin  above  the  weather,  the  minimum  takeoff  interval  is  20  seconds.    When  the previous aircraft is carrying live or inert air-to-surface weapons, the minimum takeoff interval is 20 seconds. 3.3.5.3.2.  Flight  lead  will  brief  runway  lineup  and  abort  procedures.  (T-3).    Flight lead  will  call  for  brake  release  over  the  radio  during  night  formation  takeoffs  if approved, see paragraph 3.3.5.3.4.4 (T-3). 3.3.5.3.3.  Wingmen  will  be  positioned  on  the  upwind  side  of  the  runway  when crosswinds  are  greater  than  5  knots.  (T-3).    Minimum  wingtip  clearance  is  10  feet.  Pilots must ensure spacing between separated elements or flights on the runway is at least 500 feet. (T-3). 3.3.5.3.4.  Formation takeoffs are restricted to elements of two like (same model and design) aircraft.  Aircraft must be symmetrically configured if carrying air-to-surface ordnance  and/or  fuel  tanks,  and  loaded  such  that  a  trim  or  control  application  to counter a heavy wing or yaw during takeoff is not required. (T-3). 3.3.5.3.4.1.  Aircrew must ensure the runway is at least 125 feet wide (140 feet A-10). (T-3). 3.3.5.3.4.2.  Aircrew must ensure ceiling and visibility are at least 500 feet and 1 1/2 miles. (T-3). 3.3.5.3.4.3.  Formation  takeoffs  are  prohibited  if:  slush,  snow,  ice,  or  standing water is on the runway; effective crosswind component or crosswind gust exceeds 15  knots  or  flight  manual  limits,  whichever  is  lower;  the  computed  takeoff  roll exceeds  50%  of  the  available  runway;  aircraft  are  loaded  with  live  or  inert  full scale  munitions  (excluding  air-to-air  missiles  and  internal  gun  ammunition,  or practice bombs). (T-3). 3.3.5.3.4.4.  Night  formation  takeoffs  are  prohibited  unless  waived  for  mission requirements by the OG/CC. 3.3.5.4.  Rejoins. 3.3.5.4.1.  Daytime.  Weather minimums for rejoin underneath a ceiling are 1,000 feet and 3 miles visibility. 3.3.5.4.2.  Night.  Weather  minimums  for  rejoin  underneath  a  ceiling  are  3,000  feet and  3  miles.  During  the  rejoin,  wingmen  remain  at  least  1,000  feet  AGL.    The  last aircraft  will  keep  the  anti-collision  beacon  and/or  strobe  on  and  position  lights  on unless otherwise directed by the flight lead. (T-3). 3.3.5.5.  Trail  Departures.    Trail  departures  can  be  unaided  or  aided.    Unaided  trail departures rely primarily on timing for separation.  Aided trail departures rely on timing 24 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 and  air-to-air  radar,  or  data  link  information  to  maintain  separation.    The  term  “tied” refers  to  aircrew  that  have  achieved  situational  awareness  on  the  preceding  aircraft  via air-to-air  radar  or  data  link  information.    The  desired  aircraft  separation  for  all  trail departures is 2-3 NM. 3.3.5.5.1.  Takeoff  spacing  is  a  minimum  of  20  seconds.    The  flight  lead  must  brief the  initial  power  setting  for  takeoff  and  acceleration,  climb  power  setting  and airspeed, and level off airspeed. (T-3). 3.3.5.5.2.  Each  aircraft  (or  element)  will  maintain  20  seconds,  or  2-3  NM  spacing using all  applicable aircraft systems  and navigational  aids.  (T-3).   Make  all heading changes IAW standard instrument procedures not to exceed 30 degree of bank. 3.3.5.5.3.  On departure, each aircraft (or element) will follow the No Radar Contact procedures until all aircraft/elements have called “tied.” (T-3). 3.3.5.5.4.  Radar equipped aircraft (or elements) will call "tied" when radar contact is established with the preceding aircraft. (T-3).  Alternatively, aircraft equipped with a data link system that displays the relative position of the preceding  aircraft will call “tied” when airborne with a valid data link. (T-3).  No further radio calls are needed once all aircraft are "tied" unless contact is lost. 3.3.5.5.5.  Each  aircraft  (or  element)  will  maintain  at  least  1,000  feet  vertical separation  from  the preceding  aircraft during  climbs,  descents,  and  at  level-off until “tied”  with  the  preceding  aircraft,  except  in  instances  where  departure  instructions specifically preclude compliance. (T-3). 3.3.5.5.6.  In the event a visual join-up cannot be accomplished on top or at level-off, the  flight  lead  will  request  1,000  feet  of  altitude  separation  for  each  succeeding aircraft  (or  element)  that  is  not  “tied”  providing  all  aircraft  can  comply  with  MSA restrictions. (T-3).  If the MSA cannot be complied with, vertical separation may be reduced to 500 feet.  The flight lead should request Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) squawks for wingmen that must remain in trail. (T-3). 3.3.5.5.7.  Do  not  sacrifice  basic  instrument  flying  when  performing  secondary  trail tasks  during  trail  departures.    Strictly  adhere  to  the  briefed  climb  speeds,  power settings,  altitudes,  headings,  and  turn  points.    First  priority  is  given  to  flying  the aircraft, not operating the radar or data link.  If task saturation occurs, cease attempts to  maintain  trail,  immediately  concentrate  on  flying  the  instrument  departure,  and notify the flight lead. 3.3.5.5.8.  No  Radar  Contact  Procedures.    When  an  aircrew  losses,  or  cannot  gain situational awareness on the preceding aircraft (or element) via air-to-air radar or data link information the following procedures apply. 3.3.5.5.8.1.  The flight  lead will call initiating all turns and descents  and  passing each 5,000 feet  altitude  increment with altitude  and heading  until  join-up, level-off or the non-“tied” aircraft calls “tied.” (T-3). 3.3.5.5.8.2.  During  climbs  and  descents,  the  aircraft  (element)  immediately preceding the aircraft that  is  not  “tied” will call  passing each 5,000  foot  altitude increment  with  altitude  and  heading  until  join-up,  level-off  or  the  following AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 25 aircraft  (element)  calls  “tied.”  (T-3).  In  addition,  the  aircraft  immediately preceding  the  aircraft  that  is  not  tied  will  call  initiating  any  altitude  or  heading change. (T-3).  Acknowledgments are not required. 3.3.5.6.  Enroute Procedures and Working Area Operations. 3.3.5.6.1.  Do  not  use  exaggerated  or  rolling  maneuvers  to  maintain  or  regain formation  position  below  5,000  ft.  AGL  or  in  airspace  where  aerobatics  are prohibited. 3.3.5.6.2.  In  Instrument  Meterological  Conditions  (IMC),  maximum  flight  size  in close formation is four aircraft except when flying in formation with a tanker.  Follow the guidance in NATO ATP-3.3.4.2 when flying in formation with a tanker. 3.3.5.6.3.  For  rejoins  from  tactical  formations,  the  wingman  will  join  to  the  side  of the formation occupied at the time the rejoin is directed. (T-3).  If in trail, join to the left  side.   In all cases, the trailing  element  will join to  the side opposite the number two, unless otherwise directed. (T-3). 3.3.5.6.4.  Loss of Visual.  If a flight member loses sight of his flight leader or other flight member at a time when he or she thinks they should be in sight, a "blind" call will  be  made.  (T-3).    Losing  and  regaining  sight  during  certain  types  of  tactical maneuvers these instances.When  any  flight  member  calls  "blind,"  the  other  flight  member  will immediately respond with "visual" and a position report. (T-3).  When the other flight member is also "blind", the flight leader will take action to ensure altitude separation between flight members. (T-3). thus  making  “blind”  calls  not  required is  expected, in 3.3.5.6.5.  Three and Four-Ship Formations (or more).  When flights of more than two aircraft are in tactical formation: 3.3.5.6.5.1.  Formation visual signals performed by a flight/element leader pertain only to the associated element unless specified otherwise by the flight leader. 3.3.5.6.5.2.  During low altitude operations trailing aircraft/element will maintain a sufficient distance back so that primary emphasis during formation maneuvering is  on  low  altitude  awareness  and  deconfliction  within  elements,  not  on deconfliction between elements. (T-3). 3.3.5.6.6.  Dissimilar Formation.  Aircrew members in dissimilar formations must be knowledgeable  of  the  procedures,  visual  references  and  limitations  of  the  other aircraft types in the formation as required by the mission. (T-3). 3.3.5.6.7.  Ops  Checks.    Increase  the  frequency  of  ops  checks  during  tactical maneuvering at high power settings.  Ops checks should include but aren’t limited to fuel status, instruments, engines, and life support systems. 3.3.5.7.  Position Changes. 3.3.5.7.1.  Day  Visual  Meterological  Conditions  (VMC).    The  minimum  altitude  for position  changes  within  a  formation  is  500  feet  AGL  over  land  or  1,000  feet  AGL over water, except for emergencies. 26 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 3.3.5.7.2.  Night  or  IMC.    The  minimum  altitude  for  position  changes  within  a formation is 1,500 feet AGL, unless established on radar downwind.  A radio call is mandatory when directing position changes at night or in IMC. 3.3.5.7.3.  Pilots will not initiate lead changes with the wingman further aft of normal fingertip, route, or greater than 30 degrees back from line abreast. (T-3). 3.3.5.8.  Formation Breakup.  Aircrews must thoroughly brief formation  breakup. (T-3).  Flight  leads  will  maintain  positive  control  and  when  necessary,  issue  instructions  to ensure safe separation of participating aircraft. (T-3). 3.3.5.8.1.  Flight  leaders  will  not  break  up  formations  until  each  pilot  has  a  positive fix from which to navigate (visual, ATC, inertial navigation system (INS), TACAN, VOR, or other suitable system waypoint). (T-3).   Formation break-up should  not be accomplished in IMC.  If unavoidable, IMC break-up is accomplished in straight and level  flight.    Prior  to  an  IMC  break-up,  the  flight  lead  will  confirm  position  and transmit  attitude,  altitude,  airspeed,  and  altimeter  setting.  (T-3).    Wingmen  will acknowledge and confirm good navigational aids. (T-3).  During formation breakups (under VMC or IMC), the flight lead will clear off aircraft and elements individually. (T-3).    Departing  aircraft  will  initially  turn  away  from  the  formation  and,  in  VMC conditions, establish visual contact with previously departing aircraft. (T-3). 3.3.5.8.2.  VMC drags on final below the weather are authorized if coordinated with ATC,  the  weather  is  at  least  1500  ft.  and  3  NM,  and  the  drag  is  accomplished  in sufficient  time  that  the  trail  formation  is  set,  and  all  aircraft  are  configured  for landing, prior to the final approach fix (FAF) (in the case of an instrument approach), or 3 NM from the landing point (in the case of a visual approach).  Minimum airspeed for any aircraft during the maneuver is final approach speed. 3.3.5.9.  Overhead Traffic Patterns. 3.3.5.9.1.  Overhead  patterns  can  be  made  with  unexpended  practice  ordnance  (e.g., BDU-33s) and live forward firing ordnance.  Overhead traffic patterns are prohibited with live or inert unexpended air-to-surface ordnance, unless that ordnance is secure and within an internal weapons bay. (T-3).  Normal spacing between overhead breaks is 5 seconds.  Aircraft should be wings level on final at approximately 300 feet AGL and 1 mile from the planned touchdown point. 3.3.5.9.2.  After landing clear aircraft to the exit side (cold side) of the runway when speed and conditions permit. 3.3.5.10.  Formation  Penetration  and  Approaches.    Formation  penetrations  are  restricted to  two aircraft when the weather at  the base of the intended approach or landing is  less than overhead traffic pattern minimums.  Aircrew must ensure ceiling and visibility are at least 500 feet and 1 1/2 miles. (T-3).  If flying a formation landing, the wingman should be  positioned  on  the  appropriate  wing  prior  to  weather  penetration.    Formation  low approaches  may  be  flown  with  dissimilar  aircraft.    Approach  airspeed  is  based  on  the higher  approach  speed  of  the  two  aircraft.    Minimum  altitude  for  formation  low approaches is 100 feet during the day and 300 feet at night. 3.3.5.11.  Formation Landings. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 27 3.3.5.11.1.  Normally  accomplish  formation  landings  from  a  precision  approach, when  available.    If  not  available,  the  rate  of  descent  should  be  similar  to  a  normal precision approach. 3.3.5.11.2.  Landing.  When briefing formation landings, flight leads will brief missed approach  and  go-around  procedures.  (T-3).    Wingmen  will  be  positioned  on  the upwind  side  of  the  formation  when  crosswinds  are  greater  than  5  knots.  (T-3).  Minimum wingtip clearance is 10 feet. 3.3.5.11.3.  Formation landings are restricted to elements of two like (same model and design)  aircraft.    Aircraft  must  be  symmetrically  configured  with  air-to-surface ordnance  and/or  fuel  tanks,  and  loaded  such  that  a  trim  or  control  application  to counter  a  heavy  wing  or  yaw  during  landing  is  not  required.  (T-3).    Aircrew  must ensure  the  runway  is  at  least  125  feet  wide  (140  feet  A-10).  (T-3).    Aircrews  must ensure ceiling and visibility are at least 500 feet and 1 1/2 miles. (T-3). 3.3.5.11.4.  Aircrews  will  not  conduct  formation  landings  if  any  of  the  following exist: (T-3). 3.3.5.11.4.1.  The  runway  is  reported  as  “wet”  and/or  measured  RCR  is  at  or below 18 (or ice, slush, or snow is on the runway). 3.3.5.11.4.2.  Effective crosswind component or crosswind gust exceeds 15 knots or flight manual limits, whichever is lower. 3.3.5.11.4.3.  Night conditions exist. 3.3.5.11.4.4.  Either aircraft has hung ordnance. 3.3.5.11.4.5.  Aircraft are loaded with live or inert munitions (excluding air-to-air missiles, or internal gun ammunition, or practice bombs). 3.3.5.11.4.6.  Arresting gear tape connectors extend onto the runway surface at the approach end of 125-feet-wide runways. 3.3.5.11.5.  Touch-and-go formation landings are prohibited. 3.3.5.11.6.  Pilots will maintain their respective landing side of the runway until both aircraft have decelerated to a safe taxi speed. (T-3). 3.3.5.12.  Trail Recovery.  Trail recoveries are authorized for air-to-air radar and data link equipped aircraft that are capable of using these systems for formation position keeping.  For all other aircraft, trail recoveries are authorized only if procedures are established in the applicable MD-specific attachments. 3.3.5.12.1.  ATC  approval  is  mandatory  to  fly  a  trail  recovery.    Flight  leads  must advise ATC of intentions to conduct non-standard formation. (T-2).  Flight leads must ensure  that  ATC  understands  that  instructions  to  the  lead  aircraft  are  for  the  entire flight, and ATC will provide radar flight following for the entire formation. (T-2). 3.3.5.12.2.  Trail recoveries are limited to a maximum of four aircraft.  Prior to taking spacing  the  flight  lead  will  ensure  the  requirements  for  formation  breakup  are accomplished.  (T-3).  Complete  any  formation  changes  to  effect  trail  recovery positions prior to the instrument approach FAF. 28 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 3.3.5.12.3.  Use  pre-briefed  airspeeds,  geometry,  radar,  radio  calls,  etc.  to  effect  the formation change and maintain flight members’ situational awareness.  Pilots will fly no slower than computed final approach speed to accomplish the spacing maneuver. (T-3).  Minimum spacing between flight members is 1 NM. 3.3.5.12.4.  If  radar  contact,  or  data  link  situational  awareness  is  lost  with  the preceding  aircraft,  the  pilot  will  transmit  "(Callsign)  lost  contact."  (T-3).    The preceding aircraft will respond with  altitude, airspeed and heading. (T-3).  Establish altitude deconfliction, if necessary, and coordinate a separate clearance with ATC.  If contact  is  lost  while  established  on  a  segment  of  a  published  approach,  flight members  may  continue  the  approach,  but  must  confirm  separation  via  navigation aids. (T-3).  If separation cannot be confirmed, execute missed approach or climb-out as instructed by ATC. 3.3.5.12.5.  Once  established  on  a  segment  of  a  published  approach,  each  aircraft must  comply  with  all  published  altitudes  and  restrictions  while  maintaining  in-trail separation. (T-2).  All aircraft must report the FAF. (T-2). 3.3.5.12.6.  Aircrews  will  not  terminate  trail  recoveries  in  simultaneous  Precision Approach  Radar  (PAR)  or  Airport  Surveillance  Radar  (ASR)  approaches.  (T-2).  Recoveries  to  separate  PAR/ASRs  are  authorized.  Flight  leads  will  coordinate  with ATC and split prior to PAR/ASR final. (T-2). 3.3.5.13.  Lost  Wingman  Procedures.    In  any  lost  wingman  situation,  immediate separation  of  aircraft  is  essential.  Smooth  application  of  control  inputs  is  imperative  to minimize  the  effects  of  spatial  disorientation.    Upon  losing  sight  of  the  leader,  the wingman  will  simultaneously  transition  to  instruments,  execute  the  applicable  lost wingman procedures, and inform  flight  lead. (T-2).  The flight  leader will  acknowledge the lost wingman's radio call and transmit attitude, heading, altitude, airspeed, and other parameters as appropriate (T-2). Permission to rejoin the flight must be obtained from the flight leader after lost wingman procedures have been executed. (T-2). 3.3.5.13.1.  Two or Three Ship Flights will follow the procedures outlined below (T-2) (Note: If in 3-ship echelon, refer to 4-ship lost wingman procedures): 3.3.5.13.1.1.  Wings-Level  Flight  (Climb,  Descent,  or Straight  and  Level).  Turn away using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds; then resume heading and obtain a separate clearance. 3.3.5.13.1.2.  Turns (Climb, Descent, or Level): 3.3.5.13.1.2.1.  Outside  the  Turn.    Reverse  the  direction  of  turn  using  15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds.  Continue straight ahead to ensure separation before resuming turn.  Obtain a separate clearance. 3.3.5.13.1.2.2.  Inside the Turn.  Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-to-tail clearance and inform the leader to roll out of the turn.  Maintain angle of bank to ensure lateral separation and obtain a separate clearance.  The leader may resume turn only when separation is ensured. 3.3.5.13.1.3.  Precision  and  Non-precision  Final  Approach.    The  wingman momentarily  turns  away  to  ensure  separation  and  informs  lead.    Commence  the AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 29 published  missed  approach  procedure  and  obtain  a  separate  clearance  from approach control. 3.3.5.13.1.4.  Missed Approach.  The wingman momentarily turns away to ensure clearance  and  informs  lead.    Continue  the  published  missed  approach  procedure and  climb  to  500  feet  above  missed  approach  altitude.    Obtain  a  separate clearance from approach control. 3.3.5.13.2.  Four  Ship  Flights.    The  number  two  and  three  aircraft  will  follow  the procedures  outlined  above.  (T-2).    Number  four  aircraft  will  follow  the  appropriate procedures listed below: (T-2). 3.3.5.13.2.1.  Wings-Level  Flight.    Turn  away  using  30  degrees  of  bank  for  30 seconds.  Resume heading and obtain a separate clearance. 3.3.5.13.2.2.  Turns: 3.3.5.13.2.2.1.  Outside The Turn.  Reverse the direction of the turn using 30 degrees  of    bank  for  30  seconds  to  ensure  separation  from  lead  and  number three aircraft.  Obtain a separate clearance. 3.3.5.13.2.2.2.  Inside  The  Turn.    Momentarily  reduce  power  to  ensure  nose-to-tail separation and increase bank angle by 15 degrees.  Inform the leader to roll out of the turn.  Obtain a separate  clearance. 3.3.5.14.  Severe  Weather  Penetration.    Avoid  flight  through  severe  weather.    If unavoidable,  flights  should  break-up  and  obtain  separate  clearances  prior  to  severe weather penetration. 3.3.6.  Targeting  Pod  (TGP)  Pilot.    MD-specific  guidance  is  provided  in  this  instruction’s attachments where required. 3.3.7.  Navigation Pod (Fighter Only).  MD-specific guidance is provided in this instruction’s attachments where required. 3.3.8.  Night  Vision  Goggle  (NVG).    Pilots  should  not  become  overly  confident  in  the capabilities of NVGs.  Many things can cause a pilot to lose outside visual references.  Some examples are entering the weather (intentionally or inadvertently), NVG battery failure, flight into smoke or dust, flight into a shadowed area, sudden illumination of an incompatible light source inside or outside of the cockpit, etc.  Pilots must ensure primary and secondary flight instruments  are  sufficiently  illuminated  to  allow  transition  to  instruments  if  outside  visual references are lost. (T-3). 3.3.8.1.  Aircrew must test and focus their NVGs preflight using (in order of preference) the  Hoffman  ANV-20/20  Tester,  a  unit  eye  lane,  or  equivalent  tester  prior  to  NVG operations. (T-3).  See AFI 11-301 Volume 1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program, for specific procedures. 3.3.8.2.  Use of NVGs during all takeoffs and landings are prohibited unless authorized in MD-specific attachments or required for an approved test plan event. 3.3.8.3.  NVGs  will  only  be  worn  in-flight  by  NVG  qualified  aircrew  or  by  upgrading aircrew  under  the  supervision  of  a  qualified  NVG  Instructor.  (T-2).    Familiarization 30 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 flights are authorized under the supervision of an NVG IP if appropriate ground training has been accomplished. 3.3.8.4.  (N/A  helicopter  or  tilt-rotor.)  NVGs are donned above the MSA and in level to  climbing  flight  when  possible.    Remove  NVGs  a  minimum  of  5  minutes  prior  to landing,  while  above  the  MSA  when  possible,  to  allow  enough  time  to  regain  adequate visual acuity to perform the approach and landing. 3.3.8.5.  While  conducting  NVG  formation  procedures,  the  flight  lead  will  brief  when each flight member dons/doffs their NVGs. (T-3).  In single seat aircraft, only one flight member at a time will don NVGs; other flight members monitor the member if able. (T-3).  In multi-seat aircraft, only one crew member at a time will don NVGs; another crew member monitors aircraft parameters if able. (T-3).  A “goggles on” or “goggles off” call will be made indicating the status of the aircrew in each aircraft. (T-3).  Wingman will fly no closer than route position while wearing NVGs. (T-3). 3.3.8.6.  Aircrews will only use NVGs in VMC with a discernable horizon. (T-2).  Flight leads  or  aircraft  commanders  (as  appropriate)  must  brief  a  non-NVG  plan  to  execute  if flight conditions degrade. (T-2). 3.3.8.7.  (N/A  C-130,  C-17,  helicopters  and   See  MD-specific attachments.)  The  minimum  altitude,  when  flying  below  the  MSA  and  using  only NVGs  to  clear  terrain  and  obstacles,  is  1,000  feet  AGL.    Flight  below  the  MSA,  while using  NVGs  only,  requires  high  illumination  conditions  as  defined  by  AFI  11-214,  Air Operations  Rules  and  Procedures.    If  another  system,  such  as  TF/TA,  is  used  to  clear terrain and obstacles the minimum altitude is defined by that system’s capability. tilt-rotor. 3.3.8.8.  (N/A  H-1.    See  MD-specific  attachment.)  Fly  with  NVGs only  in  production NVG  compatible  cockpits,  or  with  a  system  described  in  the  aircraft  MFM,  or  as stipulated in an approved test plan.  Aircrew must ensure that all control and performance instruments  are  sufficiently  illuminated  by  an  NVG  compatible  light  source.  (T-3).  Aircrew must ensure lighting provides for immediate reference in the event they need to transition to instruments with loss of visual references. (T-2). 3.3.8.9.  Aircrews will suppress all NVG incompatible interior light sources so that they do not degrade the aircrew’s ability to see outside of the cockpit with NVGs. (T-3).  If an incompatible  light  source  cannot  be  suppressed,  pilots  will  terminate  NVG  operations. (T-3). 3.3.8.10.  During  in-flight  emergencies,  NVGs  may  be  retained  unless  they  become  a detriment  to  safely  recovering  the  aircraft.    In  ejection  seat  equipped  aircraft,  aircrews will  remove  and  stow  NVGs  as  soon  as  an  emergency  begins  to  deteriorate  into  an ejection situation. (T-2). 3.3.9.  Helmet-Mounted  Cueing  System  Guidance  (HMCS).    MD-specific  guidance  is provided in this instruction’s attachments where required. 3.3.10.  High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) Targeting System (HTS).  MD-specific guidance is provided in this instruction’s attachments where required. 3.4.  Air-to-Air Operations.  This section applies to Intercept, Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM), Low Altitude Training (LOWAT), and Air Combat Training (ACBT).  ACBT includes both Air AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 31 Combat Maneuvering (ACM) and Air Combat Tactics (ACT).  AFMC invokes AFI 11-214 Air-to-Air  training  rules  for  air-to-air  training  missions  with  the  additional  restrictions  detailed below.  Developmental air-to-air testing is conducted in accordance with test and safety review board guidance and may include AFI 11-214 training rules as appropriate. 3.4.1.  Air-to-Air  (A/A)  Maneuvering  restrictions.    Intercept  qualified  aircrew  may  conduct intercepts  in  accordance  with  limited  maneuvering  training  rules.    If  both  aircrews  are intercept  and  BFM  qualified,  1v1  intercepts  to  unlimited  maneuvering  are  permissible.  Unlimited maneuvering, on sorties greater than 1 V 1 (e.g., 2 V 1, 2 V 2), requires an ACBT qualification.  Flights may consist of ACBT and Intercept qualified crews; however, Intercept qualified crews will adhere to limited maneuvering restrictions IAW AFI 11-214. 3.4.1.1.  Maximum  sortie  size  and  engagement  size.    Maximum  sortie  size  is  4  V  4  for unlimted  or  limited  maneuvering.    Maximum  visual  engagement  size  is  4  aircraft.    The OG/CC may approve participation in larger exercises on a case by case basis.  Non-radar equipped aircraft are restricted to limited maneuvering in visual engagements larger than 2 V 1. 3.4.1.2.  Aircrews will not conduct negative G gun jinks. (T-2). 3.4.2.  Air-to-Air  System  Checks.    Wingmen  may  complete  their  A/A  system  check  during formation  rejoins.    Flight  leads  should  strive  to  conduct  A/A  system  checks  within  special use airspace. or above 10,000 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). 3.4.3.  Separation of Aircraft.  Aircrews will not maneuver within 1,000 feet of an opposing aircraft during air-to-air engagements. (T-2). 3.4.4.  Simulated  Gun  Employment.    To  prevent  inadvertent  firings  when  simulating  gun employment,  ensure there is  no  ammunition  loaded or safe the  gun according to  –34 series T.O.s,  and  comply  with  AFTTP  3-3.MDS  specific  attachment  guidance  or  AFI  11-2MDS Volume 3 guidance. (T-2).  Perform a trigger  check (trigger squeeze) before simulated gun employment. 3.4.5.  Battle Damage/Bomb Checks.  Unless circumstances prevent, flight leads will direct a battle  damage/bomb  check  prior  to  or  during  return  to  base  (RTB).  (T-3).    Battle  damage checks for test missions will be determined by the SRB Chair. (T-3).  Formation spacing is no closer than normal fingertip.  Battle damage checks are not required during night or IMC, however they may be accomplished at night if wearing NVGs. 3.5.  Air-to-Surface Weapons Delivery, Air Drop and/or Low Altitude. 3.5.1.  Air-to-Surface Weapons Delivery.  This section describes procedures for aircrew air-to-surface  operations  and  is  applicable  to  all  AFMC  aircraft.    Weapons  delivery  operations are  IAW  AFI  13-212,  Volume  1,  Range  Planning  and  Operations,  T.O.  1M-34,  Aircraft Weapons Delivery Manual, and aircraft specific -34 T.O.s.  Helicopter weapons employment techniques and procedures are discussed in 3-1 and 3-3 MDS volumes; there are no -34 T.O.s for these aircraft.  AFMC invokes AFI 11-214 Air-to-Surface training rules for air-to-surface training  missions  with  the  additional  restrictions  detailed  below.    Developmental  air-to-surface  testing  is  conducted  in  accordance  with  test  and  safety  review  board  guidance  and may include AFI 11-214 training rules as appropriate.  Unless otherwise specified, all limits 32 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 for tilt-rotor aircraft in airplane (APLN) mode equal those cited for fixed wing aircraft.  Tilt-rotor aircraft operating in CONV or VTOL mode are equal to those cited for helicopters. 3.5.1.1.  Weapons  Delivery  Target  Identification.    Aircrew  must  positively  identify  the target  and  ensure  correlation  with  the  targeting  system  prior  to  weapons  release.  (T-2).  For example, a pilot may visually identify a target, but must ensure the sensor controlling the  point  of  impact  (targeting  pod,  radar,  etc)  will  direct  the  weapon  to  the  identified target.    When  delivering  weapons  via  an  INS  and/or  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS) solution  (through  an  undercast,  in  IMC,  at  night,  etc)    target  identification,  and correlation is defined as verifying the target coordinates and navigation solution validity respectively, while airborne. 3.5.1.2.  Weather Minimums.  In accordance with the applicable range rules. 3.5.1.3.  Single Ship Operations.  AFMC aircrew, qualified in air-to-ground employment, may fly single ship weapon employment missions IAW AFI 11-214. 3.5.1.4.  Minimum  Altitudes.    Minimum  release  altitudes  are  specified  in  AFI  11-214.  Recovery  altitudes and planned dive  angles are specified in  Table  3.2  and AFI  11-214.  Contact AFMC/A3V for guidance if a conflict exists. Table 3.2.  Weapons Employment Minimum Recovery Altitudes.

Flight  Composition.    Dissimilar  aircraft  may  execute  deliveries  on  the  same range provided the delivery events are compatible with each type of aircraft and AFI 11-214 delivery spacing restrictions are followed. 3.5.1.6.  Live  Ordnance  Procedures.  Aircrews  will  comply  with  the  following  live ordnance procedures. (T-2). 3.5.1.6.1.  Conduct a thorough and complete verification of all target data. 3.5.1.6.2.  No release system, indicator, or weapon bay door malfunction may exist. 3.5.1.6.3.  Do  not  Weapon  Unlock/Release  Enable/Master  Arm  to  Arm    until  the aircraft is within the designated bombing range. 3.5.1.6.4.  If  all  weapons  are  expended  and  release  is  verified  visually  (pilot observation of impact, by the Range Control Officer (RCO), or other flight members) and  internal  indications  are  consistent  with  outside  observations,  aircrews  may conduct additional training without restriction. 3.5.1.6.5.  Do  not  make  simulated  weapon  delivery  passes  on  targets  occupied  by personnel. 3.5.1.7.  Class B/C Ranges.  When Ground Controllers are operating on Class B/C ranges aircrew will comply with the following procedures: (T-2). 3.5.1.7.1.  All pilots are familiar with applicable range weapons delivery procedures, appropriate targets and weapons footprints. 3.5.1.7.2.  Ground personnel locations are briefed and acknowledged by all pilots. 3.5.1.7.3.  Do not expend ordnance if any doubt exists as to the ground personnel or intended target locations. 3.5.1.8.  Battle  Damage/Bomb  Checks  (Fighter/Attack/Trainer).    Unless  circumstances prevent, flight leads will direct a battle damage/bomb check prior to or during recovery to base.  (T-3).    Battle  Damage  checks  for  test  missions  will  be  determined  by  the  SRB Chair.  (T-3).    Formation  spacing  is  no  closer  than  normal  fingertip.    Battle  damage checks are not required during night or IMC, however they may be accomplished at night if wearing NVGs. 3.5.1.9.  Armament System Malfunctions.  Aircrew will not attempt to expend ordnance using  a  delivery  system  with  a  known  weapons  release  malfunction  unless  following hung ordnance procedures. (T-2). 3.5.1.10.  Inadvertent  Release.    Record  switch  positions  and  impact  point  (if  known)  at the  time  of  inadvertent  release  and  provide  to  armament  and  safety  personnel.    Check armament switches safe and do not attempt further release in any mode.  Treat remaining stores as hung ordnance and obtain a chase aircraft during RTB, if practical.  If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison in a suitable area on a single pass, if practical. 3.5.1.11.  Hung  Ordnance.    Note  weapons  switch  settings  and  then  safe  the  armament system.  Crews experiencing a hung store may contact the RCO for permission to release or  jettison  the  hung  stores  in  a  suitable  area.    If  a  hung  store  cannot  be  jettisoned  or released,  or  if  the  crew  elects  not  to  jettison,  the  crew  will  accomplish  any  required 34 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 checklists  and  recover  to  the  most  appropriate  airfield  while  avoiding  over-flight  of populated  areas.  (T-2).    If  practical,  obtain  a  chase  and  have  the  aircraft  visually inspected.    Refer  to  local  guidance  for  recovery  procedures  with  hung  weapons.    Air refueling may be accomplished for safe recovery of the aircraft.  Land from a straight in approach.    If  the  situation  requires  a  landing  at  an  airfield  other  than  the  base  of operations with hung or unexpended weapons, advise the local authorities of the situation so that proper coordination can be accomplished with their safety office. 3.5.1.12.  Hang Fire/Misfire - General. 3.5.1.12.1.  A  missile  that  fires  but  fails  to  depart  the  aircraft  is  a  hangfire.    If  this occurs,  the  chase  pilot  (if  available)  should  closely  observe  and  safety  check  the missile.    Follow  the  hung  ordnance  recovery  procedures  in  accordance  with  local guidance. 3.5.1.12.2.  A missile that fails to fire when all appropriate switches were selected is a misfire.    If  this  occurs,  safe  the  Master  Arm  switch  and  follow  the  hung  ordnance recovery procedures. 3.5.1.13.  On-Range NORDO Procedures. 3.5.1.13.1.  Attempt contact with the RCO on the appropriate back-up frequency.  If unable to establish contact, make a pass by the range control tower (over the target if flying on an unmanned range) on the attack heading while rocking wings, and turn in the  direction  of  traffic.    The  flight  leader  will  either  rejoin  the  flight  and  RTB,  or direct another flight member to escort the NORDO to a recovery base. (T-3). 3.5.1.13.2.  If the NORDO aircraft has an emergency, and conditions permit, make a pass  by  the  range  control  tower,  on  the  attack  heading  while  rocking  wings,  turn opposite the direction of traffic, and proceed to a suitable recovery base.  The flight leader will direct a flight member to join-up and escort the emergency aircraft. (T-3). 3.5.1.13.3.  Unexpended  Ordnance.    If  radio  failure  occurs  and  circumstances preclude  landing  with  unexpended  ordnance,  accomplish  a  safe  jettison  of  the ordnance.  The NORDO aircraft should join on another flight member that has radio contact with the RCO and the remainder of the flight if possible.  Relay visual signals specified  in  AFI  11-205,  Aircraft  Cockpit  and  Formation  Flight  Signals  to  the NORDO aircraft to initiate stores jettison. 3.5.2.  Air  Drop  Operations.    Units  conducting  aerial  delivery  operations  will  develop specialized training programs and operational procedures. (T-2).  Units will employ AFI 11-301V2, Maintenance and Configuration Requirements for Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE), AFI  13-210,  Joint  Airdrop  Inspection  Records,  Malfunction/Incidents,  Investigations,  and Activity Reporting, AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Aviation  Badges,  FM  31-19,  Military  Free-Fall  Parachuting  Tactics,  Techniques,  and Procedures (US Army), and applicable T.O.s for all operations. (T-2).  Refer to MD-specific attachment and or other MAJCOM instructions for guidance. 3.5.2.1.  Units  will  conduct  airdrops  in  VMC.  (T-2).    IMC  airdrops  are  permitted  if aircraft is equipped with approved software/hardware and aircrew properly trained in its operation.    Comply  with  airspace  and  drop  zone  (DZ)  restrictions  for  blind  DZ AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 35 operations.  For detailed information on DZ sizes, markings, types, and weather and wind limits, refer to AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations.  For information on  aerial  delivery  airspeeds  and  altitudes,  refer  to  AFI  11-231,  Computed  Air  Release Point Procedures. 3.5.2.2.  Jumpmaster  directed  personnel  airdrops  require  OG/CC  approval  (not  required for helicopter or C-12).  The OG/CC can approve these airdrops on a case-by-case basis, or  may  approve  multiple  airdrops  from  a  test  plan  or  support  mission  program.  Document  with  a  memorandum  for  record.    If  approved,  the  user  accepts  all responsibility for airdrop accuracy and damage to equipment or injury to personnel. 3.5.2.3.  Approved computer-aided computed air release point (CARP) and high-altitude release point (HARP) programs may be used, but units must ensure results are verified. (T-2).   Units must check/verify the following information:  DZ impact  coordinates; load information to include number and parachute type, load weights, sequence of extraction, and load position. (T-2). 3.5.2.4.  Crews  will  not  conduct  airdrops  using  parachutes  unless  they  are  Service Approved,  MAJCOM  approved  (including  AFMC,  AMC  and  AFSOC)  or  AFI  11-231 approved.  (T-2).    This  does  not  apply  to  formal  test  missions  where  the  purpose  of  the test is to derive ballistic data for a specific load. 3.5.2.5.  The primary aircrew will review the DZ survey during mission planning. (T-3). 3.5.2.6.  Units  must  ensure  ADD  Form  1748,  Joint  Airdrop  Inspection  Report,  is accomplished  prior  to  all  equipment  airdrops.  (T-2).    Completion,  retention,  and disposition of the form is in accordance with AFI 13-210 and the AF Records Disposition Schedule.  Exception: A-71 and A-21 containers rigged for door bundles. 3.5.2.7.  Radio transmissions with the DZ are limited to those required for safety of flight considerations.  This includes ATC directions, range clearance, unsafe surface conditions, or  mission  changes.   Aircrew  will  coordinate  radio  silence/no  communications procedures prior to mission execution. (T-2). 3.5.2.8.  Drop  clearance  is  normally  inherent  with  mission  clearance  to  unmanned  DZs.  The  aircrew  observing  the  proper  briefed  authentication  confirms  drop  clearance  in VMC.    Drop  clearance  is  confirmed  via  radio  call  or  beacon  acquisition  in  IMC.  Absence  of  the  pre-briefed  marking,  jumbled  block  letter,  the  letter  X,  or  red light/smoke/flare is considered a no-drop call. 3.5.2.9.  No-Drop Decisions (automated airdrops). 3.5.2.9.1.  Prior  to  the  1-or  2-minute  warning,  notify  the  AC  when  any  condition exists that could jeopardize a safe drop. 3.5.2.9.2.  After the 1- or 2-minute warning, any crewmember observing a condition that would jeopardize a safe drop will transmit “NO DROP” on the interphone. (T-3). 3.5.2.9.3.  A  “NO  DROP”  is  called  if  checklists  items  required  prior  to  the  10/5 second call have not been completed. 3.5.2.9.4.  The non-flying pilot, the navigator/CSO (if applicable) and the loadmaster will  acknowledge  the  “NO  DROP”  call.  (T-2).    All  applicable  aircrew  will 36 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 immediately configure any automatic airdrop switches to prevent automatic release of the load. (T-2).  The AC will immediately instruct the crew to follow the appropriate procedures. (T-2). 3.5.3.  Low-Level Navigation Operations.  AFMC invokes AFI 11-214 Low Altitude training rules for low altitude missions with the additional restrictions detailed below. 3.5.3.1.  Low-Level  Environment  (N/A  V-22.    See  MD-specific  attachment).    Between sunrise  and  sunset,  the  low-level  environment  defined  by  this  instruction  is  at  or  below 2000 feet AGL for fixed wing aircraft and at or below 300 feet AGL for helicopters.  For IMC or night operations the low-level environment is defined as below the MSA. 3.5.3.2.  Minimum Altitudes. (N/A C-130 and C-17.  See MD-specific attachments). 3.5.3.2.1.  Day  VMC  (N/A  V-22.    See  MD-specific  attachment).    Fixed  wing  pilots will not conduct low-level flight below 500 ft AGL unless current and qualified (or in an approved training program) in Low Altitude Step Down Training (LASDT). (T-2).  Helicopter  pilots  may  conduct  low-level  flight  down  to  100  ft  AGL,  and  with  Ops Officer  approval,  minimums  altitudes  may  be  reduced  to  50  feet  above  the  highest obstacle  (AHO)  when  training  or  testing  necessities  exist.  (T-2).    Limit  time  below 100  ft  AGL  to  the  minimum  required  for  mission  objectives.    These  altitude restrictions do not apply to flight test techniques, such as tower flybys, performed in approved airspace, or FCF missions. 3.5.3.2.2.  Night  and IMC.  Aircraft will not fly  lower than the MSA (or ESA when operating in SUA vice a MTR) unless using an approved TF, TA, or other system. (T-2).    The  pilots  must  be  qualified  in  the  system  used,    and  the  system  must  be  fully operative. (T-2). 3.5.3.2.3.  Night VMC (N/A helicopter and tilt-rotor.  See MD-specific attachments).  Pilots  using  NVGs  can  fly  lower  than  the  MSA  (or  ESA  when  operating  in  a  SUA vice  a  MTR)    in  VMC  conditions  under  high  illumination  conditions  as  defined  in AFI  11-214  .    The  aircrew  must  be  current  and  qualified  in  below  MSA  NVG operations,  or  in  the  upgrade  program  and  under  the  supervision  of  an  IP  per  the training  program.  (T-2).    Also,  the  aircraft  must  have  an  operable  radar  altimeter unless executing a test plan. (T-2).  During NVG low-level operations, set the altitude warning to the minimum altitude planned during the low-level route. 3.5.3.3.  Visual Procedures. Weather minimums for visual low-level operations are 1,500 feet  (1000  for  helicopters  and  tilt-rotor  aircraft  in  CONV/VTOL  mode)  ceiling  and  3 miles visibility for any route or area, or as specified in FLIP for MTRs, unit regulations or national rules, whichever is higher. 3.5.3.3.1.  At altitudes below 1,000 feet AGL, wingmen will not fly at a lower AGL altitude than lead. (T-2). 3.5.3.3.2.  When  crossing  ridges,  high  or  hilly  terrain,  maintain  positive  G  on  the aircraft and do not exceed 120 (60 for helicopters) degrees of bank.  Maneuvering at less than 1 G is limited to upright (less than 90 degrees of bank) bunting maneuvers. 3.5.3.3.3.  If  unable  to  visually  acquire  or  ensure  lateral  separation  from  known vertical obstructions which are a factor to the route of flight, flight leads will direct a AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 37 climb  no  later  than  3  NM  (1  NM  for  helicopters  and  tilt-rotor  aircraft  in CONV/VTOL  mode)  prior  to  the  obstacle  to  an  altitude  that  ensures  vertical separation. (T-2). 3.5.3.3.4.  Military  Training  Route  (MTR)  Transition.    Use  radar  services  and  on-board  radar  systems  to  the  maximum  extent  practical  to  assist  with  visual  look-out. Unless  a  faster  minimum  safe  maneuvering  speed  is  mandated  by  the  aircraft  T.O., delay  acceleration  to  airspeeds  authorized  in  FLIP  until  established  inside  the confines of the MTR and decelerate back to  low altitude cruise speed prior to  route exit. If an unplanned route exit occurs (e.g. route abort, Terrain Flowing Radar (TFR) fly-up,  etc.),  slow  to  low  altitude  cruise  speed  after  terrain  or  obstacle  clearance  is assured.    Avoid  Class  A/B/C/D  airspace.    Limit  time  in  Federal  Airways  to  that required to cross them. 3.5.4.  Low Altitude Step Down Training (LASDT) Operations (N/A C-130, C-17, V-22, and helicopters.  See MD-specific attachments).  LASDT applies to fixed wing operations below 500  feet  AGL,  except  for  takeoff,  landing,  and  weapons  delivery  minimum  recovery altitudes.  LASDT fixed wing aircrew will not fly lower than 200 feet AGL during training nor  fly  lower  than  100  feet  AGL  during  test  unless  approved  by  the  safety  and  test  review boards.  (T-2).    MD-specific  guidance  is  provided  in  this  instruction’s  attachments  if necessary. 3.5.5.  Terrain  Following/Terrain  Avoidance  (TF/TA).    TF/TA  operations  are  prohibited unless  the  crew  is  current  and  qualified,  or  enrolled  in  an  applicable  training  plan.  Exception:  Aircrew  may  operate  TF/TA  in  Day  VMC  conditions  if  not  current.  Alternatively, qualified FCF/ACF/Operational Check Flight (OCF) aircrew may conduct day VMC  TF/TA  operations  in  accordance  with  T.O.  -6  procedures.    Conduct  TF  operations specified in an approved test plan within the guidelines of the test plan and any restrictions imposed  by  the  safety  review  board.    Annotate  low-level  charts  with  TF  Start/Termination areas.    Minimum  altitude  for  TF/TA  operations  is  no  lower  than  aircrew  qualification  for Low-level Navigation or LASDT or as approved in a safety/test plan. 3.5.5.1.  Negative  Altitude  Variations  on  IR  routes.    Excessive  negative  altitude variations  do  not  ensure  safe  terrain  clearance  at  your  MSA.    Aircrew  will  use  altitude variations  from  Pilot  to  Metro  Service  (PMSV)  (or  compute  using  PMSV  altimeter settings  and  D  values)  to  determine  which  route  segments  are  affected  by  excessive altitude variations. (T-2).  This information should be obtained as close as possible to the planned  entry  time.    Crews  unable  to  contact  a  PMSV  station  may  enter  using information from the preflight weather briefing. 3.5.5.1.1.  NVGs  may  be  used  to  clear  terrain  visually  during  night  VMC.    TF equipped  aircraft  may  continue  to  TF  in  an  area  of  excessive  negative  altitude variation.  However, in the event of a fly-up, TF malfunction, or any required climb to  MSA,  you  must  abort  the  route.  (T-3).    If  any  of  the  following  situations  occur during IMC or at night and the crew is unable to clear terrain visually, abort the route: 3.5.5.1.1.1.  The  difference  between  aircraft  system  altitude  and  the  Mean  Sea level (MSL) altitude as indicated with the most current altimeter setting exceeds -400  feet.    This  can  be  measured  directly  by  taking  an  altitude  calibration  (for example,  a  2420  MSL  pressure  altimeter  reading  and  a  2000ft  system  (true) 38 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 altitude would yield a -420 ft. altitude variation). 3.5.5.1.1.2.  The  aircraft  radar  altimeter  indicates  less  than  a  600  ft.  terrain clearance while at the MSA. 3.5.5.1.1.3.  Flying  and  maintaining  TF  clearance  plane  settings  and  the  aircraft pressure altimeters indicate at or above the route MSA. 3.5.5.2.  Crews  may  enter  the  route  in  IMC  conditions  and  fly  MSA  up  to  the  area  of excessive  altitude  variation.    Prior  to  entering  the  area  of  excessive  altitude  variation, crews  must  be  able  to  visually  clear  terrain  or  fly  TF,  in  order  to  continue  low-level operations.  (T-2).    Once  the  forecast/observed  area(s)  of  excessive  altitude  variation  is over-flown, subsequent portions of the low-level route may be flown. 3.6.  Flight Test Mission Operations. 3.6.1.  Flight Test Orientation.  For specific guidance see the MD-specific attachments. 3.6.2.  Aircrew engaged in flight test or test support in single pilot aircraft (except for the U-2 and RPA) will observe the following sortie duration limits: a maximum of 3.0 hours of test time  (beginning  at  start  of  first  test  point  and  running  continuously  until  3.0  hours  have expired), and a maximum scheduled sortie duration of 4.5 hours (including transit time). (T-3).    The  primary  test  unit  is  responsible  for  coordinating  with  the  supporting  unit commanders  when  other  test/test  support  assets  are  used.    Unit  commanders  must  consider aircrew experience, time of day, complexity, and the impact of delays in their decision. 3.6.3.  Target.  In the absence of test or safety review board restrictions follow the guidance in this instruction’s paragraph 3.4 Air-to-Air Operations. 3.6.4.  Chase.    This  section  describes  general  procedures  for  planning,  briefing  and  flying chase formations.  This guidance is not intended for test support aircraft being employed in a “target” role. 3.6.4.1.  General.    In  addition  to  specific  flight  test  requirements,  the  test  aircrew  are often concentrating on items not generally associated with normal formation operations.  The  chase  aircrew  must  be  aware  of  the  test  point  requirements,  monitor  parameters, ensure  safe  separation  and  clear  for  the  formation.    To  optimize  the  contribution  chase assets  provide,  test  aircrew  will  brief  specific  chase  procedures  for  each  test  point  to include  description  of  the  test  maneuver,  expected  chase  position,  expected  parameters, expected radio calls, and rejoin procedures. (T-3). 3.6.4.2.  Types of Chase.  The test team will clearly brief the chase crew’s objectives in accordance with test and safety review board stipulations. (T-3).  Flight leads will cover chase  aircrew  positions  and  responsibilities  during  the  flight  briefing.  (T-3).    The  flight lead will direct chase positions in flight as required by test objectives. (T-3). 3.6.4.2.1.  Safety  Chase.    Visual  formation  that  maximizes  the  briefed  chase  duties.  Chase  duties  include  but  are  not  limited  to  deconfliction,  clearing,  observing  test point  execution,  monitoring  altitudes,  airspeeds,  limits  and  other  flight  parameters and periodic checks of aircraft and store condition. 3.6.4.2.2.  Area  Chase.    The  chase  aircraft  need  only  remain  in  the  designated  test area and maintain radio contact with the test aircraft.  The chase pilot should maintain AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 39 situation  awareness  of  the  test  aircraft’s  location  via  use  of  data  link  information, radar, air-to-air TACAN, and/or ground controllers, as required and should deconflict his  flight  path  from  all  other  airborne  elements  of  the  mission.    Area  chase  should remain in a position where an expeditious intercept to rejoin with the test aircraft can be accomplished, if required. 3.6.4.2.3.  Photo Chase.  Position is dictated by the photo requirements of the test and photographic  equipment.    Flight  planning  and  briefing  includes  formation  positions during various phases of flight or test points as well as radio terminology.  Pilot and photographer  must  discuss  camera  communications,  maneuvers  to  be  performed, disposition and stowage of photographic equipment in the event of emergency egress and ejection. (T-3).  Regardless, maintaining the briefed minimum safe distance from the test aircraft, test items, or the terrain remains a primary responsibility of the chase pilot. 3.6.4.2.4.  Instructor  Pilot/Standardization  Evaluation  Flight  Examiner  (IP/SEFE) Chase.    IP/SEFE  chase  is  close  formation  to  route  formation  so  as  to  evaluate maneuvering parameters.  Pilots will maintain in-flight nose-tail separation. (T-3). 3.6.4.3.  Requirements  and  Restrictions.    Any  pilot  may  chase  an  aircraft  under emergency  or  impending  emergency  conditions.    Pilots  who  have  completed  an Instrument/Qualification evaluation may chase as safety observer for aircraft performing simulated  instrument  flight  or  hung  ordnance  patterns.    Pilots  that  have  completed  the chase  upgrade  training  may  chase  test  events.    Only,  an  instructor  or  evaluator  may  fly IP/SEFE chase. 3.6.4.3.1.  Missions  Requiring  Chase  Support.    The  following  types  of  test  missions require  a  chase  aircraft,  unless  a  test  safety  review  board  specifically  assesses otherwise:  first  flights  on  new  aircraft;  performance  testing  of  new/modified  test aircraft,  stability  &  control  and/or  flying  qualities  evaluations  of  modified  or  new aircraft  configurations;  structural  integrity  tests;  dispensing,  separation,  functional and/or  jettison  tests  of  modified  or  new  munitions  (live  or  inert)  and  suspension equipment; captive compatibility flights (except baseline flights); and missions which prevent  the  test  aircrew  from  clearing  their  flight  path  in  “see  and  avoid”  airspace.  Chase  pilots  must  continue  to  fulfill  briefed  responsibilities  until  the  test  aircraft either lands or reverts to a non-chase required configuration or mission (for example, following release of a test weapon). (T-2). 3.6.4.3.2.  Briefing.    To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  briefings  between  chase  and test  aircrew  are  conducted  face-to-face.    Mission  briefings  at  a  minimum  include telephonic coordination with test aircrew.  Chase briefings specifically cover relevant test  hazards  and  risk  minimizing  procedures,  separation  of  aircraft,  minimum  and abort  altitudes,  chase  positions,  minimum  safe  distances  from  test  aircraft  and  test items,  control-room  and  flight  communication,  mission,  photo,  and  safety-related radio calls and terminology. 3.6.4.3.3.  Test/Chase  Aircraft  Configuration.    Chase  aircrew  should  assist  with preflight  of  the  test  aircraft  and  munitions  to  observe  and  become  familiar  with configurations, lanyards, panels, airframe scratches, etc..  This is not required where 40 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 there is no external test item and there is no additional risk of structural failures due to the flight test such as avionics or software tests. 3.6.4.3.4.  Communications.    Primary  test  and  chase  aircraft  maintain  radio  contact during the mission.  To maximum extent possible, the chase aircraft monitors Guard radio  frequency.    The  chase  pilot  will  issue  immediate  advisories  to  lead  if  lead deviates  significantly  from  intended  maneuvers  or  pre-briefed  flight  profile.  (T-2).  Chase will relay all “terminate,” “abort,” or “knock-it-off” calls. (T-3). 3.6.4.3.5.  Fuel.    Fuel  planning  should  account  for  test  mission  accomplishment  and contingencies.  When safety chase is required for recovery, fuel planning must permit chase  aircrew  to  chase  the  test  aircraft  to  a  full  stop  landing,  followed  by  another approach to a full stop by the chase aircraft. (T-3). 3.6.4.3.6.  Weather.    Weather  for  safety  chase  formation  is  a  discernable  horizon,  3 NM of visibility, and clear of clouds. 3.6.4.3.7.  Minimum  altitudes/airspeeds.    Excluding  airborne  pickups,  pattern  and landing chase, or unless specifically permitted by the technical/safety review boards, the chase minimum altitude is 500 ft. AGL.  The chase will not stack lower than lead when  operating  below  1,000  feet  AGL.  (T-3).    Exaggerated  rolling  or  vertical maneuvers below 5,000 ft. AGL are prohibited. 3.6.4.3.7.1.  Airborne Pickup.  When performing an airborne pickup chase will fly no slower than final turn / final approach speed and no lower than 200 feet AGL. (T-3).    This  procedure  may  be  modified  by  specific  test  mission  requirements  if approved by test and safety review boards. 3.6.4.3.7.2.  (N/A for helicopters and tilt-rotor.)  In the traffic pattern, IP/SEFE chase  aircraft  may  maneuver  as  necessary  to  observed  performance,  but  go  no lower than 50 feet AGL.  All other chase aircrew must initiate go around by 200 feet AGL, unless an emergency requires a lower altitude or specifically approved by  a  test  safety  review  board  to  support  test  requirements.  (T-3).    However,  50 feet AGL is an absolute minimum. 3.6.4.3.7.3.  Planned recovery and  abort altitudes and  g-loadings following dives are  based  on  available  aircraft  performance,  and  should  account  for  the  chase aircraft worst cast condition.  Normally, aircrew should plan on a wings-level 4g pull-out.    Higher  load  factors  may  be  flown,  if  within  aircraft  limits,  to  provide increased margins of safety. 3.6.4.3.7.4.  The  chase  pilot  must  be  able  to  fulfill  chase  responsibilities  while remaining at or above approach speed for the power approach configuration as a minimum. (T-2).  If the chase event requires a slower airspeed, a different type of chase  aircraft  should  be  selected  for  the  planned  test  maneuvers  or  a  solution based on geometry while maintaining chase approach speed or higher. 3.6.4.4.  Separation from Test Aircraft/ Air Vehicles/Munitions: test 3.6.4.4.1.  Manned  Aircraft:  fly  no  closer maneuvering unless performing briefed photo chase duties or “battle-damage”/“clean and dry” checks. than  route  formation  during AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 41 3.6.4.4.2.  RPA/SUAS:  fly  no  closer  than  the  test  and  safety  board  approved minimum distance. 3.6.4.4.3.  Munitions:    The  chase  aircrew  will  maneuver  and  position  themselves  so that if  the munition or store being tested separates unexpectedly no undue hazard is created. (T-2).  When chasing an item with an armed flight termination system, adjust maneuvers  and  position  to  avoid  the  associated  blast  and  fragmentation  zone  to  the maximum  extent  possible.    When  chasing  live  ordnance  missions,  the  chase  pilot must ensure safe separation in case of early fuse function, as well as safe escape. (T-2). 3.6.4.5.  Terminate test and chase events for any of the following: exceeding limits, loss of situation awareness, other air vehicles become a safety risk to the flight, a dangerous situation  is  developing,  radio  failure  is  recognized,  airspace  boundaries  are  violated,  or visual  contact  with  the  test  aircraft  is  lost  (area  chase  excepted).    Termination  of  a  test event  does  not  relieve  the  chase  aircraft  of  the  responsibility  to  deconflict  from  the  test aircraft and to provide see and avoid clearing.  If chase is unable to perform these duties due  to  loss  of  situational  awareness  or  malfunction,  chase  must  immediately  notify  the flight lead, test director, and other participating aircraft. (T-3). 3.6.4.6.  Cargo and Bomber Model Aircraft Restrictions. 3.6.4.6.1.  Cargo and bomber model aircraft may chase like aircraft (same MD) if the aircrew  are  visual  formation  trained.    In  this  case,  a  chase  qualification  is  not required.  At no time can the chase aircraft come within 200 feet of the test aircraft. 3.6.4.6.2.  Cargo  and  bomber  series  aircraft  may  chase  dissimilar  aircraft  (different MD) if the aircrew are chase qualified.  At no time can the chase aircraft come within 200 feet of the test aircraft.  Exception: See MD-specific attachment for C-12 chase minimum spacing. 3.6.5.  Ordnance  Release  Test.    All  weapons  delivery  guidance  applies.    Reference  MD-specific attachments for further guidance. 3.6.6.  Hi  Angle  of  Attack  (Hi  AoA).    Reference  MD-specific  attachments  for  further guidance. 3.6.7.  Compatibility  Flight  Profile  (CFP).    Fly  training  CFP  events  to  no  greater  than  90 percent  of  actual  aircraft  or  store  limits.    Reference  MD-specific  attachments  for  further guidance. 3.6.8.  Loads.    Fly  training  loads  profiles  to  no  greater  than  90  percent  of  actual  aircraft  or stores limits.  Reference MD-specific attachments for further guidance. 3.6.9.  Flutter.  Fly training flutter profiles to no greater than 90 percent of actual aircraft or stores limits.  Reference MD-specific attachments for further guidance. 3.6.10.  Airstart  (Single-Engine  Aircraft).    Reference  MD-specific  attachments  for  further guidance. 3.6.11.  Test Pilot School (TPS) Curriculum.  This section applies to qualifications for non-TPS assigned aircrew to instruct various TPS curriculum events in non-TPS assigned aircraft.  Examples include, but are not limited to, F-15 Asymmetry, C-130 performance evaluations, 42 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 and  systems  evaluations.    Guidance  is  provided  either  in  this  instruction’s  MD-specific attachments, or in the unit’s supplement to this instruction. 3.6.12.  Air-to-Air  Refueling  Tanker  Test.    Reference  MD-specific  attachments  for  further guidance. 3.6.13.  Airdrop Test.  Reference MD-specific attachments for further guidance. 3.6.14.  Qualitative Evaluations. 3.6.14.1.  Pilots  (operating  manned  and  RPAremotely  piloted  aircraft)  and  RPA  pilots (operating remotely piloted aircraft).  TPS students and graduates performing qualitative flying  evaluations  in  conjunction  with  a  TPS  syllabus,  TPS  curriculum  development, curriculum  exposure  or  short  term  qualitative  evaluations  may,  under  the  direct supervision  of  a  qualified  instructor  in  said  aircraft,  operate  the  aircraft  during  critical phases  of  flight.    This  paragraph  also  applies  to  experimental  test  RPA  students/pilots operating a manned surrogate RPA from a ground control station. 3.6.14.2.  Combat  Systems  Officer  (CSO)/RPA/Flight  Test  Engineer  (FTE)/non-TPS graduate  TPS  staff  instructors.    TPS  graduates  or  TPS  students  performing  syllabus events  (including  qualitative  evaluations)  or  non-TPS  graduate  TPS  staff  instructors performing  curriculum  mission  familiarization  or  development  flights  may,  under  the direct supervision of a qualified instructor in said aircraft, operate the aircraft during all non-critical phases of flight during day VMC.  They may also operate the aircraft from a non-mandatory pilot position for routine operational maneuvers  in the following critical phases of flight: Low-level at or above 500 feet AGL in flat and rolling terrain, 1000 feet in mountainous terrain (300 feet above highest obstacle helicopters), simulated weapons delivery  resulting  in  a  Time  Safety  Margin  (TSM)  of  no  less  than  8  seconds  and remaining  above  1000  feet  AGL,  and  simulated  instrument  or  VFR  approaches  above 150 feet AGL (100 feet AGL if final approach airspeed is less than 130 KCAS) provided deviations will not jeopardize a normal transition to landing.  Additionally, to transition below  500  feet  AGL  on  a  simulated  instrument  or  VFR  approach,  meet  stabilized approach criteria of minus 5 to plus 10 knots from approach speed and a vertical velocity of less than 1000 fpm.  Consider terrain mountainous that undergoes 3,000 feet elevation change in 10 NM. 3.6.14.2.1.  RPA pilots. TPS students  and graduate TPS staff members may  conduct relevant  Flight  Test  Techniques  (FTT)  during  these  limited  critical  phases  of  flight provided they are under the direct supervision of a USAF TPS staff IP. 3.6.15.  Time Safety Margin (TSM). 3.6.15.1.  For  test  points  involving  descents/dives  that  are  not  conducted  IAW  AFI  11-2FTV3,  AFTTP  3-  series  publications,  or  the  sections  of  AFI  11-214  invoked  by  this AFI, base recovery planning and risk management upon the calculated TSM. TSM is the time in seconds to directly travel from the worst case vector (i.e. worst case combination of parameters: dive angle, attitude, airspeed, and available G that includes both planned and  maximum  allowed  deviation/tolerance)  to  an  unrecoverable  condition.  Use  the following general planning factors and limits when calculating TSM. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 43 3.6.15.1.1.  The worst-case vector may occur at any point during the entire maneuver, from  the  FTT  setup  to  the  completion  of  the  recovery.  For  instance,  the  worst-case vector  may  be  during  FTT  setup  if  a  steep  dive  is  used  to  gain  airspeed  for  a  FTT conducted in a shallow dive. 3.6.15.1.2.  When  the  dive  is  becoming  steeper  at  the  dive  recovery  initiation  point, the  TSM  is  decreasing  faster  than  1  second  for  every  second  of  delay.  Test  teams must account for this additional risk element. 3.6.15.1.3.  Calculate abort/recovery procedures using no more than 90% of available aircraft limits and performance characteristics (i.e. roll rate) at the flight conditions or 90%  of  the  flight  clearance  authorized  G  loading,  whichever  is  less.    Additionally, minimize any combination of high-G, G dwell time, high-G onset, roll rate, and rapid transition from negative to positive G. 3.6.15.1.4.  Normal-G onset rate will be in accordance with aircraft capabilities at the test conditions. 3.6.15.1.5.  Brief  all  normal-G  levels,  roll  rates  and  other  assumptions  used  to calculate maneuver TSM to the technical and safety review boards. 3.6.15.1.6.  Use  the  procedures  outlined  in  Table  3.3  to  minimize  the  risk  of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) cognizant that the charted risk assessment is prior to mitigation. 3.6.15.1.7.  Regardless  of  the  TSM,  test  teams  must  be  alert  for  situations  that  may require additional risk mitigation. High G, poor visibility, pilot distraction on mission systems,  G-induced  loss  of  consciousness  (GLOC),  and  unanticipated  engine  and aerodynamic characteristics may make it impossible to perform the planned recovery. Table 3.3.  TSM Risk Assessment.

Anticipatory cueing provides a timeline to recovery, e.g. Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS) Heads-Up Display (HUD) “chevron” symbology or altitude countdown. 2. Brief the SRB on all available modeling and simulation (M&S) tools and which was used for TSM planning.  The SRB will validate both the dive planning M&S and the planned recovery procedure. 3. Calculate abort/recovery procedures using no more than 90% of available aircraft limits and performance characteristics (i.e. roll rate) at the flight conditions or 90% of the flight clearance authorized G loading, whichever is less.  Additionally, minimize any combination of high-G, G dwell time, high-G onset, roll rate, and rapid transition from negative to positive G. 4. Initiate recovery immediately after the test point is complete. 5. Document the planned and worst case allowable parameters, abort parameters and recovery procedure on flight test cards. 6. Accomplish initial in-flight buildup maneuvers with a minimum TSM of 8 seconds to validate predictions before proceeding to the test condition. 7. Simulator rehearsals will include practicing the complete recovery procedure. 8. Establish crew and critical test team member maneuver currency as part of the test and safety review process. 9. All available onboard altitude awareness devices will be briefed and used. To eliminate confusion as to what constitutes an “available” device, the test and safety planning process will define the minimum required onboard devices. 10. The recovery initiation back-up may be provided by an on-board safety crewmember, a chase aircrew, or control room personnel. 11. At least one of the two recovery initiation back-ups must be external to the test aircraft.  Anticipatory cueing may be used as one of the two pilot backups in the Redundantly Aided column. 12. The recovery cueing system must be fully qualified prior to flight then checked immediately prior to the maneuver. Human intervention to back-up the cueing system may not be considered risk mitigation for less than 1.5 seconds of TSM. An automatic recovery system may be used, but anticipatory cueing should still be provided. 13. Risk assessment should be based upon the anticipated effectiveness of the risk mitigation plan. With no risk mitigation aside from routine operations the risk assessment should not be less than that given in this row.  The mitigated TSM risk level is at the discretion of the SRB. 14. Without anticipatory cueing, CFIT is probable. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 45 Chapter 4 INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES 4.1.  Weather Requirements. 4.1.1.  All Fighter, Attack, Trainer or any other single pilot mandatory crew position aircraft may  fly  approaches  to  published  minimums  or  300  feet  and  1  mile,  whichever  is  higher.  Exception: UH-1, comply with  4.1.2. 4.1.2.  All  multi-pilot  mandatory  crew  position  aircraft  may  fly  approaches  to  published minimums unless limited by the MD-specific attachment or OG/CC. 4.2.  Approach Category.  Refer to MD-specific attachments for aircraft approach categories. 4.2.1.  Approach Category E Aircraft. 4.2.1.1.  Approach speeds equal to or greater than 166 knots, no matter the configuration or type of approach (i.e. straight-in, side-step, circling). 4.2.1.2.  Approach Category D minimums may be used when no Category E minimums are published, provided: 4.2.1.2.1.  A straight-in approach is flown. 4.2.1.2.2.  The aircraft is flown at a final approach airspeed of 165 KCAS or less. 4.2.1.2.3.  The aircraft is flown at 255 KTAS or less for the missed approach segment of the approach.  At high pressure altitudes and temperatures, 255 KTAS may not be compatible  with  published  missed  approach  airspeeds  and  Category  D  approaches should not be flown. 4.2.2.  Approach Category D Aircraft. 4.2.2.1.  Approach speeds of 141 knots to 165 knots. 4.2.2.2.  If  approach  speed  exceeds  165  knots,  no  matter  the  configuration  or  type  of approach (i.e. straight-in, side-step, circling), use the category E minimums. 4.2.2.3.  Approach Category C minimums may be used when no Category D minimums are published, provided: 4.2.2.3.1.  A straight-in approach is flown. 4.2.2.3.2.  The aircraft is flown at a final approach airspeed of 140 KCAS or less. 4.2.2.3.3.  The aircraft is flown at 240 KTAS or less for the missed approach segment of the approach.  At high pressure altitudes and temperatures, 240 KTAS may not be compatible  with  published  missed  approach  airspeeds  and  Category  C  approaches should not be flown. 4.2.3.  Approach Category C Aircraft. 4.2.3.1.  Approach speeds of 121 knots to 140 knots. 46 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 4.2.3.2.  If  approach  speed  exceeds  140  knots,  no  matter  the  configuration  or  type  of approach  (i.e.  straight-in,  side-step,  circling),  use  the  minimums  for  the  appropriate category. 4.2.4.  Approach Category B Aircraft. 4.2.4.1.  Approach speeds of 91 knots to 120 knots. 4.2.4.2.  If  approach  speed  exceeds  120  knots,  not  matter  the  configuration  or  type  of approach  (i.e.  straight-in,  side-step,  circling),  use  the  minimums  for  the  appropriate category. 4.2.5.  Approach Category A Aircraft. 4.2.5.1.  Approach speeds of 90 knots or less. 4.2.5.2.  If  approach  speed  exceeds  90  knots,  no  matter  the  configuration  or  type  of approach  (i.e.  straight-in,  side-step,  circling),  use  the  minimums  for  the  appropriate category. 4.3.  Weather Avoidance. 4.3.1.  Plan and fly all missions to avoid areas of known or forecast severe weather including severe icing or severe turbulence.  These restrictions do not apply to planned severe weather penetration as part of an approved test plan. 4.3.2.  During flight, attempt to avoid thunderstorms by at least the following unless further restricted in MD-specific attachments: 4.3.2.1.  20 NMs laterally at or above flight level (FL) 230. 4.3.2.2.  10 NMs laterally below FL 230. 4.3.2.3.  5 NMs for operations below 5000 feet. 4.3.2.4.  Avoid  gust  fronts  and  winds  preceding  a  rapidly  moving  thunderstorm.  Avoid areas of high lightning potential; i.e. clouds within plus or minus 5000 feet of the freezing level. 4.3.2.5.  Do  not  fly  directly  above  (within  2,000  feet)  thunderstorms  or  cumulonimbus clouds. 4.4.  Advisory  Calls  (N/A  C-130  and  helicopters.    See  MD-specific  attachments).    The following procedures are applicable to multi-place aircraft that do not have guidance defined in Technical  Orders.    Fighter-Trainers  are  considered  single-place  aircraft  and  exempt  from  these requirements. 4.4.1.  Advisory  Calls.    The  pilot  flying  will  periodically  announce  intentions  during departures,  arrivals,  approaches,  and  when  circumstances  require  deviating  from  normal procedures.  (T-3).    Mandatory  advisory  calls  are  provided  in  paragraphs  4.4.2  through  4.4.3.1. (The pilot not flying the aircraft will make these calls except those designated for any crewmember). (T-3). 4.4.2.  Altitude Calls, unless announced by an aircraft system. 4.4.2.1.  1,000 feet above Initial Approach Fix (IAF) (or holding) altitude. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 47 4.4.2.2.  Transition altitude/level. 4.4.2.3.  1,000 feet above or below assigned altitude. 4.4.2.4.  During  instrument  approaches  call  100  feet  above  procedure  turn,  FAF, minimum descent altitude (MDA), or Decision Height (DH) altitude. 4.4.2.5.  Non  Precision  Approaches.    The  pilot  not  flying  will  state  “MDA”  when reaching MDA and “Runway in Sight” when the runway environment is in sight. (T-3).  The  pilot  flying  will  state  intentions  (i.e.  “Continue”  or  “Land”)  and  continue  the approach below the MDA only if the aircraft is in a position to make a normal approach to the runway of intended landing and the pilot flying clearly sees the approach threshold of the runway,  approach lights,  or other markings identifiable with  the  approach  end of the runway. (T-3).  Otherwise, either pilot will state “Go Around” at the missed approach point (MAP) and the pilot flying will execute the appropriate missed approach procedure, ATC issued climbout instructions, or ATC clearance. (T-3). 4.4.2.6.  Precision Approaches.  The pilot not flying will state “DH” when reaching DH. (T-3).    At  DH  the  pilot  flying  will  state  intentions  (i.e.  “Continue”,  “Land”  or  “Go Around”).  (T-3).    The  pilot  flying  may  continue  the  approach  below  DH  only  if  the aircraft is in a position to make a normal approach to the runway of intended landing and the  pilot  flying  clearly  sees  the  approach  threshold  of  the  runway  ,  approach  lights,  or other  markings  identifiable  with  the  approach  end  of  the  runway.  Otherwise,  the  pilot flying  will  execute  the  appropriate  missed  approach  procedure,  ATC  issued  climbout instructions, or ATC clearance. (T-3). 4.4.3.  Deviations.  The pilot not flying the aircraft will tell the other pilot when heading or airspeed  deviations  are  observed  or  altitude  is  more  than  100  feet  from  desired  and  no attempt is being made to correct the deviation. (T-3). 4.4.3.1.  Any  crewmember  seeing  a  variation  of  200  feet  altitude,  a  deviation  of  +/-  10 knots  in  airspeed  or  a  potential  terrain  or  obstruction  problem  will  immediately  tell  the pilot.  (T-3).    Also  announce  deviations  from  prescribed  procedures  for  the  approach being flown. 4.5.  Instrument  Approach  Briefings/Checklists.  Aircrews  of  multi-place  aircraft  that  do  not have  guidance  defined  in  Technical  Orders  will  ensure  the  following  items  are  set  or  checked and briefed prior to the IAF: heading and attitude systems, navigation and communication radios, TACAN/VOR select switch, the final approach course and altimeters. (T-3).  In addition, review the  approach  and  the  aerodrome  sketch  and  brief  the  following  items:  sector  altitude,  DH  or MDA,  field  elevation,  weather  required  for  approach,  missed  approach  point,  climbout,  and intentions,  terrain/obstacle  hazards,  crew  duties  and  responsibilities,  lost  communication intentions, and backup approach and frequencies. 48 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 Chapter 5 OPERATING PROCEDURES AND RESTRICTIONS 5.1.  General.  These procedures do not supersede flight manual guidance. Refer to MD-specific attachments for additional aircraft specific operational limits and restrictions. 5.2.  Technical  Orders.  Aircrews will operate all aircraft IAW the applicable technical orders. (T-2).    In  the  case  where  technical  orders  do  not  yet  exist  personnel  will  not  operate  new equipment  or  modified  aircraft  without  properly  validated  and  verified  tech  data  in  accordance with  00-5  series  T.O.s.  (T-2).    Once  validated  by  flight  test,  new  equipment  can  be  operated using  test  cards  derived  from  an  approved  test  plan  if  other  tech  data  does  not  yet  exist.  Modified aircraft are operated in accordance with the aircraft modification flight manual. 5.3.  Developmental Software.  All software, including mission planning software, must be approved  IAW  the  USAF  Airworthiness  Process  prior  to  use  for  flight  outside  of  a  test program.  (T-2).  Under no circumstances can a flight outside of a test program take place with software that has not passed a safety of flight evaluation. 5.4.  New/Modified  Aircraft  Equipment/Weapons.  Aircrew  members  not  qualified  in  the operation  of  new  or  modified  aircraft  equipment  are  restricted  in  aircrew  duties.  They  will  not operate  that  equipment  on  any  flight  unless  under  the  supervision  of  a  current  and  qualified instructor of like specialty qualified in that equipment. (T-2).  This restriction does not apply to aircraft and aircrew under a formal test plan. 5.5.  Wind and Sea State Restrictions (Ejection Seat Aircraft).  Units will not conduct normal flying operations when surface winds along the intended route of flight exceed 35 knots steady state  or  when  the  sea  state  exceeds  10  feet  wave  height.  (T-3).    This  is  not  intended  to  restrict operations when only a small portion of the route is affected.  If possible, alter mission plan to avoid the area. 5.6.  Aerial  Demonstration/Show  Formation.  Refer  to  AFI  11-209,  Aerial  Event  Policy  and Procedures,  AFI  11-246,  Air  Force  Aircraft  Demonstrations,  and  applicable  MAJCOM directives for specific  rules and appropriate approval  levels  to  participate in  static displays and aerial events. 5.7.  Aerial Photography and Equipment  . 5.7.1.  Personnel  authorized  to  use  photographic  equipment.    Per  AFI  35-109,  Visual Information,  only  qualified  aerial  photographers  (Air  Force  Specialty  Code  3N0XX)  and contractor aerial photographers are authorized to  carry and operate photographic equipment in flight for mission related requirements.  Non-aerial photographer qualified personnel will not  carry  or  use  photographic  equipment  under  the  following  conditions:    when  flying  in ejection seat aircraft; when occupying a crew station with a set of flight controls. (T-3). 5.7.2.  Approved  equipment.    Aircrew  will  only  use  equipment  during  flight  that  meets  the requirements in AFI 11-202V3. 5.7.3.  Fighter/Trainer Aircraft.  Due to limited space and safety considerations, do not take more  than  two  camera  systems  on  board  the  aircraft.    A  mission  requiring  more  than  two cameras requires OG/CC approval.  Equipment size must be small enough to take out and/or AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 49 stow  quickly  without  interfering  with  flight  controls  or  throttles.  (T-3).    Keep  equipment stored  until  needed.    Remove  straps  and  lens  caps  before  departing  for  the  aircraft.    Cords must be coiled, not rigid. (T-3).  Inventory equipment before and after each mission.  Notify crew  chief  of  FOD,  if  applicable.    Do  not  lay  professional  gear  on  bare  consoles,  instead, place  gear  inside  helmet  bag.    Equipment  must  remain  clear  of  the  control  stick/yoke, throttles and any other cockpit controls or displays that are critical to flight safety. (T-3).  If time permits, store all gear prior to ejection. 5.8.  Aircrew flying g-suit capable aircraft must wear a g-suit. (T-2). 5.8.1.  Full Coverage Anti-G Suit (FCAGS) Aircrew are authorized to wear previously issued g-suits  for  all  sorties  until  the  FCAGS  is  personally  issued.  Once  personally  issued  an FCAGS,  the  FCAGS  becomes  the  primary  g-suit.    Aircrew  who  completed  F-15C/F-16 centrifuge  training  or  the  air-to-air  portions  of  an  F-15C/F-16  formal  training  course  (B-Course/TX/SOC) with the CSU-13B/P (legacy) g-suit may continue to use the legacy g-suit for sorties on which maximum load factor is planned to be 7g or less. Aircrew will wear the FCAGS when maximum load factor is planned (to include alternate missions) to exceed 7g. OG/FOA may stipulate further risk mitigations. (T-2) 5.9.  Preflight/Ground Operations. 5.9.1.  MA-1 Portable Oxygen Bottles. 5.9.1.1.  There  are  three  types  of  A-21  regulators  on  MA-1  portable  oxygen  bottles: unmodified,  modified,  and  modified2.    Except  for  fill  times,  operation  of  the  bottles  is identical.  Refill valve type is determined by viewing the inside of the fill nozzle and/or identaplate as specified below: 5.9.1.1.1.  Unmodified: Refill valves have a push valve inside the nozzle resembling a standard tire valve stem. 5.9.1.1.2.  Modified:  Refill  valves have a brass  plate/filter covering the inside of the nozzle and no valve stem is visible. 5.9.1.1.3.  Modified2  (Fast  Fill):  Refill  valves  have  a  brass  plate/filter  covering  the inside of the nozzle and no valve stem is  visible.  Part number on the identaplate is one of the following: 9010A4, 9010A5, 3260007-0201, 3260007-0103. 5.9.1.2.  For  aircraft  utilizing  MA-1  portable  oxygen  bottles,  ensure  a  minimum  of  two unmodified/modified2  bottles  are  installed  on  the  aircraft.    Placement  varies  by  MDS; during  preflight,  ensure  at  least  two  unmodified/modified2  bottles  are  placed  in appropriate  locations  to  enable  execution  of  effective  firefighting  and/or  fumes elimination procedures. 5.9.1.2.1.  Enroute  Operations.    While  operating  away  from  home  station,  maintain minimum number of unmodified/modified2 bottles.  If unable, continue until reaching a location with replacement bottles. 5.9.2.  When  an  aircraft  gas  turbine  compressor  or  auxiliary  power  unit  is  being  operated during  preflight  or  other  ground  operation,  a  person  qualified  in  its  operation  must  be  in  a position to monitor audible and/or visual warning systems. (T-2). 50 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 5.10.  Seat  and  Safety  Belt  Requirements.  PICs  must  ensure  each  occupant  over  2  years  old has an approved seat equipped with a safety belt. (T-2).  Aircrew must ensure seatbelts are worn for the following: (T-2). 5.10.1.  When an ejection seat is occupied. 5.10.2.  In the pilot and copilot positions. 5.10.3.  As directed by the PIC. 5.10.4.  During  taxi,  takeoff,  landing,  and  air  refueling  except  for  crewmembers  (including test  personnel  conducting  official  test  points)  performing  official  flight  duties  or  cockpit observation when wearing the seat belt is impractical. 5.10.5.  By each passenger and crewmember to avoid injury in the event of turbulence, unless crew duties dictate or the PIC has authorized otherwise.  The PIC will direct all occupants to fasten seatbelts securely when turbulence is encountered or expected. (T-3). 5.10.6.  If  a  shoulder  harness  is  installed,  wear  it  with  the  seat  belt  during  each  taxi,  and takeoff,  landing  and  critical  phases  of  flight.    Instructors  and  Special  Mission  Aviators (SMA) need not wear the shoulder harness if it interferes with performing duties.  OG/CCs may  waive  this  requirement  for  other  selected  crew  positions  if  the  shoulder  harness interferes with crew duties. 5.11.  High Speed Taxi Checks  .  A high speed taxi check is a maintenance operational check which requires the aircraft to be moving at higher than normal taxi speed.  Consider brake energy limits and cooling when planning high speed taxi checks.  Accomplish high speed taxi checks, to include barrier certifications, according to an approved test plan or established FCF profile.  In the  absence  of  a  test  plan  or  FCF  profile,  these  checks  will  be  approved  by  the  OG/CC  and accomplished by a qualified IP or FCF pilot. (T-3).  In multi-place aircraft, both pilots must be qualified in the aircraft. (T-3).  Document high-speed taxi checks on a flight authorization form. 5.12.  Aircraft  Malfunctions  and  Damage.  Do  not  taxi  aircraft  with  malfunctions  that  affect the nosewheel steering or brake systems.  Do not use a malfunctioning system unless it is needed for safe recovery of the aircraft.  Do not continue in-flight trouble shooting of a malfunction after completing  flight  manual  emergency  procedures.    If  structural  damage  occurs  or  is  suspected, abort the mission and land as soon as practical, regardless of apparent damage. 5.13.  Duty  Station  (multi-place  aircraft).  A qualified pilot  will be at  a set  of controls  of the aircraft  at  all  times  during  flight.  (T-2).    All  primary  aircrew  members  will  be  at  their  duty stations during critical phases of flight. (T-2).  During other phases of flight, crewmembers may leave their duty station for brief periods to meet physiological needs and to perform normal crew duties.    Only  one  pilot  may  be  absent  from  their  duty  station  at  a  time.    Notify  the  aircraft commander before departing assigned primary duty station.  The aircraft commander is the final authority for  allowing personnel  to  move about  the aircraft during flight.   Reference  Table  4.1 AFI 11-202V3 AFMC Sup for further restrictions and exceptions. 5.14.  Transfer  of  Aircraft  Control.  Both  pilots  of  crew  aircraft  or  pilots  in  two-seat  aircraft must know at all times who has control of the aircraft. (T-2).  Transfer of aircraft control is made with  the  statement  “P/CP/You  have  the  aircraft  (controls).”  The  pilot  receiving  control  of  the aircraft will acknowledge “P/CP/I have the aircraft (controls).” (T-2).  Once assuming control of the  aircraft,  maintain  control  until  relinquishing  it  as  stated  above.    For  fighter  and  trainer AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 51 aircraft, if the intercom fails, the pilot in the front cockpit (if not in control of the aircraft) will rock the wings and assume control of the aircraft, radios and navigational equipment unless pre-briefed  otherwise.  (T-2).    In  fighter,  trainer,  attack  aircraft  either  person  flying  can  pump  the stick (“pump  to  pass”) to pass  control to  the other, who should then rock the wings (“shake to take”) to acknowledge transfer of aircraft control. 5.15.  Takeoff Aborts.  Prior to flight, all aircrew (pilots, flight engineers, etc) on the flight deck or  in  the  cockpit  will  review  and  understand  takeoff  data.  (T-3).    Place  particular  emphasis  on takeoff  and  abort  factors  during  abnormal  situations  such  as  short/wet  runway,  heavy  gross weights, and abort sequence in formation flights.  Anytime an aircraft experiences a high speed abort,  hot  brakes  should  be  suspected.    If  confirmed,  declare  a  ground  emergency  and  taxi  the aircraft  to  the  designated  hot  brake  area  and  perform  hot  brake  procedures.    If  an  abort  occurs during  a  takeoff  roll,  the  pilot  will  focus  on  maintaining  directional  control  and  slowing  or stopping the aircraft as appropriate. (T-2).  Following members of a formation ensure clearance from an aborting aircraft or abort their takeoff if unable to maintain adequate clearance 5.16.  G-Awareness.  Perform  a  G-awareness  exercise  whenever  5g  or  greater  are  expected during the sortie.  If available, select Pressure Breathing for G (PBG) on all sorties regardless of anticipated g-loading.  The wearing of the Combat Edge vest in the F-15 and F-16 is optional.  If the  vest  is  not  worn,  the  CRU-94/120  port  plug  should  be  installed  to  ensure  full  pressure  is available to the mask.  F-22 pilots will wear the Combat Edge (UPG) vest on all sorties where flight  will  be  conducted  above  44,000  ft.  MSL.    If  the  UPG  vest  is  not  worn,  F-22  pilots  will ensure and confirm  that the CRU-122 Vest  Port Plug is  installed.   If the  plug is  found missing during flight, then pilots are limited to 6g. (T-2). 5.16.1.  Maintain  a  minimum  of  6,000  ft.  spacing  between  aircraft  during  the  g-awareness exercise.  The g-awareness exercise consists of two turns with at least 90 degrees of heading change.  The second turn of the g-awareness  exercise for air-to-air sorties is  a minimum of 180 degrees of turn.  The first turn is a smooth onset rate to approximately 4g.  Pilots will use this turn to ensure proper g-suit operation and to practice their anti-g straining maneuver. (T-2). Regain airspeed and perform another 90-180 degree turn at up to 6-7g.  If aircraft limits preclude either of the above, turns should be performed so as not to exceed aircraft limits. 5.16.2.  Flight/element  leads  will  ensure  airspace  intended  for  conducting  the  g-awareness exercise is free from potential traffic conflicts. (T-3).  Use air traffic control services to the maximum extent practical to ensure the airspace is clear.  Pilots will conduct the g-awareness exercise in the following airspace with preference to the order as listed: (T-3). 5.16.2.1.  Special  Use  Airspace  (e.g.  restricted/warning  areas,  ATC-Assigned  Airspace (ATCAA),  Military  Operating  Areas  (MOA),  and  MAJCOM  approved  special  mission areas). 5.16.2.2.  Above 10,000 ft. MSL outside of SUA. 5.16.2.3.  Inside the confines of MTR. 5.16.2.4.  Below 10,000 ft. MSL outside of SUA. 5.17.  Unusual  Attitude  and  Training  Maneuvers  (non-aerobatic).  Do  not  perform  unusual attitude recoveries in single seat aircraft, at night or in IMC, and anytime the safety observer is not  qualified  in  the  aircraft.    Abrupt  training  maneuvers  (intentional  maneuvers  involving  an 52 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 abrupt  change  in  aircraft  attitude,  an  abnormal  attitude,  or  abnormal  accelerations  or decelerations not necessary for normal flight) are prohibited at night or in IMC and any time the safety observer is not qualified in the aircraft.  Initiate such maneuvers at an altitude that allows recovery no lower than 5,000 (500 for helicopters) feet AGL.  Perform these type of maneuvers in  SUA,  ATCAA,  MTRs  or  host  nation  approved  airspace.    For  units  without  SUA,  ATCAA, etc, OGs will pre-coordinate and establish repeatable consistent routing and maneuver locations with  ATC  for  unit  mission  accomplishment.  (T-3).    Aircraft  deployed  or  based  at  overseas locations  will  operate  IAW  applicable  host  nation  agreements  or  ICAO  Standard  and Recommended  Practices.  (T-0).    If  the  aircraft  operating  requirements  (altitude  requirements, maximum  airspeeds,  dropping  of  objects,  etc)  dictated  in  the  host  nation  agreement  are  less restrictive than USAF/MAJCOM guidance, use the most restrictive guidance. 5.18.  Simulated  Emergencies.  Do  not  practice  emergency  procedures  that  degrade  aircraft performance or flight control capabilities unless specifically authorized by an approved training syllabus, test plan or in accordance with applicable AFIs.  Do not perform simulated emergency procedures  with  MESPs  or  MEPs  onboard  except  as  defined  in  an  approved  test  plan.    In addition to the restrictions in AFI 11-202V3, the following restrictions apply: 5.18.1.  Fighter, Attack, Trainer, and U-2. 5.18.1.1.  During initial qualification or re-qualification sorties in single seat aircraft, the IP or EP will be in a chase aircraft (U-2 see MD-specific attachment) and in a position to direct a go-around, if needed. (T-3). 5.18.1.2.  Day VMC only. 5.18.1.3.  Gross  weight  cannot  exceed  basic  weight  plus  weight  of  full  internal  fuel  or flight manual limits, whichever is less. 5.18.1.4.  No external ordnance, except training ordnance, may be carried. 5.18.1.5.  Simulated  Single  Engine  (SSE).    Use  all  engines  for  unplanned  go-arounds.  Initiate SSE go-around above 200' AGL.  SSE climb out is not authorized. 5.18.1.6.  No  Flap  full  stop  landings  are  prohibited  unless  required  in  an  approved training syllabus or considered a normal procedure in the flight manual. 5.18.1.7.  Simulated  Flameout  (SFO)  patterns.    Specific  procedures  for  conduct  of  SFO training are established in letters of agreement with appropriate agencies and published in appropriate local publications.  The ceiling may be no lower than 500' above the highest portion  of  prescribed  pattern.    The  SFO  pattern  may  be  entered  from  any  direction  or altitude that ensures the aircraft is properly configured prior to base key and in a position to  safely  complete  the  approach.    An  SFO  is  not  initiated  or  continued  if  a  potential traffic pattern conflict exists which would require that the pilot divide attention between the SFO and sequencing with traffic.  In addition, SFOs should be discontinued whenever excessive maneuvering is needed, whether as a result of a traffic conflict or when making corrections.    Once  discontinued,  initiate  a  go-around  and  do  not  attempt  to  re-enter  or complete  that  pattern/approach.    If  flown  to  a  dry  lakebed,  begin  the  go-around  to descend no lower than 50 ft. AGL.  Full stop and touch-and-go landings may be flown by fully qualified pilots or by students under the direct supervision of an IP or EP.  From the rear  cockpit,  only  qualified  IPs  or  upgrading  IPs  may  fly  SFOs  and  continue  to AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 53 touchdown.    Roll  the  aircraft  to  wings  level  at  a  point  no  lower  than  200  feet  AGL  on final.    Maintain  airspeed  no  slower  than  technical  order  minimum  landing  gear  down airspeed  until  the  sink  rate  is  under  control  and  landing  is  assured.    If  these  parameters are not met perform a go-around. 5.18.1.8.  For all simulated emergency patterns include the type of simulated emergency in the “gear down” radio transmission. 5.18.2.  Bomber, Cargo, Tanker. 5.18.2.1.  Before initiating any simulated emergency, the PIC/IP/EP will brief the cockpit crew  on  the  condition  to  be  simulated  and  state  “simulated”  over  the  interphone communication system prior to accomplishment  of each simulated emergency condition or as the simulated condition is established. (T-3). 5.18.2.2.  Refer  to  Table  5.2  for  additional  restrictions.    Exception:  C-130  and  H-1 aircrew reference MD-specific attachments for restrictions. Table 5.1.

Fuel  Jettisoning/Dumping.  Conduct fuel jettisoning only to reduce aircraft gross weight in  an  emergency,  for  operational  necessity,  or  as  required  for  flight  test  or  FCF.    When circumstances permit, jettison fuel over unpopulated areas at an altitude above 5,000 AGL, when feasible.    Advise  the  appropriate  air  traffic  control  agency  of  intention,  altitude,  and  location when fuel is jettisoned and when the operation has been completed.  Units will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel jettisoning into the atmosphere. (T-2).  Use designated jettison areas and local area procedures to the maximum extent possible, except when safety  of  flight  would  be  compromised.    Refer  to  MD-specific  attachments  for  additional guidance. 5.20.  Fuel  Conservation  .    In  addition  to  AFI  11-202V3  guidance,  all  AFMC  aircrew  will utilize  fuel  conservation  techniques  in  the  conduct  of  their  missions.  (T-2).    Aircrew  should consider  safety-of-flight  first  and  maximize  mission  accomplishment  while  conserving  fuel  to the  maximum  extent  possible.    Actions  to  consider  include  executing  mission  tasks  at  fuel efficient  airspeeds  (such  as  maximum  range  or  endurance),  completing  training  events  in conjunction with test sorties, flying at lower gross weights, deleting unnecessary mission items, etc.. 5.21.  Dropped  Objects.  If  an  object  inadvertently  departs  the  aircraft,  the  aircrew  will  notify the controlling agency as soon as practical; include details of routing, altitude, winds aloft, etc. (T-2).  After landing, notify maintenance and initiate appropriate safety processes. 5.22.  Hazardous  Conditions.  Relay  any  safety  hazard  (e.g.  icing,  turbulence,  thunderstorms, bird concentrations etc.), through a Pilot Weather Report (PIREP) to the controlling agency. 5.23.  Back Seat Landings.  Only qualified or upgrading instructor pilots may conduct back seat landings. 5.24.  Touch-and-Go Landings – Fixed Wing Aircraft. 5.24.1.  Designated  First  Pilots  (FP)  or  Mission  Pilots  (MP)  may  perform  touch-and-go landings at OG/CC designated airfields.  IPs and MP/FPs under IP supervision (on board the aircraft)  may  perform  touch-and-go  landings  at  any  airfield  that  meets  aircraft  landing requirements.  Only pilots that are touch and go qualified or enrolled in an applicable training plan may perform touch and go landings. 5.24.2.  Pilots will not fly touch-and-go landings with passengers onboard the aircraft. (T-2). 5.24.3.  Set all engines to military power or as specified in the flight manual or MD-specific  attachment. 5.24.4.  Fighter and Attack.  Pilots will not perform touch-and-go landings when configured with air-to-air missiles with live rocket motors or air-to-surface ordnance (live or inert) that is AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 55 carted  for  release.  (T-2).    Touch-and-go  landings  may  be  performed  with  live  gun ammunition on board and the master arm in safe. 5.24.5.  Bomber,  Cargo,  Tanker.    A  current  and  qualified  IP  or  touch-and-go  certified  MP must have access to the flight controls and brief the crew on procedures to be followed prior to executing the first touch-and-go landing of a training mission. (T-2).  Refer to Table 5.2 for additional restrictions. 5.24.6.  Unimproved  Landing  Surfaces.    Pilots  must  ensure  touch-and-go  landings  comply with  flight  manual  and  MD-specific  attachment  procedures.  (T-2).    Unless  authorized  by local procedures, touch and go landings on lakebeds are prohibited. 5.24.7.  NVG Touch and Go.  See MD-specific attachments. Table 5.2.  Touch-and-Go Landing Restrictions – Bomber, Cargo, and Tanker (C-130 see MD-specific attachment). IP or EP at a Set of Controls 1.

Pilots must ensure crosswind corrected for RCR is in the recommended zone of the aircraft's landing crosswind chart (T-2).  No IP or EP 1.  Weather is at or above the minimums for the approach being flown, but no lower than 1000' & 3 2.  Day = Same; Night = Dry runway 3.  Crosswind component 10 knots or less 5.25.  Post Arresting Gear Engagement Procedures:  Do not shut down the engine unless fire or  other  conditions  dictate  or  directed  to  do  so  by  the  arresting  gear  crew.    Do  not  raise  the tailhook  or  taxi  until  directed  to  do  so  by  the  arresting  gear  crew.    Further  procedures  are conducted IAW local unit directives (if applicable). 5.26.  Reduced  Runway  Separation  (RRS).  OG/CCs  are  authorized  to  implement  RRS  IAW AFI  13-203,  Air  Traffic  Control,  and  minimum  criteria  established  by  AFMC/A3O.    If implemented,  local  RRS  criteria  and  procedures  should  be  published  in  the  local  flying  (11-series)  directives.    Questions  regarding  AFMC  minimum  RRS  standards  should  be  directed  to AFMC/A3O. 5.27.  Search and Rescue (SARCAP) Procedures.  In the event an aircraft is lost in flight, units must  begin  actions  to  locate  possible  survivors  and  initiate  rescue  efforts.  (T-2).    When establishing  SARCAP,  care  should  be  taken  to  not  endanger  the  aircraft  searching  for  the survivor(s) by flying too low or slow in an attempt to visually acquire the survivor.  Pilots should know their aircraft limits and not unnecessarily place the aircraft so close to airspeed and power limits that an unexpected encounter with a bird or civilian traffic could  cause another accident.  Safety of the searching aircraft is paramount as channelized attention, target (wreckage) fixation, or  marginal  weather  conditions  may  expose  the  searching  aircraft  to  unacceptable  risks.    The following  procedures  are  by  no  means  complete  and  should  be  adjusted  to  meet  each  unique search and rescue situation. 56 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 5.27.1.  Mark.    Mark  the  last  known  position  of  survivor  or  crash  site  using  any  means available.  TACAN,  INS/GPS  position,  ATC/GCI  positioning,  target  pod,  or  ground references should be used to identify the immediate area for subsequent rescue efforts. 5.27.2.  Squawk.    Immediately  terminate  maneuvering  using  appropriate  Knock-It-Off procedures.    Establish  a  SARCAP  on-scene  commander  (OSC).    IFF  should  be  placed  to EMER to alert ATC/GCI of the emergency situation. 5.27.3.  Talk.    Communicate  the  emergency  situation,  including  crash  site  location  and  the downed aircraft’s call sign and type, and aircraft intentions immediately to applicable control agencies.  Broadcast an emergency distress call on GUARD.  Establish communications with survivors  on  GUARD  frequency  or  282.8.    Pass  on  other  pertinent  information  to  rescue forces:  number  and  condition  of  survivors,  ordnance  at  crash  site,  weather  conditions, signaling devices, etc. 5.27.4.  Separate.    Remain  above  the  last  observed  parachute  altitudes  until  position  of  all possible  survivors  is  determined.    The  OSC  deconflicts  other  aircraft  assisting  in  the SARCAP  by altitude to  preclude midair  collision.  Direct  non-essential  aircraft to  clear the area.    Establish  high  and  low  CAPs  as  necessary  to  facilitate  communication  with  other agencies. 5.27.5.  Bingo.    Revise  BINGO  fuels  or  recovery  bases  as  required  to  maintain  maximum SARCAP coverage over survivors/crash site.  Do not over-fly BINGO fuel.  Hand off OSC duties,  if  needed.    Relinquish  SARCAP  operation  to  designated  rescue  forces  upon  their arrival. 5.28.  Flight Test Technique Restrictions. 5.28.1.  High-G Guidance.  The following guidelines are to be used when flying test missions involving  high-G  maneuvers  (defined  as  7.0  Gs  or  greater).    The  term  “sustained  high-  G” applies to a high-G loading duration longer than 5 seconds.  The term “short duration high- G”  applies  to  a  high-G  loading  duration  of  5  seconds  or  less.    Pilots  must  adhere  to  the following limits when performing multiple high G test points: (T-3). 5.28.1.1.  Sustained high-G test points:  No more  than eight  sustained high-G test points per sortie. 5.28.1.2.  Short duration high-G test points: No more than 16 short duration high-G test points per sortie. 5.28.1.3.  When  short  duration  and  sustained  test  points  are  combined,  the  limits  are prorated.  For example, one sortie may contain two sustained high-G test points (25% of the limit) and 12 short duration, high-G tests points (75% of the limit). 5.28.1.4.  The  symmetric  pull-up  (lift  vector  above  the  horizon)  FTT  is  used,  in  lieu  of maneuvering  flight,  when  attempting  to  achieve  load  factors  greater  than  7.0  Gs  below 10,000 feet AGL.

This  attachment,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives, outlines  procedures  for  operation  of  the  A-10  aircraft  under  most  circumstances.    AFMC aircrews and all management levels  concerned with operation of all A-10 aircraft must comply with  the  outlined  requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this  attachment.  Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment. A2.2.  Mission Planning:  No additions. A2.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A2.3.1.  Ground/Taxi Operations. A2.3.1.1.  Pilots  will  be  cleared  by  the  crew  chief  prior  to  starting  the  Auxiliary  Power Unit (APU), engines or actuating flight controls. A2.3.1.2.  All flights require the bleed air function of the APU. A2.3.1.3.  Aircraft stall warning devices will be fully operational for all flights. A2.3.2.  Takeoff. A2.3.2.1.  If RCR waived to  10, the following restrictions apply. When the RCR is less than 12, a run-up check will not be performed prior to brake release, the takeoff roll will not  be  started  until  the  preceding  aircraft  is  airborne,  and  if  the  crosswind  component exceeds the RCR, takeoffs are prohibited. A2.3.2.2.  AFMC/A3  (as  delegated)  authorizes  VFR  takeoffs  if  required  for  mission accomplishment; however, the aircraft must be capable of achieving a minimum single-engine  climb  rate  of  150-feet/minute  (gear  up,  failed  engine  wind-milling,  and  all jettisonable  stores-jettisoned),  unless  a  higher  rate  of  climb  is  required  for  unique obstacle  clearance  requirements.    IFR  takeoffs  will  be  conducted  IAW  AFI  11-202V3. Aircraft operating under IFR that are unable to comply with the required minimum climb gradients  may  be  required  to  reduce  fuel  and  ordnance  loads,  cart  all  stores  (except electronic  countermeasures/targeting  pods),  or  wait  for  environmental  conditions  to change.  If  operational  requirements  dictate,  takeoffs  may  be  made  without  a  positive single-engine climb rate when approved by the OG/CC. A2.3.2.3.  Join-up/Rejoin.  Flight  leaders  will  maintain  200  KIAS  until  join-up  is accomplished unless briefed otherwise. A2.3.3.  Formation Instrument Trail Departure Procedures. A2.3.3.1.  Each  aircraft/element  will  accelerate  to  200  KIAS.  Climb  speed  will  be  200 KIAS and power setting will be 800 degrees ITT unless specifically briefed otherwise. A2.3.3.2.  Each  aircraft/element  will  climb  on  takeoff  heading  to  1,000  feet  AGL  and accelerate  to  200  KIAS  before  initiating  any  turns,  except  when  departure  instructions specifically preclude compliance. 78 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A2.3.4.  Formation  Approaches  and  Landings. approaches above 40,000 pounds gross weight.   Do  not  perform  practice  formation A2.3.5.  Maneuvering Limits. A2.3.5.1.

Simulated, off range air-to-air and air-to-ground attacks requiring activation of the  weapons  release  button  with  expendable  training  ordnance  and/or  suspension equipment are allowed if the following conditions are met: (1) MASTER ARM switch is in  TRAIN,  (2)  Flight  lead  verbally  confirmed  training  mode  (“TRN”  in  the  HUD  or “TRAIN”  on  the  MFCD)  and  acknowledge  throughout  the  flight,  and  (3)  cold  pickle check accomplished and acknowledged throughout the flight. A2.3.6.2.  Simulated,  off-range  air-to-air  and  air-to-ground  attacks  (with  30mm  TP loaded) requiring activation of the gun trigger are allowed if the following conditions are met:  (1) MASTER ARM switch is in TRAIN, (2) GUN/PAC ARM switch is in SAFE, (3) flight lead verbally confirmed training mode (“TRN” in the HUD or “TRAIN” on the MFCD) and acknowledged throughout the flight, and (4) cold trigger check accomplished and acknowledged through the flight (Note: With MA switch in TRAIN and GUN/PAC ARM switch in SAFE, pilots will have BATA but not PAC). A2.3.7.  Air-to-Air Maneuvering Limits. A2.3.7.1.  Pilots  will  not  maintain  an  angle  of  attack  (AOA)  that  triggers  the  chopped stall warning tone. A2.3.7.2.  The minimum maneuvering airspeed during LOWAT is 240 KIAS. A2.3.7.3.  Flaps will not be used as an aid to slow speed maneuvering. A2.3.8.  Air-to-Surface Training Rules. A2.3.8.1.  If airspeed decreases below 210 KIAS in a pop-up attack, abort the maneuver.  Base this airspeed on typical training weights and configurations.  At heavy gross weight, adjust abort airspeed upward to provide sufficient G and turning room to recover from an adverse flight condition. A2.3.8.2.  LSS/LST Procedures.   LSS/LST employment utilizes the concepts of a safety and optimum attack zones. A2.3.8.2.1.  Reference JP 3-09.1 for laser safety and optimal attack zones. A2.3.8.2.2.  LSS/LST  will  not  be  used  as  a  sole  source  for  target  identification.    In some situations, laser spots shift from the designated target to the laser source while operating in the optimal attack zone - precluding total reliance on the laser spot. A2.3.8.2.3.  Attack heading should avoid the target-to-laser designator safety zone to preclude false target indications. A2.4.  Instrument Procedures. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 79 A2.4.1.  The A-10 is Approach Category D. Accomplish missed approach in accordance with the flight manual procedures. A2.4.2.  If using category C approach criteria, use 200 to 210 KIAS to meet missed approach airspeed. A2.4.3.  Use  of  the  Heads-Up  Display.  The  HUD  may  be  used  as  an  additional  instrument reference in night/IMC conditions; however, do not use it as the sole instrument reference in these  conditions.  In  addition,  do  not  use  the  HUD  to  recover  from  an  unusual  attitude  or when executing lost wingman procedures except when no other reference is available. A2.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A2.5.1.  Abnormal Operating Procedures A2.5.1.1.  Fuel  Imbalance:  IAW flight manual  guidance.  Terminate the mission if fuel imbalance  cannot  be  corrected.    Instruments,  navigation  above  2,000  ft.  AGL, deployment missions, and level  weapons deliveries above 2,000 ft.

A2.5.4.  Simulated Single Engine (SSE) Approach/ Landing. A2.5.4.1.  Do  not  initiate  simulated  single  engine  failure  below  1,000  feet  AGL  and terminate if the aircraft descends below 800 feet AGL prior to base leg. A2.5.4.2.  Follow procedures in the flight manual for emergency landing patterns.  Pilots will engage anti-skid prior to landing. A2.5.4.3.  Pilots will plan approaches to avoid turns into the simulated dead engine when practical.  If turns into the simulated dead engine are necessary, plan patterns to minimize bank angle. A2.5.4.4.  SSE approaches will be discontinued if the airspeed decreases below computed single engine final approach speed. A2.5.5.  Manual Reversion. 80 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A2.5.5.1.  A thorough review of manual reversion procedures in the Dash-1 and/or Dash-6 will be accomplished before any flights where manual reversion is a mandatory part of the flight profile. A2.5.5.2.  Other than actual emergencies requiring manual reversion, pilots will only go into  manual  reversion  when  on  a  dedicated  FCF,  FCF  upgrade  sortie,  qualification training sortie, or during an approved test sortie via an approved test plan. A2.5.5.3.  Manual Reversion Operations: If aircraft will not go into Manual Reversion or the pitch trim does not work, return Manual Reversion switch to NORM. A2.5.5.4.  Manual  Reversion  Approach  and  Landing.  Factors  to  consider  are  pilot proficiency,  instrument  approach  facilities,  runway  conditions,  weather  at  the  recovery field,  and  any  accompanying  aircraft  malfunctions.

General  Information.  This  attachment,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives, outlines procedures for operation of the B-2 aircraft under most circumstances.  AFMC aircrews and  all  management  levels  concerned  with  operation  of  B-2  aircraft  must  comply  with  the outlined  requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this  attachment.  Operations  or procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished  if  they  enhance  safe,  effective mission accomplishment. A4.2.  Mission Planning. A4.2.1.  Mission  Briefing.    If  the  interval  from  the  initial  briefing  to  takeoff  exceeds  72 hours, a complete review and briefing must be re-accomplished. A4.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A4.3.1.  Preflight. A4.3.1.1.  Flight  control  BITs  (ABIT).    Pilots  will  complete  an  ABIT  of  the  FCS  after performing any flight control (FC) memory reads. A4.3.2.  Ground/Taxi. A4.3.2.1.  Induction  Icing  Ground  Operations.    If  the  ice  detection  system  indicates  ice and/or  ice  is  noticed  on  the  inlet  areas,  shutdown  the  engines  as  soon  as  possible minimizing  throttle  movement.    The  risk  of  engine  FOD  increases  during  continued operation in  icing conditions  longer than 5 minutes.   If an  ICING advisory  occurs after brake release, crews may continue the takeoff and follow in-flight icing procedures. A4.3.2.2.  Do  not  exceed  10  knots  ground  speed  when  taxiing  over  BAK-9/BAK-12 cables. A4.3.3.  Takeoff. A4.3.3.1.  Unless  a  flight  test  requirement  exists,  do  not  takeoff  if  any  of  the  following conditions exist: A4.3.3.1.1.  Standing or pooled water on the runway. A4.3.3.1.2.  The computed takeoff roll exceeds 80% of the available runway (can be waived by OG/CC). A4.3.3.1.3.  The tailwind exceeds 10 knots (can be waived by OG/CC). A4.3.3.1.4.  Any  attitude  indicator,  heading  indicator,  or  standby  instrument  is inoperative. A4.3.3.1.5.  One  or  more  engines  are  inoperative  from  the  start  of  takeoff  roll.  During emergency evacuations and at the discretion of the wing commander or with higher  headquarters  approval,  aircraft  may  takeoff  with  one  or  more  engines inoperative.  Under no circumstances should a crew take off with a computed takeoff distance that exceeds 95 percent of runway available. 86 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A4.3.3.1.6.  Over any  raised web barrier  (MA-1A or 61QS11).   Do not  start takeoff roll  prior  to  approach  end  cables.    Takeoffs  accomplished  beyond  approach-end cables  are  permitted  provided  at  least  the  minimum  runway  length  specified  in Chapter 2 is available beyond the cable. A4.3.3.2.  If  CFL  is  computed  to  be  greater  than  80%  of  the  available  runway,  aircrew will use full available thrust on takeoff (TRT) and have OG/CC approval for operations. A4.3.4.  Formation.    Because  B-2  formation  flight  within  AFMC  is  uncommon,  users  will refer to AFI 11-2B-2 Volume 3, B-2 Operations Procedures. A4.3.5.  Chase  Procedures.    A  safety  chase  is  not  required  for  flights  that  primarily  occur under  IFR  control  or  in  exclusive  use  airspace.    A  safety  chase  is  not  required  for  flights within the R2508 complex outside of high traffic areas (at or above FL350).  A safety/photo chase will be used as required on test flights per the approved safety package. A4.3.6.  Air Refueling. A4.3.6.1.  Do not conduct air refueling with control stick steering engaged. A4.3.6.2.  Do not conduct air refueling with an FCS CAUTION, except when necessary for safe recovery of the aircraft. A4.3.6.3.  Do  not  conduct  air  refueling  with  less  than  four  engines  operating,  except when  necessary  for  safe  recovery  of  the  aircraft.    Simulated  engine  out  air  refueling  is permitted  under  IP  supervision.    Pilots  will  place  no  more  than  one  throttle  to  idle  to simulate the loss of one engine. A4.3.6.4.  Do  not  conduct  air  refueling  when  the  tanker  has  less  than  all  engines operating, unless required for safe recovery of the aircraft. A4.3.6.5.  Do  not  conduct  air  refueling  when  tanker  aircraft  is  unable  to  retract  landing gear. A4.3.6.6.  Discontinue  air  refueling  after  loss  of  all  tanker  disconnect  capability,  except during the following conditions: A4.3.6.6.1.  Emergency fuel situation or emergency evacuation.  Limit contact time to that required to obtain fuel. A4.3.6.6.2.  Flight  test  mission  warranting  the  increased  risk  as  agreed  upon  by  the test director and aircraft commander.  It must be accomplished under IP supervision.  Limit contact time to that required to obtain fuel. A4.3.6.7.  Do not accomplish breakaway training while in contact. A4.3.6.8.  Boom envelope demonstrations require IP supervision. A4.3.6.9.  Visual  Observation  Position.    Using  quick-flow  procedures  from  the  ATP 56(B),  the  route/visual  observation  position  may  be  used  to  expedite  day,  VMC  AR operations.    The  position  is  defined  as  a  30-70  degree  cone  aft  of  tanker’s  3/9  line,  no closer than 150 feet (wing tip spacing) and no farther than 1,000 feet.  Use of the position requires clearance by the tanker. A4.3.7.  Landing. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 87 A4.3.7.1.  Do  not  land  prior  to  approach  end  cables.    Landing  beyond  approach-end cables is permitted provided at least the minimum runway length specified in Chapter 2 is available beyond the cable. A4.3.7.2.  See Table A4.1 for traffic pattern limitations. Table A4.1.  Traffic Pattern and Landing Limitations and Restrictions.

Minimum weather:  Whichever is higher. 3.  Normal Master Mode Touch & Go landings with the speed brakes intentionally retracted require an IP and should only be accomplished as a part of a formal training syllabus. 4.  Initiate low approach/go-around no lower than 200 feet height above touchdown.  5.  Use four engines for non-briefed/unplanned go-arounds.  6.  Use of MCT or TRT for the low approach/go-around is at the discretion of the aircraft commander. 7.  Use all 4 engines for the “go” portion of the Touch & Go. A4.3.8.  Air-to-Surface Weapons Employment. A4.3.8.1.  Do  not  release  weapons  if  a  release  system,  indicator,  or  weapon  bay  door malfunction  exists,  unless  the  malfunction  is  only  a  loss  of  redundancy  which  does  not affect  weapons  accuracy  or  normal  weapons  release  (e.g.,  single  power  drive  unit controller failure). A4.3.8.2.  While  carrying  weapons,  do  not  conduct  simulated  bomb  runs,  unusual maneuvers  (unless  necessary  for  flight  test),  or  other  potentially  hazardous  activity.  Carrying weapons does not preclude accomplishing air refueling.  Touch and go's may be 88 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 accomplished  with  inert  weapons  that  are  un-carted/pinned/inert  separation  nuts installed(all that are possible). A4.3.8.3.  Do  not  complete  weapon  unlock/release  enable/release  consent  for  releasable (carted/pinned) live or inert weapons until the aircraft is on the range, cleared HOT by the controlling authority, and weapons impact would be in the range danger area. A4.3.8.4.  Do not open weapon bay doors during flight with weapons on board other than for intentional release, jettison, or if necessary for flight test (e.g. captive carry). A4.3.8.5.  Do not practice simulated emergency procedures when weapons are loaded on the aircraft. A4.3.8.6.  Do not “manually” rotate RLAs in partial SIM without RLAs installed. A4.3.8.7.  Weather Minimums/IMC Weapons Deliveries.  If range procedures permit, B-2  pilots  may  release  live  or  inert  weapons  in  IMC.    Unless  further  restricted  by  range guidance, B-2 aircrews will adhere to the following when conducting IMC operations or dropping through an undercast: A4.3.8.7.1.  GPS  FOM  greater  than  or  equal  to  4  requires  one  OAP  or  target  direct aiming on a 0.8 NM CM map.  Without GPS and system buffers greater than 250 ft., one OAP within 5 minutes of release (or target direct aiming) on a 0.8 NM CM map is required. A4.3.8.7.2.  For Coordinate only releases:  Do not release if GPS FOM greater than or equal  to  4.      For  non-GPS  integrated  releases,  do  not  release  if  navigation  system buffers are greater than or equal to 250 ft. and buffer values have been verified via a 0.8 NM CM map within 10 minutes of release. A4.3.8.8.  Hung weapons procedures. A4.3.8.8.1.  If  pilots  receive  hung  munitions  indications,  they  will  accomplish abort/post  release  checklist  actions  to  safe  the  weapons,  terminate  all  subsequent bombing activity scheduled for the sortie, and return to base or other suitable landing base, avoiding over-flight of populated areas. A4.3.8.8.2.  Pilots  will  jettison  weapons  only  if,  in  the  opinion  of  the  pilot  in command,  the  retention  of  stores  would  adversely  affect  the  safe  recovery  of  the aircraft.  After a successful jettison with suspected or known hung munitions, do not accomplish any further weapons delivery activity. A4.4.  Instrument Procedures. A4.4.1.  The B-2A is designated as an approach category D aircraft. A4.4.2.  Synthetic ILS (SILS) and Synthetic TACAN (STACAN) approaches require VMC.  Visual glide path guidance is required at night. A4.4.3.  Flight in Precipitation/Icing Procedures. A4.4.3.1.  Lightning  Strike/Static  Discharge.    In  the  event  of  a  known  or  suspected lightning strike or static discharge, terminate the mission and maintain below 250 KCAS when practical. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 89 A4.4.3.2.  Avoid thunderstorms laterally by 20 NM when below FL 200. A4.4.3.3.  Avoid thunderstorms laterally by 40 NM when at or above FL 200. A4.4.3.4.  When at  or above FL 200, stay VMC  when within 40 NM of any convective activity, not just thunderstorms, which have built above FL 200. A4.4.3.5.  Avoid cruising at altitudes in IMC, or in areas of precipitation, that are within +/- 5,000 feet or +/- 10 degrees Celsius of the forecast or actual freezing level.  Climb or descend through these areas as rapidly as is safely possible. A4.4.3.6.  Do not climb or descend through forecast or reported icing conditions greater than light. A4.4.3.7.  Do not cruise in any forecast or actual icing conditions. A4.4.3.8.  Maintain Mach .65 or greater to minimize amount of ice accumulated (in icing conditions). A4.4.3.9.  Minimize throttle movements with anti-ice/rain removal operating A4.4.4.  INS/GPS/RVSM Flight. A4.4.4.1.  RNAV and GPS approaches are not authorized. A4.4.4.2.  Reduced  Vertical  Separation  Minimum  (RVSM)  Airspace.    Airspace  where RVSM  is applied is  considered special qualification airspace.  Both  the aircrew and the specific aircraft must be approved for operations in these areas.  All B-2As are approved for  restricted  operation  within  RVSM  airspace  as  documented  in  Figure  A4.1  B-2A RVSM  Envelope  Limitations.  Refer  to  FLIP  GP  and  the  following  guidance  for additional RVSM requirements: A4.4.4.3.  Required RVSM Equipment.  Both altimeters (MDUs, one display before each pilot, and the standby altimeter), the autopilot altitude hold function, the IFF transponder altitude  reporting  (Mode  C),  and  the  flight  control  system  (to  include  the  air  data  ports and  their  heaters)  must  be  fully  operational  (defined  as  not  more  than  single  channel failed) before entry into RVSM airspace.  Should any failures of this equipment beyond the  allowable  single  channel  failure  occur,  immediately  notify  ATC  and  coordinate further  clearance.    If  failure  occurs  before  entering  RVSM  airspace,  request  a  new clearance so as to avoid this airspace, or request ATC special handling as a non-equipped aircraft. level  cruise  periods A4.4.4.3.1.  Autopilot.    The  altitude  hold  function  of  the  autopilot  shall  be  engaged throughout in  RVSM  airspace,  except  when  special circumstances  dictate,  such  as  when  turbulence  procedures  require  disengagement.  Report  any  aircraft  deviations  greater  than  130  ft.  from  the  commanded  altitude  to maintenance. A4.4.4.3.2.  Altimeters.  Crosscheck primary altitude displays with standby altimeter, before or immediately upon entry to RVSM airspace. A4.4.4.4.  RVSM  Operations.    Monitor  systems  and  crosscheck  altimeters  on  primary displays to ensure they agree +/- 10 ft. 90 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A4.4.4.4.1.  Aircrews  should  limit  climb  and  descent  rates  to  a  maximum  of  1,000 feet per minute when operating in RVSM airspace to reduce potential effects on other aircraft’s  Traffic  Alert  and  Collision  Avoidance  System  (TCAS)  operations,  and  to minimize risk of overshooting desired altitude during level-off. A4.4.4.5.  Post  Flight.   Document (in the AFTO Forms 781) malfunctions or failures of RVSM  required  equipment,  including  the  failure  of  this  equipment  to  meet  RVSM tolerances. Figure A4.1.  B-2A RVSM Envelope Limitations.  A4.4.5.  B-2 BRNAV, RNP-10, MNPS RNP-12.6.  The B-2 aircraft is cleared for operations in  Basic  Area  Navigation  (BRNAV),  Required  Navigation  Performance-10  (RNP-10),  and North Atlantic (NAT) Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) airspace. A4.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A4.5.1.  Brief  all  practice  maneuvers  or  emergency  procedures  before  the  maneuver  (either in-flight or during mission planning). A4.5.2.  Do not practice compound simulated emergencies during critical phases of flight. A4.5.3.  After taking the appropriate action to rectify a malfunction, resume training only if the designated pilot in command determines no hazard to safe aircraft operations exists.  In an actual emergency, terminate all training and emergency procedures practice. A4.5.4.  Brake  and nose  wheel  steering malfunctions.  Do not  taxi  the aircraft  with  a brake system malfunction.  Do not taxi with a nose wheel steering malfunction with the exception of  using  nose  wheel  steering  override,  or  differential  braking  to  clear  the  active  runway.  AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 91 After clearing the runway, the pilots will stop until the malfunction can be cleared.  If nose wheel  failure  occurs  in-flight  and  cannot  be  cleared  or  reset,  aircrews  may  taxi  the  aircraft clear  of  the  runway  using  NWS  Override  or  differential  braking  and  stop  until  the malfunction can be cleared. A4.5.5.  Practice unusual attitude recoveries are prohibited in flight. A4.5.5.1.  Nose  High  Recovery  Procedure.    To  recover  from  a  nose  high  attitude,  add power as required, establish a bank angle of no more than 60 degrees, lower the nose to a minimum minus three degree pitch attitude, then return the aircraft to level flight in both pitch and bank. A4.5.5.2.  Nose Low Recovery Procedure.  Recover from a nose low attitude by reducing power and extending speed brakes as required, rolling wings level, then increasing stick back pressure to return the aircraft to level flight.  92 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 Attachment 5 B-52 OPERATING PROCEDURES A5.1.  General  Information.  This  attachment,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives, outlines  procedures  for  operation  of  the  B-52  aircraft  under  most  circumstances.    AFMC aircrews and all management levels  concerned with operation of all B-52 aircraft must comply with  the  outlined  requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this  attachment.  Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment. A5.2.  Mission Planning. A5.2.1.  Low Altitude Charts.  Each pilot team and each navigator/CSO team will carry a low altitude chart if the crew will conduct low altitude operations. A5.2.2.  Takeoff Planning Criteria.  A minimum  of 1,000 feet  overrun must  be available in addition  to  the  minimum  runway  required  (MRR).  When  1,000  feet  of  overrun  is  not available,  reserve  a  portion  of  the  runway  to  satisfy  the  minimum  overrun  requirements. Runway  available  for  takeoff  planning  must  be  actual  runway  length  minus  any  portion  of the runway used to satisfy overrun requirements at the departure end of the runway. A5.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A5.3.1.  Traffic Pattern Limitations. A5.3.1.1.  Touch-and-go landings are authorized only under the following conditions: A5.3.1.1.1.  Use a runway of sufficient width and length to permit a safe, normal full stop  landing  without  the  drag  chute.  Make  the  actual  touchdown  in  the  designated TDZ of the runway at a point and speed which would enable a safe full stop landing on the remaining runway. Initiate a go-around if this is not possible. A5.3.1.1.2.  Non-IP  aircraft  commanders  are  limited  to  a  maximum  of  4  degrees crosswind crab. A5.3.1.1.3.  Instructor  pilots  or  aircraft  commanders  will  brief  (either  in-flight  or during mission planning) the individual being supervised on the following items prior to supervising touch-and-go landings. A5.3.1.1.3.1.  Flight manual procedures. A5.3.1.1.3.2.  The importance of smooth power application and stabilizing power before advancing throttles. A5.3.1.1.3.3.  Compressor stalls, including proper preventive action, recognition, and corrective action. A5.3.1.1.3.4.  Emergency jettison of drag chute. A5.3.1.1.3.5.  Proper use of airbrakes and stabilizer trim. A5.3.1.1.3.6.  Instructor Pilot (IP) or Aircraft Commander (AC) taking control of aircraft when necessary. A5.3.1.1.3.7.  Unplanned go-around using all throttles. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 93 A5.3.1.2.  Do not practice landings with less than 100 percent flaps, except where noted. A5.3.1.3.  Normally, deploy the drag chute on  all full stop  landings. Should  operational requirements dictate a full stop landing be made without a drag chute, comply with flight manual taxi back limitations. A5.3.1.4.  Do not perform taxi back landings on wet runways. A5.3.1.5.  See Table A5.1 for in-flight and traffic pattern limitations. A5.3.2.  Flare Drop Activity. A5.3.2.1.  Conduct  live  flare  drop  activity  only  in  authorized  special  use  airspace contained in current FLIP planning documents and over water firing areas. A5.3.2.2.  Do not power the flare ejector system until within the approved flare drop area. A5.3.2.3.  Do  not  accomplish  low  approaches  or  touch-and-go  landings  after  making  or attempting a flare drop. Touch-and-go's are authorized after munitions specialists confirm all  flares  were  dispensed  (none  remaining).  Do  not  attempt  a  taxi-back  sortie  with confirmed hung, retained, or misfired flares. A5.3.2.4.  In case of an inadvertent flare drop, take the following actions: A5.3.2.4.1.  Immediately safe the flare ejector system. A5.3.2.4.2.  Record time and geographic coordinates of the inadvertent release. A5.3.2.4.3.  Contact  the  applicable  airspace  controller  and  advise  them  of  the incident, approximate location and estimated damage. A5.3.2.4.4.  Units will develop local procedures to handle hung/hot flare situations if flares will be carried and/or expended in flight. A5.3.3.  NVG Procedures. A5.3.3.1.  The pilot flying the aircraft will use TA procedures, radar altimeter, and visual inputs gained from the NVG to maintain the proper terrain clearance. NVGs will not be used for visual contour low-level or visual formation. A5.3.3.2.  Cockpit  Lighting.    AFTTP  3-3.B-52  will  be  used  as  the  baseline  for  proper NVG cockpit setup.  Units may supplement this information.  Approved lighting systems include the indigenous NVG cockpit lighting (C+ modification), cyalume light sticks, and an  approved  battery  powered  LED  light  bar.    Always  carry  cyalume  light  sticks  as  a backup  as  they  remain  the  most  reliable  means  of  cockpit  lighting.    Unless  on  an approved  test  plan,  do  not  use  NVGs  without  one  of  the  cockpit  lighting  systems mentioned above. A5.3.4.  Air-to-Surface Employment A5.3.4.1.  The  radar  navigator/navigator/CSO  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the  proper ballistics are loaded for the target and the proper bomb code (B-XX) is input into Format 10 for the target destination. A5.3.4.2.  Do  not  open  bomb  bay  doors  during  flight  with  internal  weapons  on  board other than for intentional release, jettison or if directed in an approved test plan. 94 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A5.3.4.3.  While carrying internal weapons, do not simulate internal weapons release and while  carrying  external  weapons,  do  not  simulate  external  weapons  release.  Carrying weapons  does  not  preclude  accomplishing  fighter  intercept  exercise,  air  refueling,  and transition  excluding  touch-and-go  landings  and  simulated  engine-loss.    Furthermore,  it does not preclude accomplishing simulated external weapons or missile runs, with SMO simulations, while in "full sim" with actual weapons carried internally. A5.3.4.4.  If  all  weapons  were  loaded  externally  in  positions  visible  to  the  aircrew, releases  may  be  visually  confirmed  by  the  aircrew  in  lieu  of  confirmation  by  an  RCO. Internal light indications must be consistent with visual observation. Do not rely on visual inspections  by  other  aircraft  or  non-range  personnel  to  clear  the  aircraft  for  subsequent training activity. A5.3.4.5.  If RCO confirmation of internal release is not possible, crews must perform a visual bomb bay check prior to conducting any additional training. A5.3.4.6.  Any  crewmember  entering  the  bomb  bay  must  be  qualified  and  must  avoid inadvertent contact with the release mechanisms. A5.3.4.7.  Crewmembers  will  not  enter  the  bomb  bay  to  release  bombs  or  to  perform maintenance on release equipment. A5.3.4.8.  Observe  the  following  safety  precautions  for  continued  activity  with  retained weapons: A5.3.4.8.1.  No weapons will be programmed against any target that is not within an approved training or test area. A5.3.4.8.2.  Accomplish  post subsequent training activity. release/abort  checklist  before  conducting  any A5.3.4.8.3.  No release system, indicator, or weapon bay door malfunction may exist. A5.3.4.9.  If  release  is  verified  by  the  RCO  and  internal  light  indications  are  consistent with  RCO  observations,  aircrews  may  conduct  additional  training  without  restriction provided no weapons remain on the aircraft. The RCO must positively confirm the exact number of weapons programmed for release. A5.3.4.10.  For  internal  weapons,  aircrews  will  visually  inspect  the  bomb  bay  if  a  hung weapon is suspected.  If there are no weapons remaining on the aircraft, the aircrew may conduct additional training without restriction. A5.3.5.  Low Altitude Operations. A5.3.5.1.  Icing.  Do not conduct low altitude flight in areas of forecast severe icing or in areas  of  reported  moderate  or  severe  icing  conditions.    If  moderate  or  severe  icing  is encountered, abort the low altitude area. A5.3.5.2.  Turbulence.    Do  not  fly  low-level  in  areas  of  forecast  severe  turbulence.    Do not  fly  low-level  with  forecast  moderate  turbulence  associated  with  mountain  wave effects,  or  with  moderate  or  severe  turbulence  reported  by  military  aircraft.    If  aircraft type (military or civilian) reporting turbulence is  unknown, contact  appropriate ARTCC for advisory.  If moderate or severe turbulence is encountered, abort the low-level area. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 95 A5.3.5.3.  Visibility/Cloud  Clearance  Requirements.    Weather  for  TA  operations  on  IR routes  must  be  at  or  better  than  TA  Visual  Conditions  (clear  of  clouds  with  3  miles forward visibility). If TA Visual Conditions cannot be maintained, climb to MSA/IFR as soon  as  practical.  Weather  conditions  for  operations  on  VR  routes  must  be  1500/3.  If these  weather  conditions  cannot  be  met,  abort  the  route.    For  night  operations,  weather must meet the applicable day criteria. In addition, sufficient light and visibility must exist to  recognize  major  changes  in  terrain  elevations  such  as  mountain  peaks,  ridgelines, valleys, and sloping terrain (NVGs may be used to satisfy visibility requirement). A5.3.5.4.  Equipment Restrictions: A5.3.5.4.1.  Mapping Radar Failure (Scope Blank or Inadequate for Navigation). Do not  fly  low-level,  during  day  IMC  or  night,  with  mapping  radar  failure.  Aircraft without mapping radar may penetrate to low altitude during daylight hours provided TA Visual Conditions can be maintained and the RN or Nav station has an operating FLIR  or  STV  display.    Abort  the  route  if  weather  conditions  fall  below  TA  Visual Conditions at any time. A5.3.5.4.2.  OAS  Processors.  Do  not  fly  low-level  without  an  operating  OAS processor during night or IMC.  Crews may penetrate to low-level and fly the route as long as day TA Visual Conditions can be maintained. A5.3.5.4.3.  Multi-Function Displays (MFDs).  Do not fly low-level unless there is at least one operable MFD at the RN or Nav station. A5.3.5.4.4.  Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS).  Do not fly low-level with a malfunctioning AHRS. Exception: The AHRS does not need to be fully operational if  one  Inertial  Navigation  System  (INS)  is  providing  accurate  heading  and  there  is accurate MD-1 gyro stabilization for the pilot’s attitude director indicator (ADI) (this exception applies for day TA Visual Conditions only). A5.3.5.4.5.  Radar  Altimeter.    TA  or  EVS/visual  contour  flight  without  a  properly operating radar altimeter is prohibited. A5.3.5.4.6.  Additional Night Equipment Restrictions. The following equipment must be fully operational for night TA operations, with or without NVGs: A5.3.5.4.6.1.  Mapping radar (for any night low-level operation). A5.3.5.4.6.2.  Terrain avoidance system. A5.3.5.4.6.3.  Doppler/INS.  Either  Doppler  or  INS  ground  speed  and  drift information may be used. A5.3.5.4.6.4.  EVS.    Either  Steer-able  TV  (STV)  or  Forward  Looking  Infrared (FLIR) must be operational for night TA operations. A5.3.5.4.6.5.  Do  not  fly  night  TA  if  the  aircraft  performance  is  significantly degraded; for example, engine out or main gear extended. A5.3.6.  Low Altitude Limitations. A5.3.6.1.  Low  altitude  weight  restriction  is  230,000  to  420,000  pounds.  These restrictions apply whenever the aircraft is operated at or below 5,000 feet above ground 96 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 level or during ocean surveillance/reconnaissance operations at or below 5,000 feet MSL. The minimum low altitude weight restriction does not apply to en route, cruise or traffic pattern operations. A5.3.6.2.  Use  of  the  autopilot  non-steering  modes,  other  than  second  station,  is  not recommended for low altitude operations. Do not use non-steering modes of the autopilot below 1,000 feet AGL except for the stab modes comparison check. A5.3.6.3.  Bank  angles  during  low-level  or  operations  below  1,000  feet  AGL/ASL  are limited  to  30  degrees  maximum.  Use  steep  turn  guidance  as  applicable  for  higher altitudes. A5.3.6.4.  Normal  minimum  clearance  plane  settings:  300  feet  day  and  500  feet  night.  However, 200 feet clearance plane may be flown if necessary for the accomplishment of a  test  point  or  FCF.    The  time  spent  at  this  altitude  will  be  kept  to  a  minimum.  The determining  factor  will  be  crew  judgment,  based  on  evaluations  of  aircraft  equipment, weather conditions, aircrew capabilities, proficiency, and fatigue. A5.3.6.5.  Do not conduct TA or EVS/visual contour flight without a properly operating radar altimeter. A5.3.7.  TA Procedures. A5.3.7.1.  Crewmembers  must  use  all  means  available  to  clear  terrain,  including  EVS equipment. Sound crew judgment must be used to determine whether current conditions warrant  TA  flight.  If  there  is  any  doubt,  the  crew  should  climb  to  a  safe  altitude immediately. A5.3.7.2.  Descent from IFR altitude must be accomplished in TA Visual Conditions. The PTAIP, or Start TA Point, is not a mandatory start descent point. The OAS radar will be in full scan TA (Plan Position Indicator {PPI} display or Displaced Center Plan Position Indicator  {DCPPI}  display)  for  all  descents  to  TA  altitudes.  Range  marks  will  be displayed to the maximum extent possible (N/A day Visual Flight Rules {VFR}). A5.3.7.3.  TA flying under a cloud  deck can be extremely hazardous, particularly under conditions  of  rising  terrain  or  decreasing  ceiling.  In  this  case,  climb  immediately  to MSA/IFR. A5.3.7.4.  Attempt  to  maintain  route  centerline  when  flying  at  IFR  altitudes  without visual  terrain  clearance.  Crews  are  not  authorized  to  deviate  from  published  route corridor except when aborting the route.  Note: If a conflict arises between the pilot and navigator/CSO  information,  climb  to  a  safe  altitude  and  resolve  it;  obtain  further  flight clearance if necessary. If differences are resolved resume scheduled training activity. A5.3.7.5.  If  aircraft  position  is  unknown,  immediately  climb  to  MSA/IFR  altitude.    If position  cannot  be  determined  after  climbing  to  MSA/IFR  altitude  or  any  time  route corridor has been exceeded, abort the route. A5.3.7.6.  Whenever bank angle exceeds 15 degrees the pilot flying the aircraft will make the turn visually or, if at night, initiate a climb to a safe altitude before executing the turn. A5.3.7.7.  Crews  may  omit  the  circled  items  of  the  Descent,  After  Descent,  and  TA Compensation  checklist  when  weather  conditions  or time  constraints  prevent AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 97 accomplishment  of  the  comparison/FRL  compensation.    During  night  mountainous conditions,  crews  will  accomplish  the  entire  checklist  unless  the  TA  set  has  been previously compensated. A5.3.7.8.  Do not practice radar silent operations in IMC or at night. A5.3.8.  Chase Operations. A5.3.8.1.  It  is  unsafe  to  fly  in  close  vertical  proximity  to  another  aircraft  due  to  the interrelated  aerodynamic  effects.  Never  fly  directly  over  or  under  another  aircraft.  The chase position for fighter/trainers chasing the B-52 is defined as: A5.3.8.2.  Wings level position - at least 100 feet between wing tips or; A5.3.8.3.  Stern position - approximately 1/4 mile behind and 100 feet below lead. A5.3.8.4.  The normal chase position will be on the right wing of lead. A5.3.8.5.  The  lead  aircraft  must  inform  the  chase  aircraft  and  receive  acknowledgment prior to initiating turns, climbs and descents, airspeed changes, or configuration changes (e.g. flaps, gear, airbrakes, etc.). A5.4.  Instrument Procedures. A5.4.1.  Approach  Category.    The  B-52  is  normally  approach  category  D.    Category  E  is applicable when best flare plus ten knots or approach speed exceeds 165. A5.5.  Operational Limits And Restrictions. A5.5.1.  Steep  Turns.    Except  when  otherwise  required  by  an  approved  test  plan,  limit  the maximum  target  bank  angle  to  45  degrees  (not  to  exceed  60  degrees).  The  aircraft  must remain clear of clouds throughout  the maneuver.  Do not perform steep turns during traffic pattern  operations.  For  steep  turns  at  or  below  5,000  feet  AGL/ASL,  the  following restrictions apply: A5.5.1.1.  Weather must be day VFR. A5.5.1.2.  Maneuver  must  be  accomplished  at  or  above  1,000  feet  AGL/ASL  with  the flaps up. The aircrew will maintain at or above the minimum recommended airspeed or Mach for the planned bank angle throughout the maneuver. A5.5.2.  Initial Buffet. A5.5.2.1.  Perform  initial  buffet  practice  as  prescribed  in  the  flight  manual  and  under instructor pilot supervision. A5.5.2.2.  Pilots must review and discuss the correct recovery procedures and limitations for accomplishing initial buffet with the crew during mission planning. A5.5.2.3.  Practice  recovery  from  initial  buffet  at  a  minimum  altitude  of  20,000  feet above the terrain. If clouds exist between the aircraft and the terrain, the aircraft must be at  least  10,000  feet  above  the  tops  of  the  clouds.  Do  not  practice  recovery  from  initial buffet above FL 300 or at gross weights above 300,000 pounds. A5.5.2.4.  Perform the entire initial buffet maneuver with wings level. A5.5.2.5.  Do not practice initial buffet with weapons or missiles loaded. 98 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A5.5.3.  Fuel  Minimums.  In  addition  to  the  fuel  requirements  of  chapter  2,  the  minimum fuel reserve for remote or island destination is 34,000 pounds. If weather conditions are such that  an  alternate  airfield  is  required  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-202V3,  then  minimum  fuel reserve is 54,000 pounds. A5.5.4.  Air Refueling Limitations and Restrictions.   Do not accomplish air refueling during training missions when two or more engines are shut down or when any engine has been shut down  due  to  fire  or  fire  indication.    Also  do  not  accomplish  air  refueling  when  the  aircraft gross weight is less than 230,000 pounds. A5.5.5.  Emergency Limitations. A5.5.5.1.  If  it  becomes  necessary  to  shut  down  two  or  more  engines  or  one  engine  for fire or fire indication, abort the mission. A5.5.5.2.  Refueling is not authorized with two or more engines inoperative or when any engine is shut down due to fire or fire indication, except when fuel is required to safely recover the aircraft. A5.5.5.3.  Compute performance with one or more engines inoperative assuming the loss of another engine. A5.5.5.4.  Aircraft with confirmed or suspected fuel leaks will abort the mission. Remain in  the local  area or proceed to  the departure base or destination base by  the most direct route. If circumstances permit, reduce to routine landing weight. Do not allow the center of  gravity  to  exceed  safe  limitations  or  attempt  any  training  activity,  which  would jeopardize safe recovery of the aircraft. A5.5.6.  Fuel Quantity Indication System Failure.  Normally, each fuel quantity indicator for each  fuel  tank  must  be  fully  operational.  If  a  fuel  quantity  indicating  system  failure  is discovered prior to flight, the following exceptions apply: A5.5.6.1.  When a standard fuel  load results in  one or more  empty tanks, the respective fuel quantity indicator for the empty tank need not be fully operational provided: A5.5.6.1.1.  The  tank  will  remain  empty  throughout  the  flight,  including  in-flight refueling. A5.5.6.1.2.  The fuel quantity gauge indicates zero. A5.5.6.1.3.  The circuit breaker for the respective indicator is pulled and a safety clip installed to prevent inadvertent resetting. A5.5.6.2.  Aircraft may be flown with either one external or one outboard, but not more than  one,  wing  tank  gauge  inoperative  or  malfunctioning,  provided  the  following procedures are adhered to: A5.5.6.2.1.  The aircraft is loaded with a standard fuel load. A5.5.6.2.2.  The circuit breaker for the inoperative or malfunctioning gauge is pulled and a safety clip installed to prevent inadvertent resetting. In this situation, the pilots must  realize  that  regardless  of  the  gauge  indication,  the  total  fuel  quantity  indicator will  be  receiving  indications  that  the  tank  is  empty.  Therefore,  there  will  be  a AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 99 discrepancy between the total  fuel  quantity indication and the actual  amount  of fuel on board. A5.5.6.2.3.  The fuel flow indicator for that tank is fully operational. A5.5.6.2.4.  Pilots must be particularly watchful when using fuel from a tank having an inoperative or malfunctioning fuel gauge since the only indication of fuel flow will be the fuel flow indicator light, lateral trim indications, and balance of fuel between main tanks one and four. The Fuel Quantity Indicating System (FQIS) sends a voltage to  the  total  fuel  quantity  gauge  rather  than  a  restrictive  value.  When  the  circuit breaker  is  pulled,  the  indication  to  the  total  fuel  quantity  indicator  from  that  gauge will be zero. A5.5.7.  Aircraft/Aircrew Limitations A5.5.7.1.  In  B-52  aircraft,  personnel  occupying  ejection  seats  may  unstrap  their parachute during non-critical phases of flight provided the ejection seat pins are installed (trigger  ring  stowed),  seat  belts  remain  fastened  and  adverse  weather/turbulence  is  not expected.  This  does  not  preclude  briefly  vacating/swapping  seats  at  safe  clearance altitudes,  pattern  altitudes,  or  safe  distance  from  tanker  at  the  discretion  of  the  PIC. Personnel  not  occupying  ejection  seats  may  unstrap  their  parachute  during  non-critical phases  of  flight.  Instructors/evaluators  not  occupying  ejection  seats  are  exempt  from wearing  parachutes  when  performance  of  their  essential  duties  makes  wearing  the parachute  impractical.  All  crewmembers  will  wear  helmets  during  initial  takeoff/climb out,  air  refueling  from  1/2  mile  through  termination  of  actual  refueling  operations,  low altitude  training  routes,  flight  characteristics  demonstration,  flight  below  10,000  feet MSL  and  any  time  an  armed  ejection  seat  is  occupied.  Pilots  will  have  a  visor  down during  any  operations  exceeding  300  KIAS  below  10,000  feet  MSL.  If  the  visor interferes with the ability to see the instruments or terrain, minimize the time spent with the visor up. A5.5.7.2.  Only the following compound practice emergencies are authorized with an IP in the seat. A5.5.7.2.1.  Single Engine Loss on Takeoff following a Six Engine Landing see note 3 Table 5.1. A5.5.7.2.2.

No lower than circling minimums or 1,000 feet ceiling and 3 miles visibility (2 miles if under radar contact), whichever is higher. 2.  200 feet Height Above Touchdown (HAT) or Decision Height (DH)/Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) for the approach being flown, whichever is higher. 3.  Comply with the following if a touch-and-go is to be accomplished: Touch-and-go limitations apply. Rudder trim must be centered when decision is made to land. If performing a single loss on takeoff, following the 6 engine landing, comply with restrictions for the single engine loss on takeoff in this table. If unplanned go-around is executed, symmetrical thrust will be established on all engines. 4.  Dry runway crosswind component is 10 knots maximum. Touchdown must be made in the first third of the runway or go-around will be initiated. 5.  200 feet AGL to make decision to land or go-around. 6.  Discernible horizon and the end of the runway visible.  AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 101 Attachment 6 C-5 OPERATING PROCEDURES A6.1.  General  Information.  This  attachment,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives, outlines procedures for operation of the C-5 aircraft under most circumstances.  AFMC aircrews and  all  management  levels  concerned  with  operation  of  all  C-5  aircraft  must  comply  with  the outlined  requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this  attachment.    Operations  or procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished  if  they  enhance  safe,  effective mission accomplishment.  Refer to AFI 11-2C-5V3 for operations specific to the C-5A/B/C. A6.2.  Mission Planning. A6.2.1.  Obstacle  Clearance  Planning.  Use  AFI  11-202V3,  AFMAN  11-217V1,  and  this instruction  when  planning  an  IFR  departure.  The  Aircraft  Commander  shall  provide  the engineer  with  the  following;  planned  IFR  departure  procedure,  takeoff  runway  direction, length,  slope,  RCR/RSC,  screen  height,  the  height  and  distance  of  any  known  obstacles affecting departure path, and climb gradients (OEI and four engine). A6.2.2.  Fuel Planning. On flights where a test plan does not dictate required fuel load, fuel planning is the responsibility of the aircraft commander.  Utilize T.O. 1C-5M-1-1, Chapter 11 for fuel planning. A6.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A6.3.1.  Taxi Procedures.  Refer to Table A6.1 for taxi clearance criteria. Table A6.1.  Minimum Taxi Clearance Criteria. Lateral clearance of component   Main Gear Pod Outboard Nacelle Wing Tip To an obstacle  Less than 3 feet high 3 feet high, but less than 6 feet high 6 feet or higher Without Wing Walker With Wing Walker   25 feet 25 feet 25 feet   10 feet 10 feet 10 feet A6.3.2.  Aircrew Engine Running On-load/Offload/Crew change (ERO/ERCC). Aircrew will apply  these  procedures  when  conducting  ERO/ERCCs  through  the  crew  entrance  door. Crews should spend a minimum amount of time on the ground when accomplishing an ERO or  ERCC.  Aircraft  commanders  will  brief  crewmembers  on  the  intended  ERO/ERCC operation. The parking brake will be set and at least one pilot in the seat will monitor brakes, aircraft systems, interphone, and command radio. Prior to landing, the loadmaster or scanner will  brief  personnel  in  the  cargo  compartment  regarding  their  locations,  duties,  and responsibilities  during the  ERO/ERCC.  During  enplaning  or  deplaning,  station  a crewmember on interphone (cord held taut) at approximately 20-30 feet and 45 degrees from the  aircraft  axis  to  establish  a  visual  reference  between  personnel  and  the  running  engines. No deplaning/enplaning personnel should approach the airplane until this crewmember is in place.  Brief  deplaning/enplaning  personnel  to  remain  forward  of  the  interphone  cord  and ensure hearing protection is used. Use wing leading edge lights, taxi lights, and landing lights to enhance safety at night as the situation dictates. 102 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A6.3.3.  Observer.  Use  available  crewmembers  to  assist  in  outside  clearing  during  all  taxi operations and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL. A6.3.4.  Landing  Gear  and  Flap  Operating  Guidance.  The  pilot  flying  (PF)  will  command configuration  changes.  The  pilot  monitoring  (PM)  will  verify  appropriate  airspeed  and configuration prior to echoing the gear or flap actuation command. All gear operation will be activated by the pilot in the right seat and all in-flight flap operation will be activated by the PM.  During touch-and-go operations, an instructor pilot (either PF or PM) will operate the flaps. A6.3.5.  Flight  Engineer  Procedures.  All  flight  engineers  assigned  to  AFMC  will  use  the following  guidance  when  operating  C-5s,  regardless  of  location.  This  guidance  contains normal procedures for flight engineers (FE) not contained in the flight manual or applicable technical orders (TO). A6.3.5.1.  Authority to Clear a Red X.  If a situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are not available to clear it, the highest qualified flight engineer on scene may obtain authorization to sign off the Red X from the applicable  MXG/CC  or  designated  representative,  in  accordance  with  T.O.  00-20-1. Other crew members are not authorized to clear a Red X. Exception: The flight engineer may  clear  Red  Xs  for  pitot  covers,  gear  pins,  engine  cowls,  access  panels,  throttle  lock plate,  NLG  steering  manifold  input  arm,  and  single  point  refueling  (SPR)  drains  when qualified  maintenance  personnel  are  not  available,  unless  prohibited  by  the  applicable MXG/CC or OG/CC. A6.3.5.2.  Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. The flight engineer is qualified and authorized to accomplish these duties when maintenance personnel are not available. This guidance  is  designed  for  support  of  the  aircraft  and  its  mission  while  away  from  home station.  The  applicable  refueling  and  de-fueling  checklists  will  be  used  during  all refueling  and  de-fueling  operations.  If  ground  support  personnel  are  not  available,  the aircraft  commander  will  designate  other  crewmembers  to  assist  the  flight  engineer.  A flight engineer may assist the normal maintenance function when critical taskings dictate their use Exception: Flight Engineers will not service Nitrogen or Oxygen. WARNING: Do  not  load/off-load  cargo  containing  explosives,  oxygen,  flammable  gases  or  liquids during fuel servicing operations. A6.3.5.3.  Fuel  Servicing  Operations.  Unless  servicing  JP-4,  simultaneous  servicing  of fuel  while  loading  passengers,  cargo,  performing  maintenance,  aircrew  members performing  inspections,  or  operating  aircraft  systems  is  considered  to  be  a  normal  fuel servicing operation. If refueling/defueling with JP-4 Concurrent Servicing operations are IAW  TO  00-25-172,  Ground  Servicing  of  Aircraft  and  Static required Grounding/Bonding.  Aircrew  members  qualified  in  ground  refueling  may  perform  fuel servicing  duties.  Aircrews  will  only  refuel  in  cases  when  maintenance  support  is  not readily  available  and  the  mission  would  be  delayed.  Flight  Engineers  are  qualified  in ground refueling operations. A6.3.5.3.1.  When aircrew members are required to refuel, the flight engineer will act as  the  refueling  team  supervisor.  Flight  engineers  will  comply  with  T.O.  00-25-172 and applicable T.O. series when acting as refueling supervisor and panel operators. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 103 A6.3.5.4.  Concurrent Ground Operations. The PIC and chief servicing supervisor (CSS) shall  ensure  aircrew  members  and  servicing  personnel  accomplish  concurrent  servicing (CS)  in  accordance  with  T.O.  00-25-172  and  servicing  technical  orders.  Aircrews performing Dash-1 preflight inspections or cargo loading concurrent with servicing must have  cooperation  and  close  coordination  with  the  CSS.  The  CSS  will  remain  in continuous intercom contact with fuel servicing team members during the entire servicing operation.  Team  members  include  CSS,  a  monitor  for  each  SPR  in  use,  refueling  panel monitor, fuel specialists. When the aircrew is at the aircraft, the PIC is responsible for all aspects  of  aircraft  operations  and  shall  inform  the  CSS  how  aircrew  members  will participate in passenger evacuation/safety. In keeping with the guidelines in T.O. 00-25-172,  CSS  has  authority  over  all  phases  of  CS  operations  to  include  personnel participating in the refuel. A6.3.5.4.1.  Designate  a  current  and  qualified  maintenance  personnel  or  aircrew member  to  remain  on  the  flight  deck  to  monitor  interphone  and  be  prepared  to broadcast  a  request  for  emergency  assistance  on  a  radio  tuned  to  the  appropriate agency with ready access to an emergency response team anytime aircrew members are in the aircraft and fuel servicing is being conducted. The PA may be used to direct passenger evacuation in an emergency. A6.3.5.4.2.  Unless environmental conditions dictate, the primary emergency exit will remain open and stairs/ladders in place. A6.3.5.5.  The following guidance will be used for fuel servicing (refuel) operations: A6.3.5.5.1.  Electric  and  electronic  equipment  may  be  on  and  operated  to  include operations  performed  by  aircrew  members  during  required  inspections  with  the following exceptions: A6.3.5.5.2.  TACANs and radar altimeters must be turned off. A6.3.5.5.3.  Radar will be in STBY, TEST, or OFF. A6.3.5.5.4.  IFF may be in standby but, if time permits, should be turned off. A6.3.5.5.5.  Radio  operations  are  authorized.  Exception:  Use  of  HF  radios  is prohibited. A6.3.5.6.  Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized. A6.3.5.7.  APU‘s and ATM‘s may be used. A6.3.6.  Weight  and  Balance.  The  flight  engineer  performing  scanner  duties  is  responsible for  completing  the  DD  Form  365-4,  Weight  and  Balance  Clearance  Form  F,  when loadmasters are not on board and/or one has not been done through other means (i.e.- Canned DD Form 365-4, etc.). A6.3.7.  Aircraft  Structural  Integrity  Program.  The  purpose  of  this  program  is  to  provide  a reliable system  for predicting potential  or impending failures based on historical records of the aircraft's exposure to those actions contributing to fatigue failures. A6.3.7.1.  The  C-5M  Aircraft  Structural  Integrity  Program  is  automated  in  the  EDS.  C-5M Flight Engineer’s will: 104 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A6.3.7.1.1.  Ensure  all  applicable  tabs  are  completed  within  the  EDS  program according to procedures in paragraph A6.3.8. A6.3.7.2.  Use the AF IMT 4097 and the procedures in AFI11-2C-5V3 during operations with a failed PCIU, AMC, or when deemed necessary. A6.3.7.3.  When  returning  aircraft  to  home  station  remove  the  RMM  and  turn  into maintenance debrief. Note: If the crew and maintenance do not conduct a formal debrief (e.g. debrief not available), the RMM will be left on the aircraft. A6.3.8.  EDS Instructions. A6.3.8.1.  Complete the applicable data input for each sortie. Do not  complete input for any ground operation or sortie that does not involve an attempted takeoff. This includes ground  aborts  for  maintenance,  operations,  weather,  and  on  load  or  offload  exercises. When a sortie is terminated before an attempted takeoff, complete the applicable sections to document crew actions. A6.3.8.2.  Start-up and initialization. This data is entered and will be used to pre-populate additional  fields.  The  flight  engineer  name  shall  be  entered  using  first  name  initial,  full last name, and rank. DSN phone number shall be used as the military employee number. Enter the initial takeoff and final landing airfield ICAO designations. A6.3.8.3.  Log  start.  Select  the  log  start  event  and  enter  the  basic  operating  weight  and cargo  weight  obtained  from  DD  Form  365-4  Weight  and  Balance  Clearance  Form  F- Transport/Tactical or the automated Form F. Also enter the cumulative airframe hours as depicted  in  the  AFTO  Form  781-series.  Note:  Load  Environmental  Spectra  Survey (LESS)  equipped  aircraft  -  fuel  weights  are  prefilled  for  automatically  detected  events when the LESS circuit breakers are closed. A6.3.8.4.  Take off. Select the takeoff event from the tab and document the gross weight (zero fuel weight plus fuel weight), center of gravity, and fuel weight as of brake release. Annotate with a check mark if the takeoff is accomplished on a substandard runway. A6.3.8.5.  Cruise.  If  not  automatically  detected  after  15  minutes  when  above  6,000  feet MSL or 5 minutes when at or below 6,000 feet MSL, manually enter a cruise event and document the start time, stop time, Mach and altitude. Use the remarks section to identify abnormal cruise conditions. A6.3.8.6.  Fuel jettison. Record the incremental weight offloaded, Mach and altitude. A6.3.8.7.  Touchdown.  Record the fuel  weight  upon landing for  full stop  landings. This event also provides the capability to record a landing on a substandard runway or flights using  nonstandard  fuel  sequencing.  For  touch  and  go  operations,  the  fuel  load  entry  is optional for each touchdown event logged. Use the remarks section to enter appropriate comments  that  could  influence  aircraft  fatigue  factors.  Examples  are:  unpressurized flight,  severe load  maneuvers  and unpressurized flight. turbulence  encountered,  hard landing,  high A6.3.8.8.  Engine  start,  ALDCS,  taxi,  lift  off,  gear  cycle,  new  flight,  engine  shutdown and  log  stop.  These  are  additional  automatic  events  that  do  not  require  attention  unless abnormal conditions occur. Use the remarks section to identify abnormal conditions. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 105 A6.3.8.9.  Runway aborts. Select the runway abort event and then enter the reason for the rejected take off. A6.3.8.10.  Over-g.  Select  the  over-g  event  and  enter  relevant  information  about  the exceedance condition. A6.3.8.11.  After documenting the required information within each event details viewer, the save button shall be selected to record the data onto the RMM. A6.3.9.  Fault Code Reporting Procedures: A6.3.9.1.  The  Fault  Reporting  Method  (FRM)  is  used  to  isolate  system  malfunctions with a minimum amount of troubleshooting and provide a description of the malfunction for maintenance. A6.3.9.2.  System malfunctions, monitored by EDS auto or manual faults or observed by a  crewmember,  will  be  troubleshot  using  the  Fault  Reporting  Method  (FRM)  or  Fault Isolation Manual (FIM) procedures contained in EDS to maximum extent possible. A6.3.9.3.  The manual  fault code (FC) derived from  the troubleshooting routine and the auto fault code reported will be recorded in AFTO Form 781A along with the description of  the  malfunction.  Include  any  additional  information  required  for  clarification  of  the discrepancy. A6.3.9.4.  When  documenting  EDS  faults,  AFTO  Form  781A  discrepancies  shall  be based on the fault isolation (FI) and include reference to the fault detection (FD). If the FD does not have a FI, the AFTO Form 781A entry shall be based on the FD. A6.3.9.5.  Before  finalizing  the  flight  during  EDS  shutdown,  the  flight  engineer  shall evaluate each active fault  to  determine its validity. To facilitate evaluation of recovered faults, select the event log and review each fault occurring after the MFDU fault log reset during  the  preflight.  After  eliminating  any  induced  and/or  nuisance  faults,  ensure  all actual  faults  are  recorded  in  the  AFTO  Form  781A.  A  comprehensive  list  of  nuisance faults can be found in the current AMC Checklist Inserts. A6.3.10.  Monitoring  Primary  Radios.  The  FE  will  monitor  the  primary  radio  for  flight clearances, altitudes, heading changes, and radio frequencies. The FE is not required to copy departure clearances. A6.3.11.  Scanner Duties. After takeoff, the scanner will normally make a walk-around when flaps  are  retracted,  the  after-takeoff  climb  checklist  has  been  initiated,  and  the  airplane  is clear of turbulence. The walk-around should be completed by 10,000 feet. Exception: When the  scanner  is  sitting  in  the  jump  seat,  he  or  she  will  remain  there  until  10,000  ft.,  unless coordinated with the pilot to clear off earlier for the after takeoff climb scan. A6.3.12.  Wheel  and  Brake  Procedures.  If  dragging  wheels  or  brakes  are  suspected  during taxi, or after the Anti-Skid check, deplane the scanner and another crewmember, if available, and proceed as follows. A6.3.12.1.  Maintain interphone contact throughout the inspection. A6.3.12.2.  To  inspect,  approach  directly  from  the  front  or  rear  of  the  tire,  touch  main landing  gear  tire  and  cautiously  move  the  hand  toward  the  wheel.  Then  place  the  hand 106 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 near the brake to determine excessive heat without touching the brake surface. Repeat for each main landing gear (MLG) wheel and brake assembly. A6.3.12.3.  If any brake is significantly hotter than the majority, advise maintenance that corrective action is required. If an obviously dangerous overheated condition is observed, do not taxi the airplane. A6.3.12.4.  If no brake is found significantly hotter than the majority of brakes, the brake check is satisfactory. A6.3.12.5.  In Flight Procedures: A6.3.12.5.1.  Inspect the MLG wheel wells after takeoff for evidence of heat, smoke, or fire. If abnormalities are detected, extend the landing gear immediately at or below 250 KCAS/.60 Mach. A6.3.12.5.2.  Inspect the cargo compartment sidewall and floor areas adjacent to the MLG  wheel  wells  for  evidence  of  heat  (discoloration  or  variation  in  surface temperature) at 15-minute intervals for the first hour of flight. Inspect hourly for the remainder of flight A6.3.13.  PCIU Failure.  To allow data recovery  after a PCIU failure, attempt to  replace the PCIU prior to AMC power down. If the PCIU is not replaced prior to power down, the AMC will store all data except the .dat files created for that flight (i.e. aircraft form entries). A6.3.13.1.  Operations  with  a  failed  PCIU  result  in  the  loss  of  or  inability  to  auto generate  AFTO  form  781A  entries.  When  operating  with  a  failed  PCIU,  the  MFDU should be used as a reference to ensure accurate manual documentation of all AFTO form 781A entries. The flight summary report can be printed and taken to debrief if required. A6.3.13.2.  During  operations  with  a  failed  PCIU  the  FE  shall  annotate  in  the  aircraft forms,  all  Thrust  Reverser  deployments  including  airspeed/groundspeed  at  time  of deployment.  For  example;  Engine 1, 2, 3,  and 4  TRs  deployed on landing  airspeed 110 knots.  If deployment is  during  ground operations, indicate  engine operation  at  or  above idle. For example #1 Eng. TR deployed for op ck, ground speed 0, throttle at idle. A6.3.13.3.  The EDS Aircraft Structural  Integrity Program  is  not  fully  functional  with  a failed PCIU. Use the AF IMT 4097 for all flights with a failed PCIU. A6.3.14.  AMC Failure. Operations with a failed AMC will be held to a minimum. A6.3.14.1.  During  operations  with  a  failed  AMC  the  FE  shall  annotate  in  the  aircraft forms,  all  Thrust  Reverser  deployments  including  airspeed/groundspeed  at  time  of deployment. For example; Engine 2 and 3 TRs deployed on descent airspeed 230 knots. If deployment is during ground operations, indicate engine operation at or above idle. For example #1 and #4 Eng. TR deployed for op ck, ground speed 0, engine throttles idle. A6.3.14.2.  The EDS Aircraft Structural  Integrity Program  is  not  fully  functional  with  a failed AMC. Use the AF IMT 4097 for all flights with a failed AMC. A6.3.14.3.  RMM  Failure.  If  the  RMM  card  fails  prior  to  data  download,  attempt  to replace  the  card  prior  to  power  down  of  the  EDS  and  PCIU.  If  replacement  is  not practical  all  AFTO  form  781A  entries,  TLDs,  and  exceedances  must  be  reviewed  and entered in the aircraft forms as appropriate. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 107 A6.3.15.  Runway,  Taxiway,  and  Airfield  Requirements.  In  all  cases  ensure    obstacle clearance  requirements  are  met.  Computed  landing  distance  will  not  exceed  runway available. A6.3.15.1.  Runway Length for Takeoff/Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, takeoffs will be initiated  from  the  beginning  of  the  approved  usable  portion  of  the  runway.  Decision  to make  intersection  takeoffs  rests  solely  with  the  AC.  Intersection  takeoffs  may  be accomplished provided the operating environment (i.e. gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria,  weather,  etc.)  will  allow  safe  takeoff  and  departure.  When  less  than  the  entire runway  is  used,  takeoff  and  landing  data  (TOLD)  card  computations  will  be  based  on actual runway remaining from the point at which takeoff is initiated. A6.3.16.  Arresting Cables. A6.3.16.1.  Do  not  land  on  (touchdown  on)  approach  end  arresting  cables  (does  not include recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower to have the cable inspected. A6.3.16.2.  Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as slack,  loose,  or  improperly  rigged  by  NOTAM,  automated  terminal  information  service (ATIS), or ATC. A6.3.17.  Aircraft Recovery from  Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews  will  not  normally  attempt to  recover  an  aircraft  after  inadvertent  entry  onto  unprepared  surfaces  not  suitable  for  taxi; ground crews will accomplish aircraft recovery. installed  on the  aircraft. A6.3.18.  MA-1 Portable Oxygen Bottles.  Ensure a minimum of two unmodified/modified2 bottles  are least  one unmodified/modified2 bottle is placed on the flight deck, forward of the #1 escape hatch and one  unmodified/modified2  bottle  is  placed  in  the  center  of  the  cargo  compartment.    In  the event  that  the  crew  consists  of  loadmasters,  the  aircraft  commander  should  ensure  a minimum of four unmodified/modified2 bottles are installed on the aircraft.   During  preflight,  ensure  at A6.4.  Instrument Procedures. A6.4.1.  Aircraft Category.  The C-5 is approach Category D.  If approach speed exceeds 165 knots, the minimums for Category E will be used. A6.4.2.  Data  Insertion.  Another  pilot  will  verify  flight  plan  or  waypoint  data  inserted  into the FMS/MCDU. Check the coordinate information and/or the distances between waypoints against the route of flight. A6.4.3.  Use of Automation. A6.4.3.1.  In flight, the PF will determine the most desirable level of automation for the given  situation.  However,  the  PIC  still  has  the  ultimate  responsibility  and  authority  for the safe operation of the aircraft. A6.4.3.2.  One  pilot  should  always  remain  heads  up.  One  technique  is  to  announce ―pilot heads down‖ or ―copilot heads down‖ when the task requires focusing significant attention on the FMS/MCDU in flight. A6.4.3.3.  Extensive  programming  of  the  FMS/MCDU  below  10,000  feet  and  during critical phases of flight should be avoided, especially during times of increased workload. 108 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A6.4.3.4.  To maximize situational awareness, the PF should verbalize automation mode and level changes to the crew. Confirm inputs by observing the desired result. A6.4.3.5.  Any system which increases situational awareness, such as EGPWS, TCAS or WX radar, should be operated by the PM at the direction of the PF. A6.4.4.  Avionics Operations. A6.4.4.1.  Normally  the  PM  will  make  MCDU  inputs,  especially  at  low  altitudes  (e.g. below 10,000 feet). Changes which alter the flight path should be verified by the PF prior to execution. A6.4.4.2.  AFCS operation is governed by the autopilot status with consideration given to aircraft altitude. A6.4.4.2.1.  With  the  autopilot  engaged,  the  PF  should  make  all  changes  to  AFCS modes and settings, unless directed otherwise by the PF. A6.4.4.2.2.  With  the  autopilot  disengaged,  the  PM  should  make  all  AFCS  inputs  at the  direction  of  the  PF.  However,  when  receiving  ATC  vectors  or  altitude  change clearances, the PM should set assigned headings or set the new altitude and await the PF‘s instructions to engage HDG SEL mode or a vertical mode. A6.4.5.  The following standard terminology will be used: A6.4.5.1.  SELECT, SET or ENGAGE directs the selection of a value and/or a mode on the  AFCS  panel  which  results  in  the  value  being  placed  in  the  ―engaged‖  (top  green) portion  of  the  FMA.  SELECT  or  SET  is  normally  used  with  rotary  knobs,  however ENGAGE is acceptable. A6.4.5.2.  ARM directs the selection of a mode on the AFCS panel which results in the value being in the ―armed‖ (bottom, cyan) portion of an FMA. A6.4.5.3.  ENGAGE should be used to request autopilot or autothrottle engagement. A6.4.5.4.  UP or DOWN should be used to indicate a change in vertical speed. A6.4.5.5.  EXECUTE should be used by the PF to indicate agreement with a programmed change to the flight path. A6.4.5.6.  PRESET  or  PRESELECT  should  be  used  to  change  an  AFCS  value  without changing the engaged or armed mode. A6.4.6.  Autopilot  and  Auto-throttle  Use.  C-5M  auto-throttles  are  approved  for  use  during climb, cruise, descent, and approach. A6.4.6.1.  The  autopilot  will  be  disconnected  no  later  than  DH,  departing  the  MDA,  or 300' for visual approaches. A6.4.6.2.  The  auto-throttles  will  be  disconnected  no  later  than  DH  or  100'  at  all  other times. A6.5.  Operational Procedures and Restrictions. A6.5.1.  Passenger Procedures. The aircraft commander has the discretion to release seats for passenger  accommodations.  Passengers  can  be  carried  on  the  flight  station  (jump  seat  or navigator‘s  seat),  in  the  relief  crew  area,  or  in  the  courier  compartment.      Any  additional AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 109 members  on  the  aircraft  must  have  an  oxygen  source  and  a  seat/seat  belt  for  all  phases  of flight and ground operations. One additional current and qualified C-5 crewmember must be on  board  when  carrying  passengers  other  than  on  the  flight  deck.  This  crewmember  will perform  only  passenger-related  duties.  Passengers  will  not  normally  be  carried  in  the  troop compartment.  If  passengers  are  carried  in  the  troop  compartment,  obtain  qualified loadmasters  and  reference  AMC  guidance  contained  in  AFI  11-2C-5,  Volume  3  for  any specific requirements. A6.5.2.  Cargo  procedures.  Cargo  will  not  normally  be  carried.  If  cargo  is  carried,  obtain qualified loadmasters and reference AMC guidance contained in AFI 11-2C-5, Volume 3 for any specific requirements. Parachute racks, survival equipment and a single B-1 stand are not considered  cargo.  Ballast  for  SCM-modified  aircraft  is  not  considered  cargo.  Small  items capable of being hand-carried up the crew entrance ladder are also not considered cargo. A6.5.3.  Wind  Restrictions.  Airfields  will  be  considered  below  minimums  for  takeoff  and landing when winds (including gusts) are greater than: Maximum wind (any direction)—50 knots;  Maximum  tailwind  component—10  knots;  Maximum  crosswind  components, corrected for RCR, are specified in TO 1C-5M-1-1. A6.5.4.  Prohibited Maneuvers. The following maneuvers are prohibited in the aircraft unless they are part of an approved test plan or aircraft recovery plan: A6.5.4.1.  Simulated/actual engine out takeoffs. A6.5.4.2.  Aborted takeoffs. A6.5.4.3.  Two engine out landings and missed approaches. A6.5.4.4.  Stop and go landings. A6.5.4.5.  No slat landings (unless associated with no-flap landings). A6.5.4.6.  Full stalls. A6.5.4.7.  Dutch rolls. A6.5.4.8.  Unusual attitudes / spatial disorientation training. A6.5.4.9.  Simulated runaway pitch trim malfunctions. A6.5.5.  Training Restrictions. A6.5.5.1.  No  Flap  Landing.    Perform  no  flap  landings  to  a  full  stop  only.  Maximum crosswind  component  will  not  exceed  15  knots.  Limit  gross  weight  to  525,000  lbs.  or less. A6.5.5.2.  Stallimeter  Training.  All  practice  approach  to  shaker  onset/audible  warning must  be  done  in  day,  VMC  only  conditions  at  an  altitude  greater  than  10,000  ft.  AGL with an instructor pilot in the left or right seat. A6.5.5.2.1.  For  practice  approach  to  shaker  onset,  recover  the  airplane  at  shaker onset  or  the  lowest  acceptable  computed  shaker  onset  airspeed,  whichever  occurs first. 110 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A6.5.5.2.2.  For practice approach to audible warning, recover the airplane at audible warning or the highest acceptable computed audible warning AOA, whichever occurs first. Table A6.2.

Redundant  systems  may  allow  crews  to  safely  perform  some missions when a component/system is degraded. The Pilot in Command (PIC) is the final authority in determining the overall suitability of an aircraft for the mission. The PIC will ensure  a  detailed  explanation  of  the  discrepancy  is  entered  in  the  AFTO  Form  781A, Maintenance  Discrepancy  and  Work  Document;  include  the  following  maintenance identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft status: A6.5.6.1.1.  Mission  Essential  (ME).  The  PIC  will  designate  an  item,  system,  or subsystem  component  essential  for  safe  aircraft  operation  or  mission  completion  as ME. A6.5.6.1.2.  Mission  Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item,  system, or subsystem  component,  which  is  not  currently  essential  for  safe  aircraft  operation  as MC.  These  discrepancies  should  be  cleared  at  the  earliest  opportunity.  If circumstances change or mission safety would be compromised, re-designate as ME. Do not delay a mission to clear a MC discrepancy. A6.5.6.1.3.  Open  Item  (OI).  The  PIC  will  designate  discrepancies  not  expected  to adversely impact the current mission or any subsequent mission as an OI. These items are normally cleared at home station. A6.5.6.1.4.  Time Limited Dispatch (TLD). TLD level A faults are ME. TLD level B and level C are initially designated OI. Level B and level C conditions are designated ME  at  repair  capable  facilities  when  time  remaining  is  insufficient  for  mission completion. Designate level D faults as OI. TLD limits are contained in T.O. 1C-5M-1.  TLD  faults  that  display  a  NOT  ACTIVE  status  are  still  considered  real  faults because the condition which triggered the fault may not always be present. A6.5.6.2.  Minimum  Equipment  List  (MEL)  Guidance.  Command  operating  guidelines list  the  equipment  and  systems  normally  considered  essential  for  routine,  non-FCF AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 111 operations.  This  list  is  not  inclusive  of  all  equipment  or  systems  essential  to airworthiness.    The  aircraft  commander  is  the  approving  authority  for  operations  with degraded  equipment  and  needs  no  further  approval.  This  section  provides  guidance  on how  to  operate  with  inoperative/degraded  equipment.  The  Minimum  Equipment  List (MEL)  shall  not  direct  deviation  from  the  aircraft  flight  manual  limitations,  emergency procedures  or  USAF/AFMC  directives.  A  PIC  who  accepted  an  aircraft  with  degraded equipment/systems  is  not  committed  to  subsequent  operations  with  the  same  degraded equipment.  PICs are not committed to  operations with  degraded equipment  accepted by another PIC. If, after exploring all options, the aircraft commander determines that a safe flight  is  possible  with  an  item  listed  below  inoperative  (beyond  the  scope  listed  here)  a waiver shall be requested through channels to AFMC/A3V.

General  Information.  This  attachment,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives, outlines  procedures  for  operation  of  the  C-12  aircraft  under  most  circumstances.    AFMC aircrews and all management levels  concerned with operation of all C-12 aircraft must comply with  the  outlined  requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this  attachment. Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment. A7.2.  Mission Planning. A7.2.1.  Briefing/Debriefing. A7.2.1.1.  Conduct C-12 Paradrop mission briefings with a qualified jumpmaster.  Begin briefings NLT 1 hour prior to scheduled takeoff.  C-12J will not conduct actual Paradrop missions. A7.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A7.3.1.  Aircrew should  avoid  MC-12 taxi,  takeoff, or landing over  any  ground obstruction or obstacle (arresting cable, tie down cable etc.).  Damage may result due to low clearance of the L-3 faring.  High-speed taxi over ground obstructions, obstacles, or cables is prohibited due to possible L-3 faring damage. A7.3.2.  Taxi.  Instructor pilots may run engines and taxi the aircraft, as a single pilot. A7.3.2.1.  Reverse Taxi. A7.3.2.1.1.  The pilot will coordinate reverse taxi directions and signals with the crew chief, marshaller or scanner (any qualified C-12 aircrew member). A7.3.2.1.2.  The  crew  chief  or  scanner  will  be  outside  the  aircraft  and  positioned  to effectively direct the reverse taxi. A7.3.2.1.3.  The  reverse  motion  should  be  stopped  using  forward  thrust  before  the brakes  are  applied  in  order  to  prevent  the  aircraft  empennage  from  contacting  the ground. A7.3.3.  Takeoff/Landing Requirements. A7.3.3.1.  Compute  takeoff  and  landing  data  for  all  flights.    OG/CC-approved  tab  data may be used when available. A7.3.3.1.1.  Compute MC-12 takeoff and landing data utilizing section 5 of the FAA approved  Pilot  Operating  Handbook  (POH).    Use  Special  Departure  Procedures (SDP)  to  the  maximum  extent  for  MC-12  Maximum  Takeoff  Weight  (MTOW) departures. A7.3.3.2.  C-12  Minimum  Runway  Length.    Runway  available  for  takeoff  must  exceed Accelerate-Stop distance plus 500 ft., computed without reverse and corrected for RCR.  On  runways  with  a  screen  height  requirement,  runway  available  must  also  exceed Accelerate-Go[J]/Accelerate After Lift-Off[C/D] computed to the specified screen height (normally 35 ft.).  Runway available for landing must exceed landing distance plus 500 134 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 feet,  computed  without  reverse  from  a  50-foot  obstacle  and  corrected  for  RCR.  Minimum runway for a touch and go is 5000 ft. for the C-12C/D and MC-12 and 6000 ft. for the C-12J. A7.3.3.3.  MC-12 minimum runway length is Takeoff Field Length (TOFL) derived from the FAA approved POH. A7.3.3.4.  Crosswind Limitations – reference Table A7.1. Table A7.1.  Crosswind Limitations. RCR Values Maximum Crosswind Component 6 10 7 12 8 15 9 17 10 20 11 22 12 and above 25 A7.3.4.  Chase  Operations.    Chase  operations  are  defined  as  flights  involving  similar  or dissimilar  aircraft  performing  maneuvers  with  a  “non-cooperative”  lead  aircraft  (i.e. moderate banked turns, shallow climbs, and descents) from a route or trail position. A7.3.4.1.  Chase Restrictions. A7.3.4.1.1.  Day VMC only. A7.3.4.1.2.  No wing takeoff or landings. A7.3.4.1.3.  Minimum  ATC  wake  turbulence  criteria  applies  when  chasing  larger aircraft. A7.3.4.1.4.  Minimum  lateral  spacing  is  one-half  the  wingspan  of  the  largest participating aircraft. A7.3.5.  Airdrop Procedures. The C-12J is prohibited from airdrop operations.  The C-12C is authorized  to  airdrop  personnel  out  of  the  rear  main  cabin  entry  door.    The  following guidelines apply: A7.3.5.1.  Maximum airspeed is 205 knots with the airstart door removed. A7.3.5.2.  Normal  airdrop  configuration  is  40%  flaps  or  100%  flaps  and  gear  as necessary.  0% flaps may be used for dummy drops where faster airspeed is desired. A7.3.5.3.  Minimum airspeed is 100 knots with flaps 40% or 90 knots with flaps 100%. A7.3.5.4.  A loadmaster is not required to be on board the aircraft when the jumpmaster is from the AFTC test parachute program. A7.3.5.5.  The minimum exit altitude for free fall is 2500 ft. AGL. A7.3.5.6.  The minimum emergency exit altitude is 1000 ft. AGL. A7.3.5.7.  Below  1000  feet  AGL  all  airdrop  personnel  will  have  lap  belts  securely fastened. A7.4.  Instrument Procedures. A7.4.1.  The C-12 is approach category C. A7.4.2.  The  MC-12  is  approach  category  B.    If  approach  speeds  exceed  120  KIAS,  use category C approach minimums. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 135 A7.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A7.5.1.  Maneuvering Parameters. A7.5.1.1.  Unusual  Attitudes.    Perform  unusual  attitudes  at  an  altitude  that  will  allow recovery  not  lower  than  5,000  ft.  AGL  and  avoid  exceeding  bank  angles  of  60  degrees and pitch attitudes of + 25 degrees. A7.5.1.2.  Stall  Characteristics.    Recover  the  aircraft  at  the  first  indication  of  stall warning  or  actual  stall  during  stall  demonstrations.    During  stall  training  under  an approved  syllabus,  instructor  pilots  may  allow  the  trainee  to  recover  the  aircraft  at  the first indication of aerodynamic stall.  Perform all practice stalls and stall recoveries above 5,000 ft. AGL. A7.5.1.3.  Practice Engine Shutdown/Restarts.  Actual engine shutdowns and restarts for practice will only be accomplished during training under an approved training syllabus or during  FCF  proficiency  training  with  the  restrictions  imposed  by  Table  5.2.    Prior  to engine shutdown, the pilot in command will verify that the altitude for the planned engine shutdown does not exceed the single engine service ceiling. A7.5.1.4.  Simulated  Engine  Failure  Immediately  After  Takeoff.    Simulated  engine failures immediately after takeoff may only be performed after a positive rate of climb is attained,  the  aircraft  is  above  the  safe  single  engine  airspeed  defined  in  the  appropriate flight  manual,  and  the  aircraft  is  capable  of  meeting  the  published  climb  gradient  or  at least a 3.3% single engine climb gradient (200 ft./NM), if not published. A7.5.1.4.1.  Do not  initiate MC-12 simulated engine failure below 500’ AGL.  MC-12 simulated engine-out power will be IAW the FAA approved POH procedures for Simulated One-Engine Inoperative (zero thrust). A7.5.1.5.  C-12  No  Flap  Landings/Touch  and  Goes.    C-12s  have  no  restrictions  on  No Flap landings or touch and goes.  This is a normal flap setting and may be accomplished without an IP or EP. A7.5.1.5.1.  C-12 Touch and Goes.  Without a C-12 qualified IP or EP onboard, both MPs  must  be  MP  Touch  and  Go  certified  in  order  to  perform  actual  touch  and  go events in the aircraft. A7.5.1.6.  MC-12  No  Flap  Landings/Touch  and  Go’s.    Due  to  possible  L-3  faring damage, do not accomplish MC-12 no flap landings or touch and goes except in an actual emergency.  136 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 Attachment 8 C-17 OPERATING PROCEDURES A8.1.  General  Information.  This  attachment,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives, outlines  procedures  for  operation  of  the  C-17  aircraft  under  most  circumstances.    AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all C-17A aircraft must comply with  the  outlined  requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this  attachment.   Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment. A8.2.  Mission Planning. A8.2.1.  Aircrew Publication Requirements In Flight.  In accordance with Table A8.1. Table A8.1.  Aircrew Publications Requirements In Flight. PUBLICATION PILOT LM TO 1C-17A-1 TO 1C-17A-1-1 TO 1C-17A-1-2 TO 1C-17A-1-4     Abbreviated Checklist X AFI11-2FTV3 (w/ A10 only) TO 1C-17A-9 TO 1C-17A-1(-9,-5-1,-5-2) Modification Flight Manual    A8.3.  Common Mission Guidance.     X    AIRCRAFT PUBS KIT X X X X X X X X   A8.3.1.  Functional/Acceptance Check Flights.  FCFs and ACFs will be performed according to  T.O.  1-1-300  and  applicable  MAJCOM  instructions  (i.e.,  21-XXX  series).    Additional guidance can be found in T.O.s 00-20-6, 1C-17A-6CF-1 and 1C-17A-1. A8.3.2.  Formation  Procedures.    Visual  formation,  to  include  chase  and  target  support,  is authorized with similar and dissimilar aircraft.  Station Keeping Equipment (SKE)/Formation Flight System (FFS) formation will be flown in accordance with lead-command guidance to the maximum extent possible. A8.3.3.  NVG Procedures A8.3.3.1.  NVG Donning/Doffing.  Donning and doffing of NVGs will be initiated by the aircraft  commander  as  briefed.    For  non-NVG  landings,  cease  NVG  usage  5  minutes prior  to  activity  to  regain  adequate  night  visual  acuity.    NVGs  used  for  general  SA (thunderstorm avoidance, traffic call-outs) are not restricted. A8.3.3.2.  Takeoff  and  Landing  Requirements.    Use  airfield  marking  patterns  IAW  AFI 13-217 appropriate to  runway conditions.   Preflight  study of the  airfield  environment  is key for successful NVG visual approaches. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 137 A8.3.3.3.  Slowdown  through  Escape  (airdrop  only).    If  either  pilot’s  NVGs  fail, continuing the airdrop will be at the aircraft commander’s discretion.  As a guide, if the DZ  is  in  sight  and  CARP  alignment  has  been  confirmed  between  the  PF  and  PM,  the airdrop may be continued. A8.3.3.4.  Takeoff,  Approach  and  Landing.    During  an  NVG  takeoff,  if  the  PF experiences  NVG  failure,  takeoff  may  be  continued  at  the  discretion  of  the  aircraft commander; otherwise an abort will be initiated.  If NVG malfunctions occur after Vgo, takeoff will be continued with the other pilot assuming control of the aircraft if necessary.  If either pilot’s NVGs fail after takeoff, continue the climbout and transfer aircraft control to the pilot with operable NVGs.  Strong consideration should be given to continuing the flight  on  autopilot.    During  an  approach,  if  either  pilot  experiences  NVG  failure  below 500’  AGL,  perform  a  go-around.    If  the  PF’s  NVGs  fail  during  or  after  touchdown, transfer control to the PM for the landing rollout. A8.3.4.  Air  Drop.    Unless  used  in  conjunction  with  drop  execution,  avoid  use  of  the  word GREEN after the Combat Entry Checklist and until completion of the Combat Exit Checklist.  “GREEN LIGHT” will be seen or heard by the loadmaster for all drops. A8.3.4.1.  NVG airdrop operations can include drops into unmarked drop zones.  Mission requirements will dictate the release method used. A8.3.4.2.  Jumpmaster  directed  and  pilot  directed  airdrop  without  logic  may  be accomplished  provided  the  drop  zone  is  visually  acquired  and  the  jumpmaster  or  both pilots determine that the load will land within the confines of the drop zone. A8.3.5.  Low-level Navigation A8.3.5.1.  Ground  Proximity  Warning  System  (GPWS)  /  Terrain  Alert  Warning  System (TAWS). A8.3.5.1.1.  For operations in day VMC conditions, with terrain and obstacles clearly in sight, the PF will call runway and/or terrain in sight, state intentions and visually clear terrain. A8.3.5.1.2.  For  operations  at  night  or  in  IMC,  if  an  aural  warning  is  heard, immediately and  simultaneously rotate the aircraft to  establish a climb  while rolling wings  level,  and  add  power  until  the  warning  has  ceased  and  adequate  terrain clearance  is  verified.    WARNING:    Do  not  delay  pull-up  for  diagnosis  of  the  low altitude warning. Failure to roll wings level during the maneuver described above will decrease stall margin at heavy aircraft gross weights. A8.3.5.1.3.  Ensure  the  mode  of  the  GPWS/TAWS  is  commensurate  with  the aircraft’s phase of flight. A8.3.6.  Flight Test Mission. A8.3.6.1.  TPS Curriculum. TPS qual eval flights will be conducted under the guidelines in the Qual Eval Review Board (QRB) documentation.  Normal mission elements may be conducted under the supervision of an IP.  All other mission elements and FTTs will be conducted under the supervision of an IP who is a TPS graduate. A8.4.  Instrument Procedures. 138 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A8.4.1.  The C-17 is approach category D. A8.4.2.  Simulated  Instrument  Flight.  Artificial  vision  restricting  devices  are  not  authorized for any phase of flight. Simulated instrument flight may be flown and logged without the use of a vision-restricting device. A8.4.3.  Approaches.    Crews  are  cleared  at  any  time  to  fly  approaches  to  published minimums (or unit specified minimums, whichever is higher)  using raw data, flight director, or autopilot/auto-throttles.  Exception:  Mission Computer (MC) approaches are cleared for day/night VMC.  For MC approaches in IMC refer to AFI 11-2C-17 Vol 3 for guidance. A8.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A8.5.1.  Minimum Equipment List. A8.5.1.1.  Due to the unique requirements of the test mission, the aircraft commander, in concert with inputs from maintenance, engineering, instrumentation, etc., will be the final authority on mission status. A8.5.1.2.  It  would  be  impractical  to  prepare  a  list  that  would  anticipate  all  possible combinations of equipment malfunction and contingent circumstances.  This section lists the  equipment  and  systems  considered  essential  for  routine  as  well  as  test  operations.  The list does not necessarily include all equipment or systems essential to airworthiness (e.g. rudder, ailerons, elevators, flaps, tires, etc.).  For this MEL, a local area departure is defined as a planned full stop landing outside the local Edwards AFB flying area. A8.5.1.3.  The  aircraft  commander  is  responsible  for  exercising  the  necessary  judgment to  ensure  no  aircraft  is  dispatched  with  multiple items  inoperative  that  may  result  in  an unsafe  degradation  and/or  an  undue  increase  in  crew  workload.    The  possibility  of additional  failures  during  continued  operation  with  inoperative  systems  or  components shall also be considered.  This section is not intended to allow for continued operation of the aircraft for an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative. A8.5.1.4.  Engine  performance,  aircraft  attitude,  vertical  velocity  indications,  altitude, speed, and heading instruments should be operative in both pilot positions. A8.5.1.5.  Aerial Delivery Systems.  The PDM, TRM, Rail Bridge Assembly and Ramp Edge Cover will be operational for equipment airdrop missions.  The retrieval winch(es), GRMs and BSA will be operational for CDS airdrop missions.

Operating Procedures and Restrictions. 148 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A9.5.1.  Checklists.  C-37A/B checklists are designed as clean-up checklists, and items may be  accomplished prior to the checklist being read.  A checklist is not complete until all items have  been  accomplished.  Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions, and  deviations specified in the FCM, etc., are authorized. A9.5.1.1.  The  “Pilot/Flight  Engineer  Checklist  for  the  USAF  C-37A  Aircraft”  assigns checklist  items  to  the  pilot,  copilot,  and  flight  engineer.    If  flying  without  a  flight engineer (or a qualified pilot acting as a flight engineer), the copilot is responsible for all items assigned to the flight engineer. A9.5.2.  Advisory  Calls.    The  PF  will  announce  changes  to  the  level  of  automation,  flight director  and  autopilot  mode  selections  and  mode  transitions,  and/or  when  circumstances require deviating  from normal procedures.  The PM will make all advisory calls except those designated  for  other    crewmembers.    Note:  Automated  aircraft  advisory  calls  satisfy  this requirement.    Table  A9.2  through  Table  A9.6  depict  suggested  calls  for  nonprecision approaches, precision approaches, climb out  and descent, and supplement AOM guidance on mandatory calls. Table A9.2.

Notes for Tables A9.2 through  A9.6. Table A9.2 – A9.6. Notes 1.  The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land or go-around.  If the  runway  environment is not in sight and/or the aircraft is not in position for  a normal landing,  execute a go around. 2.  With weather at CAT I minimums on a CAT I ILS, the pilot may not see the runway environment at DH; however, the initial portion of the approach  lights should be  visible.  The pilot may continue to 100 HAT with reference  to the approach lights.  For a CAT I/II ILS, the pilot may not descend below  100 feet above touchdown zone  elevation using the approach lights as the  sole reference unless the red terminating  bars or the red side row bars are  distinctly 150 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 visible and identifiable. 3.  The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue, or go-  around.  Respond intention to ―Land‖ if runway environment is in sight,  will remain in sight  throughout touchdown and the aircraft is in a position  for a safe landing.  The ―Land‖   call will not be made solely off of the  approach lights unless the requirements in Note  2 are satisfied. 4.  Calls are based off of the radio altimeter. 5.  Tolerances to call “Land” are IAW AOM guidance or as follows if not  specified: a) Airspeed is plus or minus 5 knots of the computed final approach. b) Localizer or glideslope deviations do not exceed ½ dot deviation on the course  deviation indicator (CDI) or glideslope indicator. c) Aircraft track will remain within the lateral confines of the runway extended. d) If any of these are exceeded, or if the aircraft is not stabilized IAW the FCM,  call a Go Around. A9.5.3.  Deviations. A9.5.3.1.  The  PF  will  brief  any  planned  deviations  from  procedures.    The  PM  will announce  any  deviations  from  planned  or  prescribed  procedures  for  the  approach  or departure being flown.  They will also announce course and heading deviations, airspeed  deviations of 5 knots or more below desired, and altitude deviations of 100 feet or more from desired. A9.5.3.2.  Any  crewmember will announce an altitude variation of 200 feet  or more, an airspeed deviation of 10 knots or more below desired, or any potential terrain, obstruction  or traffic clearance problem. A9.5.4.  Communications. A9.5.4.1.  Sterile Cockpit.  Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, flight below 10,000 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL) (except cruise). A9.5.4.2.  Aircraft  Interphone/Datalink.    Do  not  discuss  classified  information  over interphone  or  clear  VHF/HF  datalink  [Aircraft  Communications  Addressing  and Reporting  System  (ACARS)/Airborne  Flight  Information  System  (AFIS)]  channels.  Primary crewmembers will monitor interphone.  Crewmembers will advise the PIC prior to checking off interphone. A9.5.4.3.  The  PM  normally  makes  all  ATC  radio  calls.    Normally,  use  only  one command  radio,  plus  guard.    Monitoring  two  controlling  agencies'  transmissions simultaneously is not recommended.  Exception:  ILS/PRM approaches. A9.5.4.4.  In  terminal  areas  the  primary  crewmembers  at  assigned  stations  will  monitor the primary command radio unless directed otherwise. A9.5.4.5.  Both  pilots  will  monitor  UHF  and  VHF  guard  frequencies  to  the  maximum extent possible. A9.5.4.6.  When  the  aircraft  is  in  an    other  than  normal  configuration  (for  example,  an engine inoperative, hydraulic or electrical malfunction, communications difficulty, etc.), the  pilot  should  request  simultaneous  transmission  of  the  controller's  instructions  on  a single frequency approach if in a terminal area under radar control. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 151 A9.5.5.  Takeoff  or  Landing  Over  Raised  Arresting  Cables  (does  not  include  recessed cables). A9.5.5.1.  When conditions permit [aircraft gross weight, runway length, weather, winds, Takeoff  and  Landing  Data  (TOLD),  etc.]  and  the  PIC  has  considered  the  potential  for damaging the aircraft, make takeoffs and landings beyond raised cable barriers.  Use the entire  length  of  runway  if  necessary.    Be  aware  that  operations  over  arresting  gear barriers  at speeds in excess of taxi speed may result in damage to the aircraft. A9.5.5.2.  Do  not  land  on  a  raised  arresting  cable.    Damage  may  occur  to  the  cable  or aircraft. A9.5.5.3.  If the aircraft  lands before a raised arresting cable and rolls  over it, the flight crew should contact  the tower to  have the cable inspected (this  does not  include rolling over a cable at normal taxi speeds). A9.5.5.4.  Do not  takeoff or land over  a raised arresting cable that has been reported  as slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, Automated Terminal Information Service  (ATIS), ATC, etc. A9.5.6.  Wind Restrictions.  Airfields are considered unusable for takeoff and landing  when winds (including gusts) are greater than established in Table A9.8. Table A9.8.  Wind Restrictions. Maximum Wind  Any Direction Maximum  Tailwind Component Maximum Crosswind Component 50 knots 10 knots AOM limit A9.5.6.1.  The maximum crosswind component during manual (autopilot off) CAT II and CAT III ILS approaches is 10 knots. A9.5.6.2.  The maximum crosswind component for autopilot on CAT II approaches is 20 knots. A9.5.7.  Runway Condition Reading (RCR) or Runway Surface Condition (RSC). A9.5.7.1.  Determine  RCR  versus  maximum  allowable  crosswind  component  from  the FCM.    Braking  Action/Mu  values  from  the  FCM  define  runway  condition  and  aircraft  capability.  RCR equivalents to Braking Action/Mu values are found in the FCM. A9.5.7.2.  Operations  on  runways  partially  covered  with  snow  or  ice,  takeoff  data  is based  on  the  reported  RSC  or  RCR  for  the  cleared  portion  of  the  runway.    To  ensure proper  takeoff  performance  in  the  event  of  an  engine  failure,  the  runway  should  be cleared to allow for your maximum VMCG  offset.  If your required VMCG  offset either side of centerline is not cleared to the reported RSC, then the RSC of the unclear portion, up to your required offset, is  used for takeoff data computations. A9.5.7.3.  RCR  Reporting.    RCR  information  is  obtained    only  within  20    feet  of  the runway  centerline.    Only  the  average  RCR  is  reported.    Many  portions  of  the  runway (laterally  and  longitudinally)  may  have  a  significantly  lower  RCR  than  the  value reported. 152 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A9.5.7.4.  Wet  vs.  RCR.For  operations  on  wet,  un-grooved  runways,    use  the  RCR designated as "wet" in the FCM for all takeoff and landing data.  Use RCR 12 if the "wet" RCR  is  not  designated  in  the  FCM.    For  wet  operations  on  grooved  runways,  use  the RCR corresponding to Dry in the FCM. A9.5.7.5.  No  Reported  RCR  or  RSC.    When  RCR  or  RSC  reporting  is  not  available, flight crews are to consider a runway surface as wet when there is sufficient water on the surface to cause reflective glare or when rain is falling. A9.5.7.6.  Localized Hazards.  RCR or RSC reports do not call attention to localized RSC hazards, i.e. standing water pools, snow, and sand drifts.  Such hazards probably will not be reported unless accompanied by reduced RCR.  Pilots should be alert to the possibility of this condition existing and, if deemed safe, attempt to avoid these hazards. A9.5.7.7.  RCR  Corrections.    Do  not  use  runways  with  reported  RCR  lower  than  the lowest RCR correction contained in the FCM. A9.5.7.8.  If the runway is wet and the reported RCR is higher than the FCM wet RCR, the actual reported RCR may be used for mission accomplishment. A9.5.7.9.  C-37B  operations  on  wet  or  contaminated  runways  require  a  correction  to effective runway length to ensure a screen height of 35 feet is met on takeoff with engine  failure.    The  PIC  will  ensure  applicable  performance  data  is  referenced  when  operating  on wet or contaminated runways. A9.5.8.  Traffic  Alert  and  Collision  Avoidance  System  (TCAS).    The  PIC  will  file  an  AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report  (HATR) if  required to  deviate due to  a resolution advisory (RA). A9.5.8.1.  Aircrew  must  comply  with  all  RA’s.    This  ensures  aircraft  separation computed  by  TCAS.    Advise  ATC  as  soon  as  practical  when  a  deviation  becomes necessary due to a TCAS resolution advisory. A9.5.8.2.  Aircrew  should  visually  clear  the  airspace  and  obtain  clearance  prior  to maneuvering the aircraft in response to a TCAS traffic advisory (TA). A9.5.9.  Touch-and-Go Landings. A9.5.9.1.  Touch-and-go-landings  may  be  performed  by  pilots  qualified  in  the  basic aircraft from either seat. A9.5.9.2.  Do not place the throttles in reverse during a touch-and-go landing.  Rejected takeoffs will not be practiced. A9.5.9.3.  Stop-and-go-landings are not authorized. A9.5.9.4.  The minimum runway for touch and go landings is 5000’ for full flap or 7000’ for partial flap configurations. A9.5.9.4.1.  Ensure  aircraft  performance  assures  full  stop    capability  corrected  for [configuration,  pressure  altitude  (density  altitude  if  appropriate),  temperature, RCR/RSC and crosswinds] per AOM. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 153 A9.5.10.  Basic  Training  Maneuver  Restrictions.    Table  A9.9  lists  the  training  maneuver restrictions and associated minimum altitudes.  These restrictions apply unless deviations are contained in an approved test plan. Table A9.9.  Training Maneuver Restrictions.

(See Note) Limited to day, VMC conditions. Limited to day, VMC conditions. Note:  Simulated Landings.  Use this procedure only when conducting simulated landing training and not to practice missed approaches; it allows simulated training in restricted aircraft   when the objective is to practice setting up the correct landing picture.  Begin the go-around no  later than approximately 2,000 feet remaining.  No simulated emergencies allowed.  Use the  normal landing configuration:  Gear down, flaps 39 for the C-37.  All other training restrictions apply. A9.5.11.  CAT II/III ILS Training. A9.5.11.1.  CAT  II/III  training  and  evaluations  may  be  conducted  at  any  ILS  facility where signal output is accurate and stable enough to achieved the desired training. A9.5.11.1.1.  Weather.    No  lower  than  200-foot  ceiling  and  ½  mile  visibility  (RVR 24) or Category I minimums, whichever is greater. 154 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A9.5.11.1.2.  Winds.    Maximum  crosswind  component  is  IAW  with    A9.5.6  of  this regulation. A9.5.11.1.3.  When a CAT II DH is not published, DH is based on HAT of 100 feet. A9.5.12.  Simulated Emergency Procedures. A9.5.12.1.  Unless  part of an  approved test plan,  simulated emergency procedures other than engine-out approaches and landings are limited to  non-critical  phases of flight  and kept to a minimum at night or in IMC.  Use a realistic training/evaluation approach and do  not  compound  emergencies.    Table  A9.9  provides  restrictions  for  simulated emergency procedures in addition to those presented in this section. A9.5.12.1.1.  Unless  specifically  authorized  elsewhere  in  this  instruction,  do  not practice  emergency  procedures  that  degrade  aircraft  performance  or  flight  control capabilities (in-flight). A9.5.12.2.  Simulated  engine  failures.    Simulated  engine  failures  are  not  authorized  at less than the engine-out minimum control speeds or when any actual emergency exists. A9.5.12.2.1.  Do not perform simulated engine-out approaches at night or in IMC. A9.5.12.3.  Do not perform no-flap approaches at night or in IMC. A9.6.  Prohibited In-Flight Maneuvers. A9.6.1.  The  following  maneuvers  are  accomplished  in    the  simulator  and  not  practiced  or demonstrated in-flight unless part of an approved test plan: A9.6.1.1.  Simulated engine-out takeoffs. A9.6.1.2.  Aborted takeoffs. A9.6.1.3.  Full stalls. A9.6.1.4.  Unusual attitudes. A9.6.1.5.  Dutch roll demonstrations. A9.6.1.6.  Simulated emergency descents. A9.6.1.7.  No-flap landings. A9.6.1.8.  Simulated jammed stabilizer approach and landings. A9.6.1.9.  Landing with inoperative hydraulic system. A9.6.1.10.  Simulated two engine out flight. A9.6.1.11.  Tactics maneuvers.  AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 155 Attachment 10 C-130 OPERATING PROCEDURES A10.1.  General  Information  .    This  attachment,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing directives,  outlines  procedures  for  operation  of  the  C-130  aircraft  under  most  circumstances.  AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all C-130 aircraft must comply with the outlined requirements and consult AFMC/A3V for waivers to this attachment.  Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment. A10.1.1.  Crew Complement and Management. A10.1.1.1.  Non-Currency  and  Qualification  Training.  Non-current  or  unqualified crewmembers  may  perform  in  their  primary  crew  position  when  supervised  by  an instructor  of  like  specialty.  For  pilots,  the  instructor  must  occupy  the  other  pilot  seat. Crewmembers may instruct across like specialty lines for the purposes of scanner duties. (i.e. an instructor pilot qualified as a scanner may instruct a flight engineer during scanner upgrade  and  log  instructor  flight  time  on  the  AFTO  Form  781).    MC-130J  pilots  may instruct  MC-130J  CSO’s  for  the  purpose  of  regaining  currency  in  Phase  I  or  Phase  II events. A10.1.1.2.  Crew Complement. Crew complement for the C-130 is IAW Table A10.1. A10.1.1.2.1.  The minimum crew in AFMC is: A10.1.1.2.1.1.  C-130H and derivative aircraft: pilot; copilot; and flight engineer, or as directed in the applicable aircraft T.O. A10.1.1.2.1.2.  C-130J and derivative aircraft: pilot, copilot, and loadmaster.

When required for mission accomplishment.  Required for low-level navigation unless waived by OG/CC.  For over-water missions, see FLIP AP. 2.  An additional qualified aircrew member may perform scanner duties as  authorized and required by the mission.  FCF scanners must complete specific FCF scanner training. 3.  Two loadmasters or one loadmaster and another qualified crewmember are  required if more than 40 passengers are scheduled to be carried. Both crewmembers  must remain in the cargo compartment, one forward and one aft for takeoffs and  landings. Qualified crewmembers may perform these duties on missions where 15  passengers or less are carried, and floor loaded cargo weight does not exceed 500  pounds. 4.  Only one loadmaster is required for airdrop missions if: A/R A/R A/R 1 3    1  5  1 1 5 1   1 1 a) Using only one paratroop door for personnel or door bundle (less than 100 lbs.) drops. b) High altitude (up to 13,000 MSL) non-static line personnel are dropped from the ramp and door, or only one paratroop door is opened c) Dropping a single CDS using manual gate cut procedures d) Dropping HE training loads using EPJS (C-130J Only) e) Dropping only simulated airdrop training bundles (SATB) f) A no-drop (dry pass only) is planned g) Conducting single hose HAR/TAR h)   At Sq/CC discretion, an instructor loadmaster and student fulfills the two loadmaster requirement to drop unilateral training heavy equipment loads without the Emergency Parachute Jettison System (EPJS) (C-130J and C-130J variants only). This note is not applicable to SMA’s whose primary aircraft does not perform an airdrop mission. 5.  An appropriately trained Loadmaster or Scanner may be substituted. 6.  Comply with the following requirements during mission sorties: a) One AG:  Only one AG is required during mission training sorties that will not conduct Common Launch Tube (CLT) installation/removal procedures or live fire AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 157 any Gun Weapon Systems (GWS). One AG is authorized to configure GWS for motion, but will not place rounds in the GWS. b) Two AGs:  Required to conduct CLT installation/removal procedures or to perform live fire operations when only one GWS will be utilized. c) Three AGs:  Required to perform live fire operations when utilizing multiple GWS. 7.  An additional aircrew member may be added to facilitate the FCF mission and document check results. A10.1.1.3.  Pilot  Qualification  Training.  Pilot  mission  qualification  training  may  be conducted  on  missions  with  passengers  onboard  only  if  the  individual  in  training  is qualified  (completed  aircraft  checkride  with  a  valid  AF  Form  8)  for  the  seat  position occupied. A10.1.1.3.1.  Maintenance personnel  and civilian  employees under direct  contract  to the DoD, engaged in official direct mission support activities, are considered mission essential  and  may  be  onboard  when  touch-and-go  or  stop-and-go  landings  are performed. A10.2.  Mission Planning. A10.2.1.  Minimum  Altitudes.  See  Section  A10.  3.7.  Minimum  Altitudes,  for  guidance  to compute all low-level related altitudes. A10.2.2.  Departure  Planning.  Use  AFI  11-202V3,  AFMAN  11-217V1,  and  this  instruction when planning an IFR departure. A10.2.2.1.  IFR Departures. A10.2.2.1.1.  AFMC/A3  authorizes  reduced  obstacle  climb  gradient  takeoffs  up  to  a gross weight (GW) which would, in the event of an engine failure, not lower the rate of climb to less than a 2.5 percent climb gradient (152 ft./NM). A10.2.2.1.2.  Critical  Field  Length  (CFL).  Takeoff  GW  must  never    exceed    that which would require CFL in excess of the runway available for a normal takeoff. If a DER  crossing  requirement  exceeds  50  feet,  use  the  correction  chart  in  the performance manual for balanced critical field length for the first 50 feet, and add 50 feet to balanced critical field length for every foot of altitude above 50 feet. Example: 55 feet DER crossing requires the full correction on the balanced critical field length chart  plus  250  additional  feet  of  balanced  critical  field  length.  Required  screen heights  depend  on  the  agency  that  wrote  the  standard  instrument  departure  (SID).  Note:   N/A for Maximum  Effort  operations.  Comply with  MFLMETO  guidance in the applicable Dash-1 / Dash-1-1. A10.2.2.1.3.  If  unable  to  determine  the  DER  altitude  required,  use  35  feet  for planning purposes. A10.2.2.1.4.  If  the  requirements  of  AFI  11-202V3  have  been  complied  with  (Note: fuel dumping does not meet the requirements of immediate jettison to reduce weight) then  use  the  following  guidance  for  departure  planning.  If  no  minimum  climb gradient is published, use 200 ft/NM with all engines operating and 152 ft./NM (per paragraph  A10.2.2.1.1)  with  one  engine  inoperative.  If  a  higher  climb  gradient  is 158 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 published or required for radar vectors, use that climb gradient as the minimum with all  engines  operating  and  AFMC/A3  authorizes  use  of  the  required  climb  gradient minus 48 ft/NM as the minimum with one engine inoperative. If the departure airfield does  not  have  an  instrument  approach,  then  an  obstacle  survey  has  not  been completed.  Therefore  an  IFR  departure  is  not  authorized.    If  the  published  IFR departure  procedure  does  not  include  either  routing  or  a  minimum  climb  gradient (weather mins. only) then an IFR departure using those procedures is not authorized. A10.2.2.1.5.  If  the  airport  does  not  have  an  authorized  IFR  departure  method,  the weather  at  takeoff  must  permit  a  VFR  climb  to  an  IFR  MEA,  an  appropriate  IFR cruising  altitude,  or  an  altitude  where  an  IFR  clearance  can  be  obtained  (i.e.  ATC vectors). A10.2.2.2.  VFR Departures. VFR Departures will not be flown in lieu of proper obstacle clearance planning. A10.2.2.2.1.  VFR  departures  require  detailed  planning  to  ensure  obstacles  and  high terrain  is  avoided.  Conduct  VFR  operations  only  when  required  for  mission accomplishment. A10.2.2.2.2.  The  minimum  climb  gradient  on  four  engines  must  ensure  obstacles clearance  along  the  planned  departure  route.  Note:  Use  the  climb-out  flight  path  -4 engines charts for this calculation. A10.2.2.2.3.  Engine-out  climb  gradient  capability  ensures  that  in  the  event  of  an engine  failure,  the  planned  departure  or  emergency  return  route  provides  obstacle avoidance.    VFR  departures  must  ensure  they  can  vertically  clear  published  IFR departure  procedure  restrictions  along  the  planned  departure  route  with  one  engine inoperative.    When  departing  VFR  and  unable  to  vertically  clear  published  IFR departure  procedure  restrictions  along  the  planned  departure  route  with  one  engine inoperative,  AFMC/A3  (as  delegated)  authorizes  operations  at  or  below  an  aircraft gross weight that enables a climb rate of at least 300 feet per minute on three engines at obstacle clearance speed.  Use the takeoff gross weight limited by 3 engine climb performance charts for this calculation.  The pilot shall ensure pre-departure planning includes  emergency  return  routing  (if  applicable)  and  a  gross  weight  reduction  plan (fuel dumping and/or cargo jettison) if applicable. A10.2.3.  Flight Data Calculations. A10.2.3.1.  Computer Flight Plans.  The authorized flight planning software for most C-130 variants is PFPS/CFPS/JMPS.  If your aircraft is not supported by PFPS/CFPS, use a contractor-developed equivalent or compute the flight plan manually. A10.2.3.2.  Navigators/CSOs will refer to applicable 11-2MDS Volumes for guidance for fuel planning when required for the mission. A10.2.3.3.  (C-130H  and  variants)  A  pilot  crewmember,  or  additional  flight  engineer, will  crosscheck  the  TOLD  Card  for  accuracy  by  using  the  performance  manual  or approved tab data.  As a minimum, the person checking the data will: A10.2.3.3.1.  Verify gross weight independently from the TOLD Card. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 159 A10.2.3.3.2.  Review  and  compare  the  computed  distances  or  ground  roll  with  the actual conditions, runway available, and departure procedures. A10.2.3.3.3.  Crosscheck minimum control, takeoff, and landing speeds. A10.2.3.4.  (C-130J  and  variants)  Pilots  will  crosscheck information for accuracy. the  CNI-MU  TOLD A10.2.3.4.1.  Verify gross weight independently from the entered value. A10.2.3.4.2.  Verify the entered parameters and configurations. A10.2.3.4.3.  Verify the correct speeds have been entered into the V SPEEDS page. A10.2.3.4.4.  Review  and  compare  the  computed  distances  or  ground  roll  with  the actual conditions and  runway available. A10.2.4.  Runway  and  Taxiway  Minimums.      Minimum  dimensions  for  aircraft  operations are shown in Table A10.2. Table A10.2.  Minimum Dimensions. Parameter: Taxiway width Minimum Requirement: 30 ft. Runway width Runway length (Normal T/O)  Runway length (Normal ldg) Runway length (Assault ldg) Runway length (Assault T/O) 80 ft. for normal ops  (non-assault qualified crews) 60 ft. for assault ops  (assault qualified crews)  Note:  Both pilots must be assault qualified, or a non-qualified pilot must be under the direct supervision of an assault qualified IP. Critical Field  Length (Balanced or Unbalanced for C-130H), or IAW Table 2.1, whichever is  longer. Landing distance from 50 ft. over the  threshold, plus 500 ft.*  *For RVR(Vis) less than 4000m (3/4 mile): Add 1,000 ft. to landing distance Ground roll plus 500 ft., but not less than  3000 ft. Compute landing performance with two engines in reverse, two engines in ground  idle, and full brakes Charted Minimum Field Length for  Maximum Effort Takeoff (MFLMETO)  (corrected for one-engine Vcma, if  applicable), but not less than 3,000 ft.  Takeoff at Vmca in ground effect or  Vmeto, whichever is greater, unless actual  obstacles are a factor.  Vmca corrections may be disregarded  while conducting approved test plan  operations or while conducting approved assault takeoff/landing upgrade training 160 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 NVG Takeoff Same as Normal or Assault  T/O NVG Landing (Normal) Same as Normal Landing NVG Landing (Assault) Ground Roll plus 500 feet for marked touchdown (500 ft.) zones.  Use Ground  Roll plus 1,000 feet for unmarked zones or 1,000 ft. marked zones. A10.2.5.  Operations over Runway cables. A10.2.5.1.  Do  not  land  on  (touchdown  on)  approach  end  arresting  cables  (does  not include recessed cables).  If the aircraft lands before the cable, contact the tower to have the cable inspected. A10.2.5.2.  Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as slack,  loose,  or  improperly  rigged  by  NOTAM,  automated  terminal  information  service (ATIS) or ATC. A10.2.5.3.  Operations  are  authorized  on  runways  where  BAK-12  systems  are  installed, with  a  minimum  of  a  six-point  cable  tie-down  system,  without  regard  to  the  Dash-One Restriction.  The aircraft must cross the cable within the lateral dimension of the tie down system  to  avoid  damage.    When  operating  from  runways  equipped  with  other  types  of systems, or if it is unknown if the BAK-12 system includes six point tie-downs, aircrews should recognize the increased risk of damage to the aircraft. A10.2.6.  LZ  Markings.    Refer  to  AFI  13-217.    The  markings  must  be  firmly  established during mission planning and included in the aircrew briefing. A10.2.7.  Minimum Runway Condition Report (RCR).  Refer to paragraph 2.15 and  3.2.5.  When  no  RCR  is  available,  refer  to  the  C-130  Dash-1-1  for  standard  ICAO  conversions based on general runway condition. A10.2.8.  Crash Fire Rescue (CFR).  Up to  four takeoffs  and landings within  7 consecutive days may be accomplished at airfields without appropriate CFR readily available.   Units will track landings to ensure a subsequent crew does not exceed this limit. A10.2.9.  Reduced Power Operations.  (C-130H and variants) Reduced power operations are intended to prolong engine service life. A10.2.9.1.  During  proficiency  flights,  TIT  will  not  be  less  than  900  degrees  C  for takeoff, not to exceed 19,600 in-lbs. of torque. A10.2.9.2.  Reduce power for formation takeoffs to a torque corresponding to a TIT of no less  than  970  degrees  C  for  takeoff  and  climb.    Higher  power  settings  may  be  used,  if needed, and will be briefed by the formation commander. A10.2.9.3.  Climb power to cruise altitude will be 970 degrees C TIT for -15 engines and 932 degrees C TIT for -7 engines, unless mission requirements dictate otherwise, not to exceed 19,600 in-lbs. of torque. A10.2.9.4.  Use  maximum  power  for  max  effort  takeoffs  (actual  or  simulated),  not  to exceed 19,600 in-lbs. of torque. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 161 A10.2.10.  Turbulence.    AFH  11-203V2,  Weather  for  Aircrews  –  Products  and  Services, defines the C-130 as  a category  III  aircraft  for turbulence. Additionally,  AFMC applies the following guidance/restrictions: A10.2.10.1.  For Low Level Operations utilize turbulence category II criteria. A10.2.10.2.  Comply  with  AFI  11-202V3  guidance  for  any  forecast  or  observed  Severe Turbulence.    Do  not  use  the  AFH  11-203V2  Aircraft  Turbulence  Intensity  Conversion Chart to downgrade severe turbulence for any flight regime. A10.2.10.3.  AF  produced  turbulence  products  are  based  upon  category  II  aircraft.    If referencing  other  products  or  reports,  crews  should  confirm  the  type  of  aircraft  the forecast  turbulence  applies  to,  or  what  type  of  aircraft  reported  the  encounter,  to  gain  a more accurate picture for their route of flight. A10.3.  Common  Mission  Guidance.  Aircrew  attached  to  AFSOC  or  AFSOC  gained  flying organizations  will  comply  with  AFSOC  published  guidance  when  flying  sorties  on  an  AFSOC Flight Authorization. A10.3.1.  Air  Refueling.    The  C-130  can  fulfill  roles  as  a  tanker  during  Helicopter  Air Refueling  (HAR)  or  Tiltrotor  Air  Refueling  (TAR).    Special  Mission  C-130  variants  may also  be  capable  or  Air-to-Air  Refueling  (AAR)  as  a  receiver.    Contact  AFMC/A3V  for guidance  when/if these  mission elements  are  required.   N/A  for  AFMC  aircrew attached to AFSOC or AFSOC gained flying organizations. A10.3.2.  Formation.    All  tactical  and  special  formation  procedures  will  be  flown  in accordance with AFI 11-2C-130V3 or AFI 11-2C-130JV3. A10.3.2.1.  The  most  probable  formation  flown  in  AFMC  is  visual  fluid  trail.    Spacing will be as briefed/required but will be flown to assure nose/tail and wing tip separation. A10.3.3.  NVG  Operations.    NVGs  are  approved  for  use  during  takeoffs  and  landings  for properly qualified aircrew. A10.3.3.1.  NVG  Altitudes.    Aircrew  may  use  NVGs  to  maintain  situational  awareness and  to  visually  clear  at  any  altitude.    NVG  Low-level  operations  flown  by  qualified aircrew may be conducted at 300 ft. contours for level/rolling terrain and in mountainous terrain. A10.3.4.  Airdrop  Procedures.    AFMC  aircrew  will  reference  AFI  11-2C-130V3/11-2C-130JV3  and/or  AFI  11-2MC-130V3/AFI  11-2MC-130JV3  for  additional  guidance  for  the various  airdrop  operations  capable  on  the  C-130.    AFMC  aircrew  attached  to  AFSOC  or AFSOC  gained  flying  organizations  will  comply  with  AFI  11-2MC-130V3/AFI  11-2MC-130JV3. A10.3.4.1.  Specialized  airdrop  equipment  (test  articles,  etc)  will  be  operated  in accordance with test plans and/or locally approved procedures. A10.3.5.  Low-level  Navigation.    The  low-level  environment  is  defined  in  Chapter  3.      C-130  low-level  operations  are  not  held  to  LASDT  constraints.    Instead,  if  the  crew  member has  received  an  AF  Form  8  documented  low-level  evaluation  from  a  formal  school qualification  program,  that  individual  is  low-level  qualified  to  the  altitudes  outlined  in  this attachment.  For all others, gain low-level qualification by completing the AFMC published 162 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 low-level training plan.  Except for navigation profiles flown as part of approved test plans or in conjunction with FCF profiles, do not operate the aircraft lower than the altitudes shown below. A10.3.6.  Minimum Altitudes. A10.3.6.1.  Day  VMC  Enroute.    Plan  a  minimum  of  300  feet  AGL  modified  contour altitude above the terrain using visual references and radar altimeter.  Aircrews may fly lower  to  perform  system  checks  (OCF/FCF/  Test  etc.).    However  limit  time  below  300 feet to the minimum required for system checks. A10.3.6.2.  Night  VMC  Enroute.  (Non-NVG) Plan enroute legs at  an indicated altitude of 500 feet above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot  elevation),  or  400  feet  plus  one  chart  contour  interval  above  the  highest  depicted terrain  contour,  whichever  is  highest,  within  3  NMs  of  route  centerline  to  include  the aircraft turn radius over each turn point.  If the altitude for the next leg is higher than the current leg altitude, climb will be completed prior to the turn point.  If the altitude for the next  leg  is  lower  than  the  current  leg,  do  not  initiate  descent  until  over  the  turn  point.  Legs may be divided into segments for night altitude computations, depending on terrain differential or threats in order to allow flight closer to the ground.  Once the obstacle or terrain feature is visually identified and the aircraft is confirmed well clear, the crew may descend to the next segmented altitude, if lower.  Note: Planning a route on a JOG chart, if available, significantly reduces night  enroute altitudes.   If the route has been planned on a JOG and night altitudes are verified, the route may be flown with the lower altitudes when flying with reference to a tactical pilotage chart (TPC). A10.3.6.3.  Night  VMC  (NVG)    Plan  a  minimum  of  300  feet  AGL  modified  contour altitude above the terrain using visual references and radar altimeter.  Minimum visibility is 3 NM. A10.3.6.4.  TF Operations.  TF operations may be flown at any set clearance.  Day/IMC and night VMC TF operations requires additional training.  See AFI 11-2FT Vol 1, C-130 Attachment. A10.3.6.5.  Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA).  MSA is an initial VFR altitude that provides additional terrain clearance while the aircrew analyzes situations that require interruption of low-level operations (route disorientation and equipment malfunctions or when either pilot must leave the seat during low-level operations, etc.  Climb to the 500 set clearance plane if a pilot must leave the seat during TF operations.).  An MSA will be computed for each  leg,  route  segment,  or  entire  low-level  route.    Compute  MSA  the  same  as  night (non-NVG) altitudes above. A10.3.6.6.  Minimum IFR Enroute Altitude.  Compute minimum IFR enroute altitude by adding  1,000  feet  (2,000  feet  in  mountainous  terrain)  above  the  highest  obstruction  to flight  (man-made  obstruction,  terrain  feature,  or  spot  elevation)  within  5  NMs  of  route centerline.  Round this altitude to the next 100-foot increment. A10.3.6.6.1.  Minimum  altitudes  for  IFR  operations  within  published  Military Training  Routes  (MTRs)  in  US  sovereign  airspace  will  be  the  computed  leg  MSAs unless a higher altitude is required by FLIP AP/1B. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 163 A10.3.6.7.  Emergency  Safe  Altitude  (ESA).    ESA  is  designed  to  provide  positive  IMC terrain clearance during emergency situations that require leaving the low-level structure.  Several  ESAs  may  be  computed  for  route  segments  transiting  significant  terrain differentials,  or  a  single  ESA  may  be  computed  for  the  entire  low-level  route.    To compute ESA, add 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) to the elevation of the highest obstruction to flight within 10 NMs either side of the planned route centerline. A10.3.6.7.1.  Climbing  to  the  ESA  may  put  the  aircraft  in  a  controlled  (i.e.,  IFR) altitude structure requiring coordination with air traffic control agencies. A10.3.6.8.  Pressure altimeters are calibrated to indicate true altitudes under international standard  atmospheric  (ISA)  conditions.    Any  deviation  from  these  standard  conditions will  result  in  erroneous  readings  on  the  altimeter.    This  error  becomes  important  when considering  obstacle  clearances  in  temperatures  lower  than  standard  since  the  aircraft's altitude  is  below  the  figure  indicated  by  the  altimeter.    Refer  to  the  flight  information handbook to determine correction. A10.3.7.  Chase  Operations.    C-130  aircrew  are  not  normally  required  to  maintain  chase qualification. A10.3.7.1.  If  the  C-130  is  required  to  fly  as  a  test  mission  chase,  the  following restrictions apply: A10.3.7.1.1.  The C-130 acts as chase for another C-130. A10.3.7.1.1.1.  The aircrew will be C-130 visual formation qualified. A10.3.7.1.1.2.  All formation procedures will be IAW this Instruction.  Formation spacing will be no closer than 200ft. A10.3.7.1.2.  If  the  C-130  aircrew  is  required  to  chase  any  other  aircraft,  Chase qualification training will be completed IAW 2FT Vol 1 and the Procedures in Chap 3 of this Instruction will be complied with. A10.3.7.1.2.1.  Chase spacing will be no closer than 200ft. A10.3.7.2.  If a specific test mission requires an aircraft to chase the C-130, the following restrictions apply: A10.3.7.2.1.  Prior to each chase sortie, supervisory personnel will ensure the C-130 PIC  and  chase  pilots  are  briefed  on  the  mission  content,  restrictions,  and responsibilities. A10.3.7.2.2.  The  C-130  and  chase  aircraft  must  maintain  radio  contact  throughout the chase operation. A10.3.7.2.3.  It  is  unsafe  to  fly  in  close  vertical  proximity  to  another  aircraft  due  to the interrelated aerodynamic effects.  Never fly directly over or under another aircraft.  The chase position is will be defined I the test plan, but will be no closer than 200ft. A10.3.7.2.4.  The  normal  chase  position  will  be  dictated  by requirements. the test  plan 164 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A10.3.7.2.5.  The  C-130  aircraft  must  inform  the  chase  aircraft  and  receive acknowledgment  prior  to  initiating  turns,  climbs  and  descents,  airspeed  changes,  or configuration changes (e.g. flaps, gear, etc.). A10.3.8.  Test  Pilot  School  (TPS)  Curriculum.    Any  curriculum  profile  will  be  flown  IAW the  procedures  and  limitations  of  the  applicable  C-130  and  IAW  all  guidance  in  this Instruction.  An IP will be in the seat for all TPS curriculum events. A10.3.9.  Use  of  Automation  (C-130J).    When  automation  is  used  (AFCS/FD  and  auto throttles)  the  pilot  flying  will  normally  initiate  all  AFCS/FD/autothrottole  inputs  into  the system.  When hand flying the aircraft, the non-flying pilot will normally make the inputs. A10.3.9.1.  The “two button rule” will be used for C-130J system operations.  The flying pilot  should  exchange  aircraft  control  for  any  duty  that  requires  the  flying  pilot  to  be heads down for more than two CNI inputs. A10.4.  Instrument Procedures. A10.4.1.  Instrument Approach Procedures. A10.4.1.1.  The C-130 is normally a category C aircraft.  If approach speeds exceed 140 knots, the minimums for category D will be used. A10.4.1.2.  Circling Approach.  If the circling minimums are not published by category, ensure the HAA and visibility are not less than the following: A10.4.1.2.1.  Category C - 500 feet – 1 ½ miles. A10.4.1.2.2.  Category D - 600 feet - 2 miles. A10.4.1.3.  If  full  flight  instrumentation  is  not  available  and  operational,  base  DH  or MDA on a minimum HAT or HAA of 300 feet and RVR 40, or visibility ¾ mile if RVR is  not  available.    Full  flight  instrumentation  for  all  approaches  includes  barometric altimeters,  airspeed  indicators,  vertical  velocity  indicators,  heading  indicators,  and attitude  indicators,  in  the  pilot  and  copilot  positions.    For  an  ILS/MLS  full  flight instrumentation also includes dual flight displays.  One flight director for the pilot flying the approach, plus ADI repeat (C-130J: same sources for the Primary Flight Display) for the  pilot  monitoring  the  approach  satisfies  this  requirement.    MC-130H  standby instruments do not satisfy this requirement. A10.4.1.4.  For precision radar approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 24 or ½ mile if RVR is not available.  DH will be based on an HAT of no less than 200 feet. A10.4.1.5.  Fly a precision approach, if available, at night  and during marginal weather.  If  PAR,  MLS,  ILS,  or  LPV  is  not  available,  fly  any  available  approved  instrument approach.    On  training  and  evaluation  flights,  or  flights  at  familiar  airfields,  pilots  may fly  nonprecision  approaches  or  VFR  patterns  to  accomplish  required  training  or evaluation requirements. A10.4.2.  Advisory Calls.  C-130 crews will use the guidance below versus that listed in AFI 11-2FTV3 Chap 4.  The pilot flying will periodically announce intentions during departure, arrivals,  approaches,  and  when  circumstances  require  deviating  from  normal  procedures.  Mandatory advisory calls are: (The pilot not flying the aircraft will make these calls except those designated for any crewmember). AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 165 A10.4.2.1.  Takeoff.  State "GO" at refusal speed or takeoff speed, whichever is lower.  If refusal  speed  is  lower  than  takeoff  speed,  state  “Rotate”  at  takeoff  speed.    Any crewmember  noting  a  safety  of  flight  malfunction  before  hearing  “GO”  will  state “REJECT” with a brief description of the malfunction. A10.4.2.2.  Takeoff  Aborts  and  Landings:  The  Flight  Engineer  (non-flying  pilot  for  C- 130J)  will  state  which  throttles  /  power  levers  may  be  brought  into  reverse:  “All  4”, “Inboards”, or “Outboards” as appropriate. A10.4.2.3.  Altitude calls: A10.4.2.3.1.  1000 feet above initial approach fix (IAF) (or holding) altitude. A10.4.2.3.2.  Transition altitude/level. A10.4.2.3.3.  1000 feet above/below assigned altitude. A10.4.2.4.  Approaches: A10.4.2.4.1.  Call 100 feet above procedure turn, final approach fix (FAF), MDA, or DH altitude. A10.4.2.4.2.  Non-precision approaches. A10.4.2.4.2.1.  “Minimums” when reaching MDA. A10.4.2.4.2.2.  “Runway in sight”.  Call when sufficient visual reference with the runway  environment  is  established  and  the  aircraft  is  in  a  safe  position  to  land.  Do  not  call  too  soon  when  obstructions  to  vision,  such  as  fog,  haze,  low  stratus clouds, etc., are present. A10.4.2.4.2.3.  “Go-around”.    Call  at  missed  approach  point  when  visual reference with the runway environment is insufficient to continue the approach, or if the aircraft is not in a position for a safe landing. A10.4.2.4.3.  Precision approaches. A10.4.2.4.3.1.  “Continue”.  Call at DH if only the approach lighting system is in sight and a determination cannot yet be made that the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.  If an approach is continued below DH based on seeing the approach lights only (an approach to visibility minimums), “Go-around” must be called by 100 feet if a determination to land cannot be made. A10.4.2.4.3.2.  “Land”.    Call  at  DH  if  runway  environment  is  in  sight  and  the aircraft is in a position for a normal landing. A10.4.2.4.3.3.  “Go-around”.  Call at DH or later if the runway environment is not in sight or if the aircraft is not in a position for a safe landing.  If an approach is continued  below  DH  based  on  seeing  the  approach  lights  only  (an  approach  to visibility minimums), ―Go-around‖ must be called by 100 feet if a determination to land cannot be made. A10.4.2.5.  Deviations. 166 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A10.4.2.5.1.  The pilot not flying the aircraft will tell the other pilot when heading or airspeed deviations  are observed or  altitude is  more than 100 feet  from desired, and no attempt is being made to correct the deviation. A10.4.2.5.2.  Any crewmember seeing a variation of 200 feet altitude, a deviation of ±10 knots or a potential terrain obstruction problem will immediately notify the pilot.  Deviations  from  prescribed  procedures  for  the  approach  being  flown  will  also  be announced. A10.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A10.5.1.  Flight  Duty  Period  (FDP).    Limit  crew  day  to  12  hours  with  an  inoperative autopilot.  If the autopilot fails after departure, continue to the next scheduled stop and then comply with the 12-hour duty limitation.  Engines Running On-load/Offload (ERO) are not limited  in  the  three-sortie  maximum.    The  maximum  FDP  for  a  basic  aircrew  (not augmented) is 16 hours.  All tactical (mission) events, FCF, or test events will be completed within the first 12 hours of the FDP. A10.5.2.  Duty Station.  Only one pilot, or the flight engineer, may be absent from their duty station at a time.  Notify the aircraft commander prior to departing assigned duty station. A10.5.3.  Flight Deck Access.  Aircraft commanders may authorize passengers access to the flight station during any phase of flight.  Passengers will not be permitted access to any pilot position. A10.5.4.  Personal Equipment Requirements. A10.5.4.1.  Parachutes  and  Survival  Kits.    AFMC  aircraft  will  be  configured  with parachutes  and  ML-4  survival  kits  for  contingency,  crash  damage  recovery  flights, airdrop  tests,  refueling  tests,  hazardous  acceptance/test,  research  flights  to  certify airworthiness,  or  O8E  coded  functional  check  flights.    In  addition  to  these  missions, OG/CCs retain the option of requiring parachutes and survival kits on any other mission.  Survival Vests may be used in lieu of Survival Kits. A10.5.4.2.  Helmets  and  Oxygen  Masks.    Carry  a  personal  helmet  and  oxygen  mask anytime  parachutes  are  required  aboard  the  aircraft  (to  avoid  head  injuries  during bailout). A10.5.5.  Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects. A10.5.5.1.  During  the  flight,  the  number  of  persons  on  the  flight  deck  will  be  the minimum commensurate with mission requirements. A10.5.5.2.  Ensure  helmet  bags  and  other  personal  gear  is  properly  stowed  to  prevent obstruction of egress routes during emergencies. A10.5.6.  Outside Observer.  When available, use a crewmember to assist in outside clearing any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL and during all taxi operations. A10.5.7.  Aircraft Lighting. A10.5.7.1.  Unless  otherwise  directed  the  aircraft  strobe  lights  will  be  operated  as follows: A10.5.7.1.1.  "Before Starting Engines" Checklist, "red" position. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 167 A10.5.7.1.2.  "Lineup"  Checklist,  "white"  for  day,  night  single-ship,  and  day formation.  "Red" for night formation. A10.5.7.1.3.  "After Landing" Checklist, "red" position. A10.5.8.  Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. A10.5.8.1.  Aircraft  Refueling.    Non-essential  crewmembers  and  passengers  are  not allowed on board. A10.5.8.1.1.  Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized. A10.5.8.1.2.  For  aeromedical  evacuation,  refer  to  AFI  11-2C-130V3  or  11-2C-130JV3. A10.5.8.1.3.  Concurrent qualified ground crews may perform simultaneous refueling and cargo loading. A10.5.8.1.4.  SCNS/INS  and/or  mission  computers  may  be  on  and  may  have  data inserted during refuel.  Do not turn on or off during refuel operations. A10.5.8.1.5.  Use primary fuel management IAW the aircraft flight manual whenever practical. A10.5.8.2.  Fire Protection. A10.5.8.2.1.  The  aircraft  engine  fire  extinguisher  system  fulfills  the  minimum requirements for fire protection during engine start. A10.5.8.2.2.  A  fire  guard  is  required  for  all  engine  starts.    In  the  absence  of additional ground personnel, the ground controller or an additional crewmember may act as the fire guard. A10.5.9.  Life Support/Aircrew Flight Equipment Requirements. A10.5.9.1.  Oxygen.    Oxygen  on  board  for  takeoff  must  be  sufficient  to  accomplish  the planned mission from the equal time point (ETP) should oxygen be required (minimum 5 liters or 300 PSI). A10.5.9.1.1.  On  missions  carrying  passengers,  distribute  supplemental  oxygen  to each  passenger  regardless  if  planned  flight  altitude  is  above  FL  250.    If  POKs  are used, the kits need only be positioned on the aircraft and distributed to each passenger for  scheduled  flights  above  FL  250.    Demonstrate  proper  use  prior    to    climbing through FL 250 A10.5.9.1.2.  Crewmembers  occupying  a  crew  station  will  have  an  oxygen  mask (helmet  or  quick-don)  connected  and  readily  available  for  use  on  all  flights,  from before engine start until engine shutdown. A10.5.9.1.3.  Aircrews  required  to  fly  un-pressurized  missions  will  follow  the guidance in AFI 11-409. A10.5.9.1.4.  Life preserver units (LPUs).  The loadmaster/scanner will place an LPU within  easy  reach  of  each  seated  passenger  and  aircrew  member  for  over-water flights.  Crewmembers will fit and adjust LPUs for over-water flights and will wear 168 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 them  on  over-water  missions  below  2,000  ft  AGL.    (LPUs  need  not  be  worn  for takeoffs, landings, or approaches). A10.5.10.  Communications. A10.5.10.1.  Sterile  Cockpit.    Limit  conversation  to  that  essential  for  crew  coordination and mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and any flight below 10,000 feet MSL (except cruise). A10.5.10.2.  Aircraft Interphone.  Primary crewmembers will monitor interphone during critical  phases  of  flight.    All  C-130J  crewmembers  will  monitor  VOX  in  addition  to Interphone /  Primary  net during critical  phases of flight.   Crewmembers  will advise the aircraft commander prior to checking off interphone. A10.5.10.3.  Command Radios: A10.5.10.3.1.  The  pilot  not  flying  the  aircraft  normally  makes  all  air  traffic  control (ATC) radio calls. A10.5.10.3.2.  The  pilot  operating  the  radios  will  announce  which  radio  is  primary, and advise the crew when the primary radio changes. A10.5.10.3.3.  One  pilot  will  record  and  acknowledge  all  ATC  clearances.    Another crewmember should monitor the read back and ensure compliance. A10.5.10.3.4.  Both pilots will monitor UHF guard (or VHF guard when appropriate) regardless of primary radio. A10.5.11.  Reverse Taxi. A10.5.11.1.  The pilot will coordinate reverse taxi directions and signals to be used with the scanner or loadmaster. A10.5.11.2.  Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated. A10.5.11.3.  Open  the  aft  cargo  door  and  lower  the  ramp  to  approximately  12  inches above horizontal. A10.5.11.4.  The scanner or loadmaster will be on the aircraft ramp in the best position to direct  reverse  taxi,  report  any  hazards,  and  to  provide  the  pilot  with  timely  interphone instructions  on  turns,  distance  remaining,  conditions  of  the  maneuvering  area,  and stopping point. A10.5.12.  Engine  Running  On-load  and  Offload  (ERO).    Comply  with  published  ERO checklists (when  available in  applicable  Dash-1  operations)  and the  general  guidance listed below.    Use  ERO  procedures  when  necessary  to  expedite  aircraft  movement  or  permit  the exchange of crewmembers.  ERO procedures may be used for any mix of personnel or cargo.  Material  handling  equipment  should  be  used  if  palletized  cargo  is  to  be  on-loaded  or offloaded.    Aircraft  commanders  must  assess  prevailing  weather,  lighting  and  parking location to ensure safe operations.  WARNING: Do not on-load or offload through the crew entrance door and cargo ramp and door at the same time.  Paratroop doors will not normally be  used.    Note:  At  their  discretion,  aircraft  commanders  may  ERO  any  category  of passenger.  The number of passengers and amount of baggage to be on-loaded or offloaded should be taken into consideration.  Pilots AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 169 A10.5.12.1.  General Procedures. A10.5.12.1.1.  Aircraft  commanders  will  brief  crewmembers  on  the  intended  ERO operation. A10.5.12.1.2.  The  parking  brake  will  be  set  and  at  least  one  pilot  in  the  seat  will monitor brakes, interphone, and radio. A10.5.12.1.3.  The  pilot  will  ensure  the  aircraft  is  depressurized  and  comply  with guidance for emitters (STBY or OFF for items such as radar). A10.5.12.1.4.  Use wing leading edge and taxi lights to enhance safety at night as the situation dictates. A10.5.12.1.5.  Station  another  crewmember  on  interphone  or  public  address  (PA)  in the  cargo  compartment  as  safety  observer.    Safety  observers  will  remain  forward  of all cargo. A10.5.12.1.6.  C-130 J crews should consider using HOTEL mode for the propellers.  If  this  is  utilized,  select  Emergency  Brakes  prior  to  selecting  HOTEL  mode  on engines 1 and 2.  While down-sped, the hydraulic pumps are also turning at 29% and may  not  deliver  enough  pressure  to  maintain  normal  brakes  under  certain circumstances. A10.5.12.1.7.  Do not move the aircraft until a “Clear to Taxi” call is received from the Loadmaster or other appropriate crewmember. A10.5.12.2.  Offload  Preparation/Procedures.    Aerial  delivery  support  (ADS)  arms  will remain connected in flight.  Prior to landing, the loadmaster will brief all personnel in the cargo compartment regarding their locations, duties, and responsibilities during the ERO. A10.5.12.2.1.  One tie-down device forward and aft will remain connected to vehicles until the aircraft is parked. A10.5.12.2.2.  Vehicles and passengers will proceed directly aft of the aircraft at least 50 feet before turning and/or 300 feet before stopping. A10.5.12.3.  Personnel on/offload through the aft cargo door and ramp. A10.5.12.3.1.  Passengers  will  be  escorted  by  a  crewmember  when  enplaning  or deplaning through the aft door and ramp. A10.5.12.3.2.

An  aircraft  commander  or  higher  (IP/EP)  will occupy either the left or right seat during all takeoffs, landings, and critical phases of flight.  The designated PIC (A-Code) is  not  required to  occupy  a primary position, but  still  retains overall  authority  for  the  conduct  of  the  mission.    Pilots  (MP/FP)  or  Instructor  pilots  may takeoff or land from either seat.  Copilots (MC) will only takeoff or land from the right seat unless in upgrade status to MP/FP and under the direct supervision of an IP. A10.5.13.1.  An  instructor  qualified  pilot  or  aircraft  commander  will  make  all  takeoffs and landings during: A10.5.13.1.1.  Aircraft emergencies. A10.5.13.1.2.  Assault  or  substandard  airfield  operations.    Exception:  Instructors providing upgrade training, receiving an evaluation, gaining currency, or proficiency. A10.5.13.1.3.  Situations  when  in  the  opinion  of  the  aircraft  commander,  marginal conditions exist. A10.5.14.  Simulated Emergency Procedures. A10.5.14.1.  Perform  emergency  procedures  which  require  simulating  an  engine(s) shutdown,  or  placing  switches  in  other  than  their  normal  positions,  or  an  abnormal configuration, only during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner is in one of the pilot seats.  Instructor pilot candidates who occupy a pilot seat  and  are  under  the  supervision  of  a  flight  examiner  pilot  (not  in  a  pilot  seat)  may practice  simulated  emergency  procedures  during  initial  or  re-qualification  upgrade evaluations.  Preface all simulated emergencies with the word ―simulated‖ and terminate simulated emergencies when an actual emergency arises. A10.5.14.2.  When  conducting  simulated  engine(s)  out  training,  the  flight  engineer  will post  actual  charted  minimum  control  speed  on  the  TOLD  card.    Comply  with  Dash  -1 guidance for Simulated Engine Failure adjustments to Vmca. (Chap 3).  During simulated 3-engine  takeoff  operations,  takeoff  speed  will  be  adjusted  for  minimum  control  speed.  The  instructor  pilot  should  strive  to  maintain  zero  to  positive  torque  on  the  simulated shutdown  engine(s).    More  detailed  information  is  contained  in  chapter  three  of  the applicable -1.  C-130J pilots will reference the minimum control speeds through Tab data or  the  CNI.    Turns  into  the  simulated  inoperative  engine(s)  should  be  minimized  when possible. A10.5.15.  Prohibited In-flight Maneuvers.  The following maneuvers will not be practiced or demonstrated in-flight: A10.5.15.1.  Rudder force reversals (fin stalls). A10.5.15.2.  Spins. A10.5.15.3.  Simulated runaway trim malfunctions. A10.5.15.4.  Simulated hydraulic system loss by  turning engine driven hydraulic pumps off. A10.5.16.  Flight  Maneuvers.    The  maneuvers  listed  in  Table  A10.3.  are  authorized  for qualification and continuation training (or formal upgrade training where indicated).  Certain maneuvers will only be performed during formal training under direct IP supervision.  They AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 171 are applicable to all C-130 aircraft.  Aircraft commanders will ensure their crews are advised of the maneuvers being flown.  The intent is to eliminate confusion or concern over unusual procedures that might not be anticipated.  Good communication is a matter of discipline and common sense. A10.5.16.1.  Instructor  Supervision.    Operational  Restrictions  that  require  instructor supervision  may  be  satisfied  with  the  instructor  observing  the  event  over  the  shoulder.  The instructor will be in the seat for all events that require direct instructor supervision. Table A10.3.  Operational Restrictions.

Any  crewmember  detecting  the  illumination  of  the  radar  altimeter  Low Altitude  warning  light  (C-130J,  Special  Alert)  will  notify  the  pilot  flying  the  aircraft.  Terrain  clearance  and  aircraft  position  must  be  verified.    Aircraft  commander  will  brief radar altimeter advisory calls for low-level flights. A10.5.17.2.  The navigator/CSO and pilot will use the same radar altimeter setting unless briefed otherwise. A10.5.17.3.  (C-130E/H)  The  radar  altimeter  will  be  set  to  the  HAT/HAA  during instrument approaches. A10.5.17.4.  (C-130J)  The  RADALT  reference  will  be  set  to  HAT  minus  50  feet  for precision approaches A10.5.17.5.  Two radar altimeters are required for C-130J CAT II ILS. A10.5.17.6.  (C-130J)  Normally  set  the  RADALT  to  250  for  non-precision  approaches and 300 for circling approaches. A10.5.17.7.  The radar altimeter will be set at the pilot’s discretion for VFR patterns. A10.5.18.  Chaff  and  Flare  Operations.    Conduct  the  following  procedures  after  the  live firing of chaff and flares: A10.5.18.1.  After  landing,  taxi  to  the  de-arm  area  or  another  suitable  safe  location  to check for hung ordnance. A10.5.18.2.  The  loadmaster  or  another  qualified  crewmember  will  deplane  the  aircraft and check all flare dispensers for hung ordnance.  Note: The mid-fuselage dispensers can be visually checked by opening the paratroop doors.  (Eye protection is required prior to opening  the  paratroop  door.)  The  forward  dispensers  must  be  checked  by  deplaning  a crewmember. A10.5.18.2.1.  ALE-40/47  or  flare  squibs  that  fail  to  fire  are  not  considered  hung ordnance. A10.5.18.3.  If  hung  ordnance  is  found,  identified  by  a  protruding  or  partially  ejected flare  cartridge,  the  aircraft  will  remain  in  a  de-arm  area  until  Explosive  Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel meet the aircraft.  The aircraft must remain in the designated safe area until EOD personnel can clear all hung ordnance. A10.5.18.4.  If  hung  ordnance  is  not  found,  the  aircraft  can  proceed  to  the  parking location. A10.5.19.  Descent.    Prior  to  descent  into  unfamiliar  areas,  appropriate  terrain  charts (Operational Navigation Chart (ONC), Sectional Aeronautical Chart, Tactical Pilotage Chart (TPC), or Joint Operations Graphic (JOG)) should be reviewed to increase aircrew situational awareness  of  obstructions.    The  C-130J  Global  Digital  Map  with  the  appropriate  charts loaded  meets  this  requirement.    Primary  crewmembers  will  not  be  involved  in  duties  other than aircraft operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required checklist items from the initial descent point to landing. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 175 A10.5.20.  Touch  and  Go  Landings.    Touch  and  go  landings  can  only  be  performed  by certified  individuals.    Refer  to  AFI  11-2FT  Vol.  1,  for  specific  certification  requirements.  Include type of touch and go as part of the briefing, (i.e., ground-idle or flight-idle).  Use 900 TIT minimum during touch and go‘s (C-130H and variants). A10.5.21.  Windmill Taxi Starts, Buddy Starts, and 3-Engine Takeoffs. A10.5.21.1.  Actual Windmill taxi and buddy starts, dictated by operational requirements, may  be  authorized  by  the  OG/CC  to  meet  specific  mission  requirements.    (N/A  for  C-130J). A10.5.21.1.1.  Windmill  taxi  starts,  for  training,  may  be  accomplished  during  pilot proficiency  training  without  further  approval.    Comply  with  all  T.O.  –1  restrictions and those contained in this instruction. A10.5.21.2.  Actual 3-Engine takeoffs require specific approval from AFMC/A3. A10.5.22.  Ground  Proximity  Warning  System  (GPWS)  /  Ground  Collision  Avoidance System (GCAS) A10.5.22.1.  For operations in day VMC conditions, with terrain and obstacles clearly in sight,  the  PF  will  call  runway  and/or  terrain  in  sight,  state  intentions  and  visually  clear terrain. A10.5.22.2.  For operations at night or in IMC, if an aural warning is heard, immediately and simultaneously rotate the aircraft to establish a climb while rolling wings level, and add  maximum  power  until  the  warning  has  ceased  and  adequate  terrain  clearance  is verified.    WARNING:  Do  not  delay  pull-up  for  diagnosis  of  the  low  altitude  warning.  Failure  to  roll  wings  level  during  the  maneuver  described  above  will  decrease  stall margin at heavy aircraft gross weights. A10.5.22.3.  Ensure  the  mode  of  the  GPWS/GCAS  is  commensurate  with  the  aircraft‘s phase of flight. A10.5.23.  Traffic  Advisory  and  Collision  Avoidance  System  (TCAS).    Operate  the  TCAS with  sensitivity  set  to  Traffic  Advisory/Resolution  Advisory  (TA/RA)  to  the  maximum extent  possible.    ATC  procedures  and  the ―see  and  avoid  concept‖  will  continue  to  be  the primary means of ensuring aircraft separation.  Pilots shall not deviate from an assigned ATC clearance based solely on TA information.  Attempt to attain visual contact and maintain safe separation.    However,  if  visual  separation  with  the  intruding  traffic  cannot  be  assured,  it  is imperative  to  follow  resolution  advisories  (RA)  to  obtain  aircraft  separation  computed  by TCAS.    Failure  to  follow  the  computed  RA  may  increase  the  probability  of  a    midair collision.  Do not exceed aircraft structural limits or safe flight speed in order to follow the RA.    Always  attempt  to  visually  clear  the  airspace  before  maneuvering  your  airplane  in response to a TCAS advisory.  Advise ATC as soon as practical when a deviation becomes necessary due to a TCAS resolution advisory. A10.5.24.  Systems Operations Guidelines A10.5.24.1.  Objectives A10.5.24.1.1.  A  fully  mission  capable  aircraft  is  the  ultimate  objective  of  the logistics effort.   The final  responsibility regarding  equipment required for a mission 176 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 rests  with  the  aircraft  commander.    If  one  aircraft  commander  accepts  an  aircraft  to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that aircraft commander, or a different aircraft commander, to subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative.  When the aircraft commander considers  an  item  essential,  designate  the  component  mission  essential  (ME)  on  the AFTO Form 781, and the item will be repaired or replaced prior to departure. A10.5.24.1.2.  Engine  performance,  aircraft  attitude,  vertical  velocity  indications, altitude, airspeed, and heading instruments should be operative in both pilot positions.  For  instruments  with  both  analog  and  digital  displays,  as  a  minimum  the  analog portion must be operational.  (Exception: the radar altimeter may have either analog or digital readouts operational.) A10.5.24.2.  Minimum Equipment List Guidance.  Command operating guidelines list the equipment and systems normally considered essential for routine operations.  This list is not  inclusive  of  all  equipment  or  systems  essential  to  airworthiness.    The  aircraft commander is the approving authority for operations with degraded equipment and needs no  further  approval.    This  section  provides  guidance  on  how  to  operate  with inoperative/degraded equipment.   The Minimum Equipment  List (MEL) shall not  direct deviation  from  the  aircraft  flight  manual  limitations,  emergency  procedures  or USAF/AFMC  directives.    The  diversity  of  C-130  variants  flown  by  this  command complicates the task of balancing operational reliability with safe mission completion.  C-130  Category  specific  guidance  will  be  defined  in  the  tables  below.    If  there  is  no category  listed,  the  restriction  applies  to  all  applicable  versions.    C-130J:    Unless otherwise  noted,  when  the  item  is  duplicated  on  a  soft  panel  (switch  or  indication),  the number required may be satisfied by either location.  For partial or complete hard panel failures, aircrews may revert to soft panel operations.  Normally, if a soft panel is selected due to hard panel failure, it should be used for the remainder of the flight. A10.5.24.2.1.  If, after exploring all options, the aircraft commander determines that a safe flight is possible with an item listed below inoperative (beyond the scope listed here) a waiver shall be requested through channels to AFMC/A3V.  Phone or e-mail methods are appropriate.  Any inoperative item  not  covered in  this publication shall be  assessed  by  the  aircraft  commander  and  crew.    If  a  safe  flight  can  be accomplished, no further action is necessary.  Exceptions for degraded operations is not indefinite  period  with systems/subsystems inoperative. for  continued  operations  over  an intended A10.5.24.3.  Navigation Systems. A10.5.24.3.1.  For  flights  in  Minimum  Navigation  Performance  Specifications (MNPS) airspace in the North Atlantic region or the Composite Hawaii/mainland US Route  System,  the  following  fully  operable  navigation  systems  are  considered  the minimum necessary to permit compliance.

When  two  systems  are  installed,  both  should  be operational.    If  one  system  fails,  refer  to  the  flight  manual  to  determine  what  other equipment  is  affected.    One  compass  and  one  aligned  inertial  system  is  acceptable.  The  C-130  standby  compass  is  not  considered  a  separate  source  for  the  purposes  of this paragraph. A10.5.24.3.4.  For  flights  on  all  other  Category  I  routes,  the  aircraft  commander determines  the  minimum  navigational  capability  required  to  safely  accomplish  the mission. A10.5.24.3.5.  Equipment listed in FLIP AP/2 for permitting compliance with MNPS is mandatory.  Loss of any component before track entry requires a return to station with maintenance capability or re-file via specified routes. A10.5.24.3.6.  Comply  with  all  GATM  requirements  as  directed.

Note: The primary concern with inoperative fuel boost pumps or quantity indicators is fuel balance  and wing loading.  Degraded operation is permissible, however, flight crews must consider potentially  trapped fuel and decreased range should further degradation occur. Item/System Installed  Operational  Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions Main Tank Fuel Pumps Main Tank Dump Pumps 4 4 4 4  On aircraft equipped with dump mast shutoff  valve switches, one main tank fuel boost pump  may be inoperative for flight to a repair facility  provided the respective fuel dump pump is operational. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 181 Auxiliary Tank Fuel Pumps (per tank) 1 0 External Tank Fuel Pumps (per tank) (if tank contains f uel) 2 1 Auxiliary tank fuel pumps should be operational  for any tank containing fuel If one external tank boost pump is inoperative,  fuel within that tank will be trapped should the  second boost pump fail.  Fuel balancing with the opposite tank will then be necessary resulting in a reduction of usable fuel. 182 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 Main Fuel Quantity  Indicator (enroute) (Notes: 1 and 2) 4 2 One main tank indicator may be inoperative  provided: Both the tank with the inoperative indicator and  its symmetrical tank quantity are verified by use  of a fuel tank dipstick.  The fuel tank did stick is  calibrated for JP-4.  Use with other fuels is  inaccurate for reading pounds of fuel quantity.  At enroute stops when engines are shut down,  the tank with the inoperative indicator and the symmetrically opposite tank will be dip checked  Crossfeed operations will begin when the  symmetrically opposite quantity indicator has decreased to 1,500 lbs. (inboard) and 2,500 lbs.  (outboard).  For tanker aircraft (HC-130P/N) begin crossfeed when any main  tank decreases to 2,000 lbs. Engine out training using the engine corresponding to the inoperative indicator or its  symmetrical opposite will not be conducted  during tank to engine operations. Flights consisting of multiple stops when the  profile e does not allow dipping the tanks will  terminate with a minimum of 8,000 lbs. calculated main tank fuel. Two main tank indicators may be inoperative  provided they are not symmetrical tanks or on  the same wing. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 183 Local training flights may be conducted with  two inoperative main tank indicators provided:  Inoperative indicators are asymmetrical. Main tank fuel quantity is visually verified  using the fuel tank dip stick. Engine out training is not performed unless all  engines are on crossfeed from auxiliary or  external tanks with operative indicators  Symmetrical engine flow is maintained. Mission will terminate with a minimum of  8,000 lbs. calculated main tank fuel. One external fuel tank indicator may be inoperative provided both external fuel tanks  are checked full or empty. Both external fuel tank indicators may be  inoperative provided both external tanks are  verified empty.  When an external tank  indicator is inoperative and the tank cannot be  visually checked empty due to foam modification, comply with the following prior  to flight: Check pressure with each pump in the external  tank.  If no pressure is obtained, the tank is  verified empty. If pressure is obtained, ground transfer the fuel  from the external tank.  Defuel the external tank  if unable to ground transfer. When unable to verify an external tank is empty  prior to engine start, the tank will be placed on  crossfeed until no pressure is obtained.  This  will be completed prior to takeoff. If the fuel quantity indicator is inoperative, fuel  quantity will be verified with the magnetic sight  gage.

This  attachment,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives,  outlines procedures  for  operation  of  the  C-135  aircraft  under  most  circumstances.    AFMC  aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all C-135 aircraft must comply with the  outlined  requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this  attachment.  Operations  or  procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished  if  they  enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment. A11.2.  Mission Planning. A11.2.1.  Aircrew  Qualification.    Primary  crewmembers  or  those  occupying  a  primary position  during  flight  must  be  basic-qualified  or  in  training  for  qualification  for  that  crew position. If non-current, or in training for a particular event, the crewmember must be under the supervision of an instructor while accomplishing that event (direct supervision for critical phases of flight).  Exceptions are IAW with AFI 11-401/AFMC S1. A11.2.1.1.  Pilots: A11.2.1.1.1.  Missions with passengers.  Only a pilot that is qualified and current will occupy  a  pilot’s  seat  with  passengers  onboard  the  aircraft.  One  of  the  following conditions must be met: A11.2.1.1.1.1.  Two qualified and current pilots must be at the controls. Or, A11.2.1.1.1.2.  A  qualified  pilot  regaining  currency,  a  basic-qualified  receiving difference, conversion, or mission training; and an IP providing direct supervision must be at the controls. A11.2.1.2.  Other  crewmembers:  Non-current  or  unqualified  navigators/CSOs,  flight engineers,  systems  operators,  flight  attendants,  boom  operators  or  avionics  flight technicians may perform in their primary crew position on any mission when supervised by a qualified instructor of like specialty. A11.2.2.  Crew Complement.  Minimum aircrew complement for basic and augmented  FDP will  be  commensurate  with  the  applicable  T.O.  1C-135X(X)X-1  Flight  Manual,  applicable Partial/Modification Flight Manual and Table A11.1.

Note 2: One Navigator/CSO, flight engineer, and communications system operator satisfies augmented crew member requirements for Speckled Trout executive airlift missions.   Note 3:  One boom operator satisfies augmented crewmember requirements during non-tanker executive airlift missions.   Note 4: Two FAs will be the basic crew complement for all Speckled Trout executive airlift missions.  No FAs are required on local missions with 10 or fewer passengers, provided another crew member trained in passenger handling is aboard and designated as passenger monitor.  FAs are not required in the absence of passengers.   A11.2.2.1.  The  unit  commander  will  designate  additional  crewmembers  if  the  mission complexity  or  priority  dictates,  or  to  meet  navigator/CSO  or  other  crew  position currency/training requirements. A11.2.2.2.  Augmented  crews  are  required  when  a  mission  cannot  be  safely  completed within a basic flight duty period.  Augmentees must be basic-qualified in accordance with AFI  11-2FTV1,  Flight  Test  Aircrew  Training. those  situations  requiring augmentation,  the  crew  must  be  augmented  from  the  start  of  the  duty  period.  If augmentees are added to the crew, the crew’s flight duty period will be computed based on the flight duty period of the most limited person.   In A11.2.3.  Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements. See Table 2.1. In all cases ensure obstacle clearance requirements are met. Landing distance will not exceed runway available. Crews will normally use 0.80 delayed braking factor (DBF) for computing landing distance. The pilot in command may direct using greater than 0.80 DBF as an exception on a case by case basis, but must be aware of the resultant increase in brake wear.  OG/CC or equivalent approval is required for landing with greater than a 0.90 DBF.  When using greater than 0.80 DBF  crews  will  brief  the  planned  braking  speed.  .    For  RC/TC/WC-135  aircraft,  it  is permissible to use 95% delayed braking factor when deciding 30 flap total landing distance on planned touch and go landings. A11.2.3.1.  Runway  Length  for  Takeoff  and  Intersection  Takeoffs.  Normally,  takeoffs will  be  initiated  from  the  beginning  of  the  approved  usable  portion  of  the  runway.  Intersection takeoffs are authorized if the following conditions are met: AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 201 A11.2.3.1.1.  Pilots  may  accomplish  intersection  takeoffs  provided  the  operating environment  (i.e.,  gross  weight,  obstructions,  climb  criteria,  weather,  etc.)  allows  a safe  takeoff  and  departure.    Calculate  takeoff  performance  based  on  the  runway remaining from the point at which the takeoff is initiated.  In no case will a takeoff be made from a position where less than 7000 feet of runway remains. A11.2.3.2.  During  operations  on  runways  partially  covered  with  snow  or  ice,  takeoff computations  will  be  based  on  the  reported  RSC  or  RCR  for  the  cleared  portion  of  the runway.  A  minimum  of  50  feet  either  side  of  centerline  should  be  cleared.  If  50  feet either side of centerline is not cleared, then compute data based on the un-cleared portion up to 50 feet either side of centerline. A11.2.4.  Operations over Runway Cables (does not include recessed cables). A11.2.4.1.  Do  not  land  on  (touchdown  on)  approach  end  arresting  cables  (does  not include recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower to have the cable inspected. A11.2.4.2.  Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, ATIS, or ATC. A11.2.5.  Minimum Runway Condition Report (RCR). A11.2.5.1.  Operations  from  RAF  Fairford  and  RAF  Mildenhall.    An  RCR  15  may  be used  for  computing  takeoff  performance  for  all  operational  and  training  missions  when wet  runway  conditions  exist.    This  authorization  does  not  apply  to  landing  data computations or when standing water is on the runway.  Determination of standing water versus wet runway conditions will be made by the 100 OG/CC. A11.2.6.  Non-Standard Fuel Loads.  For depot operations, after the initial PDM FCF landing fuel load may be left “as is” when fuel CG is in the range of 24-28%.  This will result in a non-standard fuel load.  Mission planning must take into account both the non-standard fuel load and FCF checks to be accomplished to ensure that the fuel is available and accessible in case of emergency and or divert. A11.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A11.3.1.  Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC). Use ERCC procedures when necessary to expedite aircraft movement or permit the exchange of crewmembers.  Pilot in command must assess  prevailing  weather,  lighting  and  parking  location  to  ensure  safe  operations.    Unless otherwise published, use the following procedures: A11.3.1.1.  Pilot in command will brief crewmembers on the intended ERCC operation to include their locations, duties, and responsibilities during the ERCC. A11.3.1.2.  Crewmembers should ensure that all loose items are secure prior to entering and exiting the aircraft. A11.3.1.3.  The  parking  brake  will  be  set  and  at  least  one  pilot  in  the  seat  will  monitor brakes, interphone, and radio. A11.3.1.4.  Use terrain and taxi lights to enhance safety at night as the situation dictates. 202 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A11.3.1.5.  A  crewmember  should  be  positioned  at  the  point  of  entry  to  act  as  a  safety observer. A11.3.1.6.  No enplaning personnel should approach the airplane until the crewmember is in place. A11.3.1.7.  Crewmembers should approach and depart the aircraft from the nose.  When departing  crewmembers  will  proceed  forward  of  the  aircraft  at  least  50  feet  before turning. A11.3.1.8.  Brief deplaning personnel to secure loose articles and remain forward of the interphone cord. A11.3.1.9.  Pilot in command will ensure that the aircraft is clear prior to taxi. A11.3.2.  Formation  Flying.    Formation  is  authorized  IAW  applicable  technical  order  and AFI 11-2KC135Volume 3, C/KC-135 Operating Procedures or AFI 11-2RC-135Volume 3, RC/OC/WC/TC-135 Operating Procedures. A11.3.3.  Air Refueling Limitations. A11.3.3.1.  Do not accomplish AR operations when: A11.3.3.1.1.  Conditions  result  in  marginal  control  of  either  aircraft  or  boom  (in  the opinion of either PIC or BO). A11.3.3.1.2.  Either the tanker or the receiver has less than the full number of engines operating (except B-52). A11.3.3.1.3.  The tanker aircraft is unable to retract the landing gear. A11.3.3.1.4.  Pod Control Panel malfunction exists that cannot be resolved. A11.3.3.1.5.  MPRS pod malfunction. Note: If Pod Control Panel is operational and only one pod is malfunctioning, AR is permissible with operational pod. A11.3.3.2.  Tanker  Autopilot.    If  a  tanker  pilot  or  receiver  pilot  is  required  to  fly autopilot-off  for  qualification  training,  the  pilot  flying  the  opposing  aircraft  will  be qualified.    Verbal  notification  and  acknowledgment  will  take  place  between  the  tanker and receiver prior to conducting autopilot-off training. A11.3.3.3.  A/R  without  Tanker  Disconnect  Capability.  A/R  without  tanker  disconnect capability  means  the  boom  operator  cannot  trigger  an  immediate  disconnect.  After  a known loss of tanker disconnect capability with a particular receiver, no further contacts will  be  attempted  with  that  receiver.  The  inability  to  get  an  immediate  disconnect  from one  receiver  by  triggering  a  disconnect  does  not  prohibit  contact  attempts  with  other receivers, if the tanker system (signal coil) checks good. However, if disconnects cannot be triggered on two successive receivers, no further contacts will be attempted. A11.3.3.3.1.  Exceptions to the restrictions are: A11.3.3.3.1.1.  During fuel emergency situations. A11.3.3.3.1.2.  When  necessary  to  complete  receiver  over-water  deployment  or redeployment. A11.3.3.3.1.3.  Operational missions. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 203 A11.3.3.4.  Manual/Emergency Boom Latch Training. The following conditions must be met in order to complete training or an evaluation in manual /emergency boom latching: A11.3.3.4.1.  An AR IP must be at a set of controls during the receiver contacts. A11.3.3.4.2.  Contacts will be limited to the minimum required. A11.3.3.4.3.  The  receiver  aircraft  AR  system  must  be  fully  operable,  and  a disconnect  capability  with  the  receiver  must  have  been  previously  determined  by  a boom operator initiated disconnect. A11.3.3.5.  Prohibited  Refueling  Maneuvers.  When  operating  in  manual/emergency boom  latching or when the tanker does not  have disconnect  capability, limit  contacts  to the  minimum  number  necessary  to  complete  mission  requirements.    The  following maneuvers are prohibited: A11.3.3.5.1.  Practice emergency separation while in contact. A11.3.3.5.2.  Demonstration of envelope limits. A11.3.3.6.  Practice Emergency Separations. A11.3.3.6.1.  Prior to the actual accomplishment of a practice emergency separation, coordination between the tanker pilot, boom operator, and receiver pilot is mandatory. Coordination  must  include  when  the  separation  will  occur  and  who  will  give  the command  of  execution.  Tanker  pilot  coordination  may  be  accomplished  over interphone with the boom operator. A11.3.3.6.2.  If  separation  is  initiated  from  the  contact  position,  the  receiver’s  A/R system  must  be  in  normal,  and  a  boom  operator  disconnect  capability  with  the receiver must exist. A11.3.3.6.3.  Practice  emergency  separations  will  not  be  accomplished  with passengers on board unless passengers are seated with seat belts fastened. A11.3.3.7.  Limits Demonstration. Prior to a limits demonstration, a disconnect capability must have been previously determined by a boom operator initiated disconnect. A11.3.3.8.  Receiver  AR  Training.    A  qualified  and  current  receiver  IP  will  conduct training. The receiver pilot must inform and obtain acknowledgment from the tanker pilot and boom operator when an unqualified receiver pilot is receiving AR training.  A boom operator  qualified  for  the  applicable  category  receiver  must  operate  the  boom  controls, and if the tanker autopilot is off, the tanker must be flown by a pilot current and qualified in tanker AR. A11.3.3.9.  Altitude. A/R operations are normally conducted above 12,000 feet MSL, or 10,000  feet  AGL,  whichever  is  higher.  A/R  operations  based  at  or  above  12,000  feet MSL  which  momentarily  fall  below  10,000  feet  AGL,  but  not  lower  than  5,000  feet AGL, due to overflight of mountain ridges, peaks, etc., are authorized. A/R operations in support of C-130 receivers at the receiver's optimum refueling altitude, but no lower than 5,000 feet AGL are authorized. A/R performed below those altitudes will only be on an approved  test  plan  or  for  other  operational  considerations  approved  by  the  OG/CC. Except as noted above, A/R operations below 6,000 feet AGL is considered Low Altitude Air Refueling (LAAR) and must comply with the following: 204 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A11.3.3.9.1.  Consideration  will  be  given  to  wearing  helmets  with  visor  down  for protection against bird strikes. When available, a boom mike may be used to facilitate cross-cockpit communications. A11.3.3.9.2.  A  knowledgeable  safety  observer  will  be  used  to  the  maximum  extent possible. A11.3.3.9.3.  Maximum time per sortie for LAAR will be 1 hour. A11.3.3.9.4.  Perform during day, under VFR conditions. A11.3.3.9.5.  Minimum  altitude  is  3,000  feet  above  the  highest  obstacle  or  terrain within 4 NM of course centerline. A11.3.3.9.6.  Forecast, reported, or observed winds less than or equal to 27 knots. A11.3.3.9.7.  Less than forecast, reported or observed moderate turbulence. A11.3.3.9.8.  Over  flat  and  rolling  terrain  or  a  minimum  of  10  NM  from  land  over contiguous water. A11.3.3.9.9.  The  autopilot  rudder  axis  or  yaw  damper  will  be  used  if  functioning. Consideration will be given to not utilizing the other axes of the autopilot based upon maneuvering requirements. A11.3.3.9.10.  Flight manual restrictions for low altitude operations will be complied with. A11.4.  Instrument Procedures. A11.4.1.  Aircraft Category.  The C-135 is approach category D. A11.4.2.  Traffic  Advisory  and  Collision  Avoidance  System  (TCAS).  Operate  the  TCAS with  sensitivity  set  to  Traffic  Advisory/Resolution  Advisory  (TA/RA)  to  the  maximum extent  possible.    ATC  procedures  and  the  “see  and  avoid  concept”  will  continue  to  be  the primary means of ensuring aircraft separation. Pilots shall not deviate from an assigned ATC clearance based solely on TA information.  Attempt to attain visual contact and maintain safe separation.    However,  if  visual  separation  with  the  intruding  traffic  cannot  be  assured,  it  is imperative  to  follow  resolution  advisories  (RA)  to  obtain  aircraft  separation  computed  by TCAS.    Failure  to  follow  the  computed  RA  may  increase  the  probability  of  a  midair collision.  Do not exceed aircraft structural limits or safe flight speed in order to follow the RA.  Always  attempt  to  visually  clear  the  airspace  before  maneuvering  your  airplane  in response to a TCAS advisory.  Advise ATC as soon as practical when a deviation becomes necessary due to a TCAS resolution advisory. A11.4.3.  Enhanced  Ground  Proximity  Warning  System  (E-GPWS)  and/or  Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS).  When operating in the low altitude structure, it is imperative to  follow E-GPWS advisories. Advise ATC as soon as practical  when deviation from an ATC clearance is directed by E-GPWS/TAWS. A11.4.4.  Aircraft Systems Operations and Navigation Procedures A11.4.4.1.  MFD. Pilot Flying (PF) must have a MFD with the full ADI for all takeoffs, final  approaches  and  landings.    Course  guidance  (other  than  stick  map)  appropriate  for AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 205 the  current  ATC  clearance,  will  be  displayed  on  a  PF  MFD.    Exception:  When malfunctions limit the pilot to a single operable MFD. A11.4.4.2.  Weather Radar. Configure the weather radar based on mission requirements.  For  Pacer  CRAG:  The  Predictive  Wind  Shear  (PWS)  function  of  the  weather  radar should normally be operating for all takeoffs, approaches, and landings. A11.4.4.3.  Flight Progress. A11.4.4.3.1.  Prior  to  flight,  plot  the  oceanic  portion  of  the  flight  on  an  appropriate chart. Annotate the chart with the mission number, AC's name, preparer’s name, and date. If practical, chart may be reused. A11.4.4.3.2.  The PIC will ensure the navigation waypoints loaded in the INS (FMS for  Pacer  CRAG)  flight  plan  accurately  reflect  the  intended/cleared  route  of  flight.  This can be done using one or more of the following methods: A11.4.4.3.2.1.  Latitude/longitude from current FLIP A11.4.4.3.2.2.  Bearing/distance  from  a  flight  plan  after  latitude/longitude  are verified for each waypoint. A11.4.4.3.2.3.  Ground Based NAVAIDS. A11.4.4.3.3.  In-Flight,  use  all  available  NAVAIDS  to  monitor  INS  performance. Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability, which degrades centerline  accuracy  to  the  controlling  ARTCC.  Use  the  following  procedures  for flight progress: A11.4.4.3.4.  Obtain a coast out fix prior to, or immediately on entering the Category I  Route  or  over-water  segment.  Perform  a  gross  error  check  using  available NAVAIDs and annotate the position and time on the chart. A11.4.4.3.5.  When  approaching  each  waypoint,  recheck  coordinates  for  the  next waypoint. A11.4.4.3.6.  Approximately 10 minutes after passing each oceanic waypoint, record and  plot  the  aircraft  position  and  time  on  the  chart,  and  ensure  compliance  with courses and ETA tolerances. A11.4.4.3.7.  If a revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight on the chart. A11.4.4.3.8.  For  Pacer  CRAG,  periodically  check  all  solution  position  differentials on the INAV pages. A11.4.4.3.9.  Reduced  Vertical  Separation  Minimum  (RVSM)  Airspace.  Airspace where RVSM is applied is considered special qualification airspace.  See FLIP GP for aircraft equipment requirements.  Both the operator and the specific aircraft must be approved for operations in these areas.  Always refer to the appropriate Area Planning (AP) publication for specific theater RVSM requirements. A11.4.4.3.10.  Required  Navigation  Performance  (RNP)  Airspace.  Airspace  where RNP is applied is considered special qualification airspace. Both the operator and the specific  aircraft  type  must  be  approved  for  operations  in  these  areas.    The  PIC  is 206 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 responsible  for  a  thorough  review  of  the  aircraft  forms  and  maintenance  logs  to ascertain  the  status  of  RNP  equipment.    Document  (in  the  aircraft  forms) malfunctions  or  failures  of  RNP  required  equipment,  including  the  failure  of  this equipment to meet RNP tolerances. A11.4.4.3.10.1.  RNP-10. Compliance includes navigation accuracy within 10NM of  actual  position  95%  of  the  time.  Aircraft  not  possessing  integrated  GPS  with receiver  autonomous  integrity  monitoring  (RAIM),  or  equivalent  system,  are limited in how long they may operate in RNP-10 airspace.  See FLIP for RPN-10 long  term  requirements/aircraft  capabilities.  KC-135  aircraft  with  properly functioning  steering  solutions  may  operate  in  RNP-10  airspace  without  time limitations.    If  the  capability  to  update  the  inertial  navigation  solution  with  the GPS is lost, or if the receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) is lost, the aircraft is  limited to  6.2 hours of operation in  RNP-10 airspace after the GPS or RAIM is degraded. A11.4.4.3.10.2.  Enroute. At least two long-range navigation systems certified for RNP-10 must be operational at the oceanic entry point.  Periodic crosschecks will be  accomplished  to  identify  navigation  errors  and  prevent  inadvertent  deviation from  ATC  cleared  routes.  Advise  ATC  of  the  deterioration  or  failure  of navigation equipment below navigation performance requirements and coordinate appropriate actions. A11.4.4.3.11.  Basic  Area  Navigation  (BRNAV)  Airspace.  BRNAV  is  defined  as RNAV with an accuracy that meets RNP-5 for operations under IFR in that European airspace  designated  for  BRNAV/RNP-5  operations.  When  operating  in  BRNAV airspace, aircrews will immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails, or is unable to meet BRNAV tolerances. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment including the failure of this equipment to meet BRNAV tolerances.  The KC-135 is approved for BRNAV operations. A11.4.4.3.12.  MNPS  Airspace  Operations.  Operations  within  the  North  Atlantic area’s  MNPS  airspace,  Canadian  MNPS,  or  selected  Pacific  routes  are  designed  for INS-auto-pilot  coupled  operation.  (See  FLIP  AP/2,  chapter  5  and  AFI  11-202V3). When  not  engaged  in  AR  operations,  aircrews  will  adhere  to  these  procedures. Comply  with  FLIP  for  operations in  North  Atlantic  Minimum  Navigation Performance  Specification  Airspace,  and  US  West  Coast  to  Hawaii  Route  System Procedures. A11.4.4.3.12.1.  Malfunctioning  equipment  that  reduces  the  aircrew’s  capability to comply with MNPS, whether occurring prior to, or within MNPS airspace, will immediately  be  reported  to  the  controlling  agency  and  subsequent  agencies throughout  the route of  flight.  Prior to  airspace entry, aircrews will return to  the nearest  maintenance  repair  facility  unless  the  aircraft  has  a  minimum  of  two operable  and  correctly  functioning  INUs,  unless  specifically  cleared  to  proceed along original, or revised routing by the controlling agency. If subsequent failures occur, advise ARTCC, comply with track restrictions, and use all means available (HF DR, dead reckoning, etc) to ensure navigation accuracy. A11.4.4.3.12.2.  When  flying  in  MNPS  airspace,  exercise  special  caution  to AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 207 ensure the coordinates of the assigned track and associated landfall and domestic routings  are  fully  understood  and  correctly  inserted  into  the  automatic  DR navigation  system  with  appropriate  cross-checks.  If  at  any  time  the  route  (re-routing, if appropriate) is in doubt, check the details with ARTCC facility. A11.4.4.3.12.3.  When  flying  in  MNPS  airspace,  crews  will  utilize  Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP) to the max extent possible. Refer to the MNPS Manual and AFI 11-217 for further information on SLOP. A11.4.4.3.13.  Inoperative  Navigation  Systems  (Oceanic  systems  include:  INU-1, INU-2, and GPS with RAIM). A11.4.4.3.13.1.  One  unit  inoperative:    Advise  ARTCC  unless  within  range  of normal radio aids.  Plot position on navigation chart every 30 minutes.  Check the accuracy of remaining nav systems, using all available NAVAIDs. A11.4.4.3.13.2.  Two  units  inoperative:    Advise  ARTCC.    Cross-check  compass system heading with mission plan at each waypoint or every 30 minutes.  Verify last recorded position on chart.  Use flight plan as guide.  Use ADF, VOR/DME, weather  radar  ground  mapping  mode,  to  update  estimated  positions.    If  desired and other methods fail, try to obtain an HF DF fix. This service can be requested through the regular ARTCC frequencies. A11.4.4.3.13.3.  Differences  Between  Navigation  Systems.  When  there  is  a difference between navigation systems, normally two of the three will be in close proximity, so that it will be simple to determine that the malfunctioning system is the one, which is most distant from the other two. When available, check position using available ground NAVAIDs. Comparing the doppler groundspeed with the groundspeed  derived  from  each  system  may  also  provide  a  good  indication  of  a malfunctioning system. A11.4.5.  RNAV Operations. A11.4.5.1.  KC-135R  (BLK  40)  (IAW  FAA  AC  90-100A  and  KC-135  (BLK  40) airworthiness  certification)  aircraft  are  approved  for  unrestricted  RNAV/RNP  1, RNAV/P-RNAV/RNP  2,  NAV/RNP  4,  BRNAV,  RNP  operations  and  RNP  0.3,  lateral navigation (LNAV) only procedures. A11.4.5.1.1.  All  pilots/navigators/CSOs  (if  applicable)  must  complete  KC135 RNAV/GPS  Operations  Certification  training  before  utilizing  RNAV  1  (SIDs  & STARs)  and  RNAV  2  ("Q"  &  "T"  routes)  airspace  or  RNP  0.3  RNAV  (LNAV minima)  approaches.    Training  requirements  are  located  on  the  AFMC/A3V  CoP.   The  AFMC  training  overview  (word  document)  provides  the  appropriate  training guidance. A11.4.5.1.2.  The KC-135 aircraft is not authorized to fly "overlay GPS approaches", due  to  concerns  about  the  ability  to  accurately  code  the  missed  approach  portion  of these  procedures.    "Overlay  GPS  approaches"  are  characterized  by  "Or  GPS"  in  the title  (i.e.  VOR  or  GPS  RWY  15),  these  approaches  are  designed  differently  from RNAV,  RNAV  (GPS)  and  GPS  approaches,  because  overlays  are  designed  around ground  based  NAVAIDs  and  interpreted  for  space  based  navigation.    This  does  not 208 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 preclude  the  use  of  "GPS  in  lieu  of"  to  define  individual  points  on  a  conventional approach, such as a final approach fix defined by an NDB for an aircraft  that is  not equipped with an NDB; crews can still use GPS to define these individual points IAW 11-217V1 paragraph 7.12.4. A11.4.5.1.3.  GPS  overlays  of  conventional  SIDs  and  STARs  found  in  aircraft database are only authorized for situational awareness and require the pilots to use the ground  based  NAVAIDs  as  their  primary  navigational  source,  where  RNAV  SIDs and STARs do not require the use of  ground based NAVAIDs. A11.4.5.1.4.  When flying RNAV SIDs KC-135 crews will accomplish a gyro takeoff and ensure pilot flying's primary course as a minimum is set to FMS.  The crew will ensure  the  flight  directors  are  set  to  NAV/LOC  to  provide  flight  director  guidance prior to reaching 500 feet AGL, IAW FAA Advisory Circular 90-100A. A11.4.5.1.5.  Flight director lateral guidance must be available anytime the KC-135 is operating  in  RNP  0.3  airspace  IAW  KC-135  (BLK  40)  performance  assessment summary. A11.4.5.1.6.  To  mitigate  KC-135  (BLK  40)  RNAV  instrument  approach  FMS  leg length  limitations,  crews  must  to  evaluate  distance-to-fly  displayed  as  the  FMS sequences to the next point against the charted value while flying RNAV approaches.  If deviations from the charted values are observed the crew should consider aborting the approach. A11.5.  Operational Procedures and Restrictions. A11.5.1.  Flight Duty Period. Observe AFI 11-202V3 restrictions, and the following: A11.5.1.1.  Basic Crew FDP. A11.5.1.1.1.  Maximum  FDP  for  a  basic  crew  is  IAW  AFI  11-202V3.  Reduce  this period to 12 hours without an operative autopilot altitude hold.   If the autopilot fails after  departure,  continue  to  the  next  scheduled  stop  and  then  comply  with  this restriction. A11.5.1.2.  Augmented Crew FDP. A11.5.1.2.1.  Maximum  FDP  for  an  augmented  crew  (operational  missions  only)  is IAW AFI 11-202V3.  Reduce this period to 16 hours without an operative autopilot altitude hold. In this case, only the pilot portion of the crew need be augmented. A11.5.1.2.2.  Basic crews will not be augmented after FDP has started. A11.5.1.2.3.  Authorized  only  for  a  maximum  of  four  intermediate  stops/sorties.  Sorties  are  defined  as  stops  for  the  purpose  of  refueling  or  stops  with  significant ground time/delay.  Waiver authority is the OG/CC. A11.5.2.  Duty  Station.    The  pilot,  copilot,  flight  engineer,  navigator/CSO,  and  boom operator will be at their duty stations during all critical phases of flight. During other phases of  flight,  crewmembers  may  leave  their  duty  station  to  meet  physiological  needs  and  to perform  normal  crew  duties.    During  cruise  flight,  the  flight  engineer,  navigator/CSO,  or boom  operator  may  leave  his/her  duty  station  for  longer  periods  with  pilot  approval. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 209 Crewmembers  will  notify  the  pilot  in  command  prior  to  departing  assigned  primary  duty stations. A11.5.2.1.  Crewmembers  performing  instructor  or  flight  examiner  duties  are  exempt from seat belt requirements if not occupying a primary crew position; however, they will have a seat available with an operable seat belt. A11.5.3.  Control  Cabin  Entry.  Pilot  in  command  may  authorize  passengers  and  observers access to the control cabin during all phases of flight. In all cases, sufficient oxygen sources must be available to  meet  the  requirements  of AFI 11-202V3. Passengers or observers will not  be  permitted  access  to  the  pilot  or  copilot  position  regardless  of  its  availability. Exceptions are IAW AFI 11-401/AFMC Sup 1. A11.5.4.  Command Radios. A11.5.4.1.  The pilot not flying the aircraft normally makes all ATC radio calls. A11.5.4.2.  In terminal areas the pilot, copilot, navigator/CSO, flight engineer, and boom operator will monitor the primary command radio unless directed otherwise. A11.5.4.3.  The  pilot  operating  the  command  radios  will  inform  the  crew  when  the primary radio is changed. A11.5.4.4.  One  pilot  should  record  and  will  acknowledge  all  ATC  clearances.  The navigator/CSO or boom operator will monitor the read-back and will ensure compliance with all clearances. A11.5.4.5.  Both  pilots  will  monitor  UHF  guard  (or  VHF  guard  when  appropriate) emergency frequency regardless of primary radio.  Exception: Only one crewmember is required  to  monitor  guard  frequency  during  tanker  or  receiver  rendezvous  and  A/R. During tanker A/R, the PNF normally monitors guard. A11.5.5.  Fuel  Jettison  Procedures.    Use  jettison  altitudes  above  20,000-feet  AGL  to  the maximum  extent  possible.    If  jettison  is  accomplished,  record  all  pertinent  data  to  include flight  conditions,  altitude,  airspeed,  air  temperature,  wind  direction  and  velocity,  type  and amount  of  fuel,  aircraft  type  and  position  at  time  of  jettison,  time  and  duration  of  jettison activity,  and  reason  jettison  was  accomplished.  Retain  this  information  for  6  months  as documentation in the event of claim against the government resulting from the fuel jettison. A11.5.6.  Qualification  Training.    Initial  qualification,  re-qualification,  or  upgrade  training for pilots will not be conducted on missions with passengers onboard. Mission qualification or mission instructor training may be conducted on missions with passengers onboard only if the individual in training is qualified (completed aircraft checkride with a valid AF Form 8). A11.5.7.  Three-Engine Ferry Operations.  Consider three-engine ferry operations only after exhausting  all  other  options  to  return  an  aircraft  with  an  inoperative  engine  to  full  mission ready  status.  Each  three-engine  ferry  sortie  must  be  approved  IAW  AFI  11-202V3  AFMC Sup. The owning MAJCOM will provide execution authority for these sorties. The following procedures apply: A11.5.7.1.  Plan  ferry  operations  well  ahead  to  allow  sufficient  time  for  completion  of maintenance preparation actions. 210 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A11.5.7.2.  Plan  the  flight  to  the  nearest  destination  possessing  a  usable  maintenance support  capability.    Obtain  clearances  and  alert  all  en  route,  alternate,  and  abort  bases along the intended route of flight. A11.5.7.3.  Use  the  minimum  crew  necessary  for  the  ferry  operation.    Do  not  carry passengers or other non-essential personnel.  Observe aircraft flight manual limitations. A11.5.7.4.  All  primary  aircraft  systems  not  associated  with  the  failed  engine  must  be fully operational. A11.5.7.5.  Performance data must satisfy takeoff field length requirements, gear down 3-engine  climb  performance,  and  final  segment  two-engine  asymmetric  go-around capability. A11.5.7.6.  Download cargo (including mission support kits) prior to ferry operations. A11.5.8.  Power  Management  Control  (PMC)  Operations.    The  pilot  in  command  may (authorize)  takeoff  with  one  PMC  inoperative.    Do  not  turn  off  an  operational  PMC  to practice  a  PMC  inoperative  takeoff.    Simulated  three-engine  approaches  and  touch-and-go landings are not authorized with a PMC inoperative. A11.5.9.  Flight  Maneuvers.    The  following  maneuvers  are  authorized  for  qualification  and continuation  training.  They  are  applicable  to  all  mission  and  series  C-135  aircraft,  except when prohibited or restricted by the flight manual, partial/modification flight manual or other applicable  directives.  Direct  instructor-pilot  (IP)  super-vision  requires  the  IP  to  have immediate  access  to  the  controls.  Comply  with  Training  Restrictions  in  Table  5.1  of  this instruction and the following: A11.5.9.1.  Simulated Engine Failure. Perform practice or simulated loss of engines IAW this instruction, the applicable flight manual. A11.5.9.2.  Approach and Landing, Simulated Engine-Out (direct IP supervision). A11.5.9.3.  Approach  and  Go-Around,  Simulated  Engine-Out  (Power  Rudder  On).    A planned three-engine go-around may be started at any time before the power is reduced in the flare. For an unplanned go-around use all four engines as soon as safe and practical. A11.5.9.4.  Approach and Go-Around, Simulated Engine-Out (Power Rudder Off) (direct IP  supervision).  This  maneuver  will  not  be  accomplished  unless  an  IP  has  briefed  the maneuver prior to flight. The go-around will be started no lower than 200 AGL. For an unplanned go-around, use all four engines as soon as safe and practical. A11.5.9.5.  Simulated Engine Failure Takeoff Continued (direct IP supervision). A11.5.9.6.  Simulated  2-Engine  Approach/Landing  (direct  IP  supervision).  May  be practiced  using  two  symmetric  engines  or  three  engines  using  two-engine  procedures. Two-engine  approaches  and  landings  will  not  be  practiced  in  an  extensively  modified aircraft.    Note:  During  a  go-around  or  missed  approach,  use  the  asymmetric  engine  as required to ensure at least a 3.3% climb gradient. A11.5.9.7.  Simulated  Jammed  Stabilizer  Demonstration  (spoiler  use  only)  (direct  IP supervision). A11.5.9.8.  Landing Attitude Demonstration (IP supervised). AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 211 A11.5.9.9.  Spoiler/Lateral Control Demonstration (IP supervised). A11.5.9.10.  Trim Demonstration (IP supervised). A11.5.10.  Touch-and-Go Landing Limitations. A11.5.10.1.  Touch  and  Go  landings  may  be  performed  under  direct  instructor  pilot supervision or by a certified mission pilot IAW this instruction, AFI 11-2FTV1, and the applicable flight manual.  Refer to AFI 11-2FT Vol. 1 as supplemented for specific touch and go training requirements, restrictions and approved airfields (without IP). A11.5.10.2.  Touch-and-go  landings  with  passengers  are  IAW  AFI  11-401  AFMC  Sup restrictions. A11.5.10.3.  Brief touch-and-go landing considerations with the other appropriate aircrew members prior to final approach.  On successive approaches, if the briefing remains the same and there are no questions, the briefing need not be repeated. A11.5.11.  Prohibited  maneuvers.    The  following  maneuvers,  in  addition  to  those  already specified  in  applicable  flight  manuals,  are  prohibited  unless  part  of  an  approved  test  plan, USAF TPS curriculum, FCF profile, or an actual emergency or system failure exists. A11.5.11.1.  Stalls. A11.5.11.2.  Initial Buffet. A11.5.11.3.  Dutch Roll. A11.5.11.4.  Emergency Descent. A11.5.11.5.  Simulated 3 engine, rudder power-off landings. A11.5.11.6.  Compound Emergencies  (except simulated engine-out with rudder power or EFAS off). A11.5.11.7.  Takeoffs and landings with the EFAS off. A11.5.11.8.  Actual practice engine shutdown. A11.5.12.  Operating  Limitations.    Unless  specifically  authorized  elsewhere  in  this  section, do  not  practice  emergency  procedures  that  degrade  aircraft  performance  or  flight  control capabilities (in-flight). A11.5.12.1.  In-flight,  prior  to  simulating  emergency  procedures  (EP),  the  pilot  will notify all crewmembers. A11.5.12.2.  In the event of an actual emergency, all student training and simulated EPs will be terminated. Training will resume only when the pilot in command has determined that no hazard to safe aircraft operations exist. A11.5.12.3.  Rudder power, series yaw damper (SYD) and EFAS will be on for all C/KC-135R/T  takeoffs.    Rudder  power,  SYD  and  EFAS  will  be  on  for  all  landings,  unless specifically directed by an applicable technical order procedure. A11.5.12.4.  Do  not  practice  traffic  pattern  operations,  instrument  approaches,  low approaches  or  go-around  at  gross  weights  that  will  not  afford  minimum  AFI  11-202V3 212 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 climb  gradients  three  engine,  flaps-30,  gear-up  (gear-down  for  emergency  procedures practice), and at approach speed for F-108 equipped aircraft. A11.5.13.  Landing Limitations.  The following landing limitations apply to both touch-and-go and full stop landings: A11.5.13.1.  Gross  weight.  Landing  gross  weights  will  be  at  a  gross  weight  that  will permit a safe, full stop landing in the runway available. At gross weights above 200,000 pounds pilot will brief and comply with flight manual sink rate limitations. A11.5.13.2.  Flap  Setting.  Do  not  practice  landings  with  less  than  30  degree  flaps.  Full stop  landings  should  normally  be  made  with  50  degree  flap  settings.    Consideration should  be  given  to  runway  length,  landing  distance  (including  flare  and  stopping distance),  crosswinds,  RCR,  and  other  factors  influencing  the  landing  ground  roll  in deciding to land with less than 50 degrees of flaps. A11.5.13.3.  Multiple  Full  Stop  Landings.    Compute  brake  energy  prior  to  each subsequent takeoff. A11.5.13.4.  Final  Landing Fuel.   Final landing fuel  will not be less than  5,900 pounds. Engineering analysis has proven that engine fuel starvation is imminent past this point. A11.5.14.  Zero-Degree Flap Approach.  Do not practice zero-degree flap approaches unless an  instructor  pilot  has  access  to  a  set  of  flight  controls  and  no  emergencies  (actual  or simulated) exist. The approach will be terminated no lower than 200 feet AGL. A11.5.15.  Practice Emergency or Abnormal Gear and Flap Operation.  Accomplish clear of clouds (not applicable when IP-supervised). May be accomplished day or night. A11.5.16.  Simulated  Instrument  Flight.    Artificial  vision  restricting  devices  are  not authorized  for  any  phase  of  flight  unless  as  part  of  an  approved  flight  test  plan.  Simulated instrument flight may be flown and logged without the use of a vision-restricting device.  AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 213 Attachment 12 C-146 OPERATING PROCEDURES A12.1.  General  Information  .    This  attachment,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing directives,  outlines  procedures  for  operation  of  the  C-146A  and  NC-146A  (Do-328  Test  Bed) aircraft under most circumstances.  AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of the C-146A/NC-146A/Do-328 aircraft must comply with the outlined requirements and consult AFMC/A3V for waivers to this attachment.  The NC-146A Test Bed aircraft follows the  same  guidance  as  the  C-146A  in  this  attachment  unless  otherwise  stated.    Operations  or procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished  if  they  enhance  safe,  effective mission accomplishment. A12.1.1.  Interfly.    Interfly  is  the  exchange  and/or  substitution  of  aircrew  members  and/or aircraft  between  MAJCOMs  to  accomplish  flying  missions.    Normally,  interfly  should  be limited to specific operations/tests, exercises, or special circumstances. A12.1.1.1.  645  AESG  maintains  current  Memorandums  of  Agreement  (MOA)  between AFMC, AFSOC, and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).  Unless otherwise specified in the MOA: A12.1.1.1.1.  If  a  test  or  test  support  mission  is  to  be  flown  then,  the  aircraft  will operate under AFMC flight orders. A12.1.1.1.2.  Crew  member(s)  will  follow  operational  procedures  of  the  MAJCOM that is signing the Flight Authorization. A12.2.  Mission Planning  . A12.2.1.  Aircrew Publication Requirements In Flight. A12.2.1.1.  C-146A.  The Aircrew Operating Handbook (Vol 1,2,3,4) are required to be issued  and  possessed  by  each  qualified  aircrew  member.    The  Quick  Reference Handbook, including normal and emergency checklists will be carried in flight. A12.2.1.2.  D-328  Test  Bed  Aircraft.    The  Aircraft  Flight  Manual  will  be  issued  and possessed by each qualified aircrew member. A12.2.1.3.  Electronic  Flight  Bag  (EFB).    Aircrew  members  may  utilize  EFBs  IAW  the most current version of the AFMC Concept Of Employment. A12.2.2.  Aircraft Weight and Balance.  The pilot-in-command is responsible for the proper loading, including load security, weight and weight distribution.  Weight and balance for the aircraft is accomplished in accordance with TO1-1B-50, Weight and Balance, and the AOH. A12.2.2.1.  Compute weight and balance by using the moments method or the approved spreadsheet supplied by the unit possessing the aircraft. A12.2.3.  NVGs.  All crewmembers will carry and preflight their own NVGs prior to flight for missions using NVGs. A12.2.4.  Fuel Planning. A12.2.4.1.  Plan to arrive in the terminal area at destination or alternate (if required) with: 214 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A12.2.4.1.1.  600 lbs. of fuel remaining during VFR A12.2.4.1.2.  900 lbs. of fuel remaining during IFR conditions. A12.2.4.1.3.  Land with no less than 450 pounds of fuel on board. A12.2.4.1.4.  Plan  to  consume  300  lbs.  of  fuel  for  each  instrument  approach  to  be flown. A12.2.4.2.  Minimum Fuel is 450 pounds and Emergency Fuel is 250 pounds.  Pilots will declare  “Minimum  Fuel”  or  “Emergency  Fuel”  to  ATC  when  fuel  quantity  reaches  the respective value and the aircraft has not been given an approach or landing clearance. A12.2.4.3.  Plan  an  additional  15  minutes  of  fuel  per  hour  at  a  maximum  cruise  power fuel  consumption  rate  for  that  portion  of  the  flight  where  structural  icing  or thunderstorms requiring off-course maneuvering are forecast or reported. A12.2.4.4.  For  missions  with  extended  periods  over  large  bodies  of  water  or  desolate land areas, if no suitable alternate exists between the ETP and final destination, pilots will include  an  additional  10%  of  enroute  fuel  to  their  total  fuel  requirements  for contingencies (ex., flight at aircraft depressurization altitude). A12.2.5.  TOLD.    Compute  TOLD  using  the  AOH  performance  data  charts,  approved tabulated data, or approved SDP/TOLD program.  Compute TOLD for initial takeoff prior to engine start.  Recompute data for pressure altitude changes of 500 feet, temperature changes of 5° C, or gross weight changes of 500 lbs. A12.2.5.1.  Options for calculating TOLD are in priority order: A12.2.5.1.1.  Option 1:  Use 1.2 Variable V2 (KVS) and a V1/VR of 1.0. A12.2.5.1.2.  Option  2:   If  the  runway  length  is  limiting  and  climb  gradient  is  not  a factor, use 1.13 KVS and V1/VR of 1.0. A12.2.5.1.3.  Option  3:    Use  TOLD  calculations  to  find  an  optimized  KVS  and V1/VR combination. A12.2.5.1.4.  Option  4:    Use  Short  Field  Operations  procedures  to  calculate  TOLD per A12.3.4. A12.2.6.  Aircrew  Uniforms.    Aircrews  will  wear  conservatively  styled  civilian  clothing when OCONUS and when required for mission or operational requirements and approved by the squadron CC or Director of Operations (DO). A12.2.6.1.  The  PIC  is  the  approval  authority  for  operations  with  degraded  equipment within  the  guidelines  of  the  aircraft  Minimum  Equipment  List  (MEL)  and  Minimum Equipment  Subsystems  List  (MESL).  Operating  outside  of  the  aircraft  MEL  or  MESL guidelines requires FOA approval.  This can be a verbal or email communication. A12.2.6.1.1.  Radar.    The  weather  radar  must  be  operative  for  flights  into  areas  of known or forecast thunderstorms. A12.2.6.1.2.  Icing.    The  NC-146A  will  not  operate  into  known  or  forecasted  icing with the sponsons and/or pods installed. A12.3.  Mission Guidance  . AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 215 A12.3.1.  Crew  Complement.  The  minimum  crew  complement  for  flight  operations  is  two pilots. A12.3.1.1.  Additional  Crew  Members.    Personnel  not  authorized  to  be  placed  on  the Aeronautical  orders  but  supporting  unit  missions  can  be  flown  in  MESP,  MEP,  or passenger  status  IAW  AFI  11-401,  AFMC  Sup.    Comply  with  applicable  directives governing  flights  with  these  personnel  IAW  this  instruction  and  the  AFMC  sup  to  AFI 11-202V3.  The  PIC  or  designated  representative  will  brief  all  MEPs  on  emergency procedures, egress, and appropriate FCIF items. A12.3.2.  Runway Requirements. A12.3.2.1.  Taxiway width.  Minimum width for all operations is 22 feet. A12.3.2.2.  Runway  width.    Minimum  width  for  normal  operations  is  35  feet.    Note:  Operations on runways or taxiways with widths less than the minimum turn radius of 47 ft. 6 inches require an additional level of risk management.  Runways narrower than the minimum turn radius will require the crew to accomplish star turns or other procedures to reposition the aircraft for departure.  Crews must also consider the distance from the nose gear to the main landing gear (24 ft. 4 inches) when attempting turnarounds. A12.3.3.  Normal Operations. A12.3.3.1.  Takeoff  and  Landing.    Minimum  runway  length  is  the  greater  of  Takeoff Distance or Accelerate-Stop Distance. A12.3.3.2.  Touch-and-Go  Operations.  A  touch-and-go  will  not  be  continued  unless sufficient  touch-and-go  distance  remains.    A  minimum  of  6,000  feet  of  runway  is required  for  Flaps  20  touch-and-go  landings.    A  minimum  of  7,000  feet  of  runway  is required  for  zero-flap  or  Flaps  32  touch-and-go  landings.  Touch-and-go  distance  is defined as Flaps 20 landing distance plus +10% of Flaps 20 landing distance + 1,000 feet prior to takeoff power application A12.3.3.2.1.  Wet  Runways.    Touch-and-go  operations  are  prohibited  when  the runway is wet and crosswinds exceed 15 kts. A12.3.3.2.2.  Icy  Runways.    Stop-and-go  or  touch-and-go  operations  are  prohibited on runways with an RCR of 4. A12.3.3.3.  Stop-and-go operations.  Available runway distance remaining after stopping the  aircraft  will  be  at  least  Takeoff  Distance  or  Accelerate-Stop  Distance,  whichever  is greater.  If the runway remaining is less, taxi the aircraft to achieve the required distance. A12.3.4.  Short Field Operations. A12.3.4.1.  Takeoff.  Minimum  runway  length  for  a  short  field  takeoff  is  the  greater distance of takeoff ground roll + 10% of takeoff ground roll, accelerate-stop distance at KVS 1.13-V1/VR 0.85, or 2,000 ft. A12.3.4.2.  Landing.    Minimum  runway  length  for  a  short  field  landing  is  the  greater distance of landing ground roll + 10% of landing ground roll or 2,000 ft. 216 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A12.3.5.  Semi-prepared  Surface  Operations.  Observe  guidance  contained  in  AFI  13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Procedures and C-146A Aircraft Operating Handbook (AOH ) for operations on unpaved or semi-prepared runways. A12.3.6.  NVG Operations. Due to the nature and limitations of NVG operations, increased ORM should be considered when using NVGs to enhance mission capabilities. A12.3.6.1.  Aircrews  may  land  at  an  LZ  marked  with  any  AMP  configuration  provided the pilots define identifiable touchdown and go-around points (e.g., visual point/location, timing past intended landing point, etc.) prior to landing. A12.3.6.2.  NVG go-around points will be briefed for all runways of intended landing. A12.3.7.  Reverse Taxi.  CAUTION: Using brakes to stop the aircraft while reverse taxiing may result in aircraft empennage contacting the ground. A12.3.7.1.  The  pilot  performing  reverse  taxi  operations  will  coordinate  reverse  taxi directions  and  signals  to  be  used  with  the  marshaller  prior  to  commencing  reverse  taxi operations. A12.3.7.2.  A loadmaster, third pilot,  or FTE will be in  a position to direct  reverse taxi, report  any  hazards  and  provide  the  pilot  with  timely  interphone  instructions  on  turns, distance remaining, condition of the maneuvering area, and stopping point.  WARNING: Ensure the aircraft is depressurized prior to opening the crew door. A12.3.7.3.  During night reverse taxi operations, the pilot will ensure visibility in the taxi area is sufficient to conduct safe taxi operations. A12.3.7.3.1.  Stop  no  less  than  25  feet  from  an  obstruction  even  if  using  a  wing walker. A12.3.7.4.  Secure  all  cargo  and  ensure  passengers  are  seated  prior  to  reverse  taxi operations. A12.3.8.  Operations Over Arresting Cables.  Do not roll over arresting cables at high speed during taxi, takeoff, or landing to preclude damage to bottom of aircraft. A12.3.8.1.  Do not taxi over raised arresting cables when the gravel guard is installed on the  nosewheel.  Raised  runway  barriers  are  elevated  above  the  runway  surface  using rubber "doughnuts". A12.3.9.  Enhanced  Field  Performance.    For  semi-prepared  operations,  the  TOLD  assumes that  maximum  takeoff  power  is  applied  within  three  seconds  of  brake  release.    The  semi-prepared  accelerate  check  time  also  assumes  this.    Based  on  this  guidance,  the  standard procedure  for  semi-prepared  operations  will  be  to  set  Flight  Idle  prior  to  brake  release, directing the PNF to set takeoff power within three seconds.  This technique has been proven to prevent propeller damage. A12.3.10.  Torque  Calls.    The  FTE,  when  positioned  in  the  loadmaster  jump  seat,  will provide torque call-outs starting at 70% TQ.  The FTE will call 70%, 80%, and 90% as the engine  with  the  higher  power  setting  reaches  those  limits.    The  pilots  will  slow  throttle movement  at  80%  and  cease  movement  at  90%  to  allow  engine  stabilization.    Once  the engine has stabilized, the power can be advanced to its final setting.  The FTE will announce an advisory “Torque” call over the interphone when the engine torque reaches either 100% or AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 217 the green torque markers, whichever is lower.  The PNF will verbally acknowledge the call. This procedure does not apply to enhanced field performance operations and aircraft installed with an engine torque aural advisory alert system. A12.4.  Instrument Procedures  .  No additional information required. A12.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions  . A12.5.1.  FDP.  The C-146A/Do-328 is considered a transport aircraft and will comply with FDP criteria outlined in AFI 11-202V3, AFMC Sup. A12.5.2.  Checklists.  In  the absence of a loadmaster, the FTE or third pilot  will ensure the cabin is secure prior to critical phases of flight and will respond to PNF checklist queries by stating “cabin secure” or “unsecure, followed by the reason.” A12.5.3.  Prohibited  Maneuvers.    The  following  maneuvers  or  procedures  are  prohibited  in the aircraft: A12.5.3.1.  Spins. A12.5.3.2.  Aerodynamic Stalls (past the pusher). A12.5.3.3.  Simulated runaway trim malfunctions. A12.5.3.4.  Bank exceeding 60 degrees. A12.5.4.  Confidence Maneuvers.  All confidence maneuvers will be accomplished in VMC conditions  with  a  discernible  horizon.    Ensure  the  airspace  around  the  aircraft  is  clear  of traffic by visually clearing the area prior to the maneuver.  Do not exceed AOH limitations unless operating under an approved test plan or waiver. A12.5.4.1.  Stall Series.  Begin stall series at least 5,000 feet AGL or 5,000 feet above the clouds if operating “VFR on top”.  For stall series training, recover from the stall at the first  definite  indication  (e.g.,  stick  shaker,  actual  stall  of  aircraft,  decay  of  control effectiveness,  or  pusher  if  required  by  a  test  plan).    An  IP  at  a  set  of  flight  controls  is required to perform this maneuver. A12.5.4.1.1.  Simulated or actual engine-out stalls are prohibited. A12.5.4.2.  Steep  Turns.    Accomplish  steep  turns  at  least  1,500  feet  AGL,  1,500  feet above the clouds if operating “VFR on top”.  Do not exceed 60 degrees of bank. A12.5.4.3.  Slow  Flight.    Do  not  fly  less  than  5  KIAS  below  VREF  for  aircraft configuration.    Do  not  exceed  15  degrees  of  bank.    Authorized  in  day  VMC  only  at  a minimum of 1,500 feet AGL or 1,500 feet above a clouds if operating “VFR on top”. A12.5.5.  Simulated Emergency Procedures. A12.5.5.1.  Practice simulated emergencies which require placing switches in other than their normal position or the aircraft in an abnormal configuration as specified in the AOH only during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner pilot  is  in  one  of  the  pilot  seats.    Preface  all  simulated  emergencies  with  the  word “simulated”  and  terminate  simulated  emergencies  if  an  actual  emergency  arises.    Note:  For training, 0 Flap approaches  and landings are  not  considered  emergency  procedures; 218 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 however,  if  an  actual  condition  exists  that  leads  to  a  flapless  landing,  run  appropriate emergency or abnormal checklists. A12.5.5.2.  IP candidates who occupy a pilot seat and are under the direct supervision of a  flight  examiner  pilot  not  in  the  seat,  may  practice  simulated  emergency  procedures during upgrade evaluations to IP. A12.5.5.3.  For  simulated  engine  out  operations,  retard  the  appropriate  throttle  to approximately 10% torque to simulate zero thrust on the simulated failed engine. A12.5.5.4.  Actual  Engine  Shutdown  and  Air  start.    If  required  by  a  formal  training syllabus test plan, or FCF, one engine may be shut down in day VMC only at a minimum of 5,000 feet above the ground or cloud deck, whichever is higher.  AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 219 Attachment 13 E-3/E-8/B707 OPERATING PROCEDURES A13.1.  General Information.  This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives, outlines  procedures  for  operation  of  the  E-3/E-8  aircraft  under  most  circumstances.    AFMC aircrews  and  all  management  levels  concerned  with  operation  of  all  E-3/E-8  aircraft  must comply with the outlined requirements and consult AFMC/A3V for waivers to this attachment.  Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment. A13.2.  Mission Planning. A13.2.1.  Melbourne  Intl,  (KMLB),    performance  data  may  be  calculated  using  RCR  16  in lieu of  RCR 10 per performance manual with a runway condition reported as "wet" without standing water.  Use actual MU or RCR if reported by ATC, for performance calculations. A13.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A13.3.1.  Crew  Complement.    Minimum  aircrew  complement  will  be  commensurate  with Flight Manual and /or mission specific requirements. A13.3.2.  Maneuver Restrictions. A13.3.2.1.  In-flight, prior to simulating emergency procedures (EP), the pilot will notify all crewmembers. A13.3.2.2.  In  the  event  of  an  actual  emergency,  all  student  training  and  simulated  EPs will  be  terminated.  Training  will  resume  only  when  the  pilot  in  command  (PIC)  has determined that no hazard to safe aircraft operations exist. A13.3.3.  Prohibited Maneuvers. A13.3.3.1.  This  section  adds  aircraft  limitations  and  restrictions  to  those  already specified in flight manuals and applies to all aircrew.  Unless on an approved test plan or an actual emergency exists, deviations from the aircraft flight manual are prohibited.  The following maneuvers are prohibited: A13.3.3.1.1.  Stalls A13.3.3.1.2.  Zero Flap Landings A13.3.3.1.3.  Dutch Roll (unless in approved lesson plan) A13.3.3.1.4.  Simulated Emergency Descent A13.3.3.1.5.  Simulated 3 engine, rudder power-off landings are prohibited A13.3.3.1.6.  Simulated Compound Emergencies. (Excludes 3-engine, 25 degree flaps landing). A13.3.3.1.7.  Actual practice engine shutdown (unless in approved lesson plan) A13.3.4.  Landing Limitations.  The following landing limitations apply to both touch-and-go and full stop landings: A13.3.4.1.  All pilots will plan to land on centerline within the touchdown zone. 220 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A13.3.4.2.  All  touchdowns  will  be  at  a  gross  weight  and  at  a  point  and  speed  that  will permit a safe, full stop landing in the remaining runway. If this is not possible, initiate a go-around. A13.3.5.  Engine  Running  Crew  Changes.    Unless  otherwise  published,  use  the  following procedures.    A  crewmember  should  be  positioned  at  the  point  of  entry  to  act  as  a  safety observer.   Crewmembers  should  approach  and  depart  the  aircraft  from  the  nose.  Crewmembers should ensure that all loose items are secure prior to entering and exiting the aircraft.  Pilot in Command (PIC) will ensure that the aircraft is clear prior to taxi. A13.3.6.  Air Refueling Limitations. A13.3.6.1.  Do not accomplish AR operations when: A13.3.6.1.1.  Conditions  are  encountered  which,  in  the  opinion  of  either  aircraft commander or the boom operator result in marginal control of either aircraft. A13.3.6.1.2.  Either the tanker or the receiver has less than the full number of engines operating. A13.3.6.1.3.  The tanker aircraft is unable to retract the landing gear. A13.3.6.2.  Tanker  Autopilot.  Conduct  AR  using  all  axes  of  the  tanker  autopilot  except when either the tanker or receiver requires training with the tanker autopilot off or when the tanker autopilot is inoperative. Tanker pilots must notify the receiver pilot when any axis  of  the  autopilot  is  not  being  used.    For  autopilot  off  tanker  must  have  normal disconnect capability, unless fuel emergency exists. A13.3.6.3.  AR  without  Tanker  Disconnect  Capability.  AR  without  tanker  disconnect capability  means  the  boom  operator  is  unable  to  get  an  immediate  disconnect  by triggering the disconnect switch. After a known loss of tanker disconnect capability with a  particular  receiver,  no  further  contacts  will  be  attempted  with  that  receiver.  The inability  to  get  an  immediate  disconnect  from  one  receiver  by  triggering  a  disconnect does not prohibit contact attempts with other receivers, if the tanker system (signal coil) checks good. However, if disconnects cannot be triggered on two successive receivers, no further contacts will be attempted unless required for the safe recovery of the aircraft. A13.3.6.4.  Practice Maneuvers. A13.3.6.4.1.  Restrictions.    Practice  emergency  separations  while  in  the  contact position  and  demonstration  of  boom  envelope  limits  are  prohibited  when  the  tanker has lost disconnect capability or during manual/emergency boom latching. A13.3.6.4.2.  Maneuvers initiated from the contact position require that the tanker AR system  be  in  normal,  and  a  disconnect  capability  with  the  receiver  must  have  been previously determined by a boom operator initiated disconnect A13.3.6.5.  Practice  Emergency  Separation.    Prior  to  the  actual  accomplishment  of  a practice emergency separation, coordination between the tanker pilot, boom operator, and the receiver pilot is mandatory. Coordination must include when the maneuver will occur and  who  will  give  the  command  of  execution.  Tanker  pilot  coordination  may  be accomplished over interphone with the boom operator. All crewmembers will be briefed on interphone prior to the practice emergency separation. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 221 A13.3.6.6.  Air  Refueling  Envelope  Limits  Demonstration.  Prior limits demonstration, a disconnect capability must have been previously determined by a boom operator initiated disconnect. to  a A13.3.6.7.  Receiver  AR  Training.    A  qualified  receiver  IP  will  conduct  training.  The receiver  pilot  must  inform  and  obtain  acknowledgment  from  the  tanker  pilot  and  boom operator when an unqualified receiver pilot is receiving AR training. During this time, a boom  operator  qualified  for  the  applicable  category  receiver  must  operate  the  boom controls, and if the tanker autopilot is off, the tanker must be flown by a pilot current and qualified in tanker AR. A13.3.7.  Formation Flying.  Formation is authorized IAW applicable technical order. A13.4.  Instrument Procedures. A13.4.1.  The E3/E8 is instrument category D. A13.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A13.5.1.  Simulated Loss of Engines. A13.5.1.1.  Perform  practice  or  simulated  loss  of  engines  IAW  this  instruction,  the applicable flight manual, and the following: A13.5.1.2.  Simulated  engine-out  approaches  may  end  in  a  missed  approach,  a  full-stop landing, or a touch-and-go landing using all engines during the takeoff phase. A planned three-engine  go-around  may  be  started  at  any  time  before  the  power  is  reduced  in  the flare.  If  no  IP  or  EP  is  onboard,  the  go-around  will  be  initiated  no  lower  than  200  feet AGL. Use all four engines as soon as safe and practical A13.5.1.3.  Simulated  two-engine  approaches  and  landings  will  be  practiced  under  IP supervision  only.    Simulated  two-engine  approaches  can  be  practiced  using  two symmetric  engines  or two-engine  procedures.  Two-engine approaches  and  landings  will  not  be  practiced  in  an  extensively  modified  aircraft. (Simulator only) three  engines  using A13.5.1.4.  Simulated engine-out, rudder-power-off approach and  go-around will not  be accomplished unless an IP has briefed the maneuver prior to flight and an IP has access to a  set  of  flight  controls.  The  go-around  will  be  started  no  lower  than  200  AGL.  For  an unplanned go-around, use all four engines as soon as safe and practical. (Simulator only) A13.5.2.  Practice  Emergency  Gear  and  Flap  Operation.    Accomplish  day  or  night,  clear  of clouds. A13.5.3.  Zero-Degree  Flap  Approach.    Do  not  practice  zero-degree  flap  approaches  unless an  instructor  pilot  has  access  to  a  set  of  flight  controls  and  no  emergencies  (actual  or simulated) exist. The approach will be terminated no lower than 200 feet AGL.  222 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 Attachment 14 F-15 OPERATING PROCEDURES A14.1.  General Information.  This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives, outlines procedures for operation of the F-15 aircraft under most circumstances.  AFMC aircrews and  all  management  levels  concerned  with  operation  of  all  F-15  aircraft  must  comply  with  the outlined requirements and consult AFMC/A3V for waivers to this attachment.  The notation, F-15,  is  used  to  describe  the  F-15A/B/C/D,  F-15E  and  F-15SA.    Operations  or  procedures  not specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished they  enhance  safe,  effective  mission accomplishment. if A14.2.  Mission Planning. A14.2.1.  Unit Developed Checklists.  Unit developed checklists may be used in lieu of flight manual  checklists  (except  -25  checklists)  provided  they  contain,  as  a  minimum,  all  items (verbatim and in order) listed in the applicable checklist. A14.2.2.  Low Altitude Map Preparation / Terrain Following (TF) Flight Map. A14.2.2.1.  On all low altitude flights, each aircraft in the flight will contain a minimum of one map of the low altitude route or training areas. The map will have current VVOD and  be  of  a  scale  and  quality  that  terrain  features,  hazards,  and  chart  annotations  are  of sufficient detail to allow navigation and safe mission accomplishment. A14.2.2.2.  Planned night TF turn point bank angles should reflect system limitations to ensure  maps  accurately  display  planned  routes.    Flight  leads  should  select  TF  letdown points that avoid initial descents into rugged or mountainous terrain at night (defined by TO 1F-15E-1 as any vertical change that exceeds 900 ft./NM). A14.2.3.  Briefing/Debriefing. A14.2.3.1.  Emphasize  low  altitude  flight  maneuvering,  obstacle  and  ground  avoidance, Low  Altitude  Warning  System  (LAWS)  features  and  limitations,  low  altitude  comfort level,  and  complacency  avoidance  on  all  low-level  mission  briefings.    For  low  altitude training over water and featureless terrain, include specific considerations with emphasis on minimum altitudes and spatial disorientation. A14.2.3.2.  Weapon  Systems  Officers  (WSOs)  should  brief  items  applicable  to  rear cockpit duties during the mission. A14.2.4.  Stowing  Equipment  in  Bay  5  (F-15A/C).    Stow  containers  or  baggage  with  hard sides  inside  a  Bay  5  cargo  container.    Without  a  cargo  container,  stow  only  soft-sided personal equipment baggage, such as hang-up or A-3 bags, in Bay 5.  Items stowed in Bay 5 will be positioned so as not to interfere with circuit breakers, test equipment, and ICS cables.  Items should be secured with non-stretchable cord in such a manner to prevent movement in all  three  axes  of  motion.    The  pilot  is  responsible  for  ensuring  items  stowed  in  Bay  5  are loaded  correctly  and  properly  secured.    The  carriage  restrictions  for  the  Bay  5  cargo container  are  identical  to  the  MXU-648/A  cargo  pod  except  for  the  airspeed  restriction, which does not apply.  Aircraft with items stowed in Bay 5 will not perform aerobatics but may execute tactical intercept missions restricted to LIMITED maneuvering.  Do not execute zero or negative G maneuvers unless safety of flight dictates. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 223 A14.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A14.3.1.  Ground Visual Signals.  When ground intercom is not used, use visual signals IAW AFI  11-218,  Aircraft  Operations  and  Movements  on  the  Ground  and  this  volume.    The following signals augment AFI 11-218. A14.3.1.1.  Jet Fuel Starter (JFS) Start: With clenched fist, pilot makes a pulling motion. A14.3.1.2.  Flight Controls Check: Raise arm, clench fist, and make a stirring motion. A14.3.1.3.  Brake Check: Hold left or right arm horizontal, open hand and push forward, breaking at the wrist (as in applying rudder pedal pressure with feet). A14.3.1.4.  Digital  Electronic  Engine  Control  (DEEC),  Improved  Digital  Electronic Engine  Control  (IDEEC)/Automatic  Thrust  Departure  Prevention  System  (ATDPS) Check:  With  the  fingers  and  thumb  of  each  hand  extended  and  joined  at  the  tips,  open and  close  the  fingers  and  thumbs  of  both  hands  simultaneously,  simulating  nozzle opening and closing. A14.3.1.5.  Target Pod Clear: Extend arm and rotate a closed fist in a circular motion. A14.3.2.  Taxi / Takeoff.  If the computed military power takeoff distance exceeds one-half of the available runway, takeoff using afterburner. A14.3.3.  Join-Up/Rejoin.    Flight  leaders  will  maintain  350  KCAS  until  join-up  is accomplished unless mission requirements necessitate a different airspeed. A14.3.4.  Tactical Formation. A14.3.4.1.  Wingmen/trail  elements  will  cross  above  the  lead/lead  element  when deconfliction is required during tactical maneuvering. A14.3.4.2.  Deconfliction  Responsibilities.    The  wingman  is  responsible  for  flight  path deconfliction  during  tactical  maneuvering  unless  he  calls  “Padlocked",  “Blind”,  or “Engaged” and flight lead acknowledges. A14.3.5.  Minimum Altitudes. A14.3.5.1.  Nose high, low speed recoveries and Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC) vertical maneuvers: 10,000 feet AGL. A14.3.5.2.  Aerobatics: 5,000 feet AGL. A14.3.6.  Radio Procedures. A14.3.6.1.  Any flight member may make a "Knock-It-Off" or "Terminate" call IAW AFI 11-214.  A KIO applies to any phase of flight and any type of mission. A14.3.7.  Air-to-Air Weapons Employment. A14.3.7.1.  Simulated  Gun  Employment.    Missions  may  be  flown  with  a  loaded  gun provided  the  gun  is  safe  IAW  TO  1F-15A/  E-34-1-1-CL-1  and  a  trigger  check  is performed prior to the first engagement.  Never perform a trigger check with a hot gun, regardless of Master Arm switch position. A14.3.7.2.  Maneuvering  Limitations.    Minimum  airspeed  during  low  altitude  offensive or defensive maneuvering (LOWAT) is 350 KCAS. 224 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A14.3.8.  Air-to-Surface Weapons Employment. A14.3.8.1.  Simulated Attacks against Off-Range or Manned Targets  May be conducted, to  include  use  of  Master  Arm,  A/G  Master  Mode  and  pickle  button  actuation,  when carrying practice ordnance under the following restrictions: A14.3.8.1.1.  No live or carted heavyweight inert A/G ordnance, or live A/A missiles are loaded. A14.3.8.1.2.  The  A/G  training  mode  is  used  on  the  Programmable  Armament Control Set (PACS). A14.3.8.1.3.  Stations  loaded  with  carted  practice  ordnance  are  not  selected  on  the training PACS. A14.3.8.1.4.  The combat laser may be used only in approved areas. A14.3.8.2.  Loft  Recovery  Procedures  in  Night  or  IMC  Conditions.    Escape  maneuvers following  loft  deliveries  are  instrument  recoveries  which  exceed  numerous  TF  limits.  Use the following procedures to manually recover to within TF limits: A14.3.8.2.1.  Recovery  Initiation  Altitude  (RIA)  is  the  sum  of  the  escape  corridor MSA and altitude lost during the dive recovery. Compute RIA for the planned escape corridor.  The  escape  corridor  is  defined  as  a  10NM  wide  corridor,  starting  at  the planned roll out point and extending for 8NM along the egress heading.  The MSA is 1,000  feet  above  the  highest  obstacle  within  the  corridor,  rounded  up  to  the  nearest 100 feet. A14.3.8.2.2.  Confirm  the  standby  attitude  indicator  is  reliable  prior  to  pull-up.  Display an Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI) in both cockpits throughout the loft maneuver and recovery. A14.3.8.2.3.  Following  release, roll to 120-135  degrees of bank  and  execute a 4-5g slicing turn.  As the nose passes the horizon, decrease bank angle to 90 degrees and continue  to  decrease  bank  angle  to  keep  the  nose  from  dropping  lower  than  10 degrees nose low.  Roll out on egress heading or upon reaching 10 degrees nose low and  follow  TF  steering  when  it  appears.    If  approaching  RIA  before  rolling  out,  or before TF steering appears, pull to recover at or above MSA. A14.3.8.2.4.  If  the  TF  system  fails  during  recovery,  maintain  the  appropriate minimum altitude (ESA/MSA) that provides terrain clearance. A14.3.8.2.5.  If  at  any  time  during  a  low  altitude,  nose-high  LANTIRN  weapons delivery (loft) or recovery, airspeed drops below 300 KCAS, abort the maneuver and recover.    Direct  primary  emphasis  towards  aircraft  attitude,  altitude  and  regaining airspeed. A14.3.8.3.  Pop-Up Attacks. Abort pop-up attacks if airspeed decreases below 350 KCAS (300 KCAS above 10,000 feet AGL). A14.3.9.  Low Altitude Procedures. A14.3.9.1.  Fly low-level formation positions/tactics using AFTTP 3-1vMDS, AFTTP 3-3vMDS as guides. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 225 A14.3.9.1.1.  Line abreast formation is authorized at or above 300 feet AGL.  When flying below 300 feet AGL, direct the wingman to a wedge formation position. A14.3.9.2.  Obstacles. A14.3.9.2.1.  If  unable  to  visually  acquire  or  ensure  lateral  separation  from  known obstacles that could be a factor to the flight, flight leads will direct a climb not later than 3 NM prior to ensure sufficient vertical separation.  Do not descend back into the low-level environment until visual with the obstacle or positional awareness dictates it is safe to do so. A14.3.9.2.2.  Low  Altitude  Warning  System  (LAWS)  equipped  aircraft.    During  all low altitude operations set the LAWS at 90 percent of the briefed minimum altitude or 90 percent of the command-directed minimum altitude, whichever is higher. A14.3.9.3.  Minimum  Airspeed.    The  minimum  airspeed  for  low-level  (less  than 1000’AGL) navigation is 300 KCAS. A14.3.9.4.  For  Air  to  Surface  range  operations  min  altitudes  will  be  determined  by Range restrictions, AFI 11-214 restrictions, or aircrew minimums, whichever is greater. A14.3.9.5.  Visual  Meteorological  Conditions  (VMC)  Route/Area  Abort  Procedures.  Comply with VFR altitude restrictions, maintain VMC and squawk applicable (IFF/SIF) modes and codes.  Attempt contact with controlling agency, if required. A14.3.9.6.  IMC  Route/Area  Abort  Procedures.    Immediately  climb  to,  or  above,  the briefed  ESA  and  maintain  preplanned  ground  track.    Execute  appropriate  lost  wingman procedures if necessary.  If deviations from normal route/area procedures are required, or if  the  ESA/MSA  is  higher  than  the  vertical  limits  of  the  route/area,  squawk  (IFF/SIF) emergency.  Attempt contact with the appropriate ATC agency for an Instrument Flight Rules  (IFR)  clearance.    If  required  to  fly  in  IMC  without  an  IFR  clearance,  cruise  at appropriate VFR altitudes until IFR clearance is received. A14.3.10.  General Terrain Following (TF) Operations. A14.3.10.1.  The minimum altitude for TF training will be the higher of MTR, MOA, or aircrew LASDT qualification, but not lower than 500’ AGL at night or in IMC. A14.3.10.2.  An operational  LANTIRN system is  required to  conduct  night  or day  IMC low-level operations below the MSA. A14.3.10.3.  For training, unarmed TF operations are prohibited. A14.3.10.4.  Minimum equipment required for TF operations is TF radar, radar altimeter (RALT), and E-SCOPE.  For IMC TF a functioning A/A and A/G radar is also required.  For night operations, a usable Navigation/Forward Looking Infrared (NAV/FLIR) HUD image is required.  NVGs may be used in place of the NAV/FLIR. A14.3.10.5.  Each  crew  will  confirm  by  inter-cockpit  communication  that  the  TF  and RALT are on and working properly before descending below the MSA. A14.3.10.6.  Any maneuvering that will put the aircraft outside of TF limits, negating fly-up protection, will be at or above the applicable MSA or ESA. 226 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A14.3.10.7.  Abnormal  Operation  during  IMC  TF.    Aircrews  who  experience  failure  of any portion of the TF system or A/A / A/G radar while flying IMC TF will immediately climb to (or above) the MSA (or ESA if not within 5NM of course).  If the failure(s) can be  cleared  and  safe  TF  regained,  TF  operations  may  resume.    Otherwise  terminate  the low-level portion of the mission. A14.3.11.  NVGs. A14.3.11.1.  Night BD checks are permitted only when wearing NVGs. A14.3.11.2.  Aircrew that are NVG Medium Altitude Qualified may fly below the MSA while  wearing  NVGs  during  low-level  navigation  if  using  the  TF  system  for  terrain avoidance.  With any failure of the TF system the aircrew will immediately climb to (or above) the MSA (or ESA if not within 5NM of course) A14.3.12.  Approaches and Landings. A14.3.12.1.  The desired touchdown point is 500-1000 feet past the runway threshold for a VFR pattern or 500-1000 feet past the Runway Point of Intercept (RPI) for a precision approach. A14.3.12.2.  Landing Restrictions: A14.3.12.2.1.  Do  not  land  over  any  raised  web  barrier  (e.g.  MA-1A,  61QS11),  or loose or slack cable (e.g. BAK-12/13/14). A14.4.  Instrument Procedures. A14.4.1.  The F-15 is Approach Category E. A14.4.2.  Area  Navigation.    The  F-15  INS  and  EGI  are  approved  for  Enroute  Area Navigation (RNAV); however, RNAV and GPS approaches are not authorized. A14.4.3.  Trail Departures. A14.4.3.1.  Each  aircraft/element  will  accelerate  in  MIL/AB  power  until  reaching  350 KCAS.  Climb at 350 KCAS until reaching cruise mach/TAS IAW Flight Manual, unless otherwise briefed. A14.4.3.2.  Upon reaching 350 KCAS, the flight  leader will set 850 FTIT for PW-100/-220 and 900 FTIT for PW-229 unless otherwise briefed. A14.4.4.  Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI) – F-15E.  In IMC the EADI must be used  as  the  primary  attitude  reference  by  the  crewmember  flying  the  aircraft.    The  F-15E HUD is not certified as a Primary Flight Reference (PFR) IAW AFI 11-217V1; therefore, it cannot be used as a sole attitude reference. A14.4.4.1.  The  HUD  is  the  primary  reference  for  low-level/TF  operations.    Do  not  use the HUD to recover from an unusual attitude or when executing lost wingman procedures except when no other reference is available. A14.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A14.5.1.  General.    Follow  the  procedures  in  this  chapter  when  other  than  normal circumstances occur.  These procedures do not supersede flight manual guidance. A14.5.2.  Aircraft Over-G Procedures. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 227 A14.5.2.1.  Non-OWS  equipped  aircraft  and  OWS  equipped  aircraft  whose  OWS  is  not operational  will  terminate  the  mission  and  land  as  soon  as  practical  from  a  straight-in approach. A14.5.2.2.  Aircraft equipped with an operable OWS system will immediately terminate maneuvering and call up the OWS matrix. A14.5.2.2.1.  If level "1" (one) is displayed in any column of the matrix except Mass Items (MIT), perform a battle damage check.  If no abnormalities are noted, the flight lead  may  continue  the  briefed  mission.    If  a  subsequent  level  "1"  or  greater  over-G occurs, terminate the mission, perform a battle damage check, RTB and fly a straight-in approach. A14.5.2.2.2.  If level "1" (one) or greater is displayed in the MIT column, or level "2" (two)  or  greater  is  displayed  in  any  column  of  the  matrix,  terminate  the  mission, perform a battle damage check, RTB and fly a straight-in approach. A14.5.2.2.3.  Document over-Gs (level 1 or greater) in the AFTO Form 781. A14.5.3.  In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures. A14.5.3.1.  A Simulated Emergency Procedure is defined as any procedure that produces an  effect  that  closely  parallels  an  actual  emergency,  such  as  retarding  the  throttle  to simulate the drag equivalent to a flamed out engine. A14.5.3.2.  Practice  aborted  takeoffs  only  in  the  flight  simulator,  Cockpit  Procedures Trainer (CPT), or a static aircraft. A14.5.3.3.  Simulated  in-flight  loss  of  both  engines  and  practice  in-flight  engine shutdown is  prohibited.   Exceptions:  Upgrading/qualified in  FCF or AHM, or part of a syllabus for a formal training course such as TPS. A14.5.3.4.  Emergency Landing Patterns.  Include the type of practice emergency pattern if appropriate in the gear down call.  228 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 Attachment 15 F-16 OPERATING PROCEDURES A15.1.  General Information.  This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives, outlines procedures for operation of the F-16 aircraft under most circumstances.  AFMC aircrews and  all  management  levels  concerned  with  operation  of  all  F-16  aircraft  must  comply  with  the outlined  requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this  attachment.    Operations  or procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished  if  they  enhance  safe,  effective mission accomplishment. A15.2.  Mission Planning. A15.2.1.  Takeoff and Landing Data. A15.2.1.1.  Compute a 2,000 foot acceleration check speed anytime the computed takeoff roll  exceeds  2,500  feet.    When  the  computed  takeoff  roll  is  2,500  feet  or  less,  use  the actual  takeoff  distance  versus  the  computed  takeoff  distance  to  evaluate  aircraft performance. A15.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A15.3.1.  General Requirements and Restrictions. A15.3.1.1.  (B/D model aircraft)  When the rear cockpit is occupied by other than a fully qualified F-16 pilot, the stick control switch will be placed in the FWD position. A15.3.1.2.  Baggage  or  equipment  will  not  be  carried  in  the  avionics  bay  behind  the cockpit or in the aft canopy fixed transparency area. A15.3.1.3.  Baggage  or  equipment  will  not  be  carried  in  an  unoccupied  F-16B/D  rear cockpit. A15.3.1.4.  Objects will not be placed in or on top of the engine intake. A15.3.1.5.  Publications, maps and personal items placed in the cockpit will be secured to avoid flight control and throttle interference. A15.3.1.6.  Pilots  will  ensure  the  ejection  seat  survival  kit  deployment  switch  is  in  the automatic position. A15.3.1.7.  The  CAT  III  position  of  the  Stores  Configuration  Switch  will  be  selected when  the  aircraft  is  configured  with  a  Category  III  loading  in  accordance  with  aircraft technical orders. A15.3.1.8.  Aircraft  will  not  descend  below  5,000  feet  AGL  during  any  portion  of aerobatic maneuvering. A15.3.1.9.  Flight  through  wingtip  vortices  and  jet  wash  should  be  avoided.  If unavoidable, the aircraft should be unloaded immediately to approximately 1 G. A15.3.1.10.  Unless conducting authorized High AOA training, do not attempt to bypass flight control limiters to improve performance.  Examples are: fuel transfer to alter center of gravity or use of the manual pitch override (MPO). AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 229 A15.3.1.11.  Unless conducting authorized High AOA training, the minimum airspeed for all maneuvering is based upon activation of the low speed warning tone.  When the low speed warning tone sounds, the pilot will take immediate action to correct the low speed condition. A15.3.1.12.  The minimum airspeed for low-level navigation is 300 KCAS.  If conditions allow,  enough  airspeed  and  altitude  should  be  maintained  to  allow  a  zoom  and  JFS-assisted airstart attempt in the event of engine failure. A15.3.1.13.  Use of Altimeters. A15.3.1.13.1.  General.  For those aircraft so equipped, the radar altimeter will be on for all flights.  The MSL Floor altitude advisory will be used for those missions that are conducive to spatial disorientation (night/IMC), or where minimum altitudes must be observed (ACBT floors). A15.3.1.13.2.  Non-TFR  Operations.    Set  the  ALOW  function  of  the  radar  altimeter no lower than the briefed minimum altitude. A15.3.1.14.  Afterburner  Use.    Do  not  use  AB  below  2,000  pounds  total  fuel  or established bingo fuel, whichever is higher, unless required for safety of flight. A15.3.2.  Ground/Taxi Operations. A15.3.2.1.  Ice FOD Procedures.  The following procedures apply when the conditions in the flight manual indicate engine damage due to icing is possible. A15.3.2.1.1.  The  first  aircraft  will  start  5  minutes  early  to  check  for  inlet  ice formation.  The pilot will brief the crew chief to look for ice build up on the inlet lip and strut  heater.  Shutdown immediately if icing  is  visually detected,  and  notify the SOF and the squadron supervision. A15.3.2.1.2.  Position ANTI ICE switch to ON prior to engine start. A15.3.2.1.3.  An  ice  FOD  monitor  must  be  available  to  monitor  the  engine  inlet  for ice  buildup  whenever  the  aircraft  is  stopped  for  an  extended  period  of  time  (i.e. ramp/shelter and EOR).  While taxiing, avoid unnecessary stops en-route to EOR.  If possible,  remain  at  the  ramp,  or  in  the  shelter  until  traffic  delays  are  eliminated.  Avoid  standing  water  and  snow  or  slush  accumulations.    When  pulling  into  the arming area, attempt to stop the aircraft over an area clear of water, ice, or snow. A15.3.2.1.4.  Hold in the arming spot with an ice FOD monitor present until cleared for take-off. A15.3.2.1.5.  Shutdown immediately if icing is visually detected and notify the SOF and  the  squadron  supervision.    Make  an  appropriate  entry  in  the  aircraft  forms.    A qualified  crew  chief  should  accomplish  an  intake  inspection  prior  to  restarting  the engine. A15.3.2.2.  Quick Check and Arming. Place hands in view of ground personnel while the quick  check  inspection,  arming,  or  de-arming  are  in  progress.  If  the  intercom  system  is not used during EOR checks, the pilot will establish and maintain visual contact with the maintenance team chief or weapons load chief to facilitate the use of visual signals. 230 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A15.3.2.3.  EPU  Check.    When  accomplishing  EPU  checks  at  EOR,  pilots  will  ensure that  maintenance  technicians  do  not  approach  the  aircraft  until  the  EPU  check  is complete.  Use a "thumbs up" signal or the intercom to indicate when it is safe. A15.3.2.4.  When  an  F-16  aircraft  is  used  to  certify  a  BAK-12  interconnected  with  a BAK-14  cable  retraction  system,  the  minimum  engagement  speed  will  be  75  knots  and the maximum engagement speed will be 90 knots.  As the F-16 engages a BAK-12/14 at a  speed  approaching  and/or  exceeding  100  knots  damage  to  the  underside  of  the  F-16 aircraft may result. A15.3.3.  Takeoff. A15.3.3.1.  Do  not  takeoff  if  the  computed  takeoff  roll  exceeds  80  percent  of  the available runway single ship or 70 percent for a formation takeoff. A15.3.3.2.  Make  an  afterburner  takeoff  anytime  the  computed  MIL  power  takeoff  roll exceeds 50 percent of the available runway. A15.3.3.3.  When  centerline  stores  are  carried,  start  the  takeoff  roll  beyond  a  raised approach  end  cable,  unless  runway  length,  runway  conditions  (wet/icy),  winds,  gross weight  or  cable  availability  dictate  otherwise.  Aircraft  configured  with  a  centerline  fuel tank  may  takeoff  across  approach  end  BAK-12  arrestment  cables  which  are  tied  down with an 8-point system. A15.3.3.4.  For single ship takeoffs, aircraft will steer toward the center of the runway. A15.3.3.5.  To takeoff in formation, aircraft must be within 2,500 pounds gross weight of each other and have the same type engine (PW-220 vs. PW-220, etc.). A15.3.4.  Overhead Traffic Patterns. A15.3.4.1.  Tactical  entry  to  the  overhead  traffic  pattern  is  permitted  if  the  following conditions are met: A15.3.4.1.1.  Published overhead pattern altitude and airspeed will be used. A15.3.4.1.2.  Specific  procedures  will  be  developed  locally  and  coordinated  with appropriate air traffic control agencies. A15.3.4.1.3.  Four  aircraft are the maximum  permitted.  Aircraft (or elements) more than 6,000 feet in trail will be considered a separate flight. A15.3.4.1.4.  Regardless of the formation flown, no aircraft should be offset from the runway in  the direction of the break.   The intent is  to  avoid  requiring a tighter than normal turn to arrive on normal downwind. A15.3.4.1.5.  Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing will be flown. A15.3.5.  Functional  Check  Flights  (FCF).  If  an  FCF  is  flown  for  engine-related  causes,  a maximum  afterburner  takeoff  will  be  performed  to  maximize  climb  capability  to  obtain  an immediate SFO high key position.  A ceiling, if present, must be confirmed to be at least 500 feet above computed high key altitude.  In all cases, departure-field weather must permit an immediate overhead SFO pattern where VMC can be maintained throughout the pattern. All engine-related FCF checks must be accomplished within gliding range of a suitable landing field  and  weather  must  permit  a  VMC  descent  to  high  key  and  VMC  SFO  at  that  airfield. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 231 Pilots  flying  engine-related  FCFs  will  verify  that  these  requirements  can  be  met  prior  to takeoff. A15.3.5.1.  If  the  ceiling  directly  over  the  departure  field  is  lower  than  500  above  the computed  high  key  altitude,  the  following  alternate  procedures  are  authorized.    A  pre-planned and coordinated position and altitude (alternate high key) that will allow for an immediate VMC  SFO will be determined prior to takeoff.  The weather  at  the alternate high  key  must  have  a  ceiling  no  lower  than  500  feet  above  the  computed  altitude required,  the  field  must  be  visible  from  this  position,  and  the  pilot  must  be  able  to maintain  VMC  throughout  the  SFO.    These  procedures  must  be  coordinated  and published  locally,  and  pilots  must  be  able  to  practice  SFOs  from  the  alternate  high  key position. A15.3.6.  Advanced  Handling  Characteristics.    Minimum  altitude  for  the  Horn  Awareness and Recovery Series (HARTS), Confidence Maneuvers, and Advanced Handling Maneuvers is  10,000  feet  AGL.    Reference  the  applicable  exercises  or  maneuvers  for  minimum  and recommended entry altitudes.  Procedures for these maneuvers are found in AFTPP 3-3.F-16.  HARTS maneuvers will be flown in CAT-1 configured aircraft only. A15.3.7.  NVG Lighting Restrictions.  The use of the “WING/TAIL – OFF” simultaneously with “COVERT-FORM” or “COVERT-ALL” is a prohibited external lighting configuration for NVG operations. A15.3.8.  Air-to-Air Operations. A15.3.8.1.  Maneuvering Limitations. A15.3.8.1.1.  Minimum  airspeed  during  offensive  or  defensive  maneuvering  below 5,000 ft. AGL is 350 KCAS. A15.3.8.1.2.  All CAT I configurations are authorized for unlimited maneuvering, as defined  by  AFI  11-214.    CAT  III  configured  aircraft  must  maintain  200  KCAS minimum during maneuvering. A15.3.8.1.3.  For  D-model  F-16s,  restrict  maximum-commanded  or  abrupt  control inputs below 150 KIAS.  Maneuvering may be resumed at or above 150 KIAS. A15.3.8.2.  Simulated Gun Employment. The gun is considered SAFE and simulated gun employment is authorized if the following conditions are met: A15.3.8.2.1.  Preflight. Procedures.   Accomplished IAW  DASH-34  Cold  Gun (SAFE) A15.3.8.2.2.  In-Flight.    A  trigger  check  must  be  performed  with  the  Master  Arm switch in SIMULATE and the aircraft pointed away from other aircraft and inhabited areas.  If  HUD symbology  reads "ARM" or SMS/MFD symbology reads "RDY," do not depress the trigger or continue with simulated weapons employment. Regardless of Master Arm switch position, do not perform a trigger check with a "hot" gun. A15.3.9.  Air-to-Surface. A15.3.9.1.  Off-Range  Attacks.  With  expendable  stores  (bombs,  external  fuel  tanks, TERs carted at the pylon, etc.) loaded on the aircraft, simulated weapons will be loaded (zero  quantity)  in  the  SMS/MFD  only  on  empty  or  uncarted/unexpendable  stations.  232 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 Exception: When loaded, captive Maverick and HARM missiles may be selected.  The Master Arm switch will be confirmed in OFF or SIMULATE prior to the first attack. A15.3.9.2.  Pop-Up Attacks. Abort pop-up attacks if airspeed decreases below 350 KCAS (300 KCAS above 10,000 feet AGL). A15.3.9.3.  Night Weapons Delivery/Range Operations. A15.3.9.3.1.  Compute a MSA for the entire bombing pattern. A15.3.9.3.2.  Do not  exceed 135 degrees of bank when returning to  the low altitude structure following practice or actual night weapons deliveries. A15.3.9.4.  LANTIRN Weapons Delivery/Range Operations. A15.3.9.4.1.  If CARA ALOW and/or MSL Floor altitude advisory warnings are used for altitude cues on medium altitude weapons deliveries, care must be taken to reset them as appropriate when descending into the low-level structure. A15.3.9.4.2.  The  LANTIRN  Attitude  Advisory  Function  (LAAF)  must  be operational  and  set  at  the  IP  to  TGT  run-in  MSA  plus  5,000  feet  for  all  night,  self-designated laser-guided bomb (LGB) Loft deliveries. A15.3.9.4.3.  The  pilot  will  perform  no  duties  (i.e.,  adjusting  designation  cursor  on targeting  pod)  other  than  maintaining  aircraft  control  from  the  initial  pull-up  during the performance of a night weapons delivery. During safe escape maneuver or during a  night  climbing  delivery  which  employs  a  descent  back  to  low  altitude,  pilots  will focus solely on aircraft control until the aircraft is recovered back within TFR limits and TFR indications are adequate to continue safe low altitude operations. A15.3.9.5.  Strafe  Procedures.    To  prevent  accidental  gun  firing,  pilots  will  not  select strafe mode until just prior to roll-in and will deselect strafe mode after establishing safe recovery parameters from each pass. A15.3.10.  LANTIRN Operations. A15.3.10.1.  Minimum  Altitude.    The  minimum  altitude  for  LANTIRN  training  will  be the  higher  of  VR/IR/MOA  minimum  altitude,  or  pilot  minimum  altitude  as  certified  by the unit commander. A15.3.10.2.  Vision Restriction Device (VRD) Restrictions: A15.3.10.2.1.  VRDs  will  only  be  worn  while  conducting  LANTIRN  low-level training and LANTIRN weapon deliveries. A15.3.10.2.2.  When  a  VRD  is  in  use,  a  safety  observer  must  be  present.    A  safety observer is defined as a crewmember qualified in that aircraft in the rear cockpit of a two-place aircraft or another aircraft flying in the chase position.  The chase aircraft must  maintain  continuous  visual  contact  and  have  two-way  radio  communication between aircraft. A15.3.10.2.3.  When  a  VRD  is  in  use  with  the  safety  observer  in  the  rear  cockpit, pilots are restricted to the same altitude and procedures they are cleared to for night LANTIRN operations. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 233 A15.3.10.3.  Operational Procedures.  All procedures in AFI 11-214 apply in addition to the following: A15.3.10.3.1.  Terrain  following  is  prohibited  after  any  alignment  other  than  a  full performance  INS  ground  alignment,  or  extended  interrupted  alignment  with  a flashing RDY/ALIGN (status 10 or better) displayed. A15.3.10.3.2.  TFR/LANTIRN systems will be in-flight checked using flight manual procedures on every flight involving TFR/LANTIRN operations. A15.3.10.3.3.  Pilots  must  ensure  all  LANTIRN  systems  are  functioning  properly prior to sustained low-level operations.  If any feature that is critical to overall system performance  -  Flight  Control  System  (FLCS),  INS,  Combined  Altitude  Radar Altimeter (CARA) - is questionable or disabled, the checks and/or LANTIRN portion of  the  mission  will  be  discontinued.    When  in  formation,  all  pilots  will  confirm  by radio  call  that  the  TFR  and  radar  altimeter  are  on  and  working  properly  before descending below the MSA; "(Call Sign), RALT ON, TFR ON." A15.3.10.3.4.  For TFR/LANTIRN operations, the ALOW feature of the CARA will be on and set no lower than 90 percent of the set clearance plane (SCP).  The CARA may be placed to standby or off only during air refueling operations.  Pilots need to ensure the CARA is tracking properly when descending through 4,500 feet AGL. A15.3.10.3.5.  Minimum airspeed for TFR navigation is 400 KCAS. A15.3.10.3.6.  During  descent,  pilots  will  accomplish  a  1,000  foot  Set  Clearance Plane (SCP) level off prior to selecting a lower SCP. A15.3.10.3.7.  Pilots will not conduct LANTIRN operations in IMC below the MSA, and must abide by FLIP weather minimums while on military training routes. A15.3.10.4.  Abnormal Operation: A15.3.10.4.1.  Pilots who experience failure of the terrain following system or failure of  the  LANTIRN  HUD/FLIR  imagery  system  while  flying  low-level  missions  will immediately climb to the MSA or above.  The mission may be continued at the MSA within  the  low-level  structure  provided  the  aircraft  position  is  known.    If  aircraft position  cannot  be  positively  determined,  pilots  will  terminate  that  portion  of  the mission and execute route abort procedures. A15.3.10.4.2.  If the TFR/LANTIRN system fails prior to route entry, pilots may still enter the route and continue the mission at the MSA, provided the above provisions are met. A15.3.10.4.3.  Pilots  will  honor  all  system  fly-ups  and  will  not  continue  low-level operations  below  the  MSA  without  TFR  protection.    The  following  procedures  will be used at the first indication of a fly-up (pilots need only accomplish sufficient steps of the  fly-up terminates/clears): terrain  clearance  or  until the  fly-up  procedure to  assure A15.3.10.4.4.  Allow the fly-up to develop.  CAUTION:  If an automatic fly-up is not initiated  by  the  system  and  aural  or  visual  pull-up  warnings  are  present,  pilots  will manually initiate a fly-up and comply with these procedures. 234 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A15.3.10.4.5.  Throttle - As required.  CAUTION:  Military Power may be required to maintain a safe airspeed.  Do not hesitate to use AB if required. A15.3.10.4.6.  When terrain clearance ensured, Paddle Switch - Depress and release.  CAUTION:  Holding  the  paddle  switch  depressed  inhibits  fly-up  commands  to  the FLCS. A15.3.10.5.  If the system does not reset: A15.3.10.5.1.  Climb  to  MSA.    CAUTION:    Using  climb  angles  greater  than  20 degrees  can  result  in  rapid  airspeed  bleed  off.    The  use  of  AB  and/or  steep  climb angles can result in spatial disorientation. A15.3.10.5.2.  Level off at or above MSA and refer to checklist (if required). A15.3.10.5.3.  If the malfunction can be reset, pilots may continue TFR operations. A15.3.11.  High AoA.  F-16 Flight Manual prohibited maneuvers of  "intentional departures, not recovering at activation of low-speed horn, rudder-assisted rolls, and expanded g-limits" are  allowed  for  test  and  safety  review  board  approved  flight  tests  and  when  used  during approved High-AOA training programs. A15.4.  Instrument Procedures. A15.4.1.  The F-16 is approach category E. A15.4.2.  The  F-16  INS/GPS  and  EGI  are  approved  for  enroute  Area  Navigation  (RNAV).  Neither RNAV nor GPS approaches are authorized. A15.4.3.  Use of the Heads Up Display (HUD). Regardless of Block or OFP, do not use the HUD to recover from an unusual attitude or while executing lost wingman procedures except when no other reference is available.  The HUD in F-16 Block 25/30/32 aircraft and Block 40/50  aircraft  with  Operational  Flight  Program  (OFP)  40T5/50T4  (TV  Code  117/115)  and later OFPs may be used as a primary flight reference in night/IMC conditions.  The HUD in all other F-16 Blocks and OFPs may be used as an additional instrument reference, but  not the sole reference, in night/IMC conditions. A15.4.4.  Spatial  Disorientation  (SD)  has  proven  to  be  a  leading  killer  of  F-16  pilots.  Although  SD  is  most  common  at  night  or  in  IMC,  it  can  and  has  happened  in  day  VMC.  Reference AFPAM11-417 for information on the causes of SD, how to avoid it, and how to mitigate its consequences. A15.4.4.1.  Enabling PARS is an acceptable recovery method from SD induced unusual attitudes,  reference  AFTTP  3-3.F16  for  recommended  throttle  techniques  during  PARS recoveries. A15.4.4.2.  Pilots  should  ensure  deconfliction  from  other  aircraft  (primarily  above  or below their position) prior to PARS activation. A15.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A15.5.1.  Takeoff Aborts.  If aborting above 120 KCAS, suspect hot brakes.  Taxi the aircraft to  the  designated  hot  brake  area  and  follow  hot  brake  procedures.    During  any  abort,  the tailhook  should  be  lowered  if  there  is  any  doubt  about  the  ability  to  stop  on  the  remaining runway. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 235 A15.5.2.  In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures. A15.5.2.1.  Aborted  Takeoff  Practice.    All  practice  and/or  training  related  to  aborted takeoffs  will  be  accomplished  in  the  flight  simulator,  Cockpit  Familiarization  Trainer (CFT) or (if trainer unavailable) a static aircraft. A15.5.2.2.  Practice in-flight engine shutdown is prohibited unless conducting authorized airstart training. A15.5.2.3.  SFO’s will not be performed to a touch and go or full stop landing if aircraft gross weight exceeds 23,000 lbs. (A/B model) or 25,000 lbs. (C/D model).  236 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 Attachment 16 F-22 OPERATING PROCEDURES A16.1.  General Information.  This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives, outlines procedures for operation of the F-22 aircraft under most circumstances.  AFMC aircrews and  all  management  levels  concerned  with  operation  of  all  F-22  aircraft  must  comply  with  the outlined  requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this  attachment.    Operations  or procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished  if  they  enhance  safe,  effective mission accomplishment. A16.2.  Mission Planning.  Nothing additional. A16.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A16.3.1.  General Requirements. A16.3.1.1.  Wear  of  the  upper  pressure  garment  is  required  when  flying  above  44,000 feet MSL. A16.3.2.  Ground/Taxi Operations. A16.3.2.1.  When  ground  intercom  is  not  used,  use  visual  signals  IAW  AFI  11-218, Aircraft  Operations  and  Movement  on  the  Ground,  and  this  instruction.    All  signals pertaining to  operation of aircraft systems  will originate with  the pilot.   The crew chief will repeat the given signals when it is safe to operate the system.  The pilot should not activate any system that could pose danger to the ground crew prior to receiving proper acknowledgment from ground personnel.  The following signals augment AFI 11-218: A16.3.2.1.1.  APU Start.  With clenched fist, make a pulling motion. A16.3.2.1.2.  Engine Start.  Hold up number of fingers corresponding to which engine is being started, and make circling motion. A16.3.2.1.3.  Flight Control Check.  Raise right arm, clench fist, and make a stirring motion. A16.3.2.1.4.  Refueling  Receptacle  Open  or  Close.    Display  hand  flat  on  top  of helmet with fingers extended.  To open, raise fingers to the vertical position and heel of hand remaining stationary.  To close, reverse signal. A16.3.2.1.5.  Weapons  Bay  Open  or  Close.    Display  hands  with  fingers  extended, palms up and edges of hands touching.  Move hands apart several times. A16.3.3.  Takeoff. A16.3.3.1.  Make an afterburner takeoff when configured with two external wing tanks or anytime  the  computed  MIL  power  takeoff  roll  exceeds  50  percent  of  the  available runway. A16.3.3.2.  Do not takeoff with an SES LOW ICAW. A16.3.3.3.  Formation takeoffs with inert internal munitions are permitted. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 237 A16.3.4.  Maneuvering  Parameters.  For  aerobatics,  remain  above  5,000  feet  AGL.    During nose  high/low  speed  and  Advanced  Handling  Characteristics  vertical  maneuvering,  ensure maneuvers are terminated to allow recovery above 5,000 feet AGL. A16.3.5.  Ops Checks. A16.3.5.1.  Accomplish  sufficient  ops  checks  to  ensure  safe  mission  accomplishment.  Ops  checks  are  required  during  climb  or  at  level  off  after  takeoff,  prior  to  each engagement, and following air refueling. A16.3.5.2.  Minimum  items  to  check  are  ICAWS,  total  fuel,  g-suit  connection,  oxygen system, cabin altitude, and HUD maximum G indicator. A16.3.5.3.  The query and response for ops checks will include total fuel amount as read on the Standby Flight Group.  If wingmen are within 500 lbs. of the flight lead, a “same” call may be used. A16.3.5.4.  When external tanks are feeding, add a “tanks feeding” call to the normal ops check reply.  Make a “tanks dry”  call once the external  tanks are confirmed dry.  Once the  “tanks  dry”  call  has  been  made,  no  further  reference  to  tanks  needs  to  be  made  on subsequent ops checks. A16.3.6.  Fuel  Requirements.  Do  not  use  AB  below  established  bingo  fuel,  unless  required for safety of flight. A16.3.7.  Battle Damage Checks. When circumstances permit, flight leads will direct a battle damage check after each mission prior to or during RTB.  Brief deconfliction responsibilities and position change procedures. A16.3.8.  Overhead  Traffic  Patterns.  Overhead  patterns  can  be  made  with  unexpended live/inert ordnance. A16.3.9.  Approaches and Landings. A16.3.9.1.  Formation landings with inert internal munitions are permitted. A16.3.10.  Night Procedures. A16.3.10.1.  Night Lighting. A16.3.10.1.1.  When  ground  personnel  are  working  under the POSN/ANTI-COLL  switch  will  be  placed  in  BRT  (position  lights  100  percent, steady, anti-collision light off). the  aircraft, A16.3.10.1.2.  The  landing  light  and  a  position  light  on  each  wingtip  must  be operational for flight.  If only two position lights are operating, one must be on top of the wing and one on the bottom. A16.3.10.1.3.  For  taxi  and  takeoff,  the  POSN/ANTI-COLL  switch  should  be  set  to FLASH.    In  jets  modified  with  reduced-intensity  anti-collision  lights,  the  ANTI-COLL/BRT setting may be used. A16.3.11.  Air-to-Air Weapons Employment A16.3.11.1.  Simulated Gun Employment.

This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives, outlines procedures for operation of the F-35 aircraft under most circumstances.  AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all F-35 series aircraft must comply with the outlined requirements and consult AFMC/A3V for waivers to this attachment.  Operations or procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished  if  they  enhance  safe,  effective mission accomplishment. A17.1.1.  The  notation,  F-35,  will  be  used  to  describe  all  F-35  variants  (F-35A/B/C)  unless specified. A17.1.2.  Aircraft Operating Limits (AOL).  Nothing in this AFI overrides any existing AOL that may be in  effect  and more restrictive.  AOLs, flight  clearances, and  Flight  Series  Data (FSD) restrictions supersede any item  outlined in  this attachment.  Due to concurrent  flight testing,  it  is  imperative  that  operators  know  all  applicable  limits  prior  to  flight  and  comply accordingly. A17.2.  Mission Planning. A17.2.1.  Maximum  Asymmetry.    Various  emergency  procedures  reference  aircraft  lateral asymmetric values despite having no real-time computation displayed in the cockpit.  During mission  planning,  pilots  will  identify  conditions  where  lateral  asymmetry  could  exceed 15,000 and 30,000 foot-pounds in the event those emergency procedures are required. A17.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A17.3.1.  Ground Visual Signals.  Visual signals IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, NAVAIR 00-80T-113, Aircraft Signals NATOPS Manual, and this attachment will be used when not utilizing the ground intercom. A17.3.1.1.  INTEGRATED  POWER  PACKAGE  (IPP)  START.  Move  forefinger  in  a circular motion. A17.3.1.2.  ENGINE START.  Same as IPP start but accomplished after IPP is running. A17.3.1.3.  FLIGHT  CONTROLS  CLEAR  or  VEHICLE  SYSTEMS  BUILT-IN  TEST (VS BIT). Raise arm, clench fist with thumb up, and make a stirring action. A17.3.1.4.  REFUELING RECEPTACLE OPEN or CLOSED (F-35A). Display hand flat on top of helmet with fingers extended. To open, raise fingers to the vertical position and heel of hand remaining stationary. To close, reverse signal. A17.3.1.5.  REFUELING  PROBE  OPEN  or  CLOSED  (F-35B/C).    Display  right  arm with a clenched fist.  To open, rotate the arm outward away from the chest to mimic the probe  extending.    To  close,  move  the  arm  from  the  extended  position  back  toward  the chest. A17.3.1.6.  WEAPONS BAY OPEN or CLOSE. For open, display hands with palms up and  fingertips  touching,  then  move  hands  apart.    For  close,  move  hands  together  with palms up until fingertips touch. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 241 A17.3.1.7.  TAIL HOOK DOWN or UP (F-35C).  Display right fist with thumb extended downward.  Move thumb downward suddenly to meet horizontal palm of left hand.  To open,  reverse  the  motion  (thumb  upward  suddenly  to  meet  the  horizontal  palm  of  left hand). A17.3.1.8.  BRAKE  CHECK.  Hold  left  or  right  arm  horizontal,  open  hand  and  push forward, breaking at the wrist (as in applying rudder pedal pressure with feet). A17.3.1.9.  LAUNCH  BAR  RAISE  or  LOWER  (F-35C).    Rest  the  right  elbow  in  left palm with right forearm horizontal.  To raise, bring right hand up to shoulder level.  To lower, bring right hand down to horizontal. A17.3.1.10.  WING  FOLD  or  SPREAD  (F-35C).    To  fold,  display  arms  straight  out  at sides, then swept forward and hugged around shoulders.  To spread, display arms hugged around shoulders, then swept straight out to the sides. A17.3.1.11.  LOSS OF BRAKES WHILE TAXIING (F-35A/C). Lower tail hook. A17.3.1.12.  MAINTENANCE  INTERFACE  PANEL  (MIP)  SWITCHES  in  SAFE  or FLIGHT.  For safe, display three raised fingers on the right hand and then rotate the hand to point the fingers downward.  For flight, display three fingers on the right hand pointed downward and then rotate the hand so that they point upward. A17.3.1.13.  GUN  ARMAMENT  CHECK.  Point  index  finger  forward  with  thumb upward simulating a pistol and shake head yes for arm or no for de-arm. A17.3.2.  Ice  FOD  Procedures.    Unless  otherwise  specified  in  AOLs,  the  following procedures will be followed when FSD indicates engine damage due to icing is possible: A17.3.2.1.  If  conditions  warrant,  the  Supervisor  of  Flying  (SOF)/Top  3  will  have  the first flight lead start 5 minutes early to check for inlet ice formation. A17.3.2.2.  An  ice  FOD  monitor  must  be  available  to  monitor  the  engine  inlets  for  ice buildup whenever the aircraft is stopped for an extended period of time (i.e. ramp/shelter and end of runway (EOR)). Avoid standing water and snow/slush accumulations. A17.3.2.3.  Hold  in  the  arming  spot  with  an  ice  FOD  monitor  present  until  cleared  for takeoff. A17.3.2.4.  Shutdown immediately if icing is visually detected and notify the SOF/Top 3. Make  an  appropriate  entry  in  the  portable  maintenance  aid  (PMA)  and  qualified personnel must accomplish an intake inspection prior to restarting the engine. A17.3.3.  Takeoff. A17.3.3.1.  Conduct a thorough TOLD review comparing military power and afterburner when  computed  takeoff  distance  exceeds  one-half  of  the  available  runway.    In  some instances,  particularly  during  reduced  RCRs,  afterburner  is  less  conservative  for  refusal speeds. A17.3.3.2.  Use  a  minimum  of  15  seconds  (20  seconds  for  afterburner)  takeoff  interval between aircraft due to high engine turbulence. A17.3.4.  Functional Check Flights (FCF).  If an FCF is flown for engine-related reasons, the ceiling,  if  present,  must  be  confirmed  to  be  at  least  500  feet  above  computed  high  key 242 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 altitude.  In  all  cases,  departure-field  weather  must  permit  an  immediate  overhead  PFO (precautionary flameout) pattern where VMC can be maintained throughout the pattern. All engine-related FCF checks must be accomplished within gliding range of a suitable landing field  and  weather  must  permit  a  VMC  descent  to  high  key  and  VMC  PFO  at  that  airfield. Pilots  flying  engine-related  FCFs  will  verify  that  these  requirements  can  be  met  prior  to takeoff. A17.3.4.1.  If  the  ceiling  directly  over  the  departure  field  is  lower  than  500  above  the computed  high  key  altitude,  the  following  alternate  procedures  are  authorized.  A  pre-planned and coordinated position and altitude (alternate high key) that will allow for an immediate  VMC  PFO  will  be  determined  prior  to  takeoff.  The  weather  at  the  alternate high key must have a ceiling no lower than 500 feet above the computed altitude. A17.3.5.  Rejoin.    Flight  leaders  will  maintain  300-350  knots  indicated  airspeed  (KCAS) until  join-up  is  accomplished  unless  mission  requirements  or  noise  abatement  procedures necessitate a different briefed speed. A17.3.6.  Radio  Procedures.    Comm  A  (alpha)  is  assumed.    Example:    “Jester  11  Push mission.”  All other comm (B, C, datalinks, etc) should be specified as required. A17.3.7.  Low Altitude Procedures. A17.3.7.1.  Fly  low-level  formation  positions  using  AFTTP  3-1.F-35  and  AFTTP(I)  3-3.F35 as guides. A17.3.7.2.  Minimum airspeed for low-level navigation is 300 KCAS. A17.3.7.3.  Minimum  airspeed  during  low  altitude  offensive  or  defensive  maneuvering (below 5,000 feet AGL) is 350 KCAS. A17.3.8.  Approaches and Landings. A17.3.8.1.  The  desired  touchdown  point  is  500-1000  feet  past  the  runway  threshold  or the Runway Point of Intercept for a precision approach. A17.3.8.2.  Do not land over any raised web barrier or loose or slack cable. A17.3.9.  Night Operations. A17.3.9.1.  Night Lighting Requirements. A17.3.9.1.1.  Position  lights.  Only  one  position  light  (POSIT)  on  each  wing  is required. However, if each wing only has one light, they must be on opposite sides; one upper, one lower (ex: top left, bottom right). Substituting a formation light in lieu of a wingtip position light is not permitted. A17.3.9.1.2.  Landing/Taxi Light. The landing/taxi light must be operational prior to takeoff. The taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be visually cleared without the landing/taxi light. A17.3.9.1.3.  Strobe  lights.  One  operational  strobe  light  (STROB)  is  required  for night  operations (ground and air). The strobe  lights  can be turned DIM or OFF if it causes  distraction  to  the  pilot.  If  the  strobe  lights  are  turned  off  while  outside operational airspace, then at least one aircraft within a standard formation must have AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 243 POSIT switch in the FLASH setting. Position lights in the FLASH setting meet AFI 11-202V3 requirements for anti-collision. A17.3.9.2.  Night Ground Operations. A17.3.9.2.1.  When ground personnel are working under or around the aircraft, select POSIT BRT STDY, STROB OFF (position lights 100%, steady, strobe lights off). A17.3.9.2.2.  For taxi and takeoff, set POSIT BRT FLASH, STROB BRT. A17.3.9.3.  Night Vision Devices (NVDs). A17.3.9.3.1.  Night  vision  in  the  F-35  is  unique  from  other  weapon  systems.    The pilot has two options, the Night Vision Camera (NVC) and the Distributed Aperture System (DAS), which are selectable by Hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) rather than  physically  secured  to  the  helmet.    They  are  reliant  on  different  wavelengths  of near-infrared  and  infrared  respectively.    These  systems  are  under  test  and  AFIs  that describe NVG/NVD usage should not be considered applicable to the F-35 systems. A17.3.9.3.2.  The NVC and DAS do not require donning or doffing.  However, pilots should plan their usage of these systems in order to minimize the potential of spatial disorientation and the detrimental effects to night vision during administrative phases of flight (e.g., approach to landing or aerial refueling). A17.4.  Instrument Procedures. A17.4.1.  The  F-35A/B  is  approach  Category  E.    Accomplish  missed  approach  IAW  FSD procedures.  Missed approach airspeed is 250 KCAS. A17.4.2.  The  F-35C  is  approach  Category  D.    Accomplish  missed  approach  IAW  FSD procedures.  Missed approach airspeed is 250 KCAS. A17.4.3.  Trail Departures A17.4.3.1.  Each  aircraft/element  will  accelerate  in  MIL/AB  power  until  reaching  350 KCAS.    Climb  at  350  KCAS  until  reaching  cruise  Mach/TAS  IAW  FSD,  unless otherwise briefed. A17.4.3.2.  Upon reaching 350 KCAS, the flight leader will set and maintain 90% ETR, unless otherwise briefed. A17.4.4.  The F-35 is not approved for RNAV/GPS approaches. A17.4.5.  Endorsed  Primary  Flight  Reference  (PFR).    Anytime  flight  conditions  or procedures require flight by reference to instruments, the pilot must select and continuously display an endorsed PFR.  For the F-35, these include the virtual Heads-Up Display (vHUD) or  the  Electronic  Flight  Instrument  (EFI).    Note  that  both  are  heads  down  displays.    The standby ADI and HMD are not endorsed PFRs. A17.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A17.5.1.  Air-to-Air Operations.  Follow guidance contained within 11-2F-35AV3. A17.5.2.  Air-to-Surface Operations.  Follow guidance contained within 11-2F-35AV3. A17.5.3.  In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures. 244 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A17.5.3.1.  Aborted takeoffs will only be practiced in the simulator. A17.5.3.2.  Flameouts  cannot  be  accurately  simulated  in  the  aircraft  and  will  only  be practiced  in  the  simulator.    These  training  events  are  logged  as  simulated  flameouts (SFO). A17.5.3.3.  Precautionary Flameouts (PFO) can be practiced in the aircraft or simulator. A17.5.3.3.1.  A  practice  PFO  will  be  terminated  if  the  aircraft  is  not  properly configured  with  the  appropriate  airspeed  and  in  a  position  to  safely  complete  the landing by 2,000 feet AGL. A17.5.3.3.2.  Touch-and-go landings from a practice PFO are authorized.  AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 245 Attachment 18 H-1 OPERATING PROCEDURES A18.1.  General Information.  This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives, outlines  procedures  for  operation  of  the  UH/TH-1  aircraft  under  most  circumstances.    AF  and contractor aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all UH/TH-1 aircraft must  comply  with  the  outlined  requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this attachment.    Operations  or  procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished  if  they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment. A18.1.1.  Reference  to  the  Air  Force  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  3-3.H-1  (AFTTP 3-3.H-1)  for  conducting  standard  H-1  operations  is  encouraged,  especially  during  upgrade training. A18.1.2.  Mission  Descriptions.    In  general,  the  mission  symbols  assigned  by  AFI  11-401, AFMC  Supplement  1  and  their  descriptions  define  an  “operational”  mission  versus “training.”  Direct test missions (O4 symbol) and test support missions (O5 symbol) resulting from an approved test plan/test directive are considered operational.  If the unit is supporting test  wing  customers  paying  for  helicopter  support  of  their  training  activities  (such  as paradrops  or  helocast),  conducting  Distinguished  Visitor  (DV)  support,  natural  disaster response,  search  and  rescue  operations,  or  actual  firefighting,  those  missions  are  also considered  “operational”  (O7  symbol).    If  the  main  objective  of  the  mission  is  helicopter crew continuation or upgrade training, those should be considered “training” (O6 symbol). A18.2.  Mission Planning. A18.2.1.  Weather Minimums. A18.2.1.1.  Ceiling and visibility requirements are in compliance with AFI 11-202V3 and applicable  supplements,  except  for  VFR  training  missions  which  require  1000  feet  /  3 miles visibility. A18.2.1.2.  Flight profiles consisting of only hover operations require a minimum of one mile visibility for both operational and training missions. A18.2.1.3.  Wind Limitations. A18.2.1.3.1.  Operational – IAW T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1 and T.O. 1H-1(T)H-1. A18.2.1.3.2.  Training – 40 knots peak wind or 20-knot gust spread. A18.2.2.  Minimum  Crew  Requirements.    Minimum  crew  requirements  are  established  by T.O.  1H-1(U)N-1  and  T.O.  1H-1(T)H-1.    In  addition  to  flight  manual  requirements,  Table A18.1  specifies  minimum  crew  requirements  for  missions  accomplished  within  AFMC.  Special  Missions  Aviators  add  significantly  to  the  safety  and  efficiency  of  all  helicopter missions  and  should  be  used  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.    On  single-pilot  missions, additional aircrew or passengers may sit in the left front seat when not required in the cargo compartment. 246 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 Table A18.1.

An instructor pilot must be designated on the flight orders and at a set of controls. 2.  Training flights accomplished as a part of an upgrade (to copilot, aircraft commander or instructor) will have a special missions aviator. 3.  Passengers will not be on the aircraft when practice emergency procedures are flown. 4.  Mission profile and passenger personal requirements must be carefully considered prior to flying single-pilot.  Cabin doors will be closed when flying single-pilot with passengers. 5.  Single-pilot landings at prepared sites and/or within a range complex are permitted provided a minimum of 300  feet rotor disk clearance is provided.  Landings may be made to areas that provide a minimum of  75 feet rotor disk clearance (from each blade tip) with a pilot and a co-pilot/SMA.  If landing to  areas that do not meet these requirements, minimum crew is a pilot, co-pilot, and special missions aviator. 6.  If the chase formation includes aircraft with a crew complement less than a pilot, copilot, and SMA, the minimum aircraft separation is 3 rotor diameters, based on the aircraft with the largest rotor diameter.   7.  Minimum separation will be no less than one rotor diameter, based on the aircraft with the largest diameter.   A18.2.3.  Weight and Balance. A18.2.3.1.  Weight  and  Balance  will  be  computed  IAW  T.O.  1H-1(U)N-1,  T.O.  1H- 1(T)H-1, T.O. 1H-1(U)N-5, T.O. 1H-1(T)H-5, and  T.O.1 -1B-50. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1 1 1 1 1  1 1    1    AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 247 A18.2.3.2.  Weight and Balance computations will be accomplished in handwritten form or  by  use  of  the  current  Automated  Weight  and  Balance  System  (AWBS).  When computing weight and balance, the “Transport” side of the Form F will be used. Weight and Balance is normally computed by the special missions aviator but can be computed by  any  qualified  crewmember.  The  original  Form  F  will  be  signed  by  the  crewmember that  completed  all  computations  and  by  the  aircraft  commander.  The  crewmember accomplishing  the  weight  and  balance  Form  F  will  make  a  copy  of  the  original  to  be carried on board the aircraft and the original Form F will be filed with the operations desk or, when off station, the base operations section prior to crew step. A18.2.4.  Takeoff  and  Landing  Data  (TOLD).    Whenever  possible,  TOLD  should  be completed  prior  to  the  aircrew  briefing  and  re-computed  in  flight  as  applicable  to  mission profile.  A  standardized  TOLD/Lineup  card  will  be  used,  as  determined  by  the  AFMC  H-1 Command  Chief  Pilot.    The  Mini-TOLD  card,  as  published  in  T.O.  1H-1(U)N-1,  can  be placed on the cockpit glare shield for quick-reference in flight.  Tab Data has been provided in T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1 to facilitate computing TOLD while in flight.  TOLD may be computed in flight using flight manual charts or Tab Data contained in T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1CL-1.  TH-1 TOLD will be annotated using the card in T.O. 1H-1(T)H-1. A18.2.5.  Non-standard Checklist Use.  Copies of the Before Takeoff, Before Landing, Hoist Operator’s Before Pickup, and Hoist Operator’s After Pickup checklists may be posted in the cabin and used by the aircrew at the discretion of the flight commander.  Accuracy of these extracts must be maintained and checked prior to each use. A18.2.6.  Passengers.    The  UH-1N  is  a  utility  aircraft  and  is  utilized  through  a  variety  of mission  sets,  including  passenger  transport.    DoD  4515.13-R  and  AFI  11-401  contain guidance  on  passenger  airlift  and  orientation  flights.    Units  must  ensure  compliance  with these  publications  for  passenger  transport  covered  by  their  provisions.    The  following guidance addresses passenger transport not covered by the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R and AFI  11-401,  which  allows  unit  commanders  to  use  aircraft  under  their  control  to  perform other official missions as required. A18.2.6.1.  Passengers  may  be  flown  on  H-1  aircraft  during  contingency  operations  of the  unit,  such  as  hurricane  relief  or  rescue  operations.    Comply  with  AFI  11-202 requirements for manifests. A18.2.6.2.  Military  personnel  not  on  aeronautical  orders  nor  approved  in  another capacity  such  as  MEP/MESP,  may  still  fly  aboard  the  H-1  when  supporting  activities such  as  special  forces  team  insertions/extractions,  SERE  instruction,  and  picking  up simulated survivors.  Comply with AFI 11-202 requirements for manifests. A18.3.  Altitude  Restrictions.  H-1  navigation  and  cruise  flight  below  2,000  feet  AGL  are considered  normal  operations  and  no  Low  Altitude  Step  Down  Training  (LASDT)  program  is required nor desired for operations between 300 and 2,000 feet AGL. A18.3.1.  Conduct all operations at or above 300 feet  AGL except when lower altitudes are required  for  takeoff,  departure,  arrival,  landing,  operational  missions,  training  flights  in approved areas, approved test missions, or when directed lower by a FAA/NACO Helicopter Route Chart. 248 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A18.3.2.  For  continuous  navigation  below  300  feet  a  low-level  program  or  detailed  test procedures  in  an  approved  test  plan  are  required  to  allow  H-1  cruise  flight  at  altitudes  less than 300 feet AHO but no lower than 50 feet AHO.  This restriction does not apply to remote operations, search operations, water bucket firefighting, controlled burn operations, takeoffs, landings, or when directed by ATC. A18.3.3.  Night  Vision  Goggle  (NVG)  Operations.  Use  of  NVGs  during  takeoffs,  landings, and hover operations is authorized.  The minimum enroute cruise altitude while flying with NVG’s is 300 feet. A18.3.4.  Unaided  Night  VMC  (cruise  flight).    Minimum  altitude  while  flying  unaided during night VMC is 500 feet above the highest obstacle, within five nautical miles of course centerline. A18.3.5.  Operational Searches.  Altitudes are determined by the aircraft commander and are dependent on terrain, aircraft limitations, crew limitations, weather, etc. A18.3.6.  Training  Searches.    Any  search  training  below  300’  must  be  in  a  surveyed  low-level  area.    Day  search  training  can  be  accomplished  down  to  a  minimum  altitude  of  100’ AHO. NVG search training can be accomplished to a minimum altitude of 300’ AGL / AWL. Night  unaided  search  training  can  be  accomplished  to  a  minimum  altitude  of  500’ AGL/AWL. A18.4.  Instrument Procedures. A18.4.1.  UH/TH-1  aircraft  are  flown  under  Approach  Category  A.  Prior  to  departing  from an  airfield  with  marginal  weather  conditions,  or  if  IMC  flight  is  expected,  the  aircraft commander will complete an instrument cockpit check and brief the appropriate instrument approach for emergency IFR return. A18.4.2.  Any crewmember seeing deviations greater than 10 degrees of heading, 10 knots of airspeed,  or  100  feet  of  altitude  will  inform  the  pilot  flying.  Deviations  from  prescribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be announced. A18.4.3.  Mandatory  altitude  calls  for  the  pilot  not  flying  /  special  missions  aviator  during non- precision approaches: A18.4.3.1.  “One hundred feet above minimum descent altitude” (MDA). A18.4.3.2.  “Minimums” at MDA. A18.4.3.3.  “Runway in sight.” Call when the runway environment is in sight. Do not call too  soon  when  obstructions  to  vision  (such  as  fog,  haze,  low  stratus  clouds,  etc.)  are present. A18.4.3.4.  “Go-around.” Call at missed approach point if the runway environment is not in sight. A18.4.4.  Mandatory  altitude  calls  for  the  pilot  not  flying  /  special  missions  aviator  during precision approaches: A18.4.4.1.  “One hundred feet above decision altitude.” A18.4.4.2.  “Land.”    Call  at  decision  altitude  if  the  runway  environment  is  in  sight  and the aircraft is in a position for a normal landing. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 249 A18.4.4.3.  “Go-around.”  Call  at  decision  altitude  if  the  runway  environment  is  not  in sight or if the aircraft is not in a position for a normal landing. A18.4.5.  Mandatory  calls  for  the  pilot  not  flying  /  special  missions  aviator  during  climb out/descent: A18.4.5.1.  “Five  hundred  feet  below/above  assigned  altitude”  and  “one  hundred  feet below/ above assigned altitude.” A18.4.5.2.  “Five  hundred  feet  above/below  initial  approach  fix  altitude  or  holding altitude”  and  “one  hundred  feet  above/below  initial  approach  fix  altitude  or  holding altitude.” A18.5.  General Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A18.5.1.  Survival Equipment and Restraint Devices. A18.5.1.1.  Overwater  flight.  Life  preserver  and  HEED  (Helicopter  Emergency  Egress Device or equivalent device) will be worn by aircrew and a life raft will be on board for over water flights when route of flight is beyond autorotational gliding distance of land. Ensure  sufficient  LPUs  are  available  for  all  passengers.    Life  rafts  are  not  required  if  a radio-equipped boat or a hoist-equipped helicopter provides mutual support coverage. A18.5.1.2.  Survival vests will be IAW AFI 11-301 and applicable supplements. A18.5.1.3.  Restraint  Devices.  Gunner’s  belts  (or  equivalent  harness)  are  authorized  for crew members when duties require them in lieu of a seat and lap belt. Only one gunner’s belt  may  be  attached  to  a  tie  down  ring  at  any  one  time.  If  seats  are  available,  aircrew members will be seated in a seat with a lap belt. Passengers involved in AIE operations and / or paradrop operations may be restrained by alternate methods, such as a 5,000 lb cargo strap or a personal restraint harness with locking steel carabineer (pigtail), provided multiple individuals are not secured to the same tie down ring. A18.5.2.  Preflight. A18.5.2.1.  Before applying power to the aircraft and / or operating aircraft systems, the AFTO  781  series  forms  will  be  reviewed  by  a  qualified  crewmember.  The  exceptional release (ER) must be signed prior to  flight  by an authorized maintenance representative or, in the absence of a maintenance representative, the aircraft commander. A18.5.2.2.  An  operable  white  light  (landing  or  searchlight)  is  required  for  all  night flights. A18.5.3.  Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. A18.5.3.1.  Crewmembers may accomplish refueling duties when maintenance personnel are  not  available.  Crewmembers  will  comply  with  T.O.  00-25-172.  When  not  directly involved in the refueling operation, personnel will remain a minimum of 50 feet from the aircraft.  Hot refueling (engines running) may be accomplished IAW T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1, T.O. 1H-1(T)H-1, T.O. 1H-1(T)H-1CL-1 and T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1CL-2. A18.5.3.2.  Engine-running  crew  changes  may  be  accomplished  under  the  following provisions:  one  pilot  will  have  seat  belt  and  shoulder  harness  fastened  during  pilot 250 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 change, the new aircraft commander will review aircraft forms, weight and balance and configuration, and current takeoff and landing data must be computed. A18.5.3.3.  Fire Guard.  A fire guard will be used for all engine starts. When maintenance personnel are not available, a crewmember may perform this duty. The primary duty is to assist  the  crew  in  evacuating  the  aircraft  should  a  fire  occur,  not  fight  the  fire  at  the engine compartment. A18.5.4.  En Route. A18.5.4.1.  Dual Engine Power Available Check.  Perform a dual engine power available check for: A18.5.4.1.1.  Operations  below  300  feet  AGL  (except  when  operating  on  routes depicted on published Federal Aviation Administration [FAA]/National Aeronautical Charting Office [NACO] Helicopter Route Charts). A18.5.4.1.2.  Non-Surveyed/Unprepared Landing Area/Remote Operations. A18.5.4.1.3.  Search Operations. A18.5.4.1.4.  Cargo Sling Operations (including Water Bucket). A18.5.4.1.5.  Hoist/Non-Hoist AIE (Ropes)/Water Operations. A18.5.4.1.6.  Controlled Burn Operations. A18.5.4.1.7.  Times  when  the  need  for  maximum  or  near-maximum  power  is anticipated. A18.5.4.2.  Perform  the  power  check  as  near  as  possible  to  the  same  Pressure  Altitude (PA) and Outside Air Temperature (OAT) as the operating area.  Slowly apply collective pitch without drooping Nr below 97 percent until computed power or a limit (as defined by the flight manual, section 5) is reached.  The engines must produce power equal to or greater  than  computed  from  the  power  available  charts  in  the  flight  manual.    If  the engines fail the power check or Nr droops below 97 percent prior to reaching computed power or a limit, terminate the sortie. A18.5.4.3.  Power  Requirements.  The  following  criteria  apply  when  planning  and  /  or accomplishing training missions. (Exception: due to the unique ability to instantaneously release the water or jettison the water bucket, the following restricted escape route power requirements  do  not  apply  to  water  bucket  operations.    The  crew  must  confirm  release and jettison capability prior to performing OGE hovers.) A18.5.4.3.1.  Clear escape route: power for intended hover +5%. A18.5.4.3.2.  Restricted escape route: Out of Ground Effect (OGE) hover power +5%. A18.5.4.4.  Forced  or  Precautionary  Landings.  Aircraft  commanders  must  consider  a precautionary  landing  as  an  option  when  mechanical  malfunctions  or  deteriorating weather  interfere  with  mission  accomplishment.  The  following  procedures  apply  to  all forced and precautionary landings: AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 251 A18.5.4.4.1.  Make  every  effort  to  notify  a  controlling  agency  (i.  e.,  declare  an emergency if  necessary  IAW  FLIP  guidance)  before  making  a  forced  or precautionary landing (time permitting). A18.5.4.4.2.  Every  effort  will  be  made  to  contact  the  unit  operations  supervisor (ground-to-ground/ground-to-air/ telephone) once the aircraft is safely on the ground. A18.5.4.4.3.  For precautionary landings due to deteriorating weather, the flight may be continued at the discretion of the aircraft commander. A18.5.4.4.4.  For actual,  impending, or potential malfunctions, corrective action will be completed before continuing flight and OG/CC approval must be received prior to continuing  flight.  If  contact  cannot  be  established  and  if  the  aircraft  commander determines it is  potentially more hazardous to  await maintenance assistance, he/  she may  continue  the  flight  to  the  nearest  suitable  area  if  the  aircraft  commander determines flight manual actions have corrected the malfunction. A18.6.  Transition  Maneuvers/Emergency  Procedure  Training  .    For  TH-1H  emergency procedure training, comply with requirements in AFI 11-2TH-1H, Volume 3.  Reference to the techniques provided in AFTTP 3-3.H-1for transition and emergency procedure training is highly encouraged. A18.6.1.  Emergency procedures will be conducted at an approved landing area under radio communications  with  the  appropriate  controlling  agency  (for  example,  tower,  runway supervisory  unit,  UNICOM,  etc.).  Aircraft  rescue  and  fire-fighting  equipment  will  be immediately  available.  All  practice  emergency  procedures  will  be  briefed  during  the  flight briefing. Crews will complete the transition/emergency procedure briefing in the UH-1N In-Flight Guide. A18.6.2.  Slide  Landing  Training  Areas.  Slide  landings  will  only  be  accomplished  to runways  or  suitable  taxiways,  with  ATC  approval.    Exercise  extreme  caution  on  barrier- equipped runways or when sliding on surfaces containing embedded lighting.  Slide landings may  also  be  accomplished  to  other  approved  surfaces  meeting  helicopter  runway  criteria specified in AFMAN 32-1123, Airfield and Heliport Planning.  Minimum dimensions will be IAW UFC 3-260-01, Airfield Facilities Design.  If wind information at the slide area cannot be obtained through tower or AWOS, a wind detection device must be present.  The aircraft commander will accomplish the following: A18.6.2.1.  Brief the hazards of the landing area prior to commencing any slide landings. A18.6.2.2.  Visually inspect the slide area for hazards and surface condition.  If the visual inspection was inconclusive, test the surface prior to commencing emergency procedures by accomplishing a slide landing with both throttles full open. A18.6.3.  Simulated Emergency Procedures. A18.6.3.1.  Prohibited  Training  Maneuvers.  The  following  maneuvers  will  not  be intentionally accomplished in the aircraft: A18.6.3.1.1.  Actual engine shutdown. A18.6.3.1.2.  Blade stall and power settling. A18.6.3.1.3.  Dual fuel control failures. 252 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A18.6.3.1.4.  Dual hydraulic system failures. A18.6.3.1.5.  Hovering autorotation. A18.6.3.2.  Training  Restrictions.    Unusual  attitude  training  and  emergency  procedures involving  engines  (to  include  simulated  autorotations),  engine  fuel  systems,  flight controls, or hydraulic systems will be accomplished only: A18.6.3.2.1.  During visual meteorological conditions. A18.6.3.2.2.  After official sunrise/prior to official sunset. A18.6.3.2.3.  When passengers are not on board. A18.6.3.2.4.  With an instructor pilot designated on the flight authorization. A18.6.3.3.  Single  Engine  Emergencies.  Simulated  single  engine  failure  will  be  entered no  lower  than  150  feet  AGL  and  55  KIAS  while  in-flight.  Single  engine  emergencies may be initiated from the ground or in a hover if single engine hover power is available. Single  engine  approaches  may  be  initiated  below  150  feet  AGL  as  long  as  simulated torque available is  limited with  both  throttles full open.  If a throttle is  reduced to  flight idle, ensure that combined torque is below single engine computed to prevent exceeding limits on the remaining engine. Single engine approaches and landings must be practiced to a slide or hard surface landing area. A18.6.3.4.  Boost  Off.  Minimum  entry  altitude  and  airspeed  is  500  feet  AGL  and  70 KIAS during straight and level flight, or on the ground. A18.6.3.5.  Manual  Fuel.  Minimum  entry  altitude  and  airspeed  is  500  feet  AGL  and  70 KIAS, in a hover if single engine hover capability is available, or on the ground. Before entering  into  manual  fuel,  ensure  that  the  collective  setting  is  below  single  engine computed  torque  available.  After  entering  into  manual  fuel,  maintain  torque  on  the manually governed engine approximately five to ten percent below the governed engine. During  high  density  altitude  conditions,  it  may  be  required  to  maintain  torque  on  the ungoverned engine less than five percent to preclude over temp, over speed, and/or over torque of the governed engine. A18.6.3.6.  Practice  Autorotations.  Due  to  the  risk  associated  with  this  maneuver, carefully  consider  wind,  density  altitude,  aircraft  gross  weight,  and  individual  pilot proficiency  prior  to  performing  autorotations.  The  IP  will  terminate  the  maneuver  and initiate  a  power  recovery  at  the  first  indication  of  abnormally  high  or  low  rotor  RPM, excessive  sink  rate,  low  airspeed,  ineffective  flare  or  at  any  time  an  inadvertent touchdown may occur. A18.6.3.6.1.  The initial  autorotation  will  be  a  straight-ahead  autorotation accomplished  by  the  instructor  to  evaluate  aircraft  performance.    On  evaluation flights,  the  instructor  (or  instructor  candidate)  receiving  the  evaluation  may accomplish this requirement. A18.6.3.6.2.  Practice  autorotations  will  be  accomplished  to  an  area  clear  of obstructions that permits a safe go-around. A18.6.3.6.3.  Practice autorotations require the aircraft landing direction to be aligned within 45 degrees of the wind direction when wind is 15 knots or greater. With winds AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 253 less  than  15  knots,  aircraft  landing  direction  must  be  within  90  degrees  of  wind direction. A18.6.3.6.4.  Minimum entry altitude is 800 feet above ground level (AGL) for 180-degree  turning  autorotations;  500  feet  AGL  for  all  others.  Practice  autorotations  in excess  of  180  degrees  must  terminate  with  a  power  recovery  at  or  above  500  feet AGL unless aligned on final for an approved training area within normal autorotation parameters. A18.6.3.6.5.  Simulated  instrument  autorotation  must  be  terminated  with  full  power recovery  no  lower  than  500  feet  AGL  unless  conducted  to  an  area  meeting  the requirements above. A18.7.  Flight Test and Mission Operations Procedures. A18.7.1.  Flight Test.  One of the primary tasks for H-1 aircraft in AFMC is to conduct flight tests  and  test  support  missions.    Some  examples  of  H-1  testing  include  use  as  a  target  for radar system upgrades, as a platform carrying seekers and sensors for munition development, as  a  chase  platform,  or  used  in  testing  H-1  modifications  and  upgrades.    The  test  planning and approval process establishes the procedures and limits for a particular effort. A18.7.1.1.  Flight Test Techniques (FTT).  When conducting helicopter performance and handling  quality  testing,  comply  with  U.S.  Naval  Test  Pilot  School  Flight  Test  Manual 106 (USNTPS FTM 106) and USNTPS FTM 107.  TPS graduates (or TPS students with an  IP)  may  practice  FTM  106  and  FTM  107  flight  test  techniques  at  a  set  of  flight controls on training flights.  Low airspeed control response, tethered hover, pace vehicle, and H-V diagram FTT practice may only be accomplished as spin-up for an approved test program.  Pace  vehicle  operations  may  be  unit  developed  but  approved  by  the  OG/CC during the test and safety review process. A18.7.1.2.  Chase Procedures.  H-1 crews will comply with the applicable procedures of paragraph 3.6.4. when flying chase missions. A18.7.1.3.  Qualitative  Evaluations.      Qualitative  evaluations  are  intended  to  allow  TPS graduates  and  TPS  students  to  experience  flying  a  completely  different  aircraft  and  be exposed  to  the  unique  handling  qualities,  flight  control  mechanical  characteristics,  and performance  capabilities  of  rotary-wing  aircraft.    TPS  graduate  and  student  pilots  and flight  test  engineers  may  participate  in  the  qualitative  evaluation  program.    The  aircraft commander  must  be  an  IP.    The  IP  may  demonstrate  practice  autorotations  to  a  power recovery if a UH-1 pilot/SMA is in the cabin to assist in monitoring aircraft performance.  Do  not  allow  unqualified  members  to  conduct  autorotations,  and  no  other  emergency procedures are to be demonstrated.  See paragraph 3.6.14. for more guidance. A18.7.1.4.  Modification Flight Manual.  Comply with the requirements for  Modification Flight Manuals (MFM) and Tailored Aircrew Checklists IAW AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program.  Aircrews should be familiar with the configurations contained in the MFM and all applicable limits and emergency procedures. A18.7.2.  Operational / Unprepared Landing Site Procedures.  This section provides guidance for  the  successful  accomplishment  of  operational  and  unprepared  landing  site  (remote) operations.    For  dedicated  training  missions  a  Helicopter  Landing  Zone  (HLZ)  survey  is 254 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 required  for  remote  operations  (see  paragraph  A18.8).    The  aircraft  commander  must consider crew qualification, aircraft power and capability, weather (including winds), terrain, environmental  factors,  illumination  and  mission  requirements  before  performing  any approach  to  these  landing  areas.    The  final  decision  to  accomplish  the  approach  or  landing rests with the aircraft commander. A18.7.2.1.  Landing  Area  Evaluations.    This  section  discusses  both  the  remote  site evaluation and the operational site evaluation (OSE). A18.7.2.1.1.  Remote  Site  Evaluation.    Areas  not  defined  as  operational  sites  are considered  unprepared  or  unfamiliar  landing  areas.    Operating  into  these  areas requires  a  remote  site  evaluation  which  consists  of  a  high  and  low  reconnaissance. The  full  site  evaluation  does  not  need  to  be  re-accomplished  during  successive approaches  to  the  same  area  where  conditions  are  equal  to  or  less  restrictive  than previous approaches. A18.7.2.1.1.1.  High  Reconnaissance.  The  high  reconnaissance  is  flown  at  a minimum of 300 feet above the site and a minimum airspeed of 50 KIAS. During this  reconnaissance,  in  addition  to  T.O.  1H-1(U)N-1  or  T.O.  1H-1(T)H-1 requirements, the crew will evaluate: A18.7.2.1.1.1.1.  Winds – direction, turbulence, and null areas. A18.7.2.1.1.1.2.  Elevation, pressure altitude. A18.7.2.1.1.1.3.  Temperature. A18.7.2.1.1.1.4.  Power available, power required, power margin. A18.7.2.1.1.1.5.  Approach and departure route. A18.7.2.1.1.1.6.  Size, slope, surface suitability. A18.7.2.1.1.1.7.  Touchdown point. A18.7.2.1.1.1.8.  Escape  route  (brown  out  /  white  out  heading  and  torque, abort Go/No-Go). A18.7.2.1.1.2.  Low  Reconnaissance.   Complete  a  power  check  prior  to conducting  the  low  reconnaissance.    The  low  reconnaissance  confirms  items noted  in  the  high  reconnaissance.    Pilots  may  descend  to  a  minimum  of  50  feet above the highest obstacle along the flight path and at a minimum of 50 knots to reconfirm items  noted on the high  reconnaissance.  The pilot  should  fly  the low reconnaissance  on  the  same  approach  angle  and  approach  route  as  discussed during the high reconnaissance.  If the selected approach route is not satisfactory, select  another  route  and  execute  another  low  reconnaissance.    The  low reconnaissance  may  be  accomplished  on  final  approach  if  OGE  hover  power  is available. A18.7.2.1.1.3.  Communication.  On  final  approach,  the  pilot  not  flying  /  special missions aviator will make advisory calls in 100 foot increments when above 300 feet  AGL  and  50  feet  increments  when  below  300  feet  AGL.  The  advisory  will include altitude and airspeed and, at the pilot’s discretion, descent rate and power applied (i.e.,”250 feet, 40 knots, sink 500 [fpm], torque 50”). After each advisory AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 255 call,  the  SMA/scanner(s)  will  provide  terrain/hazard  clearance  inputs.  Advisory calls  should  be  clear  and  concise  with  commentary  on  the  progress  of  the approach and hover operation. A18.7.2.1.1.4.  Landing.  When landing in an unfamiliar LZ, plan the approach to a hover to avoid landing on hidden obstacles. After landing, slowly reduce power until  surface  stability  is  verified.  This  procedure  will  facilitate  an  immediate departure  as  well  as  prevent  possible  tipping  and/or  aircraft  damage  due  to unstable surface. When landing to dry grassy areas, landing/searchlights should be turned off to prevent inadvertent ground fires. A18.7.2.1.1.5.  Obstacle  Clearance.  Whenever  rotor  clearance  is  25  feet  or  less, the scanner will inform  the pilot  of the clock position relative to  the nose of the aircraft and estimated distance to the obstacle. A18.7.2.2.  Operational  Site  Evaluation  (OSE).    The  pilot  will  review  the  site  diagram prior  to  accomplishing  an  Operational  Site  Evaluation  (OSE)  for  all  operational  site landings.  This review will highlight hazards and will assist the crew in determining the best approach/departure route. The pilot will review the site diagram prior to all landings and  takeoffs  at  the  site.    Evaluate  and  confirm  elevation,  power  requirements, obstructions, wind, and approach and departure routes before initiating final approach. A power  available  check  is  not  required  unless  the  aircraft  commander  believes  a  critical requirement exists. The purpose of the site evaluation is to alert the pilot to unforeseen, dangerous  situations  prior  to  being  committed  for  final  landing.    If  a  site  diagram  is unavailable or non-current, complete a remote site evaluation.  See paragraph A18.8.2. for information regarding operational site diagrams. A18.7.3.  Night Operations (Unaided). A18.7.3.1.  Unaided  night  approaches/landings  to  remote  sites  are  not  authorized.  Unaided  night  approaches  to  prepared  landing  areas,  such  as  a  lighted  helipad  or  an airfield, are authorized with sufficient lighting to see the landing area (landing light). Do not leave flight altitude until the location of the landing area has been identified. A18.7.3.2.  During night VFR descents, the pilot not flying / special missions aviator will call 1,000 feet above intended altitude, 500 feet  above intended altitude, 100 feet above intended  altitude,  and  intended  altitude.  On  final  approach,  the  pilot  not  flying  /  SMA will call rates of descent greater than 500 fpm. A18.7.4.  NVG Operations. A18.7.4.1.  The  searchlight  must  be  operable  and  equipped  with  an  IR  filter  for  flights conducted below 20 percent EMI (Equivalent Moon Illumination).  When EMI is below 20 percent, minimum enroute altitude is 300 feet AHO with an operable radar altimeter. If both radar altimeters are inoperative, minimum enroute altitude is 500 feet AHO. A18.7.4.2.  Comply  with  the  NVG  preflight  procedures  in  applicable  NVG  T.O.  (e.g., T.O.  12S10-2AVS9-2).    Do  not  fly  with  NVGs  that  fail  to  meet  the  visual  acuity requirements. 256 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A18.7.4.3.  Training will not be conducted with less than 5% EMI.  Adequacy of lighting on moonless nights will be evaluated by crew, taking into consideration cultural lighting and cloud cover. A18.7.5.  Medical Evacuation / Search and Rescue (SAR). A18.7.5.1.  Aeromedical  Evacuation  Missions.  Aircraft  will  not  be  used  for  routine patient  transfer. Medical  evacuation flights  may  be operated to  transport seriously ill  or injured  persons  and/or  to  transport  medical  personnel,  equipment,  or  supplies  under emergency conditions when other means are not suitable or readily available. A18.7.5.2.  Search  and  Rescue  (SAR).  SAR  missions  involving  life  threatening injuries/illnesses  will  not  launch  until  authorized  and  thorough  mission  planning  is complete.  Crews  will  attempt  to  coordinate  medical  support  if  time  and  circumstances permit. A18.7.6.  Ship Board Operations. A18.7.6.1.  General.    Aircrews  will  abide  by  the  provisions,  to  include  marshaling procedures, outlined in the following:  Joint Publication 3-04.1 Joint Tactics, Techniques, and  Procedures  for  Shipboard  Helicopter  Operations  (Electronically  or  updated  CD version)  and  AFI  11-218,  Aircraft  Operations  and  Movement  on  the  Ground.  Aircrew will conduct shipboard operations training IAW Navy/Army/Air Force Memorandum of Understanding.  Refer to AFI 11-2FT Volume 1 for all training requirements.  Reference to the techniques listed in AFTTP 3-3.H-1 is encouraged. A18.7.6.2.  Mission Commanders will ensure that all personnel receive a pre- deployment briefing consisting of the following: A18.7.6.2.1.  Launch Procedures and light/hand signals. A18.7.6.2.2.

Special procedures for night and IFR. A18.7.6.2.6.  Communication. A18.7.6.2.7.  Ship Resume. A18.7.7.  Paradrop Operations. A18.7.7.1.  Unit  commanders  may  authorize  parachutists  to  deploy  from  aircraft  under their  control.   Personnel  authorized  must  have  a  valid  operational  currency, administrative, or training requirement.  In addition, the personnel must be graduates of an accredited armed forces parachutist course and possess aeronautical parachutist orders.  The  AC  or  a  designated  representative  will  inform  the  jumpmaster  of  required qualifications.    It  is  the  jumpmaster’s  responsibility  to  ensure  all  participants  are  in compliance  with  these  requirements.    For  water  jumps  utilizing  SCUBA  equipment, personnel  must  be  certified  military  SCUBA  divers.    Comply  with  AFI  11-202 requirements for manifests. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 257 A18.7.7.2.  Drop  Procedures.    Refer  to  AFI  11-410,  Personnel  Parachute  Operations, AFI  11-301V1,  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  (AFE)  Program,  AFI  13-210,  Joint  Airdrop Inspection  Records,  Malfunction/Incidents,  Investigations,  and  Activity  Reporting,  11-402,  Aviation  and  Parachutist  Service,  Aeronautical  Rating  and  Aviation  Badges  ,  FM 31- 19 (US Army), and applicable T.O.s for all operations.  For static line jumps ensure the jumpmaster tapes the portions of doorframe, skids, and cabin that present a snagging hazard.  Reference to the techniques listed in AFTTP 3-3.H-1 is encouraged. A18.7.7.3.  Night  Paradrop.    Use  NVGs  when  conducting  night  paradrop  operations.  Tape  chem  sticks  to  each  end  of  the  personnel  restraint  device  (cargo  strap)  used  to secure the team personnel during cruise flight.  Ensure the DZ is clearly marked and can be seen under NVGs. A18.7.7.4.  Paradrop  Mission  Planning.    Conduct  a  face-to-face  briefing  with  the jumpmaster prior to beginning paradrops.  Each member jumping shall be given a safety briefing which will include normal  passenger type items  but  also  jump specific hazards such as avoiding the skids on exit.  Aircraft commanders should plan time for the team members to rehearse cabin movement and exit on a static aircraft. A18.7.8.  External Load Operations. A18.7.8.1.  External  load  operations  refers  to  equipment  transport  via  cargo  hook.  This includes  cargo  sling  and  water  bucket  operations.    Refer  to  the  UH-1N  In-Flight  Guide for preflight criteria. A18.7.8.2.  Crews will complete the applicable briefings outlined in the UH-1N In- Flight Guide prior to accomplishing the mission. A18.7.8.3.  Refer to T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1, T.O. 1H-1(T)H-1, AFJAM 11-223 Volumes 1-3, AFOSHSTD 91-46 for the cargo sling.  Reference to the techniques listed in AFTTP 3-3.H-1 is encouraged. A18.7.9.  Water Bucket Operations. A18.7.9.1.  General. Firefighting is one of the most hazardous missions performed by the UH-1N.    During  actual  fires,  the  entire  crew  must  exercise  extreme  caution  due  to  the rapidly changing conditions and multiple aircraft operating in and around the fire area.  If at  any  time  the  safety  of  the  crew  is  in  question,  aircraft  commanders  will  cease operations and clear the area.  Avoid over-flight of ground personnel, structures, vehicles, etc. to the maximum extent possible.  Reference to the techniques listed in AFTTP 3-3.H-1 is encouraged. A18.7.9.2.  Mission Preparation. A18.7.9.2.1.  Conduct  a  water  bucket  briefing  prior  to  all  water  bucket  operations. Crews will use the Tailored Aircrew Checklist from the MFM when conducting water bucket missions.  The ingress checklist will be accomplished per the guidance in the UH-1N In-Flight Guide.  Complete the egress checklist upon leaving the fire area. A18.7.9.2.2.  Water Bucket Terminology.  The water bucket itself is referred to as the “bucket,” and the water source is referred to as “water.”  If at any time the presence of the bucket constitutes a hazard, any crewmember may call “Pickle, Pickle, Pickle.” If  this  call  is  made,  the  pilot  will  jettison  the  entire  cargo  hook  load  (bucket,  water 258 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 release  hardware,  and  electrical  connections)  immediately,  without  discussion.  Normal  terminology  for  commanding  a  normal  water  release  is  “Dump,  Dump, Dump.” A18.7.9.3.  Drop Control. A18.7.9.3.1.  Airspeed and Direction. Drops made into the wind or at slower airspeed increase  the  concentration  of  the  drop  by  shortening  the  swath.    Drops  made downwind or at higher airspeeds will reduce concentration and increase swath length. A18.7.9.3.2.  Altitude.    Altitude  affects  concentration  in  swath  width;  the  lower  the drop,  the  narrower  the  swath  and  the  heavier  the  concentration.    Conversely,  the higher  the  drop,  the  more  time  the  water  mass  has  to  break  up  into  droplets  and  be dispersed  by  wind  drift,  therefore,  the  wider  the  swath  and  the  lighter  the concentration.    The  standard  drop  is  from  50-foot  AHO  bucket  height  and  50  knots indicated airspeed. A18.7.9.3.2.1.  Set  the  radar  altimeters  for  the  length  of  the  load  plus  10  feet. When  calling  altitudes,  special  missions  aviators  will  relay  bucket  height  above the ground and /or obstacles. A18.7.9.4.  Drop  Techniques.  Drops  on  structures,  equipment  or  personnel  should  be avoided unless specifically requested or there is an obvious threat to someone’s life. A18.7.9.4.1.  Hover  /  Spot  Drops.    Unless  a  stationary  hover  is  required  to  protect personnel/equipment, a slow forward hover at or above ETL is preferred at an altitude that  limits  the  downwash  (50  -  100  ft.  bucket  height).    Except  on  isolated  snags  or trees, hover/spot drops are not recommended on active ground fire, unless well inside a burned area, since the rotor downwash will intensify and spread far more fire than the drop will extinguish. A18.7.9.4.2.  Straight-Ahead Drop.  If attempting to concentrate the bulk of a drop on a  single  target,  a  low  airspeed,  high  altitude  drop  will  be  just  as  effective  while avoiding  adverse  consequences  of  the  rotor  downwash.    Fly  inbound  at  100  to  200 feet bucket height at 50-60 KIAS.  Upon reaching the target, the pilot will initiate a cyclic flare to allow the fire bucket to swing forward toward the fire. When the bucket reaches its apex, initiate the release by calling “Dump, Dump, Dump” and recover by rolling left/right, allowing the nose to fall to back to the horizon and regain airspeed. A18.7.9.4.3.  Turning Drop.  A sharp turn while releasing the water allows the pilot to hit a target without flying directly overhead and is particularly useful for steep terrain or thick smoke.  Approach the target area such that you can turn away from the main portion  of  the  fire  and  associated  smoke.    Altitude  should  be  100-300  feet  bucket height, at 60 - 70 KIAS.  The SMA or pilot flying will call a break turn, followed by the  “Dump,  Dump,  Dump”  command.    Initiate  the  release  as  the  bucket  swings  to apex toward the fire.  Turn into the wind once complete if conditions allow. A18.7.9.4.4.  Cross-slope  drops.  Cross-slope  drop,  whether  above  or  below  the  fire, usually present no special problems; however, watch the main rotor clearance on the uphill side in steep terrain. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 259 A18.7.9.4.5.  Down  slope  drops.  Down  slope  drops  low  on  the  slope  may  be approached cross-slope at a reduced airspeed with a 90-degree descending turn to the target.  This  allows the pilot  flying to  see the target  if turning in  the direction of the side they are sitting on. Another less recommended method is to come directly over the ridge for the drop. This type of drop requires careful planning, especially in steep terrain. The pilot must pick out objects on top of the ridge above the fire and in the background beyond the fire to line up on, as the down slope drop presents a blind run. This means that the pilot cannot see the target until crossing the ridge above the fire and only if not obscured by smoke. If the slope is very steep it may be advisable to approach  the  ridge  top  at  a  reduced  airspeed,  using  caution  not  to  get  too  slow  if downwind or too low when on the leeward side.  Slowing prior to the “dive” reduces the chance of  excessive  airspeed.  The pullout  must be planned to  provide adequate terrain  clearance in the event the drop is  aborted for any reason.  Down slope drops may be made at a slower airspeed and are more effective if made into the wind. A18.7.10.  Day Water Operations (Helocast, Hoist, Rope Ladder).  If working in water areas that  provide  less  than  300-foot  rotor  clearance  around  the  aircraft,  conduct  a  remote  site evaluation prior to commencing the water operations.  Areas providing greater than 300-foot rotor clearance do not require a remote site evaluation. A18.7.10.1.  Conduct  all  water  operations  training  a  minimum  of  50  yards  offshore  in approved  water  training  areas.    Reference  to  the  techniques  listed  in  AFTTP  3-3.H-1  is encouraged. A18.7.10.2.  Both radar altimeters must be operable for all water operations. A18.7.10.3.  Observation pass. If an observation pass is required, after the initial sighting of the survivor, maneuver to a position approximately 100 feet downwind of the survivor from  which  an  observation  pass  can  be  accomplished.  Pattern  direction  (either  left  or right patterns) is at the discretion of the pilot. If swimmer deployment is anticipated, the observation  pass  will  be  made  at  a  maximum  of  ten-feet  AWL  and  ten  knots  with  a heading from zero to 90 degrees off the wind line to allow for swimmer deployment.   If swimmer  deployment  is  not  required,  make  the  observation  pass  above  ETL  at  a minimum of 25 feet AWL.  After the observation pass, initiate a climbing turn at 50 feet AWL  to  a  100  feet  AWL  minimum  downwind  altitude.    If  OGE  hover  power  is  not available,  a  minimum  of  50  KIAS  and  50  feet  AWL  is  required  prior  to  initiating  the climbing  turn  to  downwind.    If  OGE  hover  power  is  available,  start  the  turn  at  a minimum of translation lift airspeed and 50 feet AWL. A18.7.10.4.  Approach  to  Hover.    On  final,  consider  descending  to  100  feet  prior  to initiating the slowdown. The pilot flying will make the “ONE MINUTE” call to the crew.  Generally, use a normal approach profile to arrive at 30 KGS and 100 feet altitude at 0.3 NM from the intended deployment/recovery point.  Once this point is reached, the power and  attitude  adjustments  required  to  initiate  a  200  to  300  feet-per-minute  descent  and continued  deceleration  to  less  than  10  KGS  are  critical.    If  the  aircraft  is  in  a  level deceleration  at  approximately  9  to  10  degrees  nose  up,  lowering  the  nose  to approximately 6 degrees nose up and increasing torque by 5 to 10 percent will generally result in a controlled, decelerative descent. 260 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A18.7.10.4.1.  Do not descend below 50 feet AWL until  established on final.  If the survivor is  not  ready  for immediate pickup, situation permitting, establish a holding hover  approximately  75  feet  downwind  of  the  survivor.    On  final,  descend  to  hover altitude and slow to approximately five knots forward hover speed 75 feet downwind from  the  survivor.    If  the  helicopter  instrument  panel  interferes  with  forward visibility, the final approach may be displaced to the side. A18.7.10.4.2.  During  helocast  operations,  a  rapid  cross-check  is  critical  to  identify and correct  negative trends.  The cross-check should  include altitude, ground speed, drift,  and  heading.    The  pilot  not  flying  (PNF)  will  continue  to  make  ground  speed and altitude calls throughout the deployment.  With good meteorological conditions, most of these critical helocast flight parameters can be determined through reference to  the  outside.    Once  in  helocast  parameters  (maximum  10  KGS,  10  feet),  radar altitude,  drift,  and  ground  speed  should  be  the  primary  cross-check  with  occasional reference to heading. A18.7.10.4.3.  Altitude control is also critical during helocast operations.  Injuries to deploying  personnel  are  more  likely  with  excessive  altitude  than  with  excessive speed.  Additionally, excessive altitude may result in equipment difficulties once the deployment low  as  conditions  permit  for equipment/personnel delivery. is  complete.  Generally,  get  as A18.7.11.  Alternate Insertion/Extraction Operations. A18.7.11.1.  Alternate  Insertion/Extraction  (AIE)  is  the  insertion  or  extraction  of  any personnel by means other than landing the aircraft (or paradrop).  Hoist, rope ladder, and swimmer deployment via helocast are examples of AIE operations. A18.7.11.2.  Equipment.  The special missions aviator will accomplish preflight and post-flight  inspections  of  all  AIE  equipment  used  in  flight.  Preflight/post-flight  will  be accomplished IAW T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1, T.O. 1H-1(T)H-1, and the UH-1N In-Flight Guide. The special missions aviator will also accomplish all required cleaning of AIE equipment which is outlined in the cleaning criteria checklist located with the AIE equipment. A18.7.11.2.1.  During all live land AIE training, personnel being inserted / extracted will  wear  eye  protection,  any  uniform  that  completely  covers  the  arms  and  legs,  a helmet, and either leather or flight  gloves.  During water AIE training the personnel being  inserted/extracted  may  wear  swim  mask/goggles  in  lieu  of  a  helmet/eye protection,  as  well  as  appropriate  swim  gear  as  determined  by  the  team  leader/cast master (snorkel/fins/shorts/gloves). A18.7.11.2.2.  All hoist-equipped aircraft will have precision wire rope cutters readily available in the event the electrical cable cut guillotine fails.  Affix cable cutters to the aircraft or hoist for quick access. A18.7.11.2.3.  Quick Splice.  A hoist cable quick splice device will be carried on all hoist-equipped aircraft. A18.7.11.3.  Hoist Operations.   (Reference to the techniques listed in AFTTP 3-3.H-1 is encouraged.) AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 261 A18.7.11.3.1.  Limitations.  Restrict  live  hoist  training  to  the  minimum  necessary  to accomplish  initial  qualification,  re-qualification  and  support  training.    The  unit CC/DO will determine eligibility of personnel to ride the hoist during training. A18.7.11.3.2.  Land Hoist.  Recommended “live” hoist altitude is 10 feet, but will be no greater than 25 feet for training. A18.7.11.3.3.  Water  Hoist  Altitude.  Recommended  hoist  altitude  over  water  or vessels  is  the  minimum  altitude  necessary  to  avoid  salt  spray  (30  feet)  and/or shipboard obstacles.  Do not conduct live hoist training over water or ships if required hover altitude exceeds 50 feet. A18.7.11.3.4.  Water  Hoist  Recoveries.    Install  the  flotation  collar  prior  to  lowering the forest penetrator. It is recommended to place at least one seat paddle in the down position  and  remove  one  safety  strap  from  the  stowed  position.    Do  not  unhook  the safety strap fastener from the penetrator. A18.7.11.3.5.  Grounding.    Ground  the  hoist  hook  to  discharge  static  electricity  to prevent  personnel  on  the  ground  or  water  from  sustaining  a  shock.    To  preclude ignition of fuel, do not ground the hoist near damaged aircraft or vehicles. A18.7.11.3.6.  Hoist  Rescue  Devices.    USAF  approved  rescue  devices  will  be  used and  include  the  forest  penetrator,  rescue  basket,  stokes  litter,  hook  and  survivor’s sling/strop.  A  survivor  unfamiliar  with  the  rescue  device  will  be  assisted  by  a crewmember  to  ensure  proper  entry  and  security  for  a  safe  pickup.    The  aircrew determines which device is most appropriate for each scenario. A18.7.11.4.  Rope Ladder, Fast Rope, and Rappel Operations.  Refer to AFTTP 3-3.H-1 procedures  for  rope  AIE  operations.    Rope  ladder  operations  may  be  done  over  land  or during day water operations. A18.8.  Helicopter Landing Zones (HLZ) and Operational Site Diagrams  .  HLZ surveys are required  for  all  dedicated  training  missions  and  recommended  as  part  of  the  normal  mission planning  for  supporting  customers  like  special  forces  who  may  use  HLZ  repeatedly.    HLZ surveys are not  required if another survey is  available (i.e. fixed-wing DZ/LZ survey or FARP survey).    Approved  operational  sites  are  not  considered  HLZs.    For  operational  missions  (as defined in paragraph A18.1.1) HLZ surveys are not required. A18.8.1.  HLZ  Surveys.    When  creating  HLZ  site  diagrams  for  remote  operations  training use the following guidance in lieu of AFI 13-217. A18.8.1.1.  HLZ  Selection.    HLZs  are  dependent  on  the  aircraft  type,  weight  and  size, and whether the HLZ will be used for takeoffs/landings or alternate insertion/extraction (AIE) operations.  Selecting the HLZ location is the joint responsibility of the SQ/CC and the supported force commander. A18.8.1.2.  HLZ Survey Requirements.  The HLZ survey program is an SQ/DO function.  The SQ/DO must ensure surveys are conducted IAW the procedures below. A18.8.1.2.1.  Completing  the  HLZ  survey  process  involves  a  physical  inspection  of the  HLZ,  documenting  the  information  on  the  AF  IMT  4303,  Helicopter  Landing Zone  Survey,  a  safety-of-flight  review,  and  final  approval.    Surveys  may  be accomplished  by  the  using  units  whose  equipment  or  personnel  are  being  landed  or 262 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 for an AIE.  The user must conduct a physical inspection of the HLZ prior to use to identify and evaluate potential hazards to personnel/equipment, man-made or natural structures,  and  ground  personnel.    If  the  survey  was  conducted  using  any  other method than GPS-derived coordinates, provide the reviewer with the raw coordinate data and the method of conversion. A18.8.1.2.2.  The  physical  inspection  of  the  HLZ  may  be  accomplished  utilizing  an airborne  asset.    In  this  instance  the  crew  will  perform  a  full  remote  site  evaluation.  The initial  approach will be conducted to  a hover to  visually inspect  the area below the  helicopter  prior  to  landing.    When  conducting  HLZ  surveys,  Alternate Insertion/Extraction (AIE) considerations will be included on the AF IMT 4303. A18.8.1.2.3.  A  1:50,000  scale  chart  or  less  should  be  used  when  available  for  the objective area for the ingress and egress.  Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS) or  Joint  Use  Mission  Planning  Software  (JUMPS)  may  be  used  instead  of  paper charts.    Ground  or  aerial  photographs  and  satellite  imagery  should  be  added  to  the survey  package.    Ensure  the  review  lists  all  obstructions  such  as  terrain,  towers,  or power lines that may  affect  the helicopter’s route of flight.   Also list any  prohibited areas, noise sensitive  areas, special use  airspace,  route of  flight  to  avoid  such areas, preferred  routing,  NOTAM  requirements,  etc.    Evaluation  of  terrain/obstructions should  consider  the  ability  to  fly  over  and/or  land  on  the  HLZ  or  hover  over  any obstruction.    If  these  criteria  cannot  be  met,  the  ingress  must  be  modified,  or  the review denied. A18.8.1.2.4.  When conducting operations on a HLZ that was previously surveyed by another  unit,  the  commander  of  the  using  unit  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the  HLZ meets  the  criteria  for  that  operation.    In  all  cases,  the  using  unit  must  accept responsibility  for  all  personnel  injuries,  parachute  or  load  damage,  and  property damage. A18.8.1.3.  HLZ  Review  Process.    The  following  paragraphs  outline  the  HLZ  review process from performing the initial groundwork to the final coordination.  All completed surveys  will  be  forwarded  to  the  OG/OGV  office  for  coordination.    Surveys  will  be reaccomplished  when  the  user  and/or  provider  determine  changes  in  the  ground  or  air aspects of the HLZ data require a new survey. A18.8.1.3.1.  The  HLZ  surveys  will  be  conducted  during  daylight  by  a  qualified combat  controller  or  any  qualified  helicopter  aircrew  member  (pilot/SMA).    The surveyor  (AF  IMT  4303,  item  4A)  performs  the  actual  ground  portion  of  the  HLZ survey (i.e., measurements, coordinates, calculating size, obtaining maps and creating diagrams)  and  annotates  results  on  the  AF  IMT  4303.    The  surveyor  may  be  a member  of  the  unit  that  intends  to  use  the  HLZ,  or  a  member  of  another  unit  may perform  the  ground  portion  of  a  survey  if  requested  and  time  permits.    To  facilitate future use of surveyed HLZs, initial surveys will encompass the largest area available and will not be limited by specific mission requirements.  The surveyor will forward the completed survey to the SQ/DO office for review.  Include recommended use, any deviations  from  HLZ  standards  contained  in  service  or  MAJCOM  directives,  and other pertinent remarks. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 263 A18.8.1.3.2.  The  AF  IMT  4303  reviewer  is  the  SQ/DO.    The  reviewer  (AF  IMT 4303,  item  4B)  ensures  the  HLZ  can  be  safely  used  from  a  flight  perspective.  Throughout  the  review  process,  HLZ  survey  packages  will  include  all  applicable maps, photos, charts and diagrams necessary to determine the safety and utility of the HLZ. A18.8.1.3.3.  Approval Authority (AF IMT 4303, item 4C).  Prior to use, surveys will be approved for air operations by the OG/CC.  This approval assures the review has been accomplished and the HLZ is considered safe for air operations. A18.8.1.3.4.  Once  item  4C  of  AF  IMT  4303  is  completed,  the  survey  is  ready  for use.  The SQ/DO will determine where HLZ surveys are maintained.  Surveys will be accessible to aircrews for use in pre-mission planning. A18.8.1.3.5.  HLZ surveys document the conditions that existed at the time the survey was  accomplished,  and  may  not  account  for  changes  to  seasonal  topography.  Recommended  uses  may  be  based  on  minimum  requirements  and  should  not  be misconstrued to be all-inclusive (i.e., a HLZ recommended for two UH-1s may not be suitable for a HH-60). It is the responsibility of the flying and ground units involved to  ensure  that  any  HLZ  being  considered  for  use  meets  the  requirements  for  their specific operation. A18.8.1.3.6.  Helicopter  Landing  Zone  Survey  Updates.    HLZ  surveys  will  be updated  every  six  months.    HLZs  that  are  not  updated  in  the  six-month  time  period will be considered closed for use until resurveyed using the above criteria (does not require  a  new  AF  IMT  4303).  The  absolute  minimum  to  update  a  HLZ  survey requires  a  qualified  combat  controller  or  qualified  helicopter  aircrew  member (pilot/SMA) to resurvey the HLZ during daylight.  This member must evaluate items 6  through  10  of  AF  IMT  4303.    Annotate  date  of  update  and  surveyor’s  initials  in remarks  section.    A  HLZ  survey  that  has  not  been  updated  for  12  months  is considered  expired  and  a  new  AF  IMT  4303  will  be  accomplished  and  rerouted  for approval. A18.8.1.4.  Expedited HLZ Surveys. The expedited HLZ survey process may be used to meet  specific  commander’s  objectives  when  time  constraints  exist  that  could  preclude completion of the full HLZ survey process in time to meet mission training requirements.   The  expedited  HLZ  survey  process  may  also  be  used  when  the  unit  has no  intention  of establishing and maintaining the HLZ as a  frequently used HLZ with  an  approved  IMT 4303 and subsequent periodic  reviews. A18.8.1.4.1.  Though  preferable,  the  use  of  an  AF  IMT  4303  is  not  required  for  an expedited HLZ survey.   Requests and surveys may  be passed electronically through the most expeditious media. Expedited survey requests should include, at a minimum, an  HLZ  name,  the  date  surveyed,  name  and  unit  of  surveying  personnel,  the  HLZ controlling agency and phone/e-mail contact information, long axis headings of HLZ, GPS  coordinates,  length/width,  slope,  elevation,  and  remarks  regarding  obstacles, hazards and surface conditions. A18.8.1.4.2.  Requests  for  expedited  HLZ  surveys  will  be  forwarded  to  the  OG/CC for final review. 264 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A18.8.1.4.3.  The  OG/CC’s  authorization  may  be  granted  for  landing  anywhere within defined geographic boundaries, such  as a test and training  range  complex, or grant a specific time frame authorization, usually associated with a specific exercise. A18.8.1.4.4.  These  areas  may  only  be  designated  after  a  thorough  survey  and  any exclusions are documented.  Prior to conducting operations in the designated area, the applicable  information  from  the  expedited  survey  will  be  made  available  to  the aircrew(s)  for  mission  planning.    If  there  are  probable  locations  for  HLZs,  include each location in the expedited HLZ survey request.  Use of HLZs that are approved by the applicable range group are highly encouraged.  Multiple possible landing areas within the boundaries may be utilized at the discretion of the aircraft commander. A18.8.1.4.5.  To assess an HLZ utilizing expedited HLZ survey rules, AFMC crews will adhere to the following methods (in order of precedence):  Overflight of the HLZ prior to the mission; use of aerial photography;  ground site survey/photography; use of satellite imagery; other methods like a PFPS map study. A18.8.2.  Operational  Site  Diagrams.    Operational  sites  are  areas  specifically  prepared  and maintained  for  helicopter  operations  (not  including  airports  or  helipads  listed  in  FLIP documents).  Squadron commanders will designate/approve permanent operational sites and develop  site  diagrams  in-unit.    These  sites  may  be  used  for  routine  landings  and  do  not require  a  full  remote  site  evaluation.      Diagrams  should  include  site  elevation,  location  of wind  indicator  (if  available),  significant  obstacles  (to  include  power/telephone  lines,  poles, antennas,  and  fences),  GPS  coordinates  and  any  unique  site  hazards.    If  there  are  any  sites with  unique  hazards,  the  unit  commander  should  ensure  there  is  a  method  of  highlighting these  hazards  to  the  crews.    Additionally,  the  unit  commander  coordinates  with  the  base safety,  operations  support,  and  civil  engineering  offices  to  determine  the  feasibility  of making  changes  to  the  site  to  eliminate  or  reduce  hazards.    Units  review  the  sites  annually and  annotate  the  review  date  in  the  site  folder.    Aircrews  planning  to  use  operational  sites should have access to site diagrams in flight.  AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 265 Attachment 19 HH-60 OPERATING PROCEDURES A19.1.  Operate the HH-60 IAW with approved test plans and applicable lead MAJCOM flight operations procedures. (T-2).  266 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 Attachment 20 KC10 OPERATING PROCEDURES A20.1.  General Information.  This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives, outlines  procedures  for  operation  of  the  KC-10    aircraft  under  most  circumstances.    AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all KC-10 aircraft must comply with  the  outlined  requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this  attachment.  Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment. A20.2.  Common Mission Guidance. A20.2.1.  Intersection  Takeoffs.    Intersection  takeoffs  are  authorized  if  available  runway length meets or exceeds the aircraft minimum runway length from Table 2.1. A20.2.2.  Landing Guidance.  The following landing limitations apply to  both touch-and-go and full stop landings: A20.2.2.1.  All pilots will plan to land on centerline within the touchdown zone. A20.2.2.2.  All  touchdowns  will  be  at  a  gross  weight  and  at  a  point  and  speed  that  will permit a safe, full stop landing in the remaining runway.  If this is not possible, initiate a go-around. A20.2.2.3.  The maximum crosswind component for takeoff and full stop landings is 31 knots or flight manual limits, whichever is less. A20.2.2.4.  Transition,  to  include  approaches  and  touch-and-go  landings,  can  be conducted up to Flight Manual gross weight limits. A20.2.2.5.  Do  not  land  on  approach  end  arresting  cables  (does  not  include  recessed cables).  If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower to have the  cable  inspected.    Do  not  takeoff  or  land  over  an  approach  end  cable  that  has  been reported slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAMs, ATIS, or ATC. A20.2.2.6.  Perform touch-and-go landings IAW this instruction and the applicable flight manual. A20.2.2.7.  Before final approach, the instructor pilot or qualified Mission Pilot (MP) will brief  touch-and-go  landing  considerations  with  the  other  appropriate  aircrew  members.  On  successive  approaches,  if  the  briefing  remains  the  same  and  there  are  no  questions, the  briefing  need  not  be  repeated  and  the  pilot  may  simply  state,  “Briefing  remains  the same.” A20.2.2.8.  Do not accomplish touch-and-go landings on slush-covered runways. A20.2.2.9.  The center gear will be extended for touch-and-go landings. A20.2.2.10.  A  minimum  of  9  wheel  brakes  must  be  operational.    Antiskid  on  all operational wheel brakes must be functioning normally. A20.3.  Instrument  Procedures.  The  KC-10  is  approach  category  D,  unless  gross  weight dictates category E. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 267 A20.4.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A20.4.1.  Prohibited  Maneuvers.    This  section  adds  aircraft  limitations  and  restrictions  to those  already  specified  in  flight  manuals  and  applies  to  all  aircrew.    Engine  out  training  is covered by AFI 11-2FTV3, Table 5.1.  The following maneuvers are prohibited unless on an approved test plan: A20.4.1.1.  Stalls. A20.4.1.2.  Dutch Roll. A20.4.1.3.  Emergency descents. A20.4.1.4.  Unusual attitudes. A20.4.2.  Air Refueling (AR) Limitations. A20.4.2.1.  Do not accomplish AR operations when: A20.4.2.1.1.  Conditions  are  encountered  which,  in  the  opinion  of  either  aircraft commander or the boom operator,  result in  marginal control of either the aircraft or the boom. A20.4.2.1.2.  Either the tanker or the receiver has less than the full number of engines operating (except B-52). A20.4.2.1.3.  The tanker aircraft is unable to retract the landing gear. A20.4.2.2.  Tanker  Autopilot.    Aircrews  will  notify  and  receive  acknowledgement  from the receiver pilot any time any axis of the autopilot is not being used. A20.4.2.3.  AR  without  tanker  disconnect  capability.    AR  without  tanker  disconnect capability means the boom operator cannot trigger an immediate disconnect using either the normal disconnect system or the independent disconnect system (IDS).  AR (tanker or receiver)  will  not  be  conducted  after  a  known  loss  of  tanker  disconnect  capability.  Exceptions to the restrictions are: A20.4.2.3.1.  During emergency fuel situations. A20.4.2.3.2.  When deployment/redeployment. necessary to complete receiver over-water A20.4.2.4.  Manual boom latching (MBL), emergency boom latching (EBL) and override boom  latching  (OBL).    The  MBL,  EBL  and  OBL  with  IDS  system  operative  may  be accomplished without restrictions.  To complete training or evaluation in MBL, EBL and OBL procedures without IDS, the following conditions must be met. A20.4.2.4.1.  An AR instructor pilot  must be at  a set  of controls  during the receiver contacts (if other than fighter type). A20.4.2.4.2.  Contacts will be limited to the minimum required. A20.4.2.4.3.  The receiver aircraft AR system must be fully operable. A20.4.2.4.4.  Boom operator and receiver pilot must coordinate all actions as required by  applicable  directives  and  checklists  when  making  contacts  during  the  situations listed above. 268 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A20.4.2.5.  Practice  Emergency  Separations.    Prior  to  the  actual  accomplishment  of  a practice emergency separation, coordination between the tanker pilot, boom operator and the  receiver  pilot  is  mandatory.    Coordination  must  include  when  the  separation  will occur  and  who will  give the command of  execution.  Tanker pilot  coordination may be accomplished  over  interphone  with  the  boom  operator.    Practice  emergency  separations may  be  accomplished  with  passengers  onboard.    Ensure  all  passengers  are  seated  with seat  belts  fastened.    Prior  to  a  practice  emergency  separation  from  the  contact  position when conducting AR behind a KC135, a disconnect capability must have been previously determined by a boom operator initiated disconnect. A20.4.2.6.  Limits Demonstration.  Prior to a limits demonstration, when conducting AR behind  a  KC135,  a  disconnect  capability  must  have  been  previously  determined  by  a boom operator initiated disconnect. A20.4.2.7.  Receiver  AR  Training.    A  qualified  receiver  IP  will  conduct  training.    The receiver pilot must inform and obtain acknowledgement from the tanker pilot and boom operator when an unqualified receiver pilot is receiving AR training.  During this time, a boom  operator  qualified  for  the  applicable  category  receiver  must  operate  the  boom controls, and if the tanker autopilot is off, the tanker must be flown by a pilot current and qualified in tanker AR. A20.4.2.8.  All  personnel  will  be  strapped  in  a  crew  position  during  either  receiver  or tanker AR operations unless a test plan requires personnel to be unrestrained. A20.4.2.9.  Altitude. A/R operations are normally conducted above 12,000 feet MSL, or 10,000  feet  AGL,  whichever  is  higher.  A/R  operations  based  at  or  above  12,000  feet MSL  which  momentarily  fall  below  10,000  feet  AGL,  but  not  lower  than  5,000  feet AGL, due to overflight of mountain ridges, peaks, etc., are authorized. A/R operations in support of C-130 receivers at the C-130's optimum refueling altitude, but no lower than 5,000 feet AGL are authorized. A/R performed below those altitudes will only be on an approved  test  plan  or  for  other  operational  considerations  approved  by  the  OG/CC.  Except  as  noted  above,  A/R  operations  below  10,000  feet  AGL  is  considered  Low Altitude Air Refueling (LAAR) and must comply with the following: A20.4.2.9.1.  A knowledgeable safety observer will be used. A20.4.2.9.2.  Perform during day, under VFR conditions. A20.4.2.9.3.  Minimum  altitude  is  3,000  feet  above  the  highest  obstacle  or  terrain within 4 NM of course centerline. A20.4.2.9.4.  Less than forecast, reported or observed moderate turbulence. A20.4.2.9.5.  Over  flat  and  rolling  terrain  or  a  minimum  of  10  NM  from  land  over contiguous water. A20.4.2.9.6.  Flight  manual  restrictions  for  low  altitude  operations  will  be  complied with. A20.4.3.  Cargo Loading Procedures.  The KC10 cargo loading will only be performed by a KC10 boom operator that was previously fully cargo qualified in AMC and has operational cargo  loading  experience.    This  restriction  does  not  apply  to  crew  chiefs  during  aircraft reconfiguration. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 269  270 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 Attachment 21 KC-46 OPERATING PROCEDURES A21.1.  Operate  the  KC-46  IAW  with  approved  test  plans  and  applicable  contractor  flight operations procedures. (T-2).  AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 271 Attachment 22 MQ-1 OPERATING PROCEDURES A22.1.  General Information. A22.1.1.  Scope.    This  attachment,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives,  outlines procedures  for  the  operation  of  the  MQ-1  Remotely  Piloted  Aircraft  (RPA)  under  most circumstances.  AFMC aircrews operating all MQ-1 aircraft must  comply  with  the outlined requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this  attachment.    Operations  or procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished  if  they  enhance  safe,  effective mission accomplishment. A22.2.  Mission Planning. A22.2.1.  Mission Planning Requirements.  The PIC is responsible for mission planning and briefing.    Mission  planning  and  briefing  are  two  separate  activities.    The  PIC  and  mission planners  (if  available)  will  jointly  review  mission  plans  to  ensure  safety  and  mission effectiveness.  Crewmembers other than the crew flying the mission may accomplish mission planning.    Commanders  will  ensure  currency  of  all  mission  planning  materials  and compliance with command guidance.  Squadron and Forward Operating Location operations officers will schedule adequate mission planning time prior to flight. A22.2.2.  Inflight  Publications.    FLIP  terminal  instrument  procedure  books  are  not  required in  the  GCS  except  when  operating  from  an  airfield  with  a  published  MQ-1  compatible approach.  If  the  MQ-1  compatible  approaches  are  separately  published  plates,  then  only those plates are required in the GCS. If units annotate the ground track from compatible MQ-1  approach  plates  on  the  PSO  Tracker  display  chart,  it  will  be  to  scale  and  reflect  current FLIP  products.    A  taxi  diagram  will  be  loaded  in  both  PSO  racks  or  in  the  GCS  for  the aircrew to reference. A22.2.3.  Local  Area  Maps  And  Inflight  Guides.    A  local  area  map  of  sufficient  detail  to remain  within  assigned  operational  or  training  areas  will  be  available  to  crewmembers  and displayed in  the GCS.   Units will ensure that,  as a minimum,  the PSO racks contain  charts that are accurate enough to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft. Maps, charts, and FLIP required for navigation for both the planned IFR and VFR phases of flight shall be available to the aircrew at all times. A22.2.4.  Briefing/De-briefing. A22.2.4.1.  Briefing  Attendees.  Crewmembers  who  are  logging  individual  events  for currency do not need to attend the mission briefing iaw Chapter 2, however, they must receive  a  changeover  brief  in  their  respective  crew  position  before  participating  in  the flight. Other crewmembers who did not attend a mission briefing must obtain Squadron Operations  Officer  (SQ/DO)  approval  prior  to  participating  in  a  flight.  The  pilot  in command  or  MC  will  ensure  crewmembers  participating  in  a  flight  under  SQ/DO approval are adequately briefed prior to assuming crew duties. A22.2.4.2.  Brief  Content.    A  Go/No-Go  and  Operational  Risk  Management  (ORM) checklist  will be completed by the aircraft commander with  all available  crewmembers. Any subsequent  PIC with crewmembers  who did not  attend the  flight  briefing will also 272 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 perform these actions.  The extent and depth of the briefings will depend on the type of flight,  complexity  of  the  tests  and  equipment,  previous  mission  and  flight  crew experience.    Those  items  published  in  unit  standards  and  understood  by  all  participants may  be  briefed  as  “standard.”    Mission  briefings  will  be  accomplished  IAW  Mission Briefing Guides contained within the unit In-Flight Guides. A22.2.4.2.1.  In-flight  Changes.    Do  not  fly  unbriefed  missions  and/or  events.    If operationally necessary, mission elements and events may be modified while the MQ-1 is airborne as long as changes do not compromise flight safety.  The PIC will ensure all crewmembers understand any changes. A22.2.4.3.  Crew  Change/Handover  Brief.    When  conducting  handover  operations  the LRE and MCE pilots should carefully plan and coordinate handover locations, times, and other  mission  pertinent  information.    Emphasis  should  be  placed  on  notifying  the  other element of current mission status, mission accomplishment, items not accomplished, and any deviations from previously coordinated operations. A22.2.5.  Crew.  The  crew  is  defined  as  the  personnel  responsible  for  safe  operation  of  the MQ-1 aircraft.  For the MQ-1, the term pilot refers to a pilot in the LRE or MCE. A22.2.5.1.  Pilot-in-command  (PIC).    An  aircraft  commander  will  be  designated  in  the flight  authorization  IAW  AFI  11-401.    For  sorties  with  multiple  crews,  a  PIC  will  be designated for each crew. A22.2.5.2.  Pilot/Sensor Operator (PSO) racks.  For normal ground and flight operations, the pilot in control of the aircraft will occupy the left seat unless equipment malfunctions dictate use of an alternate control rack.  In addition, during critical phases of flight, a pilot or sensor operator must be in the right seat.  The crewmember in the right seat will act as a  safety  monitor  while  operating  the  Multi-Spectral  Targeting  System  (MTS)  to  ensure the safety of the aircraft and ground personnel. A22.2.6.  Flight  Plan.    When  required  by  the  FAA  CoA,  the  PIC  or  delegated  shall  file  a flight plan prior to flight.  A flight plan may not be required due to the unique nature of RPA operations.    The  PIC’s  initials  on  the  Flight  Authorization  (AF  IMT  4327a)  cover  the requirements stipulated in AFI 11-202V3. A22.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A22.3.1.  Ground Control Station (GCS). A22.3.1.1.  The  GCS  will  be  considered  the  flight  deck  of  the  aircraft  under  operation with no exceptions. A22.3.1.2.  At the beginning of every  flight,  the PIC will display the appropriate access signs on the GCS entry points. A22.3.1.3.  Critical phases of flight: takeoff to initial climb configuration; final approach to  touchdown  (or  low  approach);  LRE  to  MCE  (and  vice  versa)  handover  operations; medium  or  high  risk  test  point  execution,  and  terminal  attack  sequences  (maneuver-to-attack to weapons impact). A22.3.1.4.  Crews  will  maintain  a  sterile  environment  consistent  with  good  CRM procedures during all critical phases of flight or at PIC discretion. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 273 A22.3.1.5.  GCS  Entry  Procdeures.  GCS  Entry  is  at  PIC  discretion.  The  PIC  has  final authority  on  number  of  personnel  in  the  GCS.  The  PIC  can  designate  the  technician  to limit the nonessential personnel within the GCS. Technicians should post an access sign instructing  personnel  to  call  for  entry.    During  an  emergency  situation,  requested personnel  can  enter  the  rear  door  without  calling.  Exit  from  the  GCS  through  the  rear door.  If  no  rear  exit  is  available,  coordinate  with  the  PIC  prior  to  entering  or  exiting. Talking should be minimized and only if necessary for the execution of the mission in the GCS.  During all phases of flight there will be no entry or exit through the forward door, unless the GCS does not have an aft door. A22.3.1.6.  Aircrew  will  not  answer  pages  in  the  GCS  and  the  PA  system  should  be turned down in  volume.  The PA can be used to  perform communication as outlined in the appropriate airfield ground and flight operations procedures documents. A22.3.1.7.  Limitations/Restrictions.  While in the GCS, crewmembers will operate only those electronic items necessary for flight and/or mission operations. A22.3.1.8.  Landline  usage is authorized in the GCS while the RPA is in flight. The use of  personal  cell  phones  is  not  allowed  except  in  emergency  or  NORDO  situations  as authorized by the PIC.  If crewmembers are unable to answer the phone, a technician may answer and ask the crew if they are able to take the call. A22.3.1.9.  Smoking is prohibited in or within 50 feet of the GCS. A22.3.2.  Checklists. A22.3.2.1.  Aircrew  will  not  place  items  (checklists,  charts,  etc.)  behind  the  flap  lever, propeller control lever, throttle, or speed lever at any time. Aircrew will ensure no items interfere with aircraft controls or the Heads-Down Displays (HDD).  Items may be placed on the shelf above the HDD. A22.3.2.2.  Each  crewmember  will  reference  applicable  checklists  during  all  phases  of flight.    The  PIC  is  responsible  for  checklist  completion.    Electronic  checklists  are authorized for use however spare electronic or paper copy checklists must be available to each crewmember should failure of the primary checklist source occur. A22.3.2.3.  Aircrews  should  make  every  effort  to  avoid  non-essential  tasks  when  below 2,000 feet AGL. A22.3.2.4.  Approved  checklists  contained  within  AFTTP  3-1.Predator  and  AFTTP  3-3 Predator are authorized for use during weapons deliveries. A22.3.2.5.  Setting  up  a  GCS  for  another  crew  (also  referred  to  as  “running  presets”) shall  be  avoided  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.  Local  OG/CCs  may  authorize  a qualified  crew  other  than  the  gaining  handover  crew  to  execute  gaining  handover checklist  procedures  where  local  procedures  are  adopted  and  published  which  provide guidance to accomplish this practice safely. The gaining handover PIC is responsible for the  completion  of  all  checklists  necessary  to  gain  control  of  the  aircraft  regardless  of checklist items briefed as complete. A22.3.2.5.1.  Aircrews will advise the operations supervisor a GCS is being set up for a later crew. 274 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A22.3.3.  Required Equipment. A22.3.3.1.  Video Sources.  Two separate video sources are required for flight operations.  At least one nose camera, either EO or IR, must be available. A22.3.3.2.  INS/GPS A22.3.3.2.1.  Both  the  inertial  navigation  system  (INS)  and  global  positioning systems (GPS) must be operational. A22.3.3.3.  Transponder.    The  aircraft  shall  have  an  operable  transponder  with  altitude encoding  for  all  flights,  unless  the  PIC  has  contacted  the  controlling  facility  and  been given permission to fly without it.  The PIC should get the name and phone number of the individual at the controlling facility granting permission to fly the mission. A22.3.3.4.  Sensor  Equipment  at  Night.    A  minimum  of  one  IR  sensor  must  be operational for any mission with planned operations between the hours of official sunset and official sunrise. A22.3.3.5.  Data Recording.  GCS shall have HUD Video for each PSO with operational voice recording. A22.3.3.6.  Ground  Crew  Communication.    Two  way  communications  are  required between the pilot and ground crew during all ground operations and airborne operations that require ground crew participation. A22.3.4.  Engine Starts.  The engine will only be started on the command of the pilot and all engine starts require a fire guard. A22.3.5.  Taxi Operations. A22.3.5.1.  Maintain  safe  taxi  speeds  at  all  times.    Maximum  taxi  speed  is  10  knots ground speed on taxiways and 20 knots ground speed on runways.  Maximum taxi speed is 5 knots ground speed in turns. A22.3.5.2.  Do not taxi over arresting gear (i.e. BAK 9/12 or BAK-14). A22.3.5.3.  Prior to arm/de-arm, pilots will notify the ground crew that hands are clear of all aircraft controls. A22.3.5.4.  Aircrew  will  will  not  taxi  an  aircraft  within  25  feet  of  obstructions  without wing walkers unless exempted or waived. A22.3.5.5.  The  sensor  operator  will  use  the  MTS  to  ensure  the  aircraft  is  clear  of obstructions  during  taxi  operations.  The  sensor  operator  will  obtain  clearance  from  the pilot prior to releasing the MTS from position mode. A22.3.5.6.  If  the  pilot  is  only  using  the  MTS  to  taxi,  the  aircraft  will  be  brought  to  a complete stop before releasing the MTS from position mode. The MTS will be placed in position mode prior to resuming taxi. A22.3.5.7.  Pilots  will  exercise  caution  and  increase  following  distance  when  taxiing behind heavy or jet powered aircraft. A22.3.5.8.  Prior  to  unpinning/arming,  pilots  will  confirm  with  the  ground  crew  that hands and feet are clear of all aircraft controls and parking brake is set. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 275 A22.3.6.  Takeoff/Departure. A22.3.6.1.  For takeoff, the sensor operator will select a different HUD video source and camera from the one selected by the pilot. A22.3.6.2.  Do  not  takeoff,  land  or  accomplish  touch-and-go  landings  over  raised webbing-type  barriers  (e.g.,  MA-1A,  61QSII).    Pilots  may  takeoff,  land  or  accomplish touch-and-go  landings  before,  beyond  or  between  raised  cables  or  barriers  provided  the available distance meets minimum runway length requirements. A22.3.6.3.  Command  the  MTS  to  position  mode  whenever  below  500’  AGL.    Above 500’  AGL  and  with  pilot  concurrence,  the  sensor  operator  may  use  the  MTS  at  their discretion. A22.3.6.4.  Maintain an engine-out glideback capability to the maximum extent possible. A22.3.6.5.  For initial takeoffs on test sorties, do not takeoff if the computed ground roll exceeds  80%  if    the  available  runway.  Additionally,    the  available  runway  for  landing must exceed total planned landing distance by at least 500 feet.  This is meant to apply to emergency heavy weight landings that occur immediately after takeoff.  Attempt to dump fuel or jettison ordnance to reduce gross weight and landing distance.  In all other cases, landings will be planned so that the available runway exceeds landing distance by at least 1000 feet. A22.3.6.6.  The sensor operator will place the MTS in  position mode for takeoff. Flight graphics will be displayed on both PSO racks until at least 500 ft. AGL. A22.3.7.  Ops Checks. A22.3.7.1.  Accomplish  sufficient  ops  checks  to  ensure  safe  mission  execution.    Time between ops checks will not exceed one hour. A22.3.7.2.  Minimum items to check are: communication links, engine instruments, total fuel quantity and distribution, current feeding fuel tank, and aircraft weight. A22.3.8.  Enroute.    PICs  shall  maintain  normal  VFR/IFR  separation  utilizing  chase  aircraft and two way radio communications with a controlling agency.  If flying within the National Airspace  System  (NAS),  the  PIC  will  request  flight  following  from  ATC  as  much  as possible. A22.3.9.  Recovery.    The  normal  procedure  is  to  bring  the  RPA  into  visual  range  of  the ground  crew.    Once  the  aircraft  has  landed,  the  aircrew  may  clear  the  chase  aircraft  off  by stating “CLEARED OFF”.  Once cleared off, chase will either leave the area of operations or orbit south of the field and land after the runway is clear. A22.3.10.  Approach and Landing. A22.3.10.1.  Stabilized Approach.  Stabilized approach is defined as payload in position mode,  configured  for  landing,  normal  glidepath,  and  on  target  airspeed  (minus  5  KIAS and plus 15 KIAS).  Aircraft must be stabilized by 200 feet AGL.  If the aircraft becomes un-stabilized below 200 feet AGL, or if the following sink rate limits are exceeded, a go around is mandatory.  Sink rate limits:  1200 feet per minute (FPM) descent rate below 200 feet AGL and 600 FPM below 50 feet AGL.  Momentary deviations do not require a go around as long as immediate corrective actions are taken. 276 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A22.3.10.2.  The desired touchdown zone for a visual approach is 500 to 1500 feet from the threshold, or the glide path interception point for a precision approach.  When local procedures or unique runway surface conditions require landing beyond a given point on the  runway,  adjust  the  desired  touchdown  zone  accordingly  and  brief  applicable crewmembers. A22.3.10.3.  During a go-around or low approach, do not fly directly over aircraft on the runway at low altitude. A22.3.10.4.  Comply  with  the  wake  turbulence  avoidance  criteria  for  a  small  aircraft (category 1). A22.3.10.5.  Pilots will not practice EO nose-camera landings at night. A22.3.10.6.  The crewmember in the right seat will announce altitude deviations (plus or minus)  exceeding  100  feet  at  the  initial  approach  fix  and  the  final  approach  fix.    The crewmember  in  the  right  seat  will  announce  “DECISION  HEIGHT”  or  “MDA” (Minimum  Descent  Altitude)  when  reaching  these  altitudes  for  precision  and  non-precision approaches. A22.3.10.7.  The MTS will be placed in position mode and flight  graphics displayed on both PSO racks prior to descending below 500 feet AGL. A22.3.10.8.  For  landing,  the  SO  will  select  a  different  HUD  video  source  and  camera from the one selected by the pilot. SO should confirm Payload position by checking VIT 11. A22.3.10.9.  If  the  MTS  is  the  only  available  video  source  for  landing,  the  SO  will  not conduct a non-uniformity correction (NUC) of the MTS on final approach without prior coordination with the PIC.  If the MTS is not suitable for landing below 1,500 feel AGL on final  approach,  and no other video sources  are available, the crew must  initiate a go around. A22.3.10.10.  Above Maximum  Allowable Gross Weight  (MAGW) Operations.  Above MAGW  operations  may  require  an  OG/CC  waiver.  (Expections:  Emergancy,  part  of Approved Test Card/Plan). A22.3.11.  Chase Operations. A22.3.11.1.  Chase  Crew  Requirements.    Two  pilots  are  required  for  night  chase operations.  The safety pilot (pilot not flying) is responsible for clearing for traffic while the pilot flying is responsible for maintaining aircraft control and visual separation with the RPA.  Two pilots are also required when oxygen is required by FAA regulations.  A single pilot may be used in day chase missions. A22.3.11.2.  It is the chase aircraft’s responsibility to advise the RPA aircrew if the flight path  indicates  a  possible  conflict  with  other  aircraft  or  weather.    Two-way  radio communication will be maintained between the chase aircraft and the RPA.  If there has been no communication between the chase aircraft and the RPA in the last 15 minutes, a radio check between the two aircraft will be accomplished. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 277 A22.3.11.3.  Weather  Minimums.    Chase  operations  will  be  conducted  in  VMC.    For rejoins  underneath  a  ceiling,  minimum  ceiling/visibility  criteria  are  1000  feet/3  NM  for day, 3000 feet/3 NM for night. A22.3.11.4.  Altitude Minimums.  Chase aircraft will not go below 500 feet AGL during chase  procedures  in  day/VMC  conditions.    Chase  aircraft  will  not  go  below  minimum safe altitude (MSA) during chase procedures at night.  MSA is defined as 1000 feet above the  highest  obstacle  in  the  defined  testing/training  area  and  will  be  briefed  on  every mission. (Recommend the MSA be based on a 5 NM radius from the RPA.) A22.3.11.5.  Distance  Minimums.   Chase  aircraft  will  maintain  300  feet  to  1500  feet  of separation from the RPA.  Chase aircraft should maintain a slight stack and 2 to 5 aspect on the RPA. A22.3.11.6.  Equipment  Procedures.    The  chase  aircraft  and  the  RPA  will  have  their beacons  and  strobe  lights  on  during  daylight  operations  to  increase  visibility  for  other aircraft. A22.3.11.7.  The  RPA  will  squawk  the  transponder  code  for  the  formation.    The  chase aircraft  will  squawk  standby  and  be  ready  to  squawk  for  the  formation  in  the  event  the RPA’s transponder fails. A22.3.11.8.  The  chase  crew  will  call  “READY  FOR  REJOIN”  when  in  position  and visual  the  RPA.    Additionally,  the  chase  crew  will  report  all  gear  up  and  gear  down positions. A22.3.11.9.  The  RPA  will  call  all  turns  at  night  or  in  close  formation,  as  well  as  all altitude and airspeed changes. A22.3.12.  Lost Communication. A22.3.12.1.  RPA  Lost  Communication.    If  the  chase  aircraft  detects  the  RPA  is  lost comm, the chase crew will contact the RPA ops desk and direct the RPA to recover to the local  area.    If  the  RPA  does  not  recover,  chase  crew  will  provide  ATC  with  the  actual position and probable destination of the RPA.  If the chase aircraft cannot safely continue to execute chase responsibilities (maintain VMC, chase low on fuel, a potential threat of a collision  exists,  etc.),  the  chase  aircraft  will  proceed  to  and  loiter,  well  clear  of  the landing  runway.    If  radio  communications  are  regained,  chase  aircraft  will  request  to rejoin.  Otherwise, the chase aircraft will return to base (RTB). A22.3.12.2.  Chase  Aircraft  Lost  Communication. communication failure with the chase aircraft, the RPA crew will RTB.   If  the  RPA  crew  detects  a A22.3.13.  Loss  of  Visual  Contact.    If  the  chase  aircraft  loses  visual  contact  with  the  RPA, immediate separation is essential.  Upon losing sight of the RPA, the chase aircraft will call “BLIND”  with  altitude  over  the  radio.    The  RPA  will  acknowledge  the  blind  call  and immediately transmit heading, altitude, and airspeed.  The RPA will remain predictable and continue its current flight path unless directed otherwise.  The sensor operator will utilize the MTS  (if  available)  in  an  attempt  to  clear  the  RPA  flight  path  and  avoid  a  collision.    The chase  aircraft  will  obtain  a  minimum  of  500  feet  altitude  separation  until  visual  contact  is regained.    If  visual  contact  is  lost  for  more  than  30  seconds,  chase  aircraft  will  request 278 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 assistance  from  ATC  to  reacquire  the  visual.  While  the  chase  aircraft  is  visually  searching, the RPA will make position reports and call turns. A22.3.14.  Encountering  IMC.    The  chase  aircraft  should  be  directive  to  avoid  IMC penetration;  however,  if  an  inadvertent  IMC  penetration  occurs  resulting  in  loss  of  visual, immediate  separation  from  the  RPA  is  essential.    Smooth  application  of  control  inputs  is imperative  to  minimize  the  effects  of  spatial  disorientation.    The  chase  aircraft  will simultaneously transition to instruments, maneuver away from the last known RPA position, and call “BLIND, POPEYE” over the radio.   The RPA aircrew will acknowledge the blind call  and  immediately  transmit  heading,  altitude,  and  airspeed.    The  RPA  will  remain predictable  and  maintain  its  current  flight  path  unless  directed  otherwise.    The  sensor operator will utilize the MTS (if available) to clear the RPA’s flight path.  The chase aircraft will  obtain  a  minimum  of  500  feet  altitude  separation  until  visual  contact  is  regained.    If visual  contact  is  lost  for  more  than  30  seconds,  chase  aircraft  will  request  assistance  from ATC to reacquire the visual. While the chase aircraft is visually searching, the RPA aircrew will  make  position  reports  and  call  turns.    The  chase  aircraft  and  the  RPA  will  coordinate separate ATC clearances to ensure separation with each other as well as other aircraft (IFR clearance, squawk, etc).  Once clear of IMC and visual the chase aircraft will request rejoin with the RPA. A22.3.15.  Chase Rejoins. A22.3.15.1.  Takeoff.    This  is  the  preferred  method  of  rejoin.    Chase  aircraft  will normally takeoff prior to the RPA, loiter south of the field and call “IN POSITION” on the  Common  Traffic  Advisory  Frequency  (CTAF)  or  other  pre-briefed  frequency.    The RPA  aircrew  will  announce  takeoff  on  the  CTAF.  Chase  aircraft  will  keep  the  RPA  in sight,  climb  with  it,  and  plan  to  rejoin  by  2000  feet  AGL.    Chase  aircraft  will  not  go below final approach speed during rejoin. A22.3.15.2.  In-flight. If the RPA is airborne prior to the chase aircraft’s arrival, the chase aircraft will remain south of the runway environment  until visual.  The RPA will assist the rejoin by stating the RPA’s location, heading, airspeed and altitude.  Once visual, the chase aircraft will request to rejoin. A22.4.  Instrument Procedures. A22.4.1.  The MQ-1 is an approach category A aircraft. A22.4.2.  Weather Minimums, Restrictions, and Planning Factors.  The MQ-1 is a turbulence category III aircraft. A22.4.2.1.  All flights shall be conducted under VFR conditions throughout the planned route of flight (1500 feet ceiling,  3 SM visibility, +/- 1 hr ETA).  Pilots will maneuver the  aircraft  so  as  to  maintain  appropriate  VFR  cloud  clearances  during  departure,  en-route, and recovery IAW AFI 11-202V3 A22.4.2.2.  Operating  the  MQ-1  with  ceiling  and/or  visibility  below  VFR  minimums requires  a  published  airport  surveillance  radar  or  precision  approach  radar  terminal approach  procedure  at  the  operating  airfield.    The  MQ-1  INS/GPS  is  not  certified  for flying GPS instrument approaches. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 279 A22.4.2.3.  Normally,  declaring  an  alternate  airfield  is  not  an  available  option  for  the MQ-1 unless the airfield has a pre-positioned GCS (or LRGCS).  If a pre-positioned GCS is available, use published alternate weather requirements IAW AFI 11-202V3.  Holding (instead of an alternate airport) is authorized for RPA operations.  While airborne, if the actual weather deteriorates below 1500 feet ceiling or the visibility is below 3 SM, MQ-1 crewmembers  will  increase  recovery  fuel  to  allow  the  aircraft  to  hold  for  at  least  one hour, in addition to, normal recovery fuel. A22.4.2.4.  When  the  ceiling  is  below  3,000  feet  or  the  visibility  is  below  3  miles, crewmembers will increase recovery fuel to allow the aircraft to hold for a minimum of two  hours  at  best  endurance,  then  penetrate  and  land  with  normal  recovery  fuel.  This visibility requirement does not  apply if the MTS  IR camera is  operable and visibility is below minimums due to sand/dust. A22.4.2.5.  While  airborne,  if  the  actual  weather  deteriorates  below  forecasted  and  is below  the  minima  specified  at  the  actual  time  of  arrival,  pilots  are  authorized  to  fly  to pilot  weather  category  or  published  approach  minimums,  whichever  is  higher,  if necessary to recover the aircraft. A22.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A22.5.1.  Wind. A22.5.1.1.  Actual  winds  must  be  within  flight  manual  limits  at  takeoff  and  landing.  Forecast winds must be within flight manual limits at ETA (±1 hour). A22.5.1.2.  While  airborne,  if  revised  forecast  winds  for  ETA  (±1  hour)  exceed  limits specified in the flight manual, the pilot will terminate the mission in time to return to the operating  base  before  the  forecast  time  of  increased  winds,  or  terminate  the  mission  in time  to  return  to  the  operating  base  with  sufficient  fuel  to  fly  low  approaches  for  a minimum of two hours (or as directed by Local Operating Procedures) unless a suitable alternate is available. A22.5.1.3.  If  sufficient  fuel  remains  and  mission  allows,  the  pilot  may  establish  a  new ETA to overfly the forecast period of increased winds.  The fuel requirements specified in Table 2.1 must be complied with for any updated ETA. A22.5.2.  Turbulance: Aircrews will not takeoff if forecast or reported severe turbulence for Light/Category I aircraft is present along the route of flight. A22.5.3.  Thunderstorms  and  Lightning.    Lightning  strikes  and  electrostatic  discharges  can occur  in  what  may  look  like  bening  conditions.    All  flight  and  ground  operations  are prohibited  when  lightning  is  reported  within  five  (5)  nautical  miles  of  the  airfield.    All ground  operations  are  prohibited  if  thunderstorms  are  producing  hazardous  conditions  such as hail, strong winds above 30 knots, heavy rain or lightning. A22.5.3.1.  The  PIC  will  not  operate  the  aircraft  within  25  NM  of  known  thunderstorm activity. A22.5.4.  Cold-Weather  Operating  Procedures.    Do  not  takeoff  with  frost,  ice  or  snow accumulation  on  the  wings.    Whenever  the  outside  air  temperature  is  less  than  40  degrees Fahrenheit  or  the  pilot  is  concerned  about  frost,  ice  or  snow,  apply  an  ice  retardant  to  the wings  or  inspect  the  aircraft  for  frost  immediately  prior  to  takeoff.    Pilots  should  avoid 280 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 penetration of visible moisture or precipitation to the maximum extent possible, particularly above the freezing level.  If precipitation cannot be avoided, pilots should maximize climb or descent rate to exit potential or actual icing conditions. A22.5.4.1.  Icing Procedures.  Do not conduct flight into forecast icing greater than light.  Do not  conduct  flight  into known icing conditions.    If encountering icing in flight,  take action to exit icing conditions immediately. A22.5.5.  Runway/Taxiway  Conditions.    Units  will  specify  minimum  runway  condition reading (RCR) for taxi operations. Do not takeoff or land with an RCR less than 12 (waiver authority  is  OG/CC).  When  no  RCR  is  available,  refer  to  International  Civil  Aviation Organization  conversions  in  the  Flight  Information  Handbook.    Handling  characteristics  of the MQ-1 on ice or snow are not optimum.  Minimize power settings to limit taxi speed to no more  than  5  KGS.    If  required  to  stop,  try  to  stop  over  clear  portions  of  the  taxiway.    The pilot will remain focused on the outside video display at all times. A22.6.  Air-To-Surface Operations. A22.6.1.  Live/Heavyweight Ordnance Procedures. A22.6.1.1.  IMC Weapons Deliveries.  Pilots may release live or inert weapons in or thru IMC  IAW  the  following  procedures,  unless  restricted  by  range  procedures  or  theater ROE (verification requirements against known target coordinates only applies to training sorties): A22.6.1.2.  Master Arm switch.  When carrying releasable ordnance, configure IAW 11-214. A22.6.1.2.1.  The  use  of  Master  Arm  and  release  switches  is  authorized  when  not carrying releasable ordnance.  When carrying releasable ordnance, remain two switch positions  away  from  release  at  all  times  prior  to  intentionally  releasing  live  or  inert ordnance. The two deselected switches will be the master arm switch and the trigger. A22.6.1.3.  Crews  will  perform  battle  damage  and  weapons  checks  prior  to  or  during RTB.    This  check  is  mandatory  following  expenditure  of  live  ordnance.    If  unable  to complete  the  check  using  organic  sensors,  request  support  from  the  chase  aircraft  or  a ground observer before landing. A22.7.  Abnormal Procedures A22.7.1.  Ground Emergencies. A22.7.1.1.  Pilots  will  not  taxi  with  nose-wheel  steering,  brake  system,  video  path,  or telemetry/datalink malfunctions. A22.7.1.2.  In  the  event  of  an  inadvertent  entry  onto  soft  or  unprepared  surfaces,  pilots will  not  attempt  to  recover  the  aircraft  to  the  prepared  surface  by  using  engine  power and/or differential braking. A22.7.2.  In-flight Emergencies. A22.7.2.1.  Air Aborts.  Abort the mission, regardless of apparent damage or subsequent normal operation, if any of the following occur: bird strike, Over-G, flight control system anomalies (including uncommanded flight control inputs), or engine failure. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 281 A22.7.2.2.  Landing Gear Malfunctions.  If encountering a landing gear malfunction and the gear are down, leave them down and do not make touch and go landings. A22.7.2.3.  Forced  Landing.    Comply  with  forced  landing  procedures  in  the  flight manual.  If  a  Ku-band  forced  landing  to  a  runway  or  primary  site  cannot  be  completed without  endangering  personnel  or  property  on  the  ground,  then  another  site  will  be selected even if attempting a landing at that alternate site may result in destruction of the aircraft. A22.7.3.  Emergency Mission Planning.  Maintain awareness of current and forecast weather along the planned and emergency mission routes of flight, and at the intended landing field.  Update  the  emergency  mission  route  for  weather  hazards  (e.g.,  cloud  layers,  icing, turbulence,  etc.)  throughout  the  flight.    Alter  the  route,  if  necessary,  and  use  care  to  select appropriate aircraft parameters to avoid hazardous weather conditions.  282 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 Attachment 23 MQ-9 OPERATING PROCEDURES A23.1.  General Information. A23.1.1.  Scope.    This  attachment,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives,  outlines procedures  for  the  operation  of  the  MQ-9  Remotely  Piloted  Aircraft  (RPA)  under  most circumstances.  AFMC aircrews operating all MQ-9 aircraft must comply  with  the outlined requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this  attachment.    Operations  or procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished  if  they  enhance  safe,  effective mission accomplishment. A23.2.  Mission Planning. A23.2.1.  Mission Planning Requirements.  The PIC is responsible for mission planning and briefing.    Mission  planning  and  briefing  are  two  separate  activities.    The  PIC  and  mission planners  (if  available)  will  jointly  review  mission  plans  to  ensure  safety  and  mission effectiveness.  Crewmembers other than the crew flying the mission may accomplish mission planning.    Commanders  will  ensure  currency  of  all  mission  planning  materials  and compliance with command guidance.  Squadron and Forward Operating Location operations officers will schedule adequate mission planning time prior to flight. A23.2.2.  Inflight  Publications.    FLIP  terminal  instrument  procedure  books  are  not  required in  the  GCS  except  when  operating  from  an  airfield  with  a  published  MQ-9  compatible approach.  If  the  MQ-9  compatible  approaches  are  separately  published  plates,  then  only those plates are required in the GCS. If units annotate the ground track from compatible MQ-9  approach  plates  on  the  PSO  Tracker  display  chart,  it  will  be  to  scale  and  reflect  current FLIP products A taxi diagram will be loaded in both PSO racks or in the GCS for the aircrew to reference. A23.2.3.  Local  Area  Maps  And  Inflight  Guides.    A  local  area  map  of  sufficient  detail  to remain  within  assigned  operational  or  training  areas  will  be  available  to  crewmembers  and displayed in  the GCS.   Units will ensure that,  as a minimum,  the PSO racks contain  charts that are accurate enough to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft. Maps, charts, and FLIP required for navigation for both the planned IFR and VFR phases of flight shall be available to the aircrew at all times. A23.2.4.  Briefing/De-briefing. A23.2.4.1.  Briefing  Attendees.  Crewmembers  who  are  logging  individual  events  for currency do not need to attend the mission briefing iaw Chapter 2, however, they must receive  a  changeover  brief  in  their  respective  crew  position  before  participating  in  the flight. Other crewmembers who did not attend a mission briefing must obtain Squadron Operations  Officer  (SQ/DO)  approval  prior  to  participating  in  a  flight.  The  pilot  in command  or  MC  will  ensure  crewmembers  participating  in  a  flight  under  SQ/DO approval are adequately briefed prior to assuming crew duties. A23.2.4.2.  Brief  Content.    A  Go/No-Go  and  Operational  Risk  Management  (ORM) checklist  will be completed by the aircraft commander with  all available  crewmembers. Any subsequent  PIC with crewmembers  who did not  attend the  flight  briefing will also AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 283 perform these actions.  The extent and depth of the briefings will depend on the type of flight,  complexity  of  the  tests  and  equipment,  previous  mission  and  flight  crew experience.    Those  items  published  in  unit  standards  and  understood  by  all  participants may  be  briefed  as  “standard.”    Mission  briefings  will  be  accomplished  IAW  Mission Briefing Guides contained within the unit In-Flight Guides. A23.2.4.2.1.  In-flight  Changes.    Do  not  fly  unbriefed  missions  and/or  events.    If operationally necessary, mission elements and events may be modified while the MQ-1 is airborne as long as changes do not compromise flight safety.  The PIC will ensure all crewmembers understand any changes. A23.2.4.3.  Crew  Change/Handover  Brief.    When  conducting  handover  operations  the LRE and MCE pilots should carefully plan and coordinate handover locations, times, and other  mission  pertinent  information.    Emphasis  should  be  placed  on  notifying  the  other element of current mission status, mission accomplishment, items not accomplished, and any deviations from previously coordinated operations. A23.2.5.  Crew.  The  crew  is  defined  as  the  personnel  responsible  for  safe  operation  of  the MQ-1 aircraft.  For the MQ-1, the term pilot refers to a pilot in the LRE or MCE . A23.2.5.1.  Pilot-in-command  (PIC).    An  aircraft  commander  will  be  designated  in  the flight  authorization  IAW  AFI  11-401.    For  sorties  with  multiple  crews,  a  PIC  will  be designated for each crew. A23.2.5.2.  Pilot/Sensor Operator (PSO) racks.  For normal ground and flight operations, the pilot in control of the aircraft will occupy the left seat unless equipment malfunctions dictate use of an alternate control rack.  In addition, during critical phases of flight, a pilot or sensor operator must be in the right seat.  The crewmember in the right seat will act as a  safety  monitor  while  operating  the  Multi-Spectral  Targeting  System  (MTS)  to  ensure the safety of the aircraft and ground personnel. A23.2.6.  Flight  Plan.    When  required  by  the  FAA  CoA,  the  PIC  or  delegated  shall  file  a flight plan prior to flight.  A flight plan may not be required due to the unique nature of RPA operations.    The  PIC’s  initials  on  the  Flight  Authorization  (AF  IMT  4327a)  cover  the requirements stipulated in AFI 11-202V3. A23.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A23.3.1.  Ground Control Station (GCS). A23.3.1.1.  The  GCS  will  be  considered  the  flight  deck  of  the  aircraft  under  operation with no exceptions. A23.3.1.2.  At the beginning of every flight,  the PIC will display the appropriate access signs on the GCS entry points. A23.3.1.3.  Critical phases of flight: takeoff to initial climb configuration; final approach to  touchdown  (or  low  approach);  LRE  to  MCE  (and  vice  versa)  handover  operations; medium  or  high  risk  test  point  execution,  and  terminal  attack  sequences  (maneuver-to-attack to weapons impact). A23.3.1.4.  Crews  will  maintain  a  sterile  environment  consistent  with  good  CRM procedures during all critical phases of flight or at PIC discretion. 284 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A23.3.1.5.  GCS  Entry  Procdeures.  GCS  Entry  is  at  PIC  discretion.  The  PIC  has  final authority  on  number  of  personnel  in  the  GCS.  The  PIC  can  designate  the  technician  to limit the nonessential personnel within the GCS. Technicians should post an access sign instructing  personnel  to  call  for  entry.    During  an  emergency  situation,  requested personnel  can  enter  the  rear  door  without  calling.  Exit  from  the  GCS  through  the  rear door.  If  no  rear  exit  is  available,  coordinate  with  the  PIC  prior  to  entering  or  exiting. Talking should be minimized and only if necessary for the execution of the mission in the GCS.  During all phases of flight there will be no entry or exit through the forward door, unless the GCS does not have an aft door. A23.3.1.6.  Aircrew  will  not  answer  pages  in  the  GCS  and  the  PA  system  should  be turned down in  volume.  The PA can be used to  perform communication as outlined in the appropriate airfield ground and flight operations procedures documents. A23.3.1.7.  Limitations/Restrictions.  While in the GCS, crewmembers will operate only those electronic items necessary for flight and/or mission operations. A23.3.1.8.  Landline  usage is authorized in the GCS while the RPA is in flight. The use of  personal  cell  phones  is  not  allowed  except  in  emergency  or  NORDO  situations  as authorized by the PIC.  If crewmembers are unable to answer the phone, a technician may answer and ask the crew if they are able to take the call. A23.3.1.9.  Smoking is prohibited in or within 50 feet of the GCS. A23.3.2.  Checklists. A23.3.2.1.  Aircrew  will  not  place  items  (checklists,  charts,  etc.)  behind  the  flap  lever, propeller control lever, throttle, or speed lever at any time. Aircrew will ensure no items interfere with aircraft controls or the Heads-Down Displays (HDD).  Items may be placed on the shelf above the HDD. A23.3.2.2.  Each  crewmember  will  reference  applicable  checklists  during  all  phases  of flight.    The  PIC  is  responsible  for  checklist  completion.    Electronic  checklists  are authorized for use however spare electronic or paper copy checklists must be available to each crewmember should failure of the primary checklist source occur. A23.3.2.3.  Aircrews  should  make  every  effort  to  avoid  non-essential  tasks  when  below 2,000 feet AGL. A23.3.2.4.  Approved  checklists  contained  within  AFTTP  3-1.Predator  and  AFTTP  3-3 Predator are authorized for use during weapons deliveries. A23.3.2.5.  Setting  up  a  GCS  for  another  crew  (also  referred  to  as  “running  presets”) shall  be  avoided  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.  Local  OG/CCs  may  authorize  a qualified  crew  other  than  the  gaining  handover  crew  to  execute  gaining  handover checklist  procedures  where  local  procedures  are  adopted  and  published  which  provide guidance to accomplish this practice safely. The gaining handover PIC is responsible for the  completion  of  all  checklists  necessary  to  gain  control  of  the  aircraft  regardless  of checklist items briefed as complete. A23.3.2.5.1.  Aircrews will advise the operations supervisor a GCS is being set up for a later crew. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 285 A23.3.3.  Required Equipment. A23.3.3.1.  Video Sources.  Two separate video sources are required for flight operations.  At least one nose camera, either EO or IR, must be available. A23.3.3.2.  INS/GPS A23.3.3.2.1.  Both  the  inertial  navigation  system  (INS)  and  global  positioning systems (GPS) must be operational. A23.3.3.3.  Transponder.    The  aircraft  shall  have  an  operable  transponder  with  altitude encoding  for  all  flights,  unless  the  PIC  has  contacted  the  controlling  facility  and  been given permission to fly without it.  The PIC should get the name and phone number of the individual at the controlling facility granting permission to fly the mission. A23.3.3.4.  Sensor  Equipment  at  Night.    A  minimum  of  one  IR  sensor  must  be operational for any mission with planned operations between the hours of official sunset and official sunrise. A23.3.3.5.  Data Recording.  GCS shall have HUD Video for each PSO with operational voice recording. A23.3.3.6.  Ground  Crew  Communication.    Two  way  communications  are  required between the pilot and ground crew during all ground operations and airborne operations that require ground crew participation. A23.3.4.  Engine Starts.  The engine will only be started on the command of the pilot and all engine starts require a fire guard. A23.3.5.  Taxi Operations. A23.3.5.1.  Maintain  safe  taxi  speeds  at  all  times.    Maximum  taxi  speed  is  10  knots ground speed on taxiways and 20 knots ground speed on runways.  Maximum taxi speed is 5 knots ground speed in turns. A23.3.5.2.  Do not taxi over arresting gear (i.e. BAK 9/12 or BAK-14). A23.3.5.3.  Prior to arm/de-arm, pilots will notify the ground crew that hands are clear of all aircraft controls. A23.3.5.4.  All  aircrew  will  abide  by  taxi  distances  and  restrictions  IAW  AFI  11-218, “Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground”, and will not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers unless exempted or waived. A23.3.5.5.  The  sensor  operator  will  use  the  MTS  to  ensure  the  aircraft  is  clear  of obstructions  during  taxi  operations.  The  sensor  operator  will  obtain  clearance  from  the pilot prior to releasing the MTS from position mode. A23.3.5.6.  If  the  pilot  is  only  using  the  MTS  to  taxi,  the  aircraft  will  be  brought  to  a complete stop before releasing the MTS from position mode. The MTS will be placed in position mode prior to resuming taxi. A23.3.5.7.  Pilots  will  exercise  caution  and  increase  following  distance  when  taxiing behind heavy or jet powered aircraft. 286 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A23.3.5.8.  Prior  to  unpinning/arming,  pilots  will  confirm  with  the  ground  crew  that hands and feet are clear of all aircraft controls and parking brake is set. A23.3.6.  Takeoff/Departure. A23.3.6.1.  For takeoff, the sensor operator will select a different HUD video source and camera from the one selected by the pilot. A23.3.6.2.  Do  not  takeoff,  land  or  accomplish  touch-and-go  landings  over  raised webbing-type  barriers  (e.g.,  MA-1A,  61QSII).    Pilots  may  takeoff,  land  or  accomplish touch-and-go  landings  before,  beyond  or  between  raised  cables  or  barriers  provided  the available distance meets minimum runway length requirements. A23.3.6.3.  Command  the  MTS  to  position  mode  whenever  below  500’  AGL.    Above 500’  AGL  and  with  pilot  concurrence,  the  sensor  operator  may  use  the  MTS  at  their discretion. A23.3.6.4.  Maintain an engine-out glideback capability to the maximum extent possible. A23.3.6.5.  For initial takeoffs on test sorties, with safety and test review board approval, the  available  runway  for  landing  must  exceed  total  planned  landing  distance  by  at  least 500  feet.    This  is  meant  to  apply  to  emergency  heavy  weight  landings  that  occur immediately  after  takeoff.    Attempt  to  dump  fuel  or  jettison  ordnance  to  reduce  gross weight  and  landing  distance.    In  all  other  cases,  landings  will  be  planned  so  that  the available runway exceeds landing distance by at least 1000 feet. A23.3.6.6.  The sensor operator will place the MTS in  position mode for takeoff. Flight graphics will be displayed on both PSO racks until at least 500 ft. AGL. A23.3.7.  Ops Checks. A23.3.7.1.  Accomplish  sufficient  ops  checks  to  ensure  safe  mission  execution.    Time between ops checks will not exceed one hour. A23.3.7.2.  Minimum items to check are: communication links, engine instruments, total fuel quantity and distribution, current feeding fuel tank, and aircraft weight. A23.3.8.  Enroute.    PICs  shall  maintain  normal  VFR/IFR  separation  utilizing  chase  aircraft and two way radio communications with a controlling agency.  If flying within the National Airspace  System  (NAS),  the  PIC  will  request  flight  following  from  ATC  as  much  as possible. A23.3.9.  Recovery.    The  normal  procedure  is  to  bring  the  RPA  into  visual  range  of  the ground  crew.    Once  the  aircraft  has  landed,  the  aircrew  may  clear  the  chase  aircraft  off  by stating “CLEARED OFF”.  Once cleared off, chase will either leave the area of operations or orbit south of the field and land after the runway is clear. A23.3.10.  Approach and Landing. A23.3.10.1.  Stabilized Approach.  Stabilized approach is defined as payload in position mode,  configured  for  landing,  normal  glidepath,  and  on  target  airspeed  (minus  5  KIAS and plus 15 KIAS).  Aircraft must be stabilized by 200 feet AGL.  If the aircraft becomes un-stabilized below 200 feet AGL, or if the following sink rate limits are exceeded, a go around is mandatory.  Sink rate limits:  1200 feet per minute (FPM) descent rate below AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 287 200 feet AGL and 800 FPM below 50 feet AGL.  Momentary deviations do not require a go around as long as immediate corrective actions are taken. A23.3.10.2.  The desired touchdown zone for a visual approach is 500 to 1500 feet from the threshold, or the glide path interception point for a precision approach.  When local procedures or unique runway surface conditions require landing beyond a given point on the  runway,  adjust  the  desired  touchdown  zone  accordingly  and  brief  applicable crewmembers. A23.3.10.3.  During a go-around or low approach, do not fly directly over aircraft on the runway at low altitude. A23.3.10.4.  Comply  with  the  wake  turbulence  avoidance  criteria  for  a  small  aircraft (category 1). A23.3.10.5.  Pilots will not practice EO nose-camera landings at night. A23.3.10.6.  The crewmember in the right seat will announce altitude deviations (plus or minus)  exceeding  100  feet  at  the  initial  approach  fix  and  the  final  approach  fix.    The crewmember  in  the  right  seat  will  announce  “DECISION  HEIGHT”  or  “MDA” (Minimum  Descent  Altitude)  when  reaching  these  altitudes  for  precision  and  non-precision approaches. A23.3.10.7.  For  MQ-9  landings  using  beta  range  (full  reverse),  the  pilot  will  call  “Full Reverse”  after  he  pulls  the  power  lever  into  reverse.    The  right  seat  crew  member  will call "Full Reverse" after he confirms the pilot’s action.  The right seat crew member will call ground speeds as the aircraft decelerates in 10 knot increments (60 kts, 50 kts, 40 kts, 30 kts) then call out the directive: "Ground Idle".  The pilot will call "Ground Idle" after moving the power lever to ground Idle.  The right seat crew member will again verify the pilot’s action. A23.3.10.8.  The MTS will be placed in position mode and flight  graphics displayed on both PSO racks prior to descending below 500 feet AGL. A23.3.10.9.  For  landing,  the  SO  will  select  a  different  HUD  video  source  and  camera from the one selected by the pilot. SO should confirm Payload position by checking VIT 11. A23.3.10.10.  If the MTS is the only available video source for landing, the SO will not conduct a non-uniformity correction (NUC) of the MTS on final approach without prior coordination with the PIC.  If the MTS is not suitable for landing below 1,500 feel AGL on final  approach,  and no other video sources  are available, the crew must  initiate a go around. A23.3.10.11.  Aircraft returning to base with unexpended free-fall live ordnance will fly a straight-in  approach  to  a  full  stop,  unless  operational  requirements  dictate  otherwise.  Pattern  work,  to  include  touch  and  go’s  are  authorized  with  unexpended  inert  free-fall and “pinned” training munitions. A23.3.10.12.  Above Maximum  Allowable Gross Weight  (MAGW) Operations.  Above MAGW  operations  may  require  an  OG/CC  waiver.  (Expections:  Emergancy,  part  of Approved Test Card/Plan). 288 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A23.3.11.  Chase Operations. A23.3.11.1.  Chase  Crew  Requirements.    Two  pilots  are  required  for  night  chase operations.  The safety pilot (pilot not flying) is responsible for clearing for traffic while the pilot flying is responsible for maintaining aircraft control and visual separation with the RPA.  Two pilots are also required when oxygen is required by FAA regulations.  A single pilot may be used in day chase missions. A23.3.11.2.  It is the chase aircraft’s responsibility to advise the RPA aircrew if the flight path  indicates  a  possible  conflict  with  other  aircraft  or  weather.    Two-way  radio communication will be maintained between the chase aircraft and the RPA.  If there has been no communication between the chase aircraft and the RPA in the last 15 minutes, a radio check between the two aircraft will be accomplished. A23.3.11.3.  Weather  Minimums.    Chase  operations  will  be  conducted  in  VMC.    For rejoins  underneath  a  ceiling,  minimum  ceiling/visibility  criteria  are  1000  feet/3  NM  for day, 3000 feet/3 NM for night. A23.3.11.4.  Altitude Minimums.  Chase aircraft will not go below 500 feet AGL during chase  procedures  in  day/VMC  conditions.    Chase  aircraft  will  not  go  below  minimum safe altitude (MSA) during chase procedures at night.  MSA is defined as 1000 feet above the  highest  obstacle  in  the  defined  testing/training  area  and  will  be  briefed  on  every mission. (Recommend the MSA be based on a 5 NM radius from the RPA.) A23.3.11.5.  Distance  Minimums.   Chase  aircraft  will  maintain  300  feet  to  1500  feet  of separation from the RPA.  Chase aircraft should maintain a slight stack and 2 to 5 aspect on the RPA. A23.3.11.6.  Equipment  Procedures.    The  chase  aircraft  and  the  RPA  will  have  their beacons  and  strobe  lights  on  during  daylight  operations  to  increase  visibility  for  other aircraft. A23.3.11.7.  The  RPA  will  squawk  the  transponder  code  for  the  formation.    The  chase aircraft  will  squawk  standby  and  be  ready  to  squawk  for  the  formation  in  the  event  the RPA’s transponder fails. A23.3.11.8.  The  chase  crew  will  call  “READY  FOR  REJOIN”  when  in  position  and visual  the  RPA.    Additionally,  the  chase  crew  will  report  all  gear  up  and  gear  down positions. A23.3.11.9.  The  RPA  will  call  all  turns  at  night  or  in  close  formation,  as  well  as  all altitude and airspeed changes. A23.3.12.  Lost Communication. A23.3.12.1.  RPA  Lost  Communication.    If  the  chase  aircraft  detects  the  RPA  is  lost comm, the chase crew will contact the RPA ops desk and direct the RPA to recover to the local  area.    If  the  RPA  does  not  recover,  chase  crew  will  provide  ATC  with  the  actual position and probable destination of the RPA.  If the chase aircraft cannot safely continue to execute chase responsibilities (maintain VMC, chase low on fuel, a potential threat of a collision  exists,  etc.),  the  chase  aircraft  will  proceed  to  and  loiter,  well  clear  of  the landing  runway.    If  radio  communications  are  regained,  chase  aircraft  will  request  to rejoin.  Otherwise, the chase aircraft will return to base (RTB). AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 289 A23.3.12.2.  Chase  Aircraft  Lost  Communication. communication failure with the chase aircraft, the RPA crew will RTB.   If  the  RPA  crew  detects  a A23.3.13.  Loss  of  Visual  Contact.    If  the  chase  aircraft  loses  visual  contact  with  the  RPA, immediate separation is essential.  Upon losing sight of the RPA, the chase aircraft will call “BLIND”  with  altitude  over  the  radio.    The  RPA  will  acknowledge  the  blind  call  and immediately transmit heading, altitude, and airspeed.  The RPA will remain predictable and continue its current flight path unless directed otherwise.  The sensor operator will utilize the MTS  (if  available)  in  an  attempt  to  clear  the  RPA  flight  path  and  avoid  a  collision.    The chase  aircraft  will  obtain  a  minimum  of  500  feet  altitude  separation  until  visual  contact  is regained.    If  visual  contact  is  lost  for  more  than  30  seconds,  chase  aircraft  will  request assistance  from  ATC  to  reacquire  the  visual.  While  the  chase  aircraft  is  visually  searching, the RPA will make position reports and call turns. A23.3.14.  Encountering  IMC.    The  chase  aircraft  should  be  directive  to  avoid  IMC penetration;  however,  if  an  inadvertent  IMC  penetration  occurs  resulting  in  loss  of  visual, immediate  separation  from  the  RPA  is  essential.    Smooth  application  of  control  inputs  is imperative  to  minimize  the  effects  of  spatial  disorientation.    The  chase  aircraft  will simultaneously transition to instruments, maneuver away from the last known RPA position, and call “BLIND, POPEYE” over the radio.   The RPA aircrew will acknowledge the blind call  and  immediately  transmit  heading,  altitude,  and  airspeed.    The  RPA  will  remain predictable  and  maintain  its  current  flight  path  unless  directed  otherwise.    The  sensor operator will utilize the MTS (if available) to clear the RPA’s flight path.  The chase aircraft will  obtain  a  minimum  of  500  feet  altitude  separation  until  visual  contact  is  regained.    If visual  contact  is  lost  for  more  than  30  seconds,  chase  aircraft  will  request  assistance  from ATC to reacquire the visual. While the chase aircraft is visually searching, the RPA aircrew will  make  position  reports  and  call  turns.    The  chase  aircraft  and  the  RPA  will  coordinate separate ATC clearances to ensure separation with each other as well as other aircraft (IFR clearance, squawk, etc).  Once clear of IMC and visual the chase aircraft will request rejoin with the RPA. A23.3.15.  Chase Rejoins. A23.3.15.1.  Takeoff.    This  is  the  preferred  method  of  rejoin.    Chase  aircraft  will normally  takeoff  prior  to  the  RPA,  loiter  south  of  the  field  and  call  “READY  FOR REJOIN”  on  the  Common  Traffic  Advisory  Frequency  (CTAF)  or  other  pre-briefed frequency.    The  RPA  aircrew  will  announce  takeoff  on  the  CTAF.  Chase  aircraft  will keep the RPA in sight, climb with it, and plan to rejoin by 2000 feet AGL.  Chase aircraft will not go below final approach speed during rejoin. A23.3.15.2.  In-flight. If the RPA is airborne prior to the chase aircraft’s arrival, the chase aircraft will remain south of the runway environment  until visual.  The RPA will assist the rejoin by stating the RPA’s location, heading, airspeed and altitude.  Once visual, the chase aircraft will request to rejoin. A23.4.  Instrument Procedures. A23.4.1.  The MQ-9 is an approach category B aircraft. A23.4.2.  Weather Minimums, Restrictions, and Planning Factors.  The MQ-9 are turbulence  category IV aircraft. 290 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A23.4.2.1.  All flights shall be conducted under VFR conditions throughout the planned route of flight (1500 feet ceiling,  3 SM visibility, +/- 1 hr ETA).  Pilots will maneuver the  aircraft  so  as  to  maintain  appropriate  VFR  cloud  clearances  during  departure,  en-route, and recovery IAW AFI 11-202V3. A23.4.2.2.  Operating  with  ceiling  and/or  visibility  below  VFR  minimums  requires  a published  airport  surveillance  radar  or  precision  approach  radar  terminal  approach procedure  at  the  operating  airfield.    The  INS/GPS  is  not  certified  for  flying  GPS instrument approaches. A23.4.2.3.  Normally,  declaring  an  alternate  airfield  is  not  an  available  option  for  the MQ-9 unless the airfield has a pre-positioned GCS (or LRGCS).  If a pre-positioned GCS is available, use published alternate weather requirements IAW AFI 11-202V3.  Holding (instead of an alternate airport) is authorized for RPA operations.  While airborne, if the actual  weather  deteriorates  below  1500  feet  ceiling  or  the  visibility  is  below  3  SM, crewmembers  will  increase  recovery  fuel  to  allow  the  aircraft  to  hold  for  at  least  one hour, in addition to, normal recovery fuel. A23.4.2.4.  When  the  ceiling  is  below  3,000  feet  or  the  visibility  is  below  3  miles, crewmembers will increase recovery fuel to allow the aircraft to hold for a minimum of two  hours  at  best  endurance,  then  penetrate  and  land  with  normal  recovery  fuel.  This visibility requirement does not  apply if the MTS  IR camera is  operable and visibility is below minimums due to sand/dust. A23.4.2.5.  While  airborne,  if  the  actual  weather  deteriorates  below  forecasted  and  is below  the  minima  specified  at  the  actual  time  of  arrival,  pilots  are  authorized  to  fly  to pilot  weather  category  or  published  approach  minimums,  whichever  is  higher,  if necessary to recover the aircraft. A23.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A23.5.1.  Wind. A23.5.1.1.  Actual  winds  must  be  within  flight  manual  limits  at  takeoff  and  landing.  Forecast winds must be within flight manual limits at ETA (±1 hour). A23.5.1.2.  While  airborne,  if  revised  forecast  winds  for  ETA  (±1  hour)  exceed  limits specified in the flight manual, the pilot will terminate the mission in time to return to the operating  base  before  the  forecast  time  of  increased  winds,  or  terminate  the  mission  in time  to  return  to  the  operating  base  with  sufficient  fuel  to  fly  low  approaches  for  a minimum of two hours (or as directed by Local Operating Procedures) unless a suitable alternate is available. A23.5.1.3.  If  sufficient  fuel  remains  and  mission  allows,  the  pilot  may  establish  a  new ETA to overfly the forecast period of increased winds.  The fuel requirements specified in Table 2.1 must be complied with for any updated ETA. A23.5.2.  Turbulance: Aircrews will not takeoff if forecast or reported severe turbulence for Light/Category I aircraft is present along the route of flight. A23.5.3.  Thunderstorms  and  Lightning.    Lightning  strikes  and  electrostatic  discharges  can occur  in  what  may  look  like  bening  conditions.    All  flight  and  ground  operations  are prohibited  when  lightning  is  reported  within  five  (5)  nautical  miles  of  the  airfield.    All AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 291 ground  operations  are  prohibited  if  thunderstorms  are  producing  hazardous  conditions  such as hail, strong winds above 30 knots, heavy rain or lightning. A23.5.3.1.  The  PIC  will  not  operate  the  aircraft  within  25  NM  of  known  thunderstorm activity. A23.5.4.  Cold-Weather  Operating  Procedures.    Do  not  takeoff  with  frost,  ice  or  snow accumulation  on  the  wings.    Whenever  the  outside  air  temperature  is  less  than  40  degrees Fahrenheit  or  the  pilot  is  concerned  about  frost,  ice  or  snow,  apply  an  ice  retardant  to  the wings  or  inspect  the  aircraft  for  frost  immediately  prior  to  takeoff.    Pilots  should  avoid penetration of visible moisture or precipitation to the maximum extent possible, particularly above the freezing level.  If precipitation cannot be avoided, pilots should maximize climb or descent rate to exit potential or actual icing conditions. A23.5.4.1.  Icing Procedures.  Do not conduct flight into forecast icing greater than light.  Do not  conduct  flight  into known icing conditions.    If encountering icing in  flight,  take action to exit icing conditions immediately. A23.5.5.  Runway/Taxiway  Conditions.    Units  will  specify  minimum  runway  condition reading (RCR) for taxi operations. Do not takeoff or land with an RCR less than 12 (waiver authority  is  OG/CC).  When  no  RCR  is  available,  refer  to  International  Civil  Aviation Organization  conversions  in  the  Flight  Information  Handbook.    Handling  characteristics  of the MQ-9 on ice or snow are not optimum.  Minimize power settings to limit taxi speed to no more  than  5  KGS.    If  required  to  stop,  try  to  stop  over  clear  portions  of  the  taxiway.    The pilot will remain focused on the outside video display at all times. A23.6.  Air-To-Surface Operations. A23.6.1.  Live/Heavyweight Ordnance Procedures. A23.6.1.1.  IMC Weapons Deliveries.  Pilots may release live or inert weapons in or thru IMC  IAW  the  following  procedures,  unless  restricted  by  range  procedures  or  theater ROE (verification requirements against known target coordinates only applies to training sorties): A23.6.1.1.1.  Ballistic  Ordnance  releases.  Verify  stores  management  system  (SMS) target  coordinates  against  known  target  coordinates  prior  to  release  and  ensure weather minimums will allow for minimum of 8 seconds of available guidance time from buddy lase platform and/or ground party lasing the target. A23.6.1.1.2.  Inertially  Aided  Munitions  (IAM).  Verify  SMS  target  coordinates against known target coordinates prior to release. A23.6.1.1.2.1.  SAR  derived  KAATS  target  coordinates  may  be  used.    For training,  verify    the  final  KAATS  derived  coordinates  against  known  target coordinates prior to release if available. A23.6.1.2.  Inertial  Aided  Munitions  (IAM)  Bomb  on-coordinate  release  /  Coordinate only  releases:    Before  releasing  live  or  inert  IAMs  in  a  bomb-on-coordinate  mode  or employing any ordnance in a system delivery mode using coordinates only (i.e. manually created  target)  verify  Navigation  system  accuracy  within  15  minutes  of  release  by confirming GPS Figure of Merit (FOM) less than or equal to 5. 292 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A23.6.2.  Procedures for carrying live or inert GBU 12/38 ordnance.  Procedures for carrying live  or  inert  GBU  12/38  ordnance  in  conjunction  with  cocked  Linear  Electromechanical Actuators  (LEMAs)  on  empty  stations.        WARNING:  There  is  no  overt  indication  on  the pilot heads-up display (HUD) or stores management system (SMS) screens that differentiate between live, inert, or simulated GBU 12/38 ordnance to include empty stations with cocked LEMAs. To prevent inadvertent selection and release of live or inert ordnance, aircrew will adhere to the following procedures: A23.6.2.1.  If  live  or  inert  GBU  12/38  ordnance  is  being  carried  in  conjunction  with  a cocked LEMA on any empty station, live or inert weapons must be loaded on the inboard stations  first.  Cocked  LEMAs  will  be  configured  primarily  on  outboard  stations.  If  a single live or inert weapon is carried, it will be loaded on station 5, and LEMAs may be cocked  on  all  empty  stations  (including  station  3).  If  three  lives  or  inerts  are  carried, station  2  will  be  used  to  load  the  outboard  live/inert,  and  station  6  will  be  used  for  the cocked LEMA. A23.6.2.2.  All dry attacks will be conducted with the cocked LEMA if available. At no time will crews select  the live or inert  inboard stations until  ready to  release the live or inert ordnance. A23.6.2.3.  The  cocked  LEMA  station(s)  will  not  be  activated  (“fired”)  until  all  live  or inert  ordnance  has  been  visually  confirmed  released  with  the  Multi-Spectral  Targeting System (MTS). A23.6.3.  Master Arm switch.  When carrying releasable ordnance, configure IAW 11-214. A23.6.3.1.  The use of Master Arm and release switches is authorized when not carrying releasable  ordnance.    When  carrying  releasable  ordnance,  remain  two  switch  positions away from release at all times prior to intentionally releasing live or inert ordnance. The two deselected switches will be the master arm switch and the trigger. A23.6.4.  Crews  will  perform  battle  damage  and  weapons  checks  prior  to  or  during  RTB.  This check is mandatory following expenditure of live ordnance.  If unable to complete the check  using  organic  sensors,  request  support  from  the  chase  aircraft  or  a  ground  observer before landing. A23.7.  Abnormal Procedures A23.7.1.  Ground Emergencies. A23.7.1.1.  Pilots  will  not  taxi  with  nose-wheel  steering,  brake  system,  video  path,  or telemetry/datalink malfunctions. A23.7.1.2.  In  the  event  of  an  inadvertent  entry  onto  soft  or  unprepared  surfaces,  pilots will  not  attempt  to  recover  the  aircraft  to  the  prepared  surface  by  using  engine  power and/or differential braking. A23.7.2.  In-flight Emergencies. A23.7.2.1.  Air Aborts.  Abort the mission, regardless of apparent damage or subsequent normal operation, if any of the following occur: bird strike, Over-G, flight control system anomalies (including uncommanded flight control inputs), or engine failure. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 293 A23.7.2.2.  Landing Gear Malfunctions.  If encountering a landing gear malfunction and the gear are down, leave them down and do not make touch and go landings. A23.7.2.3.  Forced  Landing.    Comply  with  forced  landing  procedures  in  the  flight manual.  If  a  Ku-band  forced  landing  to  a  runway  or  primary  site  cannot  be  completed without  endangering  personnel  or  property  on  the  ground,  then  another  site  will  be selected even if attempting a landing at that alternate site may result in destruction of the aircraft. A23.7.3.  Emergency Mission Planning.  Maintain awareness of current and forecast weather along the planned and emergency mission routes of flight, and at the intended landing field.  Update  the  emergency  mission  route  for  weather  hazards  (e.g.,  cloud  layers,  icing, turbulence,  etc.)  throughout  the  flight.    Alter  the  route,  if  necessary,  and  use  care  to  select appropriate aircraft parameters to avoid hazardous weather conditions.  294 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 Attachment 24 PC-12/U-28 (AND VARIANTS) OPERATING PROCEDURES A24.1.

Take-off/Landing Procedures. A24.3.4.1.  Only qualified U-28/PC-12 pilots will conduct the takeoff and landing unless the  other  pilot  is  a  U-28/PC-12  instructor.    Either  pilot  can  taxi  the  airplane  onto  the runway for take-off. A24.3.4.2.  Crosswind for Takeoff and Landings. Table A24.2 will be used to determine the recommended maximum crosswind component for takeoffs or landings.  The pilot’s operating  handbook  does  not  introduce  RCR  into  performance  factors  for  takeoff  or landing. Table A24.2.  Maximum Crosswind Component. A24.3.5.  Touch-and-Go/Stop-and-go Landings.  296 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A24.3.5.1.  Conduct  touch  and  go  operations  IAW  the  PC-12/U-28  Checklists.  Touch-and-Go operations require two qualified pilots or an IP if the other pilot is unqualified or non-current. A24.3.5.2.  The  Touch-and-Go  Checklists  may  be  used  when  performing  multiple instrument  approaches  or  VFR  pattern  practice  at  the  same  airport  or  transitioning  to another  airport  within  25  NM.  Pilots  will  complete  the  Climb,  Cruise,  Descent,  and Before  Landing  Checklists  after  the  initial  takeoff  or  if  transiting  to  another  airfield greater than 25 NM from the airport where instrument-approach or VFR-pattern practice was accomplished. A24.3.5.3.  When  the  runway  surface  is  reported  as  wet  and  crosswinds  exceed  75%  of the  maximum  demonstrated  crosswinds  listed  in  the  Pilot  Operating  Handbook  (POH), Stop-and-Go or Touch-and-Go operations are prohibited. A24.3.5.4.  Stop-and-Go  or  Touch-and-Go  operations  are  prohibited  on  icy  or  snow-polluted runways. A24.3.6.  Minimum  runway  length  for  touch  and  go  operations  is  5,000  feet  for  full  and partial flap landings and 6,000 feet for no-flap landings. A24.3.7.  Stop  and  go  landings  are  authorized  if  the  Accelerate-Stop  Distance  is  less  than 80%  of  usable  runway  available.    Stop-and-go  landings  will  not  be  accomplished  unless  a minimum of 2400 RVR, or ½ SM mile (if RVR is unavailable) and useable runway length is not less than 80% of Accelerate-Stop distance. A24.3.8.  Touch-and-Go Landings are authorized when ceiling and visibility range are better than 300 and ¾. A24.3.9.  Aircraft  Loading/Cargo  Handling.      Ensure  a  weight  and  balance  computation  is accomplished  prior  to  each  flight.    Use  of  spreadsheet  products  is  acceptable,  provided  all weights and moments are properly accounted for by flight station. A24.3.10.  Taxi.  All aircraft doors will be closed during taxi operations. A24.3.11.  Flap Setting.  Takeoff flap setting will be 15 degrees.  Takeoff flap setting of 30 degrees is permissible, provided the procedure is briefed by the pilot. A24.3.12.  Oxygen  Requirements.    Oxygen  will  be  used  as  prescribed  in  AFI  11-202V3  or the flight manual, whichever is more restrictive. A24.3.13.  Communications. A24.3.13.1.  Sterile  Cockpit.  Limit  conversation  to  that  essential  for  crew  coordination and mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and any flight below 10,000 feet MSL (except cruise). A24.3.13.2.  Aircraft  Interphone.  Primary  crewmembers  will  monitor  interphone  during critical  phases  of  flight.  Crewmembers  will  advise  the  aircraft  commander  prior  to checking off interphone. A24.3.13.3.  Command Radios. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 297 A24.3.13.3.1.  The  pilot  not  flying  the  aircraft  normally  makes  all  air  traffic  control (ATC) radio calls.  During periods of high tasking it is acceptable for the pilot flying the aircraft to assume ATC radio duties. A24.3.13.3.2.  The  pilot  operating  the  radios  will  announce  which  radio  is  primary, and will inform the crew when the primary radio changes. A24.3.13.3.3.  One  pilot  will  record  and  acknowledge  all  ATC  clearances.  Another crewmember should monitor the read back and ensure compliance. A24.3.13.3.4.  Both pilots will monitor UHF guard (or VHF guard when appropriate) regardless of primary radio. A24.3.14.  Functional  Check  Flights.      For  initial  takeoff  weather  minimums  during FCF/ACF operations, PC-12 aircrews will use the fighter, attack, trainer, and U-2 guidance regarding weather found in Table 3.1. A24.4.  Instrument Procedures. A24.4.1.  The U-28/PC-12 is approach category B. The pilot may fly circling approaches at higher speeds raising the circling minimums  to the category for the speed  to  be flown. The PF  is  responsible  for  briefing  speeds  and  flying  the  approach  according  to  the  correct minimums. A24.4.2.  During night or marginal weather, fly a precision approach, if available. If a PAR or  ILS  is  not  available,  fly  any  available  approved  instrument  approach.  On  training  and evaluation flights, or flights at familiar airfields, pilots may fly non-precision approaches or VFR patterns to accomplish required training or evaluation requirements. A24.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A24.5.1.  Maximum Gross Weights. Operating weights will be in accordance with the flight manual (and supplements) weight, altitude, and temperature limits. A24.5.2.  Flight  Duty  Period.  Observe  restrictions  and  guidance  of  AFI  11-202V3  and AFMC  Sup  1  for  transport  type  aircraft.  In  addition  to  the  restrictions  for  FDP  in  AFI  11-202V3,  limit  crew  duty  day  to  12  hours  with  an  inoperative  autopilot  even  if  a  second qualified U-28/PC-12 pilot is available.  If the autopilot fails after departure, continue to the next scheduled stop and then comply with the 12-hour duty day limitation. A24.5.3.  Survival/Aircrew Flight Equipment Requirements. A24.5.3.1.  On  missions  carrying  passengers,  ensure  oxygen  masks  are  available  for  all occupants regardless of planned flight altitude. A24.5.3.2.  A minimum One first aid kit should be onboard the aircraft at all times. A24.5.4.  Air Work A24.5.4.1.  Descent.  Prior  to  descent  into  unfamiliar  areas,  appropriate  terrain  charts (Operational  Navigation  Chart  (ONC),  Sectional  Aeronautical  Chart,  Tactical  Pilotage Chart (TPC), or Joint Operations Graphic (JOG)) should be reviewed to increase aircrew situational  awareness  of  obstructions.  Primary  crewmembers  will  not  be  involved  in duties  other  than  aircraft  operations,  descent  and  approach  monitoring,  and  required checklist items from the initial descent point to landing. 298 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A24.5.4.2.  Unusual attitudes, stalls, steep turns, and flight  at minimum control airspeed will be accomplished clear of clouds and at or above 5,000 feet AGL. A24.5.4.3.  Steep  turns  will  be  limited  to  60  degrees  of  bank  during  level  flight  in  day, VMC;  otherwise,  bank  is  limited  to  45  degrees.  Review  stall  speeds  before accomplishing. A24.5.4.4.  Traffic  Pattern  Stall  Series  requires  day  VMC  at  a  minimum  of  5000  feet AGL or 5000 feet above cloud deck. A24.5.5.  Practice/Simulated Emergencies. A24.5.5.1.  Practice/simulated  emergencies  will  not  be  accomplished  with  passengers onboard.  Emergency  procedures,  which  require  placing  switches  in  other  than  their normal  positions  or  placing  the  aircraft  in  an  abnormal  configuration,  may  only  be accomplished during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner is in one of the pilot seats.  Instructor pilot candidates who occupy a pilot seat and are under the supervision of a flight examiner pilot (not in a pilot seat) may practice simulated  emergency  procedures  during  initial  or  re-qualification  upgrade  evaluations. Preface  all  simulated  emergencies  with  the  word  “simulated”  and  terminate  simulated emergencies when an actual emergency arises. A24.5.5.2.  Simulated  engine-out.    Simulated  engine-out  maneuvers  will  only  be accomplished near a suitable landing area. A24.5.5.3.  Simulated  Forced  Landings.  Simulated  forced  landings  outside  the  airfield environment due to simulated engine malfunction/failure and other emergencies will only be  accomplished  in  VMC  under  VFR.  The  IP  will  initiate  the  simulated  emergency  to practice  a  forced  landing  only  in  an  area  previously  studied  by  the  IP  for  hazards  and obstacles. The  IP will terminate the simulated forced landing and direct  a go-around no lower than 100 feet AGL. A24.5.5.4.  Practice engine shut-downs will not be accomplished. A24.5.6.  Aircraft Equipment A24.5.6.1.  A fully mission capable aircraft is the ultimate objective of the maintenance effort. The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission rests with the aircraft commander. If one aircraft commander accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that aircraft commander,  or  a  different  aircraft  commander,  to  subsequent  operations  with  the  same item  or  system  inoperative.  When  the  aircraft  commander  considers  an  item  essential, designate  the  component  mission  essential  (ME)  on  the  AFTO  Form  781  (or  user equivalent), and the item will be repaired or replaced prior to departure. A24.5.6.2.  Engine  performance,  aircraft  attitude,  vertical  velocity  indications,  altitude, airspeed,  and  heading  instruments  should  be  operative  in  both  pilot  positions.  For instruments with both analog and digital displays, as a minimum the analog portion must be operational.  AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 299 Attachment 25 RQ-4 OPERATING PROCEDURES A25.1.  General Information.  This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives, outlines  procedures  for  operation  of  the  RQ-4  aircraft  under  most  circumstances.    AF  and contractor  aircrews  and  all  management  levels  concerned  with  operation  of  all  RQ-4  aircraft must  comply  with  the  outlined  requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this attachment.    Operations  or  procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished  if  they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment. A25.1.1.  Phase  Manuals.    Phase  manuals  are  "how  to"  documents  that  expand  on  basic procedures in flight manuals and applicable USAF instructions.  Training units may develop these  manuals  from  procedures  contained  in  relevant  documents  to  enhance  volume  and provide  student  crewmembers  with  explanatory  study  material.  Phase  manuals  will  not  be less restrictive than flight manuals and applicable USAF instructions.  Operational units may use phase manuals to augment mission qualification and continuation training. A25.1.2.  Crew. The crew is defined as personnel responsible for safe operation of the RQ-4 aircraft.  For the RQ-4, the term pilot refers to a pilot in the LRE or MCE or to the Mission Commander (MC). A25.1.2.1.  Minimum Crew: Common Ground Station (CGS):  Pilot (MCE/LRE/MC) A25.1.2.2.  The  MC  is  responsible  for  the  smooth  conduct  of  the  mission  including  air vehicle  routing,  collection  objectives,  and  crew  duties.    Though  not  always  directly controlling  the  aircraft,  the  MC  is  the  Pilot  In  Command  (PIC)  with  the  authority  and responsibilities outlined in AFI 11-202V3.  The MC is the final authority on mission and flight issues.  The MC should maximize the mission objectives while maintaining safety of flight. A25.1.2.2.1.  For  all  ground  and  flight  operations,  at  least  one  pilot  will  occupy  the controlling shelter at all times.  Normally, two pilots will be scheduled for each shift of a long mission allowing each to take breaks. A25.1.2.3.  The SO is responsible for mission collection planning and management. The SO  is  responsible  for  monitoring  image  quality,  controlling  the  automatic  or  manual imagery  dissemination,  and  assisting  the  pilot  as  required  with  checklists  and  available crew aids. A25.1.2.4.  The  Hawkeye  is  responsible  for  executing  the  pilot’s  aircraft  exterior inspection;  verifying  the  aircraft  is  properly  configured  for  each  phase  of  ground movement, takeoff, and landing; visually clearing appropriate taxiways and runway areas prior to and during taxi, takeoff, and landing operations; alerting the PIC of any required corrective  action;  and  maintaining  constant  communications  with  the  PIC  in  order  to maintain safe ground operations prior to launch and after landing until engine shut down and ground safety pin insertion. A25.2.  Mission Planning. A25.2.1.  Responsibilities. 300 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A25.2.1.1.  Mission Commanders (MC). The MC is responsible for mission planning and briefing.    Mission  planning  and  mission  briefing  are  two  separate  activities.    The  MCs and  mission  planners  will  jointly  review  mission  plans  to  ensure  mission  effectiveness and safety if a mission planner is available. (mission planner may not be on-site at FOLs). A25.2.1.2.  Commanders  will  ensure  currency  of  all  mission  planning  materials  and compliance  with  command  guidance.    Squadron  and  Forward  Operating  Location operations officers will schedule adequate mission planning time prior to flight. A25.2.1.3.  Crewmembers  other  than  the  crew  flying  the  mission  may  accomplish mission  planning.    If  operationally  necessary,  mission  elements  and  events  may  be modified  the  day  of  the  flight  or  while  the  RQ-4  is  airborne  as  long  as  changes  do  not compromise  flight  safety.    The  MC  will  ensure  all  crewmembers  acknowledge  any changes. A25.2.1.4.  Complete sufficient mission planning to ensure safe mission accomplishment.  Areas  covered  will  include,  at  a  minimum,  fuel  requirements,  takeoff  and  landing  data (when  applicable),  mission  objectives,  threat  study  (when  applicable),  departure/arrival procedures  including  thorough  contingency  route  planning,  communication  plan,  and collection plan.  The use of RQ-4 certified departures and arrivals ensure safe margins for varying  conditions  including  winds,  wet  runway,  aircraft  weight,  Differential  Global Positioning System (DGPS) tolerances, etc.  This does not relieve the MC of ensuring a safe  mission  plan  for  current  conditions.    Any  additional  risks  must  be  briefed  and elevated to the appropriate authority for approval if required. A25.2.2.  Mission Materials. A25.2.2.1.  Mission  Plan.    The  mission  plan  is  created  entirely  in  AFMSS  or  JMPS, consisting of Navigation route, collection plan, communications plan, and other required files. A25.2.2.2.  Mission  Materials.    AFMSS  and  JMPS  systems  produce  products  to  aid  the crew  in  mission  monitoring.    Products  may  include  electronic  or  paper  copies  of  flight plan, sensor plan, action points, screen capture charts showing the route in various scales, etc.    Units  will  standardize  the  mission  materials  package  to  allow  for  maximum situational awareness and flexibility to the pilot and cover all possible contingencies.  A copy  of the Flight  Operators Manual  and associated directives will be  available in  each ground shelter. A25.2.3.  Briefing/Debriefing. A25.2.3.1.  Briefing  Guides.  Briefing  guides  provide  the  briefer  with  a  reference  list  of items  that  may  apply  to  particular  missions.    The  briefer  should  cover  only  mission essential  information.    Those  items  understood  by  all  participants  may  be  briefed  as "standard.”  Reference 452 FLTS OI 11-1RQ for squadron specific briefing guides. A25.2.3.2.  Mission Brief (or T-1 Brief).  The MC will brief all crew members to ensure safe and effective mission accomplishment.  Use the following procedures for all mission briefings: A25.2.3.2.1.  All  crewmembers  scheduled  to  support  the  mission  will  attend  the briefing.    Students  in  combined  Initial  Qualification  Training  (IQT)/Mission AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 301 Qualification  Training  (MQT)  and  crewmembers  who  are  logging  individual  events for  currency  do  not  need  to  attend  the  mission  briefing  provided  they  are  under  the supervision of an instructor who attended the briefing; however, they must receive a changeover  brief  in  their  respective  crew  position  before  participating  in  the  flight.  Other  crewmembers  who  did  not  attend  a  mission  briefing  must  obtain  Squadron Operations Officer  (SQ/DO)  approval prior to participating  in  a flight.    The pilot  in command  or  MC  will  ensure  crewmembers  participating  in  a  flight  under  SQ/DO approval are adequately briefed prior to assuming crew duties. A25.2.3.2.2.  Brief  any  manual  pilot  interventions  in  the  case  of  contingencies  not autonomously handled by the AV (if applicable). A25.2.3.2.3.  Mission  elements  and  events  may  be  modified  and  briefed  while  the RQ-4  is  airborne  as  long  as  changes  do  not  compromise  flight  safety.    Do  not  fly unbriefed  missions  and/or  events.    The  pilot  or  MC  will  ensure  all  crewmembers acknowledge all changes. A25.2.3.2.4.  Changeover  Briefs. changeover brief for each crew position changeover.   Individual  crewmembers  will  complete  a A25.2.3.2.5.  Mission Debrief.  After changeover or landing, debrief all missions as a crew. A25.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A25.3.1.  Common Ground Station (CGS). A25.3.1.1.  The  MC  is  the  approval  authority  for  visitor  seating  in  the  CGS.    Only qualified pilots or students in a formal course of training and under instructor supervision may fly the RQ-4. A25.3.1.2.  Ensure the RQ-4 is not in a critical phase of flight before entering the CGS.  While the RQ-4 is airborne, all personnel will limit extraneous conversations. A25.3.1.3.  Place no items (checklists, charts, etc.) on the keyboards or on the mouse at any time during ground or flight operations. A25.3.1.4.  The  MC  will  ensure  the  CGS  is  clean  and  orderly  after  a  mission.    All crewmembers  are  responsible  for  personal  and  professional  items  prior  to  departing  the CGS. A25.3.1.5.  The  MC  will  ensure  removal  of  all  classified  material  from  the  CGS  upon mission completion. A25.3.1.6.  Smoking is prohibited in or within 50 feet of the CGS. A25.3.1.7.  Crewmembers will take appropriate unclassified logs to mission debrief. A25.3.1.8.  Crewmembers will operate in the CGS only those electronic items necessary for flight and/or mission operations. A25.3.2.  Communications.    Crewmembers  will  use  the  following  crew  positions  for intercom  identification  and  call  up:  “MC,”  “pilot,”  “SO,”  “CX,”  and  “QC”  for  the  shelter.  Call  sign  for  the  Vehicle  Test  Controller  (VTC)  is  “VTC.”    Do  not  discuss  classified information when making radio transmissions. 302 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A25.3.2.1.  Ground Communications. A25.3.2.1.1.  The pilot and ground crew will maintain good communication during all ground checks and anytime the aircraft's engine is operating on the ground. A25.3.2.1.2.  VTC  operator  will  maintain  communication  with  the  pilot  as  per checklist procedures A25.3.2.2.  In-flight Communications. A25.3.2.2.1.  Limit intercom communications to flight critical information from start of “Before Starting Engine” checklist until completion of “After Takeoff and Climb” checklist and from initiation of “Descent and Landing” checklist until completion of “Shutdown”  checklist.  During  critical  phases  of  flight,  keep  a  sterile  environment consistent with good CRM procedures.  Critical phases of flight are taxi, takeoff and departure up to safe altitude, arrival and landing, taxi back, shutdown, and any other time determined by the pilot in command. A25.3.2.2.2.  Limit telephone calls to the CGS to time-critical flight related items. A25.3.2.2.3.  Pilots  flying  the  aircraft  should  not  use  the  telephone  during  a  critical phase of flight unless absolutely necessary for safe operations. A25.3.2.2.4.  All  crewmembers  will  monitor  the  intercom  to  the  maximum  extent possible and advise the pilot prior to going off intercom and will announce when back on intercom. A25.3.3.  Checklists.    Each  pilot  will  have  and  refer  to  appropriate  checklists  during  flight operations to ensure accomplishing required actions.  The PIC will ensure accomplishment of all checklist items and when completed state applicable “Checklist Complete." A25.3.4.  Engine Start/Taxi. A25.3.4.1.  All engine starts require a fireguard. A25.3.4.2.  VTC operator starts the engine on pilot’s command and announces each state of  the  start  process  (engine  parameters,  BIT  checks,  etc.).    Ground  Chase  (“Hawkeye”) will monitor engine start and maintain area control for the pilot. A25.3.4.3.  The pilot taxiing the aircraft should designate only one ‘in-control’ link.  For local  operations,  two  ‘in-control’  links  may  be  utilized  to  ensure  C2  coverage  and mitigate undesired taxi interruptions provided it is briefed and the pilot not in control also executes Stop Taxi commands as required. A25.3.4.4.  Hawkeye  will  maintain  position  to  accurately  assess  the  position  of  the aircraft while taxi operations are performed. He will inform the pilot of any deviations in crosstrack,  heading,  and  speed.    The  pilot  will  inform  Hawkeye  of  impending  turns, speed changes, stops, etc., as required. A25.3.5.  Takeoff. A25.3.5.1.  Do not  taxi  and/or takeoff over a  raised cable or into  a raised webbing-type barrier.  Pilots may takeoff beyond or between raised cables provided there is 8000 ft. of runway beyond or between barriers. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 303 A25.3.5.2.  During  departure/arrival  pilots  will  monitor  the  aircraft  performance  and advise  Air  Traffic  Control  of  any  deviations  from  planned  route  or  Air  Traffic  Control clearance. A25.3.5.3.  Any  crewmember  or  ground  crew  member  noting  a  safety-of-flight malfunction will alert the pilot and give a brief description of the problem.  The pilot will make the decision to continue or abort. A25.3.6.  Approach/Landing. A25.3.6.1.  The  pilot  or  MC  will  pre-coordinate  the  handoff  to  the  LRE  in  the  mission briefing.  Any change to handoff procedures will be briefed during the mission in a non-critical phase of flight.  Positive exchange of aircraft control is mandatory. A25.3.6.2.  All  pilots  will  monitor  the  approach  and  landing  and  backup  the  PIC  as necessary.    All  available  links  should  be  maintained  to  limit  loss  of  communications (Contingency 1).  Good CRM procedures are essential. A25.4.  Instrument Procedures. A25.4.1.  Approach Category.  The RQ-4 is an approach category C aircraft. A25.4.2.  Weather Minimums. A25.4.2.1.  The weather (TEMPO or prevailing) for RQ-4 operations at any airfield must be at  or  above  a ceiling  and visibility of 1000 feet  and 2 miles.  The weather for RQ-4 operations must be at or above these minimums at the time of takeoff and be forecast for the ETA  +/- 2 hours.   If the arrival  window forecast  weather degrades below 1000 feet and  2  miles  during  the  mission,  RQ-4  pilots  will  return  aircraft  to  their  operating  base with sufficient fuel to hold for a minimum of 2 hours (if required) then penetrate and land with  normal  recovery  fuel.    If  the  weather  remains  below  landing  minimums  (1000/2), the  pilot  will  recover  the  aircraft  to  the  designated  alternate  landing  surface  unless landing below weather minimums is approved by the OG/CC. The OG/CC may approve landing  below  weather  minimums  down  to  and  including  zero  feet  ceiling  and  zero visibility conditions. A25.4.2.2.  The  Global  Hawk  aircraft  autonomously  executes  the  planned  approach  and landing without any requirement for visual reference with the runway. For Global Hawk approaches, visibility minimums are observed to allow Hawkeye (SOF), or the pilot using the  aircraft’s  nose  camera,  to  visually  verify  that  the  aircraft  is  on  runway  centerline during the final stages of the approach. A25.4.3.  Self  Contained  Approach  Planning.    All  Global  Hawk  approaches  are  self contained.    Approaches  are  the  product  of  the  GH  Mission  Planning  System,  and  are  built using  predetermined  slopes  appropriate  for  either  normal  or  engine  out  (emergency) operations.    All  approaches  are  constructed  in  compliance  with  local  ATC  restrictions  and host nation agreements.  SCA operations are routine to every flight, and as such, no requests are submitted through HQ or other agencies for approval. A25.4.4.  Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA).  Approaches planned on the mission planning system emulate precision approaches, and as such do not include MDAs. 304 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A25.4.5.  SCA  Construction.  Use  current  DAFIF  sources  for  all  topographical,  point obstruction,  and  airfield  information  (DAFIF  and  Chart  Updates  provided  each  28  days  by NGIA).  NAVAIDs are not used in constructing the approach. A25.4.6.  Enroute  Altitudes.    Descent  to  the  first  point  on  a  Global  Hawk  approach  is generally  from  a  cruising  altitude  near  FL  600,  though  lower  enroute  descents  may  be appropriate  in  some  instances.    The  last  enroute  point  is  assigned  an  attribute  which associates it with the IAF for the desired approach.  Descents are normally spirals performed at the IAF from the operating altitude. A25.4.7.  Obstacle  Clearance:    Use  the  published  FLIP  minimum  and  emergency  safe altitudes  for  the  Inner  Terrain  Clearance  Elevation  (ITCE)  and  Outer  Terrain  Clearance Elevation (OTCE) respectively.  ITCEs and OTCEs interact with the navigation software to ensure that the aircraft remains above those altitudes out to the appropriate distances (25 and 100 NM). A25.4.8.  Global Hawk approaches fall into three categories, Standard, Missed, and Minimal, and  are  constructed  as  described  in  the  next  three  paragraphs.    An  approach  to  any  given runway contains at least two of these three approaches. A25.4.8.1.  Standard Approaches are constructed as depicted in Figure A25.1.  Standard approach glide slope is determined by the planning system based on aircraft performance factors at the estimated gross weight, winds, aircraft configuration and airspeed. Figure A25.1.  RQ-4 Standard Instrument Approach Construction Procedure (typical). A25.4.8.2.  Minimal  Approaches  are  straight-in  approaches  which  begin  ten  miles  from the end of the runway.  They are provided with the planning system as a means of quickly  AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 305 building an approach to a runway or ditch point.  Glideslope values are the same as in a standard approach. A25.4.8.3.  Missed  approaches  are  intended  to  bring  the  aircraft  around  to  a  point  at which  the  approach  may  be  re-attempted.    The  last  point  of  the  missed  approach  is associated  with  the  first  point  of  the  next  approach,  which  may  be  the  same  as  the original  standard  approach,  or  a  shorter,  modified  standard  approach.    Values  for distances between optional waypoints may be selected and filled in by the planner, or not used.  Altitudes are set into the system by the planner. A25.4.9.  Glideslope Planning. for A25.4.9.1.  Approaches  are emergency/engine-out  operations.    Terrain  clearance  is  included  in  the  AFMSS/JMPS function  with  the  appropriate  Digitized  Terrain  Elevation  Data  (DTED)  and  vertical obstruction files loaded. typically  built  using  4.5  degrees,  and  5.25 A25.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A25.5.1.  Minimum  Equipment.    Two  communications  links  are  required  for  flight operations.    Where  applicable  certifications  (e.g.  FAA  COA)  and/or  airspace  regulations allow,  the  OG/CC  may  approve  single  link  operations  for  Higher  Headquarters  (HHQ) directed missions and trans-oceanic transit.  If INMARSAT is the only communications link available, the pilot should keep the air vehicle on a mission-planned track or designated orbit. A25.5.1.1.  Both  the MCE and  LRE will have an active C2 link for terminal  area flight operations.    In  addition,  the  RQ-4  will  not  exit  restricted  airspace  without  two  good command and control links. A25.5.1.2.  The OG/CC is the approval authority for approach and landing with a single C2 link. A25.5.2.  Authorized  Airfields.  The  following  airfields  are  approved  for  use  by  GV  CTF UAS  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-202V3,  paragraph  4.10:    Edwards  AFB,  CA;  Beale  AFB, CA; Grand Forks AFB, ND, Patuxent River NAS, MD. A25.5.3.  Weather  Avoidance.    Thunderstorm  restrictions  and  avoidance  shall  be  IAW  AFI 11-2RQ-4 Volume 3, paragraph 4.3, RQ-4 Operations Procedures.  306 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 Attachment 26 T-6 OPERATING PROCEDURES A26.1.  General Information.  This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives, outlines procedures for operation of the T-6 aircraft under most circumstances.  AFMC aircrews and  all  management  levels  concerned  with  operation  of  all  T-6  aircraft  must  comply  with  the outlined  requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this  attachment.    Operations  or procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished  if  they  enhance  safe,  effective mission accomplishment. A26.2.  Mission Planning.  Complete takeoff and landing data (TOLD) for all flights.  Tab data derived from TO-1T-6A-1 and TO-1T-6A-1CL-1 approved performance charts is acceptable and may be utilized when available.  If utilized, mission planning/TOLD software will comply with paragraph 2.3 of this instruction. A26.2.1.  Runway Requirements.  Minimum runway length  and width  for T-6 operations is 4,000 feet  long by 75  feet  wide.  An intersection takeoff must provide 4,000 feet  of usable runway.  T-6 operations require 4,000 feet between arresting cables located on or above  the runway surface. A26.2.2.  Weather  Requirements.    In  addition  to  the  weather  requirements  listed  in  Table 3.1, during all engine-related and propeller-related check flight sorties, the minimum weather shall allow a line of sight to a suitable airfield within engine-out glide range. A26.2.3.  Crosswind Limitations: A26.2.3.1.  Icy runway—5 knots. A26.2.3.2.  Standing water—5 knots. A26.2.3.3.  Standing water due to patchy standing water (ponding) (as determined by the [supervisor of flying - SOF])—10 knots. A26.2.3.4.  Wet runway—10 knots. A26.2.3.5.  Formation wing takeoffs and landings—15 knots. A26.2.3.6.  Touch-and-go landings—20 knots. A26.2.3.7.  Initial takeoffs and full-stop landings on a dry runway—25 knots. A26.2.4.  Operating  in  High  Wind  or  Sea  States.    T-6  flying  operations  will  be  restricted when high winds or sea states would be hazardous to aircrew members in ejection situations.  Local flights are not permitted over land when steady state surface winds (forecast or actual) in operating areas exceed 35 knots.  Over-water flights will not be permitted when forecast or actual wave heights exceed 10 feet or surface winds exceed 25 knots in training or operating areas. A26.3.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A26.3.1.  General Requirements and Restrictions. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 307 A26.3.1.1.  Unit-Developed Checklists and  Local  Pilot  Aids.  Unit-developed checklists may be used in  lieu of  TO 1T-6A-1CL-1, Pilot’s Abbreviated Flight  Crew Checklist,  if they contain, as a minimum, all items (verbatim and in order) listed in the checklist. A26.3.1.2.  Required    Personal    Equipment.    In  addition  to  equipment  specified  in  AFI 11-202V3, the following requirements apply: A26.3.1.2.1.  Due to the nature of the T-6 egress system, each crewmember will wear a visor during all phases of flight, and should be down prior to lowering the canopy. A26.3.1.2.2.  A  clear  visor  will  be  worn  at  night  or  when  needed  for  restricted visibility. A26.3.2.  Instrument Procedures. A26.3.2.1.  Instrument Approach Category.  The T-6 is approach category B. A26.3.2.2.  Global Positioning System (GPS): A26.3.2.2.1.  The  T-6A  KLN  900  GPS  is  FAA  Technical  Standard  Order  (TSO) C129a,  Airborne Supplemental Navigation Equipment Using the Global Positioning System (GPS), certified  for enroute area navigation (RNAV) GPS approaches down to lateral navigation (LNAV) MDA minimums. A26.3.2.2.2.  The T-6A KLN 900 GPS is FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 90-100A, U. S. Terminal and En Route Area Navigation (RNAV) Operations, certified for RNAV 2  (T  and  Q  routes)  procedures.    It  is  not  possible  to  retrieve  entire  RNAV  T  and  Q routes  from  the  data  base  of  the  KLN  900;  however,  extracting  individual  named fixes from the database is permitted under FAA AC 90-100A, provided all fixes along the  published  route  to  be  flown  are  inserted.    Manual  entry  of  waypoints  using latitude and/or longitude or place and/or bearing is not permitted. A26.3.2.2.3.  The T-6A KLN 900 GPS meets or provides an equivalent level of safety and performance mandated by FAA AC 90-100A for RNAV 1 (standard instrument departures [SID], standard terminal arrivals [STAR], departure procedures [DP]) and is operationally approved to perform these operations with the following restrictions. A26.3.2.2.4.  If flying RNAV SIDs, DPs,  STARs, T or Q routes, aircrew will check predictive receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) for their route of flight during preflight planning at http://www.raimprediction.net or an approved alternate site  to  ensure  GPS  satellite  coverage.    The  T-6A  KLN  900  GPS  does  not  have  a predictive  RAIM  capability  for  these  operations.    Aircrew  should  utilize  the  baro-aided tabs when utilizing these sites. A26.3.2.2.5.  When  flying  an  RNAV  SID,  DP  or  STAR  the  procedure  must  be retrieved by procedure name from the onboard navigation database in its entirety and conform to the charted procedure.  If a SID, DP, or STAR contains a course to fix leg, course  to  altitude  leg,  or  a  fix  to  manual  termination  leg,  utilization  of  the omnibearing  select  (OBS)  function  and  manual  selection  of  the  course  may  be necessary.  While this does not meet the requirement for automation under FAA AC 90-100A  and  FAA  AC  90-105,  Approval  Guidance  for  RNP  Operations  and Barometric Vertical Navigation in the U.S.  National Airspace System, aircrew with 308 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 proper  MAJCOM  directed  training  are  authorized  under  AFI  11-202V3,  to  perform these operations.  Radius to fix legs will not be flown in the T-6A. A26.3.2.2.6.  When  flying  RNAV  SIDs  or  DPs  aircrew  will  have  an  RNAV  GPS approach  loaded  for  the  airfield  that  they  are  departing.    This  will  ensure  proper RAIM sensitivity within 30 nautical miles (NM) of the departure airfield and that the course  deviation  index  (CDI)  is  in  the  proper  scale.    For  SIDs  and  DPs  extending beyond 30 NM, aircrew will select a CDI scale of 1nm from the Mode page for the remainder of the SID or DP.  Note: While it is possible for aircrew to select a desired CDI  scale  for  the  KLN  900,  it  is  not  possible  to  select  the  RAIM  sensitivity.  Improper RAIM sensitivity beyond 30 NM is permitted under FAA AC 90-100A. A26.3.2.2.7.  When flying RNAV STARs aircrew will have an RNAV GPS approach or an approach labeled “or GPS” loaded for their destination to ensure proper RAIM and  CDI  sensitivity  within  30  NM  of  their  destination.    If  commencing  an  RNAV STAR outside of 30 NM, aircrew will change the CDI sensitivity to 1 NM from the Mode page.  Improper RAIM sensitivity beyond 30 NM is permitted under FAA AC 90-100A. A26.3.2.2.8.  When flying conventional SIDs, DPs, and STARs using GPS or RNAV, comply with guidance in AFI 11-202V3 AETC Sup. A26.3.2.2.9.  The  T-6A  KLN  900  GPS  is  installed  according  to  FAA  AC  20-138A, Airworthiness  Approval  of  Global  Navigation  Satellite  System  (GNSS)  Equipment.  The  GPS  equipment  also  employs  step  error  detection  according  to  FAA  TSO  C-129a, which satisfies all requirements in AFI 11-202V3.  This equipment is approved for  en  route,  terminal,  and  nonprecision  approach  operations  and  other  instrument procedures requiring a minimum required navigation performance (RNP) value of 0.3 or greater.  Instrument approaches may be flown in accordance with AFI 11-202V3, and  MAJCOM  and  local  supplements  down  to,  but  not  below,  LNAV  MDA minimums.    Crews  must  complete  MAJCOM-directed  training  for  use  of  these systems down to RNP 0.3 before IFR use.  Fault detection and exclusion (FDE) must be checked before using GPS as a primary source of IFR navigation.  In order to meet the requirements of AFI 11-202V3, FDE must indicate “YES” before using GPS as a primary source of IFR navigation within the National Air Space System. A26.3.3.  Flap Settings: A26.3.3.1.  Aircrew  should  use  TO  or  UP  flap  settings  for  full-stop  and  touch-and-go landings when the crosswind (steady state or gust) exceeds 10 knots.  This is not intended to limit aircrew in the event of emergency or unusual circumstance if the landing (LDG) flap setting is appropriate. A26.3.3.2.  Aircrews  may  use  any  flap  setting  when  flying  multiple  touch-and-go landings. A26.3.3.3.  Crosswind  permitting,  the  LDG  flap  setting  should  be  used  for  full-stop landings  when  the  landing  distance  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  80  percent  of  the  actual field length. A26.3.4.  Out-of-Control Flight (OCF) Recoveries: AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 309 A26.3.4.1.  When  conducting  OCF  recoveries  over  clouds,  plan  to  complete  all  OCF recoveries (to include dive recoveries) at least 3,000 feet above the clouds. A26.3.4.2.  To  avoid  entering  IMC  during  a  check  flight  sortie  where  OCF  and/or  spin recoveries are required, a minimum of 10,000 feet of airspace clear of clouds should exist below OCF or spin entry altitude. A26.3.5.  Minimum Altitudes. A26.3.5.1.  Perform  all  parts  of  aerobatic  maneuvers,  unusual  attitudes,  abnormal  flight recoveries, practice lost  wingman, extended trail, stalls, and slow  flight  only in  special-use airspace and above 6,000 feet AGL. A26.3.5.2.  The minimum altitude to complete configured aircraft slips is 300 feet AGL. A26.3.6.  Icing.  Do not cruise in forecast or reported icing conditions.  Refer to TO 1T-6X-1 for additional icing restrictions. A26.3.7.  Formation. A26.3.7.1.  Maximum Size.  The maximum flight formation size is four aircraft. A26.3.7.2.  Takeoff: A26.3.7.2.1.  Two-ship  formation  wing  takeoffs  require  a  minimum  of  150  feet  of runway width. A26.3.7.2.2.  Minimum wingtip distance will be 20 feet for wing takeoffs. A26.3.7.2.3.  For  wing  takeoffs,  the  ceiling  and  visibility  must  be  greater  than  or equal to circling minimums, or 500 feet and 1 1/2 miles, whichever is higher. A26.3.7.2.4.  For  interval  takeoffs  and  subsequent  rejoins  under  the  weather,  the ceiling and visibility must be greater than or equal to 1,500 feet and 3 miles. A26.3.7.2.5.  Four-ship echelon lineup requires a runway greater than or equal to 300 feet wide. A26.3.7.2.6.  Four-ship  interval  lineup  requires  500  feet  of  element  spacing  on runways less than 200 feet wide. A26.3.7.3.  En  route.    Four-ship  formations  will  not  cruise  in  IMC,  but  may  climb  or descend through IMC. A26.3.7.4.  Approach and Landing: A26.3.7.4.1.  Planned  formation  low  approaches  will  be  initiated  no  lower  than  200 feet AGL so as to comply with the minimum altitude of 100 feet AGL as specified in paragraph 3.3.5.10. A26.3.7.4.2.  Formation  wing  landings  require  a  minimum  of  150  feet  of  runway width. A26.3.7.4.3.  Minimum wingtip distance will be 20 feet for wing landings. A26.3.7.4.4.  For  formation  approaches  and  landings,  the  ceiling  and  visibility  must be  greater  than  or  equal  to  500  feet  and  1  1/2  miles  or  approach  minimums, whichever is higher. 310 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A26.3.8.  Emergency Landing Patterns (ELP): A26.3.8.1.  When  flying  practice  emergency  landing  patterns,  maintain  proper  visual flight rules (VFR) cloud clearances.  Additionally, the ELPs in a tower-controlled pattern require  500  feet  below  clouds  and  3  miles  visibility  according  to  Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) Order 7610.4J Ch 3, Special Military Operations. A26.3.8.2.  When  conducted  in  controlled  airspace,  ELPs  must  be  coordinated  with  the ATC agencies responsible for the airspace the ELP will transit. A26.3.9.  AOA Patterns.  When flying AOA patterns, the following restrictions apply: A26.3.9.1.  AOA  patterns  will  not  be  flown  to  AOA  landings.    Aircrews  will  fly  AOA patterns to a normal roundout and flared touchdown. A26.3.9.2.  AOA patterns will not be flown when the tower is reporting wind gusts. A26.3.9.3.  AOA patterns may be flown with all flap settings.  AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 311 Attachment 27 T-38 OPERATING PROCEDURES A27.1.  General Information.  This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives, outlines procedures for operation of the T-38 aircraft under most circumstances.  AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all T-38 series aircraft must comply with the outlined requirements and consult AFMC/A3V for waivers to this attachment.  Operations or procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished  if  they  enhance  safe,  effective mission accomplishment. A27.2.  Mission Planning. A27.2.1.  Takeoff Requirements. A27.2.1.1.  Compute  takeoff  and  landing  data  for  all  flights.    MAJCOM  approved  tab data  may  be  used  when  available.    Also,  558th  ASCG  T-38C  (PMP)  and  T-38C  (non-PMP) TOLD calculators may be used. A27.2.1.2.  Operations  without  a  BAK-15.    Use  Refusal  Speed  (RS)  -  Both  Engines Operating  (RS-BEO)  as  Go/No-Go  speed  when  Decision  Speed  (DS)  is  less  than  RS-BEO. A27.2.1.2.1.  When  DS  is  greater  than  RS-BEO,  the  OG/CC  (or  designated representative)  approval  is  required.    Use  Refusal  Speed  Engine  Failure  (RS-EF)  as the  Go/No-Go  speed.    (Note:  Aborts  for  other  than  engine  failure  (e.g.,  generator lights,  fire  lights,  etc.)  initiated  between  RS-BEO  and  RS-EF  may  result  in overrunning the runway surface.) A27.2.1.2.2.  When DS is greater than RS-EF takeoffs are not authorized. A27.2.1.3.  Operations with a BAK-15.   Use Refusal Speed - Engine Failure (RS-EF) as Go/No-Go speed when DS is less than or equal to RS-EF.  (Note: Aborts for other than engine failure (e.g., generator lights, fire lights, etc.) initiated between RS-BEO and RS-EF may result in barrier engagement.) A27.2.1.3.1.  When  DS  is  greater  than  RS-EF  and  less  than  Takeoff  Speed  (TOS), takeoffs are allowed with OG/CC (or designated representative) approval.  Use TOS as  Go/No-Go  speed  with  a  remotely  controlled  BAK-15.    With  a  non-remotely controlled BAK-15 in the raised position use Single Engine Takeoff Speed (SETOS) as Go/No-Go speed. A27.2.1.3.2.  When DS  is greater than or equal  to  TOS, or DS  & SETOS cannot  be validated,  takeoffs  are  not  authorized  unless  specific  procedures  for  operational requirements are developed and approved by the OG/CC.  (Note: For some extreme combinations  of  temperature  and  pressure  altitude,  the  performance  charts  will  not yield  a  valid  DS  or  SETOS.    This  occurs  on  the  DS  chart  where  the  curves  on  the gross weight plot do not extend far enough upwards and on the SETOS chart where the gross weight plot is labeled "SINGLE ENGINE TAKEOFFS NOT POSSIBLE.") A27.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A27.3.1.  General Requirements and Restrictions. 312 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A27.3.1.1.  Pilots must take into consideration deviations from standard day temperatures at  altitude  when  planning  flights  above  FL300.    The  engine  compressor  stall/flameout susceptibility  area  chart  will  be  consulted  and  flight  will  not  be  planned  into  the  black striped area. A27.3.2.  Ground/Taxi Operations. A27.3.2.1.  Cold Weather Start. A27.3.2.1.1.  In  the  event  of  T-38C  EED  oil  pressure  indicator  erroneously  latching red immediately after a battery start in cold weather (oil pressure in excess of 55 psi), pilots are authorized to continue operating engines until oil pressure returns to within ops limits and then clear the latched oil pressure indication by, with both engines at IDLE,  monitoring  engine  operation  via  the  EED  Repeater  in  the  MFD  while performing EED IBIT as detailed in the aircraft flight manual. A27.3.3.  Air-to-Air Operations. A27.3.3.1.  Maneuvering Limitations. A27.3.3.1.1.  Minimum airspeed during offensive or defensive air-to-air maneuvering below 5,000 ft. AGL is 350 KIAS. A27.3.3.1.2.  Minimum maneuvering airspeed during ACBT is 150 KIAS. A27.3.4.  Air-to-Surface. A27.3.4.1.  Off-Range  Attacks.  With  expendable  ordnance  loaded  on  the  aircraft, simulated  weapons  employment  off  range  is  permitted.    However,  the  master  arm  must remain safe, and the pickle button or trigger will not be used. A27.3.4.2.  Popup Attacks.  Abort pop-up attacks if airspeed decreases below 300 KIAS. A27.3.4.3.  Night Weapons Delivery and Range Operations.  Night weapons delivery and range operations are prohibited. A27.3.5.  Low-level A27.3.5.1.  The minimum airspeed on low-level navigation routes is 300 KIAS. A27.3.5.2.  Low-level  missions  will  be  flown  no  lower  than  500  feet  AGL  unless specified in an approved test plan or approved by the OG/CC, and the aircrew is LASDT qualified and current. A27.4.  Instrument Procedures. A27.4.1.  The T-38C is approach category E. A27.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A27.5.1.  Icing Restrictions.  Do not cruise in forecast or reported icing conditions. Climbs or descents through forecast icing conditions more severe than light rime are prohibited. A27.5.2.  Maneuvering Parameters. A27.5.2.1.  On other than FCF missions, enter T-38 stalls and slow flight  below 20,000 feet MSL and terminate above 8,000 feet AGL. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 313 A27.5.2.2.  Aerobatic Maneuvers. A27.5.2.2.1.  Aircraft will not  descend below 5,000 feet AGL  during  any portion of aerobatic maneuvering.  Aerobatic flight must be performed in special use airspace. A27.5.2.2.2.

General Information.  This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives, outlines  procedures  for  operation  of  the  U-2  aircraft  under  most  circumstances.    AF  and contractor aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all U-2 aircraft must comply with the outlined requirements and consult AFMC/A3V for waivers to this attachment.  Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment. A28.2.  Mission Planning. A28.2.1.  Flight Logs. A28.2.1.1.  Flight  logs  generated  using  the  approved  mission  planning  software  “Green Card” are authorized. A28.2.2.  Minimum Oxygen Requirements. A28.2.2.1.  T.O.  U-2S-1  minimum  oxygen  requirements  may  be  waived  by  the  OG/CC for  a  short  ferry  flight  or  during  mission  unique  situations.  This  waiver  will  be documented and attached to the flight mission paperwork. A28.3.  Common Mission Guidance. A28.3.1.  Specific Maneuvers. A28.3.1.1.  Approach  and  Landings.    Conduct  multiple  patterns,  touch  and  go  landings, and simulated emergency patterns only when a qualified instructor pilot is in the aircraft or occupying the mobile vehicle.   A qualified SOF/FSS must be in  the  mobile and in  a position to monitor the pattern and landing.  (Note: An ACC qualified mobile meets the requirements of this paragraph.) A28.3.1.2.  Do  not  intentionally  perform  touch  and  go  landings  or  practice  emergency patterns with Primary Mission Equipment (PME) on board. A28.3.1.3.  All  AFMC  and  Contractor  U-2  pilots  are  authorized  to  perform  SFOs  to  a touch and go or full stop. A28.3.1.4.  All AFMC and Contractor U-2 pilots are authorized to perform touch and go landings  at  any  military  airfield  in  the  local  training  area,  to  include  Beale  AFB, consistent with the above mobile requirement. A28.3.2.  Supervisory Requirements. A28.3.2.1.  A  qualified  SOF  or  Flight  Safety  Supervisor  (FSS)  will  monitor  all  initial takeoffs and full stop landings.  The control room will monitor every test sortie flown and a SOF or  Flight  Safety  Supervisor from  the mobile vehicle will monitor every take-off, approach,  and  recovery.    Additional  information  about  the  SOF  and  FSS  program  is contained in AFLCMC Det 4 sup to AFMCI 11-201. A28.3.3.  Personal GPS Units (PGUs)/Tablets. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 315 A28.3.3.1.  Aircrew members will not use PGUs/Tablets for routine en-route navigation. Follow  PGU/Tablet  guidance  in  AFI  11-202V3  and  the  AFMC  Electronic  Flight  Bag CONEMP.    (Note:  PGUs  carried  by  U-2  pilots  are  used  for  emergency  and  situational awareness use only) A28.4.  Instrument Procedures  . A28.4.1.  The U-2 is approach category B. A28.4.2.  Instrument evaluations will not routinely be conducted in the U-2. A28.5.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A28.5.1.  Weather Restrictions. A28.5.1.1.  Operations during high winds result in an increased risk, primarily caused by higher  possibility  of  crosswind  problems,  windshear,  and  turbulence.    The  following wind limits will be used when determining go-no go weather. A28.5.1.2.  Maximum forecast wind, to include gust effects, for launch is 30 knots.  Once airborne,  a  recall  should  be  initiated  if  the  forecast  wind  (gust)  exceeds  35  knots.  Maximum  wind  for  actual  landing  is  not  specified,  however,  consideration  should  be given to the crosswind component  (15 knots maximum recommended), gust factors, and the aircraft tow limit of 40 knots.  Note: Sorties may launch if the landing is planned for one hour prior to  the effective time of the out  of limit  wind forecast.   Planned landings one  hour  after  the  effective  time  are  not  recommended.  The  OG/CC  may  waive  these wind restrictions dependent on mission priorities. A28.5.1.3.  Takeoff.  Maximum tail wind for initial takeoff is 10 knots. A28.5.1.4.  Touch  and  Go's.    When  flying  touch  and  go’s:  the  maximum  crosswind component limit is 12 knots and a maximum tail wind component is 5 knots. A28.5.2.  Functional Check Flight (FCF). A28.5.2.1.  Initial  FCF/ACF  weather  minimums  are  a  5000  foot  ceiling,  with  5  miles visibility.  This  limit  may  be  waived,  by  the  412  OG/CC  for  USAF  pilots  and  by AFMC/A3V  for  contractor  pilots,  to  the  minimums  specified  in  chapter  3  of  this instruction. Additionally, weather should allow continuous visual contact with the ground sufficient to allow a VMC recovery to either the primary airport or emergency alternates. A28.5.2.2.  Subsequent  ACF  and  FCF  minimums:  3000  foot  ceiling  and  3  miles visibility. This limit may be waived by the OG/CC to the minimums specified in chapter 3 of this instruction. A28.5.3.  Weather Minimums. A28.5.3.1.  Minimum  weather  required  for  engineering  support  flights,  if  not  otherwise specified, is 1500 feet and 3 miles visibility or as outlined in the test plan, whichever is more restrictive.  This minimum may be waived by the OG/CC but will not deviate from the specifics of the approved test plan and safety review board recommendations. A28.5.3.2.  Operational,  Training  and  Delivery  flights  will  follow  command  weather minimums. 316 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A28.5.4.  Crew Rest Requirements. A28.5.4.1.  Fatigue associated with flights in pressure suits and at high cabin altitudes is very insidious and accelerated by less than ideal crew rest prior to flight. The following restrictions apply to high altitude pressure suit flights: A28.5.4.2.  Pressure  suit  flying  in  excess  of  6.5  hours,  in  a  24-hour  period  requires  18 hours recovery time between high flight landing and any subsequent takeoff. A28.5.4.3.  No  more  than  two  pressure  suit  flights  allowed  in  a  12-hour period  or  three total sorties allowed in a 24-hour period. (A sortie includes an engine start, take off, and engine shutdown). A28.5.4.4.  No more than 13 flying hours in a 48 hour period. A28.5.4.5.  Maximum high altitude pressure suit sortie hours in any seven-day period is 25 hours. A28.5.4.6.  Crew  duty  day  for  pressure  suit  flying  is  10  hours.  The  OG/CC,  GFR, operations officer, or LMAC Chief Pilot may waive this to 12 hours, with the consent of the  pilot  flying.  Waivers  to  12  hours  for  any  night  flight  will  be  approved  by  the  412 OG/CC for USAF pilots and by AFMC/A3V for contractor pilots, but only under extreme circumstances.  For  flights  requiring  duty  periods  greater  than  12  hours,  MAJCOM/DO approval  is  required.  Document  all  waiver  action  in  the  remarks  section  of  the  flight authorization. A28.5.5.  Pressure Suit Requirements. A28.5.5.1.  A  full  pressure  suit  will  be  worn  for  all  high  flights  (flights  above  FL  450) and crewmembers will pre-breath 100 percent oxygen for a minimum of one hour prior to takeoff.  AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 317 Attachment 29 V-22 OPERATING PROCEDURES A29.1.  General Information.  This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives, outlines  procedures  for  operation  of  the  V-22  aircraft  under  most  circumstances.    AFMC aircrews and all management levels  concerned with operation of all V-22 aircraft must comply with  the  outlined  requirements  and  consult  AFMC/A3V  for  waivers  to  this  attachment.  Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment. A29.1.1.  Unless otherwise stated in this instruction, the V-22 is considered a helicopter for the purpose of terminal area operations (takeoff, approach, and landing) or with the nacelles off the down stops and below 140 KCAS. The V-22 will be considered a fixed wing for other operations. A29.2.  Mission Planning. A29.2.1.  Flight Planning Systems. The primary flight/mission planning system is the Special Operations Forces Planning and Rehearsal System (SOFPARS). SOFPARS is a subset of the Air  Force  Mission  Support  System  (AFMSS)  that  includes  the  Portable  Flight  Planning Software (PFPS) and the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). The core mission planning software  (PFPS  or  JMPS)  in  conjunction  with  V-22-specific  modules  and  hardware interfaces is known as the V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS). A29.2.2.  For flight planning purposes, fuel requirements for descent,  approach, and missed approach will be no less than 1,200 pounds. A29.2.3.  Weight and Balance. If the basic weight/moment of the aircraft is changed, a new DD  Form  365-4,  Weight  and  Balance  Clearance  Form  F-Transport,  will  be  computed.  A new or corrected DD Form 365-4 need not be recomputed provided the initial takeoff gross weight (item 16) is not changed by more than 500 lbs. If the change is more than 500 lbs., the crew will modify the weight and balance using the cockpit management system (CMS). The crew will ensure CG and weight limits are not exceeded. These computations will be briefed during the crew, mission brief, or during flight, as required. A29.2.4.  Weather Planning. A29.2.4.1.  OG/CCs  or  equivalent  may  establish  minimum  weather  criteria  (ceiling  or visibility) less than day minimums for flights during which only hovering maneuvers will be performed (i.e. hover checks, OCF, FCF). A29.2.4.2.  VFR  Minimums.    Comply  with  AFI  11-202V3,  weather  minimums  unless local weather minimums are more restrictive. In the absence of more restrictive criteria, the  following  minimum  weather  criteria  (ceiling/visibility)  apply  during  all  VFR operations: A29.2.4.2.1.  Day/NVG: A29.2.4.2.1.1.  VTOL/CONV (≥60 nacelle): 500/2 SM. A29.2.4.2.1.2.  APLN (<60 nacelle): 1,000/3 SM. A29.2.4.2.2.  Night (Unaided): 1,500/3 SM. 318 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A29.2.4.3.  IFR Minimums.  Use category A approach minimums and comply with AFI 11-202V3  helicopter  weather  minimums  unless  local  weather  minimums  are  more restrictive.  If the reported ceiling is below minimums for the approach, but the visibility value  is  at  or  above  the  authorized  minimums  before  initiating  an  en-route  descent  or published  approach,  ensure  fuel  remaining  is  sufficient  to  accomplish  the  en-route descent, approach, missed approach, and flight to alternate with appropriate reserves. A29.2.4.4.  Illumination and NVG Requirements. A29.2.4.4.1.  Any  training  or  test  missions  planned  when  the  effective  illumination (regardless of methodology or measurement) is forecast to be less than 10 percent, or .8  millilux,  during  the  mission  will  require  an  additional  level  of  Operational  Risk Management (ORM). A29.2.4.4.2.  The Squadron CC/DO will be made aware of the ORM assessment and risk  mitigation  conducted  for  missions  planned  to  be  flown  in  low  illumination conditions. A29.2.5.  En  Route  Planning.  Crews  should  fly  test  missions  at  the  highest  altitude commensurate with test requirements. A29.2.6.  Low-level Planning. Maps with a scale of 1:500,000 or greater detail are required for low-level operations.  Maps with a scale of 1:250,000 or greater are highly desired. A29.2.6.1.  Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). ESA is an altitude that will provide positive terrain  clearance  in  IMC  during  situations  that  require  the  exiting  of  the  low-level environment. To compute ESA, add 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) to the highest  obstacle  or  terrain  feature  within  10  NM  of  route  centerline  or  intended  flight path,  rounded  to  the  next  100-  foot  increment.  Use  of  area  ESAs  is  recommended whenever  possible,  however,  a  single  ESA  is  sufficient  when  there  are  no  significant changes in topography. A29.2.6.1.1.  Failure to maintain an accurate altimeter setting during flight may cause lower than planned terrain clearances or impact with terrain when using the computed emergency safe altitude ESA/MSA. A29.2.6.2.  Minimum  Safe  Altitude  (MSA).  MSA  provides  terrain  clearance  during situations that require the interruption of low-level operations. To compute MSA for each leg or leg segment, add  500 feet  (or the planned set  clearance  for TF operations) to  the elevation of the highest terrain or obstacle within 3 NM of route centerline or the planned flight path, and round up to the next 100-foot increment. A29.2.6.2.1.  Failure to maintain an accurate altimeter setting during flight may cause lower than planned terrain clearances or impact with terrain when using the computed emergency safe altitude ESA/MSA. A29.2.6.3.  Aeronautical  Chart  Preparation.  Pilots  will  carry  a  chart  on  all  flights  and ensure all charts used for flight have the most current hazards posted. Aircrew will also ensure appropriate civil airspace is annotated along their route of flight. A29.2.6.4.  Route  Surveys.  Prior  to  any  low-level  operations  in  non-surveyed  areas, accomplish a survey of the route or area as follows: AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 319 A29.2.6.4.1.  Conduct  an  extensive  map  study  of  the  selected  routes  and  areas. Annotate  all  manmade  obstacles  over  50  feet  AGL  (or  the  lowest  altitude  to  be flown),  except  when  below  the  tree  line.  Additionally,  annotate  any  published  low-level  routes,  avoid  areas  or  other  hazards  within  the  boundaries.  Use  the  VVOD  to ensure current obstacles are depicted on maps. A29.2.6.4.2.  Fly the survey during the day. Conduct a visual search of the proposed route or area at the lowest applicable altitude down to a minimum altitude of 50 feet AGL in CONV mode or 100 feet AGL in APLN mode. Check the obstacle location against map location and any additional obstacles charted. A29.2.6.4.3.  If  a  route  or  area  has  been  inactive  or  flight  operations  have  not  been conducted  at  survey  minimums  for  12  months,  re-accomplish  the  survey  or  restrict operations to or above the lowest level flown during the 12-month period. A29.2.7.  Crew Complement. The crew complement for operations is  specified in  the flight manual and Table A29.1. Table A29.1.  Crew Complement. Pilot  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Copilot Flight Engineer Mission  Engine Ground Run1 Ferry/FCF/Prof3 Day4/Night Tactical4/LVAs Air Refueling Hot Refueling2 Notes: 1.  Minimum crew is either 1 Pilot and 1 Flight Engineer or 2 Pilots. 2.  Only one FE is required while operating at a location with sufficient ground crew to perform hot refueling duties. 3.  This mission category includes all basic non-tactical operations to and from improved/approved areas (airfields, helipads, etc.) day and night. Qualified crews may use night vision goggles (NVGs) as appropriate to improve general flight safety. 4.  At the discretion of the squadron (SQ/CC), crew complement may be 2 pilots and 1 Flight Engineer (FE). Crew complement will not be reduced if Low Visibility Approaches (LVAs) are anticipated. 1 1 2 1 2 A29.2.8.  Security.  V-22  aircraft  are  priority  C  resources  when  they  are  not  configured  for special  missions  that  require  higher  security  priority.  This  security  priority  designation applies  to  operational  aircraft  worldwide.  Some  aircraft  contain  equipment  and  documents which require protection per DOD 5200.1, DOD Information Security Program/AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. Requirements for protection of the aircraft in a transient status at US and foreign bases are found in DOD 5200.1 and AFI 31-401. A29.2.9.  Arming of Crewmembers. Unit commanders may direct arming of crewmembers as deemed  necessary  by  mission  threat  analysis.  During  operations  where  weapons  are  on board, it may be necessary to arm a weapon qualified aircrew member. Protect these weapons and others installed IAW AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel and AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual. 320 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A29.3.  Mission Guidance. A29.3.1.  Landing Zones. thorough  review  of A29.3.1.1.  A landing  zone  survey  and  accompanying photographs  or  imagery  will  be  accomplished  by  all  crewmembers  during  the  aircrew brief. The PIC is responsible for ensuring that any crewmember unable to attend the brief either  reviews  the  landing  zone  survey  or  is  briefed  on  the  hazards  associated  with  the LZ. the A29.3.1.2.  V-22 aircrew will follow procedures for Helicopter Landing Zones in AFI 13-217. A29.3.2.  Altitude Restrictions. Except for navigation profiles flown as part of approved test plans or in conjunction with FCF profiles, do not operate the aircraft lower than the altitudes shown below. A29.3.2.1.  Conduct  all  APLN  mode  operations  at  or  above  500  feet  AGL  and CONV/VTOL  mode  operations  above  300  feet  AGL,  except  when  lower  altitudes  are required for takeoff, landing, test missions, training flights in approved surveyed areas or routes, or while conducting a route survey under day VMC. A29.3.2.2.  Conduct  low-level  sorties  in  mountainous  terrain  no  lower  than  300  ft. modified  contour  or  200  ft.  set  clearance  plane  (SCP)  in  airplane  mode,  or  100  ft.  in CONV  mode.  In  non-mountainous  terrain  or  over  water  where  there  is  a  valid  mission requirement,  crews  may  descend  to  no  lower  than  100  feet  AGL  in  APLN  and  50  ft. CONV  with  Sq/DO  approval.  Limit  the  time  at  minimum  altitudes  to  the  duration required  for  mission  accomplishment.  Without  an  operational  FLIR,  lowest  altitude permitted is 500 ft. modified contour. A29.3.2.3.  Unaided (no NVG and no TF system).  Minimum en-route altitude for night navigation,  for testing and training, is  500 feet  above the highest  obstacle within 3 NM (MSA). A29.3.2.4.  Aided.  NVGs  or  TF  systems  are  the  only  approved  methods  for  conducting night operations below 500 feet AGL. Time spent at the minimum altitude should be the minimum  required  to  complete  the  test  or  complete  mission  proficiency  training  and night water operations. A29.3.3.  Low-level  Operations.  The  low-level  environment  is  defined  as  operations  below 500’ AGL in APLN mode and 300’ AGL in CONV/VTOL mode during the day.  The night NVG low-level environment is defined as operations below 1000’ AGL in APLN mode and 500’ AGL in CONV/VTOL mode. A29.3.4.  IMC Terrain Following (TF)/Terrain Avoidance (TA) Training. A29.3.4.1.  IMC  TF  flight  may  be  accomplished  on  published  IFR  Military  Training Routes (IR).  The lowest set clearance plan (SCP) will be in accordance with published route restrictions or 300 feet, whichever is higher. A29.3.4.2.  Prior  to  entering  IMC  conditions  the  aircrew  must  ensure  the  TF/TA  radar and navigation systems are functioning properly. AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 321 A29.3.4.3.  Altitude  Restrictions.  For  IMC  TF/TA  en-route  training,  the  minimum altitude is 200 feet SCP. A29.3.4.4.  IMC  TF  and  flight  director  (FD)  approach  (APPR)  approaches  will  be conducted  to  surveyed/approved  landing  zones  along  specified  routes.  Visual  contact with the ground allowing confirmation of aircraft position and drift state (by someone on the crew) will be established prior to decelerating below 30 KGS. A29.3.4.5.  Degraded  systems  training  will  not  be  conducted  during  IMC  TF/TA operations. A29.4.  Operating Procedures and Restrictions. A29.4.1.  Aircraft Equipment. A29.4.1.1.  General.  A  fully  mission  capable  aircraft  is  the  ultimate  objective  of  the logistics effort. The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission rests with the aircraft commander.  If one aircraft commander accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that aircraft commander, or a different aircraft commander, to subsequent operations with the  same  item  or  system  inoperative.    When  the  aircraft  commander  considers  an  item essential, designate the component mission essential (ME) on the AFTO Form 781, and the item will be repaired or replaced prior to departure.  This section provides guidance on how to operate with degraded equipment. A29.4.1.1.1.  Radar Altimeter. The radar altimeter will be operational for night, low-level tactical events as well as all low-level operations over open water. A29.4.1.1.2.  Avionics  Cooling.  Avionics  cooling  will  be  operational  prior  to departure.  Should  avionics  cooling  malfunction  after  departure,  flight  may  be continued  as  long  as  airspeed  is  at  or  above  200  KCAS.  Flight  below  200  KCAS should be minimized to the maximum extent possible. A29.4.1.1.3.  Environmental  Control  System  (ECS).  If  environmental  conditions permit,  the aircraft may  be flown without ECS.  Crew comfort, type of  mission, and length of mission should be considered when deciding whether or not to proceed. A29.4.1.1.4.  Electrical  Systems.  If  a  variable  frequency  generator  (VFG)  fails  at  an en route stop, the mission may continue.  Loss of a single VFG and/or converter with no other system failures will not adversely impact the electrical system and flight may be  continued  at  the  discretion  of  the  PIC.    Comply  with  all  flight  manual  guidance.  Continued  operations  with  1  VFG  inoperative  are  authorized  for  a  period  not  to exceed 35 flight hours. A29.4.1.1.5.  Fuel Systems. Degraded operation is permissible, however, flight crews must  consider  potentially  trapped  fuel  (center  of  gravity  (CG)  limits)  and  decreased range should further degradation occur. A29.4.1.1.5.1.  Fuel Pumps. All suction lift pumps should be operational prior to departure. All boost pumps will be operational prior to departure. A29.4.1.1.5.2.  Operations will not be conducted with any malfunction in the fuel system that affects the fuel quantity warning system. 322 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A29.4.1.1.6.  Landing Gear. If a landing gear malfunction is encountered, only a full stop landing will be made. The discrepancy will be corrected prior to the next flight. Exception:  If  repair  capability  does  not  exist  and  a  positive  determination  is  made that  further  flight  can  be  accomplished  with  the  gear  down  and  locked,  the  aircraft may be flown to a destination where repair capability exists provided the gear is not moved  from  the  down  and  locked  position.  Required  en-route  stops  are  authorized. Takeoffs and landings should be minimized and made from a hover. A29.4.1.1.7.  Navigation Systems. The aircraft will not be flown with more than one inertial navigation system (INS) failure as this would remove any redundancy in the aircraft attitude indicating system and flight control system. A29.4.1.1.8.  Cockpit  Displays.  If  the  standby  altitude  indicator  (AI)  is  inoperative, the  aircraft  may  only  be  flown  in  day  visual  meteorological  conditions  (VMC) conditions. Flight in night VMC conditions permitted if night vision goggles (NVGs) are used. If any of the standby pitot-static instruments are inoperative, the aircraft will not be flown. Should there be degraded performance or damage to pitot-static probes 1, 2, or 4, standby instrumentation will be affected and the aircraft will not be flown.  As  a  minimum,  one  operating  multi-function  display  (MFD)  is  required  at  the  pilot and the copilot position and one operable display electronics unit (DEU) is required. A29.4.2.  Aircrew Flight Equipment Requirements. Upon reporting to the aircraft, the PIC or designated  representative  will  ensure  sufficient  quantities  of  appropriate  serviceable  aircre flight  equipment,  survival  equipment,  and  protective  clothing  are  aboard  the  aircraft.  Aircrew flight equipment and medical kits below 200 lbs may be secured with seat belts. A29.4.2.1.  Aircrew members will wear life preservers and underwater breathing devices on  overwater  flights  when  route  of  flight  is  beyond  gliding  distance  of  the  shore. Passengers  will  have  life  preservers  available  and  will  be  worn  at  the  discretion  of  the Pilot in Command. Life rafts will be available to cover all personnel on board. Life rafts, life  preservers,  and  helicopter  emergency  egress  device  (HEED)/Helicopter  Aircrew Breathing Device (HABD) are not required when over-water flight occurs only for short distances, takeoff, approach, and before landing. A29.4.2.2.  Survival  vests  will  be  onboard  the  aircraft  and  available  to  the  crew  for  all flights and may be worn at the discretion of the PIC. A29.4.2.3.  Crewmembers  occupying  a  primary  crew  position  should  accomplish  a communications and operations check of their oxygen masks prior to flight. This oxygen mask will remain connected and readily available for cockpit crewmembers and available for cabin crewmembers for use before engine start until after engine shutdown. A29.4.2.4.  V-22  crews  will  use  helicopter  requirements  for  over  water  flight.  See  AFI 11-301, MAJCOM Sup 1, for further guidance. A29.4.3.  Flying Clothing/Safety Equipment. A29.4.3.1.  Eye Protection. A29.4.3.1.1.  Use protective goggles, plastic/shatter resistant lens, glasses/sunglasses, or  the  helmet  visor  for  eye  protection  if  duties  require  personnel  to  be  in  close AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 323 proximity  of  the  aircraft  when  the  proprotors  are  turning.  Wear  goggles  whenever dust, sand, dirt, etc., constitute a hazard. A29.4.3.1.2.  During  all  live  firing  of  weapons  from  the  aircraft,  ensure  that  all personnel involved in the firing of weapons wear eye protection to include one of the following:  helmet  visors,  shatter  resistant  glasses/eye  protection,  safety  goggles,  or aircrew gas mask. Glass lens eyeglasses alone do not satisfy the requirement. A29.4.4.  Maximum Flight Duty Period (FDP). A29.4.4.1.  FCF/ACF,  proficiency  training,  test  sorties,  test  support  sorties  and  tactical events  must  be  completed  during  the  first  12  hours  of  the  FDP  and  are  limited  to  a maximum of three sorties per day. A29.4.4.2.  The  basic  FDP  is  16  hours  provided  no  tactical  events,  test  sorties,  test support  sorties,  proficiency  training,  Functional  Check  Flights  (FCF)  (including maintenance ground runs) are accomplished after 12 hours and no Aerial Refueling (AR) is accomplished after 14 hours. If the autopilot (coupled modes) is not  fully operational for the required mission profile, or its use is denied for more than 4 hours, the FDP will be  12  hours.  A  fully  operational  autopilot  is  defined  as  a  system  which  is  capable  of coupling  course  (ENAV  or  INAV),  speed,  and  altitude.  For  the  purposes  of  this paragraph,  NVG  terminal  operations  to  a  prepared  surface  are  not  considered  tactical events and use of NVGs is authorized throughout the flight duty period. A29.4.4.3.  The OG/CC or equivalent may extend FDP up to 2 hours IAW AFI11-202V3 and AFMC Supplement. A29.4.5.  Checklist.  Accomplish  all checklists with  strict discipline using the challenge  and response method as required. A29.4.6.  Aircraft Forms/Fuel Card.  Review the aircraft forms before applying power to the aircraft or operating aircraft systems.  Ensure that the USAF fuel card and/or other authorized method of payment are aboard the aircraft. A29.4.7.  Control.    A  qualified  pilot  will  be  at  a  set  of  flight  controls  at  all  times  when proprotors are turning. A29.4.8.  Crew Duties and Responsibilities. A29.4.8.1.  Change  of  Aircraft  Control.    The  change  of  flight  controls  will  be accomplished  using  a  positive  change  of  controls.  Use  a  statement  which  includes  the crew position such as,  “Pilot/Copilot has controls” to transfer control. The other aircrew member  will  acknowledge  using  the  crew  position  also  such  as,  “Pilot/Copilot  has controls.” A29.4.8.2.  Boldface.    The  aircraft  commander  normally  calls  for  boldface  procedure execution.    The  pilot  not  flying  should  be  the  primary  crewmember  responsible  for executing  BOLDFACE  and  other  emergency  checklist  procedures  that  involve  cockpit switches  while  the  pilot  flying  maintains  aircraft  control  and  reacts  appropriately.  The flight  engineer,  if  in  the  cockpit,  will  confirm  any  switches  prior  to  being  actuated  and will reference the checklist for guidance during the emergency. Additional crewmembers, if on board, should review the flight manual and assist as needed/requested. 324 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 A29.4.9.  Communications. A29.4.9.1.  Interphone Communications. A29.4.9.1.1.  Limit intercommunication system (ICS) transmissions to those essential for crew coordination. A29.4.9.1.2.  Clearance is required from the PIC prior to going off ICS. A29.4.9.2.  The pilot operating radios will brief the crew on which radio is primary. All crewmembers will monitor the primary radio unless specifically directed to do otherwise by the PIC. A29.4.9.2.1.  Regardless  of  the  primary  radio,  monitor  ultra  high  frequency  (UHF) GUARD (243.0). A29.4.10.  Aircraft  Lighting.  Operate  aircraft  lighting  IAW  AFI  11-202V3,  MAJCOM supplements.    Additionally,  All  anticollision  lights  will  be  operational  for  day  or  night operations.    When  flying  in  formation,  only  the  trail  aircraft  is  required  to  have  a  visible anticollision light on.  In the event of failure of any light or all lights of the anticollision light system after takeoff, flight may be continued. A29.4.11.  Arresting  Cables.  Avoid  rolling  over  arresting  cables  at  high  speed  to  preclude damage to the bottom of the aircraft. A29.4.12.  Proprotor  Turning  Offload  and  Onload  Procedures.    Employ  the  following procedures when engines are running: A29.4.12.1.  Do not approach the aircraft until cleared by the crew. A29.4.12.2.  Place one engine  condition  lever  (ECL) in  START (or reduce both  ECLs), when  practical,  to  reduce  the  proprotor  downwash  whenever  personnel  are  present  near the aircraft. A29.4.12.3.  Personnel  and  equipment  should  approach  and  depart  between  the  4  and  8 o’clock  position  during  engine  running  ground  operations.  When  using  the  crew  door, approach and depart from the nose of the aircraft as much as possible to stay in the pilot’s field of view until clear of the aircraft. Avoid the regions directly outboard of the nacelles (3 and 9 o’clock) due to engine exhaust deflected by the coanda system. A29.4.13.  Oxygen Requirements. Comply with AFI 11-202V3, for unpressurized aircraft. A29.4.14.  Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. A29.4.14.1.

In  the  absence  of  qualified  maintenance  personnel,  aircrew  may  service aircraft hydraulic and oil systems IAW the flight manual. A29.4.15.  Forced or Precautionary Landings. If the crew becomes doubtful of the aircraft’s airworthiness  or  encounters  hazardous  weather  conditions  preventing  further  flight,  they should  execute  a  precautionary  landing,  provided  the  landing  conditions  are  not  more hazardous  than  the  in-flight  problem.  Report  all  precautionary  landings  through  the appropriate chain of command as soon as communications are established. A29.4.16.  Radar Altimeter Procedures. A29.4.16.1.  During low-level operations, the recommended low altitude warning setting is 80 percent of intended cruise altitude. A29.4.16.2.  For  instrument  approaches,  set  the  radar  altimeter  low  altitude  warning  to the appropriate height above touchdown (HAT) or height above aerodrome (HAA) prior to the final approach fix (FAF). A29.4.17.  Radar Advisories. Participate to the maximum extent possible while operating in VFR or simulated IFR conditions. A29.4.18.  Power Checks. A29.4.18.1.  Aircrew  will  reconfirm  power  requirements  using  either  the  cockpit management  system  (CMS)  or  performance  charts  when  power  required  is  within  ten (10) percent of power available. A29.4.18.2.  Takeoff  and  landing  will  be  executed  utilizing  interim  power  at  the  pilot’s discretion. For tactical approaches to and from LZs, interim power will be used. A29.4.19.  Personnel Restraints. A29.4.19.1.  Aircrew. At least one pilot will have seat belt and shoulder harness fastened when  engines  are  running.  Crewmembers  may  perform  duties  that  require  them  to  be unrestrained for short periods of time, provided they are not in close proximity to an open door. A29.4.19.2.  Except  for  primary  and  additional  aircrew  all  cabin  occupants  must  be seated  with  seat  belts  fastened  during  taxi,  initial  takeoff,  and  initial  approach  and landing. A29.4.20.  Power Required for Tactical Terminal Operations Training. A29.4.20.1.  Clear escape route – out of ground effect (OGE) hover power. A29.4.20.2.  Restricted escape route – OGE hover power plus 10 percent. A29.4.21.  Obstacle  Clearance  for  Tactical  Terminal  Operations  Training.  Horizontal obstacle clearance will be no less than 25 feet from the proprotor tip path plane. Shipboard operations to marked spot cleared for V-22 may be conducted with less clearance. A29.4.22.  Flare  and  Chaff  Guidance.  Dispense  flares  IAW  controlling  agency  procedures and  restrictions.  When  over  water,  dispense  flares  at  least  3  NM  from  any  surface  vessel, 326 AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 platform,  or  landmass.    Upon  next  landing,  deplane  a  crewmember  to  visually  inspect dispensers  to  ensure  that  there  are  no  hung  flares.  If  a  hung  flare  is  detected,  follow appropriate procedures. A29.4.23.  Simulated  Instrument  Flight.  The  use  of  a  hood  or  other  artificial  vision-restricting device is not authorized for any phase of flight unless IAW approved test plan. A29.4.24.  Emergency  Procedures.  Emergency  procedures  are  normally  practiced  in  the aircrew training device (ATD).  Do not retard ECL’s or fail any aircraft systems,  except as required during FCF’s.

AFI  11-401/AFMC  Sup  1  paragraph  1.11.1.2  designates  the Commandant of the USAF Test Pilot School (TPS) as the approval authority for TPS curriculum missions  conducted  in  non-USAF  aircraft.  TPS  uses  leased  sailplanes  (gliders)  to  support  the Soaring Program. A31.1.1.  Soaring.    TPS  operates  contractor-owned  glider  aircraft  in  support  of  the  TPS curriculum.  Glider  aircrew  consist  of  assigned  or  attached  military,  civil  service,  and contractor  pilots  who  are  trained  and  qualified  under  Title  14  of  the  Code  of  Federal Regulations  (14  CFR  61),  Certification:  Pilots,  Flight  Instructors,  and  Ground  Instructors. Operation  of  the  gliders  is  governed  by  14  CFR  91,  General  Operating  and  Flight  Rules. TPS Operating Instruction 11-4, Soaring contains specific guidance for administration of the glider  program.    Guidance  is  provided  for  aircrew  selection,  training,  mission  qualification and operating procedures.  AFI11-2FTV3  1 MARCH 2017 329 Attachment 32 OTHER AIRCRAFT OPERATING PROCEDURES A32.1.  General  Information.  There  are  numerous  aircraft  in  the  USAF  inventory  that  are fielded  and  fully  operational.    These  aircraft  occasionally  enter  AFMC  status,  primarily  while undergoing heavy maintenance (PDM) or extensive modifications.  AFMC does not maintain a standing  crew  force  to  operate  these  aircraft.   Instead,  they  are  flown  during  post maintenance/modification  check  flights  by  owning  unit  aircrew  on  a  TDY  basis  to  the maintenance  facility.    While  the  aircraft  is  flown  for  check  flight  purposes  and  while  under AFMC  control  (does  not  include  delivery  flight),  the  following  aircraft  may  be  operated  IAW published  AFI  11-2MDS  guidance  without  the  need  for  further  coordination  or  approval  from AFMC/A3V.  AFMC retains all waiver authority for any required item or issue involved in the check flight. A32.1.1.  Aircraft governed by this attachment: A32.1.1.1.  C-20 A32.1.1.2.  C-21 A32.1.1.3.
