Objectives. 1.5.1.  The PJ and CRO stan/eval program is divided into two core evaluation types and two other evaluation types to ensure appropriate qualification/certification and standardization of tasks and operations. 1.5.2.  Core  Evaluations.  The  two  types  of  core  evaluations  are  Aircrew  Qualification  and Mission Qualification. 1.5.3.  Aircrew  Qualification  Evaluation  (QUAL).  PJ/CRO  personnel  are  considered Specialized/Non-rated  Aircrew  IAW  AFI  11-202  V2  chapter  8  and  only  require  a  written QUAL  examination  to  establish  and  maintain  aircrew  qualification.    A  flight  phase evaluation  is  not  required  or  directed  and  all  documentation  procedures  for  PJ/CRO personnel will adhere to the guidance contained within Chapter 6 of this AFI. 1.5.4.  Mission Evaluation (MSN). PJ/CRO personnel are required to conduct an employment based mission evaluation in order to ensure individuals maintain mission standards IAW this AFI.  PJ and CROs should be evaluated to their highest mission qualification level. Mission qualification levels are Team Commander (TC), Team Member (TM), Element Leader (EL), and Team Leader (TL).The MSN evaluation is a full mission profile scenario encompassing all fundamental aspects of pre, during, and post mission tasks. 1.5.5.  Other Evaluation Types. In addition to the two Core Evaluations, (QUAL and MSN) there are two other types of evaluations. They are Task (TASK) and Instructor (INSTR). See Chapter 4 and 5 respectively for applicable guidance. 1.6.  Interim Changes/Revisions/Supplements.  Will be coordinated IAW AFI 33-360. 1.7.  Evaluator Responsibilities. 1.7.1.  Evaluators  must  be  seasoned  instructors  qualified  and  current  in  the  events  they  are evaluating.  They must be identified as Evaluators on the unit Commander‘s certified Letter of X‘s. 1.7.2.  Certified  evaluators  who  subsequently  gain  advanced  certifications  are  automatically certified to evaluate these new qualifications. 1.7.3.  Evaluators will use the evaluation criteria contained within each requirements chapter and applicable attachments to ensure standard and objective evaluations.  Evaluators will be thoroughly  familiar  with  the  prescribed  evaluation  criteria  and  be  the  Unit‘s  most experienced  instructors.    They  will  be  experts  on  evaluation  criteria,  evaluation  techniques, and documentation requirements.  They will assist and notify Stan/Eval with trend data and observed deficiencies in training.  See Attachment 3 for the minimum task requirements for MSN Evaluations. 1.7.4.  Prior  to  the  mission  briefings,  the  evaluator  will  brief  the  examinee  on  specific evaluation areas, purpose and conduct of the evaluation. AFI10-3502V2  30 APRIL 2012   9  1.7.5.  When  mission  requirements,  team  composition  requirements,  or  students  are  not available, the evaluator may serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee‘s instructional ability.  Except during initial evaluations, or when it is impossible or impractical to  evaluate  a  required  area,  the  evaluator  may  elect  to  evaluate  the  area(s)  by  an  alternate method  (simulator,  procedural  trainer,  or  verbal  examination)  following  guidance  in  para. 1.9., Verbal Evaluation of Sub-areas. 1.7.6.  During  an  actual  emergency,  the  evaluator  will  determine  when  to  terminate  an evaluation. 1.7.7.  The  evaluator  will  thoroughly  debrief  all  aspects  of  the  evaluation.  This  debrief  will include the overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified), and required additional training (if applicable). 1.7.8.  Once  an  evaluation  has  begun,  the  evaluator  will  document  the  results.  Evaluations will not be terminated or negated in order to avoid an unsatisfactory grade. 1.8.  Grading  Systems.  A two-tiered  grading  system is  used to  evaluate  and document  PJ and CRO  performance.    Individual  scores  are  recorded  for  QUAL  examinations  and  areas/subareas are graded for the MSN evaluation.  An overall qualification or certification is determined from the  compilation  of  the  individual  scores  or  areas/subareas  graded  (i.e.  Satisfactory  / Unsatisfactory). 1.8.1.  Area/Subarea  Grades.  The  required  event  tables  in  Attachment  3  establishes  areas and subareas to be evaluated during MSN or TASK evaluations - to include the appropriate grading  criteria  for  those  areas/subareas.    Areas/subareas  will  have  a  two-level  (S/U)  or three-level (S/S-/U) grading system. 1.8.1.1.  Satisfactory (S).  The desired level of performance.  The examinee demonstrated a satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed PJ or CRO duties within the prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission. 1.8.1.2.  Satisfactory  w/Comments  (S-).    Indicates  the  examinee  is  qualified/certified  to perform the assigned area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the evaluator. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed S- tolerances or jeopardize safety. 1.8.1.3.  Unsatisfactory  (U).    Indicates  a  breach  of  discipline,  performance  outside allowable parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely affected  mission  accomplishment  or  compromised  mission  safety.    An  examinee receiving an area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training.  When, in the judgment of the evaluator, additional training will not constructively improve examinee‘s performance, it is not  required.    In  this  case,  the  evaluator  must  thoroughly  debrief  the examinee. 1.8.2.  Critical  Area.  Critical  grading  areas  have  been  established  for  all  evaluations.  Critical areas are defined as those core areas, which if not performed to the ―S‖ level, could adversely  affect  the  qualification  of  a  PJ  or  CRO  and  result  in  loss  of  life  or  damage  to property. Grade all critical areas as either (S) or (U). 1.8.3.  Qualification Grades.  Overall evaluation performance is graded as follows:   10  AFI10-3502V2  30 APRIL 2012 1.8.3.1.  Satisfactory  (S).  The  PJ  or  CRO  demonstrated  desired  performance  and knowledge  of  procedures,  equipment  and  directives  within  tolerances  specified  in  the grading  criteria.    This  will  be  awarded  when  no  discrepancies  were  noted,  and  may  be awarded when discrepancies are noted if: 1.8.3.1.1.  All  discrepancies  noted  during  the  evaluation  were  cleared  during  the debrief of that evaluation. 1.8.3.1.2.  There  could  be  one  or  more  area(s)/subarea(s)  where  additional  training was assigned. 1.8.3.1.3.  A non-critical area/subarea grade of U may have been awarded. 1.8.3.1.4.  In  the  judgment  of  the  evaluator,  there  is  justification  based  on performance in all areas/subareas. 1.8.3.2.  Unsatisfactory  (U).  The  PJ  or  CRO  demonstrated  an  unacceptable  level  of safety, performance or knowledge and is considered unqualified. 1.8.3.2.1.  A  grade  of  U  awarded  in  a  critical  area  requires  an  overall  (U)  for  the evaluation. 1.8.3.2.2.  One  or  more  discrepancies  noted  during  the  evaluation  were  not  cleared during  the  debrief  of  that  evaluation  and  require  additional  training  prior  to  re-evaluation. 1.8.3.2.3.  An overall (U) can be awarded if, in the judgment of the evaluator, there is justification based on performance in one or more areas/subareas. 1.8.4.  Grading Instructions. 1.8.4.1.  Areas/subareas  not  applicable  to  the  unit  or  mission  need  not  be  performed; however, all areas/subareas performed will be graded. 1.8.4.2.  The  evaluator  will  compare  examinee  performance  for  each  required  area accomplished  during  the  evaluation  with  the  evaluation  criteria  provided  in  each  of  the corresponding  sections  and  assign  an  appropriate  grade.    Derive  the  overall  evaluation grade from the area grades based on observed events and tasks IAW this instruction. 1.8.4.3.  Evaluator  judgment  must  be  exercised  when  the  wording  of  areas  is  subjective and when specific situations are not covered. 1.8.4.4.  Evaluator judgment will be the determining factor in assigning the overall grade. 1.8.5.  Remedial  Action.  All  grades of S- or less require  action to  remedy the discrepancy and/or  deficiency  in  performance.    Remedial  action  includes  debriefing  the  discrepancy and/or assignment of additional training. 1.8.6.  Debriefed  Discrepancy.  Remedial  action  accomplished  during  debrief  of  the evaluation wherein the evaluator  provides the  discrepancy  and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to remedy the discrepancy. instruction  concerning 1.8.7.  Additional  Training.  Any  training  recommended  by  an  evaluator  to  remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation. AFI10-3502V2  30 APRIL 2012   11  1.8.7.1.  May  include  self-study,  ground  instruction,  or  live  scenario.  To  complete additional training, the examinee must demonstrate attainment of satisfactory knowledge or proficiency. 1.8.7.2.  If a PJ or CRO exceeds the allotted time for completion of additional training to meet  the  Re-Qualification  (RQ)  evaluation,  the  squadron  commander  will  review  the situation and direct appropriate action.  This will be documented IAW Chapter 5. 1.9.  Verbal Evaluation of Sub-areas. 1.9.1.  For initial/requalification evaluations, all required items must be performed by actual demonstration. 1.9.2.  For  periodic  evaluations,  when  it  is  impossible  or  impractical  to  evaluate  a  required area,  the  evaluator  may  elect  to  evaluate  the  area(s)  by  an  alternate  method  (procedural trainer, or verbal examination). Document why required area(s) were not evaluated as part of the  evaluation  and  the  alternate  method  of  evaluation  used  in  the  additional  comments paragraph of the AF Form 803, Report of Task Evaluations. 1.9.3.  The unit chief of stan/eval, decides if the evaluation is complete. 1.10.  Evaluation  Prefixes.  When  applicable,  the  following  prefixes  will  be  used  to  further describe each evaluation. 1.10.1.  Initial Evaluation.  Initial Evaluations are only required for the first QUAL and first MSN  evaluation  administered  to  the  examinee.    The  evaluation  is  documented  as  INIT QUAL or INIT MSN. NOTE: An INIT QUAL evaluation is a closed book test and will be accomplished prior to the individual‘s first flying event. 1.10.1.1.  INIT  QUAL  Evaluation.  INIT  QUAL  evaluations  will  be  accomplished  upon completion  of  IQT  IAW  AFI  10-3502V1,  PARARESCUE  AND  COMBAT  RESCUE OFFICER TRAINING, Chapter 2 and additional requirements IAW MAJCOM approved lesson plans or SOI‘s for the units primary assigned aircraft; this includes vertical lift and fixed wing ground training. 1.10.1.2.  INIT  MSN  Eval  (Vertical  lift/Fixed  wing).    INIT  MSN  evaluations  will  be accomplished  once  MQT  is  complete  IAW  AFI  10-3502V1  Chap  3  (if  required)  and additional  requirements  from  MAJCOM  /  unit SOPs.    Evaluations  will  be  conducted  in all unit assigned aircraft.  Units with no dedicated aircraft will assign a primary aircraft for  the  INIT  QUAL  and  INIT  MSN  evaluations.  Every  effort  will  be  made  to  qualify members on both airframes.  For subsequent or follow on evaluations see chapter 3.

TASK  Evaluation.  TASK  evaluations  are  used  to  provide  the  commander  with  feedback on individual skills or specific team mission capabilities through random evaluations of mission training  and  exercises.  A  TASK  evaluation  is  not  intended  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  a periodic evaluation.  TASK evaluations have no specific time requirements. 4.1.1.  TASK  evaluations  may  be  conducted  at  any  time.    Personnel  receiving  TASK evaluations  must  be  notified  prior  to  the  start  of  the  event.    Areas  found  to  be  substandard will  result  in  the  individual  being  unqualified  in  those  specific  tasks  and  documented  IAW Chapter  6.    Additional  training  in  the  substandard  task  or  tasks  will  be  given  and  a  re-qualification/certification evaluation is required prior to re-qualification/certification. 4.1.2.  PJ  and  CRO  evaluators  may  administer  evaluations  to  either  AFSC  for  similar  tasks (e.g., AIE, Jump Master, Instructor) only if the task, condition and standard for the event is identical. These will be documented as TASK evaluations (see Chapter 6). 4.1.3.  A TASK evaluation may be used to update a MSN evaluation expiration date provided all evaluation requirements are completed IAW Attachment 3.   18  AFI10-3502V2  30 APRIL 2012 Chapter 5 INSTRUCTOR EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS 5.1.

Units may supplement Table 7.1 with additional publications. 7.2.  Commander  Interest  Item  (CII).  CIIs  are  items  of  emphasis  of  existing  procedure(s) designed to mitigate or eliminate specific risks or trends. CIIs do not add to or amend established procedures. CIIs will be based on analysis of risks and trends from a variety of sources to include Safety  Investigation  Board  (SIB)  findings/recommendations,  safety  related  incidences,  trend analysis, deployed area of operations, and potential problems with equipment/procedures. 7.2.1.  SII(s)  should  be  maintained  and  managed  similar  to  Flight  Related  SIIs  detailed  in AFI 11-202V2 and MAJCOM supplements. 7.3.  Go/No-Go  Procedures.  Units  will  establish  a  positive  control  system  that  ensures  PJs  or CROs  have  completed  all  training  and  stan/eval  items  required  for  the  event  they  are participating in. 7.3.1.  As a minimum, the Go/No Go system will monitor: 7.3.1.1.  The currency events from AFI 10-3502V1.   26  AFI10-3502V2  30 APRIL 2012 7.3.1.2.

Units  will  define  and  publish  their  positive  control  system  in  the  unit  supplement  to this instruction. 7.4.  Supplementary  Evaluations.  Complete  IAW  AFI  11-202V2,  para.  9.4.  and  MAJCOM Sup. 7.5.  Stan/Eval Board (SEB).  IAW AFI 11-202V2, MAJCOM and unit supplements. 7.6.  Stan/Eval Visits.  HHQ Stan/Eval Staffs may visit units during the administration of formal inspections, Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs) or in an informal capacity, as specified in MAJCOM Supplements.  MAJCOM  PJ  and  CRO  FMs  should  be  present  for  formal  ASEVs.    Additional unique CRO and PJ ASEV formal inspection requirements are listed below: 7.6.1.  The QUAL  evaluation will be administered  IAW Chapter 2 to  100% of available PJ and CRO personnel. 7.6.2.  The unit will receive  fixed wing, vertical lift and/or  ground mission MSN evaluations based on TC, TM, EL, and TL manning, available supporting resources, and unit METLs. 7.6.3.  If  available,  100%  of  OJT  and  ITEF  records  will  be  inspected  to  validate  unit capability and individual qualifications to accomplish assigned taskings. 7.6.4.  Inspection evaluation support will be coordinated through the OGV or Unit CRO and PJ Stan/Eval section. 7.7.  Unit  Supplemental  Examinations  (optional).  Each OGV or CCV function may  conduct supplemental  testing  for  all  PJs  or  CROs.  The  intent  of  this  testing  is  to  evaluate  additional knowledge  beyond  the  scope  of  required  periodic  exams,  such  as  a  cross-section  of  general knowledge,  tactical/threat  knowledge,  and/or  operational  procedures,  etc.,  to  determine  if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit (e.g. 3-3.Guardian Angel).  This exam may be open or closed book, but will not count as a required periodic exam, nor will a periodic exam satisfy the requirement for a supplemental exam. Units will describe this program in the unit supplement to this instruction, to include procedures for failed exams. 7.8.  Review  Board  Process.  Review  boards  are  designed  to  look  at  the  overall  evaluation  or training  process  to  deliver  an  impartial  judgment.  Review  boards  look  at  the  trainee  and  the training process to see if the failure is individual, institutional, or procedural. 7.8.1.  Convene a Review Board when: 7.8.1.1.  Directed by the commander. 7.8.1.2.  A PJ or CRO fails a re-evaluation/re-certification. 7.8.1.3.  After any incident that compromised safety or resulted in injury to personnel or damage to equipment through negligence or violation of directives. 7.8.1.4.  A review board is not required in situations where personnel do not yet hold the AFSC of PJ or CRO. AFI10-3502V2  30 APRIL 2012   27  7.9.  Composition of Review Boards.  CCV conducts the review board for their specific AFSC.   EXCEPTION:  For SQ/CC, OGV Personnel, or personnel  attached to the squadron (i.e. HHQ) the OG/CC will conduct and determine the composition of the review board.  If a primary board member  cannot  be  present,  the  commander  will  designate  an  alternate.    The  alternate  will typically  be  the  next  senior  ranking  member  of  the  AFSC  involved.  The  reviewer‘s  direct supervisor  may  observe  the  board  proceeding;  however,  he  will  not  be  a  voting  member.    The commander may observe the proceedings as a non-voting member since the board recommends action to the commander. 7.9.1.  CRO Review Board will consist of the CRO assigned to CCV, the operations officer, and the CRO assigned to OGV (or other CRO designated by OG/CC). 7.9.2.  PJ Review  Board  will  consist  of  the  PJ  assigned  to  CCV,  the  operations  officer,  the senior PJ assigned to the squadron, and the PJ assigned to OGV (or other PJ designated by the OG/CC). 7.10.  Review  Board  Actions.  The  board  will  evaluate  and  analyze  all  factors  bearing  on  a situation  and  provide  the  commander  with  recommendations.  Recommendations  may  include removal of an advanced skill qualification, additional supervised training, or recommendation for removal from  the AFSC. Board findings of personnel  retained in  the AFSC will be maintained on  file  for  18  months.    If  AFSC  removal  is  recommended,  the  unit  training  manager  will coordinate  required  actions  with  the  base  training  office  for  guidance  and  documentation management procedures. 7.10.1.  Actions resulting in the recommendation for removal of an AFSC will be forwarded to the next higher headquarters or MAJCOM level as appropriate. 7.11.  Trend  Program.  Units will establish and maintain a trend program  designed to  identify areas requiring attention, monitoring or correction. 7.11.1.  Scope will include trend analysis of all evaluations. 7.11.2.  When  trends  are  noted,  recommend  corrective  action  and  assign  an  OPR/Office  of Collateral Responsibility (OCR). 7.11.3.  Report  trends  and  status  to  the  OG/CC  during  the  SEB  until  closed  (see  AFI  11-202V2 Attachment 2). Maintain an archive of trend data for at least one year from the date the trend was identified. 7.12.  Briefing  Facilities.  Mission  planning/briefing  materials  will  be  available  in  either  the mission planning area or mission briefing rooms (specific location as determined by the unit) and IAW AFI 11-202 V2 and MAJCOM supplement. 7.13.  AF  Form  847  Program.  AF  Form  847s  are  vital  to  enhance  operational  efficiency, correct  content  errors,  or  recommend  improved  procedures.  Recommendation  for  Air  Force Publication  improvements  will  be  IAW  AFI  11-202V2,  AFI  11-215  (Chapter  9,  10,  and Attachment 3), and applicable MAJCOM Supplements.      28   AFI10-3502V2  30 APRIL 2012 7.14.  Electronic  Data  Storage.  Units  may  use  electronic  database  files  for  record  keeping, trend analysis, printing of standard forms, etc.  MAJCOMs will establish standards for archiving and  inspection  of  electronic  files.  Units  not  in  compliance  will  maintain  hard-copy  records  as directed in this instruction.  HERBERT J.
