This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements and training  sup-port  resources  for  AFSC  3N1X1,  3N2X1  and  3N1X1Z.  In  addition,  it  identifies  3-skill  level training requirements for the award of AFSC 3N1X1, 3N2X1 and 3N1X1Z, minimum core task requirements for AFSC 3N1X1 and 3N1X1Z and authority for the award of the AFSC 3N2X1    7-skill level.    2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; supervisors use both parts of the plan to manage and control training within the career field.  2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression  infor-mation, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C  associ-ates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other);  Section D indicates resource constraints; Section E identifies 3N1XX specialty shredouts.  2.2. Part II includes the following:  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and identifies duties, tasks, and technical references to support training, standardized audition requirements, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training (3-skill level) and core tasks.  Section B identifies optional support materials.  3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive  effec-tive and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career.  This plan will enable us to  train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part  II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  4 ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS  EXPLAINED Air Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS).  A comprehensive task list that describes a particular job type or duty position.  The AFJQS is used by supervisors to document task quali-fications.  The tasks in an AFJQS are common to all persons serving in the described duty  po-sition. Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP).  A CFETP is a comprehensive,  multi-purpose document encapsulating the entire spectrum of education and training for a career  field. It outlines a logical growth plan, including training resources, and is designed to make  career field training identifiable, to eliminate duplication, and to ensure that training is budget  defensi-ble. Continuation Training.  Additional training, exceeding requirements, with emphasis on present or future duty assignments, which is provided to individuals with limited experience in a specific discipline. Core Task.  A task identified by career field managers as a minimum qualification requirement within an Air Force specialty or duty position. Enlisted Specialty Training (EST).  A mix of formal training (technical school) and informal training (on-the-job) to qualify and upgrade airmen in each skill level of a specialty. Instructional  System  Development  (ISD).  A  deliberate  and  orderly,  but  flexible  process  for planning, developing, implementing, and managing instructional systems.  It ensures personnel are taught in a cost efficient way the knowledge, skills, and attitudes essential for successful job performance. Job Qualification Training.  Training that becomes necessary when personnel transfer from one duty position to another, the unit’s mission changes, or at any time when new techniques, procedures, or the need for increased productivity occurs. Life-cycle Education and Training Requirements.  A comprehensive education and training program that identifies the task and knowledge performance requirements an individual will need throughout an entire career. Occupational Survey Report (OSR).  A detailed report showing the results of an occupational survey of tasks performed within a particular AFS. On-the-Job Training (OJT).  Hands-on, over-the-shoulder training conducted to certify  per-sonnel  in  both  upgrade  (skill  level  award)  and  job  qualification  (duty  position  certification) training. Optimal Training.  The ideal combination of training settings resulting in the highest levels of proficiency on specified performance requirements within the minimum time possible. 5             Qualification Training Package (QTP).  An instructional package designed for use at the unit to qualify, or aid qualification, in a duty position or program, or on a piece of equipment.  It may be printed, computer-based, or in other audiovisual media. Resource Constraints.  Resource deficiencies, such as money, facilities, time, manpower, and equipment that preclude desired training from being delivered. Shredout.  An alphabetical identifier appended to an AFS that serves to discriminate between specific specialties within an AFS. Specialty Training Standard (STS).  An Air Force publication that an Air Force specialty in terms of tasks and knowledge that airman in that  specialty may be expected to perform or to know on the job, and identifies the training provided to achieve a 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level within a specific AFS.  The STS assures uniformity in task and knowledge accomplishment by all airmen throughout  a  career  field.  It  further  serves  as  a  contract  between  Air Education  and  Training Command  and  the  functional  user  to  show  the overall  training  requirements  for  an  Air  Force Specialty Code (AFSC) in both technical training schools and OJT environments. Standard.  An exact value, a physical entity, or an abstract concept, established and defined by authority, custom, or common consent to serve as a reference, model, or rule in measuring  quan-tities or qualities, establishing practices or procedures, or evaluating results. Subject Matter Experts.  Those individuals within an AFS who are determined to be thoroughly knowledgeable of the scope of the various disciplines encompassed by that specialty. Training Requirements Analysis.  A detailed analysis of knowledge and skill tasks for a  par-ticular AFS to be included in the training decision process. Upgrade Training (UGT).  Formal and/or informal training which leads to attainment of higher skill level proficiency. Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW).  A forum of Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) functional managers and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) that determines career ladder training requirements. 6          Section A - General Information 1. Purpose of the CFETP.  This CFETP provides information that the Air Force Career Field Functional Manager (AFCFM), career field managers, commanders, training specialists,  supervi-sors and trainers need to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field  training program.  It outlines the training that individuals in this AFS should receive in order to  develop and progress throughout their career life-cycle.  It identifies initial skill requirements (a  standard-ized  audition  process  for  entry  into  the  career  field  and  3-skill  level  attainment  requirements while assigned to the Air Force basic military training environment), and delineates  follow-on upgrade, qualification, and proficiency training.  Upgrade training includes all  mandatory qualifi-cation requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels.  Qualification  training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to prepare an airman for a specific  duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It  is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.  Proficiency  training is addi-tional training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge   beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP also serves the following purposes: 1.1. As a management tool to plan, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program, and to assist supervisors in identifying training at the appropriate point in an individual's career. 1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty. 1.3. Lists mandatory and optional training material available in the specialty. 1.4. Identifies resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training process. 2. Uses of the CFETP.  The plan will be used by supervisors at all levels to ensure that  com-prehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty. 2.1. Career field managers and training specialists will work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide identified training, and will conduct an annual review of the CFETP to ensure currency and accuracy. 2.2. Career field managers, commanders, training specialists, supervisors and trainers will ensure  their  training  programs  complement  the  CFETP  mandatory  initial,  upgrade,  and proficiency requirements. 2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in Part II, Section A of this CFETP. 3. Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  Also, the AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy.  MAJCOM repre-sentatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training. 7            Section B - Career Progression and Information Specialty Descriptions. 4.

Specialty  shredouts  acknowledge  the  distinctive  characteristics  of  each  musical discipline.  Part II of this CFETP describes the specific knowledge and performance tasks   re-quired of each separate musical discipline.  Specialty shredouts are designated for AFSC 3N1X1 personnel only  (Note: Air National Guard bandsmen use the Z-shredout for                classifica-tion and assignment purposes; however, ANG bandsmen use the applicable shredout for  training purposes  (i.e. An ANG clarinetist is classified and assigned as a 3N1X1Z and uses the  3N1X1A STS for upgrade training).  AFSC 3N2X1 personnel are not authorized specialty  shredouts and maintenance of this formal training plan to document completion of knowledge   and performance tasks is not required.  19    Part II Section A - Specialty Training Standard 1. Implementation.  This Specialty Training Standard (STS) shall be used by 3NXX1 personnel to document certification and award of the Apprentice (3-skill level) through the standardized audition process and completion of the Basic Military Training School (BMTS) Drum and Bugle Corps training program. 1.1. Regional Bands (AFSC 3N1X1).  This STS will be used by 3N1X1 personnel to document certification and award of the Journeyman (5-skill level) and the Craftsman (7-skill level).  Man-ager/Superintendent Continuation Training (CT) does not require formal documentation.    For standardized audition and documentation procedures refer to Part II, Section A, paragraph  2.7.1. 1.2. Premier Bands (AFSC 3N2X1).  The standardized audition and training requirements  de-signed to assure maintenance of performance and readiness standards of The USAF Band (AFSC 3N2X1) are developed and maintained separately by the  premier band commander. 1.3. Air National Guard Bands (AFSC 3N1X1Z).  ANG Band members achieve the  Appren-tice (3-skill level) through the standardized audition process, completion of the Basic  Military Training School (BMTS) Drum and Bugle Corps training program, and follow-on training.  Fol-low-on training consists of musical training accomplished by using one of two  training options selected by the band commander at the time of enlistment.  Both options utilize  the Band Jour-neyman (5-skill level) tasks in the CFETP.  ANG Band commanders may  substitute repertoire of similar difficulty for the standardized audition process and follow-on  training. For standard-ized audition and documentation procedures refer to Part II, Section A,  paragraph 2.7.1. 1.3.1. Option #1 - Training with an active duty USAF band.  This training option consists of up to 120 days of training with a USAF band.  The ANG band commander determines the exact length of training.  ANG band commanders coordinate and obtain approval from the USAF band located in their geographic Area of Responsibility (AOR) prior to the individual attending basic training.  The individual reports to the USAF band directly from BMTS and is trained by  mem-bers of that band. 1.3.2. Option #2 - College Enrollment.  This training option consists of training at a regionally accredited college or university for one academic term (approx. 120 days).  Some colleges use a semester system, while others use a quarter system.  Both are acceptable for ANG training.  The ANG band commander ensures that the appropriate courses have been selected and that the  indi-vidual is working on the areas contained in the Band Journeyman (5-skill level) section of  the CFETP. 2. Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:  2.1.  Identifies the specific trainee to whom this copy of the CFETP applies, and provides for name(s) and initial(s) of the trainee, trainers and certifying official(s). 2.2.  Includes a Proficiency Code Key that defines task, knowledge, and subject performance levels, and can be used as a guide for interpreting actual performance depth required of the 20           trainee during Apprentice (3-skill level), Journeyman (5-skill level), and Craftsman (7-skill level) training. 2.3.  Lists in Column 1 the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties at the 3-, 5-, 7- and 9-skill level AFSC in the 3N1XX Career Field. These are based on an analysis of the duties in the Specialty Description.  Task statements are numbered sequentially i.e., 1.1., 1.2., 2.1., 2.2., etc. 2.4.  Lists in Column 2 the skill level at which specialty-wide core task training requirements are accomplished. 2.5.  Provides  certification  for  OJT.  Column  3  is  used  to  record  completion  of  tasks  and knowledge  training  requirements.  Use  automated  training  management  systems  to  document technician  qualifications,  if  available.  Task  certification  must  show  a  certification/completed  date.  At a minimum, use the following column designator: (Training Complete, Certifier   Ini-tials). On-the-job training certification should be oriented towards certifying individuals on     the items identified as core tasks. Being certified on a core task in this section requires the trainee  to be certified in any tasks and subtasks from the other sections that may apply. When the trainee has been certified on all tasks related to a core task and demonstrates the ability to bring all  ele-ments together for an acceptable product, the trainee may be signed off on the core task. 2.6.  Shows formal training proficiency requirements.  Column 4 shows the level of competency (Proficiency Code) to be demonstrated by the candidate as a result of training on the task and/or knowledge  requirement.  (Apprentice  [3-skill  level]  proficiency  codes  are  prescribed  by  the standardized audition process and completion of the BMTS Drum and Bugle Corps training  pro-gram.) 2.7.  Becomes a Job Qualification Standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in an AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201. When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply: 2.7.1.  Documentation.  Document and certify completion of training. Identify duty position  re-quirements  by circling  the  subparagraph number  next  to  the  task statement. As  a  minimum, complete the following columns in Part 2 of the CFETP: Training Completed, Trainee Initials, Trainer Initials and Certifier Initials (if applicable). An AFJQS may be used in lieu of Part II of the CFETP only upon approval of the AFCFM. NOTE: The AFCFM may supplement these minimum documentation procedures as needed or deemed necessary for their career field. 2.7.1.1.  Converting from Old CFETP. Use the new CFETP to identify and certify all past and current qualifications. For those tasks previously certified and required in the current duty  po-sition, evaluate current qualifications and, when verified, recertify using current date as completion date and enter certifier’s initials. For previous certification on tasks not required in the current duty position, carry forward only the previous completion dates. If and when these tasks become a duty position requirement, recertify with current date and certifier’s initials. 2.7.1.1.1.  For core and critical tasks previously certified and required in the current duty position, evaluate current qualifications and when verified, recertify using current date as completion date, and enter trainee’s and certifier’s initials. 21                     2.7.1.1.2.  For non-core and non-critical tasks previously certified and required in the current duty position, evaluate current qualifications and when verified, recertify using current date, as completion date and enter trainee’s and trainer’s initials. 2.7.1.1.3.  When transcribing previous certification for tasks not required in the current duty position, carry forward only the previous completion date of certification (not the initials of another person). If and when transcribed tasks become duty position requirements, recertify using standard certification procedures. 2.7.1.1.4.  The person whose initials appear in the trainer or certifier block during the transcription process must meet the requirements of their respective roles. 2.7.1.1.5.  Upon completion of the transcription process, give the old CFETP to the member. 2.7.1.2.  Decertification and Recertification.  When an airman is found to be unqualified on a  task previously certified for his or her position, the supervisor lines through the previous  certifi-cation or deletes previous certification when using automated system. Appropriate remarks  are entered on the AF Form 623A, On-the-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to the  reason for decertification. The individual is recertified (if required) either by erasing the old  entries and writing in the new or by using water based correction fluid (if the entries were made  in ink) over the previously certified entry. 2.7.2.  Training Standard.  Tasks are trained and qualified to the go/no go level.  Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy,  timeli-ness, and correct use of procedures. 2.7.2.1.  Standardized Audition Process.  IAW AFI36-2002 entry into the Air Force band career field  is  initiated  by  a  standardized  audition.  As  such,  the  training  life-cycle  begins  with  the standardized  audition.  Standardized  auditions  will  be  documented  by  shredout  using  musical tasks for 3-level certification specified in the Specialty Training Standard pages 27-52 (for  ex-ample, a 3N1X1A audition is accomplished by completing the proficiency requirements on  page 27, column 4A).  Document standardized audition and completion of BMTS in the STS to certify technical school equivalency.  If applicant will be assigned to a different base forward  STS to gaining unit.  IAW AFI36-2002, band officials document successful auditions on an AF  Form 485. 2.7.2.1.1.  A  Band  Commander  may  waive  a  required  proficiency  code  if  an  auditionee demonstrates sufficient ability and potential to accomplish upgrade training in requisite time. Band officials document the waiver on an AF Form 623A, On-the-Job Training Record  Continua-tion Sheet. 2.7.2.2.  A BMTS Instructor certifies completion of the Drum and Bugle Corps program upon successful completion of Basic Military Training. 2.7.2.3.  Decertification and Recertification.  When an airman is found to be unqualified on a  task previously certified for his or her position, the supervisor lines through the previous  certifi-cation or deletes previous certification when using automated system. Appropriate remarks  are 22 entered on an AF Form 623A, On-the-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to the  reason for decertification. The individual is recertified (if required) either by erasing the old  entries and writing in the new or by using water based correction fluid (if the entries were made  in ink) over the previously certified entry. 2.7.2.4.  Downgrading and Withdrawing AFSC Procedures.  Downgrade and withdrawal of AFSC is done IAW AFI36-2101 Chapter 4. 3. Responsibilities.  The supervisor, trainer, and trainee are each responsible for the accuracy of this document.  The following requirements also apply: 3.1.  In  order  to  fulfill  both  musical  and  administrative  requirements  prescribed  in  the  STS, trainees in both 5- and 7-skill level training will normally perform administrative tasks as well as upgrade training.  However, trainees may be temporarily removed from their primary  adminis-trative duty assignments and reassigned to selected training positions to fulfill all training  re-quirements (When certification of all Core Tasks is complete, trainees are reassigned to  adminis-trative duty positions).  Circle the appropriate item in Column 1 to identify the current,  training duty position. 3.2.  Trainees are trained, evaluated, and certified on the tasks (both musical and non-musical) listed in Column 1.  The fully certified trainee can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for  accuracy and timeliness.  Skill level certification is  accomplished only by band officers. 3.3.  All Core Tasks listed in Part II of the STS are required for certification.  This STS is assembled so that the Core Tasks list contains both musical and administrative training re-quired of all trainees.  Specific shredouts are listed below:   Suffix Portion of AFSC to which Related A.…………………………………………………………………………………………...Clarinet B.......................................................................................................................................Saxophone C...........................................................................................................................................

In  addition,  each  required Core  Task is  documented  by  annotating the  initials  of  the Trainee, Trainer, and Certifying Official. 3.3.2.  Supervisors schedule OJT according to work center operational requirements, trainer and task certifier availability, logic and training opportunities.  Notionally, the Trainee should receive one lesson each week.  If musical performance lessons are not practical during TDY status,  ac-complish administrative performance requirements as appropriate.  Each lesson is documented on the AF Form 3029, Lesson Assignment and Evaluation, and filed in the member’s AF Form 623, Training Record. 3.3.3.  Certifying  Officials  are  authorized  to  require  trainees  to  perform  only  the  performance tasks described in Column 2 of the STS, Part II.  Trainees are expected to use supplemental texts, methods, and materials provided in Section B of the STS, Part II, or texts, methods, and   materi-als prescribed by private instructors and approved by certifying officials, to supplement  training throughout the formal training cycle.  Bands are  authorized to pay for the cost of private training from civilian teachers and institutions for band members. 3.4.  Recommendations.  Report unsatisfactory performance or progression of individual trainees on AF Form 623.  Report inadequacies of and suggest corrections to this STS through channels t o  AFCFM.
