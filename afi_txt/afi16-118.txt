Overview.  With  the  rise  of  PRC  influence  in  the  international  community  and  the increasing  capabilities  of  the  Chinese  military,  Air  Force  military-to-military  relationship  with the  People’s  Liberation  Army  (PLA),  the  People’s  Liberation  Army  Navy  (PLAN),  and  the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) is becoming more crucial than before.  AFPD 16-1  establishes  the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  International  Affairs,  (SAF/IA)  is responsible  for  oversight  and  advocacy  of  Air  Force  international  programs  and  policies,  to include visits of foreign officials to Air Force installations.  AFPD 16-1 also establishes SAF/IA as the Air Force international affairs focal point for Department of Defense (DoD), Joint Staff, and  other  Military  Departments.    Accordingly,  this  Instruction  provides  guidance  for  all  Air Force  personnel  hosting  and  supporting  visits  by  PRC  personnel,  as  well  as  for  all  Air  Force personnel  visiting  the  PRC  or  otherwise  coming  in  contact  with  PRC  personnel.    The coordination of Air Force effort ensures appropriate support is provided to the person coming in contact with PRC personnel, and ensures that all USAF conduct is based upon the principles as laid out by the official DoD policy on the PRC.  The success of these visits, whether US or PRC-led, directly affects relationships between the US and the PRC, as well as our relationships with our  allies  and  partners,  and  is  thereby  important  in  support  of  national  and  regional  politico-military objectives. 1.1.1.  This  Instruction  also  covers  contact  by  USAF  personnel  with  personnel  of  the HKSAR of the PRC. 1.1.2.  This  Instruction  implements  DoDI  C-2000.23  and  DoDI  S-2000.24,  which  provide DoD guidance on contact by all DoD personnel with the PRC and HKSAR, respectively.   4  AFI16-118  5 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  USAF  Personnel.  All  USAF  personnel  coming  into  contact  with  PRC  or  HKSAR personnel either via traveling or hosting must contact SAF/IARP, for guidance no later than 60 days before contact with PRC or HKSAR personnel as per the Foreign Clearance Guide.  (T-O) 2.2.  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  International  Affairs.  SAF/IA  (or  the designee SAF/IARP) oversees support to all USAF personnel coming into contact with PRC or HKSAR  personnel  (unless  otherwise  provided  by  competent  authority)  and  ensures  that  all USAF  contact  with  PRC  or  HKSAR  personnel  will  be  in  accordance  to  the  policy,  principles, and objectives as laid out by the DoD.  Specifically, SAF/IA will: 2.2.1.  Determine  if  the  USAF  personnel’s  contact  is  in  accordance  with  USAF  policy  for contacts  with  the  PRC  and  does  not  include  prohibited  contacts  which  may  involve:    force projection  operations,  nuclear  operations,  advanced  combined-arms  and  joint  combat operations,  advanced  logistical  operations,  chemical  and  biological  defense  and  other capabilities  related  to  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  surveillance  and  reconnaissance operations, joint war-fighting experiments and other activities related to  a transformation in warfare,  military  space  operations,  other  advanced  capabilities  of  the  armed  forces,  arms sales  or  military-related  technology  transfers,  release  of  classified  or  restricted  information, and access to a DoD laboratory. 2.2.1.1.  Determine  if  USAF  personnel’s  contact  requires  a  Defense  Contact  Proposal (DCP)  to  be  submitted  to  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Asian  and  Pacific Security Affairs (ASD(APSA)). 2.2.1.2.  In the case a DCP is deemed necessary, provide the specific PRC/HKSAR DCP to the USAF personnel for completion. 2.2.1.3.  Assist  in  the  review/editing  process  of  the  DCP,  and  submit  to  ASD(APSA) through  OSD(Policy)  and  Joint  Staff  no  later  than  45  days  before  contact  with  PRC  or HKSAR personnel. 2.2.1.4.  Provide updates on the status of the DCP as necessary to USAF personnel. 2.2.1.5.  Ensure  USAF  personnel  develop  an  After-Action  Report  (AAR)  following completion of contact, for submission to ASD(APSA). 2.2.2.  Coordinate with USAF MAJCOMs to develop an Annual Mil-to-Mil Contact Plan for submission  to  OSD  in  the  month  of  September,  which  better  facilitates  the  OSD  approval process for the next calendar year.
