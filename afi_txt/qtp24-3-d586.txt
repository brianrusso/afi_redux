The  operator  needs  to  consider  the  combined weight of the sewer pipe cleaning vehicle and the load.  This will affect the following:  5.4.1.1.1.1.  Operator’s ability to stop.  Do not tailgate the vehicle in front.  Allow more distance between vehicles in order to increase reaction time.  5.4.1.1.1.2.  Vehicle’s ability to  accelerate/follow the flow of traffic.  Accelerate smoothly  and  gradually  so  the  truck  does  not  jerk.  Rough  acceleration  causes unnecessary, premature mechanical damage to the vehicle’s drive train.  Maintain a safe speed (typically 5 miles per hour (mph) below the posted speed limit).  5.4.1.1.2.   Downgrades/upgrades.  The operator will use lower gears more frequently to climb hills or mountains with increasing grade steepness, length and/or heavy load weight.  Plan ahead to identify downgrades/upgrades on the route of travel.  If possible, talk to other drivers who are familiar with the grades to find out what speeds are safe.  When  encountering  downgrades/upgrades  as  described,  the  operator  will  need  to address:  5.4.1.1.2.1.  Speed.    On  downgrades,  gravity  causes  the  speed  of  the  vehicle  to increase.  The operator must select an appropriate safe speed, use a low gear, and proper braking techniques.  The operator must go slow enough so as to not overheat the truck brakes.  5.4.1.1.2.2.  Stopping.  If the brakes become too hot, they may start to “fade”.  This means  the  operator  will  need  to  apply  the  brakes  harder  and  harder  to  acquire equivalent stopping power. 5.4.1.1.3.   Sharp turns.  Slow down before entering the turn.  During the turn, avoid sharp sudden movements with the steering wheel.  This reduces the chance of shifting the load in the tank, and also prevents the possibility of tipping over due to the higher center of gravity. 5.4.1.1.4.   Surroundings.    Operating  a  sewer  pipe  cleaning  vehicle  requires  the operator’s constant attention.  Many situations can be avoided by simply paying close attention  to  the  surrounding  conditions.    Road  signs  such  as  “steep  grade”,  “low overhead clearance”, “sharp turn ahead”, and special speed limits  are posted for the driver’s safety. 5.4.1.1.5.   Size.  The operator must take into account, the sewer pipe cleaning vehicle and load when operating the vehicle.     5.4.2.  Backing.  5.4.2.1.  Always use a trained spotter and hand signals.  5.4.2.2.    Back slowly and keep the spotter in view at all times.  If the operator loses sight of the spotter, the operator must immediately stop the vehicle.  5.4.2.3.  See AFMAN 24-306 for standard AF spotter hand signals and additional guidance on spotter safety.  5.4.3.  Parking.  5.4.3.1.  Apply the parking brake.  Chock the wheels.  5.4.3.2.  Set cones when parked.  5.4.4.  Tire changing safety.  5.4.4.1.  Consider  where  the  vehicle  is  located.    If  on  a  bridge,  curve,  road  with  no shoulder, etc.; it is safer to move a vehicle on a flat tire to a safe location. 5.4.4.2.  Find a location with a firm and level surface for the jack. 5.4.4.3.  Turn on the four-way flashers. 5.4.4.4.  Place warning triangles or flares. 5.4.4.5.  Chock the wheels.  If changing a front tire, chock  the rear wheels.  If changing a rear tire, chock the front wheels. 5.4.4.6.  Place the vehicle in “Park” if it has an automatic transmission and low gear if it has a standard shift. 5.4.4.7.  Ensure the jack is rated for the weight of the vehicle.  Ensure proper placement of jack. 5.4.4.8.  If available, use jack stands after lifting the vehicle.  Once the vehicle is lifted; never at any time get under the vehicle. 5.4.4.9.  Before removing lug nuts, ensure lug wedges are loose (double check). 5.4.4.10.   After  changing  the  tire,  return  the  jack  and  lug  wrench  to  the  location recommended by the manufacturer (keep them from becoming flying projectiles and makes them available for future tire changes).           5.4.4.11.   Secure the damaged tire and once it is repaired, return the spare tire back to its proper location.  5.4.5.  Off-road driving.  For more information on off-road driving and safe vehicle operation guidance, refer to AFMAN 24-306.  5.5. Vehicle Operation.  5.5.1.  Driving Characteristics.  5.5.2.  General Vehicle Operation.  5.5.2.1.  Sewer pipe cleaning vehicles are equipped with either one or two power take-off (PTO) controls.  Check the vehicle operator’s manual to identify the configuration of the specific vehicle.  5.5.2.2.  Position the vehicles at the work site and set the park brake.  Place traffic cones at the front and rear of the vehicle.  Be sure to position the vehicle next to the mahhole in the direction in which the cleaner jet rodder snake head will travel.  5.5.2.3.  Engage the PTO allowing operation of the water pump.  Once PTO is engaged, drop  the  gearshift  lever  to  drive,  allowing  engine  to  be  throttled  from  the  truck’s  rear.  Higher engine revolutions per minute (RPMs) produce greater pressure to come out of the end of the hose.  5.5.2.4.  Slowly  feed  the  cleaner  jet  rodder  snake  into  the  utitliy  hole.    Adjust  the  reel speed, as necessary, to allow the snake to maneuver through the sewer pipe.  5.5.2.5.  Turn on the water valve to allow water to flow through the snake  5.5.2.6.  Feed the hose from the reel using the the controls.  5.5.2.7.  Continue sewer cleaning operations until the snake head reaches the next manhole or until the hose runs out.  5.5.2.8.  Once the sewer pipe is cleared, use the controls to recover the hose back onto the hose reel.  5.5.2.9.  Be sure to wash the hose and reel before parking the vehicle at the end of the duty day.  5.5.3.  Vacuum system.  5.5.3.1.  Refer to the operator’s manual for instruction on operating the vacuum system.  Note:    You  may  wish  to  develop  specific  guidance  to  include  with  this  lesson  plan  on  system component operations for assigned vehicles.  Section 6—EXPLANATION AND DEMONSTRATION.  6.1.

Note:  Check that the parking brakes are on and/or wheels chocked.  The operator may have to raise the hood, tilt the cab (secure loose things so they don't fall and break something), or open the engine compartment door.   Check the following: o  Engine oil level. o  Coolant level in radiator; condition of hoses. o  Power steering fluid level; hose condition (if so equipped). o  Windshield washer fluid level. o  Battery fluid level, connections and tie-downs (battery may be located elsewhere). o  Automatic transmission fluid level (may require engine to be running). o  Check belts for tightness and excessive wear (alternator, water pump, air compressor)--learn how much "give" the belts should have when adjusted right. o  Leaks in the engine compartment (fuel, coolant, oil, power steering fluid, hydraulic fluid, battery fluid). o  Cracked, worn electrical wiring insulation. 3.  Start Engine and Inspect Inside the Cab Get in and Start Engine   Make sure parking brake is on.   Put gearshift in neutral (or park if automatic).  Start engine; listen for unusual noises. o  If equipped, check the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) indicator lights.  Light on dash should come on and then turn-off.  If it stays on the ABS is not working properly. Note:  For trailers only, if the yellow light on the left rear of the trailer stays on, the ABS is not working properly.   Look at the gauges. o  Oil pressure. Should come up to normal within seconds after engine is started. o  Air pressure. Pressure should build from 50 to 90 psi within 3 minutes. Build air pressure to governor cut-out (usually around 120 – 140 psi.  Know the vehicle’s requirements. o  Ammeter and/or voltmeter. Should be in normal range(s). o  Coolant temperature. Should begin gradual rise to normal operating range. o  Engine oil temperature. Should begin gradual rise to normal operating range. o  Warning lights and buzzers. Oil, coolant, charging circuit warning, and antilock brake system lights should go out right away.   Check Condition of Controls. Check all of the following for looseness, sticking, damage, or improper setting: o  Steering wheel. o  Clutch. o  Accelerator (gas pedal). o  Brake controls. o  Foot brake. o  Parking brake. o  Retarder controls (if vehicle has them). o  Transmission controls. o  Interaxle differential lock (if vehicle has one). o  Horn(s). o  Windshield wiper/washer. o  Lights. o  Headlights. o  Dimmer switch. o  Turn signal. o  Four-way flashers. o  Parking – clearance – identification – marker switch (switches).   Check mirrors and windshield. o  Inspect mirrors and windshield for cracks, dirt, illegal stickers, or other obstructions to seeing clearly.
