The Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the fuels specialty.  The CFETP provides fuels personnel a clear career path to success and instills rigor in all aspects of career field training. NOTE:  Civilians occupying fuels positions will use Part II of this CFETP to support duty position qualification training.  Additionally, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) career paths differ from career paths depicted in this document.  They may develop career paths that accurately describe the life-cycle of reserve and guard personnel.  2.  The CFETP consists of two parts that supervisors use to manage and control training in this career field.  2.1.  Part I provides information for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how to use this plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other); Section D indicates resource constraints such as funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities.  Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.  2.2.  Part II includes the following:  Section A:  Identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes the duties, tasks, technical references (TRs) to support training, Air Education Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, core tasks, and corresponding course requirements.  Section B:  Contains the course objective list (COL) and training standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirement.  Section C:  Identifies available support materials.  An example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP), which may be developed to support proficiency training.  These packages are located on the Air Force Electronic Publications web site http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/.  Section D:  Identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses.  Section E:  Identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification requirements.  At the unit level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in the Fuels Management Career Field receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career.  This plan enables us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.  4.  Fuels personnel are encouraged to explore available training opportunities using the AETC Education and Training Course Announcements site at https://etca.randolph.af.mil/.  4  ABBREVIATIONS / TERMS EXPLAINED  Advanced Training (AT) - Formal course providing individuals who are qualified in one or more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills/knowledge to enhance their expertise.

The CFETP provides information for the CFM, AFIMSC, commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct effective career field training programs.  This plan outlines the training individuals within the fuels AFS receive to develop and progress throughout their career.  It identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.  Initial skills training (3-skill level) is the AFS training an Airman receives upon entry into the Air Force or retraining into a specialty.  AETC conducts this training at one of the technical training centers.  Upgrade training identifies mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7- and 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.  This training occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training provided to select Airmen.  Proficiency training is additional in-residence or exportable advanced training courses or on-the-job training to increase personnel skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP also serves the following purposes:  1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career.  1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level, and recommends education and training during each phase of an individual’s career  1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method.  1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints impacting full implementation of the desired career field training process.  2.  Uses.  AFIMSC, MFMs and supervisors at all levels use this plan to provide comprehensive and cohesive training programs for each individual in the specialty.   9 2.1.  AETC training personnel develop or revise formal resident, non-resident, field, and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They work with the CFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources to provide the identified training.  2.2.  Supervisors ensure their training programs complement CFETP initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements.  Supervisors use OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses to satisfy training requirements.  MFMs identify MAJCOM-developed unique training requirements for inclusion in the plan.    2.3.  Individuals will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  Use the lists of courses in Part II as a reference to support training.  3.  Coordination and Approval.  The CFM approves the CFETP and initiates the annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy.  AFIMSC, MFMs and AETC training personnel identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements using the list of courses in Part II to eliminate duplicate training.  Section B – Career Progression and Information  4.

Training Decisions.  The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Fuels Career Field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  The Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) determines what, when, and how training material is taught.  The training decisions for the Fuels CFETP were made during the U&TW held at Sheppard AFB, TX in November 2015.  6.1.  Initial Skills Training.  Minor changes were made to the course requirements to increase knowledge and understanding in certain areas such as operating hydrant servicing vehicles and ground servicing vehicles, as well as enhancing understanding of overfill prevention systems.  No other significant changes were made to the Fuels Apprentice Course.  6.2.  Five-Level Upgrade Training.  Major changes were made to the 5-skill level requirements.  Specifically, contingency fuels support equipment task/knowledge level requirements were transferred from 5-level to 7-level CDCs to eliminate training redundancy resulting from training already provided during initial skills training.  6.3.  Seven-Level Upgrade Training.  Major changes were made to the 7-skill level training requirements.  Specifically, it will now include contingency fuels support equipment content.  6.4.  Computer Based Training (CBT) Course Prerequisites.  Two new courses were introduced as prerequisites to the Petroleum Logistics Management Course (PLMC) [J3AZR2F091 00AB] and the Fuels Operational Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE) course [J3AZR2F051 05AB].  The two CBTs are:  1) Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) and 2) Tactical Automated Service Station (TASS).  Both CBTs are accessible through the Advanced Distributed Learning System (ADLS).  6.5.  Proficiency Training.  Additional knowledge and skill requirements, which are not taught through initial skills or upgrade training, are accomplished through specialized course instructions.  A significant change within this area was to transition the Refueling Equipment Maintenance Course [J3AZR2F051 03AB] from the Fuels Career Field to Vehicle Management.  Refer to Part II, Section D, Training Course Index, of this CFETP for a listing of available AETC supplementary training courses.  6.6.  Wartime codes were removed from the Training Business Area (TBA) STS.  All tasks trained in the 3-skill level Fuels Apprentice Course will be covered by adjusting academic instruction to 10 hours a day, six days a week when required due to wartime surge periods.  6.7.  The Fuels CFM has determined 5- and 7-level core tasks will now require third-party certification in accordance with AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program. 6.8.  Task Qualification Training (TQT).  Training and certification of TQT will be accomplished IAW AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution, AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, AFI 36-2201, Force Training Program, and AEF Online Tier 2A, Expeditionary Skills (ES) Proficiency Training/Tier 2B, Home Station Pre-Deployment Training.   12 6.8.1.  Task standardization is key to TQT, ensuring readiness while in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) environment.  Utilizing the concept of “everyone’s a driver,” the tasks personnel will be trained and certified on include aircraft fuel servicing (issue/defuel) using the R-11 or R-12.  These operations will be incorporated into the flight’s TQT Lesson Plan IAW AFI 23-201, Fuels Management.  6.8.2.  Prerequisites.  CBRN Defense Awareness Course (CBT) and CBRN Defense Survival Course (Hands-on).  6.8.3.  Target Audience.  Deployers, personnel going Permanent Change of Station (PCS) or Temporary Duty (TDY) for more than 20 days, to a Medium Threat Area (MTA) or High Threat Area (HTA) listed in AFI 10-2501, Table 4.1 or Threat Compendium, Worldwide Threat to Airbases.  Individuals must be current in CBRN Defense Awareness/Survival at the time of departure and will be considered current for the duration of the assignment (less than 24 months) or TDY/Deployment (regardless of length).  They will receive local conditions training when they arrive at the PCS or TDY/Deployment location within 30 days of arrival.  6.8.4.  TQT Training Frequency.  30 days after CBRN Defense Survival Course (Hands-on).  6.8.4.1.  Exercises.  FMTs will ensure training is provided for individuals participating in exercises where operating in CBRN environment will be expected and not falling under the criteria outlined above.  6.8.4.2.  “In-Place Support.”  Those personnel postured in a Unit Type Code (UTC) and P-Coded DP*/DX* as outlined in AFI 10-401, are not required to accomplish this training until the individual/UTC tasking changes.  6.8.5.  Delivery Format.  FMTs will provide a TQT Lesson Plan that supervisors and trainers will utilize to train and evaluate individuals using the demonstration-performance objectives identified in paragraph 6.8.1.  6.8.6.  Full Credit Requirements.  Individuals successfully complete the demonstrated-performance objective.  6.8.7.  Training will be documented in FuelsManager® Defense (FMD).  6.9.  Training Waivers.  Training, course prerequisites, and skill level core task requirements that personnel are unable to meet or achieve will require a training waiver.  All training waivers will be submitted to the Fuels Career Field Manager IAW AFI 36-2201 and AFI 23-201.  Core task training waivers are not required if the training capability does not exist at the assigned base or another base within the local area.  Annotate the member’s training record with the reason core task training was not accomplished.      13  7.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).

Establishing a viable and sustainable career path for our Airmen requires a deliberate approach and one focusing on opportunities across the spectrum of fuels operations where all Airmen have the ability to gain practical experience.  Moreover, the path prescribes varying levels of fuels professional education as well as developmental education, targeting specific points in an Airman’s career.  Defining developmental goals ensures we align job experience and educational opportunities to support the development of our force.  The goals are outlined as follows:  8.2.1.  Meet the Joint and Combatant Commander’s (CCMD) Needs.  The goal ensures we maintain our warfighting capability at the forefront of our training and development.  We need to have folks postured in the right positions with the right experience and education to meet the Joint and Combatant Commander’s requirements.  8.2.2.  Produce Capabilities to Accomplish the Mission.  This goal substantiates our need for a strong upgrade and on-the-job training program in order to equip our Airmen with the knowledge and skills needed to be successful in their job.  8.2.3.  Deliberately Develop Airmen.  This goal leverages specific training and experience in order to prepare our Airmen for future assignments.  It recognizes previous duties and responsibilities and allows leaders to provide further opportunities for developing Airmen using education, duties, and assignments.    17  8.2.4.  Maximize Return on Investment.  Recognizing every dollar counts, the goal requires the balanced consideration of financial investment with capability when identifying individuals for professional education.  This is also a key indicator when placing individuals into key fuels positions, providing an opportunity to exploit their talent and experience thereby maximizing the time and investment expended to provide the capability.  8.2.5.  Forecast Force Development Requirements.  Education and training is a costly endeavor and to ensure courses are available to meet the needs of our community, we must forecast and budget for the right courses.  This provides a sustainable approach to fuels force development.  8.2.6.  Provide Tools to Navigate Career.  Developing tools to provide a roadmap for the career field ensures our Airmen have the ability to make informed decisions at specific points in their career.  Taking advantage of the various automated capabilities will ensure these tools are available when and where they are needed the most.  8.2.7.  Ensure Members Understand Their Value.  Training, education, and job opportunities provide Air Force members incentives and directly affect their outlook and contribute to their job accomplishment and satisfaction.  Figure 8.2.

Each objective is indicated as follows:  W indicates a task or subject knowledge, which is measured using a written test.  PC indicates a required subject knowledge or task performance, which is measured with a progress check.  P indicates required task performance, which is measured with a performance test.  PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress check.  5.  Standard.  The standard on written examinations varies by course and block of instruction, but is no lower than 70%.  Standards for task performance progress checks are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist.  Instructor assistance, if allowed, is provided as needed during the progress check.  Students failing to perform satisfactorily may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.  6.  Proficiency Level.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the student can do most parts of the task but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.  7.  Course Objectives, Initial Skills Course.  A detailed listing of initial skill course objectives may be obtained by submitting a written request to the schoolhouse Training Manager, 364 TRS/TRR, 511 9th Avenue STE 1, Sheppard AFB, TX 76311-2338.
