Classify  mishaps  IAW  AFI  91-204,  by  total direct  mishap  cost  and  the  severity  of  injury/occupational  illness,  except  as  specified  in  the definitions below. 6 AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 1.3.1.  Operational and Non-Operational Systems.  Non-operational systems include research and  development  satellites,  test  systems,  and  other  missions  that  involve  deliberative  risk acceptance during the acquisition development process. 1.3.1.1.  Classify  any  failure  to  complete  passivation  and/or  disposal  (per  AFI  91-217, Space Safety and Mishap Prevention Program) as a Class C mishap. 1.3.1.2.  Classify any unauthorized creation of orbital debris, 5mm or larger, that involves an Air Force space system as a Class C mishap. 1.3.2.  Operational Systems. For operational systems (or systems transitioned to operations), classify  mishaps  or  event  prior  to  the  end  of  design  life  based  on  the  impact  on  mission capability  (MC).    A  program’s  Capability  Development  Document  (CDD)  or  other Operational  Capability  Requirements  Document  defines  the  MC.    The  document  should define  the  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary  MCs.    Space  systems  may  have  more  than  one primary, secondary, or tertiary MC. 1.3.2.1.  Classify permanent loss of primary mission capability as a Class A mishap. 1.3.2.2.  Classify  permanent  degradation  of  primary  or  secondary  mission  capability  or the permanent loss of secondary mission capability as a Class B mishap. 1.3.2.3.  Classify permanent loss or degradation of tertiary mission capability as a Class C mishap. 1.3.2.4.  Classify  loss  of  operational  capability  of  a  system  (ground  or  on  orbit)  as determined by the MAJCOM owner, as at least a Class E event.  Update mishap or event classification, as appropriate during anomaly resolution following guidance in Section 5. 1.3.3.  Non-Operational Systems. For non-operational systems, classify mishaps as a Class E event.  Depending on the event, a non-operational system’s mishap category maybe upgraded by AF/SE at their discretion. 1.3.3.1.  Use  the  mission  success  criteria,  experiment  plan  or  other  document  (i.e. Operational  Requirements  Document  (ORD),  CDD)  to  identify  impact  to  mission capability. 1.3.3.2.  The  document  should  define  which  aspects  of  the  system  are  experimental  or high-risk, and distinguish them from high-reliability systems not expected to fail. 1.3.4.  Class E Events.  Space Safety staffs will classify any space event deemed important to investigate/report  for  mishap  prevention,  and  which  does  not  meet  other  reportable  space mishap classification criteria, as a Class E event.  Class E reports provide an expeditious way to disseminate valuable mishap prevention information.  As a minimum, report the following in AFSAS: 1.3.4.1.  A collision avoidance maneuver  conducted by  an on-orbit Air  Force spacecraft outside  of  its  normal  collision  avoidance  process.    Include  the  miss  distance  and  time until predicted collision at the point when performing the maneuver. 1.3.4.2.  Any  loss  or  degradation  to  an  on-orbit  asset  due  to  human  error,  even  if occurring after the component / payload / spacecraft design life. 1.3.4.3.  Any hazardous event that could potentially lead to a mishap. AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 7 1.4.  Space Mishap Costs.  It is DoD policy to determine the total direct mishap cost in order to provide  a  factual  basis  for  the  allocation  of  resources  in  support  of  DoD  mishap  prevention programs.    Determine  mishap  costs  IAW  AFI  91-204.    For  destroyed,  lost  assets,  or  partial mission  capable  (PMC)  assets  with  no  item  to  exchange,  use  the  cost  from  the  program  (DD Form 250). 8 AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  General  Information.  Follow  guidance  listed  in  AFI  91-204,  with  the  following  space-specific additions: 2.2.  HQ  AFSEC/SES.  For  non-DoD  launches  from  Air  Force  launch  facilities  and/or  ranges, HQ  AFSEC/SES  will  ensure  investigation  and  reporting  agreements  allow  the  Air  Force  to participate at least as an observer on FAA, NASA, and/or NTSB-led investigation boards.  This participation  includes  gathering  information  to  put  into  AFSAS  for  future  mishap  prevention purposes. 2.3.  MAJCOM  Commanders.  Commanders  will  establish  a  process  to  enable  timely identification  and  assignment  of  safety  investigation  board  (SIB)  presidents  and  single investigating officers (SIO) for Space Safety investigations. 2.4.  The Convening Authority (CA).  The CA will forward to HQ AFSEC/SES as quickly as is practical,  all  critical  safety  information  discovered  by  a  SIB  related  to  any  relevant  civil  space vehicle and commercial space equipment.  HQ AFSEC/SES will forward all such non-privileged information  contributing the  Federal  Aviation Administration  (FAA),  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA),  and  National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) for appropriate action. the  promotion  of  Space  Safety to to 2.5.  Commanders of Air Force launch and/or range operations. 2.5.1.  Prior  to  each  operation  (e.g.,  launch,  fly-back,  re-entry),  commanders  of  Air  Force launch facilities, and/or ranges will: 2.5.1.1.  Identify  and  notify  organizations  that  will  incur  investigation  responsibility should a mishap or event occur. 2.5.1.2.  Establish an Interim Safety Board (ISB) President. 2.5.2.  Launch Facility and/or Range Commanders will notify the FAA Office of Commercial Space  Transportation  when  a  mishap  and/or  event  occurs  involving  a  licensed  commercial space  system  at  Air  Force  launch  facilities  and/or  ranges.    During  launch  of  a  commercial space vehicle from an Air Force launch facility and/or range, the on-site FAA representative, if/when present, will fulfill this notification requirement and up-channel as required. 2.6.  Unit Commanders. 2.6.1.  The commander of the first Air Force organization to become aware of a space mishap and/or  event  will  notify  the  organization  with  control  authority  over  the  affected  space system. 2.6.2.  For  high-risk  activities  with  significant  mishap  potential,  the  Unit  Commander identifies an ISB President prior to conducting the activity. 2.7.  Interim Safety Board (ISB) President. 2.7.1.  The  ISB  President,  under  certain  circumstances,  may  have  to  interface  with  non-Air Force  organizations  (e.g.,  Lockheed  Martin  (LM)  Company,  Northrop  Grumman  (NG), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), FAA, NASA, NTSB, commercial vendors). AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 9 2.7.2.  The  ISB  President  will  follow  existing  agreements,  when  applicable,  with  respect  to wreckage and evidence owned by non-Air Force organizations. 2.7.3.  For  mishaps  in  which  the  FAA,  NASA,  or  NTSB  is  the  CA  or  lead  investigating agency,  per  AFI  91-204  and  AFI  91-206(I),  ISB  members  shall  refrain  from  interviewing witnesses  until  the  CA  or  lead  investigating  agency  representatives  arrive,  unless  there  is  a compelling reason to  take the witness' statement(s) immediately  (i.e., transient witnesses or perishable evidence).  (T-2) 2.7.4.  Provide a hand-off briefing to SIB or SIO that marks the end of the ISB's involvement in  the  investigation.    Hand-off  briefing  will  review  ISB  actions  accomplished  to  date  and updated site hazard information. 2.7.5.  At a minimum, an ISB will stand up after a declaration of a Class E or at the direction of the MAJCOM or HQ AFSEC/SES. 2.7.6.  The ISB is not responsible for determining mishap cause(s).  The sole purpose of the ISB is to gather, preserve and protect evidence.  The ISB investigation is normally limited to determining what evidence exists.  The ISB only analyzes evidence when it will perish prior to arrival of the permanent SIB and with CA or SIB BP permission.  The ISB is responsible for: 2.7.6.1.  Notifying the owning installation of the need to collect personnel records.  (T-1) 2.7.6.2.  Impounding  all  equipment  and/or  data,  which  may  relate  to  the  mishap.    The items  of  interest  to  impound  are  typically  in  the  installation’s  Mishap  Response  Plan (MRP).  Refer to AFI 91-204 for further guidance.  (T-1) 2.7.6.3.  Collecting perishable fluids and photographing the mishap site.  (T-1) 2.7.6.4.  Preserving  integrity  of  the  evidence,  ensure  only  ISB  members  have  access  to the evidence pending transfer over to the SIB.  (T-1) 2.7.6.5.  Identifying  possible  witnesses  and  gathering  preliminary  statements  as appropriate.  (T-1) 2.8.  Joint/DoD/Non-DoD  Space  Safety  Guidelines.  All  participating  organizations  within  a mission partnership should establish Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) or Memorandums of Understanding  (MOUs)  outlining  each  organization’s  responsibilities  and  requirements  with regard  to  Space  Safety  Investigations  and  Reports.    This  includes  organizations  operating  in  a joint  environment  or  with  non-Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  agencies.    It  is  the  participating organizations’  responsibilities  to  determine  the  lead  agency  and  proper  approval  authorities.  Refer  to  AFI  91-206(I),  Participation  in  a  Military  or  Civil  Aircraft  Accident  Safety Investigation, for joint investigation guidance. 10 AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 Chapter 3 PRIVILEGED SAFETY INFORMATION 3.1.  General  Information.  For  privileged  safety  information,  follow  the  guidance  in  AFI  91-204 and the following space-specific additions: 3.1.1.  Investigations involving or affecting multiple agencies require special attention to the handling  of  safety  information,  privileged  or  not.    SIB  Presidents/SIOs  will  release information  collected  by  safety  investigators  to  outside  AF  safety  channels  only  IAW  this manual and AFI 91-204, carefully observing guidance regarding privileged information. 3.1.2.  In all cases, contact the Headquarters Air Force Safety Center, Staff Judge Advocate (HQ  AFSEC/JA)  for  approval  to  release.    In  certain  cases,  the  Air  Force  may  exchange privileged  safety  information  with  other  DoD  agencies  solely  for  mishap  prevention purposes.  In addition, the Air Force shares certain mishap prevention information with other entities  in  the  interests  of  the  general  safety  community.    Commonality  of  launch  vehicles, launch  vehicle  systems,  components,  and  launch  range  safety  systems  exists  for  launches conducted under launch licenses issued by the FAA and launches conducted by and for the Air Force.  The FAA and the Air Force therefore require timely knowledge of the facts and circumstances  of  commercial  space  launch  accidents.    Reference  14  Code  of  Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 401.5. 3.1.2.1.  An Air Force safety investigator discovering a critical safety concern applicable to  commercial  spaceflight  will  provide  that  information  to  HQ  AFSEC/SES  for consideration of release to other organizations IAW AFI 91-204. 3.1.2.2.  Send  all  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA)  requests,  subpoenas,  or  other requests  involving  safety  information  protected  by  the  military  safety  privilege  to  HQ AFSEC/JA, IAW AFI 91-204. 3.1.3.  When the Air Force participates in an investigation led by the NTSB, FAA or NASA, the Air Force will protect all investigation data, information, documents, or other material as prescribed by the investigating agency.  The Air Force will not  disclose this  information  in any  manner  without  the  written  consent  of  the  Investigator-in-Charge.    In  addition,  the  Air Force  will  refer  any  FOIA  request,  subpoena,  or  other  request  for  such  information  to  the NTSB, FAA or NASA for resolution. 3.2.  Releasing  Recommendations.  Only  HQ  AF  may  release  an  AF  investigative  board’s conclusion  attributing  cause  to  another  agency  or  recommendation  of  corrective  action  by another agency, IAW AFI 91-204.  For the release of safety information to the FAA, NASA or the NTSB for space mishaps, use AFI 91-206 as a guide. AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 11 Chapter 4 DETERMINING INVESTIGATIVE RESPONSIBILITY 4.1.  General Information.  The Air Force generally assigns investigative responsibilities to the MAJCOM  experiencing  operational  loss  of  an  assigned/owned  asset  (personnel  or  property).  Unless  otherwise  stated,  the  mishap  owner  (as  determined  IAW  AFI  91-204)  has  investigative responsibility for the mishap. 4.1.1.  The CA is the individual who has the authority to order a safety investigation. 4.1.2.  The MAJCOM/CC of the organization that  owns the asset is the CA unless:  AF/SE assumes investigative responsibility (with the concurrence of the owning organization and AF/SE), or investigative responsibility is delegated to a lower level of command. responsibility,  another  MAJCOM/CC  assumes investigative 4.2.  Determining  AF  Space  Mishap  Ownership.  The  mishap  owner  is  that  unit  which  has permanent possession and mishap reporting accountability for the affected asset and/or personnel involved in the mishap.  Assign ownership of the space mishap to the MAJCOM responsible for the space system at the time of the mishap. 4.2.1.  For  satellites,  assign  mishap  ownership  to  the  MAJCOM  with  satellite  control authority. 4.2.1.1.  Satellite control authority for an on-orbit space system, or the debris associated with it, does not end until:  re-entry and touchdown on Earth; transfer of responsibility to another  agency;  or  injection  into  an  Earth-escape  trajectory  as  part  of  the  end-of-life process  (e.g.,  satellite  control  authority  does  not  end  for  space  systems  in  a  non-operational orbit). 4.2.1.2.  For non-operational satellites, the last organization with SCA maintains SCA for the purposes of mishap reporting. 4.2.2.  For  launch  vehicles,  including  upper  stages,  assign  ownership  of  the  mishap  to  the MAJCOM acquiring the launch vehicle unless an agreement is in place specifying transfer of ownership to another agency. 4.2.3.  Aerospace  Vehicle  Contractor  Mishaps  Involving  Air  Force  Indemnification.    For operations involving unusually hazardous safety risks that the Air Force indemnified, such as contractor  provided  launch  services  for  Air  Force  or  National  Security  Space  payloads,  the MAJCOM that acquired the operational service is the CA for the mishap. 4.2.4.  If the Air Force leads a safety investigation, HQ AFSEC/SES will consider providing the FAA, NASA, or the NTSB the opportunity to participate in the investigation according to each agency’s respective role or interest. 4.3.  Determining Commercial Space Mishap Ownership. 4.3.1.  Depending  on  the  circumstances,  commercial  space  asset  mishaps  within  US jurisdiction may be investigated by the FAA, NASA, NTSB, and/or the commercial vendor.  If  the  FAA/NTSB  leads  such  an  investigation,  it  is  implicit  the  FAA/NTSB  will  retain 12 AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 custody  of  evidence  for  the  duration  of  the  investigation  whether  referring  to  physical  or intellectual (i.e. witness accounts). 4.3.2.  Reference  existing  MOAs/MOUs  to  determine  the  correct  mishap  investigation agency for commercial space mishaps. AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 13 Chapter 5 SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS 5.1.  General  Information.  The  CA  determines  the  depth  of  investigative  effort  required  for each mishap/event.  Conduct the investigations IAW AFI 91-204 and the space-specific guidance contained  in  this  chapter.    Conduct  safety  investigations  using  a  SIB  or  SIO.    Briefing  slide templates, suggested resources, and checklists are available through the AFSEC SIB SUPPORT page on the AF Portal (also see AFSAS Pubs & Refs tab).  If necessary and directed by the CA, conduct Air Force safety investigations concurrently with other applicable investigations. 5.2.  Investigation Timelines. 5.2.1.  All timeline milestones begin  at mishap declaration.  This is normally the same time that the mishap occurs.   For some space mishaps/events,  there may be  a  delay between the occurrence and declaration of mishap/event. 5.2.1.1.  Notify  the  CA  safety  office  within  72  hours  of  any  unresolved  anomaly.    The CA safety office shall observe the anomaly resolution  process  and transition  to  a safety investigation  when  /  if  enough  information  exists  to  classify  the  anomaly  as mishap/event.    The  CA  may  delegate  to  another  safety  office  for  initial  anomaly  status reporting.  (T-2) 5.2.1.2.  At  any  point  during  the  anomaly  process  when  it  has  been  determined  an anomaly meets the definition of a space mishap/event, declare a space mishap/event and start a safety investigation. 5.2.2.  Complete  SIB/SIO  investigations  within  90  days  for  Class  A  and  B  mishaps  and  45 days  for  all  other  mishaps/events.    Refer  to  AFI  91-204  for  reporting  and  routing requirements. 5.2.3.  Due  to  the  complexity  of  the  data  recovery  and  engineering  analysis  process,  space mishaps might require longer timeframes.  If circumstances prevent meeting a timeline, the board  president/SIO  may  request  an  extension  from  the  CA.    The  SIB/SIO  annotates  the extension and approval by the CA in each status message.  AF/SE has the authority to reject any extension request in order to ensure the timely completion of a safety investigation. 5.3.  Investigation Funding. 5.3.1.  Follow the funding guidance in AFI 91-204. 5.3.2.  Observers to an Air Force SIB fund their own TDY. 5.3.3.  Additional  Funding  Guidance  for  Mishaps  Involving  Civil  and  Commercial  Space Assets.    If  the  Air  Force  is  the  CA  or  the  mishap  owner  for  a  mishap  involving  civil  or commercial space mishaps, use the following funding guidance: 5.3.3.1.  In  general,  if  the  space  mishap  occurs  at  a  facility  not  located  on  an  Air  Force installation,  then  the  home  base  of  the  investigating  organization  acts  as  the  host installation  for  the  investigation  and  is  responsible  for  providing  and  funding  local support. 14 AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 5.3.3.2.  To  properly  investigate  space  mishaps,  there  may  be  a  need  for  multiple  host installations.  The closest Air Force base to the mishap site, to an investigation location (contractor/civil/government), and to the investigation organization’s home location will fund and provide in-house support at the request of the board president. 5.3.3.3.  See AFI 91-204 for expenses that exceed the resources of the host installation. 5.4.  Investigation Options. 5.4.1.  The CA determines the size and membership of the safety investigation based on the category and complexity of the mishap.  Investigations can utilize multiple members (SIB) or SIO. 5.4.1.1.  As a minimum, AF safety investigations must have an SIO appointed.  A space mishap  SIO  should  be  a  space  professional  and  graduate  of  formal  Air  Force  safety training and mishap investigation courses. 5.4.1.2.  The  CA  can  support  investigation  and  reporting  of  Class  E  events  using  a program/operation  anomaly  resolution  process  for  analyzing  technical  data  and  other fact-based  information.    Follow  guidance  in  AFI  91-204  for  the  handling  of  any privileged information. 5.4.2.  At least one SIB member must be at least equal in grade to the senior person directly involved in the mishap.  Normally, the SIB president is the senior SIB member.  The Board President should be the senior person on a SIB.  The CA may tailor the following personnel requirements,  limitations,  and  restrictions  for  Primary  and  Non-Primary  SIB  Members  as appropriate for space mishaps: 5.4.2.1.  Safety  Investigation  Board  President,  a  space  professional  and  graduate  of formal Air Force safety training and mishap investigation courses. 5.4.2.2.  Air  Force  Safety  Center  Representative.    HQ  AFSEC/SES  has  the  option  to provide a representative or advisor to the SIB for on-duty Class A mishaps, unusual high interest  off-duty  Class  A  mishaps,  and  complex  Class  B  mishaps,  as  determined  by AFSEC/SES  and  CA.    AFSEC  will  fund  the  representative.  AFSEC/SES  will  offer telephonic support for all Class A mishaps.  A HQ AFSEC/SES representative assigned to the SIB is a primary member and acts as the investigation process expert to guide SIB procedures.  A HQ AFSEC/SES advisor supports the SIB as a non-primary member.  The HQ AFSEC/SES representative or advisor is the single point of contact with AFSEC for the duration of the investigation. 5.4.2.3.  Space  Operations  Officer,  qualified  or  previously  qualified,  in  the  operational use of the space system involved in the mishap. 5.4.2.4.  Space  Materiel  Officer  or  Acquisition  Officer,  qualified  in  the  maintenance, engineering, or manufacturing of the space system involved in the mishap. 5.4.2.5.  Weather Officer or Space Environmental Expert, if weather, weather service, or space environment is suspect or a known factor in the mishap. 5.4.2.6.  For  mishaps  involving  potential  human  error,  the  medical  member  must  be  a flight  surgeon  graduated  from  the  USAF  School  of  Aerospace  Medicine  mishap investigation course. AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 15 5.4.2.6.1.  Any  appropriate  expert  when  mishaps  involve  areas  not  specified  in 5.4.2.1.-5.4.2.6.  (e.g.,  appropriate  human  factor  professional,  medical  officer, environmental scientist). 5.4.2.7.  Non-primary SIB Members. 5.4.2.7.1.  The CA may select non-primary SIB members at his/her discretion. 5.4.2.7.2.  Representatives  to  serve  as  liaisons,  advisors,  or  consultants.    This  may include  the  FAA,  NASA,  NTSB,  or  joint  service  observers.    Refer  to  applicable MOAs/MOUs for specific requirements. 5.4.3.  Use of Non-Air  Force  Investigations.  While the Air Force is  always responsible for determining  the  cause of Air  Force mishaps, in certain  situations the  Air  Force may  accept the  results  of  a  non-Air  Force  investigation  to  satisfy  Air  Force  mishap  prevention requirements  as  directed  by  the  CA.    The  FAA,  NASA,  NTSB,  or  the  space  system  owner will  usually  investigate  commercial  space  mishaps.    When  possible,  the  Air  Force  should make  use  of  these  investigations  and  limit  duplicative  investigations.    However,  the  Air Force always retains the right to conduct a separate Air Force safety investigation. 5.4.3.1.  The  Air  Force  will  observe  all  investigations  related  to  the  mishap  IAW  this document,  the  applicable  MOAs/MOUs,  and  AFI  91-206.    Air  Force  observers  will contact the appropriate MAJCOM Safety office or AFSEC/SES for guidance on current agreements with the FAA, NASA, NTSB, and the responsible commercial entity. 5.4.3.2.  The Air Force observer reports to the CA on the adequacy of the investigation, the  validity  of  the  conclusions,  and  advises  on  whether  the  conclusions  satisfy  Air Force’s mishap prevention needs. 5.4.3.3.  Based  on  the  Air  Force  observer’s  assessment  on  the  adequacy  of  the  non-Air Force  investigation  report,  the  Air  Force  CA  may  accept  it  with  a  cover  letter  from  the Air  Force  observer  stating  acceptance  of  findings  and  submit  as  the  Air  Force  final report.   The Air  Force observer will ensure the prepared  report  and  cover letter  contain non-privileged information.  Alternately, the CA may appoint another SIO to evaluate the report  and  deliver  an  Air  Force  mishap  report.    In  this  case,  the  Air  Force  report  shall include the non-Air Force report.  (T-1) 5.4.3.4.  If  the  Air  Force  CA  determines  that  the  investigation  will  not  satisfy  the  Air Force’s mishap prevention needs, the Air Force will conduct its own investigation within the terms of applicable contracts and agreements. 5.4.4.  Air  Force  Participation  in  non-Air  Force  Investigations.    When  the  Air  Force participates  in  another  service’s  or  government  agency's  investigation,  AFSEC  will  contact the MAJCOM(s) that can best meet the requirement.  The MAJCOM/SE will coordinate the selection  of  the  participant  with  AFSEC/SES.    Once  AF/SE  approves  the  nominee, AFSEC/SES  will  provide  a  fund  site  to  the  MAJCOM  and  establish  direct  communication with  the  individual.    Air  Force  representatives  to  Joint  Safety  Investigations  should  be graduates of formal Air Force safety training courses. 5.4.5.  Use of Air Force Observers on Non-Air Force Investigations.  Outside agencies such as  the  FAA,  NASA,  or  the  NTSB  may  allow  Air  Force  personnel  to  participate  as  official observers  to  investigations  led  by  these  agencies.    Air  Force  observers  will  adhere  to  the 16 AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 applicable  MOAs/MOUs,  AFI  91-206,  and  the  provisions  of  Title  49  CFR,  Part  831,  as applicable. 5.4.5.1.  Observers  are  not  formal  Air  Force  safety  investigators  and  cannot  offer promises of confidentiality per AFI 91-204. 5.4.5.2.  Air  Force  observers  may  participate  but  may  not  interfere  with  the  observed investigation.    Air  Force  observers  will  refrain  from  making  judgment  calls,  providing opinions, or analysis, or writing any part of the report unless specifically requested to do so by the lead investigating agency. 5.4.5.3.  Air Force observers may not observe multiple investigations simultaneously nor may  they  participate  in  any  other  investigations  while  still  acting  in  an  observer  status.  Observers may transition from an Air Force observer to an Air Force SIB to provide the SIB  with  continuity;  however,  once  transferred,  may  no  longer  serve  as  an  Air  Force observer or transfer back to observer status. 5.4.6.  Personnel observing or participating in an investigation will be under the control and direction  of  the  lead  agency's  chief  investigator  (e.g.,  NTSB  "Investigator-In-Charge,"  or FAA  "Investigator-In-Charge").    All  such  personnel  will  follow  the  lead  agency's  rules regarding  the  handling  and/or  release  of  information,  or  other  evidence  collected  during  an investigation. 5.5.  Obtaining  and  Using  Technical  Assistance  and  Laboratory  Analysis.  The  contractor and the system  program  office, in  coordination with the SIB and Accident  Investigation  Board (AIB)  presidents,  may  establish  an  Engineering  Analysis  Group  (EAG)  or  similar  to  assist  in analyzing the technical data from a mishap.  Refer to Attachment 2, AFI 51-503 and the launch or space system contract. 5.5.1.  For  space  mishaps,  the  EAG  conducts  a  technical  examination  of  mishap  data.    It provides important fact-based (non- privileged) analysis to the SIB and the AIB and assures the  release  of  this  fact-based  information  as  soon  as  possible  to  the  Commercial  Space Industry. 5.5.2.  The  SIB  and  the  AIB  will  pass  fact-based  mishap  data  to  the  EAG.    The  EAG  will pass  the  results  of  its  engineering  analysis  to  both  the  SIB  and  the  AIB  as  soon  as  it  is available. 5.5.3.  The EAG’s engineering analysis is non-privileged information. 5.5.3.1.  If  the  EAG’s  engineering  analysis  is  classified,  the  information  owner  must clearly mark and control appropriately. 5.5.3.2.  If  the  engineering  analysis  contains  proprietary  information,  the  information owner must clearly mark and control appropriately. 5.5.4.  The EAG will provide updates, as directed by the SIB president or SIO, to SIB or ISB members on the status of the engineering analysis.  SIB members may monitor the EAG but will not direct or provide input to the EAG. AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 17 Chapter 6 REPORTS AND BRIEFINGS the  AFSAS. 6.1.  General  Information.  Safety reports include messages (preliminary, 10-day, status, final, and final supplemental), formal reports, injury and occupational illness forms, and logs.   Safety reporting  will  be  via for  AFSAS:  https://afsas.af.mil/Home.do.    If  AFSAS  is  not  available,  contact  HQ  AFSEC/SES  for transmission  alternatives  at  AFSEC.SES@us.af.mil.    Once  the  SIB/SIO  completes  the investigation,  finalizes  the  formal  report,  and  the  final  message,  the  SIB/SIO  will  normally provide  a  briefing  to  the  CA.    Space  mishaps  involving  fatalities,  or  other  mishaps  when requested, require a briefing to the CSAF and Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF).  AF/SEI will be the focal point for scheduling all briefings to the CSAF and SECAF and will coordinate with HQ AFSEC/SES. following  URL   Use the 6.1.1.  Report space mishaps in accordance with AFI 91-204. 6.1.2.  When a non-Air Force organization’s report exists that fulfills the requirements of an Air Force final report, the CA may use it as the official final investigation report.  Complete a report in AFSAS and include the non-Air Force organization’s report. 6.2.  Marking Messages, Reports, Documents, and Other Safety Materials. 6.2.1.  Space  mishap  messages  and  safety  reports  are  subject  to  limited  distribution,  and control therein appropriately. 6.2.2.  Make every effort to keep investigative reports and briefings unclassified to ensure the widest  dissemination possible.  Report the unclassified portion of the report (i.e., one-liner, date,  time,  location,  Investigating  Officer,  and  objects)  using  AFSAS.    Do  not  input  DoD Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (DCNI) into AFSAS. 6.2.2.1.  Report  classified  mishaps  IAW  the  template  in  AFI  91-204.    The  SIO  or  SIB President  will  place  the  final  report  on  a  mission  owning  unit-shared  drive  IAW  the Security Classification Guide (SCG) of the system with copies provided to the MAJCOM and AFSEC safety work centers, as security guidance permits.  (T-2) 6.2.2.2.  Mark  classified  pages  in  messages,  reports,  or  other  safety  documents  with  the proper  security  classification  marking  from  the  appropriate  SCG  and  AFI  16-1404,  Air Force Information Security Program. 6.2.3.  For  materials  containing  privileged  information,  follow  the  guidance  in  AFI  91-204.  Place  the  Privilege  Warning  statement  IAW  AFI  91-204,  at  the  foot  of  each  page  that contains  privileged  information.    Do  not  place  the  Privilege  Warning  on  unclassified,  non-privileged pages, on preliminary messages, or on other fact-based only material. 6.2.4.  For  each  page  that  contains  proprietary  information,  as  identified  by  a  contractor, include  an  appropriate  proprietary  information  warning.    This  warning  must  identify  the extent of the protection required (e.g., Government Only, Air Force Only). 6.3.  Guidance  for  Space  Mishap  Formal  Reports.  Formal  safety  reports  present  detailed information, both fact-based and analytical, about mishaps.  Prepare them IAW AFI 91-204 and the following guidance: 18 AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 6.3.1.  Distributing the  Formal  Report.  The CA  will ensure the upload of all non-waivered formal reports into AFSAS.  All Air Force agencies with a need to know can access the tabs or request tab access via AFSAS.  If the report references a document, attach a copy of the document to the AFSAS report. 6.3.2.  Do  not  provide  copies  or  extracts  to  agencies  outside  the  Air  Force.    If  an  agency outside the Air Force requires a copy of the formal report for mishap prevention, corrective actions, or other purpose, notify HQ AFSEC/JA.  Distribute formal reports IAW AFI 91-204. AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 19 Chapter 7 FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS 7.1.  General  Information.  Reviewing  authorities,  CAs,  and  HQ  AFSEC/SES  will  conduct follow-up actions to ensure program compliance, hazard mitigation, and trending validity.  These three areas are core safety functions required at every level.  Follow guidance in AFI 91-204. 7.2.  Review Process.  CA safety staffs will review messages and formal reports prior to release in  AFSAS  for  AFI  compliance,  completeness,  and  accuracy.    Although  SIBs/SIOs  retain authority for all substantive report changes, the report must comply with this  AFMAN and AFI 91-204. 7.3.  Memorandum of Final Evaluation (MOFE).  HQ AFSEC/SES prepares a MOFE for each Class A and Class B mishap.  Refer to AFI 91-204, Chapter 7, for more details on this process. 7.4.  Tracking  Recommendations.

The Air Force may or may not be the space system owner. AIR FORCE SAFETY AUTOMATED SYSTEM (AFSAS)— Safety reporting will be via the AFSAS.  AFSAS is a CAC-enabled system that ensures the protection of privileged information.  To protect the privileged status and to ensure the correct handling of safety reports, originating organizations  will  use  the  AFSAS  reporting  system  to  transmit  messages.    Use  the  following URL for AFSAS:  https://afsas.af.mil/Home.do. ANOMALY—  An  unexpected  or  unplanned  condition  that  does  not  meet  provided  system performance parameters and which cannot be corrected by organizational maintenance resources in accordance with validated procedures.  After analysis, an “out-of-family” condition could be declared an anomaly. 24 AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 ANOMALY  RESOLUTION  PROCESS—  Process  used  to  resolve  a  spacecraft  anomaly.  Typically conducted by the operating/testing organization (squadron or equivalent level). CAUSE— A cause is a deficiency, which if corrected, eliminated, or avoided, would likely have prevented or mitigated the mishap damage or significant injury. CONTRACTOR  MISHAP—  A  mishap  resulting  from  contractor  operations  that  involves injury  to  DoD  personnel  and/or  damage  to  DoD  resources.    Note:    when  determining  if  a contractor employee’s injury or illness requires reporting for recordkeeping requirements under 29 CFR 1904 refer to Chapter 1 of AFI 91-204. CONVENING  AUTHORITY  (CA)—  The  individual  who  has  the  authority  to  order  a  safety investigation. CSAF  OPREP—3  REPORTS  MATRIX  -  The  CSAF  OPREP-3  Reports  Matrix  is  a  quick reference list to assist commanders and controllers in determining the level and type of report to submit  based  on  events  and  incidents  deemed  of  interest  to  the  CSAF,  Chairman  of  the  Joint Chiefs  of  Staff  (CJCS).    As  operational  situations  evolve  the  need  to  update  reporting requirements as AF/A3O or higher directs, the CSAF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix are posted on the Command Post (CP) Intelink Site. ENGINEERING  ANALYSIS  GROUP  (EAG)—  An  independent  group  of  contractor personnel, Air Force representatives, and other experts established to assist the SIB and AIB in analyzing  the  technical  data  from  a  space  mishap  investigation.    The  EAG  may  recommend  to the  SIB  president  and  AIB  president  that  certain  non-privileged  evidence  and  equipment  be released while the investigations are pending in order that space launches may continue. EVENT— An unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that does not meet the reporting criteria of a mishap. FAA LICENSED LAUNCH— Any commercial launch or re-entry issued a license by Federal Aviation Administration’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation. FINDINGS—  Findings  are  what  the  safety  investigator  concluded  and  are  statements,  in chronological order, of the significant events sustaining the sequence leading to the mishap. FOR  OFFICIAL  USE  ONLY  (FOUO)—  A  protective  marking  to  be  applied  to  unclassified information  when  disclosure  to  the  public  of  that  particular  record,  or  portion  thereof,  would reasonably  be  expected  to  cause  a  foreseeable  harm  to  an  interest  protected  by  one  or  more provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  This includes information that qualifies for  protection  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  Privacy  Act  of  1974,  as  amended.    See DOD5400.7-R_AFMAN33-302, Freedom of Information Act Program, for detailed information on categories of information that may qualify for exemption from public release. FORMAL  REPORTS—  Formal  reports  present  detailed  factual  and  analytical  information about  mishaps.    AFSAS  is  the  only  acceptable  method  for  mishap  reporting.    Upload  formal reports  as  tabs  into  AFSAS.    All  Class  A  and  B  space  mishaps  require  a  formal  report  unless waived by the Air Force Chief of Safety (AF/SE).

Space Safety investigations and accident investigations may be conducted simultaneously and  rely  heavily  on  the  receipt  of  the  technical  analyses  conducted  by  the  EAG,  in  arriving  at their findings and conclusions. A2.1.1.  There are many unique aspects of a space mishap investigation, including: A2.1.1.1.  Often, there is no terrestrial mishap site; the only tie to the ground will be the launch or operations center. A2.1.1.2.  With on-orbit mishaps, the only source of information/evidence relating to the mishap is often telemetry data.  Commercial launch providers may have recordings (data, audio, and video) of launch events that could be useful to the Air Force (The Aerospace Corp STARS (Spacelift Telemetry and Recording System) facility. A2.1.1.3.  Space  systems  often  do  not  have  DoD  maintenance  personnel;  contractors provide support for launch and on-orbit operations. A2.1.1.4.  Most  military  satellites  are  bought  in  limited  quantities;  after  the  last  is launched, contractor support quickly dwindles as those who built the craft and have the most knowledge of it have moved on to other projects. A2.1.1.5.  Many space mishaps, particularly on-orbit, are classified. A2.2.  The  Engineering  Analysis  Group.    The  contractor  and  the  system  program  office,  in coordination with the SIB and AIB presidents, may establish an EAG to assist in analyzing the technical data from a mishap. A2.2.1.  The  group  is  composed  of  contractor  personnel  (who  must  sign  confidentiality agreements), Air Force representatives, and other experts, as necessary. A2.2.2.  The EAG is not required to identify causes or to make recommendations, but may do so. A2.2.3.  The EAG works with, but independently of, both the SIB and AIB.  The EAG is not subject to the direction or supervision of either board. A2.2.3.1.  The SIB and AIB may ask questions of the EAG; however, the EAG may not discuss SIB comments with AIB members. A2.2.4.  The EAG may  recommend to the SIB president and the  AIB president that certain non-privileged  evidence  and  equipment  be  released  in  order  that  space  launches  may continue. A2.2.4.1.  The AIB president, with the concurrence of the SIB president, shall release any such evidence or equipment unless doing so will hinder the SIB.  (T-2) A2.2.5.  Under no  circumstances will the EAG take any  action that will hinder the work of the SIB or AIB.  If at any time, the work of the EAG is thought to be hindering the ability of the  AIB  to  meet  its  objectives,  the  AIB  president  shall  notify  the  HQ  AFSEC/JA immediately.  (T-2) A2.2.6.  The SIB or AIB is not required to adopt any findings or conclusions of the EAG. AFMAN91-222  22 DECEMBER 2016 30
