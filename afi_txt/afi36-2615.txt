Purpose. The processes used to determine officer accession and training requirements have varioususes. The first is to determine the number required to sustain each career field to accomplish its functionalmission for the Air Force. The second is to provide commissioning sources with stabilized accessiongoals to afford ample time to produce officers with the proper education background to meet Air Forcecareer field sustainment requirements. Third, accession determination processes provide AFPCNon-Rated Line Officer Accessions with career field-specific requirements, maximizing the opportunityto project the number of officers that may be assigned to each career field based on Air Force needs andacademic qualifications. Lastly, this process links accession sustainment requirements to programmaticfunding process for initial skills training. 1.2.  Aggregate Resource Programming. Determining Air Force accession aggregate and disaggregatesustainment requirements is the first step in preparing and programming for Air Force accession produc-tion and training requirements. Programming the accession aggregate is affected by budgetary consider-ations, projected force structure, and mission changes. HQ USAF/DPLFR determines the accessionaggregate and mix for up to six future fiscal years. This accession mix includes the total number ofenlisted, recall and non-line authorizations, and line officer production. United States Air Force Academy(USAFA) student inventory will be in accordance with provisions of Title 10, United States Code. Aggre-gate Headquarters Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS) accessions allowed toenter active duty in a particular fiscal year is transmitted via the Line Officer Accession Plan (LOAP)under signature of HQ USAF/DPL. Changes to the LOAP will not be made within two years of the pro-duction year, unless fully coordinated with HQ AETC/DO, HQ AETC/XP, HQ AFOATS/CC, HQ AFPC/CC, HQ AFRS/CC, and other appropriate organizations then approved by HQ USAF/DP. 1.3.  Accession Determination. The determination of Non-Rated Line (NRL) officer accession sustain-ment occurs via the processes outlined in this AFI. Successful accession/recruitment efforts for each pro-cess are measured when the military member enters active duty. 1.3.1.  The NRL officer sustainment process is based on the sustainment needs of each specialty andis determined by weighing the funded manpower authorizations, the number of personnel performingduties in the specialty, the number of personnel possessing the core Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)who are working outside the specialty (i.e., special duty, in-residence professional military educationor graduate school, etc.), the retention within the specialty, and the career field health. Career fieldsustainment needs generate accession requirements. The NRL officer sustainment process designatesmandatory academic targets, affords commissioning sources ample lead time to produce officers tomeet accession requirements, determines the acceptable range of accessions by AFSC (bands) forfuture fiscal years, and provides the means to project and classify officer accessions into NRL special-ties upon commissioning. New officer accessions are classified into Air Force specialties before com-missioning based primarily on Air Force needs and career field requirements, while also taking intoaccount the officer’s academic qualifications and career field preferences. Due to the requirement forofficers to possess an undergraduate academic degree prior to commissioning and mandatory aca-demic qualifications for entry into some specialties, accession requirements have a direct relationshipwith the number of persons in certain undergraduate academic degree programs at the commissioningsources. Commissioning and recruiting sources must develop programs and processes to comply with4AFI36-2615   11 OCTOBER 2004mandatory academic qualifications and total production targets to ensure the appropriate number ofqualified officer accessions can be classified into appropriate AFSCs. For example, attrition andlosses to rated programs must be taken into account when determining the right number of officer can-didates in each commissioning source. USAFA and Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps(AFROTC) will develop programs more than two years out in order to achieve the appropriate NRLproduction levels. Successful accession efforts are measured by comparing the commissioning num-bers (by academic degree and commissioning source) and the post-classification numbers (by AFSC)to the accession sustainment targets. 1.3.1.1.  The Air Force NRL accession sustainment requirement will be used to program accessionproduction targets and will be the basis for programming the accession part of initial skills train-ing. For the most part, accession inputs into each AFSC will be centered on the AFSC sustainmentnumber; any temporary deviations from that sustainment will be coordinated with HQ AETC/DO,HQ AETC/XP, HQ AFOATS/CC, HQ AFPC/CC, and other appropriate organizations, thenapproved and published by HQ USAF/DPL. HQ USAF/DPL will publish bands by AFSC and bymandatory academic requirement. Sample bands can be found at Table 1.1. Bands, established byanalysis, depict color-coded “more than” and “less than” ranges on either side of the sustainmentrequirement for AFSCs and mandatory academic requirements. These bands form the basis formeasuring accessions. HQ USAF/DPL is the approval level for sustainment numbers and bandsby AFSC. Banding permits equitable classification and distribution of accessions in times of over-age accessions or management of lower than optimum accession production. Banding may also beused as a management tool (i.e., metrics). 1.3.1.1.1.  The bands fall into three categories; green, yellow, and red. The green bands (clos-est to the sustainment number) form the window for acceptable accession inputs both in aggre-gate and in each AFSC. The yellow bands are outside of each green band and fall short of orexceed the acceptable accession input. Yellow band production can be offset if limited to oneor two consecutive years. The red bands are outside of each yellow band and indicate seriousshortfalls or overages. 1.3.1.1.2.  Every effort will be made to ensure production in each AFSC remains within thegreen band. But in some cases, accession levels outside of the green band may be appropriate.HQ USAF/DPL is the yellow band approval level for any programmatic actions within theaccession process. This includes actions such as adjustments to the LOAP or expected com-missioning source production that results in aggregate NRL accession levels outside the greenband. During classification, HQ AFPC/CC approves adjustments into the yellow bands for anyforecasted production outside the approved level. HQ USAF/DP approves any programmedaccessions into the red bands and will be notified if any AFSC is expected to access into eitherthe upper or lower red bands during classification. Agencies forwarding notification of yellowand red band accession levels will provide background information, as appropriate, and rec-ommended course of action coordinated with appropriate action agencies involved up throughto the approval level provided in the preceding paragraph. 1.3.1.1.3.  The following are some examples where accession levels outside of the green bandmay be appropriate. If a new officer career field is created, the initial accession levels may betemporarily in the higher red band. Or, in cases where a commissioning source has the avail-ability of excess hard-to-source officer candidates, accession levels may be temporarily raised.AFI36-2615   11 OCTOBER 20045These examples are not all inclusive. Other situations may exist that warrant accession levelsbeing set higher or lower than the green band. 1.3.1.1.4.  Color-coded AFSC bands for specialties with mandatory academic qualifications(degree and/or course work) for entry form the basis of mandatory academic bands. Sources ofcommission will use the top end of the green band as production targets for AFSCs with man-datory academic qualifications. 1.3.1.1.5.  USAFA, AFOATS, and Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS) will program ade-quate resources to meet these mandatory academic production targets for NRL production andreview progress as necessary. 1.3.1.1.6.  AF/DPLTS, AFOATS, USAFA, AFRS, and AFPC will review predicted productionup to two years before commissioning and are authorized to adjust production goals betweenthe sources of commission and AFRS to best meet production requirements. This may be donequarterly or as necessary to give the Air Force the best chance of meeting optimum accessiontargets. The best times may be shortly after cadets declare their degrees or right before AFRSselection boards. 1.3.2.  The primary consideration for setting accession production goals will be career field sustain-ment requirements. While accessing to meet career field requirements based on career field uniquecharacteristics is paramount, end strength cannot be overlooked. However, maintaining stabilizedaccession production and year groups gives the Air Force greater latitude when force shaping is nec-essary to meet end strength considerations. Likewise, deliberate employment of the appropriate forceshaping tools allows the Air Force to access the right number of officers each year, maintaining ahealthy force structure. Established goals help ensure commissioning sources access officers with therequisite education and skills to meet specialty sustainment requirements. When establishing programrequirements, Air Staff offices should not take actions that cause accession levels to reach unaccept-able levels without the appropriate approval as provided in paragraph 1.3.1.1.2. above. 1.3.3.  Commissioning sources shall make every effort to access to active duty the right number ofqualified officers in accordance with Air Force requirements. While the number of classified acces-sions in a given AFSC may fluctuate in and out of the green band throughout the fiscal year, AFPCshould not allow production to fall outside the acceptable range of accessions in any specialty at theend of the fiscal year without prior approval by the appropriate authority as provided in paragraph1.3.1.1.2. above. As provided in paragraph 1.3.1.1.2., commissioning sources may recommend acces-sion levels outside of the green band; however, they should not make irrevocable commitments untilafter approval. USAFA, AFROTC, and AFRS will ensure long-term programs and strategies are con-sistent with projected accession targets including the appropriate distribution of technical productionrequirements between commissioning and recruiting agencies. 6AFI36-2615   11 OCTOBER 2004Table 1.1.

Accession Sustainment Model. HQ USAF/DPX-AFPOA generates an accession sustainment planthat includes disaggregate accession targets. The output will include sustainment numbers and bands bycareer field, mandatory academic degree/coursework targets and bands, and proposed distribution andsource of commission targets. 3.2.1.  HQ USAF/DPX-AFPOA provides the accession sustainment plan to HQ USAF/DPLTS. 3.2.2.  HQ USAF/DPLTS reviews proposed accession sustainment and distribution plan and providesto HQ USAF/DPLTR, HQ USAF/DPLFR, HQ AFPC/DPPAO, HQ AETC/DOPZ, and Career FieldManagers. 3.2.3.  HQ USAF/DPLTS, HQ USAF/DPLFR, AF/DPX-AFPOA advises HQ USAF/DPL of anyLOAP changes, USAFA production changes, or other items that result in NRL officer accession levelsgoing outside the green band in order for HQ USAF/DPL to decide whether to maintain levels withinthe green band or not. 3.2.4.  HQ USAF/DPL is approval level for sustainment levels and bands by AFSC. 3.3.  Aggregate Accession Goals. HQ USAF/DPLFR publishes the LOAP, which provides HQ AETC/XP the maximum aggregate AFOATS production allowed to enter active duty in a particular fiscal year. 3.3.1.  HQ USAF/DPLFR coordinates with HQ USAF offices and commissioning sources, as neces-sary, to determine the officer accession production numbers. 3.3.2.  HQ USAF/DPLFR determines the LOAP based upon the difference between the AF accessionsustainment plan and the USAFA production projection. 3.3.3.  HQ USAF/DPLFR advises HQ USAF/DPL of any LOAP production requirements that resultin NRL officer accession levels going outside of the green band for decision on whether to maintainlevels within the green band or not. 3.3.3.1.  HQ USAF/DPX-AFPOA supports HQ USAF/DPL with analysis, as necessary, on theimpacts of accession levels on career field health and sustainment. 3.3.3.2.  LOAPs are not changed within two years of the production year without approval of HQUSAF/DP. This restriction is due to the difficulty in adjusting production inside the final two yearsof the production pipeline for AFROTC and the limited ability to change scheduled training. 3.3.4.  HQ AFOATS divides this LOAP target into AFROTC and OTS aggregate targets and providesto HQ USAF/DPLFR. As long as changes stay within the AFOATS LOAP and can be provided toAFRS at least 90 days before required implementation, HQ AFOATS is authorized to adjust AFROTCand OTS share of production during execution to meet AF specialty goals and academic targets. 3.3.5.  HQ USAF/DPLFR provides the aggregate accession goals to HQ USAF/DPLTS and HQUSAF/DPLFA. 3.3.6.  HQ USAF/DPLTS provides the aggregate accession goals to HQ USAF/DPX-AFPOA. AFI36-2615   11 OCTOBER 2004153.3.7.

HQ AFPC/DPPAO and HQ USAF/DPLTS co-host the annualNRLOAC normally scheduled for the first quarter of each FY. NRLOAC participants review sustainmentnumbers, accession targets and bands, and production forecasts and estimates. Any changes will beincluded in the NRLOAC minutes. Attendees ensure during the NRLOAC that discussions support thepolicy provided in AFPD 36-35, United States Air Force Academy. 3.4.1.  Attendees review USAFA and AFROTC mandatory degree production forecasts to determineAFRS targets. 3.4.2.  Functional communities and/or career field managers provide input to process agencies on spe-cific career field unique characteristics that impact sustainment requirement or accession process. 3.4.3.  HQ USAF/DPX-AFPOA provide the proposed AFSC accession sustainment targets and bandsto the career field managers or their representatives at least two weeks before the NRLOAC. 3.4.4.  HQ USAF/DPX-AFPOA presents the accession sustainment process and plan at the NRLOAC. 3.4.5.  Commissioning sources will review academic majors and predicted cadet production inAFROTC’s and USAFA’s senior and junior classes in order to provide HQ AFPC/DPPAO productionestimates. 3.4.5.1.  Commissioning sources and AFRS will use the review to refine mandatory academicrequirement shortfalls to align production goals to source of commission most capable to meet anyshortfalls. Between NRLOACs, VTCs will be used to review projected production. 3.4.5.2.  To help meet AF sustainment requirements, AFOATS will request AFRS adjust OTSentries to offset predicted overages or shortfalls in AFROTC and USAFA predicted production.AFOATS will ensure total AFROTC and OTS production remains within the LOAP. 3.4.5.3.  AFOATS will ensure any AFROTC over or under production in either technical ornon-technical degrees is balanced with a corresponding decrease or increase in OTS technical ornon-technical production. Air Force needs may allow under/over production in certain technical ornon-technical degrees, authorizing AFOATS to produce either below or above the LOAP.Non-technical production will not be substituted for technical production without approval fromHQ USAF/DPL. 3.4.5.4.  HQ USAF/DPLFA will consider any accession programs or incentives needed when pro-jected production falls short of targets. 3.4.5.5.  HQ USAF/DPLFA will monitor prior service commission opportunities to ensure theright mix of officers access each year. 3.4.6.  Review and discuss, as appropriate, other actions to ensure AFSC production targets are met. 3.4.6.1.  Other areas of consideration might include which source of commission is best suited toproduce technical officers or what is the proper mix of technical production across the sources ofcommission. 3.4.7.  HQ USAF/DPLTS prepares NRLOAC minutes for signature of HQ USAF/DPL. Attached tothe minutes are the approved mandatory academic requirement bands for compliance by the commis-16AFI36-2615   11 OCTOBER 2004sioning sources and AFSC bands/targets for use during AFSC classification actions by HQ AFPC/DPPAO. Dispatches minutes to NRLOAC participants. 3.4.7.1.  NRLOAC output products will be made available via windows based system for accessby NRLOAC participants including Functional Managers, Career Field Managers, FunctionalArea Managers, and Developmental Teams. 3.4.7.2.  HQ AFPC/DPPAO uses OTS targets to develop AFRS goals by AFSC for each OTSclass. 3.5.  Commissioning Sources Execution. Commissioning sources execute programs to motivate cadetsinto academic degree programs to meet Air Force NRL officer accession requirements. 3.5.1.  USAFA and HQ AFOATS provide projected production information as required by HQ AFPC/DPPAO and HQ USAF/DPLTS for use in preparing metric data. 3.5.1.1.  AFROTC, OTS, and AFRS may provide data directly to HQ AFPC/DPPAO. 3.5.2.  USAFA and AFOATS take actions necessary to access the right kinds and types of officers tomeet mandatory academic qualification requirements. As mandatory degree and course requirementproduction estimates become firmer, non-technical and AFRS requirements can be solidified. Sourcesof commission, AFRS, and AFPC are encouraged to maintain appropriate contact and make changesas needed to ensure total degree and course work targets are realized. 3.5.3.  Commissioning sources may recommend, in some cases, that accession levels be set outside ofthe green band in accordance with paragraph 1.3.1.1.2. One example might be where a commissioningsource has extra hard-to-source officer candidates. Recommended/approved changes must be coordi-nated with HQ AFPC/DPPAO and HQ USAF/DPLTS with a courtesy copy to HQ AETC/DOP. 3.5.4.  Commissioning sources will coordinate any changes to production estimates or tasked sourceof commission with HQ AFPC/DPPAO and HQ USAF/DPLTS with a courtesy copy to HQ AETC/DOPZ. 3.5.4.1.  HQ AFPC/DPPAO will check changes against the NRLOAC approved plan, ensurechanges are within acceptable limits by AFSC, and confirm total source of commission productionnumbers are appropriate. 3.5.4.2.  HQ AFPC/DPPAO will provide updated AFRS entry requirements to match any adjust-ments to OTS production targets with at least 90 days notice before required implementation date. 3.5.4.3.  HQ USAF/DPLTS advises HQ USAF/DPLTR, HQ USAF/DPLFR, HQ USAF/DPX-AFPOA, and HQ AFPC/DPPAO as needed. 3.5.4.4.

Program Guidance Letter. HQ USAF/DPLTR prepares the NRL OIS PGLs. 3.6.1.  HQ AFPC/DPPAO determines the projected training requirements for NRL officer careerfields. The most accurate AFSC distribution projections will be used to size the accession portion ofAFI36-2615   11 OCTOBER 200417the training requirement to ensure sufficient training is programmed and available. In absence of accu-rate AFSC distribution projections, the sustainment requirements by AFSC will be used. 3.6.2.  HQ USAF/DPLTR uses projected initial skills training requirements and career field sustain-ment and distribution plan to prepare the NRL OIS PGLs. 3.7.  Monitor Accessions. HQ AFPC/DPPAO monitors execution (production) for the sources of com-mission by counting the number of expected and actual accessions provided in each specialty. 3.7.1.  Provides appropriate monthly metrics/data to HQ USAF/DPLT and HQ USAF/DPLF. 3.7.2.  When the forecast report predicts accession levels in any specialty to be outside the approvedband at the end of the fiscal year, HQ AFPC/DPPAO will staff recommended courses of action orrequest for approval along with background information to the appropriate approval authority. 3.7.3.  HQ USAF/DPLFA monitors the aggregate accession program. 3.7.4.  HQ USAF/DPLTS monitors skills accession sustainment and provides quarterly updates toCFMs. 3.7.5.

AFOATS fiscal year-production may20AFI36-2615   11 OCTOBER 2004differ from AFOATS accessions entering active duty during the same fiscal year due to carry-over fromone fiscal year to another. The LOAP will not be changed within two years of commissioning without HQUSAF/DP approval due to the difficulty in adjusting production inside the final two years of theproduction pipeline for AFROTC and the limited ability to change scheduled training. Mandatory Academic Requirement—Academic degree or courses required to enter a technical AFSC,as specified in AFMAN 36-2105, Officer Classification. Non-line (NL)—As referred to in this AFI, non-line officers are officers classified into the Medical careerareas (Medical Corps (MC), Dental Corps (DC), Medical Service Corps (MSC), Biomedical SciencesCorps (BSC), and Nurse Corps (NC)) and into the Professional career areas (Judge Advocate GeneralOfficers (JAG) and Chaplain (CHAP)).

Further clarificationof career areas is provided in Air Force Manual 36-2105, Officer Classification. NRL Officer Accession Sustainment Process—Employs objective modeling to determine NRL officeraccession targets for each AFSC and mandatory academic category, based on the calculated sustainmentrequirement for each AFSC. Once the model produces the targets, process agencies validate/revise thetargets during the NRLOAC. Process agencies—Agencies actively involved in the process to access and classify newly commissionedofficers into NRL specialties and allocate sufficient resources to provide initial skills training for everynew officer requiring such training. These agencies include Headquarters United States Air Force DeputyChief of Staff for Personnel (HQ USAF/DPLT and HQ USAF/DPLF), Headquarters Air Force PersonnelCenter, Headquarters Air Education and Training Command, Headquarters Air University, Headquarters2nd Air Force, Headquarters Recruiting Service, Headquarters Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps,the United States Air Force Academy, and Headquarters Air Force Officer Accession and TrainingSchools. Rated—Pilot, navigator, and air battle manager. Recore—When the officer moves from one AFSC to a new AFSC and is released from the previousAFSC with no expectations of returning. Red Band—Accessions exceeding the upper limit of the acceptable range by a percentage (greater thanthe yellow band percentage) based on sustainment or falling short of the lower limit of the samepercentage shall be designated the red band and requires close coordination between process agencies,career field managers, and functional managers. All AFSC red band accession projections shall requireHQ AFPC/CC and HQ USAF/DPL notification and HQ USAF/DP approval. Requirement—For the purposes of this AFI, requirement is defined as authorized billets minus assignedpersonnel, plus tasked billets drawing personnel from core AFSC positions. Tasked billets include careerbroadening and joint assignments, in-residence professional military education, internships outside thecore career field, etc. Source of Commission (SOC) —Commissioning source. The Air Force commissioning sources are theUnited States Air Force Academy (USAF), Officer Training School (OTS), and the Air Force ReserveOfficer Training Corps (AFROTC). In certain circumstances, AFOATS acts on behalf of OTS andAFI36-2615   11 OCTOBER 200421AFROTC. Sustainment—Required number of officers throughout the career field to accomplish the mission.Accounts for authorized versus assigned billets, retention rates, career broadening and professionalmilitary education assignments drawing officers from core AFSC billets. Calculations for sustainmentincorporate “career field health” considerations. Technical AFSC—Air Force specialty with mandatory education (undergraduate academic degree orcourse) requirements as specified in AFMAN 36-2105, Officer Classification.  Trained Personnel Requirement (TPR)—(1) The number of officer or enlisted personnel programmedfor post-commissioning initial skills training or post-BMT technical training to meet Air Force specialtyrequirements and (2) the document containing the number of officer or enlisted personnel programmed forpost-commissioning initial skills training or post-BMT technical training to meet Air Force specialtyrequirements. Yellow Band—Accessions and degrees exceeding the upper limit of the acceptable range by a percentagebased on sustainment or falling short of the lower limit by the same percentage shall be designated theyellow band and requires coordination among the process agencies, career field managers, and functionalmanagers. Following coordination, AFSC yellow band accession/degree projections require HQ USAF/DPL approval/disapproval in the programming phase and HQ AFPC/CC approval/disapproval in theexecution phase. The programming phase occurs as accession levels are programmed for the future at theAir Staff and the execution phase deals with the current year classifications and distribution at AFPC.
