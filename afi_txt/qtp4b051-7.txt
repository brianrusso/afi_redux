Conduct hands-on training and evaluation. Given activity assessment data and listed references, determine or establish an air sampling strategy successfully completing all checklist items with limited assistance on only the hardest parts. Notes: *For this QTP the assumption has been made that if an air sampling strategy is needed then there is a need for further (specialized) assessment, thus a less than desirable level of confidence in hazard characterization exists. To identify a course of action (strategy), you must first identify the gap in data that is causing the lack of confidence. A good sampling strategy makes use of both worst-case and typical sampling methods, each selected to answer the questions what, where, when, how, and whom to sample.  **Hazard characterization task steps are outlined in TRAINING MODULE (4.2.2), which is listed as a prerequisite to this QTP. Successful completion of TRAINING MODULE (4.2.2) helps to ensure the trainee is better suited to comprehend and relate the rationale for developing air sampling strategies.  ***29 CFR 1910.10xx refers to all sections of 1910 which address toxic and hazardous substances, e.g., 1910.1017 discusses vinyl chloride.      1  AFQTP 4B051-7                          Journeyman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling   TASK STEPS  1.  Identify the project hazard of concern and gather details1. 2.  Determine goal for sampling (detailed analysis vs. screening). 3.  Define the population at risk. 4.  Select employee(s) to be sampled considering observations, established goal/purpose for sampling and data gap2. 5.  Research contaminants of concern gathering information such as regulatory requirements, chemical characteristics, occupational exposure limit (OEL), and sampling methodology, etc. 6.  Select measurement type (i.e., full period, partial period, etc) 3. 7.  Identify/consider occupational exposure variations (day to day, shift to shift, seasonal, etc). 8.  Identify/consider accuracy of sampling and analytical methods. 9.  Identify/consider number of samples needed to attain the required accuracy of the exposure measurement. 10.  Select measurement location. 11.  Select shift to be sampled. 12.  Select collection method. 13.  Determine sampling rates and volumes. 4 14.  Determine sample frequency.5  15. Utilize DOEHRS or equivalent.   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:       NOTES: 1.  Observe activity; review existing activity assessment data and determine confidence in hazard characterization; and identify why confidence is less than desirable (data gap--what information is missing).  2.  Select the maximum risk employee for each work operation based on proximity and length of exposure to the hazardous substance -or- Identify random individuals in each homogeneous work group where a max risk employee cannot be identified. When using the random individual approach, tables 3.1 and 3.2 in NIOSH Publication No. 77-173, or other random number selection process can be used to determine the required number of employees.    3.  When selecting the measure type, you will need to consider regulatory requirements, expected contaminant concentrations, and the applicable OEEL type (8-hour TWA vs. 15-minute short-term exposure limit [STEL]).   4.  It is up to you to decide rates and volumes that are within the recommended ranges based on such things as the goal for sampling, how much time you have to sample, and the concentration of contaminant you expect to encounter in the area of concern. You can calculate how long you must collect a sample using the following formula: Volumeliters = flowratelpm x timemin  which can be restated to solve for how long you must collect a sample as Timemin = Volumeliters                                     Flowrate1pm  5.  Sampling frequency is based on the following:   •  Regulatory requirements. •  Characterization needs. •  Substances exceeding the standard. 2 AFQTP 4B051-7                          Journeyman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling   TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS      STS Line Item 4.5.2.4:  Determine or establish air sampling strategies 1.

Insert an unopened detector tube into the pump socket. 2.  Squeeze the pump completely and release. 3.  After 15 minutes, look for the end-of-stroke indicator.1 4.  If the pump is deemed leak-proof, remove the tube and reset the counter on the pump to zero.   PREPARE AND OPERATE ACCURO® PUMP WITH DETECTOR TUBES: 1.  Determine which set tubes will be used for sampling.2 2.  Open detector tubes only on pump side first (direction of arrow). 3 3.  Insert the open ends of the tube(s) into the tube adapter (flow arrows pointing in). 4.  Score and break off tips on other side of set.  5.  Activate the cyanogen chloride tube (Simultest Set V only).4 6.  Connect the tube set to pump.5 7.  Check stroke number.6 8.  Operate the pump.7 9.  Complete sampling.8 10.  Remove the used tubes from the adapter and dispose of them correctly.9 11.  Purge pump.10  RECORD DATA: 1.  Utilize DOEHRS or equivalent as applicable.     LOCAL REQUIREMENTS: N/A  NOTES: 1.  If the end-of-stroke indicator does not appear, the pump is leak-proof and you are ready to continue. If the end-of-stroke indicator appears, your pump is not leak-proof and therefore should not be used.   2.  Some tubes contain ampoules that require additional steps, in these circumstances, refer to laminated card for specific instructions. The laminated instruction cards provide a quick reference for easy use and color change interpretations specific to each ampoule (detector tube). The laminated instruction cards also provide reference for groups of related contaminants.  3.  Tube Opener Procedures:  A.  Simultest Tube Opener: •  Carefully scrape the ceramic edge of the tube set opener against the ends of the tubes (at an angle) multiple times to score all five glass tips. •  With the ceramic cutter UP, push opener completely over rubber tube block and apply pressure down until all tube tips break off (if some tubes don’t break off, re-scrape or use the singe-tube breaker, described below).    13 AFQTP 4B051-7                          Journeyman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling   B.  Deluxe Tube Opener (for individual tubes): Insert the tube into the cutter. Keep it pressed against the ceramic edge while turning it (scoring it). • •  To open the tube, insert the tube into the opener and push on it at an angle until the tip breaks off (dispose of glass tip).  C.  Pump Tube Opener (for individual tubes): •  To score and open an individual tube using the opener on the Accuro® pump; insert the tube into the opener. Press the tube against the ceramic edge while turning it to score the glass; then pull the tube at an angle until the tip breaks off (dispose of glass tip).  •  When using the pump to open a tube, be sure to keep the pump facing downwards to prevent any glass splinters from entering the pump.   4.  Before beginning the test using the Simultest Set V detector tubes, you will need to activate the cyanogen chloride tube. Remove the tub from the holder and bend the tube between the two black dots, allowing the reagent to flow onto the indicator until it is moistened. Place the tube back into the test holder, always keeping the arrows on the tube pointing towards the pump.   5.  A special adapter is used to connect the Simultest Set to the pump. This adapter consists of a 5-slot manifold for the tube sets, 1 meter extension hose that connects to the Accuro® pump.  6.  The number of strokes required is stated on the back of the Simultest Set holder and is also included in the Instructions for Use. Conveniently, both Simultest Set I and V require 50 strokes.   7.  Grip and hold the Accuro® pump so that the end-of-stroke indicator and stroke counter are facing you. Squeeze the pump until it is fully compressed (the stroke indicator will advance) then release to allow the bellows to re-expand by itself until. A white dot reappears on the top of the pump and indicates re-expansion is complete (end of stroke).   8.

The sample probe assembly is a hand-held device that enables you to take vapor samples at precise locations. It connects to the instrument by means of an umbilical. The umbilical has two quick-disconnect fasteners (one electrical, one sample line) at the instrument end.  2.  The FID mode is used to detect most organic compounds and can be used to detect gaseous hydrocarbons in depressions or confined spaces. It is best suited to detect combustible compounds such as gasoline and methane. The PID mode is sensitive to compounds with double bonds, such as aromatic and chlorinated compounds. It can also measure some inorganic compounds that the FID does not detect, such as ammonia, carbon disulfide, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ethylamine, formaldehyde, and hydrogen sulfide. Calibration must be completed each day the TVA-1000B is used. The FID is calibrated with methane and the PID is calibrated with isobutylene. To refill the hydrogen tank, follow these steps: 1.  Turn the supply tank valve to OFF. 2.  Attach the tank filler adapter to the supply cylinder with valve and manifold valves in OFF position. 3.  Attach the TVA-1000B hydrogen tank to the tank filler adapter (left hand thread-do not over tighten). 4.  Open the supply tank valve. 5.  Move the fill adapter valve to FILL position. 6.  Wait for TVA-1000B tank to fill (may take two to three minutes because of flow restrictors in the tank and fill adapter). Do not fill past 2200psi. 7.  Once full, close the fill adapter valve. 8.  Remove the TVA-1000B tank. 9.  Close the supply cylinder valve. 10.  Reopen the adapter valve to release gas remaining in tank fill adapter (removes pressure and makes adapter removal easier). 11.  Remove the tank fill adapter. (Always remove tank from instrument for storage.)         3.  Calibration must be completed each day the TVA-1000B is used. Prior to performing calibration, the instrument must be on and warmed up for approximately 30 minutes. The pump must be ON, the PID lamp must be ON, and the FID must be ignited throughout the warm-up period.   4.  If PID only, enter concentration of isobutylene. If FID only, enter concentration of methane. If dual, enter concentration  5.  To power down this instrument, press and hold the OFF key. With FID versions, you must also shut off the gas valve to of both gases. avoid depleting the tank supply. 21 AFQTP 4B051-7                          Journeyman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling    TVA-1000B    *Key Functions: ON:  The ON key enables power from the battery to the instrument.

Which detector(s) within the TVA-1000B is/are able to distinguish inorganic material?    A:  Photoionization Detector  (Source: Bioenvironmental Engineer’s Guide to TVA-1000B) 2.  How should the TVA-1000B be decontaminated?    A:  The TVA-1000B can be decontaminated by wiping the exterior with a moist towel.  Do NOT decontaminate the TVA-1000B by submerging it in water.  If the TVA-1000B is accidentally contaminated by drawing a liquid sample into the probe head, it is recommended to call the manufacturer, Thermo Fisher Scientific.  (Source: Bioenvironmental Engineer’s Guide to TVA-1000B)  3.  How does the ion potential (IP) directly relate to the detection capabilities of the TVA-1000B?    A:  Dependent upon what lamp (10.6 eV or 11.8 eV) is installed for the PID will correlate to the detection of the chemical in question.  For example, acetaldehyde has an IP of 10.21 therefore it can be detected by either a 10.6 eV or an 11.8 eV PID lamp but chlorine has an IP of 11.47 so it cannot be detected by the 10.6 eV.  An 11.8eV lamp would have to be used.  (Source: Bioenvironmental Engineer’s Guide to TVA-1000B)  4.  How is the response factor calculated?

Given a HAPSITE® (GC/MS), perform pre-operational check and operate instrument successfully completing all checklist items with NO trainer assistance. Notes: *The HAPSITE® is a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) proven to provide verifiable data for critical health-risk decisions. The HAPSITE® systems deliver fast, dependable on-site analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air, water, and soil for emergency response, environmental, hazardous waste, industrial hygiene, process monitoring, and medical applications. The HAPSITE® Headspace sampling system supports the HAPSITE® Smart Chemical Identification System in detecting and identifying VOCs in water or soil on-site or from another location.  INFICON recommends storing the HAPSITE® Smart in extended standby mode. This keeps the NEG (pump) operating at 400°C and the ion pump ON to maintain proper vacuum conditions. Extended standby ensures the battery is charged and ready for deployment/response. While extended standby is recommended, it is not a substitute for system use and it is not a feature to extend the time period between system operations. Using the system or running a weekly Blank Run is the best method to ensure overall operational readiness.  The Guidance Document (HAPSITE® Field Guide) referenced above is designed to provide user’s the capability to maximize the use of deployment technology at both garrison and deployed environments in both routine and emergency response situations.          27 AFQTP 4B051-7                          Journeyman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling   TASK STEPS  START UP FROM STANDBY MODE: (These steps are ONLY for resuming use when the HAPSITE® has been placed in STANDBY MODE.) 1.

Time and date (if data logging option installed) e.  Last CAL date (if data logging option installed) —The Sirius® Multigas Detector is equipped with a “last successful calibration date” feature. The date shown is the last date that all installed sensors were successfully calibrated. LAST CAL is displayed with this date in the following format: MM/DD/YY f. Instrument warm-up period g.  Fresh Air Setup (FAS) option.  2. Persons responsible for the use of the Sirius® Multigas Detector must determine whether or not the Fresh Air Setup option should be used. The user's abilities, training and normal work practices must be considered when making this decision.     Warning: Do not activate the Fresh Air Setup unless you are certain you are in fresh, uncontaminated air; otherwise, inaccurate readings can occur which can falsely indicate that a hazardous atmosphere is safe. If you have any doubts as to the quality of the surrounding air, do not use the Fresh Air Setup feature. Do not use the Fresh Air Setup as a substitute for daily calibration checks. The calibration check is required to verify span accuracy. Failure to follow this warning can result in serious personal injury or death.  To perform a Fresh Air Setup, push the ON/OFF button while ZERO? is flashing. The Fresh Air Setup (FAS) has limits. If a hazardous level of gas is present, the Sirius® Multigas Detector ignores the FAS command and goes into alarm. Once the instrument self check is complete, ZERO? flashes for 10 seconds.  If no buttons are pushed, the ZERO? automatically stops flashing after the 10 seconds have expired and the FAS is not performed. To immediately skip the FAS, push the RESET/       button.   3. The pump motor will start fast and then slows down as the instrument adjusts the power to run the pump.  4. If the pump motor shuts down and an alarm sounds, PUMP ALARM will flash on the display and the readings on the display may change. When the pump inlet, sample line or probe is blocked, the pump alarm must activate. If the alarm does not activate, check the sample line and probe for leaks. Once leak is fixed, re-check pump alarm by blocking flow.    5. Warning: Perform a blocked flow test before each day’s use. Do not use the pump, sample line, or probe unless the pump alarm activates when the flow is blocked. Lack of an alarm is an indication that a sample may not be drawn to the sensors, which could cause inaccurate readings. Failure to follow the above can result in serious personal injury or death. During operation, a pump alarm may occur when the flow system is blocked, pump is inoperative, and sample lines are attached or removed.  When the instrument is in a gas alarm, the pump alarm may not display until gas alarm is cleared.   6. The presence of other calibration gases may cause the PID to under range, indicated by dashes for the displayed VOC reading.  43 AFQTP 4B051-7                          Journeyman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling    7. The reading on the Sirius® Multigas Detector display should be within the limits stated on the calibration cylinder or limits which are predetermined by the user. If necessary, change cylinder to introduce other calibration gases. If readings are not within these limits, the Sirius Multigas Detector requires recalibration.    8. Instrument must be in fresh air to perform the zero. CAL ZERO flashes. To skip the Zero procedure and move directly to the calibration span procedure, push the RESET/       button. If no button is pushed for 30 seconds, the instrument returns to the Measure mode. Once the zeros are set, CAL SPAN? flashes    9. CAL SPAN flashes for approximately 90 seconds. If autocalibration sequence passes, the instrument beeps three times and returns to the Measure mode. To skip calibration and return to the Measure mode, push the RESET/       button. If no button is pushed for 30 seconds, it will return to the Measure page.    10.  Warning: Never let the end of the sampling line touch or go under any liquid surface. If liquid is sucked into the instrument, readings will be inaccurate and the instrument could be damaged. We recommend the use of an MSA Sample Probe (P/N 10042621, 10042622, 10040589, or equivalent) containing a special membrane filter, permeable to gas but impermeable to water, to prevent such an occurrence. The Sirius® Multigas Detector can be equipped to detect combustible gases in the atmosphere.  a.  Alarms sound when concentrations reach: i. ii. Alarm Setpoint or 100% LEL (Lower Explosive Limit), 5% CH4.  b.  When the combustible gas indication reaches the Alarm Setpoint: Alarm sounds Alarm lights flash i. ii. iii.  % LEL or CH4 flag above the concentration flashes.  c.  To silence the alarm, press the RESET/       button.  The alarm will stay silent if the alarm condition has cleared. d.  When the combustible gas indication reaches 100% LEL or 5% CH4, the LockAlarm™ circuit locks the combustible gas reading and alarm and: i. ii. iii. Alarm sounds Alarm lights flash 100 (or 5.00 in CH4 mode) appears on the display and flashes.  e.  This alarm cannot be reset with the RESET/       button. After moving to a safe, fresh-air environment, reset the alarm by turning OFF the instrument and turning it ON again. To determine a response factor for a target chemical, perform the following procedure: 44       AFQTP 4B051-7                          Journeyman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling        1.  Calibrate the Sirius Detector using isobutylene as the span gas. 2.  On the monitor, set the sample gas name to isobutylene. 3.  Apply a known concentration of the target chemical to the monitor and note the concentration reported in the display.  4.  The response factor for the target chemical relative to isobutylene: RF target gas =      Actual known concentration                              Concentration reported by instrument    For example:  A monitor is calibrated on isobutylene, and has isobutylene defined as the sample gas. When sampling 106 ppm of benzene in air, the instrument reports a concentration of 200 ppm. In this example, the response factor for benzene relative to isobutylene would be:  RF benz = 106 ppm known conc. benzene = 0.53                        200 ppm reported  When surveying, if benzene is selected as the sample gas in the Response Factor page, and 0.53 is entered into the monitor as the response factor, the instrument would use this response factor to automatically correct the displayed concentration into PPM benzene.  If a chemical has a response factor between zero and one, the monitor has a higher detector response for this chemical than isobutylene. If the response factor is greater than one, the monitor has a lower detector response for this chemical than isobutylene.     11. The STEL alarm is calculated over a 15-minute exposure. Calculation examples are as follows:  • Assume the detector has been running for at least 15 minutes:         • 15-minute exposure of 35 PPM: (15 minutes x 35 PPM) = 35 PPM 15 minutes • 10-minute exposure of 35 PPM • 5-minute exposure of 15 PPM: (10 minutes x 35 PPM) + (5 minutes x 15 PPM) = 28 PPM 15 minutes      45 AFQTP 4B051-7                          Journeyman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling    12. The TWA alarm is calculated over an eight-hour exposure. Calculation examples are as follows:  • 1-hour exposure of 50 PPM: (1 hour x 50 PPM) + (7 hours x 0 PPM) = 6.25 PPM • 4-hour exposure of 50 PPM 4-hour exposure of 100 PPM: (4 hours x 50 PPM) + (4 hours x100 PPM) = 75 PPM • 12-hour exposure of 100 PPM: (12 hours x 100 PPM) = 150 PPM 8 hours  8 hours  8 hours        NOTE: The accumulated reading is always divided by eight hours.

Turn on pump and allow to run for 5 minutes before calibration. 2.  Check the battery. 3.  Assemble sample train. TASK STEPS  •  Determine sample media. • Identify proper air flow direction through sample media. Attach the outlet end of the sample media to the inlet valve on the pump with a piece of Tygon tubing of adequate length. •  Assemble the components of the sample train as shown in the Fundamentals of Industrial Hygiene, Figure 16-16. 4.  Identify the components of the calibration apparatus: burette, burette stand, and beaker of soap solution? 5.  Determine calibration volume and calculate time (T) for a bubble to run the volume (see notes 1 & 2). 6.  Clean the burette and wet the inside with soap solution or water. 7.  Assemble the components of the calibration apparatus as shown in the Fundamentals of Industrial Hygiene, Figure 16-17.3 (100mL or 1,000mL). 8.  Draw two or three bubbles up the length of the burette to ensure at least one bubble completes its run. 9.  Adjust pump rotometer, if available, to desired flow rate. 10.  Draw a soap bubble and, using a stop watch, measure the time it takes to get from zero to the desired calibration volume 11.  Adjust the flow rate if the time is not within the range of accuracy (within ±1of the time corresponding to the desired flow rate)? 12.  Once correct flow rate is obtained, repeat the determination at least twice. 13.  Calculate the average flow rate. 14.  Record the following calibration data:  volumes measured, elapsed times, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, make, model, and serial number of sampling pump, collection device used, name, date, and time of person performing calibration.   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS: In instances where trainee is using manufacturer’s instructions to calibrate an air sampling pump, it is recommended that the trainer develop an internal checklist following the manufacturer’s instructions to evaluate the trainee.    NOTES:  1.  To calibrate high-volume pumps use the 0 to 1000 ml mark.  To calibrate low-flow pumps use 0 to 100 ml mark.  2.

When should air sampling equipment be calibrated?  A:  Always calibrate the air sampling equipment before starting any sample collection. A post calibration is performed after sampling is complete. This should be performed before recharging the pump.  (Source:  Career Development Course 4B051, Bioenvironmental Engineering Journeyman)  2.  Why must you use the same media for calibration as you do for sampling?  A:  It is important that the sampling train contain the same type of media that will be used to conduct air sampling because each media causes a different/unique pressure drop; the pressure drop can affect the sampling pump’s flow rate  (Source:  Career Development Course 4B051, Bioenvironmental Engineering Journeyman)  3.  Why would a secondary calibration device be used?  A:  Secondary standards are typically used to calibrate sampling pumps in the field when it is inconvenient or impractical to use a primary standard.  (Source:  Career Development Course 4B051, Bioenvironmental Engineering Journeyman)   4.  How and when can a rotometer be used for evaluation of pump efficiency?  A:  They can be used to estimate whether a pump is still pulling the same airflow it was when it was calibrated. After calibration, mark the position of the rotameter so it can be periodically checked while sampling. If collecting consecutive samples, a good time to do this is when switching media.

Notes: *This QTP is limited to the task steps involved in collecting area air samples using indirect instruments – high volume sampling pumps. Area samples can be used to provide a good indication of the airborne concentration of a contaminant in a room/area over a relatively long time (extended sampling operations).

Identify air sampling strategy.1 2. Select appropriate sampling pump.2  3. Place pump in pre-determined sampling location.3 4. Perform initial operation check of sampling pump. 5. Attach and configure sampling media correctly.4 6. Turn on pump and record start time. 7. Prepare blank samples. 8. Replace media, as necessary.5 9. Check sampling pump periodically during sampling to ensure the pump is still pulling the desired flow rate. 10. Record pertinent sampling data throughout the sampling event.6 11. Turn off pump at the end of the sampling period. 12. Remove and seal final media from sampling train and properly label.  13. Perform post-calibration process, if necessary.7  14. Utilize OEHMIS (DOEHRS or equivalent) as applicable.  LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:    NOTES: 1.  Prior to conducting sampling, a sampling strategy should be developed to measure the “worst case” in accordance with task steps outlined in Journeyman Training Module OEH 5-1.   2.  The desired flow rate will determine the sampling pump required. The sampling pump used to collect the sample must be compatible with the sampling needs and the media used. Specifically, the pump must be capable of maintaining the desired flow rate over the time period needed using the sampling media specified. Also, pumps that are to be used in potentially explosive atmospheres must be “intrinsically safe.”  3.  Some sampling events may require pumps to be calibrated using the specified media prior to conducting area air sampling. Calibration task steps are covered in Journeyman Training Module OEH 5-4. Not all area sampling situations will require pumps to be pre-calibrated, for example, when sampling for radiological contamination during a broken arrow incident,  you simply annotate the flow rate when the pump is turned on and off.   4.  The sampling method will dictate any special requirements for configuring media (e.g., angle or height).   5.  Cap/seal media and properly label each sample as it is removed from the sample train.  6.  Pertinent data includes: Sampling narrative, start/stop times for each sample; initial and final air temperatures; relative humidity; and atmospheric pressure.   7.  After sampling where sampling strategy required a specified flow rate, before you recharge the pump, perform the same calibration steps, outlined in Journeyman Training OEH Module 5-4, to ensure the flow rate did not change. If it has changed, use the lowest flow rate of the two for calculating the volume collected because that is the most conservative.     56 AFQTP 4B051-7                          Journeyman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling   TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS       STS Line Item 4.5.2.8:  Collect area air samples 1.

A:  You should remain at the workplace during the entire air sampling process so you can monitor the pump’s flow rate, sampling train and make noteworthy observations concerning the process.  (Source:  Career Development Course 4B051)  3.  Under what circumstances would collection of a breathing zone air sample continue during a worker’s lunch time?  A:  You do not normally sample during lunch unless the person stays in the area of concern. If they do not stay in the area, turn the pump off at the start of the lunch period and seal or remove the sample media to prevent cross-contamination. It is not always necessary to remove the rest of the sampling train unless the individual prefers to remove the pump and tube during lunch. After lunch, resume sampling with the same media or use new media (if you have reached or are close to reaching the maximum air volume). If you do not sample during lunch, the time is not used in your TWA calculations.  (Source:  Career Development Course 4B051)   4.  What, if any, pertinent data will be documented?

Notes: *OEELs are based on the assumption that exposure occurs for an 8-hour period after which the body is no longer exposed but allowed to recover for the next 16 hours. Where the worker is exposed for more than 8-hours in a day, these assumptions do not hold true. Numerous biological factors come into play when adjusting the OEEL. The booklet produced each year by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist (ACGIH), Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) and Biological Exposure Indices (BEIs), should be consulted to ensure it is appropriate to adjust the limit. For example, it is unnecessary to adjust limits where they are based on odor. Although limits can be adjusted downwards to accommodate longer periods of exposure, standards can never be adjusted upwards to accommodate shorter periods of exposure.       66 AFQTP 4B051-7                          Journeyman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling   TASK STEPS    1.  Select appropriate OEEL. 2.  Determine total number of hours worked.1 3.  Select the appropriate equation.2 4.  Substitute hours worked per day (h) or week (hw) into the equation. 5.  Solve to determine equivalent OEEL.   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:     NOTES: 1.  Most often exposure limits are based on the conventional 8-hour day and 40-hour week. When you encounter non-standard (extended) work shifts, OEELs may be adjusted to account for the longer exposures. Adjustments can be made for both daily and weekly exposures.   2.

Notes: *When you receive your air sampling results back from the analytical laboratory, in most cases you will need to calculate the TWA and compare the results to the applicable OEEL. For those cases where the laboratory uses the air volume you provided and calculates the concentration in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3) or parts per million (ppm), at normal temperature and pressure (NTP), no corrections are required; you can simply compare your results directly to the applicable OEEL as long as the OEEL is in the same units. If the units are not the same, you will need to use one of the formulas provided below to convert to the same units as the OEEL:  mg/m3 or ppm.  In situations where the laboratory reported your results as a weight of contaminant collected on the sample media, such as milligrams (mg) or micrograms (µg), these results cannot be compared to the OEEL. When this happens, you must first determine the volume of air drawn through the sample then calculate the mass/volume concentration in mg/m3.  Remember, the units must be the same in order to make a comparison.      71 AFQTP 4B051-7                          Journeyman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling   TASK STEPS  1.

Notes: *The time-weighted average (TWA) exposure evolved as a method to calculate daily or full-shift average exposures, given that individuals’ job tasks may vary during a day and that facility operating conditions can also vary. In typical work environments, individuals may experience several different, short-term exposures to the same material. By taking a time-weighted average of these exposures, you can estimate the short-term measurements into an 8-hour exposure estimate and compare this to the applicable standard.      78 AFQTP 4B051-7                          Journeyman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling    TASK STEPS   1.  Determine concentration (C) of a given substance based on air sampling results. 2.  Determine the collection time in hours (T) for each concentration. 3.  Select the appropriate equation.  4.  Calculate an 8-hour TWA.1 5.  Calculate a 15-minute TWA.2   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  NOTES:  1.  The time-weighted average is determined by the following formula, where  C = concentration of the contaminant T = time period during which this concentration was measured  8ℎ𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑟𝑟 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝐴𝐴= 𝐶𝐶1 𝑇𝑇1+ 𝐶𝐶2𝑇𝑇2+ 𝐶𝐶𝑛𝑛𝑇𝑇𝑛𝑛8 ℎ𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴               2.  A 15-minute TWA is typically referred to as a short-term exposure limit (STEL). The STEL is the concentration of the contaminant to which it is believed that workers can be exposed for a short period of time without suffering from 1) irritation, 2) chronic or irreversible tissue damage, 3) dose-rate-dependent toxic effects, or 4) loss of feeling or consciousness.  When a chemical has a STEL listed, it cannot be exceeded in a 15-minute period. The 15-minute TWA (STEL) is determined by the following formula, where  C = concentration of the contaminant T = time period during which this concentration was measured  15𝑉𝑉𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠𝑉𝑉𝑅𝑅𝑉𝑉 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝐴𝐴 (𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑇𝐸𝐸𝐿𝐿)= 𝐶𝐶1 𝑇𝑇1+ 𝐶𝐶2𝑇𝑇2+ 𝐶𝐶𝑛𝑛𝑇𝑇𝑛𝑛15 𝑉𝑉𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠𝑉𝑉𝑅𝑅𝑉𝑉𝐴𝐴               Note:  Exposures above the 8-hour TWA and below the 15-minute STEL should not be exceeded more than four times in an 8-hour workday, and there should be at least 60-minutes between successive STEL exposures.        79 AFQTP 4B051-7                          Journeyman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling   TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS     STS Line Item 4.5.2.12:  Calculate time-weighted averages 1.

Obtain laboratory results of analyte(s) sample 2. Determine the standard concentration of the analyte(s) and the sampling procedure information1 3. Identify the sampling and analytical error (SAE) factor for the analyte(s) 2 4. Calculate the upper confidence limit (UCL) 3 5. Calculate the lower confidence limit (LCL) 4 6. Recognize when the OEEL could be exceeded5 7. Utilize OEHMIS (DOEHRS or equivalent), as applicable.   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:     NOTES:   1. The standardized concentration of an analyte takes into consideration random fluctuations of its presence throughout the sampling process. This variation is expressed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as SrT which is an equivalent term indicating the measure of precision. It can be found in the NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods. The standardized concentration, therefore, can be expressed by the following formula where Y equals standardized concentration and X equals the full period sampling result obtained in step one:               Y =    X                     OEEL  The occupational exposure limit can be found in the ACGIH TLV Booklet. It is expressed as either a time-weighted average (TWA) or as a short-term exposure limit (STEL). The sampling results obtained will determine which value to use based on the sampling procedure.  2. The SAE is expressed by multiplying the precision measurement obtained in the NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods by the statistical constant 1.645. In other words, an SAE is found by the SrT multiplied by 1.645, e.g., the SAE of methylene chloride is 0.042 (SrT = 0.026 x 1.645).       SAE = SrT   x 1.645  3. The formula to calculate the upper confidence level (UCL) is the following:  4. The formula to calculate the lower confidence limit (LCL) is as follows:  UCL = Y + SAE  LCL = Y – SAE    5. If the TWA is already above the OEEL, there is no need to calculate the UCL; however, an LCL should be calculated. If the SAE results in a UCL of more than 1, it is not clear whether the exposure was in compliance. An error of method could make it unclear as to if the exposure was too high.  • • • If the UCL < 1, it is with 95 percent confidence that an overexposure does not exist. If the LCL < 1 and the UCL> 1, it is not certain, so may be classified as a possible overexposure. If the LCL > 1, it is with 95 percent confidence that an overexposure exists. 86 AFQTP 4B051-7                          Journeyman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling   TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS       STS Line Item 4.5.2.13:  Calculate upper and lower confidence limits 1.
