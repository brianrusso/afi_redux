Definition and Purpose.  An Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) refers to a legal instrument entered into under the authority of Title 10, US Code (USC), Subtitle A, Part IV, Chapter 138, Subchapter I, Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements, which authorizes the  acquisition  and  reciprocal  provision  of  logistics  support,  supplies,  or  services  (LSSS).    An ACSA is also  sometimes referred  to  as  a Logistics Support Agreement  (LSA), Mutual Support Agreements  (MSA),  or  Mutual  Logistics  Support  Agreement  (MLSA).    ACSAs  allow  for  the reimbursable  exchange  of  LSSS  between  the  Armed  Forces  and  military  forces  of  nations  or international organizations with which the US has a concluded ACSA.  They are used primarily during  combined  exercises,  training,  deployments,  or  unforeseen  circumstances  or  exigencies, including  wartime,  contingency  operations,  humanitarian  or  foreign  disaster  relief,  and  peace operations  conducted  under  Chapter  VI  or  VII  of  the  United  Nations  (UN)  Charter,  in  which there is a need to acquire and/or transfer LSSS. 1.1.1.  The  Secretary  of  Defense  (SecDef)  implements  ACSA  authorities  from  10  USC Section  2341  through  DoD  Directive  2010.9,  Acquisition  and  Cross-Servicing  Agreements.  The Under SecDef for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD AT&L)), IAW DoDD 2010.9,  paragraphs  5.1.2  and  5.1.3;  designates  countries  eligible  for  cross-servicing agreements, authorizes the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) to conclude ACSA agreements,  and  issues  implementing  ACSA  policy  and  program  management  guidance  to the  military  departments.    Respective  responsibilities  of  the  secretaries  of  the  military departments and the combatant commanders (CCDRs) are found in DoDD 2010.9.  The AF implements DoDD 2010.9 with AFPD 25-3. 1.1.1.1.  ACSA is primarily a Combatant Command (CCMD) program.  AF MAJCOMs, CMAJCOMs and NGB, or lower level  components, will execute ACSA programs IAW an assigned Geographic CCMD or Functional CCMD for AMC and AFSOC. 1.1.1.2.  AF CCMD execution: MAJCOM/C-MAJCOM/or NAF/C-NAF Air Combat Command (ACC)   1 AF/AFNORTH   9 AF/AFCENT   12 AF/AFSOUTH Air Education & Training Command (AETC)   2 AF   19 AF AF Global Strike Command (AFGSC)   8 AF   20 AF AF Materiel Command (AFMC)   CCMD US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) US Central Command (USCENTCOM) US Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) USNORTHCOM  USNORTHCOM USNORTHCOM CCMD 4 AFI25-301  3 JUNE 2016            MAJCOM/C-MAJCOM/or NAF/C-NAF AF Reserve Command (AFRC)   4 AF   10 AF   22 AF AF Space Command (AFSPC)   14 AF   21 AF   24 AF AF Special Operations Command (AFSOC)  US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) USNORTHCOM USNORTHCOM Air Mobility Command (AMC)   18 AF/AFTRANS Air National Guard Bureau (ANGB) Pacific Air Forces (PACAF)   5 AF   7 AF   11 AF US Air Forces Europe-Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA)   3 AF and USNORTHCOM US Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) and USNORTHCOM USNORTHCOM US Pacific Command (USPACOM) US European Command (USEUCOM),  US Africa Command (USAFRICOM) 1.1.1.3.  Units  operating  in  an  AOR  as  a  chopped,  transient,  or  deployed  force  should execute ACSA transactions IAW with the deployed installation’s guidance first, and if a program  management  is  not  available  locally,  reach-back  to  their  assigned  NAF  or MAJCOM  for  support.      For  example,  an  AF  unit  deployed  to  Al  Udeid  AB  should execute  ACSA  transactions  using  the  379  Air  Expeditionary  Wing  (AEW)  ACSA program (AFCENT-USCENTCOM). 1.1.2.  An ACSA is not the primary means for obtaining LSSS.  It does not replace national responsibilities for planning and acquiring logistics requirements.  The intent of an ACSA is to provide commanders  with a flexible  tool to  obtain  or provide LSSS when  mission  needs prevent self-support. 1.1.3.  There are other statutory authorities, programs and international agreements that allow US  Forces  to  provide  support  to  foreign  forces.    Determining  which  statutory  authority  is AFI25-301  3 JUNE 2016 5 appropriate  is  scenario  dependent.    Supporting  legal  offices  and  AF  Component  ACSA managers can provide guidance on alternatives. 1.2.  ACSA  Global  Automated  Tracking  and  Reporting  System  (AGATRS).  AGATRS  is DoD’s accountable property system of record (APSR) for the SecDef, Joint Staff (JS), CCMDs, and Service Components to manage and track all ACSA transactions.  This system also serves as the world-wide library for concluded ACSAs and Implementing Arrangements (IA).  AGATRS is an unclassified web-based system that can be accessed world-wide.  See Chairman of the Joint Chief  of  Staff  Instruction  (CJCSI)  2120.01D,  Acquisition  and  Cross-Servicing  Agreements, Enclosure A, paragraph 5.k for additional information on AGATRS. 1.2.1.  AGATRS will be used by all AF units, as directed by MAJCOM, Numbered Air Force (NAF),  or  CCMD  Service  Component;  to  create,  record,  track,  report  on,  and  otherwise manage ACSA transactions.  (T-0). 1.2.2.  Documentation  recorded  in  AGATRS  will  include  transactional  information  that refects  the  transfer,  purchase  and/or  sale  of  material  sufficient  to  provide  a  complete  audit trail, fully compliant with Undersecretary of Defense  (Comptroller)  Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Guidance, April 2015, and DoDI 5010.40,  Managers’ Internal Control  Program  Procedures,  30  May  2013.  (T-0).    See  DoD  Financial  Management Regulation (FMR) 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Reimbursable Operations Policy, Chapter 8 and paragraphs 2.4 and 4.1 of this instruction for additional guidance on ACSA documentation. 1.3.  Eligible  Foreign  Nations.  Only  foreign  militaries  and  international  organizations  with which  the  US  has  concluded  ACSAs  are  eligible  for  cross-servicing  (acquisition  and  sale  or transfer of LSSS) using ACSA authority.  Eligible countries and international organizations from which  the  US  may  acquire  LSSS  under  the  acquisition-only  authority  are  those  that  meet  the criteria in paragraph 4.2 of DoDD 2010.9. 1.3.1.  Negotiation  and  conclusion  of  ACSAs  must  be  accomplished  per  AFPD  51-7, International Law and DoDD 5530.3, International Agreements. 1.3.2.  A  list  of  current  ACSAs  and  IAs  can  be  downloaded  from  the  Joint  Staff  J-4 intellipedia  site  (https://intellipedia.intelink.gov/wiki/ACSA),  as  well  as  AGATRS database.    Only  trained  and  authorized  personnel  have  access  to  AGATRS;  contact  your MAJCOM/A4  ACSA  manager  if  you  require  access  to  AGATRS.    Additionally,  the  Joint Staff J-4 intellipedia site provides all information necessary to educate personnel and execute ACSA transactions in accordance with JS policy.  Contact  your MAJCOM ACSA manager for specific procedures or guidance prior to conducting ACSA exchanges. 1.4.  Reimbursement Methods.  ACSAs and IAs allow for reimbursement in one of three ways: 1.4.1.  Payment-in-Kind (PIK) including electronic funds transfer (EFT), cash or check. 1.4.2.  Replacement-in-Kind (RIK). 1.4.3.  Equal-Value-Exchange  (EVE).    Guidance  for  pricing  reimbursable  transactions  for ACSAs is found in DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 8. 1.4.4.  All ACSA transactions will be processed using AGATRS. 6 AFI25-301  3 JUNE 2016 1.4.5.  PIK  transactions  are  billed/paid  in  accordance  with  CJCSI  2120.01D,  DoD  FMR 7000.14R.    MAJCOM/FM  ACSA  POCs  will  oversee  and  provide  MAJCOM  ACSA managers with ACSA PIK billing and payment policies and procedures. 1.5.  Categories  of  Support.  CJCSI  2120.01D,  page  GL-4,  defines  LSSS  that  may  be exchanged  using  ACSA  authority  as:  food,  water,  billeting,  transportation  (including  airlift), petroleum,  oils,  lubricants,  clothing,  communications  services,  medical  services,  ammunition (with limitations), base operations support (and construction incident to base operations support), storage  services,  use  of  facilities,  training  services,  spare  parts  and  components,  repair  and maintenance services, calibration services, and air and sea-port services.  The term also includes temporary use (lease or loan) of general purpose vehicles and other items of non-lethal military equipment not designated as significant military equipment on the United States Munitions List (USML)  promulgated  pursuant  to  Title  22,  USC,  Part  1,  subchapter  M,  Part  121,  The  United States Munitions List. 1.5.1.  As  outlined  in  10  USC  §  2350,  base  operations  support  allowable  under  ACSA includes  minor  construction  under  10  USC  §  2854,  2805,  and  2803  incident  to  base operations  support.    Further  guidance  on  minor  construction  projects  is  found  in  AFI  32-1023, Designing and Constructing Military Construction Projects. 1.5.2.  For  guidance  on  control  and  transfer  of  USML  and  combat  configured  load  assets, refer  to  AFI  23-101,  Air  Force  Materiel  Management  and  AFI  21-201,  Conventional Munitions Management. 1.5.3.  ACSAs may not be used to transfer items that are subject to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 USC § 2011 et seq).   If it is unclear whether a contemplated category of LSSS is permissible, consult your higher headquarters ACSA manager and the servicing Staff Judge Advocate for specific guidance. 1.6.  Guidance  for  ACSA  Use.  Before  providing  any  LSSS,  including  repair  services, maintenance  services  or  spares  support  to  a  foreign  military  under  an  ACSA,  the  ACSA  POC must  ensure  release  of  the  requested  LSSS  is  authorized.    Release  of  classified  or  sensitive materiel  must  be  carefully  examined  and  specifically  approved  by  the  appropriate  Foreign Disclosure  release authority.  Transfer  of publications,  regulations, technical orders and  similar documents  is  not  authorized  under  this  program.    An  ACSA  does  not  bind  either  party  to providing  support.    Support  must  be  denied  if  requested  support  is  not  authorized,  negatively impacts  US  military  appropriations  or  current  operations,  and/or  requires  an  increase  in  US inventory levels for the sole purpose of supporting foreign LSSS requests. 1.6.1.  The  Defense  Logistics  Agency-Energy  (DLA-E)  oversees  and  executes  the  majority of  Petroleum,  Oils  and  Lubricants  (POL)  transfers  using  ACSA  IAs,  Fuel  Exchange Agreements,  Offset  Billing  Agreements,  or  Direct  Billing  Agreements  in  accordance  with DoD  4140.25-M,  Volume  II,  Chapter  17,  DoD  Management  of  Bulk  Petroleum  Products, Natural  Gas,  and  Coal,  and  in  accordance  with  AFI  23-201,  Fuels  Management.    AF organizations  requiring  fuel  support  and  related  services  from  foreign  governments  shall forward their requirements to DLA-E via the respective CCMD Joint Petroleum Office. 1.6.2.  In  accordance  with  AFI  10-1801,  Foreign  Government  Aircraft  Landings  at  USAF Installations, “routine airport services” are provided on a non-reimbursable basis for military and  state  aircraft  of  foreign  countries.    AFI  10-1801  identifies  standard  non-reimbursable AFI25-301  3 JUNE 2016 7 support, such as use of runways, ground services, baggage on/off loading, and other routine airport  services,  that  may  be  provided  to  all  foreign  militaries  transiting  US  installations, whether or not they are NATO members.  AFI 10-1801 is only applicable to transient forces and  does  not  apply  to  locations  having  a  permanent  or  semi-permanent  foreign  military mission/presence  or  planned  operational  missions,  either  transiting  or  operating  from  that location.  AFI  10-1801  does  not permit  the provision  of consumable  items (i.e., petroleum, oil, lubricants, repair parts, etc.) on a non-reimbursable basis. 1.6.3.  In  accordance  with  paragraph  4.7  of  DoDD  2010.9,  US  Transportation  Command (USTRANSCOM) is the approval authority for ACSA requests for airlift operated by AMC.  Applicable  combatant  command  ACSA  managers  are  the  approval  authorities  for  airlift requests using CCMD organic assets.  Airlift ACSA requests are processed from the foreign military  requestor  through  appropriate  command  levels  to  the  appropriate  CCMD  ACSA manager.    When  requesting  airlift  from  a  foreign  military,  the  MAJCOM  ACSA  manager will coordinate the request through the appropriate CCMD ACSA manager who may consult with USTRANSCOM as needed. 1.6.4.  When properly approved, and consistent with the law and DoDD 2010.9, vehicles and equipment end items may be provided as a loan/lease under the provisions of ACSA.  There are  circumstances  such  as  exercises,  contingencies,  and  transient  support  to  foreign  forces where it is appropriate to loan/lease vehicles or equipment end items.  AF Component ACSA managers should refer to CCMD directives, instructions, or guidance to ensure any loan/lease is in compliance with CCMD policy.  Functional area managers must confer with Financial Management (FM) personnel to determine fair lease rates.  Guidance for pricing for the use (lease)  of  equipment  provided  under  an  ACSA  is  found  at  paragraph  080601.B  of  Volume 11A, Chapter 8, of DoD FMR 7000.14-R. 1.6.5.  AF organizations may not negotiate the provision  of support inherently controlled or owned  by  another  AF  organization,  without  the  prior  approval  of  that  organization  and/or appropriate headquarters elements. 1.6.6.  LSSS acquired from the AF through an ACSA may not be transferred by the recipient country  or  organization  to  a  third  party  without  the  permission  of  the  US  government.  Requests for such transfers must be forwarded through the applicable CCMD to Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). 8 AFI25-301  3 JUNE 2016 Chapter 2 ACQUISITION AND CROSS-SERVICING AGREEMENT (ACSA) AUTHORITIES AND RELATED DOCUMENTS 2.1.  Acquisition  and  Cross-Servicing  Authorities.  ACSAs are authorized per Title 10 of the United States Code,  Chapter  138, Subchapter  I.  This chapter  of  law provides for two distinct ACSA authorities: Acquisition-Only Authority and Cross-Servicing Authority. 2.1.1.  Acquisition-Only Authority. In situations where no Cross-Servicing Agreement exists, acquisition-only authority may be implemented either through contract using the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), or through international agreements (acquisition-only agreements) that rely on the authority of 10 USC § 2341. 2.1.2.  Cross-Servicing  Authority.    10  USC  Section  2342  authorizes  the  establishment  of Cross-Servicing Agreements under which the US may transfer LSSS to the military services of a foreign country on a reciprocal/reimbursable basis. 2.2.  Acquisition  and  Cross-Servicing  Agreements  (ACSA).  The  SecDef  implements  ACSA authority  in  DoDD  2010.9.    ACSAs  are  normally  negotiated  by  the  applicable  geographic CCMD  with  OSD  approval.    IAW  AFPD  25-3,  authority  to  negotiate  and  conclude  cross-servicing  agreements  must  be  requested  from  the  Secretary  of  the  AF  on  a  case  by  case  basis.  Procedures used for negotiating and concluding implementing arrangements must be IAW AFPD 51-7  and  AFI  51-701,  Negotiating,  Concluding,  Reporting  and  Maintaining  International Agreements.    ACSAs  form  the  foundation  for  follow-on  Implementing  Arrangements  (IA),  if such arrangements are required. 2.3.  Implementing  Arrangements  (IA).  IAs  define  specific  roles  and  responsibilities  for executing LSSS transfers, specify additional terms and conditions, identify types of support and payment methods, and provide key points of contact for logistical and financial concerns. 2.3.1.  An IA is often negotiated at the same time as the ACSA and is normally incorporated into the ACSA.  It may also be a separate document, usually annexed and subordinate to the ACSA.    The  IA  is  normally  generic  in  scope  and  multi-service  applicable.    POCs  for  each signatory  are  listed,  allowing  direct  contact  between  POCs  in  initiating  and  conducting transactions.  Development, negotiation and conclusion of any IA require delegated authority and must be coordinated through the appropriate CCMD ACSA manager. 2.4.  Requests for Support.  Requests for support processed under the authority of an ACSA or an  ACSA  IA  are  treated  as  “orders”  however,  providing  support  is  not  mandatory  and  each request  must  be  evaluated  for  legal  sufficiency  and  operational  impacts.    All  approved  ACSA orders will be loaded into AGATRS, with proof of reimbursement support, to ensure AF has full auditability from the placement of an approved order to the payment for that order. 2.4.1.  IAW  AFPD  25-3  approved  transactions  (orders  accepted  and  filled)  will  be documented. 2.4.1.1.  Agreed  upon  forms  of  documentation  are  normally  identified  within  the applicable ACSA and/or IA.  The Form 1-3a, Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA)/Mutual Logistics Support (MLS) Order Form, produced in AGATRS is the DoD standard  ACSA  order/receipt/invoice  form  and  will  be  used  by  AF  forces  whenever AFI25-301  3 JUNE 2016 9 possible.  Attach any applicable forms or Implementing  Instructions (II) as necessary to the primary transaction form. 2.4.1.2.  If AGATRS is unavailable, or if use of the Form 1-3a is otherwise precluded, an alternate form of documentation is acceptable as long as it contains all minimum essential data elements and proper/authorized signatures from both parties to the transaction. 2.4.1.3.  Required  data  elements  are  listed  in  every  ACSA/IA.  See  CJCSI  2120.01D, Acquistion  and  Cross-Servicing  Agreements,  Enclosure  D,  Appendix  A  for  additional information regarding minimum essential data elements and a sample Form 1-3a. 2.4.2.  ACSA  managers  will  use  AGATRS  to  maintain  a  record  of  all  completed  ACSA transactions.  (T-0).    AGATRS  is  the  official  DoD  system  of  record  and  all  ACSA transactions  must  be  inputted,  along  with  electronic  copies  of  forms  and  supporting documents applicable to the transaction (i.e., ledgers, spreadsheets, forms, formulas, e-mails or  other  correspondence  used transaction,  establish  pricing,  verify quantity/quality  of  support,  or  provide  evidence  of  receipt  or  consumption).    Supporting documentation may include, but will not be limited to: justify to the 2.4.2.1.  Signed ACSA forms 2.4.2.2.  Records of meals consumed 2.4.2.3.  Personnel status report or billeting headcounts 2.4.2.4.  Fuels dispensation or receipt records 2.4.2.5.  Standard supply system issue/receipt/turn-in documents 2.4.2.6.  Civil engineer work orders 2.4.2.7.  Records of utilities provision or consumption 2.4.2.8.  Record  of  medical  visit;  provision  of  medical  support;  consumption  of  medical materiel 2.4.2.9.  Contracts or record of contracting action 2.4.2.10.  Shipping documents; bills of lading 2.4.2.11.  Invoice and payment documentation (bills, receipts, cash collection vouchers) 2.4.2.12.  Records of coordination or negotiation 2.5.  Implementing  Instructions  (II).  IIs  are  used,  as  necessary,  to  define  the  details  of  a complicated  transaction  or  to  identify  administrative  procedures.    IIs  may  be  written  as  an attachment to an ACSA order form or as a stand-alone enduring document that can be routinely applied  at  a  forward  operating  location  or  combined  exercise.    Contact  AF  Component  ACSA managers for examples and templates. 2.5.1.  Stand-alone  IIs  are  developed  and  published  by  AF  personnel,  units  or  agencies  and are  not  signed  by  foreign  force  representatives.    Such  IIs  are  not  considered  international agreements and therefore the requirements and restrictions of AFI 51-701 do not apply.  Care must  be  taken,  however,  to  ensure  the  IIs  are  fully  consistent  with,  and  do  not  exceed,  the scope of the ACSA or IA.  To that end, a review of stand-alone IIs by the local Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) office is recommended. 10 AFI25-301  3 JUNE 2016 2.5.2.  The  authority  to  write  IIs  rests  with  the  appropriate  ordering  authorities  listed  in  the ACSA  or  IA,  or  their  designated  POCs.    This  authority  may  be  further  delegated  to  levels appropriate to ensure transaction visibility and accountability. 2.5.3.  Foreign ACSA managers or POCs may have different procedures for establishing the terms of exchange when they are the transaction supplying agent.  The use of IIs should be promoted as the preferred method of detailing ACSA exchanges involving AF units. AFI25-301  3 JUNE 2016 11 Chapter 3 FUNCTIONAL AREA RESPONSIBILITIES AND AUTHORITIES 3.1.  Combatant  Commands  (CCMDs).  CCMDs  generally  serve  as  the  DoD  executive  agent for  ACSAs  concluded  with  countries  or  organizations  within  their  geographic  area  of responsibility  (AOR).    In  this  capacity  they  are  responsible  for  establishing  policies  and procedures governing the use of those ACSAs for which they are executive agent, and managing the overall ACSA program within the AOR. 3.1.1.  CCMD ACSA responsibilities are delineated in DoDD 2010.9 and CJCSI 2120.01D. 3.2.  AF  ACSA  Manager.  AF/A4L  is  the OPR for AF  ACSA  matters  and will appoint  an AF ACSA manager. 3.2.1.  The AF ACSA manager is delegated authority by AF/A4L to: 3.2.1.1.  Act  as  the  single  focal  point  for  this  AFI  and  resolve  disputes  regarding  its implementation. 3.2.1.2.  Represent AF at the CJCS/J4 annual ACSA worldwide workshop. 3.2.1.3.  Chair an AF ACSA working group, held in conjunction with the CJCS/J4 annual ACSA worldwide workshop. 3.2.1.4.  Convene and chair Headquarters Air Force (HAF) level ACSA working groups to resolve cross-functional issues (supply, maintenance, financial, legal, etc.) as required. 3.3.  MAJCOM,  C-MAJCOM,    or  NGB  ACSA  Manager.  The  MAJCOM/A4  Directors  are delegated  ACSA  authorities  and  will  appoint  an  ACSA  manager  from  the  logistics  plans functional area IAW CJCSI 2120.01D, Enclosure A, paragraph 9.  MAJCOM ACSA managers must be cognizant of their CCMD ACSA policies and procedures and should establish a working relationship with the CCMD ACSA manager, typically located in the logistics directorate (J4). 3.3.1.  The MAJCOM ACSA manager is delegated authority by their MAJCOM/A4 to: 3.3.1.1.  Execute  transactions  on  behalf  of  the  AF  in  accordance  with  DoD  and  CCMD guidance. 3.3.1.2.  Ensure compliance with applicable directives and instructions. 3.3.1.3.  Maintain ACSA transaction records in AGATRS. 3.3.1.4.  Delegate ACSA transaction authority, within the parameters of pertinent IAs, to subordinate units when appropriate. 3.3.1.5.  Provide MAJCOM guidance to the field. 3.3.1.6.

An  acquisition  agreement  is  an international agreement. Cross-Servicing  Agreement—A  legal  instrument  entered  into  under  the  authority  of 10 USC § 2342 that authorizes the reciprocal provision of logistic support, supplies, or services.  A Cross-Servicing Agreement is an international agreement. Implementing  Arrangements  (IA)—A  supplementary  arrangement  that  prescribes  details, terms,  and  conditions  to  implement  an  ACSA  in  more  defined  levels  of  activity  than  ACSAs themselves.    They  must  be  completely  consistent  with  associated  ACSAs  and  DoDD  2010.9.  Implementing  arrangements  that  do  not  involve  the  obligation  of  funds  may  extend  for  an indefinite period of time.  An implementing arrangement is an international agreement. Implementing Instructions (II)—IIs address the type of support exchanged, units involved, the duration required, any limitations involved, costs incurred, fund cite(s) to which payment will be transferred, billing cycles, and so on.  IIs are distributed to all organizations identified in the II, to  include  applicable  foreign  POCs.    Since  IIs  primarily  address  in-house  administrative procedures  and  responsibilities  for  handling  transactions,  they  are  not  international  agreements and are not signed by both national forces.
