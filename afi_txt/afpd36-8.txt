Employee Benefits and Entitlements and Work/Life Programs 1.1.  Overview.  The United States Air Force is committed to improving workforce efficiency while  promoting  quality  of  life  for  its  civilian  workforce.    Attracting  and  retaining  valued employees requires flexible and responsive programs to balance the need for uniformity with flexibility when appropriate.  It is Air Force policy to: 1.1.1.  Promote  the  use  of  flexible  work  arrangements,  to  include  compressed  work schedules,  flexible  work  schedules,  and  telework  for  eligible  positions  and  employees.  Consistent  with  workload  and  mission  requirements,  Installation  Commanders,  Tenant Commanders, and Heads of Activities should attempt to overcome artificial barriers and permit flexible work arrangements that allow employees to better balance their work and family  responsibilities  on  a  daily  basis.  Commanders  should  regularly  promote  flexible work  arrangements  throughout  their  organizations  for  eligible  employees  and  remind supervisors  to  inform  applicants  of  available  work/life  flexibilities  when  filling vacancies. Installation Commanders, Tenant Commanders and Heads of Activities should also  incorporate  plans  for  telework  arrangements  into  their  Continuity  of  Operations (COOP) plans. 1.1.2.  Value  the  health  and  fitness  of  all  personnel  and  empower  individuals  and organizations to actualize those values and achieve optimal health as a means to enhance mission readiness and unit performance.  As workload and resources allow, Commanders and  Heads  of  Activities  should  implement  programs  designed  to  promote  healthy lifestyles  and  disease  or  injury  prevention  to  include  authorizing  excused  absence  from duty  to  participate  in  physical  fitness  activities  and  providing  health  fairs/health-promotion opportunities to employees. 1.1.3.  Support  civilian  employees  by  appropriate  use  of  compensation  incentives,  e.g.,   performance  bonus,  foreign  language  proficiency  pay  and  various  premium  pays, consistent  with  mission  needs.  Commanders  and  Heads  of  Activities  should  ensure overtime  work  is  scheduled  and  approved  in  advance  and  occurs  only  as  necessary  to AFPD36-8  24 DECEMBER 2014   3  accomplish  an  essential  mission.  Installation  Commanders,  Tenant  Commanders,  and Heads  of  Activities  may  utilize  any  of  these  flexibilities/incentives  that  will  ensure  the accomplishment of the Air Force mission while enhancing the quality of life of civilian employees consistent with government-wide, DoD, and Air Force policies. 1.1.4.  Promote the safety and well-being of all employees and their families.  Installation Commanders, Tenant Commanders, and Heads of Activities should establish procedures within  their  organizations  to  account  for  the  status  and  whereabouts  of  individuals assigned  therein  in  the  event  of  disasters,  ensure  all  personnel  have  current  emergency contact  information  on  file  and  are  provided  the  necessary  information  and  guidance regarding when and how to check in. 1.1.5.  Ensure  Commanders  provide  for  and  make  appropriate  use  of  Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) for employees with substance abuse problems (or referral to community-base  assessment  and  treatment  services  if  EAP  is  unavailable  on  the installation), consistent with AFI 44-107, AF Civilian Drug Demand Reduction Program. The  Air  Force  also  recognizes  that  other  work  or  family  pressures  and  job  stress  can adversely  affect  employee  performance,  reliability,  or  personal  health  and,  therefore, encourages  Installation  Commanders  or  Heads  of  Activities  to  provide  EAPs,  or  like services, for personal counseling needs of their civilian workforce. 1.1.6.  Provide  retirement  planning  and  financial  literacy  education  information  to  the civilian  workforce  via  electronic  or  other  means  to  assist  employees  in  planning  their career-long  investment  and  retirement  strategies.    As  budget  and  mission  requirements allow, Installation Commanders, Tenant Commanders, and Heads of Activities may also provide lectures/seminars to employees covering work/life issues of retirement, benefits, and financial planning. 1.1.7.  Ensure  that  employees  are  provided  a  safe  and  healthful  work  environment  that complies with DoD safety and health policies. Provide prompt medical attention and full assistance in claiming just compensation for injuries or occupational illnesses incurred in the  performance  of  their  duties.    Installation  Commanders,  Tenant  Commanders,  and Heads of Activities will provide unemployment planning and benefits information to the civilian  workforce  via  electronic  or  other  means  to  assist  employees  in  planning  their short-term financial strategies following involuntary separation from employment. 1.1.8.  The  Air  Force  will  ensure  civilian  benefits,  entitlements,  and  work/life  programs are  administered  without  unlawful  discrimination  because  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, genetic information, or  prior  EEO  activity.    Applicable  policies  and  procedures  must  be  consistent  with government-wide, DoD and Air Force policies; formalized in writing; and communicated to employees. 2.
