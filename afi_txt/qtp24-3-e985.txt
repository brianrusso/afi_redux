Keep in gear for maximum control.  5.4.1.5.  Never operating with the parking brake engaged.  5.4.1.6.  Ensuring  adequate  ventilation  under  all  conditions.    Exhaust  fumes  can  cause severe injury or death to personnel.  5.4.1.7.  Keeping  personnel  at  a  minimum  of  50  ft.  away  from  the  vehicle  while  in operation.  5.4.1.8.  No riders, except during training (instructor must wear safety harness and secure it to the vehicle).  5.4.1.9.  Ensuring all controls are clean and fee of oil.  5.4.1.10.   Never leaving a running unit unattended.  5.4.1.11.   Never  using  steering  wheel  or  controls  as  hand  holds  for  mounting  and dismounting.  5.4.1.12.   Transmission may be up shifted.  Do not overrun the engine by downshifting.  Ensure the speed is not too great before attempting to downshift (5 miles per hour (mph)).  5.4.1.13.   Avoid idling engine for long periods.  5.4.1.14.   Never allowing others to work on or under suspended loads.  5.4.1.15.   Never exceeding load capacity.  5.4.1.16.   Being aware of power lines while traveling.  5.4.1.17.   Operator may refuse to lift or move any load that exceeds capacity, any unsafe load, or any load not designated to be lifted by this machine.  5.4.1.18.   Ensuring ground crews are qualified in all hand signals.  5.4.1.19.   Never attempting to follow more than one ground crew member.  CAUTION:  Ground crews will be used for all lifting, positioning, and for transportation of loads that restrict the operators’ vision.  5.4.1.20.   Do not lift container if all lift locks are not fully engaged and indicator lights do not show engaged.  5.4.1.21.   Be aware of steep inclines and declines.  5.4.1.22.   Ensure chocks are positioned, as required.  5.4.1.23.   Never stack containers during times of high winds (over 28 mph) or when the wind exceeds the operator’s skill level or comfort zone.  5.4.2.  Off-road  driving.    Drive  carefully  on  uneven,  wet  or  slippery  surfaces.    For  more information on off-road driving and safe vehicle operation guidance, refer to AFMAN 24-306.  5.4.3.  Cargo  loading  and  tie-down  procedures.    For  more  information  on  safely  loading, transporting and unloading cargo, refer to AFMAN 24-306 and the manufacturer’s operator’s manual for the specific vehicle type.  5.4.4.  Hazardous  cargo.    For  more  information  on  transporting  hazardous  cargo,  refer  to AFMAN 24-306 and the Hazardous Cargo Lesson Plan.  5.4.5.  Observe all flightline traffic rules.  5.4.6.  Foreign Object Damage (FOD).  Vehicle operators will remove FOD from tires during daily  vehicle  inspection.    Before  entering  the  airfield,  a  physical  check  for  loose/unsecured objects and an inspection of the tire treads for FOD will be accomplished, with the exception of emergency vehicles responding to actual situations.  5.4.6.1.  Any vehicle which has been driven on an unpaved surface will have a tire FOD inspection accomplished prior to re-entering the airfield area.  Vehicles that frequent the flight line will be equipped with a FOD picker and a covered FOD container.     5.4.6.2.  FOD picker will be etched with the vehicle number painted on red or orange (or have a red streamer attached). 5.4.6.3.  FOD picker will be annotated on vehicle inspection form. 5.4.6.4.  FOD  containers  will  be  identified  with  the  letters  "FOD"  and  will  be  emptied daily. 5.4.6.5.  FOD checks are performed to help eliminate aircraft damage.  5.4.7.  Spotter safety.  5.4.7.1.  Always use a spotter.  The operator should maintain visual contact with the spotter at all times.  If visual contact is lost, the operator must immediately stop the vehicle.  See AFMAN 24-306 for additional guidance on spotter safety and standard AF spotter hand signals.  5.5. Vehicle Operation.  5.5.1.  Control  familiarization.    To  ensure  quick  response  time  under  normal  or  emergency conditions, a thorough familiarization of controls, locations, and functions will be provided by the trainer.  Students will be given enough time to build familiarity in control location and use prior to operating the vehicle and being licensed on the vehicle.  5.5.2.  Engine starting.  Turn master switch to the ON position.  5.5.3.  Be sure all controls and gear levers are in neutral (vehicle is equipped with a neutral switch and will not start in gear).  5.5.4.  Engage parking brake.  5.5.5.  Turn ignition switch to start the vehicle.  5.5.6.  Idle engine –under 1000 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 5-10 minutes.  5.5.7.

The trainer examiner will be scoring on 100K reach stacker operations and also the general  safe  driving  practices.    The  examiner  will  give  directions  and  instructions  to  the trainee in sufficient time to execute a driving maneuver.  He/she will not be asked to drive in an unsafe manner.  A3.3.2.   The examiner will be making various marks on the performance test checklist.  This does not necessarily mean the trainee has done anything wrong.  It is in the best interest to concentrate  on  the  operation  of  the  100K  reach  stacker.    The  trainer  will  explain  the  test results at the conclusion of the performance test.  A3.3.3.   Tasks being graded are listed on the following page; the trainee will be required to successfully pass all items.  A3.3.4.   The instructor will stop the test at any time safe 100K reach stacker operations are not being followed or as deemed necessary for safety concerns.   Figure A3.1.

Seven-Step Inspection Process Step 1.  Vehicle Overview 2.  Check Engine Compartment o o      o o o o o Procedure  o Review the AF Form 1800. Ensure any discrepancy has been corrected. Vehicle Management annotated the discrepancy was completed. Approaching the vehicle. Damage or vehicle leaning to one side. Fresh leakage of fluids. Hazards around vehicle. Note:  Check that the parking brakes are on and/or wheels chocked.  The operator may have to raise the hood, tilt the cab (secure loose things so they don't fall and break something), or open the engine compartment door. Check the following: Engine oil level. Coolant level in radiator; condition of hoses. Power steering fluid level; hose condition (if so equipped). o  Windshield washer fluid level. o Battery fluid level, connections and tie-downs (battery may be located elsewhere). Automatic transmission fluid level (may require engine to be running). Check belts for tightness and excessive wear (alternator, water pump, air compressor)--learn how much "give" the belts should have when adjusted right.    3.  Start Engine and Inspect Inside the Cab o       o o o o o o o   Leaks in the engine compartment (fuel, coolant, oil, power steering fluid, hydraulic fluid, battery fluid). Cracked, worn electrical wiring insulation. Get in and start engine. Make sure parking brake is on. Put gearshift in neutral (or park if automatic).  Start engine; listen for unusual noises. If equipped, check the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) indicator lights.  Light on dash should come on and then turn-off.  If it stays on the ABS is not working properly. Note:  For trailers only, if the yellow light on the left rear of the trailer stays on, the ABS is not working properly. Look at the gauges. Oil pressure.  Should come up to normal within seconds after engine is started. Air pressure.  Pressure should build from 50 to 90 psi within 3 minutes. Build air pressure to governor cut-out (usually around 120 – 140 psi.  Know the vehicle’s requirements. Ammeter and/or voltmeter.  Should be in normal range(s). Coolant temperature.  Should begin gradual rise to normal operating range. Engine oil temperature.  Should begin gradual rise to normal operating range. Warning lights and buzzers.  Oil, coolant, charging circuit warning, and antilock brake system lights should go out right away. Check condition of controls.  Check all of the following for looseness, sticking, damage, or improper setting: Steering wheel. Clutch.               o  o       o   Accelerator (gas pedal). Brake controls.

Check for all required papers, trip manifests, permits, etc. Secure all loose articles in cab (they might interfere with operation of the controls or hit the operator in a crash). Start the engine. Test for hydraulic leaks. If the vehicle has hydraulic brakes, pump the brake pedal three times. Then apply firm pressure to the pedal and hold for five seconds. The pedal should not move.  If it does, there may be a leak or other problem. Brake system. Test parking brake. Fasten safety belt. Set parking brake (power unit only).  Place vehicle into a low gear. Gently pull forward against parking brake to make sure the parking brake holds. If it doesn't hold vehicle, it is faulty; get it fixed. Test service brake stopping action. Go about 5 miles per hour. o o o o  o o o o o   Push brake pedal firmly. "Pulling" to one side or the other can mean brake trouble.
