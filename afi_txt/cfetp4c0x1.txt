The  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)  is  the  primary  document  used  to identify  life-cycle  education  and  training  requirements.  It  serves  as  a  road  map  for  career progression and outlines requirements that must be satisfied at appropriate points throughout the career path.  The CFETP also specifies the mandatory task qualification requirements for award and maintenance of an Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). 2.  The CFETP consists of two parts. Supervisors will use both parts to plan, manage, and control training within the specialty. 2.1.  Part I provides Air Force Specialty (AFS) information in five sections:  Section A explains how  everyone  will  use  the  plan.  Section  B  explains  AFS  progression  and  information  and  it provides  AFS  duties  and  job  progression  information  within  five  paragraphs:  paragraph  1 identifies Specialty Description information; paragraph 2 identifies Skill and Career Progression information;  paragraph  3  identifies  Training  Decisions;  paragraph  4  identifies  Community College  of  the  Air  Force  (CCAF)  requirements;  and  paragraph  5  explains  career  field  path requirements.  Section  C  associates  each  level  with  specialty  qualifications  (knowledge, education,  experience,  training,  and  other).    Section  D  indicates  resource  constraints.    Some examples  are  funds,  manpower,  equipment  and  facilities.    Section  E  is  not  used.    There  is currently no transition training requirement.  2.2.  Part II is subdivided into five sections:  Section A identifies the specialty training standard (STS)  and  includes:  core  tasks,  wartime  and  technical  references  to  support  training,  Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level formal or career development course (CDC) requirements; and the proficiency levels.  Section B, contains the Course Objective List (COL) and training standards for supervisors to use as an evaluation tool for course graduates.  Section C contains support materials; this course utilizes qualification training  packages  (QTPs)  to  support  both  upgrade  training  (UGT)  and  qualification  training. Section D contains the training course index; lists include all mandatory Air Force in-residence, field, Air Force Institute of Advanced Distributed Learning (AFIADL), and exportable courses available to support this AFSC.  Section E is not used.  There are currently no MAJCOM unique requirements. 2.2.1.

They provide services in the following 12 core functions outlined by the International Certification  &  Reciprocity  Consortium  (IC&RC):  screening,  intake,  orientation,  assessment, treatment  planning,  counseling,  case  management,  crisis  intervention,  education,  referral,  report and record keeping, and consultation.  Note:  In the ADAPT program, they were formerly referred to as Alcohol Drug Counselors or ADCs.  8.6.1.    The  AFSACCB  issues  the  certification  and  has  the  authority  to  revoke  certification  for cause.  The education  and certification requirements include a minimum of 270 hours of formal classroom  education,  for  enlisted  applicants, this requirement.  a  cumulative  6,000  work-related  hours  within  the  12  core  functions  of  substance abuse counseling, 300 of which must be accomplished within the ADAPT Program, under direct supervision  of  another  fully  qualified  CADC  or  privileged  Mental  Health  Provider,  (MHP),  and  have a signed agreement to practice under strict AF ethical guidelines.  Ethical guidelines are state or  board  specific.    Applicants  must  demonstrate  competence  by  submission  of  a  written  case presentation  of  Global  Criteria  of  the  12  Core  Functions.    Applicants  must  also  demonstrate  a training  graduation  satisfies technical  14 working knowledge of substance abuse theories, procedures, and concepts by passing the IC&RC written examination administered by the AF.  8.6.2.

Counselors  are  to  complete  60  contact  hours  of  professional  education  within  the  12  Core Functions,  (three  of  those  hours  must  include  ADC  Code  of  Ethics  trainings).  Hours  for recertification can be derived from distance learning, CBT, on-line classes and or formal education.  NOTE: 4C0X1 personnel completing special duty assignments outside Career Air Force Specialty Code (to include Military Training Leader, Military Training Instructor, EPME, etc.) are required to maintain their certification while performing those duties.  All continuing education for these individuals will be accrued at member/unit’s expense  8.6.3.    Expiration  of  Certification.    Individuals  who  allow  their  CADC  certification  to  expire  are  not permitted  to  independently  perform  their  duties  as  a  substance  abuse  counselor.    The  technician  will conduct all 12 core functions only when supervised by an CADC or privileged MHP, and must have direct supervision during the entire patient contact, IAW AFI 44-121, Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program.  If a member fails to certify within 6 months of expiration, AFSC will be withdrawn, IAW AFI-36-2201, Classifying Military Personnel (Officers and Enlisted).  9.    Training  Decisions.    The  CFETP  uses  a  building  block  approach  (simple  to  complex)  to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Mental Health Service career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy  must  be  apparent  and  affordable  to  reduce  duplication  of  training  and  eliminate  a disjointed approach to training.  The following decisions were made at the career field Specialty Training Team Requirements meeting held at JBSA-Fort Sam Houston on January 2013 and the U&TW held by teleconference on 14 February 2014.  9.1. Initial Skills Training. The initial skill course was reviewed for content. Additions, deletions, and modifications were made to the course.  Additional contingency training was also identified.  9.2.  Five-Level Upgrade Training Requirements.  Existing CDCs were reviewed and updated to ensure only current material remained and new technology information was added.  Completion of the CDC is mandatory for upgrade to the 5-skill level.  9.3.    Seven-Level  Upgrade  Training  Requirements.    Seven-level  training  requirements  were reviewed and updated.  Completion of the CDC is mandatory for upgrade to the 7-skill level. 9.4.  Proficiency Training.  Any additional knowledge and skill requirements that were not taught through  initial  skills  or  upgrade  training  are  assigned  as  continuation  training.  Purpose  of continuation training is to provide training exceeding minimum upgrade training requirements with emphasis on present and future duty positions.  MAJCOMs must develop a continuation-training program  that  ensures  personnel  in  the  Mental  Health  Service  career  field  receive  the  necessary training at the appropriate point in their careers.  The training program will identify both mandatory and optional training requirements. 9.5.  Readiness Skills Verification (RSV) Training Requirements.  Training is conducted through web-based courseware on specific tasks listed in the STS.  Training tasks, which are identified in  15 the  RSV  database,  are  the  catalyst  for  training  program  development  (database  located  at https://kx2.afms.mil.    Airman  Basic  thru  Chief  Master  Sergeant  will  document  training  on  AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, available in RSV training database and document completion in the AFTR. 9.6.  Training for Unit Type Code (UTC) Requirements. All 4C0X1s assigned to deployable UTCs or deployable positions will complete UTC-specific training, field training, and other requirements as  directed  in  AFI  41-106,  Medical  Readiness  Planning  and  Training.  Training  for  these  tasks normally will be conducted via medical unit readiness training, field training, readiness exercises, or annual ancillary unit training. 9.7.  Other Training.  Active duty units, as well as those in the ARC, will establish appropriate 4C0 training to meet unit-specific disaster response training. 10.   Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).    CCAF is one of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions; however, it is the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military enlisted personnel. The college is regionally accredited through Air University by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award AAS degrees designed  for  specific  AF  occupational  specialties  and  is  the  largest  multi-campus  community college in the world.

There  are  five  sections  to  Part  II:  STS,  COL,  OJT  Support  Material,  Training  Course  Index,  and  MAJCOM-unique requirements. Section A – Specialty Training Standard 1.  Implementation.  This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes beginning 14 September 2015.  The 5-level CDCs will be available on/or about 1 December 2015 and the 7-level CDCs will be available on/or about 1 March 2016. 2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS: 2.1.  Lists  in  column  1  (Task,  Knowledge,  and  Technical  Reference)  the  most  common  tasks, knowledge and technical references necessary for Airman to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies, by “5” or “7” skill level, specialty-wide training requirements.  2.2.  Provides  certification  for  OJT.  Column  3  is  used  to  record  completion  of  tasks  and knowledge  training  requirements.    Use  automated  training  management  systems  to  document technician  qualifications,  if  available.    Task  certification  must  show  a  certification/completion date.  (As  a  minimum,  use  the  following  column  designators:    Training  Complete,  Certifier Initials). 2.3. Shows formal training and correspondence course and QTP requirements. Column 4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task/knowledge  and  career  knowledge  provided  by the  correspondence  course.  See  CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the UTM for current CDC listings. For a list of QTP volume numbers and titles, refer to Part II Section C. 2.4.  Qualitative  Requirements  identified  on  page  33  contains  the  proficiency  code  key  used  to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses. 2.5. The Part II STS listing is used to document task when placed in the ETR. Refer to AFI 36-2201 for further guidance on documentation, transcribing, decertification and recertification. 2.6.  STS.    Tasks  (Part  –  2)  are  trained  and  qualified  to  the  go/no-go  level.    “Go”  means  the individual  can  perform  the  task  without  assistance  and  meets  local  demands  for  accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures.  “No-go” means the individual cannot perform the task without  assistance  and  meets  local  demands  for  accuracy,  timeliness,  and  correct  use  of procedures  30 2.7. Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog (EPRRC). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKT) is developed at the USAF Airman Advancement Division by Senior NCO’s with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the EPRRC.  WAPS is not applicable to the ARC or the ANG. 3.  Recommendations. 3.1.

Section E - MAJCOM Unique Requirements  There are currently no MAJCOM-unique requirements.  Section F - Documentation of Training Part 1: Air Force Training Record (AFTR) 1.  AFTR  Purpose.    Is  an  enterprise-wide  custom  training  management  system  designed  to replace  the  paper-based  training  records  (previously  called  the  Enlisted  Training  and Competency Folder).  It has been mandated for use by all enlisted career fields within the Air Force Medical Service to document all training actions and competency-related issues. 2.  AFTR components managed by the supervisor are: 2.1. Master Task List (MTL).  The MTL is a comprehensive list containing 100% of all tasks performed within a work center.  The MTL consists of the current STS, AF Form 623 Parts II and  III,  AF  Forms  797,  Job  Qualifications  Standard  Continuation/Command  JQS,  and  1098 tasks, and tasks required to meet deployment and/or UTC requirements. 2.2. Master Training Plan (MTP).  The MTP employs a strategy for ensuring the completion of all work center job requirements by using an MTL and serves as a guide for supervisors, trainers, and certifiers to ensure that personnel are trained in an effective and efficient manner to meet training and mission requirements.  The MTP will include when tasks on the MTL should be trained  (priority/milestones),  how  they  will  be  trained  (resources/method),  and  approximately how long it should take to train on individual tasks or set of tasks.  Refer to AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program for guidance in developing the MTP. 2.3. Duty Task List (DTL).  The DTL is a list of all tasks required for a given duty position.  The  supervisor creates the DTL by selecting tasks from the MTL. 2.4. Individual Training Record (ITR).  All training is documented in the ITR by way of AFTR. This is the electronic version of the former Enlisted Training and Competency Folder.  The ITR  56 is made up of the AF Form 623 Parts I, II and III; AF Forms 623a, 797, 803 and 1098; and the JQS.  This  record  is  automatically  populated  based  upon  the  duty  position  the  individual  is assigned  to.  All  enlisted  personnel  (CMSgt  and  below)  with  a  medical  AFSC  will  have  an active ITR within AFTR.  Refer to AFI 36-2201 for guidance in documenting training on the various forms contained within the ITR. 2.5.  Qualification Training Packages (QTPs) were developed to enhance and standardize OJT for the 4C0X1 career field. 2.5.1    Required  for  all  tasks  identified  in  the  CFETP  that  requires  completion  of  a  QTP before upgrade. 2.5.2.  Required for all tasks not listed in the CFETP and/or identified by the duty section or facility  as  a  high  risk  procedure  or  task.    Tasks  included  in  the  CFETP  have  already  been reviewed.  Those identified as high risk usually have a QTP.  Other tasks in the CFETP do not require  QTPs.    NOTE:    Initial  POC  for  QTP  development  is  the  4C0X1  AFCFM.    The AFCFM may delegate the development of the QTPs to the MFM level 3.  AFTR  provides  the  capability  to  upload  training-related  documents  into  an  ITR.  The following documents (as applicable) will be uploaded into every 4C0X1 ITR: 3.1.  Current Basic Life Support Card. 3.2.  AF Form 2096, Classification On-The-Job Training Action. 3.3.  AETC Form 156, Student Training Report (Remove IAW AFI 36-2201). 3.4. CDC Enrollment Cards AETC Form 156, Student Training Report (Remove IAW AFI 36-2201). 3.5.  AF Form 34, Field Score Sheet (Remove IAW AFI 36-2201). 3.6.  Course Examination Scorecard (Remove IAW AFI 36-2201). 4.  Guidance for AFMS-required ITR documentation also includes (but is not limited to): AFI 41-106,  Medical  Readiness  Program  Management,  AFI  44-102,  Medical  Care  Management; AFI 44-110, Medical Quality Operations; and AFI 46-101, Nursing Services and Operations Part 2: Work Center Training Binder 5.  Initial  (work  center  orientation/supervisor  initial  evaluation)  and  ongoing  (competency verification) training is vital to the successful mission of any organization.  To ensure all initial and on-going work center training meets required standards, each work center will maintain a training binder (electronic or hard copy).  This training binder will be utilized by supervisors and trainers and will be set up in the following order:   57 5.1.  Work center description.  This includes daily work center mission, responsibilities, and any age-range of patients cared for in this work center. 5.2.    Work  center  training  monitor  appointment  letter  identifying  primary,  alternate,  and  their roles and responsibilities. 5.3.  Roster identifying work center trainer(s)/certifier(s). 5.4.  Job description/performance standards for each work center duty position. 5.5.    Current  CFETP  and  associated  change(s)  as  found  on  AF  E-Publishing  for  each  AFSC assigned to the work center.  Note:  It may be helpful to create/maintain a training binder for each AFSC. 5.6.  Copy of the MTP, as found in AFTR, for each duty position.  This will include the specialty training standard, 797s, 1098s, 623 II, and 623 III. 5.7.  Copies of all QTPs and/or ISD checklist(s) used during orientation and/or location(s) of any training plans/evaluation tools used to validate trainee qualifications. 5.8.  Work center orientation checklist. In addition to minimum requirements stated in AFI 36-2201, include timelines (milestones) for each task identified. 5.9.  AF  Form  623a  sample  entry  of  supervisor  initial  evaluation  of  trainee  qualifications. Minimum information required in statement can be found in AFI 36-2201.  This evaluation must also include full review of the MTP for trainee’s duty position, revalidation of qualification(s) and timelines (milestones) for items that require further validation and/or training. 5.10.  AF Form 623a sample entry of annual job description/performance standards review.  58
