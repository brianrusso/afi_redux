RELEASABILITY:  There are no releasability restrictions on this publication. Air Force Maintenance Badge Heraldry  The design of the falcon is a replica of the maintenance falcon located in the National Cathedral at Washington DC.  The falcon symbolizes the airborne strength by the Air Force and made possible by the maintenance of aircraft, munitions, and communications-electronics equipment.  In its talons, the falcon is holding a bomb and a generic 21st century aircraft.  They are crossed to show the interrelationship of the career fields.  The three levels of the award are signified by the addition of a star centered above the falcon for the senior level and the star surrounded by an olive wreath for the master level.                  The aircraft, streamlined to depict a 21st century aircraft, is symbolic of all aircraft maintained by the personnel who will wear the badge into the 21st century.  The aircraft has three leading edges, which represent the three enlisted maintenance specialties:  aircraft, munitions, and communications-electronics.  The personnel, like the leading edges of the aircraft, work together to support the flying mission.  The bomb, streamlined to depict a modern munition, symbolizes the primary mission of the Air Force maintainer to make sure they put the bombs on target.  The field is without obstruction and depicts a free sky and the olive wreath surrounding the badge, symbolizes the peace, which we defend through professional maintenance.  1  CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE OFFICER AFSC 21AX  TABLE OF CONTENTS     PART I PREFACE  Abbreviations/Terms Explained Section A, General Information Purpose of the CFETP CFETP Uses Coordination and Approval     Section B, Career Field Description, Training and Progression The Aircraft Maintenance Officer Career Field The Maintenance Officer Career Progression Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) Training Decisions Career Path/Training Flow  Section C, Proficiency Training Requirements Purpose 21A1 and 21A3 Specialty Qualifications  Section D, Resource Constraints  PART II Section A, Course Training Standards Task, Knowledge, and Proficiency Level requirements  Section B, Training Course Index Purpose AFSC Awarding Courses Non-AFSC Awarding Courses Aircraft Maintenance Supplementary Courses Field Training Detachment Courses (FTD) Exportable Courses Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) Follow-on MAJCOM/Unit Courses Department of Defense Courses  Section C, Support Material Follow-on Unit Training 21A Maintenance Officer Training Task List 21A3 certification requirements Senior certification requirements Master certification requirements  2 4  6  10     12      17    18   18   18           22      TABLE OF CONTENTS CONTINUED  Table 1.

In turn, this will require new knowledge, skills, and abilities in our officer, enlisted, and civilian workforce that align to the way we must operate in the future.  These changes must be identified and implemented across the near, mid, and long-term planning time frames. Vision:  We must be able to deliberately, repeatedly, and affordably deliver high quality, integrated, agile Total Force logisticians, across all planning time horizons, with the right competencies, at the right place, at the right time to provide agile logistics support of Global Vigilance – Global Reach – Global Power.”  Air Force Logistics Human Capital Strategy, 2016 1.  Aircraft Maintenance Officers.  A highly trained, motivated officer corps is a key resource for the Air Force to meet the challenges of the future.  The Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept is dependent on logistics in general and aircraft maintenance in particular for mission success.  Because of this dependency, it is essential the Air Force have a fully trained and qualified Aircraft Maintenance Officer corps.  The Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) for Aircraft Maintenance Officers provides the framework and  guidance  necessary  for planning, developing, managing, and conducting a career field training program.  The plan documents a “training roadmap” for the career field.  This roadmap identifies mandatory qualification and training certification requirements officers must receive during their time in aircraft maintenance.  This plan applies to members of the Air Reserve Component (ARC); however, specific timeline requirements for certification may be extended to accommodate the unique differences in time availability of ARC members.  1.1. This CFETP is a comprehensive core education and training document, which identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the Aircraft Maintenance Officer Specialty.  The CFETP provides a clear career path to success and instills rigor in all aspects of career field training.  2.  The CFETP.  The CFETP consists of two parts that are used to plan, manage, and control training within the 21AX career field.  2.1. Part I is in four sections and provides information necessary for overall management of training in the career field.  Section A explains how to use the plan; Section B identifies career progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and a career field flowchart; Section C associates each skill level with qualifications (knowledge, training, education, experience, etc.); Section D indicates resource constraints in formal/unit training, i.e., funds, manpower, equipment, facilities.  2.2. Part II includes four sections.  Section A identifies the Course Training Standards (CTS) which includes duties and tasks to support Air Education & Training Command (AETC) and unit training requirements; Section B lists all mandatory Air Force (AF) in-residence, field, HQ AU/A4L, and exportable courses used to support training; Section C identifies available support materials; Section D is used to identify MAJCOM-unique training requirements.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  3.  Using the CFETP.  The following individuals must utilize this CFETP to ensure Aircraft Maintenance Officers receive training and skill-enhancing experience at appropriate stages in their development.  Additionally, the following individuals must comply with but are not limited to the  4  following duties and responsibilities:  3.1. Individual:  Individual will complete all CFETP core competency requirements within 24 months of being assigned to a 21A position to achieve the 21A3 certification.   3.2. Unit Training Manager:  Responsibilities are outlined in AFI 36-2201.  Responsibilities include loading member’s CFETP into electronic training records, Training Business Area (TBA), and assisting the supervisor and commander with tracking/managing.  Grant supervisors and commanders access to member’s electronic training record. 3.3. Supervisor/Operations Officer:  Supervisors and operations officers will ensure officers in training understand fundamentals of each CFETP task, manage and control officer progression through career field, and document training in CFETP or electronic equivalent, except in the case of performance-based tasks where it may be signed off by a trainer or instructor.  Determine work centers an officer will visit, identify local aircraft and equipment training tasks, and review training progress with trainees on a monthly basis for basic certification award, (quarterly for all others), and document review.  Verify pre-task/task/post-task actions are included for follow-on training, identify tasks in addition to core tasks, and certify completion of training.  3.4. Squadron Commander:  Squadron commanders, or equivalent, are responsible for ensuring their assigned officers meet the requirements of the CFETP.  Squadron commander (or next higher authority) will certify the officer’s progression by signing the AF Form 2096, document task completion in TBA and award the basic and senior certifications.    3.5. Group Commander:  Group commanders will monitor the effectiveness of maintenance training; notify MAJCOMs of formal training shortfalls to ensure timely correction and redirection of formal training emphasis and ensures the best possible training environment for maintenance officers.  Group Commander certifies officer progression by signing the AF Form 2096 and awards the master certification.   5  ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED  AAMOC.

Purpose of the CFETP.  This CFETP contains and provides information for career field functional managers, commanders, supervisors, trainers, and the technical training centers to plan, develop, manage and conduct a robust career field training program.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade and qualification requirements, as well as advanced and continuation training opportunities.  The CFETP has several purposes.  1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, develop, manage, and conduct a career field training program.  Also, it is used to ensure established training is provided at the appropriate point in an officer’s career.  1.2. Identifies requirements for each skill level and recommends training for each phase of an officer’s career.  1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and provides the training medium.  1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact implementation of the desired career field training program.  2.  CFETP uses.  MFM and supervisors at all levels will use this plan to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive training program is instituted for each officer.  2.1. AETC develops/revises formal resident and exportable training based on user requirements documented in this CFETP.  AETC is responsible for developing procurement and acquisition strategies to obtain the resources required to provide training identified in the CFETP.  The AETC Course Training Manager (AETC CTM) and the AFCFM are the custodians of this CFETP and ensures HQ AFPC/DPPAT receives approved revisions for publication.  The AETC CTM is responsible for notifying HQ AETC to index the CFETP in E-pubs website.  2.2. The AFCFM will schedule and chair a Utilization and Training Workshop at a minimum every three years to address the training needs of the career field.  2.3. The MAJCOM functional manager will ensure training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial skills and upgrade requirements.  Identified requirements can be satisfied by AETC and unit resident training, or exportable courseware/courses.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate available training.  2.4. The CFETP or electronic equivalent is the training plan used by the 21A officer to determine training requirements and understand the career field paths and opportunities available.  Each 21A officer will complete the mandatory follow-on training requirements specified in this plan and as specified by the unit commander and document it in TBA.  2.5. Cross-flow officers will maintain a 21A CFETP while in the 21A cross flow and accomplish all core tasks identified in this CFETP, to include all locally identified mandatory items.  Recommend officers returning to other career fields continue to maintain this record for future requirements.    10  3.  Coordination and Approval.  The CFETP is approved and maintained by the AFCFM IAW AFI36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  Forward recommended changes to the AFCFM, HQ USAF/A4LM  4.  Use of TBA is mandatory for all active, guard, and reserve personnel to document CFETP requirements.  21A MFMs can assist if unable to comply with this mandate. 11  PART I  SECTION B - CAREER FIELD DESCRIPTION, TRAINING AND PROGRESSION  1.

IAW AFOCD, the following are mandatory for 21A3 certification:  completion of a formal AETC entry-level training course; minimum of 24 months assigned to a 21A position (Group Commanders may extend this requirement) and completion of the education and training requirements specified in the Aircraft Maintenance Officer Training Task List. Note: the occupational badge will be awarded upon completion of IST, unless previously awarded.  2.1.2. Senior Certification.  Representative grades are normally O-3 through O-4.  An officer will be eligible for the Senior Certification at the seven-year point in specialty (time spent outside of career field in positions not coded as 21AX does not count toward award of senior certification unless waivered by the group commander or equivalent), provided he/she has completed the education and training requirements specified in the Aircraft Maintenance Officer Training Task List.  2.1.3. Master Certification.  Representative grades are normally O-4 and higher.  An officer will be eligible for the Master certification at the 15-year point in the specialty (time spent outside of career field in positions not coded as 21AX does not count toward award of master certification unless waivered by the group commander or equivalent), provided he/she has completed the requirements specified in the Aircraft Maintenance Officer Training Task List.    13   Table 1.  Maintenance Officer Progression   2.2. Career Progression  2.2.1. Entry Level.  IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, initial skills training (IST) must be completed within six months of entering active duty unless restricted by lack of security clearance or other extenuating circumstances.  Upon successful completion of the 21A AETC IST Aircraft Maintenance Officer Course, graduates will receive entry level 21A1 AFSC.  Initial assignments provide opportunities to establish and build depth of knowledge and technical expertise within the aircraft maintenance career field.  Group Commanders will expose new officers to the entire mission of the unit.    2.2.1.1. Positions include, but are not limited to those listed in Table 3.  2.2.1.2. Entry Level officers should understand all requirements within the CFETP.  2.2.2. Intermediate Level.  Company grade officers should begin to broaden their breadth of knowledge, experience and expertise by pursuing DA and DE opportunities.  To develop a firm foundation in the maintenance career field, at least two of the first three assignments should be in a 21A position.  Back-to-back career broadening assignments are strongly discouraged.  Captains are required to attend the AETC MOIC or ASPC at AMMOS.  2.2.2.1. Positions include, but are not limited to those listed in Table 3.  2.2.3. Staff and Senior Level.  During this time, Field Grade Officers should pursue those opportunities that make them viable for squadron command and subsequent selection for group command or a key senior maintenance officer position in the Joint or greater logistics enterprise.  Field grade officers are expected to pursue DE opportunities commensurate with their rank.  2.2.3.1. Positions include, but are not limited to, those listed in Table 3.  2.3. Grandfathering CFETP Requirements.  In 2002, the decision was made that officers already holding the 21A core AFSC would not be required to complete certain CFETP training requirements.   14  Table 2, below, indicates by TAFCSD which tasks were grandfathered for those officers.  All officers accessed/cross-flowed/cross-trained to the career field after 2002 are required to meet all requirements set forth in the CFETP to earn officer certifications.    Table 2.  Grandfather Plan TAFCSD/TFCSD CFETP Certification Requirements 21A3 Senior Master 1 Jan 02 through current All All 1 Jan 97 through 31 Dec 01* Grandfathered MOIC or ASPC & 7 yrs in AFSC All All All Grandfathered 31 Dec 96 and prior Grandfathered * MOIC waiver requests need to be submitted through AF/A4LM.  2.3.1. Prior-Enlisted Maintenance Officers.  IAW AFI 36-2903, Dress and Appearance, prior-enlisted officers who held senior/master maintenance badges may continue to wear awarded badges.  However, these officers are required to meet all CFETP training requirements for maintenance officer career progression.  Time served in any prior enlisted maintenance AFSC counts toward the officer’s maintenance badge level (e.g., a First Lieutenant with four years in an enlisted maintenance AFSC and three years as a 21xx may wear the senior maintenance badge).  3.  Career Path/Training Flow.  Experience and knowledge in this Air Force specialty will help an officer plan and achieve their Air Force career goals as an Aircraft Maintenance Officer.  There are certain jobs or experiences in this discipline that will assist them in meeting individual goals.  Reference Table 3.  3.1. When initially assigned to aircraft maintenance, officers are expected to build depth through technical experience within the aircraft maintenance arena.  Unit-level Maintenance Officers are initially assigned to mission generation network, repair network, or Maintenance Group Staff.  3.2. After initial assignment there are various paths available to reach senior-level maintenance positions.  It is important to gain experience in both mission generation and repair network aspects of the maintenance career field.  Several permanent change of station (PCS) moves are normally required for an officer to experience these aspects to sufficient depth.  Career-broadening opportunities within complementary skill areas will provide additional breadth.              15   Table 3.  Aircraft Maintenance Officer Career Progression      4.  U&TW Training Decisions:  After reviewing the Occupational Analysis Report (OAR) data, formal training data, course training standards, and available formal/informal courses, the following decisions were made:   4.1. Updated the AFOCD and corresponding CFETP language.  4.2. Replaced Proficiency Codes with Behavioral statements.   4.3. The Training Task List (TTL) for 21A3 was substantially revised.    4.4.  The  Maintenance  Officer  Career  Progression  (Table  3)  was  updated  to  reflect  key  jobs  and developmental opportunities.   4.5. Clarified timing of initial certification requirements. 16  PART I  SECTION C - PROFICIENCY TRAINING REQUIREMENTS  1.  Purpose.  The proficiency training requirements in the 21AX career field are defined in terms of task and knowledge requirements for each skill level in the Aircraft Maintenance Officer Specialty.
