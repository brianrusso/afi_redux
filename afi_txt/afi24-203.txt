AF shippers will  use DTR, Parts  II,  III, V, and VI  as the primary  authority to  direct organization’s  shipping  activities  IAW  DoDI  4500.57,  Transportation  and  Traffic Management. (T-0). 2.1.2.  CMOS  use  is  mandatory  for  all  AF  deployment  and  distribution  cargo  movement functions. (T-1). 2.1.3.  Only  official  government  assets  may  be  processed  via  CMOS  at  the  Air  Force LRS/APS. 2.1.4.  If  CMOS  is  inoperable,  see  paragraph  6.2.1  and  the  CMOS  Emergency  Manual Shipping Procedures folder located at the CMOS website. 2.2.  Processing  Materiel  for  Shipment.  The  installation  LRS/APS  processes  two  types  of shipments;  Military  Standard  Requisitioning  and  Issue  Procedures  (MILSTRIP)  and  non-MILSTRIP. 2.2.1.  MILSTRIP shipments are processed on a DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/ Receipt Document. 2.2.1.1.  Piece count is not required unless the materiel is 999/NMCS/MICAP, classified and protected, or it is obvious the count differs from source document. 2.2.1.2.  OC  in-checkers  may  accept  materiel  for  base  originating  shipments  as documented.  However, in-checker retains the authority to inspect all shipments for safety, unauthorized  items,  characteristics/serviceability,  and  to  validate  serial  numbers  when accessible or visible. 2.2.1.3.  Acknowledge receipt of government materiel by in-checking cargo within CMOS. 2.2.2.  Non-MILSTRIP  shipments  are  processed  on  a  DD  Form  1149,  Requisition  and Invoice/Shipping Document, and are not processed through or accounted for in the base level retail supply system. 2.2.3.  Shippers must use the DD Form 1149 application within the LTS website. (T-1). 2.2.3.1.  The manual DD Form 1149 may be used when LTS inoperable.  The supervisor should contact the LTS help desk or base communication focal point and confirm there is a connectivity issue. 2.2.3.2.  Air Force equipment custodians are not permitted to ship any stock listed materiel via this method unless authorized by the Customer Support Section (LGRMC) (T-3).  Refer to  AFI  23-101,  Air  Force  Materiel  Management  and  AFMAN  23-122,  Materiel Management Procedures. 2.2.4.  Shippers are responsible for delivering the materiel to OC, unless other arrangements are made. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 25 2.3.  Shipment Planning.  Shipment planners determine best value mode/method and select the TSP to move the materiel to destination consistent with the delivery requirement.  The shipment planner considers the following: 2.3.1.  Shipment characteristics (e.g. size, weight, type pack, classification). 2.3.2.  Transportation  Priority  (TP),  see  Table  2.1.    999/NMCS/MICAP  must  be  packed, labeled and documented before general cargo items. (T-0).  Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 203, Shipper and Chapter 208, Packaging and Handling. 2.3.3.  Consignee location and receiving capability.  Consult the TFG within the Global Freight Management  (GFM)  application  at  the  SDDC  website.    If  the  consignee  does  not  have  an assigned  Department  of  Defense  Activity  Address  Code  (DoDAAC),  use  the  non-specific DoDAAC F00000 (F plus five zeroes).  For Foreign Military Sales (FMS) shipments, if the consignee does not have an assigned Military Assistance Program Address Code (MAPAC), contact the Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation Directorate, Transportation Office for assistance.  AF MAPACs begin with the letter “D.”  For specific MAPAC information visit the DLA website. 2.3.4.  Mode/Method.  Shipment planners must comply with paragraph 2.5. (T-2). 2.3.5.  Classified, Protected and AA&E Shipments.  See Chapter 4. 2.3.6.  National  Motor  Freight  Classification  (NMFC)  and  Type  Cargo  Code  (TCC).    The NMFC  in  Block  6  and  TCC  in  Block  8  of  the  DD  Form  1348-1A  are  used  for  shipment planning  purposes.    Note:  If  the  NMFC  or  TCC  on  the  DD  Form  1348-1A  is  erroneous, incomplete,  or  missing,  contact  the  LRS  Customer  Support  Section  in  the  Materiel Management Flight or the D035T Functional Manager at AFMC/A4RT for assistance.  Refer to  AFH  23-123V2PT2,  Integrated  Logistics  System-Supply  (ILS-S),  Standard  Base  Supply System Operations, Chapter 8 and the Military Freight Traffic Unified Rules Publication-1 (MFTURP-1) at the SDDC website. 2.3.7.  Cargo requires clearance into an air or water terminal for onward movement within the DTS.  See paragraph 2.7, and refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 202 for additional guidance. 2.3.8.  International  Shipments.   For information  on US  export documentation requirements and Electronic Export Information (EEI), refer to DTR, Part V. 2.3.8.1.  “Customs  Only”  GBL  for  shipments  to  Korea.    This  does  not  apply  to  FMS shipments.  Refer to DTR, Part V, Chapter 511, USPACOM and see paragraph 2.15.1. 2.3.8.2.  Shipments to Canada.

OCONUS  to  CONUS  shipments  using  unit/base  Operation  and  Maintenance (O&M) funds.  OCONUS shipping activities must complete an advanced DD Form 1384, Transportation Control and Movement Document (ATCMD), to include all miscellaneous trailer data record (T_9) with the Standard Document Number (SDN) or MORD. (T-1).  See Chapter 5 for additional information on obtaining a unit TAC for movement provided 26 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 by  AMC/SDDC  (airlift/sealift).    AMC  CONUS  aerial  ports  use  the  SDN/MORD  for onward CONUS movement using the CBL payment process under TPPS.  On the first T_9 line, enter the letters "SDN" followed by the data.  Use as many T_9s as necessary.  Enter a sequence number beginning with one for each T_9 entry. (T-2). 2.3.9.  Movement  by  United  States  Postal  Service  (USPS).    Follow  guidelines  in  to  DoD 4525.8-M, DoD Official Mail Manual, AF Supplement 1. 2.3.10.  Ensure a Transportation Control Number (TCN) is assigned to every shipment.  Refer to DTR, Part II, Appendix L, TCN. 2.3.10.1.  Notes:  (1) If automated means is not available, maintain a manual TCN log as shown in the example in Figure 2.1.  (2) OCONUS small package contract TSP services shipments must reflect the international foreign postal code (ZIP) and clear text address of the  consignee.  (T-1).    (3)  For  FMS  shipments  use  DTR,  Part  II,  Appendix  E,  Foreign Military  Sales,  to  assign  FMS  TCNs.    Contact  the  AFLCMC/WFALC,  Transportation Office for additional assistance. See paragraph 11.8.9. Figure 2.1.  Sample Manual TCN Log  2.3.11.  Shipment  Consolidation.    Consolidate  shipments  to  the  maximum  extent  possible having  compatible  line  items,  the  same  consignee/destination,  project  code,  and  TAC/fund citation; do not commingle serviceable and unserviceable materiel. (T-0).  999/NMCS/MICAP may be consolidated as long as ITV is maintained for each line item and does not cause delay in transportation. Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 203. 2.3.11.1.  For FMS Consolidations, refer to DTR, Part II, Appendix E. Note: In addition to the above guidelines, FMS consolidations must have the same:  U.S. Service Code, Recipient country, Mark-for/ship-to/freight forwarder location, FMS case designator, and Delivery Term Code (DTC). (T-1). 2.3.12.  Increased Liability Coverage and Excess Valuation.  TO’s are authorized to request excess  valuation  to  support  mission  requirements  IAW  the  DTR,  Part  II,  Chapter  202, Routing. 2.4.  Transportation Priorities  .  Determine TP by the Priority Designator (PD) on the DD Form 1348-1A (positions 60-61), or the priority identified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1149. See Table 2.1. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 27 Table 2.1.  Transportation Priorities  2.4.1.  For  non-MILSTRIP  shipments,  shippers  must  provide  written  justification  when requesting  expedited  transportation.  (T-2).    Justification  will  be  submitted  on  official memorandum signed by the competent authority (e.g. SQ/CC or equivalent) and attached to the shipping document. (T-1).  The TO may waive this requirement, in writing, for repetitive customers or other justifiable situations. 2.4.2.  TOs  will  use  the  most  efficient  means  available  to  meet  established  Time  Definite Delivery (TDD) transit times. (T-0).  Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 202 for transit times. 2.5.  Selecting Mode/Method.  Selecting Mode/Method.  Mode is a category of movement (e.g. air or surface), and method is a means of movement within a mode (e.g. motor, rail, AMC channel, small  package  air  TSP,  or  intermodal  container).    For  shipment  planning,  TOs  will  select  the mode/method  based  on  delivery  requirements  and  physical  characteristics  of  the  cargo  being moved  and  comply  with  DTR,  Part  II,  Chapter  202  and  Chapter  205,  TPS  Shipments,  for Transportation Protective Services (TPS) and Force Protection Condition (FPCON) requirements. (T-0). 2.5.1.  Air Eligible Shipments. 2.5.1.1.  Small package carrier contracts must be used if a shipment requires commercial express, time definite, door-to-door delivery to a small package Carrier location and falls within the limitations specified in the small package carrier contracts. (T-0).  Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 202. 2.5.1.2.  Use  AMC  approved  commercial  tenders  for  shipments  requiring  time  definite door to door delivery (e.g. TP-1 shipments coded 999/NMCS/MICAP) weighing more than 300 pounds OCONUS (150 pounds CONUS), or pay commercial air rates if no tender is 28 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 available.  When AMC approved tenders are not available over a specific channel, the TO documents a critical mission impact to use a onetime only rate IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter 202. 2.5.1.3.  AMC channel airlift is used when the commercial TSP express service tenders or contracts  exclude  movement  service  for  a  specific  shipment  unit  (i.e.  classified  or hazardous) or when host nation customs clearance requirements do not permit entry by a commercial method.  TOs will consider AMC Channel airlift if cost favorable or channel performance  exceeds  commercial  TSP  performance.  (T-1).    TP-3  shipments  are  not  air eligible except for items with short expiration dates to include, but not limited to, whole blood, perishable subsistence, batteries, biological, radioactive, required refrigeration, and like items.  In this situation, shippers must ensure the ATCMD properly identifies these exceptional characteristics of the TP-3 shipment, to justify air eligibility. (T-2). 2.5.1.4.  Deferred  Airfreight  (TP-4)  via  AMC  is  a  possible  alternative  to  surface movement,  depending  on  space  considerations.    TOs  should  maximize  use  of  deferred airfreight for movement of eligible TP-3 cargo.  Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 203 and AMCI 24-101, Volume 11, Cargo and Mail Policy. 2.5.2.  Surface Shipments. 2.5.2.1.  Sealift is the normal mode for over ocean movement of TP-3. Refer to DTR Part II,  Chapter  202,  Section  Y,  OCEAN,  AIR,  AND  MULTI-MODAL  SHIPMENT PROCEDURES. 2.5.2.2.  Within  the  CONUS,  use  express  TSP  ground  service  for  eligible  non 999/NMCS/MICAP  TP-1  and  TP-2  shipments  when  this  method  is  more  cost  effective than  standard  overnight  service  and  meets  TDD  standards.    For  destinations  within  500 miles of the origin, TOs should consider express ground vs air service to maximize cost savings while maintaining delivery within Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority System (UMMIPS) time standards. 2.5.2.3.  Within CONUS, TP-2, TP-3, and all other cargo requiring surface movement due to  physical  characteristics  will  move  on  trucks.  (T-1).  Consider  commercial  air  or expedited ground service when the cost is equal to, or less than, the normal truck cost. 2.5.2.4.  OCONUS ground will be done IAW Combatant Command (COCOM) guidance as long as DTR, Part II, Chapter 202 requirements are met. (T-0). 2.6.  Selecting  a  TSP.  TOs  apply  best  value  criteria  when  making  the  TSP  selection.    See Attachment 1 and refer to DTR, Part II, Definitions,  for additional best  value guidance.  TSPs, other than USPS, must have a contract or approved tender of service on file with AMC, General Services Administration (GSA), or SDDC. (T-0).  The TO must be aware of contracts supporting movement  from  their  installation  and  ensure  compliance  with  the  terms  of  the  contract  (e.g. mandatory use). (T-1). 2.6.1.  When routing less than truckload (LTL) shipments through the CMOS Automation of Transportation  Request  (ATR),  challenge  any  excessively  high  rates.    Validate  rates  in  the GFM  Rate  Quotation  application  or  by  contacting  the  SDDC  Domestic  Freight  Services Branch. 2.7.  Shipment Clearance Requirements. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 29 2.7.1.  CONUS Clearance Requirements.  The TO must clear shipments moving on military owned or arranged airlift and sealift through the appropriate clearance agency prior to release to TSP for movement to the aerial or water port of embarkation (APOE or WPOE). (T-0).  See Chapter 7 for further instruction and refer to DTR Part II, for the appropriate air and water clearance authorities.  AF cargo movement activities will use CMOS to clear shipments. (T-2). 2.7.2.  Air Clearance.  The TO requests ACA clearance of cargo planned for AMC  channel airlift prior to cargo release to the APOE.  To request a clearance, submit the ATCMD data to the sponsoring service ACA. The AF ACA clears or challenges the request for air movement.  The  requisitioning  activity  has  up  to  two  working  days  to  justify  airlift  of  challenged shipments.   The shipping TO will hold  the shipment  pending the  challenge decision by  the ACA IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter 202. (T-0).  In the event airlift clearance request is denied, the TO will divert the shipment to surface movement IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter 202. (T-0).  TOs can access the most current airlift eligibility and challenge procedures at the 635 SCOW SharePoint®  or  by  contacting  the  local  OCONUS  ACA.    The  following  specialized  cargo requires the shipper consult with the ACA prior to releasing the shipment.  Refer to the DTR, Part II, Appendix R for additional guidance on clearance authority and paragraphs 2.9 and 2.10 and DTR, Part II, Chapter 203 for Green Sheet and Purple Sheet requirements. 2.7.2.1.  Explosives.    Shipments  of  explosives  require  an  explosive  clearance  number, which the ACA must obtain for the shipper prior to release of shipment. (T-1).  Annotate explosive clearance numbers on the DD Form 1387, Military Shipping Label (MSL). 2.7.2.2.  Military Working Dogs  (MWD) (with handler).   The ATCMD  will include the dog's name, ID tag number, type of dog (i.e., drug, explosive, patrol), and handler's name and rank. (T-2).  Indicate on the trailer records how the dog and handler will arrive at the aerial  port  (commercial  flight  number,  date,  and  time).  (T-1).    MWDs  must  be  spaced blocked through AMC by the shipping activity. (T-1).  For CMOS users, enter the mission number on a T_9 line.  For guidance to space block through AMC, refer to AMCI 24-101, Vol 9, Air Terminal Operations Center, paragraph 12.5. 2.7.2.3.  Courier shipments.  Include name and rank of courier(s). 2.7.2.4.  Ration shipments include icing and other special handling requirements. 2.7.2.5.  Advance  notification  for  blood  and  medical  emergency  shipments  should  be  e-mailed to  the ACA.   To determine applicable ACA, refer to  DTR, Part  II, Appendix R, ACA/WCA. 2.7.3.  Water Clearance.  For CONUS export sealift, send the ATCMD to SDDC Operations.  For  OCONUS  sealift  requirements,  send  to  the  appropriate  Theater  Commander  (CDR) designated  Water  Clearance  Authority  (WCA).    Use  SDDC  Integrated  Booking  System software or submit on a DD Form 1086, Export Traffic Release Request.  Refer to DTR Part II, Appendix R. 2.7.4.  Clearance of Shipments into CONUS Designated Water Terminals.  The TO requests WCA  clearance  of  cargo  planned  for  direct  delivery  to  a  WPOE  prior  to  movement  of  the materiel.  WCA clears cargo offered for export from the CONUS ports.  Refer to DTR, Part II, Appendix R for procedures for shipment clearance into water terminals. 30 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 2.7.4.1.  When  sealift  eligible  cargo  is  insufficient  for  container  or  flat  rack  loading  at origin,  send  the  cargo  to  a  Consolidation  and  Containerization  Point  (CCP),  for  those shipments  that  qualify.    These  shipments  are  exempt  from  the  normal  sealift  clearance process. 2.7.4.2.  DLA operates CCPs on the East and West Coast of the United States.  The East Coast  CCPs  are  the  Defense  Distribution  Depot  Susquehanna,  New  Cumberland,  PA, (DDSP,  DoDAAC:  W25N14)  and  Norfolk  Intermodal  Hub,  DLA  Distribution  Norfolk, VA (NIMH, DoDAAC:  N45631).  The West Coast CCP is co-located with the Defense Distribution Depot San Joaquin, Tracy, CA, (DDJC, DoDAAC: W62N2A).  Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 203, for CCP procedures. 2.7.5.  Clearance of Shipments into OCONUS Military Air Terminals.  The TO requests ACA clearance  IAW  COCOM  directives  on  all  cargo  planned  for  movement  from,  or  within,  an overseas area via AMC prior to release of the materiel to the port. 2.7.6.  Clearance of Shipments into OCONUS Designated Water Terminals.  The TO requests WCA or Ocean Cargo Clearance Authority (OCCA) clearance IAW COCOM directives on all cargo planned for movement from or within an overseas area via MSC.  Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 202, for clearance procedures. 2.8.  Exception processing. 2.8.1.  Space  Blocking.    With  the  exception  of  AMC  FSL  project  code  196  cargo  directly supporting AMC airlift assets and MWDs with handlers, AF cargo will not be space blocked on AMC channel missions. (T-1).  Customers may change precedence of movement for cargo in the AMC channel through green and purple sheet procedures described in paragraphs 2.9 and 2.10 of this chapter. 2.8.2.  Movement on Opportune/Organic Airlift.  TOs may use AF opportune/organic airlift to move  AF  cargo  when  standard  commercial  or  AMC  channels  do  not  meet  mission requirements.  Refer to AMCI 24-101, Volume 11, Cargo and Mail Policy.  Note: Hazardous and protected materials will be transported IAW DTR, Part II, Chapters 204 and 205. (T-0). initiates  and  documents 2.8.2.1.  The  TO for  movement  by opportune/organic  airlift  with  the  aircraft’s  operational  support  authority  (e.g.  618th Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC)) or the respective theater Air Operations Center Air Mobility Division (AOC/AMD). the  requirement 2.8.2.1.1.  The  documentation  will  accompany  the  DD  Form  1348-1A  or  DD  Form 1149, and will identify the appropriate working capital fund (WCF) or SDT CMA TAC to  use  for  any  required  commercial  or  AMC  channel  movement  IAW  DTR,  Part  II, Appendix V5. (T-0). 2.8.2.1.2.  Do not use local funds to support any movement to position, deposition, or forward cargo identified for organic airlift support. 2.8.2.2.  If eligible cargo must move commercially from origin to another location to meet opportune or organic lift, the origin TO will use the TAC provided to process the shipment using  the  best  value  TSP  that  meets  the  RDD  IAW  DTR,  Part  II,  Chapter  202.  (T-0).  Shipment will be marked for the TO at the in transit node and transshipped in CMOS. (T-1).  Note: The origin TO shall provide 618 TACC, AOC/AMD, and AFSC/635 SCOW the AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 31 shipment details [TCN, piece/weight/cube (P/W/C), Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC) and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)] upon request. (T-1). 2.8.2.3.  The TO will use CMOS to manifest eligible cargo moved on organic air. (T-1). TOs will also generate a new manifest if cargo is trans-loaded to another opportune/organic air mission. (T-2). 2.8.2.4.  If the opportune or organic airlift movement is disrupted (e.g. the eligible cargo misses mission departure time, the mission diverts, etc.), the TO at the location with the cargo will process the shipment for onward movement IAW local procedures. (T-2).  Cargo will be in-checked and trans-shipped in CMOS. (T-1). 2.8.3.  Other exception processing issues. 2.8.3.1.  All  requests  for  exception  processing  must  be  in  writing  and  signed  by  the requesting unit’s commander. (T-1).  The TO will ensure the request contains all necessary information  to  support  timely  delivery  (e.g.  organizational  POC  for  requested  Saturday delivery). (T-1). TOs will not process exception shipment requests, which do not contain sufficient information to ensure successful delivery, to include afterhours receipt at final destination. (T-2). 2.8.3.2.  The TO approves or disapproves requests for movement of small package carrier eligible cargo that require use of Same Day Service or movement outside the small package carrier contracts. 2.8.3.3.  TOs process shipments after-hours that are air eligible 999/NMCS/MICAP. Cargo moving commercially is booked for the TSP’s next scheduled pick-up. (T-2). 2.9.  Green Sheet Procedures  .  Green Sheet is a process where specifically identified cargo in the  AMC  system  may  gain  movement  precedence  over  other  priority  cargo  of  the  sponsoring Service, including 999/NMCS/MICAP shipments.  Use it when expedited movement of specific shipments is in the national interest and the ACA certifies that it is an operational necessity.  Green Sheet applies through the final destination APOD.  Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 203. 2.9.1.  The ACA is the only activity authorized to levy Green Sheet action with the aerial port.  Blanket application is not authorized for Green Sheet action. 2.9.2.  Green Sheet requests must include TCN, P/W/C, consignee DoDAAC, APOE/APOD and  valid  reason  for  Green  Sheet  action  (i.e.,  aircraft  Not  Mission  Capable  (NMC),  work stoppage). (T-2).  Vague statements such as “urgently required” are not sufficient to warrant Green Sheet action.  Units (shipper) requesting Green Sheet action must be specific regarding their urgency of need, and an O-6 or above (or equivalent) from the requesting unit’s chain of command must sign the Green Sheet request memorandum. (T-1). 2.9.3.  Upon approval, the CONUS ACA will send the approved Green Sheet Request to the Customer Support Branch (CSB) at the CONUS aerial ports. (T-1). At OCONUS aerial ports, the  responsible  ACA  will  provide  the  completed  AMC  Form  101  to  the  Air  Terminal Operations Center (ATOC). (T-1). 2.10.  Purple  Sheet  Procedures.  COCOMs  require  the  ability  to  prioritize  sustainment  cargo during Lines of Communication (LOC) stress, or during shifts of contingency/combat operations.  The intent is to outline a process for the supported COCOM to prioritize sustainment cargo already on hand at an APOE, for subsequent flow into the COCOM AOR.  The COCOM utilizes Purple 32 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 Sheet  action  to  expedite  movement  of  specific  shipment(s)  of  national  interest  and  operational necessity.  It authorizes specifically identified cargo in the DTS in transit to the COCOM AOR to gain  movement  precedence over other priority  cargo in  transit to  the COCOM AOR, including 999/NMCS/MICAP and Green Sheet shipments, regardless of service lane or arrival date at the APOE.  Purple Sheet applies from initial identification to the shipment‘s final destination APOD.  Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 203. 2.10.1.  The COCOM J4 approves Purple Sheet requests and forwards them to the COCOM’s Deployment Distribution Operations Center (DDOC). 2.10.2.  After COCOM J4 approval, the DDOC will forward the Purple Sheet request to the USTC DDOC IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter 203. (T-0). 2.10.3.  The DDOC tasks 618 TACC which, in turn, tasks the applicable APOE.  The APOE will info copy the service ACA. (T-2).  Note: No blanket shipment or planeload Purple Sheet request will be approved. (T-1). 2.11.  Same  Day  Service  criteria.  Prior  to  utilizing  Same  Day  Service,  all  other  movement methods required for expedited movement  will  be explored.  (T-1).  Same Day Service is  not  a normal  means for movement, and is  considered  only  as an exception to  next  day service.   Use Same Day Service only in dire circumstances (e.g. mission failure).  Same Day Service moves via scheduled commercial air TSPs and does not include guaranteed arrival time.  Weight/size limits and other restrictions (e.g. authorized destination, additional charges, etc.), may vary per TSP and be  verified  and  agreed  upon  prior  to  pick  up.    Note:  The  TO  is  the  only  official  authorized  to approve the use of Same Day Service, see paragraph 2.8.3.2. (T-2) 2.11.1.  Shippers will provide a destination contact name, commercial and/or Defense Switch Network  (DSN)  contact  number  and  an  in  the  clear  address  for  the  consignee  before  the shipment is accepted by the TO’s shipping activity for transport. (T-1). 2.11.2.  Use of Same Day Service constitutes the consignee must be available at the time of delivery to accept the shipment. (T-2). 2.11.3.  Use of Same Day Service does not  preclude the TSP from  having an approved HQ AMC tender on file or HQ AMC approval for a one time rate quote.  Refer to DTR, Part II, for exceptions. 2.11.4.  The following criteria must be met before the TO makes the final decision to use Same Day Service: 2.11.4.1.  Shipment must have an Agile Logistics Project Code or an RDD of 999, N_ or E_. (T-1).  2.11.4.2.  Same Day Service will not be used if actual use of the item being shipped will not occur before normal next day delivery service. (T-1).  Exception: AMC MICAPs or Green/Purple Sheet Shipments to be delivered to an aerial port that have a scheduled airlift mission approved by the 618th Air Space Operations Center (AOC) /Aerial Port Control Center (APCC). 2.11.4.3.  The shipper requesting Same Day Service must provide the origin TO written or e-mailed justification endorsed by an O-6 (or equivalent) or above, to verify the urgency of movement. (T-1).  Supporting documentation will include a brief justification, named consignee and contact details, RDD, and signature block. (T-1).  The TO will maintain one AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 33 copy of the justification with the shipping document and one copy will be included with the  shipment  packing  list.  (T-1).    Note:  Blanket  Same  Day  Service  requests  are  not authorized. 2.11.4.4.  The TO/designated agent must certify that all services were performed and retain the delivery confirmation with the shipping documentation. (T-2). 2.12.  Express TSP Shipment Documentation  .  TCNs are automatically entered at CMOS sites using the standard Industry Information Processor (I2P) capability.  I2P is defined in Attachment 1. 2.12.1.  The  TCN  on  the  TSP  waybill  alerts  the  TSP  tracking  system  to  forward  shipment information  to  DoD  in-transit  visibility  systems  and  allows  for  TCN  tracking  using  the commercial  TSP‘s  tracking  system.    The  TCN  links  express  TSP  and  shipper  information systems and provides data for pipeline analysis. 2.12.2.  For non I2P transactions, enter the TCN in the first 17 positions of the field, enter one space, and then enter the TAC in positions 19-22.  Spaces, other than the one between the TCN and TAC or additional characters not part of the TCN or TAC should not be included.  Data must be entered in this order by either using TSP provided software or filling out the air waybill manually. (T-1). See example at Figure 2.2. Figure 2.2.  Entering the Transportation Control Number 2.13.  Export/Import of Goods.  2.13.1.  US  Import.    To  ensure  shipments  flow  through  US  Customs,  OCONUS  shipping offices must provide the following information on all commercial air shipments: 2.13.1.1.  Airway Bill.  The first line of the shipper block must identify the DoD component as the shipper followed by the shipper unit.  (T-1).  The consignee block must start with United  States  (sponsoring  military  service),  followed  by  the  recipient  name.  (T-1).  Providing  the  sponsoring  component  command  is  critical  on  shipments  consigned  to commercial contractors and vendors. 2.13.1.2.  Commercial  Invoice.    Print  the  commercial  invoice  on  Air  Force  letterhead.  Shipper and consignee information must reflect the sponsoring component command, and include a clear detailed description of the item, item value, and a statement of ownership, (e.g.  Property  of  the  United  States  Government).  (T-1).    Print  the  American  Goods Returned (AGR) statement on the commercial invoice.  Refer to 19 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Section §10.103 AGR & CFR title 22 Section §126.4 (a) (1). 2.13.2.  US Export.  To comply with host nation customs clearance and routing requirements, refer to DTR, Part V.  Access DTR, DoD 4500.54 E, DoD Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), CFR Titles and Customs Bulletins at the USTRANSCOM website. 34 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 2.13.2.1.  Accurate cargo descriptions and complete addresses are essential requirements for all international shipments of DoD cargo, especially when commercial transportation is used. 2.13.2.1.1.  Use  of  non  specific  terms  such  as  Consolidated  Cargo,  General Merchandise,  Not  Otherwise  Specified  (NOS),  Said  to  Contain  (STC),  Freight  All Kinds  (FAK),  or  No  Description  (Blank)  is  not  acceptable  for  customs  clearance purposes.  Similarly, avoid generic descriptions such as “aircraft part,” which may also cause delays in the customs clearance process. 2.13.2.1.2.  Use the Harmonized Code to determine the best descriptive nomenclature based on National Stock Number (NSN), NMFC, part number and other data presented by  the  supply  activity  or  vendor.    Visit  the  United  States  International  Trade Commission website. 2.13.2.1.3.  Use the AF DoDAAC Web Management System to determine the correct consignee  address  for  shipments  to  DoD  activities.    Use  in  the  clear  name  of  the consignee, as well as the required DoDAAC address.  Visit the DoDAAC website. 2.13.2.2.  IAW 22 CFR  Section §120.5, the Department  of State regulates the export of articles covered by the USML, except as indicated otherwise in the subchapter.  If the item is  on  the  USML,  it  requires  an  Electronic  Export  Declaration  (EEI),  formerly  Shipper's Export  Declaration  (SED)  for  export.    If  the  item  is  not  on  the  USML  (i.e.,  a  general commodity), then no EEI is required IAW 15 CFR Section §30.52.  Refer to DTR, Part V, Chapter 508. 2.14.  Preventing DoD Shipments to Restricted Countries. 2.14.1.  Consign and route DoD shipments to authorized destinations.  All shipping activities will  maintain  the  most  current  list  of  embargoed  countries  from  the  Department  of  State Embargoed Countries List at the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls website IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter 201. (T-0). 2.14.2.  The TO will follow the provision of DTR Part II, Chapter 201 and have a program in place in order to ensure appropriate level (LRS/CC or APS/CC) review and approve the release of shipments to restricted countries. (T-2). 2.15.  Commercial  Bill  of  Lading  (CBL).  A  CMOS  produced  CBL  designates  the  receipt  of goods shipped on board a tendered or contracted commercial transportation conveyance (e.g. truck, rail, ship, airplane) and signed by the TSP (or TSP’s agent) who contracts to carry and deliver the freight.  The CBL states the terms on which the goods are carried.  Follow guidance in the DTR, Part  II,  Chapter  206,  regarding  the  accountability,  application,  issuance,  preparation  and distribution  of  freight  CBLs,  and  for  instructions  for  the  procurement  of  transportation  from commercial TSPs. 2.15.1.  Republic of Korea.  With regard to specific customs requirements, Korea is the only country that requires a GBL.  Refer to DTR, Part V, Chapter 511.  To enable these shipments to move on a GBL and still allow payment TPPS/Syncada, the following guidance applies: 2.15.1.1.  For TPPS TSPs – In the “Bill Charges To” block, show the address: US Bank, 601 Second Ave South, Minneapolis, MN 55402.  Place one copy of the GBL in the Packing List on the outside of the number 1 piece and give one copy to the TSP.   AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 35 2.15.1.2.  For non TPPS TSPs – In the “Bill Charges To” block, show the address: AFMC/A4RT, 4375 Chidlaw Rd, Bldg 262, Rm C117, WPAFB, OH 45433 5066 2.15.2.  Use  the  following  procedures  when  processing  a  “Customs  Only”  GBL  through CMOS: 2.15.2.1.  Utilize CMOS I2P or TSP system IAW paragraph 2.12 of this chapter 2.15.2.2.  Prepare a GBL in CMOS and release the GBL from CMOS.  Note: Do not use duplicate  GBL  numbers  for  customs  clearance  into  the  Republic  of  Korea.    There  have been occurrences of delays because of duplicate GBL numbers. 2.15.2.3.  Clearly State "For Customs Purposes Only" in the GBL remarks section. 2.16.  Other Shipment Requirements. 2.16.1.  Shipment and Receipt of Aircraft Engines and Built Up Propellers (BUPs).  TOs must process  documentation on aircraft engines and  BUPs  for movement  according to  Technical Order  (T.O.)  00-85-20,  Engine  Shipment  Instructions,  for  engine  movements.  (T-1).  Commercial vehicles moving aircraft engines and BUPs must have both an air ride tractor and trailer in operating and serviceable condition. (T-1).  At a minimum, Routing Instruction Notes (RINs) 111, 344 and 367 will be printed on the Bill of Lading (BL). (T-1).  The TO and Base Engine  Manager  will  develop  and  publish  local  written  procedures  to  ensure  rapid  engine shipment  receipt  and  release,  and  a  thorough  visual  inspection  process  that  meets  mission requirements.  (T-1).    Due  to  the  various  number  of  TACs  used  to  support  the  shipment  of aircraft engines, it is vital that the TO ensures the proper funding source is cited.  Note: Aircraft engine shipments to a Centralized Repair Facility (CRF) are funded by the installation shipping the  engine  (for  CONUS  movements  only).    Refer  to  AFI  65-601V1,  Budget  Guidance  and Procedures and the SDT CMA TAC Memorandum. 2.16.2.  Munitions  Shipment  and  Receipt.    TOs  coordinate  with  installation  munitions  and safety  personnel  to  develop  local  written  procedures  to  ensure  proper  documentation, movement  and  receipt  handling  instructions  are  available  for  munitions  shipments.    Note: Refer to AFI 21-201, for additional guidance on munitions transportation. (T-2). 2.16.3.  Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE).  TMDE are non-MILSTRIP shipments, usually assigned project code 571.  Normally, TMDE shipments are consigned to the destination TO, with PMEL as the ultimate consignee.  Shippers will prepare a DD Form 1149 and each package  should have the appropriate PMEL Shipping  Label  attached.  (T-1).  For transportation funding, see Chapter 5. 2.16.4.  Source of Repair (SOR) Shipment and Receipt.  TOs at installations with a SOR will coordinate with SOR personnel to develop local procedures to ensure proper documentation, movement, and receipt handling instructions are available for SOR cargo. (T-1). 2.16.5.  Aircraft Wreckage Recovery and Investigative Evidence.  TOs coordinate with safety personnel  and  support  aircraft  wreckage  recovery  efforts  according  to  AFI  91-204,  Safety Investigations and Reports.  TOs will ship investigative evidence as TP-1 by the nearest DoD shipping  activity  using  Air  Force  organizations  and  equipment  to  the  maximum  extent possible.  (T-1).    Note:  TOs  must  ship  time  critical  investigative  evidence  such  as  data recorders (i.e., black boxes), or suspect mishap components, by the fastest means available. (T-2). 36 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 2.16.6.  Hazardous Materials.  HAZMAT policy is located in the DTR Part II, Chapter 204.  All personnel should be aware of the possibility of undeclared or hidden HAZMAT and refer any  potential  undeclared  shipments  to  HAZMAT  preparer  qualified  personnel.    Refer  to AFMAN 24-204 for indicators of hidden HAZMAT. 2.16.6.1.  Shipper Certification. International, federal, and military regulations require the shipper  to  certify  that  hazardous  materials  are  properly  identified,  described,  packaged, marked, labeled, and in proper condition for transportation. 2.16.6.2.  Preparers  certify  that  hazardous  materials  are  properly  classified,  described, packaged,  marked  and  labeled,  and  in  proper  condition  according  to  the  applicable regulations.  Preparers include Technical Specialists.  These individuals are qualified based on their training in handling and preparing hazardous material in the performance of their duties. 2.16.6.2.1.  Technical specialists may only certify items they are technically qualified to maintain and prepare for shipment for mobility purposes and/or as indicated in DTR Part II, Chapter 204, Paragraph D.1.c., for transportation of HAZMAT. 2.16.6.2.2.  When Deployment and Distribution Flight personnel are required to certify item(s)  that  require  special  preparation  (e.g.  munitions,  engines,  etc.),  the  item "Technical Specialist" or preparing activity will provide documentation indicating the item is prepared properly for shipment IAW applicable T.O.s, DoD guidance, and 49 CFR. (T-1). 2.16.6.3.  Preparing  Fuel  Devices  for  Shipment.    Drain  and  purge  aerospace  ground equipment (AGE), aircraft, and vehicle fuel devices and equipment IAW their applicable T.O.  procedures  prior  to  shipment.    Generally,  purging  of  fuel  devices  occurs  only  at facilities  with  depot  level  maintenance.    Field  units  will  ship  fuel  devices  which  may contain trapped residual fuel as UN3363, “dangerous goods in apparatus” or “dangerous goods in machinery” as appropriate and should be offered as Drained but not Purged. (T-1).  AGE, aircraft, and vehicle “wetted fuel” items will not be accepted (inducted) into the Material Management or Deployment and Distribution Flight without documented proof (i.e., AFTO Form 20, Caution Tag, or other locally produced documentation), certifying the equipment has been properly drained and purged or that the item has been drained only. (T-1).  Ensure the following conditions are met before offering AGE/aircraft/vehicle/ fuel devices  for  commercial  and  military  transportation  (air  or  surface).  Drying  an  item  in  a bucket does not meet drained and purged transportation requirements. 2.16.6.3.1.  Ensure strict compliance with Technical Order procedures for draining and purging the fuel parts.  When purging cannot be accomplished, ship devices as fully regulated hazardous materials/dangerous goods and comply with the appropriate modal regulations.    Remove  all  excess  purging  fluid  as  required  and  ensure  the  part  is completely cleaned. 2.16.6.3.2.  The AFTO Form 20 (or other documentation) must be signed (to include printed full name) in the appropriate block or with the inspection stamp by personnel accomplishing the documentation  “drained  and  purged”  or  “drained  and  not  purged.”    Include  residual fuel type (e.g. JP8) with the volume remaining. the  draining  and  purging  procedures.  (T-1).   Annotate AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 37 2.16.6.3.3.  Do  not  cover  plates  on  openings  until  the  documentation  is  completed. Then properly cap and seal drain openings, open lines and fittings as specified in the item Technical Order. 2.16.6.3.4.  The TO must ensure documentation is attached to the item(s), checked for completeness, and signed (certifying the condition of the item), prior to acceptance. (T-2).  If additional hazards are suspected, frustrate the shipment and coordinate with the appropriate  fuels,  maintenance  or  vehicle  technician  to  resolve.    Only  qualified maintenance technicians will perform the required procedures to prepare the equipment for shipment. (T-1). 2.16.6.3.5.  If the T.O. data covering the parts/equipment does not require drain and/or purge procedures prior to shipping, then these parts do not require documented proof.  This includes, but is not limited to, AGE and aircraft parts containing hydraulic fluids, oils  and  lubricants  (fluids  nonhazardous  for  transportation).    Certain  aircraft  parts received from Materiel Management have fluid in them and are ready for installation on the aircraft.  These fluids are essential for parts to operate. 2.16.6.3.6.  Package  any  item  containing  residual  fluid  (fuel)  in  a  greaseproof, waterproof sealed bag (MIL-DTL-117) according to the SPI.  Use of a proper barrier bag  prevents  contact  of  residual  fuel  with  the  outer  container  and  reduce  petroleum odors.  When reusing packaging, inspect for presence of residue or stains.  Do not reuse any packaging stained from a petroleum product. 2.16.6.3.7.  Mark each outer container with the type of material and flash point for the purging fluid.  This helps identify that odors are from a non-regulated purging fluid and not from a hazardous material (flammable liquid). 2.16.6.4.  Inert  Certification.    IAW  T.O.  11A-1-60,  General  Instructions  Inspection  of Reusable Munitions Containers and Scrap Material Generated from Items Exposed to, or Containing  Explosives,  a  certifying  official  inspects  and  completes  a  certificate  of clearance prior to offering the cargo for movement. The certificate identifies the item(s) inspected  and  states  they  are  100%  inert  and/or  free  of  explosive  related  materials.  The certificate  must  accompany  the  item(s)  at  all  times  while  in  distribution.  (T-1).    Cargo Movement has the authority to validate inspection and/or request re-inspection any item. 2.16.6.5.  Hazardous Waste.  Refer to AFI 32-7042, Waste Management. 2.16.6.6.  Radioactive Waste.  Handle, document, ship and dispose of radioactive/mixed waste in accordance with the appropriate modal directive listed in AFI 40-201.  Do not ship any radioactive/mixed waste until it is cleared and has a control number issued by the Air Force  Radioactive  Recycling  and  Disposal  Office  (AFRRAD).    Contact  AFRAAD  at:  88ABW/CEIEC,  1450  Littrell Road, WPAFB, OH 45433-5209;  Office (937) 257-2010, DSN  787-2010,  Mobile  (937)  269-4487,  e-mail  AFRRAD@us.af.mil.    Additional information may be found on the AFRAAD SharePoint®. 2.16.6.7.  Reshipment/Transshipment  Procedures.  HAZMAT  that  has  been  previously packaged  and  certified,  must  be  thoroughly  checked,  and  recertified  as  required,  when originating  as  a  new  shipment  or  changing  to  a  different  mode/method  at  a  transship location. (T-1).  If there is any indication that the HAZMAT package does not fully comply with federal, military or international packaging/certification requirements, then frustrate 38 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 the shipment and take action to ensure the required compliance standards are met prior to release for shipment. 2.16.7.  Loading TSP’s conveyance. 2.16.7.1.  Lifting  and  Tiedown  Procedures.    Proper  tiedown,  lifting,  and  loading procedures will be used to ensure cargo is delivered on time and without damage.  (T-0).  SDDC  Transportation  Engineering  Agency  (TEA)  publications  provide  guidance  on tiedown,  lifting,  and  loading  procedures  for  surface  movement.  Refer  to  DTR,  Part  II, Chapter 202. 2.16.7.2.  Operation of GMVs within OC.  Personnel shall only operate to those vehicles identified on their AF Form 2293 and those that can be operated with only a State motor vehicle operator’s license. (T-1). 2.17.  Personal  Property  Shipments  in  the  DTS.  The  DTR,  Part  II  and  Part  IV,  Joint  Travel Regulations (JTR), and AFI 24-501, Personal Property Moving and Storage, provide procedures, circumstances  and  conditions  for  movement  of  household  goods,  unaccompanied  baggage,  and privately  owned  vehicles  at  U.S.  Government  expense.    Controls  similar  to  cargo  apply  when personal effects are moving in the DTS. 2.17.1.  Excess baggage (e.g. personal effects, issued  Individual Protective Equipment (IPE)) incidental to a deployment will not be shipped through OC unless otherwise authorized by this AFI. (T-2). 2.18.  Outbound Cargo Accountability.  TOs must implement security measures to prevent or reduce  the  potential  for  theft  of  DoD  materiel.  (T-2).    Physically  account  for  materiel  on-hand awaiting movement; record the document number or TCN, piece count and consignee DoDAAC.  Establish and maintain procedures to report and rectify adverse findings. 2.18.1.  TPS required items (refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 205, Table 205-7).  100 percent physical verification, record the tally at the end of each shift. At the start of each shift perform a  physical  examination  and  compare  the  on-hand  balance  to  the  previous  shift’s  listing  to determine if any theft or pilferage has occurred. (T-2). 2.18.2.  TPS not required items.  100 percent physical verification, record the tally at the end of the established workweek. At the start of a new workweek perform a physical examination and compare the on-hand balance to the previous week’s listing to determine if any theft or pilferage has occurred. (T-3). 2.19.  Releasing Freight 2.19.1.  Report of Shipment (REPSHIP).  See paragraph 4.5. 2.19.2.  RFID.  See Chapter 15. 2.19.3.  Billing and Transportation Payment.  See Chapters 5 and 6. 2.20.  Outbound Discrepancies.  See Chapter 11. 2.21.  Degraded Operations.  When CMOS is not available, ensure all documentation is retained and all backlog is inputted for accountability. Cargo movement manpower is calculated using the workload factors pulled from CMOS and ILS-S.  Not in-checking cargo and processing shipments and receipts once the systems are restored could cause a loss in earned manpower. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 39 2.22.  Outbound Cargo Documentation Files.  TOs will maintain outbound documentation files that substantiates proof of shipment and the release of cargo from their installation. This includes, but is not limited to, bills of lading, funding documents, REPSHIPs, TCMDs and truck manifests with supporting documentation.  Note: Classified and unclassified cargo will be filed according to their classification.

Complete and distribute the REPSHIP, see paragraph 4.5 and 4.8.9. (T-1). 4.8.8.  Defense Transportation Tracking System (DTTS).  When satellite tracking services are required, shippers must monitor the in  transit status  of shipments  in  DTTS until  delivery is confirmed.  The TO will ensure a minimum of two accounts are established to access the DTTS website. (T-0).  Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 205 for DTTS procedures. 4.8.9.  REPSHIP Suspense. 4.8.9.1.  OC will maintain an outbound REPSHIP suspense file in CMOS. (T-1). 4.8.9.2.  OC  will  establish  an  estimated  delivery  date  for  arrival  at  the  final  destination based on TDD standards. (T-1). 4.8.9.3.  CMOS send an automated REPSHIP notification upon shipment release to those receiving activities supported by the Distribution Standard System (DSS) or CMOS.  OC forwards a manual REPSHIP (via email or fax) to destination sites not supported by DSS or CMOS.  OC calls the destination and confirms the system in use when uncertainty exists about  the  receiver’s  capabilities.    OC  personnel  must  ensure  the  appropriate  delivery method  (automated  or  manual)  is  used  based  on  the  destination’s  ability  to  receive notifications.  (T-1).  OC  forwards  a  manual  REPSHIP  to  the  port  of  embarkation,  if applicable. (T-1). 4.8.9.4.  OC  validates  receipt  of  a  REPSHIP  acknowledgement  from  destination.    If  no acknowledgement  is  received  within  30  minutes  for  next  day  small  package  carrier shipments  or within 24 hours for other shipments,  OC sends an e-mail REPSHIP to  the destination and follow-up to ensure receipt. 4.8.9.5.  If  OC  does  not  receive  confirmation  of  receipt  of  the  cargo  by  the  estimated delivery date on the REPSHIP, they initiate immediate tracer actions. Inform the security officer  when  the  shipment  cannot  be  accounted  for.    For  NWRM  shipments,  they  also notify the shipping NWRM Accountable Officer (NWRMAO) or Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO). 4.8.9.6.  If CMOS is unavailable, OC forwards a manual REPSHIP (via e-mail or fax) and captures the information in CMOS when the system is available. 4.9.  Inbound Cargo Requirements. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 51 4.9.1.  Only authorized personnel will be allowed to in-check and/or receipt for a shipment of classified and protected cargo. (T-1).  See paragraph 4.2.1 and 4.2.2. 4.9.2.  IC  personnel  use  the  AF  Form  4388,  Inbound  Transportation  Protective  Service Materiel Worksheet, when receiving TPS shipments.  The worksheet will be accomplished in conjunction with the in-check process (T-2), see paragraph 3.2.  The certifier will be a 7-skill level 2T0 or technical specialist. (T-3). Waiver authority for a 5-skill level Staff Sergeant or civilian equivalent to certify the form will be at the LRS/APS commander level.  (T-2). The individual performing the tasks and certification cannot be the same person. 4.9.3.  IC personnel must handle all small package carrier deliveries as classified shipments until it is verified that the shipment is unclassified. (T-1). 4.9.4.  All classified and protected assets are immediately in-checked into CMOS upon arrival and examined to ensure seals are intact and there is no evidence of damage or tampering with the container.  Provide hand-to-hand receipt control for classified and protected assets.  Hand-to-hand  receipt  documents  are  maintained  with  the  BL  and  supporting  documents  and maintained IAW AFRIMS Table 24 - 01. 4.9.4.1.  Hand-to-hand  receipt.    iRAPT,  Invoicing,  Receipt,  Acceptance  and  Property Transfer, DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, DD Form 1149 and DD Form 1348-1A are common forms that may be used as a hand receipt but must include the additional data as shown in Figure 4.2  (T-1).  The TO may direct  IC to use the DD Form 1907 as the standard form for all hand receipts.  All non-MILSTRIP shipments will be  turned  over  to  the  ultimate  consignee  using  the  CMOS  Surface  Freight  Inbound Turnover Records capability (T-1). Figure 4.2.  Custody Record for Hand-to-Hand Receipt  4.9.5.  IC  personnel  verify  the  information  on  the  DD  Form  1387  affixed  to  the  shipment matches  the  information  on  the  movement  document.    Open  all  shipping  containers  and perform  a  physical  examination  of  the  asset  and  utilize  the  source  document  inside  the container to verify item identification and process materiel receipt.  A unit pack that contains a single item  of supply,  and is  properly tagged, labeled or marked (refer  to  MIL-STD-129) should not  be opened unless there is  evidence of mishandling, damage to contents, error or intent to mislead IC personnel. SDSs, hazardous declaration forms, or similar forms are not approved receiving documents. (T-1). 4.9.6.  REPSHIP Process.  See paragraph 4.5. 4.9.6.1.  Receiving activities will maintain inbound REPSHIP suspense files in CMOS. (T-1). 4.9.6.2.  CMOS  inbound  suspense  files  auto  populates  shipments  from  DSS  and  other CMOS sites.  Inbound personnel manually enter other REPSHIPS (e-mail, fax) received 52 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 into CMOS.  The inbound suspense files also auto populates with status information for shipments handled at an in-transit DSS or CMOS activities. 4.9.6.3.  Inbound  personnel  initiate  immediate  tracer  actions  and  inform  their  security officer for shipments not received by the estimated delivery date.  For NWRM shipments, also notify the receiving NWRMAO or MASO. 4.9.6.4.  Inbound personnel in-check shipments into CMOS to close out the REPSHIP.  In-check immediately to ensure timely close out.  Note: This also close out shipment tracking in DTTS.  If the system is unavailable, use the DTTS web site and close out the shipment record. 4.9.6.5.  In  addition  to  REPSHIPs,  all  NWRM  shipments  require  an  official  e-mail (NIPRNET) sent by the origin shipper to the destination receiving unit to ensure all parties are fully aware of the shipment.  Notification will be made within 2 hours (CONUS) and 8 hours  (OCONUS)  of  releasing  an  outbound  shipment.  (T-0).    Refer  to  DTR,  Part  II, Chapter 205. Send the e-mail to the NWRM Transaction Control Center (NTCC) and to the  organizational  e-mail  accounts  of  the  origin  and  destination  NWRMAO/MASO  or contractor  receiving  activity,  as  appropriate.    E-mail  should  contain  the  movement document number and shipment TCN(s). (T-1). 4.9.7.  TPS  Discrepancy  Reporting.    Report  all  discrepancies  for  classified,  protected, HAZMAT and AA&E shipments to the security manager and immediately begin remediation actions (e.g. tracer action, SDR/TDR, report of survey investigation, etc.).  The discrepancy report (TDR or SDR) and supporting documentations must be sent to AFIMSC/IZSL, ANG or AFRC,  as  appropriate  within  12  hours  of  discovery.  (T-1).    For  further  TDR  guidance,  see DTR, Part II, Chapter 210, TDRs.  For SDRs, see chapter 11 and Attachment 9. (T-1). 4.10.  Special Provisions. 4.10.1.  Contingency, Deployment, and Mobility  Cargo moving under a Time Phased Force Deployment  Data  (TPFDD).    AF  Forms  4387  and  4388  are  not  required  for  TPFDD contingency, deployment, or mobility cargo that is transported using organic lift and escorted by couriers from origin to destination. (T-2). 4.10.2.  Emergency Hot Lines.  Use the SDDC and DTTS emergency hot line numbers located in  the  DTR,  Part  II,  Chapter  205  to  obtain  any  type  of  DoD  safety  or  security  advice  and assistance. (T-2). 4.10.3.  Explosives.    AFMAN  91-201,  Explosives  Safety  Standards,  provides  guidance  on hazard  classification,  firefighting,  handling,  transportation,  storage,  and  compatibility  of explosives.    Consult  the  explosives  facility  license  or  explosives  site  plan  for  authorized locations to store ammunition and explosives. (T-2). 4.10.4.  Military Vehicle Surface Movement.  Units/personnel (e.g. Transportation, Security Forces)  that  transport  HAZAMT  (to  include  AA&E)  aboard  Government  Motor  Vehicles (GMVs) over public highways comply with 49 CFR and applicable overseas regulations. (T-0).    Refer  to  DTR,  Part  II,  Chapters  204  and  205.  Unless  otherwise  exempt  by  49  CFR, HAZMAT will be marked, labeled and placarded when transported  (T-0); refer to 49 CFR, Section  §172.301,  §172.400a  and  §172.504.    All  shipments  transported  by  GMVs  will  be processed in CMOS; the Truck Manifest will be used to document transportation services, list AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 53 the consignee and consignor, describe the shipment and when required, and serve as shipping papers for HAZMAT. (T-1). 4.10.5.  Shipping Military Working Dog (MWD) Drug Training Aids/Controlled Substance(s).  These shipments will not be processed through the LRS. (T-1).  Security Forces follows policy in AFI 31-121 and the Drug Training Aid Accountability Guide to return these items. 54 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 Chapter 5 AIR FORCE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING 5.1.  General.  AF  shippers  will  comply  with  the  provisions  in  DTR,  Part  II,  Appendix  V, Attachment  V-5,  USAF  TAC,  paragraph  B.3,  to  determine  valid  Air  Force  TACs  and  funding responsibility. (T-0).  For shipments originating from an ANG location, refer to the Air National Guard Funding Policy SharePoint®. (T-1).  For FMS shipments refer to DTR, Part II, Attachment V-7. 5.2.  Air Force Working Capital Fund (WCF).  WCF funded shipments are identified by a Fund Code of 64, 6B or C, and Budget Code 8 and 9.  The Fund Code and Budget Code is linked to the National Stock Number (NSN) and can be used for MILSTRIP and Non-MILSTRIP shipments, CONUS or OCONUS, and any DOC ID, AF and ANG.  See Table 5.1 for WCF shipments. Table 5.1.  WCF Shipments  5.3.  FMS shipments of WCF materiel.  Only the CONUS inland portion of transportation (to the  aerial/water  port  or  FMS  freight  forwarder),  is  the  funding  responsibility  of  the  shipping activity using WCF.  Shippers use the appropriate WCF TACs as shown on the WCF TAC table.  The balance of transportation charges is funded through the FMS Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA), or paid by the FMS customer's freight forwarder. FMS shipment costs should be covered by either Working Capital Fund (WCF) or the FMS case involved. 5.4.  Air  Force SDT  Centrally Managed Account (CMA).  SDT CMA Funding Guidance  is published yearly and available on line at the AFMC/A4RT TPPS PMO SharePoint® and on the Logistics Tools Suite (LTS) Home Page. 5.4.1.  For assistance with Air Force CMA TAC funding assignments, contact the SDT CMA Program Manager, 635 SCOW, at DSN 576-3430, commercial (618) 256-3430 or contact the appropriate  TAC  Manager  assigned  in  the  current  FY  SDT  CMA  TAC  Table.    Note:  The AFMC/A4RT  Cargo  Movement  SharePoint®  site  also  provides  shippers  and  transporters current SDT CMA funding restrictions and detailed requirements for the use of these TACs. 5.4.2.  Program offices issued a SDT CMA TAC will assign a CMA TAC Manager to oversee execution of the SDT usage for their program. (T-1).  This is accomplished by reviewing the SDT CMA TAC burn rate charts, available on the 635 SCOW Portal website. 5.4.3.  SDT CMA TAC Managers and/or Program Offices will immediately notify the SDT CMA Program Office of any shipment(s) that is/are suspect and should not have been moved AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 55 on the cited TAC, so that cost adjustments/recovery efforts can be initiated. (T-1).  The SDT CMA Program Manager relies on the CMA TAC managers and/or program office to identify suspect shipments.  This oversight ensures the SDT CMA TACs are used for their intended purposes. 5.5.  Local  O&M  Transportation  Funds.  TOs  must  forecast  and  budget  for  sufficient  local O&M  funds  under  Element  of  Expense  Investment  Code  (EEIC)  462**,  Trans  Property  via Commercial  Carrier,  to  support  shipments  for  authorized  base  units  when  use  of  Air  Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) or SDT CMA funds are not applicable. (T-1). 5.5.1.  When  local  funds  apply,  use  the  complete  funding  appropriation  on  BLs,  to  include Standard Document Number (SDN). 5.5.2.  When shipments are entitled to move in the DTS, but  are funded by unit/base O&M funds, a TAC chargeable to the O&M funds must be established prior to using AMC, MSC, or SDDC services. (T-1).  Units accomplish TAC requests through the AF TAC Coordinator in AFMC/A4RT. 5.5.3.  To request a local TAC, access the LTS website and select TAC Request.  For guidance regarding  Air  Force  TAC  requests  and  applications,  see  DTR,  Part  II,  Appendix,  V, Attachment V-5. 5.6.  Repair  Network  Integration  (RNI)  Shipments.  Funding  responsibilities  regarding transportation of RNI assets OCONUS and CONUS, to and from CRF locations, are described in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Chapter 10, paragraph 10.41.5, Table 18.1 and Table 18.2. 5.7.  Transportation Funding Procedures.  The shipment originator is responsible for ensuring the correct appropriations (appropriate TAC or funding (SDN/MORD)) have been assigned and annotated  on  the  shipping  document.    This  applies  for  MILSTRIP  or  non-MILSTRIP  and regardless of Service Component or agency.  TOs will validate the funding provided to ensure it is  valid,  funded,  and  appropriate  IAW  DTR,  Part  II,  Appendix  V5.  (T-0).    Cargo  Movement personnel will use CMOS Pre-Shipment funds validation, Tracker Lite, Transportation Global Edit Table (TGET), and current funding guidance (funding memos, messages, etc.) to ensure proper funding is applied. (T-0).  Refer to DTR, Part II, Appendix V5. For non-MILSTRIP requests, the TO is authorized to refuse shipments if the shipper provided funding is not successfully validated in CMOS, when a valid SDN/MORD is not provided, or when TO cannot provide sufficient O&M to fund the shipment. 5.7.1.  Funding Identification for MILSTRIP shipment.  LRS Commanders ensure procedures are in place to ensure the appropriate/applicable TAC is printed on DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document, prior to delivery to the TO.  LRS Materiel Management personnel have inherent expertise to identify shipments as IM directed Redistribution Order (RDO) or lateral support through interpreting the document identifier.  This is especially critical during degraded operations. (T-1). 5.7.2.  Non-MILSTRIP Shipments.  See Attachment 3. 5.7.3.  In  the  event  that  a  discrepancy  between  funding  citations  on  the  DD  Form  1348-1A/1149 and CMOS  pre-shipment  funds validation/Tracker  Lite, CMOS/Tracker  Lite takes precedence. 56 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 5.7.3.1.  CMOS/Tracker  Lite  Funding  determination  challenges  will  be  directed  to AFMC/A4RT. (T-1).  TOs forward the DD Form 1348-1A/1149 and the CMOS Shipment Planning  Detail  screen  shot  to  HQAFMCA4.A4RT.FundsValidation@us.af.mil  or accomplish a TAC Exception request via Tracker Lite, Funds Validation. 5.8.  Other  Transportation  Funding  Considerations.  See  DTR,  Part  II,  Appendix  V, Transportation Account Code (TAC) Procedures, in addition to the following: 5.8.1.  Air  and  Space  Expeditionary  Forces  (AEF)/Expeditionary  Aerospace  Forces  (EAF) deployments.  TOs ensure shipment documentation in support of AEF and EAF deployments, humanitarian support, exercises or other special projects contain, if applicable, the assigned Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) 9 series or AF project code and Emergency and Special Programs (ESP) code.  Annotate the assigned ESP code on all movement documents that obligate funds for the specific program (e.g. ESP:***).  Current FY ESP codes are on the SAF/FMB website.  Access the Air Force Portal and search on SAF/FMB ESP codes. The base or MAJCOM will fund exercise deployment/redeployment that is not in direct support of a JCS project code. (T-1). 5.8.2.  Process  Exceptions  for  Personal  Property  (Household  Goods,  Unaccompanied Baggage), Materiel Movement, Local Purchase and GPC within the DTS.  The majority of AF sponsored  personal  property  and  materiel  movements  within  the  DTS  are  charged  to  the funding  appropriation  and/or  TAC  cited  on  the  TDY/PCS  order  or  to  the  TAC  on  the  base supply document. Certain authorized DTS movements must be paid from the unit/base O&M funds requiring the establishment of a TAC. (T-1).  These shipments include return of excess household goods to non-temporary storage in the CONUS in conjunction with assignment to government  quarters,  micro-purchases  made  through  the  GPC  program,  and  materiel movement when normal TACs do not apply.  For these shipments, the following applies: 5.8.2.1.  When personal property, materiel, local purchase, and GPC shipments are entitled to move in the DTS, but are funded by unit/base O&M funds, a TAC chargeable to the O&M  funds  must  be  established  prior  to  using  AMC,  MSC,  or  SDDC  services.  (T-1).  O&M funds used to pay for purchase card shipments expire on 30 Sep of each FY.  Unless current FY funding is provided, TACs are available in TGET until after 30 Sep. 5.8.2.2.  Purchase card users should be made aware that if a shipment changes mode from 30  Sep  to  1  Oct,  the  previous  year’s  FY  funds  would  cease  on  30  Sep.    Example:  If shipment arrives at POE on 30 Sep, but does not depart the POE until 1 Oct, the new FY money will have to be in place or the shipment will be frustrated at the port until TAC or SDN is reallocated for the new FY. (T-1). 5.8.3.  Security Cooperation Program (SCP)/Foreign Military Sales (FMS) TAC. Direct any financial  questions, to AFLCMC/WFCA, (937) 656-2712/2708, DSN 986-2712/2708, or e-mail. including  TAC  assignment  for  SCP  or  FMS  shipments, AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 57 Chapter 6 THIRD PARTY PAYMENT SYSTEM (TPPS) 6.1.  General.  AF TPPS Sites provide transportation payment support to geographically separated units  and  base  tenants  who  require  transportation  services  and  comply  with  the  provisions indicated  in  DTR  Part  II,  Chapter  212,  Payment  System,  and  DoD  7000.14-R,  Department  of Defense  Financial  Management  Regulation  (DoD  FMR),  Volume  10,  Chapter  13,  except  as indicated in this chapter. (T-0).  AF shipping activities are responsible for ensuring that proper funding lines are utilized, monthly invoices are paid within Prompt Payment Act  requirements, and that proper follow-up is exercised to eliminate rolling balances. (T-0).  6.2.  TPPS  Payment  Process.  The  commercial  TSP  business  rules  contain  the  following functions in the payment process. 6.2.1.  The  shipping  TO  or  designated  representative  enters  shipment  data  into  CMOS.    If CMOS is unavailable, manually create a shipment order/invoice/Buyer Document and enter the data directly into TPPS via the website.  If manually inputting a buyer invoice into TPPS, shippers must ensure that the Chart of Accounts (COA) reflects the proper funding reference for the shipment. (T-1). 6.2.2.  If a TSP’s software or waybill is used to create the movement document, the carrier pro-waybill number (PRO) or Tracking Number assigned by the TSP is inputted into TPPS and used  as  the  Buyer  Document  Identification  Number.    For  assistance  with  the  creation  of  a shipment Support customer.support@syncada.com or AFMC/A4RT. (T-0). TPPS/Syncada order/invoice, Customer contact 6.2.3.  The release of the electronic shipment order from CMOS ensures proper data transfer to  TPPS.    If  the  shipment  order  does  not  appear  in  TPPS,  query  the  TCN  or  Movement Document Number in Tracker Lite to ensure that the data transfer occurred.  If shipping via CMOS  I2P/OSI2P  Express  Ship,  check  for  breaks  in  the Pickup  Record  Number.    A  break signifies a file was not released out of CMOS successfully.  If there is a break in sequence, contact the Field Assistance Service (FAS) at DSN 596-5771, select options 1, 3, and 4. (T-0). 6.2.4.  Tracker  Lite automatically validates AF CMOS  shipment  funding prior to  posting in TPPS.  Sites  will  obtain  Tracker  Lite  access  to  determine  appropriate  funding  during  the planning  process,  view  funding  changes  after  shipment  release,  and  verify  the  status  of transactions at TPPS. https://trackerlite.wpafb.af.mil/LTS/. Tracker passing Access Lite to (T-1).  6.3.  TSP Payment Approval 6.3.1.  Payment Requirements 6.3.1.1.  Matching  Model  or  Match-On-Pro  Model  describes  the  process  whereby  the shipping system utilized by the shipper allows a buyers’ order to be matched to the TSP invoice or seller document  in  TPPS.  This  model allows for auto  approval  and minimal manual intervention.  AF TPPS sites will utilize the Matching Business Model exclusively. (T-1).    Exceptions  may  be  granted  based  on  mission  requirements  and  approved  by AFMC/A4RT. (T-1). 58 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 6.3.1.2.  TOs may request a change to the price threshold based upon workload and TSP characteristics  to  AFMC/A4RT.    Trading  Partner  Relationships  (TPRs)  thresholds  and tolerances is  set,  at  a minimum,  to  TL and  LTL  $10,000/$50  and small package carrier $1,000/$1  to  maximize  auto  approval.    This,  along  with  the  matching  business  model, ensure that 10% of the transactions remain for accomplishing manual audits.  AFMC/A4RT approves adjustments to site thresholds and tolerances, as required. (T-1). 6.3.2.  GPC  Payments  for  small  package  carrier  shipments.    Cardholders  are  required  to coordinate with their TO prior to setting up a TSP account.  Cardholders are required to obtain a Merchant Authorization Code from the Base Contracting Officer (GPC Program Manager) prior  to  using  a  GPC  for  small  package  carrier  shipments.    TOs  will  provide  advice  to cardholders when requested.  (T-1).  SDT CMA and TWCF funding will not  be utilized for GPC shipment charges. (T-1).  Units are billed the higher commercial rate when purchase card is used without first setting up an account.  TOs ensure they obtain a copy of the small package carrier  TSP(s)  reference  guide  that  provides  added  guidance  from  the  DoD  small  package carrier  website.    Refer  to  AFI  64-117,  Air  Force  Government  Wide  Purchase  Card  (GPC) Program. (T-1). 6.4.  TPPS Invoice Certification. 6.4.1.  The  LRS/APS  commander  is  the  designated  appointing  authority  for  the  Certifying Official.  The appointment must be in writing and a copy of the appointment letter, along with the DD Form 577, Signature Card, must be on file with the DFAS  Indianapolis Disbursing Office. (T-0).  ANG Certifiers are appointed by the USPFO or designated representative IAW NGR 130-6/ANG 36-1 Paragraph 2.8 and also adhere to the requirements imposed by their State USPFO.

The  ACA  is  the  official  clearance agency for shipments planned for airlift on military owned or controlled assets and coordinates movement to the Aerial Port of Embarkation (APOE) with both shippers and project managers.  The ACA is responsible to maintain visibility over cleared cargo and provides shipment status to tracer  requests.    In  addition,  the  ACA  works  with  APOEs  and  shippers  to  ensure  advance movement data is at the ports prior to arrival of materiel; they monitor and minimize delivery of cargo without proper clearance.  The ACA reviews documentation for accuracy and completeness prior to clearing material to facilitate cargo movement through the DTS.  As required, the ACA diverts, expedites, holds, and/or provides visibility for any mission critical cargo.  Refer to DTR, Part II, Appendix R, for CONUS ACA contact information and to identify applicable OCONUS ACA support. Us the AMC Air Channel Sequence Listing to identify APOEs. 7.2.  Air Force Eligibility and Challenge Procedures.  For current guidance on airlift eligibility and challenge procedures, see 635th SCOW SharePoint®. 7.2.1.  References. 7.2.1.1.  DoDM 4140.01, DoD Supply Chain Materiel Management Procedures. 7.2.1.2.  DTR 4500.9 R, Part II, Cargo Movement. 7.2.1.3.  AFI 23-101, Air Force Materiel Management, Chp 5. 7.2.2.  Airlift Eligibility.  Only TP-1 shipments with a valid Required Delivery Date (RDD) to include a blank RDD and TP-2 shipments with a valid RDD, as shown in Table 2.1., are airlift eligible.  TP-3  is  not  eligible  for  air  movement.  Divert  ineligible  TP-3  shipments  to  surface mode. However, certain medical and short shelf life items may move by air as TP-3, only if they have a valid RDD and/or project code. See Table 2.1., Transportation Priorities. 7.2.3.  Challenge Criteria. 7.2.3.1.  RDD 999.  Commanders will approve, or delegate in writing, personnel authorized to approve all 999 shipment requests. (T-1).  The Air Force ACA challenges commodities that do not meet the RDD of 999 requirements listed in table 7.1. 7.2.3.2.  ACA  informs  the  shipper  and  challenges  cargo  when  these  commodities  are offered  as  RDD  999.    The  requisitioner/shipper  provides  the  appropriate  authority’s (Squadron Commander level or equivalent) written approval to support assignment of RDD 999. 7.2.3.3.  Commodities listed in Table 7.1 do not routinely meet the requirements for AF sponsored shipments  with  an RDD of 999.  (T-1).  The shipper must consider challenge criteria before offering a shipment for movement. (T-2). AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 61 Table 7.1.  Challenge Commodities  7.2.3.4.  The requisitioner/shipper has the option to substantiate air transport at the time of initial request to the ACA.  The requisitioner/shipper should contact the ACA via e-mail or phone with airlift justification to prevent delay of urgently required cargo.  Shipments that are not justified as RDD 999 will be downgraded as appropriate. (T-1). 7.2.3.5.  Air Force funded Second Destination Transportation (SDT)/Centrally Managed Account (CMA) (TAC = F_ _ _) and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) funded (TAC = S_ _ _) shipments assigned a TP-1 with any RDD other than 999 or TP-2 with any RDD are challenged when the shipment exceeds 1,000 pounds or 250 cube. 7.2.3.6.  TP-2 shipments with blank RDD are not eligible for airlift.  Divert ineligible TP-2 shipments to surface mode. 7.2.3.7.  With the exception of short expiration date items, divert TP-3 shipments offered for  airlift  to  surface  movement.    See  AF  Service  criteria  posted  on  635th  SCOW SharePoint®.   However, TP-3 shipments may move as deferred airfreight (TP-4), upon approval  by  Air  Force  ACA  (see  paragraph  7.2.5)  in  coordination  with  the  applicable APOE Terminal Manager. 7.2.3.8.  Project Code Cargo is subject to ACA challenge/hold action to preclude misuse of project codes.  Based on hold findings, the ACA authorizes (total or partial) airlift or can direct shipment diversion to surface. 7.2.4.  Exemptions.  TP-1 and TP-2 shipments with one of the characteristics listed below are all airlift eligible and exempt from airlift challenge action: 62 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 7.2.4.1.  Aircraft Engines and Built Up Propellers (BUP). 7.2.4.2.  Foreign Military Sales (FMS):   If the delivery term code (DTC),  located at  the fifth position of the TCN, is 7, 9, A, D, F, G, or J. 7.2.4.3.  Shipments  with  short  expiration  date  (whole  blood,  perishable  subsistence, biological, batteries, required refrigeration, radioactive, etc.). 7.2.4.4.  AMC Support Shipments (TAC QMRS). 7.2.4.5.  Forward Supply System (FSS). 7.2.4.6.  TACs beginning with H, T and X. 7.2.4.7.  Courier and Classified Shipments. 7.2.4.8.  Code J Baggage. 7.2.4.9.  Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM) cargo.  All SAAM cargo shipments submitted for air clearance require a validated SAAM mission number in the DI T_9 trailer data to substantiate the clearance request and any subsequent use of the FSAM TAC.  Note: All air challenge exempt items must be properly prepared and documented for military air movement  to  include  cargo  requiring  special  packaging  and  or  hazardous  cargo considerations. (T-1).  With the exception of SAAM cargo, prepare ATCMDs for the above exemptions and advance into a transportation shipping system to expedite the flow of cargo through the DTS and provide ITV. 7.2.5.  Deferred  Air  Freight  (TP-4).    This  allows  non-air  eligible  cargo  (TP-3)  to  move  at surface rates in an uncommitted aircraft capacity.  Air terminal managers in coordination with the ACA determine the actual amount of TP-4 accepted into the aerial ports.  Shippers clear TP-4 cargo through the ACA prior to movement to the APOE. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 63 Chapter 8 AIR FORCE PACKAGING 8.1.  Packaging Guidance. 8.1.1.  Military Packaging.  Packaging is essential for effective military logistics support.  To be serviceable when needed, supplies and equipment procured to support military actions must be protected from damage and deterioration. (T-1). 8.1.2.  Uniform  Requirements  and  Procedures.   Joint  Service  Publication  AR  700 15/NAVSUPINST 4030.28D/AFMAN 24-206/MCO 4030.33D/DLAI 4145.7,  Packaging  of Materiel,  establishes  uniform  requirements  and  procedures  for  packaging  DoD  materiel acquired, stored, or shipped. 8.2.  AF Packaging.  TOs will execute AF packaging IAW AFMAN 24-206 and this AFI. (T-1). 8.2.1.  Levels of Protection.  The DoD has established two levels of military packing: Level A and  Level  B.  Level  A  provides  the  protection  required  to  meet  the  most  severe  worldwide shipment, handling, and storage conditions.  Level B provides the protection required to meet moderate worldwide shipment, handling, and storage conditions.  Refer to MIL-STD-2073-1 and  AFMAN  24-206  for  further  guidance  and  criteria  for  levels  of  protection.    Table  A4.1 provides common application of levels of protection.  AF shipping activities must comply with levels of protection and preservation requirements prescribed in SPIs. (T-1). 8.2.2.  Use of Existing Packaging Requirements.  If adequate military packaging requirements have  already  been  developed  for  the  item,  those  requirements  prevail.  Refer  to  MIL-STD-2073-1, Appendix A, and paragraph 8.4.2 herein. 8.2.3.  Commercial packaging is  IAW American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D3951, Standard Practice for Commercial Packaging.  Use and compatibility is IAW DoDM 4140.01-V9 and AFMAN 24-206.  Commercial Packaging is intended primarily for shipments that are used immediately at the first destination.  When MIL-STD-2073-1 requires the use of military packaging, commercial packaging must not be used. (T-0). 8.3.  Packaging  Operations.  The  size  and  mission  of  the  installation  determines  the  space required for the packing and crating facility.  The types, kinds and amounts of packaging material and  equipment  needed  vary  based  on  the  volume  and  characteristics  of  cargo  shipped.    When establishing packaging operations, locate packaging areas near the shipping or supply processing area. 8.3.1.  Facilities.  Each activity must have the basic facilities and equipment to package items that  are  opened  for  periodic  inspections;  received  inadequately  packaged  for  storage;  and shipped off-base, including redistribution or return of declared excesses and return of reparable items to the ALC depot or TRC. (T-1). 8.3.2.  Authorization  of  Equipment.    Allowance  Standard  874,  part  C,  provides  cleaning, drying, preserving, packing, and marking equipment authorized for base packaging facilities. 8.3.3.  Packaging Line Layout.  Materiel flows from work station to work station according to the  sequence  of  packaging  operations,  regardless  of  the  size  of  the  operation.    For  greatest production and efficiency, establish areas for each the following: 64 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 8.3.3.1.  An area for receiving, inspecting, and identifying material. 8.3.3.2.  An administrative and work-process planning area for reference materials,  such as T.O.s, SPIs, standards, specifications, and related transportation publications. 8.3.3.3.  A material storage and supply area for maintaining bench stock preservative and packaging supplies, and recycled containers (other than unit stored reusable containers). 8.3.3.4.  An industrial equipment area for cutting materials to size, fabricating bags, boxes, and crates, printing labels and tags, and for feeding supplies, such as tapes and adhesives into the packaging line. 8.3.3.5.  A cleaning, drying, and preserving area. 8.3.3.6.  A unit packing area large enough to handle variable workloads. 8.3.3.7.  An area for containerizing and packing oversized materiel that cannot be handled in  the  unit  packing  area.    This  area  must  contain,  or  be  located  near,  the  woodworking machinery and be accessible to mechanized Materials Handling Equipment (MHE). (T-2). 8.3.3.8.  At least one electrostatic discharge (ESD) protective work station where trained personnel  package  sensitive  (ESDS)  items.    The  work  station  must  include  a  static dissipative work surface and personnel grounding devices. (T-1).  Refer to T.O. 00-25-234, General  Shop  Practice  Requirements  for  Repair,  Maintenance,  and  Test  of  Electronic Equipment,  for  detailed  information  about  ESD  protective  work  stations.    Post  signs prohibiting  entry  of  unauthorized  personnel  and  static-producing  materials  in  areas designated for packaging ESDS items. 8.3.3.9.  A  staging  area  or  areas  where  hazardous  materials  are  segregated  and  stored pending shipment, if necessary, as determined by 49 CFR. 8.3.4.  Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and AFI Standards.  Packaging facilities must  have  adequate  space  to  accommodate  the  requirements  in  paragraph  8.3.3  and  still maintain  a  safe,  clean  and  orderly  work  area.    Ensure  that  health  and  safety  standards  are consistent with OSHA and AFIs when planning the type and layout of facilities and equipment. (T-1).  Refer to AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction. 8.4.  Packaging Cost Control. 8.4.1.  Local  Purchase  Items.   As a rule, local  purchase  (LP) items  bought  at  base level  are intended  for  immediate  use.    In  most  cases,  the  standard  packaging  of  the  vendor  or manufacturer  adequately  protects  items;  this  packaging  may  be  used  if  it  meets  49  CFR requirements and safety standards.  Purchasing documents for LP materiel must contain the statement: “Military packaging is not required.  The packaging provided must protect the item to  its  destination  and  conform  to  applicable  DOT  or  intrastate  regulations.”  (T-1).    This statement permits rejection of substandard packaging at delivery based on DOT regulations. 8.4.2.  AF requisitioners initiating a buy for an item with an assigned Item Manager (IM) will obtain  packaging  requirements  applicable  to  the  item  from  the  managing  AFSC  packaging office. For items without an assigned IM, contact the AFSC packaging office, if needed, in determining specific packaging requirements. (T-1) AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 65 8.4.3.  Packaging Economy.   Proper packaging and use of economical packaging techniques allow  significant  savings  of  O&M  funds  while  minimizing  the  creation  of  solid  waste.  Examples of areas where economies and improvements can be realized include: 8.4.3.1.  Reclaiming and reusing containers and packaging materials. 8.4.3.2.  Keeping specially designed packs for reshipment or return of items to the using or repair activity. 8.4.3.3.  Using  a  GSA  stock  list  to  compare  costs  of  multiple  materials  with interchangeable functionality.  Substitute high cost materials with less expensive one when possible. Visit https://www.gsaadvantage.com. 8.4.3.4.  Standardizing the number and types of packaging materials purchased. 8.4.3.5.  Ensuring that units use materiel for its intended purpose, such as MIL-PRF-131, Barrier Materials, Watervaporproof, Greaseproof, Flexible, Heat Sealable, be used if the pack is to be heat-sealed; but using it becomes wasteful if other than a watervaporproof enclosure is required. 8.4.3.6.  Anticipating  both  periodic  near  and  long  term  requirements  for  reusable containers and packaging materials so units can purchase them in larger, more economical quantities. 8.4.3.7.  Using  the  lowest  acceptable  levels  of  preservation  and  packing  to  meet  the anticipated logistics cycle. 8.5.  Preserving and Packing Items of Supply and Equipment.  Development of preservation and packing requirements must conform to criteria specified in MIL-STD-2073-1, AFMAN 24-206, and this AFI. (T-0). 8.5.1.  Preserving  Supply  and  Equipment  Items.    Packaging  must  prevent  damage  to  items during issue or transfer. (T-1).  If not protected, supply items and equipment can deteriorate during the distribution, storage, and issue cycle.  Items placed in storage or shipped to another activity must be preserved to prevent deterioration from corrosion, mildew, decay, mold, and from attack from microorganisms, or vermin. (T-2). The shipper, or other persons, offering an item  for  shipment  or  storage  must  ensure  the  article  is  as  clean  and  dry  as  possible  before offering it for preservation. (T-2). 8.5.1.1.  Selecting  the  Method  of  Preservation.    An  item’s  physical  and  chemical characteristics determine the method of preservation.  When a SPI or T.O. prescribes the method of preserving a particular item or group of items, that requirement takes precedence over general guidelines.  When specific instructions are not provided, use tables in MIL-STD-2073-1 to select the method of preservation and the container, or contact the AFSC packaging office that manages the item for assistance. 8.5.1.2.  Preserving Items for Shipment or Storage.  When preserving items for shipment or storage: 8.5.1.2.1.  Clean  and  dry  all  items  before  applying  preservation.  Use  a  cleaning  or drying method that do not harm the item. 8.5.1.2.2.  Use a preservative, when required, that does not harm the item. For example, petroleum-based preservatives should not be used on rubber or fabric products. 66 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 8.5.1.2.3.  Properly wrap, cushion, block, or brace the item in the unit container. 8.5.1.2.4.  Ensure  any  materials  used  in  cleaning,  drying,  preserving,  wrapping, cushioning, and packing are clean and free from defects. 8.5.1.2.5.  Use an overwrap of appropriate conforming barrier material if item exposure directly to precipitation is anticipated; otherwise, any other usual method of supplying physical protection should be sufficient. 8.5.2.  Packing  Items.    Improper  packing  and  handling  causes  the  most  damage  during transportation.    The  importance  of  selecting  the  proper  containers  and  using  the  proper cushioning,  blocking,  and  bracing  cannot  be  overemphasized.    Care  in  handling  is  equally important. 8.5.2.1.  Guidance  Sources  for  Packing.    A  SPI,  T.O.,  or  other  service/agency-approved document or drawing, or both, takes priority over general instructions. In case SPI and T.O. guidance  differ,  SPI  requirements  take  precedence  over  T.O.  or  other  documents.    The managing AFSC packaging specialist formally coordinates with the responsible equipment specialist  and  reviews  weapon  system  specific  SPIs  and  T.O.s,  as  applicable.    The packaging  specialist,  equipment  specialist,  and  T.O.  manager  coordinates  necessary actions to ensure the SPIs and T.O.s are congruent with respect to Packaging, Handling, Storage & Transportation (PHS&T) requirements. (T-1)  If a SPI or T.O. does not provide specific guidance, use: 8.5.2.1.1.  MIL-STD-2073-1 to identify and select the unit and intermediate containers, preservation, wrap, cushioning, and dunnage requirements. 8.5.2.1.2.  T.O.  00-85  series.    These  documents  provide  graphic  details  on  how  to determine the correct packaging required. 8.5.2.2.  How to  Pack. Single items  are packed  according to  the applicable T.O. or SPI.  When consolidating two or more packed line items in a single container, place the heaviest or most dense items at the bottom of the container.  Avoid packing light, fragile items with heavy, rugged items in the same pack.  Arrange contents of the pack to provide greatest protection to interior packages. 8.6.  Packaging  Reparable  Items.  Reparable  items  require  adequate  protection  to  prevent damage or deterioration during intra-base handling and item return shipments.  Reparable items must be packed according to the applicable T.O. or SPI. (T-1).  Damage incurred from improper packing and preservation may increase repair costs, processing time, and could lead to the item being condemned.  During intra-base movements, items are transported in their specified SPI pack or equivalent handling device.  Examples of equivalent handling devices include transport trailers for aircraft propellers, saddles for wing sections, and cradles for fuel tanks. 8.7.  Packaging  Retrograde  or  Return  Shipments.  To  prevent  deterioration  and  damage, serviceable and unserviceable returns are protected IAW AFMAN 24-206.  Cushion, block, and brace each reparable return in individual packs.  Use the replacement part package to repackage the reparable item for return shipment. If a SPI or T.O. contains packaging instructions, comply with the applicable document. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 67 8.8.  Obtaining Assistance When a SPI Container Is Not Available.  If a SPI container cannot be fabricated at the base or a SPI container is not available, for example, new items, lost, damaged, due-in from maintenance (Credit DIFM), take one of these actions in this order: the  AF  Reusable  Container  Worldwide  Warehouse at 8.8.1.  Use https://spires.wpafb.af.mil,  to  acquire  the  required  SPI  container  as  a  lateral  support  asset from bases within the same command or the same overseas theater. (RECON) 8.8.2.  Obtain a SPI waiver from the AFSC packaging office or Contractor Supported Weapon System  (CSWS)  Source  of  Supply  (SOS)  that  manages  the  item  authorizing  the  use  of  a suitable  replacement.  Request  a  deviation  number  for  alternate  containers  and  applicable instructions. See paragraph 8.9. 8.8.3.  Purchase locally the services/materials needed to fabricate the approved SPI container.  Use AF Form 451 when fabricating SPI containers, as outlined in Attachment 5. 8.8.4.  Submit a supply requisition via normal base supply channels to the managing ALC IM for  stock  numbered  SPI  containers.    Normally,  users  submit  supply  requisitions  for  stock numbered  SPI  containers.    Supply  requisitions  are  not  used  for  non-stock  numbered  SPI containers.  For non-stock numbered containers, contact the managing AFSC packaging office for  lateral  support.  See  paragraph  8.9.2  for  contact  information.    For  each  container,  the following information is required: 8.8.4.1.  SPI Number. 8.8.4.2.  Quantity. 8.8.4.3.  Item National Stock Number (NSN). 8.8.4.4.  Ship to address. 8.8.4.5.  Fund Cite. 8.8.4.6.  Intended use (shipment or storage). 8.8.4.7.  Point of contact. 8.8.4.8.  DSN number. 8.8.4.9.  Any other applicable information. 8.8.5.  Contact  AFPTEF  and  request  packaging  services  to  fabricate  the  necessary  SPI container.  AFPTEF contact information is: AFLCMC/EZPAA, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, phone (937) 257-3362, DSN 787-3362, http://www.wpafb.af.mil/units/afptef/. 8.8.6.  The requesting activity is responsible for all materials, as well as transportation costs for ALC or AFPTEF fabricated containers and/or the total contract cost associated with the fabrication. 8.9.  Authorized Deviations. 8.9.1.  SPI Waivers.  The managing packaging office or CSWS SOS is the exception authority for SPI waivers. SPI waivers should only be submitted when urgent  or immediate action is required.  Contact  the  managing  packaging  office  or  CSWS  SOS  and  request  a  deviation number  be  provided.  Mark  the  deviation  number  on  the  lower  right  hand  portion  of  the 68 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 identification  side  of  the  container  prior  to  movement.  Ensure  the  deviation  number  is annotated on all shipping documents. 8.9.2.  SPIRES  provides  the  managing  packaging  office  for  requesting  SPI  waivers.    The packaging specialist and contact information is listed by FSC and MMAC.  Table 8.1. lists the responsible packaging office by Routing Identifier Code (RIC). Table 8.1.  Packaging Office by RIC 8.9.3.  Fast  Pack  Deviations.    See  T.O.  00-85B-3,  How  To  Package  Air  Force  Spares, Paragraph 3.1.10, for specific guidance. 8.10.  Special  Procedures.  This  section  contains  special  procedures  that  differ  from,  or  are  in addition to, the usual packaging requirements of materiel.  8.10.1.  Hazardous Materials, Hazardous Wastes, and Regulated Articles.  Ensure hazardous materials,  hazardous  wastes,  and  regulated  articles  are  properly  prepared  for  shipment according  to  the  applicable  directives  governing  the  mode  of  transportation.  See  paragraph 2.16.6. 8.10.2.  ESD  Sensitive  Items.    Always  handle  ESD  sensitive  items  with  their  protective packaging materials except at a grounded ESD workstation.  ESD sensitive items, regardless of their condition,  must be packaged in  ESD protective materials  to  counteract  electrostatic and electromagnetic forces. (T-2).  Packaging requirements for ESD sensitive depot reparable items  are  specified  in  SPIs.    ESD  sensitive  items  are  preserved  IAW  MIL-STD-2073-1, paragraph  5.2.4.1,  unless  otherwise  specified.    T.O.  00-25-234,  Section  VII,  Electrostatic Discharge  Control,  provides  specific  guidelines  for  ESD  control  measures.    For  complete system  “Black  Box”  items,  follow  guidance  specified  in  T.O.  00-25-234,  Section  VII, Paragraph 7-4.a.(3). 8.10.2.1.  Identify ESD items by Type Cargo Code “3” on the DD Form 1348-1A, and by special  interior  and  exterior  markings.    Markings  should  include  the  yellow  sensitive-electronic-device caution label or symbol.  The seventh position of fast pack and standard pack SPI numbers is the method of preservation code 9.  For example, a SPI number of F000009XC5 identifies  ESD preservation is  required.  Code 9 items  must use antistatic cushioning and wrapping. (T-1).  Refer to T.O. 00-85B-3. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 69 8.10.2.2.  Use caution if required to open ESD items.  Conserve the ESD bags because they are usually constructed with enough extra material to allow for at least one additional heat seal, thereby facilitating reuse in the maintenance activity. 8.10.3.  Security  Assistance  such  as  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS)  and  Military  Assistance Program  (MAP).    Security  Assistance  items,  including  FMS,  are  especially  susceptible  to damage  due  to  unknown  and  unfavorable  transportation,  climatic,  and  storage  conditions. Provide Level B packing IAW MIL-STD-2073-1, unless otherwise directed by the procuring country. 8.10.4.  Serviceable KC-46 Parts.   To prevent shipment delays, a FAA Form 8130-3 or EASA Form One (used by European Union member countries), must accompany any serviceable KC-46 part when it is received, issued or shipped. (T-1).  Those forms are included in the container with the part and used to validate the airworthiness approval certification of the part. 8.10.5.  Small Arms, Other Weapons, and NWRM. See Chapter 4. 8.10.6.  Protecting Product Quality Deficiency Report (PQDR) Metallurgical Failure Exhibits.  Exhibits  comprised  of  failed  metallurgical  parts  receive  exceptional  care  in  packaging  and handling  to  preserve  failure  evidence.  DD  Form  2332,  Product  Quality  Deficiency  Report Exhibit,  must  accompany  any  exhibits.  (T-1).    Packaging  and  handling  must  not  prevent accurate metallurgical failure analysis. The following rules apply: 8.10.6.1.  Do  not  clean  or  apply  acid  to  the  fracture  except  for  exhibits  shipped  from overseas.   Clean exhibits  from  overseas activities only when necessary to satisfy public health  requirements.  (T-2).    Take  care  to  prevent  damage  to  evidence  during  cleaning.  Foreign products on the fracture may aid analysis. 8.10.6.2.  Do not touch the fracture face with fingers, tools, or instruments. 8.10.6.3.  Protect the fracture face from the environment, particularly where corrosion can occur.    Do  not  apply  preservatives  to  the  fracture  face  as  they  could  interfere  with  the analysis process. 8.10.6.4.  Store the item in a desiccated, watervaporproof bag, fabricated from MIL PRF 131  barrier  material  or  equivalent.    Seal  the  bag  airtight.    Include  one  item  for  each watervaporproof bag. 8.10.6.5.  If the exhibit is shipped intact rather than in parts, ship only the exhibit in the container.  Do not disassemble or otherwise compromise the exhibit unit. 8.10.6.6.  If the item is bent or broken, use a shipping container large enough to prevent rearranging or disturbing the bent or broken area. 8.10.6.7.  Pack  items  in  a  manner  that  prevents  damage  during  shipment  to  exhibit evidence.  If more than one exhibit is packed in a single container, make sure each exhibit is individually packaged, and that cushioning or wrap is used to prevent contact between each  exhibit.    Refer  to  T.O.  00-35D-54,  USAF  Deficiency  Reporting  and  Investigating System,  for  further  guidance  on  protecting  metallurgical  failure  exhibits  and  marking material deficiency report exhibits. 8.10.7.  War  Reserve  Materiel  (WRM)  and  items  in  Readiness  Spares  Packages  (RSP)  and Kits: 70 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 8.10.7.1.  Give War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Level A or Level B packing accordingly, unless  otherwise  specified  by  the  AFSC  packaging  office.    See  Attachment  4.    These requirements  or  those  specified  by  the  AFSC  packaging  office  apply  even  when  the packaging activity packs the items for deployment within kits or mobility bins. 8.10.7.2.  Depot reparable WRM must be kept in complete SPI packs to ensure protection during deployment and to provide packs for return of reparable items from deployed sites. (T-1). 8.10.7.3.  Do not stock packaging materials as WRM, unless otherwise specified by Unit Type Codes (UTCs). 8.10.7.4.  Overseas  bases  may  maintain  as  much  as  a  90-day  level  of  bench  stock  of packaging materials, based on current usage.  Each base must maintain at least a 30-day level of bench stock of packaging materials. (T-1) 8.10.8.  Uncrated Shipments.  Crate items in a manner that aids handling and protecting the item.    A  qualified  TSP  certified  to  transport  uncrated  items  may  ship  uncrated  large  items requiring  special  handling.    Obtain  lists  of  qualified  TSPs  from  SDDC  Freight  Routing Department.  Activities may load other packaged items in a vehicle partly filled with uncrated items if those items are blocked and braced. 8.10.9.  Criteria for Large Items.  Unless restricted by SPI or requirements for palletized unit loads,  activities  may  ship  large  items  without  crates  as  uncrated  when  all  of  the  following criteria are met: 8.10.9.1.  The  cost  of  packaging  and  shipping  by  other  means  would  cost  more  than shipping the item uncrated. 8.10.9.2.  The  item  is  capable  of  withstanding  shipment  uncrated.    Any  part  highly susceptible to damage must be removed from the major component and packaged properly. (T-2).  Then firmly attach the parts to the unit being shipped before releasing it to the TSP. 8.10.9.3.  Qualified TSPs are available to handle the shipment. 8.10.9.4.  The item does not have a security classification that requires packing or crating to prevent disclosure to unauthorized personnel. 8.10.9.5.  The  item  is  not  hazardous  cargo  as  classified  by  AFMAN  24-204,  49  CFR, IATA, or other Federal regulatory policy. 8.10.9.6.  Not otherwise prohibited by DTR, Part II or SDDC guidance. 8.11.  Unitized Loads.  When practical, AF cargo must be unitized at the source of shipment. (T-2).  Unitizing compatible items provides greater efficiency and economy in handling, transporting, and documenting cargo by reducing the number of containers needed to be individually handled.  Properly unitized loads reduce incidents of damage, loss, and pilferage.  The unitization policies in this section do not apply to materials regulated by AFMAN 24-204.  Unitization is practiced by two basic methods: palletization and consolidation. 8.11.1.  Palletization.  AF shippers must build unitized loads in accordance with MIL-STD-147, Palletized Unit Loads. (T-0).  For loading 463L pallets, Refer to T.O. 35D33-2-2-2, 463L Air Cargo Pallets, Types HCU-6/E and HCU-12/,E. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 71 8.11.2.  Consolidation.   In compliance with  DTR Part  II, consolidate shipments for a single consignee  overseas,  or  when  advantageous,  to  several  consignees  within  CONUS.    These shipments must have compatible commodity freight rates, materiel characteristics, and density. (T-1).  The consolidation container must adequately protect contents during shipment. (T-1). Consolidation must not be used to prevent unit packaging. (T-0).  Refer to MIL-STD-2073-1 for  guidance  in  selecting  a  consolidation  container.    To  obtain  maximum  advantages  of consolidation: 8.11.2.1.  Restrict total weight and the cubic measurements of the contents so they do not exceed the limit prescribed for the container selected. 8.11.2.2.  Assemble loose items or small unit packs of the same stock number into a single unit by bagging, bundling, tying, wrapping, cartonizing, and identifying contents according to MIL-STD-129 before placing them in the container. 8.11.2.3.  Facilitate mechanical handling by using skids on containers for the following: (1)  containers  with  a  gross  weight  more  than  200  pounds  (90.71  kilograms)  and  (2) containers exceeding length  and width dimensions of 48 by 24 inches (121.92 by 60.96  centimeters) with a gross weight more than 100 pounds (45.35 kilograms).  Use a pallet base  rather  than  a  skid  for  consolidation  containers  with  a  gross  weight  of  250  pounds (113.39 kilograms) or more or have a gross cube of 20 cubic feet (0.57 cubic meters) or more. 8.11.2.4.  Pack  serviceable  and  unserviceable  materiel  separately.    To  meet  the  level  of packing required for the individual item, package items individually.  If a line item does not have packaging data available, contact  the AFSC packaging office that manages the item for guidance.  Keep the center of gravity low by placing heavy, dense items at the bottom  of  the  container,  blocked  and  braced  to  prevent  shifting.    Fill  voids  to  prevent shifting of contents.  Use excess, reclaimed cushioning (fill), clean scrap, or other suitable material that has no other reuse value. 8.11.2.5.  Mark all consolidated shipping containers “MULTIPACK.”  Include the gross weight  and  any  additional  marks  as  noted  in  MIL-STD-129.    See  paragraph  8.12.2  for multipack marking requirements. 8.12.  Marking Materiel for Shipment and Storage. 8.12.1.  MIL-STD-129 establishes procedures for marking military supplies and equipment for shipment  and  storage.    Specifications,  T.O.s,  drawings,  and  SPIs  may  also  contain  special marking requirements.  The requirements are valid, and apply as specified.  Any surface must be  in  a  condition  so  that  markings  remain  permanent,  legible,  and  non-fading.  (T-1).    Old markings and labels not  applicable to the shipment must be obliterated. (T-1).  This  can be accomplished by blanking it out or covering the old marking or label with paint or stencil ink.  Do  not  cut  or  strip  old  labels  from  fiberboard  containers  as  this  can  destroy  the  corrugated flutes.  The destruction of the corrugated flutes reduces structural integrity of the box as well as serviceable life.  Except as provided for in this section, compliance with MIL-STD-129 is mandatory. 8.12.2.  Multipack Shipments.   MIL-STD-129 contains marking  requirements for multipack shipments  including  those  containing  shelf-life  or  warranty  items.    Multipacks  containing properly packaged ESD sensitive items do not require ESD markings on the exterior multipack 72 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 container.  If a consolidation container contains a unit container marked “FRAGILE,” do not put fragile labels on the consolidation container unless the gross weight of the consolidation container is 75 pounds (34.01 kilograms) or less. 8.12.3.  Expedite Shipment Marking.  The AF uses two codes to identify expedite shipments: Code 999 and NMCS.  Code 999 shipments take precedence over all other shipments.  While both  codes  can  apply  to  a  single  shipment,  do  not  apply  NMCS  markings  if  you  use  999 markings.  Mark each unit in the shipment. 8.12.3.1.  Expedite  Shipment  Marking  Label.    Shipping  documents  are  annotated  if  the shipments are a 999, or NMCS.  The 999 and NMCS labels are commercially sourced and no longer available through GSA.  Use the largest size that space permits.  Attach one label on the identification side next to the address label.  Place another label on the opposite side of the container.  Mark irregularly shaped units where shippers can easily see the markings. 8.12.4.  Project Code Markings.  Shipping documents identify whether an item has a project code.  Ensure it is printed on the shipping label. 8.12.5.  Fragile Markings.  When packaging completely conforms to specified AF packaging requirements, fragile markings are not required unless prescribed by a SPI.  When packaging does not completely conform to AF requirements for a specific item, the shipper must decide whether to use fragile markings. (T-2). 8.12.6.  Marking Component Parts of SPI Containers.  Component parts of SPI containers with complex configurations, such as die-cuts or special purpose inserts not secured in the container are kept together and marked with the SPI number. 8.12.6.1.  For  classified  shipments,  SPI  numbers  should  be  marked  on  the  inside  of  the container and not on the exterior. 8.12.6.2.  For hazardous material shipments, do not obliterate UN specification packaging markings from SPI containers. 8.12.6.3.  For  fast  pack  and  standard  pack  containers,  do  not  mark  SPI  numbers  on  the exterior of the containers or on their internal components. 8.12.7.  Top-heavy  Shipments.    To  determine  when  containers  or  crates  require  top-heavy marking (in addition to the center of balance requirements of MIL-STD-129): 8.12.7.1.  Containers  with  Uniform  Loads.    Locate  the  center  of  gravity  (CG)  of  a uniformly distributed load.  To determine the CG, locate the side with the smallest base dimension of either the width (W) or the length (L) of the crate (Figures 8.1 and 8.2).  When the base dimensions of either “W” or “L” are equal (Figure 8.1), either side can work.  On the  chosen  side,  draw  diagonal  lines  from  opposite  corners.    The  intersection  of  the diagonal lines is the CG of the load. 8.12.7.2.  Using the same base dimension used to find the load CG, draw an equilateral triangle on the crate.  If the CG is within the triangle (Figure 8.1), the container is within the safe limits for normal handling.  If the CG is not within the triangle (Figure 8.2), the crate is unsafe for normal handling and should be marked TOPHEAVY. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 73 Figure 8.1.  Uniform Load Figure 8.2.  Top-heavy Load   8.12.7.3.  Forklift Entry.  A captive forklift entry must be used on crates that are unsafe for normal handling, even when they are marked “TOPHEAVY.” (T-1). 8.12.7.4.  High Centers of Gravity.  For suspected loads that may have a normally high CG, such as machinery, drill presses, bandsaws, and wing sections, the CG may be obtained by turning the crate on its side and placing it over a pipe.  Roll the crate back and forth until you can balance it.  After the CG is found, mark the crate as “TOPHEAVY” if it meets the above criteria. 8.12.7.4.1.  When the height of the crate is equal to three times the shortest base, the crate must be marked “TOPHEAVY.” (T-1). 74 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 8.12.7.4.2.  When the height of the crate is over 48 inches and the CG is more than 24 inches above the base, the crate must be marked “TOPHEAVY.” (T-1). AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 75 Chapter 9 AF PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES FOR WOOD PACKAGING MATERIAL 9.1.  Phytosanitary  Requirements.  The  United  Nations  (UN)  International  Plant  Protection Convention (IPPC) imposed phytosanitary requirements that mitigate the risk of introduction and spread of quarantine pests associated with the movement in international trade of WPM made from raw wood. 9.1.1.  AF activities engaged in packaging of materiel shall comply with the requirements of DoD  4140.65-M,  Issue,  Use,  and  Disposal  of  Wood  Packaging  Material  (WPM),  which establishes guidance in compliance with International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures Number 15 (ISPM No. 15), Regulation of Wood Packaging Material in International Trade. (T-1).  WPM includes wood pallets, skids, load boards, pallet collars, crates, wooden boxes, reels,  dunnage,  frames,  and  cleats  composed  of  non-manufactured  wood.    Manufactured (processed) wood products are exempt, such as plywood, particleboard, oriented strand board, and  veneers.    WPM  made  of  exempt  materials  but  combined  with  solid  non-manufactured wood components must still be treated and marked.  (T-0). 9.1.2.  All AF activities responsible for procurement of preservation and packing requirements for contracts ensure WPM phytosanitary requirements are met in every solicitation for goods.  If  these  procedures  are  not  followed,  then  uncertified,  unmarked  or  improperly  marked materiel  will  become  frustrated  cargo  and  destroyed  at  the  port  of  debarkation,  or  require remediation and repacking at the aerial and water ports or Consolidation and Containerization Point (CCP); resulting in increased cost and time delays to the AF. (T-0). 9.2.  Certification  Markings.  Certification  markings  identify  compliant  WPM.    AF  activities must procure an ISPM 15 certification mark; an ISPM 15 certification mark applicable to dunnage; and a DoD Pest Free certification mark, and apply appropriate certification marking as required and defined in DoD 4140.65-M. (T-0).  9.2.1.  Certification  marking  stamps  can  be  custom  ordered  and  procured  at  local  printing shops; certifications must be indelible and permanent,  legible, and durable;  the color of the marking  ink  shall  be  black;  and  if  any  of  the  WPM  certification  marking  devices  becomes defective, such as illegible due to worn rubber, replace it. (T-0). 9.2.2.  Certification marking stamps must be stored in a secure cabinet.  Only personnel that have successfully completed the DoD WPM web-based training course in paragraph 9.4 may apply WPM certification markings. (T-0). 9.3.  Management Controls.  AF activities must report, audit, and enforce WPM standards and measures IAW DoD 4140.65-M. (T-0).  Each reporting activity must register the DoDAAC, site auditor,  and  site  custodian  in  the  DoD  WPM  website.  (T-0).    Installations  with  two  or  more packaging activities will have separate WPM certification marks as well as auditing and reporting requirements. (T-0). 9.3.1.  AF  activities  maintain  receipt,  lumber  usage,  certification  marking,  and  reporting documentation  for  compliance  purposes  throughout  the  process.    Each  certified  WPM  site retains records IAW AFRIMS 24 series, Transportation. WPM records, at a minimum, will contain the following documents: 76 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 9.3.1.1.  Purchase Order/Requisition/Receipts of Quantity of Heat Treated (HT) lumber or Kiln Dried/Heat Treated (KD/HT) lumber purchased. (T-1). 9.3.1.2.  Work order(s) or other documentation that identifies amount of board feet used. 9.3.1.3.  Usage of ISPM 15 and DoD Pest Free certification marking stamps. (T-1). 9.3.1.4.  Training certificates for any person authorized to use the ISPM 15 and DoD Pest Free certification stamps. (T-1). 9.3.2.  Monthly Reports.  Trained custodians must provide two monthly reports to  the DoD WPM website. (T-1).  Those reports are: (1) Lumber usage monthly report; and (2) DoD Pest Free monthly report.  In addition, the reports are posted to the DoD WPM website within 2 weeks of the end of the reported month.  If the DoD Pest Free stamp is not used, custodians will zero-out the numbers on the applicable DoD Pest Free monthly report. (T-0). 9.3.3.  On-site Audits.  AF WPM audits will be conducted using a combination of the DoD WPM  website  as  well  as  on-site  audits.    WPM  auditor(s)  will  not  be  assigned  to  the Deployment  and  Distribution  Flight  in  order  to  conduct  an  independent  and  impartial inspection.  Trained auditors must perform annual on-site audits for the previous calendar year. (T-0).  The results of those audits must be reported and posted on the DoD WPM website NLT 31 January of each year. (T-0).  The WPM Program Manager or AF Component Manager may direct additional WPM audits.  Refer to DoD 4140.65-M, or the DoD WPM website for the audit inspection checklist. (T-0). 9.3.4.  Consequences of Audit Failure or Noncompliance.  AF activities will receive warnings, suspensions, and withdrawal of American Lumber Standard Committee (ALSC) quality stamp marking privileges for audit failure or noncompliance.  When audit failures, noncompliance, or validated shipping discrepancies are reported, AF activities are required to implement the process specified in DoD 4140.65-M. (T-0). 9.4.  Training  Requirements.  Personnel  involved  in  audit  inspections,  custodian  reporting, remediation,  and  certification  marking  of  WPM,  must  successfully  complete  a  comprehensive DoD web-based training course on the WPM website. (T-1). The course provides self-certification qualification training.  Refresher training is required every 2 years.  AF activities must maintain printed training certificates at the activity level in the WPM records for verification during on-site audits. (T-0). AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 77 CHAPTER 10 AF REUSABLE CONTAINER PROGRAM 10.1.  General Information.  The AF RCP is designed to  control packaging costs and promote efficiencies  through  the  reuse  of  containers  to  the  greatest  extent  possible.    It  helps  ensure  the continuous flow of serviceable items by increasing the use of containers already in the DTS. It also provides management and control of reusable containers to minimize problems such as misuse, unnecessary procurement of new containers, failure to redistribute excess reusable containers as well as prevent premature disposal of these assets in solid waste streams. 10.1.1.  Many  items  can  be  reused  after  undergoing  calibration,  repair,  or  retrofitting,  but cannot be made serviceable by the using base.  Those items must be returned to the ALC depot or TRC. (T-1).  Items may include reparable and technical order compliance items. 10.1.2.  Intermodal containers are not managed under this program. See Chapter 12. 10.2.  Reusable Containers.  A reusable container is designed to be used, reclaimed, and reused as a complete system, with the possible exception of the wrap or barrier materials.  The interior packaging  materials  and  devices  (items  such  as  wrap,  barrier  material,  cushioning,  blocking, bracing,  or  fasteners)  are  as  essential  to  the  protective  functions  of  the  pack  as  the  exterior container. 10.2.1.  Guidelines for Serviceable Reusable Containers.  Personnel who handle, package, or store  reusable  containers  will  perform  a  visual  inspection  before  reuse  to  determine  the serviceability of reusable containers.  Damaged or missing components of the container system must be repaired or replaced before reuse. (T-1).  Dispose of unserviceable containers IAW local procedures.  At minimum, serviceable reusable containers must meet all the following requirements: (T-1). 10.2.1.1.  Protect serviceable items against natural and induced environments and physical damage.  Protect unserviceable items against further deterioration during return to the ALC depot or TRC. 10.2.1.2.  Be capable of being opened and closed without impairing the container's ability to provide its original level of protection. 10.2.1.3.  Endure the shipping, handling and storage environment for the number of trips required to yield the lowest total packaging, maintenance, storage, and transportation costs for the expected life cycle of the item it protects. 10.2.1.4.  Have  all  its  components  in  sound  condition  and  free  from  visible  defects  or damage to include, but not limited to, the following reusable containers: 10.2.1.4.1.  Fiberboard  containers  cannot  have  existing  tears/cuts,  holes,  pierces, punctures,  material  separation,  significant  peeling laminate (delamination), or show signs of crushing.  Containers must be in good, rigid condition with  flaps intact.  (T-1).  Further, the fiberboard  containers cannot  show  evidence of water  or  moisture  damage,  or  discoloration  that  may  indicate  exposure  to  liquids  or sunlight that has created structural weakening. the  moisture to 78 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 10.2.1.4.2.  Cleated wooden boxes and crates must be free of grease, oil, and water or moisture  damage.  (T-1).    Side,  end,  or  top  panels  must  not  show  evidence  of  ply separation, weather rotted lumber, or excessive warping that would significantly affect container structural integrity. (T-1).  All cleats must be attached. (T-1).  Nails must not protrude from lumber. (T-1).  Rotten, damaged, or broken lumber must be replaced. (T-1). 10.2.1.4.3.  Cylindrical containers will not have any separation at top or bottom seams.  Chimes (top or bottom rings), and metal lever locking rings will not show significant rusting/corrosion or have critical dents that would affect structural integrity.  Chimes should be unbent and firmly connected to, with no separation from, the container walls.  Metal lever locking rings should fit snug around the container and not be loose when closed.  Lids should be flat, with smooth edges that fit completely over the upper edge of  the  container.    Container  walls  will  not  show  any  signs  of  collapse,  crushing,  or weakening over the chimes.  Drums should not show signs of instability, unsteadiness, or wobbling. 10.2.1.5.  Have no excessive markings, labels, or obliteration spray paint which imposes risk for misidentification of items. 10.2.1.6.  If the serviceability of a particular container is in question, follow the procedures in paragraph 8.8, or contact the AFSC packaging office that manages the item for specific guidance. 10.2.2.  Categories  of  Reusable  Containers.    Reusable  containers  fall  into  two  categories, which are categorized based on the durability of the exterior shipping container and complexity of the design: 10.2.2.1.  Long-life  reusable  containers  should  withstand  a  minimum  of  100  trips.    The exterior  of  a  long-life  reusable  container  is  usually  made  of  metal,  plastic,  synthetic,  or composite materials.  It is fabricated according to an engineering drawing and produced by industrial equipment.  Base packing and crating sections usually do not have the capability to build long-life containers or the facilities or materials to repair them.  Note: Slotted angle crates (MIL-S-21041, under new design or ASTM D6255/D6255M), covered by NSNs in FSC 8140 and 8145, are long-life containers.  They can be constructed and repaired at base level. 10.2.2.2.  Short-life  reusable  containers  should  withstand  a  minimum  of  10  trips.    The exterior of a short-life reusable container is usually made of wood, plywood, fiberboard or corrugated solid plastic.  It conforms to a military, federal, or commercial specification.  The SPI describes the complete container system, including cushioning, die-cuts, inserts, fasteners,  and  exterior  container  by  a  drawing  and  bill  of  materials.    Base  packing  and crating  activities  usually  have  the  materials  and  ability  to  construct,  repair,  or  renovate short-life containers. 10.2.3.  Styles of Reusable Containers.  There are two reusable container styles based on use or  application.    Either  style  can  be  used  in  constructing  long-life  or  short-life  reusable containers. 10.2.3.1.  Specialized containers generally are the long-life category.  Specialized long-life containers will support and protect a specific item (or a limited variety of items) during AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 79 handling, storage, forward and return shipment, and unpacking by the user.  They also may protect  personnel  and  equipment  from  hazardous  contents.    This  type  of  container frequently  includes  special  features,  such  as  energy  absorbing  systems  or  temperature control systems.  Engineering drawings (or equivalent) define form, fit, function, materials, tolerances, and manufacturing techniques.  Internal fixtures or other fitments within result from  original  design  or  redesign  modifications  to  meet  weapon  system  specific applications.  Normally, maintenance activities repair specialized long-life containers and control  them  as  an  accountable  item  of  supply.    AFPTEF  may  also  be  contacted  for assistance with repairs. 10.2.3.2.  Multiapplication containers protect a variety of items within a given fragility and size  range.    They  can  be  manufactured  in  a  manner  similar  to  specialized  containers  or according to applicable military or federal specifications. 10.2.3.2.1.  Long-life  multiapplication  containers  are  described  in  MIL-STD-2073-1 and designated as Types VI through X.  The containers are made of rugged plastic and contain internal  cushioning pads or permanent  shock mitigation systems.   Examples include items such as shear mounts, steel coils, and springs.  They will protect a variety of reparable components during shipment and storage. 10.2.3.2.2.  Short-life  multiapplication  containers  include  fast  packs  and  standard packs. Fast packs are described in MIL-STD-2073-1 and designated as Types I through IV.  In addition, PPP-B-1672, Box, Shipping, Reusable with Cushioning, and T.O. 00-85B-3, list the four types of fast packs. Users or packaging personnel repair specialized short-life  containers  and  normally  do  not  stocklist  them.    However,  they  may  be stocklisted in FSC 8110 or 8115 when the volume of use dictates. 10.3.  Types  of  Reusable  SPI  Packs.  There  are  three  types  of  reusable  SPI  containers  for  AF depot level reparable items and other selected items: 10.3.1.  Fast Pack SPIs. Fast packs are a series of reusable, standardized, cushioned containers.  Basically, the containers consist of various sizes of cartons, prefitted with polyurethane foam inserts leaving hollow centers where items may be inserted for protection.  The relatively small storage space required, coupled with high reuse value and low labor/time required to repack, make fast packs efficient and cost  effective.  Each size and type of fast pack is suitable for shipping a large number of different items within certain size, weight, and fragility limits.  All fast packs may be renovated by replacing unserviceable parts.  For example, retain serviceable cushioning inserts from worn out fast packs for use in other packs that need them.  Fast packs are  available  through  GSA.    T.O.  00-85B-3  describes  fast  packs  and  the  fast  pack  SPI numbering system.  Fast pack SPI numbers are coded to indicate the method of preservation and the type and size of pack required.  The T.O. provides details for determining packaging requirements.  You do not need a copy of the SPI to comply with fast pack SPI requirements. 10.3.2.  Standard  Pack  SPIs.  Items  selected  for  standard  packs  require  less  cushioning protection than do those in  fast  packs.   Unlike fast  packs, the  cushioning in  standard packs varies according to the instruction code found in the standard pack SPI number.  The standard pack  SPI  number  indicates  the  method  of  preservation,  cushioning,  and  container  size  in  a coded form.  T.O. 00-85B-3 explains the codes used to make up standard pack SPI numbers.  The T.O. provides details for determining packaging requirements. The value of the standard pack is based on its ability to be reused in the configuration with which it is received or by 80 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 reclaiming and reusing its individual parts when it is disassembled.  A copy of the SPI is not needed to comply with standard pack SPI requirements. 10.3.3.  SPI Drawings.  A SPI drawing illustrates packaging requirements for one item or a limited group of items of the same size and shape.  SPI drawings detail special requirements for cushioning, blocking, bracing, and constructing containers.  A bill of materials may also be included in an SPI drawing.  The SPI number follows a DoD standard numbering system with Service Designator and nine-digit National Item Identification Number (NIIN) of the first item identified for the pack.  Unlike fast pack and standard pack SPI numbers, this SPI number does not contain any coded information.  Refer to the SPI drawing to manufacture the container or to package the item. 10.4.  Conservation and Care of Reusable Containers and Packaging Materials. 10.4.1.  When practical and economically feasible, containers and packaging materials, such as  wood  products,  boxes,  dunnage,  and  cushioning  materials  will  be  recovered,  saved,  and reused to package outbound shipments. 10.4.2.  Recovery  and  reuse  of  material  generated  from  unpacking  reduces  the  cost  of purchasing  new  material,  labor  required  to  package,  and  the  impact  of  waste  packaging materials on the environment. 10.4.3.  Recovery and reuse also can be utilized to provide adequate protection for reparable items requiring special packs. Protection is provided for returned items by using the packs in which like serviceable replacement items were received. 10.4.4.  Reusing containers and packaging materials. 10.4.4.1.  Carefully  open  and  unpack  material  to  prevent  damage  to  containers  and components.  Remove all protruding nails, staples, metal strapping, and other sharp metal objects. Place all container parts in, or attach them to, the container in a way to prevent loss or damage. 10.4.4.2.  Use  packs  in  which  serviceable  replacement  items  were  received  to  return  a reparable like item to the Materiel Management Flight. When a reparable like item is not immediately available, keep all interior fixtures and cushioning within the container and place it in storage. 10.4.4.3.  Remove  and  segregate  by  class  and  grade  all  cushioning  materials  (such  as flexible polyurethane foam), from packs used to ship consumable items.  Personnel should place packs in receptacles for reuse. 10.4.4.4.  Protect reclaimed material from inclement weather during recovery and storage. 10.4.4.5.  Deliver SPI packs and wood containers to the storage site in a setup condition; deliver fiberboard boxes knocked down. 10.4.4.6.  Avoid  tasks  that  may  result  in  high  labor  or  material  costs  when  reclaiming fiberboard containers. For example, do not strip tapes and labels; it can delaminate (peel the layers off) the fiberboard and reduce the number of times the container can be reused. Open the flaps by a shallow cutting of the tapes (do not cut the inner flaps). Cut off loose ends of existing tape. Tape over the original tapes and place the new label  over the old label. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 81 10.5.  Controlling Reusable Containers. 10.5.1.  Long-life containers are primary candidates for stocklisting in FSC 8140 and 8145. 10.5.2.  IMs  have  class  management  responsibility  for  FSC  8130  and  FSC  8145  long-life reusable containers.  For items without an assigned IM, contact the AFSC packaging office in the geographical area. 10.5.3.  Excess FSC 8140 and 8145 containers.  When any of the following conditions are met, the using organization provides the LRS/Materiel Management Flight the complete NSN and quantity  who  requests  the  Item  Manager  (IM)  for  redistribution  instructions;  (1)  when containers  are  not  in  use,  (2)  when  immediate  or  projected  needs  are  not  identified  or anticipated,  or  (3)  when  assets  are  not  managed  on  a  special  account  (e.g.  munitions  or engines). Upon receipt of IM instruction the organization delivers containers to Flight Service Center (LGRMMF) for turn-in and the Issue Release/Receipt Document (IRRD). 10.5.4.  The AFSC packaging office will coordinate with the IM for stocklisting of short-life containers in FSC 8110 and 8115 if the volume of usage makes it economical and the following conditions  are  met:  (1)  a  continuing  requirement  exists  and  (2)  the  pack  has  multiple applications. (T-1) 10.5.5.  Short-life containers are stocklisted for central buying and stocking by GSA. These containers are not subject to supply accountability and management procedures once issued for use. These containers are consumable and can be disposed of locally when they are beyond economical repair. 10.5.6.  Active reusable containers include all containers for which an immediate or projected need exists. When empty, active reusable SPI containers for most depot level reparable items will be managed within the RCP. Some specialized long-life containers, munitions containers, and engine containers will be turned-in to materiel management or accounted for in separate munitions and engine accounts. Containers managed within the RCP are not accounted for in special accounts or materiel management. They are considered a part of, and identified to, the item packed inside during shipment and storage. Using and packaging activities manage and reclaim empty active containers through the RCP described in this AFI. Munitions containers with budget code “H,” FSC 8140, and ERRC XD2, are managed by the munitions community in the Combat Ammunition System (CAS). 10.5.7.  FSC 8140 and 8145 containers are returned to supply accountability when containers are not in use, when immediate or projected needs are not identified or anticipated, or when they  are  not  managed  in  separate  accounts  (such  as  munitions  or  engines).  When  using  or packaging activities turn-in containers to Materiel Management Flight. 10.6.  Engineering Responsibility for Reusable Containers. 10.6.1.  The  using    System  Manager  (SM),  end-article  IM,  or  IM  has  engineering responsibility.  Testing,  engineering, and renovating surplus FSC 8140 and 8145 containers, acquired through the Container Design and Retrieval System (CDRS), are the responsibility of the acquiring activity. 10.6.2.  The  AFPTEF  will,  upon  request  and  on  a  reimbursable  basis,  provide  container engineering design, modification, test, and evaluation of containers identified for reuse. (T-1) 82 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 10.6.3.  The  prime  AFSC  packaging  office  does  not  have  responsibility  for  purchasing, repairing, or re-engineering FSC 8140 and 8145 surplus reusable containers transferred to other activities. 10.7.  Selecting and Designing Long-Life Containers.  The requirements for a long-life reusable container, whether a special engineered design or a standardized design, originate from the need to protect a given item throughout its life cycle. These procedures will be followed when selecting and designing a long-life container: 10.7.1.  When  the  buying  activity  determines  there  is  a  need  for  a  long-life  container,  the activity will use CDRS IAW AFMAN 24-206 and MIL-STD-2073-1 to determine if a design is available to satisfy the mission support requirements.  The CDRS can also be used to locate excess long-life containers to meet an acquisition requirement by providing the stock number of  containers  that  have  similar  form,  fit  and  function,  as  well  as  identifying  the  container inventory manager (within DoD). (T-0). 10.7.2.  If the  response from CDRS is  negative,  preference should be  given to  standardized off-the-shelf containers or standard designs that meet the long-life performance requirement. 10.7.3.  If  there  is  no  standardized  off-the-shelf  container  that  will  satisfy  the  mission requirement,  a  long-life  container  will  be  designed.    Contact  the  AFPTEF  for  long-life container design assistance. 10.7.4.  AF activities will consider the AFPTEF in-house design, prototype, test and evaluation capabilities before acting on any contracting out effort. (T-1). 10.7.5.  AFPTEF  must  review  and  approve  any  specifications  and  statements  of objectives/statements of work (SOO/SOW) for new long-life container designs. (T-1). 10.7.6.  After  selecting  a  standardized  off-the-shelf  long-life  container  or  approving  a  new long-life container design, the buying activity must send the design data to AFLCMC/EZPAA, CDRS Office, 5215 Thurlow Street, Bldg 70A, Ste 5, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5750, DSN 787-3362, Commercial (937) 257-3362, or enter data into CDRS IAW MIL STD 2073-1. (T-0). 10.8.  Identifying Reusable Containers.  To identify reusable containers and ensure their reuse, the following actions apply: 10.8.1.  Mark the SPI number on the exterior of the reusable container (except fast packs or standard packs). 10.8.2.  Mark  the  exterior  of  SPI  packs  and  reusable  contractor  packs  with  "REUSABLE" (except fast packs, standard packs, and long-life FSC 8140 and 8145 containers). 10.8.3.  Ensure base logistics systems print the SPI number on the DD Form 1348-1A, which provides a convenient record for identifying the item to the SPI and for ensuring the accuracy of the SPI number on the shipping container. 10.9.  Identifying SPI Numbers. 10.9.1.  AF SPIRES is the authoritative source and electronic repository for AF-managed and AF-Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) weapon system specific SPIs. Activities can identify AF and AF-CSWS managed weapon system specific SPIs for preparing materiel AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 83 for  shipment  or  storage  at  https://spires.wpafb.af.mil.  SPIRES  receives  the  SPI  number through the AF Shipping Information System (D035T) data interface. 10.9.2.  Check SPIRES  for the most  recent  SPI revision prior to  preserving  and packing  an item.  For  specific  guidance  about  SPI  drawings  and  packaging  requirements,  refer  to  the managing AFSC packaging office. Examples include container fabrication, errors, changes to item characteristics, such as dimensions and fragility. 10.9.3.  The A-D035T-801-QT-L09 and A-D035T-802-QT-L09, Quarterly SPI/Stock Number Cross-Reference products provide SPI to Stock Number (801) and Stock Number to SPI (802) cross reference, based on need.  These digital products are available upon request submitted to HQ AFMC/A4RT, Wright-Patterson AFB, via e-mail. 10.9.4.  Weapon system specific SPIs which are commonly used, may be locally maintained for  mission  support,  mobility,  contingency  planning,  and  operational  non-availability (downtime) of computer resources. Request copies of SPIs from the AFSC packaging office that manages the item during SPIRES non-availability, or when the internet is not accessible. See paragraph 8.9.2. for contact information. 10.9.5.  SPI Numbers in the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS). SBSS prints SPI numbers and other packaging instructions in  “Freight Classification Nomenclature” block of the  DD Form 1348-1A. The RIC is also provided to identify the managing AFSC packaging office. SBSS receives the SPI number through the Stock Number User Directory (SNUD) and D035T system interface. SBSS provides the following SPI information: 10.9.5.1.  SPI  number.  10  alphanumeric  positions  followed  by  the  RIC.  For  example, F003036728 FHZ. 10.9.5.2.  Fast  pack  SPI  number.  10  alphanumeric  positions  followed  by  the  RIC.  The preservation and pack code (the third from last position) will always be an “X” preceded by the preservation code and five zeros. For example, F000004XC1 FLZ. 10.9.5.3.  Standard pack SPI number. 10 alphanumeric positions followed by the RIC. The preservation code, simple instruction code, and container size code preceded by five zeros. For example, F000004C01 FGZ). 10.9.5.4.  SPI  Reconciliation  List/S02/GV847  Report.  SBSS  provides  a  listing,  in numerical  sequence  by  SPI  number,  referencing  applicable  NSNs  that  are  loaded  in  the SBSS  stock  record  account.  See  AFH  23-123,  Volume  2,  Part  2,  Paragraph  5.96.  This report  is  used  to  list  NSNs  that  require  packaging  according  to  the  specific  SPIs  or  to compare the on-hand SPI packs to those shown on the S02 listing.  Note: SPI reconciliation is no longer required. 10.9.5.5.  Other Listings. Other listings of SPI and NSN may be requested through SBSS from a program called Supply System User Report Generator (SURGE). Listings from the SURGE  program  may  be  justified  for  reusable  container  reclamation  purposes.  These listings include reusable container inventory and maintenance shops that show NSNs of containers they receive (turn-in), and the prescribed SPI number. 10.9.5.6.  If SBSS does not identify a SPI, the shipping office must reference MIL-STD-2073-1 and T.O. 00-85B-3 for minimum packaging requirements. (T-0).  See paragraph 8.2 and 8.5. 84 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 10.9.6.  Jet and reciprocating aircraft engines, BUPs, and certain munitions, are exceptions to the SPI system. T.O. 00-85-20, Engine Shipping Instructions, identifies containers for engines. 10.10.  Using Primary and Alternate SPI Packs. 10.10.1.  Specified SPI packs for shipment and storage will be used unless the managing AFSC packaging office grants a SPI waiver. 10.10.2.  If  the  SPI  specifies  a  long-life  container  as  the  primary  pack  with  a  short-life container as the alternate pack, the long-life container will be used unless it is not available through the RCP or supply channels. (T-1). 10.11.  Container  Standardization.  These  guidelines  promote  standardization  in  reusable containers: 10.11.1.  SPI drawings will specify long-life containers. 10.11.2.  Only one SPI number will be prescribed for a NSN.  When both the long-life and short-life containers are prescribed for the same item, they will be specified in the same SPI. The  long-life  container  will  be  the  primary  pack  and  the  short-life  container  will  be  the alternate pack. 10.11.3.  AFPTEF must coordinate on any new design, development, or procurement of long-life containers for AF use IAW AFMAN 24-206. (T-0). 10.11.4.  AFPTEF  must  approve  recommendations  for  adding  new  multi-application containers to AF packaging systems before development or use.  Approved multi-application containers with potential high use are recommended for inclusion in MIL-STD-2073-1. (T-1). 10.11.5.  A series of standard size containers are established to reduce the cost of fiberboard shipping containers, to simplify stacking and storage, and promote reuse. Costs are reduced through central purchase of large production runs. The GSA catalog stocklists these containers and  the  standard  pack  system  uses  them.  To  achieve  standardization,  AF  activities  buying single wall fiberboard containers, for standard packs and normal use, will order those shown in MIL-STD-2073-1, Appendix C. (T-1). 10.12.  Excess Long-Life Reusable Containers.  When an activity generates a local excess over current  or  projected  requirements,  identify,  segregate  and  inspect  the  condition  of  the  long-life reusable containers.  See paragraph 10.5.7. 10.12.1.  Turn in long-life reusable containers traced to a valid NSN to Materiel Management accounts,  engine  accounts  or  munitions  accounts,  as  appropriate,  for  redistribution.  Redistribute long-life reusable containers that are separately accounted for only at the direction of the IM. 10.12.2.  If  the  IM  does  not  need  the  containers,  the  IM  reports  them  to  the  CDRS  office, AFLCMC/EZPAA, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, email: CDRS@us.af.mil, to find a use for the containers.  The CDRS database identifies most of the FSC 8140 and 8145 long-life reusable containers from the FEDLOG system.  If the containers are high quality with high value for future applications, the CDRS office may look for storage options while looking for a using customer within DOD.  Note: The CDRS office is not a storage location. 10.12.3.  Excess long-life containers are not transferred to DLADS unless guidance is received from the IM. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 85 10.13.  Excess Short-Life Reusable Containers. 10.13.1.  Report excess new or serviceable short-life FSC 8110 and 8115 containers in RECON for  redistribution  to  other  AF  units  when  the  quantity  or  economic  value  of  the  containers justifies  the  cost  of  redistributing  them.  RECON  provides  the  capability  to  identify  excess serviceable short-life containers and packaging materials for possible redistribution to AF units that need them; ensuring maximum reuse throughout the DTS. 10.13.2.  Redistribution of RECON supported containers may be funded by unit O&M funds or Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF).  Shippers ensure that the appropriate funding is applied  for  when  requesting  shipment  of  containers.    When  DWCF  does  not  apply,  the requester/receiving unit must provide a TAC or MORD/SDN. (T-1).  See Chapter 5 and AF cargo funding memorandums for a table of DWCF TACs to use (based on budget code).  When using  a  DWCF  TAC,  ensure  the  container  NSN  is  included  on  the  shipping  document, otherwise payment by TAC maybe be denied. Redistribution of non-DWCF containers will be unit O&M funded. 10.13.3.  Dispose  of  used  short-life  containers  and  packaging  materials  above  local requirements when it is not economical to reclaim or redistribute them. If a local market will buy waste packaging materials, sale of non-usable excess for recycling is the preferred method of disposal. 10.13.4.  Bundle excess used consolidation containers in serviceable condition and report them in RECON or return them to the nearest ALC depot or other AF activities with a valid need by opportune airlift or other low-cost transportation. 10.13.5.  Flatten  disposable  containers  that  are  not  reclaimed  before  placing  them  in  refuse receptacles or pickup sites. Do not attempt to recycle oil-contaminated fiberboard. 10.13.6.  Items inside reclaimed containers. 10.13.6.1.  Ensure  containers  are  empty  before  you  redistribute,  recycle,  or  dispose  of them. 10.13.6.2.  Return items found in reclaimed containers to the accountable activity. If the item  or  activity  cannot  be  identified  from  the  container,  turn-in  the  item  to  Materiel Management Flight or Flight Service Center as Found on Base. 10.14.  Implementing  The  RCP.  At  Installation/Wing,  an  effective  RCP  will  be  implemented IAW DoDM 4140.01-V9, Enclosure 3 and AFMAN 24-206, maximizing recovery and reuse of containers. (T-1).  At the Wing's discretion, this includes, but is not limited to, reimbursement or transfer of funds from Host and Tenant units for lost/destroyed reusable containers. This provides the  wing  direct  control  over  their  program  so  they  can  adapt  it  to  meet  their  specific  mission requirements.  Note:  Due  to  the  joint  AF  DLA  collaborative  relationship  at  the  ALCs,  AFMC AFSC will use appropriate RCP guidelines IAW AFMCI 24-201, AFMC Packaging and Materials Handling Policies and Procedures. (T-1).  At a minimum, an effective program will: 10.14.1.  Identify the collection, screening, and storage sites and ensure that they are separated from refuse and supply pickup sites. (T-1). 10.14.2.  Ensure  that  reusable  containers  for  reparable  items  are  available  for  repackaging items for storage and shipment to the ALC depot or TRC. (T-1). 86 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 10.14.3.  Identify  procedures  and  responsibilities  for  recovering,  collecting,  screening, inspecting for assets inadvertently left in containers, and storing containers and materials. (T-1). 10.14.4.  Identify procedures for obtaining containers and materials from storage and screening and disposing of excesses. (T-1).  10.14.5.  Establish a Reusable Container Program Working  Group, (RCPWG) to meet at least once  a  year  but  NLT  30  June  of  each  FY.    Representatives  from  Aerospace  Maintenance, Materiel  Management,  Munitions  &  Weapons,  Traffic  Management,  other  major  shipping activities,  and  unit  resource  advisors  shall  participate  in  the  working  group.  (T-1).    The objectives  is  to  coordinate  actions,  review  budgetary  and  operational  requirements  for  the current and upcoming FY, analyze deficiencies, and recommend corrective actions to reduce costs impacting the RCP. 10.14.6.  RCPWG should: 10.14.6.1.  Identify  units  required  to  operate  a  RCP  and  establish  local  procedures  for evaluating  deficiencies  in  the  program.    Establish  procedures  for  performing  corrective action,  to  include  review  of  AF  Forms  451,  SFs  364  or  WebSDR  submittals,  and  SPI waivers. 10.14.6.2.  Identify procedures and responsibilities for processing AF Form 451 for items received  for  shipment  without  the  required  SPI  pack,  as  well  as  AF  Form  406, Miscellaneous Obligation/Reimbursement Document (MORD), AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization, DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR), and GPC  accounts  for  reimbursement  or  prior  transfer  of  funds,  as  required,  for  packaging services. 10.15.  RCP  Evaluation  and  Efficiency.  The  following  goals  are  established  to  enhance  the RCP: improve training and awareness; eliminate reusable container loss, unauthorized waste and destruction; promote reusable container conservation. 10.15.1.  To  measure  program  effectiveness  and  efficiency,  the  RCPM  will  perform  annual inspections of the organizational units’ reusable container storage areas.  (T-1).  The RCPM will prepare and utilize the annual report. (T-1).  Report distribution will include the primary UCMs, applicable unit commanders and AFIMSC/IZSL. (T-1).  At a minimum the report shall include  Reusable  Container  Return  Efficiency  and  Reusable  Container  Storage  and Conservation. (T-1). 10.15.1.1.  Reusable Container Return Efficiency.  In the past 12 months: 10.15.1.1.1.  Number  of  AF  Form  451s  submitted  and  the  associated  total  cost  for supplies (EEIC 609) and labor (EEIC 39711) to provide/construct reusable containers. 10.15.1.1.2.  Number of AF Form 451s submitted due to loss/destruction of reusable containers (list unit responsible, item nomenclature and SPI number) and the associated cost to provide/construct reusable containers. 10.15.1.2.  Reusable Container Storage and Conservation.  In the past 12 months: 10.15.1.2.1.  Total number of reusable container storage areas on the installation, total number  of  areas  inspected,  total  number  of  areas  not  inspected  and  percentages: AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 87 inspected  and  not  inspected.    Note:  For  units  not  inspected,  the  report  must  list  the organization and the reason not inspected. (T-1). 10.15.1.2.2.  Deficiencies identified during inspection (list date identified, category of deficiency, unit and status (open/closed)). Deficiencies will be categorized as Major or Minor. 10.15.1.2.2.1.  Major  deficiencies  include:    reusable  containers  discarded  in waste/refuse receptacles; reusable containers susceptible to weather damage stored in location exposed to weather; reusable containers stored in manner which could damage  reusable  containers;  evidence  of  improper  opening/closing  of  reusable containers;  reusable  container  components  not  stored  with  container  for  which designed; reusable containers used for other than intended purpose; and reusable containers not stored in designated storage areas. 10.15.1.2.2.2.  Minor deficiencies include: storage areas not identified; storage area housekeeping; and storage area used for other than storing reusable containers. 10.15.2.  The annual report shall be completed and distributed NLT 30 days after inspection is complete.  (T-1).    The  applicable  wing  and  group  commander  should  receive  a  copy  of  the report when there is a significant cost as a result of reusable container loss/destruction. 88 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 Chapter 11 DISCREPANCY REPORTS AND TRACING PROCEDURES 11.1.  Purpose.  This  chapter  provides  guidance  for  tracing  overdue  shipment  and  reporting discrepancies using the SDR and TDR. 11.2.  General.  The SDR is used to report shipping and packaging discrepancies attributable to the consignor, which includes DoD components, contractors and vendors.  The primary purpose of the SDR program is to report, analyze, correct, reduce, and prevent recurrence of discrepancies.  The TDR is used to document discrepancies attributable to a commercial or government TSP and additional purposes prescribed in DTR. 11.2.1.  See paragraph 11.6 for TDR guidance and Attachment 9 for SDR procedures. 11.3.  WebSDR Accounts. 11.3.1.  Personnel  submit an online System Authorization Access  Request  (SAAR) to  DLA Transaction Services to gain access to the DoD WebSDR system website. 11.3.2.  A unit SDR organizational e-mail address may be added by contacting the help team via e-mail. 11.3.3.  SDR training slides are located in the WebSDR homepage after accessing the systems. 11.3.4.  IAW  AFI  23-101  use  the  Enterprise  Solution-Supply  (ES-S)  SDR  function  as  the primary  means  to  submit  SDRs  and  SF  Form  364.    Use  DoD  WebSDR  to  submit  supply discrepancies when the ES-S SDR function system is not available.  WebSDR may be used to upload photographs and supporting documentation when required or requested by an activity IAW AFMAN 23-122. (T-1). 11.3.5.  Submit  a  SDR  for  documentation,  packaging,  markings,  unitization,  shortages, overages, and misdirected shipments IAW DLM 4000.25, Vol. 2, Chapter 17. (T-0). 11.3.5.1.  Attach an SDR to the container when the item is suspended or misdirected. 11.3.5.2.  For any discrepancies involving AA&E, classified, sensitive, NWRM and items of $20,000 value, follow procedures in paragraph 4.9.7. 11.3.6.  Do not submit a SDR when a SPI deviation is authorized IAW paragraph 8.9. 11.3.7.  SDR exclusions are listed in DLM 4000.25, Vol. 2, Chapter 17. 11.4.  Incoming  SDRs.  Customer  Support  Liaison  Element  (LGRMCC)  is  responsible  for resolving and distributing discrepancies to the responsible activities impacted by the SDR.  The Cargo  Movement  Section  assists  in  researching,  reviewing  and  resolving  discrepancies  when necessary.  Refer to AFMAN 23-122. 11.5.  Evaluation of the SDR Process. 11.5.1.  The LRS appointed Accountable Officer ensures detailed SDR data is maintained to analyze  their  programs.    SDR  quality  programs  identify  trends  and  problems  with  shipping activities,  and  assist  in  preventing  reoccurrences.    The  number  of  SDRs  submitted  and received, dollar value, discrepancy type, number of follow-ups responses received, unresolved SDRs, and dollar values recovered are measured. (T-2). AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 89 11.5.2.  This  same  data  is  compiled  and  forwarded  semi-annually  by  the  Customer  Support Section  to  the  LRS  Operations  Compliance  Office  QA  Section  for  distribution  to AFIMSC/MAJCOMs/AFRC/ANG.  Refer  to  AFI  23-101.    Note:  Minimum  SDR  data requirements are identified in AFMAN 23-122, Table 5.6. 11.6.  Transportation Discrepancies. 11.6.1.  Proper  completion  of  documentation  and  supporting  documents  are  essential  to  the recovery of funds for which the government is entitled.  Refer to DTR Part II, Chapter 210 and  Appendix  I.    Notification  of  transportation  discrepancies  enables  the  Government  to recover  funds  and  prevent  future  transportation  discrepancies.    Air  Force  shipping  and receiving  activities  will  process  and  report  over,  short,  damage  (OS&D),  astray  cargo  and miscellaneous  discrepancies  using  the  DD  Form  361,  Transportation  Discrepancy  Report (TDR). (T-0).  Refer to IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter 210. The TDR is also the source document upon which claims are based.  Note: HAZMAT and TPS TDRs will have priority over general cargo discrepancies. (T-1). 11.6.2.  DoD freight shipping and receiving activities are required to electronically generate TDRs using the Discrepancy Identification System (DIS).  DIS is an application within GFM at the SDDC ETA website, https://eta.sddc.army.mil/ refer to DTR Part II, Chapter 210. (T-0). 11.7.  FMS Discrepant Materiel.  When FMS discrepant materiel is returned to the custody of the U.S. Government, the materiel is turned in with an SDR to the nearest U.S. accountable military activity (regardless of military service responsible for the materiel) and processed in accordance with  U.S.  procedures.  Shipping  Activities  send  shipping  documents  to  the  appropriate  Federal Records Center and retain copies IAW AFRIMS Table 24 - 01. The shipment should be turned in on a DD Form 1348-1A showing a proper TAC and DoDAAC/MAPAC. No hazardous materials is accepted without a properly prepared Shipper‘s Declaration of Dangerous Goods, refer to DTR Part II Appendix E for additional information. (T-0). 11.7.1.

AF Government Cargo Recovery Effort (GOCARE) Program. 11.8.1.  GOCARE is a DOD program run by SDDC Strategic Business Directorate to direct and  guide  the  DOD  in  efforts  to  recover  lost  cargo  found  in  CONUS  commercial  TSP warehouses  (Freight  terminals,  HHG  warehouses  and  storage  locations,  other  commercial warehouses).  DTR,  Part  II,  Chapter  209,  Loss  and  Damage,  provides  guidance  and  DoD policy  for  GOCARE.  GOCARE  Guidelines  are  published  on  the  SDDC  website  at: https://www.sddc.army.mil/domTrans/Pages/default.aspx.    AF  CONUS  organizations follow  the  DTR,  SDDC  GOCARE  guidelines,  and  these  instructions  in  implementing  the program. (T-1). 11.8.2.  AF  Active,  Reserve  and  ANG  TOs  appoint  a  GOCARE  Committee  Members  who work  with  local  commercial  TSPs  and  businesses  to  encourage  communications  in  the 90 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 recovery of lost and astray DoD freight.  Committee members contact the TSPs in their area of responsibility at least once a quarter by phone call or visit to the TSP’s facilities.  At least one visit to each TSP’s facility is required annually.  When two or more DoD transportation activities resides in the same area of responsibility (i.e. Active and ANG units co-located, Joint Basing, etc.), coordinate visits and quarterly contact of TSP facilities to prevent duplication of effort. 11.8.2.1.  The annual  TSP facility visits  are mandatory unless waived by AFMC/A4RT.  To request a waiver, send an e-mail to the AFMC/A4RT Workflow box. In the Subject line enter:   Include justification/rationale for the waiver in the body of the e-mail. (T-1).   GOCARE  Commercial  TSP  Annual  Visit  Waiver  Request. 11.8.3.  Committee members will report quarterly the results of their visits and/or phone calls for each TSP facility contacted.  (T-1). 11.8.3.1.  Quarterly  reports  will  be  submitted  via  the  Logistics  Tools  Suite  (LTS) GOCARE Reporting Tool at https://trackerlite.wpafb.af.mil/LTSR/.  (T-1). 11.8.3.2.  Submission of quarterly reports are due NLT the 15th day of the month following the end of the quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct).  (T-1). 11.8.4.  AFMC/A4RT will forward the AF report to SDDC and AF/A4LR NLT the 21th of the month the reports are due.  (T-0). Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 209. 11.8.5.  Any freight that is found and the proper owner cannot be determined, submit a DD Form 361, refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 210. 11.8.6.  Funding  for  the  re-shipment  of  recovered  astray  freight  that  is  of  no  fault  of  the commercial TSP. 11.8.6.1.  If available, quote the funds on the delivery documents to re-ship the recovered material after coordination with TAC Manager. 11.8.6.2.  If the fund-cite is not available, contact the origin shipper. 11.8.6.3.  If  only  the  NSN  is  available,  coordinate  with  servicing  base  Materiel Management Flight or IM for disposition. 11.8.7.  If available information and coordination can not provide resolution, process through the servicing base Materiel Management Flight, Customer Service Section for disposition. 11.8.8.  If the TSP is at fault, ship on a ―”Free Astray Basis”. This includes FMS shipments. 11.8.9.  To obtain disposition instructions for recovered astray FMS shipments (when loss is not responsibility of TSP) contact the origin shipping office.  If assistance is needed, contact AFLCMC/WFALC, 1822 Van Patton Drive, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433-5332, (1-937-522-6570) for disposition instructions. 11.9.  Track  and  Trace.  The  Cargo  Movement  Section  uses  the  Integrated  Data  Environment (IDE)/Global Transportation Network (GTN) Convergence (IGC) to assist customers determine the status and location of their shipments when they have been delayed, misplaced, or upgraded in priority, see DTR, Part II, Chapter 202.  Prior to initiating tracer action, the customer requesting assistance  must  provide  proof  of  shipment  that  the  freight  has  been  tendered  to  a  carrier  for AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 91 transportation and that normal transit time has expired or experienced undue delay.  (T-1).  The requestor must provide the TCN assigned to the shipment. 11.10.  Requisition  Tracing  .    When  requisitions  (shipments)  become  overdue  or  lost  in transportation channels, the retail supply system generates the Transportation Tracer Listing (TTL) for items requiring tracer action.  The Customer Support Liaison Element reviews the shipments on the TTL and take appropriate action IAW AFMAN23-122 prior to giving the listing to IC for action. The Customer Support Liaison Element provides the TTL to IC twice each month.  Note: If any other statement is provided, Customer Support Liaison Element personnel may return the listing to IC for appropriate action. (T-1). 11.10.1.  IC uses IGC to determine the status or location of shipments that are overdue or lost in transportation channels. 11.10.2.  Upon receipt of the TTL immediately compare to the previous listing for any repeats. If  the  majority  of  line  items  are  repeats  from  the  previous  TTL,  annotate"Previously Researched by the Cargo Movement Section,” and return the TTL to Customer Support. 11.10.3.  Use the TCN or BL listed on the TTL to trace in IGC.  For shipments from OCONUS bases  where  IGC  does  not  provide  updated  transportation  data,  annotate  “TM1  action required.” 11.10.4.  When  IGC  indicates  the  shipment  has  been  received  on  base  utilize  the  carrier website or contact the carrier to obtain Proof of Delivery (POD).  See DTR Part II for POD criteria.  Annotate TTL with “Received or in file (date).” 11.10.5.  When IGC indicates the shipment has departed the origin but not delivered, contact the TSP listed to obtain updated shipment status. 11.10.5.1.  When the TSP provides updated shipment status before the TTL is due back to Customer Support, correct the transportation data with current information and annotate “Updated shipment status.” 11.10.5.2.  When the TSP does not  send a response by the time the TTL is  due back to Customer Support, submit a TDR to the TSP using the Discrepancy Identification System (DIS) application with Global Freight Management (GFM). Submit and suspense TDRs IAW DTR Part II, Chapter 210. Annotate “TO tracing.” 11.10.6.  When IGC does not list the TSP and associated movement document number, inform the Customer Support Liaison Element that there is no evidence or proof of shipment and tracer action cannot be performed. The IM or SOS should provide the required information to execute track and trace. 11.10.7.  Suspense and follow-up on TDR submissions IAW DTR Part II, Chapter 210. 11.10.7.1.  When a reply to a TDR is received with updated shipment status, correct the transportation data with current information and annotate “Updated shipment status.” 11.10.7.2.  When a reply to a TDR is received that indicates the shipment was lost in the transportation channels or a TDR is unanswered, attach the TDR to the TTL and annotate “DD 361/Message attached.” 11.10.8.  Return the Listing. IC returns the annotated TTL to the Customer Service within 5 GBD of receipt.  IC retains a file copy (electronic or manual). 92 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 11.11.  Delinquent Shipment Listing process.  OC should compare entries against the property shipped files, and annotate each entry after review.  Return copies of documents with the listing if they have not previously been provided to the Customer Support Liaison Element. 11.11.1.  If  the  item  has  been  shipped,  enter  the  mode,  TCN,  date  shipped,  hold  code,  etc.  Alternatively, simply attach a copy of the shipment planning worksheet. 11.11.2.  Enter  Julian  date  shipment  was  made  if  confident  of  the  date  although  unable  to provide hold data or TCN/GBL. 11.11.3.  Enter "no record of receipt from the Materiel Management Flight" if there is no record of the item being received from the Materiel Management Flight. 11.11.4.  Line out those entries for which movement data was previously submitted. 11.11.5.  Return  completed  Delinquent  Shipment  Listing  to  the  Customer  Support  Liaison Element within 5 GBDs after receipt. 11.12.  Additional procedures for CMOS operating locations. 11.12.1.  Check the Volume of the MILSTRIP shipments manually in-checked (without pre-positioned  data  from  the  ES-S  in  file).    If  there  is  a  need  to  manually  enter  shipments  or requisitions into CMOS, it could indicate a problem with communication flow between ES-S and CMOS. Have your system administrator contact your site's communication network and/or system helpdesk to verify communications are uninterrupted.  If all shipments to a specific off-base organization (usually document identifier ISU, MSI, or DOR) for a single organization code (X373AA12341234) or all shipments to DLADS are having to be manually in-checked (no advanced information from ES-S), have base supply ensure the off-base indicator is set correctly. Documents with identifier TRM have to be manually input. 11.12.2.  Check the accuracy of the MILSTRIP shipments manually in-checked, without pre-positioned data from the ES-S in file. Any variance (e.g. FB instead of FE, transposed digits, system designator 01 instead of A1, etc.) between the supply document number and the system designator on the document and the input to CMOS will cause the SSC message to fail at the ES-S and the correct TCN may appear on both Part 5 and Part 6 of the Delinquent Shipment Listing.  Ensure MILSTRIP shipments manually in-checked (without pre-positioned data) are assigned  "Doc  Type"  of  "M"  at  the  "Shipment  Planning  Detail"  window.  CMOS  does  not produce data for the ES-S for any other "Doc Type. 11.12.3.  Is the Materiel Management Flight researching and correcting the rejects (type 260) from  SSCs  returned  to  the  ES-S  with  erroneous  (non-matching)  system  designators  or document numbers? 11.12.4.  Check the inbound message log for messages with transmission mode of "DAAS" and transmission status of "F" (failed).  Review the associated priority message to determine the cause of the failure. Ensure CMOS team at the Field Assistance Service (FAS) (DSN 596-5771, option 1,3,4) has been notified and/or has an ES-S discrepancy report been submitted. 11.12.5.  Release all shipments by close-of-business on the date shipped.  Ensure every item in  all  consolidated  shipments  has  been  in-checked,  linked  to  the  lead  TCN,  and  released  in CMOS.  The release action generates the communication messages for all CMOS interfaces, including the ES-S and is essential for ITV and accurate record keeping. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 93 11.12.6.  If items appear on the Delinquent Shipment Listing even though the shipment was in-checked and/or shipped and released, prior to the date of the Delinquent Shipment Listing, select  three  to  five  examples  that  were  in-checked  and/or  shipped  within  the  last  30  days.  Consult  the  base  Materiel  Management  Flight  leadership  to  ensure  that  the  ES-S  shipment suspense  record  for  each  example  still  does  not  contain  the  in-checked  or  shipment information.    Check  the  outbound  message  log  and  select  the  corresponding  message  and delete the Transmission Status field.   This will cause the message to  be resent  to  the ES-S.  Coordinate with the Management and Systems document control activity supervisor and obtain feedback  as to  when these messages (specific TCNs) are received and  whether they loaded data correctly or rejected (failed).  If they have not been received within a reasonable time, check the transmission status field and ensure it had changed back to a "P" (processed).  Then ensure all DLA-TS connections are up and talking to each other.  If the Transmission Status field changed to an "F" (failed), see paragraph 11.12.4. 11.13.  Tracing OCONUS DTS Shipments.  Tracing can be accomplished through IGC, Tracker, GATES, and other automated systems.  For customers who do not have access to automated means of tracing overseas shipments, contact the Air Force ACA by telephone or e-mail at Scott AFB, IL.  The ACA traces shipment(s) by TCN and provides shipping status to the requesting activity as follows: 11.13.1.  If no record is found, or if there is only a record of the ATCMD, the requester should go back to the originating point (shipper or supplier) for status. 11.13.2.  If there is a record of POE receipt, the ACA checks with the APOE Customer Service Branch for status and advise the requester. 11.13.3.  If there is a record of receipt and lift, the ACA advises the shipper. 94 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 Chapter 12 MANAGEMENT OF INTERMODAL (ISO) CONTAINERS AND 463L ASSETS 12.1.  ISO Container Management. 12.1.1.  ISO or intermodal containers are used for the intermodal transport of freight.  They are manufactured  according  to  specifications  from  the  ISO  and  are  suitable  for  multiple transportation  methods  such  as  truck,  rail,  or  ship.    These  regulations  define  a  shipping container that meets size, strength, and durability requirements.  The basis of these regulations is to guarantee that the container can withstand extreme environments endured during transport as  well  as  possess  the  structural  integrity  needed  to  be  lifted  by  cranes  or  other  heavy equipment.  There are several basic types of ISO containers including flat racks, open-top, dry freight, insulated, reefer, and tank containers. 12.1.1.1.  For container management support or general questions, the TO can contact the AFIMSC/IZSL  at  DSN:  969-8329, Comm:  (210) 395-8329, e-mail  or the AF Container Manager (AFMC/A4RT) at DSN: 986-3300, (937) 656-3300, e-mail. 12.1.2.  The TO has primary responsibility at the installation/activity for the management of all ISO containers and equipment including chassis system assets. Installation commanders (or their designated representative), must appoint a primary and alternate installation CCO to act as installation SMEs for container management. (T-0).  Refer to DTR, Part VI. to 12.1.2.1.  All  CCO AFMC.A4RT.Workflow@us.af.mil  with  attention  to  “Air  Force  Container  Manager.” (T-1). letters  must appointment current sent and be 12.1.3.  The installation CCO shall maintain positive control, ensure accurate accounting and reporting,  and  use  JCM  to  manage  all  DoD-Owned  ISO  containers  on  the  installation regardless of Service ownership (e.g. Army, Marines, Navy, and other Federal Agencies). (T-0).  The installation CCO will ensure that units on the installation (e.g. munitions, medical, civil  engineering,  tenant  units,  etc.)  that  own,  manage,  maintain,  or  otherwise  use  ISO containers have a primary and alternate unit CCO appointed and trained who will report the units’ containers in JCM. (T-1).  All CCO personnel changes must be updated in JCM. (T-1).  Note: Unit CCOs should receive training from the installation CCO or TO. SDDC’s Electronic Transportation 12.1.4.  CCO(s) request access to “Business Support & Container Management” application Portal on https://eta.sddc.army.mil/ETASSOPortal/Default.aspx ISO containers on their installation.  Requesting access gives the CCO(s) access to Army Container Asset  Management  System  (ACAMS),  Pipeline  Asset  Tool  (PAT)  and  JCM  system.    The appointed  CCO(s)  also  completes  the  Container  Re-inspection  Course,  NOSSA-CSCCR-AMMO43-1.0.  Container management training material and instructions on how to register for the CSC re-inspection course can be located on the AF Intermodal Container Management SharePoint®. to  effectively  manage Acquisition (ETA) 12.2.  ISO Inventory Management. 12.2.1.  Regardless  of the total  number of  ISO containers reported on-hand or owned by  an installation,  The  TO  conducts  both  an  annual  physical  verification  of  containers  on  the AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 95 installation as well as participate in the DoD Biennial container inventory.  Installation CCOs perform  a  pivotal  role  during  the  annual  physical  verification  and  the  DoD  Biennial  ISO inventories.  In order to capture a 100% inventory of all DoD-owned intermodal distribution platform  assets,  there  are  three  primary  categories  of  verification  that  require  validation  in JCM.  Refer to the JCM training material located on the AF Intermodal Container Management SharePoint® Site.  Note: All updates are processed in JCM. 12.2.1.1.  Owner  verification  –  validation  of  the  assets  that  are  the  property  of  the individual’s unit/organization. 12.2.1.2.  Location verification – validation of the assets that are actually on-hand at the individual’s location. 12.2.1.3.  Next  Inspection  Date  Verification  –  validation  of  the  next  inspection  date  as indicated on DD Form 2282, Reinspection Decal Convention for Safe Containers (CSC). 12.2.2.  Owner verification.  The owner verification process requires the validation of assets that  are  registered  as  being  owned  by  the  unit/organization  as  identified  by  the  “Owner DoDAAC”  field  in  ACAMS  as  well  as  the  DoD  ISO  Registry.    It  is  important  to  maintain accurate ownership data for each piece of equipment so that AIDPMO can ensure the DoD ISO registry is up to date.  By reporting  you’re “Owned Assets,”  you are verifying that the information recorded in the DoD ISO Register as being correct.  The method of reporting this information within JCM is to select “Yes” to concur with the ownership or “No” if you do not concur.  Every asset reported as owned by the Owner DoDAAC in JCM should be reported with a “Yes” or a “No.”  For any “No” reports, AIDPMO contacts the CCO to reconcile the ownership. 12.2.3.  Location  Verification.    The  location  verification  process  requires  the  validation  of assets reported as on-hand at the site per ACAMS and/or JCM.  Prior to conducting the location verification  event  in  JCM,  a  100%  wall-to-wall  inventory  must  be  completed.  (T-1).    The containers inventoried are first be received to the location DoDAAC.  The method of reporting this information with JCM is to select a “Yes” if the container is at the location or “No” if an asset is not at the CCO’s location.  Every asset reported as being at the Location DoDAAC in JCM should be reported with a “Yes” or a “No.”  For any “No” reports, AIDPMO contacts the CCO to reconcile the location of the assets. 12.2.4.  Next  Inspection  Date  Verification.    During  the  inventory  process,  validate  the  next inspection date on DD Form 2282.  The “Next Inspection” column enables you to input the next inspection date in the format of mm/yyyy. 12.2.5.  Installation CCO(s) report all ISO Container Program related problems or concerns to the Air Force Container Manager (AFMC/A4RT) via e-mail, DSN: 986-3300, (937) 656-3300. 12.3.  Container Shipment Management. 12.3.1.  Inbound Containers.  In coordination with the TO and installation CCO(s), receiving organizations develops an intermodal container receipt and download plan to ensure the timely return of ISO containers to the TO.   Note: The installation CCO(s) checks JCM in order to determine container ownership.  Installation CCO(s) takes appropriate actions based upon the container ownership. 96 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 12.3.1.1.  USG Owned Containers.  The unloading/unpacking organization does not return USG  containers  to  the  commercial  carrier/Transportation  Service  Provider  (TSP).    The receiving unit/activity keeps the ISO container & cargo contents at the unit’s location on the  installation  and  reports  back  to  the  installation  CCO(s)  with  all  pertinent  container information required to accomplish the annual ISO inventory (e.g. current location, current use, serviceability and Unit Point of Contact).  The AF Container Manager provides ISO disposition instructions to the TO when the receiving unit no longer needs to keep the USG container on the installation. 12.3.1.2.  Commercial  Containers.   Carrier-owned  containers  are  owned  by  the international commercial shipping companies and start to draw detention charges based on the terms of the Universal Services Contract (USC) booking for that particular container as well as the provisions for “Free Time” written into the USC contract.  Therefore, it’s imperative that installation CCOs take appropriate actions in order to return the commercial container  to  the  carrier  in  a  timely  manner  in  order  to  prevent  unnecessary  government detention charges.  The TO validates all container detention charges in Pipeline Asset Tool prior to authorizing payment.  Detention bills are processed IAW DTR Part VI, Chapter 606, Figures 606 1 and 606 2. 12.3.1.2.1.  Because free time can be used (and in some cases fully consumed) before the container arrives at destination, the Air Force goal for receiving units/installations is to receive, unload, and return the commercial container to the carrier within 12 hours of receipt. 12.3.1.2.2.  The  may  move  empty  commercial  ISO  containers  to  a  transportation holding/staging area awaiting carrier pickup.  Once the container is picked up by the carrier, the installation CCO logs into Pipeline Asset Tool and perform both the “Notify Carrier  Container  Available  for  Pickup”  and  “Report  Container  Pickup”  functions under the “Container Return Management” tab in order to stop the detention clock and complete the container life cycle.  Note: Refer to the PAT training material located on the AF Intermodal Container Management SharePoint® Site. 12.3.2.  Outbound Containers.  Units requesting ISO container(s) for movement provide the TO with the quantity and type of containers needed to support outbound shipments.  The TO determines if containers are available on the installation to satisfy the mission requirement.  If containers are not readily available, the TO can use commercial containers or contact the AF Container Manager for assistance in securing USG or leased containers.  Note: The TO uses SDDC’s Integrated Booking System (IBS) Web Sustainment System to book sealift shipments in the DTS. 12.3.3.  In the event that other Service owned, common-user, or MILVAN ISO containers are used  for  a  shipment,  the  TO  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  serviceable  CSC  certified containers are provided to the cargo loading and packing activities regardless of commodity. 12.3.4.  Prior to using any non-AF owned containers for shipment or storage, the installation CCO(s) gain approval from the AF Container Manager and AIDPMO.  CCO(s) submit these requests  by  e-mail  to  AFMC/A4RT  through  AFIMSC  or  their  respective  COCOM  Theater Container Manager (TCM) and component CC. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 97 12.3.5.  Once appropriate number of containers is available on the installation, the TO arranges delivery  of  the  containers  to  the  loading/packing  organization.    Unit  CCO(s)  perform  an acceptance inspection to  ensure  ISO containers and equipment  provided meet  specific CSC certification  requirements.    Loading/packing  organizations  reject  unserviceable  containers, equipment, Flat-Racks, and chassis system assets, and reports them to the TO for pick-up and replacement.  The TO orders replacement ISOs or coordinate repairs if necessary. 12.3.6.  CCO(s)  annotate  “CSC  certified  CAT-V  Ammunition  Type  Containers”  on  request documentation for munitions containers to prevent unacceptable delay and unnecessary costs to AF Containerized Ammunition Distribution System (CADS) operations, refer to AFI 21-201.    Note:  The  CCO(s)  considers  explosive  safety  requirements  prior  to  storage  in  the installation Munitions Storage  Area.  Refer to  AFMAN 91-201, and  consult with  the Wing Safety Office. 12.3.7.  ISO  containers  moving  via  Mil-Air  require  a  valid/certified  ATTLA  certification.  Certifications can be found on the ATTLA SharePoint®. 12.3.8.  Within 12 hours of receipt or shipment, the Installation CCO(s) take appropriate action within JCM to either “Receive” or “Ship” the container(s).  Note: Refer to the JCM training material located on the AF Intermodal Container Management SharePoint® Site. 12.4.  New Container & Leased Container Management. 12.4.1.  New Containers.  New shipping containers must adhere to the guidelines outlined in Annex I of the International Convention for Safe Containers (CSC). (T-0).  Annex I includes regulations for the testing, inspection, approval and maintenance of ISO containers. 12.4.2.  AFMC Stock Control activities contacts USAF Intermodal (ISO) Container Manager at HQ AFMC/A4RT, before requisitioning any Federal Stock Class (FSC) 8150 containers, refer  to  AFH  23-123  V2PT1  and  AFMAN  23-122.    Requisition  Exception  (REX)  code  6, Exception Notice Code (ENC) R is assigned to identify assets requiring ISO containers.  This is  to  prevent  AF  units  from  requisitioning  ISO  containers  that  may  already  exist  and  are available within the DoD inventory. 12.4.3.  CCO(s) coordinate(s) customer's requirements for new container designs with ATTLA at AFLCMC/EZFC via e-mail.  See DoDI 4540.07. 12.4.4.  Before purchasing or requisitioning new ISO containers, CCO(s), Program Managers, and  Air  Force  units  contact  the  AF  Container  Manager  (AFMC/A4RT)  via  e-mail,  or  Com (937)656-3300 / DSN: 986-3300 to determine whether other “government owned” containers are available within the DoD inventory to satisfy their mission requirements. 12.4.5.  If AF Container Manager approves new procurement, units will procure, purchase, re-stencil, inspect, track, and maintain ISO containers IAW DTR Part VI. (T-0). 12.4.6.  Leased Containers.  Consider leasing containers in lieu of new procurement for short term or temporary requirements to save DoD funds.  Air Force units will forecast and budget for leasing containers to support the units’ mission. (T-1).  AIDPMO is the single manager of the  Army  leasing  program  and  serves  as  the  Authorized  Ordering  Authority  (AOA)  for  all Department  of  Army  (DA)  and  other  Services  when  requested  for  intermodal  equipment obtained  under  the  Headquarters  (HQ)  Surface  Deployment  and  Distribution  Command (SDDC) contract. 98 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 12.4.6.1.  The  TO  or  installation  CCO  contacts  the  AF  Container  Manager  for  leasing details.   CCO(s) manage leased containers  IAW DTR, Part VI,  Chapter  602, IMODAL CTR PROC, and issue Container Movement Reports (CMR), IAW DTR, Part VI, Chapter 605, CMR/TRACK/INVENTORY. 12.4.6.2.  Receiving  units  perform  an  acceptance  inspection  to  ensure  that  leased  ISO containers and equipment is serviceable and meets their mission requirements at the time of  delivery.    Units  reject  leased  ISO  containers  and  equipment  that  are  unserviceable, damaged, or defective. 12.4.6.3.  The TO obtains written approval from the AF Container Manager, AIDPMO and lessor prior to repairing any leased containers and equipment IAW DTR, Part VI, Chapter 604, INSP/MAINT/REPAIR. 12.4.6.4.  The TO contacts the AIDPMO Leasing Team at DSN: 770-4468 or via e-mail to terminate any lease when the containers are no longer required or have been emptied & ready for return to the lessor.  The TO coordinates contractor pick-up from the installation and updates JCM accordingly. 12.5.  Container Inspection & Maintenance Management. 12.5.1.  Program Managers and units who purchase or own ISO containers are responsible to arrange, budget, and fund for repair of their containers through an authorized repair facility or service.  Use DoD repair facilities in lieu of commercial facilities where economically feasible.  Consider new procurement or leasing as an alternative to round-trip shipping and repair costs, prior to scheduling any repairs. 12.5.2.  IAW 49 CFR, Part 452, Examination of Containers, ISO containers are examined for serviceability by certified school-trained and appointed inspectors every 30 months from the fifth  year  from  the  date  of  manufacture,  or  after  any  major  repairs  to  meet  CSC/46  U.S.C. Chapter 805 or IMDG standards.  Certified DoD or contractor personnel perform inspections and re-inspections according to MIL-STD-3037 IAW DTR Part VI, Chapter 604. 12.5.3.  CCO(s) obtain school-trained CSC inspection certification by successfully completing the  Container  Re-inspection  Course,  NOSSA-CSCCR-AMMO43-1.0,  located  on  the  U.S. Navy E-learning web site at:  https://www.aas.prod.nel.training.navy.mil/.  This course is designed to provide DoD CSC inspectors with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to properly re-inspect intermodal dry cargo containers IAW the CSC standards.  CSC inspectors are re-certified every 48-months.  Note: Refer to AF Intermodal Container Management SharePoint® Site for step-by-step instructions on how to register for this course. implements  a  CSC  re-inspection  schedule  at 12.5.4.  The  TO  develops  and the installation/activity for all overdue ISO containers.  The installation/activity CCO(s) conducts the CSC re-inspections based upon the inspection schedule and upload supporting documents (e-mail traffic, ISO container inspection checklist, DA Form 2404, Equipment Inspection and Maintenance  Worksheet)  and  supporting  photos  to  the  container  record  in  ACAMS.    The installation/activity CCO(s) seeks ISO disposition instructions from the AF Container Manager if  the  container  fails  CSC  re-inspection.    CCO(s)  request  CSC  DD  Form  2282  decals,  data strips  and  inspect/repair  ISO  containers  IAW  DTR  Part  VI,  Chapter  604.

Introduction.  This chapter outlines procedures for supporting Contracting Officers (COs) responsible  for  processing  purchase  requests  (PR)  e.g.  AF  Form  9,  Request  for  Purchase,  the Agency/Organization Program Coordinator (A/OPC), and GPC holders.  The A/OPC, also referred to as the GPC Program Manager, is responsible for operation and management of the installation’s GPC program.  Note: For further guidance on making GPC purchases, refer to AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-Wide Purchase Card (GPC) Program, Chapter 3. (T-1). 13.2.  Training.  IAW  AFI  64-117,  transportation  training  is  required  for  prospective  A/OPCs, Alternate  A/OPCs,  Approving  Officials  (AOs),  Alternate  AOs,  and  cardholders.    The  A/OPC should notify the TO when GPC initial and refresher training is scheduled for the installation. (T-1). 13.3.  Traffic  Management  and  Guidance.  Multiple  DoD,  Departmental,  and  civilian  agency directives  provide  Traffic  Management  guidance  pertaining  to  contracting  support.    TOs  shall actively support and provide essential transportation distribution training to the designated CO(s) and GPC Program  Manager(s),  as well as  cargo  movement  support for  government  contractors when required.  (T-1).  This  aides in  proper mode selection and ensure contracting officers  and GPC  cardholders  provide  commercial  vendors  with  detailed  packaging  and  transportation instructions  in  contract  solicitation(s)  and/or  GPC  card  procurement(s).    The  TO  will  have  a working knowledge of the following guidance (T-0): 13.3.1.  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Parts 8, 12, 13, 42, 47 and 52.  Visit the FAR website. 13.3.2.  DoD FAR Supplement. 13.3.3.  Air Force FAR Supplement. 13.3.4.  Title 49, CFR, Transportation. 13.3.5.  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)/IATA. 13.3.6.  International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code. 13.3.7.  DoD 4500.9-R, DTR Part II. 13.3.8.  MIL-STD-129 and MIL-STD-2073-1. 13.3.9.  AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management. 13.3.10.  AFI 64-117. 13.3.11.  AFMAN 16-101, International Affairs and Security Assistance Management. 13.3.12.  AFMAN 24-204 13.4.  FAR Contracting Support  .   It is  vital  the TO  and  contracting officer build a  cohesive relationship to develop solicitation language for cargo movement contracts.  In order to achieve the  most  efficient  transportation  support  that  is  simultaneously  most  advantageous  to  the government, the SOW should at a minimum require the following: 102 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 13.4.1.  Compliance.  Personnel  comply  with  procedures  and  guidance  in  DoD  4500.9-R (DTR), Parts I-VII; perform traffic management functions IAW this instruction; pack materiel IAW AFAMN 24-206 and AFMAN 24-210; and follow procedures in DoDM 4140.01-V5 for materiel receipt. 13.4.2.  Experienced Technicians.  Personnel should have a minimum of 2 years documented experience  working  in  traffic  management.  The  preferred  skillset  includes;  2T0X1,  Traffic Management;  3112,  Traffic  Management  Specialist;  88N,  Transportation  Management Coordinator; or GS-2130, Traffic Management Specialist. 13.4.3.  HAZMAT Preparers/Certifiers.  Personnel should be officially trained and quailed to  pack  hazardous  material  and  certify  the  SDDG  via  all  modes  IAW  the  governing publication: 49 CFR, AFMAN 24-204, IATA and IMDG. 13.4.4.  The  Use of CMOS.  Maximize use of CMOS as the Automated Information System in concert with a suite of Automatic Identification Technology devices to speed the exchange of DTR data and facilitate total asset visibility. 13.4.5.  If a shipping  activity desires a  FAR transportation contract,  then  it can request  that USTRANSCOM establish a contract.  Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 201. 13.4.6.  The  TO  should  evaluate  prospective  contractor  offers  to  assist  the  Procuring Contracting Officer in obtaining the most economical and responsive transportation service for the AF customer. 13.5.  FAR transportation procurement.  The TO will support the procurement by providing the contracting officer with the transportation factors required for solicitation. (T-0).   DoD activities will use best commercial practices and streamline “best-value” acquisition processes and include performance-based specifications when acquiring transportation services. (T-0).  At a minimum contracts will include the following instruction: all shipments must comply with ITV requirements and send data to IGC via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) using American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X12 codes, comply with DoD AIT standard marks as identified in the DTR and MIL-STD-129, packaging IAW DoDM 4140.01-V9, and preclear all export OCONUS shipments entering the DTS using an ATCMD through the sponsoring ACA or OCAA. (T-0).  Refer to DTR, Part II, Chapter 201. 13.5.1.  Depot-level Reparable Shipments. CO’s arrange or contract door-to-door commercial express TSP movement with the contractor source as part of the process to support depot-level reparable shipments. This policy supports Agile Logistics principles. (T-2). 13.5.2.  Specific  contract  language  varies  depending  on  the  delivery  terms  stated  in  the contract, e.g. where government ownership occurs Free on Board (FOB). 13.5.2.1.  Early  government  ownership  begins  at  FOB  origin,  CCP,  or  Aerial  Port  of Embarkation  (APOE),  and  drives  transportation  clauses  in  the  contract  to  mirror  DoD shipments and require DTR documentation and MIL-STD labeling and marking. 13.5.2.2.  Direct  vendor  delivery  (DVD)  contracts  (FOB  destination,  prepay  and  GPC), have no actual commercial need for military standards-based documentation and marking. However, it is necessary to establish a minimum set of requirements for these shipments in order  to:  1)  ensure  proper  processing  at  destination  Supply  Support  Activity  (SSA),  2) AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 103 integrate DVD shipments directly into the DTS in the event of crisis or contingency, or 3) generally support DoD ITV requirements. Refer DTR Part II, Chapter 201 (T-0). 13.5.2.3.  FMS procurements are FOB origin.  The shipment of the material is dictated by the terms and conditions of the FMS case. 13.6.  Assistance to Contracting and GPC Program Manager/Cardholders. 13.6.1.  The TO assists the contracting officer/GPC Program  Manager and/or cardholder by providing detailed packaging, labeling, transportation mode, method, funding, customs import duties and/or advance clearance instructions that are most advantageous to the government, to include submitting all shipments requiring AMC Channel movement for airlift clearance and providing proper Military Shipping Labels (MSLs) and Advanced Transportation Control and Movement Documents (ATCMDs) to the GPC Cardholder or CO as applicable. 13.6.2.  The  CO  establishes  the  best  possible  contractual  instrument  that  clearly  defines transportation  requirements  to  include  transportation  mode/method/documentation  and payments based on the advice of the TO. 13.6.3.  Ordering unit is responsible for all transportation costs (including, but not limited to, commercial,  AMC,  MSC, and SDDC), items  purchased with  O&M funds using  a Purchase Request  (PR)  or  GPC  purchases,  are  the  responsibility  of  the  ordering  unit.  The  cost  of transportation should be included as part of the contract/purchase price. See Chapter 5 of this for guidance in establishing funding. 13.6.4.  Use of USPS and small package TSPs via the door-to-door delivery method from the vendor to the ultimate commercial address of the customer are the preferred mode/method for shipping. shipments  must packaging,  marking, 13.6.5.  OCONUS advanced/documentation  clearance,  and  destination  host  nation  customs  clearance requirements IAW the DTR Part II and Part V. (T-0).  For sample procedure letters, vendor shipping instructions, and TCN/TAC rosters, see the Cargo Movement SharePoint®. comply  with all 13.6.6.  Shipping options listed below assist TOs in providing sound advice to their installation CO: 13.6.6.1.  First  Option:    Except  as  directed  to  acquire  supplies  in  accordance  with  FAR 8.002,  Priorities  for  Use  of  Government  Supply  Sources,  and  mandatory  use  policies, cardholders should consider transportation costs in the total acquisition cost of supplies. Items  purchased  locally  may  result  in  significant  cost  avoidance  when  compared  to purchasing  from  CONUS  sources  when  shipping  costs  are  considered.  Overseas  bases should check for in-theater GSA stores. The GSA Global Supply Ordering Guide lists all the at https://www.gsaglobalsupply.gsa.gov/advantage/main/start_page.do?store=FSS. Supply Global GSA Stores 13.6.6.2.  Second Option:  For items purchased within the CONUS, determine if the cargo is small enough for shipment with the USPS, the most economical mode of shipment. 13.6.6.2.1.  Ship  packages  prepaid  parcel  post  to  the  unit’s  official  APO  mailing address. The maximum USPS weight and size limits are 70 pounds/108 inches in length and  girth  combined  for  Priority  (7-10  day  transit  time),  and  70  pounds/130  inches length and girth for Parcel Post (10-20 day transit time). 104 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 13.6.6.2.2.  Return receipt (certified or registered), is recommended for traceability. 13.6.6.3.  Third Option:  The customer may choose to ship via a small package TSP via FOB Destination terms to the ultimate commercial overseas address. Funding Contractor Prepaid Shipping should be all inclusive in the contract verbiage or must be paid with the GPC. (T-1). Installation O&M funds are used on an FOB origin basis for transportation requirements. 13.6.6.3.1.  Shipments of prepaid shipments that are within size and weight limitations of  a  small  package  TSP  must  move  by  the  least  costly  TSP  based  on  mission requirements. (T-1).  List any direct charge for prepaid cost as a separate item on the invoice for the supplies shipped. 13.6.6.3.2.  Submit a copy of the transportation or freight bill with the invoice for cost verification. Failure to provide a copy of the paid freight bill may result in the contractor not being fully reimbursed for freight charges.  Note: For additional guidance, refer to FAR 42.1401-1(a) and FAR 42.1404-1(d). 13.6.6.4.  Fourth Option:  If the shipment moves between CONUS and OCONUS  using AMC,  MSC,  or  SDDC  port  handling  services,  the  ordering  unit’s  base  TO  assists cardholders by providing information on customs clearance, packaging, marking and DTR Part  II,  documentation  and  advance  clearance  requirements.    Special  Clauses  under  the FAR Part 12 are required to be used when shipment is to be performed through other than commercial transportation, such as the DTS. Do not make shipments without contacting the TO. 13.6.6.4.1.  An individual TAC associated with the purchaser’s funding (SDN/MORD) must  be  established  to  pay  for  transportation  charges,  e.g.  port  handling  and transoceanic movement, for any cargo moving through the DTS. (T-0).  See Chapter 5. 13.6.6.4.2.  Shipments  not  within  size  and  weight  limitations:  Provide  pertinent transportation  information  to  the  distribution  section  at  the  installation.    Units  must provide funding for cargo to be shipped to the port of entry (POE). (T-1).  Additionally, the unit is responsible to ship cargo prepaid by surface ground transportation and add the costs as a separate billing item to the invoice to the CCP or port, for entry into the DTS.    Annotate  the  bill  of  lading  "Transportation  under  this  tender  is  for  the  U.S. Department of Defense and the actual total transportation charges paid to the TSP(s) by  the  consignor  or  consignee  are  assignable  to  and  are  to  be  reimbursed  by  the Government."  Also, describe the freight on the bill of lading using the Harmonized Code  found  at:  http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/bychapter/index.htm/,  to  determine the  most  descriptive  nomenclature  based  on,  NSN,  part  number,  and  other  data presented by supply activity or vendor.  Provide a copy of the paid freight bill with the invoice.    Failure  to  properly  annotate  the  bill  of  lading,  failure  to  use  low-cost  TSP provided or approved by the TO, or failure to provide a copy of the paid freight bill could  result  in  the  contractor  not  being  fully  reimbursed  for  freight  charges.    Note: Outsized cargo: CO’s contact TO at least 5 workdays prior to movement on less-than-truckload quantities (under 10,000 pounds) and 14 days prior to shipment on truckload quantities (10,000 pounds or more).  Upon request, contractors must submit a DD Form AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 105 1659,  Application  for  U.S.  Government  Shipping  Documentation/Instructions  to  the cognizant TO. (T-1). 13.6.6.4.3.  Once  shipping  requests  are  received  by  the  installation  TO,  process  the documentation and assist the unit in clearance of cargo through the DTS POE.  The unit/shipper  is  required  to  send  all  the  documentation  to  the  vendor  by  any  means possible  (e.g.  Facsimile,  scan  and  e-mail  or  postal).  Once  the  vendors  receive  the documentation, they must follow the instructions for packaging, marking, and labeling. Guidance for uniform military marking requirements for shipment and storage is found in  MIL-STD-129,  and  guidance  for  determining  the  applicability  of  commercial  or military packaging is found in MIL-STD-2073-1. (T-0). 13.6.6.4.4.  For Shipments destined for AMC terminals (e.g. McGuire or Travis), CO’s require  contracts  to  include,  in  Section  D  “Packaging  &  Marking”  or  Section  F “Deliveries”  of  the  Contract,”  the  requirement  to  transmit  advance  shipping information  electronically  in  formats  capable  of  interfacing  with  DoD  data  systems. Units plan their contracting/GPC purchases accordingly. These procedures are required to ensure property is identified correctly and delivered to the customer without delay. 13.6.7.  Units are required to obtain approval from the Hazardous Materials Pharmacy before making any hazardous material purchases, refer to AFI 32-7086.  Once approved, the vendor is responsible for completion of the Shipper Certification to the port of entry, in addition to the international  transportation  mode  (e.g.  a  shipping  paper,  49  CFR,  as  well  as  a  hazardous declaration or Multi-modal declaration (AFMAN 24-204, IATA/ICAO, or IMDG).  Federal and  military  regulations  require  the  shipper  to  certify  that  hazardous  materials  are  properly identified, described, packaged, marked, labeled, and in proper condition  for transportation. Depending on the mode/method or whether the shipment moves by commercial or by military transportation, the specific language may vary and specific forms may be prescribed. (T-0). 13.7.  NWRM  Movement  Reporting  Requirement  for  Performance  Work  Statement (PWS).  Organizations  developing  requirements  documents  for  the  shipment  of  NWRM  shall follow DTR, Part II, and include the following paragraphs in all performance work statements or statements of work. (T-0). 13.7.1.  Outbound Shipments. 13.7.1.1.  Report  of  Shipment  (REPSHIP).  The  contractor  shall  send  a  REPSHIP  to  the destination  TO  IAW  FAR  52.247-68  and  DTR  Part  II,  Chapter  204.    For  NWRM,  the contractor shall complete the following additional actions: (1) Confirm consignee receipt of REPSHIP; (2) Record the date/time and name of consignee POC when confirmation is complete  and  maintain  with  the  consignor  copy  of  shipping  papers;  and,  (3)  Confirm consignee receipt of shipment (by telephone call or TSP delivery transaction) and maintain the confirmation with the consignor copy of shipping papers. (T-0). 13.7.1.2.  NWRM E-mail. Within two hours (for CONUS) and eight hours (for OCONUS) of  shipment  departure,  the  contractor  shall  send  an  e-mail  to  the  origin  and  destination NWRMAO/MASO  organizational receiving,  635 SCOW/NTCC, and the IM.

General.  ITV is the ability to track the identity, status, and location of DoD unit and non-unit cargo  from  origin  to destination.   It  is  critical  to  effective decision  making  concerning the disposition  of inbound  cargo and analysis of distribution pipeline performance.  The  Integrated Data  Environment  (IDE)/Global  Transportation  Network  (GTN)  Convergence  (IGC)  has  been designated the single authoritative source for ITV information.    (T-0).  The primary sources of IGC’s ITV data are the AISs supporting DoD and commercial transportation nodes. AIT enablers are tools used to enhance ITV, either through improving the speed and accuracy of processing and reporting cargo at distribution nodes or augmenting nodal information with positional data while the cargo is in route. 15.2.  ITV Process. 15.2.1.  The AF goal is to have ITV on all shipments. Shipping activities use CMOS to receipt both  originating  and  terminating  cargo  and  to  prepare/release  movement  documentation. Accomplish receipt in real time and release movement documents as soon as possible, but not later  than  1  hour  following  TSP  departure.  In  the  event  CMOS  is  temporarily  unavailable, shippers should use an alternate TSP or DoD shipping system. 15.2.2.  For unit cargo, AF shippers query IGC within 1-hour of TSP departure to validate ITV transaction has been received. If data is not present or incorrect, or if assistance is  required after trouble shooting locally to ensure the communications and transactions were transmitted, the shipper contacts the IGC help desk via e-mail or DSN 576-6836, commercial (618) 256-6836. In the event a manual air manifest is produced, the shipper sends a fax or e-mail copy to HQ AMC/A4TCI. (T-1). 15.3.  Bar Coding Requirements.  Transportation activities use bar coded DD Form 1348-1A and Military Shipment Labels (MSLs) to facilitate cargo receipt and processing. Bar coding on the DD Form  1348-1A  can  be  used  to  receive  cargo  from  materiel  management,  build  consolidated shipments,  and  process  inbound  receipts.  If  pre-positioned  data  has  not  been  provided,  the  bar coded information can be used to initiate creation of an inbound record. At in-transit points, bar code  information  on  the  MSL  can  be  used  to  populate  data  in  CMOS  or  GATES.  To  support reading/writing bar-coded labels, transportation activities maintain (1) capability to produce bar coded  MSLs  (printers,  label  stock)  and  (2)  HHTs/wedge  readers  to  support  cargo  processing activities. (T-1).  15.4.  Active RFID (aRFID) Requirements.  Transportation activities will use aRFID to support COCOM visibility requirements IAW DTR Part II, Chapter 208. (T-0). 15.4.1.  Unit move shipments. Active RFID tags are affixed to unit move pallets, containers and major end items (e.g. rolling stock, engines, pods, propellers) moving to/from OCONUS locations  or  moving  in  CONUS  in  support  of  NORTHCOM  deployments.  To  support reading/writing aRFID, AF shippers: 15.4.1.1.  Affixed tags IAW MIL-STD-129. 15.4.1.2.  Apply a single tag per cargo increment. 110 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 15.4.1.3.  Tag  deploying  vehicles  and  major  end  items  at  origin.  Origin  tags  463L  air pallets built locally. If cargo is sent to a consolidation point or port for aggregation, origin is not required to tag cargo. 15.4.1.4.  Ensure aRFID write devices (docking stations (Savi SMR 650) and/or USB write cables) are registered with J-AIT.  The CMOS RFID registration guide can be found on at https://extranet.gunter.af.mil/il/ilr/ilrc/.  Note: When a write device is moved (between outbound freight and the CDF, for example) it is re-registered. 15.4.1.5.  Budget for maintenance and replacement of write devices. 15.4.1.6.  TOs  budget,  order  and  maintain  sufficient  tags  to  support  local  exercise, deployment,  training  and  inspection  requirements  as  determined  by  the  Installation Deployment  Officer  (IDO).    Tags  may  be  ordered  through  Materiel  Management  (base supply).    Active  RFID  tags  may  also  be  purchased  directly  through  the  AMIS  RFID contract. 15.4.1.7.  Installations  will  budget  and  order  tags  to  support  originating  Air  Force  unit deployments. (T-1). 15.4.1.7.1.  Determine total tag requirement for deployment. 15.4.1.7.2.  Order  tags  no  earlier  than  45  calendar  days  prior  to  the  projected deployment date. 15.4.1.7.3.  Account for aRFID tags during deployment planning and execution. 15.4.1.7.4.  Ensure  adequate  time  is  built  into  the  deployment  schedule  of  events  to allow tags to be properly affixed to deploying cargo at the cargo deployment function. 15.4.1.7.5.  Establish local procedures to receive, store and maintain tags received at origin. 15.4.1.8.  At deployed locations, establish local procedures to recover, store and maintain tags in working order. 15.4.1.9.  At deployed locations apply tags to deploying/redeploying cargo. 15.4.1.10.  Collect tags upon redeployment to home station and store for reutilization. 15.4.2.  Sustainment  shipments.    Transportation  activities  tag  originating  463L  pallet  loads, containers and major end items shipped to, from and between overseas locations.  To support reading/writing aRFID, transportation activities: 15.4.2.1.  Affixed tags IAW MIL-STD-129. 15.4.2.2.  Apply tags to the highest level of consolidation done at the installation level (e.g. if you place a major end item in a container, only tag the container). 15.4.2.3.  If cargo is sent to an in-transit point or port for aggregation or containerization, origin is not required to tag cargo. 15.4.2.4.  Ensure  aRFID  write  devices  are  registered  with  J-AIT.  The  CMOS  RFID registration  guide  can  be  found  at  https://extranet.gunter.af.mil/il/ilr/ilrc/.    Note:  If  a write device is moved, it is re-registered. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 111 15.4.2.4.1.  Budget  for,  order  and  maintain  tags  and  batteries  to  meet  sustainment requirements.  See paragraph 15.4.1.6 for tag ordering process. On-hand requirements are established locally, but should be no less than a 3-months average volume. 15.4.2.4.2.  Budget for maintenance and replacement of write devices. 15.4.2.5.  Ensure  tag  batteries/tags  are  operational  prior  to  use  and  turned  off  while  in storage. 15.4.2.6.  Establish procedures to receive, store and maintain tags received at origin. 15.4.2.7.  Establish procedures for recovery and reutilization of aRFID tags. 15.4.3.  CMOS supports the license plate tag commission process similar to the data-rich tag write process except shipment data is not written to tag memory. 112 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 Chapter 16 OTHER CARGO MOVEMENT INFORMATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS 16.1.  Shipment of Human Remains.  Procedures to support the shipment and transfer of human remains are provided in DTR, Part VII, AFI 34-501, Mortuary Affairs Program, Chapter 5; AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement, Paragraph 3.22., and AMCI 24-101, Volume 11, Cargo and Mail Policy, Section F, Paragraph 41. 16.2.  SAAM Requests.  For SAAM request guidance, formats, and instructions, see DTR, Part II, Appendix , SAAM REQUEST. 16.3.  Public Highway Movements.  The TO is the installation focal point for ensuring that Air Force cargo moving over public highways conforms to Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances relating to vehicle size and weight limitations.  Except as shown in the DTR, Part II, and Part III, vehicular movements over public highways must have required permits issued by State authorities. (T-0). 16.3.1.  Directory of Permit Officials.  TOs maintain a copy of SDDCTEA's The Directory of Highway Permit Officials and Mobilization Movement Control Coordinators (MOBCON).  It contains contact information for state permit officials and a summary of state size and weight limits.    SDDC  Transportation  Engineering  Agency  (SDDC-SDTE),  1  Soldier  Way,  Bldg. 1900W, Scott AFB,  IL,  62225, publishes and issues this directory.  Access  the directory at SDDC TEA website. 16.3.2.  Military Cargo Essential to National Military Strategy.  Occasionally, certain highway movements  require  certification,  as  “National  Military  Strategy"  due  to  mission  needs  as prescribed in DoDM 4140.01-V1.  This certification normally applies to essential cargo that has size or weight restrictions, which moves over the public highway because the cargo cannot move by another mode.  Certification for this type of movement depends on whether movement is via commercial TSPs or military resources. 16.3.2.1.  For  certification  for  movement  via  commercial  TSP,  refer  to  DTR,  Part  II, Chapter 201, and submit certification in accordance with the rate tender.  Justification of essentiality  should  be  generated  by  the  shipping  activity  and  submitted  to  the  TO.  If necessary,  TOs  may  request  assistance  from  SDDC  Deployment  Support  Command  or theater Combatant Commander. 16.3.2.2.  For certification of movement via organic military resources, see DTR, Part III, Chapter 303, DEPLOYMENT.  Justification of essentiality is generated by the shipping activity and submitted to the TO.  For further guidance, see DTR, Part III, Appendix F, PERMITS, and SDDCTEA‘s Directory of Highway Permit and MOBCON Officials. 16.4.  Other Administrative Requirements. 16.4.1.

Notify  the  office  of  responsibility  in  paragraph A9.2.2 when inspection is required. A9.3.2.2.  Discrepancies.  Limited inspectors attempt to resolve discrepancies within IC. A9.3.2.2.1.  Limited Inspector Duties.  Personnel  will validate the TCN on the MSL corresponds to the due-in document number on the source document; verify materiel received  matches  the  source  document:  NSN,  unit  of  issue,  quantity  and  condition; submit SDRs for discrepancies discovered within IC; identify shelf-life items for base POC; and segregate hazardous materials. (T-1). A9.3.2.2.2.  Notify the office of responsibility in  paragraph A9.2.2 of all unresolved discrepancies and that further action is required by a fully qualified inspector. A9.3.2.3.  Electronic counting scales for large quantity  receipts (e.g. nuts,  bolts, screws, etc.) may be used at the discretion of the TO. A9.3.3.  Due-in  Document  Number.    The  requisition  number  on  the  source  document, including the suffix code if one is present, is used to process the receipt.  The input contains the same suffix code that appears on the shipping document to ensure status details are updated properly.   If a reject occurs because no due-in detail record exists, see paragraph A9.11 for further guidance.  Note: Due-in document number and suffix code are located in positions 30-43 and 44, receptively, on the DD Form 1348-1A. 150 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 A9.3.3.1.  For shipments where the requisition number is obliterated or source document is  lost,  move  the  property  to  a  frustrated  hold  area.    See  paragraph  A9.9  for  further guidance. A9.3.4.  Validate Routing Identifier Code (RIC).  Validate the RIC on the source document against the REC input.  If the RIC on the REC inquiry is different from the source document, contact the office of responsibility in paragraph A9.2.2 for research and base level records to determine the appropriate RIC to be used.  Ensure guidance is provided on appropriate RIC when directed to process a “J-receipt.”  Note: The RIC is located in positions 4-6 on the DD Form 1348-1A. A9.3.5.  Priority  Receipts.    Cargo  is  segregated  and  processed  by  priority,  see  Table  3.1.  Priority receipts (designator 01-03) should processed ahead of routine receipts, execute receipt transactions  through  the  ES-S  application.    See  paragraph  A9.4  for  input  format  and  entry requirements for the receipt transaction.  The in-checker signs block 22 of the DD Form 1348-1A to validate the correctness of the transaction.  Note: The priority designator is located in positions 60-61 of the DD Form 1348-1A. A9.4.  Receipt (REC) Input Transaction. A9.4.1.  Input  Restrictions.    The  screens  used  for  receipt  processing  through  the  ES-S application, see Table A9.1. Table A9.1.  Receipt Processing Screens. A9.4.2.  Input  Format  and  Entry  Requirements.

The RIC is entered for receipt not due in (J in position 52) receipts before being input as identified in the following subparagraphs. a.  For lateral support transfers:  If a nonSMAG activity is involved, use routing identifier code JLS; for SMAG to SMAG activities, use the appropriate D(xx) routing identifier code. b.  When base funded property is received from sources other than Air Force activities, DoD agencies, GSA, or commercial vendors, use JBW. c.  MRSP/MSK receipts contain the D(xx) series routing identifier code of the losing base. d.  If any of the following conditions exist see Note 7 for directions on completing the Supplementary Address Field: (1)  No routing identifier code exists for the shipping source. (2)  The REC input contains routing identifier code JLS, JBW, or MSK. (3)  The REC input contains a receipt not duein flag (J) in position 52 and a J(nn) or D(xx) routing identifier code in position 46. Supply Condition Code and Transaction Exception Code.  Leave blank unless supply condition code F, G, H, J, K, or L apply.  Supply condition code H is used for receipt of condemned XB3 assets.   a.  When unserviceable receipts are processed with TEX Code 1, then an unserviceable status code of D and the current date (date reported) are assigned to the unserviceable detail.  This indicates the item was reported on SF Form 364.   b.  When TEX Code 1 is not used on unserviceable receipts, an unserviceable status code H is assigned to the unserviceable detail.  The code H indicates that SF Form 364 has not been submitted. c.  When the REC input is output because of DWA input processing, position 7 contains the supply condition code. d.  RAR receipts are processed as serviceable. Contact EAE. 152 NOTE 3 NOTE 4 NOTE 5 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 Unit of Issue.  Enter the same Unit of Issue that appears in the receiving document.  If the receipt is for a substitute item with a Unit of Issue different from that contained in the due-in detail record, internal edits are performed to determine if the receipt can be processed by converting the input Unit of Issue.  Any of the following conditions prevents conversion and cause output of a 329 reject: a.  The Unit of Issue conversion record does not contain the change-from or change-to Unit of Issue. b.  The converted input quantity is greater than the due-in detail quantity. c.  The input contains a quantity variance flag of S or O in position 65. d.  The input stock number differs from the local purchase status detail stock number; or the input quantity is greater than the local purchase status detail quantity. e.  A BNR is loaded for the due-in document number with a Unit of Issue other than that received; however, if a BNR detail is on file for the quantity and Unit of Issue received, the input will process. Suffix Code.  When processing partial receipts, be sure this column contains the suffix code that appears on the receiving document.  This does not apply to local purchase receipts.  When processing a receipt against a push due-in, a suffix code of Z is entered in input position 44. Supplementary Address.  This field is a multiple purpose field used by A&F programs to update financial data.  Do not use this field for optional data.  The supplementary address contains the following data, as required:  When type organization code is D and receipt is for a reparable item, positions 4550 contains correct cost data.  Positions 4550 of receipt input correspond to positions 4450 of cost data.  a.  If the REC is for a manufactured item, the supplementary address contains the organization and shop code of the manufacturing organization. b.  Complete the supplementary address field (positions 4550) with the Stock Record Account Number (SRAN) of the shipping base when any of the following conditions exist: (1)  No routing identifier code exists for the shipping source.  If no account number exists, enter the service code and five zeros. (2)  The REC input contains routing identifier code D (xx), JLS, JBW, or MSK. (3)  The REC input contains a receipt not due-in flag (J) in position 52 and a J (nn) or D (xx) routing identifier code in position 46. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 153 NOTE 6 NOTE 7 NOTE 8 NOTE 9 NOTE 10 NOTE 11 Unit Price.  If the REC input results in a 373 reject, enter the unit price on the receiving document into positions 74-80 of the REC input and re-input.  If a BNR or CR detail exists, the computer automatically computes a unit price from the extended price on the detail and inserts it in positions 74-80 of the REC input.  Do not use the item record unit price or any extended prices.  The following logic applies when program control determines the input REC contains the unit price: a.  The receipt input is for a local manufacture item other than budget code Z. b.  The due-in is funded (signal code A and fund code 6C), the item record routing identifier code is JB(x) (local purchase), and the due-in detail contains a routing identifier code other than JB(x) (that is, AFMC/OSSF/DLA/GSA).  This action requires care because it changes the item record unit price. MICAP Termination/DueOut Release Data and MICAP Hour Code.  If input is degraded operations (TEX 6 or Y), enter the last three positions of Julian date in positions 57-59.  This date is the DueOut Release date and/or MICAP termination date.  If the due-out has an UND beginning with 1, /, or J (MICAP), enter the one-position hour code in position 53  Discrepancy/Replacement Code.  Local purchase final/partial flag (F = final or P = partial).  Quantity Variance Flag P or F are required only when a quantity variance is authorized on the local purchase status detail.  Otherwise, this field may be left blank, and a P or F is assigned internally under program control.  If a Replacement Flag R is in this position, insert the appropriate local purchase final/partial flag, or leave blank.  The Replacement Flag R is used when the item is replaced due to damage wrong item, etc. Multiple purpose field.  Enter data under the following conditions: a.  When an overage, shortage, or excess receipt is involved, enter quantity in positions 60-64 and quantity variance flag in position 65.  When used for this purpose, the input cannot contain TEX codes 2, 6, or Y. b.  To force release a specific due-out, enter the dueout document number in positions 6073 and TEX code 2, 6, or Y in position 51of the PostPost REC screen.  MICAP due-ins are released to the mark-for due-outs only.  Do not use TEX Code 2, 6, or Y to release higher priority MICAP dueouts. c.  For degraded operations reparable (MSI) processing, enter a TEX code 6 in position 51, and a C activity document number in positions 6073. d.   For non-local purchase overage receipts, enter an O in position 65. Tote Box/ Hold Bay.  Tote boxes and hold bays are identified by threedigit A/N designators. AFI 23-123, V1, Table 2.111 Transaction Identification Code (TRIC) Sequence authorized TEX Codes. 154 NOTE 12 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 This is the unit Moving Average Cost - not the extended cost for budget code 9 lateral support receipts.  For budget code 9 lateral shipments when the moving average cost for one unit exceeds 99,999.99 the unit price field will be blank and the unit moving average cost will appear in Block 1 (Total Price).  This does not apply to lateral receipts for budget codes 8 or Alpha.  When processing a TEX code Q or U from a lateral source, enter the unit price of the received NSN to this field. A9.4.3.  Effect of Receipt Processing.  When a receipt is processed and the Due-In Detail is loaded,  any  quantity  that  may  exist  on  the  Due-In  Detail  record  is  decreased.    When  that quantity  reaches  zero,  the  record  is  deleted.    If  funded  and  the  bill  has  not  been  paid,  a Received-Not-Billed (RNB) detail record is  created in-line.  If a due-out exists for the item received, a DOR is produced.  A Notice-to-Stock is produced to bin any items that were not released to a due-out.  Note: The full quantity received could result in multiple DORs and/or a Notice-to-Stock.  Physical quantities should be matched to the documentation quantities.. A9.4.4.  Output.    Receipt  Notice  (I046  Mgt  Notice),  Receipt/Turn-In  Bin  Notice  (I102  Mgt Notice)  and/or  DOR  document  (DD  Form  1348-1A).    Print  system  outputs  using  the  Asset Management Print Queue within the ES-S application. A9.5.  After Receipt Processed.  For DORs, select materiel and forward it to the DCO temporary hold location for delivery.  For a Notice-to-Stock, forward property to the temporary hold location for warehouse personnel to pick-up and store, see paragraph A9.6.  If the input was rejected, place one  copy  of  the  reject  with  the  materiel  and  move  the  property  to  a  reject  holding  area,  see paragraph A9.11. A9.5.1.  DOR  for  On-Base  Organizations. organizations/customers located on the installation.  Refer to AFI 24-301.   DCO  delivers  materiel  on  a  DOR  to A9.5.1.1.  ES-S Asset Management (AM) Processing.  Affix the DOR ES-S AM label to the property.  IC personnel scans the Asset Management ID (AMID) on the ES-S AM label and moves the item to a temporary hold location for DCO to pick-up and deliver.  DCO personnel  scan  the  ES-S  AM  label  on  the  property,  move  the  AMID  in  ES-S,  and  then deliver the property to the customer. A9.5.1.2.  DOR Pick-up by Customer.  In cases where customers pick-up DORs at IC, the customer  must  sign  for  the  property  in  ES-S.  (T-1).    Do  not  release  property  to unauthorized customers unable to sign in the system.  Before releasing custody of property ensure the AMID shows delivered in the Audit  Trail Query and the Electronic Delivery Confirmation (1SI) has posted to the Consolidated Transaction History (CTH). A9.5.2.  DOR for Off-Site Organizations.  When a DOR to an offsite location is generated, the property  may  be  shipped  to  the  organization  unless  the  off-base  organization  has  a  pick-up service.  Send the DD Form 1348-1A for the DOR with the property to Outbound Cargo for movement.  Upon delivery of the property, the customer must sign for the DOR in  ES-S to clear the document control record (DCR).  (T-1).  Note: The customer returns a copy of the DD Form 1348-1A to LGRM. A9.5.3.  Receipt  of  Property  at  Supplementary  Address  Location.    Items  requisitioned  for direct shipment to a supplementary address and received at the supplementary location will be processed by personnel at the supplementary location. (T-1).  Personnel at the supplementary AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 155 address  will  send  the  TCN,  movement  document  number,  piece  count  and  weight  for  each shipment received so it can be in-checked into CMOS. (T-1).  See paragraph A9.7 for specific actions required to process receipts at a supplementary address location. Personnel must send the KSD to IC and LGRM for retention. (T-1). A9.6.  Notices-to-Stock. A9.6.1.  I046  Mgt  Notices  are  furnished  for  the  quantity  of  each  item  to  be  stored  in  the warehouse.  When a Notice-to-Stock is output, IC forwards property to the Asset Management Section temporary holding area for pick-up and put away.  The Asset Management Section is responsible for ensuring items are removed from IC, this includes DORs for Readiness Spares Package  (RSP)  and  Controlled  items  (i.e.  classified,  weapons,  CCI/COMSEC,  NWRM).  Immediate action must be taken to ensure items are removed by close of business each day and do not remain in IC area. (T-2). A9.6.1.1.  ES-S AM Processing.  Affix the ES-S AM Notice-to-Stock label to the property.  IC  personnel  scans  the  AMID  on  the  ES-S  label  and  move  the  property  to  a  temporary location in IC area for Asset Management Section to pick-up.  Receipts that create a Notice-to-Stock  create  a  “Put  Away”  in  ES-S.    ES-S  AM  assigns  an  AMID  to  all  “Put  Away” items and allows tracking until the “Put Away” action is accomplished by the applicable storage site. A9.6.2.  No warehouse location assigned.  Periodically, a Notice-to-Stock is received with no warehouse location.  The LRS/Accountable Officer ensures measures are taken to prevent loss or misplacement of property pending the assignment of a warehouse location.  Controlled items (i.e.,  classified,  sensitive,  weapons,  CCI/COMSEC,  NWRM)  should  be  released  to  the appropriate warehouse for immediate storage. A9.6.2.1.  ES-S AM Processing.  Affix the ES-S AM Notice-to-Stock label to the property.  IC  personnel  scan  the  AMID  on  the  ES-S  label  and  move  the  property  to  a  temporary location for the Asset Management Section. Asset Management Section scans the AMID and assigns the property a storage location and completes the put away. A9.6.3.  I046 Mgt (Receipt) Notice.  The I046 Mgt (Receipt) notice provides notification when a REC input is processed and no DOR action is requested.  TEX codes A or H overrides the print  of  this  notice  output  within  the  ES-S  application.    These  TEX  codes  are  used  when property has been binned before the materiel receipt process is complete. A9.6.3.1.  Receipt Input.  See Table A9.2. A9.6.3.2.  Output Format.  See Table A9.3.

If the input contains supply condition code F, the phrase UNSERVICEABLE is printed. b.  If the item record does not contain a warehouse location, the phrase ASGN WHSE LOC is printed. c.  I045 Management Notice.  Processing of an unserviceable receipt causes printing of an I045 Management Notice.  This notice is forwarded to LRS Customer Service for processing. When this notice is printed, print positions 60-73 of the input image contain the unserviceable detail document number.  This notice is not printed if the unserviceable item is automatically issued to maintenance for repair. d.  Substitute Stock Number.  Processing a receipt with a substitute stock number causes printing of an I036 Management Notice.  This notice is forwarded to Customer Service for processing. When the item record contains an issue exception code and the first position of the phrase contains an asterisk (*), the applicable exception phrase is printed. If the item record contains a shelf life code other than 0, this line contains the phrase DATED ITEM followed by the shelf life code. If the item record contains a controlled item code other than U, this code is printed along with the phrase SENSITIVE ITEM, PILFERABLE ITEM, OR CLASSIFIED ITEM, as applicable. When the first position of the item record type cargo code is other than Z, the applicable type cargo phrase is printed. FUNCTIONAL CHECK MAY BE REQUIRED is printed when the program control flag of the item record Functional Check Flag is on. The item record serviceable balance and the DOLT data line is printed if the item record contains a warehouse location and the REC is processed as serviceable.  This data is provided to keep warehouse personnel from assigning more than one warehouse location to an item record. A9.7.  Receive Special Types of Items/Conditions.  This section provides receipt procedures for special type items and conditions within the ILS-S and ES-S application. A9.7.1.  Classified  and  Protected  Shipments.    Handle  all  small  package  express  carrier deliveries as classified until it is verified materiel is unclassified.  Only authorized personnel are permitted to process receipt of classified materiel.  Classified materiel receipts are given priority handling at all times; verify the stock/part number on the item matches the stock/part number  on  the  source  document.    Do  not  leave  classified  materiel  unattended  except  when secured in an approved storage area.  When the controlled item code on the item record does not  correspond to  the security  classification indicated on the accompanying documentation, contact the office responsible for establishing and maintaining the identification of items.  See paragraph A9.2.2. 158 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 A9.7.2.  Consolidated Shipments.  Process a Consolidated Shipment Inquiry (1CS) on the lead TCN to obtain a list of all due-ins that should be included in the consolidated shipment.  Check off items as they are processed.  If any item with the same TCN is on the inquiry output but not  in  the  shipment,  check  all  items  in  the  shipment  to  verify  the  missing  item  was  not processed as part of another item.  If the item was not shipped, process a shortage receipt. A9.7.3.  Equipment Items.  Assets are for an accountability transfer or a receipt due-in. A9.7.3.1.  Accountability transfers (1ET).  Receipt for cargo in CMOS and release to EAE to complete FED process to properly account for receipt of equipment.  Use the CMOS Surface Freight Inbound Turnover Records to document the transfer of custody. A9.7.3.2.  Due-ins are processed by IC, see paragraph A9.3. A9.7.4.  DCAS  Contracts.    Materiel  received  on  a  DD  Form  250  or  DD  Form  1155,  and containing DCAS in either the ADMINISTERED BY block or in the PAYMENT WILL BE MADE  BY  block  is  administered  by  the  Defense  Contract  Administration  Services.    IC personnel  will  sign  the  inspection  and  acceptance  certificate  and  forward  it  to  the  contract administration Automated Data Processing point.  The report and its envelope will be stamped DESTINATION ACCEPTANCE in letters at least one half inch high. A9.7.4.1.  Damage.  If the shipping container is damaged, contact the Inspection Section for serviceability determination. A9.7.4.2.  Do  Not  Attach  with  Metal.    Documentation  must  never  be  attached  to  ESD property or packaging by use of staples or metal fasteners of any kind. (T-2). A9.7.5.  Functional Check items.  The phrase FUNCTIONAL CHECK MAY BE REQUIRED appears on line 4 or 5 of the bin notice for items that require a functional check.  IC forwards the documentation and property to the Inspection Section for further action. A9.7.6.  Local  Manufacture  Items.    IC  receipts  for  cargo  in  CMOS  by  in-checking  the movement document and associated TCN(s).  Forward a copy of the work order request to the maintenance activity.  The remaining copies of the work order request are used as a source document.    In  order  to  reduce  transportation  and  handling  costs,  the  Flight  Service  Center processes receipts for local manufacture items. Refer to AFI 23-101 Chp 3. A9.7.7.  Local  Purchase  Items.    See  paragraph  A9.8  for  the  receipt  processing  of  Local Purchase items. A9.7.8.  MICAP Requirements.  The receipt of MICAP items normally result in a DOR.  Open all  MICAP  shipments  and  physically  verify  the  stock/part  number  on  the  item  matches  the stock/part number on the shipping document and identification tags to ensure the proper item is being received.  Do not open ESD or hermetically sealed packages unless there is evidence of damage.  Where a DOR is not produced, for example, with a short receipt, substitute receipt, reject,  Notice-to-Stock,  etc.,  notify  the  Customer  Support  Liaison  Element  that  a  MICAP receipt has been processed or rejected and a corresponding DOR was not produced. A9.7.9.  Controlled Cryptographic Item Communication Security (CCI/COMSEC) Serialized Control Items.  Materiel Management Aggregation Code (MMAC) IAW DoDM 4100.39, Vol 10, Table 66; IC personnel verify the accuracy of the serial number by opening the container and  visually  inspecting  the  item  and  the  identification  tags.    The  serial  number  physically AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 159 located on the item is written accurately and clearly on the identification tags and the source document. A9.7.9.1.  SF 153, CCI/COMSEC Materiel Report.  If an asset is received from  another service  or  contractor  and  they  used  an  SF  153  as  the  shipping  document,  IC  technician checks the received square in section 14 and signs in section 15. A9.7.9.2.  In  this  case,  the  signature  represents  the  receiving  activity  rather  than  the CCI/COMSEC custodian.  After the form is signed, copies 1 and 2 forwarded to the activity indicated in block 2. A9.7.9.3.  Copy  3  is  retained  as  supporting  documentation  attached  to  the  source document. A9.7.9.4.  Controlled  Cryptographic  Item  (CCI)  assets.    An  F117  management  notice, containing related serial numbers, is produced for each transaction in conjunction with the output  source  document  (SHP,  DOR,  etc.).    Ensure  the  F117  accompanies  the  output document to Document Control. A9.7.9.5.  COMSEC Serialized Control Input (XHB).  Depending on the type phrase used, this input creates or deletes a serialized control detail (249 Record) or an in use serialized control  (250  Record),  or  modifies  either  one  in  preparation  for  subsequent  inline processing.  This format is to be used by the base level user to modify records of serialized COMSEC assets.  See Table A9.4. A9.7.9.6.  Foreign Nationals.  Foreign nationals  are authorized to store, inspect, deliver, and handle CCI assets as long as there is a US citizen present. Table A9.4.  Type Phrase and Resulting Action. Type Phrase SHIPPED  Loads a serialized control detail (249 record) prior to REC processing. Resulting Action This phrase creates a serialized control record (249 detail) reflecting the stock number, SRAN/MILSTRIP document number, and serial number when a requisition is initiated by activity and the item is received. A serialized control detail (249 record) is created for each item for subsequent REC processing. 160 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 This phrase is used to identify a specific stock number and serial number to be issued or DueOut Released from on-hand warehouse balance.  (The existing 249 record document number does not have to be changed to coincide with the requester’s document number for follow-on processing.)  This phrase is also used for shipments, transfers, and condition changes when the total on-hand quantity in the warehouse is not to be released.  The program locates and modifies a serialized control detail (249 record) based on the input stock number, document number, and serial number. If loaded the 249-ACTION-CODE is set to an ‘I’. This phrase is used to delete a specific serialized control detail (249 record) based upon the stock number, document number and serial number of the input.  If the 249-RECEIPT-CODE is equal to a blank, the record is deleted.  (To blank a 249-RECEIPT-CODE, use type phrase RVPREC.) This phrase is used for reverse post of a receipt. The program locates and modify a serialized control detail (249 record) based on the input stock number, document number, and serial number.  If loaded, the 249-RECEIPT-CODE is blanked. This phrase is used for reverse post of turn-ins.  The program locates and delete a serialized control detail (249 record) based on the input stock number, document number, serial number and if the 249-RECEIPT-CODE is equal to an ‘R’.  If the activity code in the document number being reverse posted is other than ‘X’, ‘R’, ‘J’, or ‘P’ the program creates an in-use serialized control (250 record). ISU/DOR  Prepares a serialized control detail (249 record) for issues, DueOut Releases, shipments, transfers, and condition code changes. DELETE  Deletes a serialized control record (249 detail) when the 249 RECEIPT-CODE is blank. RVPREC  Blanks the 249-RECEIPT-CODE on a serialized control detail (249 record) prior to reverse posting a REC. RVPTIN  Deletes a serialized control detail (249 record) when the 249-RECEIPT-CODE is ‘R’.  Creates an in-use serialized control detail (250 record) if the activity code of the TIN to be reverse posted is other than ‘X’, ‘R’, ‘J’, or ‘P’. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 161 A9.7.10.  Items mounted on trailers, dollies, or vans, or packaged in reusable containers (e.g. gas, acid, and vehicle-mounted communications equipment, and their containers or dollies) are processed separately. A9.7.10.1.  Receipt Due-In.  The requisitioned item is processed as a receipt due-in while the container or dolly (except for vendor owned containers) is processed as a receipt not due-in (J in position 52).  Contact the Customer Support Liaison Element for assistance to determine the appropriate routing identifier code to be used. A9.7.10.2.  Use the same document number as the one for the requisitioned item, except position 31 is changed to D.  If the container is to be regarded as an equipment item and accounted for on authorized/in-use details, Contact the Equipment Accountability Element.  Engine containers that are not accounted for on in-use detail records are accounted for by engine manager. A9.7.11.  Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel Assets.  NWRM receipts are processed using the following procedures: A9.7.11.1.  LRS/After-hours support will notify NWRM Transaction Control Cell (NTCC) or  the  Air  Force  Space  Command  Logistics  Support  Center  (AFSPC  LSC)  any  time  an NWRM asset is received. (T-1). A9.7.11.2.  The LRS IC/After-hours support will ensure only personnel authorized by the NWRMAO will process NWRM receipts. (T-1). A9.7.11.3.  The LRS IC/After-hours support will provide the NTCC or the AFSPC LSC the  NSN,  part  number,  document  number,  quantity,  Unit  of  Issue,  and  applicable  serial number(s) by official e-mail. (T-1). A9.7.11.4.  NTCC  or  the  AFSPC  LSC  and  LRS  performs  the  appropriate  research  to determine if valid requirements exist for those NWRM not shipped by normal MILSTRIP procedures.  Utilize standard requisition procedures prior to receipt processing actions. A9.7.11.5.  NTCC or the AFSPC LSC lifts the freeze code “N”, and notifies the requesting LRS IC/After-hours support that the freeze code has been removed. A9.7.11.6.  LRS  processes  the  REC.    After  successful  processing,  contact  NTCC  or  the AFSPC LSC to reload the freeze code “N”. A9.7.11.7.  Within 2 hours (CONUS) and 8 hours (OCONUS) of receipt of NWRM, the receiving LRS account uses official e-mail to notify the gaining and losing NWRMAO. A9.7.11.8.  NTCC or the AFSPC LSC updates the webpage. A9.7.12.  Supplementary Address Locations (Pinpoint deliveries).  Stock positioning decisions optimizes  the  storage  and  movement  of  materiel  to  meet  worldwide  customer  mission requirements.  Stock positioning decisions are based primarily on achieving responsive and efficient materiel distribution support. A9.7.12.1.  Aircraft  spares  with  Expendability,  Recoverability,  Reparability,  Cost Designators  (ERRCD)  of  (XD_/XF_)  are  stored  within  the  APS  to  the  greatest  extent possible.  Pinpoint delivery is recommended to redirect inbound shipments to forward stock items from IC to decentralized aircraft parts stores, and establish these warehouses as cargo receiving points. 162 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 A9.7.12.2.  Personnel  at  the  supplementary  address  are  responsible  for  and  required  to, send IC the TCN, movement document number, piece count and weight for each shipment received so it can be in-checked into CMOS. A9.7.12.3.  Receipts for items requisitioned for direct shipment to a supplementary address and received at  the alternate location by  pinpoint  personnel  will be processed  IAW this AFI. (T-1). A9.7.12.3.1.  For organization at off-base locations without personnel authorized the receipt transaction, the off-base organization provides a trained and appointed limited inspector  who  receives  the  materiel  and  forwards  the  signed  source  document confirming the identity, quantity and condition of the asset to IC for receipt input. A9.7.13.  Shelf  Life  Items.    Items  are  inspected  by  a  qualified  inspector  to  be  certain  the expiration of inspection/test date is accurate. Segregate shelf-life items within IC and notify the Asset Management Section shelf-life program POC of items requiring action. A9.7.13.1.  Identification on Labels.  Qualified inspectors make sure the label on each item, subject to shelf life management, clearly states the expiration date. A9.7.13.2.  Date Is Not Expired.  If the date is not expired, personnel sign or stamp block 27 of the DD Form 1348-1A, to verify the shelf life date on the tag/label and the paperwork are correct.  IC processes the receipt input. A9.7.13.3.  Date Is Expired.  If the inspection/test date is expired, IC personnel take the following actions: A9.7.13.3.1.  Type  I (alpha codes). Receipt expired type  I shelf-life XB3  items  with supply  condition  code  H.  Supply  condition  code  H  automatically  creates  an unserviceable  document  to  transfer  XB3  property  to  the  DLADS.  Receipt  all  other ERRCs with supply condition code F. Supply condition code F automatically requests disposition  reporting  instructions  or  creates  an  unserviceable  shipping  document,  as applicable. A9.7.13.3.2.  Type II (numeric codes). A9.7.13.3.2.1.  If the inspection/test date can be extended, a qualified inspector (not a limited inspector) extends the date.  IC then receipts the property as serviceable. A9.7.13.3.2.2.  If  the  property  requires  a  serviceability  check  by  a  technical specialist, forward property to the Inspection Section after the receipt is processed. A9.7.13.3.2.3.  If  the  inspection/test  date  cannot  be  extended,  receipt  XB3  items with supply condition code H and all other ERRCs with supply condition code F. A9.7.14.  Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO). Identify TCTO materiel in one of two ways: A9.7.14.1.  Identified  during  processing.  The  phrase  “TCTO  MODIFICATION REQUIRED” is printed on line 4 of the bin notice. A9.7.14.2.  Identified  on  Shipping  Document.    When  a  shipping  document  contains “TCTO MOD REQ'D” in block 27 of the DD Form 1348-1A, or line 16 of the DD Form 1348-1A. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 163 A9.7.14.3.  TCTO kits have a K in the fifth position of the NSN (e.g. 1560K12345678). A9.7.15.  Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services (DLADS).  Unserviceable Materiel from DLADS should be processed with routing identifier JBR; the due-in document number have J, K, or L in the first position of the requisition serial number; no TEX code; and no due-out document number.  The receipt creates an unserviceable detail and formats a force DOR with the linked due-out document number and the unserviceable document number. A9.7.16.  Warranty/Guaranty and Contract Repair Services.  Items under warranty or guaranty are identified on the containers, as required in MIL-STD-129.  This marking technique makes it  unnecessary  to  open  inbound  property  only  to  determine  whether  it  is  under warranty/guaranty.  When a copy of the warranty or guaranty is received with the property, securely attach it to the property and forward both to the Inspection Section. A9.7.17.  Individual  Protective  Equipment  (IPE).    Consolidated  Mobility  Bag  Activity (CMBA)  shipments  for  local  IPE  are  identified  by  document  series  starting  with  FB4800.  Receipt for cargo in CMOS and release to the Individual Protective Equipment Element for processing.    Use  the  CMOS  Surface  Freight  Inbound  Turnover  Records  to  document  the transfer of custody. A9.7.18.  Organizational  Refusals.    Customers  may  refuse  to  accept  an  item  because  it  is misidentified, unserviceable, damaged, unsuitable substitute and/or issued in excess quantity at time of delivery.  The customer refusing the property must annotate the DOR document with the phrase ORGANIZATION REFUSAL, give a brief explanation for refusing the property, and sign the document. (T-1). The signed document and property is returned to the Inspection Section for further processing.  The customer is responsible if the wrong item was ordered, or if the item was shipped due to a failure to cancel a due-out.  DO NOT reverse post returned items if customer ordered the wrong item. A9.7.19.  Undeliverable  DORs.    In  cases  where  DCO  is  unable  to  deliver  property, immediately notify Distribution and Materiel Management leadership and request assistance.  LRS retains the authority to process a serviceable return for undelivered DORs. A9.7.20.  Part  Number  receipts.    A  vendor-produced  invoice  is  authorized  to  be  used  as  a receipt document if it contains, at a minimum:  NSN or part number, requisition number/due-in,  price,  Unit  of  Issue,  and  quantity.    Any  resolution  to  errors  or  rejects  concerning  a  part number  receipt  are  directed  to  the  Part  Number  Cell  at  the  635th  Supply  Chain  Operations Wing (SCOW). A9.7.21.  KC-46 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Managed Items.  Parts managed by the FAA issued on a DD Form 250 (Material Inspection and receiving Report) or DD Form 1348-1A is processed as a general receipt.  Shipping documentation and outer packaging are clearly marked to identify parts and equipment under this program.  IC ensures the FAA Form 8130-3  (see  Figure  A9.1),  European  Aviation  Safety  Agency  (EASA)  Form  1,    used  by European  countries,  Transport  Canada  form  1  (TC1)  or  Certificate  of  Conformance  (CoC) accompanies the cargo.  These forms validate the certification of the part.  If the FAA Form 8130-3 and EASA Form 1 are not  present,  the part is  turned over to  the Inspection Section Chief Inspector for further action. A9.7.22.  Government Vehicles.  Upon arrive immediately notify the Vehicle Fleet Manager (VFM) or Vehicle Management Superintendent (VMS) for a compliance inspection.  Complete 164 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 cargo  receipt  IAW  A9.2.1.1  and  release  assets  to  VFM/VMS  on  a  CMOS  Surface  Freight Inbound  Turnover  Records  to  document  the  transfer  of  custody.    Vehicle  Management accounts for the assets in the ILS-S. A9.8.  Local  Purchase  Receipt.  Specific  procedures  associated  with  the  processing  of  LP receipts,  local  bulk  deliveries,  overages,  shortages,  unsuitable  substitutes,  misidentified  and unserviceable property, and transportation discrepancies are described in this section.  Procedures not covered in this section are detailed in paragraphs A9.4 or A9.9. A9.8.1.  Supporting  Documentation.    The  Standard  Procurement  System  (SPS)  is  normally used by the contracting activity to purchase items locally.  LP Notifications of Award should be used for processing local purchase receipts.  The distribution of the award document should be the same as the DD Form 1348-1A.  If SPS is not used, then IC may maintain files of DD Form  1155  or  DD  Form  1348-1A  in  purchase  order  number  sequence  until  the  property  is received. A9.8.1.1.  DD Form 1155 (Order for Supplies or Services).  DD Form 1155 is prepared by the  Base  Contracting  Office  (BCO).    A  copy  is  sent  to  IC,  except  when  Base  Purchase Agreement BPA call numbers are used.  The form should be retained until all items listed on the form have been received and processed. A9.8.1.2.  DD Form 1348-1A (Issue Release/Receipt Document).  A DD Form 1348-1A is produced when procurement status is processed on a local purchase item or a partial local purchase receipt is processed.  This form is used as the receiving document.  The output format for this document is described in Table A9.5. A9.8.1.2.1.  Output Destination.  ES-S application Asset Management Print Queue. A9.8.1.2.2.  Receipt Input see Table A9.2. Table A9.5.  Local Purchase Receiving Document Receipt Output Format.

NOTE 2  When a purchase order number change is input (TRIC EDD), the old purchase order number appears in line 2, print position 5458; and the new purchase order number is in line 3, print position 1115. A9.8.2.  LP Open Item List.  IC can use the LP Open Item List (M37/NGV997) to screen the local purchase files for errors.  IC should annotate the list with all errors (e.g. DD Form 1155 or DD Form 1348-1A missing, file folder missing or out of sequence, etc.) and forward the list to Customer Support Liaison Element for further action. A9.8.3.  Processing  LP  Receipts.    Each  line  item  received  on  the  order  should  be  printed individually on the LP Notifications of Award.  If SPS is not used, IC personnel may be able to retrieve the appropriate receiving documents from file.  If no DD Form 1348-1A is on file or  an  LP  Notification  of  Award  is  not  in  SPS,  place  the  item  in  a  hold  area  and  contact Customer Support Liaison Element to obtain the appropriate documentation. 166 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 A9.8.3.1.  Prompt Handling.  LP receipts should be processed promptly to take advantage of discounts and to avoid interest payments.  When delays cannot be avoided, IC personnel should forward copies to the FSC. A9.8.3.2.  Due-In Details Required.  LP receipts are be processed against a corresponding Due-In Detail. A9.8.3.3.  Variance Flag.  When a quantity variance is authorized on the Local Purchase Status (LPS) detail, the receipt input contains a variance flag of either P or F (to represent either a partial or final local purchase receipt) in position 54.  When no quantity variance is authorized, position 54 of the input receipt may be left blank, and a P or F is assigned under program control. A9.8.3.4.  Partial  Receipts.    When  a  partial  receipt  is  processed,  a  new  local  purchase receiving document should  be produced for the  remaining  quantity due-in.  A shipment status detail remains on file to prevent any additional shipment status images (ASx/AUx) from creating a ship status detail for the same requisition number and suffix code.  These shipment Status Ship Detail Record 211 can be identified with REC stored in the 211 DT-AV-SHPT and the date received in the 211 date of last transaction.  These details remain on file until the total due-in quantity is received. A9.8.3.5.  317  Reject.    If  the  REC  input  results  in  a  317  reject,  an  LPS  has  not  been processed.    IC  personnel  should  keep  a  copy  of  the  input  REC  and  forward  remaining copies to Customer Support Liaison Element for action. A9.8.3.5.1.  Determination  of  Priority  Status.    Customer  Support  Liaison  Element determines whether the reject relates to a priority requisition.  Check with the MICAP monitor or initiate an inquiry to determine whether degraded operations DOR action for MICAP requirements should be taken before the LPS is received.  If a degraded operations  DOR  is  warranted,  Customer  Support  prepares  it  and  gives  it  to  IC  for processing.    IC  personnel  should  enter  the  needed  DOR  data  on  the  317  reject  and prepare a degraded operations DOR document.   IC personnel  moves the  item  to  the temporary location for the Documented Cargo pick-up and delivery area. If degraded operations DOR action is not required, the asset are kept in the holding area until the LPS is input.  Note: Degraded operations DOR action may also be necessary for other priority due-out requirements as determined by Supply MAJCOM or local levels. A9.8.3.5.2.  LPS Status.  SPS bases create a follow-up, TRIC AF1 off-line, using the data from the 317 reject.  The AF1 follow-up is forwarded to the BCO for input to the SPS to generate the required LPS status.  Non-automated bases immediately contact the BCO to prepare the applicable inputs. A9.8.3.5.3.  LPS Processing.  Customer Support  Liaison Element processes the  LPS and notifies IC personnel to reprocess the receipt. A9.8.3.5.3.1.  If  degraded  operations  Due  Out  Release  action  was  taken;  IC personnel  enter  TEX  Code  6  and  the  Due  Out  Release  document  number  in positions 60-73 of the output REC and inputs it for processing. A9.8.3.5.3.2.  If  no  Due  Out  Release  action  was  required,  normal  processing  is taken. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 167 A9.8.3.6.  Receipt  documents.    Receipt  documents  for  local  purchase  are  processed  as follows: A9.8.3.6.1.  Copy  1.    After  completing  all  actions,  the  in-checker  and  Inspection Section sign the acceptance block on the DD Form 250 or DD Form 1155.  The receipt document is annotated with the in-checker's last name in block 22 and the Julian date in block 23 and with the Chief Inspector's signature or stamp and Julian date in block 27.  The Chief Inspector should Stamp the phrase “LP RECEIPT FILE COPY” on all local  purchase  receipts  in  bold  print.    After  processing,  send  the  documents  to Document Control. A9.8.3.6.2.  Copy  2.    Process  against  the  receipt  due-in  file  or  send  to  the  terminal operator for processing.  After action is completed, destroy the copy. A9.8.3.6.3.  Copy  3.    Retain  with  the  property  until  Notice-to-Stock  or  DOR  is received. A9.8.3.6.4.  Remaining copies.  Use as needed.  During extended periods of computer downtime, as determined by the LRS/Accountable Officer and the DFAS Field Site, forward an additional copy of the local purchase receiving document to the DFAS Field Site for vendor payment. A9.8.3.7.  Locally  Assigned  Stock  Number  Items.    When  a  locally  assigned  stock numbered item (L in position 5) is received, a fully qualified inspector determines if the item has a manufacturer's part number.  If a part number is available, forward one copy of the receiving document, after normal receipt processing to the Customer Support Liaison Element. A9.8.3.8.  Warranty/Guaranty.    Locally  purchased  items  under  warranty/guaranty  are identified in the purchase document. A9.8.3.9.  Processing  LP  Emergency  Walk  Through  Receipts.    Forward  LP  emergency walk through receipts to Customer Support Liaison Element. A9.8.4.  LP Variance.  LP contracts may authorize a contracting supplier to deviate from the requested quantity.  This deviation is expressed as a percent of variance of the quantity ordered.  These deviations are governed by two circumstances: they cannot exceed 10 percent, and they should  be  authorized  by  the  purchasing  contract.    When  variance  occurs,  the  percent  of variance (variance flag) and the computed quantity of variance is recorded on the LP status detail.  When the contract authorizes variance, the following processing procedures apply: A9.8.4.1.  Quantity Greater than Due-In.  If the quantity on the receipt is greater than the due-in quantity: A9.8.4.1.1.  If receipt has a BNR detail record, process the receipt.  If prior billing was for  the  quantity  originally  ordered,  the  BNR  detail  is  deleted  and  an  RNB  detail  is created for the overage quantity received.  If the variance option is used and the billed quantity  is  different  from  the  due-in  quantity,  the  due-in  is  adjusted  and  the  option variance removed (variance flag/quantity deleted). A9.8.4.1.2.  Without Billed Not Received (BNR).   Process receipt and build RNB. 168 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 A9.8.4.2.  Quantity Less than Due-In.  If the quantity on the receipt is less than the due-in quantity: A9.8.4.2.1.  If  receipt  has  a  BNR  detail  record,  process  the  receipt.  The  BNR  is decreased, the variance flag and variance quantity is deleted, and the final or partial flag is changed to P.  An I133 management notice is output for distribution and action by IC.  Since the vendor has been paid for BNR quantity, IC will prepare an SF 364 ROD/SDR and forward it to BCO for action. A9.8.4.2.2.  If the receipt has no BNR detail record, and the final quantity received is less than the due-in and no prior billing has occurred, process the receipt.  The due-in and status detail is deleted.  An RNB is created for the quantity received. A9.8.4.3.  Reject  386.    Reject  386  signals  that  a  quantity  variance  flag  is  in  error.    It  is generated when discrepancies occur on local purchase receipts. (See AFH 23-123 V2 PT2 for details.) A9.8.5.  LP Discrepancies.   IC will provide an electronic ROD/SDR (use SF 364 ROD/SDR in the absence of ES-S or WebSDR) for LP discrepancies to the BCO.  Bases may implement local procedures which use alternate notification methods, such as form letter, telecom, etc., as agreed to by the BCO and the DFAS Field Site. A9.8.6.  Process  LP  Receipts  for  Overages.    An  SF  364  ROD/SDR  is  prepared  on  all  LP overage  receipts,  except  when  LP  documentation  (DD  Form  1155,  Order  for  Supplies  or Services) is annotated with an excess quantity clause and the extended cost is less than $250. A9.8.6.1.  Excess Receipt Quantity Less than $250 with Excess Quantity Clause.  An SF 364 ROD/SDR is not required when the extended price of an excess receipt quantity is less than $250 and the LP documentation form (DD Form 1155) is annotated with an excess quantity  clause.    Customer  Support  Liaison  Element  will  process  an  off-line  Special Requisition (SPR) with an advice code 2E for the overage.  This will cause the receipt to process without creating a RNB detail. A9.8.6.2.  Excess Receipt Quantity Greater than $250 or No Excess Quantity Clause.  An SF  364  ROD/SDR  is  required  on  all  LP  receipts  with  an  overage  greater  than  $250, regardless  of  the  extended  price  when  no  excess  quantity  clause  is  included  in  the  LP documentation. A9.8.7.  Process  LP  Receipts  for  Shortages.    When  the  quantity  received  is  less  than  the quantity reflected on the LP receipt, the Inspection Section Inspector will instruct IC personnel to, process a partial receipt (P in position 54) for the quantity received, and, forwards the SF 364  ROD/SDR  to  the  BCO.    Note:  If  after  receipt,  property  is  lost  IC  will  initiate  special inventory procedures IAW AFI-23-101. A9.8.8.  Partial Unit of Issue Deliveries.  When a fraction of a Unit of Issue is received, the input quantity will depend on the percent of the fraction received.  If less than one-half of a complete Unit of Issue is received, adjust the input quantity by rounding down to the nearest whole  number.    If  half  or  more  of  a  Unit  of  Issue  is  received,  adjust  the  input  quantity  by rounding up to the next whole number.  For example:  U/I-YD, Qty received-30 1/3 yd, input Qty = 30; U/I-YD, Qty received-30 1/2 yd, input Qty = 31.  Note: Incidents like those described above are common with receipts of carpet, gravel, cement, etc. AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 169 A9.8.9.  Processing LP Receipts Received Without Invoice/Packing List.  When LP items are received  without  an  invoice  or  a  packing  list  attached  to  validate  the  materiel  shipped  and received, IC personnel will research automated or manual records to determine if the shipment is  correct  and  can  be  processed.    If  a  discrepancy  exists,  contact  the  BCO  to  determine corrective  actions  before  receipt  processing.    All  discrepancies  need  to  be  resolved  prior  to receipt processing. A9.8.10.  Unsuitable  Substitute,  Misidentified  or  Unserviceable  Property.    When  materiel received  is  an  unsuitable  substitute,  misidentified,  or  unserviceable  condition,  the  limited inspector will prepare and forward a SF 364 ROD/SDR to the BCO for disposition instructions. A9.8.11.  Receipt  of  LP  Hazardous  Material  (HAZMAT).    When  HAZMAT  is  purchased locally, Air Force regulations require that a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) be obtained to prevent the materiel  from  being  issued without sufficient information  on its safe  handling, use, and disposal methods.  Note: The SDS is treated as a deliverable item in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) when the procurement contract  specifies it is required.  The FAR and AFFARS require  the  SDS  be  mailed  to  the  base  HAZMART/Bioenvironmental  Engineering (BE)/Medical Facility. A9.8.11.1.  Receipt of HAZMAT.  Upon receipt of HAZMAT on a contract that requires a SDS, IC personnel will coordinate with the HAZMART/BE/Medical Facility to verify a SDS was received. A9.8.11.1.1.  If a HAZMAT item is received at the inbound cargo without a SDS, the property can still be received if it is to an existing inventory, process/Stock Number already  loaded  or  issued  for  the  user  that  needs  the  material.    While  there  needs  to eventually be an effort to convert existing MSDS to SDS for existing inventory, unless "new"  inventory  is  being  received,  from  Enterprise  Environment  Safety  and Occupational Health-Management Information System (EESOH-MIS)/environmental perspective  there  is  no  need  to  input  a  new  SDS.    Note:  After  the  materiel  receipt processes, HAZMAT is received through HAZMART and processed in EESOH-MIS. A9.8.11.1.2.  Discrepancy Report.   IC personnel  will initiate and forward an SF 364 ROD/SDR to BCO. A9.8.12.  LP Bulk Delivery.  Civil Engineering items such as gravel or cement and Installation Fuels Items such as liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen, and deicing fluid may be delivered directly to dispersed job sites or to Fuels Management Flight (FMF) tanks respectively. A9.8.12.1.  Civil Engineering Items.  Only technically trained Civil Engineering personnel will receive and sign for bulk items delivered to disperse job sites.  A signed copy of the receiving report should be provided to the LRS receiving activity.  IC will process a receipt as applicable.  The vendor's delivery ticket should be attached to the receiving document. A9.8.12.2.  Fuels Management Flight (FMF).  The FMF inspects, accepts, and receipts for bulk  delivery  of  liquid  oxygen,  liquid  nitrogen,  and  deicing  fluid  delivered  into  tanks.  These are FB (supply) versus FP (fuels) account items; however, the FMF serves as the receiving  agent  and  is  responsible  for  signing  all  receipt  documentation.    The LRS/Accountable  Officer  and  Fuels  personnel  will  determine  if  it  is  more  efficient  to 170 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 process the associated transactions at the FMF, or to forward the documentation to IC for processing. A9.9.  Receipt Problems. A9.9.1.  Condemned Items.  Items received in unserviceable condition and determined to be condemned by a qualified inspector, authorized to process a condition code change, will be receipt by ERRCD. (T-1). A9.9.1.1.  XB3 Items. Condition code H (condemned). A9.9.1.2.  Non XB3 items. Other than XB3, enter a condition code F (unserviceable). A9.9.2.  Damaged Shipments.  Property received in a damaged condition is placed in a "hold" status for a maximum of 90 days after transportation discrepancies are discovered or 60 days after IC has submitted the TDR/SDR to the office of final action and verification. A9.9.2.1.  Partial Shipment Damage.  When a portion of a shipment is damaged, enter the damaged quantity on a copy (not original) of the receiving document.  Alter the original document  by  changing  the  serviceable  quantity  indicated.    Using  the  same  document number, process a separate transaction for the damaged quantity extracted from the original document   TEX code P (damaged in shipment) or Z (hidden defect) is used in the input. A9.9.2.2.  Partial Unit of Issue Damage.  When a part of the Unit of Issue (e.g. BX, DZ, etc.) is damaged, process the receipt with a TEX code 8 with condition code J to prevent Due Out Release processing.  If parts of several units of issue are damaged, items can be repacked and shifted to create whole units.  If a portion of a Unit of Issue remains, forward property  to  the  Inspection  Section  for  FCH/FCC  processing.    Note:  FCC  and  FCH  are controlled  TRICs  and  not  for  use  by  IC  personnel.    Refer  to  Limit  Transaction Identification Code (TRIC) Group Assignment in AFI 23-101 Sec 7E. A9.9.3.  Different Stock Number or Unit of Issue.  If stock number or Unit of Issue differences exist between the receipt and the receiving document, a qualified inspector in the Inspection Section will validate the differences.  If the stock number and Unit of Issue on the receiving report are valid, correct the receipt input and process. A9.9.3.1.  295 Reject, Item Record Not Loaded, occurs if the receipted stock number is not in the system.  Contact Customer Support Liaison Element to load the item record. A9.9.3.2.  329 Reject, Unit of Issue Unequal or In Error.  Correct the Unit of Issue and/or quantity in ES-S.  Coordinate suspected errors with Customer Support Liaison Element for further assistance process changes, if required. A9.9.4.  Document Number Illegible.  IC personnel will prepare a receipt input with the legible information  available  (e.g.  TRIC  REC,  stock  number,  Unit  of  Issue,  and  quantity).    A document  number  is  locally  assigned  for  processing  to  produce  a  356  Reject  for  further research.    Assign  a  Document  Number  using  the  service  code,  type  account  code,  account number, current Julian date, and a serial number between 9900 and 9999. A9.9.4.1.  Serial Numbers.  Serial numbers will start with 9900 each day and be assigned sequentially as needed. A9.9.4.2.  356 Reject, Due-In Detail Not Loaded.  After assigning the serial number, input the receipt to obtain a 356 Reject.  A paper copy of the reject and supporting documentation AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 171 (e.g. TCN, DLA or GSA contract number) is forwarded to the Customer Support Liaison Element for research.  Remaining copies are attached to the property. A9.9.5.  Documentation Missing.  Items received with no source document. Open the container in an attempt to locate a copy of the shipping document. If no document is found, consult with Inspection Section to identify the item, verify the stock number/part number and create a source document  based  on  information  available.    IC  will  process  the  receipt  using  the  source document. A9.9.6.  Inventory in Progress.  When receipt action is attempted on an item that is frozen for inventory the receipt is rejected with a 469 Reject, Record of Input S/N Frozen for Complete or  Spec  Inv,  unless  the  input  is  for  a  bulk  issue  item  and  contains  TEX  Code  C,  D,  or  G.  Contact Physical Inventory Control Section. A9.9.6.1.  Suspense  File.    IC  will  hold  rejected  receipt  documents  in  suspense  until  the inventory is completed. The Physical Inventory Control Section will inform IC once the freeze code has been lifted and receipt may be processed. A9.9.6.2.  Storage of Items on Hold.  IC personnel will retain the property until a Due Out Release or Notice-to-Stock is received.  Attach a copy of the 469 Reject and place property in a temporary hold location.  Note: The controlled item code is printed on line 4, position 54 of the reject notice.  The appropriate protection is given to items assigned a controlled item code other than U. A9.9.7.  Incomplete Items.  Items missing components are incomplete. Contact the Inspection Section  for  condition  code  determination  and  supporting  documentation.  Use  information provided to process the receipt. A9.9.8.  Military Assistance Program (MAP) country, No Routing Identifier (RIC), and Other Uncommon Sources. A9.9.8.1.  MAP.    When  property  is  received  from  a  MAP  country,  enter  one  of  the following codes in positions 45-48, as applicable: A9.9.8.1.1.  DMAP, for Military Assistance Program. A9.9.8.1.2.  DMAS, for Military Assistance Sales. A9.9.8.2.  Activities without RIC.  When property is received from an activity that has no RIC,  the  account  number  is  entered  in  positions  45-50  (Supplementary  Address)  of  the receipt  due-in  input.    If  the  account  number  cannot  be  identified,  use  the  service  code, followed by zeros. A9.9.8.3.  Other  Uncommon  Sources.    When  base-funded  property  is  received  from  a source other than Air Force, a DoD agency, GSA, or commercial vendor, enter a routing identifier code of JBW in positions 4-6 (Vendor Code or Due-In Routing Identifier Code) of the receipt input. A9.9.8.4.  If appropriate RIC cannot be determined.  Contact the Customer Support Liaison Element for assistance to determine the appropriate RIC to be used. A9.9.9.  Misidentified  Property.    Materiel  is  misidentified  when  the  NSN  of  the  property received differs from the NSN on the source document.  Report the receipt of misidentified materiel as follows: 172 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 A9.9.9.1.  Use  the  requisition  number  on  the  receiving  document  and  TEX  Code  Q  for input processing.  If there is no due-in, the original due-in should loaded so that TEX Code Q receipt procedures can be used (receipt not due-in procedures do not apply to TEX Code Q receipts). A9.9.9.2.  Other Discrepancies.  When misidentified materiel has the wrong quantity (over, short, partial, or excess), process using TEX code Q. A9.9.10.  Missing Property but Document Received. A9.9.10.1.  In  cases  where  a  source  document  is  received  without  the  actual  property accompanying it, attempt to locate the property.  If the property cannot be located, process the receipt as a shortage. Enter a quantity of zero in the REC input. A9.9.10.2.  In cases where the actual property received matched the source document but the document number does not associate to the TCN on the MSL, prepare a shipped short receipt for the document number on the MSL. Enter a quantity of zero in the REC input. Receipt the property actually received using the accompanying source document IAW with this AFI. A9.9.11.  Quantity Variance.  The quantity actually received differs from the amount on the source document.  Change the source document to reflect the quantity actually received and annotate  “overage”  or  “shortage”  as  applicable.    Annotate  the  source  document  with  the over/short quantity. See paragraph A9.4. A9.9.11.1.  The  ES-S  SDR  will  automatically  query  the  SBSS  transaction  history  and create/display  an  SDR  record  using  information  collected  from  the  SBSS  901,  Daily Transaction History Record (if processed on the same day of the receipt transaction) or the SBSS 704, Consolidated Transaction History Record.  ES-S identifies discrepant receipts based on established program logic, see Table A9.6. Table A9.6.  Quantity Variance Program Logic.  A9.9.11.2.  Effects  on Computer Records.  When a claims receivable detail is  built  as a result of a receipt processing, it will appear on the Claims Receivable/Payable Transactions portion  of  the  D20  report.    RNB  Detail  is  created  under  program  control  and  the  total quantity due-in is reflected in the 213, QTY RECEIVED, field. A9.9.12.  Excess  Receipts.    Quantity  received  is  greater  than  the  quantity  requisitioned  but equal to the quantity shipped. Enter Quantity Variance Flag E in REC input. A9.9.13.  Partial Receipts.  Quantity received is less than the quantity due-in but equal to the quantity shipped. When the quantity on the source document is equal to the quantity actually received, do not use a partial quantity flag or quantity variance flag in the REC input. Ensure the suffix code on the source document is used on the REC input.  Note: A shipment status AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 173 detail will remain on file to prevent any additional shipment status images (ASx/AUx) from creating a ship status detail for the same requisition number and suffix code.  These shipment status details (211) can be identified with REC stored in the 211 DT-AV-SHPT and the date received in the 211 date of last transaction.  These details will remain on file until the total due-in quantity is received. A9.9.14.  Degraded Operations.  Receipt MICAP shipments manually during periods of ES-S inoperability.    Obtain  the  suspect  materiel  listing  from  the  Inspection  Section.  Forward property that appears on suspect materiel listing to the Inspection Section for further action.  Ensure source documents remain with the item. A9.9.15.  Rejects/Delayed  Action.    ES-S  detects  errors  during  processing  and  stops  the program. IC will verify receipt transaction information and re-input data. Place property with unresolved  rejects  in  a  temporary  hold  area  until  a  Notice-to-Stock  or  Due  Out  Release  is produced.  Attached  the  reject  notice  to  the  property  and  forward  a  copy  to  the  Customer Support Liaison Element for resolution. See paragraph A9.11. A9.9.16.  Suspect Items.  Receipts transaction against property on the Suspect Materiel Listing will produce an I302 or I305 Management Notice and be suspended on an unserviceable detail record (R920).  Attach the management notice to the property, place materiel in a temporary hold location and notify the Inspection Section for processing and resolution.  Use the CMOS Surface Freight Inbound Turnover Records to document the transfer of custody. A9.9.17.  Unacceptable  Materiel.    Unacceptable  materiel  is  materiel  with  an  NSN  on  the source document that is the same as the materiel delivered, but the FSC on the property is not the same as the item due-in (reject notice 384).  Process the receipt using TEX Code U.  The TEX Code U receipt processes the asset(s) to stock (I046 management notice). A9.9.17.1.  Input processing.  For input processing, use the requisition number appearing on  the  receiving  document.    When  a  due-in  does  not  exist  (reject  356),  provide  the Customer Support Liaison Element a copy of the source document and reject notice. A9.9.17.2.  Use of Unacceptable Materiel.  Before submission of report of unacceptable materiel,  coordinate  with  the  Customer  Support  Liaison  Element  to  determine  if  the property received will satisfy the original requirement.  If the original requirement can be satisfied by the materiel, the Customer Support Liaison Element will take the appropriate action to link the due-in to the DOR for the organization. A9.9.17.3.  Unacceptable  Materiel  Report.    The  ES-S  SDR  program  will  automatically query the SBSS transaction history and create/display an SDR record using information collected from the SBSS Daily Transaction History Record 901 (if processed on the same day of the receipt transaction) or the Consolidated Transaction History Record 704.  ES-S identifies discrepant receipts when Transaction Phrase Code (TTPC) equals “8A” and TEX Code equals “Q” or “U” - discrepancy = Incorrect Item. A9.9.17.4.  Quantity variations.  When unacceptable materiel is the wrong quantity (over, short, partial, or excess), process using TEX code U. A9.9.18.  Unserviceable  but  Reparable  Items.    Contact  the  Inspection  Section  for  items received  in  an  unserviceable  (reparable)  condition.  A  qualified  inspector  (not  a  limited inspector)  determines  the  appropriate  supply  condition  code  (SCC)  E,  F,  or  G  for  the  REC 174 AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 input. An unserviceable (reparable) receipt will establish an unserviceable detail and produce an I045 MGT management notice. Forward a copy of the management notice to the Customer Support Liaison Element for action. A9.9.19.  Records  Reversal  and  Correction  (RRC).    The  initiator  will  forward  the  record reversal and correction (formerly known as Reverse Post (RVP)) request to his/her assigned supervisor. Once the supervisor’s approval is received, the initiator will provide the request to Flight leadership for approval. See AFMAN 23-122, Section 5F. A9.10.  Supply  Discrepancies  Report  (SDR).    The  ES-S  SDR  capability  automates  the management of SDRs at the base level.  ES-S identifies and creates SDR records for all discrepant receipt transactions processed within the SBSS, regardless of the Controlled Item  Identification Code (CIIC) or dollar value.  Each SDR record may be identified as Mandatory (based on CIIC or dollar value) or Optional.  The program compiles a list of these SDR records and presents them to the user for review and action.  Refer to the ES-S User’s Manual, Chapter 14, for information concerning SDRs. A9.10.1.  Discrepant Controlled Inventory Items, AA&E parts.  Report discrepancies against these items  within 24 hours of discovery  for shortage, overage, wrong item,  or misdirected shipments.  This  includes  stock  number  material  with  a  cataloged  controlled  inventory  item code (CIIC) indicating the item is identified as classified or sensitive.  In addition, pilferable codes associated with arms and ammunition are also included (codes N and P) in this category. A9.10.1.1.  Total response time to include processing by multiple action activities will not exceed  25  calendar  days.    Wrong  item  receipts  identified  as  controlled/sensitive  and unidentified items are returned to the designated location within 30 calendar days of the SDR reply. A9.10.2.  IC  SDR  Submissions.    Submit  a  SF  364s  ROD/SDR  for  item  or  packaging discrepancies which meet at least one of these conditions in Table A9.7. Table A9.7.  SDR Discrepancy Matrix. If  TPPC is: 8A 9X AND: AND Pos 4-6: AND Pos 19: Discrepancy is: TEX Code = “Q” or “U” TEX Code = “P” or “Z” Stockage Priority Code = “J” Document Number and Action Quantity = Same as other receipt transactions Condition code = “F”, “G”, “H”, “J”, “K”, or “L” - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - “REC” “REC” “REC” “REC” “REC” “S” “P” “O” “E” “S” Incorrect Item Damaged Shipment RNDI Duplicate Receipt Unserviceable*  Suspended Material Shortage Receipt Claims Receivable Overage Receipt Excess Receipt Shortage Receipt * Incomplete, condemned, reparable AFI24-203  13 JULY 2017 175 A9.10.3.  Data elements and associated code sets applicable to SDR submissions are located at http://www2.dla.mil/j-6/dlmso/About/committees.asp. A9.11.  Rejects and Management Notices.  If program edits detect an error during processing, the  program  is  stopped.  The  reject  program  automatically  manages  records  status  of  ILS-S processing actions. The database records are restored to their condition at the start of the run, and a  reject  notice  is  printed.    Note:  Reject  notices  are  printed  to  advise  the  individual,  or  section receiving the notice that certain conditions exist and that action needs to be taken to correct the condition. All rejects should be processed as rapidly as possible. A9.11.1.  General Use/Reject/Management Notices refer to AFH 23-123V2PT2. A9.11.2.  Common  rejects.
