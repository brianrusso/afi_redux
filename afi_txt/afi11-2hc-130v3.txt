General.  The  ACC  command  and  control  (C2)  system  is  based  on  the  principles  of centralized  monitoring  and  decentralized  control  and  execution.  The  result  is  a  C2  mechanism which keeps the ACC Commander informed of the current status of ACC forces while enabling the wing or group commander to exercise control over day-to-day operations. 2.2.  Operational Control (OPCON).  ACC and AFRC are designated as the controlling agency for  assigned  Air  Force  aircraft,  while  theater  commands  have  operational  control  (OPCON)  of theater-based assets. Reserve Component (RC) missions for non-mobilized assets are controlled through  applicable  ANG  and  AFRC  C2  centers.  In  practice,  responsibility  for  planning  and executing  ACC  missions  is  routinely  delegated  to  the  wing  or  group  commander.  The  wing  or group  commander,  in  turn,  exercises  control  of  non-close-hold  missions  through  the  command post  supporting  the  wing.  In  the  event  that  assigned  forces  undergo  a  change  in  operational control (CHOP), responsibility for mission monitoring passes from the wing or group C2 facility to  the  gaining  command.  Changeover  will  be  accomplished  IAW  the  pertinent  OPLAN, OPORD,  or  deployment  or  execution  order  (T-0).    NOTE:  For  certain  close-hold  activities, security  considerations  may  compel  the  wing  or  group  commander  to  shift  mission monitoring responsibilities from the command post to another wing agency. The wing or group commander will  ensure  procedures  are  established  for  the  responsible  agency  to  monitor  mission  progress and  advise  the  MAJCOM/A3  and  Commander  Air  Combat  Command  (COMACC)  as appropriate (T-1). 2.3.  Mission Monitoring.  Except for selected close-hold missions, the ACC Command Center monitors  all  ACC  aircraft  that  move  to,  from,  or  between  OCONUS  off-station  locations.  Key components of the ACC C2 system are the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) and the various C2 facilities at theater and wing locations. When aircraft are deployed in support of operations and exercises, the Command Center may obtain additional information from Situation Reports  (SITREP)  and  Deployed  Status  Reports  (DSR).  The  following  mission  monitoring procedures  primarily  apply  to  missions  that  are  not  close-hold  in  nature  and  have  not  had operational control changed to another command: 2.3.1.  The respective unit command post tracks  CONUS  movements  of their aircraft based on aircrew reports. 2.3.2.  Information  on  OCONUS  movements  of  ACC  aircraft  is  relayed  to  the  ACC Command  Center  (DSN:  574-5411;  commercial:  757-764-5411)  via  telephone  notification from  host  wing  command  posts.  The  host  wing  command  posts  receive  their  data  directly from aircrew or via the en route facility’s local command post. 2.3.3.  The following paragraphs summarize mission commander, or if none is assigned, pilot in command duties with regard to flight reporting: 2.3.3.1.  Missions  at  bases  with  a  C2  Facility.  The  mission  commander  or  pilot  in command  will ensure that at least 30 minutes prior to landing, the following information is relayed to the applicable C2 facility: call signs, mission numbers, ETAs, maintenance status, and additional service requirements (T-2). After landing, the mission commander or pilot in command will contact the C2 facility with ground handling requirements and AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   19  departure information (T-2). In addition, CONUS based crews operating OCONUS must keep their home station command posts appraised of all actual takeoff and landing times, projected  takeoff  times,  and  other  related  information.  Home  station  command  posts relay information to the ACC Command Post. These actions keep the ACC Commander apprised of the locations and status of OCONUS forces. When forces CHOP to another theater  commander,  reporting  will  be  through  theater  C2  centers  upon  arrival  in  the assigned area of responsibility (T-0). 2.3.3.2.  Missions  at  Bases  without  a  C2  Facility.  The  mission  commander  or  pilot  in command will report, as soon as possible, actual takeoff and landing times, maintenance status, projected takeoff times, and other pertinent data to the host wing command post or command  center  (T-2).  Methods  of  communicating  this  information  include  HF  phone patch,  satellite  communication  (SATCOM),  satellite  phone  (SATPHONE),  DSN,  and commercial  telephone.  Refer  to  the  FLIP,  Flight  Information  Handbook,  USAF  High Frequency  Single  Side  Band  (HF/SSB)  Airways  and  Command  and  Control  Station section for guidance on mission reporting. 2.3.3.2.1.

The  final  decision  to  delay  a  mission  may  be  made either by the agency with OPCON or the PIC when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to start or continue a mission. Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with  the  PIC.  If  the  PIC  refuses  a  mission,  it  will  not  depart  until  the  conditions  have  been corrected or improved so that the mission can operate safely. Another PIC and aircrew will not be alerted to take the same mission under the same conditions. 2.6.1.  Diverting or rerouting a mission must be authorized by the commander with OPCON, except  in  an  emergency  or  when  required  by  en  route  or  terminal  weather  conditions  or facilities.  In  the  event  of  an  emergency  or  weather-related  divert  or  reroute,  the  mission commander or PIC must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible. 2.6.1.1.  The  controlling  agency  directing  the  rerouting  or  diversion  is  responsible  for ensuring destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the aircraft. 2.6.1.2.  The PIC will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or aircrew limitations that may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission. 2.6.2.  When directed to  an alternate airfield,  the PIC will request  enroute weather, existing and forecast weather for the alternate, notices to airmen (NOTAMs), and appropriate airfield information from the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) from the C2 center agency.  If the planned alternate becomes unsuitable while en route, the PIC will coordinate with  the  C2  center  for  other  suitable  alternates.  The  PIC  is  final  authority  on  selecting  a suitable alternate.  The PIC will also coordinated with the C2 center agency for customs and ground service requirements prior to arrival. 2.7.  Posse Comitatus. 2.7.1.  (T-0)  The Posse Comitatus Act (PCA) of 1878 (18 U.S.C. § 1385) prohibits the direct active participation of military forces to execute civilian laws unless otherwise authorized by law.  This  Act  does  not  apply  to  non-federalized  Air  National  Guard  forces  in  State  Active Duty  (SAD)  status  or  Title  32  U.S.C.  status.  To  the  extent  authorized,  the  Air  Force  may provide  indirect  support  and/or  assistance  in  restoring  public  health  and  services,  and  civil order. 2.7.2.  (T-1)  It  is  DoD  Policy  to  cooperate  with  civilian  law  enforcement  officials  to  the maximum  extent practicable. AFI 10-801,  Defense Support to Civilian Authorities (DSCA), incorporates  that  directive  and  provides  uniform  policies  and  procedures  to  be  followed concerning support provided to federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement agencies. It   22  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 establishes specific limitations and restrictions on the use of Air Force personnel, equipment, facilities,  and  services  by  civilian  law  enforcement  organizations.  Report  all  requests  for assistance and coordinate all requests from  civilian law enforcement authorities through the appropriate command and control channels. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   23  Chapter 3 CREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 3.1.

The MAJCOM with aircraft ownership will retain all flight  and ground mishap reporting responsibility. (T-1) 3.4.2.  Approval  Authority.  The  OG/CC  is  the  approval  authority  for  interfly  on  aircraft under his/her control. (T-1) 3.5.  Intrafly.  (T-1)  Intrafly  is  the  exchange  and/or  substitution  of  aircrew  members  from separate  units  under  the  same  MAJCOM  to  accomplish  flying  missions.    Normally,  intrafly should be used only to relieve short-term qualified manpower shortfalls. 3.5.1.  The OG/CC possessing the aircraft is approval authority for intrafly between units.   26  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 3.5.2.  As  a  minimum,  crews  will  be  qualified  in  the  aircraft,  as  well  as  systems  or configuration  required  to  fly  the  aircraft  and/or  mission.    If  non-current,  comply  with paragraphs 3.1.1, 3.1.2, and 3.1.3 3.6.  Flight  Duty  Period,  Crew  Duty  Period  and  Crew  Rest  Restrictions.  (T-1) Reference AFI 11-202V3.  Flight  Duty Period (FDP) falls within the constraints of the Crew Duty Period (CDP).    FDP  and  CDP  both  begin  when  aircrew  members  report  for  official  duties.    The maximum  Flight  Duty  Period  is  16  hours  for  a  basic  crew.    An  aircrew  member’s  Crew  Duty Period is a maximum of 18 hours or FDP plus two hours.  The addition of CDP is intended for a basic  crew  to  complete  aircrew  duties  at  the  aircraft  after  engine  shutdown;  (e.g.  cargo loading/offloading, refueling, etc.).  NOTE:  (AFRC and ANG only) CDP and FDP include both military  duty  and  civilian  work.  It  begins  when  the  individual  reports  for  his  or  her  first  duty period (military or civilian).  FDP ends with engine shutdown at the end of the mission or series of missions.  CDP extends up to two hours after FDP ends. When crewmembers perform other duties prior to flight-related duties (including civilian work for AFRC and ANG crewmembers), CDP/FDP begins when reporting for the other duties.  NOTE: Waiver authority for paragraph 3.6 is MAJCOM/A3 or deployed equivalent unless otherwise noted. 3.6.1.  Flight  Duty  Period  (FDP).    IAW  AFI  11-202V3  and  ACC  Supplement,  FDP  is  the period  that  starts  when  an  aircrew  reports  for  a  mission,  briefing,  or  other  official  duty (including  civilian  work  for  ARC  crew  members)  and  ends  when  engines  are  shut  down  at the end of the mission, mission leg, or a series of missions.  Maximum FDP is 16+00 hours for a basic aircrew and 20+00 hours for an augmented aircrew. 3.6.1.1.  The basic FDP is 16 hours providing no mission events, helicopter air refueling (HAAR)  below  3,000  feet  AGL,  pilot  proficiency  training,  or  functional  check  flights (FCF) are accomplished after 12 hours and no Air Refueling or HAAR at or above 3,000 feet AGL after 14 hours. If the autopilot is not operational or its use is denied for more than 4 hours, the FDP will be 12 hours. If the autopilot fails after departure, continue to the next scheduled stop and then comply with the basic FDP limitations.  EXCEPTION: AFRC  and  ANG  FDP  is  16  hours  for  all  mission  events,  FCF  and  pilot  proficiency training  missions  originating  from  home  station  and  space  center  launch  and  recovery support missions. 3.6.1.2.  The augmented FDP is 20 hours for all Rescue HC-130s, providing no mission events,  HAAR  below  3,000  feet  AGL,  pilot  proficiency  training,  or  FCFs  are accomplished after 16 hours and no Air Refueling events or HAAR at or above 3,000 feet AGL  are  accomplished  after  18  hours.    If  the  autopilot  is  not  operational  or  its  use  is denied for more than 8 hours, the FDP will be 16 hours. 3.6.1.2.1.  Crew changes should not be made immediately prior to performing critical phases  of  flight.  Normally,  30  minutes  prior  to  initiating  the  checklist  for  an  event will allow the new  crewmember time to  get  acclimated.  EXCEPTION: For training missions  instructors  will  plan  and  brief  crew  changes  to  safely  maximize  training objectives. 3.6.1.2.2.  Minimum in-flight crew rest facilities will be 3 bunks or litters. 3.6.1.2.3.  FDP length will be based on the mission to be performed. For example, if the planned mission duration is 15 hours from show time to termination, then a basic AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   27  FDP is appropriate even if the crew is augmented. Once established, a basic FDP will not be changed to an augmented FDP, regardless of crew composition. 3.6.1.2.4.  Time  spent traveling  as  a  passenger  on  commercial  or  military transportation  in  excess  of  4  hours  counts  as  part  of  the  duty  period.    Official  duty travel  for  personnel  in  official  military/civilian  status  will  count  toward  the  duty period. 3.6.1.2.5.  The  PIC  may  extend  the  crew’s  FDP  and/or  CDP  by  up  to  2  hours  on  a mission in progress. The PIC should attempt to comply with the waiver authority in AFI  11-202V3.  If  this  option  is  exercised,  the  PIC    must  coordinate  with  command and  control  agencies  so  that  downstream  activities  are  not  adversely  affected. Missions will not be scheduled to exceed the maximum FDP in this paragraph. PICs must  carefully  weigh  all  factors  affecting  their  crew  before  electing  to  extend  the flight duty period. 3.6.2.  Crew Duty Period (CDP). CDP is the period that starts when an aircrew reports for a mission, briefing, or other official duty (including civilian work for ARC crew members) and ends at the completion of aircrew duties at the aircraft. Maximum CDP is 18+00 hours for a basic aircrew and 22+00 hours for an augmented aircrew. 3.6.3.  Rescue Alert Procedures.  Rescue alert duty is defined as any period during which an alert crew is on call to perform a specific mission. Aircrew will be placed into crew rest prior to alert status. Upon entering crew rest, an aircrew will be given an expected alert assumption time. Rescue alert aircrews must be prepared to respond at any time during the alert period. 3.6.3.1.  Alert personnel are those required to be on duty for the prompt execution of the mission. Alert crews will be readily available in a location which allows the crew to meet the required time to launch from notification. Suitable facilities include adequate sleeping accommodations for the entire crew, unless at home station. 3.6.3.2.  The  alert  duty  period  will  begin  at  a  scheduled  time  determined  by  the unit/mission commander. Provide aircrew members an inviolate 12 hours crew rest prior to alert duty. The unit/mission commander will determine the normal length of the alert period, not to exceed 72 hours.  An alert period may be extended up to a maximum of 7 days  with  MAJCOM/A3  (or  deployed  equivalent)  approval  provided  aircrew  members receive a 24-hour recovery period prior to the next alert. 3.6.3.3.  The crew duty period will begin when the aircrew shows for flight duties. Crews may complete initial alert activities (e.g., transportation, briefing, preflight, engine run of their alert aircraft) without starting their crew day. This time should not exceed 3 hours. Alert  response  exercises  that  terminate  prior  to  engine  start  do  not  start  crew  duty  time when they occur during normal waking hours. 3.6.3.4.  A  daily  update  briefing  may  be  accomplished  without  starting  crew  duty  time. This  brief  can  include  weather,  local  NOTAMS,  latest  FCIF  information,  special instructions,  and  any  other  appropriate  items.  The  PIC  determines  which  crewmembers attend the brief. 3.6.4.  Non-Rescue  Alert  Procedures. (T-1) PIC shall establish a legal for alert time based on  aircraft  availability  and  mission  requirements,  as  appropriate.    If  the  crew  is  not  alerted   28  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 within 8 hours (e.g. due to aircraft availability, mission delays, etc.), the PIC will return the crew  to  crew  rest  and  establish  a  new  legal  for  alert  time.    OG/CC  will  define  alerting procedures for local training missions in Chapter 10, Local Operating Procedures.  Provide a minimum of 2 hours (except ARC at home station) from arrival at aircraft to stations time for crewmembers to complete preflight duties (if not previously preflighted). 3.6.5.  Flying the Alert Crew: 3.6.5.1.  If  the  alert  crew  is  launched  and  returns  with  FDP  remaining,  they  may  be launched  again  within  the  constraints  of  that  crew  day.  Numerous  circumstances  may arise that affect the decision to replace the alert crew and each incident must be evaluated on an individual basis. 3.6.5.2.  The  alert  crew  will  not  normally  be  used  as  a  "preflight"  or  "engine  run"  crew for  aircraft  other  than  their  alert  aircraft.    Alert  crews  will  not  perform  other  official duties  (e.g.,  additional  duties,  commander’s  call,  safety  meeting,  etc.)  within  their  alert period.  EXCEPTION:  During normal waking hours, alert aircrew may mission plan at the discretion of the PIC. 3.6.5.3.  An alert crew should not remain in alert status for more than 2 consecutive 72-hour  alert  periods.  The  crew  will  receive  12  hours  of  premission  crew  rest  between  the first and second alert periods. Following completion of the second 72-hour alert period, the  crew  or  crewmember  will  receive  a  minimum  of  24  hours  crew  rest  prior  to reassuming alert status. 3.6.6.  Flying  Crew  Chief  Work  and  Rest  Plan.    The  crew  chief  is  responsible  to  the  PIC.  The  PIC,  after  consulting  with  the  home  station  chief  of  maintenance  (or  deployed equivalent),  will  determine  how  long  the  crew  chief  can  safely  perform  aircraft  recovery actions.  The crew chief must have the opportunity to sleep 8 hours in each 24-hour period.  See AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, for detailed guidance. 3.6.7.  TDY Crew Rest/Post Deployment Stand Down. 3.6.7.1.  All primary and deadhead crewmembers departing on missions scheduled to be away from home station or rotational base for more than 16 hours or recover away from home station should be notified 24 hours before reporting for the mission.  The first  12 hours  are  not  considered  crew  rest,  but  are  designed  to  allow  crewmembers  time  to resolve personal affairs.  During these first 12 hours, a crewmember may perform limited non-flying  duties.    The  second  12  hour  period  is  inviolate  crew  rest  (ARC  will  comply with AFI 11-202V3 as supplement). 3.6.7.2.  Postmission  crew  rest  begins  upon  the  final  return  of  an  individual  to  home station and runs continuously until completed.  Postmission crew rest must be completed before starting the 12 hour predeparture crew rest  period for a subsequent  mission.  Do not  require  a  crewmember  to  get  immunizations,  engage  in  ground  training,  perform standby  or  squadron  duties,  or  perform  any  other  activity  which  would  encroach  upon crew rest.  Waiver authority for postmission crew rest is the OG/CC.  Waiver requests for postmission crew rest are considered on a case by case basis only with the concurrence of the  individual  crewmember.    Compute  post-TDY  crew  rest  at  the  rate  of  1  hour  off  for every 3 hours of TDY,  not  to  exceed 72 hours.  EXCEPTION:  Not applicable to  ARC and to students in formal schools listed in AFCAT 36-2223, USAF Formal Schools. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   29  3.6.7.3.  Post  Deployment  Stand  Down.

(T-1)  The ultimate objective of the aircraft maintenance team is to provide an aircraft  for  launch  with  all  equipment  operational,  Fully  Mission  Capable  (FMC).  Manpower limitations,  skills,  and  spare  part  availability  have  a  negative  and  direct  impact  on accomplishment. However, under specific circumstances, some missions can be safely operated without  all  equipment  being  operational.  Using  the  following  policies,  the  PIC  is  the  final authority  in  determining  an  overall  status  of  an  aircraft.  Use  the  following  maintenance identifiers to effectively communicate a status of an aircraft: 4.1.1.  Mission Essential (ME). An item, system, or subsystem component essential for safe aircraft  operation  or  mission  completion  will  be  designated  Mission  Essential  (ME)  by  the PIC in AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. Include a brief explanation of the reason for ME status in the AFTO Form 781A discrepancy block. A PIC accepting  an  aircraft  (one  mission  or mission  segment)  without  an  item  or  system  does  not commit that PIC (or a different PIC) to subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative. 4.1.2.  Mission  Contributing  (MC).  Any  discrepancies  not  currently  ME,  but  may  become ME (if circumstances change), are designated as MC in the AFTO Form  781A discrepancy block. Every effort will be made to clear the MC discrepancies at the earliest opportunity as maintenance  skills,  ground  time,  and  spare  part  availability  permit.  If  subsequently,  in  the PIC’s judgment, mission safety would be compromised by the lack of any component, he/she may redesignate the said discrepancies/component as ME. However, do not delay a mission to correct an MC discrepancy. 4.1.3.  Open Item. Discrepancies not expected to adversely impact the current mission or any subsequent missions are not designated MC or ME. These items receive low priority and are normally  worked  at  home  station.  Do  not  accept  an  aircraft  from  factories,  modification centers, or depots unless all instruments are installed and operative. 4.1.4.  If  the  PIC  elects  to  operate  with  degraded  equipment  or  aircraft  systems,  coordinate mission  requirements  (e.g.,  revised  departure  times,  fuel  requirements,  maintenance requirements, etc.) prior to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not  adversely  impact  follow-on  missions.  For  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  or  Air  Force Reserve  Command  (AFRC)  aircraft  on  ANG  or  AFRC  mission  identifiers,  coordinate through  the  Air  National  Guard  Operations  Center  (NGB/A3YC)  or  Air  Force  Reserve Command Center (HQ AFRC/A3OC). 4.2.  Policy.  This chapter provides guidance on minimum equipment requirements and operating with degraded equipment. 4.3.  Waiver  Protocol.  (T-1)  Waivers  to  operate  with  degraded  equipment  are  granted  on  a case-by-case basis.  The PIC determines the need for a waiver after coordinating with the lowest practical level of command.  MEL waiver authority is as follows: 4.3.1.  Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   31  4.3.2.  MAJCOM  Directed  Missions.  MAJCOM/A3  with  mission  execution  authority  for RegAF  and  ARC  units  flying  MAJCOM-directed  missions  (includes  Unit  Effectiveness Inspections). Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency. 4.3.3.  Contingency  Missions.  COMAFFOR  (or  equivalent)  for  the  agency  with  C2,  if  not specified in the OPORD/Tasking Order. 4.3.4.  ARC  Directed  Missions.  ARC  maintains  C2  and  waiver  authority  for  ARC  directed mission prior to mobilization. 4.3.5.  Determine  governing  source  document  (i.e.  AFI,  Flight  Manual,  Maintenance  T.O., etc.)  to  ascertain  the  waiver  authority.  Use  C2  channels  to  notify  the  appropriate  waiver authority. Waivers of this nature may require an extended response time. 4.4.  HERP  Procedures.  For  hostile  environment  repair  procedures,  reference  AFSOCM  11-201, Hostile Environment Repair Procedures.  See Chapter 12 for additional guidance. 4.5.  Deviations  and  Technical  Assistance  Service.  At  any  time  in  the  decision  process,  the PIC  may  request  technical  support  and  additional  assistance  from  their  home  unit,  MAJCOM staff, and maintenance representatives. 4.5.1.  A  PIC  electing  to  operate  with  degraded  equipment  or  aircraft  systems  (with appropriate waiver) must coordinate mission requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements, etc.) with the controlling C2 agency before flight. 4.5.2.  If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or aircraft  from  a  situation  not  covered  by  the  AFI  and  immediate  action  is  required,  the  PIC may deviate from this chapter according to paragraph 1.3  Aircrew should report deviations (without waiver) through channels to appropriate MAJCOM/A3 within 48 hours. Units must be  prepared  to  collect  background  information  and  submit  a  follow-up  written  report  upon request. 4.6.  Command Operating Guidelines.  (T-1) 4.6.1.  Except  as  listed  in  the  guidance  of  this  chapter,  aircraft  will  not  depart  if  any equipment required to execute flight manual emergency procedures is inoperative. Table 4.1 lists  minimum  equipment  requirements  and  is  provided  to  serve  as  a  quick  reference  guide for the PIC to determine required equipment.  Unless specifically referenced in the remarks or  elsewhere  in  this  chapter,  the  PIC  will  determine  equipment  required  to  accomplish  a given  mission.    The  PIC  is  expected  to  develop,  and  is  empowered  to  use,  prudent  RM analysis  based  on  mission,  environment,  threat,  aircraft  systems,  and  aircrew  qualification when  determining  required  equipment  for  safe  mission  accomplishment.    NOTE:    For  any instrument that presents both analog and digital information, either presentation is acceptable at the PICs discretion. Table 4.1.  Minimum Equipment Requirements.

If inoperative, all four oil quantity gauges must be operative Oil cooler flaps may be open and fixed as long as normal oil temperature can be maintained. 1  4.6.2.  Pressurization and Air Conditioning Systems. Pressurization and both air conditioning systems should be operational if patients are carried. If a system fails at an en route stop, the mission  may  continue  (coordinate  with  the  senior  medical  crewmember  when  patients  are carried)  to  a  destination  with  repair  capability.  Required  en  route  stops  are  authorized.  The PIC will ensure passengers and patients are briefed on the possibility that discomfort may be encountered. Air conditioning/pressurization systems are not required for low level missions if a reasonable temperature can be maintained. 4.6.3.  Electrical System: 4.6.3.1.  All engine AC generators for all C-130s should be operational prior to departure. If  a  generator  fails  at  an  en  route  stop,  the  mission  may  continue  to  a  destination  with repair  capability.  Required  en  route  stops  are  authorized.  If  the  AC  generator  is  not equipped  with  a  disconnect,  it  will  be  removed  and  the  generator  mount  padded  before flight.  Local  training  and  contingency  missions  may  continue  after  a  generator  is disconnected  or  removed  and  the  mount  padded,  provided  no  other  electrical malfunctions exist. 4.6.3.2.  An  operative  ATM  or  APU  generator  is  required  for  unrestricted  flight.  If  the system  is  inoperative,  flight  in  day  visual  meteorological  conditions  (VMC)  is permissible  provided  no  other  electrical  malfunction  exists.  The  generator  of  the  HC-130(H)N will be removed and padded prior to operation of the APU. 4.6.4.  Fuel  System.  The  primary  concern  with  inoperative  fuel  boost  pumps  or  quantity indicators  is  fuel  balance  and  wing  loading.  Degraded  operation  is  permissible;  however, flight  crews  must  consider  potentially  trapped  fuel  and  decreased  range,  should  further degradation  occur.  The  following  paragraphs  provide  guidelines  for  degraded  fuel  system operations under most circumstances. 4.6.4.1.  One pump must be operable for each external tank containing fuel. 4.6.4.2.  One main tank fuel indicator may be inoperative. Two main tank indicators may be inoperative provided they are not symmetrical tanks or on the same wing. 4.6.4.2.1.  Verify  the  tank  with  the  inoperative  indicator  and  its  symmetrical  tank quantity using  a fuel  tank dip  stick.   NOTE:  Ensure maximum  outboard main tank fuel  weight  is  not  exceeded  when  stores  of  any  kind  are  installed  on  the  outboard wing (e.g., refueling pods).   34  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 4.6.4.2.2.  At en route stops when engines are shut down, dip check the tank with the inoperative indicator and the symmetrically opposite tank. 4.6.4.2.3.  Start crossfeed operation when any main tank decreases to 2,000 pounds. 4.6.4.2.4.  Engine  out  training  using  the  engine  corresponding  to  the  inoperative indicator  or  its  symmetrically  opposite  will  not  be  conducted  during  tank  to  engine operation. 4.6.4.2.5.  Maintain symmetrical engine fuel flow. 4.6.4.2.6.  Plan to terminate flights with a minimum of 8,000 pounds calculated main tank fuel. 4.6.4.3.  One external fuel tank indicator may be inoperative provided both external fuel tanks  are  checked  full  or  empty.  Both  external  fuel  tank  indicators  may  be  inoperative provided  both  external  tanks  are  checked  empty.  When  an  external  tank  indicator  is inoperative  and  the  tank  cannot  be  visually  checked  empty  due  to  foam  modification, comply with the following prior to flight: 4.6.4.3.1.  Check  pressure  with  each  pump  in  the  external  tank.  If  no  pressure  is obtained, the tank is verified empty. 4.6.4.3.2.  If pressure is obtained, transfer the fuel from the external tank. Defuel the external tank if unable to ground transfer. 4.6.4.3.3.  When unable to verify an external tank is empty prior to engine start, place the  tank  on  crossfeed  until  no  pressure  is  obtained.  This  will  be  completed  prior  to takeoff. 4.6.4.3.4.  HC-130 aircraft with two external fuel tank indicators inoperative may fill external  tanks  to  maximum  providing  fuel  is  ground  transferred  to  a  fuselage  tank with an operable fuel quantity indicator; ground transfer from only one tank at a time. Transfer  no  more  than  1,000  pounds  at  a  time  between  an  external  tank  with  an inoperative indicator and the fuselage tank to maintain fuel balance. 4.6.4.4.  Both  auxiliary  tank  indicators  may  be  inoperative  provided  auxiliary  fuel quantity is verified. 4.6.4.5.  Both  a  main  and  external  fuel  tank  indicator  may  be  inoperative  on  the  same wing provided steps in paragraphs 4.6.4.2 and 4.6.4.3. are followed. 4.6.4.6.  For  other  than  normal  ground  refueling/defueling  operations  and  associated guidelines per this chapter, fuel will not be transferred into or out of a main or external fuel  tank  with  an  inoperative  indicator  or  its  symmetrical  tank  except  per  paragraph 4.6.4.3.4 and the following: 4.6.4.6.1.  Fuel transfer into a main or external tank with an inoperative indicator may be accomplished during contingency or emergency fuel need situations. All transfers, under these conditions, will be coordinated verbally and visually with the pilot/copilot as a backup for lateral wing balance. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   35  4.6.4.6.2.  A  reliable  source  of  known  quantity  transferred  must  be  available.  This source can be either the (AR) gage readings or internal aircraft operating fuel quantity indicators. 4.6.4.6.3.  Maintain  symmetrical  tanks  within  1,000  pounds  at  all  times.  If  small amounts (4,000 pounds or less) must be transferred, then transfer up to 1,000 pounds into  the  tank  with  the  inoperative  indicator  followed  by  an  equal  amount  into  the tank(s) with operative indicator(s). If large amounts of fuel must be transferred, then transfer  1,000  pounds  into  the  tank  with  the  inoperative  indicator,  then  up  to  2,000 pounds  as  needed  into  the  tank(s)  with  the  operative  indicators,  then  up  to  1,000 pounds  as  needed  into  the  tank  with  the  inoperative  indicator  to  bring  all  tanks symmetrical,  or  continue  up  to  2,000  pounds  as  needed,  repeating  the  cycle  until desired fuel quantity and balance is achieved in applicable tanks. 4.6.4.6.4.  Fuselage tank with an inoperative indicator. The flight engineer will verify the fuselage tank empty by utilizing the boost/dump pumps to transfer out of the tank until  tank  empty  light  illuminates.  WARNING:    Do  to  the  possibility  of  fuel fumes/leaking into the cargo compartment do not verify the fuselage tank full via the internal refueling cap. 4.6.4.7.  Fuel may be transferred from main or external tanks with inoperative indicators only  if  the  receiver  requires  emergency  fuel.  In  this  situation,  the  following  procedures will apply: 4.6.4.7.1.  The  fuel  counter  for  the  refueling  pod  being  used  must  be  operational  to track the amount of fuel transferred. 4.6.4.7.2.  Transfer from only one tank at a time. 4.6.4.7.3.  Transfer no more than 1,000 pounds at a time between the tanks with the inoperative indicator and its symmetrical tank to monitor fuel balance. 4.6.5.  Antiskid System: 4.6.5.1.  The antiskid may be inoperative for flight to a destination with repair capability. Required  en  route  stops  are  authorized.    The  mission  is  restricted  to  one  termination landing per sortie. 4.6.5.2.  A local training flight may continue once airborne if the antiskid fails provided the system is turned off. The mission is restricted to one termination landing. 4.6.5.3.  Maximum Effort operations are not authorized with antiskid inoperative. 4.6.6.  Landing  Gear  System.  If  a  landing  gear  malfunction  is  encountered,  only  a  full  stop landing  will  be  made.  The  discrepancy  will  be  corrected  prior  to  the  next  flight. EXCEPTION:  If  repair  capability  does  not  exist  and  a  positive  determination  is  made  that further flight can be accomplished with the gear down and locked, the aircraft may be flown to a destination where repair capability exists provided the gear is not moved from the down and locked position. Required en route stops are authorized. 4.6.6.1.  PICs  should  notify  appropriate  CC  prior  to  flying  with  landing  gear  down  and locked. 4.6.7.  Doors and Ramp System:   36  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 4.6.7.1.  Aircraft  will  not  depart  on  a  pressurized  flight  unless  the  door  warning  light system for the cargo ramp is operative. 4.6.7.2.  Aircraft  will  not  be  flown  with  a  crew  entrance  door  or  crew  entrance  door warning light malfunction. 4.6.7.3.  Aircraft  will  not  be  flown  pressurized  with  a  cargo  ramp  lock  malfunction. Unpressurized  flight  may  be  authorized  with  a  cargo  ramp  lock  malfunction  when mission requirements dictate. 4.6.8.  Radar.  Weather  mode  radar  must  be  operative  for  flights  into  areas  of  known  or forecast thunderstorms. 4.6.9.  Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). The CVR will be operational for all departures unless parts are not available on station to repair the unit.  Passengers will not be flown without an operative  CVR.    If  involved  in  a  mishap  or  incident,  after  landing  and  terminating  the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker. 4.7.  Supplements.  MAJCOMs may supplement Table 4.1 IAW Chapter 1. 4.8.  Navigation Systems. 4.8.1.  Compass  systems.  Both  compass  systems  should  be  operational.  If  one  system  fails, refer  to  the  flight  manual  to  determine  what  other  equipment  is  affected.  Two  independent sources of heading, i.e., one C-12 compass and one aligned inertial system are required.  The C-130  standby  compass  is  not  considered  a  separate  source  for  the  purposes  of  this paragraph. 4.8.2.  For flights in Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) airspace in the North  Atlantic  Region  a  fully  operational  SCNS,  to  include  the  navigator’s,  pilot’s,  and copilot’s IDCUs, is required. Equipment listed in FLIP AP/2 for permitting compliance with MNPS  is  mandatory.  Loss  of  any  component  before  track  entry  requires  return  to  a  station with maintenance capability or re-filing via specified routes. 4.8.3.  For  flights  on  all  other  Category  I  routes,  the  PIC  determines  the  minimum navigational  capability  required  to  safely  accomplish  the  mission.  Consider  the  following: length and route of flight, weather, and experience and proficiency of the crew. 4.8.4.  Basic  Area  Navigation  (BRNAV)  Airspace.    HC-130  aircraft  are  approved  for BRNAV  operations.    BRNAV  navigation  accuracy  criteria  is  RNP-5.    Pilots  will immediately  notify  ATC  if  any  of  the  required  equipment  fails  after  entry  into  BRNAV airspace  and  coordinate  a  plan  of  action.    Document  in  the  aircraft  forms  malfunctions  or failures of RNP required equipment. 4.8.4.1.  BRNAV operations require at least one fully operational INS system. 4.8.4.2.  The Maximum time limit for BRNAV operations is 9.6 hours.  This time limit is contingent  on  performing  a  medium  accuracy  alignment  of  the  aircraft  INU.    Once  the time limit is reached, the aircraft must perform a ground based realignment of the INU in order to maintain compliance with and continue flight in BRNAV airspace. 4.8.4.3.  While operating in  civil-controlled airspace, the aircraft must be flown in  INS-only and with the autopilot engaged. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   37  4.9.  HC-130P  aircraft  exceeding  38,000  Equivalent  Baseline  Hours  (EBH).  (T-1) In addition  to  flight  manual restrictions, aircrews  will adhere to  the  following training  restrictions when  operating  HC-130P  aircraft  that  have  reached  38,000  EBH.    Aircraft  inspected  and repaired IAW TCTO 1C-130-1908 are not restricted. 4.9.1.  The following restrictions apply: 4.9.1.1.  Do not exceed 190 KIAS below 3,000 feet AGL. 4.9.1.2.  Flight is prohibited when turbulence is forecasted or reported to be moderate or greater. 4.9.1.3.  Flight  is  prohibited  below  3,000  feet  AGL  in  mountainous  terrain  when  the winds are forecasted or reported to exceed 35 knots in the low level environment (below 3,000  feet  AGL).  This  applies  to  areas  of  transition  (takeoff  or  landing)  and  operations below the crests of any ridgeline within 50 NM. 4.9.1.4.  Crews will not conduct search patterns or rescue airdrop patterns in mountainous terrain if winds exceed 15 knots at an altitude that is 1,000 feet above the intended rescue airdrop/search  pattern  altitude  or  1,000  feet  above  the  crest  of  any  ridgeline  within  20 NM, whichever is higher. 4.9.1.5.  The  following  maneuvers  are  prohibited  regardless  of  altitude:  Threat maneuvering and tactical recoveries. EXCEPTION: self-contained approaches (straight-in or closed pattern). 4.9.2.  The  OG/CC  may  waive  these  restrictions  when  the  use  of  a  restricted  HC-130P  is required  for  operations  contingencies  (does  not  apply  to  the  restrictions  listed  in  the  flight manual). 4.9.3.  Crews  should  minimize  aircraft  exposure  time  during  low-level  operations.  It  is recommended  not  to  exceed  30  degrees  of  bank  with  any  flap  extension  and  50  degrees  of bank with a clean configuration.   38  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 Chapter 5 AIRLAND OPERATIONS 5.1.

Landing Gear and Flap Operation (T-1). 5.5.1.  The pilot in the right seat will operate the landing gear.  Actuate the landing gear only after command of the pilot flying (PF) the aircraft.  Prior to actuation of the landing gear, the other  pilot  will  acknowledge  the  command  by  repeating  it.    EXCEPTION:  Not  required during Infil/Exfil checklist. 5.5.2.  The PIC may assign flap operation to either the PM or the FE. Operate the flaps only after  the  command  of  the  PF.    Prior  to  operating  the  flaps,  acknowledge  the  command  by repeating it. 5.6.  Use  of  Outside  Observers.  To the maximum extent possible, crewmembers should assist in scanning/clearing outside during all taxi operations and in-flight during arrivals and departures below 10,000 ft. MSL duties permitting. 5.7.  Seat Belts.  (T-1)  Crewmembers occupying either the pilot, copilot, or flight engineer seat will have seat belts fastened at all times. 5.7.1.  All occupants will be seated with seat belts fastened during taxi, takeoff and landing.  EXCEPTION: instructors,  mission  commanders,  crewmembers performing scanner duties, outside observers during taxi, flight engineers, medical personnel, and loadmasters performing required duties are exempt; however, they will have a designated seat (spot for combat loading procedures) and required restraint available.   Flight  examiners, 5.7.2.  Provide a safety belt for all occupants over 2 years of age.  Occupants will fasten seat belts securely when turbulence is encountered or anticipated, or in areas of forecast clear air turbulence. 5.7.3.  Floor loading is authorized to support dedicated U.S. forces and foreign counterparts during operations, exercises, and training.  The PIC will ensure personnel are secured with a cargo strap during floor loading operations. 5.8.  Aircraft Lighting:   40  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 5.8.1.  For single ship, non-tactical operations refer to AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.  Use  taxi  lights  during  all  taxi  operations.    EXCEPTION:  When  taxi  lights  have  IR  lens covers installed, use the landing lights instead.  Use landing lights at night in unlit areas.  Use taxi  lights  in-flight  any  time  the  landing  gear  is  extended,  unless  reflections  cause  pilot distractions.  Formation and leading edge lights should be on during operations below 10,000 feet AGL.  Landing lights may be used continuously during local traffic pattern training and low altitude maneuvering in high-density traffic areas. 5.8.2.  NVG  operations  may  dictate  that  external  lights  are  turned  off  or  IR  lenses  are installed.    Conduct  training  operations  with  reduced  or  no  external  lighting  within  the confines  of  designated  restricted  areas,  warning  areas.  Lights  out  operations  in  MOAs  may be conducted IAW AFFSA ACC waiver Vol 3/20031. 5.9.  Advisory  Calls.  (T-1)  The  PF  will  announce  intentions  for  departures,  arrivals, approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. 5.9.1.  Any crewmember seeing a deviation of 200 feet altitude or 10 knots in airspeed, or a potential  terrain  or  obstruction  problem,  will  immediately  notify  the  PF.  Deviations  from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be announced. 5.9.2.  Tables  5.  1  through  Table  5.4  depict  mandatory  calls  for  takeoff,  climb  out  and descent, non-precision and precision approaches. Table 5.1.  Takeoff. Phase of Flight PM Call PF Response Takeoff – prior to refusal speed “Reject” (Note 1) At refusal speed “Go” (Note 2) At rotation speed “Rotate” (Note 2)    NOTES:   (1)  Prior  to  Refusal  Speed,  any  crewmember  noting  a  safety  of  flight  condition/malfunction will state “Reject” and give a brief description of the malfunction.

The pilot may continue to 100 HAT with reference to the approach lights only. The pilot may not descend below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and identifiable. (2) If the PF has stated “landing” then this call is not required.  (3) The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, or go-around.  5.10.  Wind  Limitations.  Maximum  crosswind  limits  are  in  accordance  with  flight  manual limitations.    All  maximum  effort  operations  and  simulated  engine  out  landings  (one  or  two engine inop) must fall within the ‘recommended’ area unless otherwise approved by the OG/CC, or  COMAFFOR  for  contingency/expeditionary  operations  when  units  experience  a  change  of operational control. 5.11.  RCR and RSC.  Reference T.O. 1C-130(MDS)-1-1 and AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. 5.11.1.  The  runway  surface  should  be  considered  wet  when  water  on  the  runway  causes  a reflective  glare.    The  RCR  values  listed  in  Table  5.5  are  estimates  based  on  operational experience and should be used only as a guide. Table 5.5.  RCR Values. TYPE SURFACE Asphalt Aluminum Matting M8A1/With Anti-Skid (PSP) M8A1/Without Anti-Skid (PSP) Clay Crushed Rock Coral RCR (DRY)  RCR (WET) 23 20 20 13 16 16 16 12 10 8 3 5 5 4 5.11.2.  Limit C-130 operations into and out of slush or water covered runways to a covering of one inch.  This number is based on performance charts where an RSC of 10 is equal to one inch  of  slush  or  water.    Performance  data  where  more  than  one  inch  of  slush  or  water  is present may not be accurate. 5.12.  Wake  Turbulence  Avoidance.  (T-1) Comply  with  wake  turbulence  avoidance  criteria. Acceptance  of  traffic  information,  instructions  to  follow  an  aircraft,  or  a  visual  approach clearance is acknowledgment that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts responsibility of providing wake turbulence separation. Refer to FLIP GP for more information concerning wake turbulence separation. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   43  5.13.  LZ  Markings.  LZ markings may vary depending upon the supporting agency.  Refer to AFI  13-217,  Drop  Zone  and  Landing  Zone  Operations.    The  markings  to  be  used  must  be established during mission planning and included in the aircrew briefing. 5.14.  Aircraft  Rescue  Fire  Fighting  Requirements  (ARFF).  ARFF  requirements  are  as follows: 5.14.1.  Up to four takeoffs and landings within 7 consecutive days may be accomplished at a Landing  Zone  (LZ)  or  airfield  without  ARFF  (T-1).  This  is  an  airfield  restriction.    Each Group/Wing should track landing totals at airfields under their control.  If landing totals are not  tracked  at  airfields  owned/controlled  by  other  agencies,  Wing/Group  current  ops  will track landings to ensure the restriction is not exceeded for assigned aircraft (T-1). 5.14.2.  For more frequent operations at an LZ or airfield, refer to AFPAM 32-2004, Aircraft Fire Protection for Military Operations Other Than War, and AFI 13-217 to calculate ARFF requirements.    NOTE:    Non-USAF  ARFF  vehicles  may  be  used  if  the  agent  and  pumping capabilities are equivalent. 5.14.3.  Waivers  to  the  ARFF  requirements  will  be  considered  on  a  case-by-case  basis. Required  information  for  waiver  request  can  be  found  in  AFPAM  32-2004  and  AFI  13-204V3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs. 5.15.  Runway and Taxiway Requirements (T-1).  Use normal takeoff and landing procedures whenever practical.  All  speeds and distances will be computed “without nose wheel steering.” For mission accomplishment the PIC may authorize “with nose wheel steering” corrections IAW performance manual guidance. 5.15.1.  Normal  Operations.    Minimum  runway  width  is  80  feet  or  25  meters.    Minimum taxiway width is 30 feet or 9 meters. 5.15.1.1.  Takeoff.    Minimum  runway  length  is  the  greater  of  balanced  or  unbalanced critical field length. 5.15.1.2.  Landing.    Minimum  runway  length  is  landing  distance  plus  the  following corrections: 5.15.1.2.1.  Runway Visual Range (RVR) less than 40 (3/4 mile) – add 1,000 feet. 5.15.1.2.2.  RVR equal to or greater than 40 (3/4 mile) – add 500 feet. 5.15.1.2.3.  If  runway  length  available  for  landing  is  less  than  required  by  the previous criteria,  crews may use landing  ground roll plus  1,000 feet  when approved by the squadron commander.  In this case, you must ensure the landing touchdown is in the first 500 feet of the runway. 5.15.2.  Short Field Operations.  Minimum runway width is 60 feet or 19 meters.  Minimum taxiway width is 30 feet or 9 meters. 5.15.2.1.  Only  mission  qualified  pilots  may  use  short  field  procedures.    For  other  than hard-surfaced runways or taxiways, the airfield must be listed in the ASRR as certified or have a current LZ survey.  For contingency operations, waiver of this requirement resides with the mission tasking authority.   44  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 5.15.2.2.  Takeoff.    Minimum  runway  length  is  charted  minimum  field  length  for maximum effort takeoff (MFLMETO).  If runway available is greater than MFLMETO, then  correct  for  one-engine  inoperative  air  minimum  control  speed  in  ground  effect (Vmca). Takeoff will be made at Vmca or Vmeto, whichever is greater. 5.15.2.3.  When  obstacles  are  a  factor,  use  actual  maximum  effort  takeoff  speed  (1.2  x power-on stall  speed)  and climb  out  at maximum effort  obstacle  clearance speed (1.3 x power-on stall speeds). 5.15.2.4.  If  runway  available  is  less  than  MFLMETO  corrected  for  Vmca,  use  Vmeto.  Pilot  may  choose  to  use  runway  remaining  at  Vmeto  to  accelerate  toward  Vmca.  WARNING: Aircraft performance and obstacle clearance is based on obtaining, and then maintaining obstacle clearance speed as quickly as possible. Aircraft performance below obstacle clearance speed may not allow safe clearance of obstacles. 5.15.2.5.  Landing.  Minimum runway length is ground roll plus 500 feet. 5.15.2.6.  Training: 5.15.2.6.1.  Minimum runway length is 3,000 feet. 5.15.2.6.2.  Compute  landing  performance  with  2  engines  in  reverse,  2  engines  in ground idle and full brakes. 5.15.2.6.3.  Takeoff speed will be Vmca or Vmeto, whichever is greater. 5.15.2.6.4.  Obstacle  clearance  speed  will  be  actual  maximum  effort  obstacle clearance speed, or 10 knots above takeoff speed, whichever is greater. 5.15.2.6.5.  Climb  until  clear  of  the  simulated  obstacle  at  obstacle  clearance  speed used. 5.15.2.6.6.  Squadron commanders may authorize the use of actual max effort speeds (takeoff and obstacle clearance) on a case-by-case basis. 5.15.3.  NVG  Operations:    NVG  normal  and  short  field  operations  will  be  conducted  IAW paragraphs 5.15.1 and 5.15.2, respectively.  The following additional guidance applies: 5.15.3.1.  Minimum  runway  length  using  max  effort  procedures  is  ground  roll  plus  500 feet  if  a  500  foot  touchdown  zone  is  clearly  marked  on  the  runway.    If  the  touchdown zone is greater than 500 feet, or unmarked, minimum runway length is  ground roll plus 1,000 feet.     WARNING: On blacked out  runways, a go-around point will be identified during route study. 5.15.3.2.  For  training,  the  minimum  runway  width  is  100  feet  or  30  meters  when  an NVG certified FP/CP lands from the right seat. 5.16.  Operations  over  Arresting  Cables.  (T-1)  Avoid  landing  on  (touching  down  on) arresting cables (does not include recessed cables). If the aircraft lands on or before the cable, the crew will contact the tower to have the cable inspected. 5.16.1.  Operations  are  authorized  on  runways  where  BAK-12  or  similar  systems  are installed, with a minimum of eight tiedowns, without regard to the flight  manual restriction on movement over arresting cables.  The aircraft should cross the cable on runway centerline to  avoid  damage.    When  operating  from  runways  equipped  with  other  types  of  systems,  or AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   45  less  than  eight  tiedowns,  use  sound  judgment  to  avoid  damage  to  the  aircraft.    Maintain appropriate backpressure on the  aircraft  yoke during taxi  operations to  reduce nose landing gear down force. 5.17.  Aircraft  Taxi  Obstruction  Clearance  Criteria:  Without  wing  walkers,  avoid  taxi obstructions by at least 25 feet; with wing walkers, by at least 10 feet.  EXCEPTION: Locally based aircraft may taxi within 10 feet of obstacles without a wing walker when fixed taxi routes are  marked  and  the  obstruction  is  permanent.    Taxi  routes  must  be  used  by  the  same  model aircraft  for  which  they  were  designed  and  in  the  specifically  designed  parking  spots.    Support equipment shall be located in appropriately designated areas (T-1). 5.17.1.  Whenever  taxi  clearance  is  doubtful,  use  a  wing  walker.    If  wing  walkers  are unavailable, deplane a crewmember to ensure obstruction clearance. 5.17.1.1.  Use low speed ground idle when practical.  If foreign object damage (FOD) is a problem,  the  outboard  engines  may  be  shut  down  provided  gross  weight,  taxiway conditions,  and  weather  are  favorable.    Verify  all  sources  of  brake  pressure  before shutting down symmetrical engines. 5.17.1.2.  After  landing  and  clearing  the  runway,  with  the  approval  of  the  PIC,  the loadmaster may open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to 12 inches above horizontal to  prepare  for  cargo  offload  or  onload.    Ensure  all  equipment,  cargo,  and  passengers remain secured in the cargo compartment. 5.18.  Reverse Taxi.  (T-1) 5.18.1.  The  pilot  will  coordinate  engine  status/utilization  with  the  flight  engineer  and  taxi directions and signals with the loadmaster and marshaller prior to commencing reverse taxi operations. 5.18.2.  Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated. 5.18.3.  Open the aft cargo door.  Ramp will be a minimum of 12 inches above horizontal for taxi operations. 5.18.4.  The  loadmaster  will  be  on  the  ramp  in  a  position  to  direct  reverse  taxi,  report  any hazards,  and  provide  the  pilot  with  timely  interphone  instructions  on  turns,  distance remaining,  condition  of  the  maneuvering  area,  and  stopping  point.    CAUTION:    If  a complete  set  of  ground  loading  ramps  or  canary  slides  are  installed,  at  least  one  must  be removed to allow unobstructed vision from the cargo ramp while backing. 5.18.5.  During reverse taxi operations, the pilot and loadmaster will ensure that visibility in the taxi area is sufficient to conduct safe taxi operations.  Avoid taxi obstructions by at least 25 feet, even if using a wing walker. 5.18.6.  Every effort will be made to avoid the need for reverse taxiing during icy or snowy conditions.    If  unavoidable,  extreme  caution  will  be  exercised  and  reverse  taxi  movement will be stopped using throttle control if sliding occurs. 5.19.  Fuel  Jettisoning.  (T-1) Fuel  will  not  be  jettisoned  except  in  combat,  contingency  or emergency conditions missions requiring gross weight reduction. Fuel will not be jettisoned for mission convenience. 5.20.  Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Clearance Criteria (T-1):   46  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 5.20.1.  ASRR Certification Airfields.  Aircraft commanders will not make an approach and landing  into  an  airfield  requiring  certification  by  the  ASRR  unless  they  have  operated  into that airfield in  the last two  years as a pilot,  flight  pilot/copilot, or observer.  See ASRR for certification  requirements.    Waiver  authority  for  certification  airfield  restrictions  is  the OG/CC. 5.20.2.  During  ground  operations  comply  with  AFI  11-218,  Aircraft  Operations  and Movement  on  the  Ground.  For  contingency  operations,  the  WG/CC  may  waive  minimum obstructions  clearances  to  those  shown  in  Figure  5.1  and  5.2  An  airfield  is  considered suitable for C-130 operations when: 5.20.2.1.  No obstructions penetrate outside the shaded area of  Figure  5.1  This ensures obstruction clearance only if the aircraft is maintained within 35 feet of runway centerline and the angle of bank does not exceed 5 degrees. 5.20.2.2.  When an obstruction penetrates outside the shaded area of  Figure  5.1 specific approval by the wing commander or deployed equivalent is required and the AC must be advised  of  the  height  and  location  of  the  obstruction,  as  well  as  specific  procedures  to avoid the obstacle (i.e., landing beyond the obstacle). Figure 5.1.  Obstruction Clearance Criteria. 5.20.2.3.  Figure  5  2  Depicts  minimum  obstruction  clearance  criteria  for  ground operations with the main landing gear on the edge of the operating surface.  ACs will be advised of any known obstructions that penetrate outside the shaded area.  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   47  Figure 5.2.  Minimum Obstruction Clearance Criteria For Ground Operations With The Main Landing Gear On The Edge Of The Operating Surface.  5.21.  Buddy  and  Windmill  Taxi  Starts.  Buddy  and  windmill  taxi  starts  may  be  performed when  required  by  training  syllabus  or  when  approved  by  the  OG/CC.    This  authority  may  be delegated to squadron or mission commanders when the unit is deployed.  This authorization will not  be  construed  to  allow  repeated  buddy  or  windmill  taxi  starts  at  various  scheduled  en  route stops.  Load all passengers after completion of a buddy or windmill taxi start. 5.22.  Inter.  Takeoffs will normally be made from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway.  The decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC and may be accomplished provided the operating environment (i.e. gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather,  etc.) allows a safe takeoff and departure.  Calculate takeoff performance based on the runway remaining from the point at which the takeoff is initiated. 5.23.  Minimum  Engine  Performance.  (T-1)  Minimum  engine  performance  is  95%  engine efficiency.  The first take-off of the day should be a static take-off to verify engine performance. If 95% engine efficiency cannot be obtained on all engines, close engine bleeds and re-compute predicted  torque  to  determine  whether  an  engine  or  bleed  air  malfunction  exists.  In  either  case the aircraft will not be flown. CAUTION:  Prop blast from engine runs is hazardous to people, buildings, equipment, and other aircraft.  Crews will ensure the area behind the aircraft is clear before  starting  an  engine  run.  At  no  time  will  an  engine  run-up  be  attempted  (throttles  out  of ground range) unless the aircraft is  in  an approved engine run-up site or  on the active runway. CAUTION:  Request clearance from  ground control or tower controller prior to an engine run-up.  Clearance from either ground or tower does not constitute a safe environment for an engine run. Advise controller anytime prop wash will cross the runway. 5.24.  Reduced  Power  Operations.  (T-1)  Reduced  power  operations  are  intended  to  prolong engine service life.   48  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 5.24.1.  During  proficiency  flights  (operations  that  are  primarily  confined  to  the  traffic pattern)  and  tactical  events,  TIT  will  normally  be  970  degrees  C  for  takeoff,  not  to  exceed 19,600 inch-pounds of torque.  Higher power settings may be used, as required, and will be briefed by the pilot flying the aircraft. 5.24.2.  Use  maximum  power  for  max  effort  takeoffs  (actual  or  simulated),  not  to  exceed 19,600  inch-pounds  of  torque.    In  order  to  prevent  overtorques  and  if  conditions  permit, torques of less than 19,600 inch-pounds may be used to simulate max power during training. 5.25.  Power  Application  (T-1).  To  help  prevent  overtorques,  the  flight  engineer  will  make  a call  over  interphone  any  time  torque  reaches  17,000  in-lbs.    Pilots  and  flight  engineers  will monitor torque as throttles are advanced. 5.26.  Three-Engine  Takeoffs.  (T-1)  Actual  engine-out  takeoffs  require  MAJCOM/A3  or deployed equivalent waiver 5.27.  Aircraft  Recovery  from  Unprepared  Surfaces  (T-1).  Aircrews  should  not  attempt  to recover  an  aircraft  after  inadvertent  entry  onto  surfaces  that  are  not  suitable  for  taxi.    Ground crews using appropriate equipment will normally recover the aircraft.  Aircrews may recover the aircraft  at  austere  locations  if,  after  thorough  inspection,  the  PIC  is  sure  there  is  no  aircraft damage and the surface will support the aircraft. 5.28.  Engines  Running  Onload  or  Offload  (ERO).  (T-1)  There  are types  of onload/offload  operations.  They  are  Normal  Engine  Running  Onload/Offload  (ERO)  and infil/exfil  operations  (rapids).    Use  EROs  whenever  practical  and  time  is  not  critical.    The paragraphs below discuss normal ERO procedures.  See paragraph 5.29 for Rapids procedures.  NOTE:    Do  not  use  ERO  procedures  when  explosive  cargo  (Hazard  class  1.1-1.4)  is  involved unless authorized by the JA/ATT or exercise operation order or contingency air tasking orders.  If AFTER LANDING Checklist is used, the ERO checklist need not be run for hot brake/hung flare checks. two 5.28.1.  The  ERO  procedures  in  this  paragraph  may  be  used  for  any  mix  of  personnel  or cargo. The aft cargo door and ramp is preferred when more than 10 passengers are involved. PICs will assess prevailing weather, lighting, and parking location to ensure safe operations. 5.28.2.  General Procedures: 5.28.2.1.  PICs  will  brief  crewmembers  on  the  intended  ERO  operation,  emphasizing specific crewmember duties. 5.28.2.2.  The parking brake will be set and one pilot will monitor brakes, interphone, and radio. 5.28.2.3.  Operate engines in ground idle (low speed, if applicable). If conditions warrant, open air deflector doors and adjust flaps to further reduce prop blast. 5.28.2.4.  Turn wing leading edge lights on during night EROs. Taxi lights may be used at the discretion of the PIC. 5.28.2.5.  Complete  passenger  and  cargo  manifests,  crew  lists,  and  DD  Form  365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance, Form F, for the subsequent sortie.   NOTE: DD Form 365-4 is not required for the subsequent sortie if the aircraft will depart empty. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   49  5.28.2.6.  Resume taxi after the LM has verbally acknowledged that the aircraft is ready to taxi. 5.28.2.7.  Do  not  onload  or  offload  through  the  crew  entrance  door  and  ramp,  or paratroop  doors,  simultaneously.    WARNING:  Due  to  the  hazards  involved  (i.e.,  prop blast,  proximity  to  engines  and  props,  lack  of  paratroop  door  steps,  etc.),  only  hand transferable  items  of  cargo  may  be  onloaded  or  offloaded  through  the  paratroop  doors during EROs. 5.28.3.  Personnel onload and offload through the crew entrance door. 5.28.3.1.  The PIC will give clearance to open the crew entrance door. 5.28.3.2.  During  onload  and  offload,  station  a  crewmember  (normally  the  LM)  on interphone  (cord  held  taut)  approximately  25  feet  and  at  a  45-degree  angle  from  the aircraft axis. 5.28.3.3.  Brief deplaning personnel to remain forward of the interphone cord. 5.28.4.  Personnel or cargo onload and offload through the aft cargo door and ramp. 5.28.4.1.  After  the  aircraft  has  slowed  to  taxi  speed,  the  LM  may  remove  all  tiedowns except  one  forward  and  one  aft  restraint.  Remove  remaining  restraints  only  after  the aircraft  is  stopped  and  vehicle  drivers  are  in  place.  Drivers  will  not  release  vehicle parking brakes until all restraints are removed and cleared to proceed by the LM. 5.28.4.2.  Upon clearance from the PIC, open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to 12 inches above horizontal. 5.28.4.3.  The LM will direct all onload and offload operations using prebriefed signals. Passengers  will  be  escorted  by  a  crewmember  when  emplaning  or  deplaning.  Deplane passengers before cargo and enplane passengers after cargo unless cargo size or location dictates  otherwise.    NOTE:  Does  not  apply  to  infil/exfil  operations.  During  infil/exfil operations onload and offload cargo as static trained. 5.28.4.4.  Other  qualified  LMs  may  direct  the  operation,  if  available,  but  the  crew loadmaster retains overall responsibility for the operation. 5.28.4.5.  Station  the crew loadmaster or another crewmember on interphone and PA in the  cargo  compartment  as  a  safety  observer.  Safety  observers  other  than  the  LM  will remain forward of all cargo. 5.28.5.  ERO  for  crew  changes  during  local  training  missions  is  authorized  provided  the enplaning  crew  does  not  approach  the  aircraft  until  the  deplaning  LM  on  headset  is  in position outside the aircraft. 5.29.  Combat  Loading.  (T-1)  Combat  loading  is  comprised  of  three  types  of  operations: combat  offload,  passenger  combat  loading,  and  infil/exfil  operations  (rapids).    See  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130  for  additional  guidance.    All  personnel  in  the  cargo  compartment  will  be  seated  and secured except those personnel having valid duties to perform. 5.29.1.  Combat off-load.  Combat off-load provides a means of off-loading single, multiple, and  married  pallets;  ramp  and  airdrop  platforms;  and  CDS  containers  without  the  use  of Material Handling Equipment (MHE).  Directors of operations or mission commanders may   50  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 authorize  combat  off-load  when  hostile  conditions  or  similar  situations  warrant  the  use  of these procedures.  Basic qualified crews can use combat off-load procedures.  NOTE: Only HC-130 aircraft modified with dual rails may conduct combat off-load operations. 5.29.2.  Passenger  Combat  Loading.    Additional  procedures  are  located  in  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130.  Floor loading is authorized to support dedicated forces and foreign counterparts during operations,  exercises,  and  training.    Standard  seating  configurations  listed  in  AFI  11-2HC-130V3,  Addendum  A,  HC-130  Configuration/Mission  Planning,  are  recommended,  if practical. 5.29.2.1.  When  airlifting  litter  patients,  position  the  litters  longitudinally  with  patients’ heads aft and secure each of the litters with a tiedown strap.  When injuries do not permit adequate  lateral  restraint  to  prevent  longitudinal  movement,  a  medical  technician  or designated  individual  may  provide  additional  restraint.  The  PIC  will  be  notified  when personnel are not seated and secured for takeoff and landing. 5.29.2.1.1.  For  one  litter,  hook  the  tiedown  strap  into  a  floor  ring,  run  laterally, wrapping the strap around each litter handle once, hook the ratchet end to the nearest to the nearest tiedown ring, and tighten. 5.29.2.1.2.  For two litters side by side, use two tiedown straps for each end. Center the  inboard  handle  of  each  litter  over  the  same  ring  and  hook  the  hook  end  of  each strap to the same ring(into "D" row rings unless mission dictates otherwise), run the straps laterally, one left and one right, over each outboard litter handle to the nearest tiedown ring, and tighten. 5.29.2.1.3.  For three litters side by side, wrap the straps around adjacent handles. 5.29.3.  Infil/Exfil operations. Infil/exfil operations are a tactical method of on-loading or off-loading dedicated unconventional and rescue/special operations forces. Spring-loaded, latch-activated, folding ramps (canary slides) or ground loading ramps are used to off-load and on-load vehicles and/or personnel in minimum time. 5.29.3.1.  Egress  and  Static  Load  Training.  Conduct  static  load  training  prior  to  all Infil/Exfil operations.  EXCEPTION:  For unilateral  Infil/Exfil training conducted with home-station  assigned  units  using  All-Terrain  Vehicles  (ATV),  Quads,  Polaris,  Gator type vehicles, the OG/CC may waive this requirement. 5.29.3.2.  Vehicle  Restraint  Procedures.    User  will  identify  any  "load  specific"  tiedown requirements or limitations. 5.29.3.3.  LMs will wear NVGs during blacked-out rapid infil/exfil operations. 5.29.3.4.  Procedures after Touchdown: 5.29.3.4.1.  Open the cargo ramp and door to horizontal when the pilot states, "Clear To  Open,"  or  as  prebriefed.  Lower  the  ramp  to  the  ground  once  the  aircraft  has stopped,  parking  break  has  been  set  and  the  pilot  states,  "Clear  To  Offload."  CAUTION: Maintain positive control of canary slides/ground loading ramps. 5.29.3.4.2.  Position  canary  slides/ground  loading  ramps.    NOTE:  If  a  time  delay  is anticipated before onloading, raise the ramp enough to allow the aircraft to taxi in the event of an emergency. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   51  5.29.3.4.3.  Complete offload/onload. 5.29.3.4.4.  Raise canary slides/ground loading ramps. 5.29.3.4.5.  Raise the ramp to approximately 12” above horizontal. 5.29.3.4.6.  Notify the pilot, "Clear To Taxi." 5.29.3.4.7.  Secure canary slides/ground loading ramps. 5.29.3.4.8.  Close the ramp and door. 5.29.3.4.9.  Turn on the red or NVG-compatible lights. 5.29.3.4.10.  Prior  to  takeoff,  ensure  vehicles/equipment,  personnel  and  exits  are secure, and warning lights are extinguished. 5.29.3.4.11.  Connect/engage ADS arms after takeoff as soon as mission requirements allow. 5.29.3.4.12.  Check  vehicle  tiedowns  and  secure  cargo  compartment  after  takeoff  as soon as mission requirements allow.   52  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 Chapter 6 GENERAL OPERATING PROCEDURES Section 6A—Pre-Mission 6.1.

Refer to the appropriate briefing guides for content. 6.10.2.  Crewmembers will not fly unless they attend the crew briefings for their mission (T-2).    EXCEPTION:  When  premission  requirements  dictate,  PIC  may  excuse  certain crewmembers from the briefing.  The PIC will ensure that those personnel receive a face-to-face briefing prior to engine start. 6.11.  Call Signs.  Use Voice Call Sign Listing (VCSL) or as specified in mission directives for all  missions  except  local  area  training  missions.  Use  squadron  or  wing  static  call  signs  as directed for local area training missions. 6.11.1.  Aeromedical Evacuation.  Preface normal call sign with “AIR EVAC” when patients are on board. 6.11.2.  Search  and  Rescue  (SAR).    When  tasked  to  participate  in  SAR  operations,  use  the call sign “AIR FORCE RESCUE” plus the last five digits of the aircraft tail number. 6.12.  Instrument  Flight  Rules.  Conduct  flight  operations  under  IFR  to  the  maximum  extent possible  without  unacceptable  mission  degradation.  This  does  not  preclude  VFR  training  to maintain proficiency in mission essential VFR operations. 6.13.  Sensitive Mission Operations.  (T-1) 6.13.1.  Certain  missions  require  special  flight  planning  procedures  or  deceptive  measures.  Mission  operating  directives,  MAJCOM/CC  operations  orders,  or  other  tasking  orders  will direct use of these procedures. Aircrews will be briefed on modification to normal procedures prior  to  execution  of  the  operation.    The  MAJCOM/CC  or  COMAFFOR  will  approve missions requiring coordination with non-ACC agencies prior to execution.   58  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 6.13.2.  The  planning  agency  tasked  with  the  mission  will  provide  the  aircrew  with  the following information: 6.13.2.1.  Departure procedures. 6.13.2.2.  En route procedures to include tracks, ALTRVs, MARSA, tanker rendezvous, and emergency divert procedures. 6.13.2.3.  Arrival procedures. 6.13.2.4.  All communications requirements. 6.14.  Due  Regard  Procedures.  When  a  unit  commander  authorizes  a  mission  to  be  flown  in international  airspace  over  the  high  seas,  and  in-flight  operational  requirements  conflict  with ICAO  rules  and  procedures,  the  PIC  may  make  the  decision  to  proceed  using  Due  Regard procedures in accordance with AFI 11-202V3 and FLIP GP. 6.15.  Flight  Plan  Verification.  (T-1)    Regardless  of  whether  a  flight  plan  is  prepared  by  the aircrew  or  furnished  by  another  aircrew  or  agency,  the  PIC  and  navigator  will  jointly  verify routing, altitudes, terrain clearance, airspace deconfliction, cargo, and fuel load prior to filing the flight  plan.  On  overseas  flights,  verify  the  flight  planned  routing  against  the  diplomatic clearance,  if  applicable.  The  navigator  who  prepares  or  accepts  the  flight  plan  will  remain  on duty at the navigator’s station during departure and will brief the relieving navigator thoroughly on all en route and destination hazards. 6.16.  Takeoff  and  Landing  Data  (TOLD)  Verification.  (T-1)    The  flight  engineer  will complete the AF  IMT Form  4064,  C-130  Takeoff  and  Landing  Data  Card, and the AF  IMT Form 4063, Pilot Information Card, or locally developed version, in accordance with Chapter 12.  A  pilot  crewmember  or  additional  flight  engineer  will  cross  check  the  TOLD  data  for accuracy by using the performance manual,  TOLD  computer, or approved tabulated data. As a minimum, the person checking the data will: 6.16.1.  Verify gross weight independently from the AF IMT Form 4063/4064. 6.16.2.  Cross-check air minimum control Vmca (one engine inop in ground effect), takeoff, and landing speeds. 6.16.3.  Review  and  compare  the  computed  distances,  ground  roll,  and  climb  gradient  (if applicable) with the actual conditions, runway available, and departure procedures. 6.17.  Fuel  Planning.  (T-1)  Accomplish  fuel  planning  in  accordance  with  certified  automated flight planning software or applicable aircraft performance manual. See Chapter 11. 6.17.1.  Use  primary  fuel  management,  in  accordance  with  the  aircraft  flight  manual, whenever practical. 6.17.2.  Add extra fuel: 6.17.2.1.  When  extra  fuel  is  unavailable  at  en  route  stops;  when  compressed  ground times during single-day, multi-sortie missions preclude refueling at each en route stop; or, when en route refueling would delay or be detrimental to mission accomplishment. 6.17.2.2.  When passengers or patients are on board, to recover to a suitable airfield from the Equal Time Point (ETP) at 10,000 feet MSL in the event of unpressurized flight. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   59  6.17.3.  Fuel  Conservation.  Aircrews  and  mission  planners  will  manage  aviation  fuel  as  a limited  commodity  and  precious  resource.  Fuel  optimization  will  be  considered  throughout all phases of mission planning and execution. Aircrews should employ the following aviation fuel  optimization  measures  without  compromising jeopardizing mission/training accomplishment: flight  safety  or 6.17.3.1.  Optimize  fuel  loads.  Mission  plan  for  the  required  ramp  and  recovery  fuel. Excessive  ramp  and  recovery  fuel  adds  to  aircraft  gross  weight  and  increases  fuel consumption. 6.17.3.2.  Minimize  aircraft  weight  through  reduction  of  equipment  not  necessary  for mission accomplishment. 6.17.3.3.  Use low speed ground idle or two engine symmetrical power when practical for ground operation. 6.17.3.4.  Cruise at optimum altitude.  Step climb if practical. 6.17.3.5.  Fly  missions  at  the  most  fuel  conservative  cruise  speed  option.    On  missions that  are  time-  rather  than  distance-oriented,  consider  flying  the  lowest  practical  cruise option.  Aircraft commanders are encouraged to fly long-range cruise airspeeds on other missions, if practical. 6.17.3.6.  Cruise  at  the  altitude  that  gives  the  best  ground  distance  traveled  for  each pound  of  fuel  consumed.    As  a  technique,  climb  if  ground  speed  is  reduced  less  than  5 knots  for  each  1,000  feet  of  altitude  increase.    Descend  if  ground  speed  will  increase more  than  5  knots  for  each  1,000  feet  of  altitude  decrease.    Do  not  fly  above  cruise ceiling. 6.18.  Required Fuel  At Destination.  (T-1) Minimum fuel overhead destination or alternate is 7,000 pounds. Land with a minimum of 6,000 pounds fuel remaining. 6.19.  Departure  Planning.  Use  AFI  11-202V3,  AFMAN  11-217V1,  Instrument  Flight Procedures, AFMAN 11-217V2, Visual Flight Rules, this chapter; and the appropriate MAJCOM supplements.  Regardless  of  the  type  of  departure  flown  (IFR/VFR),  review  the  following  (as appropriate):  IFR  Departure  Procedure,  instrument  approach  plate,  NOTAMS,  GDSS  Giant Report, and suitable terrain charts. 16.19.1.  The  PIC  will  provide  the  flight  engineer  with  the  obstacle  height,  distance,  and gradient  information  necessary  to  calculate  performance  computations  for  departure, alternate, and destination airfields (T-1). 16.19.2.  Alternate Takeoff Minima are authorized IAW Table 6.4 Table 6.4.  Alternative Takeoff Minima and Departure Alternate Procedures. If departure weather is:  Departure is: At or above authorized ceiling and visibility landing minimums. Authorized A departure alternate is: Not required    60  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 Below either authorized ceiling or visibility minimums and RVR is 1600 or greater (visibility ¼ miles or greater): Authorized for Operational Missions only Required (see notes 1 and 2)  Required (see notes 1, 2 and 3)  Authorized for operational missions only Below either authorized ceiling or visibility minimums and RVR is less than 1600 but equal to or greater than 1000.   Notes: 1.  To qualify as a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:     a.  Alternate must be located within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1 hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400).  -OR-     b.  Alternate must be located within 2 hours flying time, with weather to be at least 500-1 above the approach minimums, but no lower than 700-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach for ETA at the alternate +/- 1 hour.  2.  Aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA to the alternate using one engine inoperative (OEI) performance criteria.  3.  Departure runway must have operational centerline lighting and dual RVR readouts and displays for both the approach and departure end of runway (RVR must be at or greater than 1000 at both the approach end and departure end and runway). For runways with triple RVR readouts, the pilot may use any two consecutive read-outs to determine if the runway is usable for departure (aircraft performance permitting).  For example: Approach end RVR=800, midfield RVR=1200, departure end RVR=1000. If aircraft performance and runway length will permit taking off at midfield, this runway is usable for takeoff.  6.20.  Departure Climbout.  Comply with AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1/V2, and published departure procedures for IFR and VFR Departures requirements. 6.21.  Operation  in  the  Vicinity  of  Hazards.  (T-1)  Aircraft  will  not  be  operated  in  any forecasted or actual severe condition (e.g. severe icing, turbulence, etc). 6.21.1.  Avoid thunderstorms and cumulonimbus clouds (CBs) using the following criteria: 6.21.1.1.  Climb Out, En route, and Descent: 6.21.1.1.1.  FL 230 and Above: 20 NM. 6.21.1.1.2.  Below FL 230: 10 NM. 6.21.1.1.3.  Low level operations: 5 NM. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   61  6.21.1.1.4.  Avoid the rain shaft and cloud base of thunderstorms and CBs using the aforementioned criteria.  WARNING: Do not  fly  under the anvil of a cumulonimbus cloud. 6.21.1.1.5.  Clear  the  top  of  a  known  or  suspected  severe  thunderstorm  by  at  least 1,000 feet altitude for each 10 knots of wind speed at the cloud top. Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a rapidly moving thunderstorm. 6.21.1.1.6.  Avoid thunderstorms visually, by airborne radar, or by specific request of a ground-based radar with a weather painting capability. When relying exclusively on ground-based  radar  for  weather  avoidance  and  the  ground  controller  is  unable  to provide avoidance instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by: 6.21.1.1.6.1.  Changing routing. 6.21.1.1.6.2.  Diverting to alternate. 6.21.1.1.6.3.  Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance if unable to  maintain VMC  in  an  area of significant  weather and the  ground radar  facility cannot provide weather avoidance service. 6.21.1.1.7.  The  use  of  ground-based  radar  as  the  primary  means  of  thunderstorm avoidance  should  be  used  only  to  depart  an  area  of  significant  weather.  It  should never be considered a normal avoidance procedure. 6.21.1.2.  Takeoff,  Approach,  and  Landing.  IAW  MAJCOM  guidance.    See  AFI  11-202V3  as  supplemented.    EXCEPTION:    If  MAJCOM  guidance  does  not  exist,  the following restrictions will be observed. 6.21.1.2.1.  In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast: 6.21.1.2.1.1.  Attempt to maintain VMC. 6.21.1.2.1.2.  Maintain at least 5NMs separation from heavy rain showers. 6.21.1.2.1.3.  Avoid  areas  of  high  lightning  potential,  i.e.,  clouds  within  plus  or minus 5,000 feet of the freezing level or plus or minus 8°C of the freezing level. 6.21.1.2.2.  Approaches or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within  10NMs  providing  they  are  not  producing  any  hazardous  conditions  (such  as hail,  lightning,  strong  winds,  gusts  fronts,  heavy  rain,  wind  shear,  or  microburst)  at the airport, and are not forecast or observed to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include the planned missed approach corridor, if applicable). 6.21.2.  Lightning  Avoidance.  The  following  conditions  are  most  conducive  to  lightning strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided: 6.21.2.1.  Within 8°C of freezing. 6.21.2.2.  In  clouds  or  in  any  intensity  of  precipitation  or  turbulence  associated  with thunderstorm activity. 6.22.  Arrival  Planning.  Comply  with  AFI  11-202V3  for  destination  and  alternate  weather requirements.   62  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 6.23.  Risk  Management  (RM).  (T-1)  Risk  is  inherent  in  flying  operations  but  should  be minimized consistent with achieving mission accomplishment and training objectives. 6.23.1.  Ops  Group  commanders  will  develop  RM  guidelines  to  identify  and  mitigate acceptable levels  of risk for performing contingency and training operations.  USAF policy on RM is contained in AFI 90-802 Risk Management. 6.23.2.  PICs  will  accomplish  RM  assessment  IAW  local  guidance  as  part  of  preflight activities. Section 6C—Preflight 6.24.  Preflight.  (T-1)  The  pre-flight  inspection  is  a  flight  preparedness  inspection  done  in accordance  with  the  -6  maintenance  requirements  manual  and  the  -1  flight  manual  (as applicable).    The  pre-flight  inspection  includes  visually  examining  the  aerospace  vehicle  and operationally checking certain systems and components to ensure there are no serious defects or malfunctions. 6.24.1.  A preflight will be required prior to the first flight of the flying period, or when the preflight validity period has expired, or a maintenance dash six preflight is performed. 6.24.2.  Aircraft  Dash  One  Preflight  Inspection  Requirements.  The  aircraft  dash  one preflight inspection will remain valid until  aircraft ground time exceeds 12-hours (72-hours provided the aircraft is sealed (with a boxcar seal), not flown, and documented entry control is maintained).   Refer to paragraph 6.25 for alert aircraft requirements. 6.24.3.  Dash  One  preflight  inspections  are  normally  done  in  preparation  for  flight  by  the aircrew assigned to fly the mission designated for that aircraft.  Having a partial aircrew, not scheduled to fly, accomplish multiple preflights on aircraft not scheduled for the next day’s mission should not normally be accomplished, except to prepare for UEIs, and contingencies. 6.24.4.  When  an  aerospace  vehicle  is  mobilizing  for  deployment,  units  are  authorized  to place the aerospace vehicle on alert status. It must be prepared in accordance with established technical  orders,  accepted  by  an  aircrew,  remain  under  the  control  of  operations,  and  be monitored by maintenance. When sealing an aerospace vehicle, accomplish a complete pre-flight  inspection  prior  to  sealing  the  aircraft  and  again  before  flight  after  completion  of  the alert  status  if  the  pre-  flight  validity  period  has  been  exceeded.  Consequently,  further preflight inspection or certification of a pre-flight inspection is not required during the alert period. 6.24.5.  When placing an aerospace vehicle on alert status, accomplish a complete pre-flight inspection prior to going on alert and again before flight after completion of the alert period if the pre-flight validity period has been exceeded. Consequently, further preflight inspection or  certification  of  a  pre-flight  inspection  is  not  required  during  the  alert  period.  (Placing  a unit on alert does not in itself place the unit’s aerospace vehicle on alert status). 6.24.6.  When  an  aircrew  assumes  a  preflighted  spare  or  quick-turn,  a  thorough  visual inspection will be performed, paying particular attention to areas affected by maintenance or servicing. 6.25.  Alert Aircraft.  (T-1)  Maintain aircraft on alert status as follows: AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   63  6.25.1.  Park the aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite taxi and takeoff. 6.25.2.  Whenever operationally feasible, have a crew other than the alert crew preflight the alert aircraft. If this is not feasible, follow procedures outlined in paragraph 3.6.5 6.25.3.  Aircraft  preflight  times  should  align  with  the  alert  period  and  aircraft  preflight validity period, eliminating the need to update the preflight during the alert period. 6.25.4.  The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual alert missions provided the following conditions are met: 6.25.4.1.  Alert  requirements  can  be  met  with  sufficient  fuel  to  meet  mission requirements. 6.25.4.2.  Communication contact is maintained with the primary controlling agency. 6.25.4.3.  Controlling  agencies  are  notified  any  time  the  alert  aircraft  departs  the  local area. 6.25.4.4.  The provisions of paragraph 3.6.5.2 are followed. 6.25.5.  Maintenance Thru-Flight Inspections. 6.25.5.1.  IAW T.O. 00-20-1, the maintenance thru-flight inspection is a between flights inspection  and  will  be  accomplished  after  each  flight  when  a  turnaround  sortie, continuation flight or continuation of alert is scheduled and a basic post-flight inspection is not required.  The thru-flight inspection consists of checking the aerospace vehicle for flight continuance by performing visual examination and/or operational checks of certain components,  areas,  or  systems,  according  to  established  TOs  to  ensure  that  no  defects exist which would be detrimental to further flight. 6.25.5.2.  If maintenance actions are not required, (Alpha-1), the aircraft can be resealed for alert once the aircraft servicing is complete.  A new aircrew preflight is not required until the end of the preflight validity period (72 hours). 6.25.5.3.  If maintenance actions are required (Alpha-2) and the preflight validity period has  time  remaining,  the  aircrew  may  reseal  the  aircraft  after  thorough  inspection  of maintenance actions. 6.25.5.4.  If  prolonged  maintenance  is  required  (Alpha-3),  the  Squadron/Deployed Commander  will  release  the  aircraft  to  maintenance  for  repairs.   Normally  a  complete maintenance  Dash  Six  and  aircrew  Dash  One  pre-flights  are  required  if  major maintenance  is  accomplished.  If  minor  maintenance  is  accomplished  and  the  aircraft  is capable  of  returning  to  alert  status  within  normal  turnaround  times,  the  flight  engineer may  inspect  the  affected  area  and  place  the  aircraft  back  on  alert  status  provided  time remains on the alert preflight validity period. 6.25.6.  Should  the  aircraft  remain  on  alert  for  more  than  72  hours,  a  complete  aircrew preflight is required. 6.25.7.  Entry Procedures.  The purpose of sealing an aircraft is to protect from unauthorized entry.    A  sealed,  alert  aircraft  is  off-limits  to  all  personnel  except  alert  crewmembers.    If entry is necessary for maintenance, the DO/Ops Sup and MX/Pro Sup will be notified of the entry.    The  aircraft  must  be  resealed  upon  completion  of  any  required  actions  and  the  new   64  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 seal number documented in the Form 781A.  In the absence of this documentation, consider the  Dash-1  preflight  invalid  and  accomplish  a  new  preflight.    Re-accomplish  the  -9 inspection when required IAW T.O. 1C-130A-9. 6.25.8.  A DD Form 365-4 will be prepared for the alert aircraft. Alert crews are authorized to prepare a TOLD card using the worst weather conditions expected for the alert period. Use the TOLD data for alert scrambles. If the alert aircraft is flown for other reasons, use TOLD for the existing weather conditions. 6.25.9.  When  a  preflighted  alert  aircraft  changes,  or  an  alert  crew  change  occurs  and  the same  aircraft  remains  on  alert,  the  oncoming  crew  will,  as  a  minimum,  apply  power  to  the aircraft and check applicable items listed below: 6.25.9.1.  Aircraft  Forms;  AFTO  Form  781A,  Maintenance  Discrepancy  and  Work Document,  AFTO  781H,  Aerospace  Vehicle  Flight  Status  and  Maintenance,  and AFTO 781K,  Aerospace  Vehicle  Inspection,  Engine  Data,  Calendar  Inspection  and Delayed Discrepancy Document. 6.25.9.2.  Interior and exterior for proper configuration and special equipment. 6.25.9.3.  Fuel quantity. 6.25.9.4.  Survival and emergency equipment. 6.25.9.5.  Navigation and communication equipment. 6.25.9.6.  Liquid oxygen quantity. 6.25.9.7.  Hydraulic reservoirs and accumulator charges. 6.25.9.8.  Publications. 6.25.10.  Once  the  aircraft  is  accepted  for  alert,  the  flight  engineer  will  ensure  an  entry  is made  in  the  AFTO  Form  781A  stating  at  a  minimum  the  date  and  time  the  aircraft  was preflighted. 6.26.  AFTO Form 781. 6.26.1.  Review the aircraft forms before applying power to the aircraft or operating aircraft systems.  The exceptional release (ER) must be signed before flight.  A maintenance officer, maintenance  superintendent,  or  authorized  civilian  normally  signs  the  ER.    If  one  of  these individuals  is  not  available,  the  PIC  may  sign  the  ER.    Ensure  that  the  DD1896,  Jet  Fuel Identaplate and AIR card are on board the aircraft. 6.26.2.  One-Time Flights.  An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to another  station.    Refer  to  T.O.  00-20-1,  Aerospace  Equipment  Maintenance  Inspection, Documentation,  Policies,  and  Procedures,  for  downgrade  authority  and  procedures.    One-time flight approval authority is HQ ACC/A3.  The PIC's concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown. 6.26.2.1.  For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support refer to Chapter 12. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   65  6.26.2.2.  The  chief  of  maintenance,  the  senior  maintenance  officer,  or  the  chief  of  the AFMC repair team must first authorize the release. 6.26.2.3.  After the maintenance release is obtained, contact HQ ACC/A3, via Stan/Eval channels, for flight authorization.  AFRC crews also see AFI 11-202V3/AFRCSUP1. 6.27.  IFF/SIF Operations.  (T-1)  Perform a ground check of the IFF/SIF before takeoff, using either the self-test or ground radar interrogator. 6.27.1.  If  the  self-test  fails  and  radar  facilities  do  not  permit  a  ground  check,  takeoff  is authorized if the IFF/SIF was operational on the previous mission.  Accomplish an airborne check immediately after takeoff. 6.27.2.  Aircraft will not depart with an inoperative IFF/SIF without the approval of ATC and the PIC (EXCEPTION: Formations must have at least one operational IFF/SIF per element).  If mode 4 fails in-flight, the IFF/SIF unit will be repaired prior to the next flight and/or the aircraft will land for repairs, except for the following: 6.27.2.1.  Missions  that  are  generated  within  CONUS  and  do  not  plan  to  penetrate  the ADIZ. 6.27.2.2.  Non-training peacetime missions where cancellation or return to base for mode 4 failure would seriously degrade mission effectiveness (i.e., presidential support, disaster relief, SAR, aeromedical evacuation, etc.) 6.27.2.3.  Use  the  IFF/SIF  in  accordance  with  Table  6.5    NOTE:    Once  set  and transmitted,  IFF/SIF  modes  1,  2,  and  3/A  codes  are  unclassified  and  may  be  left  in  the transponder.

Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. 6.28.1.  Aircraft  Refueling.    Crewmembers  qualified  in  refueling  may  perform  refueling duties at austere locations or at stations without maintenance support.  Crew chiefs should be scheduled  on  those  missions  where  a  need  is  anticipated.    Two  qualified  personnel  are   66  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 required.  Aircrews should not refuel except in cases when maintenance support is not readily available and the mission would be delayed. 6.28.1.1.  Concurrent  Ground Operations.  Simultaneous aircraft refueling/defueling  and cargo loading or maintenance operations are authorized in  accordance with T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static grounding/Bonding.  Refueling or defueling with  passengers  or  patients  on  board  is  only  authorized  for  aeromedical  evacuation missions. 6.28.1.2.  FARP/Hot  Gas  Operations.    Refer  to  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130  and  Chapter  18  of this instruction. 6.28.2.  Under no conditions are crewmembers allowed to service liquid oxygen. 6.29.  Fire  Protection  and  Crash  Rescue.  (T-1)  The  aircraft  engine  fire  extinguisher  system fulfills the minimum requirements for fire protection during engine start.  If available, position a portable fire extinguisher for added fire protection. 6.29.1.  A fireguard is required for all engine starts including the GTC/APU.  A crewmember or ground controller may act as fireguard. 6.29.2.  Aircrew/Maintenance  Engine  Runs.    Mixed  aircrew/maintenance  engine  runs  will not  normally  be  accomplished.  If  conducted,  Crews  will  adhere  to  flight  manual  operating limits and procedures. 6.30.  Towing.  (T-2)  Aircrew members will not normally participate in towing operations.  The PIC will coordinate with the senior maintenance  officer or superintendent to  ensure the towing supervisor and crew are qualified.  At non-USAF installations, the PIC must have approval from the  airfield  operations  officer  or  manager  prior  to  towing.    The  PIC  will  ensure  the  tow  team supervisor briefs all personnel on their duties and the associated hazards.  Proper checklists will be  used.    If  any  doubt  exists  as  to  the  qualification  of  tow  team  personnel  or  the  safety  of  the operation, make no attempt to tow the aircraft until qualified Air Force personnel can be located.  Under no circumstances will any crewmember act as the towing supervisor. 6.31.  Aircrew Flight Equipment and and Oxygen Requirements.  (T-1)  Prior to flight, The PIC or designated representative will ensure appropriate serviceable protective clothing, aircrew flight equipment, survival equipment, and Dash 21 equipment for the entire mission are available and all personnel are briefed or trained in their use. Prior to departing home station and following enroute crew changes, review the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, to ensure  all  required  equipment  is  on  board  and  required  inspections  have  been  completed. Crewmembers discovering equipment  missing will  make an entry in  both  the AFTO Form 781 and AFTO Form 46. 6.31.1.  Oxygen.  Oxygen on board must be sufficient to accomplish the planned flight from the  equal  time  point  should  oxygen  be  required.    Oxygen  onboard  for  takeoff  will  be  a minimum  of  5.0  liters  per  functional  LOX  converter.    On  missions  with  passengers,  carry passenger  emergency  oxygen  systems  (POK,  EPOS,  or  other  approved  system)  if  flight above FL 250 is anticipated.  Do not block access to these systems during flight.  Distribute and demonstrate proper use prior to climbing through FL 250.  The POK does not protect the wearer from smoke or fumes. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   67  6.31.2.  Crewmembers occupying a primary crew station will accomplish a communications and operations check of their oxygen equipment prior to flight.  Crewmembers will preflight their  planned  source  of  oxygen  (Quick  Don  and/or  helmet  and  mask)  to  include communications checks. All flight deck crewmembers will use the quick don as the primary oxygen source when using headset. All flight deck crewmembers will use the oxygen mask as the primary oxygen source when using the helmet.  The pilot, copilot, and flight engineer will be properly connected to the mask interphone system for all phases of flight.  The quick don or oxygen mask will remain readily available for use from before engine start until after engine shutdown. 6.31.3.  Walk-around  bottles  will  not  be  considered  as  a  primary  source  of  supplemental oxygen for crewmembers performing duties in a primary crew position.  Furthermore, walk-around  bottles  will  not  be  considered  as  a  source  of  supplemental  oxygen  for  any crewmember during unpressurized operations requiring supplemental  oxygen.  See AFI 11-202V3 as supplemented and Chapter 17. 6.31.4.  Rafts.    Ensure  sufficient  wing  well  life  rafts  are  on  board  to  accommodate  all passengers and aircrew members on overwater flights. 6.31.5.  Life  Preserver  Units  (LPUs).    For  overwater  flights,  ensure  a  sufficient  quantity  of life  preservers  are  on  board  for  all  passengers  and  crewmembers.    While  overwater,  LPUs will  be  sized  and  readily  available  at  the  crewmember’s  station,  and  worn  whenever  below 2,000 feet overwater (except for takeoff and landing).  Crewmembers wearing a parachute or harness  during  air  refueling  overwater  will  also  wear  an  LPU.    For  overwater  missions carrying  children  and  infants,  ensure  appropriate  number  and  types  of  LPUs  are  on  board.  NOTE:  Parachutists will provide their own LPUs.  The flying unit will ensure the supported unit is aware when route of flight requires the use of LPUs.   NOTE:  Infil/Exfil operations may preclude issuing aircraft LPUs to user personnel.  In this case ensure sufficient LPUs are onboard for all personnel. 6.31.6.  Anti-exposure  suits.    Anti-exposure  suits  will  be  available  during  overwater  flights when  route  of  flight  is  beyond  power  off  gliding  distance  from  land  and  the  water temperature  is  60  degrees  F  or  below  (NOTE:  Anti-exposure  suits  are  not  required  when only the approach or departure is flown over water).  If the water temperature ranges between 51 degrees F and 60 degrees F, the unit or mission commander may waive or extend the anti-exposure suit requirement after carefully considering all risk factors. 6.31.7.  Parachutes.    HC-130  aircraft  will  be  configured  with  parachutes  as  directed  by MAJCOM  guidance.  Reference  AFI  11-301  as  supplemented.    Units  will  dictate  use  of parachutes during combat or acceptance flights. 6.31.8.  Restraint  Harness.  Personnel  performing  duties  near  an  open  door  in-flight  will preflight  and  wear  a  parachute  or  restraining  harness.    Wear  a  restraining  harness  during operations below 1000 feet AGL. 6.31.8.1.  During  training,  loadmasters  will  wear  a  restraint  harness  when  performing duties near an open exit in flight.  Fit the restraint harness and adjust the lifeline prior to flight.  NOTE:  Connect the lifeline to a point that will preclude the wearer from exiting the  aircraft.    Restraint  harness  lifelines  may  be  attached  to  an  unused  anchor  cable  that has an anchor cable stop positioned and taped at FS 737.  Do not connect the lifeline to   68  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 an  anchor  cable  that  has  static  lines  attached  to  it  for  an  airdrop.    Connect  the  lifeline when at or anticipating moving aft of FS 677. 6.31.8.2.  Flight  examiner  loadmasters  are  exempt  from  this  requirement  provided  they are  not  performing  primary  or  backup  loadmaster  duties  and  they  will  not  position themselves aft of FS 677 6.31.9.  Survival  Kits/Vests.    All  HC-130  aircraft  will  be  configured  with  one  survival  kit (ML-4)  for  each  crewmember  unless  exempted  or  otherwise  directed  by  MAJCOM.  Reference AFI 11-301 as supplemented.  Survival vests may be used in lieu of survival kits if the mission will not be conducted beyond gliding distance of land. 6.31.10.  Protective Headgear. 6.31.10.1.  All  crewmembers  will  preflight  and  wear  their  helmets  during  contingency and combat missions at the discretion of deployed commander. 6.31.10.2.  All personnel in the cargo compartment will wear protective headgear anytime a static line is attached to an anchor cable with the following exceptions: 6.31.10.2.1.  SATB drops. 6.31.10.2.2.  When the short anchor cable is used, only personnel aft of FS 617 must wear helmets.  WARNING: Personnel will not position themselves directly under the center  anchor  cable  supports  (A-frames,  FS  737)  during  personnel  or  equipment airdrops  requiring  the  use  of  the  anchor  cable.

Hazardous Medical Equipment. 6.35.1.  Nonstandard equipment possessed by medical facilities that use ACC air evacuation services should be regarded as potentially hazardous.  Two types of equipment are of major concern: 6.35.1.1.  Electronic  medical  equipment  produces  electromagnetic  interference  (EMI) which  is  commonly  beyond  the  limits  specified  by  MIL  STD  461A  and  462,  and therefore can interfere with aircraft communication and navigational equipment. 6.35.1.2.  Therapeutic  oxygen  systems  present  an  increased  hazard  of  fire  or  explosion.  A  potential  hazard  is  the  inadvertent  disruption  of  the  cylinder  neck,  manifold,  or regulator resulting in explosion and propulsion of the container or accessories. 6.35.2.  For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions: 6.35.2.1.  Pararescue  or  medical  personnel  must  inform  the  PIC  when  nonstandard electronic medical equipment is brought on board the aircraft. 6.35.2.2.  The  PIC  must  be  informed  of  the  anticipated  period  of  use  of  the  equipment during the mission. 6.35.2.3.  The  PIC  must  be  alert  for  any  interference  with  aircraft  communications  or navigation equipment during periods of use of this equipment. 6.35.2.4.  When  continuous  use  of  the  equipment  is  required  throughout  the  duration  of the  mission,  flight  must  be  restricted  to  VFR  conditions.    Furthermore,  exercise AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   73  additional  caution  on  night  VFR  missions  to  ensure  there  are  no  adverse  effects  on navigational equipment. 6.35.3.  For nonstandard oxygen equipment, take the following precautions: 6.35.3.1.  All  compressed  oxygen  equipment  with  exposed,  unprotected  cylinder  neck, manifold, or regulator must be completely secured from all movement in its longitudinal and lateral axes. 6.35.3.2.  Pararescue or medical personnel must continually monitor the operation of the equipment to detect possible malfunction during exposure to altitude. Section 6D—Departure 6.36.  Departure Briefing.

(T-1)  The  navigator  and  PM  will  back  up  the  pilot  and  report any deviations from the planned departure. 6.38.  NVG Departures. 6.38.1.  NVG  Departure  Weather  Minimums.    Pilots  may  use  NVGs  to  assist  in  instrument takeoffs  as  mission  requirements  dictate.    Current  mission-qualified  pilots  may  fly  NVG departures IAW AFI 11-202V3 departure weather minimums. Crews must consider weather conditions, moon illumination and position, sky glow at dawn and dusk, cultural lighting, and weapon/expendable effects when planning NVG operations. 6.38.2.  NVG Malfunctions during Takeoff.   During an NVG takeoff, if the PF experiences NVG  failure,  the  takeoff  may  be  continued  at  the  discretion  of  the  PIC.  The  PM  must  be ready to immediately assume aircraft control if the PF experiences spatial disorientation or an NVG malfunction.  See AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 for additional NVG emergency information. Section 6E—En Route 6.39.  Checklists.  (T-1)  Accomplish  all  checklists  with  strict  discipline.    A  checklist  is  not complete until all items are accomplished. 6.39.1.  The pilot flying the aircraft will initiate all checklists unless the flight manual or this instruction dictates otherwise. 6.39.2.  Carry abbreviated checklists in the USAF Flight Crew Checklist  binders.  The only pages  (or  inserts)  authorized  in  checklist  binders  are  C-130  series  T.O.  aircrew  checklists, MAJCOM  approved  checklists  (includes  changes/updates),  briefing  guides,  and  approved information guides.  Units may construct locally approved in-flight guides. 6.39.3.  Crew  members  may  make  personal  notes  in  pencil  on  checklists,  briefings,  or information guides, if desired.  Such notes must be current. 6.39.4.

Classified  interphone  or  radio  transmissions  will  be  recorded  on  the  cockpit voice recorder (CVR) if it is operating.  Ensure the CVR remains on and running for 30 minutes  until  the  tape  is  clear  of  any  recorded  classified  conversations.    If  classified information  is  discussed  while  the  FLIR  voice  recorder  is  used  in  flight,  the  VHS  tape must  be  turned  into  Intel  to  be  classified  upon  landing.    If  en  route,  have  the  classified courier maintain the VHS tape until the tape has been properly classified. 6.47.1.3.  Non-aircrew  members  may  monitor  interphone  or  radio  transmissions  only when specifically approved by the PIC.  The PIC will ensure the communications policy is  briefed  to  these  personnel  prior  to  flight.    The  PIC  must  ensure  no  one  monitors classified information for which they  are not  cleared or transmits  classified information over the radios. 6.47.2.  Command  Radios.    Make  all  communications  IAW  FLIP  or  as  directed  by  the controlling agency. 6.47.2.1.  The  pilot  operating  the  command  radios  will  inform  the  crew  which  radio  is primary. 6.47.2.2.  The PM normally makes all primary radio calls. 6.47.2.3.  All crewmembers will monitor the primary radio unless specifically directed to do otherwise by the PIC or subsequent chapters of this instruction.  If the crew does not have an AMSS, the PIC will designate crewmembers required to monitor the HF and/or SATCOM radio. 6.47.2.4.  During  emergencies,  monitor  simultaneous  UHF  and  VHF  transmissions,  if able, when operating in a terminal area under radar control.   76  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 6.47.2.5.  One of the pilots will record and read back all ATC clearances.  The navigator or  AMSS  will  record  the  clearance  and  monitor  the  read  back.    This  includes  all transmissions pertaining to ATC instructions involving departure, en route, and approach procedures.    This  may  be  disregarded  when  ATC  instructions  require  immediate execution,  or  when  such  action  interferes  with  timely  completion  of  more  important duties. 6.48.  In-flight Emergency (IFE) Procedures.  Report deviations from directives that occur as a result of an emergency, in accordance with AFI 11-202V3 and this instruction. 6.48.1.

As  soon  as  practical  after  completing  the aircraft emergency action checklist, furnish the controlling agency and appropriate Command and  Control  Center  (CCC)  a  description  and  extent  of  the  difficulty,  assistance  required, intentions, and any further pertinent information. 6.48.2.  The  PIC  may  initiate  a  CONFERENCE  HOTEL  when  additional  expertise  is necessary  to  cope  with  emergencies  or  other  conditions.    It  convenes  at  the  lowest  level where  expertise  is  available,  and  will  not  be  elevated  for  the  purpose  of  keeping  the  next higher  echelon  informed.  Table  6.6  lists  CONFERENCE  HOTEL  contact  information extracted from AFI 11-418, Operations Supervision.  See AFI 11-418, for further details. Table 6.6.  Conference HOTEL Contact Information. TIME 24 HOURS: PROCEDURE Call Lockheed Martin Technical Representative: CONTACT DSN: 625-9001, or  Comm: (770) 494-1705 NON-DUTY HOURS:   Call Robins Command Post and ask for home phone numbers for above personnel. Robins Command Post will maintain a current listing of home telephone numbers for POCs. DSN  497-2612/13/14/15.    Commercial:  (478) 327-2612/13/14/15 POCs: Steve Horbath  Mark Neas  Wayne Roberts  6.48.3.  When  in  UHF  or  VHF  range,  initiate  the  conference  over  appropriate  discrete frequencies.  When out of VHF or UHF range, use HF radios to establish a phone patch with the  nearest  or  controlling  CCC.    Provide  a  narrative  description  of  the  situation  including actions taken, intentions, and type of expertise desired. 6.48.4.  Turnaround  Procedures.  When  a  turnaround  is  necessary,  use  procedures  in  FLIP.  Maintain VFR, reverse course, climb or descend to a VFR altitude or flight level and request ATC  clearance.    If  unable  to  maintain  VFR,  obtain  an  ATC  clearance  before  reversing course.  A turnaround under IFR conditions, without ATC approval, will be made only after a thorough evaluation of the seriousness of the emergency, general traffic density, and known traffic operating in the immediate area.  Normally, a climb or descent (with minimum change in altitude) to a VFR altitude or flight level will result in minimum exposure to other aircraft, if a turnaround is required. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   77  6.48.5.  Continued Flight with Engine Loss. (T-1)  A flight may proceed on three engines to its destination if two-engine capability exists, favorable operating conditions prevail both en route and at the point of intended landing, and a suitable alternate airfield is available at all times.  The flight engineer will inform pilot of charted two-engine range.  If these conditions cannot be met, the flight will terminate at the nearest facility (preferably military) which, in the judgment of the PIC, offers safe and favorable operating conditions. 6.49.  Need for Medical Assistance.  When a person on board the aircraft requires medical care, the PIC will inform the station of next intended landing in sufficient time so medical personnel may meet  the aircraft.   The request  will include the individual’s sex, approximate age, and the nature of the medical problem. 6.50.  Weather  Forecasts.  For  authorized  weather  sources,  refer  to  AFH  11-203V2,  Weather for  Aircrews,  the  Flight  Information  Handbook  (FIH)  or  use  a  published  MAJCOM-approved source.  See the FIH for additional information and OWS geographic areas of responsibility. 6.50.1.  For  all  flights  outside  the  local  area,  the  AMSS  will  obtain  the  destination  and alternate  (if  applicable)  forecasts,  to  include  pressure  altitude  and  temperature,  before reaching the equal time point and one hour prior to ETA. 6.50.2.  Obtain latest weather prior to descent for landing at destination. Section 6F—Arrival 6.51.  Descent.  (T-1)  Crews should plan and initiate their descent in order to comply with ATC arrival and instrument approach procedures. Primary crewmembers will not be involved in duties other  than  aircraft  operations,  descent  and  approach  monitoring,  and  required  checklist  items from  the initial  descent  point to  landing. The PM and navigator will monitor the approach and report any deviations from prescribed procedures. 6.51.1.  Before  descent  into  unfamiliar  areas,  pilots  and  navigators  will  review  appropriate terrain charts to increase aircrew situational awareness of obstructions. 6.51.2.  Night  and  Marginal  Weather  Operations.  Fly  a  precision  approach,  if  available,  at night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available approved  instrument  approach.  Visual  approaches  may  be  flown  during  night  VFR conditions,  if  an  approved  instrument  approach  is  not  available  or  operational/training mission requirements dictate. 6.52.  Cold Weather Altimeter Setting  Procedures.  Apply cold weather altimeter corrections for  non-tactical  situations  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-202V3.    For  tactical  operations,  see Chapter 15. 6.53.  Radar  Altimeter  Procedures.  (T-1) Pilots  and  navigators  will  crosscheck  radar altimeters during descent to ensure adequate terrain clearance is provided throughout the descent and maneuvering portion of the approach.  Once established in a VFR traffic pattern, the radar altimeter may be set at the discretion of the pilot. 6.54.  Instrument Approach Procedures.  Comply with AFI 11-202V3 and the following:   78  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 6.54.1.  The  C-130  is  a  category  "C"  aircraft.  If  approach  speeds  exceed  140  knots,  the minimums  for  Category  "D"  will  be  used.  DH/MDA,  instrument  approach  visibility  and,  if required, ceiling minimums will be as published, with the following exceptions: 6.54.2.  If full flight instrumentation is not operational, base DH on a minimum HAT of 300 feet and RVR 4000, or visibility three-fourths mile if RVR is not available. 6.54.3.  Full flight instrumentation for an ILS includes: 6.54.3.1.  Dual  flight  displays  [one  flight  director  plus  ADI  repeat  satisfies  this requirement]. 6.54.3.2.  Complete  differential  pressure systems, and attitude indicators in the pilot and copilot positions. instruments,  compass/heading reference 6.54.4.  Full  flight  instrumentation  for  a  PAR  will  include:  complete  differential  pressure instruments, compass systems/heading reference systems, and attitude indicators in both pilot positions. 6.54.5.  Aircrews performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0 degrees centigrade or below will refer AFI 11-202V3 and the Flight Information Handbook, section D, Temperature Correction Chart. 6.55.  Precision Approach.  Visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400 or one-half mile if RVR is not available.  DH will be based on a HAT of no less than 200 feet. 6.56.  Circling Approach.  Minimum descent altitude (MDA) will be as published for category aircraft.  If  the  minimums  are  not  published  by  category,  the  minimum  altitude  will  be  as published,  but  in  no  case  lower  than  the  value  indicated  below,  plus  the  published  airport elevation: 6.56.1.  Category C.  500 feet - 1 1/2 SM 6.56.2.  Category D.  600 feet - 2 SM 6.57.  Coupled  Approach  Procedures.  When  a  coupled  approach  is  flown,  assume  manual control at or above published minimum altitude (MDA/DH). 6.58.  NVG Approach and Landing. 6.58.1.  NVG  Approach  Weather  Minimums.  Current  mission  qualified  pilots  may  fly  IFR approaches with weather at approach minimums. 6.58.2.  NVG  Malfunction  during  Approach  and  Landing.  If  one  of  the  pilots  experience NVG failure on short final, it will be at the discretion of the PIC to transition to normal lights or perform a go-around. The PM must be ready to immediately assume aircraft control if the PF experiences spatial disorientation or an NVG malfunction. Section 6G—Post Flight 6.59.  Maintenance  Documentation  (T-1).  Complete  the  AFTO  Form  781  after  each  flight.  After  landing,  crewmembers  debrief  maintenance  personnel  on  the  condition  of  the  aircraft, engines, avionics equipment, and all installed special equipment as required. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   79  6.59.1.  The PIC will review the aircraft forms, determine those discrepancies considered as mission essential, and indicate them by entering “ME” in block letters in the lower left hand corner  of  the  AFTO  Form  781A,  Maintenance  Discrepancy  and  Work  Document discrepancy  block.    Use  “MC”  (mission  contributing)  to  indicate  any  discrepancies  that,  if not  corrected,  would  substantially  affect  mission  accomplishment,  but  are  not  mission essential. At stations where there is no maintenance, and maintenance support is required, the PIC will ensure a thorough debrief is provided to the controlling CCC prior to entering crew rest. 6.59.2.  Ensure flight time, landings, aircraft condition, and fuel onloaded/off-loaded during refueling operations is entered in the AFTO Form 781H. 6.60.  Salt  Spray  and  Clear  Water  Rinse.  (T-3).    The  accumulation  of  salt  spray  on windshields and side windows is a hazard that must be considered for low-level overwater flight.  Weigh  this  against  mission  urgency  prior  to  descent  below  500  feet,  when  heavy  seas  or  high surface winds exist.  In some cases, it will be preferable to fly at a higher altitude to avoid this condition. An entry will be placed in the AFTO Form 781A, "Aircraft Subjected to Salt Spray" (state lowest altitude and duration) anytime the aircraft is flown under 1000 feet above sea level except  for  takeoffs  and  landings  Clear  water  rinse  facility  (birdbath)  usage  guidelines  are  as follows: 6.60.1.  Crews should use a clear water rinse facility (birdbath) after every flight in which the aircraft  is  flown  over  salt  water  below  1000’  AGL,  including  tactical  approaches  and landings.    Multiple  instrument  approaches  do  not  require  a  clear  water  rinse,  unless,  in  the judgment  of  the  crew,  the  aircraft  was  subjected  to  salt  spray.    If  a  birdbath  facility  is unavailable  make  the  following  annotation  in  the  AFTO  form  781A,  “aircraft  subjected  to salt  spray,  birdbath  unavailable”  The  following  guidance  will  be  used  to  maximize  the effectiveness of the birdbath and to ensure safe operations. 6.60.2.  Crews  will  ensure  that  sensors  such  as  the  radar/IDS  are  off  prior  to  entering  the birdbath. 6.60.3.  The  GTC,  ATM,  ATM  generator,  and  APU  will  remain  off  with  doors  closed  to prevent flameout and flooding of the GTC/APU compartment. 6.60.4.  Set flaps to 100% and switch off and extend both auxiliary and normal landing lights (if applicable). 6.60.5.  All  four  engines  should  be  at  normal  ground  idle  with  the  lowest  power  setting available.    Two  engines  in  normal  ground  idle,  and  two  in  LSGI  may  be  used  if  aircraft weight does not restrict the forward movement through the bath. 6.60.6.  As full water spray begins, start taxiing slowly on centerline at a rate which allows adequate  rinsing  of  the  entire  aircraft.    Hold  nose  wheel  steering  centered  and  start windshield  wipers.    Exercise  flight  controls  while  in  the  birdbath.    Complete  the  AFTER LANDING  Checklist  after  rinse  is  completed,  run  engines  at  normal  ground  idle  for  a minimum of two minutes to aid in drying out engine nacelles. 6.60.7.  Review  local  procedures  for  birdbath  operating  guidelines.  Each  birdbath  is  unique in  design  and  function  and  local  procedures  such  as  direction  of  entry,  wing  tip  clearance criteria, noise abatement concerns, etc. need to be reviewed prior to its use.  CAUTION:   It   80  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 is possible to experience an overheat indication during or immediately following the birdbath due to water intrusion into the overheat warning systems.  Each crew will have to analyze the indication and make a judgment as to the emergency action to be taken. 6.60.8.  For  units  flying  aircraft  equipped  with  LAIRCM  Small  Laser  Turret  Assemblies (SLTA) do not utilize the bird bath with the Group B (turrets) installed due to water intrusion problems with the SLTA, MC/HC-130s.  This does not preclude using the birdbath when the aircraft is configured with Group A (turrets removed and plates installed) only. Section 6H—Miscellaneous Procedures 6.61.  Impoundment of Aircraft.  (T-1)  If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the  PIC  shall  impound the  aircraft  immediately  after  landing  IAW  AFI  21-101  and  contact  the controlling  C2  agency  for  further  instructions.  If  at  an  Air  Force  installation,  the  PIC  shall request impound from the appropriate maintenance authority. 6.62.  Support  Agencies.  (T-1)  The  PIC  or  a  designated  representative  will  pass  significant information to support agencies, such as weather, ATC, or base operations.  The actual weather encountered should be  compared to  forecast  weather, and this information provided to  weather personnel to facilitate improved support.  Debrief intelligence, when applicable. 6.63.  Crew  Debriefing.  (T-1)  The  PIC  will  conduct  a  debriefing  after  each  mission.    The debriefing will include all applicable crewmembers so that common problems can be discussed and resolved.  Crewmembers may be excused from debrief at the discretion of the PIC. 6.64.  Aircrew  Notification  Procedures.  (T-1)  When  transiting  installations,  the  PIC  will establish  a  point  of  contact  with  the  CCC,  base  operations,  or  local  airport  manager  when  the crew is billeted in off-base quarters.  The PIC will be notified immediately in case of incident or emergency affecting the safety or security of the aircraft. 6.65.  Dropped  Objects.  (T-1)  During  aircraft  exterior  visual  inspections,  pay  particular attention to surfaces, panels, and components, which could potentially be dropped objects.  If a dropped object is discovered and the mission is continued, the flight crew will: 6.65.1.  Ensure a write-up is entered in the AFTO Form 781A. 6.65.2.  Notify  the  Command  Center  as  soon  as  practical.    Include  route  of  flight,  altitude, and weather conditions (i.e., turbulence, etc.). 6.66.  Border Clearance.  The border clearance responsibility will be as designated by the base or area command specified in DOD directive 4500.09E,Transportation and Traffic Management, DOD 4500.54E, Foreign Clearance Program as well as implementing guidance to the FCP set out at https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/  in  addition  to  other  United  States  Entry  Requirements  and Related Areas. the  Foreign  Clearance  Manual in and the  Foreign  Clearance  Guide 6.66.1.  Normal Operations. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border  clearance  of  its  aircraft.  When  support  is  not  available,  border  clearance  is  the responsibility of the PIC. Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or to the loadmaster, but the PIC retains ultimate responsibility. When an aircraft is on-loaded at a base without an air traffic function, the PIC is responsible for ensuring the following: AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   81  6.66.1.1.  Crewmembers  and  passengers  possess  current  passports  and  valid  visas,  if required. 6.66.1.2.  Crewmembers  and  passengers  have  current  shot  records  or  certificates  of immunization. 6.66.1.3.  Cargo entry documents are in proper order. 6.66.1.4.  Departure or arrival to the US is through a port of entry where border clearance can be obtained. 6.66.1.5.  Border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and baggage, if required, is obtained before takeoff to a foreign area, or after arrival from a foreign area. 6.66.1.6.  If required, accomplish Aircraft spraying IAW paragraph 6.70 6.66.1.7.  En  route  to  the  US,  the  loadmaster  has  distributed  personal  customs declarations to  all  passengers  and  crewmembers;  has  briefed  passengers  and crewmembers  on  customs  regulations;  and  has  prepared  and  compiled  necessary  border clearance forms for the PIC’s signature. 6.66.1.8.  All  aircraft  and  passenger  garbage  will  be  collected  and  placed  in  tight  leak-proof, covered container(s.)  A doubled lined trash bag at least  3 mil  (0.003 inch) thick with  an  airtight  knot  will  suffice.    All  plant  and  agricultural  bi-products  are  considered prohibited  (e.g.  fruits,  vegetables)  unless  packaged,  authorized,  and  cleared  for importation into the US.  All  garbage will be turned over for disposal  to  the authorized agent. 6.66.1.9.  En  route  to  the  US,  the  base  of  intended  landing  is  notified  of  any  change  in ETA, to ensure border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing. 6.66.1.10.  A Permit to Proceed is obtained when the mission requires an aircraft, which has  landed  in  the  US  for  customs  clearance,  to  proceed  to  another  US  base  to  obtain border clearance.  The permit delays customs inspection of cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the offload station, saving intermediate offloading and reloading normally required for customs inspection.  The Permit to proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing,  where  the  border  clearance  must  be  completed,  or  a  new  permit  obtained.    Do not make intermediate stops unless required by an emergency situation, or directed by C2 authority. 6.66.1.11.  When  an  aircraft  lands  for  a  US  border  clearance,  a  US  Customs representative  normally  meets  the  aircraft  to  obtain  the  required  documents.    Do  not deplane  passengers  or  crewmembers,  except  a  scanner  to  install  chocks  and  gear  pins, unless  necessary  for  safety.    Do  not  unload  until  approved  by  customs  and  agriculture personnel  or  their  designated  representatives.    This  procedure  applies  to  the  initial landing in the US and all subsequent landings until crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance. 6.66.2.  Exercise and Contingency Operations. 6.66.2.1.  General.   Certain  missions, which do not  transit normal  ports of entry or exit, require  special  procedures  to  expedite  compliance  with  customs,  public  health,   82  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 immigration,  and  agricultural  requirements.    A  joint  memorandum  of  understanding establishes procedures and waivers. 6.66.2.2.  Implementation.  Traffic and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the  agreement  as  necessary  for  each  operation.    Inspection  and  clearance  may  be accomplished at the CONUS onload or offload base instead of the normal port of entry, or at the foreign onload or offload base. 6.67.  Customs  Procedures.  See  DOD  4500.9-R,  Defense  Transportation  Regulation,  Part  V, Customs and other United States Entry Requirements and Related Areas. 6.67.1.  Outbound.  No (Outward/Inward) Agriculture, Customs, Immigration and Public Health, is waived. requirements.  CBP  Form  7507,  General  Declaration 6.67.2.  Inbound.  Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival. 6.67.2.1.  CBP Form 7507 (passenger list not required). 6.67.2.2.  Cargo manifest. 6.67.2.3.  For troops out of country less than 140 days. 6.67.2.3.1.  Troop commander’s certificate from examination of troop baggage. 6.67.2.3.2.  One  copy  of  CBP  Form  6059B,  Customs  Declaration,  for  each passenger not under command of the troop commander, to include observers, support personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers. 6.67.2.3.3.  Upon  arrival  at  a  CONUS  offload  base,  a  Customs  representative  meets the  aircraft  and  accepts  the  troop  commander's  certificate  with  respect  to  troop baggage.    Individual  baggage  declarations  are  not  required.    The  troop  commander should  have  inspected  troop  baggage.    Troops  debark  under  the  observation  of  the Customs representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The Customs officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection. 6.67.3.  For troops out of the country 140 days or more. 6.67.3.1.  One copy of DD Form 1854, Customs Accompanied Baggage,  or CBP Form 6059B  for  each  passenger.    This  includes  observers,  support  personnel,  civilians,  news media personnel, and crewmembers. 6.67.3.2.  Upon  arrival  at  a  CONUS  offload  base,  a  Customs  representative  meets  the aircraft and collects all declarations.  Troops debark under the observation of the Customs representative, who may make discretionary examination of the baggage. 6.67.4.  Immigration Procedures. 6.67.4.1.  Outbound.  No requirements. 6.67.4.2.  Inbound.  Submit one copy of CBP 7507 to the Immigration inspector. 6.68.  Customs, Immigration, and Agricultural Inspections. 6.68.1.  Obtain  Customs,  Agriculture,  and  Public  Health  clearance,  as  required,  prior  to opening any doors, hatches, or windows, other than the crew entrance door, or enplaning and deplaning personnel. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   83  6.68.2.  Proceed  directly  from  the  aircraft  to  Customs,  Immigration,  or  Agricultural inspection for processing when required by the inspector. 6.68.3.  US  military  aircraft  are  sovereign  territory.  When  cleared  to  over  fly  or  land  in foreign  territory,  it  is  US  policy  to  assert  that  military  aircraft  are  entitled  to  the  privileges and  immunities  which  customarily  are  accorded  to  warships.    Privileges  and  immunities include,  in  the  absence  of  stipulations  to  the  contrary,  exemption  from  duties  and  taxation; immunity  from  search,  seizure,  and  inspections  (including  customs  and  safety  inspections); or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or cargo on board.  The PIC will not authorize search, seizure, inspection, or similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction of HQ USAF or the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the country concerned.  (T-0). 6.68.4.  (T-0)  The  PIC  will  not  permit  the  inspection  of  their  aircraft  by  officials  of  any foreign government.  The PIC and crew will deny access and seek aid from the senior ACC (or other USAF) representative, US Embassy, or Consulate within the host nation.  Customs or other officials will be informed of the above policy and requested to confirm their request through  their  own  government  and  with  US  Department  of  State  representatives.    If necessary,  the  crew  will  seal  the  aircraft,  the  crew  entered  into  crew  rest,  and  departure intentions will be canceled until resolution of the matter by the appropriate authority.  Inform C2 authorities by the fastest available means should this situation occur. 6.68.5.  When  confronted  with  a  search  request  by  foreign  authorities,  aircrews  should consider the following procedures: 6.68.5.1.  In  most  cases,  search  attempts  may  be  stopped  by  a  statement  to  the  foreign officials  that  the  aircraft  is  sovereign  and  not  subject  to  search  without  consent  of  HQ USAF or the chief of mission in the country concerned.  This should be clearly conveyed in  a  polite  manner  so  as  not  to  offend  foreign  authorities  that  may  honestly,  but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft. 6.68.5.2.  If  foreign  authorities  insist  on  conducting  a  search,  PICs  must  negotiate  to delay  the  search  until  contact  is  made  with  HQ  USAF  or  U.S.  Embassy  or  Consulate within the host nation. The PIC should unequivocally state that they have no authority to consent to the search and that they must relay the host nation request to these agencies for decision.    The  PIC  should  then  notify  these  agencies  of  the  request  by  the  most expeditious means available.  Thereafter, the PIC should follow instructions provided by the U.S. Embassy or Consulate within the host nation and HQ USAF. 6.68.5.3.  If  foreign  officials  refuse  to  desist  in  their  search  request,  the  PIC  should indicate that they would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel and mechanical considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do so. 6.68.5.4.  If permission  is  refused and the  foreign authorities insist  on forcing their way on  board  an  aircraft,  the  PIC  should  state  that  they  protest  the  course  of  action  being pursued and that they intend to notify both the U.S. Embassy or Consulate and HQ USAF of the foreign action.  The PIC should then allow the foreign agents onboard the aircraft, without  physical  resistance,  and  thereafter  report  the  incident  to  HQ  USAF  and appropriate embassy, as soon as possible.   84  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 6.68.5.5.  In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive cargo or equipment.  These instructions and applicable provisions of classified supplements to the FCG should be followed, where applicable. 6.69.  Military Customs Preclearance Inspection Program. 6.69.1.  The  military  customs  program  was  developed  to  assist  the  DOD  and  other  US Government  agencies  in  the  control  of  narcotics,  contraband,  and  prohibited  agricultural products, and to expedite entry of DOD personnel and material into the customs territory of the United States.  See  DOD 4500.9-R. 6.69.2.  Military  Customs  Inspectors  will  accomplish  this  inspection  immediately  prior  to departure  and  may  conduct  more  than  one  preclearance  inspection  on  CONUS-bound aircraft.    When  security  considerations  necessitate  deviation  from  this  policy,  mission planners  must  coordinate  with  the  appropriate  agency  to  ensure  the  mission  is  not jeopardized. 6.70.  Insect and Pest Control (Aircraft Spraying).  (T-0).  PICs will ensure required spraying is  accomplished  in  accordance  with  AFI  32-1053,  paragraph  3.5.3.6.3.,  Integrated  Pest Management  Program  (23  Jun  2009).  Also,  consult  the  DOD  Electronic  Foreign  Clearance Guide  (https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/fcg.cfm)  referenced  in  AFI  16-606,  Foreign  Clearance Program  (21  January  2011),  paragraph  2.1.1.,  for  country  specific  quarantine  clearance requirements.  Consult  Armed  Forces  Pest  Management  Board  TG  No.  31  (February  28,  2012) for  specific  guidance  on  aircraft  public  health  preparation  for  deployment  and  redeployment. Spraying will also be IAW AFJI 48-104, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces, January 24, 1992, DOD 4500.54E (December 28,2009). Certify the spraying on Customs Form 7507, or on forms provided by the country transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on board. The only exception is when mandated by DOD 4500.54E. 6.70.1.  When  spraying  is  required,  use  insecticide,  aerosol  d-phenothrin-2  percent,  NSN 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft. Wear leather or Nomex gloves while spraying. 6.70.1.1.  Direct  the  nozzle  toward  the  ceiling  of  the  compartment  or  space  being sprayed. 6.70.1.2.  Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments, wheel wells, and other similar spaces. 6.70.1.3.  Spray  the  cabin,  cockpit,  and  other  spaces  accessible  from  within  the  aircraft after  the  crew  is  aboard  and  after  closing  all  doors,  windows,  hatches,  and  ventilation openings.  CAUTION:  If  the  insecticide  label  directs  disembarkation  after  use,  spray before  boarding  crew  or  passengers.  Close  all  doors  and  hatches  for  10  minutes  after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on board. 6.70.1.4.  Spray for 105 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being transited.  NOTE:  Keep  used  aerosol  cans  separate  from  other  trash  so  they  may  be disposed of safely. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   85  6.70.2.  Responsibility of PIC  In-flight. When seeing any insect  or rodent  infestation of the aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, airfield management operations, or airport manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft. 6.70.3.  Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival, do not open cargo doors  or  hatches  except  to  enplane  officials  required  to  inspect  the  aircraft  for  insect  or rodent  infestation.    Do  not  onload  or  offload  cargo  or  passengers  until  the  inspection  is satisfactorily  completed.  This  procedure  may  be  altered  to  satisfy  mission  or  local requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.   86  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 Chapter 7 AIRCRAFT SECURITY 7.1.  General.  This  chapter provides guidance on aircraft security, in-flight and on the ground.  Aircrews must make every reasonable effort to resist an aircraft hijacking.  Resistance may vary from  dissuasion  to  direct  physical  confrontation,  including  the  use  of  weapons.    Due  to  the sensitive  nature  of  anti-hijacking  procedures,  crewmembers  should  reference  AFI  13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (FOUO) and the FIH for specific guidance.  Aircrews will not release any information concerning those procedures or hijacking attempts. 7.2.  Security.  HC-130  aircraft  are  Protection  Level  3  resources.    This  security  priority designation applies to operational aircraft, wherever they are located, worldwide.  Some aircraft contain  equipment  and  documents  that  require  protection  per  DOD  5200.1-R,  Information Security Program and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. 7.3.  Procedures.  (T-1)  The  planning  agency  must  ensure  that  adequate  en  route  force protection is available.  The amount of force protection required will vary, depending on location and  ground  time.    PICs  will  receive  a  threat  assessment  and  force  protection  capability evaluation  briefing at  home station prior to  departure and receive updates en route, if required.  During both scheduled and unscheduled landings at non-USAF installations, The PIC will assess the  force  protection  situation  and  take  the  following  actions,  if  force  protection  capability appears insufficient: 7.3.1.  Area Patrol.  Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include back-up  response  forces.    If  local  authorities  request  payment  for  this  service,  use  AF  Form  15, United States Air Force Invoice. 7.3.2.  Aircrew Surveillance.  The PIC will direct armed personnel to remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance over aircraft entrances and activities in the vicinity of the aircraft.  Obtain  a  means  to  report  suspicious  or  hostile  activity  to  security  forces  (e.g.,  land  mobile radio, etc.). 7.3.3.  Locations  with  Unacceptable  Security.    If  local  security  forces  are  unacceptable  or unavailable  and  the  crew  is  not  augmented  with  security  forces,  the  PIC  may  waive  FDP restrictions and depart as soon as possible for a destination with adequate force protection.  If unable  to  depart  the  location  due  to  system  malfunction,  coordinate  through  home  station channels to acquire force protection support. 7.3.4.  Unauthorized  Entry.    If,  in  the  PIC’s  judgment,  the  aircraft  needs  to  be  locked  and sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry: 7.3.4.1.  Use the aircraft  lock.   NOTE: The  aircraft will be locked during  all off-station missions remaining overnight. 7.3.4.1.1.  If the aircraft lock is unavailable, secure the hatches and doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry.  For example, tape inside hatch release handles to  the  airframe,  so  that  entry  pulls  the  tape  loose.    Close  and  seal  the  main  crew entrance door using a boxcar seal or other controllable device to identify forced entry.  Wipe the immediate area around the seal clean to help investigate forced entry.  If the AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   87  seals  are  damaged  or  have  been  tampered  with,  notify  the  appropriate  local authorities, the controlling agency, and inspect the aircraft thoroughly. 7.3.4.2.  Coordinate  with  the  local  base  operations  representative  on  procedures  for servicing the aircraft while the crew is away.  If a padlock is used, the key or combination will  be  left  with  base  operations  or  the  representative  for  servicing  and  maintenance personnel. 7.4.  Protective  Standards  for  Aircraft  Carrying  Distinguished  Visitors.  This  paragraph applies  specifically  to  aircraft  transporting  DVs  Code  4  or  above.    The  PIC    is  responsible  for aircraft security at en route stops. 7.4.1.  DOD  Installations.    Notify  base  security  forces  of  estimated  arrival  and  departure times.    Request  security  forces  maintain  continuous  security  surveillance  during  the  entire ground time.  If the installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available. 7.4.2.  Non-DOD  Installations.    Contact  the  airport  manager  or  installation  commander  to arrange for force protection.  If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security using AF Form 15. 7.5.  Arming of Crewmembers.  (T-1)  When directed, at least one crewmember each from the flight  deck  and  cargo  compartment  will  carry  weapons.    All  crew  members  will  know  who  is armed. 7.5.1.  Issue.  Before departing home station, authorized crewmembers will obtain weapons, ammunition,  lock,  and  key.    Crewmembers  must  present  a  current  AF  Form  523,  USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, to be issued a weapon.  Crewmembers will be reissued the same  weapon  until  the  mission  terminates  at  home  station.    If  an  armed  crewmember  must leave  the  crew  en  route,  transfer  the  weapon  to  another  authorized  crewmember,  using  AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt. 7.5.2.  Loading  and  Transfer  of  Weapons.    Load  and  unload  weapons  at  approved  clearing barrels if available.  To transfer a loaded weapon to another crewmember, place the weapon on a flat surface.  Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer. 7.5.3.  Wearing of Weapons for anti-hijack purposes.  Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at  all  times  to  protect  the  identity  of  armed  crewmembers.    Do  not  wear  weapons  off  the flight line, except to and from the CCC, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities  such  as  base  operations,  fleet  service,  cargo  or  passenger  terminals,  flight  line cafeterias, snack bars, etc. 7.5.4.  Due  to  the  dynamic  nature  of  contingency  and  combat  operations,  unit  commanders may designate all aircrew as arming group A for the purpose of aircraft/resource protection for the following weapons: M-9, M-4/M-16 or equivalent, and M-870, IAW AFI 31-207 and AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program. 7.5.5.  Weapons  Storage  In-flight.    Crewmembers  will  be  armed  before  beginning  preflight or onload duties.  When no passengers are on board and after a satisfactory stowaway check, weapons  may  be  stored  in  the  gun  box  in-flight.    Crewmembers  will  rearm  before  landing.  Weapons need not be unloaded before being placed in the gun box. 7.5.6.  Weapons Storage on the Ground.  Aircrews, including stage crews, will store weapons and  ammunition  in  the  most  secure  facility  available,  normally  the  base  armory.    If  a   88  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 weapons  storage  facility  is  unavailable  or  the  country  prohibits  or  restricts  the  entry  of weapons,  secure  firearms  and  ammunition  in  the  locked  gun  box.    Inform  command  and control agency which crewmember has the gun box key (or combination). 7.5.6.1.  Aircraft  without  a  Gun  Box.    If  an  aircraft  without  a  gun  box  must  remain overnight at a location where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the nearest  acceptable  facility.    Acceptable  storage  facilities  are  US  or  Allied  military services  armories,  US  National  Guard  and  Reserve  armories,  and  US  civil  law enforcement  armories.    If  none  of  these  are  available,  or  the  PIC  believes  weapons security may be compromised, crewmembers may secure their weapons in their quarters, but  one  crewmember  must  remain  with  the  weapons  at  all  times.    In  this  case,  turn  all ammunition over to the PIC. 7.6.  General  Hijacking  Guidance.  The  hijacking  of  an  USAF  aircraft  could  create  a  serious international incident and jeopardize the safety of passengers and property.  An aircraft is most vulnerable  when  the  crew  is  on  board  and  the  aircraft  is  ready  for  flight.    Hijackers  cannot  be dealt with as ordinary criminals.  Some are mentally disturbed, emotionally unstable individuals for whom the threat of death is not a deterrent, but a stimulus to crime.  Delay tactics have been most  successful  in  saving  lives  and  property.    Crews  must  resist  all  attempts  to  hijack  their aircraft.    Resistance  may  vary  from  simple  discouragement  to  direct  physical  attack  with weapons.  Detection of potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is the best solution to the problem. 7.6.1.  Acceptance  of  Passengers.    The  host  station  passenger  processing  and  manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections.  Do not board passengers unless the PIC is fully  satisfied  with  these  inspections.    EXCEPTION:    Supporting/supported  forces  may  be anti-hijack inspected at the aircraft by the aircrew. 7.6.2.  Aeromedical  Procedures.    Military  medical  facility  commanders  are  responsible  for the  anti-hijacking  inspection  of  patients.    When  patients  are  delivered  to  the  aircraft  by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform required inspections before departure. 7.6.3.  Contingency  and  exercise  movements.    During  contingencies  in  support  of  combat operations  involving  the  movement  of  large  numbers  of  personnel  and  exercises,  the supported unit should manifest passengers and perform anti-hijacking inspections. 7.6.4.  Arms  and  Ammunition.    Passengers  will  not  carry  weapons  or  ammunition  on  their person  or  in  hand-carried  baggage  on  board  an  aircraft  except  special  agents  and  guards  of the Secret Service or State Department, and other individuals specifically authorized to carry weapons. 7.6.4.1.  Take  every  precaution  to  prevent  accidental  discharge  of  weapons.    If individuals must clear their weapons, ask them to: 7.6.4.1.1.  Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or personnel before unholstering or unslinging their weapons. 7.6.4.1.2.  Clear their weapons in accordance with standard safety procedure. 7.6.4.1.3.  Troops and deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an aircraft but will turn it in to the troop commander or the PIC.  Troops may carry unloaded  weapons  and  ammunition  on  board  the  aircraft  during  combat  operations.  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   89  When  the  situation  dictates,  weapons  may  be  loaded  at  the  order  of  the  troop commander or team leader. 7.6.4.2.  Carrying Concealed Firearms. The  Air  Force prohibits  all military and  contract employees from carrying concealed firearms on duty except when specifically authorized in writing by a firearms-issuing authority and only while performing an official military duty.  NOTE:  Official  aircrew  orders,  specifying  the  USAF  member  carry  a  concealed firearm, satisfy the written authorization requirement. Military members who violate this provision  prohibiting  the  carrying  of  a  concealed  weapon  without  written  authorization are  subject  to  administrative  or  disciplinary  proceedings  under  Article  92,  Uniformed Code of Military Justice. 7.6.4.2.1.  Except  when  it  might  compromise  your  mission,  always  carry  AF  Form 523 while bearing concealed firearms. In those cases, the issuing authority retains the form.  The  permit  number  on  AF  Form  523  includes  the  heading  "CONCEALED." (These procedures help ensure compatibility between US Air Force authorizations to bear concealed firearms and other jurisdictional requirements.) 7.6.4.2.2.  MAJCOM  authorizes  unit  commanders  to  issue  AF  Forms  523  to personnel  when  missions  require  those  members  to  bear  a  concealed  firearm  on  a regular basis (for example, assigned and gained aircrews armed specifically for anti-hijack purposes). 7.6.4.3.  Hollow Point Ammunition.  The use of  hollow point ammunition is  authorized for  anti-hijacking  purposes  except  in  AORs  subject  to  LOAC  or  ROE  restrictions.    In such instances, use ball type ammunition and remove and store hollow point ammunition until required for anti-hijacking purposes. 7.7.  Specific Anti-Hijacking Guidance.  It is imperative that all crewmembers are familiar with the  ground  and  in-flight  resistance  actions  and  forced  penetration  of  unfriendly  airspace procedures  in  AFI  13-207,  the  FIH  and  current  FAA  guidance.    In  the  event  of  a  hijacking, crewmembers  must  act  immediately  and  resourcefully,  without  instruction,  in  order  to  counter the attacker successfully. 7.8.  Aircraft Force Protection Risk Assessment.  Planners and the PIC may use the matrix in Table 7.1 to help assess the risk to parked aircraft when located at overseas civilian airfields. A cumulative score of less than 55 indicates that normal unmanned aircraft security measures are adequate.  A  score  of  55  to  80  indicates  that  adequate  security  is  provided  by  deployed  US ground  personnel  working  24  hour  operations.  If  the  cumulative  score  is  greater  than  80,  or  if any of the shaded areas in  the figure are applicable, commanders should consider deploying or contracting  security  personnel.  During  unscheduled  or  emergency  landings,  the  PIC  should contact the US Embassy or USDAO for security assistance.   90  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 Table 7.1.

General.  This  chapter  contains  a  description  of  applicable  reports  and  forms.  For assistance in completing safety forms contact the wing/group, unit, or local flight safety officer. 8.2.  AF  IMT  Form  457,  USAF  Hazard  Report.  Refer  to  AFI  91-202,  The  USAF  Mishap Prevention  Program.    The  USAF  hazard  reporting  system  provides  a  means  for  Air  Force personnel  to  alert  supervisors  and  commanders  to  hazardous  conditions  requiring  prompt corrective  action.    A  hazard  is  any  condition,  act,  or  circumstance  that  jeopardizes  or  may jeopardize  the  health  and  well-being  of  personnel,  or  which  may  result  in  loss,  damage,  or destruction of any weapons system, equipment, facility, or material resource. 8.3.  AF IMT Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report.  Refer to AFI 91-202. 8.3.1.  The  Air  Force  HATR  program  provides  a  means  for  personnel  to  report  all  near midair  collisions  and  alleged  hazardous  air  traffic  conditions.    Use  information  in  HATR reports only for mishap prevention.  See AFI 91-202 for a list of reportable incidents. 8.3.2.  Procedures: 8.3.2.1.  Make an airborne report of the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g.  center,  FSS,  control  tower,  or  aeronautical  radio  station),  and  give  the  following information as appropriate: 8.3.2.1.1.  Identification or call sign. 8.3.2.1.2.  Time and place (radial/DME, position relative to the airfield, etc.). 8.3.2.1.3.  Altitude or flight level. 8.3.2.1.4.  Description of the other aircraft or vehicle. 8.3.2.1.5.  Include  a  verbal  statement  as  soon  as  possible  after  occurrence  that  a written HATR report will be filed upon landing.  NOTE: ATC agencies (e.g., FAA, etc) must know if an official report is being filed. 8.3.2.2.  File the HATR as soon as possible (within 24 hours) using any available means of  communication.    Normally,  it  should  be  filed  at  the  base  operations  office  at  the landing  airport.    If  this  is  impractical  and  if  communications  permit,  notify  the  safety office of the Air Force base where the condition occurred, the safety office at the home station, or as prescribed by the overseas MAJCOM.  In any case, provide the safety office with all available information needed to prepare AF IMT Form 651.  Turn in a completed copy  of  AF  Form  651  to  the  wing/group  safety  office.    NOTE:  HATR  reports  are  not privileged information and may be released outside the USAF. 8.3.3.  Individuals  submitting  a  HATR  are  granted  immunity  from  disciplinary  action provided: 8.3.4.  Their violation was not deliberate. 8.3.4.1.  They committed no criminal offense.   92  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 8.3.4.2.  No mishap occurred. 8.3.4.3.  They properly reported the incident using the above procedures. 8.4.

If  an  actual  emergency  arises,  terminate  all  simulated  emergency  flight  procedures training and flight maneuvers practice. 9.16.2.  Practice  emergencies  (which  require  simulating  an  engine  shutdown,  placing switches  in  other  than  their  normal  position,  or  an  abnormal  configuration)  only  during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner pilot is in one of  the  pilot  seats.  Instructor  pilot  candidates  who  occupy  a  pilot  seat  and  are  under  the supervision of a flight examiner pilot, not in a pilot seat, may conduct simulated emergency procedures during initial or requalification upgrade evaluations. This applies to all maneuvers defined  in  paragraph  9.22  unless  otherwise  specified  in  the  individual  maneuver restrictions. 9.16.3.  Legacy  trained  copilots  may  conduct  simulated  3-engine  approaches,  missed approaches,  and  landings  with  squadron  commander  approval  and  when  under  the  direct supervision of an IP.  NOTE: Unless otherwise specified in a MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-202V2, place a letter of certification by the SQ/CC in the FEF and make an entry on the AF IMT form 1381/4348.  Documentation of designation as an PIC candidate will be IAW AFI 11-2HC-130V1. 9.16.4.  MPD pilots may conduct 3-engine approaches, missed approaches, landings and no-flap approaches and landings from the left seat under the direct supervision of an IP.

Simulated engine failure is authorized  in  daylight  IMC  if  the  weather  is  at  or  above  circling  minimums  and  at  night  with weather at  or  above 1,000 foot ceiling  and 2 SM visibility or  circling minimums,  whichever is higher. For landings, crosswind component must be within the recommended zone of the landing crosswind chart. Use all 4 engines for a touch-and-go takeoff. 9.17.1.  Normally turns should be planned to be in the direction of the good engines.  Turns into  simulated  failed  engines  should  be  minimized.  Turns  into  simulated  failed  engines  are permissible but require a higher degree of pilot skill than with actual failed engines and must be smooth and coordinated. 9.17.2.  When  conducting  simulated  engine(s)  out  training,  the  flight  engineer  will  post actual  charted  minimum  control  speeds  on  the  TOLD  card.  For  charted  one-engine  out minimum control speed above 109 knots, calculate a new minimum control speed by adding 8  knots  during  simulated  one-engine  out  training.  For  a  charted  2-engine  out  minimum control  speed  that  falls  between  117  and  128,  calculate  a  new  minimum  control  speed  by adding  8  knots  during  simulated  2-engine  out  training.  During  simulated  3-engine  takeoff operations,  takeoff  speed  will  be  adjusted  for  minimum  control  speed.  If  the  charted minimum control speed is above 109 knots, add the 8 knot correction factor. 9.17.3.  Additional Restrictions: 9.17.3.1.  Simulated  engine-out  no-flap  landings  are  restricted  to  PIC  candidates  and above. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   99  9.17.3.2.

Flight  Plans.    Forms  printed  from  either  a  MAJCOM-certified  automated  flight planning  system  or  current  AF  Forms  are  authorized.    Automated  flight  planning  system forms  will  mirror  current  AF  Forms  as  published  on  the  Air  Force  e-Publishing  web  site. Computed  data  will  match  aircraft  type,  configuration,  requirements  and  limitations  for mission to be flown. 11.3.2.  Signature.    Sign  all  fuel  and  flight  plans  that  are  used  for  planned  missions.  The navigator’s signature will signify all data was checked for accuracy.  On the AF IMT Forms 4116, sign in the indicated block on page 2 to certify accuracy of all entries.  Any entries not required for a particular mission on the AF Form 4116 may be left blank. 11.3.3.  Data  transfer.    If  the  flight-planning  computer  transfers  a  flight  plan  to  the  aircraft electronically, it will be a MAJCOM-approved system. 11.3.4.  A MAJCOM-certified flight plan and log (AF Form 70, AF Form 4116, or computer generated  equivalent)  is  required  for  all  flights  except  local  area  training  flights  with  an established standard procedure. 11.3.5.  A  fuel  plan  is  required  for  all  flights  except  local  area  training  flights  with established standard ramp fuel loads. 11.3.6.  Automated  Flight  Planning  System.    The  aircrew  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the accuracy  of  automated  flight  planning  data  generated  for  use.  This  entails  aircrew  paying special  attention  to  entering  arguments  such  as  aircraft  configuration,  fuel  load,  engine performance,  fuel  flow  model  (climb,  cruise,  and  descent),  heading/magnetic  variation calculation,  temperature,  winds,  plus  any  other  variables  which  affect  the  accuracy  of  the calculated flight and fuel plan. 11.3.6.1.  Creating  Flight  Logs.  In  addition  to  manual  flight  logs  (AF  Form  4116), MAJCOM-certified  automated  flight  planning  system  software  is  authorized  to  create  a navigator flight log. 11.3.6.2.  Automated Flight Planning Software.  Uncertified, untested or beta versions of automated flight planning system software will not be used for actual mission planning.

When an alternate destination is required, ensure at least a single separate waypoint be included in the flight plan to include name of the alternate, altitude, time, course, distance, and winds.  If additional IFR enroute waypoints are available, inclusion of these will enhance fuel planning accuracy. 11.5.  Flight  Charts (Oceanic/Category  I  Route  Structure  and  IFR/Category  II Routing).  (T-1)  Hardcopy  charts  will be available for use during high level  flight  operations.  On  Category  II  routes  when  under  ATC  control,  the  use  of  DoD  approved  FLIP  publications meets  this  requirement.    Appropriate  scale  electronic  charts  on  a  portable  moving  map  system may  be  used  as  the  primary  aeronautical  chart  reference;  however,  hardcopy  charts  will  be immediately  available  in  case  of  loss  of  portable  laptop.    NOTE:    Category  I  and  II  Route definitions are found in Attachment 1. 11.5.1.  Chart Scale.  As a minimum, ensure 1:500,000 or larger scale hardcopy charts (i.e., TPC,  LFC,  JOG)  are  available  during  departure/arrival  procedures  (either  IFR  or  VFR).  When  utilizing  either  hardcopy  or  moving  map  display  during  departure/arrival  phases  of flight  (as a minimum) ensure Airports, Airspace Boundaries, SUAS Boundaries, VVOD (if available),  and  ECHUM  are  displayed.    Hardcopy  charts  for  in-flight  use  during oceanic/Category  I  operations  will  be  either  JNC  or  GNC  series.    NOTE:    JNCA  charts (1:3,000,000)  may  be  used;  however  they  are  only  available  from  NGA  as  hardcopy products]. 11.5.2.  Show the following items on the printed chart: 11.5.2.1.  Navigator’s  name,  date  constructed,  chart  number,  and  chart  edition.  Charts printed  from  an  automated  planning  system  will  also  include  DAFIF  and  CADRG currency. Departure and arrival charts will be chummed. 11.5.2.2.  Flight  plan  course  line,  reporting  points,  waypoint  identifier  (to  correspond with  flight  plan),  and  ETP  location.    Flight  plan  doghouses  may  be  displayed  with magnetic course and distance. 11.5.2.3.  Annotate  suitable  emergency  airfields.    Consider  the  following  factors  when selecting emergency airfields:  weather conditions, runway width/length, runway weight-bearing  capacity,  runway  lighting,  radio  navigational  aids  (availability/monitored),  and proximity to planned flight path. 11.5.2.4.  Display appropriate airspace boundaries (e.g., ADIZ, ARTCC, BZ, FIR, UIR), Special Use Airspace (SUAS) boundaries, and TFRs pertinent to the route. 11.5.2.5.  If  available,  display  VVOD  data  on  departure/arrival  charts.    As  a  minimum, under  normal  circumstances  the  filter  height  should  be  set  no  higher  than  100  feet.    NOTE:    When  utilizing  charts  printed  from  automated  flight  planning  systems,  ensure selection of Lambert Conformal Conic map projection when plotting great circle routes.  Not  all  selectable  projections  provide  an  approximation  of  great  circle  routing  when measuring courses between points on the chart. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   105  11.6.  Use  of  Laptop  Computers  during  Flight.  Certified  laptop  computers  with  automated flight planning software are approved for in-flight use IAW AFI 11-202V3.  Portable automated flight  planning  systems,  to  include  moving  map  capability,  are  intended  to  enhance  aircrew situational  awareness.  Consequently, independent  GPS-fed laptop computers, which do not  fall under the category of CNS/ATM avionic systems, will not be considered RNAV equipment for IFR  en  route  or  terminal  navigation,  regardless  if  the  required  navigation  performance  (RNP) value  of  that  airspace  can  be  maintained.  Additionally,  ACC  has  not  provided  operational approval  for  GPS  navigation  equipment  as  a  primary  means  of  navigation  in  remote/oceanic (Category I) areas. 11.7.  Fuel  Planning.  (T-1)  Accomplish  fuel  planning  in  accordance  with  the  certified automated  flight  planning  software  or  applicable  MDS  performance  manual  (T.O.  1C-130H-1-1).    Aircrew  will  accomplish  fuel  planning  on  the  AF  Form  4116  or  certified  automated  flight planning forms which replicate the AF Form 4116.  All other items of the fuel analysis portion of AF  Form  4116  are  explained  in  Table  11.1    NOTE:    For  tactical  mission  fuel  planning, calculations  derived  from  automated  flight  planning  systems  will  be  considered  as  the  primary method and, by exception, 6,000 lbs/hr used in the absence of this capability. Table 11.1.  Air Force Form 4116 Fuel Load Components. ENROUTE.

Never less than 7,000 lbs. 11.7.1.  Fuel  Planning  with  Automated  Flight  Planning  Systems.  When  using  automated flight  planning  tools,  all  required  fuel,  performance,  and  ETP  calculations  may  be  used  in lieu  of  manually  derived  calculations  from  performance  technical  orders.    Add  alternate, identified extra, and reserve fuel in addition to the calculations derived from automated flight planning systems. 11.7.1.1.  When  utilizing  the  automated  flight  planning  flight  performance  model, normally use 970o TIT and 95% engine performance to calculate cruise altitude ceiling, unless directed otherwise by appropriate instructions and technical orders. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   107  11.7.1.2.  When fuel analysis is accomplished using automated flight planning tools, use the fuel flow from the last applicable enroute leg of the computer flight plan to determine the terminal fuel flow value. 11.8.  T.  O.  1C-130H-1-1  Fuel  Planning.    (T-1)  All  times  are  calculated  in  minutes  and  all data is computed using 95% engine performance.  Use the Enroute Fuel Computation Worksheet on the AF Form 4116, page 2/3.  NOTE: When computing fuel using T.O. 1C-130H-1-1, use the appropriate  drag  index.  Standardized  drag  indexes  may  be  established  by  local  OGVs  and published  in  local  supplements.    Before  takeoff,  confirm  the  drag  index  used  with  the  flight engineer to account for any changes to aircraft configuration (e.g., FLIR turret removed). 11.8.1.  There are three distinct phases of flight for which required fuel quantities and or fuel flows  must  be  calculated.    These  three  phases  are:    Initial  climb  out,  start  cruise  and  end cruise.  Procedures for the necessary calculations are as follows: 11.8.1.1.  Prior to any calculations, use the appropriate TO 1C-130H-1-1, Part 4 Figures to  extract  Time  to  Climb  (TTC),  Distance  to  Climb  (DTC),  and  Fuel  to  Climb  (FTC).  Apply the correct  temperature deviation and correct  for pressure  altitude to  compute all climb data. 11.8.1.2.  Using TTC and DTC, calculate climb TAS. 11.8.2.  Initial  Climb-Out  Fuel.  In  the  climb  section  of  the  enroute  fuel  computation worksheet enter takeoff gross weight (TOGW), TTC, and FTC in the appropriate blocks. 11.8.3.  Start Cruise. 11.8.3.1.  Subtract climb fuel from the TOGW to obtain the start cruise gross weight. 11.8.3.2.  Enter the total flight time from the flight plan in the total time block. Subtract TTC from the total time to obtain cruise zone time. 11.8.3.3.  Enter  the  appropriate  TO  1C-130H-1-1  Part  5  figure  to  extract  fuel  flow. Entering  arguments  are  start  cruise  gross  weight,  pressure  altitude  and  temperature deviation.  Fuel flow extracted is per engine. Multiply the extracted fuel flow by four to arrive at fuel flow total. 11.8.3.4.  Divide  the  fuel  flow  total  by  60  and  multiply  by  the  zone  time  in  minutes  to obtain start cruise zone fuel. 11.8.4.  End Cruise. 11.8.4.1.  Subtract cruise zone fuel from the start cruise gross weight to obtain end cruise gross weight. 11.8.4.2.  Enter  the  appropriate  TO  1C-130H-1-1  Part  5  figure  to  extract  fuel  flow. Entering  arguments  are  end  cruise  gross  weight,  pressure  altitude  and  temperature deviation. Fuel flow extracted is per engine.  Multiply the extracted fuel flow by four to arrive at fuel flow total. This is also the terminal fuel flow. 11.8.5.  Average Cruise Fuel Flow. 11.8.5.1.  Average  the  start  cruise  and  end  cruise  fuel  flow  to  obtain  the  average  cruise fuel flow.   108  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 11.8.5.2.  Divide the fuel flow total by 60 and multiply by the cruise zone time to obtain cruise zone fuel total. 11.8.6.  Total  enroute  fuel.  Add  the  FTC  to  the  cruise  zone  fuel  total  to  determine  total enroute fuel. 11.8.7.  Compute preflight endurance using procedures in paragraph 11.3.3 11.9.  Multi-Leg  Fuel  Planning.  (T-1)  See  AF  Form  4116,  page  3.    A  multi-leg  fuel  plan becomes  necessary  when  a  mission  includes  multiple  stops  where  fuel  is  unavailable.  Use  the following procedure for multi-leg fuel planning; assume a three leg mission with legs labeled A, B, C, and D in succession: 11.9.1.  Begin  with  the  final  destination  leg  (C  to  D)  and  fuel  plan  as  normal  to  obtain required ramp fuel. 11.9.2.  Next,  fuel  plan  the  leg  preceding  the  final  destination  leg  (B  to  C).  Include  the required ramp fuel from the C to D leg as identified extra fuel.  Do not include alternate fuel or holding fuel unless those totals exceed the required ramp fuel for the C to D leg. Use 1,000 lbs. for approach and landing. 11.9.3.  Plan the next preceding leg (A to B) as in paragraph 11.8.2 11.9.3.1.  Unidentified  extra  is  only  entered  for  the  first  mission  segment  (A  to  B).   NOTE:  Fuel requirements must be verified at each stopover airfield.  Requirement must be  recomputed  whenever  the  planned  burn  off  changes;  for  example,  enroute  altitude changes, actual cargo/passenger load differs from the estimate, holding is accomplished, diversion  to  alternate  is  required,  etc.      NOTE:    Regardless  of  the  number  of  mission segments  involved,  fuel  planning  is  always  accomplished  by  planning  the  last  leg’s requirements first.  The remaining leg requirements are planned in the reverse order to be flown until the refueling airfield is reached. 11.10.  ETP  Computations.  (T-1)  Wind  Factor  and  ETP  Data  Computations  are  required  on Category I routes or Category I portions of routes when the total time between the last suitable airfield (LSAF) and the  first  suitable airfield (FSAF) is  5 hours or more.  Suitable airfields are those within 100 NM of flight planned course centerline meeting weather, fuel,  weight bearing and minimum runway requirements (IAW Chapter 5). 11.10.1.  In-flight  ETP.    Re-compute  the  ETP  when  the  actual  arrival  over  any  reporting point prior to the ETP exceeds 15 minutes ahead or behind time when the change was caused by erroneous wind information.  If the change was caused by factors other than a change  in the wind (i.e. slow TAS or deviation for weather), simply compute a new ETA to the ETP, as the  ETP  itself  will  not  have  changed.  NOTE:  Wind  factor  and  ETP  computations  are  not required for search missions. 11.10.2.  Wind  Factor  Data:    NOTE:    In  the  following  paragraphs  for  wind  factor computation  convenience,  LSAF  means  after  level-off,  abeam  or  over  LSAF,  or  closest planned  checkpoint  or  radio  aid  within  100  NM  of  LSAF.    FSAF  means  abeam  or  over FSAF,  closest  planned  checkpoint  or  radio  aid  within  100  NM  of  FSAF,  descent  point,  or destination.    Use  any  of  the  options  in  the  ETP  options  graph,  Figure  11.1    Specify  the option used in the ETP computations section of the AF Form 4116. Record computations in the ETP computations section. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   109  11.10.2.1.  TOTAL - Compute the average ground speed (GS) between LSAF and FSAF.  Divide  the  total  distance  between  the  two  end  points  by  the  total  time  between  the  two points:   Total Distance   Total Time = Average GS    Subtract average flight planned true airspeed (TAS) from average GS to obtain the total wind factor.    WF = Average GS  - Average TAS 11.10.2.2.  1st Half.  Compute the average GS between LSAF and approximate midpoint between  LSAF  and  the  FSAF.  Subtract  flight  planned  average  TAS  from  the  computed average GS to obtain the 1st half wind factor. 11.10.2.3.  2nd  Half.    Compute  the  average  GS  between  the  approximate  midpoint  and the FSAF. Subtract flight planned TAS from the computed average GS to obtain the 2nd half wind factor. 11.10.2.4.  ETP Data: 11.10.2.4.1.  DISTANCE  (LSAF  TO  FSAF).  Enter  the  total  distance  (regardless  of level  off)  from  or  abeam  the  LSAF  along  course  from  departure  to  or  abeam  the FSAF along course toward destination. 11.10.2.4.2.  T(    )MIN.    The  flight  time  from  the  ETP  to  the  FSAF  or  return  to  the LSAF. 11.10.2.4.3.  TOTAL  TIME  TO  FSAF  -  T  =  TIME  TO  ETP.    Subtract  the  time,  T(  )MIN, from  the total  flight plan time to the FSAF.  TIME TO ETP  is  the total  time from  departure to  the ETP  (departure and takeoff may not  necessarily be the same).  Compute and record ETA to ETP by adding TIME TO ETP to departure time. 11.10.2.4.4.  Signature Block.  Sign the form after completing the flight plan portion (or  verifying  the  CFP)  and  completing  the  time  and  fuel  analysis,  wind  factor,  and ETP data. 11.11.  In-Flight Procedures.  (T-1) 11.11.1.  The  navigator  will  monitor  the  primary  command  radio  unless  directed  otherwise by the PIC.  The navigator will record ATC clearances and monitor the read back.  This will normally  include  all  ATC  instructions  involving  departure,  enroute,  and  approach procedures.  This  requirement  does  not  apply  to  ATC  instructions  requiring  immediate execution by the pilot,  or when such  action interferes  with  the timely performance of other critical flight duties. 11.11.2.  Departure  and  Approach  Monitoring.  Immediately  after  takeoff,  crosscheck  all available flight instruments with the aircraft radar, IDS (if equipped), moving map, and hard copy  charts  to  ensure  the  aircraft  remains  clear  of  all  obstacles.    During  all  instrument arrivals  and  departures,  use  all  appropriate  navigation  aids  to  ensure  an  accurate  flight profile.  During arrivals and departures, open the appropriate terminal instrument procedure plate to  monitor all phases of the terminal procedure.   Immediately notify  the pilots  of any deviations.    Assist  in  clearing  for  other  aircraft  when  possible  and  practical,  but  not  to  the detriment  of  monitoring  proscribed  terminal  procedures.    Unless  directed  otherwise  by  the PIC and never to the detriment of safety, confine activities to these critical duties during all terminal phases of flight.   110  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 11.11.3.  Flight Following.  The navigator will flight follow on all IFR/Category II missions using a suitable aeronautical chart IAW paragraph 11.5 11.11.4.  Compute  a  TAS  check  when  portions  of oceanic/Category I airspace of 3 hours or more. Use procedures in paragraph 11.15 the  planned  route transiting 11.11.5.  Malfunctions  or  loss  of  onboard  navigational  capability,  which  degrades  required navigation  performance,  will  be  immediately  reported  to  ATC  and  annotated  on  the  flight log. Subsequently, follow procedures IAW paragraph 11.12.2 11.11.6.  Conduct in-flight fuel management procedures when portions of the planned route transiting oceanic/Category I airspace are 5 hours or more. 11.11.7.  Heading Deviation Checks. (Not applicable to dual INU aircraft) Heading deviation checks are required when portions of the planned route transiting oceanic/Category I airspace are 3 hours or more. 11.12.  Flight  Records  Completion  (AF  Form  4116).  (T-1)  Flight  progress  will  be  recorded for  Category  I  routes  of  3-hours  or  longer.    Record  enough  detail  to  reconstruct  the  mission. Units may publish local standards for log procedures in the unit supplement.  See AF Form 4116, page 5. 11.12.1.  Standard Log Procedures.  The AF Form 4116 will consist of planning and in-flight progress  data.  The  form  will  be  completed  in  accordance  with  this  regulation  and  local supplements in  sufficient  detail  as to  fully  evaluate or  reconstruct  the  flight.   Page 1 of the form  will  be  completed when  a  CFP  is  not  available  on  Category  I  routes.    Page  4,  the  in-flight  section,  will  be  used  to  record  present  positions  and  spot  readings.    The  procedures below  are  designed  to  accommodate  a  wide  range  of  HC-130  navigation  equipment configurations. 11.12.1.1.  As  soon  as  practical  after  level-off  or  coast-out,  whichever  occurs  last, navigators will verify aircraft position by either navigation aid fix or radar fix. 11.12.1.1.1.  Record the fix in AF Form 4116 Section VIII. 11.12.1.1.2.  At the time of the fix record the primary navigation solution in AF Form 4116  Section  VI,  VIII  or  in  the  REMARKS  portion  of  Section  X.    Corresponding deltas or coordinates for all other navigation solutions should also be recorded. 11.12.1.1.3.  At the time of the fix record as a minimum:  GMT, present position, true heading,  spot  wind,  TAS,  altitude  and  ETA  to  the  next  waypoint  in  AF  Form  4116 Section IX. 11.12.1.2.  After coast out and in between hourly fixes, record current position every 30 minutes on AF  Form 4116, Page 4 in  Section VI, VIII  or in  the REMARKS  portion of Section X. 11.12.1.3.  Plot  the  current  position  every  hour  or  within  10  minutes  of  crossing  an oceanic/Category I reporting point, whichever occurs first. 11.12.1.3.1.  Record the GMT, current position of the primary navigation system, true heading, spot w/v, true air speed, altitude, ETA to the next point, and corresponding deltas for all other navigation solutions. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   111  recorded  positions, 11.12.1.4.  Between the  NAV DATA/REMARKS  portion  of  section  IX  of  the  AF  Form  4116  at  regular  intervals  to allow for calculating a Dead Reckoning Position (DR) in the event of a navigation system failure. record spot readings in 11.12.1.4.1.  Spot  readings  will  include  as  a  minimum,  time,  heading,  drift  angle, ground speed, wind vector, and true airspeed. 11.12.1.5.  As  soon  as  practical  prior  to  coast-in,  navigators  will  verify  aircraft  position by either navigation aid fix or radar fix. 11.12.1.5.1.  Record the coast-in fix in AF Form 4116 Section IX. 11.12.1.5.2.  At the time of the coast-in fix record the primary navigation solution in AF  Form  4116  Section  VI,  VIII  or  X.    Corresponding  deltas  or  coordinates  for  all other navigation solutions will also be recorded.  Spot readings for the coast-in fix are the same as the coast-out fix. 11.12.2.  In the event of a navigation system failure (INU or GPS) full log procedures will be implemented.    Beginning  at  the  last  plotted  position,  compute  a  DR  up  to  the  present position. Plot a fix or most probable position (MPP) at a minimum of once per hour.  A dead reckoning position associated with the fix/MPP will be plotted on the chart prior to plotting the  position.    If  the  navigation  system  failure  is  resolved,  the  navigator  may  resume  log procedures as outlined in paragraph 11.12.1 11.12.2.1.  At  the  time  of  the  fix/MPP  record  the  GMT,  current  position,  true  heading, spot w/v, true air speed, altitude and ETA to the next point. 11.13.  Inflight Fuel Management Procedures.  (T-1) 11.13.1.  Record  the  fuel  readings  listed  below  at  level  off  time  and  regular  time  intervals (coinciding  with  entries  on  aircraft  performance  record),  not  to  exceed  1  hour  and  30 minutes.  Use  the  worksheet  on  page  4,  Section  VII  of  the  AF  Form  4116  to  complete  in-flight fuel management computations. 11.13.1.1.  ETA DEST.  Best known arrival time at destination. 11.13.1.2.  TIME.  Time of the fuel reading. 11.13.1.3.  TERMINAL FUEL FLOW. 11.13.1.4.  FUEL FLOW [Current]. 11.13.1.5.  AVG  FUEL  FLOW.    Calculate  by  adding  terminal  fuel  flow  to  current  fuel flow and dividing the sum by 2. 11.13.1.6.  FUEL  REMAINING.    Fuel  quantity  at  time  of  calculation.  In  the  interest  of safety, use the lower of the calculated or gauge fuels. 11.13.1.7.  MIN DIV/OVHD FUEL.  Required overhead fuel (item 13 of the fuel plan). 11.13.1.8.  DIFF.  Subtract O/H Fuel from FUEL REM. 11.13.1.9.  FUEL ETE.  Calculate using formula in paragraph 11.13.2.3 11.13.1.10.  ETE DEST.  Subtract TIME from ETA DEST.   112  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 11.13.1.11.  EXTRA TIME.  Subtract ETE DEST from FUEL ETE. Report this value to the pilot. If this is a negative value, check the computation and values for errors. If they are correct, evaluate your destination options. 11.13.2.  Use the following formulas to accomplish in-flight fuel management: 11.13.2.1.  (Terminal fuel flow + Present fuel flow)  / 2 = Average Fuel Flow 11.13.2.2.  Present fuel – Overhead fuel = Usable Fuel 11.13.2.3.  Usable fuel / Average fuel burn rate = Fuel ETE 11.13.2.4.  Fuel ETE – ETE to destination = Extra Time 11.13.3.  AF  Form  4125,  Range  Control  Chart  may  also  be  used  for  in-flight  fuel management. 11.13.3.1.  Manual Construction (see Figure XXXX). 11.13.3.1.1.  “POINT  NUMBER”  represents  the  approximate  level-off  point  (initial cruise altitude), 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of the flight plan distance as indicated on AF IMT 4116 or CFP. 11.13.3.1.2.  Column  A, “ENROUTE  AND  DESTINATION  FUEL”:  AF  IMT  4116 takeoff fuel minus enroute reserve fuel. 11.13.3.1.3.  Column  B,  “ENROUTE  FUEL”:  The  fuel  (enroute  +  identified  extra fuel)  planned  to  be  burned  off  by  the  time  each  of  the  given  points  defined  in paragraph 11.13.3.1.1 are reached. 11.13.3.1.4.  Column  C,  “MINIMUM  FUEL”:  Subtract  Column  B  (ENROUTE FUEL)  from  column  A  (ENROUTE  AND  DESTINATION  FUEL).  This  fuel  is  the minimum, at each given point, to fly from that point to destination with sufficient fuel to  make  a  missed  approach  (if  required),  continue  to  the  destination  alternate,  hold, make the planned approach, and land with 6,000 pounds of fuel. Minimum fuel will also  include  any  identified  extra  fuel  needed  overhead  the  alternate  (e.g.,  excess holding, for succeeding legs, etc.). The minimum fuel at the 100 percent point should be the same as required overhead fuel. 11.13.3.1.5.  Column D, “DISTANCE”: The flight plan distance for the given points listed  in  paragraph  11.13.3.1.1,  obtained  from  AF  IMT  4116.  This  can  be graphically depicted as either distance flown or distance remaining. 11.13.3.1.6.  “DISTANCE  FLOWN/REMAINING”:  Label  the  nautical  miles  to  the destination along the horizontal scale. For distance flown start with 0 at the left and allow  the  major  blocks  to  represent  convenient  increments  of  mileage.  NOTE:  The distance scale should be expanded to the maximum to give as large a presentation as possible. 11.13.3.1.7.  Draw  a  vertical  line  on  the  graph  representing  total  distance  to destination and label this line with the destination name. 11.13.3.1.8.  Estimated  Performance/Minimum  Arrival  Fuel  Lines.  Estimated Performance is based on planned fuel at T/O, level off, and arrival plotted parallel to the minimum fuel line. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   113  11.13.3.1.9.  A “minimum arrival” line will be constructed by plotting fuel in column C versus distance in column D. 11.13.3.1.10.  An “estimated performance” line will be constructed by plotting a line parallel  to the minimum  arrival  line based on planned take-off, level  off and  arrival fuel.  NOTE:  The  difference  between  the  estimated  performance  line  and  the minimum  arrival line is reserve and unidentified  extra fuel.  If required, plot  vertical lines representing ETPs at the appropriate distance flown/remaining. 11.13.4.  The navigator may terminate these procedures one hour from destination, when the Category I route segment is completed, or at the discretion of the PIC. 11.14.  Heading Deviation Check Procedures (Not applicable to Dual INU aircraft).  (T-1) 11.14.1.  Heading checks should be computed in Section V of AF Form 4116, page 4.  The heading deviation check solves for “deviation” (DEV) for all heading reference systems.  The SCNS  allows  the  navigator  to  input  compass  “deviation”  for  the  number  one  and  two compasses.  In this case reverse the sign of the “deviation” to arrive at “deviation correction” and input corrections into the SCNS FLT PRMTR 2-3 page.  NOTE:  Compass deviation is not  necessarily  constant  over  time  or  after  significant  course  changes.    Navigators  should reconfirm  deviation  on  Category  I  routes  every  3  hours  or  after  planned  course  changes  of greater  than  30  degrees.    EXCEPTION:  A  deviation  check  is  not  required  on  flights transiting Category I routes of less than three hours if:  1. The aircraft is equipped with two or more operable heading systems (the standby compass is not considered a system for this requirement).  2. The difference between systems does not exceed 2-degrees. 11.14.2.  Deviation checks not required for Dual INS equipped aircraft. 11.14.3.  Single  INS/SCNS  Heading  Checks.  Record  and  compare  the  INS/SCNS  magnetic heading with all compass systems. 11.15.  True  Airspeed  (TAS)  Check  Procedures  (not  applicable  for  HC-130(H)N aircraft).  (T-1) 11.15.1.  TAS  checks  should  be  computed  in  Section  IV  of  AF  Form  4116,  page  4.  Accomplish as soon as practical or within one hour of initial cruise altitude. Record time of the check and  altitude on the pressure altimeter.  If using free  air temperature gauge, record indicated  outside  air  temperature  (IOAT).  Use  the  heat  of  compression  table  on  AF  Form 4116 to convert IOAT to true outside air temperature (TOAT). If using SCNS temperature, record TOAT. 11.15.2.  Navigators  can  use  0  knots  for  indicated  airspeed  (IAS)  to  calibrated  airspeed (CAS)  correction  and  minus  3  knots  for  CAS  to  equivalent  airspeed  (EAS)  correction  for TAS above 270 (or minus 2 knots if less than or equal to 270). 11.15.3.  ITAS  –  Indicated  TAS.  Record  the  TAS  reading  from  the  TAS  meter  and  the SCNS/INS or other computer (if the aircraft is so equipped). Record the difference between computed TAS and this reading in the CORR block. 11.16.  Grid  Procedures.  Refer  to  AFPAM  11-216  for  definitions  and  formulae.      NOTE:  Entering  arguments  include  a  Grid  convergence  factor  which  can  only  be  obtained  from hardcopy NGA charts.  Current automated flight planning tools utilizing CADRG NGA charts do not provide these values.   114  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 11.16.1.  SCNS Grid Procedures. For description of SCNS Grid operations procedures, refer to T.O. 1C-130-1-4, Section II. 11.16.2.  Manual  Grid  Procedures.  (T-1)  The  navigator  will  use  the  AF  Form  4116,  page 7/Section XI when grid navigation procedures are required. Block entries are as follows: 11.16.2.1.  Time.  Time of heading/system heading observation. 11.16.2.2.  TH.  Observed/computed true heading. 11.16.2.3.  CA/LONG.  Enter +W –E longitude (polar chart) or convergence angle. 11.16.2.4.  GH.  Observed/computed grid heading. 11.16.2.5.  GYRO  #1,  GYRO  #2.    On  aircraft  equipped  with  two  independent  gyro stabilized systems with numbers corresponding to aircraft systems (e.g. C-12 No. 1, N-1 No 2), circled number denotes the primary steering gyro.  On aircraft whose systems are not  numbered  or  do  not  correspond  to  the  aircraft  system,  identify  the  primary  steering gyro in “REMARKS”. 11.16.2.6.  GR.  Gyro reading.  Record the reading from the primary compass. 11.16.2.7.  PREC.    The  amount  of  precession  since  the  last  heading  shot  (period precession): GH – GR = PREC. 11.16.2.8.  RATE/CUM.  The hourly precession rate based upon the precession indicated at the time of observation.  Precession rate is derived from the period precession and the applicable  elapsed  time  period  (since  the  last  compass  reset).    Example:  2  degrees precession in 40 minutes equals a 3 degrees/hour precession rate.  This entry is required only when period precession  is  greater than one  degree.  The  cumulative portion of the block  is  used  for  tracking  the  cumulative  precession  rate  once  a  false  latitude  has  been set. 11.16.2.9.  LAT.  The mid-latitude between the current observation and the next proposed observation. 11.16.2.10.  FALSE LAT.  The false latitude setting being used to eliminate precession. This entry is required only when a false latitude setting is used. 11.16.2.11.  RESET.  Whenever a gyro is reset, place a check mark in this block. 11.16.2.12.  GC.  Measured grid course to the next checkpoint. 11.16.2.13.  DRIFT.  The number of degrees (+ or -) of drift. 11.16.2.14.  DGH.  Desired grid heading. Apply anticipated DRIFT to GC. 11.16.2.15.  RT/2 CORR.  See formula on the bottom of the AF Form 4116. 11.16.2.16.  IGH.  Initial grid heading. Used for alter heading. 11.16.2.17.  GRID  ENTRY.    Apply  grivation  (GRIV)  to  Magnetic  Heading  (MH)  to obtain desired grid heading (DGH); or apply (LONG) or convergence angle (CA) to True Heading  (TH)  to  obtain  DGH.  See  formulas  on  the  AF  Form  4116.    NOTE:    Grid convergence factors can only be obtained from hardcopy NGA charts. Current automated flight planning tools utilizing CADRG NGA charts do not provide these values. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   115  11.16.2.18.  GRID EXIT.  Apply GRIV to DGH to obtain MH; or apply LONG or CA to DGH to obtain TH.  See formulas on the AF Form 4116. 11.16.3.  En route Requirements: 11.16.3.1.  The Grid Entry/Exit section of the AF Form 4116 will be completed prior to heading  reference  changes.    When  entering  grid  operation,  spot  grivation  should  be applied  to  the  computed  magnetic  heading  to  obtain  DGH.    The  aircraft  will  be established on the computed magnetic heading prior to resetting the heading references.  When exiting grid, the computed magnetic headings will be the target heading when the compass  systems  are  reset.  In  both  cases,  the  computed  magnetic  headings  will  be compared to the flight plan to verify the accuracy of the courses measured and conversion data  used.    This  will  ensure  the  validity  of  initial  entry  headings  and  provide  precise target headings for exit. 11.16.3.2.  Normally, the grid heading will be checked each 30-minutes after grid entry. If  the  compasses  are  precessing  3  degrees  per  hour  or  less,  hourly  checks  may  be obtained after the first hour. 11.16.3.3.  Determine the precession information for each gyro after each heading check. When a gyro’s precession is greater than 1 degree, reset the gyro to correct grid heading.  When the period precession is 1 degree or less, the navigator may either reset the gyro or treat the precession as zero. 11.16.3.4.  Whenever the period precession is greater than 1 degree (optional for 1 degree or  less),  the  hourly  precession  rate  may  be  removed  by  use  of  a  false  latitude  setting.  When  the  combined  earth  rate  and  gyro  precession  are  less  than  +15  degrees/hour,  the false  latitude  setting  will  totally  compensate  for  precession.    Two  considerations  are necessary: 11.16.3.4.1.  Predicted precession becomes zero. 11.16.3.4.2.  It  may  be  necessary  to  adjust  previous  DR  and  air  plot  positions  if  the precession  rate  changes  at  subsequent  heading  checks.    If  this  occurs,  adjustments normally  will  be  small  and  have  negligible  effect  on  DR  and  air  plot  accuracy; however, the effect should be considered. 11.16.3.5.  To  determine  false  latitude  correction,  enter  the  earth  rate  table  with  the desired  latitude  and  extract  the  tabulated  earth  rate  value.    Algebraically  combine  the earth rate value and the observed hourly precession rate (use cumulative precession rate once a false latitude has been set).  Re-enter the earth rate table with the combined value and extract the corresponding false latitude. 11.16.3.6.  Only  15  degrees/hour  can  be  removed  by  a  false  latitude  setting.    When  the sum of earth and primary gyro precession rates exceeds +15 degrees, the navigator must artificially steer the aircraft (in effect, the aircraft will fly a gentle arc) to compensate for the amount of precession in excess of +15 degrees/hour.  The formula used to correct the DGH  to  an  initial  grid  heading  (IGH)  to  fly  appears  on  the  AF  Form  4116  as  “RT/2 CORR” (note that the formula produces a correction, so the precession rate must be given its opposite sign).  The precession rate used in the formula must be adjusted to reflect the time  period  in  the  DR  ahead.    When  “carrying”  precession  as  suggested  above,  the   116  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 navigator should consider several  aspects  of the  navigational problem:     NOTE:  When precession exceeds 15 degrees per hour, consider the compasses unusable. 11.16.3.6.1.  If  alter  headings  are  not  made  at  heading  check  times,  precession  will have  accumulated  by  alter  heading  times  and  a  correction  (opposite  sign  of precession) should be applied to the IGH using the total precession correction portion of the AF Form 4116. 11.16.3.6.2.  If  the  precession  rate  changes  at  subsequent  heading  checks,  it  may  be advisable  to  adjust  previous  DR  and  air  plot  positions  described  at  paragraph 11.16.3.4.2 11.16.4.  Miscellaneous Procedures: 11.16.4.1.  Normally, when changing charts or crossing the 180 degree meridian, only the reference  changes;  the  heading  of  the  aircraft  is  not  altered.    The  change  is  made  by comparing the grid courses and applying the difference to the gyro reading (old chart GC 350 degrees; new chart GC 331 degrees; GR 353; 350 – 331 = 019 = 334; reset the gyro to read 334). 11.16.4.2.  Always  recheck  computations  and  formulas  when  a  radical  change  in precession is observed. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   117  Figure 11.1.

In addition to duties in the flight manual and other applicable technical orders, flight engineers will comply with the procedures and duties specified in this instruction. The PIC may assign other mission-related duties to the flight engineer as necessary. 12.2.  Authority to Clear Red X.  (T-1) Flight engineers are not normally authorized to clear a Red X. In a situation where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are unavailable,  the  flight  engineer  may  obtain  authorization  to  clear  the  Red  X  from  the  home station MXG/CC or designated representative. Other crewmembers are not authorized to clear a Red  X.  EXCEPTION:    The  flight  engineer  may  clear  Red  Xs  for  engine  intakes  and  exhaust, engine  panels  and  covers,  pitot  covers,  gear  pins,  and  SPR  drains  when  qualified  maintenance personnel  are  not  available,  unless  prohibited  by  the  home  station  MXG/CC,  OG/CC,  or representative. 12.3.  In-Process Inspections (T-1).  All flight engineers must be aware of their responsibility to perform  in-process  inspections  when  clearing  Red  X  symbols.  During  the  assembly  or reassembly of an item at those stages where further assembly will prevent the required inspection of  the  item,  an  in-process  inspection  will  be  performed.  Document  the  in-process  inspection IAW T.O. 00-20-1). 12.4.  Aircraft  Servicing  (T-1).  Flight  engineers  normally  are  not  required  to  refuel  or  defuel C-130  aircraft;  however,  the  flight  engineer  is  qualified  and  authorized  to  accomplish  these duties  when  maintenance  personnel  are  unavailable.  This  policy  is  designed  for  support  of  the aircraft and mission while away from home station. The flight engineer will use T.O. 00-25-172 and  T.O.  1C-130H-2-12JG-10-1,  Job  Guide—Ground  Handling,  Fuel  System  Servicing  and Concurrent Servicing, during all servicing operations. When concurrent servicing is required the flight engineer will be the Concurrent Servicing Supervisor (CSS) and follow instructions from T.O. 00-25-172 and T.O. 1C-130H-2-12JG-10-1. If ground support personnel are not available, the PIC will designate other crewmembers to assist the flight engineer. 12.5.  Forms Management.  In addition to the procedures in T.O. 00-20-1 and AFI 11-401, the flight  engineer  will  assist  the  pilot  in  maintaining  the  AFTO  Form  781.  Verify  the  exceptional release is signed before starting engines and re-signed, if necessary, at en route stops.  After each flight, ensure the number of discrepancies (if any), landings, and flight duration time(s), etc., are entered  on  AFTO  Form  781H.    Review  all  AFTO  Form  781A  discrepancies  and  ensure  clear, detailed entries are made, symbols, date discovered, and when discovered codes are entered for each discrepancy and the discovered blocks are signed. 12.6.  Flight  Monitoring.  (T-1)  The  flight  engineer  will  monitor  aircraft  systems  during  all phases  of  flight  and  ground  operations.    Notify  the  pilot  of  all  abnormal  indications  and  take action as required. 12.6.1.  Maintain outside vigilance when flight deck duties allow. 12.6.2.  Monitor the primary radio, inter-plane radio, interphone systems, and HOT LISTEN. 12.6.3.  Advise and assist the pilot in maintaining required climb and cruise power.   124  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 12.6.4.  Monitors  aircraft  instruments,  cross  checks  aircraft  altitude  and  terrain  clearance using NVGs and the radar altimeter during modified contour/low level operations. 12.6.5.  Ensure pilot/copilot radar altimeter is set correctly for the specific low level altitude. 12.6.6.  Flight  engineers  will compute zero and 50 percent  obstacle clearance speeds for all low level operations, prior to entering low level environment. 12.6.7.  During low level operations the flight engineer will state “190 Knots” when enroute airspeeds  decay  to  190  Knots.  Flight  engineers  will  further  announce  to  the  aircrew  in  10 knot  increments  below  190  knots  (e.g.  “180”,  “170”)  until  airspeed  exceeds  190  knots. EXCEPTION: not required for planned slowdowns (HAAR, airdrops, etc.). 12.6.8.  Assist in field acquisition and visually checks that the LZ is clear of obstacles. 12.6.9.  State  "17,000"  over  interphone  when  any  engine  torque  approaches  this  value.  NOTE:  In the event of an inadvertent over-torque see Table 12.1 for required actions: Table 12.1.  Over-Torque Conditions and Required Actions. Over-Torque Condition Torque > 19,600 in lb. < 21,500  Torque >21,500 in lb. < 23,000 in lb.  Torque > 23,000 in lb. < 23,260 in lb.  Required Action(s) 781A  entry;  historical  tracking  only,  no  inspection required.  781A entry; visual inspection within 25 hours.   781A  entry;  maintenance  required  for  NDI  and engine  mounts  change  within  25  flight  hours.  Reduction  Gearbox  may  require  change  if  gearbox oil pressure is lower than before over-torque.  NOTE:    The  25  flight  hour  criteria  are  based  on  flight  time  to  return  the  aircraft  for maintenance. Aircraft that experience an over-torque exceeding 23,000 in pounds of torque are to immediately return the aircraft for inspection/maintenance.  WARNING: Failure to comply with these criteria could result in catastrophic structural failure.  12.6.10.  Notify the pilot when any of the following is noted: 12.6.10.1.  Deviation  of  more  than  200  feet  from  assigned  altitude  or  10  KIAS  from assigned airspeed. 12.6.10.2.  The aircraft configuration is incorrect for the maneuver being performed. 12.7.  Tactical  Checklists.  When  the  pilot  initiates  a  tactical  checklist,  read  and  ensure  timely completion of all checklist items. 12.8.  C-130 Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD) Cards.  (T-1) 12.8.1.  Takeoff and immediate landing data for the departure airfield will be completed prior to takeoff. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   125  12.8.2.  TOLD Cards. Use AF IMT Form 4064V2 and AF IMT Form 4063V2 (mini card) or locally produced and approved at OGV level, C-130 TOLD Card. Complete data applicable to  the  type  of  takeoff  and  landing  to  be  made  (i.e.  landing  distance  for  normal  landing; ground roll for Maximum Effort landings). 12.8.3.  Record computed data in accordance with the flight manual and this volume. 12.8.4.  Base  all  performance  calculations  on  95  percent  engine  efficiency  without  nose wheel steering unless mission requirements dictate otherwise.  Reference paragraph 5.15 for guidance  concerning  when  nose  wheel  steering  is  authorized  for  performance  data calculations. 12.8.5.  Accomplish  TOLD  card  computations  using  performance  manual  data,  MAJCOM-approved tabulated data or TOLD computer [approval authority is the MAJCOM Stan/Eval function]. 12.8.5.1.  Record  adjusted  speeds  to  be  used;  i.e.,  record  minimum  control  speed  (one engine inoperative in ground effect) as take-off speed if minimum control speed is higher than computed takeoff speed. 12.8.5.2.  Following  initial  takeoff  and  landing,  only  affected  speeds  need  to  be  re-accomplished  if  favorable  conditions  afford  an  additional  margin  of  safety  in  all  other areas  (e.g.,  gross  weight  decreases  due  to  fuel  burnoff,  while  pressure  altitude  and temperature remain constant). New data is required for pressure altitude changes of 1,000 feet, gross weight changes of 5,000 pounds, or temperature change of 5 degrees C. 12.8.6.  When stop-and-go operations are planned, the runway remaining for takeoff  must be greater  than  or  equal  to  balanced  or  unbalanced  CFL,  whichever  is  greater.  If    maximum effort  take-off    is  utilized,  runway  remaining  must  be  greater  than  or  equal  to  MFLMETO corrected for VMCA. 12.8.7.  The  minimum  TOLD  card  computations  (airspeeds)  required  for  a  termination landing are: air minimum control speeds, obstacle clearance speed, three engine climb speed, 50 and 100 percent flap landing speeds. The flight engineer will post flaps up approach speed for aircraft equipped with GCAS/GPWS during night or IMC approaches. 12.8.8.  Pararescue/Jumper  Minimum  Operating  Speed  (PJ  MOS).    The  flight  engineer  will compute a PJ MOS for all static line personnel drops and post this information on the card. Compute  data  using  power  off  stall  speed  with  50  percent  flap  setting  at  30  degree  bank angle plus 5 knots. 12.9.  Aircraft  Structural  Integrity  Program  (ASIP).  (T-1) An automated inspection, repair, corrosion  and  aircraft  tracking  (AIRCAT)  worksheet  (electronic  or  paper  copy)  will  be completed  for  all  flights  IAW  T.O.  1C-130-101.  AIRCAT  worksheets  will  be  entered  into  the AIRCAT  reporting  system  within  72  hours    of  the  flight  or  return  from  TDY.  Deployed  units will  establish  criteria  to  input  AIRCAT  data  within  a  reasonable  time  period  depending  on network support of the deployed unit. If unable to obtain connectivity with the AIRCAT server due  to  austere  conditions,  units  will  attempt  to  inform  OGV  of  the  situation  and  any  delays  in AIRCAT reporting. 12.10.  AF  IMT  Form  4108,  Aircraft  Fuel  Usage  Log.  (T-2)  The  AF  IMT  Form  4108  is sufficient  for  normal  operational  requirements  and  is  used  as  a  simple  method  of  recording   126  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 aircraft fuel usage data. When additional data is required for identifying trends in engine failure, performance, or for special test programs, the directing headquarters will furnish necessary forms and instructions. Maintain AF IMT Form 4108 in accordance with the following paragraphs. 12.10.1.  Responsibility.  The flight engineer assigned to the flight will complete the AF IMT Form 4108 whenever the navigator completes an AF Form 4116. The log may also be filled out as necessary for training and to maintain flight engineer proficiency. Coordinate with the navigator for fuel reading clock times. 12.10.2.

However, for the first cruise immediately prior to en route or step climb and the last cruise prior to descent may be no less than 30 minutes, nor more than 90 minutes. 12.10.2.6.4.  final letdown that occurs when landing procedures begin. The loss in altitude during final letdown is indicated by "L&T". Landing and taxi is that condition from the end of the last entry in the sequence of descents/cruise to engine shutdown on the ramp. Holding  time  during  an  approach  must  be  accounted  for  as  an  additional  cruise AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   127  condition  after  descent  when  necessary  (30  minutes  holding  or  more).  Descents  of 4,000  feet  or  less  will  not  be  recorded  separately  but  will  be  indicated  in  the preceding  cruise  segment.

Enter  the  amount  of  fuel consumed (Block 19 plus Block 20) for the flight condition as determined by calculation. 12.10.2.23.  Block  23  -  Total  (Calc  Fuel  Remaining).  Enter  the  total  amount  of  the calculated  fuel  remaining  by  subtracting  the  amount  in  Block  22  from  the  amount  in Block 23 of the previous flight condition. This total reflects the calculated fuel remaining at the END clock time in Block 7. AR condition, enter cumulative total of fuel (indicated by individual gage reading) on board aircraft after refueling. 12.10.2.24.  Block 24.  This Block is unlabeled to facilitate entering total ramp fuel from Block  2  weight  data.  Enter  the  ramp  calculated  fuel  aboard  obtained  by  either measurement with the dipstick and applying any known correction factor or as indicated by the total of the fuel quantity indicators. On reverse side of the form this Block is used to carry forward the previous quantity from the front side. 12.10.2.25.  Block 25 - Gage Period (Gage Fuel Remaining).  Enter the fuel used for the flight  condition  as  determined  by  fuel  gage  readings  for  the  present  condition  as compared  to  the  fuel  gage  readings  for  the  previous  condition.

General.  This  Chapter  provides  guidance  on  mission  planning  and  procedures, requirements  and  restriction  for  HC-130  tactical  employment.    It  provides  parameters  used  to employ  the  techniques  and  procedures  of  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130  and  other  tactics  manuals.  If  a discrepancy  exists  between  this  instruction  and  a  tactics  manual,  the  information  in  this instruction will take precedence. 15.2.  Personnel  Recovery  Fundamentals.  Personnel  Recovery  (PR)  is  the  umbrella  term  for operations  focusing  on  recovering  captured,  missing,  or  isolated  personnel.  Detailed  TTPs  for  the tactical execution of PR are contained in AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. 15.3.  Mission  Roles.  HC-130  crews  share  a  common  core  of  training,  equipment,  and capability to perform the following roles in direct support of PR operations: 15.3.1.  Search operations. 15.3.2.  Helicopter air-to-air refueling (HAAR). 15.3.3.  Forward area refueling point (FARP) operations/hot refueling. 15.3.4.  Guardian Angel deployment via infil/exfil or airdrop. 15.3.5.  Transload/medical evacuation. 15.3.6.  On-Scene Commander (OSC). 15.3.7.  Airborne Mission Coordinator (AMC). 15.3.8.  Rescue Mission Commander (RMC). 15.4.  Crew  Duties.  (T-1)  All  crewmembers  will  perform  normal  crew  duties  as  outlined  in appropriate flight manuals and other chapters of this instruction.  NOTE:  All crewmembers will monitor en route progress should an escape and evasion situation develop. 15.5.  Checklists/In-flight  Guides.  Amplified  tactical  checklist  and  guidance  is  located  in Attachments  2  through  5  of  this  instruction.  Abbreviated  checklists/briefing  guides/in-flight guides are located in separate publications, AFI 11-2HC-130V3, CL-1 and CL-2. 15.5.1.  The  flight  engineer  reads  all  tactical  checklists  unless  briefed  otherwise  by  the aircraft commander. (T-1) 15.5.2.  AMSS will respond with “Radio” for any required checklist responses. 15.5.3.  Checklist items not applicable to the aircraft or mission/event being flown need not be  challenged  during  checklist  accomplishment  to  (e.g.,  Air  Deflector  Doors  -  "Closed  and Off" need not be challenged if air deflector doors were not opened). 15.6.  Mission  Planning  Factors.  Refer  to  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130  for  in-depth  mission  planning considerations. 15.7.  Aircrew  Briefings.  (T-1)  Aircrew  briefings  will  be  conducted  IAW  Chapter  6  of  this instruction and the guidance below:   142  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 15.7.1.  During  the  mission  crew  briefing,  the  aircraft  commander  will  brief  all  applicable items from the aircraft commander’s briefing guide in AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-1. 15.7.2.  Tactical  Briefs.  All  tactical  sorties  will  include  a  route  study  and  tactical  briefing.  The  navigator  will  conduct  the  tactical  briefing  and  brief  all  applicably  items  from  the Navigators Briefing Guide located in 11-2HC-130V3 CL-1. 15.7.3.  Pilots  and  navigator  are  required  to  attend  the  tactical  route  study  and  brief.  It  is highly desirable the AMSS attend when duties allow. 15.8.  Night Vision Goggle (NVG) General.  (T-1) 15.8.1.  Limitations.  All  aircrew  will  be  familiar  with  the  limitations  associated  with  NVG use  as  discussed  in  AFMAN  11-217V2,  Instrument  Flight  Procedures  and  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130.    NOTE: The route study should emphasize NVG limitations and performance factors and their impact on terrain and obstacle clearance. 15.8.2.  Preflight.  All crewmembers will perform a thorough preflight of their NVGs. 15.8.3.  Inflight  Requirements.    When  NVG  use  is  required,  the  pilots,  navigator,  flight engineer, loadmaster, airborne mission systems specialist, and scanners should wear them or have them immediately available based on mission requirements. 15.8.3.1.  Pilots will wear NVGs with similar acuity and gain.     WARNING: NVGs and associated  components  (battery  cords,  safety  cords,  and  other  hardware)  can  become entangled  with  the  fire  handles,  overhead  panel  switches,  or  other  controls.    Any interference  can  cause  inadvertent  engine  shutdown,  or  repositioning  of  other  critical switches or controls.  Extreme care must be exercised by pilots during seat changes and by  flight  engineers  performing  duties  that  involve  leaning  forward  in  the  seat;  i.e. exchanging TOLD cards or adjusting fuel panel switches. 15.8.3.2.  Panoramic NVG (PNVG) Usage.  AN/AVS-10 PNVGs are only authorized for use by pilots. 15.8.4.  Spare  NVGs  and  Batteries.    Mission  requirements  and  duration  of  the  deployment will be determining factors for the total number of NVG sets required. The PIC must ensure there is one spare set of preflighted NVGs (can be either the AMSS or Navigator's set). Each crewmember will carry spare batteries for their NVGs. 15.9.  Mountainous  Terrain.  For planning  and  execution, Mountainous terrain  is  defined  as a 500 ft or greater terrain differential in ½ NM or less. 15.10.  Minimum and Emergency Safe Altitudes (MSA and ESA).  (T-1) 15.10.1.  Minimum  Safe  Altitude  (MSA).    MSA  is  an  intermediate  altitude  which  will provide terrain clearance, yet limit threat detection during situations that require leaving the modified contour profile. 15.10.1.1.  Calculate  the  MSA  for  en  route  low  level,  airdrop  and  SCAs  by  adding  500 feet  above  the  highest  terrain  or  obstacle  within  3  NM  of  centerline  or  planned  flight path, whichever is higher, and rounded up to the next 100-foot increment. 15.10.1.2.  Calculate the MSA for helicopter air refueling legs by adding 1000 feet (2000 feet in designated mountainous terrain) to the highest terrain or obstacle within 5 NM of AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   143  centerline  or  planned  flight  path,  whichever  is  higher,  and  rounded  up  to  the  next  100-foot increment. 15.10.2.  Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). ESA provides a safe altitude which ensures terrain clearance. 15.10.2.1.  A  single  ESA  will  be  established  for  the  entire  route  when  there  are  no significant changes in topography. For routes where the terrain does vary significantly, a separate  ESA  may  be  established  for  route  segments  with  similar  terrain  or  obstacle elevations. 15.10.2.2.  Calculate  ESA  by  adding  1,000  feet  (2,000  feet  in  designated  mountainous terrain) to the highest elevation or obstacle within 10 NM of centerline or planned flight path, whichever is greater, and rounded up to the next 100-foot increment. 15.11.  Chart Requirements.  (T-1) 15.11.1.  Planned low level routes will be drawn on a 1:500,000 (TPC or Sectional) or larger scale  chart.    Use  a  1:250,000  (JOG)  or  larger  scale  chart  for  overland  threat  penetration operations,  mountainous  NVG  low-level  operations,  and  the  objective  areas,  unless  not available  or  of  an  inferior  quality  to  a  TPC.    WARNING:  Mixing  multiple  coordinate  data can  cause  significant  navigation  and  target  errors.  The  consistent  use  of  data  for  all coordinates greatly reduces these errors. Ensure the same datum is used to derive coordinates for  all  mission  requirements.    NOTE:  Color  copies,  laminated,  and  PFPS  charts  are acceptable forms of hardcopy charts provided the contour and contrast remain intact and the chart  is  used  for  preflight  route  study  and  the  flight.  If  laminated  charts  are  used,  the  crew will ensure that the laminate does not degrade the quality or readability of the chart and that all data remains intact.   NOTE: For local training routes, if a mountainous NVG route has been planned using a JOG and elevations and altitudes are verified, the route may be flown with reference to a TPC or Sectional. 15.11.2.  Chart Construction. At a minimum, low-level charts will be annotated IAW Table 15.2, Required Chart Annotations. In addition, the following general instructions apply: 15.11.2.1.  Use  dark  ink,  pencil,  or  symbol  tapes  to  portray  course  lines.  Obstacles  and other chart entries may be drawn or highlighted in any legible color. 15.11.2.2.  The chart code, scale, and edition will be annotated on the chart 15.11.2.3.  The current CHUM/ECHUM/DAFIF (review date included) will be annotated on the chart. 15.11.2.4.  Course Arrow Box. A course arrow box will be provided for each leg.  At a minimum  the  course  arrow  box  will  include  leg  magnetic  course,  distance,  and  MSA. Where the leg is split between two charts, use the course arrow box on both. 15.11.2.5.  Print the ESA in bold numbers on the chart. When multiple ESAs are used, or when lengthy strip charts are used, the ESA will be annotated on each chart segment. 15.11.2.6.  When  stripped  charts  are  used,  a  larger  scale  chart  (i.e.,  ONC,  JNC)  will  be prepared by the navigator to allow for major unplanned deviations during critical mission phases and emergency egress. 15.11.2.7.  When transitioning from one chart to another, allow a sufficient route overlap.   144  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 15.11.2.8.  Draw course lines using either point-to-point or radius of turn. 15.11.2.8.1.  If using point-to-point, measure true course and distance from point-to-point. 15.11.2.8.2.  If using radius of turn see Table 15.1 15.11.2.8.3.  True course is measured from the end of the turn to the next turn point Table 15.1.

Annotate appropriate warning and advisory locations on the chart (e.g., 20, 10, 6, and 1 minute). 15.11.2.10.  Draw deviation lines when the planned route is different than the course line. Annotate  magnetic  heading  information  near  these  deviation  lines  (if  desired)  to  aid  in dead reckoning during significant turns. 15.11.3.  Chart Annotation. Use the annotation symbology provided in AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. and listed below for marking mandatory chart requirements. 15.11.3.1.  Start  climb  points  and  their  associated  NVG  altitude  will  be  annotated  on charts at the required distance to  go where the start climb is to be initiated on each leg. Any  of  the  following  annotation  styles  are  acceptable:  “S/C  17/12/3500”  or  “S/C 17/3500/12”  or  “S/C  3500/17/12”.  These  examples  indicate  a  climb  to  the  reference altitude  of  3,500  feet  MSL  that  should  be  started  at  17  NM  to  go  and  to  be  at  NVG altitude by 12 NM to go. 15.11.3.2.  Start  descent  points  for  MCAD  conducted  in  IMC  will  be  annotated  and calculated IAW AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 IFR Drop Corridor procedures. Table 15.2.  Mandatory Chart Requirements (T-1).

The  Navigator  will  carry  a  hardcopy  chart  (or  set  of  charts  as  required)  that covers all enroute and objective mission areas. 15.11.4.2.  Between the pilots, a single hardcopy chart (or a single set of hardcopy charts as required) that covers all mission enroute and objective areas will be carried. The pilot and copilot may share a single low level/objective area chart during flight. If this option is used, both the pilot and copilot must participate in pre-mission route analysis using this single chart(s). 15.11.4.3.  An overview chart of at least 1:1,000,000 (ONC) scale should be available to both the navigator and AMSS. 15.12.  Use  of  Laptop  Computers  during  Flight.  Electro-magnetic  Interference  (EMI) certified  laptop  computers  and  software,  such  as  portable  flight  planning  system  (PFPS),  are   146  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 allowed  in-flight  IAW  AFI  11-202V3.  Depending  on  aircraft  modification,  these  laptops  can receive positional data from a portable commercial GPS system with external/window mounted antenna  or  from  the  navigational  system  data  bus.  If  used  properly,  these  systems  enhance situational awareness (e.g., “Moving Map,” PFPS/ FalconView/TaskView/Threat Overlays, Intel Feeds) and provide an ability to re-plan missions in-flight. 15.12.1.  These  systems  do  not  replace  existing  navigation  equipment,  must  not  be  used  as the  sole  means  of  navigation,  and  must  not  interfere  with  the  accomplishment  of  normal duties. 15.12.2.  Each user must have a back-up paper chart immediately available in case use of the system is denied. 15.13.  Barometric  Altimeter  Updating.  Altimeter  update  points  should  be  planned  for  en route  portions  of  the  mission.  Sources  of  update  include  weather  forecast,  ground  reporting stations, and crew updates. See AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 for altimeter updating procedures. 15.13.1.  Obtain an updated altimeter setting as close to the objective area as possible. If this is not possible, use the lowest forecast altimeter setting. 15.13.2.  Apply  cold  weather  altimeter  corrections  to  any  reference  any  barometric  altitude (MSA, ESA, NVG altitude, drop altitude, SCA profile altitudes, SCA minimums, etc.) used during low level operations whenever the outside air temperature is below 32º F/0º C. 15.14.  Radar Altimeter Usage during Tactical Operations.  (T-1) 15.14.1.  Low  level  Settings.    Set  radar  altimeters  no  lower  than  10%  below  minimum enroute  altitude  (i.e.  minimum  setting  of  450  feet  for  500  foot  NVG  modified  contour  and 180 feet for day threat penetration at 200 feet).  NOTE:  During modified contour low level procedures, regardless of the radar altimeter setting used, if the aircraft is below the desired modified  contour  altitude,  a  correction  to  altitude  should  be  made.  Do  not  wait  for  the  low light to illuminate to begin a correction. 15.14.2.  Airdrop Settings. 15.14.2.1.  Low Altitude Airdrops.  The radar altimeter should be set no lower than 10% below drop altitude. 15.14.2.2.  High Altitude Airdrops.  Set the radar altimeter at the discretion of the aircraft commander. 15.14.3.  Any  crewmember  noting  illumination  of  the  "Low"  warning  light  on  the  radar altimeter will state the word "Low" to indicate this to the pilot flying and the crew. 15.14.4.  The  pilot  and  Navigator  will  use  the  same  radar  altimeter  setting.  EXCEPTION:  When conducting airland operations using the INFIL/EXFIL Checklist. 15.15.  Use of TCAS and GCAS during Tactical Operations.  (T-1) 15.15.1.  ETCAS may be operated in TA only mode during low-level operations. 15.15.2.  ETCAS will be operated in TA only mode during airdrop and HAAR operations. 15.15.3.  GCAS.  AUDIO ON/VISUAL OFF or AUDIO OFF/VISUAL ON may be used to set the GCAS system to tactical mode. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   147  15.16.  Minimum  Operating  Equipment  Requirements.  (T-1)  The  minimum  operating equipment  required  for  tactical  employment  events  is  contained  in  Table  15.3    Aircrew experience  level  and  mission  factors  may  dictate  greater  equipment  requirements  than  those listed.

It provides parameters used to employ the techniques and procedures of AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. Section 16A—Enroute Operations 16.2.  Minimum IFR En Route Altitude (T-1). 16.2.1.  Minimum  IFR  en  route  altitude  is  IAW  AFI  11-202V3  as  supplemented.  EXCEPTION:    For  contingency  operations,  compute  minimum  IFR  en  route  altitude  by adding 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation) within 5 NM of the route centerline.  Round  this  altitude  up  to  the  next  100-foot  increment.    For  routes  where  the  terrain  varies significantly,  a  separate  minimum  IFR  en  route  altitude  may  be  established  for  route segments with similar terrain or obstacle elevations. 16.2.2.  Descent  below  IFR  minimum  altitudes,  listed  above,  is  only  authorized  under  the following conditions: 16.2.2.1.  Intercepting glideslope for an approved IMC SCA, or 16.2.2.2.  Reaching the Drop Zone Entry Point for a MCAD. 16.2.2.3.  Established  on  an  ATC  provided  minimum  radar  vectoring  altitude  available from a suitably equipped and capable radar facility. 16.2.2.4.  Established  on  a  published  IFR  route  or  instrument  approach  procedure compatible with aircraft navigation systems. 16.2.2.5.  IMC Descent to VFR. 16.3.  Search Operations.  Conduct search operations IAW AFTTP 3.3-HC-130. 16.4.  Low Level Operations.  Tactical operations conducted below 3,000 feet AGL under VFR are considered low level. 16.4.1.  Minimum Equipment Requirements.  See Table 15.3 16.4.2.  Weather  Minimums.  Modified  contour  low  level  operations  will  be  conducted  in VMC.  NOTE:  This does not preclude the pilot from the VFR filing requirements in AFI 11-202V3  or  applicable  ICAO/host  nation  requirements  if  operating  outside  CONUS. WARNING:  Inadvertent  encounters  with  IMC  during  VFR  operations  is  an  emergency procedure,  requiring  an  immediate  climb  to  a  pre-calculated  obstacle  safe  altitude,  an appropriate  IFF  squawk,    and  a  radio  call  to  the  area  air  traffic  control  agency.  During contingency or combat missions, the necessity of flying "comm-out" in  IMC, as allowed in SPINs or mission directives, to complete a mission must be evaluated against the increased possibility of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) and mid-air collision. 16.4.3.  Lowest  Acceptable  Altitude  (LAA).  During  training  operations,  higher  weather  or altitude  minimums  may  be  dictated  by  FLIP,  ICAO  procedures,  training  considerations  or AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   149  crew  experience.    Lowest  altitudes  allowed  for  enroute  modified  contour  low-level operations are: 16.4.3.1.  Day.    LAA  will  be  300  feet  modified  contour  above  the  terrain  (except  when using  Threat  Penetration  Altitude),  by  visual  reference  to  both  the  terrain  and  the  radar altimeter.    Momentary  terrain  clearance  deviations  may  be  expected  due  to  terrain variance. 16.4.3.2.  NVG  Low-Level.  LAA  will  be  500  feet  modified  contour  above  the  terrain (except  when  using  Threat  Penetration  Altitude),  by  visual  reference  to  both  the  terrain and the radar altimeter.  Momentary terrain clearance deviations may be expected due to terrain variance. 16.4.4.  Simulated Emergencies During Low Level Training. Simulated emergencies may be conducted  during  enroute  low-level  training  on  local  routes.  Aircrew  will  comply  with  the following restrictions in addition to those listed in Chapter 9. 16.4.4.1.  Restricted to flat or rolling terrain 16.4.4.2.  Simulated  emergencies  will  only  be  conducted  on  specific  legs  identified during crew brief. 16.4.4.3.  Do not compound emergencies. 16.4.4.4.  As  determined  by  the  instructor  pilot,  initiate  a  climb  to  an  intermediate altitude,  DFA,  or  MSA.    Continue  to  climb  to  or  maintain  required  altitude  until  the completion of the simulated emergency. 16.5.  Threat Penetration Altitude.  (T-1) 16.5.1.  During  combat  operations  limit  the  time  spent  at  threat  penetration  altitude  to  the duration needed to avoid the specific threat. 16.5.2.  Threat penetration altitudes may be flown during training operations.  The following restrictions apply: 16.5.2.1.  A mission IP must be in either seat. 16.5.2.2.  Not authorized on unfamiliar routes. 16.5.2.3.  Restricted to flat or rolling terrain. 16.5.2.4.  No "Break" calls or "Hard Turn" calls may be made. "Turn" calls are allowed.  If  a  turn  requires  more  than  20  degrees  angle  of  bank,  the  aircraft  will  terminate  threat penetration  operations  and  immediately  climb  to  a  normal  modified  contour  profile, MSA, or ESA as required. 16.5.2.5.  No simulated emergencies allowed. 16.5.2.6.  LAA  is  200  for  day  VMC  operations  and  300  feet  for  NVG  operations.  WARNING:  Bank  angles  are  severely  restricted  below  200  ft  AGL.    Due  to  the  close proximity  to  the  ground,  aircrews  must  be  cautious  of  any  descending  vector  that  may develop during threat penetration operations. 16.6.  NVG Low Level Specific Requirements.  (T-1)   150  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 16.6.1.  Lunar  Illumination  Criteria.  There  is  no  minimum  illumination  requirement  to conduct NVG modified contour low level operations. Aircrews will use 0.8 millilux (.00008 lux)  effective  illumination  as  a  standard  for  low  illumination  and  increased  risk  mitigation. This roughly equates to 10% lunar illumination on a clear night. When effective illumination is  below  0.8  millilux,  crews  will  obtain  squadron  CC/DO  approval  prior  to  flight,  add  low illumination  as  a  factor  in  their  risk  assessment,  and  mitigate  the  risk.  This  may  require changing profile, airspeeds, or altitudes among many other options. 16.6.2.  NVG  Altitudes  and  Start  Climb  Points.  The  navigator  will  compute  NVG  altitudes and start climb points for all NVG low level routes. NVG altitude and start climb points will be annotated on navigator and pilot/copilot charts and briefed in the route study.  See AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 for addition information on NVG Altitudes. 16.6.2.1.  NVG  Altitudes.  NVG  altitudes  are  altitudes  designed  to  provide  planned modified  contour  terrain  clearance  over  the  planned  flight  route.  Crews  will  plan  NVG altitudes  based  off  of  terrain  and  obstacles  1  NM  left  and  right  of  route  centerline  or planned  deviation.  When  a  significant  tactical  advantage  (e.g.,  ridge  crossings,  flight parallel to ridgeline) can be gained by reducing the NVG altitude basis to 0.5 NM (3,035 feet/1,013 yards) left and right, crews may elect to do so. 16.6.2.2.  Start  Climb  Points.  Start  Climb  Points  are  predetermined  points  defined  on  a chart at a distance-to-go (DTG) where the aircraft should start a climb to a NVG altitude based on an obstacle on its flight-path. 16.6.2.2.1.  Start  climb  points  will  be  computed  during  mission  planning,  annotated on all charts, and briefed during route study for all significant climbs (when there is a terrain  differential  of  1000  feet  or  greater  over  4  nautical  miles  or  less.  This  is  a minimum and rapidly rising terrain must be evaluated for the entire leg). Regardless of planned visibility or illumination, tailwind effects must be considered. Continue to evaluate  planned  climb  schedule  during  execution.   One-engine  inoperative performance must be considered. 16.6.2.2.2.  Start Climb Point Calculations. Calculate start climb points IAW AFTTP 3-3.HC-130.  Climb rate should normally be based on 1,000 feet per minute.  Density altitude, aircraft gross weight and tailwinds may require pilots to add distance to their start  climb  points.    NOTE:  Due  to  errors  in  DTED,  consider  using  reported  DTED accuracy  (if  available)  and  applying  it  to  the  user-specified  buffer  altitude  when computing NVG altitudes. 16.6.3.  Enroute  and  Objective  Area  Navigation.  Accomplish  obstacle  avoidance  at  night using NVGs, radar, SCNS, IDS/FLIR (some airplanes), and radar altimeter along with flying NVG altitudes as necessary to ensure terrain clearance. Higher altitudes up to MSA may be required.    WARNING:  Because  of  the  distinct  possibility  of  crewmembers  experiencing spatial  disorientation  during  NVG  low-level  flight  or  low  illumination  NVG  air  refueling, one  pilot  should  be  immediately  ready  to  fly  the  aircraft  should  the  other  pilot  become disoriented. 16.6.3.1.  The  primary  source  for  NVG  low-level  altitude  is  visual  pilotage.    Therefore navigators should assume that the aircraft will be at the lowest possible point within the corridor  for  the  intended  NVG  ground  track  plan  and  base  start  climb  points  there,  not AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   151  from  the  last  NVG  altitude  prior  to  the  start  climb  point.  When  calculating  start  climb points in this manner, greater terrain differentials will result, which will place start climb points  further  away  from  critical  terrain.  This  conservative  approach  will  result  in  less aggressive  climb  profiles,  allowing  the  aircraft  to  retain  a  greater  amount  of  energy  in mountainous terrain. 16.6.3.2.  Pilots will inform the crew any time the aircraft descends below the navigator’s NVG altitude, once the controlling terrain is called in sight.  WARNING: If at any time the  pilot  loses  sight  of  the  NVG  altitude  controlling  terrain,  the  crew  will  fly  the  NVG altitudes computed by the navigator. 16.6.3.3.  If  a  higher  NVG  altitude  is  based  on  an  obstruction  beyond  the  flying  pilot's line  of  sight,  the  navigator  will  direct  a  climb  at  the  start  climb  point  to  the  new  NVG altitude until such time the obstruction becomes visible to the flying pilot. At this time, a decision to continue the climb or fly below NVG altitude can be made. 16.7.  Low-Level  Emergency  Procedures.  (T-1)  The  procedures  listed  below  apply  to  both training  and  contingency  operations.    EXCEPTION:  During  combat  operations,  if  a  climb  to MSA/ESA will expose the aircraft to  greater hazard due to  enemy threat  detection, the aircraft commander may climb to a Detection Free Altitude (DFA) or intermediate altitude during a low level emergency.  The decision to use this altitude vice MSA/ESA must be based on a thorough pre-mission  assessment  of  enemy’s  overall  threat  detection  capability  and  the  nature  of  the emergency  encountered.      NOTE:  Climb  to  MSA  when  either  pilot  must  leave  the  seat  during low level flight. EXCEPTION:  If performing a planned seat swap for training with an IP in the seat, climb to a safe altitude. 16.7.1.  Crew  Disorientation.  If  a  crew  becomes  lost  or  disoriented  on  a  low-level  mission, immediate steps must be taken to regain the planned flight path. 16.7.1.1.  Start a climb to ESA. Continue the climb until the ESA is reached or a positive fix  obtained.  While  higher  altitude  increases  the  field  of  vision  and  reduces  the  terrain hazard, it may make the airplane more vulnerable. A fix, visual or radar, should be found as soon as possible. 16.7.1.2.  After  obtaining  a  positive  fix,  descend  and  resume  low-level  operations.  The navigators will crosscheck timing and adjust as necessary. 16.7.2.  Pilot  Spatial  Disorientation  or  Inoperative  NVGs.    WARNING:  The  PM  must  be ready  to  immediately  take  control  of  the  aircraft  if  the  flying  pilot  experiences  spatial disorientation or a malfunction of his/her NVGs. 16.7.2.1.  If either pilot experiences spatial disorientation, start a climb to at least MSA.  Continue to climb to or maintain at least MSA until the pilot experiencing the problem is ready  to  assume  PM  or  PF  duties.    Low-level  operations  may  be  continued  at  the discretion of the PIC. 16.7.2.2.  If  either  pilot’s  NVGs  become  inoperative,  start  a  climb  to  at  least  MSA. Maintain  at  or  above  MSA  until  the  NVG  malfunction  has  been  resolved.    Low  level operations may be continued at the discretion of the PIC.   152  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 16.7.3.  Inadvertent  Weather  Penetration.    Climb  to  MSA  if  unable  to  avoid  flight  into weather conditions that prohibit VMC operations.  A further climb to ESA may be required.  The route may be resumed after VMC is reestablished. 16.7.4.  Aircraft  System  Failure.  When  a  known  or  suspected  malfunction  prevents continued safe low level operations, start a climb to at least MSA.  Continue to climb to or maintain  at  least  MSA  until  all  troubleshooting  and/or  required  flight  manual  procedures have been accomplished.  If minimum equipment requirements are met IAW Chapter 4 and Table 15.3, low-level operations may be continued at the discretion of the PIC.  Aircraft not meeting minimum operating equipment requirements will fly at MSA or higher. 16.7.5.  Emergency  Climb  Procedure.  (T-1) The decision to  execute an emergency climb should be made as soon as possible and should be considered in cases of, but not limited to, certain  equipment  malfunctions,  spatial  disorientation,  inadvertent  weather  penetration,  loss of  situational  awareness,  and  imminent  contact  with  the  terrain.  Any  crew  member  may initiate an emergency climb  by stating “Emergency Climb.” See  Table  16.1 for emergency climb procedure.  WARNING: Flight engineers will compute flaps up (High Boost) and 50% flap  obstacle  clearance  speeds  for  all  low  levels,  prior  to  departure.  During  low-level operations,  the  flight  engineer  will  state  “190  knots”  when  enroute  airspeed  decays  to  190 knots.  Flight engineers will further announce to the aircrew in 10 knot increments airspeeds below  190  knots  (e.g.  “180”,  “170”)  until  the  airspeed  exceeds  190  knots.    EXCEPTION: Not required for planned slowdowns (HAAR, airdrops, INFIL/ EXFIL, etc). Table 16.1.  Emergency Climb Procedures. 1. Announce “Emergency Climb” to the crew. 2. Simultaneously set maximum power on all operating engines and close all bleed air valve switches.  WARNING: Power settings greater than 19,600 pounds of torque may be required to clear an obstacle. Torque settings of 19,600 to 21,500 only require a AFTO form 781A entry and no inspection is required. Aircraft that experience an over-torque over 23,000 inch-pounds are to immediately return the aircraft for inspection and required maintenance.  CAUTION: Closing the bleed valves will result in depressurizing the aircraft. Use caution in areas of high terrain as cabin altitude may exceed 10,000 feet. The onset of hypoxia symptoms may complicate judgment. 3. Ensure temperature datum control valve switches are in auto unless malfunction prevents compliance). 4. Close ramp and door (if open). 5. For zero flaps (e.g., en route) climb the aircraft at zero flap obstacle clearance speed.  For any flap setting (e.g., airdrop, HAAR) set flaps to 50 percent and climb out at 50 percent flap obstacle clearance speed. 6. Turn away (with consideration for stall margin) from terrain if feasible. If not possible, climb straight ahead for the maximum climb angle.   WARNING: If at flaps up obstacle clearance speed and turning is required, additional flaps may be necessary to avoid an accelerated stall. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   153   WARNING: To prevent a stall, do not slow below obstacle clearance speed. A low altitude stall has a high probability of resulting in a crash and loss of life.  WARNING: A wings level climb will result in the maximum angle/rate of climb. Any bank angle during this procedure will result in a lower than possible climb gradient and increases stall speed. 7. The PM will monitor and call airspeed as appropriate. 8. The navigator will state an MSA, monitor terrain (via radar, chart, etc.) and call “Clear of Terrain” when above all critical terrain.  If the straight-ahead flight path vector will not ensure terrain clearance, the navigator will state optimum heading. 9. When clear of all terrain, adjust pitch, power, and airspeed for a normal climb out and level off and return all switches to their normal position.  WARNING: Pilots will ensure sufficient stall margin exists prior to commencing turn.  WARNING: If  impact with terrain is imminent, use 100 percent flaps, gear up, at 10 knots above power off stall speed and land the aircraft straight ahead. Section 16B—Terminal Area Operations 16.8.  Self-Contained Approach (SCA).  (T-1) SCA procedures may be used for approaches to conventional airfields and assault zones, and for either overt or covert airland operations. SCAs may  be  conducted  using  the  INFIL/EXFIL  Checklist  or  the  normal  DESCENT,  BEFORE LANDING Checklist. 16.8.1.  SCA  Restrictions.  Comply  with  local  ATC  restrictions  and  host nation  agreements, as appropriate. 16.8.2.  Weather  minimums:  SCAs  will  be  conducted  in  VMC  unless  the  procedure  is published for  IMC use by  National  Geospatial-Intelligence Agency  (NGA) or approved for IMC use by MAJCOM/A3 IAW AFI 11-202V3. 16.8.2.1.  IMC SCA weather minimums will be no lower than 300 ft and 1 SM. 16.8.2.2.  For NGA-published SCAs, use published minimums but no lower than 300 foot ceiling and 1 SM visibility. 16.8.3.  Minimum Equipment Requirements.  See Table 15.3 16.8.4.  Missed Approach Point (MAP). 16.8.4.1.  For VMC SCAs, the MAP will be at zero distance to go on the SCNS at MDA. 16.8.4.2.  For  IMC  SCAs,  the  missed  approach  point  will  be  as  1NM  or  as  published, whichever is greater. 16.8.5.  Pre-mission Requirements 16.8.5.1.  SCA  Construction.    Construct  SCAs  IAW  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130  and  the following: 16.8.5.1.1.  Chart scale and construction requirements are IAW paragraph 15.11   154  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 16.8.5.1.2.  The navigator will construct an approach plate for the SCA using the AF IMT  Form  4118,  SCA  Planning  Form,  the  approach  planning  tool  (APT)  in FalconView, or an OGV-approved planning form. 16.8.5.2.  Plan  a  minimum  7  NM  approach  unless  prohibited  by  the  order  of  battle.  Turning  SCAs,  dogleg  SCAs,  etc,  will  be  planned  and  executed  IAW  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130.  If an SCA is developed for IMC use, it is recommended to plan a minimum of a 10 NM straight in. 16.8.5.3.  Minimum  Descent  Altitude  (MDA).  To  compute  MDA,  add  300  feet  to  the Touchdown Zone Elevation (TDZE). 16.8.6.  Mandatory SCA calls. 16.8.6.1.  At the initial Point, the navigator will make distance calls at every mile inside ten miles and every half mile inside three miles (or as briefed).  In addition, he/she will make the following calls during the approach. 16.8.6.1.1.  “Begin  Descent” WARNING:    Prior  to  making  this  call,  the  navigator  will  verify  that  actual  aircraft position is inside the planned SCA obstacle template. initiate  descent  on to the  SCA  glidepath.       16.8.6.1.2.  “100 Above” to announced 100 ft above the MDA. 16.8.6.1.3.  “Minimums” announced at the MDA. 16.8.6.2.  “Go-around.”  A  go-around  will  be  announced  and  initiated  at  the  MAP  if  the LZ has not been visually acquired, a safe landing cannot be accomplished, or if directed. 16.8.6.3.  Immediate  Landing Feasible.  If a  go-around occurs and an immediate landing is feasible and desired, the PF will announce intentions and maneuver to a VFR pattern. 16.8.7.  Approach Execution: 16.8.7.1.  General.  Each  pilot  will  silently  ensure  both  NVG  batteries  are  operational during the ENROUTE Checklist. 16.8.7.2.  Inbound  to  the  LZ.  Maintain  en  route  profile  until  descent  to  MDA.  Initiate slowdown at the point identified during mission planning. 16.8.7.2.1.  Pilot Flying.  The PF will steer to the LZ using the flight director system or following the navigator's headings. 16.8.7.2.2.  Pilot Monitoring. The PM will back up the PF on the instruments/displays and confirm terrain clearance using all means available. The PM and flight engineer will clear for obstacles and other traffic. 16.8.7.2.3.  Navigator.  The navigator will: 16.8.7.2.3.1.  Determine  the  most  accurate  altimeter  setting  for  the  LZ  using  all available sources including GPS, weather forecasts, ground station reporting and altitude calibration, as available. 16.8.7.2.3.2.  [At  the  Initial  Point]  Confirm  LZ  alignment  with  radar  and/or FLIR/IDS, and give final course headings as required. 16.8.7.2.3.3.  Confirm SCNS position using preplanned update points and provide AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   155  corrections as needed. 16.8.7.2.3.4.  Confirm  LZ  centerline  alignment  on  short  final  using  all  available means and correct aircraft alignment if required.          NOTE: The FLIR/IDS is helpful  in  LZ  identification  and  should  be  used  to  scan  the  LZ  for  obstructions, but it is not intended to be used to fly the entire SCA. 16.8.8.  Slowdown. 16.8.8.1.  The  navigator  will  initiate  the  slowdown.  Slowdown  should  be  initiated approximately 3 NM prior to the planned glide slope intercept point. 16.8.8.2.  The  PF  will  slow  the  aircraft  to  no  less  than  50  percent  threshold  speed, configure  the  flaps  and  gear  as  airspeed  permits,  and  call  for  the  appropriate  checklist (SLOWDOWN/BEFORE  LANDING  portion  of  the  INFIL/EXFIL  checklist  or  normal BEFORE  LANDING  checklist).  Call  for  100  percent  flaps  as  airspeed  permits.  Ensure 100 percent flaps are set prior to reaching threshold speed.  For turning SCAs, maintain 140 KIAS or 50% flap approach speed whichever is higher in the turn. 16.8.8.3.  Altimeters.  Radar altimeters should remain set at enroute altitude setting until slowdown. Once slowdown is initiated, the radar altimeters may be reset as briefed. The navigator should set 300 feet to guard against shallow glide slopes. 16.8.9.  Descent.    Upon  approaching  glide  slope  intercept  the  navigator  will  confirm  the accuracy  of  the  barometric  altimeter  setting  by  comparing  actual  AGL  and  MSL  altitudes with those depicted on the SCA template. 16.8.9.1.  Glide  Slope  Intercept.  The  pilot  flying  will  begin  descent  upon  navigator direction.    WARNING: The  PM  and  navigator  must  closely  monitor  radar  altimeters  to ensure accuracy of altimeter settings to prevent inadvertently flying below planned AGL minimums. 16.8.9.2.  At glide slope intercept the navigator will state “Begin Descent” and repeat the desired initial  descent  rate. The navigator, backed up by the PM, will provide glidepath advisories  referenced  from  navigator‘s  pressure  and  radar  altimeters  and  backed  up  by SCNS.  These  calls  will  be  made  at  ½  NM  intervals  until  reaching  the  “Minimums”  or “100 feet”  call.  The Navigator will state any deviation  in  excess  of 150 feet  explicitly. The  navigator  also  advises  the  pilot  if  the  aircraft  is  correcting  to  or  diverging  from glidepath  and  how  “Rapidly”  as  appropriate.  As  a  guide,  the  following  criteria  may  be used for glideslope deviation calls: 16.8.9.2.1.  “Slightly above” or “Slightly Below”..........50 feet 16.8.9.2.2.  “Above” or “Below”.....................100 feet 16.8.9.2.3.  “Well Above” or “Well Below” .............150 feet WARNING: Use of glideslopes greater than 5 degrees can cause descent rates in excess of 1,000 feet per minute. Extreme care must be taken to break high descent rates with application of power prior to touchdown. In no case will a descent below 300 feet AGL be initiated prior to 2 NM to touchdown. This would cause the glideslope to be too shallow.  16.8.10.  Transition from Minimum Decision Altitude (MDA) to Landing/Go-Around.   156  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 16.8.10.1.  Do  not  descend  below  MDA  until  the  LZ  environment  is  identified  visually and  confirmed  by  both  pilots.  Whoever  identifies  the  LZ  first  will  call  “ZONE  IN SIGHT, relative clock position and any discrepancies (i.e., lights out, etc.)”. Both pilots will then confirm the zone and cross-check the alignment for the proper heading. 16.8.10.2.  Initiate a go-around at the MAP if the LZ environment has not been visually acquired or if the aircraft is not in a position to execute a safe landing.  See  paragraph 16.12.6  for go-around and immediate landing feasible. 16.8.11.  IMC  SCA  Procedures.            NOTE:  When  performing  IMC  SCAs,  at  the  ACs discretion, the copilot may fly the IMC portion of the SCA and upon transitioning to VMC the PIC will assume control for the VMC portion and landing. 16.8.11.1.  A  system  update  and  altimeter  update  are  conducted  within  10  minutes  of starting the IMC SCA. 16.8.11.2.  IMC SCA Altitude. At 10 NM or the IP, whichever is closer to the LZ, fly a minimum of 500 feet above the highest obstruction within 2 NM either side of the run-in centerline to the Begin Descent point. The IMC SCA altitude may be segmented. 16.8.11.3.  Significant/Critical Obstacles.  If a significant or critical obstacle exists within the  standard  SCA  template  (see  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130)  do  not  descend  below  500  feet above the obstacle until the obstacle is positively identified visually or on the radar. 16.9.  FOR FUTURE USE. 16.10.  NVG Airland Operations (T-1). 16.10.1.  General.  VMC  NVG  airland  operations  will  normally  be  conducted  using  the INFIL/EXFIL  Checklist.  SCA  procedures  will  be  used  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.  However, other tactical visual approaches may be used if the pilot is appropriately certified, mission/training  requirements  dictate,  and  the  approach  is  accomplished  IAW  airland operations  procedures  in  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130.    NOTE:    When  using  other  tactical approaches,  the  pilot  will  call  “Slowdown  Now”  initiating  the  SLOWDOWN/BEFORE LANDING  Checklist.  Do  not  descend  below  300  feet  AGL  until  the  LZ  environment  is identified visually and confirmed by both pilots. Whoever identifies the LZ first will call out "Zone  In  Sight",  its  clock  position,  and  any  discrepancies  noted  (i.e.,  any  lights  out,  etc.). Both pilots will then confirm the zone and crosscheck the alignment for the proper heading.  The navigator/engineer will make standard Infil/Exfil altitude advisory calls on descent. For further, guidance see Section II of the flight manual. 16.10.2.  Aircrew Requirements. Pilots and Flight Engineers will be NVG airland qualified; Navigator will be SCA qualified. 16.10.3.  Runway  and  Taxiway  Requirements.  See  paragraph  5.15  for  normal  and maximum  effort  runway/taxiway  requirements.    See  paragraph  9.7  for  minimum  runway required for NVG touch and go operations. 16.10.4.  Minimum Equipment Requirements.  See Table 15.3 16.10.5.  A  go-around  point  will  be  identified  during  pre-mission  planning  for  all  NVG airland operations. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   157  16.10.6.  If the aircraft commander determines there is sufficient illumination, landing lights may remain off during NVG airland operations. 16.10.7.  Blacked-Out  (AMP-4)  Runway  Operations.  Training  operations  will  be conducted IAW the restrictions and requirements of AFI 11-202V3, as supplemented. 16.10.8.  Loss of NVGs. 16.10.8.1.  On  final,  if  either  pilot  loses  use  of  their  NVGs  inside  1NM  on  final,  a  go-around  will  be  executed.    Exceptions  for  contingency  operations  will  be  prebriefed.  If either pilot experiences a malfunction of his/her NVGs during an NVG landing, the PM must be able to assume control and execute the appropriate action.  The copilot must be ready to turn on overt landing and taxi lights to assist in the maneuver executed. 16.10.8.2.  On the ground, the aircraft commander will determine whether to continue the landing rollout or takeoff roll. The copilot must be ready to turn on overt landing and taxi lights to assist in the maneuver executed. 16.10.8.3.  After takeoff. Continue the climb-out, transfer aircraft control as required, and follow  the  appropriate  procedures  for  loss  of  NVGs  (Start  a  climb  to  MSA  for uncontrolled airfield or follow ATC climb-out if applicable). 16.11.  Tactical  Approaches.  (T-1) Aircrews  will  conduct  tactical  approaches  (Overhead, downwind, random steep, and random shallow) IAW the airland operation procedures found in AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. 16.11.1.  NVG  Tactical  Approaches.  Tactical  recovery  certified  pilots  may  conduct  NVG random steep and random shallow approaches to AMP 1, 2, 3 or 4 marked landing zones. 16.11.2.  Restrictions. 16.11.2.1.  Stall  speeds  for  45  and  60  degrees  of  bank  (clean)  will  be  checked  prior  to accomplishing random shallow approaches.  NOTE: 60-degree bank stall speed is equal to 1.4 times wings level stall speed. 16.11.2.2.  When  performing  tactical  approaches,  adhere  to  flight  manual  maneuvering and configuration restrictions. 16.12.  Infil/Exfil Operations.  (T-1) The INFIL/EXFIL Checklist/procedures are typically used to transition from the low level to place the aircraft on final approach, properly configured, in a position  to  identify  the  landing  area,  complete  a  landing,  conduct  a  rapid  onload  or  offload  (if required), and quickly return to low level flying. 16.12.1.  General.  The  INFIL/EXFIL  Checklist  is  used  during  tactical  operations  and replaces the normal DESCENT, BEFORE AND AFTER LANDING, BEFORE TAKEOFF, LINE UP, and AFTER TAKEOFF Checklists from appropriate flight manual. The checklist can be used for day or NVG operations and to make overt and covert/blacked-out landings. 16.12.2.  Aircraft Preparation. 16.12.2.1.  Chemical  lights.  Attach  chemical  lights  to  each  emergency  exit  handle  with tape  in  such  a  way  as  to  allow  a  small  amount  of  light  to  shine  through.    WARNING: Chemical lights attached to exit doors and emergency escape hatch handles will remain in place until mission completion.   158  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 16.12.3.  Loadmaster (LM) Requirements. 16.12.3.1.  Loadmaster  Infiltration/Exfiltration  Guide.  Loadmasters  will  use  the  AFTTP 3-3.HC-130, Attachment 10, Loadmaster Infiltration/Exfiltration Guide to amplify flight manual procedures and guidance found in this instruction. 16.12.3.2.  LMs will wear NVGs during blacked-out operations. 16.12.3.3.  LMs  will  wear  NVGs  on  aircraft  with  NVG-compatible  lighting;  however, they may be raised when NVG lighting is illuminated. 16.12.4.  Approach to LZ. 16.12.4.1.  Radar Altimeters.  Radar altimeters will remain set at en route altitude setting until  the  slowdown.  Once  the  slowdown  is  initiated,  the  radar  altimeters  may  be  reset IAW the flight manual. 16.12.4.2.  Flap  Settings.  Ensure  100  percent  flaps  are  set  prior  to  reaching  threshold speed (If 100 percent flap setting used). 16.12.5.  Descent.    Do  not  descend  below  300  feet  AGL  until  the  LZ  environment  is identified  visually  and  confirmed  by  both  pilots.    WARNING:  In  no  case  will  a  descent below  300  feet  AGL  be  initiated  prior  to  2  NM  to  touchdown.  This  would  cause  the glideslope to be too shallow. 16.12.5.1.  Landing lights. Depending on aircraft configuration, flight engineer or copilot will extend/turn on the IR or overt landing and taxi lights.  At the discretion of the aircraft commander, landing lights may be extended when the Landing Light Panel call is made during  the  SLOWDOWN/BEFORE  LANDING  Checklist  but  left  off  until  the navigator’s “200” foot call. 16.12.5.2.  The navigator will call 100, 50, 25 and 10 feet above touchdown. 16.12.6.  Go-Around  and  Departure  Procedures.  When  executing  a  go-around  or  departure, the  navigator  will  call  out  passing  100,  200,  and  300  feet  AGL.  Whether  maneuvering  for another approach or proceeding with the route, plan to fly no lower than enroute LAA unless operational  requirements  dictate  other  altitudes.  During  a  go-around  initiate  the  GO AROUND Checklist.  CAUTION: Pilots are more susceptible to spatial disorientation during NVG go-arounds and departures. 16.12.6.1.  Immediate  Landing  Feasible.  If  an  immediate  visual  approach  and  landing (closed  pattern)  are  feasible,  exercise  caution  in  clearing  for  obstacles.      Maneuver  the aircraft to  be 500 feet  AGL  wings level  and configured at  approximately a 2 NM final. Care must be taken to keep the landing zone insight during this maneuver. 16.12.6.2.  Immediate Landing Not Feasible.  If an immediate approach and landing are not  feasible, maneuver the aircraft to  the  IP or next  waypoint  at or  above enroute  LAA unless operational requirements dictate other altitudes. Continue with the alternate plan. With an immediate landing not feasible, execute the AFTER TAKEOFF Checklist after the completion of the GO AROUND Checklist. 16.12.7.  Ground Operations. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   159  16.12.7.1.  See  paragraph  5.29.3  for  rapid  Infil/Exfil  ground  procedures.    Also  see AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 for amplifying guidance. 16.12.7.2.  The  ON  THE  RUNWAY  Checklist  is  automatically  initiated  when  the  pilot clears  the  ramp  and  door.  During  the  initial  Infil/Exfil  brief,  the  pilot  may  pre-brief  the opening  of  the  ramp  and  door  upon  reversing  of  the  engines.  Opening  of  the  ramp  and door initiates the ON THE RUNWAY Checklist. 16.12.8.  Overt  Landings  Following  NVG  Landings.  If  the  sortie  will  continue  with  Non-NVG  VFR  traffic  patterns,  the  COMBAT  EXIT  and  the  TOUCH  AND  GO  LANDING Checklist or the INFIL/EXFIL OPTION LANDING Checklist will be accomplished. If only a few patterns are planned, the INFIL/EXFIL OPTION  LANDING Checklist is quicker and easier  to  use.  If  many  patterns  or  instrument  work  is  planned,  the  COMBAT  EXIT  and TOUCH AND GO LANDING Checklist are appropriate. 16.12.9.  Infil/Exfil Option Landing Procedures.  Fly the pattern to be wings level on 1 NM final.    Pilots  will  call  the  zone  in  sight  as  they  turn  final  and  navigator/engineer  will  make standard altitude advisory calls on descent. For further, guidance see Section II of the flight manual.   160  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 Chapter 17 AIRDROP OPERATIONS 17.1.  Airdrop  General.  This  section  provides  guidance  for  HC-130  airdrop  operations.  It provides parameters used to employ the techniques and procedures of AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. 17.2.  Airdrop Kits.  The loadmaster will ensure enough equipment is included to satisfy load or mission  requirements.  Minimum  contents  of  airdrop  kits  will  include  cloth-backed  pressure sensitive  tape,  masking  tape,  1/2-inch  tubular  nylon  cord,  550  cord,  5  cord,  80-pound  cotton webbing, two G-14 clevises, and adjustable wrench. 17.3.  Verification of Load Information.  The navigator will verify the actual number and type of parachutes, load weights, sequence of delivery, and position of loads in the aircraft agree with planned CARP data. Recalculate CARPs when required. If an individual load has a different type or number of parachutes from other loads, compute a CARP for each load to ensure all loads will land on the DZ. Base drop altitude on the item requiring the highest drop altitude. 17.4.  Marking  Airdrop  Loads.  The  navigator  will  mark  call  sign  and  date  on  all  equipment, containers,  and  standard  airdrop  training  bundles  (SATBs).  Mark  equipment  loads  by  order  of exit  if  more  than  one  load  is  dropped  on  the  same  pass.  EXCEPTION:  If  more  than  one  CDS bundle is dropped on the same pass, mark only the first container out. 17.5.  Airdrop  Altitudes  and  Airspeeds.  See  AFI  11-231,  Computer  Air  Release  Point Procedures, for specific airdrop altitudes and airspeeds. 17.5.1.  Except  for  parabundle,  MA-1  kits,  free  fall,  and  LCLA  equipment  airdrops,  the primary  altitude  reference  should  be  the  planned  MSL  drop  altitude  based  on  the  most accurate altimeter setting available. It is critical to cross-check the radar altimeter against the MSL altitude during the run-in. 17.5.2.  The aircraft must be level at drop altitude and on drop airspeed by green light time. Slowdown  during  personnel  drops  should  be  planned  to  allow  jumpmaster  access  to paratroop doors NLT 1-minute before TOT (2-minutes for jumpmaster directed drops). 17.6.  Drop Zone Types and Minimum Drop Zones Size.  Refer to AFI 13-217. 17.7.  Drop Zone Markings.  Plan and coordinate DZ markings according to AFI 13-217. 17.8.  Airdrop Weather Minimums  and Wind Restrictions.  Comply with published AFI 11-202V3  and  FLIP  VFR  weather  minimums  for  visual  airdrops.  For  non-CONUS  VFR  airdrops, comply with host nation VFR criteria if more restrictive than AFI 11-202V3. 17.9.  Airdrop wind limitations.  Refer to AFI 13-217. 17.10.  Minimum Aircraft Equipment Required for Airdrop Operations.  See Table 15.3 17.11.  Airdrop  Communications  Procedures.  IAW  AFI  13-217.    For  training  operations, radio silence procedures will be coordinated prior to mission execution. 17.12.  Airdrop  Checklists.  Amplified  tactical  checklists  are  located  in  Attachment  2.  Amplified search and rescue checklist are located in Attachment 3.  Abbreviated checklists are AFI  11-2HC-130V3,  CL-1  and  CL-2.  Checklists  may  be  compressed  or  completed  early  if mission  requirements  dictate.  Normally,  all  items  of  the  preceding  checklist  are  to  be AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   161  accomplished prior to initiating the next checklist. Avoid the use of the word "Green" or "light" after initiation of the SLOWDOWN checklist until arriving at the release point. 17.13.  Airdrop Restrictions. 17.13.1.  Joint Airdrop Inspection Records. Unless exempted by AFJI 13-210, Joint Airdrop Inspection  Records,  Malfunction  Investigations,  and  Activity  Reporting,  MAJCOM supplements  or  waivers,  a  DD  Form  1748,  Joint  Airdrop  Inspection  Record,  will  be accomplished  prior  to  all  equipment  airdrops.  Completion,  retention,  and  disposition  of  the form(s) will be in accordance with AFJI 13-210, as supplemented. A-7A and A-21 containers rigged as door bundles do not require inspections.  NOTE: Equipment not rigged IAW 13C-series TOs, Army  Field  Manuals,  or Joint Special Operations Command  (JSOC) 350-series manuals  require  a  waiver  from  U.S.  Army  Quartermaster,  Ft  Lee,  VA.    Channel  waiver requests  through  HQ  ACC/A3TV.  EXCEPTION:  Waivers  are  not  required  for  resupply, parabundles, and equipment described in this volume. 17.13.2.  Drop  Zone  Surveys.    The  pilot  and  navigator  will  review  the  DZ  survey  during mission  planning  (T-1).  CAUTION:    Airdrops  at  high-elevation  drop  zones  (those  above 5,000 feet in density altitude) create a greater risk for personnel injury due to higher opening shock  and  increased  rates  of  descent,  especially  during  static  line  personnel  airdrops.    A thorough  risk  assessment  must  be  made  before  such  operations  since  injury  rates  of  up  to four  times  those  expected  for  similar  DZ  operations  near  sea  level  can  occur  under  these conditions. 17.13.3.  Airdrops will be conducted with a minimum of 1 minute separation. (T-1) 17.13.4.  Minimum  En  Route  Flight  Time.  Minimum  en  route  flight  time  from  takeoff  to time  over  release  point,  for  drops,  will  be  sufficient  to  safely  accomplish  all  required checklists. For airdrops involving personnel,  en  route time of less than 25 minutes must be approved by the jumpmaster. 17.13.5.  Ballistic  Requirements.  Crews  will  not  make  airdrops  using  parachutes  for  which AFI  11-231  does  not  list  ballistics  unless  the  user  provides  approved  ballistic  data  or  K factor.  HQ  ACC/A3J,  Aeronautical  Systems  Division  or  US  Army  Soldier's  System  Center Natick  (ASD/ENFC),  will  approve  the  ballistics or  K  factor.  This  does  not  apply  to  formal test missions where the purpose of the test is to derive ballistic data for a specific load. (T-1) 17.13.6.  Aircraft Configuration. 17.13.6.1.  The  SCNS  Airdrop/Troop  Jump  Computer-Manual  Select  Switch  will  be  set to AD/TJ manual for all airdrop operations. 17.13.6.2.  The  aircraft  will  not  be  configured  where  the  cargo  ramp  and  door  and  the paratroop  door(s)  are  open  at  the  same  time.  (T-1)  EXCEPTION:    Authorized loadmaster-directed  airdrops  of  bundles  off  the  ramp,  to  include  trial-line  drops,  while spotting from a single open paratroop door IAW paragraph 17.36 17.13.6.3.  If  an  air  deflector  door  cannot  be  opened,  its  respective  paratroop  door  will not be used. (T-1) 17.13.6.4.  If the aircraft is configured with an operational static line retriever, static line personnel  drops  are  authorized.  WARNING:  Parachutists  using  static  line  deployed parachutes will not jump from airplanes without an operational static line retriever.   162  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 17.13.6.5.  A maximum of ten static lines may be retrieved manually per paratroop door. A  maximum  of  20  static  lines  per  cable  may  be  retrieved  with  a  static  line  retriever winch. 17.14.  Safety  Devices.  (T-1)  Loadmasters will wear a restraint harness/parachute, helmet,  and eye protection when performing duties near an open exit in flight. Helmet and eye protection will be worn IAW Chapter 6. Fit the restraint harness and adjust the lifeline prior to flight. 17.14.1.  Connect and adjust the lifeline to a floor tie-down ring that will preclude the wearer from exiting the aircraft. 17.14.2.  Restraint harness lifelines may be attached to an unused anchor cable provided no static  lines  are  attached  and  an  anchor  cable  stop  is  positioned  and  taped  at  FS  737.    The center  anchor  cable  support  may  be  used  in  lieu  of  the  stop  if  lowered.    Do  not  use  this configuration(s)  if  both  paratroop  doors  are  open  at  the  same  time.    Instead,  connect  and adjust the lifeline to a floor tie-down ring that would preclude the wearer from exiting either exit. 17.14.3.  As required, disconnect the hook, roll and secure the lifeline to the restraint harness after the lifeline has been adjusted. 17.14.4.  Connect the lifeline when at, or anticipating movement aft of, FS 677. 17.14.5.  If using the personnel restraint system (shuttle system), connect to the side opposite the  paratroop  door  used  for  airdrop.    If  both  paratroop  doors  are  to  be  opened,  connect  to both sides.  For ramp and door airdrops, move the shuttle aft of the A-frame after the ramp and  door  are  in  the  ADS  position.    Move  shuttle  forward  of  the  A-frame  and  pin  before closing the ramp and door. 17.14.6.  The  onboard  safety  personnel  will  normally  provide  their  own  parachute. Alternately, at their discretion, they may use a restraint harness. Other personnel required to be  mobile  in  the  cargo  compartment,  as  determined  by  the  aircraft  commander,  will  be provided a restraint harness. EXCEPTION: Flight examiner loadmasters are exempted from this requirement provided they are not performing primary or backup loadmaster duties and will not be moving aft of FS 677. If either of these conditions is not met, a restraint harness is required.    NOTE:  Do  not  use  the  flight  deck  restraint  harness  for  airdrops.    NOTE:  For actual combat missions, wear a restraint harness for drops below 1000 feet AGL. For drops at or above 1000 feet AGL, parachute wear is recommended. 17.15.  Methods  of  Aerial  Delivery.  (T-1)  The  following  are  approved  methods  of  aerial delivery: 17.15.1.  Computed  Air  Release  Point  (CARP)  Aerial  Delivery.  This  a  visual  airdrop.    The computed  air  release  point  (CARP)  is  a  mathematical  computation  based  on  average parachute ballistics and dead reckoning principles. After computing the CARP solution, the navigator  plots  it  on  an  appropriately  scaled  chart,  sketch,  diagram,  or  aerial  photograph. Detailed  instructions  for  CARP  computations  and  depictions  are  contained  in  AFI  11-231.  NOTE:  Accurate  visual  positioning  of  the  aircraft  over  the  release  point  is  the  major difficulty  of  the  CARP  system.  Make  corrections  to  the  aircraft  track  as  far  out  from  the CARP  as  possible  to  minimize  this  deficiency.  To  achieve  desired  drop  accuracy,  maintain the track during the final approach to the CARP and throughout the drop (green light) time. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   163  17.15.2.  Pilot/Loadmaster  directed  airdrops.  Pilot  and  loadmasters  may  direct  certain specialized rescue equipment and free fall equipment deliveries IAW paragraphs 17.36 and 17.37 17.15.3.  Ground Marked Release System (GMRS).  Airdrops may be made using the visual ground  marked  release  system  (GMRS).  In  this  system,  supported  ground  forces  are responsible for computing a release point and providing ground markings (panels or lights). The  airdrop  will  be  made  directly  over  this  marker  or  abeam  a  flank  marker  as  determined during joint planning. Aircrew procedures are the same as those employed during a standard drop  except  that  a  pilot  may  assume  the  responsibility  for  calling  "5  Seconds"  and  "Green Light." The navigator will compute an in-flight CARP to predict the approximate location of the release point and facilitate initial line-up during the run-in to the DZ. See AFI 13-217 for markings.    NOTE:  The  user  assumes  responsibility  for  airdrop  accuracy  during  GMRS drops. 17.15.4.  Verbally  Initiated  Release  System  (VIRS).  VIRS  is  an  airdrop  method  by  which ground personnel provide verbal steering guidance to an aircraft and call the release when the aircraft arrives over a predetermined point on the  ground. VIRS will only  be performed by qualified and properly trained personnel IAW AFI 13-217. When this option is selected: 17.15.4.1.  The ground party will compute the release point. 17.15.4.2.  The  ground  party  will  position  on  the  intended  release  point,  provide  the aircrew  with  verbal  steering  guidance  and  call  the  release  when  the  aircraft  reaches  the release point. 17.15.4.3.  The ground party should use the terminology in Table 17.1 17.15.4.4.  The  authentication  procedures  to  be  employed  will  be  briefed  prior  to  the mission.  The  procedure  should  be  as  simple  and  short  as  possible  so  as  not  to  interfere with the approach to the DZ. Based on the limitations of radio equipment and terrain, a point  will  be  identified  as  far  out  on  the  approach  as  possible  where  contact  should  be first attempted for authentication. 17.15.4.5.  The ground party must maintain positive visual contact with the aircraft at all times during the inbound approach. If, in a training situation, doubt exists that the airdrop can be safely executed, or if the DZ cannot be positively identified by the aircrew, a no drop will be called by either the ground party or the aircrew. Table 17.1.  Standard Ground Party Voice Terminology for VIRS. Jumpmaster Calls Explanation “Turn Left” or “Right” Directs  approximately  a  half  standard  rate  turn  unless specified otherwise. “Stop Turn” Self-explanatory “Standby”  [Note 1] Indicates  approximately  five  seconds  prior  to  the release point   164  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 “Execute,  Execute,  Execute”    [Note 2] Directs release of the load NOTES:  (1) Upon hearing the term "Standby", the navigator will state "5 Seconds" on the interphone.  (2) On the first "Execute," the navigator will state "Green Light."  17.15.5.  Jumpmaster  Directed  (JMD)  Airdrops.  JMD  airdrops  require  OG/CC  or  higher approval. EXCEPTION: Unilateral PJ airdrops for continuation training.  These drops may be performed by qualified AF or sister service jumpmasters (or trainees under the supervision of qualified personnel), may direct the aircraft to a release point and determine the exit point in accordance with the following restrictions and procedures: 17.15.5.1.  JMD  airdrops  will  be  conducted  using  the  SEARCH  AND  RESCUE Checklists. 17.15.5.2.  Airdrop  personnel  in  VMC  only.    NOTE:    For  JMD  airdrops  of  pararescue personnel  and  ATV/RAMZ  packages,  crews  will  use  SEARCH  AND  RESCUE DEPLOYMENT Checklists and either a Fixed, Moving, or Crosswind Target Pattern for deployment. 17.15.5.3.  The  jumpmaster’s  parent  service/user  accepts  all  responsibility  for  the accuracy of the drop, plus any potential injuries/damage to equipment. 17.15.5.4.  In-flight visual signals, verbal signals, and interphone procedures between the jumpmaster, loadmaster, and pilot will be coordinated prior to takeoff. 17.15.5.5.  HALO and HAHO operations may be conducted using JMD procedures. 17.15.5.6.  Personnel will not exit the aircraft unless the green light is illuminated. 17.15.5.7.  The navigators will still calculate a CARP or HARP for each drop to back up the  computations  and  in-flight  directions  given  by  the  jumpmaster.  Prior  to  flight,  the aircrew and the jumpmaster will compare predicted release points, resolve any significant differences,  and  agree to a planned slowdown point or time. Navigators  will update the jumpmaster in-flight on actual wind information and any changes to the crew’s preflight CARP/HARP location. 17.15.5.8.  Standard  Voice  Terminology.  When  the  jumpmaster  provides  assistance  on final approach, use the standard voice terminology in Table 17.2 Table 17.2.  Standard Voice Terminology for JMD. Jumpmaster Calls Explanation "Steady" Present course is satisfactory AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   165  "Right" “Left” Change direction to the right 5 degrees Change direction to the left 5 degrees “Right or Left __ Degrees” Change  direction  as  indicated).  This  direction  will  be utilized when directional changes in excess of 5 degrees are desired. "No Drop" "Load Clear" No Drop will be called for unsafe or unknown conditions or unsatisfactory positioning over the target Jumpers  or  cargo  bundles  have  cleared  the  aircraft  and  the pilot  is  clear  to  make  a  turn  to  begin  the  next  pass  and/or observe results of the drop just accomplished 17.15.5.8.1.  Hand  Signals.  The  jumpmaster  may  use  the  following  hand  signals  to relay course corrections through the safety man: Thumb left/right, indicating 5-degree correction; and palm open, fingers pointed toward the cockpit, indicating steady. 17.15.5.9.  Deployment Procedures. 17.15.5.9.1.  No  less  than  2  minutes  out  from  the  release  point,  the  loadmaster  will allow  the  jumpmaster  access  to  the  door  to  begin  the  spotting  procedures.  Jumpmaster duties can be performed from any position in either paratroop door or the ramp  and  door;  however,  it  is  recommended  that  the  jumpmaster  use  the  right  door for right-hand patterns and the left door for left-hand patterns.  The jumpmaster, when wearing  a  parachute,  will  connect  the  static  line  to  the  anchor  cable  designated  for use.  When wearing an adjusted restraint harness, the jumpmaster will connect to the personnel restraint system or to a tie-down ring that would preclude the wearer from exiting  the  aircraft.    The  jumpmaster  visually  relays  steering  signals  to  the loadmaster,  who  verbally  relays  this  information  to  the  pilot.    WARNING:    The paratroop(s) door and the cargo ramp and door will not be opened at the same time.  EXCEPTION:  Authorized loadmaster-directed airdrops of bundles off the ramp, to include  trial-line  drops,  while  spotting  from  a  single  open  paratroop  door  IAW paragraph 17.36 17.15.5.9.2.  The pilot will make a "Crew, One-Minute Warning" call, at which time the loadmaster/jumpmaster will announce "Safety Checks Complete." The loadmaster is responsible for accomplishing all other appropriate checklists, overall safety in the cargo compartment, monitoring static lines, etc. 17.15.5.9.3.  Once  safety  checks  are  complete,  and  the  pilot  determines  that  all conditions are favorable for deployment upon reaching the planned/desired exit point, the pilot states "Clear To Jump" and the PM will turn on the green light.  Jumpers will exit the aircraft upon reaching the jumpmasters identified release point.  NOTE: The aircrew may turn on the green light once the drop zone has been positively identified, but  no  earlier  than  1  minute  prior  to  the  navigators  release  point  for  free  fall operations,  or  30  seconds  for  static  line  operations.  If  at  any  time  exit  of  jumpers   166  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 becomes  unsafe  (aircraft  emergency  or  similar  circumstances),  the  aircrew  will  turn on  the  red  light  and  the  loadmaster  will  direct  the  jumpmaster  to  stop  remaining parachutists. 17.15.5.10.  After all jumpers have exited; the loadmaster will call “Load Clear”. At this point the PM will turn on the red light. 17.15.5.11.  Mixed  Procedures.  JMD  releases  will  not  be  mixed  with  any  other  type  of airdrop  method.  When  JMD  drop  procedures  are  used,  the  crew  will  follow  the jumpmaster’s instructions, while adhering to normal safety concerns. 17.15.6.  Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS). 17.15.6.1.  Guided  and  Improved  airdrop  operations  are  conducted  using  the  JPADS Mission  Support  Equipment  (MSE),  UHF  Dropsonde  Receiver  Subsystem  (UHF-DRS), GPS Retransmit System (GPS-RTS), JPADS mission planning laptop and software. 17.15.6.1.1.  Guided  operations  are  conducted  using  steerable  chutes  with Autonomous Guidance Units (AGUs). 17.15.6.1.2.  Improved  operations  are  conventional  ballistic  airdrops  (e.g.  I-CDS/I-CRL)  with  non-steerable  chutes  using  the  JPADS  MSE,  mission  planning  laptop, software and dropsondes (as required) to calculate an improved CARP. 17.15.6.2.  Collateral Damage Assessment (CDA): Units must perform a full CDA prior to all JPADS Guided and Improved airdrops. See AFI 13-217 for requirements. 17.15.6.3.  The  PADS  operator  (PO)  or  mission  planner  is  required  to  provide  JPADS mission  planning  laptop  derived  CARP(s)  for  each  airdrop  pass  and  a  completed  CDA prior to airdrop mission execution.  Both pilots will review preflight CARP(s) and CDA for each respective airdrop. 17.15.6.4.  Dropsondes are not required for drops, however if they are not used a current Air  Force  Weather  Agency  (AFWA)  4-D  wind  model  should  be  loaded  in  the  mission planner. 17.15.6.5.  AFWA 4-D weather model should be uploaded into JPADS mission planning laptop and checked by the PO/mission planner before proceeding to the aircraft. 17.15.6.6.  Rigging.  If  dropping  two  or  more  bundles  rigged  for  Guided  deployment, intermediate gates made of type VIII nylon will be rigged on all CDS bundles and will be manually  cut.  Intermediate  gates  are  used  to  ensure  a  3-second  separation  between bundles.  Multiple  bundles  will  be  secured  for  forward  restraint  against  a  buffer  stop assembly  or  alternate  forward  barrier.    Multiple  CRL  bundles  will  be  cut  individually when directed by the navigator. 17.15.6.6.1.  For  single  stick  Guided  drops,  all  intermediate  gates  will  be  manually cut by the loadmaster. 17.15.6.6.2.  Double stick Guided drops are not authorized. 17.15.6.7.  Guided/Improved Airdrop Limitations and Restrictions. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   167  17.15.6.7.1.  Wind  Limits.  Wind for  dropsonde operations, 18 knots for JPADS 2K/10K and as published in AFI 13-217 for all other parachutes. limitations  are  unrestricted 17.15.6.7.2.  DZ  Size.  DZ  size  criteria  for  Guided  and  Improved  drops  during contingency  operations  is  at  the  discretion  of  the  user.  AFI  13-217  DZ  size restrictions apply during training. 17.15.6.7.3.  Guidance Footprint Locations. During training operations a DZ, CARP, chute  failure  footprint  and  guidance  failure  footprint  will  be  located  within  a restricted airspace and on military owned property. If winds force the CARP outside of  restricted  airspace  additional  coordination  with  ATC  is  required  prior  to  airdrop operations.  This  includes  coordination  with  the  ATC  agency,  filing  a  Notices  to Airmen (NOTAM), and ensuring airspace is clear for the entire guided system‘s flight profile from the drop altitude to the ground. [See AFI 13-217] 17.15.6.7.4.  During training operations the entire 1-sigma (63%)  Improved  success footprint will be located within the surveyed DZ boundaries. 17.15.6.7.5.  For  Guided  deployments,  recommended  drop  altitude  is  no  lower  than 6000 feet AGL.  Packages deployed at lower altitudes do not have sufficient altitude to correct for any errors in the deployment. The additional altitude allows the package to  correct  for  slow  exit  rolls,  changes  in  wind  over  the  drop  area  etc.  The  lowest  a parafoil system may be deployed is 3500 AGL. 17.15.6.7.6.  IMC/VMC  day/night  drops  are  authorized  for  contingency  operations. CONUS training operations are required to comply with FAR 105 restrictions.  Drops conducted thru or originating from IMC are only authorized from within or above an active  restricted  area.  Before  conducting  IMC  drops,  check  with  the  controlling agency for additional local restrictions. CAUTION:  Guided parachutes systems will not be dropped through severe turbulence or severe icing. 17.15.6.8.  Aircrew Procedure. 17.15.6.8.1.  JPADS AGU MILGPS Procedure. For training missions with Air Force JPADS  AGUs,  aircrew  will  check  out  the  MILGPS  from  the  tactics  office.  Upon mission completion and prior to removing the MILGPS enclosure, power up the AGU and  accomplish  the  Recovery  Mission  Duration  Zeroization  (RMDZ)  function. Zeroize prior to removal by pushing, for three seconds, the zeroize button located on the front panel of the MILGPS enclosure. NOTE: Keying and unkeying requires the MILGPS to be installed in a powered ON AGU. The AGU LCD screen should update within  20  seconds  and  should  read  MILGPS  Keyed  or  Unkeyed.  Once  complete power  OFF  the  AGU.  The  PO  will  remove  and  return  the  enclosure  to  the  Unit‘s Tactics Office. 17.15.6.8.2.  Jettison  of  JPADS  AGU  with  MILGPS.  Instances  of jettison, unauthorized access, tampering, theft, or loss of the JPADS MILGPS enclosure must be  reported  to  the  GPS  Controlling  Authority  (CA).  Each  report  shall  include  the JPADS  MILGPS  serial  number  and  Selective  Availability  Anti-Spoofing  Module (SAASM) GPS serial number of the missing item and must state whether the system was keyed or unkeyed. US Army Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM   168  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 FSS) will relay such jettison to the GPS CA.  NOTE: Time permitting; the LM with concurrence from the PO will remove the MILGPS enclosure from the AGU prior to load jettison. (T-1) 17.15.6.8.3.  After  the  JPADS  mission  planning  computer  produces  a  CARP,  the navigator will entered it into the SCNS. The PM or AMSS will verify the CARP and all airdrop parameters are entered correctly into the navigation system. 17.15.6.8.4.  Combination Drops.  The limiting factor for combination airdrops is the jumper.  When  computing  the  release  point,  the  navigators  should  use  75%  of  the maximum personnel glide distance to ensure all personnel could reach the drop zone. Typically  parafoil  systems  have  a  greater  glide  distance  and  should  easily  make  the drop  zone  during  combination  airdrops  using  the  more  restrictive  personnel  release point. 17.15.6.8.5.  Dropsonde airdrops will be conducted using zero percent flaps, between 170  and  180  KIAS,  using  only  the  cargo  door.    This  configuration  will  prevent  the dropsonde from striking the tail of the aircraft.  Loadmasters will open the cargo door from  the  aft  control  panel  for  dropsonde  airdrops.  Loadmasters  will  release  the dropsonde  from  the  corner  of  the  cargo  ramp,  which  will  be  in  the  fully  closed position.  Upon  hearing  and  seeing  “Green  Light”,  release  the  dropsonde  at  a  45-degree angle away from the corner of the ramp. 17.15.6.8.6.  During  training  for  Improved  deployments,  a  GPS  Figure  of  Merit (FOM)  of  3  or  less  is  required.    EXCEPTION:    MCAD  certified  navigators  may verify system accuracy using offset aimpoints if GPS FOM is greater than 3. 17.15.6.8.7.  For  Guided  operations,  a  GPS  Figure  of  Merit  (FOM)  3  or  less  is required from the 1 minute warning until “Green Light”.  A “No Drop” will be called if these conditions are not met. 17.15.6.8.8.  The  AGU  should  be  set  to  "AUTOLAND"  and  verified  prior  to  all deployments.  The packages will not flare during landing unless the AGU is set to the “AUTOLAND”  position.    EXCEPTION:    For  combination,  AGUs  will  be  set  as required to meet jumpers mission requirements. 17.15.7.  Mission Computer Airdrops. Certified crews are authorized to make airdrops using MCAD procedures in VMC or IMC.  See AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 for additional information. 17.15.7.1.  Navigators will use a minimum of two (2) Offset Aim Points (OAPs) on the run-in  (IP  to  1-Minute  warning)  to  verify  SCNS  course.    OAPs  should  be  determined during mission planning and located no more than 6 miles/no less than 1 mile off course centerline.  Run-in OAPs will be briefed during the tactical mission brief. 17.15.7.2.  Minimum  drop  altitude  for  VMC  operations  is  IAW  AFI  11-231.  Minimum IFR drop 500 feet above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstruction, terrain feature,  or  spot  elevation),  or  400  feet  plus  one  contour  interval  above  the  highest depicted terrain  contour, whichever is  highest,  within  3 nautical  miles either side of the run-in  centerline  from  DZ  entry  point  to  DZ  exit  point  or  as  specified  in  AFI  11-231, whichever is higher. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   169  17.15.7.3.  Chart  Annotations.    When  IFR  corridor  procedures  are  used,  the  DZ  Entry point, DZ Exit Point, and Instrument Meteorological Conditions Stabilization Point will be annotated on charts at the required distance to go on the run in. The start climb point required  to  meet  DZ  Exit  Point  altitude  requirements  will  be  annotated  at  the  required distance to go where the start climb is to be initiated. 17.15.7.4.  Aircrew Procedures. 17.15.7.4.1.  During the  TWENTY MINUTE Checklist  'DZ Data' call, the navigator and the PM will confirm OAP and DZ information in SCNS using SCNS/OAP Card depicted at Figure 17.1 [items asterisked will be confirmed].  NOTE:  Units may use locally developed cards as long as all the information from Figure 17.1 is replicated.  Locally approved cards will be approved by the OG/CC. 17.15.7.4.2.  The  PM  will  inform  the  pilot  flying  when  1,000  ft  and  100  ft  above segmented IFR corridor altitudes and/or IFR drop altitude. 17.15.7.4.3.  Initiate descent from minimum IFR altitude at the DZ  Entry Point. IFR drop  altitude.  When  operating  under  Federal  Aviation  Administration  exemption 4371C, the DZ entry point is a maximum of 40 NM prior to the DZ exit point. 17.15.7.4.4.  The IFR corridor [DZ entry point to DZ Exit Point] may be segmented IAW with AFTTP 3-3.HC-130  guidance. 17.15.7.4.5.  Calculate  the  DZ  exit  point  based  upon  three-engine  performance  at airdrop  gross  weight.  This  point  will  be  planned  no  less  than  4  NMs  track  distance beyond the DZ trailing edge 17.15.7.4.6.  Run-in  course  update  procedures  using  OAPs  and  the  APN-241  Radar are IAW T.O. 1C-130-1-4. 17.15.7.5.  Aircrew Procedure IP Inbound. 17.15.7.5.1.  After  the  initial  point  (IP),  the  navigator  should  inform  the  pilot  when they are “cleared to chase” the bar, based on the accuracy of their SCNS solution. The pilot  is  then  cleared  to  maintain  SCNS  centerline.  Centerline  or  “on  the  bar”  is considered within 25 yards of SCNS crosstrack (XTRK). 17.15.7.5.2.  A  cadence  should  also  begin  at  this  time,  which  should  include  the following items:  cross track (XTRK), Trend or track angle error (TKE),  Drift (based on pilot  preference), and advisory  calls (Time/distance to next  event).   The cadence should be continuous from the IP through the escape every 15 to 30 seconds based on how well the PF is maintaining centerline. 17.15.7.5.3.  Throughout  the  run-in  the  navigator  should  inform  the  pilot  when  they are  updating  SCNS  position  via  a  “hot”  cursor,  switching  targets,  or  updating  the ballistic winds. Updating the ballistic winds should be done no later than the 1-minute warning to avoid large course corrections close to the drop zone. 17.15.7.5.4.  DZ Acquisition.   If the pilots  can see visual  ground references and  DZ markings are used, both pilots and navigator will confirm the DZ in sight prior to the "5 seconds" call.   170  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 17.15.7.5.5.  Safety  Box.    If  the  pilots  can  see  visual  ground  references  the  visual “safety  box”  is  primary.    If  the  PM  cannot  see  the  ground  or  identify  the  visual “safety box” use prebriefed SCNS XTRK and safe parameters. Figure 17.1.  SCNS/OAP Card.

Navigating  to  the  Release  Point.  (T-1)  The  following  procedures  below  are  based  on using  tactical  airdrop  checklist  using  a  navigator  directed  CARP/HARP  delivery  method.  Release  point  procedures  will  differ  if  using  VIRS,  GMRS,  or  JMD  delivery  methods  or SEARCH  AND  RESCUE  DEPLOYMENT  Checklist  procedures.    For  additional  guidance  on High Altitude Airdrops see paragraphs 17.26 and 17.27 AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   171  17.16.1.  Planning.  Beginning with the DZ, memorize PI location, DZ dimensions, 5 second warning, and prominent  DZ features.  Plan  at  least  two (preferably three) update points for the run-in to ensure proper DZ alignment.  The crew will determine if a level, ascending or descending slowdown is appropriate for the planned run-in. 17.16.2.  The navigator performing the airdrop will prepare an AF IMT Form 4123, Airdrop Card, or OGV-approved equivalent, for each type drop planned 17.16.3.  Pilot and Navigator Release Point Procedures.  The navigator and pilot will position the aircraft upwind to the release point using all available means to include but not limited to SCNS and visual techniques and the following pilot/navigator procedures: 17.16.3.1.  Airspeed  adjustments  should  be  completed  prior  to  the  IP  or  slowdown, whichever occurs first. 17.16.3.2.  If the IP is visible from a distance and time control permits, overfly the IP on run-in  heading.  Otherwise,  fly  a  radius  of  turn  leg  to  the  DZ.  If  required,  update navigation equipment at the IP. 17.16.3.3.  After departing the IP, the PM the aircraft assists the navigator in maintaining the desired track inbound by confirming aircraft position with the planned run-in update points.  The  pilot  flying  the  aircraft  will  fly  SCNS  inbound  to  the  release  point  or  will position the aircraft upwind using visual techniques. 17.16.3.4.  The navigator will use the SCNS (for MCAD) to position the aircraft upwind to  the  release  point.    The  navigator  provides  headings  that  will  position  the  aircraft  the required  distance  upwind  from  centerline  track  so  that  large  corrections  will  not  be required on the final approach to the release point. 17.16.3.5.  At slowdown, immediately double the drift used prior to slowdown and apply it to the run-in heading. This will keep the aircraft on the upwind side of the PI. 17.16.3.6.  The navigator informs the pilot of the expected drift, the heading required to parallel  the  DZ  axis,  and  confirms  the  drop  altitude  and  airspeed.    The  navigator  will update the CARP manually and will update the SCNS (as required) for mission computer airdrops  (MCAD).    A  visual  airdrop  is  defined  as  the  pilot  holding  an  offset  and  the navigator  calling  the  drop  off  the  PI  using  the  site  angle  technique  or  using  a  timing point. 17.16.3.7.  As  soon  as  the  DZ  is  visible  and  identified  by  the  pilot  and  navigator,  they jointly confirm the release point location, lateral offset, and track required. The pilot then assumes  the  responsibility  for  maintaining  this  offset  distance  and  required  track.  The navigator  will  pick  the  timing  point,  if  required,  and  control  the  time  of  "Green  Light" and  "Red  Light,"  and  continually  cross  check  the  offset  distance.    NOTE:    Both  pilots and navigator will confirm the DZ in sight prior to the "5 Seconds" call. 17.16.3.8.  During  the  final  seconds  of  the  approach  to  the  release  point,  the  PM  the aircraft  places  a  hand  near  the  jump  light  switch.  Five  seconds  prior  to  release,  the navigator will give a preparatory call of "5 Seconds." At this call, if the aircraft location is not within precoordinated parameters, a "No Drop" condition exists. (T-1) 17.16.3.9.  At  the  release  point:    The  navigator  will  state  "Green  Light".    The  PM  the aircraft will turn on the green light and verbally calls the light "On."   172  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 17.16.3.10.  During the drop: 17.16.3.10.1.  The  loadmaster  will  not  deploy  equipment  or  personnel  until  hearing and  seeing  the  green  light.  EXCEPTION:  During  manual  parachute  flare,  streamer, marker smoke, or sea-dye delivery and for rescue airdrops using the SEARCH AND RESCUE  Checklist,  the  loadmaster  may  deploy  equipment  on  the  pilot’s  verbal command. 17.16.3.10.2.  The  pilot  will  make  any  small  corrections  required  to  maintain  the track. 17.16.3.10.3.  The navigator will monitor the time to "Red Light”. 17.16.3.10.4.  The loadmaster will advise the pilot when the load is clear, and of any delay or malfunction. 17.17.  Slowdown  Procedures.  (T-1)  During  airdrop  operations,  the  pilot  will  perform  the slowdown maneuver and accomplish the SLOWDOWN Checklist at a predetermined point prior to  the release point. A computer position or prebriefed timing procedure  may be used when an easily  identifiable  geographical  point  is  not  available.  Begin  slowdown  at  a  distance commensurate  with  proficiency  of  crew,  normally  5  to  7  NM.  After  the  navigator  calls  for  the slowdown: 17.17.1.  The pilot retards the throttles toward flight idle (0-1000 inch pounds of torque). 17.17.2.  The PM or flight engineer (as briefed) lowers the flaps in 10 percent increments on speed. 17.17.3.  For  paratroop  door  drops,  the  PM  opens  the  air  deflector  doors  (if  required)  upon slowing  below  150  KIAS.    Once  air  deflector  door  are  called  “Open,”  the  loadmaster  is automatically  cleared  to  open  the  paratroop  door.  WARNING:    If  an  air  deflector  fails  to open, do not open the respective paratroop door.  Notify the pilot of the problem. 17.17.4.  For tailgate drops, the flight engineer calls "Doors" at or below 150 KIAS, as part of  the  checklist.  The  loadmaster  states  "Clear  To  Open",  followed  by  the  pilot.  The  flight engineer then opens the cargo door and ramp. 17.17.5.  For CDS airdrops, reset the flaps IAW the CDS flap setting chart in the abbreviated checklist  only.    NOTE:    The  aircraft  must  be  level  at  drop  altitude  and  airspeed  by  green light time.   EXCEPTION:  During personnel airdrops, the aircraft must be at or above drop altitude and stable not later than 1 minute out (2 minutes out for jumpmaster directed drops) to allow the jumpmaster access to the paratroop door. (T-2) 17.17.6.  Complete the SLOWDOWN Checklist and One-Minute Warning. 17.17.7.  Descending  Slowdown.  At  slowdown,  upon  reaching  140  KIAS,  descend  to  drop altitude. 17.17.8.  [For  MCAD]  At  slowdown,  do  not  initiate  descent  until  the  following  conditions are met: 17.17.8.1.  Position is positively identified and at or past the DZ entry point. 17.17.8.2.  The  aircraft  is  within  3  NMs  of  DZ  run-in  course  centerline.    WARNING: Analyze  pre-drop  gross  weight  to  determine  if  obstructions  can  be  cleared  with  one AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   173  engine inoperative.  If obstruction clearance cannot be met reduce aircraft gross weight, revise run-in and/or escape course, or increase drop altitude. 17.17.9.  Complete the aerial delivery. 17.18.  Ramp  and  Door  Operations.  (T-2)  Depending  on  the  tactical  situation,  the  pilot  may direct  ramp  and  door  opening  anytime  after  the  Six-Minute  Advisory  has  been  completed  and 150  KIAS  has  been  achieved.  After  the  ramp  and  door  are  open,  loadmasters  are  cleared  to complete their slowdown checks.  WARNING: For personnel airdrops, the pilot must be aware of paratroopers standing in the back and avoid drastic pitch or bank changes after the Six Minute Advisory. 17.19.  Aircrew No Drop Decisions.  (T-1) 17.19.1.  Prior  to  the  "One-Minute  Warning"  call,  any  crewmember  who  determines  a condition exists that could jeopardize a safe drop will notify the aircraft commander. A "No Drop" will be called at the discretion of the aircraft commander. 17.19.2.  After the "One-Minute Warning" call, any crewmember observing a condition that would jeopardize a safe drop will transmit "No Drop" on interphone. The PM, navigator and loadmaster  will  immediately  acknowledge  the  "No  Drop"  call.  The  loadmaster  will accomplish  the  applicable  no-drop  procedures  before  performing  the  COMPLETION  OF DROP Checklist. The PIC must ensure the crew is aware of what the plan is in the event of a no drop (racetrack, alternate DZ, RTB, etc.) and instruct the crew to  follow the appropriate procedures. 17.19.3.  Checklist may still be in progress after the "One-Minute Warning." Call "No Drop" if all checklists are not completed by the "5 Seconds" call. 17.19.4.  If  a  "No  Drop"  is  called  after  load  restraint  is  removed  and  a  racetrack  is  not planned, restraint will be reapplied. 17.20.  Airdrop Malfunction/Emergency Procedures.  (T-1) If a malfunction occurs during an airdrop,  the  loadmaster  will  immediately  notify  the  pilot  and  take  appropriate  action.  After  all appropriate  emergency  actions  are  completed;  accomplish  the  COMPLETION  OF  DROP Checklist.  Detailed  emergency  briefings  will  be  conducted  between  the  loadmasters,  crew,  and jumpers.  Loadmasters  will  brief  visual  and  verbal  signals  and  establish  coordinated  tasks  for their crew position prior to the first airdrop warning. 17.21.  Departure from Drop Zone (Escape).  (T-1) The navigator will call "Red Light" at the expiration  of  the  "Green  Light"  time  or  upon  hearing  the  loadmaster’s  call  of  "Load  Clear," whichever occurs first. 17.21.1.  When  the  red  light  is  turned  on,  immediately  begin  the  escape  maneuver  by tracking  flaps  if  required,  turning  to  the  departure  heading,  increase  airspeed  to  140  KIAS, and  attain  en  route  altitude.  To  facilitate  static  line  retrieval  and  preclude  entanglement,  do not exceed 140 KIAS until the static lines are retrieved. 17.21.2.  Accelerate  to  140  KIAS,  climb  or  descend  as  briefed,  and  perform  the COMPLETION  OF  DROP  Checklist.      NOTE:  During  combat,  static  lines  that  cannot  be retrieved will be cut so that doors can be closed. Close all doors, raise flaps, and accelerate to en  route  airspeed.  It  is  imperative  that  the  aircraft  be  configured  for  high  speed  evasive maneuvers.  Therefore,  after  the  static  lines  have  been  retrieved  or  cut,  the  doors  and  air   174  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 deflectors closed, and flaps raised, the remainder of the COMPLETION OF DROP Checklist may be deferred to a more convenient time. 17.22.  Multiple Passes (Racetrack).  (T-1) Multiple passes will not be made unless directed or previously agreed upon by all units involved. If multiple passes are flown, all airdrop checklists will be accomplished. Doors may remain open at the discretion of the PIC.  Checklists may be compressed  during  racetracks,  but  the  aircraft  commander  must  ensure  the  loadmaster  has adequate  time  to  complete  all  items  before  the  drop  is  initiated.  The  One  Minute  Warning  is never  compressed  and  is  always  given  on  time.  EXCEPTION:  During  pilot  directed  airdrops, the checklist may be initiated at a point commensurate with the available time and type of drop. 17.23.  Water DZs.  Water drops can be conducted on marked or unmarked DZs.  Refer to AFI 13-217 for further guidance. 17.24.  Pararescue  JMD  (PJMD)  Fixed,  Moving,  and  Crosswind  Target  Patterns.  (T-1) These  procedures  may  be  used  for  JMD  deployment  of  pararescue  personnel  and/or equipment only. 17.24.1.  Pre-Deployment  Evaluation.    In  a  permissive  environment,  evaluation  of  the landing surface and surrounding obstructions should be accomplished by observation passes. Evaluation of the weather should include existing and forecast temperatures, wind direction, precipitation,  cloud  cover,  fog,  visibility,  etc.  Wind  velocity  evaluation  will  include consideration  of  direction,  gusts,  and  wind  shear.  The  crew  should  keep  the  jumpmaster advised of current mean altitude winds. The presence of rocks or stumps may impose a lower maximum  velocity  while  the  presence  of  trees,  unfrozen  tundra,  or  soft  snow  might  permit safe jumping at higher velocities. 17.24.2.  General.  Pararescuemen  wearing  static  line  parachutes  will  normally  deploy through  a  single  paratroop  door  or  off  the  cargo  ramp  (tailgate).  The  parachute  static  lines will be connected to the anchor cable on the same side the static line retriever is installed. No more  than  20  parachutists  may  exit  on  a  single  pass  using  the  long  cable  either  from  the paratroop  door  or  off  the  ramp.  Streamer/spotter  chutes  will  be  used  prior  to  JMD deployments  using  Pararescue  Fixed  Target,  Moving  Target,  or  Crosswind  Target deployment patterns. 17.24.2.1.  Streamers are 20-foot lengths of crepe paper weighted on one end. The spotter chute used is the standard J-1 (12 foot diameter) wind drift determination parachute. The spotter chute weight can be provided by the PJ or a MK-6 Mod 3 smoke. When the MK-6 Mod 3 is used, the jumpmaster will signal the safetyman/loadmaster when to launch the smoke.  Immediately  upon  receiving the  safetyman/loadmaster  will simultaneously activate and launch the smoke. the  signal, 17.24.2.2.  The  safetyman/loadmaster  will  assist  the  jumpmaster  in  launching  the streamer/spotter  chute  and  will  remain  at  the  door  during  pararescue  deployments.  The jumpmaster, pilot, and navigator will confirm the exit point prior to release.  NOTE:  For low  altitude  JMD  PJ  drops,  a  navigator’s  CARP  is  not  required  when  using streamers/spotter chutes.  WARNING: During paratroop door static line personnel drops, personnel will not position themselves directly under the center anchor cable supports (A-frame, FS 737). AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   175  17.24.3.  Deployment Pattern. The normal flight pattern will be a racetrack pattern, with the final approach from spotting device to target.  NOTE: See AFI 11-231 for detailed guidance on Pararescue Fixed Target, Moving Target, or Crosswind Target deployment patterns. 17.24.3.1.  The  pattern  will  be  large  enough  to  allow  for  heading  corrections  on  final approach. The crosswind leg will be made as soon as possible after the spotting device or jumper clears the aircraft. It is important that the target area remain in sight at all times. 17.24.3.2.  The aircraft will be maneuvered at 150 KIAS or below in a racetrack pattern. 17.24.3.3.  Aircraft Configuration. 17.24.3.3.1.  Deployment airspeed is 125 KIAS. 17.24.3.3.2.  Set  flaps  to  50%  below  140,000  lbs  and  70%  at  or  above  140,000  lbs. NOTE:  Pararescuemen will not be deployed from aircraft with gross weights greater than 155,000 lbs. 17.24.3.4.  The  jumpmaster  must  be  kept  advised  of  the  position  of  the  aircraft  in  the pattern and the aircraft commander must be kept informed of the activities in the rear of the aircraft. 17.24.4.1.  Leave the red light on for dry passes and streamer/spotter chute patterns. 17.24.4.2.  On  final  for  live  drops,  the  pilot  will  make  a  "Crew,  One-Minute  Warning" call,  CAUTION:  (T-1)  For  the  confined  lake  or  near  shore  water  drops  of  pararescue personnel or RAMZ training, do not call "Crew, One-Minute Warning" until over water. Call  “No  Drop”  if  the  exit  point  for  the  RAMZ  will  be  over  land.    NOTE:  The deployment pattern may be flown on autopilot. 17.24.5.  Post-Deployment.  Maintain  visual  or  radio  contact  with  the  pararescue  team  and maintain surveillance of the area for possible natural or man-made hazards. After pararescue deployment, the PIC will notify the appropriate agencies to ensure required team support is provided.  Every  effort  will  be  expended  to  ensure  that  the  pararescue  team  is  covered  by rescue  aircraft  until  the  party  is  assured  of  surface  assistance.  Surface  assistance  for  land operation is not required as long as sufficient supplies are available. Prior to departure of the aircraft  from  the  incident  site,  resupply  schedules,  communication  schedules,  supply requirements, and planned actions of the pararescue team will be established by the PIC and team leader. 17.24.5.1.  Primary  and  alternate  frequencies,  schedules,  and  an  alternate  method  of communication will be established by the mission commander and will be included in the mission commander’s pre-mission brief. 17.24.5.2.  If  practicable,  the  pararescuemen  will  immediately  establish  radio  contact with the drop aircraft upon penetration of the incident site. The team leader will verify the predetermined  schedule  for  the  next  radio  contact  before  the  drop  aircraft  departs  the area. 17.24.5.3.  In the event the pararescue team fails to establish communication at the initial pre-briefed  time,  maximum  effort  will  be  made  on  the  next  check  or  the  alternate schedule until radio contact is established.   176  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 17.24.5.4.  If  communication  cannot  be  established  through  the  procedures  outlined above,  any  other  method  of  communication  may  be  used  to  relay  information  to  the rescue team. 17.25.  Pararescue Deployments to Ships.  (T-1) Many factors affect the decision to deploy PJs to ships at sea, precluding the establishment of a single procedure that will apply to all situations. In all cases, thorough preplanning and coordination with the recovery vessel is vital to a safe and successful operation. The following will provide guidelines and considerations: 17.25.1.  In sea conditions other than calm, it is essential the ship have a motorized launch in the  water  prior  to  team  deployment,  unless  the  PJ  team  deploys  with  a  Rigging  Alternate Method Zodiac watercraft.  WARNING: The aircrew will prepare an MA-1 sea rescue kit for deployment from the cargo ramp as soon as practical following an open water PJ deployment (not required for training). 17.25.2.  Positioning and maneuvering of the ship, motorized launch, and deployment of the MA-1 kit is the ship captain’s decision. When possible, the aircraft commander should advise the  ship  captain  on  positioning  and  maneuvering  prior  to  deployment.  The  crew  should determine whether the ship can remain still in the water, whether the ship will be steered into the wind or crosswind, and where the launch will be positioned. 17.25.3.  The rescue aircraft should deploy the pararescue team to the motorized launch. The launch should maintain its position during the deployment pattern.   WARNING:  The crew will make every effort to advise the ship to shut down its propellers anytime a pararescuemen is in the water alongside side it. 17.25.4.  In the case that a decision is made to deploy the team without the use of a motorized launch, it is critical that the method of boarding is verified prior to deployment. 17.26.  High  Altitude  Airdrop  Oxygen  Requirements  (T-1).  AFI  11-202V3  General  Flight Rules is the source document for oxygen requirements for unpressurized and pressurized aircraft operations  and  the  associated  time  limits.    Crewmembers  will  follow  established  MAJCOM oxygen mask requirements.  AFI 11-409, High Altitude Airdrop Mission Support Program, is the source document for high altitude airdrop oxygen, prebreathing and Physiology Technician (PT) requirements/restrictions. 17.26.1.  Only essential personnel who have accomplished appropriate physiological training described  in  AFI  11-403,  Aerospace  Physiological  Training  Program  are  permitted  on mission aircraft for airdrops above 10,000 feet MSL. 17.26.2.  A  continuous  supply  of  100  percent  oxygen  will  be  used  during  unpressurized operations  IAW  Table  17.3    EXCEPTION:    Parachutists  may  operate  without  the supplemental oxygen during unpressurized flight up to 13,000 feet MSL provided the elapsed time  above  10,000  feet  MSL  does  not  exceed  30  minutes  per  sortie.  Under  circumstances other than these, jumpers will use supplemental oxygen. 17.26.3.  All personnel will prebreathe 100 percent oxygen below 16,000 feet MSL pressure altitude or cabin altitude on any mission scheduled for an exposure at or above FL 200.  See Table  17.3  for  prebreathing  times  extracted  from  AFI  11-409.  When  the  aircraft  oxygen system  does  not  provide  sufficient  oxygen  regulators  for  all  personnel,  approved  portable oxygen  console(s)  will  be  pre-flighted  and  installed  in  the  aircraft.  The  console(s)  will AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   177  provide enough oxygen regulators for all parachutists and crewmembers not accommodated by  the  normal  aircraft  system.    NOTE:  Portable  oxygen  bottles  will  not  be  used  for  pre-breathing; the quick-don/smoke mask is emergency equipment  and is not approved for pre-breathing or operations conducted at or above FL 200. 17.26.4.  All  airdrops  above  25,000  feet  MSL  require  a  waiver  to  AFI  11-202V3  for unpressurized flight, from Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA). Table 17.3.  Prebreathing Requirements and Exposure Limits for High Altitude Operations.  Altitude Oxygen  Requirement  Pre-breathe Time (2) Maximum Exposure  Time Per Sortie (1)  Above 10,000 to 13,000 ft MSL  Above 13,000 ft MSL to FL199  FL 200 to FL 249  FL 250 to FL 299  FL 300 to FL 349   Aircrew: 100% O2  Jumpers: See AFI 11-409  100% O2  N/A  N/A  Aircrew: Unlimited  Jumpers: See AFI 11-409  Unlimited  100% O2  100% O2  100% O2  30 Min  30 Min  45 Min  110 Min  60 Min  30 Min  NOTES:   (1) Maximum exposure time per sortie is when cabin altitude reaches maximum planned altitude; extended or delayed ascent times expose everyone onboard to greater DCS risk; missions that require staggered altitude drops will use accumulative times per sortie information for mission planning. See AFI 11-409 for additional information.  (2) No more than 3 Pre-breather sorties in a 24-hour period unless otherwise restricted.    17.27.  High  Altitude  Airdrop  Procedures.  (T-1)  Airdrops  conducted  above  3,000  feet  AGL are considered high altitude drops. EXCEPTION: RAMZ airdrops at or below 3,500 feet AGL are considered low altitude drops. 17.27.1.  Cabin  differential  pressure  will  be  managed  to  have  cabin  altitude  equal  to  the ambient pressure prior to completion of the TEN-MINUTE checklist.  Depressurization will not  exceed  3,000  ft  per  minute.  NOTE:    If  any  jumpers  are  still  onboard,  ensure  the parachutes automated actuation devices are disabled prior to descending or repressurizing. 17.27.2.  A  pre-mission  HARP  solution  will  be  calculated  based  on  preflight  weather  and winds. 17.27.3.  For  all  HALO/HAHO  operations,  navigators  will  provide  the  jumpmaster  with  a magnetic course +/- 5 degrees and a distance (NM, KM, or meters) from the release point to the drop zone.   178  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 17.27.4.  Navigators  will  compare the jumpmaster’s chart and  calculations.   In-flight  changes to  the HARP location or significant wind changes will be relayed to the jumpmaster as soon as possible. location  and  calculations  with their  HARP 17.27.5.  The SCNS wind may be used to update preflight HARP winds and to determine and update the winds at altitude, provided the SCNS TAS is accurate [within 5 knots of TAS as determined by TAS check]. 17.27.6.  The  SCNS  will  be  used  to  assist  in  properly  aligning  the  aircraft  on  the  inbound course. 17.27.7.  All available radio aids may be used to assist in locating the HARP but will not be relied  on  as  the  sole  means  for  release.    NOTE:  For  HALO,  positive  identification  of  the drop zone area must be confirmed electronically or visually prior to calling the release. 17.27.8.  Low  level  flight  to  the  target  area  with  a  climb  is  most  desirable  for  HALO  or HAHO operations.  This  will enable the navigators to  obtain current winds for updating the HARP. High level flights are also possible but the HARP will have to be based on preflight winds. The release may be accomplished visually. 17.27.9.  On  all  training  and  exercise  missions,  unless  prevented  by  airspace  restrictions, update the preflight winds at each altitude used to compute the HARP. Obtain these winds as near the DZ as possible. 17.27.10.  The  aircraft  should  be  at  drop  altitude,  inbound  to  the  HARP  not  later  than  6 minutes prior to the HARP. This amount of time is necessary for the navigator to update the HARP and to position the aircraft on the correct inbound course. 17.27.11.  High  Altitude  Emergency  Procedures.  If  any  person  experiences  decompression sickness or unusual pain, the PIC will: 17.27.11.1.  Abort the mission. 17.27.11.2.  Begin descent (pressurization and descent will be determined by the type and degree of sickness or pain). 17.27.11.3.  Ensure  the  affected  person  remains  on  100  percent  oxygen  until  a  medical doctor determines the type of treatment required. 17.27.11.4.  Proceed  to  the  nearest  base/location  with  qualified  medical  assistance available. 17.27.11.5.  Advise the control agency of the emergency and request an ambulance meet the aircraft. 17.27.11.6.  Advise  attending  physician  to  call  USAF  Hyperbaric  Medicine  Division; during duty hours call DSN 554-3483 or (210) 292-3483 and after duty hours call DSN 554-5990  or  (210)  292-5990.    For  out  of  area  medical  assistance,  call  the  Divers  Alert Network  (DAN)  at  1-800-446-2671.  MAJCOM/SG  and  Wing/Unit  Safety  (SE)  will  be notified by the most expeditious manner of any physiological incident. 17.28.  Personnel Drops.  (T-1) AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   179  17.28.1.  Briefings.  The  PIC  will  ensure  all  aspects  of  personnel  airdrops  are  discussed  in detail  at  the  Pilot-Jumpmaster  and  Navigator-Jumpmaster  briefings.  Use  the  pilot-jumpmaster and navigator-jumpmaster briefing guides found in AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-1. 17.28.2.  Aircrew Procedures.  Use the PERSONNEL/EQUIPMENT AIRDROP or SEARCH AND RESCUE DEPLOYMENT Checklist as appropriate. 17.28.2.1.  Flaps.  Configuration  is  50  percent  flaps.    EXCEPTION:    CDS  combination drops or PJMD airdrops above 140,000 pounds aircraft gross weight. 17.28.2.2.  Airspeed. The jumpmaster will be briefed on the airspeed used. 17.28.2.3.  Pararescue/Jumper  Minimum  Operating  Speed.    The  flight  engineer  will compute  a  PJ  MOS  for  all  static  line  personnel  drops  and  post  this  information  on  the TOLD card. Compute data using power off stall speed with 50 percent flap setting at 30 degree bank angle plus 5 knots. 17.28.2.4.  Altitude. Pressure altitude will be used as the airdrop altitude reference. 17.28.2.5.  Exits.  Low  altitude  personnel  drops  are  normally  accomplished  from  the paratroop doors.  If the aircraft is configured with a static line retriever, static line tailgate drops  of  personnel  are  authorized.  NOTE:  Tailgate  drops  are  those  drops  during  which parachutists  exit  from  the  aircraft  ramp.  Low  altitude  tailgate  drops  are  approved  for STT,  PJ,  Air  Force  Survival  Evasion  Resistance  Escape  (SERE)  Specialists,  Army Special  Forces,  Navy  SEALS,  paratroopers  equipped  for  arctic  airdrop,  other  US  and allied  special  operations  personnel,  US  Army  Quartermaster  Center  and  School,  Yuma Proving  Ground  Airborne  Test  Force,  and  units  for  which  a  combination  drop  is  their normal method of deployment. 17.28.3.  Drop  Configuration.  The  aircrew  loadmaster  will  ensure  the  configuration  of  the aircraft anchor cables and seats are consistent with the number of personnel to be airdropped. During aircraft preflight, the loadmaster will ensure that all seats have a serviceable retaining strap attached. Fit seats without a serviceable retaining strap with a suitable length of type III nylon,  pre-measured  for  sufficient  length  to  secure  the  seat  in  a  raised  position  to  the  seat back support frame. For single pass drops, ensure that parachutists have secured all seats (as required) and no part of the seat protrudes into the aisle. On multiple passes, the number of parachutists  to  be  dropped  on  that  pass  determines  the  number  of  seats  raised.  Airborne, personnel  will  raise  and  secure  or  lower  seats  as  required  under  the  supervision  and instruction of the aircrew loadmaster.  WARNING:  During paratroop door static line drops, personnel  will  not  position  themselves  directly  under  the  center  anchor  cable  supports  (A-frame, FS 737).  Personnel in the cargo compartment during tailgate drops will not position themselves  below  the  static  line  retriever  cable  while  the  cargo  ramp  and  door  are  open.  WARNING:  Ensure all personnel  aft of FS 677 are secured to  the aircraft or have a static line connected prior to opening the ramp and door/troop door. HALO/HAHO personnel must be configured and ready to jump. 17.28.4.  Loadmaster-Jumpmaster Control. 17.28.4.1.  At completion of the SLOWDOWN  Checklist,  the loadmaster will allow the jumpmaster access  to  the paratroop door or ramp no later than (NLT) 1  minute prior to jump.   180  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 17.28.4.2.  For  jumpmaster-directed  airdrops  using  the  SEARCH  AND  RESCUE DEPLOYMENT  Checklist,  after  Pre-Deployment  checks  are  complete,  the  loadmaster will allow the jumpmaster access to paratroop door or ramp NLT 2 minutes prior to the jump. 17.28.4.3.  The  loadmaster  will  then  take  position  in  such  a  manner  as  to  provide maximum  maneuverability  for  the  jumpmaster  and  safety  personnel  to  perform  their duties, and to prevent interference with exiting jumpers. Upon seeing the red jump lights illuminate, the loadmaster will notify the jumpmaster or safety personnel of the red light condition.  The  loadmaster  will  take  no  further  action  to  stop  any  of  the  remaining parachutists. The loadmaster will count (if possible) any parachutists that exit the aircraft after  the  red  light  has  illuminated.  WARNING:  Do  not  attempt  to  physically  stop  or hinder jumpers from exiting the aircraft if jumpers continue to exit after "Red Light". 17.28.4.4.  Control  of  the  paratroop  door/cargo  ramp  will  revert  back  to  the  loadmaster after  all  parachutists  have  exited  or  remaining  parachutists  have  been  stopped  by  the jumpmaster or safety person and cleared from the paratroop door/cargo ramp area. 17.28.4.5.  For  multiple passes  (i.e.,  racetracks),  after  assuming  control  of  the  paratroop door/cargo  ramp  from  the  jumpmaster,  the  loadmaster(s)  will  maintain  control  of  the doors/cargo ramp until completion of subsequent SLOWDOWN Checklist. 17.28.5.  Aircraft  Emergency  During  Personnel  Drops.  When  an  aircraft  emergency  occurs during or after the time the parachutists stand-up and hookup, the following procedures will apply: 17.28.5.1.  Under Acceptable Conditions: Maintain an acceptable altitude and attitude for the  parachutists  to  evacuate  the  aircraft.  The  minimum  acceptable  altitude  is  as  briefed due  to  the  differences  in  parachute  employment  limitations  (Reference  AFI  11-410, Personnel Parachute Operations). If the jump must be made at airspeed in excess of 150 KIAS,  advise parachutists of the airspeed and  altitude.  Order evacuation of the aircraft by giving the prebriefed signals for preparation and bailout. 17.28.5.2.  Under  Unacceptable  Conditions.  When  conditions  are  not  acceptable  for aircraft  evacuation  or  drop  is  aborted  for  other  reasons,  the  following  procedures  will apply:  The red light  will be turned "On" and will remain on until  exit doors are closed. The pilot will advise the loadmaster, who in turn will advise the jumpmaster, to have the parachutists unhook, take their seats, and fasten their safety belts. 17.28.6.  Fouled/Towed Parachutist Procedures. 17.28.6.1.  The jumpmaster or safety is responsible to observe the fouled parachutist and recommend whether to retrieve or cut the parachutist free. If all parachutists have exited and  there  is  no  jumpmaster  on  board,  this  responsibility  rests  with  the  loadmaster.  The recommendation is relayed, by the loadmaster, to the pilot who makes the final decision whether to retrieve or cut the parachutist free. The loadmaster will initiate retrieval or cut the parachutist’s static line on the pilot’s command. 17.28.6.2.  If the parachutist is fouled during a paratroop door exit, the first priority is to retrieve, whether the parachutist is conscious or unconscious.  If the parachutist cannot be retrieved  and indicates  consciousness,  the parachutist  will be cut  free.   For a ramp  exit, AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   181  the first priority is to cut the parachutist free if the parachutist indicates consciousness.  If the parachutist is unconscious, does not signal, cannot be observed, or a condition exists that  prevents  cutting  the  static  line,  implement  emergency  retrieval  procedures. WARNING:  There is not an effective or consistently reliable means to manually retrieve a fouled parachutist  from  either the paratroop door or ramp  and door.  Manual  retrieval techniques will vary, depending upon the scenario, and should be exercised with extreme caution. 17.28.6.3.  Upon being notified of a fouled parachutist: 17.28.6.3.1.  The jumpmaster stops remaining parachutists and the loadmaster notifies the pilot of a fouled parachutist. 17.28.6.3.2.  The  pilot  should  lower  the  landing  gear  and  configure  the  aircraft  flap setting to 100 percent flaps (paratroop door exits only). WARNING:  If a parachutist becomes  fouled  during  missions  when  the  aircraft  is  operating  with  a  high  gross weight  or  is  flying  in  a  high  density  altitude  environment,  the  pilot  may  elect  to maintain  flaps  at  50  percent,  landing  gear  up,  and  slow  to  PJ  MOS  in  lieu  of  the standard procedure. 17.28.6.3.3.  The  pilot  maintains  at  least  the  minimum  drop  altitude  (AGL)  for  the type  parachute  being  used,  and  avoids  flying  over  or  upwind  of  water  or  built  up areas. EXCEPTION: If the parachutist is equipped for a water drop, the pilot should avoid  flying  over  land.    CAUTION:    If  possible,  the  pilot  will  avoid  turning  the aircraft in  the direction of the fouled parachutist.  Turning into the parachutist  often starts violent swinging of the parachutist and poses an increased possibility of injury. 17.28.6.3.4.  The PM turns on the red light. 17.28.6.3.5.  The parachutist indicates consciousness and that the reserve parachute is ready by maintaining a tight body position with both hands on the reserve parachute. 17.28.6.3.6.  If  the  pilot‘s  decision  is  to  cut  the  parachutist  free,  the  parachutist‘s static line will be cut by the loadmaster on the pilot‘s command. 17.28.6.3.7.  If the decision is to retrieve the parachutist, refer to expanded checklist and AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-2 for procedures. 17.28.7.  High Altitude Personnel Airdrop Specific Procedures.  See  paragraphs 17.26 and 17.27 for additional information on high altitude airdrops requirements and procedures. 17.28.7.1.  The navigator will compute a high altitude release point (HARP) solution for all HALO or HAHO drops unless specific mission directives dictate otherwise.  NOTE:  HALO or HAHO drops may be JMD. 17.28.7.2.  Flaps.  Normal  configuration  is  with  50  percent  flaps.  However,  at  high altitudes, it may be desirable to use less flaps. 17.28.7.3.  Exits. 17.28.7.3.1.  Parachutists  will  normally  exit  from  the  cargo  door  and  ramp.  All parachutists,  with  the  exception  of  the  jumpmaster,  will  stand  forward  of  the  ramp hinge until the One-Minute Warning.   182  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 17.28.7.3.2.  A paratroop door may be used in lieu of the cargo door and ramp. When this  is  the  case,  air  deflector  doors  will  be  opened.  All  parachutists,  except jumpmaster, will stand forward of the paratroop door until the One Minute Warning.  NOTE:  Jump  platforms  must  be  installed.    NOTE:    All  parachutists,  including jumpmaster, will exit the aircraft during the green light time. 17.28.7.4.  Communications  and  Signals.  The  loadmaster  will  coordinate  the  following hand signals with the jumpmaster: 17.28.7.4.1.  Time  warnings  (20-,  10-,  6-,  2-,  and  1-minute)  may  be  given  to  the parachutists by the loadmaster pointing at a watch and then indicating with fingers the correct warning. 17.28.7.4.2.  The  velocity  of  winds  on  the  DZ  will  be  given  by  the  loadmaster  by cupping one hand and blowing into it, then indicating with upturned fingers the speed of the wind. 17.28.7.4.3.  A no drop will be indicated by passing a hand across the throat. 17.28.7.4.4.  Loadmasters will have pencil and paper available during airdrops for use in communicating with parachutists. 17.29.  Combination Drops.  (T-1) Combination drops are those during which parachutists exit from  the  aircraft  ramp  after  the  deployment  of  an  airdrop  load  (CDS,  Combat  Rubber  Raiding Craft (CRRC), Container Ramp Load, etc). 17.29.1.  The drop altitude will be determined by the item requiring the highest drop altitude. 17.29.2.  Procedures.  In  addition  to  the  equipment  CARP,  the  navigator  will  compute  a personnel CARP down track from the equipment release point using the computed exit time for the equipment drop as the interval between the equipment and personnel CARP. Use the same air speed and altitude as for the equipment for this computation. If the computed release point will result in any jumper landing within 150 yards of any boundary of the DZ, inform the jumpmaster. Release the equipment at the equipment CARP, followed by the parachutists when the door is clear. 17.30.  Door  Bundle  Airdrops.  (T-1)  A-7A  or  A-21  containers  weighing  up  to  500  pounds [excluding the weight of the parachutes] are referred to as "door bundles" and are dropped from the aircraft through the paratroop door or ramp and door using the PERSONNEL/EQUIPMENT AIRDROP or SEARCH AND RESCUE DEPLOYMENT Checklist.  Loads weighing more than 350  pounds  require  two  trained  designated  pushers  to  assist  the  loadmaster/jumpmaster  in pushing loads from the aircraft. 17.30.1.  Door  bundles  may  be  dropped  independently  or  with  personnel  and  are  limited  to one bundle per exit used. When dropped with personnel, the bundle is the first object to exit the aircraft. 17.30.2.  During  unilateral  single-ship  airdrop  training,  door  bundles  will  not  exit  aircraft after  a  paratrooper  has  jumped.    NOTE:  During  joint  training,  a  combat  or  contingency operation,  the  user  determines  door  bundle  requirements  and  order  of  exit  from  any  or  all personnel airdrop aircraft in the formation. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   183  17.30.3.  Remove  restraints  and  position  the  bundle  in  the  paratroop  door  or  on  the  ramp prior to completion of the SLOWDOWN checklist (EXCEPTION:  If the jumpmaster needs the  paratroop  door  for  spotting,  place  the  door  bundle  as  close  as  possible  to  the  paratroop door).    If  jumpers  are  to  follow  the  door  bundle,  the  user  is  responsible  for  ejecting  the bundle  out  the  troop  door  or  off  the  ramp.  Maintain  positive  control  of  all  door  bundles exiting  out  the  cargo  ramp.    To  maintain  positive  control  of  door  bundles  exiting  over  the ramp, it may be necessary to secure the forward end of the bundle to a suitable floor tiedown ring  with  550  cord  or  suitable  substitute.    This  tie  is  to  prevent  premature  release  of  the bundle and will be cut by the loadmaster at the release point. 17.30.3.1.  Door  bundles  dropped  from  the  paratroop  doors  will  be  rigged  with  non-breakaway static lines. The dimensions, including the parachute, must not exceed 48” by 30” by 66” unless authorized in a specific T.O. When the container is placed in the door for airdrop, place the largest dimension in the vertical or upright position. 17.30.3.2.  Door  bundles  followed  by  paratroopers  dropped  from  the  ramp  and  door  or paratroop door(s) will be rigged with a T-10 parachute (converted for cargo) or parachute equipped  with  breakaway  static  lines  (per  TO  13C7-1-11).  Also,  bundles  rigged  for  a ramp  exit  are  equipped  with  a  skid  board  compatible  with  the  center  roller  conveyors.  NOTE: If no parachutists are to be dropped after the door bundles, non-breakaway static lines will be used. Anchor cable stops will be positioned as depicted in T.O. 1C-130A-9 for CDS airdrops. 17.31.  Container  Ramp  Loads  (CRL)/Ramp  Bundle.  (T-1)  Container  ramp  loads  may consist  of  A-series  containers  (e.g.  RAMZ  bundle,  double  A-22,  single  A-22/A-23)  or  loads rigged  on  combat  expendable  platforms  (e.g.  ATV,  motorcycle)  rigged  for  airdrop  from  the cargo ramp or floor.  CRLs are individually restrained with a length of Type VIII nylon webbing (release gate) routed through ramp/floor tiedown rings and secured to the container webbing on the  forward  and  aft  side.    At  the  release  point  the  loadmaster  manually  cuts  the  release  gate, allowing the bundle to exit from the aircraft. 17.31.1.  Ramp bundles must be rigged IAW T.O. 13C7-series, FM 10-500, and USSOCOM 350-series  directives.  The  total  weight  of  the  bundle  will  not  exceed  2335  pounds.  Skid boards/combat expendable platforms will be compatible with intermediate roller conveyors. The total rigged weight of the load will not exceed 2,335 pounds. loads may be followed by parachutists.  These  procedures  can  be  accomplished  from  either  side  of  the  cargo  ramp  or from  centerline.  Specific  aircraft  preparations  and  rigging  procedures  are  contained  in T.O.1C-130A-9. 17.31.2.  Loads  to  be  followed  by  parachutists  will  be  rigged  with  breakaway  static  lines, unless specified in specific rigging directive. 17.31.3.  The maximum number of CRLs that can be airdropped on one pass is two.  When dropping  two  CRLs,  one  will  be  rigged  on  the  ramp  and  one  will  be  rigged  on  the  cargo floor.    When  mission  requirements  dictate  dropping  more  than  two  CRLs,  they  must  be rigged in A-series containers, using CDS procedures in T.O. 1C-130A-9, and dropped using the CDS AIRDROP Checklist.   184  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 17.31.4.  Aircrew  Procedures.  Use  the  PERSONNEL/EQUIPMENT  AIRDROP  Checklist.  Use  the  SEARCH  AND  RESCUE  DEPLOYMENT  Checklist  for  PJD  RAMZ/ATV  CRL airdrops. 17.31.4.1.  Aircraft configuration.  Use 50 percent flap setting.  NOTE:  50 percent flaps results  in  a  flat  deck  angle  ensuring  the  aft  bundle  does  not  move  and  gives  the loadmaster time to cut both gates and push the bundle(s).  At no time will the deck angle be nose down. 17.31.4.2.  CARP  Calculations.  Reference  paragraph  17.29.2 for  combination drops.  NOTE:  For dual CRL drops, personnel exit time is computed from the time the forward  bundle  (bundle  resting  on  the  cargo  floor)  exits  the  aircraft.    Crews  must  be aware that the exit time will be longer for multiple CRL drops and factor this into usable drop-zone time.  NOTE:  If the load is rigged on the ramp, recommend using a 2 second exit time for 50 percent  flaps.  Otherwise, interpolate exit time using data listed in  AFI 11-231, Table 9.19. 17.31.5.  Loadmaster  Procedures.  The  procedures  listed  below  are  for  use  with  the PERSONNEL/EQUIPMENTAIRDROP Checklist. 17.31.5.1.  Aircraft Preparation. Prepare the aircraft IAW T.O. 1C-130A-9. 17.31.5.1.1.  Use two rollers under each bundle.  Remove and stow all other rollers to allow a clear path of travel for the loadmasters and jumpers. 17.31.5.1.2.  Loadmaster  will  use  restraint  harnesses  when  dropping  using  these procedures 17.31.5.2.  After loading.  Rig the bundle(s) IAW T.O. 1C-130A-9. 17.31.5.2.1.  For  a  CRL  bundle  resting  on  the  floor,  position  the  8/7-cord  static  line safety  tie  on  the  aft  left  (HC-130)/right  (MC-130)  side  of  the  bundle  if  the  jumpers are using static line parachutes 17.31.5.2.2.  For  a  CRL  bundle  resting  on  the  floor,  position  the  8/7-cord  static  line safety  tie  on,  on  the  aft  right  (HC-130)/  left  (MC-130)  side  of  the  bundle  if  the jumpers are using free fall parachutes. 17.31.5.3.  Ten-Minute Checklist. 17.31.5.3.1.  Before  completion  of  the  TEN-MINUTE  Checklist,  if  dropping  two CRLs, the loadmasters may remove all the restraint from the CRL resting on the floor and all the restraint, except the forward restraint strap, on the CRL positioned on the ramp.    The  forward  restraint  will  be  removed  after  the  ramp  is  in  the  horizontal position, prior to the completion of the SLOWDOWN Checklist. 17.31.5.3.2.  If the drop is aborted, reapply all the bundles restraint. 17.31.5.4.  One-Minute Warning. 17.31.5.4.1.  The jumpers are cleared to line up along side of the CRL resting on the floor  but  will  not  move aft  of  FS  737  or  behind  the  forward  CRL  static  line,  which ever is more restrictive. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   185  17.31.5.4.2.  At  the  navigator’s  “5  Seconds”  call,  the  loadmasters  will  move  into position to cut the bundles Type VIII gates.  One loadmaster will be in position to cut the aft bundle while the other loadmaster will be in position to cut the forward bundle. 17.31.5.5.  Green Light. 17.31.5.5.1.  After hearing and seeing green light, the loadmaster will cut the gate of the  aft  bundle  (bundle  resting  on  the  ramp)  with  a  V-blade  knife  (the  bundle  may begin to exit depending on deck angle) and quickly move forward to assist in pushing the forward bundle (resting on the cargo floor). 17.31.5.5.2.  Once the loadmaster is forward of all bundles and  clear of all the static lines, the second loadmaster will cut the forward CRL gate. 17.31.5.5.3.  After both gates have been cut the loadmasters will push the bundles out together  as  quickly  as  possible.    The  loadmasters  should  be  prepared  to  exert  extra force on the bundles once they contact each other. 17.31.5.5.4.  The jumpers are clear to follow once the forward bundle has crossed FS 737. 17.31.6.  Emergency  Procedures.  Follow  either  CDS  emergency  procedures  or  fouled parachutist procedures as required. 17.32.  Container Delivery System (CDS).  (T-1) CDS is designed to airdrop A-22/A-23, A-7, A-21,  double  A-22/A-23  containers  and  loads  rigged  on  combat  expendable  platforms.  The weight  of  each  container  and  type  parachute  used  should  be  IAW  T.O.  13C7-1-11,  Airdrop  of Supplies and Equipment—Rigging Containers and Field Manual 10-501, Airdrop of Supplies and Equipment: Rigging Containers. 17.32.1.  CDS  procedures  may  be  used  to  airdrop  up  to  five  individual  A-22  containers, single  stick,  from  Rescue  HC-130  without  a  dual  rail  cargo  handling  system  (intermediate rollers are  required). Containers can be  rigged and dropped one at  a time or up to  five in  a single stick. 17.32.2.  Use  normal  CDS  rigging  procedures  outlined  in  T.O.  1C-130A-9,  with  the following exceptions:  the release gate for single containers, multiple containers rigged in a single stick configuration or combat expendable platforms that do not exceed 3500 pounds, may be rigged using Type VIII nylon.  For loads between 3100 pounds and 3500 pounds the release gate will be rigged using one turn double Type VIII nylon. For single stick container loads that exceed 3500 pounds use Type XXVI nylon. Multiple container releases exceeding 3500  pounds  require  standard  rigging  and  release  with  a  static  line  retriever  as  outlined  in Chapter 7, T.O. 1C-130A-9.  After the release gate is cut, the airdrop load exits the aircraft by  gravity  force.    CAUTION:    Standard  tiedown  procedures  contained  in  T.O.  1C-130A-9 will be used to secure airdrop loads in the aircraft.  Because a buffer stop assembly cannot be installed, the normal maximum total container weight is 5000 pounds.  When the total rigged weight of the airdrop load exceeds 5000 pounds, MAJCOM/A3T (A3J for ACC) approval is required. 17.32.3.  Aircrew Procedures. 17.32.3.1.  Use the CDS AIRDROP Checklist.   186  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 17.32.3.2.  Flap Settings. Accomplish  the slowdown initially setting flaps to  50 percent. As the airspeed decreases to drop airspeed, reset the flaps IAW the CDS flap setting chart located  in  AFI  11-2HC-130  CL-1.    NOTE:  The  CDS  flap  setting  will  give  an approximate  6  to  8  degree  nose-high  attitude.  Maintain  this  attitude  and  level  flight throughout the drop. 17.32.3.3.  The  aircraft  will  tend  to  pitch  up  as  the  load  exits  the  aircraft.  WARNING: This pitch must be anticipated and controlled to allow no more than two or three degrees additional pitch. Do not over control to the point that negative G forces are encountered while  the  load  is  exiting  the  aircraft,  as  this  increases  exit  time  or  may  stop  load movement. 17.32.3.4.  It  is  not  recommended  to  drop  CDS  at  gross  weights  less  than  104,000 pounds.  If drop must be made, use zero flaps and expect longer than normal exit time. 17.32.3.5.  When the loadmaster calls “Load Clear”, the flaps will be reset to 50 percent. 17.32.3.6.  Gate Cuts.  Manual CDS gate cuts are authorized for all single stick container loads that do not exceed 5000 pounds total rigged weight. The following procedures and definitions further explain and clarify limitations: 17.32.3.6.1.  Normal  System  Release.  The  normal  system  release  method  utilizes normal rigging of the static line retriever and guillotine knife to cut/release the CDS gate.  The CDS  gate is  cut  by  activating the static line retriever.  Refer to T.O. 1C-130A-9  for  specific  rigging  procedures.    A  subsequent  drop  will  prevent  the  use  of the  static  line  retriever  and  requires  an  alternate  method  of  gate  release.  Alternate methods of cutting the release gate are described below in the following paragraphs. 17.32.3.6.2.  Manual  System  Release.  This  method  is  performed  by  the  loadmaster pulling  down  sharply  on  a  tiedown  strap  looped  over  the  static  line  retriever  cable.  Loadmasters will delay three seconds after “Green Light” is called before performing a  manual  system  release.    This  method  can  only  be  used  when  authorized  by  the mission commander. 17.32.3.6.3.  Manual Gate Cut.  This method is performed by using a knife or V-blade knife  to  cut/release  the  CDS  gate.    Loadmasters  will  manually  cut  the  CDS  release gate  upon  hearing  and  seeing  “Green  Light”  during  the  execution  of  the  CDS AIRDROP Checklist.  All single stick container loads that do not exceed 5000 pounds may be released using the manual gate cut method. 17.32.3.6.4.  Manual Combat Cut.  This method is performed by using a knife or V-blade  knife  to  cut/release  the  CDS  gate  regardless  of  the  amount/configuration  of CDS  on  board.    It  is  intended  to  be  used  only  in  combat  and  only  after  receiving authorization from the mission commander.  This method allows loadmasters to scan for  threats  more  efficiently  prior  to  and  immediately  after  the  drop.  Mission commanders  should  carefully  consider  crew  experience  prior  to  authorizing  this procedure and extreme caution should be used. 17.32.3.7.  Combination Airdrops. During combination CDS drops: 17.32.3.7.1.  The jumpers will line up forward of the alternate forward barrier at the 10-minute warning. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   187  17.32.3.7.2.  After hearing and seeing green light, one loadmaster will cut the release gate manually or via the static line retriever. 17.32.3.7.3.  The other loadmaster will immediately lower the forward barrier as the loads begins to exit from the aircraft allowing the PJs to exit directly behind the CDS loads. 17.32.4.  CDS Emergency Procedures.  If the release gate fails to cut or the load fails to exit. The crew will take the following corrective actions: 17.32.4.1.  When notified of a malfunction, the pilot will direct the flight engineer or PM to extend additional flaps and lower the nose to maintain a slight nose down attitude until the ramp and door are closed and the load is secured. 17.32.4.2.  PF will maintain drop airspeed and AGL altitude (if possible) and avoid flying over or upwind of water or built up areas. 17.32.4.3.  PM will turn on the red light. 17.32.4.4.  The loadmaster will alert parachutists (if required) to remain forward/clear of the load. 17.32.4.5.  The loadmaster will raise the aft anchor cable supports (if required). 17.32.4.6.  The Loadmaster will clear the ramp and door to close.  WARNING: When the cargo ramp and door cannot be closed from the cockpit, the loadmaster secures the load for aft movement. Ensure the lifeline is attached to a tiedown ring no further aft than FS 677 prior to proceeding aft to operate the cargo ramp and door controls.   CAUTION: If the  load  is  jammed  in  the  ramp  area,  the  loadmaster  will  notify  the  engineer  to  stop closing action when the cargo door is released from the uplocks. After the load is secured and  the  ramp  area  is  clear,  the  loadmaster  will  close  the  ramp  and  door  from  the  aft control panel (if possible). 17.32.4.7.  The loadmaster will secure the load for landing 17.32.4.8.  After  completing COMPLETION OF AIRDROP Checklist. the  CDS  MALFUNCTION  Checklist,  perform the 17.33.  Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC) Drop.  (T-1) The raiding craft is normally an inflated, 16 foot rubber boat mounted on a specially constructed expendable platform. Equipment and supplies (including outboard motor, fuel, and other supplies) are secured inside the boat. The platform,  weighted  with  sandbags,  sinks  when  it  is  cut  away  from  the  boat  in  the  water.  Total rigged weight is approximately 2000 pounds.  Rigged IAW T.O.13C7-51-21. 17.33.1.  Aircrew Procedures. 17.33.1.1.  Use the CDS AIRDROP Checklist. One CRRC with up to 19 personnel or 2 (stacked)  CRRC  with  18  personnel  can  be  safely  airdropped  on  one  pass.  Compute  a CARP,  unless  mission  directives  dictate  otherwise.  If  aircraft  gross  weight  exceeds 120,000 pounds, perform the airdrop at 140 KIAS using the 140 KIAS flap setting chart. EXCEPTION: For combination drops above 120,000 pounds, perform the airdrop at 130 KIAS using the 130 KIAS flap setting chart.   188  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 17.33.1.2.  DZ Axis.  If possible, the DZ axis will be into the drop altitude wind (+ or  - 30 degrees) when the wind is 5 knots or greater. The jumpmaster will be advised if this cannot be complied with. 17.33.1.3.  The following will apply when dropping two CRRCs on one pass: 17.33.1.3.1.  The forward release gate must be manually cut by the loadmaster. 17.33.1.3.2.  The second loadmaster must be positioned in the paratroop door prior to completion of the ten-minute warning. 17.33.2.  Training and Exercises. 17.33.2.1.  One  or  more  recovery  boats  will  be  in  position  to  recover  platforms, parachutes, and personnel. The boat should be displaced 400 yards or more from the DZ axis.  The navigators can confirm  the release point  and the offset  distance from  the boat visually or by using radar returns. 17.33.2.2.  Limitations.  Surface  wind  limitations  IAW  AFI  13-217.    For  combination drops with personnel sea state limits are 3 Ft High Chop/4 Ft High Swells. 17.33.3.  Emergency  Procedures.  Follow  either  CDS  emergency  procedures  or  fouled parachutist procedures as required. 17.34.  Rigging,  Alternate  Method,  Zodiac/All-Terrain  Vehicle (RAMZ/ATV) Airdrops.  (T-1) The RAMZ consists of a deflated Zodiac F470 combat rubber raiding craft with a 35 horsepower outboard engine rigged for low  velocity  airdrop from any  C-130 aircraft. The RAMZ engine is configured in a plywood box and is secured in a standard A-22 container using two  modified  T-10C  parachutes.  When  rigged  for  deployment,  the  RAMZ  package  weighs between  600  and  1,000  pounds.  The  ATV  is  rigged  IAW  Army  Field  Manual  10-500-77, Airdrop of Supplies and Equipment: Rigging Motorcycles, and Air Force Technical Order 13C7-55-1,  Airdrop  of  Supplies  and  Equipment--Rigging  Motorcycles.  ATVs  are  rigged  on  combat expendable platforms and dropped using G-12E cargo parachutes equipped with 15 ft. extraction (deployment) parachute packed in T-10 deployment bag. 17.34.1.  Employment. Parachutists may exit the aircraft using MFF or static line procedures. 17.34.2.  DZ  Axis.  If  possible,  the  DZ  axis  will  be  into  the  drop  altitude  wind  (+  or  –  30 degrees)  when  the  wind  is  5  knots  or  greater.  The  jumpmaster  will  be  advised  when  this cannot be complied with. 17.34.3.  Aircraft  Preparation.  The  aircraft  will  be  configured  IAW  AFI  11-2HC-130V3, Addenda  A.  The  RAMZ/ATV  package  will  be  delivered  to  the  aircraft  fully  rigged  and prepared  for  loading  on  the  aircraft.  The  loadmaster  is  responsible  for  aircraft  preparation, rigging the release gate, attaching the static line, and securing the package in the aircraft. 17.34.3.1.  RAMZ/ATV Preflight. Prior to flight, the loadmaster will ensure that no fuel is leaking from the RAMZ/ATV bundle. A leaking bundle will not be loaded aboard the aircraft  or  will  be  downloaded  if  already  aboard.  The  fuel  bladders  have  a  tendency  to emit  fumes.  If  one  or  more  RAMZ/ATV  is  loaded  aboard  the  aircraft  the  day  prior  to flight, there may be noticeable fumes in the aircraft the following day. The fumes may be decreased or eliminated by venting the aircraft overnight. One technique is to close both paratroop doors onto the extended jump platforms and secure them with tie down straps. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   189  If  the  RAMZ/ATV  is  emitting  fumes  and  the  aircraft  must  temporarily  remain pressurized,  taping  the  urinal  covers  open  may  reduce  or  eliminate  the  fumes.  WARNING: If flammable fumes are present, unnecessary electrical  equipment/switches will not be turned on or off until the fumes are eliminated. Use 100 percent oxygen and accomplish  the  Smoke  and  Fume  Elimination  Checklist  as  appropriate.    WARNING: Only  15-foot  static  lines  will  be  used  on  the  RAMZ  cargo  parachutes.  A  12-foot  static line extended to 15 feet will not be used.  If personnel are to follow immediately after the RAMZ, their static lines will also be 15 feet.  NOTE: A maximum of three RAMZ/ATV bundles  can  be  rigged  on  the  Rescue  HC-130  when  the  aircraft  internal  fuel  tanks  are installed.    When  using  CRL  procedures,  a  maximum  of  2  RAMZ/ATV  bundles  can  be rigged  on  the  Rescue  HC-130.    WARNING:  When  rigging  two  RAMZ  bundles  on  the cargo  ramp,  use  extreme  care  to  ensure  the  aircraft  CG  remains  within  tolerances.  CAUTION:  For  RAMZ  deployments  at  night,  when  requested  by  the  user,  two illumination parachute flares will be loaded in the flare launcher tubes or be immediately available for manual deployment prior to starting the pre-slowdown checklist. If used, the flare launcher must remain "Deactivated" and "Safe" until personnel and equipment have deployed  and  are  a  safe  distance  from  the  aircraft.    NOTE:  When  loaded  aboard  the aircraft,  the  vertical  restraint  tie  down  strap  on  the  RAMZ  will  be  secured  in  such  a manner that it is not placed over any fuel bladder, just tight enough to take the slack out of the strap. The vertical strap acts as a backup to the 5,000-pound gate. 17.34.3.2.  Airplanes with Static Line Retriever. Position the left (HC-130) or right (MC-130) anchor cable stop at FS 893 and tape. The left/right anchor cable will be utilized for attachment of both the container and the personnel static lines.  WARNING: Static lines for both RAMZ/ATV and parachutists will be hooked to the same anchor cable. No more than  20  static  lines  may  be  airdropped  on  a  single  pass  (i.e.,  one  RAMZ/ATV  and  19 jumpers, two RAMZ/ATV and 18 jumpers, etc.). 17.34.3.3.  Airplanes without Static Line Retriever.  Install and tape anchor cable stop at FS  749  for  single  cable  use.  RAMZ/ATV  static  lines  will  be  attached  to  this  cable.  WARNING:  Parachutists  using  static  line  deployed  parachutes  will  not  jump  from airplanes without an operational static line retriever. 17.34.3.4.  Skid boards must be a minimum of 48” by 48”. 17.34.4.  Deployment Altitudes. 17.34.4.1.  The minimum deployment altitude will be 3,000 feet AWL/AGL when the PJs exit using non-static line deployed parachutes. Higher altitudes may be used for training. 17.34.4.2.  For  operational  missions,  minimum  altitude  with  non-static  line  deployed  a parachute is 2,500 feet AWL/AGL. 17.34.4.3.  The  minimum  deployment  altitude  for  training  or  non-combat  single-pass combination  air  drops  of  RAMZ/ATV  and  PJs  exiting  with  static  lines  will  be  800  feet AWL/AGL.  NOTE: The RAMZ/ATV and PJs will be deployed from the same altitude. 17.34.5.  Deployment  Methods.  RAMZ/ATV  packages  will  be  deployed  by  one  of  the following methods:   190  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 17.34.5.1.  CRL  procedures.    Single  pass  navigator  directed  deployment.  Use  the PERSONNEL/EQUIPMENT AIRDROP Checklist. 17.34.5.2.  CDS  procedures.  Single  pass  navigator  directed  deployment.  Use  the  CDS AIRDROP Checklist. 17.34.5.3.  Pararescue  JMD  procedures  with  50  or  70%  flaps  (based  on  gross  weight).  Use the SEARCH AND RESCUE DEPLOYMENT Checklist.  Jumpers may exit on the same  pass  as  equipment  or  on  subsequent  passes  using  PJMD  procedures.  See paragraph  17.24  NOTE:  For  JMD  RAMZ/ATV  drops,  a  navigator’s  CARP/HARP  is not required when using streamers/spotter chutes. 17.34.6.  Deployment Procedures. In addition to  the deployment procedures required by the specific method of delivery being used, the following apply: 17.34.6.1.  Parachutists using static line deployed parachutes will attach their static lines to the same anchor cable to which the RAMZ/ATV static lines are attached or jump on a subsequent pass after the RAMZ/ATV static line deployment bags are retrieved. 17.34.6.2.  Military  free  fall  parachutists  may  exit  from  the  aircraft  ramp  on  the  same pass after the RAMZ/ATV static line deployment bags are retrieved or cut, or exit on a subsequent  pass  using  Fixed/Moving  target  PJD procedures,  as  appropriate.  If  dropping from  the  paratroop  door  on  the  subsequent  pass,  complete  the  POST-DEPLOYMENT Checklist, and initiate the PRE-DEPLOYMENT Checklist. 17.34.6.3.  For  JMD  drops,  at  the  pilot’s  "One  Minute  Advisory"  call,  the  jumpmaster will be on either side of the cargo ramp and may be spotting from the aft end. Additional jumpers  will  be  forward  of  the  RAMZ/ATV.  The  loadmaster  will  be  positioned  to remove  aft  restraint  and  to  observe  equipment  and  jumpers  at  all  times.  At  the  "One Minute Advisory," the jumpmaster will be alerted, the load release gate is checked, and the aft restraint is removed. 17.34.6.4.  The  loadmaster  will  relay  "Safety  Checks  Complete"  to  the  pilot  if  the jumpmaster  has  already  gone  off  interphone.  The  PM  will  turn  on  the  green  light, indicating to the jumpmaster that conditions are satisfactory for the airdrop. 17.34.6.5.  The jumpmaster will determine the exit point and deploy prior to receiving a "No Drop" notification or seeing the red light on. The loadmaster will relay to the pilot all  visual  corrections  given  by  the  jumpmaster.  The  jumpmaster  will  signal  for  the loadmaster to  cut  the  release  gate.    WARNING:  (T-1)  If a  "No Drop" is  called  and the RAMZ/ATV is held in place by only the release gate, all personnel will move forward of the  load,  except  the  loadmaster  and  the  jumpmaster  who  will  monitor  the  RAMZ/ATV for possible shifting and secure as necessary.  WARNING: If the RAMZ/ATV exits the aircraft but fails to properly deploy, the static lines will be cut immediately.  CAUTION: The release gate must be cut below the knot to allow the nylon strap to pull free through floor tie down rings. 17.34.7.  Completion of Drop. 17.34.7.1.  During  JMD  airdrops,  post-deployment  checks  can  be  deferred  until completion  of  the  last  drop.  However,  crews  will  accomplish  applicable  steps  of  the AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   191  POST-DEPLOYMENT  Checklist  and CHECKLIST, as required, when necessary to change the aircraft or door configuration. the  PRE-DEPLOYMENT re-accomplish 17.34.7.2.  For navigator directed releases.  Accelerate to 140 KIAS, climb or descend as briefed, and perform the COMPLETION OF DROP Checklist. 17.34.8.  Training and Exercises. 17.34.8.1.  One  or  more  safety  recovery  boats  will  be  in  position  to  recover  platforms, parachutes, and personnel. The boat should be displaced 400 yards or more from the DZ axis.  The navigators can confirm  the release point  and the offset  distance from  the boat visually or by using radar returns. 17.34.8.2.  Limitations. Wind limits IAW AFI 13-217. 17.34.9.  Emergency  Procedures.  Follow  either  the  CDS  emergency  procedures  or  fouled parachutist procedures as required. 17.35.  Standard  Airdrop  Training  Bundle  (SATB).  (T-1)  The  15-pound  standard  airdrop training bundle may be dropped to simulate personnel or equipment. SATBs will be assembled and have an identification tag attached in accordance with T.O. 13C7-1-11. SATBs will not be rigged with a breakaway static line. 17.35.1.  Aircrew Procedures. Conduct SATB missions at the altitude and airspeed specified for  the  drop  being  simulated.  Use  the  applicable  airdrop  checklist  for  the  type  airdrop simulated. 17.35.2.  Emergency  Procedures.  If  a  training  bundle  is  outside  the  aircraft  and  fails  to separate, make no attempt to retrieve it. Cut the bundle loose over the prebriefed salvo area or  DZ.  When  simulating  an  airdrop  using  the  cargo  ramp  and  door,  a  hung  bundle  could become  wedged  in  the  aircraft  elevator  during  turns.  If  possible,  cut  the  static  line  prior  to making a turn. 17.36.  Specialized Rescue Airdrops.  (T-1) Specialized rescue airdrops [parabundles and MA-1/2 Kit] will be conducted using the SEARCH AND RESCUE Checklists.  See AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. 17.36.1.  Minimum drop altitudes.  The minimum drop altitude for parabundle and MA-1 Kit deployments is 300 ft AGL during the day and 500 ft AGL at night. 17.36.2.  HC-130 aircraft are authorized to  perform  loadmaster directed airdrops of bundles off the ramp, to include trial-line drops, while spotting from an open paratroop door [single paratroop door open only]. 17.36.2.1.  This configuration will be used when equipment size precludes exit from the paratroop door or trail line drops procedures are used. 17.36.2.2.  This configuration will be used for equipment only drops and is not authorized for personnel  deployment.    WARNING:   Under  no circumstances will a  paratroop door and ramp and door be open at the same time when parachutists are involved. 17.36.2.3.  If the bundle/equipment  dropped from the ramp  requires spotting procedures from an open paratroop door, ensure life lines are properly adjusted for both exits.   192  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 17.36.2.4.  During paratroop door first, then open the cargo ramp and door. the  PRE-SEARCH/PRE-DEPLOYMENT  Checklist,  open the 17.36.2.5.  During  the  POST-SEARCH/POST-DEPLOYMENT  Checklist,  close  the cargo ramp and door first, then close the paratroop door. 17.37.  Free  Fall  Airdrops.  (T-1) Free fall airdrop is the delivery of non-fragile items without parachutes at very low altitudes. 17.37.1.  Aircrew  Procedures.    Use  either  the  PERSONNEL/EQUIPMENT  AIRDROP  or SEARCH AND RESCUE DEPLOYMENT Checklist. 17.37.2.  Minimum Drop Altitudes. Daylight drops will be made at 150 feet AGL and night drops no lower than 300 feet AGL. 17.37.3.  Drift Effect. For free-fall airdrops, wind drift need not be considered. 17.37.4.  DZ size.  DZ size will be determined by the trajectory of the items being dropped. As a rule, DZ length required equals the altitude of the aircraft over the release point plus a safety margin of 100 feet added to each end. Applying this rule, when dropping from 200 feet AGL, the required length will be 200 feet (altitude) plus 200 feet (safety margin) or 400 feet total. Additional crewmembers may be needed to eject the load. 17.38.  Low  Cost  Low Altitude  (LCLA)  Airdrop.  LCLA airdrop is an aerial delivery  system consisting of low-weight airdrop bundles deployed from the aircraft ramp and door at very low altitudes, enabling circular error (CE) accuracy within 100 meters. Refer to applicable TO, TTP and supporting MAJCOM guidance for LCLA procedures. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   193  Chapter 18 REFUELING OPERATIONS 18.1.  General.  This  section  provides  guidance  on  helicopter  air  to  air  refueling  (HAAR),  hot gas  operations  and  forward  area  refueling  (FARP).  It  provides  parameters  used  to  employ  the techniques  and  procedures  of  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130.  If  a  discrepancy  exists  between  this instruction and a tactics manual, the information in this instruction will take precedence. Section 18A—Helicopter Air-to-Air Refueling 18.2.  HAAR  Operations  (T-1).  HAAR operations will be conducted IAW ATP-56B, AFTTP 3-3.HC-130, the flight manual and the following guidance. 18.2.1.  Minimum HAAR Altitudes. 18.2.1.1.  Training. Helicopter air refueling will not be conducted below a 1,000 AGL on normal  training  missions.  Waiver  authority  for  HAAR  down  to  500  feet  AGL  is  the MAJCOM/A3 or deployed equivalent.  OG/CCs may request standing waivers for local HAAR  tracks  and  recurring  major  exercises  to  be  included  in  their  supplement  to  this instruction.   NOTE:  Low altitude HAAR training will not be conducted at tanker gross weights  above  130,000  pounds  or  without  three  engine  climb  capability  of  at  least  500 fpm. 18.2.1.2.  Contingency/Combat. Plan HAAR altitudes as follows: 18.2.1.2.1.  Day  Operations:    Compute  air  refueling  altitude  no  lower  than  500  feet AGL within 1 NM of the air refueling/flight planned track. 18.2.1.2.2.  NVG  Operations:  Compute  air  refueling  altitude  no  lower  than  500  feet AGL  above  the  highest  terrain  or  obstacle  within  3  NM  of  the  air  refueling/flight planned track.   NOTE:   Refueling altitudes below 1,000 feet  AGL  may  be required due  to  the  threat  environment  or  weather  conditions  on  actual  rescues  or  combat missions. Final refueling altitude is  determined by  the threat  environment, but  in  no case  will  it  be  lower  than  300  feet  above  the  receivers’  minimum  en  route  altitude capability.    WARNING:  Low  altitude  HAAR  (below  1,000  feet  AGL)  assumes permissive  terrain  and  is  not  normally  possible  at  night  with  unaided  vision.    Large turns  or  course  reversals  while  refueling  below  1,000  feet  AGL  should  be  avoided.   WARNING:  When  operating  at  or  near  minimum  operating  speed,  any  bank  angle could result in a stall without warning. 18.2.2.  ATP-56B, Part 3 guidance is supplemented as follows: 18.2.2.1.  HC-130  aircrews  will  not  use  Rendezvous  (RV)  Altitudes  (AAR  altitude  + 500’)  under  normal  circumstances  during  rendezvous  operations.    Tankers  will  conduct rendezvous and join up operations at refueling altitude (AAR altitude) unless operational requirements dictate otherwise. 18.2.2.2.  HC-130 aircrews will not fly RV BRAVO (Head-On) procedures listed. 18.2.2.3.  Either the tanker or receiver may initiate/direct a “Breakaway” when an unsafe condition is identified.   194  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 Section 18B—Hot Refueling 18.3.  General  (T-1).  For  aircrews,  basic  hot  refueling  is  the  transfer  of  fuel  (refueling  or defueling) with one or more engines running at sites where all required equipment is provided.   Hot refueling certified Aircrew may refuel/defuel at fixed-sites, refuel/defuel with approved fuel trucks and receive fuel  from a fixed-wing tanker at  FARP sites.  Tanker FARP operations also falls  under  the  hot  refueling  umbrella  and  may  be  performed  by  FARP  certified  aircrew.  See Section 18C for FARP specific guidance.  Aircrews may conduct hot refueling operations under NVG conditions. A comprehensive mission briefing and strict compliance with these procedures will  ensure  an  expeditious  and  safe  refueling  operation.    The  guidance  in  this  section supplements  the  procedures  outlined  in  TO  00-25-172,  AFI  11-235,  Forward  Area  Refueling Point  (FARP)  Operations,  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130,  and  checklists.    Request  for  deviations  will  be coordinated through HQ ACC/A3J.  Prior to conducting hot refueling operations, ensure: 18.3.1.  The weapon system and support equipment involved are approved for hot refueling IAW TO 00-25-172. 18.3.2.  Air Force hot refueling sites are approved IAW AFI 11-235 or meet the requirements of TO 00-25- 172. 18.3.3.  Fire protection equipment is available IAW AFI 11-235 and meets the requirements of TO 00-25-172. 18.3.4.  Personnel  performing  hot  refueling  operations  will  have  a  thorough  knowledge  of T.O.  00-25-172,  specifically  section  II  (Electrostatic  Hazards),  section  III  (Bonding),  and section VII (Combat or Contingency Operations).  Personnel operating refueling equipment during blacked-out operations must be Night Vision Goggle (NVG) qualified. 18.3.5.  All Air Force personnel involved with hot refueling operations will be trained IAW AFI 11-235 FORWARD AREA REFUELING POINT (FARP)OPERATIONS and appropriate command directives. 18.3.6.  Refuel  operations at  Air Force hot  refueling sites will not  be conducted within 200 feet  of  aircraft  parking  areas,  50  feet  of  taxing  aircraft,  and  200  feet  of  inhabited  or uninhabited buildings. 18.4.  Terms.  The following terms are unique to hot refueling operations: 18.4.1.  Wet  Wing  Refueling.  Engines  not  running  (power  cart,  GTC,  or  APU  used).    The same checklist and procedures apply as for hot refueling. 18.4.2.  Tanker Operations. The act of providing fuel to a receiver source at  a hot  refueling site. 18.4.3.  Receiver Operations. The act of receiving fuel at a hot refueling site. 18.4.4.  Fuel  Servicing  Safety  Zone  (FSSZ).    The  area  within  50  feet  of  a  pressurized  fuel carrying component and 25 feet around fuel vent outlets of an aircraft. 18.4.5.  Rearming. The upload of munitions on the receiver aircraft. 18.5.  Planning  Factors:  Planners  must  be  aware  of  factors  which  limit  hot  refueling employment  and  should  consider  the  following  when  including  a  hot  refueling  option  in  an exercise or contingency: AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   195  18.5.1.  Passengers.  Personnel and equipment may be off-loaded or on-loaded in conjunction with refueling operations.  Personnel movement on or off the aircraft should be monitored to maintain accountability in case of an emergency. 18.5.2.  Hot  refueling  sites.    Depending  on  the  sister  service  or  host  nation  there  can  be several  different  types  of  hot  refueling  sites.    Some  of  the  different  types  of  sites  are  as follows:   Forward  area  refueling 18.5.2.1.  Forward  Area  Refueling  Equipment  (FARE). equipment  sites  are  normally  setup  by  the  Army  using  blivets  to  refuel  aircraft.    Hot refueling qualified crews may conduct refueling /defueling operation at these sites. 18.5.2.2.  Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP).  Forward area refueling point sites are normally established for aircraft to aircraft refueling.  Hot refueling qualified crews may conduct  receiver  operations  at  these  sites.    NOTE:    Refueling  trucks  may  conduct refueling/defueling operations to a single aircraft at FARP sites. 18.5.2.3.  Hot  Refueling  Site.    Hot  refueling  site  is  a  generic  term  used  for  a  site  that refuels/defuels  aircraft  with  engines  running  from  a  fixed  source  or  a  fuel  truck.  Hot refueling  qualified  crews  may  conduct  operations  at  these  sites.    WARNING:    All  hot refueling sites will have a current site survey and meet the minimum unobstructed egress distance required by the survey to ensure the aircraft can taxi from the site in the event of an emergency.  If the egress distance is less than the required minimum or the egress area is  obstructed,  tanker/receiver  aircraft  will  perform  refueling/defueling  in  a  cold environment (without engines running) only. 18.5.3.  Planners  must  verify  equipment  at  intended  Hot  Refueling  location  is  approved  for use  in  hot  refueling  operations.    Refer  to  T.O.  00-25-172,  T.O.  37A9-7-2-1,  Operation, Maintenance,  and  Illustrated  Parts  Breakdown—Forward  Area  Manifold  Cart,  PN  87940 and the System Safety Engineering Analysis (SSEA) for approved equipment. 18.6.  Crew Duties and Responsibilities.  (T-1) Only current and certified crewmembers will be allowed to occupy a primary crew position on hot refueling missions.   EXCEPTION:  Aircrew in  certification  upgrade  may  occupy  a  primary  crew  position  under  the  supervision  of  an instructor.  Normally these missions will be conducted with a mission crew compliment. 18.6.1.  The minimum crew required to conduct hot refueling operations will be as follows: 18.6.1.1.  Pilot – 2. 18.6.1.2.  Flight engineer – 1. 18.6.1.3.  Loadmaster -1.  NOTE:  The pilot, copilot, and flight engineer will remain on the  flight  deck  in  the  event  of  an  emergency  taxi,  i.e.  moving  the  aircraft.    These  crew positions are the minimum required to fly the aircraft. 18.6.2.  Pilot  in Command (PIC).  The PIC is  responsible for the overall safety of the  crew and the aircraft hot refueling operations.  The PIC relies on the Loadmaster to announce any unusual situations and to recommend the best course of action.  The PIC ensures the crew is briefed  IAW  this  instruction  prior  to  commencing  hot  refueling  operations.    The  aircraft commander will:   196  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 18.6.2.1.  Ensure  approval  has  been  granted  by  the  proper  authority  prior  to  conducting hot refueling operations. 18.6.2.2.  Ensure all crewmembers are briefed on their specific responsibilities. 18.6.2.3.  Analyze  runway  availability  prior  to  landing  to  determine  braking  action.  Unnecessary or heavy braking could delay hot refueling operations. 18.6.2.4.  Analyze planned hot refueling area for hazards and sufficient taxi clearances. 18.6.2.5.  Determine fuel requirements to include estimated onload and offload. 18.6.3.  Flight engineer (FE): The flight engineer will: 18.6.3.1.  Read and ensure compliance with the hot refueling checklist. 18.6.3.2.  Control  fuel  distribution  and  the  SPR  drain  pump  on  UARRSI  modified aircraft. 18.6.3.3.  Coordinate fuel distribution with the loadmaster on Non-UARRSI aircraft. 18.6.4.  Loadmaster (LM).  The LM is responsible for supervising fuel servicing operations. The loadmaster will: 18.6.4.1.  Ensure compliance with all safety procedures. 18.6.4.2.  Immediately  inform  the  pilot  and  advise  the  crew  on  recommended  course  of action, in the event of a hazardous situation/emergency. 18.6.4.3.  Ensure  all  required  equipment  is  on  board  prior  to  and  after  hot  refueling operations. 18.6.4.4.  Operate the ramp and door or paratroop door as required. 18.6.4.5.  Complete  the  hot  brake/hung  flare  check  prior  to  commencing  hot  refueling operations. 18.6.4.6.  Ensures that all personnel are properly briefed on fueling procedures. 18.6.4.7.  Operate the SPR panel and control fuel distribution with coordination from the flight  engineer.    EXCEPTION:    On  UARRSI  modified  aircraft  the  flight  engineer  will control fuel distribution. 18.6.4.8.  Perform leak check at SPR panel. 18.6.4.9.  Secure aircraft for departure after all equipment and personnel are aboard. 18.7.  Hot  Refueling  Equipment  (T-1).  The hot refueling mission requires specific equipment and inspections prior to commencing operations.  Only equipment approved IAW TO 00-25-172, TO  37A9-7-2-1,  and  in  the  system  safety  engineering  analysis  (SSEA)  shall  be  used.    This equipment  is  unique  in  that  it  provides  for  an  internal  bond  that  is  not  provided  for  with conventional  refueling  equipment.    If  unapproved  equipment  is  used,  the  refueling  operation must be accomplished without engines running. 18.7.1.  Those  personnel  who  will  have  direct  contact  with  fueling  operations  during  hot refueling will have the following: 18.7.1.1.  Spare flight gloves. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   197  18.7.1.2.  Extra flight suit or change of clothing, including flight boots. 18.7.1.3.  Full canteen, to be carried on your person. 18.7.1.4.  Sealable water and fuel resistant garment bag to store fuel soaked clothing. 18.7.1.5.  NVGs with spare battery (as required). 18.7.1.6.  Dust goggles (as required). 18.7.1.7.  Survival vest (as required). 18.7.1.8.  Overt/IR chemlights (as required). 18.7.1.9.  IR compatible flashlight (as required). 18.7.1.10.  Cloth Tape  -  For NVG operations, position sufficient  layers of cloth  tape on the  refueling  panel  light.    For  those  aircraft  so  equipped,  tape  the  dump  pump  light  as well.  Taping these lights is required to reduce the amount of light, not to eliminate the light (Not required for NVIS modified aircraft). 18.8.  Weather  Requirements  (T-1).  For training operations and exercises, stop fuel servicing when high winds or reduced visibility caused by blowing rain, snow, or sand exists or when an electrical  storm  is  within  a  5  mile  radius  of  the  hot  refueling  site.    Contact  the  local  weather agency for observations and/or forecasts for potential mission impacting weather phenomena. 18.9.  Safety (T-1).  Because of the inherent dangers with the ground refueling and rearming of aircraft,  safety  cannot  be  overemphasized.    Safety  is  the  responsibility  of  all  personnel  and  is considered  before,  during,  and  after  all  refueling  operations.    Any  person  observing  an  unsafe situation, practice, or procedure should immediately inform  all personnel, and all refueling and rearming operations will immediately stop until the unsafe condition can be eliminated. 18.9.1.  Safety guidance.  Hot refueling aircraft have been tailored to perform this unique and risky  operation.    Each  aircraft  and  the  refueling  equipment  involved  in  the  operation  was subjected  to  a  System  Safety  Engineering  Analysis  (SSEA),  which  includes;  a  failure mode/effects  criticality  assessments,  and  operating/support  hazard  analysis.    This  process considers  the  weapon  system,  support  equipment  and  the  personnel  interface.    Overall,  the system safety approach minimizes the hazards associated with this operation, reducing them to an acceptable level. 18.9.1.1.  Electrostatic  discharge.    Energy  levels  associated  with  electrostatic  discharge are several times the energy required to ignite fuel vapors.  A charge of static electricity can  accumulate  from  fuel  flowing  through  piping,  hoses,  couplers,  and  nozzles.  Operating  aircraft  engines,  rotor  blades,  and  propeller  blades  also  generate  high  static electricity  voltages.    The  normal  activity  of  personnel  involved  in  refueling  operations can generate static electricity on their clothing.  Humidity greatly affects static electricity characteristics,  the  lower  the  humidity,  the  higher  electrostatic  potential.    Under  low humidity  conditions,  flight  suits  can  produce  a  static  charge  of  sufficient  potential  to cause a discharge.  Anti-static finishes are not permanent and are gradually removed by laundering  or  dry  cleaning.    In  addition,  anti-static  finishes  are  not  effective  in  low humidity  conditions  or  at  low  temperatures.    To  equalize  these  charges  and  reduce  the possibility  of  sparks,  aircraft  and  refueling  equipment  are  bonded  to  each  other.    The   198  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 electrical bonding of refueling servicing equipment and aircraft is a critical item because aircraft are not normally grounded for this operation. 18.9.1.2.  If a ground is not available at a FOL or remote site, aircraft will be bonded to servicing equipment during actual servicing.  Bonding will be accomplished by inserting the bonding plug into the receiver aircraft’s external receptacle prior to any other action. 18.9.1.3.  In the event of static discharge, forward the following data to HQ ACC/A3TW following all hot refueling operations: type aircraft involved, OAT, dew point, humidity, engines  running  /  low  speed  /  shutdown,  taxiway  /  runway  surface,  indication  of discharge, and sequence followed when bonding / grounding. 18.9.2.  Fire  Protection.  Fire  protection  equipment  is  available  IAW  paragraph  18.3.3 Personnel involved in servicing operations will be trained in portable fire extinguishers and installed equipment fire suppression system operations. 18.9.3.  Heat  exhaustion  and  carbon  monoxide  inhalation.    Heat  exhaustion  and  carbon monoxide  inhalation,  although  not  serious  problems  are  two  factors  that  can  affect  a  crews ability to perform at their peak.  You can suffer heat exhaustion or minor burns from the heat of the engines combined with wind conditions.  You may also inhale carbon monoxide from the engine exhausts.  The following  are suggestions of how to  minimize the effects  of heat and carbon monoxide if the tactical situation will permit: 18.9.3.1.  Keep  drinking  water  available,  and  drink  large  quantities  of  water  to  help prevent dehydration. 18.9.3.2.  Raising  the  aircraft  flaps  may  reduce  the  exhaust  being  placed  on  the loadmaster.  Using the aircraft engine oil cooler augmentation (if available) may reduce the  exhaust  behind  the  aircraft.    Wind  direction,  temperature,  location  and  environment are all factors to be considered. 18.9.4.  Uses of 100 percent nylon garments.  The wear of Gortex ® or equivalent (The use of  the  name  or  mark  of  any  specific  manufacturer,  commercial  product,  commodity,  or service  in  this  publication  does  not  imply  endorsement  by  the  Air  Force)  is  authorized  for aircraft  servicing  with  JP-5/8/10,  Jet-A,  and  diesel  fuel  (including  mixed  fuel  criteria).   Personnel  will  not  wear  Gortex  within  50-feet  when  servicing  aircraft  with  JP-4  or  ground servicing with mobility gas (MOGAS). 18.9.5.  General  Ordnance  Procedures.    Aircraft  may  be  hot  refueled  with  live  ordnance aboard,  however  upload/download  of  ordnance  and  refueling  of  aircraft  will  normally  be conducted as separate operations; a separate area should be established at least 300 feet from the  hot  refueling  site.    During  combat  or  contingency  operations,  concurrent  refueling  and upload/download  of  ordnance  may  be  authorized  when,  in  the  judgment  of  the  mission commander,  operational  necessity  and  benefits  of  reducing  ground  time  outweigh  the  risks involved. 18.10.  Electronic Emissions: 18.10.1.  Inertial navigational systems (INS or INU) may remain energized. 18.10.2.  Restrictions: AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   199  18.10.2.1.  Radar,  radar  altimeters,  Doppler  or  DVS,  and  ECM  equipment  will  not  be operated within the refueling area. 18.10.2.2.

Interphone  discipline  is  essential  so  emergency  calls may  be  relayed  clearly.    NOTE:    All  unnecessary  voice  communication  is  prohibited  for safety  reasons.    Voice  communication  contact  between  the  loadmaster  and  cockpit  will  be maintained at all times. EXCEPTION:  The loadmaster does not have to maintain interphone contact  while  positioning/repositioning  refueling  equipment,  but  will  be  on  interphone  any time the refueling nozzle is connected to the aircraft and the switches on the SPR panel are in a position other than off or closed. 18.11.  Aircraft Marshaling:  (T-1) 18.11.1.  When  CCT/STS  are  responsible  for  primary  air  traffic  control  of  an  airfield,  they will  marshal  and  control  all  aircraft  movement  into  the  hot  refueling  site.    If  CCT/STS  are not available, all aircraft are responsible for self-marshaling into the hot refueling site. 18.11.2.  Aircraft commanders must ensure marshaling procedures are thoroughly prebriefed between  all  agencies  involved  prior  to  hot  refueling  operations.    These  procedures  must  be strictly adhered to at all times, to ensure all safety requirements are met. 18.12.  Emergency  Procedures.  (T-1) Hot  Refueling/FARP  Emergency  procedures  are published  in  the  amplified  checklist  and  abbreviated  checklist.    They  will  be  reviewed  by  all crewmembers  and  briefed  by  the  PIC  prior  to  commencing  hot  refueling  operations.    All personnel,  including  ground  controllers,  will  know  the  ground  evacuation  plans.    Stop  all  hot refueling operations immediately  when  a leak,  unsafe  condition,  or system malfunction occurs.  Correct the deficiency before resuming hot refueling operations. 18.13.  Checklists.  Amplified  HOT  REFUELING/FARP  Checklists  are  published in Attachment  4.    Checklists  are  applicable  to  those  aircraft  equipped  with  and  without  the UARRSI  modification.    Items  (i.e.  aircraft  systems,  checklist  items,  crew  positions)  in  the checklist  which  are  not  applicable  to  a  unit’s  particular  weapon  system  may  be  lined  out  in pencil. Section 18C—FARP Specific Guidance 18.14.  Forward  Area  Refueling  Point  (FARP).  The  following  paragraphs  provide  general guidelines  for  HC-130  FARP  operations,  in  preplanned  and  contingency  operations.    The  HC-130 can conduct single point FARP operations.  The scope of flight operations in the FARP area should include, but not be limited to individual aircraft, sections, or divisions of aircraft requiring refueling.  The  guidance  in  this  section  supplements  the  procedures  in  TO  00-25-172,  Ground Servicing  and  Static  Grounding/Bonding;  TO  37A9-7-2-1,  Operations  Maintenance  and Illustrated Parts Breakdown FAM Cart; AFI 11-235, Forward Area Refueling Point Operations; and  AFFTP  3-3.HC-130.    All  guidance  and  restrictions  applicable  to  Hot  Refueling  are   200  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 applicable  to  FARP,  unless  stated  otherwise  in  this  AFI  or  other  referenced  publications.  Deviations from the procedures contained in this chapter must be approved by MAJCOM/A3. 18.14.1.  Forward  Area  Refueling  Point  (FARP)  is  a  tactical  aircraft-to-aircraft  ground refueling operation that can be performed by HC-130 with engines running to a fixed-/rotary- wing aircraft or fuel bladders/vehicles.  FARP may be used to extend the combat radius/loiter time of receiver aircraft.  FARP is normally conducted at night in austere environments with engines  running  and  includes  fuel  transfer  from  aircraft  wing/fuselage  tanks  through  the single-point  refueling  panel  to  receiver  fixed  or  rotary-wing  aircraft  single  point  refueling panel  (if  applicable).    All  equipment  and  personnel  required  to  set-up  the  FARP  site  are assigned to the tanker aircraft. 18.14.2.  Ensure the FARP site is approved IAW AFI 11-235, Forward Area Refueling Point Operations,  and  meets  the  requirements  of  TO  00-25-172,  Ground  Servicing  and  Static Grounding/Bonding. 18.14.3.  Ensure  all  Air  Force  personnel  involved  are  trained  IAW  approved  IAW  AFI  11-235, Forward Area Refueling Point Operations and appropriate command directives. 18.14.4.  Maintenance  of  FARP  Equipment  for  ACC  Units.  Refer  to  AFI  11-235  and T.O. 37A9-7-2-1. 18.15.  FARP Crew Complement (T-1).  Only certified and current crewmembers will occupy a  primary  crew  position  during  FARP  operations.  EXCEPTION:    Crewmembers  in  training under  the  supervision  of  a  current  and  qualified  instructor.    Normally  these  missions  will  be conducted  with  a  NVG  tactical/operational  crew.  The  minimum  crew  required  to  deploy  and operate a FARP will be as follows: 18.15.1.  Pilot – 2 (only the PIC is required to be FARP certified) 18.15.2.  Flight engineer – 1 18.15.3.  Navigator – 1 18.15.4.  Hot Refueling Supervisor (Loadmaster) – 1 18.15.5.  Panel Operator (Loadmaster) 1 18.15.6.  Hose Deployment Personnel (2FOXl/AMSS/ Loadmaster) - one per refueling point 18.16.  Crew Duties and Responsibilities (T-1).  NOTE:  The pilot, copilot, and flight engineer will  remain  on  the  flight  deck  in  the  event  of  an  emergency  taxi,  i.e.  moving  the  aircraft.  Amplified HOT REFUELING/FARP Checklists are published in Attachment 4. 18.16.1.  Hose  Deployment  Personnel  (HDP).  (T-1)  Properly  trained  Aircrew  AMSS  or Loadmasters will perform HDP in lieu of Air Force fuels personnel (AFSC 2FOXl) and will be included in the FARP to deploy/redeploy fuel hoses.  Minimum HDPs will be one person for  each  receiver  point.    The  personnel  designated  as  HDPs  will  deploy  hoses  from  the aircraft  and  set  up  the  refueling  points.    WARNING:    HDPs  (2FOXl)  will  not  be  used  to marshal  aircraft.    NOTE:    For  the  HC-130  to  conduct  FARP  operations  without  an  HDP trained USAF  fuels  personnel  (AFSC 2FOXI) as part of the crew compliment,  the receiver aircraft must deplane a crew member to connect the refueling nozzle and refuel the aircraft.   LM and AMSS certified as HDP are not authorized to perform these duties. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   201  18.16.2.  Hot Refueling Supervisor (HRS) Duties (T-1): 18.16.2.1.  The HRS is responsible for supervising fuel servicing operations. 18.16.2.2.  Ensures that all personnel are properly briefed on fueling procedures. 18.16.2.3.

The HRS will brief who will operate the ramp and door, paratroop door, and canary slides/ground loading ramps.  The HRS, upon landing and after clearance from the pilot,  will open the  cargo ramp  and door to  12 inches  above horizontal position.  Upon clearance from the pilot to offload the HRS will lower the cargo ramp to the ground.  The HRS will exit the aircraft through the ramp and door to perform the hot brake /hung flare checks and to clear personnel off the aircraft to establish the FARP site.  NOTE:  During hose deployment, the HRS will assist the HDP deploying the hoses. 18.16.2.7.  Instructs the PO when to dispense or shutoff fuel flow by interphone or hand signals, monitors for fuel leaks and periodically scans the tanker wings.  The HRS will be positioned so as to have an unobstructed view of the entire operation. 18.16.2.8.  In  the  event  of  a  hazardous  situation/emergency,  the  HRS  will  immediately inform the pilot and advise the crew on recommended course of action. 18.16.2.9.  The HRS assists with the tear down of the FARP equipment upon completion, the PO will assumes primary interphone contact. 18.16.3.  Panel Operator (PO) (Tanker operations) duties (T-1): 18.16.3.1.  Will  operate  the  SPR  panel.  The  flight  engineer  will  control  the  fuel distribution by use of dump pumps. The PO will also be HRS qualified. 18.16.3.2.  The PO will open the right paratroop door. 18.16.3.3.  The PO will position an inter-phone cord near the right paratroop door. 18.16.3.4.  Upon  clearance  from  the  HRS,  the  PO  and  HDP  will  exit  the  aircraft  and deploy  the  tanker  end  of  the  refueling  hose  towards  the  SPR  panel.    WARNING:  Bonding  will  be  accomplished  by  inserting  the  bonding  plug  from  the  refueling  nozzle into the aircraft’s external receptacle prior to any other action. 18.16.3.5.  The  PO  connects  the  SPR  nozzle  to  the  SPR  receptacle  IAW  applicable directives, and monitors the refueling hose to prevent HDP from possibly damaging the hose/connector.  Once  hose  layout  is  complete,  position  fire  extinguisher  and  water container next to the SPR panel.  The PO connects to the prepositioned inter-phone cord. 18.16.3.6.  The  right  paratroop  door  will  remain  open  during  hot  refueling  operations.  CAUTION:  In the event the aircraft must depart immediately, the PO will shut down the SPR panel using the offload valve only and disconnect the SPR nozzle. 18.16.3.7.  Perform leak check at SPR panel.   202  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 18.16.3.8.  The PO assumes primary interphone contact when the HRS assists the HDPs in evacuating hoses/tear down. 18.16.3.9.  To drain  the  residual fuel  from  the refueling hoses, pressure  will be relieved from the refueling hose IAW applicable directives. 18.16.3.10.  Setup  the  SPR  panel  IAW  this  AFI.  EXCEPTION:  On  UARRSI  modified aircraft the FE will control the SPR drain pump. 18.16.3.11.  After  all  hoses  have  been  rolled/stowed  to  the  low  (suction)  side  of  the pump, turn the pump off and disconnect the hose.  The 10’ section can be evacuated by use  of  the  SPR  drain  pump  and  holding  the  hose  overhead.    Some  residual  fuel  will remain in this section of hose. The PO turns off the refueling panel and disconnects the SPR nozzle. 18.16.3.12.  Secure aircraft for departure after all equipment and personnel are aboard. 18.17.  Hose  Deployment  from  FARP  sled  or  Aircraft  Floor/Ramp.  (T-1)  WARNING:  Refueling hoses will only be pulled from over the shoulder while running/walking forward, not backwards.    CAUTION:    While  deploying  hoses,  after  sufficient  resistance  is  met,  lay  down hoses and return to the aircraft for another length. Repeat this step as necessary until positioning is complete. Minimize the dragging of connections/valves to prevent damage. 18.17.1.  HDP/HRSs will walk the length of the hoses back to the aircraft checking for kinks, twists, and dry break positions. 18.17.2.  After walking the hoses, the HDPs will notify the HRS with a thumbs up signal that the  line  check  is  complete.    HDPs  will  return  to  the  aircraft  for  the  fire  extinguishers  and water  containers  and  return  to  the  refueling  nozzle  end.    Position  a  fire  extinguisher  at  the refueling point.  Position water canister at 200’ dry break connection. The HDP will wait for fuel pressurization to the points. 18.17.3.  When the hoses are pressurized, perform leak check. 18.17.4.  HDPs  will  remain  at  the  refueling  point  to  act  as  fire  guard  after  passing  the refueling  nozzle  to  the  receiver  crewmember.    WARNING:    HDPs  will  not  be  used  to marshal aircraft IAW AFI 11-235.  WARNING:  Bonding will be accomplished by inserting the bonding plug from the refueling nozzle into the aircraft’s external receptacle prior to any other action. 18.17.5.  After the completion of FARP, the HDPs will position themselves at the refueling point  to  drain  the  hose.  Stretch  hoses  to  their  full  length,  starting  at  the  receiver  SPR/CCR nozzle, and attach the squeegee, to squeegee that segment of hose. After squeeging the length of hose and reaching a connection, evacuate fuel from hose by briefly opening the valve, then close both sides of the valve and disconnect hose. Install dust caps. Stow/Roll that segment of  hose.  Repeat  steps  for  each  section  of  hose.    Return  hoses  to  the  FARP  sled  or  aircraft floor.  NOTE:  Squeegees should be used to drain hoses. When squeegees are not available, walking and rolling the hoses will suffice as an alternate method of draining.  This alternate method will leave more  residual fuel  in  the hoses and will increase tear  down time.  When reaching the fittings, raise the hose and let fuel drain from the fitting into the next hose, close both valves while in raised position. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   203  18.17.6.  Two personnel are required to drain each section of hose.  One installs and pulls the squeegee, and the other holds the hose. The person holding the hose will then start rolling the hose. 18.18.  Typical  Single  Point  FARP  Configuration.  (T-1)  The  single  point  FARP  set-up  will be  configured  on  the  aircraft  ramp  for  ease  and  rapid  deployment.    Required  support/safety equipment will be configured near the right paratroop door for convenient access by the PO.  See Figures 18.1 and 18.2 for typical set-up.

(T-1)  Dropsonde  airdrops  will  be  conducted  using zero percent  flaps, between 170  and 180 KIAS,  using only the cargo door.  This  configuration will prevent the dropsonde from striking the tail of the aircraft.  Loadmasters will open the cargo door from the aft control panel for dropsonde airdrops.  If a designated PADS operator (PO) is not on board, the navigator will perform PO duties and make all calls as the navigator. CAUTION:  (T-1)  When  tactical  situation  allows,  open  the  cargo  door  before  climbing  above 15,000  feet.    When  airdropping  following  a  high  altitude  transition  (e.g.  extended  high  level flight  to  a  high  altitude  airdrop)  above  10,000  feet  MSL,  turn  on  the  auxiliary  pump  prior  to depressurization and set aircraft depressurization rate to 1,000 FPM.  This time must be factored into  the  drop  sequence  to  ensure  the  aircraft  is  completely  depressurized  prior  to  opening  the cargo door.  If the auxiliary pump stalls during cargo door activation (indicated by a loud audible whine  or  a  pressure  reading  below  1,000  PSI),  allow  system  pressure  to  recover  by  stopping opening  or  closing  action.    During  unexpected  delays  it  is  recommend  the  auxiliary  pump  be turned  off  to  prevent  overheating.      The  risk  of  pump  overheating  must  be  weight  against  the need to rapidly close the cargo door and evade threats.       TWENTY MINUTE CHECKLIST PILOT/CREW DROPSONDE AIRDROP CHECKLIST  1.

Parachutists Condition – “PARACHUTIST RELEASED” or "INDICATES  (LM)  CONSCIOUS / UNCONSCIOUS"     NOTE:  (T-1) The jumpmaster/safety observer is responsible for watching the fouled parachutist to determine how the parachutist is entangled.  If being towed by anything other than the static line, the jumpmaster or safety will attempt to free the parachutist.  If being towed by the static line, the jumpmaster/ safety observer will recommend to the pilot, through the loadmaster, whether to retrieve or cut the parachutist free.  If all parachutists have exited and there is no safety on board, this responsibility rests with the loadmaster.  The pilot makes the final decision whether to retrieve or cut the parachutist free.  The loadmaster will initiate retrieval or cut the parachutist’s static line on the pilot’s command.  NOTE: (T-1) The parachutist will indicate consciousness and that a reserve parachute is ready by maintaining a tight body position with both hands on the reserve.  5.

Status of Parachutist – “RELEASED/RETRIEVED”     8.  “MALFUNCTION CHECKLIST COMPLETE”   9.  Perform Completion of Drop Checklist    (LM) (LM)   A2.7.  Paratroop  Door  Emergency  Parachutist  Retrieval  Procedures.  There  are  three methods of retrieval for towed parachutist from the left/right paratroop door of the HC/MC-130 aircraft.  The  primary  retrieval  is  the  Towed  Paratrooper  Retrieval  System  (TPRS).    The secondary method is with the paratroop retrieval bar for aircraft equipped with this system.  The third  method  is  to  rig  a  5,000  lb.  tie-down  strap  in  the  paratroop  door  prior  to  retrieval.    See Tables A2.1 through A2.3 NOTE:  (T-1) The maximum allowable weight for a towed paratrooper, without the TPRS, for paratroop door exit is 250 pounds. The limit is 400 pounds when utilizing TPRS (does not apply to combat or actual contingency missions).  Jumpmasters are responsible for parachutist weight restrictions. Use of the Retrieval Sling Assembly without the roller assembly is authorized for retrieving static lines only.  The Retrieval Sling Assembly together with the Roller Assembly will be used for retrieval of a towed parachutist. Table A2.1.  Towed Parachutist Retrieval System (TPRS) (T-1). 1.  Install retriever assist strap (RAS/roller system) around static line(s) under retriever sling assembly ensuring quick-snap fittings are re-connected between "A" frame center anchor cable support and anchor cable stop at FS 770 on outboard anchor cable. 2.  Install retriever sling assembly around parachutist static line(s) and pull sling loop tight with retrieval sling hook 3.  Fold in jump platform and initiate retrieval.  a.  If the aircraft has been modified with the slip clutch assembly to the static line retriever winch, engage static line retriever winch until it slips.  If the retriever clutch slips prior to bringing the parachutist into the paratroop door area, determine and remove the cause of the overload, slightly unwind the static line retriever winch to reset the winch’s slip clutch, and continue retrieval operation.  WARNING: During retrieval attempts, take all possible action to ensure the parachutist does not slip back at any time.  This does not preclude unwinding the static line retriever to reset the slip clutch, if necessary.       b. Stop retrieval when the cotton sleeve at the apex of the D-bags begins to pass through the RAS. 4.  As the parachutist is pulled up to the door, swing parachutist into the aircraft by hand, close and secure paratroop door. AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   245        a. If the parachutist is not in the paratroop door, (e.g., positioned in the lower aft corner of the paratroop door) it will become necessary to pull the D-bags manually through the RAS. The primary loadmaster maintains control of the static line retriever pistol grip.  The secondary loadmaster (if available) or safety observer/jumpmaster (if also onboard) routes D-bags through the RAS.  WARNING: All personnel should remain clear of the paratroop door and line of travel of the static line retriever cable until the parachutist has been retrieved into the door.       b. After D-bags have been brought into the aircraft, manually pull them far enough forward so as not to interfere with the remaining retrieval.       c. As the parachutist is pulled up to the paratroop door, swing parachutist into the aircraft by hand, close and lock paratroop door.  5.  After retrieving the parachutist, reset flaps to 50 percent, raise the landing gear, and accomplish the completion of drop checklist.  Table A2.2.  Paratroop Retrieval Bar  (T-1). 1.  Install the parachutist retrieval bar in the paratroop door. One end of the bar is inserted in the retaining bracket on the aft portion of the door frame. The other end of the bar is then carefully raised and inserted on the forward portion on the door frame. 2.  Fold in the jump platform. 3.  Using the static line retriever, retrieve the static lines over the bar. 4.  The loadmaster initiates retrieval using the static line retriever winch. WARNING: During retrieval attempts, take all possible action to ensure the parachutist does not slip back at any time. This does not preclude unwinding the static line retriever to reset the slip clutch, if necessary. a.  Stop retrieval when the cotton sleeve at the apex of the D-bags begins to pass over the  paratroop retrieval bar. 5.  As the parachutist is pulled up to the door, swing parachutist into the aircraft by hand.  a.  If the parachutist is not in the paratroop door, (e.g., positioned in the lower aft corner of the paratroop door) it will become necessary to pull the D-bags manually through the opening between the retrieval bar and the paratroop door.  The primary loadmaster maintains control of the static line retriever pistol grip.  The secondary loadmaster (if available) or safety observer/jumpmaster (if also onboard) routes the D-bags through the opening. WARNING:  All personnel should remain clear of the paratroop door and line of travel of the static line retriever cable until the parachutist has been retrieved into the door.  Once D-bags have been brought into the aircraft, manually pull them far enough forward so as not to interfere   246  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 with the remaining retrieval. NOTE: When the parachutist is in the door area and is being controlled by the loadmaster/safety observer/jumpmaster, slightly unwind the static line retriever to relieve tension on the static line so the parachutist may be brought into the aircraft. 6.  After retrieving the parachutist accomplish the completion of drop checklist. Table A2.3.  5,000 lb Tie-down Strap (T-1). 1.  The loadmaster folds the jump platform in. 2.  Install a 5,000 lb. tie-down strap across the paratroop door by threading the hook end of the strap behind the one-inch tubular brace located at FS 737, across the door under all static lines, and behind the one-inch tubular brace at FS 700. Secure the hook end of the tie-down strap to a tie-down ring forward of FS 700 and ratchet end to any convenient tie-down ring aft of FS 737. Remove as much slack as possible. WARNING: Use extreme caution when routing 5,000 lb. strap over the oxygen regulators located at FS 740 left and right side. 3.  Push the static lines to the top of the paratroop door and remove additional slack in the tie-down strap by using the ratchet. 4.  Follow the procedures as indicated in the paratroop retrieval bar method starting with Step 3. A2.8.  Cargo Ramp and Door Emergency Parachutist Retrieval Procedures.  (T-1)  WARNING:  The maximum weight of parachutists dropped off the ramp during training is 325 pounds.  Jumpmasters are responsible for parachutist weight restrictions. NOTE:  It will be necessary to partially retrieve the static line with the static line retriever to reach the line for cutting. If the parachutist does not signal, cannot be observed, or a condition exists that prevents cutting the static line, implement emergency retrieval procedures. Table A2.4.  Aircraft Not Modified with Quick-Retrieval Tiedown Rings (T-1). 1.  Thread the hook end of a 5,000 lb. tie-down strap, front to rear, around the right vertical support member at FS 840 approximately 5 1/2 feet above the ramp in the ADS position. 2.  Attach the hook end into the strap and draw taut. 3.  Run the ratchet end of the strap across the ramp and thread it, front to rear, around the left vertical -support member at FS 840. 4.  Remove all slack from the strap and attach the ratchet end to any convenient tie-down ring forward of FS 840. Ratchet the strap until taut. 5.  Using the static line retriever retrieve the static lines over the strap and as the parachutist is pulled up to the ramp, bring parachutist into the aircraft by hand under the strap. WARNING: The last 5 feet are the most crucial for the fouled parachutist.  A wildly oscillating parachutist usually strikes the aircraft ramp head first.  If the parachutist is oscillating violently, it may become necessary to stop the retrieval momentarily, allowing the parachutist to stabilize, AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   247  then continue with the retrieval.  Repeat these stops continually, if required. NOTE: After the parachutist is pulled up to the ramp and is being controlled by the jumpmaster/safety observer/loadmaster, slightly unwind the static line retriever to relieve tension on the line so the parachutist may be brought into the aircraft. 6. After retrieving the parachutist, accomplish the completion of drop checklist. CAUTION:  For aircraft equipped with ramp air deflectors, after the jumper has been successfully retrieved and secured, remove the 5000 pound strap prior to closing the aft cargo door and ramp.  Failure to do so will cause the ramp air deflectors to contact the strap causing damage to the aircraft or the strap to break. Table A2.5.  Aircraft Modified with Quick-Retrieval Tie-down Rings (T-1). 1.  Attach hook end of the pre-positioned 5,000-pound tie-down strap facing forward to the tie-down ring on the side of the aircraft from which the parachutist is being towed. Attach the ratchet end of the tie-down strap to the opposite tie-down ring and ratchet until two turns of webbing are around the spindle and strap is taut. 2.  Emergency retrieval tie-down strap will be pre-measured and excess taped prior to takeoff. S-fold the excess strap and tape near the ratchet end of the strap with pressure-sensitive tape.    Pre-measure strap so with both ends connected to the tie-down rings and two wraps around the spindle, the excess strap remains securely taped.  Pre-position strap so that it is accessible if needed prior to take-off. 3. Using the static-line retriever retrieve the static lines over the strap and as the parachutist is pulled up to the ramp, bring the parachutist into the aircraft by hand underneath the strap. WARNING:  The last five feet are the most crucial for the fouled parachutist.  A wildly oscillating parachutist usually strikes the aircraft ramp head first.  If the parachutist is oscillating violently, it may become necessary to stop the retrieval momentarily, allowing the parachutist to stabilize, then continue with the retrieval.  Repeat these stops continually, if required. NOTE:  After the parachutist is pulled up to the ramp and is being controlled by the jumpmaster/safety observer/loadmaster, slightly unwind the static line retriever to relieve tension in the line so the parachutist may be brought into the aircraft. A2.9.  Manual Static Line Retrieval Procedures.  During combat, cut static lines which cannot be retrieved. On other than combat missions, if the static line retriever fails during retrieval and more than 10 static lines are to be retrieved from the paratroop door, manually retrieve the static lines by using a 5,000 lb tie-down strap. Table A2.6.  Manual Static Line Retrieval Procedures (Paratroop Door) (T-1).  1.  Secure the hook end to a point forward enough in the cargo compartment to permit static lines to enter completely into the aircraft.    248  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015 2.  Insert the other end of the strap from the bottom up, making a "U" around the static lines.  3.  Pull the strap forward to retrieve the static lines into the aircraft. Loadmasters may require assistance to pull the strap forward.  Table A2.7.  Manual Static Line Retrieval Procedures (Ramp and Door) (T-1). NOTE:  If the static line retriever fails following a combination/tailgate drop, use the following procedures using the Prusik Knot (see Figure A2.1.). 1.  Take a 30 inch piece of 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord that is tied in a loop.  Loop the cord around the static line retriever winch cable.  Use a minimum of three wraps around the retriever cable to ensure locking of the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord.  2.  Pull to tighten the knot around the retriever winch cable to prevent slipping.  Attach the hook end of a 5,000 lb. tie-down strap into the loop’s end and pull in the static lines.  The 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord will remain locked in place under tension.  3.  More than one 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord may be attached to the winch cable using the Prusik Knot to facilitate static line retrieval.  The Prusik Knot may be adjusted up or down the cable as required.  The knot will not slip as long as it is wrapped tightly with a minimum of three turns (more wraps equal more friction), and tension is applied.  4.  To prevent cutting the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord with the hook on the 5,000 lb. tie-down strap, a carabineer may be attached to the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord loop and the hook attached to carabineer.

Aft Anchor Cable Supports – Raised (As required).  4.  “CLEAR TO CLOSE RAMP AND DOOR”   WARNING: (T-1) The loadmaster will ensure that the restraint harness lifeline is attached to a point no further aft than FS 677 prior to proceeding aft to operate the ramp and door controls.  (LM)     AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015   257  CAUTION:  (T-1)If the containers are jammed in the ramp area, the loadmaster will notify the engineer to stop closing action when the cargo door is released from the uplocks.  After the load is secured and the ramp area is clear, the loadmaster will close the ramp and door from the aft control panel (if possible).  NOTE:  Notify the engineer when closed and locked.  5.  Bundle(s) – Secured  6.  Pilot Notified – "MALFUNCTION CHECKS COMPLETE"   7.  Accomplish the COMPLETION OF DROP Checklist. (LM) A2.12.  (T-1)  Dropsonde  Checklist  (Loadmaster).  Dropsonde  airdrops  will  be  conducted using  zero  percent  flaps,  between  170  and  180  KIAS,  using  only  the  cargo  door.    This configuration will prevent the dropsonde from striking the tail of the aircraft.  Loadmasters will open the cargo door from the aft control panel for dropsonde airdrops. CAUTION:  (T-1)  When  tactical  situation  allows,  open  the  cargo  door  before  climbing  above 15,000  feet.    When  airdropping  following  a  high  altitude  transition  (e.g.  extended  high  level flight  to  a  high  altitude  airdrop)  above  10,000  feet  MSL,  turn  on  the  auxiliary  pump  prior  to depressurization and set aircraft depressurization rate to 1,000 FPM.  This time must be factored into  the  drop  sequence  to  ensure  the  aircraft  is  completely  depressurized  prior  to  opening  the cargo door.  If the auxiliary pump stalls during cargo door activation (indicated by a loud audible whine  or  a  pressure  reading  below  1,000  PSI),  allow  system  pressure  to  recover  by  stopping opening  or  closing  action.    During  unexpected  delays  it  is  recommend  the  auxiliary  pump  be turned  off  to  prevent  overheating.      The  risk  of  pump  overheating  must  be  weight  against  the need to rapidly close the cargo door and evade threats.  TWENTY-MINUTE CHECKLIST  LOADMASTER DROPSONDE AIRDROP CHECKLIST 1.

Aft Restraint – Removed (As required)  WARNING: (T-1)    Upon hearing a "No Drop" call, the PM will turn the red light on and, along with the loadmaster, acknowledge the "No Drop."  If the CRL is held in place by only the release gate strap, all personnel on the cargo ramp will move forward of forward most load, except the (P/CP)   276  AFI11-2HC-130V3  28 APRIL 2015     (LM/JM) loadmaster and jumpmaster who will monitor the CRL for possible shifting and secure as necessary.  6.  "SAFETY CHECKS COMPLETE"   WARNING: (T-2)   Jumpmasters will run their Safety Checklist.  The loadmaster is responsible for accomplishing all other appropriate checklists and overall safety in the cargo compartment. When either the loadmaster or jumpmaster responds "Safety Check Complete," this indicates that both the personnel/equipment and safetyman checklists have been completed on all jumpers exiting on this pass.  WARNING:  (T-2)  Each jumper will be responsible for monitoring their own static line. EXCEPTION:  The loadmaster will hold the jumpmaster’s static line if the jumpmaster is exiting from a paratroop door on the pass.  The loadmaster will monitor the jumpmaster’s static line at all times unless preparing the CRL or equipment for deployment.  Jumpmasters will remove their reserve parachute and connect their static line clip to their parachute harness (the static line will not be connected to the anchor cable) prior to spotting from the aft edge of the ramp.  An aircraft personnel restraint cable will be connected to D-ring on the jumpmaster’s parachute.  WARNING: (T-2)   During paratroop door static line drops, personnel will not position themselves directly under the center anchor cable supports (A-frame, FS 737).  Personnel in the cargo compartment during tailgate drops will not position themselves below the static line retriever cable while the cargo ramp and door are open.  7.  "CLEAR TO JUMP"   WARNING:  (T-1)  When the pilot responds "Clear to Jump," this indicates that all conditions are favorable for personnel deployment.

Remember that the LM, HRS and PO is the eyes  and  ears  of  the  crew  during  all  hot  refueling  operations.    Escape  routes  should  be established for each aircraft in the event of an emergency.  The escape route should be depicted on the hot refueling site survey and must be reviewed prior to the mission.  Crews must monitor radios  to  ensure they  receive any  evacuation call and must be ready  to  break  radio  silence  and notify other participants in the event they experience an emergency.
