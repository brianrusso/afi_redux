It carries out the tenets of DoDDirective 1100.20, Support and Services for Eligible Organizations and Activities Outside the Depart-ment of Defense, dated 30 January 1997; and Section 2012 of Title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.).Ensure that all records created by this instruction are maintained and disposed of IAW AFMAN 37-139,Records Disposition Schedule.1. Policy1.1.

The list of eligible non-DoD organizations and activitiesare designated in USC Title 10, Section 508 as:  Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Boys Clubs, YMCA,YWCA, CAP, US Olympic Committee, Special Olympics or any other entity approved by the Secre-tary of Defense.  The Directive does not authorize the use of units and personnel for civilian lawenforcement purposes nor for response to natural or manmade disasters. 1.2. Civic and community assistance provided shall be accomplished through IRT activities, and shallbe accomplished primarily, but not exclusively, by personnel in the areas of healthcare services, trans-portation, general engineering, and infrastructure support and assistance.   1.3. Support and services provided under authority of Title 10, Section 2012, U.S.C. shall:1.3.1. Be consistent with the national policy of protecting military readiness and avoiding compe-tition with the private sector.2AFI36-2250   1 MARCH 19991.3.2. Be coordinated among the Military Departments and other Federal, State, and local agen-cies involved with the IRT Project/Activity to avoid duplication.1.3.3. Contribute, whenever possible and appropriate, to the protection and assurance of criticallocal, State, regional, and national infrastructure.   1.4. If a specific request for support and services is received, assistance may be provided only if:1.4.1. Assistance is requested by a responsible official of the eligible organization or activity towhich the assistance is to be provided.  A responsible official is an individual authorized to repre-sent the organization or activity regarding the matter of assistance to be provided.  Examplesinclude a request from a state agency, i.e., hospital, school, museum; the mayor of a city; or acounty government official.1.4.2. Unit officials must coordinate with civilian officials to ensure that assistance meets a validcommunity need and does not duplicate other available public services.  1.4.3. Assistance is not reasonably available from a commercial entity or, if available, the respon-sible official submitting the request for assistance certifies that the commercial entity that would otherwise provide such services agrees to the provision of such services by theArmed Forces.  The determination of reasonable availability of assistance from a commercialentity may take into account whether the requesting organization or activity would be able, finan-cially or otherwise, to address the specific civic or community need(s) without the assistance ofthe Armed Forces.  1.5. Assistance may be provided only if:1.5.1. The assistance provided accomplishes valid unit training requirements and the assistanceprovided complies with the policies, procedures, and responsibilities of the references in attach-ment one. 1.5.2.

The requirement that the military assistance must accomplish valid unit training does notapply in a case in which the unit assistance consists primarily of military manpower, and the totalamount of such assistance on a particular project does not exceed 100 man-hours.  In these partic-ular instances, most manpower requests will be met by volunteers, and that any assistance otherthan manpower will be extremely limited.  Government vehicles may be used, but only to providetransportation of personnel to and from the work site.  The use of military aircraft is prohibited.1.6. The provision of assistance shall not adversely affect the quality of training, or otherwise inter-fere with the ability of a member or unit of the Air Force to perform their military functions.1.6.1.

Civil-Military IRT funding, provided by OSD/RA, is intended to augment the Services/Components training costs for their military readiness mission that may be associated with aproject.  It is not intended to support significant overhead/management costs.  Any overhead costsneed to be directly correlated and combined with the specific IRT program/project in which it sup-ports and retained by each Service/Component in total or by each specific project at any organiza-tional level.  (Overhead is defined as funding in support of the overall Civil-Military InnovativeReadiness Training program, whether O & M, Milpers, or combined.) 3.2.2.

OASD/RA  provides MOAs to organizations at thebeginning of each fiscal year after overall project approval.  3.4. Reporting requirements during the project and upon project completion.  3.4.1. After-action reports are due 60 days after project completion and should include all budgetinformation for OSD/RA funded and unfunded projects; a summary of training completed; a sum-mary of the assistance provided; and copies of any media coverage on the assistance.  At a mini-mum, assess the degree to which completed IRT activities have contributed to individual and unitmission readiness and training, and whether the IRT activity addressed the intended community orcivic need(s).3.4.2. Costs shown in after-action reports must equal original submission or the report mustexplain why it doesn’t.3.4.3. Interim reports are not necessary for funded projects unless the project is interrupted, mod-ified,* or halted.   NOTE*  Send requests for modification by fax, email or telephone to OSD/RA,but don’t proceed with any modification until it is approved.  3.4.3.1. In this case, file reports within 30 days of project cessation.RUBY B.
