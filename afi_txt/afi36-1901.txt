Professional  Conduct.  The  first  impression  that  most  prospective  Airmen  receive  of  the Air  Force  is  through  contact  with  a  recruiter.    This  experience  is  a  critical  first  step  in  the development  of  prospective  Air  Force  members  because  the  recruiter  establishes  expectations about all aspects of life in the Air Force.   In addition, the relationship provides the prospective Airman  the  first  example  of  the  Air  Force  core  values  and  standards  of  conduct.    The  positive attitude,  approach  to  professionalism,  demonstration  of  proper  professional  relationships,  and reflection  of  the  Air  Force  core  values  by  recruiters  are  critical  to  shaping  new  Airmen.  Recruiters  must  be  familiar  with  the  standards  of  conduct  identified  in  AFI  1-1,  Air  Force Standards,  AFI  36-2909,  Professional  and  Unprofessional  Relationships  (especially  the provisions  specific  to  unprofessional  relationships  between  recruiters  and  recruits);  and,  DoD 5500.07-R,  Joint  Ethics  Regulation.    Recruiters  should  also,  based  on  their  knowledge  of  the listed  instructions,  be  prepared  to  be  the  model  of  professional  and  ethical  behavior  to prospective Airmen, applicants and recruits. 1.3.1.  Recruiting  personnel  are  defined  as  all  persons  assigned  to  the  Air  Force  recruiting program  including  personnel  assigned  to  the  Air  Force  Recruiting  Service,  wings,  groups, squadrons,  and  Geographically  Separated  Units  (GSUs)  regardless  of  their  duty  Air  Force Specialty Code (AFSC). 1.3.2.  Recruiting personnel have a duty to report actual or suspected recruiting malpractice, misconduct, or irregularities in the recruiting process to their immediate supervisor or higher as  required  by  the  nature  of  the  allegations  and/or  alleged  individual.

The  Recruiting  Service  Commander  or  equivalent,  will  initiate  or  upchannel,  as appropriate, inquiries into all  allegations of professional  conduct,  or complaints included in this  chapter  processed  according  to  the  appropriate  component  specific  Personnel  Services Delivery Guide (PSDG). 1.3.4.  Prospective  Member  of  the  Armed  Forces  or  Prospect  is  any  person  who  has expressed,  to  recruiting  personnel,  an  interest  in  enlisting  or  receiving  an  appointment  as  a commissioned  officer  in  a  Military  Service  and  who  appears  to  possess,  or  who  appears  to possess, or who may in the future possess, the potential and qualifications for enlistment or appointment  as  a  commissioned  officer  in  said  Military  Service.    An  individual  who expresses  a  loss  of  interest  in  enlistment  or  appointment  as  a  commissioned  officer  will continue to be a prospect for the purpose of this instruction for a period of one year from the date  they  express  this  loss  of  interest  to  recruiting  personnel.    Individuals  who  possess  the potential  or  qualifications  for  enlistment  or  appointment  in  the  future  may  include,  but  are not limited to individuals who do not meet the minimum age requirements, who scored too low on the qualification testing but will be eligible to retest, or who have not completed their education.    An  individual  who  expresses  an  interest  in  enlistment  or  appointment  as  a commissioned officer but is permanently barred under existing instructions is not a prospect. 1.4.  Recruiting  Malpractice.  Recruiters who take any act  to  conceal  or conspire to  conceal  a disqualifying  factor;  or  take  any  action  to  qualify  an  ineligible  applicant  in  violation  of directives,  have  committed  recruiting  malpractice.    Recruiting  malpractice  is  prohibited  and failure by military members to obey the mandatory provisions in paragraphs 1.4.1 through 1.4.7 8 AFI36-1901  20 JUNE 2017 is  a  violation  of  Article  92,  UCMJ.

Recruiters  will  not  advise  prospects,  applicants  or  recruits  regarding  the  transfer  of dependent custody or changing marital status for the purpose of entry into the Air Force. 1.4.6.  Recruiters will not participate in any other intentional violation of recruiting policy or procedure  that  results  in,  or  is  intended  to  result  in,  the  processing  or  enlistment, commissioning, or appointment of an ineligible applicant. 1.4.7.  Recruiters  will  not  sponsor  an  alien  for  permanent  residence  in  the  United  States  by citing  the  Air  Force  as  a  prospective  employer.    In  addition,  recruiting  personnel  will  not recruit  in  a  foreign  country  unless  invited  by  the  government  (specifically  Canada  and Mexico).  Some  countries  have  laws  forbidding  the  armed  forces  of  a  foreign  state  from recruiting in their country, such as Canada’s “Foreign Enlistment Act.” 1.5.  Recruiting  Misconduct  Recruiting  misconduct  is  defined  as  any  willful  or  intentional conduct  by  a  recruiter  contrary  to  this  paragraph  or  any  other  applicable  publication  that  is prejudicial to the good order and discipline of the Armed Forces, or of a nature that could bring discredit upon the Air Force.  Failure by military members to obey the mandatory provisions of paragraphs  1.5.1  through  1.5.3  is  a  violation  of  Article  92,  UCMJ.   ANG  members  in  Title  32 status are subject to their respective state military codes. Recruiting personnel will maintain high standards  of  conduct  and  be  totally  professional  in  their  relationships  with  applicants.  These prohibitions  apply  from  the  first  contact  between  a  prospect,  an  applicant  or  a  recruit  and  the recruiter  through  entry-level  training  and  for  six  months  after  the  trainee  completes  all  Initial Active Duty for Training (IADT) requirements. 1.5.1.  Recruiters will not  make statements to  a prospect,  applicant  or recruit that imply the Air Force will take legal action against an individual who refuses to enter active duty (AD) or extended active duty (EAD). 1.5.2.

Recruiters will not mislead or misinform a prospect or applicant regarding any aspect of  recruiting  policy,  procedures,  entitlements,  benefits,  or  any  intentional  misinformation designed to induce an applicant to apply for or accept enlistment, commissioning, assignment or appointment. 1.6.  Recruiting  Irregularity.  Irregularity  is  defined  as  any  other  recruiting  infraction  not covered under the purview of malpractice or misconduct.  This  includes  an unintentional  action that  causes  a  prospect  or  applicant  to  be  misinformed  about  any  aspect  of  the  recruiting  or enlistment process, policies, procedures, entitlements, and benefits. 1.6.1.

Overview.  Financial  Management  (FM)  is  the  process  of  determining  requirements, obtaining resources, and efficiently applying those resources to meet direct mission and support responsibilities.  Recruiting is  a unique career field  that enables  Recruiting  Personnel  to  utilize funds unlike traditional Air Force career fields, and it is imperative to use extreme diligence.  All Recruiting Personnel are responsible for appropriate management of their funds “outlined in the JTR,  Joint  Travel  Regulation  and  further  in  AFI  65-114,  Travel-Policy  and  Procedures  for Financial  Services  Offices  and  Finance  Offices-Reserve  Component.”  and  all  applicable  laws, regulations, and policies. 4.2.  Applicant Processing Expenses. 4.2.1.  Applicants  are  entitled  to  travel  at  government  expense  to  MEPS  and  Mobile Examination  Testing  (MET)  sites  IAW  Reference  JTR,  Chapter  7,  Part  X,  Section  7660, Uniformed Services Applicants and Rejected Applicants. 4.2.1.1.

Vicinity  Travel.    Vicinity  travel  expenses  incurred  by  recruiting  personnel,  while performing  official  duties  in  and  around  the  duty  station,  are  reimbursable  IAW  JTR, Chapter 2, Part L, Local Travel, and section 2805, PDS Travel Area (Uniformed Members Only) and AFI 65-114, Chapter 6 and Chapter 11.

A COI is a planned event where meals or snacks are served to provide a setting for Air Force personnel to make a recruiting presentation.  16 AFI36-1901  20 JUNE 2017 4.4.2.  COI events are recruiting opportunities.  Whether meeting with prospective applicants or  with  community  influencers,  the  recruiter  is  trying  to  accomplish  a  specific  sales  goal.  The goal may be to generate an application or accession or to “sell” the idea of public service support to a media outlet.  In every case, the sales success of the COI can be measured. 4.4.2.1.  COIs  are  not  protocol  functions  and  recruiters  must  only  utilize  COIs  for authorized purposes and not to be used to reward past support. (T-2) 4.4.3.  The legislative authorities for sponsoring COI events are 10 USC §503, 520c and 37 USC  §  488.    Due  to  the  expenditure  of  appropriated  funds  involved  in  the  COI  program, public perception is an extremely sensitive issue.  Recruiters must ensure that COI funds and documentation  is  managed  properly.  (T-0)    COI  funds  are  exclusively  for  food,  beverages (excluding alcoholic beverages), and gratuity expenses.  Complimentary alcoholic beverages will not be, and will not appear to be accepted by recruiting personnel.

Reason  for  the  Program.  IAW  10  USC  §  503,  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  is responsible  for  conducting  intensive  recruiting  campaigns.    Each  Air  Component  creates, produces,  and  distributes  advertising  materials  to  support  all  personnel  procurement  programs.  The materials are to inform the public in general--and, in particular, persons who are eligible for military  service--about  specific  component  personnel  needs,  professional  development,  and career  opportunities  ultimately  focused  on  enabling  components  to  meet  their  congressionally programmed end-strength. 5.2.  Responsibilities.  Advertising and Marketing efforts are utilized to distribute the recruiting message  to  the  American  public  in  order  to  garner  qualified  prospects.    Due  to  the  unique mission  requirements,  each  component  will  be  responsible  for  their  individual  marketing  and advertising programs. (T-2) 5.2.1.

Marketing and Advertising Programs.  The importance of sustained, year-round national marketing and  advertising media programs  cannot  be overstated.  Marketing  efforts underwrite every  aspect  of  our  success.    At  the  tactical  level,  marketing  sponsors  the  most  powerful  lead-generating events; at the operational level, marketing provides web, data and lead management services; and at the strategic level; marketing inspires potential applicants across the nation and serves  as  a  hedge  against  long-term  risk  from  changing  economic  conditions  which  could provide  other  opportunities  for  the  most  competitive  young  Americans.    Programs  utilize effective  marketing  efforts  in  order  to  reach  the  most  diverse,  multi-cultural  prospects  at  the local, regional and national level.  Individual programs are as follows: 5.3.1.  RegAF. 5.3.2.  ANG. 5.3.3.  AFR. 18 AFI36-1901  20 JUNE 2017 5.3.4.  USAFA. 5.3.5.  AFROTC. 5.4.  Management  of  the  Programs.
