SUMMARY OF REVISIONSThis instruction updates, clarifies, and streamlines previous guidelines for CRADAs. It broadens applica-bility to all laboratories and/or technical activities, includes updates from changes in the public law, anduses the Air Force Technology Transfer Handbook as the source of operational guidelines. It also incorpo-rates AFI 61-303, Licensing Inventions Made Under Cooperative Research And Development Agree-ments. 1. CRADA Signature Process:  1.1. Signature Authority of CRADAs. Commanders and directors of Air Force laboratories and/ortechnical activities may negotiate and enter into CRADAs on behalf of the Air Force with variousorganizations in the public and private sector subject to the review process outlined in section 2. (Ref:AFI 61-301, 2.1) 2AFI61-302   30 May 20011.2. Collaborating Parties. The parties with which the Air Force may enter into CRADAs are: 1.2.1. Other Federal agencies in conjunction with other non-federal parties 1.2.2. Units of state or local government 1.2.3. Industrial organizations (for example, consortia, corporations, partnerships, limited part-nerships, industrial development organizations) 1.2.4. Public and private foundations 1.2.5. Nonprofit organizations (including universities) 1.2.6. Other persons (including licensees of inventions owned by the Air Force) 1.3. Signature Discretion. In considering whether to enter into a CRADA, the Signature Authorityshall take into account the present or planned work of the laboratory and/or technical activity. 1.4. Criteria for Selecting CRADA Partners. In considering whether to enter into a CRADA, theSignature Authority gives: 1.4.1. Special consideration to small business firms and consortia involving small business firms. 1.4.2. Preference to business units located in the United States which agree that those productsembodying inventions made under CRADAs will be substantially manufactured in the UnitedStates. 1.4.3. In the case of parties subject to the control of a foreign company or government, consider-ation to whether such a foreign government permits US agencies, organizations, or other personsto enter into CRADAs and licensing agreements. 1.4.4. Consideration to export control regulations, policies governing militarily critical technol-ogy, or any other restrictions on international technology transfer control set forth in Departmentof Defense (DoD) and Air Force directives and instructions. 1.5. Legal Counsel. Before entering into a CRADA, license agreement under a CRADA, or assign-ment of patent rights under a CRADA, commanders or directors must get legal counsel review of eachsuch agreement for its legal sufficiency. The Major Command legal office or servicing legal officeusing local command procedures shall give such review. 2. CRADA Review Process:  2.1. Review Authority for CRADAs. The Air Force Technology Executive Officer (TEO), Com-mander, Air Force Research Laboratory, has been delegated the CRADA reviewing authority for allAir Force activities. The TEO has the authority to redelegate this authority in accordance with AFI61-301, paragraph 1.2. 2.2. The reviewing official has authority to approve, disapprove, or require modification of anyCRADA within 30 days, beginning on the date the reviewing official receives the CRADA in his orher office. 2.3. When the reviewing official disapproves or requires modification of an agreement, he or shesends a written explanation to the Signature Authority within the 30-day period of paragraph 2.2. 2.4. CRADAs not reviewed, modified, or disapproved within 30 days of their receipt in the reviewingofficial’s office become effective. AFI61-302   30 May 200132.5. CRADAs shall be negotiated consistent with the Air Force model CRADA and guidelines foundin the Air Force Technology Transfer Handbook. In any case when the negotiation of a CRADAinvolves a substantive modification to a provision in the model CRADA (i.e., a change to CRADAlanguage required by the guidelines to be used verbatim), SAF/GCQ shall be consulted. 3. Delegation of CRADA Authority:  3.1. The TEO may redelegate the reviewing official authority to commanders and directors of labora-tories and/or technical activities for CRADAs executed by their activities or their subordinate activi-ties. This reviewing official authority may not be further delegated. 3.2. The holder of such delegated CRADA review authority shall designate the CRADA SignatureAuthority to his or her next lower management level. In no case shall the same person act as signatureand review authority on a CRADA. 4. Functions and Endeavors Allowed Under a CRADA:  4.1. Resources. CRADAs should be constructed to ensure Air Force receipt of adequate consider-ation for the technology being transferred to the outside partner. Air Force organizations may accept,retain, and use resources from, and provide resources to, CRADA partners. These resources may be inthe following categories: From the Air Force: - Personnel - Personal Property (Equipment, including maintenance support for the equipment or personal    property) - Facilities - Services - Intellectual Property From the CRADA Partner: - Personnel - Personal Property (Equipment) - Facilities - Services - Intellectual Property - Funds 4.1.1. Authority to accept, retain, and use funds derived from CRADAs. The expressed authorityin 15 U.S.C. § 3710a(b)(1) to “accept, retain, and use” funds from a collaborating party under aCRADA, in combination with the spending authority granted in 15 U.S.C. § 3714, provides anexception to the general prohibition on augmenting appropriations by permitting Air Force activi-ties to retain funds received under a CRADA without violating the Miscellaneous Receipts Stat-ute, 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b). 4AFI61-302   30 May 20014.1.2. Receipt of CRADA income. CRADA income, other than royalty or other income fromlicensing or assignment of inventions, is to be deposited under the servicing Defense AccountingOffice/Financial Services Office (DAO/FSO) ADSN, into suspense account 57F3875.CDA*. Thereceiving DAO/FSOs will establish local suspense accounts 57F3875.ROY* and 57F3875.CDA*in their databases as fund type “K” records. Replace the asterisk in the fourth position of the limitswith the fiscal year in which the money was received by the Air Force. 4.1.3. Uses of CRADA income. The funds derived from CRADAs, other than royalty or otherincome from licensing or assignment of inventions, may be used or obligated by appropriate doc-umentation showing the withdrawal of the amount and commitment or obligation to the desig-nated appropriation for the activity’s usage. This may be research, development, testing, andevaluation (RDT&E), operation and maintenance (O&M), one of the procurement accounts, orAir Force Working Capital Fund. CRADA revenue is available for obligation only until the end ofthe fiscal year in which the appropriation to which it is deposited expires for new obligations. 4.1.4. Hiring personnel for CRADAs. Air Force activities may use the funds received from aCRADA partner to hire personnel to carry out the CRADA. Such personnel shall not be subject tofull-time equivalent restrictions of the Air Force. 4.1.5. Government property may be provided to a CRADA partner on an exclusive, but tempo-rary basis, in accordance with 15 U.S.C. § 3710a(b)(1). Air Force activities must comply with alldemilitarization regulations prior to providing property to a CRADA partner on an exclusivebasis. Government property provided under a CRADA is not subject to a separate lease agree-ment. Model terms and conditions for providing such property are found in the Model CRADA.These terms generally will not apply to consumable property. 4.2. Determination of Intellectual Property Rights. For the purposes of negotiating pre-existingrights and/or administrative purposes, Air Force activities may need to determine rights in intellectualproperty. Any such determinations should be made with the advice of appropriate legal counsel. Anyinvention made under a CRADA, whether made solely by the CRADA partner or solely by an AirForce employee, or jointly, shall be disclosed to the servicing patent counsel or, if none is known, toAFMC LO/JAZ. 4.3. License Grants. The CRADA may contain a grant or an agreement in advance to grant to aCRADA partner patent licenses or assignments, or options thereto, for any invention made in wholeor in part by a Federal employee under the CRADA for reasonable compensation when appropriate.The CRADA may also grant a license, subject to section 209 of title 35, United States Code, to aninvention which is federally owned, for which a patent application was filed before the signing of theagreement, and directly within the scope of the work under the CRADA. 4.3.1. When licenses for inventions made under a CRADA are granted or contemplated, theCRADA shall provide that the CRADA partner has the option to choose an exclusive license for apre-negotiated field of use for any invention made under the CRADA. If there is more than oneCRADA partner, then the CRADA partners shall be offered the option to hold licensing rights thatcollectively encompass the rights that would be held under such an exclusive license by one party. 4.3.2. In consideration for the Air Force’s contribution under the CRADA, the Air Force, onbehalf of the U.S. Government, shall retain a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-uplicense to practice an invention, made by a Federal employee under the CRADA, or to have theinvention practiced throughout the world by or on behalf of the Government, and other rights thatAFI61-302   30 May 20015the commander or director may deem appropriate or otherwise are required by law. In the exerciseof such a license, the Air Force shall not publicly disclose trade secrets or commercial or financialinformation that is privileged or confidential within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4), or whichwould be considered as such if it had been obtained from a non-federal party. 4.3.3. The CRADAs shall ensure that the CRADA partner may retain title to any invention madesolely by its employee(s) in exchange for normally granting the Government a nonexclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice the invention or have the invention practicedthroughout the world by, or for, the Government for research or other Government purposes 4.4. Responsibility for Licensing.  4.4.1. Commanders or directors of Air Force laboratories and/or technical activities will execute,on behalf of the Air Force, patent licenses or assignments for Government-owned inventions madeunder CRADAs that are in the custody of the Air Force. The commanders or directors may redel-egate this authority to their subordinate activities. NOTE: Licenses concerning inventions madeunder CRADAs only are governed by this Instruction. Licenses concerning all other inventions inthe custody of the Air Force are governed by AFI 51-303. 4.4.2. Patent counsel for the servicing legal office shall provide assistance to commanders ordirectors of Air Force activities in preparing, negotiating and reviewing such licenses or assign-ments of inventions made under CRADAs. For Air Force activities that do not have a designatedservicing legal office patent counsel, AFMC LO/JAZ will provide the necessary assistance. 4.4.3. The Deputy General Counsel (Acquisition), SAF/GCQ, has general responsibility for thelegal aspects of the Air Force’s patent licensing/assignment program. A copy of all licenses orassignments of inventions made under a CRADA negotiated by an Air Force activity, and any sub-licenses, shall be provided to SAF/GCQ. Patent license agreements and assignments that deviatesubstantially from the Model Patent License or Assignment Agreement, as provided in the AirForce Technology Transfer Handbook, must also be reviewed and approved by SAF/GCQ. 4.4.4. SAF/GCQ will administer all patent licenses and assignments including receiving royaltiesor other payments, and disbursing such royalties or other payments. SAF/GCQ will maintainrecords of all such licenses and assignments. 4.5. Restrictions and Conditions for Patent Licenses and Assignments.  4.5.1. Patent licenses and assignments for Government-owned inventions made under CRADAswill be negotiated by the Technology Transfer Focal Point for the activity where the invention wasmade with the assistance of the servicing legal office patent counsel. Patent licenses and assign-ments shall be negotiated consistent with the Air Force model patent licenses and assignmentguidelines as provided in the Air Force Technology Transfer Handbook. 4.5.2. Licenses normally will contain a royalty provision or provide for some other form of con-sideration flowing to the Government. Terms and conditions shall be appropriate for the protectionof the interests of the Federal Government and the public and not in conflict with law or regula-tion. 4.6. Modification and Termination of a Patent License. Before terminating or modifying anypatent license or assignment (other than by mutual agreement) for Government-owned inventionsmade under a CRADA, the commander or director of the Air Force laboratory and/or technical activ-ity or delegee shall furnish the licensee and any sublicensee of record a written notice of intention to6AFI61-302   30 May 2001modify or terminate the license. Further, the commander or director or delegee shall allow the licenseeand any sublicensee, after such notice, to remedy any breach of the license or show cause why thelicense should not be modified or terminated. Any such modification or termination shall be coordi-nated with local patent servicing office and SAF/GCQ. 4.7. Other Intellectual Property License Agreements. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §3710a(a)(2), AirForce activities may negotiate license agreements for Government-owned inventions made or intel-lectual property developed at the Air Force activity. These agreements must comply with 35 U.S.C. §207, Patentability, Grant of Patents, and AFI 51-303, Intellectual Property -- Patents, Patent RelatedMatters, Trademarks, and Copyrights. 4.8. Disclosure of License Plans and Reports. The Air Force may treat reports submitted by licens-ees, when they contain commercial or financial information, as privileged information, which is notsubject to disclosure (35 U.S.C. § 209, 15 U.S.C. § 3710a(c)(7), and 5 U.S.C. § 552). In the exerciseof any nonexclusive license right retained by the Air Force on behalf of the U.S. Government, the AirForce shall not publicly disclose trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privilegedor confidential within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4) or which would be considered as such if ithad been obtained from a non-federal party. 4.9. Commercial Rights Permission. Air Force activities may permit Federal employees or formerFederal employees of the organization to participate in efforts to commercialize inventions that theymade while in the employment or service of the United States. Such an arrangement must comply withAir Force requirements and standards of conduct. 5. Scientific and Technical Information Requirements for Air Force Sponsors: Offices of Researchand Technology Applications (ORTAs) shall support DoD scientific and technical information gatheringefforts by collecting and maintaining information in support of the Defense Technology Transfer Informa-tion System (DTTIS). Information will be reported to DTTIS through the Air Force Technology TransferManagement Team. DARLEEN A.

Under a CRADA, thegovernment laboratories and/or technical activities shall provide personnel, services, facilities,equipment, or other resources with or without reimbursement (but not funds to the nonfederal parties).CRADAs are instruments that may be used in all aspects of a product and/or system life cycle whereRDT&E activities occur. The nonfederal parties shall provide funds, personnel, services, facilities,equipment, or other resources toward the conduct of specified research and development efforts that areconsistent with the missions of the laboratory and/or technical activity. The CRADA partners shall sharein the intellectual property developed under the effort. This term does not include a procurement contractor cooperative agreement as used in 31 U.S.C. §§ 6303, 6304, and 6305. Invention—Any invention or discovery that is or may be patentable or otherwise protected under Title 35of the United States Code or any novel variety of plant which is or may be protectable under the PlantVariety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. § 7321 et seq.). Laboratory and/or Technical Activity—For this instruction, that phrase is, as broadly defined, in 15U.S.C. 3710a(d)(2)(A), and shall include the following: A facility or group of facilities owned, leased, or otherwise used by the Air Force, a substantialpurpose of which is the performance of research, development, or engineering by employees of the AirForce. Use of this broad definition is deliberate. That definition is not confined to those Air Force com-ponents that are formally titled “laboratories.” The intent of that definition is to encompass the wide rangeof organizations and arrangements that function as laboratories and/or technical activities in Air Forceresearch, development, and engineering programs. It shall include laboratories and/or technical activitiesand reference more diverse arrangements that shall provide a virtual laboratory capability. For example,an Air Force component may have a virtual lab involving a management function accomplished in an AirForce activity, plus a dispersed set of research activities to be accomplished by a variety of organizationsoutside of the sponsoring and/or managing activity. Those capabilities are included in test, logistics, andproduct centers; depots; arsenals; program offices; and all Air Force offices providing for RDT&E. Thisis consistent with 15 U.S.C. 3710a(d)(2)(A) which uses such encompassing terms as “facility.” This broaddefinition is in accordance with new DoD practices. While the definition cited in 15 U.S.C. 3710a(d)(2)(A) occurs in a section of the United StatesCode dealing with CRADAs, the use of that broad definition in DoD Directive 5535.3 and DoD Instruc-tion 5535.8 shall not be limited to matters involving CRADAs. The broad definition applies to all cita-tions of laboratories and/or technical activities in this instruction. Made—In relation to any invention means the conception or first actual reduction to practice of suchInvention.
