Spatial  orientation  is  the  correct  perception  of  one’s  location  and orientation  within  an  environment.    Aspects  of  accurate  perception  in  flight  include recognition  of  the  location  of  the  ground,  changing  terrain,  and  the  horizon,  as  well  as  correct orientation of  yourself and your aircraft relative to known natural and man-made objects in the immediate  environment.    Spatial  orientation  must  account  for  the  3-dimensions  of  forward-aft, up-down, and left-right, as well as the concept of time. 1.1.1.  In  contrast  to  spatial  orientation,  SD  is  an  incorrect  perception  of  one’s  linear  and angular position and motion  relative to  the plane of the earth’s surface.   Specifically in  the flight environment, SD is an erroneous percept of any of the parameters displayed by aircraft control  and  performance  flight  instruments.    Regardless  of  a  pilot’s  experience  or proficiency,  sensory  illusions  can  lead  to  differences  between  instrument  indications  and what the pilot “feels” the aircraft is doing.  Disoriented pilots frequently are not aware of their  orientation  error  and  upon  recognizing  a  conflict  exists,  often  believe  an instrument  to  be  in  error.    Many  crashes  occur  when  pilots  fail  to  recognize  that  SD  is happening  or  when  there  is  not  enough  time  to  recover  once  a  conflict  has  been  properly diagnosed.  In general, unrecognized SD tends to occur during task-intensive portions of the mission,  while  recognized  SD  occurs  during  attitude  changing  maneuvers.  As  researchers1 have  stated,  “Accidents  do  not  occur  because  people  gamble  and  lose,  they  occur  because people do not believe that the accident about to occur is at all possible.” 1.1.2.  Another description of SD by Benson is that SD occurs when “the pilot fails to sense correctly  the  position,  motion,  or  attitude  of  his  aircraft  or  of  himself  within  the  fixed coordinate system provided by the surface of the Earth and the gravitational vertical.” 2  Later in this publication, different types of SD misperceptions and illusions are described.  It is rare to experience a single isolated and easily categorized misperception.  Often confusing visual and vestibular cues combine to induce SD in a pilot.  For instance, many vestibular illusions would  not  occur  if  adequate  visual  cues  (terrain,  horizon)  were  present.    And  furthermore, when  a  confusing  vestibular  sensation  results  from  extreme  maneuvering  in  a  high-performance  aircraft,  it  is  a  mixture  of  linear  and  angular  accelerations  and  consequently  a misinterpretation of linear and angular false sensations. 1.2.  SD Mishap Statistics.  SD mishap statistics are presented in this document to provide trend information  and  show  the  influence  of  training  and  mitigation  strategies  over  many  years  of aircraft  operations;  these  data  originated  from  USAF  Safety  Center  presentations  and  other published  or  formally  presented  findings.    As  one  researcher  found,  mishap  statistics  can significantly  vary  depending  on  the  definitions  used  by  the  mishap  board  or  investigator  or  by the search terms used in data gathering from a centralized databank. 3  For more recent statistics on  SD  mishap  rates,  consult  the  centralized  safety  reporting  database  or  the  AF  Safety  Center website.                                                  1  (Gibb, 2007) 2  (Benson, 1988)  3  (Previc and Ercoline, 2004) AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   7  1.3.  SD Incidence.  SD is an important issue for concern due to the high percentage of fatalities in  accidents  attributed  to  SD.    According  to  NATO’s  SD  Working  Group,  “across  all  aircraft categories, the percentage of aircraft accidents with fatalities was 2.2 fold higher in SD accidents compared  with  non-SD  accidents.”4 From  FY1993  to  FY2010,  there  were  62  USAF  Class  A mishaps with SD as causal or contributory costing 86 fatalities and $2.0B.5  An examination of USAF  mishap  data,  shown  in  Table  1.1,  found  that  from  FY2003  to  FY2011,  SD  had  an estimated  causal  or  contributory  role  in  33  mishaps  (13%)  resulting  in  30  fatalities  (41%)  and costing $1.1B.  Consequently, not only is the problem still plaguing modern-day USAF aviation, it may be getting worse.  USAF Safety Center data clearly shows the overall Class A mishap rate (accidents per 100,000 flying hours) has gone down significantly over the past few decades, yet the  SD  mishap  rate  has  remained  constant  in  those  same  decades.    Figure  1.1  depicts  the FY2007 to FY2011 data with a decreasing overall mishap rate, yet steady, if not increasing SD contributions. Table 1.1.  USAF Cost of Spatial Disorientation.  1.3.1.  Historically,  the  rate  of  SD  has  remained  relatively  constant  according  to  one  study examining  accident  rates  between  1958-1971  to  1972-1992  (0.32  and  0.35,  respectively); however,  a  near  10%  increase  in  accidents  being  caused  by  SD  was  noted.6   In  2012,  SD mishap data from FY03 to FY11 showed a surprising reduction in Class A mishaps per 100K flying  hours,  but  mishaps  attributable  to  SD  increased  from  0.2  back  to  the  0.3  seen  in  the previous studies of 1950s data.7 1.3.2.  Lack  of  improvement  in  SD  mishap  trends  may  be  caused  by  aircrew  under-appreciation, under-estimation, poorly understood operational definition of SD, inaccuracy of SD  contributions  in  mishap  investigations,  and  failing  to  respect  certain  mission-phase vulnerabilities  to  SD.    Additionally,  engineering  limitations  within  the  design  phase negatively  affect  a  thorough  analysis  of  operator  workload  and  cognition.    USAF  aircrews are facing increasingly complex missions in more challenging environments.  The cognitive demands of advanced avionics systems, head/helmet mounted displays, night vision devices, and night/all-weather environments are putting aircrew in situations with high risk for SD.                                                  4  (TR-HFM-118, 2008) 5  (Hancock, 2011) 6  (Ercoline, DeVilbiss, Lyons, 1994) 7  (Musselman, 2012)   8  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 Figure 1.1.  Class A Aviation Flight and SD Mishaps (FY 07-11)8.  1.4.  Susceptibility.  Sensory illusions occur regardless of pilot experience or proficiency; no one  is  immune  to  SD.    All  pilots  are  susceptible  to  illusions  while  flying  at  night,  in  various weather  conditions,  during  extreme  maneuvers,  and  even  in  visual  meteorological  conditions (VMC).  In other words, SD may happen at just about any time.  The previous study examining SD mishaps from FY2003 to FY2011 also examined total flying hours of the pilots involved in Class  A  SD  mishaps.9   The  study  found  that  total  hours  of  the  pilots  involved  in  Class  A  SD mishaps ranged from 500 to 4,000 flying hours, with an average of 2,000 total hours.  The study also  found  that  a  pilot  with  fewer  than  1,000  flying  hours  in  a  particular  aircraft  increased  the odds of an SD mishap, regardless of total flying hours.  Other factors which increase the risk of aircrew  developing  SD  include:  night  flight  (2.1  fold),  instrument  meteorological  conditions (IMC, 2.7 fold), poor backdrop (3.2 fold), and adverse Crew or Cockpit Resource Management, (CRM,  3.8  fold). 10    In  USAF  flight  operations,  the  primary  factor  cited  as  leading  to disorientation  is  inattention  (50%);  in  the  majority  (85%)  of  these  cases,  the  aircrew’s disorientation remained unrecognized.11 1.5.  Coping  with  SD.  In  order  to  assist  aircrew  who  face  a  higher  risk  of  disorientation, NATO’s  SD  working  group  recommends  training  in  multi-task,  high  workload  simulations  to demonstrate  SD  susceptibility,  using  scenarios  such  as  low-level  abort  into  weather, maneuvering  over  water  in  haze,  tanker  rejoin  at  night,  or  cockpit  distraction  while  on  NVGs.                                                    8  (Musselman, 2012) 9  (Musselman, 2012) 10  (TR-HFM-118, 2008) 11  (TR-HFM-118, 2008) 00.20.40.60.811.21.41.60708091011Class A Rate/100kClass A SD rate/100kLinear (Class A Rate/100k)Linear (Class A SD rate/100k)AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   9  Improving  the  aircrew’s  understanding  of  the  sensory  systems,  physiological  mechanisms  of various  illusions,  and  conditions  of  flight  where  these  illusions  may  be  expected  can  help  to successfully prevent or cope with SD.  Training is important to counter susceptibility to SD since often SD occurs with other contributing factors such as fatigue, impoverished visual conditions, and  cognitively  demanding  tasks  (intense  mission  phases  of  flying).    Because  of  these contributing factors, NATO recommends training on high-risk scenarios during advanced flying training,  operational  flying  training  units,  upgrade  to  flight  lead  or  instructor,  conversion  to  a new  aircraft,  standardization/evaluation  check  rides,  and  annually.12   High  fidelity  trainers  and simulators  can  be  used  to  practice  instrument  crosscheck  and  effective  CRM  in  realistic situations typically resulting in SD.  One study of pilots trained in SD simulator training showed the  aircrew  in  the  “SD  Trained  Group  coped  significantly  better  in  terms  of  maintaining situational  awareness  and  crew  resource  management  than  the  control  group”  and  were  rated more prepared for the unexpected, resulting in fewer near controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) or crashes  than  an  untrained  control  group. 13    Hence,  through  training  a  pilot  could  learn  to recognize environmental cues and risk-assess situations in which SD is more likely to occur.                                                  12  (TR-HFM-118, 2008) 13  (TR-HFM-118, 2008)   10  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 Chapter 2 MECHANISMS OF VISION & ORIENTATION SYSTEMS 2.1.  A  person’s  perception  of  spatial  orientation  develops  from  the  interpretation  of sensory  input  by  the  conscious  and  subconscious  aspects  of  the  brain.  The  subconscious mind  uses  sensory  information  from  the  ambient  (or  peripheral)  visual  system,  the  vestibular system  and  the  somatosensory  system  to  maintain  orientation  and  equilibrium,  as  well  as auditory  inputs.    This  information  is  processed  automatically  at  very  high  rates  and  without conscious effort.  When walking on the ground, with a known horizon and constant G-force, our visual,  vestibular,  and  somatosensory  processes  work  exceptionally  well  in  maintaining  our spatial  orientation.    The  conscious  mind  employs  central  (focal)  vision  to  determine  spatial orientation  by  comparing  sensory  inputs  to  known  experiences.    In  contrast  to  the  speedy processes  of  the  subconscious,  information  processed  in  the  conscious  mind  is  relatively  slow, requiring  active  thought,  but  is  normally  very  accurate.    For  earthbound  activities,  our subconscious orientation system receives adequate information from the sensory systems.  Four systems are used for spatial orientation: visual, vestibular, somatosensory, and auditory (Figure 2.1). Figure 2.1.  Four Orientation Systems. 2.2.  However, when a person is subjected to the flight environment, these sensory systems are  no  longer  adapted  to  the  environment  and  the  conscious  and  subconscious  mind  may misinterpret information from the sensory systems regarding orientation in space.  When a  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   11  pilot  can  easily  see  his/her  flying  environment  by  looking  out  the  window/glare-shield,  the process  of  spatial  orientation  is  direct  and  seemingly  effortless,  because  much  of  it  is accomplished by unconscious processes.  Any confusing vestibular inputs are ignored because of visual  dominance.    Within  the  flying  domain,  vision  accounts  for  nearly  80%  of  a  pilot’s orientation.  In contrast, when flying in IMC or without reliable external attitude or motion cues, only the conscious mind can correctly determine true orientation, through the use of focal vision and attention to flight instruments.  With an 80 % loss of orientation due to impoverished visual conditions, it is very difficult to ignore the 20% of confusing vestibular input.  Even though it is possible to  indirectly  establish spatial  orientation through aircraft instrumentation  and displays, orientation comes at a high cognitive demand.  This high cognitive and attention demand of the pilot competes with other mission-specific demands such as in-flight mission planning, decision making, and risk assessment of different courses of actions. 2.3.  Visual  System.  Vision  is  by  far  the  most  important  sensory  system  for  providing  true spatial  orientation  during  flight.    In  the  absence  of  vision,  orientation  would  be  derived  solely from  the  less  accurate  vestibular  or  somatosensory  systems,  and  these  systems  do  not  provide reliable motion and position cues in the flight environment. 2.3.1.  Visual  Dominance.    To  minimize  the  effects  of  SD,  aircrew  must  understand  visual perception,  by  experiencing  the  concepts  of  visual  dominance  and  vestibular  suppression.  We  rely  heavily  on  the  visual  system  to  successfully  function  within  our  normal  everyday environment.  This visual system must dominate the other sensory inputs.  Consequently, we must  learn  to  suppress  the  vestibular  input  experienced  in  the  unique  flight  environment.  Vestibular suppression is the ability to suppress unwanted vestibular sensations and reflexes.  A pilot’s ability to accomplish vestibular suppression comes from practice or exposure to the motion of the flight environment.  An experienced pilot is more likely to suppress vestibular signals than an inexperienced pilot. 2.3.2.  Ambient and  Focal  Vision.  The visual system is  actually composed of two separate visual systems providing different visual functions. 2.3.2.1.  The  ambient  (mainly  peripheral)  visual  system  is  primarily  concerned  with  the question  of  “where,”  thus  providing  us  an  important  piece  of  the  spatial  orientation mental  “picture.”    Because  ambient  vision  is  monitored  at  the  subconscious  level,  the information  is  processed  automatically  at  very  high  rates  and  without  conscious  effort.  The  ambient  visual  system  is  most  sensitive  to  motion  and  works  well  in  low  light conditions.    It  has  very  poor  acuity,  meaning  object  recognition  does  not  usually  occur without bringing the object into focal vision (see below).  The ambient visual system is what  allows  you  to  perceive  a  change  in  attitude  relative  to  the  horizon  without consciously  being  aware  that  you  noticed  a  change  in  attitude.    The  ambient  visual system is what allows pilots to orient themselves within their environment. 2.3.2.2.  The focal (or central) visual system is primarily concerned with the question of “what,”  providing  fine  detail  for  recognition.    For  spatial  orientation,  focal  vision provides  visual  cues  for  judgment  about  distance  and  depth,  color,  and  relative  size.  Focal  vision  orients  objects  in  an  environment  relative  to  the  pilot.    The  focal  vision system is what allows you to accurately read your flight instruments and displays.  While focal  vision  operates  with  great  precision  and  accuracy  allowing  you  to  discriminate detail  (20/20  vision),  it  is  processed  in  the  conscious  mind  relatively  slowly,  requiring   12  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 active  thought.    Also,  focal  vision  is  extremely  slow  to  adapt  to  low-light  conditions, requiring  20-30  minutes  of  adaptation,  and  even  then  your  visual  acuity  is  dangerously poor (20/200 to 20/400). 14  This slow adaptation is further hindered by the fovea, an area of cones located in the central visual field.  Because this area has no rods, it becomes a night blind spot. 2.3.3.  Visual  Conditions  in  Flight.    During  flight,  the  utility  of  external  visual  references varies with the quality of available visual information.  Because of the dynamic relationship between visual information available and mission requirements, all aviators should be aware that SD is possible under a wide variety of visual and varying workload conditions. 2.3.3.1.  Adequate External  Vision.  SD can occur on a clear day  as a result of extreme linear  and/or  angular  accelerations,  unusual  aircraft  attitudes,  or  lack  of  attention  to  the environment.   Under such circumstances,  reference to  a distinct horizon in combination with flight instruments should allow the pilot to maintain visual dominance and naturally suppress  false  vestibular  and  somatosensory  orientation  cues.    There  are  however particular  visual  environments,  addressed  later  in  this  chapter,  that  can  cause  a  pilot  to misperceive the terrain, sky, horizon, and approach and landing environments even when adequate visual cues appear to be seen. 2.3.3.2.  Degraded  Visual  and  Instrument  Conditions.    At  night,  in  IMC,  or  in  marginal VMC  (i.e.,  when  adequate  external  visual  references  are  not  available),  the  pilot  must maintain spatial orientation and a state of visual dominance solely by reference to aircraft instruments,  especially  the  attitude  display.    This  is  the  indirect  perception  of  spatial orientation.  The key to success in instrument flying is to develop an effective instrument crosscheck, which provides a continuous source of accurate information related to aircraft attitude, motion, and position.  A proficient pilot with an effective crosscheck will have less  difficulty  in  maintaining  visual  dominance  and  ignoring  other,  potentially disorienting,  sensory  data.    The  pilot  should  be  aware  that  what  is  seen  outside  the aircraft may be confusing and may lead to visual illusions and sensory conflicts.  During times when the aircraft instruments are the sole source of accurate information, pilots can count on becoming disoriented unless they direct their attention to see, correctly interpret, process, and believe the information provided by the instruments – and ultimately “make the  instruments  read  right”  regardless  of  the  sensations  felt.    However,  in  certain situations this can be extremely difficult and cognitively demanding on the pilot. 2.4.  Vestibular  System.  The  vestibular  system  contains  the  primary  organs  of  equilibrium  of balance  and  thus  plays  a  major  role  in  the  sensation  of  motion  and  spatial  orientation.    It  aids vision by providing angular and linear acceleration information to stabilize the eyes when motion of  the  head  and  body  would  otherwise  result  in  blurred  vision.    On  the  ground,  the  vestibular system provides reasonably accurate perception of position and motion.  In flight, the ability to sustain motion in the aircraft results in a mismatch between the vestibular input of the inner ear and  the  actual  aircraft  motion.    When  walking  around  in  everyday  life,  our  senses  provide continuous  input  regarding  which  way  is  up  and  which  way  is  down.    Perceptual  adaptation  is the body’s capability to come to a state of equilibrium in preparation for the next sensory change.  This  perceptual  characteristic  however  greatly  complicates  spatial  orientation  in  the  extreme sensory  environment  of  flight  because  in  aviation  the  pilot  may  still  be  maneuvering  but  the                                                  14  (AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2011-0003, 2011) AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   13  vestibular  system  may  have  returned  to  a  state  of  equilibrium.    Consequently,  when  the maneuvering  is  ceased,  the  vestibular  system  detects  change  and  a  false  sensory  input  of vestibular  acceleration  is  perceived,  confusing  the  pilot  if  visual  cues  are  not  available.    To understand how this vestibular information  can be erroneous, one must look  at  its two sensors: the semicircular canals and the otolith organs of the inner ear. 2.4.1.  Semicircular  Canals.    The  three  semicircular  canals  on  each  side  of  the  head approximate  right  angles  to  each  other  so  that  angular  accelerations  in  any  spatial  plane (pitch, roll, or  yaw)  can  be detected (Figure  2.2).  The fluid within  the semicircular  canals moves  relative  to  the  canal  walls  when  angular  accelerations  are  applied  to  the  head.    This fluid  movement  bends  sensory  hair  filaments  in  specialized  portions  of  the  canals,  which sends nerve impulses to the brain resulting in the perception of rotary motion in the plane of the  canal  stimulated.    Again,  since  the  response  characteristics  of  the  semicircular  canal system  evolved  for  our  ground-based  environment  of  sudden  stop-and-go  movements, peculiar errors may be induced during sustained motion in flight.  For example, a very small or  short-lived  angular  acceleration  may  not  be  perceived  accurately,  and  the  resulting sustained angular velocity may not be perceived at all, either one resulting in a large change in actual attitude awareness over a short period of time.  Additionally, angular accelerations experienced in flight can be quite different from those experienced on the ground.  Hence, we often erroneously interpret the sensations produced by the fluid movement in the semicircular canal. Figure 2.2.  Semicircular Canals.  2.4.2.  Otolith  Organs.    In  the  presence  of  linear  acceleration  or  gravity,  the  relative movements of the otolithic membranes (Figure 2.3) bend the sensory hairs that penetrate the otolithic membranes over the underlying structures (the result of a shearing force).  Without any  linear  acceleration,  shearing  force  due  to  gravity  is  transformed  into  nerve  impulses  to the brain, which convey information about head position relative to true vertical.  With linear acceleration, a resultant shearing force is generated and the signals to the brain are the same as  those  produced  by  a  shift  in  the  direction  of  gravity.    During  flight,  inertial  forces  are combined  with  the  force  of  gravity  and  act  upon  the  otolithic  membranes  to  produce  a  net combined  force.    The  direction  of  this  combined  or  resultant  force  is  almost  never  in  the   14  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 direction  of  the  true  vertical.  Hence,  it  is  almost  impossible  to  correctly  determine  the  true direction of “down” from the otolith organs. Figure 2.3.  Otolith Organs.  2.5.  Somatosensory  System.  Buried  in  many  body  structures,  including  the  skin,  joints,  and muscles, the somatosensory receptors provide important equilibrium information as they respond to pressure and stretch, also called the proprioceptive system.  The sensations they elicit are the deep  pressure  feelings  that  you  experience  when  you  sit  or  the  sensations  that  enable  you  to know the relative positions of  your  arms, legs, and body.  This  system is commonly called the “seat-of-the-pants”  sense  because  some  early  pilots  believed  they  could  determine  which  way was  down  by  analyzing  which  portions  of  their  bodies  were  subject  to  the  greatest  amount  of pressure.    The  “seat-of-the-pants”  sense  is  completely  unreliable  as  an  attitude  indicator  when moving in the aerial environment. 2.6.  Auditory  System.  The auditory response in  flight  is  unique in that it  is  an acquired skill.  Pilots  learn  early  in  Undergraduate  Pilot  Training  (UPT)  that  when  the  aircraft  is  going  fast, there  is  more  airframe/canopy  wind  noise,  and  when  the  aircraft  is  going  slow,  the  noise  level decreases.    Thus,  the  pilot  is  able  to  grossly  discern  airspeed  by  the  noise  level  in  the  cockpit.  For  some  pilots,  the  first  clue  that  they  are  disoriented  is  a  mismatch  between  the  sounds  they expect  to  hear,  based  upon  their  perceived  attitude,  and  the  actual  “wind”  noise  present.  Although this is not a very precise method, it is often a first clue that something may be out of sync.    A  quick  look  at  the  flight  instruments  is  needed  to  correctly  confirm  a  possible misperception.  However, some aircraft fail to provide this sensory feedback mechanism, in that AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   15  the aerodynamic control feel and auditory feedback may not provide sufficient cues for aircraft speed and attitude. 2.7.  Types  of  Spatial  Disorientation.  There  are  three  distinct  types  of  spatial  disorientation.  Type  I  is  unrecognized  spatial  disorientation;  the  pilot  is  unaware  that  anything  is  wrong  and controls  the  aircraft  in  response  to  the  false  sensations  of  attitude  and  motion.    Type  II  is recognized disorientation; the pilot is aware that something is wrong, but may not realize that the source  of  the  problem  is  spatial  disorientation.    The  pilot  usually  suspects  an  instrument malfunction, and in a few cases it has been reported that the pilot will “tap” on the display glass to  see  if  it  is  stuck,  even  with  Cathode  Ray  Tubes  (CRTs).    Type  III  is  incapacitating  spatial disorientation; the pilot knows something is wrong, but the physiological or emotional responses to the disorientation are so great that the pilot is unable to recover the aircraft.  This may result from  the  pilot’s  inability  to  obtain  visual  information  due  to  blurring  of  vision  (nystagmus).  However,  there  have  been  several  reports  of  this  occurring  during  air  refueling  or  flying fingertip. An example of each type of disorientation follows: 2.7.1.  Example  of  Type  I  SD.    The  last  of  four  aircraft  took  off  on  a  daytime  sortie  in  the weather,  intending  to  follow  the  other  three  in  a  radar  in-trail  departure.    Because  of  a navigational error shortly  after takeoff, the pilot  was unable to  acquire the other aircraft on radar.  Frustrated, the pilot elected to intercept the other aircraft knowing they would be on the  arc  of  the  Standard  Instrument  Departure.    The  pilot  proceeded  directly  to  that  point, scanning the radar diligently for the blips that should be appearing at any time.  Meanwhile, after  climbing  to  4,000  feet  above  ground  level,  the  pilot  entered  a  2,000-  3,000  foot  per minute descent as the result of an unrecognized, 3-degree nose-low attitude.  After receiving requested position information from another member of the flight, the mishap pilot suddenly made a steeply banked turn, either to avoid a perceived threat of collision or to join up with the  rest  of  the  flight.    Unfortunately,  the  pilot  had  already  descended  far  below  the  other aircraft and was going too fast to avoid the ground.  This mishap resulted from unrecognized, or  Type  I,  disorientation.    The  specific  illusion  responsible  was  the  somatogravic  illusion created  by  the  forward  acceleration  of  the  aircraft  during  takeoff  and  climb-out.  Preoccupation with the radar scanning compromised the pilot’s instrument crosscheck to the point  where  the  false  vestibular  cues  were  able  to  dominate  orientation  information processing.  Having accepted this inaccurate spatial orientation “feeling,” the pilot controlled the aircraft accordingly until it was too late to recover.  Also, the lack of reliable visual cues outside  of  the  aircraft  had  the  pilot  juggling  multiple  tasks  and  spending  time  allocating attention to indirect spatial orientation via the aircraft instruments and displays. 2.7.2.  Example  of  Type  II  SD.    On  a  clear  day  with  unlimited  visibility  and  a  distinct horizon, the pilot was flying a two-on-two  air combat training mission over water.  After a series of roll reversals during the engagement, the pilot thought the aircraft was straight and level  when  the  pilot  acquired  the  bandits  slightly  low  and  to  the  right.    In  reality,  the  pilot was  in  a  90-degree  left  bank  looking  up  at  the  other  aircraft.    To  ensure  a  successful separation, the pilot rolled to the left and pulled to raise the nose slightly.  Actually, the pilot had rolled almost inverted and pulled down.  What alerted the pilot to being disoriented was that  the  aircraft  sounded  as  if  it  was  going  very  fast  (this  is  the  beginning  of  Type  II—the pilot suspects something to be wrong, in this case it was an aural cue).  When the pilot looked inside  and  checked,  the  instruments  showed  the  pilot  was  in  an  inverted  60-70  degree  dive accelerating  through  Mach.    The  recovery  was  all  instinct--  roll  to  the  nearest  horizon  and   16  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 pull.  The pilot pulled 12.5 G during the recovery and bottomed out at 2,000 feet above the water.  This incident of recognized, or Type II SD, occurred because of channelized attention on the second bandit, a breakdown of crosscheck, and subsequent loss of attitude awareness.  Type II SD happens more often than mishap reporting would indicate and is a known hazard associated with employing an aircraft as a weapons platform. 2.7.3.  Because  incapacitating  or  Type  III  SD  results  from  overwhelming,  incapacitating physiological  response  to  physical  or  emotional  stimuli,  it  can  be  difficult  to  prove  during mishap  investigation  given  the  perishable  nature  of  investigative  evidence.    Unfortunately, any  mishap  occurring  that  had  the  pilot  failing  to  eject  and/or  losing  situational  awareness could be an example of a Type III SD.  One common reference describes an F-15E pilot who was engaged with two other F-15s on a clear day.  He initiated a hard left turn at 17,000 feet AGL and began an estimated 150 to 180 degree/sec left roll for an undetermined reason. The pilot communicated “out-of-control auto-roll” and executed at least one successful attempt to stop the roll, resulting in momentary cessation at 8,000 feet AGL. Unfortunately, the aircraft began to roll again.  Within 40 seconds of the roll start, the pilot attempted ejection and was fatally  injured.    Investigators  could  not  establish  if  the  roll  was  induced  by  a  mechanical malfunction  or  by  the  pilot  who  may  have  experienced  a  vestibulocular  illusion. 15  Investigators may have a limited understanding what the pilot sensed and perceived is which contributes  to  the  challenge  of  accident  investigation  and  determination  of  exact  causal factors. 2.8.  Causes  of  Spatial  Disorientation.  There  are  a  number  of  conditions  or  factors  that  will increase  the  potential  for  spatial  disorientation.    Some  of  these  situations  are  related  to  human factors  (i.e.  physiological  or  psychological)  while  others  are  external  factors  related  to  the environment  in  which  the pilot  must  operate.  Awareness  on the part of the pilot  is required to reduce  the  risks  associated  with  these  situations  and  factors.    Although  SD  episodes  are  found throughout  the  experience  range  of  pilots,  it  is  most  commonly  noticed  within  the  first  500  – 1,000 hours of learning to fly an aircraft new to the pilot, regardless of total experience.16 2.8.1.  Personal  Factors.    Mental  stress,  fatigue,  hypoxia,  various  medicines,  G-stress, temperature  stresses,  and  emotional  problems  can  reduce  the  pilot’s  ability  to  resist  spatial disorientation.    A  pilot  who  is  proficient  at  accomplishing  and  prioritizing  mission  tasks (with an efficient instrument crosscheck), is mentally alert, and is physically and emotionally qualified  to  fly  will  have  significantly  less  difficulty  maintaining  orientation.    On  the  other hand, a pilot who becomes easily task-saturated, fails to properly prioritize tasks, is mentally stressed,  is  preoccupied  with  personal  problems,  is  fatigued,  is  ill  or  taking  non-prescribed medication, is at increased risk of becoming disoriented. 2.8.2.  Workload.    A  pilot’s  performance  on  instruments  and  formation  flying  is  decreased when he or she is busy manipulating cockpit controls and either anxious, mentally stressed, or  fatigued.    When  the  pilot  is  distracted  from  crosschecking  the  instruments  during  task intensive  phases  of  flight  in  marginal  weather  or  reduced  visibility  conditions,  the  pilot’s ability to recognize and resist SD is severely diminished.                                                  15  (Fundamentals of Aerospace Medicine 4th ed, 2008)  16  (NATO, 2008) AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   17  2.8.3.  Fatigue.    Although  mentioned  above  with  personal  factors,  fatigue  is  such  a  major contributor to degraded cognitive functioning it needs to be singled-out as a cause of SD.  As presented  in  this  discussion  on  SD,  it  takes  conscious  processing  to  indirectly  ascertain spatial  orientation  when  visual  cues  are  removed.    A  symptom  of  fatigue  is  difficulty concentrating and focusing on cognitive tasks. 2.8.4.  Inexperience.    Inexperienced  pilots  with  little  instrument  time  are  particularly vulnerable to  spatial  disorientation.    It  takes time and experience to  “feel” comfortable in  a new aircraft system and develop a solid, effective instrument crosscheck.  A pilot who must still  search  for  switches,  knobs,  and  controls  in  the  cockpit  has  less  time  to  concentrate  on flight  instruments  and  may  be  distracted  during  a  critical  phase  of  instrument  flight.    The cockpit  workload  associated  with  complex  aircraft  is  particularly  significant  for  the  recent pilot graduate or pilots new to these systems.  A second crewmember is not always available to change radio channels, set up navigation aids, and share other cockpit chores.  Therefore, it  is  essential  for  an  effective  instrument  crosscheck  to  be  developed  early  and  established during  all  phases  of  flight.    Other  cockpit  duties,  like  radio  changes,  radar  operation,  etc., must not be allowed to distract the pilot from basic instrument flying.  Also, pilots who are less  experienced  in  a  particular  airframe  and  its  mission  may  find  themselves  in  novel situations  and  quickly  become  disoriented.    In  contrast,  pilots  who  are  familiar  with  an aircraft and mission can experience similar maneuvering and situations but can more easily maintain their orientation; due to training and experience, the situations are not as novel for experienced aviators. 2.8.5.  Proficiency.    Total  flying  time  does  not  protect  an  experienced  pilot  from  spatial disorientation.  Proficiency and total number of flying hours or sorties in the past 30 days is more important.   Aircraft  mishaps due to  SD generally involve a pilot  who has had limited flying experience in the past 30 days.  Flying proficiency begins to deteriorate rapidly after 3 or 4 weeks out of the cockpit.  Vulnerability to SD is high for the first few flights following a significant break in flying duties. 2.8.6.  Instrument  Time.    Pilots  with  less  instrument  time  are  more  susceptible  to  SD  than more experienced pilots.  Many SD incidents have been reported during the penetration turn, final  approach,  climb-out  after  takeoff,  trail  departures,  and  while  performing  high-performance flight maneuvers.  This is when the vestibular illusions are the most devastating.  Other  very  critical  times  are  at  night  and  during  weather  formation  flights,  when  the wingman loses sight of the lead, or when a pilot flying in VMC suddenly enters IMC. 2.8.7.  Phases of Flight.  Although distraction, channelized attention, and task saturation are not  the  same  as  spatial  disorientation,  they  precipitate  it  by  keeping  the  pilot  from maintaining  an  effective  instrument  crosscheck.    SD  incidents  have  occurred  during  all phases  of  flight.    During  the  following  critical  phases  pilots  are  particularly  susceptible  to becoming  spatially  disoriented  because  of  the  extra  potential  for  distraction,  channelized attention, and task saturation. 2.8.7.1.  Takeoff and Landing.  The takeoff and landing phases of flight occur in dynamic and  demanding  environments.    Aircraft  acceleration,  speed,  trim  requirements,  rate  of climb or descent, and rate of turn are all undergoing frequent changes.  The aircraft may pass between VMC and IMC.  At night, ground lights may add confusion.  Radio channel or  IFF/SIF  changes  may  be  directed  during  a  critical  phase  of  flight  while  close  to  the   18  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 interrupt  an  efficient instrument  crosscheck. ground. Unexpected changes in climb-out or approach clearance may increase workload and   An  unexpected  or  poorly planned/briefed  missed  approach  or  circling  approach  at  night  or  in  IMC  is  particularly demanding.    Also,  a  field  with  poor  lighting  can  quickly  become  a  highly  demanding approach  and  landing  at  night  or  in  IMC.    Finally,  the  configuration  changes  of  the aircraft  during  these  phases  of  flight,  along  with  degraded  visual  cues,  may  result  in misperception of acceleration and pitch.  Extending the gear and flaps during an approach may cause deceleration to be perceived as a nose-down attitude. 2.8.7.2.  Air-to-Ground  &  Air-to-Air.    Another  critical  phase  of  flight,  with  a  high potential  for  spatial  disorientation,  is  the  maneuvering  associated  with  air-to-ground ordnance  deliveries  during  impoverished  visual  conditions  and  air  combat  maneuvers.  Again, under such conditions the only completely reliable information related to aircraft attitude  is  provided  to  the  pilot  by  the  flight  instruments.    Because  of  the  nature  of  the mission,  the  pilot’s  attention  is  directed  outside  the  cockpit.    Potential  for  distraction  is great.  What the pilot sees outside the cockpit may be misleading or the pilot may fail to scan  an  important  instrument  parameter  (such  as  attitude,  airspeed,  altitude,  or  vertical velocity) during a critical phase of the weapons delivery.  These factors easily can lead to an  unrecognized  SD  or  “lack  of  attitude  awareness”  in  which  the  pilot  inadvertently places  the  aircraft  in  a  position  from  which  recovery  is  impossible.    Recently  mishaps have  occurred  during  high  angle  strafing  maneuvers  while  the  pilot  was  flying  in  low illumination night conditions wearing NVGs; other factors were mountainous terrain and fatigue.  Pre-mission planning and risk assessment is vital for safe and effective mission accomplishment.  Again, NVG use can reduce acuity, contrast, and ambient visual cues and orientation processing, thus strict adherence to procedures is required. 2.8.7.3.  Formation Flying.  Night or weather formation flights are demanding situations with a high potential for creating SD.  Formation flying presents special problems to the pilot  in  maintaining  spatial  orientation.    First  and  most  important,  pilots  flying  on  the wing  cannot  maintain  appropriate  visual  dominance.    They  are  deprived  of  any  reliable visual information concerning aircraft attitude related to the earth’s surface.  They cannot see the true horizon and have little or no time to scan their own instruments.  Under these conditions,  it  becomes  difficult  to  suppress  information  provided  by  unreliable  sources such as the vestibular system.  Illusions of various kinds are almost inevitable.  A pilot’s concentration  on  maintaining  proper  wing  position  may  be  compromised  by  what  the pilot “feels” the aircraft attitude  to be.  Lack of confidence in lead will increase tension and anxiety.  An inexperienced flight lead will most certainly aggravate the situation due to  abrupt  control  inputs.    Also,  poor  in-flight  communications  and  the  lack  of  specific properly  briefed  procedures  to  help  recover  a  disoriented  wingman  will  increase  the potential for an aircraft mishap.  Consequently, direct communication inputs from lead or other pilots to the SD pilot/aircrew can help recovery. AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   19  Chapter 3 ILLUSIONS AND MISPERCEPTIONS 3.1.  Vestibular  Illusions.  In the absence of adequate visual orientation cues, the inadequacies of the vestibular and somatosensory systems can, and generally do, result in orientation illusions.  It is customary to discuss vestibular illusions in relation to the two components that generate the illusions--the  semicircular  canals  and  the  otolith  organs.    However,  as  mentioned  previously,  a pilot  will  rarely  have  a  sensation  of  only  one  of  the  two  different  vestibular  systems.    A combination  of  sensory  inputs  is  often  perceived  by  the  pilot,  but  for  the  presentation  of  the information they are presented individually. 3.2.  Somatogyral Illusions.  This set of illusions result from the semicircular canals’ inability to register accurately a prolonged rotation, i.e., sustained angular velocity. 3.2.1.  Graveyard  Spin  (Figure  3.1).    This  situation  begins  with  the  pilot  intentionally  or unintentionally  entering  a  spin.    The  pilot’s  first  impression  is  accurate;  that  is,  a  spin  is perceived.    After  about  10  to  20  seconds  of  constant  rotation  (no  angular  acceleration),  the fluid in the canals comes to rest with respect to the canal walls and the sensory hairs return to the upright, resting position (equilibrium and perceptual adaptation).  The sensation is that of no rotational motion despite the fact that the spin continues.   If the spin  is then terminated, the  angular  deceleration  produced  causes  a  relative  motion  between  the  fluid  and  the  canal walls deflecting the sensory hairs in the opposite direction.  The pilot erroneously perceives spinning  in  the  opposite  direction.  If  the  pilot  does  not  recognize  the  illusion  and  acts  to correct this false impression, he or she will put the aircraft back into the original spin. 3.2.2.  Graveyard  Spiral  (Figure  3.1).    In  this  maneuver  the  pilot  has  intentionally  or unintentionally  put  the  aircraft  into  a  prolonged  turn  with  a  moderate  or  steep  bank.    The constant  rate of turn  causes the pilot  to  lose the  sensation of turning after a period of time.  Noting a loss of altitude, the pilot may pull back on the controls or perhaps add power in an attempt  to  regain  the  lost  altitude  without  checking  that  an  increase  in  bank  has  occurred.  Unless the incorrectly perceived bank attitude is corrected, such actions only serve to tighten a downward spiral.  Once the spiral has been established, the pilot sometimes experiences the illusion  of  turning  in  the  opposite  direction  after  the  turning  motion  of  the  aircraft  has stopped.  Under these circumstances, if the pilot fails to suppress all sensory data except the visual,  vestibular  illusions  may  cause  inappropriate  inputs,  resulting  in  re-establishment  of the spiral.   20  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 Figure 3.1.  Graveyard Spin/Spiral.  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   21  3.2.3.  Coriolis  Illusion  (Figure  3.2).    During  high  turn  rates,  abrupt  head  movements  may cause  pilots  to  perceive  motions  they  are  not  actually  doing.    When  the  body  is  in  a prolonged  turn  in  one  plane,  the  fluid  in  those  canals  stimulated  by  the  onset  of  the  turn eventually comes up to speed with the canal walls.  If the head is then tilted in another plane, the angular momentum of the fluid causes it to move again relative to the canal walls.  The resulting  sensation  is  one  of  rotation  in  a  third  plane.    This  has  also  been  called  a  “cross-coupling”  sensation  and  may  provide  a  feeling  of  tumbling.    If  pilots  try  to  correct  for  the illusion without referencing their flight instruments, they may put the aircraft in a dangerous attitude.    Research  has  attempted  to  further  understand  the  Coriolis  illusion  but  given  the multiple aircraft forces and maneuvers (G-forces and bank) combined with pilot initial head position  and  subsequent  head  movements  it  is  difficult  to  truly  isolate  and  quantify.  Research has also  examined rotary versus fixed-wing effects of this illusion in terms of the G-excess issues of fixed-wing and high yaw rates of rotary-wing.  Regardless of the airframe and on-set conditions, this illusion can be extremely difficult to ignore and incapacitating to an unsuspecting pilot. Figure 3.2.  Coriolis Illusion. 3.2.4.  The Leans (Figure 3.3).  This is the most common vestibular illusion and is caused by rolling  or  banking  the  aircraft  after  the  pilot  has  a  false  impression  of  the  true  vertical.  Surveys of rotary wing naval flyers and one division of Canadian Forces pilots respectively indicate  a  91%  rate  of  experiencing  the  leans  and  50%  with  disorientation  experience, primarily  the  leans.17   After  a  prolonged  turn  has  ceased,  the  pilot  may  perceive  the  roll  to wings level as a bank and turn in the opposite direction.  The effect causes pilots to lean in an attempt  to  assume  what  feels  like  a  vertical  posture.    Alternatively,  if  they  establish  a  very slow roll to  the left  that does not  stimulate the vestibular apparatus  and then roll rapidly to                                                   17  (Previc and Ercoline; 2004, 260)   22  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 the right to level flight, they may generate the false impression of only having rolled to the right; again, the leans may result.  The leans are most commonly felt when flying formation on the wing in  and out  of the weather or at  night.  Since the wingman’s attention is  on the flight  lead  and  not  on  the  attitude  display,  it  becomes  easy  for  the  vestibular  or somatosensory  system  to  provide  false  orientation  cues,  often  reinforced  by  false  ambient visual cues.  These false orientation cues can quickly convince the wingman of being in  an “unusual” attitude and cause a strong case of the leans.  To minimize the effects of the leans while  on  the  wing,  it  is  important  for  the  wingman  to  occasionally  cross-reference  the attitude display, without making a head movement if possible.  Thus, the pilot must use focal vision  to  overcome  the  false  cues  and  to  acquire  accurate  spatial  orientation  information.  Often pilots fail to believe that ‘the leans’ could actually contribute to a mishap, but a 2007 F-16 mishap occurred due to this illusion as one fairly recent example. AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   23  Figure 3.3.  The Leans. 3.2.5.  Gillingham (post-roll) Illusion.  This illusion occurs after completing a roll about the longitudinal axis.  What happens in this illusion is that in the absence of a horizon to provide ambient visual cues, the vestibular system induces the perception of adding further roll after the completion of a roll to counter the misperception of roll-reversal or decrease in bank.  For instance, a pilot rolls left with 45 degrees of bank, stops the roll, but then has the sensation to add additional left bank.  This illusion was specifically cited in a 2008 F-16 mishap.    24  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 3.3.  Somatogravic Illusions.  The otolith organs are responsible for a set of illusions known as somatogravic  illusions.    This  type  of  illusion  is  the  sensation  of  change  in  attitude  when  the otolith organs are stimulated by linear acceleration. 3.3.1.  Pitch  Illusions  (Figure  3.4).    Also  called  a  pitch-up  or  pitch-down  illusion  and sometimes called a dark-night take-off illusion.  This illusion is often noted in the US Navy during aircraft carrier launch operations, but it has also been attributed to commercial airline and  General  Aviation  accidents  during  take-offs  at  night.    A  false  nose  high  sensation  can occur when an aircraft accelerates forward in level flight.  This somatogravic illusion may be unrecognized  during  an  IMC  takeoff  or  missed  approach  acceleration  if  the  pilot  is  not concentrating on flying via instruments, while in impoverished visual conditions.  Correcting for this illusion during climb-out could cause the pilot to push over/dive the aircraft toward the ground as seen in Figure 3.4.  A false nose-down sensation can occur as a result of rapid deceleration in the weather. Figure 3.4.  Pitch-up Illusion. 3.3.2.  Inversion  illusion.  (Figure  3.5)    A  variant  of  somatogravic  illusion  is  the  inversion illusion,  in  which  G  forces  act  on  the  otolith  organs  to  give  the  pilot  transitioning  from  an upright position to one of feeling upside down.  Although the inversion illusion is of greatest magnitude in high-performance aircraft, it can occur in any aircraft abruptly leveling after a steep climb.  The pilot can overcome the illusion by paying attention to valid external visual references or to aircraft attitude instruments.  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   25  Figure 3.5.  Inversion Illusion.  3.3.3.  Elevator Illusion.  A quick reduction in descent is misperceived to be a climb, due to the translational motion after effect, and induce an unwarranted pitch-down by the pilot.  The opposite can also occur after an abrupt reduction in ascent, this may create a false sensation of a dive and induce an unwarranted pitch-up by the confused pilot. 3.3.4.  G-excess  Illusion.    The  G-excess  illusion  depends  on  otolith-organ  mechanisms.  When a pilot’s head is facing forward in a G-pulling turn, the G-excess effect causes a false perception  that  the  aircraft  has  tilted  backwards  (pitched  up).    In  the  absence  of  overriding visual cues, the pilot can make dangerous attitude control errors to correct for the G-excess illusion.   If the pilot  is  looking at  the “9 o’clock level” position while  in a left  turn, the G-excess  effect  would  create  the  illusion  the  pilot’s  direction  of  gaze  is  above  the  actual direction;  i.e.,  the  aircraft  is  in  less  of  a  bank  than  is  actually  the  case.    The  pilot  would compensate for the illusion by overbanking.  Because of the G-excess illusion, the pilot may be  in  a  bank  somewhat  greater  than  the  perceived  bank  angle,  and  feel  comfortable  in  it.  Even  though  the  initial  perceptual  error  may  be  small,  the  accumulation  of  erroneous compensatory  control  input  can  result  in  a  rapidly  developing  severe  overbank  and  the accompanying  earthward  velocity  vector.    Remember,  the  prime  time  for  the  G-excess illusion to happen is during any turning and looking maneuver. 3.4.  Nystagmus.  During  and  immediately  after  maneuvers  resulting  from  particularly  violent angular  accelerations,  such  as  spins  and  rapid  aileron  rolls,  the  vestibular  system  can  fail  to stabilize vision.  The eyes can exhibit an uncontrollable oscillatory movement called nystagmus.  This  eye  movement  generally  results  in  an  inability  to  focus  on  either  flight  instruments  or outside  visual  references.    Rolling  maneuvers  are  especially  likely  to  result  in  visual  blurring because of nystagmus.  Normally, nystagmus ceases several seconds after termination of angular acceleration.    Under  conditions  of  vestibular  dominance  and  high  task  loading,  nystagmus  and blurring  of  vision  can  persist  much  longer,  even  long  enough  to  prevent  recovery.    This  is another example of the merging between the vestibular and visual systems for orientation.   26  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 3.5.  Visual Illusions.  A wide variety of visual misperceptions are known to occur during flight, and  the  most  common  illusions  are  described  here.    When  flying  with  NVGs,  pilots  should  be aware  that  they  are  susceptible  to  the  same  visual  illusions  listed  below  but  with  additional variations.  The image intensification process of the goggles can intensify the illusion as well as the  ambient  light.    Reference  Chapter  4  of  this  publication  for  further  academic  discussion; operational  use  is  detailed  in  11-2MDS  and  tactical  guidance  for  each  MDS.    Many  of  the following illusions involve the loss of visual cues such as the horizon and terrain, or the visual environment is such that accurate depth and distance estimation is not possible. 3.5.1.  Decreased  Visibility:  Night  &  Weather.    This  first  listed  illusion  is  not  so  much  a specific  illusion,  but  an  environmental  condition  that  leads  to  various  forms  of  SD.    The condition of decreased visibility or impoverished visual cues, whether due to night conditions or  IMC,  relates  to  most  of  the  other  illusions  both  visual  and  vestibular.    Pilots  are  over-confident  in  their  visual  capabilities  and  this  often  sets  them  up  for  failure.    A  majority  of mishaps  occur  at  night,  and  it  should  not  be  surprising  to  learn  that  SD  results  within  60 seconds when attempting to fly straight and level with no visual cues. 3.5.2.  Blending of Earth and Sky.  At night with both aided and unaided vision, pilots may confuse ground lights with stars.  In doing so, the possibility exists of flying into the ground because the perceived horizon is below the actual horizon.  Pilots may also confuse unlighted areas of the earth with an overcast night sky.  If pilots erroneously perceive ground features (such as the seashore) as the horizon, they are in danger of flying into the unlighted water or terrain above it. 3.5.3.  False  Vertical  and  Horizontal  Cues.    Flying  over  sloping  cloud  decks  or  land  that slopes gradually upward into mountainous terrain often compels pilots to fly with their wings parallel to the slope, rather than wings-level, or to climb or descend with the slope.  A related phenomenon  is  the  disorientation  caused  by  the  aurora  borealis  in  which  false  vertical  and horizontal  cues  generated  by  the  aurora  result  in  attitude  confusion  in  pilots  trying  to  fly formation or refuel at night in northern regions.  This illusion has been called the visual form of  the  leans.    The  other  form  of  the  leans  is  primarily  the  result  of  semicircular  canal stimulation. 3.5.4.  Formation  Flying  Problems.    This  situation  is  especially  hazardous  during  night formation flights when the only outside reference is the lights of the lead aircraft.  Frequent cockpit instrument scans, to include altitude, are essential when taking “spacing.”  Keeping the leader’s lights in the same relative position on the windscreen does not ensure adequate horizontal  or  vertical  spacing,  nor  does  it  ensure  adequate  height  above  the  terrain.  Especially  during  deceleration,  when  aircraft  pitch  attitude  increases,  keeping  lead  in  the same position on the windscreen can cause a substantial loss of altitude.  Night intercepts are especially dangerous without frequent instrument crosschecks.  An overshoot and subsequent pullback  toward  lead  can  be  confusing  if  you  think  that  you  are  below  the  lights  when  in reality you are level (altitude-wise) with the lights but in a 90-degree bank.  A maneuver to offset  your aircraft to  one side or the other, or below, could  have disastrous results.  When displacement  is  behind  and  below  the  lead  aircraft,  the  misperception  of actual  altitude  has been termed the Dip Illusion. 3.5.5.  Inadvertent  Flight  into  IMC.    A  leading  cause  of  mishaps  in  General  Aviation,  this still can be a dangerous  situation to  USAF  aircrew if they  do not immediately  transition  to AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   27  their  instruments.    Often  inadvertent  flight  into  visibility  reducing  weather  results  in  an unusual  attitude,  and  results  in  SD  requiring  unusual  attitude  recognition  and  recovery procedures. 3.5.6.  Vection  Illusions.    A  sensation  of  self-motion  induced  by  relative  movement  of viewed objects is called vection.  Such sensations are frequently illusory, and can be of linear (translational) or angular (rotational) movement.   An example of a linear vection illusion is that of an adjacent automobile creeping forward at a stoplight and creating the sensation that one’s own vehicle is  creeping backwards.   In formation  flying, such illusions  are common.  An example of an angular vection illusion is the feeling of rotation one can experience when the revolving reflection of a rotating anti-collision light is viewed in fog or clouds. Induced motion illusion is the perceived motion to move the attitude indicator to the proper attitude.  Induced  motion  is  most  vivid  with  indiscernible  backgrounds  such  as  “black  hole” conditions.    Some  pilots  have  reported  that  they  used  their  fingertips  or  knees  to  move  the controls to minimize the illusion of objects that are not actually moving, when other objects are physically moving instead 3.5.7.  Visual  Autokinesis.    A  stationary  light  stared  at  for  6  to  12  seconds  in  the  dark  will appear  to  move.    This  phenomenon  can  cause  considerable  confusion  in  pilots  flying formation or rejoining on a tanker at night.  To minimize or overcome this phenomenon: (a) shift your gaze frequently to avoid prolonged fixation on the light, (b) view the target beside or  through,  and  in  reference  to,  a  relatively  stationary  structure  such  as  a  canopy  bow,  (c) make  eye,  head,  and  body  movements  to  try  to  destroy  the  illusion,  and  (d)  as  always, monitor the flight  instruments to  prevent  or resolve any  perceptual  conflict.    Increasing the brilliance, size, and number of lights, or causing the lights to flash, will diminish the effect of the autokinesis phenomenon. 3.5.8.  Flicker Vertigo.  Individuals can be susceptible to flickering lights, and can experience unusual  sensations  or  a  false  sense  of  motion  caused  by  the  passage  of  light  through propellers or rotor blades or by flashing strobe lights.  Light that flickers at frequencies from 4  to  20  times  per  second  can  produce  nausea,  dizziness,  convulsions,  and  even unconsciousness in susceptible individuals. 3.5.9.  Featureless Terrain (Figure 3.6).  These illusions are a more general category of visual illusions that consist of an environment that is lacking in both focal and ambient vision cues.  A featureless terrain environment (like a desert, large areas of snow, or a large body of water) does not have or, due to night conditions the pilot is unable to see, any terrain cues for depth and  distance  estimation.    What  happens  in  this  condition  is  that  the  pilot  eventually  finds themselves  flying  dangerously  low  to  the  ground  because  the  pilot  had  perceived  their altitude higher than actual.  Flying low-level over featureless terrain often leads a pilot below their planned altitude if the pilot fails to maintain their cross-check on their radar altimeter.  This illusion often contributes to mishaps, but can be sufficiently addressed during pre-flight planning and risk assessment of known environmental conditions.   28  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 Figure 3.6.  Example of Featureless Terrain (Detail Covered by Snow).  3.5.10.  Black  Hole  Illusion  (Figure  3.7).    The  Black  Hole  Illusion  is  a  sub-set  of  the featureless terrain illusion and pertains specifically to an approach and landing.  Conditions are  encountered  over  a  featureless  environment  such  as  when  flying  on  a  dark  night  over water  or  unlighted  terrain  with  an  indiscernible  horizon  toward  a  runway.    Poor  peripheral cues  or  even  a  lack  of  focal  vision  cues  for  relative  size  estimation  and  depth/distance information create the false perception in the pilot that they are too steep relative the normal 3  degree  glide-path.    The  pilot,  incorrectly  feeling  steep,  initiates  an  unwarranted  descent below the desired glide-path and consequently puts the aircraft in a dangerously low position relative to the terrain prior to the runway.  Situations may occur that the approach glide-path is so shallow the pilot “lands short” of the runway.  It can even occur if flying to a runway with approach lights and runway glide-path indications.  Often, the pilot’s preference to fly “visual”  and  not  back-up  the  approach  with  instruments  induces  a  pilot  into  an  unsafe  and shallow glide-path to the runway.  Consequently, it is highly recommended to always back-up your visual approach if flown during night or over featureless terrain. AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   29  Figure 3.7.  Black Hole Illusion18.  3.5.11.  White-out/Brown-out  (Figure  3.8).    This  condition  has  become  an  increasing problem, especially with helicopter operations in desert or snow-covered environments.  The brown-out results from an inability to properly perceive the environment when the downwash from the rotary blades kick-up debris to the point of completely obscuring vision.  There is some illusion of self-motion due to the swirling dust/snow that creates the false sensation that the  helicopter  is  moving  more  than  it  actually  is.    In  this  situation,  pilots  and  aircrew  are unaware  of  their  position  relative  to  the  ground  prior  to  landing.    They  also  are  unable  to monitor  lateral  drift,  and  although  they  may  maintain  safe  altitude  above  the  ground,  they may drift to the side significantly while in the cloud and collide with a natural or man-made obstacle.    The  removal  of  environmental  visual  cues  results  in  the  pilots  and  aircrew  not being able to perceive their movement in any direction.                                                  18  (Gibb, 2007)   30  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 Figure 3.8.  Brown-out Resulting From Rotor Downwash into Sand.  3.5.12.  Oculogyral  Illusion.    This  visual  “illusion”  is  experienced  while  trying  to  stay oriented  with  a  fixed  visual  field  or  target  during  movement  stimulating  the  semi-circular canals.  It  occurs  as  a  result  of  the  failure  of  the  static  visual  image  to  achieve  visual dominance over the motion experienced.19  These illusions can reinforce the sense of motion, as  the  apparent  movement  is  typically  in  the  direction  of  the  angular  acceleration experienced.20 3.5.13.  Terrain  Illusions.    Differing  terrain  texture  and  terrain  geography  can  result  in misperception  of  altitude  in  pilots.    Similar  to  the  featureless  terrain  illusions,  often  pilots flying  over  various  terrain  features  adapt  to  obstacles  of  one  relative  size  and  then misperceive other terrain objects, with the result of flying too low or possibly be induced into flying  higher  than  desired  depending  upon  the  changing  terrain.    This  is  called  a  size-constancy  illusion  in  terms  of  visual  perception.    For  instance,  a  pilot  may  keep  a  certain distance  above  the  ground  by  relying  on  clearance  over  large  trees.    However,  as  the  low-level navigation route continues, terrain changes and the large trees are replaced by smaller shrubs resulting in the pilot keeping that same altitude over shrubs significantly shorter than the trees.  The end result is flying at a much lower altitude relative to the terrain. 3.6.  Runway  Illusions  (Figures  3.  9  &  3.10).    Flying  towards  different  runways  of  various shapes  and  sizes  can  induce  steep  or  shallow  visual  approaches  if  the  runway  is  significantly different  from  what  a  pilot  is  familiar  with.    Also,  the  terrain  surrounding  a  runway  can  often trick pilots into flying dangerously shallow approaches or flying dangerously steep approaches.  These illusions often occur despite rich viewing environments. 3.6.1.  Runway  Ratio.    The  length  and  width  of  a  runway  (length/width  equals  ratio),  if significantly different from what a pilot is accustomed to, can induce four different scenarios.                                                  19  (Previc and Ercoline, 2004) 20  (AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2011-0003, 2011) AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   31  Figure 3.9.  Runway Illusions.  3.6.1.1.  High  Ratio  Approach  and  Landing.    A  high  ratio  runway  is  long  and  narrow, compared to the pilot’s usual landing runway ratio.  The pilot may perceive the runway as farther away than it truly is due to its smaller visual image and may choose to descend at a higher than appropriate rate.  This illusion occurs because the visual picture of long and narrow runway usually only occurs when the aircraft is still a great distance away in the pilot’s experience approaching his usual runway.  As the pilot gets closer to the high ratio runway, he or she may  realize the descent  rate is too  quick and the aircraft approach is now  too  shallow  and/or  too  low  relative  their  distance  to  the  runway.  A  hard  landing often results from this type of mistaken approach to a higher ratio runway.  This is similar to the black hole illusion. 3.6.1.2.  Low  Ratio  Approach  and  Landing.    A  low  ratio  runway  is  short  and  wide  and may induce a feeling as of being too low, causing the pilot to delay descent.  The result is often  a  steep  approach  to  the  normal  landing  point,  and  becomes  a  significant  problem due  to  limited  runway  length.    If  the  runway  has  a  smaller  ratio  than  the  pilot  usually experiences, visual point at which he or she usually begins landing will occur when the aircraft  is  still  too  high  to  safely  initiate  a  flare.    This  occurs  because  a  wide  runway perspective  is  an  image  usually  seen  when  just  about  to  touch  down  during  landing.  However, if the runway is unusually wide, the normal peripheral visual cues may trigger the pilot to flare when in fact they are still well above the runway, even as much as 100 feet in the air. 3.6.2.  Up-Sloped Runway.  If a runway is up-sloping and the pilot may fly too shallow of an approach.    This  is  because  the  pilot  may  feel  they  are  too  steep  relative  to  the  flat  terrain below  their  approach.    Usually  the  perception  of  looking  steep  to  a  runway  induces  the   32  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 unwarranted  descent  to  an  incorrect  shallow  approach  angle  to  the  aim-point,  similar  to  a black hole illusion-type approach.  This illusion can occur in rich viewing conditions or when combined with a black hole environment. 3.6.3.  Down-Sloped  Runway.    If  a  runway  has  a  slope  in  the  downward  direction,  it  can induce  the  perception  in  the  pilot  that  they  are  flying  too  shallow  toward  their  usual  aim-point.  To correct this false perception, the pilot incorrectly is induced into flying too steep of an approach.  An influence in this situation is not only the down-sloped runway but the flat terrain beneath the pilot as they make their approach.  The pilot assesses their altitude above the terrain to match their usual mental picture of their approach and over-corrects. 3.6.4.  Rising Terrain Prior to the Runway.  With up-sloping terrain to a flat runway, the pilot estimates their normal glide-path incorrectly relative to the terrain below prior to the runway, which puts the aircraft too shallow towards the runway. 3.6.5.  Down  Sloping  Terrain  prior  to  the  Runway.    With  down  sloping  terrain  prior  to  the runway, the pilot may fly too steep because the perception of the terrain being close to their current glide-path.  This in turn induces a steep approach relative to their aim-point. AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   33  Figure 3.10.  Runway Width and Slope Illusions21. 3.7.  Somatosensory Illusions.                                                  21  (FAA, 2012)    34  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 3.7.1.  The  Seat-of-the-Pants  Sense.    Pilots  can  be  deceived  if  they  interpret  the  pressure sensations experienced during flight as meaning the same thing they would in an earth bound situation  (i.e.,  pressure  on  the  seat-of-the-pants  indicates  down).    In  flight,  this  pressure sensation is misleading because during coordinated flight, the force resulting from centripetal acceleration  and  gravity  are  always  toward  the  floor  of  the  aircraft.    Thus,  pilots  can  never tell through the pressure sensors which direction is the true vertical. 3.7.2.  Giant Hand Illusion.  The giant hand phenomenon is a subconscious reflex behavior, generated  by  vestibular  or  somatosensory  inputs  that  interfere  with  the  pilot’s  conscious control of the aircraft.  This illusion gives the impression that some external force is pushing on the aircraft or holding it in a certain attitude.  When disorientation is primarily about the roll axis, as with the leans or graveyard spiral, the pilot may see deviation from the desired attitude  on  the  attitude  indicator,  apply  the  appropriate  stick  pressure  to  roll  the  aircraft  to reduce  the  unwanted  bank  angle,  and  discover  that  efforts  to  roll  the  aircraft  appear  to  be resisted.  The aircraft either seems to not let the pilot roll or, once the airplane has been rolled to  the  proper  attitude,  it  seems  to  roll  back  to  the  original  attitude  as  if  a  giant  hand  were pushing  a  wing  down.    When  the  disorientation  is  about  the  pitch  axis,  as  it  is  when  a somatogravic  illusion  of  pitch-up  occurs  during  forward  acceleration,  the  pilot  may experience what feels as excessive nose down trim and the aircraft appears to resist efforts by the pilot to pull the nose up, as if a giant hand were pushing the nose down.  There is little research  relating  to  our  understanding  of  the  giant  hand  illusion.    To  date  it  has  not  been satisfactorily reproduced on the ground. It appears to be most commonly experienced during night air refueling operations. 3.7.2.1.  Reflex Actions.  The giant  hand phenomenon is  thought  to  occur as a result of pilot  reflex  actions  during  disorientation.    Remember,  our  reflexes  are  geared  to  a ground-based environment and rely on vestibular and somatosensory inputs to determine orientation.  During disorientation, the desired control input is in conflict with the reflex input, giving the illusion of some external force acting on the aircraft. 3.7.2.2.  Overcoming  the  Giant  Hand.    To  overcome  the  giant  hand  illusion,  the  pilot should momentarily remove his or her hand from the control stick to interrupt the reflex response.    A  positive  effort  must  then  be  made  on  the  controls  to  move  the  attitude indicator to the proper attitude.  Some pilots have reported that they used their fingertips or  knees  to  move  the  controls  to  keep  the  illusion  dispelled.    Upon  transition  back  to holding the controls in the usual manner, the control anomaly returned.  Clearly, the pilot must be sufficiently knowledgeable about  the  giant  hand illusion to  suspect  it when the possibility of SD exists. 3.8.  Other Sensory Phenomena.  Fascination and resulting target hypnosis are often described as spatial disorientation, though these events are more correctly defined as anomalies of attention rather than alterations of perception.22  Fascination occurs when the pilot’s attention is  focused on one aspect of his flying tasks to the exclusion of others, particularly when the focused aspect is  new  or  particularly  challenging,  such  as  an  in-flight  emergency.    Mishaps  that  result  from fascination may be caused by target hypnosis, such as when a pilot is intently focused on NVG use  without  cross-referencing  instruments  to  verify  altitude  or  attitude.    The  concept  of  other sensory  phenomena  underscores  the  critical  connections  between  orientation  in  flight  and                                                  22  (USAFSAM-TR-85-31, 1985) AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   35  situational  awareness.    It  is  virtually  impossible  to  discuss  one  topic  in  flight  without understanding  the  impact  of  the  other.    In  many  cases,  spatial  disorientation  and  loss  of situational  awareness  have  been  used  as  interchangeable  concepts  by  mishap  investigation boards.  However, identification of a final cause in any mishap is critical to establishing effective prevention measures.   36  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 Chapter 4 AIDED NIGHT VISION IMPACTS TO ORIENTATION 4.1.  Introduction.  The most important sense used in flight is vision because it allows aircrew to quickly  ascertain  their  position  in  space.  Unfortunately,  when  transitioning  to  night  operations, visual  acuity  decreases  as  the  illumination  levels  are  reduced.    To  compensate  for  this  and improve the ability to operate in the night environment, the Air Force uses night vision devices (NVDs).  NVDs permit aircrew to operate more effectively in the low-illumination environment, but  NVDs  have  important  limitations.    Aircrew  must  recognize  the  limitations  and  exercise proper  planning,  good  training,  and  sound  judgment  discussed  in  this  chapter  and  in  device-specific training, to effectively exploit the night using NVGs. 4.2.  Dark  Adaptation.  Dark  adaptation  is  the  process  by  which  your  eyes  increase  their sensitivity  to  lower  levels  of  illumination.    People  adapt  to  the  dark  in  varying  degrees  and  at different rates.  For most people, the sensitivity of the eye increases roughly 10,000-fold during the first 30 minutes, with little increase after that time.  One of the variables that determines the time for dark adaptation to take place is the length of exposure to bright light.  If you have not been exposed to long periods of bright light, either through the use of sunglasses or spending the day  indoors,  you  will  likely  dark  adapt  normally.    On  the  other  hand,  if  you  are  exposed  to  a large amount of unfiltered white light during the day, dark adaptation will take much longer.  In extreme  cases  (snow-blindness  or  very  reflective  sand  and  water  conditions),  dark  adaptation may  not  be  possible  for  hours  or  even  days.    Under  normal  circumstances,  complete  dark adaptation is reached in approximately 30 minutes.  If the dark-adapted eye is then exposed to a bright  light,  the  sensitivity  of  that  eye  is  temporarily  impaired,  with  the  amount  of  impairment depending on the intensity and duration of the exposure.  Brief exposure to a bright light source can  have  minimal  effect  upon  night  vision  because  the  pulses  of  energy  are  of  such  short duration.    However,  exposure  to  a  bright  light  source  (e.g.,  lightning  or  flares)  for  longer  than one second can seriously impair your night vision.  Depending on the intensity and duration of exposure, recovery to  a previous level  of dark adaptation  can take anywhere between 5 and 45 minutes.  The average image luminance in a night vision goggle (NVG) is not particularly bright, and your eyes will be in an intermediate state of dark adaptation when viewing scenes of typical uniformity.  Once reaching this intermediate state and after discontinuing goggle use, it will take you approximately 5-10 minutes to regain full dark adaptation.  Consequently, NVG use should be discontinued for a period of time prior to your requiring full dark adaptation (e.g., performing a landing without the use of NVGs). 4.3.  Night Vision Device Systems.  Two types of night vision systems will be discussed in this chapter, forward looking infrared (FLIR) technology and night vision goggles (NVGs). 4.3.1.  FLIR technology is based on the fact that all objects warmer than absolute zero emit heat.    FLIR  can  discriminate  between  objects  with  a  temperature  of  less  than  one-degree difference,  or  of  the  same  temperature  if  they  emit  heat  at  different  rates.    The  rate  of emission  depends  upon  the  composition  of  individual  objects.    FLIR  sensors  detect  the differences in the thermal properties of these materials and create an image on either a head up  or  head  down  display.    This  process,  called  thermal  imaging,  is  presented  as  a monochromatic image for the aircrew that can be gray or green depending on the display. AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   37  4.3.2.  NVGs  provide  an  intensified  image  of  scenes  illuminated  by  ambient  energy  in  the night  environment.    Although  they  are  a  great  aid  to  aviators  conducting  night  operations, NVGs do not turn night into day.  The image provided by NVGs places limitations on critical aspects  of  human  visual  performance,  (i.e.  visual  acuity,  field-of-view,  contrast  sensitivity, and  motion/depth  perception).    These  limitations  combine  to  create  a  degraded  visual environment,  increase  cognitive  workload,  and  contribute  to  spatial  disorientation.    Proper training  and  extensive  experience  can  help  deal  with  these  limitations  and  reduce  the susceptibility  to  dangerous  situations.    Spatial  orientation  at  night  requires  conscious, complex  processing  of  data  from  cockpit  instruments  and  displays.    An  aggressive  NVG instrument  crosscheck  should  be  a  part  of  all  NVG  operations  regardless  of  illumination levels, flight altitudes or mission profiles.  In addition, an effective NVG scan (using constant head movements) compensates for the reduced NVG field-of-view and increases the external field  of  regard  of  the  aviator.    By  scanning  the  horizon  during  aggressive  maneuvering, aircrew  can  minimize  disorientation.    Both  the  instrument  crosscheck  and  an  effective scanning  technique  require  concentration  and  good  habit  patterns,  which  should  be emphasized  and  developed  during  training.    When  employed  under  appropriate  conditions, NVGs  enhance  orientation  by  providing  an  external  visual  scene  where  none  is  available without  the  goggles.    However,  NVG  operations  are  inherently  more  demanding  than comparable  day  missions  and  aircrew  must  fully  understand  the  limitations  on  human physiology and aircraft systems. 4.3.3.  Comparison  of  FLIR  and  NVG  (Table  4.1).    NVGs  and  FLIR  systems  are complementary sensors and can aid mission accomplishment through their integration. Table 4.1.  NVG and FLIR Comparisons. NVG Use reflected energy (visible light and near IR)  Use emitted energy (mid or far IR) Images reflective contrast Requires at least some illumination Penetrates moisture more effectively Attenuated by smoke, haze, and dust Images thermal contrast Totally independent of light Penetrates smoke Attenuated by moisture (humidity) FLIR 4.4.  The Night Environment. 4.4.1.  Electromagnetic  Spectrum  (see  Figure  4.1).    Areas  on  the  electromagnetic  spectrum represent both the light that stimulates the unaided eye and the energy intensified by NVGs.  The  human  eye  is  sensitive  to  the  visible  spectrum  (approximately  400  to  700  nm),  which progresses from violet to blue, green, yellow, orange, then red.  A substantial amount of near-infrared (IR) energy (approximately 700 nm to 900 nm) is present in the night sky, so NVGs were  designed  to  be  sensitive  to  both  visible  and  near-IR  wavelengths.    Thermal  imaging systems, such as forward- looking infrared (FLIR) devices, are sensitive to energy in the mid- and far-IR regions.   38  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 Figure 4.1.  The Electromagnetic Spectrum. 4.4.2.  Terms.  The following terms are used to describe properties of light:  4.4.2.1.  Illuminance.  Illuminance (illumination) refers to the amount of light that strikes an  object  or  surface  at  some  distance  from  the  source.    An  example  is  the  amount  of ambient light that strikes the ground from a light source. 4.4.2.2.  Luminance.  Luminance refers to the amount of light emitted or reflected from a surface  area.  An  example  is  the  apparent  brightness  of  a  surface  that  is  illuminated  by moonlight. 4.4.2.3.  Albedo.  Albedo is the ratio between luminance to illuminance, in other words, the  ratio  of  reflected  to  incident  electromagnetic  radiation.    Simply  put,  albedo  is  the fraction of light or other electromagnetic radiation reflected by a surface.  For example, a mirror would have an albedo of near 1 or 100% while something that is very dark (black) would have an albedo near zero.  Illumination from a light source may remain constant, but  the  luminance  of  different  terrain  features  or  objects  will  vary  depending  on  their different  albedos.    The  light  source  provides  illumination,  but  what  our  eyes  see,  and what NVGs intensify, is the energy reflected from objects and terrain. 4.4.2.4.  Contrast.    Contrast  is  a  measure  of  the  luminance  difference  between  two  or more  surfaces.    In  the  night  terrain  environment,  contrast  is  dependent  upon  differing albedo values for each type of terrain surface. 4.4.2.5.  Nanometer  (nm).    The  nanometer,  (1  billionth  meter)  is  a  measurement  of  the wavelength of radiant energy. 4.5.  Sources  of  Illumination.  Many  natural  and  artificial  sources  of  energy,  described  as environmental  and  cultural  lighting,  combine  to  illuminate  the  night  environment.    Natural sources  include  the  moon,  stars,  solar  light  and  other  atmospheric  reactions,  while  artificial sources include city lights, fires, weapons discharge, searchlights and/or flares. AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   39  4.5.1.  Moon.    When  present,  the  moon  is  the  primary  source  of  natural  illumination  in  the night  sky.    The  amount  of  moon  illumination  reaching  the  earth’s  surface  is  dependent  on moon elevation above the horizon (moon angle) and the lunar phase. 4.5.1.1.  Moon  angle.    Illumination  from  the  moon  is  greatest  when  the  moon  is  at  its highest  point  (zenith)  and  at  its  lowest  when  the  moon  is  just  above  the  horizon.    This effect is caused by absorption of energy as it travels through the atmosphere; at low moon angles  there  is  more  atmosphere  for  the  energy  to  penetrate  and  hence  more  energy absorption occurs.  Particulates in the atmosphere (e.g., fog, dust) will also increase this absorptive effect.  An additional problem associated with a low angle moon concerns the adverse effect it has on the NVG image.  The bright light source (moon) will degrade the image, making it difficult to see terrain detail such as ridgelines.  In fact, flying towards a low angle moon results in problems similar to those experienced when flying towards a low angle sun.  All these factors should be considered during mission planning. Mission planning  tools  often  incorporate  detailed  US  Naval  Observatory  data  into  reports; additional stand-alone resources can also be used to aid preparation. 4.5.1.2.  Phases  of  the  Moon.    Illumination  is  also  affected  by  the  phases  of  the  moon.  There are four distinct phases in the lunar cycle: new moon, first quarter, full moon and third  quarter.    For  a  period  of  time  during  the  new  moon  phase,  the  moon  is  in conjunction with the sun and the dark side of the moon faces earth.  However, this phase, which  lasts  about  8  days,  also  includes  periods  when  approximately  one  quarter  of  the moon’s  surface  is  illuminated.    A  relatively  low  light  level  is  characteristic  of  the  new moon  phase.    Following  the  new  moon  phase  is  the  first  quarter  (waxing)  moon  phase.  One  quarter  to  three  quarters  of  the  moon  disk  is  visible  during  this  phase,  which  lasts approximately 7 days, and good illumination is provided.  The full moon phase covers the period when more than three quarters of the moon disk is visible and lasts approximately 8 days. The third quarter (waning) moon is the last phase and lasts about 7 days. It covers the  time  period  when  three  quarters  to  one  quarter  moon  disk  illumination  is  present.  Good illumination is provided during this phase, though slightly less than during the first quarter due to the type of lunar surface (mountainous) being illuminated by the sun. The entire cycle is repeated each “lunar month,” which lasts approximately 29 days. A quarter moon equals 50 percent illumination, which is optimal for current NVG technology. 4.5.1.3.  Moon  Shadows.  Another  characteristic  of  the  changing  moon  position  is shadowing.  Moonlight creates shadows during nighttime just as sunlight does during the day.    However,  understanding  what  you  cannot  see  in  nighttime  shadows  is  critical  to NVG operations.  Since they contain little or no energy (and some energy must be present for  the  NVGs  to  provide  an  image),  shadows  can  completely  hide  obstructions  such  as ridgelines or towers, and may make it difficult to detect waypoints, targets, landing zones (LZ),  drop  zones  (DZ),  etc.    The  term  foreshadowing  refers  to  a  particular  shadowing situation in which near objects may be masked by the shadow created by a distant, higher object. Any of these effects can be a serious threat during low level flight. 4.5.2.  Stars.  The stars provide about 20 percent of the night sky illuminance on a moonless night.    They  contribute  some  visible  light,  but  most  of  their  contribution  is  in  the  form  of near-IR energy.  This means the majority of the energy is invisible to the human eye but is within the response range of NVG image intensifiers.   40  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 4.5.3.  Solar  Light.    Sky-glow  is  ambient  light  from  the  sun  that  can  adversely  affect  NVG operations up to 1 ½ hours after sunset and ½ hour prior to sunrise, depending on latitude and time of year.  For example, in Alaska sky-glow will have a prolonged effect during the time of year when the sun does not travel far below the horizon.  Sky-glow will affect the gain of the  goggle  and  thus  reduce  image  quality.    The  effect  is  similar  to  flying  into  a  sunset  and results in the loss of visual cues when looking either west (sunset) or east (sunrise). Mission planning should take sky-glow and its effects into consideration. 4.5.4.  Other  Background  Illumination.    The  greater  portion  (approximately  40  percent)  of energy  in  the  night  sky  originates  in  the  upper  atmosphere  and  is  produced  by  chemical reaction (ionization) processes.  Other minor sources of night illumination are the aurora and zodiacal light caused by the scattering of sunlight from interplanetary particulate matter. 4.5.5.  Artificial  Sources.    Lights  from  cities,  industrial  sites,  and  fires  are  also  sources  of illumination.    Light  from  missile  fly-out,  weapon  flashes,  flares,  and  explosions  can adversely affect NVG performance, but the effects are usually short lived due to the nature of the source (e.g., short 20mm/30mm bursts).  In this case, the goggle image would return to normal as soon as the offending light source disappears. 4.5.6.  Spectral  Sensitivity  (Figure  4.2).  One  of  the  concerns  is  the  difference  in  spectral sensitivity  between  the  unaided  eye  and  the  NVG.  The  display  setup  consists  of  five differently  colored  light  emitting  diodes,  arranged  according  to  the  rainbow,  from  blue  to green  to  yellow  to  orange  to  red.    The  NVG  image  is  monochrome,  showing  all  lights  as green.  The  NVG  is  particularly  sensitive  to  red  light,  also  sensitive  to  near-IR  light,  and relatively insensitive to blue and green light. 4.5.6.1.  Some  light-emitting  diode  (LED)  lights  do  not  produce  high  levels  of  near infrared  energy,  thus  spectral  sensitivity  under  NVG  may  change  from  incandescent lighting.  For instance, a red incandescent position light can be seen by the NVG due to spectral  “color” and near infrared energy being emitted.  The same red position light as an LED may not produce the same level of intensity in the NVG.  This potential decrease in intensity may render the LED light unperceivable under NVG’s, and could pose a risk to  the  operator.    This  highlights  one  reason  that  a  good  visual  scan  is  recommended  to compliment the NVG scan. Figure 4.2.  Effect of Lights with Different Colors.  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   41  4.6.  NVG Characteristics.  The NVG is an advanced night vision system.  The goggles chosen by  most  organizations  in  the  Air  Force  are  binocular-style,  helmet  mounted,  image intensification devices that amplify visible and near-IR energy (Figure 4.3).  This amplification is a passive process, meaning no emissions are created by the goggles themselves. Figure 4.3.  NVG Components and the Image Intensification Process. 4.6.1.  Basic  Components  of  the  Image  Intensifier  Tubes.    The  most  common  NVG  is  a lightweight, fully adjustable binocular assembly consisting of two monoculars, one for each eye.  Each monocular amplifies available ambient light and presents an intensified image to one eye.  Each monocular is comprised of the following components.  4.6.1.1.  Objective Lens.  The objective lens of each monocular consists of a combination of optical elements which focus the incoming photons of light onto the photocathode of the intensifier tube.  During this process the image is inverted. 4.6.1.2.  Photocathode.  The photocathode is the first element in an intensifier tube; it is a light-  sensitive  surface  onto  which  the  scene  being  viewed  is  focused  by  the  objective lens  of  the  monocular.    It  is  similar  to  the  film  in  a  camera.    It  is  made  of  gallium arsenide,  and  releases  electrons  when  photons  impact  it,  starting  the  intensification process.  In the photocathode, light is converted into electrical energy, which allows for the amplification that follows. 4.6.1.3.  Micro-channel  Plate.    The  micro-channel  plate  is  the  next  element  in  an intensifier  tube.    It  consists  of  a  thin  wafer  containing  millions  of  microscopic  glass tubules  that  channel  the  electrons  exiting  the  photocathode.    The  tube  walls  release multiple  electrons  when  an  electron  impacts  the  wall.    The  tubules  are  tilted  to  ensure electron  impact  with  the  tubule  wall.    The  result  is  a  “cascade  effect,”  which  is  an essential part of the intensification process.  As a result of this process, for every single electron that enters one of the tubules, over one thousand exit. 4.6.1.4.  Phosphor  Screen.    The  phosphor  screen  is  the  next  successive  element  in  an intensifier tube.  The screen is located on the front surface of the fiber optic inverter, next to the rear (exit) surface of the micro-channel plate, and consists of a chemical that emits energy  in  the  visible  spectrum  (light)  when  struck  by  electrons.    Thus,  as  the  electrons   42  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 exiting the micro-channel plate strike the phosphor, an image is created.  Due to the type of phosphor selected for NVGs, the resultant image is green. 4.6.1.5.  Fiber  Optic  Inverter.    The  fiber  optic  inverter  serves  to  convey  the  intensified image created on the phosphor screen to the output of the intensifier tube.  The inverter reorients the image that was inverted by the objective lens. 4.6.1.6.  Diopter (eyepiece) Lens.  The diopter lens is the final optical component of the image intensifier tube.  The lens is adjustable and focuses the image onto the retina. Figure 4.4.  Basic Night Vision Goggle Components. 4.6.2.  Procedures for adjusting and focusing NVGs  (Figure 4  4).  Begin by cleaning all four  lenses,  setting  the  diopter  adjustment  ring  settings  to  zero,  and  adjusting  the  tilt  lever parallel with the tube housing.  4.6.2.1.  Don the helmet and attach/lock the NVG assembly to the helmet mounted power transfer module (PTM, not pictured) in the up position. 4.6.2.2.  Press  the  lock  release  button  on  PTM  and  lower  the  NVG  assembly  into  the down position.  Use the vertical adjustment knob on the PTM to raise or lower the goggle assembly to level with the eyes. 4.6.2.3.  Adjust  the  horizontal  eye  relief  creating  one  inch  of  space  between  your  eyes and the diopter lenses (if done correctly  a shaded circle with  a silver ring lining  can be viewed looking through both monocular tubes). 4.6.2.4.  If  necessary,  adjust  the  Inter-Pupillary  Distance  (IPD)  knobs  moving  the monocular tube toward the shaded area to aid in aligning your visual axis with the NVG optical axis thus aiding the evidence of a shaded circle with the silver ring lining. 4.6.2.5.  At this point, the proper adjustments are made and the focusing procedures may be done using the ANV20/20 Hoffman Box.  Ensure the Hoffman Box is adjusted to the AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   43  proper height distance for the user.  Prior to powering the NVG ensure the lights are out in the surrounding area. 4.6.2.6.  Cover  one  objective  lens  with  a  cap.  Power  on  the  Hoffman  Box  and  while peering through the uncapped tube assess the image in the following manner: 4.6.2.6.1.  Adjust  the  objective  focus  ring  in  either  clockwise  or  counter  clockwise direction  until  you  can  identify  the  orientation  (vertical  or  horizontal)  of  the  coarse lines only (fine lines will not be in complete focus at this point.) 4.6.2.6.2.  Adjust  the  diopter  focus  ring  counter  clockwise  until  the  image  blurs, pause allowing time to let eye accommodate, then slowly turn the diopter focus ring in  the  clockwise  position  until  you  achieve  a  focused  image  (fine  lines  will  be  in focus at this point.) 4.6.2.7.  IAW TO 12S10-2AVS9-2, using the Hoffman tester in the high light setting it is recommended  that  the  user  attain  at  a  minimum  20/30  visual  acuity.    While  pushing  in and holding the low light function test button the user should attain a minimum of 20/35 visual  acuity.  See  Figure  4.5.    In  effect,  the  low  light  button  is  used  to  establish  the NVGs  will  perform  acceptably  under  low  illumination  conditions.    If  there’s  a  drastic drop off in VA, consider exchanging to another set of NVGs. Figure 4.5.  ANV- 20/20 Visual Acuity Box Image.  4.6.2.8.  The only adjustments after this point in  the focusing procedures are to be done with the objective lens. 4.6.2.9.  Repeat  steps 6-8 adjusting the focus rings of the other tube lenses allowing for image assessment.   44  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 4.6.3.  Assessment of Image.  The following image defects are typical deficiencies that can be  either  normal  or  defective  in  nature;  see  figure  4.6  for  illustrations  of  defects  described below.  It is important to understand the difference to determine the proper course of action. 4.6.3.1.  Shading.    Shading  is  a  condition  encountered  when  a  full  image  cannot  be obtained  and  a  dark  area  appears  along  the  edge  of  the  image.    Attempt  to  eliminate shading  by  readjusting  either  the  tilt  or  the  IPD,  or  by  shifting  the  helmet’s  position.  Shading  can  also  occur  as  a  result  of  a  shift  in  the  micro-channel  plate  caused  by  the goggles  being  dropped  or  handled  roughly.    If  shading  cannot  be  corrected  by readjustments or by repositioning the mounting bracket on the helmet, turn the goggles in for maintenance. 4.6.3.2.  Edge  glow.    Edge  glow  appears  as  a  bright  area  along  the  outer  edge  of  the image.  It can result from an incompatible light source outside the goggle FOV, a shift in the micro-channel  plate due to  mishandling, or a power supply problem  within the tube assembly.  If edge glow is noted, move your head or cup your hand around the periphery of the objective lens in an attempt to alleviate the condition.  If the edge glow does not disappear, turn the goggles in for maintenance. 4.6.3.3.  Honeycomb.    At  times  of  very  high  luminance,  a  hexagonal  (honeycomb) pattern may be visible across the intensified field of view.  This pattern is a result of the manufacturing process during which the fiber optic inverter is assembled within the tube.  Normally  it  is  faint  in  appearance  and  does  not  affect  NVG  performance.    Should  it appear  as  a  bold  outline  or  during  low  luminance  conditions,  turn  the  goggles  in  for maintenance. 4.6.3.4.  Bright  spots.    Bright  spots  are  the  result  of  irregular  emission  points  on  the photocathode, usually occurring during the manufacturing process.  Because these spots are  normally  detected  during  the  quality  control  process  at  the  manufacturer,  you  will seldom see them.  However, if an NVG has an excessive number of spots present in the image, or if the spots are distracting, turn the goggles in for maintenance. 4.6.3.5.  Dark  spots.    Dark  spots  are  simply  the  bright  spots  described  above  that  have been  corrected  at  the  manufacturing  facility.    This  correction  is  accomplished  by exposing the light spots to laser energy and burning out that portion of the photocathode.  Dark  spots  may  also  be  caused  by  material  allowed  to  enter  the  system  during maintenance.    NVG  acquisition  contracts  usually  include  a  specification  that  limits  the number, size, and location of dark spots.  Nevertheless, if you are distracted by the dark spots, even if the NVG is within specification, turn the goggles in for maintenance. 4.6.3.6.  Distortion.    The  two  most  common  types  of  distortion  are  bending  and  shear.  Bending distortion results in the image having a wavy appearance, usually in a horizontal or vertical  direction.  Shear distortion results in  a choppy appearance somewhere in  the image.    If  distortion  is  present  and  likely  to  interfere  with  normal  operations,  turn  the goggles in  for maintenance.  Flying with tube distortion can cause problems in distance and altitude estimations. 4.6.3.7.  Scintillation.  A sparkling effect normally occurs in the NVG image during low illumination conditions as a result of increased goggle gain and system noise.  In flight, it AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   45  can  be  an  indication  of  decreasing  illumination  caused  by  such  things  as  deteriorating weather conditions or flight into shadows. Figure 4.6.  NVG Image Defects. 4.7.  NVG Performance Characteristics.  4.7.1.  Gain.    Gain  refers  to  the  ratio  of  output  to  input,  or  the  amount  of  energy  the intensification  process  produces  relative  to  the  amount  that  entered  the  intensification process.    A  NVG  has  circuitry  that  determines  the  amount  of  energy  entering  the intensification  process,  and  this  circuitry  automatically  controls  the  level  of  intensification needed to produce images of consistent brightness over a wide range of illumination levels.  At some point, the ability of the intensifier to increase gain is reached and image brightness and quality begin to degrade.  Image degradation caused by lowering light levels can be very insidious and leads to problems for the aircrew. 4.7.2.  Image  color.    The  NVG  image  appears  in  shades  of  green.    Since  there  is  only  one color, the image is said to be monochromatic. 4.7.3.  Visual  performance.    When  compared  to  the  human  eye  under  daylight  conditions, your  vision  is  limited  while  utilizing  NVGs—detection  ranges  increase  and  recognition  of objects,  terrain  and  targets  can  be  severely  limited.   While  NVGs  can  be vastly  superior  to the human eyes’ performance under night conditions, NVGs DO NOT TURN NIGHT INTO DAY. 4.8.  NVG  Limitations.  The  following  visual  limitations  are  common  to  most  NVGs.    The limitations  of  NVG  are  not  as  obvious  as  the  characteristics  described  above  and  must  be learned. 4.8.1.  Field of view.  FOV refers to the total instantaneous area covered by the NVG image. Regardless of the type of NVG utilized, it is important to understand that the FOV it is able to  provide is  less than  your eye’s  FOV, particularly in  your peripheral  vision.   This  loss of peripheral vision is often a contributing factor in the onset of spatial disorientation.   46  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 4.8.2.  Resolution.  Resolution refers to the capability of the goggle to present an image that makes clear and distinguishable the separate components  of a scene or object.   Though not technically accurate, it is  easiest  to  discuss resolution in  terms  of Snellen visual acuity  (the same system used for vision testing during flight physicals).  Current NVGs have a resolution capability of 20/25 to 20/40 Snellen.  The resolution achieved with the Hoffman tester is the best;  during  flying  operations,  resolution  may  be  negatively  impacted  by  transmissivity, weather, lighting, etc.  Though quite an improvement for NVGs, the performance may still be less  than  20/20,  a  standard  accepted  as  “normal  day  vision.”    However,  NVG  performance far exceeds the eye’s unaided visual performance at night, which is approximately 20/200 to 20/400.  It should be noted that while NVGs have a rated acuity of 20/25 to 20/40 Snellen, this is the best an aircrew can expect to achieve under optimum conditions.  There are many factors  that  affect  NVG  operations  and  degrade  the  expected  acuity.    These  factors  are discussed in the next section.  NVGs will not correct for sight deficiencies such as myopia or astigmatism.    If  you  wear  glasses  during  the  day,  you  will  still  have  to  wear  them  when flying with NVGs to see properly. 4.8.3.  Depth  Perception  and  Distance  Estimation.    Depth  perception  is  the  ability  to determine where objects are located relative to each other, whereas distance estimation is the ability  to  determine  the  distance  to  something,  such  as  the  ground  or  a  target.    Depth  and distance  are  discussed  together  because  they  use  the  same  visual  cues—binocular  and monocular. 4.8.4.  Binocular  Cues.    An  aircrew’s  binocular  cues  are  usually  quite  degraded  due  to  the design of the goggle.  Binocular cues are needed for tasks relatively close (within an arm’s reach) and for tasks at distances up to approximately 200 feet.  Binocular cues, by definition, require  the  use  of  both  eyes  functioning  together  and  include  stereopsis,  vergence  and accommodation. 4.8.5.  Monocular Cues.  Monocular cues appear to be most important for deriving distance information while flying.  Monocular cues do not require the coordination of both eyes and are  available  beyond  the  distances  at  which  binocular  cues  are.    NVGs  adversely  affect monocular cues several ways.  The decreased resolution of the NVG image results in a loss of sharp contrast and definition, both helpful for determining depth and distance.  The limited FOV of the image diminishes depth and distance tasking by reducing the availability of cues.  Also,  anything  adversely  affecting  the  image  (e.g.,  low  illumination)  will  aggravate  the problem.  Examples of monocular cues used when flying include: 4.8.5.1.  Size constancy.  If two hangars are known to be equal in size, the one appearing smaller must be further away. 4.8.5.2.  Motion  parallax  (optical  flow).    Nearer  objects  appear  to  be  moving  past  more quickly than distant objects. 4.8.5.3.  Linear perspective.  The convergence of parallel lines at a distance. 4.9.  Avoiding  Depth  and  Distance  Problems.  Be aware that anything adversely affecting the NVG image will also adversely affect the assessment of depth and distance.  Avoid the tendency to  fly  lower  or  closer  in  order  to  see  more  detail.    Over  a  period  of  time,  an  aircrew  member “learns” how to assess depth and distance when flying in the same area.  However, the “learned” techniques  may  not  transfer  to  a  new  area  where  terrain  and  objects  might  be  completely AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   47  different in size and perspective.  In general, there is a tendency for aircrew to overestimate how well they can see when using NVGs. 4.9.1.  Contrast.  As with resolution, contrast in the NVG image is degraded relative to that perceived by the unaided eye during daytime.  Also, any bright light source within or near the NVGs  FOV  will  further  reduce  contrast  by  reducing  gain,  creating  veiling  glare  across  the image,  or  both.    Additionally,  there  are  differences  in  sensitivity  to  contrast  among crewmembers, which may lead to differences in image interpretation. 4.9.2.  Dynamic  Visual  Cues.    Dynamic  visual  cues  provide  information  that  helps  to determine direction, altitude and speed.  The three primary dynamic cues are: 4.9.2.1.  Static Cue Motion.  Static cue motion is the summed effect of the change in one or  more  of  the  static  cues  caused  by  aircraft  movement.    Static  cues  include  elevation, known  size,  and  perspective.    Central  vision  tracking  is  a  method  for  seeing  static  cue motion and will be degraded when using NVGs. 4.9.2.2.  Optical  Flow.    Optical  flow  is  the  angular  rate  and  direction  of  movement  of objects as a result of aircraft velocity measured relative to the aviator’s eye point.  This provides our visual system the information necessary to interpret speed and direction of motion.  If there is no relative motion, there is no optical flow. We use central vision to obtain optical flow information.  Since visual acuity is degraded with NVGs, the optical flow cues will be degraded when compared to daytime cues. 4.9.2.3.  Peripheral Vision Motion.  Peripheral vision motion is a subconscious method of detecting optical flow.  It is dependent on a wide FOV and is the primary attitude sensory input.  With the reduction in FOV due to NVGs, this cue is severely degraded and central vision tracking becomes the primary attitude detection means.  This  leads to  one of the most than expected/allowed  altitude.    Just  as  in  the  day,  visual  acuity  will  improve  as  the  aircraft gets closer to the ground.  However, because of the reduction in peripheral vision motion, the ensuing “speed rush” that would indicate close proximity to  the  ground is  degraded and controlled flight into terrain becomes a real danger. low  altitude—flying  at  a lower insidious  dangers  when flying 4.9.3.  NVG Scan.  The reduction in FOV necessitates an active, aggressive scan on the part of the NVG wearer.  By continually scanning, aircrew members increase their field of regard by  increasing  the  mental  image  of  the  surrounding  terrain,  aircraft,  and  cultural  features.  This information can then be compared and added to the aircraft flight instruments.  Aircrew members should establish a scan pattern that allows information from outside the cockpit to be merged with  cockpit  flight  instrumentation.    Fixating in  one direction may be necessary for a short duration (e.g., identifying a waypoint), but the scan should be continued after just a  few  seconds.    A  crewmember’s  scan  pattern  may  be  disrupted  during  high  cockpit workloads or when fatigued.  Under these conditions, an extra emphasis needs to be given to the scan pattern, especially keeping the horizon in the field of regard. 4.9.4.  Preflight Adjustment and Assessment.  Following proper NVG adjustment procedures prior to each flight is imperative to ensure a safe and effective operational capability.  Even a small error in goggle adjustment can significantly degrade NVG visual acuity.  The problem is  compounded  by  the  fact  that  it  is  nearly  impossible  to  measure  a  loss  in  visual  acuity   48  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 without a controlled test environment, which means you can lose visual performance and not realize it. 4.10.  Factors Affecting NVG Operations. 4.10.1.  Cockpit Lighting.  NVG compatible cockpit lighting allows the crewmember to see cockpit instruments underneath the NVG while not measurably affecting NVG performance.  Although NVG filters allow the use of cockpit lighting that will not adversely affect gain and image  quality,  unfiltered  aircraft  lighting  is  incompatible.    If  the  lighting  is  not  properly modified,  it  will  emit  wavelengths  that  affect  NVG  performance.    There  are  aircraft  in  the inventory that have not been fully modified to be NVG compatible.  The following points are provided for clarification: 4.10.1.1.  Just because a light is green or blue does not mean it is compatible.  When the filament  in  a  light  glows,  it  releases  a  significant  amount  of  near-IR  energy  which  will affect NVG gain and performance.  Light bulbs and other energy sources in the cockpit must be modified in some manner to block the emission of all energy to which NVGs are sensitive in order to make them NVG compatible. 4.10.1.2.  Turning  down  the  brightness  of  incompatible  cockpit  lighting  will  not  make them  compatible  because  NVGs  are  also  sensitive  to  the  near-IR  energy  emitted  by  the lights.    Attempting  to  turn  down  lighting  to  reduce  the  effect  on  goggles  can  be  a  two edged  sword—the  NVG  image  will  still  be  degraded  and  vital  instruments  may  not  be readable with the unaided eye for several seconds. 4.10.1.3.  An incompatible light does not have to be within the NVG FOV for it to have an  effect  on  gain.    MAJCOMs  have  specific  lighting  modification  procedures  if  your aircraft  cockpit  lighting  is  not  NVG  compatible.    When  modifying  your  cockpit, remember  that  AFI  11-  202  Volume  3  requires  you  to  always  have  primary  flight instrumentation  present  and  properly  illuminated.    It  must  provide  full-time  attitude, altitude,  and  airspeed  information;  an  immediately  discernible  attitude  recognition capability; an unusual attitude recovery capability; and complete fault indications. 4.10.2.  Transparency  Transmissivity.    Another  impact  on  NVG  performance  is  the degradation caused by windscreens, canopies, or other transparencies through which aircrew must  look.    Some  transparencies  transmit  visible  wavelengths  fairly  well,  but  near-IR wavelengths very poorly.  Since NVGs are sensitive to near-IR wavelengths, transparencies that “trap” much of that  energy will degrade  NVG performance.  All  transparencies absorb near-IR energy to some extent, so there will be some goggle degradation in your cockpit. 4.10.3.  Weather  and  Visibility  Factors.  Any  atmospheric  condition  which  absorbs, scatters,  or  refracts  illumination,  either  before  or  after  it  strikes  the  terrain,  will  effectively reduce the usable energy available to the NVG.  This reduction, in turn, degrades our ability to  see  key  features  critical  for  flight.    The  exact  amount  of  reduction  is  difficult  to  predict because a common factor cannot be applied to each condition. 4.10.3.1.  Clouds.  In general, NVGs easily “see” clouds that are dense but may not see clouds that are less dense.  In the case of the more dense clouds, both visible and near-IR energy is reflected and the NVG can see the cloud (just as you can see the cloud unaided if there is enough light), especially if silhouetted against the night sky.  However, dense clouds  will  reduce  the  amount  of  illumination  striking  the  ground  and  therefore  reduce AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   49  the luminance available for NVG use.  Thin (less dense) clouds have more space between their particles.  Because the near-IR wavelength is slightly longer, it has a greater chance of  passing  through  these  type  clouds  than  does  the  shorter  visible  wavelength.    It  is possible  for  the  thin  and  wispy  clouds  (which  may  be  seen  with  the  naked  eye  during daytime)  to  be  invisible  when  viewed  through  the  NVG.    This  potential  invisibility  is possible  given  three  conditions:    The  clouds  are  less  dense  and  are  low  level,  set  in against  the  terrain  rather  than  being  silhouetted  against  the  night  sky,  and  ambient illumination is either very high or very low.  NOTE:  The invisibility of thin clouds can create a severe hazard for NVG operations.  Even though a cloud is “invisible,” you may not be able to see the terrain behind it because the cloud reduces luminance, which in turn reduces  scene  contrast  and  texture.    This  may,  in  turn,  produce  a  false  perception  of distance, resulting in  the pilot  either not  seeing the terrain  or thinking it is farther away than  it  actually  is.    Additionally,  the  cloud  may  get  progressively  thicker,  allowing  the pilot to progress into the cloud without initially perceiving it or the terrain beyond.  If a cloud is detected, the perception may be that it is at a distance. 4.10.3.2.  Fog.    Fog  is  another  atmospheric  condition  of  concern  for  the  NVG  operator.  Its effects on goggles are similar to those of clouds, but there is a greater tendency for fog to  be  less  dense  and  therefore  more  of  a  problem.    It  is  important  to  know  when  and where  fog  may  form  in  your  flying  area.    Typically,  coastal  and  mountainous  areas  are most susceptible. 4.10.3.3.  Rain.  Like clouds, the effect rain may have on goggle performance depends on the  type  of  conditions  encountered.    Droplet  size  and  density  are  key  ingredients  to  its visibility or invisibility.  Light  rain or mist may  not be seen with NVGs, but will affect contrast, distance estimation, and depth perception.  Heavy rain is more easily perceived due to the large droplet size and energy attenuation. 4.10.3.4.  Snow.    Snow  occurs  in  a  wide  range  of  particle  sizes,  shapes,  and  densities.  Snow crystals, while small in size, are generally large in comparison to the wavelength of visible light and near-IR energy, and will easily block or scatter those wavelengths.  As with  clouds,  rain,  and  fog,  the  more  dense  the  airborne  snow,  the  greater  the  effect  on NVG  performance.    On  the  ground,  snow  has  a  mixed  effect  depending  on  terrain  type and the illumination level.  In mountainous terrain, snow may add contrast, especially if trees  and  rocks  protrude  through  the  snow.    In  flatter  terrain,  snow  may  cover  high contrast areas, reducing them to areas of low contrast.  On low illumination nights, snow may  reflect  the  available  energy  better  than  the  terrain  it  covers  and  thus  increase  the level of illumination. 4.10.3.5.  Sand,  Dust,  Smoke  and  Similar  Obscurants.    The  effect  of  sand,  dust,  smoke and  similar  obscurants  is  similar  to  that  created  by  the  weather  factors.    However,  the individual particulates in these obscurants are usually far more dense, which means they can block energy even if less concentrated. 4.10.4.  All  the  atmospheric  conditions  described  above  reduce  illumination  levels.  Recognition  of  this  reduction  in  the  cockpit  is  very  difficult.    The  change  is  often  a  very subtle reduction in contrast that is not easily perceived with NVGs.  Cues can be very subtle and  the  crewmember  will  have  to  stay  aware  to  catch  their  significance.    Common  cues  to reductions in ambient illumination due to visibility restrictions include loss of celestial lights,   50  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 loss  of  ground  lights,  reduced  contrast,  reduced  depth  perception  or  distance  cues,  reduced acuity  or  resolution,  increased  graininess  or  scintillation,  and  a  more  pronounced  “halo” effect around incompatible light sources outside the aircraft. 4.10.5.  Cockpit  lighting,  weather,  transparency  effects,  the  illumination  level,  and  terrain type all have an effect on NVG performance.  The visual acuity you achieve in the eye lane will usually not be what you get in the aircraft during the mission—it will usually be less.  It is  therefore  imperative  you  maximize  NVG  performance  before  flight  and  avoid  doing anything to the goggle during flight to disrupt it (e.g., readjust the diopter).  Maximizing the NVGs performance will help offset the negative effects discussed. 4.11.  Night  Operations  with  NVGs.  The NVG environment is always changing, so you must always be aware of what cues are presented and work to interpret them.  Even then, beware of the  potential  misperceptions  or  illusions  in  any  NVG  scene.    Many  terrain  characteristics influence our ability to see features or objects and distinguish differences.  Due to the variability of the weather, the illumination level, and the moon angle, any given scene may look radically different  on  consecutive  nights.    A  basic  understanding  of  NVG  operations  requires  the crewmember  to  blend  the  following  considerations  with  an  awareness  of  those  changing conditions over different types of terrain. 4.11.1.  Terrain  Albedo  (Reflectivity).    Differences  in  terrain  albedo,  or  reflectivity,  will greatly  influence  luminance.    For  example,  surfaces  such  as  snow  will  reflect  more  energy than  surfaces  like  asphalt  or  dark  rock.    Since  NVGs  intensify  reflected  energy,  different albedos become critical in interpreting the NVG scene.  Albedo will also vary with specific conditions of terrain even though the terrain type remains constant.  For instance, dry sand is twice as reflective as wet sand. 4.11.2.  Terrain  Contrast.    Terrain  contrast  is  a  measure  of  the  difference  between  the reflectivity  of  two  or  more  surfaces.    The  greater  the  differences  in  contrast,  the  more “normal” the scene appears in the NVG image, and the easier it becomes to pick out objects.  Contrast generally improves with higher light levels, but there comes a point where there is actually too much light.   This is usually noted when flying over low contrast terrain during high  illumination  conditions.    Normally,  however,  as  the  ambient  light  level  increases, overall  definition  is  improved.    Some  examples  of  the  effects  of  contrast  in  varying conditions are below. 4.11.3.  Roads.    The  ability  to  detect  roads  with  goggles  depends  primarily  on  the  albedo difference between the road and the surrounding terrain.  For example, the highly reflective surface of  a concrete highway is  easily identified in  a  grassy  area during  most illumination levels because of the difference in their albedos.  However, asphalt roads are usually difficult to identify in heavily vegetated areas because both the asphalt road and the vegetation absorb available  energy,  and  therefore  have  similar  albedos.    Conversely,  in  desert  areas  the reflective sand can make asphalt roads easily detectable. 4.11.4.  Water.  Still water, when seen with NVGs, normally looks dark when viewed at high angles from higher altitudes.  Under low illumination, there is very little contrast between a vegetated landmass and a body of water.  In desert areas, lakes and small bodies of water are normally detectable as a dark area in a light background.  Lakes in a forested area are more difficult  to  detect  due  to  the  low  reflectivity  of  the  surrounding  terrain.    As  light  levels increase,  land-water  contrast  increases.    Due  to  the  reflective  nature  of  water,  when  over-AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   51  flying large bodies of calm water, the stars appear to move across the surface as the angle of reflection is changed by the movement of the aircraft.  This phenomenon may contribute to or induce the onset of spatial disorientation.  Any action on the water caused by wind, such as white caps, may improve the contrast, aiding in surface identification.  Over the ocean, the normal wave action breaks up reflections, thus reducing the problem.  As in non-NVG flight, however,  all  night    flight  over  open  water  is  best  performed  with  a  heavier  reliance  on primary instruments. 4.11.5.  Open  fields.    Contrast  is  usually  very  good  over  fields  that  are  tended  for  crops.  Various  types  of  vegetation  differ  widely  in  their  near-IR  reflectance  characteristics.    For example, due to differences in the near-IR reflectance of chlorophyll, an oak tree will appear brighter than a pine tree.  The same holds for crops.  However, if flying over a large area of similar  vegetation,  contrast  will  be  reduced.    Additionally,  the  differences  in  the  surface texture  due  to  plowing  are  very  apparent.    A  freshly  plowed  field  may  lack  vegetation,  but may produce a good NVG image when the coarse texture of the upturned soil contrasts well with the relatively undisturbed soil between the rows. 4.11.6.  Desert.  Open desert without vegetation can produce a washed-out NVG image.  This is  due to  the high reflectivity of the sand and poor contrast  offered by the lack of different albedos in the scene.  Desert environments which have bushes, low trees, and cacti provide better contrast cues, allowing for more detail in the image.  In general, flying over this type of terrain is similar to flying over water and is best accomplished with more reliance on your instruments. 4.11.7.  Mountain  Ranges.    Normally,  mountain  ranges  can  easily  be  identified  by  contrast between  the  lower  reflectivity  of  the  mountains  with  a  lighter,  more  reflective  desert  floor.  However,  if  ridges  between  your  aircraft  and  a  distant  ridge  have  similar  albedos,  the intermediate ridges can for all practical purposes be “invisible.”  Low, rolling terrain with the same  reflectivity  as  the  surrounding  terrain  can  also  blend  together  and  be  difficult  to distinguish.  These effects are more pronounced in low-light situations, but can occur under any conditions. 4.11.8.  Forested  areas.    Heavily  forested  areas  do  not  reflect  energy  efficiently,  and  solid canopied  forests  or  jungles  look  like  a  dark  mass  at  night.    Excellent  contrast  does  exist between  deciduous  (leafy)  and  coniferous  (pines,  firs,  etc.)  trees  as  well  as  between  open fields, exposed rocks, and surrounding forest areas. 4.11.9.  Snow.  Fresh, wet snow reflects approximately 85 percent of the energy reaching it, thus  providing  the  best  natural  reflectivity  of  any  terrain  surface.    Under  high  illumination, this can provide excessive light which can, in turn, lower intensifier tube output and decrease resolution.    During  periods  of  predicted  low  illumination  conditions,  snow  may  add  to  the illumination  level.  Snow  on  the  ground  can  also  be  a  factor  for  flight  planning;  landmark recognition may be difficult if deep snow obscures prominent terrain features. 4.11.10.  Terrain  Shadows.    Shadows  form  at  night  just  as  they  do  during  the  day,  and anything blocking moonlight will create a shadow.  The amount of terrain obscuration within a shaded area is dependent on the amount of ambient illumination and relative position of the moon.  The smaller the moon disc, the darker the shadowed area and the more difficult to see detail.  However, never plan on seeing any terrain features within shadows, regardless of the moon disc size.   52  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 4.12.  NVG  Misperceptions  and  Illusions.  While  most  misperceptions  and illusions encountered during NVG operations are simply a carryover of those experienced during daytime flight,  others  are  specific  to  the  NVGs  themselves.    Reduced  resolution,  limited  field  of  view, and  susceptibility  to  obscurants  can  intensify  misperceptions  and  illusions.    The  most  common NVG misperceptions and illusions are discussed below. 4.12.1.  Depth  Perception  and  Distance  Estimation  Errors.    A  common  belief  is  that  depth perception (DP) and distance estimation (DE) capabilities do not exist when using NVGs.  It is  true that these abilities are degraded by environmental  conditions  and goggle limitations, but  techniques can be developed to  assess depth  and distance.  The  most  helpful depth  and distance cues are those with which the aircrew is most familiar.  Flying over familiar terrain and culture features can  reduce DP  and DE errors.  When flying over different  terrain  with unfamiliar  features,  serious  errors  in  DP  and  DE  can  develop.    For  example,  if  someone normally flies over terrain with 30 foot trees, but is then deployed to an area populated with 5 foot shrubs, aircrew may fly lower than normal trying to make the scene look as it normally does.  Using visual information alone, that person would likely think they were higher than they  actually  were.    In  this  situation,  bringing  a  radar  altimeter  into  the  cross-check  would help minimize the effects of the illusion.  Overall, the best way to train for the lack of DP and DE cueing is through proper planning, training, and a good discussion of differences between the  deployed  location  and  the  normal  area  of  operations.    Training  over  a  wide  variety  of terrain,  features,  and  illumination  levels  can  build  the  experience  level  of  the  aircrew  to handle  varying  situations.    Additionally,  a  thorough  pre-brief  should  be  incorporated  to familiarize aircrew with the cues expected in the area of NVG operations.  Be aware that a light source’s halo intensity is not an accurate representation of its distance from the aircraft. The various wavelengths of light affect halo size significantly.  When viewing light sources with  NVGs,  a  technique  that  may  help  DP  and  DE  is  to  look  at  the  source  with  unaided vision.  By looking underneath or around the goggles, not only can colors be determined, but the  halo  effect  produced  by  the  NVGs  is  eliminated.    This  additional  information  can  be combined with the information presented in the NVG scene to improve the accuracy of your assessments. 4.12.2.  Terrain Contour Misperceptions.  Terrain contour misperceptions are exaggerated by anything  that  degrades  the  NVG  image.    The  following  are  a  few  techniques  to  aid  the aircrew in correct terrain perception. 4.12.2.1.  Discriminating  Between  Near  and  Distant  Terrain.    One  way  to  discriminate between near and distant terrain that contain little contrast difference is being attentive to motion parallax between the two.  For example, a hidden ridgeline close to  you may be highlighted by noting its movement relative to a distant, higher mountain. 4.12.2.2.  Gradual Changes in Terrain Elevation.  Gradually rising or descending terrain can  be  very  difficult  to  assess  when  the  terrain  is  low  contrast.    It  becomes  even  more difficult  when  there  are  few  cultural  features  available  for  comparison.    To  aid  in detection  of  the  gradual  changes,  an  aggressive  NVG  scan  must  be  maintained.    By scanning  aggressively,  indicators  of  changes  in  terrain  elevation  may  be  picked  up  in areas  other  than  directly  in  line  with  the  flight  path.    Also,  an  aggressive  instrument scan—when  altitude,  mission,  and  terrain  type  allow—can  provide  additional  inputs  to the developing situation. AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   53  4.12.2.3.  Maintaining Scene Detail.  If for any reason scene detail is reduced, there may be a tendency to fly lower in an attempt to regain the lost detail.  In the worst case, this can  lead  to  ground  impact.    Examples  of  when  scene  detail  can  be  reduced  include transitioning from an area of high contrast to one of low contrast, or when transitioning from an area of high illumination to an area of low illumination. 4.12.2.4.  Undetected  or  Illusory  Motion.    Motion  illusions  experienced  by  aircrews  are usually due to flights over areas of reduced contrast, or a sudden loss of contrast and flow cues.  This  can result from the lack of perceived “flow” information in the NVG image and may create the illusion that the aircraft has slowed down or stopped.  This situation can induce spatial disorientation, especially if coupled with other factors such as loss of the  horizon.    An  increased  instrument  scan  will  help  alleviate  the  problem.    Another insidious aspect of undetected motion is when an aircrew perceives they are motionless.  Helicopter  crews  hovering  over  low  contrast  terrain,  whether  a  large  field  or  over  open water, can actually be moving at fairly high speeds without knowing it.  Without cues to provide  stimulus  to  the  visual  system,  this  movement  can  go  undetected  and  is  very dangerous.    Again,  this  is  a  known  problem  even  during  daytime,  but  the  decreased resolution and FOV of the NVG image can accentuate the effects. 4.12.2.5.  False  Perspective.    Halos  and  the  dominance  of  light  sources  can  cause  a dramatically  distorted  NVG  depth  perception.  This  can  be  shown  by  a  wire  frame  to which  several  light  sources  have  been  attached  (Figure  4.7).  With  the  naked  eye  the correct geometry is apparent, but with the NVG the perceived geometry flips. When the observer  moves  sideways  it  appears  as  if  the  construction  becomes  fluid:  the  geometry distorts.  The  correct  perspective  does  not  re-appear  as  is  usually  the  case  with geometrical  illusions.  This  demonstration  is  particularly  powerful  because  the  viewer cannot overcome the illusion even when he or she is aware of the correct geometry. Figure 4.7.  Line of Sight. 4.12.3.  NVG Flight Over Water.  Flight over water is particularly dangerous with NVGs due to the significantly reduced contrast, absence of features, and lack of motion cues in the NVG image.    Also,  a  frequent  cause  of  SD  with  NVGs  has  been  the  reflection  of  stars  by  water surfaces.  Hazy conditions over water can cause disorientation and force almost total reliance on  flight  instruments.    Therefore,  NVG  flight  over  water  must  be  conducted  with  an increased reliance on instruments as if the aircraft were in  IMC.  Because of the number of illusions  that  can  occur,  extraordinary  vigilance  must  be  maintained  in  the  aircrew’s    54  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 crosscheck  between  outside  visual  references  and  instrument  references  to  prevent misinterpretation of the NVG scene. 4.12.4.  Inadvertent  Flight  into  IMC  with  NVGs.    A  particularly  hazardous  regime  exists when flying with NVGs in weather conditions conducive to the formation of thin clouds or fog.    NVGs  are  primarily  sensitive  to  near  infrared  energy,  which  is  poorly  reflected  by moisture. Aircrew using NVGs will be able to detect dense clouds or fog, especially clouds silhouetted against a clear sky.  However, thin clouds or light fog may not be perceived.  It is possible to enter IMC without ever detecting its presence while utilizing NVGs.  To combat this  phenomenon,  NVG  aircrew  must  be  aware  of  the  increase  in  scintillation  in  the  NVG image,  indicating  a  decrease  in  the  level  of  brightness  of  the  NVG  image.    As  the illumination level decreases with the increasing cloud cover, the automatic brightness control in  the  goggle  adjusts  to  maintain  constant  image  luminance.    However,  as  illumination conditions  worsen,  NVG  image  luminance  can  gradually  decrease.    The  NVG  user  may continuously adapt to decreases in image luminance and fail to notice the subtle changes in scene  brightness.    In  these  conditions  the  NVG  aircrew  must  interpret  the  increase  in scintillation in the NVG image as the primary warning that environmental conditions may be deteriorating. 4.12.5.  Recommendations.  Susceptibility  to  illusions  and  misperceptions  can  be  lessened by maximizing visual acuity.  The best way to accomplish this is through effective training as well  as  proper  preflight  adjustment  and  assessment  of  the  goggles  to  ensure  the  best  NVG image.    In-flight  attentiveness  is  another  building  block  to  ensure  NVG  effectiveness.    As stated earlier, reliance solely on visual cues will nearly always result in a flight path that is lower,  closer,  or  steeper  than  intended,  so  the  aircraft  instruments  must  be  readable  and included in your cross-check.  Use all information available to you, not just one piece of the puzzle.  By using the entire picture, you lessen the likelihood of relying too much on NVGs.  As  usual,  an  aggressive  scan  is  required  to  maintain  situational  awareness  and  spatial orientation. 4.13.  Emergency  Situations.  In  general,  consider  the  type  of  emergency  and  what  actions might be required from the pilot or the crew.  If the NVGs will not be useful during emergency procedures, consider removing them.  However, if you can still gain valuable information from the NVGs, aircrews may continue to use them. 4.13.1.  Ejection.    Ejection  seat  aircrew  members  must  remove  the  NVGs  prior  to  ejection unless  they  are  ejection  seat  compatible.    During  the  ejection  sequence,  with  the  NVGs  in place on the helmet, fatal neck injuries or skull fractures can occur due to the forward center of gravity and weight of the goggles.  For this reason, aircrew should not leave their NVGs in a  raised  position  during  emergencies  that  may  lead  to  an  ejection.    It  is  probable  they  will forget they are wearing them as they manage this highly stressful situation. 4.13.2.  Inadvertent IMC.  One of the most dangerous situations that can be experienced with NVGs is flight into undetected meteorological conditions.  The inability of the NVGs to see various  areas  of  moisture  can  lull  the  aircrew  to  continue  further  into  instrument meteorological  conditions  (IMC)  to  a  point  where  there  is  virtually  no  visual  information.  This  can  result  in  a  gradual  loss  of  scene  detail  and  place  the  aircrew  in  an  area  of  heavy moisture  and,  in  the  low-  level  environment,  place  the  aircrew  in  a  potential  conflict  with masked terrain.  The following NVG cues will help alert you to impending IMC: AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   55  4.13.2.1.  Halos surrounding incompatible light sources outside the cockpit (e.g., external lights  from  another  aircraft)  may  change  in  appearance.    Normally  sharp  edges  to  the halos  can become less  distinct and the halo  may appear larger due to  energy dispersion from the moisture. 4.13.2.2.  A gradual loss of scene detail, visual acuity, or terrain contrast. 4.13.2.3.  Partial or complete obscuration of the moon and stars. 4.13.2.4.  An increase in scintillation. 4.13.2.5.  The  glow  or  flash  from  your  aircraft  external lights/searchlights may become visible or intensify. lights/strobes/landing 4.13.2.6.  Looking  underneath  or  around  the  NVGs  with  the  unaided  eye  can  aid  in detecting IMC, but be aware that you can be in precipitation without seeing it in the NVG image.  Use all the cues available to you. 4.14.  Spatial  Disorientation.  Spatial  disorientation  can  occur  at  any  time  during  flight.  Although  NVGs  usually  improve  situational  awareness  and  reduce  the  possibility  of  spatial disorientation, they can also enhance momentary disorientation.  This is due to the limited field of  view  and  lower  resolution.    Maintaining  spatial  orientation  at  night  requires  complex conscious  processing  of  data  from  various  instruments,  displays,  and  references.    The  task  of maintaining  spatial  orientation  competes  with  the  usual  tasking  of  navigation,  terrain  masking, threat avoidance, etc.  Add to this the fact that fatigue occurs more frequently at night and it is easy to understand why the incidence of spatial disorientation in this environment appears to be logarithmic as variables are added.  Constant vigilance and a good scan pattern, both inside and outside  the  cockpit,  must  be  maintained  to  help  prevent  spatial  disorientation.    Keeping  the horizon in the NVG scan can help avoid spatial disorientation.  If  you feel disoriented, react in exactly the same way  as if  you were on a non-NVG flight.   NOTE:  Refer to  AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1  Instrument Flight  Procedures, for a discussion on preventing aircraft mishaps due to spatial disorientation. 4.15.  Overconfidence  in  NVGs.  It  is  important  aircrew  not  become  over  confident  in  the capabilities of NVGs.  Goggles are only one tool used during night  flight,  and many situations can degrade or eliminate their effectiveness.  Aircrews need to be cognizant of NVG limitations and prepared to transition to other flight aids, primarily aircraft instrumentation.  Remember that NVGs  do  not  turn  night  into  day.    After  your  initial  NVG  flying  experience,  there  may  be  a natural  tendency  to  be  overly  confident  in  your  abilities.    While,  over  time,  there  will undoubtedly  be  an  increase  in  your  skill  level,  it  is  not  enough  to  compensate  for  the  multiple variables in the night environment.  The complacent mind-set could be a setup for a mishap.   56  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 Chapter 5 SD IN RPA AIRCREW 5.1.  Historical  Perspective:  Remotely  Piloted  Aircraft  (RPA).    What  is  now  known  as aviation  is  vastly  different  from  what  it  was  in  the  past.    Just  a  few  decades  ago,  in-flight refueling,  high  altitude  air  delivery,  and  stealth  technology,  were  at  the  forefront  of  advanced aviation.  However, the development and effectiveness of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) has driven  both  political  and  military  leadership  to  reconsider  national  defense  strategies,  aviation capability,  research  and  development  initiatives,  and  even  budgetary  allotments.    In  2010, Admiral  Michael  Mullen  stated,  “We're  at  a  real  time  of  transition  here  in  terms  of  future aviation.  What's going to be manned? What's going to be unmanned?  There are those who see [the JSF] as the last manned fighter/bomber.  And I'm one that's inclined to believe it—whether it's right or not.”23 5.1.1.  This new age of flying was forecast, maybe even prophesied, by General Henry “Hap” Arnold  when at  the end  of World War  II he stated,  “We have just won a war with  a lot of heroes  flying  around  in  planes.    The  next  war  may  be  fought  by  airplanes  with  no  men  in them  at  all…    Take  everything  you've  learned  about  aviation  in  war,  throw  it  out  of  the window, and let's go to  work on tomorrow's aviation; it will be different from  anything the world has ever seen”. 24  General Arnold’s assessment was correct; the world has never seen aviation the way that the unmanned community delivers it.  However, alongside this new and exciting  technology  are  new  and  unique  safety  challenges.    With  the  human  operator  no longer  on  the  flight  deck,  the  atmospheric,  physiological,  and  physical  limitations  are removed from the equation.  However, the operator is still integral to the system and creates significant human factors challenges. 5.2.  RPA  Human  Factors  Challenges.  A  study  by  Tvaryanas  and  Thompson  suggests  the validity  of  previous  human  factors  data  may  be  called  into  question  when  technology  changes rapidly  or  new  and  radical  designs  are  introduced,  as  with  the  advent  of  RPAs. 25     Tvaryanas also suggests that RPAs are the engineering control for traditional aeromedical physical hazards as  hypobaria,  hypoxia,  acceleration,  vibration,  thermal  stress,  and  those  forms  of  spatial disorientation  associated  with  acceleration. 26     However,  the  human  factor  is  forever  pertinent and ever-present.  Furthermore, the human operator is, and will continue to be the weak link in any operation, to include unmanned flight.  Additionally, spatial awareness, and a lack thereof, is directly  attributable to  other human  factor challenges, specifically loss of situational  awareness (LSA),  visual  illusions  and  disturbances,  mental  exhaustion  and  fatigue,  and  attention management.    Although  slightly  different  from  manned  aircrew,  RPA  aircrews  also  face orientation challenges.                                                  23 (www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=0203f6f8-a260-413a-96dc-5938367a2967) 24  (www.history.net) 25  (Tvaryanas and Thompson, n.d.) 26  (Tvaryanas, 2006) AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   57  5.3.  SD  and  RPA  Mishaps.  According to the FAA, “unmanned aircraft (UA) have suffered a disproportionately  large  number  of  mishaps  relative  to  manned  aircraft.” 27   In  1996,  the  Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (AFSAB) identified the human/system interface as the greatest deficiency in current UA designs.28  Yet, surprising to many, a relatively recent 10-year review of  Class  A  accident  statistics  for  military  MQ-1s  and  MQ-9s  show  that  the  mishap  rate  is normalizing when compared to that of the F-16 Fighting Falcon (see Figure 5.1.).  A disturbing data point was discovered during reports analysis; the human factors trends in MQ-1s and MQ-9s remained  the  same.    This  was  especially  true  as  it  pertained  to  spatial  disorientation  and  other misperception  factors.    Overall,  when  observing  ten  years  of  USAF  safety  data  the  U.S.  Air Force has lost an estimated 80 MQ-1s (see Figure 5.2).  Additionally, over a six-year period the USAF has lost an estimated 11 MQ-9s (see Figure 5.3).  As with most aircraft mishaps, there are typically two causes: a mechanical failure or human error; the latter falls into a category known as human factors.  One of the subcategories of human factors is the study of the visual system, and how aviators orient themselves, to include avoiding other aircraft.  The ability to avoid mid-air collisions  with  other aircraft is  an oft  discussed concern at  all levels  of aviation.   The FAA issued  this  statement  concerning  this  topic:  “Decisions  being  made  about  [RPA]  airworthiness and operational requirements must fully address safety implications of [RPA] flying in the same airspace  as  manned  aircraft,  and  perhaps  more  importantly,  aircraft  with  passengers.  Overcoming  these  [human  factor]  challenges  associated  with  the  differences  between  manned and unmanned aircraft while simultaneously transitioning to Next-Gen further amplifies the need for  extensive  cooperation  between  the  FAA,  other  government  agencies,  and  industry.” 29   As discussed in paragraph 1.2, Air Force Safety Center resources should be used for more recent mishap statistics.                                                  27  (Williams K, 2004) 28  (Worch et al, 1996) 29  (UAS Factsheet, 2011)   58  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 Figure 5.1.

Class A USAF MQ-9 Six-Year Look Back32.  5.3.1.  Spatial  disorientation  is  the  major  cause  in  32%  of  military  aviation  mishaps.    The United  States  Air  Force  loses  on  average  five  aircraft  each  year  due  to  spatial disorientation.33  This problem has been present since the first flight at Kitty Hawk and has been well researched with the manned paradigm in mind. 34 35 36 37  Therefore, the majority of spatial  orientation  research  suggests  that  pilots  receive  feedback  from  vestibular  and kinesthetic  receptors,  stimulated  by  angular  and  linear  accelerations,  which  are  phase advanced on the velocity and displacement of visual cues.  Yet, there is very little emphasis on  the  impact  of  operating  an  aircraft  solely  on  visual  cues  totally  devoid  of  traditional auditory, vestibular, or proprioceptive cues.  In 2012, the Air Force Safety Center published data  which  cited  human  factors  as  either  causal  or  contributory  in  100%  of  mishaps  in 2012.38   Of  those  factors,  some  type  of  spatial  disorientation  or  visual  misperception  was cited 74% of the time.  Additionally, RPA SD incidents are certainly higher than published due to the amount of near-misses that go unreported every year. 5.3.2.  SD  in  the  RPA  Community.  Spatial  disorientation  (SD)  has  long  been  associated with  inverted  flying,  the  leans,  centrifugal  forces,  and  other  physically-centric  scenarios.  However,  with  the  employment  of  highly  advanced  remotely  piloted  aircraft  (RPA)  it  is necessary  to  redefine,  or  at  least  research  spatial  orientation  challenges  as  they  pertain  to unmanned  flight.    For  various  reasons,  the  RPA’s  limited  see-and-avoid  capability  and  its absence  of  traditional  motion  and  sensitivity  cues  are  the  primary  threats  to  spatial                                                  32  (USAF Safety Center, 2012)  34  (deHavilland, 1913) 35  (Jones, 1917) 36  (O’Reilly and Mackechnie, 1920) 37  (Benson, 1973) 38  (Greenwood and Lee, 2011)   60  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 orientation.  Additionally, the see-and-avoid problem is not only relevant to spatial awareness as it pertains to the earth’s surface, but also to the location of other aircraft. 5.4.  RPA Spatial Orientation and Orientation Limitations. 5.4.1.  RPA  Orientation.  Aviators  orient  themselves  in  many  ways;  by  touch  or  feel, auditory  and  visual  cues,  and  by  the  inner  ear  which  responds  to  both  linear  and  angular acceleration.  It is also known, that of these orientation mechanisms, the visual system is the most  trustworthy.    Vision  is  by  far  the  most  important  sensory  input  to  spatial  orientation, especially so in moving vehicles such as aircraft.39 In current RPA platforms such as the MQ-1 and the MQ-9, crews are forced to orient themselves solely through the visual system.  This is akin to a non-motion flight simulator; only a real aircraft is being flown. Figure 5.4.  Examples of RPA Ground Control Station (GCS). Figure 5.5.  Examples of RPA Ground Control Station (GCS).   5.4.2.  Vision.  There are two visual orientation systems and they have two distinct functions: focal  vision for object  recognition  and ambient  vision for spatial  orientation.   Additionally, visual  and  vestibular  orientation  information  is  effectively  integrated  at  very  basic                                                  39  (DeHart and Davis, 2002) AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   61  (subconscious)  neural  levels.40   For  aviators,  this  integration  is  vital  to  spatial  orientation.  Regrettably, in most RPAs, the visual system is the single physiologic orientation mechanism available to RPA crews.  In retrospect, it would seem plausible that flying on visual cues only would  reduce  RPA  crews’  susceptibility  to  spatial  disorientation.    However,  none  of  these cues are designed to be used as a stand-alone orientation system. 5.4.3.  RPA  Orientation  Limitations.  By  removing  the  other  physiologic,  traditional, feeling-based  systems  from  the  equation,  RPA  pilots  may  not  experience  the  traditional spatial  disorientation  illusions.    However,  removing  these  factors  from  the  environment ironically creates a hyper-susceptibility to other orientation challenges.  One example of such a challenge is  a myriad of visual illusions due to the pilot’s inability to validate what he or she  perceives  to  be  true.    Furthermore,  even  though  the  visual  system  is  the  most  reliable sense of orientation, it is  severely limited in  flight.   Another orientation limitation  for RPA crews is information overload due to the high degree of RPA automation.  This overload is expected  with  the  advent  of  new  technology  however,  the  true  danger  rests  in  the  resultant attention management threats.  In current RPAs, much of the information provided to crews is written using engineer-logic rather than pilot-logic.  In other words, critical information is often buried behind keystrokes, M-keys, Variable Information Tables (VIT), figures of merit, and other engineering-centric software/hardware rather than dials, obvious gauges, and other pilot-centric  cockpit  sensors.    Furthermore,  the  lack  of  alternative  orientation  systems available  to  RPA  crews  places  higher  workloads  on  the  conscious-focal  system,  and  places no  demand  on  the  ambient-subconscious  system  (see  Figure  5.6).    Processing  information using  the  conscious-focal  system  often  leaves  crews  distracted  and  mentally  exhausted.  Research shows a positive correlation between mental exhaustion and task-performance.  In addition  to  the  aforementioned  challenges,  there  are  other  RPA-centric  challenges  to orientation which are discussed over the next few sections. Figure 5.6.  Cognitive Processing Diagram. 5.5.  Visual Challenges.  5.5.1.  Arx Tantum Visio (Only Focal Vision).  Due to the focal vision’s “what” function, it can  contribute  to  orientation  by  processing  information  from  judgments  of  constancy,                                                  40  (DeHart and Davis, 2002)   62  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 distances, shapes, sizes, depths,  and motion  parallax.  However, focal  vision only utilizes a narrow range because the retina loses resolution by an order of magnitude with just 15o off axis. 41    Focal  vision  is  not  designed  as  a  stand-alone  mechanism  for  environmental orientation; peripheral information is also very important.  In the manned community, black-hole  and  whiteout  conditions  are  types  of  scenarios  where  the  focal  system  is  forced  to operate  in  a  similar  manner.    RPA  aircrew  deal  with  these  factors  each  flight,  especially during the Launch and Recovery Element (LRE) phase.  Therefore, it can be said that RPA crews spend the majority of their flight time in black hole and/or whiteout conditions due to an absence of ambient cues. 5.5.2.  Judgment Difficulties.  Without the assistance of the ambient visual system, and the absence  of  peripheral  cues  to  help  provide  orientation  in  relation  to  the  earth,  RPA  crews often misperceive heights, distances, velocity, and depth perception. 5.5.2.1.  Depth  Perception  Challenges.  Depth  perception,  the  ability  of  the  brain  to determine  relative  distance  from  visual  cues,  is  compromised  by  any  atmospheric conditions  that  interfere  with  light  transmission.42   This  truth  is  even  more  compelling within  the  limited  visibility  parameters  of  most  RPAs.    Unlike  traditional  manned aviation  where  aviators  see  a  three  dimensional  picture,  RPAs  only  offer  a  two dimensional sight picture from what are basically television screens located in a Ground Control Station or GCS (see Figure 5.7).  The depth perception issue is best mitigated in manned  aircraft  by  relying  on  aircraft  instruments,  but  some  RPAs,  like  the  MQ-1,  are not  IMC  aircraft.    The  MQ-1  is  outfitted  with  a  pressure  altimeter  but  not  with  a  radar altimeter.  Additionally, the MQ-1 is equipped with a GPS Landing System (GLS) which creates an artificial Instrument Landing System (ILS).  However, according to T.O. 1Q-1(M)B-1,  “Localizer  and  Glide  Slope  on  the  GLS  are  calculated  from  the  GPS  data.  Erroneous GPS data could result in inaccurate localizer and/or glide slope indications.  A corrupted GLS data file could also result in erroneous indications.” 43  Consequently, the GLS is not fail-safe, nor is it certified for use in IMC conditions.   Unlike other manned aircraft, MQ-1 pilots cannot fully trust their instruments.  This fact is a major departure from  traditional  SD  awareness  literature.    Note:  The  MQ-9  is  outfitted  with  a  radar altimeter and also a weight on wheels switch.  These two engineering fixes have reduced the number of landing mishaps for MQ-9s.  However, the Reaper’s landing mishap rates are  still  significantly  higher  than  manned  platforms  because  of  the  inherent  visual problems  associated  with  RPA  flying.    RPA  type  and  capability  heavily  influence  the total  effect  of  reliance  on  visual  cues  only;  some  systems  can  be  landed  during  visual observation by the pilot or using auto-land systems. 5.5.2.1.1.  The  depth  perception  challenge  has  resulted  in  extremely  high  mishap numbers due to hard landings, nose first landings, and premature release of back stick pressure.    One  example  occurred  when  the  mishap  pilot  became  focused  on  GLS commands, resulting in a shallow approach.  Because of his limited depth perception resulting from a 45 degree field of view and no somatosensory cues, the mishap pilot failed  to  recognize  his  close  proximity  to  the  ground  and  did  not  make  appropriate                                                  41  (Previc and Ercoline, 2004) 42  (Reinhart, 1996) 43 T.O. 1Q-1(M)B-1(p.2-46) AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   63  control inputs to avoid landing short.  The lack of 3D visual cues and absence of other orientation  cues  creates  another  key  judgment  difficulty  as  it  pertains  to  depth perception  or  depth  sensation.    Other  than  using  all  available  orientation  cues,  one technique  RPA  crews  have  devised  is  to  use  the  current  pressure  altimeter  reading and compare it to the field elevation.  Subsequently, the sensor operator can verbalize 200 feet down to 50 feet calls during the landing phase. Figure 5.7.  MQ-1 GCS. 5.5.2.2.  Camera Variance/s.  Because RPA crews primarily use cameras for orientation and  awareness,  many  of  their  visual  perception  issues  begin  and  end  with  the  type  of camera that is installed on the aircraft.  5.5.2.2.1.  In  certain  instances,  one  level  of  technology  is  better  suited  than  others based  on  certain  environmental  and  electromagnetic  factors.    An  example  of  this  is that the MQ-9’s Multi-Spectral  Targeting System (MTS) Ball is  a moveable camera and  therefore  poses  a  vection  illusion  threat  should  it  rotate  upward  during  the landing  phase,  or  downward  during  the  departure  phase.    However,  it  is  also gyroscopically  engineered  and  offers  better  fidelity  than  the  other  two  cameras  (the nose camera and the IR nose camera).  Therefore, many pilots accept the illusion risk and land utilizing the MTS ball.  This topic is germane to the judgment discussion in that  the  three  cameras  offer  three  different  pictures.    This  is  mainly  due  their placement  on  the  aircraft  itself.    Example:  The  MQ-1/MQ-9  nose  camera  is physically higher on the aircraft and therefore presents a steeper gaze angle.  This can present  a  “too  high”  perception  resulting  in  a  nose  over  input,  increased  rate  of vertical velocity, and nose first landing or PIO.  Additionally, the MTS ball is lower on  the  aircraft  and  offers  a  shallower  gaze  angle  and  can  present  a  “too  low” perception resulting in the potential for longer and more exaggerated flare distances, or  overshoots  (See  Figure  5.8-5.9).    Note:  There  are  also  other  human  factors engineering  issues  that  exacerbate  this  phenomenon  such  as  flying  approaches  with nose  low  trim  set  and  then  failing  to  pull  the  stick  back  far  enough  to  compensate during the flare.   64  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 5.5.2.2.2.  Depending  on  RPA  type  and  mission  phase,  additional  sensors,  such  as  a digital  moving  map  display  or  digital  horizon,  may  provide  valuable  orientation information.  Also, visual sightings of the RPA can be used to ensure effective flight orientation. Figure 5.8.  MQ-1 Camera Variance Illustrations. Figure 5.9.  MQ-1 Camera Variance Illustrations.   5.5.2.3.  Field of View Limitations.  When the source of camera-fed pictures is obscured or  distorted  there  are  few  visual,  physical,  or  auditory  cues  by  which  RPA  pilots  can identify the ground, inhibiting their ability to orient themselves.  The normal field of view for the human visual system is 180° (140° for depth perception) yet the primary sensors for both MQ-1 and MQ-9 aircrews are the Multi-Spectral Targeting System (45° by 34°), an  Infrared  Nose  Camera  (36°  by  27°),  or  the  Nose  Camera  (30°  by  23°).    RPA  crew cannot effectively utilize the combination of focal and peripheral vision for simple tasks such as traffic deconfliction.  Furthermore, crews are limited to looking at one thing at a time  leaving  them  virtually  blind  to  both  insidious  and  sudden  peripheral  dangers  (See Figure 5.7). AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   65  Figure 5.10.  Examples of Soda Straw/Focal Vision with no ambient cues. Figure 5.11.  Examples of Soda Straw/Focal Vision with no ambient cues.   5.6.  Environmental  Factors.  Manned  pilots  view  the  environment  through  a  glass  canopy  or windshield,  while  RPA  crews  view  the  environment  through  sensors  and  the  lens  of  cameras.  Just as rain, clouds, debris, etc. obscure manned crews’ sight pictures, the same applies to RPA crews (See Figures 5.12-5.14).  The exception is that unmanned crews view these factors from an  outside-in  perspective,  rather  than  an  inside-out  perspective.    Therefore,  RPA  crews  are  not only limited by ophthalmic factors such as short and near sightedness, but they are also limited by  technology.    Engineering  weather  radars  and  panoramic  cameras  into  future  RPA  platforms will go a long way to preserve combat assets and prevent aircraft mishaps.   66  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 Figure 5.12.  MQ-1 Low Visibility Approach. Figure 5.13.  MQ-1 Low Visibility During Landing.   AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   67  Figure 5.14.  MQ-1 Night Landing (Black hole Example).  5.7.  Electromagnetic  Factors.  In  addition  to  environmental  factors  such  as  weather,  RPA crews  also  face  signal  strength  issues,  poor  picture  quality,  and  degradation  of  picture  due  to some  other  electromagnetic  limitations.    Video  cameras  and  television  screens  project  the environmental  factors  the  aircraft  is  experiencing;  therefore,  if  a  camera  feed  is  weak  or intermittent,  RPA  crews  are  not  receiving  the  most  accurate  visual  information  (See  Figure 5.15.).  The result is an unavoidable demand to make in some cases a life or death decision based on poor visual cues.  The same can be said based on the quality of the screen, or even the lighting in  the  GCS  itself.    These  types  of  issues  are  commonplace  amongst  RPA  crews.    When  these factors are encountered during a critical phase of flight, they have proven to be a key contributor to landing mishaps and incidents. Figure 5.15.  MQ-1 on Approach with a Poor Signal. 5.7.1.  For some RPA crews, the beginnings of an intermittent picture are akin to a manned crew unknowingly flying into some sort of weather phenomena which severely hinders their    68  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 visual picture.  One of their mitigation tactics is to send the aircraft lost link to accomplish its emergency  mission  until  a  positive  visual  picture,  control,  telemetry  data,  etc.  is  restored.  Other  frequent  issues  with  picture  can  be  a  choppy  picture,  a  frozen  picture,  or  video ghosting. 5.8.  RPA Specific Visual Illusions. 5.8.1.  Video  Ghosting.    Video  ghosting  can  occur  during  certain  scenarios  which  could present another aircraft’s video and telemetry to the pilot and crew.  More information on this phenomenon is detailed in a 2012 MQ-9 mishap. 5.8.2.  Vection  Illusion.  As  previously  mentioned  in  Chapter  3,  a  vection  illusion  is  a sensation of self-motion induced by relative movement  of viewed  objects.  Such sensations are frequently illusory, and can be of linear (translational) or angular (rotational) movement.  After  depth  perception  illusions,  Vection  Illusions  are  the  second  most  common  types  of illusions  encountered.    There  are  two  subsets  of  this  illusion  in  remote  aviation:  (1) Unintentional  and  (2)  Intentional  (Operator  Induced).    An  Unintentional  Vection  Illusion occurs when RPA crews fly off of the Multi-Targeting Spectral  System  or the “MTS ball”, and  the  ball  suddenly  moves.    An  Intentional  Vection  Illusion  occurs  when  an  input  by  an RPA crew member moves the ball while the pilot is using it as the primary visual source.  It should  be  noted  that  vection  illusions  are  not  a  primary  factor  when  RPA  crews  fly  off  of fixed cameras. 5.8.2.1.  Vection  During  Critical  Phases  of  Flight.  The  most  dangerous  scenario  is when the camera insidiously moves upward, perfectly mimicking an aircraft climb during a  critical  phase  of  flight.    This  insidious  movement  gives  the  pilot  a  nose-rising  visual cue.  The pilot’s reaction is to push the nose over sending the RPA into a Pilot Induced Oscillation (PIO).  To overcome this illusion, a pilot must be aware that when using the MTS  ball  as  a  primary  visual  flight  reference,  it  could  mechanically  fail  and  rotate upward  to  the  stow  position  due  to  a  Gimbal-Drive  Assembly  failure.    When  this  is experienced, the pilot must fight the urge to push the nose over.  This is a difficult task because the RPA pilot has no other cues to validate or reject the visual cues.  One factor that helps crews overcome this illusion is the speed in which the Gimbal-Drive assembly fails.    In  other  words,  a  more  sudden  and  quick  uncommanded  movement  can  help mitigate the illusion and cue the crew that the ball is moving and not the aircraft. 5.8.2.1.1.  On  Takeoff  Roll  and  Climb-out.  Uncommanded  MTS  movement  on takeoff  roll or climb-out can  cause pilots  and crews to  perceive that their attitude is abnormally  high  resulting  in  a  nose  over  input.    Aircrew  should  use  known  power settings  and/or  HUD  pitch  references  while  cross-checking  sensor  operator  video display for aircraft attitude to help counter vection illusions. 5.8.2.1.2.  On  Approach  and  Landing.  Uncommanded  MTS  movement  can  also occur  on  approach  and  landing,  resulting  in  pilots  and  crews  to  perceive  that  their attitude is abnormally high resulting in a nose over input.  Aircrew should use known power  settings  and/or  HUD  pitch  references  while  cross-checking  sensor  operator video display for aircraft attitude will help counter vection illusions. 5.8.2.2.  Intentional  (Operator  Induced).  An Intentional Vection Illusion occurs when an input by an RPA crew member moves the MTS ball while the pilot is using it as the AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   69  primary  visual  source.    This  will  be  seen  when  the  sensor  operator  is  tracking  targets, scanning  the  aircraft,  looking  for  weather,  etc.    This  movement  of  the  MTS  ball  is disorienting  and  requires  the  pilot  to  focus  on  the  HUD  graphics  (instruments)  thereby ignoring  the  visual  picture.    Communication  and  crew  coordination  are  the  keys  to preventing  intentional  vection  illusions.    As  previously  mentioned,  this  can  cause disorientation  and  confusion  for  unsuspecting  crewmembers.    This  is  especially  true during pattern work, or on departures and landings.  Good CRM and pre-briefed contract should  be  established  requesting  sensor  operators  to  notify  pilots  prior  to  moving  the MTS ball.  This can and should prepare the pilot for the sudden picture swings and sight adjustments. 5.9.  Cognitive Processing and Information Management Limitations. 5.9.1.  A human being’s limited ability to consciously process multiple levels of information simultaneously  challenges  RPA  crews  along  with  the  field-of-view  and  picture  challenges already  discussed.    As  previously  mentioned,  focal  vision  is  the  RPA  pilot’s  most  used orientation  tool  and  requires  constant  conscious  attention  which  after  time  can  cause  focal (visual) fatigue, focus trapping (a form of channelized attention tied to a single instrument or sensor),  and  even  empty  field  myopia,  when  lack  of  visual  stimulus  causes  loss  of  mental focus  on  the  task  at  hand.    It  is  important  to  follow  with  an  illustration  of  how  that information  is  used,  particularly  in  the  challenges  in  processing  several  inputs  effectively.  The  diagram  below  illustrates  how  the  human  operator  receives  information  and  how  that information results in either a correct, or incorrect motor response (see Figure 5.16). Figure 5.16.  Human Operator Sensory, Brain, and Motor System Diagram. 5.9.2.  Cognitive  Exhaustion.  Due  to  abnormally  high  reliance  on  focal-information,  RPA pilots  are  forced  to  maintain  approximately  6-8  hours  of  conscious  attention  in  order  to recognize aircraft output and aircraft orientation (spatial awareness).  This submission is also true of a shorter time period and a more intense workload.  Conscious attention is especially key  during  the  landing  and  departure  phases  of  flight.    Yet,  conscious  attention,  both  for  a    70  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 short or long period of time, requires a high mental workload and can mentally exhaust the operator. 5.9.2.1.  This type of exhaustion can lead to boredom, complacency, fatigue, and a high-susceptibility  to  visual  misperception  resulting  in  a  myriad  of  safety  of  flight  issues.  Subsequently,  once  fatigued,  cognitive  processing  speeds  become  slower.    This  is especially  true  after  high-density  workloads  over  an  extended  period  (3-4  hours)  when primarily  using  focal  vision.    Subsequently,  RPA  pilots  will  inevitably  revert  to subconscious  processing.    Once  an  individual  settles  on  the  subconscious  processor, decisions  become  automatic  without  the  utilization  of  risk  assessment,  forecasting, prioritization, and mitigation strategies (see Figure 5.17). Figure 5.17.  Situational- Decision Making Diagram. 5.10.  Attention  Anomalies.  As previously discussed, the subconscious  processor will by-pass any  risk  evaluation  altogether  and  rely  solely  on  memory  and  experience  as  the  blueprint  for performance.    This  is  a  dangerous  methodology  and  leads  to  boredom  proneness  and  other attention  anomalies  that  can  lead  to  a  loss  of  spatial  awareness  and  potentially  disorientation.  The common RPA attention threats are:  5.10.1.  Complacency.  The complacency risk is ever-present in the RPA community due to a Groundhog  Day  phenomena,  shift  work,  and  being  physically  separated  from  the  actual aircraft.    Complacency  has  led  to  a  plethora  of  mishaps  and  is  evident  by  incomplete  or incorrectly completed checklists, a lack of procedural knowledge, and poor responses to in-flight emergencies and other in-flight incidents. 5.10.2.  Boredom.  Oftentimes RPA crews find certain tasks such as constant reconnaissance or pattern of life missions to be boring.  A recent studyfound that task boredom (or boredom proneness)  was  most  present  at  the  4-6  hour  point  of  the  sortie  for  RPA  crews.  44   Additionally, it was found that sensor operators became bored more quickly than pilots. 5.10.3.  Task Saturation.  Task saturation is seen when individuals have too much to attend to at one time, thus possibly missing important cues or higher priority tasks.  This is especially true of RPA crews who frequently go from extreme boredom, to extreme excitement due to a                                                  44  (Tvaryanas, 2006) AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   71  sudden  mission  change.    For  example,  an  RPA  crew  will  often  sit  for  hours  at  a  time  with little  to  no  mental  arousal;  however,  just  before  shift  change  an  order  to  go  kinetic  will  be given.    The  sudden  change  can  overwhelm  RPA  crews  with  information.    Other  factors contributing  to  task  saturation  are  stress  (internal/external),  a  lack  of  proficiency  and/or currency (knowledge), and poor task management skills. 5.10.4.  Excessive  Professional  Deference.    In  the  case  of  excessive  professional  deference, junior or less qualified crewmembers are hesitant to call attention to deficient performance in others,  particularly  if  they  are  senior.    Therefore,  even  when  one  crewmember  points  out performance  which  is  outside  of  established  parameters,  it  is  typically  done  with  vague corrective instructions. 5.10.5.  Passenger Syndrome.  Lack of assertiveness is an issue in most multi-place aircraft.  However, in RPAs it can be more evident because most sensor operators are brand new to the Air Force or cross-train from other non-aviation career fields.  The issue is compounded by the fact that the career field is relatively new with very little history or precedent.  It is widely believed  that  this  issue  will  be  a  challenge  until  the  community  matures  and  the  overall experience  level  of  the  community  increases.    There  are  many  Class  A  mishaps  where  the sensor operator could have prevented the accident but failed to speak up after perceiving that his or her pilot had it “under control.” 5.10.6.  Loss  of  Situational  Awareness.    Situational  Awareness  (SA)  can  be  defined  as  the perception  of  the  elements  in  the  environment  within  a  volume  of  time  and  space,  the comprehension  of  their  meaning  and  the  projection  of  their  status  in  the  near  future.  However, SA is often dependent on the amount of available continuous information available to the individual.  For RPA crews, this information is saturated at the focal-conscious level and  requires  conscious  attention.    Additionally,  the  lack  of  subconscious,  vestibular,  and other lower level cues exacerbates the human inability to manage multiple scenarios for too long.    This  makes  RPA  crews  vulnerable  to  a  loss  of  SA  and  inevitably  a  loss  of  spatial orientation. 5.11.  Training  Issues.  USAF  aviation  training  must  include  preparation  for  all  aircraft operations, manned and unmanned.  It must begin with introducing new thoughts on SD beyond inner-ear  fluid,  otolith  organs,  and  cilia  to  include  concepts  like  cognitive  processing,  focally driven  awareness,  and  other  visually  induced  illusions.    In  an  effort  to  prevent  accidents, incidents, and even loss of life, more research must be conducted.  Until then, every effort must be  made  to  educate  RPA  crews  on  orientation  limitations,  resultant  illusions,  and  mitigation tactics.  Current RPA centric courses (activities) which include SD awareness for RPAs are AFI 11-403  Aerospace  Physiology  curriculum/training,  RPA-Instrument  Refresher  Course,  flight safety  meetings  and  councils,  Standardization/Evaluation  Review  Boards  (SERBs),  shop  visits, AFSAS data extraction, trending, and reporting of RPA mishaps. 5.12.  SD  Impact.  SD  is  an  erroneous  percept  of  any  of  the  parameters  displayed  by  aircraft control and performance flight instruments.  As more cameras, sensors, radars, etc. are added to these  aircraft  there  are  greater  chances  of  disorientation  episodes,  not  only  from  a  visual perspective but from a cognitive one as well.  In most accidents, there are several opportunities to prevent the mishap from occurring.   72  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 Chapter 6 SD CASE STUDIES  6.1.  Case studies illustrate aircrew susceptibility to SD because they demonstrate that SD can  happen  to  any  aviator  at  any  time.  Aircrews  should  review  risk  factors  and  maintain awareness via regular SD briefs during recurrent safety meetings, in addition to required training events. 6.2.  Case Study 1 – Fighter Aircraft.  The following mishap occurred just a few years ago and highlights many aspects  presented in this chapter on SD, such as any pilot being susceptible to SD, interplay between visual and vestibular systems, impoverished visual conditions, and NVG limitations.    An  F-16  pilot  with  over  2,600  total  flying  hours  maneuvering  at  night  wearing NVGs  became  spatially  disoriented  but  safely  ejected  from  his  aircraft.    The  $20M  aircraft however, impacted the water 120+ miles off the coast and was destroyed.  The pilot at the time was executing a hard, 90-degree left turn and began to descend, but he lost sight of the horizon and  became  disoriented.    The  Accident  Investigation  Board  (AIB)  concluded  that  the  cause  of the mishap was:  “The pilot’s failure to recognize and recover from SD in a timely manner due to inadequate instrument cross check.  Additionally, sufficient evidence indicates that the nighttime over-water environment, use of NVGs [night vision goggles], and weather conditions limited the visible  horizon,  substantially  contributing  to  the  mishap.”    Furthermore,  the  AIB  detailed  ten contributing factors to the mishap: 6.2.1.  Complacency.  The visible horizon to the northeast may have created a false sense of security or comfort to the pilot as he maneuvered at night while wearing night vision goggles. 6.2.2.  Restricted vision.  When flying at  night,  the pilot  became spatially  disoriented when he maneuvered to the west, the darker section of the night’s skyline.  Also, a cloud deck was at 6,000 ft [1.8 km] and may have presented a false horizon. 6.2.3.  Breakdown in visual scan.  The pilot failed to execute practiced internal and external crosschecks during maneuvers. 6.2.4.  Vestibular Illusion.  During the execution of a 18-second 65-degree nose low turn, any head movement can induce a vestibular illusion. 6.2.5.  Instrument  and  Sensory  feedback  systems.    The  night  vision  goggles  limited  the pilot’s  field  of  view  and  resolution;  the  attitude  indicator  may  have  provided  inadequate situational awareness due to technical limitations. 6.2.6.  Habituation:    during  daylight  hours  an  abeam  maneuver  is  performed  at  60  degrees nose low and may have led to the pilot performing the maneuver at night at nearly the same attitude. 6.2.7.  Elevator  Illusion:    this  illusion  occurs  when  a  reduction  in  descent  is  perceived  as  a climb;  thus  the  pilot  believes  that  he  has  arrested  and  reversed  the  aircraft’s  vertical movement when in fact it is still descending, just at a lesser rate.  It was during this descent that the pilot’s unrecognized SD was recognized and a recovery was attempted. AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   73  6.2.8.  Misinterpreted Instruments.  Correct information was displayed to the pilot but it was not  interpreted as such.  The pilot  failed to  differentiate the attitude displays of  ground and sky due to the extreme nose-low attitude. 6.2.9.  Gillingham  Illusion.    Pilots  with  restricted  visual  references  try  to  recover  from excessive  roll  maneuvers  by  inadvertently  inducing  more  roll  while  perceiving  a  constant bank  angle.    Although  the  pilot  recognized  his  SD  condition,  due  to  the  lack  of  visual references  available  (dark  westerly  direction  of  the  night’s  sky),  the  board  determined disorientation became incapacitating at this time. 6.2.10.  Temporal Distortion.  The pilot recalled detailed events within the entire scenario as he attempted to recognize and recover from his disorientation.  The pilot initiated an 8.75 G pull to recover.  However, he was inverted and the pull only worsened his position.  The pilot ejected 3 seconds prior to the aircraft hitting the water. 6.3.  Case Study #2 – Heavy Aircraft.  A C-130E pilot/co-pilot with a combined 1271 hours of C-130 total flying time along with a competent aircrew failed to recognize their landing picture due to a fog bank, with  reference to the runway, and to transition to a normal visual glide path for landing.  The three prior sorties were accomplished without incident between Al Salem AB, Kuwait City  International  (KCIA) and Al Jaber AB.  There were no reported aircraft problems and fatigue was ruled out.  The mishap aircraft’s final sortie departed with 86 passengers and 6 crewmembers from KCIA and was bound for Al Jaber AB.  Approximately 4.5 miles (2 minutes) from the approach end of the runway; the pilot/crew initiated a visual approach and began with a 3-degree  glide  slope,  at  about  640-fpm  rate  of  descent.    It  was  soon  transitioned  to  a  6  to  7 degree glide slope with a 1600-1700 fpm rate of descent for the remainder of the approach.  At about 125 feet AGL, descending at 28 feet per second, the aircraft entered a fog bank. The flight engineer  called  “Go  Around”  one  to  two  seconds  after  entering  the  fog  bank  (70  to  100  feet AGL).  The pilot complied and initiated the go-around procedure (full power and nose up) about a second after the flight engineer’s call.  The aircraft was too low (approximately 50 feet AGL) to break its descent rate and start a climb.  As a result, it impacted the ground 2890 feet short of the  runway  threshold  causing  three  fatalities,  seven  injuries  (two  serious)  and  damages  worth approximately  $3.8  million.    The  Accident  Investigation  Board  (AIB)  concluded  that  cause  of the  mishap  was,  “Crew’s  failure  to  follow  governing  directives  and  complacency  in  flight operations.    As  a  result,  the  crew  suffered  spatial  disorientation  at  a  critical  phase  of  flight; thereby, resulting in the crew’s loss of situational awareness  and failing to recognize an unsafe descent.”  Furthermore, the AIB detailed the following contributing factors to the mishap: 6.3.1.  Lack of pilot  leadership and discipline  –  In this case, the pilot  was an inexperienced brand new aircraft  commander with  51.7 hours  pilot-in-command experience  at  the time of the mishap.  According to the AIB, he failed to set the tone in the flight deck and allowed the crew to become complacent in their duties. 6.3.2.  Lack of support from the Co-pilot, Navigator and Flight Engineer – it is apparent from the narrative that the crew became complacent  and lost situational awareness.  The co-pilot made  all  their  radio  calls  but  failed  to  recognize  the  steep  approach  and  perceived  the approach  to  be  3-degree  glide  slope.    The  navigator  was  scanning  the  outside  environment for other aircraft and failed to do cross-checks or provide information on recommended glide path, wind drift, distances and clearances.  The flight engineer was also scanning the outside   74  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 environment  and  noticed  the  bank  but  failed  to  inform  the  crew  because  he  felt  that  the aircraft would over fly the fog. 6.3.3.  Lack  of  sound  judgment  by  the  flight  deck  crew  –  The  crew  displayed  a  lack  of judgment  throughout  the  sortie  especially  during  crew  planning  phases  and  failed  to implement/adhere to Air Force and Department of Defense instructions.  The pilot deviated from AF directives when he did not wear his  glasses to fly.  The crew failed to contact the base  tower  to  check  weather  prior  to  beginning  the  descent.    The  crew  elected  to  fly  a published approach despite the weather required  for the approach being below the  required minimums.  Approximately five minutes after takeoff, the crew maneuvered the aircraft for the final approach by flying to a point northwest  of the field versus flying directly over the navigational aid.  This caused the crew to rush through the checklists and possibly put them behind.    As  a  result,  the  aircraft  was  too  high  and  too  close  to  the  runway  for  a  normal descent  profile.    The  pilots  also  failed  to  monitor  their  flight  instruments  during  night conditions on the approach. 6.3.4.  The above mentioned contributing factors created a chain of events that led to a loss of situational  awareness  by  the  aircrew  and  spatial  disorientation  for  the  pilot.    First,  certain preconditions such as a lack of ambient visual orientation cues due to minimal surrounding light sources around the runway and the fog bank already existed.  Second, the crew’s lack of communication,  complacency,  cross-check,  and  rush  to  complete  checklists  created  a dangerous  situation.    This  may  have  contributed  to  the  pilot’s  failure  to  recognize  his transition  point  to  the  normal  glide  scope  and  resulted  in  Type  I  (unrecognized)  spatial disorientation.  According to the DoD HFACS  guide  - Spatial  Disorientation is  a failure to correctly  sense  a  position,  motion  or  attitude  of  the  aircraft  or  of  oneself  within  the  fixed coordinate system provided by the surface of the earth and the gravitational vertical. Spatial Disorientation (Type 1) Unrecognized is a factor when a person’s cognitive awareness of one or more of the following varies from reality: attitude; position; velocity; direction of motion or acceleration.  Proper control inputs are not made because the need is unknown. 6.4.  Case Study #3 – RPA (MQ-1).  During initial climb-out after a touch and go, the Mishap Aircraft  (MA)  Multi-Spectral  Targeting  System  (MTS)  moved  from  Position  Mode  upward without  any  input  from  the  Mishap  Sensor  Operator  (MSO)  or  commands  from  Pilot/Sensor Operator  (PSO)  Control  Station  2.    The  Mishap  Student  Pilot  (MSP)  misidentified  the  upward movement of the MTS as an increase in the MA's pitch attitude and commanded approximately 10° nose down pitch.  The MSP failed to identify the uncommanded movement of the MTS as a malfunction and failed to crosscheck the nose camera displayed on the MSO's monitor, prior to commanding nose down pitch.  The nose gear impacted the runway at 2.68 G-force with the MA in  a  6°  nose-low  attitude  and  a  subsequent  nose-high  bounce  Pilot  Induced  Oscillation  (PIO).  During this time, the Mishap Evaluator Pilot (MEP) crosschecked the nose camera display on the MSO's  monitor  and  identified  the  bounce  and  PIO.    The  MEP  took  control  of  the  MA  PSO Control Station 1 control stick and commanded approximately 20° nose up pitch.  The MA nose gear  impacted  the  runway  a  second  time  with  the  MA  in  a  12°  nose-low  attitude.    The  MA bounced again reaching approximately 25° nose high causing the tail and propeller to strike the runway at 4.88 G-force.  The tail and propeller strike caused one of the propeller blades to depart the  MA's  propeller  assembly,  catastrophic  engine  damage,  and  engine  fire.  Following  the  tail strike, the MA oscillated between 10-20° nose-up with full power commanded for approximately eight  seconds.    The  MA  impacted  the  runway  a  third  and  final  time  with  12°  left  bank  and AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   75  approximately  a  zero  pitch  level  attitude.    The  final  impact  registered  the  maximum  reportable value  of  5.0  G-force.    With  the  nose  gear  and  both  main  landing  gear  collapsed,  the  MA  slid approximately  300  feet  coming  to  rest  along  the  asphalt  edge  and  dirt  on  the  south  side  of  the runway.  The MA stopped with the MTS resting on the nose gear strut and the engine on fire. 6.4.1.  MSP Human Factors Analysis: The MSP was relatively new to LR operations having just  successfully  completed  his  MQ1LR  evaluation  earlier  in  the  MS.    After  the  MEP  flew two patterns to a touch and go for his currency, the MSP returned to the controls to conduct additional approaches to increase proficiency.  During the climb-out phase of the touch and go, the uncommanded upward movement of the MTS caused the visual illusion that the MA was reaching an excessively nose high attitude.  The MSP's attention became channelized on this  unexpected  perceived  nose  high  condition.    The  visual  illusion  caused  spatial disorientation which was unrecognized by the MSP.  In response to the perceived nose high attitude,  the  MSP  commanded  approximately  10°  nose  down  pitch.    This  pitch  command resulted in a PIO, two nose gear impacts, and the tail and propeller strike on the runway.  The tail  and  propeller  strike  caused  the  propeller  to  depart  the  MA  propeller  assembly  and additional catastrophic  engine damage.   Conclusion:  The SIB determined the actions of the MSP were a causal factor in this mishap. 6.4.2.  MEP  Human  Factors  Analysis:  After  recognizing  the  uncommanded  upward movement of the MTS, the MEP crosschecked the nose camera on the MSO's monitor.  The MEP  recognized  the  MA  was  beginning  to  pitch  down  and  directed  the  MSP  to  command "nose up."  The MSP had to process the directed "nose up" command and determine if that meant  the  MA's  nose  was  pitching  up  or  that  the  MEP  wanted  him  to  command  the  MA's nose  up.    Use  of  the  standard  "go-around"  call  by  the  MEP  may  have  conveyed  a  clearer message  to  the  MSP  and  allowed  him  to  immediately  rely  on  previous  training  and experience to command aft stick with full power.  If the MSP commanded aft stick earlier in the  sequence,  the  amount  of  damage  resulting  from  the  second  nose  gear  impact  may  have been reduced.  The MEP took appropriate action by taking control of the stick to command nose-up pitch.  Conclusion: The SIB concluded the actions of the MEP were not a factor in this mishap, but could contribute to future mishaps. 6.4.3.  Technical  Order  (T.O.)  Publications:  The  SIB  also  determined  two  WARNINGs  for "possible  uncommanded  MTS  movement  while  in  Position  Mode"  should  be  added  to  the Takeoff  procedures  (page  2-31)  and  the  Before  Landing  checklist  (page  2-46)  in  T.O.  1Q-1(M)B-1.  This WARNING should be added following paragraph 5 of the Takeoff section:  While  conducting  takeoffs  using  the  MTS  cameras,  crews  must  be  aware  of  possible uncommanded  MTS  movement  while  in  Position  Mode.  In  the  event  of  uncommanded  MTS movement during takeoff roll, consider initiating an "ABORT". If continuing the takeoff, use HUD  pitch  references  while  crosschecking  Sensor  Operator  video  display  for  aircraft attitude.  This WARNING should be added to Step 4 of the Before Landing checklist:  While conducting  approaches  and  landings  on  MTS  cameras,  crews  must  be  aware  of  possible uncommanded  MTS  movement  while  in  Position  Mode.  In  the  event  of  uncommanded  MTS movement during landing, consider initiating a "GO-AROUND" using HUD pitch references while  crosschecking  Sensor  Operator  video  display  for  aircraft  attitude.  Conclusion:  The SIB  concluded  T.O.  Publications  were  not  a  factor  in  this  mishap,  but  could  contribute  to future  mishaps.  Note:  These  recommendations  were  non-concurred  at  the  MAJCOM  level due to feeling that this was a “basic airmanship issue”. This exact incident has happened five   76  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 additional  times  since,  and  is  further  proof  of  how  difficult  it  is  to  implement  HF  RPA mitigation  tactics.    It  is  well  known  that  due  to  the  RPA’s  relative  newness,  much  of  the USAF is unaware of the degree of difficulty associated with operating an aircraft without the use of traditional motion and sensitivity cues.  For now, RPA crews should be aware of this recommendation as a “technique only” until effectively implemented into the T.O.s. 6.4.4.  The  Multi-Spectral  Targeting  System  (MTS):  Position  Mode  is  described  as  follows by paragraph 4.2.6.3 of T.O. 1Q-1(M)B-1: "Selecting position mode places the turret at 0° azimuth and 0° elevation, or forward caged position, relative to the aircraft longitudinal axis.  While in position mode, the turret will respond to input commands from the control stick in azimuth (±180°) and elevation ( 60° to -105°), but will return to the caged position when the control  stick  is  returned  to  the  neutral  position.    When  position  mode  is  selected  the AN/AAS-52  HUD  graphics  display  POS  in  the  gimbals’  status  line.    The  select  position mode  via  the  HUD  toolbar,  select  the  POS  button."    The  MA's  MTS  moved  upward  from Position Mode without any inputs from the MSO or commands from PSO2. In addition, no associated  GIM  DIS  errors  were  displayed.    The  MTS  manufacturer  and  maintenance  have identified  that  this  movement  may  have  been  associated  with  a  "non-coded"  GIM  DIS equipment  safety  function  IAW  T.O.  1Q-1(M)B-1  paragraph  4.3.2:  "Occasionally conditions  may  exist  (mechanical,  electrical,  etc.)  which  cause  the  turret  gimbals  to  lock.  This is a built-in safety feature designed to prevent damage to the gimbal drive motors."  The SIB conducted an informal survey of MQ-1B and MQ-9A Mission Control Element (MCE) and  LRE  aircrew  members  to  determine  if  uncommanded  movement  of  the  MTS  while  in Position Mode had been observed in all phases of flight. 47 of 141 survey participants (33%) indicated they had observed uncommanded movement of the MTS while in Position Mode.  Conclusion:  The  SIB  determined  the  uncommanded  movement  of  the  MTS  was  a  causal factor in this mishap.  Summary: This mishap is a prime example of RPA SD.  The impact of SD in RPA operations is an ever growing, but widely unknown threat.  While the vestibular aspects of SD are expectedly absent, the visual factors are present and are a safety of flight issue. AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   77  Chapter 7 RECOGNITION AND PREVENTION OF SD MISHAPS 7.1.  The  pilot’s  role  in  preventing  mishaps  due  to  SD  essentially  involves  three things:  training,  good  flight  planning,  and  knowledge  of  procedures.    The  key  to  success  in instrument flying is an efficient instrument crosscheck.  The flight instruments provide the only reliable  aircraft  orientation  information,  at  night  or  in  IMC.    Any  situation  or  factor  that interferes  with  this  flow  of  information,  directly  or  indirectly,  increases  the  potential  for disorientation. 7.2.  Training.  The training and education of the pilot  about the dangers of SD begin  with  the information in this chapter.  Additional information is provided by flight surgeons, aerospace and operational  physiologists,  IRC  instructors,  and  flying  safety  officers  through  lectures,  slide presentations,  films,  videos,  and  safety  journals.    Experienced  pilots  can  pass  on  valuable information  to  new  crewmembers  in  flight  briefings  and  squadron  meetings.    Finally,  training can ensure pilots recognize SD-inducing situations and make risk assessment decisions related to maintain their orientation and situational awareness. 7.2.1.  Basic Knowledge.  The effects of SD can be minimized through an understanding of the  physiological  mechanisms  that  cause  various  illusions,  the  phases  of  flight  where  the illusions can be expected, and a plan of action (procedure) to follow in dealing with sensory conflicts once they occur. 7.2.2.  Flight  Simulators  and  Trainers  to  Prevent  SD.    Aircraft  simulators  are  excellent training  devices  for  learning  instrument  flight  procedures.    A  pilot  who  experiences demanding  situations  during  impoverished  visual  conditions  creates  a  knowledge  base  for maintaining awareness and orientation.  Also, simulators can provide pilots with recognition of cues that may enhance risk assessment processes regarding scenarios that may lead to SD.  Thus,  simulators  enhance  instrument  flight  procedures  and  scanning  techniques  during cognitively demanding tasks. 7.2.3.  Aircraft Flight.  Regular and frequent instrument flight in the aircraft either under the hood (if available), at night, or in actual weather conditions is necessary to provide the pilot the experience and confidence needed to fly safely in instrument conditions. 7.3.  Flight Planning.  Thorough preflight planning is important in reducing the potential for SD incidents,  particularly  in  fighter-type  aircraft.    It  is  difficult  for  a  pilot  to  fly  the  airplane  and maintain  an  effective  instrument  crosscheck  while  searching  for  information  in  the  IFR supplement. 7.3.1.  General  information.    Before  takeoff  acquire  all  of  the  information  needed  to  safely complete  an  instrument  flight.    This  is  particularly  important  for  cross-country  flights  to strange  fields  in  night  weather  conditions.    The  remarks  section  of  the  IFR  Supplement Airport/Facility  Directory  and  FLIP  AP/l  should  be  checked  for  known  approach  illusions.  Attention should be directed during flight planning to events that may be unexpected.  What are the missed approach procedures?  What is the circling minimum descent altitude?  What type of runway lighting system is installed at the alternate airfield?   78  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 7.3.2.  Specific situation.  If available at the base of intended landing, pilots flying single-seat aircraft  should  plan  to  make  a  single  frequency,  en  route  descent  to  a  radar  monitored, precision approach during night or IMC. 7.3.3.  Risk  Management.    In  line  with  flight  planning  is  the  knowledge  of  the  type  of mission  to  be  flown,  the  conditions  encountered,  the  weather  forecast,  illumination,  and threat  level  combined  with  the  knowledge  of  the  pilots’  currency  and  proficiency  for  that particular mission and the individual pilot’s assessment of their skill-level for that day/night.  All of these factors play a role with how susceptible a pilot may be for an SD episode on one day  compared  to  another  day.    Training  and  experience  may  help  a  pilot  recognize environmental cues and resulting scenarios that may lead to problems (SD and/or successful mission accomplishment).  Risk assessment involves amending activities and taking action to reduce  risk  by  removing  or  eliminating  hazards.    For  example,  a  night  NVG  flight  in mountainous  terrain  ought  to  have  extensive  risk  assessment  applied  prior  to  takeoff  to ensure success. 7.4.  Procedures.  It  is  important  that  aviators  have  an  established  set  of  recommended procedures to follow in the event they experience spatial disorientation.  The general procedures put forth here may differ depending on type of aircraft (such as single-seat, dual-seat, or crew-type  aircraft)  or  type  of  mission  (formation  flight  or  NVG  flight).    Additionally,  commands normally establish specific procedures for aircraft under their control. 7.4.1.  General Principles.  Any pilot who does not continually monitor the flight instruments during  IMC,  night,  and  other  conditions  of  reduced  visibility  has  a  significantly  increased risk  of  developing  SD,  perhaps  in  a  matter  of  seconds.    This  disorientation  could  occur  in several ways.  The pilot may divert attention from the instruments just long enough to study an  approach  plate,  look  for  a  wingman,  or  assess  the  effect  of  a  weapons  drop,  and  feel perfectly comfortable as he/she develops Type I disorientation.  The pilot may fly the aircraft into  the  ground  without  realizing  the  error  or  check  the  instruments  and  regain  orientation, but too late to prevent a mishap.  Alternatively the pilot may develop Type II disorientation and  struggle  with  a  sensory  conflict  to  maintain  control  of  the  aircraft.    The  general procedure  for  dealing  with  SD  is  the  same  for  all  aircraft.    Start  with  the  basics:  Aviate, Navigate,  and Communicate.   This  mantra, learned from  Day-1 in  pilot  training, prioritizes flying  the  airplane  (altitude,  airspeed,  and  heading)  as  the  most  important  task.    Similar  to recovering  from  an  unusual  attitude,  “aviate”  would  include  to  Recognize,  Confirm,  and Recover.    Often  a  pilot  may  not  recognize  their  own  SD,  increasing  the  need  to  prevent  it from  ever developing.   The following paragraphs further expand upon the steps  to  prevent, mitigate, and/or recover from SD. 7.4.2.  Recognize Problem.  If a pilot begins to feel disoriented, the key is to recognize and confirm the problem early.  Then take immediate corrective actions before aircraft control is compromised. 7.4.3.  Reestablish Visual Dominance.  The pilot must reestablish accurate visual dominance.  To do this, keep the head in  the cockpit, defer  all cockpit chores that are not  essential, and concentrate  solely  on  flying  basic  instruments.    Keeping  the  head  in  the  cockpit  means  to focus on the instruments  and not  to  look  outside.  The  external  visual environment may be the  cause  of  SD,  and  flying  via  instruments  will  most  quickly  establish  proper  orientation.  Make  frequent  reference  to  the  attitude  display  that  is  the  primary  reference  needed  to AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   79  establish  and  maintain  visual  dominance.    Apply  the  necessary  control  inputs  to  make  the attitude  indicator  display  the  desired  orientation  and  adjust  that  display  to  make  the  other flight parameters fall into line. 7.4.4.  Beware of Persistent Symptoms.  If the symptoms do not improve immediately, or if they get worse, the pilot should bring the aircraft to straight and level flight using the attitude display.  Maintain straight-and-level flight until the symptoms abate.  Declare an emergency if necessary, and advise ATC of the problem. 7.4.5.  Resolve  Sensory  Conflict.    If  action  is  not  taken  early,  the  pilot  may  not  be  able  to resolve the sensory conflict.  It is possible for SD to proceed to a point (a true state of panic) where the pilot is unable to see, interpret, or process information from the flight instruments.  Further, it may not be possible to hear or respond to verbal instructions.  Aircraft control in such a situation may be impossible.  The pilot must admit that physiological limits have been exceeded and the only alternative may be to abandon the aircraft. 7.4.6.  Transfer  Aircraft  Control.    If  the  pilot  experiences  SD  to  a  degree  that  it  interferes with  maintaining  aircraft  control,  then  control  of  the  aircraft  should  be  transferred  to  the second crewmember, if qualified.  If an autopilot is available, consideration should be given to using it to control the aircraft. 7.4.6.1.  Single-Seat/Solo  Aircraft.    A  pilot  alone  in  an  aircraft  is  more  limited  in applying these general principles to deal with spatial disorientation.  In this situation, the pilot obviously does not have the option to transfer aircraft control, except possibly to the autopilot. 7.4.6.2.  Dual-Seat  Aircraft.    The  same  general  principles  stated  above  apply  to  a  dual-seat aircraft.  However, a second crewmember is generally available to share the cockpit workload. 7.4.6.2.1.  Division  of  Workload.    The  other  crewmember  can  assist  the  pilot  by copying  clearances,  changing  radio/IFF  channels,  and  acquiring  information  from flight information publications.  The division of workload between the crewmembers should be clearly understood and covered in the preflight briefing. 7.4.6.2.2.  Critical  Phases.    During  departures,  penetrations/en  route  descents,  or critical phases of flight, the second crewmember should closely monitor and call out altimeter settings, altitudes, airspeeds, and other appropriate information. 7.4.6.3.  Crew  Aircraft.    The  same  general  principles  apply  to  crew-type  aircraft.  Although  additional  crewmembers  are  available  to  reduce  pilot  workload,  illusions  and sensory conflicts are possible and do occur.  Illusions experienced here are more likely to be visual in origin than vestibular.  Specific procedures concerning division of workload and crew coordination should be clearly understood and covered in the preflight briefing. 7.4.7.  Flying  Formation.    All  of  the  general  principles  for  dealing  with  SD  apply  to formation flights.  Additional procedures are necessary since the potential for SD is  greatest for formation flights during night or weather conditions. 7.4.7.1.  Proficiency.    Pilots  scheduled  for  formation  flights  in  night/IMC  should  be current  and  proficient  in  instrument,  night,  and  formation  flying.    Particular  attention should  be  directed  to  the  number  of  sorties  and  flying  hours  in  the  past  30  days.    80  AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015 Remember, all pilots are susceptible to SD regardless of total experience and pilots in a new airframe are especially susceptible as they learn the new mission and aircraft. 7.4.7.2.  Safe Formation Flight.  There are two essential requirements for safe formation flight.  First, the flight leader must be experienced, competent, and smooth.  Second, the wingman  must  be  proficient  in  formation  flying.    The  wingman  must  have  total confidence in lead and concentrate primarily on maintaining a proper wing position. 7.4.7.3.  Night  Join-ups.    Night  join-ups  are  inherently  difficult,  particularly  when conducted at low altitude over water or dark terrain.  Alternative profiles, such as a trail departure and climb-out, should be considered. 7.4.7.4.  Deteriorating Weather.    If the weather encountered during a  formation  flight  is either  too  dense  or  turbulent  to  ensure  safe  flight,  the  flight  leader  should  separate  the aircraft under controlled conditions.  This may be better than having a wingman initiate lost  wingman  procedures  at  a  time  that  may  be  dangerous  or,  worse  yet,  when  the wingman is severely disoriented. 7.4.7.5.  Disoriented  Wingman.    In  the  preflight  briefing,  the  flight  leader  should  cover specific procedures to manage a disoriented wingman.  NOTE: Lost wingman procedures are designed to ensure safe separation between aircraft in a flight when a wingman loses sight  of  lead.    Lost  wingman  procedures  are  not  designed  to  recover  a  wingman  with severe  spatial  disorientation.    Precise  execution  is  required  to  perform  lost  wingman procedures; a severely disoriented pilot may not be able to accomplish this. 7.4.7.6.  Communication.    The  flight  lead  should  encourage  a  wingman  to  verbalize  a feeling  of  disorientation.    A  few  words  from  lead  may  reassure  the  wingman  and  may help form a mental picture of the flight’s position in space.  For example: “Two, we are level at 20,000 feet in a 30 degree left bank at 300 knots.” 7.4.7.7.  Wingman with  Persistent  SD.   If the wingman continues to  have problems, the lead  should  bring  the  flight  to  straight-and-level  and  advise  the  wingman.    If  possible, maintain straight-and-level for at least 30 seconds and up to 60 seconds.  Generally, the wingman’s  symptoms  will  subside  in  30  to  60  seconds.    Advise  ATC  if  an  amended clearance is necessary. 7.4.7.8.  Lead  Transfer.    If  the  above  procedures  are  not  effective,  then  lead  should consider  transferring  the  flight  lead  position  to  the  wingman  while  straight-and-level.  NOTE:  Once  assuming  lead,  maintain  straight-and-level  flight  for  60  seconds  before initiating  turns,  climbs,  or  descents.    The  objective  is  for  the  disoriented  pilot  to reestablish visual dominance as quickly as possible.  Again,  a  wingman  that is  severely disoriented should normally not elect or be directed to execute lost wingman procedures.  At this point, consideration should be given to terminating the mission and recovering the flight by the simplest and safest means possible.  Under exceptional circumstances, such as if the above procedures are ineffective and the disoriented wingman cannot continue to fly  formation  safely,  the  lost  wingman  procedure  and  single  ship  recovery  are  a  viable last resort. 7.4.7.9.  Lost  Wingman.    SD  may  not  be  experienced  until  the  pilot  executes  lost wingman  procedures.    Sudden  vestibular  and  other  erroneous  sensory  inputs  may  not agree  with  instrument  indications.    It  is  most  important  at  that  moment  for  the  pilot  to AFPAM11-417  9 APRIL 2015   81  believe and trust the attitude display and to make the attitude display reflect the desired aircraft  orientation.    It  is  paramount  that  a  pilot  who  has  just  gone  lost  wingman immediately advise flight lead if he/she is experiencing any effects of SD.  The flight lead should  advise  current  flight  parameters,  ensure  that  flight  member  has  transitioned  to instruments, and clear an altitude block if necessary.  For example, in 2011, an A-10 pilot flying  as  wing  on  a  2-ship  vector  in  the  weather  for  an  instrument  approach  went  lost wingman and became spatially disoriented but safely ejected.  It is not unusual for SD to occur  after  intently  trying  to  fly  formation  for  an  extended  period  of  time  and  then quickly  being  thrust  into  flying  instruments.    The  SD  symptoms  should  subside  within 30-60 seconds with a concentrated effort on basic aircraft control with the attitude display as the primary reference.  TOD. D.
