This Qualification Training Package (QTP) was developed to enhance and standardize on-the-job  training  for  4P0X1  personnel.    As  a  trainer,  the  QTPs  provide  teachable elements of task breakdowns.  The teachable elements will assist in guiding the trainee towards independent task performance, proficiency, and serve as an evaluation tool for trainers/certifiers.  2.    Review  the  volume(s)  of  the  Career  Development  Course  (s)  (CDC)  and  identify which module(s) of the QTP is needed for the trainee’s job position or upgrade skill-level training.  The QTP training for each module should be accomplished in the order which most closely mirrors the area in which the trainee is working.  Items in column 2 of the Pharmacy Job Qualification Standard (JQS)/Specialty Training Standard  (STS) marked with a 5 or 7 are core tasks for the 4P career field.  Additional proficiency training may be required for these tasks at the supervisor’s discretion.   3.  Ensure the trainee reviews the training references in each module prior to attempting any  task  or  QTP  evaluation.    Review  the  performance  checklist  and  training  objective with  the  trainee.    If  the  trainee  has  questions  about  the  objective,  clarify  the  desired outcome/results of performance, demonstration or completion of the task.  Remember the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task independently.    4.  When the trainee has received sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on the objective, follow the evaluation instructions.  The performance checklist must be used as you  evaluate  each  task  objective.    When  the  trainee  successfully  demonstrates  and accomplishes the objective, document the task completion appropriately in the member’s Air Force Training Record (AFTR).  5.  The QTP task completion is to be annotated in the trainee’s electronic training record.  NOTE:  The individual checklists and final evaluations are not filed in each member’s user files.  6.    If  the  trainee  does  not  accomplish  the  objective,  review  the  areas  needing  further instruction.    Conduct  feedback  for  each  module  with  the  trainee,  and  document appropriately in the member’s Air Force Training Record.  As the trainer, once you are satisfied  the  trainee  is  ready  to  perform  the  task;  he/she  will  be  re-evaluated  until  the objective is met.  7.  If a task being trained requires third party certification by a task certifier/certifying official, the trainer ensures trainee is qualified to perform the task independently.  The trainee will then be evaluated by certifier/certifying official.  Tasks requiring certification are identified in column 2 of JQS with a number sign (#).  The certifier/certifying official will  ensure  documentation  in  column  3E  of  the  JQS.  The  certifier  will  ensure  that  a trainer’s signature is documented prior to signing off on the task in AFTR.   4 | P a g e  8.  Tasks associated with a QTP are identified in column 4D of the STS.  The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing task qualifications for upgrade training or job position training.  Such standardization benefits the JQS training concept throughout a member’s career.  These documents may also be used in assessing/certifying pharmacy technicians upon arrival at a new duty station.  9.    Feedback  is  a  vital  and  important  part  of  improving  our  educational  process  for pharmacy  technicians.    Your  first  hand  expertise  is  valued  and  feedback  highly encouraged  ensuring  we  have  the  most  up-to-date  information  and  training  possible.   Please direct all inquiries to:  your immediate supervisor.    5 | P a g e  SUBJECT AREA:  Home Station Medical Response Point of Dispensing  TASK NAME(S): Knowledge of procedures and ability to demonstrate:  Activation of the installations point of dispensing (POD), capabilities, location, team member roles and deactivation.   CFETP/STS REFERENCE(S):  2.1; 2.1.1; 2.1.2; 2.2; 2.2.1; 2.2.2; 2.3   EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:  1.  Disease Containment Plan specific to installation 2.  Strategic National Stockpile guidance 3.  Medical Contingency Response Plan Annex N 4.  Point of Dispensing/Team Members Checklists 5.   Instructions on how to make ADHOC labels 6.   POD Kits of non-medical supplies  TRAINING REFERENCE(S):    Medical Contingency Response Plan Annex N, AFPAM 10-100 Airmen’s Manual, AFI41-106 Medical Readiness Program Management, AFI 10-2604 Disease Containment Planning Guidance, Installations Mass Prophylaxis/Disease Containment Plans, 886E Allowance Standard, National Stockpile Information and Just-In-Time Training Material  REMARKS/NOTES:   Each Air Force installation has a written mass prophylaxis plan IAW AFI 41-106, Unit Level Management of Medical Readiness Programs.  The mass prophylaxis plan should be an annex within the installation’s disease containment plan (DCP).  Requirements for the DCP are contained within AFI 10-2604, Disease Containment Planning Guidance.   Within each Air Force installation’s DCP are established guidelines for mass treatment/prophylaxis POD for a chemical, biological, radiological and/or nuclear (CBRN) event or naturally occurring pandemic (e.g. Pandemic Influenza).  This capability is crucial to protecting the installation’s beneficiary population, preventing or reducing casualties, and effectively maintaining and/or restoring critical or essential operations.   1.1. The purpose of a POD is to provide the overall outpatient dispensing procedures for executing mass prophylaxis in response to one of several contingencies where medications or vaccines will need to be dispensed to a large number of people in a short period of time. 1.2. The DCP provides guidance to plan, activate and de-activate a mass prophylaxis POD site. Most military installations will operate as a CLOSED POD; responsible for those individuals affiliated with the base only.  1.3. The DCP provides the installation and medical treatment facility (MTF) with resources and checklists that are customized to the installations operations. This is a joint effort to include teams from medical command and control (MCC), nursing/clinical, security, manpower, patient administration, logistics, systems, and immunizations if needed.  1.4. The Allowance Standard 886E includes support for up to 300 CBRN casualties and 150 first responders.  Reference the AFI 10-2603: Emergency Health Powers On Air Force Installations specific to 5. 1.2 1.5. It is important to understand the role of the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and the protocols for requesting SNS assets.  Every Air Force installation should have a  6 | P a g e  memorandum of agreement or understanding (MOA/MOU) with their state or local public health agency that describes the authorization for requesting and receiving SNS assets and identifying the population that the base is responsible to serve. a.

After the trainee has received instructions, allow sufficient practice on each part of the task.  2.  Use the performance checklist to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished without assistance and without error.  3.  Document task competency upon completion of the evaluation in the trainee’s 6-part training/competency folder.  Initial evaluation should be documented in the CFETP.    STEPS IN TASK PERFORMANCE:  1. Be knowledgeable with DCP, Medical Contingency Readiness Plan (MCRP), 886E Allowance Standard and Storage of supplies and pharmaceuticals.  2.  Familiarize the POD layout, location and capabilities specific to installation.  3.  Demonstrate team member’s ability to perform pharmacy team roles and capabilities.
