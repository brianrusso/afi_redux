The member must bear the  cost  of  further  alterations,  except  during  initial  basic  or  follow-on  training  when  the government may pay for alterations to outer clothing required due to changes in physical profile. Replacement  of  the  outer  clothing  is  authorized  during  the  first  six  months  of  military  service when physical profile changes are such that the cost of alterations would exceed the replacement cost.  The  member’s  commander  must  certify  that  replacement  issue  is  more  economical  than alterations. (T-1) 2.1.1.  There  are  three  types  of  clothing  allowances  that  cover  initial  and  replacement uniform requirements: 2.1.1.1.  Initial  clothing  allowances.

In  a  national  emergency,  in  time  of  war,  or  at  such  other  times  as  recovery  of clothing  is  necessary,  or  in  the  Government’s  best  interest,  such  clothing  may  be recovered except for one uniform, appropriate to the season, to wear home.   6  AFI36-3014  23 NOVEMBER 2015 2.2.1.5.

Upon first reporting for active duty (other than for training) for a period of more than 90 days.

This  allowance  begins  accruing  on  the  first  day  of  month  following completion of six months of active duty service through the end of the 36th month of active duty.  A  pro-rated  amount  (one-half  of  the  fiscal  year  rate)  will  be  paid  upon  completion  of  the  12th month  of  uninterrupted  military  service.    Current  basic  cash  clothing  replacement  allowance rates are in DoDFMR 7000. 14-R, Vol 7A, Chapter 29, table 29-4. 3.5.  Standard  Cash  Clothing  Replacement  Allowance.  The  standard  cash  clothing replacement  allowance  is  provided  to  enlisted  Air  Force  members  to  fund  replacement  of military-unique  items  the  appropriate  official  requires  for  wear.    The  standard  clothing replacement allowance shall begin accruing on the first day following 36 months of active duty without regard to time lost.  The 36-month period begins on the date of last authorization to the initial  clothing  allowance  and  continues  during  the  remaining  period  of  continuous  active  duty service.    The  standard  clothing  replacement  allowance  is  paid  at  the  end  of  the  member’s anniversary  month.    Replacement  allowances  are  not  intended  to  totally  fund  a  member’s uniform or clothing purchases (ANG Title 32 members refer to para 3.9). (T-1) 3.6.  Establishing  Cash  Clothing  Replacement  Allowances.  Initial  and  clothing  allowances and annual clothing replacement allowances are approved by the HQ USAF/A1. 3.6.1.  DLA Troop Support will provide firm prices of initial clothing bag items along with supporting data to HQ USAF/A1SR by June 1 of each year. 3.6.2.   AFLCMC evaluates, determines, and provides a useful wear life of individual items in the initial clothing bag to HQ USAF/A1SR by June 1 of each year. 3.6.3.  HQ USAF/A1SR determines applicable annual replacement rates using an established formula  and  provides  AF/A1  the  recommended  rates  for  approval.    AF/A1SR  provides Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Systems  (DFAS)  the  approved  initial  clothing  and replacement  allowance  rates  for  the  next  applicable  fiscal  year.      DFAS  publishes  rates  in DoDFMR 7000. 14-R, Vol 7A, Chapter 29 (enlisted) and chapter 30 (Officers). 3.7.  Special  Initial  Clothing  Allowance:  The special initial clothing allowance is provided to Air  Force  members  upon  selection  and  acceptance  for  specified  officer-training  programs  and those  assigned  to  a  tour  of  duty,  or  status,  requiring  the  wear  of  uniform  clothing  (other  than special dress uniforms) of a style different from uniforms customary for most enlisted members of  the  Air  Force.    Only  one  Special  Initial  Allowance  is  authorized  during  any  period  of continuous  active  duty.    The  current  qualifying  assignments  and  rates  for  the  special  initial clothing allowance are located in DoDFMR 7000.14-R, Vol 7A, chapter 29, table 29-2. 3.8.  Special  Cash  Clothing  Replacement  Allowance.  The  special  cash  clothing  replacement allowance  is  provided  to  enlisted  Air  Force  members  to  fund  replacement  of  uniform  items subsequent  to  receipt  of  any  type  of  Special  Initial  Clothing  Allowance.    The  special  cash clothing replacement allowance shall begin accruing on the first day following completion of 36 months  of  active  duty  without  regard  to  time  lost.    The  36-month  period  begins  on  the  date  of last authorization to the initial clothing allowance and continues during the period for which the special cash clothing replacement allowance is payable. During this period no other cash clothing replacement allowance is authorized. (T-1)   10  AFI36-3014  23 NOVEMBER 2015 3.9.  Supplementary  Clothing  Allowance.  The  supplementary  clothing  allowance  is  provided to  enlisted Air  Force  members  when  assigned to  duty  in  a special  organization  or  detail  where the  nature  of  the  duty  necessitates  that  he  or  she  have,  as  a  military  requirement,  additional quantities or special items of individual uniform clothing normally not required for most enlisted members in the Air Force.  Current rates for these allowances are in DoDFMR 7000.14-R, Vol 7A, chapter 29, table 29-6.  Supplementary Clothing Allowances may not exceed 30 percent of the  current  value  of  the  Standard  Initial  Clothing  Allowance  (except  for  the  maternity supplementary  clothing  allowance).        The  unit  commander  determines  the  validity  of  each enlisted member’s need for this extra allowance using the following criteria: 3.9.1.     The clothing is needed for an exemplary (rather than creditable) appearance based on active military representation before groups of high-ranking military, civic, educational, business  or  foreign  dignitaries.  NOTE:  Active,  as  used  here,  means  giving  presentations, speeches, lectures, etc., or engaging in official business matters as the center of attention. It does not include marching, taking part in social events, or being present when high-ranking military or civilian dignitaries visit a facility or function. 3.9.2.  The individual must wear the uniform(s) full-time under abnormal working conditions or duty. 3.9.3.  The  individual  does  not  receive  more  than  one  such  allowance  for  the  same  basic uniform items during any period of continuous active duty unless: 3.9.3.1.  The  individual  reenlists  or  is  recalled  after  more  than  3  months  (from  date  of discharge or release from active duty) and meets all other requirements for the allowance. 3.9.3.2.  At least 3 years have lapsed since the initial need for a maternity uniform, and a new requirement exists. 3.9.3.3.  An individual who transfers from one AFSC or organization to another, in which a supplemental clothing allowance is authorized, is entitled to any additional items of the subsequent allowance. 3.9.3.4.  A  member  may  be  authorized  an  annual  supplementary  payment  as  outlined  in DoDFMR 7000.14-R, Vol 7A, chapter  29, table 29-6.  On the anniversary of the initial supplementary  clothing  allowance  payment,  an  annual  payment  may  be  authorized, provided the member is projected to remain in the qualifying assignment for at least an additional six months. The commander must verify in writing the member is entitled to a supplementary  clothing  allowance,  one  year  has  passed  since  the  last  payment,  and  the member is projected to remain in the qualifying assignment for an additional six months.  A member who has received a Supplementary Clothing Allowance may not be authorized a subsequent supplementary allowance for the same items upon reassignment to duty, if less than 12 months have elapsed since the last payment. 3.9.4.  The  Maternity  Supplemental  Clothing  Allowance.  The  maternity  supplemental clothing allowance is provided to enlisted active duty, ANG and reserve pregnant Air Force members.  Purchase  of  the  maternity  jumper  and  one  long  sleeve  blue  maternity  blouse  is mandatory.      This  combination  serves  as  their  service  dress  uniform.    At  the  member’s election, with the approval of the commander or first sergeant, the remaining balance of the maternity  allowance  may  be  used  to  purchase  uniform  articles  required  for  performance  of AFI36-3014  23 NOVEMBER 2015   11  duty.  This  allowance  is  paid  only  once  in  a  three-year  period;  subsequent  payment entitlement is based on the actual date of disbursement of previous payment(s). 3.9.5.  Requests for  Approval  of  a  New  or  Revised  Supplemental  Clothing Allowance.  Send  requests  for  new  or  revised  supplemental  clothing  allowances  through to:  USAF  Pentagon  AF-A1  Mailbox  AF-A1SRU your <usaf.pentagon.af-a1.mbx.af-a1sru@mail.mil>.

In  addition  to  any other  clothing  allowance  authorized,  an  Air  Force  member  directed  by  competent  authority  to dress  in  civilian  clothing  more  than  half  the  time  when  performing  official  duty,  as  a  military requirement  such  as  security  or  safety,  may  be  authorized  a  Civilian  Clothing  Allowance.  During  the  period  an  enlisted  member  is  required  to  wear  civilian  clothing,  the  annual  cash uniform  clothing  replacement  allowance  continues  to  accrue  as  they  are  required  to  maintain seven  full  sets  of  current  uniform  items.    EXCEPTION:    Members  of  Air  National  Guard  and Reserve components on active duty for periods of less than 180 days or on inactive duty are not entitled to Civilian Clothing Allowances.  Also, all civilian clothing allowance entitlements for officers is limited to those assigned to a permanent duty station at a location outside the United States. 4.1.1.  The  Military  Personnel  Flight  will  automatically  authorize  a  civilian  clothing allowance for enlisted personnel when: 4.1.1.1.  The Foreign Clearance Guide mandates  civilian clothing at  the member’s duty location. 4.1.1.2.  The  Joint  U.S.  Military  Assistance  Advisory  Group  certifies  a  requirement  for civilian clothing. 4.1.1.3.  A member is assigned to the White House Communications Agency. 4.1.1.4.  The Personnel Processing Code indicates civilian clothing must be worn. (T-3) 4.1.1.5.  Officers must meet one of the above criteria and have a permanent duty station outside of the United States. (T-2) 4.1.2.  Competent Authority for determining duty requiring the wear of civilian clothing is: 4.1.2.1.  MAJCOM Chief of Staff 4.1.2.2.  Assistant Secretaries of the Air Force 4.1.2.3.  Deputy Chiefs of Staff or their Assistants, HQ USAF 4.1.2.4.  U.S. Ambassador or equivalent 4.1.2.5.

(T-2) 4.2.  Types  of  Civilian  Clothing  Allowances.  There  are  two  types  of  civilian  clothing allowance  payments,  permanent  duty  civilian  clothing  allowance  and  temporary  duty  (TDY) civilian  clothing  allowance.    Current  rates  for  all  civilian  clothing  allowances  are  listed  in  the Department  of  Defense  Financial  Management  Regulation  7000.14-R,  Vol  7A,  Chapter  29.  Officer  civilian  clothing  allowance  is  limited  to  those  that  are  assigned  to  a  permanent  duty station at a location outside the United States 4.2.1.  Permanent Duty Civilian Clothing Allowance.  The permanent duty civilian clothing allowance  has  two  parts,  the  Initial  Civilian  Clothing  Allowance  and  the  Replacement Civilian  Clothing  Allowance.    The  Initial  Civilian  Clothing  Allowance  is  payable  upon assignment  to  a  qualifying  permanent  duty.    When  entitled,  the  Replacement  Civilian Clothing  Allowance  is  payable  annually  at  the  end  of  the  service  member’s  anniversary month  using  the  applicable  rate  then  in  effect.  The  rates  payable  for  the  Permanent  Duty Civilian Clothing Allowances are in DoDFMR 7000.14-R, Vol 7A, chapter 29, table 29-8. 4.2.1.1.  Initial  Civilian  Clothing  Allowance.    Payable  upon  assignment  to  qualifying permanent  duty  when  authorized.    An  Initial  Civilian  Clothing  Allowance  will  not  be paid more frequently than once in any 3-year period nor will it be paid if the member has been  out  of  a  qualifying  assignment  for  less  than  12  months.  If  the  member  receives  a follow-on permanent assignment requiring the wear of civilian clothing within 3 years of receiving  an  Initial  Civilian  Clothing  Allowance,  or  within  12  months  of  occupying  a qualifying  assignment,  then  he  or  she  will  receive  the  Replacement  Civilian  Clothing Allowance at the end of the original anniversary month. 4.2.1.2.  Replacement  Civilian  Clothing  Allowance.    Payable  annually  at  the  end  of  the service  member’s  anniversary  month  using  the  applicable  rate  then  in  effect.  A Replacement Civilian Clothing Allowance is payable if it is projected that he or she will serve  at  least  6  additional  months  in  a  qualifying  assignment.  If  it  is  projected  that  the member will remain in the assignment less than 6 months beyond the anniversary month, then  no  Replacement  Civilian  Clothing  Allowance  will  be  authorized.    However,  if  the member  then  actually  serves  6  or  more  months  in  the  assignment  past  the  anniversary month, then the replacement allowance will be paid and the  member’s anniversary date will be change to the date the allowance was actually paid.  Commanders must certify in writing  each  time  members  are  authorized  to  receive  the  Replacement  Permanent  Duty Civilian  Clothing  Allowance.  Certification  must  include  a  statement  members  are projected to remain in the assignment six months or more. 4.2.1.3.  Lump  Sum  Payments.    As  an  exception  to  policy,  the  office  of  the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management and Personnel may authorize payment of the Initial  Civilian  Clothing  Allowance  and  up  to  two  Replacement  Civilian  Clothing Allowance payments in an up-front lump sum to members projected to continue to meet the  eligibility  criteria  for  a civilian clothing  allowance  on a  career  basis.    Such  a lump-sum  payment  will  be  made  only  one  time  in  a  member’s  career  and  that  is  when  the member  first  becomes  eligible  for  the  civilian  clothing  allowance.    On  the  first  and second anniversaries of a lump-sum initial payment, if it is determined the member will not actually be remaining in a qualifying civilian clothing allowance position for at least AFI36-3014  23 NOVEMBER 2015   15  the next six months; the annual unearned portion for the year(s) not served in a qualifying assignment  will  be  recouped  from  the  member.    On  the  third  and  subsequent anniversaries of the member being eligible for the allowance, the member will be paid the permanent  duty  replacement  civilian  clothing  allowance.    Initial  Lump-Sum  payment requests  should  be  forwarded  to  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Force  Management and  Personnel,  staffed  through  the  member’s  major  command  or  equivalent,  HQ USAF/A1 and CSAF, and the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force. Disapproval authority for  the  initial  Lump-Sum  payment  is  any  level  in  the  member’s  chain  of  command  to include the Air Staff level. 4.2.1.3.1.  Enlisted  agents  from  the  Air  Force  Office  of  Special Investigations,  upon graduation from technical school, receive the initial permanent duty civilian clothing allowance and two replacement allowance payments in an up-front lump sum.  Such a lump-sum  payment  is  authorized  only  one  time  in  a  member’s  career.    On  the  third and  subsequent  duty  anniversaries,  the  member  will  be  paid  the  permanent  duty replacement civilian clothing allowance. 4.3.  Temporary  Duty  Civilian  Clothing Allowance.  Generally, the Temporary Duty Civilian Clothing  Allowance  is  for  use  when  the  Permanent  Duty  Civilian  Clothing  Allowance  is  not applicable.  The Temporary Duty Civilian Allowance has two maximum rates, one for temporary duty of at least 15 days within any 30-day period and one for temporary duty of at least 30 days within  any  36-month  period.    The  total  amount  of  all  Temporary  Duty  Civilian  Clothing Allowances  payable  in  any  36-month  period  will  not  exceed  the  maximum  allowed  for temporary  duty  of  at  least  30  days.    Exception:  The  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  may make  an  exception  to  the  36-month  payment  rule  and  authorize  an  additional  TDY  payment. Requests  for  the  exception  to  the  36-month  payment  rule  should  be  routed  through  the  Major Command  or  equivalent,  HQ  USAF/A1S,  the  appropriate  Air  Staff  functional  DCS,  to  the Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force.  Disapproval  authority  is  at  any  level  in  the  chain  of command, to include the Air Staff level.   NOTE:  TDY clothing allowances are not granted for entire  squadrons  or  work  sections;  they  are  approved  only  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  Officers eligibility  for  TDY  civilian  clothing  allowance  is  limited  to  those  that  are  assigned  to  a permanent  duty  station  at  a  location  outside  the  United  States.    Compute  entitlement  for  TDY allowance using any of the following criteria:  the date of first payment of a TDY allowance; the date departed TDY; or the date of performance of duty requiring the wear of civilian clothing. 4.3.1.  Temporary  Duty  of  at  least  15  Days.  When  competent  authority  determines  the member will be on temporary duty at least 15 consecutive or accumulative days within a 30-day  period.    The  15-day  threshold  requirement  does  not  apply  to  Explosive  Ordnance Disposal  and  Explosive  Detector  Dog  Personnel  on  United  States  Secret  Support  Duty, Defense  Courier  Service  couriers,  or  Defense  Threat  Reduction  Agency  military  personnel.  These  personnel  may  be  authorized  up  to  the  maximum  payment  for  temporary  duty  of  at least 30 days, upon their initial temporary duty assignment, regardless of the length of their temporary  duty.    The  maximum  amount  payable  shall  be  the  amount  located  in  DoDFMR 7000.14-R, Vol 7A, chapter 29, table 29-8.. (T-2) NOTE:  Do not authorize payment for in-flight  stopovers  where  civilian  clothes  must  be  worn.  Member  must  present  supporting documentation (e.g. travel orders) for payment of the 15 day accumulative TDY in a 30 day period entitlement.   16  AFI36-3014  23 NOVEMBER 2015 4.3.2.  Temporary  Duty  of  at  least  30  Days.  When competent authority determines that a member will be on temporary duty at least 30 consecutive or accumulative days within a 36-month period, the maximum amount payable is two-thirds the initial permanent duty civilian clothing allowance, less any amount paid within the past 36-month period for TDY civilian clothing allowance.  Current rates are in DoDFMR 7000.14-R, Vol 7A, chapter 29, table 29-8.  (T-2)    NOTE:    Do  not  authorize  payment  for  in-flight  stopovers  where  civilian  clothes must  be  worn.  The  member  must  present  supporting  documentation  (e.g.  travel  orders)  for payment when claiming TDY for 30 accumulative days in a 36-month period. 4.4.  Prior  Civilian  Clothing  Payments.  Members  who  received  a  TDY  civilian  clothing allowance  within  the  preceding  12  months  of  commencing  an  assignment  authorizing  a permanent  duty  civilian  clothing  allowance  will  have  the  permanent  duty  civilian  clothing allowance  offset  by  the  applicable  prevailing  temporary  duty  civilian  clothing  allowance. Likewise,  members  who  receive  the  permanent  duty  civilian  clothing  allowance  are  not authorized payment of a TDY civilian clothing allowance within the next 12 months.  Exception:  if it can be clearly demonstrated the type of clothing needed for the permanent duty and the TDY are  entirely  different.  In  this  case  Competent  Authority  can  authorize  full  payment  of  either allowance. Compute entitlement for prior clothing payments by using the date of first payment of a TDY allowance.
