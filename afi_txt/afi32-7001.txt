COOPER Lieutenant General, USAF DCS/Logistics, Engineering & Force Protection         Attachment: AFGM2017-01, Changes to AFI 32-7001, Environmental Management  AFI32-7001_AFGM2016-01 19 May 2016 Guidance Changes    (Replace the following paragraphs as shown below):  1.2. Vision. The AF EMS vision is for an effective framework to meet AF environmental obligations while achieving the mission in air, space, and cyberspace. The AF will remain committed to its environmental priorities and expect all Airmen to stay vigilant in minimizing the environmental risk and maintaining compliance in the execution of our global mission.  Figure 1.1 illustrates the linkage between the EMS framework and AF guidance. In line with the vision and IAW AFPD 90-8, the AF is committed to the following three priorities:   1.3.1.  EMS Implementation and Maintenance.  Per Executive Order (E.O.) 13693, Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade, and DoDI 4715.17, Environmental Management Systems, the AF will continue to implement and deploy formal EMSs as the appropriate framework to meet the goals of the E.O., the SAF/IE ESOH priorities of AFPD 32-70, and to achieve the desired performance in environmental management and sustainability.   The AF will ensure the EMS aligns with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard, Environmental Management Systems – Requirements with Guidance for Use, and subsequent updates, IAW federal, Department of Defense (DoD), and AF policy directives and guidance. The AF will ensure the EMS sustains and enhances mission capability by:  1.3.1.3.  Sustaining natural, cultural, built, and human resources that impact the environment, to include ensuring readiness by providing access to adequate natural infrastructure (NI), such as air, land, water, flora, and fauna assets, to support mission accomplishment.  1.3.1.4.  Communicating environmental program health by establishing criteria, tracking and reporting EMS effectiveness and incorporating EMS management reviews into Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health Councils (ESOHCs) at all AF levels. 1.3.1.6.  Ensuring elements of the EMS framework are tied to mission specific operations of appropriate organizational-levels. 1.3.1.7.  Developing and implementing goals and objectives that meet or exceed applicable federal, DoD, and AF performance measures.  (Add following paragraphs 1.4.5 and 1.4.6 shown below):  1.4.5.  eDASH.  eDASH is the AF’s active duty and reserve online Microsoft SharePoint tool that supports the EMS standardization methodology and approach as the one stop source for AF environmental and sustainability programs at all levels. It provides a central repository and clearing house for AF enterprise-wide programs to ensure consistent procedures and performance measures for more efficient and effective information management exchange, communications, operational controls, and program management reviews at all levels.  The eDASH website (https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10040/) functions as an electronic EMS manual that fulfills the requirements of this Instruction to develop and maintain effective processes and EMS documentation (if populated and maintained IAW this Instruction) to ensure conformance and mission effectiveness.   1.4.6.  VEMO.  VEMO functions and provides the same objective for the ANG as eDASH, but is based on the ANG’s unique requirements and authorities and is thus aligned independent of eDASH.  VEMO serves as the functioning organizational EMS manual for ANG, as well as a tool to aid in communication between NGB/A4A, AF, and individual ANG installations. The VEMO websites (https://intelshare.intelink.gov/sites/vemo) fulfill the requirements of this Instruction to develop and maintain effective processes and EMS documentation (if populated and maintained IAW this Instruction).

AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 1.3.1.  EMS Implementation and Maintenance.  Per Executive Order (E.O.) 13693, Planning for  Federal  Sustainability  in  the  Next  Decade  and  DoDI  4715.17,  Environmental Management System, the AF shall establish and maintain an EMS.  The AF will ensure the EMS  conforms  to  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  14001:2004 standard,  Environmental  Management  Systems  –  Requirements  with  guidance  for  use,  and subsequent updates, IAW federal and Department of Defense (DoD) guidelines.  The AF will ensure the EMS sustains and enhances mission capability by: 1.3.1.1.  Maintaining compliance with all applicable environmental laws, regulations, and policy requirements. 1.3.1.2.  Reducing  compliance  burden  by  implementing  pollution  prevention  (P2) solutions that reduce the quantity and impact of pollutants. 1.3.1.3.  Sustaining natural, cultural, built, and human resources. 1.3.1.4.  Incorporating  EMS  and  Environmental,  Safety,  and  Occupational  Health (ESOH) considerations into installation Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21) Lean Events to improve mission capacity and prevent waste. 1.3.1.5.  Providing community outreach to increase awareness of environmental issues. 1.3.1.6.  Incorporating  EMS  elements organizational-levels and installations. into specific  operations  of  appropriate 1.3.1.7.  Meeting or exceeding current Office of Management and Budget (OMB), DoD, and AF performance measures. 1.4.  Methodology. 1.4.1.  Asset Management (AM).  Enhancing the existing compliance-focused environmental program  with  AM  and  EMS  principles  allows  the  AF  to:  sustain  and  modernize  its  asset portfolio;  increase  mission  capability;  achieve  federal  sustainability  goals;  maintain compliance  with  federal,  state,  and  local  laws,  country-specific  Final  Governing  Standards (FGSs) or DoD Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD) standards if no FGSs exist, binding obligations under international agreements, and DoD and AF policy and guidance; and restore contaminated sites with reduced environmental mission impacts. 1.4.2.  EMS  Framework.   This  Instruction  provides  HAF,  AFCEC,  FOAs,  DRUs, installations, and all other AF units with a framework for developing and maintaining either an  organizational-level  EMS  or  an  installation  EMS.  It  integrates  environmental  impact analysis, operational risk management, and P2 into the EMS to institute sustainable practices across  the  AF  mission  and  reduce  both  environmental  risk  and  the  AF’s  environmental footprint.  This  Instruction  establishes  key  requirements  using  EMS  principles  for  planning, programming, implementing, and monitoring to ensure an effective environmental program. 1.4.3.  Weapon Systems (WSs).  WS acquisition and sustainment program offices follow the systems  engineering  policy  and  guidance  in  DoDI  5000.02,  Operation  of  the  Defense Acquisition  System,  The  Defense  Acquisition  Guidebook,  and  AFI  63-101,  Integrated  Life Cycle  Management  (Chapter  5),  to  manage  the  environmental  aspects  and  possible  impacts of the systems they develop and sustain. These systems engineering policies and procedures AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 9 comply  with  the  intent  and  the  requirements  of  an  EMS.  AFI  32-7001  and  AFI  32-7086, Hazardous  Materials  Management,  link  the  installation  and  organizational-level  EMS  to these  acquisition  and  sustainment  systems  engineering  processes.  When  an  EMS  Cross-Functional  Team  (CFT)  identifies  environmental  aspects  that  need  to  be  addressed  by changes  to  the  WS  design  or  procedures,  the  EMS  team  uses  the  procedures  in  these  32-series documents to insert those needs into the WS change processes. 1.4.4.  EMS  playbook.    Additional  and  more  detailed  information  can  be  found  in  the  non-directive process EMS playbook published on the AF CE A4C Portal. 10 AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Types  of  Environmental  Management  Systems  (EMS).  The  AF  has  three  types  of EMSs:  organizational-level,  multi-site-level,  and  installation-level.  Attachment  3  lists  the requirements for each type. 3.1.1.  Organizational-Level  EMS.    An  organizational-level  EMS  contains  those  elements necessary for setting and transmitting objectives and targets to lower units and for collecting, packaging,  and  reporting  accomplishments  and  compliance.  An  organizational-level  EMS seldom contains all the elements of an ISO 14001-conforming EMS and those elements that it  does  contain  may/may  not  conform  to  the  ISO  14001  specifications.  The  Federal Environmental  Executive  has  exempted  organizational-level  EMSs  from  the  federal requirement for periodic Declaration of Conformance. 3.1.1.1.  The  HAF  ESOHC’s  Steering  Committee  oversees  the  AF  EMS.  This organizational-level  EMS  serves  to  flow  down  environmental  requirements  through  the AFCEC,  ANG,  AFRC,  and  other  appropriate  organizational-levels  to  the  installations. The  ESOH  Steering  Committee  members  responsible  for  military  activities  with environmental impacts shall: 3.1.1.1.1.  Include  specific  environmental  sustainability  objectives  and  targets  into their  operational  or  implementing  instructions,  as  appropriate.  The  ESOH  Steering Committee should address objectives and targets by developing programmatic EAPs applicable  to  subordinate  organizations  and  installations  in  order  for  the  AF  to comply  with  requirements  imposed  by  federal  authorities,  including  OMB,  Council on  Environmental  Quality  (CEQ),  Office  of  the  Federal  Environmental  Executive (OFEE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), DoD, etc. 3.1.1.1.2.  Include mandated federal regulations and guideline goals in the HAF EMS as  objectives  and  targets,  which  are  reflected  in  action  plans  created  under installation-level EMSs. 3.1.1.1.3.  Include  procedures reviewing:  AF-wide environmental  policy,  legal  and  other  requirements,  objectives  and  targets,  EAPs, ESOHC,  communications  and  data  gathering,  assessments,  environmental  training, environmental  sustainability  performance  measures,  management  review,  and reporting. for  establishing  and/or 3.1.1.1.4.  Collect,  analyze  and  report  AF  performance  information  and  significant aspects to higher authority (ESOHC, OSD, etc.). sustainability 3.1.1.1.5.  Track  performance performance  measures  and  DoD  sustainability  goals  and  determine  return  on investment and reduction of environmental impact. toward  meeting environmental 3.1.2.  Multi-site  EMS.    A  multi-site  EMS  requires  conformance  with  the  specifications  in the  ISO  14001  standard.  The  multi-site  EMS  encompasses  more  than  one  installation  or facility. The key attribute of a multi-site EMS is the management of environmental aspects of all the sites’ activities, products, and services, as one EMS. This type of EMS is not exempt AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 29 from  the  federal  requirement  for  periodic  Declaration  of  Conformance  (after  an  external EMS  audit  has  been  completed).  A  multi-site  EMS  may  be  appropriate  and  useful  where  a number of small locations have little to no environmental resources and receive support and direction  from  another  higher-level  organization,  location,  or  installation.  Examples  of  a multi-site EMS are an Air Base Wing’s EMS that includes the parent installation and all of its  geographically  separated  units  (GSUs)  or  the  ANG’s  EMS  where  multiple  small installations fall under a centralized ANG system. 3.1.3.  Installation  EMS.    Installation  EMSs  must  meet  the  DoD  requirement  for  periodic Declaration of Conformance (by using external EMS audits, which require accomplishment once  every  three  years).  (T-0).  The  scope  of  an  installation  EMS includes  all  organizations and  facilities  within  the  boundary  and/or  span  of  control  of  the  host  organization. Installations shall consider and include DoD, HAF and AFCEC objectives and targets in the installation level EMS. (T-0). Figure 3.1.  EMS Policy and Planning. 3.2.  Required  Elements.  The  following  are  required  EMS  elements  for  AF  multi-site  and installation level EMSs (For more guidance refer to the EMS playbook published on the AF CE Portal (https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/ceportal/CEPlaybooks/Pages/default.aspx).  3.2.1.  Scope (paragraph 3.3.1.). 3.2.2.  Environmental Policy/Commitment Statement (paragraph 3.3.2.). 3.2.3.  Environmental Aspects and Impacts (paragraph 3.3.3.). 3.2.4.  Legal and Other Requirements (paragraph 3.3.4.). 3.2.5.  Objectives, Targets, and Programs (Action Plans) (paragraph 3.3.5.). 3.2.6.  Resources, Roles, and Responsibilities (paragraph 5.2.). 3.2.7.  Communication (paragraph 5.3.). 3.2.8.  Documentation Management, Control, and Records Management (paragraph 5.4.). 3.2.9.  Emergency Preparedness and Response (paragraph 5.5.). 3.2.10.  Competence Training and Awareness (paragraph 5.6.). 3.2.11.  Operational Controls (paragraph 5.7.). 3.2.12.  Monitoring and Measurement (paragraphs 7.1.-7.5.). 3.2.13.  Evaluation of Compliance and Conformance (paragraph 7.2.). 30 AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 3.2.14.  Corrective and Preventive Action (paragraph 7.6.). 3.2.15.  Management Review (paragraphs 8.1.-8.3.). 3.3.  Planning.  The EMS Planning Phase includes scope, environmental policy and commitment statement,  environmental  aspects  and  impacts,  legal  and  other  requirements,  objectives  and targets,  and  action  plans.  Effective  planning  allows  the  installation’s  leadership  to  focus resources on mitigating risks that present the greatest threat to mission capability. 3.3.1.  Scope. 3.3.1.1.  Installations must define and document the scope of the EMS. (T-1). The scope may be limited by excluding certain  organizations such as those with  different  chain  of command  authority  (e.g.,  Army  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES)  or  Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), as long as covered under a separate EMS, or if aspects are deemed to be outside of the installation’s ability to effectively control or influence. Joint Base  installations,  where  the  AF  is  the  supporting  (lead)  military  service,  will  ensure  a single  EMS  with  a  limited  scope  that  only  incorporates  those  program  elements  over which  the  AF  has  span  of  control  IAW  DoD-issued  Environmental  Common  Output Level Standards (COLS). (T-0). 3.3.1.2.  The  EMS  Coordinator  shall  ensure  any  organizations  deemed  outside  of  the scope are aware of the scope determination. (T-1). 3.3.1.3.  Installations  shall  consult  with  AFCEC/CZ  (NGB/A7A  in  the  case  of  ANG bases) on the scope of their EMS. (T-1). 3.3.1.4.  Installations  must  document  their  scope  in  the  installation’s  eDASH  page (VEMO for ANG bases). (T-1). 3.3.2.  Environmental Policy/Commitment Statement. 3.3.2.1.  AFPD  90-8  is  the  ESOH  Policy  for  the  AF.  Key  expectations  of  AFPD  90-8 need to be communicated to all persons working for, or on behalf of, the installation. 3.3.2.2.  Installations  must  provide  an  environmental  commitment  statement,  including their specific mission requirements and regional/local environmental concerns.  (T-0).  In the environmental commitment statement installations must: 3.3.2.2.1.  Be  appropriate  to  the  nature,  scale,  and  environmental  impacts  of  its activities, products, and services. (T-1). 3.3.2.2.2.  Include a commitment to continual improvement and P2. (T-1). 3.3.2.2.3.  Include  a  commitment  to  comply  with  applicable  legal  and  policy requirements (including standards in the country-specific FGS or OEBGD, if an FGS does  not  exist)  and  with  other  requirements  to  which  the  organization  subscribes which relate to its environmental aspects. (T-0). 3.3.2.2.4.  Provide the framework for setting and reviewing environmental objectives and targets, including those required by DoD, HAF and/or AFCEC. (T-0). 3.3.2.3.  The  EMS  Coordinator  will  ensure  the  commitment  statement  is  documented, implemented,  and  maintained  on  the  installation  eDASH  page  (or  VEMO  for  ANG bases). (T-1). Installations will ensure statements meet the following: AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 31 3.3.2.3.1.  Reviewed  and  approved  by  the  installation  ESOHC  at  least  annually.      (T-1). 3.3.2.3.2.  Communicated  to  all  persons  working  for,  or  on  behalf,  of  the organization. (T-1). 3.3.2.3.3.  Available to the public. (T-2). 3.3.3.  Environmental Aspects and Impacts. 3.3.3.1.  The  installation  CFT  shall  document  aspects  and  impacts  for  the  installation‘s activities, products, and services. (T-1). Aspects are elements of the activities, products, and  services  that  can  interact  with  the  environment  and  produce  either  a  negative  or  a positive environmental impact. Aspects classified as significant are managed in the EMS by setting of objectives and targets, establishing EAPs, and applying operational controls.  The  CE  EMS  playbook  provides  AFCEC  procedures  for  updating/identifying  the environmental  aspects  annually  and  documenting  aspects  and  impacts  in  the  AFCEC Aspect Inventory Tool on eDASH (VEMO for ANG bases). 3.3.3.2.  The installation CFT shall ensure an EAP is developed for significant aspects, as determined by the base,  AFCEC/CZ, or HAF.   (T-1). The EAP tool on eDASH will be used  to  document  the  EAP.  (T-1).  Follow  the  CE  EMS  playbook  and  guidance  on eDASH for procedures on using EAPs to address significant aspects. 3.3.3.3.  The  CFT  shall  consider  the  requirements  of  installation  planning  documents, AMPs, Strategic Plans (HAF, A4C), regulatory and other requirements (e.g., E.O.s, Host Tenant  Support  Agreements,  COLS),  in  determining  environmental  impacts  and corrective actions. (T-1). 3.3.3.4.  The  Installation  Development  Plan  (IDP)  IAW  AFI  32-7062,  Comprehensive Planning,  establishes  a  systematic  framework  for  informing  decision-making  by providing the Installation Commander and other decision-makers a condensed picture of an  installation's  capability  to  support  the  mission  with  its  physical  assets  and  delivery systems.  It  is  also  a  general  assessment  of the installation’s infrastructure and attributes for gauging development potential. It provides an integrated context and advocacy for the multiple AF processes that support and sustain current and future missions. The EMS, to include  environmental  aspects  and  impacts  provides  environmental  informational  data points and sustainability development indicators to assist in planning determinations for the IDP. 3.3.3.5.  The EAP captures program specific requirements and management actions for an environmental aspect, and is designed to achieve the objectives and targets, tasks, and the reliable  application  of  operational  controls.  EAPs  include  environmental  compliance, conservation,  restoration,  and  P2  requirements,  and  may  include  concerns  identified during  other  assessments  and  inspections.  For  CE,  these  should  be  consistent  with  CE AMP requirements. 3.3.3.6.  The  AMP  captures  all  the  requirements  necessary  for  providing  particular services the  following  areas:  facilities,  utilities,  pavements,  NI,  and  waste management.  AMPs  consider  installation  significant  aspects  and  elements  from  the in 32 AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 EAPs,  which  address  operational  controls  and  the  tasks  to  be  completed  in  order  to achieve the environmental objectives and targets. 3.3.4.  Legal and Other Requirements. 3.3.4.1.  The  CFT  shall  supplement  AFCEC  procedures  for  identifying  and  assessing legal  and  other  requirements  applicable  to  the  environmental  aspects  of  its  mission activities, products, and services. This supplement should be reviewed at least annually. (T-2). 3.3.4.2.  AF installations will ensure a process for conducting timely reviews of new and emerging state, regional, and local requirements. (T-1). 3.3.4.3.  Installations  must  document  on  eDASH  relevant  state,  regional,  and  local regulations applicable to the installation. (T-1). 3.3.5.  Objectives, Targets, and Programs (Action Plans). 3.3.5.1.  Installations  shall  set,  manage,  and  update  objectives  and  targets  to  achieve federal, DoD, or AF sustainability goals; reduce environmental risk; and sustain mission capability. (T-0). Installations will consider federal, state, and overseas requirements, and strategic objectives and targets established by DoD and HAF, when setting objectives and targets. (T-0). 3.3.5.2.  AFCEC/CZ and installations shall: 3.3.5.2.1.  Set  measureable  objectives  and  targets  consistent  with  AFPD  90-8,  in compliance  with  applicable  legal  requirements,  and  provide  continual  improvement. (T-0). AFCEC/CZ and installations will use the P2 methodology to set objectives and targets,  taking  into  account  significant  environmental  aspects  and  legal  and  other requirements. (T-0). 3.3.5.2.2.  Consider  feasible business requirements, and the views of interested parties. (T-2). technological  options,  financial,  operational,  and 3.3.5.2.3.

This  chapter  is  part  of  the  EMS  Planning  Phase  and provides  guidance  on  programming  and  budgeting  for  the  AF  EQ  Program.  The  EQ Programming and Budgeting process provides the necessary resources to achieve the goals  and objectives of the AF Strategic Plan, the organizational-level,  multi-site, or installation EMS, or other major program objectives; and instructions resulting in an auditable and transparent budget. The EQ program includes the Program Elements (PEs) of compliance, conservation, and P2. For Environmental  Restoration  Account  instruction,  refer  to  AFI  32-7020,  The  Environmental Restoration Program. Figure 4.1.  EMS Planning.  4.1.1.  Three  documents  govern  the  EQ  Programming  and  Budgeting  process:  EQ Programming  Matrix,  EQ  Standard  Titles,  and  EQ  Scoring  Model.  The  EQ  Programming Matrix identified in Attachment 4, is the authoritative source for determining environmental O&M funding  eligibility.  Specific information and electronic versions are available on the eDASH PPBE page: (https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/edash/Web%20Part%20Pages%20%20Program%20Pages/Environmental/Environmental%20Quality%20(EQ)%20Planning%20Programming%20Budgeting%20and%20Execution.aspx). Additional, and more detailed guidance, can be found in the non-directive EQ Programming and Budgeting Process playbook published on the A4C Portal (https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/ceportal/CEPlaybooks/Pages/default.aspx). 4.1.1.1.  The  EQ  Program  Element  Codes  (PEC)  for  Compliance,  Conservation,  and  P2 comprise  the  EQ  Programming  Matrix.  Each  PEC  is  further  divided  by  Level  0,  Valid-Recurring Level 1, 2, 3, and Not Valid requirements. Use the EQ Programming Matrix to determine if the requirement is valid or not valid for EQ funding. 4.1.1.2.  The  EQ  Standard  Titles  document  is  organized  by  major  work  tasks,  (e.g., temporary duty (TDY), Training, Reports, Plans, and Assessments) and includes specific details  for  standardized  programming.  Use  the  EQ  Standard  Titles  to  program  all standardized requirements. AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 35 4.1.1.3.  The  Scoring  Model  utilizes  five  scoring  factors:  Return  on  Investment  (ROI), Environmental  Risk,  Regulatory  Category,  Mission  Degradation,  and  Stakeholder Interest. Each installation shall apply the EQ Scoring Model to each requirement. (T-1). respective 4.1.2.  Installations  or  AFCEC/CZ  shall  enter  all  EQ  requirements  into  AF-approved software  following  the  EQ  Programming  guides  and  supplemental  budgeting  policy  and guidance provided in Attachments 4 and 5. (T-1). AFCEC/CZ, AFRC, and ANG shall review their for  validity;  AFCEC/CZ  provides  assessment  and recommendation,  and  HAF  /A4C  advocates,  and  where  applicable,  submits,  for  funding. AFCEC,  AFRC,  and  ANG  are  responsible  for  ensuring  consistent  interpretation  of  the  EQ Programming Matrix and Scoring Model across their installations. (T-1). In turn, AFCEC/CZ will  use  the  individual  scores  for  validated  projects  to  prepare  an  AF-wide  EQ  IPL  and ensure integrated into the CE IPL. (T-1). requirements 4.1.2.1.  Prioritization of EQ projects should reflect the results from the prioritized list of EMS aspects. (T-2). Table 4.1.  PEC Applicability by Appropriation. 4.2.  Project  Planning  and  Programming  –  Program  Objective  Memorandum  (POM)  and Program Execution. 4.2.1.  AFCEC,  AFRC,  and  ANG  shall  plan  and  program,  using  AF  approved  program management software, to include entering funding information by project line item. (T-1). 4.2.2.  AFCEC,  AFRC,  and  ANG  must  develop  POM  submittals  to  achieve  the  EMS objectives reflective of the prioritized environmental aspects. (T-2).  36 AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 4.2.3.  AFCEC,  AFRC,  and  ANG  shall  track  the  rate  of  obligation  for  their  respective appropriations.    Upon  obligation,  enter  relevant  information  in  the  programming  software. (T-1). 4.2.4.  In preparation for the execution year prior to distribution, AFCEC, AFRC, and ANG shall ensure that the validated EQ Program established in the POM and/or financial/execution plan  is  still  supported,  ensuring  that  all  environmental  compliance  legal  requirements  are met. (T-1). 4.3.  Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM), EQ, and Military Construction (MILCON).  EQ  funding  can  be  used  for  the  cost  of  initial  construction,  modification,  or upgrade  to  the  relevant  portion  of  a  facility,  system,  or  component(s)  in  order  to  comply  with new  environmental  laws  or  regulations.  Existing  infrastructure  systems  should  be  maintained, repaired,  and  replaced  with  SRM  funds  and  not  EQ  (see  AFI  32-1032,  Planning  and Programming Appropriated Funded Maintenance, Repair, and Construction Projects), with the following exceptions: 4.3.1.  An infrastructure repair, replacement, or upgrade project is eligible for EQ funding if the project is needed to comply with new federal or state environmental laws or regulations with discharge limits, or, if overseas, OEBGD or country-specific FGS, and/or international agreement  requirements.  This  does not  include new requirements levied from infrastructure or capacity deficiencies. 4.3.2.  An infrastructure repair, replacement, or upgrade (that is of MILCON scope) could be eligible for funding as an Environmental, Health, and Safety MILCON project if the project is needed to comply with new federal  and state discharge limits or, if overseas, OEBGD or country-specific  FGS,  and  applicable  international  agreement  requirements.  This  does  not include new requirements levied from infrastructure capacity deficiencies. Health and Safety MILCON  projects  compete  with  other  MAJCOM  MILCON  priorities  IAW  the  current HAF/A4C programming process. For more information on MILCON programming see AFI 32-1001,  Operations  Management,  AFI  32-1021,  Planning  and  Programming  Military Construction Projects, and AFI 32-1023, Designing and Constructing Military Construction Projects. 4.3.3.  If an installation receives a formal notice of non-compliance or has received a major finding in an ECAMP assessment or an IG UEI (validated by AFCEC/CZ, AFRC, or ANG, and  HAF),  an  infrastructure  project  to  correct  the  non-compliant  portion  of  the  facility, system,  or  component  may  be  eligible  for  EQ  funding  as  long  as  the  waiver  request  is submitted with a description and analysis of the non-compliance situation. 4.3.3.1.  As  part  of  a  request  for  EQ  funding  support  for  non-compliance,  AFCEC, AFRC, or ANG shall accomplish an engineering evaluation for the non-compliant portion to  document  specifically  what  facilities,  portion(s)  or  components(s)  of  the  system  are non-compliant, and why the EQ project scope and programmed amount are necessary to correct the non-compliance. (T-1).  4.3.3.2.  HAF/A4C will need to assess the seriousness of the situation based on history of compliance and preventive repair and maintenance actions taken to date. 4.3.4.  AFCEC/CZ  will  submit  a  waiver  package  request  for  deviations  from  the  EQ Programming  Matrix  to  AF/A4CE  for  approval  for  use  of  EQ  funding.  (T-1).  The  waiver AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 37 package  will justification,  cost,  program  element, environmental driver, an engineering evaluation and preventative actions taken to date. (T-1). include  a  detailed  description, 4.4.  OCONUS  Environmental  Remediation.  For  guidance,  see the  HAF/A4CF  EQ Programming  Matrix  for  Non-Environmental  Restoration  Account  Cleanup  and  Overseas Remediation. 4.5.  Programming for Overseas Environmental Requirements. 4.5.1.  Enduring  locations  in  foreign  countries  will  program  and  budget  for  environmental requirements  stemming  from:  (T-1).  1)  country-specific  FGS,  or  the  OEBGD  if  no  FGS exists; 2) obligations from international agreements to which the U.S. is a part; 3) remedial actions  necessary  to  address  contamination  that  pose  a  substantial  impact  to  human  health and  safety;  4)  the  EIAP,  in  compliance  with  E.O.  12114,  Environmental  Effects  Abroad  of Major  Federal  Actions,  and  32  C.F.R.  187,  Environmental  Effects  Abroad  of  Major Department  of  Defense  Actions,  for  all  major  AF  actions  that  pose  significant  harm  to  the environment  of  places  outside  the  U.S.;  and  5)  any  additional  DoD  and  AF  environmental policies that apply to overseas installations and activities. 4.5.1.1.  AFCEC  Europe  and  Pacific  Division  Environmental  functions  (i.e.  IECs)  shall assist  installations  with  programming  and  execution.  (T-1).  Where  practicable,  the installation will identify and program requirements while AFCEC provides technical and programming  assistance  as  needed.  (T-1).  AFCEC  will  coordinate  with  installations  to consolidate  programming  requirements  to  improve  cost,  quality,  consistency  of programming, and to facilitate optimized execution. (T-1). 4.5.2.  Enduring  location  (e.g.,  installation)  Program  Element  Managers  (PEMs)  take  into consideration the following unique attributes of overseas operations when programming and budgeting for overseas requirements: 1) the AF does not own overseas installations (locations are  provided  for  AF  use  by  the  Host  Nation);  2)  few  U.S.  federal  environmental  laws  and regulations apply as DoD policy and international law and agreements define environmental requirements;  3)  operational  considerations  (which include  Geographic  Combatant Command  (GCC)  policy  and  Host  Nation  preferences  and  sensitivities);  4)  requirements potentially more stringent and expensive than in the U.S.; 5) remediation is permitted under very  limited  circumstances;  and  6)  constant  turnover  of  personnel  creates  challenges  with continuity and adequate staffing. Refer to the EQ Programming Guide in section 4.1.1 of this Instruction for further guidance. 4.5.3.  For  environmental  needs  and  requirements  at  contingency  locations  in  foreign countries,  refer  to  the  Environmental  Annex  of  the  operation  plan  (OPLAN)  or  operation order (OPORD), DoD 7000.14-R, Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation (DoD  FMR),  and  AFI  65-610,  Guidance  for  Expenditures  at  Deployed  Locations.  Per  the contingency  operations  provisions  of  the  DoD  FMR,  Volume  12,  Chapter  23,  Contingency Operations,  DoD  Components  normally  do  not  budget  for  contingency  operations. Therefore,  DoD  Components  must  accomplish  directed  contingency  operations  using  funds available  (e.g.,  O&M)  to  the  cognizant  command  or  unit,  independent  of  the  receipt  of specific  funds  for  the  operation.  The  authority  for  DoD  Components  to  expend  available funds is issued by the Secretary of Defense. 38 AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 4.5.4.  When available,  DoD transfer funds  (e.g., Overseas Contingency  Operation Transfer Fund  (OCOTF),  Defense  Emergency  Response  Fund  (DERF))  can  be  used  to  support contingency  operations,  including  environmental  actions  necessary  to  protect  the  force. However,  expenditures  of  regular  appropriated  funds  or  transfer  funds  are  still  bound  by existing  financial  management  regulations  and  appropriations  laws,  regardless  of  funding availability  or  source,  and  are  limited  by  what  is  necessary  to  accomplish  the  mission  as authorized in existing AF guidance. Refer to AFI 65-610 for further guidance. AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 39 Chapter 5 IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION 5.1.  Implementation  and  Operation.

The  installation  shall  communicate  applicable  procedures  and  requirements  to suppliers  and  service  providers,  including  contractors,  IAW  FAR  52.223-5,  Pollution Prevention, and Right-to-Know Information. (T-0). AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 43 Chapter 6 POLLUTION PREVENTION INTEGRATION 6.1.  Background.  P2  is  part  of  the  EMS  Do  Phase  and  is  an  environmental  risk  reduction strategy  for  environmental  aspects  associated  with  the  processes  or  activities  that  generate pollutants.  Each  facility  shall  use  their  EMS  to  identify  opportunities  to  optimize  selected business,  operational,  or industrial processes or activities in terms  of pollutant reduction, lower energy  use,  reduction  in  the  use  of  natural  resources,  water  conservation  and  improvements  to health  and  safety.  (T-1).  Installations  should  identify  P2  efforts,  programs  related  to  green procurement  or  acquisition  of  environmentally  preferable  products,  and  other  sustainability requirements, within the installation EMS, as well as incorporate into installation BCAMPs and related  programming  and  planning  requirements/documents.    Refer  to  the  AF/A4C  Portal  for additional information. Figure 6.1.  P2 in the EMS Implementation and Operation Phase.  6.2.  Hazardous  Process  Authorization  (HPA).  The  HPA  is  an  ESOH-based  process authorization as described in AFI 32-7086. It evaluates the aspects/impacts of discrete AF units of work or processes. This authorization can include an analysis of impacts on air, water, land, waste, safety, and occupational health. All HPA analyses utilize the P2 methodology to identify opportunities  for  environmental  risk  reduction.  This  review  should  include  NI  impacts  beyond HAZMAT. All media POCs shall be involved. (T-1). 6.3.  WSP2.  AFI  32-7086  covers  P2  involving  WS  HAZMATs.  WS  program  managers  have engineering  control  over  WSs  and  their  maintenance  processes.  All  WS  ESOH  risk  reduction projects  must  include  the  involvement  of  the  affected  WS  program  manager(s)  and  other appropriate stakeholders (such as the operations, maintenance, and customers) requirements. (T-1).  Once  the  program  manager  is  involved,  multiple  sources  of  funding  are  available  for executing a WSP2 project. 6.4.  SPP.  Sustainable  Procurement  is  the  purchase  of  sustainable  and  environmentally preferable  products  and  services  in  accordance  with  federally  mandated  "green"  procurement preference  programs.  The  purpose  of  the  SPP  is  to  enhance  and  sustain  mission  readiness through cost effective acquisition that achieves compliance and sound management of the AF’s 44 AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 financial,  natural,  and  energy  resources.  Through  the  P2  methodology  outlined  below,  all  AF organizations  making  purchases  or  product  specifications  for  purchases  will  use  the  SPP  as  a routine  part  of  day-to-day  purchasing  activities  to  reduce  resource  consumption  and  solid  and HW generation. (T-1). 6.5.  P2 Methodology.  Organizations at all levels of the AF shall use the P2 hierarchy in Table 6.1  to  select  objectives  and  targets  to  eliminate,  reduce,  or  manage  the  impacts  of  their significant  aspects.  (T-1).  Solutions  adopted  by  the  application  of  P2  methodology  should  not shift or increase risk in other areas, such as operations, safety, and/or health. Table 6.1.  P2 Methodology.  AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 45 6.6.  P2  Opportunity  Assessments  (P2OAs).  P2OAs the environmental aspects of all media associated with a process that generates pollution and/or has a negative  impact  on  the  environment.  Focusing  on  the  entire  process  allows  identification  of multiple  potential  opportunities  for  the  various  sub-processes.  The  EMS  playbook  on  the AF/A4C Portal contains a sample procedure for conducting P2OAs. the  study  of  all integrate 6.6.1.  Significant  Aspects.    Installations  will  use  P2OAs  to  examine  the  significant environmental aspects that generate pollutants. (T-1). 6.6.1.1.  Identify pollutant sources by examining the materials entering a process (or are part of the process) and the wastes and other pollutants generated by it (type and volume). Potential options for changing the process, such as alternative chemicals/materials and/or procedures  (e.g.,  media  blasting  vs.  chemical  paint  stripping),  are  examined  against  the current  process  to  determine  if  a  more  environmentally  friendly  (and  cost  effective) approach can be taken. 6.6.1.2.  Installations  will  consider  a  cost-benefit  analysis  (CBA)  when  evaluating potential P2 opportunities. (T-1). 6.6.2.  HPAs.  Each  HPA  is  an  informal  P2OA.  Installations  will  integrate  results  of  HPAs into appropriate EAPs, operational controls, and/or formal P2OAs. (T-1). 6.6.3.  P2  Program  Budgeting.    Organizations  that  have  significant  environmental  aspects shall  be  responsible  for  planning  and  budgeting  for  P2  opportunities,  and  for  reporting  P2 investments  to  the  ESOHC,  as  required.  (T-1).  CE  funding  for  P2  opportunities  to  address activities/processes  with  a  negative  environmental  impact  is  processed  IAW  the  procedures listed in  this  Instruction  (Chapter 4). These P2  requirements should be included in  relevant A4C sponsored AMPs.  6.6.3.1.  AFCEC  will  facilitate  use  of  Broad  Agency  Announcements  (BAA)  to  cross-feed or review opportunities for non-weapons related CE investments in  P2 technology. (T-1). 6.6.3.2.  Air  Force  Research  Laboratory,  Materials  and  Manufacturing  Directorate (AFRL/RX) consolidates and reports information on AF-related P2 investments through the  Strategic  Environmental  Research  and  Development  Program  (SERDP)  and AFMC/A4  does  the  same  through  the  Environmental  Security  Technology  Certification Program (ESTCP). 46 AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 Chapter 7 MONITORING AND MEASURING ENVIRONMETNAL PERFORMANCE 7.1.  Overview.  Environmental monitoring and measuring is part of the EMS Check Phase. The purpose  of  environmental  monitoring  and  measuring  is  to  increase  leadership  awareness  of compliance issues; identify and analyze trends of non-conformance and non-compliance; identify areas  for  improvement;  provide  lessons  learned  to  prevent  similar  non-compliance  at  other installations;  and  to  minimize  or  avoid  environmental  litigation  risks.  AFCEC  and  installations will conduct monitoring, measuring, and/or assessments for activities mandated by legal and/or other  administrative  requirements  (such  as  permits,  plans,  and  written  programs).  Information gathered by the monitoring activities supports HAF, AFCEC, and installation record keeping and performance reporting. For additional information, refer to the AF/A4C Portal and AFI 32-7047. Figure 7.1.  EMS Performance Monitoring Phase.  7.2.  ECAMP.  Installations  will  conduct  EMS  conformance  and  compliance  self-assessments, and track preventative/corrective actions, IAW DoDI 4715.17, DoDI 4715.06, AFI 90-201, AFI 90-801,  and  other  AF/A4C  and  AFCEC/CZ  guidance.  (T-0).  Latest  AFCEC/CZ  playbook environmental inspection guidance, with detailed procedures, is available on the AF CE Portal:   https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/ceportal/CEPlaybooks/Pages/default.aspx. 7.2.1.  Each installation shall conduct their respective internal self-assessment IAW with the Wing  Commander’s  Inspection  Program  (CCIP)  and  by  completing  checklists  in  the  IG’s Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT) and those prescribed by AFCEC/CZ. (T-1). 7.2.2.  The Environmental external self-assessment is integrated with the UEI IAW AFI 90-201  and  is  not  primarily  focused  on  detecting  non-compliance;  rather,  the  UEI  should  be used  to  conduct  the  external  EMS  audit  and  validate  and  verify  the  commander’s  own compliance detection program, identifying areas for the Wing Commander where he/she has significant  risk  of  undetected  non-compliance.  Environmental  Functional  Inspectors  must take  WENV  350,  EMS  Auditing  Course,  or  have  prior  auditing  experience  prior  to participating  in  their  first  UEI/Environmental  assessment.  (T-1).  Inspectors  must  have training  documented,  and  records  and/or  proof  of  auditing  experience,  forwarded  to AFCEC/CZ prior to participating in an external inspection. (T-1). AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 47 7.2.3.  The  IEF  (AFCEC  or  NGB/A7AN)  will  assist  installations  in  development  and execution of Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) for ESOHC review and approval IAW AFI 90-201. (T-1). 7.2.4.  Installation  ESOHCs  shall  review  installation  trends  and  track  the  progress  of  the implementation of corrective/preventive actions using the eDASH Finding Tracker tool. (T-1).  The  installation  ESOHC  shall  advocate  for  resources  and  help  create  justification  for funding requirements to close findings. (T-1). 7.2.5.  AFCEC  will  update  and  maintain  eDASH  dashboards,  conduct  trend  analysis,  and assist installations with tracking findings to closure, and verifying closure actions. (T-1). 7.3.  EMS Conformance.  The Installation Commander or ESOHC Chair must formally declare conformance to DoDI 4715.17 and AF EMS requirements, after an external EMS audit has been conducted and major non-conformances have been corrected. Reference  the EMS playbook  for details. (T-0). 7.4.  Monitoring and Measurement. 7.4.1.  The  installation  CFT  shall  supplement  AFCEC  procedures  to  regularly  monitor  and measure  the  key  characteristics  of  its  operations  that  can  have  a  significant  environmental impact. (T-1). 7.4.2.  Installations  shall  track  operational  performance  using  established  DoD,  HAF,  and AFCEC-level  performance  measures  and  data  calls.  (T-1).  Installations  shall  also  develop their own installation-specific performance measures designed to achieve installation unique objectives  and  targets.  (T-1).  By  incorporating  these  performance  measures  into  the  EAPs and  ensuring  their  inclusion  in  the  management  reviews,  organizations  can  focus  priority actions on those areas critical for improved performance. 7.4.3.  Installation  organizations  shall  ensure  that  calibrated  or  verified  compliance monitoring and measurement equipment is used and maintained IAW AFI 21-113, Air Force Metrology, and Calibration (AFMETCAL) Management, and retain associated records. (T-1). Installations must document the location of equipment  maintenance records in  eDASH.  (T-1).  Installations  must  maintain,  verify,  and  calibrate  monitoring  and  measuring  equipment that  does  not  fall  under  the  purview  of  AFI  21-113.  (T-1).  The  installation  should  have  an inventory of all monitoring and measuring equipment. 7.5.  Corrective and Preventive Action.  Installations shall implement, track, and appropriately address corrective and preventive actions for all inspection findings IAW DoDI 4715.06, DoDI 4715.17, AFI 90-201, and AFI 32-7047. (T-0). 7.6.  Legal  Compliance Tracking and Reporting.  AF installations shall track and report non-compliance  with  applicable  federal,  state,  local,  DoD,  and  AF,  environmental  laws  and regulations IAW AFI 32-7047. (T-0). 48 AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 Chapter 8 MANAGEMENT REVIEW AND CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT 8.1.  Overview.  The  Management  Review  is  part  of  the  Act  Phase  of  the  EMS.

A4-EM—The generic term describing the MAJCOM A4 WSs environmental management office or point of contact (POC). Each MAJCOM may have such a person or office established to work WS  environmental  issues  and  interact  with  the  AFMC  or  joint  service  WS  program offices/system  groups  or  the  EMS  responsible  for  each  AF  or  DoD  WS.  The  installation  WS ESOH  indicators  and  candidate  process  information  are  gathered  by  the  organization  UECs  or the  installation  WS  UEC  and  forwarded  through  their  ESOHC  to  the  MAJCOM  A4-EM offices/POC  for  WS  acquisition  issues  and  then  on  to  the  ESOH  POC  for  each  WS  and  their single manager. Activity  Management  Plans  (AMP)—Plans the  CE  business  processes, requirements,  and  risk  management  for  providing  facilities,  utilities,  transportation,  waste management, and NI. AMPs follow a structure that includes standardized level of services, key performance indicators, environmental compliance, programming, and training requirements. that  define Appropriate  Facility—Any  facility  subject  to  compliance  with  environmental  regulation  or conducts  activities  that  can  have  an  impact  on  the  environment,  either  directly  or  indirectly, individually  or  cumulatively,  due  to  the  operations  of  the  facility’s  or  organization’s  mission, processes or functions. Asset  Management  (AM)—Use of systematic  and integrated processes to  manage natural  and built  assets  and  their  associated  performance,  risk,  and  expenditures  over  their  life  cycles  to support missions and organizational goals. Capability—The attributes required to achieve operational effectiveness through a combination of regulatory compliance, management system conformance, and asset capacity. Capacity—The ability of NI and workforce assets to meet operational requirements. Assets that lack sufficient capacity are thought to be resource deficiencies and subject to denial of use, while assets with excess capacity are considered to provide resource opportunities. Conformance—The measure of EMS’s correspondence with PE of the ISO 14001 standard and those  requirements  established  by  HAF  and  supplemented  by  MAJCOMs  and/or  the implementing organization. Contingency Location—A non-enduring location outside of the U.S. that supports and sustains operations  during  named  and  unnamed  contingencies  or  other  operations  as  directed  by appropriate authority and is categorized by mission life-cycle requirements as initial, temporary, or semi-permanent. For more information, see DoDI 3000.10. Cross-Functional  Team  (CFT)—Group  of  SMEs  representing  key  organizations  to  include operations,  maintenance,  safety,  environment,  occupational  health,  transportation,  ranges,  and any others deemed critical for development and execution of ESOH initiatives. Typically, it also includes  military,  civilian,  and  contractor  personnel  from  all  levels  of  the  organizations.  A deputy  group  commander or higher will chair the team.  He or she may  wish  to  contact  facility tenants, non-AF entities, and other units to serve on the CFT. The team is given broad objectives, but not specific directives. Decision-making within the team is usually based on consensus. CFT  Chair  (Management  Representative)—No  lower  than  a  deputy  group  commander.  The CFT Chair is the specific management representative who, irrespective of other responsibilities, shall have the responsibilities and authority for ensuring that EMS requirements are developed, AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 59 implemented, and maintained; and will provide reporting to the ESOHC on the performance of the EMS, including recommendations for improvement. DoD Component—A Military Department, Service, Agency or other organization entity within the DoD. Environmental  Management  System  (EMS)—An  EMS  is  a  systemic  approach  to  handling environmental issues within an organization. The AF EMS is based on the ISO 14001 standard. It  provides  a  continual  cycle  of  planning,  implementing,  reviewing,  and  improving  the  process and  actions  that  an  organization  undertakes  to  identify  and  correct  deficiencies  and  improve environmental (and overall) performance. EMS  Coordinator—Provides  day-to-day  support  to  the  CFT  and  the  CFT  Chair.  The  EMS Coordinator  functions  as  the  recorder  for  the  CFT  and  works  with  the  CFT  to  ensure  EMS requirements  are  developed,  implemented,  and  maintained;  and  reported  to  the  ESOHC  on  the performance  of  the  EMS,  including  recommendations  for  improvement.  The  EMS  Coordinator shall be an Environmental Program Manager. Encroachment—Degradation  and/or  denial  of  access  to  a  resource  caused  by  competition  for that resource. Enduring Location—A physical area a DoD Component currently maintains and uses now that DoD intends to maintain access and use of for the foreseeable future. Enduring locations include main  operating  bases,  forward  operating  sites,  and  cooperative  security  locations.  For  more information, see DoDI 4715.05 and DoDI 4715.08. Environmental  Action  Plan  (EAP)—A  comprehensive  plan  developed  under  the  installation EMS  or  developed  at  the  EMS  organizational  or  programmatic  level  to  achieve  specified objectives and targets to address EMS significant aspects, environmental encroachment issues, or other DoD/AF priorities. The EAP will contain VOTs, and document action items or tasks (with performance measures) to meet or exceed those objectives and targets. Environmental  Aspect—An  element  of  a  facility’s  activities,  products,  or  services  that  can interact  with  the  environment  (i.e.,  creates  the  possibility  for  an  environmental  impact).  An aspect  can  be  thought  of  as  the  “cause”  of  an  environmental  impact  but  does  not  necessarily result in an environmental impact. Environmental  Compliance,  Assessment,  and  Management  Program  (ECAMP)—In response to E.O. 12088, Federal Compliance and Pollution Control Standards, the AF designed the  ECAMP  to  assist  AF  installations  and  organizations  in  complying  with  all  applicable regulatory  standards.  ECAMPs  include  all  major  and  minor  installations  (including  tenant organizations  on  and  off  the  installation),  support  sites  with  one  or  more  permits  from environmental  regulatory  agencies  (federal,  state,  local,  DoD,  or  AF),  and  GOCO  facilities. ECAMP has recently transformed under the AF Inspection System IAW AFI 90-201, and must now  conform  to  the  IG  Inspection  process  at  all  levels,  including  the  Commander’s  Inspection program (linked to Stage 2) and external Unit Effectiveness Inspection process (linked to Stage 3).  The  latest  ECAMP  is  evolving  into  a  subset  of  the  IG  inspection  process  to  help  HAF, MAJCOMs, and commanders assess the status of their EMSs, and to identify and track solutions to  environmental  problems,  and  is  comprised  of  the  Environmental  Self-Assessment  process managed by AFCEC/CZ. 60 AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 Environmental  Health—The  discipline  concerned  with  identifying  and  preventing  illness  and injury  due  to  exposure  to  hazardous  chemical,  physical,  and  biological  agents  that  may  be encountered  in  the  ambient  environment  –  air,  water,  or  soil  at  in-garrison  and  deployed locations. Environmental Impact—Any change to the environment, whether adverse or beneficial, wholly or  partially  resulting  from  an  organization’s  activities,  products,  or  services.  An  impact  can  be thought  of  as  an  “effect”  or  “outcome”  of  an  environmental  aspect.  A  potential  environmental impact is characterized by its probability and consequence. Impacts can be positive or negative. Environmental  Liaison  Officer  (ELO)—An  environmental  law  action  officer  assigned  to AFLOA/JACE-FSC.  The  ELO  is  embedded  with  MAJCOM  legal  offices  and  assists  the MAJCOM/SJA by communicating priorities and objectives to the FSC.

Environmental  Quality  (EQ)—The combination of three traditional environmental pillars that need  to  be  managed  to  ensure  the  protection  of  the  NI  and  compliance  with  environmental regulations. These encompass the program elements of compliance, conservation, and P2. Environmentally Preferable—Products or services having a lesser or reduced effect on human health  and  the  environment  when  compared  with  competing  products  or  services  serving  the same  purpose.  This  comparison  may  consider  raw  materials  acquisition,  production, manufacturing,  packaging,  distribution,  reuse,  operation,  maintenance,  or  product  or  service disposal. Final  Governing  Standards  (FGS)—A  set  of  country-specific  substantive  provisions  (not procedural), typically technical limitations on effluent, discharges, etc. or a specific management practice. Foreign  Country—Any  land,  water,  or  airspace  that  is  subject  to  competent  exercise  of jurisdiction  by  one  or  more  foreign  governments  or  international  organizations;  a  nation, territory, or geographic area that is outside the customs territories of the U.S.. Government-Owned,  Contractor-Operated  (GOCO)—A  facility  that  is  owned  by  the Government and operated under contract by a non-government, private firm. Hazard—Any  real  or  potential  condition  that  can  cause  injury,  illness,  or  death  to  personnel; damage to or loss of a system, equipment, or property; or damage to the environment. Host Nation—A nation other than the U.S. that receives the force or supplies of allied nations or North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO)  organizations,  the  former  force  or  supplies  to  be located on, to operate in, or to transit through its territories. Installation—An  enduring  location  consisting  of  a  base,  camp,  post,  station,  yard,  center,  or other DoD activity under the operational control of the Secretary of a Military Department or the Secretary of Defense. For more information, see DoDI 4715.05 and DoDI 4715.08. Intermediate Environmental Function (IEF)—The environmental function at the intermediate level between the installation civil engineer and AFCEC or HAF. The IEF facilitates information exchange,  provides  consultation,  and  executes  environmental  actions  on  behalf  of  HAF  or AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 61 AFCEC (primarily AFCEC). For active-duty and reserve AF installations located in the U.S. and U.S.  territories,  this  is  the  AFCEC/CZ  IST.  For  installations  located  overseas,  it  is  the AFCEC/CF  Europe  and  Pacific  Divisions  (Environmental  Branches).  The  IEF  for  ANG installations, on behalf of the National Guard Bureau, is the NGB/A7AN. International Agreement—A multilateral or bilateral agreement, such as an installation’s rights or access agreement, a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), or any other instrument defined as a binding international agreement under DoDD 5530.3, International Agreements. Lead Environmental Component (LEC)—The Secretary of a Military Department, Combatant Commander, or Sub-unified Commander specifically designated by the Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense  for  Installations  and  Environment  (DUSD(I&E)).in  this  instruction  to  execute  the responsibilities  prescribed  in  DoDI  4715.05,  Enclosure  2,  for  environmental  matters  associated with DoD installations in specific foreign countries. Management  Review—A process  used to evaluate the suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the EMS. Used to identify  and assess opportunities to  change an organization’s EMS policy and objectives, to address resource needs, and to look for opportunities to improve its products. Mishap—An unplanned event or series of events resulting in death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. Natural  Infrastructure  (NI)—Assets  (air,  water,  land,  and  frequency  spectrum)  evaluated during a Natural Infrastructure Assessment, which are resources necessary to support current and future operational requirements. Operational  Risk  Management  (ORM)—The  systematic  process  of  identifying  hazards, assessing  risk,  analyzing  risk  control  options  and  measures,  making  control  decisions, implementing control decisions, formally accepting residual risks, and supervising/reviewing the activity for effectiveness. Reference MIL-STD-882D, Department of Defense Standard Practice for  System  Safety,  and  DoDD  5000.01,  The  Defense  Acquisition  System,  for  appropriate guidance. Organizational-level EMS—A EMS that contains only those elements that are necessary for the organization to carry out certain necessary functions for setting and transmitting objectives and targets  to  lower  units  and  for  collecting,  packaging  and  reporting  on  accomplishments  and compliance. It will seldom contain all the elements of an ISO 14001-conforming EMS. It is also not necessary that each of the elements conform to the ISO 14001 specifications. In recognition of  this,  the  OFEE  has  exempted  organizational-level  EMSs  from  the  federal  requirement  for periodic  Declaration  of  Conformance.  Only  facility-level  EMSs  (including  multi-site  EMSs) must  continue  to  comply  with  that  requirement.  (See  reference  guidance  on  ‘higher-tier  EMS’ issued  by  the  OFEE  on  31  October,  2008:  Guidance  on  Implementing  Environmental Management Systems “At All Appropriate Organizational Levels”)  Overseas—A  nation,  territory,  or  geographic  area  that  is  outside  the  customs  territories  of  the U.S., a foreign country or territory. Overseas  Environmental  Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD)—The OEBGD is a set of objective criteria and management practices developed by the DoD, pursuant to DoDI 4715.05. It specifies the minimum criteria for environmental compliance at permanent DoD installations at overseas locations where no FGS have been established. It is designed to protect human health 62 AFI32-7001  16 APRIL 2015 and  safety  and  reflects  generally  accepted  environmental  standards  applicable  to  DoD installations  and  activities  in  foreign  countries.  The  OEBGD  is  used  to  develop  and  update country-specific FGS for all DoD components located in that host nation. Overseas  Installation—A  facility  or  group  of  facilities  at  a  fixed  geographical  location  under the  control  of  a  DoD  component,  and  other  facilities  designated  by  a  Unified  Combatant Commander, base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary  of  a  Military  Department  that  is  located  outside  the  U.S.  and  outside  any  territory, commonwealth, or possession of the U.S. Planning  Readiness—Installation  readiness  to  support  new  mission  requirements.  Can  be facilitated or supported by the installation level EMS, provide awareness of the status of baseline planning  elements  and  overall  readiness  of  programs,  and  incorporated  into  the  EIAP  and/or other  decision-making  processes.  Measures  the  degree  to  which  basic  planning  requirements, including  installation  environmental  planning  elements  and  sustainability  indicators,  are  being met  in  order  to  assist  in  aligning  resources  to  high-risk  areas  for  investment  (e.g.,  long  lead items). Enables early NEPA risk reduction planning to  include meeting  aggressive  goals  for 6-month  Environmental  Assessments  (EAs)  and  12-month  Environmental  Impact  Statements (EISs), which are possible when accompanied with sound proponent proposals. Pollution  Prevention  (P2)—Source  reduction  and  other  practices  that  reduce  or  eliminate  the amount  of  hazardous  substances,  pollutants,  or  contaminants  entering  the  waste  stream  or otherwise released into the environment prior to  recycling, treatment, and disposal; reduces the hazards  to  public  health  and  the  environment  associated  with  the  release  of  such  substances, pollutants, or contaminants; and, increases efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water, or other resources; or protection of natural resources by conservation. Regional  Counsel  (RC)—A  part  of  AFLOA/JACE  imbedded  with  the  AFCEC/RO  and responsible  for  providing  environmental  law  support  to  installations,  AFCEC,  MAJCOMs,  and the REO. Risk—An  expression  of  the  impact  and  possibility  of  a  mishap  in  terms  of  potential  mishap severity and probability of occurrence. Significant  Aspect—An environmental aspect that has or can have a significant environmental impact. The significance of impacts is determined by the application of significance criteria. An aspect  is  either  significant  or  it  is  not  significant,  there  is  no  significance  gradations  and  no aspect is more or less significant than another aspect. However, once selected, all the significant aspects  can  be  ranked  either  explicitly,  by  listing  them  in  order  of  priority,  or  implicitly  by varying  the  resources  and  timeframes  allocated  to  the  achievement  of  objectives  and  targets  in the EAPs. Site—Any single parcel of land, regardless of size, used and maintained by a DoD Component. Subject Matter Expert (SME)—An expert in EMS subject matter, usually located at AFCEC.
