Johns, Jr.)Pages: 15The Air Force (AF) employs many diverse weapon systems in executing its global mission. Operating,maintaining, and modifying these systems to upgrade or extend economical service life greatly consumesthe AF’s budget. Ultimately, the AF must develop, purchase, and field new systems to replace obsoletesystems or systems beyond economical repair. The Chief of Staff, United States Air Force (CSAF), or authorized representative, will designate systemsas weapon systems and assign each to a lead command. This AF Policy Directive (AFPD) assigns weaponsystem management responsibilities to designated lead commands to ensure all requirements associatedwith weapon systems receive comprehensive and equitable consideration, and program-associated fund-ing through the Future Years Defense Program as necessary. Lead command designation establishes advocacy for weapon systems during their life cycle and clarifiesresponsibilities for all using and supporting organizations. The designated lead command provides a pri-mary input into the process of developing and maintaining a force structure with a balance of complemen-tary capabilities. Lead command designation is not exclusive to major commands (MAJCOMs); FieldOperating Agencies (FOAs) and Direct Reporting Unites (DRUs) may also be designated. This AFPD establishes a basis for rational allocation of scarce resources among competing requirements.It designates a lead command when Regular AF (RegAF) MAJCOMs or agencies “share” a systemamong themselves, with units of the Air Reserve Component (ARC), or with other Services, and whenonly one AF MAJCOM or FOA/DRU possesses the weapon system. It also designates all other MAJ-COMs or FOAs/DRUs possessing that weapon system as “using” commands. All MAJCOMs, FOAs/DRUs, and the ARC must support the AF’s effort to maintain configuration con-trol, commonality, and capability synchronization for interoperability within total force operations. Leadcommands for systems operated by RegAF MAJCOMs, FOAs/DRUs, and the ARC must prioritize vali-dated requirements, resources, and schedules within a total force context. Proactive and thorough commu-nication between lead commands and using commands is paramount in support of these valuable weaponsystems. 2AFPD10-9   8 MARCH 2007This directive establishes AF policy and applies to all RegAF or ARC MAJCOMs, DRUs, and FOAs whoexercise either lead command or using command responsibilities for AF weapon systems. Refer recom-mended changes and conflicts between this and other publications to HQ AF/A8PE, 1070 Air Force Pen-tagon, Washington DC 20330-1070, on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained inaccordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and dis-posed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/. SUMMARY OF CHANGESThis document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes include:Changed AFPD name to reflect scope and purpose. Provided updated clarification of lead command andusing command responsibilities. Deleted distinction between “lead command” and “lead agency,” unlessotherwise noted, by allowing a lead command to be either a MAJCOM or FOA/DRU. Deleted Attach-ment 1 from the previous AFPD version, as AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, no longerrequires measuring compliance with policy directives. Added a Glossary of References and SupportingInformation at Attachment 1. Updated Attachment 2, Lead Command Assignments for Aircraft MissionDesign Series (MDS) Weapon Systems. Deleted Attachment 3 and 4, interim changes, from the previousAFPD version. Added a new Attachment 3, Lead Command Assignments for Non-aircraft Weapon Sys-tems. 1.  This AFPD establishes the following authorities and responsibilities for weapon system lead com-mands. Inherent in lead command responsibility is also the responsibility for support systems and equip-ment directly associated with a particular weapon system. The lead command will: 1.1.  Advocate for the weapon system and respond to issues addressing its status and use. Advocacyincludes capabilities-based planning, programming, and budgeting for designated system-wide uniqueequipment, upgrades/modifications, initial spares and other weapon system-unique logistics issues,and follow-on test and evaluation. In addition, for advocacy issues identified above, perform and man-age modernization and sustainment planning across MAJCOMs and agencies, and in coordinationwith system program managers (SPMs) and Headquarters AF (HAF) functional offices. 1.2.  AF Materiel Command (AFMC) is designated as the AF Centralized Asset Management (CAM)Executive Agent (EA). Lead commands will advocate for the sustainment of weapon systems andsupport AFMC to ensure all requirements associated with weapon system sustainment receive equita-ble consideration in AFMC's programming, budgeting and execution of resources to establish depotcapabilities and sustain weapon systems under CAM. 1.2.1.  Non-AFMC managed programs (i.e. space systems sustained by Space and Missile Centerand Electronic System Command) are exempt from CAM; AF Space Command (AFSPC) willadvocate for the sustainment of these systems. 1.3.  If organizationally aligned as a FOA under a HAF Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS), prepare a Pro-gram Objective Memorandum (POM) and submit it to the appropriate DCS for review and approval.After approval, the FOA will submit its POM input to the AF Corporate Structure in accordance withAnnual Planning and Programming Guidance and POM Planning Instructions. AFPD10-9   8 MARCH 200731.4.  Provide appropriate operational and support agency representation in the requirements and/orupgrade/modification process. 1.5.  Follow established directives when establishing and prioritizing upgrade/modification require-ments. 1.6.  Identify Minimum Essential Systems Listing items. If necessary, using commands can supple-ment with their own specific requirements. 1.7.  Oversee weapon system configuration following established MAJCOM and weapon systemSPM procedures. The weapon system SPM is responsible for maintaining system engineering integ-rity to include planning to establish and maintain configuration control and interoperability. The leadcommand is responsible for fleet-wide interoperability, commonality, and configuration control.Therefore, both the lead command and the SPM must first approve any implementation of permanentmodification for which there was no previous validated need. 1.8.  Establish standards, tasks, and formal training requirements for both operations and maintenance(O&M). For AF Special Operations Command, provisions of USAF or US Special Operations Com-mand Memoranda of Agreement apply. 1.9.  Manage munitions test and training requirements in accordance with AFI 36-2217, MunitionsRequirements for Aircrew Training, for each weapon system they are designated lead command.Establish and prioritize weapon systems and aircraft integration efforts in accordance with AF SEEKEAGLE initiatives. 1.10.  Establish minimum Readiness Spares Package standards. Using commands can supplementwith their own specific requirements, if necessary. 1.11.  Author weapon system-specific AF Instructions (AFIs) or AF Joint Instructions and/or AF/Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) in accordance with applicable AF, Depart-ment of Defense (DoD), and Joint policy documents, for each weapon system they are designated leadcommand. 1.12.  Follow established US Government and DoD policy guidelines requiring adherence to interna-tional, multinational, and bilateral agreements (including arms control agreements and regimes),arrangements, custom, and practice. 1.13.  Execute the following responsibilities with respect to weapon system fielding: 1.13.1.  Define and document fielding requirements for execution by the SPM. 1.13.2.  Develop and execute appropriate programming plans that document MAJCOM responsi-bilities in fielding execution. 1.13.3.  Upon initiation by the System Program Office and in conjunction with the SPM, develop,sign and distribute Expectation Management Agreements (EMAs) that detail the desired sustain-ment capability of, and modification plans for weapon systems. The EMAs also delineate leadcommand and using MAJCOM responsibilities, to include AFMC and using MAJCOMs, AirEducation and Training Command (AETC), and wing commanders at field locations, in accor-dance with AFI 63-101, Operations of Capabilities Based Acquisition System. 1.13.4.  Maintain and distribute a point of contact list of stakeholders for every fielding effort tofacilitate coordination and communication with the SPM and the gaining unit(s). 4AFPD10-9   8 MARCH 20071.13.5.  Charter a General Officer Steering Group when deemed appropriate, for new weapon sys-tem beddown. 1.13.6.  Support AFMC and represent the using commands during the requirements review pro-cesses. Lead commands will coordinate and consolidate programmatic inputs (e.g. force structure,basing, usage changes, etc.) with using commands to ensure this information is available and inte-grated into the requirements review processes. 2.  Using commands will advocate for their sustainment requirements through the lead command in sup-port of AFMC’s planning, programming, budgeting, and execution responsibilities under CAM. Usingcommands will coordinate with AFMC for command-unique items. 2.1.  Using commands will comply with AFIs for applicable weapon systems. Using commands maypublish command supplements as needed to address mission-unique requirements. 2.1.1.  Using command supplements, when required for unique mission considerations, may notbe less restrictive than the published AFI. 2.2.  Modifications driven by using commands or unique mission requirements for MDS hardware/software are the using commands’ programming responsibility. 2.2.1.  The lead command and the SPM must approve any modifications before they may becomepermanent. 3.  Lead commands, in conjunction with using commands, will define and document all new weapons sys-tem beddown requirements and coordinate these with the applicable SPM.  The lead command and usingcommands have the responsibility to program for all new weapon system requirements to include, but notlimited to, military construction, minor construction, training systems and equipment, appropriate envi-ronmental costs, and initial O&M costs. Previously programmed budget will transfer from losing to gain-ing command if beddown locations are subsequently changed. 3.1.  Lead commands in conjunction with using commands will develop and execute appropriate pro-gramming plans that document command responsibilities for new weapon system beddown.  Leadcommands and using commands will conduct Site Activation Task Forces (SATAFs), as deemedappropriate, to support beddown and the development of programming plans.  Lead commands willsupport using commands as they conduct their SATAFs and provide beddown lessons learned to usingcommands. 3.2.  Lead commands, in conjunction with using commands, will develop System Training Plans andcoordinate them with the SPM and AETC, in accordance with AFI 36-2251, Management of AirForce Training Systems. 3.3.  Lead commands will ensure appropriate National Environmental Protection Act activities areaccomplished before any major federal action is accomplished. 4.  The AF will centrally manage other fleet requirements using an “enterprise” approach. AFMC, actingas the EA for the AF, will centrally program, budget, and execute flying hour Depot Level Reparables,Depot Purchased Equipment Maintenance, Contractor Logistics Support, Technical Orders, SustainingEngineering, O&M funded support equipment, flying hour consumables, and Aviation Petroleum, Oil,and Lubricants. (AFSPC will accomplish these activities for space systems.) Lead Commands, in con-junction with user commands, will collaborate with AFMC to prioritize requirements on an annual basis. AFPD10-9   8 MARCH 200755.  Organizations not able to perform full lead command duties may negotiate transfer of certain functionsto MAJCOMs or agencies with more capability in those areas. Responsibilities will be delineated in theappropriate program management directive. 6.  This AFPD provides overarching policy covering a wide range of activities impacted by the lead com-mand concept. Cognizant agencies should develop implementation strategies and procedures tailored totheir particular activity. 7.  See Attachment 2 and Attachment 3 for lead command assignments. MICHAEL W.
