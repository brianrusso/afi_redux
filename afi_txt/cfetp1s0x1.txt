Career  Field Education and Training Plan. This  CFETP is  a  comprehensive  education and training  document  that  identifies  life-cycle  education/training  requirements,  training  support resources, and  minimum  core  task  requirements  for  this  specialty. The  CFETP  will  provide sa fet y  personnel  a  clear  career path to success and will instill vigor in all aspects of career field training. NOTE:  Civilians occupying occupational safety (SEG) positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training. 2. The CFETP  consists of  two  parts;  both  are used  by supervisors  to  plan,  manage,  and  control training within the career field. 2.1. Part  I provides  information  necessary for  overall  management  of  the  specialty.   Section  A  explains the purpose of the CFETP and how everyone will use the plan;  Section  B  identifies  career  field  progression  information,  duties  and  responsibilities,  training strategies, and career field path;  Section C associates each skill  level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, training, education, and  experience);   Section  D  indicates  resource  constraints  associated  with  formal  and  on-the-job  training  (OJT). Some  examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities.  Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for the ranks of SSgt through MSgt. NOTE: The Air Force Enlisted Classification  Directory contains the job descriptions. 2.2. Part II includes the following:   Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and  includes  duties,  tasks,  technical references (TRs)  to  support  training,  Air  Education  and  Training  Command (AETC) conducted training, core tasks, and correspondence course requirements.  Section B  contains the course objective list (COL) and training standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen  satisfied training requirements.  Section C identifies available support materials.  An example is a  Qualification Training Package (QTPs) which may be developed to support proficiency training.  These  packages  are  located  in www.e-publishing.af.mil.   Section  D  identifies  a  training  course  index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are  both mandatory and optional courses.  Section  E  identifies  MAJCOM  unique  training  requirements additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty  receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career.  This plan will enable us to train today’s supervisors  can  use  to  determine 1        work  force  for  tomorrow’s  jobs. At  the  unit  level,  supervisors  and  trainers  will  use  Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

Quality training  and  timely progression  from  the apprentice to  the superintendent  skill  level  plays  an  extremely  important  role  in  the  Air  Force’s  ability  to accomplish  its  mission. Everyone  involved  in  training  must  do  their  part  to  plan,  develop,  and manage  an  effective  training  program.  This  part  of  the  CFETP  provides  guidance  to  ensure individuals  receive  viable  training  at  appropriate  points  in  their  career.  The  following  narrative identifies an individual’s career training path and requirements. 5.1. Apprentice  (3) Level.  Initial skills training in this specialty consist of tasks and knowledge provided in the 3-skill level resident Occupational Safety Apprentice course (L3ALR1S031) located at JBSA-Lackland. This is a 30-day course that provide students with the skills and knowledge to perform the duties as identified in the STS, Part II of this CFETP. 5.2. Journeyman (5) Level. Journeyman will attend ALS after 48 months in the Air Force, or sooner, if selected for promotion to Staff Sergeant. After Airman Leadership School (ALS), journeymen can perform duties as trainers and supervisors and be considered for appointment as unit trainers. To enhance their skills, they are highly encouraged to continue their education toward a Community 7         College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree and to take certification examinations (see Section D – Training Course Index, Section 5). 5.3.  Craftsman  (7)  Level.  A Safety  craftsman  can  be  expected  to  fill various supervisory  and management positions such as Non-commissioned Officer-in-Charge (NCOIC). In addition, they may develop work and training schedules for subordinate personnel and ensure necessary manning levels are maintained at all times during hours of operation. The 7-levels should take the supervisor’s course at the earliest opportunity. Members are highly encouraged to continue their education toward CCAF degree and have a CHST, OHST, SMS, ASP or CSP certification (See Table 7.1. for certification descriptions).  5.4.  Superintendent  (9)  Level.  A  9-skill  level  can  be  expected  to  fill  positions  such  as Superintendent or various staff positions. Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower, resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing education. Completion of a CCAF degree is mandatory. Completion of additional degrees or certifications in safety is also encouraged. 6. Training  Decisions.  The  CFETP  uses  a  building  block  approach  (simple  to  complex)  to encompass  the  entire  spectrum  of  training  requirements  for  the  Safety career  field.  The  CFETP includes a strategy for  when, where,  and how  to meet these training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training. The  following  training  decisions  were  made  at  the  career  field Specialty Training Requirements  Team  (STRT)  and  Utilization  and  Training  Workshop  (U&TW)  held  at  JBSA Lackland TX, 6-10 June 2016. 6.1. Initial Skills Training: The Safety 101 course was removed as a pre-requisite to 3- level training to allow for the award of the 30-Hour General Industry completion certificate (requiring in-person instruction) upon completion of the 3-level course. 30-hour General Industry OSHA cards will be provided to graduating 3-level students. This program will be the responsibility of the 344 TRS to maintain (cards, trainer/trainee rosters, and required instructor education as appropriate).  6.2. Five-Skill Level Training: Core tasks were modified to emphasize job survey and commander requirements. The CDC volumes were expanded from four to five volumes. 6.3. Seven-Skill Level  Training: The Pre-Craftsman Safety Course (PCSC_L6ANW1S071 00AA, PDS Code 20V) was added as a knowledge gate for all 7-level course attendees. Course completion is  mandatory  prior  to  7-level  course  attendance.  STRT  participants  made  this  decision  as  many students were not properly prepared (through experience and knowledge) for the required material in the 7-level school curriculum. MINA was also added as a prerequisite for 7-level. As 7-levels should be competent safety managers, management lessons and materials were integrated into both the 7-level course and OJT. 6.4. Nine-Skill Level  Training: Upgrade to 9-skill level consists of the following: (1) Must be a SMSgt, (2) Qualified in all 5- and 7-level core tasks and (3) complete Safety Manager Course (WCIP 05D ).  6.5.  Chief  Enlisted  Manager  (CEM  1S000)  Training  Requirements.  The  individual  will  be awarded AFSC 1S000 when selected for Chief Master Sergeant.   8         6.6. Proficiency/Continuation Training. Proficiency training is critical to the development of the safety professional and the mission. The proficiency training program provides additional advanced training exceeding the minimum upgrade training requirements with the emphasis on present and future duty positions. Fulltime safety professionals must complete at least three safety-related continuing education units (CEU) per year. Refer to Part II, Section D, Training Course Index, of this CFETP for a listing of available supplementary training courses. Professional development does not cease once upgrade has been completed. Safety managers will ensure their OJT program complies with the requirements outlined in AFI  36-2201, On-the-Job Training Administration. 7.

The EDT outlines the training, education, and  experience  requirements  for  the  critical  Safety  management  duty  positions  and  provides recommendations  for  the  best  qualified  SNCOs  into  these  key  leadership  and  key  development positions across the Air Force. The EDT also identifies other developmental opportunities for the 1S0X1 SNCOs to facilitate their development. These recommendations or vectors are the EDT’s collective  recommendations  for  the  experience  level,  training  and/or  education  opportunity,  or position type that a member should be considered and seek out professional growth. Vectoring will consist of recommendations for identified positions (i.e. development and leadership positions) within Safety for which a member should be considered in subsequent assignments, but will not identify a specific location of assignment.  8.2. Enlisted Career Path. The following chart depicts a complete picture of education, training, and assignment positions through all 1S0XX skill levels.
