After initially deciding not  to  establish  a  UIF,  commanders  may  elect  to  establish  a  UIF  or  include  an  earlier administrative action in a previously established UIF if the date of the action or document is within  6  months  from  the  date  of  the  action.    This  does  not  apply  to  individuals  who  have reenlisted since the date of the document. AFI36-2907  26 NOVEMBER 2014   11  2.4.4.  See Table 2.2 for a list of documents that the UIF monitor must file. 2.5.  Removal of UIFs or their Documents. 2.5.1.  Commanders  maintain  the  UIF  and  all  of  its  documents/contents  until  the  final disposition  date  (Table  2.2)  unless  early  removal  of  the  document  or  UIF  is  clearly warranted.  Commanders initiate removal action via AF Form 1058 or memorandum, and the individual should acknowledge the action.  (T-2). 2.5.2.  UIF monitors: 2.5.2.1.  Remove UIFs (enlisted or officer) when you receive a record of action from the SJA showing that punishment under Article 15 was set aside or that a civilian conviction was overturned.  (T-2). 2.5.2.2.  Remove  UIFs  (enlisted  or  officer)  when  the  commander,  after  consulting  with the servicing SJA and reviewing the member’s rebuttal,  determines the member did  not commit the offense listed in the LOR, LOA or LOC.  (T-2). 2.5.2.3.  Remove UIFs (officer only) upon receipt of an AF Form 1058, or memorandum signed  by  the  officer’s  wing  commander  (or  equivalent),  imposing  or  issuing  authority, whichever  is  higher.    Courts-martial  and  Article  15  documents  may  be  removed  early only once the punishment is completed (see paragraph 2.5.5).  (T-2). 2.5.2.4.

Courts-martial  documents  may  be  removed  early  only once the punishment is completed (see paragraph 2.5.5).  (T-2). 2.5.2.5.  All other UIF entries may be removed early regardless of how long the UIF was on  file  in  the  system  by  the  wing  commander  (or  equivalent)  or  issuing  authority, whichever  is  higher  for  officers  and  by  the  unit  commander  or  higher  for  enlisted members (See paragraph 2.5.5). 2.5.2.6.  The wing commander (or equivalent), imposing or issuing authority, whichever is higher, may direct removal of derogatory data from the OSR at any time; or the officer may  appeal  to  have  the  derogatory  data  removed  after  one  In  the  Promotion  Zone  or Above  the  Promotion  Zone  consideration.    (See  AFI  36-2608,  Military  Personnel Records System).  Removing an officer’s UIF early does not remove the derogatory data (if filed) from the OSR.  (T-3). 2.5.2.6.1.  The MAJCOM/FOA Records Custodian removes the documents  from  the Officer Command Selection Record Group upon receipt of their copy of the approved early removal decision memorandum and destroys all related documents.

Unexpired UIFs are transferred between  the  RegAF,  ANG,  and  AFR  components  on  all  personnel  (officer  and  enlisted) separating  or  transferring  between  the  RegAF,  AFR  or  ANG  member.    This  includes  the transfer of unexpired UIFs within the AFR components for officer and enlisted members. AFI36-2907  26 NOVEMBER 2014   13  2.6.2.  For TDY en route PCS.  The TDY commander sends a completed copy of AF Forms 1058  and  1137  and  the  individual's  PCS  special  orders  to  the  gaining  MPS  after  each  UIF entry.  If the individual's eligibility or suitability for the pending assignment is in doubt, the gaining commander contacts the MPS for guidance.  (T-2).  If the individual is TDY and will return  to  their  permanent  unit,  the  TDY  commander  sends  the  completed  package  to  the individual's unit commander.  (T-2). 2.6.3.  If the individual is absent without leave (AWOL) or in deserter status before or on the UIF  expiration  date,  the  unit  commander  notifies  the  UIF  monitor  in  writing  of  the individual’s status.  The notification letter serves as a source document for the PDS update.  The  UIF  monitor  retains  the  UIF  and  updates  the  UIF  disposition  date  to  "8  Aug  3888" (indefinite).    Do  not  annotate  the  AF  Form  1137  (see  Table  2.3).    (T-1).    If  the  individual returns  from  AWOL  or  deserter  status,  the  unit  commander  advises  the  UIF  monitor  to destroy  the  UIF  or  establishes  a  new  UIF  disposition  date.    This  date  is  no  more  than  3 months from the date the commander signs the UIF notice advising the UIF monitor of the member's change in status.  If a document is added to the UIF before the end of the 3 months, the UIF disposition date is extended.  If a document is not added, the UIF is destroyed at the end of the 3 months (see Table 2.3).  (T-1). 2.6.4.  The UIF monitor maintains the UIF for members in dropped-from-rolls status.  When the  UIF  expires,  the  monitor  annotates  the  AF  Form  1137  to  show  the  date  the  member entered  dropped-from-rolls  status,  has  it  signed  by  the  commander,  and  forwards  it  to  the MPS, Personnel Employment Element.  If returned to duty at a later date the unit commander advises the UIF monitor to destroy the UIF or establishes a new UIF disposition date.  This date is  no more than 3  months from  the date the commander signs the  UIF notice advising the UIF monitor of the member’s change in status.  If a document is added to the UIF before the end of the 3 months, the UIF disposition date is extended.  If a document is not added, the UIF is destroyed at the end of the 3 months (see Table 2.3).  (T-1). 2.7.  Updating UIF Documents (see Adverse Actions PDS Guide). 2.7.1.  The UIF Monitor. Once documents  are received from the commander or appropriate staff agencies, the UIF monitor updates UIF actions in PDS in a timely manner. 2.7.2.  The Military Personnel Section: 2.7.2.1.  Forwards  executed  grade  reductions  (demotion  order  or  AF  Form  3070)  to  the Customer Support Element. 2.7.2.2.

As  a  minimum,  review  all  unit  UIFs  within  90  days  of  their  permanent assumption  or  appointment  to  command.  Unit  commanders  and  SJA  must  review  UIFs annually.    UIF  monitors  provide  the  commander  and  SJA  an  automated  listing  of  all UIFs.    The  commanders  will  compare  the  listing  to  the  actual  documents  in  the  UIF folder to ensure database integrity.  Document the review via a memorandum signed by the unit commander and SJA.  Geographically Separated Unit (GSU) commanders use a computer  listing  of  UIFs  to  acknowledge  existence  of  UIFs.    After  the  review  is complete,  the  GSU  commander  signs  the  list  and  files  it  in  the  general  correspondence file.  (T-3). 2.9.1.2.

The CEMR and the COMR  are monthly listings of personnel assigned within the unit possessing a quality indicator (UIF, control roster, Article 15, etc.).  The CEMR  also  lists  personnel  possessing  EPR  ratings  which  might  indicate  close  observation  of their performance is appropriate.  No certification or suspense of either roster is required.  They are simply management tools designed to give commanders an "at a glance" look at personnel in their organization with quality indicators.  All entries should be reviewed by the commander and FSS staff to ensure appropriate action was taken.  This includes determining the appropriateness of an upcoming promotion, qualification for PRP duties, assignment, reenlistment, etc., some of which are identified under the "projected for" area.  The rosters are retrieved from the unit and provided to the commander for review.  (T-1). 2.11.  Making  Recommendations  to  the  Commander.

Also applies to Article 15 punishment imposed on an Air Force member of a joint command by a commander of a different service when processed in accordance with AFI 51-202.  Includes any suspended punishment longer than a month (31 days or more).  Less than a month equals 30 days or less.  AFRC, ARPC or TAG may establish longer observation periods, not to exceed 12 months for AFR or ANG personnel, if deemed appropriate.  2.  The servicing SJA specifies in writing whether the action is mandatory or optional for file in the UIF.  The determination accompanies the record of court action (conviction or judgment) or is written and signed on the record itself.  If mandatory for file, the SJA sends the record and determination directly to the UIF monitor with a copy to the member’s commander for action.  3.  PCS plus 1 year is determined by adding 1 year to the individual’s Date Arrive Station.  If individual’s UIF is due to expire prior to the individual departing PCS, extend the UIF (do not let it expire) for 1 year from Report Not Later Than Date (RNLTD).  The gaining UIF monitor makes appropriate PDS adjustments when the individual’s record is gained to file.  For Reservist, extend the UIF (do not let it expire) for 1 year from the effective date change strength accountability, the   20  AFI36-2907  26 NOVEMBER 2014 date the Reservist changes assignment.  For RegAF officers that will separate or transfer to the AFRC, do not let the UIF expire.  Extend the disposition date to reflect 2 yrs or separation or transfer date plus one year, whichever is later.  4.  AFRC, ARPC or TAG may establish longer observation periods, not to exceed 12 months for AFR or ANG personnel, if deemed appropriate.  5.  If the Article 15 punishment is a Letter of Reprimand only, then the update of UIF code 1 with a 2 year disposition date is appropriate.  6.  If there is more than 14 days between the date the commander signed the AF Form 1058 and the date of the LOR, annotate the discrepancy in a Memorandum for Record (MFR) and use the date of the LOR/LOA/LOC when determining the disposition date.

This is an AF Form 1137 annotation only.  You do not have to maintain documentation in the UIF.  2.  The PDS generates a transmittal notice for the AF Form 1137 before the RNLTD, when a member's end assignment changes, and on short-notice assignments if the member is within 120 days of RNLTD.  When a member's end assignment changes or is canceled, the PDS generates a Transaction Register (TR) remark, and the gaining unit destroys the advance copies of the AF Form 1137.  3.  Keep a copy of the advance transmittal notice in the UIF folder until mailed.  Destroy it afterwards.  4.  If the member is projected for a PRP position, coordinate UIFs on gains with the unit PRP AFI36-2907  26 NOVEMBER 2014   25  monitor.  5.  File retained transmittal notices in the general correspondence file.  6.  Before sending the UIF electronically (encrypted), ensure its contents are complete and accurately recorded.  Sign and date the AF Form 1137 (reviewer’s remarks, signature, date), certifying that you have reviewed it.  Do not send electronically until you receive PDS confirmation.    7.  The PDS produces a notice once it confirms a member's reassignment.  Remove the pencil entries on the AF Form 1137 before scanning and sending the UIF to the new unit.  8.  When a member enters or returns from dropped-from-the-rolls status, code or decode the UIF disposition.  9.  To determine the member's status, consult the worldwide personnel listing, MPS in-processing clerk, Personnel Employment, or the losing Adverse Actions office.  10. Upon receipt, before giving an UIF to the FSS, RIO or ARPC/DPAMR, the UIF monitor:  10.1.  Signs and dates the AF Form 1137 (reviewer's remarks, signature, date), certifying he or she reviewed it.  10.2.  For a member reassigned as a prisoner (confinement) with or without discharge because of a court-martial conviction, records the court-martial conviction on AF Form 1137 and includes it in the UIF before forwarding the UIF to the Personnel Employment Element.  10.3.  Delays forwarding and takes timely follow-up action pending receipt of the court-martial conviction and then gives Personnel Employment the UIF for placement in the Field Personnel Record Group (FPRG).  11.  Does not apply to the Air Force Reserve.    26  AFI36-2907  26 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 3 CONTROL ROSTER 3.1.  Who Uses  the Control  Roster.  The control roster is a rehabilitative tool for commanders to  use.    Commanders  use  the  control  roster  to  establish  a  6-month  observation  period  (AFRC, ARPC, RIO, or the TAG may establish longer observation periods, not to exceed 12 months, for AFR  and  ANG  personnel,  if  deemed  appropriate)  for  individuals  whose  duty  performance  is substandard  or  who  fail  to  meet  or  maintain  Air  Force  standards  of  conduct,  bearing,  and integrity, on or off duty. 3.2.  When to use a Control Roster.  A brief incident of substandard performance or an isolated breach  of  standards,  not  likely  to  be  repeated,  should  not  usually  result  in  an  individual's placement on the control roster.  Consideration should be given to prior incidents, acts, failures, counseling  and  rehabilitative  efforts.    Commanders  inform  members  on  the  control  roster  their performance and behavior must improve or they will face more severe administrative action or punishment. 3.2.1.  Commanders  may  direct  an  OPR  or  EPR  before  entering  or  removing  an  individual from the control roster, or both. 3.2.1.1.  The commander should periodically counsel personnel on the control roster about their improvement or failure to improve. 3.2.2.  When  placing  an  officer  on  the  control  roster  who  is  eligible  or  selected  for promotion, or a selective continuation appointment, a commander must decide if the officer is mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified.  If not, initiate action to find the officer not qualified, delay the projected promotion, or remove the officer from the list (see AFI  36-2501,  AFI  36-2610,  Appointing  Regular  Air  Force  Officers  and  Obtaining Conditional Reserve Status, or AFI 36-2504, Officer Promotion, Continuation and Selective Early Removal in the Reserve of the Air Force). 3.2.3.  The  commander  cannot  place  an  individual  on  the  control  roster  as  a  substitute  for more  appropriate  administrative,  judicial,  or  nonjudicial  action.    Being  put  on  the  control roster does not shield an individual from other appropriate actions. 3.2.4.  An individual's name cannot remain on the control roster for more than 6 consecutive months.    AFRC,  ARPC,  RIO  or  TAG  may  establish  longer  observation  periods,  if  deemed appropriate,  for  AFR  and  ANG  personnel,  not  to  exceed  12  months.    If  a  member  is  not rehabilitated in that time, the commander initiates more severe action: 3.2.4.1.  The control roster is cleared at 2400 on the last day of the observation period or on the date a member separates (enlisted only), retires, or dies.  For example, if placed on the roster 1 January, the action expires at 2400 on 30 June.  If affected on 1 September, it expires at 2400 on the last day of February (28th or 29th) 3.2.4.2.  Commanders  may  put  an  individual  back  on  the  control  roster  only  if  a  new incident or failure occurs. 3.2.5.  PCS or PCA reassignment procedures for personnel on the control roster are: AFI36-2907  26 NOVEMBER 2014   27  3.2.5.1.  If the member is put on the control roster, and will leave an overseas area before the end of the observation period, and is otherwise eligible, the commander may extend the member's Date Eligible to Return from Overseas (DEROS) a maximum of 120 days (long  tour  area  only).  A  commander  who  decides  to  involuntarily  extend  the  DEROS advises the Relocation and Employment Elements as soon as possible. 3.2.5.2.  If  the  PCS  reassignment  is  mandatory  (does  not  include  PCS  without  PCA  for separation  processing),  the  losing  base  UIF  monitor  removes  the  UIF  code  2.    The monitor then notes on the individual's AF Form 1137 that "control roster action expired due  to  mandatory  PCS"  before  transferring  the  UIF  to  the  gaining  unit.    Control  roster action expires on the date the member departs.  Note:  This does not apply to unit moves when the member retains the same leadership. 3.2.5.3.  If the PCS reassignment is not mandatory, the person remains eligible for PCS if the observation period expires before the (RNLTD) for the assignment. The commander advises  the  Relocation  Element  of  the  person's  control  roster  status;  the  Relocation Element  notifies  the  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  (AFPC).    AFPC  determines  the individual's assignment eligibility (see AFI 36-2110, Assignments). 3.2.5.4.  For AFR assignments, individuals remain eligible for PCS while on the control roster.    The  losing  commander  or  IMA  Program  Manager  advises  the  MPS  Relocation Section (for unit program) or the gaining IMA Program Manager (for the IMA program) by indicating on the AF Form 1288, Application for Ready Reserve Assignment, that the member  is  on  the  control  roster  and  annotating  the  UIF  disposition  date  in  the  remarks section.    After  reviewing  the  AF  Form  1288,  the  gaining  commander  or  IMA  Program Manager will decide if the assignment is appropriate and will approve or disapprove the assignment. 3.2.5.4.1.  Delay  PCA  when  an  individual  is  on  the  control  roster.    If  the  PCA  is essential  to  the  mission  and  the  losing  and  gaining  commanders  concur,  the  person may be reassigned, but remains on the control roster. 3.2.5.5.  For ANG Statutory Tour Assignments, individuals will not normally be eligible for PCS/PCA while on the control roster.   Any requests for PCS/PCA movement while members  are  on  a  control  roster  should  be  forwarded  to  NGB/HR  for  staffing  to  the appropriate approval authority. 3.2.5.6.  For ANG members in Title 32 member assignments, individuals remain eligible for PCS while on the control roster.  The losing commander advises the MPS Relocation Section  (for  unit  program)  or  the  gaining  unit  by  indicating  on  the  AF  Form  1288, Application for Ready Reserve Assignment, that the member is on the control roster and annotating the UIF disposition date in the remarks section.  After reviewing the AF Form 1288,  the  gaining  commander  will  decide  if  the  assignment  is  appropriate  and  will approve or disapprove the assignment.  (T-3). 3.2.6.  For RegAF, AFR and ANG, the commander cancels all formal training for members during the period they are on the control roster.  (T-1). 3.2.7.  The commander must not put individuals on the control roster who are on TDY, TDY en route, or in PCS status:   28  AFI36-2907  26 NOVEMBER 2014 3.2.7.1.  An individual's time on the control roster does not stop  and start for periods of TDY, ordinary leave, or change in immediate supervisor.  For example, if an individual on the control roster requests 2 weeks leave, the control roster time does not stop for the 2 weeks  the  individual  is  on  leave  and  then  start  again.    The  6  months  is  continuous regardless of the individual's leave or TDY status. 3.3.  Who  Can  Add  or  Remove  Individuals  to  or  from  the  Control  Roster.  The  following individuals have authority to add or remove any assigned or attached enlisted member to or from the  control  roster.    The  following  individuals  also  have  the  authority  to  add  any  assigned  or attached officers to the control roster.  Remove control roster action on officers upon receipt of an AF Form 1058, or memorandum signed by the officer’s wing commander (or equivalent), or issuing authority, whichever is higher.  This early removal option applies regardless of how long the action was on file/in system. 3.3.1.  Commanders on G-series orders at all levels for members assigned or attached to their units.  Commanders must be senior to the member. 3.3.2.  The commander, vice commander, staff director and directors at MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU. 3.3.3.  Chief  of  staff,  deputy  chiefs  of  staff,  assistant  chiefs  of  staff,  other  heads  of  staff agencies, and directors assigned to Headquarters, US Air Force. 3.3.4.  Comparable officers within the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Office of the Secretary of Defense. 3.3.5.  The Senior Air Force officer assigned to a joint command. 3.3.6.  The  Readiness  Management  Group  Program  Manager  for  Civil  Air  Patrol  Reserve Assistance Program and the Admissions Liaison Officer Program. 3.4.  Initiating and Maintaining the Control Roster.  The UIF monitor retrieves and maintains the control roster for the commander: 3.4.1.  Commanders  use  AF  Form  1058  to  initiate  control  roster  action.    Individuals  must acknowledge the action and have 3 duty days to submit a statement on their behalf before the AF  Form  1058  is  finalized.    The  commander  advises  the  individual  of  their  final  decision.  Placement on the control roster is a mandatory UIF entry.  (T-2). 3.4.1.1.  Should be updated to reflect:  For Non-EAD Reservists and ANG DSG members who  depart  the  duty  area  prior  to  the  3  duty  days  allowed  for  acknowledging  intended actions, the individual has 45 calendar days from the date of receipt of the certified letter to  acknowledge  the  notification,  intended  actions,  and  provide  pertinent  information before the commander makes the final decision.  In calculating the time to respond, the date of receipt is not counted, and if the individual mails their acknowledgment, the date of  the  postmark  on  the  envelope  will  serve  as  the  date  of  acknowledgment.    The individual is presumed to be in receipt of official correspondence if it is hand delivered or delivered by certified mail to the individual’s address or best available address. 3.4.1.2.  A  control  roster  will  not  be  created  or  maintained  on  members  assigned  to  the non-participating AFR status (PAS S7XXXXXX). AFI36-2907  26 NOVEMBER 2014   29  Chapter 4 ADMINISTRATIVE COUNSELINGS, ADMONITIONS, AND REPRIMANDS 4.1.  Who  Can  Use  Counseling,  Admonitions,  and  Reprimands.  Commanders,  supervisors, and other persons in authority can issue administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands. These  actions  are  intended  to  improve,  correct,  and  instruct  subordinates  who  depart  from standards  of  performance,  conduct,  bearing,  and  integrity,  on  or  off  duty,  and  whose  actions degrade  the  individual  and  unit's  mission.    This  includes  issuing  administrative  counseling, admonitions, and reprimands to reservists who commit an offense while in civilian status. 4.1.1.  Raters  must  consider  making  comments  on  performance  reports  when  the  ratee receives any of these adverse actions 4.1.2.  Written  administrative  counseling,  admonitions,  and  reprimands  are  subject  to  the rules  of  access,  protection,  and  disclosure  outlined  in  The  Privacy  Act  of  1974,  System  of Records, AFPC L.  The same rules apply to copies kept by supervisors and commanders and those filed in an individual's UIF or the unit's Personnel Information File (PIF). 4.1.3.    Standard of Proof.  While no specific standard of proof applies to administrative action proceedings, commanders should utilize the “preponderance of the evidence” standard when evaluating the evidence and every element of the offenses committed.  A preponderance of the evidence means simply the greater weight of credible evidence. Whether such proof is available should be considered before initiating the administrative action. If such proof is lacking, administrative action is susceptible to being found to be legally unsupportable and, as a result, could be set aside.  There is no requirement to prove any allegation beyond a reasonable doubt. 4.2.  Records  of  Individual  Counseling  (RIC)  and  LOCs.  Counseling helps people use good judgment, assume responsibility, and face and solve problems.  Counselors assist subordinates in developing  skills,  attitudes,  and  behaviors  that  are  consistent  with  maintaining  the  Air  Force's readiness. 4.2.1.  First  line  supervisors,  first  sergeants,  and  commanders  routinely  counsel  individuals either  verbally  or  in  writing,  giving  advice  and  reassuring  subordinates  about  specific situations. 4.2.2.  AF  Form  174,  Record  of  Individual  Counseling,  records  the  counseling  session.    It provides  a  record  of  positive  or  negative  counseling  and  is  useful  when  completing performance  evaluations.    Documenting  counseling  sessions  on  bond  paper  or  letterhead constitutes a LOC. 4.2.3.  Front  line  supervisors  and  first  sergeants  may  recommend  the  commander  file negative or unfavorable RICs, or LOCs in the UIF.  For officer personnel, if the LOC is not filed in the UIF, it must be filed in the individual’s PIF. 4.3.  LOAs.  An admonishment is more severe than a LOC/RIC. Use it to document an infraction serious enough to warrant  the  LOA.  Do not  use it when  a reprimand is  more appropriate. For officer personnel, if the LOA is not filed in the UIF, is must be filed in the individual's PIF.   30  AFI36-2907  26 NOVEMBER 2014 4.4.  LORs.  A  reprimand  is  more  severe  than  a  counseling  or  admonition  and  indicates  a stronger degree of official censure.  Commanders may elect to file a LOR in an UIF for enlisted personnel.  LORs are mandatory for file in the UIF for officer personnel. 4.4.1.  For officer personnel only:  If a person other than the unit commander issues a LOR, send it to the unit commander for acknowledgment and endorsement via AF Form 1058 and establish/file in an UIF.  Include the member’s written acknowledgment and any documents submitted by the member. 4.4.2.  The  AF  Form  1058  does  not  need  to  be  referred  to  the  officer  since  the  rebuttal opportunity is offered at the time the LOR is administered (see  paragraph  4.5.1).  The AF Form 1058 is used only to obtain the commander’s acknowledgment of the action (for LORs administered  by  personnel  other  than  the  commander)  and  to  refer  the  LOR  for  file  in  the UIF. 4.5.  Administering RICs, LOCs, LOAs, or LORs. 4.5.1.  Administer a counseling, admonition, or reprimand, verbally or in writing. If written, the letter states: 4.5.1.1.  What the member did or failed to do, citing specific incidents and their dates. 4.5.1.2.  What improvement is expected. 4.5.1.3.  That further deviation may result in more severe action. 4.5.1.4.  That  the  individual  will  be  allocated  3  duty  days  to  submit  rebuttal  documents for  consideration  by  the  initiator.    For  Non-EAD  Reservists  or  ANG  members:  the individual  has  45  calendar  days  from  the  date  of  receipt  of  the  certified  letter,  to acknowledge the notification, intended actions, and provide pertinent information before the commander makes the final decision.  In calculating the time to respond, the date of receipt is not counted, and if the individual mails their acknowledgment, the date of  the postmark  on  the  envelope  will  serve  as  the  date  of  acknowledgment.    An  individual  is presumed  to  be  in  receipt  of  official  correspondence  if  it  is  delivered  in  person  or  by certified mail to the individual's address or best available address. 4.5.1.5.  That all supporting documents received from the individual will become part of the record. 4.5.1.6.  The person who initiates the LOC, LOA, or LOR has 3 duty days to advise the individual  of  their  final  decision  regarding  any  comments  submitted  by  the  individual.  For Non-EAD Reservists and ANG members:  the initiator has 45 calendar days from the date of personal delivery or date of receipt of the certified letter to reply to the member. AFI36-2907  26 NOVEMBER 2014   31  4.5.2.  The  person  who  initiates  a  RIC/LOC,  LOA,  or  LOR  may  send  it  to  the  member's commander  or  superiors  for  information,  action, or  for  their  approval  for  file  in  the  UIF  or PIF.    Include  the  member's  written  acknowledgment  and  any  documents  submitted  by  the member. For officers, LORs must be filed in the UIF, and any LOAs or LOCs not filed in the UIF, must be filed in the officer's PIF. 4.5.3.  The person who initiates a LOA or LOR for a general officer or general officer select will  forward  the  original  document  and  attachments  to  AF/DPG,AF/REG  or  NGB/GOMO for distribution to the commander.  Mailing addresses are listed in paragraph 2.1.4.3  DANIEL R.
