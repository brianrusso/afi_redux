General.  This  instruction  prescribes  basic  instruction  and  guidance  for  training  United States  Air  Force  Cyberspace  Defense  Analysis  (CDA)  crewmembers  according  to  AFI  17-202 Volume 1, Cybercrew Training (T-2).  Training instruction, guidance, and requirements are set forth  for  each  phase  of  crew  training.    The  objective  of  training  should  be  the  progressive development of CDA crew readiness. 1.2.  Training Objectives. 1.2.1.  The overall objective of the CDA training program is to develop and maintain a high state of readiness for the immediate and effective employment of the weapon system across a full  range  of  tasked  missions.    Mission  readiness  and  effective  employment  are  achieved through the development and mastery of core competencies for CDA crewmembers.  These core  capabilities  include  monitoring  voice,  radio  frequency  communications,  email,  and Internet based capability for operational vulnerabilities. 1.2.2.  The secondary objective is to standardize CDA training requirements within a single source document. 1.3.  Abbreviations, Acronyms and Terms.  See Attachment 1. 1.3.1.  For  the  purposes  of  this  instruction,  “certification”  denotes  a  commander’s  action, whereas qualification denotes a formal Standardization and Evaluation (Stan/Eval). 1.3.2.  Key words explained. 1.3.2.1.  “Will” or “shall” indicates a mandatory requirement. 1.3.2.2.  “Should” indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment. 1.3.2.3.  “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.3.2.4.  “Note”  indicates  operating  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  which  are  considered  essential to emphasize. 1.3.2.5.  Note:  The  term  “squadron”  includes  Air  Reserve  Components  (ARC)  “flight” components. 1.4.  Responsibilities: 1.4.1.  Lead Command.  Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) is lead command for the CDA weapon  system.    The  lead  command  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  standardizing crewmember training requirements in coordination with user commands.  AFSPC/A2/3/6 is authorized to manage all training course requirements and training tasks.  AFSPC/A2/3/6 is the OPR for this AFI; AFSPC/A2/3/6 will (T-2): 1.4.1.1.

Adequate continuity and supervision of individual training needs, experience and proficiencies of assigned and attached crewmembers. (T-3) 1.4.3.5.  Review of training and evaluation records of newly assigned crewmembers and those  completing  formal  training  to  determine  the  training  required  for  them  to  achieve MR or BMC status and to ensure provisions of this volume are met. (T-3) 1.4.3.6.  RCP  missions  are  oriented  towards  maintaining  mission  ready  proficiency through  tactical  employment.    Provide  guidance  to  ensure  only  effective  RCP  missions are logged. (T-3) 1.4.3.7.  Determine missions and events in which individual MR/BMC crewmembers will maintain qualification. (T-3) 1.4.3.8.  Determine utilization of BMC crewmember. (T-3) 1.4.3.9.  Determine special certifications and qualifications (if utilized). (T-3) 1.4.3.10.  Assist the wing or group in the development of the unit training programs. (T-3) 1.4.3.11.  Monitor  assigned  and  attached  crewmember  currencies,  proficiencies,  and requirements. (T-3) AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 7 1.4.3.12.  Ensure crewmembers participate only in sorties, missions, events, and tasks for which they are qualified/certified and adequately prepared, trained, and current. (T-3) 1.4.3.13.  Ensure  flight  commanders  or  designated  representatives  monitor  quality  of training,  identify  training  deficiencies,  and  advise  SQ/CC  or  SQ/DO  of  additional training needs. (T-3) 1.4.4.  Individual crewmembers will: 1.4.4.1.  Be responsible for monitoring and completing all training requirements. (T-3) 1.4.4.2.  Ensure  they  participate  only  in  activities  for  which  they  are  qualified/certified, current, and prepared. (T-3) 1.5.  Training.  Crewmember  training  is  designed  to  progress  a  crewmember  from  Initial Qualification  Training  (IQT),  through  Mission  Qualification  Training  (MQT),  to  annual Continuation  Training  (CT).    Requalification  Training  (RT),  and  Upgrade  Training  (UT),  are additional training requirements for the CDA weapon system. 1.5.1.  IQT.  One or more courses covering system specific and/or positional specific training as a prerequisite to MQT. 1.5.2.  MQT.  MQT prepares an individual for a successful formal evaluation. This training focuses on completing training requirements not met at IQT, mastering local procedures, and increasing proficiency as needed.  MQT ensures a smooth transition from IQT to MR status. 1.5.3.  CT.    Training  that  provides  crew  members  with  the  volume,  frequency,  and  mix  of training  necessary  to  maintain  proficiency  in  the  assigned  position  and  at  the  designated certification/qualification  level.    This  training  is  identified  within  the  respective  lead MAJCOM-provided guidance. 1.5.3.1.  Ready Crewmember Program (RCP).  RCP is the CT program designed to focus training  on  capabilities  needed  to  accomplish  a  unit’s  core  tasked  missions,  fulfill Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statement mission requirements, and/or provide focus on mission sets as determined by the SQ/CC.  Upon completion of IQT and MQT, crews will have received training in all the basic unit missions.  After MQT completion, crews  will  then  be  assigned  to  MR  or  BMC  status  within  the  unit  and  maintain appropriate level of proficiency. (T-3) 1.5.4.  RT.  RT is designed to provide the training necessary to requalify a crew member with an  expired  qualification  evaluation  or  loss  of  currency  exceeding  6  months  (for  currency items specified in Chapter 4).  A crewmember member is considered unqualified upon loss of currency exceeding 6 months, expiration of their qualification evaluation, or completion of a  qualification  evaluation  in  a  different  weapon  system  (unless  multiple  qualification  was approved prior to the evaluation), whichever occurs first.  The duration of unqualified time is measured  from  the  date  the  crewmember  member  became  unqualified  until  the  specific retraining start date. (T-3) 1.5.5.  MR.    A  cybercrew  member  who  satisfactorily  completed  IQT  and  MQT,  and maintains certification, currency and proficiency in the command or unit operational mission is  MR.  Completion  of  IQT,  MQT,  and  a  formal  Stan/Eval  evaluation  are  minimal requirements. (T-3) 8 AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 1.5.5.1.  All  CPI 1/2/A/Z designated positions, to  include SQ/CC and SQ/DO positions, will maintain MR status.  The OG/CC may designate other CPI positions not assigned to the squadron as MR.  See Attachment 4 for CPI explanation and definitions. (T-1) 1.5.5.2.  MR crewmembers will maintain currencies that affect MR status, accomplish all core designated training (missions and events), and all mission related training (T-3). 1.5.6.  BMC.    A  crewmember  member  who  satisfactorily  completed  IQT  and  MQT,  but  is not in fully-certified MR status.  The crewmember member must be able to attain MR status to meet operational taskings as specified in the applicable lead MAJCOM-provided guidance.  This  status  is  primarily  for  individuals  in  units  that  perform  weapon  system-specific operational  support  functions  (i.e.,  formal  training  units,  operational  test  and  tactics development). (T-3) 1.5.6.1.  All CDA crew positions not specifically designated as MR coded positions, are BMC coded.  BMC status is normally assigned to crewmembers with the primary job of performing  wing  supervision  or  staff  functions  that  directly  support  cyber  operations (e.g.,wing  staff,  OSS  personnel,  etc.).    Many  of  these  crewmembers  are  required  to provide additional capability, either in lieu of or in addition to, the personnel assigned to the operational squadrons. (T-3) 1.5.6.2.  BMC  individuals  must  be  able  to  attain  proficiency  and,  if  required, certification/qualification in 30 days or less for those missions/events that they maintain familiarization only. (T-3) 1.5.6.3.  BMC  crewmember  accomplish  all  mission  related  training  designated  by  their attached SQ/CC. (T-3) 1.5.6.4.  Regression  to  Non-MR/BMC  (N-MR/N-BMC).    Once  MR/BMC  status  is awarded,  failure  to  complete  the  required  MR/BMC  CT  and/or  evaluation  requirements will  result  in  regression  to  N-MR/N-BMC  status.    N-MR/N-BMC  personnel  will accomplish  required  training  and  evaluation  and  be  upgraded  to  MR/BMC  before performing operational duties. (T-3) 1.5.7.  Specialized  Training.    Specialized  training  consists  of  training  in  special  skills necessary  to  perform  the  unit's  assigned  mission.    Specialized  training  includes  specialized mission  equipment  training,  etc.,  and  CT  to  maintain  proficiency  in  special  capabilities.  Specialized  training  is  accomplished  upon  assignment  to  MR  or  BMC  status.    Unless otherwise  specified,  crewmembers in  MR  or  BMC  positions  may  hold  special certifications/qualifications provided additional training requirements  are  accomplished.  (T-3) 1.5.7.1.  SQ/CCs will determine and assign crewmembers that will train for and maintain special mission certifications (T-3). 1.6.  Training Concepts and Policies: 1.6.1.  Units  will  design  training  programs  to  achieve  the  highest  degree  of  readiness consistent with safety and resource availability.  Training must balance the need for realism against  the  expected  threat,  crew  capabilities,  and  safety.    This  volume  provides  training guidelines and polices for use with operational procedures specified in applicable operational publications. (T-3) AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 9 1.6.2.  Design  training  to  achieve  mission  capability  in  squadron-tasked  roles,  maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety.  RCP training missions should emphasize  either  basic  mission  skills,  or  scenarios  that  reflect  procedures  and  operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition capabilities.  Use of procedures and actions applicable to mission scenarios are desired. (T-3) 1.6.2.1.  Unless  specifically  directed,  the  SQ/CC  determines  the  level  of  supervision necessary  to  accomplish  the  required  training.    If  the  mission  objectives  include introduction  to  tasks  or  instruction  to  correct  discrepancies  observed  during  a  previous mission, an instructor is required. (T-3) 1.7.  Experienced  Crewmember  Requirements.  CDA/Analysts experienced IAW Table 1.1. (T-3) (CDA/A)  are  declared Table 1.1.  Experienced Crewmember Requirements. Position CDA Analyst (CDA/A) CDA Operations Controller (CDA/OC) SMQ - Web Risk Analysis (CDA-WRA) SMQ - Deployable Voice Monitoring System (CDA-DVMS) SMQ - Fidelis SCOUT (CDA-SCOUT) SMQ - Radio Frequency (CDA-RF) Declared Experienced (Hours) 400 400 CDA/A plus 400 CDA/OC hours 200 200 200 200 1.8.  RCP Policy and Management: 1.8.1.  The RCP training cycle coincides with the fiscal  year and is executed IAW the RCP RTM.    Each  RCP  status  (i.e.,  MR/BMC)  is  defined  by  a  total  number  of  RCP  missions, divided  into  mission  types,  plus  specific  qualifications  and  associated  events  as  determined by HHQ guidance and unit commanders. (T-3) 1.8.2.  The total number of RCP missions for MR/BMC is the primary factor for maintaining an individual's RCP status.  Variations in mission types may be used as a basis for regression as directed by the SQ/CC.  Certification in a mission is determined by the SQ/CC considering HHQ guidance and the individual's capabilities. (T-3) 1.8.3.  An effective RCP training mission requires accomplishing a tactical mission profile or a building block type mission.  Each mission requires successfully completing a majority of the events applicable to that sortie type, as determined by the SQ/CC and Attachment 2. (T-3) 1.8.4.  Non-effective  sorties  are  logged  when  a  training  sortie  is  planned  and  started,  but  a majority  of  valid  training  for  that  type  of  mission  is  not  accomplished  due  to  system 10 AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 malfunction,  power  failures,  etc.    It  is  essential  that  non-effective  sorties  are  logged  and reported appropriately. (T-3) 1.8.5.  A  unit  commander  may  move  an  individual  from  BMC  to  MR  based  on  operational needs.  Progression from BMC to MR requires: 1.8.5.1.  A 1-month look back at the MR mission rate. (T-3) 1.8.5.2.  Current  certification  event  and  qualification  in  all  core  missions  and  events required at MR. (T-3) 1.8.5.3.  Confirmation the progressed crewmember can complete the prorated number of mission and event requirements remaining at MR by the end of the training cycle. (T-3) 1.8.5.4.  Completion  of  mission-related  training,  to  include  a  current  certification  as applicable to the assigned unit’s DOC statement (T-3). 1.8.6.  End  of  cycle  training  requirements  are  based  on  experience  level,  as  outlined  in paragraph 1.7, on the last day of the current training cycle. (T-3) 1.9.  Training Mission Program Development: 1.9.1.  RTM  MR/BMC  mission  and  event  requirements  apply  to  all  MR  and  BMC crewmembers  as  well  as  those  with  special  mission  certifications/qualifications  (see Attachment 2).  The standard mission requirements listed in the RTM establish the minimum number of missions per training cycle for MR and BMC levels of training.  The RTM takes precedence  over  this  volume  and  may  contain  updated  requirements,  missions,  events,  or tasks not  yet incorporated into Attachment 2.  The RTM applies to all CDA crewmembers. (T-3) 1.10.  Training Records and Reports: 1.10.1.  Units  will  maintain  crewmember  records  for  individual  training  and  evaluations IAW: 1.10.1.1.  AFI 17-202 V1, Cybercrew Training 1.10.1.2.  AFI 17-202 V2, Cybercrew Standardization & Evaluation Program 1.10.1.3.  Any additional HHQ supplement to the volumes listed above. 1.10.2.  Track the following information for all crewmembers (as applicable): 1.10.2.1.  Mission-related  training  (e.g.,  tactics  training,  crew  resource  management training, etc.). (T-3) 1.10.2.2.  Requirements  and  accomplishment  of  individual  sorties,  mission  types,  and events cumulatively for the training cycle. (T-3) 1.10.2.3.  RCP  mission  requirements  and  accomplishment  using  1-month  and  3-month running totals for lookback commensurate with CT status (MR/BMC). (T-3) 1.10.2.3.1.  One -1-month Sortie Lookback: Total individual RCP sorties tracked for a  30-day  time  period.    This  lookback  is  used  to  assess  individual  progress  in achieving the Total Sorties (minimum) required for the 12-month training cycle. (T-3) AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 11 1.10.2.3.2.  Three  -  3-Month  Sortie  Lookback:  Total  individual  RCP  sorties  tracked for  a  90-day  time  period.    This  lookback  is  used  to  assess  individual  progress  in achieving the total sorties (minimum) required for the 12-month training cycle. (T-3) 1.10.2.3.3.  ARC (individuals not on orders) will use 3-month lookbacks. (T-3) 1.11.  Crewmember Utilization Policy: 1.11.1.  Commanders will ensure wing/group crewmembers (CPI 6) fill authorized positions IAW  UMDs  and  that  crewmember  status  is  properly  designated  (see  Attachment  4  for  CPI explanation  and  definitions)  (T-2).    The  overall  objective  is  for  crewmembers  to  perform mission-related  duties.    Supervisors  may  assign  crewmembers  to  valid,  short-term  tasks (escort officer, operational review board (ORB), etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of crewmember tasking, proficiency, currency, and experience.  For inexperienced  crewmembers  in  the  first  year  of  their  initial  operational  assignment, supervisors should limit non-crew duties to those related to unit mission activities. (T-3) 1.11.2.  Use evaluators as instructors for any phase of training to capitalize on their expertise and  experience.    If  an  evaluator  is  an  individual’s  primary  (greater  than  half  of  the accomplished training) or recommending instructor, the same evaluator shall not administer the associated evaluation. 1.12.  Sortie Allocation and Unit Manpower Guidance: (T-3) 1.12.1.  In  general,  inexperienced  crewmembers  should  receive  priority  over  experienced crewmembers. (T-3) 1.12.2.  The  RTM  defines  the  minimum  sortie  requirements  for  crewmembers  per  training cycle. (T-3) 1.13.  Training  on  Operational  Missions.  Unless  specifically  prohibited  or  restricted  by weapons  system  operating  procedures,  specific  theater  operations  order  (OPORD),  or  specific higher-headquarter  (HHQ)  guidance,  training  on  live  missions  is  authorized.    In  order  to maximize  efficient  utilization  of  training  resources,  units  will  take  maximum  advantage  of opportunities  to  conduct  appropriate  CT  items  that  may  be  conveniently  suited  to  concurrent operational mission segments.

MQT is a unit-developed training program for IQT graduates required to upgrade to  MR  or  BMC  status  –  it  also  includes  local  unit  indoctrination.    Guidance  in  this  chapter  is provided to  assist SQ/CCs in  developing their MQT program.   Unit  MQT programs  must have OG/CC approval prior to implementation  (T-1).  Squadrons are allowed to tailor their program for  individual  crewmembers,  based  on  current  qualifications  (e.g.,  USAFWS  graduate, instructor),  certifications,  experience,  currency,  documented  performance,  and  formal  training.  Applicable portions of MQT will be used to create a re-qualification program for personnel who are  in  N-MR  or  N-BMC  status.    At  the  completion  of  upgrade  training,  and  a  successful evaluation, individuals achieve MR/BMC for the applicable crew position. (T-3) 3.1.1.  Personnel  in  MQT  may  only  perform  primary  crew  position  duties  under  the  direct supervision  of  an  instructor  for  that  crew  position.    The  instructor  is  responsible  for  all actions and data derived by the personnel in MQT under their supervision. (T-3) 3.2.  MQT Timelines. 3.1.1.  Individuals  will  begin  MQT  no  later  than  45  days  (90  days  for  the  Air  Reserve Component)  after  reporting  to  a  new  duty  station  or  unit,  unless  waived  by  the MAJCOM/A3T.  MQT will be completed within 90 calendar days (180 days for MAJCOM-gained  ARC  units)  starting  from  the  individual’s  date  of  enrollment.    Training  is  complete upon SQ/CC certification of MR/BMC status (subsequent to the successful completion of the MQT MSN qualification evaluation).  Notify the MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) if training exceeds  the  90-day  time  period  or  there  is  a  delay  beginning  MQT  (e.g.,  due  to  security clearance) that exceeds 45 days. (T-3) 3.2.1.  For  individuals  completing  in-unit  IQT,  the  first  MQT  training  event  must  be completed within 15 calendar days from the completion of IQT.  Further extensions require MAJCOM approval. (T-2) 3.3.  Initial Certification: 3.3.1.  Initial  MR  certification  must  be  completed  within  45  days  after  completing  MQT (recommended,  but  not  required  for  BMC).    Each  individual  will  demonstrate  to  a  formal board a satisfactory knowledge of the squadron’s primary DOC statement  missions.  Board composition  will  be  established  by  the  SQ/CC.    Desired  composition  is  SQ/CC  or  SQ/DO (chairman),  weapons,  training,  intelligence,  and  other  mission-area  expert  representatives. (T-3) 3.4.  Mission Qualification Training: 3.4.1.  Objectives: Be familiar with local area requirements and procedures.  Specific mission tasks: local area familiarization, emergency procedures, and other tasks as determined by the unit. (T-3) 3.4.2.  MQT programs should use profiles typical of squadron missions. (T-3) 3.4.2.1.  Mission  sequence  and  prerequisites  will  be  IAW  the  appropriate  unit  MQT course syllabus (T-3). AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 17 3.4.2.2.  Individual  events  may  be  accomplished  anytime  during  MQT,  however  all events will be accomplished prior to SQ/CC certification of MR/BMC status (T-3). 3.4.3.  Supervision.  An instructor is required for all upgrade training missions. (T-3) 3.4.4.  Minimum  Sortie  Requirements.    The  minimum  sorties  required  in  a  local  MQT program will be IAW the MQT course syllabus (not required if portions of the MQT program are  used  to  recertify  crewmembers  that  have  regressed  from  MR  to  BMC).    Reference  the paragraphs  below  for  further  details  and  recommended  sortie  flows  SQ/CCs  may  use  to develop the unit's MQT program. (T-3) 3.4.5.  Training  will  be  completed  within  the  time  specified  by  the  syllabus.    Failure  to complete  within  the  specified  time  limit  requires  notification  through  channels  to  the MAJCOM/A3T  or  equiavalent  with  crewmember’s  name,  rank,  reason  for  delay,  planned actions, and estimated completion date. (T-3) 3.4.6.  Formal  course  syllabus  mission  objectives  and  tasks  are  minimum  requirements  for MQT.    However,  additional  training  events,  based  on  student  proficiency  and  background, may be incorporated into the MQT program with SQ/CC authorization.  Additional training due  to  student  non-progression  is  available  within  the  constraints  of  the  formal  course syllabus and may be added at SQ/CC discretion. (T-3) 3.5.  MQT for Senior Officers: 3.5.1.  Senior  officers  must  meet  course  entry  prerequisites  and  will  complete  all  syllabus requirements unless waived by the MAJCOM/A3 (T-2). 3.5.2.  Senior  officers  will  be  considered  in  a  formal  training  status  for  the  duration  of  the course.  Their duties will be delegated to appropriate CDs or CVs until training is completed.  Waiver  authority  for  this  paragraph  is  the  MAJCOM/CC  (submitted  through  the MAJCOM/A3) (T-2). 18 AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General.  This  chapter  establishes  the  minimum  crewmember  training  requirements  to maintain MR or BMC.  The SQ/CC will ensure each crewmember receives sufficient training to maintain individual currency and proficiency. (T-3) 4.2.  Crew Status.  SQ/CCs will assign crewmembers a crew status using the following criteria (T-3): 4.2.1.  Mission  Ready.    A  crewmember  who  satisfactorily  completed  IQT  and  MQT,  and maintains  qualification,  certification,  currency  and  proficiency  in  the  command  or  unit operational  mission.    Following  IQT,  MQT  is  a  formal  training  program  used  to  qualify crewmembers  in  assigned  crew  positions  to  perform  the  unit  mission.  This  training  is required to achieve a basic level of competence in the unit's primary tasked missions and is a prerequisite for MR or BMC declaration. 4.2.2.  Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC).    The  status  of  a  crewmember  who  satisfactorily completed  IQT  and  MQT  to  perform  the  unit’s  basic  operational  missions,  but  does  not maintain MR status.  Crewmember accomplishes training required to remain familiarized in all  and  may  be  qualified  and  proficient  in  some  of  the  primary  missions  of  their  weapon system  BMC  requirements.    These  crewmembers  may  also  maintain  special  mission qualification. 4.2.2.1.  The  crewmember  shall  be  able  to  attain  MR  status  to  meet  operational  tasking within 30 days. (T-3) 4.2.2.2.  The OG/CC may declare an assigned or attached crewmember MR for a portion of the unit’s operational  mission if all training requirements are met.  The crewmember does not need to attain MR status unless directed by the OG/CC. (T-3) 4.2.2.3.  BMC  instructors  and  evaluators  may  log  instructor  or  evaluator  time  for  the portion of the mission for which they are current and qualified. (T-3) 4.2.3.  MR and BMC crewmembers will accomplish and/or maintain RCP requirements, for their respective status, and the appropriate events in the RCP tables in this instruction and the RTM. (T-3) 4.3.  Training  Events/Tables.  Standardized  training  events  identifiers  and  descriptions  are  in Attachment 2.  Units will add unit-specific events to include a description in their local training documents (T-3).   Credit  events  accomplished  on 4.3.1.  Crediting  Event  Accomplishment. training, operational missions and satisfactory evaluations or certifications toward RCP requirements and  establish  a  subsequent  due  date.    Use  date  of  successful  evaluation  as  the  date  of accomplishment  for  all  formal  course  mission-related  training  events.    A  successful evaluation establishes a new current and qualified reference date for all accomplished events.  For  IQT  or  requalification  training,  events  accomplished  prior  to  the  evaluation  are  not creditable  for  any  crew  position.    In  all  cases,  events  successfully  accomplished  during  the evaluation or certification are creditable toward the crew position. (T-3) AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 19 4.3.2.  For an unsatisfactory evaluation, do not log CT requirements for those events graded U/Q3 (according to AFI 17-202V2) until re-qualified. (T-3) 4.3.3.  Instructors  and  evaluators  may  credit  no  more  than  50  percent  of  their  total  CT requirements while instructing or evaluating. (T-3) 4.4.  Continuation  Training  Requirements.  Completion and tracking of continuation training is  ultimately  the  responsibility  of  the  individual  crewmember.    Crewmembers  should  actively work  with  their  supervisors,  unit  schedulers  and  training  offices  to  ensure  accomplishment  of their  continuation  training  requirements.    Crewmembers  attached  to  units  are  responsible  for reporting accomplished training events to their attached unit. (T-3) 4.4.1.  Mission-Related  Training  Events.    Crewmembers  will  comply  with  requirements  of Table 4.1. (T-3) 4.4.2.  Weapons and Tactics Academic Training.  Units will establish a weapons and tactics academic  training  program  to  satisfy  MQT  and  CT  requirements.    Training  is  required annually during each training cycle.  SQ/CCs will provide guidance to unit weapons shops to ensure  all  crewmembers  are  informed/reminded  of  new/current  weapons,  systems,  and mission-specific TTPs. (T-3) 4.4.2.1.  Academic instructors should be the Chief of Weapons and Tactics. 4.4.2.2.  Instruction should include (as applicable), but is not limited to: 4.4.2.2.1.  Applicable  AF  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedure  (AFTTP)  3-1  &  3-3 series publications, AFI  17-2CDA Volume 3, and other documents pertaining to the execution of the unit’s mission. (T-3) 4.4.2.2.2.  Specialized capabilities, rules of engagement (ROE), and other mission related activities. (T-3) to  support  specific  weapons, training tactics,  mission 4.4.3.

Briefings  will  include  the  concepts  outlined  in  AFPAM  90-803,  Risk Management (RM) Guidelines and Tools.  RM training will be tracked.  Failure to complete RM training will result in Non Mission Ready (NMR) status. (T-3) 4.5.  Mission-Related Training: 4.5.1.  Units  will  develop  training  covering  areas  pertinent  to  the  mission  as  determined  by the  SQ/CC  (T-1).    Training  accomplished  during  IQT  may  be  credited  towards  this requirement.  Incorporate appropriate portions of AFTTP 3-1.CDA and other mission-related documents. (T-3) 4.5.2.  Mission-related  training  may  be  tailored  to  the  individual's  background,  experience and  local  conditions.    Current  and  available  reference  materials,  such  as  AFTTP  3-1.CDA, other applicable AFTTP 3-1s and 3-3s, unit guides, and other available training material and programs, will be used as supporting materials to the maximum extent possible.

Total  sorties  and  events  are minimums which ensure training to continually meet all DOC tasked requirements and may not be reduced except in proration/waiver.  Unless otherwise stated the OG/CC is the waiver authority for all RCP requirements and for all provisions in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 of this volume.  Failure to accomplish events in these tables may lead to NMR status. (T-3) 4.6.  Specialized Mission Training (SMT).  Training in any special skills necessary to perform the unit's assigned mission not required by every crewmember.  Specialized training consists of CT  to  maintain  certification,  currency,  and  proficiency  in  unit  tasked  special  capabilities  and missions. (T-3) 4.6.1.  Specialized  training/certifications  are  normally  accomplished  after  a  crewmember  is assigned  MR/BMC  status  and  is  normally  in  addition  to  MR/BMC  requirements.  (See Chapter 5) (T-3) 4.6.2.  The  SQ/CC  will  determine  and  assign  crewmembers  that  train  for  and  maintain special mission qualifications and certifications. (T-3) 4.7.  Multiple Weapon System Qualification/Currency.  See AFI 17-202 V1, AFI 17-202 V2, applicable  HHQ  guidance,  and  AFI  17-2  CDA  Volume  2,  Air  Force  Cyberspace  Defense Analysis (CDA) Standardization and Evaluation (AFI 17-2 CDAV2) for multiple qualifications. 4.7.1.  Multiple crew qualifications are not appropriate for senior wing supervisors. (T-3) 4.7.2.  Multiple  Requirements.    Crewmembers  will  satisfy  at  least  50  percent  of  the  sortie requirements  in  their  primary  weapon  system.    If  MR,  they  will  meet  all  RCP  mission  and event requirements of the primary weapon system (T-3). 4.7.3.  Multiple Currencies.  Crewmembers will conduct a sortie at least once each 45 days in each weapon system.  They will comply with all other currency requirements for each crew currencies. (T-3) 4.7.4.  Multiple weapon system qualified individuals must complete training IAW approved syllabus for each weapon system. (T-3) 4.8.  Currencies, Recurrencies and Requalification. 4.8.1.  Currency.    The  RTM  defines  currency  requirements  for  MR/BMC  crewmembers.  Crewmembers  may  not  instruct,  evaluate  or  perform  any  event  in  which  they  are  not qualified and current unless under instructor supervision.  Currency may be: AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 21 4.8.1.1.  Maintained  by  accomplishing  the  event  as  a  qualified  crewmember  provided member’s currency has not expired. (T-3) 4.8.1.2.  Established  or  updated  by  accomplishing  the  event  as  a  crewmember  under supervision of a current instructor. (T-3) 4.8.1.3.  Events satisfactorily performed on any training mission, evaluation, or operation may be used to establish or update currency in that event. (T-3) 4.8.2.  If an individual currency expires, thereby  requiring recurrency, that mission or event may  not  be  performed  except  for  the  purpose  of  regaining  currency.    Non-current  events must  be  satisfied  before  the  individual  is  considered  certified/qualified  (as  applicable)  to perform  those  events  unsupervised.    Loss  of  currencies  affecting  MR  status  will  require regression to N-MR). (T-3) 4.9.  Loss  of  Instructor  Status  and  Requalification/Recurrency.  Instructors  may  lose instructor status for the following: 4.9.1.  They become noncurrent in a mission or event which causes removal from MR/BMC status and the SQ/CC deems loss of currency is of sufficient importance to require complete decertification (but not a complete loss of qualification). (T-3) 4.9.2.1.  As long  as the  affected individual  retains instructor qualification  IAW AFI 17-202V2, recertification will be at the SQ/CC’s discretion. (T-3) 4.9.2.2.  If  the  SQ/CC  does  not  elect  to  decertify  the  individual  or  if  the  individual becomes noncurrent in missions or events which do not require removal from MR/BMC status, instructor status may be retained, but the instructor will not instruct that mission or event until the required currency is regained. (T-3) 4.9.3.  Crewmembers losing instructor currency must accomplish the following: 4.9.3.1.  61-180 Days.  Instructor recurrency with another current/qualified instructor. (T-3) 4.9.3.2.  Over 180 Days.  Conduct  an instructor evaluation  and document  IAW AFI 17-202V2, applicable HHQ guidance, and AFI 17-2 CDAV2. (T-3) 4.9.4.  Instructor  Lack  of  Ability.    Instructors  serve  solely  at  the  discretion  of  the  SQ/CC. Instructors should exemplify a higher level of performance and present themselves as reliable and  authoritative  experts  in  their  respective  duty  positions.   Instructors  exhibiting substandard  performance  should  be  reviewed  for  suitability  of  continued  instructor  duty.  Instructors will be decertified if (T-3): 4.9.4.1.  Awarded a less than fully qualified grade in any area of the evaluation regardless of overall crew position qualification. (T-3) 4.9.4.2.  Failure of a qualification. (T-3) 4.9.4.3.  SQ/CC  deems  instructor  is  substandard,  ineffective,  or  providing  incorrect procedures, techniques, or policy guidance. (T-3) 4.9.4.4.  Decertified  instructors  may  regain  instructor  status  by  correcting  applicable deficiency and completing the training and/or evaluation as specified by the SQ/CC. (T-3) 22 AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 4.9.4.5.  Instructors fail to maintain currency resulting in removal of MR/BMC status.  If an  instructor  becomes  N-MR/N-BMC,  they  cannot  instruct  in  that  position  until  all currency requirements are completed. (T-3) 4.10.  Regression. 4.10.1.  MR/BMC  Regression  for  Failure  to  Meet  Lookback.    Only  RCP  training  missions, evaluations, or operations sorties may be used for lookback.  If the individual does not meet lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, SQ/CC should remove the crewmember from a MR/BMC status. 4.10.2.  RCP is an integral part of CT for crewmembers because, when they exceed the time interval  for  any  RCP  event  or  task,  they  become  non-MR  or  non-BMC  and  enter  into  a phased training status for the overdue event or task.  The different levels of training required to  regain  MR  or  BMC  status  are  based  on  the  amount  of  time  the  crewmember  is  non-current. (T-3) 4.10.3.  Failure  to  meet  RCP  requirements  for  any  event  (as  calculated  from  the  date  the event  was  last  accomplished)  will  result  in  loss  of  currency  for  the  overdue  event  and regression  to  N-MR/N-BMC  status  for  that  crew  position.    Members  failing  to  meet  RCP requirements will be supervised by a qualified instructor until the delinquent RCP events are complete as outlined in Table 4.2. (T-3) Table 4.2.  RCP Non-Currency Requirements. (T-3). Number of Days Since RCP Item Last Accomplished Requirement to Regain Currency Up to 90 Days 91-180 Days   181+ Days  Complete delinquent RCP tasks with an instructor current and qualified in the same crew position to reclaim MR/BMC status. Complete SQ/CC approved recertification program (documented in the individual’s training folder) to return the crewmember to MR/BMC standards. Upon completion of the recertification program, the MR/BMC crewmember must also meet the subsequent 1-month lookback requirement and take open/closed book exams IAW AFI 17-202V2 prior to reclaiming MR/BMC status.  Open/closed book exams will be documented IAW AFI 17-202V2.    Reaccomplish SQ/CC-directed MQT program to include a formal MSN evaluation IAW AFI         17-202V2, applicable HHQ guidance, and AFI 17-2CDAV2. AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 23 4.10.4.  Failed Evaluations or Commander Directed Downgrades.  Crewmembers who fail a periodic  evaluation  or  receive  a  commander  directed  downgrade  are  unqualified.  Crewmembers  will  remain  unqualified  until  successfully  completing  required  corrective action, re-evaluation, and re-certification by the SQ/CC. (T-3) 4.11.  End  of  Cycle  Requirements.  Crewmembers  who  fail  to  complete  mission  or  event requirements by the end of training cycle may require additional training depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency.  Refer to paragraph 4.12 for proration guidance.  In all cases, units will report training shortfalls to the OG/CC. (T-3) 4.11.1.  Crewmembers  failing  to  meet  annual  RCP  events  or  minimum  total  sortie requirements  may  continue  CT  at  MR/BMC  as  determined  by  lookback.    The  SQ/CC  will determine if additional training is required. (T-3) 4.11.2.  Failure to meet specific MR and BMC mission type requirements will result in one of the following: 4.11.2.1.  Regression, if the SQ/CC determines the mission type deficiency is significant.  To  regain  MR/BMC,  the  individual  will  complete  all  deficient  mission  types.    These missions  may  also  be  counted  toward  the  total  requirements  for  the  new  training  cycle. (T-3) 4.11.2.2.  MR/BMC  may  be  maintained  if  total  RCP  missions  and  lookback  are maintained  and  the  mission  type  deficiencies  are  deemed  insignificant  by  the  SQ/CC.  The SQ/CC will determine if any additional training is required to address shortfalls. (T-3) 4.11.3.  Failure  to  accomplish  missions/events  required  for  Special  Mission  capabilities  or certifications/qualifications will result in loss of that certification/qualification.  The SQ/CC will determine recertification requirements.  Requalification requirements are  IAW AFI 17-202V2 applicable HHQ guidance, and AFI 17-2CDAV2. (T-3) 4.12.  Proration of Training. 4.12.1.  Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements.  At the end of the training cycle the SQ/CC may  prorate  any  training  requirements  precluded  by  the  following  events:  initial  arrival  in squadron,  emergency  leave,  non-mission  TDYs  (i.e.,  PME),  exercises,  or  deployments. Ordinary  annual  leave  will  not  be  considered  as  non-availability.    Other  extenuating circumstances, as determined by the SQ/CC, that prevent crewmembers from mission duties for  more  than  15  consecutive  days  may  be  considered  as  non-availability  for  proration purposes.  The following guidelines apply: 4.12.1.1.  Proration will not be used to mask training or planning deficiencies. (T-3) 4.12.1.2.  Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for mission duties in the training cycle.  Use Table 4.3 to determine the number of months to be prorated based on each period of cumulative non-mission duty calendar days. (T-3) 4.12.1.3.  If  IQT  or  MQT  is  re-accomplished,  a  crewmember’s  training  cycle  will  start over at a prorated share following completion of IQT/MQT. (T-3) 24 AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 4.12.1.4.  No  requirement  may  be  prorated  below  one.    Prorated  numbers  resulting  in fractions  of  less  than  0.5  will  be  rounded  to  the  next  lower  whole  number  (one  or greater). (T-3) 4.12.1.5.  Newly assigned individuals achieving MR/BMC after the 15th of the month are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration purposes.  A prorated share of RCP missions must be completed in CT. (T-3) 4.12.1.6.  A  crewmember’s  last  month  on  station  prior  to  PCSing  may  be  prorated provided one month's proration is not exceeded.  Individuals PCSing may be considered MR for reporting purposes during a period of 60 days from date of last mission/sortie, or until loss of MR currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty station, whichever occurs first. (T-3) 4.12.1.7.  Example: TSgt Jones was granted 17 days of emergency leave in January and attended NCOA in residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days. The  SQ/CC  authorized  a  total  of  two  months  proration  from  her  training  cycle  (two months for the 73 cumulative days of non-availability). (T-3) Table 4.3.  Proration Allowance. CUMULATIVE DAYS OF NON-MISSION ACTIVITY  0 – 15 16 – 45  46 – 75  76 – 105  106 – 135  136 – 165 166 – 195 196 – 225  226 – 255  256 – 285  286 – 315  316 – 345  Over 345  PRORATION ALLOWED (Months) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 4.12.2.  Operational  Missions.  The following procedures  are intended to provide flexibility in  accomplishing  the  unit's  CT  program.    Sorties  conducted  during  these  missions  will  be logged.  These sorties count toward annual RCP requirements and will be used for lookback purposes.    Operational  missions  and  events  may  be  used  to  update  proficiency/currency requirements if they meet the criteria in Attachment 2. (T-3) 4.13.  Regaining MR/BMC Status. 4.13.1.  If MR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet the end-of-cycle event requirements, re-certification/re-qualification is IAW paragraph 4.10. (T-3) AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 25 4.13.2.  If MR/BMC status is  lost  due to failure to  meet  lookback  IAW paragraph 4.10, the following applies (timing starts from the date the individual came off MR/BMC status): 4.13.2.1.  Up to 90 Days.  On the 91st day to the 180th day, the individual must complete a SQ/CC approved recertification program (documented in the individual’s training folder) to return the crewmember to MR/BMC standards.  Upon completion of the recertification program,  the  MR/BMC  crewmember  must  also  meet  the  subsequent  1-month  lookback requirement prior to reclaiming MR/BMC status.  The missions and events accomplished during  the  recertification  program  may  be  credited  towards  their  total/type  mission  and event  requirements  for  the  training  cycle  as  well  as  for  their  monthly  mission requirement.   In addition,  all RCP event  currencies must be  regained.  The SQ/CC will approve any other additional training prior to MR recertification. (T-3) 4.13.2.2.  91-180  Days.   Same  as  above,  plus  open/closed  book  qualification examinations (IAW AFI 17-202V2).  Open/closed book exams will be documented IAW AFI 17-202V2 and AFI 17-2CDAV2. (T-3)  4.13.2.3.  181  Days  and  Beyond.      Reaccomplish  a  SQ/CC-directed  MQT  program  to include  a  formal  MSN  evaluation  IAW  AFI  17-202V2,  applicable  HHQ  guidance,  and AFI 17-2CDAV2. (T-3) Figure 4.1.  Regression Flow Chart.  26 AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 Chapter 5 UPGRADE AND SPECIALIZED MISSION TRAINING 5.1.  General.

Units  will  develop  and  maintain  an  instructor  test  master  question  file.    Prior  to  the 28 AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 evaluation, instructor candidates will meet performance training standards IAW the CDA Instructor Upgrade course syllabus. (T-3) 5.3.1.6.  Qualification  and  Certification.    Instructor  evaluations  will  be  conducted  IAW AFI 17-202V2and AFI 17-2 CDAV2 (T-2).  The student is qualified to perform instructor duties  after  meeting  all  the  criteria  above,  completing  training,  and  a  successful  initial instructor  evaluation.    SQ/CC  will  certify  a  new  instructor  by  placing  a  letter  of certification in the training folder and indicate qualifications on a letter of Xs. (T-3) 5.4.  Difference Training. 5.4.1.  Difference Training (DT) is required for qualified and certified crewmembers when a new  feature,  variation,  capability  or  procedure  is  initially  introduced  into  the  CDA  weapon system,  when  an  existing  feature  is  introduced  to  a  field  site,  or  upon  PCS  or  TDY  to  a new/different field site. (T-3) 5.4.1.1.  Initial Introduction into CDA weapon system. 5.4.1.1.1.  When  a  new  feature,  variation,  capability  or  procedure  is  initially introduced  to  the  weapon  system,  it  requires  new  certification  for  each  applicable crew position.  The OG/CC will identify, and Wing/CC will approve the initial cadre, which is responsible to develop initial training materials  (T-1).  Units will use these training  materials  to  conduct  difference  training  and  award  certifications  to  all applicable crew positions for successful mission execution. (T-3) 5.4.1.2.  Existing Feature Introduced to a field site Location. 5.4.1.2.1.  DT is required when an existing feature, variation, capability or procedure is introduced to a field site that didn’t have it previously.  That location will identify an initial cadre that will obtain training and training materials from a designated site operating with that feature. (T-3) 5.4.1.3.  PCS/TDY to another field site. 5.4.1.3.1.  Local area procedures for each field site may be different, and emergency area  procedures  for  each  field  site  will  be  different.  When  a  qualified  crewmember operates at  another field  site, that individual will require locally created DT prior to performing mission duties.   Initial cadre is  not  necessary for this difference training type. (T-3) 5.4.2.  DT  may  be  incorporated  into  qualification  and/or  certification  standards,  as appropriate. (T-3) 5.4.3.  Difference Training Timelines. Personnel that enter DT must accomplish the training within 60 calendar days (90 days for MAJCOM-gained AFRC and ANG units) from the date entered into training.

The crewmember  will  carry  BCQ  only  until  completion  of  MQT.    BCQ  crewmembers  will  not perform RCP-tasked events or sorties without instructor supervision. Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC)—A  crewmember who satisfactorily  completed  IQT  and MQT to  perform  the  unit’s  basic  operational  missions,  but  does  not  maintain  MR  status.    The crewmember  accomplishes training required to  remain familiarized in  all  and may be qualified and  proficient  in  some  of  the  primary  missions  of  their  weapon  system  BMC  requirements.  These crewmembers may also maintain special mission qualification. Certification—Designation of an individual by the certifying official (normally the SQ/CC) as having completed required training and being capable of performing a specific duty. Continuation  Training  (CT)—  Training  which  provides  crewmembers  with  the  volume, frequency,  and  mix  of  training  necessary  to  maintain  currency  and  proficiency  in  the  assigned qualification level. 32 AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 Currency—A  measure  of  how  frequently  and/or  recently  a  task  is  completed.    Currency requirements should ensure the average crewmember maintains a minimum level of proficiency in a specific event. Cybercrew Position Indicator (CPI)—Codes used to manage crewmember positions to ensure a high state of readiness is maintained with available resources. Cyberspace  Defense  Analysis—Analyst  (CDA/A)  -  This  position's  responsibilities  include: process  assigned  data  (Calls,  Emails,  IbC,  and  CORA);  analyze  data  and  assess  impact  to AF/DoD  operations;  notify  the  CDA/OC  with  flagged  items,  questions,  concerns;  identify  and promptly  report  Classified  Message  Incidents  (CMI)s  and  serious  crimes  and  emergency situations;  Information  Protection  Alerts  (IPAs,  immediate  reports,  Personally  Identifiable Information  (PII)  Breach  Reports,  Network  Vulnerability  Reports  (NVR),  Summary  Reports, Transcripts,  CORA;  develop  pre-  and  post-mission  briefings;  create/modify  Fidelis  keyword searches;  install  Deployable  Voice  Monitoring  System  (DVMS)  and  Fidelis  Scout;  operate Fidelis, DVMS, and Fidelis Scout; and identify and report all system errors to the CDA/OC. Cyberspace Defense Analysis—Operations Controller (CDA/OC) - In addition to the CDA/A responsibilities listed below, this position's responsibilities include: task each crewmember with Calls, Email/IbC, or Cyberspace Operational Risk Assessment (CORA) data to analyze; task or create mission brief or out-brief; manage frontline folder and determine if data meets reporting criteria;  task  or  write  Telephone  Monitoring  and  CORA  reports;  task  or  create/modify  Fidelis keyword searches; task or create phone line list; assist CDA/As with research, report write-ups, and  identified  disclosures;  quality  check  analyst  reports;  monitor  CDA/As  for  flagged  items, questions,  and  concerns;  notify  the  Mission  Supervisor  (MS)  when  reports  are  ready  for  final review; finalize and submit reports to the MD; purge alerts when authorized by the, MD; identify manning  shortages  and  elevate  to  the  MD;  identify  mission  system  problems/concerns  and elevate to the MD; and immediately notify the MD of any emergency situations, serious crimes, or CMI. Cyberspace Operations  (CO)—The employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace. Experienced  Crewmember  (EXP)—Experienced  crewmember  that  meets  the  requirements  in paragraph 1.7. Mission—A  set  of  tasks  that  lead  to  an  objective,  to  include  associated  planning,  brief, execution, and debrief. .

This posisition does not require a separate certification. Mission  Qualification  Training  (MQT)—Following  IQT,  MQT  is  a  formal  training  program used  to  qualify  crewmember  members  in  assigned  crew  positions  to  perform  the  unit  mission.  This training is required to achieve a basic level of competence in unit's primary tasked missions and is a prerequisite for MR or BMC declaration. AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 33 Mission  Ready—A  crewmember  who  satisfactorily  completed  IQT  and  MQT,  formal evaluation,  and  maintains  certification,  currency  and  proficiency  in  the  command  or  unit operational mission. Proficiency—Demonstrated  ability  to  successfully  accomplish  tasked  events  safely  and effectively.  For  purposes  of  this  instruction,  proficiency  also  requires  currency  in  the  event,  if applicable.    A  crewmember  is  considered  proficient  when  they  can  perform  tasks  at  the minimum acceptable levels of speed, accuracy, and safety. Qualification—Designation  of  an  individual  by  the  unit  commander  as  having  completed required training and evaluation and being capable of performing a specific duty. Ready  Cybercrew  Program  (RCP)—RCP  is  the  formal  continuation  training  (CT)  program that provides the baseline for squadrons to develop a realistic training program meeting all DOC statement tasked requirements as well as specific NAF mission prioritization.  RCP defines the minimum  required  mix  of  annual  sorties,  simulator  missions,  and  training  events  crews  must accomplish  to  sustain  mission  readiness.    These  programs  have  clearly  defined  objectives  and minimum standards that enhance mission accomplishment and safety.  RCP sorties are tracked.  In order to be effective, each mission must successfully complete a sufficient number of events applicable  to  that  mission  type,  as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC.    With  completion  of  IQT  and MQT,  a  crewmember  is  trained  in  all  the  basic  missions  of  a  specific  unit,  unless  a  specific exception is provided in Chapter 3 of the MDS-specific Vol 1.  RCP applies to CMR/MR and BMC positions. Sortie—The  actions  taken  with  an  individual  cyberspace  weapon  system  to  accomplish  a mission and/or mission objective(s) within a defined start and stop period. Special  Mission  Qualifications—Some  MR  and  BMC  crewmembers  will  carry  additional qualifications  in  special  missions.    Unit  CC/DO  will  determine  which  crewmembers  will  be qualified in special mission events.  Unit CC/DO will determine if special mission events have affected  C-rating  and  report  variations  through  Status  of  Resources  and  Training  Systems (SORTS).  Special mission requirements are also shown in the RTM MR table. Special  Mission  Training—Training  in  any  special  skills  necessary  to  perform  the  unit’s assigned missions that are not required by every crewmember.  Specialized training is normally accomplished after the crewmember is assigned MR or BMC status, and is normally in addition to MR or BMC requirements.  May be an additional certification or qualification event as determined by the unit commander. Supervised  Status—The  status  of  a  crewmember  that  must  perform  missions  while  being supervised by an instructor. Supervisory Crewmember or Staff Member—Personnel in supervisory or staff positions (CPI 6 & 8) who actively conduct cyber operations. Training Level—Assigned to individuals based on the continuation training status (basic cyber qualification, basic mission capable, or mission ready/combat mission ready) they are required to maintain. Training  Period—Any  training period determined by the wing in  which training requirements are performed. 34 AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 Attachment 2 GLOSSARY OF MISSION, SORTIE AND EVENT DEFINITIONS A2.1.

ESSA  missions identify  and  report  disclosed  information  that  could  be  used  to  compromise  missions, gain  access  to  sensitive  capabilities,  and  deny  knowledge  of  critical  resources.    ESSA utilizes  the  following  tools:  telephony,  e-mail,  IbC,  radio  frequency  (RF),  and  web  risk assessment (WRA).  Authority is derived from DODI 8560.01, Communications Security (COMSEC) Monitoring and Information Assurance (IA) Readiness Testing. A2.1.1.1.1.  Telephony  Communications:  The  monitoring  and  assessment  of  AF unclassified voice networks which if exploited by adversaries, can negatively impact AF operations. A2.1.1.1.2.  E-mail Communications: The monitoring and assessment of unclassified AF email traffic entering or exiting the AFIN which if exploited by adversaries, can negatively impact AF operations. A2.1.1.1.3.  IbC:  (Internet  Based  Capabilities):  The  monitoring  and  assessment  of unencrypted  SMTP  and  HTTP  communications  that  either  enter  or  leave  the  AF Gateway  architecture.    NOTE:  CDA  units  only  “monitor”  the  web  sessions  that transverse  the  AFIN  and  not  the  IbC  sites  themselves.    IbCs  include  collaborative tools  such  as  social  networking  sites  (SNS),  social  media,  user-generated  content, social  software,  e-mail,  instant  messaging,  and  discussion  forums  (e.g.,  YouTube, Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, Google Apps, etc.). A2.1.1.1.4.  Radio Frequency (RF) Communications: The monitoring and assessment of  AF  communications  within  the  VHF,  UHF,  FM,  HF,  and  SHF  frequency  bands (e.g.,  mobile  phones,  land  mobile  radios,  wireless  local  area  networks)  which  if exploited by adversaries, can negatively impact AF operations. A2.1.1.1.5.  WRA: The assessment of information posted on AF unclassified, owned, leased, or operated public and private web sites in order to minimize exploitation of AF information by adversaries that can negatively impact AF operations. A2.1.2.  AIM  Mission:  Identifies  activities  that  potentially  expose  AF  networks,  systems and personnel to increased risk as a result of the action or inaction of an authorized user who discloses AF system credentials, accounts, exploitable network configuration information or PII.  Protects  the  Air  Force,  DOD  and  government  networks.    AIM  missions  identify  and report disclosed information that could be used to gain authorized access to compromise AF networks and devices.  AIM tools include, but are not limed to e-mail and IbC. AFI17-2CDAV1  7 JUNE 2017 35 A2.1.2.1.

A2.1.3.  CORA Mission  : The analysis of compromised data from adversary exfiltration or friendly transmission outside of U.S. Government control, with the objective of determining the  associated  impact  to  Air  Force  operations  and  technology  resulting  from  the  data  loss.  CORA applies OPSEC principles and processes in the conduct of responsive and systematic analysis of the content of compromised data leaving the AFIN.  While there are other similar capabilities analyzing  compromised computers and networks, they are focused on methods, techniques,  system  vulnerability  identification,  and  the  identification  or  attribution  of  an adversary.    CORA  is  a  contributor  to  the  overall  Information  Damage  Assessment  (IDA) process.  It is focused on the nature and content of the compromised information itself, and the  potential  impact  of  its  loss  within  the  final  IDA  product.    CORA  capabilities  assist information  owners  in  determining  the  operational  risk  and  impact  of  compromised information.  Mitigates  the  effects  of  lost  Air  Force,  DOD  and  government  operations, capabilities, and resources.  When conducting CORA missions CDA units are not monitoring or collecting any information from the AFIN.  CORA is focused on the nature and content of the compromised information itself, and the potential impact of its loss within the final IDA product.    CORA  capabilities  assist  information  owners  in  determining  the  operational  risk and impact of compromised information.  CORA utilizes the following tools: e-mail, IbC and Data  at  Rest.    Authority  is  derived  from  AFI  10-1701,  Command  and  Control  (C2)  for Cyberspace Operations. A2.2.  CDA Sortie and Event Definitions. A2.2.1.
