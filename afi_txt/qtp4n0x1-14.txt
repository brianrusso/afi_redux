These Qualification Training Packages (QTPs) were developed to enhance on-the-job training for Aerospace Medical Service Specialty personnel. As a trainer, the QTPs provide you with the breakdown of tasks into teachable elements. The teachable elements will help you to guide the trainee toward sufficient proficiency for task performance without assistance. QTPs are also used by the task certifiers/certification official to evaluate trainees concerning tasks which need third-party certification.  2.  Review each volume and identify which modules of QTPs are needed for the trainee’s job position. Core task items are identified with the number “5” on the STS Column 2; these items are the minimum mandatory skills which are required for all 4N0X1 personnel to be proficient in performing. You have the flexibility to arrange training for each module in the order that you decide.  3.  Review the subject-area tasks in each module with the trainee. Direct the trainee to review the training references to gain a better understanding of the objective for each module. If the trainee has any questions about the objective, clarify the behavior that is expected in the objective. Review the performance checklist with the trainee, and allow him/her sufficient time to learn each step (some objectives may take longer to teach). Remember--the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and to allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task without assistance.  4.  When the trainee receives sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation instructions. The performance checklist must be used as you evaluate each task objective. When the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document task completion appropriately in AFTR.  5.  The QTP task completion is to be annotated on AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, filed in Part 3, Section B in AFTR. NOTE: The individual checklists are not filed in each member’s AFTR. A master checklist is filed in Part 3, Section B of the hardcopy Master Training Plan (MTP) folder.  6. concerning each module with the trainee, and document appropriately in AFTR. As the trainer, when you are satisfied that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, he/she will be re-evaluated until the objective is met.  7. trainer first must ensure that the trainee is qualified to perform the task without assistance. Then the trainee will be evaluated by a task certifier/certifying official. The tasks which require third-party certification are denoted with a “^” in Column 3E of the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). After third-party certification, training qualification is documented appropriately in AFTR.  8.  The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing refresher/sustainment training. Such standardization will benefit the CFETP training concept throughout each member’s career. These documents also will be utilized for assessing/certifying the Aerospace Medical Service Specialist each time that he/she is assigned to a new duty position. The QTP developers’ goal is to publish a usable document for certifying officials, trainers, and trainees for the purpose of enhancing on-the-job training for Aerospace Medical Service Specialty personnel. We value your first-hand expertise, and we encourage your feedback. Direct all inquiries to:  If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas which need remediation. Conduct a feedback If the task which is being trained requires third-party certification by a task certifier/certifying official, the 383d TRAINING SQUADRON/TRR c/o 4N0X1 CDC WRITER/MANAGER 2931 Harney Rd, BLDG 903  Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 DSN: 420-5126 3 Volume 14 Module 1 ASSISTING WITH COLONOSCOPY/ASSISTING WITH HOT BIOPSY/ASSISTING WITH COLD SNARE/FORCEPS BIOPSY/POLYPECTOMY Gastroenterology.
