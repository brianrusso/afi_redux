(REVISE) Personnel in SARC, SAPR VA, or VVA positions require a favorably adjudicated Tier 2 (or higher-level) background investigation. (T-0). 2.2.1.1.2. (REVISE) Some SAPR personnel have national security eligibility and require a security clearance due to their Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), location and/or organizational requirements.  Each MAJCOM will determine those SAPR positions that have security clearance requirements. (T-2). 2.2.1.1.3. (REVISE) Tier 2 (or higher-level) background investigation must be favorably adjudicated before the D-SAACP application is submitted. (T-0). 2.2.1.1.4. (REVISE) Personnel filling SARC, SAPR VA, or VVA positions before the implementation of this instruction must have a favorably adjudicated Tier 2 (or higher-level) or higher background investigation no later than April 20, 2018. (T-0). 2.2.1.1.5. (DELETE) 2.3.3. (ADD) Wing Commanders may request a HHQ Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) as an opportunity to train, clarify policy intent, and assist in identifying potential resource constraints IAW AFI 90-201. The MAJCOM SARCs are responsible for continual evaluation of the SAPR program. Continual evaluation is a meaningful and timely feedback mechanism between process owners and the chain of command, Wing IGs, functional oversight agencies (MAJCOM, FOA, ANG, HAF Functional Managers, Centers), and MAJCOM IGs as a result of routine monitoring of Wing performance indicators.  MAJCOM SARCs will communicate performance indicators and areas of concern to the HQ AF SAPR Office and MAJCOM IGs to be included in the Risk Based Sampling Strategy (RBSS). (T-2). 2.3.3.1. (ADD) Careful planning is essential for a successful SAV/site visit.  Both the installation leadership and SAPR personnel should be clear about the purpose and that a site visit is distinctly different from an inspection or audit.  Depending on the length of the visit, the MAJCOM SARC should be able to view most aspects of the program.  Time required to execute the site visit will be determined at the MAJCOM level. (T-2). 2.3.3.2. (ADD) Site visits should serve multiple purposes for the MAJCOM SARC such as: 2.3.3.2.1. (ADD) Program Oversight.  Observe the location and availability of program and services.  If the SAPR office, for example, is located in a high traffic area MAJCOM SARCs can use this as an opportunity to discuss options to ensure privacy. (T-2). 2.3.3.2.2. (ADD) Mentoring.  The MAJCOM SARC can and should serve as a mentor for the installation SARCs; they should also encourage installation SARCs to collaborate with their      SAPR VAs to recruit “team leaders” from their more senior VVAs to also serve as coach/mentor to newly assigned VVAs. These types of relationships provide more leadership opportunities and give victim advocates the experience of additional support while providing a victim response. (T- 2). 2.3.3.2.3. (ADD) Training and Documentation.  Record keeping and documentation are vital to effective SAPR program management.  MAJCOM SARCs should assist installation SAPR personnel with creating continuity binders (hard copy or electronic) that are a valuable resource for capturing the history of individual and corporate efforts.  Continuity binders serve to: introduce program accomplishments to new employees and volunteers; provide a chronological history of how the program has developed; record stakeholders and key players; and provide the program managers a way of tracking if their efforts are in alignment with the AFI and resource management.  MAJCOM SARCs should observe installation SARCs performing DSAID data entry/data review, and provide training as necessary. (T-2). 2.3.3.2.4. (ADD) Support.  MAJCOM SARCs should provide feedback on specific or hypothetical case scenarios, and address state and local law concerns or issues that impact reporting.  This is also an opportunity to highlight promising practices and process improvements to enhance program services.  Where possible, MAJCOM SARCs should also accompany SARCs/SAPR VAs on routine visits, briefings, training, etc. (T-2). 2.3.3.2.5. (ADD) Program Visibility.  A key component of the SAPR Program is raising awareness, promoting program services and encouraging prevention.  The program must have effective visibility to encourage timely reporting. (T-2). 2.4.1.4.4. (REVISE) Each Reserve wing/organizations CC will appoint a Reserve SAPR Liaison (RSL) and an alternate RSL. (T-1).  The RSL and Alternate RSL will be a member of the reserve unit’s Physical Examination Section and have the ability to facilitate a Line of Duty (LOD) determinations. (T-1).  The RSL works closely with the installation SARC to ensure sexual assault victims are treated with dignity and respect throughout the LOD process. 2.4.2. (REVISE) Limiting career field eligibility for SARCs (Installation, Lead, Deputy, or Alternate) SAPR VAs or VVAs.  Due to the potential for legal, professional, or community conflicts of interest, the following members will not serve as SARCs, SAPR VAs or VVAs: individuals assigned as Violence Prevention Integrators (VPIs), formerly known as Specialist for the Primary Prevention of Violence (SPPV), individuals on G-series orders, first sergeants, chief master sergeants, individuals assigned with or working in law enforcement or investigations (to include administrative or training personnel assigned to Security Forces Squadron (SFS) or AFOSI), individuals assigned to the Office of the SJA, Special Victims’ Counsel or Area Defense Counsel, healthcare providers (as defined in DoDI 6495.02, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program Procedures, as those who have direct patient care), individuals assigned to EO offices, individuals assigned to the Office of the Wing Chaplain or equivalent, individuals assigned as firefighters, individuals assigned as emergency medical technicians, or individuals assigned to the Inspector General (IG). (T-1).           Chapter 3 Reporting Options, Eligibility, Procedures and Requirements 3.2.1.2. (REVISE) Service members’ dependents, 18 and older, who are eligible for treatment in the military health system (MHS), at installations in the continental United States (CONUS) and outside  of  the  continental  United  States  (OCONUS),  and  who  were  sexual  assault  victims perpetrated  by  someone  other  than  the  victim’s  spouse,  same  sex  domestic  partner,  and/or unmarried intimate partner. 3.2.1.4.1. (ADD) DoD civilian employees will have access to full SAPR services that are offered to Service members. (T-1).  This does not include additional medical entitlements or legal services to which they are not already authorized by law or policy. 3.5. (REVISE) Receiving Unrestricted Reports.  Any report of a sexual assault made by the victim through normal reporting channels, including the victim’s chain of command, law enforcement, and the AFOSI or other criminal investigative services is considered an unrestricted report.  If a victim elects this reporting option, a victim will not be permitted to change from unrestricted to a restricted report. (T-0). 3.5.2. (REVISE) Eligible victims requesting to make an unrestricted report and utilize SAPR services must do so using the DD Form 2910. (T-0). 3.8.1. (REVISE) Only one SAIRO Report is prepared per incident.  The immediate commander, defined  as the Squadron Commander (Sq/CC), Detachment Commander (Det/CC), HAF Director or civilian equivalent in coordination with the SARC and/or the MCIO, will prepare and submit the SAIRO Report. (T-0). Figure 3.1 provides the SAIRO Report responsibility matrix. 3.9. (REVISE) Commander’s (or Equivalent) Critical Information Requirement (CCIR).  The CCIR provides timely information to the Secretary of the Air Force, Under Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, AF/A1Z, and if necessary the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when a sexually based, alleged, or confirmed crime meets specific criteria.  This is a separate report from the SAIRO Report listed above and may be accomplished at the same time of the SAIRO Report if the criteria required for a CCIR is known, or later, as the criteria becomes apparent.  A CCIR is provided directly to AF Watch and their respective NAF/MAJCOM Commanders (also provide to Reserve NAF/MAJCOM Commanders for situational awareness for issues involving AFRC members) for submission as an OPREP-3 IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, and the current CSAF OPREP-3 Reporting Matrix, Rule 3D.  The installation or host wing commander will not complete CCIRs for restricted reports. (T-0). 3.9.1.3. (REVISE) The installation commander will provide the CCIR, via an unclassified encrypted NIPRNET email, directly to AF Watch and their respective NAF/MAJCOM Commanders for submission as an OPREP-3 IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, and the current CSAF OPREP-3 Reporting Matrix. (T-1).      Chapter 4 Prevention and Response for the Deployed Environment 4.1.1. (REVISE) For emerging operations, when practical, the Air Combat Command (ACC) SAPR Program Manager (PM) should coordinate development of any SARC requirements with AFPC/DPW and AF/A1Z.  The  ACC SAPR PM and AF/A1Z keep in mind the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) responsibility to ensure theater-wide support to Airmen in smaller units at potentially isolated sites, and determine if central or regional management can be effective. 4.1.2. (REVISE) The ACC SAPR PM, during transition to sustained operations, will account for future rotations and coordinate those requirements with AF/A1Z. (T-1).  AF/A1Z will ensure line remarks and overlap considerations are reviewed to ensure seamless exchange between outgoing and incoming SARCs and SAPR VAs. 4.1.3. (REVISE) The ACC SAPR PM for sustained operations, will provide functional oversight to ensure a continued response capability exists to support their AOR. (T-1). The ACC SAPR PM will perform duties that include, but are not limited to:        Chapter 7 SAPR Training 7.3.1.2. (REVISE) UTMs and UATMs will provide SARCs with annual training updates for their assigned installation, as requested. (T-1). 7.3.1.3. (REVISE) Commanders (Squadron and above) will track and document completion of annual SAPR training for a period of two years. (T-1). 7.4.1. (REVISE) Pre-deployment SAPR training is accomplished in the AOR within the newcomer’s briefing. (T-0). 7.4.2.1. (REVISE) Ensure annual SAPR training is completed once per calendar year.  Annual SAPR training will not be executed for deployed personnel while in the AOR. (T-0). 7.4.3. (DELETE). 7.4.4. (REVISE) Post-deployment SAPR training.  Members returning from deployment will receive a reintegration/post-deployment briefing (conducted by SAPR personnel) within 30 days of return. (T-0).    Chapter 9 Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database 9.2.1.  (REVISE) Only designated SARCs (Installation, Lead, Deputy and Alternate) and MAJCOM SARCs that have a favorably adjudicated Tier 2 (or higher-level) background investigation, are certified through the D-SAACP and have completed DSAID training shall be permitted access to DSAID. (T-0).    Chapter 10 Defense Sexual Assault Advocate Certification Program 10.1. (REVISE) The Defense Sexual Assault Advocate Certification Program (D-SAACP) ensures sexual assault victims are offered the assistance of a credentialed SARC, SAPR VA, and/or VVA who has a favorably adjudicated Tier 2 (or higher-level) background investigation.       Chapter 11 Expedited Transfer 11.4.1.9. (ADD) Once an ET is approved, the losing SARC will notify the gaining SARC if there is an open unrestricted case and continuation of services are required/requested, regardless of conditions under which the sexual assault victim is transferred or reassigned (e.g. PCS on or before normal rotation date, temporary assignment). (T-1).  If there is neither an open case nor continuation of services, no other action or notification is needed.  The losing SARC is responsible for ensuring the victim is informed of the SAPR resources at the new installation. 11.4.1.9.1. (ADD) For open cases, the losing SARC will obtain the victim’s written consent for continuation of support services when the victim PCS or is deployed, and document the victim’s response in the DSAID.  Written documentation of this election on the DD Form 2910 (Victim Reporting Preference Statement) is mandatory and must be uploaded into DSAID. (T-0).  The case will only be transferred in DSAID with the victim’s consent. 11.4.1.9.2. (ADD) If continued SAPR services are requested, transfer of the sexual assault case will be coordinated between the losing and gaining SARC, with the victim’s written consent, to ensure continuity of care. (T-0).  The losing SARC will notify the gaining SARC of the following: active criminal investigation, active legal proceeding, ongoing healthcare (medical or mental health) needs that are directly related to the sexual assault, e.g. ongoing monthly sexual assault CMG meeting oversight or active SAPR victim support services. 11.4.1.9.3. (ADD) If the transferring victim does not desire to continue services, but the case is still open, the losing SARC and sexual assault CMG will retain case management oversight responsibility until final disposition of the unrestricted case. (T-0).  The losing commander and SARC will keep the gaining commander and SARC updated on the disposition of the case.               Attachment 1 GLOSSARY OF REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION References (REVISE)  AFI 36-2909, Professional and Unprofessional Relationships, 1 May 1999 to reflect AFI 36-2909_AFGM2017-01, dated 13 March 2017 (REVISED)  AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection Program, 21 April 2015 to reflect AFI 90- 201_AFGM2017-0l, dated 26 January 2017 (ADD)  DoD Instruction 6495.03, Defense Sexual Assault Advocate Certification Program (D- SAACP), 10 September 2015 Abbreviations and Acronyms (ADD)  SAV – Staff Assistance Visit (ADD)  SPPV- Specialist for the Primary Prevention of Violence (ADD) VPI - Violence Prevention Integrators Terms (ADD) Maltreatment - Is a form of retaliation under this instruction, is treatment by peers or by other persons, that, when viewed objectively under all the circumstances, is abusive or otherwise unnecessary for any lawful purpose, that is done with the intent to discourage reporting of a criminal offense or otherwise discourage the due administration of justice, and that results in physical or mental harm or suffering, or reasonable could have caused, physical or mental harm or suffering.

Overview.  This  publication  establishes  guidance  and  procedures  for  the  Sexual  Assault Prevention  and  Response  (SAPR)  Program.  The  SAPR  Program  reinforces  the  Air  Force's commitment to prevention through the development, implementation and assessment of policies and programs to prevent and respond to sexual assault. These policies and programs are designed to  empower  Airmen  to  serve  as  catalysts  for  attitude  and  behavior  changes,  fostering  an environment  that  cultivates  a  culture  of  dignity,  mutual  respect  and  trust.  Furthermore,  the  Air Force is committed to introducing comprehensive prevention initiatives with continued focus on building both individual and community collaboration to promote social change. The Air Force's goal  is  to  provide  exemplary  support  throughout  victim  reporting,  response,  victim  advocacy, investigations and offender accountability when a sexual assault occurs. 1.2.  Applicability  and  Scope.  This  publication  supersedes  all  regulatory  and  policy  guidance within the Air Force not expressly mandated by law that is inconsistent with this instruction. If a Major  Command  (MAJCOM)/Direct  Reporting  Unit  (DRU)/Field  Operating  Agency  (FOA), Installation or Wing supplements this instruction, a copy of the supplement must be approved by AF/CVS (T-0).  1.3.  Definitions.  Terms used in this Instruction are defined in Attachment 1.  1.4.  Policy.  Sexual  assault  is  criminal  conduct  that  violates  the  standards  the  United  States  of America expects of its men and women serving in the Air Force and is inconsistent with the Air Force core values: Integrity First, Service Before Self and Excellence in All We Do. Inherent in these  core  values  is  respect:  self-respect,  mutual  respect,  and  respect  for  the  Air  Force  as  an institution. It is Air Force policy that: 1.4.1.  Airmen  will  strive  to  eliminate  sexual  assault  by  fostering  a  culture  of  dignity  and mutual  respect  among  Air  Force  members  and  provide  environments  free  of  sexual harassment and assault.  1.4.2.  The SAPR Program will provide education and training to all our military and civilian members  throughout  their  Air  Force  careers,  to  prevent  sexual  assault,  enhance  response capability, establish victim support, encourage victims to come forward and hold perpetrators of this crime appropriately accountable. 1.4.3.  A  trained  and  immediate  sexual  assault  response  capability  from  a  Sexual  Assault Response  Coordinator  (SARC),  Sexual  Assault  Prevention  and  Response  Victim  Advocate (SAPR VA), or Volunteer Victim Advocate (VVA) will be available 24 hours a day, 7 days per  week,  for  all  locations  including  deployed  areas  (T-0).  For  each  sexual  assault  report, when  SAPR  assistance  is  requested,  the  individual  providing  the  response  (SARC,  SAPR VA,  and/or  VVA)  will  ensure  victims  are  protected,  treated  with  dignity  and  respect,  and receive  timely  access  to  appropriate  medical  treatment  and  services  (T-0).  For  reporting option eligibility see chapter 3. 1.4.3.1.  The  terms  SARC  and  SAPR  VA  as  defined  in  DoD  Directive  6495.01  Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program are used as standard terms throughout 8 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 the  Air  Force  (AF)  to  facilitate  communications  and  transparency  regarding  SAPR capacity. 1.4.4.  Installation  SARCs  shall  have  direct,  unimpeded  access  to  both  the  immediate commanders of eligible victim(s) and alleged Service member offender(s), as needed.  They will  also  be  supervised  by  the  installation  or  host  Wing  Commander  (WG/CC)  (or equivalent)  IAW  DoDI  6495.02,  Sexual  Assault  Prevention  and  Response  Program Procedures (T-0). The installation or host wing commander may delegate this responsibility, in  writing,  to  the  Vice  Wing  Commander  (WG/CV)  (or  equivalent)  but  will  not  delegate  it further (T-1). 1.4.4.1.  SARCs, SAPR VAs and VVAs will be  protected  from  coercion  (see  glossary), retaliation,  ostracism  (see  glossary),  discrimination,  maltreatment  (see  glossary)  and reprisal  (see  glossary) related to  the execution of their SAPR duties and responsibilities (T-0). 1.4.4.2.  If an installation has 3 or more SARCs, a Lead SARC shall be designated by the installation  or  host  wing  commander  in  coordination  with  the  MAJCOM  SARC  (T-0).The  installation  or  host  wing  commander  will  provide  an  appointment  letter  to  the MAJCOM SARC identifying the Lead SARC for the installation (T-2). For Lead SARC responsibilities  see  chapter  2  with  further  guidance  for  Joint  Base  (JB)  Lead  SARCs  in chapter 12. 1.4.5.  Installation  SAPR  personnel  (SARCs/SAPR  VA/VVAs)  will  assist  all  sexual  assault victims  as  prescribed  in  Chapter  3,  regardless  of  Service  affiliation  or  status  (T-0).  If  the nature of the victim’s and alleged offender’s relationship excludes the sexual assault from the SAPR program  (see section 3.2.), the SARC’s assistance is  limited to  arranging emergency medical  care  and  the  opportunity  to  receive  a  Sexual  Assault  Forensic  Exam  (SAFE)  and mandatory referral of the victim to the Family Advocacy Program (FAP). See chapter 3 for additional guidance 1.4.6.  SARCs  shall  serve  as  the  single  point  of  contact  for  coordinating  care  for  sexual assault  victims,  to  whom  this  instruction  applies,  ensuring  they  receive  appropriate  and responsive  care  (T-0).  All  SARCs  are  authorized  to  perform  victim  advocate  duties  and perform those duties as outlined in Chapter 2 of this instruction. 1.4.7.  All sexual assault victims shall be given priority and treated as emergency cases (T-0). Commanders and emergency care providers will ensure victims receive emergency medical care  and  the  opportunity  to  receive  a  Sexual  Assault  Forensic  Exam  (SAFE)  (T-0).  The victim  shall  be  advised  that  even  if  a  SAFE  is  declined,  they  are  encouraged  (but  not mandated) to receive medical care, psychological care, and victim advocacy (T-0). 1.4.8.  The  enlistment  and  commissioning  of  personnel  into  the  Air  Force  who  have  a qualifying conviction (see Glossary) for a sexual assault crime is prohibited. No waivers are authorized. 1.4.9.  The Air Force SAPR Program will:  1.4.9.1.

The  appropriate immediate commander, either victim’s or subject’s, will prepare and submit a Sexual Assault Incident  Response  Oversight  (SAIRO)  Report  within  8  days,  in  accordance  with  the procedures  provided  in  Chapter  3  (T-0).  If  the  SARC  is  unavailable,  the  Deputy  SARC, Alternate SARC, or SAPR VA, respectively, makes the notification.  1.4.10.1.  To  complete  the  SAIRO,  the  8-day  timeframe  begins  when  the  unrestricted report  is  made  to  a  SARC  or  SAPR  VA  and  the  SARC  or  SAPR  VA  completes  a  DD Form  2910,  Victim  Report  Preference  Statement,  for  the  unrestricted  report.  If  an independent investigation is initiated, then the requirement for the SAIRO report and the trigger  for  the  8-day  timeframe  begins  when  the  Military  Criminal  Investigative Organization (MCIO) notifies the immediate commander of the victim or subject. The 8-day  timeframe  ends  when  the  first  general/flag  officer  (G/FO)  in  the  victim’s  and/or subject’s chain of command receives the SAIRO Report. 1.4.11.  Commanders  and  personnel  with  information  of  a  serious  threat  of  a  person  (to include  a  threat  to  life)  will  be  immediately  reported  to  the  Air  Force  Office  of  Special Investigations (AFOSI) and/or local law enforcement (T-0).  1.4.12.

Military VVAs must be E-4 and above and at least 21 years of age for enlisted and a minimum of O-2 for officers; however officers in the grade of  O-1  that  were  prior  enlisted  are  eligible  to  become  VVAs  (T-1).  VVAs  that  hold  a current  D-SAACP  credentialing,  prior  to  the  date  of  this  instruction,  are  grandfathered into the program and may remain as VVAs.  AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 39 2.8.1.2.  Civilian VVAs must have their supervisors document their volunteer status and duties,  to  include  hours  performing  VA  duties,  in  their  personnel  files  consistent  with current  procedures  managed  by  the  Civilian  Personnel  Office  (T-1).  Civilian  VVAs  are expected  to  maintain  acceptable  performance  in  their  non-VVA  job.  A  record  of unacceptable performance by their primary supervisor results in the employee no longer participating as a VVA until their work is acceptable. 2.8.1.3.  All  VVAs  must  comply  with  initial  and  ongoing  screening  requirements  as prescribed in 2.2. (T-0). 2.8.1.4.  In order to ensure continuity of care for the AF Reserve and ANG components, victim advocacy may continue through the victim’s changes in status at the discretion of the victim’s AF Reserve or ANG units. 2.8.1.5.  Eligible personnel who are interested in volunteering must submit and complete the following requirements:   2.8.1.5.1.  Sign and have their supervisor and commander (or equivalent) sign the DD Form 2950 (T-0). 2.8.1.5.2.  Schedule an interview with the SARC and SAPR VA (T-1).  2.8.1.5.3.  Complete  VVA  application  and  screening  criteria  before  attending  initial VA training (T-1).  2.8.1.5.4.  By signing the volunteer application, the volunteer agrees to submit to all necessary screening criteria.  2.8.1.5.5.  Attend the initial 40-hour VA training (T-0). 2.8.1.5.5.1.  D-SAACP  application  is  completed  only  when  the  VVA  has completed the initial 40-hour VA training.  2.8.1.5.5.2.  Once a VVA receives their D-SAACP certification, the VVA will be given  a Special  Experience  Identifier  (SEI)  (T-1). Officers  will receive the code 0V and enlisted receive the code 003 (T-1). The SARC will document the training on  the  AF  Form  2096,  sign  the  form  and  submit  it  to  the  Military  Personnel Section (T-1).   2.8.1.5.5.3.  If  a  VVA  is  not  D-SAACP  certified,  does  not  possess  a  current certification, or the certification has been revoked, the SARC will submit an AF Form  2096  to  the  installation  or  host  wing  commander  to  sign  and  submit  the Military Personnel Section to remove the SEI code from the individual (T-1). 2.8.2.  The SARC will ensure all VVA documents are kept, either hard copy or electronic, in individual  VVA  folders  (T-1).  The  SARC  will  secure  and  maintain  hard  copy  folders  in  a secured lockable file cabinet in the SAPR office (T-1). 2.8.3.  When a VVA is performing advocacy duties, he or she reports directly to the SARC; however, no change of rater is initiated. The SARC has sole discretion to decide whether an individual will serve as a VVA based on their advocacy role (T-3).  40 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 2.8.3.1.  Annually, the SARC will meet with the VVA’s primary supervisor (T-3). If the VVA’s  role  is  negatively  impacting  duty  performance,  the  SARC  and  supervisor  will formally remove the member until their level of work is acceptable (T-3). 2.8.3.2.  If at any time the VVA does not meet the required screening criteria to remain a VVA,  the  SARC  will  notify  the  primary  supervisor  to  ensure  that  advocacy  duties  are moved from the volunteer’s position description (T-1).  2.8.3.3.  The  SARC  will  refer  disciplinary  and  adverse  actions  to  the  employee's supervisor for appropriate action (T-1). 2.8.4.  VVAs will not act as a mental health provider or an investigator (T-0).  2.8.5.  VVAs will obtain and maintain a Government driver’s license,  as determined by the WG/CC (T-3). 2.9.  VVA Duties and Responsibilities.  VVAs will: 2.9.1.  Comply  with  D-SAACP  requirements;  this  includes  the  completing  initial  40-hour training,  taught  by  SARC  and  SAPR  VA,  and  obtaining  32  continuing  education  units (CEUs) of refresher training every two years (T-0).  2.9.2.  Be on-call, reachable, and available to respond timely, but safely, when scheduled for duty  by  the  SARC  or  SAPR  VA  and  report  to  the  SARC  while  carrying  out  sexual  assault advocacy responsibilities (T-1). 2.9.2.1.  VVAs  will  not  respond  to  a  victim,  under  any  circumstances,  if  under  the influence of alcohol or drugs (T-1).  2.9.2.2.  VVAs  will  not  transport  a  sexual  assault  victim,  under  any  circumstances,  in their privately owned vehicle (T-1). 2.9.2.3.  If  at  any  point  the  VVA  is  assigned  a  project  or  critical  work  by  their  primary supervisor  preventing  the  availability  of  an  immediate  response,  the  VVA  must  contact the  SARC  or  SAPR  VA  to  be  temporarily  removed  from  the  on-call  roster  until  the project is complete (T-3). 2.9.3.  Upon notification and or assignment from the SARC or SAPR VA, respond, conduct a non-clinical safety assessment and provide assistance to a report of sexual assault (T-0).  2.9.4.

VVAs will not provide counseling (T-0).  2.9.9.  Meet  with  the  victim  as  soon  as  possible  and  provide  the  victim  information  on  the sexual assault response process, unrestricted reporting and the option of restricted reporting if not already accomplished by the SARC or SAPR VA (T-0).  2.9.10.  Inform  the  victim  of  available  healthcare  to  include  the  option  of  a  SAFE  for  the collection and preservation of evidence (T-0). 2.9.11.  Provide the SARC or SAPR VA all information on incidents the VVA responds to as soon  as  practicable  after  the  incident,  and  provide  all  pertinent  paperwork  to  the  SARC  or SAPR VA the following duty day (T-0). The installation SARC or SAPR VA will establish specific response requirements (T-3).  2.9.12.  Be  prepared  and  available  to  travel,  IAW  the  Joint  Travel  Regulation,  when requested to provide support if a victim is traveling for Article 32 and/or court proceedings (T-0). 2.9.13.  If a civilian VVA, submit appropriate compensatory time (T-1). 2.9.14.  When facilitating transportation for victims: 2.9.14.1.  VVAs  will  not  transport  a  victim  in  their  privately  owned  vehicle  (T-1). Transportation through  government transportation.  individually  by is  acquired the  victim  or 2.9.14.2.

When transporting a victim, a third person is encouraged to ride in the vehicle. If the SARC, SAPR VA or VVA is of the opposite gender of the victim for transport, a third individual is  required for transport  (T-1). The third party will be certified through D-SAACP or a person specifically requested by the victim (T-1). 2.9.15.  Advise  victims  who  report/reported  a  sexual  assault  or  seek/sought  mental  health treatment  for  a  sexual  assault  that  they  have/will  have  the  opportunity  discuss  any concerns/issues  related  to  the  impact  of  that  reporting  or  treatment  on  their  military  career with a G/FO (T-0). 2.10.  Training and Special Experience Identifier (SEI) Codes. 2.10.1.  Training and SEI codes are established to identify and track the specialized training, experience and certification required for SARCs, SAPR VAs and VVAs, and to match these uniquely qualified Airmen to specific duties. 2.10.2.  All  SARCs,  SAPR  VAs  and  VVAs  will  receive  an  SEI  code  after  successful completion  of  the  AF  SARC,  SAPR  VA  or  VVA  course  and  credentialing  through  D-SAACP (T-1).  42 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 2.10.2.1.  Active Duty military personnel, AF Reserve, ANG personnel, and AF civilian SARCs  (Full-time  or  alternate)  and  SAPR  VAs  who  have  completed  the  AF  SARC course or the NGB equivalent and are D-SAACP credentialed will receive a training code QBX (T-1). Military SARCs will have their record updated to reflect a SEI code Y0Y (T-1).  2.10.2.2.  Following successful VVA training and D-SAACP credentialing completion of military officer VVAs will receive a SEI code 0V and enlisted VVAs receive a SEI code 003 (T-1). The SARC will ensure the training is documented on AF Form 2096, signed, and submitted to the Military Personnel Section (T-1). 2.10.2.3.  SARCs, SAPR VAs and VVAs will retain the training or SEI code if they have maintained  certification  through  D-SAACP  or  their  credentials  have  not  been  revoked (T-1).  2.10.2.3.1.  SARCs  will  remove  the  SEI  code  if  the  SAPR  VA  or  VVA  does  not possess a current D-SAACP certification (T-1). The SARC will submit an AF Form 2096  to  the  Military  Personnel  Section  to  remove  the  SEI  code  from  the  individual (T-1).  2.10.2.3.2.  The  installation  or  host  wing  commander  (or  equivalent)  will  remove  a SARCs SEI code using an AF Form 2096 if the SARC does not maintain a current D-SAACP certification (T-1). AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 43 Chapter 3 REPORTING OPTIONS, ELIGIBILITY, PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS 3.1.  Reporting  Options.  The  Air  Force  is  committed  to  ensuring  sexual  assault  victims  are protected, treated with dignity and respect, and provided support, advocacy, and care. To achieve these  objectives,  the  Air  Force  has  two  reporting  options:  unrestricted  and  restricted  reporting, reference AF/CVS Sharepoint for additional guidance.  3.1.1.  An  unrestricted  report  of  sexual  assault  activates  victim  services  and  accountability responses  that  are  essential  to  eliminating  this  crime.  However,  in  some  cases  unrestricted reporting may represent  a barrier for victims to  access  services, when the victim desires no command or Air Force law enforcement involvement.  3.1.2.  Commanders (or equivalent) and leaders need to be aware of concerns that may deter a victim from making an unrestricted report. The most common concerns are:  3.1.2.1.  Lack of privacy and confidentiality; 3.1.2.2.  Stigma and shame based on the nature of the crime; 3.1.2.3.  Fear  of  being  reduced  (i.e.  appear  as  weak  or  less  competent)  in  the  eyes  of one’s commander (or equivalent) or colleagues; 3.1.2.4.  Fear of disciplinary action due to collateral misconduct; 3.1.2.5.  Fear of re-victimization; 3.1.2.6.  Fear  of  operational  impacts  on  training  status,  security  clearance,  and deployment; 3.1.2.7.  Fear of adverse impact on the unit or mission;  3.1.2.8.  Fear of harassment or reprisal from commanders (or equivalent) or colleagues.  3.1.3.  DoD  has  directed  the  implementation  of  confidentiality  in  the  form  of  a  restricted reporting  option.  This  reporting  option  is  intended  to  remove  barriers  to  medical  care  and support  while  giving  the  victim  additional  time  and  increased  control  over  the  release  and management of personal information. 3.1.3.1.  Restricted  reporting  will  impact  investigations  and  the  ability  of  the  offender’s commander (or equivalent) to hold the alleged offender accountable. However, such risks do  not  outweigh  the  overall  interest  in  providing  a  restricted  reporting  option  to  sexual assault victims.  3.1.3.2.  Commanders  and  SAPR  personnel  will  maintain  the  confidentiality  of  the medical  information,  regardless  of  whether  the  victim  elects  restricted  or  unrestricted reporting (T-0). 3.1.3.3.  Allegations of assault in violation of Article 128, UCMJ are not governed by this AFI. 3.1.3.3.1.  Consult  with  the  staff  judge  advocate,  as  required,  for  clarification  and guidance concerning whether a report concerns an allegation of sexual assault. 44 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 3.2.  Reporting Option Eligibility. 3.2.1.  The following individuals are eligible for both the unrestricted and restricted reporting option from the SAPR Program: 3.2.1.1.  Active Duty members who were sexual assault victims perpetrated by someone other  than  the  victim’s  spouse,  same  sex  domestic  partner,  and/or  unmarried  intimate partner. 3.2.1.1.1.  Military  members,  who  are  active  Duty,  but  who  were  sexual  assault victims  prior  to  enlistment  or  commissioning,  are  eligible  to  receive  SAPR  services under either reporting option. Support to an Active Duty Service member is available regardless of when or where the sexual assault took place.  3.2.1.1.1.1.  Prior-to-military  service  victimization  includes  adult  sexual  assault (including stranger sexual assault and intimate partner sexual assault, if the victim is  no  longer  in  the  same  intimate  relationship)  and  sexual  assault  that  was perpetrated on the military member while he or she was still a child. 3.2.1.1.1.2.  Reports of prior-to-military service sexual assault will be handled in accordance with the procedures for restricted and unrestricted reports outlined in this  instruction,  as  appropriate  based  on  the  type  of  report  made  (restricted  or unrestricted) (T-0). 3.2.1.2.  Active Duty members’ dependents, 18 and older, who are eligible for treatment in  the  military  health  system  (MHS),  at  installations  in  the  continental  United  States (CONUS) and outside of the continental United States (OCONUS), and who were sexual assault victims perpetrated by someone other than the victim’s spouse, same sex domestic partner, and/or unmarried intimate partner. 3.2.1.3.  AF  Reserve  and  ANG  members  in  Title  10  status  who  are  sexually  assaulted when performing active service and Inactive Duty Training will be eligible to receive full SAPR  support  services  from  a  SARC,  SAPR  VA,  and  VVA  and  the  appropriate  non-medical  referrals  (T-0).  AF Reserve and ANG members, who file a report regarding an accused,  subject  to  the  UCMJ,  have  access  to  a  Special  Victims’  Counsel  (SVC)  upon request. Reports of prior-to-military service sexual assault shall be handled in accordance with the procedures for restricted and unrestricted reports outlined in this instruction, as appropriate based on the type of report made (restricted or unrestricted). AF Reserve and ANG members can report at  any time, and do not  have to  wait to  be performing  active service or be in inactive duty training to file their report. 3.2.1.3.1.  Reserve  members  to  include  Air  Reserve  Technicians  (ART)  and  ANG members  reporting  a  sexual  assault  that  occurred  prior  to  or  while  not  performing active service or Inactive Duty Training (IDT), are eligible to  receive limited SAPR support  services  (see  glossary)  from  a  SARC,  SAPR  VA,  and/or  VVA.  Local  laws and regulations apply for ANG members in Title 32 status. 3.2.1.4.  AF  civilian  employees,  both  appropriated  and  non-appropriated,  who  were sexual  assault  victims  perpetrated  by  someone  other  than  the  victim’s  spouse,  same sex domestic partner, and/or unmarried intimate partner. AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 45 3.2.2.  The following non-military individuals are only eligible for the unrestricted reporting option and to receive emergency medical services at a MTF, if offered at a MTF, at no cost, unless that individual is otherwise eligible as a Service member or TRICARE beneficiary: 3.2.2.1.  DoD civilian employee’s dependents 18 years of age and older when they are stationed or performing duties OCONUS. 3.2.2.2.  U.S.  citizen  DoD  contractor  personnel  when  authorized  to  accompany  the Armed  Forces  in  a  contingency  operation  OCONUS  and  their  employees  who  are  U.S. citizens.  3.2.3.  Regardless  of  the  eligibility  to  be  able  to  make  an  unrestricted  or  restricted  report, everyone (civilian or military), regardless of nationality or military affiliation have the ability to report a sexual assault or other criminal activity to AFOSI. 3.2.4.  The  Family  Advocacy  Program  (FAP)  manages  sexual  assault  allegations  when the alleged  offender  is the partner  in context of  a spousal  relationship, same  sex domestic partnership, unmarried intimate partner relationship, or military dependents who are 17 years  of age  and  younger  IAW  AFI  40-301,  Family  Advocacy.  If  any  of  the  following  four indicators are met, the sexual assault is considered intimate partner violence and is referred to the FAP and is outside the scope of this Instruction, no exception (T-0): 3.2.4.1.  The  victim  is  or  has  been  married  to  the  alleged  offender.  Spouse  sexual assault cases present unique risk factors which must be referred and managed by the FAP. 3.2.4.2.  The victim and alleged offender have a child or children together.  3.2.4.3.  The victim lives or has lived with the alleged offender and is (was) engaged in a sexually intimate relationship (i.e., couple engaged  in sexual intercourse or other sexual acts in the course of a romantic relationship).   3.2.4.4.  The  victim  is  a  military  dependent  17  years  of  age  and  younger  (excludes Service members that are 17 years old). 3.2.5.  The  SARC  and  installation  FAP  provider  discuss  SAPR  referrals  that  fall  under 3.2.6.1.  to  assess  for  the  potential  for  ongoing  violence  within  24  hours  of  the  victim reporting the incident to the SARC. 3.2.6.  If a potential for ongoing violence exists the SARC and FAP explain to the victim that this risk requires the case be referred to FAP. The SARC and FAP will also ensure the victim is immediately aware of all services available to help him(her) and understands the concept of informed consent that enables the victim to include anyone (for example, an SVC, friend, family member, co-worker, chaplain) they choose in appointments regarding their assault (T-1).  Note,  however,  that  only  communications  with  an  SVC  or  chaplain  are  privileged  and protected  by  law.  The  SARC  and  FAP  will  ensure  the  victim  understands  that  he(she)  can adjust/modify  his(her)  consent  to  these  participants  as  he(she)  feels  necessary/  comfortable throughout  the  process  without  the  fear  of  losing  access  or  support  from  any  supporting entity (T-1). 46 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 3.2.6.1.  The following cases that initially report to SAPR personnel are referred to FAP for services: 3.2.6.1.1.  If  the  victim  is  in  an  ongoing  relationship  with  the  alleged  offender  and prior  to  the  incident  they  engaged  in  sexual  intercourse  or  other  sexual  acts  in  the course of a romantic relationship or there is a demonstrated potential for an ongoing relationship.   3.2.6.1.2.  If  the  alleged  offender  has  engaged  or  is  engaging  in  stalking  behaviors (e.g.,  including  but  not  limited  to,  showing  up  in  places  that  are  otherwise  not expected  that  the  victim  is  at,  following  the  victim,  texting,  calling,  contacting friends,  co-workers  or  family,  driving  by  a  residence  or  work,  Global  Positioning System tracking, social networking tracking, tracking whereabouts through friends or co-workers, bullying and manipulation). 3.2.6.1.3.  If  the  victim  chooses  not  to  engage  in  FAP  services  (for  cases  outlined under 3.2.6.1.) at the time of reporting, the victim can choose SARC services but the CMG must be informed of the safety risks with the victim and ensure a safety plan is coordinated by the SARC with the victim (T-1).  3.2.6.2.  The  SARC  will  only  enter  the  case  into  DSAID  when  FAP  is  not  taking  the sexual  assault  incident  to  the  Central  Registry  Board  to  avoid  a  double  count  of  sexual assault cases (T-1).  3.2.7.  Prior to service victimization (including adult sexual assault by an intimate partner if the victim is no longer in the same intimate relationship) are eligible to receive SAPR services under either reporting option. 3.2.8.  The  Equal  Opportunity  office  (EO)  manages  all  sexual  harassment  claims.  A SARC who receives a sexual harassment claim will refer it to EO (T-0). 3.3.  Receiving Restricted Reports. 3.3.1.  Only SARCs, SAPR VAs, VVAs, and Healthcare Personnel will receive restricted reports  of  sexual  assault  (T-0).  Healthcare  personnel,  to  include  psychiatrists,  clinical psychologists and clinical social workers who receive a restricted report will immediately call a SARC, SAPR VA, or VVA to ensure that a victim is offered SAPR services and so that a DD Form 2910 can be completed  (T-1). If a victim elects this reporting option, a victim  may  convert  a  restricted  report  to  an  unrestricted  report  at  any  time.  The conversion  to  an  unrestricted  report  will  be  documented  with  a  signature  by  the  victim and  the  signature  of  the  SARC  or  SAPR  VA  in  the  appropriate  block  on  the  DD  Form 2910 (T-0). 3.3.1.1.  If  a  report  is  made  to  a  SARC,  SAPR  VA,  VVA,  or  Healthcare  Personnel, and it cannot reasonably be ascertained whether the report is intended to be restricted, such a report (or visit to the MTF) will be treated as restricted, to the greatest extent possible, until the SARC can ascertain the victim’s eligibility and intentions through the DD Form 2910 reporting options. A report can be made to healthcare personnel, but healthcare personnel will immediately contact the SARC or SAPR VA to fill out the  DD  Form  2910  (T-0).  Chaplains  and  military  attorneys  cannot  take  official reports (T-0). AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 47 3.3.1.1.1.  Unless a DD Form 2910 is filed with a SARC, a report to a Chaplain or military attorney may not result in the rendering of SAPR services or investigative action because of the privileges associated with  speaking to  these individuals.  A Chaplain or military attorney should advise the victim to consult with a SARC to understand the full scope of services available or facilitate contact with a SARC, with victim’s consent. 3.3.1.1.2.  If an AF civilian, appropriated and non-appropriated, decide to make a report,  the  victim  will  do  so  utilizing  the  DD  Form  2910.  The  victim  will  be informed  during  the  explanation  of  services  on  the  DD  Form  2910  that  legal representation by the SVC program depends upon statutory authorities and will be determined at the time of the request (T-0). The victim will be informed, further, that  AF  civilian  employees  are  not  eligible  for  non-emergency  medical  services from  a  MTF  unless  the  individual  reporting  is  otherwise  a  beneficiary  (retiree, reserve component  member, dependent,  etc.)  (T-0). Furthermore, the victim will be informed that AF civilian employees are not eligible for a permanent change of station to another installation as an expedited transfer (T-0). The commander may work with the victim, SARC and local civilian personnel office to determine if the individual can be detailed to a different work center to promote victim recovery.  3.3.1.2.  If  a  victim  tells  someone  (e.g.,  roommate,  friend,  family  member)  that  a sexual  assault  has  occurred,  their  communication  does  not  require  the  individual  to report the incident and does not necessarily prevent the victim from later electing to make  a  restricted  report.  However,  if  the  person  to  whom  the  victim  confided  the information  (e.g.,  roommate,  friend,  family  member)  is  in  the  victim’s  chain  of command, a member of DoD law enforcement, or reports the events to command or law  enforcement,  the  victim  cannot  make  a  restricted  report.  It  is  permissible  for  a roommate,  friend,  or  family  member  to  not  report  the  incident  when  the  victim  has expressed to that individual that he or she wishes the report to remain restricted. Air Force  Instructors,  with  exception  of  USAFA  instructors,  are  considered  part  of  the supervisory  chain  (e.g.  Officer  Training  School,  Squadron  Officer  School,  Basic Military  Training,  Senior  Noncommissioned  Officer  Academy,  Airmen  Leadership School, First Term Airmen Course, etc.). 3.3.1.2.1.  While  a  sexual  assault  victim  may  disclose  information  to  whomever he or she chooses, an official report is made only when a DD Form 2910 is signed and  filed  with  a  SARC  or  SAPR  VA,  or  when  a  MCIO  investigator  initiates  an investigation. 3.3.1.3.  A  VVA  who  is  contacted  by  a  victim  wishing  to  make  a  restricted  report  but who  has  not  been  assigned  by  the  SARC  or  SAPR  VA  to  serve  as  the  VVA  for  that individual will not enter into a discussion of the circumstances but immediately refers the victim to the SARC (T-1). The VVA will not report the initial contact to command or law enforcement officials (T-1). legal  assistance  attorneys  and  SVCs  entitled 3.3.1.4.  Chaplains, to  privileged communications will not accept a restricted report of sexual assault (T-0). However in the course of otherwise privileged communications with chaplains, legal assistance attorneys and SVCs,  a victim may indicate that he or she wishes to  file a restricted report.  If this 48 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 occurs,  the  chaplains,  legal  assistance  attorneys  and  SVCs  will  facilitate  contact  with  a SARC, SAPR VA, or VVA to ensure that a victim is offered SAPR services and so that a DD Form 2910 can be completed (T-0). If a victim chooses not to file a restricted report after  disclosing  a  sexual  assault  in  an  otherwise  privileged  communication,  the communication remains confidential. 3.3.1.5.  If  a  victim  tells  Healthcare  Personnel  that  a  sexual  assault  has  occurred,  the Healthcare Personnel will notify the SARC, or in cases of domestic abuse or child abuse, the  FAP  (T-1).  Per  DoD  6025.18-R,  DoD  Health  Information  Privacy  Regulation, pertinent protected health information from the victim's medical records may be released to  the  SARC  without  the  consent  of  the  victim.  Such  release,  however,  requires appropriate  accounting  IAW  Chapter  13  of  the  regulation.  Medical  providers  will  not disclose or provide actual medical records to the SARC (T-0). 3.3.1.6.  Under MRE 514, a victim has the right to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing a confidential communication between a victim and a SAPR VA or VVA, in a case arising under the UCMJ, if such communication is made for the purpose of facilitating advice or supportive assistance to the victim. For further guidance and questions regarding MRE 514 contact your servicing staff judge advocate. 3.3.1.7.  If a victim approaches a SARC, SAPR VA, VVA, or Healthcare Personnel and begins to make a report, but then changes his or her mind and leaves without signing the DD Form 2910 (where the reporting option is selected), the SARC, SAPR VA, or VVA will  not  inform  investigators  or  commanders  (or  equivalent)  about  this  report  and  does not produce the report or disclose the communications surrounding the report (T-1). The SARC  will  not  enter  the  information  into  DSAID  and  nor  submit  a  SAIRO  (T-0).  If commanders  (or  equivalent)  or  law  enforcement  ask  about  the  report,  disclosures  can only be made IAW exceptions to the MRE 514 privilege. 3.4.  Exceptions and Confidential Disclosures of a Restricted Report. 3.4.1.  A  SARC,  SAPR  VA,  VVA,  or  Healthcare  Personnel  who  has  received  a  restricted report  will  be  prohibited  from  disclosing  any  covered  communications  pertaining  to  the sexual  assault  to  any  law  enforcement  official,  command  authority,  or  other  entity  not authorized to receive restricted reports (T-0). 3.4.2.  Disclosures  of  covered  communications.  Persons  will  access communications  will  only  disclose  covered  communications  under circumstances:  to  covered the  following 3.4.2.1.  Authorized by the victim in writing (T-0). 3.4.2.2.  Necessary  to  prevent  or  lessen  a  serious  and  imminent  threat  to  the  health  or safety  of  the  victim,  to  include  harm  to  self  or  another  person  (T-0).  For  example,  a SARC receives multiple reports involving the same alleged suspect (repeat offender) may meet these criteria.  3.4.2.3.  Required  for  fitness  for  duty  or  disability  determinations  (T-0).  This disclosure  is  limited  to  only  the  information  necessary  to  process  duty  or  disability determinations.  Disclosure  of  a  restricted  report  under  these  circumstances  does  not AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 49 change the nature of the victim’s restricted report, nor does it create an obligation for reporting to law enforcement or command for investigation. 3.4.2.4.  Disclosure to a SARC, SAPR VA, VVA, or Healthcare Personnel when required for the supervision and/or coordination of direct victim treatment or services (T-0). 3.4.2.5.  Ordered  by  a  Military,  Federal,  or  State judge  to  a  military  or  civilian  court  of competent jurisdiction (T-0). 3.4.2.6.  Required  by  officials  or  entities  as  required  by  Federal  or  State  statute  or applicable U.S. international agreement (T-0).  3.4.3.  The  SARC  will  evaluate  the  confidential  information  provided  under  restricted reporting to determine whether an exception applies (T-0). 3.4.3.1.  The  SARC  will  consult  with  the  servicing  SJA,  using  non-identifying  personal information,  to  determine  whether  the  exception  applies  (T-0).  The  SARC  will  consult with  their  MAJCOM  SARC  for  guidance  as  to  whether  disclosure  is  appropriate  under this  policy  (T-1).  When  there  is  uncertainty  or  disagreement  on  whether  disclosure  is appropriate,  the  matter  is  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  installation  or  host  wing commander who will make a decision using non-identifying personal information (T-1). 3.4.3.1.1.  Until those determinations are made, only non-identifying information should  be  provided  to  individuals  not  authorized  to  receive  confidential communications.  3.4.3.1.2.  The SJA, or other legal  advisor concerned, will analyze the impact  of MRE 514 on any authorized or unauthorized disclosure of communication (T-0). 3.4.3.2.  Unauthorized  disclosure  of  a  confidential  communication,  improper  release  of medical information, and other violations of this AFI may result in administrative action, including loss of medical credentials, or action under the UCMJ. 3.4.3.2.1.  SARCs will immediately notify the installation or host wing commander of any inadvertent unauthorized disclosure of a confidential communication (T-1). 3.4.3.2.2.  If  a  SAPR  VA,  VVA,  or  Healthcare  Personnel  makes  an  inadvertent, unauthorized disclosure of a confidential communication, the SARC will be notified (T-1). 3.4.3.2.3.  The SARC will notify the victim of the inadvertent disclosure and review the process or circumstance that led to the unauthorized disclosure (T-0).  3.4.3.2.3.1.  Unauthorized  disclosures  have  no  impact  on  the  status  of  the restricted  report.  All  restricted  reporting  information  is  still  confidential  and protected. Unauthorized or inadvertent  disclosures made to  a commander  (or equivalent),  supervisor  or  law  enforcement  will  result  in  notification  to  the MCIO,  which  may  start  an  investigation.  An  independent  investigation  does not, in itself, convert the restricted report to an unrestricted report. 3.4.3.3.  SARCs and VAs will also notify victims that any disclosure of information about  their  sexual  assault  to  individuals  other  than  the  SARC,  SAPR  VA,  VVA  or Healthcare Personnel may result in the initiation of an official investigation regarding the  allegations  of  the  disclosure  and  the  victim  could  lose  their  restricted  reporting 50 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 option (T-0). If the chain of command of the victim or law enforcement personnel is made aware of a sexual assault, AFOSI will be contacted to initiate an investigation (T-0). 3.4.3.4.  The  victim  will  acknowledge  his  or  her  understanding  of  the  restricted reporting  process;  i.e.,  that  restricted  reporting  necessarily  limits,  in  an  effort  to protect the victim’s privacy, the ability of the Air Force to investigate and take action (T-0). Victims will be made aware of protections available when making unrestricted reports (T-0). Use DD Form 2910; see Paragraph 3.5.4. for guidance when a victim refuses or is not in a viable condition to complete the DD Form 2910. 3.4.4.  For  the  purposes  of  public  safety  and  command  responsibility,  the  SARC  will  only report non-PII concerning sexual assault incidents (without information that could reasonably lead to personal identification of the victim or the alleged offender) (T-0). For notification to installation or host wing commander see 3.8. 3.4.5.  The confidentiality policy does not create an actionable right for the alleged offender or the victim and does not constitute a grant of immunity for any actionable conduct by the offender or victim. Any covered communication that has been disclosed, whether disclosure was authorized or unauthorized, may be used as the basis for disciplinary action against the offender  or  victim  as  appropriate.  However,  disposition  authorities  will  take  these circumstances into account in determining what, if any, action may be appropriate regarding the victim (T-0). 3.4.5.1.  State laws may impact the ability to make a restricted report.  3.4.5.1.1.  Health care may be provided and SAFE may be performed in a jurisdiction bound  by  state  and  local  laws  that  require  certain  personnel  (usually  health  care personnel) to  report the  sexual  assault  to  civilian agencies or law enforcement.  Law enforcement  may  take  jurisdiction  of  the  sexual  assault  case,  or  the  civilian jurisdiction may inform the military law enforcement or investigative community of a sexual assault that was reported to it. In such instances, it may not be possible for a victim to file a restricted report or it may not be possible to maintain the report as a restricted report.  3.4.5.1.2.  To  the  extent  possible,  the  Air  Force  will  honor  the  restricted  report; however,  sexual  assault  victims  need  to  be  aware  that  their  restricted  report  is  not guaranteed  due  to  circumstances  surrounding  the  independent  investigation  and requirements of individual state laws including:   3.4.5.1.2.1.  A victim will not be permitted to file a restricted report after a SARC has already been informed of an ongoing independent investigation of the sexual assault (T-0). 3.4.5.1.2.2.  If  an  independent  investigation  begins  AFTER  the  victim  has formally elected restricted reporting, the independent investigation has NO impact on the victim’s restricted report and the victim’s communications and SAFE Kit remain confidential, to the extent authorized by law.  3.4.6.  Independent  investigations  are  not  initiated  by  the  victim.  If  information  about  a sexual assault comes to a commander’s (or equivalent) attention from a source other than a AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 51 victim,  who  has  elected  restricted  reporting  or  where  no  election  has  been  made  by  the victim,  that  commander  (or  equivalent)  will  report  the  matter  to  an  MCIO  and  an  official (independent)  investigation  may  be  initiated  based  on  that  independently  acquired information (T-0). The SARC, SAPR VA, VVA, and Healthcare Personnel will not disclose covered communications, including the existence of a restricted report or prior contact with the victim, unless the victim authorizes the disclosure in writing or another exception applies (T-0). 3.4.6.1.  If there is an ongoing independent investigation, the sexual assault victim will no longer have the option of restricted reporting when: 3.4.6.1.1.  DoD law enforcement informs the SARC of the investigation (T-0). 3.4.6.1.2.  The victim has not already elected restricted reporting (T-0). 3.4.6.1.2.1.  A  victim  will  not  be  permitted  to  file  a  restricted  report  after  a SARC has already been informed of an ongoing independent investigation of the sexual assault (T-0). To be eligible for the restricted reporting option, the victim must file a restricted report by signing a DD Form 2910 BEFORE the SARC  is  informed  of  an  ongoing  independent  investigation  of  the  sexual assault (T-0). 3.4.6.1.2.1.1.  If a SARC is notified of an ongoing independent investigation and the victim has not signed a DD Form 2910 electing restricted report, the SARC must inform the victim that the option to file a restricted report is no longer  available  (T-0).  However,  communications  between  the  victim  and the  victim  advocate  will  remain  privileged,  IAW  MRE  514,  except  for  the minimum necessary to make the unrestricted report (T-0). 3.4.6.2.  When  the  SARC,  SAPR  VA,  or  VVA  learns  that  an  official  investigation  has been  initiated  based  on  independently  acquired  information,  the  SARC  will  notify  the victim as soon as possible (T-0). 3.5.  Receiving  Unrestricted  Reports.  Any  report  of  a  sexual  assault  made  through  normal reporting channels, including the victim’s chain of command, law enforcement, and the AFOSI or other criminal investigative service is considered an unrestricted report. If a victim elects this reporting  option,  a  victim  will  not  be  permitted  to  change  from  an  unrestricted  to  a  restricted report (T-0). 3.5.1.  The  individual  to  whom  the  report  was  made  notifies  the  SARC  who  will  assign  a SAPR VA or VVA to the individual, if desired (T-0). The assigned SAPR VA or VVA will advise the victim on available SVC services (T-0).  3.5.2.  Eligible  victims  requesting  to  make  an  unrestricted  or  restricted  report  and  utilize SAPR services must do so using the DD Form 2910 (T-0).  3.5.2.1.  A report can be made to healthcare personnel, but healthcare personnel must then immediately contact the SARC or SAPR VA to fill out the DD Form 2910 (T-0). Chaplains and military attorneys cannot take official reports. 3.5.3.  DoD  law  enforcement  agent  will  distribute  to  the  victim,  in  unrestricted  reporting cases, the completed DD Form 2701, Initial Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime, which sets out victims’ rights and points of contact.  52 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 3.5.4.  If a victim refuses or is too incapacitated to complete the DD Form 2910, the SARC can  consult  with  Healthcare  Personnel  to  ascertain  the  victim’s  capacity  for  making  the decision;  consultation  between  the  victim  and  Healthcare  Personnel  may  be  warranted  and would be a valid cause to  delay action on the DD Form 2910.  If, after review and possible consultation  with  Healthcare  Personnel,  the  SARC  and  Healthcare  Personnel  determine  the victim is stable enough to make a decision, the SARC will inform the victim on all eligible SAPR services (T-1). If the victim declines all services or refuses to complete the DD Form 2910, the SARC is not under any obligation or duty to inform investigators or commanders (or  equivalent)  about  the  report  and  will  not  produce  the  report  or  disclose  the communications  surrounding  the  report  (T-0).  If  commanders  (or  equivalent)  or  law enforcement ask about the report, the SARC will only make disclosures IAW exceptions to the MRE 514 privilege (T-0). 3.5.5.  When a SARC determines that an alleged  offender in  an unrestricted report has also been  accused  of  committing  an  offense  against  another  victim  in  the  care  of  the  SARC, SAPR VA or VVA, the SARC will seek immediate guidance from the appropriate SJA and not disclose this to the victims (T-0). 3.6.  Non-Participating  Victim.  For  victims  not  selecting  either  restricted  or  unrestricted reporting, the following guidelines apply: 3.6.1.  Only those personnel who have an official need to know will have access to the details regarding  the  incident  (T-0).  The  victim’s  decision  to  decline  to  participate  in  an investigation  or  prosecution  should  be  honored  by  all  personnel  charged  with  the investigation  and  prosecution  of  sexual  assault  cases,  including,  but  not  limited  to, commanders  (or  equivalent),  DoD  law  enforcement  officials,  and  personnel  in  the  victim’s chain of command. If at any time the victim who originally chose the unrestricted reporting option  declines  to  participate  in  an  investigation  or  prosecution,  that  decision  should  be honored IAW this subparagraph. The victim should be informed by the SARC, SAPR VA, or VVA that the investigation may continue regardless of whether the victim participates. 3.6.2.  The victim’s decision to decline to participate in an investigation or prosecution does not limit the commander’s authority to ensure good order and discipline of his or her unit. In general, commanders (or equivalent) should defer to the decision made by the victim not to participate  and  not  order  a  victim  to  testify  or  answer  interview  questions  when  the  victim declines  to  voluntarily  do  so.  Prior  to  ordering  a  victim  to  participate  in  any  stage  of  the investigation  or  prosecution,  commanders  (or  equivalent)  are  required  to  consult  with  the General  Court-Martial  Convening  Authority  (GCMCA)  who  receives  written  legal  advice from the servicing SJA prior to ordering a victim to participate  (T-1). The commander will consider the following factors prior to determining if a victim will be ordered to participate in the investigation:  3.6.2.1.  Timing of the victim’s declination in relation to the stage of the investigation or prosecution; 3.6.2.2.  Nature of the allegation against the accused to which victim’s participation could yield relevant evidence or testimony; 3.6.2.3.  Evidence  available  for  the  commander  (or  equivalent)  to  hold  the  alleged offender appropriately accountable without the victim’s participation; AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 53 3.6.2.4.  Whether there are other victims in the case; 3.6.2.5.  The  views  of  the  victim  on  issues  where  the  victim  is  consulted  by  the government through VWAP IAW AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice. 3.6.2.6.  The views of the victim and the victim’s SVC regarding the impact of an order to testify on the victim’s privacy interest as articulated by the victim and the SVC. 3.6.2.7.  The  degree  to  which  an  order  to  testify  or  answer  interview  questions  may inhibit the willingness of other victims who have not yet reported their sexual assaults to seek Air Force assistance. 3.6.2.8.  The degree to which ordering the victim to testify or answer interview questions may cause undue psychological trauma or stress that may negatively impact the victim’s mental health status in the opinion of an appropriate behavioral health specialist . 3.7.  Requirement  to  Report  Sexual  Assault.  Accurate reporting of sexual assaults remains a key  component  of  the  Sexual  Assault  Prevention  and  Response  program.  Releasing  non-personally identifiable information (PII) to the installation or host wing commander is intended to  provide  immediate  situational  awareness  and  general  environmental  information  about  the number and type(s) of sexual assault(s) on the installation and is to be used to provide a better understanding of incidents of sexual assault. Commanders may not initiate investigations based on information about restricted reports provided by SARCs, SAPR VAs or VVAs. 3.7.1.  Within  24  hours  after  a  victim  signs  a  DD  Form  2910  for  a  restricted  or unrestricted report, the SARC will use the template located in Attachment 2 to notify the installation or host wing commander that “a report of a sexual assault” has occurred  (T-0). The SAPR VA will provide notification if a SARC is unavailable (T-1). Notification may  be  extended  by  the  commander  to  48  hours  when  there  are  extenuating circumstances  in  deployed  environments.  The  victim’s  communication  with  the  SARC, SAPR VA and VVA is protected by MRE 514.   3.7.1.1.  The  SARC  will  report  non-PII  information  on  sexual  assault  incidents  to  the installation  commander  for  restricted  and  unrestricted  reports  (T-1).  The  SARC  will utilize the 24 hour notification template provided at Attachment 2, 24 Hour Restricted or Unrestricted Report Notification Template (T-1).  3.7.1.1.1.  SARCs  must  ensure  the  information  released  for  restricted  reports  only contains the following and may not deviate from this instruction (T-0):  3.7.1.1.1.1.  Assault  Occurred:  within  the  last  30  days;  more  than  30  days  ago; prior to military service; 3.7.1.1.1.2.  Time of day:  0600L-1759L, 1800L-0559L, both day or night due to multiple instances or undetermined; 3.7.1.1.1.3.  General  location:    on  installation,  off  installation,  multiple  or undetermined; 3.7.1.1.1.4.  Number of Victims; number of alleged assailants, if known; 3.7.1.1.1.5.  Nature  or  type  of  sexual  assault:    Penetration,  Non-Penetration  or unknown at this time. 54 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 3.7.1.1.1.6.  Victim status:  protected due to restricted report; 3.7.1.1.1.7.  Alleged assailant status:  protected due to restricted report; 3.7.1.1.1.8.  Alcohol involved:  protected due to restricted report;  3.7.1.1.1.9.  Drugs involved:  protected due to restricted report; and 3.7.1.1.1.10.  Confirm  that  the  victim  has  been  offered  SAPR  advocacy services,  an  explanation  of  the  notifications  in  the  DD  Form  2910;  medical and mental healthcare and informed of his/her eligibility for an SVC. 3.7.1.2.  The SARC will submit the 24 hour notification for all restricted and unrestricted reports  to  the  installation  commander  as  a  standalone  report  via  an  encrypted, unclassified  e-mail  (T-1).  The  installation  commander  will  forward  a  copy  to  the MAJCOM SARC who forwards to the MAJCOM/CV and AF/CVS (T-1). 3.7.2.  Within  24  hours of  an  unrestricted  report  of  sexual  assault,  the  SARC  or  SAPR  VA will contact the victim’s commander and provide the victim’s name and general location of the  incident  (if  known)  (T-1).  The  SARC  will  advise  the  victim’s  commander  s/he  may request the subject information, incident detail, and investigation information from the MCIO (T-3).  The  SARC  or  SAPR  VA  will  provide  additional  information  to  complete  a  SAIRO Report,  if  applicable,  IAW  section  3.9  (T-1).  This  notification  will  only  be  provided  to  the victim's  commander  and  no  others  (T-0).    If  the  commander  is  off  station,  the  notification will be provided to the acting commander (T-1). 3.7.2.1.  DELETED 3.7.2.2.  DELETED 3.7.2.3.  DELETED 3.7.2.4.  DELETED 3.7.2.5.  DELETED 3.7.2.6.  DELETED 3.7.2.7.  DELETED 3.7.2.7.1.  DELETED 3.7.2.8.  DELETED 3.7.3.  Any  military  member  or  civilian  employee,  other  than  those  authorized  to  receive confidential  communications  or  otherwise  exempted  by  operation  of  law,  regulation,  or policy,  who  receives  a  report  of  an  adult  sexual  assault  incident  involving  a  subordinate  in the  individual’s  supervisory  chain  will  report  the  matter  to  the  SARC,  Commander  (or equivalent)  and  AFOSI  (T-0).  Air  Force  Instructors,  with  exception  of  USAFA  instructors, are considered part of the supervisory chain (e.g. Officer Training School, Squadron Officer School,  Basic  Military  Training,  Senior  Noncommissioned  Officer  Academy,  Airmen Leadership  School,  First  Term  Airmen  Course,  Academy  Military  Training  NCOs,  and Academy  Air  Officer  Commanding  etc.).  Failure  to  comply  may  result  in  administrative action or action under the UCMJ. AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 55 3.7.4.  Military  members  or  civilian  employees,  other  than  those  authorized  to  received confidential communications or otherwise exempted by operation of law, regulation, policy, who  become  aware  of  an  adult  sexual  assault  incident,  not  involving  a  subordinate  in  the supervisory  chain,  are  strongly  encouraged,  but  not  required  to  report  the  incident  to  the installation SARC, AFOSI or encourage the victim to do so.  3.7.4.1.  If a report cannot be made to AFOSI, the report is made to Security Forces who notifies AFOSI. 3.7.4.2.  A SARC, SAPR VA, or VVA, who receives a report of a sexual assault incident about an individual who is eligible to make a restricted report and who is a subordinate in either the SARC’s, SAPR VA’s, or VVA’s supervisory chain, is not required to report the incident  to  DoD  law  enforcement  or  the  victim’s  commander.  However,  VVAs  will immediately refer these victims to the SARC or SAPR VA (T-1).  3.7.4.3.  A  chaplain  or  SVC  will  not  accept  a  sexual  assault  report;  however communication  related  to  the  incident  is  protected  (T-0).  Regardless,  if  the  reporting individual is a subordinate in either the chaplain or SVC’s supervisory chain or not, the chaplain and SVC are not required to report the incident to DoD law enforcement or the victim’s commander. 3.7.4.4.  A sexual assault victim certified under the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) is eligible for both the restricted and unrestricted reporting options. If electing restricted reporting, the victim is required to advise the competent medical authority of any factors that could have an adverse impact on the victim’s performance, reliability, or safety while performing PRP duties  (T-1). If necessary, the competent medical authority will inform the certifying official  that the person in  question should be temporarily suspended from PRP status,  without revealing that the person is  a sexual  assault  victim, thus  preserving the restricted report (T-1). 3.7.4.5.  Healthcare personnel will initiate emergency care and treatment of sexual assault victims  and  notify  the  SARC,  SAPR  VA,  or  VVA  without  delaying  care  to  the  victim IAW  AFI  44-102  (T-1).  SAPR  personnel  will  not  report  to  DoD  law  enforcement,  a supervisory  official,  or  the  victim’s  chain  of  command,  unless  federal  or  state  law requires other officials to be notified (T-0).  3.7.4.6.  Healthcare  personnel  who  are  providing  healthcare  services  (or  assisting  those providing  services)  to  subordinates  who  report  a  sexual  assault  are  exempt  from  this requirement. The exemption depends on whether the subordinate victim is presenting as a patient seeking healthcare services.  3.7.4.6.1.  A  senior  ranking  member  in  the  victim's  chain  of  command  who  is providing  or  assisting  in  the  provision  of  healthcare  services  is  exempt  from  the mandatory reporting requirement.  3.7.4.6.2.  If  a  victim  reports  a  sexual  assault  to  a  supervisor  in  a  subordinate-supervisor  capacity  (as  opposed  to  a  patient-provider  capacity),  the  supervisor  must report the sexual assault to the SARC and/or AFOSI (T-0).   56 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 3.8.  Sexual  Assault  Incident  Response  Oversight  (SAIRO)  Report.  The  FY14  National Defense  Authorization  Act  (NDAA),  PL  113-66,  section  1743,  requires  an  eight-day  incident report in response to an unrestricted report of sexual assault in which the victim is a member of the  Armed  Forces.  .  Directive  Type-Memorandum  14-007,  Sexual  Assault  Incident  Response Oversight  (SAIRO) Report, implements  this law for Unrestricted Reports that fall under SAPR and expands the eight-day incident report requirement to an Unrestricted Report or Independent Investigation. The purpose of the SAIRO is to detail the actions taken or in progress to provide the  necessary  care  and  support  to  the  victim  of  the  assault,  to  ensure  that  allegations  of  sexual assault are referred to the appropriate investigatory agencies, and to provide initial notification of the  serious  incident  to  appropriate  commanders.  Installation  or  host  wing  commander  will require  that  a  SAIRO  Report  is  provided  for  all  unrestricted  reports  and  Independent Investigations,  including  incidents  that  are  reported  at  the  current  time  but  occurred  before  the enlistment or commissioning of the Service member victim (T-0). 3.8.1.  Only one SAIRO Report is prepared per incident. The immediate commander, defined as the Squadron Commander (Sq/CC), Detachment Commander (Det/CC), HAF Director or civilian equivalent in coordination with the SARC and/or the MCIO, will prepare and submit the SAIRO Report (T-0). Figure 3.8 provides the SAIRO Report responsibility matrix. 3.8.1.1.  For SAIRO Reports triggered by an unrestricted report, the SARC is responsible for providing all victim information. The commander shall ask the MCIO to provide the incident data and investigation information (T-0).  3.8.1.2.  For SAIRO Reports triggered by an Independent Investigation, the Commander shall ask the MCIO to provide the available information; no information  is provided by the  SARC  (T-0).  Incident  data  cannot  be  acquired  through  a  command-directed investigation, which is prohibited for sexual assaults.  3.8.1.3.  The SAIRO Report does not replace the SARC’s mandatory 24 hour notification to the installation or host wing commander of a report of sexual assault. 3.8.1.4.  A SAIRO Report, in itself, does not automatically generate an OPREP-3 unless a Commander’s  Critical  Information  Requirement  (CCIR)  information  is  provided  to  the Installation Command Post. A CCIR is separate from the SAIRO report. 3.8.2.  The  commander  will  utilize  the  SAIRO  report  template  provided  at  Attachment  3, Sexual  Assault  Incident  Response  Oversight  (SAIRO)  Report  Template  (T-1).  The commander will ensure the memorandum’s subject reads: SEXUAL ASSAULT INCIDENT RESPONSE OVERSIGHT REPORT (T-1). 3.8.2.1.  The  commander  will  ensure  the  SAIRO  report  does  not  deviate  from  the information provided in Attachment 3 and does not contain any PII, victim photographs or additional incident information that could lead to personal identification of the victim or the subject (T-0). 3.8.2.2.  Some  information  may  not  be  available  from  the  SARC  or  MCIO  within  this timeframe; however this should not delay reporting. Information not received within the 8-day requirement is annotated on the template as “not available at time of report”. The SAIRO report is initial and final; follow-on reporting is not required. AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 57 3.8.3.  The  immediate  commander  will  submit  the  SAIRO  as  a  standalone  report  via  an encrypted,  unclassified  e-mail  (T-1).  Once  the  SAIRO  is  created,  the  victim’s  or  subject’s immediate  commander,  as  applicable,  will  e-mail  the  SAIRO  to  the  below  identified recipients (T-1).  3.8.3.1.  From  the  unit/CC  (e.g.  Sq/CC,  Det/CC  or  civilian  equivalent)  to  the  first  O-6 (typically Gp/CC) in the victims (if service member or Air Force civilian employee) and subjects (if service member) chain of command and the installation SARC (see Note1).  3.8.3.1.1.  First  O-6  forwards  to  the  installation  commander  (if  TDY  or  deployed notify the installation commander at the incident location) and if different, the victims (if service member or Air Force civilian employee) and subjects (if service member) WG/CC (T-0).  3.8.3.1.2.  Victims (if service member or Air Force civilian employee) and subjects (if service member) WG/CC will forward to the first G/FO and MAJCOM SARC in the respective  chain  of  command  (T-0).  If  the  subject  is  the  first  O-6  or  G/FO  in  the victim’s chain of command designated to receive the SAIRO, the report is provided to the next higher ranking commander in the chain of command. 3.8.3.1.3.  MAJCOM  SARC(s)  will  provide  to  MAJCOM/CV  and  AF/CVS  no  later than the next business day. If the victim and/or subject is an Air Force Reservist, the MAJCOM SARC(s) will forward a copy to the AFRC SARC. 3.8.3.2.  The  commander  and  personnel  with  access  to  the  report  will  ensure  that information  regarding  the  SAIRO  Report  is  only  released  to  personnel  with  an  official need to know IAW section 552a of Title 5, U.S.C. or as authorized by law (T-0). No one will  use  the  information  for  investigative  purposes  or  in  a  manner  that  is  likely  to discover, disclose, or reveal the identities being protected (T-0). 3.8.4.  The  installation  commander  will  ensure  all  group  commanders,  squadron  and detachment  commanders,  and  deputy  commanders  (to  include  tenants)  receive  SAIRO Report  training  from  the  SARC  upon  assuming  their  position  (T-1).  The  AF  Joint  Base Commander  or  Deputy  Joint  Base  Commander  (DBJC)  will  ensure  all  AF  tenant  group commander, unit commanders, and deputy commanders receive SAIRO Report training from the installation SARC upon assuming the position (T-1).   58 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 VICTIM’ IMMEDIATE COMMANDER Figure 3.1.

The  Air  Force  will  identify  trained military SARCs and SAPR VAs (and/or trained civilian SARC or SAPR VAs who volunteer) for Air  Expeditionary  Force  (AEF)  rotational  support  for  global  contingency  operations  consistent with  requirements established by the Combined Forces Air Component Commander (CFACC). Each Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) warrants at least one SARC and one SAPR VA position. For  deployments  smaller  than  an  AEF,  deployed  commanders  (or  equivalent)  must  provide  a sexual assault response capability consistent with the requirements of this AFI (T-0). 4.1.1.  For emerging operations, when practicable, the Air Component A1 should coordinate development  of  any  SARC  requirements  for  emerging  operations,  when  practicable,  with AFPC/DPW  and  AF/CVSO.  The  Air  Component  A1  and  AF/CVSO  keep  in  mind  the Commander, of the Air Forces’ (COMAFFOR) responsibility to ensure theater-wide support to  Airmen  in  smaller  units  at  potentially  isolated  sites,  and  determine  if  central  or  regional management can be effective. 4.1.2.  The Air Component A1 planner, during transition to sustained operations, will account for future rotations and coordinate those requirements with AF/CVSO (T-1). AF/CVSO will ensure  line  remarks  and  overlap  considerations  are  reviewed  to  ensure  seamless  exchange between outgoing and incoming SARCs and SAPR VAs. 4.1.3.  The  Air  Component  A1  SAPR,  for  sustained  operations,  will  provide  functional oversight  to  ensure  a  continued  response  capability  exists  to  support  their  AOR  (T-1).  The Air Component A1 SAPR will perform duties that include, but are not limited to: 4.1.3.1.  Designate  locations  that  require  a  SARC  and  SAPR  VA  and  ensure  that  those locations are sufficient to support the AOR throughout mission fluctuations (T-1). 4.1.3.2.  Coordinate with AF/CVSO on all SAPR issues needing resolution  4.1.3.3.  Coordinate with AF/CVSO, prior to taskings, to ensure SARCs and SAPR VAs that identified to deploy are D-SAACP certified during deployment (T-0). 4.1.4.  Deployed SARCs will:   4.1.4.1.  Identify  Volunteer  Victim  Advocates,  who  are  D-SAACP  certified,  in  theater and resolve with local command any gaps in this critical element of support (T-0). 4.2.  Training.  Home station unit commanders (or equivalent) must ensure deploying members are  trained  on  annual  SAPR  training  requirements  prior  to  departure  (T-0).  Annual  SAPR training  will  not  be  provided  to  deployed  members  in  theater  (T-1).

Coordinate  efforts  and  resources,  regardless  of  the  location  of  the  sexual  assault,  to direct  optimal  and  safe  administration  of  unrestricted  and  restricted  reporting  options  with appropriate protection, medical care, counseling, and advocacy (T-0). 4.3.3.  Ensure  a  24  hour  per  day,  7  day  per  week  response  capability  (T-0).  Require  first responders to respond in a timely manner (T-0). 4.3.4.  Response  times  are  based  on  local  conditions;  however,  sexual  assault  victims  are treated as emergency cases (T-0).  4.3.5.  Establish procedures to ensure the SARC is notified of every incident of sexual assault on the military installation, regardless of service oversight, so that a SARC or SAPR VA can respond and offer the victim SAPR services (T-0).  4.3.6.  Ensure sexual assault victims in deployed locations within the AOR are transported to an  appropriate  medical  evaluation  site,  evaluated,  treated  for  injuries  (if  any),  and  offered SARC and/or SAPR VA assistance and a SAFE as quickly as possible (T-0). 4.3.7.  Ensure  appropriate  capability  to  provide  experienced  and  trained  SARC  and  SAPR VA  services,  SAFE  providers  to  sexual  assault  victims  as  well  as  the  capability  to  conduct SAFEs  on  alleged  sexual  assault  perpetrators  (T-0).  Regardless  of  reporting  status,  if appropriate,  victims  will  be  medically  evacuated  to  facilities  with  required  capabilities  as soon as possible after making a report (T-0). 4.3.8.  Ensure the availability of trained and D-SAACP certified SAPR VAs or VVAs within the ranks to respond to victims whenever a sexual assault occurs in locations where Service victim  advocates  are  not  available  (e.g.,  when  deployed  for  JET  taskings)  (T-1).  Trained victim advocates will report to the responsible installation SARC when performing advocate duties (T-0). 4.3.9.  The  component  commander  (or  equivalent)  or  Deputy  will  provide  functional oversight for the SAPR program in their AOR (T-1). AF/CVSO will provide supervision and professional resources to deployed SARCs, SAPR VAs, and VVAs. AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 63 Chapter 5 COLLECTION AND PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE 5.1.  Collection and Proper Handling of Evidence. 5.1.1.  Healthcare providers will consider the medical condition, needs, requests, and desires of each sexual  assault  victim when engaging in  the collection, documentation and retention of  forensic  evidence  (T-0).  Criminal  investigators  should  be  consulted  before  evidence  is collected in support of unrestricted reports. 5.1.2.  Evidence collection, documentation and retention is the purview of law enforcement. Refer any questions to the assigned criminal investigator(s).  5.1.3.  SARCs, SAPR VAs, and VVAs have no responsibility for the collection of evidence for either restricted or unrestricted reporting. SARCs, SAPR VAs, and VVAs will not collect or receive evidence of a sexual assault from a victim (T-1).  5.1.4.  Healthcare  providers  will  offer  services  to  eligible  sexual  assault  victims  to  include the  ability  to  elect  a  SAFE  Kit  in  addition  to  the  general  medical  management  related  to sexual  assault  response,  and  mental  healthcare  (T-0).  Only  a  healthcare  provider  who  has specialized  education  and  clinical  experience  in  the  collection  of  forensic  evidence  and treatment of these victims can conduct the SAFE (T-0). 5.1.4.1.  The forensic component will document the SAFE utilizing the DD Form 2911, DoD  Sexual  Assault  Examination  Report.  This  report  documents  the  medical  forensic history  and  examination,  and  collects  biological  and  physical  findings,  any  pertinent evidence, and may document additional follow-up evidence as needed.  5.1.4.1.1.  FOIA requests for DD Forms 2911 are forwarded to HQ AFOSI/XILI for review and response. 5.1.4.2.  The  victim  will  be  advised  to  keep  a  copy  of  the  DD  Form  2910  and  the  DD Form 2911 as these forms may be used by the victim in other matters with other agencies (e.g., Department of Veterans Affairs) or for any other lawful purpose (T-0).  5.1.4.2.1.  SARCs will provide the victim a replacement copy of the DD Form 2910 within seven business days upon request  (T-1). SARCs will forward all requests for copies  of  DD  Forms  2911  completed  in  support  of  unrestricted  cases  to  the appropriate law enforcement entity (T-1). The SARC will document requests on the DD  Form  2910  and  maintain  a  copy  of  the  updated  form  reflecting  the  victim’s request (T-0). 5.1.5.  The  process  for  collecting  and  preserving  sexual  assault  evidence  for  the  restricted reporting  option  is  the  same  as  the  unrestricted  reporting  option,  except  that  the  restricted reporting option does not trigger the official investigative process. 5.1.5.1.  Healthcare providers will ensure forensic evidence gathered in a restricted report is marked with the Restricted Report Control Number (RRCN) generated by the SARC, in the location where the victim’s name would have otherwise been written on the SAFE kit  (T-0).  Healthcare  providers  will  treat  the  victim’s  SAFE  and  accompanying  kit  as  a 64 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 confidential  communication  under  this  reporting  option  (T-0).  See  paragraph  5.3.3.1.1. for generating the RRCN.  5.1.6.  Installation or host wing commander will ensure MOU(s) or MOA(s), with  off-base, non-military  facilities  for  the  purposes  of  providing  medical  care  to  eligible  sexual  assault victims  covered  under  this  instruction,  include  instructions  for  notifying  the  SARC (regardless  of  whether  a  restricted  or  unrestricted  report  of  sexual  assault  is  involved), procedures  for  the  receipt  of  evidence,  how  to  request  a  RRCN,  instructions  on  where  to write  the  RRCN  on  the  SAFE  Kit,  and  evidence  disposition  back  to  the  servicing  judge advocate office (T-0). 5.2.  Unrestricted Reports. 5.2.1.  The  SARC,  SAPR  VA,  or  VVA  will  contact  AFOSI  as  soon  as  possible  once  the victim has elected to make an unrestricted report (T-1). The SARC, SAPR VA, or VVA will then  inform  the  victim  of  the  option  of  a  SAFE  and  advise  AFOSI  as  soon  as  possible  the victim has elected to receive a SAFE (T-1). 5.2.2.  Upon SAFE completion, the healthcare provider will provide the victim a copy of the DD Form 2911, and then package, inventory, seal, and label the evidence container(s) with the  victim’s  name  (T-0).  The  healthcare  provider  notifies  the  AFOSI  or  Military  Service designated law enforcement agency the evidence is ready and will provide law enforcement personnel an inventory of the sealed SAFE kit upon pickup (T-0). 5.2.3.  Healthcare  Personnel  will  provide  the  SAFE  Kit  to  AFOSI  or  Military  Service designated  law  enforcement  agency  who  log,  store,  and  preserve  the  SAFE  kit  (T-0). Evidence retention is governed by DoDI 5505.18, Investigation of Adult Sexual Assault in the Department of Defense. 5.2.4.  DoD  law  enforcement  agents  will  distribute  the  completed  DD  Form  2701  to  the victim Internet  at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/eforms/dd2701.pdf. (T-0).  The  DD  Form  2701  can  be  obtained  via the 5.3.  Restricted Reports. 5.3.1.  When  the  SARC,  SAPR  VA,  or  VVA  receives  a  sexual  assault  restricted  report,  the SARC, SAPR VA, or VVA will inform the victim of the option for a SAFE and of any other state or local sexual assault reporting requirements that may affect restricted reporting (T-0). 5.3.2.  Upon  completion  of  the  SAFE  in  a  restricted  reporting  case,  the  healthcare  provider will  provide  a  copy  of  the  DD  Form  2911  to  the  victim,  then  package,  seal,  and  label  the evidence container(s) with a RRCN to be used in lieu of PII  (T-0). The healthcare provider will  secure  a  third  copy  of  the  DD  Form  2911  to  the  evidence  container  inside  a  sealed envelope (T-0). 5.3.3.1.  The  healthcare  provider  will  use  the  RRCN  in  lieu  of  PII  to  label  and  identify evidence  collected  in  a  SAFE  Kit  (e.g.,  accompanying  documentation,  personal  effects, and  clothing)  (T-0).  The  SARC  will  provide  (or  the  SAPR  VA  if  designated  by  the SARC) the healthcare provider with the RRCN to use in place of PII (T-0). 5.3.3.1.1.  The  SARC  will  ensure  all  restricted  reports  are  assigned  a  RRCN  (T-0). The SARC will develop the RRCN using a two-digit year, two-digit month, the first four  letters  of  the  installation  name,  a  three-digit  numerical  sequence,  and  followed AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 65 by  the  letter  “R”  (T-0).  For  example,  “1307RAND001R”  represents  the  incident occurred in 2013, during July, at Randolph AFB, is the first report of this sequence, and is a restricted report. 5.3.3.1.2.  When  receiving  transferred  cases  from  other  installations,  SARCs  will create  and  maintain  an  appropriate  record  based  on  the  type  of  report  (T-1).  For restricted  reports,  SARCs  will  add  a  “T”  to  the  end  of  the  RRCN  and  ensure transferred cases are not counted as new cases (T-1). 5.3.3.2.  Upon  completion  of  the  SAFE  Kit,  the  healthcare  provider  will  notify  the AFOSI or Military Service designated law enforcement agency (T-0).  5.3.4.  Healthcare  personnel  will  provide  the  SAFE  Kit  to  AFOSI  or  Military  Service designated  law  enforcement  agency  who  logs,  stores,  and  preserves  the  SAFE  kit  (T-0). Evidence retention is governed by DoDI 5505.18, Investigation of Adult Sexual Assault in the Department  of  Defense.  The  DoD  law  enforcement  agency  will  store  the  SAFE  kit  for  5 years from the date of the victim’s restricted report of the sexual assault (T-0). 5.3.5.  The SARC will contact the victim at the 1-year mark of making a restricted report in which a SAFE kit was completed (T-0).  The SARC will inquire whether the victim wishes to  change  his  or  her  reporting  option  to  unrestricted  and  annotate  their  decision  on  the victim’s DD Form 2910 (T-0). Once annotated the updated DD Form 2910 will be uploaded into DSAID as well as input the notification date in DSAID per the DSAID manual. 5.3.5.1.  The SARC will emphasize to the victim that his or her privacy is respected and he or she will not be contacted again by the SARC (T-1). The SARC will stress it is the victim’s  responsibility  from  that  point  forward,  if  the  victim  wishes  to  change  from  a restricted to an unrestricted report, to contact a SARC before the 5-year retention period elapses (T-1).  5.3.5.2.  If the victim does not change to unrestricted reporting, the SARC will explain to the victim that the SAFE Kit is retained for four more years and then destroyed (T-0). 5.3.5.3.  The victim will be advised  again  to  keep copies of the  DD  Form 2910 and the DD  Form  2911  as  these  forms  may  be  used  by  the  victim  in  other  matters  with  other agencies (e.g., Department of Veterans Affairs) or for any other lawful purpose (T-0).  5.3.5.4.  If the victim cannot be located at the 1-year mark, the SARC will appropriately document the efforts to locate the victim on the DD Form 2910 (T-0).  the  5  year  mark, 5.3.5.4.1.  At to  complete  any documentation  required  from  AFOSI  for  the  destruction  of  evidence.  The  DoD  law enforcement  agency  will  destroy  the  evidence  maintained  under  the  victim’s  RRCN in  compliance  with  established  procedures  IAW  DoDI  5505.18  (T-0).  However, officials will maintain the DD Form 2910 and DD Form 2911 for 50 years (T-0). the  SARC is  authorized 5.3.6.  If,  before  the  expiration  of  the  5  year  storage  period,  a  victim  changes  his  or  her reporting  preference  to  the  unrestricted  reporting  option,  the  SARC  will  notify  AFOSI  or Military  Service  designated  law  enforcement  agency  as  soon  as  possible  and  provide  the victim’s assigned RRCN to enable investigators to associate any previously-seized evidence with the unrestricted report (T-0). 66 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 5.3.6.1.  A  victim  may  change  his  or  her  reporting  preference  after  the  5-year  mark however; any evidence in custody is destroyed at the 5-year mark IAW DoDI 5505.18. AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 67 Chapter 6 COMMAND ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO SEXUAL ASSAULT 6.1.  Commander (or Equivalent) Responsibilities.  Commanders (or equivalent) will actively support sexual assault prevention and response programs, are responsible for victim and alleged subjects, as well as, criminal justice procedures that enable the accused to be held appropriately accountable for their actions (T-0). 6.2.

The appropriate  civilian  authorities  includes,  at  a  minimum,  the  local  civilian  law enforcement agency or agencies with jurisdiction to respond to an emergency call from the residence of any individual involved in the order. 6.2.1.3.2.  Advise  the  person  seeking  the  MPO  that  the  MPO  is  not  enforceable  by civilian authorities off base and that victims desiring protection off base should seek a civilian  protective  order  (CPO)  (T-1).  Off  base  violations  of  the  MPO  should  be reported to the issuing commander, law enforcement, and AFOSI for investigation.  6.2.1.3.3.  Provide  the  victim(s)  and  the  alleged  offender(s)  with  copies  of  the completed  MPO  (T-1).  Verbal  MPOs  can  be  issued,  but  need  to  be  subsequently documented as soon as possible. 6.2.1.4.  Be  aware  of  the  array  of  personnel  actions  that  are  available  and  may  be appropriate  in  these  cases.  These  actions  could  include,  among  others:  alternative  duty locations,  hours,  or  assignments  within  a  unit;  PCA  on  the  installation;  and  PCS, including  expedited  transfers,  when  requested  by  victims  having  made  an  unrestricted report. Upon request for an expedited transfer, the commander will contact the SARC and directly counsel the service member to ensure that he or she is fully informed per Chapter 11 of this instruction (T-1). 6.2.1.5.  Attend  CMG  for  all  unrestricted  reports  and,  if  necessary,  chair  the  High-Risk Response Team (HRRT), both explained in detail in chapter 8 (T-0). 6.2.1.6.  Ensure  complaints  of  sex-related  offenses  against  Airmen  assigned  to  their command,  regardless  of  grade,  resulting  in  conviction  by  court-martial,  non-judicial punishment  or  punitive  administrative  action  (defined  as  a  LOR)  are  annotated  in  an Airman’s  evaluation  (EPRs,  OPRs,  TRs,  and  mandatory  LOEs),  which  is  filed  in  the Airman’s  official  personnel  record  IAW  AFI  36-2406,  Officer  and  Enlisted  Evaluation Systems (T-0). 6.3.  Keeping the Victim Informed and Use of Information. 6.3.1.  Within  72  hours  after  the  CMG,  the  victim’s  unit  commander  (or  equivalent)  will ensure  the  victim  receives  a  monthly  update  on  the  current  status  of  all  investigative, medical,  legal,  and  command  proceedings  pertaining  to  the  unrestricted  case,  until  final sexual  assault  case  disposition  (T-0).  The  commander  will  ensure  information  provided  is consistent  with  any  applicable  directives  governing  release  of  information  and  coordinated with the SARC to ensure the victim’s case file is updated (T-0). At the victim’s preference, AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 69 the update can be provided in person, by encrypted email, by video teleconference (VTC), or by telephone. Reference Chapter 11 for expedited transfer guidance. 6.3.1.1.  For  purposes  of  this  Instruction,  final  disposition  means  the  conclusion  of  any judicial,  non-judicial,  or  administrative  action  (including  administrative  separation actions)  taken  in  response  to  the  allegation  of  sexual  assault.  These  requirements  are independent of other notification requirements established by law or regulation. 6.3.2.  In unrestricted reports of sexual assault or in cases in which information is disclosed through an independent source, and the victim does not elect to complete a DD Form 2910, officials will ensure details of the allegation are only provided to those personnel who have an official need to know (T-0). 6.3.2.1.  Those  who  have  an  “official  need  to  know”  in  the  Air  Force  routinely  include law  enforcement,  the  victim’s  commander  (or  equivalent),  the  alleged  offender’s commander,  legal  personnel,  the  SARC,  SAPR  VA,  assigned  VVA,  and  healthcare personnel required to provide healthcare. 6.3.2.2.  Commanders (or equivalent) will examine all procedures involved in the use of sexual assault information to ensure the guidance in this AFI is met (T-1). 6.3.2.3.  Commanders will ensure all disclosures comply with the provisions of AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program (T-1). 6.4.  Victim Collateral Misconduct. 6.4.1.  An  investigation  into  the  facts  and  circumstances  surrounding  an  alleged  sexual assault may produce evidence that the victim engaged in misconduct. Collateral misconduct by a sexual assault victim is a significant barrier to reporting because of the victim’s fear of punishment. Some reported sexual assaults involve circumstances where the victim may have engaged  in  some  form  of  misconduct  (e.g.,  underage  drinking  or  other  related  alcohol offenses, adultery, fraternization, or other violations of certain regulations or orders).  6.4.2.  IAW  the  UCMJ,  the  Manual  for  Courts-Martial,  and  AFI(s),  commanders  (or equivalent)  are  responsible  for  addressing  misconduct  in  a  manner  that  is  consistent  and appropriate to the circumstances. 6.4.3.  Commanders  (or  equivalent)  with  Special  Court-Martial  Convening  Authority (SPCMCA)  and  who  are  in  the  grade  of  O-6  or  higher,  IAW  Secretary  of  Defense Memorandum,  dated  20  April  2012,  have  the  authority  to  determine  the  appropriate disposition  of alleged victim misconduct,  to  include deferring disciplinary  action until  after disposition  of  the  sexual  assault  case  (and  not  be  penalized  for  such  a  deferral  decision). When considering what  corrective actions may be appropriate,  commanders (or equivalent) balance  the  objectives  of  holding  members  accountable  for  their  own  misconduct  with  the intent  to  avoid  unnecessary  additional  trauma  to  sexual  assault  victims  and  the  goal  of encouraging sexual assault reporting. The gravity of any collateral misconduct by the victim, and its impact on good order and discipline, should be carefully considered in deciding what, if any, corrective action is appropriate. Commanders (or equivalent) should consult with their servicing SJA prior to taking any action regarding collateral misconduct.   70 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 6.5.  Sexual Assault Case Disposition Authority. 6.5.1.  IAW Secretary of Defense Memorandum, dated 20 April 2012, the initial disposition authority  is  withheld  from  all  commanders  (or  equivalent)  within  the  DoD  who  do  not possess at least SPCMCA and who are not in the grade of O-6 or higher, with respect to the alleged offenses of  sexual assault and all attempts to commit such offenses, in violation of Articles  120,  125,  and  80  of  the  UCMJ.  The  Secretary’s  memorandum  does  not  withhold disposition  authority  with  regard  to  the  alleged  offenses  of  aggravated  sexual  contact  or abusive sexual contact or attempts to commit these offenses, in violation of Articles 120 and 80 of the UCMJ. Additionally, this withholding applies to other alleged offenses arising from or  relating  to  the  same  incident(s),  whether  committed  by  the  alleged  perpetrator  or  the alleged  victim  (collateral  misconduct)  of  the  rape,  sexual  assault,  forcible  sodomy,  or  the attempts thereof. SPCMCAs may withhold disposition authority of other sex-related offenses not withheld by the Secretary’s memorandum. 6.5.2.  Consistent  with  the  Secretary  of  Air  Force  Memorandum,  dated  17  June  2013  the SPCMCA is required to provide the GCMCA in the grade of O-7 or above written notice of the initial disposition action he or she has taken in the case within 30 days following the date of the initial disposition decision (T-1).  6.5.2.1.  This  policy  applies  to  the  alleged  offenses  of  rape,  sexual  assault,  forcible sodomy, and all attempts to commit such offenses, in violation of Articles 120, 125, and 80 of the UCMJ.  6.5.2.2.  When  disposition  of  the  alleged  offenses  of  rape,  sexual  assault,  forcible sodomy, and all attempts to commit such offenses, in violation of Articles 120, 125, and 80  of  the  UCMJ,  is  complete,  the  GCMCA  will  sign  the  written  report  of  command action required to be produced on all covered offenses and provides it to AFOSI (T-1).  6.5.2.3.  For  alleged  offenses  of  aggravated  sexual  contact  or  abusive  sexual  contact  or attempts  to  commit  these  offenses,  in  violation  of  Articles  120  and  80  of  the  UCMJ, group  commanders  (or  equivalent)  or  higher  will  sign  the  written  report  of  command action required to be produced and provides it to AFOSI (T-1). 6.5.3.  Any  commander  authorized  to  dispose  of  cases  involving  an  allegation  of  sexual assault will do so only after receiving the advice of the servicing SJA (T-1).  6.6.  Separation Actions Involving Sexual Assault Victims. 6.6.1.  Separation actions involving sexual assault victims are processed  IAW  AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers; AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen, and AFI 36-3209, Separation and Retirement Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members.  6.6.2.  When  a  commander  recommending  administrative  or  medical  separation  action  is aware, or is  made aware by  the respondent  or others, that the respondent is  alleging or has alleged  that  he  or  she  was  the  sexual  assault  victim,  the  commander  (or  equivalent)  shall notify the separation authority that the discharge proceeding involves a sexual assault victim (T-1).  AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 71 6.6.2.1.  Commanders  (or  equivalent)  will  ensure  the  following  statement  is  included  in the  recommendation  for  discharge  memorandum:  “The  respondent,  (grade  and  name), reported being a sexual assault victim” (T-1). 6.6.2.2.  The  commander  (or  equivalent)  recommending  administrative  or  medical separation must provide sufficient information to the separation authority concerning the alleged  assault  and  the  respondent’s  status  to  ensure  a  full  and  fair  consideration  of  the victim’s  military  service  and  particular  situation  (T-1).  Commanders  (or  equivalent) should  consult  with  AFOSI  and  the  servicing  SJA  for  guidance  on  the  level  of information that may be applicable. 6.6.3.  An enlisted member or a commissioned officer who made an unrestricted report and is recommended  for  involuntary  separation  within  1  year  of  final  disposition  of  their  sexual assault  allegation  can  request  a  review  of  their  administrative  or  involuntary  separation  by the first General Officer (GO) or Flag Officer (FO) in the chain of command. 72 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 Chapter 7 SAPR TRAINING 7.1.  Training.  Delivering  consistent  and  coherent  messaging  within  our  Air  Force  generates opportunities to create new and existing protective factors and strengthen our collective resolve to  eliminate  sexual  assault.  We  will  institutionalize  an  environment  of  dignity  and  respect  by developing skills which inspire courage and confidence to confront attitudes and behaviors that erode  our  core  values.  The  objective  of  SAPR  training,  therefore,  is  to  offer  a  comprehensive multi-faceted  approach  to  preserving  our  Air  Force  heritage  by  utilizing  awareness  and prevention education, recognizing and presenting effective victim advocacy, clarifying reporting options  and  the  response  process,  and  promoting  societal  change  through  individual  and community collaboration IAW DoDI 6495.02, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program Procedures.  Commanders  (or  equivalent),  supervisors  and  managers  at  all  levels  shall  be responsible for ensuring their personnel are trained on the SAPR program and services (T-0).  7.2.  General Training Requirements. 7.2.1.  Trainers and curriculum developers must ensure SAPR trainings and curriculums are in  line  with  the  DoD  established  core  competencies  and  learning  objectives  to  assure consistency  and  effectiveness  in  training  at  all  command  levels  (T-0).  Trainers  and curriculum developers will ensure SAPR training, at a minimum, incorporates adult learning theory, which includes interaction and group participation and is appropriate to the Airmen’s grade  and  commensurate  with  their  level  of  responsibility,  position  and  rank  (T-0).  SAPR curriculums  build  on  a  continuum  of  education,  throughout  an  Airmen’s  career,  enhancing their  understanding  and  providing  necessary  skills  to  create  environments  of  dignity  and respect.   7.2.2.  AF/CVS  will  develop,  review  or  update  all  Air  Force-level  SAPR  lesson  plans, objectives,  materials  and  programs.  Responder  training,  as  identified  in  DoDI  6495.02, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program Procedures, Chapter 10 will be developed by  the  appropriate  functional  community  (e.g.  JA,  SG,  AFOSI,  SFS,  and  HC).  All  training and  curriculums,  at  a  minimum,  emphasize  that  preventing  sexual  assault  as  a  mission imperative and include the mandated training requirements outlined in DoDI 6495.02. 7.2.2.1.  Victim  sensitivity  and  care  are  top  Air  Force  priorities  when  providing  any SAPR training; therefore, trainers and curriculum developers must include a disclaimer at the  beginning  of  all  SAPR  trainings  (T-1).  Trainers  and  curriculum  developers  will ensure the disclaimer allows survivors the option to receive training individually from the SAPR  office  and  as  applicable,  notify  audience  members  of  the  potential  for  graphic language  of  a  sexual  nature.  Although  some  participants  may  find  the  topic uncomfortable  or  language  offensive,  changing  attitudes  and  behaviors  in  the  area  of sexual assault prevention requires an open dialog among participants.  7.2.3.  Any films, videos or lesson plans require approval for use in SAPR specific training. Trainers and curriculum developers must submit these resources to AF/CVSO for review (T-1).  A  listing  of  approved  films  and  videos  is  maintained  and  posted  to  the  AF  SAPR SharePoint. ANG SARCs will receive approval for any films, videos or lesson plans from the AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 73 ANG  SAPR  Office  (T-1).  (Exception:  Responder  training,  as  identified  in  DoDI  6495.02 does not require approval but rather coordination from AF/CVSO). 7.2.4.  Sources of commission will include in their trainee/cadet curricula substantive course work that addresses honor, respect, character development, leadership, and accountability, as they pertain to the issue of preventing sexual assault and providing the appropriate response to sexual assault when it occurs (T-0). 7.3.  Annual Training Requirements. 7.3.1.  Commanders  (or  equivalent)  will  ensure  all  Military  (Reg  AF,  Reserve  and  Guard) and DAF civilian personnel, both appropriated and non-appropriated fund employees receive, at a minimum, annual SAPR training  (T-0). DoD contractors may be required to attend per the terms of their contract. Otherwise, DoD contractors are highly encouraged to  attend the training. 7.3.1.1.  SARCs, in coordination with Unit Training Managers or Unit Ancillary Training Monitors,  will  ensure  training  is  offered  and  their  supported  population  receives mandatory  annual  training  per  guidance  provided  by  AF/CVS  (T-1).  MAJCOM  SAPR Program  Managers  will  ensure  guidance,  training  materials,  and  suspenses  for  training completion are disseminated to the installation level. 7.3.1.2.  UTMs  and  UATMs  will  provide  SARCs  with  updates  on  how  many  and  who require annual training for their assigned installation, as requested (T-1). 7.3.1.3.  The SAPR office will retain rosters of annual SAPR training for a period of two years  (T-1).  If  the  SAPR  office  is  utilizing  SAPR  trained  facilitators  to  assist  with training, the SARC will receive a copy and maintain the sign-in rosters within the SAPR office (T-1).  7.3.2.  SAPR  training  delivered  during  Professional  Military  Education  (PME)  does  not satisfy the annual training requirement.    7.3.3.  The  member’s  respective  Military  Service  will  provide  for  the  delivery  of  annual training in joint environments.  7.3.4.  Organizations  providing  SAPR  training,  in  addition  to  what  is  prescribed  IAW  this instruction  and  DoDI  6495.02  that  is  2  or  more  hours,  must  obtain  AF/CVS  review  and approval  (T-1).  (Exception:  Responder  training,  as  identified  in  DoDI  6495.02  does  not require approval from AF/CVSO). 7.4.  Training for Deploying Personnel. 7.4.1.  Commanders  (or  equivalent)  will  ensure  their  deploying  personnel  complete  all  pre- and post-deployment SAPR training requirements (T-0).   7.4.2.  Pre-deployment SAPR training.

Active and reserve component Airmen, regardless of when or where the sexual assault took place; 8.1.2.  CMG  oversight  for  unrestricted  reports  of  adult  sexual  assaults  is  triggered  by  open cases  in  DSAID  initiated  by  a  signed  DD  Form  2910  or  an  investigation  initiated  by  an MCIO. In a case where there is an investigation initiated by an MCIO, but no corresponding unrestricted DD Form 2910 (T-0): 8.1.2.1.  The SARC would have no information for the CMG members.

Purpose.  An  ET  provides  victims  who  file  an  unrestricted  report  of  sexual  assault  the option  of  a  permanent  change  of  station  (PCS)  or  a  temporary  or  permanent  change  of assignment  (PCA)  to  a  location  that  will  assist  with  the  immediate  and  future  welfare  of  the victim, while also allowing them to move to locations that can offer additional support to assist with  healing,  recovery,  and  rehabilitation.  Members  will  only  be  eligible  to  receive  one facilitated ET for an unrestricted report of sexual  assault  (T-1). Multiple reassignment requests for the same reported incident are only considered in exceptional circumstances (e.g., the alleged perpetrator is acquitted at a court-martial where the victim testified and subsequently PCSs to the same duty station as the victim). 11.1.1.  ET  is  available  to  active  (to  include  non-prior  service  Airmen  performing  initial skills  training),  guard,  and  reserve  component  Airmen  who  file  an  unrestricted  report  of sexual assault or other offense listed in UCMJ Articles 120, 120a, 120c  or 125 (T-0). Once an  ET  has  been  approved,  the  change  of  assignment  is  handled  IAW  established  Air  Force regulation AFI 36-2110, Assignments. These procedures for an ET do not pertain to victims covered under the Threatened Person Assignments. 11.1.2.  The installation or host wing commander considers potential  transfer of the alleged offender  instead  of  the  victim  if  appropriate.  At  a  minimum,  the  installation  or  host  wing commander will control, as appropriate, the alleged offender’s access to the victim who made the  unrestricted  report  (T-0).  Alleged  offender  reassignments  are  handled  IAW  10  U.S.C. section  674  and  AFI  36-2110,  Assignments.  The  installation  or  host  wing  commander  may delegate this requirement to the WG/CV but will not delegate it further (T-1). 11.1.2.1.  The  offender’s  commander  (or  equivalent), installation  or  host  wing commander  and  AFPC  will  coordinate  the  determination  to  transfer  of  the  alleged offender  instead  of  the  victim  (T-1).  Transfers  for  offenders  are  not  in  the  duties  and responsibilities of the SARC or SAPR VA. 11.1.3.  In some instances retraining may be required to accommodate ET. When retraining is necessary it is completed IAW AFI 36-2626, Airman Retraining Program. Retraining actions are  considered  as  needed;  however  the  goal  is  timely  reassignment  actions  with  minimal impact to an Airmen’s career. 11.1.4.  Non-prior service students  in  technical  training pipelines are  eligible to  request  and be granted an ET. These members have additional options available to them  IAW technical training  reclassification  procedures  outlined  in  AFI  36-2110,  Attachment  21  to  ensure  the member receives the benefit of formal training. 11.2.  Safety of Airmen. 11.2.1.  Commanders and personnel with information of a serious threat of person (to include threat  to  life) will immediately  reported to  command and  DoD law enforcement  authorities (includes all DOD law enforcement units, security forces, and military criminal investigative organizations) (T-0). A request to transfer the victim under these circumstances, as opposed to ET, is handled IAW established Air Force regulations AFI 36-2110, Assignments. AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 99 11.3.  Request Process. 11.3.1.  Military  victims  shall  be  informed  of  the  expedited  transfer  process  by  the  SARC, SAPR VA, VVA, SVC or the victim’s commander (or equivalent), at the time of the initial report of sexual assault, or as soon as practicable (T-0).  11.3.1.1.  Victims  may  request  a  temporary  or  permanent  unit  transfer,  a  temporary  or PCA,  or  a  PCS.

Upon receipt of the signed ET Commander’s memorandum from the squadron commander  or  equivalent,  the  installation  or  host  wing  commander  (or  equivalent)  will make  a  determination  to  approve  or  disapprove  the  ET  request  (T-1).  Upon determination, the Commander’s Memorandum is forwarded back to the SARC who will provide it to the victim (T-1). 11.3.2.2.1.  The installation or host wing commander (or equivalent) will approve or disapprove  the  victim’s  request  within  72  hours  (consecutive  hours,  includes weekends  and  holidays)  of  the  victim  initiating  the  request  (T-0)  ((T-1)  for  host WG/CC  approval/disapproval).  The  installation  or  host  wing  commander  may delegate  this  responsibility  to  the  Vice  Commander  (or  equivalent),  but  will  not delegated it further (T-1).  100 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 11.3.2.2.1.1.

The  victim  is  prompted  to  upload  the  signed  ET  Commander’s Memorandum and all documents related to the approved ET in vMPF.  11.3.2.3.1.2.  Once the victim submits the ET in vMPF, the squadron commander or  equivalent  receives  the  request  in  vMPF.  The  squadron  commander  or equivalent will forward the ET request in vMPF to AFPC (T-1).  11.3.2.3.1.2.1.  The  request  is  sent  through  e-coordination  to  the  Total  Force Service  Center  (TFSC)  who  forwards  it  to  HQ  AFPC,  Humanitarian  and Exceptional  Family  Member  Program  Assignments  Branch, (HQ AFPC/DPAPH)  for  execution  of  reassignment  orders.

Commanders  have  the  authority  to  make  a  timely  determination and  to  take  action  regarding  whether  a  service  member  who  is  alleged  to  have committed or attempted to commit a sexual assault offense should be temporarily reassigned  or  removed  from  a  position  of  authority  or  from  an  assignment.  This reassignment or removal must be taken not  as a punitive measure, but solely for the purpose of maintaining good order and discipline within the member’s unit  11.5.2.11.1.2.  This  determination  may  be  made  at  any  time  after  receipt  of notification of an unrestricted report of a sexual assault that identifies the service member as an alleged perpetrator. 11.5.2.12.  Other pertinent circumstances. 11.5.3.  If the ET request is based on an incident that resulted in a court -martial acquittal, the standard  for  recommending  approval  of  a  request  is  still  determined  on  whether  a  credible report  was  filed.  The  commander  (or  equivalent)  shall  consider  all  the  facts  and AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 105 circumstances surrounding the case and the basis for the transfer request (T-0). Consultation with the Staff Judge Advocate in making the determination is recommended. 11.5.4.  Commanders of Reserve Component members will facilitate all elements of the ET program  for  which  they  have  legal  authority  (T-1).  Commanders  of  ANG  members  will facilitate all elements of the ET program IAW CNGBI 1303.01A (T-0). 11.5.4.1.  If  requested  by  the  victim,  the  commander  (or  equivalent)  will  allow  for separate  training  on  different  weekends  or  times  from  the  alleged  offender  (T-0).  The commander  (or  equivalent)  will  also  consider  a  different  unit  in  the  home  drilling location  to  ensure  undue  burden  is  not  placed  on  the  victim  and  their  family  by  the transfer (T-0).  11.6.  Continuity of Victim Care. 11.6.1.  When  an  ET  is  approved,  notification  from  the  losing  commander  to  the  gaining commander will depend on whether there is an open case and continuation of services (T-0). If  there  is  neither  an  open  case  nor  continuation  of  services,  no  other  action  is  needed.  If there is an open case and services are requested, then notification to the gaining commander will occur to facilitate the investigation and access to services (T-0). This procedure applies to any sexual assault victim move (e.g. PCA or PCS). 11.6.1.1.  When  an  Expedited  Transfer  is  approved,  the  losing  commander  will  NOT inform the gaining commander of the sexual assault incident unless one of the following applies: 11.6.1.1.1.  Active criminal investigation. 11.6.1.1.2.  Active legal proceeding. 11.6.1.1.3.  Ongoing  victim  healthcare  (medical  or  mental  health)  needs  that  are directly related to the sexual assault. 11.6.1.1.4.  Ongoing monthly CMG oversight involving the victim or 11.6.1.1.5.  Active SAPR victim support services. 11.6.2.  When an ET is approved, the losing commander will inform the gaining commander of  the  inbound  ET  if  any  of  the  circumstances  in  paragraphs  11.6.1.1.-11.6.1.1.5.  are occurring  (T-0).  The  losing  commander  will  limit  the  information  given  to  objective  facts about  victim  care  provided,  status  of  open  investigations,  and  the  status  of  ongoing  legal proceedings  in  order  to  provide  the  gaining  commander  with  some  context  for  victim behavior  and  to  facilitate  the  victim’s  access  to  advocacy,  healthcare,  MCIOs,  and  legal counsel (T-0). 11.6.2.1.  SARC  or  SAPR  VA  case  documents  will  not  be  transferred  to  the  gaining SARC without consent from the victim. 11.6.2.2.  The  receiving  commander  will  adopt  processes  to  assure  strict  confidentiality (T-0).  Only  the  immediate  commander  of  the  victim  will  be  notified  (T-0).  The immediate  commander  may  share  the  notification  with  the  senior  enlisted  advisor,  if deemed necessary to support the victim. All information shall be kept confidential to the extent authorized by law (T-0). Additional personnel will be notified by the commander only if they have direct input to the monthly CMG meeting (T-0). Every attempt must be 106 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 made to limit access to the information that a victim has been transferred into the unit as a result of a sexual assault report. 11.6.3.  If a victim transfers from the installation, then the processes in Table 11.6.3. apply as appropriate. Table 11.1.  Victim Transfer Processes. IF THEN 1.  The victim does NOT seek continued 3.  The CMG responsibility remains with the services of a SARC or SAPR VA at the new location, and 2.  The investigation or legal proceeding is ongoing at the original installation: The victim DOES seek SAPR services at the new  location: original installation’s CMG chair. 4.  The victim will be asked if she or he would like to receive the monthly update from the CMG meetings. 5.  If the victim wants the CMG updates, then the victim’s new commander will participate in person or call in to the CMG meetings and this call in will be documented in the minutes of the CMG. 6.  The new commander will provide the victim a monthly update of her or his case within 72 hours of the last CMG. 7.  The advocacy responsibility transfers to the  receiving SARC at the victim’s new installation  (if the victim consents to seek SAPR services at  new location), and then the CMG responsibility  may transfer to the new location. 8.  If the CMG does transfer to the location of the  victim, then the MCIOs at the original installation (if there is an ongoing investigation)  and the legal officer at the original installation  (if there are ongoing legal proceedings) are  required to call in to the CMG for the cases first CMG that the new location.  This MCIO and  legal officer call-in will be documented in the  CMG notes 9.  After the initial CMG, the local MCIO and legal officer will provide updates on the investigation and legal proceedings at each CMG until final disposition. AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 107 1.  The victim seeks SAPR services at 1.  The SARC at the new location must call in the new  location, and 2.  The Military Service determines that the CMG  should stay at the original installation: to the  CMG meeting at the original location to report  on victim services and any safety or retaliation-  related issues. This SARC call-in will be  documented in the CMG notes. 2.  The victim’s new commander must also call in to  the CMG meeting and must provide the victim a  monthly update of her or his case within 72  hours of the last CMG. 108 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 Chapter 12 JOINT BASES 12.1.  Overview.  On  April  16,  2008,  the  Deputy  Secretary  of  Defense  provided  command authorities and responsibilities supplemental guidance for implementing and operating a JB. Per the  Command  Authorities  and  Responsibilities  Guidance  para  4.1.5.11,  the  Supported Component  maintains  the  authority  and  responsibility  to  establish  a  SAPR  program.  Through this  supplemental  guidance  each  Service  was  to  maintain  its  own  SAPR  program.  There  are significant  differences  between  the  Services’  SAPR  programs,  including  but  not  limited  to training, coverage and reporting requirements.  In  addition  SAPR programs often interface with Service disciplinary programs. This chapter provides policy guidance for the AF SAPR program assigned to AF locations impacted by Joint Basing. 12.2.  Air  Force  Responsibilities.  In  regards  to  the  Joint  Bases,  with  AF  SAPR  personnel assigned (AF SARCs, SAPR VAs and VVAs), it is Air Force policy that: 12.2.1.  The AF Joint Base Commander (JBC) or the AF mission commander at each location where an AF SARC is assigned will maintain the implementation of the AF SAPR program and  operational  procedures  for  AF  personnel  assigned  to  that  Joint  Base  location  under  the direction of that location/supported commander (T-1). 12.2.2.  Where the AF is lead and serves as JBC, the AF Lead SARC will report directly to the  JBC  (T-1).  This  responsibility  may  be  delegated  to  the  Deputy  Joint  Base  Commander (DJBC).  12.2.2.1.  If  the  DJBC  is  from  a  sister  service,  and  this  responsibility  is  delegated,  the DJBC will follow and implement the SAPR program IAW with this AFI as well as attend the AF-taught WG/CC Course. AF SAPR personnel and AF assigned personnel will not under  any  circumstances  be  required  to  be  trained  or  to  implement  requirements  from another service’s SAPR program (T-1).  12.2.2.2.  If  the  AF  is  the  supported  component,  the  SARC  will  report  directly  to  the supported  WG/CC  (T-1).  The  supported  wing  commander  may  delegate this responsibility to the supported WG/CV but will not delegate it further (T-1). 12.2.2.3.  If  the  installation  has  multiple  Air  Force  SARCs  see  paragraph  1.4.4.2.  for designation of a Lead SARC.  12.2.2.3.1.  Lead SARC responsibilities are outlined in chapter 2.  12.2.2.3.2.  Wing, lead or location SARC, responsibilities will include: 12.2.2.3.2.1.  Direct  victim  services  to  include  victim  support  and  commander consultation; 12.2.2.3.2.2.  Manage  location  SAPR  office  to  include  the  direct  report  and supervision of assigned SAPR VAs; and, 12.2.2.3.2.3.  Conduct location specific CMG meetings IAW chapter 8. AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 109 12.2.2.4.  When  a  JBC  or  supported  WG/CC  requests  additional  SAPR  personnel  (e.g. SARCs  or  SAPR  VAs)  assigned  to  their  installation,  manning  requests  will  be coordinated through AF/CVS (T-1). 12.2.3.  The AF JBC will ensure that the installation has a 24 hour, 7 day per week response capability  (see  glossary)  (T-0).  All  victims  will  be  provided  an  immediate  SAPR  response regardless  of  service  affiliation  (T-0).  IAW  DoDI  6495.02,  Sexual  Assault  Prevention  and Response  Program  Procedures,  SAPR  personnel  will  ensure  a  safety  assessment  (see glossary)  is  conducted  at  the  time  of  initial  response  to  the  victim  regardless  of  service affiliation (T-0).  12.2.3.1.  Upon  receiving  notification  of  a  case,  SAPR  personnel  will  immediately provide SAPR services regardless of the victim’s service affiliation  (T-0). However, the SARC should speak with the victim to address transfer of case to the victim’s affiliated service. The SARC will transfer the case to the victim’s affiliated service ONLY with the victim’s consent (T-1). The victim may choose to remain with the Service providing the initial response; transfer of a case is not mandatory. 12.2.3.1.1.  When a VVA is assigned to provide advocacy, the VVA assigned will not be assigned to the same unit as the victim (T-1). 12.2.3.1.2.  The  SARC  from  the  service  affiliated  with  the  victim  will  enter  and maintain  case  management  and  DSAID  case  entry  unless  otherwise  requested  by written  victim  consent  (T-1).  When  an  installation  has  multiple  SARCs  assigned  to different  locations,  case  management  and  DSAID  entry  are  entered  by  the  location SARC conducted and entered by the assigned location SARC. 12.3.  Inter-service  Responsibilities.  In  regards  to  the  Joint  Bases,  there  are  responsibilities assigned  to  the  JBC  that  are  inter-service.  The  JBC  may  delegate  these  inter-service responsibilities to the DJBC. In the event the DJBC temporarily succeeds to command of the JB, the DJBC assumes these inter-service responsibilities. 12.3.1.  At  the  discretion  of  the  JBC,  a  joint  SAPR  hotline  may  be  developed  to  provide  a single number for all members of the installation that links the victim to the requested service SARC through an automated system. For example, “press 1 to speak to the Air Force SAPR office, press 2 for the Army SHARP office”. 12.3.1.1.  If  a  joint  hotline  is  implemented,  the  JBC  will  publish  standard  operating procedures  (SOPs)  that  require  each  victim  be  given  the  opportunity  to  have  their  case reported and managed by the victim’s affiliated service (T-1). 12.3.1.2.  The  AF  JBC  must  obtain  AF/CVS  approval  for  joint  hotline  SOPs  prior  to implementation (T-1). 12.3.1.2.1.  The AF JBC will ensure the joint hotline SOPs will require that the SARC and  SAPR  VA  assigned  to  a  victim  be  assigned  from  their  affiliated  service  unless otherwise requested by written victim consent (T-1). 12.3.2.  Joint  Bases  are  encouraged  to  collaborate  and  discuss  sharing  of  medical,  chaplain and  legal  services  available  to  sexual  assault  victims  on  the  installation  with  all  unit commanders  assigned,  to  include  our  sister  services.  However,  this  collaboration  cannot occur at the same time as case review during a case management. 110 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 12.3.3.  Joint Bases where the AF is the JBC, the CMG will be chaired by the  JBC and co-chaired by the AF SARC (T-1). This responsibility may be delegated to the DJBC, who will manage the CMG in accordance with this AFI (T-1). If there are multiple locations assigned to the installation, each location SARC will co-chair the CMG while conducting case review of victims assigned to their respective location (T-1). 12.3.3.1.  When reviewing opened victim cases during the CMG, personnel in the CMG will  be  limited  to  those  service  specific  members  as  described  in  Chapter  8  (T-1).  The CMG  will  ensure  specific  case  information  is  only  provided  to  the  CMG  chair,  SARC and  SAPR  VA  (T-1).  If  a  case  being  managed  is  from  a  victim  affiliated  with  a  sister service,  the  victim’s  unit  commander  (or  equivalent)  must  be  in  attendance  IAW  DoDI 6495.02, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program Procedures (T-0). If the unit commander is not assigned to the same location, electronic means (e.g. phone, VTC, etc.) may be utilized to facilitate their participation. 12.3.3.1.1.  The  victim’s  unit  commander,  regardless  of  service,  is  only  present during the discussion of the case involving a victim from their unit. Once the case has been reviewed that commander departs, and the next case is discussed. 12.3.3.2.  When having to establish a HRRT, the CMG chair will require the functional community  providing  services  to  the  victim  to  represent  their  functional  community  on the HRRT (T-0). See Chapter 8 for required HRRT members. 12.3.3.3.  All AF SARCs and SAPR VAs assigned to the installation will attend the CMG (T-0). If the installation assigns SAPR personnel by location, the SARC and SAPR VA is required to attend the CMG conducted at their assigned location. There is no requirement for a SARC to travel to another location SARC’s location to participate in their CMG. 12.3.3.4.  Sister Service certified SARCs and SAPR VAs may attend the CMG. However, other sister service members, as identified in Chapter 8, will only remain in attendance for victim cases that pertains to their service and unit (T-1). The CMG chair and co-chair will limit PII to those with a need to know (T-0). 12.3.4.  Joint Bases where the AF is the JBC, the JBC will collaborate with host WG/CC to ensure that the commander is informed when a victim of sexual assault from within the host wing  has  requested  an  ET  prior  to  rendering  the  final  decision  within  the  72  hour  time requirement (T-1).

Certification—Refers  to  the  process  by  which  the  Department  credentials  SARCs  and  SAPR VAs,  assesses  the  effectiveness  of  sexual  assault  advocacy  capabilities  using  a  competencies framework,  and  evaluates  and  performs  oversight  over  SARC  and  SAPR  VA  training.  The certification  criteria  are  established  by  the  Department  in  consultation  with  subject-matter experts. Case  Management  Group  (CMG)—A multi-disciplinary  group that meets  monthly to  review individual cases of sexual assault, chaired by the installation or host wing commander, this may be delegated to the vice wing commander but no further . This group facilitates monthly victim updates  and  directs  system  coordination,  accountability,  and  victim  access  to  quality  services. For unrestricted case review the CMG shall consist of the following:  Chair, SARC, SAPR VA, Chaplain, military criminal investigator, DoD law enforcement, DPH, SJA or designee if the SJA is unavailable, VWAP and victim’s commander, VVA and SVC. For restricted case review the CMG  membership  is  limited  to  all  SARCs  assigned  to  the  installation,  victim’s  SAPR  VA  or VVA, DPH, victims SVC and chaplain. Any deviations to this CMG for restricted cases must be approved by AF/CVS.  Collateral  Misconduct—Victim  misconduct  that  might  be  in  time,  place,  or  circumstance associated  with  the  victim’s  sexual  assault  incident.  Collateral  misconduct  by  the  victim  of  a sexual assault is one of the most significant barriers to reporting assault because of the victim’s fear of punishment. Some reported sexual assaults involve circumstances where the victim may have  engaged  in  some  form  of  misconduct  (e.g.,  underage  drinking  or  other  related  alcohol offenses, adultery, fraternization, or other violations of certain regulations or orders). Consent—Words or overt acts indicating a freely given agreement to the sexual conduct at issue by a competent person. An expression of lack of consent through words or conduct means there is  no consent.  Lack of verbal  or physical  resistance or submission  resulting from  the accused’s use  of  force,  threat  of  force,  or  placing  another  person  in  fear  does  not  constitute  consent.  A current  or  previous  dating  relationship  or  the  manner  of  dress  of  the  person  involved  with  the accused in the sexual conduct at issue shall not constitute consent. There is no consent where the person is sleeping or incapacitated, such as due to age, alcohol or drugs, or mental incapacity. 118 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 Covered  Communication—Verbal,  written,  or  electronic  communications  of  personally identifiable information  concerning a sexual  assault victim or alleged offender provided by the victim  to  the  Sexual  Assault  Response  Coordinator  (SARC),  SAPR  Victim  Advocate  (SAPR VA),  Volunteer  Victim  Advocate  (VVA)  or  Healthcare  Personnel  related  to  his  or  her  sexual assault. Credible  Information—Information that, considering the source and nature of the information and the totality of the circumstances, is sufficiently believable to presume that the fact or facts in question are true. Credible  Report—Either  a  written  or  verbal  report  made  in  support  of  an  Expedited  Transfer that is determined to have credible information. Defense  Sexual  Assault  Incident  Database—A  DoD  database  that  captures  uniform  data provided by the Military Services and maintains all sexual assault data collected by the Military Services. This  database  shall be a centralized, case-level  database  for the uniform  collection of data  regarding  incidence  of  sexual  assaults  involving  persons  covered  by  this  Directive  and Reference (c). DSAID will include information when available, or when not limited by restricted reporting,  or  otherwise  prohibited  by  law,  about  the  nature  of  the  assault,  the  victim,  the offender, and the disposition of reports associated with the assault. DSAID shall be available to the  SAPRO  and  the  DoD  to  develop  and  implement  congressional  reporting  requirements. Unless  authorized  by  law,  or  needed  for  internal  DoD  review  or  analysis,  disclosure  of  data stored in DSAID will only be granted when disclosure is ordered by a military, Federal, or State judge  or  other  officials  or  entities  as  required  by  a  law  or  applicable  U.S.  international agreement.

Personnel  who  otherwise  fall  under  this  definition  may  perform duties  that  are  not  healthcare  related  such  as  command  or  supervisory  duties.  When  doing  so, they  are  not  “Healthcare  Personnel”  for  the  purposes  of  receiving  a  restricted  report  unless  a victim  notifies  them  he  or  she  intends  to  make  a  restricted  report  to  them  as  a  provider  not  a member of their chain of command. Healthcare providers may include, but are not limited to:   Licensed physicians practicing in the MHS with clinical privileges in obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, urology, general medical AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 119 officer, flight surgeon, psychiatrists, or those having clinical privileges to perform pelvic examinations or treat mental health conditions.

Non-Personally Identifying Information (non-PII)—Includes those facts and circumstances surrounding the sexual assault incident or information about the individual that enables the identity of the victim or alleged offender to remain anonymous. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)—This term applies to the alleged victim or alleged offender in a sexual assault, and is that information which would disclose or have a tendency to disclose the person’s identity. Identifying personal information includes the person’s name or a particularly identifying description (e.g., physical characteristics or identity by position, rank, or organization), or other information about the person or the facts and circumstances involved that could reasonably be understood to identify the person (e.g., a female in a particular squadron or barracks when there is only one female assigned). Qualifying Conviction—For the purposes of this Instruction, a State or Federal conviction for a felony crime of sexual assault or any general or special court-martial conviction for a UCMJ offense which otherwise meets the elements of a crime of sexual assault, even though not classified as a felony or misdemeanor.  Report—While a sexual assault victim can disclose information to many personnel, an official report is made only when a DD Form 2910 is filed with a SARC or SAPR VA, or when an MCIO begins an independent investigation. For restricted and unrestricted reporting purposes, a report can be made to healthcare personnel, but healthcare personnel then immediately contact the SARC or SAPR VA to fill out the DD Form 2910. Chaplains and military attorneys cannot take official reports. Reprisal—Taking or threatening to take an unfavorable personnel action, or withholding or threatening to withhold a favorable personnel action, for making, preparing to make, or being perceived as making or preparing to make a protected communication. Responders—Includes first responders, who are generally composed of personnel in the following disciplines or positions:  SARCs, SAPR VAs, healthcare personnel, law enforcement, and MCIOs. Other responders are judge advocates, chaplains, and commanders, but they are usually not first responders.  Respond, response, or response capability—All locations, including deployed areas, have a 24 hour, 7 day per week sexual assault response capability. The SARC shall be notified, respond, or direct a SAPR VA to respond, assign a SAPR VA, and offer the victim healthcare treatment and a SAFE. In geographic locations where there is no SARC onsite, the on-call SAPR VA shall 120 AFI90-6001  21 MAY 2015 respond, offer the victim healthcare treatment and a SAFE, and immediately notify the SARC of the sexual assault. The initial response is general composed of personnel in the following disciplines or positions: SARCs, SAPR VAs, healthcare personnel, law enforcement, and MCIOs. Other responders are judge advocates, chaplains, and commanders. When victims are geographically detached from a military installation, the SARC or SAPR VA will refer to local civilian providers or the DoD Safe Helpline for resources. Retaliation— 1. The taking or threatening to take an adverse personnel action, or withholding or threatening to withhold a favorable personnel action, with respect to a military member because the member reported a criminal offense or; 2. Ostracizing a military member, to include excluding from social acceptance, privilege or friendship with the intent to discourage reporting of a criminal offense or otherwise discourage the due administration of justice or; 3. Maltreating a military member, to include treatment by peers or by other persons, that, when viewed objectively under all the circumstances, is abusive or otherwise unnecessary for any unlawful purpose, that is done with the intent to discourage reporting of a criminal offense or otherwise discourage the due administration of justice, and that results in physical or mental harm or suffering, or reasonably could have caused physical or mental harm or suffering. Restricted Reporting—A process used by a Service member to report or disclose that he or she is the victim of a sexual assault to specified officials on a requested confidential basis. Under these circumstances, the victim’s report and any details provided to the SARC, Healthcare Personnel, or a VA will not be reported to law enforcement to initiate an official investigation unless the victim consents or an established exception is exercised under DoDD 6495.01. (SAPR restricted reports require a signed DD Form 2910) Re-victimization——A pattern wherein the victim of abuse or crime has a statistically higher tendency to be victimized again, either shortly thereafter or much later in adulthood in the case of abuse as a child. This latter pattern is particularly notable in cases of sexual abuse. Safety Assessment—An assessment performed by personnel appointed by the CMG chair to determine if a sexual assault victim is in immediate danger of harm. The non-clinical safety assessment will evaluate the following areas from the perspective of the victim, including, but not limited to:  concerns for the victim's safety; the subject's access to the victim and any concern of stalking; previous or existing relationship or friendship between the subject and the victim, the victim's spouse, or victim's children; a threat, attempt, or plan by the victim or subject to commit suicide; the use, threat, or access of a suspect to a weapon; serious injury sustained by the victim; the subject's history of law enforcement involvement regarding domestic abuse, assault, or other criminal behavior; a CPO or MPO against the subject, or violation of such an order; history of drug or alcohol abuse by either the subject or victim; the demonstration by the subject of erratic or obsessive behavior, rage, agitation, or instability; and flight risk of the suspect. Sexual Assault—Intentional sexual contact characterize by use of force, threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority, or when the victim does not or cannot consent. The term includes a broad category of sexual offenses consisting of the following specific UCMJ offenses: rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual contact, abusive sexual contact, forcible sodomy (forced oral or anal sex), or attempts to commit any of these acts.

Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC)—The single point of contact at an installation or within a geographic area who oversees sexual assault awareness, prevention, and response training; coordinates medical treatment, including emergency care for sexual assault victims covered under this AFI; and tracks the services provided to a victim of sexual assault, covered under this AFI, from the initial report through final disposition and resolution. Special Victims’ Counsel—attorneys who are assigned to provide legal assistance to sexual assault victims through independent representation; builds and sustains victim resiliency; empowers victims; increases the level of legal assistance provided to victims. Trauma Informed Care—An approach to engage people with histories of trauma that recognizes the presence of trauma symptoms and acknowledges the role that trauma has played in their lives. Trauma-informed services are based on an understanding of the vulnerabilities or triggers of trauma survivors that traditional service delivery approaches may exacerbate, so that these services and programs can be more supportive and avoid re-traumatization. Unrestricted Reporting—A process that an individual covered by this policy uses to disclose, without requesting confidentiality or restricted reporting, that he or she is the victim of a sexual assault. Under these circumstances, the victim’s report and any details provided to the SARC, Healthcare Personnel, a VA, command authorities, or other persons are reported to law enforcement and may be used to initiate the official investigation process. (SAPR unrestricted reports require a signed DD Form 2910) Victim—For the purpose of this Instruction, a victim is a person who alleges direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of a sexual assault and who has a connection with the installation. If the victim is incompetent or incapacitated, the term “victim” includes one of the following representatives (in preferred order): spouse, legal guardian, parent, child, sibling, another family member, or another person designated by a court. Victims will be eligible for and provided services by the Air Force consistent with their legal status. The services contemplated range from referral to the appropriate civilian or foreign agency to the provision of all services available to an AD member. Nothing in this policy shall be construed to authorize or require the provision of specific services (such as medical care or therapeutic counseling) unless the victim has an independent entitlement to such services under relevant statutes or Department of Defense directives. The terms “victim” and “alleged victim” have the same meaning and are interchangeable in this Instruction. Volunteer Victim Advocate (VVA)—Military and DoD civilian employees who are selected, trained and credentialed to provide non-clinical crisis intervention, referral, and ongoing non-clinical support to adult sexual assault victims. Support will include providing information on available options and resources to victims.
