Purpose. The purpose of this directive is to implement federal law which assigns NTSB and FAAresponsibility or interest in certain mishaps involving military aircraft. 1.1.1.  Because various agencies and departments have differing policies and procedures regardingwitnesses, analysis and the release of information, a joint military-civil investigation with sharedresponsibility is not possible. 1.1.2.  This directive strives to foster cooperation during the investigations of aircraft mishaps involv-ing both civil and military aircraft, while adhering to the unique requirements of civil and militaryinvestigations. 1.1.3.  Since the common goal of safety investigations is mishap prevention, cooperation between mil-itary and civil agencies is both logical and desirable. 1.2.  Responsibility. The Air Force Chief of Safety (HQ USAF/SE) is the executive agent for thisinterservice publication. Each participant uses component-unique publications to implement this instruc-tion. If a participant alters these policies or procedures because of unique operating procedures, it indi-cates applicability to that service or agency only. 1.2.1.  Changes to this publication should be sent to HQ Air Force Safety Center (AFSC)/Plans andPrograms Division (SEP), 9700 G Avenue SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5670. 1.3.  Types of Investigations. An aircraft mishap can precipitate multiple investigations for alternate pur-poses and under separate authorities. 1.3.1.  Mishaps are investigated for two primary reasons; 1) to determine the cause (s) of the mishapto prevent the recurrence of like mishaps, and 2) to satisfy legal or administrative concerns. 1.3.1.1.  A safety investigation promotes aviation safety by identifying mishap circumstances (i.e.,hazards) which, if eliminated or reduced, could prevent the recurrence of the mishap. A safetyinvestigation recommends corrective actions to reduce or eliminate hazards. 1.3.1.2.  Other investigations may be conducted by military authorities and others for a variety ofpurposes, such as providing a basis for administrative or judicial proceeding, claims or entitle-ments. An administrative investigation may conclude culpability and may recommend punitiveaction. 1.3.2.  Depending on the circumstances of the mishap, jurisdictions of both civil and military authori-ties may apply simultaneously. 1.3.2.1.  The military derives its authority to investigate mishaps from the statutory and inherentauthority of the respective service secretary. Procedures for mishap reporting and investigation,and policies on the release of information are contained in respective service implementing direc-tives listed in Attachment 1. 1.3.2.2.  Title 49, U.S.C. Chapter 11 assigns the NTSB the responsibility to investigate civil air-craft mishaps within the United States, its territories and possessions, including those involvingboth a civil and military aircraft. The NTSB is a separate federal agency, independent of theAFI91-206(I)   8 JULY 20045Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Transportation (DOT) and Department of Home-land Security (DHS). A NTSB aircraft investigation has priority over any other investigation byanother federal agency or department. Concurrent investigations are not joint with the NTSB andmay not interfere with NTSB activities. The NTSB has subpoena power to compel a witness’statement or testimony. NTSB procedures for investigations and reporting are contained in Title49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapter VIII, Parts 800 et seq., Parts 830 (Notification)and 831 (Investigation). 1.3.3.  This directive discusses three types of investigations; the NTSB accident investigation, the mil-itary mishap safety investigation, and the military mishap administrative investigation. 1.3.3.1.  The NTSB accident investigation is conducted in the public interest to promote aviationsafety. NTSB proceedings differ from military investigations especially in the areas regarding wit-nesses and information release. In a NTSB investigation a witness can be subpoenaed to appearbefore the Board to provide a statement or testimony, but the witness cannot be compelled toincriminate themselves, the witness is entitled to representation or counsel, and the witness’ state-ment or testimony is not privileged and relevant portions become part of the NTSB’s public inves-tigation record. The NTSB’s report, cause determination and recommended corrective actions arepublic records, but are not admissible in court as evidence. 1.3.3.2.  The military mishap safety investigation is an internal inquiry by the respective serviceconducted solely for the purpose of mishap prevention. In soliciting information from personnelinvolved in the mishap, the investigative board may grant a promise of confidentiality to a witnessto assure them that the information they provide will only be used to prevent further mishaps andwill not be released for any other purpose. Portions of a military safety investigation report containprivileged information and documents, not releasable to the public. 1.3.3.3.  The military mishap administrative investigation is conducted apart from a military mis-hap safety investigation. Such investigations may take a variety of forms, and may involve witnesstestimony under oath. Witnesses may be represented by counsel and must be informed of theirrights against self-incrimination if they are suspected of a criminal offense. Statements may gener-ally be admitted as evidence against the witness or used in any other manner. The military admin-istrative investigation and report satisfy the requirement for legal and administrativedocumentation of a mishap. The report meets the requirement for legal sufficiency and is releas-able to the NTSB, the FAA, and the public. 1.4.  Security. Security matters are administered according to military service regulations. 1.4.1.  The commander of the unit to which the mishap aircraft was assigned, the commander of thenearest military installation, and the commander conducting the investigation are responsible for thesecurity of any classified material associated with the mishap. 1.4.2.  The senior member of the military investigation board (i.e., the board president) is responsiblefor ensuring all board participants that have access to classified material have the appropriate securityclearance. 1.4.3.  In a NTSB investigation, the military coordinator provides liaison for security matters betweenthe NTSB Investigator-in-Charge (IIC) and the appropriate military authority. 6AFI91-206(I)   8 JULY 20041.4.4.  In a mishap involving classified material, military authorities must identify an appropriateaccess level so the NTSB and FAA may assign personnel with the appropriate clearances. Not allNTSB and FAA personnel hold security clearances. 1.4.4.1.  Official notification from the NTSB and the FAA to military authorities of the clearancesagency personnel hold and the presentation of agency credentials will constitute evidence of clear-ance. 1.4.5.  In a NTSB investigation not all participants may have security clearances. If classified materialis involved, the military authority and the NTSB will determine if such material is central or incidentalto the mishap, and take appropriate actions to limit access to the material to those personnel with theappropriate clearance and need to know. AFI91-206(I)   8 JULY 20047NTSB INVESTIGATION WITH MILITARY PARTICIPATION Chapter 2     2.1.  General. A mishap involving both civil and military aircraft will precipitate a NTSB investigation.Military investigations for safety or legal purposes may proceed concurrently, but the NTSB may exercisefirst claim on evidence. To assist these separate investigations, it is important that nonprivileged informa-tion concerning the mishap be exchanged promptly and completely. 2.1.1.  NTSB proceedings differ from military investigations, however, the NTSB’s experience ininvestigations of general and commercial aviation accidents has established the validity of its method. 2.2.  Organization. The NTSB IIC will organize the investigation in a manner considered expedient todevelop evidence. Organization is flexible and may be adjusted as lines of inquiry conclude or new topicsopen. 2.2.1.  The IIC will usually form groups, each chaired by a NTSB investigator, to concentrate on spe-cific topics appropriate to the aircraft or mishap. Examples would be groups for operations, airframe,powerplants, weather, or human factors. 2.3.  Participation. The NTSB will admit into its investigation individuals or representatives of govern-ment agencies, corporations, or associations whose personnel, products or services were involved in themishap. 2.3.1.  By law, the FAA may exercise party status in NTSB aviation investigations, and a military ser-vice may also exercise party status in the NTSB investigation of a mishap involving that service’s air-craft. 2.3.2.  Additional parties may be admitted at the IIC’s discretion, as he determines a need for technicalexpertise or the unique knowledge a party can provide. Claimants’ or insurers’ representatives are notadmitted to the investigation. 2.3.3.  Participation in the investigation does not include admission to NTSB analysis to determinecause and formulate corrective action. 2.3.4.  A party to an investigation is a company or agency with specific knowledge or skill needed bythe NTSB to perform the investigation. Parties furnish a coordinator to work with the IIC, and special-ists to one or more specialized investigative groups at an accident scene. 2.3.5.  The IIC may relieve a party from participating in the investigation for nonperformance or con-duct prejudicial to the investigation. 2.4.  Witnesses. The NTSB has subpoena power and can compel a witness to appear before its fieldinvestigator, at a public hearing, or formal deposition, to provide a statement or testimony, but it cannotcompel the witness to provide incriminating statements or testimony. 2.4.1.  A witness providing a statement to a field investigator is not normally sworn, however a wit-ness at a public hearing or formal deposition testifies under oath. In either case the witness is advisedof the investigation’s purpose. 2.4.2.  Any statement or testimony becomes part of the investigation record. 8AFI91-206(I)   8 JULY 20042.4.3.  A witness may be accompanied or advised by counsel or a representative of his choice. 2.4.4.  Depending on the format used by the IIC or group chairman, parties may be allowed to attendinterviews and questioning of witnesses. 2.5.  Investigation Sequence. An NTSB investigation usually proceeds as follows. 2.5.1.  Field Investigation. The IIC, group chair, and parties gather at a location near the mishap site.A Member of the NTSB proper may also be present if the mishap is of national significance or widepubic interest. 2.5.1.1.  The IIC will hold an organizational meeting, exclude any whom he does not wish to admitas parties to the investigation, summarize available information, appoint groups, and assign tasks. 2.5.1.2.  The field investigation encompasses wreckage examination, component disassembly,data or record retrieval, and witness interviews. Such activities may involve travel to other loca-tions as the IIC or group chair considers appropriate. 2.5.1.3.  The IIC will hold a daily progress meeting of all parties involved to hear group chairpresent evidence and to direct further activities. 2.5.1.4.  The field investigation will adjourn when the IIC is satisfied of its sufficiency. The chairof each group will assemble a factual report for the IIC’s inclusion in the investigation record. 2.5.2.  Research and Component Examination. The NTSB’s engineering staff and laboratory can per-form scientific examination of material exhibits and conduct performance research. Additionally,NTSB technical specialists can decipher and display various recorded data (i.e., radar, voice, and datarecorders) for the investigators’ use. 2.5.2.1.  An engineering or technical project by the NTSB will be documented in a factual reportwhich becomes part of the investigation record. 2.5.3.  Public Hearing. As appropriate, a hearing may be convened to conduct part of the inquiry in apublic forum. Parties to the investigation are included in the hearing. 2.5.4.  Determining Cause. Analysis to determine the cause(s) of the mishap is conducted internallyamong NTSB personnel only (i.e., IIC, group chair, engineering and technical staffs). This process isclosed to parties. 2.5.4.1.  Parties may submit written positions drawn from the evidence to propose findings, aprobable cause or causes, and recommendations. These submissions become part of the investiga-tion record. The Board considers the body of evidence, its staff’s analysis and any submissions, toassign factor and probable cause. 2.6.  Recommendations. When it finds an opportunity to promote aviation safety, the Board recommendscorrective action(s) to appropriate agencies, corporations or associations. 2.6.1.  Parties may make written submissions proposing corrective action(s). 2.7.  Board Meeting. For an accident of national significance or wide public interest, a public BoardMeeting may be convened after the investigation has been concluded, but before the investigation reportis released. AFI91-206(I)   8 JULY 200492.7.1.  NTSB personnel summarize evidence and may present analysis. 2.7.2.  The Board will consider and vote upon findings, recommendations, and the probable cause(s). 2.7.3.  Parties, the press and the public may attend. 2.7.4.  A videotape of the Board Meeting is placed in the public docket for the investigation, alongwith the aircraft accident report (AAR). 2.8.  Mishap Information.  2.8.1.  Press and Public Relations. The NTSB responds to press and public interest in its investigationwith prepared releases or through a selected spokesman. Only the IIC, the Member present at the mis-hap scene, or the NTSB Office of Public Affairs may publicly release information concerning findingsor the conduct of the investigation. 2.8.2.  Reports. The NTSB staff writes and assembles the AAR which may include factual reports bygroup chair and NTSB engineers or technicians, photographs, diagrams, witness statements, and cop-ies of documents which illuminate the accident circumstances. 2.8.2.1.  The AAR, its determination of cause and its proposals for corrective action are publicrecords, as are any communications to the Board concerning the investigation. 2.8.2.2.  Investigators’ intermediate work products (e.g., notes, excess photographs and unuseddocuments), and the Board’s analysis are not releasable and are destroyed when no longer neededfor the investigation. 2.8.2.3.  Information which is proprietary, classified, or would unduly violate an individual’s pri-vacy is not releasable. The latter is not equivalent to privilege protection. 2.8.2.4.  The Board considers its cases to always remain open. It will accept new evidence at anytime and will, if appropriate, reconsider its findings and recommendations in light of the new evi-dence. 2.9.  Notification. The military commander having first knowledge of a mishap involving both civil andmilitary aircraft will notify the appropriate service headquarters and safety center by telephone and thenby message in accordance with service directives. 2.9.1.  The military safety center will relay pertinent mishap information to the NTSB by telephoneand by confirming message. 2.9.2.  The NTSB or FAA will notify the appropriate service headquarters and military safety centerwhen its personnel report a mishap involving both civil and military aircraft. 2.10.  Responsibilities. The military safety center elects whether to participate in a NTSB investigationand informs the NTSB, the involved military commanders and military investigative boards. 2.10.1.  If participating, the safety center appoints a military coordinator and personnel to take part inthe investigative groups. 2.10.1.1.  The military coordinator and personnel appointed to take part in the investigative groupsshall not have responsibility for conducting a concurrent investigation into the mishap. 10AFI91-206(I)   8 JULY 20042.10.2.  Once the military participants have been identified the safety center notifies the NTSB,involved military commanders and investigative boards, of the appointment of the coordinator andother party members. 2.10.3.  Prior to the Board’s consideration of probable cause or recommendations, the safety centermay submit proposed findings drawn from the evidence, proposed probable cause(s), and proposedsafety recommendations. 2.10.4.  Military commanders will provide all reasonable assistance to the federal agencies conductinginvestigations. 2.10.5.  The military coordinator serves as the service’s principal representative to the NTSB investi-gation. The coordinator will contact the IIC, attend the field investigation and assist as the IIC directs. 2.10.5.1.  The coordinator will be the focal point for passing nonprivileged information betweenthe NTSB and the concurrent military investigation(s). 2.10.5.2.  The coordinator will arrange with the appropriate military authority access to personnel,data, records, or facilities as necessary to support the NTSB investigation. 2.10.5.3.  The coordinator supervises the military party to the investigation and conducts periodicmeetings of assigned personnel to stay abreast of evidence developed or any difficulties encoun-tered among the groups. AFI91-206(I)   8 JULY 200411MILITARY INVESTIGATION WITH NTSB OR FAA PARTICIPATION Chapter 3     3.1.  General. A military aircraft mishap without civil aircraft involvement will be investigated by per-sonnel from the appropriate military service. These same personnel will determine cause(s) from the evi-dence gathered, recommend corrective action(s), and create a report of their investigation and analysis. 3.2.  Participation. By law, military authorities must provide for participation by the Secretary of Trans-portation in the military investigation of a mishap in which a duty of the Secretary may be involved. 3.2.1.  The NTSB may have an interest when the above duty is an FAA function applicable to civilaviation. 3.2.2.  Participation may be extended to the NTSB when military authority deems it could contributeto aviation safety. 3.2.3.  The NTSB and FAA may decline to participate. 3.2.4.  The concept of party status (i.e., participation) as used in the context of a NTSB investigationis not defined in military services’ directives governing military mishap investigations and reporting. 3.2.4.1.  Service directives provide for investigative boards’ use of scientists, engineers, technicalexperts or manufactures’ representatives. 3.2.4.2.  Personnel, unless appointed, should not be in interviews with witnesses providing a state-ment under a promise of confidentiality, board deliberations on privileged information, or creationof the investigation report. 3.2.4.3.  In view of the above, participation in a mishap investigation under military authority isconstrued to mean attendance and active assistance in any portion of the investigation except thosein which the investigative board obtains, analyzes or reports privileged information. 3.2.5.  Circumstances which may invoke NTSB or FAA participation in a military investigation are: 3.2.5.1.  A mishap involving military aircraft or component equipment with a civilian equivalent. 3.2.5.2.  A mishap involving an operation applicable to civil aviation. 3.2.5.3.  A mishap involving an FAA function. 3.2.6.  Military authorities should consider FAA involvement if any of the following apply to the mis-hap: 3.2.6.1.  Performance of an FAA employee or designee. 3.2.6.2.  FAA certification of a civilian crewmember, air agency, or operator. 3.2.6.3.  FAA design or airworthiness certification. 3.2.6.4.  Navigation or airport facility established, operated or maintained by the FAA; by anotheragency for the FAA; or by any non-government entity when intended for use by aircraft in theNational Airspace System. 3.2.6.5.

The military commander having first knowledge of a military aircraft mishap notifiesthe appropriate service headquarters and safety center in accordance with service directives. 3.3.1.  If FAA involvement is known or considered likely, the commander will remark the same in hisinitial notification. 3.3.2.  The senior member of a military investigation board will notify his appointing commander andthe service safety center if during an investigation the board finds FAA involvement or considers itlikely. 3.3.3.  The service safety center will notify the FAA and the NTSB by telephone and confirming mes-sage on obtaining notice of known, or likely, FAA involvement. 3.4.  Responsibilities.  3.4.1.  Military commanders have notification responsibilities. 3.4.2.  The service safety center will determine whether the NTSB may have an interest in the investi-gation. 3.4.3.  The safety center will provide the FAA and the NTSB the opportunity to participate in theinvestigation according to each agency’s respective involvement or interest. 3.4.4.  The NTSB and the FAA will acknowledge notification, and indicate their respective intentionsto participate. 3.4.4.1.  If the NTSB or FAA elect to participate they will identify any personnel assigned to theinvestigation to the service safety center and appropriate military authority. 3.4.5.  The senior member of the investigative board with FAA or NTSB participants will superviseand direct their activities during the course of the investigation. 3.5.  Witness Testimony and Privileged Proceedings or Reports. Service personnel conducting asafety investigation may grant a promise of confidentiality when interviewing a witness or soliciting awritten statement. 3.5.1.  A witness’ oral or written statement is not taken under oath, nor does counsel normally repre-sent the witness. AFI91-206(I)   8 JULY 2004133.5.2.  A witness is free to give opinion or speculation. 3.5.3.  NTSB and FAA participants are not normally privy to confidential witness interviews, unlessthe senior member of the military board deems their expertise essential to the interview, and the ser-vice safety center approves. 3.5.4.  NTSB and FAA participants may not attend safety board deliberations, but may submit recom-mended findings for the safety board’s consideration. 3.5.5.  Privileged documents (i.e., witness statements, records of board analysis, conclusions or rec-ommendations) may not be provided to NTSB or FAA participants. 3.6.  Press and Public Relations. Only personnel acting under their respective service directives mayrelease information on the progress or outcome of the military investigation. 3.7.  NTSB and FAA Participation. NTSB and FAA representatives may be expected to provide broadknowledge of their agencies and to support the investigative board with access to agency personnel forinterviews, topical information, and records. 3.7.1.  NTSB and FAA representatives may be expected to pass information to their agencies whichapplies to civil aviation. 3.7.2.  FAA participants in a military safety investigation may not take part in another associatedinvestigation or enforcement action. 3.7.2.1.  This does not prevent the FAA from taking action on violations of Federal Aviation Reg-ulations. Other FAA personnel would be appointed to gather evidence and prepare an action. 3.7.3.  Copies of nonprivileged documents used in the military investigation may be provided to theNTSB and FAA participants as the senior member sees fit. 3.8.  Reports. A mishap safety investigation report may be released only as prescribed by the departmentsecretary having custody of the report. 3.8.1.  If during the investigation, the board identifies a hazard which requires immediate action on thepart of civil aviation, the senior member will expeditiously report the hazard apart from its mishapcontext to the service safety center for passage to the appropriate action agency. 3.8.2.  An investigative board’s conclusion attributing cause to another agency or recommendation ofcorrective action by another agency may be released only by the military service headquarters. 14AFI91-206(I)   8 JULY 2004Chapter 4     EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION 4.1.  General. If an accident involves only military aircraft and a duty of the Secretary (DOT) is or maybe involved, the military authorities shall provide for the participation of the Secretary. In any other acci-dents involving only military aircraft, the military authorities shall give the Board (NTSB) or Secretary(DOT) information the military authorities decide would contribute to the promotion of air safety. 4.1.1.  Service directives restrict the release of findings or recommendations. An investigative board’sconclusion attributing cause to another agency or recommendation of corrective action by anotheragency may be released only by the service headquarters. 4.1.2.  A military mishap safety investigation report may not be disseminated. Nonprivileged portionsmay be extracted and released according to respective service policy. 4.1.3.  Other investigations may be releasable to other agencies and the public when so authorized bythe military service. 4.1.4.  A service safety center will transmit to the FAA, the NTSB or others as necessary, a report of ahazard requiring immediate action by a component of civil aviation. 4.1.5.  Information of interest to the NTSB and FAA. Each military safety center evaluates informa-tion gathered from various reports it receives and provides the NTSB and the FAA that information itconsiders useful in promoting aviation safety. Information such as: 4.1.5.1.  Data derived on the basis of comparable models, components or systems in civil aviation,or experience in similar operations. 4.1.5.2.
