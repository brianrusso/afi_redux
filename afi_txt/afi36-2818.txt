SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  document  is  substantially  revised  and  must  be  reviewed  in  its  entirety.    This  revision includes  the  removal  of  the  six  month  time-on-station  requirement  for  Individual  Logistics Readiness Awards (originally para 6.1.2.5).  Additionally, a requirement for qualitative data was added  to  award  package  criteria  for  the  General  Wilbur  L.  Creech  Maintenance  Excellence Award,  (para’s  3.1.1.3,  3.1.1.5,  3.1.1.5.1).    The  Dr.  James  G.  Roche  Sustainment  Excellence Award  has  been  transferred  to  SAF/AQ  for  execution  for  the  2017  award  period.    Information pertaining to this award has been removed from this publication.  The Surface Distribution and Deployment  Command  (SDDC)  Award  for  Excellence  in  Traffic  Management  was  eliminated and therefore removed from this publication.  Words following headers on the same line are not authorized.    An  acronym  list  is  required  for  all  awards.    All  Maintenance  and  Logistics Readiness award packages and citations will be uploaded to the AF/A4L Enterprise Information Site  (EIS)  in  PDF  format  to  SharePoint:  https://cs.eis.af.mil/sites/10820/default.aspx).

The CSAF has approved two awards to promote maintenance excellence at the MAJCOM and Program Office level.  These awards are based  on  performance  over  the  past  fiscal  year  and  reward  the  organization  (MAJCOM  and Program  Office)  that  demonstrates  the  most  significant  improvement  in  fleet  health  and  asset management from the previous fiscal year. 3.1.1.  Gen Wilbur L. Creech Maintenance Excellence Award. 3.1.1.1.  Background.    This  award  recognizes  the  MAJCOM  demonstrating  the  most improved  performance  in  overall  fleet  health  over  the  past  fiscal  year.    The  award consists of a quantitative metrics analysis performed by AF/A4LM and is complemented by a qualitative analysis provided by the MAJCOM. 3.1.1.2.  Eligibility.    All  MAJCOMs  are  eligible  for  this  award.    The  AF/A4LM  will provide  MAJCOM  POCs  a  quantitative  analysis  of  performance  by  NLT  1  January following the close out of the prior FY.  MAJCOMs will use this quantitative data to fill in  section  1  of  an  AF  Form  1206.    No  other  supporting  data  on  the  AF  Form  1206  is required for the quantitative section. MAJCOMs are only required to provide qualitative assessment inputs in section 2 of the award, per the criteria instructions listed below. 3.1.1.3.  Criteria.    MAJCOMs  who  would  like  to  submit  nominations  for  the  General Creech  Award  will  submit  an  AF  Form  1206  with  a  Section  1  titled  “Quantitative Analysis” (data to be provided directly by AF/A4LM) and a Section 2 titled “Qualitative Analysis.”  The Qualitative Analysis should consist of a maximum of 10 total lines, with single  or  multiple  line  bullets,  to  add  context  to  the  data.                The  overall  MAJCOM winner  is  determined  by  evaluating  both  quantitative,  (provided  by  AF/A4LM)  and qualitative  data,  (provided  by  the  MAJCOM).    MAJCOM  AF  Form  1206  submission suspense to AF/A4LM is 15 March. 3.1.1.4.  Section  1,  “Quantitative  Analysis”  (Total  Overall  Weighted  Factor  .50).  AF/A4LM  will  provide  a  comparison  of  FY  metrics,  (pulled  directly  from  LIMS-EV), and calculate the overall improvement, (at the MAJCOM aggregate level), then multiply each metric by a corresponding weighted value.  AF/A4LM will e-mail MAJCOM POCs the metrics which should be cut and pasted directly into a MAJCOM-generated AF Form 1206.    The  metrics  evaluated  by  AF/A4LM  are:  Aircraft  Availability  (AA)  Rate, Maintenance Man Hour per Flight Hour (MMH/FH), Mission Capable (MC) Rate, Total Not Mission Capable Maintenance (TNMCM) Rate, Total  Not Mission Capable Supply (TNMCS) Rate and Cannibalization (CANN) Rate. 3.1.1.4.1.  AA Rate (Weight Factor = .25) 3.1.1.4.2.  MMH/FH (Weight Factor = .10) 3.1.1.4.3.  MC Rate (Weight Factor = .25) 3.1.1.4.4.  TNMCM Rate (Weight Factor = .15) AFI36-2818  23 JUNE 2017 19 3.1.1.4.5.  TNMCS Rate (Weight Factor = .15) 3.1.1.4.6.  CANN Rate (Weight Factor = .10) 3.1.1.5.  Section 2: “Qualitative Analysis” (Total Overall Weighted Factor .50).  Because the  intent  of  the  Gen  Wilbur  L.  Creech  Maintenance  Excellence  Award  is  to  recognize the MAJCOM demonstrating the most improved performance in aircraft maintenance and fleet health, a qualitative analysis must accompany the quantitative analysis in Section 1. 3.1.1.5.1.  The  “Qualitative  Analysis”  (Section  2  on  the  AF  Form  1206)  should consist  of  a  maximum  of  10  total  lines,  with  single  or  multiple  line  bullets,  to  add context  to  the  data.    The  10  total  line  narrative  should  demonstrate  the  initiatives implemented  by  the  MAJCOMs  that  led  to  the  improvements  in  overall  metrics outlined in the quantitative section.  Examples of items to include in the narrative: 1) reliability, maintainability, and supportability improvements that led to improvements in  MMH/FH,  MC,  or  decreases  in  TNMCM/S  rates,  2)  demonstrated  cost  reduction actions  taken  either  through  the  introduction  of  innovation  at  the  unit-level,  which became  adopted/championed  by  the  MAJCOM  and/or,  3)  actions  taken  that demonstrate  improvements  in  AA  and/or  MC  such  as  improvements  pertaining  to depot  repair  cycle  times  or  customer  wait  times,  4)  demonstrations  of  effective technology  insertion  in  either  process/product  that  led  to  improvements  in  overall weapons  systems  sustainment  and/or  MAJCOM  processes,  5)  implementation  of maintenance concepts and/or process improvements that directly/indirectly resulted in improvements to overall leading/lagging metrics. 3.1.1.6.  Winner  Notification/Presentation.    AF/A4  approves  the  winner  and  will  notify the  winning  MAJCOM  by  message.    AF/A4LM  will  coordinate  with  the  winning MAJCOM  A4  POC  to  ensure  the  award  is  ordered/mailed  to  the  appropriate  POC  for presentation.    Award  presentations  are  managed  by  the  MAJCOM,  not  by  nor coordinated through AF/A4LM. 20 AFI36-2818  23 JUNE 2017 Chapter 4 DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOR LOGISTICS, ENGINEERING & FORCE PROTECTION (AF/A4) AWARDS 4.1.

Automotive Services Excellence Service Professionals Award Fact Sheet. Purpose:  To honor ASE-Certified automotive technicians by recognizing their outstanding performance.  History:  ASE has been hosting annual technician awards for over 20 years.  The awards festivities are held in conjunction with the November ASE Board meetings at different locations throughout the United States.  Currently, we have 24 companies sponsoring 38 awards.  Some of the award sponsors are: Toyota/Lexus, Honda/Acura, Ford, GM, Chrysler, Nissan/Infiniti, Freightliner, International Truck & Engine, Midas, Snap-on, CARQUEST, Bridgestone/Firestone, DuPont and Delco Remy…just to name a few.  Awards are given in the automotive, truck, collision and parts categories.   What is the procedure?  The sponsor and ASE define the parameters for a specific award.  Once the parameters are established, ASE runs a query selecting the top 20 ASE test performers for the given time period based on the set criteria.  A winner is selected from that list.  ASE makes all logistical arrangements (travel and hotel).  Sponsors provide round-trip airfare and a two-night’s stay at the hotel where the awards events and ASE Board meetings will be held.  The sponsors can either provide their own, unique recognition award trophy, or simply use one supplied by ASE.  Who attends the awards ceremony? Attending are representatives from the sponsor companies, award winners and their guests (usually a spouse), ASE Board members, invited industry guests and ASE staff members.  What happens at the awards? A welcome cocktail party is held the evening before the awards dinner for all meeting and award attendees.  The awards banquet is held the following night.  The winners are individually introduced and called up to the stage to receive their recognition awards.  A professional photographer and videographer record the awards ceremony (copies of which are given to the sponsors and award winners).  Who pays for the awards? The sponsor company pays for travel and hotel expenses, a recognition award, and provides a cash award of $750 to $1000.  The approximate cost (not including the cash award) to the sponsor for one award winner is $2000 to $2500.  ASE covers initial costs for all but the cash award and bills the sponsors after the awards events.   As the award’s host, ASE covers the cost of the welcome party, awards reception and banquet, photographers and videographer, winner gift bags and group meals. 50 AFI36-2818  23 JUNE 2017 SAMPLE AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES EXCELLENCE NOMINATION Attachment 5 Figure A5.1.
