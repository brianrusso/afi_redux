The Air Force demonstrates its full support of civil legal authorities by ensuring Air Force military andcivilian personnel and dependents do not use military assignments to avoid valid orders of civilian courts.This directive establishes policies for personnel who cooperated with legal civil authorities in enforcingcourt orders relating to military and civilian personnel and dependents. 2.  Requests by Federal authorities for members stationed within the United States will normally begranted when a warrant has been issued pursuant to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.Requests by state authorities for members located in that state will normally be granted when the stateproduces documents preferring charges. 2.1.  Military members will not be transferred from a base within one state to a base within anotherstate for purposes of making them amenable to prosecution by civil authorities. 3.  Members stationed outside the United States will be expeditiously returned to requesting authorities incases where the member is convicted or charged with a felony or other serious offense (punishable byconfinement for more than 1 year) or is sought in connection with unlawful or contemptuous taking of achild from the jurisdiction of a court or from the lawful custody of another, unless noncompliance islegally justified. 4.  Commanders ordinarily do not have authority to compel civilian compliance with court orders, but willstrongly encourage civilians associated with their organizations to comply with valid orders of Federaland state courts, to include the use of adverse administrative actions against civilian employees, and with-holding of official sponsorship, where appropriate. 5.  A member subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) may be placed under restraint bymilitary authorities pending delivery to state or Federal authorities. Restraint may be imposed uponreceipt of information establishing probable cause that the member committed the offense, and upon rea-sonable belief that the restraint is necessary.
