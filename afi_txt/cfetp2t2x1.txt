This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty. The CFETP provides personnel a clear career path to success and covers all aspects of career field training. Note: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support their duty position qualification training.   2.   The CFETP consists of two parts. Supervisors plan, manage, and control training within the specialty using both parts of the plan.   2.1.  Part  I  provides  information  necessary  for  overall  management  of  the  specialty.  Section  A  explains  how everyone will use the plan. Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path. Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education,  experience,  training,  and  other).  Section  D  indicates  resource  constraints  (i.e.  funds,  manpower, equipment, facilities). Section E identifies transition training plans for the 2T2X1 career field.   2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime  tasks,  core  tasks,  and  correspondence  course  requirements;  Section  B,  the  Course  Objective  List,  is currently  reserved.  Section  C  identifies  available  training  materials  such  as  HQ  AMC  Qualification  Training Packages (QTPs) which were developed to support upgrade and proficiency training. These packages are located on the following website:  https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/AFP40/d/s6925EC1353610FB5E044080020E329A9/Files/a4t/a4tr/atsev/qtp/hello.html; Section D has a training course index supervisors can refer to for available support training. This area lists both mandatory and optional courses; Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional qualification training.   3. Using this CFETP as a guide will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career. This plan enables us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.               4    ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED Advanced  Distributed  Learning  System  (ADLS).

Section A - General Information  1.  Purpose. This CFETP provides information necessary for the AFCFM, MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program. This plan outlines the training that individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and  progress  throughout  their  career.  This  plan  identifies  initial  skills,  upgrade,  qualification,  advanced,  and proficiency training. Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements,  and  correspondence  course  completion  requirements  for  award  of  the  3-,  5-,  7-,  9-skill  levels. Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job. Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected Airmen. The CFETP has several purposes, to include:  1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field-training program. Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career.   1.2. Identifies task and subject knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.   1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method.  1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training process.   2. Uses. The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.   2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.   2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements. Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into the plan.   2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.   3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approving official and waiver authority for any changes to, and deviations from, this CFETP. The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.  8  Section B - Career Progression and Information  1. Specialty Description. 1.1.

This area is reserved.”  Part II  Section A - Specialty Training Standard (STS)  1.  Implementation.  This  STS  will  be  used  for  technical  training  provided  by  AETC  for  Air  Transportation Apprentice classes beginning 28 April 2016 graduating 08 June 2016.  2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201 and this STS:  2.1. Column 1 lists the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airman to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level of the Air Transportation ladder of the Transportation Career Field. During times when asked to accelerate to wartime surge, apprentice course will be taught 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.  2.2. Column 2 identifies Core Tasks using an “*”. The * is placed in the column corresponding to the 3-, 5-, or 7-skill level to identify specialty-wide training requirements for that level. These tasks and knowledge items are based on  an  analysis  of  the  duties  and  responsibilities  contained  in  the  Air  Force  Enlisted  Classification  Directory (AFECD),  The  Official  Guide  to  the  Air  Force  Enlisted  Classification  Codes.  Core  Task  STS  line  items  are mandatory and must be completed before the 5- or 7-skill level can be awarded.  2.3. Column 3 provides space for certification of OJT and is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements. If available, supervisors and trainers should use the automated training management systems to document technician qualifications. Task certification must show a start and completion date and include both trainer and trainee initials. Note: There are currently no tasks in the Air Transportation career field requiring third party certification.  2.4. Column 4 identifies the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the formal AETC school graduate as a result of training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course. See unit training manager for current CDC list.  2.5. Attachment 1 shows the qualitative requirements and the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.  2.6. The STS becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when automated or placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record. Document and certify completion of training IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program. Tasks are trained and qualified to the “go/no go” level. “Go” means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures.  2.7. The  STS is a  guide for  development  of  promotion  tests  used in  the Weighted  Airman  Promotion  System (WAPS). The Specialty Knowledge Test (SKT) is developed at the HQ AETC Airman Advancement Division by SNCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The test samples knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog (EPRRC). Individual responsibilities are in chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System. WAPS is not applicable to the Air Force Reserves and Air National Guard.  2.8. 2T2 AFCFM Policy Exception: When core task(s) training or capability does not exist on the local installation, the core task(s) will be annotated as “no training capability exists on local installation” and filed in the trainee’s OJT record or automated system. After coordination with the MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM), the unit will maintain a letter listing applicable STS core task(s), signed by the unit commander, certifying no capability exists 16  on local installation. The letter will include the specific core task(s) and the STS line item reference(s). The unit commander’s  letter  will  be  updated  bi-annually  and  forwarded  to  the  MFM.  When  a  new  unit  commander  is assigned, the work center supervisor will file an updated commander certified letter within 120 days of the new commander’s appointment.  3. Additional Requirements: MAJCOMs will use QTPs to train to their utmost capability based on available equipment or tasks performed at a specific location. Partial use of QTP training steps is authorized if not all required resources exist locally. It is not necessary to send people to off-station training to meet requirements created by QTP compliance.  4. Recommendations:  4.1. Unit Training. Managers, superintendents, and supervisors will ensure personnel are trained on all applicable STS items.  4.2. Graduate Performance.
