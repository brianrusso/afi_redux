RELEASABILITY:  There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.    OPR:  HQ USAF/A3OS  Supersedes:  AFPD11-5, 17 August 2009  Certified by: AF/A3  (Lt Gen John W. Raymond) Pages: 7  This  directive  provides  the  policy  to  ensure  safe  and  successful  Air  Force  Small  Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS) operations.  This directive applies to all Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG) units.  Air Force SUAS operations encompass  worldwide  missions,  day  and  night.    For  daily  operations  and  times  of  crises appropriate  air  crews  require  rules  and  procedures  to  support  safe  and  successful  Air  Force unmanned aircraft operations.  Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in  this  publication  are  maintained  in  accordance  with  (IAW)  Air  Force  Manual  (AFMAN) 33363,  Management  of  Records,  and  disposed  of  IAW  the  Air  Force  Records  Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Distribution Schedule (RDS).  The use of the name or mark  of  any  specific  manufacturer,  commercial  product,  commodity,  or  service  in  this publication  does  not  imply  endorsement  by  the  Air  Force.    Refer  recommended  changes  and questions  about  this  publication  to  the  Office  of  Primary  Responsibility  (OPR)  using  the  Air Force  (AF)  Form  847,  Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication;  route  AF  Forms  847  from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command. SUMMARY OF CHANGES This document has been substantially revised and must be thoroughly reviewed.  Major changes include  revision  of  the  publication  structure  for  Groups  2  and  3  Unmanned  Aircraft  Systems (UAS).    All  guidance  for  Group  1  UAS  is  consolidated  into  Air  Force  Instruction  (AFI)  11-5GP1-SUAS  Volumes  1-3  as  the  Group  1  Mission  Design  Series  (MDS)-specific  AFI.    Each Group 2 and 3 UAS will have an MDS-specific, Volumes 1, 2, and 3. 2 AFPD11-5  8 OCTOBER 2015 1.  Overview/Background.  The Department of Defense (DoD) categorized Unmanned Aircraft Systems  (UAS)  into  five  Groups  based  on  the  attributes  of  weight,  altitude  and  speed.    Small UAS (SUAS) are Groups 1, 2, and 3 UAS flown by trained, but not aeronautically rated, SUAS Operators (SUAS-O).  SUAS rules and procedures are closely aligned to those required of crews of  manned  aircraft.    The  similarities  include:  aerial  platforms;  disciplined,  professional operators/crews;  use  of  airspace;  requirement  for  aviation  maintenance/logistical  support;  and training.  Mission requirements, SUAS capabilities, airspace of intended operations, and assessed risks  are  all  factors  used  to  determine  specific  requirements  for  operator  training  and qualifications. 2.  Policy. 2.1.  The  Air  Force  will  establish  SUAS  training,  qualification,  and  operations  policy  and guidance in Air Force publications IAW current publications management guidance to meet global interoperability requirements for the full range of SUAS operations. 2.2.  The  Air  Force  shall  provide  policy  interpretation  and  oversight  from  the  Headquarters Air  Force  (HAF).    The  HAF  will  certify  and  approve  all  departmental  publications  that implement policy in this directive. 3.  Roles and Responsibilities: 3.1.  The  Air  Force  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  Operations  (AF/A3)  establishes  and  interprets SUAS policy and shall: 3.1.1.  Provide oversight for SUAS rules and procedures. 3.1.2.  Approve or delegate approval authority for AFI 11-502, (Volume 1, 2, and 3) and the corresponding MDS-specific AFIs. 3.2.  The  Air  Force  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  Operations,  Director  of  Future  Operations (AF/A35) establishes and manages policy for training, standardization/evaluation (stan/eval) and  general  operations  procedures  and  shall  be  the  approval  authority  for  the  lead  SUAS AFIs. 3.2.1.  AF/A3OS  is  the  OPR  for  AFI  11-502,  Volume  1,  Small  Unmanned  Aircraft Systems  Training, Systems and  Volume Standardization/Evaluation Program. Small  Unmanned  Aircraft 2, 3.2.2.  Air  Force  Flight  Standards  Agency  (AFFSA)/XOF  is  the  OPR  for  AFI  11-502, Volume 3, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operations. 3.3.  Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) is designated the lead command for SUAS and executes its responsibilities IAW Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-9, Lead Command Designation and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems. AFSOC shall: 3.3.1.  Coordinate with  all using commands to  establish guidance  for UAS Groups 1, 2, and 3. 3.3.2.  Consider  the  widely  varying  missions  when  developing  and  coordinating publications for each UAS Group. 3.3.3.  Designate and enforce use of a SUAS data management system.  Information shall be  used  to  manage  SUAS-O  qualifications,  training,  and  currency;  track  system AFPD11-5  8 OCTOBER 2015 3 availability  and  status;  and  conduct  trend  analysis.  EXCEPTION:  Air  Force  Materiel Command  (AFMC)/CC shall  incorporate  a  SUAS  information  management  system  into its own command-wide data manager. 3.3.4.  Modify  or  revise  vendor-provided  UAS  operator’s  manuals  and  checklists,  as required. 3.3.5.  AFMC/CC  is  responsible  to  develop  and  publish  training,  stan/eval,  and  general operations procedures unique to flight test operations.  AFMC units not conducting flight test  operations  will  conform  to  basic  and  MDS-specific  guidance  as  specified  in paragraph 3. 3.4.  All major commands (MAJCOM), field operating agencies (FOA), and direct reporting units (DRU),  and the Air Reserve Component shall comply  with  guidance published in  the applicable MDS-specific AFI. 4.  Publications Structure: 4.1.  The standardized AFI sets are a three-volume lead-AFI and additional three-volume sets of MDS-specific AFIs for each SUAS.  The three lead-AFIs provide guidance common to all three groups and shall be structured as follows: 4.1.1.  AFI  11-502,  Volume  1,  Small  Unmanned  Aircraft  Systems  Training.    This  is  the basic training guidance which creates standardized training programs for SUAS. 11-502,  Volume 2, Systems 4.1.2.  AFI Standardization/Evaluation  Program.    Establishes  the  stan/eval  program  that  supports Air Force objectives.  This instruction provides guidance on how to structure and monitor a stan/eval program. Small  Unmanned Aircraft 4.1.3.
