The  proactive  use  of  negotiations,  Alternative  Dispute  Resolution  (ADR),  and  other conflict  management  processes  can  quickly  and  effectively  resolve  controversies  in acquisition, environmental, international, real estate, tort, and other transactional areas.  It is Air Force policy to voluntarily use these processes to the maximum extent practicable, at the earliest stage feasible, and at the lowest appropriate organizational level. 1.2.  The skillful application of negotiation skills is the first step in managing conflicts and controversies.  The  Air  Force  Negotiation  Center  has  resources  applicable  and  available  at www.culture.af.mil/nce. 1.3.  When negotiations reach an impasse, ADR strategies must be considered and used to the maximum extent practicable.  For the purposes of this manual, ADR is a process agreed to by  the  parties  in  which  a  third-party  neutral  assists  in  the  resolution  of  an  issue  or  issues  in controversy. 1.4.  This  manual  complements  the  provisions  in  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation  (FAR) Subpart  33.  2,  Disputes  and  Appeals,  Defense  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation  Supplement, Appendix  A,  Addendum  II,  Alternative  Methods  of  Dispute  Resolution,  and  Air  Force  Federal Acquisition  Regulation  Supplement  (AFFARS)  Subpart  5333.2,  Disputes  and  Appeals.  These provisions provide a framework for the pursuit of ADR strategies, and are essential parts of Air Force ADR governance. 1.5.  This  manual  incorporates  by  reference  the  guidance  contained  in  the  Air  Force Alternative  Dispute  Resolution  Deskbook  for  Acquisition  Professionals  found  at www.  af.adr.mil.  The Deskbook provides guidance as to when a matter is suitable for ADR and on  how  to  conduct  ADR  when  it  is  pursued.    It  also  provides  a  template  Memorandum  of Understanding regarding the use of ADR which can be entered into between the Air Force and a given contractor at the commencement of an acquisition program or contract, and sample ADR template agreements which outline the conduct of ADR between parties to a contract dispute or issue in controversy. AFMAN51-1202  8 NOVEMBER 2016 3 Chapter 2 CRITICAL PLAYERS. 2.1.
