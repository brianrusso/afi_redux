Background.  EBS will be prepared when required to: 1.1.1.  Document  the  nature,  magnitude,  and  extent  of  any  environmental  conditions affecting real property. 1.1.2.  Identify potential environmental liabilities associated with a real property transaction. 1.1.3.  Satisfy environmental due diligence requirements. 1.1.4.  Develop information to assess health and safety risks. 1.1.5.  Protect human health and the environment. 1.1.6.  Determine possible effects of contamination on property valuation. 1.1.7.  Serve as the basis for notice of environmental condition when required under Section 120(h)(1) and 120(h)(3) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability  Act  of  1980  (CERCLA)  as  amended  (Title  42,  United  States  Code  [42  U.S.C.] sections  9620[h][l]  and  [3])  and  any  applicable  state  or  local  real  property  disclosure requirements. 1.2.  Concept. 1.2.1.  EBS  is  used  to  support  a  real  property  transaction.  These  real  property  transactions include AF acquisition of real  property (fee simple estate or by ingrant),  allowing others to temporarily use Air Force real property (outgrant), or disposal of Air Force real property. An EBS  is  also  used  to  satisfy  the  CERCLA  Section  120(h)(4)  requirement  to  identify uncontaminated  property  for  military  real  property  on  which  operations  are  closed  or realigned pursuant to a base closure law within specified statutory time limitations. 1.2.2.  A  properly  conducted  EBS  allows  the  real  property  transaction  authorities  to  make informed decisions on whether and to what extent such transactions should be pursued by the A.F.  and  under  what  restrictions  or  limitations  to  mitigate  the  U.S.  Government’s responsibilities and obligations for environmental conditions on the affected real property. 1.2.3.  For AF real property acquisitions, there is an expectation of strict adherence to those standards and requirements listed in 40 CFR. The preparer of the EBS should further expect rigorous review for compliance so that the AF can avoid, if possible, acquiring real property with  environmental conditions  that would not  fulfill  mission needs, would endanger health, or would create unforeseen environmental obligations and expenditures for the Air Force. 1.2.4.  In the rare event that an EBS was not prepared for a real estate transaction that is now being  renewed,  an  EBS  will  be  prepared  that  covers  the  preceding  term  of  the  real  estate transaction if possible. AFI32-7066  26 JANUARY 2015   5  Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Conducting an EBS.  In conducting an EBS of real property, follow applicable or relevant industry standards such as American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D6008. For real property transactions involving AF acquisition of real property, the EBS shall meet the EPA “All Appropriate  Inquiry”  requirements  at  40  CFR  312.  (T-0)  This  documentation  becomes  part  of the real  estate transaction administrative record.  An Environmental Professional  shall complete the EBS. An EBS is required for all new real estate acquisitions (in fee simple estate or ingrant), temporary  use  of  AF  real  property  (outgrant),  any  real  property  renewal  action  where  an  EBS was not previously accomplished, and real property disposal. An EBS should document existing and  past  environmental  conditions  of  the  property  and  be  prepared  by  an  environmental professional and professionals who are well qualified to assess the condition of cultural, natural, and biological resources. 3.2.  Programming and Funding. 3.2.1.  The  Environmental  Impact  Analysis  Process  (EIAP)  Manager  coordinates  with  the Real Property Office (RPO) or equivalents when the installation plans and programs for EBS requirements.  (T-2) 3.2.2.  Use  the  Automated  Civil  Engineering  System  -  Project  Management  (ACES-PM)  or other  approved  Air  Force  programming  information  technology  platform  to  program requirements for funding. 3.2.3.  The  proponent  will  be  responsible  for  all  costs,  whether  paid  in  advance  or  by reimbursement,  for  the  development  and  preparation  of  the  EBS  and  any  sampling requirements.  (T-1)  For  real  property  transactions  involving  an  AF  acquisition  of  real property  interests,  the  AF  normally  assumes  the  costs  of  preparing  an  EBS.  In  appropriate cases for other types of  real  property transactions  (e.g.:  requests by private parties), the AF may assume the cost of preparing EBS documents, but such costs must be justified in writing and  approved  by  the  AFCEC  Environmental  Directorate.  The  organization  and/or  non-AF proponent requesting the requirements may fund the project. 3.3.  EBS Waivers. 3.3.1.  The  BCE  or  authorized  designee,  in  consultation  with  the  base  or  AFCEC  real property  staff  may  waive  an  EBS  requirement  under  the  provisions  of  this  section  for  real property  transactions  involving  non-BRAC  property.  An  AFCEC  designee  shall  have  EBS waiver  authority  for  real  property  transactions  involving  BRAC  property.  An  EBS  waiver must  be  in  writing  and  document  why  the  transaction  qualifies  for  an  EBS  waiver.  The written EBS waiver becomes part of the real estate transaction administrative record. (T-1) 3.3.2.  Unless  statutorily  precluded,  an  EBS  waiver  is  possible  when  an  initial  records review,  interviews,  and  site  inspections  indicate  there  are  no  potential  sources,  releases,  or disposal of environmental contamination on the property and if examination of the proposed use of the property indicates that all the following criteria are met:   8  AFI32-7066  26 JANUARY 2015 3.3.2.1.  The  condition  of  the  property  will  not  create  unacceptable  human  health  and safety  risks  from  usage  of  the  property  allowed  under  the  real  property  transaction documents. 3.3.2.2.  The allowable use of the property will not introduce any hazardous substances or petroleum products in quantities greater than the minimum levels. 3.3.2.3.  The  allowable  use  of  the  property  is  consistent  with  environmental  compliance requirements (such as those pertaining to wetlands, historic preservation, etc.). 3.3.3.  Examples  of  transactions  that  may  be  eligible  for  an  EBS  waiver  from  the  EBS requirement include, but are not limited to: 3.3.3.1.  Renewing a temporary interest in real property if no change in the premises or in allowable use will occur. 3.3.3.2.  Leasing, licensing, or permitting of administrative space in an existing building having no known asbestos, lead or radon. 3.3.3.3.  Acquiring  restrictive  use  (e.g.,  development  rights  for  Explosive-Quantity Distance  arc,  clear  zone,  restrictive  use  easements  for  interests  acquired  under  10  USC 2684a, and navigation) easements and no other usage will occur. 3.3.3.4.  Issuing  temporary  rights  for  surveys,  inspections,  and  tests  where  there  will  be no introduction of hazardous substances or petroleum products on the property. 3.3.3.5.  Allowing non-exclusive use of AF property (e.g., easement for use of a road that is  also  used  by  other  base  vehicle  traffic  or  utility  privatization),  so  long  as  the appropriate disclosures of any potential threats to human health and safety are provided. 3.3.3.5.1.  The  NGB  may  coordinate  with  AFCEC  and  will  advocate  to  SAF/IEE when  applications  of  Joint  Reserve  Component  Use  as  encouraged  by  Title  10, Chapter 1803 are applicable. 3.4.  All Appropriate Inquiries. 3.4.1.  Per  40  CFR  312.20  “All  appropriate  inquiries”  pursuant  to  CERCLA  section 101(35)(B) must be conducted within one year prior to the date of acquisition of the subject property and must include: (T-0) 3.4.1.1.

See Attachment 2 for the report format. Specify any media, contaminants, or issues listed in the format that do not apply to the transaction. (T-0) 3.5.3.  Conclusions. 3.5.3.1.  Based on the findings, the EBS report shall categorize the presence of hazardous substances or petroleum products or their derivatives for each property or area, using the environmental  condition  categories  described  below.  Categories  shall  be  assigned,  as applicable,  to  defined  or  identified  areas  within  the  property,  so  the  real  property   12  AFI32-7066  26 JANUARY 2015 transaction  documents  can  disclose  or  warn,  with  specificity,  which  portions  of  the property fall under the relevant categories: 3.5.3.1.1.  Category 1: An area or real property where no storage, release, or disposal of hazardous substances or petroleum products or their derivatives has occurred into the  environment  or  structures  or  disposed  on  the  subject  property  (including  no migration of these substances from adjacent properties). 3.5.3.1.2.  Category 2: An area or real property where only the release or disposal of petroleum products or their derivatives has occurred. 3.5.3.1.3.  Category 3: An area or real property where release, disposal, or migration or  some  combination  thereof,  of  hazardous  substances  has  occurred,  but  at concentrations that do not require a removal or remedial action. 3.5.3.1.4.  Category 4: An area or real property where release, disposal, or migration, or some combination thereof, of hazardous substances has occurred, and all remedial actions necessary to protect human health and the environmental have been taken. 3.5.3.1.5.  Category 5: An area or real property where release, disposal, or migration, or  some  combination  thereof,  of  hazardous  substances  has  occurred  and  removal  or remedial  actions  or  both,  are  under  way,  but  all  required  actions  have  not  yet  been taken. 3.5.3.1.6.  Category 6: An area or real property where release, disposal, or migration or  some  combination  thereof,  of  hazardous  substances  has  occurred,  but  required response actions have not yet been initiated. 3.5.3.1.7.  Category  7:  An  area  or  real  property  that  is  unevaluated  or  requires additional evaluation. 3.5.4.  Requirements  Related  to  Hazardous  Substances  and  Petroleum  Products  and  their Derivatives. 3.5.4.1.  Make  the  following  types  of  recommendations  in  the  EBS  report  based  on  the conclusions  related  to  the  presence  of  hazardous  substances  or  petroleum  products  or their derivatives. (T-1) 3.5.4.1.1.  Consult  with  AFCEC/CIB  and/or  AFCEC/CIT,  AFLOA/JACE-FSC  and SAF/GCN    prior  to  completing  an  EBS  for  a  real  property  transaction  involving Categories 5-7. (T-1) 3.5.4.1.2.  Proceed with any planned transaction if the real property falls in Categories 1-4. 3.5.4.1.3.  Do  not  proceed  with  any  planned  transaction  for  those  portions  of  the property  falling  Categories  5-7  without  having  obtained  legal  concurrence  from AFLOA/JACE-FSC and SAF/GCN.  (T-1) 3.5.4.1.4.  Properties  falling  in  Categories  5-7  will  eventually  require  further investigation  to  determine  the  type  and  extent  of  contamination,  study  to  identify additional  mitigation  or  land  use  restrictions  necessary  to  allow  certain  land  uses  in consultation  with  installation  ERP  and  applicable  regulatory  authorities  without AFI32-7066  26 JANUARY 2015   13  endangering  human  health  or  the  environment,  and  may  require  response  actions  to adequately address the release or threat of release of the characterized contamination. 3.5.4.1.5.  For deed transfers where the AF is the grantor of Categories 5-7 property due to releases or threats of release of CERCLA hazardous substances, the Air Force may  not  be  able  to  provide  the  deed  covenant  required  by  CERCLA  section 120(h)(3)(A)(ii)(I)  warranting  that  all  remedial  action  under  CERCLA  necessary  to protect human health and the environment has been taken before the disposal of the property by deed. (T-0) 3.5.4.1.6.  In such cases, the AF may have to pursue a deed transfer whereby the covenant is deferred (“covenant deferral”) under CERCLA section 120(h)(3)(C). (T-0) 3.5.4.1.6.1.  For  deed  transfers  involving  covenant  deferrals,  the  AF  must  first obtain the concurrence of the Governor of the State, and if it involves property on the National Priorities List, the Air Force must also obtain the concurrence of the EPA Administrator. 3.5.5.  Requirements Related to Other Substances. 3.5.5.1.  The report should: 3.5.5.1.1.  Advise that the presence of any lead  and copper in  drinking water, septic tanks,  military  munitions  sites,  asbestos-containing  materials,  PCBs,  radon,  lead-based paint or other environmental conditions that may affect human health should be disclosed to property recipients. (T-1) 3.5.5.1.2.  Identify any abatement or mitigation measures necessary to bring property within  established  action  levels  or  that  should  be  considered  for  implementation  to minimize  potential  threats  to  human  health  and  the  environment  that  may  arise  as  a result of the real property transaction.  (T-1) 3.5.5.1.3.  Incorporate any restrictive provisions based on compliance issues into the recommendations. (T-1) 3.5.6.  Other Factors Considered. 3.5.6.1.  In  addition  to  the  previously  discussed  environmental  conditions,  ensure  the EBS  identifies  any  other  environmental  factors  that  are  relevant  to  the  proposed  real property  transaction.    For  ingrants,  appropriately  qualified  professionals  may  be  needed to identify the following additional factors: 3.5.6.1.1.  Presence of Cultural Resources. 3.5.6.1.1.1.  Archaeological resources and potentials for buried resources. 3.5.6.1.1.2.  Historic structures, facilities, ruins, etc. 3.5.6.1.1.3.  Native  American/Alaskan  Native-sensitive  resources  or protections. treaty 3.5.6.1.1.4.  Consultations underway, completed, and/or required.   14  AFI32-7066  26 JANUARY 2015 3.5.6.1.1.5.  Programmatic  or  Memoranda  of  Agreement,  or  Memoranda  of Understanding. 3.5.6.1.1.6.  Preservation/mitigation covenants. 3.5.6.1.2.  Presence of Natural Resources. 3.5.6.1.2.1.  Sensitive  flora  and  fauna  (threatened  or  endangered)  and  associated habitat. 3.5.6.1.2.2.  Biological opinions/consultations. 3.5.6.1.2.3.  Wetlands  [Presidential  Executive  Order  (EO)  11990  and  40  CFR 230.3(t)]. 3.5.6.1.2.4.  Floodplains (EO 11988). 3.5.6.1.2.5.  Stormwater management/drainage. 3.5.6.1.3.  Property Conditions. 3.5.6.1.3.1.  Property  conditions  that  could  generate  mission  related  safety concerns. 3.5.6.1.4.  Installation Development Plan (IDP). 3.5.7.  Certifications. 3.5.7.1.  The EBS report must contain a certification signed by the preparer regarding the accuracy of the EBS. See attachment for sample certifications. Include a certification of PCB clearance for AF-controlled property. If the presence of hazardous substances is on the subject property, a certification regarding the presence of hazardous substances must be included. (T-0) 3.6.  Phase  II.  Conduct  this  phase  if  the  property  requires  further  evaluation.    Reference industry standards such as ASTM E1903 for more information. 3.6.1.  Objectives of Phase II: 3.6.1.1.  Assess  whether  there  has  been  release  of  hazardous  substances  within  the requirements of CERCLA. (T-0) 3.6.1.2.  Develop  further  information  of  the  presence  of  substances  on  properties  where such substances were not previously identified. 3.6.1.3.  Provide  information  relevant  to  identifying,  defining,  and  evaluating  property conditions  associated  with  target  analyses  that  may  pose  risk  to  human  health  or  the environment. 3.6.2.  Consistent  with  general  procedures  of  the  Air  Force  ERP,  conduct  additional investigation as appropriate, to include surface, subsurface, and aquifer sampling to identify: (T1) 3.6.2.1.  Contaminants or sources of contaminants in structures or soil. 3.6.2.2.  The presence of surface or ground water contamination. 3.6.2.3.  The type, concentration, and extent of the contamination. AFI32-7066  26 JANUARY 2015   15  3.6.3.  Prepare  an  Addendum  to  the  Phase  I  survey  report  containing  the  findings, conclusions, recommendations and certifications of the Phase II investigation. (T-1) 3.6.4.  Determine  whether  contaminated  property  should  be  included  under  the  ERP  or  is subject  to  an  existing  Federal  or  state  regulatory  agreement  for  the  property  itself  or  the installation. (T1) 3.6.5.  Procedures for Unremediated Property:  If the subject property contamination has not been  remediated,  take  the  following  additional  actions  before  proceeding  with  any acquisition, interagency transfer, outgrant, or disposal of such property: 3.6.5.1.  Ensure  qualified  professionals  evaluate  the  results  of  sampling,  investigations and other available data, including any site or remedial investigations, to determine if any health, occupational, or safety risks are associated with the intended use of the property. Explain in the EBS report that the presence of such contaminants must be disclosed in the transaction documents. Analyze or recommend restrictive provisions in the real property transaction to: (T-1) 3.6.5.1.1.  Mitigate the effects of contamination to reduce any environmental, health, occupational or safety risks associated with the use of property. (T-1) 3.6.5.1.2.  Prevent  interference  with  and  preserve  AF  access  for  environmental compliance or follow-on needed response actions. (T-1) 3.6.5.2.  Ensure  these  measures  are  included  as  part  of  the  recommendation  in  the  EBS report. (T-1) 3.6.6.  Termination or Expiration of Temporary Interests. 3.6.6.1.  At  the  termination  or  expiration  of  a  temporary  interest,  any  environmental changes shall be documented in a supplement to the EBS report, restatement of the EBS waiver,  or  redo  the  EBS  report  if  appropriate.  This  documentation  becomes  part  of  the real estate transaction administrative record. (T-1) 3.6.6.1.1.  In  documenting  the  environmental  changes,  review  these  additional documents where applicable: 3.6.6.1.1.1.  Federal or state audits or inspections conducted during the term of the temporary interest. 3.6.6.1.1.2.  Documents  submitted  by  the  holder  of  the  property  interest  to Federal, state, and local environmental regulatory agencies. 3.6.6.1.1.3.  Occupational, health, or safety incident reports involving the property filed during the term of the temporary interest. 3.6.6.1.2.  Document  all  hazardous  substances  used  or  stored  at  the  property  during the term of the temporary interest. (T-1) 3.6.6.1.3.  Document all hazardous waste generated on the property during the term of the temporary interest and its disposition. (T-1) 3.7.  Recertification.   3.7.1.  Recertification of an EBS is required when:   16  AFI32-7066  26 JANUARY 2015 3.7.1.1.  The initial EBS is older than 180 days, and 3.7.1.2.  The real property transaction has not been completed. 3.7.2.  To  recertify  an  EBS,  conduct  a  visual  site  inspection  (VSI),  review  AF  records,  and note any changes in environmental conditions from the latest EBS on the recertification page. See Attachment 3 for an example of an EBS Recertification page. 3.8.  Supplemental  Environmental  Baseline  Surveys:  A  Supplemental  Environmental Baseline Survey (SEBS) is used to update and/or add to an existing EBS. 3.8.1.  Outgrants and Disposals (Lease, Easement, License, Permit, or Disposal of Air Force Property to Other Entities). 3.8.1.1.  Unless  the  AF  is  aware  of  activities  that  may  have  significantly  affected  the environmental condition of the property, an EBS is valid for 180 days. If no changes to the  property  and  after  180  days,  an  AF  Environmental  Professional  must  conduct,  at  a minimum,  a  visual  site  inspection  (VSI)  of  the  property  and  adjoining  properties.  All VSIs will be documented, certified and attached to the original EBS. If there have been changes in environmental conditions, a SEBS is required, regardless of when the original EBS was prepared. 3.8.1.2.  If  the  original  EBS  was  completed  more  than  1  year  prior  to  the  date  of  the outgrant  or  disposal,  a  VSI,  interviews,  an  update  of  the  records  review,  and  other appropriate research should be performed and documented as a supplement to the original EBS. 3.8.1.3.  If  the  AF  Environmental  Professional  conducting  a  VSI  or  supplement  to  the original EBS has actual knowledge that the information being used from the prior EBS is not accurate or if it is obvious, based on other information obtained by means of the EBS or  known  to  the  person  conducting  the  EBS,  that  the  information  being  used  is  not accurate, such information from the prior EBS may not be used. 3.8.2.  Acquisition of Property.  For a proposed acquisition (in fee simple or by ingrant) of property by the AF, prepare an SEBS for any prior EBS conducted more than 180 days prior to  the  AF  acquisition  of  real  property  from  another  entity  per  40  CFR  §312.20.  The  SEBS may be as minimal as a documented VSI and updated government records check conducted by an AF Environmental Professional, if the VSI and records check indicate no change in the environmental  condition  of  the  property  and  the  original  EBS  was  accomplished  within  a year  of  the  date  of  the  planned  acquisition.    If  the  original  EBS  for  an  acquisition  of  real property was accomplished more than a year prior to the date of the planned acquisition, then the supplemental EBS must include a VSI of the property and adjoining properties; updated search of relevant  environmental  regulatory or  government  records;  and updated interviews of current occupants, owners, and operators. Ensure the requirements for an “All Appropriate Inquiry”, as described in EPA regulations at 40 CFR 312, are satisfied. (T-0) 3.8.3.  To conduct  an SEBS, follow the same guidelines as Phase I and reference the initial EBS. 3.8.4.  Other examples of when to conduct an SEBS include: 3.8.4.1.  Additional buildings and or property that was not initially evaluated need to be evaluated to be a part of an initial larger scale EBS. AFI32-7066  26 JANUARY 2015   17  3.8.4.2.  Increased real property footprint to be included in the ingrant. 3.8.4.3.  Change in nature of use of property or buildings. 3.8.4.4.  Additional  environmental  work  (i.e.  INRMP,  ICRMP,  Biological  Assessment, etc.) completed since EBS was prepared. 3.8.4.5.  Additional facilities or property acquired after initial base-wide EBS needs to be evaluated. 3.9.  Signature Authority. 3.9.1.  The completed EBS shall be approved and signed by the Base Civil Engineer (BCE) or  authorized  designee.  (T-1)    However,  prior  to  approving  the  EBS  for  properties  with Categories  5-7  (explained  in  Section  3.5.3)  the  BCE  or  authorized  designee  must  consult with  Air  Force  Legal  Operations  Agency  Environmental  Law  and  Litigation  Division Environmental  Law  Field  Support  Center  (AFLOA/JACE-FSC)  and  the  Deputy  General Counsel  of  the  Air  Force  for  Installations,  Energy  and  Environment  (SAF/GCN).    For  an EBS  on  real  property  that  will  be  transferred  under  the  Air  Force  Base  Closure  and Realignment (BRAC), the AFCEC may designate the appropriate approval authority. 3.9.2.  The  EBS  must  be  prepared,  certified  and  signed  by  an  Environmental  Professional. (T-1) 3.9.3.  Any  recertification  of  the  EBS  shall  be  similarly  certified  by  the  Environmental Professional. The approval authority shall reside with the BCE or authorized designee. (T-1) Properties  that  deal  with  Categories  5-7  (as  explained  in  Section  3.5.3)  require  the  BCE  or authorized designee to consult with AFLOA/JACE-FSC and SAF/GCN.  JUDITH A.

An acquisition may be a temporary or permanent, exclusive or non-exclusive, interest in real property. Methods of  real  property  acquisition  includes,  but  are  not  limited  to,  purchase,  gift,  exchange,  lease, license,  easement,  interagency  transfers  of  real  property  accountability,  or  permits  to  use  real property from other Federal government agencies, revestment, recapture, or condemnation.   20  AFI32-7066  26 JANUARY 2015 Adjacent Properties—Not only those properties contiguous to the boundaries of the installation or  subject  property,  but  also  those  properties  relatively  nearby  that  could  pose  significant environmental impact or concern on the installation or subject property. Data Gap—A lack or inability to obtain information required by this practice despite good faith efforts by the Environmental Professional to gather such information. Disposal—Any  authorized  method  of  permanently  divesting  the  Air  Force  of  control  of  and responsibility  for  real  property.  Includes  fee  conveyance  and  interagency  transfers  or  other disposition. Disposal by Deed—A conveyance of fee interest in real property. Transfers of federal property by  deed  trigger  special  requirements  contained  in  CERCLA  120(h),  codified  at  42  U.S.C. 9620(h), to include notices, covenant warranties, response assurances, and reservation of access rights by the federal government to conduct subsequent responses if necessary. Although a grant of  an  easement  is  also  conveyed  by  deed,  it  does  not  trigger  the  special  requirements  in CERCLA 120(h). Environmental  Professional—A  person  who  possesses  sufficient  specific  education,  training, and experience necessary to exercise professional judgment to develop opinions and conclusions regarding  conditions  indicative  of  releases  or  threatened  releases  and  who  qualifies  under  the definition of “environmental professional” in 40 CFR 312.10. Hazardous Substance—In addition to the meaning provided in CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9601(14), this  term  shall,  for  the  purpose  of  this  instruction,  include  petroleum,  petroleum  products,  oil, natural  gas  and  lubricants  (POL).  It  does  not  include  POL  for  purposes  of  discussing  the  deed covenant in CERCLA section 120(h)(3). Interagency  Transfer—Transfer  of  Federal  government  property  accountability  to  or  from other Federal government agencies. Ingrant—Documents  (such  as  licenses,  leases,  permits,  easements,  foreign  base  rights agreements, and treaties) that give the AF an interest in or control of real property in less-than-fee ownership. Outgrant—Documents such as leases, licenses, easements, and permits that transfer interest in or control of real property from the AF to another Government agency, a non-Federal entity, or a private party. Present  or  Presence—With  regard  to  target  analytes  in  environmental  media,  present  or presence refers to the existence of the target analyte at the property and to places where the target analyte is located. Presence does not imply that the total extent of the target analyte is known. Proponent—Organization or entity that has a requirement that is driving a need for an interest in real property (either ingrant or outgrant). Storage—The  holding  of  hazardous  substances  for  a  temporary  period  prior  to  the  hazardous substances being either used, treated, transported, or disposed of. Temporary Interest—A grant of interest in or use of real property which expires at the end of a stated term or which can be terminated. Instruments include leases, licenses and permits. Real Property—Land and fixtures and other improvements affixed thereto. AFI32-7066  26 JANUARY 2015   21  Release—any  spilling,  leaking,  pumping,  pouring,  emitting,  emptying,  discharging,  injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing into the environment  (including the abandonment or discarding  of  barrels,  containers,  and  other  closed  receptacles)  of  any  hazardous  chemical, extremely hazardous substance, or CERCLA hazardous substance.    22  AFI32-7066  26 JANUARY 2015 Attachment 2 MANDATORY FORMAT FOR AN EBS REPORT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY E.1 Property Identification (address, assessor parcel number [if applicable], description) E-2 Site History and Operations E-3   Proposed Future Use E-4 Factors Evaluated  E-5 Property Categorization E-6 Findings and Recommendations SECTION 1.0 PURPOSE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE SURVEY   1.1 Introduction 1.2   Boundaries of the Property and Survey Area (include map)   SECTION 2.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY 2.1 Approach and Rationale  2.2 Description of Documents Reviewed 2.3 Property Inspections/Personal Interviews 2.4 Sampling SECTION 3.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION  3.1 History and Current Use   3.1.1   Historic  3.1.1.1   Historic Operations and Land Use 3.1.1.2   Demolitions  3.1.2   Current Operations and Land Use 3.2 Environmental Setting  3.2.1   Climate AFI32-7066  26 JANUARY 2015   23     3.2.2   Soils 3.2.3   Geology/Hydrogeology 3.2.4  Topography SECTION 4.0 PROPERTY CATEGORIZATION SECTION 5.0 FINDINGS FOR SUBJECT PROPERTY  5.1 Visual Site Inspection (VSI) 5.2 Hazardous Substances Notification  5.2.1  Storage of Hazardous Substances 5.2.2  Hazardous Substances Released 5.2.3  Hazardous and Petroleum Waste 5.3 Petroleum Products and Derivatives 5.4  Environmental Restoration  5.4.1  Environmental Restoration Program (ERP) Sites 5.4.2  Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP) Sites 5.5   Areas of Concern (AOC) 5.6 Storage Tanks(s) 5.6.1  5Aboveground Storage Tanks 5.6.2  Underground Storage Tanks 5.6.3  Pipelines, Hydrant Fuelling, and Transfer Systems 5.7 Oil Water Separator(s) 5.8 Grease Trap(s) 5.9  Wash rack(s) 5.10  Waste Tank(s)  5.11  Pesticides 5.11  Military Munitions/Ordnance    24  AFI32-7066  26 JANUARY 2015 5.12  Medical or Bio-hazardous Waste 5.13  Radioactive Waste 5.14  Solid/Municipal Waste 5.15  Indoor Air Quality 5.16  Groundwater 5.17  Wastewater Treatment, Collection and Disposal/Discharge 5.17.1  Storm Water 5.17.2  Septic Tanks and Leach Fields 5.18  Drinking Water Quality  5.19  Utilities (Energy) 5.20  Asbestos  5.21  Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) 5.22  Radon 5.23  Lead-Based Paint 5.24  Cultural Resources 5.24.1  Prehistoric Resources 5.24.2  Historic Structures and Resources 5.24.3.
