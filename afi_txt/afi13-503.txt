Purpose.  This publication codifies the process to inform, facilitate and document Air Force decisions  with  regard to  operational  nuclear  certification  (initial  and  recertification), decertification, and restrictions of Air Force nuclear-capable units 2.  Roles and Responsibilities. 2.1.  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  (DCS),  Strategic  Deterrence  and  Nuclear  Integration  (AF/A10) will: 2.1.1.  Publish certification and restriction guidance for organizations and units. 2.1.2.  Support the Secretary of the Air Force, Inspector General (SAF/IG) in developing the  list  of  nuclear-capable  units  as  is  required  under  CJCSI  3263.05,  Nuclear  Weapons Technical Inspections. 2.1.3.

Conduct  a  Nuclear  Surety  Inspection  (NSI)  as  described  in  CJCSI  3263.05  and AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System, and use the results of those NSIs as a basis for operational certification, decertification, or recertification of nuclear-capable units. 2.2.2.  Certify  or  decertify  nuclear-capable  units  in  writing.  This  authority  to  certify, decertify  or  recertify  a  unit  applies  to  all  levels  within  the  command  and  cannot  be delegated.  The  commander  may  delegate  authority  to  place  and  remove  operational restrictions on units to the Wing Commander. 2.2.3.  Notify  AF/A10  of  all  decisions recertification and operational restrictions of a nuclear-capable unit. regarding  certification,  decertification, 2.2.4.

Develop  inspection  criteria  to  be  used  by  MAJCOM/IGs,  in  addition  to  required AF inspection criteria. 2.2.9.  Develop  Public  Affairs  guidance  in  coordination  with  AF/A10  and  the  Secretary of the Air Force, the Directorate of Public Affairs (SAF/PA) to address the public release of information related to nuclear certification, decertification and restrictions. 3.  Operational  Nuclear  Certification.  The operational certification of a unit is required prior to  deeming  a  unit  nuclear-capable.  A  unit  is  operationally  certified  when  the  Lead/Using Command  qualifies/certifies  the  unit’s  personnel  to  perform  mission-specific  nuclear  tasks  (i.e. maintenance, transport, etc.), certifies personnel in the Personnel Reliability Assurance Program (PRAP)  IAW  DoDM5210.42_AFMAN  13-501,  trains  them  in  nuclear  surety,  and  assigns  a “Ready”  rating  following  a  successful  INSI.  Additionally,  operational  certification  is  required prior to receiving a new or modified weapon/delivery system or following the decertification of a nuclear-capable unit.  3.1.  The  Lead/Using  command  will  determine  the  need  to  conduct  an  INSI  as  required  in AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program to establish a unit’s operational certification and readiness, employ a new or modified weapon system, conduct operations in new or modified maintenance and storage facilities, or resume  a nuclear mission. The  Lead/Using  command commander  will  make  the  ultimate  determination  in  coordination  with  their  respective MAJCOM  Safety  Office  and  the  Air  Force  Safety  Center/Weapons  Safety  Division (AFSEC/SEW).  The  MAJCOM/CC  will  document  the  decision  on  whether  an  INSI  is required. The signed memorandum will be distributed to the units affected and the recipients listed in Attachment 2. 3.1.1.  The  MAJCOM/CC,  through  the  designated  lead  staff  agency,  will  prepare  a training timeline and determine readiness of the unit to receive an INSI. 3.1.2.  Initial certification of a unit prior to accepting a new mission or weapons system will be based on an INSI assessing the unit’s nuclear mission proficiency. The assessment will consider applicable criteria specified in CJCSI 3263.05 and AFI 90-201. 3.1.3.  Assuming  all  other  criteria  are  met,  units  will  maintain  their  operational certification  until  notified  by  the  MAJCOM/CC.  Operational  certification  will  be continually assessed through NSI criteria specified in CJCSI 3263.05 and AFI 90-201. 4.  Decertification.  The  decertification  of  a  nuclear-capable  unit  removes  all  of  the  unit’s authorization  to  employ,  assemble,  maintain,  transport  or  store  war  reserve  (WR)  nuclear weapons, associated components and certified support equipment. 4.1.  Decertification may result from one or more of the following: 4.1.1.  Unsatisfactory results of a NSI conducted by the MAJCOM/IG. 4.1.2.  Accident(s)/incident(s)  that  directly  or  indirectly  affect  the  safety,  security, effectiveness and control of nuclear weapons 4.1.2.1.  If required, Command Post personnel will transmit an Air Force Operational Report (AF OPREP-3) IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting.  (T-0). 4.1.3.  The unit’s inability to comply with requirements in DoD Nuclear Weapons System Surety Standards and/or the appropriate AFI 91-11X Weapon System Safety Rule. 4 AFI13-503  24 JULY 2017 4.1.4.  Commander’s  assessment  results  in  lack  of  confidence  in  unit’s  operational capability. 4.2.  A  nuclear-capable  unit  must  be  decertified  if  it  does  not  receive  a  Nuclear  Weapons Technical Inspection (NWTI) within the time limits specified in CJCSI 3263.05. 4.3.  The  MAJCOM/CC  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the  safety  and  security  of  all  nuclear assets during the interim period between decertification and recertification and will develop and implement mitigation measures that ensure safe, secure and effective WR assets. 4.4.  The MAJCOM/CC will document decertification via memorandum (Attachment 4) and will include, as a minimum, the following: 4.4.1.  Unit decertified, specific reason(s), and any prohibited activities. 4.4.2.  Specific actions unit personnel  must  perform to  ensure the safety  and security of any assigned nuclear weapons. For example, allow the Security Forces Squadron (SFS) to continue providing required security measures, although the SFS’s parent wing has been decertified. 4.4.3.  Unambiguous  information  to  the  unit  commander  on  the  specific  reasons  for decertification. 4.4.4.  A MAJCOM-developed training plan (in coordination with the decertified unit) to correct  deficiencies  identified  in  the  decertification  memorandum.  The  plan  should include a projected timeline for completion. 4.4.5.  MAJCOM/CC direction to conduct a re-inspection and use the results as the basis for re-certifying a decertified nuclear-capable unit if desired. 4.4.6.  The decertification memorandum will be classified, properly marked and handled IAW  AFI  16-1404,  Air  Force  Information  Security  Program  and  sent  to  the  unit commander and the recipients in Attachment 2. 4.5.  Upon  resolution  of  the  issue(s)  that  resulted  in  decertification,  the  MAJCOM/CC  will document  recertification  using  the  memorandum  in  Attachment  5.  Distribute  memorandum to the unit commander and the recipients in Attachment 2. 5.  Operational  restrictions.  Operational  restrictions  remove  the  unit’s  authority  to  perform specific  actions  directly  related  to  safe,  secure  and  reliable  operations  involving  nuclear weapons. They restrict specific actions, but do not decertify the nuclear-capable unit. 5.1.  Operational  restrictions  are  implemented  immediately  upon  notification  from  the MAJCOM/CC or the delegated authority. Either the MAJCOM/CC or the delegated authority will  document  the  specific  operational  restriction(s)  by  memorandum  (Attachment  5)  and distribute to the unit commander and the recipients in Attachment 2. 5.2.  The  restricted  unit,  in  coordination  with  MAJCOM  functional  staff,  will  develop  a corrective plan to address deficiencies identified in the operational restriction memorandum. 5.3.  The MAJCOM functional staff will develop criteria, training, and methods required for the unit to resume unrestricted operations. 5.4.  Operational restriction(s) are removed when the unit is notified by the MAJCOM/CC or delegated  authority.  MAJCOM  Safety  Office  will  document  removal  of  operational AFI13-503  24 JULY 2017 5 restrictions  by  memorandum  (Attachment  6)  and  distribute  to  the  unit  commander  and  the recipients in Attachment 2.
