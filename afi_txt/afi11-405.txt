Background  of  Pilot-Physician  Program.  The  Pilot-Physician  Program  (PPP)  provides integrated  operational  and  aerospace  medicine  subject  matter  expertise  (SME)  to  line  and medical  commanders,  and  provides  Human  Systems  Integration  SME  to  MAJCOMs  and acquisition  centers.  Pilot-physicians  are  involved  in  the  research,  development,  testing,  and evaluation of new and current Air Force systems and missions as early as possible to realize the greatest  effectiveness  and  cost  savings.    Because  of  unique  medical  and  human  factors qualifications, pilot-physicians are particularly well-suited to help develop requirements for new aircraft, life support equipment, and avionics or software upgrades, and to ensure that changing missions can be accommodated by crews and aircraft.  With Human Systems  Integration (HSI) training,  pilot-physicians  identify  and  prevent  human  performance  and  man-machine  interface problems  from  reaching  mature  operational  systems  and  perform  human  performance  gap analysis in fielded systems. 1.2.  Meeting  Objectives.  Pilot-physicians  meet  program  objectives competencies: through  four  core 1.2.1.

Conducting Analysis:  Pilot-physicians analyze and provide recommendations for: 1.2.4.1.  Aerospace  system  requirements  and  configuration  during  design,  development, production, testing, and operational use. the  operational  environment 1.2.4.2.  The  person,  mission,  and  machine (cockpit/ground control station/synthetic environment and mission integration, including life support equipment). in 1.2.4.3.  Mishaps as an investigative officer, medical member or safety consultant. 1.2.4.4.  Solutions for operational human performance problems. 1.2.4.5.  Solutions  for  problems  arising  between  the  operator  and  the  medical  service organization. 1.3.  Pilot-Physician Program Organization:  As depicted in Figure 1.1 of this instruction, the PPP  is  an  amalgam  of  permanent  and  Special  Position  Authority  (SPA)  Air  Force  Medical Service  (AFMS)  and  Line  of  the  Air  Force  (LAF)  manning  positions,  funded  by  both  Defense Health  Program  (DHP)  and  LAF  allocations.    The  Program  Director  typically  serves  as  the Director,  711  Human  Performance  Wing  (HPW).    Deviation  from  this  arrangement  requires written  approval  by  the  AF/SG.    The  remaining  positions  are  strategically  placed  to  allow  PP surveillance  of  Human  Systems  Integration  (HSI),  Human  Performance  (HP),  operational capability  gap  and  other  issues  that  arise.    The  processes  for  assessing  PP  from  the  pilot  and flight surgeon sectors of the AF are outlined in Chapter 3 of this instruction. AFI11-405  23 DECEMBER 2014   7  1.4.  Pilot-Physician  Career  Progression  and  Management.  The  PPP  PD  will  maintain  a current and prioritized list of all identified pilot-physician requirements and assignments. 1.4.1.  Before  being  selected  as  a  pilot-physician,  each  applicant  to  the  program  must  meet the criteria established in paragraph 3.2 below. 1.4.2.  The  pilot-physician  career  is  inextricably  tied  to  human  performance.    Beginning tactically  with  squadron-level  operational  flying,  a  career  may  progress  to  RDT&E,  major acquisition  program  consultancy,  HSI,  international  personnel  exchange  programs,  and strategic  policy  and  guidance  at  HAF,  MAJCOM,  or  OSD  level.    Additionally,  pilot-physicians  may  compete  for  command  and  other  leadership  roles  in  both  the  Air  Force Medical Service (AFMS) and Line of the Air Force (LAF), based on local commander intent and recommendation.  Operational experience and human performance expertise is applied in squadron/medical group command and senior staff positions in support of the warfighter and results  in  development  of  operationally  insightful  policy,  human  performance  sustainment requirements,  and  operationally  relevant  aerospace  medicine  standards.    Lastly,  pilot-physicians  will  be  used  to  build  an  experienced  cadre  sustaining  aeromedical  expertise  in fifth generation weapons systems, particularly single place aircraft. Figure 1.1.

Previously  Approved  Pilot-Physicians  (PP).  Assignment  of  previously  approved  pilot-physicians will be managed IAW this section. 4.2.  Subsequent Assignments. 4.2.1.  Pilot-physicians  previously  selected  and  approved  IAW  Section  3.2  above  do  not require AF/A3 approval for subsequent assignments. 4.2.2.  The  PD  will  coordinate  subsequent  assignment  of  pilot-physicians  with  potential gaining organizations. 4.3.  MAJCOM  Assignment.  MAJCOM/A3 is the approval  authority  for previously approved experienced pilot- physicians offered by the PD to fill MAJCOM identified positions. 4.4.  AF  HQ  Assignment.  AF/A3O  is  the  approval  authority  for  previously  approved experienced  pilot-physicians  offered  by  the  PD  to  fill  Air  Force  headquarters  positions  (e.g., AFMSA, SAF/AQ, AF/A3O- AT, AF/SE, etc.) 4.5.

Officers  possessing  the  primary  AFSC  of  P48VX  can  be assigned  to  other  positions;  in  this  case  the  duty  AFSC  will  reflect  the  assigned  position  (e.g., 48A4, S11F3J, etc.).  Such assignment to other than a P48VX billet does not remove the pilot-physician from the PPP. 4.7.  Flying  Training  Dates.  AFPC  will  assign  a  transition  course  (TX)  or  basic  course  (B-course) training date commensurate with approval as listed in paragraphs 3.2.7, 3.2.8, and 3.2.9 above.  (T-2).   26  AFI11-405  23 DECEMBER 2014 Chapter 5 TERMINATION PROCEDURES 5.1.  Termination  Procedures.  This  chapter  discusses Terminating a Pilot-Physician. the  Reasons  and  Methods  for 5.2.  Terminating for Cause.  A pilot-physician may be terminated for any of these reasons: 5.2.1.  Flying Evaluation Board (FEB).   Any pilot-physician who is found to be an unskilled pilot by a FEB will be terminated. 5.2.2.  Faulty  Medical  Practice.    An  individual  who  loses  clinical  privileges  in  aerospace medicine or whose professional or personal behavior does not meet the standards of the Air Force  Medical  Service  also  loses  pilot-physician  status.    According  to  AFI  11-402,  the individual may be disqualified from aviation service. 5.2.3.  Voluntary  Removal.    A  pilot-physician  may  ask  to  resign  from  the  program  by sending a written request, endorsed by the individual’s commander, to the PD. 5.2.4.  Failure to Comply.  An individual may be terminated from the PPP if he/she fails to comply with this Instruction or to accomplish the training mandated in this Instruction unless waived. 5.3.  Removal Method.  The PD with AF/A3O-AT removes a pilot-physician by: 5.3.1.  Requesting  local  HARM  of  the  pilot-physician  to  rescind  aeronautical  orders  as  a P48VX. 5.3.2.  Requesting AFPC to remove the award of AFSC P48VX from the pilot-physician. 5.3.3.  Requesting AFPC to reassign the officer to work in a physician capacity only, unless the physician’s medical practice was substandard.  NOTE:  A pilot-physician terminated for substandard medical practice can be considered for appointment to the line of the Air Force, if the AF/SG and AF/A3 agree, or may be discharged from the Air Force by administrative or judicial means, if circumstances warrant. AFI11-405  23 DECEMBER 2014   27  Chapter 6 TRAINING AND UTILIZATION 6.1.  Training  and  Utilization.  This  section  outlines  training  programs  utilized  by  pilot-physicians. 6.1.1.  Much of the training will be required in order to fulfill pilot-physician duties while the remainder may be considered highly desirable. 6.1.2.  Pilot-physician backgrounds, abilities, and interests are highly variable and should be considered when allocating training slots and/or funds. 6.1.3.  This list should not be considered comprehensive in nature as a complete list would be cumbersome, require constant update, and too restrictive.  Rather, this section is intended as a guide in the maturation process of individuals in this career field. 6.1.4.  Funding for TDY training should be shared among the PPP, medical group, and unit of assignment. 6.2.  Initial Flying Training. 6.2.1.  AFPC  will  assure  that  all  selected  applicants  will  complete  a  transition  course  or  its equivalent in the assigned aircraft after completion of internship or residency and one year of flight surgeon duties.  (T-2). 6.2.2.  The  minimum  qualification  is  basic  mission  capable  (BMC)  or  comparable  for  the first operational tour as a pilot-physician, in order to gain competency as a dual rated officer. 6.2.3.  All  pilot-physicians,  when  returning  to  a  flying  assignment  in  an  aircraft  not previously  flown  following  medical  training  of  five  or  more  years,  will  be  afforded  the opportunity to upgrade and fly as a combat mission ready (CMR) crewmember for a period of at least one year after becoming CMR. 6.2.4.  Clinical  responsibilities  during  this  period  will  be  maintained  at  a  level  to  permit continued  medical  credentialing.    At  the  end  of  this  one-year  period,  the  operations  and medical  group  commanders  will  meet  with  the  PD  and  reach  a  consensus  on  how  best  to utilize the pilot-physician for the remainder of his/her tour. 6.3.  Advanced Flying Training. 6.3.1.  Pilot-physicians  should  be  allowed  to  continue  to  upgrade  in  the  assigned  aircraft along  with  his/her  contemporaries  based  on  squadron/wing  requirements  and  individual competency. 6.3.2.  Qualified  pilot-physicians  will  be  considered  for  age  and/or  time  in  service exceptions-to-policy  as  required  and  allowed  to  compete  as  fully  qualified  applicants  for advanced training. 6.4.  Test Pilot School. 6.4.1.  A  pilot-physician  qualified  as  a  Test  Pilot  directly  supports  the  PPP  objectives  and fulfills required competencies.   28  AFI11-405  23 DECEMBER 2014 6.4.2.  As dictated by PPP requirements, the PD will consult with the Air Force Test Center (AFTC), 711 HPW, AFPC, AFMC, SG and AF/A3 to select a highly qualified PP to compete for TPS. 6.4.3.  AF/A3  is  the  waiver  authority  for  PP  applicants  who  exceed  the  age  restriction  for attending TPS. 6.4.4.  Upon  graduation  from  TPS,  a  PP-Test  Pilot  may  serve  the  needs  of  the  Test  and Evaluation community, in coordination with the PD, without the restrictions of fulfilling the career progression typically required of Test Pilots. 6.5.  Continuation  Flying  Training.  In  general,  absences  from  the  cockpit  in  excess  of  three years following selection to the PPP are discouraged. The PD will facilitate return to flying status following non-flying assignments to ensure needed expertise is maintained.  Further, the PD will ensure a cadre of weapons systems specialists are allowed to remain qualified as subject matter experts until replacements can be utilized ensuring continuity of the program. 6.6.  Human  Performance  Training.  It  is  desirable  that  all  pilot-physicians  develop  and maintain  expertise  in  three  critical  areas:  mishap  prevention  and  investigation,  human performance  sustainment  and  enhancement,  and  human  systems  integration.    The  pilot- physician will be considered not qualified, unless waived by the PD, if mandatory training is not accomplished.  If not previously accomplished, mandatory training will be accomplished during the first assignment after transition qualification in the assigned weapon system. 6.6.1.  Mishap prevention and investigation: 6.6.1.1.  Mandatory  training:    Course  B3OZY48G3  003,  Aircraft  Mishap  Investigation and Prevention – USAF Medical Investigator Course (USAFSAM) or Course WCIP 05A, Aircraft Mishap Investigation (AFSA). 6.6.1.2.  Recommended:  Each pilot-physician candidate accomplish at least one mishap investigation following above mandatory training, and mishap investigation consultation will be an ongoing process. 6.6.2.  Human  performance  sustainment  and  enhancement:    Recommended:    Course B3OZY4XHPE  0A1A,  Human  Performance  Enhancement,  taught  at  USAFSAM,  Defense Acquisition  University  (DAU)  Course  CLM041  and  RQM110,  Core  Concepts  for Requirements  Management  and  AFIT  Course  REQ111,  Air  Force  Capability  Based Operational Requirements Course. 6.6.3.  Human systems integration: 6.6.3.1.  Mandatory  training:    AFIT  Course  SYS169,  Human  Systems  Integration  in Systems  Capabilities  Requirements  and  Course  SYS170,  Intermediate  Human  Systems Integration. 6.6.3.2.  Recommended:    Naval  Postgraduate  School  Course  1  (OA3411):    Introduction to  Human  Systems  Integration  Course  2  (OA3412):  Human  Systems  Integration  in  the Acquisition  Life  Cycle,  Course  3  (OA3413):  Human  Systems  Integration  Tools, Tradeoffs, and Processes, Course 4 (OA4414):  Human Systems Integration Case Studies and Applications. AFI11-405  23 DECEMBER 2014   29  for  most  of the found requirements 6.6.3.3.  The at https://etca.randolph.af.mil.    If  exact  requirements  for  entry  are  not  met,  pilot- physicians  will  be  allowed  to  attend  by  virtue  of  their  position,  training,  and  future potential contribution to mishap prevention and human-machine interface.  Although no maximum amount of training in this area is stipulated, it is assumed that courses will be attended based on interest, cost, and need. above  may  be 6.7.  Medical  Training.  Pilot-physicians  maintain  aerospace  medicine  clinical  credentials  and expertise.    They  are  expected  to  receive  specialized  and/or  recurrent  medical  training  (non-centrally funded events funded by the PPP), for example: 6.7.1.  Global Medicine, (Course B3OZY48X0 000). 6.7.2.  Team Aerospace Operational Solutions (TAOS). 6.7.3.  AsMA Annual Scientific Meeting. 6.7.4.  Hyperbaric Medicine. 6.7.5.  Introduction to Medical Intelligence. 6.7.6.  Medical  Effects  of http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/outreach/meir/meir.htm Ionizing  Radiation (MEIR)  Course (or  equivalent) 6.7.7.  Medical Management of Chemical Casualties Course.  https://ccc.apgea.army.mil/. 6.7.8.  Medicine/Family Practice Review Courses. 6.7.9.  Master of Public Health Degree Granting Programs. 6.8.  Graduate  Medical  Education  (GME).  Pilot-physicians  not  already  certified  by  an American  Medical  Specialty  Board  are  encouraged  to  complete  the  USAF  Residency  in Aerospace  Medicine,  preferably  after  their  first  or  second  operational  pilot-physician  tour.  Alternatives  to  this  include  residencies  in  Preventive  or  Occupational  Medicine,  Family Medicine,  Emergency  Medicine  or  a (e.g., ophthalmology).  The timing for GME must be carefully considered in order to maximize return on investment and minimize time spent out of the operational environment. residency  with  operational  application 6.9.  Professional  Military  Education  (PME).  PME  is  an  integral  requirement  for  the professional  military  officer.  Most  pilot-physicians  can  be  expected  to  occupy  positions  of command  at  some  point  in  their  career.    For  these  reasons,  pilot-physicians  will  complete intermediate  and/or  senior  military  education.    Those  interested  in  PME  in  residence  will  be allowed  to  compete  (with  appropriate  waivers  when  necessary)  for  resident  positions  in Squadron Officer School or Intermediate or Senior Developmental Education (IDE/SDE). 6.10.  Miscellaneous  Training.  Training  or  TDYs  in  support  of  the  PPP  will  normally  be funded by the PPP/PD.  Training or TDYs for supported line or medical organizations should be funded  by  the  respective  organizations  as  stated  in  paragraphs  2.10.2  and  2.10.3  of  this instruction.  Although it is impractical to list all courses that might be beneficial, the following courses  are  included  here  as  examples  that  serve  to  broaden  the  pilot-physician  overall knowledge base: 6.10.1.  Defense  Acquisition  University  (DAU)  ACQ  101,  Fundamentals  of  Systems Acquisition Management (requires DAU account).   30  AFI11-405  23 DECEMBER 2014 6.10.2.
