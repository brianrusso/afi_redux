Purpose.  This  instruction  establishes  the  evaluation  criteria  to  be  used  by  Stan  Eval Examiner (SEE) when conducting Qualification/Mission (QUAL/MSN), Instructor (INSTR), and SPOT  evaluations  IAW  Air  Force  Instruction  (AFI)  13-1  STAN/EVAL  Volume  2,  Ground Command  and  Control  Systems  Standardization/Evaluation  Program-Organization  and Administration.  Specific areas are prescribed to ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of operations personnel. 1.2.  Recommendations for Change.  Recommendations for changes are encouraged, and must focus on specific areas and standards of performance.  Forward recommend changes IAW AFI 33-360 through channels (Air Combat Command (ACC)/A3C, PACAF/A8X, or to AF/A3O-CS using  AF  Form  847,  Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication.    AF/A3O  is  the  approval authority for interim changes to this AFI. 1.3.  Supplements/Waivers. 1.3.1.  Supplements 1.3.1.1.  MAJCOMs  will  coordinate  their  supplement  to  this  instruction  with  ACC/A3C before publication and forward one copy to AF/A3O-CS after publication.  MAJCOM/A3s will  approve  MAJCOM  supplements.    Supplements  will  not  contain  procedures  that  are contrary to this instruction. 1.3.1.2.  Units  will  coordinate  their  supplement  with  the  next  higher  Group/Numbered Air  Force  (NAF),  as  applicable,  prior  to  MAJCOM  approval.    MAJCOM  OPRs (ACC/A3C, PACAF/A8X) will approve unit supplements.  Air National Guard (ANG) units  will  coordinate  their  supplement  to  their  NAF  with  Stan/Eval  oversight responsibility  and  NGB/A3Y  who  in-turn  will  forward  to  the  gaining  MAJCOM  for approval.  Units will forward a copy of their supplement to said higher headquarters after publication. 1.3.2.  Waivers 1.3.2.1.  Waiver  authority  for  requirements  of  this  volume  will  be  IAW  AFI-33-360.  Waiver requests must come from commanders (or civilian directors) of the affected unit seeking  relief  from  compliance  through  the  command  chain  up  to  the  appropriate  tier approval authority (i.e., Tier 0, 1, 2, 3) (or publications approval authority if non-tiered).  See AFI 33-360 for definition of Tier Ratings. Tier 3 waiver authorities for this AFI are as follows:  (1) AFNORTH/A3 for Eastern Air Defense Sector and Western Air Defense Sector; (2) 611 AOC/CC for 176 ADS; (3) 154 OG/CC for 169 ADS; (4) 607 AOC/CC for 621 ACS;  (5) 35 FW/CC for 610 ACF; and (6) 18 WG/CC for 623 ACF. 1.3.2.2.  Waiver requests may be sent via email or memorandum, and shall include the following: (T-2) 1.3.2.2.1.  Reference  and commander/director is requesting a waiver. text  of the  specific requirement for  which the   22  AFI13-1BCCV2  24 NOVEMBER 2014 1.3.2.2.2.  Rationale  for  the  waiver:  Explain  which  of  the  following  three  reasons IAW AFI 33-360, apply and describe why: 1.3.2.2.2.1.  The cost of compliance creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority task; 1.3.2.2.2.2.  The expected cost of compliance outweighs the benefit; 1.3.2.2.2.3.  Personnel  cannot  comply  with  the  requirement  due  to  a  lack  of resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower). 1.3.2.2.3.  Time period or circumstance for which the waiver is required. 1.3.2.2.4.  Risk  mitigation  measures  the  requesting  commander  implements  during the waiver period. 1.3.2.2.5.  Impact if waiver is disapproved. 1.3.2.2.6.  Approved  waivers  will  be  uploaded  into  the  unit's  Management  Internal Control  Toolset  (MICT)  for  inspection  activity  review  and  publication  OPR's situational awareness/filing (T-2). 1.3.2.3.  PACAF/A8X  and  NGB/A3Y  will  forward  a  copy  of  all  approved  waivers  for their units to ACC/A3C.  ACC/A3C will, in turn, forward a copy of all approved waivers for  their  units  to  PACAF/A8X,  NGB/A3Y,  and  AF/A3O-CS.    Units  will  forward  all approved waivers and report all deviations or exceptions without waiver, through their chain of command, to MAJCOM OPR (T-2). 1.3.2.4.  Duration of waivers may be approved for a period not to exceed the requested waiver  period  or  30  calendar  days  after  the  approving  commander’s  tour  length, whichever is shorter. 1.3.2.5.  File a copy of approved written waivers with this volume IAW AFI 33-360. 1.4.  Evaluation  Methods.  The  primary  methods  of  determining  the  examinee’s  level  of  job knowledge  and  proficiency  are  academic  testing  and  observation  of  job  performance.    The questioning  of  examinees  during  the  positional  portion  of  the  evaluation  should  be  limited  to items not determined by observation, but related to the scenarios being employed for evaluation. 1.5.  Evaluation Procedures.  Examiners conduct evaluations IAW this instruction.  Examiners administer  positional  evaluations  only  within  their  weapon  system/crew  specialty  and  only evaluate those mission/skill sets in which they maintain qualification (T-2). 1.5.1.  Senior  Director  (SD)  examiners  may  evaluate  Air  Weapons  Officers  (AWO)  and WDs; WD and AWO examiners can evaluate each other and can evaluate the control portion of the SD evaluation.  Senior Director Technicians (SDT) examiners may evaluate Weapons Director Technicians (WDT).  Air Surveillance Officer (ASO) examiners may evaluate Air Surveillance  Technicians  (AST)  (except  for  the  Tracking  Technician  (TT)  portion);    AST examiners  may  evaluate  ASOs  and  TTs;    Interface  Control  Officer  examiners  (ICO)  may evaluate Interface Control Technicians (ICT), ICT examiners may evaluate ICOs (T-3). 1.5.2.  Prior to Evaluation.  The SEE will explain the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be conducted (T-3).  The examinee will accomplish all mission planning appropriate for the type of evaluation (T-3). AFI13-1BCCV2  24 NOVEMBER 2014   23  1.5.3.  During  Evaluation.    The  SEE  will  evaluate  the  examinee's  performance  for  each graded  area  and  note  discrepancies  when  deviations  from  prescribed  performance  criteria occur during the evaluation (T-3). 1.5.4.  Post Evaluation.  The SEE compares the examinee's performance with the grading criteria and assigns an appropriate grade for each area.  The SEE considers cumulative momentary deviations.  The judgment of the SEE is the determining factor in assigning an  overall  grade  for  the  examinee's  performance.    The  SEE  thoroughly  critiques  all aspects of the evaluation.  During this critique, the SEE reviews the examinee's overall rating,  specific  deviations,  area  grades  assigned,  and  any  additional  training  which  the examinee is required to complete.  All initial qualification or initial instructor evaluations resulting in Exceptionally Qualified (EQ), Qualified 2 (Q2), or Qualified 3 (Q3) will be debriefed  with  the  examinee's  squadron  commander/operations  officer  (or  designated representative), and flight commander (or designated representative) (T-3). 1.5.5.  Academic  Examination.    The  academic  examination  is  the  master  question  file (MQF) written examination.  The academic examination will be administered IAW AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2.  For initial evaluations, academic examinations are completed prior to any positional portions of the evaluation unless waived by the unit commander on a case-by-case basis.  For requalification evaluations (RQ) and periodic evaluations the written examination is completed at the discretion of the Chief, Stan Eval. (T-2) 1.5.5.1.  The  written  examination  for  a  QUAL/MSN  evaluation  will  consist  of  70 questions from the MAJCOM MQF, 15 questions from the unit MSN MQF, and 15 questions from the Local Procedures Master Question File (LPMQF) (T-3). 1.5.5.2.  INIT MSN examinations may be waived by the unit commander (CC) if the evaluation was combined with the INIT QUAL evaluation (T-3). 1.6.  SEE  Objectivity  Evaluations.  SEE  Objectivity  Evaluations  will  be  given  IAW  AFI13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2, paragraph 5.2 after initial selection as a SEE and at the discretion and direction of the unit CC (ADS/DO) thereafter (T-3). 1.7.  Grading Policy.  Examiners will use the rating policies contained in AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2, paragraph 5.3 and the evaluation criteria in this instruction for conducting all positional evaluations.  Use of these criteria ensures standard and objective evaluations are administered to crew members.  SEEs and crew members will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed grading criteria in this regulation (T-2).  A three-level grading system (Q, Q-, or Unqualified (U)) will be used for all areas except those designated as CRITICAL, in which case a two-grading system (Q or U) will be used (T-2).  An overall rating of “Unqualified” could result from an unqualified rating of a single  critical or multiple noncritical areas. All area ratings  are based on the three level rating system (Q, Q-, and U) described in Paragraph  1.8.1 and the criteria listed in the individual chapters or areas. (T-2) 1.8.  Required  Evaluation  Areas.  Required  evaluation  areas  are  defined  as  all  areas  (and associated sub-areas) identified in this document.  See Attachment  2 for a listing of required evaluation  areas.    The  examiner  evaluates  the  examinee's  performance  in  all  required  areas.  When  a  required  area  cannot  be  evaluated  during  live  fly  operations  because  of  equipment malfunctions,  weather  conditions,  operational  requirements,  or  lack  of  adequate  operating airspace, the area may be graded using simulation or a verbal evaluation.  Examiners make every   24  AFI13-1BCCV2  24 NOVEMBER 2014 effort to evaluate all required areas during the live fly portion before resorting to this alternative.  If  an  alternate  evaluation  method  is  used,  the  Examiner  will  document  the  method  under  the Mission  Description  paragraph  in  the  Remarks  section  of  the  AF  Form  8,  Certification  of Aircrew Qualification, IAW AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL, Vol. 2 (T-2). 1.8.1.  Evaluation tasks are shown in the appropriate evaluation area, along with the rating scale  for  each  task.    Each  area/task  has  a  three-level  (Q/Q-/U)  grading  system  with  the exception  of  “CRITICAL”  areas.    The  overall  area  grade  will  reflect  the  majority  of  the ratings assessed for the examinee’s achievement of tasked sub-areas (T-3). 1.8.1.1.  Q.  A “Q” is the desired level of performance.  This  grade is given when the examinee demonstrates a satisfactory knowledge of all required information and performs mission duties within the prescribed tolerances and accomplishes the assigned mission. 1.8.1.2.  Q-.    A  “Q-“  indicates  the  examinee  is  qualified  to  perform  the  assigned  area tasks without supervision, but requires a written debriefed comment or additional training unless,  in  the  judgment  of  the  examiner,  it  would  not  constructively  improve  the examinee’s  performance.    Deviations  from  established  standards  must  not  exceed  the prescribed “Q-“ tolerances or jeopardize flight safety. 1.8.1.3.  U.  Assign a “U” area grade for any performance outside allowable parameters and  for  deviations  from  prescribed  procedures/tolerances  that  adversely  affect  mission accomplishment or compromise flight safety.  An examinee receiving an area grade of “U” requires additional training. 1.8.1.4.  Critical  Areas.    Critical  grading  areas  have  been  established  for  evaluations.  Critical  areas  are  defined  as  events  that  require  adequate  accomplishment  by  the examinee  in  order  to  successfully  achieve  the  mission  objectives  and  complete  the evaluation.  If an examinee receives a "U" grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will also be unqualified.  Critical areas are identified by  "(CRITICAL)" following the applicable area title. (T-3) 1.9.  Simulation Evaluations.  Simulation may be used to administer any portion of a positional evaluation  not  requiring  a  specific  live  scenario  (T-3).    Unit  SEEs  will  identify  existing simulation scenarios which include adequate activity to meet the evaluation requirements for the required events (T-3).  If adequate scenarios did not exist, unit Stan Eval personnel will develop scenario outlines for the simulation activity to be conducted to ensure standardization of both the level of activity and the difficulty for simulation evaluations (T-3).  The SEE’s judgment will be the determining factor in the effective use of simulation (T-3). AFI13-1BCCV2  24 NOVEMBER 2014   25  Chapter 2 INSTRUCTOR QUALIFICATION EVALUATION  2.1.  General 2.1.1.  This  chapter  contains  the  criteria  specifying  the  tasks  required  of  a  qualified Instructor.  All  crew  members  selected  for  instructor  duty  must  be  evaluated  to  determine their  judgment,  technical  knowledge,  instructor  ability  (including  error  analysis  of  student activity), and use of grading documents as well as proficiency in their duty position (T-3).  To  initially  qualify  as  an  instructor,  a  crew  member  must  successfully  complete  an  initial instructor  evaluation  (T-3).    Subsequent  periodic  evaluations  of  instructors  are  conducted during  the  recurring  evaluations  in  which  individuals  are  qualified  to  instruct  and  are included in the individual duty positions. 2.1.2.  Instructors who were certified prior to the publication of the instruction will maintain their certifications until expiration or at the discretion of the unit commander (T-3).  These instructors will then complete an instructor evaluation IAW AFI 13-1STAN/ EVAL Vol. 2 (T-3). 2.2.  Evaluation  Objective.  Instructors  must  demonstrate  proficiency  by  instructing  a  student (or qualified individual acting as a student) (T-3).  The examiner may require the examinee to present  verbal  explanations  of  equipment  operations,  procedures,  and  techniques  pertinent  to their crew position duties and responsibilities.

General 15.1.1.  This chapter contains the criteria specifying the tasks required of a BQ SD/ SDT and is applicable to 13BXX/1C5X1s assigned to the 610ACF and 623ACF.  Both the 610ACF and 623ACF will supplement this chapter to encompass those responsibilities required during TCOT operations in ACFOI 13-1 TCOT Crew Employment Standards (T-3). 15.1.2.  The SD/SDT evaluation must include performance during daily flying activity that supports evaluation objectives (T-3).  Scenarios for non-flying activities should be used to cover areas not normally encountered during daily activity.  The SD/SDT must supervise a minimum  of  two  control  teams  during  the  evaluation  (T-3).    Functional  tasks  common  to weapons and SD may be evaluated only once and credited to both evaluations. 15.1.3.  Functional tasks common to both WD/T and SD/T may be evaluated only once and credited  to  both  evaluations.    The  differences  between  the  SD  and  SDT  evaluations  are primarily  in  scope  of  responsibilities  and  the  expectation  that  the  SDT  completes  the requirements by assisting the SD. 15.2.  Evaluation  Objective.  The  examinee  must  demonstrate  the  ability  to  accomplish  all SD/SDT duties safely and effectively IAW technical orders and operational directives (T-3).  A rating of Q, Q- or U will be given to each non-critical area (T-2).  Critical areas are rated Q or U (T-2). Title Table 15.1.

Purpose.  This chapter, in conjunction with AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2, gives 621 Air Control  Squadron  (ACS)  assigned  SEE  procedures  and  criteria  to  use  during  MCC/MCCT evaluations.  Adherence to these procedures and criteria ensures an accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of crew members. 18.2.  Rating  Policies.  SEEs will use the rating policies in AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2 and this  chapter  for  conducting  all  evaluations  (T-2).    All  area  ratings  are  based  on  a  three  level rating system (Q, Q- and U) described below.  Critical grading area ratings are based on a two level rating system (Q/U) described below. the  prescribed tolerances  and  accomplishes 18.2.1.  A  Qualified  area  grade  (Q)  is  the  desired  level  of  performance.    The  examinee demonstrates a satisfactory level of knowledge of all required information, performed duties within the  assigned  mission  with  no discrepancies. 18.2.2.  A Qualified-minus area grade (Q-) indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned  area  tasks,  but  requires  a  written  debriefed  comment  or  additional  training  as determined  by  the  SEE.    Deviations  from  established  standards  must  not  exceed  the prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety (T-3). 18.2.3.  An  Unqualified  area  grade  (U)  is  given  for  performance  outside  allowable parameters  or  deviations jeopardized  mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety.  An examinee receiving an area grade of “U” normally requires additional training.  When, in the judgment of the SEE, additional training will not constructively improve examinee performance, it is not required, but the SEE will thoroughly debrief the examinee (T-3). from  prescribed  procedures that 18.3.  Evaluation  Methods.  The  primary  method  of  determining  an  examinee's  level  of knowledge and proficiency is observation of job performance on live missions.  When conditions such as mission availability preclude evaluation of a particular event on a live mission, it may be evaluated  by  an  alternate  method  (i.e.,  mission  simulator,  verbally  or  academic  ground evaluation scenario) if allowed in the evaluation requirements section of this chapter.  SEEs will make every effort to evaluate all required areas on a live mission before resorting to alternatives.  Document alternate evaluation methods for each area in the Mission Description section of the AF Form 8.  The questioning of examinees during the positional portion of the evaluation should be  limited  to  items  not  easily  determined  by  observation  and  related  to  the  scenario  being employed for the evaluation. (T-3) 18.4.  Critical  Areas.  Critical  grading  areas  are  defined  as  events  that  require  a  degree  of knowledge  and  proficiency  essential  for  safety  and  mission  accomplishment.    If  an  examinee receives  a  “U”  grade  in  any  critical  area,  the  overall  grade  for  the  evaluation  will  also  be unqualified (T-3).  Critical areas are identified by “(Critical)” following the applicable area title.   142  AFI13-1BCCV2  24 NOVEMBER 2014 18.5.  Evaluation Requirements.  All areas specified in this chapter are required for a complete positional evaluation (T-3). 18.5.1.  The  IQE/Requalification  Evaluation  (RQE)  positional  evaluation  will  demonstrate the  examinee’s  ability  to  operate  mission  systems  and  apply  local  theater  guidance  to effectively accomplish the mission (T-3). 18.5.1.1.  The examinee will complete a written examination derived from the MAJCOM Master Question File and unit derived Local Operating Procedures (T-3). 18.5.1.2.  The examinee will perform duties as the MCC/MCCT during live daily flying operations to support evaluation objectives (T-3).  The SEE will determine whether the extent of live flying activity is sufficient for evaluation purposes (T-3).  The evaluation may continue on a subsequent day to fully meet evaluation requirements.  Area 13, Daily Flying Operations, must be accomplished live (T-3).  Other areas may be accomplished by alternate methods. 18.5.2.  Upon  completion  of  Mission  Qualification  Training  (MQT),  Stan/Eval  will administer  a  25-question,  written  Mission  Qualification  Evaluation  (MQE)  (T-3).    The passing score is 85 percent.  Stan/Eval  will maintain at least two different tests on  file or utilize a computer-generated testing program (T-3).  A positional evaluation is not required upon completion of MQT. 18.5.3.  Upon  successful  completion  of  the  MQE,  give  individuals  CMR  status  and  place them into CT (T-3). 18.6.  Evaluation  Objective.  The  examinee  must  demonstrate  the  ability  to  accomplish  all MCC/MCCT duties safely and effectively IAW technical orders and operations directives (T-3).  A rating of Q, Q- or U will be given to each area (T-2).  Critical areas are rated Q or U (T-2). Title Table 18.1.

Purpose.  This chapter, in conjunction with AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2, gives 621 ACS assigned SEE procedures and criteria to use during WD, AWO, and SD evaluations.  Adherence to  these  procedures  and  criteria  ensures  an  accurate  assessment  of  the  proficiency  and capabilities of crew members. 19.2.  Rating  Policies.  SEEs will use the rating policies in AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2 and this  chapter  for  conducting  all  evaluations  (T-2).    All  non-critical  area  ratings  are  based  on  a three level rating system (Q, Q-, and U) described below.  Critical grading area ratings are based on a two level rating system (Q/U) described below. the  prescribed tolerances  and  accomplishes 19.2.1.  A  Qualified  area  grade  (Q)  is  the  desired  level  of  performance.    The  examinee demonstrates a satisfactory level of knowledge of all required information, performed duties within the  assigned  mission  with  no discrepancies. 19.2.2.  A Qualified-minus area grade (Q-) indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned  area  tasks,  but  requires  a  written  debriefed  comment  or  additional  training  as determined  by  the  SEE.    Deviations  from  established  standards  must  not  exceed  the prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety (T-3). 19.2.3.  An  Unqualified  area  grade  (U)  is  given  for  performance  outside  allowable parameters  or  deviations jeopardized  mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety.  An examinee receiving an area grade of “U” normally requires additional training.  When, in the judgment of the SEE, additional training will not constructively improve examinee performance, it is not required, but the SEE will thoroughly debrief the examinee (T-3). from  prescribed  procedures that 19.3.  Evaluation  Methods.  The  primary  method  of  determining  an  examinee's  level  of knowledge and proficiency is observation of job performance on live missions.  When conditions such as mission availability preclude evaluation of a particular event on a live mission, it may be evaluated  by  an  alternate  method  (i.e.,  mission  simulator,  verbally  or  academic  ground evaluation scenario) if allowed in the evaluation requirements section of this chapter.  SEEs will make every effort to evaluate all required areas on a live mission before resorting to alternatives.  Document alternate evaluation methods for each area in the Mission Description section of the AF Form 8.  The questioning of examinees during the positional portion of the evaluation should be  limited  to  items  not  easily  determined  by  observation  and  related  to  the  scenario  being employed for the evaluation. (T-3) 19.4.  Critical  Areas.  Critical  grading  areas  are  defined  as  events  that  require  a  degree  of knowledge  and  proficiency  essential  for  safety  and  mission  accomplishment.    If  an  examinee receives  a  “U”  grade  in  any  critical  area,  the  overall  grade  for  the  evaluation  will  also  be unqualified (T-3).  Critical areas are identified by “(Critical)” following the applicable area title. 19.5.  Evaluation Requirements.  All areas specified in this chapter are required for a complete positional evaluation (T-3).   148  AFI13-1BCCV2  24 NOVEMBER 2014 19.5.1.  The IQE/RQE positional evaluation tests an individual’s ability to operate equipment and integrate with the crew to accomplish a mission.  An “SD Upgrade IQE” is defined as an evaluation given to a 621 ACS CMR AWO or a previously qualified SD from another MDS (at  the  SQ/DOs  discretion),  who  has  completed  required  SD  training  through  Directorate Operations  Training  (DOT).    Positional  evaluations  for  upgrade  to  SD  will  include  all grading  areas  necessary  to  perform  the  supervisory  role  (T-3).    The  SD  evaluation  will include weapons control supervision, air-to-air, check-in and air-refueling criteria (T-3). 19.5.1.1.  The  examinee  will  complete  an  IQE  written  examination  derived  from  the PACAF MQF and unit derived Local Operating Procedures (T-3). 19.5.1.2.  The  examinee  will  perform  duties  as  the  WD/AWO  or  SD  during  live  daily flying  operations  to  support  evaluation  objectives  (T-3).    The  SEE  will  determine whether the extent of live flying activity is sufficient for evaluation purposes (T-3).  The evaluation  may  continue  on  a  subsequent  day  to  fully  meet  evaluation  requirements.  Area 19, Weapons Control Supervision (Critical) (SD Only), must be accomplished live (T-3). 19.5.1.3.  Evaluation  requirements  for  the  Air-to-Air  portion  of  the  qualification  are  to control a 2v2 or greater mission.  This must be a two-scope, two-frequency control event and must be accomplished live (T-3). 19.5.1.4.  Evaluation requirements for the Air Refueling portion of the qualification are to simultaneously  control  two  flights  of  receivers  and  the  tanker.    Examinee  must demonstrate the ability to tactical two flights of receivers and the tanker (T-3).  Examinee must demonstrate the ability to tactically control both tanker and receiver for an effective rendezvous (T-3).  Due to operational constraints, this portion is normally accomplished in the simulator. 19.5.1.5.  Evaluation  requirements  for  the  Check-In  portion  of  the  qualification  are  to control five flights from check-in to check-out.  This control event must be accomplished live (T-3). 19.5.2.  Upon completion of MQT, Stan/Eval will administer a 25-question, written MQE (T-3).  The passing score is 85 percent.  Stan/Eval will maintain at least two different tests on file  or  utilize  a  computer-generated  test  program  (T-3).    A  positional  evaluation  is  not required upon completion of MQT. 19.5.3.  Upon  successful  completion  of  the  MQE,  give  individuals  CMR  status  and  place them into CT (T-3). 19.6.  Evaluation  Objective.  The  examinee  must  demonstrate  the  ability  to  accomplish  all duties safely and effectively IAW technical orders and operations directives (T-3).  A rating of Q, Q- or U will be given to each area (T-2). Critical areas are rated Q or U (T-2). Table 19.1.

This chapter, in conjunction with AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2, gives 621 ACS assigned SEE procedures and criteria to use during Data System Technician (DST) evaluations.  Adherence to these procedures and criteria ensures an accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of crew members. 20.2.  Rating  Policies.  SEEs will use the rating policies in AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2 and this  chapter  for  conducting  all  evaluations  (T-2).    All  non-critical  area  ratings  are  based  on  a three level rating system (Q, Q-, and U) described below.  Critical grading area ratings are based on a two level rating system (Q/U) described below. the  prescribed tolerances  and  accomplishes 20.2.1.  A  Qualified  area  grade  (Q)  is  the  desired  level  of  performance.    The  examinee demonstrates a satisfactory level of knowledge of all required information, performed duties within the  assigned  mission  with  no discrepancies. 20.2.2.  A Qualified-minus area grade (Q-) indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned  area  tasks,  but  requires  a  written  debriefed  comment  or  additional  training  as determined  by  the  SEE.    Deviations  from  established  standards  must  not  exceed  the prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety (T-3). 20.2.3.  An  Unqualified  area  grade  (U)  is  given  for  performance  outside  allowable parameters  or  deviations jeopardized  mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety.  An examinee receiving an area grade of “U” normally requires additional training.  When, in the judgment of the SEE, additional training will not constructively improve examinee performance, it is not required, but the SEE will thoroughly debrief the examinee (T-3). from  prescribed  procedures that 20.3.  Evaluation  Methods.  The  primary  method  of  determining  an  examinee's  level  of knowledge and proficiency is observation of job performance on live missions.  When conditions such as mission availability preclude evaluation of a particular event on a live mission, it may be evaluated  by  an  alternate  method  (i.e.,  mission  simulator,  verbally  or  academic  ground evaluation scenario) if allowed in the evaluation requirements section of this chapter.  SEEs will make every effort to evaluate all required areas on a live mission before resorting to alternatives. Document alternate evaluation methods for each area in the Mission Description section of the AF Form 8.  The questioning of examinees during the positional portion of the evaluation should be  limited  to  items  not  easily  determined  by  observation  and  related  to  the  scenario  being employed for the evaluation. (T-3) 20.4.  Critical  Areas.  Critical  grading  areas  are  defined  as  events  that  require  a  degree  of knowledge  and  proficiency  essential  for  safety  and  mission  accomplishment.    If  an  examinee receives  a  “U”  grade  in  any  critical  area,  the  overall  grade  for  the  evaluation  will  also  be unqualified (T-3).  Critical areas are identified by “(Critical)” following the applicable area title. 20.5.  Evaluation Requirements.  All areas specified in this chapter are required for a complete positional evaluation (T-3).   156  AFI13-1BCCV2  24 NOVEMBER 2014 20.5.1.  The IQE/RQE positional evaluation demonstrates the examinee’s ability to operate mission systems and apply local theater guidance to effectively accomplish the mission. 20.5.1.1.  The examinee will complete a written examination derived from the MAJCOM MQF and unit derived Local Operating Procedures (T-3). 20.5.1.2.  The examinee will perform duties as the DST during daily flying operations to support evaluation objectives (T-3).  The SEE determines whether the extent of mission activity is sufficient for evaluation purposes.  The evaluation may continue on subsequent days to fully meet evaluation requirements. 20.5.2.  Upon completion of MQT, Stan/Eval will administer a 25-question, written MQE (T-3). The passing score is 85 percent. Stan/Eval will maintain at least two different tests on file or  utilize  a  computer-generated  testing  program  (T-3).    A  positional  evaluation  is  not required upon completion of MQT. 20.5.3.  Upon  successful  completion  of  the  MQE,  give  individuals  CMR  status  and  place them into CT (T-3). 20.6.  Evaluation Objective.  The examinee must demonstrate the ability to accomplish all DST duties safely and effectively IAW technical orders and operations directives (T-3).  A rating of Q, Q- or U will be given to each area (T-2).  Critical areas are rated Q or U (T-2).
