Introduction.  To  meet  the  requirement  of  the  Federal  Managers’  Financial  Integrity  Act (FMFIA), all government agencies must establish, evaluate and report on internal controls, and submit an annual Statement of Assurance (SoA) to the President and the Congress.  1.1.1.  Managers must: 1.1.2.  Apply controls to all administrative, operational, and programmatic functions as well as accounting and financial management; (T-0) 1.1.3.  Ensure internal control costs do not exceed the expected benefits; (T-0) 1.1.4.  Use the annual SoA to report: (T-0) 1.1.4.1.  Compliance with the FMFIA; 1.1.4.2.  Administrative,  operational,  programmatic  and  financial  management  internal control material weaknesses; and, 1.1.4.3.  Plans for taking corrective action to mitigate material weaknesses.    1.2.  Objectives.  The  Managers’  Internal  Control  Program  (MICP)  establishes  the  framework for the Air Force to assess the effectiveness of internal controls and provide reasonable assurance that internal controls comply with three objectives:   1.2.1.  Effectiveness and efficiency of operations  1.2.2.  Reliability of financial reporting.  1.2.3.  Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.   1.3.  Internal  Control  Standards.  Managers  have  the  fundamental  responsibility  to  establish and maintain internal controls in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular  A-123,  Management’s  Responsibility  for  Internal  Control  and  the  United  States Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO)  Standards  for  Internal  Control  (GAO/AIMD-00-21.3.1). The OMB Circular A-123 specifically outlines five standards providing the basis against which  internal  control  is  to  be  evaluated,  to  include  all  aspects  of  operations  whether programmatic, financial or compliance. The five standards are:   1.3.1.  Control Environment.  Understanding management’s attitude, awareness,  and actions, clearly  defined  authority  and  responsibility,  appropriate  delegation  of  authority  and responsibility,  integrity  and  ethical  standards,  commitment  to  competence,  hierarchy  for reporting, proper support for human capital hiring, training, advancing and disciplining. 1.3.2.  Risk Assessment. Identifying internal and external risks, taking into account previous audit  findings,  inspections  and  other  assessments,  and  known  instances  of  noncompliance with laws, regulations and policies; then analyzing risk for potential effect and impact. Some significant events can affect risk, these include: complexity or magnitude of programs or new operations,  extent  of  manual  processes,  related  party  transactions,  decentralized  versus centralized accounting, accounting estimates, new programs, new personnel, new technology, new or amended laws, regulations or accounting standards. AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 5 1.3.3.  Control  Activities.  The  policies,  procedures,  and  mechanisms  in  place  that  ensure management’s  directives  are  carried  out,  such  as  proper  segregation  of  duties,  physical control  over  assets,  proper  authorization,  appropriate  documentation  and  access  to documentation, analytical review and analysis, and safeguarding information. 1.3.4.  Information  and  Communications.    Information  should  be  communicated  to  relevant personnel  at  all  levels  within  an  organization.  The  information  should  be  relevant,  reliable, and timely.  It is also crucial that an agency communicate with outside organizations as well, whether providing information or receiving it.  1.3.5.  Monitoring.  Management  should  conduct  periodic  reviews the effectiveness  of  internal  controls  through  self-assessment  by  management,  direct  testing  or evaluations from the Inspector General (IG), auditors, or other assessment organizations. The assessment  should  include  obtaining  an  understanding  of  the  major  types  of  activities  the agency uses to monitor internal control and how those activities are used to initiate corrective actions. Every step of the assessment process should be documented. to  determine 1.4.  Roles  and  Responsibilities.  Note:  The  MICP  roles  are  inherently  governmental.  Only civilian  employees  and/or  military  members  of  the  Air  Force,  to  include  direct-hire  foreign national  employees,  are  authorized  to  serve  in  the  MICP  roles  listed  below.    Contractors  or indirect-hire foreign national employees are not authorized to serve in the MICP roles indicated; however, contractors or indirect-hire foreign nationals may assist with most administrative tasks related to the preparation of the annual statement of assurance.  1.4.1.  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SECAF):  As  the  Head  of  a  Department  of  Defense (DoD)  component,  the  Secretary  of  the  Air Force  signs  and  submits  an  annual  SoA  to  the Secretary of Defense on the assessment of the Air Force’s internal controls.

MICP  Implementation.  The  Air Force  will  implement  the  MICP  at  all  levels.  (T-1) Leadership  includes  as  part  of  their  basic  management  philosophy  a  culture  to  sustain organizational  support  for  internal  controls  and  internal  control  processes  to  improve effectiveness  and  accountability  for  results.    Managers  prevent  this  process  from  becoming  an isolated exercise.  Periodic assessments should be integrated as part of management’s continuous monitoring of internal control.  To the greatest extent possible, the MICP should be consolidated with daily operating and management practices and utilize existing evaluative processes.   Managers will implement the MICP as follows:  2.1.1.  Segment the organization into assessable units.  Divide each primary and subordinate reporting organization into entities capable of being evaluated by internal control assessment procedures as outlined in paragraph 2.2;  (T-1) 2.1.2.  Develop a management control plan as defined in paragraph 2.3; (T-1) 2.1.3.  Perform  a  risk  assessment  to  identify  potential  hazards  that  prevents  the  AU  from achieving its objectives, document findings and implement the internal controls necessary to mitigate the risks as defined in paragraph 2.4; (T-1) 2.1.4.  Conduct  and  document  internal  control  assessments  as  described  in  paragraph  2.5.2; (T-1) 2.1.5.  Develop  and  implement  corrective  action  plans  for  identified  deficiencies  and weaknesses as outlined in paragraph 2.6; (T-1) and, 2.1.6.  Prepare  a  SoA  that  provides  an  overall  level  of  assurance  of  the  effectiveness  of internal  controls  as  described  in  paragraph  3.2,  and  discloses  internal  control  material weaknesses. (T-1) 2.2.  Segmentation. 2.2.1.  PREs  should  be  segmented  along  organizational,  programmatic,  or  functional  lines into AUs so that all subcomponents or organizations under the direct authority, supervision, and/or  responsibility  of  the  Department  of  the  Air Force  are  identified  as  a  separate  and distinct AU or are included as a part of another AU. The sum  of the AUs encompasses the entire organization.  No Air Force activity or program is exempt from the requirements of the MICP.    This  includes  all  personnel  assigned  to  Air Force  organizations  and  reporting organizations for which the Air Force serves as the executive agent. 2.2.2.  PREs  may  determine  how  far  the  segmentation  should  progress  in  order  to  achieve adequate oversight of internal control responsibilities.  Designate AUs of appropriate nature and  size  that  a  single  manager  may  be  held  responsible  for  the  assessment  of  internal controls.    To  the  extent  practical,  standardize  AUs  and  associated  internal  controls  for  the operation of common functions and activities throughout organizations.   AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 13 2.2.3.  AUs are mandated to meet the following criteria: 2.2.3.1.  Have  clear  limits  or  boundaries  and  be  identifiable  to  a  specific  responsible manager; 2.2.3.2.  Be  large  enough  to  allow  observations  that  provide  reasonable  assurance  that internal  controls  are  in  place  and  adequate,  but  not  so  large  that  any  material  weakness goes  un-detected.    The  AUM  should  have  a  span  of  control  to  be  able  to  actively participate in the review process. 2.2.3.3.  For  activities  or  functions  that  are  contracted  out,  Air Force  managers performing  related  functions  that  are  inherently  governmental  in  nature  (for  example, property  accountability,  contract  administration,  and  quality  assurance)  must  form  the assessable unit over that activity or function. (T-1) 2.3.  Management Control Plan (MCP). 2.3.1.  PREs  identified  in  paragraph  1.4.4.1  shall  establish  and  maintain  a  comprehensive MCP detailing the PRE’s assessable units and the processes  and procedures for conducting the MICP.  (T-1) An AU inventory is maintained in a MCP which should be updated at least annually. (T-1) 2.3.2.  The  MCP  includes  at  a  minimum:  number  of  AUs,  title  of  each  AU,  responsible AUM,  date  of  last  MCP  review,  responsible  AUA,  status  of  AUM  training,  material weaknesses  and  significant  deficiencies,  if  reported,  and  corrective  action  plans,  if applicable. 2.4.  Risk Assessment. 2.4.1.  Prior to assessing risk, management must establish a clear mission and objectives for the assessable unit. (T-1) 2.4.2.  A  risk  assessment  determines  where  a  potential  hazard  exists  that  might  prevent  the organization  from  achieving  its  objectives.    The  risk  assessment  should  be  updated  as policies,  procedures  and  missions  change  within  the  AU.    Asking  the  following  questions may help to identify risks:  2.4.2.1.  What could go wrong in the process? 2.4.2.2.  What processes require the most judgment? 2.4.2.3.  What processes are the most complex?  2.4.2.4.  What has to go right for mission success?  2.4.2.5.  How could we fail to accomplish our objectives?  2.4.2.6.  How do we know whether we are achieving our objectives? 2.4.2.7.  Where are our vulnerable areas? 2.4.3.  Management should  identify  and document  risks that are internal  and external  to  the organization as a part of standard operating procedures. Specific analysis methods can vary by organization due to varying mission requirements and difficulty assigning qualitative and quantitative  risk  levels.  Management  should  consider  the  significance  of  the  risk  (low, medium, high), likelihood of occurrence, and what actions should be taken.  14 AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 2.4.4.  Management should also consider the following when assessing risk: previous reports and  findings;  e.g.,  auditor  identified,  results  of  internal  management  reviews,  non-compliance with laws, regulations, policies and procedures within the organization.  2.4.5.  Management should  consider mechanisms  for assessing  special risks associated with changing environment and mission conditions. Existing risk management programs and tools should  be  leveraged  where  possible.    Procedures  and  policies  outlined  in  AFI  90-901, Operational Risk Management, may be used as a basis for MICP risk assessments; however, safety  programs  alone  do  not  address  all  potential  risks  an  assessable  unit  may  face  in accomplishing its mission and safeguarding its assets.  Risk assessments, as a part of safety programs, contribute to, but do not likely fully satisfy the requirement for an AUM to assess risks under the MICP. 2.5.  Internal Control Assessment. 2.5.1.  AUMs are responsible for continuously monitoring their internal controls. 2.5.2.  Internal  control  assessments  are  performed  by  or  at  the  direction  of  AUMs  to determine  whether  internal  controls  exist,  are  correctly  implemented,  and  to  ensure  that internal  control  systems  are  working  effectively  to  mitigate  risks.  Internal  control assessments are of two broad types: 1) a specific detailed examination of internal controls in a prescribed review format especially designed for that purpose, (see paragraph 2.5.5.) or  2) using  a  variety  of  assessment  processes  that  provide  adequate  information  regarding  the effectiveness of control techniques (see paragraph 2.5.4.).  2.5.3.  AUMs must: 2.5.3.1.  Develop  and  communicate  a  written  description  of  the  organizations  goals  and corresponding  internal  controls.    These  descriptions  may  already  exist  in  current regulations, standard operating procedures, and other similar documentation.  (T-1) If the observed  controls  differ  from  the  AU’s  written  description,  the  AUMs  will  update  the description of the controls; (T-1) 2.5.3.2.  Evaluate their internal controls so that excessive controls can be eliminated and weak controls can be improved; (T-1) and, 2.5.3.3.  Ensure  internal  control  assessments  are  documented  and  the  documentation  is maintained as a part of the AU MICP and in compliance with AFRIMS. (T-1) 2.5.4.  In  order  to  streamline  the  process  of  reviewing  internal  control  systems,  DoDI 5010.40,  Mangers’  Internal  Control  Program,  encourages  managers  to  rely  on  existing internal control reviews.  Managers shall not duplicate existing reviews that have included a specific  assessment  of  internal  controls  and  are  properly  documented.  (T-1)  Managers  are encouraged  to  utilize  the  following  sources  of  information  for  existing  internal  control assessments: 2.5.4.1.  Management and oversight reviews; 2.5.4.2.  Computer security reviews;  2.5.4.3.  Air  Force  Audit  Agency  (AFAA),  Department  of  Defense  Inspector  General (DoDIG) and GAO audits, inspections, or investigations;  AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 15 2.5.4.4.  Annual  assessments  performed in  accordance  with  other statutory  requirements such  as  the  Federal  Information  Security  Management  Act  (FISMA),  Government Performance  and  Results  Act,  Improper  Payments  Information  Act,  and  Clinger-Cohen Act; 2.5.4.5.  System compliance reviews; 2.5.4.6.  Program evaluations; 2.5.4.7.  Self-inspection program, Staff Assist Visits (SAV); 2.5.4.8.  Unit Compliance Inspections (UCI); and, 2.5.4.9.  Quality Assurance (QA) reviews. 2.5.5.  If  an  existing  assessment  of  controls  is  not  available,  then  an  appropriate  internal control  review  is  performed  for  the  assessable  unit.    Locally  developed  review  formats  are used and shall be completed with consideration of the Internal Control Standards (paragraph 1.3.).  The Air Force has developed  a standard review format that  can  also  be used for this purpose.  It conforms to all program requirements of OMB and DoD, and is available from the  SAF/FMFA  program  office.    The  standard  format  is  a  simple  and  uniform  way  of conducting and documenting the accomplishment of an internal control evaluation.    2.6.  Corrective Action Plan: 2.6.1.  An AUM must prepare and implement a corrective action plan for all internal control material  weaknesses  as  they  are  identified.  (T-1)  The  correction  of  internal  control weaknesses is an integral part of management accountability and is considered a priority.  It makes  no  difference  if  the  weakness  is  systemic  or  if  the  weakness  is  merely  a  failure  to follow established procedures.  In both cases, the weakness is reported and corrected.  2.6.2.  The  recommendations  for  corrective  action  correlate  with  the  risk.    In  some  cases management  should  strengthen  the  existing  controls,  and  in  others,  management  should include new controls.   Managers must always consider the materiality of the  weakness  and the cost implications of actions to correct it when determining a corrective action plan. (T-1) 2.6.3.  A corrective action plan identifies specific actions and completion dates for correcting the  material  weakness.    The  plan  lists  the  tasks,  called  milestones,  together  with  interim target dates for accomplishment.  Milestones may be revised as required.  The final milestone is one of verifying that the corrective actions achieved the desired results.  2.6.4.  For  internal  control  deficiencies  that  are  not  included  as  material  weaknesses  in  the SoA, corrective actions are developed and tracked internally at the appropriate level. 2.6.5.  The  performance  appraisal  of  the  responsible  senior  management  official  for correction of material weaknesses reported in the Secretary’s SoA evaluates the effective and timely resolution of the material weakness IAW DoDI 5010.40.  16 AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 Chapter 3 REPORTING 3.1.  General.  The reports relating to the MICP have been assigned Report Control Symbol DD-Comp  AR  1618.    The  Undersecretary  of  Defense,  Comptroller  (OUSD(C))  issues  reporting guidelines  and  formats  for  all  required  reports.    SAF/FM  will  issue  appropriate  call  letters  to PREs transmitting the prescribed guidance and current reporting formats. 3.2.  Air Force Statement of Assurance: 3.2.1.  SAF/FM  will  prepare  the  Air Force  SoA  according  to  instructions  received  from  the OUSD(C).    The  statement  provides  the  Secretary  of  the  Air Force’s  level  of  reasonable assurance  of  the  effectiveness  of  Air Force  internal  controls.    A  single  cover  memorandum states the senior management assessment as to whether or not there is reasonable assurance that  the  Air Force’s  internal  controls  are  in  place  and  operating  effectively  in  three  distinct processes.   3.2.1.1.  Operational  and  administrative  controls  assessment  relevant  to  all  mission-essential functions throughout the Air Force. 3.2.1.2.  Financial  reporting  assessment  relevant  to  the  Air  Force  General  Fund  and  the Air Force Working Capital Fund functions assessed under the oversight of the SAT.  (See chapter 4). 3.2.1.3.  Financial  Systems  Assessment  relevant  to  the  integrated  financial  management system’s conformance with Federal requirements (See chapter 5). 3.2.2.  Each assessment takes one of the following forms: 3.2.2.1.  Unmodified  statement  of  assurance.    An  unmodified  SoA  provides  reasonable assurance that internal controls are effective with no material weaknesses.   3.2.2.2.  Modified  statement  of  assurance.    A  modified  SoA  provides  reasonable assurance that internal  controls are effective with the exception of one or more material weakness.  The SoA must cite the material weaknesses in internal controls that preclude an unmodified statement.   3.2.2.3.  Statement  of  No  Assurance.    A  statement  of  no  assurance  provides  that  no assurance  can  be  provided  that  internal  controls  are  effective  because  few  or  no assessments were conducted or the noted material weaknesses are pervasive across many key operations.   3.2.3.  Where the annual SoA provides an unmodified statement of assurance, it is supported by  clear  indications  that  AUMs  understand  and  adhere  to  the  GAO  Standards  for  internal control  in  the  Federal  Government,  are  formally  held  accountable  for  the  effectiveness  of their internal controls, have evaluated key internal controls as applicable to the AU, reported material weaknesses, if any, and have taken corrective action to resolve them. 3.2.4.  Where the annual SoA provides a “modified” statement of assurance, the area or areas in question are specified and related to material weaknesses being reported. AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 17 3.2.5.  The body of the statement provides a description of how the MICP was implemented during the year, improvements and innovations to the program, overview of training, disclose material weaknesses, describe the plans and schedules for correcting those weaknesses, and give the status of corrective actions on prior year weaknesses.  3.3.  Supporting Statements of Assurance: 3.3.1.  Each PRE must submit a supporting operational  and administrative control SoA that provides  an  overall  level  of  assurance  as  described  in  paragraph  3.2.2.  (T-1)    These supporting statements formulate the collective basis for the Secretary's SoA. (T-1) 3.3.2.  SAF/AA and SAF/FM  will address their  SoA to  the Secretary  of  the Air Force.  All other PREs will address their SoA to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. (T-1)  All statements are  due  on  the  date  designated  by  the  annual  call  letter.    PRE  supporting  statements  are submitted to SAF/FMFA for review and to support development of the Secretary's SoA. 3.3.3.  Field  Operating  Agencies  (FOA)  will  address  their  statements,  if  required  by provisions  of  paragraph  1.4.4.,  to  the  appropriate  Secretariat  or  Air  Staff  oversight organization.  (T-1)    Accordingly,  oversight  organizations'  supporting  SoA  will  include responsibility for the evaluation and reporting on internal controls of their designated FOAs. (T-1) 3.3.4.  PREs must develop a building block process to support their annual statements. (T-1) A  supporting  letter  or  SoA  from  each  echelon  to  the  next  higher  echelon  as  determined  in paragraph  2.2.  is  mandated.    These  submissions  serve  as  supporting  documentation  to  the PRE statement and are maintained in compliance with the AF Records Disposition Schedule in AFRIMS.  3.3.5.  The  SoA  completed  at  the  subordinate  level  may  disclose  weaknesses  of  varying degrees  of  significance  to  the  PRE  as  a  whole.    Management  shall  collect,  analyze  and document  those  crosscutting  weaknesses  or  items  common  to  several  units  and  other significant deficiencies and consider whether they are appropriate for inclusion in the SoA to the  next  higher-level  official.  (T-1)  Reference  the  DoDI  5200.1-R  Information  Security Program, to ensure documents containing potential weaknesses and deficiencies are properly marked and safeguarded if necessary.   3.3.6.  The  supporting  SoA  is  based  on  management’s  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of internal controls as of the end of the current fiscal year.  Practical considerations of preparing a year-end statement in advance of the completion date may require an earlier cutoff date for internal  processing  and  coordination.    Significant  findings,  after  the  administrative  cutoff date, are forwarded immediately to the AU’s next level of management for amendment to its supporting  statement.    Administrative  results  and  minor  findings  are  reported  in  the subsequent reporting period.   3.4.  Concept of Reasonable Assurance: 3.4.1.  In  the  context  of  the  FMFIA,  "reasonable  assurance"  refers  to  a  satisfactory  level  of management  confidence  that  internal  controls  are  adequate  and  operating  as  intended.  Inherently  a  management  judgment,  reasonable  assurance  recognizes  that  acceptable  levels of  risk  exist  due  to  outside  factors  which  cannot  be  avoided  or  the  cost  of  management’s ability to achieve absolute control would exceed the benefits derived. 18 AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 3.4.2.  The determination of reasonable assurance is a subjective management judgment.  The subjectivity of this judgment can be reduced significantly by considering the following: 3.4.2.1.  The degree to which all AUMs understand and adhere to the GAO Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and the OMB Circular A-123. 3.4.2.2.  The degree to which AUMs are held formally accountable for the effectiveness of their internal controls and are evaluated on their performance in this regard. 3.4.2.3.  The  timeliness,  adequacy,  and  results  of  internal  control  evaluations,  including the correction of any internal control weaknesses detected. 3.4.2.4.  Assessments  from  other  sources  (for  example,  audits,  inspections,  and investigations);  media  coverage;  and  direct  management  reviews  or  assessments  by senior officials. 3.4.2.5.  Supporting SoA from subordinate AUMs. 3.5.  Classification of Control Deficiencies. 3.5.1.  Deficiencies in internal controls must be reported by the AUM if they are deemed to be  material  to  the  AU.  (T-1)  Noncompliance  with  existing  internal  controls  or  ineffective internal controls shall be reported by the responsible AUM as a part of their supporting SoA. (T-1) 3.5.2.  Subordinate AUMs must report deficiencies that are either material enough to warrant the  attention  of  more  senior  management  or  require  the  participation  of  more  senior management  to  resolve.  (T-1)  This  information  may  be  modified  by  management  as  it  is reported  forward.    As  part  of  the  aggregation  process,  senior  management  may  delete  less significant  control  deficiencies  and  may  add  new  items  which  apply  at  more  senior organizational  levels.  Thus,  what  may  be  a  material  weakness  at  one  level  may  not  be material  at  the  next  higher  level.  If  the  decision  is  made  to  exclude  a  material  weakness during the reporting process, this decision is clearly documented and retained as a part of the AU’s  MCP  for  review.  This  process  culminates  with  the  PRE  denoted  in  paragraph  1.4.4., reporting  their  most  significant  internal  control  problems  in  their  supporting  SoA.  EXCEPTION:  “Significant  Deficiencies” in accordance with the FISMA of 2002 are reported as a material weakness under ICOFS (See chapter 5). identified  from  evaluations  conducted 3.5.3.  A control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does not  allow management  or  employees,  in  the  normal  course  of  performing  their  assigned  functions,  to satisfactorily  accomplish  their  assigned  functions  or  inhibits  the  prevention  or  detection  of misstatements on a timely basis.  Control deficiencies are internal to the Assessable Unit and listed in the MCP of the reporting AU. 3.5.4.  An  overall  significant  deficiency  is  a  control  deficiency  or  combination  of  control deficiencies  that  in  management’s  judgment,  represents  deficiencies  in  the  design  or operation of internal controls that could adversely affect the organization’s ability to meet its objectives.    A  significant  deficiency  specifically  related  to  financial  reporting  is  a  control deficiency,  or  combination  of  control  deficiencies,  that  adversely  affects  the  organization’s ability  to  initiate,  authorize,  record,  process,  or  report  financial  data  reliably  in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The criteria for a significant deficiency means AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 19 that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the financial statements that is  more  than  inconsequential  will  not  be  prevented  or  detected.  Significant  deficiencies  are internal to the Assessable Unit and listed in the MCP of the reporting AU. 3.5.5.  To be considered material, a weakness must meet the following two conditions: 3.5.5.1.  It  must  involve  a  weakness  in  internal  controls,  such  as  the  controls  are  not  in place, are not being used or are inadequate. Resource deficiencies in themselves are not internal control weaknesses.  3.5.5.2.  It must warrant  the attention of the next  level  of command, either because that next level must take action or because they must be aware of the problem. This requires management’s judgment, particularly in determining whether the next level of command must be aware of a weakness. The fact that a weakness can be corrected at one level does not  exclude  it  from  being  reported  to  the  next  level;  demonstrating  the  ability  to effectively  identify  internal  control  weaknesses  is  one  of  the  primary  reasons  for reporting a material weakness. 3.5.6.  Material weaknesses are defined as having the potential to: Impair or potentially impair essential operations or mission, violate statutory or regulatory requirements, deprive the public of needed government services, endanger national security, cause adverse publicity or embarrassment, diminish credibility or reputation, lead to waste or loss of funds, property, or other resources, allow fraud or other criminal activity to go undetected, cause harm, even though minor individually, because it can be extensive in the aggregate, or cause loss of control over a significant amount of the resources for which an organization is responsible (including resources other than money; i.e., personnel, equipment, etc.).  3.5.6.1.  Material  weaknesses  can  be  identified  by  other  organizations,  such  as  OSD functional  offices,  GAO,  DoDIG,  or  AFAA.    AUMs  give  strong  consideration  to  these recommendations  and  work  toward  a  consensus  on  material  weakness  reporting  with these offices. 3.6.  Material Weakness Quarterly Reporting: 3.6.1.  All PRE’s must provide a quarterly update on the status of corrective actions related to open material weaknesses to the SAF/FMF.  (T-1) The 1st and 2nd quarterly updates are due on  the  10th  business  day  after  the  end  of  the  quarter.    The  submission  of  the  PRE’s  SoA serves as the 3rd quarter update and the coordination and review of the Air Force SoA serves as the 4th quarter update. 3.6.2.  Identify  and  report  all  material  weaknesses  according  to  standard  DoD  Internal Control reporting categories.  See Attachment 2 for the list of reporting categories. 3.7.  Weakness Tracking System: 3.7.1.  SAF/FMFA will maintain a summary of all material weaknesses.  PREs must maintain a  subordinate  system  to  track  their  own  material  weaknesses.  (T-1)  Information  in  the tracking system must include the Internal Control Reporting Category, narrative description of the problem, corrective action milestone chart and the name of the responsible official and point of contact for corrective action progress. 20 AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 3.7.2.  A  material  weakness  may  be  reported  as  closed  only  after  corrective  actions  are verified as effective.  This verification may be completed by specific management reviews, follow-on  audits,  metric  tracking,  or  other  independent  validation.  There  must  be  sufficient time between implementation of the final corrective action and verification of the corrective actions  to  demonstrate  internal  controls  are  working  properly  in  normal  operations.    The verification shall be documented and the documentation maintained as a part of the reporting agency’s  weakness  tracking  system  and  shall  be  maintained  IAW  AFMAN  33-363  and disposed  of  IAW  the  AF  Records  Disposition  Schedule  in  AFRIMS.    The  documentation must  be  sufficient  enough  for  an  independent  reviewer  to  reach  a  similar  conclusion.    A material weakness cannot be closed until the verification is complete. 3.7.3.  When possible the audit follow-up process as required in AFI 65-403 may be used to track the planned corrective actions for each internal control weakness stemming from audit reports.  Corrective action plans must be consistent with corrective action status reports in the audit follow-up process. AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 21 Chapter 4 INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 4.1.  Overview.  Appendix A of OMB Circular A-123, mandates a robust process for assessing, documenting, and reporting on the effectiveness of ICOFR.  This is to include internal controls over  the  Air Force’s  annual  financial  statements  and  other  significant  internal  or  external financial reports. 4.1.1.  The OUSD(C) requires an assurance statement from the Secretary of the Air Force on the  effectiveness  of  ICOFR  reporting  as  part  of  the  SoA.    This  statement  is  based  on  the results  of  assessments  and  deliverables  completed  in  accordance  with  the  United  States Air Force  Implementation  Guidance  for  OMB  Circular  A-123,  Appendix  A  issued  by SAF/FMF. 4.1.2.  The  ICOFR  effort  is  completed  in  addition  to  the  required  efforts  for  all  AUs  under the  MICP.    SAF/FM  centrally  directs  the  overall  Air Force  ICOFR  focus  areas  and deliverable  response  to  OUSD(C).    In  order  to  meet  these  requirements,  SAF/FM  will  task functional Air Staff and Major Command activities to perform work related to the processes detailed in this section.  These tasks are considered part of the AU MICP responsibilities and given a high priority.   4.2.  Reasonable  Assurance.  Appendix  A  of  OMB  Circular  A-123  requires  reasonable assurance  over  financial  reporting  such  that  management  can  reasonably  make  the  following assertions: 4.2.1.  All  reported  transactions  actually  occurred  during  the  reporting  period  and  all  assets and liabilities exist as of the reporting date (existence and occurrence); 4.2.2.  All assets, liabilities, and transactions that should be reported have been included and no unauthorized transactions or balances are included (completeness); 4.2.3.  All  assets  are  legally  owned  by  the  agency  and  all  liabilities  are  legal  obligations  of the agency (rights and obligations); 4.2.4.  All  assets  and  liabilities  have  been  properly  valued,  and  where  applicable,  all  costs have been properly allocated (valuation); 4.2.5.  The financial report  is  presented in  the proper form  and any  required disclosures are present (presentation and disclosure); 4.2.6.  The transactions are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations (compliance); 4.2.7.  All assets have been safeguarded against fraud and abuse; and 4.2.8.  Documentation  for  internal  control,  all  transactions,  and  other  significant  events  is readily available for examination. 4.3.  Internal Control Standards.  Management is responsible for developing, documenting and maintaining  internal  control  activities  over  financial  reporting  that  comply  with  the  following OMB and GAO standards: 4.3.1.  Control Environment: Understanding management’s attitude, awareness, and actions, clearly  defined  authority  and  responsibility,  appropriate  delegation  of  authority  and 22 AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 responsibility,  integrity  and  ethical  standards,  commitment  to  competence,  hierarchy  for reporting, proper support for human capital hiring, training, advancing and disciplining. 4.3.2.  Risk Assessment: Identifying internal and external risks, taking into account previous audit  findings,  internal  management  reviews,  noncompliance  with  laws,  regulations  and policies;  then  analyzing  risk  for  potential  effect  and  impact.  Some  significant  events  can affect risk, these include: complexity or magnitude of programs or new operations, extent of manual  processes,  related  party  transactions,  decentralized  versus  centralized  accounting, accounting estimates, new programs, personnel, technology, or amended laws, regulations or accounting standards. 4.3.3.  Control  Activities:    The  policies,  procedures,  and  mechanisms  in  place  that  ensure management’s  directives  are  carried  out,  such  as  proper  segregation  of  duties,  physical control  over  assets,  proper  authorization,  appropriate  documentation  and  access  to documentation, analytical review and analysis, and safeguarding information. 4.3.4.  Information and Communication: Includes obtaining an understanding of the financial systems,  communicating  the  duties  and  responsibilities  to  personnel  for  proper  handling  of external  information,  planning  for  disaster  recovery,  and  determining  the  type  and sufficiency of reports produced. 4.3.5.  Monitoring: Management shall conduct periodic reviews to determine effectiveness of internal controls through self-assessment by management, direct testing or evaluations from the  IG,  auditors,  or  other  assessment  organizations.  (T-1)  The  assessment  will  include obtaining  an  understanding  of  the  major  types  of  activities  the  agency  uses  to  monitor internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  how  those  activities  are  used  to  initiate corrective actions. 4.3.6.  The GAO Financial Audit Manual identifies three types of audit risk components: 4.3.6.1.  Inherent  Risk  –  the  original  susceptibility  to  a  potential  hazard  or  material misstatement, assuming there are no related specific control activities. 4.3.6.2.  Control  Risk  –  the  risk  that  a  hazard  or  misstatement  will  not  be  prevented  or detected by the internal control. 4.3.6.3.  Combined  Risk  –  also  known  as  residual  risk;  the  likelihood  that  a  hazard  or material misstatement would occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the agency’s internal control. 4.4.  ICOFR  Assessment.  OMB  A-123  Appendix  A  prescribes  a  process  for  management  to assess internal control over financial reporting. The process includes: 4.4.1.  Establishing a high-level governance body such as a Senior Assessment Team (SAT).  The SAT should provide oversight of the assessment process and is responsible for: 4.4.1.1.  Ensuring  that  assessment  objectives  are  clearly  communicated  throughout  the agency; 4.4.1.2.  Ensuring  that  the  assessment  is  carried  out  in  a  thorough,  effective,  and  timely manner; 4.4.1.3.  Identifying and ensuring adequate funding and resources are made available; AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 23 4.4.1.4.  Identifying staff and/or securing contractors to perform the assessment; 4.4.1.5.  Determining the scope of the assessment, i.e., those financial reports covered by the assessment; and 4.4.1.6.  Determining the assessment design and methodology. 4.4.2.  Evaluating internal control at the entity level which encompasses the 5 components of internal  controls  as  outlined  in  detail  in  4.3:  control  environment,  risk  assessment,  control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. 4.4.3.  Evaluating  internal  control  at  the  process,  transaction,  or  application  levels. Management’s  knowledge  of  daily  operations,  significant  accounts  or  groups  of  accounts, major  classes  of  transactions,  understanding  the  financial  reporting  process,  understanding control  design,  ability  to  identify  controls  not  adequately  designed,  test  controls  and  assess compliance to support management’s assertions.  Obtaining knowledge of the organization’s key  processes  through  performance  of  process  risk  assessments  of  financial  assertions, providing reasonable assurance of completeness, rights and obligations, valuation, existence and occurrence, presentation and disclosure, as well as compliance with laws and regulations; while safeguarding assets from fraud, waste, and abuse and identifying existing key controls intended to mitigate identified risk. 4.4.4.  Assessing  and  testing  the  design  and  operation  of  ICOFR,  the  assessment  should determine  whether  internal  controls  are  operating  effectively  and  identify  if  a  material weakness exists in the design or operation. 4.4.5.  Management  shall  assess  ICOFR  using  a  variety  of  information  sources,  including those  specific  to  internal  control  reviews  or  as  a  by-product  of  other  reviews,  such  as  IG, GAO,  and  AFAA  audit  reports.  (T-1)  The  assessment  of  internal  control  over  financial reporting  should  be  coordinated  with  other  activities  to  avoid  duplication  of  efforts  with similar activities. 4.4.6.  Documenting the entire assessment process from the establishment of a SAT including key  decisions,  to  the  identification  of  deficiencies  and  development  of  corrective  action plans.  Documentation  can  be  electronic  or  hard  copy  and  shall  be  readily  available  for review.  Documentation  shall  be  maintained  for  weaknesses  that  are  downgraded  from  a significant deficiency to a control deficiency in order to support management decisions. 4.4.7.  Issue  a  SoA  of  ICOFR  as  a  subset  of  the  Annual  Statement  of  Assurance.  The statement  must  take  one  of  the  following  forms:  unmodified,  modified,  or  statement  of  no assurance.  4.5.  Materiality.  Risk  assessments  under  ICOFR  must  contain  a  risk  analysis  of  all  material business  processes  that  affect  financial  reporting  with  specific  focus  on  those  business  events that  significantly  increase  or  decrease  financial  statement  balances.    The  Air Force’s  planning level of materiality is 0.99 percent of adjusted assets for Balance Sheet accounts and 0.99 percent of total budgetary resources for Statement of Budgetary Resources accounts.  Other factors such as  transaction  volume,  program  visibility,  or  command  directed  focus  areas  may  also  be considered in determining materiality.   24 AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 4.6.  Material  Weaknesses.  The  criteria  for  an  ICOFR  material  weakness  differs  from  that described in paragraph 3.6.  An ICOFR material weakness is a deficiency that adversely affects the Air Force’s ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external financial data that will  result  in  more  than  a  remote  likelihood  of  a  material  misstatement  of  the  financial statements,  or  other  significant  financial  reports,  that  do  not  prevent  or  detect  a  material weakness.  Corrective action milestones for ICOFR material weakness are reported as part of the Financial Improvement Plans (FIPs).  4.6.1.  All  Air Force  AUMs  may  be  responsible  for  corrective  action  of  ICOFR  material weaknesses impacting their organization or function, as the root causes of the weakness may not be limited to financial management.   Corrective action of ICOFR material weaknesses:  4.6.1.1.  Require prompt resolution of corrective actions.  4.6.1.2.  Provide for appointment of an overall corrective action accountable official from senior management, reporting to the SAT if applicable. 4.6.2.  Assure  that  performance  appraisals  of  appropriate  officials  reflect  effectiveness  in resolving  or  implementing  corrective  action  for  the  identified  material  weakness  IAW  the OMB  Circular  A-123,  chapter  V,  Correcting  Internal  Control  Deficiencies;  AFI  36-1001, Managing  the  Civilian  Performance  Program,  paragraph  A3.2.3;  and  the  GAO/AIMD-00-21.3.1, Standards for Internal Controls - Management of Human Capital,   4.6.3.  Maintain accurate records on the status of the identified material weaknesses through the entire process of resolution and corrective action. 4.6.4.  Assure  that  the  corrective  action  plans  are  consistent  with  laws,  regulations,  and administration policy.   A determination that a material  weakness  has been corrected should be  made  only  when  sufficient  corrective  actions  have  been  taken  and  the  desired  results achieved  consistent  with  Paragraph  3.7.2.  Along  with  testing  of  the  applicable  internal controls,  resolution  of  an  ICOFR  material  weakness  may  also  require  financial  statement balance reconciliation and validation to ensure the controls are effective. This determination shall  be  made  in  writing  and  include  supporting  documentation  available  for  review  by  the SAT. AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 25 Chapter 5 INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL SYSTEMS 5.1.  Overview.  It is the responsibility of all Air Force managers that develop, deploy or sustain information  systems,  to  effectively  develop  and  maintain  ICOFS.    The  Integrated  Financial Management  System  (IFMS)  is  the  unified  set  of  Air Force  financial  systems  and  financial portions  of  mixed  systems  that  encompass  the  hardware,  software,  personnel,  processes, procedures,  controls  and  data  necessary  to  carry  out  financial  management  functions  and operations. OUSD(C) requires a separate assurance statement from the Secretary of the Air Force on the effectiveness of ICOFS as a subset of the annual SoA.   5.1.1.  The  ICOFS  effort  is  in  addition  to  the  required  efforts  for  all  AUs  under  the  MICP.  SAF/FM  centrally  directs  the  overall  Air Force  ICOFS  response  to  OUSD(C).    In  order  to meet  these  requirements,  SAF/FM  will  task  functional  Secretariat,  Air  Staff  and  Major Command activities to perform work related to the processes detailed in this section.  These tasks are considered part of the AU MICP responsibilities and given a high priority. 5.2.  Internal  Control  Standards.  Management  shall  ensure  the  effectiveness  of  security controls over information resources that support Air Force operations and assets. (T-1) The two broad groups of information system controls are application controls that cover the processing of data  within  the  application  software,  and  general  controls  that  apply  to  all  mainframe, minicomputer  and  network  systems,  (core  financial  systems).    These  controls  are  interrelated; both are needed to ensure complete and accurate information processing. 5.2.1.  Management shall ensure the controls are adequate and are proportionate with the risk.  (T-1) 5.2.2.  Management shall prepare a report on the effectiveness of the ICOFS. (T-1) 5.2.3.  Management shall disclosed material weaknesses in the annual SoA and must include specific plans and schedules for corrective actions. (T-1) Each material weakness corrective action  plan  will  follow  procedures  as  described  in  paragraph  3.6,  and  shall  include  a validation milestone which evaluates and certifies the effectiveness of the corrective action. 5.2.4.  The ICOFS SoA is based on the results of assessments completed in accordance with; the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA), Public Law 104-208, Title  VIII  (31  U.S.C.  3512  note),  OMB  Circular  A-123,  OMB  Circular  A-127  Financial Management Systems, OMB Circular A-130 Management of Federal Information Resources, DoD  Financial  Management  Regulation  (DoDFMR)  Volume  1,  Chapter  3  and  the  GAO Standards for Internal Control. 5.3.  Assessment.  Management  must  ensure  that  proper  controls,  manual  or  automated,  are  in place for the operation of the IFMS as well as the management of the system functionality as part of the MICP. (T-1)  Key considerations when developing IFMS internal controls include, but are not limited to: 5.3.1.  Management  must  have  controls  over  information  which  is  not  directly  transferred from  the  accounting  system  to  the  financial  report,  but  requires  intervening  calculation, summarizations, etc.  (T-1) 26 AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 5.3.2.  Data transfers to core financial systems must be traceable to the transaction source and posted  to  the  core  financial  system  in  accordance  with  the  Federal  Accounting  Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), to include the United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL). (T-1) 5.3.3.  Controls  must  be  in  place  to  ensure  completeness,  accuracy,  authorization,  and validity of all transactions during application processing. (T-1)  5.3.4.  Data  centers  and  client-server  operation  controls  will  include  backup  and  recovery procedures, contingency and disaster recovery plans. (T-1)  5.3.5.  Access  security  controls  must  be  in  place  to  prevent  un-authorized  internal  and external  access,  such  as  identification  and  authentication,  security  configuration,  physical access and system penetration. (T-1) 5.3.6.  Management  must  consider  system  software  internal  controls  including  control  over the acquisition, implementation, and maintenance of all system software. (T-1) 5.3.7.  Controls shall be established at an application’s interface to verify inputs and outputs. (T-1) 5.4.  Reliability.  Substantial  compliance  with  ICOFS  is  achieved  when  an  agency’s  financial management  systems  routinely  provide  reliable  and  timely  financial  information  for  managing day-to-day operations as well as produce reliable financial statements, maintain effective internal control, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements.  AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 27 Chapter 6 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 6.1.  Special  Access  Programs.  Air Force Special Access Programs (SAP) are established and maintained  when  it  is  necessary  to  protect  the  most  sensitive  capabilities,  information, technologies,  and  operations  or  when  otherwise  mandated  by  statute.  The  Air  Force  must establish  controls,  infrastructure  and  processes  to  manage,  execute  and  protect  the  SAPs.    Key roles  and  responsibilities  for  establishing  a  SAP  are  identified  in  the  AFI  16-701  Oversight, Management and Execution of Special Access Programs. (T-1)  6.1.1.  PREs  have  overall  responsibility  for  their  SAP  AUs  and  will  report  an  unclassified level of assurance over the effectiveness of SAP internal controls in their annual SoA. (T-1) 6.1.2.  Special  Access  Programs  are  required  to  align  their  MICP  efforts  to  the  extent possible to comply with the guidance outlined in this instruction. 6.1.3.  SAF/FMBIB  is  responsible  for  policy,  oversight,  program  review/site  visits,  and training of all special program units/activities for MICP purposes.  6.1.4.  Each SAP AUM will provide a level of reasonable assurance over the effectiveness of internal controls in a supporting statement of assurance through their chain of command up to their PRE with a copy to SAF/FMBIB. (T-1) 6.1.5.  Reporting  and  tracking  of  a  material  weakness  will  be  reported  directly  to SAF/FMBIB upon original determination from the unit/program and command level. Further consideration  and  determination  will  be  accomplished  by  SAF/FMBIB  along  with appropriate  command,  audit,  and  other  SAP  personnel  deemed  necessary.    However,  the process  for  corrective  actions  will  remain  similar  in  nature  and  comply  with  this  guidance. Any  questions  or  concerns  on  handling  material  weaknesses  should  be  directed  to SAF/FMBIB. 6.2.  Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Implications: 6.2.1.  The Department of the Air Force annual SoA may be made available, upon request, to the  general  public,  except  in  the  case  of  any  Statement  containing  certain  restricted information.  The Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act specifies that information in the following categories be deleted from the Statement before it is made available to the public: 6.2.1.1.  Information specifically prohibited from disclosure by any provision of law. 6.2.1.2.  Information  specifically  required  by  Executive  Order  to  be  kept  secret  in  the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs. 6.2.1.3.  All  other  requests  for  information  about  MICP,  internal  control  evaluation results,  supporting  SoAs  or  other  information  developed  through  the  internal  control process  are  to  be  handled  in  accordance  with  procedures  for  release  of  information established by DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, Freedom of Information Act Program.  6.3.  Host Tenant Relationships.  Responsibilities of the MICP follow the chain of command. 6.3.1.  Tenant  units  on  other  MAJCOM  bases  must  perform  internal  control  evaluations  at the direction of the tenant unit's parent command. (T-1) 6.3.2.  The  PA  will  make  recommendations  to  the  commander  where  functions  overlap  or where functional OPRs disagree over who has responsibility for a certain action.

Control Deficiency —A control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does not  allow  management  or  employees,  in  the  normal  course  of  performing  their  assigned 32 AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 functions,  to  satisfactorily  accomplish  their  assigned  functions  or  inhibits  the  prevention  or detection of misstatements on a timely basis.   Control  Risk  —the risk that a hazard or misstatement will not  be prevented or detected by an internal control. Functional  OPR  —Conduct  and  report  on  the  internal  control  assessments  for  their  section, program, or function under an AU. Inherent  Risk  —the  original  susceptibility  to  a  potential  hazard  or  material  misstatement, assuming there are no related specific control activities, such as human error. Internal  Control  —The  organization,  policies,  procedures,  and  instructions  adopted  by management  to  reasonably  ensure  mission  or  operational  objectives  are  met,  and  programs achieve  intended  results,  and  to  help  managers  safeguard  the  integrity  of  their  programs.  The concept of internal control applies to all Air Force activities.   Internal  Control  Assessment  —A  documented  review  performed  by  an  AU  to  determine whether  internal  control  techniques  are  effectively  implemented  to  accomplish  administrative, operational, and mission objectives. Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICOFR) —Provides an explicit level of assurance on  the  effectiveness  of  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting  for  each  financial  statement reporting  entity.  The  assurance  shall  be  based  on  the  results  of  management’s  assessment conducted  according  to  the  requirements  of  OMB  Circular  A-123  Appendix  A  and  the  ICOFR guidance. Internal Control over Financial Systems (ICOFS) —Provides an explicit level of assurance on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial systems.

Internal  Control  over  Nonfinancial  Operations  (ICONO)  —Provides  an  explicit  level  of assurance on the effectiveness of internal controls over non-financial reporting for each entity as it  pertains  to  the  overall  program,  operational,  and  the  administrative  controls  relevant  to  all mission-essential  functions.  The  assurance  shall  be  based  on  the  results  of  management’s assessment  conducted  according  to  the  requirements  of  OMB  Circular  A-123  and  the  GAO Standards.  Managers’  Internal  Control  Program  (MICP)  —The  formal  effort  of  an  organization  to ensure through  assignment  of responsibilities at the policy level, issuance and implementation of guidance, conduct of internal control assessments, and reporting to senior management. internal  control  systems  are  working  effectively that Management  Control  Plan  (MCP)  —A  written  plan  that  details  the  AU’s  inventory  and  is updated  annually.  The  inventory  will  be  maintained  in  the  MCP  and  used  to  monitor  progress and ensure that planned actions are taken. It must include at a minimum: 1) number of AUs, 2) title  of  each  AU,  3)  responsible  AUM,  4)  date  of  last  MCP  review  5)  responsible  AU administrator,  6)  status  of  AUM  training,7)  material  weakness  and  significant  deficiency,  if reported, 8) corrective action plan. Material  Weakness  for  ICOFR  —A  significant  deficiency  or  combination  of  conditions  that adversely  affects  the  entity’s  ability  to  initiate,  authorize,  record,  process,  or  report  external AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 33 financial data reliably and according to generally accepted accounting principles.  The condition creates more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the entity’s financial statements, or other  significant  financial  reports,  is  more  than  inconsequential  and  will  not  be  prevented  or detected.  Material Weakness  for  ICOFS  —The organization’s integrated financial management system is not substantially in conformance with the Federal system requirements. Material  Weakness  for  ICONO  —A  significant  deficiency  that  the  DoD  Component  Head deems significant enough to report to a higher level.  It is management’s judgment as to whether or not a weakness is deemed material. Primary  Reporting  Element  (PRE)  —  All  Major  Commands  (MAJCOM),  the  Air  Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, United States Air Force Academy, Air Force District of Washington, Air National Guard and Army Air Force Exchange Service are designated primary reporting elements of the Air Force MICP.  SAF/FM will report directly to the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF).  Resource Directorate, Office of Administrative Assistant to  the Secretary of  the  Air  Force  (SAF/AAR)  serves  as  the  PRE  for  all  Secretariat  and  Air  Staff  offices.  The heads of these organizations are the Air Force’s highest level Assessable Unit Managers (AUM) who direct the MICP within their organizations.    Program  Administrator  (PA)  —Form  the  MICP  focal  point  network.    The  Program Administrator prepares and maintains the PRE’s MCP. Reasonable  Assurance  —An  informed  judgment,  based  upon  an  evaluation  of  all  available information  that  the  organization's  systems  of  internal  control  are  operating  in  a  manner  that achieves the objectives of the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act. Significant  deficiency  —A  control  deficiency  or  combination  of  control  deficiencies,  that  in management’s judgment represents significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls  that  could  adversely  affect  the  organizations  ability  to  meet  its  internal  control objectives, also known as a significant deficiency.   Senior Assessment Team —A SAT is a team of senior level executives to provide oversight of assessing and documenting the effectiveness of internal controls and FMFIA ICOFR and ICOFS and oversight and risk management for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act expenditures.  Statement  of  Assurance  (SoA)  —An  annual  assessment  in  prescribed  format  that  provides leader’s explicit level of assurance on whether the internal controls are effective.  The SoA is a self-assessment  conducted  for  mission-essential  functions  relative  to  risk  and  identifies  any material weaknesses found.  Unmodified SoA —An unmodified SoA provides reasonable assurance that internal controls are effective  with  no  material  weakness  reported  or  that  the  IFMS  is  in  conformance  with  Federal requirements.  Each  unmodified  statement  must  provide  a  firm  basis  and  evidence  for  that position in the SoA.  34 AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 Attachment 2 REPORTING CATEGORIES A2.1.  Operational  and  Administrative  Reporting  Categories.  Internal  control  deficiencies identified in the assessable unit’s MCP and internal control accomplishments reported in the SoA will be classified using the following categories:  A2.1.1.  Communications.    Communication  requires  a  sender,  message,  and  intended recipient,  although  the  receiver  need  not  be  present  or  aware  of  the  sender’s  intent  to communicate  at  the  time  of  communication;  thus  communication  can  occur  across  vast distances in time and space.   A2.1.2.  Intelligence.    The  plans,  operations,  systems,  and  management  activities  for accomplishing the collection, analysis, processing, and dissemination of intelligence in order to provide guidance and direction to commanders in support of their decisions. A2.1.3.  Security.   The  plans,  operations,  systems,  and  management  activities  for safeguarding  classified  resources  (not  peripheral  assets  and  support  functions  covered  by other  reporting  categories).    Also  covers  DoD  programs  for  protection  of  classified information.   A2.1.4.  Comptroller  and  Resource  Management.    Covers  the  budget  process,  finance  and accounting,  cost  analysis,  productivity  and  management  improvement,  and  the  general allocation and continuing evaluation of available resources to accomplish mission objectives.  Includes pay and  allowances for all DoD personnel  and all financial management areas not covered by other reporting categories, such financial reporting. A2.1.5.  Contract  Administration.    The  fulfillment  of  contractual  requirements  including performance  and  delivery,  quality  control  and  testing  to  meet  specifications,  performance acceptance,  billing  and  payment  controls,  justification  for  contractual  amendments,  and actions to protect the best interests of the government. A2.1.6.  Force  Readiness.    The  operational  readiness  capability  of  combat  and  combat support  (both  Active  and  Reserve)  forces  which  provide  the  necessary  flexibility  to  deter potential foes and rapidly respond to a broad spectrum of global threats.   A2.1.7.  Information Technology.  Any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment  that  is  used  in  the  automatic  acquisition,  storage,  manipulation,  management, movement,  control,  display,  switching,  interchange,  transmission,  or  reception  of  data  or information.    It  includes  computers,  ancillary  equipment,  software,  firmware  and  similar services  and  related  resources  whether  performed  by  in-house,  contractor,  or  other  intra-agency or intergovernmental agency resources or personnel.   A2.1.8.  Acquisition.    Acquisitions  including  major  acquisitions  and  items  designated  as major  systems  that  are  subject  to  the  procedures  of  the  Defense  Acquisition  Board,  the Military Services acquisition review councils, or the Selected Acquisition Reporting System.  The  Office  of  the  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Acquisition,  Technology,  and  Logistics Memorandum,  “Guidance  on  the  Assessment  of  Acquisition  Functions  under  Office  of Management  and  Budget,  Circular  No.  A-123,”  April  6,  2009  requires  the  use  of  an acquisition  assessment  template  when  conducting  internal  control  reviews  and  reporting AFI65-201  9 FEBRUARY 2016 35 material  weaknesses  for  this  category.    DoD  Directive  5000.1  may  be  helpful  when evaluating a weakness for inclusion in this category. A2.1.9.  Manufacturing,  Maintenance,  and  Repair.
