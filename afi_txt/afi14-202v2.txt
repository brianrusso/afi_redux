Purpose.  The objective of the AFI 14-202 series is to develop and maintain a high state of mission  readiness  for  effective  execution  of  AF  missions  supporting  the  full  range  of  military operations.    This  is  done  by  ensuring  all  personnel  performing  intelligence  duties  attain  and maintain the qualifications and currencies needed to support their unit's mission effectively and to the minimum standards prescribed by each community. 1.2.  Publication Structure and Hierarchy.  AFPD 14-2 mandates an intelligence qualification training  program,  standardization/evaluation  (Stan/Eval)  program  and  prescribing  of  general intelligence procedures and policies. 1.2.1.  AFI 14-202 prescribes the framework  for  unit intelligence programs  and procedures.  Specific  guidance  tailored  to  the  mission  set  or  mission  design  series  (MDS),  weapons system,  intelligence  function  or  activity  is  further  detailed  in  applicable  AFI  14-2 publications (hereafter referred to as “AFI 14-2[MDS]”).  The AFI 14-202 publications take precedence over mission set instructions (AFI 14-2[MDS]). 1.2.2.  The  volume  structure  is  consistent  across  the  AFI  series.    AFI  14-202,  Volume  1, Intelligence Training, structures the intelligence qualification training program with AFI 14-2[MDS]  detailing  specific  knowledge  and  performance  tasks  as  well  as  the  currencies required  for  qualification  within  each  mission  set.    AFI  14-202,  Volume  2,  Intelligence Standardization/Evaluation Program, structures the intelligence Stan/Eval program with AFI 14-2[MDS]  defining  specific  evaluation  standards  and  criteria  for  ensuring  standardized qualifications  within  each  mission  set.    AFI  14-202  Volume  3,  General  Intelligence  Rules along with AFI 14-2[MDS], addresses the mission of each unit intelligence function, identify the key processes, tasks and procedures the unit requires in order to accomplish its mission.  MAJCOMs  will  determine  the  applicability  of  these  publications  for  mission  sets  not otherwise specifically addressed by published guidance. 1.3.  Applicability. 1.3.1.  The AFI 14-202 publications apply to those personnel who perform intelligence duties supporting AF operational missions at the wing level and below (as defined in AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization).  These intelligence activities require clear  guidance and oversight to  ensure  the  proper  allocation  of  AF  resources  to  ensure  the  AF  is  ready  to  support Combatant Commander Objectives. 1.3.2.  This publication is not intended to apply to functions such as command staff, technical training  activities,  service  intelligence  production  centers,  or  acquisition  support  unless specifically  directed  by  AFI  14-2[MDS]  series  publications.    Nor  is  it  intended  to  apply  to mission sets already governed by other guidance such as non-14-series AFIs provided there is  clear and sufficient  guidance to  effectively direct  intelligence activities.  Commanders of these units may choose to  adopt  the processes contained in  AFI 14-202 for their personnel, but it is not required by this AFI series or AFPD 14-2.  MAJCOMs/FOAs will determine the applicability  of  these  publications  for  mission  sets  not  otherwise  specifically  addressed  by published guidance. AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015   5  1.4.  Scope.  This  volume  describes  execution  of  the  intelligence  Stan/Eval  program  specific  to qualification in a duty position within a unit. regarding 1.4.1.  Additional  guidance Intelligence  Community  qualifications  and certifications as directed by Department of Defense issuance may be further detailed in AFIs external  to  the  14-202/14-2[MDS]  series,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  requirement.    An example of this is AFI 14-126, Target Coordinate Mensuration Training, Qualification and Certification Program.  Training  and certification required by  regulations such as these  are supplemental  to  any  duty  position  qualifications  required  by  the  AFI  14-202  and  AFI14-2[MDS] series. 1.4.2.  Certification of core tasks of a specialty training standard (STS) may be accomplished concurrently with intelligence evaluations if all requirements for both are met. 1.4.3.  Qualifications  versus  Certifications.    Qualifications  are  attained  through  evaluations and  documented  on  the  AF  Form  4350,  Certificate  of  Intelligence  Qualification.  Certifications  are  attained  through  methods  other  than  evaluation  (e.g.  SIO/commander certifications,  designated  certifier,  etc.)  and  may  be  documented  by  a  memorandum  for record (MFR) signed by an authorized official.   6  AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Intelligence,  Surveillance  and  Reconnaissance  (ISR) (AF/A2).  AF/A2 delegates the following responsibilities to AF/A2DF.  AF/A2DF will: 2.1.1.  Develop  policy  guiding  the  conduct  and  execution  of  the  Intelligence  Stan/Eval Program. 2.1.2.  Review  and  monitor  AFI  14-2[MDS]  volumes  and  MAJCOM  intelligence  Stan/Eval policies, guidance and supplements for consistency with AFI 14-202 and for standardization across intelligence mission sets. 2.1.3.  Designate a lead command for each intelligence mission set. 2.1.4.  Coordinate  T-1  compliance  waivers  with  lead  commands  to  ensure  awareness  of Stan/Eval  issues  faced  by  other  MAJCOMs  in  order  to  make  informed  programmatic decisions. 2.2.  Lead  Command.  Lead  commands  are  responsible  for  compiling  requirements  and ensuring  consistency  across  the  mission  set.    Lead  commands  will  act  in  coordination  with  all affected MAJCOMs.  Unresolved differences between MAJCOMs will be elevated to AF/A2DF for  final  resolution.    The  term  “lead  command”  does  not  refer  to  a  particular  organizational echelon  (i.e.,  may  be  a  MAJCOM,  Field  Operating  Agency  (FOA),  Center  of  Excellence, Bureau, etc.).  In addition to their MAJCOM responsibilities, lead commands will: 2.2.1.  Author  and  manage  AFI  14-2[MDS]  that  defines  Stan/Eval  requirements  for  each mission set.  AFI 14-2[MDS] may be more, but not less, restrictive than this publication. 2.2.2.  Address  Stan/Eval  issues  within  each  intelligence  mission  set  community  to  ensure currency  and  applicability  of  Stan/Eval  guidance.    Sponsor  unit-level  'best  practices' exchanges to help address Stan/Eval issues (e.g. web sites). 2.2.3.  Periodically  review  Intelligence  Stan/Eval  policies  and  procedures  in  coordination with affected MAJCOMs. 2.2.4.  Review  MAJCOM  waivers  to  identify  trends  and  determine  any  programmatic changes.  Notify AF/A2DF if these trends indicate the need to readdress existing policy. 2.3.  MAJCOM  Directors  of  Intelligence  (A2).  The  role  of  the  MAJCOM  Intelligence Stan/Eval  function is  to provide guidance, ensure units have lead command-validated materials as  well  as  any  standardized  MAJCOM  materials  needed,  and  assist  units  in  conducting  their Stan/Eval  programs.    NGB/A2  has  these  responsibilities  and  is  included  as  part  of  the  general title MAJCOM for this publication.  The MAJCOM Intelligence Stan/Eval function will: 2.3.1.  Designate  an  OPR  for  the  administration  of  the  MAJCOM’s  Intelligence  Stan/Eval function.  The OPR should remain within the intelligence directorate and can be executed by one  or  more  designated  staff  offices/divisions.    The  OPR  ideally  should  be  manned  by experienced  Intelligence  Evaluators  (IE).    There  is  no  requirement  for  personnel  to gain/maintain evaluator  qualification and currency  nor to  have manning  with  IE  experience in every MDS within the MAJCOM. AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015   7  2.3.2.  Coordinate  with  lead  commands  to  establish  and  maintain  standardized  minimum Stan/Eval  requirements and supporting Stan/Eval  materials  necessary to  meet  expected unit requirements. 2.3.3.  Provide guidance for units without published AFI 14-2[MDS] series to develop local Stan/Eval program consistent with the AFI 14-202 framework. 2.3.4.  Analyze  staff  assistance  visit,  inspector  general  reports,  unit  trend  analysis  reports, and other unit metrics to identify trends and problem areas.  Correct deficiencies as required, and report status of unit Stan/Eval programs to lead command, as requested. 2.3.5.  Track subordinate unit waiver  requests  and coordinate  with  lead  commands to  allow programmatic adjustments. 2.4.  Unit  Senior  Intelligence  Officer.  The  SIO  is  defined  as  the  Airman  responsible  for intelligence  functions  and  operations  within  an  organization.    Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the Wing  Commander,  this  is  the  highest-ranking  AF  Airman  within  the  organization  that  has:    1) been awarded an AF intelligence Specialty Code or civilian occupational series and 2) is serving in an AF intelligence position.  This position is synonymous with the Chief of Wing Intelligence (CWI),  where  applicable.    Installations  with  intelligence  activities  in  different  chains  of command have separate SIOs, each responsible for the intelligence functions and operations (or activities)  of  their  units,  accountable  to  their  commander  and  inspectable  by  their  respective MAJCOM Inspector General.  The unit SIO will: 2.4.1.  Establish and maintain a Stan/Eval  program.    If no AFI14-2[MDS] exists, develop  a local  Stan/Eval  program  consistent  with  the  AFI  14-202  framework  and  capture  in  local written guidance.   (T-1) 2.4.2.  Ensure  intelligence  evaluations  and  examinations  are  conducted  and  managed  using the evaluation criteria in the applicable AFI 14-2[MDS].  (T-1) 2.4.3.  Ensure evaluation records are completed.  (T-1) 2.4.4.  Ensure trends are identified, tracked, and corrective actions applied.  (T-2) 2.4.5.

For  units/organizations  with more  than  one  type  of  aircraft/mission,  combine  common  discrepancies  to  address  trends.  (T-2) 2.5.4.  Ensure evaluation records are forwarded to gaining unit when individuals Permanent Change of Station /Assignment (PCS/PCA) to assist gaining unit in assessing qualifications and determining training requirements.  (T-1)   8  AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015 2.6.  Intelligence  Evaluator.  The IE will conduct evaluations as required, using the evaluation criteria  in  the  applicable  AFI  14-2[MDS]  and  support  unit  Intelligence  Stan/Eval  functions  as outlined in Chapter 3 of this publication.  (T-1) AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015   9  Chapter 3 UNIT INTELLIGENCE STANDARDIZATION/EVALUATION PROGRAM 3.1.  General.  Intelligence  Stan/Eval  ensures  personnel  performing  intelligence  functions  can perform  their  duties  to  minimum  acceptable  standards  by  observing  them  in  performance  of those  duties.    The  Stan/Eval  program  also  provides  honest  feedback  to  enable  personnel  to improve their individual performance.  Stan/Eval provides feedback into training programs since trends observed among several individuals can highlight deficiencies in training.  It also ensures personnel  do  not  put  themselves  or  others  at  risk  by  performing  duties  for  which  they  are  not qualified.  More specifically, the Stan/Eval program: 3.1.1.  Ensures standardization of procedures for intelligence operations. 3.1.2.  Ensures  compliance  with  appropriate  operational,  training  and  administrative directives. 3.1.3.  Provides  a  system  to  assess  and  document  individual  proficiency  and  capability  to accomplish assigned intelligence duties. 3.1.4.  Recognizes trends in training and performance in order to identify improvement areas in training programs, standard operating procedures, and directives. 3.2.  Organization.  The  composition  of  the  unit  Stan/Eval  function  is  at  the  SIO’s  discretion with the following considerations: 3.2.1.  The  unit  intelligence  Stan/Eval  program  manager  will  be  a  qualified  and  current  IE.  (T-1) 3.2.2.  The number of IEs should be proportionate to the organization’s scope and number of assigned personnel. 3.2.3.  In a multi-MDS wing/unit, not all Stan/Eval personnel are required to be qualified in every MDS provided each MDS is represented by at least one qualified individual.  (T-2) 3.2.4.  Personnel may perform Stan/Eval duties full-time, as an additional duty, or mixture of both as appropriate to meet mission needs. 3.3.  Intelligence  evaluations.  The  following  applies  to  the  conduct  of  all  unit  intelligence mission qualification and specialized training evaluations. 3.3.1.  Evaluation  Cycle.    Periodic  evaluations  will  be  conducted  on  a  24-month  cycle  (or more  frequently  as  mandated  by  applicable  AFI  14-2[MDS]).    (T-1)    For  a  standard evaluation  cycle,  evaluations  expire  on  the  last  day  of  the  24th  month  after  which  the evaluation  was  successfully  completed.    The  individual  enters  the  evaluation  eligibility window  18  months  after  the  previous  evaluation  (6-month  period  prior  to  expiration  date).  Extensions may be granted by the SIO. 3.3.2.  Evaluations should be accomplished in a realistic training environment in conjunction with  in-garrison  events  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.    Evaluations  during  exercises  are encouraged.    Units  should  apply  operational  risk  management  principles  to  determine whether it is appropriate to conduct an evaluation during real-world operations.   10  AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015 3.3.3.  Grading instructions.  IEs will be thoroughly familiar with and will use the prescribed evaluation  criteria  IAW AFI 14-2[MDS] to  assign an appropriate evaluation grade for each area or sub-area IAW with the documentation instructions in this publication.   (T-1)  Based on  a  composite  of  these  individual  area/sub-area  grades,  the  IE  determines  the  overall qualification level. 3.3.4.  IEs  will  conduct  thorough  pre-event  preparation  and  post-event  debriefing  with  the examinee to provide feedback that allows the individual to improve performance.  (T-3)  The IE will also prepare participants (e.g. aircrew role-playing a debrief or other intelligence crew positions  providing  information  to  the  examinee)  to  ensure  objectives  of  the  evaluation  are met.  (T-3) 3.3.5.  IEs  should  promptly  notify  the  examinee’s  supervisor  whenever  unsatisfactory performance is observed. 3.3.6.  The person responsible for the majority of an individual’s qualification training should not  perform  the  initial  qualification  evaluation  for  that  same  individual  unless  manning constraints make this impossible.  If this occurs, the SIO will document the necessity of this in the individual’s qualification record.   (T-3)  Recurring evaluations may be performed by any qualified IE. 3.4.  Trend  Analysis.  Stan/Eval  trend  analysis  aids  the  SIO  in  reviewing  and  resolving  issues for the unit as well as subordinate and attached units, as applicable.  Additionally, data compiled across  multiple  units  allows  MAJCOMs  to  determine  any  systemic  problem  areas  or programmatic issues. 3.4.1.  Trend  analysis  data  should  include  unit  evaluation  and  examination  results,  waivers and  extensions,  trends  and  status,  Stan/Eval  manning  issues  and  other  requirements  as identified by MAJCOMs. 3.4.2.  Trend reporting will be conducted at least annually but frequency and timing may be determined by MAJCOM data calls or reporting requirements.  (T-2) AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015   11  Chapter 4 EVALUATIONS 4.1.  Evaluation  Categories.  Intelligence  qualification  evaluations  are  divided  into  three categories, each typically consisting of two structured phases (knowledge and task) requiring the completion of requisite events.  The knowledge phase includes a series of written (and/or oral, if applicable)  examinations.    The  task  phase  includes  a  hands-on  evaluation  of  intelligence  task performance. 4.1.1.  Mission  (MSN)  Evaluations.    MSN  evaluations  ensure  the  individual’s  ability  to support  full  mission  planning  and  employment  in  accomplishing  the  unit’s  operational mission.    All  intelligence  personnel  assigned  to  a  position  maintaining  Combat  Mission Ready  (CMR)  or  Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC)  status  (IAW  AFI  14-202,  Volume  1)  will complete an initial MSN evaluation (INIT MSN) and periodic MSN evaluations as specified in the applicable AFI 14-2[MDS].  (T-1) 4.1.2.  Specialized  Qualification  Evaluations.    All  intelligence  personnel  maintaining specialized qualifications must complete initial and periodic evaluations of their specialized qualifications at least every 24 months or more frequently if directed in their respective AFI 14-2[MDS].  (T-1) 4.1.3.  SPOT  Evaluations.    A  SPOT  evaluation  is  used  to  evaluate  a  specific  event  or requirement without intending to satisfy the requirements of a complete periodic evaluation.  SPOT  evaluations  are  optional  and  have  no  specific  requisites  or  requirements,  unless specified in supplementary guidance.  SPOT evaluations may consist of a knowledge and/or task phase. 4.1.4.  Intelligence Evaluation Prefixes.  The following prefixes are used, as applicable: 4.1.4.1.  Initial  (INIT)  Prefix.    The  first  evaluation  of  any  type  for  a  position  or specialized qualification is assigned the “INIT” prefix (e.g., INIT MSN, INIT EIT). 4.1.4.2.  Requalification (RQ) Prefix.  An evaluation administered to requalify due to an expired evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months, a failed periodic evaluation, or loss of qualification due to SIO-directed downgrade.  Document the AF Form 4350 Event Check description with an RQ prefix. 4.1.4.2.1.  When  loss  of  qualification  is  due  to  expiration  of  a  required  periodic evaluation,  the  evaluation  given  will  be  IAW  the  guidance  for  that  periodic evaluation.  (T-1) 4.1.4.2.2.  When loss of qualification is due to loss of currency, the evaluation profile will be as directed by the SIO and will include, as a minimum, those items for which the individual is non-current for over 6 months.  (T-2) 4.1.4.2.3.  If loss of qualification is due to failure to pass an evaluation, only use RQ prefix on evaluations other than initial (INIT) evaluation.  If an  INIT evaluation, no qualification was previously achieved, thus requalification is not possible. 4.1.4.2.4.  When  loss  of  qualification  is  due  to  an  SIO-directed  downgrade,  the  SIO determines the appropriate evaluation profile.   12  AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015 4.1.4.3.  No-Notice (N/N) Prefix.  An evaluation is considered N/N when the examinee is notified  of  the  evaluation  only  once  normal  preparation  for  an  event  has  begun.    The evaluator determines the beginning of the preparation period; this may be defined further by the unit. 4.1.4.3.1.  A  small  percentage  of  evaluations  should  be  given  out-of-cycle  and without  the  opportunity  for  the  examinee  to  perform  any  extraordinary  preparation.  The N/N evaluation program provides SIOs and supervisors a tool to assess the actual mission readiness of their personnel and assess unit training effectiveness. 4.1.4.3.2.  If  an  examinee  successfully  completes  an  N/N  evaluation  that  covers  all requirements  of  a  normal  periodic  evaluation  (e.g.  N/N  MSN),  the  examinee’s  next periodic evaluation due date should be updated so the next evaluation will not be due until 24 months after the N/N evaluation unless specified sooner in AFI 14-2[MDS]. 4.1.5.  Combined  Evaluations.    To  promote  efficient  use  of  resources,  evaluations  may  be combined.    Include  the  designation  of  each  evaluation  on  the  AF  Form  4350  -  e.g., MSN/EIT.  The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined evaluations should be explained under Task Description in the Evaluator’s Remarks. 4.2.  Timing of Qualification Evaluations. 4.2.1.  Expiration  Date.    Required  periodic  evaluations  expire  on  the  last  day  of  the  24th month  after  the  evaluation  was  successfully  completed.    Lead  commands  may  require periodic  evaluations  more  frequently  than  24  months  as  directed  in  the  applicable  AFI  14-2[MDS]. 4.2.2.  Scheduling.    Schedule  periodic  evaluations  in  the  eligibility  period  (6-month  period prior to expiration date). 4.2.3.  SIO-Extended  Evaluations.    SIOs  may  extend  the  expiration  date  of  periodic evaluations up to  3 months for the reasons  listed below.  Document such extensions  with a Memo for Record placed in the individual’s evaluation record. 4.2.3.1.  Extended  Temporary  Duty  (TDY)  over  90  days  such  as  a  deployment  which precludes performing the evaluation during the normal 6-month eligibility window. 4.2.3.2.  Individual departing PCS/PCA, separating, or retiring from the service. 4.2.4.  Transfers.    Upon  PCS  to  a  like  mission  set,  individuals  qualified  in  a  crew  position may retain current qualifications provided requirements in AFI 14-202, Volume 1, are met. 4.3.  Evaluation  Criteria  Source.  Each  AFI  14-2[MDS]  establishes  standardized  evaluation criteria.    In  the  absence  of  an  AFI  14-2[MDS]  series,  the  SIO  will  ensure  local  guidance  is established for evaluation criteria.  (T-2) 4.4.  Grading System.  The grading system used to evaluate and document performance consists of two distinct parts:  individual area/subarea grades and overall qualification levels. 4.4.1.  Area/Subarea Grades.  Areas to be evaluated are identified as gradesheet elements in the AFI14-2[MDS] for documentation on the AF4381.  The grading criteria is defined in the AFI 14-2[MDS]. AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015   13  4.4.1.1.  Certain  areas  or  subareas  may  be  designated  “critical  areas”  because  failure  to follow  the  strict  requirements  of  instructions,  regulations,  or  procedures  could  cause mission failure or injury.  Critical areas, if applicable, are noted in the AFI 14-2[MDS]. 4.4.1.2.  Individual areas are graded with a 3-level system (Q, Q- or U), except for critical areas which are pass/fail (Q or U) only. 4.4.1.2.1.  Qualified  (Q).    Q  is  the  desired  level  of  performance.    The  examinee demonstrated  a  satisfactory  knowledge  of  all  required  information,  performed intelligence  duties  within  the  prescribed  tolerances  and  accomplished  the  assigned mission. 4.4.1.2.2.  Qualified  with  discrepancies  (Q-).    Q-  indicates  the  examinee  is  qualified to  perform  the  assigned  area  tasks,  but  requires  debriefing  or  additional  training  as determined by the evaluator. 4.4.1.2.3.  Unqualified  (U).    Assign  a  U  area  grade  for  any  performance  outside allowable  parameters  or  deviations  from  prescribed  procedures/tolerances  that adversely  affected  mission  accomplishment  or  compromised  safety/security.    An examinee  receiving  an  area  grade  of  U  normally  requires  additional  training.  However,  if  the  evaluator  is  able  to  correct  the  issue  with  verbal  feedback  and believes  the  examinee  will  be  able  to  perform  acceptably  in  their  next  evaluation, additional training may not be required. 4.4.1.3.  The overall area grade (Q/Q-/U) cannot be higher than the lowest of any subarea grade awarded. 4.4.2.  Overall  Qualification  Levels.    Qualification  levels  are  represented  by  a  three-tiered system  (Q1,  Q2,  Q3).    The  overall  qualification  level  awarded  is  based  on  performance during  both  the  knowledge  and  task  phases.    Qualification  level  is  determined  as  a cumulative score based on the area/subarea grades.  The evaluator administering the majority of the evaluation is responsible for deciding the overall qualification grade and annotating the AF4350. 4.4.2.1.  Qualification Level 1 (Q1).  The member demonstrated desired performance and knowledge  of  procedures,  equipment  and  directives  within  tolerances  specified  in  the grading criteria.  This is awarded when no discrepancies were noted and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:  the discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any  area(s)/subarea(s);  in  the  judgment  of  the  evaluator,  none  of  the  discrepancies preclude awarding an overall Q1; and all discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the debrief of that evaluation. 4.4.2.2.  Qualification  Level  2  (Q2).    The  member  demonstrated  the  ability  to  perform duties,  but:    there  were  one  or  more  area(s)/subarea(s)  where  additional  training  was assigned; or a non-critical area(s)/subarea(s) grade of U was awarded; or in the judgment of  the  evaluator,  there  is  justification  based  on  performance  in  one  or  several areas/subareas. 4.4.2.3.  Qualification Level 3 (Q3).  The member demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety,  security,  performance,  or  knowledge.  An  overall  Q3  can  be  awarded  if,  in  the judgment  of  the  evaluator,  there  is  justification  based  on  performance  in  one  or  several   14  AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015 areas/subareas.  An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall Q3 for the evaluation.  An overall grade of Q3 can be awarded at any time during the evaluation but  completing  the  evaluation  may  allow  assessment  of  other  areas  which  may  need additional training. 4.4.3.  Remedial Action.  All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy  the discrepancy.  Remedial  action  includes  debriefing  the  discrepancies,  and/or  assignment  of  additional training, and/or imposing of restrictions. 4.4.3.1.  Debriefed  Discrepancy.    Remedial  action  accomplished  during  debrief  of  the evaluation wherein the evaluator provides briefing/instruction concerning the discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to remedy  the  discrepancy.    The  discrepancy  area/subarea  description  is  annotated  with “Debriefed”  in  paragraph  B  of  the  Evaluator’s  Remarks  section  of  the  AF  Form  4350 comments (see Attachment 2). 4.4.3.2.  Additional  Training.    Any  training  recommended  by  an  evaluator  to  remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.  Additional training: 4.4.3.2.1.  May  include  self-study,  instruction,  use  of  a  computer  based  training program  or  an  event.    Once  additional  training  is  complete,  the  examinee  must demonstrate satisfactory knowledge or proficiency.  (T-2) 4.4.3.2.2.  Will  be  completed  within  30  days  or  two  Unit  Training  Assemblies (UTAs)  for  Air  Force  Reserve  (AFR)  and  ANG.    For  reevaluations,  adjust  the expiration date of the current qualification to allow for remedial training.  (T-2) 4.4.3.2.3.  Should be documented in the AF Form 4350 comments under paragraph C, Recommended  Additional  Training,  under  Evaluator’s  Remarks.   Include  a description of how satisfactory knowledge or proficiency is to be demonstrated to an evaluator,  supervisor  or  instructor.    Due  dates  and  completion  dates  for  additional training  are  documented  in  the  appropriate  areas  of  the  AF  Form  4350  (see Attachment 2). 4.5.  Failure to Pass an Evaluation. 4.5.1.  Recheck Evaluation.  If an individual fails an evaluation, a recheck evaluation must be completed no later than 60 days after the evaluation was conducted (or four UTAs for AFR and ANG).  (T-2)  SIOs may approve waivers to the time limits up to an additional 30 days (or one additional UTA for AFR/ANG) on a case-by-case basis.  Document such action with an MFR. 4.5.2.  Status  Downgrade.    Downgrade  members  receiving  a  Q-3  on  a  MSN  evaluation  to non-CMR  (N-CMR)  or  non-BMC  (N-BMC),  as  applicable.    For  specialized  qualification evaluations,  the  status  (i.e.,  CMR  or  BMC)  does  not  need  to  be  downgraded  if  the discrepancies were only in specialized qualification areas. 4.5.3.  Restrictions.    When  called  for  by  this  publication  or  deemed  necessary  in  the judgment of the evaluator and/or supervisor, the examinee will not perform applicable duties while  unsupervised  until  successful  completion  of  assigned  additional  training  and/or  a recheck.  (T-2) AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015   15  4.5.3.1.  Document  restrictions  on  the  AF  Form  4350  and  address  the  specific  task  or event that requires supervision until successful retraining is completed.  Restrictions are not punitive, but designed to enhance performance and proficiency. 4.5.3.2.  Restrict  individuals  receiving  a  Q-3  on  an  evaluation,  as  listed  below,  until  a successful recheck evaluation is completed. 4.5.3.2.1.  MSN  Evaluation.    The  examinee  may  perform  basic  qualification  tasks unless  specifically  restricted.    Place  the  examinee  on  supervised  status  for  mission tasks. 4.5.3.2.2.  Specialized  Qualification  Evaluation. receiving  an unsatisfactory  grade  in  any  specialized  area(s)  will  not  perform  specialized  duties until a successful recheck is complete.  (T-2)   Examinees 4.6.  Supervised  Status.  If  unsatisfactory  performance  requires  the  member  to  be  placed  on supervised status, the SIO determines the type of supervision. 4.7.  Evaluation Timeline.  Some evaluations may be relatively simple and can be finished in a matter  of  hours.    Others  are  more  complex  and  may  require  multiple  sessions  to  evaluate  all required items.  Evaluations should last no more than 5 duty days. 4.8.  Evaluator  Requirements.  Evaluators will be qualified and current  in the mission set and crew  position  they  evaluate.    (T-2)    However,  when  this  is  not  feasible,  an  evaluator  from  a similar MDS or crew position may perform an evaluation. If determined acceptable by the lead command.   16  AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015 Chapter 5 INTELLIGENCE EXAMINATIONS 5.1.  Intelligence Examinations.  Intelligence examinations measure an individual’s knowledge of  procedures,  threats  and  other  information  essential  for  effective  intelligence  operations.  Knowledge  requisites  for  periodic  intelligence  qualification  evaluations  includes  a  series  of examinations  as  listed  in  the  applicable  AFI  14-2[MDS].    Poor  testing  performance  on examinations can often indicate areas requiring increased training emphasis. 5.2.  Master Question File (MQF).  The MQF is a set of applicable questions designed to meet the  needs  of  various  unit-level  intelligence  examinations.    Lead  commands  are  responsible  for ensuring that an applicable MQF is produced to support each mission set and that the MQF and related source materials are accessible to all examinees. 5.3.  Administrative  Procedures.  Units  will  develop  unit  specific  examination  policies  and procedures.  (T-2) 5.3.1.  Intelligence  Stan/Eval  functions  will  develop  and  maintain  positive  control  of  all examination materials (i.e. tests, answer sheets, and associated electronic media).  (T-2) 5.3.2.  Unit  Intelligence  Stan/Eval  will  maintain  a  minimum  of  two  tests  on  file  for  each mission set/crew position and ensure that no more than 50% of the questions are duplicated between tests.  (T-2) 5.3.3.  Units  using  computer-generated  examinations  do  not  need examinations referenced above provided the following restrictions are observed: to  maintain the 5.3.3.1.  Individual examinations are randomly generated from the MQF. 5.3.3.2.  Re-examinations  are  constructed  so  that  duplication  of  questions  is  kept  to  a minimum. 5.3.4.  Change 50 percent of the questions on the requisite examinations every calendar year. 5.3.5.  Grade examinations as a percentage of correct answers. 5.3.6.  Retention  of  Examination  Records.    Retain  graded  exam  answer  sheets/computer records until the AF Form 4350 is completed and signed by member. 5.3.7.  Examination  Question  Review.    Stan/Eval  should  review  all  MQFs  and  prepared exams for accuracy annually and after any changes in source documents. 5.3.8.  Grading  Policy.    Minimum  Passing  Grade.    The  minimum  passing  grade  for examinations is 85 percent, unless otherwise noted in applicable AFI 14-2[MDS]. 5.3.9.  Failure  to  Pass.    An  evaluation  is  not  complete  until  all  required  exams  have  been passed. 5.3.9.1.  Reexamination Policy.  An individual failing a required exam should be afforded an  adequate  study  period  prior  to  reexamination.    Test  the  individual  using  an  alternate exam. 5.3.9.2.  Reexamination  Period.    Individuals  who  fail  a  required  test  must  complete  a reexamination within 30 days (AFR/ANG:  Four UTAs) following the date of the failure.  AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015   17  (T-2)    Waiver  authority  to  extend  the  time  allowed  to  successfully  complete  the examination is the SIO.  Document such waivers with a Memo for Record placed in the qualification evaluation record of the individual. 5.3.9.3.  Supervised  Status  Requirement.    Stan/Eval  will  place  individuals  who  fail  a requisite  knowledge  examination  in  supervised  status  until  successful  retesting  is completed and notify the individual’s supervisor and the SIO of this action.   (T-2)  For individuals who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status resulting from failure of a knowledge type examination applies only to the MDS, weapons system, function or activity for which the examination was administered. 5.3.10.  If  an  individual  is  qualified  in  more  than  one  duty  position  or  holds  a  specialized qualification in  addition  to  a baseline qualification and both  qualifications require the same test, there is no requirement to take the test more than once provided the test is taken in the eligibility period for both qualifications.   18  AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015 Chapter 6 EVALUATION RECORDS 6.1.  General.  Evaluation results are recorded and verify that an individual is qualified for his or her  duty  position.    In  addition  to  the  record  of  individual  evaluation  results,  a  chronological history  of  evaluations  is  also  recorded  to  have  a  summary  report  of  qualifications  of  the individual.    Evaluation  records  are  to  be  maintained  throughout  an  individual’s  service  and transfer  with  the  individual  to  each  assignment.    All  intelligence  personnel  supporting  the operational mission of the unit/organization are to have an evaluation record, which includes all AF Forms 4350, applicable MFR, and additional lead command/MAJCOM specified items. 6.2.  Documentation. 6.2.1.  Intelligence Gradesheet (AF Form 4381).  The IE will use a hardcopy AF Form 4381 containing  the  MDS-specific  task  elements  from  the  gradesheet  attachment  in  AFI  14-2[MDS]  to  assist  in  grading  the  individual  areas  during  the  evaluation  and  taking  notes  to ensure all required areas are evaluated.   (T-2)  Do not use the gradesheet completed on the individual  during  MQT/ST.    After  documenting  any  discrepancies  noted  during  the evaluation  on  the  AF  Form  4350,  the  IE  may  destroy  the  hardcopy  AF  Forms  4381  used during  the  evaluation.    Do  not  destroy  AF  Forms  4381  completed  during  qualification  or specialized training.  An electronically-derived evaluation gradesheet may be used in lieu of the actual AF Form 4381. 6.2.2.  Certificate  of  Intelligence  Qualification  (AF  Form  4350).    The  overall  evaluation result is recorded on the AF Form 4350 which becomes the source document to verify that an individual  is  qualified  for  his  or  her  duty  position.    Any  applicable  MFRs  should  be maintained along with the AF Form 4350s.  As source documents, AF Forms 4350 may be corrected provided the IE who signed the AF Form 4350 verifies the change. 6.2.3.  Record  of  Intelligence  Evaluation  (AF  Form  4349).    An  individual’s  chronological history  of  evaluations  is  recorded  on  the  AF  Form  4349.    A  complete  history  of  the  AF Forms  4350 in  a member’s record is  maintained  on their AF  Form  4349.   AF  Forms  4349, not  being source documents, may be altered without  restriction  to  reflect the assignment of the affected member and the contents of AF Form 4350 Section. 6.2.4.  On-line  Documentation.    Documentation  will  be  IAW  AF/A2  approved  processes.  (T-2) 6.3.  Review  of  Qualification  Evaluation  Records.  The  unit  will  review  the  records  for  all newly assigned intelligence personnel to identify previous training and qualifications.  (T-2)  The reviewing  organization  is  responsible  for  establishing  the  currency  and  qualification  of  the intelligence  specialist  as  determined  from  the  latest  applicable  documentation.    Following determination of the currency and qualification of the intelligence specialist, the unit maintaining the record is responsible only for documentation subsequently placed in the record. 6.4.  Disposition  of  Qualification  Evaluation  Record.  Outdated  material  and  miscellaneous documentation identified during reviews is to be returned to the member for disposal. 6.5.  Transfer  of  Evaluation  Record.  When custody of the record is transferred to a new unit or base, the losing unit is to ensure the record is successfully transferred to the gaining unit either AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015   19  electronically or in hardcopy as required.  For personnel going into inactive status or not serving with an AF intelligence operational mission, the losing unit surrenders the qualification record to the individual to maintain.   20  AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015 Chapter 7 SPECIALIZED QUALIFICATIONS 7.1.  IE  Qualification.  An  individual  is  considered  qualified  to  perform  IE  duties  upon completion of the IE ST profiles, successful IE evaluation, and endorsement by the SIO. 7.1.1.

An IE receiving a grade of “U” in any grading area must not perform IE duties until completing additional training and a successful evaluation.  (T-2)  This restriction is placed in the Comments section and “yes” is marked in restrictions on the AF Form 4350.  An area grade of “U” in any grading area results in an overall Q-3 for the IE evaluation.  Evaluation grading is covered in Chapter 5. 7.1.2.  IE  Currency.    In  order  to  maintain  qualification,  IEs  must  conduct  at  least  one evaluation  annually  to  remain  current  and  be  evaluated  via  periodic  IE  evaluations  at  least every 24 months.  (T-1) 7.2.  External  Intelligence  Training  (EIT)  Trainer  Evaluation.  Mission  sets  requiring qualified EITs will evaluate their EITs according to a common standard of instructional ability.  (T-2) 7.2.1.  EIT  evaluations  consist  of  a  knowledge  examination  and  a  performance  task evaluation.  Upon completion of EIT training profiles outlined in AFI 14-202, Volume 1 and any  additional  profiles  specific  to  the  mission  set  as  detailed  in  AFI  14-2[MDS],  the  EIT trainer will demonstrate knowledge of the information presented by successfully completing AFI14-202V2  31 MARCH 2015   21  a test based on the questions from the MQF (85 percent minimum to pass), as applicable.  (T-2)  Evaluation will also gauge the EIT trainer’s ability to present training in each applicable profile. 7.2.2.  EIT evaluations may be conducted in conjunction with a MSN evaluation. 7.2.3.  EIT Evaluation Criteria.  All EITs will be evaluated to at least the following criteria.  (T-1)  Additional criteria may be defined in the applicable AFI 14-2[MDS]. Table 7.2.
