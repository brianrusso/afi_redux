Coordinate  requests  through  the  BCE  with  the  Base  Civil  Engineer Environmental  Function  to  obtain  AFCEC/CZO  approval  before  mixing  and  burning waste fuel and lubricants with heating fuel. Biodiesel fuel and biodiesel blends exceeding B5 (5% biodiesel) will not be burned in boilers.  (T-2). 3.4.  Process  Steam.  Where possible, supply process steam which wastes condensate (such as steam cleaning) from dedicated boilers. 3.5.  Heating and Distribution Systems and Unfired Pressure Vessels (UPV).  BCEs must ensure  design  and  construction  of  steam  boilers,  hot  water  generators,  heating  and distribution systems, UPVs, and pressure piping systems comply with the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code or equivalent host nation requirements and this instruction. (T-0).  The code requires the design of all steam and hot water heating systems must include equipment to  provide  industrial  water  treatment  (see  AFI  32-1054,  Corrosion  Control).  Boilers  and UPVs must have a pressure-relieving device as required by the ASME  Boiler and Pressure Vessel  Code,  which  requires  all  steam  pressure-reducing  valve  stations  on  the  low-pressure side  to  have  a  correctly  rated  and  sized  pressure-relief  device  and  compressed  air  receivers less than 1.5 ft3 must have the manufacturer’s standard pressure-relieving device.  BCEs shall ensure  all  pressure  vessels  in  which  moisture  can  accumulate  must  have  automatic condensate drainage.  (T-1). 3.5.1.  Operating  Boilers  and  Hot  Water  Generators.  Safe  operation  of  boilers  and  hot water  generators  require  qualified  operating  technicians  to  be  on  hand  to  detect  and correctly  respond  to  equipment  malfunctions  or  irregularities  that  could  disrupt  service, cause a hazard, or damage equipment. 3.5.1.1.  Attendance.  Table  3.1  shows  the  minimum  frequency  for  technicians  to attend  (check  and  adjust  control  settings  during  operation)  boilers  and  hot  water generators, based on heating plant capacity (combination of all units used to produce heat  that  is  transmitted  through  distribution  system  to  a  building  or  group  of buildings) and operating pressure and is applicable to all type of fuel sources.  Unless host  nation  agreements  or  standards  require  more  frequent  visits,  operating technicians must attend assigned boilers per the minimums shown in Table 3.1 (T1). Variances  to  Table  3.1  prior  to  1  June  2016  must  have  been  be  approved  by MAJCOM and variances after that date must be routed through appropriate AFIMSC channels  for  approval.  (T-1).  Requests  for  variances  must  include  a  complete description of the boiler system, control technology, proposed operating procedures, and frequency of attendance. (T-1). 3.5.1.2.  High  Pressure  Steam,  Medium  and  High  Temperature  Water  Plants.  Plants that  produce  high  pressure  steam  (HPS),  greater  than  15  psig;  MTW,  30-160  psig (250–350 °F); and HTW at greater than 160 psig; must have technicians present that are fully qualified for the operation of the particular system and should be licensed to meet environmental regulatory agency requirements. (T-1). 8 AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 3.5.1.3.  Remote  Monitoring.  Remote  monitoring  is  defined  as  a  condition  where boiler  controls  and  safeties  are  automated  and  continuously  monitored  by  a  system-trained technician from a remote location, with the capability for safe shutdown of all units.  The  remote  location  requires  the  following  capabilities:  ability  to  monitor network  failure  alarms,  ability  to  view  water  level  (steam)/water  pressure  and temperature  (MTW  and  HTW),  stack  temperature,  feedwater  flow  (steam)/make-up flow (MTW and HTW), steam flow/circulation flow (MTW and HTW), fuel flow at burner,  and  video  camera  installed  to  view  boiler/hot  water  generator  front.  Use  of proper remote monitoring may be used to support a request for variance to attendance requirements. It is recommended all steam boilers operating at or above 15 psig or hot water generators operating at or above 30 psig which are not required to be constantly attended,  be  remotely  monitored.  Per  NFPA  85,  Boiler  and  Combustion  Systems Hazards Code, remote monitoring must not override (prevent) any boiler or hot water generator safety shutdown. (T-0). Table 3.1.

(T2). 3.5.3.1.  Pressure  Vessel  Welding.  The  ASME  Boiler  and  Pressure  Vessel  Code, Section  IX,  “Welding  and  Brazing  Qualifications,”  contains  welding  procedural specifications and welder qualification requirements. BCE will not allow welding or brazing of pressure components of steam-jacketed cooking equipment or UPV. (T-0). Owning organization must replace failed parts. (T-0). 3.5.3.2.  Distribution Systems. Perform maintenance according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and appropriate repair codes. 3.5.3.2.1.  Existing  Systems.  Operations  Flight  will  at  least  annually  check  the system leaks using thermograph technology or other approved testing methods as recommended by the manufacturer in addition to checking for damage and loss of 10 AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 insulation.    (T-2).    Repair  damaged  lines  as  necessary  to  maintain  insulating qualities. 3.5.3.2.2.  Failed  Distribution  Lines.  Make  temporary  repairs  to  failed  lines  as soon as conditions permit. BCE will program the replacement of failed sections as soon as the extent of failure is known.  (T-2). 3.5.3.2.3.  Temporary  Repairs.  Temporary  repairs  to  direct  buried  systems  using piping other than prefabricated conduit systems are permitted. Limit these repairs to 500 feet per repair.  BCE will replace these repairs within 18 months with an approved  system  and  materials.  (T-2).  Repair  material  must  be  suitable  for  use under  the  pressure  and  temperature  conditions  of  the  distribution  system  being repaired. 3.5.3.2.4.  Cathodic  Protection  Systems.    Where  cathodic  protection  is  installed, Operations Flight will inspect, test, and maintain distribution lines in accordance with AFI 32-1054 and Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-570-06, Operation and Maintenance: Cathodic Protection Systems.  (T-2). 3.5.4.  Replacing  or  Installing  New  Distribution  Lines.    Before  replacing  failed  lines  or installing new lines, select a route and then a system type. 3.5.4.1.  Route  Selection.  The  system  route  should  be  coordinated  with  the  facility master plan. The selected route has considerable impact on system type selection. For example, aboveground systems usually are not acceptable if they create obstructions to  traffic  or  are  unsightly,  while  large  numbers  of  obstructions  along  the  system profile greatly increase the cost of underground systems. Attention should be given to any  severe  or  complex  installation  conditions  that  adversely  affect  the  cost  of  the system. The final route selected should minimize the system life-cycle cost. 3.5.4.2.  System Type Selection. BCE will evaluate potential heat distribution system types  according  to  the  following  order  of  preference:  (1)  aboveground;  (2)  shallow concrete  trench;  (3)  direct  buried  prefabricated  conduit;  (4)  poured-in-place underground insulation system.  (T-2). Select the most cost-effective system based on the  results  of  a  life-  cycle  cost  analysis.    (T-1).  Calculate  heat  loss  for  each  system under  consideration  by  using  standard  American  Society  of  Heating,  Refrigerating and  Air  Conditioning  Engineers  (ASHRAE)  methods.    (T-2).  Evaluate  life-cycle costs  of  the  alternatives  by  using  the  Building  Life-Cycle  Cost  Program  (BLCC) available at the Federal Energy Management Program web site.  (T-2). 3.5.4.3.  System  Design  and  Construction  of  New  or  Replacement  Distribution Systems.  BCE will design and construct new and replacement distribution systems to meet  the  requirements  of  UFC  3-430-01FA  and  applicable  Unified  Facilities  Guide Specifications (UFGS). (T-1).  UFCs and UFGS are available at the Whole Building Design Guide (www.wbdg.org). 3.5.4.4.  Installation of Repair Sections. When not otherwise designed, CE will install and test new system  components per the UFGS, manufacturer’s requirements, or by other approved methods. Complete all tests and correct deficiencies prior to insulating or  covering  connections,  joints,  welds,  or  fittings.  (T-1).    An  authorized  factory representative is recommended during installation and testing of systems. AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 11 3.5.5.  Inspections and Testing. 3.5.5.1.

Inspectors  will  promptly  notify  the  BCE,  base  safety  office,  and  AFIMSC Detachment  when  a  boiler  or  pressure  vessel  is  unsafe  to  operate.  (T-2).    The AFIMSC Detachment may issue separate reporting instructions.  BCE must post one copy of the inspection report (under a transparent protective cover) in a conspicuous location  near  the  boiler  or  pressure  vessel,  send  one  copy  to  the  operations  flight; place one copy in the file. (T-1). 3.5.5.6.  Post-Inspection Repairs. Before leaving the base the inspector will report any serious  defects  to  the  operations  flight.  Take  corrective  actions  requested  by  the inspector or listed on the inspection reports. If a boiler or pressure vessel is unsafe to operate, proper repairs must be made before placing it on-line. (T-0).    All repairs to pressure  components  of  boilers  or  UPVs  and  safety  pressure-relief  devices  must  be performed  by  an  organization  holding  the  appropriate  NBIC  code  stamp  and  in accordance with ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. (T-0). 3.5.5.7.  Reporting Repairs. After inspecting the repairs (reference A2.2.4), BCE will post one copy of the inspection report describing repair actions (under a transparent protective cover with the original inspection report); send one copy to the operations flight; place one copy in the file. (T-1). 3.5.5.8.  Boiler Tune-ups and Energy Assessments. 3.5.5.8.1.  Environmental  Regulatory  Requirements.  Tune-ups  are  routinely required for all operational boilers depending on the boiler’s input capacity, fuel type,  and  the  facility’s  HAP  classification  (e.g.,  Major  or  Area  Source).    Many existing  boilers  are  also  required  to  undergo  a  one-time  energy  assessment. Energy  assessments  identify  energy  conservation  measures  to  reduce  heating system  energy  demand.  The  Major  Source  and  Area  Source  tune-up  and  energy assessment  requirements  are  listed  in  40  CFR  Part  63,  Subpart  JJJJJJ  (Area Source) and Subpart DDDDD (Major Source) and summarized in Attachment 3.  14 AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 The  minimum  tune-up  requirement  is  trimming  (adjusting)  the  combustion  air within  the  limits  prescribed  by  the  manufacturer  and  per  the  requirements  as outlined in Tables A3.1 through A3.4.  If automatic trim controls are not installed, a  portable  flue  gas  analyzer  may  be  used.    Follow  the  sampling  procedures prescribed  in  ASME  Code  PTC  19.10-1981,  Flue  and  Exhaust  Gas  Analyses, Appendix  4.  Include  all  other  manufacturer-identified  maintenance  actions  that are  due  or  recommended  to  be  performed  on  an  annual  basis.  Per  40  CFR, documentation  of  energy  assessment  and  tune-ups  must  be  maintained  at  base-level  civil  engineer  unit.  (T-0).  For  further  guidance,  refer  to  Attachment  3, “Implementation of Major and Area Source Rules as Applied to Boiler Tune-ups and  Energy  Assessments  for  the  Boiler  National  Emission  Standards  for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) Rules.” 3.5.5.8.2.  Non-Environmental  Requirements.  All  other  boilers  exempt  from  the environmental  requirements  above,  regardless  of  size  or  fuel  type,  must  be trimmed  (adjusting  combustion  air  within the manufacturer and per the requirements as outlined in Tables A4.1 through A4.4.) and  receive  all  manufacturer-identified  recommended  maintenance  actions annually.  (T-1).  Follow the sampling procedures prescribed in ASME Code PTC 19.10-1981,  Flue  and  Exhaust  Gas  Analyses,  Appendix  4  with  a  calibrated portable  flue  gas  analyzer  to  determine  combustion  efficiency.    No  combustion analysis is required if an oxygen trim system is installed on a boiler limits  prescribed  by the   All  boilers  must  be  operated  within 3.5.5.9.  Combustion  Efficiency. the manufacturer’s specified range for excess combustion air (or excess O2). (T-1). This ensures that boilers operate within a narrow range of optimal combustion efficiencies.  Attachment 4, “Tuning Boilers for Maximum Efficiency,” lists combustion efficiency tables that can be used to identify the expected combustion efficiencies for natural gas and oil-fired boilers operating within various operating parameters. 3.5.6.  Boiler  Replacement.    Boilers  should  be  replaced  at  the  end  of  their  useful  life.  This  condition  is  met  when  it  is  not  possible  to  restore  the  boiler  to  a  safe,  operating condition and/or when it is no longer economical to operate versus the life cycle cost of a new  boiler.    To  determine  whether  or  not  a  boiler  has  met  or  exceeded  its  useful economic life, a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) per the methodology outlined in 10 CFR 436 is required. 3.6.  Organizational  Equipment,  Mobile  Boiler,  and  Privately  or  Contractor-Owned  located  on  Air  Force  installations  must  be  operated  safely  and  comply  with  the provisions  of  paragraph  3.5  through  paragraph  3.5.5.9.  to  comply  with  40  CFR.    The  unit owning  organization  or  contract  quality  assurance  evaluator  (QAE)  must  monitor  these boilers and UPVs to ensure the operator/owner will: 3.6.1.  Comply  with  basic  safety  practices  similar  to  those  required  for  government boilers and UPVs.  (T-1). 3.6.2.  Arrange for periodic safety inspections.  (T-1). 3.6.3.  Schedule  an  authorized  inspection  agency  to  perform  inspections  at  the  same intervals required for government boilers and UPVs.  (T-1). AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 15 3.6.4.  Post  inspection  reports  as  specified  for  government-operated  boilers  and  UPVs. (T1).  Note:  Per  NBIC,  the  equipment  owner  must:  (1)  Make  repairs  that  the  inspector recommends; (2) pay for all inspections and repairs; and (3) not operate equipment before repairing it if the inspector declares it unsafe.  (T-0-). Repair equipment according to the NBIC or host country code, as applicable.  (T-0).  TIMOTHY S.

Heavy  liquid—Includes  residual  oil  and  any  other  liquid  fuel  not  classified  as  a  light  liquid (residual oils such as #4, #5 & #6 oil). High Pressure Steam—high pressure steam operates at system pressures greater than 15 psig. 22 AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 High  Temperature  Water—high  temperature  water  operates  at  system  pressures  greater  than 160 psig. Hot Water Heater—A closed vessel with a capacity of no more than 120 U.S. gallons in which water is heated by combustion of fuel and hot water is withdrawn for use external to the vessel. Hot water boilers (i.e., boilers not generating steam) with a heat input capacity of less than 1.6 million  Btu  per  hour  are  included  in  this  definition  (Note:  The  120  gallon  capacity  threshold does not apply to hot water boilers.) Hot water heater also means a tankless unit that provides on-demand hot water. Light Liquid—Includes distillate oil, biodiesel, or vegetable oil. Distillate oil refers to fuel oils that contain 0.05 weight percent nitrogen or less and comply with the specifications for fuel oil numbers 1 and 2 (distillate oil such as #1, #2 oil, biodiesel, vegetable oils). Limited-use  Boiler/Process  Heater—Any  boiler  (and  process  heater  for  a  Major  Source)  that burns  any  amount  of  solid,  liquid,  or  gaseous  fuels  and  has  a  federally  enforceable  average annual  capacity  factor  of  no  more  than  10  percent.    The  annual  capacity  factor  is  the  ratio between  the  actual  heat  input  to  a  boiler  or  process  heater  from  the  fuels  burned  during  a calendar year and the potential heat input to the boiler or process heater had it been operated for 8,760 hours during a year at the maximum steady state design heat input capacity. Low  Pressure  Boiler—a boiler in which steam or vapor is generated at a pressure less than or equal to 15 psig. Low Temperature Water—low temperature water operates system pressures below 30 psig and temperatures below 250 °F. Major Source—Any contiguous area under common control (such as an Air Force installation) that emits or has the potential to emit, considering controls, in the aggregate, 10 tons per year or more  of  any  single  HAP  or  25  tons  per  year  or  more  of  any  combination  of  HAPs,  unless  the EPA administrator establishes a lesser quantity, or, in the case of radionuclides, different criteria from those specified in this paragraph. Medium Temperature Water—medium temperature water operates system pressures between 30 and 60 psig and temperatures in excess of 250 °F. New  Boiler/Process  Heater—A  boiler  (and  process  heater  for  a  Major  Source)  is  new  if construction  or  reconstruction  of  the  boiler  or  process  heater  began  after  4  June  2010  and  the boiler or process heater meets the applicability criteria at the time construction commenced. Oxygen  Trim System—A system of monitors that is used to maintain excess air at the desired level  in  a  combustion  device.  A  typical  system  consists  of  a  flue  gas  oxygen  and/or  carbon monoxide monitor that automatically provides a feedback signal to the combustion air controller. Period of gas curtailment or supply interruption—A period of time during which the supply of gaseous fuel to an affected boiler is restricted or halted for reasons beyond the control of the facility.  The  act  of  entering  into  a  contractual  agreement  with  a  supplier  of  natural  gas established  for  curtailment  purposes  does  not  constitute  a  reason  that  is  under  the  control  of  a facility for the purposes of this definition. An increase in the cost or unit price of natural gas due to  normal  market  fluctuations  not  during  periods  of  supplier  delivery  restriction  does  not constitute a period of natural gas curtailment or supply interruption. On-site gaseous fuel system AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 23 emergencies or equipment failures qualify as periods of supply interruption when the emergency or failure is beyond the control of the facility. Process  Heater—An  enclosed  device  using  a  controlled  flame  with  a  primary  purpose  of transferring  heat  indirectly  to  a  process  material  (liquid,  gas,  or  solid)  or  to  a  heat  transfer material  (e.g.,  glycol  or  a  mixture  of  glycol  and  water)  for  use  in  a  process  unit,  instead  of generating steam. Reconstructed Boiler/Process Heater—The boiler (and process heater for a Major Source) is a reconstructed  source  if  reconstruction  of  the  boiler  or  process  heater  commenced  after  4  June 2010, and met the applicability criteria at the time reconstruction commenced.  Reconstruction is the replacement of components such that the total, fixed capital cost of the replacement is greater than 50% or more than the fixed capital cost of constructing a comparable, new unit. Residential Boiler—A boiler used to provide heat and/or hot water and/or as part of a residential combined  heat  and  power  system.    This  definition  includes  a  boiler  located  at  an  institutional facility  (e.g.,  military  base)  or  commercial/industrial  facility  if  the  boiler  is  used  primarily  to provide  heat  and/or  hot  water  for:    (1)  a  dwelling  containing  four  or  fewer  families;  or  (2)  a single unit residence dwelling that has since been converted or subdivided into condominiums or apartments. Responsible Official—The Installation/Center Commander as defined by 40 CFR 70.2 and AFI 32-7040,  Air  Quality  Compliance  and  Resource  Management;  this  individual  must  sign  Initial Notice of Compliance Status reports. Seasonal  Boiler—A  boiler  that  undergoes  a  shutdown  for  a  period  of  at  least  seven  (7) consecutive  months  (or  210  consecutive  days)  each  twelve-month  period  due  to  seasonal conditions,  except  for  periodic  testing.    Periodic  testing  must  not  exceed  a  combined  total  of fifteen (15) days during the seven-month shutdown.  This definition applies only to boilers that would otherwise be included in  the biomass  subcategory or the oil subcategory under the Area Source rule. Temporary  Boiler  or  Process  Heater—Include any gaseous or liquid fuel boiler (and process heater  for  a  Major  Source)  that  is  designed  to,  and  is  capable  of,  being  carried  or  moved  from one  location  to  another  (for  example  by  wheels,  skids,  carrying  handles,  dollies,  trailers,  or platforms).  A boiler or process heater is NOT a temporary if any one of the following conditions exists: (1)  The equipment is attached to a foundation. (2)  The boiler or a replacement remains at a location within the facility and performs the same or similar function for more than 12 consecutive months, unless the appropriate regulatory authority grants an extension. Any temporary boiler that replaces a temporary boiler at a location and performs the same or similar function will be included in calculating the consecutive time period. (3)  The equipment is located at a seasonal facility and operates during the full annual operating period of the seasonal facility, remains at the facility for at least 2 years, and operates at that facility for at least 3 months each year. (4)  The equipment is moved from one location to another in an attempt to circumvent the residence time requirements of this definition. 24 AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 Tune-up—Adjustments made to a boiler (and process heater for a Major Source) in accordance with  the  procedures  outlined  in  40  CFR  63.11223  (for  Area  Sources)  or  40  CFR  63.7540  (for Major Sources).  AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 25 Attachment 2 INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS A2.1.

Purpose.  This  attachment  provides  guidance  to  AFIMSC  Detachments,  Base  Civil Engineer, Air Force boiler owners/operators, and Air Force Environmental Management offices for meeting the regulatory requirements for boiler tune-ups and energy assessments of U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 63 (40 CFR Part 63), Subparts DDDDD and JJJJJJ.  It is the  responsibility  of  the  Base  Civil  Engineer  and  the  owners/operators  of  Air  Force  boilers  to become familiar with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 63 as it pertains to their boiler systems. For further reference and details on tune-ups and energy assessments, the AFCEC/CZTQ Air Quality Subject  Matter  Expert  provides  a  boiler  NESHAP  guide  for  Area  Sources  and  a  boiler  (and process heater) guide for Major Sources as comprehensive guidance for compliance with 40 CFR 63 Subpart JJJJJJ and Subpart DDDDD. A3.2.  Point of Contact.  Recommendations for improvements to this guidance are encouraged.  Refer  recommended  changes  and  questions  regarding  this  AFI  to  the  Air  Force  Air  Quality Subject Matter Expert at AFCEC/CZTQ, 2261 Hughes Avenue Suite 155, JBSA-Lackland AFB, Texas, e-mail: afcec.cztq.workflow@us.af.mil,  using  AF  Form  847;  route  AF  Forms  847  from  the  field through the appropriate functional chain of command. 78236-9853,  DSN 925-3237, 945-3237, Commercial (210) A3.3.  Background.  The EPA published NESHAP for boilers for both Area and Major Sources on March 21, 2011. Subsequently, the EPA published amendments to the Major Source rule on January 31, 2013 and November 20, 2015, and amendments to the Area Source rule on February 1, 2013.  Proposed amendments to the Area Source Rule were published in January 2015 which remains  pending  finalization.  The  regulations  set  requirements  including  tune-ups  and  energy assessments. This attachment provides guidance only on meeting the regulatory requirements for tune-ups and energy assessments. A3.4.  Exemptions. A3.4.1.  Both  the  Area  Source  rule  and  the  Major  Source  rule  list  specific  types  of  units which are exempt from  all requirements of the rule. Exemptions from the Area Source rule are identified in 40 CFR 63.11195 and exemptions from the Major Source rule are identified in 40 CFR 63.7491. Key exemptions include the following: A3.4.1.1.  Any  boiler  specifically  listed  as,  or  included  in  the  definition  of,  an  affected source in another standard(s) under 40 CFR 63. A3.4.1.2.  A unit that burns hazardous waste covered by 40 CFR 63, Subpart EEE. A3.4.1.3.  An  electric  utility  steam  generating  unit  (EGU)  covered  by  40  CFR  63, Subpart UUUUU. A3.4.1.4.  Any  boiler  specifically  listed  as  an  affected  source  in  any  standard(s) established under Section 129 of the CAA (Solid Waste Combustion). 30 AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 A3.4.1.5.  A boiler that is used specifically for research and development. This exemption does not include boilers that solely or primarily provide steam (or heat) to a process or for heating at a research and development facility. A3.4.1.6.  Any  boiler  that  is  used  as  a  control  device  to  comply  with  another  subpart under  40  CFR  Parts  60,  61,  63,  or  65,  provided  that  at  least  50  percent  of  the  average annual  heat  input  is  provided  by  regulated  gas  streams  that  are  subject  to  another standard. A3.4.1.7.  Temporary boilers:  See Attachment 1 for definition. A3.4.1.8.  Hot water heaters:  See Attachment 1 for definition. A3.4.1.9.  Residential boilers:  See Attachment 1 for definition. A3.4.2.  The following additional units are also exempt specifically under the Major Source rule: A3.4.2.1.  A recovery boiler or furnace covered by 40 CFR 63, Subpart MM. A3.4.2.2.  A refining kettle covered by 40 CFR 63, Subpart X. A3.4.2.3.  An ethylene cracking furnace covered by 40 CFR 63, Subpart YY. A3.4.2.4.

Blast  furnace  gas  fuel-fired  boilers  and  process  heaters:  See  Attachment  1for definition. A3.4.3.  The  following  additional  units  are  exempt  specifically  under  the  Area  Source  rule only: A3.4.3.1.  Electric boilers:  See Attachment 1 for definition. A3.4.3.2.  Gas-fired boilers:  See Attachment 1 for definition. A3.5.  Requirements.  40  CFR  Part  63  stipulates  operational  requirements  for  boiler  (and process heater for a Major Source) tune-ups and energy assessments for Area Source and Major Source  boilers.  A  boiler  tune-up  optimizes  the  air-fuel  mixture  for  the  operating  range  of  the boiler  which  improves  combustion  and  reduces  emissions  of  HAPs.    Conducting  an  energy assessment  of  the  boiler  and  boiler  system  identifies  opportunities  to  improve  operational efficiencies which may also result in reduction of HAP emissions. The first step is to determine the  source  type  for  the  facility  in  regards  to  HAP  emissions:  Area  Source  or  Major  Source. Check  with  the  base  Environmental  Management  office  to  confirm  the  facility’s  source  type. Note: The facility’s source type designation (Area Source or Major Source) can be different for different  pollutants;  therefore,  be  sure  to  obtain  the  source  type  designation  that  specifically pertains to HAP emissions. A3.5.1.  Area and Major Source Definitions Applicable to the Boiler NESHAP Rules. A3.5.1.1.  Area Source:  See Attachment 1for definition. A3.5.1.2.  Major Source:  See Attachment 1for definition.   AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 31 A3.5.2.  Tune-ups.  Boiler (and process heater for a Major Source) tune-ups are required for Area  Source  and  Major  Source  boilers  according  to  40  CFR  Part  63,  Subparts  JJJJJJ  and DDDDD.

Existing boilers (and process  heater for a Major Source) (see definitions, Attachment 1, “Existing Boiler/Process Heater”) must have  an  initial  tune-up  on  or  before  the  compliance  dates  as  stated  in  40  CFR  63, Subpart  JJJJJJ  and  Subpart  DDDDD.    New  and  reconstructed  boilers  (and  process heater  for  a  Major  Source)  (see  definitions,  Attachment  1,  “New  Boiler/Process Heater”  and  “Reconstructed  Boiler/Process  Heater”)  are  not  required  to  have  an initial tune-up, but they must comply with their first tune-up no later than 13 months (if  subject  to  annual  tune-ups),  25  months  (if  subject  to  biennial  tune-ups),  or  61 months (if subject to pentennial tune-ups) after start-up, whichever is applicable. (T-0). A3.5.2.2.2.  .    Subsequent  Tune-Up  Schedule.    Tune-ups  must  be  conducted according to the schedule stated in 40 CFR 63, Subpart JJJJJJ and Subpart DDDDD. (T-0). The tune-up schedule is summarized in Table A3.2. A3.5.2.2.3.  Early Tune-up  .  A tune-up may be conducted early as long as the tune-up  included  all  elements  of  the  tune-up  specified  in  40  CFR  63,  Subpart  JJJJJJ  or Subpart DDDDD.  If the initial tune-up for an existing boiler was completed prior to the compliance date, the next tune-up will be due no later than 13 months, 25 months, or 72 months from when the initial tune-up was conducted, as applicable.  (T-0). A3.5.2.2.4.  Boiler/Process  Heater  Not  In  Operation  on  Compliance  Date.  If the boiler (or process heater for a Major Source) is not operating on the required date for a tune-up (because it is a seasonal boiler, or because it is down for maintenance, for example), the tune-up must be conducted within 30 days of startup.  (T-0). A3.5.2.2.5.  Burner  Inspection.  Burner  inspections  may  be  performed  before  the tune-up  or  delayed  until  the  next  scheduled  shutdown  (scheduled  or  unscheduled shutdown  for  Major  Source  boilers  or  process  heaters  subject  to  a  pentennial  tune-up);  however,  the  inspection  delay  may  not  exceed  36  months  from  the  previous 32 AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 inspection for boilers/process heaters subject to biennial tune-ups and 72 months from the  previous  inspection  for  boilers/process  heaters  subject  to  pentennial  tune-ups.   (T-0). A3.5.2.2.6.  Boilers or Process Heaters Located at a Major Source Where Entry Into a Piece of Process Equipment or Into a Storage Vessel Is Required.  Tune-up inspections are required only during planned entries into the storage vessel or process equipment. Remaining tune-up requirements must be met according to the applicable tune-up schedule for the unit. (T-0). A3.5.2.3.  Tune-up  Notification  and  Reporting  Deadlines.  Notification  and  reporting of  tune-up  applicability  and  completion  must  be  conducted  per  the  requirements  in  40 CFR 63 Subpart JJJJJJ (Area Source) and Subpart DDDDD (Major Source). (T-0). Tune-up notification and reporting due dates and deadlines are summarized in Table A3.3.  For boilers  (and  process  heaters  for  a  Major  Source)  subject  to  an  initial  tune-up,  a  signed statement indicating an initial tune-up was conducted must be included in the Notification of  Compliance  Status  (NOC).    For  Area  Sources,  first  tune-ups  for  new  boilers  and subsequent  tune-ups  for  all  boilers  are  reported  and  certified  as  completed  in  the Compliance Certification Report which is prepared by March 1st on an annual, biennial, or pentennial basis, as applicable.   For Major Sources, first tune-ups for new boilers and subsequent  tune-ups  for  all  boilers  are  reported  and  certified  as  completed  in  the  semi-annual Compliance Report (postmarked or submitted no later than July 31 or January 31, as  applicable)  or  the  annual,  biennial,  or  pentennial  Compliance  Report  (postmarked  or submitted  no  later  than  January  31,  as  applicable).    If  it  is  determined  that  a  tune-up compliance deadline passed, immediately contact the AFCEC/CZTQ Air Quality Subject Matter Expert for a consult on developing a compliance strategy. A3.5.2.4.  Overview of Tune-up Requirements.  Tune-up requirements are summarized in  Table  A3.4  for  Area  Source  and  Major  Source  tune-ups.  The  tune-up  must  be conducted while burning the type of fuel  (or  fuels in  case of units that routinely burn  a mixture) that provided the majority of the heat input to the boiler or process heater over the  12  months  prior  to  the  tune-up.  See  referenced  sections  of  40  CFR  Part  63  Subpart JJJJJJ or Subpart DDDDD for complete requirements and details.  (T-0). Table A3.1.  Tune-up Applicability and Frequency.

A3.5.3.  Energy  Assessments.  Energy  assessments  are  a  one-time  requirement  for  existing Area  Source  and  Major  Source  boilers  according  to  40  CFR  Part  63,  Subpart  JJJJJJ  and Subpart DDDDD.  The Area Source and Major Source energy assessment requirements are summarized in  Table A3.5 through Table A3.9.  See referenced sections of 40 CFR Part 63 for complete requirements and details. A3.5.3.1.  Purpose  of  Energy  Assessment.  The  energy  assessment’s  purpose  is  to identify  energy  conservation  measures  (e.g.,  process  changes  or  other  modifications  to the facility) that can be implemented to reduce system and facility energy demand which AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 35 would  reduce  fuel  use  and  emissions.    Note:  the  EPA  does  not  require  that  the  facility implement energy conservation measures identified by the assessment. A3.5.3.2.  Energy Assessment Applicability.  Energy assessments are required for both Area  Sources  and  Major  Sources.    Energy  assessment  applicability  is  summarized  in Table A3.5. A3.5.3.2.1.  Area  Sources.  Assessments  are  required  for  existing  boilers  only  (not process heaters), ≥10 MMBtu/hr in size, using coal/oil/biomass fuel (not gas). This is a one-time requirement.  Exception:  Energy assessments are not required for existing limited-use boilers. A3.5.3.2.2.  Major  Sources.  Assessments  are required only  for  existing  boilers and process heaters of any size, using any fuel (coal/oil/biogas/gas 1 or gas 2). This is a one-time requirement.  Exception:  Energy assessments are not required for existing limited-use boilers. A3.5.3.3.  Compliance  Dates  for  Energy  Assessments.  Compliance  deadlines  are summarized in  Table A3.6.  Energy  assessment notification and reporting due dates are summarized in Table A3.7. A3.5.3.4.  Prior  Assessments.  Energy  assessments  completed  on  or  after  1  January 2008,  that  include  the  criteria  of  Table  2  to  Subpart  JJJJJJ  and  Table  3  to  Subpart DDDDD  of  40  CFR  Part  63  can  be  used  to  satisfy  the  energy  assessment  requirement.  Energy  assessor  approval  and  qualification  requirements  are  waived  in  instances  where past or amended energy assessments are used. Per 40 CFR, the Base Civil Engineer will determine if the prior assessment meets the criteria before submitting to the EPA. (T-0).  If part of the requirements conducted under the prior assessment is lacking, the remaining tasks can be completed and then submitted along with the previous assessment. Table A3.5.

Table A3.8.  Energy Assessment Requirements.   ENERGY ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS AREA SOURCE  (Boilers Only) MAJOR SOURCE  (Boilers and Process Heaters) Rule Reference Table 2 to Subpart JJJJJJ (40 CFR 63) Table 3 to Subpart DDDDD (40 CFR 63) General Energy Assessment Requirements A one-time energy assessment must be performed by a qualified energy assessor (see definition in Attachment 1). An energy assessment completed on or after 1 January 2008, that meets or is amended to meet the energy assessment requirements in this table, satisfies the energy assessment requirement.  A facility that operated under an energy management program developed according to the ENERGY STAR guidelines for energy management or compatible with ISO 50001 for at least one year between 1 January 2008 and the compliance date that includes the affected units also satisfies the energy assessment requirement. The energy assessment must meet the extent of the evaluation appropriate for the on-site technical hours. 1. A visual inspection of the boiler system. 2. An evaluation of operating characteristics of the facility, specifications of energy-using systems, operating and maintenance procedures, and unusual operating constraints. 3. Inventory of major systems consuming energy from affected boiler(s). 4. A review of available architectural and engineering plans, facility operation and maintenance procedures and logs, and fuel usage. 5. A list of major energy conservation measures. 6.  Not included for Area Sources 6. A review of the facility’s energy management practices and provide recommendations for improvements consistent with the definition of energy management practices. 7. A list of the energy savings potential of the identified energy conservation measures. 8. A comprehensive report detailing the ways to improve efficiency, the cost of specific improvements, benefits, date of assessment, and the time frame for recouping those investments.    AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 37 Table A3.9.  Scope and Duration of Energy Assessment.  SCOPE AND DURATION OF ENERGY ASSESSMENT AREA SOURCE (Boilers Only) MAJOR SOURCE (Boilers and Process Heaters) Rule Reference  §63.11237 §63.7575 Combined heat input capacity  < 0.3 TBtu/yr Combined heat input capacity of 0.3 to 1 TBtu/yr Combined heat input capacity > 1 TBtu/yr  1. Energy assessment for facilities with affected boilers using less than 0.3 trillion Btu (TBtu) per year heat input will be 8 hours onsite technical labor hours in length maximum*. The boiler (or process system(s) for a Major Source), process heater(s), and any on-site energy use system(s)** accounting for at least 50 percent of the affected unit(s) energy (e.g., steam, hot water, process heat, or electricity) production, as applicable, will be evaluated to identify energy savings opportunities, within the limit of performing an 8-hour on-site energy assessment. (See Attachment 1 for definition.) 2. Energy assessment for facilities with affected boilers and process heaters using 0.3 to 1 TBtu/year will be 24 hours onsite technical labor hours in length maximum*. The boiler (or process system(s) for a Major Source), process heater(s), and any on-site energy use system(s)** accounting for at least 33 percent of the affected unit(s) energy (e.g., steam, hot water, process heat, or electricity) production, as applicable, will be evaluated to identify energy savings opportunities, within the limit of performing an 8-hour on-site energy assessment. (See Attachment 1 for definition.) 3. Energy assessment for facilities with affected boilers and process heaters using greater than 1.0 TBtu/year will be 24 hours onsite technical labor hours in length maximum, plus 8 hours for each additional 1.0 TBtu/yr (not to exceed 160 hours).*  The boiler (or process system(s) for a Major Source), process heater(s), and any on-site energy use system(s)** accounting for at least 20 percent of the affected unit(s) energy (e.g., steam, hot water, process heat, or electricity) production, as applicable, will be evaluated to identify energy savings opportunities, within the limit of performing an 8-hour on-site energy assessment. (See Attachment 1 for definition.) *At the discretion of the facility, the duration of the energy assessment can exceed the maximum number of onsite technical labor hours. **The on-site energy use systems serving as the basis for the percent of affected boiler(s) (and process heater(s) for a Major Source) energy production may be segmented by production area or energy use area as most logical and applicable to the specific facility being assessed (e.g., product X manufacturing area; product Y drying area; Building Z). IMPORTANT! - CLARIFICATIONS ABOUT SCOPE AND DURATION The heat input cut-off values apply to the combined heat input of all the affected boilers (and process heaters, if a major source facility). For example, if there are 10 boilers at the facility and they are individually less than 0.3 TBtu/yr but their combined heat input is greater than 1 TBtu/yr, then the facility would be considered to be in the > 1 TBtu/yr category to determine the duration and scope of the energy assessment.  The energy assessment must include all of the affected boiler systems (see definition in Attachment 1). For example, if you have 10 affected boilers in your facility then you will likely have to assess ten boiler systems.  The requirement is that the energy assessment must include, in addition to the affected boiler system, some percent of the systems using the energy from the affected boilers. That percent will be 50, 33, or 20 percent, depending on the heat input category identified for the facility. For example, if the facility is in the > 1 TBtu/yr heat input category, and there is one boiler that serves ten buildings, then the energy assessment should include the boiler system and any of the ten buildings that would be using at least 33% of the energy from that boiler system. If none of the buildings are using at least 33% of the energy, then only the boiler system would be included in the energy assessment.  A3.5.4.  Notification,  Reporting,  and  Recordkeeping  Requirements.  40  CFR  Part  63, Subpart  JJJJJJ  and  Subpart  DDDDD  includes  notification,  reporting,  and  recordkeeping requirements for both Area Source and Major Source boilers.

The following combustion efficiency tables can be used to tune natural gas and oil-fired, condensing and non-condensing, steam  and hot  water boilers.  Note:    Area and Major Source  boiler  tune-up  procedures  are  described  in  40  CFR  63.11223(b)  and  40  CFR 63.7540(a)(10), respectively.  The tables are divided by fuel type, high heating value (HHV) of the fuel, and by outside ambient temperature.  These parameters vary between typical limits and should  reasonably  reflect  actual  field  conditions  at  various  times  of  the  year.    All  tables  are calibrated for standard sea level pressure (14.696 psia).  These tables are for reference use only, as it is difficult to capture all variables affecting a boiler’s operating combustion efficiency (e.g., fuel  impurities,  burner  condition,  firing  rate).    However,  the  tables  do  provide  accurate  trend information. A4.2.  Combustion Efficiency Parameters  .  Measured parameters required to use these tables are listed in paragraphs A4.2.1 through A4.2.5.  Extrapolating table data outside these ranges is not advised; using the tables at pressure altitudes exceeding 1500 feet above sea level is also not recommended. A4.2.1.  Boiler type (condensing or non-condensing). A4.2.2.  High heating value (HHV) of the fuel. A4.2.2.1.  980 – 1080 Btu/ft3 for natural gas. A4.2.2.2.  131,500 – 139,600 Btu/gal for fuel oil. A4.2.3.  Flue stack temperature between 90 and 640 °F. A4.2.4.  Excess O2 between 0 and 15% (or a corresponding excess air percentage). A4.2.5.  Outside ambient temperature between 20 and 40 °F. A4.3.  Measuring Combustion Efficiency Using Tables  . A4.3.1.  First,  determine  the  HHV  for  the  fuel  you  are  using.    This  information  is  usually indicated on the utility or fuel purchase invoice.  If not, contact your utility supplier for this information,  or  use  the  intermediate  table  value  (1,030  Btu/ft3  for  natural  gas;  135,500 Btu/gal for #2 fuel oil). A4.3.2.  Second,  determine  the  ambient  air  temperature.    This  is  the  temperature  of  the  air entering  the  boiler.    Outside  air  temperature  may  be  used  if  the  internal  boiler/mechanical room heat gains are small. A4.3.3.  Third,  determine  if  the  boiler  is  a  condensing  or  non-condensing  boiler.    This information should be clearly indicated in the manufacturer’s O&M manual. A4.3.4.  Next,  using  a  calibrated  portable  combustion  analyzer,    measure  and  record  the temperature and O2 concentrations in the flue duct.  Use the sampling procedures described in  ASME  Code  PTC  19.10-1981,  Section  3.    Use  a  minimum  of  eight  sampling  points  to ensure the velocity is uniform in each area of the duct. 42 AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 A4.3.5.  Finally, calculate and record the temperature difference between the flue gas and the ambient  temperature (ΔT).  Using the information  previously  gathered, find the appropriate combustion efficiency values from the table(s).  Interpolation between values is permissible. A4.4.  Adjusting  Combustion  Air  Trim.  The combustion air should  always be set  within the range specified by the manufacturer.  If the range is specified in terms of excess O2, then use the flue gas readings from the combustion analyzer.  If the range is specified in terms of excess air, then use the tables to cross-reference the excess air value based on the excess O2 reading. A4.4.1.  Outside Air Temperature.  Air temperature is inversely proportional to air density.  As the outside air temperature decreases, the air density increases.  For boiler systems using fixed  combustion  air  intakes  (such  as  venturi  air  intakes),  increased  air  density  causes  the excess air rate to increase (decreasing combustion efficiency).  A temperature swing of ±50 °F can cause a fluctuation of up to 35% in excess air.  To mitigate this effect, the combustion air  should  be  adjusted  to  the  minimum  excess  air  limit  at  the  corresponding  highest operational outside air temperatures.  For example, consider a boiler with a fixed venturi air intake and a manufacturer’s recommended excess air range of 20–60%.  Assuming the boiler is expected to be firing at outside air temperatures from 0–50 °F, the venturi air intake should be  set  for  minimum  excess  air  (20%)  while  the  outside  air  temperature  is  at  or  near  a maximum (50 °F).  This procedure assures that the boiler will still fire inside the appropriate range  when  the  outside  air  temperature  is  0  °F.    Boilers  using  automatic  combustion  air control  regulators  (i.e.,  excess  O2  flue  gas  sensors)  are  not  affected  by  outside  air temperature. A.4.2.2.    Flue  Stack  Temperature.    Flue  gas  (or  stack)  temperatures  are  driven  by  the temperature  of  the  boiler  supply  water  (or  steam)  and  the  efficiency  of  the  heat  transfer  across the  boiler’s  internal  heat  exchanger  (i.e.,  tube  bundle).    Flue  stack  temperatures  are  always greater than the water/steam supply temperature due to heat losses.  To increase boiler efficiency, the  supply  temperature  should  be  set  to  the  lowest  temperature  that  will  satisfy  the  load.    Flue stack temperatures that rise over time (while the supply set point remains constant) may indicate fouling of the internal heat exchanger or tube bundle.  In this case, the boiler should be scheduled for shutdown and heat exchanger cleaning.   AFI32-1068  8 FEBRUARY 2017 43 A4.5.
