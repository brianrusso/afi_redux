Crew should stand clear of dolly set during lowering operation.  5.5.11.6.   Adapter  arms  must  remain  vertical  until  contact  is  made  with  the  ground.    If adapter arms are tilted, the sides are not being lowered at the same rate.  5.5.11.7.   Pushing the safety pins from the strut assemblies using the fingers should not be attempted  under  any  circumstances  at  the  fingers  should  not  be  attempted  under  any circumstances as the fingers could be severed if the strut released with a finger in the pin hole.  5.5.11.8.   An  alternate  method  to  break  the  strut  can  be  accomplished  by  applying hydraulic pressure to cylinders that will remove pressure from the pins.  Do not attempt to push out safety pins with fingers.  5.5.11.9.   Slowly, in unison (all four crewman), open the hydraulic pump valves by turning handles counterclockwise to REL (release) position.  This will lower all cylinders in unison ensuring that the strut knee joint is bending and is not locked straight.  5.5.11.10.  Check for obstructions that could prevent strut knee joints from bending.  5.5.11.11.  Ensure that strut knee joints are bending.  Stop operation immediately if strut knee joints are not bending and are locked straight.  Raise immediately and try again.  5.5.11.12.  Lower all four sides of dolly set to ground in unison, ensuring that adapter arms remain vertical (not tilted) while lowering dolly set until contact is made with the ground.  Tilted  adapter  arms  means  that  one  side  is  lowering  faster  or  lower  than  the  others.  However, to correct this condition, open the valves on the pumps of the tilted adapter and close  the  valves  on  the  other.    Activate  hydraulic  pumps  until  adapters  are  in  a  vertical (straight) position.  Note:  CAUTION – Serious damage to dolly set can result if only one strut knee joint is locked straight and lowering operation is continued.  Lowering operation should be stopped immediately if strut knee joint remains locked straight.  Raise dolly set and again try lowering.  5.5.11.13.  Reduce pressure in all four air springs to 10 psi after contact is made with the ground.  5.5.11.14.  Crew should stand clear of dolly set during lowering operation.  5.5.11.15.  Slowly close all four hydraulic pump valves by turning handles clockwise to PUMP position.  5.5.11.16.  Adapter arms must remain vertical  until  contact  is  made with the ground.  If adapter arms are tilted, the sides are not being lowered at the same rate.  5.5.11.17.  Each  crewman  should  loosen  his  strut  assembly  by  unscrewing  clamps.  Carefully,  with  hands  and  fingers  away  from  struts,  pump  hydraulic  pump  levers  until cylinders open strut knee joints at pivot point.  Apply hand pressure on the inside of pivot point  to  open  struts,  being  extremely  careful  not  to  allow  fingers  in  a  potential  "pinch" point.  The struts must break open at this point.  5.5.11.18.  Pushing the safety pins from the strut assemblies using the fingers should not be attempted under any circumstances as the fingers could be severed if the strut released with a finger in the pin hole.  5.5.11.19.  An  alternate  method  to  break  the  strut  can  be  accomplished  by  applying hydraulic pressure to cylinders that will remove pressure from the pins.  Note:  CAUTION – Do not attempt to push out safety pins with fingers.  5.5.11.20.  Serious  damage  to  dolly  set  can  result  if  only  is  one  strut  knee  joint  locked straight  and  lowering  operation  is  continued.    Lowering  operation  should  be  stopped immediately  if  strut  knee  joint  remains  locked  straight.    Raise  dolly  set  and  again  try lowering.  5.5.11.21.  Slowly,  in  unison  (all  four  crewmen),  open  the  hydraulic  pump  valves  by turning  handles  counterclockwise  to  the  REL  (Release)  position.    This  will  lower  all cylinders in unison ensuring that the strut knee joint is bending and is not locked straight.  5.5.11.22.  Check for obstructions that could prevent strut knee joints from bending.  5.5.11.23.  Ensure that strut knee joints are bending.  Stop operation immediately if strut knee joints are not bending and are locked straight.  Raise immediately and try again.  5.5.11.24.  Lower all four sides of dolly set to ground in unison, ensuring that adapter arms remain vertical (not tilted) while lowering dolly set until contact is made with the ground.  Tilted  adapter  arms  means  that  one  side  is  lowering  faster  or  slower  than  the  others.  However, to correct this condition, open the valves on the pumps of the tilted adapter and close  the  valves  on  the  other.    Activate  hydraulic  pumps  until  adapters  are  in  a  vertical (straight) position.  5.5.11.25.  Reduce pressure in all four air springs to 10 psi after contact is made with the ground.  5.5.12.  Leveling the shelter.  5.5.12.1.   To  level  shelter,  close  all  hydraulic  pump  release  valves  by  moving  valves clockwise to PUMP position.  5.5.12.2.   Open all hydraulic cylinder valves.  5.5.12.3.   Extend  all  hydraulic  cylinders  by  operating  manual  hydraulic  pumps  until  all cylinders are extended (leave pump control lever closed).  5.5.12.4.   Remove  the  individual  safety  lockout  pins  from  struts  and  free  the  individual mechanical struts.  5.5.12.5.   Close all hydraulic cylinders by placing hydraulic pump release valve in pump position.  Note:    The  shelter  payload  is  leveled  by  raising  or  lowering  the  four  hydraulic  cylinders independently as necessary.  There are two ways the shelter must be leveled:  end-to-end and side-to-side.  5.5.12.6.   Turning the pump release valve too quickly will allow the shelter to drop rapidly, causing possible damage to equipment and/or personnel injuries.  Stand clear of the dolly set and shelter during lowering operation.  5.5.12.7.   To  level  the  shelter  end-to-end,  SLOWLY  open  the  hydraulic  pump  release valves for both cylinders to be raised/lowered at the high end of the shelter by moving the associated hydraulic pump release valves to the REL position (counterclockwise).  5.5.12.8.   Slowly  turn  the  pump  release  valve  back  and  forth  between  PMP  and  REL positions as required.  5.5.12.9.  Gently lower shelter at  high  end until  both  ends of the shelter are  at  the same height.  5.5.12.10.  To level the shelter at high end until both ends of the shelter are at the same height (level).  5.5.12.11.  To level the shelter side-to-side, decide which side of the shelter is higher.  5.5.12.12.  Open the hydraulic cylinders, one on each dolly, on the cylinders on the high side of the shelter by placing the pump release valve to the REL position.  5.5.12.13.  Slowly turn pump release valves on the hydraulic pumps on the high side of the shelter back and forth between PMP and REL positions as required.  5.5.12.14. Gently lower shelter at high side until both sides of shelter are at the same level.  Note:  Additional leveling adjustment can be obtained by removing the bolts attaching the platform at either side on the rear dolly.  This will lower arm assembly.  The bolts at the front dolly can also be removed to provide additional leveling adjustment.  5.5.12.15.  Close all hydraulic cylinders by  coupling dolly  set  with  or without shelter to tow vehicle.  5.5.12.16.  Back-up tow vehicle and position near tow bar on the front dolly.  5.5.12.17.  Hook dolly set tow bar to pintle hook on tow vehicle.  5.5.12.18.  Hook up safety chains to tow vehicle.  5.5.12.19.  Connect intervehiclular electrical cable (front harness) between tow vehicle and front dolly junction box.  5.5.12.20.  Ensure chains and electrical cables do not drag.  5.5.13.
