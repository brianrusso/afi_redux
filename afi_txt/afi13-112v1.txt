Overview.  As  part  of  the  Air  Force  mission  to  conduct  close  air  support,  the  Air  Force provides JTACs to Combatant Commanders (CCDRs).  Per joint doctrine for CAS, a JTAC is a qualified (certified) Service member who, from a forward position, directs the action of combat aircraft  engaged  in  close  air  support  and  other  offensive  air  operations.    A  qualified  JTAC  is recognized  across  the  Department  of  Defense  as  capable  and  authorized  to  perform  terminal attack control (ref JP 3-09.3). 1.2.  Purpose  .  The purpose of this instruction is to  ensure standardized JTAC training across the Air  Force  and to  implement  the JTAC MOA.  Standardized training  ensures  all JTACs are capable of providing effective air control for all counterland operations, particularly CAS.  The complexity  of  integrating  CAS  with  fire  support  and  maneuver  units  requires  a  detailed understanding of air and space power.  This instruction provides the minimum training required for  personnel  to  attain  and  maintain  JTAC  qualification.    Air  Force  JTACs  meet  all  of  the requirements outlined in the JTAC MOA and Joint Publication 3-09.3, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Close Air Support (CAS). 1.2.1.  This instruction provides guidance for conducting a JTAC Training program that will complement  11-202,  Volume  1,  Aircrew  Training.    The  unit’s  JTAC  training  program  is governed by this AFI, and will be supplemented in an operating instruction (OI) (T-3).  The unit’s OI may be comprehensive for the entire unit’s training program or be a JTAC training specific  document.    Each  unit  with  a  JTAC  program  is  expected  to  have  a  JTAC  Training Plan. 1.2.2.  The  training  program  must  be  tailored  to  meet  the  unit’s  Joint  Mission  Tasks  List (JMTL)  and  the  aligned  Army  unit’s  Mission  Essential  Tasks  Lists  (METL).    In  addition, units  must style  the  training  program  towards  preparation  for  contingency  taskings  in  IAW the  Global  Force  Management  Allocation  Plan  (GFMAP)  and  the  unit’s  Designed Operational Capability (DOC). 1.3.  Ready  Joint  Terminal  Attack  Controller  Program  (RJP).  This  instruction  introduces the RJP, a MAJCOM-developed continuation training (CT) program, as a means to improve the proficiency of Air Force JTACs and to develop metrics that match resources with required JTAC training  requirements.    In  order  to  focus  resources  towards  developing  proficiency,  new  JTAC categories include experienced, inexperienced and BMC qualified in addition to CMR. 1.4.  Waivers.  Waivers  to  this  instruction  are  authorized  and  are  processed  IAW  AFI  33-360.  For  compliance  items  not  identified  with  a  Tier  number,  waiver  authority  is  delegated  to  the Headquarters  Air  Force  Combat  Air  Forces  (CAF)  Division  (AF/A3TC).    Waivers  for  non-Tiered  and  Tier  0  compliance  items  must  be  coordinated  through  the  MAJCOM  before submission to AF/A3TC for action.  Tier 1, 2, and 3 waivers automatically expire 30 days after a change of command unless the new commander renews the waiver.  At the unit level, the JTAC Program  Manager  should  monitor  implementation  of  this  instruction  and  review  approved waivers  anytime  the  circumstances  that  prompted  the  waiver  or  the  impacts  of  the  excepted activity change substantially. 6 AFI13-112V1  29 SEPTEMBER 2017 1.4.1.  Waiver requests.  Waiver requests will be submitted using the AF Form 679 and will include the information specified in AFI 33-360, paragraph 1.9.4.2.  Additional requirements are at the discretion of the waiver authority. 1.4.2.  AF/A3TC  will  coordinate  all  waiver  requests  with  ACC/A3J  for  the  purposes  of maintaining situational awareness as the lead MAJCOM. 1.5.  Supplements.  This  publication  may  be  supplemented  at  any  level.    All  supplements  are routed  as  indicated  in  1.5.1  for  coordination  prior  to  certification  and  approval.    Supplements may  change,  or  add  procedures,  as  applicable,  to  this  instruction,  but  changes  can  be  no  less restrictive  than  this  instruction.    All  supplements  are  published  IAW  AFI  33-360  on  the  AF electronics publications (e-pubs) website. 1.5.1.  For MAJCOM supplements, MAJCOMs must submit a copy to AF/A3TC for review and coordination prior to publication. 1.5.2.  For wing or unit supplements, units must submit a copy to the MAJCOM for review and coordination prior to publication.  When wing or unit supplements require update due to a  significant  change  in  range  operations,  submit  an  updated  supplement  to  the  MAJCOM within 120 days. AFI13-112V1  29 SEPTEMBER 2017 7 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

JTAC certification and qualification is a two-phased process consisting of formal schoolhouse training and unit level  training needed to  complete all requirements.  This  chapter outlines  the  JTAC  IQT  process  for  JTAC  trainees.    Once  JTAC  IQT  is  complete,  the  JTAC candidate  is  considered  a  certified  JTAC.    A  certified  JTAC  then  progresses  to  JTAC  MQT.  Completion  of  a  JFS  ESC  accredited  formal  JTAC  training  school  meets  the  formal  training requirement. 3.1.1.  AFSOC uses a two-phased process for JTAC IQT and JTAC MQT. Graduation from an  accredited  school  and  completion  of  Tables  A3.1  and  A3.2  (minus  initial  evaluation) completes the  AFSOC JTAC  IQT process.  The  first  duty  day back begins AFSOCs  JTAC MQT.    The  evaluation  for  JTAC  certification  will  be  conducted  at  the  completion  of AFSOCs  JTAC  MQT.    AFSOC  personnel  are  not  JTAC  certified  or  qualified  until  the completion  of  AFSOC  JTAC  MQT  and  an  initial  evaluation  is  completed  IAW  AFI  13-112V2. 3.2.  Entering JTAC IQT. 3.2.1.  Eligibility to enter JTAC IQT. 3.2.1.1.  Officers must possess a minimum 1-skill level in either AFSC 13CX or 13LX, or be  an  aircrew  member  ALO  with  one  year  of  operational  flying  experience  (as documented on an AF Form 8). 3.2.1.2.  Enlisted personnel must possess a minimum 3-skill level in AFSC 1C4X1 or a 5-skill level in AFSC 1C2X1. 3.2.2.  Prerequisites.  Individuals must complete all JTAC IQT prerequisites (“P”) identified in the “Training Phase” column listed in Table A3.2. as well as any additional requirements identified in the Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA). 3.2.2.1.  Units  are  encouraged  to  instruct  JTAC  candidates  on  close  air  support fundamentals and terminal attack control familiarization. 3.3.  6 CTS, USAFE AGOS, and 138 CTS JTAC Schoolhouses responsibilities  : 3.3.1.  Conduct control requirements identified in Attachment 3, Table A3.1 (T-0). 3.3.2.  Conduct training requirements identified Attachment 3, Table A3.2 (T-0). 3.3.3.1.

The evaluation  may be conducted  live or in  a 18 AFI13-112V1  29 SEPTEMBER 2017 high-fidelity dome simulator and be documented on an AF Form 8. Waiver authority is the schoolhouse director of operations. 3.3.3.4.  Provide  the  individual’s  unit  JTAC  PM  a  copy  of  the  course  completion certificate and note any training deficiencies, e.g., lack of a night terminal attack control (T-3). Note: A deficiency is any training requirement identified in Table A3.1 and A3.2 that has not been met for any reason. 3.3.3.4.1.  Training items not completed (training deficiencies) must be conducted at the unit-level (T-0). 3.3.3.5.  Issue  a  diploma  once  the  schoolhouse  has  verified  all  training  has  been completed. Provide a copy of the diploma to the unit JTAC PM and individual. 3.4.  Unit level training requirements. 3.4.1.  JTAC PM must review all schoolhouse training documentation and records in order to identify and track the required training necessary for JTAC IQT completion. 3.4.1.1.  Individuals  may  return  from  formal  training  without  meeting  requirements identified  in  Tables  A3.1  and  A3.2.    For  example,  the  individual  may  have  attended  a partner  nation  course  or  an  Air  Force  course  with  training  deficiencies.    When  an individual  returns  from  formal  training,  the  JTAC  PM  must  thoroughly  review  any documentation produced by the formal schoolhouse and ensure the documents are placed in the individual’s training and evaluation folder (T-0). 3.4.1.2.  Individuals must be task evaluated on each JMTL listed as a “P” in Table A3.2 (T-0). 3.4.1.3.  Once an individual has completed all of the training requirements in Tables A3.1 and A3.2, the individual must complete an initial evaluation  IAW AFI 13-112V2; if the evaluation  was  not  conducted  at  JTACQC.    Once  the  individual  has  successfully completed the initial evaluation, the individual is considered a certified JTAC.  However, designation as CMR or BMC requires successful completion of JTAC MQT. 3.4.2.  Individuals that have training deficiencies will (T-3): 3.4.2.1.  Complete required training within 90 days of return to the unit (T-3). 3.4.2.2.  Complete all required tasks according to the AFI 13-112V2 standard (T-3). 3.4.2.3.  Be supervised by a JTAC-I (T-2). 3.4.3.  JTAC  PMs  must ensure  all  required  training  is  completed.    Specifically,  JTAC  PMs will: 3.4.3.1.  Ensure training requirements are completed to the AFI 13-112V2 standard (T-0). 3.4.3.2.  Provide  the  formal  training  schoolhouse  all  documentation  once  the  training deficiencies are complete (T-2). 3.4.3.3.  Ensure  the  formal  training  graduation  certificate  has  been  filed  into  the individual’s training and evaluation folder (T-3). AFI13-112V1  29 SEPTEMBER 2017 19 3.4.3.4.

Live-fly training. 3.5.1.1.  A  JTAC-I  must  be  physically  located  with  the  trainee  for  all  live-fly  mission controls  and  be  capable  of  immediately  assuming  direct  control  of  the  aircraft  if necessary (T-1). 3.5.1.2.  Contracted CAS aircraft may be used to meet JTAC IQT training requirements. 3.5.1.3.  All live-fly training must include a mission brief and debrief (T-3). 3.5.1.4.  Live-fly  aircraft  are  not  required  to  complete  every  task,  however  a  full  CMP should be used when applicable. 3.5.2.  Virtual (simulator) training. 3.5.2.1.  With  the  exception  of  the  minimum  live-fly  requirements  identified  in  Table A3.1, all JTAC IQT task training should be conducted using high-fidelity simulation. 3.5.2.2.  JTAC IQT must be conducted in a JFS ESC accredited simulator (T-3).  If a JFS ESC  accredited  simulator  is  not  available,  the  parent  group  will  designate  alternative means to complete required training. 3.5.2.3.  All virtual training must include a mission brief and debrief (T-3). 3.5.2.4.  Virtual  CMPs  are  not  required  to  complete  every  task,  however  a  full  CMP should be used when applicable. 3.6.  JTAC IQT Failure to  Progress.  Completing JTAC certification is an AFSC requirement for  the  13LX  and  1C4X1  career  fields,  as  identified  in  the  applicable  classification  directive.  Commanders will consider Airmen for disqualification from the 1C4X1 or 13LX AFSCs when two  failed  attempts  of  successfully  completing  an  accredited  JTAC  schoolhouse  course  due  to academic failure or non-progression exists. 3.6.1.  Unit  commanders  should  review  the  AFSC  requirements  identified  in  AFI  36-2101, Classifying  Military  Personnel  (Officer  and  Enlisted)  and  Officer  and/or  Enlisted Classification Directory. 3.6.2.

Commanders should consult with the local Staff Judge Advocate before proceeding with any action to separate an individual. AFI13-112V1  29 SEPTEMBER 2017 21 Chapter 4 JTAC MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING 4.1.  General.  JTAC  MQT  is  the  enhanced  skills  training  required  for  a  certified  JTAC  to accomplish  the  unit’s  wartime  mission.    It  must  be  focused  and  tailored  on  the  unit  and/or aligned Army unit Mission Essential Tasks. 4.1.1.  Prior to entering JTAC MQT, JTAC PMs must ensure JTAC trainees have completed JTAC IQT. 4.1.1.1.  JTAC  MQT  begins  the  next  duty  day  following  successful  completion  of  an initial  JTAC  qualification  evaluation.  The  “date  completed”  block  on  the  AF  Form  8, Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification,  Section  I,  will  be  used  to  determine  the  next  duty day (T-3). 4.1.2.  JTAC trainees must complete JTAC MQT within 90 calendar days unless a break in training occurs and the JTAC MQT timeline is adjusted IAW Para 4.3 (T-3).  Timing starts from the JTAC trainee’s first duty day at the unit once the trainee has completed JTAC IQT.  Because  AFSOC  combines  JTAC  IQT  and  JTAC  MQT  as  part  of  their  initial  certification process, AFSOC personnel must complete JTAC MQT within 180 calendar days. 4.1.3.  JTAC MQT is complete upon accomplishing all unit specified requirements (T-3). 4.2.  JTAC MQT training requirements. 4.2.1.  Units  will  develop  lessons  covering  areas  pertinent  to  their  wartime  mission  as determined by the unit commander.  At a minimum, unit developed academics, tailored to the unit and aligned unit METL, will include the following (T-3): 4.2.1.1.  Briefing/debriefing procedures. 4.2.1.2.

Unit commanders may extend JTAC MQT training time line a maximum of 30 days for RegAF members or 3 Unit Training Assemblies (UTA) for ANG members. 4.3.2.1.  AFSOC  Extensions.    Group  commanders  may  extend  JTAC  MQT  training timeline a maximum of 30 days for RegAF members. Wing commanders may extend the time line an additional 30 days, and AFSOC/A3 commander may extend the time line an additional 30 days. 4.3.2.1.1.  AFSOC members who fail to complete JTAC MQT beyond the MAJCOM 30 day extension must re-accomplish JTAC IQT (T-2). 4.4.  JTAC MQT documentation. 4.4.1.  Commanders  must  approve,  in  writing,  an  individual’s  entry  into,  completion,  or removal from JTAC MQT on a MFR or electronic text entry in the individuals JTAC training and evaluation folder (T-3).  Units may conduct a recurring evaluation IAW AFI 13-112V2 to verify JTAC MQT completion. 4.4.2.  Commanders  must  approve  any  adjustment  to  JTAC  MQT  training  in  writing  on  an AF Form 623A to be placed in the individuals JTAC training and evaluation folder (T-3). 4.4.3.  JTAC  MQT  progression  will  be  documented  using  AF  Form  797,  Job  Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS (T-3). 4.5.  Regression.  Applicable portions of JTAC MQT may be used to requalify JTACs who have regressed  from  CMR,  specifically  addressing  the  deficiencies  that  caused  regression.    JTACSs are  not  required  to  enter  into  JTAC  MQT  to  utilize  portions  of  JTAC  MQT  to  address  these deficiencies. AFI13-112V1  29 SEPTEMBER 2017 23 Chapter 5 CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT) 5.1.  General.  This  chapter  explains  how  to  determine  JTAC  experience  levels,  proficiency requirements  within  the  RJP,  and  minimum  qualification  requirements.    CT  allows  JTACs  to maintain  combat  capability,  maintain  readiness,  increase  proficiency  and  consists  of  mission-related training. 5.2.  JTAC  Experience.  Allocation of JTAC training requirements and resources are based on an individual’s experience level in order to ensure resources are used effectively. 5.2.1.  Determination  of  Experienced.  At  a  minimum,  once  a  JTAC  has  successfully completed a minimum of three total evaluations with a Q-2 or better and have been awarded 40 RTM points, the unit commander may designate the individual as “Experienced.”  Once an  individual  has  been  designated  as  “Experienced,”  that  individual  will  always  remain “Experienced” (T-3). 5.2.1.1.  Points are accumulated by completing CMP RTM tasks.  JTACs will earn points for each entire completion of CMP RTM tasks. 5.2.1.2.  Individuals  will log RTM task completion using MAJCOM-directed automated means (e.g., TACTICS, AJACTS, etc.). 5.3.  JTAC Status.  JTACs are designated as either BMC or CMR.  Regardless of status, BMC and CMR JTACs are qualified USAF JTACs. 5.3.1.  Basic Mission Capable (BMC).  BMC establishes the minimum training requirements necessary  to  maintain  JTAC  qualification.    BMC  is  designed  for  experienced  JTACs assigned to positions that require the performance of JTAC duties where proficiency can be maintained at a reduced rate. Individuals assigned to JTAC positions that are not primarily to support an operational mission should be BMC, e.g., group or wing staff.  BMC requires: 5.3.1.1.  Completion of JTAC MQT. 5.3.1.2.  Successful completion of evaluation IAW AFI 13-112V2. 5.3.1.3.  Unit commander designation as BMC. 5.3.2.  Combat Mission Ready (CMR).  CMR establishes the minimum training required for qualified  JTACs  to  remain  proficient  in  all  of  the  primary  missions  for  their  aligned  unit.  CMR is designed for JTACs assigned to squadron-level and below. 5.3.3.  Unit commanders will identify which unit positions on their Unit Manning Document that should be BMC or CMR (T-3). 5.3.4.  Progression from BMC to CMR requires: 5.3.4.1.  One month of continuation training meeting the CMR rate. 5.3.4.2.  Completion of unit CMR academic training IAW the annually published RTM. 5.3.4.3.  Confirmation  that  the  progressed  JTAC  can  complete  the  prorated  number  of event requirements to remain CMR at the end of the training cycle. 24 AFI13-112V1  29 SEPTEMBER 2017 5.3.4.4.  Squadron commander certification. 5.4.  JTAC Qualification  . 5.4.1.  BMC and CMR JTACs must meet the semi-annual training requirements identified in Attachment 5, Table A5.1 (T-0). Note:  Attachment 5, Table A5.1 represents the minimum control requirements to maintain qualification.  5.5.  Regression to Unqualified, N-CMR, and N-BMC 5.5.1.  CMR/BMC JTACs regress to Unqualified (UQ) for the following reasons (T-0): 5.5.1.1.  Failure to meet Table A5.1 qualification requirements in this AFI. 5.5.1.2.  Failure to meet evaluation standards IAW AFI 13-112V2. 5.5.1.3.  JTACs  that  were  UQ  for  less  than  6  months  must  complete,  under  the supervision  of  a  qualified  JTAC-I,  all  live-fly  and/or  simulator  qualification  training requirements which caused the regression (T-2). 5.5.1.4.  JTACs that were UQ between 6 months to less than 18 months must complete all of the qualification training requirements in Table A5.1 under the supervision of a JTAC-I (T-2). 5.5.1.5.  JTACs that were UQ for 18 months or more must complete commander-directed qualification  training  requirements  in  Tables  A3.2  and  A5.1  under  the  supervision  of  a JTAC-I that culminates in an evaluation IAW AFI 13-112V2 (T-2). 5.5.2.  CMR/BMC JTACs regress to N-CMR/N-BMC for the following reasons: 5.5.2.1.  Members are placed in JTAC N-CMR/N-BMC status after failing to meet RTM lookbacks. 5.5.2.2.  Failure  to  complete  annual  RTM  training  requirements  within  the  allocated training cycle. Note: N-CMR/N-BMC JTACs maintain qualification as long as the minimum semi-annual requirements listed in Table A5.1 are met.  5.6.  Ready JTAC Program.  The RJP is the MAJCOM-developed Continuation Training (CT) program  designed to  develop  JTACs that focus training on capabilities needed to  accomplish  a unit's mission essential tasks.  RJP will be the mechanism for connecting resources to  required training requirements and building proficiency. 5.6.1.  RJP is a 12-month training cycle based on the fiscal  year  that defines the MAJCOM CT program and will be updated annually, or as required. CMPs and event requirements will be identified in the RTM. 5.6.1.1.  RJP  provides  the  framework  for  JTACs  to  conduct  core  JMTLs;  emphasizing specific  capabilities  that  are  tailored  to  a  unit’s  tactical  employment  with  co-located Army ground combat forces and Combatant Commanders (CCDRs) operational taskings. 5.6.1.2.  RJP requirements are based on completing full CMPs.  The CMP is based on the METL, JMTL and CCDR operational taskings. AFI13-112V1  29 SEPTEMBER 2017 25 5.6.1.3.  The total number of CMPs required is based on the JTAC’s experience level and designation as BMC or CMR. Note: See annually MAJCOM published RJP RTM for guidance on total number of CMPs each JTAC must complete.  5.6.1.4.  Units will determine academic training requirements to ensure compliance with METL, JMTL and operational instructions (T-3).  Verification of academic knowledge is IAW AFI 13-112V2. 5.6.2.  CAS Mission Profiles. 5.6.2.1.  CMPs  require  successful  completion  of  a  significant  portion  of  the  events applicable to that mission type, as determined by the unit commander. 5.6.3.  Units  will  produce  a  training  plan  that  identifies  how  a  unit  will  meet  monthly  and annual live-fly and simulator CMP requirements (T-3). 5.7.  Ready Tasking Message requirements. 5.7.1.  MAJCOMs will publish an annual RTM based on the fiscal year calendar. 5.7.1.1.  RTM  will  require  the  completion  of  the  entire  CMP  for  individual  JTACs  to receive credit for completing RTM requirements. 5.7.1.2.  RTMs will include CT requirements for live-fly and simulator CMPs. 5.7.1.3.  RTM will include CT requirements for CMR and BMC JTACs. 5.7.1.4.  RTM  will  include  CT  requirements  for  “Experienced”  and  “Inexperienced” JTACs. 5.7.2.  Reporting procedures. 5.7.2.1.  ACC/A3J  will  determine  for  the  Combat  Air  Force  and  Air  Force  Special Operations  Command  (AFSOC)/A3O  for  the  Special  Operations  Forces  monthly  and annual reporting procedures and formats. 5.7.2.2.  Units  will  report  CMPs  completed  quarterly  and  annually  based  on  the  fiscal year  to  parent  MAJCOM  (T-3).    Quarterly  reports  are  due  by  the  10th  day  of  the following  quarter  and  the  annual  report  is  due  by  10  October.  The  annual  report  is  a summary of the quarterly reports and will provide a summary of RTM accomplishment to the RTM requirements. 5.8.  Proration of training. 5.8.1.  Training  requirements  for  JTACs  that  are  not  available  for  performing  JTAC  duties will be prorated.  Note: JTAC qualification will not be prorated (T-0). 5.8.2.  Enter  the  number  of  months  a  JTAC  is  unavailable  into  TACTICS  or  applicable automated  system  to  prorate  remaining  training.    Training  will  be  prorated  using  the following formula: 5.8.2.1.  To determine the number of RTM events remaining that a JTAC must complete; use  the  following  formula  :  (#  months  available divided  by  12)  X  (#  of  annual  events), truncated to the nearest whole number. 26 AFI13-112V1  29 SEPTEMBER 2017 5.8.2.2.  For example, if a JTAC is attending in-residence professional military education, that  individual  is  not  available  to  perform  JTAC  duties.    The  individual  is  required  to perform 15 RTM CMPs.  If the course length is 3 months, then the JTAC should only be required to complete 75% of the annual RTM CMPs which translates to 11 RTM CMPs (9 divided by 12 times 15 = 11). 5.8.2.3.  The  following  absences  are  not  authorized  for  calculation  of  the  proration  of training formula: 5.8.2.3.1.  Ordinary or permissive leave status. 5.8.3.  JTACs completing JTAC MQT start CT on the first day of the next month. 5.8.3.1.  Training  accomplished  during  JTAC  IQT/JTAC  MQT  is  not  counted  toward RTM event requirements. 5.8.3.1.1.  Training accomplished during JTAC MQT is counted towards Table A5.1 qualification requirements and should be logged by the JTAC in TACTICS/AJACTS. 5.8.3.2.  Initial qualification dates for recurring Table A5.1 training events are established by the “DATE COMPLETED” date located on the most current AF Form 8, Certificate of  Aircrew  Qualification,  located  in  the  individual  JTAC’s  evaluation  folder  IAW  AFI 13-112V2. 5.8.3.3.  All requirements for JTACs departing PCS or separating are prorated to the last day of the month preceding the month of departure. AFI13-112V1  29 SEPTEMBER 2017 27 Chapter 6 SPECIALIZED JTAC POSITIONS 6.1.

Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC)— A status of a qualified JTAC who is familiarized in all, and proficient in some, of the unit’s operational mission, has been evaluated IAW AFI 13-112V2, and has commander certification—. Begin  Morning  Nautical  Twilight  (BMNT)  -  The  start  of  that  period  where,  in  good conditions and in the absence of other illumination, enough light is available to identify the general  outlines  of  ground  objects  and  conduct  limited  military  operations—.    Light intensification devices are still effective and may have enhanced capabilities.  At this time, the sun is 12 degrees below the eastern horizon (JP 1-02). Certified  (JTAC)  -  An  individual  who  satisfactorily  completes  the  appropriate  Service, United  States  Special  Operation  Command,  or  Partner  Nation  academic,  and  evaluation IAW AFI 13-112V2 may be granted JTAC certification—.  Note: Combat Control Team and TACP  operators  are  awarded  SEI  914  and  Special  Tactics  Officers  and  ALO  are  awarded  SEI O9C  upon  initial  JTAC  certification.    Once  certified  and  awarded  the  applicable  SEI,  a  JTAC remains certified permanently unless the certification is lost for cause. Chief,  WEPTAC  -  Graduate  of  the  USAF  WIC,  who  serves  as  the  unit’s  instructor  of instructors  and  is  responsible  for  the  grooming/upgrade  of  JTAC-Is  and  oversees  the training  and  utilization  of  the  unit’s  JTAC  instructor(s)—.    In  addition,  assists  the  unit commander in identifying weapons and/or tactics deficiencies and advises on necessary actions and programs to remedy problem areas. Close  Air  Support  (CAS)  -  Air  action  by  fixed-  and  rotary-wing  aircraft  against  hostile targets  that  are  in  close  proximity  to  friendly  forces  and  requires  detailed  integration  of each air mission with the fire and movement of those forces. (JP 3-09.3)—. Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR)  -  CMR  establishes  the  minimum  training  required  for qualified  JTACs  to  remain  proficient  in  all  of  the  primary  missions  for  their  unit  and aligned unit—.  CMR is designed for JTACs assigned to squadron-level and below. Commander Option Missions— A number of CMPs the commander allocates to each JTAC at the in  support of CT requirements and unit objectives. Commander option missions are part of the JTAC’s overall training cycle task events and may be designated uniquely for each JTAC or generally for all JTACs in the unit. CMPs may be for any mission type. This allows flexibility for commanders to allocate and define the CMPs throughout the training cycle. Continuation  Training  (CT)  –  Training  required  to  maintain  duty  position  qualification and proficiency—. Control  -  Consists  of  at  least  one  simulated,  dry  or  live  aircraft  (fixed/rotary  wing) attacking a surface target—.  The control should follow the CAS execution template IAW JP 40 AFI13-112V1  29 SEPTEMBER 2017 3-09.3/ATP 3.3.2.2.  An actual weapons release is not required.  No more than two controls (lead aircraft and wingman) can be counted per CAS briefing per target. Day Terminal Attack Control - Day terminal attack control is a control of CAS aircraft at a point after BMNT and prior to End of Evening Nautical Twilight (EENT)—. Dome Simulator - Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) and the ANG Advanced JTAC Training System (AAJTS) are the approved Air Force approved simulators that meet dome requirements for JTAC training—. End of Evening Nautical Twilight (EENT) - Occurs when the sun has dropped 12 degrees below the western horizon and is the instant of last available daylight for the visual control of limited ground operations—.  At the EENT there is no further sunlight available (JP 1-02). Forward Air Controller (Airborne) (FAC(A)) - A specifically trained and qualified aviation officer who exercises control from the air of aircraft engaged in close air support of ground troops—.  The FAC(A) is normally an airborne extension of the tactical air control party (JP 3-09.3). Global  Force  Management  Allocation  Plan—  Comprised  of  four  annexes  that  contain decisions  by  Secretary  of  Defense  (SecDef)  to  allocate  forces  and  it  is  published  by  the Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (CJCS).  Directs  the  joint  force  providers  to  publish  an annexed schedule that serves as the deployment order directing force providers to deploy forces at  the specified dates. Also allows force providers some leeway in  determining which unit will deploy and on the ordered latest arrival dates that the force provider must deploy to account for realities,  such  as  time-phased  force  and  deployment  data  (TPFDD)  refinement,  based  on transportation analysis or minor operational adjustments by the combatant commander (CCDR), and based on operational necessities. JTAC  (JTAC)  -  A  qualified  (certified)  Service  member  who,  from  a  forward  position, directs  the  action  of  combat  aircraft  engaged  in  close  air  support  and  other  offensive  air operations—.

Joint  Terminal  Attack  Controller-Instructor individual recommended  by  the  unit  Chief,  WEPTAC  and  designated  by  the  unit  commander  who provides training to unit JTACs—.  Responsible for implementing JTAC training per this AFI and developed by the unit’s Chief, WEPTAC. -  A  qualified (JTAC-I) JTAC  Initial  Qualification  Training  (JTAC  IQT)— A formal training process  consisting of an accredited JTAC Schoolhouse Course designed to initially qualify a JTAC in terminal control duties without regards to the unit’s operational mission. JTAC Mission Qualification Training (JTAC MQT) - Training required to achieve a basic level of competence in JTAC requirements and in a unit’s primary tasked missions—.  This training is a prerequisite for CMR status. JTAC Program Manager (JTAC  PM)— A highly qualified individual designated by the unit commander who is responsible for managing the unit’s JTAC upgrade and CT training programs. Ensures the requirements of AFI 13-112V1, are implemented. Laser Terminal Attack Control  - Laser terminal attack control is control of CAS aircraft using a laser target designation device or terminal guidance for air-to-ground munitions—.  Continuation  training  laser  controls  may  be  live,  virtual  or  constructive,  however,  live  is AFI13-112V1  29 SEPTEMBER 2017 41 preferred.    A  laser  terminal  attack  control  is  defined  as  control  of  CAS  aircraft  using  ground-based laser designation equipment where the JTAC has direct or indirect control over activation and deactivation. Live  Terminal  Attack  Control  -  Live  terminal  attack  control  is  control  of  aircraft  where air-to-ground munitions (live, inert or training ordnance) are released from the aircraft—. Live  Training  –  Live  training  is  that  which  is  conducted  in  a  physical  environment—.   It normally occurs on ranges/maneuver areas or in a military operating area. Virtual Training - Virtual training provides crews, leaders and units with realistic training experiences  using  a  variety  of  means  ranging  from  the  use  of  sophisticated  simulators  to practical exercises—.  Simulators operating on virtual terrain take the place of weapon systems and can be linked to expand the scope of the training event (e.g., JFS ESC accredited simulator). Constructive Training - Constructive simulation training is the use of computer models and game-type  simulations—.    These  tools  permit  multiple  echelons  of  command  and  staff  to execute  their  normal  warfighting  tasks  in  an  unconstrained  exercise  environment  (e.g.,  battle command training plan exercises). Mission Essential Tasks List (METL) - A collective task on which an organization trains to be  proficient  in  its  designed  capabilities  or  assigned  mission  (JP  1-02)—.    Each  Air  Force unit and aligned or associated Army unit have a unit METL.  The ASOS specific METL can be found in Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS). Night Terminal Attack Control - Night terminal attack control is control of CAS aircraft at a  point  after  EENT  and  prior  to  BMNT,  with  or  without  the  use  of  night  observation devices or Infrared (IR) designators—. Non-Combat  Mission  Ready  (N-CMR):  Individuals  are  placed  in  JTAC  N—CMR  status after failing to complete annual RTM training requirements within the allotted training cycle or qualification  requirements  IAW  Table  A5.1  or  has  failed  to  meet  evaluation  requirements outlined in AFI 13-112V2. Practical Exercise (PE) - A CAS mission PE is a comprehensive training event that includes all areas of mission planning, coordination, and execution, but does not involve control of actual aircraft—.  The CAS mission PE is intended to make the most effective use of available training sorties by allowing personnel to become familiar with tactics, techniques and procedures prior to an actual mission.  Each CAS mission PE could have several different outcomes/training objectives based on the instructor’s inputs.  The PE provides instant feedback to an instructor and trainee in those areas needing improvement.  Instructors use actual mission profiles and mission-related  information  to  familiarize  the  trainee  with  what  to  expect  during  all  phases  of  mission execution.  Additionally, PEs can be used to complete identified CT requirements when live-fly aircraft,  equipment  or  ranges  are  not  available  to  complete  live  training  and  the  training objectives can be met by a combination of discussion, demonstration and/or performance of the tasks. Proficiency  -  Accomplishing  a  JMTL  or  METL  task  correctly  and  efficiently  without assistance—. Qualified  (JTAC)—  A  certified  JTAC  who  completes  the  established  minimum  recurring training IAW Table A5.1 and evaluation requirements 42 AFI13-112V1  29 SEPTEMBER 2017 Ready Joint Terminal Attack Controller Program (RJP) - The CT program is designed to focus  training  on  capabilities  needed  to  accomplish  a  unit's  core-tasked  missions—.  Following completion of JTAC IQT and JTAC MQT, units will assign JTACs to either a CMR position or a BMC position.  CMR JTACs maintain  combat readiness, while BMC JTACs may require  additional  training  prior  to  combat.  Each  MAJCOM  will  publish a  RJP  Ready  Tasking Message (RTM) to establish the CT requirements for all JTACs. Ready Tasking Message (RTM)— An annually published message sent from the MAJCOM to all  subordinate  units  with  JTACs  assigned.  It  lists  the  task  events  and  CMPs  necessary  to maintain CT rates required to sustain BMC or CMR status. Task Evaluation - A task evaluation is the completion of a task under the supervision of a trainer  in  order  to  certify  the  member  is  capable  of  performing  the  task  to  a  Go/No-Go standard—. Terminal  Attack  Control  -  A  control  consists  of  at  least  one  aircraft  attacking  a  surface target—.    The  control  begins  with  a  CAS  briefing  from  a  JTAC  and  ends  with  either  an actual/simulated weapons release or an abort on a final  attack run.  No more than two controls may be counted per CAS briefing per target. Unqualified  (UQ)  (JTAC)  -  Individuals  are  placed  in  “unqualified”  status  after  failing  to complete  training  or  qualification  requirements  within  the  allotted  training  cycle  or  has failed  to  meet  evaluation  requirements  outlined  in  AFI  13-112V2—.    “Unqualified”  is  a status  for  when  a  JTAC is  not  permitted to  control  aircraft  unsupervised.    Note:  even  when  an individual is placed in “UQ” status, the JTAC remains a “certified.”  AFI13-112V1  29 SEPTEMBER 2017 43 Attachment 2 GLOSSARY OF MISSION AND EVENT DEFINITIONS A2.1.
