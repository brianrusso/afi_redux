Purpose of the Program.  The Air Force Pavement Evaluation Program obtains, compiles, and  reports  pavement  strength,  condition,  and  performance  data,  including  data  on  structural, friction,  and  anchor  capability  on  all  airfields  with  present  or  potential  Air  Force  missions. Pavement evaluation data gives civil engineers the information needed to actively manage base and  airfield  pavement  systems,  as  well  as  providing  operators  the  information  they  need  to manage and control the airfield. They use the results of pavement evaluation studies to: 1.1.1.  Determine the size, type, gear configuration, number of passes, and weight of aircraft that can safely operate from an airfield without damaging the pavement or the aircraft. 1.1.2.  Develop or adjust operations usage patterns for a particular aircraft pavement system (for example, parking, apron use patterns, and taxiway routing). 1.1.3.  Project or identify major maintenance or repair requirements for an airfield pavement system to  support present  or proposed aircraft missions. Pavement evaluations  provide data used  in  engineering  assessments  and  asset  management.    Evaluations  are  also  a  quality reference aid when designing future projects. 1.1.4.  Develop and maintain airfield layout and physical property data to the section level to assist  airbase  mission  and  contingency  planning  functions  and  provide  information  for validation of real property records. 1.1.5.  Develop and confirm design criteria. 1.1.6.  Develop  and  justify  major  pavement  projects  and  maintenance  and  repair  (M&R) plans. 1.1.7.  Enhance flight safety by implementing recommendations from friction characteristics reports, when applicable. 1.1.8.  Verify that power check pad anchors can safely support aircraft engine maintenance. 1.2.  Program  Elements.  The  Air  Force  Pavement  Evaluation  Program  consists  of  several elements: 1.2.1.  Airfield pavement structural evaluations. 1.2.2.  Runway friction characteristics evaluations. 1.2.3.  PCI surveys for airfields and road and parking networks. 1.2.4.  Power check pad (trim pad) anchor tests. 1.2.5.  Pavement engineering assessments (EA). 1.2.6.  Asset management.   AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 7 1.3.  Types of Evaluations: 1.3.1.  Airfield  Pavement  Structural  Evaluation:  Determines the load-carrying capability of a pavement for various aircraft by testing the physical properties of the pavement system in its current condition. 1.3.2.  Runway  Friction  Characteristics  Evaluation:  Determines potential of a runway surface under standardized wet conditions. the  hydroplaning 1.3.3.  PCI  Survey:  Identifies  and  documents  pavement  distresses  caused  by  aircraft loadings,  vehicle  traffic,  and  environmental  conditions.  Base  and  command  personnel  use this data to: 1.3.3.1.  Determine the operational condition of pavements; 1.3.3.2.  Develop  and  prioritize  sustainment,  repair  and  restoration/modernization projects; 1.3.3.3.  Determine whether an airfield structural pavement evaluation is needed; 1.3.3.4.  Perform EAs; 1.3.3.5.  Manage assets. 1.3.4.  Power  Check  Pad  Anchor  Test:  Uses  specialized  equipment  and  procedures  to determine the capability of anchors to support aircraft engine tests. 1.3.5.  Engineering  Assessments:  EAs  are  analyses  currently  provided  as  part  of  PCI surveys that combine data from the PCI survey, structural evaluation, friction evaluation and FOD index and are conducted to prioritize pavement O&M projects. 1.4.  Asset  Management.  An  Activity  Management  Plan  (AMP)  is  prepared  to  determine  the funding  required  to  maintain  essential  infrastructure.  AMPs  include  information  on  Real Property inventory, Levels of Service (LOS), Key Performance Indicators (KPI), and the planned investments (projects/requirements) identified to achieve the required LOS (see Chapter 9). 8 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  Linear  Segmentation  Guidance.  Recent  efforts  by  the DOD to better manage infrastructure assets resulted in the publication of new guidance on Real Property  Inventory  Requirements  and  linear  segmentation  of  the  assets.    This  guidance  can  be found  at  http://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/Downloads/BSI/rpir_1-19-05.pdf  or  the  parent  website for  Business  Systems  and  Information,  http://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/BSI/BEI_RPA.html.    It establishes  a  framework  for  a  transformed  real  property  accountability  business  process,  and establishes  data  standards  required  to  manage  real  property  assets  throughout  their  life  cycle.  This AFI provides guidelines for linear segmentation of both airfield and roadway pavements to supplement DOD guidance and provides a common framework that enables pavement evaluation data  to  be  shared  with  real  property,  asset  management,  and  geospatial  information  systems.  This  integration  allows  these  systems  to  use  the  data  generated  by  recurring  pavement evaluations as an authoritative source of pavements inventory and condition data for the systems of (SMS)  Playbook  available  at https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/ceportal/CEPlaybooks/SMS/Pages/default.aspx  also  provides  a supplement to this AFI.   The  Sustainment  Management  System record. 3.1.1.  To  achieve  OSD  linear  segmentation  objectives,  data  elements  used  in  pavements management  are  related  to  data  elements  outlined  in  the  OSD  Real  Property  Information Data  Model  Version  and  implemented  in  the  Real  Property  Asset  Database  (RPAD).  Information at http://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/BSI/BEI_RPA.html.    The  key  field  of  importance  is  the  Real Property Unique ID (RPUID) which is linked to each section, although other fields are linked as  well,  including  the  Real  Property  Network,  Real  Property  Site  Unique  Identifier (RPSUID),  Facility  Number,  Facility  Analysis  Category  (FAC),  and  Category  Code (CATCODE).  Following is a description of these data elements. resources these on is available 3.1.1.1.  Real  Property  Network.  The  Real  Property  Network  groups  assets  based  on the  common  service  or  commodity  provided,  such  as  an  airfield  pavement  system  or road, street, and parking area system.  This concept aligns well with the network concept used in the pavement community.  The primary criteria for a network is that is can have only one Real Property Site Unique Identifier (RPSUID).  In addition, a network may be established for other reasons.  For example, even though they have the same RPSUID as the  main  base,  the  roads  and  parking  in  base  housing  may  be  a  separate  network, especially if they have been privatized.  Real property records, privatization agreements, or  survey  data  are  important  in  determining  where  exact  break  points  are  when transitioning  from  one  network  to  another.    Following  are  some  examples  of  networks that are established: - Airfield network for main base. - Paved and unpaved road and parking network for main base. - Airfield network for auxiliary fields or landing zones. - Paved and unpaved road and parking network for auxiliary fields or GSUs. - Paved road, driveway and parking network for housing. AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 13 3.1.1.2.  RPSUID.  The  RPSUID  is  a  unique  number  that  is  assigned  to  each  site  by OSD.  In most cases this equates to an installation. 3.1.1.3.  RPUID.  The  RPUID  is  a  non-intelligent  code  assigned  by  OSD  used  to permanently and uniquely identify a real property asset.  Note that there is a one-to-one relationship between the RPUID and the facility number. 3.1.1.4.  Facility Number.  The facility number has historically been used to identify real property  assets  on  AF  installations.  AFI  32-9005,  Real  Property  Accountability  and Reporting, paragraph 3.5. lists the facility number as one of the required fields that must be used when conducting a physical inventory. 3.1.1.5.  FAC.  The FAC is an OSD level designator that represents the current use by the assigned  user  of  a  specific  portion  of  the  real  property  asset.  For  example  FAC  1111 identifies a runway. 3.1.1.6.  CATCODE.  The  CATCODE  is  a  Military  Service  designator  that  represents the current use by the assigned user of a specific portion of a real property asset.  Each FAC  has  one  or  more  CATCODES  assigned  to  it.    For  example  CATCODE  111111  is the Air Force CATCODE for runways.  Note that CATCODES are not the same among the services.  A pavements facility can have only one CATCODE. 3.2.  Pavement  Management  Segmentation.  For  many  years,  engineers  have  segmented pavement  systems  into  basic  units,  designating  pavements  with  common  characteristics  as networks, branches, and sections.  Figure 3.2. shows the accepted schema for naming segments on an airfield and Figure 3.3. shows the schema for roads and parking areas. Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design; UFC 3-260-02, Pavement Design for Airfields; and UFC 3-260-03, Airfield Pavement Evaluation; also provide information on segmentation and procedures for identifying branches and sections of airfield pavements for both PCI and structural pavement evaluations. 3.2.1.  Network.  A  network  is  typically  characterized  as  all  pavements  with  a  similar function,  such  as  all  airfield  pavements  or  all  roads  and  parking  areas  on  a  base.    This construct  aligns  well  with  the  Real  Property  definition  of  a  network  as  described  above. Networks are further subdivided into branches that are a logical subset of the network. 3.2.2.  Branch.  A branch is a subset of the network such as a runway, a named taxiway or an apron for an airfield, or a named road or parking area.  Branches are subdivided into sections that are a subset of the branch with specific physical or usage characteristics. 3.2.3.  Section.  A  section  is  a  subset  of  a  branch  and  is  assigned  based  on  characteristics such  as  pavement  type,  use,  structure,  construction  history,  traffic  area,  rank,  or  condition.  Some  of  these  characteristics,  such  as  traffic  area,  are  just  applicable  to  airfields,  while others, such as pavement type apply to both airfields and roads. 3.2.3.1.  Pavement  Type.  There  are  several  pavement  types:  flexible,  rigid,  rigid  or flexible overlay on rigid, flexible overlay on flexible, composite, and reinforced rigid, as well as unsurfaced. A specific section contains only one pavement type.   14 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 3.2.3.2.  Pavement  Use.  Airfield  pavements  consist  of  runways,  taxiways,  aprons, overruns,  other  airfield  pavements  (e.g.  aircraft  ground  equipment  (AGE)  storage),  and shoulders.  The  pavements  not  associated  with  the  airfield  on  a  base  consist  of  roads, parking areas, and driveways. A section typically has a single pavement use. 3.2.3.3.  Pavement  Structure.  The  thickness  and  strength  of  the  pavement  and  soil layers  usually  vary  considerably  throughout  an  airfield  or  road  and  parking  system; however,  each  discrete  pavement  section  will  have  relatively  uniform  cross-sectional properties to represent the section. 3.2.3.4.  Construction History.  In most cases, pavements are constructed using different materials and techniques on various portions of the airfield or base at different times. All pavements included in a specific section have a consistent construction history. 3.2.3.5.  Pavement  Rank.  Pavement  sections  are  assigned  a  rank;  Primary,  Secondary, Tertiary, or Unused to  help  define the priority  of the structure in  the asset  management system as described in paragraph 9.3.1. A branch can contain pavements with more than one rank, so each section within the branch is assigned a rank. 3.2.3.6.  Traffic  Areas.  Airfield  pavements  are  divided  into  traffic  areas  based  on  the lateral  distribution  of  aircraft  traffic  and  effective  gross  aircraft  load.  These  areas  are designated types A, B, C, and D. A section typically has a single traffic area designation (e.g. A01B has a B traffic area).  Further details regarding traffic area segmentation rules are provided in paragraph 3.6. 3.2.3.7.  Pavement  Condition.  Each  pavement  section  has  consistent  characteristics  as addressed  in  paragraphs  3.2.3.1  through  3.2.3.6.    Sometimes  the  condition  of  the pavement in an area varies considerably. In this situation, the discrete pavement area can be  subdivided  into  separate  pavement  sections  based  on  the  surface  condition  of  the pavement.  See paragraph 3.6.4 for details on creating sections based on condition. 3.3.  Correlation  of  Real  Property  and  Engineering  Pavement  Linear  Segmentation Data.  The  general  hierarchy  for  integrating  pavement’s  real  property  and  engineering  data  is network,  facility,  branch,  and  section.    Typically,  there  will  be  a  one-to-many  relationship between each of these entities within the hierarchy (See Figure 3.1. below). 3.3.1.  Pavement Facilities and Category Codes:  In pavement terms, a facility is an area of pavement  with  a  specific  function  such  as  a  runway,  apron,  taxiway,  overrun,  shoulder, roadway(s), or parking area(s).  In real property guidance, the primary constraint for creating a  linear  facility  is  that  category  codes  cannot  be  mixed.    For  example,  overruns  (category code  111115)  cannot  be  combined  in  a  facility  with  the  main  load  bearing  surface  of  the runway (category code 111111). AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 15 Figure 3.1.  Segmentation Hierarchy.  3.3.2.  Creation/Designation  of  Pavement  Facilities.  Real  Property  guidance  requires  a real  property  record  be  prepared  for  each  real  property  asset.    In  practice,  bases  have implemented  these  rules  in  many  different  ways.    Each  base  will  have  a  pavement  facility map that shows the geospatial extents of each pavement facility in its real property records. (T-2).  If the base does not have one, it must create it to comply with Executive Order 13327   The  SMS  Playbook, “Federal  Real  Property  Asset  management. https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/ceportal/CEPlaybooks/SMS/Pages/default.aspx provides additional information on creating pavement facility maps.  The intent of the playbook is to provide standard guidance for creating pavement facilities to reduce the variability from base to  base  outlined  below  whenever  updates/changes  are  needed.    Following  are  standards  for defining pavement facilities: (T-1). 3.3.2.1.  Runways.  The  load  bearing  pavement  for  each  runway  at  a  base  will  have  its own facility number. The overruns for the runway  will have a separate facility number, and  the  runway  shoulders  will  have  a  separate  facility  as  well.    Use  the  predominant material type for each runway and overrun to populate the construction material code in ACES / TRIRIGA. 3.3.2.2.  Taxiways.  The  base  may  include  all  taxiways  in  one  facility  or  may  opt  to create  a  facility  for  each  named  taxiway,  but  in  no  case  will  a  base  create  multiple facilities  for  a  named  taxiway.  Bases  will  not  create  facilities  based  on  pavement  type.  This level of fidelity will be provided in the segments. For instance, Taxiway A will have only  one  facility  number  assigned  even  though  itis  constructed  of  both  concrete  and asphalt  pavement.  Use  the  predominant  material  type  for  each  taxiway  facility  to populate  the  construction  material  code  in  ACES  /  TRIRIGA.  If  all  taxiways  are aggregated in one facility, combine all taxiway shoulders into one facility.  If each named taxiway has its own facility number, the shoulders associated with each taxiway will be in a separate facility. 3.3.2.3.  Aprons.  Each contiguous main parking apron will have its own facility number. Dispersed parking pads with similar construction dates will be aggregated in one facility.  Bases  shall  not  create  separate  facilities  based  on  pavement  type  (construction  material code).    Use  the  predominant  material  type  for  each  apron  facility  to  populate  the construction material code in ACES / TRIRIGA®. 16 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 3.3.2.4.  Roads, Streets and Access Roads.  The term road is typically intended to mean highways,  roads,  and  streets.    OSD  guidance  calls  for  all  surfaced  roads  (CATCODE 851147) on a base to be included in one facility.  A separate facility will also be created for  all  unsurfaced  roads  (CATCODE  852101).    In  no  case  will  a  base  create  a  separate facility for all concrete roads and one for all asphalt roads.  Use the predominant material type  for  each  road  facility  to  populate  the  construction  material  code  in  ACES  / TRIRIGA.  In  addition,  any  pavement  that  provides  access  to  a  building,  loading  dock, dumpster, etc., is considered a road rather than a driveway. 3.3.2.5.  Driveways.  The term driveway has been used to refer to pavements that provide access  to  buildings,  loading  docks,  dumpsters,  parking  areas,  etc.    The  current  AF  real property definition of a driveway (CATCODE 851145) is a private road leading from a street or other thoroughfare to a building, house, or garage.  It is normally a hard surfaced road  constructed  of  concrete  or  asphalt.    UFC  3-250-01FA,  Design  of  Roads  Streets, Walks  and  Parking  Areas  and  UFC  3-250-18FA,  Geometric  Design  for  Roads  Streets and Walks clearly intends for the term driveway to be associated with a residence in the housing  area.    Driveway  facilities  will  be  used  to  designate  driveways  in  base  housing areas only.   All surfaced driveways associate with a given housing area will be included in  one  facility.    In  no  case  will  a  separate  facility  be  created  for  all  concrete  driveways and  one  for  any  asphalt  driveways,  or  some  variation  thereof.  Use  the  predominant material  type  for  each  driveway  facility  to  populate  the  construction  material  code  in ACES / TRIRIGA. 3.3.2.6.  Parking  Areas.  Parking  areas  include  both  the  parking  area  itself  and  the pavement  that  provides  access  to  the  parking  area.    There  are  currently  six  different category  codes  for  surfaced  and  unsurfaced  parking  areas.    At  a  minimum,  a  separate facility should be created for the pavements in  each of these category codes.  The main rule of thumb is that parking areas with different category codes cannot be included in the same  facility.    Do  not  create  separate  facilities  for  concrete  parking  areas  and  asphalt parking  areas.    Use  the  predominant  material  type  for  each  parking  area  facility  to populate the construction material code in ACES / TRIRIGA. 3.4.  Assigning  Branches  and  Sections  Facilities.  The  pavement  facility  map  plays  a  crucial role in correlating engineering pavement segments (branches and sections) to pavement facilities.  To start the correlation process, obtain the pavement facility map depicting the location of each pavement facility on the base from the responsible GeoBase office.  As mentioned previously, if the base does not have this map, the base must ensure it is created. (T-2).  Without this map, it is not  possible,  to  correlate  engineering  segments  to  real  property  pavement  facilities.    The  map should  clearly  show  the  geospatial  extent  of  each  pavement  facility  listed  in  the  real  property record.  It includes all paved and unpaved airfield, road, driveway, and parking surfaces. 3.4.1.  In order to  align  branches and sections from  the pavement management system  with facilities in the real property system, branches and sections used in past pavement evaluations may  need  to  be  modified  to  align  with  the  facility/branch  hierarchy  and  to  ensure  the boundaries of the branches and sections align properly with the facilities. 3.4.2.  When  problems  or  discrepancies  are  identified,  such  as  inability  to  maintain  facility branch hierarchy, incorrect facility boundaries, or erroneous category codes, discuss the issue with  the  base  pavement  engineer,  real  property  officer  and  the  GeoBase  office  and  make AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 17 needed changes to  real property facility numbers and the pavement facility map outlined in the Pavement Linear Segmentation Playbook. 3.4.3.  The real property data elements identified in section 3.1 are integral to the PAVER 7.0 data schema so pavements management data and real property facility data can be correlated.  The  real  property  data  elements  are  assigned  at  the  network,  branch  or  section  level  as appropriate.    PAVER  and  the  Pavement  Computer  Aided  Structural  Engineering  (PCASE) program share inventory, meaning that PCASE uses the same branch and section structure as PAVER  and  data  for  a  given  base  can  be  stored  in  a  common  database  for  use  by  both programs. 3.4.4.  PAVER  and  PCASE  have  a  GIS  capability  which  allows  the  user  to  import  a  shape file  and  create  associations  between  the  branches  and  sections  in  the  inventory  and  the polygons on the map that define the geospatial extent of the branches and sections.  Creating these relationships using PAVER-PCASE ensures adherence to all business rules. 3.4.5.  Once a relationship is created between facilities, branches, and sections, the area and condition data in PAVER, as well as the structural capacity data generated by PCASE, can be shared  with  real  property,  asset  management,  and  geospatial  information  systems.    The primary key used to exchange data between PAVER-PCASE and these other systems is the RPUID. 3.5.  Branch Level Airfield Pavement Segmentation Rules.  A branch is assigned to only one facility and a section is assigned to only one branch.  A branch is given both a branch name and a branch  unique  ID  in  PAVER-PCASE.    If  a  branch  has  multiple  facility  numbers  assigned,  the Real Property Officer (RPO), base pavement engineer, and GeoBase office should work together to resolve the issue.  Following are some general guidelines for assigning branches to facilities: 3.5.1.  Runways.  The load bearing surface of each runway is typically a branch.  Assign that branch  to  the  facility  for  that  runway.    The  overruns  for  a  runway  constitute  one  branch.  Assign  the  overrun  branch  to  the  overrun  facility  for  that  runway.    The  shoulders  for  each runway  are  typically  a  branch.    Assign  that  branch  to  the  appropriate  shoulder  facility whether all shoulders are one facility or there is a separate facility for runway shoulders. 3.5.2.  Taxiways.  For linear segmentation  and  evaluation  purposes,  a taxiway is defined as one  with  an  alphanumeric  designation  (e.g.  Taxiway  A,  Taxiway  A1).    The  distinction  is discussed further in paragraph 3.6.7.  In pavement management, the load bearing surface of each named taxiway is typically a branch.  If the taxiway has a shredout (e.g. Taxiway A1) include  it  in  the  branch  with  the  same  alpha  designation;  in  this  this  example,  Taxiway  A.  Assign these branches to the appropriate facility number per the pavement facility map.  The shoulders  for  taxiways  are  also  given  a  branch  designation.    Assign  that  branch  to  the appropriate  shoulder  facility,  whether  all  shoulders  are  one  facility  or  there  is  a  separate facility for taxiway shoulders. 3.5.3.  Aprons.  Aprons are more of a challenge  than  runways and taxiways.  There are ten different category codes for various types of aprons.  In general, aprons can be divided into two  types;  those  used  to  park  aircraft,  such  as  a  main  parking  apron  or  dispersed  parking pads,  and  those  used  for  short-term  parking,  such  as  an  arm/disarm  pad,  a  hangar  access apron,  or  an  AGE  equipment  parking  area.  There  is  one  category  code  for  aircraft  parking aprons  and  nine  for  other  aprons  used  by  aircraft  and  support  equipment.    Main  parking 18 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 aprons or dispersed parking pads (CATCODE 113321) have an AP prefix in the branch name (e.g.  APMAIN)  and  all  other  aprons/pads  have  an  OA  prefix  in  the  branch  name  (e.g. OAHOTCARGO). 3.5.3.1.  Divide each contiguous main apron into separate branches based on operational use.  For  example, a portion of the apron is  used for the primary mission aircraft and  a portion is used for transient aircraft or an Air National Guard or Reserve mission.  These branches are assigned to the appropriate facility as needed. 3.5.3.2.  Dispersed  parking  aprons  are  typically  grouped  into  a  single  branch.    For instance, all parking pads on the loop taxiway would be in the branch APLOOP.  If each of the individual pads has been assigned a facility number, creating a separate branch for each of these facilities significantly complicates analysis.  In these instances, work with the  RPO,  base  pavement  engineer,  and  GeoBase  office  to  resolve  the  issue  by aggregating the dispersed parking pads in a single facility as described previously. 3.5.3.3.  For other aprons, use the category code as the guide for creating branches.  For example,  all  arm/disarm  pads  (CATCODE  116661)  on  an  airfield  are  included  in  a branch.    If  the  base  has  created  a  separate  facility  for  each  arm  /  disarm  pad,  create  a separate branch for each.  Create a separate branch for compass calibration pads, power check pads, dangerous cargo pads, etc. 3.5.3.4.  The  shoulders  for  all  aprons  are  assigned  to  a  branch.    Shoulder  branches  are assigned  to  the  appropriate  facility.    Assign  that  branch  to  the  appropriate  shoulder facility  whether  all  shoulders  are  one  facility  or  there  is  a  separate  facility  for  apron shoulders. 3.5.3.5.  Apron  pavements  used  exclusively  as  AGE  equipment  parking  areas (CATCODE 852273) or Vehicle Parking Refueling (CATCODE 852269) are not given a traffic type in the inventory. Note: this does not apply to areas where AGE equipment or aircraft refueling trucks may be occasionally parked on other apron pavements. 3.6.  Section Lvel Airfield Pavement Segmentation Rules.  In addition to the branch level rules outlined  above,  other  general  rules  apply  to  creating  and  modifying  sections.    The  SMS Playbook;  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/ceportal/CEPlaybooks/SMS/Pages/default.aspx  gives some specific examples to supplement the information provided below. 3.6.1.  Airfield Section Naming Conventions. Figure 3.2. below provides an overview of the rules and codes for designating sections.  Each  airfield section for a specific network has a unique number assigned.  For instance, section R01A1 could identify the keel section of the first thousand feet on a given runway.  That section number is not used anywhere else on that airfield. 3.6.2.  As new sections are created and old ones deleted, over time the section numbering on a  base  can  become  complicated.    In  the  past,  teams  would  completely  re-number  the sectioning  on  a  base  to  follow  a  pattern  and  make  it  easier  to  locate  sections.    While renumbering  the  whole  airfield  or  road  network  does  make  locating  sections  easier,  it presents  other  issues  with  continuity.    Therefore,  do  not  completely  re-number  pavement sections  to  “clean  up”  the  drawing  as  part  of  an  evaluation.    The  benefit  of  each  section having  the  same  number  over  time  outweighs  the  inconvenience.    This  is  especially  true AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 19 when  trying  to  correlate  pavement  management  data  with  real  property  and  asset management systems. 3.6.3.  If a new section is created, give it the next consecutive number available or shred out the section if only a portion of a section is reconstructed and it is structurally the same as the parent section (for example, A10B would be shred out into A10B1 and A10B2).  If a section is reconstructed, but the geospatial extents do not change significantly, keep the same section number.  If the section is reconstructed and the shape changes significantly, DO NOT re-use section  number.  Delete  the  section  number  in  the  physical  property  data  (PPD)  sheet,  but retain it in the construction history with a note that it was demolished or reconstructed.  Due to inconsistent application of these rules in the past, there may be gaps in section numbering, but  no  clear  indication  of  why  these  numbers  are  no  longer  used.    If  the  omitted  section numbers are verified as not being used in past evaluation reports, the numbers may be used.  Once a number is assigned, do not use it again. 3.6.4.  Each pavement section has relatively uniform cross-sectional properties. Sections can be  created  with  shredouts  if  they  are  structurally  the  same  but  have  a  different  rank  or significantly different PCI.  The primary purpose for this business rule is to allow pavement evaluation  teams  and other users to  quickly identify pavements with  similar structures on  a map and to increase the efficiency of testing.  Sections with shredouts are consolidated when performing  coring,  dynamic  cone  penetrometer,  and  heavyweight  deflectometer  (HWD) testing. 3.6.4.1.  Do not shred out a section that has different physical characteristics.  If a portion of a section is reconstructed and is now structurally different, the new portion should get a  new  section  number.    For  example,  a  portion  of  an  asphalt  ladder  taxiway  section, T14C,  is  reconstructed  with  concrete  as  part  of  a  runway  military  construction (MILCON)  project.    The  new  section  should  be  given  the  next  consecutive  unassigned section number rather than dividing the section into T14C1 and T14C2. 3.6.4.2.  A  pavement  that  is  milled  and  overlaid  with  the  same  thickness  of  asphalt  that was in  the original section would be considered  structurally  similar unless heavyweight deflectometer testing indicates otherwise. 20 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 Figure 3.2.  Airfield Segmentation Schema.  3.6.5.  Runways.  The keel section of the runway sees a much higher volume of traffic than the outer portions and therefore usually has a different PCI deterioration rate.  To address this issue, designate the keel section of the runway as a section separate from the outer portions.  The keel section is given a shred out (e.g. R01A1) and the outer (noncontiguous) portions of the  runway  are  given  a  shred  out  (e.g.  R01A2).  The  R01A  designation  indicates  that  both sections  have  similar  construction  and  the  shredout  indicates  the  sections  have  another characteristic that warrants they be separated, such as rank or in this case, PCI. 3.6.6.  Overruns.  Overruns and the outside portion of some runways are designed using a D traffic area.  For evaluation purposes, overruns are typically evaluated with a C traffic area if evaluated for load bearing capacity with the exception of section 3.6.6.1 below.  The primary reason  for  this  is  that  evaluating  an  overrun  with  a  D  traffic  area  results  in  high  allowable gross loads (AGLs) and a pavement classification number (PCN) that may be misleading to those  using  the  report.  Typically,  an  overrun  has  a  tertiary  rank  unless  there  is  an  aircraft arresting system present in which case it will be secondary. 3.6.6.1.  Overruns  can  be  constructed  with  a  Type  A  traffic  area  to  increase  the  takeoff length  for  mission  aircraft.    In  these  instances,  the  pavement  should  be  marked  with  a displaced threshold and classified (CATCODE) as a runway rather than an overrun.  The section has an R designation, be given an A traffic area, and it is identified as a primary pavement. Overruns on unsurfaced landing zones are always evaluated as A traffic.   AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 21 3.6.6.2.  If  it  is  marked  as  a  runway  with  a  displaced  threshold  but  is  included  in  an overrun facility, identify the issue to the base to update the current use (CATCODE).  If the  CATCODE  is  correct,  label  it  as  an  overrun  with  an  A  traffic  area  and  give  it  a primary rank. 3.6.7.  Taxiways,  Access  Taxiways,  and  Taxilanes.  While  the  term  taxiway  is  often  used for  all  three  of  these  entities,  they  are  each  defined  slightly  differently  and  are  treated differently. See UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design, and UFC 3-260-02, Pavement Design for Airfields for specific definitions. 3.6.7.1.  For linear segmentation and evaluation purposes a taxiway is defined as having an alphanumeric designation (e.g. Taxiway A, Taxiway A1 or East Loop Taxiway). If a named  taxiway  passes  through  an  apron,  it  is  considered  a  separate  branch/section  than the apron pavement. As shown in Figure 3.2., a taxiway has a T designation. A primary taxiway  has  an  A  traffic  area,  while  ladder  taxiways  or  taxiways  that  only  have  a  low volume of traffic typically have a C traffic area. 3.6.7.2.  A taxilane on an apron does not typically have an alpha designation.  It may or may not have the same representative thickness as the apron but is considered part of the apron in either case.  If the taxilane has a different structure than the surrounding apron pavement, it is subdivided into a separate section of the apron branch, given an A prefix and  given  the  same  traffic  area  as  the  surrounding  apron;  typically  B  type  traffic  for  a main apron or C for a hangar access apron. 3.6.7.3.  Access  taxiways  may  or  may  not  have  an  alphanumeric  designation  and  as  the name  implies,  have  the  sole  purpose  of  providing  access  to  a  main  or  hangar  access apron, pad, or washrack, etc.  Historically, access taxiways have been given either A or T designations and may have A, B, or C traffic areas.  In an effort to standardize, many past designations need to be updated.  Following is guidance for these updates:  Do not create a separate section for an access taxiway if it is the same construction as the apron or pad that it is accessing.  If the construction is different, make it a separate section and give it a T designation.  Note that even though it has a T designation, it is considered part of the apron  facility  and  branch  and  has  the  appropriate  apron  CATCODE.    It  has  the  same traffic area as the apron or pad to which it provides access.  This is typically either B or C traffic as outlined in UFC 3-260-02, Figures 3-1 thru 3-3. 3.6.8.  Shoulders.  Shoulders  are  typically  designed  to  support  vehicle  traffic  and  are  not given a traffic area in design.  AFCEC does not evaluate the structural capability of shoulders as part of an evaluation.  Shoulder pavement is not given a traffic type in the inventory. 3.6.9.  Random Slab Replacement and Minor Asphalt Repairs.  Do not subdivide sections that have randomly replaced slabs, have asphalt patches or small areas where the asphalt has been replaced.  Generally, a section should only be subdivided when it is a large section and the  replaced  pavement  is  contiguous  and  comprises  25  percent  or  more  of  the  existing section.    Determining  what  constitutes  a  large  section  and  when  to  break  out  a  section involves  engineering  judgment.    The  intent  is  not  to  break  out  sections  unless  it  has  a significant impact to the outcome of the evaluation or the ability of the base to manage their pavement. 22 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 3.6.10.  Pavement  Rank.  Sections  may  be  created  to  differentiate  between  the  relative importance of the pavement to the mission.  Consider a situation where the main apron was built  at  one  time  with  similar  construction  throughout  and  is  assigned  a  facility  number.  Assume the facility has one branch (APMAIN).  Currently a portion of the apron supports the assigned  flying  mission,  but  half  the  apron  is  only  used  occasionally  for  air  shows  or overflow  transient  aircraft.    The  portion  of  the  apron  that  supports  the  active  mission  is primary  and  the  remaining  apron  is  tertiary.    Divide  the  apron  into  two  sections  (A01B1 primary  and  A01B2  tertiary  for  example).    That  they  both  have  the  designation  A01B indicates  they  are  structurally  similar  and  the  shredout  is  used  to  differentiate  other differences, such as rank in this case. 3.6.11.  Pavement Condition.  In general, only shred out additional sections on an apron or taxiway due to condition if the area involved is 25% or more of the total section area and the weighted area average PCI of the sample units within each area differs by at least 15 points.  Note  that  these  criteria  are  somewhat  arbitrary  and  are  intended  as  a  rule  of  thumb.    The objective is to only create new sections that significantly impact the results of the evaluation.  Don’t subdivide small sections. 3.7.  Segmentation  of  Roads,  Driveways,  and  Vehicle  Parking  Areas.  As  outlined  in paragraph  3.4.,  the  starting  point  for  aligning  branches  and  sections  from  the  pavement management system with real property facilities is obtaining a pavement facility map that clearly shows the geospatial extent of each pavement facility listed in the real property record (including paved  and  unpaved  roads,  drives,  and  parking  areas).    If  the  base  does  not  have  a  pavement facility map, they must create it before branches and sections can be assigned to the facilities. (T-2). The base Real Property Officer will work with the base Pavement Engineer and the GeoBase office to ensure that each pavement facility on a base is identified on the map. (T-3). 3.7.1.  The  segmentation  taxonomy  for  roadways  and  parking  areas,  as  for  airfields,  is network, branch, and section, as shown in  Figure 3.3. The same processes described above for creating a pavement facility map and assigning branches and sections to airfield facilities applies.  In addition, the same hierarchy shown in  Figure 3.1. for network, facility, branch, and  section  applies  to  roads  and  parking  areas.    Following  are  some  specific  rules  for segmenting roads and vehicle parking areas. 3.7.2.  Several networks are typically created for an installation.  One is created for all paved and unpaved roads, driveways, and parking  areas.   In most instances, a separate network is created  for  housing  areas,  especially  if  there  is  indication  they  may  be  privatized.  Separate networks are also created for the roads and parking associated with  geographically separate sites. AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 23 Figure 3.3.  Segmentation of Roads and Parking Lots. 3.7.3.  Branches.  Historically, each named road on a base and each parking area or group of parking  areas  associated  with  a  specific  building  or  function  have  been  given  a  branch designation.  Following are specific rules for creating these branches. 3.7.3.1.  Road Branches.  Each named road on a base is designated as a separate branch.  Each  of  these  branches  is  assigned  a  rank  based  on  the  criteria  outlined  in  paragraph 9.3.2.   If a portion of a  named road is  primary  and another portion is  secondary,  create separate sections for each.  3.7.3.1.1.  The  process  of  assigning  branches  and  sections  is  straight-forward,  if  all paved  roads  on  a  base  are  assigned  to  one  facility.    However,  it  becomes  more complex when a base has multiple road facilities.  Branches are created to ensure that no branch is assigned to more than one facility.  If a base has two sites or networks and a branch crosses into different sites or networks, the branch is divided to ensure a branch is not assigned to more than one network. 3.7.3.2.  Assigning Road Branches.  A surfaced road uses the prefix RD and unsurfaced road  uses  the  prefix  UR.    The  road  name  is  used  as  the  remainder  of  the  branch  name (e.g. RDMAIN or URPERIMETER).  There are instances where the road does not have a name, especially unsurfaced roads.  In these cases, give unnamed roads temporary names (URUNAMED1,  2,  3,  etc.).    Before  completing  the  report  have  the  base  review  all unnamed roads and provide names if they are available.  If names are not available, use the temporary name assigned. 3.7.3.3.  Parking  Area  Branches.  Assign  each  parking  area  or  group  of  parking  areas associated with a specific building or function a branch ID and name.  Note that a parking area  branch  includes  the  access  road  or  access  driveway  servicing  that  parking  area.  Each  of  these  branches  is  assigned  to  the  appropriate  facility.    This  is  straight  forward when  all  parking  areas  on  a  base  are  combined  into  one  facility  for  each  respective category  code  or  each  parking  area  has  its  own  facility  number.    The  pavement  facility map for roads and parking provides the primary guide for assigning branches to facilities. 24 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 3.7.3.4.  Assigning  Parking  Area  Branches.  Typically,  the  parking  area  uses  the building  number  it  is  associated  with  or  the  function  of  the  parking  area  as  the  branch name  (e.g.  PA1138  or  PAEXCHANGE).    If  the  parking  area  does  not  have  a  name; especially  unsurfaced  parking  areas,  give  the  unnamed  parking  area  a  temporary  name (PAUNNAMED1,  2,  3,  etc.).    Before  completing  the  report  have  the  base  review  all unnamed parking areas and provide names if they are available.  If they are not available, use the temporary name. 3.7.4.  Sections.  A  section  is  a  portion  of  a  branch  that  differs  in  pavement  characteristics from other sections such that segmentation is needed to uniquely identify that section.  This may  include  pavement  type,  construction  history,  traffic  volume,  or  other  physical characteristics, such as the number of lanes in the case of a road.  Note that sections for roads and  parking  are  treated  differently  than  those  for  airfields  in  that  the  section  number  for  a road or parking area is unique for each branch but is not unique for the base as a whole.  For example, the branch for Main  Street,  RDMAIN  has 24 sections numbered 01 thru 24.  The branch for Flightline Road, RDFLIGHT is made up of 16 sections numbered 01 thru 16.  The only  way  to  distinguish  a  section  uniquely  is  by  the  concatenation  (branch  ID  plus  section ID) of the branch and the section. 3.7.4.1.  Road  Sections.  If  there  is  a  long  road  section  with  consistent  physical characteristics, create a section break approximately every half mile.  Since base roads do not typically have mile markers, try to create these breaks where the road intersects with another  road,  a  parking  area,  or  some  other  distinguishable  feature.    The  intent  of  this guidance is not to create a section break at each intersection, but rather to create enough sections to ensure adequate sampling for projecting maintenance and repair requirements. 3.7.4.2.   Section  Breaks  at  Intersections.  Pavement  section  breaks  are  not  created  at each  intersection  unless  there  is  a  change  in  characteristics  or  some  other  factor  that drives  the  creation  of  the  section  break  at  that  intersection.    When  required  at  an intersection,  the  section  break  is  shown  as  a  single  line  perpendicular  to  the  centerline.  The  pavement  in  the  intersection  is  assigned  to  the  road  with  the  higher  rank.    When roads are of equal rank, the pavement in the intersection is assigned to one of the roads, ensuring there is no double counting of pavement area. 3.7.4.3.  Parking  Area  Sections.  Similar  to  roads  and  airfields,  parking  area  branches are  subdivided  into  sections  based  on  their  physical  characteristics  or  construction history.  The access road serving a parking area is part of the branch for that parking area and  is  assigned  the  appropriate  parking  area  category  code  for  that  facility.    If  the pavement  that  provides  access  to  the  parking  area  has  the  same  construction  as  the parking area it serves, it can be included with the parking area section.  If the pavement is constructed differently or is long, it is assigned a separate section number. 3.7.4.4.  Driveways.  As  mentioned  in  3.3.2.5,  the  term  driveway  refers  specifically  to pavements  in  housing  that  services  a  residence(s).    All  driveways  on  a  base  may  be included in a single facility or each specific housing area may be designated as a separate facility.  All  driveways  on  a  given  street  should  be  included  in  a  single  branch  and  that branch assigned to  the appropriate driveway  facility.  Each individual driveway may be assigned  a  section  if  it  has  sufficient  area,  or  groups  of  driveways  with  similar characteristics may be combined in a section to get an adequate sample unit.  Note that if AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 25 the  housing  area  is  privatized,  inventory  the  roads,  driveways,  and  parking,  but  do  not inspect  them.    If  the  housing  area  is  not  privatized,  inspect  the  pavements  unless otherwise stipulated in the Statement of Work. 3.8.  Pavement Segmentation Mapping.  Mapping plays a key role in achieving the OSD linear segmentation objectives. In order to ensure the entire pavement inventory is mapped consistently and accurately, pavement evaluation teams and contractors use the following process when doing a structural pavement evaluation or pavement condition index survey.  Additional details can be found at https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/ceportal/CEPlaybooks/SMS/Pages/default.aspx Playbook accessed SMS that can be in the 3.8.1.  Obtain  the  latest  Pavement  Facility  Map  and  Common  Installation  Picture  (CIP)  as well  as  the  latest  imagery  from  the  base  prior  to  beginning  the  evaluation.    Ensure  the metadata associated with both the CIP and imagery and determine the source and accuracy of the  vector  data  in  the  CIP.    In  addition  obtain  a  copy  of  the  Airfield  Pavement  Plan  (E-7 Tab),  and  Airfield  Pavement  Details  (E-8  Tab)  if  available.    Identify  any  significant  issues with  the  mapping,  such  as  misaligned  pavements,  duplicate  polygons,  or  other  issues  that affect  the  accuracy  of the map.  The metadata plays a key role in  that the pavement  vector data in the CIP may have been generated from earlier imagery or an actual survey.  If this is the  case,  the  vector  data  may  not  align  with  the  current  imagery.    Ensure  that  any  changes made to the CIP are based on more accurate data.  Work with the installation GeoBase office to resolve any issues prior to the start of the evaluation. 3.8.2.  Current  guidance  in  this  AFI  drives  changes  to  past  pavement  segmentation.    Make any  required  changes  to  the  branches  and  sections  based  on  the  current  imagery,  pavement facility  map,  and  construction  history  data  provided  by  the  base  prior  to  the  evaluation.  During  the  evaluation,  make  modifications  to  the  branches  and  sections  as  well  as  any changes required to the CIP based on field observations.  Document the changes made to the CIP for coordination with the base as a separate document when submitting the report. 3.8.3.  Provide  a  copy  of  the  updated  map  (in  shape  file  format),  along  with  the  change documentation, to the base GeoBase office for review at the base outbrief.  Address all base comments  regarding  mapping  and  provide  the  base  with  a  response  on  resolution  of comments. 3.8.4.  Provide a copy of the updated map (in shape  file format  and/or  geodatabase format) with  the  final  report.    Note  that  in  addition  to  the  shape  file,  contractors  are  required  to provide all source files in ESRI or AutoCAD format, as appropriate. (T-3). 26 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 Chapter 4 COMPREHENSIVE AIRFIELD PAVEMENT EVALUATION 4.1.  Basic Concepts.  In theory, the pavement evaluation procedure is the reverse of the design procedure. The design procedure uses a known design aircraft loading and foundation strength to determine  the  physical  characteristics  of  the  required  pavement  structure.  The  evaluation procedure  uses  known  physical  characteristics  to  determine  allowable  gross  loads  (AGL)  at various pass levels for specific aircraft groups. In addition to structural considerations, a visual survey  is  conducted;  although  there  is  not  a  direct  correlation  between  surface  condition  and pavement strength, the current condition and level of distress can indicate areas of concern (weak subsurface, overloading, etc.). This section outlines some basic principles and factors that affect pavements and explains how to systematically obtain physical property data. 4.1.1.  Size of Load. 4.1.1.1.  To  compute  loads  on  the  pavement  structure,  the  Air  Force  uses:  aircraft  gross weights; gear configurations; tire spacing (for multiple wheel assemblies); tire pressure or contact area; and weight distribution/center of gravity. 4.1.1.2.  To  simplify  the  mechanics  of  the  evaluation,  AFCEC  assigns  Air  Force  and selected  DOD  and  commercial  aircraft  to  14  aircraft  groups  (see  Figure  4.1.).  It  then selects  a  controlling  aircraft  for  those  aircraft  groups  containing  more  than  one  aircraft. The controlling aircraft is the aircraft in a particular group that causes the maximum state of stress in a pavement system. 4.1.2.  Frequency  of  Load.  Load  repetitions  (aircraft  passes)  greatly  affect  pavement  life. Pavement  life  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  different  aircraft  weight  and  pass  level combinations. Definitions of passes are contained in UFC 3-260-03. The Air Force evaluates each section for the 14 aircraft groups at the four pass intensity levels shown in  Figure 4.1. Figure  4.2.  shows  the  gear  type  for  each  aircraft  and  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration (FAA) designation. Stress points used to calculate allowable loads are also indicated by the red “+” symbols under each gear configuration. 4.1.3.  Distribution of Loads.  Distribution of loads also affects pavement life. Traffic tends to  be  more  concentrated  (channelized)  on  taxiways  and  runway  ends  and  more  evenly distributed (nonchannelized) on the interior portions of runways and on aprons. 4.2.  Determination of Pavement Capability. 4.2.1.  AGL.  For each section, AFCEC determines separate AGLs for the four pass intensity levels shown in Figure 4.1. Only four pass levels are used to simplify reporting. The AGLs associated with levels I through IV are based on the physical property data or layered elastic data for each section. For frost-susceptible areas, AFCEC publishes a second table of AGLs if applicable (see UFC 3-260-03). These AGLs are determined for each section for the four pass intensity levels but are based on reduced subgrade strength or reduced modulus values during  the  frost-thaw  period.  For  sections  with  a  PCI  less  than  or  equal  to  40,  the  AGL  is reduced  by  25  percent.  Values  in  the  AGL  tables  are  capped  at  2  million  pounds  (907,185 kilograms). AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 27 Figure 4.1.  USAF Aircraft Group Index and Pass Intensity Levels.  28 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 Figure 4.2.  Gear Types.  4.2.2.  Pavement  Classification  Number  (PCN).  AFCEC  determines  and  reports  the airfield  PCN,  as  defined  by  the  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO),  for  each airfield  section  where  aircraft  actively  operate.  The  PCN  expresses  the  capability  of  a pavement  to  support  aircraft  traffic  and  varies  with  aircraft  weight,  gear  configuration,  and the number of passes. However, since ICAO only requires reporting the PCN of the runway, the runway PCN is reported on the documentation page and executive summary of the report. The runway PCN is based on the weakest section in the first 1,000 feet (305 meters) of each end of the runway (full width) or in the central keel (75 feet [23 meters]) for the remainder of the  runway.  Overruns  and  the  remaining  non-keel  pavements  of  the  runway  interior  are excluded.  The  Air  Force  standard  for  reporting  PCNs  is  50,000  passes  of  a  C-17.  This  is because  the  C-17  is  the  primary  heavy  cargo  aircraft  for  the  Air  Force  and  is  expected  to continue to be the primary heavy cargo aircraft well into the future. Using a standard aircraft and number of passes enables the Air Force to compare pavement capability across the entire Air  Force.  The  Army  and  Navy  select  a  critical  aircraft  and  project  passes  or  equivalent passes for the pavement life, normally 20 years. 4.2.3.  Evaluation  Technique.  AFCEC  follows  these  fundamental  steps  in  all  pavement evaluations: 4.2.3.1.  Thoroughly  study  all  existing  information  regarding  design,  construction, maintenance, and traffic history of the pavements. AFCEC also reviews: 4.2.3.1.1.  Previous pavement evaluation and PCI reports. 4.2.3.1.2.  Results of physical property tests of pavements. AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 29 4.2.3.1.3.  Weather records for the vicinity. 4.2.3.1.4.  Soils and drainage data. 4.2.3.1.5.  Airfield and installation master plans. 4.2.3.1.6.  Installation pavement management plans. 4.2.3.2.  Determine or validate the pavement condition by a full visual (PCI) inspection. The  standard  PCI  rating  process  is  outlined  in  American  Society  for  Testing  and Materials (ASTM) D5340, Standard Test Method for Airport Pavement Condition Index Surveys  and  (ASTM)  D6433,  Standard  Practice  for  Roads  and  Parking  Lots  Pavement Condition Index Surveys. Note that the Air Force uses the terms standard, simplified, and cursory  for  it  PCI  surveys.    The  APE  Team  and  our  consultants  conduct  a  standard evaluation in which we inspect enough random sample units to achieve a 95% confidence level.  A simplified PCI uses the minimum number of random samples as outlined in the ASTM, and a cursory PCI includes an inspection of a “representative sample” that is less than  the  minimum  number  of  samples  outlined  in  the  ASTM.    Further  details  are discussed in section 8.1.4.1. 4.2.3.3.  Determine the scope and validity of available data and determine what additional information and tests are needed. 4.2.3.4.  Obtain field data and samples. Samples are tested in the field or sent to AFCEC for laboratory testing and data analysis. 4.2.3.5.  Select the representative strength and thickness values for the individual sections that comprise the pavement structure. 4.2.3.6.  Determine  AGLs  and  PCNs  for  each  pavement  section  using  representative physical property data and field test results. 4.2.3.7.  Develop recommendations for major M&R based on results of the evaluation. 4.3.  Methods and Procedures. 4.3.1.  All  airfield  evaluations  are  centrally  managed  at  AFCEC  with  a  comprehensive evaluation  to  include  structural,  friction,  and  PCI  evaluations  performed  by  AFCEC/COAP on  an  8-year  cycle  for  Active  and  Reserve  bases  with  an  interim  PCI-only  evaluations scheduled for performance by contract at the 4-year point between full structural evaluations. 4.3.2.  All ANG owned installations have a full structural evaluation on a recurring 16-year schedule.  CETSC conducts PCI surveys for ANG owned installations on a recurring basis.  CETSC  provides  PCI  survey  reports  and  updated  PAVER  management  system  files  to AFCEC upon completion. 4.3.3.  AFCEC centrally manages road and parking PCI surveys at active duty and Air Force Reserve  locations.  These  surveys  funded  through  AFCEC  and  executed  by  contract  on  the same  cycle  as  the  airfield  surveys  (every  four  years).    CETSC  centrally  manages  road  and parking PCI surveys at ANG owned installations. 4.3.4.  In the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, AFCEC/COAP publishes a schedule of bases that  are  scheduled  for  an  evaluation  the  following  fiscal  year.  They  accept  input  from  the 30 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 MAJCOMs  and  bases  on  any  needed  changes  and  once  validated  by  AFCEC,  changes  are made and the final schedule is published. 4.3.5.  MAJCOMs  (including  AFRC)  or  COCOMs,  or  CETSC    may  also  submit  additional requests  for  evaluations  to  support  exercises  or  contingency  operations  at  any  time.    Each year’s schedule takes into account the possibility of a few additional evaluations and pending quantity and priority of out-of-cycle requests, AFCEC reserves the right to alter the 16-year schedule if requirements necessitate. 4.3.6.  In AFIMSC/MAJCOMs/AFCEC consider: prioritizing requests for evaluations at additional installations, 4.3.6.1.  Time since the last evaluation. Structural evaluations normally occur every 7 to 10 years. 4.3.6.2.  Operational requirements or mission changes that significantly change pavement loading. 4.3.6.3.  Safety issues caused by structural deterioration since the last evaluation. 4.3.6.4.  Plans for major reconstruction or rehabilitation projects. 4.3.6.5.  New  construction  for  which  there  is  no  sufficient  design,  as-built,  or  physical property data to determine the pavement’s load-bearing capability. 4.3.7.  Approximately  3  months  before  the  evaluation,  AFCEC/COAP  sends  a  letter  to  the scheduled  installation  detailing  the  support  required  for  the  evaluation.    For  PCI  contracts, AFCEC  will  coordinate  the  schedule  with  the  bases  after  contract  award.    Once  bases confirm  that  dates  are  acceptable,  the  contractor  conducting  PCI  inspections  sends  a coordination  email  30  days  prior  to  the  evaluation  with  information  on  the  personnel conducting the evaluation and request for current GIS and work history information from the base. 4.4.  Field  Tests.  During  the  field  testing  phase  of  an  AFCEC  pavement  evaluation,  required pavement and soil layer physical property data are obtained. 4.4.1.  Base airfield operations personnel should plan on a minimum NOTAM closure of 12 hours (during daylight) for each runway that will be evaluated on the installation. However, the pavement evaluation team can respond quickly to emergencies if the runway is needed. 4.4.2.  The Pavement evaluation team determines which data are needed and which specific types  of  tests  to  conduct  based  on  pavement  type,  construction  history,  problem  areas, mission, and various other factors. 4.4.3.  The  pavement  evaluation  team  obtains  data  and  samples  and  conducts  assessments, including: 4.4.3.1.  Type of pavement. 4.4.3.2.  In situ pavement  and soil layer thicknesses, including total  thickness  above the natural subgrade for flexible pavements. 4.4.3.3.  Cores  used  to  determine  the  thickness  of  surface  materials  and  the  flexural strength of the concrete using split-tensile tests. AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 31 4.4.3.4.  Heavy weight deflectometer (HWD) deflection measurements used to determine pavement  capability  using  modulus  of  elasticity  and  layered  elastic  theory  (non-destructive evaluation). 4.4.3.5.  Strength and thickness of underlying layers (California Bearing Ratio (CBR) or k (modulus of subgrade reaction) value) using the dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) or the automated DCP (semi-destructive). 4.4.3.6.  Effective modulus of subgrade reaction for rigid pavements or CBR for flexible pavements measured in excavated pits (destructive evaluation, not commonly used due to impact on operations). 4.4.3.7.  Modulus of elasticity for each pavement and soil layer (non-destructive). 4.4.3.8.  In situ moisture content and density of subgrade soils and base course materials (destructive evaluation). 4.4.3.9.  Visual  assessment  of  pavement  surface  condition  (PCI)  and  documents  by updating the PAVER database. 4.4.3.10.  Soil samples, as needed. Sieve analysis and Atterberg limits tests are performed to classify the soil using the Unified Soil Classification System. 4.4.3.11.  Quality of subgrade, subbase, and granular base courses (tested in situ). Note: Laboratory tests on samples of materials and construction control data supplement the field tests. The team determines the pavement and soil layer physical properties by visual observations, laboratory tests on pavement samples, and/or from construction data. 4.5.  Laboratory Tests.  ASTM standards are used for laboratory and field testing. As with field testing, the data and types of tests required in the laboratory vary with the situation. 4.6.  Evaluation  Procedure.  The  evaluation  team  thoroughly  analyzes  all  available  physical property  and  laboratory  data  and  selects  representative  thickness  and  strength  data.    The  team also  selects  the  appropriate  evaluation  methodology  and  computational  software  to  utilize  in order to determine the AGL and PCN for each section. 4.7.  Reports. 4.7.1.  Preliminary Findings.  The pavement evaluation team typically provides an outbrief to base officials after completing field investigations. The outbrief summarizes the results of the  visual  inspection,  field  testing  accomplished,  preliminary  test  results  and  data  analysis. Additionally, the evaluation team will provide preliminary recommendations with immediate actions required, if any. 4.7.2.  Final  Pavement  Evaluation  Report.  AFCEC  prepares,  publishes,  and  distributes  a final  pavement  evaluation  report  after  all  laboratory  and  field  testing  has  been  completed, results analyzed, and AGL and PCN values determined. The report includes: 4.7.2.1.  Background Information:  A general description of the airfield, aircraft traffic, construction history, climatic and geological conditions, soil conditions and drainage, as well as frost evaluation considerations. 32 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 4.7.2.2.  Pavement  Condition:  A discussion of the findings of the visual survey, along with  the  other  aspects  of  the  pavement  evaluation,  such  as  structural  and  friction observations. 4.7.2.3.  Conclusions  and  Recommendations:  The  engineer's  conclusions  and recommendations based on data analysis. Topics typically include: 4.7.2.3.1.  The capability of various airfield pavement sections to support current and projected aircraft traffic; 4.7.2.3.2.  Observations on the overall condition of the airfield pavements; and, 4.7.2.3.3.  Recommendations for major M&R and construction. 4.7.3.  Appendices:  Information, data, and test results that document the evaluation.  Table 4.1  lists  the  standard  report  appendices,  which  are  tailored  to  each  evaluation  and  may  be supplemented by additional appendices when necessary. Table 4.1.

Distribution of Reports.  Electronic copies of the structural report are provided to the base pavement  engineer,  airfield  manager,  and  are  kept  on  file  at  AFCEC.  Additionally,  copies  are made  available  through  the  AFCEC  Pavements  Reports  Web  site,  and  notifications  are  sent  to Air  National  Guard,  Air  Force  Reserves,  Defense  Technical  information  Center  (DTIC), National  Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency  (NGA),  and  HQ  AMC/A3.  Contact  AFCEC  for  a detailed distribution list. 4.9.  Updating Physical Property Data. 4.9.1.  To  ensure  that  physical  property  data  remain  current,  construction  agencies  must provide the as-built or design data on all airfield pavement projects to the BCE. The BCE, in turn, provides a copy of the following information to AFCEC on pavements that have been constructed or reconstructed since the last pavement evaluation: 4.9.1.1.  Type of surface and texture (PCC, AC, surface treatment and burlap drag, wire combed, grooved, porous, rough, medium, and smooth, etc.). 4.9.1.2.  Thickness of the pavement and each layer in the pavement structure. 4.9.1.3.  Subgrade and base course moisture contents and densities. 4.9.1.4.  PCC flexural strength test results. 4.9.1.5.  CBR/k/modulus values from design/construction records. 4.9.2.  The BCE maintains construction records, including as-built drawings on all pavement projects that are under BCE control. 4.9.3.  If  the  airfield  pavement  undergoes  major  changes,  such  as  reconstruction  or rehabilitation,  AFCEC  may  use  as-built  and  construction  control  data  to  reevaluate  the pavement  and  provide  updated  PCNs  without  conducting  additional  field  testing  (at AFCEC’s discretion). 34 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 Chapter 5 RUNWAY FRICTION CHARACTERISTICS EVALUATIONS 5.1.  Runway Friction Characteristics Evaluation.  Runway friction characteristic evaluations assesses  a  runways  skid  resistance  and  it’s  potential  to  contribute  to  a  hydroplaning  incident. Since these properties are subject to change with time and traffic, an evaluation determines what, if any, maintenance may be required in order to restore pavement surface friction to acceptable levels. 5.1.1.  Frequency.  Installations should conduct runway friction characteristics testing when: 5.1.1.1.  A  significant  portion  of  the  runway  (1000  ft.  or  more)  has  been  reconstructed, altered by a surface treatment, or re-textured (grooving, or diamond grinding).  AFCEC recommends including friction testing as part of the scope of the construction contract or in conjunction with a rubber removal contract. 5.1.1.2.  Recent  evaluation  reports  recommend  follow-on  testing  or  a  mission  change significantly  alters  the  runway's  rate  of  wear  and  rubber  accumulation.    AFCEC recommends  a  commercial  vendor  provide  the  friction  testing.    Contact  AFCEC  for recommended commercial vendors. 5.1.1.3.  A  mission  change  significantly  alters  the  runway's  rate  of  wear  and  rubber accumulation. 5.1.1.4.  An aircraft skidding accident or incident occurs.  Contact AFCEC to request an out-of-cycle runway friction characteristics evaluation. 5.1.2.  Evaluation Schedule.  AFCEC develops an annual friction characteristics evaluation program  concurrently  with  comprehensive  airfield  pavement  evaluations.  The  scheduling process is described in section 4.3. 5.1.3.  Support  Requirements.  AFCEC  provides  the  base  detailed  support  requirements prior to the evaluation. 5.1.4.  Evaluation  Procedures.  The  evaluation  report  describes the  procedures  for evaluating runway friction characteristics, including equipment descriptions, testing methods, and some theory on their use. Testing includes friction tests, slope measurements, and texture measurements.  Procedures  and  equipment  generally  correspond  to  those  outlined  in  FAA Advisory  Circular  (AC)  150/5320-12C,  Measurement,  Construction,  and  Maintenance  of SkidResistant Airport Pavement Surfaces. 5.1.5.  Evaluation  Report.  After  conducting  the  field  evaluation,  AFCEC  analyzes  the results  and  includes  an  interpretation  of  the  results  in  the  comprehensive  airfield  pavement evaluation report or publishes a stand-alone report. This report typically includes: 5.1.5.1.  A summary of the pertinent data and results; 5.1.5.2.  Interpretation  of  the  results  based  on  these  criteria  and  the  judgment  of  the engineer; 5.1.5.3.  A brief narrative that presents  the engineer's conclusions and recommendations for improving the runway's friction characteristics; and, AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 35 5.1.5.4.  Appendices  that  document  the  data  collected  during  testing.  These  appendices are described in Table 5.1. Table 5.1.  Friction Characteristics Evaluation Report Appendices. Appendix  Description A B C D Slope Measurements: Displays the slopes measured on the runway. The transverse and longitudinal slopes are measured every 500 feet (152 meters). Texture Measurements: Presents the texture depth for various locations and the rainfall intensities required to flood these areas. Friction Measurements: Contains average friction values and friction plots for the entire length of the runway and describes the guidelines for determining acceptable friction characteristics. Estimation of Rubber Deposits: Presents a method to determine rubber removal requirements based on visual inspections. 5.2.  Distribution of Runway Friction Characteristics Evaluation Reports.  See section 4.8. 5.3.  Runway Roughness Evaluation.  Excessive runway profile roughness can increase fatigue on  airplane  components  and  reduce  braking  action.    A  runway  roughness  evaluation  examines the elevation profile of the runway surface and evaluates aircraft response to this profile. Newly constructed  runway  pavements  can  be  evaluated  to  help  ensure  longitudinal  slopes  meet established design criteria. Differential frost heave can also affect a runways longitudinal profile and  cause  excessive  roughness.  AFCEC  doesn’t  conduct  this  type  of  evaluation  but  maintains contact  with  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA),  the  FAA,  and  other organizations conducting research in this field and with contractors that perform the evaluations. Bases requiring a runway roughness evaluation can contact AFCEC for assistance. 5.4.  Runway  Friction  Restoration  Determination.  One  of  the  leading  causes  of  surface friction  deterioration  on  installations  is  contamination  of  the  pavement  surface  due  to  rubber build-up.  Most  bases  schedule  runway  rubber  removal  based  on  the  amount  of  time  between cleanings or a visual inspection rather than measuring the friction reduction effects of the rubber accumulations  using  continuous  friction  measuring  equipment  (CFME).  The  following subparagraphs, adopted in part from FAA AC 150/5320-12C and other FAA standards, provide guidance for using a CFME unit to aid in the identification of surface friction deterioration and determine  the  need  for  rubber  removal.  This  guidance  also  provides  the  information  necessary for installations to utilize CFME information to adjust rubber removal frequencies. AFCEC does not routinely schedule friction tests strictly to determine when to remove rubber. Installations are encouraged to establish a contract avenue to have friction testing conducted in between AFCEC evaluations so that they can effectively track pavement friction performance and program surface rehabilitation and maintenance projects as needed. 5.4.1.  Background.  Skid  resistance  of  runway  pavement  deteriorates  due  to  a  number  of factors,  primarily:  1)  mechanical  wear  and  polishing  action  from  aircraft  tires  rolling  or braking  on  the  pavement  and  from  snow  removal  equipment,  and  2)  the  accumulation  of contaminants,  chiefly  rubber,  on  the  pavement  surface.  The  effects  of  these  two  factors  are directly  dependent  on  the  volume  and  type  of  aircraft  traffic.  In  addition,  rubber  deposits obscure airfield markings, which can become a safety issue. The most persistent contaminant 36 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 problem is deposits of rubber from tires of landing jet aircraft. Rubber deposits occur at the touchdown  areas  on  runways  and  can  be  quite  extensive.  Heavy  rubber  deposits  can completely cover the pavement surface texture, causing loss of aircraft braking capability and directional control, particularly when runways are wet. 5.4.2.  Minimum  Friction  Survey  Frequency.  Table  5.2  is  provided  as  guidance  for scheduling runway friction testing for rubber removal. This table is based on an average mix of  turbojet  aircraft  operating  on  any  particular  runway.  When,  of  the  total  aircraft  mix,  a runway end has 20 percent or more wide body aircraft (e.g., B-52, C-5, C-17, C-130, KC-10, KC-135, etc.), select the next higher level of aircraft operations in Table 5.2 to determine the minimum testing frequency. As data is accumulated on the rate of change of runway friction under various traffic conditions, the scheduling of friction surveys may be adjusted to ensure that  evaluators  detect  and  predict  marginal  friction  conditions  in  time  to  take  corrective actions. Table 5.2.  Friction Testing Frequency (From FAA AC 150/5320-12C). Number of Daily Minimum Aircraft Landings Per Runway End* Minimum Friction Testing Frequency Less than 15 16 to 30 31 to 90 91 to 150 151 to 210 Greater than 210 *Each runway end should be evaluated separately, e.g., Runway 18 and Runway 36. 1 year 6 months 3 months 1 month 2 weeks 1 week 5.4.3.  General  Requirements.  AFCEC  does  not  recommend  that  installation  seek  to establish  an  in-house  friction  testing  program.  The  cost  and  effort  required  to  maintain  a compliant friction testing program at the installation level is typically not an advantage to the government and has been unsuccessful in the past. Program requirements are provided below and  can  serve  as  guidelines  when  developing  contract  requirements.    Installations  must obtain AFCEC approval prior to purchasing of any friction testing equipment. (T-1). 5.4.3.1.  FAA Performance Standards for CFME.  Appendix 3 of FAA AC 150/5320-12C  contains  the  performance  specifications  for  CFME.  These  standards  should  be followed in procuring CFME and replacement tires for the equipment. 5.4.3.2.  FAA Qualified Product List.  The equipment listed in Appendix 4 of FAA AC 150/5320-12C  has  been  tested  and  meets  the  FAA  standards  for  CFME  for  use  in conducting maintenance friction tests. 5.4.3.3.  Training  of  Personnel.  As stated in  FAA AC 150/5320-12C, “The success  of friction measurement in delivering reliable friction data depends heavily on the personnel who  are  responsible  for  operating  the  equipment.  Adequate  professional  training  on  the operation  and  maintenance  of  the  CFME  and  the  procedures  for  conducting  friction measurement  should  be  provided,  either  as  part  of  the  procurement  package  or  as  a separate contract with the manufacturer. Also, recurrent training is necessary for review AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 37 and update to ensure that the operator maintains a high level of proficiency.” Experience has shown that without recurrent training, personnel are not aware of new developments on  equipment  calibration,  maintenance,  and  operating  techniques.  A  suggested  training outline  is  provided  in  Appendix  5  of  FAA  AC  150/5320-12C.  Training  should  include both  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  CFME  and  the  procedures  for  conducting friction surveys. These procedures are provided in section 5.4.4 of this AFI. 5.4.3.4.  Equipment  Calibration.  All  CFME  should  be  checked  for  calibration  within tolerances provided by the manufacturer before conducting friction surveys. The CFME self-wetting system should be calibrated periodically to ensure that the water flow rate is correct and that the amount of water produced for the required water depth is consistent and applied evenly in front of the friction measuring wheel(s) for all test speeds. 5.4.4.  Conducting Friction Evaluations with CFME. 5.4.4.1.  Preliminary  Steps.  Friction  measurement  operations  should  be  preceded  by  a thorough  visual  inspection  of  the  pavement  to  identify  inadequacies  such  as  drainage problems,  including  ponding  and  groove  deterioration,  and  structural  deficiencies. Careful and complete notes should be taken, not  only of the CFME data but also of the visual  inspection.  Personnel  operating  equipment  should  be  fully  trained  and  current  in all  procedures.  The  CFME  should  be  checked  for  accurate  calibration  and  the  vehicle checked for adequate braking ability. Remove aircraft arresting cables to prevent damage to equipment. 5.4.4.2.  Location  of  Friction  Surveys  on  the  Runway.  When  conducting  friction surveys on the runway(s) at 40 miles per hour (mph) (65 kilometers per hour [km/h]), the operator  should  begin  recording  data  at  the  threshold  when  adequate  overruns  with  in-ground lighting are present.  If the length of the overrun is such that the operator cannot accelerate to speed before crossing the threshold, then data should be collected as soon as the  vehicle  reaches  40  mph  (65  km/h).  The  friction  survey  should  be  terminated approximately 500 feet (152 meters) from the opposite end of the runway if the length of the overrun is not adequate for the operator to use the overrun for deceleration; otherwise, the survey should be terminated at the threshold. When conducting friction surveys on the runway(s) at 60 mph (97 km/h), the operator should begin recording data at the threshold when adequate overruns with in-ground lighting are present. If the length of the overrun is  such  that  the  operator  cannot  accelerate  to  speed  before  crossing  the  threshold,  then data  should  be  collected  as  soon  as  the  vehicle  reaches  60  mph  (97  km/h).  The  friction survey should be terminated approximately 1,000 feet (305 meters) from the opposite end of  the  runway  if  the  length  of  the  overrun  is  not  adequate  for  the  operator  to  use  the overrun  for  deceleration;  otherwise,  the  survey  should  be  terminated  at  the  threshold. Where travel beyond the end of the runway or overrun could result in equipment damage or personal injury, additional runway length should be allowed for stopping. The lateral location on the runway for performing the tests should be 10 and 20 feet (3 and 6 meters) from  the  centerline.  Unless  surface  conditions  are  noticeably  different  on  either  side  of the  runway  centerline,  a  test  on  one  side  of  the  centerline  in  the  same  direction  the aircraft  lands  should  be  sufficient;  however,  when  both  ends  of  the  runway  are  to  be evaluated, vehicle runs can be made to record data on the return trip (both ways). 38 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 5.4.4.3.  Vehicle Speed for Conducting Surveys.  FAA-approved CFME can be used at either  40  or  60  mph  (65  or  97  km/h).  The  lower  speed  determines  the  overall macrotexture/contaminant/drainage condition of the pavement surface. The higher speed provides an indication of the condition of the surface’s microtexture. A complete survey should include tests at both speeds. 5.4.4.4.  Use  of  CFME  Self-Wetting  System.  Since  wet  pavement  always  yields  the lowest friction measurements, the CFME should be equipped with a self-wetting system to  simulate  worst  case  conditions.  Self-wetting  systems  simulate  rain  to  produce  wet pavement surface conditions and provide the operator with a continuous record of friction values along the length of the runway. The attached nozzle(s) are designed to provide a uniform water depth of 0.04 inch (1 mm) in front of the  friction measuring tire(s). This wetted  surface  produces  friction  values  that  are  the  most  meaningful  in  determining whether or not corrective action is needed. 5.4.4.5.  Friction  Level  Classification.  Mu  (µ)  numbers  (friction  values)  measured  by CFME  can  be  used  as  guidelines  for  evaluating  the  surface  friction  deterioration  of runway  pavements  and  for  identifying  the  appropriate  corrective  actions  necessary  for safe aircraft operations. Table 3-2 of FAA AC 150/5320-12C depicts the friction values for three  classification levels  for FAAqualified CFME operated at  40- and 60-mph  (65- and  97-km/h)  test  speeds.  This  table  was  developed  from  qualification  and  correlation tests conducted at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility. 5.4.4.6.  Evaluation  and  Maintenance  Guidelines.  The  evaluation  and  maintenance guidelines in the following subparagraphs are recommended based on the friction levels classified in Table 3-2 of FAA AC 150/5320-12C. These guidelines take into account that poor friction conditions for short distances on the runway do not pose a safety problem to aircraft,  but  long  stretches  of  slippery  pavement  are  of  serious  concern  and  require prompt remedial action. 5.4.4.6.1.  Friction Deterioration Below the Maintenance Planning Friction Level (500  feet  [152  meters]).  When the average Mu  value on the wet  runway pavement surface  at  both  40  and  60  mph  (65  and  97  km/h)  is  less  than  the  Maintenance Planning Friction Level but above the Minimum Friction Level in Table 3-2 of FAA AC 150/5320-12C for a distance of 500 feet (152 meters), and the adjacent 500-foot (152-meter)  segments  are  at  or  above  the  Maintenance  Planning  Friction  Level,  no corrective  action  is  required.  These  readings  indicate  that  the  pavement  friction  is deteriorating but the situation is still within an acceptable overall condition. 5.4.4.6.2.  Friction Deterioration Below the Maintenance Planning Friction Level (1000 feet [305 meters]).  When the average Mu value on the wet runway pavement surface  at  both  40  and  60  mph  (65  and  97  km/h)  is  less  than  the  Maintenance Planning  Friction  Level  in  Table  3-2  of  FAA  AC  150/5320-12C  for  a  distance  of 1,000  feet  (305  meters)  or  more,  an  extensive  evaluation  should  be  conducted  to determine the causes and extent of the friction deterioration. If the surface has rubber buildup, the airfield manager should submit a work request  to  have rubber removed from the affected areas of the runway. 5.4.4.6.3.  Friction  Deterioration  Below  the  Minimum  Friction  Level.  When  the average  Mu  value  on  the  wet  pavement  surface  at  both  40  and  60  mph  (65  and  97 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 39 km/h) is below the Minimum Friction Level in Table 3-2 of FAA AC 150/5320-12C for  a  distance  of  500  feet  (152  meters),  and  the  adjacent  500-foot  (152-meter) segments are below the Maintenance Planning Friction Level, action should be taken immediately  to  correct  the  affected  areas  of  the  runway.  Before  undertaking corrective  measures,  inspect  the  overall  condition  of  the  entire  runway  pavement surface to determine if other deficiencies exist that may require additional corrective action. 5.4.4.6.4.  Additional  Testing  Requirements.  Texture  and  slope  (longitudinal  and transverse) measurements should be taken if less than optimal Mu values result from CFME testing. Rubber build-up can also be categorized by using classifications found in  Figure  5.1.  This  additional  information  will  assist  in  the  determination  of  the appropriate corrective action needed to restore surface friction characteristics. Figure 5.1.  Estimation of Rubber Deposits.  40 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 Chapter 6 TESTING OF POWER CHECK PAD ANCHORING SYSTEMS 6.1.  Background.  Most Air Force fighter aircraft use aircraft anchoring systems during power checks  and  routine  maintenance  procedures.  When  requested  by  the  MAJCOMs,  AFCEC  tests anchors  to  determine  their  capability  to  safely  support  the  loads  imposed  by  these  aircraft. AFCEC tests only existing power check pad anchors that were originally designed to withstand loads associated with F-4 operations: AFCEC does not test Hush House anchors or high-capacity trim-pad  anchors.  If  new  high-capacity  trim-pad  anchors  are  constructed  as  specified  in applicable  UFCs  or  Engineering  Technical  Letters  (ETLs),  testing  is  not  required;  however,  if there  are  quality  concerns,  proof  loading  to  ensure  that  new  anchors  meet  operational requirements  should  be  included  in  the  project  documents.  Emergency  requests  for  testing  of new  anchors  must  be  approved  by  the  AFCEC  Director  and  requires  funding  by  the MAJCOM/base.  (T-1).  Equipment  and  inspection  and  testing  procedures  are  detailed  in Appendix G of UFC 3-260-03. The base provides a forklift or crane for the tests. 6.2.  Testing Schedule.  AFCEC develops an annual anchor testing program based on MAJCOM requirements. The annual data call process is described in section 4.3. 6.3.  Anchor  Testing  Report.  After  completion  of  field  testing  and  data  analysis,  AFCEC publishes an anchor testing report. The report documents the equipment and procedures used to test the anchors and includes proof load data. Usage recommendations are provided based on the anchors performance during the proof-load test. Examples of the recorded data and the affidavit are provided in UFC 3-260-03, Appendix G. 6.4.  Report Distribution.  AFCEC distributes the anchor test report to the appropriate base and MAJCOMs and maintains files at AFCEC. AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 41 Chapter 7 PAVEMENT CONDITION INDEX SURVEY PROGRAM 7.1.  Program  Management.  AFCEC  manages  the  Air  Force  pavement  condition  index  (PCI) survey program. Responsibilities include maintaining files of all previous PCI survey reports for each  base,  maintaining  contracts  for  conducting  PCI  surveys,  funding,  scheduling,  and monitoring  contract  PCIs,  performing  quality  assurance,  and  updating  the  PAVER  pavement management system and applicable reference documents. 7.1.1.  CETSC  manages  the  Air  Force  pavement  condition  index  (PCI)  survey  program  for ANG  locations.  Responsibilities  include  maintaining  PCI  survey  reports,  conducts  PCI surveys,  and  updates  the  PAVER  pavement  management  system  and  applicable  reference documents. 7.1.2.  CETSC provides PCI survey reports and updated PAVER management system files to AFCEC upon completion. 7.2.  Reference Documents.  PCI surveys are accomplished in accordance with the most current version of the following documents: 7.2.1.  ASTM D5340 and UFC 3-260-16FA, Airfield Condition Survey Procedures. 7.2.2.  ASTM  D6433,  Standard  Practice  for  Roads  and  Parking  Lots  Pavement  Condition Index Surveys. 7.2.3.  ASTM  E1926,  Standard  Practice  for  Computing  International  Roughness  Index  of Roads  from  Longitudinal  Profile  Measurements  when  surveys  are  conducted  using automated inspection systems. 7.3.  Contract  Procedure.  AFCEC  publishes  an  updated  16-year  PCI  survey  schedule  in  an annual  call  letter.    Bases  can  request  changes  to  the  schedule  by  responding  to  the  call  and providing  justification  for  the  change.  Once  the  PCI  survey  schedule  is  updated,  AFCEC develops  the  statement  of  work,  government  cost  estimates,  and  other  contracting  documents.  After receiving funding, the AFCEC program manager (PM) works with the contracting officer to award a task order under a pre-negotiated contract. The PM works with both the customer and the contractor to ensure that the contractor has the latest structural pavement evaluation data and other required information. AFCEC coordinates the overall survey schedule with the bases, and once  confirmed,  monitors  progress  and  addresses  any  issues  raised  by  the  base  or  contractor.  Once the draft report is published, the PM reviews it for technical and contractual adequacy and works  with  the  contractor  and  base  to  reconcile  issues,  ensure  that  applicable  comments  are incorporated, and ensure that the effort is completed within schedule. 7.4.  Report  Content.  The  statement  of  work  outlines  the  content  required  in  the  report.  The PM works with the AFCEC Airfield Pavement Evaluation (APE) team, contractors, and Reserve PCI teams to ensure that reports are structured the same and meet current standards for content. 7.4.1.  Field Survey Inbrief.  Provide an entry briefing to the BCE project officer and other base  officials,  as  arranged  by  the  project  officer.  This  inbrief  should  explain  the  survey procedures and describe the base support needed to complete the evaluation. 42 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 7.4.2.  Field Survey Outbrief.  Provide an exit briefing to the BCE project officer and other base officials, as arranged by the project officer. This outbrief should summarize the survey results and provide a general impression of pavement maintenance requirements. 7.4.3.  Reports.  The  survey  team  produces  a  report  for  the  airfield  and/or  road  network according to the statement of work for contracts and according to current report standards for the  APE  or  Reserve  Teams.  Contractors  shall  deliver,  the  report  in  hard  copy  and  pdf,  the PAVER database, all mapping for the survey, the PAVER database, all photo documentation, and  all  source  documents  created  for  the  report.    All  reports  are  stored  on  the  AFCEC network drive and the report pdf, mapping, and database are posted on the AFCEC Pavement Report  Website  at  https://tyndall.eim.acc.hedc.af.mil/apps/afcec/Pavement%20Reports/default.aspx.  The final reports must also be established as part of the official records file plan. (T-0). AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 43 Chapter 8 PAVEMENT ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT STANDARDS 8.1.  EA  for  Airfields.  An  EA  is  used  to  help  prioritize  or  rank  proposed  M&R  pavement projects. The components of the EA are also used in the Transportation and Airfield Pavements (TNAP) business rules to compute the probability of failure (PoF) which is in turn used to score / prioritize projects on the integrated priority list (IPL). 8.1.1.  EA  Criteria.  Apply  the  criteria  in  section  8.1.5  to  determine  or  validate  a section/branch rating of Adequate, Degraded, or Unsatisfactory. 8.1.2.  Project  Priorities.  Apply the criteria in section 8.1.6 to set priorities for projects on sections/branches within each impact rating category. 8.1.3.  Numerical  Rating  System.  The  criteria  in  section  8.1.8  can  be  used  to  establish  a numerical  rating for pavement systems  or entire  airfields to  allow comparison  throughout  a MAJCOM and to assess the potential impact of projects. 8.1.4.  Rating  Factors.  The  factors  used  to  determine  EAs  or  ratings  are  the  PCI,  Friction Index (runway pavements only), Structural Index, and Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Index. 8.1.4.1.  PCI.  The  PCI  is  a  numerical  rating  (on  a  scale  of  0  to  100)  determined  by  a visual pavement survey based on procedures in ASTM D5340, ASTM D6433, and UFC 3-260-16FA. Refer to the most current version of the ASTM publications. 8.1.4.1.1.  This  AFI  establishes  a  standard  color  code  for  the  seven  condition  codes described  in  ASTM  D5340  and  also  for  corresponding  simplified  and  cursory  PCI rating system used when performing contingency evaluations. Air Force PCI surveys are  typically  conducted  to  the  95%  confidence  level  and  uses  the  seven-tier  rating system depicted in Figure 8.1.  A simplified PCI uses the same seven-tier scale, but only  requires  the  minimum  number  of  sample  units  outlined  in  the  ASTM.    The cursory  survey  is  based  on  a  representative  sample  that  is  less  than  the  minimum outlined in the ASTM and uses Good, Fair, and Poor rating categories. 8.1.4.1.2.  Table  8.1.  provides  a  more  detailed  description  of  the  PCI  rating categories and their associated distress levels and probable maintenance requirements.  Figure  8.1. shows the standard/simplified and cursory PCI rating scales.    Table  8.1 and Table 8.2 describe the PCI ratings and associated M&R required to increase the PCI.  Table 8.3 displays the EA ratings and associated PCI values.   44 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 Figure 8.1.  PCI and Simplified PCI Rating Scales.

PCI Index 71–100 56–70 0–55 EA Rating Adequate Degraded Unsatisfactory 8.1.4.2.  Friction  Index.  AFCEC conducts tests to determine the friction characteristics of runways and compiles the results in a runway friction characteristics report for a given base.  Chapter  5  of  this  AFI  outlines  the  details  of  when  and  how  these  tests  are conducted and reports.  The Friction Index for a section is equal to the Friction Index of the segment comprising the section. If the section is composed of more than one segment, assign  the  lowest  of  the  segment  friction  indices  to  the  section.  Based  on  the  Friction Index assigned to the section, a corresponding friction rating can be assigned using Table 8.4,  which  correlates  friction  indices  from  different  friction  measuring  equipment  to friction ratings. The friction ratings in Table 8.4 are to be used to rank and compare projects and do not correspond to the guidance in FAA AC 150/5320-12C. Because rubber  deposits  can  lower  the  measured  friction  values,  the  truest  measure  of  a pavement’s  friction  characteristics  is  obtained  if  testing  is  accomplished  shortly  after completion  of  rubber  removal.  Therefore,  to  the  maximum  extent  possible,  friction testing should be scheduled as soon as possible following completion of a rubber removal project.   46 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 Table 8.4.

ICAO: International Civil Aviation Organization index of friction characteristics 10.  A wet runway produces a drop in friction with an increase in speed. If the runway has good texture, allowing the water  to  escape  beneath  the  tire,  then  friction  values  are  less  affected  by  speed.  Conversely,  a  poorly  textured surface  produces  a  larger  drop  in  friction  with  an  increase  in  speed.  Friction  characteristics  can  be  further reduced by poor drainage due to inadequate slopes or depressions in the runway surface. 8.1.4.3.  Structural  Index.  The  Structural  Index  is  a  ratio  of  Aircraft  Classification Number of the critical aircraft that operates on the airfield to the Pavement Classification Number  (ACN/PCN)  for  a  section.  The  ACN  represents  the  impact  a  particular  aircraft has  on  the  pavement.  The  PCN  represents  the  capability  of  the  pavement  to  support  an aircraft.  AFCEC  conducts  structural  evaluations  for  Air  Force  bases  and  for  each evaluation publishes an airfield pavement evaluation report containing the PCN for each pavement  section.  The  airfield  pavement  evaluation  report  also  contains  ACN  data  on certain  aircraft  (i.e.,  critical  aircraft  from  each  of  the  standard  aircraft  group  indices  as defined  in  Chapter  4).  Additional  ACN  data  are  available  from  AFCEC’s  Aircraft Characteristics for Airfield Pavement Design and Evaluation report; USACE ETL 1110-3-394,  Aircraft  Characteristics  for  Airfield-Heliport  Design  and  Evaluation;  FAA  AC 150/5335-5, Standardized Method of Reporting Airport Pavement Strength PCN; and the Pavement-Transportation Computer Assisted Structural  Engineering (PCASE) computer AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 47 program. Data from the latest AFCEC airfield pavement evaluation report can be used to determine  the  Structural  Index  and  corresponding  structural  rating  for  each  pavement section. (Note:  Do not  compute a Structural  Index for overruns.)  Different  aircraft may be used to determine the ACN for different sections based on a base’s mission and traffic patterns.  An  ACN/PCN  ratio  less  than  1.10  is  classified  as  Good,  a  ratio  between  1.10 and  1.40  is  classified  as  Fair,  and  a  ratio  greater  than  1.4  is  classified  as  Poor.  The structural ratings of each section can be displayed on a color-coded airfield layout map, using  green  for  the  corresponding  rating  of  Good,  yellow  for  Fair,  and  red  for  Poor. These ratios and ratings are to be used for comparison and prioritization only; they are not to be used to determine and report capability to support aircraft. Note: Some airfield pavement evaluation reports contain two sets of PCN values, one for normal conditions and one for the frost-melt or thaw-weakened period. In such instances, the Structural Index determination should be based on the reported PCN values for normal conditions. is  determined  from 8.1.4.4.  FOD  Index.  A  FOD  Index  can  be  determined  using  the  PCI  survey  data.  The FOD  Index the distresses/severity levels capable of producing FOD as presented in Tables 8.4 and  8.5. In  calculating  the  PCI  for  determining  the  FOD  Index,  note  that  a  multiplier,  or modification  factor,  of  0.6  is  applied  to  the  deduct  value  for  alligator  cracking,  and  a multiplier,  or  modification  factor,  of  4.0  is  applied  to  the  deduct  value  for  joint  seal damage. The FOD Index equals (100−PCIFOD) and can be calculated using PAVER. the  PCI  calculated  by  considering  only Table 8.5.  Distress List for ACC Pavements.

FOD Potential  Rating Scale.  A FOD Potential Rating scale ranging from 0 to 100  can  be  used  to  indicate  the  potential  for  FOD  problems.  Figure  8.2.  shows  a numerical  FOD  Potential  Rating  scale  and  corresponding  descriptive  categories.  The FOD  Potential  Rating  depends  on  the  type  of  aircraft  using  the  pavement,  the  type  of pavement surface (asphalt or concrete), and the FOD Index. The FOD Index and the FOD Potential  Rating  should be  determined  from  the  most  current  PCI  survey.  Relationships between FOD indices and FOD potential ratings have been developed for F-16, KC-135, and C-17 aircraft; Figures 8.3. and  8.4. show these relationships for asphalt and concrete pavements,  respectively.  These  three  aircraft  were  selected  as  a  representative  cross section in regards to engine height above the pavement surface and engine susceptibility to FOD (e.g., engine type, size, air flow, thrust). Table 8.7. shows the FOD Index ranges corresponding to the FOD Potential Ratings of Good, Fair, and Poor, as determined from Figures  8.3.  and    8.4.  Table  8.8  provides  recommendations  on  which  standard  aircraft curve (i.e., F-16, KC-135, or C-17) to use when determining the FOD Potential Ratings for other  aircraft. Different  aircraft curves may  be used to  determine the FOD Potential Ratings  for  different  sections  based  on  a  base’s  mission  and  traffic  patterns.  The  FOD Potential Ratings can be displayed on a color-coded airfield layout map, using green for the corresponding rating of Good, yellow for Fair, and red for Poor. AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 49 Figure 8.2.

Determining the EA.  This section describes a procedure for determining the EA for any  airfield  pavement  section  or  branch  (i.e.,  runway,  apron,  or  taxiway)  based  on  four factors: PCI, Friction Index (runway pavements only), Structural Index, and FOD Index. 8.1.5.1.  Step  One:  Determine  Indices.  Determine  the  appropriate  PCI,  Friction  Index (runway pavements only), Structural Index, and FOD Index for each pavement section. 8.1.5.1.1.  PCI.  Review the most recent airfield PCI survey report and determine the PCI  for  each  pavement  section.  Rate  the  section  in  accordance  with  Figure  8.1  and the instructions in paragraph 8.1.4.1. 8.1.5.1.2.  Friction  Index.  Review the  most  recent  AFCEC  runway  friction characteristics  report  for  the  base  to  determine  the  skid/hydroplaning  potential  of runway pavements. Divide the runway into 500-foot-long (152-meter-long) segments and  determine  the  Friction  Index  of  each  segment.  Correlate  the  segments  to pavement  sections  and  determine  the  Friction  Index  for  each  section.  Rate  the sections in accordance with Table 8.4 and the instructions in paragraph 8.1.4.2. 8.1.5.1.3.  Structural Index.  Review the latest AFCEC airfield pavement evaluation report  for  the  base  and  determine  the  Structural  Index  of  each  section.  When performing ACN/PCN calculations, use an ACN for the most critical mission aircraft on  a  given  section  at  the  aircraft’s  standard  takeoff  weight  and  the  published  PCN based  on  50,000  passes  of  a  C-17.  (Note:  Different  aircraft  may  be  used  in  the calculations for different sections, such as when  a particular section is  used only by fighter  aircraft  while  other  sections  receive  a  mix  of  traffic  that  includes  heavier aircraft.)  Rate  the  section  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  in  paragraph  8.1.4.3. Base  engineers  should  consult  with  Base  Operations  to  determine  the  critical mission aircraft and standard takeoff weight. 8.1.5.1.4.  FOD  Index.  Determine  the  FOD  Index  using  the  PCI  survey  data.  The FOD  Index  is  determined  from  the  PCI  calculated  by  considering  only  the distresses/severity  levels  capable  of  producing  FOD.  Determine  the  FOD  Potential Rating for each pavement section based on the appropriate aircraft and in accordance with  Figures  8.3.  and    8.4.,  Table  8.7.,  and  the  instructions  in  paragraph  8.1.4.4. (Note:  Different  aircraft  may  be  used  in  determining  the  FOD  Potential  Ratings  for 52 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 different sections, such as when a particular section is used only for parking transport aircraft while other sections receive fighter aircraft.). 8.1.5.2.  Step  Two:  Determine  EAs  for  Each  Airfield  Section.  EAs  of  Adequate, Degraded, or Unsatisfactory are assigned to each airfield section based on the criteria in Table 8.9. All rating factors meet the criteria; i.e., if all factors do not meet the criteria, the  section  rating  is  assigned  based  on  the  lowest  factor  rating.  For  example,  a  runway section would be rated Adequate only if the PCI is > 71; and the Friction Index is > 0.49; and the Structural  Index (ACN/PCN) is less than 1.10;  and the FOD Potential Rating is   < 45. Table 8.9.  EA Criteria. Assessment/Rating Category PCI Friction Index (Runway Pavements Only) Structural Index FOD Potential Rating Adequate 71–100 > 0.49* < 1.10 0–45 Degraded 56–70 0.34–0.49* 1.10–1.40 46–60 Unsatisfactory 0–55 < 0.34* > 1.40 61–100 *Applies to GripTester at 40 mph (65 km/h) only. For other testing equipment, use the values corresponding to the ratings of Good, Fair, and Poor in Table 8.4. 8.1.5.3.  Step  Three:  Determine  the  EA  for  a  Branch  or  Project  Requirement.  The EA  can  be  determined  for  a  branch  or  project  requirement  by  computing  the  weighted area  average  PCI  for  the  branch  or  project,  Friction  Index  (runway  pavements  only), Structural Index, and FOD Potential Rating (optional) for each section and comparing the values to the criteria in Table 8.9. An example of computing a weighted average PCI is shown in section 8.1.8. Table 8.10 shows an example of computing an EA for a runway, where  Section  R01A  is  150  by  1000  feet  (46  by  305  meters),  Section  R02C  is  150  by 8000 feet (46 by 2,438 meters), Section R03A is 150 by 500 feet (46 by 152 meters), and Section R04A is 150 by 500 feet (46 by 152 meters). Comparing the weighted values in Table  8.10  to  the  criteria  in  Table  8.9,  the  EA  for  the  runway  is  Degraded,  the  lowest rating of the four factors. Note: The weighted average Structural Index can result in a Degraded or Unsatisfactory rating for a branch or project even though the PCI and other factors are rated Adequate. In this situation, examine the individual Degraded section(s) to determine if they can support the mission requirements. (Use the AGLs table in the latest AFCEC pavement evaluation report.) If the mission requirements are met, rate the branch/project as Adequate.   AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 53 Table 8.10.  EA Example.

Step  Four:  Report  the  EAs  by  Section  and  Branch.  It is also recommended that the results be displayed on a color-coded airfield layout plan, with  green indicating Adequate,  yellow  indicating  Degraded,  and  red  indicating  Unsatisfactory  sections.  An example  airfield  layout  plan  illustrating  EAs  by  section  is  shown  in  Figure  8.5,  while EAs by branch (i.e., based on weighted section values) are shown in Figure 8.6. Figure 8.5.  Sample Airfield Layout Plan Rated by Section.  54 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 Figure 8.6.  Sample Airfield Layout Plan Rated by Branch.  8.1.6.  Project  Prioritization.  The  following  procedure  outlines  a  method  for  objectively establishing priorities for projects that fall into the same assessment category (i.e., Adequate, Degraded, or Unsatisfactory). 8.1.6.1.  Procedure.  Determine  the  PCI,  Friction  Index,  Structural  Index,  and  FOD Potential  Rating  (optional)  for  the  section  related  to  each  project.  Use  Figure  8.7.  to determine the deduct values for  the Friction  Index, Structural  Index, and FOD Potential Rating  (optional).  Friction  deduct  charts  are  shown  for  both  the  Mu-Meter  and  the GripTester. These deduct values may be capped at a maximum value of 10 for data that falls  outside  the  ranges  of  values  depicted.  Subtract  each  deduct  value  from  the  PCI  to determine a priority order (lowest numerical result ranks first in priority). 8.1.6.2.  Example.  Assume that three runway sections fall within the Degraded category as  determined  by  the  criteria  in  Table  8.9.  Pertinent  information  for  determining  the section project prioritization for this example is shown in Table 8.11. AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 55 Figure 8.7.  Deduct Values for Friction Index, Structural Index, and FOD Potential Rating.    56 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 Table 8.11.  Determining Funding Priority.

Combining  Sections.  When  sections  are  combined  to  form  projects,  use  an  area-weighted  process  for  determining  the  rating.  For  instance,  if  Sections  R12A  and  R13A  in Table 8.11. were included in a single project, the combined rating would be: Rating (Combined) = Rating R12A(Area R12A) + Rating R13A(Area R13A) Area R12A + Area R13A 8.1.8.  Numerical  Rating  System.  This process  can be used to  rate the general  “health” of all  facilities,  including  pavements,  on  a  numerical  rating  scale.  This  section  describes  a procedure  for  calculating  a  pavement  rating  using  a  weighted  PCI.  A  weighted  PCI  can  be calculated manually or by using PAVER: 8.1.8.1.  Assume  a  10,000-  by  150-foot  (3,048-  by  46-meter)  runway  comprised  of  the sections described in Table 8.12. Table 8.12.  Numerical Rating System Example. Section  Dimensions R21A R22C R23A R24A 1,000 by 150 feet (305 by 46 meters) 8,000 by 150 feet (2,438 by 46 meters) 500 by 150 feet (152 by 46 meters) 500 by 150 feet (152 by 46 meters) PCI 78 70 54 52 8.1.8.2.

Assessing Value Added.  The procedure above can also be used to determine “value added”  to  a  facility  by  a  project.  For  example,  assume  an  M&R  project  raises  the  PCI  of R23A  and  R24A  to  80  without  affecting  any  of  the  other  indices.  The  new  rating  for  the runway  would  be  71.8;  therefore,  the  project  increased  the  health  of  the  runway  by  2.8 points. 8.1.10.  Rating  Scales.  It  is  possible  to  adjust  the  scale  for  rating  facility  health.  For example,  using  a  range  of  85  to  100  for  the  rating  of  Good  may  be  desirable.  This  can  be accomplished by applying a proportioning operation to the weighted PCI (see Table 8.13.). Table 8.13.  Proportioning Operation Applied to the Weighted PCI.  58 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 Chapter 9 ASSET MANAGEMENT 9.1.  Background.  The  goal  of  Asset  Management  is  to  effectively  manage  infrastructure. AFPD  32-10  states  that  the  Air  Force  will  “provide  and  retain  the  minimum  number  of installations and facilities necessary to effectively support Air Force missions and people at the lowest  life-cycle  cost  and  in  a  sustainable  way...”    To  accomplish  this  goal,  infrastructure  was divided  into  five  activities:  transportation  networks,  utilities,  facilities,  waste  management,  and natural  infrastructure.  The  transportation  networks  include  airfield  and  roadway  pavements, vehicle parking areas, curbs and gutters, bridges, sidewalks, airfield and traffic markings, signals and signs, rails, docks, and piers. 9.2.  Activity  Management  Plan  (AMP).  AMPs  are  developed  for  each  major  CE  activity  to include Transportation and Airfield Pavement (TNAP) Networks. AMPs include information on Real  Property  inventory,  Levels  of  Service  (LOS),  Key  Performance  Indicators  (KPI),  and  the planned  investments  (projects/requirements)  identified  to  achieve  the  required  LOS.  The Pavement  Management  Plan  (PMP)  is  a  component  of  the  AMP  that  outlines  the  maintenance and  repair  requirement  for  all  base  pavements.  The  PMP  will  have  subcomponents  for  both airfields and for roads and parking pavements.  Both of these plans can be simply expressed as a document that specifies the following to inform base leadership: a)  When maintenance or repair is needed. b)  What maintenance or repair activities are to be performed. c)  How the work is to be accomplished. d)  What is the cost for the work and what is the risk if the work is not accomplished. At a minimum, the PMP includes a prioritized list of work requirements and projects for execution in-house or by contract with location, quantity, estimated cost, and the benefit / risk associated with performing or not performing the work. 9.3.  Developing  the  PMP.  As  described  in  Chapter  2,  AFCEC  has  the  responsibility  to centrally fund and manage the structural evaluation and PCI survey program for the Air Force. AFRC  supports  AFRC  owned  installations  and  CETSC  supports  ANG  owned  installations  in development of Pavement Management Plans (PMP). This program collects the bulk of the data base civil engineers need to develop PMPs.   The PMP starts with a list of pavement maintenance and  repair  requirements  from  the  AFCEC  report.    The  PCI  generated  by  PAVER  (the  DoD’s pavement  management  system)  and  the  Engineering  Assessment  data  from  the  report  are  the core  elements  that  base  engineers  use  to  identify  and  prioritize  these  requirements.    The  base uses  this  data  in  conjunction  with  the  structural  pavement  evaluation  and  construction  history data  to  translate  these  prioritized  requirements  into  properly  scoped  in-house  work  plans  and projects for contract execution to implement the PMP. 9.4.  Pavement  Maintenance  and  Repair  Categories.  The  terminology  traditionally  used  to describe pavement maintenance and repair is a bit different than used for other asset types, which sometimes causes confusion.   Following are definitions for each category: 9.4.1.  Preventive  Maintenance.  This  is  a  program  of  activities  that  preserves  the investment in pavements, reduces the rate of degradation due to specific distresses, extends pavement  life,  enhances  pavement  performance,  and  reduces  mission  impact.    Preventive AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 59 Maintenance includes  Localized  Preventive  Maintenance  and  Global  Preventive Maintenance.    Both  are  performed  on  pavements  that  are  above  the  Critical  PCI  and  are intended to maintain good pavements in good condition, at minimal cost. 9.4.1.1.  Localized  Preventive  Maintenance  .    Localized  PM  consists  of  maintenance actions performed on pavement at the location of individual distresses to slow down the rate  of  pavement  deterioration.    It  differs  from  global  preventive  maintenance  in  that  it typically is not applied to pavement outside of the location of the distress, whereas global preventive maintenance is applied to areas of the pavement that may not be distressed. 9.4.1.2.  Global  Preventive  Maintenance.  Global  PM  is  used  to  retard  or  slow pavement deterioration.  Generally, global PM is effective at the beginning of pavement life,  and/or  when  the  climatic-caused  distresses  have  not  started  (or,  in  some  cases,  the severity  is  low  or  medium).        Global  PM  may  be  performed  in  response  to  the appearance or progression of distress like Localized Maintenance, but is more commonly performed  on  a  recurring  schedule  (i.e.,  at  set  time  intervals)  without  regard  for  the distresses present. Examples of global PM include Micro- Surfacing, Slurry Seals, or Fog Seals. 9.4.2.  Major Maintenance and Repair (M&R).  This is defined as activities applied to the entire  pavement  section  to  correct  or  improve  existing  surface  or  structural  conditions  to meet  functional  requirements.    Major  M&R  includes  work  like  mill  and  overlay,  structural overlays,  selective  slab  replacement,  and  reconstruction.    Traditionally  it  was  assumed  that the PCI value would be  100 after major M&R which is  true for asphalt pavements, but  not necessarily  for  concrete  pavement.    The  current  definition  assumes  the  PCI  will  improve significantly, but not necessarily take it back to 100.  The two categories of Major M&R are: 9.4.2.1.  Major M&R above critical  PCI.  This is typically done to address a structural deficiency or some other operational issue.  This option is rarely used; typically we will continue to do localized preventive maintenance at least until we reach the critical PCI to maximize the useful life of the existing pavement. 9.4.2.2.  Major  M&R  below  critical  PCI.  This  is  done  after  a  pavement  reaches  the critical PCI.  A pavement condition that has gone past the critical PCI has not failed and is  still  functional,  but  the  effectiveness  of  preventive  (operational)  maintenance  is diminished and less cost-effective. 9.4.3.  Operational  Maintenance.  This  is  also  referred  to  as  safety  maintenance,  stop-gap maintenance,  and  breakdown  maintenance.    Operational  Maintenance  is  performed  to mitigate distresses on pavements that are below the Critical PCI to keep them operationally safe  for  use.  The  type  of  work  performed  is  the  same  as  what  is  done  for  preventive maintenance. 9.5.  Critical  PCI.  This  is  the  PCI  value  of  a  section  at  which  the  rate  of  deterioration significantly  increases  and  cost  effectiveness  (return  on  investment)  of  preventive  maintenance decreases.    Critical  PCI  will  depend  on  pavement  type,  pavement  use,  traffic  level,  and  repair costs and is unique for each base.  In 2016, PAVER is being configured to calculate the Critical PCI  for  each  pavement  section.    Until  this  capability  is  in  place,  the  Air  Force  will  continue using  a  PCI  of  70  as  the  default  Critical  PCI  for  primary  pavements  and  55  for  secondary  and tertiary pavements. 60 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 9.6.  Pavement  Rank.  This  is  used  to  more  accurately  establish  the  priority  of  requirements.  Pavement sections are assigned a rank of primary, secondary, and tertiary, or unused depending on  how  they  are  used  and  their  criticality  to  the  mission.    Pavement  ranks  are  established  by AFCEC  and  the  base  for  each  pavement  section  according  to  the  definitions  outlined  below.  Ranks for road and parking pavements relate to road categories outlined in Surface Deployment and  Distribution  Command  (SDDC)  Manual  on  Uniform  Traffic  Control  Devices.    Pavement ranks  are  used  to  adjust  the  MDI  for  use  in  prioritizing  requirements  and  computing  the Consequence  of  Failure  (CoF)  which  is  in  turn  used  to  prioritize  projects  on  the  Integrated Priority List (IPL).  Strict implementation of these rankings is critical to the ability to stratify and prioritize requirements and projects.  The current version of the TNAP Business Rules which is available  at  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/ceportal/CEPlaybooks/AFCAMP/Pages/default.aspx, outlines specific adjustment factors and computation process. 9.6.1.  Primary  airfield  pavements.  These  are  mission-essential  pavements  such  as runways, parallel taxiways, main parking aprons, arm-disarm pads, alert aircraft pavements, and  overruns  (when  used  as  a  taxiway  or  for  takeoff).    In  general,  only  pavements  that  are used by assigned aircraft on a daily basis are considered primary. 9.6.2.  Primary road and parking pavements.  These include arterials which are defined as a class of street serving a major movement of traffic not served by a freeway.  This includes installation roads and streets that serve as the main distributing arteries for traffic originating outside  and  within  an installation  and  that  provide  access  to,  thru,  and  between  the  various functional  areas  or  collector  or  local  streets  that  service  mission  critical  facilities. Classification  of  vehicle  parking  areas  as  primary  pavements  should  be  restricted  to  those areas associated with access to mission-essential facilities, such as alert facilities, munitions facilities, and medical facilities. 9.6.3.  Secondary  airfield  pavements.  These  are  not  used  on  a  daily  basis  by  assigned  or transient  aircraft.    Examples  include;  ladder  taxiways,  parking  areas  not  currently  used  by assigned  mission  aircraft,  overflow  parking  areas,  and  overruns  (when  there  is  an  aircraft arresting system present). In general, if a pavement is used by assigned or transient aircraft on a weekly basis, they should be considered secondary. 9.6.4.  Secondary road and parking pavements.  These include collector streets that gather and disperse traffic between the larger arterial highways and less important streets, that have intersections  at  grade,  and  that  are  equally  important  in  providing  traffic  movement  and access to abutting properties.  In addition, most parking areas that support daily traffic on a base are considered secondary pavements, unless a specific mission dictates otherwise. 9.6.5.  Tertiary  airfield  pavements.  These  include  infrequently  used  pavements  or  those used by towed aircraft, such as maintenance hangar access  aprons, aero club  parking, wash racks, and overruns (when not used as a taxiway or to test aircraft arresting gear). In general, any  pavement  that  does  not  support  aircraft  taxiing  under  their  own  power  or  is  used  on  a monthly basis is considered a tertiary pavement. 9.6.6.  Tertiary road and parking pavements.  These include local streets that are streets or roads primarily for access to residence, business or other abutting property. Installation roads and  streets  that  provide  access  from  other  collector  roads  and  streets  to  individual  units  of facilities of a functional area are included in this category.  Unsurfaced roads and abandoned in-place  but  usable  roads  are  classified  as  tertiary.    Any  parking  area  that  is  not  used  on  a AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 61 daily  basis  or  is  excess  to  the  standard  facilities  requirements  is  considered  a  tertiary pavement. 9.6.7.  Unused  pavements.  These  include  any  pavements  that  are  inactive,  abandoned  or scheduled for demolition. 9.7.  Rate  of  Pavement  Deterioration.  This  is  the  rate  at  which  a  specific  pavement  at  a specific location deteriorates over time.  This rate is dependent on climatic conditions, pavement use and traffic level.  Pavements at each base are grouped into families based on the pavement type,  rank,  and/or  use  in  PAVER  which  computes  deterioration  rates  (deterioration  family curves)  for  each  of  these  families.    These  deterioration  rates  are  used  to  predict  the  future condition  of  pavements.      An  example  family  curve  is  shown  below.    The  middle  green  curve represents  the  rate  of  deterioration;  the  outside  red  curves  represent  outlier  boundaries  which represent  1.96  Sigma  on  each  side  of  the  prediction  curve.    This  equates  to  95%  of  the  data points being within the prediction curve envelope. Figure 9.1.  Typical Family Curve.  9.8.  Work  Planning.  The PCI provides a key indicator of the level of maintenance and repair that should be accomplished.  The PMP should outline in-house M&R work to be performed or projects that should be programmed before the pavement reaches the conditions described below. a)  Sections with a PCI greater than or equal to 71 require preventive maintenance or minor M&R. b)  Sections with a PCI of 56 to 70 require major and/or minor M&R. c)  Sections with a PCI of 41 to 55 require major M&R or reconstruction. d)  Sections with a PCI below 40 generally require reconstruction although depending on the pavement rank and use, Major M&R may be used to prolong the life of the pavement. 9.9.  Localized  Preventive  Maintenance  and  Repair  Policies.  The  Air  Force  has  developed recommended localized maintenance and repair actions used to mitigate distresses and preserve airfield pavements above the Critical PCI as indicated in Tables A2.1 and  A2.2 and in Tables A2.3 and A2.4 for road and parking pavements.  These policies are implemented in PAVER in system tables and consider the severity and extent of observed distresses.  For example, using the PCI  pavement  distress  evaluation  terminology,  the  occurrence  of  joint  seal  damage  in  PCC pavements at the medium or high severity triggers the need for joint sealing.  62 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 9.10.  Global  Preventive  Maintenance  Policies.  Global  PM  is  used  to  retard  or  delay  large-scale pavement deterioration. Currently, global PM for the Air Force is limited to the application of  surface  treatments  to  asphalt  surfaces.  Surface  treatments  are  divided  into  two  general applications; fog seals/rejuvenators and slurry seals/microsurfacing.  Asphalt surface treatments include  spray-applied  materials  such  as  liquid-only  (fog  seals)  and  liquid/sand  mixtures.  Microsurfacing  and  slurry  seals  are  applied  using  a  mixing  unit  and  spreader  box.  When determining  the frequency  of  global  PM, the pavement's condition  should serve as the primary determining factor.  Generally, global  PM is  effective at  the beginning of pavement life and/or when  the  distress  severity  is  low.    When  used  correctly,  global  PM  prolongs  pavement  service life  but  the  benefits  can  vary  based  on  local  environmental  conditions  and  other  factors.  Local DOT or Airport practices can provide a good guide on the effectiveness of global maintenance. Following is a summary of global maintenance treatments installations should consider to extend the service life of pavements. Table 9.1.  Global Maintenance. Treatment Application Service Life Recommend AF Estimated Increased 4 -8 yrs depending on current condition of pavement Approximate Cost $3 to $6 per SY (50% to 75% of cost of overlay) 1 to 3 yrs for pavement in good condition $0.5 to $2 per SY Microsurfacing and Slurry Seals Roads and Parking Restorative (Fog) Seals Airfields and  Roads and Parking 9.11.  Requirements Prioritization:  the same rule set outlined in the TNAP Business rules for scoring  projects  can  be  used  to  prioritize  requirements.    The  Probability  of  Failure  (PoF)  and Consequence of Failure (CoF) are the components of a risk matrix that defines four categories of risk; High, Significant, Moderate, and Low.  Specifics can be found in the current version of the TNAP Business Rules. 9.11.1.  PoF:  The  PoF  is  determined  based  on  the  PCI  in  the  year  of  execution  with downward  adjustments  based  on  the  FOD  Potential  Rating,  Structural  Index,  and  Friction Index described in Chapter 8, Engineering Assessment. 9.11.2.  CoF  (Adjusted  MDI):  The  CoF  is  determined  by  the  Mission  Dependency  Index (MDI) of the facility.  A portion of the CoF value is determined based on MAJCOM input.  The  objective  portion  of  the  CoF  is  based  on  the  MDI,  which  is  determined  based  on  the category  code  for  the  facility.    However,  since  not  all  airfield  pavements  with  a  given category code are equally important, the MDI is adjusted using the pavement rank.  Primary pavements have a multiplier of 1.0, Secondary have a multiplier of 0.9, and Tertiary have a multiplier of 0.6.  Do not apply a multiplier for road and parking areas, just use the MDI. 9.11.3.  Savings  to Investment  Ratio  (SIR):  Using the PoF and CoF tends to place a high priority on pavements with a low condition rating and a high CoF (worst first).  One of the primary  tenants  of  asset  management  is  to  optimize  the  life  cycle  cost  of  a  facility  by investing  in  preventive  maintenance.    New  business  rules  are  in  development  to  place  an emphasis on keeping our good pavements good. AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 63 9.12.  Developing  the  Pavement  Management  Plan  .  PCI  reports  include  a  list  of  M&R requirements by section with a recommended year of execution based on the critical PCI, Branch Use, and Rank. This list of requirements will be prioritized using the PoF and Adjusted MDI as outlined  in  the  business  rules.  Current  (as  of  2015)  evaluation  reports  now  include  a  table summarizing  the  PoF  and  Adjusted  MDI  for  each  section.    However,  it  will  take  another  four years before all published reports include these products. In the interim, the following process for developing  the  PMP  from  the  tables  and  data  in  the  published  reports  can  be  used.  Note  that PAVER  is  being modified to  automate the PoF, Adjusted MDI, and SIR  computations in  2016 which should facilitate the process: 9.12.1.  Generate PoF and Adjusted MDI Table:  This table will list the PoF and Adjusted MDI  for  each  section.    Download  the  PoF  and  Adjusted  MDI  template  posted  on  the Transportation  and  Pavements  site  at  this  link:  https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-EN-CE-A6/24048/OO-EN-CE-55/default.aspx.  Fill in the template by copying and pasting the data from  Engineering  Assessment  (EA)  Table  in  the  report  into  the  PoF  and  Adjusted  MDI template.  Detailed  instructions  are  included  with  the  template.  Use  the  PoF  and  Adjusted MDI table to prioritize the sections that have the highest risk. 9.12.2.  Prioritize  Work  Requirements:  The PCI  report includes tables that provide  a list of  preventive,  global,  stop-gap,  and  major  maintenance  and  repair  requirements  for  each section  for  each  year.    Use  the  PoF  and  Adjusted  MDI  table  to  prioritize  these  work requirements based on level of risk for each section. 9.12.3.  Refine  Work  Requirements:  The extrapolated distress  report is  used to refine the list of requirements and displays the distresses that have the highest deducts for each section.  Place a higher priority on the distresses that have the highest deducts.  In addition, apply the SIR  guidance  in  the  business  rules  to  global  and  localized  preventive  maintenance requirements  to  ensure  the  PMP  includes  projects  that  have  a  high  payback  and  reduce  the life-cycle cost. 9.12.4.  Group  Work  Requirements:  PAVER  makes  recommendations  on  the  year  of execution  of  specific  work  requirements  based  on  the  projected  condition,  critical  PCI, Branch Use, and Rank.  The engineer must apply judgment in determining how best to group these requirements.  For instance, a base would most likely not want to do a mill and overlay project on a portion of their runway every year for three years.  These requirements would be grouped in a single project executed in one year. 9.12.5.  Determine  Method  of  Execution:  The  final  phase  in  developing  a  PMP  is determining and documenting the method of execution: what is executed in-house and what is executed by contract (project).  Once defined, the base uses a pavement management plan with requirements prioritized and grouped for a specific method of execution.  In-house work requirements  typically  are  for  preventive  maintenance.  The  base  can  incorporate  the requirements into preventive maintenance task lists for execution.  If executed by project, the base should integrate requirements with those of other asset types e.g. drainage, lighting, etc. to ensure projects are scoped properly.   64 AFI32-1041  17 FEBRUARY 2017 9.13.  Validating  Quantities  and  Scoping  Work  Plans  and  Projects:  PCI  surveys  are conducted at a 95% confidence level.  This means that a specified percentage of sample units are inspected to ensure that the reported PCI is plus or minus five points of the actual PCI.  Once the base determines the areas that require work, the scope of that work, and the method of execution, bases  will  need  to  validate  the  quantities  of  the  distresses  to  be  repaired  and  to  update  these quantities,  if  required.    This  is  the  case  whether  the  repairs  are  done  in-house  or  by  contract.  Furthermore, in the case of major M&R, the base should use the Engineering Assessment data, work  history,  and  structural  evaluation  data  to  ensure  the  project  is  scoped  properly. AFCEC/COAT is available to provide support on specific project scoping questions.  JOHN B.
