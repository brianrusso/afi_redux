This CFETP provides information necessary for the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the training that individuals must receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  For the purpose of this plan, training is divided into four areas: initial skills, upgrade training (UGT), qualification training (QT), and continuation training (CT). Initial skills training is the Air Force Specialty specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion required for award of the 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge training required for the job.  Continuation training is additional training either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to maintain their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required.  The CFETP has several purposes, some are: 1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.   1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in this specialty and recommends training and education throughout each phase of an individual's career. 1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training medium. 1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired specialty training program. 2.  Uses.   The will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available and/or instituted for each individual in the specialty. 2.1.  Training personnel will develop and revise formal resident, non-resident, and exportable training based on requirements established by the user and documented in Part II of the CFETP. The lead command MFM will coordinate with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial and upgrade skills requirements.  Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate available training resources. 2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 2.4.  Personnel in AFSCs 1AXXX or 1U0X1 are exempt from maintaining OJT Training Folders (AF Form 623). All training is certified via AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, by trained flight examiners.  Certification on the AF Form 8 eliminates the requirement to document STS items in this CFETP. 3.  Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is approval authority.  MAJCOM functional managers and AETC training managers will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document and coordinate with AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.  Send applicable inputs/changes to this CFETP through MAJCOM Functional Managers to HQ USAF/A3OIM, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington D.C. 20330-1480 or the following organizational email address:  usaf.pentagon.af-a3.mbx.a3oim-workflow@mail.mil       8 CFETP 1A0X1 19 January 2016 Section B - Career Progression and Information 4.

Each objective is indicated as follows:  W indicates task or subject knowledge which is measured using a written test, PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a performance progress check, and PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress check. 5.  Standard.   The standard is 85 percent on written examinations.  Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. 6.  Proficiency Level.  Most task performance is taught to the “1a” proficiency level which means the students can do simple parts of the task, but needs to be told or shown how to do most of the task (extremely limited) or to a “2b” proficiency level which means the students can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task. 7.  Advanced Skills Course. NOTE:  There is currently no advanced course.  This area is reserved.
