MVACs  and  MIFRACs  are  developed  and  maintained  by  TERPS  authorities  as directed  by  ATC  facility  management  using  the  Chart  Designer  module  of  Global  Procedure Designer (GPD) software.  MVACs and MIFRACs do not require flight inspection. 2.1.1.  Minimum  Vectoring  Altitude  Chart.    Establish  MVACs  in  accordance  with  this chapter and FAAO JO 7210.3, Facility Operation and Administration, Chapter 3, Section 9, Other  Displays  as  appropriate.    The  MVAC  is  used  to  determine  the  lowest  useable Instrument  Flight  Rules  (IFR)  altitude  at  which  an  aircraft  may  be  vectored  and  maintain clearance from obstructions, terrain and uncontrolled airspace in a radar environment. Note 1.  Changes in GPD to Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) or chart center location made after chart construction results in a condition where the chart cannot be restored. Note 2.  AF locations with TERPS responsibility and where terminal radar service is provided by the FAA or host nation (e.g., a USAF Visual Flight Rules (VFR) control tower) are not required to develop a MVAC however, they are required to obtain a copy of the FAA or host nation MVAC from the controlling facility for reference during instrument procedure development (T-1). Note 3.  TERPS functions required to develop MVACs shall obtain copies of the current MVAC used by adjacent ATC facilities (T-1).  Consider the adjacent ATC facilities MVAC when developing the USAF chart to prevent excessive altitude changes between the two facilities’ adjoining MVAC sectors. Note 4.  When developing MVACs for Digital ASR (DASR)/Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS), enter the DASR magnetic variation (MV) of record for the DASR, not STARS equipment.  In most cases the DASR MV of record is zero, but some DASRs were installed with same MV as the airport.  Either way, use the actual MV assigned to the DASR.  If unsure of the DASR’s MV of record, contact the appropriate radar maintenance. 2.1.2.  Definitions and chart types. 2.1.2.1.  Terminal  MVAC.    This  chart  supports  those  systems  where  radar  data  is provided by a feed from a single short range (terminal) ASR or DASR antenna.  Develop terminal  MVACs  for  legacy  analog  radars  (GPN-12  and  GPN-20)  and  mobile  ASRs (MPN-14,  MPN-25  and  TPN-19),  and  DASR  (GPN-30).    Terminal  MVAC  rules  may also  be  used  for  multi-sensor  mosaic  systems  where  radar  data  from  a  single  terminal radar is selected or adapted.  Develop terminal MVACs for a single-sensor terminal radar mode  and  for  designated  terminal  areas  where  the  area  is  adapted  to  utilize  a  single terminal radar.  Three nautical mile (NM) lateral separation is provided from terrain and obstructions (sector buffer) within 40 NM of the ASR/DASR and 5 NM lateral separation is provided 40 NM and greater from the chart center.  A terminal MVAC is centered on the  terminal  ASR/DASR  antenna  in  order  for  GPD  to  determine  where  to  apply  the increase in lateral separation to 5 NM.  For a terminal area where ATC has the ability to switch  from  single-sensor  to  multi-sensor  mode,  an  enroute  MVAC  must  be  developed 8 AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 (T-1).    When  operationally  advantageous,  both  a  terminal  and  enroute  MVAC  may  be developed. 2.1.2.2.  Enroute MVAC.  This chart supports those systems where radar data is provided by a feed from one or more long range (enroute) Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR) antennas,  or  a  feed  from  more  than  one  terminal  radar.    Develop  enroute  MVACs  for multi-sensor  mosaic  systems  such  as  Microprocessor  En  Route  Automated  Radar (MEARTS)  or  STARS,  except  for  the  adapted  terminal  area  specified  in  paragraph  2.1.2.1.  When a terminal MVAC is developed for the terminal area or the single-sensor mode of a multi-sensor system, develop and maintain both terminal and enroute MVACs.  Enroute  MVACs  are  also  required  to  provide  backup  for  Center  Radar  Presentation (CENRAP)  operations.    Five  NM  lateral  separation  is  provided  from  terrain  and obstructions (sector buffer) regardless of the distance from the chart center or aerodrome.  Chart  center  is  not  required  to  be  at  any  set  location,  but  is  normally  the  center  of assigned  ATC  airspace  or  the  Airport  Reference  Point  (ARP)  of  the  primary  airport.  Enter  into  GPD  Data  Manager  a  ‘pseudo’  ASR  (named  ‘chrt_ctr’)  within  5  NM  of  the center of the workspace; when this option is used, enter a magnetic variation of zero. 2.1.2.2.1.  When  CENRAP  is  utilized  as  a  backup  to  a  terminal  system  separate terminal and enroute charts must also be developed (T-2). 2.1.2.2.2.  Facility  managers  may  elect  to  develop  a  single  enroute  chart  to  support both normal and CENRAP operations to reduce complexity. 2.1.3.  Standard sector.  A sector bounded by two bearings and two ranges (arcs) relative to chart center. 2.1.4.  Irregular sector.  A more complex sector bounded by more than two bearings and two ranges relative to chart center. 2.1.5.  Polygonal  sector.    A  sector  defined  by  the  World  Geodetic  System  (WGS)-84 coordinates  of  each  corner  (vertex).    There  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of  sides  to  this  type sector. 2.1.6.  Prominent  obstacle  sector.    This  is  an  “all  buffer”  sector  intended  to  provide  the required  vertical  and  lateral  clearance  from  a  single,  isolated,  man-made  obstacle.    When  a single, isolated, man-made obstacle causes the entire sector altitude to be higher than desired, a  prominent  obstacle  sector  may  be  established.    A  prominent  obstacle  sector  may  be contained within a single larger sector, or overlap several adjacent sectors and can be based on an obstacle that is outside the MVAC radius but within the buffer area of the sector. 2.1.6.1.  This sector type is only authorized to provide separation from an isolated, man-made obstacle that is significantly higher than surrounding terrain or obstructions (Figure 2.1).    Note:    All  obstacles  inside  the  prominent  obstacle  sector,  except  those  obstacles that fall within the horizontal accuracy of the obstacle upon which the prominent obstacle sector  is  based,  are  evaluated  when  determining  the  minimum  altitude  of  the  sector(s) surrounding or adjoining the prominent obstacle sector. AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 9 Figure 2.1.  Application of Prominent Obstacle Sector without High Surrounding Terrain 2.1.6.2.  Prominent  obstacle  sectors  cannot  be  used  to  provide  separation  from  terrain features  such  as  mountain  peaks  that  may  or  may  not  have  towers  or  antennas  near  the peak (Figure 2.2).  Figure 2.2.  Misapplication of Prominent Obstacle Sector with High Surrounding Terrain 2.1.7.  Chart design.  10 AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 2.1.7.1.  Determine which type chart (Terminal, Enroute, or both) is applicable based on paragraph  2.1.2.  Establish MVACs irrespective of the flight-checked radar coverage in the  sector  concerned;  they  are  based  on  obstruction  clearance  criteria  and  controlled airspace only.  It is the responsibility of ATC to determine that a target return is adequate for  radar  control  purposes.    It  is  not  relevant  to  MVAC  development  whether  radar service in a specific area is provided using primary or secondary radar. 2.1.7.1.1.  For  a  Terminal  MVAC,  the  area  considered  for  obstacle  clearance  (chart radius)  shall  encompass  the  maximum  range  of  the  ASR  primary  radar  and  be extended to include all delegated airspace (T-2).  This includes adjacent areas where control  responsibility  is  assumed  because  of  early  handoff  or  track  initiation.  Exception:  When developing a Terminal MVAC to support the designated terminal area of a multi-sensor system (paragraph 2.1.2), the area only needs be large enough to include the entire terminal area to include the appropriate buffer area based on the distance from the ASR/DASR. 2.1.7.1.2.  For  an  Enroute  MVAC,  the  area  considered  for  obstacle  clearance  (chart radius) shall be large enough to include 20 NM beyond delegated airspace boundaries to  include  adjacent  areas  where  control  responsibility  is  assumed  because  of  early handoff  or  track  initiation  (T-2).    When  developing  an  Enroute  MVAC,  ensure  that “Radar  has  CENRAP  display”  is  selected  in  the  chart  properties  of  GPD  regardless  of whether or not the chart is being developed for CENRAP operations to ensure the proper buffer size is constructed. 2.1.7.2.  To aid in determining the appropriate chart radius, delegated ATC airspace may be entered into GPD Data Manager as a new, unclassified airspace.  (See GPD Operators Manual, Volume 1, paragraph 13.11.2). 2.1.7.3.  Define the chart properties.  Specify whether the default terrain type for the chart is  designated mountainous or non-mountainous in  accordance with  (IAW) Subpart B of 14  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  PART  95  in  the  Continental  United  States (CONUS).    Outside  the  CONUS,  review  the  appropriate  host  nation  Aeronautical Information  Publication  ATC  (AIP)  or  other  applicable  directives  and  comply  with mountainous terrain designations.  When the host nation has not explicitly defined terrain type designations, evaluate the topography of the area to determine if it is a mountainous area as defined by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (3000 feet of terrain elevation change within a distance of 10 NM).  Additionally, check enroute charts (host and  National  Geospatial  Agency  (NGA))  to  ascertain  the  required  obstacle  clearance (ROC)  applied  on  air  traffic  service  (ATS)  routes  and  to  off-route  altitudes  such  as minimum  off-route  altitude  (MORA)  and  off-route  obstruction  clearance  altitude (OROCA).    Make  a  determination  which  terrain  type  is  appropriate  and  document  the rationale in the chart’s user defined notes. 2.1.7.3.1.  When non-mountainous terrain is specified, 1000 feet of ROC is applied as the  system  default.    When  mountainous  terrain  is  specified,  2000  feet  of  ROC  is applied as the system default. 2.1.7.3.2.  Where  lower  altitudes  are  necessary  in  designated  mountainous  areas  to achieve  compatibility  with  terminal  routes  or  to  permit  vectoring  to  an  instrument approach, the default ROC may be reduced to 1000 feet for a Terminal MVAC, and AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 11 1500 feet  or 1700 feet  for an Enroute MVAC as specified in  FAAO 8260.3,  United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS), Volume 1, paragraph 10.2.5.    Annotate  each  sector  with  the  statement  “ROC  reduced  to  less  than  2000 feet” in the appropriate sector defined notes. 2.1.7.4.  Specify  the  appropriate  allowance  for  trees.    This  allowance  will  be  applied uniformly to the entire terrain model (T-2).  Where vegetation is sparse, or has variable heights, or when using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), it may be preferable to  add  assumptions  for  vegetation  to  the  sector  altitude  rather  than  entering  a  tree allowance to the entire area.  Document this choice in the designer notes. For additional guidance about vegetation (tree) allowance, see:  AFI 11-230, paragraph 2.20.1.4. 2.1.7.5.  Specify  standard,  irregular,  or  polygonal  sectors  or  any  combination  thereof based on the terrain, obstacle and airspace environment or other operational requirements (radar patterns, noise abatement areas, Special Use Airspace (SUA), etc.).  Ensure sector coverage  over  the  entire  chart  with  no  gaps  between  sectors.    With  the  exception  of  a prominent  obstacle  sector,  each  sector’s  boundary  must  adjoin,  but  not  overlap,  the boundary  of  each  adjacent  sector  (T-2).    In  some  cases  it  may  be  desirable  to  combine adjacent smaller areas having different altitudes into a single large area with one altitude.  See Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4. 2.1.7.5.1.  Make  each  obstacle  sector,  except  for  prominent  obstacle  sectors,  large enough to permit the efficient and safe vectoring of aircraft.  Consideration should be given to aircraft performance and phase of flight. 2.1.7.5.2.  There is  no limitation  to  what  sector types may be developed  for either  a terminal or enroute MVAC.  For example, polygonal sectors can be established for a terminal  chart,  and  standard  sectors  can  be  defined  for  enroute.    However,  when MVAC  sector  design  impacts  MSAW  or  LAAS,  consider  low  altitude  alerting development  limitations  (i.e.,  MEARTS  MSAW  sectors  can  only  be  defined  as convex polygons; Programmable Indicator Data Processor (PIDP) MSAW sectors can only be defined by range and bearing).  Coordinate with ATC automation personnel when  applicable  to  determine  optimum  sector  design.  MVAC  sector  design  has  no bearing on STARS MSAW. 2.1.7.6.  Specify sector altitudes no less than the minimum altitude.  The selected altitude shall provide at least the ROC above obstructions and terrain plus vegetation allowance in  the  sector,  including  buffer,  and  must  be  at  least  300  feet  above  the  highest  floor  of controlled airspace (FOCA) in the sector, not including buffer, rounded to the higher 100-foot increment (T-2). 2.1.7.7.  Host  nations  may  detail  FOCA  in  their  AIPs  or  other  sources,  however  some compute  this  data  differently  than  US  criteria.    Check  with  appropriate  host  nation personnel  to  ensure  accurate  information  is  applied.    When  a  host  nation  does  not designate the FOCA, controlled airspace is considered to begin at the surface.  Document in the chart’s user defined notes and, when available, include a hard copy version of the host nation’s airspace description in the chart package. 12 AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 Figure 2.3.

The MIFRAC is used to determine the  lowest  useable  IFR  altitude  at  which  an  aircraft  may  operate,  receive  the  appropriate Navigation Aid (NAVAID), and maintain clearance from obstructions, terrain and uncontrolled airspace in a non-radar environment. Note 1.  Changes to GPD facility location data made after chart construction result in a condition where the chart cannot be restored. Note 2. Minimum IFR altitudes are only intended for off-route and direct-route operations. The Minimum En Route Altitude (MEA) or Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude (MOCA) in a particular area has no impact on MIFRAC design. 2.2.1.  Chart  Design.    Develop  a  MIFRAC  centered  on  each  omni-directional  NAVAID (Tactical  Air  Navigation  (TACAN),  VHF  Omnidirectional  Range/Tactical  Air  Navigation (VORTAC),  VHF  Omnidirectional  Range  (VOR)  or  Non-directional  Beacon  (NDB))  used for non-radar operations. 14 AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 2.2.1.1.  Do not  exceed the standard service volume of the NAVAID.  The existence of an expanded service volume has no bearing on MIFRAC design unless approved for an entire area or sector in which off-route operations are conducted.  The area considered for obstacle  clearance  (chart  radius)  must  be  large  enough  to  encompass  the  standard NAVAID service volume for the highest altitude where control responsibility is routinely assumed  (T-2).    The  chart  radius  shall  encompass  all  delegated  airspace  to  include adjacent areas where control responsibility is assumed (T-2). 2.2.1.2.  Specify  the  default  terrain  type  IAW  paragraph    2.1.7.3  and  the  vegetation allowance IAW paragraph  2.1.7.4. 2.2.1.3.  When  defining  the  MIFRAC,  recommend  associating  it  with  the  MVAC.  Develop MVACs IAW paragraph 2.1. and unless operationally necessary (i.e., only non-radar  operations  are  conducted)  associate  the  MIFRAC  with  the  MVAC  in  the  chart properties. 2.2.1.4.  Specify  standard  or  irregular  sectors  or  any  combination  based  on  the  terrain, obstacle,  airspace  environment,  MVAC  and  other  operational  requirements  (radar patterns, noise abatement areas, SUA, etc.).  Ensure sector coverage over the entire chart with no gaps between sectors.  Each sector’s boundary must adjoin, but not overlap, the boundary of  each adjacent  sector (T-1).   In some cases, it may be desirable to  combine adjacent smaller areas having different altitudes into a single large area with one altitude (Figure  2.6).    Note:    There  is  no  “Terminal”  or  “Enroute”  distinction  for  MIFRACs;  5 NM lateral separation (buffer area) is provided from terrain and obstructions regardless of the distance to the facility. 2.2.1.5.  Specify only one sector altitude in each sector no less than the minimum altitude.  This  minimum  altitude  shall  provide  at  least  the  required  ROC  above  obstructions  and terrain plus vegetation allowance in the sector, including buffer, and must be at least 300 feet  above  the  highest  FOCA  in  the  sector,  not  including  buffer,  rounded  to  the  higher 100-foot increment (T-2).  The selected MIFRAC sector altitude shall not be lower than the highest Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) for that given area (T-2). Note 1.  When determining MIFRAC sector altitudes, do not include MIFRAC sector buffer areas when evaluating the associated underlying MVAC sectors. Note 2: CAUTION: Two or more MVA altitudes may affect a single MIFRAC sector. Annotate each sector where paragraph 2.1.7.3.2 is applied with the statement “ROC reduced to less than 2000” (Figure 2.7). 2.2.1.6.  Consider  restrictions  noted  on  flight  inspection  reports  or  Aviation  Standards Information  System  (ASIS)  datasheet  (i.e.,  horizontal  and  vertical  NAVAID  limitations to include unusable sectors) when determining sector design and when specifying sector altitudes  (Figure  2.5).    For  example,  for  the  first  restriction  shown  in  Figure  2.5,  the MIFRAC sector from R-130 clockwise to R-160 beyond 29 NM out to the chart radius is not  to  be  lower  than  9000  feet  MSL  regardless  of  the  minimum  altitude  specified  by GPD.  When flight inspection designates that no coverage exists in an area, annotate the sector as unusable. AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 15 Figure 2.5.

ATC  Chart  Documentation  and  Processing.  Create  and  maintain  either  a  hard  copy (paper)  or  electronic  copy  of  the  ATC  Chart  procedure  package  containing  documentation  as follows: 2.3.1.  Hard  copy  documentation  includes  the  computer  generated  MVAC  or  MIFRAC Report  and  signed  AF  Form  4343  ATC  Charts  Signature  Page.    GPD  produces  hard  copy Obstacle  Quality  and  Workspace  Quality  Reports.    These  are  intended  to  assist  in aeronautical data resolution and are not required in the chart package. 2.3.1.1.  Include all hard copy source documentation relating to  aeronautical  or obstacle data  revisions  pertinent  to  the  chart  to  include  hard  copy  correspondence  to  MAJCOM TERPS function. AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 17 2.3.2.  Electronic documentation consists of all GPD export files and signed AF Form 4343, as appropriate.  In addition, include additional electronic documentation, to include scanned versions  of  hard  copies,  relating  to  aeronautical  or  obstacle  data  revisions  pertinent  to  the chart, along with correspondence with the MAJCOM TERPS function. 2.3.3.  Coordination.  The TERPS function will obtain all approval signatures, as appropriate (T-3).    The  instrument  procedure  designer,  the  appropriate  ATC  Facility  Manager,  Airfield Operations Flight Commander, and MAJCOM TERPS shall provide the required signatures for ATC charts documented on AF Form 4343 (T-2).  FAA or host nation signatures are only required  when  mandated  by  formal  agreement.    Other  signatures  are  determined  by  the MAJCOM. 18 AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 Chapter 3 MINIMUM SAFE ALTITUDE WARNING (MSAW) AND LOW ALTITUDE ALERTING SYSTEM (LAAS) 3.1.  General.  MSAW  and  LAAS  use  visual  and  aural  alarms  to  alert  the  controller  when  a radar track target with mode C is at or below (MSAW) or below (LAAS) a predetermined safe altitude.  MSAW and LAAS automatically processes all tracked targets with an operational mode C  unless  the  controller  exempts  the  target  from  processing.    Manual  validation  of  MSAW  and LAAS  data  is  required  whenever  the  MVAC  is  re-accomplished  (T-1).  MSAW  and  LAAS require flight inspection. Note 1.  USAF PIDP systems do not have Approach Path Monitor (APM) capability; therefore MSAW flight inspections at USAF PIDP locations consist of a General Terrain Map (GTM) equivalent check only (no “preflight inspection plans” as outlined in AFMAN 11-225 United States Standard Flight Inspection Manual). Note 2. The term LAAS may not be understood by flight inspection personnel. When coordinating with flight inspection, ensure that all correspondence clearly identifies the requirement as a request for a check of the MSAW LAAS. 3.2.  Minimum Safe Altitude Warning. 3.2.1.  Single-Sensor Analog Radar Systems.  MAJCOMs submit original and change request packages to AFFSA/A4S at least 30 days prior to the effective date.  Address correspondence concerning  MSAW  to:  hqaffsa.a4s@us.af.mil  or  HQ  AFFSA/A4S,  6500  S.  MacArthur Blvd, Bldg 4, Room 114, Oklahoma City OK 73169. 3.2.2.  Develop PIDP MSAW using appropriate charts based on processor capability, terrain, and  local  operating  needs.    After  the  data  is  processed,  AFFSA/XS  forwards  copies  of computer-generated charts to the facility.  These charts represent the data included as part of the operational program for the facility.  The TERPS authority shall review the printout for accuracy, then sign and date (T-2).  When changes are necessary, the MAJCOM shall submit corrections to AFFSA/XS. 3.2.2.1.  Step-by-step build of an MSAW package.   Figure 3.1. shows the identification of  runways,  Class  C/D  airspace,  along  with  final,  intermediate  and/or  initial  approach areas  out  to  the  descent  point.    Figure  3.2.  identifies  general  MSAW  areas  based  on MVAC  sectors.    Figure  3.3.,  Figure  3.4.,  Figure  3.5.,  and  Figure  3.6.,  illustrate  the azimuth and range identification process.  Table 3.1. shows the PIDP MSAW Data Chart in the format AFFSA/A4S uses to prepare the operational program tapes. 3.2.2.2.  MSAW  packages  consist  of  an  Approach  Area  Detail  Map  (AADM),  a  GTM, and  a  completed  PIDP  MSAW  Data  Chart.    All  MSAW  map  bearings  and  distances originate  at  the  ASR  antenna  serving  the  airport  for  which  the  MSAW  is  being developed.  All distances are in nautical miles (NMs) and all bearings are magnetic from the ASR antenna. 3.2.2.3.  MSAW coverage shall encompass the ATC facility’s assigned airspace, special use airspace, and any areas where agreements with adjacent ATC facilities allow for the AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 19 control of IFR aircraft (T-2).  The MSAW GTM drawings must clearly depict these areas (T-2). 3.2.2.3.1.  Develop  two  maps  centered  on  the  primary  airport’s  ASR  antenna;  an AADM and a GTM. 3.2.2.3.1.1.  The  AADM  defines  the  MSAW  circling  area  and  approach  courses for the primary airport.  This map must be large enough (normally 0 – 15 NM) to include  all  approaches  out  to  the  applicable  descent  points  (paragraph  3.2.2.4.3) (T-1). 3.2.2.3.1.2.  The  GTM  defines  all  other  MSAW  areas  (i.e.,  larger,  less-detailed MVAC sectors).  It extends from the edge of the AADM out to the limits of the areas defined in paragraph  3.2.2.3. 3.2.2.4.  MSAW chart design. 3.2.2.4.1.  Draw all instrument final approach courses to airports within the facility’s assigned airspace (Figure 3.1.). 3.2.2.4.2.  To define the MSAW exempt areas, draw a 4 NM circle around the ASR antenna at the primary airport, and around each satellite airport’s ARP.  The altitude within  these  areas  is  set  at  zero.    MSAW  exempt  areas  eliminate  nuisance  alarms from aircraft descending on final approach and from aircraft climbing after departure or low approach/touch and go. 3.2.2.4.3.  Plot  the  point  on  each  instrument  approach  procedure  where  the  aircraft descends below the MVA (Figure 3.1).  This point is referred to as the descent point. Determine descent points as follows: 3.2.2.4.3.1.  Work outwards from the airport to find the first published fix with an altitude that is equal to or higher than the MVA.  If this fix is within the MSAW exempt area (4 NM from ASR/ARP), no further action is necessary. 3.2.2.4.3.2.  When the fix falls outside of the MSAW exempt area and the altitude is equal to the MVA, the fix becomes the descent point.  If the altitude at this fix is  above  the  MVA,  work  inwards  towards  the  Missed  Approach  Point  (MAP) using  the  maximum  authorized  descent  gradient  until  reaching  the  MVA.    That point  then  becomes  the  descent  point.    If  the  descent  point  then  falls  within  the MSAW exempt area, no further action is necessary. 3.2.2.4.4.  Take the following action when the descent point falls outside the MSAW exempt area: 3.2.2.4.4.1.  When  the  descent  point  falls  between  the  MSAW  exempt  area  and the Final Approach Fix (FAF): 3.2.2.4.4.1.1.  Draw  all  applicable  instrument  approach  procedure  final segments,  including  circling  only  procedures,  (primary  areas  only)  from  the MSAW exempt area outward to the descent point. 3.2.2.4.4.1.2.  The altitude selected for MSAW processing within the primary final  segment  trapezoid(s)  shall  be  no  more  than  100  feet  below  the  lowest published    Minimum  Descent  Altitude  (MDA)  for  that  runway,  and  shall 20 AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 provide at least 200 feet clearance above terrain and obstructions (T-2). 3.2.2.4.4.2.  When  the  descent  point  falls  between  the  FAF  and  the  Intermediate Fix (IF): 3.2.2.4.4.2.1.  Draw  all applicable final  and intermediate segments, including circling  only  procedures,  (primary  areas  only)  from  the  MSAW  exempt  area outward to the descent point. 3.2.2.4.4.2.2.  The altitude selected for MSAW processing within the primary intermediate  segment  trapezoid(s)  shall  be  no  more  than  200  feet  below  the lowest  published FAF crossing altitude and shall provide at  least  300 feet  of clearance  above  terrain  and  obstructions  (T-2).    The  altitude  selected  for MSAW  processing  within  the  primary  final  segment  trapezoid(s)  shall  be IAW paragraph 3.2.2.4.4.1.2. above (T-2). 3.2.2.4.4.3.  When the descent point falls between the IF and the Initial Approach Fix (IAF): 3.2.2.4.4.3.1.  Draw  all  applicable  final,  intermediate,  and  initial  segments, including  circling  only  procedures  (primary  areas  only),  from  the  MSAW exempt area outward to the descent point. 3.2.2.4.4.3.2.  The altitude selected for MSAW processing within the primary initial  segment  trapezoid(s)  shall  be  no  more  than  300  feet  below  the  lowest published IF crossing altitude and shall provide at least 300 feet of clearance above  terrain  and  obstructions  (T-2).    The  altitude  selected  for  MSAW processing within the primary intermediate segment trapezoid(s) shall be IAW paragraph  3.2.2.4.4.2.2.  (T-2).    The  altitude  selected  for  MSAW  processing within  the  primary  final  segment  trapezoid(s)  shall  be  IAW  paragraph 3.2.2.4.4.1.1 (T-2). 3.2.2.4.4.4.  For  all  other  areas,  the  altitude  selected  shall  be  no  more  than  300 feet  below  the  MVA  and  shall  provide  a  minimum  of  at  least  700  feet  above terrain  and  obstacles  (the  minimum  is  1,700  feet  in  designated  mountainous terrain) (T-2). Note.  When two MVA sector altitudes are established due to excessively high FOCA (paragraph 2.1.7.6, Note 1), the MSAW sector altitude will be based on the lowest MVA in the sector (T-2). 3.2.2.5.  MSAW sector data collection. 3.2.2.5.1.  Define  the  boundaries  of  each  MSAW  sector  by  two  ASR  bearings  (start and stop) and by two ranges (start and stop).  Depict all MSAW sectors as either pie- shaped, truncated pie-shaped, or circular around a point of origin.  Using Figure 3.3. and  Figure  3.6  as  examples,  draw  bearings  to  encompass  all  areas  identified  in paragraph  3.2.1.4.    Each  bearing  originates  at  the  ASR  antenna  and  extends  to  the range  of  the  map  being  developed  (AADM  or  GTM).    Measure  the  angle  of  each bearing and label.  Combine bearings to include/reduce irregularly shaped areas when necessary.    Ensure  continuous  sectors  do  not  cross  the  0  degree  bearing  or  the  360 degree bearing.  Split sectors crossing either the 0 or the 360 degree bearing into two AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 21 sectors;  stop  the  first  sector  at  the  360  degree  bearing  and  start  the  second  sector  at the 0 degree bearing.  Record bearings from the ASR in whole degree increments. 3.2.2.5.2.  Using Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.6 as examples, draw arcs (ranges) from the ASR antenna to  encompass  those areas identified in  paragraph 3.2.2.4.   Record Arc ranges to the nearest 0.25 NM. Note.  Computer memory limitations restrict the number of azimuth and range boundaries to 32.  Take appropriate action to remain within this number, but in no case will aircraft operate below the MVA without proper MSAW processing (T-2). 3.2.2.5.3.  Label the MSAW altitude for each sector. 3.2.2.6.  Transfer the range, azimuth, and altitude information to the PIDP MSAW Data Chart (Table 3.1) as follows: 3.2.2.6.1.  Starting with the zero degree bearing entered in the upper left corner of the azimuth  block,  continuing  clockwise,  enter  selected  bearings  from  both  map  scales (AADM and GTM) in ascending order.  The stop bearing for one sector becomes the start bearing for the succeeding sector from left to right across the top of the form. 3.2.2.6.2.  On  the  left  side  of  the  chart,  starting  with  zero  range,  enter  each  range selected  in  ascending  order  down  the  left  side  of  the  chart.    The  stop  range  for  one sector is the start range for the next top to bottom down the left side of the form.  The intersection  of  each  start-stop  bearing  and  start-stop  ranges  represents  a  sector.    For each sector, enter the MSAW processing altitude IAW paragraph 3.2.2.4 in hundreds of feet MSL (e.g., 6 = 600 feet, 100 = 10,000 feet) (T-2). 3.2.3.  Multi-Sensor (Mosaic) Digital Radar Systems. 3.2.3.1.  MEARTS.    MSAW  parameters  are  developed  during  initial  site  adaptation.  TERPS personnel shall coordinate with the unit NAAM for revisions, and when making procedural  changes to  instrument  approaches that may affect  the APM  (e.g., changes to fix crossing altitudes, approach minimums, addition/deletion of step-down fixes, etc) (T-2). 3.2.3.2.  STARS MSAW.  The applicable operations support facility (OSF) will develop STARS  MSAW,  GTM  and  APM  during  initial  site  adaptation  (T-2).    The  OSF  is responsible  for  updating  the  GTM.    TERPS  personnel  shall  coordinate  with  the  unit NAAM  when  making  procedural  changes  to  instrument  approaches  that  may  affect  the APM  (e.g.,  changes  to  fix  crossing  altitudes,  approach  minimums,  addition/deletion  of step-down fixes, etc.) (T-2).  There is no action required by the TERPS function when the GTM changes. 22 AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 Figure 3.1.  MSAW/LAAS Package Development.

Low Altitude Alerting System. 3.3.1.  LAAS  associated  with  Digital  Bright  Radar  Indicator  Tower  Equipment  (DBRITE).  Only  develop  LAAS  for  those  DBRITE  systems  authorized  to  provide  additional  radar functions  beyond  those  normally  allowed  for  certified  tower  displays  IAW  AFI  13-204 Volume  3  and  FAAO  JO  7110.65,  Air  Traffic  Control.    This  is  not  applicable  to  DBRITE systems  deriving  radar/automation  data  from  a  source  with  an  operational  PIDP  MSAW  or an  FAA  equivalent  system  such  as  Automated  Radar  Terminal  Systems  (ARTS).    These DBRITE  systems  process  MSAW  data  exactly  like  an  indicator  of  the  associated  system.  Submit  original  and  change  request  packages  through  the  MAJCOM  TERPS  office  in  time for  receipt  by  AFFSA/A4S  at  least  7  days  prior  to  the  effective  date.    Address  email AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 29 correspondence concerning DBRITE LAAS to: hqaffsa.a4s@us.af.mil  or HQ AFFSA/A4S, 6500 S. MacArthur Blvd, Bldg 4, Room 114, Oklahoma City OK 73169 3.3.2.  Develop  LAAS  using  appropriate  charts  based  on  processor  capability,  terrain,  and local operating needs.  After the data is processed, AFFSA/XS forwards copies of computer-generated 15 NM and 60 NM charts to the facility.  These charts represent the data included as  part  of  the  operational  program  for  the  facility.    The  TERPS  authority  shall  review  the printout for accuracy, then sign and date (T-2).  When changes are required, the MAJCOM shall submit corrections to AFFSA/XS (T-2). 3.3.2.1.  DBRITE LAAS packages are developed in the same manner as MSAW, subject to equipment-specific radial/range restrictions (Figure 3.1. through Figure 3.6.).  Figure 3.1.  shows  the  identification  of  runways,  Class  C/D  airspace,  along  with  final, intermediate and/or initial approach areas out to the descent point.  Figure 3.2. identifies general LAAS areas based on assigned airspace and MVA sectors.   Figure 3.3. through Figure 3.6. illustrate the azimuth and range identification process. 3.3.2.2.  DBRITE  LAAS  packages  consist  of  an  AADM,  a  GTM,  and  a  completed  AF Form 3646, DBRITE Low Altitude Alerting System (LAAS) Data Submission Form.  All LAAS maps are centered on the ASR antenna serving the airport for which the LAAS is being developed.  All  distances are in  NM and all bearings are magnetic from  the ASR antenna. 3.3.2.3.  DBRITE LAAS coverage shall encompass the ATC facility’s assigned airspace, special  use  airspace  where  ATC  controls  IFR  aircraft  and  any  areas  where  agreements with adjacent ATC facilities allow for the control of IFR aircraft (T-2).  The LAAS GTM drawings must clearly depict these airspace boundaries/areas (T-2). 3.3.2.4.  Develop two maps centered on the ASR antenna: an AADM and a GTM. 3.3.2.4.1.  The AADM defines the  LAAS circling areas and approach courses to  the primary airport.  This map must be large enough (normally 0 – 15 NM) to include all approaches out to the applicable descent points (paragraph 3.3.2.5.4) (T-2). 3.3.2.4.2.  The  GTM  (normally  15  –  60  NM)  -  defines  all  other  LAAS  areas  (i.e., larger, less-detailed MVAC sectors).  It covers the airspace from edge of the AADM out to the limits of the areas defined in paragraph  3.3.2.3., not to exceed 60 NM from the ASR antenna. 3.3.2.5.  DBRITE LAAS chart design. 3.3.2.5.1.  Draw  all  final  approach  courses  to  airports  within  the  facility’s  assigned airspace (Figure 3.1.). 3.3.2.5.2.  To  define  the  LAAS  exempt  areas,  draw  a  4  NM  circle  around  the  ASR antenna at the primary airport, and around each satellite airport’s ARP.  The altitude within these areas  is set at zero.  LAAS exempt areas eliminate nuisance alarms from aircraft  descending  on  final  approach  and  from  aircraft  climbing  after  departure  or low approach/touch and go. 3.3.2.5.3.  Plot  the  point  on  each  instrument  approach  procedure  where  the  aircraft descends below the MVA (Figure 3.1).  This point is referred to as the descent point.  Determine the descent point as follows: 30 AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 3.3.2.5.3.1.  Work outwards from the airport to find the first published fix with an altitude that is equal  to or higher than the MVA.  If this fix is within the  LAAS exempt area (4 NM from ASR/ARP), no further action is necessary. 3.3.2.5.3.2.  When the fix falls outside of the LAAS exempt area and the altitude is equal to the MVA, the fix becomes the descent point.  If the altitude at this fix is  above  the  MVA,  work  inwards  towards  the  MAP  using  the  maximum authorized descent gradient until reaching the MVA.  That point then becomes the descent  point.    If  the  descent  point  then  falls  within  the  LAAS  exempt  area,  no further action is necessary. 3.3.2.5.4.  When  the  descent  point  falls  outside  the  LAAS  exempt  area  take  the following action: 3.3.2.5.4.1.  When the descent point falls between the LAAS exempt area and the FAF/Precise  FAF  (PFAF),  draw  the  final  approach  primary  trapezoid  from  the LAAS  exempt  area  outward  to  the  descent  point.    Note:  Assign  an  altitude  for LAAS  processing  within  the  primary  trapezoid  that  is  at  or  above  the  lowest published  MDA  for  that  runway  (rounded  nearest  100  foot),  and  that  is  at  least 200 feet above terrain and obstructions. 3.3.2.5.4.2.  When  the  descent  point  falls  between  the  FAF  and  the  IF,  draw  the final and intermediate primary trapezoids from the LAAS exempt area outward to the descent point. 3.3.2.5.4.2.1.  Assign  an  altitude  for  LAAS  processing  within  the  final primary trapezoid IAW paragraph  3.3.2.5.4.1.1. 3.3.2.5.4.2.2.  Assign an altitude for LAAS processing within the intermediate primary  trapezoid  that  is  no  lower  than  100  feet  below  the  lowest  published FAF  crossing  altitude  for  that  runway,  and  that  is  at  least  300  feet  above terrain and obstructions. 3.3.2.5.4.3.  When  the  descent  point  falls  between  the  IF  and  the  IAF,  draw  the final,  intermediate  and  initial  primary  trapezoids  from  the  LAAS  exempt  area outward to the descent point. 3.3.2.5.4.3.1.  Assign  an  altitude  for  LAAS  processing  within  the  final  and intermediate  primary   3.3.2.5.4.1.1  and  3.3.2.5.4.2.2. IAW  paragraph trapezoid 3.3.2.5.4.3.2.  Assign  an  altitude  for  LAAS  processing  within  the  initial primary trapezoid that is no lower than 200 feet below the lowest published IF crossing altitude for that runway, and that is at least 300 feet above terrain and obstructions. 3.3.2.5.4.4.  For all other areas, assign an altitude for LAAS processing that is no lower  than  200  feet  below  the  MVA,  and  is  at  least  700  feet  above  terrain  and obstacles (1,700 feet in designated mountainous terrain). Note.  When two MVA altitudes are assigned to the same sector (paragraph 2.1.7.6., Note 1), the LAAS sector altitude will be based on the lowest MVA in the sector (T-2). AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 31 3.3.2.6.  LAAS sector data collection. 3.3.2.6.1.  Define  the  boundaries  of  each  LAAS  sector  by  two  ASR  bearings  (start and end) and by two ranges (start  and end).  Depict all  LAAS sectors as either pie- shaped,  truncated  pie-shaped,  or  a  circle  around  the  point  of  origin  (ASR).    Using Figure  3.3  and  Figure  3.5  as  examples,  draw  bearings  to  encompass  all  areas identified in paragraph 3.2.3.1.5.  When able, combine bearings/ranges to reduce the number  of  bearings  and  ranges  used.    Ensure  continuous  sectors  do  not  cross  the  0 degree bearing or 360 degree bearings.  Split sectors crossing either the 0 or the 360 degree  bearing  into  two  sectors;  stop  the  first  sector  at  the  360  degree  bearing  and start the second sector at the 0 degree bearing.  Ensure the sector end bearings are at least 8 degrees from the start bearings and specified in whole degree increments. 3.3.2.6.2.  Using Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.6 as examples, draw arcs (ranges) centered on  the  ASR  antenna  to  encompass  areas  identified  in  paragraph  3.3.2.5.    On  the AADM, record arc ranges to the nearest .25 NM.  On the GTM, record arc ranges to the nearest whole NM.  Ensure the sector end range  is at least 4 NMs from the start range and specified in no less than .25 NM increments. 3.3.2.6.3.  Up  to  128  sectors  may  be  defined  using  azimuth  and  range  start  –  end combinations.  On complicated charts, it may be necessary to make compromises to conserve bearings and ranges from the ASR antenna.  The geographic boundaries of each  altitude  warning  sector  in  the  map  are  defined  by  two  azimuth  boundaries  and range boundaries (range start and range end).  The map for a given site may include up to 32 different azimuth boundaries and up to 32 different range boundaries.  Each azimuth  boundary  value  or  range  boundary  value  may  be  used  as  the  start  or  stop azimuth  limit  for  a  number  of  different  sectors.    No  more  than  128  sectors  can  be defined.    Take  appropriate  action  to  remain  within  this  number,  but  in  no  case  will aircraft operate below the MVA without proper LAAS processing (T-2). 3.3.2.6.4.  Label the LAAS processing altitude for each sector and transfer to the AF IMT 3646. 3.3.2.7.  AF IMT 3646 completion instructions: 3.3.2.7.1.  Section  1-  FACILITY.    On  the  first  line,  enter  the  four-letter  ICAO identifier  for  the  ASR  facility  (e.g.  KTIK).    On  the  second  line,  enter  the  unit  and location.  Enter the name and Defense System Network (DSN) phone number of the person  submitting  the  information.    Enter  the  name  and  DSN  phone  number  of  the person at the MAJCOM level who reviewed the package. 3.3.2.7.2.  Section  3  -  ANTENNA  DATA.    Enter  the  latitude  and  longitude  of  the radar antenna to the nearest arc second.  Enter the slave angle (MV of record) of the radar  antenna  to  the  nearest  1/10th  degree  and  indicate  antenna  magnetic  variation east or west. 3.3.2.7.3.  Section  5  -  TRANSITION  ALTITUDE.    Enter  the  transition  altitude  in hundreds of feet above MSL. 3.3.2.7.4.  Section  6  -  BASELINE  ALTITUDE.    Enter  the  lowest  MSL  altitude  that activates  LAAS  processing.    This  is  the  default  LAAS  processing  altitude  for  areas 32 AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 not otherwise specifically defined.  The baseline altitude is the lowest safe altitude for all  areas  not  included  in  a  programmed  map  segment,  or  zero  if  there  are  expected significant areas where low altitude alert alarms would activate for legitimate reasons, but are not of concern.  Entering an altitude equal to or lower than the actual surface elevation in a segment means the LAAS alarm  never activates in that area (i.e. low altitude training areas and nearby airports not serviced by the facility). 3.3.2.7.5.  Section 8 - SEGMENT DATA.  For ease of future data modification, enter each identified segment in some order.  Identify the exact order by segment number on  all  maps  and  drawings  submitted  with  the  LAAS  package.    Begin  with  001  and proceed sequentially to the system limit of 128. 3.3.2.7.5.1.  Azimuth  Start.    Enter  the  segment-starting  azimuth  (also  called  the “left” azimuth) to the nearest whole degree.  The start azimuth is the one the plan position  indicator  (PPI)  sweep  passes  first  as  it  rotates  from  the  ASR  magnetic 360 bearing in a clockwise direction.  Use magnetic 360 bearing for due north. 3.3.2.7.5.2.  Azimuth  End.    Enter  the  segment-ending  azimuth  (also  called  the “right” azimuth) to the nearest whole degree.  The end azimuth is the azimuth the PPI  sweep  passes  last  as  it  rotates  from  the  ASR  magnetic  360  bearing  in  a clockwise  direction.    Ensure  this  value  is  at  least  8  degrees  greater  than  the segment start azimuth. 3.3.2.7.5.3.  Range  Start.    Enter  the  segment  range  closest  to  the  antenna  to  the nearest 0.25 NM increment. 3.3.2.7.5.4.  Range End.  Enter the segment range farthest from the antenna to the nearest  0.25 NM increment.  Ensure this range is  at  least  4 NM greater than the segment start range. 3.3.2.7.5.5.  Altitude.    Enter  the  lowest  altitude  at  which  an  aircraft  may  operate without activating the LAAS.  Enter this data in hundreds of feet (e.g., enter 2800 as 28).  Enter an altitude of 25,500 or above as 255 (the system maximum). 3.3.3.  LAAS  Associated  with  Mobile  and  Selected  Fixed  Radar  Systems.    The  following information pertains only to LAAS associated with AN/GPN-12, AN/GPN-20, AN/TPN-19, or AN/MPN-14 radars. 3.3.3.1.  Function.  This LAAS feature operates identically to the DBRITE LAAS except that only one code can be inhibited. 3.3.3.2.  Data Submission.  Packages include AADM and GTM, and a completed LAAS Data Collection Sheet for Mobile and Selected Fixed Radar Systems (Table 3.2).  Take the following action for: 3.3.3.2.1.  AN/GPN-12  and  AN/GPN-20  Fixed  facilities  (i.e.,  Aviano  AB,  Dobbins ARB,  Incirlik  AB,  Soto  Cano  AB,  and  Thule  AB).    Provide  approved  data  to  radar maintenance personnel for input into the 980B computer. 3.3.3.2.2.  AN/MPN-14 and AN/TPN-19 Mobile facilities.  MAJCOM TERPS office forwards  approved  LAAS  data  to  AFFSA/XS,  which  produces  programmable  read-only memory (PROM) chips.  Submit data for mobile facilities at least 30 days prior to the desired effective date. AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 33 3.3.3.3.  Data  Collection  and  Package  Development.    Draw  LAAS  charts  for  these systems in the same manner as for DBRITE LAAS except the chart design accounts for different bearing and range restrictions based on equipment limitations. 3.3.3.4.  Complete  LAAS  Data  Collection  Sheet  for  Mobile  and  selected  Fixed  Radar Systems (Table 3.2) as follows: 3.3.3.4.1.  SITE  NAME:    Enter  the  four-letter  ICAO  identifier  and  name  for  the facility. 3.3.3.4.2.  DATE:  Enter the unit-level submission date in the format dd-mmm-yyyy. 3.3.3.4.3.  MAGNETIC  VARIATION  (MV):    Enter  the  MV  of  record  of  the  radar antenna to the nearest 1/10th degree and indicate the antenna magnetic variation east or west. 3.3.3.4.4.  REVISION:  Enter the revision number if known. 3.3.3.4.5.  SECTOR #:  Enter each identified sector in order.  Identify the exact order by  sector  number  on  all  maps  and  drawings  submitted  with  the  LAAS  package.  Begin with 001 and proceed sequentially to the system limit of 128. 3.3.3.4.5.1.  Range  Start.    Enter  the  sector  range  closest  to  the  antenna  to  the nearest whole NM. 3.3.3.4.5.2.  Range Stop.   Enter the sector range  farthest  from the antenna to  the nearest whole NM.  Ensure this range is at least 2 NM greater than the sector start range. 3.3.3.4.5.3.  Azimuth  Start.    Enter  the  sector-starting  azimuth  (also  called  the “left” azimuth) to the nearest whole degree.  The start azimuth is the one the PPI sweep passes first as it rotates from the ASR magnetic 360 bearing in a clockwise direction.  Use magnetic 360 bearing for due north. 3.3.3.4.5.4.  Azimuth  Stop.    Enter  the  sector  ending  azimuth  (also  called  the “right” azimuth) to the nearest whole degree.  The stop azimuth is the azimuth the PPI  sweep  passes  last  as  it  rotates  from  the  ASR  magnetic  360  bearing  in  a clockwise  direction.    Ensure  this  value  is  at  least  4  degrees  greater  than  the segment start azimuth.  Use magnetic 360 bearing for due north. 3.3.3.4.5.5.  MINIMUM ALTITUDE:  Enter the lowest MSL altitude at which an aircraft may operate without activating the LAAS.  Enter this data in hundreds of feet. 3.3.3.4.5.6.

Diverse Vector Area. 4.1.1.  When  requested  by  IFR  facility  management  or  host  nation  aviation  authorities,  the TERPS  authority  will  use  GPD,  FAAO  8260.3,  Volume  4  and  the  following  guidance  to develop a DVA (T-1).   Exception:  When an operational  advantage can be gained, manual application  of  FAAO  8260.56,  Diverse  Vector  Area  (DVA)  Evaluation  is  authorized.  Prepare  a  DVA  package  regardless  of  the  diverse  departure  obstacle  assessment  results.  Coordination  with  IFR  facility  management  and  the  AOF/CC  is  documented  by  obtaining their  signatures  on  the  AF  Form  4342,  Approach/Departure  Signature  Page.    MAJCOM TERPS review and approval is required prior to DVA implementation.  DVAs do not require flight inspection. Note:  When the USAF provides IFR air traffic services to an airport that the FAA has TERPS responsibilities, contact the appropriate FAA instrument procedure designer for a list of the non-Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) penetrations of the diverse departure assessment area for each runway.  These results will include the location, description, and elevation of all 40:1 Obstacle Clearance Surface (OCS) penetrations (T-1).  USAF TERPS will use this information when developing the DVA (T-1). 4.2.  DVA Design Methods: 4.2.1.  Establish  sectors  with  or  without  a  climb  gradient  where  radar  vectoring  is  allowed.  Include  the  horizontal  accuracy  for  the  penetrating  obstacle(s)  when  establishing  sector boundaries. 4.2.1.1.  Prohibited areas within the DVA shall be depicted on a radar video map (T-2). 4.2.1.2.  Areas  outside  of  established  prohibited  areas  within  the  DVA  are  “free  vector areas”. 4.2.1.3.  Ensure  sector  boundaries  are  established  at  least  3  NM  from  the  penetrating obstacle when the penetrating obstacle is less than 40 NM from the radar antenna. 4.2.1.4.  Ensure  sector  boundaries  are  established  at  least  5  NM  from  the  penetrating obstacle when the penetrating obstacle is 40 NM or more from the radar antenna. 4.2.1.5.  Sectors  with  penetrations  to  the  OCS,  other  than  low,  close-in  obstacles,  that encompass the departure runway or in areas where the departing aircraft will be vectored immediately after departure will disqualify that runway from DVA consideration unless paragraph  4.2.3.  is  applied  and  the  climb  gradient  eliminates  the  need  to  isolate  the penetrating obstacle (paragraph 4.2.2). Note: The DVA must accommodate a climb to 400 feet above the departure end of runway (DER) prior to any turns. Note:  The DVA must accommodate a climb to 400 feet above the departure end of runway (DER) prior to any turns (T-1). 36 AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 4.2.2.  Isolate the penetrating obstacle(s).  Include the horizontal accuracy for the penetrating obstacle(s) when establishing the boundary of the buffered area. 4.2.2.1.  When isolating obstacles, the boundary of the buffered area shall be established 3 NM or 5 NM when the obstruction is 40 NM or more from the radar antenna (T-1). 4.2.2.2.  When  operating  with  multi-sensor  mosaic  radar  systems  or  with  a  CENRAP, apply a 5 NM buffer area around all penetrating obstacles throughout the entire DVA. 4.2.3.  Develop  a  climb  gradient  (CG).    CGs  associated  with  the  DVA  shall  be  calculated IAW AFI 11-230, paragraph 1.16.6 (T-2).  Design the DVA to  eliminate vectoring through multiple sectors that require different CGs. 4.3.  When  the  DVA  is  complete,  provide  the  radar  facility  manager  all  required restrictions to include a statement that turns  prior to the aircraft reaching 400 feet above DER are not authorized.  Include the dimensions of the entire DVA; describe each DVA sector and buffered area and any required CG.  Provide the MSL height of any isolated obstruction plus the  obstacle  accuracy.    The  facility  manager    uses  this  information  to  describe  the  DVA adequately to ATC in a facility operating instruction. AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 37 Chapter 5 TERPS SUPPORT OF USAF NON-RADAR PROGRAMS 5.1.  General:  Non-radar  programs  at  USAF  Air  Traffic  Facilities  are  the  responsibility  of  the IFR  Facility  Manager.    Non-radar  programs  are  developed/maintained  in  concert  with  the supporting TERPS authority.  This TERPS authority may be located locally or at the MAJCOM. Note 1. Most TERPS designers are not certified in the IFR facilities they support and may have no practical experience working in a non-radar environment. However, they do have the ability to plot NAVAIDs, holding patterns, radials, Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) points, fixes, transfer of control points, airspace boundaries, arcs about NAVAIDs, and airspace to be protected, etc., as requested by facility management. Note 2. See Figure 5.1 for an example of a non-radar drawing and AFI 13-204 Volume 3 for non-radar board content. 5.2.  IFR  Facility  Manager  .    During  the  non-radar  program  development,  the  IFR  facility manager shall contact the TERPS authority and request support (T-2). 5.3.  IFR Facility Manager will supply the following as applicable: 5.3.1.  Depiction of any current non-radar board (T-2). 5.3.2.  Current non-radar program details (T-2). 5.3.3.  List of requested  holding fixes, to  include minimum  and maximum  holding altitudes (T-2). 5.3.4.  List  of  departure  routings  (NAVAID  radials)  and  or  Standard  Instrument  Departures (SIDs) for each runway, to include altitudes and associated transfer of control points (T-2). 5.3.5.  List  of  arrival  routings  (NAVAID  radials)  or  Standard  Terminal  Arrival  Routes (STARs)  for  each  runway,  with  required  altitudes  and  any  associated  transfer  of  control points (T-2). 5.3.6.  List of instrument procedures required to support non-radar operations for each airport and runway (T-2). 5.3.7.  List of NAVAIDs required to support the non-radar program (T-2). 5.3.8.  Airspace  description  (Radar  Approach  Control  (RAPCON)  delegated,  adjacent  ATC facility and SUA) (T-2). 5.3.9.  Copies  of  Letters  of  Agreement  with  adjacent  facilities  that  describe  actions  during radar outages (T-2). 38 AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 Figure 5.1.  Non-Radar Board Example 5.4.  TERPS  Authority  (Unit  or  MAJCOM).  When  requested  by  the  IFR  Facility  Manager, TERPS will plot: 5.4.1.  On appropriate scale aeronautical chart (electronically or manually) the requested non- radar routings (radials, arc, SIDs, approaches, missed approach segments, etc.) (T-2).  Note: When plotting radials, use the MV assigned to the NAVAID.  files,  plastic  holding 5.4.2.2.  When  drawing  the  airspace  to  be  protected  around  a  holding  pattern,  use  GPD shape the  appropriate templates/patterns  IAW  FAAO  7130.3  Holding  Pattern  Criteria,  or  PANS-Ops/NATO criteria (T-1). templates,  or  manually  draw 5.4.3.  Apply  FAAO  JO  7110.65  to  display  airspace  to  be  protected  for  arrival/departure routings, and arcs about NAVAIDs (T-1). 5.4.4.  Assist  ATC  to  determine  DME  points  where  lateral  separation  stops  and  vertical separation must exist (T-2). 5.4.5.  Assist ATC to validate or develop diverging courses for non-radar routings as required (T-2). AFMAN13-215V2  6 FEBRUARY 2014 39 5.4.6.  Validate routings, altitudes and holding against the MAJCOM approved MIFRAC for each NAVAID (T-2). 5.4.7.  Assist  ATC  to  de-conflict  the  airspace  to  be  protected  around  non-radar  routings, holding  patterns,  approaches,  missed  approaches,  and  SIDs  as  requested  by  facility management (T-2). 5.4.8.  Clearly  label  all  NAVAIDs,  radials  (magnetic),  arcs  about  the  NAVAIDs,  fixes (include  coordinates),  holding  airspace  with  minimum  and  maximum  authorized  altitudes, and airspeed, as required (T-2). 5.4.9.  Forward the completed scale drawing to the requesting IFR Facility Manager (T-2).  HARRY C.
