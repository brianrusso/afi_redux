Overview.  AMC  Office  of  the  Command  Surgeon  (SG)  establishes  the  principles  for system-wide  organization,  equipment,  training,  and  clinical  standards  for  the  air  transport  of critically injured/ill patients – en route critical care.  En route critical care represents a family of critical  care  Unit  Type  Codes  (UTC),  and  non-UTC  special  medical  transport  capabilities,  that share  common  core  training  and  are  organized,  trained,  and  equipped  (OT&E)  to  provide advanced,  complex  medical  en  route  care  in  the  aerospace  environment.  Total  Force,  multi-command, and joint-service coordination ensures standards for system-wide en route critical care capabilities, personnel and training requirements, mission support requirements, clinical and in-flight care, team and individual performance, and critical care air transport process improvement. 1.1.1.  “AE”  refers  to  the  Air  Force  system  providing  time-sensitive  en  route  care  to regulated patients to and between medical treatment facilities; and, “en route care” refers to transitory  medical  care  including  AE,  patient  holding  and  staging  capabilities  during transport  from  the  site  of  injury  or  onset  of  disease,  through  successive  capabilities  of medical care, to a medical treatment facility that can meet the needs of the patient. 1.1.2.  En route critical care capabilities include the following UTCs:  FFCCT – Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT), FFTCT – Tactical Critical Care Evacuation Team (TCCET), and  FFTCS  –  Tactical  Critical  Care  Evacuation  Team  Surgical  Augmentation;  as  well  as several non-UTC special medical  attendant teams such as, Lung Teams, Neonatal  Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Teams, US Army Burn Teams, etc.  This instruction will primarily address the organization, mission, scope, practice, and requirements for USAF en route critical care UTCs.    Special  medical  transport  (non-UTC  or  AFSOC)  capabilities  should  use  this instruction as information and guidance where applicable. 1.2.  Critical  Care  –  Resuscitative  Care.  Critical  care  medicine  and  intensive  care  medicine are  branches  of  medical  practice  focused  on  the  provision  of  life  support  or  organ  support  in patients  who  are  acutely  or  critically  injured  or  ill  and  who  require  extensive  monitoring, continuous care and treatment, and interventions to sustain life.  Resuscitative care encompasses the aggressive management of life and limb threatening injuries through interventions including emergency medical treatment, advanced trauma management, and life-saving surgery to enable a patient to tolerate transport to the next level of care.  For the purpose of this instruction, “Critical Care” encompasses all aspects of resuscitative and critical care such as that provided in medical treatment  facilities  equipped  with  intensive  care  units  (ICU)  and/or  Emergency  Departments (ED).  Common equipment in these hospital critical care units includes mechanical ventilators to assist breathing through an endotracheal tube or a tracheotomy, cardiac monitors, defibrillators, dialysis equipment, equipment for the constant monitoring of bodily functions, intravenous lines, feeding tubes, nasogastric tubes, suction pumps, drains, catheters, and a wide assortment of drugs to  treat  the primary condition(s) for hospitalization.  Medically induced  comas, analgesics, and induced  sedation  are  common  tools  designed  to  reduce  agitation,  pain,  anxiety,  and  prevent secondary infections.  Medical staff in hospital critical care settings typically include intensivist physicians with training in critical care, pulmonology, internal medicine, surgery, anesthesia, or emergency  medicine.    The  hospital  critical  care  staff  also  typically  includes  specially  trained 6 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 critical care registered nurses, registered respiratory therapists, as well as nurse practitioners and physician  assistants  with  specialized  training,  certified  nursing  assistants,  Emergency  Medical Technician – Paramedic (EMT-P) and other medical support personnel. 1.3.  En  Route  Care  Capability.  “The  purpose  of  an  en  route  care  (ERC)  capability  is  the continuation  of  care  during  movement  (evacuation)  without  clinically  compromising  the patient’s condition”  (Joint  Publication 4-02, Health Service Support, 26 July 2012, p.  I-6).   En route  critical  care  capabilities  expand  on  this  definition  by  providing  advanced  medical interventions  during  evacuation  with  the  intent  on  improving  a  patient’s  condition.    Patient movement  (PM)  involves  transient  medical  care  as  well  as  patient  holding  and  staging  during transport  from  the  site  of  injury  or  onset  of  disease,  through  sequential  capabilities  of  medical care,  to  a  medical  treatment  facility  that  can  meet  the  needs  of  the  patient.    Each  Service component  is  responsible  for  an  organic  PM  capability  for  evacuation  from  point  of  injury  to initial treatment at a health care facility. 1.3.1.  Today’s  lethal  battlefield,  with  the  reduced  medical  footprint  forward,  and  the evacuate and replace philosophy, place a high demand on the en route care capabilities of all Services.      Future  conflicts  will  likely  pose  increased  constraints  on  the  size  of  theater medical support resources which will increase requirements to move less stable casualties out of the Main Battle Area.  Consequently, PM capabilities are even more vital than in the past and  Service  medical  elements  must  integrate  with  aerial  lift  operations,  as  well  as  with  the associated capabilities of our Nation’s allies and coalition partners. 1.4.  En  Route  Critical  Care  Concept.  The addition  of an en route critical  care  capability on aircraft  has  added  a  revolutionary  dimension  to  evacuation  missions.    With  augmentation  by ERCC  teams,  the  aeromedical  evacuation  system  serves  as  a  distributive  medical  treatment facility  –  a  “flying  hospital”  –  along  a  seamless  en-route  system  of  ever-increasing  medical capability from the point of injury (POI) to the rehabilitation medical facility.  Specially-trained en route critical care medical personnel care for critically injured/ill patients while in-transit to a medical  treatment  facility  –  usually  one  providing  focused  medical  treatment  and/or  a  higher level of medical care than the patient’s originating location.  This capability ensures the level of life-sustaining medical care for critically ill and injured patients during transport by air does not diminish  and  in  most  cases  projects  the  level  of  care  of  the  receiving  MTF  to  the  embarkation point.  This specialized mission requires medical professionals distinctly skilled and experienced in the practice of critical care.  Expert, knowledgeable professionals in critical care practice yield positive  patient  outcomes  with  fewer  patient  complications.    These  factors  are  decisive  in  the environment in which ERCC teams perform their mission:  aircraft at altitude  – a situation that complicates providing the kind of highly-specialized patient care required in an emergency room or ICU. 1.5.  En Route Critical Care Mission.  ERCC UTCs are a limited, rapidly-deployable resource available  in  selected  situations  to  supplement  patient  movement  capabilities.      ERCC  UTCs expand the scope of medical care provided to critically ill/injured patients who require damage control  resuscitation,  life-saving  interventions,  or  continuous  stabilization  and  advanced  care during  transport  in  either  an  intra-  or  inter-theater  mission  support  role.    One  or  more  ERCC UTCs may be employed with AE or ERC units based on operational requirements.  In general, ERCC UTCs are expected to project the level of care of the receiving MTF more so than level of care  of  the  originating  location.    When  deployed  in  support  of  Mobility  Air  Force  (MAF) missions, ERCC UTCs may be assigned or attached to an AE expeditionary element and become AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 7 an  Operations  Group  capability,  within  the  expeditionary  AE  element  command  structure.  ERCC  UTCs  are  able  to  transport  critically  ill  or  injured  patients  utilizing  a  variety  of  aircraft platforms. 1.5.1.  En route critical care UTCs are designed to be flexible in response and are employed across the full spectrum of operations.  This includes Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) operations  ranging  from  in-garrison  care  to  homeland  security,  Defense  Support  of  Civil Authorities  (DSCA)  to  worldwide  humanitarian  relief,  small-scale  contingencies  (SSCs) through  major  theater  war  (MTW),  and  any  other  operational  tasking  where  their  unique aeromedical skill set is required. 1.6.  En  Route  Critical  Care  Teams  –  Capabilities  and  Compositions  (Personnel UTCs).  Grade and skill level substitutions are authorized per AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and  Execution,  and  War  Mobilization  Plan  (WMP-1),  Air  Force  Medical  Service  Supplement.  Exception of substitution policy requires AMC/SG approval.  ERCC personnel are not trained to interface  with  aircraft  systems  and  must  be  tasked  with  appropriate  service-specific  personnel capable of interfacing between ERCC team/equipment and airframe’s crew/systems. 1.6.1.  UTC FFCCT, Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT). 1.6.1.1.  UTC  FFCCT,  in  conjunction  with  the  CCATT  equipment  package,  UTC FFCC4, provides care for a maximum patient load of up to three high-acuity patients, or up  to  six  lower-acuity  stabilized  patients;  loads  are  dependent  on  patient  acuity  levels.  The  members  of  this  team  are  specially  trained  to  provide  critical  care/specialty  care during  aeromedical  transport.   FFCCT  team  offers  a  higher  level  of  care  to stabilized/stabilizing  patients  during  patient  movement  missions.    UTC  FFCCT  has  no stand-alone  electrical,  mechanical  or  oxygen  equipment.    Introduction  of  untreated  or unstable  patients  will  degrade  team  capability  and  deplete  resources  unless  augmented.  Note:    UTC  FFCCT is  considered the foundation capability of  all en route critical  care UTCs. 1.6.1.1.1.  A pediatric equipment augmentation kit, UTC FFCC2, provides additional equipment/supplies to the FFCC4 equipment UTC to support FFCCT when the team is required to transport pediatric patients. 1.6.2.  Tactical  Critical  Care  Transport  Capabilities.    Tactical  critical  care  provides  a trauma/critical  care  response  capability  to  augment  existing  patient  transport  means  for casualties  likely  to  benefit  from  advanced  damage  control  resuscitation,  life-saving interventions,  and  critical  care  during  unregulated  pre-hospital  and  intra-MTF  casualty movements.    Tactical  critical  care  differs  from  the  FFCCT  role  in  that,  typically,  tactical critical care teams move patients on unregulated missions where there is a greater demand for damage control resuscitation interventions versus intensive critical care required for patients on regulated AE missions. 1.6.2.1.  UTC FFTCT, Tactical Critical Care Evacuation Team (TCCET). 1.6.2.1.1.  UTC  FFTCT,  in  conjunction  with  equipment  package  UTC  FFTC1, provides  damage  control  resuscitation  and  critical  care  support  in  the  peri-surgical phase  of  care  across  the  spectrum  of  unregulated  into  regulated  portions  of  the  En Route  Care  (ERC)  system.    The  peri-surgical  phase  of  care  includes  the  care  of  the patient  prior  to  access  to  surgical  stabilization,  as  well  as  the  post-operative  patient 8 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 with  ongoing  stabilization  and  critical  care  needs.    FFTCT  is  primarily  designed  to augment  tactical  evacuation  assets  available  in  the  operational  theater.    The  FFTCT mission can be performed on rotary wing, fixed wing or other appropriate platforms.  FFTCT provides a higher level of damage control resuscitation (DCR) expertise and capability  than  currently  exists  on  unregulated  non-ERCCT  patient  movements  of casualties from POI and during intra-theater transfer between MTFs. 1.6.2.1.2.  FFTCT  is  employed  based  on  tasking  algorithms  (driven  by  the  potential clinical requirements of the patient) or by mission assessment indicating a reasonable likelihood  of  advanced  DCR  being  required.    FFTCT  provides  single  mission  care capability  to  support  up  to  three  severely  injured/high  acuity  patients  per  mission.  Resources made available by other medical capabilities supporting FFTCT can extend the length of time care can be provided.  FFTCT is comprised of medical personnel that are properly organized, trained, and equipped to execute intra-theater movement of casualties via tactical aircraft.  FFTCT and associated equipment may be pared and tailored  for  missions  based  upon  casualty  clinical  requirements  and  airframe limitations. 1.6.2.1.3.  FFTCT  may  augment  service-specific  personnel  capable  of  interfacing between  ERCC  team/equipment  and  the  respective  airframe’s  crew/systems,  or  the team  may  be  tasked  alongside  aeromedical  evacuation  crewmembers  (AECMs)  and CCATTs.    When  transporting  patients,  FFTCT  has  medical  lead  for  their  patients’ care. 1.7.  En  Route  Critical  Care  Special  Medical  Attendant  Teams  –  Capabilities  and Compositions (non-UTC). 1.7.1.  Lung Team.   The  Lung Team  is  a non-UTC  ERCC capability that  provides a higher and  more  sophisticated  level  of  critical  care  and  advanced  respiratory  capability  than  UTC FFCCT to manage patients with severe respiratory compromise/injury.  Due to the complex nature of its mission, the Lung Team is a medical center (Level 4/5) based resource available in  selected  situations  to  augment  the  patient  movement  system  after  a  patient  has  received essential  care  by  supported  forces  medical  personnel.    A  Lung  Team  may  be  comprised  of US Air Force personnel and/or other Service personnel. 1.7.2.  Extracorporeal  Membrane  Oxygenation  (ECMO)  Team.    ECMO  is  a  heart-lung bypass device which circulates and oxygenates the blood to support life while giving patients with complex cardiac conditions or diseased or damaged lungs a chance to heal.  An ECMO Team is comprised of physicians, nurses, and technicians specially trained in the utilization of ECMO technology.  The team is capable of transporting a single patient per mission.  The number of team members transporting a patient depends on the acuity and medical treatment needs of the patient. 1.7.3.  Neonatal  Intensive  Care  Unit  (NICU)  Team.    The  NICU  team  is  a  non-UTC  ERCC capability that provides advanced respiratory and critical care transport expertise specific  to the physiology and pathophysiology of the neonate and young infant, which are outside the scope of UTC FFCCT.  The NICU team is uniquely qualified to monitor and manage patients with  severe  respiratory  and  multisystem  compromise  in  transit  to  a  definitive  care destination. AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 9 1.7.4.  US  Army  Institute  of  Surgical  Research  (USAISR)  Burn  Transport  Team  (Burn Team).

For ERCC capabilities assigned to support evacuation platforms other than AE, guidance will be outlined in the operations order (OPORD). 2.8.  Contingency Operations. 12 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 2.8.1.  Air  Force  Forces  (AFFOR),  Theater  Command  Surgeon  (SG).  The  AFFOR/SG  is responsible for the quality of medical care provided within the AOR. 2.8.2.  The Director of Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR), the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR)  and/or  Joint  Forces  Air  Component  Commander’s  (JFACC)  are  continuing authority  for  air  mobility  operations  within  an  Area  of  Responsibility  (AOR)  coordinating with  all  commands  and  agencies  both  internal  and  external  to  the  joint  force.  The DIRMOBFOR  is  normally  under  ADCON  of  the  COMAFFOR  and  is  normally  a  senior officer with an extensive background in air mobility operations and is familiar with the AOR. The  DIRMOBFOR  provides,  on  behalf  of  the  COMAFFOR,  guidance  to  the  Air  Mobility Division  (AMD)  on  air  mobility  matters,  but  such  guidance  should  be  responsive  to  the timing and tempo of operations managed by the AOC director. 2.8.3.  AMD. The AMD plans, coordinates, tasks, and executes the air mobility mission. The AMD  is  located  in  the  AOC  in  the  deployed  environment  and  is  directed  by  the DIRMOBFOR.  Among  the  AMD’s  many  responsibilities,  it  coordinates  air  refueling planning, tasking, and scheduling to support inter-theater and intra-theater air operations. The AMD  also  ensures  intra-theater  air  mobility  missions  are  visible  in  the  AMC  standard command  and  control  system,  and  is  reflected  in  the  ATO.    The  AMD  remains  under  the control of the AOC director who manages the execution of operations for the COMAFFOR. 2.8.4.  AE  Control  Team  (AECT).  The  AECT  provides  operational  control  for  aeromedical elements  directing  and  managing  oversight  of  missions  originating  and  terminating  within the assigned theater of operations.  The AECT is the operational center for overall planning, coordinating and directing of all theater AE forces. 2.8.5.  Deployed  ERCC  UTCs  supporting  AE  forces  are  organized  within  the  constructs  of the Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) and are tailored based on the size and scope of the operation.  C2 of theater AE forces in contingency operations  is defined in the warning/execution/operation  order  (WARNORD/EXORD/OPORD).    AE  assets  may  be under  the  operational  control  (OPCON)  of  the  Joint  Force  Commander  (JFC)  through  the JFACC and, when not appointed as the JFACC, the COMAFFOR for administrative control (ADCON). 2.8.6.  When ERCC teams are deployed for contingency operations in support of a GCC, the ERCC  teams  may  fall  under  the  OPCON  and  Tactical  Control  (TACON)  of  the JFACC/COMAFFOR exercised through the Director of Mobility Forces-Air (DIRMOBFOR-AIR), and may be assigned to a deployed ERC evacuation element.  When deployed in direct support of AMC AE operations, ERCC teams fall under the OPCON or TACON of the 618 Air  and  Space  Operations  Center  (Tanker/Airlift  Control  Center)  (618  AOC  (TACC).  The 618 AOC coordinates the management and expectation of ERCC teams with the 18 AF/SG. Command  relationships  are  defined  in  the  warning/execution/deployment  order.    When tasked  for  a  non-traditional  en  route  critical  care  role,  the  team  may  not  necessarily  be assigned to an AE unit or Operations Group, but may be aligned under a different execution and command and control organization. 2.8.7.  AF Theater En Route Critical Care Director. During major contingency operations, the GCC  may  establish  a  Theater  En  Route  Critical  Care  Director  to  oversee  en  route  critical care  operations  within  the  region.  This  position  will  be  filled  by  a  qualified  AF  ERCC member.    In  coordination  with  AMC/SGK,  the  HQ  AF/SG  CCAT  Consultant  will  select  a AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 13 qualified  individual  for  the  position  from  a  list  of  candidates  to  be  maintained  by  the consultant. Generally, the Theater En Route Critical Care Director will be assigned to the Air Force  Forces  (AFFOR)/SG staff. The  Theater En Route Critical  Care Director serves as an advisor to Combatant Command Surgeon (CCMD/SG) and AFFOR/SG for the development, utilization, and optimization of a theater-wide en route critical care capability. This includes UTCs  FFCCT,  FFTCT  and  other  special  en  route  critical  care  capabilities  such  as  Lung Teams,  as well as other  special and coalition medical  critical  care air transport capabilities.  The  Theater  En  Route  Critical  Care  Director  serves  as  an  authoritative  consultant  to  the AECT on the utilization of ERCC teams. The Theater En Route Critical  Care Director also serves  as  a  consultant  to  the  Theater  Validating  Flight  Surgeon  (TVFS)  regarding  clinical considerations  for  critical  care  transport,  but  does  not  validate  Patient  Movement  Requests (PMRs) – validation authority is the responsibility of the TVFS. 2.8.7.1.  The Theater En Route Critical Care Director will meet the same pre-deployment training and currency requirements as other personnel deploying within the FFCCT UTC. The  Theater  En  Route  Critical  Care  Director  will  be  provided  operational  support  flier (9C)  aeronautical  orders  (AOs)  allowing  him/her  to  travel  to  locations  with  deployed ERCC  assets  as  needed  and  in  coordination  with  AFFOR/SG.  To  evaluate  the  clinical operations of the AOR en route critical care system, the Theater En Route Critical Care Director is authorized to participate in intra-theater or inter-theater AE missions and has the  same  priority  as  ERCC  teams  and  AE  crews  to  return  to  the  point  of  origin  at  the conclusion of these missions. 2.8.8.  AE  Element  CCATT/ERCC  Director.    When  deployed,  one  or  more  ERCC  UTCs (typically  FFCCT)  may  be  attached/assigned  to  a  deployed  expeditionary  AE  element.  The AE  element  commander  will  appoint  a  unit  CCATT/ERCC  Director  for  management  and oversight  of all assigned ERCC teams  and to serve as team  liaison  to/for the AE command section.  The  CCATT/ERCC  Director  reports  directly  to  the  AE  element  commander  and  is integrated  into  the  AE  element  executive  leadership  structure  at  the  equivalent  level  of  the Director of Operations (DO) and the Chief Nurse. The unit CCATT/ERCC Director will be a physician  –  that  physician  may  be  of  lesser  rank  but  greater  CCATT  experience.  The CCATT/ERCC Director will be responsible for managing each of the ERCC teams assigned to  the  AE  element,  establishing  the  rotational  schedule,  reviewing  clinical  processes,  act  as liaison  with  local  ground  medical  treatment  facility  to  establish  processes  for  critical  care clinical  sustainment,  and  be  the  mediator  for  all  other  team  issues.    If  TCCET  UTCs  are attached to the deployed expeditionary AE element, TCCET personnel will fall under the unit CCATT/ERCC Director for management and oversight. 2.8.9.  Team Chief.  During mission execution, the physician on the ERCC team is the team lead  and  the  clinical  authority  for  patients  assigned  to  the  team;  and,  with  the  other  team members, is responsible for documenting and providing care.  The physician may be called upon to consult and/or assist in the care of other patients under the direct care of the AE crew on board. Any participation by the physician in the care of a patient assigned to the AE crew must  be  documented  on  the  AE  patient  medical  record  and  a  DD  Form  2852,  Patient Movement Event/Near Miss Report.  For non-AE missions (no MCD/AECMs on board), the ERCC  Team  Chief  will  ensure  the  documentation  is  accomplished.  Significant  change  in status  will be communicated to  the C2 agency and Patient  Movement Requirements Center (PMRC) (if regulated patient) governing the mission. When in-flight, the ERCC team works 14 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 with  and  receives  mission  operational  direction  from  the  MCD  or  non-AE  platform comparable  member  (e.g.,  Combat  Search  and  Rescue  (CSAR)  Pararescue  Jumper  (PJ), DUSTOFF Senior Flight Medic, etc.). AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 15 Chapter 3 EN ROUTE CRITICAL CARE UTC ASSIGNMENT 3.1.  En Route Critical Care Team Candidate Selection. 3.1.1.  All  candidates  for  ERCC  UTC  assignment  and  duty  undergo  a  position-specific clinical  skill  validation  process  administered  by  the  US  Air  Force  School  of  Aerospace Medicine  (USAFSAM),  Air  Force  Expeditionary  Medical  Skills  Institute  (AFEMSI),  under the authority and direction of AMC/SG.  (Reference AFI 41-106) 3.1.2.  Medical  unit  commanders  with  ERCC  UTCs  assigned  are  responsible  for  evaluating assigned  personnel  for  nomination  to  an  ERCC  UTC  so  that  only  clinically  competent personnel are assigned;  ensuring ERCC UTC-assigned personnel are clinically experienced, trained and equipped for this vital mission. Commanders are also responsible for maintaining the  clinical  capability  of  assigned  ERCC  teams  to  provide  medical  care  during  transport  of critically  ill  or  injured  patients  in  support  of  war  operations,  humanitarian  assistance, homeland  security/defense  operations,  disaster  response,  and  other  taskings.    Commanders screen  assigned  medical  personnel  for  eligible  candidates  holding  primary  or  allowable substitution  AFSCs  for  nomination  to  a  position  on  ERCC  UTCs.    Note:    Air  Reserve Component  (ARC)  ERCC  UTC  assignments  may  be  determined  at  the  time  of  accession.  ARC  medical  unit  commanders  with  ERCC  UTCs  are  responsible  for  ensuring  timely training and sustained clinical competence of all ERCC UTC assigned personnel. 3.1.3.  Candidates  for  ERCC  UTC  membership  must  be  world-wide  qualified  and  able  to meet the requirements for physician, nurse, or technician positions (respectively) as set forth in paragraph 3.2 below. 3.1.4.  The critical care clinical skill validation process does not remove the responsibility for selecting,  training,  and  preparing  members  for  assignment  to  UTCs  from  the  commander.  The  process  is  an  enhancement  to  the  medical  UTC  assignment  system  to  ensure  that  only the most highly skilled  medical  professionals  are assigned to  ERCC UTCs.  The validation process  is  also  designed  to  assist  commanders  in  determining  what  further  experience  and training  a  prospective  UTC  candidate  must  obtain  in  order  to  capably  perform  the  ERCC mission. 3.2.  Critical Care Clinical Skill Validation Application Process. 3.2.1.  Clinical Skill Validation Application Package. Application packages must be prepared for  each  ERCC  UTC  candidate.

Cardiopulmonary Technicians will be current in BLS and ACLS. (Include copy of respective certificate for each applicable certification held.) 3.3.  Critical Care Skill/Experience Validation. 3.3.1.  Clinical  Validation  Committee  (CVC)  and  Review.    A  committee  composed  of experienced  ERCC  members  will  review  packages  for  recommended  nominees.    AFEMSI will  appoint  a  CVC  Medical  Director  to  lead  the  review  process  for  all  ERCC  UTC candidates.  The CVC Medical Director will be responsible for assigning CVC members and the clinical skills review process.  Any irresolvable conflicts between the CVC members will be  referred  to  the  CVC  Medical  Director.    The  clinical  skill  validation  process  will  be completed within a 2-week (10 working days) period. The CVC is required to expeditiously conduct and complete their assessment in order to avoid a delay in the commander’s ability to  make  timely  personnel  assignments  to  ERCC  UTCs.    The  CVC  is  composed  of experienced  ERCC  UTC  members  who  review  application  packages  for  candidates recommended  for  ERCC  UTC  assignment  –  physicians  review  physician  candidate applications,  nurses review cardiopulmonary technician applicants. When reviewing candidates from AFRC or the ANG, a qualified physician, critical care nurse, or cardiopulmonary technician representative from the  respective  air  reserve  component,  as  applicable,  will  be  a  member  of  the  clinical validation committee for the reserve component candidate. Members of the CVC will not be in  a candidate’s direct  chain  of command. Each  package will be assigned to  one lead CVC member for review and processing. A structured interview of the proposed member will be accomplished  by  a  member  of  the  CVC.  Two  additional  CVC  members  will  review  the package  concurrently.  Validation  status  will  be  assigned  by  a  consensus  of  the  three  CVC members.  Based  on  the  committee’s  decision,  a  candidate/candidate’s  commander  will receive a letter assigning one of the following: review  nurse  applicants,  cardiopulmonary technicians 3.3.1.1.  Approved  –  Confirms  eligibility  for  UTC  FFCCT  and  entry  into  the  CCAT Initial Course. CVC approval date must be entered into member’s record in MRDSS. 3.3.1.2.  Disapproved  –  Candidate  does  not  meet  eligibility  requirements  for  an  ERCC UTC. AFEMSI will immediately notify commanders on all candidates ineligible for UTC appointment.  Candidates  who  are  ineligible  for  ERCC  UTC  assignment  must  be immediately  removed  from  the  UTC  and  scheduled  course  attendance  cancelled.  Disapproval  letters  will  cite  the  factors  resulting  in  candidate  disapproval  and  explain what further experience and training a candidate must obtain in order to capably perform the respective UTC mission.  Ineligible applicants may appeal the decision through their unit commander to AMC/SG.  The appeal request must include a letter of rebuttal signed by  the  commander  fully  stating/supporting  justification  for  consideration  of  decision reversal, the original application package, and any additional associated documentation. AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 19 Chapter 4 OPERATIONS 4.1.  ERCC  Scope  of  Care.  ERCC  teams  provide  advanced  specialty  medical  capability  to evacuate  critically  ill/injured  patients  requiring  surgery,  resuscitation  or  advanced  care  during transport.    Patients  requiring  transport  by  an  ERCC  team  include  those  requiring  resuscitation, intensive  nursing  care,  constant  monitoring,  mechanical  ventilation,  frequent  therapeutic interventions,  or  other  medical  or  surgical  interventions  vital  to  sustain  life  limb  and  eyesight during  movement  of  the  patient.    A  wide  variety  of  adult  and  pediatric  patients  with  serious medical and surgical conditions may potentially require transport by ERCC teams. 4.1.1.  These  patients  are  usually  in  a  state  of  hemodynamic,  physiological  flux,  including patients  whose  resuscitation  may  still  be  in  evolution.    Prior  to  transport,  the  role  of  the ERCC team is to assess the patient’s ability to tolerate air transport and prepare the critically ill/injured  patient  for  movement.    The  ERCC  UTC  will  normally  originate  with  a  patient from  a  nearby/co-located  MTF  located  at  a  theater  ERC  hub.    ERCC  teams  may  also  be transported from an ERC hub to forward locations to pick up patients for transport to higher levels of care.  The ERCC team accompanies the patient from the originating facility to the aircraft  and  continue  to  monitor  and  intervene  during  in-flight  operations  as  required.  Specialized  ERCC  UTCs  with  training  in  pre-hospital  trauma  care  may  provide  primary stabilization, DCR, critical care, or damage control surgical intervention.  At the end of the mission, the ERCC team accompanies the patient from the aircraft to the destination facility and  continue  to  monitor  and  intervene  as  required  until  the  patient  is  handed-off  to destination facility medical staff. 4.2.  Range.  ERCC  UTCs  are  designed  to  be  flexible  in  response  and  could  be  employed  to move  critically  injured  or  ill  patients  across  the  spectrum  of  operations.    This  includes  AEF operations  ranging  from  in-garrison  care  to  homeland  security,  DSCA  to  worldwide humanitarian  relief,  small  scale  contingencies  through  major  theater  war,  and  any  other operational tasking where this unique patient care skill set is required.  Movement can occur on any appropriate platform and include patients regardless of whether or not they are validated or regulated. 4.3.  Force Health Protection.  Global engagement requires forces to rapidly deploy in different parts of the world at a moment’s notice.  It is assumed medical personnel may potentially operate in a biological or chemical environment.  People, systems, and facilities of supporting bases are essential to  the launch, recovery, and sustainment  of aerospace platforms, usually as part of an AEF.  Air Force medical services are crucial to base defense and resumption of operations during a  wide  spectrum  of  AEF  operations.    ERCC  teams  must  be  deployed  with  appropriate  training and individual protective equipment (IPE) to counter threats.  When deployed, whether as an AE component or supporting other medical transport operations, ERCC teams will be exposed to the same conditions as the members of the unit they are supporting and must be provided the same level and type of personal protective equipment (PPE). 4.4.  Mission Essential Items. 4.4.1.  When  flying  on  any  mission,  ERCC  UTC  members  will  have,  at  minimum,  the following items on hand:  (T-1) 20 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 4.4.1.1.  Identification (ID) card. 4.4.1.2.  Dog tags. 4.4.1.3.  Appropriate Aeronautical Order. 4.4.1.4.  NATO, TDY, and/or Deployment orders (as applicable). 4.4.1.5.  Government Travel Card. 4.4.1.6.  Official Government Passport.  Personnel assigned to ERCC UTCs are required to have a current and valid Official Government Passport (no-fee/maroon cover) on hand at all times in order to comply with country entry requirements specified in the Foreign Clearance  Manual  (also  referred  to  as  Electronic  Foreign  Clearance  Guide,  eFCG).  Failure to accomplish will result in mission restrictions.  Passport applications should be submitted  immediately  upon  assignment  to  ERCC  UTC.    Applications  for  passport renewals  should  begin  3  months  prior  to  passport  expiration  to  prevent  mission restriction.  (Note:  Do not use “tourist” passports with a blue cover.) 4.5.  ERCC  UTC  and  Special  Medical  Attendant  Team  Relationship  with  Aeromedical Evacuation  Crewmembers  (AECMs)/  En  Route  Care  Crewmembers  .  Personnel  assigned to ERCC UTCs are not considered a part of the AE aircrew UTC, FFQDE, and are not rated or non-rated  aircrew-members.    ERCC  UTC  members  are  operational  support  fliers.    Non-UTC members  of  ERCC  special  medical  attendant  teams  are  classed  as  medical  attendants.    (Note:  Reference AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, for guidance on rated Flight Surgeons performing ERCC duty.)  ERCC personnel are vital members of the USAF’s en route medical care capability during  deployments  and  patient  transport  missions.    When  assigned  or  attached  to  AE  or  ERC units, the AE or ERC unit commander is responsible for effective communication, coordination and integrity, and will ensure ERCC teams are supported. 4.5.1.  During missions utilizing ERCC UTC teams or ERCC special medical attendant teams to transport patients via AE, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) has operational control over all aspects of the AE mission.  The ERCC senior team physician is the team leader and has clinical  authority  of  the  assigned  patient(s)  during  the  mission.    The  ERCC  team  leader updates the MCD on any changes in the patient’s clinical status and will direct requests for changes in any aspect of the flight (i.e. cabin altitude or flight plan) to the MCD.  For ERCC UTCs  not  assigned  to  support  AE,  gaining  organization  C2  is  responsible  for  ensuring effective integration of ERCC members into the unit and the unit’s mission. 4.5.2.  During missions utilizing ERCC teams to transport patients on non-AE ERC missions (i.e., CASEVAC, MEDEVAC, etc.), the senior crewmember has operational control over the mission.    The  senior  ERCC  team  member  has  clinical  authority  of  the  assigned  patient(s) during the mission.  The ERCC team leader updates the senior crewmember on any changes in the patient’s clinical status and will direct requests for changes in any aspect of the flight (i.e.  cabin  altitude  or  flight  plan)  to  the  senior  crewmember.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  the senior  crewmember  and  the  ERCC  Team  Chief  assigned  to  a  particular  ERC  mission  to ensure team cohesiveness and integrity between ERCC teams and the flight crew.  For ERCC teams  assigned  to  support  ERC  units,  gaining  organization  C2  is  responsible  for  ensuring effective integration of ERCC members into the unit and the unit’s mission. AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 21 4.6.  Support.  ERCC  teams  receive  all  base  support  from  the  unit  of  attachment.    During deployment  operations,  the  gaining    unit  will  be  responsible  for  providing  all  required  support for  the  ERCC  teams  including  billeting,  food,  water,  shelter,  transportation,  medical  oxygen support,  communication  and  coordinate  resupply  of  medical  equipment  and  supplies,  and  any other items determined essential for the ERCC teams to accomplish their mission.  UTC FFEC1, Expeditionary  Support  Package,  has  been  designed  to  provide  essential  basic  shelter  and equipment storage for ERCC teams and AECMs deployed to secure, forward airfields in support of tactical operations where their presence exceeds requisite shelter-support capability at the host site. 4.6.1.  If a patient transport mission terminates at a location different from the host unit’s or deployed  unit’s location, the Aeromedical Evacuation Control Team (AECT) or applicable C2  agency  ensures  integrity  between  aircrew  members,  ERCC  team  members,  and  support personnel  is  maintained  until  all  have  returned  to  the  point  of  origin.    If  the  ERCC  team members  are  separated  from  the  flight  crew,  the  ERCC  team-chief  is  responsible  to  ensure required support by contacting the base command post and controlling C2 agency (i.e., 618 AOC, AMD).  The ERCC team chief ensures the originating unit command/administration is advised  of  latest  travel  information,  plan,  limitations,  and  obstacles  to  returning  to  point  of origin. 4.7.  Tasking and Employment. 4.7.1.  ERCC  Team  Utilization  –  Regulated  Critical  Care  Patients.    ERCC  teams  are  a limited,  rapidly  deployable  resource  available  in  selected  situations  to  enhance  patient movement  capability.    A  PMRC  VFS  validates  the  necessity  for  ERCC  patient  movement.  The  request  for  ERCC  teams  to  support  a  patient  movement  requirement  comes  through  a coordinated  effort  among  the  originating,  sending  physician,  PMRC  validating  flight surgeon, and destination accepting physician.  When a sending physician  believes ERCC is required for transport, this  is  reflected on the patient movement  request  (PMR).  Following review  of  the  PMR,  the  validating  flight  surgeon  will  either  concur  with  the  request  or collaborate  with  the  sending  physician  to  arrive  at  a  final  determination.    The  validating flight surgeon also has the option to require an ERCC team, even if not originally requested by  the  sending  physician.    In  the  case  of  complex  ERCC  patient  movements,  the  PMRC validating  flight  surgeon  will  collaborate  with  the  Theater  ERCC  Director,  sending physician,  accepting  physician,  and  the  transporting  ERCC  physician  when  planning  and coordinating a patient’s transfer.   Consultation between the sending physician, ERCC team physician,  the  PMRC  VFS  and/or  the  Theater  En  Route  Critical  Care  Director  will  be required  prior  to  mission  execution  to  determine  the  appropriate  provider  mix  to  transport neonatal and pediatric critical patients. 4.7.1.1.  Non-Critically Ill/Injured Patients.  The PMRC will not validate patients  whose condition would require a medical attendant because of the presence of an ERCC team on a  mission.    ERCC  teams  will  only  be  responsible  to  provide  care  for  the  patient(s) validated  as  requiring  an  ERCC  team  for  transport.    The  assignment  of  additional  non-critical patients to an ERCC team substantially reduces the capability of the ERCC team to provide care for assigned critical care patients.  Should a mission be diverted en-route to pick up additional critically injured or ill patients, the ERCC team may not be able to continue  to  provide  care  for  a  non-critical  patient.    Such  non-critical  patients  should  be validated with a medical attendant. 22 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 4.7.2.  Unregulated Critical Care Patients.  ERCC tasking for unregulated patient movement may be supported by fixed or rotary wing evacuation platforms.  Tasking may be initiated by a 9-Line MEDEVAC request, PMR Prime (12-line), or a Mass Casualty (MASCAL) PMR.  “Intelligent  tasking”  either  by  medical  assessment  or  defined  protocols  should  be  used  to assess the appropriateness of utilizing ERCC capabilities OT&E’d to assess, resuscitate and treat  unstable  casualties  for  specific  missions.    In  some  situations,  operational  constraints limiting  C2  visibility  of  casualties’/potential  casualties’  medical  condition  will  require proactive assignment of ERCC capabilities to an evacuation mission. 4.7.2.1.  These operating environments may require AE assets to evacuate patients from locations  where  the  ability  to  generate  and  evaluate  PMRs  utilizing  the  AE  system  is ineffective  or  impossible.    The  role  of  ERCC  providers  on  these  missions  includes “accepting physician” and/or medical authority. 4.7.2.2.  When security or operational conditions exist that would require casualties to be moved  immediately,  the  patient  may  be  moved  without  prior  PMRC  validation.  However,  a  Clearing  Flight  Surgeon  or  designated  medical  authority  clears  the  ERCC patients for transport.    In each case, the MCD contacts AECT prior to taxi in order to correct the manifest and the total number of personnel on board.  The AECT then notifies the PMRC. 4.7.3.  Mission Tasking.  Once the requirement to transport a critically injured or ill patient has been determined, the ERCC team may be tasked by the theater AECT, 618 AOC AE cell, or  other  ERC  PM  control  agencies  through  the  respective  command  chain  for  the  required mission.    Requirements  for  support  are  based  on  expected  casualties,  location,  available medical  capability,  and  en  route  care  requirements.    The  number  and  mix  of  personnel  are based on the requirement identified at execution. 4.7.3.1.  Tasking  ERCC  teams  for  AE  missions  mirrors  the  same  process  as  for  AE crews.  In determining the extent of a requirement for ERCC assets, the AECT considers capabilities  and  maximum  patient  loads  with  regard  for  acuity  of  patients  and  potential care  requirements.    The  AECT  consults  with  the  Theater  ERCC  Director  for  expert critical care clinical guidance when ERCC teams are tasked. 4.7.3.1.1.  High  acuity  patients  are  generally  stabilizing  or  stabilized  patients requiring  mechanical  ventilation,  multiple  vasoactive  medications,  ongoing resuscitation, or other advanced treatment modalities. 4.7.3.1.2.  Low  acuity  patients  are  generally  those  who  are  hemodynamically  stable but require hemodynamic monitoring and some form of more intensive care such as titration of vasoactive medications, ventilator management, monitoring of intracranial pressure, etc. 4.7.4.  Pediatric/Neonatal  Transports.    During  operations  where  ERCC  teams  are  deployed, there  may  be  occasions  when  it  is  necessary  to  transport  pediatric  patients.    UTC  FFCC4 does  not  provide  equipment  to  support  pediatric  patients.    A  pediatric  equipment augmentation  kit,  UTC  FFCC2,  has  been  developed  which  provides  additional equipment/supplies  to  FFCC4  equipment  to  support  FFCCT  when  a  team  is  required  to transport pediatric patients. If transport of pediatric patients is anticipated during operations, one or more of these  augmentation kits should  be requested by the Combatant Commander AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 23 (CCDR).    Consultation  between  the  sending  physician,  ERCC  team  physician,  Theater ERCC  Director  and  the  PMRC  validating  flight  surgeon  will  be  required  prior  to  mission execution considering such factors as patient acuity, transport care requirements, age, weight, and  size  of  patient  to  determine  the  ideal  support  necessary  to  transport  pediatric  critical patients. 4.7.4.1.  A  NICU  team  will  most  likely  be  notified  for  AE  missions  when  neonatal requirements  have  been  identified  for  patient  movement  from  the  originating  station.  These  are  extremely  limited  assets  typically  tasked  to  support  limited,  specific beneficiary  or  humanitarian  transports.    A  NICU  team  will  generally  be  utilized  to transport patients from birth up to three months old.  The limiting factor in determining a “maximum/minimum” patient age of three months is the size of the transport isolette. 4.7.5.  Non-Standard  Regulated  En  Route  Care  Missions.    For  patient  transports  with  an ERCC  team  utilizing  smaller,  space-limited  airframes  such  as  C-21,  C-12,  etc.,  the evacuation platform  crew may be constrained due to weight and space limitations.  In cases of extensive patient care and support requirements, an ERCC team may be required to move a  patient  without  an  AECM  or  other  medical  crewmember.    In  such  cases,  prior  approval shall  be  obtained  from  MAJCOM  (COMAFFOR  when  applicable)/A3/DO  with  mission execution  authority  (reference  AFI  11-202,  Volume  3,  General  Flight  Rules)  for  regulated evacuations.  (T-1).  MAJCOM (COMAFFOR)/A3 should be informed that the ERCC team members  are  not  aircrew  and  are  not  qualified  to  interface  with  any  aircraft  systems  or portable oxygen systems or configure the interior of an aircraft to accept patients independent of  AECMs.    ERCC  allowance  standards  do  not  include  portable  oxygen  (PTLOX)  or  a portable  frequency  converter.    ERCC  members  are  not  qualified  to  operate  PTLOX  or portable frequency converters independent of AECMs.  In cases where the use of PTLOX or frequency  converter is  not  required, the ERCC team  operates under the  auspices of the on-board front-end crew and only operate the equipment using battery power.  When PTLOX or a frequency converter is required for the mission, a qualified AECM will be assigned to the mission for interface between aircraft systems and medical equipment.  ERCC team members need to be able to communicate the amperage requirement for equipment brought on board, what  equipment  may  operate  on  aircraft  (400Hz)  power,  and  what  equipment  must  use  a frequency  converter  when  plugged  in.    A  crewmember  qualified  in  the  particular  aircraft must brief the ERCC team on ground operations, flight safety, egress, loading/unloading, etc.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  ERCC  team  leader  to  ensure  members  are  adequately  briefed prior to the mission.  (T-2).  It may also be necessary to pare and tailor ERCC team personnel and/or  equipment.    The  ERCC  team  physician,  in  coordination  with  the  tasking  authority, evaluates  the  mission  requirements  to  ensure  patient  and  mission  needs  are  met  with  the appropriate team and equipment complement utilized. 4.7.6.  Non-AE Missions.  ERCC teams may be utilized on any patient transport of critically ill or injured patients in order to save life, limb or eyesight on opportune  aircraft (IAW AFI 11-401).  In such cases, care and caution must be exercised on the use of this limited asset.  Platforms include, but are not limited to, rotary wing aircraft, CV-22, C-212, C-23, HC-130, coalition  nation  aircraft,  and  other  aircraft  of  opportunity.    Support  for  critically  injured/ill patients  is  a  priority  but  should  be  systematically  weighed  against  over-arching  theater requirements, mission risk and threat conditions, and the appropriateness and availability of 24 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 other  assets  to  move  the  patient(s).    ERCC  personnel  may  transport  critically  ill  or  injured patients on non-AE missions when operational or patient requirements dictate. 4.7.6.1.  Utilization of ERCC teams on non-AE missions should be approved through the theater command and control agency governing theater ERCC.  (T-2).  ERCC teams are not  required  to  fly  with  AECMs  on  non-AE  missions.    For  ERCC  UTCs  trained  for unregulated  missions,  this  approval  can  be  assumed  by  the  tasking  of  the  UTC  to  the TACON of an unregulated evacuation  asset.  ERCC teams  will follow directions of the assigned aircraft crew on factors pertaining to operating on-board the particular aircraft.  Prior  to  transporting  patients  on  non-AE  missions,  ERCC  members  must  be  properly oriented and equipped for these missions, and briefed on ground operations, flight safety, egress,  patient  loading/unloading,  etc.  by  a  crewmember  qualified  in  the  particular aircraft.    (T-2).    Due  to  space  and  weight  limitations  on  some  airframes,  it  may  be necessary  to  pare  and  tailor  both  the  personnel  and  equipment.    The  ERCC  team physician,  in  close  coordination  with  the  tasking  authority,  evaluates  the  mission requirements  to  ensure  patient  and  mission  needs  are  met  with  whatever  team  and equipment  complement  is  utilized.  The  theater  command  and  control  agency  governing ERCC will ensure an alternate oxygen and electrical  source that is  approved for use on that aircraft is available if required as ERCC team members are not qualified to operate PTLOX  or  portable  frequency  converters.    The  ERCC  team  utilizes  the  oxygen  and electrical source that is used by the aircraft medical crewmember.  In cases where there is no medical crewmember support, the ERCC team operates medical equipment on battery only. 4.7.7.  Peacetime  Taskings.   “Peacetime”  (i.e.,  other  than  war  support  contingency operations)  taskings  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  President  of  the  United  States (POTUS)  support,  special  operations  support,  within  continental  United  States (CONUS)/outside  continental  United  States  (OCONUS)  beneficiary  transports,  DSCA,  i.e., hurricane evacuation, humanitarian assistance/disaster response, etc.  These taskings could be of short notice and may be brief or extended in duration.  ERCC team members must meet and  maintain  currency  in  all  training  requirements  stated  herein  to  perform  these  missions.  (T-1).    Missions  within  the  U.S.  Pacific  Command  (PACOM)  AOR  and  U.S.  European Command  (EUCOM)  AOR  will  be  managed  by  their  respective  AF  supporting  commands and/or assigned numbered air force (NAF).  An on-call schedule for ERCC teams required to support  DSCA  operations  has  been  established  by  AMC/SGX  and  distributed  to  all MAJCOMs/units with ERCC UTCs assigned. 4.7.7.1.  Disaster  Relief.    During  DSCA  operations  such  as  pre-  and  post-hurricane landfall  evacuations,  or  other  disaster  response  operations,  patients  must  be  transported via local community transportation assets to a patient staging area established at or near an  aerial  port  of  embarkation  (APOE)  suitable  for  handling  large  mobility  aircraft.  ERCC  teams  will  not  leave  the  vicinity  of  the  APOE  to  be  transported  to  area  medical treatment  facilities  or  long-term  care  facilities  to  receive  patients,  but  will  receive  their patients  from  the  staging  activity  at  the  APOE.        Consideration  must  be  given  to establishing a ground patient staging/holding capability able to provide care for critically ill and/or injured patients at the APOE until ERCC teams arrive to transport patients out of the area.  APOE critical care staging assets have pre-positioned critical care equipment and supplies – same as in the ERCC kit – to support critically ill and/or injured patients AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 25 awaiting transportation.   Patients are transported via mobility aircraft to pre-determined medical  treatment/care  facilities  located  near  established  aerial  port(s)  of  debarkation (APOD).    ERCC  teams  may  or  may  not  transport  patients  from  the  APOD  to  nearby MTFs.    Ideally,  transport  services  capable  of  providing  care  for  critically  ill  and/or injured patients should receive critically injured or ill patients at the APOD and transport the  patients  to  nearby  MTFs  without  degradation  in  the  level  of  care.    This  will  enable ERCC  teams  to  “quick-turn”  back  to  the  APOE  to  facilitate  the  swift  evacuation  of additional  patients.    Careful  attention  must  be  paid  to  the  proper  work/rest  cycle management of ERCC teams during disaster operations.  Team members must be rested and fully able to care for their patients.  ERCC teams must be provided proper rest during these operations (reference paragraph 4.8., this publication). 4.7.7.2.  Tricare  Beneficiary  Patient  Transports.    Prior  to  the  start  of  Operation  IRAQI FREEDOM, CCATTs routinely conducted beneficiary patient transport on AE missions within CONUS and OCONUS.  On occasion, ERCC teams may still be tasked to support a beneficiary patient transport mission.  This may occur more frequently in the European and  Pacific  theaters,  but  includes  CONUS  and  other  theaters  as  well.    When  an  ERCC team  is  required  for  a  beneficiary  patient  transport  mission,  the  patient’s  originating medical  treatment  facility  contacts  the respective PMRC.  The PMRC then contacts  the closest medical facility with ERCC capability to support the transport. 4.8.  ERCC Work/Rest Cycle (Team Endurance). 4.8.1.  General.  The work/rest cycle for ERCC teams does not equate to Aircrew Crew Duty Time and should not be used for mission planning purposes.  The guidelines herein are to be used to assess the ability of team members to continually provide optimal patient care for the duration of the mission, as well as to  ensure ERCC team members are given adequate time for rest/recovery prior to subsequent mission taskings or returning to point of origin. 4.8.2.  To ensure adequate time for rest/sleep cycles for ERCC teams, a rotational schedule is established  among  the  deployed  teams  at  a  particular  location.    The  ERCC  Director  at  the ERC  element  establishes  the  rotational  schedule  and  communicates  the  schedule  to  the AEOT  or  equivalent.    In  special  circumstances,  this  rotational  schedule  may  be  disrupted according to the flow of patients or when the ERCC Director (or designee, if not available) determines  that  it  is  medically  or  operationally  necessary  to  accomplish  the  mission successfully. 4.8.3.  Contingency (i.e. Wartime/DSCA/Humanitarian) Operations.  Under typical operating conditions,  the  standard  work  cycle  for  the  ERCC  teams  is  16  hours.    The  16-hour  work period begins with show time for mission preparation.  The work period ends when the team has delivered the patient(s) to the next level of care, the receiving facility has assumed care responsibilities for the patient, and all duties have been completed (to include replenishment of supplies/kits, pallet building when required, etc.).  For ERCC teams, a minimum rest and duty  policy  should  define  no  more  than  16  hours  of  duty  in  a  24-hour  time  frame  or scheduling  multiple  team  members  to  allocate  a  rotation  of  tending  the  patient  and  resting.  ERCC members must not consume alcoholic beverages within 12 hours of the beginning of the work period. 4.8.4.  Non-contingency Individual Beneficiary Transports.  When the ERCC team originates at  the  same  medical  treatment  facility  as  the  patient  being  transported,  the  16-hour  work 26 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 period begins four hours prior to scheduled take-off.  When the ERCC team is transported via aircraft to another facility (pre-positioned) to pick up a patient, the work period begins three hours  prior  to  scheduled  take-off  of  the  pre-positioning  leg.    ERCC  members  must  not consume alcoholic beverages within 12 hours of the beginning of the work period. 4.8.5.  Under  certain  circumstances,  such  as  delays  en  route  due  to  an  aircraft  maintenance issue, the ERCC team  chief may  extend the work period beyond 16 hours in  order to meet patient care requirements, to a maximum of 24 hours without outside coordination with the governing  C2  agency.    The  team  chief  should  consider  potential  benefits  (including minimizing remain overnight (RON) stops and continuity of patient care) and potential harm (due to delay or fatigue).  When extending the work period, the ERCC team chief notifies the MCD/Pilot-In-Command  who  will  notify  the  governing  C2  agency  (AECT,  618  AOC (TACC) or assigned AOC). 4.8.5.1.  Prior  to  the  work  period  and  throughout  a  mission,  the  ERCC  team  chief  is responsible  for  continual  assessment  of  the  team’s  health  and  mental  and  physical abilities to safely complete a mission and provide optimum critical care.  The ERCC team chief  should  also  consider  the  ability  of  the  entire  team  to  rest  when  not  engaged  in patient  care,  the  appropriateness  of  the  team  resting  in  shifts  while  engaged  in  patient care,  the  team’s  response  to  fatigue  countermeasures,  and  individual  team  member factors  affecting  operational  risk  management.    At  any  point,  if  the  team  is  assessed  as unsafe, the ERCC team chief notifies the MCD/PIC who will coordinate ERCC mission re-tasking  with  the  AEOT,  AECT  or  618  AOC  (TACC)  or  other  appropriate  C2  as applicable. 4.8.6.  There  may  be  times  (inclement  weather,  winds,  crew  duty  day,  etc.)  when  an  AE mission  must  RON  at  locations  where  local  medical  care  is  less  capable  than  the  care provided  by  the  ERCC  team.    The  ERCC  team  may  be  required  to  continue  caring  for  the patient, impacting work/rest cycles.  The local MTF commander (or equivalent), MCD, and ERCC  team  chief  should  collectively  determine  the  optimal  solution  to  satisfy  competing requirements.    In  instances  where  the  ERCC  team’s  work  period  is  projected  to  or  has exceeded the 16-hour period, the ERCC team chief has the authority to determine if any of the  ERCC  team  members  are  in  need  of  rest/sleep  and  authorize  rest/sleep  if  deemed necessary. 4.8.7.  It  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  AE  or  ERC  element  to  assist  the  ERCC  team  in returning to the duty location of the team (point of origin) as soon as the team has had time for  rest  and  replenishment/reconstitution  of  expended  supplies.    For  inter-theater  missions, the ERCC team should be allowed eight hours of uninterrupted sleep at the destination, prior to returning to their point of origin in the theater/area of operations.  When teams are allowed to  sleep  at  the  destination,  teams  will  be  more  capable  of  flying  again  once  they  return  to their duty location. 4.8.8.  Any ERCC team whose total work period has extended beyond 24 hours, inclusive of mission  support, positioning or de-positioning for a mission, and patient  care  activities will require  a  minimum  12  hours  of  uninterrupted  rest/sleep  prior  to  returning  to  their  primary duty location.  (T-1). 4.8.9.  Any  ERCC  team  that  can  be  returned  to  the  point-of-origin  duty  location  within  24 hours  from  show  time  of  the  originating  mission  may  be  returned  without  a  rest  period.  AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 27 When  this  occurs,  the  team  shall  have  a  minimum  10  hours  of  continuous  restful  activities including  an  opportunity  for  at  least  8  hours  of  uninterrupted  sleep  during  the  12  hours immediately  prior  to  a  mission  (rest  period  will  begin  after  release  from  return  to  point  of departure).  (T-1). 4.8.10.  In coordination with the Theater En Route Critical Care Director, if one is designated for the operation, the AECT/AOC may re-task an ERCC team  for patient  transport prior to returning the team to its home station, to support theater requirements.  When an ERCC team is re-tasked for patient transport immediately following completion of a previous mission, the total  duty  day,  inclusive  of  mission  support  and  patient  care  activities  should  not  extend beyond 24 hours.  If operational requirements prompt the re-tasking of an ERCC team in this manner, the ERCC team chief will assess whether the team is mentally and physically able to complete the mission.  If the team is assessed as unsafe, the team chief will notify the Theater ERCC  Director,  who,  in  turn,    notifies  the  AEOT  and  AECT  to  coordinate  tasking  for another ERCC team. 4.8.11.  ERCC Work/Rest Cycle policy may be waived by the Theater En Route Critical Care Director (or AECT if a Theater En Route Critical Care Director is not appointed) when there is an operational requirement for a team to be returned sooner to the AOR, or to be re-tasked for a patient transport mission. 4.8.12.  Alert ERCC Team.  For an ERCC team sitting alert and awaiting a mission tasking (i.e. TCCET awaiting critical care MEDEVAC tasking), every effort should be made not to exceed 24 hours of continuous alert without at least 16 hours of rest with 8 hours of protected sleep prior to the next alert cycle. 4.9.  Flight Operations. 4.9.1.  Assessment of Critical Care Patients – Permissive Environments.  Prior to a regulated mission, the PMRC validating flight surgeon works with the Theater ERCC Director, sending physician, accepting physician, clearing flight surgeon, and the transporting ERCC physician when  planning  and  coordinating  the  patient’s  transfer.    For  critically  ill  or  injured  patients, assessment  of  the  patient’s  clinical  status  for  flight  should  be  accomplished  by  the  ERCC team at the originating medical treatment facility whenever feasible.  Upon arrival at an MTF or staging location, the ERCC team:  assesses the patient’s clinical status for flight, performs required  interventions,  determines  continuing  in-flight  care  requirements,  and  recommends the  need  for  critical  care  augmentation  in  flight.      Patients  should  be  transitioned  to  ERCC equipment  and assessed  for stability in  an MTF  environment  when  geographically feasible.  Any  interventions  required  to  enhance  stability  for  transport  should  be  performed  prior  to transport.  The transporting ERCC physician makes the final determination whether or not a patient  will  be  transported  after  assessment,  considering  the  patient’s  ability  to  tolerate transport and operational considerations. 4.9.1.1.  For  regulated  evacuations,  if  the  patient  is  not  stable  enough  to  transport,  the ERCC  physician  consults  with  the  sending  physician  and  clearing  flight  surgeon  to consider withdrawing the PMR and removing the patient from the flight manifest. 4.9.1.2.  During  AE  missions,  the  transporting  ERCC  physician  will  consult  with  the theater  validating  flight  surgeon  from  the  location  of  patient  origin  if  the  number  of patients  or  the  acuity  of  patients  exceeds  the  capability  of  the  team.    Deviations  from 28 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 maximum ERCC patient loads will be at the discretion of the ERCC team physician and based on patient acuity, resources required/available, mission requirements, and any other factors  affecting  team  ability  to  provide  patient  care  without  degrading  capability.  Deviations  from  tasked  patient  loads  will  be  coordinated  with  the  TVFS  and communicated to the MCD prior to loading. 4.9.1.3.  Allowance  Standard  Utilization.    ERCC  teams  will  perform  missions  with complete equipment sets, regardless of the patient load, except on smaller, space-limited airframes.   ERCC teams may pare and tailor equipment  sets  for use on smaller, space-limited  airframes  according  to  patient  requirements.    When  considering  paring/tailoring equipment  for  missions  on  space-limited  airframes,  the  CCATT  team  chief,  in consultation  with  the  TVFS  and  the  mission  tasking  authority,  must  consider unanticipated  events  to  include  but  not  limited  to:  patient  requirements  due  to  possible changes in patient condition, the possibility of receiving additional, unanticipated patients at the pick-up point, the possibility for mission re-tasking prior to return to home-station, the possibility of diverting en route to pick up unexpected, additional patients, etc. 4.9.2.  Assessment of Critical Care Patients – Less Than Permissive Environments.   ERCC personnel,  especially  those  assigned  to  unregulated  ERCC  capabilities,  may  be  required  to evacuate patients from the point of injury or MTFs unable to provide required medical care for fresh or under-resuscitated casualties.  Operational factors may necessitate evacuation of patients that would normally be considered inadequately stabilized for patient movement.  In these cases, ERCC personnel attempt to stabilize the casualty prior to evacuation, if possible, and provide continued resuscitation en route to the nearest appropriate MTF. 4.9.2.1.  ERCC UTC’s tasked to support unregulated patient movement may augment or be  re-tasked  to  support  ERCC/AE  UTCs  in  situations  requiring  long  range  pre-hospital evacuation  of  fresh  casualties  such  as in  Anti-Access/Area  Denial  (A2/AD) environments. 4.9.3.  ERCC Patient  Assessment  – Unregulated  Patients.  Due to  the nature of unregulated patient  movement,  it  is  expected  that  pre-mission  medical  planning  will  be  significantly abbreviated.    When  operational  constraints  allow,  ERCC  personnel  are  expected  to  assess patient at the bedside and initiate ERCC movement from that point.  As POI and some Role 1/2  evacuations  may  require  ERCC  to  receive  patients  at  a  trans-load  location  or  from  a casualty  collection  point  site,  ERCC  teams  may  be  expected  to  perform  their  initial assessment during evacuation. 4.9.4.  AE  Mission  Responsibilities.  The  AE  crew  ensures  all  power  and  oxygen requirements  are  met  and  properly  configured  for  ERCC  patient  requirements.    The  ERCC physician  is  responsible  for  all  clinical  decisions  regarding  critically  ill  patients  under  their care during patient movement, including notifying the MCD of any changes in patient status requiring collaboration through the AOC with the PMRC and validating flight surgeon.  The MCD incorporates the ERCC team’s capabilities into pre-mission planning and briefings for patient emergencies, as appropriate 4.9.5.  ERCC  physician  on-board  may  be  consulted  at  any  time  during  a  mission  by  the MCD/FN  to  evaluate  an  AE  patient  who  has  exhibited  a  change  in  condition.    If  deemed necessary  by  the  ERCC  physician,  primary  responsibility  for  the  care  of  the  patient  is transferred to the ERCC team and further care will be documented on the AF Form 3899L, AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 29 Patient  Movement  Record  En  Route  Critical  Care.    Participation  of  the  physician  with/for any AE patient’s care is documented on the AE patient medical record and a DD Form 2852. 4.9.6.  During  ground  transportation  at  the  completion  of  the  mission,  the  patient  is transferred to the receiving expeditionary medical platform/MTF via means with appropriate critical care capability. 4.10.  Ground Operations  . 4.10.1.  Mission Support.  ERCC teams should be included in duties related to expeditionary squadron/element  deployment,  employment  (including  camp  set-up),  and  re-deployment activities while maximizing operational  mission  readiness and appropriate work/rest  cycles.  Launch and recovery operations and standard aircraft configuration are the responsibility of AECMs  or  other  service  branch  crewmembers  or  ground  support  personnel.    ERCC  teams may  assist  trained,  experienced  personnel  in  aircraft  configuration  duties  and  other  ground operations when authorized by the CCATT Director (when appointed), when not on primary call and are governed by the work/rest rules.  Before assisting, ERCC personnel must be fully oriented and trained in  the performance of ground mission support duties and may perform these  duties  only  under  the  supervision  of,  and  in  conjunction  with,  experienced  ground support  personnel.    Under  no  circumstances  will  ERCC  personnel  be  required  to  perform launch  and  recovery  of  aircraft,  aircraft  configuration,  and  other  ground  support  activities without proper orientation/training and without experienced ground support personnel. 4.10.1.1.  AE or ERC units should regard the ERCC teams as expert critical care medical consultants,  available  to  provide  advice  whenever  questions  arise  about  care  of  patients during  transport.    ERCC  teams  may  provide  clinical  in-service  training  sessions  to assigned AE or ERC element personnel, if requested, as operations allow. 4.10.2.  Local  MTF  Assistance  during  Deployed  Operations.    Critical  care  skills  deteriorate quickly  and  must  be  practiced  continuously  in  order  to  maintain  the  highest  expertise  and proficiency  level.    AE  or  ERC  element  commanders  shall  encourage  assigned  ERCC members  to  seek  opportunities  to  assist  personnel  at  a  local  MTF  with  the  care  of  critical patients  in  order  to  maintain  clinical  currency  and  proficiency.    ERCC  personnel  may supplement local MTF staff only when practical and not on alert.  This practice has the added benefit  of  providing  the  ERCC  team  with  prior  knowledge  of  the  status  and  care requirements for patients they may be tasked to transport.  For UTC FFCCT team assigned, the  CCATT  Director  coordinates  assigned  FFCCT  teams  to  assist  in  a  local  MTF  after approval  from  the  AE  or  ERC  element  commander.    The  CCATT  Director  is  the  primary liaison  between  AE  or  ERC  C2  and  other  ground  patient  care  facilities  and  determines involvement  of  ERCC  personnel  in  local  MTF  assistance.    ERCC  personnel  must  not  be scheduled  for  regular  duty  hours  in  a  MTF  due  to  the  nature  of  the  ever-changing  flying environment – assistance in a local MTF must not interrupt work/rest cycle or mission-ready status. 4.10.3.  ERCC teams can assist in the support of non-ERCC patient reception and triage at an ERC  staging  location  or  other  ERC  patient  interface  point  as  befitting  the  team’s  clinical skills.  The ERCC Director should ensure this support does not interfere with their primary assigned duties, work/rest rule, and their mission-ready status. 30 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 4.11.  Documentation.  AF  Form  3899L,  Patient  Movement  Record  En  Route  Critical  Care  is prescribed for use during transport of critically ill or injured patients.  The form is used to direct and  record  care.    A  copy  of  the  form  accompanies  each  patient  to  ensure  appropriate  care  is documented during transport and serves as the record of patient care while in the AE system.  If additional AF Form 3899 attachments (e.g. A-K) are required, they should be used in addition to, not  in  place  of,  the  AF  3899L.    Examples  include  progress  notes  that  require  additional  space, additional  medication  sheets,  detailed  Input-Output  recording,  restraint  use,  or  patient resuscitation.   If available, copies of patient medical documentation including operative reports should be provided to the ERCC team chief.  ERCC teams are required to participate in the AE Patient  Safety  Program,  (reference  AFI  48-307,  Volume  1,  Aeromedical  Evacuation  Medical Operations).  (T-2). 4.12.  CCATT  Quality  Improvement/Performance  Improvement  (QI/PI)  Program.  The CCATT QI/PI Program is a patient safety program and peer review activity under AFI 44-119, Medical  Quality  Operations,  and  10  U.S.C.  Section  1102,  Confidentiality  of  Medical  Quality Assurance Records: Qualified Immunity for Participants.  AMC/SG has designated the CCATT Pilot  Unit  at  the  59th  Medical  Wing  (MDW)  as  the  central  manager  for  the  CCATT  QI/PI Program.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  CCATT  Pilot  Unit  to  obtain  all  CCATT  mission documentation  and  maintain  a  performance  improvement  platform  to  ensure  safe  patient transport.    The  goal  of  the  program  is  to  identify  and  correct  patient  care  issues  directly impacting  patient  outcome  throughout  the  continuum  of  care.    Identification  of  potential problems  occurs  through  two  primary  channels:  1)  CCATT  QI/PI  manager  participates  in  the weekly  clinical  theater  video  teleconference  identifying  potential  areas  for  improvement;  2)  all pages  of  the  completed  AF  3899s  are  sent  to  the  59th  Medical  Wing  for  each  ERCC  patient transported.  After reviewing the documentation, the CCATT QI/PI manager enters data into the CCATT registry.  When an item for potential improvement is identified, a PI event is opened in the registry.  At the completion of the investigation, the item is closed by the CCATT Pilot Unit Medical  Director and  feedback is  provided to the involved CCATT team.  When a  global area for improvement is identified, the information is forwarded to AMC/SGK, and the cadres of the CCAT Initial and Advanced Course for potential inclusion in the curriculum. 4.12.1.  The  CCATT  Pilot  Unit  is  the  central  collection  point  for  all  CCATT  medical documentation.  It is the responsibility of each CCATT to forward medical documentation to the CCATT Pilot Unit on each patient transported during all operations and missions whether “peacetime”  beneficiary  movements,  contingency,  or  disaster  relief  operations.    When  the CCATT arrives at  the destination medical  treatment facility,  after  giving a patient  report to the receiving facility, the team copies/scans the AF 3899L and supporting documentation, for each of their patients.  The team must then forward the copy of the medical documentation to the  Pilot  Unit  via  Fax  (DSN  554-5053  or  CML  210-292-5053)  or  scan  and  e-mail  the documentation to:  ccattpilotunit.59mdw@us.af.mil.   (T-2).    Appropriate Health  Insurance Portability  and  Accountability  Act  of  1996  (HIPAA)  security  statements  must  be  included.  Faxes are  received in  a locked office with  no through-access.   The  records are entered into the  theater  medical  information  system,  and  the  QI/PI  Manager  uploads  the  documentation into the Joint Theater Trauma Registry (JTTR) for analysis, research, and tracking of trends. 4.12.1.1.  If an ARC CCATT is involved and a global issue for improvement is identified, AMC/SG will forward the feedback/information to ANG and AFRC Surgeons’ offices. AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 31 4.13.  Security.  Medical personnel and equipment are non-combatant assets.  Personnel may be armed  as  dictated  by  theater  instructions.    Security  for  ERCC  personnel  and  equipment  is  the responsibility of the host unit.  All ERCC team members are issued and qualified on the assigned weapon  for  their  UTC/position,  (reference  AFI  10-401,  Air  Force  Operations  Planning  and Execution  and  AFI  41-106,  Medical  Readiness  Program  Management).    Note:    Enlisted personnel on UTC FFCCT do not carry the M-16; they will be issued the M-9. 32 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 Chapter 5 OPERATIONAL SUPPORT FLYING 5.1.  Operational  Support  Flier  (OSF).  Personnel  assigned  to  ERCC  UTCs  are  operational support fliers.  ERCC team members are not considered, nor do they qualify to obtain, rated or non-rated aircrew status – aircrew rules/instructions do not apply to OSF personnel.  (Exception:  Active flight surgeons holding an aircrew position indicator (API) 5 position performing duties as ERCC retain crewmember status.  Ref:  AFI 11-401.)  Members of ERCC UTCs fly in OSF (non-crewmember)  status  and  must  comply  with  AFI  11-401,  Aviation  Management,  and  AFI 11-402,  Aviation  and  Parachutist  Service,  Aeronautical  Ratings  and  Badges.    Members  of ERCC  UTCs  must  be  medically  qualified  according  to  AFI  48-123,  Medical  Examination  and Standards,  and  have  completed  appropriate  physiological  training  (reference  AFI  11-403, Aerospace  Physiological  Training  Program),  to  participate  in  flying  activities.        Once  these qualifications have been met, an ERCC UTC member may be placed on OSF status.  Personnel may  not  be  employed  or  deployed  as  a  member  of  an  ERCC  UTC  until  they  meet  all requirements  for  OSF  status.    As  OSF,  ERCC  members  may  be  eligible  for  hazardous  duty incentive pay (HDIP). 5.1.1.  Original  Training.    First-time  Original  Training  typically  occurs  while  attending  the CCAT Initial Course.  All ERCC UTC members must have a current and cleared DD Form 2992,  Medical  Recommendation  for  Flying  or  Special  Operational  Duty,  in  order  to participate in and receive initial physiological (altitude chamber) training during the course.  Recurrent physiological training must be accomplished as required (reference AFI 11-403). 5.1.2.  Host  Aviation  Resource  Management  (HARM)  Office  and  Flight  Record.    Upon successfully  completing  the  CCAT  Initial  Course  and  meeting  the  qualifications  for  OSF status,  ERCC  UTC  members  report  to  their  home-station  HARM  or  Squadron  Aviation Resource Management  (SARM) office with  a  copy of their  certificate  for the CCAT  Initial Course,  a  copy  of  their  current  DD  Form  2992  and  their  AF  Form  1274,  Physiological Training (previously, AF Form 702, Physiological Training Record – AF Form 702 has been eliminated).  The HARM office will establish a flight record folder for the member.   (T-1).  Upon completing the CCAT Advanced Course, members bring a current copy of the course certificate to the HARM office to be added to the flight record folder. 5.2.  Flight  Operations  Protective  Clothing  and  Equipment.  ERCC  UTC  members  will  be properly  equipped  to  perform  duties  in  the  flying  environment  to  include  issue  of  aircrew-specific  personal  protective  clothing  items.    ERCC  team  members  will  have  the  same  flight personal protective clothing, equipment, and IPE as the organic crews for the particular airframe or mission which ERCC UTC personnel are assigned/tasked.  Each ERCC UTC member will be provided the required protective clothing and equipment for flight operations to perform patient transport  missions  according  to  threat,  mission  and  environmental  conditions.    (T-1).    It  is  the responsibility of the home station unit commander to ensure members assigned to the MTF and identified to fill ERCC position requirements are properly equipped for flight operations. 5.2.1.  A  list  of  initial-issue  minimum-required  protective  clothing/equipment  items  for ERCC  flight  operations  is  shown  in  Attachment  3.    Commanders  may  approve  these  items for  issue  as  organizational  clothing  and  cite  Attachment  3  in  their  required  written AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 33 justification for the expenditure (reference AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, paragraph  10.58).    Charge  the  cost  of  the  distinctive  uniforms,  functional  clothing  and authorized  alterations  to  the  unit  of  assignment's  O&M-type  funds.    If  the  member  is assigned to the MTF, Defense Health Program (DHP) O&M may be used for their purchase. 5.2.2.  A  list  of  minimum-required  protective  clothing/equipment  items  for  ERCC  flight operations in support of combat/hostile actions is shown in Attachment 4.  Items required for deployment or contingency operations cannot be funded from MTF DHP O&M funds.  Per AFI 65-601V1, Section 10C, paragraph 10.26, “Any expenses attributed to the contingency pre-deployment,  employment,  and  redeployment  of  medical  combat  support  personnel, equipment,  and  supplies  requested  by  the  combatant  commander  and  approved  by  proper authority, as well as medical BW/CW items supporting deploying personnel, will be paid by Line (3400) funds. Bases should establish a line Project Funds Management Record (PFMR) and RC/CC for the MTF to use to record these expenses.”   During 5.2.3.  Individual  Body  Armor  (IBA)  vs.  Aircrew  Body  Armor  (ABA). combat/hostile action support operations, ERCC teams must deploy with National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Level IV Ballistic Individual Body Armor.  Aircrew Flight Equipment does not provide ABA to ERCC teams.  Unlike the front-end and AE aircrew members, ERCC teams leave  the  aircraft  and  flight  line  area  to  retrieve  patients,  potentially  directly  exposing themselves  to  hostile  elements,  thus  requiring  a  higher  level  of  personal  protection.    If ballistic IBA is not provided by the supported CCDR prior to or upon entry into the theater, ERCC  team  must  acquire  IBA  beforehand.    IBA  for  contingency  requirements  is  paid  by Line  (3400)  funds  (reference  AFI  65-601v1).    NIJ  Level-IV  ballistic  IBA  should  not  be confused  with  flak  vest/fragmentation  vest  –  flak/fragmentation  vests  do  not  provide  the required  level  of  protection.    Additional  information  on  body  armor  requirements  may  be found in Attachment 4. 5.3.  Aeronautical Orders (AOs).  As operational support fliers, members of ERCC UTCs must be  on  appropriate  AOs  when  on-board  rotary  or  fixed-wing  aircraft  for  training  or  real-world missions.    (T-2).    AOs  authorize  personnel  to  perform  flights  on-board  aircraft  and  allow  the team members to be listed on the Flight Authorization and perform duties on-board the aircraft. 5.3.1.  In order to qualify for AOs to support patient transport missions, members must: 5.3.1.1.  Have completed the CCAT Initial Course; one-time attendance (copy of training certificate to be kept in member’s flight record folder). 5.3.1.2.  Have a current OSF physical with DD Form 2992; annual requirement. 5.3.1.3.  Have a current AF Form 1274; after original training, flying personnel complete refresher training once every five years. 5.3.1.4.  Have  completed,  and  maintain  currency  in,  the  CCAT  Advanced  Course; required every two years (copy of the current training certificate to be kept in member’s flight record folder. 5.3.2.  AOs  are  requested  in  writing  with  a  letter  signed  by  the  ERCC  team’s  home-station unit  commander  (reference  AFI  11-402).    If  member  will  perform  OSF  duties  for  multiple months,  request  the  HARM  office  publish  multiple  AOs  in  advance  sufficient  to  cover  the duration  of  the  deployment.    Requests  should  be  presented  to  the  HARM  office  well  in 34 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 advance  of  the  date  AOs  are  required  in  order  to  allow  for  proper  processing.    When requested  in  advance,  the  HARM  office  can  ensure  the  AOs  are  prepared  in  time  to accompany the member to the deployed location.  It is the responsibility of the home-station to ensure ERCC teams deploy with AOs. 5.3.2.1.  NOTE  :    Air  Reserve  Component  (ARC)  ERCC  UTC  members  must  be  on mobilization orders, extended man-day (MPA) orders, or extended active duty in order to be  on  AOs  in  support  of  flying  real-world  patient  transport  missions.    (T-1).    ARC members  participating  in  flying  activities  while  in  UTA  status,  Annual  Tour,  or  any status/condition  other  than  previously  stated  are  not  eligible  for  regular  AOs,  may  not record flight time, or receive incentive pay. 5.3.3.  Non-interference  AOs  for  Training/Exercises.  Active  Component  (AC)  and  ARC ERCC teams participating in training flights where they will set up and train on their medical equipment  kits  must  be on  non-interference  AOs  for  the  duration  of  the  training  activity  in order  to  participate  in  the  training  flight(s)  (reference  AFI  11-401,  Aviation  Management).  (T-2).    This  applies  to  training  flight  activities  conducted  during  the  CCAT  Advanced Course,  Joint  Readiness  Training  Center  (JRTC),  Theater  Aeromedical  Evacuation  System (TAES) exercises, local training flights, or similar training flight activities.  Non-interference AOs will allow the ERCC teams to be listed on the Flight Authorization and permits them to set  up  their  medical  equipment  and  perform  training  during  the  flight.    If  an  ERCC  team member  reports  to  a  training  flight  activity  without  non-interference  AOs,  they  will  not  be able  to  participate  in  the  training  activities  during  flight.    ERCC  teams  may  fly  on familiarization flights without AOs if approved as per AFI 11-401, but are not listed on the Flight Authorization, nor may they set up equipment and conduct training during the flight.  ERCC teams must meet and maintain the qualifications for OSF status in order to be on non-interference AOs – completed CCAT Initial Course, and have current DD Form 2992 and AF Form 702/1274 (completion/currency in the CCAT Advanced Course is not required for non-interference AOs).  (T-1).  When on non-interference AOs, members will not log time nor be eligible for HDIP; completion of AFTO 781 is not required. 5.3.3.1.  The  process  for  requesting  non-interference  AOs  mirrors  the  process  for requesting regular AOs for normal ERCC missions; non-interference AOs are requested in  writing  with  a  letter  signed  by  the  ERCC  team’s  home  station  unit  commander.  (NOTE: Check respective MAJCOM supplements for additional guidance on requesting non-interference AOs, as applicable.)  The letter must clearly state the request is for non-interference  AOs.    The  AOs  should  be  requested  to  cover  the  duration  of  the  course, exercise,  or  other  particular  training  activity.    When  flying  with  non-interference  AOs, OSF personnel do not log time and are not eligible for incentive pay. 5.3.3.1.1.  Air Reserve Component members may obtain non-interference AOs while in any military duty status in order to participate in training or exercise flights. 5.3.3.2.  AF Form 1887,  Aeronautical Order (PA) Aviation Service.  OSF AOs are only valid for a calendar month at time and expire the last day of each month, unless an earlier termination  date  is  known.    New  AOs  are  published  monthly  for  those  members  who need to be on AOs for extended periods.  When ERCC members require AOs for periods greater than one month, the HARM office prepares the AOs on AF Form 1887 and gives AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 35 the  deploying  ERCC  members  sufficient  AOs  required  for  the  duration  of  their deployment. 5.3.3.2.1.  EXCEPTION:  The CCAT-OSF Program is funded on a fiscal year basis.  When  a  member’s  deployment  stretches  from  one  fiscal  year  into  the  next,  the HARM office supplies AOs effective through the last day of the fiscal year.  As the central  manager  for  the  CCAT-OSF  Program,  AMC/SGK  requests  program allocations  each  fiscal  year  through  AMC/A3  NLT  15  June.    AMC/A3 consolidates man-month  requirements  into  two  categories,  officer  and  enlisted,  and  sends  the request  to  AF/A3XM  NLT  15  July.    In  turn,  AMC/SGK  provides  new  fiscal  year program  allocations  to  each  HARM  office  supporting  ERCC  teams.    Excess allocations from the prior fiscal year may not be carried into the following fiscal year; HARM  offices  will  turn  in  excess/unused  CCAT-OSF  program  allocations  to AMC/SGK  and  that  office  will  turn  in  the  excess/unused  allocations  to  AMC/A3  at the end of each fiscal year. 5.3.3.3.  AFTO  Form  781,  ARMS  Aircrew/Mission  Flight  Data  Document.    As  OSF, ERCC members are authorized to log flight time on AFTO Form 781.  AFTO Form 781 is the source document for recording and reporting operational flight information for each individual authorized to take part in a mission.  This form is the primary record of both personnel and aerospace vehicle flying hours.  It is also the official record to validate pay eligibility for qualified members required to fly. 5.3.3.3.1.  Logging  Flight  Time.    In  order  to  qualify  for  HDIP  for  any  particular month, ERCC members log a minimum of four hours of “Primary” flight time within that month, or the appropriate fractional  time required to  qualify  for partial  HDIP if member is on orders for less than 30/31 days (DoD 7000.14R, Financial Management Regulations (FMRs), Volume 7A, Military Pay Policy and Procedures – Active Duty and  Reserve  Pay).        Only  “Primary”  time  logged  counts  toward  credit  for  HDIP; ERCC  teams  only  log  “Primary”  time  when  actually  performing  patient  care  duties on-board the aircraft.  ERCC members may not “bank” flying time or carry time over from  one  month  to  another  in  order  to  meet  the  minimum  required  to  qualify  for HDIP.  En-route missions to pick up patients requiring medical care will be logged as “Other”  time  when  patients  are  not  on  board  the  aircraft  (Ref:  AFI  11-402).    (For example: An ERCC team is tasked to fly to pick up a patient downrange.  On the en-route mission to pick up the patient, the ERCC team logs “Other” time.  Primary time will then be logged on the leg when the patient is on board the aircraft and the ERCC team  provides  medical  assistance  in-flight.)    Complete  AFTO  Form  781  (reference AFI 11-401).  Member(s) will list duties performed on the back of AFTO Form 781 in  the  remarks  section.    The  completed  AFTO  Form  781  must  be  submitted  to  the supporting  SARM  member  at  the  deployed  location  or  to  the  ERCC  team’s  home station HARM office in  a timely manner, preferably at the end of each mission, but not later than the fifth day of the month following the month in which a mission was flown.      AFTO  Form  781’s  not  turned  in  on  time,  may  result  in  a  member  not receiving  flight  time  credit  or  HDIP  for  the  month  during  which  the  corresponding mission was flown.  Under no circumstances are AFTO Form 781’s to be held until the end of an extended deployment before being turned in to the HARM office.  On 36 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 AE  missions,  ERCC  teams  may  coordinate  with  the  MCD  to  ensure  proper documentation on the AFTO Form 781. 5.3.3.3.1.1.  Logging  Flight  Time  on  Non-AE  Missions  on  Other  Than  USAF Aircraft.  When transporting patients on non-AE missions on non-USAF aircraft, ERCC  team  members  carry  their  own  AFTO  Form  781.    After  the  mission, complete  the  AFTO  Form  781  and  turn  it  in  to  the  supporting  SARM  at  the deployed  location  or  to  the  ERCC  team  member’s  home  station  HARM, whichever  is  appropriate.      The  Remarks  section  of  the  form  should  include  a statement  such  as,  “TCCET  transported  “#”  patient(s)  via  US  Army  UH-60;  I certify  this  is  a  true  and  verifiable  statement.”[Signed];  or  similar  wording  as appropriate. 5.3.3.3.1.2.  Partial  Team.    On  occasion,  a  patient  may  not  require  a  full  ERCC team complement, or there may be other operational constraints where less than a complete ERCC team complement may be tasked to transport a patient.  It is not necessary  for  the  whole  team  to  be  tasked  for  the  mission  to  be  considered  an ERCC  mission.    Individuals  flying  without  the  full  team  complement  fly  with active aeronautical orders, log time and may qualify for HDIP. 5.3.3.3.2.  Signature  on  AFTO  Form  781.    The  aircraft  commander,  senior  OSF member  of  the  team,  and  MCD  (when  on  AE  missions)  ensure  OSF  personnel  fly only  on  missions  that  require  performance  of  valid  in-flight  duties  and  confirm Primary flying time is logged only during portions of the mission when valid in-flight duties  are  performed.    Aircraft  commanders  or  senior  OSF  member  ensure  actual duties performed are documented in the remarks section of the AFTO Form 781, and certify by signing under the remark (reference AFI 11-402).  ERCC members should include their home station HARM/SARM base, DSN phone number, and fax number, if known, in the remarks section on the back of the (original and extract) AFTO Form 781.    NOTE:    AOs  alone  do  not  authorize  a  member  to  fly  and  log  time  for entitlement to incentive pay.  Time spent in observation, familiarization, or point-to-point travel (except for pre-positioning legs) is not logged on the AFTO Form 781. 5.4.  Aviation  Service  Code  (ASC)/Flying  Activity  Code  (FAC).    The  assigned  ASC  for ERCC members performing duties as operational support fliers is "ASC 9C."  The flying activity code for ERCC teams on OSF is "FZ" per AFI 11-401, Aviation Management. 5.4.1.  Active Flight Surgeon on ERCC UTC (Ref: AFI 11-401).  Active Flight Surgeons in an API 5 position may be employed as ERCC UTC members provided they also hold one of the  qualifying  AFSCs  required  for  ERCC  duty  as  outlined  in  the  UTC  MISCAP  statement and  Manpower  Force  (MANFOR)  packaging  document.    Active  flight  surgeons  log  "FS" crew position and primary-time duty credit, record "ASC 8A”, and may qualify for aviation career incentive pay (ACIP). 5.4.2.  Inactive Flight Surgeon on ERCC (Ref:  AFI 11-401).  Inactive flight surgeons – those in  an  API  0  position  – may  also  be  employed  as  ERCC  UTC  members  provided  they  hold one  of  the  qualifying  AFSCs  as  outlined  in  the  UTC  MISCAP.    Because  they  are  rated officers, their ASC remains "8J" (based on no API 5/no ACIP authorized), their AOs reflect a "FAC  8"  (rated  officer  performing  non-crew  duty),  and  they  log  flight  authorization  duty code  "FZ"  time  on  ERCC  missions  (reference  AFI  11-401).    Following  this  guidance, AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 37 inactive  flight  surgeons  employed  on  ERCC  UTCs  are  authorized  HDIP,  if  otherwise qualified. 5.5.  Flight  Authorization.  The  unit  providing  the  AE  or  ERC  crew  originating  with  a  live mission or an ERCC training mission is responsible for adding the ERCC team members on the flight  to  the  manifest  of  the  aircrew  flight  authorization  after  validating  members  have  current aeronautical  orders.      For  an  ERCC  team  joining  the  mission  en  route,  the  MCD  or  equivalent validates  members  have  current  aeronautical  orders,  ensures  the  members’  names  are handwritten  onto  the  flight  authorization  and  ensures  flight  time  is  logged  (reference  AFI  11-401). 38 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 Chapter 6 TRAINING 6.1.  Introduction.  Initial, advanced, and recurrent training are required in order to maintain the operational and clinical proficiency of ERCC UTC-assigned personnel.  All ERCC UTCs share CCAT Initial and CCAT Advanced Courses as the foundation-level qualifying courses.  ERCC UTC members will not be employed or deployed in an ERCC UTC capacity unless they meet all initial and recurrent training requirements. 6.2.  Unit  ERCC  Coordinator.  An  ERCC  Team  Coordinator  should  be  established  at  each home-station  medical  unit  with  an  ERCC  UTC  assigned.    This  person  should  be  appointed  in writing  by  the  medical  unit  commander.    Examples  of  the  unit  ERCC  coordinator’s responsibilities  are  as  follows:    (1)  central  point  of  contact  within  the  unit  for  all  matters pertaining to ERCC teams’ interface with the unit, parent MAJCOM, Pilot Unit, MEFPAK and higher headquarters for ERCC issues; (2) establishing and maintaining training folders for each ERCC UTC member assigned and ensuring that all requirements are appropriately listed/tracked in  the  Medical  Readiness  Decision  Support  System  (MRDSS);  (3)  ensuring  all  initial  and sustainment  training  requirements  are  scheduled  to  be  met/current;  (4)  initiating  all  required forms  and  documentation  for  all  new  ERCC  UTC  members;  (5)  ensuring  ERCC  teams  are properly  equipped  for  patient  movement  missions;  (6)  identifying  and  scheduling  personnel  to meet  initial  training  and  sustainment  training  requirements  in  coordination  with  the  training office  and  the  medical  readiness  office;  (7)  coordinating  with  the  medical  readiness  office  to ensure  members  are  ready  to  deploy;    (8)  other  responsibilities  that  may  be  assigned  and necessary for unit-level ERCC administration.  When an ERCC coordinator is appointed, notify AMC/SGK and AMC/SGX of the member’s name and contact information to ensure appropriate distribution  of  information;  e-mail:    amc.sgk@us.af.mil  .    (Key  information  distributed  by AMC/SGK  and  SGX  offices  should  include  owning  MAJCOM  SGX  offices  for  situational awareness.)    Note:    This  does  not  apply  to  ERC  units  when  ERCC  teams  are  temporarily assigned/attached.  During deployments, when ERCC teams are assigned to an ERC element, a director is designated for local management of ERCC teams. into  ERCC  Training.  Personnel  are 6.3.  Entry for nomination/appointment  to  an  ERCC  UTC.    Validation  of  critical  care  skills  for  eligibility  for assignment  to  an  ERCC  UTC  will  be  performed  by  the  Clinical  Validation  Committee administered by AFEMSI, under the authority/direction of AMC/SG (reference  Chapter 3, this document). level selected  at the  unit 6.4.  Training  (see Attachment 5, Table A6.1). 6.4.1.  Training Pipeline. Training attendance priority should be given to those tasked in the AEF Tempo Band Construct to meet deployment requirements. 6.4.1.1.  CCAT  Initial  Course.    All  ERCC  UTC  personnel  (Active  Component,  AFRC, and ANG) complete the CCAT Initial Course IAW AFI 41-106. 6.4.1.2.  CCAT  Advanced  Course.    All  ERCC  UTC  personnel  (Active  Component, AFRC,  and  ANG)  complete the  CCAT  Advanced  Course  IAW  AFI  41-106.  (EXCEPTION: UTC FFTCT – see paragraph 6.4.2 below) AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 39 6.4.1.2.1.  ERCC UTC members who are identified for deployment during the year in which  they  complete  the  CCAT  Initial  Course  also  complete  the  CCAT  Advanced Course prior to deployment. 6.4.1.2.2.  Every effort should be made to schedule all ERCC personnel to attend this UTC training in advance of their potential AEF Block assignment to ensure they are successful in course completion.  Do not wait to schedule this course.  Attendees who do  not  successfully  complete  the  CCAT  Advanced  Course  require  remediation  and re-attendance  at  the  CCAT  Advanced  Course  prior  to  deployment  as  an  ERCC member.    The  remediation  training  plan  will  be  issued  to  the  individual  and  his/her commander by the course director, through AFEMSI. 6.4.1.2.3.  The  course  curriculum  culminates  in  a  field  exercise  involving  static training  and  a  flying  training  mission.    ERCC  members  attending  the  CCAT Advanced  Course  must  be  current  in  OSF  requirements  and  have  non-interference aeronautical  orders  on-hand  to  participate  in  flying  training  activities  during  the course. 6.4.2.  TCCET Course.   All  UTC FFTCT members will complete the TCCE Course.  UTC FFTCT members complete CCAT Initial and CCAT Advanced Courses prior to attending the TCCET  Course.    In  lieu  of  completing  the  CCAT  Advanced  Course  for  triennial  re-validation  of  clinical  skills,  UTC  FFTCT  members  complete  the  TCCET  Course  every  36 months. 6.4.2.1.  Rotary  Wing  Operations  Orientation.    All  UTC  FFTCT  members  complete  a MRA-approved  rotary  wing  operations  orientation  course  as  well  as  underwater  egress training.  These courses may be scheduled at any time during the training pipeline  – the CCAT  Initial  Course,  the  CCAT  Advanced  Course,  or  the  TCCET  Course  are  not prerequisites to completing this requirement. 6.4.3.  ERCC Flight Training.  The primary objective of ERCC flight training is to develop and  maintain  the  skills  necessary  for  the  effective  employment  of  ERCC  teams  within  the flight  environment  during  all  manner  of  contingencies  and  missions.    The  secondary objective  is  to  ensure  the  successful  integration  of  ERCC  teams  into  ERC  operations, primarily working alongside AECMs/organic crewmembers to transport patients.  Initial and subsequent flight training requirements for ERCC teams will normally be met through formal course  attendance.    All  ERCC  teams  are  encouraged  to  seek  additional  flight  training opportunities through participation in activities such as exercises or local unit training. 6.4.3.1.  An  AE  crew  must  be  on-board  the  aircraft  during  flight  training  activities involving UTC FFCCT teams (except on rotary wing aircraft).  (T-1).  ERCC teams must be on non-interference aeronautical  orders to  participate in  any flight  training activities.  Reference  Chapter  5, this  publication,  for  non-interference  aeronautical  order requirements/guidance. 6.4.3.1.1.  ERCC Training Mission (ETM).  ERCC flight training missions should be structured to achieve maximum training effectiveness.  ETM sessions should include at  least  one  enplaning  or  deplaning  event  with  occupied  or  weighted  litter(s); transport, loading, exercising of the complete assigned UTC equipment kit to include set-up  of  medical  equipment  and  appropriate  patient  treatment/transport  scenario(s).  40 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 Sessions  should  also  include  one  aircraft  emergency  scenario  under  the  direction  of the MCD/Medical Crew Coordinator (MCC) or organic crewmember equivalent. 6.4.4.  Operational  Support  Flier  Training.    All  ERCC  UTC  personnel  must  complete  the requirements for OSF status (reference AFI 11-402).  ERCC UTC personnel must maintain currency in OSF requirements as long as they are assigned to an ERCC UTC.  Personnel may not  be  employed  or  deployed  as  ERCC  members  if  they  have  not  completed  or  are  not current  in  OSF  requirements.    ERCC  UTC  members  must  be  on  OSF  AOs  in  order  to participate in flight activities on-board U.S. and coalition aircraft. 6.4.5.  Operational  Exercises.    Some  sustainment  training  and  RSVs  may  be  completed during  operational  exercises.    To  receive  credit,  exercises  have  a  written  training  plan outlining day-to-day objectives for the ERCC teams.  Training plan must follow ERCC UTC METL.    ERCC  teams  participating  in  exercises/evaluations  must  participate  with  their associated  equipment  UTC.    The  ERCC  teams  perform  relevant  tasks  associated  with  the ERCC  UTC  METL,  e.g.,  mission  planning,  patient  preparation,  setting  up  and  exercising their medical equipment, transport and treatment of simulated casualties or mannequins, etc.  ERCC  UTC  members  participating  in  exercises  must  be  current  in  OSF  requirements  and have  non-interference  aeronautical  orders  on-hand  to  participate  in  training  missions involving flying activities during the exercise. 6.4.5.1.  ERCC  Team  Observer  Controller/Standards  Evaluator.    A  qualified  ERCC Observer  Controller  (OC)/Standards  Evaluator  (SE)  should  be  present  for  exercises (qualified ERCC Team OC/SE is defined as any ERCC UTC member who has completed the  CCAT  Initial  and  Advanced  Courses,  and  is  current  in  all  required  training; JRTC/deployment/mission  experience  is  preferred  but  not  required).    Standards  and responsibilities of ERCC OC/SE are outlined in the ERCC Observer Controller/Standards Evaluator Pamphlet available from AMC/SGK.  Requesting unit pays travel and expenses for individual(s) to participate in exercise as OC/SE.  Availability of personnel to support OC/SE requests shall be at the discretion of the supporting unit.  If OC/SE personnel are utilized, there should be at least one OC/SE per two ERCC teams, availability permitting.  The exercise organizer(s) should develop a written training plan with relevant objectives for the ERCC team(s), following the ERCC UTC METLs.  A reasonable effort should be made to secure qualified ERCC OC/SE personnel for the exercise(s). 6.4.6.  Readiness  Training.    IAW  AFI  41-106,  all  personnel  are  required  to  complete  all readiness training. 6.4.7.  High  Risk  of  Isolation  (HRI)  Training.    HRI  training  may  be  mandated  for  fliers involved  in  air  operations  over  specific  areas  within  or  flying  into  a  combatant  command AOR  during  contingency  operations.    When  so  designated,  the  training  requirement  is identified by a combatant command in the AOR OPORD for the contingency.   HRI training may be accomplished via briefer-led training or Secure Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) web-based training (WBT) when available.  It is to be conducted by a certified Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) specialist.  Each ERCC UTC member tasked for deployment to  a  combat  zone  where  a  requirement  for  HRI  is  identified  attends  HRI  training  prior  to deployment  as  per  respective  theater  reporting  instructions.    HRI  training  is  good  for  three years  (consult  applicable  AFI  for  current  training  reset  guidance).    To  schedule  an  HRI briefing,  contact  your  local  SERE  specialist.   If  a  local  SERE  specialist  is  not AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 41 assigned/available,  schedule  training  as  per  CCMD  reporting  instruction  or  contact MAJCOM  SERE  Functional  Manager  (FM)  for  additional  information/direction.    After  the training  is  complete,  a  copy  of  the  training  certificate,  AF  Form  1522,  or  other documentation record should be retained in the individual’s ERCC training.  Training is also recorded  on  the  Isolated  Personnel  Report  (ISOPREP),  block  24.    Prior  to  training,  all personnel must have their security clearance (Secret) verified by their unit ERCC coordinator or readiness office. 6.4.7.1.  DD Form 1833, Isolated Personnel Report (ISOPREP).  ISOPREPs are prepared for  all  HRI  personnel.      The  ISOPREP  contains  information  designed  to  identify  and authenticate  an  evader  by  a  recovery  force.    An  ISOPREP  is  prepared  by  home-station intelligence  personnel  for  deploying  members  prior  to  departure  to  an  AOR  where ISOPREP  and  HRI  training  is  required.    It  contains  personal  data  known  only  to  the isolated individual and is used by recovery forces to positively authenticate the survivor.  An initial form is completed and then reviewed at least every 6 months.  Once completed, the  ISOPREP  is  classified  Confidential  and  is  maintained  by  the  appropriate  unit intelligence, SERE, or operations personnel. 6.4.8.  N95  Mask  Fit  Testing/Training.    ERCC  personnel  are  potentially  exposed  to  highly communicable diseases during patient care and transport.  N95 respirators are Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) approved for PPE and provided in the allowance standard.  Personnel should be medically cleared, fit-tested, and trained for wear of an N95 respirator  prior  to  first  use.    Personnel  receive  subsequent  fit-testing  and  training  annually.  Reference  Air  Force  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Standard  (AFOSHSTD)  48-137, Respiratory  Protection  Program,  for  specific  requirements  and  contact  the  supporting occupational health staff for support. 42 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 Chapter 7 LOGISTICS & EQUIPMENT 7.1.  Aircraft Medical Equipment Operations. 7.1.1.  Medical  equipment  and  supplies  are  vital  to  the  ERCC  mission.    There  are  many hazards associated with dynamic in-flight environmental conditions that are not encountered in  fixed  medical  treatment  facilities.    Equipment  used  onboard  aircraft  must  continue  to operate  properly  under  flight  conditions.    It  is  essential  that  ERCC  members  know  the capability and performance limitations of equipment items in the ERCC equipment UTCs. 7.1.2.  All  medical  equipment  intended  for  use  during  aircraft  operations  is  tested,  deemed airworthy and approved prior to use in the aircraft environment.  Every effort should be made to utilize the medical equipment provided in the allowance standard. 7.1.3.  Some  medical  equipment  is  incompatible  with  the  airborne  environment.    Medical equipment  approved  for  use  during  aircraft  operations  is  identified  in  AFI  10-2909, Aeromedical  Evacuation  Equipment  Standards,  and/or  the  AE  Equipment  Compendium.  AMC ensures standardization for medical equipment used system-wide. 7.2.  Medical  Equipment  Waiver  Protocol.  At  times,  patient  medical  requirements  may necessitate  the  use  of  non-standard  medical  equipment  that  is  not  provided  in  the  allowance standard  and  has  not  been  approved  for  flight.    AMC/A3VM  is  the  waiver  authority  for  non-certified/non-standard medical equipment required for patient moves.  Waiver requests should be routed as follows:  hospital/MTF notifies the appropriate PMRC; PMRC contacts appropriate C2 agency; C2 agency contacts 618 AOC AE Cell; AE Cell contacts AMC/A3VM.  A3VM consults with  the  AE  Equipment  Lab  during  their  hours  of  operation.    Further  consultation  on  aircraft impact  of  non-certified/non-standard  equipment  occurs  with  the  Global  Patient  Movement Requirements Center (GPMRC) Validating Flight Surgeon on duty. 7.2.1.  Waiver will be obtained prior to use of non-certified/non-standard equipment onboard the aircraft and will apply only to that specific mission.  (T-1).  In order to prevent mission delays, verbal waivers may be obtained from AMC/A3VM (reference AFI 11-2AEV3). 7.3.  Medical  Equipment  Malfunction/Failure.  During  flight  operations  on  AE  missions, ERCC  teams  will  notify  the  MCD  immediately  when  medical  equipment  malfunctions  or  fails during  operation  on  a  mission.    On  return  to  home  station  or  deployed  location,  the  team  will notify  local  or  unit-supported  medical  maintenance  organization  of  unusual  or  repeated equipment failure and safety incidents.  (T-1). 7.3.1.  If  equipment  malfunction/failure  occurs  during  an  AE  mission,  the  ERCC  Team Chief,  in  collaboration  with  the  MCD,  ensures  the  following  documentation/actions  are accomplished:  1) complete AF 4449, En Route Care Equipment Malfunction Report Tag; if unavailable,  complete  AFTO  350,  Repairable  Item  Processing  Tag;  2)  complete  DD  Form 2852.  For non-AE missions (no MCD/AECMs on board), the ERCC Team Chief ensures the documentation is accomplished. 7.3.1.1.  Completion of AF 4449 (If unavailable, complete AFTO 350.). AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 43 7.3.1.1.1.  When  medical  equipment  is  found  to  be  non-operational  or  operating outside of acceptable parameters, and troubleshooting attempts have failed to rectify the situation, disconnect the device and fill out AF 4449.  Any ERCC team member or  AECM  may  complete  the  form.    Give  a  detailed  description  of  the  equipment problem  and  circumstances  leading  to  the  discovery  of  the  problem.    Include statement listing any attachment(s) to  the device, and any  effect  on attachment(s) to the  device.    Attach  the  AF  4449  to  the  piece  of  equipment  for  turn-in.    (Example description:    “During  pre-flight  of  326M  suction  unit,  tried  to  adjust  suction  to 100mmHg but only able to obtain 75mmHg w/knob turned to max; normal should be 0  to  550mmHg.”)    It  is  important  that  all  settings,  dials,  etc.  be  left  as  they  were during the incident.  Do not turn the knobs or change settings, if possible. 7.3.1.1.2.  Upon arrival to home station/deployed location, immediately sequester and send  tagged  equipment  and  all  accessories  (cords,  supplies,  etc.)  attached  to  the equipment  to  home  station/deployed  location  medical  maintenance  organization.  Medical maintenance will impound the equipment and conduct an investigation of the malfunction. 7.3.1.2.  Completion of DD Form 2852. 7.3.1.2.1.  If an equipment malfunction occurs, the ERCC Team Chief and the MCD collaborate  to  complete,  or  direct  completion  of,  DD  Form  2852  and  document  the issue immediately after the occurrence.  (For non-AE missions – no MCD/AECMs on board  –  the  ERCC  Team  Chief  ensures  the  documentation  is  accomplished.)    Upon return to home station or deployed location, the DD Form 2852 is turned in to the AE element Patient Safety Monitor who then enters the event into the AE Patient Safety Database tool.  (NOTE:  Anyone with knowledge of the incident may complete a DD Form 2852.) 7.3.1.2.2.  Provide  as  complete  a  description  of  the  malfunction  as  possible  and  the operating  conditions  when  the  malfunction  occurred;  identify  make,  model,  serial number,  AF  Form  4368,  Scheduled  Maintenance  and  Certification  Label,  or  DD Form  2163,  Medical  Equipment  Verification  Certification,  information,  and  what other equipment/power was involved.  Provide circumstances leading to the event and include  any  pertinent  information  such  as:    O2  source,  patient  activity,  turbulence, cabin altitude, trouble-shooting attempted, etc., as may be applicable.  Also, provide names of individuals involved and contact information. 7.3.1.2.3.  When  equipment  malfunction  affects  the  aircraft,  the  MCD  notifies  the Pilot  In Command and provides details of the incident to facilitate mishap reporting (to be forwarded to wing safety).  On non-AE missions, the ERCC Team Chief will notify the PIC and provide details of the incident. 7.4.  ERCC  Allowance  Standards  (AS).  ERCC  UTC  equipment  packages  are  to  be  used  in conjunction with the standard AE or ERC in-flight kit to provide focused critical care capability. 7.4.1.  ERCC  UTC  Sets.    When  ERCC  UTCs  deploy  into  a  theater  of  operations  each personnel UTC is paired with an ERCC equipment kit to support patient transport missions.  ERCC equipment UTCs are positioned at a location for each ERCC personnel UTC deployed there.    Each  team  at  a  deployed  location  is  assigned  a  kit,  and  it  is  be  that  team’s  primary 44 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 responsibility  to  inventory,  maintain,  and  restock  bag  sets;  and,  ensure  equipment  is recharged  between  missions.      Patient  Movement  Item  (PMI)  bar  codes  are  attached  to  the ERCC equipment once in theater to facilitate tracking of those assets. 7.4.1.1.  During  continuous  contingency  support  operations,  ERCC  teams  may  be deployed  for  limited  time  periods  with  subsequent,  follow-on  ERCC  teams  deployed  in “rotations” in place of a previous team.  In such cases, ERCC kits should be inventoried, re-stocked,  and  re-packaged  as  per  the  UTC  pack-out  guide,  then  handed  over  to  the newly  deployed  ERCC  team  for  use  during  their  rotation  period.    Unless  otherwise directed, ERCC kits should remain at the deployed location until the end of the operation. 7.4.2.  Standard  Operations.    While  performing  patient  care  duties,  ERCC  teams  should utilize  equipment  from  their  ERCC  kits  to  the  fullest  extent.    When  an  ERCC  team  has exhausted equipment items from their assigned ERCC kit, the team should utilize equipment to the extent possible from the PMI system, if a PMI pool of equipment has been tasked and deployed  to  support  an  ongoing  and  sustained  contingency  operation.    Note:    This  is  only applicable  at  present  to  the  CENTCOM  AOR  and  any  future  contingency  operations  that may  be  established  and  ongoing.    There  is  no  PMI  pool  of  equipment  established  for “peacetime” operations.  Sending MTFs identify patient movement equipment requirements in the PMR. 7.4.2.1.  When picking up multiple patients  at  a facility in  a theater that  is  a PMI node, the  sending  facility  will  provide  additional  PMI  equipment  in  cases  where  the  ERCC UTC  allowance  standard  is  exhausted.    The  sending  facility  will  also  provide  non-standard theater-specific PMI-traced items not on the ERCC UTC allowance standard  – as  may  be  required  for  patient  care  (some  examples  include:  negative  pressure  wound vacuum pumps, sequential compression devices, pain control pumps, etc.) – with enough supplies to support the patient during flight. 7.4.2.2.  When transporting multiple patients from a facility that is not a theater PMI node and  the  ERCC  team  anticipates  its  allowance  standard  will  be  exhausted  or  that  PMI equipment not on the ERCC UTC allowance standard will be required to perform a safe transport, the ERCC team must bring the additional PMI from their originating location (PMI node). 7.4.2.3.  For  situations  in  which  ground  time  is  limited  due  to  the  tactical  situation,  the ERCC team  may trade equipment  items  from  its allowance standard for like PMI items from  the sending facility.  This  practice will expedite patient  assessment and packaging prior to transport, but it will not result in a net gain or loss of PMI for either the ERCC team or the sending facility.  The return exchange of this equipment must be coordinated by the sending facility and the ERCC team as it is on different Defense Medical Logistic Support System (DMLSS) accountable records to ensure local equipment accountability and integrity is maintained. 7.4.3.  ERCC  UTC  Allowance  Standards  have  defined  capability  to  support  specific  types and numbers of patients. 7.4.3.1.  FFCC4,  Adult  CCATT  Kit.    This  UTC  provides  advanced  specialty  medical equipment  to  support  personnel  UTC  FFCCT.    Each  UTC  FFCC4  has  the  capability  to support  up  to  three  high-acuity,  ventilated  patients  or  up  to  six  lower-acuity,  non-AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 45 ventilated  patients  per  intra-  or  inter-theater  mission  –  depending  on  patient  acuity.    A basic adult mission would require the adult kit with initial 72-hour capability.  Each kit is only good for one mission support and will require replenishment at mission end. 7.4.3.2.  FFCCB,  CCATT  Equipment  Resupply.    This  UTC  provides  the  re-supply package  to  support  FFCC4;  it  provides  15  days  support  for  up  to  three  basic  FFCC4 packages. 7.4.3.3.  FFCC2,  ERCC  Pediatric  Equipment  Augmentation.    This  UTC  provides advanced  specialty  medical  equipment/supply  augmentation  support  to  the  FFCC4 equipment  UTC  specifically  for  transport  of  pediatric  patients,  except  for  a  transport incubator.  This kit provides single mission support for a maximum of 2 pediatric patients weighing < 15 kg, and, a maximum of 2 pediatric patients weighing between 15 – 40 kg.  Re-supply is provided within the AE system at staging locations or supported element. 7.4.3.3.1.  Pediatric  Support  Operations.    During  operations  where  ERCC  teams  are deployed in support of critical care patient movements, there may be occasions when it  is  necessary  to  transport  pediatric  patients.    UTC  FFCC4  does  not  provide equipment  to  support  pediatric  patients.    UTC  FFCC2  was  developed  to  provide additional  equipment/supplies  to  UTC  FFCC4  to  support  FFCCT  when  a  team  is required  to  transport  pediatric  patients.    Close  coordination  between  the  PMRC,  the tasking  authority,  and  the  ERCC  team  considering  such  factors  as  patient  acuity, transport care requirements, age, weight, and size of child is necessary in determining which team may be most appropriate for a pediatric transport mission. 7.4.3.4.  FFEC1,  Expeditionary  Support  Package.    This  UTC  provides  basic  shelter  to ERCC teams and AE crewmembers positioned at far-forward, secured airfields.  Package is  deployed  with  FFCCT  and/or  AE  crewmembers  (UTC  FFQDE)  when  required  to support  a  maximum  of  30  personnel  for  96  hours.    Base  operating  support  (BOS)  is required  for  food  service,  bio-environmental  engineering,  security,  logistics,  fuel,  and civil engineering. 7.4.3.5.  FFTC1,  Medical  Tactical  Critical  Care  Augmentation  (equipment  only).    UTC FFTC1  provides  advanced  specialty  medical  equipment  to  UTC  FFTCT  (TCCET)  to transport  critical,  post-surgical,  polytrauma  casualties  on  tactical  intra-theater  airlift.  Each equipment kit provides single mission support for up to three patients.  Resupply is provided by staging base/MTF. 7.4.4.  Allowance standards, including packing lists and pharmaceutical lists for kits, can be found on the Air Force Medical  Logistics website.  The allowance standard designation for the various equipment UTCs are as follows: 7.4.4.1.  FFCC4 – Adult Basic Kit:  887N 7.4.4.2.  FFCCB – Adult Basic Kit Re-supply:  887H 7.4.4.3.  FFCC2 – Pediatric Augmentation to Adult Basic Kit:  887O 7.4.4.4.  FFEC1 – Expeditionary Support Package:  903N 7.4.4.5.  FFTC1 – Medical Tactical Critical Care Augmentation:  887C 46 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 7.5.  Pre-flight  of  Equipment.  Pre-flight  medical  equipment  prior  to  each  mission  as  per process defined in AFI 10-2909, Aeromedical Evacuation Equipment Standards).  Note:  ERCC equipment with non-current calibration and servicing dates will not be used.  Equipment assets found  to  be  out  of  service  date  will  be  immediately  turned  over  to  the  host  biomedical maintenance  activity  for  service.    When  deployed,  teams  are  responsible  to  frequently  assess assigned equipment  operational  capability and  ensure adequate battery life.  ERCC teams  shall ensure  appropriate  charging  capabilities  are  available  for  equipment  prior  to  declaring  full operational capability.   (T-1).  Any item not listed in AFI 10-2909 or listed in the Aeromedical Evacuation  Non-PMI  (Non-Standard)  Medical  Equipment  Compendium  will  require  a  waiver prior to flight. 7.6.  Narcotics  Accountability.  ERCC  personnel  will  ensure  accountability  of  narcotics (reference AFI 48-307, Volume 1, and local guidance/policy).  (T-1). 7.7.  Base  Operating  Support.  Integration  of  deployed  ERCC  teams  is  critical  to  successful ERC operations.  ERCC teams are not stand-alone units.  The gaining AE or ERC unit shall be responsible  for  providing  all  required  support  to  the  ERCC  teams,  including  billeting,  food, water,  shelter,  power,  transportation,  medical  oxygen  support,  computer  support,  and communications.    During  missions  away  from  home  base,  ERCC  teams  shall  receive  base  ops support from  the  appropriate en-route  element.    (T-1).  UTC  FFEC1  should  be deployed  when ERCC  teams  are  engaged  in  a  bare-base  deployment  with  early-entry  ERC  forces  without  full logistical support from the gaining base. 7.8.  Resupply  and  Patient  Movement  Items  (PMI).  Teams  coordinate  with  MTF/ERC medical logistics personnel for repair/maintenance/replacement of PMI.  PMI maintenance issues should  be  coordinated  with  the  Medical  Equipment  Repair  element  associated  with  the  closest MTF.   (T-1).  PMI is tracked by utilizing the PMI Tracking System (PMITS) when and where available.  Accountability is maintained on a Custodian Receipt Locator List (CRLL) at the host MTF DMLSS under RCCC XX5881.  All members are required to scan PMI assets each time a piece  of  PMI  changes  status  (i.e.  PMITS  codes:    QA  for  maintenance,  OUT,  and  RDY,  etc.).  ERCC team  members are responsible for scanning all PMI in  their allowance standard prior to and  after  each  mission.    (T-2).    Sending  MTFs  identify  patient  movement  equipment requirements in the PMR and are responsible for providing these items and a one-day minimum of medical supplies. 7.8.1.  Patient  Movement  Item  In-transit  Visibility  Tracking.    Supported  units  actively  scan equipment assets using PMITS.  These assets should be clearly labeled with PMI bar codes and  scanned  no  less  than  monthly  for  in-garrison  activities  and  at  least  every  two  to  three days in a deployed area.  All assets should be scanned each time they move in or out of the unit  and/or  change  from  RDY  to  QA  status  to  provide  in-transit  visibility.    Assets  without labels  (not  bar  coded)  or  needing  additional  labels  must  be  identified/reported  to:  hqamcpmi@us.af.mil  or  the  nearest  PMI  Center.    Labels  are  validated  and,  if  approved, prepared and sent to the appropriate unit. 7.9.  Operational  CCATT Kit  Program.  AMC/SG MEFPAK Branch (AMC/SGXM) Support and Sustainment Guidelines for Regular Air Force & ARC Operational CCATT Kits: 7.9.1.  General.  AMC/SG provides initial outfitting of approved/validated operational UTC FFCC4  kit  to  support  local,  home-station  CCATT  training.    These  operational  kits  may  be tasked to  support live, real-world  mission requirements.  AMC/SG may  also  provide initial AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 47 outfitting of a limited number of operational kits for other ERCC capabilities, such as formal training  organizations.    AMC/SG  also  provides  supply  replenishment  and  sustainment  of those kits at no expense to the supported unit, with the following exceptions:  narcotics and refrigerated items.  Equipment maintenance support and repair or replacement of kit items is a local unit funded responsibility.  This operational kit support program may be continued by AMC/SG  as  long  as  funding  is  available.    NOTE:    ARC  units  requesting  assignment  of  a CCATT  Operational  Kit  should  have  a  minimum  of  two  UTC  FFCCT  members  assigned.  Assigned  members  will  have  completed,  at  a  minimum,  the  CCAT  Initial  Course  to  be eligible for assignment of a CCATT Operational Kit to their unit. 7.9.1.1.  Operational kits shall be maintained by the units to which they are assigned in a “Mission Ready” state.  Units will report the readiness status of these assets quarterly to AMC/SGXM.    Contact  AMC/SGXM  for  guidance  and  report  format.    The  daily maintenance,  repair,  and  asset  accountability  is  the  responsibility  of  the  assigned organization.   Tracking and use of these additional operational kits will follow the same guidance as provided for FFCC4 WRM kits.  Each supported organization must provide adequate  storage,  oversight,  protection,  management  attention,  and  periodic  inventory support  to  ensure  proper  maintenance  of  the  kit.    (T-2).    The  operational  kits  are  not WRM assets.  It is understood, after periodic training activities, items in the kits may be expended or damaged during training, rendering the kit “Not Mission Ready” for a brief period.    In  such  cases,  expended  or  damaged  items  should  be  ordered,  repaired  and/or replaced, as per the guidance herein, as soon as possible after the training event.  This is to ensure operational kits are returned to “Mission Ready” status expeditiously. 7.9.1.2.  Operational  kits  are  intended  for  frequent,  active  use  to  support  local  team training and exercise support, as well as operational mission use.  On occasion, CCATTs may be tasked to deploy with an Operational CCATT Kit that is assigned to their home-station unit.  Most likely, such occurrences would be in support of DSCA, disaster relief, or humanitarian operations.  When deploying with an Operational CCATT Kit, CCATTs are  responsible  for  inventory,  maintenance,  re-stocking  and  utilization  of  Operational Kits, just the same as during combat operations.  However, Operational CCATT Kits do not  remain  during  an  event  for  use  by  any  subsequent,  deployed  CCATT.    When  a CCATT is tasked to deploy with an Operational CCATT Kit from its home-station unit, the  team  should  ensure  the  Operational  CCATT  Kit  returns  with  the  team  upon  re-deployment back to home-station. 7.9.2.  Operational  Kit  Re-Supply/Sustainment.    UTC  FFCC4  consists  of  a  series  of bag/containers  packed-out  in  accordance  with  Allowance  Standard  887N.    Allowance standards  can  be  found  on  the  Air  Force  Medical  Operations  Agency  (AFMOA)  SGALX Readiness  UTC  website.    Contact  AMC/SGXM  for  supply  replenishment  for  operational kits.  Supply replenishment for CCATT Operational Kits will be furnished in the lowest unit-of-measure quantities.   (Exception:   AMC/SGXM does not furnish narcotics or refrigerated items  in  the  operational  kit.    It  is  the  unit’s  responsibility  to  establish  appropriate  supply support  from  their  host  unit  for  these  items.)    A  request  for  supplies  that  are  not  on  the FFCC4  AS  is  the  responsibility  of  the  local  organization  and  will  not  be  accepted  or supported  by  AMC/SGXM.   Supply  replenishment  orders  should  be  placed  as needed/supplies are consumed, but not more frequently than once every week.  Orders may be  submitted  via  furnished  shopping  guide  electronically  via  e-mail  to  the  AMC/SGXM 48 AFI48-307V2  10 JANUARY 2017 Operational  Kit  Support  Program  organizational  account:    SG/SGXM.Opkits@us.af.mil.  Telephone orders may be submitted (commercial 618-229-6952 or DSN 312-779-6952), but will be limited to 10 items or less due to the total number of items in the kit.  Shipments to the requesting units will be within 10 duty days after receipt of order and will usually be via the  most  economical  method.    Premium  transportation  (such  as  Federal  Express  overnight) will require a commercial carrier account number, i.e. FEDEX or USPS, from the requesting activity.  During contingencies, resupply will be through the designated Theater Lead Agent for  Medical  Materiel.    Contact  AMC/SGXM  for  additional  information  on  unit  procedures and responsibilities. 7.9.3.  Medical  Equipment/PMI.    Medical  equipment  furnished  for  this  program  belongs  to the  AF  PMI  Program  and  will  be  maintained  on  host  medical  treatment  facility  Medical Equipment Management Office (MEMO) accountable records on account XX5881 for global visibility.  Biomedical equipment maintenance services support will continue to be from the supporting activity and/or regional Medical Equipment Repair Center (MERC).  ARC units with  an  operational  kit  assigned  must  establish  an  appropriate  Memorandum  of Understanding  (MOU)  or  Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA)  with  their  host  medical treatment  facility  for  maintenance  of  the  PMI  within  the  kit.    (T-2).    Expenses  for  normal repair  and/or  replacement  due  to  loss/damage  are  the  responsibility  of  the  local  unit.  Equipment accessories not maintained on the AS, or above the AS authorized quantity, will be the unit’s responsibility to replace.  AMC/SG will provide the initial outfitting quantities of the equipment, program for replacements when a change in make/model is designated, and manage system-wide modifications to equipment based on the AS. 7.9.4.  Quality Assurance (QA) Program.    Scott PMI Center will help  ensure all supporting units  receive  quality  assurance  action  messages.    This  includes  recall  notices  and  quality assurance  messages  from  AFMOA.    This  does  not  relieve  the  unit  from  responsibility  of managing their own quality assurance program. 7.9.5.  Return  Goods  Program.    ARC  units  with  operational  kits  assigned  will  process outdated/recalled  drugs  through  their  host  medical  treatment  facility  as  per  procedures defined in AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics Support) and local policies/regulations.  (T-2). 7.9.6.  Annual  Inventory  and  Test.    Inventory  and  test  assigned  Operational  CCATT  Kit equipment annually.  (T-2).  Operational testing will involve team members and is defined as full set-up, turning equipment on, performing function checks, validated all necessary pieces and  accessories  are  available  and  in  fully  operational  condition,  and  re-packing  the assemblage for future training or potential operational use.
