Nursing Services.  Under the executive leadership of a nursing administrator, as defined in AFPD 46-1, Nursing Services is the structure through which services are provided by registered nurses  and  additional  nursing  personnel.    These  include  military,  government  service  civilian (GS), contract and volunteer registered nurses.  Additional Nursing Services personnel includes GS,  contract,  and  volunteer  licensed  practical/vocational  nurses,  aerospace  medical  service apprentices,  journeymen,  and  craftsmen,  medical  technicians  and  other  unlicensed  assistive personnel all whom reside under the realm of the executive leadership of nursing administrators who  are  responsible  for  all  aspects  of  nursing  care  and  practice.    The  primary  goal  of  Nursing Services is the delivery of the highest quality of competent, compassionate, efficient, evidence-based  and  cost-effective  nursing  care  to  individuals,  families,  groups,  and  communities  in support of home station and global medical operations.  Additional informational resources and documents can be found on AFMOA/SGNE Kx site. 1.2.  Organizational  Structure.  Nursing  Services  in  active  duty  medical  treatment  facilities (MTFs)  will  be  organized  in  accordance  with  Air  Force  Medical  Service  (AFMS)  Flight  Path guidance and duty titles will be consistent with the Flight Path.   (T-1). Nursing Services in Air Force Reserve Medical  Units (RMUs), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) Medical Units (GMUs) will be organized in accordance with AFRC/SG, ANG/SG as  well  as  local  guidance.    (T-1).  Nursing  Services  in  AD,  AFR  and  ANG  Aeromedical Evacuation Squadrons will be organized IAW Air Mobility Command guidance and AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization.  (T-1). 1.2.1.  As the functional advisor for Nursing Services, the Chief Nurse (CN) will be readily identifiable at the executive level on the organizational chart. 1.2.2.  The professional nursing “chain of command” is separate and distinct from the official organizational  chain  of  command  or  line  authority.    Nursing  personnel  will  activate  the functional/professional  nursing  or  clinical  “chain”  to  address  nursing  issues,  concerns,  and conflicts concerning but not limited to nursing administration, nursing practice, and nursing care that cannot be resolved at a lower level.  (T-1). 1.2.3.  For  inpatient  MTFs,  a  senior  nurse  will  be  designated  as  the  “in-house”  nursing supervisor or administrative nurse on call, and will be available for immediate consultation.  (T-  2). Ambulatory care facilities will adopt similar administrative practice and structure as deemed  necessary  by  the  CN.    (T-2).    The  senior  nurse  is  empowered  to  contact  the  CN, Chief,  Medical  Staff,  and/or  other  personnel  deemed  appropriate  to  facilitate  problem resolution as necessary.

Additional  guidance  on  personal  and  non-personal  service  contracts  can  be  found  in  AFI  44-119.    (T-0).    ANG  4N0/4N1  who  are licensed LP/VN in their civilian occupations will follow guidance for military AFSC.  In the inpatient/outpatient clinical setting, the civilian equivalent to the clinical practice of a 4N0 is a LVN.   14  AFI46-101  30 JANUARY 2015 Chapter 4 STANDARDS OF NURSING CARE AND PRACTICE 4.1.  Definition of Nursing Care.  Definitions of nursing care are based on the nursing process.  Every organization must define nursing care and identify areas in the facility/unit where nursing care  is  delivered.    The  following  guidance  will  be  considered  when  developing  organization-specific definitions of nursing care: 4.1.1.  The applicable state nurse practice act where applies.  (T-0). 4.1.2.  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  guidelines,  AF  policies,  directives  and  instructions.  (T-0). 4.1.3.  The  standards  of  clinical  nursing  practice  published  by  professional  nursing organizations.  (T-0). 4.1.4.  Nursing  Scope  and  Standards  of  Practice,  current  edition,  American  Nurses Association.  (T-0). 4.2.  Standards of Nursing Care.  Standards of care are authoritative statements that describe a competent  level  of  nursing  care  as  demonstrated  by  the  nursing  process  through  assessment, diagnosis, outcome identification, planning, implementation, and evaluation. 4.2.1.  The  Standards  of  Care  chapter  in  the  “Standards  of  Clinical  Nursing  Practice” published  by  the  ANA  forms  the  basis  for  professional  nursing  care  within  AF  Nursing Services. 4.2.2.  The CN ensures written administrative and clinical guidance and procedures directing the  provision  of  nursing  care  are  current  and  available  in  all  patient  care  areas.    At  a minimum, directives should address: 4.2.2.1.  Standards published by professional nursing organizations adopted for use. 4.2.2.2.  Specific  nursing  standards  of  care  if  required  by  regulatory  agencies  including the DoD, AFMS, The Joint Commission, and AAAHC. 4.2.2.3.  Method(s) to measure, assess, and improve patient outcomes. 4.2.2.4.  Method(s) to review and revise standards of care, including review by the CN. 4.3.  Standards  of  Nursing  Practice.  Standards  of  practice  are  authoritative  statements  that describe  a  level  of  care  or  performance  common  to  the  profession  of  nursing  by  which  the quality  of  nursing  practice  can  be  judged.    The  “Code  for  Nurses”  and  the  Standards  of Professional Performance Chapter in the “Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice” published by the  ANA  form  the  basis  for  a  competent  level  of  behavior  expected  of  AF  Nursing  Services personnel. 4.4.  Scope  of  Practice.  Scope  of  practice  refers  to  the  range  of  responsibilities/activities registered  nurses  and/or  other  licensed  nursing  service  personnel  are  educated,  trained  and authorized to perform.  Enlisted practice is IAW skills per CFETP. 4.5.  Authorization for Extended Scope of Practice.  The Air Force may, for the purpose of its mission, utilize nurses for tasks that may be beyond those authorized by the state that issued the AFI46-101  30 JANUARY 2015   15  individual’s license.  Similarly, aerospace medical service technicians may be asked to perform tasks beyond their normal training and standards of competency as outlined in their CFETP. 4.5.1.  Utilization  of  nurses  and  aerospace  medical  service  technicians  (4NXXX)  for extended scope of practice must meet three criteria: 4.5.1.1.  The expanded scope of the task or procedure must be mission essential.  (T-1). 4.5.1.2.  The member must be trained for the expanded scope by a competent trainer and that training must be documented.  (T-1). 4.5.1.3.  The expanded role is restricted solely to military mission performance. 4.5.2.  When  the  medical  leadership  or  health  care  team  decides  an  RN  needs  to  perform clinical  tasks  outside  his/her  scope  of  care,  or  a  4NXXX  needs  to  perform  tasks  not  in  the CFETP, the organization must request a Scope of Practice Waiver along with a copy of the lesson  plan  for  waiver  approval.    Such  requests  will  be  accomplished  IAW  AFI  44-119, Chapter 7.  (T-1).  For ANG, Scope of practice waivers must be routed and approved by the respective  Air  National  Guard  Readiness  Center/Command  Surgeons  Office  (ANGRC/SG) 4N0X1  MFM  and  then  forwarded  to  the  AF  4N0X1/4N1X1  Career  Field  Manager  for approval/concurrence. Annual review and approval is required.  (T-1). 4.6.  Nursing  Responsibilities.  Include  but  are  not  limited  to  the  following  high  risk  problem prone areas: 4.6.1.  Telehealth Nursing. 4.6.1.1.  Telehealth  nursing,  as  defined  by  the  American  Academy  of  Ambulatory  Care Nursing  (AAACN),  is  the  delivery,  management,  and  coordination  of  care  and  services provided  via  telecommunications  technology  within  the  domain  of  nursing.    It  includes any  encounter  that  results  in  assessment  and  management  of  acute  and  episodic  health care  concerns,  health  maintenance  and  promotion,  disease  prevention  and  management, patient  education and counseling, patient  advocacy,  case management, and coordination of care for patients throughout the health care system.  Telehealth nursing includes such components  as  nursing  triage,  home  care  advice  which  might  be  considered  part  of  the triage process, providing health care information, and care coordination. 4.6.1.2.  Telehealth  nurses  are  licensed  registered  nurses  with  at  least  three  years  of clinical experience in various settings who have demonstrated appropriate knowledge and skills necessary to provide safe and effective telehealth nursing care and service.   (T-0).  This requirement for a minimum of 3 years of “demonstrated competence in all aspects of nursing  care  and  independent  decision  making”  comes  from  AAACN’s  “A  Guide  to Ambulatory Care Nursing Orientation and Competency Assessment” (2005).  (T-0).  The years of experience can be waived on a case-by-case basis as assessed and recommended by  the  local  CN  to  the  Air  Force  Medical  Operations  Agency  (AFMOA)  CN.    (T-2).  Clinical  experience  in  pediatrics,  obstetrics  and  medical-surgical  nursing  is  highly desirable. 4.6.1.2.1.  Telehealth nursing practice requiring patient triage, home care advice and involving  symptom-based  decision-making  will  be  guided  by  the  use  of  clinical decision support tools that are verified and documented according to nursing practice standards.  (T-0).   16  AFI46-101  30 JANUARY 2015 4.6.1.2.2.  Nursing  service  personnel  use  of  nationally  recognized  nursing  triage protocols, algorithms, or guidelines will be coordinated between the CN and Chief of Medical  Staff,  and  approved  and  reviewed  initially  and  at  least  annually  by  the Executive Committee of Medical Staff (ECOMS).  (T-1). 4.6.1.3.  All  telehealth  calls  involving  nursing  decision-making  will  be  documented  as telecons  in  the  electronic  health  record  (eHR)  and  coded  appropriately.    (T-1).  Symptom-based  calls  requiring  decision-making  will  be  signed  by  the  nurse  providing care and reviewed and co-signed by a privileged provider within 24 hours.  (T-1). 4.6.1.4.  Telehealth  nursing  is  not  meant  to  be  the  primary  function  of  the  ambulatory care nurse.  Process improvement efforts should be carried out locally to channel calls to the appropriate office, such as calls that might be more appropriately handled by Referral Management,  TRICARE,  Disease  Management,  or  Case  Management.    Additionally, internal  processes  should  be  evaluated  and  managed  to  maximize  effectiveness  of  each clinic’s telehealth nursing practice, such as MTF procedures for medication renewals. 4.6.1.5.  The CN is responsible for ensuring local guidance and procedures for telehealth nursing  practice  are  written  to  include  such  parameters  as:  the  clinical  decision  support tools,  protocols,  guidelines  and  the  documentation  requirements;  appropriate  staff training  and  competencies  documentation;  clinical  chain  of  command;  deviation  from protocol guidance; and a peer review process.  (T-0). 4.6.1.6.  MTF  guidance  and  procedures  for  telehealth  nursing  practice  should  mirror AAACN’s  Telehealth  Nursing  Practice  Administration  and  Practice  Standards,  current edition. 4.6.2.  Medication  Practice.  Patient  safety  is  paramount.    The  CN  must  ensure  medication administration  is  conducted  IAW  DoD  and  Air  Force  guidance  and  accepted  standards  of practice as defined by The Joint Commission and National Patient Safety Standards.  (T-0).  Nursing  Services  personnel  must  comply  with  The  Joint  Commission  “Do  Not  Use” terminology, the National  Patient  Safety Goals,  as well as the following  basic principles of medication practice.  (T-0). 4.6.2.1.  MTFs  must  develop  a local  computational  pharmacy  and  medication administration  test  to  validate  competency  before  allowing  Licensed  Registered  and Vocational nurses to administer medications IAW their scope of practice.  Upon meeting local  requirements,  competency  is  validated  and  documented  in  the  member’s Competency Assessment Folder (CAF) or electronic equivalent. 4.6.2.2.  4N0s may administer medications after completion of:  5-Level CFETP training and a computational pharmacology and medication administration test.  Competency will be validated and documented in the member’s CFETP. 4.6.2.2.1.  Section-specific  medication  administration  lists  will  be  coordinated  with the  CN  and  Chief,  Medical  Staff,  and  approved  by  the  Executive  Committee  of  the Medical  Staff  (ECOMS).    (T-1).    Aeromedical  Evacuation  Squadrons,  RMUs  and GMUs  will  coordinate medication  administration  lists  with  the  senior  physician  and the Executive Management Committee (EMC) (or equivalent).  (T-1). AFI46-101  30 JANUARY 2015   17  4.6.2.2.2.  4N0s  will  not  accept  verbal  orders  for  medication  administration.  (Exception:  IDMTs in a remote geographically separated area or paramedics on field response will follow published protocols.)  (T-1)  Verbal orders taken by a Registered Nurse is addressed in section 6.2. 4.6.2.2.3.  IDMTs/Paramedics/4N0  7-9 intravenous medications  IAW  with  their  CFETP  or  published  protocols  and  with  appropriate training, validation and documentation. levels  may administer 4.6.2.3.  Nursing  Services  personnel  must  have  thoroughly  written,  dated,  signed  orders for medication administration to include the name of the drug, dosage of the drug, route of the drug, and frequency or time of administration.  (T-1).  In the AD MTF outpatient setting, a prescription placed in the eHR to the pharmacy does not constitute an order for medication administration purposes.  (T-1). 4.6.2.4.  Registered  Nurses  and corticosteroids, psychotropics and antibiotics.  (T-1). IDMTs  cannot renew  controlled substances, 4.6.2.5.  All registered nurses inputting medication in CHCS/eHR must have documented training in order entry, computational pharmacology and medication administration.  (T-1). 4.6.2.6.  In MTFs, Primary Care Managers (PCMs) or competent  trainers  must train  the registered nurse on the use of the protocols and document the training in the nurse’s CAF or electronic equivalent.  (T-1). 4.6.2.7.  In  MTFs,  PCMs  or  a  competent  trainer  will  review  registered  nurse  protocol utilization competency annually.   (T-1).  If at any time a registered nurse is found to be deficient in the use of protocols they will have the medication ordering protocol/function removed from their scope of practice.  (T-1). 4.6.2.8.  Prescriptions  to  Outside  Pharmacies:    AF  nursing  personnel  may  not  call  in prescriptions to pharmacies (this does not apply to credentialed nurse providers).  In the event a patient is unable to pick up a written prescription, nursing service personnel may fax  the  prescription  to  the  designated  pharmacy  if  the  pharmacy  and  the  patient’s provider concur with this practice, and with permission of the patient.  (T-1). 4.6.3.  Clinical  Support  Staff  Protocols  (CSSPs).    For  Use  in  MTFs.  Clinical  Support  Staff Protocols can be used in the ambulatory care setting for providing coordinated care for high volume,  low  or  high  risk  symptoms  and/  or  diagnoses.    Examples:  sore  throat/strep  culture protocol  (high  volume/low  risk);  depression  screen  protocol  (high  volume/high  risk)  and chest pain protocol (low volume/high risk).  CSSPs are intended to increase patient access to care,  reduce  variations  in  clinical  practice  and  increase  the  support  staff’s  clinical competency  and  currency.    Protocols  are  intended  to  augment,  but  never  substitute,  for  a provider or nursing assessment of a patient.  The privileged provider is ultimately responsible for the assessment and care of the patient. 4.6.3.1.  CSSPs will be coordinated between the MTF SGN and SGH.  (T-1). 4.6.3.2.  CSSPs will include the following elements: 4.6.3.2.1.  Evidence-based  practice.  Evidence-based  practice  is  a  problem  solving approach to the delivery of health care that integrates the best evidence from clinical   18  AFI46-101  30 JANUARY 2015 inquiry  and  combines  it  with  patient  preferences  and  values  and  nursing  personnel expertise.  (T-2). 4.6.3.2.2.  Flow  chart  which  outlines  patient  flow  through  a  given  process  and includes  exclusionary  criteria  that  identifies  when  the  encounter  is  no  longer  within the scope of practice for support staff (i.e., “If temp of 102 degrees, must be seen by provider”).  (T-2). 4.6.3.2.3.  Training Plan  that identifies resources  and/or references for the evidence-based practice that the clinical support staff protocol is based upon.  (T-2). 4.6.3.2.4.  Training  of  clinical  support  staff  protocols  should  be  documented  in training record for aerospace medical service technicians and RNs.  (T-2). 4.6.3.2.5.  Standardized  documentation  of  encounter  using  eHR questionnaire.  (T-2). template  or 4.6.3.2.6.  Periodic peer review, both an initial and annual review.  (T-2). 4.6.3.3.  Completed CSSPs will be co-signed by the PCM.  (T-1). 4.6.4.  Clinical Inquiry.  Clinical inquiry is the ongoing process of questioning and evaluating nursing  practice,  providing  research  informed  patient  care,  and  creating  practice  changes through evidence-based practice, research utilization and experiential knowledge (American Association  of  Critical  Care  Nurses,  The  AACN  Synergy  Model  for  Patient  Care).    Key principles  of  a  culture  of  inquiry  include  the  inextricable  link  between  research/evidence-based knowledge, clinical practice and professional development and the link between these activities  and  the  strategic  goals  and  vision  of  the  organization.  The  performance  of evidence-based  practice  initiatives  through  the  translation  of  scholarship  or  research  into practice has the ultimate goal of improved care outcomes. 4.6.4.1.  Nursing  Services  personnel  will  promote  the  best  patient  outcomes  through participation in clinical inquiry at multiple levels of expertise, ranging from knowledge of research evidence to conducting research.  (T-0). 4.6.4.2.  Doctorally  prepared  nurses  (PhD  or  DNP)  who  are  assigned  to  a  MTF  or research  cell  are  responsible,  consistent  with  their  professional  education  and  role,  to promote  a  culture  of  inquiry,  conduct  and  facilitate  safe,  ethical,  and  efficient  research; translate  evidence  into  practice,  education,  leadership,  management,  and  policy;  mentor nurses  regarding  research  activities;  and  advise  CNs  about  research-related  topics. Additional informational resources and documents can be found on the Nursing Research consultant’s website located on the Kx site. AFI46-101  30 JANUARY 2015   19  Chapter 5 VERIFICATION OF NURSING COMPETENCY 5.1.  Definition  of  Competency  Assessment.  The  Chief  Nurse’s  role  is  to  ensure  there  is  a process to advance the culture of inquiry, to ensure continuing competency of nursing personnel and to systematically evaluate the outcomes of care and to ensure these advanced practice nurses are  used  to  their  optimum  capability.    Competency  assessment  is  a  continuous  process  that includes  but  is  not  limited  to  orientation,  license  verification,  certification  maintenance,  in-service  training,  continuing  education  and  skills/task  performance.    The  right  skill  mix,  job knowledge,  and  appropriate  competency  levels  of  staff  are  critical  factors  in  providing  quality patient  care  and  customer  service.    Competence  is  the  ability  of  a  staff  member  to  apply decision-making,  psychomotor,  and  interpersonal  skills  at  the  level  of  knowledge  expected  for the current duty position.  Competency is demonstrated by performance in a designated setting, consistent  with  established  standards  of  performance  determined  by  the  work  setting  and  the individual’s role in that setting. 5.2.  Competency  Assessment.  As  a  profession,  it  is  incumbent  upon  nursing  to  examine  and define  not  only  how  we  prepare  new  nurses  for  practice,  but  how  we  continue  to  advance  our practice  as  a  profession.    In  2006,  the  National  Council  of  State  Boards  of  Nursing  defined continuing  competency  as  “the  ongoing  ability  of  a  nurse  to  integrate  knowledge,  skills, judgment, and personal attributes to practice safely and ethically in a designated role and setting in  accordance  with  the  scope  of  nursing  practice.    IAW  The  Joint  Commission  and  AAAHC standards, the CN and the 4N FM are responsible for ensuring the competence of all nursing staff members is assessed, maintained, demonstrated, and improved. 5.2.1.  To  meet  The  Joint  Commission  and  AAAHC  intent  for  a  periodic  competency assessment, the CN and 4N FM should ensure that:  (T-0). 5.2.1.1.  IAW AFI 44-119 (section 8A), there is a job description, performance standards, a  complete  job  specific  orientation,  and  a  tracking  system  is  in  place  to  ensure competency assessments are conducted on schedule. 5.2.1.2.  Nursing  Services  competencies  will  be  reported  semi-annually  (annually  for ARC) to  the Nurse Executive Function  (EMC for ANG). The report will be defined by the SGN/4N FN and may include but not limited to relevant patterns and training needs and competence maintenance activities. 5.2.2.  Enlisted Nursing Personnel.  Competency requirements for aerospace medical service technicians  and surgical  service technicians are outlined in  their respective CFETP,  Part  II, Section F, and Documentation of Training.  Reference AFI 36-2201, Developing, Managing, and  Conducting  Training,  for  use  of  the  CFETP  to  plan,  conduct,  evaluate,  and  document enlisted training.  Core competencies for aerospace medical service technicians are found in the CFETP, Part II. 5.2.3.  Privileged  Advanced  Practice  Registered  Nurses  (P-APRNs).    Skills  assessment  and competency  evaluation  of  P-APRNs  who  are  privileged  providers  is  accomplished  through the credentials and privileging functions described in AFI 44-119.  (T-1).   20  AFI46-101  30 JANUARY 2015 5.2.4.  AF Nursing Services Competency  Assessment Checklists.  The CN, in  collaboration with  other  nursing  leaders,  will  determine  which  competency  assessment  checklists  will  be applied.  For  some  examples  of  standard  basic  clinical  nursing  references  and  systems  used for Nurse Corps competencies, individuals can refer to AFMOA/SGNE or virtual library on the Kx.  (T-2). 5.3.  Readiness  Skills  Verification  (RSV)  Program.  It is the responsibility of the CN and 4N FM  to  ensure  Nursing  Services  personnel  are  clinically  current  and  prepared  to  meet  medical readiness requirements during home station, humanitarian assistance, homeland security/defense, disaster response and global medical operations.  (T-2).  They will coordinate efforts in matching Nursing  Services  personnel  to  UTC  assignments  and  taskings.    (T-2).    All  Nursing  Services personnel  will  comply  with  AFI  41-106,  Unit  Level  Management  of  Medical  Readiness Programs.  (T-1). 5.4.  Operational  Clinical  Skills  Sustainment.  The  direct  care  health  care  system  does  not always provide adequate opportunity for nursing personnel to maintain operational clinical skill currency.    Therefore  multiple  avenues,  such  as  training  affiliation  agreements,  formal  course training,  etc.,  should  be  considered  when  the  member’s  practice  setting  does  not  provide  the opportunities to maintain clinical currency. 5.4.1.  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  and  Air  National  Guard  nurses  and  aerospace  medical service  technicians,  operational  clinical  sustainment  opportunities  exist  in  various  venues.  AFR and ANG will dictate through their respective chains the specific venues to accomplish sustainment  opportunities  available  to  Reservists  and  Guardsmen  during  Unit  Training Assemblies and Annual Tours.  AFR rotations will be coordinated with AFRC SGX. 5.5.  Air  Force  Specialty  Codes  (AFSCs)  and  Special  Experience  Identifiers  (SEIs).  It  is imperative  that  key  AF  organizations  are  able  to  correctly  identify  current  clinical  and administrative capabilities/AFSCs Nursing Services personnel possess (i.e., Air Force Personnel Center, Air Reserve Personnel Center, Air National Guard Bureau, Air Force Reserve Command, and the Air Expeditionary Forces Center). 5.5.1.  To  ensure  maintenance  of  all  mission-relevant  AFSCs,  the  CN,  or  equivalent,  will review  their  NC  officers’  military  and  civilian  credentials,  education,  and  experience  to determine if the officers meet the criteria for the award of additional AFSCs, IAW the on-line Air  Force  Officer  Classification  Directory  (AFOCD).    (T-3).    The  CN  will  identify  the primary,  secondary,  and/or  tertiary  entry  or  fully  qualified  AFSCs  on  an  AF  Form  2096, Classification/On-The-Job  Training  Action,  and  forward the  form  with  supporting documentation  to  the  appropriate  Commander’s  Support  Staff  (CSS)/Military  Personnel Flight for processing.  (T-3). 5.5.1.1.  For  officers  possessing  more  AFSCs  than  the  Single  Unit  Retrieval  Formal (SURF) can accommodate, the 46N3E (Critical Care Nurse), 46N3J (ED/Trauma Nurse), and  46F3  (Flight  Nurse)  will  have  priority.    The  46F3  will  only  be  the  primary  AFSC while  the  NC  officer  holds  a  46F3  authorization  while  on  active  flying  status.    CNs should  contact  AFMOA  or  MAJCOM  nurses  for  further  guidance  on  AFSC prioritization. AFI46-101  30 JANUARY 2015   21  5.5.1.2.  To improve force management, the primary AFSC will be determined based on selected  criteria  outlined  in  AFI  36-2101,  Classifying  Military  Personnel  (Officer  and Enlisted).  (T-3) 5.5.1.2.1.  46AX and 46FX AFSCs will only be used as a duty AFSC or awarded as a secondary  or  tertiary  AFSC  and  not  as  a  primary  AFSC  (except  as  noted  in  5.5.1.1 above and 5.5.1.2.3 below).  (T-3). 5.5.1.2.2.  Air National  Guard Nurse Corps officer’s duty AFSC, including prefixes, suffixes,  and  skill  levels,  must  match  the  authorized  unit  manpower  document position.  (T-2). 5.5.1.2.3.  Air Force Reserve Command Nurse Corps officers are authorized 46FX as a primary AFSC only when assigned to a 46F UMD position. 5.5.1.3.  Only  Nurse  Corps  officers  who  meet  the  following  mandatory  criteria  will  be awarded the 46A3 as a secondary or tertiary AFSC: 5.5.1.3.1.  Minimum  of  12  months  experience  as  a  CN,  squadron  commander  or group commander. 5.5.1.3.2.  Completion of the Air Force Medical Service Intermediate Executive Skills (IES)  course.    (IES  can  be  waived  for  AFR  Nurse  Corps  Officers  by  AFRC  IES Waiver requests to AFRC/SGN). IES attendance is encouraged but not mandatory for ANG CNs. 5.5.2.  To ensure maintenance of all mission-relevant SEIs, 4N FMs will ensure all assigned enlisted personnel have the correct SEI listed in the Military Personnel Data System.  (T-3). 5.6.  Award  of  46YX  for  Non-AF  sponsored  APNs.  Use  the  following  process  for  Non-AF sponsored APNs or clinical nurses who have achieved an advanced academic degree and want to be considered for privileging and utilization in an APN billet (applies to AD APNs only). 5.6.1.  The requesting nurse will submit an application including a letter of recommendation from the MTF CN, interview and recommendation by the AF/SG consultant for the specialty, and proof of licensure and certification as an APN to AFPC/DPAMN.  (T-3). 5.6.1.1.  AFPC/DPAMN  will  forward Development Team (DT) for review.  (T-3). the  application to the  AF  Nurse  Corps 5.6.2.  The DT will review the application to determine if the nurse meets the criteria for the award of 46YX and may award the 46YX if one of the following conditions can be met: (T-3). 5.6.2.1.  A valid billet exists for the specialty 46YX at nurses’ current duty location. 5.6.2.2.  A  valid  billet  exists  for  the  specialty  46YX  in  another  duty  location  and  the nurse is eligible to move. 5.6.3.  The  Nurse  Corps  officer  may  only  practice  in  the  APN  role  if  they  are  filling  an authorized billet in  one of the advanced practice specialties for the  AFSC.  P-APNs cannot practice  if  they  are  not  in  a  P-APN  billet.    An  exception  applies  to  those  who  have  been awarded  and  practiced  in  an  authorized  P-APN  billet  and  need  to  maintain  currency  while assigned to a non-clinical position (e.g. Commander, Chief Nurse, Staff position).  (T-1).   22  AFI46-101  30 JANUARY 2015 Chapter 6 NURSING STAFFING NEEDS IN ACTIVE DUTY MTFS 6.1.  Medical  Annual  Planning  and  Programming/Resourcing.  The  planning,  programming and  resourcing  process  defines  the  number  and  type  of  personnel  required  to  fulfill  the organization’s mission.  The CN and 4N FM are required to participate in the development and execution  of  the  current  year  Business  Plan,  next-year  Financial  Plan  and  Program  Objective Memorandum (POM) distribution plan for the out years.  The CN and 4N FM will review results of resourcing tools to ensure the appropriate placement and grading of manpower to provide safe patient care.  (T-2). 6.2.  Nurse Assignments and Staffing. 6.2.1.  The CN will coordinate nursing assignment actions for 46XX personnel with squadron and flight commanders, and for 4NXXX personnel with the squadron and flight commanders and the MTF 4N Functional Manager.  (T-2). 6.2.2.  Facility staffing priorities will be based on greatest needs to sustain both inpatient and outpatient missions and needs of the Air Force.  ICUs, inpatient medical/surgical units, ORs, EDs and PACUs provide robust UTC clinical training opportunities and should be considered priority clinical platforms for currency sustainment. 6.2.2.1.  Nurse  Utilization  Officers  at  AFPC  in  coordination  with  the  MTF  SGN  will ensure  staffing  fill  rates  are  based  on  currency  sustainment  and  needs  of  the  Air  Force.  AFPC will ensure highest priority areas are filled at levels equal to or above the staffing rate of lower priority areas. 6.2.2.2.  The  CN  will  make  every  effort  to  execute  local  staffing  assignments  to  ensure highest  priority  areas  are  filled  at  levels  equal  to  or  above  the  staffing  rate  of  lower priority areas. 6.2.3.  In  collaboration  with  the  executive  team,  the  CN  coordinates  Nursing  Services personnel assignments to readiness (UTCs, deployment bands) and disaster teams.  (T-2). 6.3.  Staffing  Effectiveness.  Standards  require  the  availability  of  an  adequate  number  of competent staff to provide nursing care.  Each MTF must have a process or mechanism in place to  monitor  nursing  workload  and  procedure(s)  to  adjust  staffing  in  response  to  workload fluctuation.    As  a  minimum,  the  ANA  recommends  the  following  factors  be  considered  in determining  nursing  staffing  requirements:    patient  volume,  levels  of  intensity  of  patients  for whom  care  is  being  provided,  contextual  issues  including  architecture  and  geography  of  the environment  and  available  technology,  and  level  of  preparation  and  experience  of  those providing care.  Increased nursing workload could require use of on-call staff, contract staffing, or the diversion of patients to other units/agencies for care.  (T-0). AFI46-101  30 JANUARY 2015   23  Chapter 7 DOCUMENTATION OF NURSING CARE 7.1.  Documenting  Nursing  Care.  The  CN  is  responsible  for  ensuring  guidelines  are  in  place for  documenting  direct  nursing  care  and  other  patient  encounters  such  as  telephone  contacts.  The guidelines must be consistent with documentation standards.  At a minimum, documentation should  include:  patient  assessment,  direct/indirect  care  provided,  patient  response  to  that  care, and  patient/family  education  and  their  understanding  of  the  information  provided.    Additional guidelines  on  administration  of  medical  records  can  be  found  in  AFI  41-210,  Patient Administration Functions.  (T-0). 7.1.1.  In-Patient  Documentation.  Nursing  staff  will  comply  with  the  use  of  approved  and established  Electronic  Health  Records,  such  as  ESSENTRIS,  when  available.    The documentation process used will be approved by the CN and the Nurse Executive Function in each MTF.  (T-1). 7.1.2.  Outpatient  Documentation.    Electronic  documentation  in  CHCS/eHR  is  required.  Face-to-face  and  telephonic  encounters  will  be  entered  and  coded  IAW  current  coding guidelines.    (T-1).    Use  of  computer-based  templates,  questionnaires  and  eHR  COMPASS AIM forms are encouraged. 7.1.3.  When  electronic  documentation  is  not  possible,  then  nursing  documentation  will  be accomplished on paper and will be made in reproducible black or blue-black ink.  (T-0). 7.1.3.1.  Errors will be corrected by lining through the incorrect entry (with blue or black ink only), annotating correct information next to the lined-through data if space permits and  initialing  and  dating  the  corrective  entry  above  the  erroneous  entry.    Do  not  leave lines or blank spaces between entries. (See AFI 41-210, Attachment 4, Correcting Health Records).  (T-1). 7.1.3.2.  Paper overprints, progress notes, forms, consents, flow sheets, etc. must comply with  documentation  guidelines  for  thorough  completion,  be  dated,  and  contain  legible initials, signature, rank and duty title.  (T-1). 7.1.4.  Development  of  forms,  overprints,  consents,  questionnaires,  flow  sheets,  etc.,  or  use of  commercial  documents,  whether  paper  or  electronic,  must  be  IAW  AFI  33-360  and coordinated  with  the  Chief  Nurse  and  in  AD  MTFs  with  the  Chief,  Medical  Staff  and approved by ECOMS and the Medical Records function.  In RMUs and GMUs, coordination will be made with the CN and senior physician, and approved by the Executive Management Committee.  (T-1). 7.1.5.  Forms  utilized  by  the  organization’s  documentation  system  are  maintained  as  a permanent  part  of  the  patient’s  health  record  with  the  exception  of  AF  Form  3259,  Work Activity Sheet. 7.1.6.  Aeromedical  Evacuation  Documentation.    Aeromedical  Evacuation  documentation will be accomplished IAW AFI 41-307, Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Considerations and Standards of Care.  (T-1).   24  AFI46-101  30 JANUARY 2015 7.2.  Verbal  Orders.  Verbal  orders  must  be  signed  by  the  prescribing  provider  prior  to  the patient’s release from an ambulatory care setting, or within 24 hours if the patient is hospitalized. The  individual  giving  the  order  verifies  the  complete  order  by  having  the  nurse  receiving  the information first record the information, and then “read-back” the complete order.  (T-0). 7.2.1.  Registered  Nurses  may  accept  verbal  orders  only  in  cases  of  emergency,  IAW National Patient Safety Goal guidance. 7.2.2.  Independent  Duty Medical  Technicians (IDMT) may  accept  verbal  orders  from  their preceptors  IAW  AFI  44-103  and  IAW  National  Patient  Safety  Goal  guidance.  Documentation  must  be  accomplished  on  the  patient  care  form  and  counter  signed  by  their preceptor  within  72  hours.  The  individual  giving  the  order  verifies  the  complete  order  by having  the  IDMT  receiving  the  information  first  record  the  information,  and  then  “read-back” the complete order.  (T-1). 7.3.  Telephone  Orders.  Registered  Nurses  may  accept  telephone  orders  when  providers  are geographically  separated  from  the  unit.    Telephone  orders  must  be  transcribed  and  then  read back to the provider, IAW National Patient Safety Goal guidance.  (T-0).  The individual giving the order verifies the complete order by having the nurse receiving the information  first  record the information and then “read-back” the complete order.  The entire order must be annotated as Read  Back  (RB)  and  verified  with  the  provider  prior  to  the  nurse  signing  the  order  and proceeding.   (T-0).  Telephone orders must be signed by the  provider  as soon as possible after the provider arrives to the unit.  (T-0).  THOMAS W.
