This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources,  and  minimum  core  task  requirements  for  this  specialty.    The  CFETP  will  provide personnel a clear career path to success and will educate Airmen in all aspects of career field training.  The  use  of  the  name  or  mark  of  any  specific  manufacturer,  commercial  product, commodity, or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force.  This CFETP  was  constructed  IAW  AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force  Training  Program,  Atch  2.  NOTE:  Department of Defense (DoD) civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training.    2.  The CFETP consists of two parts.  Supervisors plan, manage and control training within the specialty using both parts of the plan.  2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains  how  everyone  will  use  the  plan.    Section  B  identifies  career  field  progression information,  duties  and  responsibilities,  training  strategies  and  career  field  path.    Section  C associates  each  level  with  specialty  qualifications  (i.e.  knowledge,  education,  experience, training and other).  Section D indicates resource constraints (i.e. funds, manpower, equipment, facilities).  Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.  2.2.  Part II includes the following:  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS), and includes: duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course and core task and correspondence course requirements.    Section  B  contains  the  course  objective  list  and  training  standards  which supervisors will use to determine if airmen satisfied training requirements.  Section C identifies available support materials.  Section D identifies a training course index supervisors may use to determine resources available to support training; included here are both mandatory and optional courses.    Section  E  identifies  MAJCOM  unique  training  requirements  supervisors  can  use  to determine  additional  training  required  for  the  associated  qualification  needs.    At  unit  level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  3.    Using  guidance  provided  in  the  CFETP  will  ensure  individuals  in  this  specialty  receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career.  This plan will enable us to train today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs.

This CFETP provides the information necessary for AFCFM, MFM, commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the training that individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one  of  the  technical  training  centers.    Upgrade  training  identifies  the  mandatory  courses,  task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-,  5-,  7-,  9-skill  level.    Qualification  training  is  actual  hands-on  task  performance  training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected  Airmen.    Proficiency  training  is  additional  training  provided  to  personnel  to  increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.   Some purposes of the CFETP are:  1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field-training program.    Also,  it  is  used  to  help  supervisors  identify  training  at  the  appropriate  point  in  an individual’s career.  1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.  1.3.    Lists  training  courses  available  in  the  specialty,  identifies  sources  of  training  and  the training delivery method.  1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training process.  2.  Uses.  This plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.  2.1.    AETC  training  personnel  will  develop  or  revise  formal  resident,  nonresident,  field  and exportable training, based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of  the  CFETP.    They  will  also  work  with  the  AFCFM  to  develop  acquisition  strategies  for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.  2.2.    MFMs  will  ensure  their  training  programs  complement  the  CFETP  mandatory  initial, upgrade  and  proficiency  requirements.    OJT,  resident  training,  and  contract  training  or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into the plan.   13  2.3.    All  1C1  AFS  personnel,  to  include  GS-2152  and  13M  personnel,  will  complete  the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority and will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy.  MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.  Section B - Career Progression and Information  4.  Specialty Description from the AFECD.    4.1.  Specialty Summary.

This  section  identifies  known  resource  constraints  that  preclude  optimal  anddesired  training  from  being  developed  or  conducted,  including  information  such  as  cost  and manpower.    Narrative  explanations  of  each  resource  constraint  and  an  impact  statement describing what effect each constraint has on training are included.  Also included in this section are  actions  required,  office  of  primary  responsibility  and  target  completion  dates.    Resource constraints will be, as a minimum, reviewed and updated annually. 10.1.  There are currently no constraints on apprentice, journeyman, or craftsman level training. Section E - Transitional Training Guide 11. There are currently no transitional training requirements.  This area is reserved. 26 PART II Section A Air Traffic Control STS Implementation.  This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for the 3-1.skill level ATC apprentice course beginning 20170424 and graduating 20170801. 2. Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201 and AFI 13-204v3, this STS provides information onthe  tasks  necessary  for  Airmen  to  perform  duties  in  the  3-skill  level.    STS  includes  training standards,  specialty/general  core  tasks  and  technical  references  to  conduct  training.    The  STS identifies  those  common  core  knowledge/performance  tasks  required  to  obtain  position certification/facility ratings. 2.1.  Information in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) identifies common ATC tasks, knowledge and technical references (TR). 2.2.  An asterisk (*) in column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies specialty-wide training requirements. 2.3.  Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Task certification,  as  a  minimum,  must  show  Training  Start  Date  (TSD)  (if  applicable),  Training Completion Date (TCD), Trainee and Trainer Initials. 2.4.  Column 4 shows formal training and the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by 3-skill  level  individuals.    Proficiency  format  coding  system  indicates  the  level  of  training  and knowledge provided by the resident training courses.  This coding system represents the contract between the AFCFM and the course providers.      3. Promotion Tests.  The STS also serves as a guide for development of promotion tests used inthe  WAPS.    Specialty  Knowledge  Tests  (SKTs)  are  developed  at  the  USAF  Occupational Measurement  Squadron  by  Senior  NCOs  with  extensive  practical  experience  in  their  career fields.    The  test  samples  subject  matter  areas  judged  by  test  development  members  as  most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air Reserve Component. 4. Recommendations.  Comments and recommendations are invited concerning the quality ofAETC  training.    A  Customer  Service  Information  Line  (CSIL)  has  been  installed  for  use  by supervisory  personnel.      The  purpose  of  this  line  is  to  report  STS  training  deficiencies  (i.e. trained incorrectly or not trained at all) not the Airmen's lack of knowledge retention.   For a quick response to concerns, call CSIL at DSN 597-4566 or Comm 228-377-4566, or fax DSN 597-3790, or e-mail at, 81trg-tget@keesler.af.mil. Reference this STS and identify the specific area of concern (paragraph, training standard element, etc).  27 5. STS DOCUMENTATION:  Document STS in accordance with AFI 36-2201 and AFI 13-204v3.  Operating initials may not be used to sign any documents contained within the AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder. 5.1.    Appointed  trainers  document  the  “trainer”  column  of  the  STS  when  individuals  meet  or exceed the applicable standard.   NOTE:  The ATC career field meets the “third-party certification” requirement allowing trainers to  certify  trainees  on  task  qualification.    This  is  due  to  the  NSE/TSN  position  fulfilling  the quality control check requirement. 5.2.    QUALIFICATION  STANDARD/CERTIFICATION  PROCEDURES:    Train  and  qualify personnel to the “Go” standard established in the appropriate certification guide.  “Go” means that  the  individual  can  perform  the  task  without  assistance  and  meets  proficiency  standards identified in Note 4 of the proficiency code key and local requirements for accuracy, timeliness and correct use of procedures.  The NSE must evaluate each task to the “Go” standard for each control  and/or  duty  position  prior  to  certification.    Document  all  control  and  duty  position certifications on AF IMT 3622, Air Traffic Control/Weather Certification and Rating Record. 5.3.    SUPPLEMENTS:    MAJCOM  and  units  may  supplement  this  STS  to  add  command  and local  requirements.    Those  tasks  must  be  documented  on  AF  IMT  797,  Job  Qualification Standard/Continuation/Command  JQS  and  included  in  the  associated  certification  guide according to AFI 13-204v3. 5.4.    PRINTING  INSTRUCTION:    In  an  effort  to  reduce  local  CFETP  printing  costs,  the following options are authorized:  Keep at least one copy of the entire CFETP (part I and II) in each  ATC  facility  for  general  access  and  master  training  plan  development.    CCTLR  may authorize  placing  only  Part  II;  Section  A  of  the  CFETP,  with  the  cover  and  ID  page,  in individual’s AF Form 623.   5.5.    TECHNICAL  REFERENCE  (TR):    The  NATCT  must  identify  all  TR(s)  for  each knowledge/task contained in this STS and AF IMT 797.  Enter all TR(s) into one master task and technical reference (MTTR) and each associated certification guide.  The NATCT must maintain a copy of this CFETP in the Master Training Plan according to AFI 13-204v3. BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE OFFICIAL Attachments: 1.
