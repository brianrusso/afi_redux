The 4WD System.  A vehicle equipped with 4WD has the ability to use all four wheels to  power  itself.    This  increases  traction  which  may  enable  the  vehicle  to  safely  drive  over terrain and road conditions that a conventional two-wheel drive vehicle cannot.  Figure 5.1.  The 4WD System.    5.2.4.1.  Power is supplied to all four wheels through a transfer case or power transfer unit.  4WD vehicles allow the operator to select different drive modes as necessary.  5.2.4.2.  Refer  to  the  manufacturer’s  operator’s  manual  for  information  on  shifting procedures and maintenance.  5.2.4.3.  On some 4WD models, the initial shift from two-wheel drive to 4WD while the vehicle is moving can cause a momentary clunk and ratcheting sound.  These sounds are normal as the front drivetrain comes up to speed and is not cause for concern.  5.3. Vehicle Inspection.  5.3.1.  Types of Vehicle Inspection.  Note:  If discrepancies are found they must be reported to the Vehicle Control Officer/Vehicle Control Non Commissioned Officer (VCO/VCNCO), the supervisor, and/or vehicle maintenance.  5.3.1.1.

After  changing  the  tire,  return  the  jack  and  lug  wrench  to  the  location recommended by the manufacturer (keep them from becoming flying projectiles and makes them available for future tire changes).  5.5.2.13.   Secure the damaged tire and once it is repaired, return the spare tire back to its proper location.  5.5.3.  Foreign Object Damage (FOD).  5.5.3.1.  Vehicle operators will remove FOD from tires during daily the vehicle inspection.  Before entering the airfield, a physical check for loose/unsecured objects and an inspection of the tire treads for FOD will be accomplished, with the exception of emergency vehicles responding to actual situations.  5.5.3.2.  Any vehicle which has been driven on an unpaved surface will have a tire FOD inspection accomplished prior to re-entering the airfield area.  Vehicles that frequent the flight line will be equipped with a FOD picker and a covered FOD container.  5.5.3.3.  FOD picker will be etched with the vehicle number painted on.  5.5.3.4.  FOD  containers  will  be  identified  with  the  letters  "FOD"  and  will  be  emptied daily.  5.5.3.5.  FOD checks are performed so that aircraft damage can be kept at a minimum.  5.6. High Rollover Risk.  5.6.1.  Rollover facts:  5.6.1.1.  According  to  the  United  States  Department  of  Transportation  (DoT),  traffic crashes  are  recognized  as  a  major  cause  of  death  in  the  United  States,  claiming approximately 42,000 lives annually.  5.6.1.2.  Some 41,821 traffic crash fatalities occurred in 2000, with occupants of passenger vehicles (passenger cars and light trucks) accounting for 31,910, about 76 percent of the total.  Rollover crashes are a significant and growing contributor to this statistic.  A rollover crash is particularly violent in nature.  5.6.1.3.  Unrestrained occupants of a vehicle that rolls are subjected to a variety of forces and  impacts  that  can  result  in  severe  injuries  or  death.    In  2000,  rollover  crashes  killed nearly 10,000 occupants, almost one-third of the total deaths of occupants of these types of vehicles.  5.6.1.4.  All  operators  are  expected  to  observe  posted  speed  limits,  use  proper  load distribution,  check  tire  tread/inflation,  and  abstain  from  alcohol  use  while  operating  all vehicles.  5.6.1.5.  Vehicles with high gross weight/high center of balance such as; passenger vans, 28/44 passenger buses, wreckers, and 7 ½ ton tractors and higher, are at especially high risk of a vehicle rollover accident.  5.6.2.  Rollover prevention:  5.6.2.1.  Always use proper engine speed and gear ratio.  5.6.2.2.  Never exceed load or passenger limit.  5.6.2.3.  One person per seatbelt.  5.6.2.4.  Avoid excessive speed on curves.  5.6.2.5.  Adjust the driving to meet road and weather conditions.  5.6.2.6.  Always inspect the vehicle before-, during- and after-operation.  5.6.2.7.  Ensure all tires are properly inflated and in good operating condition.  5.6.2.8.  Avoid lateral shifts that can create a higher risk of rollovers.  Lane changes should be smooth with clearance ahead of the vehicle and behind the vehicle.  5.7. Vehicle Operation.  5.7.1.  Steering.  5.7.1.1.  Keep proper hand positions on the steering wheel.  5.7.1.2.  A more than normal turn may be necessary due to the length of the vehicle.  5.7.2.  Turning.  5.7.2.1.  Check traffic to the front, rear, and sides.  5.7.2.2.  Check all mirrors, especially on the side next to the lane the vehicle is moving into.  5.7.2.3.  Check  blind  spots.    Turn  the  head  to  check  for  blind  spots  for  vehicles  or pedestrians.  Passenger vans sit up higher than most sedans.    5.7.3.  Braking.  5.7.3.1.  Normal  stopping  is  affected  by:    Speed,  reaction  time,  inclement  weather, condition of tires and brakes, type and condition of road surface and the weight of the van.  5.7.4.  Backing.  5.7.4.1.  Use a spotter.  The operator must keep visual contact with the spotter at all times.  If visual contact is lost, the operator must immediately stop the vehicle.  5.7.4.2.  Check clearance, traffic movement, and surroundings.  5.7.4.3.  Sound horn to ensure spotter is in position and use mirrors while backing.  5.7.4.4.  Back slowly.  5.7.4.5.  See  AFMAN  24-306  for  additional  spotter  safety  guidance  and  standard  AF spotter hand signals.  5.7.5.  Transporting passengers.  5.7.5.1.  Ensure the van is in safe working condition.  5.7.5.2.  Exact number of serviceable seatbelts for passengers.  5.7.5.3.  Allow for curbside loading.  5.7.5.4.  Unload passengers with caution (on curbside, if possible).  Use hazard lights.  Section 6—EXPLANATION AND DEMONSTRATION  6.1. Instructor’s Preparation.  6.1.1.
