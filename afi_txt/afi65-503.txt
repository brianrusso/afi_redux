BY ORDER OF THE  SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE  AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 65-503 Incorporating Change 1, 23 February 2017 4 FEBRUARY 1994 Financial Management US AIR FORCE COST AND PLANNING FACTORS    COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY ACCESSIBILITY:   This publication is available for downloading or ordering on the e-publishing website at: www.e-publishing.af.mil. RELEASABILITY:  There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.  OPR:  SAF/FMCE  Supersedes:  AFR 173-13, 31 October 1989  Certified by: SAF/FMC  (Ms. Pamela C. Schwenke) Pages: 10 This  instruction  implements  AFPD  65-5,  Cost  and  Economics.  It  contains  official  USAF  cost and  planning  factors  that  Air  Force  activities  use  to  estimate  resource  requirements  and  costs associated  with  Air  Force  force  structures,  missions,  and  activities.  The  instruction  addresses operating  and  support  (O&S)  cost  estimates  for  Air  Force  weapon  systems,  primarily  aircraft. The factors, which reflect  Air Force and  command-unique actual or projected operations costs, are  for  general  estimates.  Replace  or  combine  them  with  more  specific  programming, operational, or activity data when it is available. SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  interim  change  applies  the  following  revisions:  (1)  Adds  Table  A60-1:  Military  Annual Standard Composite Pay Tool under section 4.1; and (2)  Adds Table A61-1: Man-Day Support Cost  Estimating  Tool  under  section  4.1.  Also,  OPRs  are  added  under  section  A2.2.  for  each additional table change.   2 AFI65-503  4 FEBRUARY 1994 Section A—Functional Area Responsibilities 1.  Related Publications.  See Attachment 1. 2.  Office of the Secretary of the Air Force: 2.1.  SAF/FMC.  The  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (Cost  and  Economics) oversees  the  Cost  and  Planning  Factor  Program  for  the  Air  Force,  including  logistics, personnel, programming, inflation, and attrition factors. 2.2.  SAF/FMCCF.  Cost  Factors  Division  personnel  develop  logistics  cost  factors,  issue guidance  for  the  development  of  other  factors,  and  validate  factors  prior  to  publication. Changes  are  published  as  required  (when  new  information  is  available),  but  not  less  than once  a  year.  Factors  and  detailed  explanatory  notes  are  available  electronically  on  the Financial  Management  Analysis  Bulletin  Board.  If  you  develop  cost  estimates  or  need  to build  your  own  cost  factors  follow  the  instructions  in  the  tables  on  the  bulletin  board.  For information on accessing the bulletin board, call DSN 286-5850 or (703) 746-5850. 2.3.  Offices of Primary Responsibilities. Attachment 2 lists several other units that develop cost and planning factors. 2.4.  HQ  USAF,  Major  Commands  (MAJCOM),  Field  Operating  Agencies  (FOA),  and Direct  Reporting  Units  (DRU)  Implement  Cost  and  Planning  Factor  Policy.  These organizations may publish unique factors as supplements to this instruction. One copy of any supplement should be sent to SAF/ FMCCF. 2.5.  Air  Force  Cost  Analysis  Improvement  Group  (AFCAIG).  The  AFCAIG  approves logistics cost factors for use by US Air Force units. Section B—General Information 3.  Operating  and  Support  (O&S)  Costs.  This  instruction  presents  cost  and  planning  factors primarily  used  to  develop  and  estimate  O&S  costs  or  resources  needed  for  Air  Force  weapon systems.  The  O&S  cost  category  is  a  major  part  of  the  Life-Cycle  Cost  (LCC)  of  a  weapon system.  Develop  O&S  cost  estimates  by  accumulating  personnel  and  material  costs,  both  of  a direct  and  indirect  nature,  which  the  Air  Force  incurs  while  operating,  maintaining,  and supporting  the  hardware  and  software  of  a  weapon  system.  Use  cost  factors  to  predict  the resources needed by a weapon system for a budget year, or for a weapon system’s economic life. 3.1.  Use of Factors. The five types of cost and planning factors can be used in a variety of studies  or  analyses;  they  are  generally  used  for  budget  year  or  LCC  purposes.  Current  Air Force  policy  is  to  use  budget  year  factors  over  the  estimated  life  of  the  program,  with  the exception of Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) as described below. 3.2.  Budget  Year  Factors.  Use  Factors**.exe  file  on  the  Financial  Management  Analysis Bulletin  Board  to  get  Budget  Year  logistics  factors  in  developing  the  Air  Force  budget submission for a given fiscal year for the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).   AFI65-503  4 FEBRUARY 1994 3 3.3.  LCC Factors. O&S LCC factors attempt to account for the flow of costs throughout the economic life of a system. Life-cycle factors represent the cumulative average of actual prior year  data,  from  initial  operation  through  an  average  economic  life,  projected  out  to  some future budget year. LCC factors are available for Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) aircraft only due to the wide fluctuations in CLS costs over the life of these weapon systems. Section C—Cost and Planning Factors 4.  Logistics  Factors.  Use  variable  logistics  cost  factors  for  programming  and  budgeting  to increase  and  decrease  baseline  programs  when  the  force  structure  changes.  Fixed  and  variable factors build Program Objective Memorandums (POM) and Budget Estimate Submissions at HQ USAF. Use the detailed instructions in each table to build your changes or estimates.

Personnel  Factors.  Use  these  factors  for  cost  studies,  economic  analyses,  component cost  analyses,  Military  Construction  Projects  (MCP),  POM  process,  Fast-Payback  Capital Investment  Program  (FASCAP),  A-76  studies,  as  well  as  programming,  budgeting, accounting,  and  recording  payments  from  other  government  agencies.

Programming  Factors.  Use  Programming  factors  when  you  need  to  identify  the manpower compositions of various aircraft for costing purposes. Detailed instructions on the use of these factors are included in these tables: Table A36-1 A37-1  A38-1  A39-1  A40-1  A41-1   Table A42-1  A43-1  A44-1  A44-2  (A44-1 continued) Descriptive Title Authorized Aircrew Composition - Active  Authorized Aircrew Composition - Guard  Authorized Aircrew Composition - Reserve  Aircraft/Missile factors - Active  Aircraft Program Factors - Guard  Aircraft Program Factors - Reserve   Descriptive Title Typical Aircraft Squadron Strengths - Active  Typical Aircraft Squadron Strengths - Guard  Typical Aircraft Squadron Strengths - Reserve  Typical Aircraft Squadron Strengths - Reserve    4.3.  Inflation  Factors.  Use  the  following  inflation  tables  to  generate  inflation  rates  for  the five  major  categories  of  funds:  Procurement  (PROC);  Military  Construction  (MILCON); Research,  Development,  Test  and  Evaluation  (RDT&E);  Operation  and  Maintenance (O&M);  and  Fuel.  Each  rate  reflects  the  particular  economic  characteristics  of  the corresponding category.

Attrition Factors. Use attrition factors to estimate the number of aircraft remaining after a certain number of years of operation, thus allowing decrements over time in the number of aircraft  being  costed  for  operating  and  support  purposes.  Attrition  factors  are  also  used  to determine initial numbers of aircraft needed to fulfill operational needs. Detailed instructions for using attrition factors are included in these tables: Table A51-1 A52-1 A53-1  Descriptive Title Attrition Data/Estimated Aircraft Losses Air Peace Attrition Loss Flying Hour Levels Average Attrition Rates/USAF/Reserve/Guard  6 AFI65-503  4 FEBRUARY 1994 4.5.  Cost  Models.  The  Cost-Oriented  Resource  Estimating  (CORE)  model  and  the Systematic  Approach  to  Better  Long-Range  Estimating  (SABLE)  model  are  two  primary models  which  use  factors  referenced  in  this  instruction.
