This  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)  is  a  comprehensive  education  and training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements and training support resources  for  the  engineering  specialty.    The  CFETP  will  provide  our  personnel  with  a  clear career path to success and instill rigor in all aspects of our career field training. Note:    Civilian  occupying  associated  positions  may  use  Part  II  as  a  guide  to  support  duty position qualification training.   2. The CFETP consists of two parts used by the supervisor to plan, manage, and control training within the career field. 3. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. 3.1. Section A provides general information about how the CFETP will be used.. 3.2. Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and the career field path. 3.3. Section  C  associates  each  skill-level  with  specialty  qualifications  (knowledge,  education, and training). 3.4. Section D displays resource contraints. 3.5. Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. 4. Part II includes the following: 4.1. Section  A  identifies  the  Specialty  Training  Standard  (STS)  to  include  duties,  tasks,  and technical  references  to  support  Air  Education  and  Training  Command  (AETC)  conducted training, wartime course, and correspondence course requirements. 4.2. Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if an Airman has satisfied training requirements. 4.3. Section C identifies available support materials.   4.4. Section  D  identifies  a  training  course  index  supervisors  can  use  to  determine  resources available  to  support  training.    Included  here  are  both  mandatory  and  optional  courses,  and exportable courseware. 4.5. Section  E  identifies  MAJCOM-unique  training  requirements  supervisors  can  use  to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs. 4.6. Section F identifies home station training references and courses material required for this specialty in support of contingency/wartime training. 5. Using  guidance  provided  in  the  CFETP  will  ensure  individuals  in  this  specialty  receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their careers.  This plan will enable us to train today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs.    Note: At unit level, supervisors and trainers must use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this guide.  4 CFETP 3E5X1, 1 Oct 2015  ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED  Advanced Distributive Learning (ADL).

The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Engineering career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy  must  be  apparent  and  affordable  to  reduce  duplication  of  training  and  eliminate  a disjointed approach to training.  The following decisions were made by a career field Specialty Training Requirements Team (STRT) held 22 Apr – 21 May 2013.  STRT minutes are available on the AF Civil Engineer Force Development Sharepoint https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-EN-CE-A6/24048/default.aspx located in 3E5X1/Administrative/2013STRT/ folder.  B3.1.    Initial  Skills  Training.    The  initial  skill  course  was  reviewed  for  content.    Additions, deletions, and modifications were made to the course.  The War mobilization Plan and wartime training tasks were identified and validated.    B3.2.    Five  Level  Upgrade  Training  Requirements.    Existing  CDCs  were  reviewed  and updated to ensure only current material remained and new technology information was added.  B3.3.  Seven Level Upgrade Training Requirements.  Seven-level training requirements were reviewed and modified.  Existing CDCs were reviewed and updated to ensure they are relevant; however,  due  to  operational  requirements/needs,  existing  7-level  CDC  material  will  now  be introduced at the 5-level in a “B” set.  B3.4.  Proficiency Training.  Any additional knowledge and skill requirements that were not taught  through  initial  skills  or  upgrade  training  are  assigned  as  continuation  training.    The purpose  of  continuation  training  is  to  provide  training  exceeding  minimum  upgrade  training requirements with emphasis on present and future duty positions.  MAJCOMs must develop a continuation-training program that ensures personnel in the Engineering career field receive the necessary training at the appropriate point in their careers.  The training program will identify both mandatory and optional training requirements.   B3.5.    Supplemental  Training.    Subject  Matter  Experts  (SME)  and  the  Training  Committee reviewed supplemental training courses for technical accuracy and identified training that was no longer required or otherwise outdated.  They revalidated the remaining courses as necessary to fully  support  doctrine,  the  War  Mobilization  Plan  (WMP),  the  AF  Enlisted  Classification Directory, and an Airman’s individual career progression in the AFS. B4.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) Academic Programs.  CCAF is one of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions; however, it’s the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military enlisted personnel.  The college is regionally accredited through Air University  by  the  Southern  Association  of  Colleges  and  Schools  Commission  on  Colleges (SACSCOC)  to  award  Associate  of  Applied  Science  (AAS)  degrees  designed  for  specific  Air 15 PART I CFETP 3E5X1, 1 Oct 2015  details can be found website for details Complete AAS degree regarding the following programs.

The  multitude  of  engineers  before  you  established  this expectation through excellent service in both peace and war.  Eligibility criteria for award and wear  of  AF  occupational  badges  can  be  found  in  AFI  36-2923  Aeronautical,  Duty,  and Occupational Badges.   22 CFETP 3E5X1, 1 Oct 2015 PART I MasterBasic  Senior  Civil Engineer Badge Heraldry  Historically,  the  gearwheel  and  compass  represent  the  engineering  profession  in  both  the military  and  civilian  sector.    The  gear  represents  the  essence  of  engineering—applying scientific  principles  and  technology  to  practical  ends.    To  Air  Force  engineers,  the  gear symbolizes  an  element  (representing  the  built  environment)  that  complements  other environments (weapon systems and trained personnel) to enable the Air Force to perform its mission.  The compass is a precision tool used by engineers to design and construct facilities and equipment.  Together, the gear and compass symbolize all the diverse specialties within Air  Force  Civil  Engineer.    Beyond  doubt,  the  wings  helped  to  portray  the  fundamental linkage  between  the  engineering  and  aviation  components—the  built  environment  is  the foundation supporting the Air Force mission and people.  B7.4.  Civil Engineer Occupational Badge Wear Criteria.    B7.4.1.    Basic  Badge.    Awarded  upon  successful  completion  of  the  Engineering  Apprentice Course, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.

Implementation.  This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for the 3-level  Engineering  Apprentice  two  course  pipeline  with  the  Army  ITRO  J9AQA3E531  00RD class beginning 16 November 2015 and graduating on or after 12 February 2016 followed by the AF Unique course JCABP3E531 00AD class beginning 16 February 2016 and graduating on or after 11 March 2016.  A2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS, Air Force Training Program, and in collaboration  with  the  Civil  Engineer,  Air  Force  Career  Field  Manager  (AFCFM),  it  is mandatory for all civil engineers, regardless of duty assignment, to use an automated training record.    The  automated  training  record  currently  being  utilized  to  document  upgrade  and qualification  training  is  an  application  located  on  the  Civil  Engineer  Virtual  Learning  Center (CE-VLC).  A2.1.    Column  1  (Tasks,  Knowledge,  and  Technical  References).    Lists  the  most  common tasks,  knowledge,  and  supporting  technical  references  (TR)  necessary  for  Airmen  to  perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. A2.2.  Column 2 (Core Tasks).  Identifies core tasks (specialty-wide training requirements) by an asterisk (*) in the appropriate skill level sub-column.  As a minimum, trainees must complete hands-on certification on all core, critical and diamond tasks for skill level upgrade.    A2.2.1.  Wartime Tasks.  All tasks in the 3-level course column are considered wartime tasks.  In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a streamlined training environment. A2.2.2.  Diamond  Tasks.    Tasks  identified  by  a  diamond  (♦)  are  considered  contingency/war task  and  are  critical  to  the  career  field.    Equipment  shortfalls  at  most  locations  have  created problems  with  actual  hands-on  certification  of  these  tasks.    In  instances  where  required equipment  is  not  available  for  instruction,  completion  of  the  corresponding  task  Air  Force Qualification Training Package (AFQTP) is all that is required for upgrade/qualification training.  A2.3.  Column 3 (Certification for OJT).  Used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training  requirements.    Use  the  automated  training  record  application  to  document  individual qualifications.    Task  certification  of  core,  critical  and  diamond  tasks  require  a  training completion  date  and  initials  of  the  trainee,  trainer,  and  certifier.    All  non-core  tasks  require training completion date and initials of the trainee and trainer only.  A2.4.    Column  4  (Proficiency  Codes  Used  to  Indicate  Training/Information  Provided).  Indicates formal training and correspondence course requirements.  It shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task, knowledge and the career  knowledge  provided  by  formal  courses,  web-based  training  (WBT)  and  AFQTPs.    See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit education and training manager for current CDC listings.  33 PART II CFETP 3E5X1, 1 Oct 2015  A2.5.  Attachment 1 (Qualitative Requirements).  Contains the proficiency code key used to indicate  the  level  of  training  and  knowledge  provided  by  WBT,  resident  training  and  career development courses. A2.6.  Job Qualification Standard (JQS).  The STS becomes the JQS for OJT when placed in automated  training  application  and  used  according  to  AFI  36-2201.    For  OJT,  the  tasks  in Column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level.  “Go” means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of  procedures  (“Go”  level  equates  to  3c  in  the  STS  proficiency  code  key).    AFQTPs,  when available, shall be used to identify Air Force standardized procedures.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  A2.6.1.  Documentation.  Document and certify completion of training.   A2.6.1.1.  Duty position.  Duty position requirements will be developed and identified by the workcenter supervisor and loaded into the automated training application.  Completion of core, critical and diamond tasks are mandatory for all duty positions.  Ensure the correct duty position title is listed under Profile 1 section of the trainees’ automated training record.    A2.6.1.2.  AFQTP Training and Documentation.  AFQTP or AFQTP assessments have been created  for  all  core  (*)  and  diamond  (♦)  tasks.    Completion  is  mandatory  to  fulfill  task knowledge requirements for upgrade/qualification training.  Each AFQTP provides step-by-step procedures  for  the  trainee,  trainer,  and  certifier  in  completing  each  core  or  diamond  task  and instructions how to document the training in the automated training record. A2.6.1.2.1.  Training.    Documentation  of  the  start  and  completion  of  the  AFQTP  in  the  QTP section located in the automated training record is required for all core and diamond tasks.  The automated training record will not allow you to sign off any tasks in the JQS until the completion date has been entered.  Diamond tasks require the completion of the web-based course (with the review and post-test located in the program) or completion of the AFQTP assessment located on the  CE-VLC  to  determine  if  the  trainee  has  attained  the  knowledge  level  required.    Once  the trainee  has  completed  the  web-based  course  or  AFQTP  assessment,  the  course  completion certificate must be provided to the trainer/supervisor for documentation of the completion in the automated training record and completion of hands-on training, if the equipment is available.  A2.6.1.2.2.  Hands-On Training.  DO NOT sign off the tasks in the JQS until the trainee has completed hands-on/certification training.  For diamond tasks, if the equipment is not available at home station, the completion of the AFQTP or AFQTP assessment is the ONLY requirement for upgrade.  When the equipment becomes available either at home station or at a TDY location, the trainee can be signed off within the JQS section of the automated training record.  34 PART II CFETP 3E5X1, 1 Oct 2015 A2.6.2.  Transcribing  from  previous  versions  to  the  new  CFETP.    Most  items  should transcribe automatically during the update of the new CFETP.  The UTM and supervisor must conduct a review of the new STS to identify any new core, diamond, or non-core tasks and add those tasks to the duty positions.  A2.6.2.1.  Previous  training  certification  not  listed    If  previous  training  certification  is  not listed  in  the  individual  record,  select  the  parent  task  to  be  transcribed,  check  the  task  title(s) block, and click on the transcribe button.  Enter the date of the original certification and sign off the  task(s).    The  trainee  will  then  sign  off  the  task(s)  to  finalize  the  transcription  of  previous training certification.  The automated application will place an entry into the trainee 623a and must be acknowledged by the transcriber and trainee.   A2.6.2.2. Transcribing external training certification.  If a trainee attended a formal training course and received appropriate accreditation, select the 623 III of the user in automated training record and locate the course title in the master catalog, then enter the completion date.  If the course title is not listed, contact the Force Development Manager at AFCEC to have it loaded in the master catalog.  A2.6.3.  Documenting  Career  Knowledge.    When  a  CDC  is  not  available,  the  supervisor identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover all mandatory items specified in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).  For two-time CDC exam failures, the unit commander will take appropriate action IAW AFI 36-2201. Note: Career knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.  A2.6.4. Decertification and Recertification.  When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a parent task, the supervisor shall identify the parent task in the JQS and check the box next to the task  title.    The  supervisor  shall  select  the  Decertify  button  next  to  the  task  and  enter  a  623a comment explaining why the task was decertified, and then enter the Airman into qualification training.  The individual is recertified using the normal certification process.  A2.6.5  Training  Standard.    Tasks  are  trained  and  certified  to  the  “go”  level.  Go  means  the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets the local requirements for accuracy, timeliness,  and  correct  use  of  procedures.    This  equates  to  a  3c  in  the  proficiency  code  key. AFQTPs, when available, shall be used to identify Air Force standardized procedures.  A2.7. Specialty Training Standard.  The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are  developed  at  the  USAF  Airman  Advancement  Division  by  senior  NCOs  with  extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas  judged  by  test  development  team  members  as  most  appropriate  for  promotion  to  higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog.  Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2605, AF Military Testing System.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces.  35 PART II CFETP 3E5X1, 1 Oct 2015 A3.    Recommendations.

Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to identify the tasks, training references, and training sources available in support of contingency/wartime training.  Civil Engineer forces will train to meet  the  full  range  of  tasks  expected  in  the  contingency  environment.    Training  ranges  from knowledge-type training conducted in a classroom, to task-oriented hands-on training conducted in the field.  These training requirements, frequencies, and sources are listed in AFI 10-209, RED HORSE Program and AFI 10-210, Prime Base Emergency Engineer Force (BEEF) Program.   F2.  Home  Station  Training  (HST). HST  is  knowledge-based  and  hands-on  training  that  is conducted  at  the  individual’s  home  station  for  contingency  operations.  The  CE  Commander ensures training is provided and documented and arranges for subject  matter experts to conduct training  as  required.    AFI  10-210,  Attachments  2-6,  identifies  the  personnel  to  be  trained  by specialty and frequencies.  AFI 10-209, Attachments 2-6, identify the personnel to  be trained by specialty and frequencies when assigned to RED HORSE units.  F3.  Combat Skills Training (CST).   CST must  be  institutionalized as  an integral part of any HST program.   Lessons learned from operations such as IRAQI FREEDOM have taught us the importance of maintaining a higher level of combat readiness.  Although the inclusion of combat skills-focused  training  into  HST  does  not  fully prepare  CE  personnel to  work in a  high threat combat  environment,  the  steps  taken to  enhance  training  will help  elevate  units  to  a readiness level  capable  of  supporting  safe  and  effective  operations  in  low  to  medium  risk  combat environments.  F4.  Mission Essential Equipment Training (MEET).    Wartime or contingency environments often involve the use of specialized and unique mission-essential equipment that civil engineers do  not  use  in  their  day-to-day  operations.  Due  to  the  cost  and  complexity,  mission  essential contingency equipment  and  trainer  expertise  are  not  commonly found  at  CONUS  installations.  Personnel must be hands-on certified and the certification documented in their CFETP.  AFI 10- 210, Attachment 4, identifies minimum number of personnel to be trained, positions by specialty, frequencies and Chapter 2 identifies the locations of training sites.  Inadequate training on these key equipment items can negatively impact Air Force contingency operations.  F5.  AF  Expeditionary  (ES)  Training  Requirement.  AETC,  as  lead  MAJCOM  for  AF  ES training,  revamped  ancillary  home-station  and  advanced  (mission  specific)  expeditionary  skills training plans to standardize and synchronize training across the force.   The AF ES training  is described as Tier 2 and Tier 3 training below:  F5.1.  Tier  2:  deployment-ready expeditionary  skills  training.  ES  for  all  Airmen  delivered  at the  wing  level  in  alignment  with  assigned  AEF  band.  Completion  of  this  training  is  a requirement to  maintain  mission-ready  status  to  produce  a  deployment-ready  Airman,  up  to and  including  a  major  combat  operation.  Tier  2  is  designed  to  ensure  every  Airman maintains  ES  proficiency  and  sustains  readiness  currency  for  deployment.  Tier  2  curriculum is  centrally  maintained,  but  executed  at  the  local  level  to  afford  commanders  maximum flexibility.  Tier 2 is divided into two categories;  2A:  ES  proficiency  training  (mostly  CBT), and  2B:  home-station  pre-deployment  training. 42 PART II CFETP 3E5X1, 1 Oct 2015 through the in  appropriate force  generation  process  and  directed  F5.2.  Tier  3:  advanced  ES  training  (mission  specific).    Enhanced  ES  for  selected  Airmen as  determined  by  factors  including  deployment  location,  threat  assessment,  specific  mission, duty  assignment,  role,  operation,  or  special  requirement.    Tier  3  training  provides  mission specific ES  for the individual Airman and/or team and includes courses designed in response to  organic  Air  Force  need  or  combatant  commander-directed  theater-specific  requirements. Airmen  will  attend  Tier  3  training  such  as  combat  Airmen  skills  training  (CAST)  when identified line remarks/reporting instructions.  F6.  Silver Flag Training.  All CE personnel who fill Unit Type Code (UTC) positions will receive  team  training  at  Silver  Flag  Exercise  Sites.    Silver  Flag  Exercise  Sites  are  located  at Tyndall AFB, FL; Ramstein AB, Germany; Joint Region Marianas, Guam and conduct training with  their  major  focus  on  students  being  able  to  perform  critical  contingency  tasks  in  a  team environment.    The  training  focuses  on  bare  base  bed  down  and  sustainment  operations  using hands-on  training  with  BEAR  equipment  in  a  realistic  environment.    Where  possible,  combat skills training has been added to the curriculum to ensure realism and help fortify combat skills mentality amongst teams.  F7. Training References.  F7.1.

Scale Value 1 2 3 4 a b c d A B C D Proficiency Code Key Definition:  The individual Can do simple parts of the task.  Needs to be told or shown how to do most of the task. (Extremely Limited)Can do most parts of the task.  Needs only help on hardest parts.  (Partially Proficient) Can do all parts of the task.  Needs only a spot check of completed work.  (Competent) Can do the complete task quickly and accurately.  Can tell or show others how to do the task. (HighlyProficient)Can name parts, tools, and simple facts about the task.  (Nomenclature) Can determine step by step procedures for doing the task.  (Procedures) Can identify why and when the task must be done and why each step is needed. (Operating Principles)Can predict, isolate, and resolve problems about the task.  (Advanced Theory) Can identify basic facts and terms about the subject.  (Facts) Can identify relationship of basic facts and state general principles about the subject.  (Principles) Can analyze facts and principles and draw conclusions about the subject.  (Analysis) Can evaluate conditions and make proper decisions about the subject.  (Evaluation) Task Performance Levels *Task Knowledge Levels **Subject Knowledge Levels Explanations *  A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task. (Example:  b and 1b) **  A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks. -  This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.  2b/I - This mark is used to identify Interservice Training Review Organization (ITRO) taught tasks.  The U.S. Army is the lead Service for ITRO to the 3E5X1 AFSC.  ITRO complies with AFI 36-2230; however, may not directly correlate to USAF proficiency code structure.  Contact 3E5X1 Force Development Manager (FDM) for comments, questions or concerns. X - This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources. ♦ - This symbol indicates the task is a diamond task due to equipment constraint at some units. Specific tasks not identified with a symbol or proficiency code key (blank) indicates that no training is provided in the course or CDC.   Major commands and /or units may establish scale values and combat training as dictated by mission requirements. Note 1: BLK #4: Columns (1) & (2) can be relabeled to meet Career Field Requirements; i.e., 2 phase 3-skill level course, 5- and 7- level AFQTP Note 2:  All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime. 44 Attachment 2 3E5X1 Specialty Training Standard (STS) CFETP 3E5X1, 1 Oct 2015      A2.

AFQTP & DL Documentation Record.  A3.1.  To ensure each Engineering trainee is trained to the correct standard an AFQTP has been developed for each core (*) and diamond (♦) tasks identified in their STS.  These AFQTPs are mandated to be used by the trainee, trainer, and certifier in their on-the-job-training program for upgrade to the 5- or 7-level.  A3.2.    These  AFQTPs  ensures  all  aspects  of  the  task  is  covered  sufficiently  and  provide additional task knowledge in preparation for hands-on training.  AFQTPs summarize procedures on a task performance checklist for use by trainers, certifiers, and trainees.  A3.2.1.  The UTM or supervisor can download AFQTP's from CE-VLC reference library.  A3.2.2.   In additional to the paper-based AFQTPs there are web-based courses or assessments developed for certain tasks that are available on the CE-VLC under the specialty topic area.  A3.3.  Documentation.  Before a core or diamond task can be signed off in the JQS section of the individual automated training record the task must be signed off in the QTP section first.  A3.3.1.  Core/Diamond Tasks.  To document the completion the supervisor or trainer opens the individual automated training record, navigates to the QTP section, enter the start and completed date with signatures.  A3.3.2.  Diamond  (♦)  Tasks.  Supervisors/Trainers  DO  NOT  sign  off  the  corresponding  JQS task until the trainee has completed hands-on training.  If the required equipment is not available at your location, completion of the task’s AFQTP web-based course or assessment with a passing score  of  80%  is  all  that  required  for  upgrade  training.    Hands-on  certification  shall  be accomplished at the first opportunity when equipment is available and then can be signed off on the JQS.  A3.4.  3E5X1 Core and Diamond Tasks Requirements.
