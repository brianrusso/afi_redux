OPR:   AF/A3OR  Supersedes:   AFI11-101, 1 November 2002 Certified by: AF/A33 (Maj Gen James Post III) Pages: 7   This  instruction  implements  AFPD  11-1,  Flying  Hour  Program.    It  requires  Lead  Major Command  (MAJCOM),  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  and  Air  National  Guard  flying  hour program managers to submit flying hour program reports to AF/A3OR. (AFMC is exempt from the reporting requirements of this AFI).  It explains how to prepare and when to submit reports.  MAJCOMs planning to issue supplements to this instruction submit drafts of the supplement to AF/A30R  for  approval  prior  to  printing  and  distribution.    Ensure  that  all  records  created  as  a result  of  processes  prescribed  in  this  publication  are  maintained  in  accordance  with  Air  Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force  Records  Disposition  Schedule  (RDS)  located  in  the  Air  Force  Records  Information Management  System  (AFRIMS).    Refer  recommended  changes  and  questions  about  this publication  to  the  Office  of  Primary  Responsibility  (OPR)  using  the  AF  Form  847, Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication;  route  AF  Forms  847  from  the  field  through  the appropriate functional chain of command. SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  change  updates  office  symbols  for  AF/A33.    Specific  content  changes  include  frequency change  of  Flying  Hour  Execution  Reports,  modification  to  out  of  cycle  adjustment  guidelines, and modification of the HCM (hours/crew/month) report requirement.  Intent of the change is to update  report  requirements  for  Flying  Hour  information  and  related  internal  controls.    The instruction has been significantly rewritten and must be reviewed in its entirety.   2  AFI11-101  22 JUNE 2015 1.  Flying Hour Mid-Year Review.  Regular Air Force (RegAF) Lead MAJCOMs shall perform a  mid-year  review  and  provide  execution  projections  AF/A3OR  for  the  remainder  of  the  fiscal year  on  or  about  15  April  of  each  year.    Air  Force  Reserve  Command  (AFRC),  Air  National Guard  (ANG),  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Command  (AFSOC)  and  Air  Force  Materiel Command (AFMC) will direct mid-year requirements as deemed necessary for  each respective program. 1.1.  The information submitted by Lead MAJCOM flying hour program managers is used to ensure  the  AF  Flying  Hour  Program  (FHP)  is  executed  in  the  most  effective  and  efficient manner possible without driving additional costs to the AF during execution year.  Additional authorized  customers  may  utilize  flying  hour  data  to  support  a  variety  of  other  USAF programs, with operations, maintenance, sustainment, budgetary, etc. impacts. 1.2.  Regular  Air  Force  (RegAF)  Lead  MAJCOMs  should  realign  their  President’s  Budget (PB) flying hours from one Mission Design Series (MDS) to another on a cost-neutral basis without crossing Budget Activity Codes (BAC).   Crossing BAC constitutes reprogramming action which must have Congressional approval via SAF/FMB.  Under the Centralized Asset Management (CAM) construct, RegAF MAJCOMs no longer manage FHP funding; except, the FHP Government Purchase Card (GPC).  The congressionally approved flying hours for all  Air  Force  operations  is  the  basis  for  developing  support  requirements  and  costs  for  all RegAF Lead MAJCOMs.  Additional requirements must be prioritized and coordinated with AF/A3OR and SAF/FMBOO.  See Attachment 2 for format. 2.  Monthly Flying Hour Execution Report.  This report is used to manage the execution year flying hour program, ensure the program is executed within fiscal constraints. 2.1.  Initial template will be forwarded by AF/A3OR Flying Hour Team to Lead MAJCOMs, AFRC, and ANG before the first month of the new fiscal year with PB funded hours. 2.2.  Submit Monthly Flying Hour Execution Reports no later than the 15th of each month. 2.3.  Send  reports  to  USAF  Pentagon  AF  A3-5  Mailbox  A3OR  Readiness,  Exercises  and Flying  Hours,  usaf.pentagon.af-a3.mbx.a3or-readiness@mail.mil,  AFMC  CAM  group email  AFMC.CAM.FLYHRS@wpafb.af.mil,  and  members  of  the  AF/A3OR  flying  hour team. 2.4.  In the top  section of the spreadsheet,  show  a complete breakout  of the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) flying hours by Program Element Code (PEC) and MDS.  Contingency, Transportation  Working  Capital  Fund  (TWCF),  and  Training,  Test  and  Ferry  (TTF)  hours and all reimbursable hours are to be separated in different areas of the spreadsheet.  A total programs section is to be included. 2.5.  All  data  should  be  rounded  to  the  nearest  tenth  of  an  hour,  in  accordance  with  AFTO Form  781  ARMS  Aircrew/Mission  Flight  Data  Document  conventions.    See  Attachment  3 for format. 2.6.  The CAM office will utilize this report as the basis for monthly reimbursements to the Working Capital Fund (WCF) for Depot Level Reparables (DLRs) and Consumables. 3.  Out-of-Cycle  Program  Adjustments.  Lead  MAJCOMs  submit  Out-of-Cycle  Program adjustment requests during execution year when they desire to adjust their flying hour program. AFI11-101  22 JUNE 2015   3  3.1.  Out-of-Cycle Program adjustment requests can be made when conditions prevent flying the entire flying hour program, a requirement for additional flying hours exists or end-of-year flying  hour  turn-in.    Note:  MAJCOMs  look  initially  within  current  program  to  source additional hours at a zero based cost adjustment. 3.2.  Submit  to  AF/A3OR  Workflow  Inbox.    Requests  include  BAC,  PEC,  MDS,  hourly adjustment, associated costs, and impact statement rationale. 3.3.  AF/A3OR request additional flying hour program end-of-year projections July, August and weekly in the month of September to identify un-executable flying hours. 3.4.  Validate  and  submit  MAJCOM  overfly  projections  at  the  end  of  each  Program Objective  Memorandum  (POM)  cycle  and  PB  submissions  to  AF/A3OR.    AF/A3OR  will provide initial and updated overfly hour projections to HQ AFMC’s AFSC/LGP (Air Force Sustainment  Center  Maintenance  and  Supply  Requirements  Division),  who  will  enter  the validated projections into the D200 Requirements system and to  AFLCMC/LP the Director of Propulsion (DoP), for developing engine requirements.  Projections will also be provided to the Spares Requirements Review Board (SRRB) community for use in developing spares and engine requirements for CAM (RegAF MAJCOMS), ANG, AFRC, AFSOC, and AMC Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF). 4.  Hours/Crew/Month (HCM) Requirement Report.  AF/A3OR will compute and submit an HCM  Requirement  Report  (as  applicable)  biannually  after  completion  of  the  POM  submission and  President’s  Budget  Review  (PBR)  and/or  as  requested  by  Office  of  Secretary  of  Defense Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (OSD-CAPE) Office. 4.1.  A3OR will submit API-1 HCM  requirement in  hours per month for the following CC, CA, and IF coded aircraft (B-1, B-2, B-52, A-10, F-15, F-15E, F-16, F-22, F-35, KC-10, KC-135,  KC-46,  C-5,  C-17,  C-130,  E-3,  E-4,  EC-130,  HH-60,  HC-130  and  UH-1)  based  on programmed hours. A3OR will project HCM requirement for the budget year and the next 5 fiscal years. A3OR will maintain methodology used in determining HCM. 4.2.  Fiscal,  logistical,  or  manpower  limitations  will  not  be  considered  when  computing requirements.    Pass  MAJCOM  HCM  program  data  to  OSD  for  budget  documentation purposes. 5.  Flying Hour Requirement Report.  Lead MAJCOMs will compute and submit Regular Air Force  (RegAF)  flying  hour  requirements  to  AF/A3OR  for  submission  to  SAF/FMBOO  and OSD-CAPE for budget documentation biannually after completion of the POM submission and PBR and/or  as requested by SAF/FMBOO  and OSD-CAPE.  National  Guard  Bureau  for  ANG and AF/RE for AFRC will provide documentation to OSD-CAPE via equivalent component FM communities. 5.1.  Lead MAJCOMs, ANG and AFRC will submit flying hour requirements to A3OR and will  maintain  methodology  used  in  determining  requirements  based  on  AF  Single  Flying Hour  Model  (SFHM).    A3OR  will  maintain  requirements  submissions  from  Lead MAJCOMs, ANG and AFRC. 5.2.  Fiscal,  logistical,  or  manpower  limitations  will  not  be  considered  when  computing requirements.    Pass  MAJCOM  requirement  versus  MAJCOM  program  data  to  OSD  for comparison purposes. 5.3.  During  MINIMIZE,  reports  are  mandatory  (alternate  delivery  methods  may  be  used).  These  reports  are  designated  emergency  status  code  C-2.    Continue  reporting  during emergency conditions, precedence normal. AFI11-101  22 JUNE 2015   4   TOD D.
