Due  to  dynamic  requirements  of Combatant Commanders, training requirements and currencies may be altered regularly.  These  training  requirements  and  currency  adjustments  may  be  made  via  RAP  Tasking Memorandum.  HQ ACC/A3 will include MAJCOM supplemental guidance in the next publication of the AFI. 1.4.  Training.  Training  programs  are  designed  to  progress  pilots  from  Initial  Qualification Training  (IQT)  (B-Course  or  Transition/Requalification  Training  [TX]),  then  to  Mission Qualification Training (MQT), and finally to Continuation Training (CT). 1.4.1.  IQT  provides  the  training  necessary  to  initially  qualify  pilots  in  a  basic  position  and flying  duties  without  regard  to  a  unit's  mission.    Upon  completion  of  IQT,  the  pilots  attain Basic  Aircraft  Qualification  (BAQ)  status.    BAQ  is  a  prerequisite  for  MQT.    Except  for General  Officers  above  wing  level,  BAQ  is  not  a  long  term  qualification  status.    Waiver authority  for  pilots,  other  than  general  officers  above  the  wing  level,  to  remain  BAQ  is MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G) (T-2).   8  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 1.4.2.  MQT  provides  the  training  necessary  to  initially  qualify  or  requalify  pilots  in  a specific position and flying duties to perform the missions assigned to a specific unit.  Pilots maintain  BAQ  status  until  they  complete  MQT.    Completion  of  MQT  or  FTU  instructor course is a prerequisite for BMC and CMR. 1.4.3.  CT.  There  are  two  aspects  of  CT.    The  first  consists  of  pilot  training  in  the  basic flying skills contained in the RAP Tasking Memo (RTM).  These skills ensure safe operation of  the  aircraft.    The  second  consists  of  specific  mission-related  training  required  to accomplish the unit's assigned missions. 1.4.4.  Ready  Aircrew  Program  (RAP).  The CT program is designed to focus training on capabilities  needed  to  accomplish  a  unit's  core  tasked  missions.    Following  completion  of IQT and MQT, pilots will have received training in all the basic missions of a specific unit unless  excepted  in  Chapter  3.    Pilots  will  then  be  assigned  to  either  a  CMR  or  BMC position. 1.4.4.1.  Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR).  The  minimum  training required for pilots  to be qualified and proficient in all of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapons system. 1.4.4.2.  All  CC-coded  unit  Regular  Air  Force  (RegAF)  API-1  positions,  flying  SQ/CC and  DO  positions  are  designated  CMR  positions.    OG/CCs  may  designate  other  API-6 positions  not  assigned  to  the  flying  squadron  as  CMR.    (Exception:  If  a  unit  is  over-manned,  the  SQ/CC  may  elect  to  train  the  front  line  of  their  Unit  Manning  Document (UMD) API-1s to CMR and designate the overage BMC.  In this case, priority should be given  to  inexperienced  pilots  with  at  least  50  percent,  if  available,  designated  CMR).  (ARC/TFI:  Any  pilot  may  be  designated  CMR  at  OG/CC  discretion).    CMR  pilots maintain proficiency and qualification in all core missions of the flying unit to which they are  assigned  or  attached.    CMR  pilots  maintain  currencies  which  affect  CMR  status, accomplish  all  core  designated  flight  training  (missions  and  events),  and  all  mission ground training.  Failure to complete this training or maintain these currencies results in regression to non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived by appropriate authority  (T-3). 1.4.4.3.  Basic Mission Capable (BMC).  Pilot accomplishes training required to remain familiarized in all, and may be qualified and proficient in some, of the primary missions of their weapon system  and unit.  (ARC:  Any pilot  may be designated  BMC at  OG/CC discretion). 1.4.4.4.  All non-CMR RegAF wing pilot positions are designated BMC positions.  BMC designations are assigned to pilots who have a primary job performing wing supervision or  staff  functions  that  directly  support  the  flying  operation,  or  are  FTU  instructors, Weapons  School  instructors,  pilots  assigned  to  active  flying  billets  in  units  without assigned  aircraft (i.e., 549 CTS  [Green Flag-West], etc.), or operational  test pilots.   For those missions in which they maintain familiarization only, BMC pilots must be able to attain  proficiency  and  qualification  in  30  days  or  less.    BMC  pilots  accomplish  all mission  related  ground  training  designated  by  their  attached  SQ/CC.    BMC  pilots  may deploy  and  may  participate  in  any  mission  for  which  they  are  proficient  and  qualified, without  additional  training,  as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC.    Failure  to  complete  BMC required training  results in  regression to  non-BMC (N-BMC) status.   AFRC and AFRC TFI BMC training events will be directed by RAP Tasking Memo. AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   9  1.4.4.5.  BMC  pilots  assigned  to  units  without  assigned  aircraft  (i.e.,  549  CTS  [Green Flag-West],  etc.)  will  fly  a  RAP  mix  as  determined  by  the  unit  commander  consistent with  their unit’s tasking.   RAP  events  and weapon requirements are determined by the unit commander (T-3). 1.4.4.6.  N-CMR/N-BMC.  Pilots that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status will accomplish the  requirements  in  accordance  with  paragraph  4.10  While  N-CMR,  pilots  may participate in missions, including exercise and contingency, in which they are current and qualified at the discretion of the SQ/CC. (T-3). 1.4.4.7.  Specialized  Training.  Specialized  training  is  training  in  any  special  skill(s) necessary  to  carry  out  the  unit's  assigned  missions  that  is  not  required  by  every  pilot.  Specialized  training  consists  of  upgrade  training  such  as  FLUG,  IPUG,  FAC(A), ACA/ONE with  TGP/ATP,  etc., including CT to maintain proficiency and qualification in  unit  tasked  special  capabilities  and  missions.    Specialized  training  is  normally accomplished  after a pilot  is  assigned CMR/BMC status,  and is  normally  in addition  to CMR/BMC requirements.  Unless otherwise specified, pilots in CMR or BMC positions may  hold  special  capabilities/qualifications  as training requirements are accomplished. long  as  any  additional 1.5.  Training Concepts and Policies: 1.5.1.  Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness consistent  with  flight  safety  and  resource  availability.  Training  must  balance  the  need  for realism  against  the  expected  threat,  pilot  capabilities,  and  safety.    (T-3).    This  instruction provides  training  guidelines  and  policies  for  use  with  operational  procedures  specified  in applicable flying/operations publications. 1.5.2.  ACC Training Support Squadron (ACC TRSS) will assist OG/CCs in development of training  programs  when/where  tasked  by  the  HQ  ACC/A3.    Other  MAJCOMs  may  submit requests for training program support to the HQ ACC/A3.  If validated, these requests will be prioritized and tasked to ACC TRSS.  Designated test units (CB-coded) may develop syllabi to  upgrade  operational  test  pilots  in  support  of  specific  test  plans.    These  syllabi  will  be approved by the OG/CC and submitted to ACC TRSS. (T-2). 1.5.3.  Design  training  missions  to  achieve  combat  capability  in  squadron  tasked  roles, maintain  proficiency,  and  enhance  mission  accomplishment  and  safety.    RAP  training missions  will  emphasize  either  basic  combat  skills  or  scenarios  that  reflect  procedures  and operations  based  on  employment  plans,  location,  current  intelligence,  and  opposition capabilities.  Tactical training will include use of inert and  live ordnance, threat simulators, countermeasures, targeting pods, HTS pods and dissimilar aircraft as much as possible.  (T-2). 1.5.4.  In-flight Supervision: 1.5.4.1.  Unless  specifically  directed,  the  SQ/CC  determines  the  level  of  supervision necessary to accomplish the required training (T-3). 1.5.4.2.  IPs  and  FL-qualified  SQ  supervisors  may  allow  any  pilot  to  lead  portions  of  a mission  if  appropriately  briefed.    This  provision  will  only  be  used  to  allow  the  pilot  to   10  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 practice events in which he is already qualified or to help determine if the pilot is ready for FLUG. 1.5.4.3.  Flight  leads  may  give  their  wingman  the  tactical  lead  for  specific  tasks.    As  a tactical  lead,  the  wingman  makes  tactical  decisions  for  the  flight,  but  the  flight  lead retains overall authority and responsibility. 1.5.5.  Experienced Pilot (EXP) 1.5.5.1.  An experienced pilot has one of the following: 1.5.5.1.1.  500 hours F-16, or 1.5.5.1.2.  300 hours F-16 with 1,000 hours (FP/IP/MP), or 1.5.5.1.3.  100 hours F-16 and previously fighter EXPERIENCED. 1.5.5.2.  For  pilots,  fighter  time  is  defined  as  FP/IP/MP  hours  logged  in  aircraft  while assigned an AFSC of 11FX.  T-38A/B (ADAIR) and T-38C (IFF) are considered fighter time. 1.5.5.3.  Hours  logged  in  the  MTC  accomplishing  RAP  Tasking  Memo-approved missions  will  be  counted  as  “hours”  when  determining  experience  level.    RAP  MTC Mission  hours  will  not  exceed  20%  of  the  total  required  to  meet  the  experienced threshold (ex: 100 RAP MTC Mission hours out of 500 hours F-16 time).  See the current RAP  Tasking  Memo  for  guidance  on  approved  RAP  MTC  Missions  and  logging procedures  (T-2).  AFRC: N/A. 1.5.5.4.  WSOs/CSOs must achieve fighter EXPERIENCED while assigned an AFSC of 12F3X or 12F4X. 1.6.  Ready Aircrew Program Policy and Management: 1.6.1.  The  RAP  training  cycle  is  12  months  and  is  aligned  with  the  Fiscal  Year.    RAP tasking executed IAW RAP Tasking Memorandum. 1.6.2.  Each RAP training level (CMR, BMC & BAQ) is defined by a total number of RAP missions,  broken  down  into  simulators,  missions,  specific  weapons  qualifications,  and associated events as determined by the MAJCOM and unit commander. 1.6.3.  The breakout of mission and event types is provided as a guideline to be followed as closely as possible but minor variances (other than increased Red Air allocations for CMR; AFRC: N/A) are authorized.  However, SQ/CCs may still use variations in missions or events as a basis for regression. 1.6.4.  An effective RAP training mission requires accomplishing a tactical or building block profile.  Each mission requires successfully completing a significant  portion of the relevant events as determined by the SQ/CC, RTM, and Attachment 2. 1.6.4.1.  Only  one  RAP  training  mission  may  be  logged  per  sortie  (day  or  night)  unless separated  by  AAR.    Each  mission  on  either  side  of  the  AAR  must  stand  alone  as  an effective  RAP  training  mission.    A  maximum  of  three  RAP  missions  per  sortie  may  be logged under these rules (T-2). AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   11  1.6.5.  The SQ/CC's first priority will be to train all designated pilots to CMR status.  (T-3).  CMR status requires: 1.6.5.1.  A 1-month lookback at the CMR sortie rate (ref paragraph  4.7.1.1 for specifics and further criteria). 1.6.5.2.  Qualification in all core missions and weapons events required at CMR. 1.6.5.3.  Confirmation that CMR pilots can complete the prorated number of sortie/event requirements remaining by the end of the training cycle. 1.6.5.4.  Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification or certification. 1.6.6.  Progression from BMC to CMR requires: 1.6.6.1.  A 1-month lookback at the CMR rate. 1.6.6.2.  Qualification in all core missions and weapons events required at CMR. 1.6.6.3.  Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification or certification. 1.6.6.4.  Squadron CC certification. 1.6.7.  SQ/CCs  will  determine  and  assign  pilots  that  will  train  for  and  maintain  special capabilities  or  qualifications    (T-3).    Special  capability/qualification  mission  and  event requirements  are  normally  accomplished  in  addition  to  baseline  CMR/BMC  requirements except for mission commander and flight lead training. 1.6.8.  End of Cycle training requirements are based on the pilot's experience level on the last day of the current training cycle. 1.6.9.  Units converting to another MDS may fly pilots in CMR positions at the BMC rate if CMR  sortie  rates  cannot  be  supported.    One  month  prior  to  the  operationally  ready  date, CMR  pilots  will  be  flown  at  a  CMR  rate.    RegAF  wings  converting  to  new  MDS  are authorized  one  SQ  equivalent  (7/6  for  24/18  or  less  PAI)  of  additional  API-6s  during  the conversion  period.    However,  total  wing  staff  flying  the  new  aircraft  shall  not  exceed  new authorized total (T-2). 1.7.  Training Sortie Program Development: 1.7.1.  RAP  mission  and  event  requirements  (see  Attachment  2)  apply  to  CMR  and  BMC pilots including those carrying special capabilities or qualifications.  They are IAW the RAP tasking  memo  which  specifies  the  total  RAP  training  cycle  mission  requirements.    RAP Lookback and Mission requirements are published in Tables 5.a. and 5.b. of the current Rap Tasking  Memorandum.    It  establishes  the  minimum  number  of  missions  required  for  BMC and  CMR  levels.    The  RAP  tasking  memo  takes  precedence  over  this  instruction  and  may contain updated requirements and events not yet incorporated in Attachment 2. (T-2). 1.7.2.  Navigation sorties will be programmed for API-1 pilots. (T-3).  These sorties ensure that pilots maintain their skills necessary to operate safely in the civil airspace environment. 1.7.3.  Experiencing  sortie  requirements  must  be  considered  when  developing  unit  flying hour programs. (T-2).   12  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 1.7.3.1.  Experiencing sorties are additional training sorties necessary to  achieve desired proficiency  in  optimum  time.    RAP  missions  may  not  provide  sufficient  hours  to experience pilots to achieve overall unit experience levels. 1.7.3.2.  Collateral sorties are not directly related to combat employment training but are necessary in day to day unit operations.  These include, but are not limited to, functional check  flights,  ferry  flights,  incentive/orientation  flights,  deployments,  and  air  shows.  Additional  hours  are  allocated  for  these  purposes,  based  on  the  current  fiscal environment. 1.7.4.  (Non-effective  sorties  are  allocated  to  unit  flying  hour  programs  to  compensate for  non-effective  training  sorties,  based  on  the  current  fiscal  environment.    Non-effective  sorties  are  logged  when  a  training  sortie  is  planned,  but  a  major  portion  of valid  training  for  that  type  of  mission  is  not  accomplished  due  to  poor  weather,  IFE, adversary fallout, etc.  For CMR and BMC pilots, (N/A AFRC)  non-effective sorties will be  logged  (and  not  counted  toward  RAP  totals)  when  Red  Air  allocations  are  exceeded during  a  training  cycle.    Only  1  AHC  or  Instrument  sortie  may  be  applied  to  monthly lookback  for  any  given  month.    For  example,  if  an  instrument  sortie  is  flown  during  a particlar month, an AHC sortie flown that same month cannot  be counted towards monthly lookback.    It  will  be  logged  as  Excess  AHC.    Excess  Instrument  sorties  will  be  logged  as Excess Instrument in ARMS (T-2). 1.8.  Training Records and Reports. 1.8.1.  Units will maintain pilot records for individual training and evaluations IAW: (T-2). 1.8.1.1.  AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training. 1.8.1.2.  AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program. 1.8.1.3.  AFI 11-401, Aviation Management. 1.8.2.  Units will track the following information for all pilots (as applicable): (T-2). 1.8.2.1.  F-16 specific ground training (not Ancillary Training). 1.8.2.2.  Requirements  and  accomplishment  of cumulatively for the training cycle. individual  missions  and  events 1.8.2.3.  RAP  requirements  and  accomplishment  using  1-month  and  3-month  running totals for look-back. 1.8.2.4.  Currencies. 1.8.2.5.  Weapons employment qualification requirements in sufficient detail to document all employment attempts and hit/miss percentages in a COTS database of choice. 1.8.3.  Units will maintain a training folder for each assigned aircrew to include the following information: (T-2). 1.8.3.1.  Current aircrew qualifications and upgrade training programs. 1.8.3.2.  Letter of qualification from previous unit (if applicable). 1.8.3.3.  Documentation  for  completion  of  any  specialized  training  programs  from  AFI 11-2F-16, Volume 1, while assigned to the unit. AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   13  1.8.4.  Unit  training  folders  will  be  forwarded  to  the  gaining  unit  when  the  aircrew  has  a permanent change of station (T-3). 1.9.  Pilot Utilization Policy: 1.9.1.  Commanders  will  ensure  that  wing/group  tactical  pilots  (API-1/6s)  fill  authorized positions  IAW  unit  manning  documents  and  that  pilot  status  is  properly  designated.    The overall objective is that pilots perform combat-related duties.  Supervisors may assign pilots to  valid,  short-term  tasks  (escort  officer,  FEB/mishap  board  member,  etc.),  but  must continually  weigh  the  factors  involved,  such  as  level  of  pilot  tasking,  flying  proficiency, currency, and experience.  For inexperienced pilots in the first year of their initial operational F-16  assignment,  supervisors  will  limit  the  non-flying  duties  to  those  related  to  combat activities (T-3). 1.9.2.  Duties required by various publications that may be assigned to CAF API-1 pilots are weapons  and  tactics  officer,  programmer,  flight  safety  officer,  SOF,  mobility/contingency plans,  training  (except  ARMS  documentation),  SQ  Standardization/Evaluation  Liaison Officer (SELO), aircrew flight equipment officer, electronic combat officer, and other duties directly  related  to  flying  operations.    In  some  instances,  such  as  squadron-assigned  flying safety  officers,  API-1s  may  be  attached  to  the  wing.    API-1s  will  not  be  attached  to  wing staffs  or  man  wing  staff  positions  unless  total  wing  pilot  API-1  manning  is  100  percent  or better.    CCs  will  ensure  wing  staff  pilots  (API-6s)  perform  duties  justified  in  MAJCOM manpower  standards  documents  and  authorized  in  UMDs  (T-3).    AFRC:  OG/CC  may designate API positions as required to meet unit.requirement. 1.10.  Sortie Allocation Guidance: 1.10.1.  Inexperienced  API-1  pilots  will  receive  sortie  allocation  priority  over  experienced pilots. (T-3).  Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows: 1.10.1.1.  Operational  Units.  CMR  API-1,  MQT  API-1,  CMR  API-6,  MQT  API-6, BMC (API- All), API-5 pilot physicians. 1.10.1.2.  Combined  Formal  Training  and  Operational  Units.  Formal  syllabus training,  CMR/API-1,  MQT  API-1,  CMR  API-6,  MQT  API-6,  BMC  (API-All),  API-5 pilot physicians, others. 1.10.1.3.  Formal  Training  Units  and  USAFWS  .  Formal syllabus training,  Instructor Upgrade, Instructor CT, authorized staff personnel not performing Instructor or FE duties (to include API-5 pilot physicians not on instructor orders). 1.10.1.4.  Test and Test Evaluation Squadron (TES) Units.  Requirements directed by MAJCOM,  training  required  to  prepare  for  assigned  projects/tasking,  BMC  training requirements that cannot be accomplished on primary missions, API-5 pilot physicians. 1.10.2.  Wing API-6 authorizations are IAW unit manning documents. 1.10.3.  For  FTU-only  wings,  all  API-6  pilots  will  maintain  instructor  status  (optional  for WG/OG CC, FCF pilots, and one other).  These wings will fly API-1/6 pilots as required by PFT.  For wings consisting of both FTU and operational units, at least  one of the following pilots will maintain formal IP status:  WG/CC, WG/CV, OG/CC, OG/CD  (T-3).   14  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 1.10.4.  API-8  rated  personnel  flying  authorizations,  MAJCOM/IGS  inspectors  in  API-6 billets,  and Test Unit pilots will be IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance (T-2). API-8 pilots will fly the BMC sortie rate, however they are not required to complete BMC specific missions/events  or  meet  monthly  lookback  requirements  (T-3).  Test  unit  pilots  will  fly  the BMC sorite rate as a minimum and should meet monthly BMC lookback (T-3). SQ/CCs will direct  additional  sorties  if  syllabus  or  test  missions  provide  insufficient  pilot  proficiency training  (T-3).  Units  will  provide  assigned  API  6/8  flyers  adequate  resources  to  maintain minimum training requirements.  However, API-6 flyer support will not come at the expense of  the  flying  squadron's  primary  mission.  (T-3).    API  6  flyers  will  accomplish  basic  skills events  with  allotted  BMC  sorties.  (T-3).  API-8  IGS  flyers  will  strive  to  accomplish  basic skills  events  with  allotted  BMC  sorties.    If  attached  units  cannot  meet  attached  flyer requirements,  they  must  request  relief  IAW  AFI  11-401,  as  supplemented.    (T-2).  Units requiring  flying  hour  adjustments  for  attached  API-8  and  applicable  API-6  flyers  must request program changes through their MAJCOM.  (T-2). AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   15  Chapter 2 INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING 2.1.  General.  This chapter outlines Initial Qualification Training (IQT) of pilots into the F-16.  IQT includes Basic (B-Course) and Transition/Senior Officer (TX-Course) training for pilots not previously qualified in the F-16 and will normally be conducted during formal syllabus courses at a Formal Training Unit (FTU) squadron whenever possible.  Graduates of F-16 FTU will be proficient  in  air-to-air  and  air-to-ground  mission  tasks  as  indicated  by  the  Training  Task List/Course Training Standards (TTL/CTS) of the FTU syllabus. Students will graduate current and  qualified  in  ACBT,  LASDT  CAT  I  (500  feet),  NVG,  TGP,  weapons  employment qualification (GP, LGBs, IAMs, NVG HAS; EO  - Fam), and receive block differences training as required by next assignment. 2.2.  Approval/Waiver  for  IQT.  In  exceptional  circumstances,  when  FTU  training  is  not available  within  a  reasonable  time  period,  IQT  may  be  conducted  at  the  local  unit  IAW provisions of this chapter.  This local IQT will normally be conducted using appropriate formal USAF  Transition  or  Requalification  Training  Course  syllabus  tracks,  flow  programs,  and requirements.  When local  IQT is authorized, the gaining MAJCOM assumes responsibility for the burden of providing this training locally.  The following guidance applies only to other than formal course IQT. 2.2.1.  MAJCOM/A3  (ANG:NGB/A3O)  is  approval  authority  to  conduct  local  IQT,  and  is waiver  authority  to  change  the  formal  requirements  of  locally  conducted  IQT  (ANG: ACC/A3G).  Info MAJCOM/A3T (T-2). 2.2.2.  MAJCOM/CC (ANG: ACC/CG) is the approval authority for non-formal course IQT for Colonel selectees and above to be conducted at the unit to which the officer is assigned (T-2). 2.2.3.  Units  must  submit  a  waiver  request  to  conduct  local  IQT  if  the  pilot  has  been unqualified  for  greater  than  12  months.    Requests  to  conduct  local  IQT  will  include  the following: (T-2). 2.2.3.1.  Justification for the local training in lieu of formal course training. 2.2.3.2.  Summary  of  individual's  flying  experience  to  include  last  centrifuge  training date. 2.2.3.3.  Date training will begin and expected completion date. 2.2.3.4.  Complete  syllabus  to  be  executed  locally  to  include  rationale  for  any changes/exceptions to applicable formal course syllabus. 2.2.4.  Successful  completion  of  IQT  requires  the  upgrading  pilot  to  complete  an  aircraft INSTM/QUAL evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2F-16V2). 2.3.  Prerequisites.  Course  prerequisites  will  be  IAW  the  appropriate  formal  course  syllabus and the USAF Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) (T-2). 2.4.  Ground  Training.  Ground  training  may  be  tailored  to  the  individual's  background  and experience or peculiar local conditions.  However, available and current reference materials such   16  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 as AFTTP 3-3.F-16, AFTTP 3-1.F16, Operational Test Reports and Tactical Bulletins, instructor guides, and audiovisual programs, should be used as supporting materials to the maximum extent possible.  Simulator missions will be accomplished in the best simulator available. 2.5.  Flying Training: 2.5.1.  Mission  sequence  and  prerequisites  will  be  IAW  the  appropriate  formal  course syllabus (T-2). 2.5.2.  Training  will  be  completed  within  the  time  specified  by  the  syllabus,  as  approved.  Failure through MAJCOM/A3T  to  MAJCOM/A3  (ANG:  ACC/A3G)  with  pilot's  name,  rank,  reason  for delay, planned actions, and estimated completion date  (T-2). limit  requires  notification time to  complete  within the  specified 2.5.3.  Pilots  in  IQT  will  fly  under  IP  supervision  (dual  or  chased)  until  completing  the INSTM/QUAL evaluation  (T-2). 2.5.4.  Formal  course  syllabus  mission  objectives  and  tasks  are  minimum  requirements  for IQT.    However,  additional  training  events,  based  on  student  proficiency  and  background, may  be  incorporated  into  the  IQT  program  with  authorization  of  the  SQ/CC.    Additional training  due  to  student  non-progression  is  available  within  the  constraints  of  the  formal course syllabus and may be added at the discretion of the SQ/CC. 2.6.  IQT for Senior Officers: 2.6.1.  All  formal  training  courses  for  senior  officers  (colonel  selectees  and  above)  will  be conducted at FTUs unless waived IAW paragraph 2.2 (T-2). 2.6.2.  Senior  officers  must  meet  course  entry  prerequisites  and  will  complete  all  syllabus requirements unless waived IAW syllabus directives and paragraph 2.2.2 (T-2). 2.6.3.  If senior officers must be trained at the base to which they are assigned they will be in formal  training  status.    Unit  duties  will  be  turned  over  to  appropriate  deputies  or  vice commanders  until  training  is  completed.    Exceptions  to  this  policy  must  be  approved  by MAJCOM/CC (ANG: ACC/CG) (T-2). AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   17  Chapter 3 MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING 3.1.  General.  Mission Qualification Training (MQT) is a unit developed training program that upgrades  newly  assigned  B  or  TX  course  graduates  to  BMC/CMR  to  accomplish  the  unit mission.    The  culmination  of  initial  MQT  is  an  evaluation  IAW  AFI  11-2F-16V2.    For  other newly  assigned  pilots,  MQT-LAO,  SIM  MQT-1  LAO/Instruments,  and  appropriate  theater-specific  ground  training  events  are  the  minimum  requirements.    Guidance  in  this  chapter  is provided to assist SQ/CCs in executing an OG/CC approved MQT program.  Units are expected to further tailor their programs based on current qualification, experience, currency, documented performance,  and  formal  training.    Applicable  portions  of  MQT  may  be  used  to  create  a requalification  program  for  pilots  who  have  regressed  from  BMC/CMR  to  specifically  address deficiencies which caused regression. 3.1.1.  MQT will be completed within 90 calendar days (ARC: 120 calendar days).  Timing starts at the pilot's first duty day at the gaining operational unit.  If a pilot elects to take leave prior  to  entering  MQT,  the  timing  will  begin  after  the  termination  of  the  pilot's  leave.  Training  is  complete  upon  SQ/CC  certification  to  CMR/BMC.    Notify  MAJCOM/A3T  if delay  beginning  MQT  due  to  security  clearance  exceeds  30  days.    If  training  exceeds  the specified limit, units will notify MAJCOM/A3T (ANG: ACC/A3G)  (T-2). 3.1.2.  The  following  CMR/BMC  training  items  are  granted  grace  periods  for  completion after  MQT:  AAR  and  night  training  may  be  accomplished  NLT  90  days  (ARC:  180  days) from  completion  of  MQT.    Failure  to  comply  will  result  in  regression  to  N-CMR/N-BMC until  training  is  complete.    AAR  and  night  training  accomplished  in  IQT  may  fulfill  MQT requirements  as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC.  Night  training  events  require  demonstrated proficiency and currency in similar day events, unless accomplished dual with an IP. (T-2). 3.1.3.  Pilots in MQT will not fly in FLAG-level exercises or Weapons School support sorties (T-1). 3.1.4.  Prior to BMC/CMR certification, if not accomplished during FTU training, pilots must complete  initial  Weapons  Employment  Qualification  IAW  Chapter  5  and  RAP  tasking memo (T-2). 3.2.  Ground Training: 3.2.1.  Units  will  develop  blocks  of  instruction  covering  areas  pertinent  to  the  mission  as determined  by  the  SQ/CC    (T-3).  Training  accomplished  during  IQT  may  be  credited towards this requirement. 3.2.2.  Pilots transferring from another MAJCOM require region-specific airspace procedures academics before flying (T-3). 3.2.3.  Initial  Verification:  (N/A  CA/CB/TF-coded  units):    Initial  verification  will  be completed  within  90  days  (ARC:  180  days)  after  completing  MQT    (T-2).  Each  pilot  (not required  for  BMC)  will  demonstrate  to  a  formal  board  a  satisfactory  knowledge  of  the squadron’s  assigned  mission.  (T-2).    Board  composition  will  be  established  by  the  SQ/CC.  Desired  composition  is  SQ/CC  or  SQ/DO,  weapons,  electronic  combat,  intelligence,  and plans representatives.   18  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 3.3.  Simulator Training: 3.3.1.  SIM MQT profiles will be accomplished in the best available simulator.  SIM MQT-1 is  a  prerequisite  for  the  first  MQT  flight.    Locally  directed  simulator  missions  will concentrate  on  squadron  tasking  and  unique  capabilities.  (T-3).    AFRC:  Any  SIM requirements or events can be waived or replaced with flying training as required by SQ/CC. 3.3.2.  SIM  MQT--Local  Area  Orientation/Instruments.  Normal  ground  operations, standard  departure(s),  navigation,  emergency  airfield  procedures  and  approaches,  published penetration and approach to primary alternates and home base, emergency divert procedures, EPs. 3.3.3.  SIM  MQT-Day/Night  Air-to-Air  Procedures.  Trail  departure  (no  radar  lock  night rejoin),  intercepts,  EC  equipment  operation,  threat  detection  and  defensive  reactions, switchology,  emergency  procedures,  TGP  employment,  NVG  operations,  and  weapons employment IAW squadron UCML. 3.3.4.  SIM  MQT--Day/Night  Air-to-Surface  Procedures.  Heavyweight takeoff, weapons deliveries,  jettison  procedures,  EC  equipment  operation,  threat  recognition  and  defensive reactions,  local  range  procedures,  emergency  divert  procedures,  hung  ordnance  procedures, TGP employment, NVG operations, and weapons employment IAW squadron UCML. 3.4.  Flying Training.  The appropriate missions from those listed below will be used to upgrade to BMC or CMR.  Unit-developed MQT programs will use profiles typical of squadron missions. (T-3).    Maximum  use  of  armament  recording  assets  and  captive  missiles  is  encouraged  on  all MQT missions. 3.4.1.  Supervision.  A  FL-qualified  SQ  supervisor  or  IP  is  required  unless  specified otherwise.  The SQ/CC will determine the proper flight position of the supervisor/IP unless specified otherwise.  (T-3). 3.4.2.  If more than 14 calendar days elapse between sorties, an additional review sortie will be flown before continuing in the program (T-3). 3.4.3.  All  pilots  must  conduct  practice  airborne  emergency  procedures  training  during  any one  of  the  MQT  sorties.    As  a  minimum,  the  training  will  consist  of  briefing,  flying,  and debriefing a simulated critical action procedure scenario to include airborne communication with the SOF (T-2). 3.4.4.  Sortie  Requirements.  The  sorties  listed  in  paragraphs  3.4.5,  ACBT  Qualification, and 3.4.6 Air-to-Surface Training, are suggested mission profiles that the SQ/CC may use to develop  the  unit's  MQT  program  based  on  unit  tasking.    Supervision  will  be  an  IP  or  FL-qualified  SQ  supervisor.    Pilots  will  demonstrate  proficiency  in  the  following  additional minimum  events  during  MQT:  Trail  departure,  no  radar  lock  night  rejoin,  Instrument approach (precision and non-precision), and Radar Trail Arrival  (T-3). 3.4.4.1.  MQT-LAO--Mission  Objectives.  Practice local instrument  procedures,  airspace/range  familiarization,  and  emergency  airfield(s) overflight/approaches.  B/TX course graduates may combine with MQT-AHC. local  area  orientation, 3.4.4.2.  Mission  Evaluation  Checkride  (If  Required).  This sortie will be flown IAW AFI 11-202V2 and local standardization/evaluation criteria on a mission representing the unit's primary mission tasking (T-2). AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   19  3.4.5.  ACBT  Qualification.  The  following  sorties  (in  sequence)  will  be  used  to  become ACBT  qualified  (T-3).  Units  may  expand  this  program  to  achieve  desired  proficiency  or capability.  ACBT programs for pilots with previous fighter experience may be individually tailored based on experience, currency, and documented performance.  If both 4 v X TI and ACT rides were accomplished during FTU, then an FTU graduate meets the  requirements of having initial ACBT Qualification, but they may require an ACBT recurrency during MQT at their operational squadron.

Pilots must complete Initial ACDT NLT 90 days (ARC: 180 days) from MQT completion (T-2). Initial ACDT affects CMR/BMC, but is non-grounding.  All initial ACDT is to be accomplished prior to the first ACDE flight (T-2). Pilots will be ACDE certified upon the completion of initial ACDT. Pilots who accomplished initial ACDT in previous tours in a fighter type MDS are not required to reaccomplish the ACDE Flight.   20  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 3.5.1.  Ground  Training.  Pilots  will  accomplish initial  Aircrew  Chemical  Defense Training/ACDT  (LL04)  and  CT  refresher  thereafter.    Egress  Training  with  ACDE  (LL05) IAW  AFI  11-301V1  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  (AFE)  Program  and  Emergency  Parachute Training  with  ACDE  (SS09)  IAW  AFI  16-1301  Survival,  Evasion,  Resistance,  and  Escape Program will be accomplished once in a career (per MDS). (T-2). 3.5.2.  Aircrew  Chemical  Defense  Ensemble  (ACDE)  Simulator.  A simulator mission in full  ACDE  gear  (anti-exposure  suit  not  required),  harness,  and  G-suit.    Within  the  mission profile, practice doffing simulated contaminated equipment.  An ACDE simulator can count toward  EP  or  TAC  SIM  requirements  if  an  appropriate  scenario  is  flown.      Units  will  use their best available simulator for ACDE simulator training.  The ACDE SIM is accomplished only once per MDS, and will be conducted as close as possible to the first ACDE (CW) flight (but not more than 30 days prior). (T-3). 3.5.3.  Aircrew  Chemical  Defense  Ensemble  (ACDE)  Flight.  The  ACDE  flight  will  be accomplished  once  in  a  career  (unless  previously  accomplished  in  a  fighter  type  MDS). Flight  training  must  consider  limitations  of  operating  while  wearing  ACDE.    Full  donning and doffing procedures/sequence will be practiced in conjunction with the ACDE flight but the only ACDE worn in-flight will be mask, filter pack, and gloves (T-2). 3.5.4.  ACDE Flight Restrictions: 3.5.4.1.  Pilots will be fully current and qualified in an event prior to accomplishing that event on an ACDE flight (T-2). 3.5.4.2.  Minimum formation spacing is route unless fingertip is required for safe mission accomplishment (i.e., WX penetration) (T-3). 3.5.4.3.  Minimum altitude is 500 feet AGL except takeoffs, approaches and landings (T-3). 3.5.4.4.  No ACBT or night sorties. AAR requires an IP in the flight (T-3). 3.5.4.5.  Weather  minimums  are  1,500  feet  ceiling  and  3  miles  (4.8  km)  visibility  for pilots wearing ACDE (T-3). 3.5.4.6.  Dual  cockpit  operations  will  be  used  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  with  a safety  observer,  qualified  in  the  aircraft,  not  wearing  ACDE  in  the  rear  cockpit.  Solo operations  will  be  supervised  by  an  ACDE  qualified  FL  from  a  chase  position.  Formations,  to  include  chase,  are  limited  to  two-ship  and  only  one  pilot  in  the  element will  be  wearing  ACDE  unless  both  aircraft  are  dual  with  an  experienced  pilot  in  each RCP.  Pilots wearing ACDE gear will not fly in dissimilar formations (T-3). 3.5.4.7.  Operations  supervision  will  not  conduct  ACDE  flight  training  when,  in  their judgment, temperature/dew point conditions are not favorable to safe operations. (T-3). 3.6.  Flight Surgeon (FS) and Ground Liaison Officer (GLO) Training: 3.6.1.  Ground Training.  Flight Surgeons and GLOs who are assigned to tactical units and who  have  not  previously  flown  the  unit-assigned  aircraft  will  accomplish  the  following before  the  initial  flight  briefing:  Aircraft  general  review,  hanging  harness  training  (as applicable),  egress  training,  protective  equipment  training,  AGSM  training,  and  an instrument/EP simulator (optional) with a CMR/BMC pilot (T-2). AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   21  3.6.2.  Flight  Training.  The first  flight  in  the unit-assigned aircraft will be with  an IP and may  be  flown  in  conjunction  with  other  training  sorties.    The  briefing  and  sortie  will emphasize  stick/throttle  interferrence  avoidance,  communications  and  equipment,  tactical display interpretation, and the aircraft's performance envelope (T-3).   22  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General.  This  chapter  outlines  ground  and  flying  training  requirements  for  CMR,  BMC, and BAQ pilots.  Pilots must be qualified IAW AFI 11-401, AFI 11-2F-16V2, and AFI 11-202 V1/V2.  Additionally, they must complete IQT to fly in BAQ status, MQT or FTU IP upgrade to fly in BMC status, or MQT to fly in CMR status (T-2). 4.2.  Ground Training.  Ground training will be accomplished IAW the ground training table in the  RTM  (T-2).  Waiver  authority  for  the  ground  training  specified  is  IAW  the  reference directive.    Ground  training  accomplished  during  IQT/MQT  will  be  credited  toward  CT requirements  for the training cycle in  which it was accomplished.  This  list is  intended to  be a single source reference for F-16 specific ground training only, which will be tracked in ARMS.  This  list  does  not  include  non-F-16  specific  ancillary  training  (e.g.,  SABC,  IA  training)  which should  not  be  tracked  ARMS.    Where  discrepancies  exist,  the  reference  directive  takes precedence. 4.2.1.  Simulator  (SIM):  The  event  requirements  in  the  most  current  RTM  depict  the minimum  EP  and  TAC  SIM  training  requirements  to  be  accomplished  in  best  available simulator.    SQ/CC  will  determine  the  required  supervision  for  CT  SIM  missions,  based  on SIM  capabilities,  and  mission  training  objectives.    Units  will  develop  scenarios  that  cover both EP and TAC SIM missions based on expected employment tasking and general systems knowledge  requirements  (T-3).  Emphasis  will  be  placed  on  training  not  readily  attainable during daily flying activities.  Units will review scenarios each training cycle and update as required (T-3). Pilots may receive credit for training accomplished in special SIM devices or HHQ-directed simulator test support, etc., if approved by the SQ/CC (AFRC: N/A). 4.2.1.1.  During  EP  SIM  missions,  training  in  the  following  areas  will  be  accomplished each  training  cycle:  unusual  attitude  recoveries,  spatial  disorientation,  inadvertent weather entry, controlled flight departure recognition and recovery procedures, controlled and  uncontrolled  ejection  parameters,  aircraft  subsystem  failure  checklist  procedures, relevant  critical  action  procedures,  and  precision  instrument  procedures  (T-2).  Note: Pilots  may  satisfy  EP  SIM  requirements  by  accomplishing  or  administering INSTM/QUAL EP Evaluations (EPEs). 4.2.1.2.  During TAC SIM missions, training in the following areas will be accomplished each  training  cycle:    AEF  and  DOC  relevant  simulated  combat  employment,  threat recognition/reactions and counter tactics, aircraft subsystem failure checklist procedures, relevant critical action procedures (T-2). Note: Pilots may satisfy TAC SIM requirements by accomplishing or administering MSN EPEs. 4.2.2.  Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT). 4.2.2.1.  This  training  is  not  an  evaluation,  but  a  review  of  abnormal/emergency procedures  and  aircraft  systems  operations/limitations  during  realistic  scenarios.  One pilot  will  present  a  situation  and  another  discusses  actions  necessary  to  cope  with  the malfunction and carry it to a logical conclusion. Critical Action Procedures (if applicable) and  squadron  special  interest  items  will  be  emphasized.    Incorporate  the  following elements into squadron SEPT training programs: (T-2). AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   23  4.2.2.1.1.  Unless dictated otherwise by the OG/CC, SEPTs are designed and released by OGV with optional inputs by OG/CC or Squadron Leadership. 4.2.2.1.2.  Develop SEPT scenarios using actual mishaps/incidents as baseline cases.  Besides  major  EPs,  include  other  less  expected  emergencies  in  critical  phases  of flight such as uncorrectable single brake failure during landing. 4.2.2.1.3.  Discuss  at  least  one  EP  for  each  major  subsystem  (engine,  electrical, hydraulic, fuel, landing gear, flight control and auxiliary power as applicable) in each session.  The EPs will also span all phases of flight to include the role of supporting a fighter  that  has  an  emergency  (checklist  backup,  ATC  coordination  and  flight  path clearance).    For  at  least  one  emergency,  discuss  considerations  for  handling  that emergency at night. 4.2.2.1.4.  Ensure  each  of  the  following  appear  at  least  once  in  the  annual  SEPT Program  (included  in  at  least  one  of  the  monthly  SEPT  profiles):  in-scenario  touch and go (due to RCR, vehicle on RWY, canopy pooling at or near touch down, etc.), NVG SEPT with Unusual Attitudes, Horn Awareness and recovery with wing tanks, break-X  interpretation  and  appropriate  actions,  and  departure  of  prepared  surface above taxi speed. 4.2.2.1.5.  Accomplish two SEPTs each training cycle with an IP or SQ supervisor to include minimum fuel and emergency divert training. 4.2.2.2.  SEPT training will be accomplished each calendar month, and the currency will expire at the end of the following month.  Pilots with an expired SEPT are grounded until subsequently complete (T-2). 4.2.2.3.  SEPTs will be accomplished in the best available simulator.  If a simulator is not available,  accomplish  as  one-on-one  or  in  small  flight-sized  groups  as  long  as  all members participate fully  and share equal  time responding to  emergency situations.  (T-2). 4.2.2.4.  Completion  of  a  simulator  EP  profile  satisfies  the  monthly  SEPT  requirement. For an IP/FE administering the SEPT/EP Sim, this will satisfy their SEPT requirement. 4.2.2.5.  Formal course student SEPTs may satisfy the monthly SEPT requirement for the IP whom administers this training. 4.2.3.  Weapons/Tactics  Academic  Training.  Units  will  establish  a  weapons/tactics academic training program to satisfy MQT and CT requirements. Training is required in each training  cycle.    Audio-visual  programs  may  be  used  in  place  of  academic  instruction.  The program will require successful completion of an examination (85 percent minimum to pass). Use testing to validate qualification to the maximum extent possible throughout the training program. Pilots successfully scoring 85 percent or greater may be given training credit in lieu of ground CT, where authorized by the governing publication (T-2). 4.2.3.1.  Academic  instructors  will  be  USAFWS  graduates  or  have  attended  the applicable academic portion(s) of school, if possible. (T-3). 4.2.3.2.  Instruction and tests will include (as applicable), but are not limited to:  (T-3)   24  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 4.2.3.2.1.

Intelligence  personnel  develop  an  intelligence  training program  IAW AFI 14-202V1 and AFI 14-2F-16V1.  The intelligence training program will be  developed  in  coordination  with  the  unit’s  weapons  and  tactics  training  program.    The focus and extent of academic training will be determined by the OG/CC and will be aligned with  projected  wartime  tasking,  threats,  and  unit  equipage.    Supervisory  personnel  above squadron level maintaining mission qualification do not require this item (T-2). 4.2.4.1.  The  intelligence  training  plan  will  be  specifically  tailored  to  meet  unit/mission requirements.    Each  item  will  be  taught  at  least  once  during  the  annual  training  cycle.  Training  categories  include  but  are  not  limited  to  threat  knowledge,  visual  recognition (VR), collection and reporting (C&R), and personnel recovery (PR). 4.2.4.2.  Threat  Knowledge.    Threat  knowledge  training  is  tailored  to  the  unit  mission, local  area,  deployment  base(s),  and  forward  operating  locations  and  is  concentrated  on threats  in  selected  countries  with  the  potential  for  direct  unit  involvement.    Training methods  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  threat-of-the  day  briefings,  weapons  and tactics academics, theater orientation briefings, weapons system videos, etc. 4.2.4.3.  Visual  Recognition.    VR  training  is  tailored  to  the  unit  mission,  local  area, deployment base(s), and forward operating locations.   IT will include enemy/adversary, friendly or neutral weapon systems relevant to the prospective operational environment.  Training  will  teach  how  to  describe  threats  to  assist  intelligence  personnel  in  positive identification  and  include  examples  of  weapons  employment  to  illustrate  how  threats might appear when employed. 4.2.4.4.  Collection  and  Reporting.    C&R  training  enables  aircrew  to  initiate  aircrew originated  reports;  Inflight  Report  (INFLTREP),  and  Communication  Instructions Reporting Vital Intelligence Sighting (CIRVIS).  Training will familiarize them with the information  requirements  of  the  intelligence-generated  Mission  Report  (MISREP)  and Intelligence Report (INTREP).  A critical component of C&R training will be the unit’s essential  elements  of  information  (EEI).    Training  will  identify  and  describe  theater-specific and peacetime reporting requirements. (T-2). AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   25  4.2.4.5.  Personnel  Recovery.    When  assigned,  a  SERE  specialist  will  conduct  PR operational support training.  If intelligence personnel do provide PR operational support training  it  will  address:   PR  materials  (Isolated  Personnel  Report  (ISOPREP) maintenance  and  review,  evasion  plan  of  action  (EPA)  preparation)  and  theater  combat recovery procedures. (T-2). 4.2.5.  Verification: 4.2.5.1.  Continuation  verification  updates  pilots  on  their  squadron's  wartime  mission.  Each  pilot  will  participate  in  a  squadron  initial/CT  verification  as  a  briefer,  board member,  or  seminar  participant  (T-2).  Pilots  who  participate  in  a  unit  deployment  to  a tasked AOR may receive credit for continuation verification. 4.2.5.1.1.  BMC  pilots  will  accomplish  an  initial  verification  and/or  participate  in  a CT  verification  to  facilitate  future  upgrade  to  CMR  status,  at  the  discretion  of  the SQ/CC. (T-3). 4.3.  Flying  Training.  All pilots, except API-8 and MAJCOM/IGS inspectors, will accomplish the requirements shown in the Basic Skills requirements table published in the current RTM (T-3). Failure to accomplish these requirements may not affect BAQ, BMC, or CMR status but may require  additional  training  as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC.    API-8  flyers  and  MAJCOM/IGS inspectors  will  strive  to  accomplish  the  requirements  as  shown  on  this  table.    In  addition,  the following are required: 4.3.1.

Individually authorized multiple qualifications are valid as long as the individual is  assigned  to  the  specific  position,  and  aircraft  requested,  or  until  rescinded  by  the approval authority. 4.5.2.  Paragraph 4.5.1 does not apply to variants of the F-16.  These aircraft are considered the same MDS.  See paragraph 6.15 for block differences training. 4.5.3.  Multiple  qualification  is  not  appropriate  for  senior  wing  supervisors  of  units  with different types of aircraft.  Wing commanders will qualify in only one of their wing's aircraft (T-2). Either the WG/ CV or OG/CC should qualify in another of the wing's aircraft (not the same one selected by the WG/CC). 4.5.4.  Multiple  Requirements.  Pilots  will  satisfy  at  least  50  percent  of  the  sortie requirements  of  their  primary  aircraft  in  that  aircraft.    If  CMR,  they  will  meet  all  RAP sortie/event  requirements  of  the  primary  aircraft.    In  addition,  pilots  will  fly  an  equitable distribution  of  emergency  patterns, instrument  sorties,  penetrations,  non-precision approaches, and precision approaches in each MDS to fill their non-RAP requirements (T-2). 4.5.5.  Multiple Currencies.  Pilots will fly at least once each 45 days in each aircraft.  They will comply with all other currency requirements for each aircraft (T-2). 4.5.6.  Pilots must complete conversion training IAW an approved syllabus (T-2). 4.6.  Currencies/Recurrencies/Requalifications: 4.6.1.  Currency.  Table  4.1,  as  supplemented  by  the  most  current  RTM,  defines  currency requirements for all F-16 pilots.  If a pilot loses a particular currency, that sortie/event may not be performed except for the purpose of regaining currency as noted (T-2). Table 4.1.  F-16 Pilot Currencies.

In addition, BAQ pilots will fly in a super   30  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 vised status (with a FL-qualified SQ supervisor or IP) any time a non-demanding sortie is required.  2.  Recurrency supervision level is IP in aircraft or chase, qualified and current in event.  To regain RCP landing currency, FCP must be occupied by a BMC/CMR pilot with landing currency.   3.  Supervision will be FL-qualified SQ supervisor or instructor, qualified and current in the event/capability.   4.  For formal course IP's (WIC and FTU), CT and exercise participation require above currencies; formal syllabus training missions require 180 days currency.  5.  Flight leaders may update currency from either lead or wing position.  Recurrency will be accomplished from wing position. 6.  Updated by an actual weapons release on a class A/B/C range. 7.  Currency is required in the pilot’s low altitude category for operations below 1000 feet (Table 6.1).  Loss of currency requires regression to the next higher altitude block.  Operations in a lower block will update the higher block categories.  Re-currency requires satisfactory performance in the following events: vertical awareness training, hard turns, tactical formation, and offensive/defensive maneuvering. 8.  If non-current in precision approaches, increase the pilot weather minimum by one category.  To regain currency, fly  a  precision  approach.    Any  simulator  may  be  used  to  update  currency  (but  not  to  regain  currency)  provided simulator training is accomplished with WX at/below pilot minimums.   9.  Element Air-to-Air currency.  Currency is updated by accomplishing an A-A event with emphasis on blue element employment contracts and de-confliction.  Does not affect CMR.  If non-current, must accomplish a day event.  Opposed Air-to-Ground sorties that fit the definition in A2.1.24 may update this currency. 10.  For IPs, accomplishing or instructing the event from either cockpit will update currency.  WIC student sorties count as instructor sorties. 11.  Must be current in NVG Refresher Academics.  Supervision will be an NVG current, qualified pilot in the aircraft or current, FL-qualified SQ supervisor or IP in the element.. 12.  Currency is required in NVG LOWAT to fly in the night low altitude environment (IAW AFI 11-214).  Loss of currency will require re-accomplishment of single ship low altitude familiarization (IP/Sq supervisor chased) IAW para 6.7.6.8. 13.  Supervision for flight or simulator will be a current and qualified FCF pilot.  14.  For units with an MTC, this currency may be updated in the simulator as part of a tactical/EP sim profile. 15.    For  units  with  any  type  of  simulator  (UTD,  MTT,  NTC,  MTC),  this  currency  may  be  updated  as  part  of  a tactical/EP sim profile.  16.  See paragraph 4.6.8. 17. LOW  ALT LGB currency applies to  LANTIRN pilots conducting  LGB attacks in a certified  LOW  ALT block while operations are conducted using the LANTIRN system. 4.6.2.  Recurrency.  Pilots require additional training if a currency requirement is not met. 4.6.2.1.  Pilots must accomplish overdue training requirements as specified by the SQ/CC before  they  are  considered  requalified  to  perform  the  task  (T-3).  Training  annotated  as affecting CMR status will require regression to N-CMR until the pilot accomplishes the training  (T-2).  Training  identified  as  not  affecting  CMR  status  does  not  require regression  from  CMR;  however,  it  may  result  in  grounding  until  the  training  is completed.    The  duration  of  grounding  and  status  of  sortie  lookback  will  determine  the effect on CMR status. AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   31  4.6.2.2.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  supervisory  requirements  pertaining  to  recurrency may  be  satisfied  in  the  cockpit  or  flight  position  that  offers  the  best  control  of  the mission, as determined by the SQ/CC. 4.6.3.  Landing Recurrency.  Loss of landing currency requires the following action (timing starts from date of last landing): (T-2). 4.6.3.1.  31-90  Days  (46-90  Days--Experienced).  Regain  landing currency  IAW  Table 4.1. 4.6.3.2.  91-135  Days.  Same  as  paragraph  4.6.3.1,  plus  instructor  supervised  SIM (tactics,  normal  and  emergency  procedures  for  CMR  pilots;  normal,  instrument,  and emergency procedures for BMC pilots). 4.6.3.3.  136-210  Days  (136-225  Days  for  experienced).  Same  as  paragraph  4.6.3.2, plus  (CMR/BMC)  closed  and  open  book  qualification  examinations,  EPE,  and  CAPs written examination. 4.6.3.4.  211  Days 12  Months Unqualified.  Requalification  training  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1.    SQ/CCs  may conduct the requalification locally. (226  Days for experienced) to 4.6.3.5.  Greater  than  12  Months  Unqualified.  Accomplish  applicable  formal  TX course. 4.6.4.  ACBT  Recurrency.  Pilots  losing  currency  in  ACBT  require  action  IAW  the following paragraphs: (T-2). 4.6.4.1.  61-90 Days (91-120 Experienced).  BFM (offensive and/or defensive). 4.6.4.2.  91-180 Days (121-180 Experienced).  BFM (offensive and/or defensive).  Prior to  commencing  first  BFM  set,  pilot  requiring  recurrency  will  accomplish  AHC  (One Vertical Recovery and one event from the HARTS series IAW AFTTP 3-3.F-16). 4.6.4.3.  Over 180 Days.  Accomplish a SQ/CC tailored program IAW paragraph 3.4.5 4.6.5.  Loss of/Requalification to IP Status.  IPs will be decertified for: (T-2). 4.6.5.1.  Failure  of  a  flight  evaluation.    To  regain  IP  status,  the  IP  must  successfully complete a flight check IAW AFI11-202V2. 4.6.5.2.  Failure  of  an  INST/QUAL  open  book  test.    To  regain  IP  status,  the  IP  must successfully reaccomplish the written exam. 4.6.5.3.  Expiration of instructor currency.  91-180 days requires an instructor recurrency flight with an IP.  Over 180 days requires a  MSN evaluation  IAW AFI11-2F-16V2.   IP rear cockpit landing currency is 90 days.  WIC student sorties count as instructor sorties for currency.  Waiver authority is IAW AFI11-202V2 and AFI11-2F-16V2. 4.6.5.4.  Loss  of  CMR/BMC  status  due  to  loss  of  currency  in  an  event/sortie  and  the SQ/CC deems decertification is required.  If the SQ/CC does not elect this option or if the instructor  becomes  noncurrent  in  events/sorties  which  do  not  require  removal  from CMR/BMC  status,  instructor  status  may  be  retained,  but  the  IP  will  not  instruct  in  that event/sortie until the required currency is regained.   32  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 4.6.6.  NVG  Re-currency  Mission.  Pilots  losing  NVG  currency  must  accomplish  the following events prior to unrestricted night operations: (T-2). 4.6.6.1.  2-ship basic formation work / light drills and unit specific mission elements. 4.6.6.2.  Tactical turns and maneuvers. 4.6.6.3.  Minimum of one of the following night profiles/sorties: 4.6.6.3.1.  Intercept  NVG-TI  profile  not  to  exceed  2v2,  above  5,000  feet  AGL  or MSA whichever is higher, or 4.6.6.3.2.  2-ship  BSA  (OG/CC  waiverable  up  to  4-ship)  above  4,500  feet  AGL  or MSA whichever is higher, or 4.6.6.3.3.  2-ship  Unopposed  SAT/SEAD  (OG/CC  waiverable  up  to  4-ship)  above 4,500 feet AGL or MSA whichever is higher. 4.6.6.3.4.  CAS above 4,500 feet AGL or MSA whichever is higher. 4.6.7.  ACC/AOS Currency Requirements.  Units will comply with AFI 11-207 for additional currencies required for the flight delivery of aircraft coordinated through ACC/AOS (T-1). 4.6.8.  TFR Recurrency (AETC only).  Loss of TFR currency requires the following actions (timing  starts  from  date  of  last  event):  CB-coded  units  may  use  single  seat  aircraft  with  a current/qualified  IP  or  SQ  CC-designated  supervisor  in  a  chase  aircraft  to  update  TFR currency requirements (T-2). 4.6.8.1.  46-90  Days  (61-90  Experienced).  Regression  to  Medium  Altitude  until recurrent.  Accomplish a night dual-supervised TFR event. Supervision required is an IP or SQ/CC-designated supervisor current and qualified in the event. 4.6.8.2.  91-210  Days.  Accomplish  a  LANTIRN  SIM  and  a  night  dual-supervised  TFR event. 4.6.8.3.  211 Days-1 Year.  Re-accomplish unit Low Altitude LANTIRN top-off training IAW locally tailored Chap 6 upgrade program. 4.6.8.4.  Over 1 Year.  Accomplish LANTIRN requalification training. 4.7.  Regression: 4.7.1.  CMR/BMC  Regression  for  Failure  to  Meet  Lookback.  Only  RAP  training  and Contingency Operations sorties may be used for lookback.  If a pilot does not meet monthly lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, SQ/CCs can either:  Regress the pilot to N-CMR/N-BMC,  as  applicable;  remove  the  pilot  from  a  CMR/BMC  manning  position;  or initiate action to remove the pilot from active flying status (T-3). 4.7.1.1.  Failure to meet 1-month RAP/Contingency Operations sortie lookback requires a review of the pilot's 3-month sortie history.  If the 3-month lookback has been met, pilots may,  at  SQ/CC  discretion,  remain  CMR/BMC.    Failure  to  meet  the  3-month  lookback will  result  in  regression  to  N-CMR/N-BMC  status  as  appropriate,  or  the  pilot  may  be placed  in  probation  status  for  one  month  at  the  squadron  commander's  discretion.    If probation  is  chosen,  the  only  way  to  remove  a  pilot  from  probation  and  preserve  the current  status  is  to  reestablish  a  1-month  lookback  at  the  end  of  the  probation  period.  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   33  Probation will not  be used to  disguise extended shortfalls in  sorties that would result in underperforming the training cycle totals.  Probation should be used sparingly. 4.7.1.2.  CMR/BMC pilots  regressed to  N-CMR/N-BMC for lookback, must  complete a SQ/CC  approved  re-certification  program  to  include  supervision  requirements,  sortie types,  and  mission  elements  specific  to  the  N-CMR/N-BMC  aircrew  to  return  to CMR/BMC  status.    Upon  completion  of  the  re-certification  program,  the  CMR/BMC pilots  must  also  meet  1-month  lookback  requirements  prior  to  reclaiming  CMR/BMC status.  The sorties and events accomplished during the re-certification program may be credited towards their total/type sorties and events (T-2). 4.7.1.3.  Lookback  computations  begin  following  completion  of  MQT.  The  pilot  must maintain  1-month  lookback  until  3-month  lookback  is  established.  SQ/CCs  may  apply probation rules as described in paragraph 4.7.1.1 if a new CMR/BMC pilot fails to meet 1-month  lookback  while  establishing  3-month  lookback.  In  addition,  1-month  lookback will start the first full month of CMR/BMC status. (T-2). 4.7.2.  Regression  for  Weapons  Qualification.    Failure  to  maintain  RAP  tasked  weapons qualification  at  the  end  of  the  training  cycle  may  require  regression  to  N-CMR/N-BMC.  Refer to section 5.3.3 for requalification. 4.7.3.  Regression  for  Evaluation.  Pilots  who  fail  an  aircraft  qualification,  mission,  or instrument evaluation will be handled IAW AFI 11-202V2.  Pilots will regress to N-CMR or N-BMC  as  applicable.    These  pilots  will  remain  N-CMR/N-BMC  until  successfully completing required corrective action, a reevaluation, and are recertified by the SQ/CC (T-2). 4.8.  End  of  Cycle  Requirements.  Pilots  who  fail  to  complete  mission  and/or  event requirements  of  this  instruction  at  the  end  of  the  training  cycle  may  require  additional  training depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency.  Refer to paragraph 4.9 to see if some of these  requirements  can  be  prorated.    In  all  cases,  report  training  shortfalls  IAW  paragraph 1.2.5.12 (T-2). 4.8.1.  Pilots failing to meet total training cycle RAP mission requirements may continue CT at CMR/BMC as determined by lookback.  The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is required (T-3). 4.8.2.  Pilots  failing  to  meet  RAP  mission  type  requirements  will  result  in  one  of  the following: (T-3). 4.8.2.1.  Regress to N-CMR/N-BMC if SQ/CC determines the mission type deficiency is significant.    To  regain  CMR/BMC  the  pilot  must  complete  all  deficient  sortie  types.  These sorties may count towards total requirements for the new training cycle (T-3). 4.8.2.2.  Continue at CMR/BMC if total RAP sorties and lookback are maintained and the sortie type deficiencies are deemed insignificant by the SQ/CC (T-3). 4.8.3.  Pilots  failing  to  accomplish  sorties  required  for  Special  Capabilities/Qualifications will  lose  their  qualification  (T-2).    The  SQ/CC  will  determine  requalification  requirements (T-3). 4.9.  Proration  of  End-of-Cycle  Requirements.  At  the  end  of  the  training  cycle,  the  SQ/CC may  prorate  all  training  requirements  when  DNIFs,  emergency  leaves,  Consecutive  Overseas Tour (COT) leaves, non-flying TDY/exercises combat/contingency deployments, (ANG: and or   34  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 mandatory  training  required  by  civilian  employment),  preclude  training  for  a  portion  of  the training period.  Use Table 4.2 to determine proration.  Normal leave will not be considered as non-availability.  Extended bad weather, which precludes the unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive  days  may  be  considered  as  non-availability.    (ANG:  End-of-cycle  proration  is permitted for documented attrition (e.g., HHQ or weather cancels, MNDs, ground or air aborts) in monthly increments when the total number of occurrences ranges from one half to one times the individual’s normal monthly rate of flying). Commanders will not prorate for time deployed for contingency operations unless the individual(s) were assigned to non-flying positions (T-2).  The following guidelines apply: Table 4.2.  Proration Allowance. CUMULATIVE DAYS OF NON-FLYING MONTHS OF PRORATION ALLOWED 0 – 15 16 – 45 46 – 75 76 – 105 106 – 135 136 – 165 166 – 195 196 – 225 226 – 255 256 – 285 286 – 315 316 – 345 346 – 375 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 4.9.1.  Proration  will  only  be  used  to  adjust  for  genuine  circumstances  of  training  non-availability  and  not  to  mask  maintenance,  FHP  execution,  training  or  planning  deficiencies (T-2). 4.9.2.  Proration  is  based  on  cumulative  days  of  non-availability  for  flying  in  the  training cycle.    Use  Table  4.2  to  determine  the  number  of  months  to  be  prorated  based  on  the cumulative number of calendar days the pilot was not available for flying during the training cycle. (T-2). 4.9.3.  If IQT or MQT is reaccomplished a pilot's training cycle will start over at a prorated share following completion of IQT/MQT training. 4.9.4.  Example:  Capt  Jones  was  granted  17  days  of  emergency  leave  in  January  and attended SOS in residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days.  His AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   35  SQ/CC  authorized  a  total  of  two  months  proration  from  his  training  cycle  (two  months  for the 73 cumulative days of non-availability for flying).  (ANG:  Maj Smith is an experienced CMR pilot with a normal monthly requirement of 6 sorties.  He had eight attrition occurences throughout  the  training  cycle,  therefore  his  SQ/CC  can  prorate  one  month  of  Maj  Smith’s training requirements). 4.9.5.  Prorated  numbers  resulting  in  fractions  of  less  than  0.5  will  be  rounded  to  the  next lower whole number; however, no requirement may be prorated below one (T-2). 4.9.6.  Newly assigned/converted pilots and pilots achieving CMR/BMC after the 15th of the month  are  considered  to  be  in  CT  on  the  first  day  of  the  following  month  for  proration purposes.  A prorated share of RAP sorties must be completed in CT (T-2). 4.9.7.  Night  and  AAR  requirements  accomplished  during  MQT  may  be  credited  toward prorated CT requirements if accomplished during the cycle in  which the  pilot  was declared CMR/BMC unless specified otherwise by MAJCOM. 4.9.8.  A  pilot's  last  month  on  station  prior  to  departing  PCS  may  be  prorated  provided  1 month's proration is not exceeded.  Individuals departing PCS may be considered CMR for reporting purposes until loss of CMR currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty station, whichever occurs first. 4.9.9.  CMR  pilots  who  attend  USAF  Weapons  School  in  TDY-and-return  status  may  be reported throughout the TDY as CMR.  Upon return, those pilots will accomplish a prorated share of sortie/ event requirements (see Table 4.2) (T-2). 4.9.10.  Contingency  Operations.  Contingency  operations  can  have  a  positive  or  negative impact  on  a  unit's  CT  program,  as  emphasis  is  on  supporting  the  actual  contingency.    A potential lack of training opportunities while supporting contingency operations can place a burden  on  the  unit,  forcing  it  to  accomplish  the  majority  of  its  CT  program  in  a  reduced period  of  time  or  with  reduced  assets.  The  following  proration  procedures  are  intended  to provide flexibility in accomplishing the unit's CT program (T-2). 4.9.10.1.  Missions  flown  during  contingency  operations  do  not  count  toward  RAP requirements, but may be used for lookback purposes.  RAP events accomplished during contingency operations may be used to update currencies (i.e., landing currency) but they do not count toward training cycle requirements  (Exception:  AAR can be used to update currencies  and  count  toward  training  cycle  requirements).    (ANG/AFRC:  individuals deployed  for  more  than  a  seven-day  period  may  prorate  a  one-month  portion  of  RAP missions and events.) 4.9.10.2.  As  the  training  quality  of  missions  flown  at  contingency  locations  may  vary considerably,  OG/CCs  are  authorized  to  allow  sorties  that  provided  valid  training  to  be logged  as  RAP  sorties  (T-3).    Events  accomplished  on  these  sorties  count  toward  RAP event requirements, and these sorties/events may not be prorated (T-2). 4.10.  Regaining CMR/BMC Status: 4.10.1.  If  CMR/BMC  status  is  lost  due  to  failure  to  meet  the  end  of  cycle  weapons qualifications and/or event requirements, requalification is IAW paragraph 5.3.3 (T-2). 4.10.2.  If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.7.1, the following applies (timing starts from the date the pilot came off CMR/BMC status): (T-2).   36  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 4.10.2.1.  Up  to  90  Days.  The  pilot  must  complete  SQ/CC  directed  re-certification program in accordance with paragraph 4.7.1.2  In addition, all RAP event currencies must be  regained.    The  SQ/CC  will  approve  any  other  additional  training  prior  to  re-certification to CMR. 4.10.2.2.  91-180  Days.  Same as above, plus Stan/Eval generated open and closed book written examinations. 4.10.2.3.  181  Days  and  Beyond:  Reaccomplish  MQT  to  include  a  Form  8  Mission Evaluation. 4.11.  Example of the Lookback, Regression, Proration, and Requalification Process: 4.11.1.  Capt  Smith  is  an  experienced  CMR  pilot  in  ACC  with  a  1  and  3  month  lookback requirement of 9 and 27 RAP missions respectively.  On 3 Feb, he flew an ACBT sortie prior to  departing  for  a  non-flying  TDY  for  two  months.    He  reported  back  for  flight  duty  on  6 Apr.  What is his status throughout his TDY and on his return? 4.11.1.1.  The SQ/CC wanted to list Capt Smith as a countable CMR pilot for reporting purposes throughout the TDY.  Therefore, on 1 Mar, his Flt/CC performed the mandatory 1-month  lookback  (Feb)  on  Capt  Smith.    He  only  flew  one  RAP  sortie,  failing  the  1-month lookback.  The Flt/CC then performed a 3-month lookback (Dec, Jan, Feb).  This showed that he flew only 24 sorties for this period.  Had he flown three more sorties, his SQ/CC could continue Capt Smith at CMR.  With 21 sorties, Capt Smith did not meet the 3-month  lookback  for  a  CMR  pilot.    The  SQ/CC  could  regress  Capt  Smith  to  N-CMR, but instead elected to put him on probation, still carrying him as CMR. 4.11.1.2.  The  SQ/CC  decided  to  carry  Capt  Smith  on  probation  for  one  month.    On  1 Apr, Capt Smith's 1 month lookback (Mar) was 0 sorties.  The SQ/CC must now regress Capt Smith to N-CMR.  When Capt Smith returns, the SQ/CC will have to place him in a re-certification  program.    Upon  completing  this  program,  Capt  Smith  will  need  to  re-establish  his  1-month  lookback  by  1  May.    Failing  to  do  so  would  force  him  to  be reported N-CMR one more month until the next lookback process on 1 June. 4.11.1.3.  If he had returned on 22 Mar, and had last landed the jet 48 days ago, he could fly a non-demanding sortie to regain demanding sortie and landing currency.  For CMR purposes, Capt Smith would need to complete 9 RAP missions to recapture his 1-month lookback and get off probation.  Although Capt Smith was still CMR in Mar, the SQ/CC flew  him  with  an  IP  on  his  first  few  sorties  to  regain  his  landing,  AAR,  LOWAT,  and Formation T/O and Landing currencies. 4.11.1.4.  At the end of the training cycle on 30 Jun, the SQ/CC prorated 2 months off of Capt  Smith's  total  requirements.    In  spite  of  this  proration,  Capt  Smith  was  deficient  in one  mission  category.    The  SQ/CC  could  regress  Capt  Smith  to  N-CMR  if  deemed significant.    After  accomplishing  the  tailored  recertification  program  (in  this  case,  the deficient sorties), the SQ/CC would recertify Capt Smith to CMR.  This training counts for the new training cycle. AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   37  Figure 4.1.  Regression Flow Chart. 4.12.  Instrument Training. 4.12.1.  OGs will develop an instrument training program IAW AFM 11-210 (T-1). 4.12.2.  Units  which  seldom  encounter  bad  weather  and/or  night  recoveries  will  exercise pilots  and approach facilities by periodically simulating "weather day"  recovery operations, as determined by the SQ/CC. (T-3). 4.12.3.  Pilots  transferring  from  another  MAJCOM  require  the  theater-specific  portions  of IRC before flying without a theater-experienced pilot in the formation.  MQT academics and the MQT LAO mission may satisfy this requirement.    38  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 4.12.4.  RAP  events  may  be  accomplished  on  an instrument  mission  provided accomplishment  does  not  interfere  with  the  primary  goal  of  instrument  training.    The transition  from  instruments  to  visual  references  will  be  practiced  on  all  instrument approaches.  (T-3).    An  instrument  sortie  is  a  basic  skills  requirement  and  may  be  credited toward monthly RAP lookback only IAW the RTM. 4.13.  G-Awareness  Continuation  Training.  Units  will  develop  a  CT  program  that  provides feedback to pilots and imprints a proper L-1 AGSM so that it becomes an integral part of pulling Gs (T-1). 4.13.1.  The  basis  of  this  program  is  to  give  each  FL,  SQ  supervisor,  flight  surgeon  and,  if available,  aerospace  physiologist  the  skills  needed  to  evaluate  a  flight  member's  AVTR  to ensure  a  proper  AGSM  is  being  performed.    This  program  also  makes  assessment  of  the AGSM  a  normal  debrief  item  after  every  flight.    The  assessment  will  be  done  as  a  normal part of AVTR assessment while reviewing other tactical portions of the mission. (T-3). 4.13.2.  Use the following minimum guidance to implement the unit's program: (T-1). 4.13.2.1.  AGSM  technique  and  assessment  will  be  incorporated  into  the  squadron  CT program.  Emphasis will be placed on briefing, debriefing, and assessing the L-1 AGSM using  the  AVTR  in  the  debrief  on  a  daily  basis.    FLs,  IPs,  SQ  supervisors,  and  flight surgeons  will  become  adept  at  assessing  and  teaching  the  correct  AGSM.    Academics will include a discussion of the limitations imposed on aircraft performance as a result of an ineffective AGSM. (T-2). 4.13.2.2.  The G-awareness exercise will be flown IAW the guidance in AFI 11-2F-16V3. 4.13.2.3.  FLs  will  assess  the  AGSM  effectiveness  of  flight  members  during  mission debriefings.    This  assessment  should  not  be  limited  to  the  G-awareness  exercise.  Evaluate  the  AGSM  after  the  pilot  has  had  the  time  to  fatigue  to  get  an  accurate assessment  of  a  pilot's  AGSM  during  a  tactically  and  G-demanding  portion  of  flight.  AGSM will also be evaluated under relatively low intensity G such as A/S sorties. (T-2). 4.13.2.4.  An A/A mission tape for each pilot will be reviewed each training cycle by the squadron flight surgeon, aerospace physiologist, or a squadron supervisor.  The reviews will be documented. 4.13.3.  FLs or SQ supervisors will identify pilots  having poor  AGSM technique or low G-tolerance  to  the  Flt/CC  or  appropriate  operations  supervisor.    The  SQ/DO  or  appropriate operations  supervisor  will  determine  what  action  is  required  to  improve  the  pilot's  G-tolerance.  The SQ/CC will determine if refresher training is required IAW AFI 11-404. 4.14.  Hi-AoA  Training.  AFMC's  416FLTS  has  developed  Hi-AoA  academics  and  flight instruction.  The training is available at Edwards AFB or 416FLTS  IPs can travel if units have access  to  appropriate  airspace  to  conduct  deep  stall/recovery  training  as  defined  in  AFMC guidance.    The  training  purpose  is  to  teach  the  pilot  how  to  recognize,  recover  from,  and ultimately avoid deep stalls.  Pilots will receive this instruction at least once, preferably early, in their career. (T-2). AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   39  Chapter 5 WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT QUALIFICATION 5.1.  General.  This  chapter  outlines  requirements  for  attaining  initial  qualification  and maintaining CT qualification in the employment of air-to-surface and air-to-air weapons.  Refer to  "Glossary  of  Missions/Sorties/Events"  at  Attachment  2  for  further  guidance  on  weapons qualifications. 5.2.  Initial  qualification  (QUAL):  Pilots  must  attain  initial  qualification  in  any  weapon  or weapon  category listed  as QUAL in the RAP  Tasking memo  (T-2).  Initial  qualification can be attained in IQT or MQT, and may be credited toward CT qualification requirements. 5.2.1.  Initial  qualification  and  requalification  in  a  weapon  or  weapon  category  is  satisfied when the pilot has achieved a minimum of 3 hits out of 6 consecutive employment attempts.  Initial qualification will carry over for consecutive F-16 assignments. 5.3.  CT  qualification  (QUAL):  Pilots  must  maintain  qualification  in  any  weapon  or  weapon category listed as QUAL in the RAP Tasking memo (T-2). These criteria establish the minimum standards for a pilot to maintain qualification and do not necessarily determine evaluation criteria established by other instructions or agencies (e.g., inspection/evaluation teams). 5.3.1.  CT  weapons  employment  will  be  from  tactical  deliveries  or  intercepts  simulating realistic employment of  UCML munitions.  (T-2). To maintain  a combat  perspective during training,  CT  air-to-surface  weapons  employment  qualification  requirements  will  be accomplished using full scale live/inert munitions and Standard Conventional Loads (SCLs) to the maximum extent possible (T-2). To achieve this, units will strive to schedule full scale live/inert munitions such that every CMR pilot and the maximum number of aircraft have the opportunity to expend. 5.3.2.  QUAL for air-to-surface weapons requires a hit rate of 50 percent when compared to total  employment  attempts.    QUAL  for  air-to-air  weapons  requires  a  75%  hit  rate  (valid  at pickle/trigger  squeeze)  when  compared  to  total  employment  attempts.    Hit  criteria  is  IAW AFTTP 3-1.F-16 and/or this Volume, as applicable.  The RAP Tasking memo further defines QUAL requirements based on the training cycle. 5.3.2.1.  Video  assessment.    100%  of  guided  air-to-surface  and  air-to-air  weapons employment qualification requirements can be video assessed.  Unguided Munitions and Strafe  require  actual  weapons  employment.    Squadron  Commanders  can  waive  the requirement for actual weapons employment in locations where limited range availability prohibits sufficient employment opportunities, provided and equal number of dry, video- assessed attempts are accomplished (T-3). 5.3.2.2.  At  the  end  of  the    training  cycle,  each  pilot's  weapons  employment  statistics (hit/miss  percentages)  will  be  reviewed  to  assess  qualifications  (T-2).  Weapons employment qualifications are valid through the subsequent training cycle. 5.3.3.  Failure  to  Qualify:  Failure  to  qualify  in  one  weapon  or  weapon  category  does  not invalidate  qualification  in  others.    SQ/CCs  may  declare  a  pilot  unqualified  in  a  weapon  or weapon  category  at  any  time  during  a  training  cycle  without  affecting  other  weapon employment qualifications. If qualification is required at CMR/BMC, failure to qualify will   40  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 result in regression to N-CMR/N-BMC until requalification is accomplished IAW paragraph 5.2.1 (T-2). 5.4.  Familiarization  (FAM):  Familiarization  for  weapons  does  not  require  a  hit  rate  when compared  to  total  employment  attempts.    The  RAP  Tasking  memo  further  defines  FAM requirements based on the training cycle. 5.5.  Weapons Employment Parameters.  The event requirements and parameters listed below form  the  basic  framework  for  pilot  weapons  employment  training.    All  weapons  employment will  conform  to  the  limits  established  for  each  specific  event  (T-2).  Pattern  descriptions, procedures,  training  rules,  and  foul  criteria  are  contained  in  AFI  11-2F-16V3  and  AFI  11-214.  Events performed at night may require higher minimum recovery altitudes based on AFI 11-214. 5.5.1.  Strafe  Events.  Tactical  Strafe  (TAC  STRF)  is  a  combined  event.        Any combination  of  LAS  and/or  HAS  hits  satisfies  this  training  requirement.    Each  pass  is  a standalone  event  for  weapons  employment  qualification  with  a  maximum  of  3  passes  per sortie.    Hit  criteria  (regardless  of  aircraft  rounds  limiter  setting):  acoustically  scored  or independently observed impacts on a point target, or bullet dispersion within 36 feet of any target.  For VTR assessment: a stabilized pipper on target during witness cue. 5.5.1.1.  Low  Angle  Strafe  (LAS).  Planned  dive  angle  15  degrees  or  less.      Minimum recovery altitude is 75 feet AGL.  Foul line is 2,000 feet. 5.5.1.2.  High Angle Strafe (HAS).  Planned dive angle greater than 15 degrees. 5.5.1.2.1.

For weapons qualifications purposes, laser JDAM will be  counted  towards  either  an  LGB  or  IAM  event,  depending  on  the  mode  of  terminal guidance.   If the bomb receives terminal laser guidance, it is an LGB event.  Bomb-on-coordinate (BOC) deliveries (without terminal laser guidance) are IAM events 5.5.2.5.  AGM-88  High  Speed  Antiradiation  Missile  (HARM).  Maneuver as required to achieve weapon employment.  Acquisition and launch may be performed from a level, climbing, or diving maneuver to achieve firing parameters.  A maximum of 4 HTS and 4 HAS shots may be credited toward qualification per mission.  4 HAS shots per training cycle  must  be  with  a  CATM.    Hit  criteria:    valid  HARM  launch  (actual  or  simulated) IAW AFTTP 3-1.Shot Kill at pickle as determined by VTR review. 5.5.3.

This  chapter  outlines  upgrade  training  programs  for special capabilities and qualifications.  These programs  are intended to  provide a basic starting point and may be modified by the SQ/CC based on the unit's requirements and/or the upgradee's previous experience, qualifications, and documented performance.  Unless governed by a formal syllabus, ground and device training for these programs will consist of unit-developed academics and scenarios.  Flight training will be conducted in accordance with a program approved by the SQ/CC (T-3). 6.2.  Flight  Lead  (FL)  Upgrade.  This  program  establishes  the  minimum  guidelines  for  those pilots identified by the SQ/CC to upgrade to flight lead.  This program takes an F-16 pilot with demonstrated  tactical  proficiency  as  a  wingman  and  teaches  flight  leadership  and  decision-making. 6.2.1.  Initial entry may be as a two-ship/element FL until experience and proficiency warrant further  progression,  in  which  case,  responsibilities  for  employment  will  not  exceed  two aircraft until certified as a four-ship FL.  The SQ/CC will determine when a two-ship FL may train toward larger, more complex formations (three- or four-ship) (T-3). 6.2.2.  The  following  minimum  flying  hours  are  required  prior  to  entering  FL  upgrade training: (T-3). 6.2.2.1.  300 hours F-16, or 6.2.2.2.  200 hours F-16 with 400 hours IP/FP/MP in a 11Fxx, 11K3C, or 11K3D, 11K3F AFSC, or 6.2.2.3.  50 hours F-16, if previously qualified as a 11Fxx AFSC flight lead. 6.2.2.4.  (ANG  &  AFRC  only)  For  converting  units,  OG/CC's  may  select  prior  flight lead qualified pilots to upgrade to flight lead concurrently with the MQT top off program regardless of PAI hours. 6.2.3.  Ground  Training.  Ground  training  will  consist  of  locally  developed  instruction  in the following areas.  Add unit specific  ground training items  for unique  ordnance, pods, or capabilities (T-3). 6.2.3.1.  FL  Responsibilities.  FL/wingman  relationship,  airmanship,  judgment  and maturity will be addressed as they relate to flying and squadron related duties. 6.2.3.2.  Mission  Preparation.  Mission  objectives,  wingman requirements  and responsibilities,  currencies,  capabilities,  delegation  of  mission  planning  duties,  and briefing preparation. 6.2.3.3.  Conduct  of  Flight  Briefings  and  Debriefings.  Objectives,  use  of  briefing guides  and  audiovisual  aids,  flight  member techniques, debriefing/questioning techniques, tape review responsibilities and procedures. involvement,  briefing 6.2.3.4.

To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  high-fidelity  simulator training will be incorporated into FL upgrade.  SIM missions will precede flight training whenever  possible  and  reinforce  common  errors  allowing  upgrade  pilots  to  repeatedly practice  upgrade  tasks.    Emergency  procedures,  lost  wingman,  and  instrument  training will be demonstrated in the sim, if available. 6.2.4.  Flight  Training.  Flight  training  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  an  upgrade program approved by the SQ/CC (T-3).  Missions may be flown in any order.  The program outlined below provides a basic starting point and may be modified by squadron commanders based  on  unit  needs  and/or  upgradee's  previous  experience,  qualifications,  and  documented performance.    All  FLUG  training  will  be  under  the  supervision  of  an  IP  or  flight  lead-qualified  squadron  supervisor  flying  as  the  upgrading  student’s  wingman  (T-2).  Dissimilar adversaries will be used to the maximum extent practical during FLUG training.  Units will add considerations/techniques for specialized capability (TGP, HTS, etc) to applicable areas (T-3). 6.2.4.1.  FLUG  Event  Requirements.    Two  formation  takeoffs  and  landings,  a  day  or night aerial refueling, trail departure, and a trail recovery will be accomplished as a flight lead during the program. (T-3). 6.2.4.2.

Forward  Air  Controller  (Airborne)  (FAC[A])  Upgrade.  This  program  establishes  the minimum  guidelines  for  those  pilots  identified  by  the  SQ/CC  for  FAC(A)  upgrade  training.   Students must complete all missions in the following profiles to gain FAC(A) certification IAW  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   57  the current Joint Close Air Support FAC(A) Memorandum of Agreement (JMOA) and will not proficiency advance.  Squadrons may not deviate from these profiles, and OG/CC is the waiver authority for all FAC(A) training (T-3). 6.8.1.  Upgrade  Administration.  FAC(A)  certification  (upgrade)  training  will  be  IAW  the current  Joint  Close  Air  Support  FAC(A)  Memorandum  of  Agreement  (JMOA)  (T-2).  The JMOA defines the Joint Mission Task List (JMTL) for a FAC(A) to attain certification and maintain qualification/currency, and the SQ/CC will ensure all of these JMTLs are met in the course  of  training.    Following  the  upgrade,  FAC(A)s  will  be  capable  of  performing  all FAC(A) mission tasks defined in the current JMOA.  OG/CCs or their designated squadron commander representatives have authority to waive any JMOA experience requirements for upgrade  entry  based  on  commanders'  judgment  of  experience  level  (T-3).    Where  conflicts exist between this FAC(A) Upgrade and the Joint Close Air Support FAC(A) Memorandum of Agreement (JMOA), the MOA shall have precedence. 6.8.1.1.  To  ensure  standardization  and  efficiency,  MAJCOMs/Fighter  Wings  are authorized and encouraged to adopt this instruction as their sole guidance for conducting FAC(A) training in lieu of local syllabi. 6.8.1.2.  Training at the F-16 FTU is available to reduce burden on home-station training.  AETC  FTU  OG/CC  is  responsible  for  coordinating  and  adjudicating  FTU  course apportionment IAW MAJCOM requirements.  When the FTU is conducting training for other MAJCOM pilots, AETC FTU OG and unit OG are the combined waiver authority for prerequisites or waivers (T-3). 6.8.1.3.  Units will ensure FAC(A)s maintain qualification and currency IAW the JMOA (T-3). SQ/CCs must ensure upgrades meet JMOA specific requirements for number and types  of  controls.    Re-qualification  will  include  at  least  one  day  and  one  night  mission defined  by  the  SQ/CC  that  meet  re-qualification  control  requirements.        Pilots  will  log any  FAC(A)  evaluations  required  by  the  JMOA  in  either  their  CAS  control  log  and/or with a squadron standard gradesheet.  These evaluations do not require a Form 8, and do not  require  a  SEFE  to  conduct  the  evaluation.    Qualification  as  a  FAC(A)  IP  also qualifies the IP to conduct FAC(A) evaluations. 6.8.1.4.  Prior to  FAC(A) certification, the SQ/CC will personally interview the UP  and review FAC(A) responsibilities and authority.  The SQ/CC will certify the new FAC(A)’s status,  including  any  restrictions,  in  appropriate  written  format  (grade  sheet,  training folder,  Letter  of  Xs,  etc.).    The  FAC(A)  will  log  all  controls  accomplished  during  and after  training  in  the  JCAS  AP  MOA  Appendix  A  format  as  part  of  their  training documentation (T-3). 6.8.1.5.  Pilots  identified  for  FAC(A)  upgrade  must  meet  the  following  minimum requirements (T-3). Track 1 produces mission capable F-16 FAC(A)s. Track 2 produces FAC(A) instructors.

Helmet  Mounted  Display  (HMD)  Qualification  Training.  References  to  HMD  in  this volume  include  all  types  of  helmet  mounted  displays  to  include  the  F-16CM  Joint  Helmet Mounted  Cueing  System  (JHMCS)  and  the  F-16C+  Scorpion  Helmet  Mounted  Integrated Targeting (HMIT) system.  The purpose of this program is to train IPs, flight leads, and wingmen in  HMD symbology operation and employment.  The program  outlined below provides a basic starting  point  and  may  be  modified  by  SQ/CC  based  on  unit  needs  and/or  previous  pilot experience, qualifications, and performance (T-3). This upgrade is not required if more than two MQT, FLUG, or IPUG sorties were flown with a HMD.  Flight qualification in one type of HMD will satisfy the flying requirement for all types of HMD.  Ground and simulator training must be accomplished in the same system (JHMCS/HMIT) required to be used in the aircraft (T-2). 6.11.1.  Ground  Training.  The  following  requirements  must  be  accomplished  prior  to  the first sortie: (T-2) 6.11.1.1.  HMD  Academics.  Initial  academics  will  be  accomplished  locally  or  during simulator  orientation  (if  available).    Academic  courseware  will  be  approved  by ACC/TRSS.    Academics  will  be  accomplished  within  60  days  prior  to  the  first  HMD qualification sortie.  If more than 60 days  elapse  between  academics  and  the first  sortie, pilots will re-accomplish academics (T-2).   64  AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015 6.11.1.2.  HMD  Simulator  Orientation  Training.  HMD-modified  simulators  may  not be available for initial orientation training.  If a simulator with HMD is readily available to  a  unit,  pilots  will  complete  HMD  SIM-1  prior  to  flight  (T-2).    If  a  simulator  is  not available, SQ/CCs will determine if the simulator should be waived, accomplished via a table-top  discussion,  or  accomplished  in  conjunction  with  a  sortie  or  upgrade  through extended ground operations. (T-3). 6.11.1.2.1.  HMD  SIM-1  Mission  Objectives.  Introduce  HMD  preflight,  ground operations,  radar/missile  cueing,  HMD  degraded  and  failure  modes,  system limitations,  emergency  egress,  ejection,  and  human  factors  implications  (display fixation,  fatigue,  etc.).    Specific  Tasks:  HMD  preflight,  strap-in,  boresight,  ground operations,  occlusion  zone  selection,  declutter  options,  switchology/HOTAS functions,  radar  and  missile  (AIM-9M/X)  cueing  and  symbols,  Link16/SADL symbology,  and  after  landing  checks.    JHMCS  specific  tasks  include  “uplook” boresight  and  cueing;  HMIT  specific  tasks  include  HMIT  MFD  functions,  RMFD video display and brightness/contrast adjustment, occlusion zone manipulation, NVG pre-flight  focus  and  fit,  and  NVG  backup  mode.  Special  subjects  to  be  emphasized during  all HMD training include the potential for display  fixation and ejection risks (T-2). 6.11.2.  General Instructions 6.11.2.1.  CMR/BMC  pilots  may  conduct  HMD  training  separately  or  as  part  of  any upgrade. 6.11.3.  Flying  Training.    If  HMD  SIM-1  is  required  IAW  para  6.11.1.2  the  sim  will  be accomplished  prior  to  the  first  flight.  To  the  max  extent  practical,  TGPs  and  AIM-9X CATMs will be utilized during the HMD upgrade missions.  The HMD-1 upgrade flight will be tailored to the experience level of the individual pilot and may be modified or waived at the discretion of the SQ/CC. (T-3). 6.11.3.1.  HMD-1.  Mission Objectives: Introduce HMD functions and practice A-A/A-G mission sets using the HMD.  Specific Mission Tasks: Practice HMD ground procedures, HOTAS  operation,  radar  and  missile  cueing,  (JHMCS  only)  airborne  uplook  alignment and  cueing,  (JHMCS  only)  airborne  realignment,  (HMIT  only)  RMFD  video  display, radar/missile cueing, A-A/A-G threat reactions, CAS wheel operations, TGP cueing, and HMD  marks.    HMD-1  will  be  flown  under  the  supervision  of  a  HMD-qualified  IP  or HMD-qualified squadron supervisor (T-2). 6.12.  Alert Camera.  CMR/BMC pilots with an operational requirement to fly with cameras on active air defense alert (ACA/ONE) missions will complete this training.  (T-2). Ground training will be coordinated through the squadron training officer and unit intel, and is only required prior to being scheduled for alert duty where flight with a camera is required by an ATO.  Possessing an adequate supply of cameras to equip a normally tasked number of alert aircraft and having a plan to accomplish training as described above satisfies the requirement to have an alert camera capability.  Use of cameras will be IAW AFI 11-202V3. (T-2). 6.12.1.  Ground  training  will  cover  operation  of  a  basic  point-and-shoot  camera  and intelligence  gathering  techniques,  MAJCOM/local  restrictions  on  the  use  of  cameras  in  the cockpit, and hands-on cockpit training in the best available training device. (T-3). AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   65  6.13.  Low  Altitude  Step-Down  Training  (LASDT).  This  training  is  normally  conducted  as part of IQT.  It may be used to requalify pilots who are significantly out of currency or to train pilots to a lower category. 6.13.1.  To conduct low altitude operations safely, pilots need to be knowledgeable of aircraft handling  and  performance  characteristics, intercept,  offensive maneuvering,  defensive  reactions,  and  navigation.    LASDT  qualifies  pilots  to  conduct  low altitude  training  (LOWAT)  at  or  below  1,000  feet  AGL.    LOWAT  block/category certification  is  required  prior  to  performing  unsupervised  operations  in  that  block/category (T-2). formation, tactical 6.13.2.  To provide a structured approach, the step-down training program is built on a multi-phase training process IAW Table 6.1  There is no time limit to progress beyond Category I and  progress  will  be  based  upon  individual  pilot  proficiency  and  training  availability.    All LASDT  missions  will  be  supervised  by  an  IP  or  FL-qualified  SQ  supervisor  who  has completed LASDT training and is current in the LOWAT category being instructed (T-2). Table 6.1.  LOWAT Categories. Category Altitude Block Upgrade Sorties To Certify I II III 1,000-500 LASDT-1, LASDT-2, LASDT-3 Below 500-300 LASDT-5, LASDT-6, LASDT-7 Below 300-100 LASDT-8, LASDT-9, LASDT-10 6.13.3.  Category  I  qualification  is  a  minimum  requirement  for  CMR  status.    Units  may accept a transfer pilot's LOWAT qualification from other units.  Category II training may not be conducted during MQT. (T-2). 6.13.4.  Entry into LASDT (other than at FTU) requires SQ/CC approval (T-3). The altitude to which a pilot is certified is determined by the SQ/CC and based on the lowest altitude at which  all  tasks  can  be  comfortably  performed  and  proficiency  demonstrated.    The  goal  is proficiency  down  to  the  minimum  altitude  compatible  with  squadron  mission.    Upon successful completion of LASDT training, the SQ/CC will certify the pilot to the minimum approved altitude of the LASDT category (T-2).  Squadrons may accept documented LASDT certification  for  pilots  coming  from  other  units/commands.    With  SQ/CC  approval,  low altitude training conducted at a formal course may be used to fulfill applicable requirements of this paragraph. 6.13.5.  LASDT  will  be  scheduled  and  briefed  as  a  primary  portion  of  the  mission.  Compatible RAP CT events may be accomplished in conjunction with LASDT as long as the objectives of the LASDT sortie are met.  LASDT will not be flown as an alternate mission (T-2). 6.13.6.  Ground  Training.  Coverage will support the mission and concept of operations of the squadron, incorporating appropriate portions  of AFTTP  3-1  and AFTTP  3-3. F-16.

Upon  satisfactory  completion  of  this  mission,  the SQ/CC can certify the pilot to LOWAT Category III. 6.14.  Operational  Reconnaissance  (OPS  Recce).  OPS  Reconnaissance  is  a  RAP  special capability  to  support  unit  DOC  requirements  or  AEF  tasking.    The  minimum  requirement  for pilot  training  is  academics.    Conduct  familiarization  training  in  a  compatible  simulator  if resources  are  available.    If  excess  sorties  are  available,  a  familiarization  flight  (during  a  RAP mission)  is  desired  to  assist  training  maintenance  and  intel  personnel.    Unless  directed  by  the SQ/CC, no dedicated flight training is required. (T-3). 6.15.  F-16  Block  Differences  Training.  To train between all variants of the F-16, pilots must be  current  and  qualified  prior  to  beginning  training.    Using  AFI11-202V1  definitions,  CCIP aircraft  conversion  requires  differences  training  only;  out-of-cycle  checkrides  are  not  required. (T-3). 6.15.1.  Academics.  Academic instruction will be tailored to the pilot's previous experience and  will  concentrate  on  the  differences  between  the  two  blocks.    Instruction  will  address avionics system, electrical systems,  engine differences (as applicable), flight control system differences (including  departure susceptiblity), EPs,  OBOGS normal  and emergency operation  (if transitioning from a  LOX equipped A/C), both A/A and A/G radar modes, and cockpit layouts.  If available, an AETC formal  course  (such  as  Blk  50  course)  meets  the  requirements  for  academics  and  device training. (T-3). (as  applicable),  aircraft  handling  characteristics 6.15.2.  Device  Training.  Pilots  will  receive  simulator  training  as  required  by  previous experience. This simulator will include systems EPs, practice instrument procedures, review of  radar  and  intercept  procedures,  review  of  air-to-ground  systems,  and  CAPs.    Pilots assigned/attached  to  units  without  concurrent  simulators  will  substitute  two  SEPTs  for  the simulator (T-3). 6.15.3.  Flying Training.  Block differences training may be conducted during MQT.  Pilots who  do  not  require  MQT  will  receive  one  supervised  aircraft  sortie.    Flight  briefing  will stress cockpit procedures and employment techniques. (T-3). 6.16.  Contingency/Exercise  Spin-Up  Training.  This  training  will  be  conducted  prior  to support  of  contingency  operations  (if  time  permits)  or  exercises  (T-2).  The  objective  of  this training is to ensure the pilot's ability to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking.  For contingency  operations,  units appropriate  gaining responsible are for contacting AFI11-2F-16V1  20 APRIL 2015   69  command/operations  to  determine  expected  mission  taskings.    For  exercises,  units  are responsible  for  referring  to  appropriate  EXPLANS  and  contacting  appropriate  exercise  POCs prior  to  deployment  to  determine  expected  mission  taskings.    These  EXPLANS  include COMACC  EXPLAN  80  for  Red,  Maple,  and  Coalition  Flags,  EXPLAN  323  for  Green  Flag  - West,  and  EXPLAN  163  for  Green  Flag  -  East.  This  assures  the  units  are  prepared  for  the appropriate  tasking  and  allows  the  responding  OG/CC  to  tailor  this  training  for  the  theater, threat,  and tactics for the assigned task.   The SQ/CC is  then responsible for implementation  of this  spin-up,  prosecuting  the  required  missions,  and  determining  the  specific  requirements necessary to reach the desired level of proficiency.  Emphasis will be placed on training needed for missions not accomplished in daily operations.  (T-3). 6.16.1.  If a pilot is not assigned to the tasked squadron, they must receive spin-up training as determined  by  the  tasked  SQ/CC  (T-3).  This  applies  to  all  attached  pilots  (OG/WG/HQ staffs,  etc.),  and  all  pilots  augmenting  from  other  squadrons  (operational,  FTU,  weapons school,  test,  etc.).    The  objective  of  this  training  is  to  ensure  attached/augmenting  pilot  is proficient to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking.  The deploying SQ/CC will determine the amount of spin-up training required for each attached/augmenting pilot based on the pilot's level  of proficiency, currency, qualification, experience,  etc.   For  augmenting pilots,  once  the  amount  of  spin-up  training  is  determined,  the  augmentee's  SQ/CC  is responsible for ensuring the spin-up training is accomplished (T-3). 6.16.2.  Ground Training.  All applicable pilots will complete ground training as necessary prior to their support of contingency operations or exercises (T-2). 6.16.2.1.  Academics.  Units  will  brief  exercise  SPINS,  ROE/Training  Rules,  command and  control,  engagement  authority  and  procedures,  and  visual  identification  (T-2).

The event includes skills necessary to search for, and  engage  offensively,  an  aerial  target  at  low  altitude  with  and  without  ATP.    Only  one event may be logged per mission.  Accomplishing this event updates LOWAT currency. A2.1.36.  Low  Air-to-Ground  (LOW  A/G)  Event.  An  event  defined  as  performing realistic,  mission-oriented  low  altitude  operations  while  at  or  below  1000  feet  AGL  to  the pilot’s  qualified  minimum  altitude  block  (see  Table  6.1).    The  event  includes  low  altitude navigation, tactical formation, defensive maneuvering to avoid or negate threats, and air-to-surface  attacks.    Only  one  event  may  be  logged  per  mission.    Accomplishing  this  event updates LOWAT currency. A2.1.37.  Low/Slow  Speed  Threat  VID  Intercept  Event.  Tactical  intercept  performed  to accomplish the tactical objective (ID the bogey, ID and kill the bandit, etc) on a target below 5000 feet AGL with airspeed less than 250 KIAS.  Fighter should counter threat maneuvers and  weapons  engagement  zones,  consider  environmental  factors,  attain  turning  room  and energy at  end game, practice ID/ROE procedures, and terminate when briefed objectives or training  rule  stops  are  reached.    These  intercepts  will  not  update  ACBT  currency.    Two events  may  be  logged  per  mission,  but  not  on  the  same  engagement.    Units  assigned  the ACA/ONE  mission  will  accomplish  low/slow  VID  intercepts  with  TGP/ATP  to  assist  in VID, shadow, and weapons employment. A2.1.38.  Moving  Target  LGB  Attack  Event.

A  sortie  planned  and  launched  as  a  training  mission,  test mission, basic skills sortie, or collateral sortie that, due to some circumstance (weather, IFE, maintenance,  etc.),  fails  to  accomplish  a  sufficient  number  of  planned  events.    While maintenance  statistics  support  historical  data  for  sorties  that  are  cancelled  before  takeoff,  a non-effective  sortie  or  “air  abort”  is  not  usually  captured  by  maintenance  for  future  flying hour  programming.    These  sorties  must  be  accounted  for  in  building  unit  flying  hour programs. A2.1.43.  NVG  LOW  ALT  Event  (ANG:  N/A)  Event  is  defined  as  performing  realistic, mission  oriented  low  altitude  NVG  operations  below  the  MSA  during  high-illumination.

A2.1.45.  Red Air Mission.  A/A mission where tactics, aircraft simulation, weapon systems, and/or  maneuvering  is  limited  to  the  extent  that  complete  own  MDS  training  is  not accomplished.  Restrictions  which  limit  aircraft  capabilities  to  some  level  which  might  be encountered in combat do not require logging the mission as Red Air.  For CMR pilots, Red Air  mission  allocations  in  the  RTM  are  a  maximum  cap  on  degraded  training.  Red  air missions toward  RAP  mission requirements/lookback.  However,  CMR  pilots  may  accomplish  individual  events  (e.g. formation landing, AAR, etc.) and update applicable currencies. Unused Red Air allocations should be flown in one of the other A/A training mission categories. flown  above  max  allocation  do  not  count A2.1.46.  SEAD  Mission.  Mission  designed  to  develop  proficiency  in  Suppression  of Enemy Air Defense tactics.

A penalty directed to a specific aircraft and pilot for actions inconsistent with established  procedures  or  safety  considerations.    One  foul  results  in  a  gross  error  for  that delivery.    Two  fouls  or  any  dangerous  pass  will  result  in  mandatory  expulsion  from  any further  deliveries  during  that  mission  and  a  gross  error  score  for  the  event.  A  foul  will  be charged IAW flying directive publications. Do not use verbal warnings instead of fouls. A2.2.4.  Gross  Error.  A  penalty  score  or  miss  assigned  to  an  aircrew's  records  when  a weapons delivery attempt results in: munitions impact outside the range scoring capability; a chargeable dry pass; a  foul; an unintentional  release;  or exceeding tactical  delivery time on final requirements.
