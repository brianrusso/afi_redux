Official  Use  of  GMVs:  GMVs  are  closely  controlled  because  of  their  easy  accessibility, high visibility and potential for misuse.  DoDM 4500.36 implements federal law (e.g., 31 U.S.C. §1344  Passenger  Carrier  Use  and  40  U.S.C.  §§601-611,  Motor  Vehicle  Pools  and Transportation  Systems)  and  prescribes  the  limited  use  of  GMVs  to  official  governmental purposes.    Unauthorized  use  of  GMVs  results  in  unnecessary  expenditure  of  funds  and  creates public  criticism.    Commanders,  vehicle  operators  and  the  base  populace  must  be  familiar  with vehicle use restrictions and what constitutes official use.  (T-0). 3.1.1.  Initial/Annual  Training  Requirement:   The  unit  VCO,  or  commanders  with permanently assigned GMVs will brief their personnel on Air Force policy regarding official use, accident reporting procedures, vehicle abuse, discrepancy reporting, proper backing/use of  spotters  and  use  of  DD  Form  518,  Accident  Identification  Card,  SF  91,  Motor  Vehicle Accident  Report  and  SF  94,  Statement  of  Witness,  annually.

Restrict use of all GMVs, including those rented or leased, for official purposes only, e.g., in support of authorized DoD functions, activities, or operations only.  (T-0). 3.1.3.  GMVs  will  not  be  provided  solely  or  principally  to  enhance  the  comfort  or convenience of member(s).  (T-0). 3.1.4.  Transportation by a GMV shall not be provided when the justification is based solely on reasons of rank, position, prestige or personal convenience.  (T-0). 3.1.5.  GMVs will not be authorized for transporting DoD or other personnel over all or any part of the route between their domiciles and places of employment except as authorized in this AFI.  (T-0). 3.1.6.  When questions arise about the official use of an GMV, they will be resolved in favor of strict compliance with statutory provisions and this guidance.  (T-0).  Refer requests which appear  to  conflict  with  governing  directives  to  the  Vehicle  Operations  Element  NCOIC  for review.  The servicing legal office also serves as a valuable resource in aiding commanders in their determinations. 3.1.7.  In  the  National  Capital  Region  (NCR),  Administrative  Instruction  109  takes precedence. Section 3B—General Operator Responsibilities  3.2.  General Use Responsibilities: 3.2.1.  Alcoholic  beverages  will  not  be  consumed  in  GMVs.    (T-0).    Operators  will  not consume alcohol 8 hours prior to duty or prior to operating any GMVs.  (T-0).  Operators are 24 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 ultimately responsible for exercising good judgment by imposing additional time constraints as needed. 3.2.2.  Use  of  personal  or  government-issued  hand-held  wireless  phones  or  text  messaging equipment or any other type of electronic devices will not be used while operating a GMV.  (T-0).    The  use  of  hands-free  communication  equipment  (blue-tooth  enabled  vehicles, speakerphones,  single-bud  earphones,  mounted  phones,  etc.)  may  be  used  IAW  applicable local laws. 3.2.3.  Tobacco products will not be used in GMVs.  (T-0). 3.2.4.  Food will not be consumed while operating a GMV.  (T-0). 3.3.  Making Official Use Determinations:  When questions arise about the use of GMVs, they shall be resolved in favor of strict compliance with statutory provisions and the policies of this instruction.  (T-0).  When guidance does not specifically fit a request for transportation support, commanders must document answers to the following questions prior to approving the use of a government motor vehicle:  (T-0). 3.3.1.  The  purpose  of  the  vehicle  use  must  be  essential  to  the  successful  completion  of  a DoD function, activity, or operation.  (T-0). 3.3.2.  The  purpose  of  the  vehicle  use  must  be  consistent  with  the  purpose  for  which  the GMV was acquired.  (T-0). 3.3.3.  If provided, the GMV transportation used must be the most cost effective method of satisfying the requirement, consistent with paragraph 3.4. ictect(T-0). 3.4.  Priority  of  Transportation  Services:  When  vehicle  transportation  is  essential  to  the performance of official business, the following methods shall be considered in the order shown to the extent they are available and capable of meeting mission requirements:  (T-0). 3.4.1.  Scheduled DoD bus service. 3.4.2.  DoD specially scheduled leased or owned bus service. 3.4.3.  Van pools. 3.4.4.  GMV  centrally  dispatched  “taxicab”  operation.  (Example:  Operator  and  Vehicle support requested from Vehicle Operations) 3.4.5.  GMV individually dispatched to licensed service member or civilian employee. (Example: Unit assigned vehicle or U-Drive-It from Vehicle Operations) Section 3C—Installation Misuse Program 3.5.  Vehicle  Misuse  Reporting:  Report  suspected  misuses  to  LRS  Vehicle  Operations.  Vehicle  Operations  conducts  an  initial  technical  assessment  of  the  incident  to  determine  if regulatory  official  use  guidance  may  have  been  violated.    Note:    AF/A4LR  will  serve  as  the primary point of contact for misuses or reckless vehicle operation allegations reported to  GSA.  (T-1). 3.5.1.  Vehicle Operations will collect the information and conduct a technical assessment for review.  (T-1).  Technical assessments will include at a minimum the date, time and location AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 25 of  incident  as  well  as  the  vehicle’s  make,  model  and  vehicle  registration  number.    (T-1).  Technical  assessments  will  also  clearly  state  the  alleged  offense  and  applicable  official  use guidance addressed in the suspected misuse.  (T-1). 3.5.2.  Forward  allegations  along  with  the  technical  assessment  to  the  LRS  commander within 5 duty days of receiving the complaint.  The LRS commander will forward suspected misuse  technical  assessment  requiring  investigation  to  the  appropriate  unit  commander within 5 duty days of receipt.  (T-1).  Commanders have 15 calendar days to respond to the LRS  commander's  assessment  and  identify  actions  taken  to  prevent  further  occurrences  (if appropriate).    Unit  commander  responses  will  include  address  requirements  identified  in paragraph 3.3.  (T-1). 3.5.3.  Vehicle Operations will maintain a log of reported misuse cases.  (T-1).  The misuse log with technical assessments and unit responses will be kept on file for 6 years (RDS:  T24-03R1300).  (T-1). 3.5.4.  Annually,  the  LRS  commander  will  provide  their  respective  group  commander  with detailed investigations  with recommendations to improve official use of GMVs.  (T-1). results  of  pending  and  completed  vehicle  misuse 3.5.5.  Vehicle  Operations  will  provide  a  copy  of  the  annual  unit  misuse  data  to  VM&A Vehicle Control Program (VCP) for dissemination to unit VCOs.  (T-1). 3.6.  Penalties  for  Misuse  of  DoD  Motor  Vehicles:  Misuse  or  acts/omissions  resulting  in misuse of GMVs (owned, rented, or leased) may result in disciplinary action.  All military and civilian  employees  need  to  take  appropriate  measures  to  prevent  misuse,  abuse  or  willful acts/omissions  that  could  cause  damage  to  GMVs.    Directing  personnel  to  violate  official  use restrictions  is  an  unlawful  order  and  should  be  reported  to  command  or  other  appropriate agencies.    DoDM  4500.36,  Enclosure  5,  provides  specific  guidance  regarding  penalties  for misuse. Section 3D—Authorized Uses of GMVs for Temporary Duty Support 3.7.  Temporary Duty:  Transportation may be provided between lodgings and duty stations for personnel  on  temporary  duty  when  public  or  commercial  resources  are  inadequate  or nonexistent.  The temporary duty status of an individual does not necessarily justify the use of a GMV or its use for personal convenience.  Use of the vehicle will always be predicated on need, distance  involved,  and  other  conditions  that  justify  their  use  to  further  the  DoD  and  Air  Force mission.  (T-0).  Note:  See Chapter 5 for alternative transportation support for TDY personnel.  When an adequate DoD or commercial bus system is available or can be provided, the use of any individual motor vehicle or commercial rental car is prohibited.  When authorized, a GMV may be used for: 3.7.1.  Sustenance:    Between  places  of  business  or  lodging  and  eating  establishments, pharmacy,  barber  shops,  places  of  worship,  laundry  cleaning  establishments  and  similar places required for sustenance of the member whether on- or off-base.   If used off-base for sustenance,  restrict  GMV  use  to  reputable  establishments  in  reasonable  proximity  to  the installation.  (T-0). 3.7.1.1.  Reasonable  proximity  will  be  established  in  the  installation  commander’s official  use  policy.  (T-1).    A  one-way  distance  of  5  miles  should  be  used  as  a  guide.  26 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 Reputable is defined as an establishment that will not create a perception that will reflect unfavorably on the DoD or Air Force or cause public criticism no matter what the venue is.  (T-1). 3.7.1.2.  GMVs will not be taken to adult-oriented/themed establishments.  (T-1). 3.7.2.  Entertainment  and  Morale:    Between  places  of  business  or  lodging  and  local installation  bowling  centers,  officer/enlisted/all-ranks  clubs,  gymnasiums  or  any  on-base NAF  activity  (i.e.,  golf  courses,  rod  &  gun  clubs,  and  theaters)  facilities  required  for  the comfort  or  health  of  the  member.    The  use  of  GMVs  for  transportation  to  any  off-base entertainment  or  recreational  facilities,  to  include  those  on  other  installations  is  prohibited.  (T-0).    Installation  commanders  may  authorize  an  exception  for  situations  where  the installation  does  not  have  a  fitness  center  and  designated  gymnasium  is  on  another installation or in local community per Community Partnership agreement.  (T-0). 3.7.3.  IAW  AFI  32-6003,  General  Officer  Quarters,  Special  Command  Position  (SCP) housing  is  occupied  by  a  general  officer  or  civilian  equivalent  and  carries  public entertainment responsibilities requiring the incumbent to represent the interests of the United States in official and social activities involving foreign and domestic dignitaries.  GMV use by TDY personnel (to include ITA travelers as passengers) to attend these official events is authorized.  Special Command Position housing will be identified in the installation’s official use policy.  (T-1).  Installation Protocol office will be the point of contact for official events.  (T-1). Section 3E—Standard Authorized Uses of GMVs for Permanent Party Mission Support 3.8.  Permanent  Party:  The  purpose  of  the  vehicle  use  must  be  essential  to  the  successful completion  of  a  DoD  function,  activity,  or  operation.    (T-0).    Official  use  for  active  duty personnel includes transportation to or from  Air Force scheduled appointments on- or off-base, e.g., MPS records check, dental appointments, commander’s calls (special consideration must be taken  to  prevent  transportation  that  circumvent  official  use  rules  for  purposes  of  morale  or personal  convenience),  urinalysis  testing  and  hospital  outpatient  appointments.    (T-1).    GMV travel is not authorized for elective surgery, procedures or treatments where the member would otherwise  not  be  entitled  to  government  travel.    Use  transportation  priorities  specified  in paragraph  3.6 3.8.1.  Permanent Party personnel conducting official off-base duties are authorized to stop at off-base eating establishments in the immediate vicinity or direct route of the off-base work site.    Stopping  at  (on  or  off-base)  private  quarters  for  any  reason  or  stopping  for shopping/personal  convenience  purposes  is  prohibited.    The  intent  is  to  allow  for  those personnel  working  away  from  their  duty  location,  for  extended  periods,  the  opportunity  to obtain  meals  without  incurring  an  additional  time/fuel  cost  of  returning  to  the  installation.  This is not to be taken as authority to stop as a matter of personal convenience when in transit between sites, whether on- or off-base. 3.8.2.  Personnel  conducting  official  off-base  duties  are  authorized  to  respond  to  personal emergencies  that  may  arise  while  they  are  conducting  off-base  duties  in  a  GMV.    Personal emergencies are defined as notification of a life threatening or serious injury to themselves or a dependent or substantial damage to personal property, such as a home fire.  Example:  Off-AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 27 base  personnel  with  a  GMV  receives  notification,  at  that  time,  of  a  personal  emergency.  Personnel  may  respond  as  it  is  more  time  and  cost  effective  for  the  Air  Force  to  have  the individual proceed to  the emergency event  directly  (home, school,  hospital,  accident scene) rather than return to the installation/duty location to retrieve their personal vehicle.  The unit commander will notify the LRS commander any time these actions have been exercised and take actions to have the GMV returned at the earliest opportunity.  (T-0). 3.8.3.  Commercial  Terminal  Transportation:    Use  of  resources  to  support  administrative activities, for which sufficient public transportation or commercial services exist to fulfill the need, detracts from direct mission support and should be avoided.  To that end and as defined elsewhere  in  this  publication,  other,  more  cost  effective  and  responsive  means  of transportation  will  be  utilized  to  support  administrative  activities  such  as  commercial terminal  transportation.    (T-1).    (Note:    Terminal  transportation  is  not  authorized  in  the National  Capital  Region  (NCR)  and  Pentagon  Area  IAW  DoD  Administrative  Instruction 109, Use of Motor Transportation and Scheduled DoD Shuttle Service in the Pentagon Area.  See AFDW/A4T for specific guidance). 3.8.3.1.  Transportation  between  domicile  or  place  of  employment  and  commercial transportation terminals is authorized when at least one of the conditions is met: 3.8.3.1.1.  Individual  is  normally  authorized  transportation  between  domicile  and place  of  employment  (Domicile-to-Duty).    Personnel  authorized  domicile-to-duty transportation may elect to share space in a GMV with other individuals on a space-available basis provided the GMV does not travel additional distances as a result. 3.8.3.1.2.  Necessary  because  of  emergency  situations  or requirements. to  meet  security 3.8.3.1.3.  Terminals  are  located  in  areas  where  other  methods  of  transportation cannot  meet  mission  requirements  in  a  responsive  manner.    Note:    See  glossary  for guidance on determining responsiveness. 3.8.3.2.  Official  non-DoD  visitors  when  officially  invited  and  approved  by  the installation  commander  or  other  competent  authority  (delegated  in-writing  by  the installation commander), may be provided GMV support, fare-free between commercial transportation  terminals  and  visitation  point  (limited  to  local  area  travel)  to  take  part  in base activities in the interest of community relations. 3.8.3.3.  Terminal  transportation  will  be  addressed  in  the  installation  official  use  policy and include provisions to ensure support is not based solely on reasons of rank, position, prestige or personal convenience.  (T-0). 3.8.3.4.  Use  of  GMVs  for  terminal  transportation  must  be  the  most  cost  effective  and efficient  service  consistent  with  paragraph  3.4  and  without  deterring  the  primary mission.  (T-0). 3.8.3.5.  When terminal transportation has been authorized, a cost benefit analysis will be conducted during the semiannual analysis.  (T-1).  See Table 2.1 3.9.  Event Participation: 3.9.1.  Public  Ceremonies:    The  use  of  GMVs  may  be  authorized  for  military  and  civilian personnel  officially  participating  in  public  ceremonies,  military  field  demonstrations,  and 28 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 parades directly related to official  activities.  “Official participation” is defined as activities similar  to  and  including:    Presiding  Officer,  Host,  Chaplain,  Master  of  Ceremonies,  Guest Speaker  (to  include  Congressional  Medal  of  Honor  recipients,  prior  General  Officers  and CMSAF  etc.)  and  Proffer.    Attendance  does  not  constitute  “officially  participating”  even  if the public ceremony has been established as an alternate duty location. 3.9.2.  Formal  Air  Force  Ceremonies:    The  use  of  GMVs  for  general  military  and  civilian invitee  participation  and  attendance  at  official  AF  ceremonies  (limited  to  changes  of command, promotions, graduations, retirements, unit activation, and inactivation) held on an AF installation and not open to the public may be authorized by the installation commander.  Support  for  personnel  who  have  no  official  role  in  the  event  (i.e.,  general  invitees)  will  be within the confines of the installation and be limited to those situations where circumstances require shuttle transportation from general parking location, maximizing centralized parking.  (T-1).  Support will be in compliance with the priorities identified earlier in this chapter and may not conflict with mission requirements.  (T-1). 3.9.2.1.  Support  will  begin  and  end  at  officially  designated  areas,  not  a  personal residence/domicile.    (T-1).    This  is  not  to  be  interpreted  as  authority  to  transport personnel by other than authorized shuttle service. 3.9.2.2.  Support will be limited to official AF ceremonies and will not extend to socials or  pre-/post-event  activities.    (T-1).    It  is  the  responsibility  of  leaders  at  all  levels  to monitor  and  correct  abuse  of  this  policy.  Characterization  of  an  event  as  an  “official ceremony” for purposes of this paragraph does not create an entitlement to other forms of support  or  funding  for  the  ceremony;  such  support  must  be  established  and  justified  by the appropriate authority.  (T-1). 3.9.3.  Except  as  expressly  provided  in  paragraph  3.9.2.  using  general  shuttle  support, neither  paragraph  3.9.1.  nor    3.9.2  provides  authority  to  transport  a  member’s  relatives  or personal  friends  invited  to  attend  activities  such  as  retirements,  promotions,  awards ceremonies,  dedications,  funerals  or  any  other  similar  type  functions.    Determinations regarding any question of authorized support for such activities will be resolved in favor of strict  compliance  with  rules  outlined  in  this  instruction  to  preclude  any  negative  public perception.  (T-0). 3.9.4.  General shuttle support from centralized  parking may be used as a mitigation step to vulnerability assessments IAW AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism. 3.9.5.  The use of GMVs is authorized to transport immediate family members of the sponsor in  situations  involving  a  sponsor’s  death.    The  LRS  commander  is  the  approval  authority.  (T-0). Section 3F—Special Authorized Uses of GMVs for Permanent Party Mission Support 3.10.  Mission-Specific Authorizations:  Certain mission-specific allowances may be approved by the installation commander in the installation’s official use policy, see Chapter 1.  Units will submit  requests/justification  to  the  DDF.    (T-1).  The  consolidated  package  with  the  LRS commander’s recommendations will be coordinated thru the installation judge advocate and then to  the  installation  commander  for  final  approval.    (T-1).    Approval  determinations  will  be AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 29 provided to each requesting unit commander and VCO.  (T-1).  Mission-specific authorizations will be limited to:  (T-0). 3.10.1.  Emergency  Response  Forces:    The  installation  commander  may  approve  use  of GMVs  by  emergency  response  forces  (first-responders)  for  travel  to  on-base  eating establishments and base gymnasium when on alert status.  This approval may include the use of  Military  Dining  Facilities  and  NAF/AAFES/DECA  operated  eating  establishments  to include commissary and shoppette.  The intent is to afford personnel to remain on duty and maintain the ability for immediate response while securing meals for health and sustenance.  Do  not  grant  any  of  the  above  authorities  for  the  personal  convenience  of  members.  Leadership  within  units  authorized  to  travel  to  on-base  eating  establishment  must  ensure personnel do not abuse or cause negative public perception by frequenting establishments for reasons other than obtaining meals.   (T-1).  Personnel are prohibited from using GMVs for travel to and from their private quarters under this provision. 3.10.2.  The installation commander may approve use of GMVs for the purposes of securing carry-out meals in bulk from on-base military dining facilities or flight kitchens.  Examples include: Aircrew, Passenger Terminal, and Mobility/Contingency support.  Do not grant any of the above authorities for the personal convenience of members. 3.10.3.  Unless specifically authorized in another section of this instruction, Air Force GMVs will not be used to transport personnel or equipment to or from base housing areas or other private quarters located either on or off the installation.  (T-0). 3.10.4.  Mission-specific  authorizations    will  not  be  extended  to  activities  other  than  those listed in paragraph 3.10.  (T-0). 3.11.  Operations  Group  Commanders  (OG/CCs):  When  a  telecommunications  equipped, permanently  assigned  vehicle  is  authorized,  OG/CCs  may  drive  that  GMV  to  on-base  eating establishments (Military  Dining  Facilities  and  NAF/AAFES/DECA  operated  eating establishments to include commissary and shoppette) while preforming their duties in connection with on-going flight operations.  The intent of the policy is to allow OG/CCs to use the assigned GMV  for  these  activities  while  maintaining  access  to  mounted  telecommunications  equipment.  This shall not to be interpreted as authority to use the GMV for stops at their residence or other domicile-to-duty transportation.  (T-0). 3.12.  Command  and  Control  Vehicle telecommunications-equipped, emergency  configured  non-tactical  GMVs  may  be  provided  on  a  24-hour-a-day  basis  to commanders  who  are  charged  by  the  DoD  Component  head  concerned  or  the  Chairman  of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the overall sole responsibility for security or operational function of an installation or major military organization. (CACV):  Radio 3.13.  Approval  Authority for CACV:  CACV use is limited to commanders with overall sole responsibility  for  operations  or  installation  security  who  cannot  adequately  discharge  this responsibility without a 24-hour mobility and communication capability.  The respective parent MAJCOM  commander  (no  lower  than  a  2-star  flag  officer  or  equivalent)  is  the  approval authority for CACV use.  (T-0). 3.13.1.  Units  requesting  CACV  approval  must  coordinate  with  the  host  installation  and AFIMSC prior to requesting approval through their parent MAJCOM commander.  (T-1). 30 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 3.13.2.  CACV  authorizations  will  be  revalidated  biennially  on  odd  number  years,  IAW procedures outlined above, NLT 30 October.  (T-1). 3.13.3.  AFIMSC,  NGB  and  AFRC  will  compile  a  listing  of  all  CACV  authorizations  and forward  their  list  of  approved/validated  CACV  authorizations  to  HQ  USAF/A4LR.    (T-1).  Out of cycle requests are authorized, but will be re-authorized during the biennial, odd-year revalidation.  (T-1). 3.14.  Request  and  Justification  for  CACV:  IAW  DoD  guidance,  justifications  must  include an  affirmative  response  and  explanation  to  each  of  the  questions  cited  below  before  CACV authority  may  be  granted.    (T-0).    Installation  commanders  or  key  command  positions  that cannot answer affirmatively to paragraphs  3.14.1 through  3.14.6 will not be authorized to use GMVs as outlined in paragraph 3.15. (T-0). 3.14.1.  Does  the  commander  have  sole  operational  responsibility  for  a  flying,  combat, combat support, installation security, wartime or contingency mission? 3.14.2.  Is  it  unreasonable  to  expect  the  commander  to  discharge  his  or  her  duties  without dedicated, full-time mobility (e.g., the vehicle remains available to the commander on a 24-hour,  full-time  basis)  and  an  immediate  means  to  communicate  with  a  duty  office  or command post, aircraft, or operational combat sites? 3.14.3.  With  the  possible  exception  of  the  installation  commander,  is  the  requesting commander  the  only  person  in  the  vertical  chain  of  command  designated  to  require  a command and control vehicle? 3.14.4.  Is an acting commander specifically required and designated when the commander is absent from duty? 3.14.5.  In  cases  where  a  duty  office  or  command  post  has  been  established  to  handle emergency  response  actions,  is  there  any  reason  why  that  duty  office  or  command  post cannot manage an emergency until the commander arrives by privately owned conveyance? 3.14.6.  Can  it  be  substantiated  that  the  commander  cannot  adequately  discharge  duties outside  of  normal  duty  hours  with  a  privately  owned  vehicle  and  a  non-tactical  portable communication device instead of a radio-equipped, emergency-configured vehicle? 3.15.  CACV  Use:  Use  of  command  and  control  vehicles  is  authorized  for  on-base  travel  to locations/tasks  related  to  personal  health  and  sustenance  (except  member’s  residence).    This authorization  accommodates  the  commander’s  responsibility  to  assure  an  immediate  response and communications capability.  Permanent  party official  use rules  (paragraph  3.8)  apply  for off-base travel and stops.  All other official use constraints as described in this chapter, including the provisions on dependent and family member travel, apply to command and control vehicles. 3.15.1.  CACVs  do  not  denote  domicile-to-duty  transportation.    If  a  requirement  for domicile-to-duty travel exists, procedures must be followed in Chapter 4.  (T-0). 3.15.2.  In  case  of  leave  or  extended  absence  from  the  installation,  the  commander  passes CACV  authority  to  the  individual  assuming  the  responsibility.    CACVs  are  considered equipment  assigned  to  specific  commanders  which  allow  maximum  response  flexibility  in executing their assigned duties. AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 31 3.15.3.  IAW this determination, commanders will use assigned CACVs for transport to/from off-base  commercial  transportation  terminals  only  when  use  is  critical  to  ongoing  missions (e.g.,  use  of  specialized  communications  equipment  installed  in  the  CACV  required  while commander is  en-route to/from  off-base commercial transportation terminal).   (T-1).   In all other instances, commanders with CACV authority are provided the same level of service as other installation personnel. Section 3G—Air Force Band Transportation Support (AFI 35-110, US Air Force Band Program) 3.16.  Air  Force  Band  Transportation  Support:  Vehicle  Allowance  Standards  authorize intercity  buses  to  installations  supporting  Air  Force  bands.    Buses  will  be  authorized  and assigned to Vehicle Operations with the band as the primary user.  (T-1). 3.16.1.  When Air Force owned intercity buses are not available to meet band requirements, the base LRS must arrange adequate alternative transportation, to include commercial charter buses.  (T-0).  The Air Force band funds commercial charter buses. 3.16.2.  The  band  pays  all  TDY  expenses  for  Vehicle  Operations  personnel  providing operator support. 3.16.3.  Buses may be used for other transportation needs when no band requirements exist. Section 3H—Dependent and Pet Transportation Support 3.17.  General  Dependent  Transportation  Support:  Transportation of family members is the responsibility  of  the  sponsor.    Spouses  are  not  considered  representatives  of  the  United  States, DoD,  or  Air  Force,  except  when  traveling  on  an  approved  Invitational  Travel  Authorization (ITA) (see paragraph 3.18). 3.17.1.  Military  member  or  civilian  employee’s  spouses/dependents  may  be  transported  in GMVs only when: 3.17.1.1.  On  a  space  available  basis,  accompanying  the  military  member  or  civilian employee  in  the  GMV  for  which  the  use  of  the  vehicle  has  already  been  authorized  to accomplish the official business.  Transportation will be provided at no additional cost to the  government.    (T-0).    The  vehicle  must  be  no  larger  than  required  for  the  official business.  (T-0). 3.17.1.2.  On a space available basis, dependents may use publicized, regularly scheduled shuttle buses or mass transportation services. 3.17.1.3.  Spouses  of  employees  who  are  authorized  to  receive  domicile-to-duty transportation may proceed independently to or from an official function in a GMV when the dependent's presence at the function is in the best interest of the government. 3.18.  Invitational  Travel  Authorization (ITA)  Special  Dependent  Transportation Support:  Spouses on official ITA orders are authorized ground transportation in direct support of the invitation only, e.g., travel to/from transportation terminal, billets, and event site(s). 3.18.1.  AF  and  MAJCOM  pre-command  training  (e.g.,  squadron,  group,  wing,  and  Senior Leader  {General  Officers  and  Senior  Executive  Service}  Orientation  courses)  will  be 32 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 supported for the training event only.  (T-1).  Support is not authorized for off-base events, to include tours, site visits, luncheons, social gatherings, etc.  Support will be limited to official event participation.  (T-1).  Commercial terminal support is authorized on a space-available basis and IAW the local official use policy. 3.18.2.  All  other  commanders’  (MAJCOM,  NAF,  Wing,  and  Group)  spouse  installation visits  are not  authorized  official  transportation unless on  ITA orders.   This includes spouse base  orientation  tours,  civic  events,  and  area  tours.    Spouses  may  accompany  on  a  space-available  basis.    Larger  vehicles  will  not  be  provided  to  accommodate  space-available passengers.  (T-1). 3.18.3.  Local  commanders’  spouse  transportation  will  only  be  authorized  when  at  no  cost and  only  on  a  space-available  basis  when  accompanying  the  member  to/from  the  official events (e.g., change of commands, retirements, etc.).  (T-1).  No separate itineraries, tours, or transportation are authorized (e.g., shopping trips, luncheons, museum, or landmark tours). 3.19.  Pet/Service Animal Transportation Support: 3.19.1.  The  use  of  GMVs  for  the  transportation  of  family  pets  is  authorized  for  PCS  (only pertains  to  PCS  moves  at  austere  locations  where  public  or  private  transportation  is  not available), 10-2 CEMP, NEO, SAFEHAVEN, etc.  The pet must always be under the control of  the  owner,  either  leashed  or  caged,  in  order  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the  driver  and passengers.    (T-1).    Owners  will  be  held  responsible  for  the  behavior  of  their  pets  and  any costs associated to damage caused by the pet.  (T-1). 3.19.2.  Service  animals  are  authorized  to  accompany  the  individual  requiring  support  in GMVs.  The service animal must always be under the control of the owner, either leashed or harnessed,  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the  driver  and  passengers.    (T-1).    Owners  will  be  held responsible for the behavior of their service animal and any cost associated to damage caused by the animal.  (T-1).

(T-0). 4.4.2.  The comfort and convenience of an official will not be considered justification for the approval of DTD transportation.  (T-0). Section 4B—Field Work and Intelligence Transportation Support: 4.5.  Field  Work:  The  SecAF  determines  who  is  eligible  to  use  DTD  transportation  for  field work.    IAW  41  C.F.R.  §102-5.30,  Public  Contracts  and  Property  Management,  field  work means  official  work  performed  by  an  employee  whose  job  requires  travel  involving  multiple stops  within  or  outside  the  accepted  local  commuting  area.    AFIMSC,  NGB  or  AFRC  should consider requesting DTD authorization only under compelling operational circumstances.  Some examples of field work include: 4.5.1.  Medical  officers  performing  outpatient  medical  service  away  from  a  hospital.  Updated and approved biennially by 30 Oct on even-number years. 4.5.2.  Military  recruiters  who  proceed  directly  from  their  domiciles  to  conduct  official recruiting  matters,  verses  driving  to  where  the  GMV  is  normally  garaged.    Updated  and approved biennially by 30 Oct on even-number years. 4.5.3.  Do not use the DTD field-work exception when: 4.5.3.1.  The individual’s workday begins at his or her official government duty station. 4.5.3.2.  The  individual  normally  commutes  to  a  fixed  location,  however  far  removed from his or her official duty station. 4.5.3.3.  When it is determined DTD transportation will not save at least 30 miles on the GMV  odometer  per  trip,  will  not  save  at  least  1-hour  of  duty  time  per  trip  or  will  not shorten a TDY by at least 1-day per trip.  (T-1). 4.5.4.  Assignment  of  an  individual  to  a  field-work  authorized  DTD  positions  does  not  in itself entitle the individual to receive daily DTD transportation.  Requests to use GMVs for DTD  must  be  approved  by  the  squadron  commander  (or  equivalent)  or  higher  chain  of command.  (T-1). 4.6.  Intelligence  and  Law  Enforcement  Transportation  Support:  The  SecAF  determines who  is  eligible  to  use  DTD  based  on  the  safety  and  the  efficient  conduct  of  individuals performing  intelligence,  counterintelligence,  protective  services,  or  law  enforcement  duties.  Updated and approved annually by 30 Oct each year.  When authorized, DTD use of GMVs will only  be  allowed  on  days  when  the  individual  is  actually  performing  official  duties  related  to intelligence, counterintelligence, protective services, or law enforcement.  (T-0). 4.7.  Approval  Procedures  for  Field  Work:  Submit  all  Air  Force  field-work  requirements biennially to HQ USAF/A4L for consolidation and submission to the SecAF for approval.  Out- of-cycle  requests  must  also  be  submitted  through  the  AFIMSC,  NGB  or  AFRC  to  HQ USAF/A4LR.  (T-0). AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 39 4.8.

Bus Transportation Services:  IAW 10 U.S.C. § 2632, Transportation to and from Certain Places  of  Employment  and  on  Military  Installations,  the  Air  Force  provides  bus  service  for official purposes and as U.S. law allows. 5.1.1.  DoD  categorizes  bus  transportation  services  as  modified  shuttle  bus  service,  shuttle bus  service,  group  transportation  service,  mass  transit  service,  emergency  bus  service  and military community activities. 5.1.2.  The  Air  Force  operates  enough  buses  to  effectively  support  the  mission.    The capability to transport groups of people on official business reduces the requirement for small passenger-carrying vehicles. 5.1.3.  Do  not  provide  this  service  to  nonessential  activities  when  private  or  commercial transportation  is  available.    The  availability  of  vehicles  and  operators  may  limit  military support. Section 5B—Categories and Administrative Requirements of GMV Bus Transportation Services 5.2.  Modified  Shuttle  Bus  Service:  The effective conduct of the affairs of the Air Force may warrant  modified  shuttle  bus  transportation  support  for  military  personnel,  DoD  civilians  and contractors  between  their  office  and  transit  centers.    A  modified  shuttle  bus  service  will  be  a passenger  carrier  (e.g.,  bus,  van),  which  is  owned,  leased  or  contracted  by  the  AF  to  transport personnel  identified  in  this  paragraph  between  their  place  of  employment  and  mass  transit facilities.  (T-0). 5.2.1.  A modified shuttle bus service may be established to meet local requirements if all of these criteria are met: 5.2.1.1.  There is no regularly scheduled mass transportation service that operates twice a day,  five  times  a  week  between  sending  or  receiving  locations  and  is  licensed  and operates IAW reasonable maintenance and safety standards. 5.2.1.2.  Other  mass  transportation  providers  are  unable  or  have  declined  to  provide adequate  transportation  facilities  or  service  after  a  reasonable  effort  has  been  made  to induce  them  to  do  so  and  coordination  has  been  made  with  other  federal  agencies  and DoD  Components  to  share  and,  otherwise  avoid  duplication  of,  transportation  services provided under this authority. 5.2.1.3.  The service enhances the rider’s quality of life. 5.2.1.4.  Vehicles  used  will  have  a  capacity  to  carry  12  or  more  riders,  including  the driver,  and  operate  at  least  50  percent  of  capacity  on  a  monthly  basis.    (T-0).    For example, service scheduled for five times a week using a 16 passenger bus would require AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 41 a minimum monthly ridership of 160 (i.e., 8 passengers X 5 days per week X 4 weeks per month) passengers to justify use. 5.2.1.5.  The installation or place of employment is a significant distance from the mass transit facility. 5.2.2.  For  the  purpose  of  this  determination,  an  individual  will  not  be  considered  in  the “performance  of  duty”  or  “acting  within  the  scope  of  his  or  her  office  or  employment”  by virtue  of  the  fact  that  such  individual  is  receiving  transportation  services  under  this authorization.    (T-0).    Nor  will  any  time  during  which  an  individual  uses  this  service  be considered when calculating the hours of work or employment for that individual.  (T-0). 5.2.3.  There will be no additional funds to defray costs of this service.  (T-0). 5.2.4.  AFIMSC/CC,  ANG/CC  or  AFRC/CC  is  the  approval  authority  for  modified  shuttle bus service.  All criteria listed in this section must be met, documented, and retained on file with the approving authority.  (T-1).  This requirement is purposefully more restrictive than guidance in DoDM 4500.36 to maintain program integrity and oversight. 5.2.4.1.  AFIMSC,  NGB  or  AFRC  and  LRS  commanders  will  ensure  a  file  copy  of  all approved services is maintained.  (T-1). 5.2.4.2.  Units  approved  to  provide  this  service  will  forward  their  analysis  to  their respective AFIMSC, NGB or AFRC NLT 15 January of each calendar year.  (T-1). 5.2.5.  Service  will  be  reviewed  during  the  semiannual  services  analysis  to  ensure  the schedule is adequate and that the most efficient form of service is provided.  (T-1). 5.3.  Shuttle Bus Service:  Provides the capability to transport groups of individuals on official business  between  offices  on  installations  or  between  nearby  installations,  is  a  recognized requirement,  and  is  essential  to  mission  support.    The  use  of  an  effective  shuttle  bus  service reduces the requirement for an assigned vehicle fleet.  Shuttle bus services are provided fare-free. 5.3.1.  Shuttle bus service may be provided for, on, or between offices and places of duty for the transportation of: 5.3.1.1.  Military  personnel  and  DoD  employees  between  offices  and  places  of  duty  on the  installations  or  activity  during  designated  hours  when  justified  by  the  ridership.  Routes  will  service  offices  and  work  centers  only.    (T-0).    Unauthorized  stops  include base  housing  areas  (to  include  government  leased  and/or  privatized  housing)  and  any recreational or shopping areas unless these areas are reasonably unavoidable.  Domicile-to-duty transportation using a shuttle service is not authorized. 5.3.1.2.  Enlisted  personnel  traveling  between  dormitories,  places  of  duty  on  the installation  or  activity  during  designated  hours  when  justified  by  the  ridership.    Do  not provide  this  service  when  other  forms  of  transportation  such  as  mass  transit,  privately owned  conveyance  or  car  or  van  pools  are  adequate  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  member.  The installation commander makes these determinations. 5.3.1.3.  DoD contractor personnel conducting official defense business. 5.3.1.4.  Employees  of  non-DoD  federal  agencies  on  official  business  on  a  space-available  basis  only.    Such  transportation  will  only  be  provided  over  routes  established for primary support of the defense mission.  (T-0). 42 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 5.3.1.5.  In  isolated  sites  with  limited  support  facilities  where  DoD  personnel  and dependents  need  additional  support  (e.g.,  medical,  commissary,  and  religious)  that directly  affects  health,  morale,  and  welfare  of  the  family,  shuttle  bus  service  may  be provided. 5.3.2.  The following guidance applies to establishing and maintaining shuttle bus routes: 5.3.2.1.  Established routes and schedules must be based on a validated need to transport authorized passengers.  (T-1). 5.3.2.2.  The  conveyance  used  must  be  no  larger  than  the  most  economical  available  to accommodate “duty” passengers.  (T-1). 5.3.2.3.  Surveys will be conducted in conjunction with the semiannual services analysis, to ensure that the conditions for approval remain valid.  (T-0). 5.3.3.  Space-available  transportation  on  existing,  scheduled  shuttle  buses  may  be  provided to:  Military  personnel,  DoD  civilian  employees,  Reserve  and  National  Guard  members, Dependents of active duty personnel, retirees, base visitors and in overseas areas, volunteers of Type 2 - Affiliated Private Organization, as identified in DoDI 1000.15,  Procedures and Support for Non-Federal Entities Authorized to Operate on DOD Installations. 5.3.4.  Shuttle  bus  service  may  be  provided  with  DoD-owned  or  contract  equipment.  Expenses for the operation of such services will be paid from appropriated funds.  (T-0). 5.3.5.  Shuttle bus service in support of TDY personnel and transient aircrews: 5.3.5.1.  Establish  special  shuttle  bus  services  at  installations  to  accommodate  large numbers  of  TDY  personnel  and  transient  aircrews  when  the  service  would  be  the  most cost effective and efficient support. 5.3.5.2.  Authorized stops will include on- or off-base lodging, duty locations, and NAF facilities only.  (T-0).  Establishing shuttle stops for off-base entertainment is prohibited. 5.3.6.  The authority to approve shuttle bus service rests with the servicing LRS commander.  Note:    Installation  commander  concurrence  is  also  required  to  establish  shuttle  bus  service for enlisted personnel traveling between dormitories. 5.3.7.  Under appropriate authority, IAW federal law and DoD policy, transportation support is  authorized  for  certain  non-federal  entities.    Refer  to  DoDM  4500.36  and  DoDI  1000.15.  This does not include UDI support. 5.3.8.  Establishment  of  shuttle  bus  routes  and  schedules  require  careful  planning.    The number  of  personnel  using  this  service,  work  schedules,  traffic  studies  and  potential  for saving energy and reducing air pollution will be considered.  (T-1).  The bus used must be no larger  than  the  most  economical  available  to  accommodate  duty  passengers.    (T-0).    Bus service  routes  will  not  include  housing,  recreational,  or  shopping  areas  unless  such  areas cannot be reasonably avoided in serving the authorized locations.  (T-1). 5.3.9.  Approved  schedules  will  be  reviewed  during  the  semiannual  services  analysis  to determine  if  conditions  continue  to  warrant  their  operation  or  if  adjustments  to  routes  or schedule should be made.  (T-0). AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 43 5.4.  Group Transportation Services:  Group transportation service will normally be limited to those  situations  where  there  is  a  need  to  provide  DTD  transportation  to  personnel  for  different destinations than government installations and sub-installations.  (T-0). 5.4.1.  These  situations  must  be  considered  essential  for  the  effective  conduct  of  the  Air Force mission.  (T-0).  For example, an installation that is located so far from the source of manpower  that  government  assistance  is  necessary  to  make  sure  personnel  have  adequate transportation.    Another  example  is  a  situation  where  an  overseas  area  does  not  have adequate  public  or  private  transportation,  or  where  local  political  situations,  security, personal safety, or geographic locations of duty stations make this transportation essential to conduct Air Force business. 5.4.2.  This  is  a reasonable fare-charging service that  requires a vehicle with  a minimum  of 12-passenger seats to transport military and civilian employees. 5.4.3.  To establish Group Transportation Service, submit requests to AFIMSC/CC, ANG/CC or AFRC/CC for approval.  Requests must include the following information:  (T-0). 5.4.3.1.  The name, mission, and location of the activity. 5.4.3.2.  The current military and civilian strength and any authorized changes that might affect transportation requirements to include a breakdown of shifts if necessary. 5.4.3.3.  A description of existing transportation available including the use of POVs, car pools, and group riding arrangements. 5.4.3.4.  Points/  locations  where  the  service  is  required  and  the  distance  between  the installation and each point. 5.4.3.5.  The number of people requiring recurring transportation between the installation and  each  point.    Estimates  based  on  customer  surveys  are  acceptable  for  establishing  a new service. 5.4.3.6.  A statement describing efforts to make existing transportation (public or private) adequate and efforts taken to induce private operators to provide the required service. 5.4.3.7.  The type of service proposed and pertinent information about arrangements such as  rentals,  charters,  rates,  routes,  and  schedules.    Include  the  type,  source,  number,  and seating capacity of the equipment to be used.  Enclose a fare quote and a map of the area.  If  GMVs  will  be  used,  the  request  must  indicate  that  local  commercial  carriers  do  not have a desire nor the capacity to provide the service.  (T-0). 5.4.3.8.  A  statement  as  to  the  estimated  cost  and  availability  of  appropriated  funds  to operate the service. 5.4.3.9.  The proposed start date. 5.4.4.  Approval authorities and commanders who operate and administer group bus service will, before and while implementing such service determine that:  (T-0). 5.4.4.1.  Other methods are not adequate and cannot be made adequate. 5.4.4.2.  Contact  with  private  sources  to  provide  the  necessary  transportation  has  been unsuccessful. 44 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 5.4.4.3.  The service furnished will make the most efficient use of resources.  (T-0). 5.4.5.  Group  Transportation  Service  will  be  reviewed  during  the  semiannual  services analysis  to  ensure  the  support  is  appropriate  and  that  the  most  efficient  form  of  service  is provided.  (T-0). 5.4.6.  AFIMSC,  NGB  or  AFRC  reviews  operational  data  annually  to  ensure  continued service  is  justified.    (T-1).    Provide  a  certification  of  review  completion,  the  results  of  the review, and a current list of locations to HQ USAF/A4LR by 1 November each year (RCA: HAF-A4L  (A)  8103,  Annual  Group  Transportation  Review  Certificate).    This  report  is designated  emergency  status  code  D.    Immediately  discontinue  reporting  data  requirements during emergency conditions.  The use of GMV buses (owned, contractor-owned, leased or chartered  to  private  or  public  carriers)  is  authorized  under  terms  approved  by  HQ USAF/A4L.  (T-1). 5.5.  Mass  Transit  Service:  Mass transit service is designed to fulfill requirements beyond the scope of shuttle bus service.  Mass transit service may be used to provide other “non-duty” types of transportation within a military installation or between sub-installations on a fare basis. 5.5.1.  The authority to  approve mass transit service or to  waive the fare rests with  the first commanding Air Force flag officer in the chain of command or the civilian equivalent. 5.5.2.  The  Secretary  of  Defense  has  authorized  the  commanding  general  or  flag  officer  to establish fare-free bus service if the specific, objective criteria identified below are met: 5.5.2.1.  There  is  no  regularly  scheduled  mass  transportation  that  runs  twice  a  day,  five times  a  week  between  sending  or  receiving  installations  that  picks  up  and  drops  off passengers within 1/2 mile of the installation. 5.5.2.2.  There  is  no  regularly  scheduled  mass  transportation  that  runs  twice  a  day,  five times a week between sending or receiving installations that provides a pickup from the sending installation by 0800. 5.5.2.3.  There  is  no  regularly  scheduled  mass  transportation  that  runs  twice  a  day,  five times a week between sending or receiving installations that provides last departure from the receiving location by 1900. 5.5.2.4.  There  is  no  regularly  scheduled  mass  transportation  that  runs  twice  a  day,  five times  a  week  between  sending  or  receiving  installations  that  is  licensed  and  operates IAW reasonable maintenance and safety standards. 5.5.2.5.  Other  mass  transportation  providers  are  unable  or  have  declined  to  provide adequate  transportation  facilities  or  services  after  a  reasonable  effort  has  been  made  to induce them to do so. 5.5.2.6.  The service saves unproductive person-hours. 5.5.2.7.  The service enhances the rider’s quality of life. 5.5.2.8.  The NTVs used will hold 12 or more riders, including the driver, and operate at 50  percent  of  capacity  on  a  monthly  basis.    (T-0).    For  example,  service  schedule  for three times a week using a 16-passenger bus would require a minimum monthly ridership of 96.  (i.e., 8 passengers X 3 days per week X 4 weeks per month) passengers to justify use.) AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 45 5.5.2.9.  The receiving installation is more than 1 mile from the sending installation. 5.5.2.10.  The service to  be furnished will pick up and drop off at centralized collection points  and  otherwise  make  proper  use  of  transportation  facilities  to  supply  the  most efficient transportation to eligible passengers.  (T-0). 5.5.2.11.  The  fare  charged  by  other  mass  transportation  providers  exceed  $1.00  per passenger per round trip. 5.5.2.12.  The  sending  location  does  not  have  adequate  medical,  dental,  commissary,  or Base Exchange facilities; the rider’s place of work is located on the receiving installation; or the use of privately owned NTVs is restricted in the area served. 5.5.3.  Mass  transit service provided under this authority  will be for the primary purpose of providing access to life-support facilities for Service members and their dependents.  (T-0). 5.5.4.  Unless  waived,  a  reasonable  fare  will  be  charged  for  mass  transportation  provided under this authority.  (T-0). 5.5.4.1.  For OCONUS locations, a reasonable fare will be charged that is not more than would be charged if such service were available  through local commercial or municipal transportation services.  (T-0). 5.5.4.2.  This fare will be a pro-rata share of all costs of providing the mass transportation service, including capital investment, salaries, operations and maintenance.  (T-1). 5.5.4.3.  If  the  GMV  is  used  for  operational  missions  and  mass  transportation,  only  the cost directly related to mass transportation must be recovered.  (T-0).  Since these GMVs are  acquired  in  direct  support  of  the  DoD’s  mission,  acquisition  costs  will  not  be recovered through the fare system.  (T-0). 5.5.5.  Criteria for fare-charged and fare-free mass transit service must be met, documented, and  retained  on  file  with  the  approving  authority  IAW  the  National  Archives  and  Records Administration approved records retention schedule.  (T-0). 5.5.5.1.  Description of the mass transit services. 5.5.5.2.  Synopsis of schedules and routes of the mass transit services. 5.5.5.3.  Factual synopsis to support each of the objective criteria. 5.5.5.4.  Local  commander’s  evaluation  or  statement  that  mass  transit  services  meet  the identified criteria and is still required. 5.5.6.  There will be no additional funds to defray cost of this service.  (T-0). 5.5.7.  Service  will  be  reviewed  during  the  semiannual  services  analysis  to  ensure  the schedule is adequate and that the most efficient form of service is provided.  (T-0). 5.5.8.  Only the SecAF may provide an exception to mass transit service criteria. 5.6.  Emergency  Bus  Service:  Emergency  bus  service  between  residence  and  place  of employment  may  be  provided  for  military  personnel  and  civilian  employees  during  public transportation  strikes  and  transportation  outages.    Service  is  limited  only  to  those  Air  Force employees who are actively engaged in projects, or in the support of projects, the delay of which 46 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 would adversely affect national defense.  Routine work, such as construction, repair, or overhaul of aircraft, ships or materiel peculiar to the Military does not qualify under this policy. 5.6.1.  A  fare  that  recovers  the  operational  costs  will  be  charged  for  such  service  and accounted for.  (T-0). 5.6.2.  The authority to approve emergency bus service rests with the first commanding Air Force flag officer in the chain of command or the civilian equivalent. 5.6.3.  Records will be kept IAW with DODM 4500.36.  (T-0). 5.7.  Military Community Activities:  Bus transportation in support of DoD-authorized Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) programs, community activity programs, family service center programs,  or  private  organizations  may  be  provided  when  such  transportation  can  be  made available  without  detriment  to  the  DoD  mission.    This  service  is  limited  to  full  support  of Category  A  MWR  activities,  substantial  support  of  Category  B  MWR  activities,  and  some limited support of Category C MWR activities.  The categories of MWR activities and funding support authorized are contained in AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) and Non-appropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIS). 5.7.1.  All  requests  for  support  must  be  coordinated  through  the  LRS  commander  and  FSS commander.    (T-1).    The  installation  commander  is  the  approval  authority.    Assets  may  be used in support of military community activities only after mission requirements have been met. 5.7.2.  Category  C  activities  at  approved  remote  and  isolated  locations  are  generally authorized Category B level APF support, based on availability of resources at each location.  AFI  65-106  identifies  approved  remote  and/or  isolated  locations  for  NAF/MWR  support reasons. 5.7.3.  Services  cannot  be  provided  for  domicile-to-duty  transport.    The  following  are examples  of  general  mass  transportation  services  routinely  provided  when  requirements  of paragraph 5.7.1. have been met and service can be made available without detriment to the mission: 5.7.3.1.  Non-reimbursable. 5.7.3.1.1.  Command  or  base  varsity  teams  on  official  government  travel  orders composed of personnel who officially represent the Air Force in scheduled events. 5.7.3.1.2.  Military personnel and/or dependent spectators to attend Air Force Band or Tops-in-Blue concerts or events, on- or off-base in the local area. 5.7.3.1.3.  Entertainers,  guests  and  their  supplies  and  equipment  essential  to  morale and  welfare  programs.    Note:    Use  of  utility  type  vehicles  for  cargo  movements  is authorized. 5.7.3.1.4.  Civilian  groups  transported  to/on  military  installations  in  the  interest  of community  relations  when  officially  invited  by  the  installation  commander  or  other competent  authority  and  deemed  non-reimbursable  IAW  AFI  35-105,  Community Relations. 5.7.3.1.5.  Base-sponsored tours and trips when operated on a nonprofit basis.  Assets may be used only after mission requirements have been met. AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 47 5.7.3.1.6.  Scouting programs, e.g., Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America operating at U.S. military installations located overseas. 5.7.3.1.7.  Support  of  chaplain’s  programs  such  as:    religious  education,  picnics, special  groups,  social  activities,  renewal  activities,  chapel  youth  trips,  or  summer camps. 5.7.3.1.8.  Support  may  be  provided  for  events  of  installation-wide  or  community-wide interest as part of the military community relations program when approved by the installation commander.  The use of DoD resources or personnel for community relations  activities  will  not  interfere  with  accomplishment  of  operational  missions.  (T-0). 5.7.3.2.  Reimbursable. 5.7.3.2.1.  Transportation  may  be  provided  to  MWR/NAF  category  C  revenue-generating organizations (refer to  AFI 65-106).   Such service shall be accomplished on a reimbursable basis.  (T-0).  A fare is charged for all operations and maintenance costs (formula in Table 5.1 will be used to determine reimbursement).  (T-0).  Do not use vehicle acquisition costs when determining the fare. 5.7.3.2.2.  Limit GMV bus support to on-installation wing events only (see Chapter 3 for examples of unauthorized events). 5.7.3.2.3.  Specific  guidance  for  supporting  Private  Organizations  can  be  found  in AFI  34-223,  Private  Organizations  (PO)  Program.    Private  organizations  generally do not get either NAF or APF support. 5.8.  Fares  and  Proceeds:  Accounting  and  Finance  (ACF)  and  LRS  will  determine  how  to account for and deposit fares and proceeds.  (T-0).  As a general rule, return proceeds to the LRS Operations & Maintenance (O&M) accounts for unfunded support.  Deposit proceeds in the U.S. Treasury  as  miscellaneous  receipts  according  to  Air  Force  financial  guidance.    Recover  only costs  directly  related  to  category  of  transportation  provided  if  the  GMV  supports  both operational  (mission)  and  group/mass  transportation  using  Table  5.1  below.    In  overseas  areas only, the fare may not exceed the fare charged by commercial municipal transportation (if such transportation  were  available).    In  isolated  areas  the  fare  charged  will  not  exceed  $1.00  per passenger, per round trip.  (T-1).         48 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 Table 5.1.  Computing Reimbursement and Bus Fares: Step 1 (To Determine Operations Cost) (Example cost only) a.  Determine vehicle operator cost using the average hourly pay for the operator’s rank. (see Military Personnel Composite Standard Pay and Reimbursement Rate, Tab K: http://comptroller.defense.gov/)  Obtain  most current  rate  from  local  accounting  &  finance  office.    Example cost:  An E-4 hourly rate is $36.62. b.   Determine  the  number  of  hours  necessary  to  complete  the  transportation request.  Example: 8 hours c.  Multiply steps a and b d.  Determine total miles required to support request e.  Determine the vehicle cost by obtaining the annual fleet average direct cost per  mile  for  a  particular  vehicle  type  from  OLVIMS  data. Example:  28- passenger bus (B121) with an average cost per mile of 47 cents.  See Note 2 f.  Multiply steps d and e Notes: 1.  An operator cost is not charged if an off-duty volunteer drives the vehicle. 2.  Obtain vehicle O&M cost per mile through Vehicle Management using LIMS-EV, VV, or lease vehicle costs or cost per mile from leasing agency, i.e., GSA or commercial. 3.  If total costs are all that is required, steps 2 and 3 are not needed. Step 2 (To Determine Fare Cost) a.  Determine number of passenger seats requested.  Do not count the operator or driver seat.  Example:  a 28-passenger bus is requested. b.  Add steps 1c with 1f and divide by 2a ($284.96 + 117.50 div. by 28) Note:   Fare cost will include all mileage driven to support the request in the computation. (T-0).  For example, if the vehicle travels 10 miles to pick up the first passenger, include that mileage in the computation. Step 3 (To Determine Mass-Transit Fare Cost) a.  Use the average number of passengers transported per day to determine the fare per person.  Re-compute fees semiannually in conjunction with Semiannual Vehicle Operations Services Analyses. b.  Add steps 1c with 1f and divide by 3a ($284.96 + 117.50 div. by 300)  $36.62 8 (hours) $284.96 250 (miles) .47 $117.50   28 $14.37   300 $1.34 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 49 Chapter 6 TRANSPORTATION OF DEPENDENT SCHOOL CHILDREN Section 6A—General and Administrative Procedures for Transporting Dependent School Children in the United States 6.1.  Transporting Dependent School Children in the United States:  These policies apply to all  DoD  dependent  students  who  attend  schools  in  the  50  States,  the  District  of  Columbia,  the Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico,  the  Commonwealth  of  Northern  Marianas  Islands,  Guam  and Midway Island.  It also applies to DoD dependents and other children eligible to attend schools operated by the DoD Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS). 6.1.1.  Authorities:  There are two distinct authorities for providing this transportation: 6.1.1.1.  10  U.S.C.  §  2164  provides  authority  and  eligibility  criteria  to  extend  federal assistance to eligible local education agencies (LEAs) providing educational services for children  residing  on  federal  property,  including  DoD  installations.    In  consideration  for federal assistance to  LEA providing education for children residing on federal property, the  agencies  that  provide  transportation  to  school  children  in  their  districts  provide transportation  to  children  residing  on  Air  Force  installations  located  within  their  school districts.    If  transportation  is  provided  for  local  students  but  not  Air  Force  dependent students,  the  Air  Force  may  provide  transportation  to  those  students.    The  cost  of providing this transportation may be sought from the local education agency pursuant to Department of Education procedures. 6.1.1.2.  10  U.S.C.  §  2639,  Transportation  to  and  from  School  for  Certain  Minor Dependents,  authorizes  each  military  department to  provide  funds  specifically appropriated  for  the  transportation  of  military  dependents  between  their  school  and  the military installation when schools are not accessible by regular means of transportation.  Provide  support  when  an  appropriate  official  of  the  local  education  agency  advises  the school  district  they  will  not  provide  school  transportation.    (T-0).    Once  these requirements  are  met,  the  installation  commander  forwards  a  letter  to  the  LRS commander indicating that transporting school children is authorized.  (T-0).  Provide the most  economical,  efficient  service  using  GMVs  (owned,  leased,  or  contracted  service).  Revalidate the commander’s letter annually through the local school district.  (T-0). 6.1.2.  Transportation may be provided to: 6.1.2.1.  Local  public  schools  when  the  school  is  not  accessible  or  serviced  by  local school bus transportation. 6.1.2.2.  Nearby  public  schools,  other  than  the  local  public  schools,  when  either  the nearby schools are not accessible or when the SecAF determines that local public schools where  children  would  normally  attend  are  unable  to  adequately  provide  for  their education  and  that  attendance  at  other  public  schools  (to  include  public  schools  for  the handicapped)  in  a  nearby  school  district  can  be  arranged  and  that  the  transportation cannot be provided as described above. 50 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 6.1.3.  Each child may make one trip to and one trip from school per day. 6.1.4.  The dominant user coordinates transportation arrangements to minimize transportation resources involving more than one DoD installation. 6.1.5.  The  walking  distance  between  residence  and  school  or  between  residence  and designated bus stop is established for dependent children by the local public school authority. 6.1.6.  To  make  connections  with  a  regular  means  of  transportation,  children  may  use available,  regularly  scheduled  DoD  transportation  within  and  between  installations  when they  travel  to  and  from  school.    Similarly,  provide  special  transportation  within  the installation if this will serve to make schools accessible by a regular means of transportation.  (T-0). 6.1.7.  Develop  written  agreements  that  specify  the  services  and  support  provided  (include reimbursement procedures) to local education agencies when it is necessary for the Air Force to  provide  transportation  for  dependents  to  public  schools  or  to  schools  operated  on  DoD installations. 6.1.8.  Credit  reimbursement  costs  to  applicable  appropriations.    Reimbursement  costs consist of all costs of operations, maintenance, depreciation of equipment, and compensation costs  of  the  drivers  directly  engaged  in  providing  the  service.    DoD  7000.14-R  (Volume 11A), governs reimbursement. 6.1.9.  Transportation  may  be  provided  to  private  or  parochial  schools  within  a  reasonable distance when: 6.1.9.1.  The  private  school  is  not  accessible  by  a  regular  means  of  transportation  and private school transportation (either with or without cost to the member) is not available and  the  parent  of  a  child  submits  a  written  request  for  transportation  to  the  head  of  the installation (do not approve requests to avoid transportation costs to the member). 6.1.10.  The  installation  commander  or  designee  may  approve  transportation  support  when one of the following conditions exists: 6.1.10.1.  The public schools  available in  the locality  are inadequate  for the educational welfare of the children concerned.  An adequate  education is  considered  one that meets the State certification and regional accreditation requirements. 6.1.10.2.  The  vehicle  used  for  transporting  dependent  children  to  public  schools  has extra  space  and  can  transport  the  child  attending  private  or  parochial  schools  without materially deviating from the established route. 6.1.10.3.  The  DoD  installation  is  so  remotely  located  that  the  private  school  is  not accessible by regular means of transportation. 6.1.10.4.  Upon  validation  of  student  transportation  requirements  by  the  installation commander: 6.1.10.4.1.  Military in-house transportation resources must be used to the maximum extent possible.  (T-0).  Use vehicles for other official transportation needs when not transporting students. AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 51 6.1.10.4.2.  If funds are available, installation commanders may authorize commercial transportation  when  in-house  transportation  resources  are  not  available.    Each commercial  contract  must  contain  an  agreement  by  the  contractor  to  furnish  the service  without  discrimination  on  the  grounds  of  race,  creed,  color,  sex,  or  national origin.    (T-0).    The  AFIMSC,  NGB  or  AFRC  must  approve  all  requests  and subsequent changes.  (T-1). 6.1.10.4.3.  Normally,  military  transportation  using  part-time  drivers  is  used  except when it is more economical to use commercial contract transportation services, based on  comparative  cost  analysis  of  in-house  versus  commercial  contract  school  bus service. 6.1.10.4.4.  Exceptions to General Policy:  The installation or community commander may make exceptions to the school routes when the existing route is through areas of heavy  traffic,  blighted  urban  or  residential  districts,  or  potentially  dangerous construction,  industrial  areas,  or  during  severe  weather  conditions.    All  other exceptions require SecAF approval.  The installation commander must send requests, with justification, through the AFIMSC, NGB, or AFRC to HQ USAF/A4L.  (T-1). Section 6B—General and Administrative Procedures for Transporting Dependent School Children in Overseas Areas 6.2.  Transporting  Dependent  School  Children  in  Overseas  Areas:  These  policies  apply  to all students attending DoD-operated or non-DoD schools located outside the United States.  (T-0). 6.2.1.  Authority:  The Secretary of Defense may establish and operate a program to provide a free public education, through secondary schools, for dependents in overseas areas per Title 20  U.  S.  C.  §  921,  Defense  Dependents  Education  System.    This  authorization  includes  the provision of any necessary incidental services. 6.2.2.  Commuting  Area:    The  Department  of  Defense  Education  Activity  (DoDEA)  Area Transportation Management Office establishes a commuting area to determine eligibility for transportation  at  each  Department  of  Defense  Dependent  Schools  (DoDDS)  school.    This area is based on availability of adequate housing within the proximity of the school, DoDEA commuting  distance  policy,  and  available  resources.    Elapsed  travel  time  from  the  farthest point  within  the  commuting  area  should  not  exceed  1-hour  unless  waived  by  the  DoDEA.  The  commuting  area  does  not  have  to  be  equidistant  in  all  directions  from  the  school,  nor must  it  be  as  far  as  1-hour  commuting  time  if  sufficient  and  adequate  housing  is  available within  a  closer  distance.    If  a  locality  otherwise  within  the  commuting  area  has  difficult  or unsafe access (e.g., during the winter), it should be excluded from the commuting area. 6.2.2.1.  The  installation  or  community  commander  will  give  the  commuting  area widespread  publicity  during  incoming  personnel  processing,  Housing  Referral  Officer visits,  sponsor  programs,  etc.,  so  every  sponsor  is  well  informed  before  looking  for family housing.  (T-0). 6.2.2.2.  The  installation  or  community  commander  will  ensure  that  all  incoming sponsors certify in writing that they are aware of the commuting area and understand that, if  they  choose  to  live  in  housing  outside  the  commuting  area,  they  are  responsible  for 52 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 transportation  of  dependent  students  between  their  home  and  the  school  or  an  existing stop within the commuting area.  (T-0). 6.2.3.  Walking Area:  The DoDEA Area Transportation Management Office also establishes a walking area for each school.  Normally, walking distance to a school  or bus stop should not exceed 1 mile for students in kindergarten to grade 6 and 1.5 miles for students in grades 7-12.  Walking areas are expanded and contracted to conform to the natural boundaries such as  a  housing  area,  neighborhood,  etc.    Do  not  provide  transportation  to  students  within  the walking  area  except  for  students  with  disabilities  when  required  by  their  Individual Education Plan (IEP). 6.2.4.  Authorized  Transportation:    In  many  areas,  the  DoDEA  Area  Transportation Management Office manages school bus service.  The following policies apply where the Air Force provides school bus services. 6.2.4.1.  DoD-Operated Schools: 6.2.4.1.1.  Provide  one  round-trip  between  family  residential  areas  and  DoDDS schools  for  dependent  students  who  reside  outside  the  walking  area  and  within  the commuting area (or who are transported at  the sponsor’s expense to  an existing bus stop within the commuting area) of a DoDDS school.  Do not provide a second round trip to/from home for lunch.  Establish centrally located school bus stops in the area of  student  residences  and/or  alternate  care  providers,  such  as  a  Child  Development Center  within  the  commuting  area.    Provide  curb-to-curb  service  only  for  students with disabilities when required by their IEP. 6.2.4.1.2.  Provide  commuting  transportation  to  non-federally  connected  space-available  students  on  existing  routes  only  if  space  is  available  on  the  route(s)  to  be used.  Do not provide commuter passes or bus tickets instead of transportation in kind to non-federally connected students. 6.2.4.1.3.  Provide  transportation  to  students  participating  in  school-sponsored educational  activities  such  as  field  trips  if  vehicles  and  operators  are  available  and support will not conflict with mission support requirements.  (T-0). 6.2.4.1.4.  When approved by the LRS commanders, transportation may be provided for  students  participating  in  voluntary  after-school  activities  (e.g.,  sports  programs) from the school to a limited number of central locations, such as major housing areas and public transportation terminals, as approved by school officials and subject to the availability of funds, vehicles, and drivers. 6.2.4.1.4.1.  Transport  of  DoDDS  sports  teams  and  groups  to  airports  and  train stations  for  overnight/multiple  day trips  will  fall  under  DoD  Terminal Transportation rules identified in DoDM 4500.36.  (T-0). 6.2.4.2.  Non-DoD Schools: 6.2.4.2.1.  Students  who  attend  a  non-DoD  school  at  DoD  expense  and  who  reside beyond the walking distance of the non-DoD school shall use transportation provided or arranged by the non-DoD school  when included as part of the tuition fee.   (T-0).  When non-DoD schools do not provide transportation, or when the cost of providing AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 53 transportation  is  charged  separately,  the  installation  commander,  the  Director, DoDEA, or Designees will determine the proper transportation.  (T-0). 6.2.4.2.2.  Transportation may be provided to dependent students of DoD military or civilian personnel who attend non-DoD schools in overseas areas at no expense to the U.S. Government only when such attendance has been approved by the DoDDS Area director or designee. 6.2.4.3.  Transportation for students with disabilities:  Place special emphasis on meeting the  transportation  needs  of  students  with  disabilities.    The  installation  must  provide equitable  transportation  to  these  students.   The  Chief,  DoDEA  Area Transportation  Management  Office,  after  consultation  with  the  base  LRS  commander, will  determine  the  most  cost  effective  method  of  transporting  students  with  disabilities (e.g.,  conventional  GMVs,  modification  of  existing  government  vehicles,  lease,  or contract support).  (T-0).   (T-0). 6.2.4.3.1.  Provide commuting transportation to special education students who reside within  walking  distance  of  the  school  or  bus  stop  or  at  any  distance  within  the commuting area, when the nature of their handicap so dictates, as documented in the IEP. 6.2.4.3.2.  Provide  special  transportation  services  prescribed  by  the  Case  Study Committee (CSC) of the receiving school.  Examples of special services include, but are  not  limited  to,  curb-to-curb  service,  a  special  bus  stop  within  an  IEP-specified distance of the student’s residence, use of special harness or child seat, transportation of a seeing eye or hearing dog, or a one-on-one safety attendant for medically fragile or physically aggressive children. 6.2.4.3.3.  Ensure  that  all  vehicles  transporting  special  education  students  are equipped with a seat belt for each passenger. 6.2.4.3.4.  Provide a safety attendant who is trained to assist students with disabilities for all vehicles transporting more than two special education students or transporting any  student  requiring  a  special  four  point  harness.    Ensure  that  vehicles  used  to transport students who normally use wheelchairs are equipped with a lifting device or ramp which can be secured to the vehicle and are equipped with approved wheelchair restraining  devices.    Note:    Before  providing  transportation  to  special  education students for whom a safety attendant is required, the VOCC NCOIC and the vehicle operator  must  ensure  trained  personnel  are  available  to  accompany  those  students during travel.  (T-0). 6.2.5.  Transportation Resources:  Students shall be transported at the lowest practical cost to the U.S. Government.  (T-0). 6.2.5.1.  Periodic  Review:    The  DoDEA  Area  Transportation  Management  Office  will analyze  transportation  services  a  minimum  of  every  6  months,  in  coordination  with  the base  LRS  commander.    (T-1).    Analysis  will  include  a  thorough  review  of  student demand, school bus routes, and schedules, and will consider the following factors:  (T-0). 6.2.5.1.1.  Staggering school operating hours to permit buses to operate multiple trips per day. 54 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 6.2.5.1.2.  Altering  school  organization  plans  and  establishing  flexible  school boundaries to maximize transportation resources. 6.2.5.1.3.  Consolidating  school  closures  for  administrative  activities  (meetings, training, conferences, etc.) to avoid half-day sessions and scheduling these activities to coincide with host nations’ holidays whenever possible. 6.2.5.1.4.  Developing routes and schedules to optimize the use of buses and seating capacity and to reduce total mileage and driving time.  Use the projected number of space-required students as the basis for routes.  Do not use larger capacity vehicles to accommodate space-available students or other ineligible passengers. 6.2.5.1.5.  Seating  students  in  kindergarten  through  grade  5  to  ride  three  to  a  bench seat,  except  for  front  seats  or  seats  designated  for  non-use  due  to  safety  reasons provided the buses bench seat is a minimum of 39 inches wide. 6.2.5.1.6.  Using part time employees for in-house operations whenever possible. 6.2.5.1.7.  Requiring  students  in  grades  7-12  to  use  regular  public  or  DoD transportation  (e.g.,  base  shuttle  buses)  where  available,  feasible,  and  cost-efficient.  DoDDS  would  reimburse  for  this  service  if  student  use  resulted  in  direct  costs increase to the military. The safety and security of students must be also considered when using alternative transportation.  (T-0). 6.2.5.2.  Economic  Cost  Analysis:    Determine  the  most  economical  means  of  providing school  bus  services  through  in-depth  comparative  analysis  of  in-house  to  contract operations.    Analysis  must  consider  the  overall  cost  to  the  Government  of  providing school bus transportation with DoD vehicles.  (T-0).  Use commercial contract vendors to provide  transportation  support  to  DoDDS  schools  when  it  is  determined  to  be  more economical.  Otherwise, use military transportation, with part-time drivers when possible.  Integrate  school  busing  with  other  installation  mass  transportation  functions  whenever reasonable to do so.  Include equipment acquisition costs as a factor in the cost analysis.  However,  DoDDS  shall  not  be  required  to  reimburse  the  Air  Force  for  government-owned  equipment,  acquisition  costs,  or  amortization  of  these  equipment  costs,  or  for lease,  rental  or  other  equipment  usage  costs  when  the  underlying  cost  analysis  has indicated that the leased equipment is less costly than the government-owned equipment.  (T-0).  Conduct an economic cost analysis IAW DoDI 7041.3, under any of the following circumstances: 6.2.5.2.1.  When arranging for initial transportation services to a new school or before changing from existing military transportation to contract transportation. 6.2.5.2.2.  When the number of contractors is insufficient to ensure competitive bids for transportation services to schools currently serviced by contract transportation. 6.2.5.2.3.  When  requested  by  the  Chief,  DoDEA  Area  Transportation  Management Office. 6.2.5.3.  Proposed  Changes  to  Services:    DoDDS  area  director,  or  designee,  will coordinate  with  the  installation  and/or  community  commanders  on  any  significant proposed  change  to  school  bus  services.    (T-0).    The  concurrence  of  the  DoDDS  area director, or designee, shall be obtained before implementing any such change.  (T-0).  All AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 55 documentation  associated  with  the  provision  of  school  bus  services,  e.g.,  cost  studies, solicitation packages and amendments thereto, shall be provided to DoDDS upon request.  (T-0). 6.2.6.  Bus Safety and Security: 6.2.6.1.  Student Conduct:  The DoDEA has developed standards of behavior for students riding school  buses  and  guidelines  for disciplinary  actions when students  misbehave on buses. 6.2.6.1.1.  Installation  commanders  must  ensure  that  students  and  their  parents, guardians, and sponsors know what  the standards of student behavior aboard school buses  are  before  the  school  year  begins.    (T-0).    School  bus  riding  is  a  privilege, which may be withdrawn if a student misbehaves or is  deemed a safety  concern  for the driver or other passengers. 6.2.6.1.2.  At  bases  where installation  commander  has  retained  primary responsibility  for  school  buses  passenger  management,  the  commander  will  apply guidelines established by DoDEA to ensure consequences of misconduct are applied equitably throughout overseas areas.  (T-0). the 6.2.6.2.  Safety Reviews:  Installation commanders must conduct periodic safety reviews a minimum of every 6 months of school buses and loading and unloading areas.  (T-0).  Ensure  that  any  contracts  for  school  bus  services  contain  a  provision  permitting  similar safety reviews of contractor vehicles and services. 6.2.6.3.  School  Bus  Monitors:    Do  not  hire,  or  contract  for,  school  bus  monitors  to maintain  order  on  the  bus  except  where  required  by  host  nation  statute.    However, communities may provide school bus monitors on a volunteer basis. 6.2.6.4.  Safety  Attendants:    The  DoDDS  area  director  may  authorize  school  bus  safety attendants  for  vehicles  transporting  special  education  students  or  vehicles  transporting only  DoDEA  preschool,  Sure-Start  and  kindergarten  students.    If  funds  allow,  safety attendant authorization may be extended through grade 2 student transportation.  Duties of  a  safety  attendant  are  to  ensure  that  children  enter  and  exit  the  school  buses  safely and/or to assist students with disabilities.  Normally, only one adult other than the driver shall be assigned to a vehicle.  (T-0).  Where drivers speak English, safety attendants are authorized only when required for special education buses. 6.2.6.5.  Security  Personnel:    When  the  installation  commander  deems  that  local conditions  jeopardize  the  security  of  school  bus  services,  the  commander  may  place appropriately trained security personnel aboard those buses.  Security personnel will not concern themselves with passenger conduct.   (T-0).  DoDDS funds will not be used for this purpose.  (T-0). 6.2.6.6.  Contingency  Plans:    Installation  commanders  shall  work  with  appropriate DoDDS officials to develop and publish contingency plans for transporting students.  (T-0).    Ensure  that  overall  base  contingency  plans  for  natural  disaster,  bomb  threat,  etc. include DoDDS schools and student transportation. 6.2.7.  Exceptions for Commuting Area or Walking Distance:  The DoDEA area director may grant  exceptions  to  the  commuting  area  or  walking  distance  criteria  after  considering 56 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 circumstances  and  alternatives.    Requests  for  exceptions  are  initiated  by  the  installation  or community  commander,  and  endorsed  by  the  local  concerned  principal.    At  a  minimum, waiver requests will address:  (T-0). 6.2.7.1.  Name of the school. 6.2.7.2.  Reason for the waiver request:  When safety considerations are a factor, include a statement of verification from the base safety officer.  The base safety officer reviews and certifies these conditions annually. 6.2.7.3.  Statement  of  alternatives  that  may  eliminate  or  alter  the  conditions  requiring  a waiver, i.e., construction of sidewalks or pedestrian overpass, installation of traffic lights or use of the crossing guards. 6.2.7.4.  The number of students involved. 6.2.7.5.  Impact if the waiver is not approved. 6.2.7.6.  Budgetary impact if the waiver is granted. 6.2.7.7.  Comments and recommendations from endorsing officials. AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 57 Chapter 7 ELEMENT MANPOWER MANAGEMENT Section 7A—General Information and Administration 7.1.  Overview:  Manpower and its effective use is  an inherent  responsibility of the DSC.  The use  of  accurate  manpower/workload  data  collection  procedures  and  personnel  productivity analysis is vital to the effective utilization of personnel and maximizing the level of service to the customer.    See  AFMS  42A1  Vehicle  Operations  Function,  for  primary  workload  factors associated with Vehicle Operations manpower. 7.2.  Workload  Data  Collection  and  Productivity:  The accuracy of workload data entered in the  OLVIMS  Dispatch  Module  is  critical  to  assessing  productivity,  substantiating  existing manpower  variances,  and  building  historical  data  to  support  potential  manpower  variances.    A minimum  of  12  months  historical  workload  data  will  be  maintained  on  file.    (T-1).    At  a minimum, collect and review the following data monthly for 12-month retention: 7.2.1.  Manpower Report (automated). 7.2.1.1.  Summary of work by module category codes; i.e., number of requests supported and total in-service time in man-hours. 7.2.1.2.  Summary of work for approved driving related variances i.e., number of requests supported and total  in-service time in  man-hours.   Include purpose, submission  for new variances, data required, etc. 7.2.1.3.  All  requests  not  supported  for  reasons  of  NMA  or  NVA  categories.    Note:  Requests  not  supported  due  to  NMA/NVA  must  be  documented  within  the  OLVIMS Dispatch Module.  (T-1). 7.2.2.  Current Unit Manpower Document:  The Unit Manpower Document (UMD) displays the number and type of manpower requirements for your unit by grade, AFSC, etc. 7.2.2.1.  UMDs  contain  authorization  (funded),  peacetime  (required),  authorized (unfunded),  CMEs  (Contract  Manpower  Equivalents)  and  wartime  plan  manpower positions.  Line entries contain all the vital information concerning each manpower space such  as  grade,  AFSC,  rated  position  identifiers,  special  experience  identifier,  position number, etc.  The UMD reflects authorized positions only, it does not show the personnel assigned.    The  UMD  is  the  single  source  for  information  about  authorizations (manpower)  each  unit  has  been  allocated  to  perform  its  mission.    The  UMD  contains unique  abbreviations  and  codes  that  depict  relevant  data  pertinent  to  the  unit.  Recognition,  identification  and  proper  use  of  these  codes  are  vital  to  effective  vehicle operations manpower management. 7.2.2.2.  UMDs  are  produced  from  a  database  called  the  Manpower  Programming  and Execution  System  (MPES),  maintained  by  Manpower  and  Organization  (FSS/FSMM) and  your  MAJCOM/A1M  staff.    Changes  are  distributed  to  units  in  the  form  of Authorization  Change  Notices  (ACNs).    UMD  authorization  changes  are  inputted  by Manpower and Organization and forwarded to the MAJCOM/A1M staff for coordination with  the  applicable  MFM.    If  the  MFM  approves  the  change,  the  MAJCOM/A1M  staff 58 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 processes  the  change  for  update  to  the  UMD  in  MPES.    Manpower  and  Organization forwards  a  copy  of  the  approval/disapproval  notice  to  the  requesting  unit.    Review  all UMDs  to  ensure  you  understand  the  changes  made  to  your  unit’s  manpower authorizations. 7.2.2.3.  Budgetary  constraints  affect  authorized  manpower.    Military  and  Civilian Personnel  Flights  assign  personnel  based  on  authorized  manpower  positions.    A  grade imbalance  between  authorized  and  required  manpower  occurs  as  a  result  of  the  Career Progression Group (CPG) program or limits on total military grades.  For example, only one percent of the total enlisted force is Chief Master Sergeants.  HQ USAF implements Congressional grade constraints by creating CPG factors for each AFSC.  MAJCOMs are limited  to  the  grades  derived  by  applying  these  factors  to  the  total  number  of  positions authorized  within  the  appropriate  AFSC.    This  can  result  in  an  insufficient  number  of grades to ideally perform all work requirements, especially from a command perspective.  Nonetheless,  MAJCOMs  are  restricted  to  the  number  of  authorized  grades  derived.  Command  functional  managers  distribute  grades  based  on  priority  of  need.    Grade imbalances  are  determined  by  comparing  the  authorized  (funded)  grade  (GRD)  to  the peacetime  (required)  grade  (RGR).    If  the  authorized  grade  is  lower  than  the  peacetime required grade, you have a grade imbalance. 7.2.2.4.  The UMD reflects required manpower; it does not provide information about the individual(s) filling the authorized position.  Personnel assigned are depicted on the Unit Personnel  Management  Roster  (UPMR).    Questions  concerning  assigned  individuals  or requests for additional personnel  to  fill  existing authorizations should be referred to  the Military or Civilian Personnel Flights. 7.2.2.5.  Many  of  the  codes  on  ACNs,  Authorization  Change  Requests  (ACRs),  and UMD  products  are  not  used  in  the  day-to-day  management  of  manpower  resources.  Contact  the  local  installation  Manpower  Office  for  information  relating  to  specific  data elements and their meanings. 7.2.3.  Current  UPMR:    The  UPMR  is  a  cross  between  an  alpha  roster  and  the  UMD.    It shows the authorized positions with the associated information such as Pos #, DAFSC, Auth Grade, FAC, PAS, required Security Clearance, and RPI codes.  The UPMR also shows who is  assigned  to  each  position  with  personnel  data  items  including:    Name,  SSAN,  assigned DAFSC,  PAFSC,  CAFSC,  2AFSC,  current  Grade,  ETS,  Excess/Over-grade  codes  (if applicable), Technician ID, etc.  This document highlights any mismatches between what is authorized  for  each  position  and  what  the  position  incumbent  has  for  assigned  data.    Each position  is  authorized  one  incumbent,  however  under  some  circumstances  a  second individual could be assigned to a position for a limited period of time.  This is known as an excess condition.  In situations where the incumbent in a position is higher ranking than what is authorized by his/her position an over-grade situation occurs. AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 59 Chapter 8 ELEMENT BUDGETING Section 8A—General Information and Administration 8.1.  Developing  an  Element  Budget:  Develop  and  support  budget  estimates  for  facilities, personnel  and  vehicles  IAW  AFI  65-601v1,  Budget  Guidance  and  Procedures  and  AFI  65-601v2,  Budget  Management  for  Operations.    At  a  minimum,  elements  will  develop  an  annual Financial Plan (FP) to  ensure adequate funding is established and included in the Commanders Statement (Section I) of the FP.  (T-1).  This statement includes assumptions, statements on force changes,  mission  changes,  equipment  changes,  conversions  and  any  other  changes  that  will affect financial requirements.  (T-1).  It also addresses unique problems and states the impact of operating  at  the  level  of  effort  provided  in  the  approved  baseline  program.    Financial Management  sections  may  appoint  specific  managers  for  budgeting  that  states  fixed responsibilities  when  possible.    The  commander  is  ultimately  responsible  for  formulating  and executing the financial plan.   Identify other managers with  their specific financial management responsibilities,  e.g.,  the  civil  engineer  with  real  property  maintenance  and  repair,  the transportation officer with vehicle and transportation requirements.  (T-1). 8.2.  Financial  Plan:  The  DSC/Vehicle  Operations  Element  NCOIC  will  provide  budgetary data  to  leadership  for  inclusion  in  the  LRS  annual  budget  inputs.    (T-1).    The  unit  resource advisor  can  assist  in  determining  the  best  and  most  appropriate  EEIC  as  well  as  provide  other assistance in building the financial plan. 8.3.  Additional  Funding  Venues:  Additional  funds  can  be  sought  for  end  of  year  purchases through  local  fallout  procedures  and/or  unfunded  requests.    Your  squadron/group  Resource Advisor (RA) can assist with these. 8.4.  Financial  Obligations  with  Support  Agreements:  Support  Agreements  are  used  to identify support responsibilities between parties involved, to include financial obligations.  The Vehicle Operations Element NCOIC will assign priorities and services detailed in the agreement IAW  AFI  25-201.    (T-1).    AFI  65-601v1,  also  contains  guidance  for  budgeting  and reimbursement guidance. 8.4.1.  Vehicle  Service  reimbursements  are  based  on  the  Air  Force  Agile  Combat  Support (ACS) concept  (AFDD  Annex 4-0, Combat Support) and the ACS, Capability  Library, and AFI  65-601v1,  paragraph  5.3.    Reimbursements  will  be  sought  from  support  agreements based  on  the  estimated  annual  expenses  identified  in  the  agreement  funding  annex.    (T-1).  The Vehicle Operations Element NCOIC will act as a technical advisor when host-tenant and international agreements are being developed and renewed.  (T-1). 8.4.2.  Determining Responsibility:  IAW AFI 65-601V1, Figure 7.1, if host would normally have had to provide service from assigned vehicles for such transportation then it is a Host Command  responsibility.    Examples  are  routine  shuttle  bus  services,  etc.,  between  work areas, housing, and recreational areas.  If it is outside of currently provided services, Vehicle Operations  Element  NCOIC Installation  Financial Management/Comptroller Officer (FM) in seeking specific determinations. should  work  with the 60 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 8.4.3.  Vehicle Operations Element NCOIC should work with the Installation FM in seeking specific  determinations.    Exceptions  for  consideration  include  units  with  specified  lines  of funding (ex. Medical Group (MDG) and WRM ground transportation). 8.4.4.  IAW DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 11A, ground transportation support to other DoD agencies and  sister  services  are  reimbursable  only  for  the  service  provided,  manpower  will  not  be charged.    (T-1).    Ground  transportation  provided  via  support  agreement  to  other  non-DoD federal  agencies  (i.e.,  FEMA,  NASA,  DoE,  Department  of  Homeland  Security)  are reimbursable for services and manpower.

Documented  Cargo  will  include  delivery  of  supplies  and  equipment,  except  base  service  store items, to base units by using a Time Definite Delivery (TDD) concept.  (T-1).  TDD concept of operations  is  the  standard  for  delivery  of  supplies,  equipment  and  cargo.    It  utilizes  scheduled sweeps  over  designated  routes/areas  of  the  installation.    Frequency  of  scheduled  sweeps  and number of delivery routes/areas is a local determination driven by mission, volume of cargo and customer needs.  Vehicle Operations will tailor sweep frequencies/routes to provide support for primary  mission  of  the  installation/base  for  the  LRS  commander’s  approval.    (T-1).    Delivery frequencies/routes should minimize the need for individual unit delivery requirements. 10.1.1.  Assist Materiel Management Flight (LGRM) Document Control Section in resolving document errors.  LGRM is the overall OPR for all delivery document issues. 10.1.2.  LGRM  will  provide  the  Documented  Cargo  Section  with  copies  of  delivery destinations, unit POCs and the Classified Receipt Listing.   (T-1).  Documented Cargo will ensure current copies are available either automated or hard copy.  (T-1). 10.1.3.  Notify  LGRM  immediately  of  all  unnecessary  delays  caused  by  the  absence  of receiving personnel, incorrect addresses, organizational refusal, improper documentation, etc.  Items precluded from delivery due to these circumstances will be returned to original pickup point for resolution and included on the next scheduled sweep or may be picked up from CM or Aircraft Part Stores (APS) by the customer.  (T-1). 10.1.4.  Ensure all dispatchers and operators are briefed on established procedures to properly dispatch  and  document  cargo  movements,  to  include  processes  for  NWRM,  classified, sensitive, pilferable materiel handling. 10.1.5.  Priority cargo, to include Priority 01 and Priority 02 ISUs, will be delivered as soon as possible (goal is within 30 minutes).  (T-1).  LGRM and CM are responsible for notifying Vehicle  Operations  when  priority  cargo  is  ready  for  delivery  (placed  in  holding  area).  Exception:  Scheduled sweeps may be used if delivery meets customer requirements. 10.1.6.  Priority  cargo/MICAP/NMCS/999  and  classified  cargo,  resulting  from  due-out release (DORs) will be delivered during scheduled sweeps, unless VOCC is contacted for an unscheduled delivery.

(T-1).  If the item is not packaged, then verify item has an AF Form 451, Request for Packing Service in addition to required documents. 10.3.2.2.  Documented Cargo personnel are not responsible for the inspection of the item, packaging or proper completion of the AFTO 350, serviceability tag, DD Form 1348-1A or AMS label.  FSC personnel will take delivery of items and coordinate with the owning unit for discrepancies with packaging and/or documentation.  (T-1). 10.3.3.  Movement  of  cargo  internal  to  a  unit  e.g.,  maintenance  squadrons,  civil  engineer, communication  squadron,  operations  squadrons,  will  remain  a  unit  responsibility.    (T-1).  Vehicle  Operations  will  ensure  cargo  movement  support  for  unit  cargo  does  not  exceed  3 duty days from the initial unit request. 10.3.4.  Residual  workload  (e.g.,  sorting  and  staging  of  cargo,  facilitation  of  customer requirements)  will  remain  the  CM  responsibility.    (T-1).    LGRM,  CM  and  Vehicle Operations will work together to establish a presorting method to accommodate established sweep/route schedules.  (T-1). 10.3.5.  Customers supported by the APS regardless of location are responsible for pickup of their procured items.  Vehicle Operations will deliver oversized items and items to customers that are normally not supported by the APS.  (T-1). 10.3.6.  Items  that  require  signature  must  have  an  authorized  individual’s  signature  on  the pickup or delivery document.

Classified  Receipt  Listing:  The  VOE  will  work  with  the  DSC  to  ensure  the  Classified Receipt Listing identifies only those vehicle operators (2T1s) authorized to receive, handle, and transport classified assets.  (T-1).  The LGRM will be notified within 24 hours or next duty day when  a  vehicle  operator’s  clearance  eligibility  and/or  access  level  is  downgraded  or  changed (loss  of  clearance,  change  in  name,  etc.),  as  designated  by  the  unit  commander  or  proper authority (e.g., Wing Information Protection Office or Unit Security Manager).  (T-1). 10.4.1.  Vehicle Operations Classified Receipt Listing Certification.  The VOE will produce a  memorandum  listing  the  names  of  assigned  personnel  authorized  to  receive,  handle  and transport  classified  assets  and  will  be  kept  with  Vehicle  Operators  while  on  daily  sweeps.  (T-1).    This  listing  will  include  the  names  of  personnel  on  the  Classified  Authorization Listing  but  will  also  contain  the  following  information:    (T-1).    A  statement  certifying  all personnel  on  the  list  have  received  annual  Information  Security  training  and  the  date  of training  for  each  member  listed.    A  statement  certifying  all  personnel  have  read  the Documented  Cargo  OI  detailing  the  handling  instructions  and  movement  procedures  for classified items. 10.5.  Classified  Cargo  Movement  Procedures:  Operators  will  check  all  documentation  to verify  the  classification  of  the  asset/  materiel  prior  to  handling  the  item.    (T-1).    The  operator will  also  ensure  the  paperwork  is  properly  marked  IAW  the  classification  of  the  item.    (T-1).  After  picking  up  the  item,  the  operator  assumes  full  responsibility  for  the  security  of  the classified  asset  and  must  maintain  positive  control  at  all  times.    (T-1).    At  no  time  will  the operator leave the item unattended or out of sight.  (T-1).  The operator will proceed directly to the drop off point for the package.  (T-1). 10.5.1.  Documented  Cargo  will  coordinate  with  the  DSC  to  ensure  the  Classified Authorization  Listing  is  the  most  current  listing  available.    (T-1).    When  performing Documented Cargo operations, operators will carry the Classified Authorization Listing at all times, regardless of whether or not the Asset Management System is used.  (T-1). 10.6.  Classified Cargo Delivery Procedures:  Operators will ensure the item is delivered to the correct organization, as identified by the originator.  (T-1).  Upon delivery, the operator will use the Classified Authorization  Listing  to  verify the  person receiving the package is  authorized to sign/receive classified materiel.  (T-1). 10.6.1.  If  the  receiver  is  not  on  the  Classified  Authorization  Listing  or  the  authority  to receive classified materiel cannot be verified, the operator will contact the VOCC dispatcher immediately.  (T-1).  At no time will the operator leave the package with someone who is not approved to receive classified materiel.  (T-1).  In either case, the new receiver’s authority to receive  classified  will  also  be  verified  using  the  LGRM  Classified  Receipt  Listing.    (T-1).  Operators  will  annotate  the  name,  rank,  duty  phone  and  organization/office  symbol  of  the person signing for the classified materiel and report that information to the dispatcher upon returning to Vehicle Operations.  (T-1). 10.6.2.  A copy of the paperwork, with the receiver’s signature, will be retained for deliveries where  paperwork  is  available  (e.g.,  DD  Form  1348-1A  or  DD  Form  1149,  Requisition  and Invoice/Shipping Document).

Contingency/Wartime  Operations:  As a member of the Expeditionary Combat Airmen (ECA)  grouping,  Air  Force  Vehicle  Operators  require  expeditionary  skills  beyond  what  most Airmen  receive  during  standard  Air  Force  base  level  exercises.    Individual  enlisted  personnel have a joint  responsibility  with  commanders  and  supervisors at  all levels  to  fully develop  their abilities consistent with current and future Air Force, DoD and Federal Emergency Management Administration  needs.    Contingency  Operational  Readiness  Training  (CORT)  was  created  to provide a relevant mix of expeditionary and contingency vehicle operator training. 14.4.1.  Vehicle  Operations  personnel  will  train  on  CORT  tasks  contained  in  the  2T1X1 CFETP,  CDCs,  AFMAN  24-306(I)  and  this  instruction.    (T-1).    Training  will  ensure personnel are able to operate and survive in a contingency or wartime environment as a team.  (T-1).    The  TVO  staff  will  document  all  CORT  actions  using  the  automated  Training Business  Area  (TBA)  system,  if  available.    (T-1).    Document  training  on  AF  Form  1098, AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 91 Special  Task  Certification  and  Recurring  Training  where  TBA  is  not  available.    When personnel  relocate  to  another  unit  or  separate  from  the  Air  Force,  place  a  printout  of  the automated  training  record  or  a  copy  of  AF  Form  1098  in  the  AF  Form  623,  Individual Training  Record.    TBA  will  be  the  standard  system  utilized  for  documenting  individual training  actions  for  Vehicle  Operations  personnel.    (T-1).    There  are  four  phases  to  CORT covering approximately 100 hours of curriculum.  Training will be conducted at least every 2 years.  (T-1). 14.4.2.  To  facilitate  this  training  TVO  will  develop  a  local  Standard  Operating  Procedure that includes a Schedule of Events, Base POC List, Equipment and Vehicle List, map of the designated training area, sample Convoy Manifest and Risk Management Assessment.  (T-1). 14.4.3.  Units  are  authorized  to  incorporate  actual  real-world  events  covered  in  10-2 Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) construct and local wing exercises as part of their CORT.  Examples are:    Implementation of Base Barrier Plan, Random  Access Measures,  Change  of  FPCON,  natural  disaster  response  and  recovery,  Unit  Effectiveness Exercises, Emergency Management Exercises, Air Shows, etc.  TVO will document and file real-world response accomplishments IAW paragraph 14.4.1.  (T-1). Section 14D—Phase I, Common Core Curriculum (Classroom 15 hrs) 14.5.  Phase I:  will focus on tasks outlined in the CFETP and applicable Ability to Survive and Operate  (ATSO)  Guides.    (T-1).    Coverage  of  the  following  topics  will  be  required  to  meet minimum training standards for assigned Vehicle Operations personnel:  (T-1). 14.5.1.  Operation of Manual Shift Vehicles:  Develop local procedures for instruction on the operation of vehicles equipped with manual transmission.  If required, request VM&A recall a  GMV  from  other  on  base  units  or  budget  for  and  request  to  rent/lease  a  vehicle  with  a manual transmission using unit O&M funds.  Ensure adherence to rental/lease administration procedures outlined in Chapter 8.  See AFMAN 24-306(I), for additional information. 14.5.2.  Installation Force Protection Conditions & Base Barrier Plan:  In coordination with the installation Anti-Terrorism  Officer (ATO),  Vehicle Operations will assist  in  developing local  procedures  to  employ  physical  security  measures  to  include  random  antiterrorism measures, the transport of large concentrations of personnel, and movement of distinguished visitors for special events.  (T-1).  This training will include physical security measures that integrate facilities, physical security equipment, trained personnel, and procedures oriented at perimeter  and  area  security,  access  and  egress  control,  protection  from  and  response  to Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  Nuclear,  and  High-Yield  Explosives  (CBRNE)  attacks, High-Risk  Personnel  protection,  ATO  barrier  plans,  and  facility  standoff  distances.    (T-1).  Consult DoDI 2000.16, AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism, and the installation CEMP 10-2. 14.5.3.  Bare Base Set-up and Operational Procedures (to include establishing command and control,  communication,  reception  and  bed  down  of  personnel,  accounting  and  control  of personnel, equipment, facilities, securing and controlling required resources):  Personnel will be  provided  basic  defensive  concepts  to  ensure  their  ability  to  maintain  at  least  minimum defensive control of life and resources.  (T-1).  Consult AFH 10-222v2, Guide to Bare Base Assets, AFPAM 10-219v5, Bare Base Conceptual Planning, and local Base Support Plan. 92 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 14.5.4.  RM & Comprehensive Airman Fitness (Resiliency) Training:  Vehicle operators will integrate RM into CORT activities and mission planning, ensuring decisions are based upon risk assessments of the planned operation/activity.  (T-1).  As risk is inherent in all missions, operations and activities, both on- and off-duty Air Force RM Core Concepts and Processes will  be  reviewed,  briefed  and  documented.    (T-1).    In  addition,  resiliency  competencies, practices  and  local  support  agency  services  will  be  incorporated  into  CORT  curriculum  as extended  periods  of  high  ops  tempo  or  brief  periods  of  intense  operations  will  degrade individual and team performance.  (T-1).  Consult AFI 44-172, Mental Health, and AFI 90-802, Risk Management. Section 14E—Phase II, Career Field Specific Curriculum (Classroom 20 hrs) 14.6.  Phase  II:  will  focus  on    basic  war  fighting  skills  and  areas  of  knowledge  required  to successfully complete the Air Force ground transportation mission.  (T-1). 14.6.1.  Command  and  Control  of  Vehicle  Operations  Resources  -  Personnel,  Vehicles, Equipment  &  Facilities:    Training  will  provide  vehicle  operators  with  theory  and  hands  on training to perform safe and efficient winching, tow bar operations, and A-Frame Recovery. (T-1).  With approval, vehicles may be withdrawn from DLA-DS to prevent damage to serviceable assets.  Safety precautions will be taken to avoid personal injury.  Units are required to incorporate procedures for 24-hr shift coverage, tracking personnel on and off duty, and vehicle accountability.  (T-1).  Vehicle operators will be instructed on resource protection and facility/compound procedures to include damage assessment/repair priorities, passive/active defense, rally points, evacuation routes and location of alternate work centers.  (T-1).  Consult DoDM 4500.36, AFI 24-301, AFI 24-302, and FM 4-30.31 formerly listed as TO 36-1-181, Recovery and Battle Damage Assessment Repair. to  adapt 14.6.2.  Field Expedient Repairs:  Training must provide the necessary knowledge required to complete  the  mission  without  the  use  of  everyday  in-garrison  resources.    (T-1).    This  will enable  operators to  surrounding  environment  during  contingency/wartime operations.    (T-1).    Operators  will  be  trained  on  the  following  procedures;  substitutes  for jacks, methods for raising an axle, use of a skid, dead man anchor, substitutes for tire chains, engine  failure  during  field  operations,  shorted  distributor  cap,  frozen  fuel  line,  leaking  fuel line, fuel pump vapor lock, punctured radiator/fuel tank and broken fan belt.  (T-1).  Consult AFMAN 24-306(I) and FM 4-30.31. 14.6.3.  Peacetime,  Contingency  &  Combat  Convoy  Operations:    While  administrative, contingency  (humanitarian  relief)  and  tactical  convoys  are  similar,  they  differ  in  makeup, procedures, and execution.  To facilitate this wide range of procedures, convoy training will include all three types of convoys.  (T-1).  Consult AFMAN 24-306(I) and AFTTP(I) 3-2.58, Multi-service Tactical, Techniques, and Procedures for Tactical Convoy Operations. 14.6.3.1.  Manage  licensing  and  qualifications  on  local  vehicles  (i.e.,  M-series  and commercial vehicles, foreign-made or host-nation vehicles, and assets commonly used in contingency locations). 14.6.3.2.  Conduct  training  on  vehicle  Preventive  Maintenance  Checks  and  Servicing (PMCS),  control  signals,  proper  speed  and  interval,  asset  recovery,  convoy  halts  and AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 93 discipline,  Lead  Vehicle  Navigation,  use  of  Global  Positioning  Systems  and  positive control of sensitive items as required. 14.6.3.3.  Develop  and  demonstrate  convoy  Tactics,  Techniques  and  Procedures  along with Rules of Engagement. 14.6.3.4.  Develop  and  manage  convoy  routes,  manifests,  and  procedures.    This  will include using local INTEL reports to maintain accurate data.  (T-1).  For peacetime and contingency  convoys  incorporate  commercial/civilian  sources  for  road  construction, disaster  area  detours,  approved  host-nation  routes,  DoD/FEMA/Civic  Government approved logistics support centers and Safe Havens along with major transportation hubs such as airports, train stations, freight terminals and port facilities. 14.6.3.5.  Develop reverse timeline to ensure cargo preparation and delivery is on-time. 14.6.3.6.  Conduct and brief risk assessment to convoy commanders. 14.6.3.7.  Conduct convoy briefs (pre- and post-mission). 14.6.3.8.  Conduct  convoy  mission  check  rides  (route  situational  awareness,  geographic landmarks, common route attack areas, communication dead zones, call-in marks/contact Security, Landowner, MEDEVAC, etc.). 14.6.4.  Vehicle  Camouflage  &  Dispersal:    Vehicle  operators  must  know  the  principles  of vehicle camouflage, concealment, and dispersal.  (T-1).  Vehicle concealment techniques are critical in protecting assets from enemy forces from ground and air.  Provide instruction on different  types  of  camouflaging  techniques.    Training  must  include,  but  is  not  limited  to, stationary vehicle camouflage and concealment, camouflage screen system, and camouflage screen  over  vehicles.  (T-1).    When  operating  in  areas  that  have  been  or  are  expected  to  be exposed to chemical weapons, do not use camouflage as it becomes an exposure hazard and disposal liability.  Dispersal of vehicles is a pre-enemy attack action that reduces the damage to  and  destruction  of  vehicles.    Consult  AFH  10-222v10,  Civil  Engineer  Camouflage, Concealment,  and  Deception  Measures  and  AFPAM  10-219v5,  Bare  Base  Conceptual Planning. 14.6.5.  Night  Vision  Goggle  (NVG)  &  Operations  Under  Blackout  Conditions:    Provide vehicle operators with basic knowledge required to operate vehicles in a safe manner while utilizing NVGs.  Vehicle operators require training on the general characteristics, operational characteristics,  PMCS  of  NVGs,  proper  focus,  driving  in  night  vision  goggles  and  convoy operations.  Vehicle operators must be provided with the knowledge required to operate in a safe  and  proficient  manner  under  blackout  conditions.    (T-1).    Blackout  operation  training must  include  proper  speed  and  gap,  blackout  marker  lights,  blackout  driving  lights,  safety while operating under blackout  conditions  and blacking out  a non M-series vehicle.   (T-1).  Actual nighttime vehicle blackout training will only be conducted in controlled areas that do not permit exposure to civilian traffic.  (T-1).  Consult AFMAN 24-306(I). Section 14F—Phase III, Emergency Management (EM) Program and HAZMAT/Munitions Transport (Classroom 15 hrs) 14.7.  Phase  III:  Will  focus  on  primary  missions  of  the  Air  Force  EM  program;  to  save  lives, minimize  the  loss  or  degradation  of  resources,  and  continue,  sustain,  and  restore  operational 94 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 capability in an all-hazards physical threat environment at Air Force installations worldwide.  (T-1).   The ancillary missions of the Air Force EM program  are to  support homeland defense and civil support operations and to provide support to civil and host nation authorities according to DoD  directives  and  through  the  appropriate  Combatant  Command.    During  emergency  and contingency operations vehicle operators will often be tasked to handle, transport and safeguard HAZMAT and munitions. 14.7.1.  Emergency Services Function (ESF) 1 & 7:  The installation Emergency Operations Center  (EOC)  incorporates  15  unique  ESFs.    These  functions  provide  the  structure  for coordinating  installation  strategic  interagency  support  during  all  phases  of  incident management  for  major  accidents,  natural  disasters  (to  include  natural  outbreaks  of  disease such  as  pandemic  influenza),  CBRNE  attacks,  and  terrorist  use  of  CBRNE  materials.    The ESF  structure  includes  mechanisms  used  to  provide  support  to  the  installation  and,  if required, to local, State, Federal agencies and host-nation governments.  The type and scope of the event will determine the magnitude and timing of the support provided by each ESF. 14.7.1.1.  ESF  1,  Transportation:    This  ESF  is  manned  by  Vehicle  Operations  (2T1) personnel.    Their  primary  job  is  to  process  and  coordinate  emergency  requests  for installation,  local,  MAJCOM,  HAF  and  host-nation  transportation  support  as  directed under the installation CEMP 10-2. 14.7.1.2.  ESF  7,  Resource  Support:    Typically  this  function  is  manned  with  a  Material Management Specialist (2S); however, 2T1 personnel may serve in this position when the unit is short on personnel or when the event/scenario does not require multiple Logistics Readiness AFSC representation.  ESF 7 provides critical operational assistance to support Federal,  State,  local  and  host-nation  response  agencies  requiring  resource  support  prior to, during and/or after EM incidents. 14.7.1.3.  Vehicle  operators  will  be  provided  an  overview  of  local  ESF  1  and  7 responsibilities,  resources,  governing  checklists,  internal  procedures,  location  of  the primary/secondary EOC and unit POCs.  (T-1).  See AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management  Program  Planning  and  Operations.  AFMAN  10-2502,  Air  Force  Incident Management  System  Standards  and  Procedures,  and  AFMAN  10-2504,  Air  Force Incident Management Guidance for Major Accidents and Natural Disasters. 14.7.2.  Non-Combatant  Evacuation  Operations  (NEO)/Safe  Haven  &  Shelter  Stocking:  Vehicle  Operations  plays  a  crucial  role  in  supporting  the  Airman  and  Family  Readiness Center NEO and Safe Haven programs.  This may include evacuation efforts in conjunction with  US  Civil  Authorities,  US  Department  of  State  and  host-nation  civic  groups.  Traditionally  this  support  includes  ground  movement  of  dependents,  personal  baggage, medical supplies, food and water in support of base staging and reception areas and overland to other military and commercial transportation hubs.  On rare occasion Vehicle Operations is directed to recover, secure and account for POVs left on the installation. 14.7.2.1.  NEO  is  an  operation  conducted  to  evacuate  civilians  from  another  country, generally  due  to  a  deteriorating  security  situation  or  natural  disaster.    Additionally,  this may  include  nonessential  military  personnel,  selected  host-nation  citizens,  and  third country nationals whose lives are in danger from locations in a host foreign nation to an appropriate  safe  haven  and/or  the  United  States.    The  US  Ambassador  is  the  senior AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 95 authority for the evacuation and is ultimately responsible for the successful completion of the operation and the safety of the evacuees. 14.7.2.2.  Safe  Haven  is  a  temporary  place  of  refuge  to  which  noncombatants  may  be evacuated  to  during  an  international  or  domestic  emergency.    It  is  considered  a  staging area  where  evacuees  may  be  afforded  medical  care,  substance  and  follow-on transportation to the United States or other foreign countries. 14.7.2.3.  Shelter Stocking is the movement of commissary stocks and other sustainment or  disaster  relief  items  for  protective  shelters,  designated  shelter-in-place  locations  and on-  /off-base  recovery  staging  areas.    The  installation  Shelter  Management  Team  will typically  coordinate  requests  through  ESF  1/7  for  movement  of  base  food  stocks  and other Services related re-supply actions. 14.7.2.4.  Vehicle  operators  will  be  provided  an  overview  of  local  NEO,  Safe  Haven  & Shelter  Stocking  if  applicable  to  their  installation.    (T-1).    This  will  include responsibilities,  resources,  governing  checklists,  internal  procedures,  location  of  the primary/secondary  shelters  and  special  team  POCs.    (T-1).    Consult  AFI  10-216, Evacuating and Repatriating Air Force Family Members and Other US Noncombatants, AFH  10-247v1,  Guide  to  Services  Contingency  Planning:    Beddown,  AFI  24-301,  and your local Base Support Plan. 14.7.3.  Military  Operations  Other  Than  War  (MOOTW)/Natural  Disaster  Ground Transportation  Support:    The  Air  Force  is  often  tasked  to  perform  MOOTW  that  do  not involve the use or threat of force.  This includes humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in foreign  countries,  the  United  States  and  its  territories.    MOOTW  may  include  deterring potential aggressors, protecting national interests and support to the United Nations.  Natural disasters include: severe weather such as tornados, floods, thunderstorms, extreme cold and heat,  hurricanes,  typhoons,  tsunamis,  earthquakes,  fires,  volcanoes,  and  any  other  natural weather phenomena.  Because natural disasters can simultaneously impact both installations and  civil  authorities’  jurisdiction  outside  the  installation,  it  is  important  to  understand  that there  are  multiple  military  and  non-military  organizations  involved  in  disaster  response planning and execution.  The Air Force Incident Management program is comprised of four phases of incident management; Prevention, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery.  Vehicle Operations will be heavily involved in all four phases.  (T-1).  The LRS will be called upon to provide sufficient numbers of vehicle operators to safely transport relief supplies, injured personnel, mission critical assets and equipment.  (T-1). 14.7.3.1.  Vehicle operators will be provided an overview of local CEMP 10-2 checklists, shelter-in-place  procedures  and  equipment,  protection  of  vehicles/fuel/facilities,  route-reconnaissance of primary and secondary evacuation and resupply routes, appointment of special teams and shift schedules that identify long-term personnel requirements.  (T-1).  Use  AFI  10-229,  Responding  to  Severe  Weather  Events,  and  AFMAN  10-2504,  Air Force  Incident  Management  Guidance  for  Major  Accidents  and  Natural  Disasters,  for CORT planning and lesson plan development. 14.7.4.  Emergency  Management  Incidents  &  Contingency  Support:    Similar  to  natural disaster  training,  vehicle  operators  will  be  provided  an  overview  on  local  response  and ground transportation requirements in support of emergency and contingency incidents such as major accidents, aircraft crashes, nuclear accidents, chemical spills, personnel search and 96 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 recovery, mass casualty recovery, mortuary support and biological/terror attacks.  (T-1).  Use the  following  documents  to  develop  local  training  requirements:    AFH  10-247v4,  Guide  to Services  Contingency  Planning:  Mortuary  Affairs  Search  and  Recovery,  AFMAN  10-2503, Operations  in  a  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  Nuclear,  and  High-Yield  Explosive (CBRNE)  Environment,  AFMAN  10-2504,  Air  Force  Incident  Management  Guidance  for Major  Accidents  and  Natural  Disasters,  and  local  Base  Support  Plan  and  CEMP  10-2 checklists. 14.7.5.  HAZMAT/Munitions Transport & Safeguarding Cargo/Security Awareness:  Provide vehicle operators with basic knowledge required to identify, load, unload and safely handle HAZMAT and munitions.  This training will include safety measures identified in the locally developed  and  approved  safety  program  to  include  use  of  warning  signs,  vehicle  placards, fire  extinguishers,  authorized  storage  locations,  marshaling  yards,  primary  and  secondary routes,  and  on-  /off-base  emergency  contact  numbers.    (T-1).    Once  HAZMAT  and/or munitions are loaded, the vehicle operator becomes responsible for maintaining the security of  the  shipment.    As  a  part  of  a  comprehensive  strategy  to  protect  the  United  States  from future  terrorist  attacks,  the  DoT  has  added  a  number  of  security  requirements  to  its HAZMAT  regulations.    As  part  of  these  changes,  all  entities  that  transport  or  cause  the transportation of hazardous materials must provide security training for their employees.  (T-1).    As  such,  vehicle  operators  will  train  on  internal  security  measures  for  keeping  their compound and facilities safe and secure; identify how HAZMAT will be safeguarded during the  transportation  process;  the  security  responsibilities  of  truck  drivers  who  transport HAZMAT  and  the  security  responsibilities  of  employees  who  load/unload  deliveries  of HAZMAT.    (T-1).    CORT  lesson  plans  covering  HAZMAT,  munitions  and  security awareness  will  be  developed  using  the  49  CFR,  US  Army  AMMO  67  Computer  Based Training Program, DD Form 2890, DoD Multimodal Dangerous Goods Declaration, AFI 24-210, Package of Hazardous Material, DD Form 626, Motor Vehicle Inspection (Transporting Hazardous Materials), AFI 91-203, and AFMAN 91-201.  (T-1). 14.7.6.  Basic  Expeditionary  Airfield  Resources  (BEAR)  Base/Steady  State  Deployed Vehicle Operations:  Operations in a contingency environment will expose vehicle operators to many situations and problems that would not be encountered in normal in-garrison day-to-day operations.  (T-1).  Contingency situations are difficult to predict and it is impossible to totally  prepare  vehicle  operators  for  all  the  tasks  and  complex  problems  that  may  arise  in each situation.  Consequently, deployed personnel must be prepared to support the following expeditionary situations:  (T-1). 14.7.6.1.  Support  aircrew  (transient  and  home  station)  transportation  requirements:  Example:    Vehicle  Operations  provides  aircrew  support  to  all  deployed  aircrew  as dictated by the expeditionary commander.  (T-1). 14.7.6.2.  Inter-/Intra-base  movement  of  cargo:    Example:    Vehicle  Operations  provides tractor/trailer service to support cargo movements during various real world deployments (i.e., movement of disabled vehicles to DLA-DS staging areas, MREs, inbound/outbound aircraft departures and arrivals). 14.7.6.3.  Provide  transportation  support  to  move  WRM  supplies  and  equipment  for deployment.    Example:    Tractor/trailer  support  is  provided  to  transport  any  necessary supplies and equipment to sustain organizational war fighting capabilities. AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 97 14.7.6.4.  Operation  of  MHE  in  support  of  aircraft  loading  and  unloading  operations beyond  the  capability  of  the  air  terminal:    Support  includes  providing  qualified  tractor and trailer operators as necessary.  Example:  Vehicle Operations provides fully qualified tractor-trailer  and  MHE  operators  to  assist  the  Cargo  Deployment  Function  (CDF)  in aircraft loading and downloading.  This occurs on a regular basis during wing exercises and real world deployment and redeployment operations. 14.7.6.5.  Vehicle recovery operations:  Collects attrition support vehicles i.e., personally owned  vehicles,  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Services  vehicles,  Non-Appropriated Funded  vehicles  and  host  nation  provided  vehicles.    Retrieves  disabled  vehicles  for transport  to  vehicle  management,  and  provides  emergency  removal  services  to  clear runways  and  access  roads.    Example:    Most  Vehicle  Operations  have  retrieval  vehicles within the fleet; i.e., 5-ton or rollback wreckers.  Disabled vehicles are removed from the flight  line  and  access  areas  as  directed.    Operators  will  also  work  closely  with  SFS  to remove vehicles identified for impound.  (T-1). 14.7.6.6.  Support  line-haul  transportation  requirements:    This  provides  vehicles  and Expeditionary  Combat  Airmen  (ECA)  qualified  vehicle  operators  as  necessary  to  meet DoD and Air Force line-haul requirements.  Example:  Convoy operations; preparations for  aircraft  recovery  to  transport  large  amounts  of  supplies  and  equipment  to  sustain operations  at  remote  locations  (see  AFMAN  24-306(I)).    Line-hauling  is  a  life  line  of necessary supplies transported to sustain an installations war fighting capabilities.  ECA vehicle  operators  are  required  to  be  HAZMAT  and  tractor/trailer  qualified  in  order  to support the mass movement of supplies and hazardous cargo. 14.7.6.7.  Determines  critical  VOCC  vehicle  shortfalls  and  reports  requirements  to  the LRS/UCC.  Example:  VOCC will track and maintain all assigned vehicles.  The current status  of  these  will  be  tracked  using  OLVIMS  Dispatch  Module,  graphs,  letters  or pictorials.    Vehicle  status  is  reported  during  exercise/operations  as  required  by contingency  checklists.    Shortfalls  can  hamper  an  operations  ability  to  sustain  war fighting capabilities.  It is very important to maintain accountability of vehicle assets and report information for corrective action. 14.7.6.8.  Maintain a current status on all VOCC dispersed vehicles.  Example:  SORTS report provided to LRS Readiness Element monthly and/or vehicle status board in VOCC for tracking and quick identification. 14.7.6.9.  PMCS  and  operation  of  M-Series  tactical  vehicles  such  as  2.5-ton  or  5-ton cargo  trucks  (e.g.,  M-998,  M-35,  M-923,  M-1083,  M-1078,  M-1088,  M-915).    If  M-Series assets are not assigned to the Vehicle Operations fleet, units will request assistance from  VM&A  to  recall  base  M-Series  assets  or  coordinate  with  local  Army  and  Air National Guard units equipped with the applicable vehicles.  (T-1). Section 14G—Phase IV, Operational Training Exercise (Field 50 hrs) 14.8.  Phase IV:  will culminate in a local operational training exercise applying classroom skills taught  during  Phase  I,  II  &  III.    (T-1).    This  training  will  require  vehicle  operators  to  apply individual and team skills that test MOOTW and expeditionary scenarios.  (T-1).  Efforts should be  made  to  seek  participation  by  Vehicle  Management,  Prime  BEEF,  Prime  RIBS,  Security 98 AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 Forces,  and  regional  Army  Transportation  Company  personnel  as  their  duty  schedules  permit.  Vehicle Operations Elements that are geographically close to other Air Force Vehicle Operations Elements are encouraged to pool together and share resources, personnel and training locations.) 14.8.1.  CORT  Phase  IV  will,  at  a  minimum,  include  SABC,  9-line  MEDEVAC  and  IED notification messages, vehicle winching theories, field expedient repairs, night vision goggle driving and operations under blackout  conditions.   (T-1).  Additionally, Vehicle Operations will conduct at least one actual convoy utilizing all skills taught in paragraph 14.6.3.4.  (T-1).  To fulfill this requirement units may choose to do a tactical based convoy using M-Series assets or a MOOTW based scenario using assigned commercial vehicles. 14.8.2.  Vehicle  operators  will  receive  training  on  convoy  security  and  "Sector  Defense"  or Owner/User  operations.    (T-1).    The  training  will  emphasize  selection  and  construction  of defensive  firing  positions,  movement  to  defensive  firing  positions,  and  reacting  to  attacks.  (T-1).    The  primary  duty  weapon  will  be  utilized  during  Phase  IV  of  CORT  to  enhance realism and familiarize students with the tools necessary to ensure mission accomplishment.  (T-1).    Consult  the  LRS  Material  Management  Flight,  Mobility  Section  to  arrange  for weapons  issue.    Consider  date,  time,  type,  quantity  and  transport  vehicle  required.    Use Tactical  Convoy  Operations,  AFTTP(I)  3-2.58  as  a  guide  along  with  AFCAT  21-209v1, Ground Munitions, and AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel. Section 14H—Counter-Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Procedures 14.9.  General  Information.  Actual  operations  prove  that  response  actions  conducted  during training  are  also  done  during  warfare.    A  vehicle  operator  must  be  trained  to  know  what  to  do when driving in a CBRN environment.  (T-1). 14.9.1.  For additional guidance, see AFTTP 3-2.60, Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Decontamination, AFTTP 3-4, Airman’s Manual, AFMAN 10-2503, Operations in a Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  Nuclear,  and  High-Yield  Explosive  (CBRNE) Environment,  the  Installation  Emergency  Management  Plan  (IEMP)  10-2  and  AFMAN  24-306, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Operator. 14.9.2.  The  Civil  Engineer  Readiness  and  Emergency  Management  Flight  can  provide assistance on CBRN defense actions and help functional area experts develop TTP to support specific operations.

All DoD sedans and most station wagons are included. Base  Sponsored—Base  sponsored  is  defined  as  an  activity  approved  by  the  installation commander and open/available to the entire installation. Competing  with  commercial  services—Competing  with  commercial  services  happens  when Air  Force  establishes  transportation  services  similar  to  established  commercial  services.  Establishment  of  transportation  routes  reasonably  serviced  by  commercial  services  are considered  as  competing  with  commercial  services.    The  occasional  use  of  GMVs  over  these routes  for  training,  proficiency,  or  military  necessity  are  not  considered  in  competition  with commercial  services.    These  include  all  types  of  transportation  services,  i.e.,  passenger  and cargo. Dependent  School  Children  (United  States  Only)—Those  minor  dependents,  of  DoD personnel  and  of  members  of  other  Federal  agencies  when  specifically  indicated,  attending primary or secondary schools, including kindergarten (or primary or junior primary, etc.) where this  group  or  class:    (1)  Is  conducted  during  the  regular  school  year  to  provide  educational experiences  for  the  year  immediately  preceding  the  first  grade.    (2)  Is  under  the  control  of  the local public board authority having administrative control and direction of free public education in a county, township, independent or other school district within a state. Direct  Mission  Support—Commercial  design  vehicles  used  by  military  activities  directly supporting combat or tactical units, or for training of personnel for such activities. DoD Dependent Student (Overseas Only)—A minor student who:  (1) Is a dependent of a DoD sponsor,  or  who  is  a  resident  in  the  household  of  a  DoD  sponsor  who  stands  in  loco  parentis (resides with) to such an individual and who receives one-half or more of his or her support from such  a  sponsor.    (2)  Is  authorized  transportation  at  US  Government  expense  to  or  from  an overseas area, if the DoD sponsor is military; or is an authorized member of the household of a DoD sponsor entitled to a living quarter’s allowance, as authorized by the Department  of State Standardized Regulations and DoDD 1400.25 if the sponsor is a civilian.  (3) Has not completed secondary school and who will reach his or her 5th birthday, but not 21st birthday by December 31st  of  the  current  school  year;  or  is  handicapped  and  is  between  3  and  5  years  of  age  by AFI24-301  5 MAY 2016 111 December 31st of the current school year, provided the Director, DoDDS, or designee, in his or her  sole  discretion,  determines  that  adequate  staff  and  facilities  are  available  to  serve  such  a handicapped child; or is a preschool aged child who will be 4 years of age by December 31st of the  current  school  year,  provided  that  the  Director,  DoDDS,  or  designee,  in  his  or  her  sole discretion, determines that adequate staff and facilities are available to serve such a child. Domicile—A place of residence, regardless of where located, excluding TDY residences. Emergency  Response  Forces—A  group  organized  or  available  for  a  certain  purpose  with specialized  vehicles  to  support  the  Air  Force  mission.    Example  would  be  Fire  Department personnel and assigned fire trucks or Security Force personnel and assigned patrol vehicles. Employee—An  employee  of  an  agency  in  either  the  competitive  or  excepted  service  or  an enrollee of the Job Corps established by Title 42 U.S.C. § 102. Expeditionary  Combat  Airmen—Airmen  that  are  expected  to  operate  routinely  in  the  close battle space.  Their efforts are mostly defensive in nature.  Included in ECA are certain AFSCs (i.e.,  Security  Forces  and  OSI),  some  organizations like  Air  Support  Operations Groups/Squadrons  and  Contingency  Response  Groups,  and  various  Unit  Type  Codes  (i.e., Vehicle  Operations,  Vehicle  Management,  Engineers,  Medics)  dependent  upon  the  threat  and mission  at  the  deployed  location.    ECA  “live  inside  the  fence,”  but  regularly  go  “outside  the fence”  to  perform  their  duties.    The  expeditionary  combat  skill  set  needed  is  beyond  that  of Expeditionary Airmen, but not as significant and extensive as the Battlefield Airman. Field Work—Work performed by an employee whose position requires the employee's presence at  various locations that  are  at  a significant  distance from the employee's place of employment (itinerant type travel).  The designation of a work site as a "field office" does not, of itself, permit the use of a government passenger carrier for transportation. Gross  Vehicle  Weight  Rating  (GVWR)—Is  normally  found  on  the  vehicle/equipment  data plate as GVWR.  The gross vehicle weight rating or gross vehicle mass (GVM) is the maximum operating  weight/mass  of  a  vehicle  as  specified  by  the  manufacturer  including  the  vehicle's chassis, body, engine, engine fluids, fuel, accessories, driver, passengers and cargo. Group Transportation—A service generally limited to those situations where there is a need to move personnel from within or outside installations, and for which a fare is normally charged. Handicapped  Children—Children  who  have  been  evaluated  and  classified  by  competent authority  as  being  mentally  handicap/disabled,  hard  of  hearing,  deaf,  speech  impaired,  visually handicapped,  seriously  emotionally  disturbed,  orthopedically  impaired,  other  health  impaired, deaf-blind,  multiple  handicapped  or  having  specific  learning  disabilities  and  who,  because  of those impairments, need special education, and related services.
