Introduction.  This  instruction  establishes  minimum  requirements  to  ensure  AF  weather personnel  are  adequately  trained  to  achieve  and  maintain  position  qualification  and  Mission Ready  (MR)/Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR)  status.    MR/CMR  is  used  to  designate  mission readiness  status  for  personnel  who  have  completed  Qualification  Training  and  are  postured against a designated expeditionary mission.  Fundamental elements of weather specialty training are  standardized to  ensure  common  presentation  of  weather  capabilities  worldwide.  Commanders of units with weather personnel assigned are responsible for qualification training of the weather personnel under their command. 1.2.  Policies.  The  unique  weather  training  and  associated  standards  identified  herein  ensure effective and efficient employment of AF weather capabilities in the performance of peacetime and  contingency  duties  and  responsibilities.    This  instruction  directs  a  functional  training program  according  to  AFI  36-2201.    Each  organization’s  weather  training  program  will  be defined in local procedures, as required.  (T-3).  Chapter 2 and 3 define steps to achieve weather position  (duty)  qualification  and  expeditionary  MR/CMR  status,  respectively.    Commanders tailor  local  training  procedures  to  meet  the  operational  mission  requirements  based  on  position qualification and expeditionary mission requirements, as required.  HQ USAF/A3W establishes, validates  and  communicates  training,  equipment,  communications,  and  other  requirements  to conduct  weather  operations  and  provide  weather  services  in  support  of  the  Army  according  to Army  Regulation  (AR)  115-10/AFI  15-157  (IP),  Weather  Support  and  Services  for  the  U.S. Army.    Weather  personnel  supporting  the  Army  often  require  training  by  sister  service organizations to gain task and subject proficiency (e.g., combat skills training, Army individual and  organizational  equipment).    The  CFETP  provides  references  to  training  resources  and documents required levels of task training proficiency. 1.2.1.

Position Qualification Training (QT).  Position QT readies an Airman for a specific duty position.    For  Initial  Skills  Course  (ISC)  graduates  at  their  first  permanent  duty  station  as  a weather Airman, completing mandatory distance learning blocks as the first step to occupational development  takes  precedence  over  position  QT;  however,  elements  of  position  QT  can  occur concurrently  while  completing  this  training.    The  mandatory  distance  learning  blocks  for  new enlisted 3-levels are located in the Weather Operations section of the ADLS Gateway to provide standardized training.  For all other weather Airmen, position QT begins following, or concurrent with,  in-processing  actions.  An individual is  considered position qualified once determined by the organization’s leadership, independent of UGT, upon confirmation by the certifying official that  the  trainee  has  satisfied  position  qualification  requirements  to  include  successfully completing  applicable  duty  position  checkrides.    Upon  award  of  position  qualification,  the member is qualified to work the duty position independently. 2.1.1.  All weather personnel that are position qualified will recertify annually.  (T-1). 2.1.2.  Personnel  that  perform  garrison  airfield  weather  services  must  be  task-certified  to produce  surface  weather  observations  and  complete  a  position  qualification  tailored  to  the airfield  location.    Personnel  who  are  tasked  to  fill  UTCs  that  include  a  surface  weather observing  capability  must  also  be  task-certified  on  surface  weather  observations  (see paragraph  3.1.1.1).  (T-1). 2.1.3.  Units  performing  weather  prediction  tasks  within  or  for  tropical  latitudes  will designate a minimum of one tropical subject-matter expert (SME) according to AFI 36-2201.  This  SME  will  complete the  Tropical  Weather  Analysis  and  Forecast  Course (EOZW15W30A1A), or a similar education course.  This SME will ensure tropical weather forecasting  rules  and  techniques  are  integrated  into  local  weather  processes,  seasonal recurring training (see paragraph  4.1.3), and qualification training/certification.  (T-1). 2.1.4.  DELETED 2.1.5.  All weather Airmen will complete initial position QT within 120 days of their training start  date  (240  days  for  ISC  graduates  to  account  for  the  initial  120  days  allotted  for  the mandatory distance learning blocks). (T-2).    Exception: ANG and AFRC personnel not on active  duty  will  complete  initial  position  QT  within  one  year  of  assignment.  (T-2).    Note: The  time  allotments  above  apply  to  a  member’s  primary  duty  position  qualification  that includes CFETP-identified core tasks and results in an Airman who is qualified to work their primary  position  independently.    Where  multiple  duty  positions  exist,  commanders  will develop internal timelines to qualify members in additional positions. (T-2). 2.1.6.  Those  personnel  receiving  Permanent  Change  of  Station  orders  to  NATO  positions will complete the mandatory training before assignment according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of  Staff  Instruction  (CJCSI)  1210.01,  Joint  Orientation  Training  for  U.S.  Personnel Assigned to NATO Organizations.  (T-0). 2.1.7.  Advanced  Weather  Managers  Course  (AWMC).    The  AWMC  is  a  one-time  career requirement for operational weather leadership supporting AF and Army units. AFI15-127  20 JANUARY 2016 11 2.1.7.1.  Master  Sergeants  (and  selects)  who  have  received  a  Deliberate  Development Board  Tier  II  or  III  vector  will  attend  AWMC.    Members  selected  for  assignment  to  a Tier II or III position are given attendance priority. (T-2). 2.1.7.2.  Company  grade  officers,  upon  notification  of  assignment  to  a  weather flight/detachment, will attend AWMC. (T-2). 2.1.8.  All  personnel  assigned  to  weather  parachutist  manning  positions  (AFSCs  J15WX  or J1W0X1) will be volunteers for parachutist duty, complete an initial qualification course and maintain currency according to AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute Operations.  The gaining MAJCOM  or  the  supported  Army  unit  (see  AR  115-10/AFI  15-157  [IP])  funds  initial qualification course. 12 AFI15-127  20 JANUARY 2016 Chapter 3 MISSION READINESS 3.1.  Mission  Readiness/Combat  Mission  Readiness  (MR/CMR)  Training.  MR/CMR training  is  designed  to  ensure  weather  personnel  achieve  MR/CMR  status  to  perform  UTC-specific weather tasks in support of their assigned organization’s wartime and AEF taskings, and should occur concurrently with position QT.  For active component Airmen, to include Airmen aligned with enabler UTCs, all applicable initial MR/CMR training requirements must be met no later  than  180  days  after  an  individual’s  position  QT  start  date  or  the  end  of  a  pre-deployment window of an individual’s first deployment eligibility period (when applicable); whichever date is  earliest.  (T-1).    Exception:  Some  UTC  tasks  reliant  on  outside  organizations  may  not  be available  until  tasked.    See  paragraph    3.3  for  additional  MR/CMR  exceptions  for  overseas remote duty locations. 3.1.1.  MR/CMR training will consist of the following: 3.1.1.1.  Weather  personnel  must  be  trained  and  certified  on  all  mandatory  AFSC  core and UTC tasks as identified in the CFETP  (T-1), and any local requirements defined in the MTP.  (T-3).  Weather personnel assigned against non-weather UTCs (e.g., 7E-, 7FV-,  or  3F-series)  will  be  evaluated  against  applicable  UTC  training  (either  XWQA1 orXWQA2)  STS  line  items  in  addition  to  position  qualification  supporting  a  specific aircraft/mission design series.  (T-2). 3.1.1.2.  AF-directed ancillary deployment training requirements according to AFI 10403, Deployment  Planning  and  Execution,  (e.g.,  Law  of  Armed  Conflict,  self-aid  and  buddy care,  small  arms  qualification,  etc.).    Additionally,  weather  personnel  providing  Army combat  support  complete  unique  training  identified  in  AFI  36-2654,  Combat  Arms Program, and AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel. 3.1.1.3.  ANG  and  AFRC  will  schedule  personnel  tasked  with  a  deployment  for MR/CMR training during their pre-deployment training phase.  (T-1). 3.1.2.  Unit  leadership  awards  initial  MR/CMR  status  after  the  certifier  confirms  that  the member  has  satisfied  all  applicable  qualification  and  training  requirements  and  is  fully qualified  to  perform  the  organization’s  UTC  mission-specific  weather  operations  and individual  AEF  taskings  (as  applicable).
