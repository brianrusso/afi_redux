The  implementation  of  this  STS  for  technical  training  provided  by AETC  is  with  the  2G031  class  beginning  10  August  2015,    graduating    16  September 2015.  The CDC need date for 5 level is 1 December 2015 and 7 level CDC 15 December 2015. 2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS: 2.1.  Column  1  (Tasks,  Knowledge,  and  Technical  References)  lists  the  most  common tasks,  knowledge,  and  technical  references  (TR)  necessary  for  Airmen  to  perform  duties in the 3, 5, and 7-skill level. 2.2.  Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies the core tasks that must be certified for upgrade to the  next  higher  skill  level.  Supervisors  may  assign  additional  core  tasks,  as  deemed appropriate  that  must  be  certified  for  upgrade  to  the  next  higher  skill  level.  When resources (training expertise, equipment, etc.) are not available to certify an individual on  a core task, the commander will annotate the STS stating that resources are not available. 2.2.1.  During wartime, courses will be taught 10 hours a day, six  days  a week.  Upgrade training will  not  be  denied  to  individuals  who, through  lack  of  resources,  cannot  be  core task  certified.  For  further  information  contact  the  Military  Personnel  Flight  Formal Training Section. 2.3.  Use Column 3  (Certification for OJT) to  record  completion  of tasks and knowledge training requirements. 2.4.  Column 4 (Proficiency Codes Used to Indicate Training/Information Provided) shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on  the task/knowledge  and  the  career  knowledge  provided  by  the  career  development  course. See  CADRE/AFSC/CDC  listing  maintained  by  the  unit-training    manager    for    current CDC listings. 3.  Third  Party  Certification.  Core  tasks  identified  in  this  CFETP  do  not  require  third- party certification. 4.  Recommendations.  Comments  and  recommendations  are  invited  concerning  the quality of  AETC  training.  A  customer  service information  line  (CSIL)  has  been  installed for  the  supervisor’s  convenience  to  identify  graduates  who  may  have  received  over  or under  training  on  task/knowledge  items  listed  in  this   specialty   training   standard.   For quick  responses  to  problems,  call  the  customer  service  information  line,  DSN  473-2917, any  time  day  or  night.  Furthermore,  the  customer  service  line  may  be  reached electronically via email at (37trg.dos@us.af.mil).
