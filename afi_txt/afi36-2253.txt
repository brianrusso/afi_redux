Scope. This instruction provides guidance and policy direction of a continuing nature to create a seam-less environment to meet the Air Force mission for those AETC and AFRC personnel involved in theday-to-day management of the JSUPT, ENJJPT, and IFF Integrated Associate IP Program (hereinaftercalled “the Program”). 2.  Background. This program is designed to be a total force program that fully integrates reserve andactive duty (AD) forces to complete the flying training mission. It reflects Department of Defense (DOD)leadership support of the total force concept. Functions include: 2.1.  Peacetime. The mission of the 340th Flying Training Group (340 FTG) and flying trainingsquadrons (FTS) is to train and provide a reserve of experienced IPs to augment the AETC IP cadre inthe event of wartime mobilization conditions. These units ensure that assigned IPs are trained and pre-pared to accomplish instructor duties by participating in regular flights with both reserve and AD stu-dent and instructor pilots. 2.2.  Wartime and Emergencies. In the event of hostilities, the reserve associate unit is mobilized tooffset the anticipated loss of AD weapon system-qualified pilot pipeline input to AETC pilot instruc-tor training (PIT). 3.  Concept of Operations. The program concept collocates reserve units without unit aircraft or equip-ment with AD AETC units. These units (composed of traditional reservists [TR] and active guard andreserve [AGR] personnel) share aircraft and other facilities of the active unit. 3.1.  Operational Control (OPCON). The host AD operations group commander exercises OPCONof AFRC IPs while performing flights or mission-related support duties. OPCON includes assigningAFRC IPs to operational positions, establishing training and curriculum standards, operating the pilotevaluation systems, as well as all aspects directly related to flight and student training discipline.Refer to AFDD 1, Air Force Basic Doctrine, for a complete description. 3.2.  Administrative Control (ADCON). ADCON remains with the reserve associate unit com-mander. When mobilized, AFRC personnel maintain unit identity and continue to fully integrate withthe AD mission. When activated under less than full mobilization, ADCON remains with the reserveassociate squadron, while OPCON passes to the AD squadron commander. Under full mobilization,reserve associate forces are placed under OPCON and ADCON of the AD Air Force. Reserve associ-ate personnel occupy positions according to their proficiency or capability within functional areas. 3.3.  Authority over Administrative Matters. The AFRC chain of command exercises authorityover reserve associate units in respect to administrative matters such as personnel management (toinclude reserve personnel hiring, ancillary training, and participation scheduling), nonflying train-ing-related discipline, supply, services, pay and finance, and other matters not included in the opera-tional mission of the AD wing. Refer to AFDD 1 for a complete description. 3.4.  Qualification Requirement. The reserve associate pilots will be qualified according to AirForce and AETC standards. 3.5.  Reserve Participation. Reserve personnel participation, including active duty for training(ADT) and inactive duty for training (IDT), is accomplished according to AFMAN 36-8001, ReservePersonnel Participation and Training Procedures. AFI36-2253   1 SEPTEMBER 200553.6.  AGR and TR IP. The AETC and AFRC Associate Instructor Pilot program replaces AD IPswith a combination of AGR and TR IPs. Specifically, for every AD IP returned to a major weaponssystem (MWS), AFRC assigns either one AGR or three TR IPs to support the AD AETC wing. 3.6.1.  TR Participation. The AD has primary OPCON responsibility for scheduling AFRC IPmission-related duties. In order to achieve the goal of the program, offsetting AD IP workload, theTR IP cadre assigned to each AD wing should perform, on average, 72 duty days per year. 3.6.2.  AGR Participation. AFRC AGR IPs have significant responsibilities associated withmanagement and administration of the Associate IP Program and will fly at levels commensuratewith their AD counterparts. 4.  Command Relationships:  4.1.  The AFRC Commander commands all reserve organizations and is responsible for the readinessof the reserve associate units and for ensuring that the training of these units conforms to the estab-lished AETC training standards. AFRC is also responsible for administrative, personnel, logistical,and budgetary support as defined in AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures; AFMD 11, AirForce Reserve (AFRES); and AFI 10-301, Responsibilities of Air Reserve Component (ARC) Forces. 4.2.  Command, nonflying training-related discipline, and ADCON of reserve associate personnel restwith the AFRC command channel. 4.3.  While performing military duties, members of a reserve associate unit are subject to the UniformCode of Military Justice (UCMJ). Jurisdiction for military justice and administrative actions rests, pri-marily, within the reserve chain of command. 5.  Communication Channels:  5.1.  Members of reserve integrated associate units will communicate with their counterpart membersof the host unit. Route correspondence related specifically to reserve integrated associate policy mat-ters through the AFRC chain of command. Units will send copies of correspondence to their AFRCand AETC echelons, as appropriate. 5.2.  AETC Aircrew Training and Standardization Division (HQ AETC/DOF) and AFRC Trainingand Tactics Division (HQ AFRC/DOT) are the offices of primary responsibility (OPR) for all reserveintegrated associate matters.

Section D—Financial Management and Comptroller Functional Responsibilities 16.  Objectives. This section explains comptroller responsibilities of the active force and of the reserveforce as they relate to the reserve associate program. The financial management and comptroller positionfor this program is based on requirements established by Public Law and the directives of the Office of theSecretary of Defense (OSD) and the Air Force for compliance with the law. Objectives in the financialmanagement and comptroller area to delineate funding responsibilities and identify required financialmanagement and comptroller support. 16.1.  Delineation of Funding Responsibility. The reserve associate unit is under the command ofAFRC and is hosted by an AETC base. The parent organization funds those expenses directly relatedto AFRC. Host O&M funds are used to support AFRC tenant units consistent with the funding policycontained in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Chapter 15. Therefore, AETCfinances all expenses that result from support provided by the reserve associate unit. 16.2.  Identification of Required Financial Management and Comptroller Support. For  guid-ance on identifying this support, see paragraphs 17., 18., and 19. 17.  Training. AETC wing financial management and comptrollers will ensure training is provided asrequired by AFI 10-301. 18.  Budget. AETC financial management and comptrollers will ensure that funds are executed forreserve associate unit requirements, as programmed for by HQ AETC/DO. Fund source for expenses aris-ing from the reserve associate unit concept include: 18.1.  Pay of Personnel:  18.1.1.  RPA provides funds for pay, allowances, uniforms, subsistence, etc., of reserve associatemembers.
