Purpose of the CFETP.  This CFETP provides information necessary for Air Force Career Field Managers (AFCFMs), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field  training program.  This plan outlines the training that individuals in AFSC 1P0X1 should receive  to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade,  qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training  an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for  award of the 3-skill level.  Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one or more of the  technical training centers.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification  requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 5-, 7-, and 9-  skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to  qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after  the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required  to do the job.  Advanced training is formal training that provides 6     CFETP 1P0X1, 1 October 2015 individuals who are qualified in  one or more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills/knowledge to  enhance their expertise in the career field.  Supplemental training is either in-residence or  exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training.  The CFETP has several purposes,  some are:  1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career.  1.2.  Identifies tasks and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual's career.  1.3.  Lists training courses that are available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method.  1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints which impact full implementation of the desired career field training process.  2.  Use of the CFETP.  The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.  2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, non-resident, and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the  CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining  resources needed to provide the identified training.  2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements.  OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses can be used to satisfy the identified requirements.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFS must be identified for inclusion into the plan. 2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  3.  Coordination and Approval of the CFETP.  The AFCFM is the approval authority. MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career  field training requirements.  The AETC training manager for 1P0X1 will initiate an annual review  of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy.  Using the list of courses  in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.  SECTION B - Career Progression and Information  4.  Specialty Description.  4.1.

Skill and Career Progression. Timely progression and training from the apprentice  to the superintendent skill level plays an important role in the Air Force's ability to accomplish the mission.  It is essential that everyone involved in training do his or her part to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure individuals receive the necessary training at appropriate points in their career. The following narrative and AFSC 1P0X1 career field table identify the skill/career progression.  5.1.  Apprentice (3) Level. Following Basic Military Training, initial skills training is provided in a 3-level (apprentice) resident course taught at the 82d Training Group, 361st Training Squadron, Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas.  Training provided in this course is determined by the  results from the AFE Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW).  During  the U&TW, subject matter experts use their extensive knowledge and experience and data  provided by the Occupational Analysis Report (OAR) to determine course content.  Task and  knowledge training requirements are identified in Section A of the CFETP (STS).  Upon  completion of this initial-skills course, graduates are awarded the 3-skill level (AFSC 1P031).  The course provides a foundation for additional training at the graduates’ first duty assignment  where trainees work with a trainer to increase knowledge and skills.  Trainees utilize career  development courses (CDC), task qualification training, and other exportable courses to progress  in their career field.  Once trainees have been task certified, they may perform the task  unsupervised.   5.2.  Journeyman (5) Level. Upgrade training to the 5-skill level includes task and knowledge training.  After award of the 3-skill level, trainees are enrolled in the AFE  Journeyman (5-level) CDC.  Additionally, trainees must complete 5-skill level upgrade training  requirements (core tasks & duty position tasks) identified in the STS and attachment 1.  Once upgraded to the 5-skill level, trainees enter into continuation training to broaden their experience base by increasing their knowledge and skills in troubleshooting and solving more complex problems.  Five-levels may be  assigned job positions such as quality control and various section positions.  After having at 9     CFETP 1P0X1, 1 October 2015 least  48 months in the Air Force, 5-levels should attend Airman Leadership School (ALS) to enhance  their Professional Military Education (PME).  Five-levels will be considered for appointment as  unit trainers.  Individuals will use their CDCs to prepare for Weighted Airman Promotion System  (WAPS) testing.  They should also consider continuing their education toward a Community  College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree.  5.3.  Craftsman (7) Level. For award of the 7-skill level, an individual must successfully complete all required 7-level training identified in this CFETP and meet 7-level minimum upgrade  requirements (AFI 36-2201 and Enlisted Classification Directory).  Completion of CDC 1P071 is  part of the required 7-level upgrade training.  A craftsman can expect to fill various supervisory  and management positions such as shift leader, element NCOIC, flight superintendent, and various  staff positions.  Craftsmen should take courses or obtain added knowledge of management of  resources and personnel.  Exportable Mission Design Series (MDS)/Weapon Systems (WS) specific courses and  MAJCOM/unit directed courses are also available.  Continued academic education through CCAF and higher degree programs, especially in resources and personnel management, is encouraged.  In  addition, when promoted to TSgt, individuals will attend the Noncommissioned Officer Academy  (NCOA).  TSgt’s should enroll in the Senior NCO Academy (SNCOA) correspondence course to  further their professional development.  MSgt's will also attend SNCOA, in-residence, prior to  promotion to the rank of SMSgt. 5.4.  Superintendent (9) Level. For award of the 9-skill level, individuals must hold the rank of SMSgt.  A 9-level can expect to fill positions such as flight chief, superintendent, and various staff  NCOIC jobs.  Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower, resources, and personnel  management should be pursued through continuing education.  In-residence or correspondence attendance at the  SNCOA prior to promotion to the rank of SMSgt is mandatory.  Additional higher education and completion of courses outside their career  AFS is also recommended.  6.  Training Decisions.  The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the AFE career  field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet these training  requirements.  The strategy must ensure we develop affordable training, eliminate duplication, and  prevent a fragmented approach to training.  The following training decisions were based on career  field utilization and training workshop (U&TW) held at Sheppard Air Force Base, TX, from 9-13  March 2015.  6.1.  Initial Skills. The apprentice course is 56 days in length.  The course will encompass the Air Force technical order system, material/condition tags, ALSET, SCOT Release Tester, G-Force fundamentals, ACBRN protection fundamentals, CSEL AN/PRQ-7 Series Radios, Parachute/Torso harness removal and installation, SCOT release inspect, removal, and installation, URT-44’s, ML-4 fundamentals of inspection and packing and survival components fundamentals.  Additional topics addressed include protective equipment, emergency electronic communication equipment, night vision imaging systems, fabric items, sewing, life preservers, life rafts, survival kits, back automatic parachute, and the ACES II recovery parachute.  6.2.  Five Level Upgrade Requirements. Upgrade to the 5-level requires completion of the 1P051 CDCs,  completion of all core tasks and duty position tasks (see attachment 1) on one MDS aircraft/WS, and a minimum of 12 months upgrade training.  The number of  core tasks will be determined by the aircraft type being supported (see attachment 1).  Each  technician will be qualified from "tip to tail" on one weapons system before the award of the 5-level. 10    CFETP 1P0X1, 1 October 2015  6.3.  Seven Level Upgrade Requirements. Upgrade to the 7-level requires completion of the 1P071 CDCs,  completion of all core tasks and duty position tasks (see attachment 1) on one MDS aircraft/WS, and  12 months upgrade training.  6.4.  Supplemental Courses. The U.S. Army will continue to provide MC-6, RA-1, Ram-Air, and Static Line Parachute training.  It was  decided to continue the in-resident Ram Air and Static Line Parachute Systems courses until the  MTT versions are finalized.  6.5.  Continuation Training. None  7.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). CCAF is one of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions; however, it is the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military enlisted personnel.  The college is regionally accredited through Air University by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award AAS degrees designed for specific Air Force occupational specialties and is the largest multi-campus community college in the world.  Upon completion of basic military training and assignment to an AF career field, all enlisted personnel are registered in a CCAF degree program and are afforded the opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Science degree. In order to be awarded, degree requirements must be successfully completed before the student separates from the Air Force, retires, or is commissioned as an officer.  See the CCAF website for details regarding the AAS degree programs at http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/.  7.1.  CCAF Degree Requirements.

Measurement. Each proficiency coded STS task or knowledge item taught at the technical school is measured through the use of an objective.  An objective is a written instruction for the student so he or she knows what is expected of them to successfully complete training on each task.  Each objective is comprised of a condition, behavior, and standard that states what is expected of the student for each task.  The condition is the setting in which the training takes place.  The behavior is the action a student must demonstrate to accomplish a task (i.e. Inspect and  repack a parachute assembly).  The standard is the level of performance that is measured to ensure  the STS proficiency level is attained.  Each objective uses letter code(s) to identify how it is  measured.  All objectives use the Progress Check (PC) code that indicates a progress check is used  to measure subject or task knowledge.  Progress checks are also used to measure student accomplishment of performance objectives.  “W” indicates a comprehensive written test and is used to measure the subject and/or task knowledge at the end of a block of instruction.  PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress check.  5.  Standard.  The minimum standard is 70% on written examinations.  Standards for performance measurement are identified in the objective and delineated on the individual progress  checklist.  The instructor will document each student’s progress on each task using the  checklist.    Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be  required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. Students  must satisfactorily complete all PCs prior to taking the written test.  6.  Proficiency Level.  Review column 4A of the STS to determine the proficiency level of a particular task or knowledge item.  Review the proficiency code key in Part II, Section E of this CFETP for an explanation of the proficiency codes.  Review the course objective list to determine  which STS item the objective supports.  Most task performance is taught to the "2b" proficiency  level.  The "2b" means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the  hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step-by-step  procedures for doing the task.  The student should be able to identify why and when the task must  be done and why each step is needed.  7.
