Conversion charts for energy units may be found at: http://www.think-energy.net/energy_units.htm. 8 AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 Chapter 4 TYPES OF UTILITY CONTRACTS 4.1.  Support  Agreements.  Support agreements are used when acquiring utilities from another Federal agency.  4.1.1.  When  acquiring  utilities  from  another  AF  organization  or  DoD  agency,  a  written support agreement is used to record the type and conditions of service (Ref:  DoDI 4000.19, Support Agreements). 4.1.2.  When  acquiring  utilities  from  another  Federal  agency,  a  written  interagency  support agreement  is  used  to  record  the  type  and  conditions  of  service  (Ref:    FAR  Part  17.5, Interagency Acquisitions Under the Economy Act). 4.2.  Indefinite Term Contracts.  An indefinite term contract means a month-to-month contract for  utility  services  that  may  be  terminated  by  the  Government  upon  proper  notice.    The  notice period for termination may be anytime between 30 days and 1 year.  (Note:  This provision is not in conflict with the time limitations of FAR 41.103.) 4.2.1.  IAW  Defense  FAR  Supplement  (DFARS)  Part  24.205,  an  indefinite  term  contract shall be used when it is considered in the Government’s best interest. 4.2.2.  If a base  contracting office is  considering  terminating  an indefinite term  contract  for utility  service,  the  base  legal  office,  AFCEC/CN,  and  Air  Force  Legal  Operating  Agency, Environmental  Law  and  Litigation  Division  –  Utility  Law  Field  Support  Center (AFLOA/JACE – ULFSC) must be notified as soon  as possible and provided the indefinite term contract for review and comment. 4.3.  Direct  Supply  Natural  Gas  Program  (DSNGP).  The  DoD  policy  is  to  competitively acquire natural  gas via the DSNGP.  DSNGP is  managed by Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Energy.  DLA Energy awards a contract to a natural gas supplier and an installation may request to  be  a part of that  contract  via task order.   DLA arranges for transportation of the natural  gas commodity  via  interstate  pipelines  to  local  distribution  companies.    The  base  arranges  for transportation  of  the  commodity  from  the  interstate  or  intrastate  pipeline  through  the  local distribution company (LDC) system to the base distribution system as required.  DLA evaluates the installation’s requirements. 4.4.  Separate  Utility  Service  Contracts  (See  FAR,  Parts  41.  103(a)(2)  and    41.305,  and DFARS  Part  241,  Acquisition  of  Utility  Services).    A  separate  utility  service  contract  is  used when  the  GSA  area-wide  contract  is  not  available  or  separate  contract  is  found  to  be  more advantageous to the government.  With these contracts it is advisable to: 4.4.1.  Ensure  utility  service  contracts,  agreements,  and  modifications  are  acceptable  before sending to the base contracting officer for execution.  4.4.2.  Negotiate  the  lowest  overall  cost  commensurate  with  the  installation’s  mission requirements. 4.4.3.  Negotiate and add special provisions. 4.4.4.  Add the installation’s utility service specifications. AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 9 4.4.5.  Ensure the negotiated payment date is no earlier than 30 days from the date of billing. If the payment date must be earlier than 30 days from the date of billing, work with the utility provider  on  alternative  charges  in  lieu  of  the  earlier  payment  date.  The  AF  and  Defense Finance and Accounting Services validation and routing processes make it difficult to meet a payment date earlier than 30 days, thus making AF susceptible to late fees. 4.4.6.  Pay the bills in a timely manner avoiding late fees. 10 AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 Chapter 5 ACQUIRING ELECTRIC SERVICE 5.1.  Electric Service Considerations.  Consider using the following options, presented in order of preference, when determining best value for acquiring new electric service for the main base. 5.1.1.  Supplier's  (public  or  municipal  utility)  transmission  voltage  to  supplier-owned substation, with distribution through a supplier- or privately owned distribution system. 5.1.2.  Supplier's  transmission  voltage  to  a  government-owned  substation,  with  the  delivery point on the supplier’s side of the substation transformer to a government-owned distribution system. 5.1.3.  Supplier’s transmission voltage to a supplier-owned substation (with a separate charge to the government for use of the facilities), with the delivery point on the government side of the substation transformer to a government-owned distribution system. 5.1.4.  Supplier’s  transmission  voltage  directly  to  a  government-owned  distribution  system when government system primary voltage is the same as the supplier’s transmission voltage. 5.1.5.  Supplier’s secondary voltage directly to a building load for small, localized loads. 5.1.6.  Government-owned central plant to a government-owned substation with distribution through a government-owned distribution system. AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 11 Chapter 6 ACQUIRING NATURAL GAS SERVICE 6.1.  Natural  Gas  Service  Considerations.  Consider  using  natural  gas  when  it  is  the  most economical  fuel  available.    DLA  Energy  awards  contracts  for  directly  purchasing  natural  gas from  producers,  thus  the  Air  Force  would  be  purchasing  the  commodity  directly  from  the producer.  The organization also arranges transportation of the natural gas via interstate pipelines to  LDC and bases manage the transportation of the commodity through the LDC system to the base  distribution  system.    Transportation  may  be  acquired  under  a  separate  contract.    The following  options,  in  preferred  order,  help  determine  the  best  method  for  acquiring  natural  gas service: 6.1.1.  Local  utility  supplier’s  (public  or  municipal  utility)  natural  gas  distributed  using  on-base distribution through a supplier or privately owned system. 6.1.2.  Local  utility  supplier’s  (public  or  municipal  utility)  natural  gas  distributed  using  on-base distribution through a government-owned system. 6.1.3.  Competitively  procured  natural  gas  using  on-base  distribution  through  a  supplier  or privately owned system. 6.1.4.  Competitively procured natural gas using on-base distribution through a government-owned system. 12 AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 Chapter 7 ACQUIRING WATER AND SEWAGE SERVICE 7.1.  Water  and  Sewage  Service  Considerations.  Consider  the  following  options  when determining best value for acquiring water and sewage service: 7.1.1.  For water for the main base, in order of preference: 7.1.1.1.  Supplier’s (public or municipal utility) water with distribution through a supplier or privately owned distribution system. 7.1.1.2.  Supplier’s  water  with  distribution  through  a  government-owned  distribution system. 7.1.1.3.  Government-owned  water  supply  facilities distribution system. through  a  government-owned 7.1.2.  For sewage service for the main base, in order of preference: 7.1.2.1.  Supplier’s (public municipal utility) treatment facilities with collection through a supplier- or privately owned collection system. 7.1.2.2.  Supplier’s  treatment  facilities  with  collection  through  a  government-owned collection system. 7.1.2.3.  Government-owned treatment  facilities through a  government-owned collection system. AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 13 Chapter 8 CONNECTION AND TERMINATION CHARGES OR LIABILITY 8.1.  Acquiring  Utility  Service.  Consider  acquiring  utility  service  without  a  FAR  Part  41 termination  liability  or  connection  charge.    When  a  utility  supplier  builds  electric  generating capacity or transmission lines specifically for the installation, the termination liability amount or the  connection  charge  can  be  substantial.    If  possible,  negotiate  a  termination  liability  charge before offering a connection charge. 8.2.  Funds  for  Termination  Charges.  Funds  for  termination  charges  are  typically  obligated when  the  actual  termination  of  the  contract  occurs  (Ref:  Title  31  United  States  Code  (USC) §1501,  Appropriation  Accounting  (Documentary  Evidence  Requirement  for  Government Obligations); and DoD 7000.14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 3, Budget Execution - Availability and Use of Budgetary Resources).  8.2.1.  When using a definite-term utility service contract or any utility service contract with a termination liability, the minimum charge provision (i.e., “the minimum monthly charge”) means  any  minimum  charges  of  the  supplier’s  rate  schedule  that  become  payable  if  the government reduces its usage below the minimum or terminates the service.  8.2.2.  Consider negotiating a refundable connection charge, if possible.  8.3.  Connection  Charge  or  Termination  Liability.  It  is  not  advisable  to  base  a  connection charge  or  termination  liability  on  the  utility  supplier's  entire  construction  cost.  The  connection charge  is  never  more  than  the  installation  cost  less  net  salvage  value.    Labor  only  installation costs  do  not  have  a  salvage  value.  The  supplier  recovers  some  of  the  construction  costs  in  the rate schedules. In arriving at fair and reasonable construction costs, consider the following:  8.3.1.  Permanency of load, annual load factor, and potential growth. 8.3.2.  Proposed construction cost applicable to AF and to other customers. 8.3.3.  Utility supplier's line extension policy  and the amount of  expansion cost  included in rate schedules. 8.3.4.  Special  considerations  that  the  utility  supplier  accords  to  other  large  industrial customers. 8.3.5.  Added  tax  cost  to  the  utility  supplier  if  there  is  a  contribution  in  aid  of  construction tax.  14 AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 Chapter 9 RATE SCHEDULES 9.1.  Utility Supplier Rate Schedules.  Some utility suppliers offer several rate schedules for the same conditions of service.  Consider reviewing the utility supplier’s rate schedules to determine which rate schedule applies to the base and results in the lowest cost to the government.  Some utility  suppliers  offer  a  choice  of  energy  and  demand  charges  to  large  customers.    One  rate schedule includes high-energy charges with low-demand charges and another rate schedule may include low-energy charges with high-demand charges.  If possible, use the previous 12 months of (historical) billing data to determine which rate schedule offers the lowest cost. 9.2.  Time-of-Day  Rates.  Some  utility  suppliers  require  large  consumers  to  take  service  on  a time-of-day rate, and some offer it as an alternative to other rates. 9.2.1.  Time-of-day rate schedules specify on-peak, off-peak, and a partial (or shoulder) peak period.    The  rates  for  energy  and  demand  used  during  the  peak  period  are  higher  than  the rates for energy and demand during the off-peak period.  The start, end, and duration of the peak period differ greatly among suppliers.  When the installation shifts usage from the on-peak period to the off-peak period, utility bills can be reduced using time-of-day rates. 9.2.2.  Potential  savings  under  a  time-of-day  rate  schedule  are  calculated  using  12-month historical and 12-month projected billings for the installation. 9.3.  Interruptible  Rates.  Some  utility  suppliers  offer  interruptible  service  at  a  substantial savings over firm (non-interruptible) service.  Interruptible service permits the utility supplier to temporarily  discontinue  service  during  peak  demand  hours.    The  utility  supplier  will  give advance notice, ranging from a few minutes to several hours.  The cost savings is proportional to the amount of advance notice the Air Force receives before the utility interruption. 9.4.  Demand  Ratchets.  Some  rate  schedules  contain  a  demand  ratchet  provision,  which  is  a means  of  applying  a  minimum  billing  to  a  customer  who  may  have  inconsistent  or  seasonal energy requirements.  The utility supplier incurs costs by making the utility available to the AF when it needs it. 9.4.1.  If the existing rate schedule contains a demand ratchet and the base Energy Manager expects  1  month  of  abnormally  high  demand  (caused  by  a  construction  project,  equipment testing, or other factors), consider asking the contracting officer to negotiate with the utility supplier  to  avoid  unnecessary  demand  charges  for  the  next  12  months.    The  factor  causing unusual  demand  can  be  estimated  in  advance  for  successful  negotiations  with  the  utility supplier. 9.4.2.  If  the  existing  rate  schedule  contains  a  demand  ratchet  and  the  BCE  expects  the installation's  load  to  decline  (caused  by  demolition  of  buildings,  installation  of  renewable energy source, or other factors), consider asking the contracting officer to negotiate with the utility supplier to delete the demand ratchet from the rate schedule. 9.5.  Standby  Rates.  Standby  rates  require  the  utility  supplier  to  stand  ready  to  serve  the government’s load when the Air Force’s utility production facilities do not operate.  The utility supplier provides a connection for use by the Air Force, and this connection is used when the Air Force is unable to produce enough energy from their own resources.   AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 15 9.6.  Franchise Fee.  Most utility suppliers obtain franchises from incorporated cities and towns within their service territory and may pay a fee based on the dollar amount of the utility bill for the  use  of  the  municipality's  alleys,  streets,  and  rights-of-way  where  distribution  lines  are located.    Sometimes  the  supplier  lists  the  franchise  fee  separately  on  the  bill.    Franchise  fee issues  are  highly  dependent  on  local  and  state  tax  law.  It  is  advisable  to  refer  questions  on whether  an  installation  should  pay  such  amounts  to  the  installation  legal  office  or  the AFLOA/JACE-ULFSC. 16 AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 Chapter 10 RATE CHANGES 10.1.  Requests  for  Rate  Changes.  Requests  for  rate  changes  are  processed  differently  for utility  suppliers  not  subject  to  an  independent  regulatory  body  than  for  suppliers  subject  to  an independent regulatory body. 10.2.  Power  Marketing  Administrations.  Power  Marketing  Administrations  request  rate changes  through  a  public  participation  process.    They  publish  proposed  rate  changes  in  the Federal Register for public comments, and then hold public meetings to receive and discuss all oral and written comments.  After considering all comments, they decide, approve, and publish the new rate. 10.3.  Utility  Suppliers  Not  Subject  to  a  Regulatory  Body  (Non-regulated  Utility).  FAR 52.241-8  clause,  "Change  in  Rates  or  Terms  and  Conditions  of  Service  for  Unregulated Suppliers," is typically used in utility service contracts.  This clause allows either party to request a change in rates or terms and conditions of service, with both parties agreeing to enter into good faith negotiations concerning such changes.  When the utility service contract  provides for rate negotiation, the installation: 10.3.1.  Provides notification of a rate increase as follows: 10.3.1.1.  Installations located outside the continental United States request AFCEC/CNR assistance, if needed. 10.3.1.2.  Installations  in  the  continental  United  States  inform  AFCEC/CNR  within  24 hours if the potential increase to an installation is: 10.3.1.2.1.  Unreasonable, unjustified, or discriminatory 10.3.1.2.2.  Four percent (4%) or above in any one year 10.3.1.2.3.  An aggregate of 4% or above over the course of 5 years 10.3.2.  Does not recognize rate changes for any amount until the parties agree to a mutually satisfactory  rate  and  a  date  for  the  new  rate  to  take  effect,  and  then  modifies  the  utility service contract to add the new rate. 10.3.3.  Makes payment at the old rate until the contracting officer modifies the utility service contract  to  add  the  new  rate  during  this  period,  ensures  the  financial  manager  commits enough  funds  to  cover  the  possibility  of  retroactive  payment  based  on  the  utility  supplier’s initially proposed rate increase (Ref:  DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 3). 10.4.  Utility  Suppliers  Subject  to  an  Independent  Regulatory  Body  (i.  e.,  Regulated Utility).    FAR  52.241-7  clause,  "Change  in  Rates  or  Terms  and  Conditions  of  Service  for Regulated Suppliers," is typically used in utility service contracts.  This clause requires the Air Force to pay for utility service at the regulated rate.  Prompt processing of a regulated supplier's request for change in rates is advised. 10.4.1.  The BCE should give all known details to the base legal office, base contracting, and AFCEC/CNR within 24 hours of change notification. 10.4.2.  AFCEC/CNR then notifies the AFLOA/JACE-ULFSC. AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 17 10.4.3.  The base legal office informs the AFLOA/JACE-ULFSC of any potential or pending hearings involving base utilities at a public utility commission hearings or state proceedings. 10.4.4.  The  base  legal  office  informs  the  AFLOA/JACE-ULFSC  of  the  request  for intervention. 10.4.5.  Within 1 week of the date that the installation informs  AFCEC/CNR of a proposed rate increase, the BCE should provide AFCEC/CNR the following (with information copies to base legal and base contracting): 10.4.5.1.  A list of all DoD activities being serviced by the utility company. 10.4.5.2.  The date the supplier filed the request for a change in rates with the regulatory body,  the  assigned  docket  number,  the  amount  and  the  percent  requested  for  total company  revenue,  and  the  amount  and  the  percent  of  potential  annual  impact  on  the installation. 10.4.5.3.  A  copy  of  the  supplier's  request  for  a  change  in  rates  (obtain  from  either  the supplier or the regulatory body). 10.4.5.4.  The  date,  amount,  and  percent  in  total  revenue  of  the  supplier's  last  approved rate increase. 10.4.5.5.  A  copy  of  the  previous  12  months  of  utility  bills  (electric,  gas,  or  water)  to AFLOA/JACE-ULFSC in order for them to determine the impact of the proposed utility rate increase and whether or not intervention is warranted. 10.4.5.6.  A  copy  of  other  rate  schedules  applicable  to  the  installation  that  is  more economical  than the proposed rate schedule, along with  a month-by-month  comparison.  If no other rate schedule is more economical, make a statement to that effect. 10.4.5.7.  A list of other Federal  agencies and large industrial or commercial consumers receiving service under the same or similar rate schedules. 10.4.6.  AFLOA/JACE-ULFSC  then  informs  AFCEC/CNR  of  its  recommendations  for AFCEC/CNR to intervene.  AFCEC/CNR provides Temporary Duty funding for utility rate intervention support and technical expertise. 10.4.7.  If  the  decision  is  made  to  intervene,  the  Federal  executive  agency  constituting  the largest  energy  user  affected  by  the  requested  rate  change  typically  takes  the  lead  on  any intervention.  Where the AF is the largest energy user, AFLOA/ JACE-ULFSC intervenes on behalf of all Federal executive agencies.  The AFLOA/JACL-ULFSC attorney is the Federal executive agency’s sole representative and will handle all matters before the state regulatory body. 10.4.8.  When  the  independent  regulatory  body  approves  and  puts  a  new  rate  into  effect, notify the financial manager of the financial impact and effective date of the new rate. 18 AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 Chapter 11 UTILITY BILLS AND PAYMENT 11.1.  Utility  Bill  Payment  Process.  The  Financial  Management  section  of  the  Installations Management Flight coordinates to ensure utility bills are validated and processed for payment to avoid  late  fees  (see  Figure  11.1,  Model  Utility  Bill  Payment  Process).    Faster  processing  is possible using  electronic mediums for billing and payment.   If  a utility  provider does not  have automatic electronic billing services, the provider can be asked to fax or e-mail a scanned copy of the bill before mailing it. Figure 11.1.  Model Utility Bill Payment Process.  AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 19 Chapter 12 UTILITY PURCHASE CONTRACT REVIEW 12.1.  Utility  Contracts.  Reviewing  utility  contracts  annually  and  when  a  contract  is  modified ensures  the  Air  Force  is  acquiring  utilities  at  the  most  favorable  rate  available  and  costs  are minimized. The AF Form 3550,  Annual Utility Contract Review for Electric Service; AF Form 3551,  Annual  Utility  Contract  Review  for  Gas  Service;  and  AF  Form  3552,  Annual  Utility Contract Review for Water and Sewage Service, are used to document this review. 12.1.1.  An analysis of unusual or unexpected change can be done by comparing current cost trends to historical data. 12.1.2.  Determining  whether  current  utility  service  requirements,  including  quality  and quantity  of  service,  are  within  the  estimated  demand,  consumption,  and  other  contract provisions is also useful.  However, reducing estimated maximum demand and consumption in existing contracts to coincide with current actual reduced demand and consumption is not recommended unless such reduction results in a benefit to the government.  Such reductions result in the loss of demand or consumption rights in connecting facilities. 12.1.3.  Reviewing  the  utility  supplier's  applicable  rates  for  the  installation's  actual  usage, conditions, and characteristics of service will help ensure the installation buys utilities at the most advantageous rate schedule. 12.1.4.  Reviewing metering and billing procedures will help ensure those procedures are the most  advantageous  to  the  government.    This  can  be  done  by  reviewing  utility  contracts annually and when a contract is modified to ensure the Air Force is acquiring utilities at the most favorable rate available and costs to  the Air Force are minimized.  Metering provides data that allows scrutiny and correlation to the monthly invoice from the supplier. 12.1.5.  Maintaining  review  documentation  and  making  corrective  actions  for  each discrepancy in the utility service folder will improve procedures. 12.1.6.  Providing the base contracting officer a copy of the updated information and a letter with  recommended  utility  contract  changes  is  advisable.    When  the  review  shows  actual consumption  or  demand  exceeds  contract  quantities,  a  new  service  specification  (see Attachments 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) should be prepared and added to the contract. 20 AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 Chapter 13 MANAGING UTILITIES 13.1.  Producing  and  Managing  Utilities.  The  Operations  Support  element  of  the  Operations Flight  provides a monthly  and annual  work order report showing all work completed on utility systems.  This could include a variety of account codes depending on the Operations Flight and Financial  Management  section  of  the  Installations  Management  Flight.    The  Operations  Flight ensures the work associated with the utility systems is properly and accurately documented into the  appropriate  information  management  system  database  and  that  labor,  materials,  equipment, vehicles, and supplies are included in work accountability.   13.1.1.  Work associated with utility systems includes (but not limited to) work on piping, lift stations,  transformers,  valves,  lines,  conduit,  overhead  electrical  poles,  electrical  vaults, water  wells,  water  hydrants,  sewer  manholes,  primary  power  electrical  generators,  waste water treatment and collection plants, etc.  Work on utility systems normally begins five feet away from the exterior wall of a building.  Work performed on and in buildings or facilities is not normally a utility cost unless the building is for the exclusive production or distribution of a utility.  Street lighting and traffic controls are not considered utility costs so work order information should not include costs for work on these systems. 13.1.2.  Sample civil  engineer utility  account  codes and real  property  category  codes useful in analyzing utility costs are in Attachment 2. 13.1.3.  A work report includes all costs associated with operations, repair, and maintenance.  These costs include: 13.1.3.1.  Military labor. 13.1.3.2.  Civilian labor. 13.1.3.3.  Materials. 13.1.3.4.  Chemicals. 13.1.3.5.  Equipment. 13.1.3.6.  Government owned laboratory. 13.1.3.7.  Sludge disposal. 13.1.3.8.  Permit fees. 13.1.3.9.  Service maintenance contract costs. AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 21 Chapter 14 PROVIDING UTILITY COMMODITIES 14.1.  Utility  Sales  Rates  Computation.  AF  Form  3556,  Utility  Sales  Rates  Computation Worksheet,  is  used  to  compute  utility  rates.    The  AF  Form  3556  also  allows  monitoring  of  the impact  of  utility  provider  rate  changes,  which  is  useful  as  rate  increases/decreases  from  utility companies of more than 5 percent are passed along to the base customer as they occur.  Until this form is updated on the Air Force e-Publishing website, AFCEC should be contacted directly for the current version and for instructions on its use. 14.2.  Annual Rate Updates.  Annual mandatory rate updates are documented with the AF Form 3555, Utility Sales Rates, which offers a comparison of the previous 12 months of actual costs to computed sale rates. Annual updates are effective 1 January of each year. 14.2.1.  A copy of the updated AF Form 3555 is provided to the finance office to ensure the form shows the date of rate change and the first billing month of the new rate, and to notify the customer with a memo in their monthly utility bill if utility rates change during the year before 1 January.  14.3.  Computing Utility Reimbursement Rates.  The most efficient method to calculate utility rates is to use the AF Form 3556.  The information below is intended to be used with the form.  Utility reimbursement rates are calculated by adding the cost factors in Figure 14.1, Utility Rate Factors, and explained in the following paragraphs: 22 AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 Figure 14.1.  Utility Rate Factors.  C = Charge N = Not charged P = Charge only if service is provided through (passes through) the main base distribution or collection system. SB = Sole Benefit Test.  Charge operations, maintenance, and repair for the portion of the system infrastructure owned by the Government and provided solely for the benefit of the customer.  See paragraphs 14.3.6.5 and 14.3.6.6 of this AFPAM, and AFI 32-1061 for further clarification with respect to Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) projects.  (1) If Housing Privatization (HP) contractor purchases the utility commodity directly from the utility company, the base is not the utility provider and no utility sales agreement with the government or reimbursable charges are necessary.  Wheeling charges may apply (See paragraph 14.3.12) (2) Charge the local prevailing rate for similar customer category rate class if higher than the calculated non-Federal rate. (3) HP contractor pays directly for Operations &Maintenance (O&M)and recapitalization of utility systems provided for the sole benefit of HP.  (4) Do not charge for Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) or Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESCs).  All actions affecting funding are coordinated with the NAF funds manager.   AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 23 14.3.1.  Capitalized Investment Cost of Facilities.  Capitalized costs are directly related to the maximum capacity of the utility system.  The total capital investment of the system is found in Real Property Inventories (RPI).  The real property manager provides this information to the  Energy  Manager.    Additional  information  on  RPI  is  available  in  AFI  32-9005,  Real Property Accountability and Reporting. 14.3.2.  Total  Annual  Maximum  Capacity  of  Utility  System.    The  total  annual  maximum capacity is the maximum amount of the utility that a system can carry at a particular moment (in  kilowatts,  gallons,  or  MBTUs)  multiplied  by  the  total  units  of  time  in  a  year  (525,600 minutes  or  8,760  hours).    Generating  capacity  denotes  the  maximum  amount  of  power  or commodity that can be produced by a given facility.  Load capacity or transmission capacity denotes  the  maximum  amount  of  energy  that  can  be  transmitted  through  a  system  or maximum amount of capacity that a utility provider will deliver.  Flow capacity is measured in tons, cubic feet or cubic meters, and indicates the maximum amount of gas or liquid that can be transported through a pipeline.  Capacity  can vary depending on the current  state of the system or its capabilities at  a given moment,  so it is  not a fixed or absolute value.  For example, a generator's capacity may increase or decrease depending on the type or mixture of fuel used, and a gas pipeline's capacity will vary with changes in the ambient air temperature.  14.3.3.  Basic  Cost.    The  basic  cost  is  the  total  annual  cost  of  a  utility  purchased  and produced  divided  by  the  annual  total  consumption.    The  basic  cost  includes  ESPC,  UESC, and UP costs as shown in Figure 14.1. 14.3.3.1.  When purchasing utility service, the total  annual  purchased cost is  divided by the annual consumption.   14.3.3.2.  If  an  AF-owned  plant  generates the  cost  of production/generation  is  divided  by  the  total  consumption  (or  estimated  consumption  if consumption not metered). the  utility  commodity, 14.3.3.3.  When  using  a  combination  of  AF  produced  and  purchased  services,  both  the purchases and the produced costs are totaled before dividing by the total consumption. 14.3.3.4.  Utilities  Privatization  (UP)  Charges.    When  utility  systems  on  the  installation are owned by a UP System Owner, the AF pays for the UP owner to operate and maintain these systems in one of two ways: 14.3.3.4.1.  Incremental  UP  Charges.    If  the  base  utility  system  has  been  privatized and there are incremental UP charges, the UP cost is calculated by dividing the total annual UP charges by the annual utility system consumption. 14.3.3.4.2.  Bundled  Commodity  UP  Charges.    If  all  delivery  charges  (including charges  for  on-base  distribution)  are  bundled  with  the  commodity  charges,  no calculation is necessary; there is no incremental UP charge. 14.3.3.5.  ESPC or UESC is used for energy conservation measures.  The UESC charges may be included in the monthly utility purchased utility bill as a bundled cost to the AF.  ESPC and UESC costs should not added twice to the AF Form 3556 if they are billed as a bundled  charge.    Until  this  form  is  updated  on  the  Air  Force  e-Publishing  website, AFCEC can be contacted directly for the current version.  24 AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 14.3.3.6.  For  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  (MWR)  Category  C  activities, reimbursement is not authorized for ESPC/UESC costs associated with utility systems or basic facility components.  MWR Category C functionally-unique facility elements may be  included  in  ESPC/UESC  projects,  in  which  case  nonappropriated  fund  (NAF) reimbursements would be authorized only for that portion of work done.  It is advisable to coordinate all actions affecting funding with the NAF funds manager. 14.3.4.  Connection  Fee  Charges.    Connection  fees  are  billed  with  the  monthly  purchased utility  bill.    The  MWR  and  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES)  reimbursable rate is reduced by any connection fees paid by the AF, therefore, subtracting the connection fees  from  the  MWR  and  AAFES  utility  reimbursement  rate  is  appropriate  as  shown  in Figure 14.1. 14.3.5.  Distribution  Line  Losses  or  Gains.    The  energy  loss  in  the  AF  transmission  and distribution  system  (or  gains  in  the  AF  collection  system)  refers  to  the  difference  in  the amount  of  energy  delivered  to  a  distribution  system  and  amount  of  energy  delivered  to  the customer.    Line  loss  may  be  estimated  or  calculated  by  a  qualified  engineer.    The  AF normally uses an estimated 10 percent energy loss if the amount of loss is unknown. 14.3.5.1.  When estimating wastewater services, if the user's flow is metered or estimated from  its  facilities,  the  commodity  cost  is  usually  increased  by  10  percent  or  the  actual infiltration can be determined and used to increase the commodity cost. 14.3.5.2.  When estimating industrial wastewater, if the user's flow is estimated from the metered  flow  through  the  industrial  wastewater  treatment  plant,  the  meter  readings already include line inflow or infiltration. 14.3.6.  System  O&M  Costs.    AF  transmission,  distribution,  and  collection  system  annual O&M costs per unit of service is determined from work order and project information.  When AF owns, operates, and maintains a utility distribution system, the base pays these expenses with  BCE  appropriated  funds.    O&M  costs  are  tracked  by  the  Operations  Flight  and Engineering  Flight  depending  on  who  performs  the  work  and  how  the  work  is  performed (contract or in-house).  Customers receiving utilities from the AF share the burden of these costs depending on the customer’s classification as shown in Figure 14.1. 14.3.6.1.  System  O&M  costs  include  all  routine  maintenance  and  repair.    If  the  repair does not add value or capacity, does not change the type of system (such as removing an overhead utility line and replacing it with  an underground line), or upgrades the system (such  as  replacing  an  old  distribution  system  with  the  same  size  but  new  system), consider  the  repair  to  be  routine  maintenance  and  repair,  and  included  in  system  O&M cost. 14.3.6.2.  Work  on  the  system  is  performed  by  work  order,  service  contract,  and construction  contract.    Expenses  in  this  work  include  labor,  equipment,  materials, chemicals, supplies, tools, and vehicles.  Data applicable to all possible sources of work on the system should be collected and all items of expenses included. 14.3.6.3.  Projects are normally programmed a year or more in advance of execution and the Energy Manager should let customers know of future rate increases.  Customers can plan  for  the  increased  expenses  by  budgeting  for  the  increased  costs.    This  can  be accomplished by preparing AF Form 3556 with the proposed large project costs included AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 25 and notifying the customer of the estimated future costs of their utilities.  Until this form is  updated  on  the  Air  Force  e-Publishing  website,  AFCEC  should  be  contacted  directly for the current version. 14.3.6.4.  The real property capitalized costs definition is used to determine work that is considered  O&M  and  work  that  is  considered  a  capitalized  investment.    Military Construction  and  Restoration  &  Modernization  are  usually  considered  capital investments, while sustainment projects are normally O&M costs.  Exceptions may exist, so coordinating with the Financial Management section of the Installations Management Flight  is  advisable  to  determine  what  costs  apply  to  the  O&M  category  and  what  costs apply to capitalization charges. 14.3.6.5.  A  “sole  benefit  test”  helps  determine  what  portion  of  the  system  and  its associate charges apply to DoD, Military Family Housing, MHPI and Federal customers, as shown in Figure 14.1.  These customers are charged O&M costs for the portion of the system provided solely for their benefit (DoDI 4000.19). 14.3.6.6.  For  MHPI  projects,  when  the  AF  retains  ownership  of  the  utility  systems  and there are AF facilities located anywhere within the boundaries of the entire MHPI leased premises, or AF facilities located outside of the MHPI leased premises receiving or able to  receive  service  from  a  utility  distribution  system  located  anywhere  within  the  MHPI leased premises, then the entirety of that utility distribution system does not solely benefit the MHPI project.  In such cases, the MHPI project at that installation is entirely exempt from paying reimbursements for any O&M and capitalized investment on any portion of that utility distribution system.   14.3.7.  Other  Utility  Costs.    These  include  the  cost  of  ancillary  utility  service  required  to provide the utility service, such as heat for a water treatment plant, the cost of electric power used to pump water, the cost of chilled water or potable water to pump and treat wastewater, and the cost of electricity to operate lift stations and wastewater treatment plants.  The “Other Utilities”  section  of  AF  Form  3556  is  used  to  compute  other  utility  costs  associated  with producing  and  distributing  a  utility  service,  as  shown  in  Figure  14.1.    Until  this  form  is updated  on  the  Air  Force  e-Publishing  website,  AFCEC  can  be  contacted  directly  for  the current version. 14.3.8.  Military  Labor  Costs.  Military  labor  costs  are  included  as  a  separate  item  in appropriate  information  management  reports  from  the  Operations  Flight.    Military  labor  is deducted  from  rates  for  DoD  Federal  agencies  as  shown  in  Figure  14.1.    Civilian  and contract labor costs are included in reimbursable rates to all customers, thus a higher resale rate  results  when  using  civilian  or  contract  labor  for  work  performed  on  on-base  utility systems. 14.3.9.  Capitalized  Investment  Charges.    The  capitalized  investment  charges  are  passed  on to  the  customer.    They  are  the  total  capital  investment  cost  divided  by  the  total  annual maximum capacity (not output) of the plant as shown in Figure 14.1.  Capitalized charges do not  include  all  project  costs.    They  include  only  those  projects  that  meet  real  property capitalization investment costs.  14.3.10.  Administrative  Overhead.    The  Administrative  Overhead  charge  is  equal  to  3 percent of the total unit costs for all other charges as shown in Figure 14.1. 26 AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 14.3.11.  Local Prevailing Rate.  The local prevailing rate is the rate the purchaser would pay for  a  particular  class  of  service  if  the  customer  were  provided  the  utility  directly  by  the nearest  off-base  utility  supplier,  as  shown  in  Figure  14.1.    Local  prevailing  rates  are normally published through the local utility company’s online website and include categories for  various  residential  types,  commercial,  industrial,  and  other  special  rated  categories.  Customer  service  requirements  should  be  analyzed  to  determine  which  local  rate  schedule would apply if the customer purchases the utility directly from a local utility provider.  If an applicable  rate  equals  or  exceeds  the  cost  to  the  government  for  supplying  the  service,  the local utility provider’s rate should be used.  If two or more rates apply equally but exceed the cost to the government for supplying the service, the lower of the two applicable rates should be used.  The local prevailing rate is not used when a Department of Energy (DOE) Power Marketing Administration is one of the installation's utility suppliers or when the use of the local prevailing rate directly conflicts with a utility supplier's regulation. 14.3.12.  Wheeling  Charge.    The  wheeling  charge  is  the  total  of  the  line  loss,  operations, maintenance,  and  repair  costs,  other  utility  costs,  capitalized  charges,  and  administrative overhead.  The following wheeling charge provision sample can be used in a utility service contract: “In consideration for the use of government-owned, on-base distribution systems to transport  utilities  to  (show  the  name  and  address  of  the  non-Federal  organizations),  the utility supplier agrees to include on the monthly invoice to the installation a deduction for the amount of utilities consumed by the non-Federal organizations and a deduction to cover the wheeling charge of (show the amount) per (show the unit of measurement [KWH, MCF, BTU or KGAL]).  Annually, the base Energy Manager recalculates the wheeling charge according to  AFI  321061,  using  prior  fiscal  year  cost  data,  and  gives  the  utility  supplier  the  updated wheeling  charge,  which  takes  effect  on  1  January.    The  government  may  revoke  this provision with a 30-day written notice to the utility supplier.” AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 27 Chapter 15 MEASURING UTILITY COMMODITY CONSUMPTION 15.1.  Meters  and  Energy  Data  Systems.  AF  uses  data  from  meters  to  build  future  utility requirements  and  define  energy  conservation  opportunities.    Energy  Managers  use  AF  energy data systems to enable energy costs savings by: 15.1.1.  Verification of utility bills/rate comparison 15.1.2.  Measurement and verification of energy conservation efforts 15.1.3.  Benchmarking building energy use 15.1.4.  Increasing user awareness and financial accountability 15.1.5.  Identifying operational efficiency improvement opportunities 15.1.6.  Focus on maintenance, repair, and equipment replacement 15.1.7.  Facility re/retro-commissioning 15.1.8.  Optimizing equipment life and improving reliability 15.1.9.  Assessing impact of utility price fluctuations 15.2.  Meters  on  Existing  Facilities.  Meters  are  mandatory  at  existing  facilities  IAW  Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) Guidance for Electric Meters on Federal Buildings.  15.3.  Advanced  Meters.  Advanced  meters  are  installed  on  all  utility  system  renovations exceeding installation commander approval authority, new MILCON, major renovations, Energy Conservation  Investment  Program  (ECIP)  projects,  and  Energy  Savings  Performance  Contract (ESPC)  projects.    The  AF  Meter  Data  Management  Plan  MDMP  establishes  milestones  for installing advanced meters and Advanced Meter Reading System (AMRS) as a cyber-secure tool to manage utility consumption data, change behavior, and achieve greater energy efficiencies at Air  Force  installations.    AMRS  requires  the  Civil  Engineer  Virtual  Local  Area  Network  (CE VLAN)  1.0  or  Industrial  Control  System  Network  (ICS  Net)  to  capture  data.    The  AF  MDMP identifies CE VLAN 1.0 installation for local systems and the ICS Net as a centralized system at higher  energy  consuming  installations.    Installation  of  meters  at  AF  installations  will  comply with OSD, FEMP, AF, UFC policy and EOs. 15.4.  Water  Meters.  Water  meters  are  located  at  all  installation  potable  water  entry/service points, on base well water facilities, and also on appropriate facilities serviced by the base water distribution  system.    For  both  potable  and  non-potable  water,  advanced  meters  should  be installed on all water-intensive facilities.  At a minimum, these facilities include: district heat and chiller  plants,  dormitories,  galleys/kitchens,  dining  facilities,  swimming  pools,  gyms,  golf courses,  piers,  dry  docks,  vehicle  wash  stations,  industrial  facilities,  hospitals,  water-intensive laboratories,  and  landscaping  systems.    The  installation  of  water  meters  for  locations  with significant outdoor water use is encouraged.  In addition, sufficient meters should be installed or other  leak  detection  devices  on  distribution  systems,  if  required,  to  effectively  identify  system losses.  Zonal meters are an option for use as systems age, leaks increase, or cathodic protection systems fail.  Information on measuring steam at central steam plants is found in AFI 32-1068, Heating Systems and Unfired Pressure Vessels.     28 AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 15.5.  Electric  and  Gas  Meters.  For  electric  and  gas  meters,  installations  conduct  and document, with AFCEC verification, the capability of existing meters installed on facilities, and upgrade meters or communication where appropriate. 15.5.1.  Installations  ensure  facilities  meet  DoDI  and  AF  criteria  and  conduct  meter feasibility evaluations to determine if advanced meters are required. 15.5.2.  AFCEC  ensures  AMR  project  installations  comply  with  ETL  09-11,  Civil Engineering  Industrial  Control  System  (ICS)  Information  Assurance  (IA)  Compliance;  and that  all  AMR  ICSs  comply  with  interim  IA  security  requirements  within  ETL  09-11  or  be turned  off  immediately.    Refer  to  AF  Network  Integration  Center  (AFNIC)  for  information on the standard wireless Platform IT (PIT) approved form CE AMR.  15.6.  Meter  Calibration.  Utility  purchase  contracts  have  provisions  specifying  meter calibration and refunds due the government when meters are not calibrated correctly.  The base Energy  Manager  keeps  a  copy  of  the  latest  meter  calibration  test  for  each  meter  in  the  utility service  folder.  Calibration for meters owned by  the utility provider is  the responsibility  of the utility provider. AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 29 Chapter 16 UTILITY CONSUMPTION 16.1.  Utility Consumption Estimates.  When meters have not been installed, estimating utility consumption includes:  16.1.1.  Inspecting motor nameplates. 16.1.2.  Determining what periods and loads the motors operate. 16.1.3.  Determining the amount and duration of electricity used for heating, air conditioning, lighting, and other loads. 16.2.  Heating  and  Air  Conditioning  Estimates.  Estimates  for  heating  and  air  conditioning may be made by using the methods specified in the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Handbook.     16.3.  Water  Consumption  and  Wastewater  Flow  Estimates.  If  possible,  temporary  meters can be used to  estimate  water  consumption and wastewater flow;  otherwise, the following best estimate  possible  may  be  used,  which  are  based  on  the  guidelines  in  the  Federal  Water  Use Indices (see The Air Force Water Conservation Guidebook) available from AFCEC: 16.3.1.  75 gallons per day per person residing in a mobile home. 16.3.2.  150 gallons per day per person for facilities occupied on a 24-hour-per-day basis. 16.3.3.  50  gallons  per  day  per  person  for  administrative  or  industrial  facilities  occupied  on an 8-hour-shift-per-day basis, plus any water needed for industrial or irrigation purposes. 16.3.4.  Estimate  domestic  sewage  consumption  by  using  70  to  90  percent  of  the  water consumption, depending on the amount of water needed for industrial or irrigation purposes. 16.3.5.  Estimate industrial wastewater flow for small users according to operational records, facility  visits,  and  the  observed  flow  during  normal  workload  periods;  accounting  for holiday, seasonal, and other unusual impacts when estimating average flows for small users. 16.3.6.  Estimate industrial wastewater flow for depot maintenance activity by subtracting the estimated  flow  for  all  non-depot  maintenance  contributors  from  the  total  flow  measured  at the  industrial  wastewater  treatment  plant.    (Depot  maintenance  activities  normally  account for 80 percent to 98 percent of the flow.) 16.3.6.1.  Estimate  average  flows  for  all  non-depot  maintenance  contributors,  including activities required to reimburse and those not required to reimburse. 16.3.6.2.  Calculate the  non-depot maintenance  flows  from  the  total  flow  measured  at  the  industrial  wastewater  treatment plant. the  depot  maintenance  flow  by  subtracting 16.3.6.3.  When  enough  data  on  total  flows  and  depot  maintenance's  flows  is  available, calculate the average percentage of total flow attributed to depot maintenance.  Use this total  with  monthly  or  quarterly  total  industrial  wastewater  treatment  plant  flows  to determine the depot maintenance's flows for billing purposes. 30 AFPAM32-10144  8 MARCH 2016 Chapter 17 AIR FORCE ENERGY REPORTING SYSTEM (AFERS) 17.1.  AFERS  Data.  AFERS  is  the  information  data  system  that  accounts  for  the  cost  and consumption  of  purchased  utilities  used  by  DoD  activities  and  is  used  for  the  annual  energy reporting to Congress.  Therefore, AFERS data must be accurate and timely.  Data is input into AFERS no later than 60 days after the end of month of consumption (or end of the established billing cycle). 17.1.1.  AFERS data is used to track energy goal  progress, analyze AF consumption trends, and  develop  long-term  policy  that  ensures  adequate  and  deliverable  energy  resources  are available in support of the AF mission. 17.1.2.  AFERS  includes  site-level  utility  consumption  data  for  AF  owned  and  leased facilities.  This includes remote bases or sites assigned to or supported by the reporting (host) AF base. 17.1.3.  Host bases and Federal reimbursable customers may mutually agree to report utility consumption  through  their  own  command  channels.  However,  data  is  coordinated  between hosts and tenants to ensure that consumption, cost, and square footage data is reported under one agency to avoid duplicate reporting. 17.1.4.  Utility information for non-DoD reimbursable customers is not included in AFERS.  Cost and consumption data for these customers is subtracted prior to input to AFERS.  JOHN B.

Installations  keep  a  utility  service  folder  for  each  supplier  providing  utilities  to  the installation.    An  organized  folder  for  each  purchased  utility  is  necessary  for  quick  access  to utility information.  If there are multiple providers of similar utilities, a separate folder for each provider ensures the tracking and reporting of a utility type is  reported as a single utility.  A 4-part folder works best for maintaining quick access.  The folder has 6 sections that correspond to each area listed below.   Excess and older documents are digitized (scanned, faxed, or converted to  PDF)  where  possible  and  stored  and  organized  for  similar  easy  access.    When  data  is electronic,  provide  information  in  the  folder  on  the  location  or  how  to  access  electronic  files.  Each utility service folder contains: A3.1.1.  General Data A3.1.1.1.  Customer account number(s). A3.1.1.2.  A map showing the point(s) of delivery and master meter(s) to the installation. A3.1.2.  Billing Data A3.1.2.1.  Billings for the last 24 months. A3.1.2.2.
