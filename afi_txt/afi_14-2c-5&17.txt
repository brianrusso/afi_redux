Initial  Qualification  Training  (IQT)  Formal  Course.  The  MAF  Intelligence  Formal Training  Unit  (IFTU)  [USAF  Education  and  Training  Course  Announcements  (ETCA)  Course ID:  AMC MAF IFTU] is the sole method of completing IQT.  Course prerequisites are noted in ETCA IAW the formal course syllabus. 3.2.  IFTU Attendance. 3.2.1.  In-residence MAF IFTU attendance is mandatory for all intelligence personnel at their first  mobility  assignment.    Personnel  who  have  attended  AMC  MAF  IFTU  in  a  previous mobility assignment will repeat the IFTU if the break between mobility assignments is more than five years (T-1).  When possible, IFTU attendance should occur prior to reporting to the duty station or as soon as possible after arrival at the duty station.  When a seat in MAF IFTU is not readily available, the unit should begin MQT prior to IFTU attendance. 3.2.2.  Personnel in full-time status (RegAF, ART, AGR, IMA on active orders) who attend IFTU after arriving at duty station must complete IFTU within 120 days.  Personnel not on full-time  status  (traditional  reservist/guardsman/IMA)  have  180  days  to  complete  IFTU.  Units unable to meet this timeline require a waiver from AMC/A2. 3.3.  IQT  Timeline  Waiver.  The  waiver  request  includes  the  reason  the  CWI  was  not  able  to obtain  a  seat  within  the  timeline,  the  actions  taken  to  obtain  the  seat,  and  the  individual’s scheduled attendance date (see example in Attachment 3).  AMC units will route waiver requests directly  to  AMC/A2  Force  Management  Division;  non-AMC  units  will  route  waiver  requests through  their  MAJCOM  for  endorsement  before  forwarding  to  AMC/A2  Force  Management Division (T-2). 3.4.  IFTU  Course  Development  and  Maintenance.  The MAF  IFTU develops  and maintains its  courseware  and  materials  IAW  the  Instructional  System  Design  (ISD)  process.    The formalized  course  content  is  published  via  the  ISD  Report  which  includes  the  course  syllabus, course training standard and course resource estimate.  This report is available for MAJCOM and unit review. 3.5.  IQT  Completion.  Individuals are provided a completed AF Form 4350, upon graduation.  CWIs will ensure documentation in the individual’s qualification training record (T-2). AFI14-2C-5&17  8 SEPTEMBER 2016 11 Chapter 4 MISSION QUALIFICATION 4.1.  Timeline.  All  MAF  personnel  will  be  Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC)  or  Combat  Mission Ready  (CMR)  by  the  180th  day  of  assignment  to  their  unit  (T-2).    If  mission  qualification exceeds 180 days, units will route the training shortfall report (see Attachment 3) through their MAJCOM channels to AMC/A2 (T-2). 4.2.  MQT  Program  Structure.  MQT  applies  specific  unit  and  mission  context  to  those skills/knowledge  gained  in  IQT.    Units  may  further  tailor  their  programs  for  intelligence personnel  with  current  qualifications,  prior  experience,  currency,  documented  performance  or formal training.  SIOs may use applicable portions of MQT to create a re-qualification program for  personnel  who  have  regressed  from  CMR  or  BMC  to  specifically  address  deficiencies  that caused regression. 4.2.1.  Intelligence personnel must complete IQT before concluding MQT, but subject areas may be trained concurrently IAW AFI 14-202 when logical (T-2). 4.2.2.  Personnel  in  MQT  may  participate  in  exercises  and  perform  intelligence  functions while supervised by a current and qualified individual. 4.2.3.  Personnel  may  complete  other  local  area  orientation  and  training  while  completing MQT. 4.3.  Knowledge  and  Task  Training.  Develop  unit blocks of instruction from lead command-provided  and/or  unit-developed  training  materials  to  include  unique  local  area  procedures relevant  to  the  tasks  and  areas  pertinent  to  the  mission.    At  a  minimum,  MQT  programs  will include:  (T-2) 4.3.1.  Knowledge MQT. 4.3.1.1.  C-5/C-17  Weapons  Systems  Academics.

Ready  Intelligence  Program.  In  order  to  maximize  training  opportunities  and  minimize artificiality,  RIP  tasks  should  be  conducted  in  conjunction  with  day-to-day  flying  training missions (e.g., RED FLAG missions, local live fly exercises, etc.) as much as possible. 32 AFI14-2C-5&17  8 SEPTEMBER 2016 Chapter 7 STANDARDIZATION/EVALUATION PROGRAM 7.1.  Evaluation Procedures. 7.1.1.  Prior  to  any  formal  evaluation  conducted  by  a  qualified  IE,  the  examinee  must  have completed  all  Mission  Qualification  Training  or  Specialized  Training  requirements,  as outlined in this instruction (T-2). 7.1.2.  Evaluators will give the examinee no less than four hours’ notice of the subject matter or briefing topic for the evaluation (T-2). 7.1.3.  Prior to beginning the evaluation, the IE  briefs the examinee on how the evaluation is to  be  conducted,  requirements  and  applicable  criteria.    The  examinee  will  accomplish required planning IAW the duty position being evaluated and  provide the IE with a copy of necessary data or materials (T-2). 7.1.4.  IAW  AFI  14-202  Volume  2,  evaluations  should  be  performed  in  a  realistic environment  (real  world  contingencies  may  provide  a  unique  opportunity  to  conduct  an evaluation;  however,  factors  beyond  the  control  of  the  examinee  and  IE  may  preclude  its successful  completion.).    When  evaluation  in  a  realistic  environment  is  not  possible, examinations may be conducted via an alternate method (i.e., simulated, staged, or by verbal examination)  in  order  to  complete  the  evaluation.    Document  the  reasons  and  type  of alternate method used in the Comments section of the AF Form 4350 (T-2). 7.1.5.  The IE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the evaluation to include:  the examinee’s overall  rating,  specific  deviations,  area  grades  assigned  (if  other  than  qualified)  and  any required additional training (T-2). 7.2.  Grading  Instructions.  IEs  will  conduct  the  evaluation  to  include  the  requisite  events  as listed in Tables 4.12 and 5.5, addressing the gradesheet elements and associated grading criteria included  in  Chapters  4  and  5  (T-1).    IEs  are  expected  to  use  their  personal  experience  and knowledge in the assessment of examinee performance and determination of overall grade. 7.2.1.  Each  of  the  main  numbered  elements  on  the  gradesheet  is  expected  to  receive  an individual grade of 1-3 (per the AF4381 instructions).  Sub-elements  are not  required to  be graded individually, but  are integral to the completion of the numbered element and should be considered in the grading. 7.2.2.  Individual  element  grades  are  considered  in  the  aggregate  to  determine  the  overall grade for the event (Q, Q-, U). 7.2.3.  Event  grades  are  compiled  to  determine  the  overall  qualification  level  (Q1,  Q2,  Q3) earned from the evaluation. 7.3.  Additional  Training.  IEs  are  responsible  for  recommending  additional  training  as necessary. 7.4.  Unsatisfactory Performance.  Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade (Q-3) are to  be  placed  in  supervised  status  until  recommended  additional  training  is  completed  and/or  a reevaluation  is  successfully  accomplished.    If  an  examinee  receives  a  Q-3  on  a  mission AFI14-2C-5&17  8 SEPTEMBER 2016 33 evaluation,  he/she  may  not  perform  mission  duties  or  specialized  duties  unsupervised  until remedial  actions are accomplished.  If an examinee receives a Q-3 on a specialized evaluation, he/she  may  not  perform  specialized  duties  until  remedial  actions  are  accomplished,  but  he/she may perform mission duties unless specifically restricted. 7.5.  Intelligence Mission Qualification Evaluation. 7.5.1.  Knowledge  Evaluation.    Knowledge  evaluations  are  conducted  as  part  of  the  initial and  periodic  mission  qualification  evaluations  to  evaluate  the  examinee’s  proficiency  in  C-5/C-17  weapons  systems,  threat  knowledge,  VR,  PR  and  FP  academics.    For  mission qualification  evaluations  (initial  and  periodic),  examinees  will  complete  a  knowledge  test from  the  unit’s  master  question  file  that  covers:    C-5/C-17  weapons  systems,  threats, personnel  recovery  and  intelligence  integration  in  force  protection  academics  (T-2).  Examinees will take a separate visual recognition test (T-2).  Knowledge examinations may also be required during specialized qualification evaluations. 7.5.2.  Task  Evaluation.    Assemble  evaluation  materials  using  current  intelligence,  unit tasking  and  AOR  scenarios  that  incorporate  all  appropriate  evaluation  requirements.    RAD involves  knowledge  intelligence  personnel  should  be  applying  throughout  all  areas  of  the evaluation  and  are  evaluated  as  subsets  of  each  applicable  graded  area  as  indicated  on individual  gradesheets.    The  following  guidelines  are  provided  to  assist  in  constructing evaluation materials: 7.5.2.1.  Manual Order of Battle.  The number of coordinates in the OB plotting exercise should be of sufficient volume to be challenging, yet not so overwhelming that the time taken is beyond that necessary to determine proficiency.  Examinee should have a variety of  threats/items  to  plot  to  ensure  correct  symbology  is  used.    The  exercise  will  include both  geocoords  and  MGRS  coordinates  (T-2).    The  scenario  may  include  erroneous information  to  mirror  the  fog  of  war  by  including  intentionally  incorrect  coordinates  or types of threats for that particular AOR, thereby allowing the IE to assess the examinee’s ability to identify errors and question the validity of information. 7.5.2.2.  Automated  OB.    Examinee  should  be  provided  with  a  variety  of  OB  sources from which to pull data.  Evaluate the examinee’s ability to develop and save threat files, insert accurate data, load, update and purge data to ensure quality control of the displayed data  and  question  the  information’s  accuracy  for  a  particular  AOR.    Ensure  the opportunity exists for the examinee to be evaluated on his or her ability to manipulate OB displays  and  print  using  the  intelligence  support  systems  available.    Evaluate  the examinee’s  ability to  convert  coordinates  between  geocoords  and  MGRS  and DD/MM/SS to DD/MM.mm. 7.5.2.3.  Intelligence  Briefings.    Briefings  should  be  assembled  from  information provided  by  the  evaluator;  message  traffic,  intelligence  reports,  imagery,  and  other sources  that  are  used  to  evaluate  other  mission  areas  may  be  used  to  fulfill  this requirement.  Evaluated briefings include pre-deployment briefing, pre-mission briefing, changeover briefing, and situation briefing. 7.5.2.4.  Tasking  Systems/Documentation  Information.    Scenario,  actual  contingency  or exercise  materials  may  be  used  for  this  purpose.    Provide  enough  information  that  the examinee’s  unit  is  not  the  sole  unit  tasked  in  GDSS  II/ATO.    Ensure  the  opportunity 34 AFI14-2C-5&17  8 SEPTEMBER 2016 exists to  evaluate the examinee’s proficiency in  identifying  and breaking out  applicable information  from  GDSS  II/ATO/ACO/SPINS  to  include  unit  tasking,  air  space  control, landing zone/drop zone (LZ/DZ), and combat search and rescue information. 7.5.2.5.  Intelligence  Integration  in  Mission  Planning    Actual  contingency  planning  or exercise  materials  and  imagery  may  be  used.    Ensure  the  opportunity  exists  to  evaluate the  examinee’s  proficiency  in  planning,  coordinating  and  conducting  the  entire  mission planning process. 7.5.2.6.  Debriefing.    Aircrew  debriefings  should  be  conducted  with  aircrew  whenever possible.  The evaluator may construct inject cards or coordinate with aircrew to identify a  particular  threat  scenario  for  the  debriefings.    Ensure  there  is  enough  activity  to represent  the  typical  level  of  detail  for  a  threat  scenario  commensurate  with  unit  AOR tasking.  Grade the examinee’s ability to control the debriefing, ask amplifying questions and recognize irrelevant information. 7.5.2.7.  Intelligence  Reports.    MISREP  and  INTREP  should  be  constructed  using information  provided  in  the  aircrew  debriefing.    Reports  should  be  completed  IAW MAJCOM/theater intelligence reporting directives. AFI14-2C-5&17  8 SEPTEMBER 2016 35 Chapter 8 EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING PROGRAM 8.1.  Types of External Intelligence Training.  Most units conduct two types of EIT:  Aircrew intelligence integration (AII) and Force Protection Intelligence Training (FPIT).  The CWI may determine if other personnel require external training and should modify training accordingly. 8.2.  External Intelligence Training Program Management. 8.2.1.  Only qualified EIT trainers will conduct unsupervised EIT events (T-2). 8.2.2.  The  Weapons  School  graduate  should  be  the  EIT  program  Manager.    In  lieu  of  a Weapons  School  Graduate,  graduates  of  AAMIC  or  FP  IFTU  should  be  the  EIT  program manager. 8.2.3.  Program  guidance  is  coordinated  with  all  applicable  commanders  of  each  unit  for which intelligence training is provided on a regularly scheduled basis (T-3). 8.2.4.  Document all external intelligence training.  Documentation should include attendance and personnel not trained rosters, feedback, and syllabus. 8.2.5.  Program Manager will: 8.2.5.1.  Develop  a  training  plan  for  each  major  area  of  intelligence  training  (T-3).  Training  methods  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to  briefings,  demonstration-performance, formal and informal lectures.  Training resources may include, but are not limited  to  threat-  of-the-day  briefings,  current  intelligence  briefings,  academic  training sessions, theater orientation briefings and weapons system videos.  Program manager will review training objectives for currency prior to the beginning of the training cycle (T-3). 8.2.5.2.  Ensure EIT tests are administered to aircrew annually (T-3). 8.2.5.3.  Actively  solicit requirements (T-3). feedback to  ensure training  objectives  meet training 8.2.5.4.
