SAR  is  a  lifesaving  service  provided  through  the  combined  efforts  of  the  federal agencies  signatory  to  the  National  SAR  Plan,  and  the  agencies  responsible  for  SAR  within each state. Operational  resources are provided by the U.S.  Coast Guard, DOD components, Civil  Air  Patrol  (CAP),  Coast  Guard  Auxiliary,  state,  county  and  local  law  enforcement, other public safety agencies, and private volunteer organizations.  Services include search for missing aircraft, survival aid, rescue, and emergency medical help for the occupants after an accident site is located. 1.1.2.  National  Search  and  Rescue  Plan.  By  federal  interagency  agreement,  the  National Search and Rescue Plan provides for the effective use of all available facilities in all types of SAR missions. These facilities include aircraft, vessels, pararescue and ground rescue teams, and emergency radio fixing. 1.1.2.1.  Under the plan, the U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for the coordination of SAR in the Maritime Region, and the USAF is responsible in the Inland Region. To carry out these  responsibilities,  the  Coast  Guard  and  the  Air  Force  have  established  Rescue Coordination Centers (RCCs) to direct SAR activities within their regions. 1.1.2.2.  Aircraft  emergency,  distress,  and  urgency  information  will  be  passed  to  the appropriate RCC through an Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), Flight Service Station (FSS), or Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS). 1.2.  SAR agencies and responsibilities. 1.2.1.  The Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC), is located at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida and assigned to the 1 AF (Air Forces Northern).  As the United States' inland search  and  rescue  coordinator,  the  AFRCC  serves  as  the  single  agency  responsible  for coordinating  on-land  federal  SAR  activities  in  the  48  contiguous  United  States  while  also providing SAR assistance to Mexico and Canada. 1.2.1.1.  The AFRCC operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The center has extensive telephone  capabilities  including  a  direct  tie-in  to  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration (FAA)'s alerting system and the United States Mission Control Center (USMCC). to the  Cosmicheskaya  Sistema  Poiska  Avariynyh  Sudov 1.2.1.2.  In  addition (COSPAS)/Search  and  Rescue  Satellite  Aided  Tracking  (SARSAT)  information,  the AFRCC  computer  system  contains  vast  resource  files  that  list  federal  and  state organizations, which can conduct or assist in SAR efforts throughout North America. 1.2.1.3.  When  notified  that  an  aircraft  is  overdue  and  the  Preliminary  Communication Search (PRECOM) has not been successful, the RCC will: 1.2.1.3.1.  In  the  Continental  United  States  (CONUS),  and  Alaska,  verify  that  FAA has initiated an Extended Communication (EXCOM) search. 1.2.1.3.2.  In other areas, initiate the EXCOM.   4  AFI13-202  11 MARCH 2010 1.2.1.3.3.  Classify  the  aircraft  as  missing  and  notify  the  commander  of  the  base  of departure  if  the  EXCOM  is  unsuccessful.    If  the  aircraft  did  not  depart  from  an  Air Force base, request the installation commander nearest the point of departure assume the duties usually performed by the Commander of the base of departure.  (T-1) 1.2.1.3.4.  Initiate search and rescue actions.  (T-1) 1.2.1.3.5.  Make verbal or radio search progress reports (as often as practicable) to the commander of the base of departure. Include the commander of the base of departure as  an  addressee  on  all  search  mission  reports  (including  progress,  closing,  or suspending reports) sent to higher headquarters. 1.2.1.4.  AFRCC  formulates  and  manages  SAR  plans,  agreements  and  policies throughout  the  continental  United  States.    Additionally,  it  presents  a  mobile  Search Management  Course  to  Civil  Air  Patrol  wings,  state,  and  local  agencies  throughout  the United  States,  to  produce  qualified  incident  commanders  thus  improving  national  SAR capability. 1.2.1.5.  AFRCC assigns instructors to the National SAR School at the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve  Training  Center,  Yorktown,  Virginia.    The  instructors  teach  the  Inland  Search and Rescue Class throughout the United States and at many worldwide military locations.  This joint school is designed for civilian and military personnel from federal, state, local and volunteer organizations, all of whom are responsible for SAR mission planning. 1.2.2.  The USMCC is located in Suitland, MD and serves as the U.S. operational component of a multi-agency, multi-national program using COSPAS/SARSAT to detect and accurately position emergency signals from airplanes and ships in distress. 1.2.3.  CAP provides SAR mission coordinators, search aircraft, ground teams, personnel on alert status, and an extensive communications network. The CAP is the AFRCC’s primary air and ground resource in the inland area, especially for extended searches. 1.2.4.  FAA through the ARTCC and FSS facilities monitor and flight follow aircraft in the inland area.  In addition, FAA facilities initiate EXCOM actions outlined in FAA Order Joint Order (FAAO JO) 7110.10, Flight Services and this AFI. 1.2.4.1.  FSS  serve  as  the  central  point  for  collecting  and  disseminating  information  on overdue or missing aircraft that are not on an Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) flight plan. 1.2.4.2.  ARTCC serve as the central points for collecting information, coordinating with SAR,  and  conducting  a  communications  search  by  distributing  any  necessary  Alert Notice (ALNOT)s concerning: 1.2.4.2.1.  Overdue or missing IFR aircraft. 1.2.4.2.2.  Aircraft in an emergency situation occurring in their respective areas. 1.2.4.2.3.  Aircraft  on  a  combined  Visual  Flight  Rule  (VFR)/IFR  or  an  air  filed  IFR flight plan, and 30 minutes have passed since the pilot requested IFR clearance, and neither communications nor radar contact can be established. 1.2.4.2.4.  Overdue  or  missing  aircraft,  which  have  been  authorized  to  operate  in accordance with a Special VFR (SVFR) clearance. AFI13-202  11 MARCH 2010   5  1.2.5.  MAJCOMs  are  responsible  for  Outside  the  Continental  United  States  (OCONUS) regions  and  must  publish  region  or  theater-specific  overdue  aircraft  procedures.    National regulations or agreements adopted for USAF use in overseas areas take precedence over this instruction;  however,  every  effort  should  be  made  to  conform  to  this  instruction.    Refer conflicting procedures to  higher headquarters for  review and direction.   Include host nation procedures adopted for USAF use in MAJCOM supplements or equivalent.  (T-1) 1.2.6.
