These Qualification Training Packages (QTPs) were developed to enhance on-the-job training for Aerospace Medical Service Specialist, Independent Duty Medical Technician (IDMT), 4N0X1C personnel. As a trainer, the QTPs provide you with the breakdown of tasks into teachable elements. The teachable elements will help you to guide the trainee toward sufficient proficiency for task performance without assistance. QTPs are also used by the task certifiers/certification official to evaluate trainees concerning tasks which need third-party certification. 2. Review each volume and identify which modules of QTPs are needed for thetrainee’s job position. Core task items are identified with the number “5” on the STS Column 2; these items are the minimum mandatory skills which are required for all 4N0X1 personnel to be proficient in performing. You have the flexibility to arrange training for each module in the order that you decide. 3. Review the subject-area tasks in each module with the trainee. Direct the trainee toreview the training references to gain a better understanding of the objective for each module. If the trainee has any questions about the objective, clarify the behavior that is expected in the objective. Review the performance checklist with the trainee, and allow sufficient time to learn each step (some objectives may take longer to teach). Remember--the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and to allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task without assistance. 4. When the trainee receives sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on anobjective, follow the evaluation instructions. The performance checklist must be used as you evaluate each task objective. When the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document task completion appropriately in training records. 5. The QTP task completion is to be annotated on AF Form 1098, Special TaskCertification and Recurring Training, filed in training folder. NOTE: The individual check lists are not filed in each member’s training folder. A master checklist is filed in part 3, section B of the master training plan (MTP) six-part training folder. 6. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas which needremediation. Conduct a feedback concerning each module with the trainee, and document appropriately in the training folder. As the trainer, once you are satisfied that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, he/she will be re-evaluated until the objective is met. If the task which is being trained requires third party certification by a task7.certifier/certifying official, the trainer must first ensure that the trainee is qualified to perform the task without assistance. The trainee then will be evaluated by a task certifier/certifying official. The tasks which require third party certification are denoted with a “^” in Column 3E of the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). The qualification of training then is documented appropriately in the training folder. 8. The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing refresher/sustainment training. Suchstandardization  will  benefit  the  CFETP  training  concept  throughout  each  member’s career.  These  documents  also  will  be  utilized  for  assessing/certifying  the  Aerospace Medical Service Specialist, IDMT, 4N0X1C, each time that he/she is arrives to a new duty  station. The  QTP  developers’  goal  is  to  publish  a usable  document for  certifying officials,  trainers,  and  trainees  for  the  purpose  of  enhancing  on-the-job  training  for Aerospace  Medical  Service  Specialist,  IDMT  personnel.  We  value  your  first  hand expertise and we encourage your feedback.
