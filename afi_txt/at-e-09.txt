This handbook has been prepared for the air traffic controller using the Programmable Indicator DataProcessor (PIDP).  Included in this handbook are the necessary operating instructions for the system andthe effect on the air traffic control environment.2.  The increased performance of the AN/TPX-42, resulting from installation of the PIDP, will permit areduction  in  the  amount  of  voice  coordination  required.    The  PIDP  will  increase  system  efficiency  byallowing  a  controller  to  spend  more  time  sequencing  the  traffic  flow  and  less  time  on  repetitive  ATCcommunications.3.  The PIDP, when integrated with an ATC radar, provides a symbolic and alphanumeric display.4.  The PIDP provides:a.  Synthetic alphanumeric data in addition to  the  display  provided  by  the  AN/TPX-42.    Thealphanumeric data presented is of two types:  a track format affixed to all beacon video replies and atabular  presentation  of  auxiliary  data.    As  a  minimum,  the  track  format  consists  of  a  position  symbolcoincident with the beacon video.  A full track format consists of a position symbol, leader, and a four-line data block containing aircraft identification, reported beacon code or aircraft type, reported altitude,aircraft class, ground speed, fixes, and a controller message.  The tabular presentation of auxiliary dataconsists  of  operating  parameter  information,  arrival/departure/en  route  data,  drop/suspend  data,  andpreview area data.b.    Processing  of  target  reports  in  response  to  Mode  “1”,  “2”,  “3/A”,  or  “C”.    Two  hundredtargets can be tracked simultaneously with automatic or manual (controller-initiated) track acquisition.WARNING:  TPX-42 defruiter must be on to display targets replying on Mode “C” only.c.  Receipt of abbreviated NAS flight plans.d.  Recognition and identification of reflected targets.e.  Intra- or inter-facility handoff of tracked aircraft.f.    Special  code  detection  and  display  of  alarm  features  for  all  7700  (emergency),  7600(communications  failure),  and  7500  (hijack)  target  reports.    This  feature  may  be  inhibited  for  targetsoutside the facility auto-acquire area by master keyboard entry.g.  Capability for controller to view the full track format of a specified target, or all tracked targetsat any other active indicator positions.  This function is called “quick-look”.AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              27h.    Manual  suppression  of  displayed  data  via  controller-initiated  keyboard  entries  as  follows:Non-select targets outside the facility conflict alert area, selected data categories within the OperationalParameter  List,  display  of  Arrival/Departure/En  Route  and  Drop/Suspend  Lists,  and  selected  dataelements within the target format.i.  Automatic suppression or blanking of displayed data during data overload conditions.j.  Off-centering of display sweep and cursor origin.k.  Two keyboards per indicator which can function simultaneously.  This provision enables onecontroller  to  “work”  active  traffic  and  another  controller  to  perform  flight  data  entry/modification,handoffs, etc.l.  Assigned altitude monitoring of selected tracked targets for a deviation of 300 feet or morefrom assigned or present altitude.m.  Detection of “out-of-limits” conditions which result in an audible and visual alarm (associatedwith the offending target format) when a tracked target is at or below a preset, site-adapted, minimumaltitude limit.n.  Capability to display the bearing/range between any two positions on the indicator.  If the firstpoint corresponds to the position of a track, time-to-fly to the second point is also displayed.o.  Capability for the controller to accept or reject a beacon code change.p.  Detection of conflict alert conditions between a tracked target and another target resulting inaudible and visual alarms for as many as ten scans or until the conflict is resolved.q.  Send and receive local flight plans to FLIPS.r.  Can receive secondary target messages from the ARTCC if the radar is not functioning.  Thisfeature requires a “box” to generate the sweep and timing for the PIDP.s.  Up to three uncontrolled emergency tracks will have their bearing and range displayed in theOP List to aid controllers in locating them.t.    Capability  of  a  controller  to  inhibit  the  display  of  tracks  owned  by  another  indicator.    Thisfunction is called “quick-look inhibit”.u.  Capability to rotate the leaders of targets individually to relieve data block overlaps.v.  The PIDP version number can be displayed in the preview area if requested.28                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000w.  Local flight plans having duplicate ACID’s and/or beacon codes will be accepted under thesame guidelines used for NAS duplicates.x.  A flight plan can be displayed as a data block over a satellite airport indicating the airport is inuse for an IFR operation.y.  The indicator ID letter can be displayed in the preview area if requested.z.    A  satellite  airport  closed  for  IFR  operations  can  have  a  special  symbol  displayed  on  theindicator.  Up to six airports can be designated at one time.aa.  Trail dots can be displayed on all targets within the auto-acquire area or on tracked targetsonly.bb  Can check the MSAW altitude in a particular area of the display by keyboard command.The value will be printed in the preview area.cc.  Validation of the MSAW alarm function.dd.  Position Sign On.AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              29CHAPTER 1 - NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURESIntroduction1-1The PIDP must be loaded and initialized before it is ready to display the various types of targets.  Theseprocedures will be discussed in Chapter 3, PROGRAM LOAD AND SYSTEM INITIALIZATION.  InChapter  1,  there  is  a  description  of  the  equipment  and  its  configurations,  the  operational  functionspermitted,  target  categories,  special  replies,  system  features,  and  keyboard  commands.    Chapter  2explains special operating procedures.30                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000SECTION 1 - EQUIPMENTSystem Components1-2The PIDP consists of the following equipment:a.    The  data  processing  group  which  consists  of  a  computer,  floppy  disk  drive,  two  486computers, and modems (when interfaced with the NAS or Japanese ACC).  One of the 486 computersis  the  system  console,  and  the  other  one  is  to  run  the  FLIPS  program.    The  system  console  at  theJapanese sites, will have installed a Sync/Async Dual Channel Communication Card to interface the PIDPand  Japanese Centers.  The computer will drive up to 16 indicators.b.  OD-153/T indicator group which consists of a display, indicator  control  box,  <PEM>,  andone or two keyboards.c.  OD-152A/T indicator group which consists of a display, indicator control box, <PEM>, andone or two keyboards.1-3Data Processing Group Operating ControlsIn loading and initializing the system, the controller needs to be familiar with the control of four items:a.

Systems, interfaced with a FAA ARTCC, allow the controller to perform interfacility handoffs.Flight plan information is received from the ARTCC.  When a departure becomes airborne, a departuremessage  is  automatically  sent  to  the  NAS  system  making  manual  entry  on  the  FDS  unnecessary.CENRAP provides secondary targets from the Center’s radar to be displayed when the Air Force radaris inoperative.  The FAA is the circuit manager for the interface that connects PIDP to the NAS system.b.  Systems, interfaces with a Japanese ACC, allow the controller to perform interfacilityhandoffs.  Flight plan information is received from the ACC.  When a departure becomes airborne, adeparture message is automatically sent to the Japanese system making manual coordinationunnecessary.1-10 Terminal InterfaceSystems, interfaced with ARTS or other PIDP facilities, permit the controller to perform semi-automatedhandoffs with those facilities.  Up to four different PIDP/ARTS may be interfaced with one PIDP facility.Each of these adjacent terminal facilities will be assigned a number for handoff identification purposes.Each of these adjacent terminal facilities may have up to four different fix pairs, which will be assigned aletter (A-D) for handoff identification purposes.  Each PIDP facility interfaced with ARTS may handoff toa  specific  sector  of  the  ARTS.    Each  ARTS  sector  will  be  assigned  a  letter  (A-Z)  for  handoffidentification purposes.1-11FLIPS InterfaceThe FLIPS interface allows facilities to enter local and training flight plans and print strips.  Flight plansand local tracks started on the PIDP will be forwarded to FLIPS for storage and a printed strip ifdesired.  Training strips created on the FLIPS and forwarded to PIDP will be assigned current time andbe sent only to displays designated as training.  (If there are no training displays designated, the trainingflight plans will be ignored.)  Certain reports can be generated using the FLIPS.  Flight plans initiated onthe PIDP may not be retained by PIDP.  They will be forwarded to FLIPS, and FLIPS will send themto PIDP at a set parameter before activation time. Flight plan information received by PIDP fromJapanese ACC will be forward to FLIPS for storage and strip printing.34                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 20001-12Facility ConfigurationDuring installation of PIDP, the system’s hardware is configured according to the total number of displaysinstalled.    These  displays  are  identified  by  letter  designators.    The  letter  designators  are  used  for  thefollowing:a.    As  a  position  symbol  for  a  controlled  tracked  target  on  non-controlling  displays.    If  theposition symbol is A, indicator A controls the target.b.    As  a  designator  during  a  handoff  sequence.    The  handoff  message  will  specify  a  from/torelationship using letter designators.c.    For  identifying  the  display  for  configuration  of  arrival,  departure,  en  route,  and  the  masterdisplay.d.  For special functions such as quick look and diagnostic testing.1-13 Arrival-Departure-En Route-Training DesignationFlight  plan  data  will  be  sent  to  all  displays  regardless  of  the  type  (arrival,  departure,  or  en  route)  anddisplay  AR,  DE,  or  EN.    “Training”  will  receive  all  training  flight  plans  regardless  of  type.    When  theprogram is loaded or restarted, all displays will be designated AR, DE, and EN.  Indicators may then bedesignated, with the reconfiguration command, to have any combination or none of these three functions.The training designation overwrites the others.1-14 Master Designation and Display FunctionsThe display that has supervisory control is the master.  When the program is loaded or restarted, the firstactive display will be designated as the master.  The master has the following special features:a.  Must enter the  barometric  pressure  followed  by  the  year,  month,  day,  and  time  when  theprogram is first loaded or restarted.b.  Can change the barometric pressure.c.  Can change mode of operation to live or simulation.d.  Can initiate a “master message” that is displayed on all indicator groups.e.  Can modify A/D entry time.f.  Can modify the day and time.AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              35g.

The first group, colored white, contains the alphabet and numeric block of keys.  Some of thealphabet keys have a dual purpose and are also used to specify tabular display areas.  Certain keys in thenumeric block are also used to define leader/format direction.b.  The second group, colored yellow, contains the format control keys, data entry identifiers,track control, editing keys, entry and terminator keys, and track and special (SPEC) keys.c.  A dimmer control is used to provide variable illumination of the keyboard keys.1-16Position Entry ModuleThe <PEM> trackball controls the movement of ¯the direction that the trackball is moved.  The ¯near the trackball are used to: or (cid:176) on the indicator screen.  The ¯ or (cid:176) moves in or (cid:176) and the push buttons on the OD-153/T locateda.  Define a particular target when the ¯ and HOOK key are used.b.  If the <PEM> is not located directly over a target, HK will appear in the preview area.c.  Specify a position on the indicator to which the sweep origin will be moved when the ¯ andthe HOOK key are used.d.  Specify a position  on the indicator to which the cursor origin will be moved when the ¯ andthe HOOK key are used.e.  If cursor or sweep needs to be moved to a point where an aircraft is currently located, theHOOK key can be pressed, while the ¯ is away from the target, then moved to the needed position.f.  Specify where one of the tabular areas is to be moved when the  (cid:176) and the  MOV  keys  areused.g.  On the OD-153/T only, change the bearing of the cursor when BEARING ON is illuminated.h.  On the OD-153/T only, change the range of the range strobe on the cursor when  STROBEON is illuminated.1-17Indicator ControlAT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              37The  indicator  control  replaces  the  TPX-42  control  indicator  C-8625/T  (commonly  known  as  the  “A-BOX”).  Since code filtering and altitude filtering are now done via the keyboard, the new control boxperforms only the following functions:a.  Selection of mode interface, “1C”, “2C”, or “3C”, and mode readback from the TPX-42.b.  TPX-42 system performance, visual warning and audible alarm.c.  Bracket and character (format) intensity controls.d.    Computer  engage/disengage  to  electrically  connect  or  disconnect  the  display  to/from  thecomputer.e.

Preview Area.b.  Operational Parameter (OP) List.c.  Drop/Suspend (D/S) List.d.  Arrival/Departure (A/D) List.NOTE:    Should  any  of  the  data  areas  be  placed  partially  off  screen,  display  off  screen  blanking  willremove  every  other  line  from  view.    At  a  dual  keyboard  indicator,  the  MOV  function  can  only  beaccomplished with one keyboard providing input.  Simultaneous use of the keyboards prior to completingthe  MOV  function  will  result  in  the  <PEM>  symbol  being  displayed  in  a  reversed  format  from  thatdescribed in paragraph 1-16 (circle displayed when square should be displayed).  This can also result inan erroneous <PEM> position being transmitted to the computer.  Should this condition occur, it can becorrected by disengaging and engaging the indicator control box.1-22Preview AreaThe preview area (Figure 1-1) displays the keyboard messages entered by the air traffic controller andpermits  editing  of  the  data  prior  to  entering  it  into  its  processor.    Each  keyboard  may  enter  up  to  39characters into the preview area.  A flight plan initiate key sequence may contain up to 45 characters.(They will not all be displayed at the same time.)  Though normally located at the bottom center of theindicator, either preview area may be moved by the key sequences:  MOV <PEM> PFigure 1-1 (OP) Operational Parameter List*39 CHARACTER PREVIEW AREA USED FOREDITING ALL KEYBOARD ONE INPUTS.*39 CHARACTER PREVIEW AREA USED FOREDITING ALL KEYBOARD TWO INPUTS.NOTE:  * symbol is used to indicate next character position in preview area.

The Arrival/Departure (A/D) List shown on the right-hand side of Figure 1-3 consists of a listing ofaircraft scheduled to arrive or depart or proceed en route.  Indicators which have been designated astraining displays will have only training flight plans in their A/D Lists, and non-training displays will nothave any training flight plans.  The abbreviated flight plan appears in the A/D List five minutes prior toarrival or departure.  This amount of time may be changed by keyboard sequence (paragraph 1-25-7).Up to ten arrivals, departures, or en routes may be displayed.  The A/D List displays an alpha character(A-J) to indicate the line number in the A/D List, the arrival or departure time, an A, D, or E to indicatewhether it’s an arrival (A), departure (D), or en route (E), the targets <ACID>, and the assigned beaconcode.  The A/D List is normally located at the right center of the indicator screen.  The A/D List may bemoved about the indicator at the controller’s discretion by performing the key sequence:  MOV <PEM>A.2.  The controller may, if so desired, suppress the A/D List.  To do this, perform the key sequence:   AENTER.NOTE:  When display of the A/D List is inhibited, the alarm “AD” will appear in the OP List.3.  To redisplay the A/D List, the above command is repeated.4.  Duplicate ACIDs and beacon codes are allowed under the following conditions:a.  Beacon Codes:  One flight plan and one track can be entered.  When a duplicate situationexists, a flashing virgule (/) will be displayed after the beacon code in the track data block and a steadyvirgule immediately before the beacon code in the A/D List.  Either the flight plan or the track must be anarrival and the other a departure.  They cannot be the same.62                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000b.  ACIDs:  There can be one arrival track and up to  two  departure  flight  plans  with  duplicateACIDs.  If there are two departures, the departure fixes must be different.  When a duplicate situationexists, a steady virgule will be displayed in the eighth character position of the call sign.c.  A local  flight plan or track can be a duplicate of another local flight plan or track only, andNAS flight plans can duplicate only another NAS originated one.5.  Should a duplicate discrete beacon code or duplicate ACID condition exist, the flight plan entry willautomatically appear in the A/D List regardless of the anticipated activation time if there is room.1-25-1Flight Plan Data Entry Procedures1.  Four methods of flight plan entry exist.  For those sites where the PIDP is interfaced with NAS, flightplans are entered on the FDS if available and then sent to the PIDP via the ARTCC.2.  Local flight plans can be initiated on the FLIPS terminal.  The flight plans will be sent to the PIDP viathe FLIPS interface.  Training flight plans entered on FLIPS can be sent to PIDP.  The flight plans willhave the activation time set to current system time by PIDP and will only be sent to displays designated astraining indicators.  If no indicators are configured for training at the time training flight plans are received,the flight plans will not be saved in PIDP.3.  The controller can initiate local flight plans in the system.  Procedures paragraph 1-25-2-1 describethe method a controller can use to initiate, readout, modify, or cancel a PIDP initiated flight plan.  Tracksoriginating from these local flight plans cannot be handed off to/from the ARTCC via automated meansexcept  ARSA.    Local  flight  plans  and  tracks  initiated,  modified,  or  canceled  on  the  PIDP  will  beforwarded to the FLIPS computer.  Printed strips are optional.4.  The controller can enter a VFR NAS flight plan from the PIDP keyboard.  The flight plan will be sentto the ARTCC who will initiate a flight plan..  Procedures in paragraph 1-25-2-2 describe the method acontroller can use to initiate the VFR NAS flight plan.1-25-2 Flight Plan Initiate1-25-2-1 Local Flight Plan InitiateThe flight plan initiate command allows the controller of any display position to enter data concerning animpending arrival, departure, or en route into the system.  The new flight plan will be forwarded to FLIPSbut will not be retained in the PIDP until approximately fifteen minutes prior to activation time.  If theFLIPS interface is not operational, a maximum of 75 flight plans can be input.  On flight plan initiate, acontroller may choose to “control” a flight plan by entering a special keyboard sequence, which uses the<TRK> key for the terminator instead of the <ENTER> key.  The flight plan will be displayed only on theoriginating indicator regardless of the system configuration or activation time.

The PIDP processes and displays four classes of targets:a.  Non-selected.b.  Selected.c.  Tracked.d.  VFR (1200 codes).2.    Display  of  two  classes,  selected  (targets  selected  by  beacon  code)  and  non-selected  (all  othertargets), are similar to that of the TPX-42 in that they consist of beacon code and altitude only.  The thirdcategory, tracked, allows for the added capabilities of the PIDP which will be discussed in paragraph 1-30.  VFR aircraft consist of altitude only.1-28 Non-Selected Targets1.  Non-selected targets are those targets not “selected” by keyboard action.  In the basic TPX-42, thesetargets were displayed by using the ALL A/C POSN, ALL A/C CODE, and ALL A/C ALT switches onthe A-Box.  The symbol for a non- selected target at a particular indicator is a small circle or the letterdesignator of the indicator that is tracking that particular target. A two- line data block is attached by aleader to the non-select target symbol.  For untracked targets, the first line is four digits representing theaircraft’s reported beacon code.  For tracked targets at non-controlling positions, the first line (TWA14in Figure 1-4) contains up to seven alphanumerics representing the aircraft identity <ACID>.  The secondline  is  three  digits  representing  the  Mode  “C”  altitude  in  hundreds  of  feet  and  corrected  for  localbarometric pressure.  The altitude may be replaced with the word “NEG” should the altitude becomenegative as a result of barometric discrepancies caused by mis-setting of related airborne altimeters, thePIDP, or actual flight level below mean sea level.  The second line of a tracked target will also contain theclass and ground speed of the track (Figure 1-4).  If the target is tracked and is MSAW exempt, eitherby code block or by track, the altitude will be followed by a caret “<“ at non-controlling positions.  If thecaret is steady, the target is not violating MSAW.  If the caret is flashing, the target is violating MSAWbut will not activate the audible alarm.  If the target is tracked and is CA inhibited, the altitude will befollowed by a “C” at non-controlling positions.  If the “C” is steady, the target is not in conflict alert.  Ifthe “C” is  flashing, the target is in conflict with another CA inhibited target.  The audible alarm will not beactivated.2.  The altitude, code, class and ground speed may be displayed/inhibited using a keyboard sequencedescribed in paragraph 1-50.  The entire non-select category may also be suppressed using a keyboardsequence described in paragraph 1-52.80                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000Figure 1-4Target FormatsTWA14060<H 50     \       ATWA14060<H 50          /        AMSAW Exempt(Not Violating MSAW)MSAW Exempt(Violating MSAW-caret flashes)1234280         \          oTWA14280 H 50   \     A1230///          \1234280/ TWA14280 H 50/           /1230///o        x         A        xNon-Selected TargetsSelected Targets       P        | T12342410155 H 43CODE 6      3       |T12342410155 H 43CODE 6UncontrolledTracked TargetControlledTracked Target035      \       ˜VFR Target(1200 Beacon Code)AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              811-29Selected Targets1.  Selected targets (Figure 1-4) are those targets that are code selected by the air traffic controller.  Thecontroller  of  a  particular  indicator  may  select  up  to  five  discrete  beacon  codes  and/or  two-digit  codeblocks to become selected targets.  Codes or code blocks are selected through keyboard action similarto the code thumb wheels of the TPX-42 A-Box.  (See paragraph 1-23-4 for exact keyboard sequence.)2.  The symbol for a selected target is the letter “X”.   The remaining portion of the format is the same asdescribed for the non-selected target in paragraph 1-27.  The altitude, code, class and ground speed maybe  displayed/  inhibited  using  a  keyboard  sequence  described  in  paragraph  1-50.    The  entire  selectedcategory may be suppressed using a keyboard sequence described in paragraph 1-52.1-30 Tracked Targets1.  Beacon targets replying on Mode 3/A codes may be tracked, either by automatic acquisition (auto-acquire) from previously entered flight plan data or through keyboard procedures.  Only the track ownermay  control  track  format,  initiate  track  handoff,  modify  track  elements  and  delete  the  track.    Trackcontrol as used in this sense should not be confused with procedural control of the aircraft.  When a targetis auto-acquired by the system, it is displayed at all indicators of the same type (arrivals, departures, enroutes, or training) as an uncontrolled tracked target  unless the local flight plan was initiated using theTRK key as the terminator or there is only one display of the type to view the track.  If one of theseconditions is true, the auto-acquired track will be displayed as a controlled track unless it is a trainingflight plan auto-acquire.  The symbol for an uncontrolled track is either a “P” or an “N,” with a four-linedata block attached to the symbol by a leader (Figure 1-4).  Uncontrolled tracks may be a product ofauto-acquires  of  NAS  or  locally  originated  flight  plans,  special  code  reports  (7700,  7600,  7500),  orauto-track.  Uncontrolled arrival and en route tracks originating from a NAS flight plan will have an “N”as  the  position  symbol.    All  other  uncontrolled  tracks  will  have  a  “P”  position  symbol.    The  first  line(T1234  in  Figure  1-4)  contains  up  to  seven  alphanumerics  (the  first  character  must  be  a  letter)representing the aircraft identity <ACID>.  The second line contains four digits representing the aircraft’sbeacon code, alternating with the aircraft type, followed by four character positions.  The code may befollowed by a pound sign.  The third line contains the aircraft altitude in hundreds of feet (three digits), ablank  space, a left caret, the aircraft class (B for heavy TCAS, F for Boeing 757, H for heavy IFR, L forTCAS-equipped Boeing 757, T for TCAS, U for heavy OTP, V for VFR, or W for heavy VFR), ablank space, and the aircraft ground speed (two digits representing ground speed in tens of knots).  Thefourth line is an optional message line of up to eight alphanumerics alternating with the airport fixes.NOTE:  Ground speed readout inaccuracies can be expected under various conditions of aircraft positionand maneuvers.  Readout should not be relied upon as an absolute value for purposes of traffic spacing.2.  Once the uncontrolled track is displayed, one of the indicators may take control of the track throughkeyboard sequence.  The controlled track format is now identical to the uncontrolled track format exceptthat the symbol changes to the letter designator of the indicator that is tracking the target on the non-controlling  displays.    (That  is  indicator  A  in  the  format  shown  in  Figure  1-4).    The  symbol  on  the82                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000controlling indicator will be a number designating the ID number assigned to the track for this display.The ID number will be displayed as a value from one through nine (1-9).  Track number 10 through 19will be displayed as a number one through nine enclosed in a circle, i.e., a 2 inside a circle equals tracknumber 12.  Numbers 20 through 29 will be displayed as a number with a box around it, i.e., 4 enclosedin a box equals track number 24.  If a display is controlling more than 29 tracks, the symbol for tracksnumber 30 and up will be the letter identifier of the indicator.  Individual elements of the four-line datablock may be displayed/inhibited using the keyboard sequence described in paragraph 1-50.  The entiretracked category cannot be inhibited.3.  For manual acquisition, the controller acquires the target by using the <PEM> or the aircraft’s discretebeacon code.  The controller now can enter the assigned <ACID> and any of the optional formats (class,aircraft type, fix one, fix two, or message).4.  Tracked targets have the following special system features that selected and non-selected targets donot have:a.  A tracked target can have its reflections identified with a question mark.b.  Tracked targets can be altitude monitored.  If their altitude deviates by plus or minus 300 feetfrom an assigned altitude, the system will initiate audible and visual alarms.c.    You  may  handoff  a  tracked  target  to  an  indicator  within  the  PIDP  facility,  to  an  adjacentPIDP/ARTS facility, to a NAS ARTCC, or to a JACC (see paragraph 1-38).d.  If tracked target reports cease, the track data block position will be automatically predicted(Coast - see paragraph 1-44), or held at the last reported position (Hold - see paragraph 1-45).e.    Audible  and  visual  alarms  will  alert  the  controller  if  the  track  descends  to  an  altitude  at  orbelow the preset MSAW altitude unless the track is in MSAW exempt status (see paragraph 1-41-1).f.  Audible and visual alarms will alert the controller when a tracked target is predicted to conflictwith another target unless the tracked targets involved are in conflict alert inhibit or exempt status (seeparagraph 1-49).g.  If a tracked target’s beacon code changes and only one target with a discrete beacon code oremergency is found at the track’s position, the track data block will coast for two scans.  Then the newcode  and  original  code  will  flash  until  the  controller  decides  to  accept  or  reject  the  code  change(Automatic  Code  Change  -  see  paragraph  1-48).    The  automatic  code  change  feature  (ON  atinitialization) can be turned OFF/ON by a keyboard entry at the master indicator.h.  Trail dots for tracked targets can be initiated using the TRK D keyboard command.AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              835.  Tracked targets that are within two miles of the antenna will be placed in dropped status when themode “C” altitude is below the minimum altitude for auto-acquire.  If the track is within two miles and themode “C” is invalid, the track will be placed in dropped status when the ground speed is below 50 knots.In each case, the track will reacquire if the mode “C” altitude is at or above the minimum altitude for autoacquire, and if the target reappears between two and six miles from the antenna within 64 scans.1-30-1Track InitiateIn order to initiate a track on an aircraft, the controller has four options:a.  Use of the <CODE> and the RD key, for discrete codes only.b.  Use of <PEM> trackball and HOOK key for all codes.c.  Auto-acquire through a PIDP, FLIPS, or NAS initiated flight plan.d.  Auto track.1-30-2Manual Track InitiateThe purpose of the track initiate command is to allow the controller to manually identify a selected or non-selected target and change it to a tracked target.EXAMPLES:DefCaptIdentOptionExecuteRemarks2341RDTWA1234<PEM> HOOK B<PEM> HOOK TWA13ENTERENTERENTERSearch by <CODE>; no optionsentered.Search by <PEM> using A/D Listidentifier for the flight plan.Search by <PEM> using matching<ACID> for the flight plan.23402341RDRDTWA12CLS HENTERSet class option.EA267CLS HMSG2 ACENTERSet class and message options.84                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000<PEM> HOOK TWA162341RDTWA1234ENTERSearch by <PEM>; no optionsentered.SP2 C141ACID SPACE FSASP3 SPAENTERSearch by <CODE>; set aircraft typeand fix options.Special Requirements:1.

After target is captured, the preview area will be blank awaiting further controller inputs.3.  If a beacon code identifier is used, it must be a discrete beacon code.4.  The assigned <ACID> must have at least two characters with the first being an alpha (letter)character.5.  The assigned aircraft type must have at least two characters.6.  If the controller uses an A/D tab letter as the flight identifier, that letter must appear in the A/D List.The code for the target must match the code in the A/D List flight plan and must be  non-discrete.    Thecontroller cannot do a code read sequence but must use the <PEM> as shown in the second exampleabove.7.  If the controller uses an <ACID> as the flight identifier, that <ACID> must appear in the Flight PlanTable.  The code for the target must match the code in the flight plan and must be  non-discrete.    Thecontroller  cannot  do  a  code  read  sequence  but  must  use  the  <PEM>  as  shown  in  the  third  exampleabove.  If there is a matching non-discrete code and a different <ACID> is entered, a separate track willbe started leaving the non-discrete flight plan alone.8.  When a track is initiated, it will appear in the track format in use on the controller’s display.  If thecontroller has the code inhibited on all tracks, the new track will also have its code inhibited.9.  The PIDP can track only 15 targets of the same non-discrete code.10.  A manual track cannot be started with code 1236, 7500, 7600, or 7700.11.

Auto track with a designated owner (paragraph 1-30-4).86                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 20002.  Auto-acquired (uncontrolled) tracks occur for the following conditions:a.    A  discrete  beacon  code  departure  with  valid  Mode  “C”  whose  flight  plan  is  stored  in  thePIDP computer and whose altitude is within the auto-acquire limits.b.  A discrete beacon code arrival or en route aircraft whose flight plan is stored in the PIDPcomputer and whose range is within the auto-acquire limits.c.  A discrete beacon code departure without Mode “C” which is more than two miles from theantenna.d.  An untracked emergency, communications failure, or hijack.e.  Auto track.3.  Once a track is auto-acquired (uncontrolled), it is now possible for any eligible display to take controlunder the following conditions:a.  Only arrival configured displays may take control of tracks designated as arrivals in the flightplan or auto tracks outside six miles.b.  Only departure configured displays may take control of tracks designated as departures in theflight plan or auto tracks inside six miles.c.  Only en route configured displays may take control of tracks designated as en routes in theflight plan.d.  Displays configured as training displays are not checked for arrival,  departure,  or  en  route.Only  training  configured  displays  may  take  control  of  tracks  designated  as  training  in  the  flight  plan.Training flight plans will not auto acquire if there are no training displays designated.e.    If  there  are  no  active  displays  designated  as  arrival,  departure,  or  en  route  for  an  auto-acquired track of that type, the master display will be in control of the track.f.  Any display may take control of an uncontrolled emergency, communications failure, or hijackthat does not have an ACID.g.    Should  the  auto-acquired  track  coast  out  prior  to  a  display  assuming  control,  it  will  beassigned  to  the    master  display  and  will  appear  in  the  master  display’s  D/S  List.    The  track  may  berepositioned or deleted only from the master display.  If this track is repositioned either automatically ormanually (see paragraph 1-30-6), it will be displayed as an uncontrolled track at only the appropriatelyconfigured display(s).  Auto tracks will be deleted from the system.AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              87h.

This is a master indicator function.a.  To utilize the auto track start feature, a controller selects and enters a start and stop code forthe block desired, the call sign of two to five alpha characters, and/or a specified display ID(s).  Up toeight code blocks can be assigned.  The first two digits of the start and end codes must match.b.  Once the auto track feature is turned on, the system will start a track on all aircraft within theselected code block as long as:(1)  There is no track or flight plan with a duplicate code or ACID.(2)  The aircraft is within the auto-acquire area.(3)  The aircraft is on a discrete beacon code.c.  If the aircraft is within six miles of the antenna, only indicators configured as departure scopeswill  be  able  to  take  control  of  the  auto  track  aircraft.    Outside  six  miles,  only  arrival  scopes  can  takecontrol.    If  there  are  no  active  displays  assigned  as  arrival  or  departure,  the  master  display  will  be  incontrol of the track.  Controlled auto tracks will occur if only one display is a possible owner or if thecontroller specified an active indicator as an arrival and/or departure owner when the auto track featurewas initiated.d.  The system starts an auto track by displaying the selected characters with the last two digits ofthe code as the aircraft’s call sign. Example:  A controller selects code block 2640-2665 with a call signof DUKE.  An aircraft squawks 2652.  The system will display an uncontrolled track with a call sign ofDUKE52.e.  If an operator deletes a controlled auto track target, the system will start a new track on theaircraft immediately as long as it is still within the auto-acquire boundaries.  The only way to prevent this isto turn off the auto track function.  The system will automatically delete uncontrolled auto tracks that arein coast mode.

The purpose of the track termination command is to allow the controller owning a tracked target toremove it from tracked status.  Under the following conditions, the prompt “ARE YOU SURE?(Y/N)”will appear in the preview area when attempting to manually delete a track:a.  The track originated from a NAS departure or en route flight plan.b.  The track originated from a NAS arrival flight plan, and a handoff to the PIDP has not beencompleted.2.    This  prompt  alerts  the  controller  that  all  inter-facility  handoffs  concerning  this  track  have  not  beencompleted.  If the controller is sure the track is no longer needed, then the track can be deleted from thePIDP system by entering a “Y”.  Subsequent attempts by another facility to make a handoff to the PIDPon this track will be automatically rejected.  If the controller determines that the track is still needed forinter-facility handoff purposes, an “N” should be entered; and the PIDP system will retain the track.  If aNAS track is deleted before a handoff is completed and it becomes necessary to restart the track withthe  proper  flight  plan,  use  the  “RF”  message  on  the  FDS  to  force  the  flight  plan  back  into  the  PIDPsystem.  A local track in the D/S List will be automatically deleted from the system after 377 consecutiveantenna  scans.

Included are theidentification  of  position  (IP)  or  special  position  identification  (SPI)  replies,  emergency  (7700  beaconcode) reply, communications failure (7600 beacon code) reply, hijack (7500 beacon code) reply, militaryemergency reply, and suspect aircraft (1236 beacon code) reply.  Descriptions of these special repliesare provided in the following paragraphs.1-33IP And SPI (IDENT)The IP or SPI (IDENT) target symbol appears as a “shrinking circle”.  For all categories of tracks andtargets, detection of an IDENT causes the position symbol to change to the shrinking circle at all indicatorpositions at which the target is displayed.1-34 Emergency, Communications Failure and Hijacks1.  Display of emergency, communications failure, and hijack beacon returns are processed in the samemanner.  Detection of these replies for untracked targets (selected or non-selected) causes the system todisplay the reply as an uncontrolled tracked target with a three-line data block.  The first line is the four-digit beacon code for the condition detected (7700, 7600, or 7500).  The second line is aircraft altitude,and the last line is a three-letter message specifying the condition detected (EMG, CMF, or HIJ).  Thisformat is displayed at all indicators, the entire format flashes, and an audible alarm sounds.  The bearingand range of the target are displayed in the OP List in place of the next code line.  When the emergencycondition is acknowledged or clears, the next code line will be redisplayed.  Up the three bearing andranges  can  be  displayed.    The  controller  must  acknowledge  the  condition  by  “hooking”  the  track  andassigning it an <ACID>.  Once this is done, the format will stop flashing and will change to a controlledtrack  format  on  the  indicator  on  which  the  emergency  condition  was  acknowledged;  and  the  audiblealarm will cease.  The emergency indication in line four will continue to flash.  At all other displays, the Psymbol is replaced with the letter designator of the controlling display, and the data block appears in anon-selected format with the emergency indicator in line two (see Figure 1-5, sheets 1 and 2).

Detection  of  emergency,  communications  failure  or  hijack  replies  for  a  controlled  tracked  targetcauses the system to display the track’s <ACID> with the new beacon code (7700, 7600, or 7500).The  track  message  line  will  be  preempted  by  a  three-letter  message  specifying  the  condition  detected(EMG, CMF, or HIJ) and the original beacon code of the track.  This format is displayed  only  on  thecontrolling  display;  the  entire  full  format  flashes  and  the  audible  and  visual  alarms  are  activated  on  theindicator control box.  The controller may now acknowledge the condition by the sequences:<PEM> HOOK or <ACID> RD3.  Once the condition is acknowledged, the alarm is automatically silenced and the full format will stopflashing, but the emergency message (EMG, CMF, HIJ) and the old and new codes will continue to flash.At all the other displays, the flashing emergency message will be displayed in the right half of the altitudeline, time-shared with the class and ground speed.  An emergency condition (EMG, CMF, HIJ) and codechange must be acknowledged before any handoff can be started.  If a handoff is already in progress onan aircraft that changes to an emergency code, the emergency condition is automatically acknowledgedwhen the handoff is either recalled or accepted.  As long as the tracked target remains in the system, thevisual alarms in the OP List and the indicator control boxes will remain activated.  Also see paragraph 1-55b.4.  Any target exhibiting one of the emergency conditions which coasts into the D/S List will cause theappropriate visual alarm(s) in the OP List and on the indicator control box to remain on until the target isdeleted from the D/S List.  Also see paragraph 1-24.1-35 Military EmergencyMilitary  emergencies  (Figure  1-5,  sheet  3)  are  handled  in  a  manner  similar  to  a  civil  (code  7700)emergency.  Mode “1” and “2” military emergencies will be received only if an indicator control box in thePIDP system is set for “2C” or “1C” modes.  When a Mode “3” military emergency is detected, thesystem will force the beacon code to be 7700.  The audible alarm will sound and control procedures arethe same as for a code 7700 emergency.  The only difference is that the controller will see four bracketpaints two miles apart.  The bearing and range of the unacknowledged, uncontrolled emergency will bedisplayed in the OP List.1-36Suspect AircraftWhen a suspect aircraft target (code 1236) is detected in the system, a flashing “SA” alarm is inserted inthe OP List.  It is impossible to start a manual track on a suspect aircraft, but the PIDP will accept ahandoff from NAS on an aircraft code 1236.  If the suspect aircraft is within the range being displayed,the target will be forced through all filters.AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              101SECTION VII - SYSTEM FEATURES1-37IntroductionThis section contains a brief description of system features and applicable keyboard commands.1-38 Handoffs1.  The purpose of a handoff is to allow the controller to select a track and transfer control responsibilityof  that  track  to  another  controller  at  a  display  in  the  PIDP  facility  (intra-facility  handoff),  or  to  theARTCC  or  to  a  Japanese  ACC,  or  an  adjacent  PIDP/ARTS  facility  (inter-facility  handoff).    Onlycontrolled tracks can be handed off.2.  Intra-facility handoffs can occur only on a tracked target within the PIDP facility, and are initiated bythe  controlling  display  (Figure  1-6).    When  initiated,  the  target  format  will  flash  on  the  originating  anddestination  displays.    The  track  message  will  be  preempted  and  replaced  by  HO.    The  HO  will  befollowed by the letter designating the destination on the originator’s display and receiver’s display.  Whenthe handoff is accepted, the symbol will change to the track ID number on the controlling display and thenew controlling display’s ID on all other indicators.  The format will stop flashing, and the format on theoriginator’s display will change to select/non-select.  The track fixes and/or message will reappear at thecompletion or recall of the handoff.  If a track in handoff on point out status from/to the Japanese ACCcan be canceled by the ACC.  When this occurs, the message “CANCELED” will appear in the fourthline of the track data block.3.  Other messages can override the letters designating the handoff destination:CONFLICTMSAWABVBLOOLD BEACON CODE DURING CODE CHANGE4.  Inter-facility handoffs with the ARTCC, Japanese ACC, or an adjacent ARTS/PIDP can occur onlywith  tracks  having  NAS/Japanese  ACC  originated  flight  plans  except  for  ARSA  handoffs.    Facilitieshaving PIDP-to-PIDP direct interface must have a track to initiate a handoff to the other facility.5.  On a PIDP departure, the system will auto-acquire the flight plan and send a departure message toNAS.  The controller can take control via keyboard action (see paragraph 1-30-3).  If the departuremessage is not acknowledged by NAS, a flashing “DM” message will appear in line two following the102                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000beacon  code  (Figure  1-7,  sheet  1).    The  departure  message  must  then  be  forwarded  by  other  means(FDS/FDIO/voice) or the ensuing handoff to ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP will be rejected.  Once the departuremessage  has  been  forwarded,  “DM”  can  be  cleared  from  the  track’s  code  line  message  area  viakeyboard action (see paragraph 1-38-7).6.    For  examples  of  inter-facility  handoff  formats  see  Figure  1-7.    Handing  off  to  ARTCC/JapaneseACC/ARTS/PIDP causes the track format to flash.  The message line will be replaced by “HO AAA”(AAA  being  three  (3)  alpha  characters  identifying  the  facility)  for  PIDP  to  ARTCC  handoff  or  “HOAAANN” (NN being two (2) numeric characters identifying the sector ID), if handing off to a specificsector.  The message line will be replaced by “HO AAA” when handing off to ARTS or “HO AAANA”(NA being one (l) numeric character and one (1) alpha character identifying the sector ID) if handing offto a specific sector.  If the enhanced directed ARTCC/ARTS handoff is flashed other than where thehandoff was originally directed, the handoff message line will alternate flashing the message of where thecontroller  sent  the  handoff  with  where  the  computer  designated  the  handoff  sector.    Handoffs  to  theJapanese ACC message line will read “HO N/T NN” (N indicating Naha and T for Tokyo followed byNN being two (2) numeric characters identifying the sector ID).7.  For ARSA handoffs, the message line will be replaced by “HO” “space” “*” “AAA”, (AAA beingthree (3) alpha characters identifying the facility).  Also, ARSA handoffs can be made to a specific ARTSsector.    For  ARSA  handoffs  to  a  specific  ARTS  sector,  the  message  line  will  be  replaced  by  “HO”“space” “*” “AAANA”, (NA being one (1) numeric character followed by an optional alpha characteridentifying the sector ID).  If the sector that you are handing off to does not take the handoff, the messageline  will  flash  “HO  *AAANA”  indicating  what  sector  you  sent  the  handoff  to,  with  “HO  *AAANA”indicating  what  sector  actually  took  the  handoff.    ARSA  handoffs  cannot  be  made  to  a  non-hostARTS/PIDP.8.  When ARTCC/ACC accepts the handoff, the PIDP will change the position symbol to a “Z” anddisplay the track as far as the auto-acquire boundary before the track is automatically deleted.  WhenARTS/PIDP  accepts  the  handoff,  the  PIDP  will  change  the  position  symbol  to  a  “Y”  and  display  thetrack as far as the auto-acquire boundary before the track is automatically deleted.  If the handoff is takenby  other  than  designated,  the  message  line  will  display  who  actually  took  it  in  non-flashing  format.    Ifenhanced,  the  directed  ARTS  handoff  is  accepted  at  a  position  other  than  where  the  handoff  wasdirected,  the  track  message  line  will  contain  “H”  “space”  “terminal  number”  “original  keyboard  subsetnumber”  “original  sector  identifier”  “/”  received  keyboard  subset  number”  “received  sector  identifier”.The position symbol will change to a “N”, and the format will not be flashing.  If during the delay an alarmcondition arises, the position symbol will remain an “N”, and the emergency, MSAW, or conflict alertwarning  will  flash  in  the  data  block.    The  alarm  condition  can  be  acknowledged  without  changing  thedelay  status.    Tracks  in  inter-facility  handoff  status  from  the  PIDP  to  ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP  will  beautomatically  placed  in  hold  mode  (see  paragraph  1-45)  if  beacon  reports  cease  for  more  than  fourconsecutive scans.  The frozen data block will continue to be displayed in handoff format.  This is to alertthe controller that even though PIDP is not actively tracking the aircraft, the inter-facility handoff is still inprogress.AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              1039.  An “IF” appearing in the second line of the track data block after attempting an inter-facility handoff orafter accepting an inter-facility handoff indicates a NAS handoff failure (see Figure 1-7, sheet 1).  If aNAS handoff failure occurs, coordination with the ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP will be required.  The handoff tothe  ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP  may  be  re-attempted.    The  “IF”  can  be  cleared  via  keyboard  action  (seeparagraph 1-38-8).10.  In ARSA handoffs, the system will send a flight plan message to the receiving facility.  When the flightplan message has been acknowledged, the system will automatically send a handoff initiate message.  Ifthe flight plan message has not been acknowledged, a “FP” will appear in the second line of the trackdata block (Figure 1-7, sheet 1).  The “FP” can be cleared via keyboard action (paragraph 1-38-9).After the handoff has been accepted, the fixes will display on the message line of the track data block.11.  On an arrival or en route handoff (ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP to PIDP), NAS will send a flight plan (A orE) prior to the handoff.  Selected facilities not having a NAS interface will have handoff capability via adirect PIDP/PIDP interface. Handoff procedures are the same as for adjacent ARTS/PIDP proceduresexcept that the receiving facility need not have a local track or flight plan before the handoff is initiated.  Ifa discrete code flight plan has been received, it will auto-acquire when the target is within the auto-acquirelimit.  Controllers should not take track control of auto-acquired NAS arrival/en route tracks until theautomated facility controlling the aircraft initiates a handoff.  When the ARTCC initiates a handoff, theentire track format will flash (Figure 1-7 sheet 2), and the message line will be replaced with “HO AAA”(AAA being three (3) alpha characters identifying the facility) or if enhanced “HO AAANN” (NN beingtwo  (2)  numeric  characters  identifying  the  sector  ID)  if  handing  off  from  a  specific  sector.    WhenARTS/PIDP initiates a handoff, the entire track format will flash (Figure 1-7 sheet 2), and the messageline  will  be  replaced  with  “HO  AAA”  or  if  enhanced  “HO  AAANA”  (NA  being  one  (1)  numericcharacter and one (1) alpha character identifying the sector ID) if handing off from a specific sector.  Thecontroller  can  now  accept  the  handoff  using  procedures  in  paragraph  1-38-3.    The  format  will  stopflashing.12.  Three special designators are also used in the code line message area during an inter-facility handoff,which are:  NAT, OLD, and AMB.  These will not be seen at units interfaced with non-FAA facilities.13.    A  NAT  (not  a  PIDP  track)  (Figure  1-7,  sheet  2)  in  the  code  line  message  area  of  anARTCC/ARTS/PIDP to PIDP handoff signifies that the PIDP is not receiving a beacon report for thattarget.  A special situation can arise if an auto-acquired arrival or en route ARTCC/ARTS/ PIDP track isin a display’s D/S List when the ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP initiates the automated handoff.  In this case, thetrack will be taken out of the D/S List and displayed as an uncontrolled NAT track in handoff format atall arrival or en route displays as appropriate.  The ARTCC/ARTS/ PIDP will continue to update thetarget position; and if the PIDP acquires the beacon target, the NAT will disappear from the code linemessage area for a discrete code.  If the ARTCC/ARTS/ PIDP initiates a handoff and no PIDP targetmatches the target being handed off giving rise to a NAT condition, and if the ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP stopsupdating its position, an OLD will replace the NAT in the target’s code line message area (Figure 1-7,sheet 2).  This will occur if the ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP no longer has a valid beacon report on the target.104                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 200014.    In  an  ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP  to  PIDP  handoff,  should  the  position  of  the  target  shown  by  thereceiving PIDP and the position shown by the initiating ARTCC/ ARTS/PIDP differ by more than twomiles, an AMB will be placed in the code line message area of the format (Figure 1-7, sheet 2).  This canindicate a possible problem in either system; and if it persists, maintenance action should be coordinatedwith the ARTCC/ARTS/PIDP.15.  Point Outs.  This paragraph is for Japanese Only.  The purpose of a point out is to allow thecontroller to transfer the radar identification of an aircraft to another controller if the aircraft will or mayenter the airspace or protected airspace of another controller and radio communications will not betransferred.  Point outs  with the Japanese ACC can occur only with tracks having Japanese ACCoriginated flight plans.  Point outs to/from Japanese ACC cause the track format to flash.  The messageline will be replaced by “PO N/T NN" (N indicating Naha and T for Tokyo followed by NN being two(2) numeric characters identifying the sector ID).

At many ATC sites, reflections of beacon (secondary) targets have become a major problem withautomated  systems,  such  as  the  ARTS-III  and  non-PIDP  TPX-  42s.    Reflections  are  caused  by  highbuildings,  hangars  near  the  flight  line,  and  other  obstructions.    These  reflections  cause  the  aircraft’s120                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000transponder  to  squawk  when  the  radar  antenna  is  not  pointing  at  the  aircraft.    Thus,  two  targets  arecreated, one true and one false (see Figure 1-8).EXAMPLES:  The antenna in Figure 1-8 is pointing NW and the path of the radar signal is, hangar - truetarget - hangar - antenna.  The radar system will place a target at the position of the antenna (NW) and ata range equal to the true target plus the distance to the reflector.NOTE:  Reflections should not be confused with so-called ring-around (three or more targets) which iscaused by misalignment of the TPX-42, operating on HIPOWER, or a defective airborne transponder.2.  The PIDP will identify only false targets of a true target that is tracked.  Reflections will be flaggedprovided  reflection  data  has  been  submitted  for  your  facility.    Those  targets  that  are  identified  asreflections are displayed as a non-select target with a “?” after the altitude (Figure l- 8).Special Requirements:Targets must be tracked for related false targets to be identified.Results:False targets will be identified and displayed.Errors:  None.AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              121Figure 1-8Reflection Discrimination1234330?         \oIdentified Reflection         /\      /      \      \      /         \/     HangarTrue Target        3         |TWA12341234330         21     |_ /Radar Antenna122                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 20001-40 Assigned Altitude1.  Each indicator position is capable of performing altitude monitoring by assigned altitude on  controlledtracked targets.  By so selecting the target, the system will alert the controller when the target is 300 feetabove or below an assigned altitude level.  If a value is not entered when setting the assigned altitude, thecurrent altitude of the target will be used as the altitude to monitor.  When the altitude entered differs fromthe current altitude displayed, the assigned altitude will be displayed by time sharing the class and groundspeed positions of the data block every scan.  Until the tracked target reaches the assigned altitude, anup-arrow or down-arrow will be displayed with the assigned altitude indicating whether the track shouldbe climbing or descending.  When the tracked target comes within 300 feet of the assigned altitude, thetime sharing will stop; and an “A” will be displayed in the right half of line two of the data block.  If aninvalid Mode C is received (///), the assigned altitude will be time shared on line three of the data blockpreceded by an “A”.  Should the target exceed the limit in either direction as shown in Figure 1-9, the fulltrack format begins to flash; and the audible alarm sounds.  In addition, the message line in the format ispreempted and replaced with the message “ABV” or “BLO” depending on the direction which has beenexceeded; and the assigned altitude, preceded by an “A”, will time share with class and ground speed.The  three-character  message  “ABV”  or  “BLO”  appears  in  the  last  three  character  positions.    Thecontroller may now acknowledge the condition by the sequence:  <PEM>  HOOK, <ACID>  RD,  or<Discrete Code> RD.2.  Once the condition is acknowledged, the alarm is automatically silenced and the full format will stopflashing, but the message “ABV” or “BLO” will continue to flash.  An assigned altitude violation must beacknowledged before any handoff can be started.  If a handoff is already in progress on an aircraft thatviolates  its  assigned  altitude,  the  handoff  can  either  be  recalled  and  the  violation  acknowledged,  orcompleted and the violation acknowledged by the receiving controller.  If the track is deleted, the pilotcorrects the condition, or if the assigned altitude function is dropped, the computer will automatically dropthe visual and audible warning.AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              123Figure 1-9MSAW and Assigned AltitudeLOW ALTITUDE ALERTING (MSAW)       P        |T123452410155   H   43       MSAW       3        |T123452410155   H   43       MSAWUncontrolled TrackTracked on Display A(Flashing and Audible Alarm)ASSIGNED ALTITUDE       3        |       3        |T123452410155   A  160BLOT123452410        A155   H   43       3        |T123452410155   H   43           BLOTracked on Display A.

A low altitude alerting called MSAW is built into the PIDP program.  Anytime a tracked target is at orbelow the altitude set for that sector, the full track format begins to flash and the audible alarm is sounded,except for those codes or tracks exempted (paragraph 1-41-1).  In addition, the message “MSAW” isplaced in the last four character positions of line four in the data block (Figure 1-9).

All  targets  within  the  conflict  alert  area  are  tracked  by  the  system.    Theconflict alert area is the auto-acquire area with a ten mile buffer added.  If the conflicting targets have validaltitudes,  the  audible  alarm  will  sound  and  the  data  block  will  flash  with  the  projected  flight  pathsdisplayed in flashing dots and the word “CONFLICT” in the data block.  If one altitude is invalid, CA willbe displayed in the data blocks, the projected flight path dots will be steady instead of flashing and theaudible  alarm  will  not  sound.    The  controller  may  acknowledge  the  conflict  alert  by  the  followingsequence:  <PEM> HOOK, <ACID> RD, or <DISCRETE CODE> RD.2.  When acknowledged, the audible alarm will silence.

The originator should forward a letter containingthe recommendation to ESC OL-D/E, 3580 D Ave., TINKER AFB, OK 73145-9155.  The changeproposal can also be telephoned to Air Traffic Systems at DSN 884-7004.184                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000CHAPTER 2 - SPECIAL OPERATING PROCEDURES2-1Introduction1.  Chapter 2 contains special operating procedures for the following system conditions:a.  System overloads contained in Section I.b.  Indicator overloads contained in Section II.c.  Equipment failures contained in Section III.2.  All procedures described are suggested actions.AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              185SECTION I - PIDP SYSTEM LIMITS2-2IntroductionThree system constraints are placed on the PIDP system.  These are:a.  Number of targets in the system.b.  Number of targets that are tracked in the system.c.  Number of flight plans that are stored in the system.2-3Overload of TargetsThe PIDP can process up to 450 targets per antenna scan.  When this occurs, an “IB” is placed in thesystem alarm line of the OP List.  The system will then begin to drop targets, and the controller will see awedge where targets are absent.  Solution to a target overload:  reduce the number of targets.  This canbe accomplished by selecting a lower RANGE SELECT on the TPX-42’s B-Box until the “IB” alarmdisappears.2-4Overload of Tracked Targets1.  When 200 targets are tracked, the “TT” alarm will appear on the system alarm line of the OP Listindicating a track overload.  If a controller attempts to track any additional targets, the “NO ROOM!”warning  will  appear  in  the  preview  area.    Also,  no  new  auto-acquires  will  be  allowed  to  take  place.Solution:  Delete all dropped tracks (those tracks that coasted into the D/S List).2.  The PIDP can track only 15 non-discrete codes of the same code block.  When this occurs and acontroller  attempts  to  track  an  additional  target  with  the  same  non-discrete  code,  an  “INVALID!”message will appear in the preview area.2-5Flight Plan OverloadThe PIDP computer can store a maximum of 75 flight plans in the system.  When an overload is reached,an  “FP”  is  placed  on  the  system  alarm  line  of  the  OP  List.    Should  a  controller  attempt  to  enter  anyadditional flight plans, a “NO ROOM!” warning will appear in the preview area.  Should NAS or FLIPSattempt to send any additional flight plans, a data reject will be sent by the PIDP indicating no room.186                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000SECTION II - PIDP INDICATOR LIMITS2-6IntroductionThe PIDP displays have limits imposed on them that affect the air traffic controller.  These are:a.  The number of characters permitted on a display (data blanking).b.  The number of flight plans displayed in the A/D List.c.  The number of dropped or suspended targets displayed in the D/S List.d.  The number of characters in the preview area.e.  The number of characters in the master/display message area of the OP List.f.  The number of select codes or code blocks in the OP List.g.  The number of next code blocks in the OP List.2-7Data Blanking1.  When the maximum number of characters is reached on a display (approximately 1500), an “OB”appears on the indicator alarm line of the OP List, indicating a display overload.  This condition causesthe system to eliminate certain blocks of data in a predetermined sequence (trail dots, non- select codes,select  codes,  non-select  altitudes,  and  select  altitudes).    Solution:    To  eliminate  data  blanking,  thecontroller needs to reduce the number of characters on the display by any one of the following methods:a.  Inhibit untracked targets outside CA area.b.  If the display is on a range that is greater than 60 NM, and if operational requirements permit,change the range select switch on the display to 60 NM or less.c.  Use the altitude filter to eliminate all unnecessary traffic, or consider limiting the range on theB-box.d.  Limit the TPX-42 interrogator range to no greater range than needed to sustain operations.2.  When the overload ceases, reverse data blanking occurs.  Restoration of data will occur; however, itwill take six antenna scans per format element blanked out.  Trail dots will not automatically be restoredby reverse data blanking.  Keyboard action must be taken.AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              1872-8Arrival/Departure List OverloadThe ten most current flight plans are displayed in the A/D List.  As flight plans are deleted from the list bymeans of auto-acquisition, automatic timeout, or manual deletion, flight plans are added to the List basedon activation time.2-9Drop/Suspend List OverloadThe D/S List is full when ten targets are suspended and/or dropped, and any additional dropped targetswill not be displayed in the list until room is made.  Should the controller attempt to suspend additionaltargets, “NO ROOM!” will appear in the preview area.2-10Preview Area LimitThe preview area of a display can hold up to 38 characters for editing entries.  Care should be taken notto overwrite the preview area.  This will lead to an “INVALID!” entry condition, and data will have to beentered again.  If a FP initiate is being done, 45 character can be held; however, when the message isbeing input, the rest of the new flight plan is not displayed.  You cannot backspace past the message field.2-11 Message AreaThe  OP  List  can  display  two  messages,  the  master  (system)  and  display  message  with  20  characterseach.  If 20 characters exist and an attempt is made to add to a message, a “NO ROOM!” error will bedisplayed  in  the  preview  area.    Satellite  airport  data  requested  from  FLIPS  will  overwrite  the  twomessage  lines.    If  a  new  master  or  display  message  is  entered  while  satellite  airport  data  is  beingdisplayed, it will not be displayed until the airport data is cleared.2-12Select CodesFive select codes or code blocks may be used.  If an additional code block selection is attempted afterthe limit is reached, the controller will get a “NO ROOM!” indication in the preview area.2-13 Next CodesThe first code of up to four next code blocks may be displayed.  This line will be overwritten with thebearing and range of up to three uncontrolled, unacknowledged emergency tracks.  The next codes willbe redisplayed when the emergency is cleared or acknowledged.188                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000SECTION III - FAILURES2-14IntroductionThis section provides special instructions for the air traffic controller in the event of a partial failure in thePIDP system.  The following failures are discussed in this section:a.  Power failure.b.  Indicator failure.c.  Keyboard failure.d.  <PEM> failure.e.  NAS/JACC interface failure.f.  Hard disk/floppy disk failureg.  VDT failure.h.  VSP failure.i.  System failure.j.  FLIPS interface failure.2-15Power FailureThe  computer  will  detect  a  power  failure  and  provide  up  to  two  minutes  of  operation  from  a  batterypower source.  If power is not restored in two minutes (commercial or back-up), the computer will halt;and the program must be loaded when power is restored.  (Also see paragraph 3-7.)2-16Indicator FailureIn the event of an indicator failure, set the 1C-2C-3C switch on the indicator control box for the faultyindicator to one of the modes already in use.  This permits the other indicator control boxes to select anymodes  without  being the  COMPUTERENGAGE/DISENGAGE switch on the indicator control box to DISENGAGE to electrically disconnectthe indicator from the computer.  All tracked targets controlled by the failed display can be reassigned toanother display by the master (see para 1-66).  If the failed display was designated as the master position,all master functions will be automatically reassigned to the first active display.inhibited  by   Also,  set the inoperative indicator. AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              1892-17 Keyboard Failure1.    If  a  keyboard  fails  and  there  are  two  keyboards  at  that  position,  have  maintenance  remove  thedefective keyboard.  If data from the defective keyboard remains in the preview area, perform the keysequence:SPEC <Defective Keyboard Number (1 or 2)> ENTER2.    This  should  clear  the  data  from  the  preview  area.    If  only  one  keyboard  is  installed  in  the  displayposition and it fails, the indicator can be used to control traffic in a limited capacity.  No other entries canbe  made  and  the  display  will  remain  frozen  as  to  the  selected  codes  and  formats  being  suppressed.Putting the display into diagnostic test mode may clear the keyboard.2-18<PEM> FailureIf  the  position  entry  module  <PEM>  fails,  maintenance  personnel  should  be  notified  to  arrange  for  itsreplacement.  The indicator can continue to operate in a reduced capacity with only keyboard acquisitionof targets possible, by use of a <CODE> RD sequence.  It will not be possible to start a track on a targetwith a non-discrete beacon code.2-19 NAS/JACC Interface Failure1.  The indication of a NAS/JACC failure is the flashing characters “IF” (interface failure) on the systemalarm line of the OP List.  If this happens, maintenance should be performed to correct the problem.2.  If the failure was sufficiently long, as judged by the chief controller, the NAS flight plans should bepurged per procedures in paragraph 1-64.2-20 Hard Disk/Floppy Disk Drive FailureIf a hard disk/floppy disk drive fails, maintenance personnel should be notified immediately.2-21 Video Display Terminal FailureIf the VDT fails, notify maintenance immediately.2-22 Video Signal Processor (VSP) FailureIf the flashing characters “PC” appear on the system alarm line of the OP List, it indicates a failure in thesystem, VSP, or in the T-4 simulator.  All indicator control boxes should be placed in DISENGAGEDand maintenance personnel should be notified.2-23System Failure190                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000Loss of a system means loss of all PIDP capabilities.  The displays should be placed in disengaged modeto  erase  old  alphanumerics.    Bracket  video  can  be  displayed,  along  with  primary  radar,  to  aid  inidentifying aircraft even with the display disengaged.NOTE:  After the hard disk drive has been initialized with the current program load, a dump disk shouldbe inserted in the floppy disk drive.  Some program failures will result in a dump being written to the diskautomatically.  A PIDP FAULT LOG should be accomplished.  If the system did not do the dump andtime  permits,  a  dump  should  be  accomplished.    Instructions  for  the  manual  dump  and  filling  out  theFAULT LOG are on the FAULT LOG itself.  The completed FAULT LOG and dump disk should bemailed to ESC OL-D/E 3580 D Ave., TINKER AFB OK 73145-9155.  A copy of the PIDP FAULTLOG can be obtained from ESC OL-D/E, and the facility should make additional copies.2-24FLIPS FailureThe indication of a FLIPS failure is the flashing characters “FF” (FLIPS failure) on the system alarm lineof the OP List.  If this happens, the FLIPS system should be rebooted.2-25 ASR FailureWhen the ASR fails, the PIDP program is still able to function in CENRAP mode (see paragraph 1-71).However,  CENRAP  requires  the  installation  of  a  special  box  that  generates  the  necessary  AzimuthReference Pulse (ARP) and Azimuth Change Pulse (ACP).  These pulses are used to generate the sweepon  the  indicators.    Once  installed  and  CENRAP  is  enabled,  PIDP  receives  target  information  fromARTCC  via  modem  and  displays  these  targets.    Special  requirements  (i.e.,  increased  separation)  willprobably be in effect when using CENRAP.  (See paragraph 1-71 for further explanation.)AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              191CHAPTER 3 - PROGRAM LOAD AND SYSTEM INITIALIZATION3-1IntroductionThis chapter deals with the loading and initializing of the PIDP operational program.  These steps must becompleted before the system can be used.  The PIDP is designed for continuous operation.  Once thesystem is loaded and initialized as described in this chapter, it should not be reloaded or restarted unlessnormal  operation  is  interrupted.    For  example,  a  program  load  must  be  accomplished  after  a  systemfailure or computer maintenance.192                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000SECTION I - PROGRAM LOADING3-2IntroductionThe PIDP operational program is contained on a floppy diskette and is used to update the hard disk withany program changes via a floppy disk drive.  The procedure to update the hard disk should only be donewhen a new program revision is received.  After updating the hard disk from the new floppy diskette, theprogram is loaded via the hard disk (see paragraph 3-4).  After the hard drive is updated, remove theprogram floppy from the disk drive and insert a dump disk in the floppy disk drive.  Initialization is donefrom the master keyboard (see paragraph 3-5).3-3System Turn-On ProcedureTurn-on procedures are provided in Tables 3-1 through 3-2.  These procedures allow the operator toturn the system on from a completely de-energized status.3-4Program Loading ProcedureThe following sequence provides instructions to update the hard drive with a new operational programusing the floppy disk drive.a.  Turn on the system console.  The floppy disk drive should be on.  Place the PIDP programdisk in the floppy disk drive.b.  Depress the system reset switch (RST).  If nothing happens, the lock switch on the computerfrom panel may be on and needs to be switched to off.  (The switch should always be “OFF”.)c.  On the system console, type B (SPACE) 24 and press ENTER.  The operating system loadmenu will appear.  When this happens you have approximately 45 seconds to enter 2 ENTER.d.  The technical maintenance menu will appear.  When this happens, enter 6 ENTER.e.  When the pathname is asked,  answer update.sys and press ENTER.f.  When the “override default specs” appears, press ENTER.g.  When the next question is asked, always press Y ENTER.h.  Type RES and press ENTER.i.  Then enter B (SPACE) 24 and press ENTER.  From this the program will automatically load.To avoid the 45 second delay, press ENTER when the operating system load menu appears.AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              193j.  Remove the load disk from the floppy disk drive and insert a dump disk in the drive.2.  The following instructions should be followed to load the PIDP program when power is on.a.  Remove the dump disk from the floppy disk drive.b.  Turn on the system console and the floppy disk drive.  Depress system reset (RST) switch onCPU front panel.c.  Type B (SPACE) 24 and press ENTER.  The operating system load menu will appear, andthe program will load automatically.  To avoid waiting 45 seconds for the program to load, press ENTERwhen the operating system load menu appears.d.  Insert a dump disk in the floppy disk drive.3.  To  load  the  PIDP  program  when  power  is  off,  TURN  POWER  ON  and  floppy  disk  drive  on.Remove the dump disk from the floppy disk drive.  The program will automatically load.  To avoidwaiting 45 seconds at each of the prompts, press ENTER when they appear.  Insert a dump disk inthe floppy disk drive.194                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000SECTION II - INITIALIZATION3-5Program Initialization1.    This  paragraph  provides  instructions  to  initialize  the  operational  program.    Initialization  consists  ofentering  the  barometer,  followed  by  the  date  and  time  from  the  master  display.    Initialization  must  beaccomplished after the operational program has been loaded into the system (paragraph 3-4), or afterdoing a program restart (paragraph 3-6).2.    When  the  program  is  loaded  or  restarted,  the  first  active  display  will  be  designated  as  the  masterdisplay.  The OP List will appear on all engaged displays in the following format:T 00 00:00:00 B 29.92 A 000-999C 000.0 S 000.0 (OD-153/T only)LOAD 62P0VPS1  (Current load # and Base ID)AR DE ENM=A (assuming display A is engaged)3.  The displayed time will now begin to update and the master display must now enter the barometersetting followed by the year/month/day/hour/minute command (paragraph 1-23-8).  An entry from anyother display or an entry other than to initialize  barometer or time from the master will cause an errorcondition.4.  Once the master has entered the barometer followed by the date and time, all engaged displays willthen be operational.  The system is now ready for use with the following preset parameters:a.  Mode of Operation - Live (paragraph 1-68).b.  MSAW Exemption - None (paragraph 1-41-1).c.  A/D Entry Time - 5 minutes (paragraph 1-25-7).d.  Auto-Acquire Leader Direction - South (paragraph 1-54).e.  NAS/PIDP Identifiers - As submitted by the facility (paragraph 1-65).f.  System Configuration - All active displays are designated as arrival, departure, and en route.Additionally, the first active display is also the master.5.    The  master  display  can  change  any  of  the  parameters  by  keyboard  action  without  stopping  theprogram.  However, if the year or month must be changed, a restart and initialization are required.AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              195Table 3-1Data Processing Group Switch SettingsUNITSWITCHPOSITIONFloppy Disk Drive VDTModem (Penril)COMPUTERPOWERONLINEPushed for power ONSCP-CLI promptST-NORMAL-DLAL-NORMAL-RONORMAL (Centered Position)NORMAL (Centered Position)POWERSYSTEM BOOT-RSTCENTERCONSOLE RST LOCKONCENTEROFFMODEM (Paradyne)CONFIGURATIONDTEALL BUTTONS2AOUT196                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000Table 3-2Indicator Group Switch SettingsUNITSWITCHPOSITIONIndicator GroupAC POWER ON-OFFONOD-152A/T andOD-153/TPRETRIG(BEACON/RADAR)RADAR VIDEO (OD-153/T Only)RADARNORMAL/MTIRADAR VIDEO SELECT(OD-152A/T Only)4MTI INTERVALInclude MTI targets within clutterregionMTI VIDEOFor desired MTI intensityNORMAL VIDEOFor desired normal intensityMAP VIDEOFor desired MAP intensityBACKGROUND VIDEOFor desired backgroundintensityCURSOR DECENTERED/ DECENTEREDCENTEREDSWEEP INTENSITYUntil sweep is barely visibleRANGE MARKSFor desired range mark intensityCURSOR INTENSITYFor desired cursor intensityRANGE STROBEUntil range strobe is visible on cursorFOCUSSweep and range marks clearlydefinedSWEEP CENTER/ DECENTERDECENTERAT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              197198                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000UNITSWITCHCHAR SIZEPOSITIONDesired size of alphanumericcharactersRANGE (NM)Desired RangePANEL LIGHTSDesired illumination of front panelCOMPASS ROSE(OD-153/T only)Desired compass rose illuminationCONTROL, INDICATORC-10501/TCOMPUTER ENGAGE/DISENGAGEENGAGEMODE SELECT 1C-2C-3C 3CFORMAT VIDEOBRIGHTNESSBRACKET VIDEOON-OFFBRACKET VIDEOBRIGHTNESSAdjust for desired alphabeticcharacter intensityON (UP)Adjust for desired bracket intensityAT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              1993-6Power Fail RecoveryThe PIDP computer will detect a power failure and provide up to two minutes of operation from a batterypower source.

The following sections outline localresponsibilities for implementing and testing new program versions.AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              201SECTION I - PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION4-2Introduction1.  PIDP operational program releases are made using FLOPPY DISKS.  We refer to these as loaddisks.  Interim releases and changes to site unique data are made as required.  Prior to release of loaddisks for other than site unique data changes, the program is thoroughly tested at ESC OL-D/E  and  attwo designated field test sites.  There are three reasons for releasing new load disks:a.  To fix known problems (deficiencies).b.  To improve the operational program (enhancements).c.  To provide requested site unique data changes.2.  A release may contain any combination of these changes.  A new release will consist of:a.  Two current load disks.b.  A Version Description Document (VDD).c.  Cover letter.3.  Site unique data changes will be accompanied by a cover letter without a VDD.  The VDD and coverletter contain instructions on actions to be performed before, during, and after implementation as well as adescription of changes and identification of the new load disks.4-3Program Load IdentificationEach floppy load disk is labeled for identification purposes.  The label contains three numbers:a.  The Computer Software Distribution Identifier (CSDI) is an ESC OL-D/E  assigned  numberthat is made up of an equipment identifier, system name, and date of assembly.  This number is for ESCOL-D/E use only.b.  The Load Number (Load) is the only number that really concerns you since it is the numberreferred to by ESC OL-D/E in correspondence with you.  The first two digits of this number identify theload.  If the load contains temporary corrections, a “P” will follow the load identifier along with a numberindicating how many corrections are included.  Next is the three-letter site identifier for your facility, andfollowing that is a number indicating how many site unique data changes have been implemented for yourfacility.  A “1” indicates the original release.  A “2” would indicate the first site unique data change after202                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000the original release, a “3” would indicate the second change, and so on.  This number will be reset to “1”each time the three-digit load identifier or one-digit “P” number is changed.c.  The Computer Program Identification Number (CPIN) is a number assigned to programs ofembedded computer systems as required by AFR 800- series regulations.  The last three digits identifywhich revision is on the load disk and are the only numbers that change.  This number is also for ESCOL-D/E use only.4-4Facility Requirements1.  Each PIDP facility should always have on hand:a.  Two floppy disks of the latest program version as the operational load.b.  The latest VDD describing the difference between the operational load and the backup load.c.  A copy of the most recent Performance Evaluation Test (PET) document.d.  Floppy disks for dump purposes.2.  Dump disks can be any 3 ½-inch floppy that has been high density formatted.4-5Replacement SoftwareAll disks, including backup disks, should be loaded and initialized upon receipt for verification of diskquality.  If for any reason a disk does not load, it should be returned to ESC OL-D/E  immediately  forreplacement.  It is important that all superseded load disks be returned to ESC OL-D/E for use and toassure  that  uniformity  of  software  is  maintained  at  all  PIDP  facilities.    The  VDD/cover  letter  tells  youwhich disk is the current load and which disk is the backup load.  All other load disks must be returned.In addition, it is important that you advise ESC OL-D/E by telephone or message when you receive anynew load disk or PET document, and the date you implement the new load.4-6Performance Evaluation Test RequirementsValidation testing using the PET document must be accomplished before each new version (indicated by achange to the load identifier) is implemented.  If a change is minor (only the “P” number changes) or if it isa site unique data change only, validation testing may not be required.  The VDD/cover letter will tell youif a PET is required.AT-E-09, 1 August 2000                                                                                                              203SECTION II - TEST FACILITY PROCEDURES4-7IntroductionBefore any new version of the PIDP operational program is released for operational use at all facilities, itmust be thoroughly tested to ensure it operates correctly.  This testing is accomplished in two phases:a.    Phase  1  is  a  test  conducted  at  ESC  OL-D/E  utilizing  a  PIDP  mock-up  system.    This  testsimply assures that the program responds correctly to input data.b.  The second phase of the testing process is the operational verification.  This test  is  used  toinsure that an ATC facility can operate with the new program version.  Many times this test will revealproblems  within  the  program  which  were  not  apparent  at  ESC  OL-D/E  simply  because  of  the  addedworkload an actual operation can put on the system.4-8Test SitesDue to the need to exercise the program under a full load and to insure that all portions of the programare exercised, this operational verification test will be conducted at designated facilities having high densityair traffic. Direct coordination is authorized between ESC OL-D/E  and  the  designated  test  facility.    Alldesignated test sites must be aware of the requirements for operational verification in case they are taskedto be the testing facility. The current list of test sites includes Sheppard, Tyndall, and Eglin AFBs.  Twofacilities are used to field test each new version of the PIDP operational program.  Field tests necessaryfor deficiency corrections are conducted at one facility on an as required basis.4-9Field Test ProceduresThe  following  procedures  must  be  followed  prior  to  implementing  a  new  test  version  of  the  PIDPprogram:a.  Prior to the inclusion of any enhancement in the PIDP program, the Computer ConfigurationSub Board will determine that the change is acceptable for use in the program.  Deficiency corrections areapproved by ESC OL-D/E.b.  ESC OL-D/E will then include the change(s) in a test version of the new program and willprepare and distribute to the designated test facilities a cover letter, two (2) new version program disks,and Field Test Instructions.c.  Within five days of the receipt of the new version disks, the designated test sites will put thenew version into use in accordance with the instructions.204                                                                                                              AT-E-09, 1 August 2000d.  The test sites will continue use of the new version for the time period specified.  During thisperiod, it is imperative that the test facilities:(1)  Document all discrepancies found.  Be as specific and complete as possible.(2)  If a program failure occurs during the testing period, the testing facility must completethe  PIDP  Fault Log.  This information and the program dump disk will then be provided to ESC OL-D/E as soon as possible after the failure.(3)  If failures or discrepancies are so numerous that the continued use of the test programmay cause a flying safety hazard, the new version will be replaced by the currently approved version.ESC OL-D/E will immediately be notified so they can begin investigation of the problem.e.  At the completion of the test period specified, each testing facility will provide the results toESC OL-D/E (DSN 884-7004) by telephone.  This notification must be followed within 24 hours with awritten test report.  The test report will include program discrepancies found during testing and a list of thetimes and duration of all system outages occurring during the test period.  This written report will be sentto ESC OL-D/E.  A copy of this test report may also be sent to the respective division, if required.  Upontelephone notification of the successful completion of program testing, ESC OL-D/E  may  allow  the  testfacilities to continue using the program version which was successfully tested.f.  If the tested version includes any enhancements, HQ USAF will decide if the new version is tobe released to all other PIDP facilities.  If the tested version contains only deficiency corrections, ESCOL-D/E may approve release of the new version to all sites.g.    Upon  release  approval,  ESC  OL-D/E  will  distribute  the  new  program  version  disks  andVersion Description Documents (VDDs) to all PIDP facilities.NOTE:  Prior to operational use of a new version, each site will ensure that they complete the verificationtesting using the Performance Evaluation Test (PET) document.
