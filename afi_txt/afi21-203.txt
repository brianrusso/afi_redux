(T-0).    This  direction  must  be  in  writing  by  the  Commander  and  is  non-delegable.  (T-0). 3.1.2.  Unclassified items do not require special airlift and need not be included in the NOSS.  However,  commanders  will  ensure  personnel  do  not  separate  mixed  loads  of  classified  and unclassified special test items and test equipment.   (T-1).  Commanders must ensure mixed loads  are  moved  using  a  security  level  and  procedures  commensurate  with  requirements  of the classified cargo.  (T-1). 3.2.  Specific Responsibilities for Transporting, Shipping, and Receiving Nuclear Cargo. 3.2.1.  NCP Responsibilities. 3.2.1.1.  NCP, for SAAM support, will: 3.2.1.1.1.  Consolidate  nuclear-related  items  on  SAAMs  when  possible.    Coordinate opportune  cargo  request  with  618th  Air  Operations  Center,  Current  Operations Directorate (618 AOC/XOOON), Scott AFB, IL, as required. 3.2.1.1.2.  Send  SAAM  requests  as  soon  as  possible  to  provide  618  AOC/XOOON maximum advantage when planning missions.  SAAM requests should be submitted NLT  90  days  prior  to  the  required  delivery  date.    The  NCP  division  will  identify airlift  requirements,  including  tentative  on-load  and  off-load  locations,  availability dates, and required delivery dates.  Keep changes to SAAMs to a minimum; however, submit significant changes as they occur.  Changes should be mission-essential with appropriate justification from the using command agency. 3.2.1.1.3.  When required, request a MTO from  DTRA to release or transfer nuclear cargo. 3.2.1.1.4.  Include  hazardous  cargo  information  in  the  SAAM  request  for  nuclear-related  cargo  not  listed  in  TO  11N-45-51A,  Transportation  of  Nuclear  Weapons Materiel  (Supplement)  Shipping  and  Identification  Data  for  Stockpile  Major Assemblies.

NCP, for DOE Contracted Aviation Mission Support, will: 3.2.1.2.1.  Provide  Time  Change  Item  Return  Schedule  (TCIRS)/Time  Change  Item Schedule (TCIS) (to include weapon type, serial number and expiration date, at least quarterly)  message  to  all  units  receiving  Limited  Life  Components  (LLC)  for replacement of expiring components in weapons and warheads. 3.2.1.2.2.  Provide Time Change Item Support (deliveries or preparation) message to MFD for support of future OCONUS SAAM shipment(s). 3.2.1.2.3.  Ensure the following logistics movement  information  is  provided by  DoE to enroute units and final destinations; the estimated time of arrival, departure, nature of cargo, firefighting, and handling and (SE) requirements. 3.2.1.3.  NCP, for NNSA/OST SGT Mission Support, will: 3.2.1.3.1.  Consolidate nuclear-related items on SGT shipments, when possible. 3.2.1.3.2.  Request  NNSA  transportation  to  support  NOSS  requirements  for  SGT movements. 3.2.1.3.3.  Provide  Consignment  Notification  Message  (with  MTO)  to  support movements to or from DOE to affected units. 3.2.1.4.  Non-nuclear or non-radiological assemblies/components support: 3.2.1.4.1.  Commanders  will  ensure  shipments  of  non-nuclear  or  non-radiological assemblies/  components  that  require  Type  II  security  will  be  accomplished  using transportation other than PNAF  assets provided  proper security is  maintained, ANG C-130  aircraft  with  armed  aircrew).    These  shipments  may  be  requested  via TRANSCOM SAAM.  Shipments of components not requiring special security may be accomplished through commercial means. 3.2.2.  MAJCOMs Responsibilities.  MAJCOMS will: 3.2.2.1.  Promptly  review  and  ensure  units  can  support  actions  identified  in  the  NOSS, NNSA transportation requests and SAAM set-up messages. 3.2.2.2.  Ensure  shortfalls  or  conflicts  are  reported  to  NCP  as  early  as  possible  so corrective actions can be initiated. 3.2.3.  Supporting Units. Supporting units will: 3.2.3.1.  Include  units    that  are  responsible  for  Airfield  Management,  Safety,  Fire Department, OSI, LRS and Security Forces functions.  (T-3). 3.2.3.2.  Ensure  all  persons  involved  with  logistics  movement  know  their  specific responsibilities,  including  those  relative  to  the  safety  and  security  of  the  nuclear  cargo and what to do in case of an enroute emergency such as accident, incident, or attempted AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 21 hijacking.    (T-3).    Drivers  and  escorts  must  have  all  available  information  on  road conditions, weather and emergency procedures.  (T-3). 3.2.3.2.1.  Coordinate all logistics (e.g. SAAM, SGT, DOE Aviation, etc.) forecasted movements  with    wing  or  host  nation  agencies  to  ensure  senior  leadership  has visibility and full wing support for the movement.  (T-3).  This action is necessary to prevent last minute cancellations and avoid conflict with the wing calendar of events. 3.2.3.2.1.1.  Munitions  Support  (MUNSS)  units  will  notify  host  nation  agencies within  1  duty  day  of  notification  of  forecasted  movements  and  keep  agencies informed  as  movement  dates  change  or  become  more  specific  (i.e.,  notification required for both NOSS and AMC Setup message receipt).  (T-3). 3.2.3.2.2.  For  AMC  SAAM  missions,  the  MASO  sends  a  copy  of  the  current Certification  of  Personnel  to  Receipt  for  Classified  Property  letter  in  their  SAAM acknowledgement messages.  (T-1).  If changes to the letter are necessary after initial acknowledgment,  the  MASO  will  distribute  the  revised  letter  through  the  same channels  through  the  same  channels  as  the  acknowledgment  message.    (T-1). Subsequent  minor  changes  to  the  setup  messages  for  that  mission  not  affecting  the content  of  the  letter  will  not  require  resubmission  for  each  acknowledgement.  The MASO  will  include  the  parent  MAJCOM  functional  office  on  all  setup  message acknowledgements. 3.2.3.3.  Develop  a  written  plan  addressing  logistics  support  according  to  AFJI  11-204, Operational  Procedures  for  Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials.   (T-1).  OCONUS units must develop and coordinate plan IAW host-nation support agreements.  (T-1). 3.2.3.4.  Organizations  requiring  logistic  movement  of  TYPE  3A/B/C  trainers  or  Joint Test Assemblies (JTAs) must forward a request through the MAJCOM to the NCP.  (T-1).  TYPE 3E trainers may be moved in CONUS by any available means. 3.3.  Military  First  Destination Requirements. (MFD) to/from  OCONUS  Shipping/Reporting 3.3.1.  NUREP  requirements  (shipper/receiver)  will  vary  based  on  airlift  mission  set-up message.  Specifically, intermediate storage locations and/or final destinations can normally be  deduced  through  careful  review  of  the  airlift  mission  set-up  message.    In  some  cases, direct interaction between affected MASOs may be necessary to ensure accurate NUREPs. 3.3.2.  The  intent  of  these  procedures  is  to  reduce  NUREP  errors  and  limit  the  amount  of shipping  paperwork  for  missions  that  involve  intermediate  storage  locations.  Mission planning  may  require  intermediate  storage  location  to  receipt  items  on  accountable  records while  at  their  location  prior  to  shipping  to  ultimate  consignee.  If  properly  prepared  by consignor, shipping documentation from originating location to final destination will remove the need for intermediate storage location to generate new paperwork for the final leg of the mission.    22 AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 3.3.3.  OCONUS Shipments. 3.3.3.1.  MFD  will  prepare  shipping  document(s)  and  release  cargo  for  shipment  as directed by NCP.  Shipments are made directly to final destination (ultimate consignee), unless cargo is receipted by intermediate storage location. 3.3.3.2.  MFD will prepare DD Form 1348-1A shipping documents IAW TOs 11N-100-2 or 11N-100-4, as applicable. 3.3.3.2.1.  Final  Destination  Only:    Enter  final  destination  in  Block  3  of  DD  Form 1348-1A and leave Block 4 blank. 3.3.3.2.2.  Intermediate  Storage  Location:    Enter  intermediate  storage  location  in Block 3 and final destination in Block 4 of the DD Form 1348-1A. 3.3.4.  OCONUS Returns. 3.3.4.1.  Shipments  are  made  directly  to  MFD  or  to  intermediate  storage  locations overseas for movement to the MFD. 3.3.4.2.  Shipper  will  prepare  DD  Form  1348-1A  shipping  documents  IAW  TOs  11N-100-2 or 11N-100-4, as applicable. 3.3.4.2.1.  Final  Destination  Only:    Enter  final  destination  in  Block  3  of  DD  Form 1348-1A and leave Block 4 blank. 3.3.4.2.2.

Appoint  a single individual as the MASO for each SRAN, and must meet certain minimum requirements such as grade, AFSC, security clearance, training,  experience,  PRP  certification.    If  a  different  individual  is  appointed  for  each  account (nuclear, conventional, or NWRM), then that individual is responsible for all items accounted for under the SRAN and type of account for which they are the accountable officer; they are not held responsible for items on the other individual’s account. 4.3.1.  MASO  Requirements  for  Nuclear  Accounts.    The  MASO  is  a  21M  Munitions  and Missile  Maintenance  Officer  or  a  permanent  civil  servant  (GS-11  equivalent  or  above), physically  assigned  to  the  munitions  organization.    The  MASO  possesses  appropriate security clearance, is PRP certified (Critical) and is a US citizen. 4.3.1.1.  In  order  to  have  a  working  knowledge  of  nuclear  weapons  accountability procedures,  the  MASO  will,  as  of  the  account  transfer  date:    complete  the  Nuclear Maintenance  Officers  Course  (NMOC),  the  Nuclear  Accountability  Course  (NAC), become  qualified  on  all  21M3N  MASO  requirements  in  the  21MX  CFETP  and  have  6 months of Nuclear Munitions experience.  (T-3). 4.3.2.  MASO Requirements for Nuclear Accounts without WR Weapons.  MASO must be a 21M  Munitions  and  Missile  Maintenance  Officer,  a  senior  NCO  in  AFSC  2WXXX,  or  a permanent  civil  servant  (GS-9  equivalent  or  above)  physically  assigned  to  the  munitions organization.    (T-3).    MASO  must  possess  appropriate  security  clearance  and  be  a  US citizen.    (T-3).    MASO  must  complete  NMOC  (21M  and  GS  only),  the  NAC,  and  be qualified  on  all  21M3N  MASO  requirements  in  the  21MX  CFETP  prior  to  performing MASO duties.  (T-3).  This is not applicable to NWRM. 4.4.  Control  of  Accountable  Systems.  The  MASO  is  responsible  for  the  accuracy  of accountable  records  (manual  or  automated)  generated  within  his/her  area  of  responsibility; therefore,  only  authorized  individuals  maintain  and  post  transactions  on  behalf  of  the accountable  officer.  The  accountable  officer  is  also  responsible  for  identifying  and  initiating corrective action for inaccurate accountable transactions upon discovery.   24 AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 4.5.  Control of Auditable and Accountable Documents. 4.5.1.  Auditable documents are identified in paragraph 5.4.1.  Accountable documents are identified in paragraph 5.4.2. of this Instruction. 4.5.2.  Each accountable document is assigned a distinct number to identify it.  Accountable documents are numbered consecutively using document control registers or control logs, in a manner that permits easy identification of lost or missing documents.  Auditable documents need not be logged or numbered, but for audit purposes, require to be filed so that they can be easily  retrieved  and  establish  an  audit  trail.    The  MASO  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the accuracy of document registers and control logs, and ensuring all documents are maintained on file, as required.  (T-1). 4.5.3.  Signatures  are  only  those  of  authorized  individuals.    The  MASO  will  ensure  all signatures are original (faxed copies of originals, digitally scanned copies, or carbon copies are  acceptable)  and  will  be  written  in  ink  (black  or  blue-black).    (T-1).    For  automated systems using password controlled User-Ids, equivalent electronic signatures are acceptable.  If  an  automated  document  has  a  signature  block  that  is  not  electronically  populated,  the document is printed and signed. 4.5.3.1.  The  MASO  must  ensure  accountable  documentation  is  legible,  accurate  and auditable.    (T-1).    For  hard  copy  discrepancies  that  cannot  be  corrected,  the  MASO  or designated personnel lines through and initials next to the discrepancy.  For discrepancies affecting  the  stock  record  account,  the  MASO  provides  a  detailed  explanation  of  each discrepancy  by  memorandum  of  record.    (T-1).    For  minor  errors  and  typos,  a memorandum  is  not  required.    A  signature  by  the  Receiving      Element      of      the   Deployment   and Distribution Flight,  LRS (or equivalent) is not required when using a commercial  carrier.  The  MASO  shall    retain  the  carrier's  receipt  with  the  accountable documents (e.g., staple the commercial receipt to the unsigned DD Form 1348-1A).  (T-1). 4.5.4.  The MASO will ensure accountable documents are filed in document control, signed  and  dated,  and  reviewed  for  accuracy  by  authorized  individuals  prior  to  filing.    Auditable documents do not need to be QC’d.  The MASO implements the following: 4.5.4.1.  QC  all  accountable  documents  and  NUREPs  prior  to  transmission.    (T-1).    Do not delay performing QC check, report transmission, posting or filing because the MASO is not available. Upon return, the MASO will QC all accountable documents, which took place during their absence.  (T-2). 4.5.4.2.  Use a QC guide for each accountable document prior to filing.  Prepare guides to address all applicable requirements. 4.5.4.3.  QC  reviewer  cannot  be  the  person  who  generated  the  accountable  document.  (T-1). 4.5.5.  The  MASO  will  control  all  original  documents  and  file  them  in  the  account’s document  control  files.    (T-1).    Access  to  document  control  files  is  limited  to  individuals appointed IAW paragraph 2.2.4.25.  (T-1).  If an original document is lost or destroyed, the MASO  obtains  a  copy  of  the  original  document  (e.g.,  suspense  copy),  reviews  it  to  ensure accuracy and certifies its accuracy with a statement of certification and their signature.  The AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 25 MASO will control the certified true copy in the same manner as an original document.  (T-1). 4.6.  Consumption  and  Custody  Accounting.  Issued  items  are  accounted  for  using  either consumption or custody accounting procedures. 4.6.1.  Consumption items are typically low cost, non-reparable and non-sensitive items (e.g., Group  X  Kits,  small  hardware,  gaskets,  nuts,  bolts,  screws,  washers,  grease)  that  are considered expendable. However, there are some DOE Spares Repair Listing (DSRL) items that are consumed into the next higher assembly (e.g., MC1828, CF2438, bomb fin, CF2437, etc.).    These  items  are  considered  "consumed"  and  are  dropped  from  accountable  records when issued to authorized personnel. 4.6.2.  Custody items that are reparable items (e.g., DSRL) must be continually accounted for until  returned  to  the  vendor,  properly  disposed  of  IAW  authorized  disposition  instructions and pertinent disposal directives other than items which are to be consumption issued IAW paragraph 3.6.1. Accountable Officers are not required to custody issue items to personnel within  their  unit.  The  appropriate  commander  designates  a  repairable  item  custodian responsible  for  the  items  issued  to  the  unit  until  turned-in  or  expended  (in  the  case  of  test items  expended  during  SFT  or  other  Operational  Test  and  Evaluation  (OT&E).    The custodian keeps records showing items in his or her custody.  These records include a spare SE  custody  listing  from  the  last  time  the  items  were  inventoried,  and  copies  of  any documents  affecting  items  in  his  or  her  custody  that  document  transactions  occurring  since the last validation.  Items are maintained on the accountable officer’s records and posted to stock records as “In-Use” balances.  (T-1). 4.7.  Stock Records and Control of Stock Records.  Account stock records reflect current and historical balances of items on the account when an inventory line is applied.  Balances change because of transactions posted to the account.  MASOs should consider DIAMONDS restrictions when verifying stock record balances against actual on-hand balances. 4.7.1.  Base and Military Spares are accounted for by part number but may also be accounted for by National Stock Number (NSN).  A complete set of stock records consists of a separate stock  record  for  each  part  number  or  NSN  for  which  transactions  have  been  posted.    The stock record either is automated or is a manual card for items not accounted for as part of an automated system. 4.8.  Inventories.  Periodic  inventories  ensure  account  balances  and  item  configurations  are accurately  reflected  on  the  account.    For  the  SIR,  verification  by  an  independent  inventory-verifying officer is required by DoD regulations for TO 11N-100-3150 reportable items.  (T-0).  Any time a new MASO is appointed, a 100% inventory ensures all accountable items are present prior  to  the  new  MASO  assuming  custodial  responsibility  for  the  items.    Periodic  spot-check inventories  help  ensure  accuracy  of  account  records  between  100%  inventories.    HAF, MAJCOM, NCP or the MASO may direct special inventories to ensure specific items are present and properly accounted for on account records. 4.9.  Audit Trails and Audits. 4.9.1.  Audit trail.  While a specific audit trail for each transaction varies by transaction type, there are general requirements that constitute an adequate audit trail.  The audit trail begins with  letters of authorization.   These letters, signed by  appropriate approving officials,  IAW 26 AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 governing  directives,  provide  the  authorization  for  individuals  to  request  and  or  receipt  for property,  report  accountable  transactions  to  the  MASO,  and  maintain  account  records  on behalf  of  the  MASO.    The  audit  trail  continues  with  documents  reporting  accountable transactions  to  the  MASO  and  source  documents  (e.g.  receipt,  shipping,  issue,  and  turn-in documents, inventory adjustment vouchers and Stock Change Vouchers (SCVs)) supporting the  transactions  themselves.    Control  these  documents  using  document  registers  or  control logs  and  numbered  sequentially  so  that  any  missing  documents  are  easily  recognized.    The audit  trail  includes  proper  preparation  of  these  documents  using  approved  procedures  and signatures  (when  required)  of  approved  individuals.    Account  stock  records  then  tie  the supporting  documents  to  changes  in  account  balances  reflected  on  individual  lines  of  the stock  records.    The  audit  trail  continues  with  periodic  inventories  that  demonstrate  the accuracy  of  account  balances  compared  to  physical  identification  and  counts  of  property.  The audit trail also includes Certificates of Transfer of Accountability that contain beginning and ending transaction document numbers showing an unbroken chain between MASOs over time. 4.9.2.  Periodic audits provide an independent assessment of account records to ensure proper accountability is maintained, an accurate audit trail exists and proper accounting procedures are being followed.  Audits are performed either by an outside agency or by a verifying/audit officer  appointed  on  orders  to  perform  the  audit.    The  audit  consists  of  reviewing  a representative (at a minimum of 20 percent) of accountable records to determine if approved accounting procedures are being followed and to assess the accuracy of accountable records and completeness of the audit trail.  If inaccuracies or irregularities are discovered, or where an adequate audit trail does not exist, the sample is increased to determine the extent of the inaccuracy or irregularity.  A 100% audit may be performed if the auditor deems it necessary, or when directed by local authorities or higher headquarters to reestablish accountability.    In general, an audit provides assurance that: 4.9.2.1.  The  MASO  has  been  duly  appointed  and  meets  qualifications  required  by pertinent directives. 4.9.2.2.  A  review  of  Certificates  of  Transfer  of  Accountability  indicates  an  unbroken chain of accountability between MASOs. 4.9.2.3.  Proper  periodic  inventories  are  being  conducted  as  required  and  that  stock records reflect accurate balances as of the latest 100% inventory. 4.9.2.4.  Personnel properly authorized to maintain the account are posting transactions to account  records  as  transactions  occur  and  that  personnel  are  knowledgeable  of  required procedures. 4.9.2.5.  Required reports are submitted in accordance with directive timelines. 4.9.2.6.  Transactions  posted  to  accountable  records  are  adequately  supported  by  source documents that are properly prepared IAW appropriate directives, and that only properly supported transactions are posted to account records. 4.9.2.7.  A  review  of  document  registers,  document  control  logs  and  documents  on  file indicate that all original (or properly certified copies of original) accountable documents are on file. AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 27 4.9.2.8.  Personnel  who  receive  property  are  authorized  to  do  so  IAW  appropriate directives. 4.9.2.9.  An  adequate  audit  trail  exists  indicating  approved  accounting  procedures  are followed. 28 AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 Chapter 5 ACCOUNTING, ADMINISTRATION, AND MANAGEMENT OF NUCLEAR ACCOUNTS 5.1.  General.  These  procedures  apply  to  all  activities  directly  or  indirectly  involved  in  the nuclear weapons program and are for FK nuclear managed accounts.  These procedures provide supplementary Air Force guidance to TO 11N-100-1, Supply Management of Nuclear Weapons Materiel,  TO  11N-100-2,  Supply  Management  of  Limited  Life  Components,  TO  11N-100-4, Custody, Accountability, and Control of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Materiel, TO 11N-3150-8-1,  USAF  DIAMONDS  Policy  and  Procedures,  CJCSI  3150.04A,  Nuclear  Weapons  Stockpile Logistics Management and Nuclear  Weapons Reports under the Joint Reporting Structure, and TO 11N-100-3150, Joint Reporting Structure, Nuclear Weapons Reports. 5.2.

(supporting  documents listed in 5.4.2.4.5.  AF Form 504, Weapons Custody Transfer Document. 5.4.2.4.6.  Certificates of Transfer of Accountability. 5.5.  Document Control.  The MASO is responsible for all transactions processed by the NARS personnel.  The MASO will ensure the following procedures are used: 5.5.1.  Use  a  centralized  document  control  system.    (T-1).    The  MASO  will  ensure maintenance  of  two  document  registers,  one  for  on-base  transactions  (issues,  turn-ins  and SCVs) and the other for off-base transactions (requisitions, receipts and shipments).   (T-1).  Maintain these registers in DIAMONDS automated formats, where possible.  Use AF Form 36, Supply Document Register, if DIAMONDS is not available.  The MASO will ensure only authorized NARS account personnel make entries on these registers. 5.5.1.1.  On-base document numbers are formatted with a two-digit fiscal year and a four-digit  document  serial  number,  assigned  sequentially  by  fiscal  year  (e.g.,    05-0001,  05-0002, beginning 1 Oct 05.   Note:  Leading zeroes are included for DIAMONDS to sort the document numbers correctly). 5.5.1.2.  Off-base  documents  are  assigned  using  the  SRAN,  one-digit  calendar  year, followed by the Julian date and four-digit sequential document number for that calendar year (e.g., FK236541010254 for the 254th document assigned in 2014 which was issued on 11 April).  Note:  Leading zeroes for this sequence number must also be included for DIAMONDS to sort the document numbers correctly. 5.5.1.2.1.  When  an  item  requisitioned  by  the  unit  is  received,  NARS  will  use  the requisition number assigned from the Off-Base register at the time the requisition was made to account for the receipt. 5.5.1.2.2.  For items that are received without being requisitioned (i.e., force-shipped items, including weapons and components), see paragraph  4.9.2.1 5.5.1.2.3.  For  items  to  be  shipped,  assign  the  next  available  off-base  sequence number for each item P/N and destination. 5.6.  Stock Control.  MASOs must ensure appropriate stock levels are maintained.  (T-1).  Stock levels for the following type items are determined as indicated. 5.6.1.  DOE  Major  Assemblies,  Components,  Retrofit  Kits  and  Test  Items.    Established levels  do  not  exist  for  these  items.    They  are  force  shipped  to  units  based  on  stockpile allocations (see AFI  21-204,  Chapter 3), LLC replacement schedules, retrofit orders (RO), test plans and operational orders. AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 31 5.6.2.  WR  Containers  and  Bolsters.    Units  are  authorized  to  maintain  base  spares container/bolster for each WR and Type trainer.  All others are approved via USAL. 5.6.2.1.  (USAFE  units  only)  Units  maintain  a  minimum  of  one  serviceable  bolster  or container  and  an  appropriate  number  of  serviceable  caster  sets  for  each  assigned  WR weapon.  Additionally,  units  are  authorized  suitable  bolsters/containers  to  transport assigned Type 3 trainers. 5.6.3.  Military Spares.  In the event  units wish to maintain stock levels  for military spares, units will utilize the USAL process as outlined in this Instruction and TO 11N-100-1. 5.6.4.  Base Spares.  Base Spare stock levels  are  authorized by  approval  of the  USAL.  The USAL  shows  DOE  part  number,  noun,  reorder  point  and  maximum  quantity  authorized.  Units will report quantities that exceed the maximum authorized as excess  IAW procedures in paragraph 5.7. of this Instruction.  (T-1).  For determining quantities authorized on hand, a higher number suffix of a part number may be counted against the level of a lower suffix part number, as long as the basic part number is the same. 5.6.4.1.  USAL  development,  coordination,  annual  USAL  inventory  and  approval procedures  are  located  in  TO  11N-100-1,  Supply  Management  of  Nuclear  Weapons Materiel.    Units  will  reconcile  their  USAL  against  the  BMSS  NLT  30  days  after  final levels are approved.  (T-1). 5.7.  Excess  Item  Reporting  and  Disposition  of  Assets.  Units  will  request  disposition  of serviceable items  in  excess  of authorized level  or unserviceable items  for which no disposition instructions have been provided or for which disposition is unclear (this does not pertain to XB3 items).    (T-1).    NCP  will  receive/document  all  disposition  requests  in  Nuclear  Munitions Command and Control (NMC2).  (T-2). 5.7.1.  Excess Serviceable Base Spares. NCP must report excess serviceable military spares.  NSC furnishes disposition for these items.   For items  returned to  NSC, ensure the Material Return  Authorization  (MRA)  number  provided  with  disposition  instructions  is  clearly marked  as  shown  in  the  address.    (T-2).    If  no  MRA  number  is  provided,  contact  NSC Program Management personnel for further guidance.  (T-2). 5.7.2.  Excess  Serviceable Military Spares.  Unit  must report all excess  serviceable military Spares IAW TO 11N-100-1.  (T-0). 5.7.3.  Unserviceable  Reparable  Items.    The  DSRL  provides  disposition  for  reparable  Base Spares,  Military  Spares  and  DOE  SE.    Return  these  items  to  the  facility  indicated  on  the DSRL for repair.  For items returned to NSC, units will refer to TO 11N-100-1.  (T-0). 5.7.4.  Unserviceable  Consumable  Items.    Except  for  Unsatisfactory  Report  (UR)  exhibits, dispose of these items IAW applicable technical data.  (T-0).  MASO/NARS will retain UR exhibits (unserviceable condition) on accountable record until receipt of UR disposition.  (T-1).  The MASO will ensure items are disposed of  IAW UR disposition instructions.   (T-0).  The MASO will ensure, if local disposition is authorized, a consumption issue is processed to Maintenance for action.  (T-1).  The MASO will reference the UR number on all accountable documents (shipment, consumption issue, etc.).  (T-1). 5.7.5.  Excess  Limited  Life  Component,  Group-X  Kits  and  Retrofit  Kits.    Request  the disposition of these items from the NCP, as applicable.  (T-2). 32 AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 5.7.6.  The  MASO  will  ensure  USAL  items  with  expired  service  or  shelf  life  reflect  an unserviceable  condition.    (T-1).    If  items  can  be  used  for  training,  retain  on  record  until training  can  be  conducted.    (T-1).    The  MASO  will  ensure  if  items  cannot  be  used  for training, they are retained on record until disposition can be conducted.  (T-1).  The MASO will  ensure  expired  USAL  items  are  consumption  issued  to  Maintenance/training  for  either local disposal or training use.  (T-1). 5.8.  Requisitions. 5.8.1.  The  MASO  will  not  requisition  the  following  items,  unless  directed  to  do  so  by MAJCOM, UR or NCP: 5.8.1.1.  DOE Major Assemblies, LLC Kits, Group X Kits, and Test Items. 5.8.1.2.

The  MASO  must  ensure  Base  Spare  (BS)  and  Military  Spare  (MS)  items  in storage  are  not  co-mingled.    (T-1).    The  MASO  will  ensure  the  storage  bins  are conspicuously  marked.    "Base  Spare  Assets  Only"  and  "Military  Spare  Assets  Only"  to indicate  type  of  spares  authorized  for  storage  within  bin  rows  (not  applicable  for  large items such as bolsters and containers, etc.).  (T-3).  The MASO will ensure excess spares are segregated from other stock and identified as “excess.” Serviceable and unserviceable items will be segregated within the warehouse.  (T-3). 6.1.1.2.1.  To avoid  co-mingling stock,  and possibly using unapproved parts on WR end  items,  the  MASO  will  ensure  USAL  items  are  physically  segregated  (i.e., separate and clearly marked bin, area of the room) from non-USAL and USAL excess items, such as Air Force bench stock or other operating stock.  (T-2). 6.1.1.2.2.  The  MASO  will  prepare  bin  labels  or  serviceability  tags  for  each  non-reparable USAL item part number stored within the maintenance activity.  (T-3).  As a  minimum,  the  MASO  will    include  bin  number  or  location,  part  number, nomenclature, minimum (suggested re-order) quantity, and maximum quantity on the label or tag.  (T-3). 6.1.1.2.3.  NARS  personnel  will  perform  “walkthrough”  checks  of  bins  and  storage locations to determine if items need to be replenished.  (T-3).  NARS personnel will then requisition required items through Base and Military Spares Server (BMSS).  (T-3). 6.1.1.3.  Personnel will use DD Form 1574, Serviceable Tag - Materiel, DD Form 1575, Suspended Tag - Materiel, DD Form 1577, Unserviceable (Condemned) Tag - Materiel, to  identify  stored  property.    (T-1).    Personnel  will  mark  condition  tags  with  standard entries IAW AFI 23-101 and the designation BS or MS.  (T-1).  National stock numbers are not required.  Personnel will include the precautionary phrase from the stock list and the statement “ITEM CONTAINS TRAINING CATEGORY SOURCE AND SPECIAL (SS)  NUCLEAR  MATERIEL”  on  applicable  items.    (T-2).    For  all  classified components,  in  the  condition  tags  remarks  section,  Personnel  will  stamp  or  print “CLASSIFIED ITEM.”  (T-2). AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 41 6.1.1.4.  For  Group  X  kits  and  shelf  life  items,  personnel  will  establish  local  controls ensuring  items  are  stored  so  those  oldest  assets  are  issued  first.    (T-3).    Personnel  will ensure compliance with shelf life restrictions identified in specific item TOs.  (T-3). 6.1.2.  Storage  of  Assets  Temporarily  Issued  to  Maintenance,  or  on  Custody  Accounts.  When NARS issues items, the designated custodian or section chief must ensure items not in use are properly stored to preclude loss or damage. 6.1.3.  Storage  of  limited  life  components  and  nuclear  weapons  components  within Maintenance Activities. 6.1.3.1.  The  MASO  will  ensure  nuclear  components  are  stored  in  approved  containers under appropriate security.  (T-0). 6.1.3.2.  H1616/H1700  containers  may  be  stored  in  WS3s  containing  WR  weapons.  H1616/H1700  containers  may  be  pre-positioned  within  the  maintenance  facility  as  long as  the  MASO  ensures  the  criteria  in  DoD  S-5210.41M  and  AFMAN  31-108,  Nuclear Weapons Security Manuals, are met.  (T-0). 6.1.3.2.1.  Upon  receipt  of  H1616/H1700,  the  MASO  will  ensure  Department  of Transportation  (DOT)  expiration  dates  are  entered  into  NMC2.    H1616  and  H1700 container  serial  numbers,  DOT  expiration  dates,  and  content  condition    will    be  updated    in    the    NMC2    SharePoint    Environment    as    changes    occur.  NARS personnel  will  use  expiration  dates  to  ensure  assets  are  not  shipped  in  overdue containers beyond the military first destination.  (T-3). 6.2.  Seal Program.  AF/A4 designates service approved warhead container seals IAW TO 11N-100-3150, Joint Reporting Structure; Nuclear Weapons Reports. 6.2.1.  To preclude opening warhead containers without view ports, to verify contents during inventories,  other  than  SEV,  units  may  elect  to  seal  containerized  warheads  in  storage.    If units choose to seal containerized warheads, the provisions in paragraph 6.2, TO 11N-100-3150, and procedures listed below apply. 6.2.2.  Seals  may  be  issued  to  applicable  work  center  as  long  as  the  MASO  will  address control of seals in local procedures.  (T-3).  The MASO will maintain an accountable system to  identify  warhead  serial  number  and  associated  seal  serial  number(s)  installed  on  the container.    (T-1).    The  MASO  must  ensure  duplicate  serial  numbered  seals  are  not  issued and/or installed on containers.  (T-3). 6.2.3.  The MASO will utilize the worksheet contained in Figure 6.1 and maintain it with in the local files plan (see Figure 6.1)  (T-3).  The Maintenance technician and verifier will fill out this form and return to the MASO.  (T-3).  In turn, the MASO will utilize this worksheet to update the controlled electronic accountable system.  (T-3). 6.2.3.1.  The  MASO  will  ensure  the  worksheet  contains,  at  a  minimum,  the  following information:  (T-3). 6.2.3.1.1.  Nomenclature/Serial Number 6.2.3.1.2.

TO 11N-100-3150 reportable items are inventoried using procedures in TO 11N-100-3150 and this AFI.  The MASO will investigate out-of-balance conditions found during any inventory  to  determine  their  causes.    (T-2).    The  MASO  will  resolve  losses  and  document findings using the procedures in paragraph 7.8.  (T-1). 7.2.  Inventory Requirements. 7.2.1.  Change of MASO.  Each time a new MASO is assigned, gaining and losing MASO’s will conduct a 100% inventory of the account.  (T-1). 7.2.2.  Change  of  Custodian.    Each  time  a  new  Reparable  Item  custodian  is  assigned,  the gaining custodian must conduct a 100% inventory of items issued to their sub-account.  (T-2).    Custodians  will  report  any  unresolved  discrepancies  to  the  MASO  and  the  appropriate commander  to  initiate  a  Report  of  Survey  (or  other  appropriate  action)  prior  to  signing  the Spare SE Custody listing and assuming responsibility for the account.  (T-2). 7.2.3.  Monthly  10%  Spot  Check  Inventories.    NARS  monitors  will  conduct  monthly  10% spot check inventories (except SIR months) IAW paragraph 7.6.  (T-3). 7.2.4.  Semi-Annual Inventory.  The MASO and custodians will inventory TO 11N-100-3150 reportable  items  semi-annually.    (T-0).    The  MASO  and  custodians  will  adhere  to  the procedures  in  TO  11N-100-3150  along  with  procedures  in  this  AFI.    (T-0).    The  SIR procedure  creates  an  independent  inventory  that  reports  the  national  nuclear  weapon stockpile  by  serial  number  and  quantity  for  each  location.    The  MASO  will  prepare  and submit as outlined in TO 11N-100-3150.  (T-0).  The MASO will forward waiver request to change the SIR date to the NCP through the applicable MAJCOM.  (T-1). 7.2.4.1.  Inventory the following items in conjunction with the SIR: 7.2.4.1.1.  Base and Military Spares. 7.2.4.1.2.  DOE owned equipment items. the inventory 7.3.  Semi-annual Inventory Procedures.  Once initiated, the MASO and custodians will make the semi-annual inventory their only duty over all maintenance activities.  (T-3).  Situations may arise  during   Final approval/disapproval  for  TO  11N-00-3150  reportable  actions  rests  with  the  applicable commander.  The MASO is the inventory officer for the semi-annual inventory.  In the event the MASO is unavoidably absent (e.g., emergency leave), the MASO appointing authority appoints an  alternate  inventory  officer  in  writing.    The  replacement  officer  must  meet  the  minimum requirements for a MASO.  (T-3). reportable  actions. that  dictates the  need for 7.3.1.  Before the semiannual inventory required in TO 11N-100-3150, the inventory officer (MASO) will brief the verifying officer concerning his or her inventory responsibilities and all aspects of the inventory.  (T-2). 44 AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 7.3.2.  Immediately before or during the semiannual inventory of items in TO 11N-100-3150, maintenance  personnel  will  take  an  inventory  to  ensure  availability  of  pullout  cables  and other accessory items required for operational flexibility.  (T-2). 7.3.2.1.  These  items  are  identified  in  the  inspection  section  of  applicable  technical publications.  Cables and accessories are stored or attached to certain bombs in a package commonly referred to as a saddlebag. 7.3.2.2.  If  an  accessory  item  is  missing,  maintenance  personnel  will  consider  the  bomb operational unless it cannot be used to support the current mission.   (T-3).  The MASO will  thoroughly  research  shortages  to  locate  missing  items  and  determine  the  cause  of shortages.  (T-3). 7.3.2.3.  The MASO will establish controls to prevent recurrence and report.  (T-2).  The MASO will promptly submit requisitions for replacement items to NSC.  (T-2). 7.3.2.4.  The MASO will ensure saddlebags are retained and all items are inventoried for applicable weapons.  (T-3).  He or she also will ensure a letter certifying the inventory is retained until the next saddlebag inventory certification is received.   (T-3).  Submission of  the  SIR  report  certifies  that  this  inventory  has  been  accomplished.    There  is  no additional  requirement  for  reporting  or  recording  the  inventory  of  pullout  cables  and other accessory items.   Note: Saddlebags with  enclosed contents may be removed from weapons,  inventoried  and  placed  inside  sealed  container(s)  (e.g.,  banded  wooden  crate) for long-term storage.  Subsequent inventories will consist of verifying container content label and seal integrity. 7.3.3.  The  SIR  requires  a  visual  inventory  of  each  TO  11N-100-3150  reportable  item (including any trainers containing DOE SS nuclear materiel) by serial number.  Prepare and submit  as  outlined  in  TO  11N-100-3150.    (T-0).    The  576th  Flight  Test  Squadron  at Vandenberg AFB is required to accomplish a SIR when OMAs or other reportable items are assigned.  (T-2).  When no reportable items are assigned, the 576th Flight Test Squadron will send a negative reply to the NCP and DTRA addresses in TO 11N-100-3150.  (T-2). 7.3.3.1.  H1616/H1700 and other component shipping containers do not require opening for inventory purposes. 7.3.3.2.  The MASO must ensure that warhead containers that are not sealed are opened to verify contents using guidelines in TO 11N-100-3150.  (T-0). 7.3.3.3.  Warheads  stored  in  containers  previously  opened,  inspected,  and  sealed  by  the accountable  organization  do  not  require  reopening  during  semiannual  inventories provided  information  obtained  from  the  exterior  of  the  container  and  the  seal/serial number list maintained by the MASO match. 7.3.3.3.1.  If  a  conflict  in  the  information  on  the  exterior  of  the  container  and  the seal/serial number listing is identified, open the container and verify contents. 7.3.3.3.2.  When  performing  inventories,  or  as  directed  by  TO  11N-100-3150, personnel will perform the following seal inspection procedures: 7.3.3.3.2.1.  Visually inspect wire rope and locking device for signs of tampering.  If tampering is detected, immediately notify MASO.  (T-0). AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 45 7.3.3.3.2.2.  Firmly  grasp  seal  and  give  a  firm  tug  to  ensure  seal  is  firmly installed,  if  seal  contains  a  wire  rope  ensure  it  is  fully  inserted  and  the  locking device is properly functioning.  If seal can be removed, notify MASO.  (T-0). 7.3.3.3.2.3.  If  tampering  is  detected  or  the  seal  can  be  removed,  notify  MASO.  (T-0). 7.3.3.3.2.4.  During the inventory, if the container was sealed IAW procedures in Chapter 6 and TO 11N-100-3150, record the warhead serial number stenciled on the  container  and  the  seal  number(s)  on  the  blind  inventory  worksheet.    (T-1).  During inventory reconciliation, the MASO will compare the serial number of the containerized  warheads  and  associated  seals  recorded  on  the  blind  inventory worksheet against the MASO’s accountable documents.  (T-1). 7.3.3.3.2.5.  In  the  event  the  seal/warhead  serial  number  does  not  match accountable  records  or  seals  are  not  installed,  or  show  signs  of  tampering,  the container must be opened to physically verify warhead serial number.  (T-0). 7.3.3.4.  In  the  event  a  container  must  be  opened  for  any  reason  and  if  the  etched, engraved  or  stamped  permanent  serial  number  cannot  be  verified  without  removing  the warhead from the container, but  a stenciled serial number is visible, compare this serial number  with  accountable  records.    (T-0).    If  no  markings  are  visible,  the  item  must  be removed from the container to verify serial number.  (T-0). 7.3.4.  SIR  Record  Verification.    After  the  blind  inventory  is  complete,  and  prior  to transmission  of  the  SIR  message,  the  MASO  will  verify  serial  numbers  on  the  following documents.  (T-1): 7.3.4.1.  Blind inventory worksheets (manual or electronic). 7.3.4.1.1.  At  the  beginning  of  the  inventory,  the  worksheet  is  blank  except  for column  headings  (e.g.,  serial  number  and  any  other  information  the  MASO  deems relevant).  (T-1). 7.3.4.1.2.  As the inventory is conducted, information pertaining to the specific items found during the inventory is added to the worksheet as each item is visually verified. Adjustments  to  the  blind  inventory  worksheet  are  not  authorized  after  the  visual verification has been accomplished.  (T-1). 7.3.4.1.3.  Assign blind count-sheet page numbers (1 of 8, etc.).  (T-1). 7.3.4.1.4.  Blind inventory sheets used during the SIR must be printed and signed by both the inventory and verifying officer.  (T-1). 7.3.4.2.  Inventory count cards. 7.3.4.3.  Printed copy of the SIR message. 7.3.4.4.  Location Inventory Listing (as currently annotated by the NARS section). 7.3.4.5.  Balances on Stock Records.   46 AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 7.3.5.  The MASO will ensure the SIR and an Inventory Verification Certificate as outlined in TO 11N-100-3150 are prepared and submitted.  (T-0). 7.3.6.  The MASO will validate all reports for errors and submit corrections as  needed.  (T-0).    Both  inventory  and  verifying  officer  will  review  and  sign  the  SIR  message  prior  to transmission.  (T-0). 7.3.7.  SIR  Reconciliation.    After  the  SIR  is  transmitted,  DTRA  reconciles  each  unit’s  SIR report against the DIAMONDS database.  If SIR errors exist, DTRA notifies the NCP who, in turn, notifies the applicable MAJCOM as required.  The unit will resolve the discrepancy and submit a corrected report IAW TO 11N-100-3150.  (T-0).  If no errors exist, or once any errors  have  been  corrected,  DTRA  transmits  a  SIR  reconciliation  message.    This  message confirms  to  the  unit  and  the  applicable  MAJCOM  that  the  unit’s  records  agree  with  the DIAMONDS database as of the SIR date. 7.3.7.1.  Units  will  maintain  the  following  according  to  Table  7.1  and  the  AF  RDS  in AFRIMS  (T-1): 7.3.7.1.1.  Certificate of Inventory. 7.3.7.1.2.

(T-0).    The  MASOs  will  complete  a Certificate  of  Transfer  of  Accountability  IAW  TO  11N-100-4.    (T-0).    The  MASOs  will include  both  Base  Document  Register  and  Requisition  and  Shipping  Document  Register numbers on the certificate.  (T-0). 7.4.1.1.  Semiannual  inventories  may  also  be  used  to  suffice  for  the  requirement  for  a change of MASO provided both gaining and losing MASOs participate in the inventory along with the verifying/audit officer. 7.4.1.2.  No transactions affecting stock record balances occur between the effective date of the inventory and the effective date of the transfer of accountability. 7.4.2.  For inventories that are not conducted in conjunction with a SIR, the MASOs will use the same procedures as a semi-annual inventory except (T-0): 7.4.2.1.  Do  not  appoint  a  verifying/audit  officer.    The  gaining  MASO  is  the  inventory officer and the losing MASO is the verifying officer. 7.4.2.2.  Do not submit a SIR, and do not prepare an Inventory Verification Certificate. 7.5.  Special Inventories. 7.5.1.  SEV.  The SEV is a rapid inventory to verify all or selected portions of the stockpile of  nuclear  weapons  in  the  possession  of  authorized  agents.    Prepare  and  submit  reports  as outlined  in  TO  11N-100-3150.    (T-0).    SLAs  and  DTRA  reconcile  SEV  reports  from responsible organizations and provide SEV status reports to the Joint Staff according to TO 11N-100-3150  until  the  SEV  is  terminated.    Note:    MASOs  must  open  containerized weapons  within  the  scope  of  the  SEV  to  verify  contents  regardless  of  whether  or  not  they were previously sealed by the unit.  (T-0). 48 AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 7.6.  Monthly  Spot  Check  Inventories.  This  inventory  does  not  apply  to  TO  11N-100-3150 reportable  items.    Each  month  (except  for  SIR  months)  units  will  select  for  inventory  at  least 10%  of  the  part  numbers  with  current  balances  on  the  account.    (T-3).    The  MASO  will inventory  by  quantity  and  location,  and  reconcile  against  account  stock  records  for  those  part numbers.    (T-3).    The  MASO  will  resolve  any  discrepancies  and  report  any  irresolvable discrepancies  to  the  squadron  commander  to  initiate  a  Report  of  Survey  or  other  appropriate action.    (T-3).    The  MASO  will  ensure  monthly  spot-check  inventories  are  posted  in DIAMONDS.  (T-2). 7.7.  Inventory  Documentation.  Note:  For  trainers  containing  DOE  SS  nuclear  material, MASO must inventory during the SIR for TO 11N-100-3150 reporting purposes only.  (T-0). 7.7.1.  Inventory Count Cards. 7.7.1.1.  The  MASO  will  prepare  DIAMONDS  generated  inventory  count  cards  for  TO 11N-100-3150  reportable  items.    (T-2).    The  MASO  will  not  prepare  Inventory  Count Cards for items on custody accounts of Reparable Item Custodians or items on the USAL (T-3); Custody Validation Listings are used for Reparable Item Custodian Inventories. 7.7.1.1.1.  For monthly spot check inventories, the MASO will update inventory dates for  each  part  number  IAW  TO  11N-3150-8-1  (T-0).    The  MASO  will  prepare  a separate card for serviceable and unserviceable items of the same part number.  (T-2).  If  the  information  on  any  card  is  classified,  then  the  MASO  will  classify  the  card IAW  the  applicable  classification  guide.    (T-0).    The  MASO  will  not  include nomenclature  if  doing  so  would  classify  the  form.    (T-3).    The  MASO  will  prepare the card as follows (T-0): 7.7.1.1.2.

Audits of Accounts.  The term "audited" as it applies to these procedures denotes a formal quantitative audit of a specific account (i.e.  SRAN) for verifying its records (see paragraph 4.9. for a general discussion of audits and audit trails). 7.9.1.  Types of Audits. 7.9.1.1.  Semi-Annual Audit of Account (normally accomplished in conjunction with the SIR).    Personnel  designated  on  orders  by  the  commander,  perform  this  audit  in conjunction  with  each  semi-annual  inventory.    The  audit  ensures  all  TO  11N-100-3150 reportable nuclear weapons and components are accounted  for, properly  controlled, and signed  for,  when  required,  during  the  weapon  custody  transfer  process,  and  provides  a reasonable  assurance  that  the  accountable  officer  is  following  proper  accounting procedures.    The  audit  encompasses  all  accountable  records  listed  in  paragraph  5.4.  Conduct the audit IAW below procedures. 7.9.1.2.  Special  Audits.    In  addition  to  the  semi-annual  audit  of  account,  the  Air  Force Audit  Agency,  higher  headquarters,  or  a  government  agency,  such  as  the  Government Accounting  Office,  may  direct  a  special  audit.    For  special  audits,  the  agency  directing the audit determines its scope. 7.9.2.  Appointing the Audit Officer.  The wing commander will designate an audit/verifying officer  in  writing.    (T-1).    The  Wing  Commander  will  make  the  appointment  on  special orders  issued  by  the  commander’s  order  issuing  authority.    (T-1).    The  Wing  Commander will  specify  on  the  orders  that  the  appointment  is  made  on  behalf  of  the  MAJCOM commander IAW this AFI.  (T-1).  A disinterested individual will not be designated as audit officer for two consecutive SIRs.  (T-1). 7.9.3.  Briefing the Audit Officer.  The MASO will brief the audit officer, who conducts the audit IAW procedures in this AFI, using as a guide the checklist in Table 7.5  (T-1).  Prior to the  start  of  the  audit,  NARS  personnel  will  review  the  checklist  with  the  audit  officer, provide  examples  of  documents  to  illustrate  items  shown  in  the  checklist  and  answer  any questions the audit officer may have concerning the requirements of the audit.  (T-1). 7.9.4.  For  procedures  below,  a  representative  sample  is  considered  at  least  20%  of documents  created  since  the  last  audit.    If  discrepancies  are  discovered,  the  audit  officer should  increase  the  sample  size  to  determine  if  any  errors  are  widespread  or  systemic  in nature.    The  audit  officer  should  make  recommendations  for  corrective  action  in  the  audit report. 52 AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 7.9.5.  Performing the Audit.  The Audit Officer must: 7.9.5.1.  Review  the  previous  audit  report.    (T-0).    During  the  audit,  place  special emphasis on ensuring that all previously noted discrepancies were corrected. 7.9.5.2.  MAR  review will be conducted  IAW  Table  7.2   (T-0).   Note:    A MAR  log is not required because it does not contain a unique identification number. 7.9.5.3.  Review a representative sample of MARs and associated NUREPs created since the last audit. (T-0).  The Audit Officer will ensure all actions reported to the MASO that require  NUREP  reporting  have  been  reported  accurately  and  within  prescribed timeframes.    (T-0).    Note:  If  the  unit  discovered,  or  was  notified  of,  NUREP  reporting errors, these errors should not be considered as errors existing on the account at the time of  the  audit,  provided  correction  NUREP  reports  were  submitted  within  required timeframes. 7.9.5.4.  Review  both  document  registers  and  inventory  all  documents  created  since  the last  audit  to  ensure  all  documents  are  on  file.    (T-0).    For  forced  receipts,  the  Audit Officer will ensure the shipper’s document number is cross-referenced in the “Remarks” column of the register.    (T-0).   The  Audit  Officer will ensure  all documents  on file  are either  original  documents  or  MASO-certified  true  copies  of  original  documents.    (T-0).  Identify to the audit officer which document register entries are applicable to this audit.  (T-0). 7.9.5.5.

The  Audit  Officer  will verify  the  weapons  serial  number  against  the  receiving  data  record  and  custody  issue documents.    (T-0).    The  Audit  Officer  will  ensure  documents  were  properly  prepared, only  authorized  personnel  signed  for  the  items  on  the  documents,  and  that  balance changes  were  properly  posted  to  stock  records.    (T-0).    The  Audit  Officer  will  ensure associated  weapon  container  and  bolster  part  numbers  and  quantities  are  shown  on weapon receipt and shipping documents and that the document number for the end item is used to  post balance changes to  container and bolster stock records.   (T-0).   Identify to the audit officer which document register entries are applicable to this audit.  (T-0). 7.9.5.6.  Review a representative sample of all other documents shown in either On Base or Off Base document registers.   (T-0).  The Audit Officer will ensure documents were properly  prepared,  processed  and  posted  to  stock  records.    (T-0).    Identify  to  the  audit officer which document register entries are applicable to this audit.  (T-0). 7.9.5.7.  Review 100% of the custody transfer documents maintained by the MASO.  (T-0).  For all weapon/warhead movements since the last audit, the Audit Officer will ensure the control numbers on the custody transfer documents are sequentially logged in on the custody  transfer  document  control  registers.    (T-0).    The  Audit  Officer  will  ensure  that only authorized personnel receipt for weapons/warheads using the procedures in Chapter 8 of this AFI.  (T-0). 7.9.6.  Audit Documentation.

General Requirements. 8.1.1.  Wing  commanders  designate  units  whose  commanders  may  appoint  individuals authorized  to  receive  custody  of  nuclear  weapons  and  nuclear  warheads  during  operational movements (see sample letter in Figure 8.1) IAW Chapter 8 of this Instruction. ictect(T-1).  Wing  commanders  will  appoint  PRP  certified  personnel  to  receipt  for  classified  DOE  end items, components and documents during logistics movements (sample in  Figure 2.1).   (T-0). 8.1.2.  Unit commanders (Group or Squadron) will appoint individuals authorized to receive custody of nuclear weapons and nuclear warheads during operational movements (sample in Figure  8.2).    (T-1).    Appointed  individuals  must  be  U.S.  Military  (regular  or  reserve component) or DoD civilians certified on PRP, with an appropriate security clearance.  (T-1).  Air  National  Guard  and  Air  Force  Reserve  members  may  be  appointed,  but  are  only permitted  to  accept  custody  when  they  are  in  Title  10  status.    (T-1).    In  addition  to appointment  letters,  the  following  methods  may  be  used  to  appoint/verify  individuals  to receive custody of nuclear weapons during operational movements: 8.1.2.1.  An  AAAL  may  be  used  to  identify  personnel  authorized  to  receive  custody  of nuclear weapons and nuclear warheads inside maintenance and storage areas. 8.1.2.2.  A  Missile  Alert  Duty  Order  (MADO)  may  be  used  to  identify  Missile  Combat Crews (MCC) authorized to receive custody of RSs at launch facilities (LF) regardless of which Launch Control Center (LCC) an MCC is assigned and in lieu of an appointment letter specifically listing MCCs. 8.1.2.3.  Individuals granted unescorted entry to ICBM LFs or LCCs through the Missile Entry Control System, are authorized recipients and will use a valid entry authentication using Missile Electronic Encryption Device.  (T-3). 8.1.2.4.  An  open  area  on  a  line  badge  may  be  used  to  identify  personnel  inside maintenance,  storage  and  flightline  areas  authorized  to  receive  custody  of  nuclear weapons and nuclear warheads during operational movements. 8.1.2.5.  As  a  minimum,  units  must  issue  appointment  letters  and  AAAL  that  include name, grade (Officer or Enlisted), security clearance and PRP status.  (T-2).  The MASO will distribute applicable documentation to facilitate transfer of, movement of and access to nuclear weapons and nuclear components.  (T-3). 8.1.2.6.  Deploying  units  must  send  both  their  current  signed  wing  commander’s  unit designation  letter  and  a  unit  commander  appointment  letter  to  the  wing  commander, squadron commander, and MASO at  the deployed location prior to  their arrival.   (T-2).  These letters are used to ensure deployed personnel are authorized to receive custody of nuclear weapons during operational movements. AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 57 8.1.3.  Continuous  US  custody  of  nuclear  weapons  is  mandatory  until  receipt  of  a  valid nuclear  control  order  that  permits  transferring  US  nuclear  weapons  to  non-US  delivery forces. 8.2.  Custody  Transfer  Procedures.  If  a  custody  transfer  is  necessary  during  an  operational movement,  the  individual  relinquishing  custody  of  nuclear  weapons  and  nuclear  warheads  will ensure the individual receiving custody is an authorized recipient prior to custody transfer.   (T-0).  Individuals gaining custody will conduct visual serial number(s) against the source document (i.e., AF Form 504) except when not required in the situation specific procedures.  (T-1). 8.2.1.  The  custodian  may  temporarily  depart  the  exclusion  area;  however,  if  the  custodian departs  the  area  permanently  an  authorized  custodian  will  conduct  visual  serial  number verification against the source document and sign the custody document.  (T-3). 8.2.2.  Guard  and  Reserve  personnel  must  know  and  validate  their  status  prior  to  accepting custody.  (T-2).  No additional procedures are required to independently verify statuses, but local custody transfer training should address guard and reserve status (as applicable). 8.3.  Custody  Transfer  Documentation.  The  custodian  must  create  AF  Form  504,  “Weapons Custody Transfer Document”, for movements identified in paragraph 8.5. (T-1).  AF Forms 504 are  not  required  for  logistics  movements  or  authorized  maintenance  and  handling  functions remaining  within  maintenance,  storage  and  vault  storage  areas,  including  between  separate vaults.  Upon completion of operational movements, the custodian must return signed copies of the AF Form 504 to the MASO. (T-1).  The MASO will maintain copy 1 for audit purposes; all others  will  be  destroyed.    (T-1).    The  MASO  or  designated  representative  may  authorize corrections  to  the  AF  Form  504.    The  MASO  or  designated  representative  will  line  through, initial the error and make a clear entry of the correct information.  (T-2).  Pen and ink changes to block 2 of the AF Form 504 are not authorized unless otherwise indicated in this Instruction. 8.3.1.  Sequence  of  custody  transfer  actions  are  presented  in  a  logical  flow.    However, sequence may be modified as necessary to allow for unique situations as long as authorized custodians  are  always  in  possession  of  assets.    Examples  include,  the  MASO  signing weapons  over  to  bay  chiefs  at  storage  structures  during  generations  when  tow  teams  are delayed,  the  MASO  signing  weapons  directly  over  to  ICBM  transport  crews  within maintenance facilities, etc. 8.4.  Logistics movements. 8.4.1.  The MASO will ensure a DD Form 1911, Materiel Courier Receipt, is used to transfer custody  to  or  from  Air  Mobility  Command  aircrews  or  Office  of  Secure  Transportation personnel.  (T-0). 8.4.2.  For  inbound  shipments,  the  MASO  will  perform  a  visual  verification  as  soon  as practical  to  ensure  the information  on the DD Form 1911 matches the serial number of the assets being received.  (T-0). 8.4.3.  For  outbound  shipments,  the  MASO  will  enter  the  structure  or  maintenance  facility and  perform  a  visual  verification  to  ensure  the  information  on  the  DD  Form  1911  matches the serial number of the assets being shipped.  (T-0).   58 AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 8.5.  Operational Movements. 8.5.1.  Transfer  of  Nuclear  ICBM  RS  to  LF.    The  MASO  will  prepare  AF  Form  504  IAW sample in Figure 8.3  (T-1). 8.5.1.1.  The  MASO  will  verify  the  RS  configuration  using  the  Stockpile  Location Planning Report (SLPR) and prepares two copies of the AF Form 504 (copy 1 is original, copy 2 is suspense) based on mission tasking, completes the “Transferred From” block 6, columns A through E on the forms, and gives the forms to the gaining MUNS custodian responsible  for  subsequently  transferring  custody.    (T-1).    The  MASO  will  establish  a control  number  for  the  document  by  annotating  the  control  register  using  an  AF  Form 3126.    (T-1).    The  MASO  will  annotate  the  control  number  in  block  1  and  RS  serial number  in  block  4  of  the  AF  Form  504.    (T-1).    In  the  event  the  current  AF  Form  504 becomes lost or illegible, the MASO will verify information and use copy 2 as the current AF Form 504.  (T-1). 8.5.1.2.  The  MUNS  custodian  will  perform  a  visual  verification  to  ensure  the information on the AF Form 504 matches the serial number of the RS being transferred.  (T-2). The MUNS custodian will complete the first “Transferred To” block 6, columns A through E on the forms.  (T-2). 8.5.1.3.  The  transfer/transport  custodian  and  MUNS  custodian  will  perform  a  visual verification to ensure the information on the AF Form 504 matches the serial number of the  RS.    (T-2).  The  transfer/transport  custodian  completes  the  next  “Transferred  To” block 6, columns A through E on both AF Forms 504 (copies 1 and 2) and validates the RS  system  serial  number  off  their  IMDS  work  order  or  other  source  document.

Prior  to  uploading  the  weapon,  the  load  monitor  will  accept  custody  by verifying the information on copy 1 and 2 of the AF Form 504 matches the serial number of  the  weapon  in  storage  and  completes  the  first  “Transferred  To”  block  6,  columns  A through  E  on  both  copies.    (T-2).    After  upload  of  the  weapon,  the  load  monitor  will annotate the aircraft tail number in block 5 on both copies of the AF Form 504 and copy 1 will remain with the loaded aircraft until the weapon is downloaded.  (T-2).  The load monitor  will  notify  munitions  control  to  annotate  the  aircraft  tail  number  in  block  5  on copy 3 of the AF Form 504 held in suspense.  (T-2).  The Load Monitor will return Copy 2 to the MASO.  (T-2). 8.5.10.4.  Upon  notification  that  the  aircraft  has  been  placed  on  alert,  the  AF  Form  504 process is suspended. 8.5.10.5.  For  weapon  swaps,  the  MASO  must  post  changes  and  cross-reference  the applicable AF Forms 504 to the originals.  (T-2). 8.5.10.6.  Upon  successful  release,  the  MASO  will  annotate  “Weapon  properly  released to host nation aircrew IAW EAM DTG # XX XXXX XXX XX” in the next “Transferred To” block of copy 2 of the AF Form 504.  (T-2).  The MASO keeps this copy in active suspense until the weapon is expended or returned to storage.  Weapons Maintenance will prepare a MAR to reflect appropriate status of the weapons and forward it to the MASO (paragraph 9.1.1).  (T-2). 8.5.11.  (OCONUS)  Downloading  and  Transferring  weapons  from  Non-US  Aircraft.  Downloading  and  returning  weapons  to  the  vault  is  the  reverse  of  the  upload  procedure.  Prior to downloading, the load monitor will obtain copy 1 of the AF Form 504 and verify the information  on the AF Form 504 matches the serial number of the weapon and aircraft tail number, and complete the first “Transferred To” block 6, columns A through E.  (T-2).  The load monitor will transfer custody using procedures for the rest of the download that are the reverse  of  weapon  upload.    (T-2).    The  load  monitor  will  transfer  custody  to  authorized individuals  as  necessary  until  weapon  is  returned  to  the  weapon  storage  vault.    (T-2).    The MASO must regain custody prior to closing and locking the vault.  (T-2).   66 AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 Figure 8.1.

Nuclear Weapons Accountability Reports. 9.1.1.  Maintenance  Activity Reports (MARs).   MARs will be prepared  using DIAMONDS to report changes in status of weapons, components and reportable Other Major Assemblies (OMAs)  to  the  MASO.    (T-0).    The  MASO  will  ensure  accurate  and  timely  reporting  to higher headquarters and JCS as required.  (T-1). 9.1.2.  Units  will  ensure  all  changes  listed  in  the  Transaction  Code  tables  of  TO  11N-100-3150 that occur are reported to NARS via the MAR IAW TO 11N-3150-8-1.  (T-0). 9.1.3.  Units must report the following actions:  (T-0). 9.1.3.1.  Changes to the first character of the charge code require an MTO. 9.1.3.2.  For weapons selected for SLT or SFT, change the charge code as directed by the SLT or SFT warning order or upon receipt of warning order message. 9.1.3.3.  For  weapons  requiring  shipment  to  DOE  facilities  for  repair,  change  the  last character of the charge code when UR disposition is received directing return to DOE. 9.1.3.4.  For weapons selected for alteration, change the last character of the charge code when directed by the RO, or when directed by message.  Change the charge code back to the original charge code as the RO is accomplished on each weapon. 9.1.3.5.  NCP will direct other charge code changes by NCPO in the monthly NOSS.  (T-2). 9.1.4.  Other actions that may not  require reporting but  affect  other  accountable records the MASO will maintain include: 9.1.4.1.  Build-up/tear-down  configuration  of  weapons  to/from  RS  or  pylon/  launchers.  (T-2). 9.1.4.2.  Association  or  disassociation  of  a  weapon  or  OMA  item  to/from  a  shipping container or bolster when being prepared for storage.   (T-2). 9.1.4.3.  Application  of  a  seal  to  a  containerized  weapon  or  OMA  in  order  to  preclude opening the container during semi-annual inventory.  (T-2). 9.1.4.4.  Removal  or  installation  of  non-LLC  components,  where  the  action  affects accountability of the item(s).  (T-2).  Examples include such items as tail sections or gas generators that are accountable, but not WSR or QSR reportable items.  The MASO will ensure these items are picked up or dropped from the account, when there is a removal or installation;  or  when  a  different  part  number  item  is  installed  from  the  one  that  was removed.    (T-2).    Since  the  MASO  must  account  for  these  items,  maintenance  must report actions involving them to the MASO.  (T-2). 9.1.4.5.  Condition Code changes for Non-TO 11N-100-3150 reportable items issued on custody account.  (T-2). AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 73 9.1.4.6.  Association and unassociation of H-Gear.  (T-2). 9.1.4.7.  Other actions as required by local instructions.  (T-3). 9.1.5.  If the verification inspection of containerized weapons cannot be accomplished on the day of receipt, take the following actions pending completion of a verification inspection: 9.1.5.1.  Prepare  the  MAR  for  receipt  and  add  the  statement  "Interim  report  pending verification inspection" in the “Maintenance Remarks” section. 9.1.5.2.  MASO  will  hold  the  DD  Form  1348-1A  and  DD  Form  1911  in  suspense  until verification inspection is completed.  (T-1). 9.1.5.3.  Once  verification  inspection  is  complete,  MASO  will  verify  all  associated documentation for accuracy and process all forms held in suspense.  (T-1). 9.2.  Weapon Status Report (WSR).  The MASO will prepare WSRs using DIAMONDS.  (T-0).  DTRA requests corrections to WSRs received with errors through the NCP. Corrections are due 1200 next day following notification to the unit.  NCP will discuss the type of error and the corrective action with the applicable MAJCOM and reporting activity, as they occur to preclude further  errors.    Recommendations  for  changes  to  the  stockpile  database  or  processing  methods are made when discrepancies are noted. 9.3.  Container Asset Report (CAR).  The MASO prepares and submits CAR IAW 11N-100-4. 9.4.  Quality  Assurance  Service  Test  (QAST)  Status  Report  (QSR).  Prepare and submit the QSR using DIAMONDS as outlined in TO 11N-100-3150 and TO 11N-3150-8-1.   (T-0).  The purpose of this report is to ensure accurate accountability between DoD and DOE of SS nuclear material.  Requirements for inventory and reconciliation of SS materiel between DoD and DOE are covered in TO 11N-100-4. 9.4.1.  Reporting changes for OMAs to the MASO.  Maintenance personnel will report status changes  for  OMAs  to  the  MASO  using  procedures  in  paragraph  9.1.  above.    (T-2).    The MASO will report status changes to DTRA via a QSR.  (T-2). 9.4.2.  Items  that  require  OMA  reporting.    Reporting  requirements  apply  to  OMAs  that contain  SS  materiel.    Reporting  is  by  end  item  type  (using  a  modified  weapon  code),  and serial number. 9.4.2.1.  If  a  reporting  activity  can  verify  the  item  either  does  or  does  not  contain reportable  quantities  of  SS  materiel,  they  will  report  the  item  as  such  using  the appropriate  letter  in  the  fourth  position  of  the  OMA  code.    (T-2).    The  MASO  will accomplish  this  verification  by  reviewing  the  DOE/NRC  Form  741  delivered  to  the service when the item is originally delivered.  (T-2).  The DOE/NRC Form 741 indicates which SS materiel items are contained within the OMA. 9.4.2.2.  Once an item is verified and properly entered into the DTRA database, presence or lack of SS materiel need not be verified again. 9.5.  Location  Inventory  Listing  (LIL).  The  DLIL  contains  unit  stockpile  information extracted  from  the  DIAMONDS  database  at  DTRA.    DTRA  prepares  the  DLIL  monthly  and publishes it on the “Support Center” site DB screen.  The purpose of this report is to provide a product  for  the  monthly  reconciliation  of  unit  records  and  stockpile  information  contained  in 74 AFI21-203  12 MAY 2016 DIAMONDS.    It  also  provides  the  unit  a  tool  for  scheduling  and  managing  maintenance activities. 9.5.1.  Reconcile by comparing the SLIL with the DTRA LIL (DLIL) (electronic or manual).  After reconciliation is complete, the SLIL will be used for day-to-day stockpile management since SLIL is updated as transactions occur.  (T-2). 9.5.2.  Monthly  Reconciliation.    Within  five  duty  days  of  receipt,  NARS  personnel  must reconcile the new DLIL against the SLIL.  (T-2). 9.5.2.1.  Transactions reported after the effective date of the DLIL, but before its receipt, are carried forward. 9.5.2.2.  If  discrepancies  are  found,  NARS  personnel  will  validate  against  accountable documents.  (T-2).  Report to the MAJCOM any discrepancies that cannot be reconciled locally.    The  MAJCOM  then  assists  the  unit  through  coordination  with  NCP  to  resolve the discrepancy. 9.5.2.3.  NARS  personnel  will  load  and  verify  LLC  kit  pack  dates,  internal  LLC  serial numbers  for  weapons  received  since  last  reconciliation  into  the  DIAMONDS  database.  (T-2).  NARS personnel will validate due dates during next LIL reconciliation.  (T-2). 9.5.2.4.  NARS  personnel  will  load  unassociated  (notional)  due  dates  for  serviceable components received since the last reconciliation into the DIAMONDS database.  (T-2).  NARS personnel will validate due dates during next LIL reconciliation.  (T-2). 9.5.2.5.  Once  reconciliation  is  complete,  NARS  personnel  will  document  completion. Inform  the Operations Officer (OO)/Maintenance Superintendent  (MX SUPT) the SLIL is ready for review.  (T-2). 9.5.3.  Local  distribution  of  the  SLIL.    NARS  personnel  may  distribute  the  SLIL  (paper  or electronic)  to  other  duty  sections  as  required.    If  other  sections  utilize  the  SLIL,  it  is  their responsibility to reconcile their copy against the copy maintained by NARS personnel.  If the LIL  is  maintained  in  other  sections,  the  other  sections  must  maintain  and  update  it  in  the same manner as the copy maintained by NARS personnel.  (T-3). 9.5.4.  SIR  LIL  Reconciliation.    As  a  part  of  the  SIR,  NARS  personnel  will  verify  the accuracy  of  the  SLIL  against  information  contained  on  the  completed  blind  inventory worksheets.  (T-2).  At a minimum, NARS personnel will ensure all weapon information and unassociated component serial numbers are accurate as compared to information recorded on the blind inventory worksheets.
