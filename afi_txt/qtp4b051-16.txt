Combined noise level of like sources  Two identical sources (each with the same number of decibels) produce 3 dB more than a single such source.  The decibel level of more than two identical sources is determined by the following formula which provides an exact method of adding decibels when all sources are identical:  dBtotal =10logn+dB1 Where:  n = known quantities/number of identical sources.  dB1 = dB level of a single source.  Example: There are four sources of noise in the shop each of which is 95 dB.   Step 1 – Identify the correct formula  dBtotal=10logn+dB1  Step 2 – Replace the variables in the formula dB total = 10 log 4 + 95  Step 3 – Log the “n” dB total = 10 x 0.602 + 95  Step 4 – Multiply the logged “n” by 10 dB total = 6.02 + 95  Step 5 – Solve the equation dB total = 101.02 dB   2.  Combined noise level of different sources  Make sure the decibels being added all have the same weighting..  The following formula is used to calculate the combined noise levels of different sources:  𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡=10 log �10dB110+10dB210+…10dBn10�  Where:  dB1, dB2, dBn = dB reading of each different source  Example: The shop has four sources of noise, all from different types of equipment, the measured decibel levels are 96 dB, 97 dB, 88 dB, and 93 dB.  Step 2 – Replace the dB1 …dBn in the numerator of the fractional exponent.  Step 1 – Identify the correct formula  𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡=10 log �10dB110+10dB210+…10dBn10� 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡=10 log �10𝟗𝟗𝟗𝟗10+10𝟗𝟗𝟗𝟗10+ 10𝟖𝟖𝟖𝟖10+10𝟗𝟗𝟗𝟗10� Step 3 – Simplify the fractional exponent dBtotal  = 10 log (109.6 + 109.7 + 108.8 + 109.3)   Step 4 – Add the quantities for the dB level calculated dBtotal  = 10 log (3,981,071,706 + 5,011,872,336 + 630,957,344.5 + 1,995,262,315) 3  AFQTP 4B051-16                                                                                            Journeyman Training Guide:  Noise   Step 5 – Find the log of the new product  dBtotal = 10 log (11,619,163,701.5) Step 6 – Multiply by 10 to arrive at the calculated dB dBtotal = 10 x 9.06517487 dBtotal  = 90.65 dB   3.   Calculating equivalent continuous sound level If you have exposures to two or more levels in one day, you can use the following formula to calculate the Let.

Example: During a routine surveillance survey of the Phase Dock, BE identified a new inspection activity. As part of the evaluation process a special survey has been scheduled. The special survey requires you to evaluate the noise sources associated with the phase activity and make appropriate recommendations. You have been provided with a list of noise sources with approximate daily operational times. You surveyed those sources with a SLM and obtained the following data.

When multiple noise sources are present, must you test the worker at each station?  What must you keep in mind when you evaluate multiple sources? A:  Yes; mixed sounds could give you an inaccurate reading.  You must evaluate all sources and find the ones that are significant to the noise exposure.  (Source: 4B051 CDC)          2.  Explain the reasoning and proper hand orientation of a random incidence microphone to the source.  A:  Random incidence microphones are designed for “grazing” angles; it must be hold at 70 degrees or nearly perpendicular to the source.  (Source: 4B051 CDC)  3.  In a situation when the actual sound level is unknown, how should you operate your meter?  How do you determine an average reading? A:  You  should start the SLM at the highest range (130-140 db(A)); take readings roughly every 15 seconds for three to five minutes and calculate an average using the following formula dBavg=10log�10dB110� +10dB210� + …10dBn10�� n (Source: 4B051 CDC)   16  AFQTP 4B051-16                                                                                            Journeyman Training Guide:  Noise    STS Line Item 4.10.8:  Perform worker exposure surveys  (Dosimetry)   Proficiency Code: PC Definition: Prerequisites: Training References: Additional Supporting References: CDC Reference: Training Support Material: Specific Techniques: Criterion Objective:  TRAINER GUIDANCE 3c Can do all parts of the task.

This is called a dB all pass (flat or linear reading). dB flat means that equal weighting is given to all frequencies. Procedures for conducting an octave band analysis are similar to those for the noise source survey using the SLM. The main difference is the frequencies at which measurements are taken. For SLMs with the octave band filters attached, measurements are taken for dB(A), dB flat, and one for each of the octave bands. With a digital octave band analyzer, readings are automatically taken for the required frequencies.  2.  Preferably, the operator will be at least three feet away.  3.  A microphone is typically designed for use in a particular environment across a specific range of SPLs and frequencies. In addition, microphones differ in their directionality.

Noise Reduction Rating Method Formula:  To determine the at-the-ear A-weighted SPL using the NRR method, subtract 7 dB from the NRR and subtract the adjusted NRR from the A-weighted SPL for the noise source. This is reflected in the following formula:  SPL in dB(A) – (NRR – 7 dB) = presumed at the ear exposure 5.  Double Hearing Protection - Add 3 dB to the highest noise reduction rating (NRR) of the plug or muff  to estimate the combined protective rating if actual attenuation data for the combination is not available.              34  AFQTP 4B051-16                                                                                            Journeyman Training Guide:  Noise   TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS    STS Line Item 4.10.12 - Verify adequacy of hearing protection devices  (calculate attenuation factor) 1.
