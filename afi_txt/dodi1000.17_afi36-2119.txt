The IG  DoD will provide written notification to the DoD Executive Secretary upon such instance.  3.  POLICY.  It is DoD policy that: a. Details outside the DoD will be executed only when they promote the increased effectiveness of the U.S. Government, are not duplicative, and produce a more economic use of government resources, in accordance with the guidance in Enclosure 2 of this instruction. b. Funds are appropriated to pay for DoD personnel to carry out DoD’s missions.  As a general policy, and consistent with section 1535 of Title 31, U.S.C. also known as “The Economy Act,” as amended (Reference (n)), the Department of Defense will approve requests for details outside the Department only on a reimbursable basis. (1)  Non-reimbursable details will be executed only if non-reimbursement is specifically authorized by statute; the detail has a minimal effect on the loaning agency’s appropriations; or the employee will be performing functions consistent with those for which DoD funds are appropriated and the greater benefit of the detail accrues to the Department of Defense. (2)  The external duties normally will relate to matters ordinarily handled by the Department of Defense, and aid the Department in accomplishing its functions.  Details may be beneficial to both agencies, but absent a clear showing of preponderant benefit accruing to the Department of Defense, approval will normally be on a reimbursable basis. (3)  Details  outside  of  DoD  where  DoD  personnel  are  performing  a  DoD  mission,  but simply working  at  a  facility controlled  by another  agency,  such  as  a  liaison  position,  are  non- reimbursable. c.  Detail of members of a Reserve Component in a federal status that are on active duty other than for training will only be considered as an exception to policy when: (1)  There are no other qualified personnel within the available Active Component.               (2)  The parent organization agrees to resource the requirement. (3)  The detail is deemed a valid requirement that is in the best interest of the Department.  d. Personnel will be detailed and employed according to terms approved by the DoD Executive Secretary and within the limitations of Enclosure 2.  Without prior approval from the DoD Executive Secretary, personnel will not be:                           (1)  Detailed to perform substantially different duties from those formally approved.           DODI 1000.17_AFI 36-2119                                                                                                        5                           (2)  Transferred intra-agency.  (3)  Transferred or assigned to a different duty position. (4)  Transferred, assigned, or detailed to another agency.         e.  (Added)(AF) AF policy is established in AFPD 36-21.   4.

DETAILS OUTSIDE THE DoD a.  DoD personnel may be detailed to non-DoD agencies to support a specific project, for a pre-determined duration, where it is judged that: (1)  DoD personnel are uniquely qualified within the U.S. Government to accomplish the task. (2)  The detail furthers identifiable DoD interests. b.  All details will be for the minimum possible duration.  Extensions, not to exceed 1 year, may be considered on a case-by-case basis. c.  All requests for outside DoD details are subject to a formal process. d.  DoD personnel are not authorized to report to an agency outside the DoD until such time that the DoD Executive Secretary approves the detail request. e.  All temporary duty assignments in excess of 14 calendar days to an agency outside the DoD must be processed in accordance with this instruction.  Temporary duty that does not exceed 14 calendar days must still be documented in a formal memorandum addressed to the DoD Executive Secretary detailing what duties the individual will be performing and the duration.  In all cases of temporary duty, formal approval by the DoD Executive Secretary is required before commencement of the duties to be performed. 2.  DETAIL FUNDING a.  Non-reimbursable details will be executed only if the employee will be performing functions consistent with those for which DoD funds are appropriated and DoD gains the greater benefit of the detail, a relevant statute authorizes the detail on a non-reimbursable basis, or the detail has a minimal effect on the loaning agency’s appropriations.  All requests for non- reimbursable support must include rationale describing how the detailee will be performing functions consistent with those for which DoD funds are appropriated and how the DoD gains the greater benefit of the detail, or identify the authority that authorizes the detail to be performed on a non-reimbursable basis. b.  Details to international organizations may be made with or without reimbursement to the United States, in whole or in part, as provided by section 3343 of Reference (f).  DODI 1000.17_AFI 36-2119                                                                                                        9                                                              c.  Details to the White House Office, the Executive Residence at the White House, the Office of the Vice President, the Domestic Policy Staff, or the Office of Administration determined to be subject to section 112 of Title 3, U.S.C. (Reference (p)) will be on a reimbursable basis following any period of 180 calendar days in any fiscal year in which detailed. d.  Other statutes not listed in this instruction may authorize details between DoD and other specific elements of the federal government, such as to the intelligence community, the State Department, or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  When a detail relies upon one of these specific statutes as the underlying authority for the detail, the limitations of the statute with respect to duration and any requirement for reimbursement must be complied with. e.  Consistent with section 8062 of Public Law 112-74 (Reference (q)), or similar annually recurring provision that is applicable in future fiscal years, details to agencies that are more than 90 days late in discharging payment to DoD for previously provided reimbursable goods or services will not be considered. f.  Official travel or training undertaken on behalf of or directed by the host will be funded accordingly.  The host organization will provide the necessary funding or reimburse detailees directly for any training or travel in accordance with chapters 300 through 304 of Title 41, Code of Federal Regulations (Reference (r)).  Any travel must be approved in advance by host management and the detailee’s parent organization. 3.  DETAIL RESTRICTIONS a.  Personnel will not be detailed outside the DoD when such a detail would be the individual’s final tour before retirement or separation. b.  Personnel are prohibited from serving on back-to-back details within the same or to another government agency. c.  Personnel will not be detailed for any period (initial or in combination with an approved extension) that exceeds 4 consecutive years outside the DoD. d.  No details of DoD civilian personnel or military members are permitted to the Legislative Branch of the U.S. Government except under the terms and conditions of References (d) and (e).                       10                                                                                                            DODI 1000.17_AFI 36-2119                                                                                                ENCLOSURE 3 RESPONSIBILITIES 1.

The DoD Executive Secretary, or DA&M, may, when not otherwise prohibited by law, grant waivers to provisions of this instruction.  The DA&M will coordinate with the DoD Executive Secretary before granting any waivers. 2.  REIMBURSEMENT         a.  Arrangements.  Reimbursement arrangements will be formally developed during the staffing process between the appropriate parent DoD Component and the gaining agency.              (1)(Added)(AF) All gaining agency requests must identify the telephone number, contact information and the name of the gaining agency’s budget point of contact responsible for the reimbursement.             (2)(Added)(AF) SAF/FMB is responsible for the reimbursements of Air Force detailees upon completion of a MOU or MOA and assignment of Air Force personnel to an outside DoD agency.  MOU/MOAs are prepared and endorsed by the outside DoD agency and must be approved by OSD/ES. (T-0)                  (a)(Added)(AF) Reimbursements shall be documented in the following manner and coordinated with SAF/FMB:                             (1)(Added)(AF) Upon approval of AF personnel assignment to an outside agency, DoD and the gaining agency will sign a MOU/MOA.  SAF/AARC will immediately notify the SAF/FMBOP Budget Analyst of the approval/assignment of an AF individual to an outside DoD agency.  Notification by SAF/AARC will also include a copy of the signed approval letter and the telephone number and name of the gaining agency’s budget POC.                           (2)(Added)(AF) Upon receipt of the Assignment Approval Letter, DoD and gaining agency MOU/MOA, gaining budget POC and contact info, the SAF/FMBOP Budget Analyst contacts the outside agency’s Budget/Finance POC and makes arrangements for reimbursement. The rate charged is based on the Department of Defense composite rates which are published annually by the Office of the Secretary of Defense Comptroller.  Using the OSD (Comptroller) rates schedule and the member’s rank, the SAF/FMBOP Budget Analyst  14                                                                                                               DODI 1000.17_AFI 36-2119                                                                                          calculates the amount of reimbursement due to the Air Force and provides the information to  the Defense Finance and Accounting Service-Indianapolis (DFAS-IN) POC responsible for Air Force accounts receivables accounting.             (3)(Added)(AF) The DFAS-IN clerk prepares a Standard Form 1081, Voucher and Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits, for billing or processes an Intergovernmental Pay and Collection (IPAC) transaction to bill and/or collect the funds from the gaining agency.  DFAS-IN prepares and sends bills to customers on a quarterly basis.  In some cases, the customer agency prepares the IPAC and pushes the transaction to the Air Force.  This is coordinated between SAF/FMBOP and the outside agency Budget/Finance POC.             (4)(Added)(AF) The SAF/FMBOP Budget Analyst ensures collection of all funds due to the Air Force using reimbursement reports.  Based on the quarterly updates from SAF/AARC, the SAF/FMBOP Budget Analyst adjusts reimbursements or terminates collection as required.                  b.  Administration.  As appropriate, approved requests will reflect the reimbursement basis and be administered as described in DoD 7000.14-R (Reference (t)). 3.  REQUESTS a.
