Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the  superintendent  skill  level  play  an  important  role  in  the  Air  Force's  ability  to  accomplish  its mission.  It is essential that everyone involved in training must do his or her part to plan, manage,  13 and conduct an effective training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their career. 5.1.  Apprentice  (3)  Level.    Initial  skills  training  in  this  specialty  consists  of  the  tasks  and knowledge provided in the 3-skill level resident course (M3ABR5J031 0P3X, Paralegal Apprentice Course) and results in the award of AFSC 5J031.  Task and knowledge training requirements are identified in the STS at Part II, Sections A and B. 5.2. Journeyman (5) Level.  Upgrade training to the 5-skill level in this specialty consists of: 5.2.1. Task and knowledge training provided in CDC 5J051; and 5.2.2. Completion of core tasks identified with a single asterisk “*” in Attachment 2, column 2A of Part II of the CFETP. 5.3. Craftsman (7) Level.  Begin UGT to 7-skill level when selected for promotion to SSgt but no sooner  than  the  first  day  of  the  promotion  cycle,  except  for  Stripes  for  Exceptional  Performers (STEP) promotees  and  retrainees.   If the member is  a SSgt  or above, begin  7-skill  level  upgrade upon award of the 5-skill level.  UGT consists of: 5.3.1. Completion of core tasks identified with  a single asterisk“*” in  Attachment 2, columns 2A and 2B of Part II of the CFETP;  5.3.2. The  Paralegal  Craftsman  Course  (Course  No.  M3ACR5J071  0P7X)  at  AFJAGS, Maxwell AFB, AL. 5.4. Superintendent  (9)  Level.    Must  hold  the  rank  of  senior  master  sergeant  (SMSgt),  meet mandatory  requirements  listed  in  specialty  description  in  AFECD  and  have  supervisor’s  and commander’s recommendation for the award of the 9-skill level. 6. Training Decisions.  A number of core tasks were realigned from 7-level to 5-level core tasks.These adjustments reflect a change in force structure within the paralegal career field since Non-Prior Service Students began to attend PAC in 2003.  As the ratio of NPS to Retrainees continues toward a 50/50 split, the overall paralegal experience level will continue to trend upwards. Training decisions  were  made  during  the  November  2015  Utilization  and  Training  Workshop/Specialty Training Requirements Team meeting.   6.1. Initial Skills.  The initial skills M3ABR5J031 0P3E Paralegal Apprentice Course was revised by  AFJAGS  to  provide  training  needed  to  prepare  graduates  for  paralegal  apprentice  related positions.  6.2. 5-Level Upgrade Requirements.  The CFETP will be revised to balance training requirements by focusing on foundational paralegal skills in order to standardize 5-level skill-sets in all areas of practice.   6.3. 7-Level  Upgrade  Requirements.    The  M3ACR5J071  0P7E  Paralegal  Craftsman  Course  was revised to provide education and training skills, in addition to the required core tasks identified in the STS. 14 6.4. Training quality requirements resulting from this November 2015 STRT/U&TW may result in upgrade training going beyond 24 months in some cases. 6.4.1. Air  Force  Reserve  Annual  Survey  of  the  Law  (ASL).    TAGCR  paralegals  must  attend  the ASL every two years, starting two years after their accession to TJAGCR, or two years after their first attendance at the Reserve Forces Paralegal Course, whichever occurs sooner. 7. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  Enrollment in CCAF occurs automatically uponjoining the United States Air Force.  Note:  Retrainees must request enrollment into the paralegal degree program whereas non-prior service (NPS) are automatically enrolled.   Additional off-duty education  is  a  personal  choice  that  is  encouraged  for  all.    Individuals  desiring  to  become  an instructor  must  possess  as  a  minimum  an  associate  degree  or  should  be  actively  pursuing  an associate  degree.    Special  Duty  Assignment  (SDA)  requires  an  instructor  candidate  to  have  a CCAF  degree  or  be  within  one  year  of  completion  (45  semester  hours).    A  degreed  faculty  is necessary  to  maintain  accreditation  through  the  Southern  Association  of  Colleges  and  Schools. CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate of Applied Sciences Degree.  In addition to its associate degree program, CCAF offers the following:   7.1. CCAF  Instructor  Certification  (CIC).    Provides  CCAF  faculty  a  structured  professional development track and tangible recognition for advanced levels of knowledge, skills, education and training, and instructional experience.    7.2. Trade Skill Certification.  When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill certification is  awarded  for  the  primary  occupational  specialty.    The  College  uses  a  competency  based assessment  process  for  trade  skill  certification  at  one  of  four  proficiency  levels:    Apprentice, Journeyman, Craftsman (Supervisor), or Master Craftsman (Manager).  All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript. 15 7.3.  Degree  Requirements.    Prior  to  completing  an  associate  degree,  the  5-skill  level  must  be awarded, PCC must be successfully completed, and the following requirements must be met: Technical Education Technical Core Civil Law *EthicsInternational Law Legal Claims & Tort Administration Legal Claims & Tort Investigation Legal Research & Writing Military Justice Nonjudicial Punishment Paralegal Internship Pre-Trial Administration Post-Trial Administration Technical Electives Computer Science Contract Law Criminal Law Criminal Procedures Environmental Law Estate Planning & Probate Evidence Family Law/Domestic Relations Law Office Administration Law Office Supervision & Training Real Estate Law Leadership, Management & Military Studies (LMMS) Physical Education General Education Oral Communication Written Communication Mathematics Social Science Humanities General Education Elective Semester Hours (SH) 24 9 3 3 6 3 9 6 3 8 3 3 6 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 6 4 18 Program Elective TOTAL *Must be completed as part of degree program; may be applied in technical core or humanities areaor general education elective area. 12 64 16 7.3.1.

Professional  Affiliations  and  Fraternal  Organizations.    The  Air  Force  recognizes  the importance and supports associations with professional organizations and membership in fraternal organizations  as  a  vital  tool  in  your  continuing  education  and  professional  development.    Such affiliations  and  membership  offer  opportunities  for  tangible  benefits  in  the  areas  of  leadership, networking,  team-building,  and  communication,  community  service,  and  most  of  all,  career enhancement.    The  Paralegal  CCAF  Associates  of  Applied  Science  Degree  is  approved  by  the American Bar Association.  17 8. Paralegal Development (RegAF only)8.1. Purpose.  To identify 5J0X1 Senior Master Sergeants and Senior Master Sergeant selects with the  experience,  training  and  education  to  fill  Key  Leadership  Positions  (KLPs)  and  to  identify 5J0X1 Master Sergeants and Master Sergeant selects with the education, training and experience to fill KLPs and Key Development Positions (KDPs) within the JAG Corps.  8.2. Process.  Active duty paralegals meeting the EDT should ensure the accuracy of their records at AFPC.  They must review and update their records no later than 30 days before the deadline to submit their EDT package.  Eligible SNCOs will submit their package, containing their SURF, PT History, and last 5 EPRS and forward it to his/her MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM).  During the  review,  panel  members  will  determine  whether  a  member  has  the  education,  training,  and experience necessary to fill a KLP and/or KDP.   8.3.  Enlisted  Development  Team  (EDT).    EDTs  ensure  senior  leaders  become  familiar  with  the people  assigned  to  their  functional  communities  and  make  assessments  of  their  qualifications  for future  opportunities.    They  ensure  those  with  required  qualifications  are  vectored  for  appropriate opportunities  and  help  CFMs  provide  their  Airmen  with  meaningful  and  actionable  feedback. EDTs also provide a whole person look using education, training, and experience prior to vectoring and  help  identify  a  slate  of  the  most  qualified  airmen  (vs.  most  TOS  eligible)  for  assignment consideration. 8.4, Key Developmental Position (KDP).  These are positions of responsibility that require SNCOs with  demonstrated  leadership  experience,  technical  skills,  and  professional  military  and  civilian education commensurate with their rank. Participants vectored to KDPs are ready to lead Airmen, mentor  officers,  supervise  civilians,  manage  projects,  and  maintain  readiness  to  ensure  mission success.  KDPs  require  SNCOs  to  lead  legal  activities  at  the  installation  level  and  serve  in  other specialized positions above the installation level. 8.5.  Key  Leadership  Position  (KLP).    These  are  positions  of  increased  responsibility  that  require mission-tested  SNCOs  with  leadership  experience,  advanced  technical  skills,  and  professional military  and  civilian  education  commensurate  with  their  rank.  Participants  vectored  to  KLPs  are ready to immediately lead Airmen, mentor officers, supervise civilians, manage complex projects, and maintain the highest level of readiness to ensure mission success. KLPs require well-rounded SNCOs  to  lead  large  legal  activities  at  the  installation  level  or  serve  in  specialized  positions  to support critical legal operations above the installation level.  9. Enlisted Career Path9.1.  Paralegal Career Path.  The chart below is provided only as an overview of a typical  career path.    Refer  to  AFI  36-2201,  AFI  36-2301,  AFI  36-2502  and  other  applicable  AFIs  for  current requirements. 18 Level Focus STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP & MANAGEMENT SNCOs gain breadth of experience, leadership and managerial perspective through support service and joint efforts.  SNCOs can build breadth with successful completion of developmental special duty assignments (PME, First Sergeant, Career Assistance Advisor) outside primary AFSC.  SNCOs may be assigned key duties as AFCFM, MFM, NAF Paralegal Manager, or Law Office Superintendent. OPERATIONAL BUILD BREADTH & DEPTH NCOs become skilled technicians and mature leaders.  NCOs can build breadth with joint & developmental special duty assignments (PME, Recruiter, etc.) outside primary AFSC. NCOs will build depth as NCOICs. TACTICAL DEVELOP COMPETENCY Airmen concentrate on learning their primary skill; hands-on OJT is required for upgrade to 5-skill level.

Paralegal Training Cycle.  The Paralegal career field training cycle is different from most other AFSCs  due  to  being  a  primarily  lateral  career  field.    In  addition  to  retraining  personnel  from different year groups, recruiting and retraining within different grades compound the challenge of charting a by-year/by-grade progression in this specialty.  The chart below is provided only as an overview of a typical training cycle with consideration for career field uniqueness.

Occupational Badges.  The following guidance outlines requirements for, and heraldic significance of, the Paralegal occupational badges.  For additional information, see AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel. Basic – Worn upon completion of technical school Senior – Worn after award of 7-skill level Master – Worn as a master sergeant or above with 5 years in specialty from award of 7-skill level Heraldic Significance The paralegal badge was approved in 1994.  The insignia consists of the scales of justice with quills and was taken from the Air Force judge advocate badge.  The scales of justice represent the military legal system, through which the Air Force maintains good order and discipline.  Regardless of a paralegal’s place of duty, the scales represent the commitment of the paralegal to the goal of justice in all adverse actions.  The scales also highlight the common critical link between the paralegal and the judge advocate.  The quill has long symbolized the scribe or tools by which the written word is produced.  The quills are crossed and rest under the base of the scales of justice to symbolize the essential support of the Air Force legal system given by our paralegal force.  The wreath encompassing the badge represents excellence. The wreath surrounds all the other symbols to show that excellence is the standard of performance for paralegals. 21 Section C - Skill Level Training Requirements  10.  Purpose.

Purpose.  This section identifies known resource constraints that preclude optimal and desired training  from  being  developed  or  conducted,  including  information  such  as  cost  and  manpower.  Narrative explanations of each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect each  constraint  has  on  training  are  included.    Also  included  in  this  section  are  actions  required, office  of  primary  responsibility,  and  target  completion  dates.    Resource  constraints  will  be,  as  a minimum, reviewed and updated annually.  13.  Apprentice 3-Skill Level Training.  13.1. Constraints.  The Judge Advocate General’s School may be unable to teach STS performance tasks unless student computers are upgraded/replaced on a normal IT life-cycle schedule.  13.1.1. Impact.  Students require computers and internet access to complete a substantial portion of the Paralegal Apprentice Course. Purchasing and maintaining student computers should be a high priority  as  degradation  of  service  very  likely  will  result  in  training  deficiencies.  Computer replacement must be an integral part of the AFJAGS financial planning and budgeting process. In addition,  students  must  be  able  to  access  several  TJAGC  mandated  computer  programs  (i.e. CapSil/CAMPUS, AMJAMS, LAWS, etc.) to satisfy course objectives. Software updates/upgrades with  the  potential  to  impact  student  access  must  be  identified  and  coordinated  between AFLOA/JAS and AFJAGS well in advance of the scheduled down-time to eliminate or minimize disruptions to class schedules  13.1.2. Resources  Required.    Purchase  new  computers  and  provide  responsive  student  computer support as needed to meet mission requirements.  13.1.3. Action  Required.    Computer  replacement  in  classrooms  at  the  AFJAGS  should  be prioritized  above  that  of  faculty  members,  and  should  be  programmed  into  AFJAGS  budget submissions.  This  will  help  ensure  that  students  have  what  they  need  to  complete  training requirements identified in Part II of this CFETP.  13.1.4. OPR/Target Completion Date.  AFJAGS & JAS.  14.  Journeyman, 5-Skill Level Training.  14.1. Constraints.  No 5-level constraints exist.  15.  Craftsman, 7-Skill Level Training.  15.1. Constraints.  The Judge Advocate General’s School may be unable to teach STS performance tasks unless student computers are upgraded/replaced on a normal IT life-cycle schedule.  15.1.1. Impact.  Students require computers and internet access to complete a substantial portion of the Paralegal  Craftsman  Course. Purchasing and  maintaining student computers should be a high priority  as  degradation  of  service  very  likely  will  result  in  training  deficiencies.  Computer replacement must be an integral part of the AFJAGS financial planning and budgeting process. In addition,  students  must  be  able  to  access  several  TJAGC  mandated  computer  programs  (i.e. CapSil/CAMPUS, AMJAMS, LAWS, etc.) to satisfy course objectives. Software updates/upgrades 26 with  the  potential  to  impact  student  access  must  be  identified  and  coordinated  between AFLOA/JAS and AFJAGS well in advance of the scheduled down-time to eliminate or minimize disruptions to class schedules  15.1.2. Resources  Required.    Purchase  new  computers  and  provide  responsive  student  computer support as needed to meet mission requirements.  15.1.3. Action  Required.    Computer  replacement  in  classrooms  at  the  AFJAGS  should  be prioritized  above  that  of  faculty  members,  and  should  be  programmed  into  AFJAGS  budget submissions.    This  will  help  ensure  that  students  have  what  they  need  to  complete  training requirements identified in Part II of this CFETP.  15.1.4.  OPR/Target Completion Date.  AFJAGS & JAS.   Section E - Transitional Training Guide  There are currently no transitional training requirements.  This area is reserved.     27          Part II Section A – Specialty Training Standard 1.  Implementation.  This  STS  will  be  used  for  technical  training  provided  by AFJAGS  for  the three-skill  level  Paralegal  Apprentice  Course  effective  with  class  PAC  16-006,  scheduled  to begin  on  9  August  2016 and graduating on 29 September 2011.  2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS: 2.1.    Lists  in  column  1  (Task,  Knowledge,  and  Technical  Reference)  the  most  common  tasks, knowledge,  and  Technical  References  (TR)  necessary  for  airmen  to  perform  duties  in  the  3, 5,  and  7-skill  level.  Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies by an asterisk ―*‖ specialty-wide training requirements. NOTE:  Tasks  are functionally  grouped  by subject  and/or  job  position  to  aid task  selection  and reduce  duplication.  Supervisors may select tasks from any attachment to accurately define a job.  The Paralegal Career Field Manager has mandated use of electronic training records (currently the  Training  Business  Area  {TBA})  for  document  training  for  5J0X1  personnel.    Requests  for waiver to this requirement must be submitted to AF/JAX (Attn: 5J0X1 Career Field Manager). training requirements.  Use  automated 2.2.  Provides  certification  for  OJT.  Column  3  is  used  to  record  completion  of  tasks  and knowledge to document  technician  qualifications, if  available.  Task  certification must show a certification or completed date.  (As a minimum,  use the following column designators:  Training Complete, Trainer Initials, Trainee Initials). training  management  systems 2.3.  Shows  formal  training  and  correspondence  course  requirements.  Column  4  shows  the proficiency to  be  demonstrated  on  the  job  by  the  graduate  as  a  result  of  training  on  the  task and knowledge and the  career knowledge provided by the correspondence course. 2.4. Qualitative Requirements (Attachment 1) contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the  level  of  training  and  knowledge  provided  by  resident  training  and  career  development courses. 2.5.  Use  to  document  task  completion  when  placed  in  AF  Form  623,  Individual  Training Record Folder  and used according to AFI 36-2201, Chapter 6. (WAPS).  Specialty  Knowledge  Tests  (SKTs)  are  developed  at 2.6. Is  a  guide  for  development  of  promotion  tests  used  in  the  Weighted  Airman  Promotion System the  USAF Occupational  Measurement  Squadron,  by  senior  NCOs  with  extensive  practical  experience  in their  career  fields.  The  test  samples  knowledge  of  STS  subject  matter  areas  judged  by  test development team members as most appropriate  for promotion  to higher grades.  Questions  are based  on  study  references  listed  in  the  WAPS  catalog.  WAPS  is  not  applicable  to  the  Air Reserve Component.     28 2.7. Documentation.  Identify  duty  position  requirements  by  circling  the  subparagraph  number next  to  the  task  statement.  Do  not  circle  core  tasks  not  related  to  the  current  duty  position. As  a  minimum,  complete  the  following  columns  in  Part  2  of  the  CFETP:  Training Completed,  Trainee  Initials,  Trainer  Initials.  An  AFJQS  may be  used  in lieu  of Part  II  of  the CFETP  only  upon  approval  of  the  AFCFM.  NOTE:  The  AFCFM  may  supplement  these minimum  documentation procedures as needed or deemed  necessary for their Career Field. 2.7.1. When completing the identification page, only the last 4 digits of the SSN are required. 2.7.2.  Transcribing  CFETP  documentation.  Transcribing  CFETP  documentation  to  a  new CFETP is an  administrative function and not a re-evaluation of training.  Upon publication  of a new  CFETP,  use  the  following  procedures  to  transcribe.  Use  the  new  CFETP  to  identify current  training  requirements  and  transcribe  qualifications  from  the  previous  CFETP.  For tasks  previously  certified  and  required  in  the  current  duty  position,  circle  the  subparagraph number  next  to  the  task  statement  and  enter  the  current  date  in  the  completion  column. Trainee  initials  in  the  trainee  column  and  the  current  task  certifier  or  supervisor/trainer initials  in  the  trainer  column.    For  tasks  previously  certified  but  not  required  in  the current duty  position  (do  not  circle),  transcribe  only  the  previous  certification  date  (no  initials). Annotate  the  AF  Form  623a,  (for  example,  ―I  certify  the  information  contained  in  the CFETP  dated  XX  was  transcribed  to  the  CFETP  dated  XX,  and  the  trainee  was  given  the superseded  CFETP.‖  signed,  dated,  supervisor  and  trainee).  After  necessary  actions  are completed,  post  this  sheet  in  the  back  of  the  CFETP. 2.7.3. Decertification and Recertification.  When an airman is found to be unqualified on a task previously  certified  for  his  or  her  assigned  position,  the  supervisor  lines  through  the  previous certification  or  deletes  previous  certification  when  using  automated  system.  Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form  623a, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to the reason for decertification.  The  individual  is  recertified  (if  required)  either  by  erasing or deleting  the  old  entries. 2.7.4.  Training  Standard.  Tasks  are  trained  and  qualified  to  the  go/no  go  level.  Go  means  the individual  can  perform  the  task  without  assistance  and  meet  local  demands  for  accuracy, timeliness, and correct  use of procedures. 2.8.  This CFETP will be used during the initial evaluation of all newly assigned personnel.  3.  Third  Party  Certification.  Core  tasks  identified  in  this  CFETP  do  not  require  third-party certification.                 29 4.  Recommendations.
