This guide is available on the ESOH Service Center AFMS  web site. In most cases the state has primacy and will conduct the sanitary survey. In those instances where the state is not conducting a sanitary survey, BE must complete the survey. Completing sanitary surveys at Air Force overseas installations is in most cases is the responsibility of BE. Installations outside the United States and its territories must follow country-specific Environmental/Final Governing Standards (EGS/FGS) and/or the Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD) (DoD 4715.5-G) as applicable, and implement AFI 48-144 in compliance with the OEBGD and EGS/FGS. Installations located in areas where no EGS/FGS exists must follow the OEBGD. Off-installation surveys must be coordinated with host nation authorities. The process of conducting a sanitary survey can vary by location, depending on system specific variables, but certain basic components must be evaluated in all situations. Three phases are necessary in completing a sanitary survey: Pre-survey Planning, On-site survey, and Reporting. This Training Module addresses the first two phases.  Safety is an important consideration when conducting field surveys. Potential safety hazards include confined space issues, falls or scrapes when climbing tanks, and insect bites.  1      AFQTP 4B051-20                                                              Journeyman Training Guide:  Potable Water Program    TASK STEPS  1.    Prepare for the survey by thoroughly reviewing the water system information files and historical data1 2.    Identify and list previous problem areas and solutions2 3.    Coordinate with required additional offices for subject matter expertise.   Conduct the on-site survey3 4.    Conduct a source water evaluation. 4 5.    Conduct treatment system evaluation. 5 6.    Conduct distribution system evaluation. 6 7.    Conduct finished water storage evaluation. 7 8.    Conduct pump/pump facility and control evaluation. 8 9.    Conduct monitoring, reporting and data verification evaluation. 9 10.  Evaluate water system operation and management. 10 11.  Evaluate operator compliance with state requirements. 11   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  NOTES:  1. Information that should be collected includes the treatment in place, monitoring requirements and procedures, the compliance history of the facility, and the condition of the system during the previous sanitary survey. Sources of information/data to be reviewed includes: previous sanitary surveys, additional correspondence, water system plans, chemical and microbiological sampling results, operating reports, and engineering studies. This information is used to identify questions to ask and assessment criteria to apply during the onsite survey.  2.    Points to address include whether the system is in compliance with all monitoring requirements and determining whether the system is in compliance with all applicable maximum contaminant levels (MCL).  3.    Personnel for SME can be located using the Sanitary Survey Master Listing located in the Drinking Water Sanitary Survey Checklist.  4.   Includes visiting the water supply source and source facilities, pump stations, the treatment process, storage facilities, distribution system, and sampling locations. One of the most important functions of the on-site portion of the survey is to determine whether the existing facilities are adequate to continue to provide reliable supply water that continuously meets State and Federal standards or AF requirements. The on-site visit should include review and verification of the capability and capacity, construction and operation, and physical condition of the water system’s facilities. There are eight essential elements: •  Element 1 - Source water evaluation •  Element 2 - Water treatment evaluation •  Element 3 - Distribution system evaluation •  Element 4 - Finished water storage evaluation  2 •  Element 5 - Pump and pump facility evaluation •  Element 6 - Monitoring, reporting, and data evaluation •  Element 7 - Operations and management evaluation •  Element 8 - Operator compliance with state requirements .  5.   Review the major components of the source to determine reliability, quality, quantity, and vulnerability.  Determine and evaluate data that define the potential for degradation of the source water quality.  6.   The treatment facilities and processes should be evaluated to determine their ability to meet regulatory requirements and to provide an adequate supply of safe drinking water at all times, including periods of high water demand.   That should be evaluated include design, operation, maintenance, and management of the water treatment plant to identify existing and potential sanitary risks. The sanitary survey should evaluate all areas of the treatment process and identify features of the treatment process that may pose a sanitary risk.   7.    Review system schematics, operation and maintenance records, standard operating procedures, construction standards, and distribution system water quality data.  8.    Verify the water system file information identified during the pre-survey review, to assess the tank’s structural condition, operational readiness, site security, and potential sanitary risks.  Check that maintenance identified during storage facility inspections has been completed.  9.   The objective of surveying the pumps/pump facilities and controls is to determine that water supply pumping facilities are reliable; and recognize any sanitary risks attributable to water supply pumping facilities.  Review the design, uses, and major components of water supply pumps; evaluate the operation and maintenance as well as safety practices.  10.  Review the water quality monitoring plan of the public water system for conformance with regulatory requirements. Verify that the water quality monitoring plan is being followed by checking test results.  Verify that all in-house testing as well as equipment and reagents being used conform to accepted test procedures. Consider whether any changes in monitoring frequency or location should be recommended for any contaminant or performance measure.  Verify the data submitted to the regulatory agency.  Evaluate the procedures an operator follows to identify any problems with the process, determine the changes needed to correct the problem, and how adjustments to the process are approved and performed as needed.  11.  Review the water quality goals and evaluate any plan(s) the system has to either accomplish or maintain the stated goals.  Identify and evaluate the basic information on the system, management, staffing, operations, and maintenance.  Review and evaluate the plan(s) for safety, emergency situations, maintenance, and security to maintain system reliability.  Evaluate the system’s revenue and budget for drinking water to establish the long-term viability of meeting water quality goals.  12.  Assess the competency of operators.  When evaluating the operators, it is important to know if the employees can operate and maintain equipment, if there are and adequate number to do so, and is this being completed.  Also, evaluate the certifications for each operator and the frequency of recertification.

From the ESOH Service Center, Water, WVA Pre-Assessment Tool, using Example WVA Activities Schedule as a guideline, plan sequencing of assessment to ensure that no steps are omitted. Be sure to use the WVA Update Protocol from the same source which will provide each element of the assessment process. Remember, although checklists are available for the assessment processes, they are merely aids and cannot cover every detail that might need further investigation. Apply professional judgment to the processes as well.      2.  The WVA Stakeholders List from the same source is especially helpful here. Every attempt should be made to identify and assess associated water systems owned or operated by entities that support the Air Force. Additionally, others who can be affected by the water being assessed should be part of the process. Questionnaire #1, AT & Critical Infrastructure Program Review for Water, and #2, Off-Base Water Supplier, under WVA Checklists can aid here.  Previous WVA’s, if available, will list the stakeholders that assisted during previous assessments.  3.  The same ESOH source contains the WVA Documents and Records Review List which is a valuable tool for ensuring that relevant information is obtained for the assessment. The list also includes reviewing any previous BE water assessments. In addition to system maps or drawings referenced in Note 1, relevant documents can include potable water system-related technical studies (e.g., hydro-geologic surveys, cross-connection surveys), inspection/assessment reports [e.g.,  (MICT)(Water Quality Management), Sanitary Survey, Vulnerability Assessment], maintenance contracts and reports, monthly operations report (e.g., operating logs), CE recurring work program, source water permits, etc. Questionnaires 5-8 also include items to be looked at during a review of pertinent information. Data gathering will require interaction with a number of other agency personnel.  These individuals should be “subject matter experts” and not simply agency “representatives.”   4.  Use Water Assets Inventory Worksheet from ESOH Service Center, Water, WVA Pre-Assessment Tool. Obtain a map of the base and surrounding area which shows all water assets, connection points, and natural water features that may impact the water supply. Another checklist which is valuable at this point is Questionnaire #3, Base Potable Water System, which can be found at the same source under the WVA Checklists section. Under the Bioterrorism Act, the assessment should include (but not be limited to) such elements of a system as pipes and constructed conveyances; physical barriers; water collection, pretreatment, treatment, storage and distribution facilities; electronic, computer or other automated systems utilized by the water system; the use, storage, or handling of various chemicals; and the operation and maintenance of such system. Use Questionnaire # 4, Review System Design Integrity. Conduct an “eyes on” physical assessment of water assets and access points. The goal is to identify vulnerable assets and access points and assess whether control measures designed for their security and survivability adequately meet criteria. Major assets encompass, but are not limited to, primary and emergency assets such as: •  Groundwater wells •  Surface water source intakes •  Cisterns or catch basins •  Transmission and distribution mains •  Transmission, distribution, and fire pumps •  Treatment units/facilities •  Tanks, bladders, and other bulk storage reservoirs •  Supplemental support systems (e.g., power and automated control and monitoring systems) •  Main isolation valves (particularly at major system interconnection points) •  Centrally-stored bottled water supplies  Additionally, specific access points of potential concern must be assessed. These access points commonly include, but are not limited to, the following: •  Exposed pipeline sections (e.g., aboveground, over-water crossings, and in meter/valve vaults) •  Standpipes, fire hydrants, and other major filling points •  Other main access points (e.g. backflow prevention devices, flushing and air release valves, and water main meters) •  Water trucks/tankers  •  Water trailers/buffaloes, drums, lyster bags (a canvas water bag used for supplying military 11  AFQTP 4B051-20                                                              Journeyman Training Guide:  Potable Water Program   troops with chemically purified drinking water), and other tactical distribution containers •  Unit-level stored bottled water supplies  •  Treatment chemical storage areas. •  Swimming pools       Questionnaires 9-17 can be used during the physical assessment of water assets and appurtenances and will aid in determining security and survivability of assets. The references cited above under “Additional Supporting References” can also add information to a physical assessment.  It is important that observation delineation began as soon as possible while memories are fresh. Identify deficiencies on a checklist which includes your observations. Refer to pages 41-46 in the Water Vulnerability Assessment Technical Guide for guidelines. 5. 6.  Risk analysis has three steps:  (1) Estimate probability and severity of a worst-case water quality degradation and/or disruption incident; (2) Estimate the risk level; (3) Prioritize observations. Refer to pages 47-53 of the Water Vulnerability Assessment Technical Guide for further discussion. One of the reasons for the risk analysis is that the risk assessment allows commanders and risk managers to quantify and weigh the relative risk of competing vulnerabilities, so that they can determine the most effective allocation of limited resources to protect people and critical assets. 7. Identify specific corrective actions which are practical and have precedent. 8.  The ultimate objective when developing the water vulnerability and risk assessment report is to furnish a product that best meets the needs of those who will utilize the information.  To address AF-unique structuring, program responsibilities, and funding avenues—it is recommended that deficiencies be delineated and ranked by risk within three functional areas: Antiterrorism/Force Protection, Sanitary Survey, and Contingency Response.  Based on previous experiences, a two-part report provides the best functional versatility at the installation level, particularly for the execution of corrective actions.   Part I is marked FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY and contains the following three elements:   (1)  An executive summary ideally no longer than two pages (2)  A main body that contains non-AT/FP Water Vulnerability Findings and support material for the following two potable water functional areas:   •  Sanitary Survey •  Contingency Response  (3)  Applicable Appendices, e.g., References, Methodology, Photographs, Support Materials (e.g., relevant AWWA Standards), etc.  Part II contains the same report elements, but pertains only to Antiterrorism/Force Protection findings.  This report, provided under separate cover, is classified SECRET.           This two-part report format provides a number of advantages: •  Non-AT/FP vulnerability findings can be routed, reviewed, and addressed without the restrictions associated with classified materials; this can be a special problem when risk managers and personnel responsible for “fixing” deficiencies do not have a qualified security clearance  •  Classified materials are routed through, and reviewed by only those individuals with a legitimate “need to know” program area   •  Risk managers are not burdened with sorting through vulnerability findings that do not pertain to their  The Water Vulnerability Assessment Technical Guide, pages 59-63, provides additional guidelines and suggestions for completing the report. 12  AFQTP 4B051-20                                                              Journeyman Training Guide:  Potable Water Program   TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS       STS Line Item 4.15.1.15:  Perform water vulnerability assessments 1.

LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  NOTES: 1.  The ESAM Plan identifies all drinking water sampling sites.  Do not sample from taps that allow water to flow over the outside of the tap.  If tap cleanliness is questionable, choose another tap or apply a solution of sodium hypochlorite (100 mg NaOCl/L) to the inside and outside of the tap; let water run for additional 2-3 minutes after treatment. 2.  Do not touch the inside of the collection container or cap. Do not rinse the collection container, as this will remove the de-chlorination agent. 3.  Preferably maintain sample temperature at <50o F during transit to the laboratory.  Analyze samples on the day of collection whenever possible and refrigerate overnight if analysis on the same day is not possible.  Do not exceed 30 hours holding time from collection to analysis for coliform bacteria.   17  AFQTP 4B051-20                                                              Journeyman Training Guide:  Potable Water Program   TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS       STS Line Item 4.15.1.16:  Perform aircraft watering point survey  1.

How often must you collect a sample from an aircraft watering point?  A:  As a minimum, BE will sample aircraft watering points monthly for bacteriological analysis.  More frequent monitoring may be warranted depending on the results of the sanitary survey.  (Source:  USAFSAM Drinking Water Surveillance Technical Guide (April 2011), Page 99,  Section 9.4)    2.  How often must trucks be sampled that are used for aircraft watering points?  A:  When trucks or tanks are used to transport water to aircraft, analyze a sample from one truck or tank at least once a month, and sample all trucks or tanks once each calendar quarter, unless prevented by less frequent truck use.  (Source:  USAFSAM Drinking Water Surveillance Technical Guide (April 2011), Page 99,  Section 9.4)   3. Where can the water source for aircraft come from?  •  A military installation potable water system managed in accordance with AFI 48–144. •  Public water supply approved by a primacy. • International airport potable water supplies in countries known to have drinking water standards and sanitation requirements consistent with EPA and FDA interstate commerce carrier drinking water regulations. •  Bottled water obtained from a supplier approved by the U.S. Army Veterinary Command or veterinary services personnel assigned to operational commands.  Bioenvironmental Engineering may approve suppliers when no information on suppliers is available.   (Source: 4B051 CDC) 20
