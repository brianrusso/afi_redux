This  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)  is  a  comprehensive  education  and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources,  and  minimum  core  task  requirements  for  this  specialty.  The  CFETP  will  provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training. NOTE:  Civilians  occupying  associated  positions  will  use  Part  II  to  support  duty  position qualification training.  2. The CFETP consists of two parts.  Supervisors plan, manage, and control training within the specialty using both parts of the plan.  2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.    2.1.1.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan.  2.1.2.  Section  B  identifies  career  field  progression  information,  duties  and  responsibilities,   training strategies, and career field path.  2.1.3.  Section  C  associates  each  level  with  specialty  qualifications  (knowledge,  education, experience, training, and other).  2.1.4.  Section D indicates resource constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and/or facilities.  2.1.5.  Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.  2.2.  Part II is used by supervisors and trainers at the unit level to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  2.2.1.  Section  A  identifies  the  Specialty  Training  Standard  (STS)  and  includes  duties,  tasks, technical  references  to  support  training,  Air  Education  and  Training  Command  (AETC) conducted training, wartime course and core task and correspondence course requirements.   2.2.2.  Section B contains the course objective list and training standards which supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements.   2.2.3.  Section  C  identifies  available  support  materials  that  have  been  developed  and  are mandatory for use to support On-the-Job Training.  2.2.4.  Section  D  contains  a  training  course  index  supervisors  can  use  to  determine  resources available to support training. Both mandatory and optional courses are included.      1 identifies  major  command  (MAJCOM)  unique 2.2.5.  Section  E training  requirements supervisors  can  use  to  determine  additional  training  required  for  the  associated  qualification needs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  2.2.6.  Section F is specific to medical Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) and provides guidance on  required  documentation  in  the  enlisted  training  and  competency  folder.  At  the  unit  level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  3.  Using  guidance  provided  in  the  CFETP  will  ensure  individuals  in  this  specialty  receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.    2  Abbreviations/Terms Explained  Advanced Training (AT).  A formal course providing individuals who are qualified in one or more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills/knowledge to enhance their expertise in the career field.

Purpose  of  the  CFETP.    This  CFETP  provides  the  information  necessary  for  AFCFMs, MFMs, commanders, training managers, supervisors, trainers and the applicable AETC training wing  to  plan,  develop,  manage,  and  conduct  an  effective  and  efficient  career  field  training program. This plan outlines training individuals must receive to develop and progress throughout their  career.  It  also  identifies  initial  skills,  upgrade,  qualification,  advanced  proficiency, sustainment,  and  continuing  education  and  training.  Initial  skills  training  is  the  AFS  specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into a specialty. For our career field, this training is provided by AETC, 382d Training Squadron (TRS) at Ft Sam Houston, TX. Upon successful completion of the training, individuals are awarded their 3-skill level AFSC.  1.1.  Upgrade  training  identifies  the  mandatory  courses,  task  qualification  requirements,  and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 5 and 7-skill levels. QT is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position. This training  program  occurs  both  during  and  after  the  UGT  process.  It  is  designed  to  provide  the performance  skills  and  knowledge  required  to  do  the  job.  Advanced  training  is  formal  AFS training used for selected airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence, exportable advanced training courses, or OJT, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.   1.2.  The CFETP also serves the following purposes:  1.2.1.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.  1.2.2.  Lists  training  courses  available  in  the  specialty,  identifies  sources  of  training,  and  the training delivery method.  1.2.3.  Identifies major resource constraints which may impact full implementation of the career field training process.  1.2.4.  Identifies  the  training  elements  required  for  Readiness  Skills  Verification  (RSV)  to ensure individuals are fully trained to meet contingency missions.  2.  Uses of the CFETP.  The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.  2.1.  AETC  training  personnel  will  develop  or  revise  formal  resident,  nonresident,  field  and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of  the  CFETP.  They  will  also  work  with  the  AFCFM  to  develop  acquisition  strategies  for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.  2.2.  MFMs  will  ensure  their  training  programs  complement  the  CFETP  mandatory  initial, upgrade,  and  proficiency  requirements.    OJT,  resident  training,  and  contract  training  or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into the plan.    6 2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority. Also, the AFCFM will initiate  an  annual  review  of  this  document  to  ensure  currency  and  accuracy.    MAJCOM representatives  and  AETC  training  personnel  will  identify  and  coordinate  on  the  career  field training requirements.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.  4.  Waiving  Specialty  Qualification  Requirements.    Qualification  requirements  for  this specialty  are  published  in  the  Air  Force  Enlisted  Classification  Directory  (AFECD)  and  this CEFTP. These requirements may be for entry, award or retention of this specialty and respective skill levels. Unique circumstances may warrant waiving certain requisites. Consideration for a waiver should not become the normal practice. However, a waiver can save training resources without  affecting  career  field  progression  or  mission  accomplishment  when  an  individual possesses qualifications equivalent to the established requirements.  4.1.  Evaluating  waiver  requests.    Supervisors,  managers,  and  leaders  must  compare  each waiver request individually and against predetermined standards in order to maintain integrity of the career field.   Scrutinize the individual’s task  knowledge, performance,  ability  to learn and transfer knowledge to performance, and his/her future within the specialty in relation to peers.  Waiver requests must consider the following factors:  4.1.1.  Education.    Has  the  individual  previously  completed  an  equivalent  education  or certification program (or equivalency test)?  Has the individual performed duty in an exceptional manner over an extended period of time in the actual or equivalent AFS or civilian occupation?  4.1.2.  Training.    Has  the  individual  completed  an  equivalent  technical  training  course  or civilian vocational training course, certification program (or equivalent test)?  4.1.3.  Knowledge.    Does  the  individual  possess  the  career  knowledge  equivalent  to  current requirements?  4.1.4.  Experience.    Supporting  documentation  must  include  proof  of  experience,  such  as performance  reports,  training  records,  state  or  federal  operating  licenses,  certificates  of affiliation, etc.  4.1.5.  Other.  Does the individual possess the physical ability, aptitude, or qualifications that are equivalent to, or commensurate with, the established requirement?  4.2.  Responsibilities.  4.2.1.  Individual.    Does  the  individual  acknowledge  possessing  the  prescribed  training requirements?    Trainees  must  understand  their  education  and  training  requirements,  accept responsibility for training, and document task qualification.  4.2.2.  Supervisor.  Did the commander and supervisor fulfill their obligations to the trainee and the  training  program?    Level  of  support  or  involvement  is  not,  by  itself,  justification  for approving waivers – it may indicate problems in training equity or other areas.    7 4.2.3.  Training system equity.  This area relates to circumstances beyond a trainee's control such as the following:  Were training or testing conditions abnormal?  Did the training or testing system provide the best opportunity for successful completion of training requirements?  Was the training or testing system flexible enough to allow for unexpected situations or conditions?  Did those  responsible  for  the  training  or  testing  program  fulfill  their  obligations  effectively?  Depending on the facts, this area may warrant options other than approving a waiver.  4.3.  Processing  waiver  requests.    Process  waiver  requests  according  to  AFI  36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) and AFI 36-2201.  5.  Air Force Training Record (AFTR).  The AFTR serves as the single, automated repository for all medical enlisted specialty training.  Consult the most current AFTR training message for detailed instructions regarding automated training documentation requirements.  5.1.  Documentation.    Use  the  automated  AFTR  to  document  all  technician  qualifications. NOTE:  An  AFJQS  may  be  used  in  lieu  of  Part  II  of  the  CFETP  only  upon  approval  of  the AFCFM. The AFCFM may supplement these minimum documentation procedures as needed or deemed necessary for the career field.  5.2.  Transcribing  a  new  or  revised  CFETP.    The  AFCFM  will  provide  transcription instructions to the AFTR program manager. This process will be seamless to the field user as all existing trainee records will be auto-transcribed.  5.3.  Decertification and recertification.  When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a task previously certified for his/her position, the supervisor deletes the previous AFTR documented certification.  Appropriate  remarks  are  entered  on  the  AF  Form  623A,  On-the-Job  Training Record  Continuation  Sheet,  identifying  the  reason  for  decertification.    Upon  subsequent recertification, document AFTR for any other training qualification.   8 Section B.  Career Progression and Information. 1.  Specialty Description: 1.1.    Specialty  summary.

In addition, they can be assigned to fill additional duty positions or work in various group or squadron positions at the MTF when required. Craftsmen should take courses or obtain added knowledge on management of resources and personnel.  Continued academic education through CCAF and higher degree programs is encouraged.  Advanced certification in optometry or ophthalmology is highly recommended.  Seven-levels can be appointed as OJT certifiers upon completion of the Air Force Training  Course.    Individuals  will  use  the  most  current  CDCs  and  any  other  reference  material according to the Enlisted Promotion References and Requirements Catalog (EPRRC) to prepare for testing under the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS) for promotion to TSgt and MSgt.    4.4.    Superintendent  (9-level).    Upgrade  to  the  9-level  consists  of:    (1)  Must  be  a  SMSgt.  (2) Completion  of  any  other  requirements  specified  in  the  AFECD.    An  individual  who  holds  a  9-level’s Primary AFSC (PAFSC) will be updated to 4V091 and, if applicable, the member’s 4V091S will  be  updated  to  reflect  their  secondary  AFSC  (2AFSC).    A  9-level  can  be  expected  to  fill  a superintendent position in either an optometry or an ophthalmology clinic.  Other positions a 9-level may fill are superintendent of a medical squadron or medical group.  Additional training in areas of budget,  manpower,  resources,  and  personnel  management  should  be  pursued  through  continuing education.

The 4V Medical Group (MDG) Functional Manager (FM) should be appointed by the MDG Commander.  Requirements of this position include award of a 7-skill level and a minimum of 3 years of experience as a 4V0X1/S.  11   4.5.2.  The 4V MDG FM shall provide oversight of 4V0X1/S manning, training, equipment, and any needed vision program oversight.  In addition, the 4V MDG FM may execute technician duties in both optometry and ophthalmology clinics in times of manning crisis.  The 4V MDG FM will advise  squadron  and  medical  group  leaders,  as  appropriate,  any  manpower  shortfalls,  training issues, and/or any other issues that could impact the optometry and/or ophthalmology mission.  It is highly recommended that the 4V MDG FM coordinate training and promote camaraderie among optometry, ophthalmology, and refractive surgery personnel, where all/any specialties are assigned.  Historically,  there  has  been  a  lack  of  communication  and  support  between  the  optometry  and ophthalmology professions due to each clinic being assigned to separate squadrons.  The base level 4V  FM,  along  with  their  leadership,  should  alleviate  this  possible  gap  and  create/enhance  an “Ophthalmic Team” atmosphere.   4.5.3.  The  4V  MDG  FM  will  coordinate  with  their  respective  4V  MFM  on  issues  concerning training and all matters that impact the eye care mission capability at the base they are assigned. The 4V  MDG  FM  should,  at  a  minimum,  make  every  effort  to  communicate  with  the  4V  MFM  and MDG Superintendent on a monthly basis.  4.5.4.  The 4V MDG FM may be assigned duties by clinic, squadron, and MDG leadership as well as the  4V  MFM.    The  4V  MDG  FM  may  assign  4V-specific  duties  and  responsibilities  to  the  4Vs assigned to their base.  4.6.   MAJCOM Functional Manager Duties:  4.6.1.    The  MFM  is  recommended  by  the  4V  AFCFM  and  appointed  by  the  MAJCOM  Surgeon General (SG).  Requirements of this position include award of a 9-skill level or award of a 7-skill level with at least 6 years of experience as a 4V.  4.6.2.  The 4V MFM keeps the AFCFM informed of issues in that MAJCOM.  Additionally, the 4V MFM works with the 4V MDG FM at each military installation of that MAJCOM to represent their needs  and  issues  to  the  MAJCOM  SG’s  office.    This  is  normally  accomplished  through  the MAJCOM Chief, Medical Enlisted Force (CMEF).    4.6.3.  The 4V MFM may receive assignments from the MAJCOM and/or the AFCFM.  In the event both  offices  assign  duties  that  are  mutually  exclusive,  contact  both  offices  for  guidance.  The  4V MFM should, at a minimum, make every effort to communicate with the AFCFM and the MAJCOM CMEF on a monthly basis.  4.7.  Air Force Career Field Manager Duties:  4.7.1.  The 4V AFCFM is nominated by the Optometry Consultant, the Ophthalmology Consultant and the outgoing 4V AFCFM to the Air Force Surgeon General (AF/SG).  The AFCFM must also be recommended by the AF/SG CMEF.  The AF/SG appoints the AFCFM for a 3 year tour (subject to change).    4.7.2.

Must possess a Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree in the specialty. Completion of Air  12 Force Senior NCO Academy correspondence or in residence is mandatory. Must meet all Air Force Standards.  Should have 2 years’ retainability.  4.7.3.  Additional qualifications are highly desirable, but not mandatory:  career field technical or academic  training  background  (as  instructor  and/or  course  developer)  and/or  experience  as  a primary 4V MFM.   4.7.4. The AFCFM may serve as the 4V MDG FM at their installation; however, these duties may be delegated by the AFCFM to the next senior ranking 4V.  The AF/SG or representatives may assign tasks to the AFCFM.  Local MDG leaders must acknowledge that there will be times when AF level duties will take priority over locally assigned duties.

This  CFETP  uses  a  building  block  approach  to  encompass  the  entire spectrum of training requirements for the ophthalmic specialty. This spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet these training requirements. This strategy is used to develop affordable  training,  eliminate  duplication  and  prevent  a  fragmented  approach  to  training.  The training strategy and plan outlined in this CFETP was formed during the 4V0X1/S Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) at JBSA-Fort Sam Houston, TX, 19-23 May 2014, from information identified  in  biennial  OSRs  and  training  requirements  analysis  conducted  by  the  Air  Force Occupational and Measurement Squadron and 4V0X1/S SME input. Changes to the CFETP were captured in the U&TW minutes and reside with the AFCFM.  6.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  CCAF is one of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions; however, it is the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military enlisted personnel. The college is regionally accredited through Air University by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degrees designed for specific Air Force occupational specialties and is the largest multi-campus community college in the world. Upon completion of basic military training and assignment to an Air Force career field, all enlisted personnel are registered in a CCAF degree program and are afforded the opportunity to obtain an AAS degree. In order to be awarded, degree requirements  must  be  successfully  completed  before  the  student  separates  from  the  Air  Force, retires, or is  commissioned  as an  officer.    See the  CCAF  website for details regarding the  AAS degree programs at http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/.  6.1.  Degree Requirements:  Figure 6.1., 4V Degree Requirements, is an excerpt from the current CCAF College Catalog as of the publication date of this CFETP and reflects the minimum degree requirements  for  an  AAS  degree.

Career Field Path.  The career pyramid, found at Figure 7.1., pictorially reflect job and skill  progression  pattern.  The  training  and  functions  are  aligned  with  rank  and  experience levels normally expected of someone in that period of his or her career. For instance, special duty assignments are normally not part of an individual’s career until they reach the grade of SSgt. We realize there will be exceptions, but you should use this as a guide to help determine training expectations and career planning. We strongly recommend FMs, superintendents, and supervisors rotate 3- and 5-skill level personnel through all major career tracks (displayed on  16 the pyramid) to better prepare them for supervisory and management responsibilities of the 7- and 9-skill levels.  7.1.    Enlisted  Career Path. The  grade  requirements for earliest sew-on times and high  year tenure  (HYT)  are  reflections  of  established  policy  (see  Table  1.1.).  Figure  7.2.  provides examples of specific special duty assignments and college education levels encouraged at each rank. Individuals should use this information to guide them through their career progression.                                             17     Figure 7-1.

There are currently no MAJCOM unique requirements.  This area is reserved.  42  Section F - Documentation of Training (Medical Specific)  1.  Work Center Training Plans.  The purpose of this section is to provide guidelines and examples of proper documentation for the many electronic forms used in training of all enlisted medical  personnel.  Training  documentation  helps  to  assess  readiness  capability  as  well  as individual strengths and weaknesses.  It also aids compliance with all The Joint Commission, Accreditation  Association  for  Ambulatory  Health  Care,  and  Health  Services  Inspections regulatory requirements.  The enlisted training documentation has migrated from the hard copy to  electronic  AFTR.    AFTR  is  accessible  from  the  Advance  Distributed  Learning  Service (ADLS) via the Air Force Portal.  Refer to the UTM for the most current policies and guidance on training documentation.   2.  Air  Force  Training  Record.    The  AFTR  is  an  enterprise-wide  custom  training management  system  designed  to  replace  the  paper-based  training  records  system.    It  is  the electronic equivalent of an AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder, and will be used by career fields within the AFMS to document all training actions.  The AFTR allows training plans to  be  established  by;  Career  Field/AFSC,  duty  position/team  member, trainee/trainer/certifier,  and  any  group  of  tasks  that  require  management,  tracking,  and documentation. The AFTR components managed by the supervisor are:   2.1.  Master  Task  List  (MTL).    The  MTL  is  a  list containing  all  the  tasks  that  are  to  be trained in a work center and is often broken out by specialty. The MTL consists of the STS; AF Form 623 Parts II and III; AF Form 797 and AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training; and Qualification Training Packages (QTPs). The supervisor creates the MTL by selecting tasks from the Unit Task List produced by the UTM and the STS.   2.2.  Master Training Plan (MTP).  The MTP is a list containing a schedule of training for all tasks within a particular duty position.  The MTP consists of the STS; 623 Parts II and III; AF Force Forms 797 and 1098 tasks; and QTPs.  The supervisor creates the MTP by assigning training times and methods to tasks in the duty position.  Refer to AFI 36-2201 and AFH 36-2235,  Volume  11,  Information  for  Designers  of  Instructional  Systems  Application  to  Unit Training, for guidance in developing the MTP.   2.3.  Duty Task List (DTL).  The DTL is a list containing all the tasks to be trained on in a duty position. The DTL consists of the STS; AF Form 623 Parts II and III; AF Force Forms 797 and 1098 tasks; and QTPs. The supervisor creates the DTL by selecting tasks from the MTL.   2.4. Individual Training Record (ITR).  All training is documented in the ITR.  This is the electronic version of the former Enlisted Training and Competency Folder.  The ITR is made up of the AF Form 623 Parts I, II and III; AF Forms 623A, 797, 803 and 1098; QTPs and the JQS.    This record is  automatically  populated based  upon the duty  position the individual is assigned to.  Refer to AFI 36-2201 for guidance in documenting training on the various forms contained within the ITR. Maintenance of the CFETP is mandatory for all assigned MSgts and below.  The AFTR provides the capability to incorporate training source documents and/or to manually enter completed training into the ITR. The following documents will be incorporated into the ITR:     43  2.4.1.  The member’s initial MTF and clinic orientation checklists.   2.4.2.   Recurrent  training  such  as  Basic  Life  Support  and  Health  Insurance  Portability  and Accountability Act.   2.4.3.  AF Form 2096, Classification/On-the-Job Training Action.   2.4.4.  Medical  Education  &  Training  Campus  (METC)  Student  Training  Report  (STR).  METC  STR  documents  the  level  of  success,  strengths,  and  weaknesses  that  a  student demonstrated during technical school.  It is emailed to the base training manager shortly after the graduate arrives at his/her duty station.  This form is maintained in the record until 5-skill level upgrade training is complete.   2.4.5.  AF  Form  803,  Report  of  Task  Evaluation,  will  be  used  to  conduct  and  document completion  of  task  evaluations  during  training  staff  assisted  visits,  when  directed  by  the commander, or when a task certification requires validation.   2.4.6.  Other forms as appropriate.   3.  Documentation of  Training.   The purpose of this section is to provide  guidelines and examples  of  proper  documentation  on  the  many  forms  used  in  training  medical  materiel personnel.  Training documentation helps to assess mission capability and readiness, individual strengths  and  weaknesses,  resources  needed  to  support  quality  patient  care,  and  defines requirements for individual career progression.   3.1.  AF  Form  797,  (Figure  3.1.)  will  be  used  to  record  training  for  tasks  that  are  not otherwise documented in the CFETP.  3.2.  AF Form 1098, (Figure 3.2.) will be used to record mandatory training requirements which may vary from facility to facility. At a minimum, these requirements should be reviewed on an annual basis and updated as required.  3.3.  QT Progress Records were developed to enhance OJT.  It provides the trainer with a breakdown of task performance skills to aid in performance evaluation.   The  evaluations of each task results in either a satisfactory or unsatisfactory score (Figure 3.3).  3.4.  AF  Form  623A,  (Figures  3.4.  thru  3.7.)  will  be  used  in  the  AFTR  to  document  all progress of individual training.  Document on AF Form 623A the start and completion dates of unit orientation, and reference the date of the orientation checklist.  In addition, document the member’s  entry  into  upgrade  training,  initial  evaluation  results,  and  periodic  evaluations  of training  progress  to  include  CDC  progress.    Information  on  extensions,  waiver  requests,  or breaks  in  training  should  be  clearly  documented.    Document  on  the  AF  Form  623A  any decertification proceedings, including dates,  reasons for decertification,  and other applicable information.  Accomplish an initial evaluation when a new person arrives to the unit or when an individual changes duty positions. Document all other actions pertaining to training IAW AFI 36-2201.      44  Figure 3.1.  Sample, AF Form 797 documentation     Figure 3.2.  Sample, AF Form 1098 documentation   45    Figure 3.3.
