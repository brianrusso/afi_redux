This  manual  implements  policy,  assigns  responsibility  and establishes procedures for motor vehicle traffic supervision on Air Force installations located in the continental  United States (CONUS), outside  the continental  United States (OCONUS), and deployed  locations,  where  implemented.  This  AFMAN  provides  additional  Air  Force  specific guidance to complement guidance found in AFI 31-218 (I) and will take precedence if there are conflicts. The objective of traffic control programs is the safe and efficient flow of vehicles and pedestrians through reduction of factors contributing to accidents. 1.3.  Delegation  of  Authority.  Installation  commanders  may  delegate  their  responsibilities under  this  manual  to  their  vice  commanders,  mission  support  commanders  or  other  group commanders  as  appropriate  provided  the  individual  does  not  occupy  a  position  such  as  law enforcement which would constitute a conflict of interest. Commanders should coordinate letters of delegation through their staff judge advocates (SJA).  AFMAN31-116  18 DECEMBER 2015 3 Chapter 2 DRIVING PRIVILEGES 2.1.  Requirements  for  Driving  Privileges.  Each  Installation  Commander  will  determine  if international  driver’s  licenses  are  recognized  and  authorized  for  use  on  the  installation.  (T-2). Take into consideration the local (civilian) jurisdiction’s policy on recognition and acceptance of international driver’s licenses. As a general rule, most CONUS civilian jurisdictions honor use of international  driver’s  licenses  for  short  periods  of  time  by  non-resident  visitors  and  assigned military personnel and dependents. When practical, Installation Commanders should incorporate local guidance to prevent conflicts and confusion. 2.2.  Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles. 2.2.1.  AFI  31-101,  Integrated  Defense,  AFI  31-118,  Security  Forces  Standards  and Procedures  and  AFI  10-245,  Antiterrorism,  require  Installation  Commanders  to  develop instructions  and  guidance  that  detail  stop,  inspection,  search  and  impoundment  of  motor vehicles  at  CONUS  installation  entry  gates,  to  include  Air  Force  restricted  and  controlled areas. 2.2.2.  MAJCOMs  responsible  for  overseas  military  installations  must  provide  their Installation  Commanders  with  written  guidelines  governing  stop,  inspection,  search  and impoundment of vehicles. This guidance reflects host nation agreements and is reviewed for legal  sufficiency.  Note:  A combatant  commander or those  commanding  unified forces may direct  guidance  covering  all  installations  under  their  command.  In  this  case,  MAJCOMs review those policies before issuing their guidance. 2.3.  Implied  Consent  to  Blood,  Breath  or  Urine  Tests.  This requirement will be outlined as part of installation newcomers briefings and/or in-processing of newly assigned personnel. Refer to AFI 31-218 (I) for specific information. 2.4.  Implied  Consent  to  Vehicle  Impoundment.  In  addition  to  those  conditions  for impoundment  listed  in  AFI  31-218(I),  paragraph  2-3,  local  situations  may  arise  that  require impoundment.  The  determination  is  made  by  the  Installation  Commander  or  designee Commanders  must  include  the  consequences  of  abandoning  personal  property  during  unit familiarization  and  indoctrination  training  (T-3).  Additionally,  commanders  must  ensure measures  are  established  to  ensure  personal  effects  are  cleared  prior  to  personnel  departing  on permanent change-of-station orders. 2.5.  Suspension  or  Revocation  of  Driving  Privileges.  Installation  Commanders  must incorporate  procedures  governing  suspension  and  revocation  in  base  publications  or  as  a supplement to this instruction. (T-2). Make these known to the base population. AF will follow the administrative due process for suspensions detailed in AFI 31-218(I). (T-3). 2.5.1.  Suspensions. 2.5.1.1.  Installation Commanders determine suspension and revocation guidance for non- moving  violations,  as  well  as  what  constitutes  a  non-moving  violation  on  their installation (e.g., performing unauthorized repairs; failure to register and insure vehicles; unauthorized modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc.).  4 AFMAN31-116  18 DECEMBER 2015 2.1.1.1.  Make  these  standards  part  of  the  local  installation  traffic  code  and  take reasonable steps to make them known to the general public. 2.5.1.2.  Persons  under  the  age  of  21,  when  in  the  United  States  or  where  legal  alcohol consumption age is 21, operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC level standard of .01  or  higher  is  reason  for  automatic  suspension.  Refer  to  AFI  31-218(I)  2-4.a.(3).(a).(b).(c).(d). for additional guidance. 2.5.1.3.  The  .08  blood  alcohol  limit  for  presumptive  intoxication  determination  may  be reduced to reflect a more stringent local, state or host nation standard. 2.5.1.4.  Installation Commanders may impose multiple suspensions to run consecutively or concurrently. 2.5.2.  Revocation. 2.5.2.1.  The  Installation  Commander  may  immediately  revoke  driving  privileges  for  a period of not  less than 1  year when a serious incident  involving a motor vehicle occurs and the Installation Commander determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is necessary to preserve public safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel. 2.5.2.2.  The DFC develops plans and procedures to forward revocation, suspension and driving  records  to  gaining  commanders  and  to  initiate  appropriate  staff  action  when receiving similar records from losing commanders of inbound personnel. 2.6.  Alcohol  and  Drug  Abuse  Programs.  After coordination with  the SJA, unit commanders will  direct  drug  and/or  alcohol  testing  within  24  hours  of  suspected  alcohol  related  motor vehicle/traffic incidents or misconduct, episodes of aberrant or bizarre behavior or where there is reasonable suspicion  of  drug use and the member refuses to  provide consent  for testing.  (T-2). Commanders are also encouraged to ensure Blood Alcohol Tests (BAT) are taken as soon after the  incident  as  possible  to  determine  the  level  and  intensity  of  alcohol  involvement.  For additional information refer to AFI 31-218(I).  AFMAN31-116  18 DECEMBER 2015 5 Chapter 3 PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLE OPERATION REQUIREMENTS 3.1.  General.  The  Installation  Commander  will  identify  requirements  to  operate  a  motor vehicle on the installation. (T-2). 3.2.  Motorcycles,  Motor  Scooters  and  Mopeds.  Refer  to  AFI  91-207,  The  US  Air  Force Traffic Safety Program, for requirements to operate motorcycles, motor scooters and mopeds on AF installations. Refer to AFI 91-207, para 4.4., for motorcycle training requirements. 3.3.  AF Form 75,  Visitor/Vehicle Pass. The Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS), the Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS) generated vehicle/visitor passes or  the  AF  Form  75  as  methods  to  control  and  identify  personnel  and  vehicles  on  a  temporary basis.  Specific  procedures  can  be  found  in  AFI  31-118  and  AFMAN  31-113,  Installation Perimeter Access Control (FOUO), when implemented. 3.4.  Handicapped  Person  Identification.  Honor  local  and  state-issued  handicap  decals, placards,  signs,  etc,  on  all  Air  Force  installations.  Upon  request  from  a  medical  practitioner, Installation Commanders may authorize issue of a locally devised card or form in OCONUS or deployed  locations  where  decals  are  not  issued.  Locally  devised  decals  contain  an  issue  and expiration date and be issued and displayed per local procedures. 3.5.  Vehicle  Registration  at  non  Air  Force  Installations.  Personnel  who  live  or  work  on  a DoD installation or who often use the facilities therein, may be required to register and be issued a DD Form 2220, Vehicle Decal, for their vehicles at those locations. 3.6.  Vehicle  Registration  at  Air  Force  Installations.  Personnel  who  possess  appropriate credentials  to  access  Air  Force  Installations  do  not  require  a  DD  Form  2220  for  Air  Force installation access. The Air Force no longer issues the DD Form 2220. (T-3).  6 AFMAN31-116  18 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 4 TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES 4.1.  Installation Traffic Codes. 4.1.1.  Restraint systems. 4.1.1.1.  Require the use of child safety seats consistent with state, territory or host nation laws. If there is no state, territory or host nation law, all children under 4 years of age or less than 50 pounds regardless of age are to be properly secured in  an appropriate child restraint system. Children ages 4 through 7, weighing 50 pounds or more and less than 4 feet  9  inches  in  height  are  to  be  properly  secured  in  a  booster  seat  or  other  appropriate child  restraint  system.  Children  ages  8  and  above  and  no  less  than  4  feet  9  inches  in height will be properly secured in a vehicle seat belt or booster seat. The child safety seat or  booster  seat  must  be  certified  by  the  manufacturer  to  meet  all  applicable  Federal performance  standards  or  host  nation  requirements  and  installed  in  accordance  with  the manufacturer’s instructions. 4.1.1.2.  Commanders  will  ensure  all  drivers  and  passengers  on  Air  Force  installations wear seat belts, or in the case of infants, be properly restrained. (T-1). 4.1.2.  Radar  Detection  Devices.  The  use  and/or  display  of  radar  or  laser  detection  devices are prohibited while on Air Force installations. 4.1.3.  Off-road  vehicle  usage:  Installation  Commanders  or  their  designee  determines  if, when and where off-road vehicles may be operated on base. In many areas, the operation of off-road vehicles is unregulated while other jurisdictions have strict requirements concerning age, safety training and vehicle equipment. Safety practices such as reflective vests, gloves, headlights, turn signals and goggles may not apply when operating off road in a recreational capacity.  Off-road  operators  will  ensure  full  compliance  with  requirements  specified  in AFI91-207,  local,  state  or  host  nation  requirements.  If  no  requirements  are  listed  as  a minimum  manufacturers recommendations for PPE will be worn. When necessary, develop additional procedures and guidance locally and publish in the installation traffic safety plan or supplement to this instruction. Ensure environmental considerations are reviewed prior to designating any off-road vehicle use area. 4.1.4.  Off-road  vehicles  used  in  on  and  off-road  environments  for  perimeter  patrols  and other tactical operations may not meet “on-street” safety requirements. This includes, but is not limited to turn signals and street tires. Instances in which turn signals  are not available, SF personnel will apply hand and arm signals or other procedures commensurate with State or local traffic code 4.2.  Traffic Accident Investigation. 4.2.1.  A major traffic accident is any accident involving a fatality, injury or property damage above the amount established by Installation Commanders. Installation Commanders may set differing  amounts  for  government  versus  private  vehicle  and  property  damage.  Monetary damage  amounts  for  major  accidents  are  typically  $10,000.  The  investigation  of  major accidents  should  be  accomplished  by  a  trained  accident  investigator.  A  trained  accident  AFMAN31-116  18 DECEMBER 2015 7 investigator is one who has completed the Traffic Management and Collision Investigations course/L8AZR3P071 0T0B 4.2.2.  Generally, a detailed accident investigation includes, but is not limited to, an AF Form 1315,  Accident  Report,  field  sketch,  scale  diagram  (if  death  or  serious  bodily  harm),  and accident narrative. 4.3.  Traffic Accident Investigation Reports. 4.3.1.  Military  members  will  report  information  to  Security  Forces  if  they  are  on/off  base resulting  in  accidents  involving  injuries  or  damage  to  military  property.  Local  guidance captures  procedures  to  accomplish  these  notifications  and  the  timeframes  to  report. Installation Commanders determine what agencies to notify and for what type of accidents to notify them. The DFC must develop a local notification matrix or other procedures to ensure proper  notification  of  appropriate  base  and  civilian  agencies  are  conducted.  (T-3).  Develop and publish these notification procedures locally. 4.3.2.  Security Forces will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident information of military affiliated personnel. (T-3). Record the information in the Security Forces blotter, along with the associated case number from the investigating police agency. When possible, Security  Forces  Reports  and  Analysis  (S5R)  will  obtain  copies  of  major  accident  reports prepared by investigating civilian police agencies to accompany off-base accident reporting information. (T-3). 4.3.3.  Security  Forces  respond  to  all  on-base  vehicle  accidents  (unless  local  conditions  or policies prohibit) to accomplish the following: 4.3.3.1.  Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance. 4.3.3.2.  Protect personal property. 4.3.3.3.  Normalize traffic. 4.3.3.4.  Identify witnesses and personnel involved. 4.3.3.5.  Conduct a formal investigation. 4.3.3.6.  The  DFC  (with  Installation  Commander  approval)  will  develop  local  response and  investigative  procedures  for  various  types  of  accidents  to  include  minor  vehicle accidents. (T-3). S/He may delegate this authority to on-duty Security Forces supervisory personnel. 4.3.4.  Record  accident  information  in  the  Security  Forces  blotter.  This  information  should include  the  accident  type,  time  and  date,  location,  name(s)  of  vehicle  operator(s),  unit  (or address  when  civilian  not  affiliated  with  military),  vehicle  description  and  license number(s)/plate. Also, include a brief summary of any damage and circumstances behind or causing the accident, as well as any traffic citations issued. 4.3.5.  Investigation conducted by Security Forces and/or AFOSI of any traffic accident takes precedence  over  any  other  types  of  investigations  relating  to  the  accident.  (Example:  Any safety  related  investigation  and/or  any  other  investigation  that  may  hamper  accident investigation practices by Security Forces and/or AFOSI.)    8 4.4.  Parking. AFMAN31-116  18 DECEMBER 2015 4.4.1.  Reserved Parking. Installation Commanders determine reserved parking guidance for their  installations.  Number  of  available  spaces,  facility  design  and  layout,  traffic  flow  and number  of  vehicles  using  facilities  help  determine  the  number  and  location  of  reserved parking  spaces.  Establish  guidance  governing  reserved  parking  a  part  of  the  installation supplement to this instruction, separate traffic control instruction or installation-parking plan. The publication addresses approval, issue, control and review of reserved parking and should give  special  consideration  to  bicycle,  motorcycle,  visitor,  Gold  Star  families  and  car  pool parking.  Consideration  should  also  be  given  to  labor  and  management  contracts  when designating parking. Handicap parking is regulated under the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards  and  applies  to  all  Air  Force  installations.  To  ensure  the  most  efficient  use  of available parking spaces, reserved parking spaces should be kept to a minimum. 4.4.2.  Use  distinctive  emblems,  decals,  stickers,  etc.,  to  control  parking  space  assignments and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. The Installation Commanders may develop guidance  concerning  the  issue  and  control  of  the  identification  media  discussed  above. Designation of parking spaces by name,  grade, rank or title should be avoided due to  force protection concerns. 4.4.3.  Installations  may  create  a  parking  wardens  program  to  monitor  and  cite  parking violators at their facilities. 4.4.3.1.  If utilized, installations develop a local publication to supplement/implement this instruction  addressing  the  parking  warden  program.  The  supplement  includes  a requirement for individual unit commanders to designate a minimum of one primary and alternate  at  the  grade  of  E-5  or  civilian  equivalent,  in  writing.  All  monitors  will  issue parking tickets on the DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket. (T-3). S5R obtains a letter with the current monitors and maintain the letter on file. 4.4.3.2.  Monitors  are  trained  by  the  Security  Forces  unit  on  the  correct  procedures  to complete  tickets,  including  the  routing  process  of  issued  tickets  to  S5R.  The  main difference between a DD Form 1408 issued by a Security Forces member and one by a parking monitor is the special instructions on the back of the pink copy that instructs the violator  to  contact  the  monitor  within  24  hours  or  next  duty  day  who  issued  the  ticket instead of Security Forces. Monitors will provide contact information on parking tickets to enable violators to provide information necessary to complete citation. (T-3). 4.5.  Off-installation Traffic Activities.  The DFC must develop procedures for the sharing and exchanging  of  information  with  civil  authorities.  (T-3).  Local  procedures  cover  the  receiving, processing and securing of traffic and related incident reports received from other investigative agencies.  Unit  commanders  are  notified  when  personnel  under  their  authority  are  involved  in serious off-base incidents (e.g., major accidents, DUI, hit and run, etc).  AFMAN31-116  18 DECEMBER 2015 9 Chapter 5 DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM 5.1.  Driving  Records.  Use  SFMIS  to  record  vehicle  traffic  accidents,  moving  and  parking violations, suspension or revocation actions and traffic point assessments involving military and DoD civilian personnel, their family members and other personnel operating motor vehicles on a military installation. Units will identify alternate procedures when SFMIS is unavailable. . 5.1.1.  Identify  individuals  who  are  principals  in  a  motor  vehicle  accident  as  “Driver  1” subject or “Driver 2” victim. 5.1.2.  Identify accidents appropriately with “MVA” minor vehicle accident; (MJVA) major vehicle  accident;  “NLD”  no  liability  determined;  “PD”  property  damage;  “PI”  personal injury; “G” government; “P” private; “V” vehicle; and “FO” fixed object. Table 5.1.  Point Assessment for Moving Violations. Violation Points Assessed Reference paragraph 4.1.1.1. See note #1. Operating a radar detection device to indicate the presence of speed recording instruments or to transmit simulated erroneous speed (prohibited on DoD installations). See note #2.

Applies to not using or when child restraint system is improperly installed, e.g., car  seat, infant carrier, booster seat, belt/strap modification (when required by manufacturer),  etc. Assess four points when no restraint system of any kind is used. 2. When violation occurs within an active school zone, add 1 point to point assessment. 3. Installation Commanders may suspend driving privileges for 1st and subsequent offense.      10 AFMAN31-116  18 DECEMBER 2015 Table 5.2.  Point Assessment for Non-Moving Violations (See Note 1). Violation Points Assessed Unattended Child under 12 years of age left in vehicle. Animals are included if a danger exists to the animal. See note #4. Improper Registration (fraudulent tags). Misuse of handicap decal. See note #2. Illegally parked in designated handicap area (no decal, license or placard displayed). Unattended Vehicle (while running). Abandoned Vehicle. Improper Parking. See note #3. Improper Registration (expired or unregistered). NOTES: 6 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1. When two or more violations are committed on a single occasion, points may be assessed for each violation. 2. When a vehicle has a handicap decal displayed, but the occupant is not the decal or placard registrant and is not dropping off or picking up the handicapped registrant. Also includes parking in an area designated for “Van” access only, and handicap registrant has parked another vehicle class instead. 3. When designated in local parking plan (e.g.., double parked, parked in reserved parking,  against the flow of traffic and those areas designated for emergency vehicles). 4. When an AF Form 3545 is also accomplished. Revocation of driving privileges for one year is considered by the commander. Example: If children or animals were left in dangerous conditions in vehicle, e.g.., in hot weather where interior temperatures may reach dangerous levels, keys left accessible to children or where conditions are deemed hazardous by a reasonable person. 5. Emergency vehicles are authorized to park in any area deemed necessary to affect a response. 5.2.  Point System Procedures. 5.2.1.  Distribute citation copies and process IAW AFMAN 31-120, Security Forces Systems and Administration. 5.2.2.  Installation Commanders may suspend or revoke driving privileges as provided by this instruction regardless of whether the improvement measures identified in AFI 31-218(I) are accomplished.  AFMAN31-116  18 DECEMBER 2015 11 Chapter 6 IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES 6.1.  Standards  for  Impoundment.  The  on-duty  SF  Flight  Chief,  or  above,  will  determine when the vehicle is driven or moved without owner’s consent if the owner cannot be contacted or the owner refuses and conditions in AFI 31-218(I) are present. (T-3). 6.2.  Procedures for Impoundment.  At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government agencies  may  request  the  Air  Force  impound  an  on-base  vehicle  for  reasons  not  related  to military  issues.  Staff  such  requests  through  the  SJA  and  DFC.  When  appropriate,  comply  and support  such  requests  and  impound  the  vehicle  for  a  reasonable  period.  Release  the  vehicle  if civil authorities do not take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period as determined by Installation Commanders. 6.3.  Disposition  of  Vehicles  After  Impoundment.  Impoundment and disposition of privately owned  vehicles  is  a  high-risk  process.  It  is  imperative  an  installation  have  a  detailed  plan  to: Ensure wide publicity of base impoundment rules; have a process to provide reasonable notice of impoundment and an opportunity to reclaim a vehicle; conduct a review of proposed disposal by appropriate base offices, to include the SJA, prior to taking action; and a process to obtain retail records  of  these  actions  in  the  event  of  litigation  or  high-level  inquiry.  Further  information  on impoundment can be found in AFI 31-218(I).  JOHN B.
