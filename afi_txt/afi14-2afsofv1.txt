General.  This volume outlines the basic policy and guidance for training Air Force Special Operations Forces (AFSOF) unit 14N and 1N0 intelligence personnel.  This instruction does not apply to 724 STG or 6 SOS personnel.  1N2 and 1N1 personnel should follow Headquarters Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC)/A2 approved, unit developed, Initial Qualification Training  (IQT)/MQT/CT  training  programs,  unless  those  personnel  are  performing  duties associated  with  the  requirements  listed  in  this  instruction.    It  establishes  training  procedures necessary  to  provide  skilled  and  qualified  support  to  AFSOF  unit  operations.    Unit-level guidance may expand upon the basic procedures contained in this AFI, but in no case will it be less restrictive. 1.2.  References.  The  primary  references  for  AFSOF  unit  intelligence  training  are  AFI  14-2AFSOF, Volume 2, AFSOF Unit Intelligence Evaluation Criteria; AFI 14-2AFSOF, Volume 3, AFSOF Unit Intelligence Procedures; Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-1,  Threat  Guide,  Threat  Reference  Guide  and  Countertactics  Manual,  and  this  instruction.  Ensure training reflects current edition of these publications.  As appropriate, supplement these references  with  other  classified  and  unclassified  publications  such  as  National  Air  and  Space Intelligence  products,  Tactics  Bulletins,  Tactics  Analysis  Reports,  Country  Studies,  etc.  References should be placed in the appropriate training lesson. 1.3.  Waivers.  MAJCOM/A2s will courtesy-copy AFSOC/A2 regarding all waiver requests and responses.AFSOC   AFSOC/A2  will  notify  AF/A2DF  of  significant  trends  in  waiver correspondence  if  such  correspondence  indicates  the  need  to  readdress  existing  policy  and guidance. 1.4.  Responsibilities. 1.4.1.  AFSOC/A2 Duties. 1.4.1.1.  Provide oversight of unit training material development for Initial Qualification Training (IQT), Mission Qualification Training (MQT), Continuation Training (CT), and Specialized Training (ST). 1.4.1.2.  In  coordination  with  other  organizations  develop/maintain  and  provide requirements for the creation of a training standard, course syllabus and curriculum for IQT for AFSOF intelligence through biennial formal course reviews IAW AFI 14-202V1. 1.4.1.3.  Chair  a  training  working  group  biannually  to  review  this  instruction,  AFSOF unit  intelligence  training  requirements  and  programs  for  AFSOF.    Working  group participants  include  active  and  reserve  component  representatives  from  each  AFSOF intelligence unit. 1.4.1.4.  Coordinate formal training requirements to meet unit taskings. 1.4.1.4.1.  Formal  School  Courses.    Formal  schools  or  courses  provide  mission-essential  training  that  cannot  be  attained  through  IQT,  MQT,  On-the-Job  Training (OJT), etc.  Formal training includes joint, national, theater, or service courses and can  be  achieved  in  residence,  online,  or  through  mobile  training  teams.    Senior Intelligence Officers (SIOs) review duty position-specific training requirements and AFI14-2AFSOFV1  23 DECEMBER 2014   5  determine if a specific formal training course meets some/all of those requirements.  SIOs develop short (1-2  years)  and long-range (3-5  years) training plans to project when unit personnel attend formal courses along with other required training. 1.4.1.4.1.1.  AFSOC/A2F  Responsibilities.    AFSOC/A2F  is  responsible  for managing the MAJCOM formal intelligence training program. 1.4.1.4.1.1.1.  Annual  Screening  for  Formal  Training  Requirements.    Each calendar year, usually during the third quarter, AFSOC/A2FMT should send a data  call  for  all  units  to  initiate  an  annual  screening  of  Air  Force  formal training requirements also known as mission readiness training (MRT).  MRT is prioritized according to the training level of urgency.  The levels of urgency are divided into level 1 and level 2.  Level 1 refers to mission accomplishment training  and  is  defined  as  training  necessary  to  accomplish  the  day-to-day mission.    Unit  SIOs  validate  level  1  training  as  mission  essential  thereby authorizing unit funds for these courses if funding is not available from other means (e.g. AETC-funded).  Level 2 is mission enhancement training and is defined as training required to improve mission  capability.  The urgency of training  requested  should  be  directly  connected  to  the  impact  on  the  unit’s mission. 1.4.1.4.1.1.2.  Upon  receiving  the  AF  MRT  annual  screening  notification, include  subordinate SIOs  should  consider  all  unit  requirements, squadrons/dets,  and  consolidate  and  submit  course to AFSOC/A2FMT.  ANG and AFRC units submit requirements through their command  training  request  process.    Unit  requirements  should  be  submitted using AF Form 3933, MAJCOM MRT Request Form, as required.  MRT funds are  limited  and  SIOs  must  carefully  review  and  validate  each  training requirement.  (T-3).  AFRC units will adhere to AFRC established timelines and processes for requesting formal school quotas.  AFSOC/A2 inputs IMA training requirements to aligned RIO Det for processing with HQ AFRC.  (T-2) 1.4.1.4.1.1.3.  Prior to each new fiscal year (FY), AFSOC/A2FMT receives its allocated  quotas  for  each  course  from  AFSOC/A1KE.    It  is  not  unusual  to experience a reduction in allocations received versus quotas requested.  This is normally  the  result  of  fewer  allocations  being  levied  to  the  command.  AFSOC/A2FMT should notify each unit of the allocation breakout for each MRT course.  It is incumbent upon the units to review this breakout for the requirements they submitted during the screening process.  If a conflict arises over a quota, adjudication as to which unit receives it may be based on the units’ history of quota utilization, so it is imperative that units fill the quotas they request. requirements to 1.4.1.4.1.2.  Scheduling  Formal  Courses.    Units  provide  AFSOC/A2FMT  with projected attendee’s name, rank, and SSAN 90 days prior to the course start date (CSD).    Name  changes  may  be  made  up  to  45  days  prior  to  CSD.    Units  that cannot provide an attendee within the 90-day window should turn in the quota to AFSOC/A2FMT for reallocation.  All prerequisites for attendance at any formal   6  AFI14-2AFSOFV1  23 DECEMBER 2014 school  should  be  completed  NLT  60  days  prior  to  CSD.    If  a  member  fails  to attend  training,  units  provide  an  explanation  to  AFSOC/A2F  detailing  why  the person  did  not  attend  and  the  corrective  actions  taken  to  preclude  future  no-shows.  AFSOC/A2FMT is the waiver authority for the established timelines. (T-3) 1.4.1.4.2.  AFSOC/A2S,  numbered  air  forces  (NAF)  and  units  establish,  maintain, and document a continuing security education and training program for all assigned intelligence personnel and other personnel assigned to any intelligence organization.
