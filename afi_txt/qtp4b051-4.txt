What is the aim of a routine assessment?   ANSWERS A:  Routine assessments are designed to be short-duration, and identify/prioritize the need for a more in-depth (special) assessment. The information collected during a routine assessment is used to focus limited resources in a prioritized manner   (Source: AFI 48-145, Occupational and Environmental Health Program).   2.  After the initial step of defining the scope of support and resources required to assess industrial activities, routine assessments continue with what step?   A:  Basic characterization   (Source: AFI 48-145, Occupational and Environmental Health Program). 3.  Before conducting the opening conference, what must you do to gain a working knowledge of the shop activities, compliance requirements, and health risks?   A:  Review previous assessments  (Source: AFI 48-145, Occupational and Environmental Health Program). 4.  For each hazard, what two factors are combined to determine the uncertainty rating?  A:  Confidence in hazard and exposure characterization and confidence in existing controls   (Source: AFMAN 48-146, Occupational and Environmental Health Program Management, para 2.4.7).  5.  What would the level of confidence in hazard characterization be if during your routine assessment initial air sampling results were within acceptable limits, but not totally conclusive?
