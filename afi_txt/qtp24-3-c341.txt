If equipped with air brakes, perform a function check.  Air brake safety devices vary.  For safety purposes, in areas where an incline is present, you will use wheel chocks during the air brake check.  The proper procedures for inspecting the air brake system are as follows:   5.2.3.4.1.   With the air pressure built up to governor cutoff (120 – 140 psi), shut off the engine, chock your wheels if necessary, release the parking brake (all vehicles), and fully apply the foot brake.  Hold the foot brake for one minute.  Check the air gauge to see if the air pressure drops more than three pounds in one minute.  5.2.3.4.2.   Without re-starting the engine, turn electrical power to the “on” or “battery charge” position.  Begin fanning off the air pressure by rapidly applying and releasing the foot brake.  Low air warning devices (buzzer, light, flag) should activate before air pressure drops below 60 psi or level specified by the manufacturer. 5.2.3.4.3.   Continue to fan off the air pressure.  The parking brake valve should close (pop out).  5.2.3.5.  Sign AF Form 1800.  Verify SF 91, Motor Vehicle Accident Report and DD Form 518, Accident Identification Card are on-hand.  5.2.3.6.  Post-operation inspection.  5.2.3.6.1.   Check fuel level (< ¾ tank, refuel).  5.2.3.6.2.   Check diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) level (< ¾ tank, refill) (if equipped).  5.2.3.6.3.   Ensure vehicle and components are cleaned.  5.2.3.6.4.   Park vehicle.  Ensure transmission in neutral, apply parking brake.  5.2.3.6.5.   Follow manufacturer’s shut-down procedures.  5.2.3.6.6.   Shut off lights and accessories.  5.2.3.6.7.   Drain air tanks. 5.2.3.6.8.   Post 360 walk-around.  Check for leaks and damage.  5.3. Vehicle Safety and Equipment.  5.3.1.

Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) = Truck Weight + Tools + Cargo Weight.  CAUTION – Do NOT exceed the Gross Vehicle Weight of the dump.  5.3.1.3.  Plan your route.  5.3.1.3.1.   Overhead clearance.  Check the clearance height of the vehicle relative to the  overhead  obstructions  such  as  power  lines,  trees,  and  bridges  (especially  when raising the bed).  For minimum allowable distances between equipment and electrical transmission line(s), consult 29 CFR 1411(b) (5) (i), Table T. CAUTION – If you do come into contact with overhead power lines, remain in the vehicle.  Have someone contact exterior electric and the fire department immediately.  5.3.1.3.2.

AF Form 1800, SF 91 and DD Form 518.  5.4.1.1.1.   Turn  all  radio  equipment  off  before  starting  the  engine.    A  power  surge might occur and damage the radio.  5.4.1.1.2.   Turn off engine if any instrument readings are not normal.  Failure to do so may result in engine damage.  5.4.1.1.3.   Do not operate the vehicle is there are indications that it has been operated with less than 50% of its oil capacity.  5.4.1.1.4.   Any  unusual  vehicle  noises  should  be  inspected  and  cleared  by  an experienced vehicle maintenance technician.  5.4.1.1.5.   Ensure the driving light switch is in the “Stop Light” position as a minimum when operating the vehicle.  In the “Off” position, all service lights are inoperative.  5.4.1.1.6. Inspect and adjust seat belt straps.  Remove slack from belt when worn.  Seat belts have non-locking retractors. Injury may result if not used and adjusted properly.    5.4. Driving Safety and Precautions.  5.4.1.  Mobile command vehicle operations.  5.4.1.1.  Safe operation.  5.4.1.1.7.   When parking on a grade, apply the parking brake and choke the tires. Be sure to turn off all light switches to prevent the batteries from discharging when not in use.   5.4.1.2.  Over the road operation.     5.4.1.2.1.   Greater  vehicle  weight.    The  operator  needs  to  consider  the  combined weight of the mobile command vehicle and the load.  This will affect the following: 5.4.1.2.1.1.  Operator’s ability to stop.  Do not tailgate the vehicle in front.  Allow more distance between vehicles in order to increase reaction time.  5.4.1.2.1.2.  Vehicle’s ability to accelerate/follow the flow of traffic.  Accelerate smoothly  and  gradually  so  the  truck  does  not  jerk.    Rough  acceleration  causes unnecessary, premature mechanical damage to the truck’s drive train.  Maintain a safe speed. 5.4.1.2.2.   Downgrades/upgrades.  The operator will use lower gears more frequently to climb hills or mountains with increasing grade steepness, length and/or heavy load weight.  Plan ahead to identify downgrades/upgrades on the route of travel.  If possible, talk to other drivers who are familiar with the grades to find out what speeds are safe.  When  encountering  downgrades/upgrades  as  described,  the  operator  will  need  to address: 5.4.1.2.2.1.  Speed.    On  downgrades  gravity  causes  the  speed  of  the  vehicle  to increase.  The operator must select an appropriate safe speed, use a low gear, and proper backing techniques.  The operator must go slow enough so as to not overheat the truck brakes.  5.4.1.2.2.2.  Stopping.  If the brakes become too hot, they may start to “fade”.  This means  the  operator  will  need  to  apply  the  brakes  harder  and  harder  to  acquire equivalent stopping power.  5.4.1.2.3.   Sharp turns.  Slow down before entering the turn.  During the turn, avoid sharp sudden movements with the steering wheel.  This reduces the chance of shifting the load in the tank, and also prevents the possibility of tipping over due to the higher center of gravity.  5.4.1.2.4.   Surroundings.  Operating a mobile command vehicle requires the operator’s constant attention.  Many situations can be avoided by simply paying close attention to the surrounding conditions.  Road signs such as “steep Grade”, “low clearance”, “sharp turn ahead”, and special speed limits are posted for the driver’s safety.  5.4.2.  Backing.  5.4.2.1.  Always use a trained spotter and hand signals.  CAUTION – Do not depend solely on the vehicle’s “Back-up” camera to back the vehicle.  A spotter is still required.  5.4.2.2.  Back slowly and keep the spotter in view at all times.  If the operator loses sight of the spotter, the operator must immediately stop the vehicle.  5.4.2.3.  See AFMAN 24-306 for standard AF spotter hand signals and additional guidance on spotter safety.  5.4.3.  Tire changing safety.  5.4.3.1.  Consider where the vehicle is located.  If on a bridge, curve, road with no shoulder, etc.; it is safer to move a vehicle on a flat tire to a safe location.  5.4.3.2.  Find a location with a firm and level surface for the jack and jack stand.  5.4.3.3.  Turn on the four-way flashers.  5.4.3.4.  Set parking brake.  5.4.3.5.  Place warning triangles or flares.  5.4.3.6.  Block the wheels.  If changing a front tire, block the rear wheels.  If changing a rear tire, block the front wheels.  5.4.3.7.  As required, place dunnage or cribbage under the jack and/or jack stand.  CAUTION  –  Notify  VCO/VCNCO,  your  supervisor,  and/or  vehicle  maintenance  if  split  rim requires servicing.  5.5. Vehicle Operation.  5.5.1.  General vehicle operations.  5.5.1.1.  Complete a pre-operation vehicle inspection.  5.5.1.2.  Sign the current AF Form 1800.  5.5.1.3.  Climb into the vehicle.  Use three points of contact.  5.5.1.4.  Adjust the seat and mirrors as needed; fasten seat belt.  5.5.2.  Starting the mobile command vehicle.  5.5.2.1.
