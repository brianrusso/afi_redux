Attachment: Guidance Changes   ANTHONY J. ROCK Lieutenant General, USAF The Inspector General                         Guidance Changes  (Change) Table of Contents Attachment 6 to read “INSPECTION MESSAGES, GUIDES, AND REPORT RECIPIENTS”  (Change) Table of Contents to add “ATTACHMENT 13 – SPECIAL ACCESS PROGRAMS (SAP) INSPECTIONS”  (Change) paragraph 1.5.11.12 to read “SAVs are conducted by MAJCOM, HAF Functional Staffs, designated centralized activities, or functional manager-approved experts only at the request of the Wing/NAF/FOA/Center/DRU/MAJCOM Commander. Commanders may also request assistance visits from other wings/experts, as desired. SAVs may help a unit better understand the intent of higher headquarters policy and allow Functional staffs an opportunity to provide training to the unit. SAVs help MAJCOMs and HAF Functional staffs identify potential resource constraints, develop accurate guidance/policy and inform the RBSS. MFMs will coordinate all SAVs with the MAJCOM Gatekeeper. For ANG units, ANG/IG is the Gatekeeper; all SAV requests will be sent to ANG/IG for processing. (T-2) SAVs will not be given a rating and are not intended to be used as a tool to prepare a unit for a formal IG inspection. (T-1)  MAJCOM IGs will not treat SAVs as official inspection results.   At the discretion and direction of the Commander, Wing IGs will ensure all SAV observations and results identified as deficiencies are documented in IGEMS and crosschecked with MICT as part of the Commander’s Inspection Program.  (T-3) Corrective actions will be highlighted in the CIMB to ensure commanders have visibility on deficiencies and are able to track to resolution. (T-3)”  (Delete) paragraph 1.5.15.  (Change) paragraph 1.6.3.1 to read “Wing Safety will participate with the WIT whenever possible; however, the Safety staff, IAW established safety processes, is permitted to conduct annual workplace/facility inspections and unit safety assessments independent of the WIT.

(T-1) This report is available to the IG office through the unit inspected. The Wing Safety office will coordinate annual inspection/assessment schedules with the Gatekeeper for deconfliction with Wing calendar events. (T-1)”  (Change) paragraph 1.6.3.2 to read “The Wing IG will request Safety SMEs and the Chief of Safety will ensure Safety SMEs are available to assist with exercise scenario development and throughout the execution and debrief phases of the exercise. (T-3) Safety will provide the IG in writing any noted safety discrepancies for inclusion in the IG report; the IG will enter all validated deficiencies into IGEMS. (T-1) In accordance with Safety protocol, coordination with the Safety Office that validated the deficiency is required prior to closing out a Safety deficiency. (T-1)”  (Change) paragraph 2.4.1.3.1 to read “There may be non-IG organizations within the wing that are explicitly authorized to inspect on behalf of the commander outside of an IG activity and not    inspected by the WIT due to specific inspector requirements and/or commander’s intent (i.e., Safety). In these cases, the non-IG inspectors will coordinate requirements with the Gatekeeper. (T-1) The non-IG inspectors will provide their report to the appropriate commander and the report will be available to the IG through the unit inspected/assessed. (T-1) The IG and the non-IG inspection team chief will collaborate and determine the appropriate deficiencies to enter into IGEMS. (T-1)”  (Delete) paragraph 2.4.3.1.3.1.

Air Force Installation Mission Assurance Exercise Requirements    (Change) paragraph 6.5 to read “Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI). An NSI assesses a unit’s ability to accomplish its assigned nuclear weapons mission and produce reliable nuclear weapons in a safe and secure environment in compliance with applicable directives. Additionally, an NSI inspects a unit’s capability to safely and reliably receive, store, secure, assemble, transport, maintain, load, mate, lock/unlock, test, render safe and employ nuclear weapons. Missile launch crews, aircrews, command post controllers and release teams must demonstrate (through performance-based assessments, testing, etc.) their knowledge of weapon acceptance procedures (unless evaluated and documented elsewhere during the UEI), nuclear weapon system safety rules, and nuclear weapon control order handling and authentication procedures. MAJCOMs will assign overall unit ratings and MGA adjectival ratings as specified in CJCSI 3263.05B for NWTIs. In order to meet Oversight and Core Team responsibilities, MAJCOM IGs will notify the AFIA/NI at least 60 calendar days prior to inspection execution. MAJCOM IGs will notify Nuclear Enterprise agencies of the inspection conclusion using Attachment 6.”  (Change) paragraph 6.7.1 to read “Non-surety deficiencies. If non-surety deficiencies are discovered during an NSI, the inspection team chief will brief the inspected unit commander of the findings and document via the MAJCOM's UEI continual evaluation reporting mechanism.  In general, deficiencies are categorized as non-surety if the deficiency's referenced policy is neither a primary nuclear policy document, a supplement to a primary nuclear policy document or referenced within a primary nuclear policy document. For example, a deficiency against the Wing IG for failing to comply with AFI 90-201, would typically be considered a non-surety deficiency. However, a deficiency against DODS5210.41_AFMAN31-108 or a MAJCOM supplement to DODS5210.41_AFMAN31-108 would typically be considered surety related and categorized in    the Security MGA.  The IG Team Chief will make the final determination of whether a deficiency is surety or non-surety.”  (Change) paragraph 6.10.1 to read “Nuclear Control Order Procedures (NCOP). Evaluate command post, aircrew, Permissive Action Link/Code Management System lock/unlock teams, and missile crew responses to nuclear control orders as well as effectiveness of applicable C2 functions IAW HHQ directives.

Assessment Methodology.  NCOP proficiency will be assessed via performance-based evaluations in an operationally-realistic simulator.  If approved facilities or simulator-use decode documents are not available, assess NCOP via scenario-based written test.  Emergency Action (EA) general knowledge written testing may be utilized to supplement (but not replace) performance-based assessments.  The passing standard for general knowledge testing or scenario-based testing is 90 percent.”  (Add) “6.10.1.1.1. Bomber Aircrew.  The performance evaluation will assess (at a minimum) aircrew processing of posture, launch, execution, and termination Emergency Action Procedures (EAPs).  The evaluation will be graded as “PASS/FAIL” for aircrew taking actions that could create a Critical deficiency as identified in paragraphs 6.10.3.1. and 6.10.3.2.”   (Add) “6.10.1.1.2. DCA Aircrew.  The performance evaluation will assess (at a minimum) aircrew processing of recall and termination EAPs.

Command Post Controllers.  The evaluation will (at a minimum) consist of a performance evaluation and an EA test covering posture, launch, execution, message relay, message piecing, termination, emergency destruction and emergency evacuation procedures (as applicable).  The weighted average of Performance Evaluation (50 percent) and test (50 percent) scores will be the final score for team (E.g. 100 percent on EPE and 30 percent on test equates to a 65 percent average).  The passing standard for the averaged evaluation and testing scores is  90 percent.”  (Add) “6.10.1.1.4. Missile Combat Crews.  The assessment will (at a minimum) consist of a performance-based evaluation in the Missile Procedure Trainer (MPT), which covers preparatory actions, execution, and termination procedures.  The evaluation will be rated IAW AFGSCI 13-5301, Volume 2, Rapid Execution and Combat Targeting (REACT) Crew Standardization and Evaluation.  In the event an operational simulator is not available and an NCOP scenario-based written test is administered, MCCMs will test as a crew.”  (Add) “6.10.1.2. Assess the NCOP MGA as UNACCEPTABLE if any critical deficiencies are assessed which would create the credible possibility of compromising the safety or reliability of nuclear weapons.”     (Change) paragraph 6.10.2 to read “Use Control.  Evaluate Permissive Action Link/Code Management System, Command Disablement System, Weapons Render Safe and Continuation Procedures, Positive Enable System, Active Protection System and Emergency Destruction operations according to CJCSI 3260.01, Joint Policy Governing Positive Control Material and Devices, Joint Nuclear Weapons Publication System technical orders, and other applicable HHQ directives.”    (Change) paragraph 6.10.2.1 to read “USAFE units whose mission includes nuclear gravity weapons.

Purpose.  To provide guidance for inspecting Special Access Programs (SAPs) in order to report on the health, security and compliance of SAPs to the Secretary of the Air Force.    A13.2.  Background. SAPs are inspected to ensure adequate oversight of these highly sensitive programs and the persons charged with their proper management, administration and execution.  Inspectors utilize a standardized inspection methodology that incorporates the tenets of the AFIS in  order  to  assess  the  responsible  agency’s  ability  to  successfully  execute  SAPs.    Self-assessments  will  be  completed  annually  by  each  SAP  responsible  stakeholder  at  SAF,  HAF, MAJCOM, FOA and DRU and forwarded to SAF/IGI upon completion (NLT 31 Dec).  Results will be analyzed by SAF/IGI and appropriate recommendations will be discussed with TIG.  SAP inspections  at  the  HAF  will  be  executed  by  the  SAF/IGI  team  every  24-36  months.    Efforts should  be  made  to  align  SAP  inspections  with  scheduled  MIs  or  UEIs,  as  applicable.    The Inspector  General  may  direct  an  out  of  cycle  (limited-/no-notice)  inspection  as  necessary. Guidance in this Attachment is consistent with the AFIS and also meets expectations as outlined in  AFPD  16-7,  Special  Access  Programs  and  AFI  16-701,  Management,  Administration  and Oversight of Special Access Programs.  A13.3.  TIG  Intent.    Incorporate  HAF  SAP  inspections  into  the  AFIS  as  a distinct inspection type.    Unlike  other  inspections,  HAF  SAP  inspections  partner  with  enterprise  stakeholders  to fully  integrate  their  oversight  responsibilities  with  continual  evaluation,  self-assessments  and internal control metrics into the inspection and scheduling process.  Accuracy of HAF SAP self-assessments is critical to an effective program; data will be verified by the SAF/IGI inspection team.    The  Inspection  Team  Chief  will  be  a  SAF/IG  O-6,  GS-15  or  higher.    AFOSI  PJ  will provide a Security Inspection Lead.  The Special Access Program Central Office (SAF/AAZ) will provide  at  least  one  team  member  for  each  HAF  SAP  inspection.    Other  inspectors  will  be identified by need in advance of the inspection (see paragraph A.13.5.1.).  A13.4. Concept of HAF SAP  Operations.  SAF/IGI will coordinate with AFIA, SAF/AAZ, AFOSI  PJ  and  other  HAF  agencies  designated  by  TIG  to  develop  a  3-year  inspection plan/schedule  for  TIG’s  approval  NLT  15  December  every  year.    With  TIG’s  approval,  the schedule may be distributed to affected HAF agencies, informing them of projected inspection dates.  It is TIG’s intent that these inspections be as minimally intrusive as possible; however, HAF  staffs  should  voice  scheduling  concerns  with  SAF/IGI  as  soon  as  possible  in  order  to preclude  unnecessary  work  stoppage  due  to  regularly  scheduled  heavy  work  periods  and known key staff absences.       A13.5. Oversight Stakeholders:  Roles and Responsibilities.  A.13.5.1. For all HAF SAP inspections, SAF/HAF stakeholders with SAP oversight responsibility will:  A13.5.1.1.

The SAF/IG inspection staff will plan their activities based on the TIG-approved inspection plan.  In general, the inspection notification process occurs as follows: A13.11.1.  Approximately  10-14  calendar  days  prior  to  an  inspection,  a  notification memorandum will be sent to the affected agency with detailed instructions included to assist with pre-inspection requirements/deliverables. Although every effort will be made to give the inspected  agency 10-14 days notification of inspection, mission requirements and inspector availability may drive a much shorter notification to the affected agency.  Notifications within 10  days  must  be  closely  coordinated  between  TIG’s  inspection  staff  (SAF/IGI)  and  the inspected agency. A13.11.2. Approximately 3-4 calendar days prior to the inspection, the inspected agency will be provided with a list of inspectors to verify inspector clearance and access.  If the inspection is a directed no-notice inspection, the inspector roster will be presented upon team arrival and the inspection will commence immediately after verification of the roster. A13.12. HAF SAP Pre-inspection deliverables.  The following items will be sent via e-mail to  the  inspection  team  chief  within  five  working  days  of  receiving  the  notification  of inspection: A13.12.1.

The  inspected  program  leadership  may  provide  a concise  inbrief  (generally  limited  to  30  minutes  or  less)  to  the  inspection  team.    Once completed,  inspectors  will  coordinate  with  the  inspected  unit  leadership  to  ensure appropriate  POCs  are  available  to  assess  MGAs  and  specific  oversight  areas  such  as, program  acquisition  functions,  contract  oversight,  budget,  legal  requirements,  operations, and  security  (information  protection,  counterintelligence,  and  administration).  Inspectors will begin inspecting with the POCs from those areas provided by the inspected unit.  The inspection Team Chief will meet with internal leadership to determine any requested items to include in the inspection.  ATIS-Is should be conducted with available AF unit personnel until a sufficient number of personnel are contacted to assess appropriate inspection areas and  unit  personnel  are  afforded  an  opportunity  to  speak  with  an  accredited  inspector  if desired. A13.25.2.  The  inspection  Team  Chief  will  establish  inspection  team  meeting  times normally at the beginning of each duty day, prior to/after lunch, and near the end of each     duty day during normal working hours to gather inspection findings and ensure appropriate inspection progress and direction. A13.25.3. Overall inspection team findings will be briefed to unit leadership personnel at the end of each inspection day.  If potential significant and/or critical deficiencies are noted during  the  inspection,  the  inspection  Team  Chief  will  promptly  brief  unit  leadership personnel  on  the  deficiency  noted  so  leadership  personnel  may  begin  addressing  the deficiency.

Applicability.  Unless otherwise stated, this instruction applies to all inspections, as defined in  paragraph  1.2.2.,  conducted  on  or  by  any  United  States  Air  Force  (USAF)  organization, including  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  and  Air  Force  Reserve  (AFRC)  units,  and  those  forces assigned/apportioned to Combatant Commands. 1.2.  Overview. 1.2.1.  The Air Force Inspection System (AFIS).  The AFIS is a single coherent, integrated, and synchronized system of inspections conducted on behalf of the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF), the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) and commanders at all levels.   1.2.1.1.  Inspections are the responsibility of commanding officers and civilian directors of  military  organizations  at  the  Squadron,  Group,  Wing,  Wing-equivalent,  Field Operating Agencies (FOA), Direct Reporting Units (DRU), MAJCOM, and Headquarters Air Force (HAF) levels IAW Title 10 United States Code (USC) § 8583, Requirement of Exemplary  Conduct  and  Air  Force  Instruction  1-2,  Commander’s  Responsibilities.  Inspections  are  conducted  by  a  commander/director,  or  on  behalf  of  a commander/director,  on  his  or  her  staff  and  subordinate  units/organizations,  or  as directed  by  SAF/IG.    Inspections  are  performed  by  authorities  inside  the  inspected  unit (i.e.,  Internal  Inspections)  and  outside  the  inspected  unit  (i.e.,  External  Inspections).  Numbered Air Force (NAF) commanders should coordinate inspection requirements with their  respective  MAJCOM  commander.    As  applicable,  NAF  inspection  policy  will  be captured in the appropriate MAJCOM supplement to this Instruction. 1.2.1.2.  Inspection  is  an  inherent  function  of  command  exercised  at  every  level  to evaluate the  state  of  discipline,  economy,  efficiency,  readiness,  and  resource management.    Inspection  preparation  is  inherently  wasteful  if  not  directly  aligned  with mission  readiness.    Units  are  inspection  ready  when  commanders  focus  on  mission readiness  and  on  building  a  culture  of  disciplined  compliance  in  which  every  Airman does  his/her  job  right  the  first  time  and  when  no  one  is  looking.    The  intent  of  the Inspector General (IG) is to continuously improve the AFIS so there is an ever-shrinking difference--both real and perceived--between mission readiness and inspection readiness.  Airmen and commanders must stay focused on the mission and not the inspection.    1.2.2.  Inspection.  The  purpose  of  inspecting  is  to  improve.    An  inspection  is  any  effort  to evaluate  an  organization,  function  or  process  by  any  means  or  method,  including  surveys, interviews, assessments, evaluations, exercises and audits, excluding audits conducted under the  authority  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  Auditor  General  (SAF/AG),  and  those  audit activities  conducted  under  the  authority  of  the  Secretary  of  the  AF  Comptroller  (SAF/FM) specifically  for  the  purposes  of  achieving  audit  readiness  in  accordance  with  the  Financial Improvement  and  Audit  Readiness  Plan.    Inspections  may  also  include  special  visits, technical  evaluations,  inspections  required  by  law,  and  any  other  assessment  deemed necessary  by  the  commander.    The  exercise  of  command  responsibilities,  and  inspections approved by the Secretary of the Air Force Inspector General (SAF/IG; TIG) are conducted AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 9 by  functional  staff  (Functional)  entities  to  provide  or  obtain  technical  information  or assistance. 1.2.2.1.  Continual  evaluation  is  the  routine  monitoring  of  performance  indicators (leading  and  lagging)  from  within  the  inspected  unit.    This  includes  data  analysis  of metrics,  data  systems,  inventory  controls,  requests  for  assistance,  MICT  and/or  any reporting  system  within  the  functional  community.    MAJCOM  functional  staffs  or centralized  activities  will  be  effectively  engaged  with  units  to  identify  when  a  unit  is performing  well  or  struggling  to  meet  mission.    Continual  evaluation  in  AFIS  also provides meaningful and timely feedback to process owners from the supervisor’s chain of  command,  Wing  IGs,  functional  oversight  agencies  (MAJCOM,  FOA,  ANG,  HAF FAMs,  Centers),  and  MAJCOM  IGs  during  the  Unit  Effectiveness  Inspection  (UEI) window, consistent with an effective battle rhythm for each area. Any deficiency or non-compliance found during the continual evaluation period will be provided directly to the process owner, the chain of command, and ultimately to the MAJCOM IG for inclusion in  the  wing’s  “photo  album”  of  performance.  (T-1)  Although  continual  evaluation activities  are  not  inspections  by  definition,  they  provide  accurate  and  functionally-assessed  data  upon  which  IGs  at  all  levels  base  inspection  sampling  strategies  and grading conclusions. 1.2.2.2.  Inspections  approved  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  Inspector  General (SAF/IG)/The  Inspector  General  (TIG)  are  conducted  by  functional  staff  (Functional) entities  to  provide  or  obtain  technical  information  or  assistance,  excluding  audits conducted  under  the  authority  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  Auditor  General (SAF/AG; TAG) and those audit activities conducted under the authority of the Secretary of the Air Force Comptroller (SAF/FM) specifically for the purposes of achieving audit readiness in accordance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan. 1.2.3.  When  differences  arise  concerning  inspections  governed  by  this  instruction  or  other inspection  guidance requirements, duplicative  inspections,  frequency,  scope,  etc.),  this  publication  will  take  precedence  over other Air Force inspection policy and guidance, unless otherwise specified in this instruction. requirements,  prioritized (functional inspection 1.3.  Purpose of the AFIS.  The purpose of the AFIS is threefold: 1.3.1.  To enable and strengthen commanders’ mission effectiveness and efficiency. 1.3.2.  To  motivate  and  promote  military  discipline,  improved  unit  performance,  and management excellence up and down the chain of command, in units and staffs. 1.3.3.  To  identify  issues  interfering  with  readiness,  economy,  efficiency,  discipline, effectiveness, compliance, performance, surety and management excellence.  1.4.  Objectives of the AFIS. 1.4.1.  The  AFIS  is  focused  on  assessing  and  reporting  on  a  unit’s  readiness,  economy, efficiency,  state  of  discipline  and  effectiveness  to  execute  assigned  missions.    The  AFIS gives SECAF, CSAF and commanders at all levels an independent assessment of: 1.4.1.1.  A  unit’s  compliance  with  established  directives  and  ability  to  execute  its assigned mission, leadership effectiveness, management performance, and aspects of unit culture and command climate. 10 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 1.4.1.2.  A unit's ability to find, report, analyze and fix deficiencies. 1.4.1.3.  A unit’s ability to prevent fraud and abuse, and to minimize waste. 1.4.2.  The  AFIS  gives  major  commands  (MAJCOM),  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  and Headquarters  Air  Force  (HAF)  Functionals  an  independent  assessment  of  functional effectiveness  and  compliance  in  the  field,  and  of  the  adequacy  of  organization,  policy, guidance, training and resources.   1.4.3.  The AFIS provides a mechanism for senior Air Force leaders to direct a targeted, more detailed and thorough inspection of specific programs, organizations, or issues. 1.4.4.  The  AFIS  gives  confidence  to  commanders  and  Airmen  at  every  level  that  mission readiness equals inspection readiness.    1.5.

Provide  or  help  identify  and  coordinate  for  inspector  augmentees  with functional expertise as requested by MAJCOM IG. 1.5.11.11.  In  conjunction  with  the  appropriate  MAJCOM  IG,  determine  units  to  be inspected based on the official Air Force list of NWRM NSNs.  See  Attachment 3 (A4 inspection requirements) for specific NWRM inspection guidance. 1.5.11.12.  SAVs  are  conducted  by  MAJCOM,  HAF  Functional  Staffs,  designated centralized  activities,  or  functional  manager  approved  experts  only  at  the  request  of  the Wing  Commander.  Wing  Commanders  may  also  request  assistance  visits  from  other wings/experts,  as  the  Commander  desires.  SAVs  may  help  a  unit  better  understand  the intent of higher headquarters policy and allow Functional staffs an opportunity to provide training to the unit. SAVs help MAJCOMs and HAF Functional staffs identify potential resource  constraints  and  develop  accurate  guidance/policy.  MFMs  will  coordinate  all SAVs  with  the  MAJCOM  Gatekeeper.  For  ANG  units,  ANG/IG  is  the  Gatekeeper.  All SAV  requests  will  be  sent  to  ANG/IG  for  processing.  (T-2)  SAVs  will  not  be  given  a rating  and  are  not  intended  to  be  used  as  a  tool  to  prepare  a  unit  for  a  formal  IG inspection.  (T-1)  All  SAVs  will  be  documented;  reports,  results  and  data  will  be  made available to the MAJCOM IG for inclusion in the UEI “photo album.”  (T-1) MAJCOM IGs will not treat SAVs as official inspection results, but will use SAV findings to inform their  RBSS.      Wing  IGs  should  validate  potential  deficiencies  identified  by  SAV  teams 20 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 and  enter  them  into  IGEMS  or  MICT,  as  appropriate,  tracking  corrective  actions  to closure and reengaging the unit when required.   1.5.12.  Non-IG  Air  Force  Inspection,  and  Accreditation  and  Certification  Teams  (see Attachment  2).  Commanders  will  ensure  non-IG  Air  Force  inspection,  accreditation  or certification team  designates a scheduling point  of contact  (POC) via  email  to  AFIA at  Air Force Gatekeeper Workflow (afia.tio.1@us.af.mil). (T-2)  The representative must have the authority to approve inspection schedule changes on behalf of the inspecting entity.  Each of these  inspections,  accreditations  or  certifications  will  be  synchronized  through  the appropriate Gatekeeper (see paragraph  2.9.1). 1.5.12.1.  HAF and MAJCOM Functionals will eliminate all non-IG inspections of Wings (as defined in paragraph  2.2), unless specifically approved by this AFI.  1.5.13.  Statutory Teams (see Attachment 2). TJAG, TAG and TIG have statutory authority and  responsibility  to  conduct  inspections  and  audits  which  must  guarantee  independence, instill  confidence  in  the  system,  and  be  free  of  any  appearance  of  undue  influence.    Each statutory  inspection  team  will  designate  a  scheduling  point  of  contact  (POC)  in  writing  to AFIA.    (T-2)  TJAG,  TAG,  TIG  and  their  authorized  representatives  must  coordinate  their inspections and audits with the appropriate MAJCOM Gatekeeper. (T-2)  Gatekeepers do not have the authority to approve/disapprove Article 6 inspections (TJAG, AF/JAI on behalf of TJAG),  Air  Force  Audit  Agency  audits  (TAG)  nor  AFIA  and  SAF/IGI  inspections  (TIG-directed); however, Gatekeepers have the most comprehensive view of unit activities and can facilitate optimum scheduling.  1.5.14.  Article 6 Inspectors. All judge advocates and paralegals selected to conduct Article 6 inspections are appointed by TJAG and must attend training as determined by TJAG.  (T-2) Training may include IGTC. Once properly trained, JA inspectors serve at the discretion of TJAG. TJAG will determine inspection requirements, policies, and procedures for Article 6 Inspections. 1.5.15.  AFIS training – Commanders will ensure Airmen complete the one-time Air Force Inspection  System  (AFIS)  computer  based  training  (CBT)  on  the  Advanced  Distributed Learning  Service  (ADLS).  (T-1)  The  Air  Force  Inspection  System  (AFIS)  course  serves  as an  introduction  to  the  Inspector  General  function  and  the  Air  Force  Inspection  System  to include  a  brief  look  from  various  role-specific  perspectives.  The  role-specific  training provides modules for Shop-Level Airmen, Commander, Wing IG, MAJCOM Staff & IG, and HQ  AF  Functional  Staff.  Completion  of  the  Overview,  AFIS  Basics,  and  at  least  one  role-specific  module  is  required.  (T-1)  Completion  of  this  course  is  required  for  all  Airmen (military and civilian); contractors are not required to take this training unless specified in the Statement of Work. (T-1) 1.6.  Safety.  Safety  considerations  must  be  of  paramount  importance  when  conducting  an inspection.    The  IG  and  Safety  staffs  must  closely  coordinate  their  efforts  to  be  mutually supportive in meeting their commander’s intent. (T-1)  Safety will coordinate their requirements with  the  Gatekeeper;  however,  should  high  priority  scheduling  conflicts  occur  that  the  IG  and Safety staffs are unable  to  mutually  agree upon, their commander will determine prioritization. (T-1) AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 21 1.6.1.  Safety Assessments, Evaluations and Inspections.  The IG fully recognizes Safety’s independent role on behalf of commanders and must allow their assessments, evaluations and workplace/facility  inspections  to  take  place  without  undue  influence  or  hardship  at  all organizational levels.     1.6.1.1.  At  the  Wing  level,  the  Safety  office  will  provide  the  commander  of  the  unit assessed/inspected  with  a  copy  of  their  reports  upon  completion.    The  report  will  be available  to  the  IG  through  the  unit  assessed/inspected.      If  conflict  exists  between  the AFIS process and the Air Force safety inspection, assessment and evaluation process, the commander will determine the appropriate course of action. 1.6.1.2.  Safety  evaluations  above  the  Wing  level  (such  as  the  HQ  Air  Force  Safety Center safety evaluation of MAJCOM Safety Office programs) will be coordinated with the  appropriate  Gatekeeper.    If  unable  to  establish  contact  with  the  Gatekeeper,  Safety will contact AFIA prior to coordinating requirements directly with the command chain of the affected organization. 1.6.2.  Safety  augmentation  to  the  MAJCOM  IG.  Safety  will provide  qualified SMEs to assist  with  IG  inspections.    The  IG  will  ensure  Safety  SMEs  are  qualified  to  inspect  the disciplines  that  will  require  a  “boots  on  the  ground”  inspection.  Inspectors  who  discover potential  Safety  deficiencies  will  validate  the  potential  deficiencies  with  a  qualified  Safety professional  at  the  appropriate  level  before  including  them  in  the  report  and  entering  them into IGEMS.  IAW established safety processes, Safety will prepare a comprehensive report on the status of the Commander’s safety program, inclusive of all safety disciplines evaluated and  will  attach  this  report  as  an  addendum  to  the  IG  report;  the  IG  will  enter  all  validated deficiencies  into  IGEMS.    Safety  will  manage  their  report  and  identified  safety  non-compliance issues through safety processes.  In accordance with Safety protocol, consultation with the Safety Office that validated the deficiency is required prior to closing out a Safety deficiency. 1.6.3.  Safety  augmentation  to  the  Wing  Inspection  Team  (WIT).  The  Wing  Safety Office will provide qualified SMEs to assist with Wing IG inspections, when possible. (T-1)    Inspectors who discover potential Safety deficiencies will validate the potential deficiencies with  a  qualified  Safety  professional  at  the  appropriate  level  before  including  them  in  the report  and  entering  them  into  IGEMS.  (T-1)    In  accordance  with  Safety  protocol, coordination with the Safety Office that validated the deficiency is required prior to closing out a Safety deficiency. (T-1) 1.6.3.1.  Wing  Safety  will  participate  with  the  WIT  whenever  possible;  however,  the Safety  staff,  IAW  established  safety  processes,  is  permitted  to  conduct  their  annual workplace/facility  inspections  and  unit  safety  assessments  independent  of  the  WIT.  Safety  will  provide  a  copy  of  their  inspection  and  assessment  reports  to  the  unit commander inspected/assessed.  This report is available to the IG office through the unit inspected.    The  Wing  Safety  office  will  coordinate  their  annual  inspection/assessment schedule with the Gatekeeper for deconfliction with Wing calendar events.   22 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 1.6.3.2.  The  Wing  IG  will  ensure  Safety  SMEs  are  available  to  assist  with  exercise scenario  development  and  throughout  the  execution  and  debrief  phases  of  the  exercise. (T-1)  Safety will provide the IG in writing any noted safety discrepancies for inclusion in  the  IG  report;  the  IG  will  enter  all  validated  deficiencies  into  IGEMS.  (T-1)    In accordance  with  Safety  protocol,  coordination  with  the  Safety  Office  that  validated  the deficiency is required prior to closing out a Safety deficiency. AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 23 Chapter 2 INSPECTION GUIDELINES 2.1.  Introduction.  The  AFIS  consists  of  three  synergistic  inspections  and  a  commander-led self-assessment program designed to evaluate different levels of command in the Air Force. Each inspection is designed to complement the other two, relying on the input and output of the other inspections  for  maximum  effectiveness  (see  Figure  2.1).  The  Self-Assessment  Program communicates essential information needed by HAF and MFMs to focus the risk based sampling strategy  utilized  during  the  three  main  Air  Force  inspections.  Subsequent  chapters  in  this instruction describe each inspection in further detail.  Figure 2.1.  The Air Force Inspection System (AFIS).  2.2.  Applicability  of  Inspections.  The  Management  Inspection  (MI)  is  conducted  above  the Wing level (HAF/MAJCOM/NAF and select FOAs/DRUs) and inspected IAW Chapter 3 of this instruction.  Unit Effectiveness Inspection (UEI) is conducted at the Wing-level and is inspected by MAJCOM IGs and AFIA IAW Chapter 4 of this instruction.  Throughout this instruction, the term  “Wing”  is  a  substitute  for  the  following  terms:  Wing,  DRU,  FOA,  Wing-equivalent  and unit.    MAJCOM  Commanders  determine  which  organizations  should  be  considered  “Wing-equivalents” for the purpose of AFIS.  All Air Force Wings will have a Commander’s Inspection Program (CCIP). (T-2)  Below the wing and as a critical part of an effective unit self assessment program, AFIS depends on all Airmen reporting honestly on whether or not they comply with all directives and reporting to their supervisors when they cannot comply. 2.3.  Major  Graded  Areas  (MGAs).  MGAs  represent  key  processes,  procedures  and requirements based on either public law, executive orders, directives and instructions.  The UEI and CCIP will assess  four MGAs:   Managing Resources,  Leading People,  Improving The Unit and  Executing  The  Mission  (see  Figure  2.2  and  Attachment  4).  (T-1)  These  MGAs  and  sub-areas come directly from AFI 1-2. See Chapter 3 for Management Inspection MGAs.   24 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 Figure 2.2.  UEI and CCIP Major Graded Areas. 2.4.  Inspection Types. 2.4.1.  Internal Inspections.  Internal Inspections are the foundation of the AFIS, promoting responsibility  and  accountability  within  the  unit  and  allowing  commanders  to  control  the depth, scope and frequency of inspections.    2.4.1.1.  IAW 10 USC § 8583 and AFI 1-2, Commander’s Responsibilities, commanders will  conduct  Internal  Inspections  and  actively  support  and  participate  in  External Inspections affecting their unit(s).  (T-0) 2.4.1.2.  Commanders  are  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance  within  their  units.  Commanders  will  ensure  their  CCIP  focuses  on  detecting  non-compliance  with  all applicable  governing  directives  and  on  unit  effectiveness  in  the  four  MGAs  in  Figure 2.2. (T-1) Inspections should be prioritized based on Commander’s priorities.  2.4.1.3.  For the purposes of this instruction, any inspection conducted by a wing member on  a  subordinate  agency  is  considered  an  internal  inspection.    Inspections  conducted  as part of the CCIP are considered internal inspections.  2.4.1.3.1.  There  may  be  non-IG  organizations  within  the  wing  that  are  explicitly authorized  to  inspect  on  behalf  of  the  commander  outside  of  an  IG  activity  and  not inspected  by  the  WIT  due  to  specific  inspector  requirements  and/or  commander’s intent  (i.e.,  Safety).    In  these  cases,  the  non-IG  inspectors  will  coordinate  their requirements  with  the  Gatekeeper.    The  report  will  be  provided  to  the  appropriate commander and will be available to the IG through the unit inspected/assessed. (T-1)  The  IG  and  the  non-IG  inspection  team  chief  will  collaborate  and  determine  the appropriate deficiencies to enter into IGEMS. (T-1) 2.4.2.  External  Inspections.  External  inspections  serve  two  purposes.    First,  they  provide an  independent,  transparent  and  accountable  assessment  of  readiness,  economy,  efficiency and state of discipline.  Additionally, external inspections are used to validate and verify the AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 25 internal inspections process. Any external agency planning to inspect, assess, evaluate, audit, assist, visit, or observe an Air Force unit/organization must follow the Gatekeeper procedures outlined  in  this  instruction.    External  inspections  requested  by  the  unit  commanders  are exempted from this requirement.   (T-3)  However, commander requested inspections should be tracked in the wing Gatekeeper calendar for overall awareness.   2.4.2.1.  External inspections include:  2.4.2.1.1.  IG Inspections. 2.4.2.1.1.1.  Unit  Effectiveness  Inspection  (UEI).    The  UEI  is  an  external, continual evaluation of Wing performance based on the four MGAs in Figure 2.2.  The UEI serves both purposes of an external inspection: providing an independent assessment of Wing effectiveness and validating/verifying the CCIP.  The UEI is not focused on detecting shop-level non-compliance.  Instead, the UEI is focused on  identifying  areas  where  the  risks  from  undetected  non-compliance  are greatest—helping  the  Wing  Commander  identify  blind  spots,  poorly  focused  or misaimed sensors in his/her CCIP. Though not focused on unit level compliance, compliance  sampling  or  more  comprehensive  director/commander  directed inspections  may  be  used  to  verify  CCIPs,  especially  in  areas  deemed  high-risk. Some  of  these  high-risk  areas  are  identified  in  Attachment  3,  the  authoritative source of HAF-level inspection requirements.  MAJCOM IG teams will build an inspection risk-based sampling strategy on, as a minimum, the areas identified in Attachment 3 for each unit.  2.4.2.1.1.2.  Management Inspection (MI).  See Chapter 3 for more specifics. 2.4.2.1.1.3.  Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI).  See Chapter 6 for more specifics. 2.4.2.1.2.  Non-Air  Force  Inspections.    Inspections  conducted  on  behalf  of  an organization outside the Air Force.  Personnel conducting the inspection may or may not  be Air Force personnel.  These typically include inspections conducted by other governmental agencies, combatant commands, or special committees.    2.4.2.1.3.  Statutory Inspections.  Inspections conducted on behalf of an organization within  the  Air  Force  who  has  specific  legal  or  statutory  authorization  to  conduct inspection-type activities.  These include, but are not limited to: audits conducted by the  Auditor  General,  inspections  conducted  by  TIG,  and  inspections  conducted  by TJAG. 2.4.2.1.4.  Certification/Accreditation/Technical  Survey. inspection-type activities  conducted  as  part  of  an  accreditation  or  certification  program.    Also includes  technical  surveys  where  facilities  and  equipment  are  measured  or  checked (e.g. boilers, pavement evaluations, etc.) and where job performance is not evaluated.   Those 2.4.2.1.5.  Installation-level  program  reviews/inspections  (e.g.  anti-terrorism,  safety, by-law programs, etc).  In instances where a Host or Tenant inspector is required for a program  and  that  inspector  must  perform  inspection-type  activities  on  units  outside his/her  Wing,  that  activity  is  considered  an  external  inspection  and  gatekeeper restrictions apply to protect the affected Host or Tenant Commander’s calendar.  The 26 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 Host  wing  POC  must  coordinate  with  the  tenant.    A  MOA  signed  by  both  host  and tenant commanders is sufficient. (T-1) 2.4.3.  By-Law Inspections.   2.4.3.1.  Specific program inspections that meet both of the following criteria: 2.4.3.1.1.  An inspection is required by higher-than Air Force policy. 2.4.3.1.2.  The  required  inspection  must  be  conducted  on  some  scheduled  frequency (e.g.  annually,  every  two  years,  etc.),  or  when  a  recurring  report  is  required  to  an organization outside the Air Force (e.g. OSD, Congress). 2.4.3.1.3.  By-Law  inspections,  as  listed  in  Table  5.1  of  this  instruction,  will  be conducted  on  a  fiscal  year  basis.  Wing  IGs  will  use  appropriate  Subject  Matter Experts (SME) when necessary to accomplish these inspections.  (T-0)  Commanders of  tenant,  active-duty  wing  and  non-wing  units  will  coordinate  By-Law  inspection requirements  with  the  host-wing  IG.  (T-2)  An  MOU/MOA  or  other  documentation  (e.g.  email  between  two  commanders)  must  be  established  (and  signed  between respective  parties)  to  identify  specific  inspection  responsibilities  by  wing/wing equivalents.  (T-0)    Complete  all  inspections  by  30  Sep  and  finalize  reports  on  or before the end of October. (T-0)  Identify any issues with meeting these timelines to AFIA by 15 September to determine if an extension is possible.  2.4.3.1.3.1.  MAJCOM/IGs will provide and validated all By-Law data contained within  the  Quarterly  Consolidated  By-Law  report  to  each  respective  wing  CCs and IGs. 2.4.3.1.4.  By-Law data will be extracted from IGEMS on a quarterly basis by AFIA for the Quarterly Consolidated By-Law report, see paragraph 8.14.6. 2.4.3.1.5.  AFIA will extract By-Law data from IGEMS on a FY basis for the Annual Consolidated By-Law report. 2.5.  Inspector  General  Authority.  SAF/IG  and  other  Air  Force  inspectors  (to  include  AFIA, MAJCOM  and  Wing  IG)  derive  their  authority  from  The  Inspector  General's  statutory  and regulatory authority and respective commander’s authorities. 2.5.1.  Inspector  Certification.  Commanders  will  certify  all  inspectors.  (T-1)  All  inspectors will  be  properly  trained  IAW  Chapter  9,  certified  in  writing  and  sworn-in  by  oath  (See Figure 9.4). (T-1) IG inspectors must be certified within 6 months of being assigned to the IG (See  Figure  9.1  and  Figure  9.2.).  (T-1)  Inspectors  are  considered  uncertified  until  all certification  requirements  above  are  met.  Inspection  augmentees  are  considered  uncertified inspectors.  Uncertified inspectors may participate in inspections; however, all findings must be validated by a certified inspector. (T-1)  2.5.1.1.  IGs  will  ensure  all  certifications  are  documented  and  filed  IAW  the  Air  Force Records  Disposition  Schedule  in  AFRIMS  and  documented  in  IGEMS.  (T-1)  IG  Team Chiefs will document completion of training requirements for inspection augmentees. (T-1) 2.5.1.2.  Certified IG inspectors will wear the IG duty badge IAW Chapter 9. (T-1)  2.5.1.3.  DELETED AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 27 2.5.1.4.  DELETED 2.5.2.  IG Oath. The oath reminds all IGs and inspection augmentees of the special trust and confidence inherent in their positions, and of the need for impartial, independent evaluation on  behalf  of  the  commander.  (See  Figure  9.4)    Officers,  NCOs,  and  DAF  civilians performing  duties  on  behalf  of  the  IG  will  take  the  IG  oath.  (T-1)  Contractor  personnel working in an IG staff section will not take the IG oath nor be inspectors. (T-0)  2.5.2.1.  Administering  the  Oath.  The  commander,  as  the  directing  authority,  should administer the oath to the IG (at a minimum) and all IGs serving in the IG staff section, preferably in a public forum where a significant portion of the command may witness it. If the commander is unable to administer the oath to all IGs in the staff section, this may be delegated to the MAJCOM IG or Wing IG. IGs will administer the oath to inspection augmentees. (T-2) 2.5.2.2.  Re-administering the Oath. Upon change of command, the incoming commander may  re-administer  the  oath  to  the  IG.  However,  a  new  oath  is  not  required.  If  an  IG moves to an IG staff section in another command, the IG will execute a new oath with the new commander. (T-2) All individuals with prior IG experience who are nominated for a second,  nonconsecutive  IG  assignment  must  execute  the  IG  oath  upon  arriving  at  the command. (T-0) 2.5.3.  Valid  Period  of  Inspector  Authority.  An  inspector’s  authority  is  only  valid  while assigned to an IG billet.  2.5.4.  Bargaining  unit  employees  may  be  assigned  to  an  IG  office  (wing,  MAJCOM  or HAF) as full-time certified inspectors or in a clerical/administrative support role. Bargaining unit  employees  may  also,  on  a  part-time  basis,  act  as  uncertified  inspectors/inspection augmentees.  IGs  will  ensure  bargaining  unit  members  do  not  act  as  investigators  in  any capacity to prevent conflicts. (T-0) 2.5.5.  Inspection  augmentees  are  MAJCOM  or  Wing  SMEs  and  WIT  members  that  are trained  IAW  Chapter  9,  but  not  certified  as  inspectors  (See  Figure  9.3).  Inspection augmentees  may  participate  in  inspections;  however,  all  findings  must  be  validated  by  a certified  inspector.  (T-1)  Rank  and  experience  requirements  are  determined  by  the WG/MAJCOM IG with the exception of requirements noted in Attachment 3.  2.5.6.  Use  of  Contractors  as  IG  inspectors.  Contractors  are  prohibited  from  acting  in  the capacity of an IG inspector since IG duties are an inherently governmental function per the Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  Circular  A-76  and  IAW  the  Federal  Activities Inventory  Reform  (FAIR)  Act  of  1998,  Public  Law  105-270.  However,  contractors  may participate  in  an  inspection  as  SMEs  gathering  information  for,  or  providing  advice, opinions,  recommendations  or  ideas  to  a  government  member  of  the  IG  unless  there  is  an Organizational Conflict of Interest resulting from other contracts held by the contractor. This may  be  determined  by  the  contracting  office  supporting  the  unit  being  inspected.  While contractors  can  act  as  “sensors”  providing  information  to  the  IG,  the  IG  must  make  all decisions  related  to  the  inspection,  including  schedule,  sample  selection,  deficiency assignment,  deficiency  severity,  MGA  grades  and  overall  ratings.  (T-0)  Commanders  will ensure  that  the  use  of  contractors  is  in  compliance  with  DODI  1100.22,  Guidance  for 28 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 Determining  Workforce  Mix.  (T-0)  Refer  to  paragraph  2.18  for  restrictions  on  contractor access to IG Technical Tools. 2.5.7.  Access to medical records. When an IG's access to medical records is required by this AFI, AFI 90-301, or other law or service-level regulation, such access is considered required by  law  and  disclosure  by  Air  Force  Medical  Service  (AFMS)  organizations  is  authorized under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as implemented by DoD  6025.18-R,  DoD  Health  Information  Privacy  Regulation.    All  medical  records maintained by the AFMS must be protected in accordance with DoD 6025.18-R, the Privacy Act and other applicable laws.  While medical records disclosed to and maintained by the IG are no longer HIPAA protected, they remain protected by the Privacy Act and may contain sensitive information protected by other applicable laws.  IGs must comply with the Privacy Act and any other applicable laws or information protection requirements in the further use and disclosure of such records. (T-0) 2.5.8.  IGs  are  not  authorized  access  to  material  subject  to  the  attorney  client  privilege,  or other legal privileged information involving DoD personnel individually represented by legal counsel, such as by an Area Defense Counsel or legal assistance attorney. However, any such privilege can be waived by the represented individual. Privileged safety information may be requested by IG from AFSEC/JA.  2.5.9.  Access to classified or sensitive information.  As part of any inspection, investigation or  other  directed  inquiry,  IGs  have  a  "need  to  know"  IAW  the  IG  Act  of  1978  and  DoDI 5205.11, Management, Administration, and Oversight of DoD Special Access Programs.   2.5.9.1.  Classified  access.    IGs  will  forward  a  visit  request  through  the  Joint  Personnel Adjudication  System  (JPAS)  to  the  security  management  office  determined  by  the  unit, for further distribution throughout the unit. (T-0) 2.5.9.2.  SAP Access.  SAP-level visit certifications and individual SAP accesses will not be transmitted using JPAS and will be vetted IAW AF SAPCO guidance.  AFOSI PJ with support from authorized IG representatives (i.e., AFOSI PJ Command Program Security Officers [PSOs]) will ensure appropriate SAP accesses, visitor badges, facility access is coordinated and approved in advance of the IG Team’s arrival. (T-0) 2.5.9.3.  Commanders  will  ensure  that  access  to  classified  information  is  IAW  DoDI 5205.11  and  AFI  31-401,  Information  Security  Program  Management.    (T-0)    If classification  or  compartmentalization  restrictions  preclude to information  required  by  an  IG,  the  denying  commander  will  immediately  report  the situation  to  the  appropriate  access-control  authority  and  obtain  an  access-eligibility determination.    If  this  authority  does  not  grant  access  to  the  information,  the  IG  will notify the commander and SAF/IGI of the situation.  (T-2) Commanders will ensure that the notice to SAF/IGI includes the location, date, and command; scope of the assistance inquiry,  inspection,  or  investigation;  who  denied  access;  who  verified  denial  and/or approved denial; the reason access was denied; and the immediate contact details of the supervisor and commander of the organization. (T-1) immediate  access 2.5.10.  Special Access Programs.  The SAF/IG is responsible for inspection functions for all Air  Force  SAPs  and  for  maintaining  a  sufficient  cadre  of  inspectors  to  do  so.    Under SAF/IG’s  administrative  oversight,  AFOSI  is  responsible  for  performing  program  security, AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 29 investigation and counterintelligence functions for all Air Force SAPs and for maintaining a sufficient cadre of investigators, special agents, analysts and program security officers to do so. 2.5.10.1.  All  IG  Inspection  Reports  and  related  materials  which  contain  or  reference Special Access Program data (to include appendices, attachments, sensitive relationships, etc)  will  be  handled  within  approved  Air  Force  SAP  communications  channels  and facilities. (T-0) All SAP-related inspections will be housed within the Configuration and Security Tracking System (CASTS) for Special Access Program Facilities (SAPFs) or a successor  system  identified  by  AFOSI  PJ.  (T-1)    System  administrators  will  ensure access  is  controlled  to  only  those  IG  representatives  designated  by  SAF/IGI,  AFIA  and MAJCOM IGs. (T-1) 2.5.10.2.  Wing  IGs  will  validate  that  Commanders  meet  compliance  requirements  for SAP activities within their wings. (T-0)   2.5.10.3.  MAJCOM IGs will coordinate and work with respective SMEs on the staff to conduct SAP inspection activities as part of their UEI continual evaluation battle rhythm.  Additionally, MAJCOM IGs may coordinate with AFOSI PJ for functional expertise for inspecting SAP activities, as desired.   2.5.10.4.  AFIA/ET  will  coordinate  and  work  with  SAF/IGI  and  AFOSI  PJ  to  conduct SAP inspection activities as part of their MI battle rhythm.  Incorporate all SAF/IG SAP continual evaluation activities into the respective major graded areas and overall grade of the MI.  2.5.10.5.  SAF/IGI will coordinate with respective SMEs on the Air Staff, AFIA/ET and AFOSI  PJ  to  conduct  SAP  inspection  activities  as  part  of  the  Air  Staff  continual evaluation battle rhythm.   2.5.10.6.  The  SAF/IG  or  a  designated  representative  may  attend  any  Special  Access Required  Programs  Oversight  Committee,  Special  Programs  Review  Group  and  SAP Oversight Review Board meeting, and other meetings as directed by SECAF and defined by AFI 16-701, Special Access Programs. 2.5.10.7.  SAF/IG  may  propose  an  inspection,  assessment  or  management  review  of  a SAP  or  SAP  function  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force.    In  addition  to  DoDI  5205.11, SECAF  approval  of  a  proposed  SAF/IG  inspection,  assessment  or  management  review establishes  SAP  access  “need  to  know”  for  the  SAF/IG  assigned  and  credentialed personnel  required  to  accomplish  such  inspection,  assessment  or  management  review activities.  In addition to the “need to know”, these credentialed personnel must meet the SAP  access  eligibility  requirements  outlined  in  AFI  16-701  as  do  individuals  who conduct  SAF/IG  investigations    (SAF/IG  investigations  establish  their  own  “need  to know”).   2.5.11.  Access  Control  and  Routine  Searches.  Inspector  General  personnel  properly identifying  themselves  as  representatives  of  the  IG  and  properly  identified  on  a  signed, authenticated  IG  Entry  Authority  List  (EAL)  shall  be  authorized  entry  to  Protection  Level resources  via  established  entry  procedures  identified  in  AFI  31-101,  Integrated  Defense (FOUO)  and  DOD  S-5210.41-M,  Volumes  1-3_AFMAN  31-108,  The  Air  Force  Nuclear Weapon Security Manual. (T-0) 30 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 2.5.12.  Access to Information and Spaces. To carry out their responsibilities, Air Force IGs shall have expeditious and unrestricted access to and, when required, be given copies of all records,  reports,  investigations,  audits,  reviews,  documents,  papers,  recommendations,  or other  material  available  to  or  within  any  USAF  activity.  (T-0)  While  performing  official duties  as  an  inspector,  IGs  will  be  granted  access  to  any  and  all  documents,  records,  and evidentiary  materials  needed  to  discharge  their  duties,  to  include  data  stored  in  electronic repositories.  (T-0)  Some  examples  are  classified  documents,  records  of  board  proceedings, acquisition information, medical records, medical quality assurance records, drug and alcohol records,  financial  records,  evaluation  reports,  back-channel  messages,  security  dossiers, criminal investigation reports (as permitted by law and applicable regulations), and financial disclosure  statements.  This  authority  includes  direct  access  to  pertinent  extracts  as  allowed by applicable regulations. (T-0) 2.6.  Inspection Frequency.  See Chapter 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this instruction for specific inspection frequency. 2.7.  Air  Force  Inspection  Scheduling  Process.  The  purpose  of  the  Air  Force  Inspection Scheduling  Process  is  to  synchronize  inspection  efforts  to  maximize  unit  training  days  and inspection  resource  utilization;  build  out-year  schedules;  and  align  non-Air  Force  inspection requirements listed in Attachment 2 with Air Force inspection schedules.   2.7.1.  Gatekeepers  will  establish  inspection  schedules  within  their  MAJCOM  via  the  Air Force  Gatekeeper  Program  website.    Gatekeepers  will  ensure  that  schedules  include  a projection of 60 months (or two full UEI cycles).  For example, by 1 Mar 2014, AFIA will publish the Air Force Inspection Schedule via an access-controlled website for FY15-16 and a tentative schedule for FY 17-18.  (T-1) 2.8.  Inspection  Notification.  In  addition  to  scheduled  capstone  events  and  in  line  with  the overall  intent  to  evaluate  daily  unit  effectiveness,  eliminate  effort  wasted  on  inspection preparation and validate that daily mission readiness is inspection readiness.  No- and min-notice inspections,  through  risk-based  sampling  strategy,  are  an  integral  aspect  of  the  AFIS.   No-  or min-notice  often  refers  to  the  time  between  initial  inspection  notification  and  the  arrival  of  the team  for  an  in-brief.   However,  no-  or  min-notice  inspections  are  also  effectively  produced through sampling--when the IG selects the program, team, or Airmen to be inspected.  No- and min-notice  inspection  sampling  occurs  throughout  the  UEI  continual  evaluation  phase,  and through the validation/verification component of the CCIP.  (For ANG:  If specific programs or events are to be inspected, MAJCOM IGs will consider available unit manpower and resources when coordinating notification timeframes.  MAJCOM IGs will coordinate with ANG/IG for all ANG  inspections  and  will  notify  ANG/IG  and  Wing  CC  a  minimum  of  48  hours  prior  to  any ANG no-notice inspection. The 48 hours minimum notice does not apply to the inspection of the ANG alert force missions.  Commanders will determine the amount of notice to give inspected units. (T-1) 2.8.1.  Trusted  Agents.    SAF/IGI,  AFIA,  AFSEC/SEW,  ANG/IG,  MAJCOM  and  OSI Gatekeepers,  and  Functional  inspection  team  scheduling  POCs  who  participate  in  the  Air Force  Inspection  Scheduling  Process  are  trusted  agents  for  the  Air  Force  Inspection Schedule. 2.8.2.  ARC units will participate in MAJCOM IG no-notice UEI events and min-notice NSIs IAW paragraph 2.8. (T-2) AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 31 2.8.3.  MAJCOM  IGs  must  recognize  there  may  be  limited  availability  of  ARC  unit personnel  in  some  functional  areas  when  initiating  no/min-notice  inspections  IAW paragraph  2.8. 2.9.  MAJCOM Inspection Programs—General Guidelines. 2.9.1.  Gatekeeper.    Gatekeepers  at  all  levels  must  ensure  the  inspection  system  is  able  to independently  and  efficiently  inspect  units  on  behalf  of  the  command  chain.  (T-2) Gatekeepers  ensure  a  commander’s  priorities  take  precedence  over  non-mission-essential activities of any unit/organization.  Gatekeepers have the authority to approve or disapprove, schedule,  de-conflict  and  eliminate  duplication  between  all  inspection-type  activities  on behalf of their commander.  POCs of inspections listed in Attachment 2 should contact the MAJCOM Gatekeeper for scheduling coordination.  Any outside agency seeking to conduct an  inspection  not  listed  in  Attachment  2  must  contact  AFIA  Gatekeeper  for  coordination.  Any outside agencies seeking to include an inspection in Attachment 2 must follow the AF Inspection System Governance Process in  paragraph 2.21.  Gatekeepers are responsible to deconflict, synchronize, and schedule Attachment 2 inspections however, gatekeepers cannot disapprove  Attachement  2  visits  by  offering  optimum  timeframes  for  the  appropriate  units.  (For  ANG  units,  ANG/IG  is  the  Gatekeeper  for  MAJCOM  coordination  and  for  non-UEI Gatekeeper events.) 2.9.1.1.  MAJCOM  Gatekeeper  functions  include  the  ability  to  establish/maintain situational  awareness  and  to  synchronize  and  de-conflict  unit  inspections,  assessments and evaluations within their MAJCOM.  MAJCOM Gatekeepers also review subordinate wing inspection schedules, via the Air Force Gatekeeper Program website for continuous evaluation of local exercise scenarios and inspections.  Gatekeeping unit inspections may include tracking organizations below the wing level, as needed.  2.9.1.2.  Gatekeepers will only approve access to their wings: (T-1) 2.9.1.2.1.  IAW their MAJCOM commander’s guidance. (T-2) 2.9.1.2.2.  For inspections listed in Attachment 2 located on the Gatekeeper website.  If  an  inspecting  authority  is  requesting  access  to  an  installation  and  their  inspection activity  is  not  listed  in  Attachment  2,  nor  approved/requested  by  the  Wing commander,  Gatekeepers  will  contact  their  MAJCOM  Gatekeeper  and/or  AFIA  for assistance to either validate the inspection activity or deny access to the installation. (T-1) 2.9.1.2.3.  For inspections listed in Attachment 2 verify timelines, approval methods and no-notice inspection authority IAW references provided in Attachment 2. (T-1)  2.9.1.3.  For requests that do not meet the above criteria, Gatekeepers should deny access to the installation and direct the requestor to follow the procedures in paragraph 2.21.2. to  request  the  activity  be  vetted  by  the  Inspection  System  Governance  Process  for consideration to be added to Attachment 2.  2.9.1.4.  Non-Air  Force  Agency  Access  to  Inspect.  Any  non-Air  Force  agency  (DoD, DTRA, DISA, GAO, etc.) requesting access to an installation to conduct inspection-type activity should contact AFIA and request liaison with appropriate MAJCOM Gatekeeper. (T-1)  32 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 2.9.1.4.1.  Gatekeepers  should  make  every  effort  to  accommodate  the  request  while balancing  the  need  to  guard  a  unit’s  calendar  whitespace  through  synchronization IAW  their  commanders’  priorities.    If  unable  to  resolve  the  non-Air  Force  agency request, AFIA will notify SAF/IGI for assistance. (T-1)  2.9.1.4.2.  Civilian  medical  inspection  agencies  listed  in  Attachment  2  (AAAHC, TJC)  coordinate  inspection  schedules  with  trusted  agents  at  AFMOA/SGHQ.   AFMOA/SGHQ  coordinates  directly  with  AFIA  and  MAJCOM  Gatekeepers  for scheduling for both notice and no-notice inspections. 2.9.1.5.  Non-Air  Force  Agency  Request  for  Inspection  Observation  Access.    Agencies external  to  the  Air  Force  will  coordinate  requests  to  observe  IG  inspections  through AFIA  (primary)  or  SAF/IGI  (secondary)  for  SAF/IG  approval.   Upon  approval,  AFIA will also  serve as the liaison  to  coordinate with  all external  agencies requesting support and observer actions. 2.9.1.6.  Any  agency planning to  inspect,  assess,  evaluate, audit, assist,  visit,  or observe an  Air  Force  unit/organization  must  contact  the  MAJCOM  Gatekeeper  as  early  as possible, and no later than 30 days prior to the desired visit. (T-1) Visits requested by unit commanders are exempted from this requirement.  2.10.  MAJCOM HQ Role in the AFIS. 2.10.1.  MAJCOM  HQ will  establish  an  effective  and  efficient  battle  rhythm  to:  1)  execute the  UEI  continual  evaluation  IAW  Chapter  4;  2)  identify  and  track  action  items  for MAJCOM  HQ  and  Wing  action;  3)  identify  potential  action  items  for  HAF  consideration.  The following battle rhythm will be used: 2.10.1.1.  Monthly.  MFMs  will  analyze  any  portion  of  MICT  data  and  other  functional metrics  in  order  to  build  awareness  of  unit  performance  in  areas  of  responsibility  and share areas of concern with the appropriate level IG, when identified. 2.10.1.2.  Quarterly Inspection Working Group (QIWG).  The QIWG will be chaired by the MAJCOM IG (delegable no lower than the Deputy IG).  The members include Wing IGs  and  MAJCOM  HQ  deputy  directors  (ANG/IGD  for  ANG)  and  special  staff.  At  a minimum,  discuss negative trends identified  at  the command or unit levels  and develop recommendations for approval by the Inspection System Council. 2.10.1.3.  Semi-Annual  Inspection  Council  (SAIC).    The  SAIC  is  chaired  by  the MAJCOM/CC/CV  (delegable  no  lower  than  a  Director).    MAJCOM/CC/CV  directs  the members to include Wing CCs, ANGRC/CV, HQ Directors and Special Staff, and others. At  a  minimum,  the  council  agenda  will  include  inspection  results,  trends  and recommended actions. 2.10.2.  Inspection  alignment  with  the  AEF  battle  rhythm.    Commandersd  will  ensure  that inspections  are  deconflicted  with  unit  AEF  vulnerability  period(s)  and/or  scheduled deployments,  ANG  operations  and  maintenance  deployments,  and  unit  force  structure changes. (T-2) Inspections will be tailored, as necessary, to allow requisite unit support to the combatant  command.    MAJCOM  IGs  will  make  final  determination  of  scheduling  and tailoring.    AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 33 2.11.  FOAs’ Role in Support of MAJCOMs. 2.11.1.  For  areas  in  which  a  MAJCOM  HQ  has  limited  expertise  due  to  consolidation  of subject-matter-experts  to  FOAs  or  Centralized  Activities,  MAJCOM  IGs  will  ensure FOA/DRU/Centralized Activity inclusion in the battle rhythm defined in paragraph 2.10.1.2 and  2.10.1.3.  FOAs  that  have  consolidated  SME  responsibilities  on  behalf  of  MAJCOM functional  directorates  will  conduct  a  monthly  analysis  of  any  portion  of  MICT  data  and other  functional  metrics  to  build  awareness  of  unit  performance.  (T-2)  Additionally,  these FOAs  will  provide  support  as  special  staff  in  the  Quarterly  Inspection  Working  Group described in paragraph 2.10.1.2. (T-2) 2.12.  On-Site Inspections. 2.12.1.  All  inspection  authorities  will  consolidate  inspections  to  avoid  redundancy.  (T-2) Eliminate  on-site  inspections  that  are  not  mission-relevant,  do  not  outweigh  their  costs,  or detract from mission performance or readiness. 2.12.2.  When  scheduling  inspections  for  installations  with  units  gained  by  multiple MAJCOMs,  MAJCOM  IGs  will  coordinate  the  inspection  schedules  to  conduct  concurrent MAJCOM inspections. 2.12.3.  IG Reciprocity.  MAJCOM and Wing IG reciprocity is an essential component of the AFIS.    When  it  comes  to  inspecting  geographically  separated  units  (GSUs),  risk,  cost,  and reciprocity all factor into the decision.  These educated decisions based on risk and resource management concerning inspecting GSUs are driven by commander’s intent.  If an IG needs to  inspect  a  GSU,  he  or  she  may  request  a  collocated  IG  conduct  the  inspection  on  their behalf.    IGs  should  accommodate  inspection  reciprocity  requests  to  the  maximum  extent possible.  Additionally, requesting IGs shall honor deficiencies reported by the inspecting IG as if they were their own.  Reciprocity requests should be documented in a memorandum of agreement  between  the  concerned  parties.    See  paragraph  4.4.2.1.3.  for  IG  reciprocity regarding multi-MAJCOM ANG wings. (T-2) 2.12.4.  Limiting factors, simulations and deviations.  The inspected unit will submit limiting factors (LIMFAC), simulations (SIM) and deviations (DEV) that could potentially affect the inspection's  outcome  to  the  inspection  team  chief.  (T-2)  Commanders  will  ensure  that approved LIMFAC, SIM, or DEV from authorized policy and guidance is coordinated with the  MAJCOM  IG.  (T-2)    Approved  LIMFACs,  SIMs  and  DEVs  which  may  impact inspection  processes  and  outcomes  will  be  announced  to  all  inspectors  prior  to  the commencement of any inspection activities. (T-2) 2.12.5.  Entry Authority List (EAL).  Commanders or Directors will ensure the EAL will be sent  to  the  unit’s  Security  office  at  the  location  of  the  inspection  for  dissemination  to inspected  units/organizations  IAW  DoD5210.41M_AFMAN  31-108  (for  nuclear  capable units) and AFI 31-101 requirements. Courtesy copy the host unit security for awareness. (T-1) 2.12.6.  Inspection Footprint. IG Team Chiefs will work with the inspected unit prior to the inspection  to  ensure  there  is  a  shared  understanding  of  inspection  constraints  due  to  space, security, escort ratio, etc.  The Team Chief will attempt to minimize the inspector footprint to the maximum extent practical; however, the Team Chief will make the final determination on inspector footprint to ensure adequate access for the inspectors.  34 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 2.12.6.1.  MAJCOM  IGs  will  conduct  periodic  site  visits  and/or  review  documents  and after action reports of unit activity in conjunction with exercises and contingencies, real-world  operations,  self-assessments,  other  inspection/evaluations,  risk-based  sampling strategy techniques, and other measures of sustained performance.  These measures will be used to adjust the breadth, duration, and incidence of on-site inspection activities. 2.12.6.2.  When  practical,  IG  teams  may  deploy  to  forward  locations  and  headquarters during  exercises  and  contingency  operations  to  evaluate  processes  and  performance.  Inspectors may observe, but will not interfere with, real world activities unless observed actions  are  in  direct  violation  of  mandated  guidance  or  if  injury  to  personnel  and/or damage to equipment could occur that may cause significant mission degradation. (T-1) 2.12.7.  IG Team Work Center Requirements. The MAJCOM IG Team Chief will coordinate specific  work  center  requirements  with  the  inspected  unit.  When  multiple  MAJCOM  IG teams  are  involved  in  an  event,  the  lead  IG  team  (with  the  preponderance  of  inspection responsibilities at the location or IAW with existing MOAs) will consolidate work center and logistics requirements of all teams in order to have a single deconflicted set of requirements for wings to support. 2.12.8.  Selection for Performance-Based Evaluations.  Inspection teams will randomly select individuals/teams  for  executing  performance-based  evaluations  in  lieu  of  the  inspected  unit self-identifying individuals/teams for evaluation (maintain team integrity as appropriate). (T-1)  For  ARC  units,  MAJCOM/IGs  should  consider  available  unit  manpower  and  resources when selecting individuals/teams for evaluation and consider the part-time force that may not be  available  on  non-UTA  days.  As  a  minimum  prior  to  each  evaluation,  discuss  the starting/stopping  points,  allowed  previously  complied  with  (PCW)  steps  and  approve  any required  SIMs/DEVs.  (T-1)  Inspectors  may  brief  applicable  items  from  paragraph 6.10.2.2.3. to the individual(s)/team(s) being evaluated prior to the start of the evaluation. 2.13.  Inspecting Contracted Functions. 2.13.1.  Performance  Work  Statement  (PWS).  The  Contracting  Officer  and/or  Contracting Officer  Representative  (COR)  will  accompany  the  IG  during  inspections  of  contracted functions.  (T-1)  Inspectors  will  assess  and  rate  contracted  functions  against  the  PWS  and assess  adequacy  of  the  PWS  to  meet  mission  requirements  while  developing  and implementing  safeguards  to  prevent  contractor  claims  resulting  from  inspection  activities. (T-2)  Inspectors  must  communicate  with  the  Contracting  Officer  and/or  the  COR  to  fully understand  the  scope  and  limitations  of  the  contracting  authorities  and  must  work  closely with them to prevent a possible misunderstanding or the creation of a condition that may be the basis of a later claim against the Government. (T-0) 2.13.2.  Rating  and  Report.  Commanders  will  ensure  that  contracted  functions  are  rated; however,  individual  contractors  will  not  be  rated.  (T-2)    Commanders  will  ensure  that emphasis is placed on the compliance of the function to be performed, not on the status of the personnel (military, civil service, or contractor) performing the function. (T-2)  Commanders will  ensure  that  sampling  of  contracted  activities  is  coordinated  through  the  Contracting Officer  and/or  COR.  (T-2)    Contractors  may  be  provided  with  applicable  portions  of  the report IAW DOD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, Freedom of Information Act Program.  (T-0) AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 35 2.13.3.  Validation.   Validate  observations  related  to  contractor  functions  with  the Contracting Officer.  Commanders will ensure that deficiencies are tracked IAW paragraph 2.19.  (T-2)    Only  the  Contracting  Officer  can  take  formal  action  against  the  contractor  for noncompliance or direct contractors to correct deficiencies identified during inspections.   2.14.  Additional Inspections. 2.14.1.  Federal  Recognition  Inspection  (FRI).  The  lead  MAJCOM  will  conduct  a  FRI  of  a state unit when the unit is being considered for federal recognition, or when asked to do so by the ANG/IG. Conduct the FRI according to AFI 90-201 ANGSUP, The Air Force Inspection System. 2.14.2.  Biological  Select  Agents  and  Toxins  (BSAT)  Inspections.    AFMC/IG  will  conduct BSAT  compliance  inspections  for  all  units  that  are  registered  by  the  Centers  for  Disease Control  and  Prevention  in  accordance  with  governing  directives  (DODI  5210.89_AFI  10-3901,  Minimum  Security  Standards  for  Safeguarding  Biological  Select  Agents  and  Toxin). The  inspection  is  designed  to  evaluate  a  unit's  compliance  with  applicable  policies  for laboratory operations within Biological Safety Level III facilities which store and use BSAT. 2.14.3.  Wounded,  Ill,  and  Injured  (WII)  Facility  Inspections.  IGs  conduct  WII  Facility Inspections, as required by National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) FY2008, House of Representatives  (H.R.)  4986,  Section  1662,  Access  of  Recovering  Service  Members  to Adequate  Outpatient  Residential  Facilities  IAW  Attachment  8.  (T-0)    Commanders  will ensure WII Facility Inspections are conducted in conjunction with other IG inspections, but are a separate, distinct inspection providing a separate inspection report. (T-1)   WII Facility Inspections will utilize a 3-tier rating scale:  IN COMPLIANCE,  IN COMPLIANCE WITH COMMENTS,  or  NOT  IN  COMPLIANCE.  (T-1)    Refer  to  Attachment  8  for  specific information pertaining to WII inspections.  2.14.4.  Cemetery  Inspections.    The  closest  assigned  Wing  IG  will  inspect  cemeteries identified on the DoD list as being under the care of the USAF IAW requirements mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act, Section 592.  Commanders will ensure that the inspection  of  military  cemeteries  shall  include  an  assessment  of  the  items  listed  in Attachment 9. (T-0) 2.15.  Self-Assessment  Communicator  Fragmentary  Order  (SAC  FRAGO).  AFIS  gives HAF Functionals a responsive capability to get validated/verified data directly from units using MICT.    The  mechanism  is  an  order—a  Self-Assessment  Communicator  Fragmentary  Order (SAC  FRAGO)—from  VCSAF  to  MAJCOM  and  other  commanders  to  complete  a  specified SAC  in  MICT  for  a  high-priority,  often  time-sensitive  requirement.    HAF  Functionals  should submit a SAC FRAGO request for VCSAF approval and transmission through normal HAF/ES coordination channels.  2.16.  The Air Force Special Interest Item (SII) Program.  SIIs provide a means to gather data to evaluate the status of specific programs and conditions in the field requiring Air Force senior leader attention.  There should be no more than five active SIIs at any given time.  2.16.1.  SAF/IGI  manages  the  Air  Force  SII  program  by  coordinating  Air  Force  SII  topic proposals and obtaining SAF/IG approval; distributing approved Air Force SIIs to MAJCOM IGs; compiling and forwarding SII data to the sponsoring agency. 36 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 2.16.2.  SAF/IGI will assess every potential SII for its impact on the nuclear enterprise and if necessary, coordinate with AF/A10 prior to publication. 2.16.3.  SII  Sponsors.    The  Offices  of  the  Secretary  and  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Air  Force, SAF/IG and HAF Functionals may sponsor SIIs.  HAF Functional-proposed SII topics may be  initiated  at  any  level  but  must  be  submitted  by  the  appropriate  HAF  Functional  to SAF/IGI  at  usaf.pentagon.saf-ig.mbx.saf-igi-workflow@mail.mil.   Submit  SII  topic proposals in the format provided on the SAF/IGI Air Force Portal website.  Coordinate with MAJCOM FAMs (to include ARC) prior to submitting a proposed Air Force SII. 2.16.4.  MAJCOM  IGs  will  receive  SII  notification  from  SAF/IGI.    MAJCOM  IGs  will notify  all  subordinate  units/organizations  (including  gained  ARC  units)  of  the  SII requirements as soon as possible following publication of the SII. 2.16.5.  MAJCOM IGs will evaluate all active SIIs during formal inspections.  Document the results of SII inspections as a separate section of the final inspection report.   2.16.6.  SII  Reports.    MAJCOM/IGs  will  document  SII  results  in  IGEMS.    Units  not receiving a MAJCOM/IG inspection or continual evaluation event during the active period of the SII will conduct a one-time inspection in IGEMS on the SII topic using the instructions accompanying the SII.  Results will be documented in IGEMS.  (T-1) 2.16.7.  Rating.    Normally,  SIIs  will  not  be  rated/graded;  the  SII  is  for  gathering  data  for analysis and action as necessary.  If a rating is required as part of the SII, the scale will be specified in the SII instructions. 2.16.8.  MAJCOM  Command  Interest  Items  (CII).    MAJCOM/  Commanders  may  wish  to establish MAJCOM-unique procedures to  gather data and/or place emphasis on a particular program via a Command Interest Item (CII).  Ensure that MAJCOM CIIs do not conflict with Air Force SIIs. 2.16.8.1.  In cases where a lead MAJCOM, including but not limited to core function lead integrators, needs to issue a CII to other MAJCOMs whom the CII also applies to, then the lead MAJCOM should  coordinate with  those applicable MAJCOMs to have the CII issued there as well.  If unsuccessful, then the lead MAJCOM IG may consult SAF/IG for consideration of issuing an SII to satisfy lead functional authority requirements. 2.17.  The  Inspector  General’s  Inspection  Reporting  System  (TIGIRS).  Includes  three  AF Program of Records, the IG Evaluation Management System (IGEMS), the Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT), and the Air Force Gatekeeper Site.   2.17.1.  IGEMS. 2.17.1.1.  IGs will ensure the following data, at a minimum, is entered into IGEMS. (T-1) 2.17.1.1.1.  MAJCOM  IGs  will  input  the  unit’s  overall  rating  within  5  duty  days  of the Capstone report submission (for ANG and Air Force Reserve units, within 1 UTA after final report submission).   2.17.1.1.2.  Post the final inspection report in IGEMS w/in 5 duty days of final report submission  (for  ANG  units  and  Air  Force  Reserve  units,  within  1  UTA  after  final report submission). AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 37 2.17.1.1.3.  In most cases, IG-identified deficiencies will be entered into IGEMS and assigned  to  the  appropriate  organizational  POC(s)  to  resolve.  (T-1)    This  allows  a formal  corrective  action  process  to  resolve  deficiencies,  enforces  accountability  for inaction,  and  provides  trending  across  all  levels  of  command.    There  may  be  some cases where an inspector can detect and solve small issues on the spot, including but not  limited  to  incorrect  uniform  wear  or  a  seatbelt  not  secured  properly.    In  these cases,  IGs  can  make  corrections  without  an  IGEMS  entry.    However,  if  there  is  a trend  of  these  small,  isolated  cases,  an  entry  into  IGEMS  is  warranted  to  ensure leadership  awareness,  corrective  action,  and  trending.    IGs  may  enter  deficiencies found  by  non-IG  inspectors  into  IGEMS  only  after  assessing  and  validating  the deficiencies IAW AFI 90-201.  IG Augmentees from Functional Areas may also enter data in functional data systems in addition to, not in lieu of, IGEMS.   2.17.1.1.3.1.  All  HAF-level  (Air  Staff  and  non-Air  Force)  deficiencies  will  be tracked to closure within IGEMS or IGEMS-C.   2.17.1.1.3.2.  Personal  Identifiable  Information  (PII),  HIPAA,  DoD  UCNI classified  information,  and  federal  law  Title  10  USC  1102,  Medical  Quality Assurance  data  will  not  be  entered  into  IGEMS  until  the  proper  protection mechanisms are in place.   This data is sensitive information and must be treated IAW Privacy Act of 1974.  FOUO data is approved in IGEMS. 2.17.1.1.3.3.  If  a  deficiency  contains  information  protected  IAW  Privacy  Act  of 1974 and Title 10 USC 1102, Medical Quality Assurance Records, an abbreviated description of the deficiency will be entered into IGEMS along with the following statement:  "Per  10  USC,  Section  1102,  details  of  this  deficiency  are  not documented  in  this  report."    Detailed  documentation  will  be  provided  in  a separate word document to the MAJCOM/IG, WG/CC, WG/IG, MDG/CC, and, if appropriate,  MAJCOM/SG  and  AFMOA/SGHQ,  for  awareness,  tracking  and/or resolution. 2.17.1.1.3.4.  All By-Law validated data will be input into the By-Law section of IGEMS  for  each  By-Law  separately.  (T-1)  The  comments  box  in  IGEMS  will annotate which MGA, and if appropriate which sub-MGA applies. (T-1) For Host units  the  comments  must  include  any  Tenant  units  that  are  covered  by MOU/MOA. (T-1) For Tenant units who have an established MOU/MOA with a host unit the comments section must at a minimum reference the MOA/MOU for each respective By-law. (T-1) Functional Areas must appropriately be assigned to By-Law validated data, and will not state “By-Law Program.” (T-1) 2.17.1.1.3.5.  All  deficiencies  will  be  tracked  to  closure  within  IGEMS  or IGEMS-C. (T-1) 2.17.1.1.4.  Enter  dates  when  deficiencies  are  opened,  assigned  and  closed.  In addition,  enter  CAPs    and  Deficiency  Cause  Code  (s)  (see  Attachment  7)  within  5 duty days of CAP   implementation (for ANG units, within 1 UTA after CAP).  See paragraph 2.19. for deficiency tracking guidance. 38 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 2.17.1.1.5.  MAJCOM  IG  will  enter  top  five  most  common  issues  identified  by Airmen during ATIS-Gs for SECAF consideration, categorized by UEI sub-MGA in IGEMS. 2.17.1.2.  For classified inspection reporting, use existing reporting methods on the Secret Internet  Protocol  Router  Network  (SIPRNet).  IG  teams  will  fully  utilize  IGEMS-C  for classified inspection reporting, including Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspection (NWTI) reports IAW CJCSI 3263.05B. 2.17.1.2.1.  IGs will ensure CAP data is included for all required deficiencies loaded into IGEMS and IGEMS-C. (T-1)  2.17.1.3.  Access  management.    AFIA,  SAF/IGI  and  IG  Administrators  will  administer access to IGEMS. (T-1) 2.17.1.3.1.  Contractor  access  to  IGEMS.  Contractor  access  to  IGEMS  is  limited  to the roles of basic user, scheduler, and planner and shall not register as inspectors or administrators. (T-1) Contractors are not allowed access to IGEMS-C. (T-1) 2.17.1.3.2.  Foreign National access to IGEMS. Foreign Nationals are only authorized access as a Basic User, Planner, or Scheduler in IGEMS. (T-1) Foreign Nationals are not allowed access to IGEMS-C. (T-1) 2.17.2.  MICT.   2.17.2.1.  MICT  is  the  Air  Force  program  of  record  to  communicate  a  unit’s  current status  of  SAC,  HAF  SAC  FRAGO  and  SII  compliance.  In  addition,  MICT  provides supervisors  and  the  command  chain,  from  squadron  commander  to  SecAF,  tiered visibility into user-selected compliance reports and program status, as well as indications of  program  health  across  Functional  and  command  channels.  Additionally,  MICT  can assist  IGs  by  informing  the  risk  based  sampling  strategy  and  formulating  specific inspection methodology and IG team composition for the CCIP and UEI Capstone Event. MICT also  helps  facilitate the SII and HAF SAC FRAGO programs  by  gathering time-sensitive data in an expeditious manner. 2.17.2.2.  Personal  Identifiable  Information  (PII),  HIPAA,  DoD  UCNI  and  classified information will not be entered into MICT. (T-0)  Medical Quality Assurance data (1102 protected)  can  be  entered  into  MICT  only  in  the  "1102  Protected"  hierarchy  of  SACs.  Commanders  will  ensure  that  it  is  treated  IAW  Privacy  Act  of  1974  and  Title  10  USC 1102, Medical Quality Assurance Records.  FOUO data is permitted in MICT.    2.17.2.3.  Self-Assessment Communicator (SAC).  A SAC is a two-way communication tool designed to improve compliance with published guidance and communicate risk and program health up and down the chain of command in near real-time.  Compliance with a SAC does not relieve individual Airmen from complying with all statutory and regulatory requirements in AFIs and directives at the local, state or federal level.   2.17.2.3.1.  Trusted  and  timely.    As  a  self-assessment  tool,  SACs  ask  commanders, supervisors, and Airmen at all levels of operations to self-report compliance and non-compliance.    While  the  responses  are  assumed  to  be  truthful  and  timely,  SACs  are frequently verified for accuracy and currency by Wing IGs and MAJCOM IGs. AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 39 2.17.2.3.2.  Cost-benefit  balance.    SAC  items  are  not  free.    The  cost  is  measured  in terms  of  Airmen’s  time  to  complete  the  assessment.    As  authors  add  line-items  to their SACs with compliance requirements from their publications, the benefits of the resulting assessments must outweigh the cost in Airmen’s time. 2.17.2.3.3.  Audiences.    Individual  SAC  line  items  should  be  written  for  one  of  the audiences  listed  below.    The  benefit  to  that  audience  must  outweigh  the  cost  in Airman’s time to complete the assessment. 2.17.2.3.3.1.  Higher  Headquarters  functional  staffs.    Assessment  data  allows functional staffs to gauge overall program health or policy effectiveness.   2.17.2.3.3.2.  Commanders.    Assessment  data  provides  indicators  of  program health or identifies high-risk areas. 2.17.2.3.3.3.  Shop-level Airmen.  Including an item in a SAC provides additional emphasis to assessors and aids in clarifying policy nuances or new requirements. 2.17.2.3.4.  Applicability and content.   2.17.2.3.4.1.  Any  AF  Publication  that  levies  Wing-level  (or  lower)  compliance, must have a SAC associated with  it unless there  are no wing-level  requirements that require real-time communication. 2.17.2.3.4.2.  The requirements from more than one AFI or AFI-directed program may  be  consolidated  into  a  single  SAC.    Conversely,  multiple  SACs  may  be written  for  a  single  AFI.    This  may  be  appropriate  for  AFIs  that  affect  multiple organizational  levels  within  a  Wing.    A  single  AFI  may  generate  a  SAC  for  a wing-level  program,  a  group-level  program,  a  squadron-level  and  a  work  center program.    Tailoring  communicators  to  the  specific  level  of  assessment  values Airmen’s time and provides data specific to that demographic. 2.17.2.3.4.3.  An  individual  compliance  item  will  not  be  referenced  in  multiple SACs  unless  it  applies  to  multiple  organizational  levels  (i.e.  Wing,  Group, Squadron). 2.17.2.3.4.4.  Every SAC line-item must be referenced to a wing-level (or below) compliance  item  in  Air  Force  Instructions  or  other  directive  publications,  and include  the  associated  tiering  as  it  appears  in  the  publication  (IAW  AFI  33-360 tier definitions).  2.17.2.3.4.5.  HAF  SAC  authors  will  only  reference  compliance  items  for  which their 2-letter is the approving official (e.g., an AF/A2 SAC may not include items from an AF/A1 AFI).  HAF SAC authors may also reference Tier 0 (higher than Air  Force-level)  compliance  items  from  policy  documents  for  which  the  2-letter has  been  assigned  responsibility  (e.g.,  an  AF/A10  SAC  may  include  nuclear DODI compliance items). 2.17.2.3.4.6.  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA/Centralized  Activity  staffs  will  write  SACs for  supplements  that  drive  wing-level  (or  lower)  compliance.  These  Self-Assessment Communicators will not include higher-level guidance (i.e. HAF or    40 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 DoD). For highly-specialized functions that are not represented by a HAF staff or FAM, MAJCOM/DRU/FOA functional managers may develop and publish SACs that include higher-level guidance. (or   When  written, 2.17.2.3.4.7.  Wings may write SACs for wing-level supplements that drive wing-level these  Self-Assessment Communicators  will  not  include  higher-level  guidance  (i.e.  NAF,  MAJCOM, HAF or DoD). (T-1) lower)  compliance. 2.17.2.3.5.  Publishing and updating. 2.17.2.3.5.1.  SAC authors will update new SACs within 10 days of posting a new publication  to  ePubs.    For  updated  publications  or  routine  SAC  updates,  SAC authors may only update or change SACs during scheduled quarterly updates (Jan 1, Apr 1, Jul 1, Oct 1) 2.17.2.3.5.2.  SAC  authors  will  review  each  of  their  SACs  annually  and  update the reviewed date in MICT. 2.17.2.3.5.3.  For  each  change  to  any  AFI,  the  SAC  author  will  update  any affected  SAC  line-items  at  the  quarterly  update  cycle  IAW  paragraph  2.17.2.3.5.1. 2.17.2.3.6.  Naming  Conventions.  All  SACs  will  use  one  of  the  following  naming conventions:  2.17.2.3.6.1.  When  using  a  single  AFI  as  the  reference  for  a  SAC,  the  HAF author will use the AFI number along with the long title of the AFI (e.g., “AFI 14-104 Oversight of Intelligence Activities”).  2.17.2.3.6.2.  When  placing  a  single  AFI’s  requirements  in  multiple  SACs,  and those  SACs  do  not  reference  other  AFIs,  then  add  a  descriptive  adjective  to  the end  of  the  title  (e.g.,  “AFI  90-301  IG  Complaints  Resolution  -  Reports  of Investigation”  and  “AFI  90-301  IG  Complaints  Resolution  -  Complaints Resolution Program”). 2.17.2.3.6.3.  When  naming  a  SAC  that  uses  multiple  AFIs  as  its  reference,  use the functional program name as the SAC title (e.g., Physical Security, Computer Security, etc.) 2.17.2.3.6.4.  When  naming  a  SAC  for  a  MAJCOM/FOA/DRU  supplement,  the naming  convention  will  follow  HAF  naming  convention  and  include  the MAJCOM  identifier  (e.g.,  “AFI  14-104  Oversight  of  Intelligence  Activities  – ACC Sup”) (T-2) 2.17.2.3.6.5.  When naming a SAC at the Wing level, the naming convention will follow  HAF  naming  convention  and  include  the  Wing  identifier  (e.g.,  “AFI  14-104 Oversight of Intelligence Activities – 341 MW Sup”).  (T-1) AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 41 Figure 2.3.  Self-Assessment Communicator Author Guide.  Self-Assessment Communicator (SAC) Author Guide  SACs are not inspection checklists    The Self-Assessment Communicator is not a listing of all compliance items identified in the corresponding AFI.  Do not use the SAC as a tool for preparing a unit to be inspected, as a job guide, or listing of daily activities of a program.  It is imperative that SAC authors are discerning when creating assessment items.  Compliance Items 1.  Does the benefit outweigh the cost for this item? Yes  No  2.  Is this information only available in MICT? 3. Do you or the intended audience have time to track this item? 4.  Can the intended audience make data-driven decisions from assessments of this item?       5.  Is this compliance item within your functional authority or “lane”? 6. Can the assessment item be answered with yes, no or N/A? If you answered “Yes” to all six (6) of these questions then this compliance item is a good candidate for inclusion in the SAC.     2.17.2.4.  Local  Checklists.  Local  checklists  are  flexible  tools  in  MICT  that  allow  unit commanders the ability to identify, manage, and track items or issues of non-compliance that  are  not  included  in  an  existing  HAF,  MAJCOM  or  local  SAC.  They  also  have  the ability  to  track  items  that  are  important  to  them  as  commanders  and  expand  their  self-assessment programs. Their use is optional.  2.17.2.4.1.  Cost-benefit  balance.  Local  Checklists  items  are  not  free.  The  cost  is measured  in  terms  of  Airmen’s  time  to  complete  the  checklist.  As  line-items  are added,  the  benefits  of  tracking  the  information  must  outweigh  the  cost  in  Airmen’s time. 2.17.2.4.2.  Restrictions  on  use.  Unlike  SACs,  there  are  no  restrictions  on  line-item content in Local Checklists. Commanders will pay judicious attention to the quantity of checklist items added, and the time spent tracking them. (T-1)  2.17.2.4.3.  At  no  time  will  Local  Checklists  be  used  in  lieu  of  SACs,  nor  will completion of a Local Checklist item fulfill the requirement to assess a SAC item. (T-1) 2.17.2.5.  Contractors may have access to MICT. 2.17.2.6.  Foreign National may have access to MICT. 2.17.3.  Gatekeeper Site 2.17.3.1.  The Air Force Gatekeeper Site is the only authorized Gatekeeping system and will be utilized by all MAJCOMs and Wing/Wing Equivalent IGS. (T-1)   42 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 2.17.3.2.  All  IGs  will  ensure  the  all  inspection  activities  (as  defined  in  paragraph  1.2.2),  at  a  minimum,  by  entered  into  the  Air  Force  Gatekeeper  Site.  (T-1)    For additionally  MAJCOM  requirements  see  paragraph  1.5.9.8  and  for  additional Wing/Wing Equivalent requirements see paragraph  5.9.2.5. 2.17.3.3.  MAJCOM  and  Wing/Wing  Equivalent  IGS  will  assign  in  writing,  at  a minimum,  one individual to  act  as their site administrator.  Assignment in  writing must be forwarded to the respective MAJCOM (for Wing/Wing Equivalent users) or AFIA (for MAJCOM users) administrator. 2.17.3.4.  Access management.  Access to the Air Force Gatekeeper Site will be managed by: 2.17.3.4.1.  MAJCOM administrators will be assigned by the AFIA administrator. 2.17.3.4.2.  MAJCOM users will be assigned by the MAJCOM administrator. 2.17.3.4.3.  Wing/Wing Equivalent administrators will be assigned by the MAJCOM administrator. 2.17.3.4.4.  Wing/Wing  Equivalent  users  will  be  assigned  by  the  Wing/Wing Equivalent administrator. (T-1) 2.17.3.5.  The website is not an official system of record, units must periodically back up their data and place it within their records management system. (T-0) 2.18.  Inspection Reports. 2.18.1.  Classification.    IGs  will  classify  and  mark  collateral  and  SCI  reports  IAW    DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2: DoD Information Security Program: Marking of Classified Information and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. Classify and mark SAP reports IAW DODM 5205.07, Volume 4. Special Access Program (SAP) Security Manual. (T-0) 2.18.2.  Report Marking.  At a minimum, mark unclassified inspection reports "For Official Use Only (FOUO)". Mark controlled unclassified information such as FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY    (FOUO)  IAW  DoDM  5200.01,  Volume  4,  DoD  Information  Security  Program: Controlled  Unclassified  Information  (CUI)IAW  DOM  5200.1-V2  and  AFI  31-401.    For nuclear inspection reporting requirements, see Chapter 6. (T-0) 2.18.3.  Releasability.    TIG  is  the  confidential  agent  of  SECAF  and  CSAF  for  obtaining uninhibited  self-analysis  and  self-criticism  of  the  internal  management,  operation,  and administration of the Air Force. Therefore, Air Force IG reports are internal memoranda and constitute  privileged  information  that  is  not  releasable  outside  the  Air  Force  except  with specific approval of TIG, or as outlined below.  Commanders will ensure that all requests for IG  reports,  or  extracts  therefrom,  originating  from  sources  outside  the  original  distribution, are referred to SAF/IGI for coordination and clearance. (T-1)  Classifications and restrictions on  the  disclosure  or  use  of  IG  reports  shall  be  strictly  observed.    (T-0)  (Note:  Medical inspection  data  may  be  additionally  protected  from  disclosure  under  10  USC  §  1102  and should not be released without review by appropriate medical risk management personnel). 2.18.3.1.  Release  Determination  Authority.    Before  releasing  inspection  reports  other than  NSI  reports  (all  types)  outside  DoD,  FOIA  offices  will  receive  a  final  release determination  from  SAF/IGI.  (T-1)    Non-DoD  parties  requesting  inspection  reports AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 43 should be referred to the appropriate FOIA office.  Release of NSI Reports is IAW CJCSI 3263.05B. 2.18.3.2.  Release  within  DoD.    DoD  members,  DoD  contractors,  consultants,  and grantees  are  permitted  access  to  inspection  reports  IAW  DOD  Regulation  5400.7-R/AFMAN  33-302.    MAJCOM  IGs  are  authorized  to  release  their  own  inspection reports,  in  whole  or  in  part,  within  DoD.    Courtesy  copy  SAF/IGI  on  any  inspection report released outside the Air Force except when the release is only to other parties on a Joint base. 2.18.3.3.  Release of Inspection Summary to News Media.  An inspection summary may be released for internal information or in response to news media queries in coordination with  public affairs.  Commanders will ensure that the summary is  limited to  the overall rating,  inspection  process/definition  and,  if  desired,  personal  comments  by  the commander  (e.g.  general  laudatory  comments,  perception  of  inspection  process).  (T-1)  Commanders  will  also  ensure  that  the  published  summary  does  not  contain  detailed information  (e.g.  sub-area  ratings,  a  list  of  individuals  recognized  by  the  IG,  specific deficiencies, or specific ratings for inspection criteria).   The use of HAF and MAJCOM Public Affairs Guidance are required IAW AFI 35-101. (T-1) 2.18.3.4.  Releasability Statement.  Commanders will ensure that the following statement appears  on  the  cover  and  each  page  of  the  report  as  well  as  in  any  transmission, presentation,  or  document  containing  protected  IG  material:    “For  Official  Use  Only.  This report may be protected from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.  Do not release or publish, in whole or in part, outside official DoD channels without express approval of the Director, SAF/IGI.”  Include similar statements on reports of inspections conducted jointly with inspection teams from other DoD agencies. (T-1) 2.18.4.  Disclosure of IG sources and methods. IGs at all levels will pay particular attention to  not  unintentionally  disclosing  IG  sources  and  methods  when  writing  inspection  reports.  Properly  validated  findings  are  meaningful  to  inspected  units;  how  the  finding  was discovered,  including  but  not  limited  to  survey  data  and  results,  ATIS  events,  performance observations,  and/or  virtual  inspections,  are  not  typically  important.    In  fact,  especially  in smaller  organizations,  disclosure  of  IG  sources  and  methods  may  lead  to  potential  reprisal allegations.  Therefore, do not include any sources and methods in any inspection reports. (T-1)   2.18.5.  Executive Summary. For UEI Capstones, IGs will send an executive summary NLT 5 work days after the IG team out-briefs, IAW Figure A6.1 to the inspected unit Commander and SAF/IGI, unless the final inspection report has already been published and distributed.  2.18.6.  Final  Inspection  Report.  NLT  30  days  after  the  IG  team  departs  the  inspected  unit, the MAJCOM IG will send the final  IG inspection report and notify organizations the final IG inspection report is available in IGEMS. 2.19.  Inspection Findings. 2.19.1.  IGs  will  ensure  all  inspection  reports  address  non-primary  inspection  activity deficiencies,  including  safety,  surety,  or  issues  of  military  discipline.  (T-1)  These  concerns may directly affect an overall inspection rating at the discretion of the inspection team chief and will be documented in the final inspection report, with  the exception of Nuclear Surety 44 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 Inspections  (NSIs).  (T-1)  IGs  will  ensure  inspection  reports  include  only  validated  data categorized  as  Bench  marks,  Strengths,  Deficiencies  or  Recommended  Improvement  Areas (RIA).  (T-1)  RIAs  will  not  be  used  to  document  procedural  deviations  or  non-compliance. (T-1)  RIAs  are  only  used  to  identify  areas  where  a  more  efficient  or  effective  course  of action is available. (T-1) 2.19.2.  Self-identified deficiencies.  One of the primary objectives of the AFIS is to foster a culture  of  critical  self-assessment  and  continuous  improvement,  and  to  reduce  reliance  on external  inspection  teams.    To  accomplish  that,  trust  must  be  built  between  commanders, Airmen and the IG, beginning with the shared goal of improving the unit’s effectiveness.  A key component to building and sustaining in AFIS is creating an environment where Airmen feel  they  can  safely  report  what’s  true,  not  what  they  believe  their  commander  or  the  IG expects  them  to  report.    Airmen  must  understand  their  command  chain  and  their commanders'  IG  teams  highly  value  honest  and  accurate  reporting.  (T-0)    To  that  end,  the following apply: 2.19.2.1.  Wing IGs. The responsibility for detecting non-compliance rests with the Wing Commander, subordinate commanders and supervisors. Wing IGs should document non-compliance  in  CCIP  inspection  reports  and  in  IGEMS.    Ratings  should  be  positively influenced  if  the  unit  accurately  identifies  and  reports  the  issue  through  the  Self-Assessment Program, even more so, if it is apparent the unit does this on a regular basis as part of their daily battle rhythm. 2.19.2.2.  MAJCOM  IGs.    A  UEI  is  a  multi-year,  continual  evaluation  of  the  unit’s effectiveness,  and  is  intended  to  help  the  Wing  Commander  understand  the  areas  of greatest  risk  from  undetected  non-compliance.  MAJCOM  IGs  will  document  areas  of significant or systemic undetected non-compliance in the UEI Capstone Report and enter into  IGEMS.    Scoring  of  Wing  CCIP  will  be  positively  influenced  if  the  unit  CCIP accurately  detects  and  reports  in  a  systematic  way  to  enable  the  command  chain  to  do root-cause analysis and apply corrective actions. 2.19.3.  Safety, Health and Security.  Safety and Health are integral parts of every inspection.  Inspectors  will  assess  safety  and  health  procedures  and  workplace  hazards  during  all inspections;  notify  the  appropriate  commander,  bio-environmental,  medical,  and  safety offices (as appropriate) of concerns; and document the report, as required. (T-1)  In addition, inspectors  will  stop  an  operation  or  task  if  conditions  are  detected  that  would  jeopardize safety, security, or cause equipment damage. (T-1) 2.19.4.  Surety.  Nuclear  surety,  at  nuclear  capable  units,  is  always  subject  to  inspection during any IG inspection. Inspectors will ensure a potential nuclear surety deficiency will be brought  to  the immediate attention of the inspection team  chief.  (T-1).   In the event  the  IG determines an unsatisfactory condition exists, as described in CJCSI 3263.05B, or surety is at risk, the Team  Chief should  notify the appropriate levels  of command and refer to  AFI 13-503, Nuclear-Capable Unit Certification, Decertification and Restriction Program.  2.19.5.  Benchmarks.    Benchmarks  are  submitted  by  inspection  teams  and  approved  by  the MFM and HAF FAM.  The IG team chief approves or rejects the submission, while the HAF FAM has final authority to approve or reject the benchmark.   IG teams process benchmarks as follows: AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 45 2.19.5.1.  Inspectors  or  Inspection  Augmentees,  who  are  Subject  Matter  Experts  (SME) on  an  IG  team,  may  identify  potential  benchmarks  during  the  normal  course  of conducting  inspections.    SMEs  will  gain  approval  for  benchmark  submissions  from  the IG team chief prior to finalizing it in the inspection report. (T-1) 2.19.5.2.  After  the  IG  team  chief  authorizes  a  submission,  the  SME  must  formally submit  the  benchmark  through  their  chain  of  command  and  the  functional  chain  for further  approvals.  (T-1)      The  SME  will  follow  the  specific  instructions  on  the  AFIA SharePoint site: https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afia/Benchmarks/default.aspx. (T-1)   2.19.5.3.  The  normal  flow  of  approval  is  Wing  to  MAJCOM  to  HAF  (or  Agency).    In order to keep the appropriate Functional and leadership chains involved, Wings must not send approval requests directly to HAF FAMs.  When forwarding a benchmark approval request  to  the  MFM,  Wings  must  also  info  their  MAJCOM  IG.  (T-1)  The  MFM,  in coordination with the MAJCOM IG, forwards the submission to the HAF FAM. 2.19.5.4.  The  SME  will  e-mail  the  proposed  benchmark  to  the  IG  and  FAM/MFM  one organizational level higher than the IG team accomplishing the inspection. (T-1) The IG team chief should accomplish this task during the course of the inspection, but not later than  30  days  after  the  inspection  was  conducted.    FAMs/MFMs  have  30  days  from submission  of  a  benchmark  to  determine  if  they  will  take  further  steps  to  fully  validate the  submission  and  include  it  in  their  next  update  to  policy  or  other  guidance,  or  to further develop and formally submit the benchmark as an idea using procedures outlined in AFI 38-402, Airmen Powered by Innovation Program. 2.19.5.5.  Approved Benchmark Procedures.  If accepted, the FAM should take necessary steps  to  institutionalize  the  benchmark  within  1-year  of  submission.  In  addition  to updating the appropriate AFI(s), SACs and other guidance, the FAM will notify SAF/IG of pending changes to Attachment 3 of this publication as applicable. 2.19.5.6.  Rejected Benchmark Procedures.  If the Benchmark submission is rejected, the FAM/MFM will take no further steps to  validate the submission.  The FAM/MFM must provide justification via email or other suitable method to the sponsoring IG team chief if rejecting a proposed benchmark.  IG team SMEs will follow up to determine the status if the FAM takes no action within 30 days of submission. (T-1) 2.19.6.  Validation. MAJCOM and Wing IGs will establish a validation process that provides the inspected unit, or the organization that owns the finding, the opportunity to clarify and/or provide  additional  information  in  a  timely  manner  for  any  potential  deficiencies  identified during  the  inspection.  (T-1)  The  IG  Team  Chief,  in  coordination  with  the  unit  under inspection, will coordinate with the appropriate FAMs on critical and significant deficiencies identified  during  the  inspection.  (T-1)  All  potential  Safety  deficiencies,  regardless  of severity,  will  be  coordinated  with  the  appropriate  Safety  FAM.  (T-1)    This  process  also applies  to  deficiencies  levied  against  other  Wings,  MAJCOM  units  or  HHQ  organizations. (T-1) 2.19.6.1.  When  the  IG  determines  the  need  for  external  validation  of  a  potential deficiency, inspectors will validate with the appropriate SME at the lowest possible level, but  no  higher  than  the  appropriate  FAM  at  the  IG’s  organizational  level:  Wing  IGs validate  with  Wing  FAMs IGs  validate  with available;  MAJCOM if 46 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 MAJCOM/ANG/FOA/DRU,  centralized  functional  activity  or  organizations  with  whom the IG team has a memorandum of agreement. (T-1) MAJCOM/ANG/FOA/DRU FAMs will  consult  with  the  appropriate  HAF  Functional  to  ensure  proper  interpretation  of  Air Force (or higher) policy. 2.19.6.2.  FAMs  or  other  SMEs  will  clarify  policy  and  procedures,  or  validate  that  a potential  deficiency  does/does  not  comply  with  policy,  and  will  not  provide input/comment on the severity of a validated deficiency; that responsibility resides with the IG. (T-0) 2.19.6.3.  Oversight  Deficiencies.    IGs  are  not  required  to  validate  deficiencies  beyond the  appropriate  FAMs  or  agencies  with  which  the  IG  has  MOA/Memorandum  of Understanding  for  validation  support.    If  an  external  oversight  team  independently validates  with  the  HAF  Functional  and  receives  contradictory  information,  a  deficiency may be levied against the MAJCOM and/or HAF Functional.  2.19.6.4.  Inspectors will ensure that all validated findings will be documented in the IG’s report, and entered and assigned in IGEMS. (T-1)  2.19.7.  Deficiency  Cause  Codes.  Corrective  action  OPRs  will  assign  Deficiency  Cause Codes to all deficiencies in IGEMS IAW Attachment 7. (T-1) 2.19.8.  Deficiencies  External  to  the  Inspected  Unit.    When  a  Wing  or  MAJCOM  IG  is considering  writing  a  deficiency  against  an  organization  outside  their  organization  (wing, MAJCOM, ANG, or FOA/DRU), the inspecting IG team chief will notify the owning IG of the  potential  deficiency  and  validation  details  (or  AFIA  for  Air  Staff  and  non-Air  Force deficiencies).    If  applicable,  courtesy  copy  both  the  tenant  and  host  base  unit  soonest, preferably  during  the  inspection  but  NLT  five  duty  days  after  the  completion  of  the inspection  (or  by  next  scheduled  UTA  for  ARC  units).  (T-1)    If  possible,  validate  each deficiency with the potential Corrective Action OPR and gain concurrence that the OPR will accept  the  deficiency;  however,  Corrective  Action  OPR  concurrence  with  deficiency assignment  or  wording  is  not  required.    Once  validated,  the  owning  IG  (or  AFIA)  will  be responsible for tracking status and notifying the inspecting IG when closed.   In cases where a conflict occurs between the closure authority and the inspection authority, differences will be  resolved  between  the  next  higher  levels  within  the  IG  chain.    If  MAJCOM  IGs  cannot resolve the  conflict,  the  AFIA commander will broker  a resolution.    In instances where the inspection  involves  associate  units,  coordination  between  the  associated  and  associating units’  IGs  on  how  deficiencies  are  assigned,  assessed,  and  resolved  is  essential  to  ensuring timely resolution.  (T-1) 2.19.9.  IGs will ensure deficiency write-ups include: 2.19.9.1.  Be assigned a unique tracking number. (T-1) 2.19.9.2.  Describe, in sufficient detail, the deficiency and contextual facts as necessary to clearly convey the defect requiring resolution. (T-1) The written description alone should be adequate for the inspected party to begin corrective action planning.  2.19.9.3.  Be assigned a  deficiency severity of CRITICAL, SIGNIFICANT, or MINOR. (T-1) AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 47 2.19.9.4.  Reference documentation. (T-1) the  applicable instruction, technical  order  or  other  source 2.19.9.5.  Address  impact  of  continued  deviation  or  non-compliance  for  critical deficiencies. (T-1) 2.19.9.6.  Identify the Corrective Action OPR charged with resolving the deficiency.  (T-1) Identify the additional Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR), if applicable. (T-1) 2.19.9.7.  Deficiencies  that  involve  hosts/tenants  outside  the  inspected  unit’s  chain-of-command,  HHQ,  other  MAJCOMs,  DRU/FOA,  HAF  or  non-Air  Force  entities  will  be categorized as HHQ/Support Agency Deficiencies.  (T-1) 2.19.9.8.  Identify  functional  managers  at  the  IG’s  organizational  level  for  CRITICAL, SIGNIFICANT  and NSI repeat  MINOR deficiencies, as  well as Strengths  and RIAs, to assist the corrective action process or for awareness in policy execution and adherence, as applicable. (T-1) 2.19.9.9.  Identify the Functional Area for all deficiencies, in addition to Strengths, RIAs, and Benchmarks to enable functional analysis and feedback. 2.19.10.  Deficiency Corrective Actions.   2.19.10.1.  Corrective action plans (CAPs) are the deficiency corrective action data which at  a  minimum  includes  root-cause(s),  Deficiency  Cause  Code(s)  assigned  from Attachment  7,  countermeasures,  OPRs  and  ECDs  to  closure.  CAPs  are  required  for CRITICAL, SIGNIFICANT and NSI repeat MINOR deficiencies. IGs will document this data  in  IGEMS.  (T-1)  CAP  approval  authority  must  approve,  modify  or  reject  with constructive comments within 15 days of receipt (30 days for ANG). (T-1) 2.19.10.1.1.  Root Cause Analysis. Problem-solving responsibility  and the corrective action  process  reside  at  the  lowest  appropriate  command  level.  Commanders  will ensure RCA is completed for all deficiencies using the problem-solving approach/tool and  level  of  effort  best  suited  to  the  situation.  (T-1)  Commanders  should  consider using  the  rigor  of  the  Continuous  Process  Improvement  program  for  CRITICAL, SIGNIFICANT,  and  NSI  repeat  MINOR  deficiencies  to  determine  primary,  and  if applicable, contributing root causes. 2.19.10.2.  MAJCOM  IGs  will  track  to  closure  CRITICAL,  SIGNIFICANT  and  NSI repeat MINOR deficiencies documented by MAJCOM IGs. MAJCOM IGs will provide the  inspected  unit  with  reply  instructions.  The  inspected  unit  will  provide  associated CAPs  to  MAJCOM  IGs  and  the  FAM  or  MFM  OPR  NLT  45  days  (90  days  for  ARC units) after assigned in IGEMS. (T-1)  2.19.10.2.1.  Wing  Commanders  will  ensure  minor  deficiencies  assessed  during  an external  inspection  are  closed  at  or  below  the  wing  level.  (T-1)  The  inspected  unit will  provide  associated  CAPs  to  Wing  IGs  NLT  45  days  (90  days  for  ARC  units) after assigned in IGEMS. (T-1) 2.19.10.2.2.  The  CAP  OPR  will  report  status  of  open  deficiencies  requiring MAJCOM IG tracking to the MAJCOM IG quarterly in IGEMS or IGEMS-C. (T-2)  48 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 2.19.10.2.3.  MAJCOM  IGs  may  close  the  deficiency  when  the  CAP  is  entered  in IGEMS  or  IGEMS-C,  is  fully  implemented  and  the  results  of  the  plan  have  been validated by the Wing IG.  2.19.10.2.4.  MAJCOM IGs will validate CAPs prior to closing deficiencies assessed to the MAJCOM.  2.19.10.3.  Wing  IGs  will  track  to  closure  all  deficiencies  documented  by  Wing  IG reports  and  provide  the  inspected  unit  with  reply  instructions.  (T-1)  The  inspected  unit will  provide  associated  CAPs  to Wing  IGs  NLT  45  days  (90  days  for  ARC  units)  after assigned in IGEMS. (T-1)  2.19.10.3.1.  Wing Commanders will determine deficiency closure authority for Wing IG  identified  deficiencies,  unless  the  deficiency  is  levied  against  the  Centralized Activities, NAF, MAJCOM or HAF. (T-1) 2.19.10.3.2.  MAJCOM IGs will validate CAPs prior to closing deficiencies assessed to the MAJCOM.  2.19.10.4.  All deficiencies should be closed within 12 months (18 months for ARC).  2.19.10.5.  In instances where corrective action responsibility is assigned to both the host and tenant unit (or supported and supporting unit), IGs will assign an OPR and an OCR to correct the identified deficiencies. (T-1)  2.19.10.6.  Deficiencies that contain potential Fraud, Waste or Abuse will be highlighted in  301inspection  reports  and  forwarded  to  the  MAJCOM  IG  for  semi-annual  reporting IAW AFI 90-301, The Inspector General Complaints Resolution Program. (T-1)  2.19.10.7.  Wing  and  MAJCOM  IGs  will  utilize  IGEMS  to  assign  all  HAF-level  (Air Staff  and  non-Air  Force)  deficiencies  to  AFIA  for  deficiency  processing  and  include personnel  who  participated  in  deficiency  validation.  (T-1)  AFIA  will  forward  the deficiency  and  CAP  requirements  to  the  responsible  HAF-level  office  (O-6/GS equivalent or above) for action or comment and copy the MAJCOM IG. (T-1) OPRs will upload  CAPs  in  IGEMS  or  forward  it  electronically  to  AFIA  and  the  MAJCOM  IG  in enough  detail  to  evaluate  whether  to  close  the  deficiency  or  keep  it  open.  If  corrective action  is  not  complete,  AFIA  will  follow  up  with  the  corrective  action  OPRs  for  status updates.  (T-1)  When  appropriate,  AFIA  will  close  the  deficiency  in  IGEMS  in coordination with the MAJCOM IG. (T-1) 2.19.10.8.  Adequacy Deficiencies. The Air Staff/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/ANG Functional OPR will provide associated corrective action plans for all CRITICAL, SIGNIFICANT, and  MINOR  Adequacy  Deficiencies  to  MAJCOM  IGs  NLT  45  days  (90  days  for  ARC staffs) after assigned in IGEMS. (T-1) Recommended Improvement Areas (RIAs) under Adequacy must be officially acknowledged by assigned FAM/MFM OPR in reply to the applicable MAJCOM/IG, but no definitive action or follow up is required. Any recorded method  of for  RIA acknowledgements. acknowledgement (email,  memo, etc.) is sufficient 2.19.11.  DELETED 2.19.12.  Deficiency Fix Rate (DFR). MAJCOM IGs, Wing IGs and AFIA will monitor DFR for all identified CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies. (T-1) DFR is a key measure of AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 49 performance to show the average number of days required to close a deficiency.  The DFR clock starts on the date the final report is signed and published.  The DFR clock stops when the deficiency is closed.  For a long-term deficiency (one in which the fix runs through the Future Years Defense Plan), once the proper mitigation is in place to effectively manage the deficiency risk, deficiency closure may be appropriate. (T-1) 2.19.13.  The Deficiency Cause Codes listed in Attachment 7 apply to all inspections listed in  this  AFI.    Assign  all  Deficiency  Cause  Codes  required  to  describe  the  deficiency.  Commonly, more than one Deficiency Cause Code will be applicable.    NOTE: If the code “OT” (Other) is used, IGs will ensure that a full description is included. (T-1) 2.19.14.  IGEMS  has  the  capability  to  report  “REPEAT  DEFICIENCIES”.    The  customer checks  “Repeat  Deficiency”  and  the  final  report  will  automatically  generate    “REPEAT DEFICIENCY” at the beginning of the write-up.   2.20.  Inspection Outbrief.  The IG, in coordination with the Wing Commander, will determine the timing, location, and format of the inspection outbrief.  Because CCIP is the cornerstone of AFIS, a mass outbrief has little value added and encourages legacy mindset.  Therefore, the UEI outbrief will typically be a one-on-one meeting with the wing commander or with a very small leadership audience.  Inspection outbriefs do not have to be in person, it is up to each MAJCOM IG to determine the best format with their available resources. 2.20.1.  Inspection  outbriefs  are  considered  a  version  of  the  inspection  report  and consequently  fall  within  releasability  restrictions.    DoD  members,  contractors,  consultants, and  grantees  are  permitted  to  attend  inspection  outbriefs  at  the  discretion  of  the  unit commander  if  part  of  the  very  small  leadership  audience;  however,  community  leaders  and the general public are not authorized access to inspection results, to include outbriefs, except as permitted by DOD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302 (see paragraph  2.18.3) 2.21.  The Air Force Inspection System Governance Process. 2.21.1.  The governance process is executed by three groups shown in  Figure 2.4. SAF/IGI will ensure charters for each of the groups contain detailed duties and functions. Figure 2.4.  Air Force Inspection System Governance Process.  50 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 2.21.1.1.  Inspection System Working Group (ISWG). The ISWG meets semi-annually to discuss  the  adequacy  of  the  AFIS  and  proposals  for  improving  the  AFIS.

The  ISWG  will  vet  proposals  and  track  action  items  for  consideration  by  the Inspector General Advisory Board (IGAB) and/or the Inspection System Council (ISC). 2.21.1.2.  Inspector General Advisory Board (IGAB).  The IGAB meets semi-annually to discuss issues forwarded by the ISWG and any other inspection related business deemed appropriate  for  this  forum.    SAF/IG  chairs  the  IGAB,  comprised  of  key  2-letter Functionals, or their Deputies.  SAF/IGI is the Executive Secretary for the IGAB.   2.21.1.3.  Inspection  System  Council  (ISC).  The  ISC  meets  as  required  in  conjunction with  existing  MAJCOM/CV  meetings  to  discuss  any  inspection  related  business  and  to approve/disapprove  suggestions  for  improving  the  AFIS  submitted  by  the  ISWG  or IGAB.  SAF/IG  chairs  the  ISC,  comprised  of  MAJCOM/CVs  and  selected  FOA/DRU Commanders. SAF/IGI is the Executive Secretary for the ISC. 2.21.2.  Process  to  Change  List  of  Authorized  Inspections  (Attachment  2)  or  Inspection Requirements (Attachment 3).  Air Force agencies should submit requests to change, add or subtract an inspection activity listed in Attachment 2, or an inspection requirement listed in Attachment  3,  to  the  appropriate  HAF  2-letter  for  coordination.    AF/JA  will  determine  all JA  Functional  inspection  requirements.  HAF  2-letters  may  submit  the  recommendation  to SAF/IGI  at  usaf.pentagon.saf-ig.mbx.saf-igi-workflow@mail.mil  for  vetting  through  the AFIS  Governance  Process.

Inspection System to SAF/IGI at AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 51 Chapter 3 THE MANAGEMENT INSPECTION (MI) 3.1.  Introduction.  The MI is an above Wing-level (SAF/HAF/MAJCOM/NAF) inspection.  It is designed for Management Headquarter organizations that have multiple Wing-level or higher organizations reporting to it (Example: Numbered Air Force, MAJCOM, DRU and HAF staffs).   FOAs can receive an MI upon TIG direction, in addition to any normally scheduled UEI. The MI is based on fundamental principles of a well-managed organization and uses benchmark industry criteria to gauge the level of an organization’s performance excellence.   3.1.1.  MAJCOM  IGs  may  conduct  an  MI  on  their  subordinate  organizations  (MAJCOM Directorates,  NAF,  FOAs,  etc.)  using  AFIA’s  checklist,  methodology,  and  grading  criteria and  inspectors  that  are  MI-certified  IAW  AFIA  criteria.    AFIA  will  conduct  MIs  on MAJCOM  staffs  as  a  whole.  MAJCOM  directors  will  coordinate  with  AFIA/ET  prior  to scheduling initial MIs. 3.2.  Purpose.  The purpose of the MI is to inspect the performance of the organization in respect to the authority granted (example: Mission Directive) to perform the mission and the respective outputs  and/or  outcomes  of  the  products  produced  and  or  services  provided.    It  is  this  area between the mission and output/outcome that drives the MI focus.  The inspection will look back as far as required to measure organizational effectiveness. 3.3.  Execution.  AFIA  will  ensure  all  MAJCOMs,  SAF/HAF  DCS  Staffs  and  some  Direct Reporting  Units  receive  a  Management  Inspection  within  a  4  year  inspection  cycle.  (T-1) MAJCOM  IGs  may  provide  MI  below  the  directorate  in  accordance  with  MAJCOM/CC Inspection  program.  During  the  inspection  cycle,  at  least  two  continuous  evaluations  will  be conducted  as  an  on-site  visit  (OSV)  or  virtually.  (T-1)  All  inspections  will  be  loaded  into Gatekeeper at least one year in  advance and a notification letter sent to  DCSs, Commanders or Directors sixty days prior to the inspection. (T-1) 3.3.1.  MIs  are  initiated  virtually  by  inspecting  documents  received  from  a  data  call  to  the organization,  and  direct  data  pulls  from  the  AF  Portal  or  other  means.    The  MI  culminates with  on-site  validation/verification  of  potential  findings  which  are  then  provided  in  a  final report.    A  draft  report  is  given  to  the  Commander/Director  of  the  organization  before  the team departs.  3.3.2.  As part of the inspection process, the inspection team will send an approved survey to all members of the inspected organization.  Upon receipt of survey responses, the team will analyze responses and develop subsequent “boots-on-ground” interview questions. 3.3.3.  Senior  leader  and  customer  interviews  will  be  conducted  with  the  owning headquarters organization to discuss their perspectives on the inspected organization.  This is followed up with subordinate organization and/or customer interviews, contacting as many as necessary prior to visiting the inspected organization. 3.3.4.  Pre-scheduled  Functional  and  Airman-To-IG  Sessions  –  Group  and  -  Individual (ATIS-G/ATIS-I) will be conducted on-site after the initial  introductions and inspection in-brief  are  completed.    Everything  said  during  ATIS-G/ATIS-I  sessions  is  a  protected  IG communications.  Anything communicated to an IG member during ATIS-G/ATIS-I sessions 52 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 is  protected  from  reprisal  by  federal  law  under  Title  10  of  the  United  States  Code.    It  is illegal  for  anyone  to  take  any  adverse  personnel  action  against  a  member  for  protected communications  with  an  IG  member.    Compliance-oriented  By-Law  items  will  also  be inspected in addition to Functional and ATIS sessions.  3.3.5.  A draft final report will be prepared and delivered to the organization’s leadership in conjunction with the final outbrief, detailing ratings for each of the 7 MGA’s as well as any Deficiencies, Recommended Improvement Areas and Strengths confirmed by the inspection team  during the on-site  visit.   The final  report will  not  reveal  any survey or ATIS-G/I data disaggregated  below  the  organizational  level,  in  order  to  protect  individual  anonymity.   Additionally, comply with all inspection report guidance found in Chapter 2.  Note that the Team Chief has final decision authority for the grades and ratings assigned during an MI. 3.4.  Rating.  Overall management performance is rated using a two-tiered scale of EFFECTIVE or  INEFFECTIVE.    The  management  MGAs  are  rated  with  the  three-tier  scale  of  HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, EFFECTIVE or INEFFECTIVE, defined as the following: 3.4.1.  HIGHLY  EFFECTIVE  –  The  rating  given  to  indicate  performance  or  operations exceed mission requirements. Procedures and activities are carried out in a superior manner. Resources  and  programs  are  very  efficiently  managed  and  relatively  deficiency-free.  Risk- based criteria are often applied when allocating resources and making decisions. Root-cause analysis is often used to find and fix problems. 3.4.2.  EFFECTIVE  –  The  rating  given  to  indicate  performance  or  operations  meet expectations  and  mission  requirements.  Procedures  and  activities  are  carried  out  in    an effective  and  efficient  manner.  Programs  and  processes  are  measured  and  repeatable.  Risk- based  criteria  are  usually  applied  when  allocating  resources  and  making  decisions.  Root- cause analysis is usually used to find and fix problems. Deficiencies exist that do not impede or limit mission accomplishment. 3.4.3.  INEFFECTIVE  –  The  rating  given  to  indicate  performance  or  operation  needs significant improvement. Procedures and activities are not carried out in a competent manner, or  produce  unreliable  results.  Resources  and  programs  are  not  well  managed.    Risk  and resource  scarcity  is  rarely  considered  in  decision-making  processes.  No  effort  at  increasing efficiency  or  reliability  is  evident.  Deficiencies  exist  that  impede  or  limit  mission accomplishment. 3.5.  Air Force Management Inspection MGAs.  The MI inspects the following 7 MGAs: 3.5.1.  Strategic  Planning.    Air  Force  strategic  planning  is  a  process  which  begins  with  the Commander’s  or  Director’s  understanding  of  Air  Force  strategic  planning  guidance,  as  it applies to  the organization’s mission.  Strategic thinking and planning enables the planning team  to  conceive  and  articulate  the  organization’s  vision,  mission,  priorities,  goals,  and objectives  in  an  approved  strategic  plan.    The  strategic  plan  becomes  the  overarching playbook that defines and guides subordinate organization plans. 3.5.1.1.  Communicates Commander’s intent. 3.5.1.2.  Aligns the organization to common direction, focus, goals, metrics, and actions. 3.5.1.3.  Aligns resources. 3.5.1.4.  Assigns accountability and responsibility. AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 53 3.5.1.5.  Cascades  throughout  the  levels  of  the  organization    -  shows  how  each  level’s mission, priorities, metrics, and objectives  support the parent organization. 3.5.1.6.  Uses  a  systems  approach  that  requires  alignment  and  integration  of  people, processes, and strategy. 3.5.2.  Organizational Management.  Senior leaders throughout the organization establish and maintain  a  culture  of  customer  engagement,  develop  the  organization’s  future  leaders,  and recognize and reward contributions by workforce members. Leadership: 3.5.2.1.  Addresses  the  need  for  a  responsible,  informed,  transparent,  and  accountable governance or advisory body that can protect the interest of key stakeholders. 3.5.2.2.  Ensures  organizational governance is independent in review and audit functions, as well as a function that monitors organizational and Commander/Director performance. 3.5.2.3.  Ensures  performance  management  and  improvement  is  addressing  (1)  the  need for ethical behavior, (2) all legal and regulatory requirements, and (3) risk factors. 3.5.2.4.  Clearly communicates mission, vision, and goals throughout the organization. 3.5.2.5.  Drives strategy planning then deploys the strategy. 3.5.2.6.  Leads  change  and  communicates  to  the  organization  they  must  manage  the change, not assume it will happen. 3.5.2.7.  Empowers subordinates, grants full authority, and optimizes available resources to accomplish the mission. 3.5.2.8.  Commits  to  and  has  oversight  of  a  standardized  method  and  mindset  for reducing  waste  in  all  of  the  processes  used  to  execute  the  mission,  to  include  feedback from  those executing policy  and  guidance  - an  endless pursuit  to  identify and eliminate waste, adapt to change, and practice Continuous Process Improvement (CPI). 3.5.2.9.  Sustains a culture of CPI. 3.5.2.10.  Maintains oversight of the CCIP or Self-Assessment Program. 3.5.2.11.  Maintains fiscal responsibility. 3.5.2.12.  Maintains oversight of a risk management program. 3.5.2.13.  Stays  abreast  of    the  organization’s  climate  by  using  formal  and  informal methods for assessing morale. 3.5.3.  Customers.    The  value  of  the  organization’s  product  or  service  is  determined  by  the customer who is  the recipient of the output. Organizations must engage their customers for long-term  success,  including  listening  to  the  voice  of  the  customer,  building  customer relationships,  and  using  customer  information  to  improve  and  identify  opportunities  for innovation. 3.5.3.1.  Voice  of  the  Customer  (VOC).    Selection  of  VOC  strategies  depends  upon  the organization construct.  To effectively listen to and learn from customers, there must be a close link with the overall strategy of the organization.  3.5.3.2.  Customer  Engagement  (CE).    CE  is  strategic  action  focused  on  building relationships and managing complaints. Complaint aggregation, analysis, and root-cause 54 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 determination should lead to effective elimination of the causes of complaints and to the setting of priorities for process and product/service improvements. 3.5.3.3.  Adequacy.  The Adequacy portion of the Customers MGA will assess MAJCOM or SAF/HAF overall functional programs addressing resource issues in subordinate units.  Commanders  are  entrusted  with  resources  to  accomplish  a  stated  mission.    Those resources  include:  manpower,  funds,  equipment,  facilities  and  environment,  guidance, and  Airmen’s  time.  As  part  of  managing  their  resources,  higher  echelon  commanders must ensure adequate resources are provided to subordinate commanders.  This includes all of the aforementioned resources, plus a commander’s intent. 3.5.4.  Process  Operations.    The  focus  of  this  MGA  is  the  design,  management,  and improvement of Key Work Processes (KWPs).  KWPs are linked activities with the purpose of producing a stated output/outcome.  These activities rarely operate in  isolation and must be considered in relation to other processes that impact them.  The method in which a KWP's performance is measured is fundamental to a high-performing management system. 3.5.4.1.  Controls.    Controls  are  in-process  measurements  of  critical  points  that  should occur as early as possible to minimize problems and costs that may result from deviations from  expected  performance,  e.g.,  risk  mitigation.    Controls  manage  or  mitigate meaningful, acceptable risks when functioning as intended. 3.5.4.2.  Results.    Process  results  provide  key  information  for  analysis  and  review  of organizational performance and should address key operational requirements. 3.5.4.3.  The organization should have access to certified facilitators, including AFSO-21 if available, to educate and support all CPI efforts. 3.5.4.4.  The  organization  should  provide  evidence  of  problem  solving  self-assessment findings, e.g., the AFSO-21 8-Step-Problem-Solving methodology. 3.5.5.  Resources.    The  efficient  and  effective  deployment  of  an  organization's  resources when  and  where  they  are  needed  is  a  primary  foundational  management  principle.    Such resources  include  financial  resources,  inventory,  manpower,  tools  and  equipment,  facilities, specialized human skills, production materials, and information technology (IT).   While no single process, technique or philosophy can be singled out as the best approach for allocating resources,  it  is  crucial  that  detailed  resource  allocation  planning,  execution  and  monitoring continually take place.  3.5.5.1.  Financial  Plan.    All  resources  should  be  addressed  in  the  Financial  Plan  and demonstrate  financial  sustainability  of  the  organization.    Financial  planning  projects, prioritizes,  and  plans  the  expenditures  for  the  mission  area  to  drive  informed  decisions that support the mission, assess risk, and focus on cost as opposed to budget, as a primary measure of performance.  3.5.5.2.  Manpower  resources  are  addressed  in  the  Unit  Manpower  Document,  Unit Personnel Managment Roster, Alpha  and/or Unit Rosters (one each for civilian, military, and  contractor),  and  the  organizational  chart.  All  are  inspected  for  any  disconnects amongst  the  documents,  such  as  mismatches,  double  billets,  etc.    If  there  are  any mismatches  or  variations  of  personnel  assigned,  the  IG  will  evaluate  the  commander's decision-making process for making the change. AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 55 3.5.5.3.  Continuum of Learning.  Comprised of education, training, and experience. The organization should be current in the levels of training required pursuant to competencies in accomplishing the mission. 3.5.6.  Data-Driven  Decisions.    Central  to  making  informed  decisions  is  using  data  and information  that  is  reliable,  quality-based,  and  available.    How  the  organization  selects  and uses  data  and  information  in  decision-making  is  critical  to  the  achievement  of  key organizational  results  and  strategic  objectives,  to  anticipating  and  responding  to  rapid  or unexpected organizational or external changes, and to identifying best practices to share. 3.5.6.1.  The  organization  will  be  inspected  on  its  ability  to  establish  metrics  and decision-making;  its  ability  to  identify,  evaluate,  and  assimilate  data/information  from multiple streams, and its ability to differentiate information according to its utility and its uses of information to influence actions and decisions.  3.5.7.  Organizational  Performance.    Organizations  must  be  both  effective  and  efficient  in order to be successful.  Table 3.1.  Effectiveness and Efficiency. Effectiveness Doing the right things – encourages innovation Constantly measures if the actual output meets the desired output Focuses on achieving the “end” goal – takes into consideration any variables that may change in the future Keeps long-term strategy in mind & is adaptable to changing environments Looks at gaining success   Efficiency Doing things in the right manner – demands documentation and repetition of the same steps Output to input ratio – focuses on getting the maximum output with minimum resources Focuses on the process – importance given to the “means” of doing things Present state or the “status quo” Requires discipline and rigor Looks at avoiding mistakes or errors 3.5.7.1.  The  output  or  outcome  is  a  direct  link  to  the  Mission  Directive  and  Mission Statement. Table 3.2.  Output and Outcome. Output What the org does and who they reach  What is created at the end of a process Typically tangible and more easily measured objectively The quality, timeliness, and quantity of outputs contributes to outcomes Outcome Level of performance or achievement - impacts  Associated with the process or output Quantification of performance and assessment of the success of the process Difficult to measure - typically measured subjectively by approximation Answers, “what difference did it make?”  3.5.7.2.  The  organization  is  expected  to  function  within  its  authority,  work  within  its scope, and not duplicate a role of another organization or section internal to itself. 56 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 3.6.  Self-Assessment. 3.6.1.  Organization leadership has the legal authority and responsibility to inspect their sub-organizations.    A  robust  self-assessment  program  can  find  and  mitigate  deficiencies  or weaknesses  and  improve  the  organization’s  ability  to  produce  the  most  efficient,  effective, economical  and  disciplined  outputs  and  outcomes.    The  ability  of  individual  airmen  to monitor and regularly report on the compliance  of their processes with  applicable guidance via standardized checklists or standardized reporting tools offer a well-structured approach to a  robust  self-assessment  program.    Independent  verification  of  these  assessments  provides leadership  with  confidence  in  their  accuracy  and  validity.    Such  validated  findings  should then drive a root-cause analysis process which will feed improvements back into the strategic planning,  organizational  management,  data-driven  decision-making  and  other  key management principles. 3.6.2.  All  organizations  will  have  a  Self-Assessment  Program  IAW  AFI  1-2.  HAF, MAJCOM, NAFs, FOAs and DRUs will develop and document a structured Self-Assessment Program.  Recommend  the  CCIP  guidelines  in  Chapter  5  be  considered  for  developing  an organization’s  customized  SAP  using  either  the  four  UEI  MGAs  or  the  seven  MI  MGAs. NOTE:  All wing and wing equivalents, as defined in paragraph 2.2., must implement CCIP using the MGAs of the UEI as defined in Chapter 4. (T-1) Wing and wing equivalents with nuclear  capable  units  must  also  implement  CCIP  using  the  MGAs  of  the  UEI  to  assess nuclear mission areas. (T-1) AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 57 Chapter 4 THE UNIT EFFECTIVENESS INSPECTION (UEI).   4.1.  General Information.  The UEI integrates elements of compliance and readiness with new inspection  elements  to  create  a  new  IG  inspection  of  unit  effectiveness.    Conducted  by MAJCOM  IGs  and  AFIA  on  Wings  (as  defined  in  paragraph    2.2),  the  UEI  is  a  continual evaluation of performance throughout the inspection period—a “photo album” versus a snapshot. The  inspection  period  begins  immediately  after  the  close-out  of  the  previous  UEI  report.    The UEI  inspects  the  following  four  MGAs—Managing  Resources,  Leading  People,  Improving  the Unit and Executing the Mission—and the sub-MGAs detailed in Attachment 4.   4.2.  Purpose.  UEIs  validate  and  verify  a  Wing’s  CCIP  for  accuracy,  adequacy  and  relevance, and provide an independent assessment of the Wing’s resource management, leadership, process improvement  efforts  and  ability  to  execute  the  mission.    A  UEI  is  a  multi-year,  continual evaluation of the unit’s effectiveness, and is intended to help the Wing Commander understand the areas of greatest risk from undetected non-compliance.  4.3.  UEI  Schedule  of Events  (SOE).  Using a risk-based methodology; the MAJCOM IG will follow the UEI SOE in the conduct of a UEI (see Figure 4.1). The MAJCOM IG will ensure that a final report and grade will be provided to the Wing Commander and MAJCOM Commander. This  report  includes  2  grades:  one  grade  on  the  Wing’s  effectiveness  and  another  grade  on  the adequacy  of  resources  provided  to  the  Wing.    The  adequacy  grade  provides  a  MAJCOM Commander an assessment of the support the Wing is getting from HHQ staffs. Figure 4.1.  UEI SOE.    58 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 4.4.  Duties and Responsibilities. 4.4.1.  MAJCOM Commander: 4.4.1.1.  Implement and sustain the UEI in accordance with this instruction.  4.4.1.2.  Develop  a  MAJCOM  battle  rhythm  to  facilitate  UEI  risk-based  sampling strategy which enables continual evaluation of all Wings and gained Wings.  4.4.1.3.  Allow Wing Commanders the latitude to develop their own CCIP. 4.4.1.4.  Hold  Wing  Commanders  accountable  for  Commander’s  Inspection  Report (CCIR) accuracy. 4.4.2.  MAJCOM IGs: 4.4.2.1.  Continually  evaluate  unit  effectiveness  with  MAJCOM  Functional  Manager assistance. 4.4.2.1.1.  Build  a  tailored  risk  based  sample  strategy  for  each  wing  based  on  input from  SECAF,  CSAF,  TIG,  MAJCOM  Commander,  ANG,  NAF  Commander,  Wing Commander,  MAJCOM  Functional  Manager  (or  centralized  functional  activity  or FOA  as  appropriate),  this  instruction’s  Attachment  3,  self-assessment  data,  survey results, virtual inspections, and available IG resources to inform the UEI. 4.4.2.1.2.  Coordinate with respective Gatekeeper to schedule and synchronize all on-site visits conducted as part of the continual evaluation or Capstone event. 4.4.2.1.3.  GMAJCOMs  will  consolidate  UEI  Continual  Evaluation  data  for  ANG Wings (from GMAJCOM, ANG staff and FOA/DRUs), provide analysis and develop a risk-based sampling strategy based on GMAJCOM Commander guidance. 4.4.2.1.3.1.  The  majority  of  ANG  wings  are  multi-MAJCOM,  gained  by  one GMAJCOM  while  having  one  or  more  subordinate/supported  units  gained  by other  MAJCOMs.    The  GMAJCOM  for  a  multi-MAJCOM  ANG  wing  will lead/conduct  UEI  Continual  Evaluation  throughout  the  UEI  cycle  in  partnership IAW  established with  ANG  headquarters  and  other  MAJCOMs  and Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  between  MAJCOM/IGs  and in coordination with ANG/IG.  4.4.2.2.  Validate and verify the Wing CCIP.  4.4.3.  All MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/Centralized Activity Functional Managers: 4.4.3.1.  Participate  in  the  command’s  UEI  continual  evaluation  process  and  coordinate with the MAJCOM IG to identify areas of interest and/or emphasis items for the UEI by monitoring  data  from  each  Wing.    Use  tools  like  MICT,  trend  analysis,  and  any  other existing functional process in order to protect your equities at a minimum workload, and directly contribute to the IG’s risk-based sampling strategy.   4.4.3.2.  Recommend inspector augmentees with functional expertise to MAJCOM IGs.   AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 59 4.4.3.3.  For areas in which a MAJCOM HQ has limited expertise due to consolidation of subject-matter-experts, MAJCOM/Centralized Activity Functional Managers responsible for  oversight  for  that  MAJCOM  will  execute  the  UEI  continual  evaluation  process  and coordinate inspection augmentees to support the IG. 4.5.  UEI  Methodology.  The  following  guidance  will  be  used  to  assist  the  MAJCOM  IG  in developing sound inspection policy for conducting the UEI. 4.5.1.  Inspection Team.  The MAJCOM IG will assemble a team to perform the inspection and  submit  the  report  to  the  Wing  Commander,  NAF  Commander,  ANG  IG  (as  applicable for  ANG  units)  and  MAJCOM  Commander  upon  completion.    The  inspection  team  will consist  of  a  sufficient  number  of  assigned  IG  inspectors  and  augmentees  as  required  to conduct UEI inspections under the authority of the MAJCOM IG. 4.5.1.1.  When  non-IG  inspections  are  synchronized  by  the  MAJCOM  Gatekeeper,  the MAJCOM  IG  Team  Chief  will  coordinate  with  the  non-IG  inspection  Team  Leader  to minimize  any  adverse  effects  on  the  unit’s  mission  and  to  prevent  any  unnecessary duplication of effort or use of installation resources. 4.5.2.  Risk-based  sampling  strategy.    The  UEI  is  not  primarily  focused  on  detecting  non-compliance;  rather,  the  UEI  should  validate  and  verify  the  commander’s  own  compliance detection program, identifying areas for the Wing Commander where he/she has significant risk  of  undetected  non-compliance.    HAF  Functionals  identified  areas  in  Attachment  3 where  the  risk  from  undetected  non-compliance  is  greatest  for  a  Wing  Commander,  an Airman  or  the  Air  Force.    To  identify  areas  where  there  may  be  risk  of  undetected  non-compliance,  the  MAJCOM  IG  team  must  develop  a  risk-based  sampling  strategy  for  each Wing  that  inspects  areas  identified  in  Attachment  3  based  on  the  IG’s  assessment  of  the following:   4.5.2.1.  SECAF and CSAF areas of emphasis and Special Interest Items.  4.5.2.2.  MAJCOM commander’s intent, areas of emphasis and CIIs. 4.5.2.3.  TIG and MAJCOM IG direction or guidance. 4.5.2.4.  HAF  and  MAJCOM  Functional  Authority  areas  of  emphasis,  including mandatory items in Attachment 3. 4.5.2.5.  MICT and IGEMS data and other metrics. 4.5.2.6.  Wing Commander’s Inspection Reports. 4.5.2.7.  Available inspection reports from Attachment 2 approved events. 4.5.2.8.  Maturity and reliability of individual Wing CCIPs. 4.5.2.9.  Wing  commander-requested  emphasis  areas.    Wing  Commanders  may  request the  MAJCOM  IG  team  focus  on  certain  programs  or  units  for  further  validation  or verification. 4.5.2.10.  Inspection resource availability (e.g. TDY funds, inspectors). 4.5.2.11.  MAJCOM IGs should consider using the UEI Handbook to develop their Risk-Based Sampling Strategy. 60 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 4.5.3.  Frequency.    MAJCOM  IGs  will  establish  a  24-30  month  UEI  cycle  for  each  RegAF and  a  48-60  month  UEI  cycle  for  ANG  Wings.    AFRC  Wings  will  be  inspected  by  HQ AFRC  and  lead  MAJCOM  IGs  on  a  24-30  month  cycle.    MAJCOM  IGs  will  ensure  all elements of the UEI are completed within this timeframe (i.e., continual evaluation, survey, on-site Capstone inspection, and report) IAW this instruction.   4.5.3.1.  Respective  MAJCOM  inspection  responsibilities  and  lead  relationship  will  be documented in MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM Memorandums of Understanding or Reciprocity Agreement,  as  applicable,  between  HQ  AFRC  and  lead  MAJCOM  IGs,  to  be  approved no lower than the respective MAJCOM IGs. 4.5.3.2.  In addition to the Capstone visit, ANG Wings will receive at a minimum, an on-site  visit  from  the  GMAJCOM  IG  near  the  24-month  period.  The  GMAJCOM  IG  will ensure those inspection requirements that must be evaluated more frequently than 48-60 months are accomplished during this mid-point visit. However, MAJCOM IGs may elect to stage additional on-site visits in conjunction with ANG wing exercises, training events and actual mission performance. 4.5.3.3.  TFI Wings.  4.5.3.3.1.  MAJCOM IGs will coordinate with each other and the Wing Commanders of  Associate  Wings  to  determine  reasonable/practical  scope  and  scale  of  the  units’ participation in scheduled inspections. 4.5.3.3.2.  For TFI associations in which one or both units is graded INEFFECTIVE, the  MAJCOM  IGs  will  coordinate  with  each  other  and  both  Wing  Commanders  to determine re-inspection  timeline and scope. 4.5.3.4.  In  addition  to  the  Capstone  visit,  nuclear  capable  units  will  receive  at  a minimum, one nuclear focused OSV within the UEI cycle. Nuclear focused OSVs do not award NWTI/NSI credit.  It is an additional “snap-shot” in the UEI photo album.  4.5.3.4.1.  Any  validated  data  (deficiency,  RIA,  strength)  will  be  assessed  to  a relevant  UEI  MGA  and  documented  as  such;  however,  no  overall  unit  grade  (e.g. SAT/UNSAT)  is  required.    This  data  will  be  used  to  inform  the  UEI  risk  based sampling. 4.5.3.4.2.  In the event a MAJCOM/IG determines an unsatisfactory condition exists, as described in CJCSI 3263.05B, or surety is at risk, the Team Chief should notify the appropriate  levels  of  command  and  refer  to  AFI  13-503,  Nuclear-Capable  Unit Certification, Decertification and Restriction Program.  4.6.  Continual  Evaluation.  The  continual  evaluation  phase  of  the  UEI  begins  immediately after the Capstone visit is complete and the draft report is given to the Wg/CC. IGs should use all available Wing performance data to develop an overall assessment, including, but not limited to: Functional  Manager  input,  MICT  data,  self-assessment  data,  external  inspection  results  and Wing  CCIP  reports.  The  IG  may  discover  the  best  opportunity  to  inspect  the  Wing’s  ability  to execute  the  mission  occur  during  the  continual  evaluation  phase,  through  virtual  or  on-site inspections. These opportunities may be with notice, limited notice or no-notice, and include, but are  not  limited  to:  exercises,  training  events  and  actual  mission  performance.  The  information gathered is a part of the overall rating and grade. AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 61 4.6.1.  For  AFIS,  continual  evaluation  is  defined  in  the  continuous  feedback  provided  to process  owners  from  the  supervisor’s  chain  of  command,  wing  IGs,  functional  oversight agencies (such as MAJCOMs, FOAs, HAF/SAF FAMs, AF Installation and Mission Support Center,  etc)  and  MAJCOM  IGs  during  the  UEI  cycle.    Any  deficiency  or  non-compliance found  during  the  continual  evaluation  should  be  provided  to  the  process  owner,  chain  of command, and MAJCOM IG.  Continual evaluation activities may not always be inspections, but they all provide accurate and functionally-assessed data upon which IGs at all levels use to inform their risk-based sampling strategy and grading determination. 4.6.1.1.  Above  the  wing  level,  MAJCOM,  FOA,  NGB,  ANG  and  HAF  functional experts  monitor  unit  activities  through  reporting  via  functional  metrics,  reports,  MICT and  wing-level  and  MAJCOM  inspection  reports.    Any  deficiency  or  non-compliance found during the continual evaluation period should be provided directly to the unit-level process owner, the chain of command, and ultimately to the MAJCOM IG for inclusion in the wing's UEI "photo album" of performance. 4.6.1.2.  At  the  wing  level  and  below,  front  line  supervisors  and  commanders  ensure compliance  and  readiness.  (T-1)   They  validate  this  through  direct  supervisor involvement with activities and reporting via functional metrics, reports and MICT.  The Wing IG adds to this knowledge through exercise, inspection and documented inspection reports. (T-1) 4.6.2.  Virtual  Sampling.    Virtual  sampling  adds  a  critical  no-notice  element  to  the  UEI, particularly as it helps validate and verify a wing’s CCIP.  Wings should not be notified of virtual  sampling.    The  MAJCOM  IG  will  include  Attachment  3  areas  in  their  risk-based sampling  strategy  based  on  a  risk  assessment  considering  the  MAJCOM  Commander’s guidance and intent, criticality of the area, Wing performance and available MAJCOM staff resources.  4.6.3.  Wing  CCIR.    These  reports  should  inform  the  sample  strategy  of  the  MAJCOM  IG. Identified  deficiencies  in  a  Wing  Commander’s  CCIR  are  an  excellent  opportunity  for MAJCOM  IGs  to  sample  root  cause  analysis  and  commitment  to  continuous  improvement.  UEI  reports  and  grades  should  reflect  the  outcome  of  RCA  efforts  and  the  resolution  of issues identified in CCIRs.  4.7.  UEI survey. 4.7.1.  During  every  UEI  cycle,  MAJCOM  IGs  will  administer  a  survey  to  the  wing  to capture candid, confidential beliefs, attitudes and opinions about matters relevant to the four UEI  MGAs.    The  purpose  of  the  survey  is  threefold:  to  gather  data  since  the  last  on-site evaluation,  to  assist  in  determining  the  inspection  team  composition  and  to  inform  a  risk-based sampling strategy for the Capstone, on-site evaluation.  4.7.2.  MAJCOM IG personnel will distribute the survey link and instructions to all assigned Wing personnel approximately 90 days prior to the Capstone event (180 days prior for ARC Wings).  MAJCOM  IG  personnel  should  close  out  the  survey  on  a  date  that  provides  Wing personnel  ample  opportunity  to  complete  the  survey  while  also  allowing  MAJCOM  IG personnel ample time to analyze survey results before the Capstone event.  4.7.2.1.  Union  considerations.   Some  Collective  Bargaining  Agreements  include requirements to  coordinate surveys with  the union.   Requirements range from including 62 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 union  representatives  in  the  drafting  of  questions,  to  notifying  the  union  of  intent  to survey,  to  sharing  results  with  the  union.    Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  these requirements are in the collective bargaining agreement, the IG has no legal obligation to comply.  Under no circumstances, will MAJCOM IG teams share survey results with unit leadership or union leadership. 4.7.3.  Survey  results  assist  inspection  teams  understand  Airmen’s  attitudes,  beliefs  and perceptions and to more precisely target their sample strategy for the on-site Capstone visit.  MAJCOMs  will  use  the  SAF/IG-approved  survey  and  may  add  up  to  5  MAJCOM-unique questions. The survey results and analysis are intended for MAJCOM IG use only.   4.7.4.  Survey participants are assured that results are not shown to their chain of command, and  survey  administrators  will  honor  that  promise.    Under  no  circumstances  will  wing personnel, to include Wing commanders, receive copies of survey results. (T-0) 4.7.5.  IG complaints in the UEI survey.   4.7.5.1.  The  UEI  survey  is  not  intended  to  be  used  to  file  formal  IG  complaints.  However, all complaints, from any source (including anonymous), via any method, must be  handled  IAW  the  complaint  resolution  process  outlined  in  AFI  90-301,  Inspector General Complaints Resolution.   4.7.5.2.  AFIA will submit survey results to the MAJCOM Survey Monitor.  4.7.5.3.  MAJCOM IG members will screen UEI survey results for potential complaints.  Any  suspected  complaints  will  be  handed  off  to  properly-trained  complaints  resolution personnel and processed IAW AFI 90-301. 4.7.5.4.  MAJCOM  IG  complaints  resolution  personnel  will  determine  whether  the complaint is already being analyzed/resolved or under investigation via Automated Case Tracking System (ACTS) and/or contacting the Wing IG.   4.7.5.5.  Complaints  should  be  handed  off  to  the  Wing  IG  when  appropriate,  unless otherwise prohibited in AFI 90-301. 4.7.5.6.  Any  significant  trends  identified  during  this  process  should  shape  the  on-site risk-based sampling strategy for the UEI. 4.7.6.  During  the  out  brief  and  in  inspection  reports,  the  Team  Chief  may  elect  to  include validated  details  from  the  survey;  however,  these  must  be  reported  as  IG  validated strengths/discrepancies/RIAs/trends/benchmarks  without  associating  the  source  from  the survey.  Once validated, these may include: 4.7.6.1.  Feedback to the wing on select significant trends and proposed courses of action without compromising participant confidentiality. 4.7.6.2.  Comments about criminal behavior or immediate health/welfare concerns. 4.7.6.3.  If survey responses indicate an immediate health or welfare concern, MAJCOM IG  personnel  will  make  every  attempt  to  ascertain  the  identity  of  the  individual  from other  comment  blocks  (i.e.  voluntarily  divulging  name,  etc.).    If  the  identity  of  the individual can be determined, contact the commander or first sergeant for the individual and request a health and welfare check. AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 63 4.7.6.4.  Reports of criminal behavior will be handed over to appropriate law enforcement personnel, usually the regional Office of Special Investigations representative.   4.7.6.5.  If  survey  responses  include  allegations  of  sexual  assault,  treat  the  allegation  as an unrestricted report and comply with reporting requirements IAW AFI 90-6001, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program. 4.8.  On-site  Capstone  Visit.  The  Capstone  event  is  the  final  on-site  visit  of  the  UEI  and  the catalyst for generating a UEI report.  The Capstone event is intended to last approximately one week,  during  which  time  the  IG  will  validate  and  verify  the  CCIP,  conduct  Airmen-to-IG-Sessions,  and  independently  assess  unit  effectiveness  through  task  evaluations,  audits  and observation. 4.8.1.  Grade the Wing INEFFECTIVE if either: 4.8.1.1.  The  inspection  team  believes  CCIP  is  not  accurate,  adequate,  or  relevant.  (An accurate and trusted CCIP is the cornerstone of AFIS.)  4.8.1.2.  The  Wing  has  demonstrated  a  chronic  inability  to  execute  the  unit’s  primary mission. 4.8.2.  Airmen-to-IG-Session-Group  (ATIS-G).  An  ATIS-G  is  a  highly-structured  small group discussion (8-15 people), led by a MAJCOM IG facilitator specifically trained for this method. The ATIS-G is a standardized and regulated tool used by MAJCOM and AFIA for use  in  UEIs  and  MIs.  In  order  to  maintain  standardization  and  effectiveness,  wings  are discouraged from employing ATIS-Gs in CCIP.   4.8.2.1.  Protected  Communications.    Statements  made  during  ATIS-G  and  ATIS-I sessions  are  considered  protected  communications  (protected  disclosures  for  DoD Civilians) as defined in AFI 90-301 for all participants except spouses.  There is no legal provision  for  Air  Force  Inspectors  General  to  offer  protected  communication  protection to  spouses.    ARC  Technicians  will  be  in  a  military  status  to  participate  in  ATIS-G  and ATIS-I sessions. (T-0) 4.8.2.2.  ATIS-G  structure.    ATIS-G  sessions  will  be  conducted  by  all  MAJCOM  IG teams during every UEI cycle.  The SAF/IGI-approved script and structure will be used during each session.   4.8.2.3.  Participants. MAJCOM IG teams will randomly choose military, DoD Civilian, and  ANG  State  Employee  participants  for  ATIS-G  sessions.  MAJCOM  IG  teams  must coordinate  names  of  participants  with  inspected  units  to  deconflict  ATIS-G  attendance from  other  duties  or  scheduled  days  off.  ATIS-G  attendance  is  mandatory  duty  for military, DoD Civilians and ANG State Employees. (T-1) Active participation during the session is voluntary.  4.8.2.3.1.  Union  considerations.    Depending  on  the  content  of  local  Collective Bargaining  Agreements,  the  local  union  may  have  a  legal  right  to  have  a representative  in  each  ATIS-G  session.    This  applies  only  when  one  or  more participants in the ATIS-G session are subject to the bargaining agreement.  ATIS-G participants,  however,  are  not  entitled  to  individual  representatives  in  ATIS-G sessions.  MAJCOM IG teams will coordinate with the local civilian personnel office to determine if the union desires to have representatives in ATIS-G sessions.  Union 64 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 representatives  will  follow  the  same  administrative  and  conduct  rules  as  other participants, but will not participate in discussions.   4.8.2.3.2.  Spouse  considerations.    Air  Force  commanders  value  the  perspectives  of spouses.  MAJCOM IG teams will coordinate ATIS-G times for spouses.  Inspection teams  should  use  all  available  means  to  communicate  available  times  to  spouses, including,  but  not  limited  to:  Key  Spouse  networks,  Airman  and  Family  Readiness Centers, and social media.  Attendance and participation is voluntary for spouses. 4.8.2.4.  MAJCOM  IG  teams  will  capture  issues  identified  by  Airmen  during  ATIS-Gs for SECAF consideration and report in IGEMS.  Categorize issues by sub-MGA. 4.8.3.  Airmen-to-IG-Session-Individual  (ATIS-I).    An  ATIS-I  is  an  interview  between  an individual  unit  member  and  a  MAJCOM  IG  inspector.    ATIS-I  are  considered  protected communications as described in paragraph  4.8.2.1. 4.8.3.1.  ATIS-I structure.  ATIS-I sessions are used to  clarify information, fact-find, or corroborate other information.  There is no prescribed structure for an ATIS-I. 4.8.3.2.  Participants. MAJCOM IG teams may choose military, DoD Civilian and ANG State  Employee  participants  for  ATIS-I  sessions.  Prior  coordination  is  not  required,  but highly  encouraged  when  interviewing  unit  leadership.  ATIS-I  session  participation  is mandatory for military, DoD Civilians, and ANG State Employees. 4.8.3.2.1.  Union considerations.  Unlike ATIS-G events, there are no specific union considerations when conducting ATIS-I events.  The local union does not have a legal right to have a representative in any ATIS-I session.  Participants are also not entitled to individual representatives in ATIS-I sessions. 4.8.3.2.2.  Spouse considerations.  Participation is voluntary for spouses.   4.8.4.  On-site Audits, Evaluations, and Observations.  Wing performance should play a part in determining the scope and depth of the on-site IG visit based on assessment of continual evaluation,  risk  and  Commander’s  discretion.    Excellent  performance  throughout  the  UEI period may reduce the depth and scope of the  inspection sample.  Conversely, questionable performance may require a broader or deeper inspection.  MAJCOM IGs should consult with the  FAM  to  determine  requirement  for  an  on-site  audit  in  order  to  accomplish  self-assessment requirement driven by external policy and/or to effectively validate the results of the UEI virtual review. 4.8.5.  Inspection teams will have a handoff plan in place in the event a complainant, victim, or  whistle-blower  comes  forward  during  any  on-site  inspection.    All  inspectors  will  have contact information immediately available for appropriately-trained complaints resolution IG members,  law  enforcement,  SAPR  representative,  chaplain  or  other  helping  agency  as appropriate. (T-0) 4.9.  UEI Reports.  The UEI report covers the entire UEI period.  Once the MAJCOM IG report is  submitted,  the  Wing  immediately  enters  into  the  next  UEI  cycle.    The  UEI  report  will specifically include two distinct grades.  One grade is the wing grade, the other is the “adequacy of  resources”  grade.    The  adequacy  grade  provides  a  MAJCOM  Commander  an  assessment  of the support the wing is getting from HHQ staffs.  The report will not reveal any survey or ATIS-AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 65 G/I data disaggregated below the wing level.  Additionally, it will comply with inspection report guidance found in paragraph  2.18. 4.9.1.  UEI Scoring. 4.9.1.1.  Scoring.  To  standardize  UEI  ratings  across  the  Air  Force  and  to  enable  Air Force-level trending, all MAJCOM IG Teams will use a standardized numerical scoring methodology to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of processes related to each Major Graded  Area.  The  resulting  score  correlates  with  the  3-tier  ratings  listed  in  paragraph 4.9.4. 4.9.1.1.1.  MAJCOM  IG  teams  will  use  the  UEI  scoring  tool  provided  by  SAF/IGI until  such  time  as  a  scoring  capability  is  resident  in  IGEMS.    All  areas  must  be scored.    Submit  the  completed  UEI  scoring  tool  to  SAF/IGI  and  AFIA/ET  prior  to posting the final report in IGEMS. 4.9.1.1.2.  The  Team  Chief  may  adjust  the  final  rating  at  his  or  her  discretion, however  will  not  adjust  scores  to  match  final  3-tier  rating.  Scores  will  not  be disclosed  to  Wings,  but  will  be  aggregated  with  other  Wings’  scores  for  Air  Force-level trend analysis. 4.9.1.1.3.  Each sub-MGA will be scored by multiple inspectors (a minimum of three different  inspectors/inspection  augmentees)  using  all  available  data  gathered  during the entire UEI cycle. Only inspectors/inspection augmentees who have been trained in UEI scoring methodology should participate in UEI scoring. 4.9.2.  UEI Rating. 4.9.2.1.  MAJCOM IG Team Chiefs will assign ratings based on the 3-tier rating system found in paragraph 4.9.4. 4.9.2.2.  All MGAs and sub-MGAs must be assigned ratings.  4.9.2.3.  An INEFFECTIVE rating shall be handled as follows:  4.9.2.3.1.  Criticality  of  CCIP  Effectiveness.    If  the  MAJCOM  IG  rates  the  Wing’s CCIP  INEFFECTIVE,  regardless  of  performance  in  other  areas,  the  overall  UEI rating is INEFFECTIVE. 4.9.2.3.1.1.  Prior  to  1  Oct  2016,  the  MAJCOM  IG  inspects,  scores,  and  rates CCIP,  but  will  not  include  the  CCIP  score/rating  in  the  MGA  3  or  overall  UEI scores/ratings for a unit’s first UEI.  4.9.2.3.1.2.  For  subsequent  UEIs  (and  all  after  1  Oct  2016),  the  MAJCOM  IG will include the CCIP score/rating in the MGA 3 and overall UEI scores/ratings.  4.9.2.3.2.  Re-inspection for INEFFECTIVE CCIP.  The wing will receive a rigorous compliance-focused  on-site  IG  visit  to  validate  and  verify  (val/ver)  CCIP  within  90 days (180 days for ARC).  The highest possible rating for this 90-day (180 days for ARC) CCIP val/ver is EFFECTIVE.  4.9.2.3.2.1.  MAJCOM  Commander  approval  is  required  to  exceed  re-inspection timelines.   66 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 4.9.2.3.2.2.  If the Wing receives an INEFFECTIVE during the re-inspection, the Wing  begins  a  shortened,  1-year  (2-year  for  ARC)  UEI  cycle.  If  the  Wing receives  an  EFFECTIVE,  the  wing  returns  to  the  normal  UEI  cycle  (24-30 months, or 48-60 months as appropriate). 4.9.2.3.3.  Re-inspection  for  other  INEFFECTIVE  ratings.  If  a  Wing's  overall  rating is  INEFFECTIVE,  or  if  any  MGA  or  sub-MGA  other  than  CCIP  is  rated INEFFECTIVE,  schedule  an  on-site  IG  visit  within  6  months  (1  year  for  ARC). MAJCOM  Commander  approval  is  required  to  exceed  re-inspection  timelines.  The MAJCOM  IG  will determine whether to  re-inspect  all  areas, or focus on only  those with INEFFECTIVE ratings. 4.9.3.  Team  Chiefs  are  the  final  decision  authority  on  ratings  assigned  during  a  UEI. However, Team Chiefs will not adjust numerical scores to match ratings. Team Chiefs will consider  widespread  and/or  Critical  undetected  non-compliance/mission  failure/leadership failure when assigning a grade to the CCIP. 4.9.4.  The  3-tier  rating  system  is  based  on  the  Commander’s  Duties  and  Responsibilities section of AFI 1-2 and the following criteria. Execution of the rating system is outlined in the UEI Handbook.  4.9.4.1.  OUTSTANDING –This rating indicates the Wing meets/exceeds the criteria for an EFFECTIVE rating AND most or all of the following are consistently true:  4.9.4.1.1.  Mission activities, programs and processes are executed in an increasingly cost-effective manner.  4.9.4.1.2.  Results of long-term commitment to  continuous process  improvement are evident.  4.9.4.1.3.  CCIP is institutionalized, used to measure and report improvements in all 4 MGAs,  and  provide  actionable  feedback  to  HHQ  on  manpower,  funds,  equipment, facilities and guidance adequacy.   4.9.4.1.4.

MAJCOM/IG  teams  do  not  have  fully qualified experts assigned from every AFSC, which may necessitate augmentation from qualified Subject  Matter Experts (SME) assigned to  the FAMs from  throughout  the Air Force, including from centralized locations such as the Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center or FOA such  as  the  Air  Force  Civil  Engineering  Center.  Individual  ANG  members  are  allowed  to perform an Augmentation Inspector (AI) role in GMAJCOM funded Title-10 MPA status upon receipt of a validated request to ANG IG. AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 69 Chapter 5 THE COMMANDER’S INSPECTION PROGRAM (CCIP) 5.1.  General  Information.  A validated and trusted CCIP is the cornerstone of the AFIS.  The Wing IG is responsible to validate and verify self-assessment programs and independently assess the performance of organizations at and below the Wing level.  The CCIP should give the Wing Commander, subordinate commanders and wing Airmen the right information at the right time to assess  risk,  identify  areas  of  improvement,  determine  root  cause  and  precisely  focus  limited resources; all aligned with the commander’s priorities and on the commander’s timeline.  CCIP also  facilitates requests for targeted  assistance from  the MAJCOM Commander and staff when and where needed.  The CCIP will produce two key components:  the Self-Assessment Program and the Wing’s Inspection Program executed under the authority of the Wing IG to validate and verify  commander  self-assessments  are  accurate  and  timely,  and  independently  assess effectiveness  of  subordinate  units  and  programs.    These  components  provide  critical  data  to leadership about the adequacy of policy, training, manpower, funds, equipment, and facilities. 5.1.1.  Purpose.    The  purpose  of  CCIP  is  to  improve  readiness,  efficiency,  discipline, effectiveness, compliance, and surety in Air Force Wings while allowing Wing Commanders the  ability  to  assess  their  own  unique  mission  sets  in  reference  to  Designed  Operational Capabilities (DOC) statements, Mission Essential Task  List and Universal Joint  Task  Lists, mission  directives,  unit  type  code  (UTC)  and  other  authoritative  tasking  documents.    CCIP will identify a unit's ability to comply with policy and guidance issued from their MAJCOM or HAF.  Specifically, the directives that are wasteful and those that are valuable but resource limitations  prevent  compliance.    CCIP  will  help  the  Wing  commanders  reduce  the  risk  of undetected non-compliance. (T-1) 5.1.2.  Commander’s  Authority  to  Inspect.    IAW  10  USC  §  8583  and  AFI  1-2,  all commanders  appointed  by  G-series  orders  and  Civilian  Directors  of  Military  Organizations are  required  to  inspect  their  organizations.    Commanders  will  inspect  to  improve  unit performance,  readiness,  efficiency,  effectiveness  military  discipline  and  quality  of  life  for their Airmen. (T-0) 5.2.  CCIP  Requirements.  CCIP  is  mandatory  for  wings  defined  in  this  instruction  in paragraph 2.2. (T-1)  CCIP includes both a self-assessment component led by commanders and an  inspection  component  led  by  the  Wing  IG.  (T-1)    CCIP  will  inspect  wing-wide  and subordinate unit effectiveness, as well as assessing cross-unit programs as directed by the Wing Commander.  (T-1)    Commanders  will  determine  the  appropriate  scope,  scale,  timing  and methodology to most effectively accomplish the objectives of CCIP IAW this instruction.  (T-3) 5.2.1.  CCIP Key Components (see Figure 5.1). 5.2.1.1.  Self-assessment  program.    At  a  minimum,  commanders  will  utilize  MICT  to report compliance and communicate risk to the chain of command and appropriate staffs.  (T-1)  Augment with additional self-assessment programs and methods as necessary. 5.2.1.1.1.  Nuclear-capable  unit  Commanders  must  also  establish  a  self-assessment program to evaluate nuclear mission areas, as applicable. (T-1)  70 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 5.2.1.2.  Wing inspection program.  Executed by the Wing IG under the authority of the wing  commander.    The  purpose  is  to  validate  and  verify  subordinate  commander  self-assessments  to  ensure  they  are  accurate  and  timely.    The  Wing  IG  will  independently assess  effectiveness  of  subordinate  units  and  programs  and  will  utilize  IGEMS  to  plan, conduct and close-out inspections.   5.2.1.2.1.  Nuclear-capable  unit  Wing  IGs  must  also  independently  assess  nuclear mission area programs as they relate to the NSI MGAs and document validated data (deficiency, RIA, strength) to the UEI MGAs in IGEMS. (T-1)  5.2.1.3.  The  Commander’s  Inspection  Management  Board  (CIMB).  The  CIMB  will review CCIP deficiencies, root causes and CAPs, and upcoming CCIP events. (T-1) Figure 5.1.  Commander’s Inspection Program.  5.3.  CCIP  Methodology.  The  Wing  IG  will  execute  the  CCIP  on  behalf  of  the  Wing Commander.  (T-1)  This guidance is not meant to limit the commanders’ approach to effective management.  The Wing IG should be the principal advisor for inspections and a focal point for the WIT enable efficient reporting to the commander/director. 5.3.1.  The  CCIP  Manager  will  develop  an  annual  inspection  plan  approved  by  the  Wing Commander.  (T-3)    The  annual  inspection  plan  must  include  all  applicable  programs  in Table 5.1 and Table 5.2. (T-1) If agreements are made between host and tenant wings that result  in  one  wing  relying  on  another  wing  to  accomplish  the  requirements  in  Table  5.1 and/or  Table  5.2,  the  Wing  IG  will  capture  the  arrangement  in  an  MOA,  base  support agreement,  or  other  document.  (T-2)    Additional  inspections  should  focus  on  individual organizations,  programs  and  processes  considered  high-risk  or  of  particular  interest  to  the Wing Commander.  The annual plan should include at least one no-notice inspection. AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 71 5.3.1.1.  The  annual  inspection  plan  for  nuclear-capable  units  must  include  a  plan  to evaluate nuclear mission areas as they relate to the NSI MGAs. (T-1) 5.3.2.  The  CCIP  Manager  will  develop  a  risk-based  sampling  strategy  to  accompany  the annual inspection plan.  The strategy should be focused on those areas important to the Wing Commander.    It  should  include  products  and  sources  of  information  for  use  as  objective indicators  of  unit  or  program  performance.    Integrating  and  analyzing  multiple  sources enables  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  unit  effectiveness  and  efficiency.  (T-1)    These sources include, but are not limited to: 5.3.2.1.  Status  reports/Status  of  Resources  and  Training  System  (SORTS)/  AEF  UTC Reporting Tool (ART)/ Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS). 5.3.2.2.  Wing Quality Assurance (QA) programs. 5.3.2.3.  Wing Standardization/Evaluation. 5.3.2.4.  Wing Safety assessment and inspection results. 5.3.2.5.  Other self-assessment program results. 5.3.2.6.  Wing IG reports. 5.3.2.7.  Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) Wing reports. 5.3.2.8.  Personnel Reliability Assurance Program (PRAP) status meeting minutes. 5.3.2.9.  Personal observations. 5.3.2.10.  Climate surveys. 5.3.3.  Inspection  methods.    Wing  IG  may  use  any  and  all  legal  and  appropriate  inspection methods  available.    However,  Wing  IGs  will  refrain  from  conducting  exact  copies  of MAJCOM  ATIS-G  and  UEI  Surveys.    MAJCOM  and  AFIA  IG  teams  must  use  these  Air Force-wide inspection methods, and any replication by Wing IG teams will only reduce their effectiveness in the long term. (T-1) 5.3.4.  CCIP ratings. CCIP will assess and report using the same four MGAs and sub-MGAs as the UEI.  (T-1) See Attachment 4 for a listing of all MGAs and sub-MGAs. Wing IGs are encouraged to use the five-tier rating system found in paragraph 4.9.4.  5.4.  Self-Assessment  Program  Guidelines.  Commanders  are  responsible  for  unit  self-assessment, not IGs.  Led by unit commanders, IAW 10 USC § 8583 /G-Series orders, and AFI 1-2,  Commanders  Responsibilities,  self-assessment  provides  commanders  with  a  means  for internal assessment of a Wing’s overall health and complements external assessments.   5.4.1.  Self-Assessment  programs  should  include  a  wide  variety  of  internal  assessments  or evaluations.    At  a  minimum,  commanders  must  utilize  applicable  Self-Assessment Communicators  (SACs)  in  MICT.  (T-1)    However,  because  SACs  only  communicate  the highest risk areas, Commanders are encouraged to include additional measures as directed by superior Commanders, functional directives, or proven lessons and experience. 5.4.2.  Commanders  will  ensure  all  applicable  HAF  and  MAJCOM  SACs  are  assessed  by appropriate members. (T-1) 72 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 5.4.2.1.  New  or  updated  SACs  are  produced  quarterly  (Jan  1,  Apr  1,  Jul  1,  Oct  1).  Commanders have 30 days (2 UTA cycles for ARC) to assess new or updated SACs. (T-1) SACs are used by commanders and policy makers to make real-time decisions.  5.4.2.2.  Commanders  will  appoint  a  Self-Assessment  Program  Manager  at  the  Wing, Group and Squadron level. (T-3)   5.4.2.3.  Each  program  manager  will  utilize  MICT  to  record  self-assessments.    Each program  manager will identify individual assessors for each SAC based on the types of questions  asked  in  the  SAC.  (T-3)  Program  managers  will  not  delegate  wing-level questions to individual assessors. (T-2) 5.4.2.4.  Wings  will  use  Deficiency  Cause  Codes  listed  in  Attachment  7  when conducting observation resolution within MICT. (T-1) 5.4.3.  Wing-authored SACs. SACs for local supplements may be created but must follow the hierarchy and naming conventions found in  Chapter 2.  Specifically, they may not  contain any higher-echelon guidance found in AFIs or MAJCOM supplements.  (T-1)   5.4.4.  Wing-authored  Local  Checklists.  These  checklists  are  fundamentally  different  from SACs  and  are  not  constrained  by  SAC  policies  found  in  Chapter  2.  Their  use  is  optional. Refer to paragraph  2.17.2.4 for additional guidance on their use.  5.5.  Inspection  Guidelines.  The  following  guidance  will  be  used  to  help  Wing  commanders and  their  Wing  IG  develop  a  sound  inspection  plan.    This  guidance  is  purposefully  broad  to allow  commanders  to  shape  their  inspection  programs  to  meet  their  needs  and  resource constraints. 5.5.1.  Commanders  will  determine  the  amount  of  notice  given  for  inspections,  in  line  with the  intent  to  evaluate  daily  effectiveness  while  reducing  the  wasteful  practice  of  inspection preparation. (T-3) 5.5.2.  Wing IGs will consolidate inspections to avoid redundancy, and eliminate inspections which  are  not  mission-essential  and  whose  benefits  do  not  outweigh  their  costs.    Do  not inspect non mission-essential items/areas that detract from mission readiness and waste time and initiative. (T-3) 5.5.3.  SAC  validation.  SAC  responses  are  assumed  to  be  truthful  and  timely.  Periodically though, Wing IGs will validate or audit assessments for accuracy and timeliness. (T-1)  This audit normally involves physically confirming responses with the assessor.   5.5.4.  Vertical  Inspections.    Unit  inspections  are  commonly  referred  to  as  vertical inspections since they typically stay within command lanes. Vertical inspections are usually conducted at the squadron or group level.  5.5.5.  Horizontal  Inspections.  Program  inspections  are  commonly  referred  to  as  horizontal inspections  since  they  cut  across  units  and  command  lanes  throughout  the  Wing.  Programs evaluated  during  horizontal  inspections  will  be  evaluated  to  AFI  standard,  By-Law requirement, or other  governing policy. At a minimum, Wing  IGs must inspect  all By-Law programs contained in Table 5.1  A MOU/MOA or other equivalent written documentation  (e.g.  email  between  two  commanders)  must  be  established  (and  signed  between  respective parties) to identify specific inspection responsibilities by wing/wing equivalents. (T-0) Wing AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 73 IGs  will  refer  to  the  SAF/IGI  Portal  page  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  most  current information for Table 5.1. (T-0) 5.5.5.1.  Tenant  wings  are  responsible  to  inspect  ALL  By-Law  programs  to  the  highest level  which they  are  responsible  unless  a  MOA/MOU  or  equivalent  written documentation is established. (T-0) 5.5.5.2.  All By-Law validated data will be input into the By-Law section of IGEMS for each By-Law separately. (T-1) The comments box in IGEMS will annotate which MGA, and  if  appropriate  which  sub-MGA  applies.  (T-1)  For  Host  units  the  comments  must include  any  Tenant  units  that  are  covered  by  MOU/MOA.  (T-1)  For  Tenant  units  who have  an  established  MOU/MOA  with  a  host  unit  the  comments  section  must  at  a minimum reference the MOA/MOU for each respective By-law. (T-1)  Functional Areas must  appropriately  be  assigned  to  By-Law  validated  data,  and  will  not  state  “By-Law Program.” (T-1) 5.5.6.  The Wing Commander will determine the closure authority for deficiencies for Wing IG  identified  deficiencies.  (T-1)  Deficiencies  levied  against  higher  headquarters  will  be handled IAW paragraph 2.19.6. (T-1) 5.5.6.1.  The Wing Commander will ensure deficiencies are closed when CAPs are fully implemented and validated. (T-1) 5.5.7.  Nuclear-capable  units  should  conduct  inspections  that  assess  nuclear  mission  area program compliance and proficiency in accordance with the NSI MGAs.  Any validated data (deficiency,  RIA,  strength)  will  be  assessed  to  the  UEI  MGAs  and  documented  as  such however; no overall unit grade (e.g. SAT/UNSAT) is required. 5.5.7.1.  In  the  event  a  WG/CC  determines  an  unsatisfactory  condition  exists,  as described  in  CJCSI  3263.05B,  or  surety  is  at  risk,  the  WG/CC  should  notify  the appropriate  levels  of  command  and  refer  to  AFI  13-503,  Nuclear-Capable  Unit Certification, Decertification and Restriction Program.   5.6.  Commander’s Inspection Management Board (CIMB). 5.6.1.  The  intent  of  the  CIMB  is  to  synthesize  CCIP  data  and  results.    Wing  IGs  should attempt  to migrate the discussion from historical, descriptive performance data to predictive data, with the goal to  graduate the dialogue to prescriptive data.  In other words, instead of focusing  on  historical  performance  (“here’s  what  we  did”),  the  CIMB  should  evolve  to prescribing  what  actions  the  wing  should  take  (“here’s  what  we  should  do”)  in  order  to improve  performance  in  all  four  MGAs  towards  the  Wing  Commander’s  vision  and priorities. 5.6.2.  The  Wing  CIMB  will  meet  monthly  (quarterly  for  ARC).  (T-3)    The  focus  of  the CIMB is to reduce risk of undetected non-compliance, to manage the risk from known areas of  non-compliance,  and  to  ensure  the  wing  inspection  plan  meets  the  commander’s requirements.   5.6.3.  CIMB should consider the status of key open inspection items, to include progress and updates  on  CAPs,  estimated  close-out  date,  mitigating  circumstances,  recommendations  for closure  (if  warranted)  and  external  assistance  required  in  order  to  posture  the  Wing Commander  for  prescriptive  actions  to  improve  the  wing.    Group  Commanders  brief  their 74 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 CCIP  status  to  include  deficiencies,  CAPs  and  issues  affecting  upcoming  scheduled MAJCOM inspections and any requested SAVs.  (T-3) 5.6.4.  Preparations for the CIMB include pulling applicable observation reports from MICT,  IGEMS open deficiencies, identifying trends and deficiencies requiring external coordination (Joint-Base support, functional coordination, FAM, etc.).  A review of internal and external inspections  captured  utilizing  a  risk-based  sampling  strategy  and  commander’s  intent  will provide background for and guide the discussion. 5.6.5.  Required attendees at the CIMB.  The board is chaired by the Wing Commander (or the Vice-Wing Commander if the Wing Commander is not available).  Group Commanders, Wing staff agency chiefs, and Squadron Commanders will attend. (T-3) 5.6.6.  Problem-solving  responsibility  and  the  corrective  action  process  reside  at  the  lowest appropriate command level, not with the IG’s staff.   5.6.7.  CIMB Brief.  The CIMB will include the following: (T-3) 5.6.7.1.  CCIP dashboard (tailored report of the key metrics the Wing Commander values and questions, deficiencies/severity, and/or observations/trends). prescriptive synthesized review, inspection data, SAC 5.6.7.2.  Key open deficiency review. 5.6.7.3.  Self-assessment  observations review (break out  by unit, top  5 observations and concerns). 5.6.7.4.  Upcoming events (UEI on-sites, inspection calendar, and gatekeeper events). 5.6.7.5.  Group Commander Objectives and Feedback. 5.6.7.6.  Wing Commander Objectives and Feedback. 5.6.7.7.  All By-Law programs, their FY inspection status, based on the annual inspection plan, and all open By-Law deficiencies. 5.7.  Commander’s  Inspection  Report  (CCIR).  Though  a  continual  process,  the  CCIP culminates  annually  with  the  publishing  of  the  Wing  Commander’s  CCIR.    This  is  the  Wing Commander's  assessment  of  the  wing's  readiness  and  compliance,  written  in  the  framework  of the four MGAs and sent to the their MAJCOM Commander (gaining MAJCOM Commander for ANG wings). (T-1)  5.7.1.  Frequency.  Wing Commanders will ensure reports are sent within 90 days (180 days for ARC, and annually thereafter) of taking command, at the one year point in command, but not later than the anniversary of the first report, and after 2 years of assuming command, not later than the anniversary of the second report. (T-1)  5.7.2.  Content.  At a minimum, the CCIR will include the Wing Commander’s assessment of the four MGAs over the reporting period using the CCIR template at Attachment 10.  (T-2) CCIRs should normally not exceed two pages total.  5.7.3.  Routing. Wing Commanders will send their CCIR to the MAJCOM Commander IAW Figure 5.2 or as directed in the MAJCOM Supplement.  (T-2)  MAJCOM IGs will receive a courtesy copy of the CCIR as shown in Attachment 10. (T-1) AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 75 5.7.3.1.  ANG Wing commanders will forward their CCIR through their state staff to the State  Adjutant  General,  and  to  ANG/IG.    ANG/IG  will  forward  the  CCIR  to  ANGRC Commander and Director, ANG and applicable GMAJCOM IG.  (T-1) 5.7.3.2.  Wing Commanders will publish CCIRs in  IGEMS  or  IGEMS-C,  as applicable, within 30 days after transmitting the report. (T-1) 5.7.3.3.  Field  Operating  Agencies  and  Direct  Reporting  Units  will  submit  CCIRs  to HAF/SAF parent organizations and input into IGEMS. Figure 5.2.  CCIR Routing (T-2).  5.8.  Wing  Inspection  Team  (WIT).  The  WIT  consists  of  SMEs  who  augment  Wing  IG  to conduct  CCIP inspections under the  authority  of  the Wing Commander.  WIT members  are not assigned to the IG office; rather WIT augment the IG team as an additional duty. Specific duties include  providing  inputs  for  scenario  development,  inspecting  assigned  areas/functions, validating  self-assessment,  evaluating  scenarios,  participating  in  the  hot  wash  and  providing inputs to the inspection report.  5.8.1.  IG  duty  is  a  position  of  high  public  trust.  Personnel  selected  to  be  WIT  members should  possess  attributes  of  the  highest  professional  standards  and  moral  character.  In addition to these qualities, the WIT member should demonstrate adherence to the Air Force core values, be able to maintain a security clearance commensurate with the duties required and  present  good  military  bearing  and  appearance.  WIT  members  are  not  required  to  meet eligibility requirements in Chapter 9.  5.8.2.  There is no rank or experience requirement for WIT members.    76 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 5.8.3.  The  Wing  IG  will  develop  and  oversee  Wing-specific  training  to  ensure  all  WIT members  are  properly  trained  as  inspection  augmentees  and  sworn-in  by  oath.  (T-1)    This will be documented and filed IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule  in AFRIMS and IGEMS as appropriate. (T-1)  5.8.3.1.  The  Wing  IG  will  ensure  Wing  IG  instructors  develop  and  teach  all  Wing-specific training for Wing inspectors and inspection augmentees. (T-1)  5.8.3.2.  DELETED 5.8.3.3.  DELETED  5.8.3.4.  DELETED  5.8.3.5.  DELETED 5.8.4.  WIT members may be in a position to receive protected communication.  In the event this occurs, the WIT member will inform the Airman the disclosure meets the requirement as a protected communication. (T-1) The WIT member will then report the full conversation to an IG trained complaints resolution and has access to ACTS. (T-1) 5.9.  Roles and Responsibilities. 5.9.1.  Wing Commander will: 5.9.1.1.  Establish, execute and sustain a Wing CCIP. (T-0) 5.9.1.2.  Designate the Wing IG as the CCIP Manager. (T-1) 5.9.1.3.  Identify and apportion manpower to administer an effective CCIP. (T-1) 5.9.1.4.  Establish  and  staff  a  Wing  IG  office  to  accomplish  the  duties  outlined  in paragraph  5.9.2.    (T-1)    Follow  guidance  in  Chapter  9  regarding  personnel  selection and  appointment.  (T-2)    Consider  using  the  office  manning  templates  located  in Attachment 5. 5.9.1.5.  Provide  appropriate  training/training  opportunities  to  military  and  civilian personnel to obtain the technical or administrative expertise in order to assist with CCIP requirements.

(T-1) AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 81 Chapter 6 AIR FORCE NUCLEAR INSPECTION PROGRAMS 6.1.  Nuclear  Weapons  Technical  Inspections  (NWTI).  Nuclear  weapon  systems  require special consideration because of their political and military importance, their destructive power, and the potential consequences of a nuclear weapon incident. NWTIs are an integral part of the AFIS  and  are  considered  a  snapshot  within  a  wing’s  UEI  cycle.  Additionally,  NWTIs  are performance and compliance-based inspections and are conducted to evaluate a unit’s ability to manage nuclear resources while complying  with  all nuclear surety standards (reference  DODD 3150.02, DoD Nuclear Weapons Surety Program). CJCSI 3263.05B is the governing instruction for  the  conduct  of  NWTIs.  In  instances  where  CJCSI  3263.05B  specifies  responsibilities  for “Service,”  MAJCOMs  fill  that  role.  The  Nuclear  Surety  Inspection  (NSI)  is  the  Air  Force inspection  used  to  satisfy  requirements  of  an  NWTI.  Air  Force  inspection  teams  will  conduct NSIs in accordance with CJCSI 3263.05B and reference this instruction for additional Air Force-specific  inspection  requirements.  If  there  is  conflict  between  CJCSI  3263.05B  and  this instruction, CJCSI 3263.05B takes precedence. (T-0) See paragraph 1.5.9.6 and Attachment 3 for NWRM inspection guidance. 6.2.  Nuclear  Surety  Inspector  Eligibility,  Training  and  Certification.  In  addition  to  the requirements  of  CJSCI  3263.05B  and  Chapter  9,  to  fulfill  inspection  data  collection,  MAJCOM/IGs will provide training and certification status, IG experience level and number of NSIs conducted to AFIA for tracking and trending.  6.3.  Nuclear-Capable Unit Operational Certification and Operational Restriction.  Refer to AFI  63-125,  Nuclear  Certification  Program  and  AFI  13-503,  Nuclear-Capable  Unit Certification, Decertification and Restriction Program. 6.4.  Initial  Nuclear  Surety  Inspection  (INSI).  The  INSI  is  the  culminating  step  both  in  the Operational  Certification  Process  for  certifying  a  unit  as  nuclear-capable  as  well  as  certifying new equipment and/or systems  requiring nuclear certification.  The MAJCOM, in  coordination with HQ AFSEC/SEW, will determine the need for conducting an INSI based upon AFI 63-125 and AFI 13-503 requirements. MAJCOMS will assign a READY or NOT READY rating based on inspection criteria developed by applicable functional(s). In order to meet Oversight and Core Team  responsibilities,  MAJCOM  IGs  will  notify  AFIA/NI  at  least  60  calendar  days  prior  to inspection  execution  (refer  to  paragraph  6.14.2 and    8.2).    MAJCOM  IGs  will  notify  Nuclear Enterprise agencies of the inspection conclusion using Attachment 6. 6.4.1.  For  units  not  nuclear-certified,  conduct  an  INSI  prior  to  employing,  storing, assembling,  maintaining  or  transporting  War  Reserve  (WR).  Conduct  an  NSI  within  180 calendar days of the unit receiving an INSI READY rating.  Unless waived by the MAJCOM Commander,  the  READY  rating  expires  180  calendar  days  after  the  unit  receives  the READY rating. 6.4.2.  For  currently  certified  nuclear-capable  units  programmed  to  receive  a  new  weapon system/delivery system, conduct an INSI of operations and maintenance supporting the new system  prior  to  receipt.    Conduct  an  NSI  within 180  calendar  days  of  the  unit  receiving  an INSI  READY  rating.    Unless  waived  by  the  MAJCOM  Commander,  the  READY  rating expires 180 calendar days after the unit receives the READY rating. 82 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 6.4.3.  INSIs  may  be  conducted  in  phases.    If  phased  INSIs  are  conducted,  the  responsible MAJCOM  will  prepare  an  inspection  plan  identifying  all  required  areas  to  be  inspected  by phase and forward the plan to HQ AFSEC/SEW for review and approval.  A READY rating must  be  achieved  and  maintained  for  the  phase  of  the  INSI  under  evaluation  before evaluating  the  next  phase.    All  phases  must  be  rated  READY  prior  to  assuming  nuclear operations.  Unless waived by the MAJCOM Commander, a phased READY rating expires 180  calendar  days  from  issuance.    Conduct  a  NSI,  on  all  portions  of  the  unit’s  nuclear mission,  to  include  the  addition  of  all  phases,  within  180  calendar  days  of  final  INSI completion. 6.5.  Nuclear  Surety  Inspection  (NSI).  An  NSI  assesses  a  unit’s  ability  to  accomplish  its assigned  nuclear  weapons  mission  and  produce  reliable  nuclear  weapons  in  a  safe  and  secure environment  in  compliance  with  applicable  directives.  Additionally,  an  NSI  inspects  a  unit’s capability to safely and reliably receive, store, secure, assemble, transport, maintain, load, mate, lock/unlock,  test,  render  safe  and  employ  nuclear  weapons.    Missile  launch  crews,  aircrews, command  post  controllers  and  release  teams  must  demonstrate  (through  performance-based assessments,  testing,  etc.)  their  knowledge  of  weapon  acceptance  procedures,  nuclear  weapon system  safety  rules,  and  nuclear  weapon  control  order  handling  and  authentication  procedures.  MAJCOMs  will  assign  overall  unit  ratings  and  MGA  adjectival  ratings  as  specified  in  CJCSI 3263.05B for NWTIs. In order to meet Oversight and Core Team responsibilities, MAJCOM IGs will  notify  the  AFIA/NI  at  least  60  calendar  days  prior  to  inspection  execution  (refer  to paragraph  6.14.2  and    8.3).  MAJCOM  IGs  will  notify  Nuclear  Enterprise  agencies  of  the inspection conclusion using Attachment 6. 6.5.1.  Frequency  of  NSIs.    NSIs  will  be  scheduled  IAW  CJCSI  3263.05  Enclosure  D.  Waivers  beyond  the  24-month  certification  cycle  will  be  submitted  by  the  MAJCOM Commander to agencies required by CJCSI 3263.05B.  Waiver requests will include the new NSI  date.    In  addition,  the  MAJCOM  Commander  will  provide  informational  copies  to  the CSAF and recipients listed in Table A6.2, Group 1.  6.5.2.  Sequencing with  other inspections.  MAJCOMs may conduct NSIs sequentially with other inspections. 6.6.  Re-inspection 6.6.1.  When the unit receives an overall UNSATISFACTORY rating, the deficient areas that caused or contributed to the overall UNSATISFACTORY rating must be re-inspected using one of the following methods, as determined by the Team Chief: 6.6.1.1.  Re-inspect  prior  to  termination.    The  team  chief  may  conduct  an  “on-the-spot” re-inspection  prior  to  terminating  the  inspection.    If  the  on-the-spot  re-inspection indicates the deficiency is non-systemic and is sufficiently corrected to permit operations, a follow-up inspection is not required.   6.6.1.1.1.  The  adjectival  rating  for  the  “on-the-spot”  re-inspected  area(s)  will  not exceed  ACCEPTABLE.    If  all  deficient  areas  are  successfully  re-inspected,  the overall unit rating will be UNSATISFACTORY (Re-inspected to SATISFACTORY). 6.6.1.1.2.  Do  not  re-inspect  prior  to  termination  if  the  Team  Chief  determines  “on-the-spot” re-inspection is inappropriate, or if:  AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 83 6.6.1.1.2.1.  The  failure  is  due  to  a  systemic  problem  or  a  general  lack  of proficiency within the unit.  6.6.1.1.2.2.  Suspension  of  nuclear  weapon  operations  is  in  the  best  interest  of nuclear safety, security, or reliability.  6.6.1.2.  Re-inspect  after  termination.    In  instances  where  re-inspection  prior  to termination  is  not  appropriate  as  determined  by  the  Team  Chief  or  re-inspected  area(s) are not sufficiently corrected, the MAJCOM IG will schedule an Re-inspection NLT 90 days from termination of the NSI. 6.6.1.2.1.  Re-inspection  rating.    If  all  deficient  areas  are  successfully  re-inspected, the  overall  unit  rating  for  this  Re-inspection  will  be  RE-INSPECTED  TO SATISFACTORY.  Assigning MGA adjectival ratings will be at the discretion of the MAJCOM.    Unless  an  MGA  was  inspected  to  the  same  level/depth  of  a  full-scale NSI,  adjectival  ratings  should  be  limited  to  ACCEPTABLE,  MARGINAL  or UNACCEPTABLE.    Document  re-inspection  results  IAW  Attachment  6  and forward to Table A6.2, Group 1 addressees. 6.7.  Reporting  Criteria.  For  INSIs,  NSIs,  site-visits  and  re-inspections,  reports  will  only identify  Benchmarks, Strengths,  Deficiencies, and RIAs.  MAJCOM  IGs  will ensure that RIAs are  not  used  to  document  procedural  deviations  or  non-compliance;  they  should  be  used  to recommend a more efficient or effective course of action (see paragraph  2.19). 6.7.1.  Non-surety deficiencies.  Document non-surety deficiencies in the non-surety section of  the  NSI  report.    In  general,  deficiencies  are  categorized  as  non-surety  if  the  deficiency's referenced  policy  is  neither  a  primary  nuclear  policy  document,  a  supplement  to  a  primary nuclear  policy  document  or  referenced  within  a  primary  nuclear  policy  document.    For example,  a  deficiency  against  the  Wing  IG  for  failing  to  comply  with  AFI  90-201,  would typically be considered a non-surety deficiency.  However, a deficiency against AFMAN 31-108  or  a  MAJCOM  Supp  to  AFMAN  31-108  would  typically  be  considered  surety  related and categorized in the Security MGA.  The IG Team Chief will make the final determination of whether a deficiency is surety or non-surety. 6.8.  NSI Inspector Surety Tenets. inspected. 6.8.1.  Inspectors  will  use  applicable  instructions,  technical  orders  (T.O.),  etc.  as  the inspection  standard  for  the  documentation,  operation,  process,  and  procedure  observed  or otherwise   Absent  direct  observation,  authoritative  documentation  (e.g., maintenance logs) takes precedent.  The IG Team Chief bases conclusions on facts collected through  direct  observation  (e.g.,  commission  or  omission  of  an  act  during  a  technical operation)  or  authoritative  documents.  Inspectors  may  consider  testimonial  inputs,  but assertions  usually  do  not  carry  the  same  weight  as  direct  observation  or  documentary evidence. 6.8.2.  No  NSI  compliance  credit  is  given  after  inspector  intervention.    Inspectors  will intervene  to  ensure  safety,  security,  and  reliability  of  WR.    When  inspector  intervention drives  eventual  unit  compliance,  the  inspected  unit  does  not  earn  credit  for  compliance  for the purposes of the NSI. 84 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 6.8.3.  When determining the impact severity of missed tests/inspections, the IG Team Chief will  consult  with  SMEs  to  determine  the  reliability  impact  of  a  specific  omitted/improper test/inspection. 6.8.4.  IGs cannot postulate that a follow-on test(s) and inspection(s) will be accomplished or identify  possible  malfunction.    IG  recognizes  there  are  follow-on  tests  and  inspections  that have a very high probability of detecting possible malfunctions that went undetected by the omitted  test  and  inspection.    However,  designed-in  redundancy  must  be  weighed  against CJSCI 3263.05, C-3.c.  Regardless if all follow-on tests and inspections are accomplished as required,  IGs  should  not  postulate  the  inevitability  that  such  future  tests  and  inspections would  identify  any  malfunctions  induced  by  defects  that  the  omitted  test  and  inspection  is designed to uncover. 6.9.  DoD NWTI MGAs.  This Instruction does not replicate the information contained in CJCSI 3263.05B.  The criteria below add Air Force-specific inspection specifications and requirements to existing DoD criteria:  6.9.1.  Management and Administration.  6.9.1.1.  Management.    Evaluate  leadership,  guidance,  communication,  and  attitude  of unit  commander  and  key  supervisors.    When  assessing  management,  consider  whether deficiencies  are  the  result  of  individual  error  or  reflect  management  or  supervisory training/experience gaps.  6.9.1.2.  Administration.   6.9.1.2.1.  Evaluate  weapons standardization, certification, training programs and schedules.  loading  and  management to include loading 6.9.1.2.2.  Evaluate  re-entry  system  mating  management  to  include  standardization, training and certification programs and maintenance plans, as required. 6.9.1.2.3.  Evaluate  status  of  approved  security  or  safety  waivers,  exemptions, deviations and exceptions. 6.9.1.2.4.  Munitions  Control.   Evaluate  Munitions  Control  in  the  planning, coordinating, directing and controlling munitions/weapons activities IAW applicable AFIs.  6.9.1.2.5.  Munitions/maintenance  plans  and  scheduling.    Evaluate  IAW  applicable Air Force publications. the  certification  processes  and  documentation  of  unit 6.9.1.2.6.  Evaluate certified/qualified  personnel  (e.g.,  maintainers,  aircrew,  missile  combat  crew members, vehicle operators, etc) assigned to duties involving nuclear weapons.   6.9.1.2.7.  Munitions  Accountable  Systems  Officer  and  Nuclear  Reporting  Section.  Evaluate  all  aspects  of  the  daily  accountability,  reporting  and  custody  of  the  unit’s nuclear  weapons,  components,  spares  (base  and  military)  and  Combat  Ammunition System  managed  Nuclear  Weapon  Related  material  IAW  applicable  Air  Force Publications.   AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 85 6.9.2.  Technical Operations. 6.9.2.1.  Evaluate each type of assigned weapon(s) or weapon system(s) units are tasked to  support  to  assess  safety,  security,  reliability  and  technical  performance.    These evaluations are limited to those operations on which personnel maintain certification and operations  directed  by  CJCSI  3263.05B.    All  record  actions  and  reporting  normally associated with the operation will be evaluated. MAJCOM IGs will determine the scope and  definitive  start/stop  of  technical  operations.    In  order  to  minimize  the  inspection footprint  and  mirror  day-to-day  unit  operations,  this  inspection  activity  evaluates  unit certified  teams  performing  NWTI-required  technical  operations  with  minimal  QA  and other unit leadership presence.   6.9.2.2.  Table 5.2. Air Force Installation Mission Assurance Exercise Requirements.  For all  technical  operations  and/or  task  evaluations  the  MAJCOM  IGs  will  brief  items  in paragraphs 6.9.2.2.3.1. thru 6.9.2.2.3.7. to all personnel to be evaluated prior to the start of  the  evaluation.  Units  may  be  required  to  submit  team  assignment  documents,  duty rosters,  unit  committed  munitions  lists,  maintenance  capability  letters,  etc.,  to  the MAJCOM IG before team arrival to expedite team selection. Consider individual Career Field Education Training Plans, Training Business Area, Load Training and Certification Document (AF IMT Forms 2435), PRP status, and work shifts and ARC personnel when making team selections (maintain team integrity to the maximum extent possible). 6.9.2.2.1.  Unit  assessors,  QA,  and  weapons  standardization  are  also  subject  to evaluation.  The MAJCOM IG may task these personnel to perform an evaluation of a maintenance operation within their area of responsibility.  MAJCOM IGs will clearly identify technical operations and/or task evaluations that require QA participation and evaluation of the QA function.   6.9.2.2.2.  During  evaluation  of  any  nuclear-certified  procedure,  the  MAJCOM inspectors are to inspect the performance of only those individuals/teams required by the  applicable  T.O.  or  guiding  instruction  for  the  procedure.    Intervention, participation  or  influence  by  any  other  personnel  (e.g.,  QA,  Unit  Weapons  Officer, unit leadership, etc.) may  be cause to  terminate the procedure if, in  the judgment of the  Inspector,  the  outside  assistance  calls  into  question  the  technical  proficiency  or knowledge  of  the  individual/team  under  evaluation.    The  environment  in  which technical  operations  are  conducted  demonstrates technical  proficiency  and standardization of the unit training program. When technical operations are conducted using  training  weapons,  units  may  simulate  some  aspects  of  security,  entry  control, approved  explosive  loading  site  plans,  and/or  other  operations  that  cannot  be reasonably conducted. 6.9.2.2.3.  As a minimum, the MAJCOM IG task in-brief will include:  6.9.2.2.3.1.  Inspectors  will  stop  an  operation  or  task  only  after  all  reasonable opportunities  to  detect  the  deficient  condition  have  passed  or  if  conditions  are detected  that  would  jeopardize  personnel  or  weapon  safety,  security,  weapon system reliability, and/or cause equipment damage. 6.9.2.2.3.2.  All  personnel  who  perform  in  process  inspections  (IPIs),  or  provide technical help IAW AFI 21-series guidance will be included in all evaluations. 86 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 6.9.2.2.3.3.  If  required,  QA  or  unit  supervisors  may  observe  the  operation; however, inputs will be limited to preventing actual safety, security or reliability errors. 6.9.2.2.3.4.  If  an  abnormal  situation  presents  itself  and  it  is  not  covered  in technical  data,  consult  with  your  supervision.    The  MAJCOM  IG  will  expect  a full assessment of the nature of the problem and what actions are taken to correct or report the problem. 6.9.2.2.3.5.  MAJCOM IGs may review all paperwork generated as a result of the technical operation or task evaluations. 6.9.2.2.3.6.  MAJCOM  IGs  will  approve  all  simulations  and  deviations  prior  to the start of the technical operation or task to include all previously complied with steps. 6.9.2.2.3.7.  MAJCOM IGs are not on PRP, therefore, inspectors cannot be a part of  a  TWO-PERSON  team.    Inspectors  will  not  intentionally  violate  the  TWO-PERSON concept. 6.9.2.3.  Weapons  maintenance  technical  operations.    Evaluate  applicable  technical operations  designated  in  CJCSI  3263.05B,  for  which  the  unit  is  tasked  in  their Maintenance  Capability  Letters  and  Unit  Committed  Munitions  Lists.    For  comparable operations evaluate only one weapon system type. Certain operations listed individually may be combined for the purpose of inspection.  Inspectors will approve the starting and stopping configuration before the operation.   6.9.2.4.  Loading  and  Mating.  MAJCOM  IGs  will  evaluate  a  unit’s  ability  to  conduct  a complete  weapons  upload  and  post-load  procedures  assessing  technical  proficiency  and standardization.  Additionally,  MAJCOM  CCs  may  direct  evaluation  of  download procedures. Loading operations must encompass each type and upload position (internal and external), as weapon system applicable. When loading operations are conducted in a load training facility, use simulations as appropriate. 6.9.2.4.1.  For  custodial  units  supporting  non-US  delivery  organizations,  include  the US technical load monitor and associated training activities. 6.9.2.4.2.  DELETED 6.9.3.  Tools, Test, Tiedown and Handling Equipment. 6.9.3.1.  Air Force registered motor vehicles and vehicular equipment.  Evaluate vehicle management  control,  accountability  and  maintenance  practices  for  ensuring  nuclear-certified  vehicles  and  vehicular  equipment  are  maintained  in  a  safe  and  serviceable condition.    Evaluate  vehicle  operator/using  organization’s  ability  to  perform  applicable operator’s  maintenance  and  documentation  requirements  on  nuclear-certified  vehicles and vehicular equipment to ensure safe and serviceable condition.   6.9.3.2.  Equipment.    Evaluate  unit  equipment  management  to  ensure  only  nuclear certified software, testers/cables and equipment is used in support of the nuclear mission. Evaluate  equipment  is  being  maintained  in  a  serviceable  condition,  current  equipment calibration  dates  and  equipment  limitations/restrictions  are  adhered  to.    Document  any AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 87 supply issues which impact the ability to obtain replacement parts, tools, and equipment required to operate, maintain, and sustain the nuclear weapon systems. 6.9.4.  Condition of the stockpile.  6.9.4.1.  Sample  size.    Examine  at  least  25%  of  the  active/inactive  coded  assets  and associated  bolsters,  containers,  components,  and  records  in  igloo  storage,  in  long  term storage  facilities  and/or  weapon  storage  vaults  to  ensure  they  are  stored  in  accordance with weapons-specific T.O.s.  MAJCOM IG teams will select resources to be inspected.  6.9.4.2.  Retirement assets.  Examine at  least  10% of weapons coded for retirement  and associated  records  to  ensure  safe  and  secure  storage  in  accordance  with  applicable explosive,  nuclear  safety  and  nuclear  security  criteria,  weapons-specific  T.O.s  and retirement  unit  requirements  contained  in  T.O.  11N-35-51,  General  Instructions Applicable to Nuclear Weapons.. 6.9.4.3.  Ensure weapons are stored in a safe and reliable configuration and in accordance with  applicable  directives.  (i.e.,  properly  grounded,  chocked,  immobilized.)    Ensure weapons have proper spacing, storage compatibility, and are within explosive and active material limits.  If defects are discovered on weapons, components or equipment during stockpile  walkthroughs,  ensure  evaluation  against  applicable  technical  publication, technical  order,  or  instruction  and  ensure  appropriate  corrective  actions  are  taken  and documented.    Ensure  the  weapons  inspection  record  card  information  matches  the asset/container  markings  (P/N,  Drop  Numbers,  S/N,  ALTs,  etc)  for  all  weapons; active/inactive and retired inspected. 6.9.4.4.  For  assets  with  storage  bags,  sample  a  number  of  bags  to  ensure  all  required items  are  located  in  the  storage  bag  and  properly  packaged  and  or  sealed.    Ensure  the weapons inspection record card information matches the asset/container  markings (P/N, Drop Numbers, S/N, ALTs, etc.) for all weapons; active, inactive and retired inspected. 6.9.5.  Storage and maintenance facilities. 6.9.5.1.  Evaluate  roads  in  storage  areas,  between  storage  and  loading  or  missile  launch areas.   6.9.5.2.  Evaluate nuclear-certified hoists to ensure, at a minimum, hoists are serviceable, authorized, and have received mandatory load testing and/or safety related inspections.  6.9.6.  Security.   6.9.6.1.  Evaluate  unit  compliance  with  DOD  S-5210.41M_  AFMAN  31-108  and  other required  security  standards  for  protecting  WR  weapons  and  weapon  systems.    Security inspection  sub-areas  and  inspection  methodology  are  depicted  in  Attachment  6,  Table A6.1.    Performance-based  criteria,  where  designated,  is  the  primary  means  of  the inspection.    Compliance  with  existing  requirements  is  assessed  through  a  risk-based sampling  strategy,  and  where  practical,  in  conjunction  with  exercise  events  and/or  task evaluations.  Compliance with established requirements is considered when determining the overall security area rating.   6.9.6.2.  MAJCOMs  will  supplement  this  section  to  ensure  their  specific  operating environments and elements of the published Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Nuclear 88 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 Security  Threat  Capabilities  Assessment  (NSTCA,  2005-2015)  are  addressed  while ensuring safe exercise conditions to meet exercise objectives. 6.9.6.3.  Weapon denial and recapture exercise planning: 6.9.6.3.1.  MAJCOM IGs, working with their staff functional counterparts and AFIA, will develop realistic nuclear weapon security exercise scenarios to determine a unit’s ability to meet the Nuclear Weapons Security Standards (NWSS).  The MAJCOM IG team will determine the exercise scenario and coordinate scenario with DTRA during DNSIO planning. 6.9.6.3.2.  Risk  Management  and  safety  procedures  will  be  used  in  planning  and execution  of  security  exercises  at  all  levels  of  command.    When  exercises  are collocated  within  operational  areas,  care  will  be  exercised  to  avoid  scenarios  that could be interpreted as an actual hostile situation that might cause accidental injury or illness to personnel or jeopardize the security of nuclear resources.    6.9.6.3.3.  At  IG  discretion,  exercise  scenarios  resulting  in  the  opposing  force (OPFOR) gaining access to simulated nuclear weapons may automatically trigger the recapture or recovery exercise, as applicable.  Inspectors will ensure both the OPFOR and exercise controllers know the “adversary intentions” for the planned attack (e.g., sabotage weapon, destruction, theft, etc.).  6.9.6.3.4.  All  participants  will  apply  appropriate  Information  Security  (INFOSEC) and  Operations  Security  (OPSEC)  measures  to  safeguard  exercise  information, tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  (TTP).    Likewise,  the  results  of  NSIs  security exercises, or other like inspections under the auspices of the IG, will be appropriately classified,  rated,  critiqued,  and  reported  for  cross-tell  purposes  within  the  nuclear community.  6.9.6.3.5.  OPFOR  Planning.    Exercise  scenarios  will  portray  an  OPFOR  that replicates  adversaries  identified  in  the  published  DIA  NSTCA.    Likewise,  OPFOR capabilities  will  be  matched  as  best  as  possible  IAW  this  document  to  evaluate  the unit’s integrated effort to meet the NWSS.  Ensure distinct separation of exercise play area from real world mission areas using visual identification tools (safety vest/belts, exercise  controllers),  safety  briefings  for  trusted  agents  and  normal  exercise Command  and  Control  (C2)  communication  announcements.    All  OPFOR,  exercise controllers,  and  IG  trusted  agents  will  be  under  the  operational  direction  of  the inspecting IG.  6.9.6.4.  Evaluate  EOD  integration  into  Weapon  Recapture  and  Recovery  planning  to ensure  checklists,  equipment,  and  training  supports  unit  concept  of  operations  in instituting CJCSI 3261.01C, (U) Recapture And Recovery Of Nuclear Weapons and PPD 25 procedures, as applicable.  6.9.6.5.  Evaluate weapon denial and recapture exercises IAW CJCSI 3263.05B.  6.9.6.5.1.  Determine the effect (outcome) of executed security action(s) and response (performance),  in  conjunction  with  the  impact  of  unit  compliance  with  technical criteria  and  contribution  of  support  forces  and  supporting  security  systems,  as applicable, (see Attachment 6, Table A6.1) to determine if the NWSS was met.  AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 89 6.9.6.5.2.  Modeling and simulation.  As available and applicable, the inspector may use  computer  modeling,  simulation,  etc.  as  a  viable  measuring  tool  for  developing response force scenarios based on the published DIA NSTCA. 6.9.7.

Conduct  a  limited  spot-check inspection of the Intrinsic Radiation Safety Program to ensure controls are in place and personnel practice as low as reasonably achievable concepts when practical.  6.9.8.  Supply  support.      Document  any  supply  issues  which  impact  the  ability  to  obtain replacement parts, tools, and equipment required to operate, maintain, and sustain the nuclear weapon systems. 6.9.9.  Nuclear  Weapon  Personnel  Reliability  Assurance  Program  (PRAP).    The  PRAP includes  both  Personnel  Reliability  Program  (PRP)  and  Arming  Use  of  Force  (AUOF). Evaluate PRAP as applicable IAW DoDI 5210.42, CJCSI 3263.05, AFMAN 13-501 and AFI 31-117.  Assess the overall effectiveness of the unit’s implementation of PRAP by focusing on processes and procedures through observation, scenarios, and interviews. 6.9.9.1.  PRAP processes, not records reviews, will be the primary focus.  Records review will  only  be  accomplished  as  part  of  scenario  based  performance  objectives  or  to investigate a potential finding/discrepancy during the process/procedural review. 6.9.9.2.  Inspectors  will  assess  the  certification,  continuing  evaluation,  removal  from PRAP  duties,  return  to  duty,  training  and  management  processes  using  scenario-based exercises,  formal  and  informal  interviews,  and  observing  day-to-day  operations  to validate/verify processes employed by the unit/installation. 6.9.9.3.  Program inspection will validate/verify PRAP is functioning as a Commander’s program  in  assuring only  those personnel  who have demonstrated the highest  degree of individual reliability for allegiance, trustworthiness, conduct, behavior, and responsibility are allowed to perform duties associated with nuclear weapons. 6.9.10.  Logistics  Movement.    Evaluate  all  units  supporting  or  having  responsibility  for logistics  movement  of  nuclear  weapons  by  observing  weapon  breakout,  transfer/transport, loading,  unloading,  and  custody  transfer  procedures  of  representative  types  of  weapons. Receipt/verification  and  preparation  for  shipment  technical  operations  may  be  evaluated  in conjunction with the logistics movement if it benefits the unit.  The team should conduct the inspection  (other  than  an  INSI)  during  missions  involving  WR  weapons  when  available. Evaluate: 90 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 6.9.10.1.  Convoy  operations.

Purpose.  This chapter provides general guidance for conducting inspections at a Joint Base (JB)  where  the  Air  Force  is  either  the  supporting  or  the  supported  Component.    MAJCOM supplements  to  this  publication  will  include  MAJCOM-specific  guidance  for  JB  inspections within their command.   7.2.  Definitions. 7.2.1.  The  “Supporting  Component”  is  the  component  is  responsible  for  providing installation support for the JB and geographically separated locations that transferred via the MOA.  functions transferred to them from one or more supported components.  For JBs with the Air Force serving as the lead service, all RegAF and Reserve Air Force units on the JB are considered part of the Supporting Component. 7.2.2.  The “Supported Component” is a component identified in BRAC 2005 as transferring installation  support  functions  to  another  component  at  a  JB.    For  JBs  with  the  Air  Force serving as the lead service, all Active and Reserve Army, Navy, Marine Corps and other non-Air Force DoD units on the JB are considered Supported Components.  On non-Air Force led JBs,  all  Air  Force  units  residing  on  the  installation  are  considered  part  of  the  Supported Component, Active or Reserve. 7.2.3.  A  “Tenant”  is  defined  as  all  DoD  agencies/activities,  ANG  units  and  all  non-DoD entities  on  a  JB.    Working  Capital  Fund  units  not  performing  installation  management functions are also classified as tenants. 7.2.4.  “Installation  Support”  is  any  of  the  twelve  categories  of  services  and  support activities.    These  are  identified  in  the  Cost  Performance  Visibility  Framework  (CPVF) quarterly.  JBs are resourced to provide installation support to the DoD developed Joint Base Common  Output  Level  Standards  (JB-COLS)  performance  standards.    Examples  include Command  Support,  Community  Services,  Emergency  Management,  Environmental, Facilities  Investment,  Facilities  Operations,  Housing,  Human  Resources  Management, Information  Technology  Services  Management,  Logistics  Services,  Operational  Mission Services and Security Services. 7.2.5.  JB-COLS  are  output  or  performance  level  standards  established  by  the  DoD  for installation support using a  common framework  of definitions, outputs, output performance metrics,  and  cost  drivers  for  each  installation  support  function.  These  standards  provide  a description  of  the  capability  associated  with  the  particular  installation  support  function.  These  output  levels  apply  to  all  DoD  Components,  including  DoD  tenants,  at  JBs.  A  JB, through the Joint Management Oversight Structure (JMOS), can request a deviation from the output  level.    Only  a  senior-level  DoD  function,  the  Installations  Capabilities  Council,  is authorized to approve deviations from JB-COLS. 7.2.6.  Joint  Base  Implementation  Guidance  (JBIG).  The  BRAC  2005  Joint  Basing recommendations implements recommendations  in  a  way  that  expeditiously  achieves  the  optimal  level  of  long-term savings, while preserving or enhancing DoD’s warfighting capabilities.  The JBIG, to include require  detailed  guidance to ensure that  DoD 94 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 all  supplemental  guidance,  directs  DoD  Components  to  implement  joint  basing  under  a common framework. (T-1) It establishes the JMOS and confirms that all installation support is transferred to the supporting Component to take full advantage of the efficiencies available from consolidation.  Realizing the unique nature of our installations, the guidance establishes a  governing  framework  to  justify  and  approve  variances  to  the  guidance,  ensures  all Component  equities  are  represented,  and  expeditiously  resolves  challenges the fundamental improvement in the management of infrastructure resources. to 7.2.7.  Memorandum of Agreements, in terms of the JBIG, is the binding document for each JB that describes the organization structure, resourcing, output levels, dispute resolution and other  agreements  developed  between  the  Components.    The  JB  Implementation  Plan  is included in the MOA.  The MOA, signed by the Component Vice-Chiefs of Staff, defines the relationships  between  Components,  and  commits  the  supporting  Component  to  delivery  of the approved output levels. 7.2.8.  All IGs must be aware that other support agreements are possible at the local level and fall under the following categories: (T-2) 7.2.8.1.  Intra-Service agreements are Air Force to Air Force, to include AFRC and ANG.   7.2.8.2.  Inter-service are Air Force to other DoD Components. 7.2.8.3.  Intra-governmental  agreements  are  Air  Force  to  other  non-DoD  Federal activities. 7.2.8.4.  Agreements  supporting  Air  Force  to  other  non-Federal  activities,  excluding private or commercial enterprises.   7.2.9.  The  Supporting  Component  ensures  compliance  with  JBIG  and  MOA  requirements.  However, if a Supported Component is not satisfied with the installation support operations, either  for  personnel  or  equipment,  the  Supported  Component  may  elect  to  improve resourcing to meet their particular mission needs at their own expense and after coordination with Supporting Component for bed-down support requirements. (T-3) 7.3.  Command Relationships. 7.3.1.  Base organization and Installation Support (IS). 7.3.1.1.  A standing JMOS ensures fairness for the JB process by providing oversight of MOA compliance, dispute resolution, and equitable allocation of funding requirements to the  responsible  entities.    The  JMOS  then  serves  as  a  decision  chain  for  JB-specific performance leaders  and organizations at every echelon.  A JB Partnership Council is the foundation of the JMOS with the following key roles:  Review semi-annual CPVF reports prior to submission to Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  (OSD)  and  Service  HQs  and  resolve  IS  delivery issues.  It does not replicate routine JB decision processes or management functions.  installation  management issues,  and includes  service 7.3.1.2.  Air  Base  Wing  (ABW)/Group  or  Air  Force  Element  responsibilities  are organize,  train  and  equip  functions,  and  apply  to  Airmen  assigned  to  JBs.    Organize responsibilities  include    Command  Authorities  IAW  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice (UCMJ),  DRRS,  SORTS,  ART,  IMR  Management,  Backfill  Management,  and  Military Personnel  Management  (Performance  Reports/Decorations  and  Functional/Quarterly Awards).  Training responsibilities include Expeditionary/Readiness  Training and Force AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 95 Development  (Training,  Education).    Equip  responsibilities  include  Deployment/DOC Statement Equipment and Readiness Training Equipment.  7.3.1.3.  The  JB  commander  (JBC)  has  the  authority  and  responsibility  for  effectively using  available  resources  for  planning,  organizing,  directing,  coordinating,  and controlling  the  delivery  of  installation  support  as  detailed  in  the  MOA.    The  JBC  is synonymous  with  the  Air  Force  term  “installation  commander,”  and  the  JBC  exercises the  authority  traditionally  associated  with  the  installation  commander  on  non-JB  Air Force  installations.    Consequently,  the  JBC  is  the  commander  who  has  authority  and control over JB real property and is responsible for directing installation management and support functions IAW the MOA and the established JB-COLS requirement.  7.3.1.3.1.  There may be instances in which the JBC’s authority and the authority of other commanders on the installation are concurrent.  All supporting component and supported commanders retain the inherent authority to provide for the health, morale and welfare of their assigned personnel and for the good order and discipline of their units.    Commanders  also  retain  UCMJ  authority  and  administrative  control  over military personnel under their command (assigned Component), regardless of whether the military personnel are being operationally directed by the JBC.  However, unlike other commanders on the installation, the  authority of the JBC extends to  the entire installation by virtue of  his  or her position as the installation commander.  A list  of authorities  and  responsibilities  assumed  by  the  JBC  are  set  out  in  the  MOA  and  in paragraph 4.1.4. of the DoD Supplemental Guidance for Implementing and Operating a Joint Base (as indicated, the list is illustrative and not exhaustive). 7.3.1.4.  Business  Office  (BO).    BOs  are  part  of  some  JB  developmental  solutions.    As such, the  BO consolidates responsibilities for agreement management,  such as an  Inter-Service  Support  Agreement.    The  BO  does  not  have  responsibility  for  any  roles customarily  assigned  to  a  traditional  Air  Force  Mission  Support  Groups  or  Weapon Storage Areas, but is the action office (or supporting office) for “other duties as assigned” that  may  include  demographic  data  gathering,  significant  event  calendar  management, Economic Impact Assessment, and the Joint Land Use Study.   7.4.  Inspections. 7.4.1.  Air  Force  IGs  will  inspect  Airmen  using  Air  Force  inspection  requirements  whether the  Air  Force  is  the  supporting  or  supported  service  at  the  JB.    (T-1)  When  an  Air  Force supporting unit is providing service to an Air Force supported unit, the inspection standards stem from Air Force guidance. When an Air Force supporting unit is providing service to a supported unit from another service (Army, Navy, etc.), the inspection standards stem from JB-COLs. (T-1) 7.4.1.1.  CCIP.  Air Force commanders on a JB will administer their CCIP in accordance with Chapter 5 of this instruction.  (T-1) 7.4.1.2.  JB Wing IGs will ensure MAJCOM Gatekeepers are kept apprised of Navy and Army inspection activities on the installation. (T-2)  Wing IGs will also ensure Navy and Army  leadership  at  the  JB  are  kept  apprised  of  Air  Force  inspection  activities  at  the installation.  (T-3) 96 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 7.4.2.  Each JB has installation variances based on size, location, mission, etc., which make each  inspection  unique.    Additionally,  MOAs  between  services,  organizations,  and  entities are  fluid,  complicating  the  IG’s  inspection  planning  efforts.    In  order  to  execute  the  most effective JB inspections across the spectrum of functional disciplines, a thorough inspection planning  process  is  required.    ARC  units  located  at  JBs  will  be  notified  of  regularly scheduled inspections with a minimum one year notice. (T-2) 7.4.3.  At  JB  locations  where  the  Air  Force  is  the  supporting  component,  the  Emergency Management  (EM)  program  will  be  inspected  IAW  Table  5.2  of  this  instruction.  At  JB locations  where  another  Service  is  the  supporting  component,  the  owning  MAJCOM  will develop  specific  criteria  for  the  lead  RegAF  unit  IAW  the  unit’s  role  (if  any)  in  the installation EM program. 7.4.4.  Inspection  Rating.    Fundamentally,  the  Air  Force  portion  of  the  inspection  remains unchanged—the  IG  will  inspect  any  Airman,  Air  Force  process,  program  or  function.    The IG will inspect and rate each distinct unit IAW the IG’s risk-based sampling strategy. (T-2)  For example, at JB Lewis-McChord, the 627th Air Base Group will receive a rating and the 62d Airlift Wing will receive a separate and distinct rating.  At JB McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL),  the  87th  Air  Base  Wing  will  receive  a  unique  rating,  as  will  the  305th  Air Mobility Wing, and the 621st Contingency Response Wing. 7.4.5.  IGs  will  ensure  that  any  non-Air  Force  issues  uncovered  during  the  inspection  that affect  Air  Force  unit  compliance  are  addressed  in  the  report  and  passed  to  SAF/IGI  for resolution.  SAF/IGI will work with the other Service IG(s) and the Intermediate Command Summit  to  resolve  the  issue.    The  final  Air  Force  report  may  provide  a  comprehensive assessment on how the other Service’s installation support impacts the Air Force mission, but it will not deliver a rating to the other Services. 7.4.6.  IGs  will  comply  with  guidance  contained  in  the  JBIG  and  any  MOAs  affecting  the inspected unit.  When conflict between supporting and supported Services at the JB arise that cannot  be  resolved  locally,  the  MAJCOM  IG  will  notify  SAF/IGI,  who  then  attempts  to resolve the matter with Service counterparts. (T-2) 7.4.7.  When the Air Force is the supporting component at a JB, the Wing IG will ensure the supported  component  leadership  is  invited  to  participate  in  all  appropriate  local  exercises (e.g.,  active  shooter,  natural  disaster,  etc.).  (T-2)    When  the  Air  Force  is  the  supported component, the Wing IG will ensure participation IAW Air Force JB leadership intent. (T-3)  7.5.  Responsibilities. 7.5.1.  SAF/IGI.  Deficiencies that negatively impact Air Force processes, equipment and/or personnel,  but  are  not  “owned”  by  the  Air  Force  through  delegation  of  installation  support leadership, are the responsibility of SAF/IGI for resolution once up-channeled by AFIA and the MAJCOM IG Team Chief in the IG report. 7.5.2.  AFIA.    Invite  appropriate  non-Air  Force  inspectors  to  the  annual  Gatekeeper scheduling conference.  This maximizes calendar efficiencies for the JBs and provide a more positive, interactive and authoritative inspection. 7.5.2.1.  Coordinate with other Service IGs to establish a joint inspection schedule.   AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 97 7.5.3.  MAJCOM IG Team Chief.   7.5.3.1.  The Team Chief is responsible for final approval of the JB inspection plan. 7.5.3.2.  For  deficiencies  that  negatively  impact  Air  Force  processes,  equipment  and/or personnel, but are not “owned” by the Air Force, the Air Force IG Team Chief annotates the issue(s) in the Air Force inspection report.  Additionally, the Team Chief will debrief the  issue(s)  to  senior  Air  Force  leadership  at  the  inspected  unit,  as  well  as  the  senior supporting component leadership at  the inspected installation.  (T-2)  The MAJCOM IG Team  Chief  will  then  forward  the  issue  requiring  resolution  to  AFIA  (this  process  is similar to a write-up against another HHQ).  AFIA will work with SAF/IGI to resolve the issue. (T-1) 98 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 Chapter 8 THE AIR FORCE INSPECTION AGENCY (AFIA) PROGRAM ELEMENTS 8.1.  AFIA  provides  independent  inspection,  evaluation,  and  analysis  to  advance  the continuous  improvement  of  mission  effectiveness  at  all  Air  Force  levels.  Its  mission  set includes:  NSIs,  Inspection  Oversight,  Directed  Inspections  (DIs),  MIs  and  UEIs.  Additionally, when directed, AFIA evaluates and reports on high-impact, high-visibility  programs that are of significant interest to SECAF, CSAF, or SAF/IG.  AFIA provides medical inspectors to support UEIs Air Force-wide, as required. 8.2.  Air Force Inspection Oversight 8.2.1.  AFIA  Oversight  and  Evaluation  Team  (AFIA/OV).    AFIA/OV  conducts  oversight assessments to provide independent validation and verification of Air Force inspections and promote  standardization  across  the  enterprise.    They  provide  feedback  to  SAF/IG  and MAJCOM  Commanders  on  the  efficiency,  effectiveness  and  consistency  of  MAJCOM  IG teams  conducting  inspections  of  all  types  (i.e.  NSIs,  UEIs,  MIs,  etc.)    Feedback  is  derived from  over-the-shoulder  observation  of  inspection  planning  (when  able)  and  execution, focusing  on  the  quality,  standardization,  objectivity,  thoroughness  and  conduct  of  the MAJCOM IG team. 8.2.1.1.  AFIA/OV  will  selectively  determine  which  non-nuclear  inspections  to  oversee with the goal of providing each MAJCOM IG feedback across the spectrum of inspection activity over  a 24-month period.  (T-1) AFIA/OV will  provide oversight  or observers  at all MAJCOM-conducted NSIs and select INSIs and nuclear-focused OSVs, to include all re-inspections. (T-1) The AFIA/CC will be the final authority on the selection of nuclear-focused OSVs and INSIs. (T-1)  Oversight assessments may be conducted with minimal or no-notice. 8.2.1.2.  AFIA  will  coordinate  each  visit  with  the  respective  MAJCOM  IG  Gatekeeper and will honor the IG trusted agent system to protect the minimum or no-notice aspect of the inspection.  8.2.1.3.  The Oversight team will maintain a minimal footprint and be as nonintrusive to the  MAJCOM  or  wing  inspection  as  possible.    Oversight  inspectors  are  authorized  to intervene in an inspection for reasons of safety, security, or critical non-compliance if the MAJCOM IGs fail to take appropriate actions to correct the situation.  Additionally, with respect  to  nuclear  surety,  AFIA/OV  inspectors  will  intervene  if  the  safety,  security,  or reliability of a weapon is in jeopardy.  8.2.1.4.  MAJCOM  IG  will  provide  AFIA/OV  access  to  current  inspection  SOEs, IGEMS/IGEMS-C,  MICT  for  the  inspected  unit,  qualification/training  and  composition of  MAJCOM  IG  team  to  include  augmentees,  and  any  deliverables  requested  from  the inspected  unit.  AFIA/OV  will  request  this  access  once  they  inform  MAJCOM  IGs  of their intention to conduct an oversight assessment.  8.2.1.5.  The  Oversight  Team  Chief  will  brief  the  MAJCOM  IG  Team  Chief  on AFIA/OV’s  role  in  the  inspection  process  and  ensure  the  unit  leadership  is  briefed accordingly. AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 99 8.2.1.6.  During  the  course  of  the  inspection,  MAJCOM  IGs  will  allow  AFIA/OV inspectors  to  be  present  for  all  in-briefs  and  out-briefs  (including  executive  sessions), daily  IG  meetings,  deficiency  validation  sessions  with  the  inspected  unit,  and  any discussions/validations  with  MAJCOM  FAMs  or  SMEs.    Oversight  inspectors  will  be afforded access  to  all inspection events  to include ATIS-I/G interviews and all exercise areas  and  technical  operations  where  authorized  by  EAL.    MAJCOM  IG  Team  Chiefs will  immediately  notify  the  Oversight  Team  Chief  of  any  potential  CRITICAL deficiencies. 8.2.1.7.  The  MAJCOM  IG  Team  Chief  will  provide  the  AFIA/OV  Team  Chief  a  draft copy of the NSI report prior to the unit out-brief. 8.2.1.8.  Upon  inspection  conclusion,  the  AFIA/OV  Team  Chief  will  provide  a  separate non-collaborative  report,  routed  through  AFIA  Commander  and  TIG  to  SECAF  (NSIs only), MAJCOM Commander and MAJCOM IG within 30 days from the MAJCOM IG final  report  release.  (T-1)  Final  oversight  reports  will  be  filed  in  IGEMS.  (T-1)  The oversight  report provides an assessment of the  MAJCOM IG team  and  their conduct  of the inspection. Specific areas to be addressed in each report include: 8.2.1.8.1.  Concurrence  or  non-concurrence  with assessment. the  MAJCOM IG  overall 8.2.1.8.2.  An independent perspective of the unit’s nuclear surety (NSIs only). 8.2.1.8.3.  An independent perspective of the unit's CCIP (UEIs only) 8.2.1.8.4.  Contentious  issues  (for  NSIs  include  areas  requiring  level  1  or  2 adjudication IAW paragraph  6.15). 8.2.1.8.5.  Composition of the qualification and training of MAJCOM inspection team to include augmentees. 8.2.1.8.6.  Implementation and understanding of policy and guidance.  8.2.1.8.7.  Adequacy of MAJCOM IG validation. 8.2.1.8.8.  Sufficiency of MAJCOM IG team’s deliberative process. 8.2.1.8.9.  Sufficiency  of  MAJCOM  IG  report  to  include  non-documented/reported unit deficiencies. 8.2.2.  DELETED 8.2.3.  AFIA  reviews  MAJCOM  IG  closure  responses  to  CRITICAL,  SIGNIFICANT  and repeat Minor nuclear surety deficiencies identified in NWTI and previously identified DTRA DNSI  reports.  (T-1)  AFIA  assesses  sufficiency  of  MAJCOM  actions  taken  to  correct  these deficiencies. (T-1)   8.2.4.  AFIA/OV  promotes  AFIS  and  NSI  standardization  by  identifying  and  sharing  IG performance trends, benchmarks, strengths and deficiencies through inspector general cross-tell venues.   100 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 8.3.  Air Force NSI Core Team 8.3.1.  Air  Force  NSI  Core  Team  (AFIA/NI).    A  core  team  of  certified  NSI  inspectors centralized  at  AFIA  will  integrate  with  the  MAJCOM  IG  Teams  on  all  scheduled  and  no-notice NSIs used to  operationally certify and verify nuclear-capable units.  The Core Team will also support NSI re-inspections and select INSIs (see paragraph  6.14). 8.3.2.  The Core Team provides expertise across various nuclear surety MGAs as outlined in Chapter  6.  The  Core  Team  will  support  NSIs  across  the  nuclear-capable  MAJCOMs (AFGSC, AMC and USAFE). 8.3.3.  The  Core  Team  will  combine  with  the  MAJCOM  IG  Team  to  form  a  single  unit, under the direction of the MAJCOM IG Team Chief.  The MAJCOM IG Team Chief retains the authority as the on-scene director and is responsible for determining the inspection grade and  completing  the  inspection  report  to  the  MAJCOM  Commander.    The  Core  Team  will provide the Deputy Team Chief and is responsible for advising the Team Chief on Air Force-wide nuclear inspection standardization.   8.3.4.  Primary objectives of the Core Team are to improve standardization of NSIs, elevate the MAJCOM  IG Team’s inspector  experience and expertise and  contribute to  NSI lessons learned  and  trend  analysis  processes.    Additionally,  Core  Team  members  will  support  the semi-annual  NSI  process  review,  the  NSI  inspector  training  and  certification  program, applicable  conferences  and  meetings  held  throughout  the  nuclear  enterprise,  and/or  duties assigned by AFIA Commander. 8.3.5.  The MAJCOM IG Team Chief and the Deputy Team Chief from the Core Team are responsible for developing full team complement consisting of permanent party, Core Team members, and required SME augmentees.   8.4.  DRU  and  FOA  MIs/UEIs.  AFIA/ET  conducts  MIs  and  UEIs  of  selected  Air  Force HAF/MAJCOM staffs, Direct Reporting Units, Field Operating Agencies and Named Activities.  UEIs will be conducted every 24-30 months IAW Chapter 1, 2 and 4.  MIs will be conducted IAW Chapters 1-3.  FOAs and DRUs will be selected for an MI or UEI according to an analysis of their Mission Directive and an assessment of whether they are a policy making or executing agent.  Organizations that are predominantly policy making will be selected for MIs.  The TIG will be the final approval authority for inspection type selection. 8.4.1.  Inspection  Scope.    Inspected  units  may  rely  on  host  unit  support  for  management  of some programs.  Since the host wing is subject to inspection by their own MAJCOM, AFIA will not  inspect  the host; however, AFIA will assess  the adequacy of host Wing support to the  inspected  unit.    On  the  other  hand,  if  program  support  is  provided  by  a  FOA’s  parent organization, the program management by the parent is subject to inspection by AFIA. 8.5.  AFIA Medical Inspector Support to MAJCOM IGs.  AFIA/SG will provide IG-certified medical core team inspectors at each UEI for wings with medical units.  8.5.1.  MAJCOM IGs and AFIA will use the Air Force Inspection Scheduling Process. 8.5.2.  AFIA/SG  and  MAJCOM  IGs  will  coordinate  the  scope  and  length  of  the  medical component of the UEI NLT 30 days before the 1st day of the Capstone. 8.5.3.  AFIA/SG will determine the AFIA/SG core team composition and size.   AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 101 8.5.3.1.  AFIA/SG and MAJCOM IGs will coordinate augmentation to the medical core team. 8.6.  Active  Duty (MTF)  Accreditation Requirements.  Active  Duty  MTFs  must  update  their  electronic  application  whenever significant changes occur. (T-0) (AD)  Military  Treatment  Facilities 8.6.1.  AD bedded MTFs must update their electronic application upon notification from the Joint  Commission  (TJC),  which  occurs  at  9,  18,  and  27  month  intervals  from  their anniversary  date.  TJC  also  requires  an  annual  self-assessment,  formerly  Periodic Performance  Review  via  electronic  submission,  now  titled  Intracycle  Monitoring/Focus Standard  Assessment  (ICM/FSA).    Reminder  notifications  for  ICM/FSA  submission requirements  are  provided  per  email  to  the  MTF  Commander  15  months  prior  to  the accreditation anniversary date and due dates are posted on the Connect site. 8.6.2.  AD  non-bedded  MTFs  will  be  notified  by  the  Accreditation  Association  of Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) 180 Days prior to their accreditation survey.  They must submit  a  new  application  which  must  be  received  no  later  than  90  days  prior  to  their  re-accreditation  survey  date.    During  the  term  of  accreditation,  AAAHC  also  requires  written notification within 30 days of any significant organizational, operational or financial changes that can occur. (T-0) 8.7.  IG  Team  Support.  Other  AFIA  inspectors  may  supplement  MAJCOM  IG  teams  during inspections of field units.  AFIA inspectors do not write a separate report.  Rated inspectors with current  medical  and  physiological  training  prerequisites  may  fly  as  observers  in  unit  aircraft when appropriate to their inspection role.  Reference paragraph 8.5. for AFIA/SG inspectors. 8.8.  Contingencies  and  Combat.  AFIA  inspectors  may  deploy  to  forward  locations  and  field HQs  during  contingency  and/or  combat  operations  to  observe  processes  and  recommend solutions  to  readiness  problems  beyond  the  control  of  the  local  Air  Force  field  commander.  These visits require approval by the appropriate unified command.  This is not an inspection, but is  an  opportunity  for  an  independent  and  impartial  Air  Force-level  team  to  analyze  systemic readiness problems that may need HAF or higher-level attention.  Refer also to War Mobilization Plan, Volume 1, Annex O.  8.9.  Directed  Inspection  (DI).  This  high-priority  inspection  will  normally  be  executed  by AFIA  and  other  SAF/IG  personnel.    If  necessary,  TIG  may  request  assistance  from  MAJCOM IGs  via  their  commanders  to  conduct  this  inspection.    The  DI  is  usually  time-sensitive  and  the deficiencies  and  recommendations  are  of  significant  interest  to  the  Air  Force,  members  of Congress, or the general public.  The MAJCOM Commander may direct his/her IG to perform a DI when necessary, or may request AFIA’s assistance. 8.10.  The AFIA Analysis Division.  Will collect, monitor, analyze and report on key inspection data  from  across  the  USAF  and  compile  the  data  into  meaningful  information  to  support  Air Force Senior Leader decision making. 8.10.1.  Support SAF/IG with analysis for SECAF/CSAF level briefings. 8.10.2.  Provide Air Force-wide inspection analysis for TIG Brief. 8.10.3.  Report on inspection trends to SAF/IG and other senior leaders across the Air Force. 102 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 8.11.  TIGIRS  Lead  Command.

Air  Force Inspector General  Duty.  IG duty is a position of high public trust.  Personnel selected for an Air Force Inspector General assignment are functional experts selected from Air Force  Specialty  Codes  (AFSCs)  across  the  Air  Force.    They  possess  attributes  of  the  highest professional  standards  and  moral  character;  demonstrate  potential  for  future  service  and continued  promotion;  and  provide  credibility  for  those  Airmen,  family  members,  and  civilians who seek IG assistance.  In addition to these qualities, Airmen selected for IG service will: 9.1.1.  Have  broad,  contemporary  Air  Force  assignment  experience  and  background  that reflects outstanding performance. NSI inspectors must have nuclear experience or experience applicable  to  current  systems  in  their  respective  MAJCOM  prior  to  assignment  as  an inspector.  All nuclear munitions inspectors will have prior nuclear maintenance experience. (T-1) 9.1.2.  Display  moral  attributes  and  personal  traits  that  demonstrate  adherence  to  Air  Force Core Values. (T-1) 9.1.3.

Only in extreme circumstances should an appointing authority select a non-field grade officer to  lead the  IG section.   IG sections led by non-field  grade  officers or enlisted IGs are not perceived by complainants or inspectees to have the same ability as field  grade officers  to:    1)  address  command  issues  such  as  command  climates,  abusive/hostile environments  or other misconduct  by leadership in  the unit;  or 2) inspect and report on the full spectrum of unit effectiveness.   9.1.8.  Wing  Director  of  Inspections  (87IXX)  will  be  an  O-4/civilian  equivalent  or  higher. (T-1) 9.1.9.

White Cell – Comprised of subject matter experts that act as exercise/inspection proctors.  Their role is to provide input and simulation injects under the direction of the Wing IG regarding environment, scenario and operational ability that keep the exercise/inspection on course in an effort to measure a desired objective.  White Space – For the purposes of this instruction, “white space” is defined as available time on a unit’s calendar that unit leadership can utilize to best suit their needs without hindrance from higher headquarters.  Wing – For the purposes of this instruction, the term “Wing” refers to an organization which has a CCIP, and upon which a Unit Effectiveness Inspection (UEI) is conducted.  Throughout this instruction, the term “Wing” is a substitute for the following terms: Wing, DRU, Field Operating Agency (FOA), and Wing-equivalent.  MAJCOM Commanders will determine which organizations should be considered “Wing-equivalents” for the purpose of the Air Force Inspection System.  Wing Inspection Team (WIT) – Refers to a team of subject matter experts that augment the Inspector General staff while executing a CCIP.  For clarity, the term “Wing Inspection Team” will be used even when the unit is a Wing-equivalent, DRU, or FOA.  Duty assignment to the WIT is normally an additional duty.

Facilities 1.1.5. Guidance MGA 1: Managing Resources - Managing Resources will show that Commanders have considered risk in the stewardship of entrusted resources given to them from higher echelon commanders to ensure effective and efficient mission accomplishment. Those resources include: manpower, funds, equipment, facilities and environment, guidance, and Airmen’s time. At the same time, this MGA will show that higher echelon commanders are ensuring adequate resources are provided to subordinate commanders. Likewise, subordinate commanders must inform higher echelon commanders of resource shortfalls. 1.1. Adequacy - Higher echelon commanders are responsible for providing adequate resources to each subordinate commander so that their wings can accomplish its mission.           1.2. Stewardship - Commanders are entrusted with resources to accomplish their Wing’s mission.  Commanders must consider risk in their stewardship of scarce resources to ensure effective and efficient mission accomplishment.             MGA 2: Leading People - Leading People shows that an established and maintained effective communication process is in place and ensures unit members are well disciplined, trained and provided opportunities for personal and professional development.   Wing leadership and supervisors should also foster leading by personal example, paying attention to the welfare and morale of their subordinates, as well as, enforcing cultural standards on conduct, performance, and discipline as outlined in AFI 1-1.  Additionally, include the unit climate which fosters good order and discipline, teamwork, cohesion and trust. A healthy climate ensures members are treated with dignity, respect, and inclusion, and does not tolerate harassment, assault, or unlawful discrimination of any kind. 2.1. Communication - Communication will show a developed two-way vertical and lateral communication system which is agile enough to respond to changes in the environment in a timely manner. In order to develop understanding, intent, and trust communication systems must be able to transmit the Commander's goals, priorities, values, and expectations, while also encouraging feedback.     1.2.1.

Customs, Courtesies and Uniforms 2.2.5. Attention to Detail         2.2. Discipline - Discipline will show a cultivated culture of compliance and accountability while promoting unit and mission pride. Command climate, customs and courtesies, uniform wear, physical fitness, and attention to detail are some indicators of the overall discipline of a unit.           2.3. Training - Unit training should take a building block approach. Individuals must be proficient in career-field specific skills before incorporating those skills into team and unit training. Unit training spanning the entire scope of the unit mission should include total force, joint, or partner-nation opportunities whenever possible. Training should replicate the distributed, chaotic and uncertain nature of expected operating environments.       2.4. Development - Deliberate processes of preparing Airmen through the Continuum of Learning with the required competencies to meet the challenges of current and future operating environments. The unit should have a process to promote institutional development which results in leadership, management, and warrior ethos proficiency. Development of an individual is two-fold:  professional and personal. 2.4.1. Professional           2.4.2. Personal                   2.5. Quality of Life Engagement - Quality of Life Engagement will show that Commanders and supervisors are engaged in the lives of their subordinates, where appropriate, to improve quality of life and promote unit morale.  Additionally, it will be evident that Commanders and supervisors are aware of both on- and off-duty factors affecting the culture and morale of their units.         2.4.1.1. PME 2.4.1.2.

Wasteful, ineffective or unsafe ways of doing business cannot be tolerated. Units should show a fostered culture of innovation and its members should be encouraged to challenge inefficiencies.  A process for identifying and fixing deficiencies should be established and followed. Data-driven decisions and management of risk while also ensuring the unit’s authorities, missions, plans and goals stay strategically aligned are good indicators of unit improvement. A robust self-assessment program incorporated in the CCIP will identify the root cause of deficiencies and enable sharing of benchmark/best practices with other organizations.  The CCIP should also be able to report the discipline of the force, effectiveness, efficiency, and readiness of the Wing. 3.1. Strategic Alignment - Strategic alignment includes aligning authorities with mission requirements. Vision and mission statements should lead to strategic plans that include yearly calendars and annual budgets. Performance metrics should also be established and monitored to enable data-driven decisions. In addition, metrics should be reviewed in light of updated mission requirements to ensure the unit is measuring relevant mission outputs.       3.2. Process Operations - Process operations should show that leaders are aware of critical processes, and constantly seek to improve and standardize those processes to produce more reliable results. Additionally, units should remove any bottle-necks or limiting factors and ensure risk management principles are applied during daily operations. All risks, including safety and risks to personnel, should be considered when analyzing and improving processes.     3.1.1. Authorities 3.1.2. Strategic Planning 3.1.3. Performance Metrics 3.2.1. Key Work Processes 3.2.2. Risk Management             3.2.3. Commitment to Continuous Improvement   3.3. Commander's Inspection Program (CCIP) - A robust commander’s inspection program finds deficiencies and improves mission readiness. Part of this effort must be a self-assessment program where individual Airmen report their compliance with guidance. An independent verification of those reports provides commanders with additional confidence in their validity. The findings from self-assessments and inspections should drive a root-cause analysis which feeds back into the processes described in the strategic alignment sub MGA.               3.4. Data-Driven Decisions - Commanders are expected to make data-driven decisions. When constraints do not allow, commanders may be forced to make decisions with limited data, and are expected to use experience, judgment and all available resources to guide them.       3.3.1.1.

Air Force commanders have threefold mission execution responsibilities: primary mission, Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) readiness, and mission assurance command and control. Commanders must apply good risk management, accept risk and manage resources to adjust the timing, quality, and quantity of their support to meet the requirements of the supported commander. 4.1. Primary Mission (s) - This is the mission described in the Mission Directive, Designed Operational Capability statement, or specified by order of a superior commander. This may be a day-to-day, in-garrison mission, or it may be an expeditionary, deployed mission.   4.1.1. Warfighter or USAF Commander satisfaction 4.1.2. Right Quality 4.1.3. Right Quantity 4.1.4.

Background.  Congress,  as  part  of  the  FY08  National  Defense  Authorization  Act (NDAA),  requires  Inspectors  General  to  inspect  government-provided  facilities  that  house patients  on  medical  hold.    Section  1662,  Access  of  Recovering  Service  Members  to  Adequate Outpatient  Residential  Facilities,  outlines  the  requirement  for  inspecting  and  reporting.    In September  2007,  DoD  issued  standards  for  inspection  of  facilities  for  outpatient  service members.  To ensure compliance with DoD standards, inspectors will use the checklist at the end of this Attachment when performing the WII inspection. (T-0) A8.2.  Notification  of  Inspection  Requirement:  AFPC  Recovery  Care  Coordinators  (RCC) will provide monthly updates on Recovering Service Members (RSM) to host wing installation IGs NLT the 15th of each month.  Host Wing IG POCs will validate inspection requirements and update the AF WII SharePoint Site NLT the last duty day of the month. A8.3.  Pre-Occupancy  Inspection.  The  commander  is  ultimately  responsible  for  ensuring appropriate steps are taken to  meet  the member’s needs.  The goal  is  to  ensure the individual's government-owned  housing  facility  (on-base  housing,  dormitories  and  TLFs)  needs  are  met based  upon  the  RSM’s  medical  condition(s).    In  addition  to  the  scheduled  WII  inspection, MAJCOM IGs will instruct the RSM’s commander to perform a pre-occupancy inspection of the residence  (or  as  soon  as  possible  if  notification  is  not  timely  enough  to  allow  an  inspection before  RSM  physically  occupies  the  government-owned  housing  or  if  the  RSM  occupied  the residence prior to his/her RSM status).  Additional personnel deemed necessary shall accompany the commander on the pre-occupancy inspection (the individual's commander, first sergeant, CE commander, housing/dorm manager, and RCC). (T-1) Submit a copy of the completed checklist and  all  documentation  addressing  deficiencies  to  the  IG  Team  Chief  upon  their  arrival  for  the follow-up inspection. (T-1) A8.4.  Inspection Process.  IG Teams will conduct RSM residence inspections using inspection criteria outlined in Table A8.1. (T-0)  The initial and annual WII inspections will be scheduled and  documented  in  IGEMS.    All  deficiencies  will  be  identified  and  tracked  to  closure  within IGEMS. (T-1) For those RSMs not requiring quarters modification, paragraph A8.6 still applies.   Once  an  inspection  has  been  scheduled  by  the  MAJCOM  IG  or  Wing  IG,  an  inspection notification memo will be sent to the Installation Commander and RSM’s Wing (or equivalent) Commander (if different than the Installation Commander). A8.4.1.  Delegation  Authority.    In  order  to  accomplish  inspections  in  a  timely  manner, MAJCOM IGs may delegate inspection authority to the host installation wing commander. If delegated,  the  host  wing  commander  will  direct  his/her  Wing  IG  to  perform  the  initial  and subsequent  (recurring,  annual)  inspections  of  a  Wounded  Warrior’s  residence  as  defined  in this attachment as part of the CCIP. (T-3)  IG Team Chiefs will forward inspection results to the MAJCOM IG not later than 3 days following the inspection.  (T-2) MAJCOMs, in-turn, will follow report processes as defined in paragraph  A8.8. A8.4.2.  Frequency.  IG-led  inspection  requirements  include  an  initial  inspection  NLT  90 days  from  validation  and  annually  from  the  initial  inspection  date  on  the  government-provided    housing  facility  (on-base  housing,  dormitories  and  TLFs),  for  as  long  as  the recovering  Airman  is  in  Wounded  Warrior  status  and  resides  in  government-provided 154 AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 housing.    Commanders  will  re-inspect  deficient  residencies  not  less  often  than  once  every 180 days until the deficiency is corrected. (T-1) A8.5.  Contracted and Privatized Housing Management.  If housing is privatized or managed by  contracted  personnel,  the  Wing  IG  and  the  installation  leadership  will  work  with  the contractor to ensure the inspection takes place in a timely manner.  Inspections will be performed to the maximum extent permitted by the associated agreement. (T-1) A8.6.  Personal  Interview.  The  IG  Team  Chief  will  also  complete  a  formal  one-on-one interview  with  the  RSM  to  ensure  the  owning  installation  leadership  is  providing  necessary facility  modification  based  upon  the  RSM’s  medical  condition.    This  interview  should  also  be documented in the final report.  The RSM’s family members are encouraged to participate and at the request of the RSM.  A8.7.  Joint Base Housing Facility Inspections.  Regardless of which Service "owns/manages" the  government-provided  housing,  Air  Force  inspectors  will  inspect  housing  occupied  by Airmen;  Army  inspectors  will  inspect  housing  occupied  by  Soldiers;  Navy  inspectors  will inspect  housing  occupied  by  Sailors  and  Marines.  (T-1)  There  is  no  requirement  to  inspect quarters  already  identified/certified  as  DOD  compliant  for  RSM  (e.g.,  Fisher  House,  Malone House); however, the IG Team Chief will interview the RSM to ensure their needs are being met. (T-1)  Although  most  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  compliant  quarters  meet  DOD  standards for  the  Wounded  Warrior  program,  the  IG  Team  Chief  will  interview  the  RSM  to  ensure  the quarters  are  sufficient  and  that  their  needs  are  being  met.  (T-1)  This  interview  need  not  be conducted in-person. A8.8.  Final  Report  Disposition.  Final  reports  in  IGEMS  will  not  include  any  PII  to  include member’s name. (T-1) The IG Team Chief (MAJCOM or Wing) will forward copies of the final report,  with  a  cover  letter  identifying  the  member  by  rank/name  only,  to  the  installation commander,  member’s  Wing  (or  equivalent)  Commander  (if  different  than  the  Installation Commander) and the commander of the affiliated Medical Treatment Facility NLT 10 duty days from finalization of the report. (T-1) The IG Team Chief (MAJCOM or Wing) will ensure their WII  POC  updates  the  inspection  status  on  the  AF  WII  SharePoint  Site.  (T-1)  AFIA  will consolidate all MAJCOM and Wing IG WII reports from IGEMS into a single Service report and disseminate  in  accordance  with  FY08  NDAA,  Section  1662  NLT  30  days  prior  to  the  OSD established closeout date. (T-1) A8.9.  Inspection  Checklist:  The  inspection  checklist  (Table  A8.1)  incorporates  requirements set  forth  by  DoD  and  is  designed  for  a  combination  of  interview,  physical  inspection  and documentation  review.    It  should  be  executed  at  the  location  to  be  inspected  with  the  patient, case manager, and base housing facility representative present.  The primary point of contact for scheduling  the  inspection  should  be  the  case  manager.    When  possible,  the  inspector  should either  review  applicable  documents  prior  to  the  inspection  or  request  the  housing  facility representative  to  bring  such  documents  with  him/her  to  the  inspection.    Documentation  may include  (but  is  not  limited  to)  Pre-Occupancy  Inspection  checklist  with  associated  documents, pending  work  orders  on  the  housing  facility,  work  orders  executed  within  the  past  six  months, asbestos  documentation,  lead  paint  documentation,  pest  control  documentation  &  procedures, and  mold  documentation.    Inspected  areas  will  be  rated  IN  COMPLIANCE,  NOT  IN COMPLIANCE, or IN COMPLIANCE WITH COMMENTS. AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 Table A8.1.  Air Force WII Residence Inspection Checklist.

The  2012  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  (NDAA)  mandates  inspections  of cemeteries  managed  by  the  Services  or  located  on  military  installations  (see  Table  A9.1).  Section 592 of the 2012 NDAA directs the following elements of inspection be assessed by the Inspector General: A9.1.1.  Adequacy  of  the  statutes,  policies,  and  regulations  governing  the  management, oversight,  operations,  and  interments  or  inurnments  (or  both)  by  the  military  cemeteries under  the  jurisdiction  of  that  military  department  and  the  adherence  of  such  military cemeteries to such statutes, policies, and regulations. A9.1.2.  The  system  employed  to  fully  account  for  and  accurately  identify  the  remains interred or inurned in such military cemeteries. A9.1.3.  Contracts  and  contracting processes  and oversight  of those contracts  and processes with regard to compliance with Department of Defense and military department guidelines. A9.1.4.  History  and  adequacy  of  oversight  conducted  by  the  Secretary  of  the  military department  over such military cemeteries and the adequacy of corrective  actions taken as a result of that oversight. A9.1.5.  Statutory  and  policy  guidance  governing  the  authorization  for  the  Secretary  of  the military department to operate such military cemeteries and an assessment of the budget and appropriations structure and history of such military cemeteries. A9.1.6.  Other matters as the Inspector General considers to be appropriate. A9.2.  Inspection  frequency.    It  is  DoD’s  intent  that  cemeteries  receive  an  inspection  on  an annual basis (every 24 months for ANG). To ensure this inspection frequency, the Air Force will inspect according to the following construct: (T-2) A9.2.1.  The  MAJCOM  IG  will  validate  Wing  IG  inspections  and  may  sample  inspect  an installation  cemetery  during  their  Capstone,  on-site  inspection  (as  applicable;  see  Table A9.1). A9.2.2.  Wing IGs will conduct an inspection of the cemetery on their installation as part of the  CCIP.    This  inspection  will  be  accomplished  within  12  months  (24  months  for  ANG) following the MAJCOM’s Capstone UEI. A9.3.  Reports  should  include  any  deficiencies,  recommendations  and  CAPs.    All  deficiencies will  be  identified  and  tracked  to  closure  within  IGEMS.    IGs  will  forward  copies  of  the  final report  to  the  installation  commander  and  AFIA  NLT  10  duty  days  after  inspection  report  is signed.   AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 161 Table A9.1.

This memorandum provides the template for drafting the CCIR.  The CCIR is intended to provide the Wing Commander’s assessment of four Major Graded Areas (MGA):  Managing Resources, Leading People, Improving the Unit, and Executing the Mission.  Please use the address formatting in this template and the major headings provided when drafting your reports.  Additionally, we request wings utilize their own letterhead for this report in lieu of creating report formats.    2.The first paragraph should succinctly summarize the commander’s assessment as an executive summary. The subsequent paragraphs provide a more in-depth analysis of specific MGAs.  There is no required length for this report; however, this is executive-level communications to a MAJCOM Commander and therefore should not exceed two pages total. (T-2)    3. Managing Resources.  This section summarizes how the wing manages its resources. Examples of data that can be included are: progress on spend plans, manpower utilization, facilities concerns as well as concerns regarding guidance within and above the wing.  This section is an opportunity to briefly expand upon how the wing is managing the resources provided as well as highlight resources that are required from above the wing level for mission execution. If an area is summarized as deficient, include a brief synopsis of corrective actions and estimated get well dates.   4. Leading People.  This section summarizes how the wing’s leaders lead their people.  Examples of data that can be included are: vertical and/or horizontal inspections, quality of life initiatives, disciplinary trends, status of training and force development trends.  If an area is summarized as deficient, include a brief synopsis of corrective actions and estimated get well dates.  5.Improving the Unit.  This section summarizes how the wing improves the unit.  Assessment of the wing’s transition to the CCIP is mandatory.  Include status of standing up the Wing AFI90-201  21 APRIL 2015 163 Inspection Team, results of local inspections, progress of the Commanders Inspection Management Board, and MICT implementation. Other information/data that can be included are: results of strategic planning, AFSO 21 initiatives and other unit improvement initiatives.  If an area is summarized as deficient, include a brief synopsis of corrective actions and estimated get well dates.   6.Executing the Mission.  This section summarizes how the wing executes its mission.  Utilize this paragraph to address: warfighter satisfaction, producing the right quality and quantity to meet mission demands, the scope of the mission, as well as risk management.  Data may include, but is not limited to:  deployment history and results, risk management decisions made to support the mission and a brief summary of issues previously raised via DRRS, SORTS and ART reports.  If an area is summarized as deficient, include a brief synopsis of corrective actions and estimated get well dates.   7.Summary:  Utilize this section to reemphasize where the unit is performing well, where additional resources are necessary, and any other expounding/pertinent items necessary.   8. Note:  the CCIR is a commander-to-commander communiqué.  The intent is for each commander to assess and report how their wing is performing utilizing the above listed MGAs.  As the CCIR covers an assessment of the wing’s ability to execute their assigned mission, this report should be classified appropriately.
