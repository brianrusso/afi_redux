As a trainer, the QTPs provide you with the breakdown of tasks into teachable elements. The teachable elements will help you to guide the trainee toward sufficient proficiency for task performance without assistance. QTPs are also used by the task certifiers/certification official to evaluate trainees concerning tasks which need third-party certification. 2. Review each volume and identify which modules of QTPs are needed for the trainee’s job position. Core taskitems are identified with the number “5” on the STS Column 2; these items are the minimum mandatory skills which are required for all 4N0X1 personnel to be proficient in performing. You have the flexibility to arrange training for each module in the order that you decide. 3. Review the subject-area tasks in each module with the trainee. Direct the trainee to review the trainingreferences to gain a better understanding of the objective for each module. If the trainee has any questions about the objective, clarify the behavior that is expected in the objective. Review the performance checklist with the trainee, and allow him/her sufficient time to learn each step (some objectives may take longer to teach). Remember--the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and to allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task without assistance. 4. When the trainee receives sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluationinstructions. The performance checklist must be used as you evaluate each task objective. When the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document task completion appropriately in AFTR. 5.The QTP task completion is to be annotated on AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and RecurringTraining, filed in Part 3, Section B in AFTR. NOTE: The individual checklists are not filed in each member’s AFTR. A master checklist is filed in Part 3, Section B of the hardcopy Master Training Plan (MTP) folder. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas which need remediation. Conduct a feedback6.concerning each module with the trainee, and document appropriately in AFTR. As the trainer, when you are satisfied that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, he/she will be re-evaluated until the objective is met. If the task which is being trained requires third-party certification by a task certifier/certifying official, the7.trainer first must ensure that the trainee is qualified to perform the task without assistance. Then the trainee will be evaluated by a task certifier/certifying official. The tasks which require third-party certification are denoted with a “^” in Column 3E of the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). After third-party certification, training qualification is documented appropriately in AFTR. The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing refresher/sustainment training. Such standardization will8.benefit the CFETP training concept throughout each member’s career. These documents also will be utilized for assessing/certifying the Aerospace Medical Service Specialist each time that he/she is assigned to a new duty position. The QTP developers’ goal is to publish a usable document for certifying officials, trainers, and trainees for the purpose of enhancing on-the-job training for Aerospace Medical Service Specialty personnel. We value your first-hand expertise, and we encourage your feedback.

Select the appropriate sized spray tip based upon the diameter and thicknessof the lesion. 2. Hold the canister in the upright position approximately 1cm away fromthe wart. 3. Squeeze cryostat trigger to apply liquid nitrogen until the wart and 1mm to2 mm of the surrounding tissue appears white (frozen). a. Use a steady stream of liquid nitrogen of short duration centered on thelesion for small flat warts.  b. Use short bursts of liquid nitrogen moving from one quadrant to anotherto achieve a uniform application and depth of freezing for larger broad warts.  c. Allow the area to thaw (skin will gradually return to normal appearance).Note: Normal thaw cycle may vary between 10-30 seconds depending on several factors including wart size, location and/or wart thickness.   4. Repeat treatment 2-3 times depending on the provider’s order.5. Provide patient home care instructions and educational material6. Schedule patient for follow-up appointment in 2-3 weeks.7. Document all aspects of treatment IAW Wart Treatment SSPNOTE:  If a spray canister is not available, cryotherapy may be applied to  the wart by direct contact using commercial product such as Histofreeze  or a cotton tip applicator dipped in a Styrofoam cup of liquid nitrogen.   For commercial products, follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the  label.  If using LN2 in a stryofoam cup, submerge a cotton tip applicator  for several seconds in the LN2, remove and apply directly to the center of the wart.  Several applications may be necessary to achieve desired results.   8 WART REMOVAL USING A TOPICAL AGENT iA l   h1.  Allow chemical to dry.2. Apply dressing to site.3.
