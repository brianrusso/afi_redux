As  a  military  escort,  you  are  an  official  representative  of  the  US  Air  Force  under circumstances  that  demand  consistently  respectful  behavior,  neat  appearance,  and  an understanding  of  grief  responses  on  the  part  of  the  next  of  kin.  You  immediately  assume  a role in one of the most psychologically sensitive human conditions known. Your awareness of  and  ability  to  successfully  cope  with  these  emotional  interactions  will  be  of  long-term benefit to the families served. 3.2.  Your  conduct  should  always  reflect  credit  upon  the  Air  Force.  The  functions  of administering funeral service and religious counseling are the professional responsibilities of the funeral director and clergy, respectively. Further, it is not  your responsibility to offer or volunteer  information  relating  to  the  circumstances  of  the  death,  the  recovery  and/or identification  of  the  remains,  antemortem  or  postmortem  diagnostic  findings,  or  the professional preparations of the remains for viewing and/or burial. 3.2.1.  As  an  Air  Force  representative,  DO  NOT  inconvenience  the  family.  You  will arrange for all your personal needs (such as meals, lodging and transportation).  Do not solicit and avoid accepting invitations, gratuities and gifts, or favors from the family and friends  of  the  deceased,  merchants  in  the  area  or  local  officials.  Invitations  to  related events (memorial service in addition to the funeral service, or funeral service reception) can be accepted on a case-by-case basis. 3.2.2.  Refrain from discussing the nature of your assignment with anyone while en route to  or  from  your  destination  or  during  your  stay  at  the  destination  other  than  necessary communication with airline representatives, the family, and the family’s funeral director relating to your assigned escort duties. 3.2.3.  Less  than  acceptable  conduct,  the  use  of  inaccurate  information,  and  the  lack  of compassionate understanding may cause both  harm  and embarrassment  to  the family of the  deceased  and  to  the  Air  Force.  It  is  extremely  important  that  you  be  alert  to  your responsibilities at all times. 3.3.  Escort uniform is the service dress.  This uniform will be worn in accordance with AFI 36-2903,  Dress  and  Personal  Appearance  of  Air  Force  Personnel,  at  all  times  during  the escort assignment.  NOTE: Mourning bands are not worn by escorts. AFPAM34-504  16 FEBRUARY 2016 5 4.  Prescribed Duties. 4.1.  Transportation of Remains Over Land. 4.1.1.  Before  departure  to  destination,  secure  travel  orders  and  all  appropriate documentation,  as  needed  to  accomplish  your  duties.  Receive  a  thorough  briefing  from the  mortuary  officer  or  technician  regarding  your  escort  responsibilities,  including  a review of the essential information listed in paragraph 2. 4.1.2.  Accompany the remains from the contract funeral home or port mortuary facility in the hearse, with the funeral director. It is permissible to follow behind the hearse in a government owned vehicle or rental car, to the receiving funeral home. 4.2.  Transportation  of  Remains  by  Commercial  Air  or  MilAir/Contract  MilAir  (for  deaths occurring in a combat theater of operation). 4.2.1.  Before  departure  to  destination,  secure  travel  orders,  air  carrier  tickets,  and  all appropriate  documentation,  as  needed  to  accomplish  your  duties.  Receive  a  thorough briefing  from  the  mortuary  officer  or  technician  regarding  your  escort  responsibilities, including a review of the essential information listed in paragraph 2. 4.2.2.  Accompany the  remains from  the funeral  home or port mortuary facility, usually with the funeral director, to the air carrier. Stay with the remains until properly assigned to  the  carrier.  Make  sure  the  remains  are  safeguarded,  out  of  public  view,  and  under cover. 4.2.2.1.  Should  an  unexpected  scheduling  change  occur,  telephone  the  primary mortuary officer, alternate mortuary officer, or mortuary technician, who will, in turn, notify  the  receiving  funeral  director  and  dignified  arrival  Honor  Guard  of  such changes.    If  you  cannot  reach  the  mortuary  officer,  alternate  mortuary  officer,  or mortuary  technician,  contact  the  receiving  funeral  home  immediately  to  advise  of schedule change. 4.2.2.2.  If security measures at the air carrier terminal or scheduling changes prevent you  from  staying  with  the  remains,  the  local  agent  will  take  responsibility  for  the remains. In this event, request access to visually verify the correct remains are loaded on the aircraft prior to boarding. 4.2.3.  Upon  arrival  at  destination  airport  you  will  be  met  by  a  seven  -person  Honor Guard Detail, funeral director, or his or her representative. Six personnel from the Honor Guard detail will transfer the casket from the aircraft to the next mode of transportation. During this movement, the escort and the 7th Honor Guard Member will render a salute. 4.2.3.1.  Following transfer of the remains from the air carrier or terminal area to the funeral director’s hearse, drape the flag over the outer shipping container or the casket from  which  the  outer  shipping  cover  has  been  removed.  Drape  the  flag  lengthwise over  the  shipping  container  or  casket  with  the  union  at  the  head  and  over  the  left shoulder of the deceased (see Figure 2).    6 AFPAM34-504  16 FEBRUARY 2016 4.3.  Procedures for Displaying the Flag With the Casket. 4.3.1.  Closed Casket:  4.3.1.1.  Center the flag on the casket with the blue field at the head and over the left shoulder of the deceased as shown below in Figure 2 Figure 2.  Closed Casket. 4.3.2.  Open Half Couch Casket:  4.3.2.1.  Fold the flag in a simple “S” fold, as shown in Figure 3, and place it on the lower panel of the casket as shown in Figure 4  4.3.2.2.  Simple “S” Fold Instructions (see Figure 3): 4.3.2.2.1.  Position casket throw on lower panel of casket. 4.3.2.2.2.  Fold flag toward foot of casket to a point just past the slit that separates the head and foot panels. 4.3.2.2.3.  Fold flag toward head of casket to a point even with the first fold at the slit between panels. 4.3.2.2.4.  Fold  hoist  edge  under;  fold  should  only  equal  width  of  hoist  edge. Hoist edge should not show. 4.3.2.2.5.  Align stripes of all folds and make sure flag is centered on casket. AFPAM34-504  16 FEBRUARY 2016 7 Figure 3.  Simple “S” Fold Instructions. Figure 4.  Open Half Couch Casket.   4.3.3.  “Cocked Hat” Flag Display: 4.3.3.1.  When  floral  arrangement  or  other  object  is  placed  on  the  lower  panel  of casket,  display  the  flag  in  the  cocked  hat  design  and  place  it  in  the  head  panel  as shown in Figure 5 8 AFPAM34-504  16 FEBRUARY 2016 Figure 5.  “Cocked Hat” Flag Display.  4.4.  Deliver  all  appropriate  documents  to  the  funeral  director  or  government  cemetery representative. 4.5.  Determine through the mortuary officer or technician whether or not the family wishes you to be present for the funeral service. At the request of the family, a stopover period of 72 hours  is  authorized.  You  may  be  requested  by  the  funeral  director  or  government  cemetery representative to participate in some part of the graveside service. If so, find out exactly what is expected. 4.6.  If  circumstances  of  an  emergency  or  unusual  nature  (i.e.,  delay  or  cancellation  in  any flight,  damaged  casket  or  soiled  casket  interior)  arise,  you  should  immediately  notify  the primary  mortuary  officer,  alternate  mortuary  officer,  or  mortuary  technician,  as  listed  in paragraph  2.2 4.7.  Viewing the remains is the prerogative of the survivors. Opening the casket and making such  viewing  possible  is  the  funeral  director’s  responsibility.  Should  the  funeral  director identify any concerns, ensure the funeral director makes immediate contact with the mortuary officer,  alternate  mortuary  officer,  or  mortuary  technician  for  corrective  measures.  Every attempt shall be made to mitigate unexpected circumstances without family involvement. 4.8.  On return to home or duty station, complete AF Form 1947 and deliver to the mortuary officer or technician. Include any observations or difficulties encountered and the Air Force function  in  connection  with  transportation,  funeral,  military  honors,  or  any  other  matter directly or indirectly related to Air Force Mortuary Affairs responsibilities. 5.  The Family of the Deceased Member. 5.1.  Possible Grief Responses of Family Members. The attitude of the family toward the loss of a loved one varies. Full and  complete recognition and acceptance of the death  is  seldom immediate,  and  during  the  period  following  death,  the  military  escort  may  witness  several different emotional responses. 5.1.1.  As the escort,  you need to realize that grief responses expressed by the bereaved, such  as  withdrawal,  rejection,  anger,  or  hostility,  are  normal  reactions  to  death  and  are not being directed toward specific individuals. AFPAM34-504  16 FEBRUARY 2016 9 5.1.2.  As  an  Air  Force  representative,  you  may  symbolize  associated  circumstances relating  to  the  loss  and  therefore,  you  may  become  a  temporary  object  of  one  or  more grief emotions. You are expected and required to act in the best interest of the family and of  the  Air  Force  at  all  times.  In  your  special  role,  this  may  be  best  affected  by  being  a patient and understanding listener, rather than a poorly qualified counselor. 5.1.3.  Do  not  impose  on  the  privacy  of  the  family’s  grief,  but  maintain  a  state  of convenient availability should your presence be required or requested. 5.2.  Communicating with Family Members. 5.2.1.  Do  not  attempt  to  answer  specific  questions  on  subjects  such  as  insurance, gratuities,  awards  and  decorations  or  status  of  personal  effects  and  property.    If  asked, advise  the  next  of  kin  that  you  will  provide  their  questions  to  their  Family  Assistance Representative (FAR), who will contact them.   6.  Interment Flag. 6.1.  Display of Interment Flag.   6.1.1.  Position the flag so the union (blue/star field) is at the head and over left shoulder of the deceased (see Figure 4.1). 6.1.2.  Transportation Over Land. The flag will be draped over the casket and displayed throughout the movement from the contract funeral home or port mortuary facility to the receiving funeral home or national cemetery. 6.1.3.  Transportation  by  Commercial  Air  or  MilAir/Contract  MilAir  (for  deaths occurring  in  a  combat  theater  of  operation).  On  arrival  at  the  air  terminal  at  final destination, drape the flag over the shipping container, or if removed from the air tray, the closed casket. 6.2.  The flag may drape a closed casket or half-opened casket.  See Figure 4.1 and  4.3 for proper display procedures. 6.3.  Flag Procedure at the Graveside.  NOTE:  For your information only. 6.3.1.  When  the  casket  has  been  carried  to  the  grave  and  positioned  on  the  lowering device,  the  noncommissioned  officer  in  charge  (NCOIC)  brings  the  bugler  and  firing party to Order Arms. The Honor Guard elements of firing party, bugler, and color guard are  brought  to  Parade  Rest.  The  pallbearers  then  lift  the  interment  flag  from  the  casket and hold it tautly, waist high, over the grave. 6.3.2.  At the conclusion of Taps, the pallbearers fold the flag in the prescribed manner. The pallbearer at the head of the casket, on the side where the family is seated, is the last pallbearer to have possession of the newly folded flag. After ensuring the flag fold is tight and smooth, the pallbearer hands the flag to the designated person who is to present the flag  to  the  next  of  kin.  The  flag  may  be  presented  by  you,  the  chaplain  or  clergy,  the funeral ceremonial team officer in charge (OIC), or the NCOIC. 6.3.2.1.  If you are designated to present an interment flag.  While you are presenting the  flag  to  the  recipient,  you  will  state  “On  behalf  of  the  President  of  the  United States, the United States Air Force, and a grateful nation, please accept this flag as a symbol of our appreciation for your loved one’s honorable and faithful service.” 10 AFPAM34-504  16 FEBRUARY 2016 6.3.2.1.1.  For  presentations  of  multiple  interment  flags,  per  the  authorized receipents listed in paragraph  6.3.3, you will state the verbiage listed in paragraph  6.3.2.1 for each family member flag presentation. 6.3.3.  The designated person will present flag(s) to the following authorized recipients: 6.3.3.1.  Spouse (if not legally separated or divorced). 6.3.3.2.  Children (both adult and minor). 6.3.3.3.  Parents  of  the  fallen  Airman.  If  married,  the  parents  will  receive  one  flag together. If divorced or legally separated, each parent will receive a flag. 6.3.3.4.  PADD if not already covered in paragraph 6.3.3.1. –  6.3.3.3   NOTE: The mortuary  officer  where  the  death  occurred  will  provide  the  flag  to  drape  the  casket. The  installation  providing  Military  Funeral  Honors  will  furnish  the  additional required number of flags.  When there are multiple flag recipients, there should be a chair  or  small  table  in  the  vicinity  of  the  head  of  the  grave  to  accommodate  the additional, pre- folded flags. The flag draping the casket during the service is the first to  be  presented,  and  is  presented  to  the  PNOK,  unless  otherwise  requested.  The additional flags are presented to the other authorized recipient(s).  GINA M.
