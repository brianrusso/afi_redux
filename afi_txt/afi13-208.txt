SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  document  is  substantially  revised  and  must  be  completely  reviewed.  Major  changes include:  changes  the  name  of  this  instruction  to  Personnel  Recovery  Coordination  Cell Organization  and  Training;  removes  references  to  establishing  a  PRCC  outside  of  the  AOC; revises  PRCC  organizational  makeup  (paragraph  4.);  revises  PRCC  training  requirements (paragraph 5. and Table 5.1.). 1.  General.  Personnel Recovery (PR) is a core function of the Air Force and one of its highest priorities across the range of military operations. To fulfill its Department of Defense (DOD) PR responsibilities  and  establish  and  implement  a  global  PR  program,  the  Air  Force  prepares commanders  and  staffs,  dedicated  Rescue  forces,  and  personnel  at  risk  of  isolation  (military, civilian and DOD contractor) to accomplish the five PR execution tasks (report, locate, support, recover,  and  reintegrate).    A  COMAFFOR  exercises  authority  and  responsibility  for  planning and conducting PR in support of Air Force operations, or as tasked by a Joint Force Commander (JFC), through an AOC, specifically, the PRCC within the AOC. 1.1.  Purpose.  This  instruction  provides  guidance  for  the  organization  of  a  COMAFFOR AOC  PRCC  and  the  training  of  PRCC  personnel  to  effectively  plan,  coordinate,  task,  and control execution of COMAFFOR PR operations and related activities 2.  Responsibilities. 2.1.  HQ ACC/A3J.  HQ Air Combat Command (ACC) Personnel Recovery Division (A3J) is  OPR  for  this  instruction,  and  will  coordinate  recommended  changes  with  geographic  C-MAJCOM  and  Component-Numbered  Air  Force  HQs  and  their  numbered  AOC  units  and forward to AF/A3O-AS for approval and publishing. C-MAJCOM and C-NAF Commanders 2.2.  Geographic (Theater COMAFFORs).  Theater COMAFFORs are responsible for planning and conducting PR in support of their own operations or as tasked by a JFC.  They should establish a PRCC within their  AOC  to  prepare  for,  plan,  and  coordinate  AFFOR  PR  operations  across  the  range  of military  operations  throughout  a  JFC’s  assigned  operational  area.      Theater  COMAFFORs should ensure their AOCs, including the PRCCs, are manned at the minimum core capability necessary  to  meet  the  unique  demands  of  their  theater’s  steady  state  operations  as  well  as their  most  likely  contingency  scenarios  and  should  also  be  prepared  to  surge  to  the  most likely wartime scenario until augmentation from Regular Air Force (RegAF) and Air Reserve Component (ARC) units is available.  They should be prepared to establish a Joint Personnel Recovery  Center  (JPRC),  if  assigned  as  the  combined  or  joint  force  air  component commander  (C/JFACC)  and  tasked  by  the  Geographic  Combatant  Commander  (GCC)  or  a subordinate  JFC  as  the  joint  force  supported  commander  for  PR.    In  this  case,  the COMAFFOR’s  AOC  will  be  designated  as  the  C/JFACC’s  combined/joint  air  operations center (C/JAOC) and the AOC PRCC will be augmented from other components to provide AFI13-208  4 AUGUST 2015   3  sustained  24/7  operations.    This  does  not  negate  responsibility  for  performing  duties  as  the AFFOR PRCC, in addition to JPRC responsibilities. 2.3.  Geographic AOC and ARC Aligned AOC Unit Commanders.  Geographic AOC and ARC-aligned AOC unit commanders are responsible for ensuring all personnel permanently assigned  to  a  geographic  AOC  PRCC  or  a  PRCC-gained  unit  line  number  (ULN)  receive initial qualification training (IQT) prescribed by this instruction either en route (preferred) or within  timeline  established  in  AFI13-1AOC,  Volume  1,  Ground  Environment  Training  Air Operations Center (AOC). (T-2) 2.4.  AOC  PRCC  Chief.  AOC PRCC chief is  responsible for day-to-day operations of the PRCC and for coordinating with the AOC commanders and unit training managers to ensure all assigned PRCC personnel are properly trained IAW this instruction.  The PRCC chief is responsible for providing PR-trained personnel to AOC divisions, as required, to accomplish PRCC responsibilities and functions during theater steady state and contingency operations. Refer to Joint Publication (JP) 3-50, Personnel Recovery, and AFDD 3-50 for descriptions of typical PRCC (or JPRC) responsibilities and functions. 3.  PRCC Requirements. 3.1.  Facility  Requirements.  The  PRCC  Chief  must  coordinate  with  the  AOC  weapon system manager (WSM) to ensure sufficient workspace is available to accommodate at least five and up to 10 PRCC personnel on the Combat Operations Division (COD) floor per shift for  continuous  24-hour  operations.    Workspace  must  also  have  room  for  PRCC  computer systems,  and  communications  equipment  (see  paragraphs  3.2  and  3.3  below).  Additionally, the  AOC  WSM  should  also  provide  two  workspaces  for  PRCC  personnel  working  in  the Combat Plans Division (CPD) on Master Air Attack Plan (MAAP) Team. The PRCC should also be provided adequate office workspace within the AOC facility for the PRCC chief and other  non-shift  personnel  to  work  off  the  COD  floor  for  accomplishing  PR  operational planning;  Survival,  Evasion,  Resistance  and  Escape  (SERE)  program  management;  and daily, routine administrative tasks. 3.2.  System Requirements. 3.2.1.  Equipment  and  Application  Requirements.  Since  the  PRCC  is  an  integral  part  of the  AOC  weapon  system,  all  equipment  necessary  to  operate  the  PRCC  must  be contained in the AOC baseline or have an approved variance to operate in the AOC. (T-2) 3.2.2.  Computer Workstations. The recommended workstation configuration is a single, windows-based  operating  system  with  dual  monitors.  Each  workstation  must  be configured  to  access  both  SECRET  Internet  Protocol  Router  Network  and  Non-Secure Internet  Protocol  Router  Network  central  processing  units  using  a  common  monitor, keyboard, and mouse through a keyboard-video-mouse sharing device. (T-2) 3.2.3.  Workstation  Applications.  Each  PRCC  workstation  must  have  access to applications identified in the AOC baseline (or an approved variance) that are relevant to planning,  coordinating,  and  monitoring  execution  of  PR  operations.  These  applications include but are not limited to Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS), AOC Portal, Google EarthTM mapping service, FalconView, Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination  System  (JADOCS),  and  Trans  Verse  (or  other  collaborative  tools).  PR   4  AFI13-208  4 AUGUST 2015 unique  applications  include  Combat  Survivor/Evader  Locator  (CSEL)  Web  Server Application  (CWSA)  and  Personnel  Recovery  Mission  Software  (PRMS)  web-based programs.  They also require access to Microsoft® SharePoint® and the standard suite of Microsoft® Office® applications for accomplishing daily routine PRCC activities. (T-2) 3.2.4.  Search  and  Rescue  (SAR)  Satellite-Aided  Tracking  (SARSAT).  Due  to  the proliferation  of  406  MHz  emergency  beacons  used  by  military  forces,  the  PRCC  must have availability to SARSAT alerts. This can be accomplished by contacting the United States  Air  Force  Rescue  Coordination  Center  at  DSN  523-5955,  Commercial  850-283-5955. (T-2) 3.3.  Communications  Requirements.  Isolating  events  are  time-sensitive  and  rapidly evolving dynamic situations. Successful recovery of isolated personnel depends upon rapid, reliable,  and  secure  communications  for  prompt  receipt  of  distress  information,  alerting supporting  agencies,  launching  forces,  and  coordinating  and  controlling  subsequent  PR operations. Joint and AFFOR component command, control, communications, computers and intelligence  (C4I)  planning  must  include  AFFOR  PR  communications  requirements  and inter-service  and  functional  component  C4I  interoperability.    C4I  planning  must  address communicating  from  air-to-air,  air-to-surface,  or  surface-to-surface.  The  PRCC  must maintain  a  close  liaison  with  local  communication  representatives  to  obtain  assistance,  to evaluate  communications  needs  and  support,  and  to  ensure  effective  and  adequate  service. The AOC WSM must provide PRCC communications capabilities. (T-2) 3.3.1.  Voice  Communications.  Each  workstation  must  be  equipped  with  a  Secure Telephone Unit (STU), Secure Telephone Equipment (STE), voice over internet protocol (VOIP),  or  any  other  common  secure-voice  communication  system  used  in  the  AOC. Automatic  access  to  theater-wide  telecommunications,  including  Defense  Switched Network,  Defense  Red  Switch  Network,  and  international  dialing,  must  be  available  in order  for  the  PRCC  or  JPRC  to  coordinate  with  the  Combatant  Command  and  other components.  The PRCC requires the ability to communicate securely, over the horizon, with  air  component  forces  involved  in  a  PR  mission  directly  or  through  an  Airborne Mission  Coordinator  (AMC).  The  theater  PR  staff  must  coordinate  SAR  frequency requirements  and  authorizations,  to  include  dedicated  PR  satellite  communication (SATCOM) nets, during the operational planning phase. (T-2) 4.  Organization. 4.1.  PRCC  Positions  and  Functions  in  the  AOC.    The  PRCC  is  an  integral  part  of  the AOC  and  the  hub  for  all  AFFOR  PR  operations  and  related  activities.    It’s  organized  as  a specialty AFI13-208  4 AUGUST 2015   5  Figure 4.1.  Notional PRCC Integration in an AOC.  team within the COD, with some PRCC personnel integrated in or working closely with other AOC divisions to facilitate the planning, coordinating, and executing of AFFOR PR missions, including the reintegration of recovered AFFOR personnel.  The PRCC is typically composed of a chief; deputy chief; plans officers; duty officers; controllers; intelligence specialists; and Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) specialists, described below.  Refer to AFI 13-1 AOC, Volume 3, Operational Procedures – Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), and Air Force Tactics Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-3.AOC, Operational Employment, Air Operations Center, for AOC processes used during major contingency operations and how PR requirements are input by PRCC or JPRC. Figure 4.1. depicts how a notional PRCC is integrated into the AOC. 4.1.1.  PRCC  Chief/Deputy  Chief.  The  COMAFFOR  directs  AFFOR  PR  operations through the PRCC chief, who is responsible to the COD Chief and the Chief of Combat Operations (CCO) for the day-to-day operations  of the PRCC.  Additionally, the PRCC chief normally serves as the attached PR representative to  the AOC Strategy Division’s (SRD) core teams for analyzing the PR requirements of operational plans and anticipated future  operations,  and  assessing  the  effectiveness  of  current  PR  operations  and recommending  appropriate  changes  to  PR  force  posture  and/or  guidance.    The  PRCC deputy chief assists the PRCC chief in the performance of their responsibilities and works opposite  the  assigned  shift  of  the  PRCC  chief  and  CCO  when  24-hour  operations  are required to manage PRCC activities. If the PRCC is tasked to function as the JPRC, the PRCC chief will normally be designated as the JPRC director. The JPRC deputy director may be designated from  another component.  Recommended number and rank: 1 x O-5 (chief),  1  x  O-4  (deputy  chief).  Recommended  Air  Force  Specialty  Codes  (AFSC):   6  AFI13-208  4 AUGUST 2015 11/12H,  13D,  11F  (Sandy-qualified),  or  other  Service  equivalents.    GS  civilians  who possess equivalent operational experience may be substituted with approval of the AOC Director. 4.1.2.  Personnel  Recovery  Plans  Officer  (PRPO).  The  PRPOs  are  responsible  for development of detailed plans for execution of PR operations published in the daily Air Tasking  Order  (ATO)  based  on  JFC/JFACC  guidance  using  available  PR  assets.  The PRPOs  work  in  the  MAAP  Team  force  enhancement  cell,  but  also  provide  rescue expertise  to  Combat  Plans  Division  (CPD)  Command  and  Control  Planning  Team. Specifically,  PRPOs  work  closely  with  airspace  management  planning  cell, communications  planning  cell,  and  the  special  instructions  (SPINS)  cell  in  the  C2 Planning  Team  to  coordinate  airspace  and  communications  requirements  to  support rescue operations, and to coordinate inputs/changes to the PR section of the ATO SPINS, respectively.  During high tempo and rapidly shifting phases of operations, one or more PRPOs may be assigned by the PRCC chief to  work full-time with  CPD MAAP Team.  During  slower  periods  of  operations,  it  may  only  be  necessary  for  part-time  PRCC representation  on  the  MAAP  Team.    Recommended  number  and  rank:  3  x  O-4. Recommended  AFSCs:  11/12H  or  13D,  11F  (Sandy-qualified),  or  other  Service equivalents.    GS  civilians  who  possess  equivalent  operational  experience  may  be substituted with approval of the AOC Director. 4.1.3.  Personnel  Recovery  Duty  Officer  (PRDO).  The  PRDOs  are  responsible  for monitoring ATO execution and the status of all dedicated PR alert assets.   They notify PR  units  of  isolating  events  to  initiate  recovery  planning.  The  PRDOs  coordinate  with other COD duty officers, specialty team members, and liaisons to execute immediate PR missions  and  monitors  PR  packages  from  departure  through  recovery.  They  must  know the  details  of  each  package  in  which  PR  forces  participate.  They  also  pass  critical information  to/from  PR  forces  to  accomplish  the  recovery  successfully.  Recommended number and rank: 3 x O-3.  Recommended AFSCs:  11/12H, 13D, 11F (Sandy-qualified), or other Service equivalents.  GS civilians who possess equivalent operational experience may be substituted with approval of the AOC Director. 4.1.4.  PRCC  Controllers.  PRCC  controllers  maintain  execution  checklists  and documentation for all AFFOR isolated personnel and PR missions in appropriate incident logs  and/or  electronic  databases.    PRCC  controllers  will  prepare  and  send  required messages traffic, such as the SAR incident report (SARIR) and SAR situation summary report (SARSIT), IAW JP 3-50.  They obtain isolated personnel (IP) data from the PRMS database or the IP’s unit and pass it through the most secure means available to the tasked PR  units,  the  JPRC,  and  other  supporting  organizations,  as  required,  to  identify  and authenticate  the  IP  during  mission  execution.    PRCC  controllers  work  closely  with  the PRDO and assist the PRDO as needed.  Recommended number and rank: 1 x E-6, 5 x E-5. Recommended AFSC: 1C5X1. Note: An officer in grade O-3 with an 86P AFSC may substitute for an enlisted controller authorization.  GS civilians who possess equivalent operational experience may be substituted with approval of the AOC Director. 4.1.5.  PR  Intelligence  Officer/NCO.      Some  AOCs  may  embed  intelligence  specialists into  the  PRCC.    In  all  cases,  intelligence  specialists  will  be  assigned  to  the  AOC AFI13-208  4 AUGUST 2015   7  Intelligence,  Surveillance,  and  Reconnaissance  Division  (ISRD)  and  attached  to  the PRCC.    These attached intelligence specialists maintain liaison between the PRCC and the  COD  Senior  Intelligence  Duty  Officer  (SIDO)  team  and  ISRD  core  teams/cells  to maintain  a  current  and  accurate  picture  of  the  overall  threat  environment  and  to coordinate intelligence collection during PR operations planning and mission execution.  ISRD  chiefs  should  designate  in  writing  Analysis,  Correlation  and  Fusion  (ACF)  team officers  and  Noncommissioned  Officers  (NCO)  to  perform  PRCC  duties  during contingency  operations,  as  required.    These  individuals  will  meet  the  PRCC  training requirements prescribed in Table 5.1 and maintain qualification and currency as outlined in  AFI  13-1  AOC,  Volume  1.    Recommended  number  and  rank:  Officers:  1  x  O-3; Enlisted: 2 x E-5.  Recommended AFSCs: Officers: 14N; Enlisted: 1N0XX.  GS civilians who  possess  equivalent  operational  experience  may  be  substituted  with  approval  of  the AOC Director. 4.1.6.  SERE  Specialists.  A  PRCC  SERE  specialist,  designated  the  SERE  program manager,  provides  overall  management  of  operational-level  SERE  programs  within  the AOC, to  include coordinating SERE debriefing during  reintegration operations with  the JPRC.  Successful  management  of  SERE  programs  requires  close  coordination  between the SERE specialists and the AFFOR PR staff.  All PRCC SERE specialists function as  subject  matter  experts  (SME)  within  the  AOC  on  subjects  including  isolated  personnel reports (ISOPREP), evasion  plans of action (EPA), blood  chits, evasion  charts, survival radios,  and  other  PR  aids.    They  assist  in  developing  PR  policies  and  SPINS,  provide SERE  briefings  and  support  operational  activities  for  units  at  various  locations throughout  the  AOR.    In  order  to  expedite  and  aid  in  travel,  PRCC  SERE  specialists should  be  placed  on  Mission  Essential  Personnel  letters  IAW  AFI  11-401,  Aviation Management, para 1.6.3.5.  SERE specialists also provide support during active missions.  Recommended number and rank: 1 x E-7, 2 x E-5. Recommended AFSC: 1T0X1. 4.2.  Augmenting  PRCC  Personnel.  Since  each  geographic  AOC’s  steady-state  “core” capability  is  manned  to  meet  its  theater-unique  day-to-day  operations,  AOCs  must  rely  on augmentation  personnel  from  RegAF  and  ARC  units  to  support  higher  levels  of  effort.  Manning for 24 hour operations will be at a minimum three shifts of 1 x PRCC chief/deputy chief/plans officer, 1 x PRCC duty officer, 1 x SERE specialist, 2 x PRCC controllers, 1 x intelligence  officer/NCO.    When  requirements  exceed  capability;  fully  trained  active  duty “non-core”  augmentees  may  be  tasked  to  augment,  followed  by  fully-trained  reserve component augmentees.  Unit Type Codes (UTCs) 7FVRQ and 7FVSR are available in the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System to augment geographic AOC PRCCs. 5.  PRCC Training Program. 5.1.  General.  This section prescribes training requirements for PRCC personnel. The AOC weapon  system’s  integrated  systems  approach  to  C2  requires  those  personnel  entrusted  to accomplish  the  PR  mission  be  adequately  trained  and  exercised.  During  major  contingency operations,  the  AFFOR  PRCC  will  most  likely  be  dual-rolled  as  the  JPRC,  requiring  a thorough  understanding  of  both  AFFOR  and  joint  PR  operations  and  capabilities.    AFI  13-1AOC, Volume 1, provides basic AOC training program guidance for core AOC personnel; thus core PRCC personnel will adhere to training and certification program requirements as outlined therein. (T-2)   8  AFI13-208  4 AUGUST 2015 5.2.  PRCC  Training  Program  Overview.  The  goal  of  the  PRCC  training  program  is  to ensure  all  core  PRCC  personnel  (those  identified  on  the  appropriate  geographic  AOC  or ARC-aligned  AOC  UTCs  or  7FVRQ/7FVSR  augmentation  UTCs)  obtain  and  maintain qualification and proficiency needed to effectively coordinate and control PR operations. The PRCC  training  program  is  divided  into  three  areas:  Initial  Qualification  Training  (IQT), Mission Qualification Training (MQT), and Continuation Training (CT).  All assigned core PRCC personnel must attain and maintain Combat Mission Ready (CMR) status in IAW AFI 13-1AOC, Volume 1. (T-2) 5.3.  PRCC  Initial  Qualification  Training.  In accordance with AFI 13-1AOC, Volume 1, completion of an AOC IQT course at the AOC Formal Training Unit (FTU), 505th Training Squadron  (505  TRS),  Hurlburt  Field,  FL,  is  mandatory  for  personnel  assigned  to  the  AOC weapon  system.  (T-2)  Additionally,  certain  PRCC  positions  require  specialized  training taught  by  the  Joint  Personnel  Recovery  Agency  (JPRA)  to  perform  its  PRCC  positional responsibilities.    Table  5.1  lists  mandatory  and  recommended  training  for  each  PRCC position.  If there is a conflict between attending an AOC IQT or a required PR-XXX course, attendance  at  AOC  IQT  takes  precedence.    AOC  IQT  and  JPRA  PR  courses  relevant  to PRCC personnel are listed below.
