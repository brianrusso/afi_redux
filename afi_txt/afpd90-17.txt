Overview:  This Policy Directive: 1.1.  Establishes policy and assigns responsibilities for management of the Air Force energy program. 1.2.  Addresses  activities  and  processes  throughout  the  Air  Force  that  require  energy.  This includes:  infrastructure,  aviation,  ground  vehicle  and  equipment  operations,  as  well  as science  and  technology  initiatives  with  potential  energy  impacts.  These  activities  and processes can occur at enduring and non-enduring locations. 1.3.  Institutes  the  overarching  approach  that  energy  projects  should  enhance  mission assurance  through  energy  assurance,  with  a  focus  on  improving  resiliency,  promoting  cost-competitiveness, and being cleaner than alternatives. 2.  Policy.  The Air Force will: 2.1.  Comply  with  all  higher-level  energy-related  laws  and  policies,  to  include  Executive Orders  and  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  (OSD)  directives  and  instructions,  as appropriate and without impacting mission execution. 2.2.  Implement  DoD  energy  strategies,  policies,  and  operational  energy  certification requirements,  and  budget  for  energy  programs  and  projects  consistent  with  DoD  and  Air Force requirements and priorities. 2.3.  Utilize accepted voluntary consensus and industry standards related to energy and water, unless the standard would result in a potential negative mission impact. 2.4.  Develop and maintain an overall approach to energy management that identifies, plans, and implements improvements in the way the Air Force uses energy within every Air Force functional area. 2.5.  Consider  energy  security  improvements,  efficiencies,  and  capabilities  as  a  factor  in requirements identification and budget development, and provide favorable consideration to projects that improve energy resilience for assets critical to mission accomplishment. 2.6.  Be able to power any infrastructure identified as critical to the performance of mission essential functions independent of the utility grid for the period of time needed to relocate the mission or for at least seven days, whichever is longer. 2.7.  Maximize  the  use  of  energy  efficient  technologies  and  processes  within  Air  Force mission, technical, and financial constraints. 2.8.  Balance  the  objectives  of  Air  Force  energy  projects  to  optimize  cost  and  provide resilient, cleaner sources of energy to enhance mission assurance through energy assurance, with an increased focus on meeting multiple objectives within single projects. AFPD90-17  18 NOVEMBER 2016 3 2.9.  Improve  the  energy  performance  of  weapons  systems,  platforms,  equipment,  and products;  installations,  to  include  both  enduring  and  non-enduring  locations;  and  military forces consistent with statutory, Executive Order, DoD, and Air Force requirements. 2.10.  Develop  and  acquire  equipment  and development processes that improve energy performance or increase energy security. technologies through the  research  and 2.11.  Install and use enterprise-wide energy data collection and management systems on Air Force  installations  to  facilitate  efforts  to  reduce  energy  consumption,  improve  operations, and  achieve  greater  energy  effectiveness  through  energy  consumption  management.

Diversify  energy  supplies  and  sources,  including  renewable  energy  sources  and alternative fuels, across the aviation, facility, and ground vehicle/equipment domains. 2.13.  Leverage alternative financing mechanisms, to include performance contracting tools, to acquire renewable energy and fund energy efficiency projects whenever practical. Pursue such  projects  that  provide  the  Air  Force  with  an  acceptable  rate  of  return,  improve  energy performance,  and/or  contribute  to  increased  energy  security  and  resiliency  for  critical missions. 2.14.  Ensure  any  alternative  fuels  acquired  for  operational  purposes  are  life-cycle  cost-competitive  with  traditional  fuels  and  qualified  as  compatible  with  existing  equipment  and infrastructure. 2.15.  Integrate  energy  considerations,  as  appropriate,  into  all  levels  of  requirements generation:  the  Strategy,  Planning,  and  Programming  Process  (SP3)  process;  acquisition; training; and all phases of operations to ensure energy is recognized as a mission critical need and  that  improvements  in  energy  performance  can  help  increase  combat  capabilities, optimize operations, and improve efficiencies for both installations and weapon systems. 2.16.  Support  the  use  of  energy  analyses  in  Air  Force  requirements,  acquisition,  and  SP3 processes,  including  the  use  of  the  fully  burdened  cost  of  energy  and  the  Energy  Key Performance Parameter (eKPP). 2.17.
