Communicate health risk assessment data to appropriate decision makers/CCs/potentially affected members.    LOCAL REQUIREMENTS: Develop scenario with exercise inputs for CHEMRAT tool.  NOTES:  1.  The default temperature unit of measure is Fahrenheit. This is indicated by a check in the box labeled “Check for Degrees F.” Selected agents have toxicity estimates for Percutaneous Vapor exposure under hot and moderate temperatures. Hot temperatures are defined as greater than 85 degrees F. Moderate temperatures are defined as 65 to 85 degrees F. In general, as the temperature increases, the effective Percutaneous Vapor dosage decreases. CHART will use the temperature input to determine the appropriate toxicity values to calculate and display. 2.  Determining the concentration of a particular chemical warfare agent in the environment is limited by the equipment technologies employed. The default unit of measure is milligrams per cubic meter. If parts per million (ppm) are to be used, indicate by a check in the box labeled “Check for ppm Units.” There are several methods of determining the concentration, to include a measured concentration; a concentration equal to the detection limit of 2    AFQTP 4B051-22                                                                       Journeyman Training Guide:  Response Operations   a particular piece of equipment; and a concentration generated from a CHEMRAT prediction.               3.  CHART is populated with detection limits for various equipment and operating modes. These detection limits are known for the agent selected in Step 1. To use this section, select the Equipment/Method by placing the cursor over the applicable equipment and clicking the left mouse button. The Published Detection Limit for Selected Agent value will appear in the right hand column.  4.  This is the anticipated time for an unprotected airman to accomplish a task that demands a reduction in the MOPP level. The unit of measure is minutes for all inputs. 5.  Select the agent(s) used in the attack. Possible choices are: “GB&GF”, “GD”, “GF”, “HD”, and “VX”. If multiple agents are used, examine each case and result separately. For “GB&GF”, CHEMRAT assumes the tactical ballistic missile (TBM) carries both agents. 6.  Possible chemical choices are: “GB&GF”, “GD”, “GF”, “HD”, and “VX”. If multiple agents are used, examine each case and result separately. For “GB&GF”, CHEMRAT assumes the tactical ballistic missile (TBM) carries both agents. 7.  Number of weapons default = 1 unless you receive specific reports of multiple explosions in same sector.   8.  From this menu, the user can select an area size or a specific air base. This version of CHEMRAT contains two specific air bases, listed as AB1 and AB2, and two generalized base sizes: small and large. A separate Appendix C contains the identification key that ties specific weapon systems to specific air bases. •  Small base = 3 km (downwind) × 1 km (crosswind) •  Large base = 5 km (downwind) × 3 km (crosswind) •  HINT – Always choose “SMALL 9.  The choices are 10 °C (50 °F), 20°C (68 °F), 30 °C (86 °F), and 40 °C (104 °F). If the area temperature falls between two temperature ranges, evaluate both temperatures and compare the results. Select the temperature that presents the worst-case results. Select the wind speed closest to forecast or actual conditions. If the current wind speed falls between two wind speed ranges, evaluate both wind speeds and compare the results. Select the wind speed that presents the worst-case results.  Wind Speed and Stability Categories Wind Speed           Stability Category 1 m/s (3.6 km/h)           F (Stable) 3 m/s (10.8 km/h)             D or F 5 m/s (18.0 km/h)         D (Neutral)  10.  This represents the concentration in the grid receiving the most contamination.  Use 99 and 95 if you have the time, but if the results are more than 10x lower than peak, use peak for all VLS-Track plume area.  (ref pp 19-20 of policy ltr and p 17 of CHEMRAT guidance for background). 11.  For subsequent attacks, consider lengthening exposure time to estimate total length of exposure (if people will be in both places).   Or, if performing risk assessment for a particular task, enter the expected duration of that task (for example, sortie generation will take 2 hours). 12.  To estimate inhaled exposure risk if MOPP reduced to MOPP 0-2, select “Inhaled” and “None.”  To estimate percutaneous risk, select “PercVapor” and “None.”  For G series agents, the percutaneous vapor penetration is relatively low (90% inhalations vs. 10% dermal).  VX, however, is 50% inhaled and 50% dermal. 13.
