Scope. This handbook is not intended to be an all inclusive step-by-step manual,  but  rather  a  document  that  will  inspire  additional  thought  during pavement  milling  operations.  This  handbook  contains  tactics,  techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for use by civil engineers in supporting precepts out-lined  in  Air  Force  Doctrine  Document  (AFDD)  4-0,  Combat  Support,  and published  guidance  related  to  Engineer  Operations.  It  also  supports  imple-mentation  of  Air  Force  Policy  Directive  (AFPD)  10-2,  Readiness,  and  AFI 10-209,  RED  HORSE  Program.  This  relationship  is  illustrated  in  Figure 1.1., the Air Force CE hierarchy of publications. 1.2. Overview. Worn, deteriorated roads with potholes, severe cracking, and heavy  rutting  that  traps  water  and  causes  hydroplaning  and  slick  surfaces (polished  aggregate)  with  reduced  skid  resistance  often  require  immediate attention  in  the  form  of  overlaying  with  new  pavement.  Before  an  existing pavement  is  overlaid  with  new  pavement  the  surface  must  be  prepared. Overlaid  pavements  constructed  without  adequate  surface  preparation  may not  meet  smoothness  specifications,  or  may  not  bond  to  the  existing  pave-ment. 1.2.1. The  existing  pavement  should  be  made  as  smooth  as  possible  before being overlaid. It is difficult to make up elevation differences or smooth out ruts by varying overlay thickness. Hot mix asphalt (HMA) tends to differen-tially  compact;  a  rule  of  thumb  is  that  conventional  mixes  will  initially compact  approximately  0.25  inches  per  1  inch  of  thickness.  Thus,  thicker pavements  will  compact  more.  Therefore,  before  applying  the  final  surface course  the  existing  pavement  is  typically  leveled  by  either  applying  a  leve-ling course or milling (also called grinding or cold planning). 1.2.2. For many situations, milling may be a superior alternative to a leveling course.  Leveling  course  quantities  are  difficult  to  accurately  estimate  and leveling  course  thicknesses  are  usually  small,  precluding  the  use  of  nuclear gauge density testing. Thus, adequate mix density is difficult to achieve and measure.     AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    7 Figure 1.1. Air Force Civil Engineer Publications Hierarchy. 1.2.3. Milling is an economical tool for removing failed pavement  allowing new overlays  to last longer, ride smoother and perform better. Existing sur-face  mix  buildup  is  mechanically  removed  which  minimizes  the  possibility     AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    8 of  rutting  and  provides  a  better  bonding  surface  for  new  paving  material, thus extending the life of the surface. By removing old layers of pavement to a  desired  depth  using  specialized  equipment,  the  surface  is  restored  free  of bumps, ruts, wash-boarding and other cross-sectional imperfections. In addi-tion, surface cracks and brittle oxidized asphalt surface materials can be re-moved  by  milling,  which  will  lessen  the  potential  for  reflective  crack  ap-pearance  in  the  overlay.  The finished  texture  surface  will  immediately  sup-port traffic while awaiting the final overlay. Milling also saves on the need to adjust inlet  grates and replace curbs and  gutters. By  keeping the  full height of the original curbing the drainage capacity in the gutter pan is  maintained which  precludes  the  potential  spread  of  storm-water  runoff  into  the  travel-way. 1.3. Cold Milling. The milling process, which does not use heat, is used to mill a bituminous or Portland cement concrete pavement to a desired depth. Since no heat is needed, the pollution problem caused by burning bitumen is eliminated. However, a problem  with dust  may occur, but  this problem can usually be solved by spraying a small amount of water onto the pavement in front of the machine.  1.3.1.  Milling  also  produces  a  rough,  grooved  surface,  which  will  increase the  existing  pavement’s  surface  area  when  compared  to  an  ungrooved  sur-face. The surface area increase is dependent on the type, number, condition and  spacing  of  cutting  drum  teeth  but  is  typically  in  the  range  of  20  to  30 percent, which requires a corresponding increase in tack coat (20 to 30 per-cent more) when compared to an unmilled surface (Figure 1.2.).  Figure 1.2. Milled Surface with Tack Coat Applied.     AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    9 1.3.2. Table 1.1. identifies the advantages and disadvantages of cold milling. Table 1.1. Cold Milling Advantages and Disadvantages. Advantages Disadvantages Improves ride-ability of pavement Possible foreign object damage (FOD) problem Can be used with asphalt concrete and Portland cement concrete pavements Should be used only on structurally sound pavement Provides a skid resistant surface suita-ble for temporary road surface until overlay is applied  Reduces the depth of embedment of reinforcing fabrics and grid and/or damages them Improves skid resistance of overlay Minimizes traffic disruption Provides reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) for recycling operations Efficiently removes deteriorated pavement unsuitable for retention on overlaid pavement Allows curb and gutter lines to be maintained or reestablished before HMA overlays Maintains clearances for bridge struc-tures, traffic signals, and overhead utilities       1.4. Milling Machines. Milling machines are the primary method for remov-ing old HMA pavement surface material prior to overlay (Figure 1.3.). The milling equipment, which can remove up to 4 inches of bituminous mixture in one pass, uses sensors that follow a string-line grade reference and slope control  to  directly  control  the  finished  grade.  The  milling  machine  can  be used during all weather conditions to produce a smoother grade.     AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011 Figure 1.3. Milling Machine in Action.    10  1.5.  Cutting  Teeth.  The  cutting  teeth  on  the  milling  machine  are  a  high maintenance  item  and  must  be  replaced  often  (Figure  1.4.).  The  teeth  may last one or two days, depending on hardness of the material being milled and the number of operation hours per day. Check the length of the teeth periodi-cally during the day and replace when necessary.  Figure 1.4. Cutting Teeth. 1.6. Milling  versus  Heater-Planing.  The  reasons  for  milling  are  similar  to those  for  heater-planing.  The  milling  can  remove  bituminous  or  Portland cement  concrete  pavement  from  bridges  to  avoid  exceeding  the  maximum dead load. Also, areas adjacent to curbs, manholes, and other structures can be  milled  before  an  overlay  is  applied  so  that  the  overlay  thickness  can  be     AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    11 maintained adjacent to these structures. One advantage the pavement milling machine has over the  heater-planer is its ability to remove  Portland cement concrete  pavement.  This  is  particularly  advantageous  when  milling  a  pave-ment that has some Portland cement concrete along with the bituminous ma-terial that must be planed or removed, such as in areas adjacent to manholes or  patches.  The  most  extensive  use  of  the  milling  machine  is  in  pavement recycling. The removed materials can be mixed with new aggregate and new asphalt, per engineer’s mix design, to produce recycled cold mix or recycled hot mix.  1.7.  Milled  Surface.  Occasionally,  when  a  pavement  surface  has  been milled, the surface is used as the riding surface for a period of time. For in-stance, when a pavement does not have adequate skid resistance but no im-mediate  funds  are  available  to  overlay  this  pavement,  one  alternative  is  to mill  the  surface  to  give  it  a  rough  surface  texture  and  thereby  provide  ade-quate skid resistance until it can be overlaid or otherwise repaired. An exces-sive amount of material should not be removed because the pavement struc-ture would be weakened. Raveling may become a problem with asphalt con-crete pavements after the milling process; for that reason it is recommended that  the  pavement  be  overlaid  as  soon  after  the  milling  as  possible.  On  air-fields,  raveling  could  result  in  FOD  to  the  aircraft.  Therefore,  an  overlay should be applied immediately after the milling operation is completed. 1.8. Milled Material. The material obtained from milling operations can be used  in  pavement  construction.  The  milled  material  can  be  stockpiled,  but care must be exercised not to stockpile it too high, especially in hot weather, since the asphalt concrete material will have a tendency to bond thus making it difficult to  use. In  most cases, the  material should not be stockpiled over 10  feet.  The  milled  material  can  be  used  for  producing  recycled  cold  mix, recycled hot mix, and other mixes. Materials milled from different pavement sections  should  be  stored  in  separate  homogeneous  stockpiles  rather  than conglomerate stockpiles. Homogeneous RAP sources are more consistent in terms  of  asphalt  binder  and  aggregate  type  and  properties,  and  will  lead  to improved consistency in mixture design and a better finished product. Milled materials  should  be  fractionated  (separated/sieved)  when  used  in  RAP  to ensure proper mix design and production control.    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    12 1.8.1.  Occasionally,  this  milled  material  can  be  used  to  surface  secondary roads that otherwise would not be surfaced (Figure 1.5.). In this case some additional binder material, such as asphalt emulsion or rejuvenator, is added to  rejuvenate  the  old  asphalt  or  improve  binding  qualities.  This  milled  ma-terial,  mixed  with  asphalt  emulsion,  can  also  be  used  as  a  base  course  for high-quality pavements. The material can be mixed in place or removed and plant-mixed  to  produce  a  satisfactory  base  course.  For  high-quality  airfield pavements, this base course should be overlaid with the minimum amount of asphalt concrete mixture required by design.  Figure 1.5. Secondary Road Surfaced with Recycled Asphalt.  1.8.2. The gradation of the milled material obtained from the milling opera-tion is important when the material is to be used to produce recycled cold or hot mixes.  1.8.2.1. When the material is to be used in recycled cold mix, the maximum size  of  the  milled  material,  which  is  a  conglomeration  of  aggregate  and  as-phalt,  should  not  exceed  1.5  inches.  However,  a  small  amount  of  material larger than 1.5 inches is acceptable if it can be removed by screening prior to mixing. Generally, the milled material, without additional virgin aggregates, is used to produce recycled cold mix.     AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    13 1.8.2.2. When the milled material is to be used in recycled hot mix, the gra-dation of the milled material after extraction of the asphalt cement is impor-tant. Very little breakdown of the aggregate should occur during the milling operation.  It  is  important  that  the  maximum  size  of  the  material  as  milled does not exceed 1.5 to 2 inches to ensure that it will break up and satisfacto-rily mix with the new materials in the production of recycled hot mix.  1.8.2.3. Some filler material passing the No.200 sieve will be manufactured during the milling operation. Depending on the aggregate type, 1 to 3 percent additional  filler  may  be  manufactured.  One  of  the  problems  in  designing  a recycled  mixture  is  not  to  exceed  the  maximum  amount  of  filler  allowed. Generally, new aggregates that are to be added to a recycled mixture are re-quired to have little or no filler. Therefore, washing of new aggregate is of-ten required to remove the filler prior to producing the recycled mixture.  1.9.  Base  Course.  When  the  asphalt  pavement  material  is  to  be  removed down to the base course, care should be taken to prevent damage to the base course. Any damage to the base course should  be corrected prior to placing the  recycled  mixture.  Generally,  approximately  0.5  inch  of  asphalt  mixture should be left in place to prevent damage to the base course by the  milling equipment or by rain.  1.10. Reinforcing Fabric. When a paving fabric or grid is known to exist in the underlying pavement structure that is being milled, either leave the fabric or grid in place and mill no closer to the fabric or grid than a distance equal to the top size of the in place aggregate (typically .5 to .75 inches),  or com-pletely remove the fabric or grid. In the latter case, the type of fabric or grid used will be important, as many of the existing textiles and steel netting rein-forcement layers will pose problems to the milling operation. In some cases, reversing  the  normal  rotational  direction  of  the  drum  will  lead  to  improved results.  The  manufacturer  of  the  reinforcement  or  grid  product,  if  known, should be consulted prior to milling.          AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    14 Chapter 2 MILLING MACHINE SPECIFICATIONS  2.1.  Machine  Description.  RED  HORSE  units  use  the  Roadtec®  RX-60C machine  (Figure  2.1.)  for  their  milling  operations  (at  the  time  of  this  writ-ing). This is a reliable and quality milling machine designed for ease of op-eration  and  service.  The  RX-60C  mills  and  planes  any  pavement  material with various cutting widths, using a bolt-in cutter housing. The diesel engine powers a variable width belt-driven cutter that cuts up to 12 inches deep. The cutter loads  material onto a 42-inch  wide primary conveyor which transfers to  a  42-inch  wide  secondary  conveyor  capable  of  pivoting  50  degrees  left and right of center. Figure 2.1. Roadtec® RX-60C Milling Machine.  2.2. Machine Features. 2.2.1. Engine. The RX-60C has a diesel engine equipped with an emergency shutdown system.  2.2.2. Drive System. The machine has a mechanical V-belt drive to the cut-ter  drum  planetary  gearbox.  It  has  a  hydrostatic  drive  propulsion  and  con-veyor system. 2.2.3. Suspension. The three-point suspension system has hydraulic cylind-ers inside each leg tube that adjusts by electric control on the console or au-   AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    15 tomatically by the use of grade controls (see paragraphs 2.2.7. and 2.2.10.2. below). 2.2.4. Steering. The machine has a 10-foot 3-inch turning radius with three track  steering  or  34-foot  4-inch  turning  radius  with  two  track  steering.  An automatic rear-centering device aligns the rear track and a red pointer indi-cates  the  rear  position.  All  three  tracks  steering  provides  crab  steering  with coordinated steering system. 2.2.5. Water. Spray bars located on the front and back of the cutter housing and on both primary and secondary conveyors provide cooling  water to the cutter  drum.  Water  is  provided  for  wash-down  by  use  of  the  wash-down hose. The wash-down hose is stored on the hose reel at the front of the ma-chine. 2.2.6.  Conveyor.  The  conveyors  are  two-piece  front  discharge  type  with  a 42-inch  wide  pick-up  (primary)  and  42-inch  load-out  (secondary)  conveyor with  endless  cleated  belts.  The  load-out  conveyor  swings  50-degrees  to  ei-ther side. 2.2.7.  Grade  Controls.  Grade  controls  can  be  adjusted  manually  from  the console, or the grade control systems on each side of the machine can auto-matically  maintain  the  desired  depth  of  cut  to  12-inches.  A  valve  on  either side allows the grade controls to be activated from ground level. 2.2.8. Cutter Drum. Cutter drums have multiple cutting widths with a bolt-in cutter housing (Figure 2.2.). Drums come in widths of 7-foot 2-inches, 8-foot 2-inches, 10-foot, and 12-foot 6-inches. The 46-inch tip-to-tip diameter quick change tooth cutter drum rotates at 94.7 revolutions per minute (RPM) at full throttle. The cutter drum is turned by a belt-driven planetary gearbox. 2.2.9. Safety Features. The control panel and electronic instrumentation has been  designed  for  simplicity,  yet  provides  adequate  and  visually  displayed information  for  the  operator  to  be  continually  aware  of  machine  operation and system conditions. 2.2.9.1. The engine will start only when prestart conditions are met.      AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011 Figure 2.2. Cutter Drum.    16 2.2.9.2. The engine will not start with the machine in an unsafe condition. 2.2.9.3. The engine will not run when water overheats or oil pressure is low. 2.2.9.4. The cutter drum stops when a hard, unmillable object is encountered. This will cause the machine to jump upwards and backwards and can be very hazardous to the ground crew.  2.2.10.

The power plant of the RX-60C milling machine is the Cater-pillar 3412E diesel (Figure 2.7.). It is an 1150 cubic inch turbocharger and after-cooled  diesel  that  develops  900  hp  at  2,100  RPM.  The  RX-60C  may also be equipped with either a Cummins 800 hp QSK engine or the Caterpil-lar 860 hp C-16 engine. Figure 2.7. Caterpillar 3412E Diesel Engine.     AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    23 2.6.1.1. The turbocharger uses exhaust gas energy to pack more air into the cylinders for efficient combustion, improved fuel consumption, and reduced heat. The turbocharger also compensates to maintain combustion air density for operating at higher altitudes. The engine will deliver full rated power to 8,500 feet above sea level. 2.6.1.2.  The  after-cooler  cools  the  pressurized  intake  air  from  the  turbo-charger permitting greater air density and more complete combustion of fuel. 2.6.1.3.  The  engine  is  equipped  with  an  electronic  control  module  (ECM) that is connected to many sensors on the engine. These sensors provide vital information  to  the  ECM  for  proper  monitoring  of  engine  functions.  High coolant  temperature  or  low  oil  pressure  will  activate  sensors  that  open  the circuit to the fuel injector solenoid, shutting off fuel supply to the engine. 2.6.1.4. The engine data plate shows the engine’s serial number (ESN), con-trol  parts  list  (CPL),  model,  and  the  horsepower  and  RPM  rating.  This  in-formation is used when ordering parts and for service needs. The engine data plate  must not be changed  unless approved by Ca-terpillar Engine Company, Inc. NOTE!  2.6.1.5. Fuel. Always use reputable grade of diesel fuel that has sulfur con-tent below 0.5%; higher sulfur contents affect oil change intervals. Observe strict cleanliness when filling tank. At low ambient temperatures, use winter-grade  fuel  only.  The  fuel  must  be  replenished  promptly  to  prevent  the  tank from  running  dry,  otherwise  fuel  filter  and  injection  lines  will  need  air-venting. 2.6.2.  Electrical System. Two 12-volt batteries connected  in series provide for  a  24  volt  electrical  system.  The  batteries  are  the  center  of  the  electrical system and proper care will ensure trouble-free operation. A 60 amp, 24 volt alternator provides current to maintain battery charge and provides power to operate  the  electrical  system.  See  Figure  2.8.  to  locate  electrical  compo-nents.      AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    24 Figure 2.8. Electrical Component Locations.  2.6.3. Hydraulic Systems. The RX-60C is comprised of five engine driven hydraulic pumps that include the main drive pump, primary conveyor pump, secondary  conveyor  pump,  auxiliary  pump,  and  the  radiator  fan  pump.  All but  the  radiator  fan  pump  can  be  monitored  from  the  operators  console  in-strument  panel.  These  pumps  supply  power  to  the  following  11  different hydraulic circuits: 1) drive, 2) clutch, 3) steering, 4) leg tube and grade con-trol, 5) conveyor, 6) brake, 7) hood raise, 8) moldboard raise, 9) belt tension-ing, 10) spray bar/wash-down, and 11) fan motor (see manufacturer’s Opera-tion, Service, & Maintenance Manual for hydraulic circuits diagrams). These 11 hydraulic circuits are supplied hydraulic oil from a 100-gallon hydraulic reservoir. This reservoir can be resupplied directly by the hand pump, which is part of the auxiliary hydraulic oil tank. NOTE! It is recommended to fill the hydraulic tank with 90 gallons; if filled to  100  gallons  hydraulic  oil  will  overflow  due  to  fluid  expansion from heat     AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    25 2.7.

Do  not  wait  until  it  is  time  to  conduct  actual  milling  opera-tions in the field. See the manufacturer’s Operation, Service & Main-tenance manual for full description and component location.  3.3. Starting the Engine. Follow the instructions below  for engine  starting procedures.   3.3.1. Place the throttle control at low idle. 3.3.2. Place travel control in neutral and conveyor selector switch to off. 3.3.3. Disengage clutch knob down. Apply brake knob down. 3.3.4. Left and right grade sensors should be off. Moldboard should be in the down position. NOTE! Neutral safety switches  will prevent the engine from  starting unless the travel in neutral, conveyors off, clutch off and moldboard in the down position.  3.3.5.  Push  the  ignition  switch  down  and  right  to  ―start.‖  Once  the  engine starts and the light goes out allow the switch to return to the ―on‖ position.    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    28 NOTE! For  cold  weather  start-up,  refer  to  the  specifications  section  in  the specific  engine  manufacturer’s  handbook  before  leaving  home  sta-tion.  Do  not  wait  until  it  becomes  cold  and  on  the  job  site  before learning this procedure.   3.4.  Machine  Operation.  Perform  the  following  steps  to  operate  the  ma-chine. Run  conveyors  for  no  more  than  30  seconds  without  water  spray. The primary belt beneath the machine gets very hot. CAUTION!  3.4.1. After the engine has  warmed for 15 to 20 minutes (allow 30  minutes when  ambient  temperature  is  colder  than  30  degrees  Fahrenheit),  start  the conveyor belts at low idle by selecting forward on the conveyor switch in the center,  top  portion  of  the  operator’s  console.  Descend  from  the  operator’s platform  and  listen  for  noisy  bearings.  Replace  any  noisy  bearings  before starting milling operations. 3.4.2.  Return  to  the  operator’s  platform  and  increase  throttle  to  full  speed and check the following controls and pressures:  3.4.2.1. Tachometer at 2,100 RPM. 3.4.2.2. Auxiliary system pressure at 2,700 pounds per square inch (PSI). 3.4.2.3. Clutch pressure at 0 PSI. 3.4.2.4. Feed conveyor pressure at 300 PSI. 3.4.2.5. Discharge conveyor pressure at 300 PSI. 3.4.2.6. Travel pressure at 300 PSI. 3.4.3. Position the machine at the beginning of the cut. It may be best to start cutting  a  few  feet  into  the  cut  zone  to  prevent  the  possibility  of  cutting    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    29 pavement before the starting point. The area left can be trimmed later on the clean up cuts. 3.4.4. Zero out the grade control sensors. NOTE! Grade  control  function  can  be  controlled  by  either  endgate  attach-ment  (Figure  3.1.)  or  caster  attachment  (Figure  3.2.).  Caster  at-tachment is recommended in situations of uneven or irregular grade.  Figure 3.1. Endgate Attachment.   Figure 3.2. Caster Attachment.    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    30 3.4.4.1. Lower the rear of the machine using the rear elevation controls to the proper cutting depth (Figure 3.3.). Figure 3.3. Rear of Machine Lowered. 3.4.4.2. Lower the front of the machine using the left and  right  front eleva-tion controls simultaneously until the toe of the endgate touches the ground. If caster attachment is to be used at the point, lower caster assembly (Figure 3.4.) until wheel touches grade at the same level as endgate toe. Figure 3.4. Endgate and Caster Assembly.      AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    31 3.4.4.3. Turn the right sensor valve on the control panel to the ―on‖ position. Turn  the  right  ground  sensor  valve  on.  Crank  the  depth  indicator  (Figure 3.5.) to ―0‖ on the scale. Figure 3.5. Depth Indicator Scale. 3.4.4.4. Loosen the  nut on the linkage,  which  secures  the  arm to the sensor shaft (Figure 3.6.). Figure 3.6. Location of Sensor Arm Locking Nut.      AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    32 3.4.4.5.  Using  a  screwdriver,  rotate  the  sensor  shaft  slowly  until  the  cutter drum teeth just make contact with the ground. Re-tighten the locking nut to secure the arm to the sensor shaft. 3.4.4.6. Rotate depth indicator crank again to check the response of the sen-sor. If response is incorrect (correct response is: crank up and the cutter drum moves up  – crank down and  the cutter drum  moves down), loosen the lock nut  on  the  sensor  shaft  and  with  the  screwdriver  rotate  the  sensor  shaft  45 degrees, then tighten and repeat this check. The sensor is now null or zero. 3.4.4.7. Repeat this procedure on the left sensor. 3.4.4.8.  When  both  sensors  have  been  nulled  and  zeroed,  turn  both  sensor valves to the ―off‖ position. Using the front elevation controls, raise the front of  the  machine  until  the  cutter  drum  is  approximately  six  inches  off  the ground. 3.4.5. Return engine speed to low idle by moving throttle control to ―low.‖ Engage the clutch at  low engine idle only! Failure to do so  will re-sult in premature clutch failure. CAUTION!  3.4.6. Engage the clutch by placing the clutch control switch in the ―up‖ po-sition. Clutch pressure should be 500 PSI. Clutch pressure can be adjusted by turning  the  pressure  reducing  valve  (Figure  3.7.)  located  on  the  left  hand side of the valve bank in front of the control panel. Allow 10 more minutes for the planetary drive and clutch to warm up. 3.4.7.  Increase  engine  speed  to  full  throttle  (2,100  RPM)  by  moving  the throttle control to ―high.‖ 3.4.8. Open the valve between the water tank and pump (Figure 3.8.). Open the valve between the pump and spray bars (Figure 3.9. and 3.10.). 3.4.9. Turn water pump on using the control panel water control switch. 3.4.10. Start the conveyors by selecting forward on the conveyor switch and turning the conveyor speed control clockwise to the desired speed.    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    33 Figure 3.7.

Primary and Secondary Conveyor Spray Bars.   3.4.11. Turn the left and right sensor controls located on the control panel to the ―on‖ position and turn both ground controls on (Figure 3.11.).      AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011 Figure 3.11. Ground Control Location.    35  3.4.12. Crank the grade control depth indicator to read the required depth of the cut on each side of the machine. Machine will slowly lower itself into the cut. 3.4.13. Lower the moldboard by pushing the moldboard toggle switch on the control panel ―down.‖ Moldboard down pressure can be adjusted by turning the pressure reducing valve located underneath the left hand side of the con-trol panel. The normal operating pressure of the moldboard pressure valve is 150 PSI (Figure 3.12.). Figure 3.12. Rear Moldboard Pressure Reducing Valve Location.     AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    36 3.4.14. Release the brake by pushing control panel switch upward. 3.4.15. Place the travel control valve in the slow range. Ease the travel speed joystick  slowly  forward  starting  the  cutting  process  very  slowly  (approx-imately  10-15  feet  per  minute)  until  the  rear  leg  gets  into  the  cut.  At  this point, the travel rate can be increased to the desired speed, typically around 50 feet per minute based on a 2 inch cutting depth in asphalt. Do not attempt to cut concrete at this speed. 3.4.16. On the second and subsequent passes, the grade controls on the side of the machine that is next to the cut previously made will have  to be set at zero. Leaving controls set at 2 inches will result in cutting another 2 inches. 3.4.17. Constantly monitor all gauges during operation. Pay particular atten-tion to the following: 3.4.17.1.  Track  Pressure.  This  gauge  identifies  how  hard  the  machine  is pushing against the cut. Keep this pressure under 4,000 PSI.  CAUTION! If  the  conveyor  belts  stop  from  overpressure  (~4,000  PSI),  shut  off conveyors immediately! Failure to do so may result in a pressure line rupturing or damage to the hydraulic motor.  3.4.17.2.  Primary  and  Secondary  Conveyor  Belt  Pressures.  When  the conveyor belts become overloaded, they  will stop rotating  at approximately 4,000  PSI.  Decreasing  the  angle  of  the  secondary  conveyor  may  allow  the belt to start rotating again. If that does not work, remove some material from the  conveyor  with  a  shovel  until  the  conveyor  starts  rotating  again.  When milling operations resume, slow down the rate of cut. 3.4.18. Sometimes the moldboard will hang up when trying to get down into the  cut.  If  the  machine  fails  to  proceed  when  easing  into  a  cut,  check  the track pressure gauge. If the pressure is very high, bump the rear moldboard switch up and put it right back down again. If that fails to work, ensure the range  selector  is  in  the  slow  setting.  If  not,  return  the  travel  lever  to  the ―stop‖  position  before  changing  the  setting  to  the  slow  setting  and  then  re-turn the travel lever to the ―on‖ position.    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011 3.5. Stopping and Shutdown.     37 3.5.1. To stop machine travel, return  the travel control joystick to the ―neu-tral‖ position. 3.5.2. Apply the brake. 3.5.3. Turn water pump off. 3.5.4. Turn both the left and right sensor valves to the ―off‖ position. 3.5.5.  Raise  the  front  and  rear  elevation  of  the  machine  using  the  electric toggle switches. 3.5.6. Place the throttle control in the low idle position and permit the engine to idle for a short period to cool down. 3.5.7. Disengage the clutch by flipping the toggle switch down. 3.5.8. Return the conveyor selector control to ―off.‖ 3.5.9. Raise the moldboard by pushing the moldboard toggle switch up. 3.5.10. Close the water valve between the pump and spray bars. 3.5.11. Turn the ignition switch to ―off.‖ 3.6.  Interchangeable  Cutter  Housing  Procedure.  The  RX-60C  gives  the user  the  option  of  several  different  cutting  widths  ranging  from  7  foot-2 inches to 12 foot-6inches. This application requires a removable cutter hous-ing, which can be exchanged from under the machine to facilitate the desired width. The following is a visual overview illustrating the changeability of the RX-60C cutter housings. WARNING! Always shut off the engine, raise the moldboard with the power pack and  set  the  safety  bars  when  working  on  the  cutter  drum,  conveyor or otherwise servicing the machine.  3.6.1. Endgate Removal. Perform the following procedures only if replace-ment cutter-housing is equipped with endgates.     AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    38 3.6.1.1.  Disassemble  and  remove  the  ladders,  endgate  jacks,  cylinders  and the endgates; be careful to note the direction of fittings on cylinders and mi-cro torque valve (Figure 3.13.). Figure 3.13. Remove These Items for Endgate Removal. 3.6.1.2.  Before  removing  the  endgate  bolt  (Figure  3.14.),  nut,  and  washer, support  the  endgate  assembly  safely.  Remove  the  endgates  even  if  replace-ment cutter housing is equipped with endgates. Figure 3.14. Endgate Bolt Location.      AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    39 3.6.2.  Cutter  Belt  Removal.  Begin  by  removing  the  belt-guard  housing doors and panels to gain access to the belt tension cylinder and pulley. Remove  all  personnel  from  under  machine  before  releasing  cutter belt tension. WARNING!  or otherwise servicing the machine. 3.6.2.1. Observing the caution above, release cutter belt tension (engine  will have to be started to do so).  3.6.2.2. Remove cutter belts, belt tension cylinder, and the belt tension pul-ley assembly (Figure 3.15.) being sure hydraulic hoses are placed in a safe position  as  to  not  be  pinched  or  crushed  when  removing  or  inserting  cutter housing.  Figure 3.15. Belt tension Cylinder and Pulley Location.  3.6.2.3.  Always  apply  anti-seize  compound  and  some  form  of  wrapping  to the belt tension pulley shaft. This prevents rust and problems later. 3.6.3. Front and Rear Moldboard Cylinders. Remove the cylinder pins from the cylinders on front and rear moldboards. With all personnel removed from under the machine, carefully retract cylinders to keep them from interfering with the cutter housing removal (Figure 3.16.).    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    40 Figure 3.16. Removing Rear Moldboard Cylinder.  3.6.4. Primary Conveyor Pins.  3.6.4.1.  Using  floor  jacks  or  some  type  of  lifting  equipment,  suspend  the primary  conveyor  properly  using  the  side  hooks  and  chains  (Figure  3.17.). Use caution to ensure the chains are secured tightly. Figure 3.17. Primary Conveyor Suspended with Side Hooks and Chains. 3.6.4.2. Once the conveyor is secured, remove conveyor pins from the con-veyor mounts on the front moldboard (Figure 3.18.).     AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    41 Figure 3.18.

Housing Bolts and Housing Ski.  WARNING! Ensure all personnel, other than the operator, are a safe distance (no less than five feet) from the machine.  3.6.6.1. Using elevation switches, raise the machine so that the cutter hous-ing ski (provided) can be placed under the cutter housing (Figure 3.22.).    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    43 Figure 3.22. Placing Cutter Housing Ski Under Cutter Housing.  3.6.6.2. Once the ski is in position, safely lower the machine allowing the ski to line up directly under the cutter housing. Securely bolt the ski to the cutter housing, four bolts per side. 3.6.6.3.  With  the  ski  bolted  into  place,  safely  raise  the  machine  and  ski  to allow any type of roller to be placed under the ski. Figure 3.23. shows solid metal bars. The rollers allow the cutter housing and ski to be removed more easily. Figure 3.23. Cutter Housing and Ski Removed Using Rollers. 3.6.6.4.  Once  the  bars  are  placed,  safely  lower  machine,  this  allows  the weight of the cutter housing to be supported on the ground. Remove the cut-ter housing bolts, four per side (Figure 3.24.).     AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    44 Figure 3.24. Removing Cutter Housing Bolt.  3.6.7. Removing the Cutter Housing. Some type of vehicle will have to be used to pull the cutter housing from under the machine. Slowly and carefully (being aware of personnel  in  the area) pull the cutter  housing from the belt guard side of the machine. The machine will have to be raised and lowered during  the  process  (to  clear  the  primary  conveyor  and  the  moldboards)  at different points in the path of the housing as it is pulled from under the ma-chine. 3.6.8.  Replacing  the  Cutter  Housing.  Reverse  the  procedures  in  para-graphs  3.6.6.  through  3.6.7.  to  insert  new  cutter  housing.  There  are  a  few changes  in the installment process if the  new cutter housing is a  wider ver-sion. These changes will be discussed starting with paragraph 3.6.9. 3.6.9. Wider Cutter Housings.  3.6.9.1.  Once  the  new  cutter  housing  is  in  place  under  the  machine  and bolted  in  using  cutter  housing  bolts,  reconnect  the  primary  conveyor  (this may  also  require  some  maneuvering  of  the  machine  to  line  up  the  flashing and conveyor pins). Unbolt the ski and safely raise the machine and remove the ski. 3.6.9.2. The wider cutter housing is provided  with different ladders and ex-tensions for the drive shaft and protection covers. A drive shaft extension is provided and must be tightly bolted to the end of the  power take-off (PTO) clutch (Figure 3.25.).    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    45 Figure 3.25. Preparing to Bolt Drive Shaft Extension to PTO Clutch.  3.6.9.3. Install brace and drive shaft protective covers. 3.6.9.4. Once the braces and covers are in place, reassemble the belt tension system and belt guard, moldboard cylinders, spray bar connections, endgates and cylinders, endgate jacks, and microtorque valves. Then attach the diffe-rently styled ladder provided. 3.7. Ground Level Controls. The machine may have optional ground level controls  that  may  be  operated  from  ground  level  (Figure  3.26.).  They  per-form  the  same  functions  as  their  identical  controls  found  on  the  operator’s console panel. Figure 3.26. Ground Level Controls.     AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    46 3.8. Power Pack. In the event of engine or machine failure, the power pack system  can  be  used  to  release  the  brake  system  and  operate  other  auxiliary functions. The procedure for releasing the brake is a one-man operation and is performed as follows: 3.8.1. Place moldboard toggle switch in the center position. Then, open the valve  hood  just  in  front  of  the  instrument  console  and  make  sure  the  high pressure wash-down valve is turned ―on‖ (12 o’clock position). 3.8.2. Locate the on/off valve on the left pressure manifold. Turn the valve to the ―on‖ position (Figure 3.27.). Figure 3.27. Location of On/Off Valve on Left Pressure Manifold.  3.8.3. Open the left door and locate the remote power pack toggle switch on the  center  post.  This  switch  allows  the  operator  to  pressurize  the  system while watching the gauge for full gauge pressure (Figure 3.28.). 3.8.4. Open the right door and locate the brake on/off valve under the opera-tor’s  console.  Disconnect  the  quick-disconnect  brake  line  from  the  brake on/off valve.      AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    47 Figure 3.28. Location of Power Pack Switch. 3.8.5. Connect the brake line to the male quick-disconnect fitting on the right pressure manifold (Figure 3.29.). Figure 3.29. Location of Quick-Disconnect on Right Pressure Manifold.  3.8.6. Turn the power pack on by moving the toggle switch and watch for a rise  in  pressure  on  the  gauge.  Upon  reaching  maximum  pressure,  turn  the     AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    48 brake  on/off  valve  (Figure  3.27.)  to  the  ―off‖  position.  The  brakes  will  be disengaged. 3.8.7. Continue holding the switch and the pressure will begin to rise on the power  pack  pressure  gauge.  While  holding  the  power  pack  switch,  operate any function to lift the machine out of the cut or move the conveyors to any position. CAUTION! Operate  the  power  pack  continuously  for  a  maximum  of  one minute.  After  every  minute  of  continuous  power  pack  operation,  a minimum of four  minutes cooling  must  be allowed! The ignition switch must be on! 3.8.8. Make all necessary engine or machine repairs.   3.8.9.  Disconnect  the  brake  female  quick-disconnect  fitting  from  the  power pack male quick-disconnect fitting under the instrument panel. 3.8.10.  Re-connect  the  brake  female  quick-disconnect  fitting  to  the  brake male quick disconnect-fitting under the instrument panel. 3.9. High Pressure Wash-down. Removal of asphalt and concrete from the machine is accomplished by utilizing the machine’s high pressure system. A daily routine of machine wash-down should be completed at the end of each milling  day  and  prior  to  any  greasing.  A  daily  routine  of  machine  wash-down increases the reliability and safety of your machine in addition to pro-viding pride in its appearance. 3.9.1. The high pressure wash-down hose can be accessed from the hose reel, which is located on the left hand side of the front of the machine. The high pressure wash-down wand is located in the toolbox. The high pressure wash-down system is activated from the wash-down lever located under the opera-tor’s console (Figure 3.30.).       AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    49 Figure 3.30. Location of Wash-down Lever. 3.9.2. The steps to activate the wash-down system are as follows: 3.9.2.1.  Select  a  suitable  location  where  wash-down  water  will  not  affect milling operation.  3.9.2.2. Verify that the parking brake is on. 3.9.2.3. Start the engine. 3.9.2.4. Open the toolbox and remove the wash-down wand. 3.9.2.5. Unwind the hose from the hose reel. 3.9.2.6. Connect wash-down wand to hose. 3.9.2.7. Move the engine throttle control to ―high‖ (1,000 -1,500) RPM. 3.9.2.8. Open left hand door under the operator’s console and turn the wash-down on/off (red) lever to the 12 o’clock position; then, pull water valve up. 3.9.2.9.  Wash  all  areas  of  the  machine  such  as  the  primary  and  secondary conveyors, cutter drum and housing, moldboard, track assemblies, drive mo-tors and torque hubs, engine and housing, mainframe, operator’s station and ladders. 3.9.2.10. Turn the wash-down on/off lever to the original 9 o’clock position and then turn the water valve off.    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    50 3.9.2.11. Return the engine throttle control to the ―low‖ RPM. 3.9.2.12. Remove the wash-down wand from the wash-down hose. 3.9.2.13. Return the wand to the toolbox and the hose to the hose reel. 3.9.2.14. Shut down engine. 3.10.  Grad-Line  Slope  Control  System.  The  control  module  and  handset are mounted and removed each working day and stored in the grad-line car-rying  case  in  order  to  prevent  damaging  moisture  exposure  and  to  protect against vandalism. When setting up the grad-line system for daily operation, mount the control module to the mounting frame assembly on top of the mil-ling machine by the instrument panel. Daily calibration of the grad-line slope control  system  is  required  by  the  machine  operator  in  order  to  set  the  ma-chine  up  for  slope  control.  These  settings  determine  how  precise  and  accu-rate  the  grad-line  system  stays  on  slope  during  milling  operation.  The  fea-tures, which must be entered in order for the control box to function proper-ly,  are:  zeroing  or  nulling  of  the  control  module  and  sensitivity.  Refer  to Figure 2.2. for an illustration of the grad-line control module and handset. NOTE! In order for the grad-line slope control system to be calibrated prop-erly  the  hydraulic  system  must  be  at  normal  operating  temperature; therefore  run  the  machine  hydraulic  system  for  five  minutes  before attempting to set the TOPCON system.  3.10.1. Grad-line Installation and Calibration.  3.10.1.1. Level machine transversely and longitudinally by raising or lower-ing the leg tube cylinders. 3.10.1.2.

Turn off the grade/slope switch on the milling machine instrument panel. 3.11. TOPCON Grade/Slope Systems.  13.11.1.  Operating  Setting.  The  control  boxes  and  sonic  trackers  are mounted and removed each working day and stored in the TOPCON carry-ing  case  in  order  to  prevent  damaging  moisture  exposure  and  to  protect against  vandalism.  The  slope  sensor,  jog  switches  and  junction  boxes  are mounted  on  the  machine  and  are  not  removed  once  installed.  When  setting up the TOPCON system for daily operation, mount the sonic trackers to the mounting frame assembly at the side of the machine and the control boxes to the top left and right side of the machine. Mount the control box with the ―L‖    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    53 marked  on  the  side  of  the  control  box  to  the  left  side  of  the  machine  and mount the control box with the ―R‖ marked on the side of the control box on the right side of the machine. Reversing the left and right control boxes with the  left  and  right  side  of  the  machine  will  cause  the  TOPCON  system  to function improperly. After the hardware and electrical cables are connected, proceed to the operator setting section below.  3.11.1.1. The operator settings are a series of features, which must be entered into  the  TOPCON  control  box  by  the  machine  operator  in  order  to  set  the machine up for grade and slope control by the  TOPCON system. These set-tings  determine  how  precise  and  accurate  the  TOPCON  system  stays  on grade  and  slope  during  milling  operation.  The  setting  features,  which  must be entered in order for the control box to function properly, are: gain (eleva-tion, gain (slope), slope resolution, beeper, hour meter, deadband, valve off-sets  and  units.  Refer  to  Figure  2.4.  for  an  illustration  of  the  TOPCON Grade/Slope Control Box. NOTE! In  order  for  the  TOPCON  Grade  and  Slope  Control  System  to  be calibrated properly the hydraulic system must be at normal operating temperature. Therefore, run the machine hydraulic system for at least five minutes before attempting to set the TOPCON System.  3.11.1.2. Level machine transversely and longitudinally by raising or lower-ing the leg tube cylinders. 3.11.1.3. Turn on the TOPCON Grade and Slope Control Box and access the operator’s  settings  by  holding  the  auto/manual/survey  (cal.)  switch  down while holding the elevation/slope switch either up or down. 3.11.1.4. Continue holding the auto/manual/survey (cal.) and elevation/slope switches while the TOPCON revision number and machine code are flashed across  the  liquid  crystal  display  (LCD)  (in  the  event  that  an  uncorrectable error may occur, the TOPCON revision number and machine code will have to be copied so that you can identify the specific TOPCON program on your system when discussing the problem with TOPCON personnel).    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    54 3.11.1.5.

During performance setting sequence  the blank  screen  must be accessed before exiting  from the operator  setting  sequence  or  the  settings  will  not  be  saved  in  the  control box’s memory. 3.12. Maintenance Safety Precautions. Adhere to the following safety pre-cautions  when  performing  maintenance  on  the  milling  machine.  See  the manufacturer’s  Operation  and  Service  Manual  for  actual  maintenance  re-quirements and instructions. Do not work under this machine with the engine running or without the safety bars in place. This could result in serious injury or death. WARNING! WARNING! Before  doing  any  maintenance,  service,  or  repairs,  read  and  under-stand the safety precautions identified in paragraph 2.5. of this pub-lications to avoid personal injury.   3.12.1. Never service, clean, or examine the unit with the engine running. 3.12.2.  Never  service  or  perform  maintenance  to  the  unit  unless  the  track safety bars are in place. 3.12.3. Never fill the tank with the engine running, while near an open flame, or when smoking. Always wipe up spilled fuel. 3.12.4. Never remove the pressurized radiator cap until the engine’s cooling system has cooled. 3.12.5.  Do  not  alter  the  engine  governor  settings  from  that  indicated  in  the engine manual and engine option plate.    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    57 3.12.6. Never change cutter drum teeth while the engine is running. 3.12.7. Always replace damaged or lost decals. Refer to the parts manual for the proper location and part number of all decals. 3.12.8. Disconnect the battery from the electrical system by turning the elec-trical disconnect switch (Figure 3.31.) located inside the belt guard/toolbox whenever working on the electrical system or whenever welding on the ma-chine. Figure 3.31. Battery Disconnect Switch.  3.12.9. Ensure the battery area is well ventilated before connecting a battery cable or jump starting. Fumes can ignite by a spark and explode. 3.12.10.  Always  use  caution  when  working  with  hot,  pressurized  systems; otherwise, you can be burned by hot fluids.  3.12.11.  Never  fill  the  fuel  tank  while  the  engine  is  running,  near  an  open flame, or when smoking. Always wipe up any spilled fuel. 3.12.12. Visually check the entire unit in regard to capscrews, nuts, and pins being properly secured. Check several capscrews and nuts for proper torque. If any are found loose, a more thorough investigation must be made.    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    58 3.12.13. The operating temperature of the system should not exceed 180 de-grees  Fahrenheit  (82  degrees  Celsius)  continuous  and  220  degrees  Fahren-heit (104 degrees Celsius) intermittent at the case drain. 3.12.14.  Under  operating  conditions,  the  fluid  viscosity  must  be  above  55 SUS (9cST) continuously and never less than 47 SUS (6.4 cST). 3.13.  Lubrication.  It  cannot  be  overstated  that  the  life  and  reliability  of  a milling machine is greatly affected by the type, frequency, and care of lubri-cation.  Dirt  particles  that  are  difficult  to  see  with  the  human  eye  can  cause many  thousands  of  dollars  worth  of  damage  to  a  mechanical  or  hydraulic system.  Lubricants  must be properly stored in clean and covered containers that are properly marked to identify their use. If containers are used to carry lubricants  from  bulk  storage  tanks,  they  should  be  thoroughly  cleaned  and provided with covers. See the manufacturer’s Operation and Service Manual for the lubrication requirements and instructions. 3.13.1.  A  lubrication  schedule  is  provided  in  the  manufacture’s  Operation and Service Manual with suggested service intervals. If operating conditions are severe, shorter intervals may be required. Only quality lubricants should be used which conform to the lubricant specifications. Fluid levels should be checked when the machine is parked on a level surface. 3.13.2.  Before  removing  caps  and  plugs,  thoroughly  clean  the  area  around them. Grease fittings and grease gun adapters must be cleaned before inject-ing  grease.  Funnels  should  be  washed  with  solvents  and  thoroughly  dried before  and  after  use.  Clean  all  grease  fittings  after  use  and  wipe  up  spilled oils to avoid accumulation and hazardous walkways. 3.13.3. Lubrication should be performed at the end of the day right after the machine  has  been  washed  down.  Lubricants  and  debris  are  most  easily flushed  while  they  are  warm.  This  is  particularly  true  in  the  material  han-dling areas of the machine. 3.13.4.  Over  lubrication  on  non-sealed  fittings  will  not  harm  the  fittings  or components, but under lubrication will definitely lead to a shorter life. 3.13.5. All grease fittings are  Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) stan-dard  unless  otherwise  noted.  Grease  unsealed  fittings  until  grease  is  seen    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    59 extruding  from  the  fitting.  One  ounce  of  EP-MPG  equals  one  pump  on  a standard grease gun. 3.13.6.  Clean  fuel,  lubricants,  and  hydraulic  oil  from  walkways  or  loss  of footing may occur resulting in serious injury or even death. 3.13.7.  Unless  otherwise  indicated,  items  not  equipped  with  grease  fittings, such as linkages, pins levers, should be lubricated with oil once a week. Mo-tor  oil,  applied  sparingly,  will  provide  the  necessary  lubrication  and  help prevent  the  formation  of  rust.  An  anti-seize  compound  may  be  used  if  rust has not formed, otherwise the part must be cleaned first. 3.13.8. Lubricants must be at operating temperature when draining. 3.14.  Changing  Cutting  Teeth.  The  life  of  the  cutter  drum  teeth  will  vary with  the  type  of  material  being  cut,  the  temperature  and  the  span  of  opera-tion.  The  machine  can  mill  approximately  2,000  feet  in  soft  asphalt  before inspecting the teeth. Check the length of the teeth  once an hour and replace them  before  the  carbide  insert  is  worn  completely.  If  the  teeth  are  not  re-placed  when  needed, the  holders  will  start  hitting and be severely damaged or even torn from the cutter drum. It is much easier to replace the teeth than to  replace  a  holder  and  teeth.  Perform  the  following  steps  to  inspect  and change cutting teeth.  CAUTION! Do  not  lower  the  cutting  drum  when  the  cutter  is  not  turning.  The weight  of  the  cutter  drum  can  break  the  teeth  and  can  damage  the cutter drum and/or bearings. Always use eye protection whenever replacing cutter drum teeth. WARNING! Shut engine off and lock pins in place before replacing teeth. WARNING!         AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    60 3.14.1. At low idle only, disengage the clutch.  3.14.2. Take the rear moldboard out of the float position and then raise it to expose the teeth. To raise it higher, pull out on safety lock at the top-left of the  mold  board.  With  opposite  hand  reach  directly  behind  you  to  move  the red  toggle  switch  to  raise  the  moldboard  higher.  This  will  enact  an  engine safety that will cause the engine to shut down. It will not start again until the moldboard  is  lowered  with  the  red  toggle  switch  (pull  the  safety  pin  out while lowering). 3.14.3. An air hammer, a straight punch for the air hammer and a drive pin can be used to replace the teeth quickly. To change a tooth without the use of an air hammer, insert the tip of the drive pin into the opening in the rear of the tooth holder and strike the drive pin sharply  with a hammer to dislodge the tooth.  3.14.4. If a tooth holder is found to be broken, stick the long bent tool in the back of it and pound it out. Line up the groove to pound a new one in. 3.14.5. Insert a new tooth into the holder  with a hammer so that the keeper spring is engaged with the holder.         AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    61 Chapter 4 GENERAL MILLING PRACTICES 4.1. Milling Preparation. 4.1.1.  Obtain  project  drawings  from  the  customer  and  ensure  they  show  1) location  and  extent  of  pavement;  2)  required  elevation  of  finish  surface  of new pavement; 3) a section indicating in mm (inches) the depth that the ex-isting  pavement  has  to  be  removed;  4)  the  location  of  existing  manholes, valve  boxes,  in-pavement  lights,  and  utility  lines;  and  5)  location  of  pave-ment reinforcement layers (e.g., fabrics and/or grids) if applicable. 4.1.2. Provide notice to civil engineer unit at least seven days prior to start-ing  work  to  allow  them  to  coordinate  the  milling  operation  with  other  base agencies at the site.  4.1.3. If the milled material is to be recycled, clean the pavement surface of excessive  dirt,  clay,  or  other  foreign  material  immediately  prior  to  milling the pavement. 4.2. Milling Operation. Provide all necessary traffic controls during milling operations.  Milling  shall  not  be  performed  when  there  is  accumulation  of snow or ice on the pavement surface. 4.2.1. Make sufficient passes so that the designated area is milled to grades and cross sections indicated. Proceed with care and in depth increments that will not damage the pavement below the designated finished grade.  4.2.2.  If  design  does  not  include  removal  of  base  course  material  and  it  is desired  not  to  disturb  the  base  course,  ensure  only  bituminous  pavement  is removed and base course is not disturbed. Leave in place a layer of bitumin-ous  pavement,  .25  to  .5  inch  thick,  over  the  undisturbed  base  course.  Fur-thermore,  when  a  paving  fabric  or  grid  is  known  to  exist  in  the  underlying pavement structure and is to remain in place, mill no closer to the fabric or grid than a distance equal to the top size of the in place aggregate (typically .5 to .75 inches).    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    62 4.2.3. When the milled material is to be cold recycled, the maximum size for the cuttings should be equal to or less than one-half of the recycled pavement thickness. Generally, the maximum size for a single 4 inch lift of pavement will  be  2  inches  or  less.  Removed  material  shall  meet  the  design  require-ments and be in accordance with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) C 136. 4.2.4.  Remove  and  distribute/dispose  of  the  milled  material  as  specified  in the project plans. Store or stockpile materials milled from different pavement sections in separate homogeneous stockpiles rather than conglomerate stock-piles.  Homogeneous  RAP  sources  are  more  consistent  in  terms  of  asphalt binder and aggregate type and properties, and will lead to improved consis-tency  in  mixture  design  and  a  better  finished  product.  Milled  materials should  be  fractionated  (i.e.,  separated/sieved)  when  used  in  RAP  to  ensure proper mix design and production control. 4.2.5. When the milling is done under traffic maintained conditions:  4.2.5.1. Uniformly mill the entire lane width with one machine or a combina-tion of milling machines in tandem. 4.2.5.2. Milling should be performed on the adjacent lane in the same day if the milling results in a vertical longitudinal face greater than 1 inch in depth between  the  lanes.  At  the  end  of  each  day,  no  more  than  500  feet  should have a drop off of over 1 inch. Work should be scheduled so that a vertical drop off will not be present between traffic lanes over weekends, holidays, or other extended periods when work is not being performed. 4.2.5.3.  Transitions  between  milled  and  unmilled  surfaces  should  be  fea-thered  either  by  milling  or  with  wedges  of  bituminous  material  (maximum slope: 1 horizontal to 4 vertical). 4.2.5.4. When working to adjacent traffic, if the milled material spills in the traveled way, immediately remove the material. 4.2.6.  Surfacing  material  that  cannot  be  removed  by  milling  equipment  be-cause of physical or geometric constraints should be removed by other  me-thods approved by the project engineer.    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    63 4.2.7. If traffic has been detoured from the milled area, the surface should be swept  once  per  day.  When  milling  is  performed  under  traffic  maintained conditions, the milled surface should be swept before opened to traffic. 4.2.8.  When  both  the  driving  lane(s)  and  shoulders  are  to  be  milled,  they should be  milled the same day to eliminate traffic lane surface drainage re-strictions. 4.2.8.1. When the surfaced shoulders are not milled, drainage channels in the shoulders  may  be  cut  by  milling  or  by  any  other  method  approved  by  the project engineer. The width should be 2 feet minimum, and the depth should be  the  same  as  the  milling  depth  with  sufficient  spacing  to  provide  proper drainage. This operation should be performed as directed by  the project en-gineer. 4.2.8.2.  Drainage  channels  should  be  repaired  by  patching  with  asphaltic concrete  of  the  type  in  the  adjacent  surfacing  before  the  outside  surfaced shoulder are fog sealed or surfaced. 4.2.8.3.  Earth  shoulders  should  be  cut  to  an  elevation  that  will  allow  drai-nage. 4.2.9. Damage to  milled surfaces, prior to overlaying, resulting  from traffic or other causes such as, but not limited to , raveling, fuel spillage or any con-taminates  which  would  inhibit  bonding  shall  be  repaired  or  remilled  in  a manner approved by the project engineer. 4.3. Quality Control Requirements. 4.3.1.  Grade-Conformance  Tests.  Test  the  finished  milled  surface  of  the pavement for conformance  with the plan-grade requirements and for accep-tance by the approving Officer by running lines of levels at  customer speci-fied  intervals  (typically  25  feet  longitudinally  and  25  feet  transversely)  to determine  the  elevation  of  the  completed  pavement.  The  finished  milled pavement  surfaces  should not vary  more than .25 inch  from the established plan  grade  line  and  elevation.  Correct  variations  from  the  designated  grade line and elevation in excess of the plan-grade requirements as directed. Typi-cally,  skin  patching  for  correcting  low  areas  will  not  be  permitted;  remove    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    64 and  replace  the  deficient  low  area.  Remove  sufficient  material  to  allow  at least 1 inch of asphalt concrete to be placed. NOTE! For  pavements  in  aircraft  traffic  areas  such  as  airfield  runways  and taxiways,  lines  of  levels  to  determine  elevation  of  the  milled  pave-ment will be run longitudinally and  transversely at intervals not ex-ceeding 25 feet.   4.3.2. Surface-Smoothness Tests. After completion of the final milling, the finished  milled  surface  is  typically  tested  with  a  straightedge.  Other  ap-proved devices may be used, provided that when satisfactorily and properly operated,  such  devices  reveal  all  surface  irregularities  exceeding  the  toler-ances  specified.  Correct  surface  irregularities  that  depart  from  the  testing edge  by  more  than  0.25  inch.  Typically,  skin  patching  for  correcting  low areas  will  not  be  permitted;  remove  and  replace  the  deficient  low  area.  Re-move  sufficient  material  to  allow  at  least  1  inch  of  asphalt  concrete  to  be placed. 4.4. Post Operation.  4.4.1.  Repair or  replace,  as  directed,  items  damaged  during  milling  such  as manholes, valve boxes, utility lines, pavement that is torn, cracked, gouged, broken, or undercut.  4.4.2. After milling, pavement surfaces should be cleaned off by sweeping or washing before any overlay is placed; otherwise, debris such as dirt and dust may decrease bonding between the  new overlay and the existing pavement. When  sweeping,  more  than  one  pass  is  typically  needed  to  remove  all  the debris; continue sweeping until all debris is removed. If the milled surface is washed, the pavement must be allowed to dry prior to paving.  4.4.3. When the milled surface is to be opened to traffic: 4.4.3.1.  Vertical  cuts  resulting  in  an  elevation  differential  of  greater  than  2 inches along a gutter line or shoulder line should be protected by temporary barricades and warning signs erected.    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    65 4.4.3.2. If milling removed pavement  markings, temporary pavement  mark-ing should be placed before opening the road for public use. 4.4.3.3. If opened to traffic longer than 30 days, the texture produced by the milling operation should be uniform and provide a satisfactory riding surface and  skid  resistance.  Continuous  longitudinal  striations  should  not  be  al-lowed.     HERBERT J.

Its two principle properties are adhesion and cohesion. bitumen—mixture  of  organic  liquids  that  are  highly  viscous,  black,  sticky, entirely soluble in carbon disulfide, and composed primarily of highly con-densed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; primarily used for paving roads. filler  material—fills  the  voids  between  aggregate  grains  and  improves  the wearing capabilities of the overall mix gradation—the  proportion  of  particles  (such  as  aggregate)  of  a  given  size within a sample of particulate material, such as soil or sandstone; the aggre-gates particle size distribution. heater-Planing—heating the surface of a bituminous concrete pavement and planing the surface to the desired grade. hydroplaning—occurs when a layer of water builds between the rubber tires of  the  vehicle  and  the  road  surface,  leading  to  the  loss  of  traction  and  thus preventing  the  vehicle  from  responding  to  control  inputs  such  as  steering, braking or accelerating.  leveling  course—initial  lifts  placed  directly  on  to  the  existing  pavement  to fill low spots in the pavement. milling  (also  called  grinding  or  cold  planning)—removing  a  layer  of  pave-ment  by  a  milling  machine;  used  to  smooth  an  existing  pavement  prior  to flexible  or  rigid  overlays;  allows  curb  and  gutter  lines  to  be  maintained  or reestablished  before  flexible  overlays;  provides  an  efficient  removal  tech-nique  for  material  near  overhead  structures  in  order  to  maintain  clearances for bridge structures, traffic signals, and overhead utilities. nuclear gauge density testing—a test procedure for determining the density of  bituminous  concrete  by  the  attenuation  of  gamma  radiation  where  the source and detector remain on the surface.    AFH 10-222 Volume 24   20 April 2011    69 pavement  recycling—a  process  that  recycles  the  existing  asphalt  in-place, with  the  addition  of  some  new  aggregates  and  emulsion,  to  provide  a  new pavement material layer. Portland  cement  concrete  (PCC)—used  to  produce  rigid  pavements  con-sisting  of  a  PCC  slab  that  is  usually  supported  by  a  granular  or  stabilized base,  and  a  sub-base.  In  some  cases  the  PCC  slab  may  be  overlaid  with  a layer of asphalt concrete. raveling—a form of pavement distress involving the dislodgement of aggre-gates from the surface of an asphalt pavement. recycled  cold  mix—mixing  RAP  as  an  aggregate  with  new  emulsified  or foamed  asphalt  and/or  a  recycling  or  rejuvenating  agent,  possibly  also  with virgin aggragate, without the use of heat.  recycled  hot  mix—mixing  heated  RAP  with  a  recycling  or  rejuvenating agent,  possibly  adding  virgin  asphalt  and/or  aggregate,  and  replacing  it  on the pavement  rejuvenator—reconditions asphalt pavements by penetrating somewhat into the asphalt concrete and soften (rejuvenate) the asphalt binder. The rejuvena-tor also helps to seal the pavement and minimize future oxidation. tack coat—diluted emulsified asphalt materials placed on an existing pave-ment  surface  prior  to  a  hot-mix  asphalt  overlay.  It  provides  the  necessary bond between the underlying/adjacent layers and the new pavement surface.
