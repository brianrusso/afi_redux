Therefore, if a member is transferring from one servicing MPF to another and is retraining and reenlisting concur-rently with their transfer, he or she will not be eligible for a retraining bonus.  For example, a member cur-rently assigned to MPF servicing R9 in AFSC 4N0X1 (non-bonus) transferring to MPF servicing ID W9,AFSC 2W0X1B (bonus) would not be eligible to receive a retraining incentive (bonus).1.6.

Briefing. The most frequent cause of inquiries and complaints on incentive bonuses stem from per-sonnel who claim they were promised an incentive bonus.  MPFs and recruiting personnel should exercisecare and discretion in explaining bonus eligibility and entitlement criteria, net amount of bonus, and thefact that bonus AFSC lists change during the course of the fiscal year.  Eligibility for a bonus depends onthe member meeting eligibility requirements and the bonus AFSC list in effect at the time of enlistment,reenlistment, affiliation, or approval of retraining.  Entitlement begins with approval of the AF Form4021, Application for Incentive Participation, by HQ AFRC/DPMB.  Emphasize eligibility and entitle-ment along with bonus termination policies when counseling potential bonus recipients.  Thorough brief-ings on the bonus program may prevent unnecessary corrections of military records.Table 2.1.

The following changes to AFI 36-2638, USAFR Enlisted Incentive Program are effective immediately, and will be included in the revision of the AFI.  A "|" indicates revised material since the last edition. 1.1.7.

Has completed any active service commitment and possesses less than 14 years total service (based on Armed Forces enlistment contractual agreement on pay date) at the time of enlistment.  EXAMPLE:  A member who enlists in the Navy incurs a 4-year active duty commitment and 4 years reserve commit-ment (total of an 8-year MSO).  Once the member completes 4 years of active duty Armed Forces enlist-ment contractual agreement, and subsequently, enlists in the Air Force Reserve, he is now eligible for a Prior Service (PS) bonus, provided all other criteria established in AFI 36-2638 is met. 1.6.5.  Has less than 14 years total service (based on pay date) at the time of enlistment. 2.1.  Incentive Eligibility Amounts.  Refer to Table 2.1., Table 2.2., Table 2.3., Table 2.4., Table 2.5., Table 2.6. and Table 2.7. for payment schedules.

NOTE:  for NPS, entitlement begins with date of enlistment. NOTE:  If a member has a bonus and reenlists for more than 30 days before their ETS, a waiver is required from HQ AFRC/DPMR prior to reenlistment unless reenlisting to satisfy retainability require-ments for the Montgomery G.I. Bill.  Although reenlistment for the G.I. Bill can take place at any time, it does not automatically make a member eligible for a reenlistment bonus. 2.1.2.3.  Variable A - $8000 for a member enlisting for a term of 6 years after 1 June 2003; Variable B - $4000 for a member enlisting for a term of 3 years after 1 June 2003, and Variable C - $3500 for a member reenlisting for a term of 3 years following a prior 3 year enlistment.  (See Table 2.7.) 2.1.3.3.  NOTE:  A person may not be paid more than one 6-year enlistment or two 3-year enlistment/reenlistment bonuses.  The second 3-year bonus is authorized only if the member enters into a subsequent reenlistment before the date, which the reenlistment/prior service enlistment for the first 3-year bonus expires, and still satisfies the designated skill or unit requirement for which a bonus is authorized. 2.1.4.1.  If the member has 12 months or less remaining on their Reserve obligation at the time of affilia-tion, pay the total bonus at the sixth anniversary from their original enlistment (based on pay date). AFI36-2638   26 JANUARY 2005512.1.4.2.
