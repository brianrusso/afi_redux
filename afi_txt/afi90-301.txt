Overview.  This chapter covers the background, authority, and purpose of the IG system.  It defines  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  IGs  and  other  offices  and  agencies  involved  in  the  IG process.    It  also  covers  the  organization  of  the  IG  system  throughout  the  Air  Force,  Air  Force Reserve, and Air National Guard. 1.2.  The IG System.  The IG system used throughout the total force is based on the concept that IGs  serve  as  an  extension  of  their  commander  by  acting  as  his/her  eyes  and  ears  to  be  alert  to issues  affecting  the  organization.    IGs  primarily  serve  their  commanders  and  their  assigned organizations both by executing the complaint resolution process and by proactively training all members of the organization about IG processes and fraud, waste, and abuse (FWA) issues.  A successful  complaint  resolution  program  is  designed  to  enhance  the  organization’s  discipline, readiness, and  warfighting capability.  IGs use fact-finding methodologies to seek out systemic issues affecting the organization. 1.2.1.  The  effectiveness  of  the  IG  system  requires  the  mutual  cooperation  of  all  Air  Force IGs. 1.2.2.  IGs assist Airmen of all ranks, family members, civilian employees, retirees, and other civilians.    These  individuals  represent  the  IG’s  constituency,  and  IGs  bolster  the  chain  of command by performing a problem-solving mission in support of this constituency. 1.2.3.  All  IGs  must  maintain  a  clear  distinction  between  being  an  extension  of  the commander and their duty to serve as fair, impartial, and objective fact-finders and problem solvers.    They  must  be  sufficiently  independent  so  those  complainants  requesting  IG  help will  continue  to  do  so,  even  when  they  feel  the  commander  may  be  the  problem.  Commanders must support this clear distinction for their IGs to be effective. 1.2.4.  The IG system support process includes operational planning, training, administration, personnel, and resource management.  These processes facilitate the execution of complaint resolution processes to all Air Force leaders. 1.2.5.  Operational  readiness  is  integrated  into  all  phases  of  the  IG  system.    IGs  provide complaint resolution services at all times. 1.3.  Relationships  Within  the  IG  System.  IGs  may  request  and  are  expected  to  provide support to other IGs within the total force IG system.  The IG system is not a stovepipe system because  IGs  work  for  their  respective  commanders.    All  IGs  who  work  matters  under  the Complaint  Resolution  Program  (CRP)  must  adhere  to  IG  policies.    SAF/IG  maintains  the integrity of the IG system through policy, training, and oversight. Section 1B—Authority of The Air Force Inspector General 1.4.  Key  Terms.

Host Wing IG Program Background. 1.20.1.  The  concept  of  appointing  a  separate,  full-time  host  wing  IG  was  implemented  to remove  any  perceived  conflict  of  interest,  lack  of  independence,  or  apprehension  by  Air Force personnel as a result of the previous practice of assigning vice commanders IG duties.  This  issue  was  identified  in  Committee  Report  H.R.  4301  of  the  1995  National  Defense Authorization Act. 1.20.2.  To  sustain  a  trustworthy  relationship  with  Air  Force  personnel,  the  host  wing  IG must be independent (see paragraphs 1.2.3 and  1.27.3).  Air Force personnel must be free from  any  form  of  retribution,  retaliation,  or  reprisal  for  communicating  with  the  host  wing IG. 1.21.  Establishment of the Installation IG Program. 1.21.1.  Independent IGs will be established at all active component, Air Force Reserve, and Air  National  Guard  wings.    The  desired  rank/grade  for  the  Host/Wing  IG  is  lieutenant colonel  or  employee  meeting  the  requirements  of  the  position  description  (PD).    (T-1).  Appointing authorities  are highly discouraged  from selecting  IGs lower than the rank of  Lt Col  or  civilian  equivalent.    Only  in  extreme  circumstances  should  an  appointing  authority select  a non-field  grade officer to  lead their  IG section.   IG sections led  by non-field  grade officers  or  enlisted  IGs  are  not  perceived  by  complainants  to  have  the  same  ability  as  field grade  officers  to  address  command  issues  such  as  command  climates,  abusive/hostile environments or other misconduct by leadership in the unit. 1.21.1.1.  Host/Wing  IG  (87GXX).    Be  an  O-5/  civilian  equivalent  or  higher.    (T-1).  Appointing authorities are highly discouraged from selecting IGs lower than the rank of Lt  Col  or  civilian  equivalent.    Only  in  extreme  circumstances  should  an  appointing authority select a non-field grade officer to lead the IG section.  IG sections led by non-field  grade  officers  or  enlisted  IGs  are  not  perceived  by  complainants  or  inspectees  to have  the  same  ability  as  field  grade  officers  to:    1)  address  command  issues  such  as  28 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 command  climates,  abusive/hostile  environments  or  other  misconduct  by  leadership  in the unit; or 2) inspect and report on the full spectrum of unit effectiveness. 1.21.1.2.  Host/Wing  Director  of  Complaints  Resolution  (87QXX)  and  Host/Wing Director of Inspections (87IXX) will be an O-4/civilian equivalent or higher.  (T-1). 1.21.1.3.  Host/Wing Inspections Superintendent (8IXXX).  Be an E-9 to E-8 or civilian equivalent.    Wing/CC  may  waive  this  requirement  on  a  case-by-case  basis  if  qualified candidates are not available to the rank of E-7.  (T-3). 1.21.2.  Associate  unit  personnel  may  use  the  host/wing  IG  for  complaint  analysis  and assistance. 1.22.  Host/Wing IG Organization. 1.22.1.  The host wing IG is organized as a staff function and will report directly to the host wing commander.  (T-1). 1.22.2.  The two-letter functional address code for the Office of the Inspector General at all levels  will be ”IG“  and the office symbol shall be ”unit designation/IG“ (e.g., 51 FW/IG) .  (T-1). 1.23.  Unique Requirements for Air National Guard (ANG) IGs. 1.23.1.  Each  ANG  wing  is  authorized  an  inspector  general  on  the  military  manpower document.  The wing IG is a peacetime Unit Type Code (UTC.) 1.23.1.1.  Air National Guard wing IGs are organized as a staff function and will report directly to the wing commander. 1.23.2.  The authorized grade for individuals serving as the wing IG is lieutenant colonel. 1.23.2.1.  Selection  or  assignment  of  a  lower  grade  officer  (e.g.,  a  major  for  lieutenant colonel position) requires coordination with SAF/IGQ prior to nomination. 1.23.2.2.  Waiver requests to nominate a company grade officer as the wing  IG will not be considered. 1.23.3.  To  appoint  an  ANG  wing  IG,  the  ANG  wing  commander  nominates  a  qualified candidate in writing.  The written appointment is endorsed by the JFHQ-(State) IG (or TAG where no state IG is assigned) who forwards a copy to SAF/IGQ for information. 1.23.4.  The tour of appointment for ANG members appointed as the IG should be for three or  four  years.    A  new  appointment  must  be  completed  each  time  a  subsequent  IG  is appointed. 1.23.5.  The wing IG will be responsible for all complaint resolution matters occurring within the wing and within any Geographically Separate Units (GSUs) supported by the wing. 1.23.6.  JFHQ-(State)  is  authorized  to  assign  ANG  members  within  their  state  IG  office  to manage cases involving ANG personnel.  Manpower authorizations and grade determination are under the purview of each JFHQ-(State).  ANG members assigned to the state IG office will  complete  Air  Force  inspector  general  training  (and  Army  inspector  general  training  as required by the state IG).  The Adjutant General will select and appoint ANG members to the state IG office.  The written appointment will be sent to SAF/IGQ.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 29 1.23.6.1.  JFHQ  IG in  each state is  a staff  function that reports directly to The Adjutant General (TAG).  The JFHQ-(State) IG has duties and responsibilities related to both the Army National Guard and Air National Guard IG systems. 1.23.7.  In  states  where  no  ANG  members  are  assigned  to  the  JFHQ  IG  office,  actions associated with  the CRP will be completed by the assigned Army or Army National  Guard staff. 1.24.  Assigning Additional Duties to IGs. 1.24.1.  The focus of host/wing IGs must be the Air Force Complaints Resolution, Inspection and FWA Programs.  (T-1).  Any activities that may diminish the effectiveness of IGs in the performance of their complaints resolution and FWA responsibilities are not acceptable. 1.24.2.  The IG position will not be combined with another position in the organization.  (T-1).    Operational  duties  required  to  maintain  qualification/currency,  as  well  as  inspection related responsibilities and duties defined in AFI 90-201, are not considered additional duties for the IG and staff. 1.24.3.  IGs  must  not  be  constrained  by  additional  duties  that  detract  from  their  primary responsibilities.  (T-1).  Therefore, IGs and IG staff members must not be: 1.24.3.1.  Assigned  any  duties  (such  as  Director  of  Staff)  that  subsequently  disqualify them from  conducting an unbiased analysis  of complaints against functions or activities of  the  wing  or  installation  to  which  they  are  assigned  or  organizations  for  which  they have IG functional responsibility.  (T-1). 1.24.3.1.1.  IGs  will  not  serve  as  mediators  in  support  of  Equal  Opportunity  or Alternate Dispute Resolution actions.  (T-1).  These activities require the IG to make assessments and recommendations that could later be called into question should the interested parties decide to file an IG complaint regarding those proceedings. 1.24.3.2.  Appointed  as  an  IO  to  conduct  a  CDI.  (NOTE:  Air  Force  Reserve  and  Air National  Guard  IGs  may  be  appointed  to  conduct  CDIs  at  installations  other  than  their own.)  (T-1). 1.24.3.3.  Given responsibility for the host wing commander’s ”action line”.  (T-1). 1.24.4.  Host wing IGs may act as the main processing POC for congressional inquiries.  (T-1). Section 1F—Commanders and the Inspector General Program 1.25.  Key  Terms.  This  section  uses  the  following  key  terms:    frivolous  allegation,  gross mismanagement,  independence  and  ombudsman.    Refer  to  Attachment  1  for  the  definition  of these key terms. 1.26.  How the IG System Helps the Commander. 1.26.1.  Complaints  help  commanders  discover  and  correct  problems  affecting the productivity  and  morale  of  assigned  personnel.    Resolving  the  underlying  cause  of  a complaint  may  prevent  more  severe  symptoms  or  costly  consequences,  such  as  reduced performance, accidents, poor quality work, poor morale, or loss of resources.  30 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 1.26.2.  Even  though  allegations  may  not  be  substantiated,  the  evidence  or  investigation findings  may  reveal  systemic,  morale,  or  other  problems  impeding  efficiency  and  mission effectiveness. 1.27.  Roles of the IG in Relation to the Commander. 1.27.1.  The roles of the IG are to: 1.27.1.1.  Be  the  ”eyes  and  ears”  of  the  commander;  be  alert  for  and  inform  the commander  of  matters  indicative  of  systemic,  morale,  or  other  problems  impeding efficiency and mission effectiveness.  (T-1). 1.27.1.2.  Keep  the  commander  informed  of  potential  areas  of  concern  as  reflected  by trends based on analysis of complaint data.  (T-1). 1.27.1.3.

The  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  Office  of  Public  Affairs  (SAF/PA)  facilitates:  the appropriate  release  of  information  regarding  IG  cases  to  news  media  representatives.    News media  requests  for  IG  records  will  be  processed  through  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act.  SAF/PA is  responsible for informing media officials of the proper procedures for obtaining  IG records through the Freedom of Information Act.    40 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 1.49.  The Headquarters Air Force Directorate of Security Forces (AF/A7S) assists SAF/IG by: 1.49.1.

Policy for Filing an IG Complaint. 2.1.1.  Air  Force  military  and  civilian  employees  (appropriated  and  non-appropriated  fund), unless  otherwise  exempted  by  operation  of  law,  regulation,  or  policy,  have  a  duty  to promptly  report  FWA  or  gross  mismanagement;  a  violation  of  law,  policy,  procedures, instructions,  or  regulations;  an  injustice;  abuse  of  authority,  inappropriate  conduct,  or misconduct  (as  defined  by  this  instruction);  and  a  deficiency  or  like  condition,  through appropriate  supervisory  channels,  to  an  IG  or  other  appropriate  inspector,  or  through  an established grievance channel.  FWA complaints may also be reported to the AFAA, AFOSI, Security  Forces,  or  other  proper  authority.    All  military  and  civilian  employees,  unless otherwise  exempted  by  operation  of  law,  regulation,  or  policy,  must  promptly  advise  the AFOSI of suspected criminal misconduct or fraud. 2.1.2.  Complainants  should  attempt  to  resolve  complaints  at  the  lowest  possible  level (appropriate  for  the  circumstances)  using  supervisory  channels  before  addressing  them  to higher-level command channels or the IG. 2.1.3.  When  complaints  are  addressed  to  a  higher  level  (the  President,  Congress,  IG  DoD, CSAF, SAF/IG, etc.), the IG office tasked with the complaint will determine the appropriate level or organization for redress of the complaint.  The complaint may be referred back to the complainant’s local IG for resolution. 2.1.4.  When  complainants  send  the  same  or  a  similar  complaint  to  several  levels  of  the government,  the  highest  level  with  which  the  complainant  corresponds  will  reply,  unless determined  otherwise  by  the  higher  level  office  or  other  directives.    If  it  is  decided  that  a lower level will respond, the IG must inform the complainant they will not receive separate replies  from  various  levels  of  the  government  and  inform  the  complainant  which  level  will provide the response. 2.2.  Approval of Official Travel to Submit Complaints. 2.2.1.  Complainants  normally  do  not  travel  at  government  expense  to  present  a  complaint unless authorized.  If authorized, funding will come from the complainant’s unit or funded by complainant's personal funds and travel conducted in leave or permissive TDY status.  Such travel may only be funded IAW the Joint Travel Regulation. 2.2.2.  Requests to travel to meet with SAF/IG personnel must be coordinated with SAF/IGS or SAF/IGQ prior to unit approval of the TDY request. 2.3.  Complaints Not Appropriate for the IG System. 2.3.1.  The  IG  CRP  should  not  be  used  for  matters  normally  addressed  through  other established grievance or appeal channels, unless there is evidence those channels mishandled the matter or process.  42 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 2.3.1.1.  If a policy directive or instruction provides a specific means of redress or appeal of  a  grievance,  complainants  must  exhaust  those  procedures  before  filing  an  IG complaint. 2.3.1.2.  Complainants  must  provide  relevant  evidence  that  the  process  was  mishandled or  handled  prejudicially  before  the  IG  will  process  a  complaint  of  mishandling.    Mere dissatisfaction or disagreement with the outcome or findings of an alternative grievance or appeal process is not a sufficient basis to warrant an IG investigation. 2.3.2.  Table  3.6  outlines  agencies  with  established  programs  for  the  redress  of  various complaints.  The table is not all-inclusive.  Matters without specific grievance channels or not mentioned in Table 3.6 may generally be referred back to the chain of command. Section 2B—Complainant’s Rights and Responsibilities 2.4.  Complainant’s Rights.  Complainants have the right to: 2.4.1.  In accordance with The Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended by The Inspector General  Reform  Act  of  2008,  Title  5,  Appendix  3,  Section  7;  Complaints  by  Employees, Disclosure of Identity, Reprisals: 2.4.1.1.  The  Inspector  General  may  receive  and  investigate  complaints  or  information from  an  employee  of  the  establishment  concerning  the  possible  existence  of  an  activity constituting  a  violation  of  law,  rules,  or  regulations,  or  mismanagement,  gross  waste  of funds,  abuse  of  authority  or  a  substantial  and  specific  danger  to  the  public  health  and safety. 2.4.1.2.  The Inspector General shall not, after receipt of a complaint or information from an employee, disclose the identity of the employee without the consent of the employee, unless the Inspector General determines such disclosure is unavoidable during the course of the investigation. 2.4.1.3.  Any  employee  who  has  authority  to  take,  direct  others  to  take,  recommend,  or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority, take or threaten to take any personnel action against any employee as a reprisal for making a complaint or disclosing  information  to  an  Inspector  General,  unless  the  complaint  was  made  or  the information disclosed with the knowledge that it was false or with willful disregard for its truth or falsity. 2.4.2.  File an IG complaint at any level without going through their supervisory channel. 2.4.3.  File a complaint with an IG without fear of reprisal. 2.4.4.  Request withdrawal of their IG complaint in writing; however, IGs may still examine the issues at their discretion and treat it as a third-party complaint. 2.4.5.  Request  the  next  higher-level  IG  review  their  complaint  within  90  days  of  receiving the  IG  response.    However,  simply  disagreeing  with  the  action  taken  will  not  justify additional IG review.  The request for review must: 2.4.5.1.  Be  in  writing  and  give  specific  reasons  why  the  complainant  believes  the original IG complaint resolution was not valid or adequate.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 43 2.4.5.2.  Provide  additional  information  to  justify  a  higher-level  review  on  previously considered issues. 2.4.5.3.  When  a  complaint  is  referred  by  the  IG    to  an  agency  outside  of  the  IG, complainants  must  request  review  by  that  agency,  or,  if  appropriate,  the  next  higher organizational level within that agency. 2.4.6.  Submit  complaints  anonymously.    Additionally,  when  the  complainant's  identity  is known, the complainant may still select to be treated as anonymous filer when submitting the complaint. 2.4.6.1.  Complainants  who  do  elect  to  file  anonymously  will  be  treated  as  third  party complainants.  See paragraph 2.4.7. 2.4.7.  Submit a complaint if they reasonably believe inappropriate conduct has occurred, or a wrong or violation of law, policy, procedure, instruction, or regulation has been committed, even if the complainant is not the wronged party or was not affected by the alleged violation. Individuals may also submit a complaint on behalf of another individual.  Those who do so are known as third-party complainants. 2.4.7.1.  Third-party complainants  are not  entitled to  a response regarding the substance of alleged wrongs not directly affecting them.  Third-party complainants are only entitled to have receipt of their complaint acknowledged. 2.4.7.2.  Third-party  complainants  are  not  entitled  to  personal  information  or  other information  not  releasable  to  the  public  under  the  FOIA/Privacy  Act  (PA).    To  release personal information concerning a first-party individual (complainant, subject), a written and  signed  consent  to  release  private  information  must  be  acquired  from  the  affected individual.    (T-2).    If  the  individual  does  not  give  their  consent  to  release  first-party information  to  a  third  party,  IGs  must  inform  the  requestor  that  personal  privacy information will not be released.  See Chapter 13 for additional release information. 2.4.8.  Request whistleblower protection under 10 USC 1034 if they believe they have been reprised against for making or preparing a protected communication.  Refer to Chapter 6 for more specific information regarding reprisal complaints 2.4.9.  File complaints with allegations that have been previously investigated and reviewed by  a  higher-level  IG  office.    If  the  current  complaint  does  not  provide  new  information  or evidence that justifies further investigation, it will be dismissed. 2.4.10.  Address their complaints to the host wing IG if their unit does not have an appointed IG. 2.4.11.  Contact an IG or Member of Congress regarding any issue 2.5.  Complainant’s Responsibilities. 2.5.1.  Under  normal  circumstances,  complainants  must  submit  IG  complaints  within  one- year of learning of the alleged wrong.  Normally, complainants will prepare, sign, and submit to an IG an AF Form 102 to ensure awareness of the Privacy Act and their responsibilities.  Complainants  making  verbal  or  telephonic  complaints  should  normally  return  a  completed AF Form 102 to an IG within 5 calendar days.  Complaints not submitted on an AF Form 102 should be drafted following the same format outlined in Table 2.1, steps 3, 4 and 5.  44 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 2.5.2.  Time limit:  Complainants must submit IG complaints in a timely manner in order for the  IG  to  resolve  them  effectively.    An  IG  is  not  required  to  look  into  a  complaint  if  the complainant  has  failed  to  present  the  matter  to  an  IG  within  one  year  of  learning  of  the alleged  wrong.    IG  complaints  not  reported  within  one  year  may  seriously  impede  the gathering of evidence and testimony.  The IG may dismiss a complaint if, given the nature of the  alleged  wrong  and  the  passage  of  time,  there  is  reasonable  probability  insufficient information  can  be  gathered  to  make  a  determination,  and/or  no  special  Air  Force  interests exist to justify investigating the matter.  See paragraph 3.26 and Table 3.12. 2.5.2.1.  IGs may accept and refer complaints that exceed the above time requirements if the  complaint  is  of  special  Air  Force  interest  or  the  complainant  is  able  to  demonstrate that  he/she  was  unable  to  meet  the  time  standards  due  to  unforeseen  or  extraordinary circumstance, and such circumstance justifies the delay. 2.5.3.  Cooperation.  Complainants must cooperate with IGs and IOs by providing factual and relevant  information  regarding  the  issues  and/or  allegations  (unless  exercising  Article  31, UCMJ, or Fifth Amendment rights).  If complainants do not cooperate, the IG may dismiss the  complaint  if  the  IG  is  unable  to  conduct  a  thorough  complaint  analysis  due  to  lack  of information. 2.5.3.1.  Complainants  will  normally  be  allowed  at  least  5  calendar  days  to  provide requested  information  prior  to  the  IG  dismissing  their  complaint.    If  a  complaint  is dismissed,  and  complainant  later  files  the  same  complaint  issues,  the  complaint  will  be accepted as a new complaint (i.e., with a new ACTS number). 2.5.4.  Truthfulness.    Complainants  providing  information  to  the  Air  Force  IG  system  must understand  they  are  submitting  official  statements  within  official  Air  Force  channels.  Therefore,  they  remain  subject  to  punitive  action  (or  adverse  administrative  action)  for knowingly  making  false  statements  and  for  submitting  other  unlawful  communications.  Additionally, unless otherwise protected by law, any information complainants provide to the IG is subject to release during or after the IG inquiry. 2.6.  Removing Complaints from the IG System. 2.6.1.  Complainants  may  elect  to  withdraw  a  complaint,  in  writing,  from  IG  channels  and then submit it to supervisory channels for resolution.  However, IGs may elect to address the complaint  if  the  allegations  identify  a  wrong  or  a  violation  of  law,  policy,  procedure, regulation or other recognized standard.  EXCEPTION:  Allegations of reprisal or restriction must be resolved within IG channels.   (T-0). 2.6.2.  Unless there is evidence of  mishandling by the appropriate grievance agency/channel, IGs will refer complaints that belong in another Air Force investigative or grievance channel.  See  paragraph  3.16  and  Table  3.6  for  assistance  in  determining  if  a  complaint  belongs  in other channels. 2.6.2.1.  Inform the complainant of the alternatives and advise the complainant it would be appropriate to submit their complaint in that channel. 2.6.2.2.  IGs  may  refer  a  complaint  even  if  the  complainant  disagrees  with  the  referral.  Such referrals may include, but are not limited to:  allegations of crimes, notice of danger  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 45 to  people  and/or  property,  personnel  matters,  and  problems  with  potential  impact  on national defense. 2.7.  Requests to Delay Command Action. 2.7.1.  IGs  cannot  delay  command  and  personnel  actions  regarding  a  complainant  based  on the filing of an IG complaint or the initiation of an IG investigation.  Filing an IG complaint will not delay or prevent completion of command actions such as reassignment, retirement, discharge,  nonjudicial  punishment,  etc.,  unless  deemed  necessary  by  appropriate commanders. 2.7.2.  IGs  do  not  have  the  authority  to  place  individuals  on  administrative  hold.    The authority to place an individual on administrative hold or to delay command action rests only with commanders and the respective personnel center.  Therefore, complainants must submit such requests through their respective commander or servicing personnel office. Section 2C—How to File an IG Complaint 2.8.  Procedures for Filing an IG Complaint. 2.8.1.  Complainants  may  file  complaints  anonymously  through  an  IG  FWA  Hotline,  the Defense Hotline, or directly with an IG. 2.8.2.  Complainants should follow the steps in Table 2.1 and complete an AF Form 102, IG Personal  and  Fraud,  Waste  and  Abuse  Complaint  Registration,  prior  to  filing  a  complaint with the IG office. 2.8.3.  Complaints not  submitted on an AF Form  102 should be drafted  following the same format  outlined  in  Table  2.1,  steps  3,  4  and  5.    Complaints  not  submitted  in  the  outlined format  may  cause  a  delay  in  the  processing  of  the  complaint  and  the  determination  of  IG action. Table 2.1.  How to File a Complaint. Step  Action 1 If unable to resolve the complaint in supervisory channels, review Table 3.6 to determine if the complaint should be filed with the IG.  Complainants should file a complaint if they reasonably believe inappropriate conduct has occurred or a violation of law, policy, procedure, instruction, or regulation has been committed. Complete the personal data information on an AF Form 102 (typed or printed legibly), the preferred format for submitting complaints so it may easily be reproduced. Briefly outline the facts and relevant background information related to the issue or complaint on the AF Form 102 in chronological order.  The complainant should include witnesses who can corroborate the allegations or provide additional evidence relevant to the issues.  The complainant is responsible for describing what each recommended witness can provide regarding the issues and/or allegations.  2 3  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 List the issues and/or allegations of wrongdoing BRIEFLY, in general terms, and provides supporting narrative detail including chronology and documents later when interviewed.  Allegations should be written as bullets and should answer: 1.  When did the issue occur? 2.  Where did the issue occur? 3.  Who took the action in question 1. (e.g., Maj John A. Smith, XXSQ/CC)? 4.  What did the person (or people) in question 3. do (e.g., gave a letter of reprimand, wasted resources)? 5.  To whom did the action in question 4. happen (e.g., complainant, SSgt Smith, etc.)? 6.  What law, regulation or policy was violated (e.g., AFI 36-2803, 10 U.S.C, etc)? 7.  What remedy is being sought? If more than one year has elapsed since learning of the alleged wrong, the complaint should also include: 1.  The date the complainant first became aware of the conduct. 2.  How the complainant became aware of the conduct. 3.  Why the complainant delayed filing the complaint. Submit the completed AF Form 102 to any Air Force IG and set up a follow-on meeting to discuss the complaint. If an IG is named in the complaint, contact the next higher-level IG. 46 4 5 6 7  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 47 Chapter 3 MANAGING IG COMPLAINTS Section 3A—Introduction to the Complaints Resolution Process 3.1.  Overview.  This  chapter  instructs  IGs  at  every  organizational  level  how  to  manage  and process  IG  complaints  and  discusses  the  complaint  lifecycle  from  receipt  through  resolution.  The  Air  Force  endorses  a  proactive  oversight  and  follow-up  system  that  achieves  the  high program  standards  described  in  the  President’s  Council  on  Integrity  and  Efficiency,  Quality Standards for Federal Offices of Inspector General. 3.2.  Key    Terms.  This  section  uses  the  following  key  terms:    allegation,  complainant, complaint,  complaint  analysis,  complaint  resolution  process  (CRP),  confidentiality,  contact, referral  completion  report  (RCR),  self-investigation,  thoroughness,  and  timeliness.    Refer  to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms. 3.3.  Protection  of  Information.  A  key  goal  of  the  Inspector  General  CRP  is  to  facilitate  a complaints resolution environment that promotes confidence in Air Force leadership.  Assurance that  an  individual's  privacy  will  be  safeguarded  to  the  maximum  extent  practicable  encourages voluntary  cooperation  and  promotes  a  climate  of  openness  in  identifying  issues  requiring leadership  intervention.    Specifically,  the  IG  has  the  responsibility  to  safeguard  the  personal identity and complaints of individuals seeking assistance or participating in an IG process, such as  an  investigation.    (T-1).    While  this  does  not  mean  communications  made  to  an  IG  are privileged or confidential, it does mean disclosure of those communications (and the identity of the communicant) should be strictly limited to an official, need-to-know basis.  This information should  not  be  disclosed  unless  required  by  law  or  regulation,  when  necessary  to  take  adverse action  against  a  subject,  or  with  the  approval  of  The  Inspector  General  (SAF/IG),  or  IAW paragraph 3.3.2.  See Chapter 13 for guidance on the Air Force IG Records Release Program. Persons  who  request  anonymity  or  who  express  a  concern  about  confidentiality  must  be informed of this policy.  (T-1).  All  personnel  reviewing or processing  IG information  shall be briefed on this policy.  (T-1).  All IGs and staff members are obligated to protect IG information when  their  tenure  of  service  as  an  IG  is  completed.    The  following  guidance  applies  to  all personnel at all organizational levels: 3.3.1.  IG personnel must protect the identity of all complainants as described in paragraph 3.3. (T-0).   At the time the IG receives a complaint, they will advise the complainant: 3.3.1.1.  In  accordance  with  The  Inspector  General  Act  of  1978,  as  amended  by  The Inspector  General  Reform  Act  of  2008,  Title  5,  Appendix  3,  Section  7;  Complaints  by Employees, Disclosure of Identity, Reprisals. 3.3.1.1.1.  The  Inspector  General  may  receive  and  investigate  complaints  or information from an employee of the establishment concerning the possible existence of an activity constituting a violation of law, rules, or regulations, or mismanagement, gross  waste  of  funds,  abuse  of  authority  or  a  substantial  and  specific  danger  to  the public health and safety.  48 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 3.3.1.1.2.  The Inspector General shall not, after receipt of a complaint or information from  an  employee,  disclose  the  identity  of  the  employee  without  the  consent  of  the employee,  unless  the  Inspector  General  determines  such  disclosure  is  unavoidable during the course of the investigation and/or complaint analysis.  (T-1). 3.3.1.1.3.  Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or  approve  any  personnel  action,  shall  not,  with  respect  to  such  authority,  take  or threaten to take any action against any employee as a reprisal for making a complaint or disclosing information to an Inspector General, unless the complaint was made or the  information  disclosed  with  the  knowledge  that  it  was  false  or  with  willful disregard for its truth or falsity. 3.3.1.2.  If  a  complaint  is  more  appropriate  for  other  channels,  the  IG  will  refer  the complaint.  (T-1). 3.3.1.2.1.  Even  if  the  complainant  disagrees  with  referring  the  complaint,  the complaint may still be referred for action. 3.3.1.2.1.1.  The referral may require release of the complainant’s identity so the referral agency can effectively work to resolve the issue. 3.3.2.  IGs/IOs  should  not  divulge  a  complainant's  name  to  a  subject  or  to  any  witness,  or permit a witness to read the complaint without the Appointing Authority's written permission (reference paragraph 3.40.8). 3.3.2.1.  IOs  will  advise  witnesses  in  an  investigation  of  the  general  nature  of  the allegations under investigation.  (T-1).  To the maximum extent possible, the IO should protect the identifying information of complainants, subjects, and suspects. 3.3.2.2.  IOs will advise subjects or suspects of the allegation(s) under investigation.  (T-1).  The IO will read the allegations verbatim to the subject/suspect. 3.4.  Policy on Managing IG Complaints. 3.4.1.  IG  complaints  will  be  managed  in  a  manner  that  facilitates  efficient  and  effective mission  accomplishment.    (T-1).    IG  complaints  will  be  reported  and  resolved  with  due diligence and in a timely manner.  (T-1).  IGs at all organizational levels must document all complaints  and  adhere  to  the  process  timeline  outlined  in  Table  3.1.    (T-1).    Complaints within  the  purview  of  the  IG  CRP  should  be  addressed  at  the  lowest  appropriate  level, including  high-level  complaints  (e.g.,  those  sent  to  the  President,  Congress,  DoD,  SECAF, SAF/IG). 3.4.1.1.  This  ensures  the  higher-level  IGs  remain  unbiased  and  are  available  to  review any rebuttals or appeals of the lower-level investigations or actions. 3.4.2.  IGs should resolve complaints at the lowest possible level, but may elevate complaints when appropriate.  IGs must elevate complaints when self-investigation or the perception of self-investigation is an issue. 3.4.3.  Complaints against senior officials will be processed IAW Chapter 4.  (T-1). 3.4.4.  Complaints  against  colonels  (or  civilian  equivalents)  will  be  processed  IAW Chapter 5.  (T-1).  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 49 3.5.  The Complaint Resolution Process.  To assist IGs in managing complaints, the following table  describes  actions  required  to  resolve  a  complaint  from  receipt  through  investigation  to closure.    The  process  contains  15  steps  and  is  divided  into  3  phases:    complaint  analysis, investigation, and quality review.  The goal is for 95 percent of all cases to be resolved according to the guidelines described in Table 3.1.  For example, the goal for completing dismissal cases is 29 days (contact, 5 days; conduct complaint analysis, 20 days;  close  case, 4 days).  (T-1).  For Air  National  Guard  and  Air  Force  Reserve  IGs:    To  meet  the  goal  to  resolve  all  case  matters promptly, Phase 1 actions need to be completed no later than the end of the next Unit Training Assembly  (UTA)  after  receipt  of  the  complaint.    Timelines  for  congressional  inquiries  are different than listed here.  See Chapter 8 for more information. Table 3.1.  The Complaint Resolution Process (T-1).

Phase 1:  Complaint Analysis Phase Section 3B—Step 1:  Contact (< 5 Days) 3.6.  Key Terms.  This section uses the following key terms:  complaint, complaint clarification, contact, and senior official.  Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms. 3.7.  Policy  on  Receiving  Complaints.  Air Force, Air National  Guard, and Air Force Reserve IGs  receive  and  process  complaints  from  any  source  (including  anonymous),  via  any  medium, regarding  operations,  organizations,  functions,  and  personnel.    IGs  can  accept  telephonic  and verbal  complaints,  but  every  attempt  should  be  made  to  obtain  a  written  complaint.    For telephonic  and  verbal  complaints,  IGs  should  obtain  adequate  information  for  clarification  and follow-up actions.  IGs will enter all contact/complaint data into ACTS within 5 calendar days of initial contact (or by the conclusion of the next UTA for the ARC).  (T-1).  Reporting procedures in paragraphs 3.55 and 3.56 of this instruction must be followed until the case is closed. 3.8.  Complaint  Clarification  Procedures.  Thoroughly  understanding  a  complaint  is  the foundation  for  conducting  a  complete  and  accurate  complaint  analysis.    The  IG  will  conduct  a complaint clarification using the procedures in Table 3.2.  (T-1).  Fully document the contact in ACTS. 3.8.1.  All IGs receiving complaints that allege wrongdoing or misconduct to be addressed in IG channels will complete a complaint clarification interview.  It is highly recommended that this  interview  be  recorded  so  that  it  is  available  for  verbatim  transcription  if  needed  for analysis  and  report  documentation  later  during  the  inquiry  process.    In  the  absence  of  the ability  to  transcribe  the  complaint  clarification  interview,  the  IG  may  summarize  the testimony  using  the  recorded  interview  and  request  the  complainant  certify  the  IG’s  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 51 summarized  complainant’s  testimony  as  accurate.  Additionally,  if  the  IG  is  unable  to complete  a  complaint  clarification  interview  with  the  complainant,  the  complainant  will  be asked  to  complete  an  AF  Form  1168  Sworn  Statement  detailing  his  or  her  testimony.  Complainant clarification interviews are not required for allegations being referred outside of IG channels, transferred to another Air Force IG, or those addressed through assistance. Table 3.2.  How to Conduct a Complaint Clarification. Step  Action 1 2 Find a private location if the complaint is made in person. If the complainant has not yet done so, ask them to complete the complainant portion of an AF Form 102.  (T-1). Find out if the complaint was previously filed with another agency or individual. If the complainant has not talked to their supervisory channel, find out why.  Unless circumstances warrant otherwise, encourage the complainant to attempt resolution in supervisory channels first.  Explain why this is the preferred approach (faster resolution, commanders have the authority to remedy the situation, etc.).  Explain if the matter is clearly a commander issue and not an IG issue, the complaint should be referred to supervisory channels regardless of the desires of the complainant (refer to paragraph 3.3.1.1). Determine if the individual has sought assistance from an appropriate support agency (for example military personnel section, finance, or equal opportunity office). Advise them to go to that agency if they have not. If it has been more than one year since the complainant learned of the alleged wrong, inform them the complaint may be dismissed.  Explain that complaints are reviewed for dismissal on a case-by-case basis and the length of time since the alleged event can seriously impede the effectiveness of an investigation.  Ask the complainant why they delayed filing the complaint and if there were compelling circumstances. Ask the complainant to clarify his/her allegations and provide a chronology, as necessary.  Generally, a statement of fact must identify the nature and substance of the alleged wrong with sufficient detail and facts to enable the IG to ascertain what potential violations may have been committed.  The complainant should also identify the source (for example, the documents or names of witnesses who can corroborate the allegations); the date; and the act or condition that occurred or existed at that date.  If the complainant alleges reprisal or restriction, explain the whistleblower protection afforded by 10 USC 1034. Advise the complainant any records or documents he/she provides to the IG become part of an IG record and are not returnable. Ask the complainant what remedy is being sought.  Advise complainant the IG does not have the authority to direct actions to initiate remedy sought by complainant. Explain the steps involved in processing an IG complaint and/or conducting an investigation. Inform the complainant when you expect to get back to him/her (normally this will be an interim reply). 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  52 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 3.9.  Administrative  Procedures  for  Processing  Complaints.  IGs  will  log  all  contacts  in ACTS and follow the administrative procedures in Table 3.3 to process complaints made to their office.  (T-1). Table 3.3.  Processing Complaints. Step  Action 1 2 3 Log complaint into the ACTS database (NOTE: ACTS Case Notes should contain a complete description of the facts, sequence of IG actions taken, record of persons/organizations contacted, and date contact was made.) Mark/type/insert text, “COMPLAINANT PROVIDED”  on each page of documents provided by the complainant. Load as a printable document file (PDF) attachment to the ACTS case file and put a check mark in the “complainant provided” box.  (T-1). Contact complainant in writing, by telephone, or in person within 5 duty days to acknowledge receipt (unless received directly from complainant).  (T-1).  Provide an periodic update to the complainant 60 days after receipt of the complaint and every 60 days (For ANG/Air Force Reserve: every other UTA weekend) thereafter until a final response is provided.  (T-1).  Log the periodic update  in ACTS on the Suspenses Tab and add a case note.  (T-1). Section 3C—Step 2:  Analysis (< 20 Days) Conducting a Complaint Analysis 3.10.  Key  Terms.  This  section  uses  the  following  key  terms:  appointing  authority,  assist, complaint  analysis,  criminal  offense,  dismiss,  frivolous  assertion,  investigating  officer  (IO), investigation,  referral,  and  transfer.    Refer  to  Attachment  1  for  the  definition  of  these  key terms. 3.11.  Policy  for  Complaint  Analysis.  In  each  case,  IGs  at  every  organizational  level  will conduct  a  thorough  complaint  analysis  to  determine  the  appropriate  complaint  resolution strategy.   (T-1).   A  complaint analysis is  always required  and results in:   assistance, dismissal, investigation,  referral  or  transfer  of  the  complaint.    Complaints  containing  multiple  assertions may require multiple resolution strategies, i.e., referral, dismissal and/or investigation.  For every contact,  document  the  rationale  for  the  selected  resolution  strategy  in  ACTS  (see  template  at AFCRPSG attachment 1). 3.11.1.  When  complaints  have  different  resolution  strategies  (i.e.  assist,  referral,  and dismissal),  it  may  be  appropriate  to  create  an  additional  ACTS  case  for  each  resolution strategy. 3.11.2.  When transferring portions of contacts/complainants to different  MAJCOMs, create an additional ACTS entry for the transfer. 3.11.3.  All  IGs  during  the  complaint  analysis  process  will  consider  the  UPAs  and  PCs presented by the complainant in the complaint regardless of whether reprisal or restriction is raised.  (T-1). 3.12.  Conducting  a  Complaint  Analysis.  A  complaint  analysis  is  a  preliminary  review  of assertions and evidence to determine the potential validity and relevance of the issues to the Air  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 53 Force  and  to  determine  what  action,  if  any,  is  necessary  within  IG,  supervisory,  or  other channels. 3.12.1.  During complaint analysis, complaints of wrongdoing will be treated as issues until it is  determined  through  the  analysis  that  further  investigation  is  warranted.    (T-1).    If  a complaint  analysis  recommends  further  investigation,  the  IG  will  conclude  the  analysis  of each issue in the complaint analysis by framing a proper allegation for investigation.  (T-1).  If  the  complaint  analysis  recommends  dismissal,  in  that  an  investigation  is  not  warranted, then the IG will conclude the analysis of those issues as issues rather than allegations.  (T-1).  The  basis  of  this  is  two-fold.    First,  an  allegation  is  not  an  allegation  until  a  standard  is identified.    Secondly,  once  a  standard  is  identified  then  an  allegation  can  only  be Substantiated or Not Substantiated.  Since prima facie evidence should exist before framing an allegation against a subject or suspect, a properly framed allegation cannot be dismissed. 3.12.2.  A  properly  framed  allegation  is  a  factual  proposition  to  be  proved  or  disproved during  an  investigation,  and  which  if  true,  would  constitute  wrongdoing.    If  an  allegation cannot be properly framed, then an investigation is inappropriate.  Framed allegations must contain the following:  (T-1). 3.12.2.1.  When did the alleged violation occur? 3.12.2.2.  Who committed the alleged violation? 3.12.2.3.  What violation was committed? 3.12.2.4.  What law, regulation, procedure, standard, or policy was violated? 3.12.2.5.  A properly framed allegation is constructed as follows: When  (on  or  about  10  January  2004),  Who  (Major  John  A.  Smith,  XX  Sq/CC)  did what  (gave  a  referral  EPR  to  SrA  William  Tell),  in  violation  of  what  standard  (in reprisal  for  a  protected communication in violation of 10 USC 1034).  3.12.3.  Do  not  combine  allegations  to  simplify  the  process.    If  the  complainant  asserts multiple  violations  on  different  occasions,  make  each  of  these  a  separate  allegation.    The same rule applies when the complaint contains multiple subjects, occurrences, or standards. 3.12.4.  Refer  to  paragraph  6.6  when  conducting  a  complaint  analysis  into  allegations  of reprisal. 3.13.  Complaint Analysis Procedures.  Use the complaint analysis procedures in Table 3.4 to determine appropriate complaint resolution strategy. Table 3.4.  How to Conduct a Complaint Analysis. Step  Action If issues are appropriate for IG action but should be addressed by another IG, see paragraph 3.19 and Table 3.7.  If appropriate for transfer, follow the guidance in paragraph 3.20 and Table 3.8. Determine if the complaint is appropriate for IG channels.  See Table 3.6. 1 2  54 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Determine if the issues fall under the category of Special Interest Complaints in Table 3.5.  If issue  meets the criteria for a Special Interest Complaint, follow the directions in Table 3.5.  If the allegation does not meet the criteria, return to this table If the issues are not IG related and there is no allegation of a violation or wrongdoing, provide assistance as appropriate IAW paragraph 3.22 and Table 3.9. However, if the IG completing the case analysis determines the issue warrants an inquiry by the referral agency, see step 5 of this table to refer the issue. If issues are not IG related and there is an allegation of a violation or wrongdoing, follow the guidance in paragraph 3.24 and Table 3.10.  If referral is appropriate resolution strategy, follow the guidance in paragraph 3.25 and Table 3.11. Determine whether the issues are appropriate for dismissal.  See Table 3.12.  If appropriate for dismissal, follow the guidance in Table 3.13. Determine whether the issues asserted are appropriate for investigation.  See paragraph 3.30. Document the rationale for the selected complaint resolution strategy.  The complaint analysis documentation letter in AFCRPSG attachment 1 provides a template for documenting complaint analysis.  See paragraph 3.14. Document appropriate complaint information in ACTS, either by case note or as an attachment.  See paragraph 3.14. 3.14.  Documenting  a  Complaint  Analysis.  IGs and IG staff members at every organizational level will document each complaint analysis and include the rationale for the selected complaint resolution strategy.  (T-1). 3.14.1.  If,  during  the  initial  complaint  analysis,  the  IG  deems  the  complaint  should  be handled  by  another  IG  office,  contact  that  IG  office  and  discuss  rationale  of  potential transfer.   If transferred, the gaining  IG office will accomplish  a detailed  complaint analysis and required documentation.  (T-1). 3.14.2.  Document  the  complaint  analysis  (see  AFCRPSG  attachment  1,  for  example)  and attach the document to the ACTS case file.  (T-1).  For complaints that are resolved through an  assist,  dismiss,  transfer  or  referral,  the  IG  can  document  the  complaint  analysis  in  an ACTS case note in place of the complaint analysis documentation letter.  The case note must include the background, issues, analysis, and resolution path. 3.14.3.  If  the  complaint  analysis  recommends  an  IG  investigation,  the  complaint  analysis document must contain properly framed allegations.  (T-1). 3.14.4.  All  complaint  analyses  recommending  investigation  will  be  reviewed  by  the Appointing Authority.  (T-1). 3.15.  Processing  Allegations/Issues  of  a  Special  Nature.  Table  3.5  explains  special processing  instructions  when  a  complainant  makes  assertions  against  senior  officials,  colonels (or civil servant Grade 15), IGs, or allegations of a special nature.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 55 Table 3.5.  Processing Special Interest Complaints.  (T-1).  B Then… Report and transfer the entire case through the appropriate MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG to SAF/IGS by using AFCRPSG attachment 14 and reference Chapter 4. Report the allegations IAW paragraph 5.3 through the appropriate MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG to SAF/IGQ by using AFCRPSG attachment 15.  Follow the procedures in Chapter 5. After consultation and coordination with the next higher-level IG, transfer the complaint to the next higher-level IG for action and document as a transfer in ACTS. Advise complainants of whistleblower protection under 10 USC 1034.  Follow procedures in Chapter 6. Advise complainants of whistleblower protection under 10 USC 1034.  Follow the procedures in Chapter 7. Refer the complainant to the Equal Opportunity office for a complaint clarification following the procedures in Chapter 9. Consult with the JA and local AFOSI office to determine whether the allegations should be handled through command or law enforcement channels. A R U L E 1  Against a senior official If the complainant makes assertions… 2  Against a colonel (or civil servant Grade 15) 3  Against an IG 4  That a military member was reprised against for making a protected communication 5  That a military member was restricted. 6  Of violations of Military Equal Opportunity policy 7  Of fraud, espionage, sabotage, treason, subversion, disloyal statements, disaffection, or other criminal offenses (i.e., to include but not limited to homicide, sexual assault, use/possession/sale of drugs, theft, travel fraud, etc.) 3.16.  Other Agencies  and Grievance Channels.  DoD and Air Force policy mandates the use of specialized investigative agencies or procedures for certain types of complaints made against non-senior officials.  In these cases, complainants should be advised of the appropriate agency. Table 3.6 assists IGs in determining if a complaint belongs in other channels. 3.17.  Handling  Air  Force  Civilian  Complaints.  The  IG  CRP  does  not  cover  matters concerning  employment  conditions  for  civilian  employees.    These  matters  must  be  processed under  applicable  civilian  grievance,  complaint,  or  appeal  systems  as  stated  in  other  directives.  (T-1).  Refer to Table 3.6 for procedures for handling civilian complaints.   56 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 Table 3.6.  Other Agencies and Grievance Channels (T-1).

If  the  complaint  does  not  concern  reprisal  or  restriction  and  is  not  in  Table  3.6,  the complainant or complaint should normally be directed to command channels. Section 3D—Step 3:  Tasking: Transfer, Assist, Refer, Dismiss, or Investigate (< 4 Days) 3.18.  Key Terms.  This section uses the following key terms:  appointing authority, assist, case file, closure, colonel (or civil servant Grade 15), completion, dismiss, investigating officer (IO), investigation,  lieutenant  colonel  (or  below),  referral,  reprisal,  restriction,  senior  official,  self- investigation and transfer.  Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms. 3.19.  Transferring  a  Complaint.  A  complaint  is  transferred  when  the  complaint  analysis discloses  that  the  matter  is  appropriate  for  Air  Force  IG  action,  but  an  IG  other  than  the  one receiving  the  complaint  should  handle  the  matter.    IGs  will  comply  with  the  requirements  of Table 3.7 and paragraph 3.20 concerning the transfer of complaints to other IGs.  (T-1). Table 3.7.  When to Transfer A Complaint to Another Air Force IG (T-1). A If… R U L E 1  The subject is a senior official  The complaint is received by B And… any IG office other than SAF/IGS  C Then… Transfer the complaint to SAF/IGS via MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or 60 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 2  The complaint has not been addressed at the level where the alleged wrongdoing occurred The higher-level IG determines transfer to the lower-level IG is appropriate and no evidence of bias by lower-level IG exists 3  The complaint presents a conflict of interest for the Appointing Authority or IG 4  The subject is the IG’s commander or vice wing commander 5  The subject is an IG or an IG    staff member 6  The subject is assigned to AFOSI or the issue is related to AFOSI 7  The subject is assigned to a higher-level of the Air Force or MAJCOM other than the IG receiving the complaint 8  The complainant is assigned  to  the  host  wing, an  associate  unit,  or  is anonymous or a third-party is assigned  to  the  host  wing, an  associate  unit,  or  is anonymous or a third-party 9  The complainant The complaint is received by any IG other than SAF/IGQ The complaint is appropriate for IG action, but the alleged wrong happened in a unit under the other MAJCOM or higher IG’s jurisdiction The subject (person, process, or agency) is assigned to the host wing The subject (person, process or agency) is assigned to an associate unit DRU. Transfer the case to the lower-level IG. Transfer the complaint to the next higher-level IG. Transfer the complaint to the next higher-level IG. Transfer the complaint to the next higher-level IG. Transfer the complaint to AFOSI/IG via MAJCOM, JFHQ, NAF, or DRU . Transfer the complaint IAW Table 3.8 to the IG at the same level and command as the subject. The host IG will process the complaint and oversee or conduct the investigation (if required). Follow the guidance in paragraph 1.19.14. 3.20.  Procedures for Transferring a Complaint.  Use the procedures in Table 3.8 to transfer a complaint.  (T-1). Table 3.8.  How to Transfer a Complaint (T-1). Step  Action 1 Conduct a complaint analysis to determine if the complaint should be transferred to another  IG.    Do  not  make  any  notifications  regarding  reprisal  or  restriction  or colonels  (or  civil  servant  Grade  15).    These  notifications  will  be  done  by  the receiving IG. Coordinate a complaint transfer with the appropriate IG explaining the rationale for transfer.  If the transferring and receiving IGs do not agree whether a transfer is appropriate, elevate the case to the MAJCOM/IGQ office(s) for resolution.  SAF/IGQ will act as the MAJCOM for ANG cases. Notify the complainant of the transfer in writing and attach the response in ACTS. 2 3  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 61 4 5 6 Transfer case file to receiving IG office through the applicable MAJCOM, JFHQ, NAF, or DRU IG.  Transfers must be accomplished in ACTS.  If the complainant expresses concern about bias at a lower-level, advise him/her of the right to appeal the lower-level IGs finding and the fact that the higher-level IG oversees the action of lower-level IG. Document the case IAW paragraph 3.14.1 in ACTS as a “Transfer” and take other actions needed to ensure the ACTS record is transferred to the appropriate IG office.  The IG office which resolves the issue will close the case in ACTS at the appropriate time. 3.21.  Policy  When  Another  Appeal  or  Grievance  Channel  Exists.  When  a  member  has  a complaint or appeal regarding adverse actions for which law and/or regulation provide a specific means  of  redress  or  remedy,  IGs  will  advise  the  complainant  of  those  other  redress  or  appeal channels as provided for by the specific law or regulation.  (T-1).  Mere dissatisfaction with the outcome of an appeal is not sufficient basis for an IG inquiry. 3.21.1.  For complaints that are not appropriate for the IG CRP see  Tables 3.9,  3.10  3.11,  3.12 or  3.13 3.21.2.  IGs will assist or refer complaints when they fall under the purview of another office or agency, or when they are covered by other directives with established grievance channels IAW paragraphs 3.22 and  3.24.  (T-1). 3.21.3.  If  the  member  alleges  the  appeal  process  was  improperly  or  prejudicially  handled and  has  no  other  means  of  redress,  the  complainant  may  enter  a  complaint  of  mishandling under this instruction for IG complaint analysis. 3.21.4.  If the complainant makes an allegation that could be considered  a criminal offense, the IG will consult with JA and law enforcement to determine whether the complaint should be referred or remain in IG channels.  (T-1). 3.22.  Assisting  a  Complainant.  IGs assist  complainants in  resolving personal  problems  when there  is  no  evidence  or  assertion  of  wrongdoing.    Assistance  may  also  be  used  to  direct complainants  to  the  appropriate  grievance  channel  IAW  Table  3.6,  Note  2.    To  remedy  a problem,  IGs  may  make  phone  calls,  ask  questions  of  functional  experts,  solicit  helpful information from the appropriate organization or agency, or put the complainant in contact with the person, organization, or agency that can appropriately address their problem.  The purpose of assistance  is  to  quickly  resolve  personal  issues  and  allow  the  complainant  to  refocus  on  the assigned mission.  Table 3.9 explains when and how to assist a complainant. 3.23.  Procedures  for  Assisting  a  Complainant.  Use  the  procedures  in  Table  3.9  to  assist  a complainant.  (T-2). Table 3.9.  How to Assist a Complainant (T-2). Step  Action 1 2 Discuss concerns/issues with the complainant. Conduct a complaint analysis to determine if the complaint can be appropriately handled through assistance.  When complaints are more appropriately handled by another service IG (e.g. Army, Navy, Marine), handle those complaints as assists  62 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 except when the complaint asserts wrongdoing by an Air Force member.  In cases where subjects of complaints are Air Force members, transfer those complaints to appropriate AF IG office for resolution.  Document the complaint analysis using the complaint analysis documentation letter (AFCRPSG attachment 1) and attach the document to the ACTS case file or document the analysis in an ACTS case note (include all appropriate information as referenced in AFCRPSG attachment 1).  (T-1). Advise the complainant their complaint is not an IG matter but the IG can assist them in resolving their concerns. Make phone calls or other contacts to provide the complainant with assistance needed. Ensure the complainant’s concerns are being addressed by the appropriate authority/agency. Document the case IAW paragraph 3.14.1 in ACTS as an “Assist,” record appropriate information, and close the case. 3 4 5 6 7 3.24.  Referring  a  Complaint.  When  the  complaint  analysis  discloses  an  organization  or agency outside the Air Force IG Complaints Resolution system can more appropriately handle a complaint alleging a violation of instruction, policy, or procedure, IGs will refer the complaint to the  appropriate  organization  or  agency  following  the  procedures  described  in  Table  3.11  and paragraph  3.25.  When referring complaints,  IGs will  include the Referral  Completion Report (RCR)  template  (see  AFCRPSG  attachment  24)  with  the  complaint.    (T-1).    The  organization receiving  the  referral  will  complete  the  RCR  and  return  it  to  the  IG  within  30  days  of  receipt along with a courtesy copy of their response to the complainant. 3.24.1.  Ensure RCRs include:  (T-1). 3.24.1.1.  Scope of the inquiry. 3.24.1.2.  Findings of the inquiry. 3.24.1.3.  Conclusions, recommendations and corrective actions. 3.24.2.  Attach completed RCRs in ACTS under ”Disposition/Resolution Documents”. Table 3.10.  When to Refer A Complaint. A If… R U L E 1  The complaint is a matter not appropriate for the IG complaints resolution system 2  The complaint is a command issue (i.e., financial irresponsibility, adultery, etc.) B Then… Refer the complaint and the RCR template to the office having functional responsibility. Refer the complaint and the RCR template to the appropriate commander. 3.25.  Procedures  for  Referring  a  Complaint.  Use  the  procedures  in  Table  3.11  to  refer  a complaint,  and  AFCRPSG  attachment  2  for  a  sample  referral  letter,  but  do  not  attach  the  IG’s complaint analysis.  (T-1).  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 63 Table 3.11.  How to Refer a Complaint (T-1). Step  Action 1 Conduct a complaint analysis to determine if the complaint should be handled in other channels. Document the complaint analysis IAW paragraph 3.14.1 (see AFCRPSG attachment 1 for example) and attach the document to the ACTS case file.  The analysis may also be documented in an ACTS case note (include all appropriate information as referenced in AFCRPSG attachment 1).  The complaint analysis documentation letter (AFCRPSG attachment 1) provides the format. Notify the complainant of the intent to refer the complaint and request permission from the complainant to pass their name and contact information to the referral agency.  If the complainant refuses permission, inform the complainant that in certain cases, release of their personal information is integral to resolution of the complaint and communications between the complainant and the referral agency may be necessary to arrive at a desired outcome.  If the complainant still refuses, the IG will have to act as a conduit for questions from the referral agency and answers from the complainant.  At no time should a complainant’s identity be released to a referral agency without the complainant’s permission.  It is highly encouraged that this permission is received in writing (i.e. a letter or email or check box on AF Form 102). For all complaints, refer the complaint, in writing, to the appropriate agency, commander, or grievance channel using the Sample Referral Memorandum, AFCRPSG attachment 2.  DO NOT attach the Complaint Analysis.  Redact portions of the complaint that do not directly apply to the referral action.  Redact the complainant’s identity if the complainant has not given permission for the release (see step 3 of this table).  Include a copy of the RCR template, AFCRPSG attachment 24.  RCRs are not included when referring complaints to EO or OSI.  Notify the complainant, in writing, of the referral. Direct the referral agency to provide you a copy of the finished RCR, any completed investigations in response to the referral where not prohibited by law, and a courtesy copy of the closure response to the complainant for your case file (Note 1).  IGs will follow-up with the referral agency within 30 days if a closure response has not been received.  (T-1). 2 3 4 5  64 6 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 If Command conducts a commander-directed investigation or inquiry (CDI) based on a complaint received by an IG then the following are required prior to IG closing the case:  1.  Copy of CDI report (case file and all attachments)  2.  Copy of legal review (if accomplished)  3.  Copy of the final command actions (including non-judicial punishment, an LOR, an LOA, an LOC, a Record of Individual Counseling, or a memorandum documenting verbal counseling of the subject)  4.  Copy of any rebuttal or statement provided by the subject     If Command conducts a Commander’s inquiry with no documentation or report based on a complaint received by an IG then the following are required prior to IG closing the case:  1.  A memorandum, signed by the commander, outlining how the allegations were addressed .  The RCR may suffice if signed by the commander and containing the necessary detail. 2.  Copy of legal review (if accomplished)  3.  Copy of the final command actions (including Article 15s, LORs, punitive LOCs, LOAs, memorandums counseling the subject, or a memorandum documenting verbal counseling of the subject)  4.  Copy of any rebuttal or statement provided by the subject 7 Document the case in ACTS as ”Refer,” record appropriate information, and place the case in complete status.  If there is an O-6 subject, ensure SAF/IGQ is notified IAW paragraph 5.6.  Additionally, if there is an O-4 or O-5 subject, monitor/track the case until completion.  .  See AFCRPSG Attachment 28, Notification Memorandum for Reporting Substantiated Findings and/or Adverse Information Against majors or lieutenant colonels.  When a copy of the RCR and other documents as required in Step 6 are  provided to the IG, close the case in ACTS.  (Note 2)  For referrals to EO or OSI, after confirming EO or OSI has accepted the case, make a case note and close the case. Note  1.    SAF/IGS  will  not  normally  send  a  closure  response  to  the  complainant  on  referred matters.  Note 2.  If the complainant notifies the referring IG that he/she did not receive a final response from  the  referral  agency,  the  IG  should  follow-up  to  ensure  the  referral  agency  received  the complaint and provided a response to the complainant.  3.26.  Dismissing a Complaint.  A complaint may be dismissed following a thorough complaint analysis if there is no assertion or evidence of a standard being violated or when the complaint falls under one of the rules in Table 3.12.  Tables 3.12 and  3.13 help IGs determine when and how to dismiss a complaint.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 65 Table 3.12.  When to Dismiss a Complaint (T-1). A If… B And… C Then… Dismiss the complaint. Dismiss the complaint. Dismiss the complaint. (Note 1) Dismiss the complaint. The complainant has exhausted procedural appeals with the administrative process and there is no evidence of a process problem. The IG determines: (a) there are no extraordinary circumstances justifying the delay; and/or (b) there is no special AF interest in the matters alleged; and (c) given the nature of the alleged wrong and the passage of time, there is reasonable probability that insufficient information can be gathered to make a determination  If the complaint analysis reveals the complainant has not brought forth credible evidence of a violation of law, instruction, regulation, or policy The complaint is a matter not appropriate for the IG The complaint analysis discloses a matter within the IG’s purview, but the complainant did not contact the IG within one year of learning of the alleged wrongdoing (see paragraphs 2.5.1 and 2.5.2)  The complainant refuses to provide sufficient evidence to properly conduct the complaint analysis or fails to respond to requests for additional information within 5 days The complainant files a complaint under Article 138, UCMJ The Article 138 complaint addresses the same matters addressed in the IG complaint Dismiss the IG complaint. R U L E 1 2 3 4 5  66 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 6  After completing a thorough  Dismiss the complaint. complaint analysis, the IG determines the complaint cannot be referred and is: without merit; or frivolous; or that an IG investigation would not appreciably affect the outcome or remedy sought (Note 2) The complaint analysis discloses a matter within the IG’s purview, but the allegations have already been investigated and reviewed by higher-level IG office The complainant requests to withdraw the complaint 7 8 The complainant provides no new evidence or information that justifies further investigation Dismiss the complaint. There is no overriding Air Force interest in the complaint Dismiss the complaint. Note  1.    The most important consideration before dismissing a complaint based on the time requirement  established  in  paragraph  2.5.1  is  the  potential  to  gather  sufficient  information to  determine  the  facts  and  circumstances  surrounding  the  alleged  wrongdoing.    With  the passage  of  time,  it  becomes  increasingly  difficult  to  gather  relevant  evidence,  testimony, and  information  for  many  reasons.    For  example,  it  may  be  difficult  or  impossible  to collect  relevant  witness testimony if  the  witnesses  have moved, retired,  or  died.  In  addition, as  time  passes,  witnesses’  memories  may  fade  and  documents  are  destroyed  when  their retention  periods  expire.   The  IG may dismiss a complaint if, given the nature of the alleged wrong and the passage of time, there is reasonable probability insufficient information can be gathered to make a determination.  However, if it is possible to gather sufficient information, a further analysis may be warranted.  Note 2.  See definition of frivolous assertion in Attachment 1. 3.27.  How  to  Dismiss  a  Complaint.  Follow  the  procedures  in  Table  3.13  to  dismiss  a complaint.  (T-1). Table 3.13.  How to Dismiss a Complaint (T-1). Step  Action 1 2 Conduct a complaint analysis to determine if the complaint should be dismissed. Prepare a complaint analysis letter and supporting decision documents IAW paragraph 3.14.1, then attach the documents to the ACTS case file.   Use the complaint analysis documentation letter (AFCRPSG attachment 1) for cases involving reprisal or restriction; follow the guidance in Chapter 6 or 7 as appropriate.  For cases not involving reprisal or restriction, the analysis may also be documented in an ACTS case note (include all appropriate information as referenced in AFCRPSG attachment 1).  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 67 3 4 5 6 7 If the complaint analysis determined allegations against a colonel (or civil servant Grade 15) were obviously frivolous, then, IAW paragraph 5.4.1, the IG must notify the next higher-level IG for approval. For allegations of reprisal or restriction, refer to Chapters 6 or 7, respectively. Notify the complainant in writing of the dismissal ensuring the rationale for the dismissal is clearly communicated.  For allegations of reprisal or restriction  wait until IG DoD has agreed with the AF recommendation to dismiss prior to notifying the complainant. Advise the complainant of his/her right to appeal to the next higher-level IG and AFBCMR (or other appeal channels), if applicable. Document the case in ACTS as a “Dismiss,” record appropriate information, and close the case. 3.28.  Investigating a Complaint.  Investigate a complaint when a properly framed allegation is derived from the issues asserted or implied by the complainant and the IG determines that there is sufficient evidence collected during complaint analysis which indicates that an investigation is warranted.    Though  allegations  may  be  successfully  framed,  not  all  matters  are  appropriate  for the IG, nor are all matters relevant to the Air Force.  Most Air Force processes have embedded appeal procedures that provide complainants with due process.  Table 3.6 outlines matters that are not appropriate for the IG to investigate.  The complaint must be timely to ensure information is  available  to  support  the  investigative  process.    Refer  to  Table  3.14  when  initiating  an  IG investigation. 3.29.  Policy  for  Conducting  Investigations.  The decision to conduct an IG investigation will only be made after completing a thorough complaint analysis of all issues presented.  (T-1). 3.29.1.  IG  investigations  are  performed  to  address  complaints  by  checking  records, correspondence,  reviewing  applicable  instructions,  examining  material  evidence,  and interviewing  the  complainant,  subject(s),  expert  witnesses,  and  persons  having  direct knowledge  of  the  matter.    IAW  paragraph  3.34,  Policy  for  Appointing  an  Investigating Officer,  all  investigations  require  an  appointment  letter  (see  paragraph  3.35)  from  the Appointing Authority. 3.30.  Procedures  for  Tasking  an  Investigation.  Use the procedures in  Table 3.14 to task an investigation. Table 3.14.  How to Task an Investigation  (T-1). Step  Action 1 Using a complaint analysis, determine if the issues raised by the complainant warrant an IG investigation.  When an investigation is warranted the complaint analysis will determine which issues are to be investigated and properly frame allegations for each.  The appointed IO will use the framed allegations verbatim when conducting the investigation. 2 Prepare and forward a complaint analysis document and supporting decision documents to the Appointing Authority.    68 3 4 5 6 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 The Appointing Authority reviews the complaint analysis and supporting material to determine whether an investigation is warranted. The Appointing Authority directs an investigation by appointing an IO in writing (see paragraph 3.35). Follow appropriate notification procedures per paragraphs 3.32 and/or 5.6. The IG places the case in ”Under Investigation” status using the ”Investigate“ action in ACTS and continues to record appropriate information in ACTS until the case is closed. 3.31.  Higher Headquarters Taskings. 3.31.1.  When complaints are addressed to a higher-level IG office, that office will decide if tasking to a lower-level IG is appropriate by determining whether: 3.31.1.1.  The complaint was previously addressed and merits a higher-level IG review. 3.31.1.2.  There is a need to avoid the appearance of self-investigation at a lower level. 3.31.1.3.  There is evidence the lower-level IG or command may be biased. 3.31.2.  Absent any of the circumstances described in paragraph 3.31.1, the higher-level IG may task the lower-level IG for complaint resolution and response to the complainant.  This ensures the higher-level IG office remains unbiased and is available to review any rebuttals or appeals of the lower-level investigation. 3.32.  Notification  Requirements (or Below).  Table 3.15 describes the notification requirements when an IG investigation is started against a lieutenant colonel (or below).  (T-1). Investigations  on  Lieutenant  Colonels for Table 3.15.  Notification Matrix for Investigations on Lieutenant Colonels (or Below) (Complaint Analysis and Investigation Phases) (T-1). A If in the… R U L E 1  Complaint Analysis Phase B And… C Then… Complaint analysis identified the need for an IG investigation 1.  Appointing Authority directs an investigation by appointing an IO in writing (see AFCRPSG attachment 4). 2.  Appointing Authority notifies the subject’s commander in writing of the scope of the investigation in general terms.  (See AFCRPSG attachment 3). 3.  Commander notifies subject in writing. 4.  IG or IO notifies witnesses. 5.  IG notifies complainant. 6.  The IG places the case in ”Under Investigation“ status using the ”Investigate” action in ACTS and continues to record appropriate information in ACTS until the case is closed.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 69 2 Investigation phase Investigation is ongoing 1.  IO provides progress reports (PRs) to higher-level IG (if required) at suspense date and the 1st of each month until investigation is finished per paragraph 3.55.  Document in ACTS under Suspense Tab. 2.  IG provides periodic updates and interim response to complainant per paragraph 3.55.  Document in ACTS under Suspense Tab. Phase 2: Investigation Phase Section 3E—Step 4: Pre-fact Finding (< 5 Days) 3.33.  Key  Terms.  This  section  uses  the  following  key  terms:  investigating  officer  (IO)  and investigation plan.  Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms. 3.34.  Policy for Appointing an Investigating Officer (IO). 3.34.1.  An  appointment  letter  is  an  IO’s  authority  to  conduct  an  investigation:    swear  in witnesses, collect evidence, and examine/copy documents, files and other data relevant to the investigation. 3.34.2.  An  appointment letter  is  necessary  for  all  investigations,  including  those  conducted by an IG or IG staff member.  (T-1). 3.34.3.  An  IO  is  the  personal  representative  of  the  Appointing  Authority.    IOs  must  be impartial,  unbiased,  objective,  thorough,  and  have  the  availability  to  complete  the investigation. 3.34.4.  The  IO  must  be  a  field  grade  officer,  senior  NCO,  or  Air  Force  civilian  with  a substantial  breadth  of  experience,  exceptional  maturity,  and  demonstrated  sound  judgment.  (T-1). 3.34.4.1.  When no IO in the required grade is reasonably available for appointment, the Appointing  Authority  will  request  a  waiver,  in  writing,  from  the  MAJCOM/IG,  Deputy IG,  or  MAJCOM/IGQ.    (T-1).    MAJCOM/IG  is  the  waiver  authority  for  cases investigated  at  the MAJCOM level  and below.   SAF/IGQ will act  as the MAJCOM for ANG waivers.  The waiver request should describe the measures taken to locate an IO in the  required  grade  prior  to  requesting  the  waiver.    If  approved,  the  MAJCOM/IG  will document the waiver in writing.  Refer to AFCRPSG attachment 9 to determine where to place the document in the case file. 3.34.5.  To  support  IO  impartiality  and  independence,  follow  either  of  the  two  subsequent paragraphs: 3.34.5.1.  There  must  be  at  least  one  level  of  command  between  the  IO  and  the complainant, and there  must also  be at  least  one level  of command between the  IO  and person(s) who are the subject(s) of the allegation(s).  (T-1).  70 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 3.34.5.2.  The IO must be separated by organizational assignment from the complainant, and the IO must also be separated by organizational assignment from the person(s) who are the subject(s) of the allegation(s).  (T-1). 3.34.6.  If  necessary,  an  IO  may  be  verbally  appointed;  however,  a  written  directive  must follow within three working days. 3.34.7.  The  investigation  will  be  the  IO’s  primary  duty  until  the  report  is  completed  and approved by the Appointing Authority.  (T-1). 3.34.8.  Appointing authorities should not appoint an IO who is retiring, separating, expects reassignment, or expects deployment within 180 days. 3.35.  How  to  Appoint  an  Investigating  Officer.  AFCRPSG  attachment  4  shows  a  sample letter  for  appointing  an  IO  to  conduct  an  investigation.    If  the  IG  assumes  the  role  of  the  IO, he/she  is  also  required  to  be  appointed  and  must  receive  an  appointment  letter  from  the Appointing Authority.  (T-1).  IGs who have been designated as the Appointing Authority cannot appoint  themselves  as  an  IO.    IGs  may  use  the  draft  investigative  plan  (see  AFCRPSG attachment 5 and paragraph 3.39.8) as the ”Directive to the IO“ shown as Attachment 1 in the IO appointment letter (see AFCRPSG attachment 4). 3.35.1.  The  IO’s  appointment  and  responsibilities  expire  when  the  report  of  investigation (ROI)  is  approved  by  the  Appointing  Authority  or  after  final  higher  headquarters  approval, whichever is later (see AFCRPSG attachment 4).  (T-1). 3.35.2.  The IO’s appointment and responsibilities will be renewed when there is a change of appointing authority.  (T-1). 3.36.  Requirements for Investigation Preparation. Inspector  General 3.36.1.  IGs will train IOs before they begin an investigation by using this instruction, the Air Force available  at https://golearn.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp  and  the  SAF/IGQ  Investigating  Officer Guide (IO Guide).  (T-1).  In addition, the IG will discuss the investigative requirements and answer questions. Investigating  Officer  Overview  course, 3.36.2.  IOs  must  confer  with  their  legal  advisor,  preferably  by  meeting  in  person,  before initiating the investigation.  (T-1).  The legal advisor will assist the IG in training the IO. 3.36.3.  IOs  must  review  the  allegations  and  supporting  documentation  as  part  of  their investigative preparation.  (T-1).  All appropriate regulations/directives should be identified and reviewed. 3.36.4.  Based  on  the  review  of  the  allegations,  supporting  documentation,  and  applicable directives,  the  IO  may  complete  an  investigation  plan,  which  will  be  approved  by  the  IG.  See AFCRPSG attachment 5 for a sample investigation plan.  This plan will assist the IO in completing progress reports and in keeping track of the dates he/she completes the planned actions. Section 3F—Step 5: Fact Finding (< 21 Days) 3.37.  Key  Terms.  This  section uses the following key terms:    authentication, evidence, hand- off,  interrogatories,  investigation,  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  proof  analysis  matrix,  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 71 statement, summarized testimony, suspect, subject, testimony, and witness.  Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms. 3.38.  Policy on Investigating Complaints. 3.38.1.  All  IG investigations are conducted  IAW  Chapter  3 and other applicable laws and regulations concerning the specific allegations. 3.38.2.  IG  investigations  are  administrative  in  nature--they  are  fact  finding  rather  than judicial proceedings.  The standard of proof that applies is proof by a preponderance of the evidence. 3.39.  IG Responsibilities.  IGs are responsible for managing the investigative process.  The IG must assist the IO in solving investigative challenges while managing the investigation’s quality and  schedule.    (T-1).    It  is  the  IG’s  responsibility  to  ensure  the  report  of  investigation  is completed on time and meets qualitative standards.  (T-1).  Specifically, the IG: 3.39.1.  Must  provide  the  IO  an  appointment  letter  describing  the  scope  of  investigation, authorizing the collection of evidence, and setting the suspense date for completion.  (T-1). 3.39.2.  Must provide the IO the complaint analysis, all complainant-provided materials, and the  framed  allegations.    (T-1).    Additionally,  the  IG  must  enter  all  allegations  addressed  in the ROI in the subject tab of the ACTS case file.  (T-1). 3.39.3.  Must  verify  the  IO  has  completed  the  Investigating  Officer  Overview  Course  (see paragraph 3.40.1) and train the IO using the SAF/IGQ IO Guide, and AFI 90-301.  (T-1). 3.39.4.  Must brief the IO on the Hand-off Policy.  (T-1). 3.39.5.  Must  schedule  appointments  with  key  support  staff  including  legal  and  technical advisors as necessary.  (T-1). 3.39.6.  Should  provide  the  IO  suitable  workspace,  computers,  administrative  support,  and technical assistance. 3.39.7.  Should  review  the  proposed  witness  questions  and  associated  rights  advisement,  if any. 3.39.8.  May  prepare  a  draft  investigative  plan  (AFCRPSG  attachment  5)  identifying  key milestones, standards, witnesses, evidence, and administrative requirements. 3.39.9.  May  prepare  a  preliminary  proof  analysis  matrix  facilitating  evidence  collection IAW the SAF/IGQ IO Guide. 3.39.10.  Has no authority to  grant express promises of confidentiality to  subjects, suspects, complainants, or witnesses. 3.40.  Responsibilities of IOs.  The IO: 3.40.1.  Must  complete  the  Air  Force  Inspector  General  -  Investigating  Officer  Overview Course,  available  at    https://golearn.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp  and  provide  the  local IG  a  copy  of  the  automated  Certificate  of  Training  prior  to  beginning  investigative  duties.  (T-1). 3.40.2.  Must advise the Appointing Authority immediately of any personal  relationships  or other factors that may affect his/her impartiality.  (T-1).  72 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 3.40.3.  Must  advise  the  Appointing  Authority  if  he/she  is  retiring,  separating,  expects reassignment, or expects deployment within 180 days.  (T-1). 3.40.4.  For ANG:  Must agree to be put on continuous orders for 30 days initially to conduct the  investigation.    Must  continue  on  orders  if  the  investigation  is  not  complete  within  30 days.  (T-1). 3.40.5.  Must  begin  the  investigation  without  any  preconceived  notions.    Never  take  sides with any party--be impartial, unbiased, and objective.  (T-1). 3.40.6.  Must investigate the complaint, not the complainant.  (T-1).  Keep the investigation focused on the allegations in the complaint and not the person making them.  (T-1). 3.40.7.  Must interview the complainant first in order to re-clarify the allegations and obtain specific details to help with the investigation.  (T-1). 3.40.8.  Must protect information IAW paragraph 3.3 and by:  (T-1). 3.40.8.1.  Obtaining  the  Appointing  Authority’s  written  permission  if  they  believe  they must release the complainant’s name to gain evidence or testimony. 3.40.8.2.  Reporting the results of the case only to the Appointing Authority and IG. 3.40.8.3.  Not commenting to any complainant, subject, or other witnesses regarding their opinions,  findings,  conclusions,  or  recommendations  during  or  after  completion  of  the investigation. 3.40.8.4.  Not providing copies of testimony to complainants, subjects, or witnesses.  If a subject/witness requests case file information, refer them to the appropriate FOIA office. 3.40.9.  Has  no  authority  to  grant  express  promises  of  confidentiality  to  subjects,  suspects, complainants, or witnesses.  (T-1). 3.40.10.  Should  not  take  leave  except  in  emergencies  or  be  involved  with  activities  that would interfere with the timely completion of the case. 3.40.11.  Must  consult  with  the  Appointing  Authority  and/or  supporting  IG,  legal  advisor, and read all applicable instructions and directives before beginning an investigation.  (T-1). 3.40.11.1.  Must  consult  in  advance  with  legal  advisor  about  the  need  for  rights advisement when applicable.  (T-1). 3.40.12.  Should  use  the  SAF/IGQ  IO  Guide  for  proper  guidance  on  how  to  conduct  an investigation. 3.40.13.  Should  complete  an  investigative  plan  identifying  key  milestones,  standards, witnesses, evidence, and administrative requirements and obtain IG approval. 3.40.14.  May  complete  a  proof  analysis  matrix  facilitating  evidence  collection  IAW  the SAF/IGQ IO Guide. 3.40.15.  Must verify the duty status of Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard personnel (witnesses, subjects, suspects, complainants) at the time of the occurrence and at the time of any scheduled interviews.  (T-1).  Consult with legal advisor if questions arise as to the duty status of the individual.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 73 3.41.  Gathering  Evidence.  Evidence  is  information  that  tends  to  prove  or  disprove  the existence  of  a  fact.    Evidence  comes  in  many  forms.    It  can  be  written  or  oral,  direct  or circumstantial, relevant or irrelevant, first-person or hearsay. 3.41.1.  Documentary  Evidence.    During  the  course  of  investigations  IOs  normally  collect copies  of  documents,  records,  and  other  physical  evidence  to  aid  them  in  their  duties. Assuming it is authentic, documentary evidence gives the investigator a snapshot in time. 3.41.1.1.  One way to further verify the authenticity of a document is to have it identified by  its  author,  especially  in  the  case  of  correspondence,  personal  notes,  and  computer records.    This  process  is  known  as  authentication  and  must  be  referenced  in  the  final report if the document has been so verified. 3.41.2.  Computer Records.  Data contained on computer hard drives, local area networks, e- mail  systems,  disks,  etc.,  are  considered  to  be  documentary  in  nature  but  pose  special challenges in accessing.  Obtaining access to this information should be coordinated through the servicing SJA office. 3.41.3.  Testimony.  The other major form of evidence is presented by a witness in the form of  testimony.    Normally,  the  bulk  of  evidence  during  an  investigation  is  collected  in  this format and will be discussed separately in this section. 3.41.4.  Hearsay.  A statement or testimony given by a witness who relates not what he/she knows personally, but what others have said and is therefore dependent on the credibility of someone other than the witness.  Although IOs may consider evidence obtained as hearsay, whenever  possible,  an  IO  should  always  try  to  talk  to  the  actual  witness  who  made  the statement, especially if they are reasonably available and the statement is important. 3.42.  Interviewing  Witnesses.  The  bulk  of  evidence  collected  during  IG  investigations  will normally  come  from  witness  testimony.    After  properly  framing  the  scope  and  purpose  of  the investigation,  the  next  most  important  aspect  is  the  preparation  of  intelligent,  well-planned questions.  Effective, cogent interviews can only be accomplished through thorough preparation.  IOs  should  consult  with  their  legal  advisor  when  formulating  interview  questions  and  should determine whether the legal advisor’s presence during interviews would be beneficial. 3.42.1.  A witness’ status will determine how they will be interviewed.  For example: 3.42.1.1.  The  complainant  is  a  key  witness  who  must  be  interviewed  first  to  clarify allegations and focus the investigation.  (T-1). 3.42.1.2.  The  subject  is  equally  important  since  he/she  is  the  one  against  whom  the allegations  have  been  made.    The  subject(s)  must  be  interviewed.    (T-1).    This  person should be interviewed last and given an opportunity to respond to the specific allegations against him/her.  Additionally, they should be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to significant adverse information that may come about subsequent to the subject’s initial interview.   If the subject is no longer associated with the Air Force, every attempt must be made to contact them to give them an opportunity to give their side of the story.  This process is also important to the complainant as a substantiated allegation may enable the complainant to correct their AF record and become whole again.  74 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 3.42.1.3.  An  expert  witness  is  someone  with  special  knowledge  and  expertise  in  a particular subject  matter.  They may be used as consultants for background information or as a regular witness during the investigation. 3.42.1.3.1.  Because of their special expertise, their testimony is normally given more weight than the testimony of non-experts in their area of specialty. 3.42.1.3.2.  IOs  should  not  allow  the  testimony  of  an  expert  witness  to  control  their final findings and recommendations.  This remains the ultimate responsibility of the IO. 3.42.1.4.  Character  witnesses  are  people  who  can  verify  the  reputation  of  a  particular person for certain conduct or personality traits, i.e., honesty, violence, etc. 3.42.2.  Regardless of their status, all witnesses in investigations must be sworn.  (T-1).  This puts  witnesses  on  notice  that  the  investigation  is  a  serious  matter  and  they  are  expected  to testify truthfully.  The IO must: 3.42.2.1.  For  each  witness  who  is  neither  a  suspect  nor  a  subject,  tailor  the  witness interview  format  outlined  in  AFCRPSG  attachment  6  as  appropriate.    Use  the individually-tailored  witness  interview  format  for  each  witness  interview.    (T-1).    For each  subject,  tailor  the  subject  interview  format  outlined  in  AFCRPSG  attachment  7  as appropriate and use it for that subject’s interview.  For suspect interviews, use the suspect interview format in AFCRPSG attachment 8 and guidance in paragraph 3.45. 3.42.2.2.  Advise  subjects/suspects  they  may  submit  additional  relevant  information  for the IO’s consideration within a reasonable time following their interview.  (T-1) 3.42.2.3.  Electronically  record  (audio  only)  all  witness  testimony  to  accurately  capture what was said during the interview.  (T-1).  Advise all witnesses they are not authorized to record the interview in any manner.  All electronic recordings must be given to the IG together with the completed ROI. 3.42.2.4.  Transcribe  verbatim  (word-by-word)  the  complainant’s,  subject’s,  and  key witnesses’  testimony.  (T-1).  At the discretion of the Appointing Authority, summarized testimony may be acceptable for all other nonessential witnesses. 3.42.2.5.  Sign  all  testimony  to  certify  its  validity.    Add  the  following  statement  to  the end  of  the  testimony:    ”I  certify  the  above  to  be  a  true  sworn  (or  affirmed)  testimony given to me on (date) at (place).”  (T-1).  It is encouraged (not mandatory) that witnesses also sign summarized testimony, whenever the witness is reasonably available to do so. 3.42.3.  For witnesses outside the local area, an IO can either travel to meet and interview the witness, or interview the witness telephonically.  If the witness is interviewed telephonically, the IO must make arrangements to verify the witness’ identity.  (T-1).  The appointed IO will (when possible) interview all subjects or suspects in person. 3.42.4.  If a witness’ status changes during the course of an investigation to that of a subject or suspect, the witness must be re-interviewed (following the format outlined in AFCRPSG attachment 7 or AFCRPSG attachment 8, as applicable) and given an opportunity to respond to the suspected misconduct or allegations in light of their new status.  (T-1).  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 75 3.42.4.1.  The  Appointing  Authority  will  determine  whether  additional  issues  will  be investigated  separately  and,  if  necessary,  expand  the  scope  of  the  investigation.    If  the scope  of  investigation  is  expanded,  an  addendum  to  the  appointment  letter  must  be completed.    (T-1).    The  IO  will  take  no  further  action  until  consulting  with  the Appointing Authority and the legal advisor.  (T-1). 3.42.4.2.  Conduct the proper read-in/rights advisement for a subject/suspect prior to the interview/re-interview.  (T-1).  Refer to paragraph 3.45 for further rules regarding rights advisement.  The read-in/rights advisement is mandatory.  Consult with the legal advisor prior to rights advisement. 3.42.5.  Witnesses  who  are  military  members  or  federal  civilian  employees  may  refuse  to testify only if they believe they might incriminate themselves (refer to paragraph 3.45).  If self-incrimination is not a concern, witnesses may be ordered/directed by their commander to testify.  Further refusal may be the basis for disciplinary action. 3.43.  Persons  Present  During  an  Interview.  A  typical  interview  will  involve  the  IO,  the witness/subject/suspect,  any  technical  advisor  (if  necessary),  and  the  legal  advisor  (if  deemed beneficial).    The  introduction  of  any  unauthorized  party  into  the  process  reduces  the  ability  to preserve a reasonable level of confidentiality. 3.43.1.  Only  a  suspect  has  the  right  to  have  an  attorney  present  during  an  interview; however, the attorney must not be allowed to answer any question for the interviewee.  (T-1). 3.43.2.  When witnesses are considered subjects, they may consult with an attorney, but may not have an attorney present during the interview.  (T-1). 3.43.3.  Union officials may have the right to be present during interviews per the provisions in paragraph 3.44 of this instruction.  (T-1). 3.44.  Civilian  Employees  Represented  by  Unions.  Civilian  employees  (including  non- appropriated  fund  employees)  may  have  a  right  to  union  representation  when  interviewed  as  a suspect, subject, or witness.  This right applies if the employee’s position meets the definition for inclusion in the collective bargaining unit.  The employee's status as a dues paying or non-dues paying  union  member  has  no  bearing  on  his  or  her  right  to  representation.    Additionally,  the union  has  an  independent  right  to  be  present  during  formal  discussions  (sworn/recorded  IG interviews  are  formal  interviews)  involving  bargaining  unit  members  and  if  the  discussion concerns a grievance (complaint by a bargaining unit employee about any term or condition of employment)  or  personnel  policy  or  practice  or  general  condition  of  employment.    The  union must be notified and given an opportunity to  attend whenever such formal  interviews will take place.  (T-1).  Presence by a union representative is a statutory right meant to protect the interests of  the  bargaining  unit  as  a  whole,  regardless  of  the  employee’s  wishes.    The  union  determines who will represent the union during the interview, not the employee and not the agency.  Before interviewing  witnesses,  subjects,  or  suspects  represented  by  unions,  consult  with  the  legal advisor  to  determine  what,  if  any,  rights  advisement  is  required  IAW  any  applicable  collective bargaining agreement. 3.44.1.  Weingarten  Rights,  per  the  Federal  Service  Labor-Management  Relations  Statute ("FSLMRS"  or  "Statute"),  created  a  right  to  union  representation  for  federal  civilian employees who belong to an appropriate bargaining unit.  This right arises during interviews with  a  federal  employee  in  connection  with  investigations  if:    (a)  the  employee  reasonably  76 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 believes disciplinary action may be taken against him or her as a result of the interview, and (b)  the  employee  requests  union  representation.    This  right  does  not  apply  to  management personnel. 3.44.2.  FSLMRS  does  not  require  an  IO  to  advise  an  employee  of  the  right  to  union representation  before  an  interview.    The  Statute  merely  requires  management  to  inform  its employees annually of this right unless the collective bargaining agreement provides that the IO will advise the employee of this right.  If the employee invokes Weingarten rights, the IO should consult with the legal advisor and civilian personnel office before proceeding with the interview. 3.44.3.  The  exercise  of  the  right  to  union  representation  may  not  interfere  with  the investigation.    Determinations  regarding  union  representation  should  be  coordinated  in advance with the legal advisor and the Civilian Personnel Office Labor Relations Specialist.  The  union  representative  is  a  personal  representative  of  the  employee  and  may  advise  the employee,  ask  questions  to  clarify  issues,  and  suggest  other  employees  who  may  have knowledge of the facts at issue.  However, he or she may not do so in a manner that interferes with  the interview and  may  not  testify for the  employee. The  IO has authority to  terminate the  interview  if  he  or  she  determines  the  union  representative  is  impeding  or  attempting  to impede the investigation.  Consult with the legal advisor on how to proceed after terminating the interview. 3.45.  Policy  Regarding  Rights  Advisements.  If  during  the  course  of  an  investigation  the  IO discovers information leading him or her to  believe matters of  a criminal  nature have occurred and  a  witness  or  subject  becomes  a  suspect,  the  IO  must  stop  the  interview,  consult  with  the Appointing Authority and legal advisor, and (if allowed to proceed) advise the suspects of their rights.   (T-1).  AFCRPSG attachment 8 provides a template format for a suspect interview and rights  advisement  and  must  be  read  to  the  suspect  verbatim.    If  after  rights  advisement,  the suspect refuses to testify or requests an attorney, then the interview must stop.  (T-1).  Consult with the legal advisor before attempting to re-interview the suspect. 3.45.1.  For active duty military suspects (and retired or separated military members subject to recall), advise them of their rights as specified under Article 31, UCMJ.  (T-0). 3.45.2.  In regards to Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard personnel, IOs need to verify the  status  of  the  suspect  at  the  time  of  the  occurrence  and  at  the  time  of  the  scheduled interview.  (T-1).  Consult with the legal advisor to determine what, if any, rights advisement is required. 3.45.3.  Civilian  witnesses,  even  if  suspected  of  a  criminal  offense,  need  not  be  advised  of their  Fifth  Amendment  rights  when  interviewed  as  part  of  an  IG  investigation.    Under  the law,  such  rights  are  only  required  in  conjunction  with  custodial  interrogations  (i.e., interrogations  in  which  the  interviewee  is  not  free  to  leave  at  will)  by  law  enforcement personnel.    Interviews  by  an  IG/IO  under  authority  of  this  instruction  do  not  meet  that threshold  requirement  (i.e.,  IGs  and  IOs  are  not  considered  law  enforcement  personnel  for Fifth Amendment purposes).  The lack of a requirement to advise civilian witnesses of their Fifth Amendment rights does not preclude them from invoking such rights if circumstances warrant.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 77 3.46.  Policy  Regarding  Subject/Suspect/Witness  Hand-offs.  Air  Force  policy  regarding investigative  interviews  of  Regular  Air  Force  personnel,  AFR  personnel,  ANG  personnel,  and Department of Air Force civilian employees requires special handling of certain interviewees: 3.46.1.  Air Force experience has found that subjects/suspects of an investigation may be at a greater risk of committing suicide.  A primary concern is that being a subject/suspect of an investigation may result in stress and turmoil within an individual’s life.  The hand-off policy is intended to act as a safety net to those individuals who might be so emotionally distraught as to pose a danger to themselves or others. 3.46.1.1.  These  hand-offs  require  person-to-person  contact  between  the  IO  and  the subject’s/suspect’s  commander  or  designee,  civilian  leading  an  organization  designated as  a  unit  IAW  AFI  38-101  or  designee,  first  sergeant,  or  supervisor.    Hand-offs  will require pre-coordination and advanced planning. initial interviews  with  Air  Force  personnel  who  are 3.46.1.2.  Following the subject/suspect of an investigation, IOs must refer such individuals to their commander or designee,  civilian  leading  an  organization  designated  as  a  unit  IAW  AFI  38-101  or designee,  first  sergeant,  or  supervisor.    (T-1).    The  command  representative  must  be physically present immediately following the interview and receive the subject/suspect. 3.46.1.3.  Before  providing  the  hand-off,  the  IO  should  advise  the  commander  or designee  that  the  individual  is  the  subject  or  suspect  of  an  IG  investigation.    The  IO should  also  explain  the  reason  for  any  concern  he  or  she  has  about  the  individual’s personal safety (e.g., individual was emotionally distraught, shocked, etc.). 3.46.1.3.1.  However,  the  IO  will  not  disclose  the  identity  of  the  complainant  or  the substance of testimony or other evidence obtained during the investigation.  (T-1). 3.46.1.3.2.  If time permits, the IO should coordinate with the IG before handing-off an  individual  or  notifying  the  commander.    However,  an  IO  should  not  delay obtaining  appropriate  assistance  for  an  individual  whose  emotional  state  demands immediate attention simply to obtain IG coordination. 3.46.1.4.  The hand-off must be documented at the end of the testimony.  (T-1).  IOs may use the documentation at the end of the readout or include the following annotation:  ”At the  conclusion  of  the  interview(s),  the  witness/subject(s)/suspect(s)was/were  handed  off by  the  IO  to  the  commander  (or  commander's  representative)  IAW  AFI  90-301, paragraph 3.46.” 3.46.2.  If any witness (or subject/suspect in subsequent interviews) appears to be emotional, distraught,  or  stunned  during  the  process  of  any  interview,  they  should  not  be  allowed  to depart  alone,  but  should  be  released  to  their  commander  or  designee,  civilian  leading  an organization designated as a unit IAW AFI 38-101 or designee, first sergeant, or supervisor, who will help ensure the individual receives the necessary support to safely handle his or her personal crisis (referred to as handing-off). 3.46.2.1.  In  most  instances,  hand-offs  will  require  pre-coordination  and  advanced planning. 3.46.2.2.  A hand-off is only required for witnesses if the IO determines the witness has been sufficiently disturbed by the interview to warrant person-to-person contact.  78 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 3.46.2.3.  The IO should also explain the reason for any concern he or she has about the individual’s personal safety (e.g., individual was emotionally distraught, shocked, etc.). 3.46.2.3.1.  However,  the  IO  will  not  disclose  the  identity  of  the  complainant  or  the substance of testimony or other evidence obtained during the investigation.  (T-1). 3.46.2.4.  The hand-off must be documented at the end of the testimony.  (T-1).  IOs may use the documentation at the end of the readout or include the following annotation:  ”At the conclusion of the interview(s), the witness/subject(s) was/were handed off by the IO to the commander (or commander's representative) IAW AFI 90-301, paragraph 3.46.” 3.46.3.  When  suspects,  subjects  or  witnesses  invoke  their  Fifth  Amendment  or  Article  31 rights  during  an  interview,  the  commander  or  designee,  civilian  leading  an  organization designated  as  a  unit  IAW  AFI  38-101  or  designee,  first  sergeant,  or  supervisor  will  be informed of this fact and  instructed to avoid any questioning, interrogation, or discussions in the  subject’s  presence  of  a  nature  likely  to  elicit  statements  or  admissions  regarding  the alleged offenses.  (T-0).  Document this in the Report of Investigation.  (T-0). 3.46.4.  If  subjects  are  represented  by  an  attorney  for  the  matter  under  investigation,  notify the  attorney  of  the  hand-off.    (T-1).    Notify  the  legal  advisor  of  any  suspect,  subject,  or witness represented by an attorney.  (T-1). 3.46.5.  When dealing with civilian witnesses, the IO must make a reasonable effort to hand- off  the  individual  directly  to  their  unit  representative,  commander  or  designee,  civilian leading an organization designated as a unit IAW AFI 38-101 or designee, or supervisor.  (T-1). Section 3G—Step 6: Writing the Report (< 37 Days) 3.47.  Key  Terms.  This  section uses the following key terms:   case file, completion, evidence, fact, hotline completion report, legal review, legal sufficiency, not substantiated, preponderance of  the  evidence,  report  of  investigation  (ROI),  standards,  substantiated,  and  technical  review.  Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms. 3.48.  Standard of Proof. 3.48.1.  The standard of proof applicable to IG investigations is proof by a preponderance of the evidence.  This means that it is more likely than not the wrongdoing has occurred. 3.48.2.  IOs must be careful not  to  apply this standard too  mechanically.   Quality counts as much as quantity and an IO may choose to believe one witness rather than five others if the one is sufficiently credible and the five are not.  In addition, there is no way to measure the weight of a document against the testimony of a witness other than by evaluating credibility as discussed in paragraph 3.49.2. 3.49.  Analyzing  the  Evidence.  Keeping in  mind the standard being sought  (preponderance of the  evidence),  IOs  will  follow  a  four-step  process  when  analyzing  the  evidence  they  collected.  (T-1). 3.49.1.  What  are  the  allegations?    Review  the  allegations  framed  prior  to  starting  the investigation.    Do  they  still  make  sense?    The  report  must  include  properly  framed allegations.  Consult  with the legal  advisor and  Appointing Authority if  allegations need to  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 79 be  revised  after  the  investigation  has  begun.    The  revision  may  require  notification  to  the subject/suspect, depending on the change and the stage of the investigation. 3.49.2.  What  are  the  facts  (what  happened)?    Facts  are  not  conclusions,  but  rather information and data, from which the IO must draw logical conclusions.  Each fact contained in the report of investigation must be supported by evidence contained in an exhibit attached to the report.  Facts are not always consistent and are often in dispute.  The IO is responsible for  determining  what  the  facts  were  at  a  specific  point  in  time.    He  or  she  evaluates  the credibility  of  witness  testimony  considering  factors  such  as  demeanor,  bias,  motive  to  lie, knowledge,  ability  to  observe,  recency  of  observations,  corroborating  evidence,  and  prior inconsistent  statements.    The  IO  must  analyze  the  available  evidence  and  use  the preponderance of the evidence standard to make the tough call and arrive at logical/concrete conclusions. 3.49.3.  What  standards  apply?    What  laws,  regulations,  policies,  or  other  controlling standards were allegedly violated?  Applicable standards should have been identified at  the beginning when framing the allegations.  The report should include a complete discussion of the standards in effect at the time of the alleged violation. 3.49.4.  Were the standards violated (was a rule, regulation, policy, or law broken)?  To reach a  conclusion,  the  IO  must  consider  and  discuss  the  credible  evidence  that  supports  or  does not support whether the subject violated a particular standard.  Utilizing the preponderance of the evidence standard, the IO concludes the allegation is or is not substantiated.  IOs should consult their legal advisor when in doubt about whether a particular action violated Air Force standards.  However, the final decision rests with the Appointing Authority during the final approval process. 3.50.  Category of Findings.  There are only two possible findings for each allegation: 3.50.1.  Substantiated:  A  substantiated  finding  results  when  a  preponderance  of  the evidence supports the allegation of a wrong or violation of law, regulation, procedure, or Air Force policy or standard.  The facts indicate a violation of standards occurred. 3.50.2.  Not Substantiated:  A not substantiated finding results when a preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion the alleged wrongdoing did  not  occur.   The facts  indicate no violation of standards occurred.  3.51.  Policy Regarding Report Writing. 3.51.1.  All  IG  investigations  (and  their  findings)  must  be  documented  with  objectivity, thoroughness,  and  in  a  timely  manner.    (T-1).    The  ROI  must  maintain  an  impartial  and balanced  tone  and  exclude  any  biases  for  or  against  the  complainant,  subject,  or  witnesses.  (T-1).  An ROI must be a stand-alone document—all the essential facts, documents, portions of regulations,  interviews, etc., must  be included in  the report so  a reviewer can arrive  at  a determination without reference to information outside the report.  (T-1). 3.51.1.1.  The IO must sign the report.  (T-1). 3.51.1.2.  The Appointing Authority approves the report in writing.  (T-1).  80 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 3.51.1.3.  The IO must address each of the framed allegations in the report.  (T-1).  If the Appointing  Authority  determines  an  allegation  should  not  be  examined  in  the investigation, the IO must document the Appointing Authority’s decision.  (T-1). 3.51.2.  Recommendations are optional  at  the discretion of the Appointing Authority.   If an IO is tasked to make recommendations, the recommendations are not binding. 3.51.2.1.  If requested, recommendations will be provided under separate cover and not as part of the ROI.  (T-3).  Refer to AFCRPSG attachment 9 to determine where to place the document in the case file. 3.51.2.2.  If the Appointing Authority  requests  recommendations, they should  be tied to the findings and stated as succinctly and objectively as possible.  IOs will not recommend specific command or administrative actions.  (T-3). 3.51.3.  IGs  will  refer  IOs  to  this  instruction  and  the  SAF/IGQ  IO  Guide  for  specific information and techniques on report writing.  (T-1). 3.51.4.  All IG investigative case files must comply with the standardized IG case file format described in paragraph 3.52 and  3.53, and AFCRPSG attachment 9.  (T-1). 3.52.  Case File Format.  A case file is a standardized compilation of documents relevant to an IG  complaint.    The  case  file  consists  of  three  sections.    Section  I,  the  Administrative  File,  is always  used  and  contains  documents  such  as  the  Complainant  Notification  Letter,  Progress Reports,  and  recommendations  if  requested.    The  documents  in  Section  I  are  solely  used  to supervise and manage the complaint resolution.  Section II, Report of Investigation, is the formal investigative report prepared by the investigating officer.  For example, this section contains the chronology,  background  and  allegations,  as  well  as  the  findings,  analysis,  and  conclusion.  Section II contains the bulk of the IOs work and is normally releasable under FOIA.  Section III, Support  Documents,  contains  all  the  supporting  evidence  associated  with  the  Report  of Investigation  and  additional  Quality  Control  Checklists.    The  witness  testimony,  documentary evidence, and the appointment letter are maintained in Section III.  All case file documents will be attached to the applicable ACTS electronic case file.  (T-1). 3.52.1.  AFCRPSG  attachment  9  shows  the  case  file  format  which  matches  the  ACTS Attachments tab. 3.52.2.  Paper copies of the investigative case file must be organized according to AFCRPSG attachment  9  using  the  tabs  applicable  in  each  situation.    Prepare  a  Table  of  Contents showing  the  contents  of  the  case  file.    Unused  tabs  should  be  documented  in  the  table  of contents  with  the  statement  ”This  tab  not  used.”    (T-3).    There  is  no  need  to  include  the unused tabs in the actual case file.  (T-3). 3.52.3.  As  a  minimum,  case  files  for  cases  resulting  in  investigation  must  contain  the following documentation (indexed and inserted in Sections I, II, and III at the prescribed tab): the  complaint;  tasking  memos  (if  any);  ROI;  legal  review;  the  testimony  (transcribed  or summarized, if taken); copy of response to complainant; copy of notification to the subject’s commander;  copy  of  commander’s  action  (if  applicable);  and  administrative  documents including memos, progress reports, and complaint acknowledgment or interim memos to the complainant.  (T-1).  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 81 3.52.4.  For cases requiring DoD approval, a paper case file is required.  Forward the entire paper  case  file  to  SAF/IGQ  after  appointing  authority  approval  via  the  appropriate MAJCOM,  NAF,  FOA,  and/or  DRU  as  AF/JAA  and  DoD  IG  require  SAF/IGQ  to  provide them  with  printed  reports,  properly  tabbed  and  formatted.    (T-1).    Because  ACTS  is  the System  of  Record  for  storing  IG  records,  IG  offices  should  not  maintain  paper  copies  of records. 3.53.  Report of Investigation (ROI) Format. 3.53.1.  The completed Report of Investigation is Section II of the case file.  Section III of the finalized  IG  case  file  contains  the  documents  supporting  the  results  of  the  investigation  in Section II.  AFCRPSG attachments 10 and 11 show the proper ROI format. 3.53.2.  For specific guidance on how to write an ROI, IOs must use this instruction and the SAF/IGQ IO Guide.  (T-1). 3.54.  Other Forms/Checklists. 3.54.1.  Reprisal  Investigation  Evaluation  Form.    Reprisal  cases  may  have  a  Reprisal Investigation Evaluation  Form completed when the case is finalized.  For specific guidance on how to complete this form, see AFCRPSG attachment 20. 3.55.  Reporting  Requirements    There  are  three  required  reports:  Periodic  Updates, Progress Reports, and Interim Responses 3.55.1.  Periodic Updates (PU).  Provide a PU to the complainant every 60 days after receipt of the complaint and every 60 days thereafter.  (T-1).  For ANG and Air Force Reserve IGs, provide  PUs  every  other  UTA.    If  there  is  an  investigation,  provide  PUs  to  the  subject  as well.  (T-1). 3.55.2.  Progress Reports (PR).  Provide a PR to the Appointing Authority and to higher-level IGs  when  a  case  has  not  been  finalized  by  the  suspense  date.    (T-1).    See  AFCRPSG attachment 12 for format.  The suspense date is defined by the Appointing Authority in the investigating officer appointment letter.  The first  PR is  due on or before the suspense date and on the first of every month thereafter until the investigation is completed.  Higher-level IGs may request additional PRs as necessary.  Document the status of the case, changes since the last PR and the estimated completion date in a case note in ACTS.  (T-1). 3.55.3.  Interim Response (IR).  Provide an IR to the complainant whenever a case transfers between agencies or levels of command.  (T-1).  Provide IRs to both complainant and subject during an investigation.  (T-1). 3.56.  180-Day Notification Letter.  Provide a letter to IG DoD and to the complainant notifying them if a reprisal or restriction complaint analysis or investigation is not  completed within 180 days from the time the complainant alleges reprisal.  (T-0).  The IG DoD notification is routed through the applicable MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU and SAF/IGQ.  The IG office to which the case is currently assigned is responsible for the 180-Day Notification letter.  See AFCRPSG attachment 35. Phase 3:  Quality Review Phase  82 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 Section 3H—Step 7: IG Quality Review (< 5 Days) 3.57.  Requirement  for  IG  Quality  Reviews.  All  investigations  will  receive  a  quality  review (QR)  by  the  IG  staff  to  ensure  completeness,  compliance  with  this  instruction  and  other appropriate directives, and objectivity.  (T-1). 3.57.1.  If  the  IG  QR  detects  deficiencies  with  the  investigation  or  report,  the  IG  should return the case to the IO to be reworked.  (T-1). 3.57.2.  If  a  case  needs  to  be  returned  to  the  IO  to  be  reworked  due  to  deficiencies,  the  IG must explain the specific problems and rationale to the IO.  (T-1). 3.57.3.  If an IG disagrees with the IOs findings and conclusions, document the disagreement and proceed with the next step in the Complaint Resolution Process.  (T-1). Section 3I—Step 8: Technical Review (< 5 Days) 3.58.  When is a Technical Review Necessary? 3.58.1.  Sometimes  an  IO  will  be  asked  to  evaluate  information  or  interpret  guidance  in  a technical field beyond his/her normal range of expertise.  When this happens, the Appointing Authority should ask for a technical (expert) review of the applicable evidence, findings, and conclusions before the report is sent for a legal sufficiency review. 3.58.1.1.  The  key  question  will  be  how  important  the  technical  information  is  to  the overall conclusions in the report. 3.58.1.2.  A  good faith effort will be made to  retain  complainant  confidentiality.  (T-1).  The  Technical  Advisor  should  only  review  the  portion  of  the  investigation  required  to provide  the  technical  assistance  and  should  be  advised  of  the  need  to  maintain confidentiality. 3.58.2.  A  technical  review  must  explain,  in  detail,  whether  the  report  is  technically sufficient.    (T-1).    If  the  report  is  found  to  be  technically  inaccurate  or  deficient,  it  will  be returned to the IO to be reworked.  (T-1).  In this case, the technical review must explain, in detail,  the  reasons  why  the  report  was  deficient  and  the  minimum  requirements  for sufficiency.  (T-1). Section 3J—Step 9: Legal Review (< 10 Days) 3.59.  Requirement for Legal Reviews. 3.59.1.  IGs  will  have  all  Reports  of  Investigations  reviewed  by  a  JA  for  legal  sufficiency.  (T-1).    The  JA  will  provide  written  reviews  before  the  Appointing  Authority  approves  the report and its findings.  (T-1).  IGs should ensure the local servicing SJA is familiar with the SAF/IGQ JAG Guide to IG Investigations. 3.59.2.  A different JA should perform the legal review other than the individual assigned to advise the IO. 3.59.3.  A  thorough  legal  review  is  critical  to  the  IG  investigative  process  and  IG-JA-CC relationships.   The written review must reflect  a thorough review of the  case, to  include an independent review of all testimony and evidence.  When conducting a legal  review of any  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 83 IG  investigation,  the  attorney  performing  the  legal  review  must  complete  the  Inspector General Investigations Legal Review Checklist, which is available on the HAF/JAA website under the Inspector General IGS/IGQ tab.  (T-1). 3.59.4.  Each  legal  review  must  examine  whether:    (1)  Each  allegation  has  been  addressed;  (2)  Allegations  allege  a  violation  of  law,  regulation,  procedure,  or  policy;    (3)  The  IO reasonably  applied  the  preponderance  of  the  evidence  standard  in  arriving  at  findings;  (4) Conclusions  are  supported  by,  and  consistent  with,  the  findings;    (5)  The  investigation complies  with  all  applicable  legal  and  administrative  requirements;    (6)  Any  errors  or irregularities  exist,  and  if  so,  their  legal  effects,  if  any.    (T-1).    Along  with  documenting conclusions concerning each of these matters, the legal review must contain as an attachment a completed Inspector General Investigations Legal Review Checklist.  (T-1). 3.59.4.1.  If  the  legal  review  states  the  case  is  not  legally  sufficient,  it  must  include  a detailed  explanation  of  what  the  report  is  missing  or  lacking  that  makes  it  legally insufficient.  (T-1).  The IG will return the case to the IO to be reworked IAW Section 3K.  (T-1).  The IO must make the report legally sufficient.  (T-1). 3.59.4.2.  In  cases  in  which  the  legal  review  simply  disagrees  with  the  IO’s  ultimate findings  and  conclusions, the rationale  for that  disagreement  will be provided to  the  IO for consideration.  (T-1).  If the IO, after considering the review, disagrees with the legal review, the IO will not be directed to change the disputed findings or conclusions.  (T-1).  Instead, the ROI and legal review will be provided to the Appointing Authority for a final determination.    (T-1).    In  situations  where  the  disputed  findings  pertain  to  an investigation  of  reprisal  or  restriction,  the  Appointing  Authority  will  provide  his determination but, IG DoD will be the final determination authority.  (T-1). 3.59.5.  If the Appointing Authority disagrees with the IO’s findings and/or conclusions, the Appointing Authority must issue alternative findings and conclusions and document them in an addendum.   (T-1).  In such case, the Appointing Authority’s determination must include the  rationale  for  his  or  her  decision.    (T-1).    Merely  deferring  to  or  referencing  the  legal review is insufficient.  Rather, the Appointing Authority’s determination must separately set out  the  basis  for  the  determination  through  an  analysis  and  issue  new  findings  and/or conclusions.  (T-1). 3.59.6.  MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and SAF/IGQ may adopt a lower-level legal review.  All investigations  require  a  minimum  of  one  legal  review.    (T-1).    Additional  reviews  are optional but required if higher level quality review indicates the need for an additional legal review or if an addendum is accomplished that alters the findings or significantly changes the analysis  in  the  ROI.    (T-1).    HHQ  IGs  may  consult  with  HHQ  JA  on  sufficiency  of  lower level legal review as part of their QR. Table 3.16.  Actions to Take Based on Legal Sufficiency Review. A If an investigation is found to be… B Then… Legally sufficient Appointing Authority approves and sends final response to complainant, unless higher-level QR and R U L E 1  84 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 2  Not legally sufficient 3  Administratively sufficient approval is required.  If the Appointing Authority disagrees with the IO, see paragraph 3.62.2 Report is returned to the IO to be reworked.  The IO must make the report legally sufficient. Appointing Authority approves and sends final response to complainant, unless higher-level QR and approval is required.  If the Appointing Authority disagrees with the IO, see paragraph 3.62.2 4  Not administratively sufficient  Report is returned to the IO to be reworked if required. Section 3K—Step 10: Reworking the Report (< 5 Days) 3.60.  When Reports are Returned for Rework.  If a report is found to be insufficient, then the report will be returned to the IO for rework.  (T-1). 3.60.1.  The reason for the rework and the dates must be logged into ACTS.  (T-1). 3.60.2.  IG quality reviews, technical reviews, and/or legal reviews must provide reasons why the report was not sufficient and detail the minimum requirements for sufficiency.  (T-1). Section 3L—Step 11: Closing the Case (< 5 Days) 3.61.  Key  Terms.  This  section  uses  the  following  key  terms:  appointing  authority,  case  file, closure,  colonel  (or  civil  servant  Grade  15),  completion,  follow-up,  lieutenant  colonel  (or below), report of investigation, reprisal, restriction, senior official, third-party complainant, and third- party complaint.  Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms. 3.62.  Appointing  Authority  Approval.  Approval  of  an  IG  investigation  rests  with  the Appointing Authority, except for investigations of reprisal or restriction. 3.62.1.  The Appointing Authority will sign and approve the Report of Investigation (ROI) in writing.  (T-1). 3.62.2.  In  cases  where  the  Appointing  Authority  disagrees  with  the  IO’s  findings  and conclusions,  the  Appointing  Authority  will  non-concur  with  the  ROI  in  writing  in  an addendum  to  the  ROI.    (T-1).    Merely  deferring  to  or  referencing  the  legal  review  (if applicable) or findings and conclusion is insufficient.  The Appointing Authority must clearly explain the reasons for the disagreement and the supporting rationale in the addendum.  (T-1).The  IO’s  findings,  legal  review,  and  the  Appointing  Authority’s  addendum  will  be retained  as  part  of  the  investigation  case  file  and  forwarded  to  the  next  higher-level  IG  for review via ACTS.  (T-1). 3.62.3.  Upon  Appointing  Authority  approval  of  the  ROI,  the  IG  will  place  the  case  in completed status in ACTS.  (T-1). 3.63.  Closure  Requirements.  Upon  the  Appointing  Authority’s  approval  of  an  investigation, all  notification  procedures  IAW  the  applicable  notification  matrix  must  be  completed,  unless otherwise directed by a higher-level IG.  Use Table 3.17 for investigations on lieutenant colonels (or below), Table 4.2 for senior officials, and Table 5.1 for colonels (or civil servant Grade 15). Refer  to  specific  chapters  for  additional  closure  requirements  on:  investigations  against  senior  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 85 officials or colonels (or civil servant Grade 15); investigations regarding allegations of reprisal or restriction; congressional taskings; MEO complaints; and DoD Hotline complaints. 3.63.1.  Mandatory actions required to close a case are: 3.63.1.1.  ROI approved by Appointing Authority.  (T-1). 3.63.1.2.  Subject’s commander notified of results.  (T-1). 3.63.1.3.  Complainant notified of results.  (T-1). 3.63.1.4.  Command action if appropriate.  (T-1). 3.63.2.  EXCEPTIONS: 3.63.2.1.  For closure requirements on reprisal cases, refer to paragraph 6.10. 3.63.2.2.  For closure requirements on restriction investigations, refer to paragraph 7.10. 3.63.2.3.  For additional closure requirements for investigations conducted as a result of a congressional complaint, refer to paragraph 9.6. 3.63.2.4.  For additional closure requirements for investigations conducted as a result of an MEO complaint, refer to paragraph 10.5. 3.63.2.5.  For additional closure requirements for investigations conducted as a result of a DoD Hotline complaint, refer to paragraph 12.6. 3.63.3.  IGs at every level are required to update all completed actions in ACTS (refer to the ACTS User’s Manual) and are required to maintain an electronic case file in ACTS until its final  disposition  date.    (T-1).    Leave  case  in  completed  status  in  ACTS  until  all  required quality,  legal,  and  higher-level  reviews  as  well  as  required  notifications  and  any  command actions are complete, at which time the case will be closed in ACTS.  (T-1). 3.63.4.  Cases  pending  command/corrective  action  will  be  placed  in  follow-up  on  the suspense tab in ACTS until a copy of the action taken is received.  (T-1). 3.63.5.  Investigations involving allegations of reprisal or restriction, or allegations against a colonel  (or  civil  servant  Grade  15),  must  be  forwarded  through  the  applicable  MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG to SAF/IGQ for quality review.  (T-1).  Transfer the case in ACTS to the next appropriate level for review.  (T-1). 3.64.  Notification Requirements for Case Closures. 3.64.1.  Table  3.17  describes  the  notification  requirements  upon  completion  of  IG investigations when the subject is a lieutenant colonel (or below). 3.64.2.  The Appointing Authority must notify the subject’s commander of the results of the investigation  in  writing.    (T-1).    The  commander  must,  in  turn,  notify  the  subject  of  the results  of  the  investigation  in  writing.    (T-1).    The  notification  letters  must  include  a description  of  the  specific  allegations  and  related  findings.    (T-1).    The  letters  must  not contain the names of the complainants, witnesses, or other subjects of the investigation.  (T-1).    Refer  to  AFCRPSG  attachment  13  for  a  sample  results  notification  to  the  subject’s commander with an endorsement for the commander’s notification to the subject. 3.64.3.  The  authority  responsible  for  making  release  determinations  will  automatically provide  the  subject’s  commander  with  a  copy  of  the  relevant  portions  of  an  approved  and  86 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 substantiated  report  of  investigation  (without  attachments)  for  determining  appropriate command  action.    (T-1).    Recipients  must  comply  with  all  applicable  guidance  in  Chapter 13.  For Senior Official cases, see 4.5.2.1. 3.64.3.1.  In  the  case  where  there  is  an  addendum  that  becomes  part  of  the  ROI,  the originating appointing authority of the addendum is the authority responsible for making release determinations. 3.65.  Responding  to  Complainants  after  Closing  an  Investigation.  Final  response  to  the complainant is generally the final step before case closure. 3.65.1.  Responses to complainants must be timely, and supported by the evidence.  (T-1). 3.65.2.  Responses  to  complainants  should  address  all  allegations  as  framed  during  the complaint  analysis.    The  response  does  not  necessarily  have  to  address  each  individual question or allegation originally made by the complainant. 3.65.3.  Complainants will receive a response from the level that conducted the investigation, unless otherwise directed by higher-level IG.  (T-1).  EXCEPTIONS: 3.65.3.1.  For  reprisal  or  restriction,  SAF/IGQ  will  provide  a  copy  of  IG  DoD  final approval of the investigation to the applicable MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU.  It is the responsibility of the MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU to provide the final response to the complainant.    (T-1).    See  paragraph  6.10.2  and    7.10.2,  respectively,  for  further information. 3.65.3.2.  MAJCOM,  JFHQ,  FOA,  or  DRU  will  provide  final  response  to  complainants for  investigations  conducted  as  a  result  of  congressional  complaints.    (T-0).    Refer  to Chapter 8. 3.65.4.  Complainants  will  receive  a  final  response,  in  a  publicly-releasable  format,  in writing,  with  the  findings  of  the  investigation.    (T-0).    When  responding  to  third-party complainants, refer to paragraph 3.65.7. 3.65.5.  Final  responses  to  complainants  must  inform  them  of  their  right  to  petition  the  Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) despite the findings in the case.  (T-1).    Final  responses  to  complainants  must  also  inform  them  of  their  rights  to  request review by the next level IG.  (T-1). 3.65.5.1.  Simply  disagreeing  with  the  findings  or  with  the  command  action  taken  in response  to  the  findings  is  not  sufficient  reason  to  justify  a  higher-level  review  or additional investigation. (T-1). 3.65.5.2.  It  is  the  complainant’s  responsibility  to  provide  new  and  compelling information that justifies a higher-level review on previously considered issues.  (T-1). 3.65.5.3.  It  is  the  complainant’s  responsibility  to  request  this  review  in  writing  to  the next  level  IG  within  90  days  of  receiving  the  response  and  to  provide  specific  reasons why they believe the original complaint resolution was not valid or adequate.  (T-1). 3.65.6.  Ensure  responses  to  complainants  are  consistent  with  FOIA  and  PA  release guidelines in Chapter 13.  (T-1).  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 87 3.65.7.  Third-party  complainants  are  only  entitled  to  an  acknowledgement  that  their complaint was received.   (T-3).  They will not  receive information  regarding  the resolution unless the affected party authorizes the release of information to that third-party via a Privacy Act release. Table 3.17.  Notification Matrix for Closure of IG Investigations on Lieutenant Colonels (or Below). R U L E A If an investigation is conducted and the allegations are… 1  Substantiated B Then… 1.  Appointing Authority notifies subject’s commander in writing (see paragraph 3.64.2). 2.  Commander notifies subject, in writing (see paragraph 3.64.2), and takes disciplinary/corrective action. 3.  Provide final response to complainant (see paragraph 3.65). 4.  Commander notifies Appointing Authority of command or corrective action. 5.  Provide SAF/IGQ with final command action. 2  Not Substantiated 1.  Appointing Authority notifies subject’s commander in writing (see paragraph 3.64.2). 2.  Commander notifies subject in writing (see paragraph 3.64.2). 3.  Provide final response to complainant (see paragraph 3.65). Section 3M—Step 12: Command Action 3.66.  Key  Terms.  This  section  uses  these  following  key  terms:    accountability,  command action, and corrective action.  Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms. 3.67.  Policy.  Command  action  is  the  responsibility  of  the  commander  who  is  responsible  for, and maintains accountability of, the process, operation, organization, or individual. 3.67.1.  Taking Command Action In Reprisal or Restriction Cases.  Commanders taking command  action  must  do  so  within  45  days  of  notification  of  IG  DoD’s  approval  of  the investigation’s finding.  (T-1). 3.67.2.  Notification of Command Action In Reprisal or Restriction Cases.  Commanders will  immediately  notify  their  IG,  in  writing,  of  command  action  taken  (or  provide  written documentation that no command action was taken).  (T-1).  The IG must enter the command action in ACTS and notify SAF/IGQ that the command action is available for forwarding to IG, DoD. (T-1). Section 3N—Step 13: Higher Headquarters Review (< 14 Days) 3.68.  Requirement for Higher Headquarters Quality Review (QR). 3.68.1.  The following cases will be sent to higher headquarters for QR:  (T-1).  88 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 3.68.1.1.  Allegations of reprisal or restriction.  (T-1). 3.68.1.2.  Cases involving subjects who are colonels (or civilian equivalents).  (T-1). 3.68.1.3.  Cases  where  the  Appointing  Authority  wrote  an  addendum  (see  paragraph 3.62.2).  (T-1). 3.68.2.  MAJCOMs,  JFHQs,  FOAs,  and  DRU  IGs  will  conduct  oversight  and  QRs  for investigations completed at a lower-level before being forwarded to SAF/IGQ for QR, (T-1) to ensure that: 3.68.2.1.  All valid allegations were addressed.  (T-1). 3.68.2.2.  The investigation was conducted with thoroughness, objectivity, and in a timely manner.  (T-1). 3.68.2.3.  The  findings  and  conclusions  are  supported  by  a  preponderance  of  the evidence.  (T-1). 3.68.2.4.  Legal reviews were conducted as required by this instruction.  (T-1). 3.68.2.5.  Command action (when required) is/was taken and is documented.  (T-1). 3.68.3.  When deficiencies are identified, reopen the investigation if necessary to correct any shortcomings.  Whenever possible, have the original IO complete the additional work needed and revise the report.  When circumstances warrant, the MAJCOM or JFHQ may complete the additional work needed, conduct an additional legal review, and revise the report with an addendum.    When  an  addendum  is  accomplished,  IGs  must  check  the  "Addendum Accomplished" checkbox in the ACTS case file main tab. 3.68.4.  MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, and DRU IGs will conduct a QR. All investigations require a minimum of one legal review.  Additional legal reviews are optional but required if higher level  quality  review  indicates  the  need  for  an  additional  legal  review  or  if  an  addendum  is accomplished that alters the findings or significantly changes the analysis in the ROI.  HHQ IGs may consult with HHQ JA on sufficiency of lower level legal review as part of their QR.  (T-1). 3.68.5.  MAJCOM,  JFHQ,  FOA,  and  DRU  IGs  will  conduct  a  QR  for  investigations conducted as a result of congressional complaints, unless otherwise directed by higher-level IG.  (T-1). 3.68.6.  MAJCOM,  JFHQ,  FOA,  and  DRU  IGs  will  provide  feedback  to  lower-level  IGs upon  completion  of  the  QR.    Refer  to  paragraph  3.69  if  disagreeing  with  lower-level findings. 3.69.  Disagreement  with  Findings.  In  cases  where  a  higher  headquarters  QR  disagrees  with the  findings,  conclusions,  or  determinations  made  at  the  level  immediately  below,  the  higher-level IG will reach a determination and document the findings in an addendum.  The higher-level IG will review the issues and consult a JA before forwarding the report to SAF/IGQ, if required. Under no circumstances will a MAJCOM IG forward a disputed case to SAF/IGQ for resolution.  The higher-level IG will: 3.69.1.  Obtain  an  additional  legal  review  for  legal  sufficiency  before  determining  the  final finding (substantiated or not substantiated) for each disputed allegation contained in the ROI.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 89 3.69.2.  Document any discrepancies/new findings in writing with an addendum to the ROI, fully  explaining  the  rationale  for  the  new  findings,  and  address  any  disagreements  between IOs, legal reviewers or other reviewers. 3.69.3.  Provide  a  new  response  to  complainant  when  the  findings  differ  from  previous conclusions or responses. 3.69.4.

This  section  uses  the  following  key  terms:  adverse  information,  misconduct, senior officer unfavorable information file (SOUIF), and senior official.  Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms. 4.2.  Requirements for Investigating Allegations Against Senior Officials. 4.2.1.  SAF/IGS  manages  the  Senior  Official  Complaints  Program.    Only  SAF/IGS  (unless otherwise  specified  by  SAF/IG)  will  conduct  investigations  into  non-criminal  allegations against senior officials. 4.2.1.1.  Complaints alleging violations of Military Equal Opportunity (MEO) policy by a senior official are handled by SAF/IGS. 4.2.1.2.  If an investigation that is  started on  an  O-6 subject  is  not  completed when that subject  is  selected  for  promotion  to  brigadier  general  (or  is  selected  for  a  Certificate  of Eligibility to O-7 in the case of ANG officers), it will be at the discretion of SAF/IGS to either assume responsibility for the investigation or allow the investigation to continue to completion.  For such cases that are completed below the SAF/IGS level, SAF/IGS will provide an oversight review of the case. 4.2.1.3.  SAF/IGS will generally comply with all policies and procedures outlined in this instruction,  consistent  with  SAF/IG  guidance,  current  management,  and  any  personnel policies  affecting  senior  officials.    IAW  AFI  36-2706,  SAF/IGS  does  not  investigate civilian EO/Sexual Harassment allegations against senior officials.  Those matters will be worked within the appropriate EO channels. 4.2.2.  Commanders and civilians leading an organization designated as a unit IAW AFI 38-101,  at  all  levels,  including  joint  commands,  will  immediately  notify  SAF/IGS  of  any allegations  or  potentially  adverse  information  involving  senior  officials  and  provide  an information  copy  to  the  servicing  installation  IG  office  who  provides  a  copy  to  their MAJCOM  IG.    (T-1).    IGs  will  notify  SAF/IGS  of  any  allegations  or  potentially  adverse information  using  the  procedures  in  Table  4.1.    (T-1).    Use  the  notification  letter  format described in AFCRPSG attachment 14. 4.2.2.1.  IGs who receive complaints against an Air Force senior official may only inform their  commanders  about  the  general  nature  of  the  issues  and  the  identity  of  the  subject.

SAF/IGS  will  conduct  a  complaint  analysis  on  all  complaints  involving  Air  Force senior officials.  The complaint analysis will be used to analyze the validity of the complaint and to recommend a course of action to SAF/IG.  92 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 4.2.4.1.  Due to the limited number of investigating officers, the unconstrained nature of complaints, and the complexities involved with conducting sensitive investigations across the entire Air Force, the CRP processing timelines in Table 3.1 may be extended. 4.2.5.  SAF/IGS will conduct a complaint analysis for complaints containing allegations with multiple subjects that include a senior official. 4.2.6.  SAF/IG will review and approve the complaint analysis. 4.2.7.  Throughout  the  complaint  process,  from  the  initial  receipt  of  the  complaint  to  the closing of the case, the appropriate notifications will be made as set forth in Table 4.2.

SAF/IGS  will provide the complete report within five (5) duty days after  the final  report is approved by SAF/IG. 4.5.5.  SAF/IGS  notifies  AF/DPS  and  SAF/GCA  on  all  matters  substantiated  against  AF civilian senior leaders and officials.  These offices are tasked with taking the matters to the Executive Resources Board (ERB) for action.  SAF/IGS will provide a copy of the final ROI to SAF/GCA and the exhibits thereto when requested. 4.6.  SOUIFs on Brigadier Generals. 4.6.1.  A  SOUIF  is  a  written  summary  of  adverse  information  about  an  officer, documentation of the command action, plus any comments from the subject officer regarding the  written  summary  and  documentation.    A  SOUIF  is  created  for  use  during  the  general officer promotion/federal recognition process and exists solely for that purpose. 4.6.1.1.  SOUIFs  on  brigadier  generals  are  based  on  adverse  information  not  previously considered by the Senate pursuant to the officer’s appointment to that grade. 4.6.2.  SAF/IGS acts as a central repository for all adverse information on senior officials and prepares  the  draft  adverse  information  summaries  (AIS)  and  documentation  of  command action for review by the SOUIF decision authority (SAF/GC). 4.6.3.  SAF/GC, acting for the SECAF, determines the content of the SOUIF and whether the SOUIF will be provided to a selection board. 4.6.3.1.  The subject officer will be given a copy of the draft AIS and documentation of the command action prepared for the selection board and will be afforded an opportunity to submit written comments to the selection board IAW 10 USC 615(a)(7)(A). 4.6.3.1.1.  Attachments  to  officer’s  comments  are  discouraged.    If  provided,  they must be limited to matters directly raised in the AIS and/or command action and not otherwise included in the Officer’s Selection Record (OSR).  96 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 4.6.3.2.  The  draft  AIS,  documentation  and  the  officer’s  comments  (if  any)  will  be reviewed  by  AF/JAA  and  SAF/GCM  before  being  forwarded  to  SAF/GC  for  final decision.  (The officer will be advised if a substantial change to the AIS is necessitated by the comments.) 4.6.3.3.  If SAF/GC determines the AIS and documentation will be provided to the board, the  subject  officer’s  comments  will  accompany  the  AIS  and  documentation  to  form  the approved SOUIF. 4.6.3.4.  AF/DPG provides a copy of the approved SOUIF to the subject’s senior rater on or before the Promotion Recommendation Form (PRF) accountability date if possible. 4.6.3.5.  If  an  eligible  officer  is  selected  for  promotion/federal  recognition,  the information  contained in  the SOUIF may also  be considered during the nomination and confirmation process. 4.6.3.6.  Information  provided  to  a  selection  board  may  not  be  provided  to  subsequent boards  unless  SAF/GC  has  made  a  new  determination  that  the  information  will  be forwarded  to  the  board,  and  the  individual  is  afforded  another  opportunity  to  comment.  A decision not to provide a SOUIF to a selection board does not preclude a decision to provide it to a subsequent board. 4.6.3.7.  The subject officer will be notified of SAF/GC’s final decision.  If the SOUIF is established,  the  officer  will  be  given  a  copy  of  the  SOUIF  provided  to  the  selection board. 4.6.4.  Adverse  information  documented  in  the  Officer’s  Selection  Record,  e.g.,  UCMJ action,  administrative  reprimand,  admonishment  or  counseling,  will  not  be  included  in  a SOUIF. 4.6.5.  Adverse  information  not  considered  by  a  selection  board  will  be  presented  to  a promotion  review  board  (PRB)  before  SECAF  decides  whether  to  support  the  officer  for appointment  to  the  next  higher  grade.    (All  SOUIF  policies  noted  above  apply  to  PRB SOUIFs.)  A PRB SOUIF may also include a copy of the report of investigation.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 97 Chapter 5 COMPLAINTS AGAINST COLONELS (AND CIVIL SERVANTS GRADE 15) AND ADVERSE INFORMATION REPORTING 5.1.

Commander-Directed Investigations (CDI) on Colonels (or civil servant Grade 15) and on other field grade officers (majors and lieutenant colonels) 5.9.1.  Commanders  will  notify  SAF/IGQ  through  their  MAJCOM,  NAF,  JFHQ,  FOA,  or DRU IG when beginning a CDI into complaints against a colonel (or civil servant Grade 15).  (T-1). 5.9.1.1.  Commanders  should  use  the  notification  letter  described  in  AFCRPSG attachment  15  and  forward  the  notification  through  their  local  IG  office  to  SAF/IGQ through their MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG. 5.9.1.2.  Commanders will, upon completion of a CDI, provide SAF/IGQ (through their local  IG)  with  a  copy  of  the  required  documents  as  listed  in  Table  5.3  rules  1  or  2  (as applicable).  (T-1). 5.9.2.  The  commander,  not  the  IG,  is  the  authority  responsible  for  making  release determinations for CDI reports.  IG offices will not be the repository for original CDI reports. Commanders or their designated representatives maintain original CDI reports/records. 5.10.  SOUIFs on Colonels. 5.10.1.  The Air Force General Counsel (SAF/GC) determines if a SOUIF is created. 5.10.1.1.  SAF/IGQ  prepares  adverse  information  summaries  (AIS)  from  investigative and other files, or from disciplinary or administrative command actions. 5.10.1.2.  SOUIFs  on  colonels  are  based  on  adverse  information  which  includes  any substantiated adverse findings or conclusions from an officially documented investigation or inquiry, or other official records or reports, arising generally within the ten-year period preceding  the  convening  date  of  the  selection  board  that  will  consider  the  officer  for promotion to general officer grade. 5.10.1.3.  SOUIFs  are  created  for  use  during  the  general  officer  promotion  process  selective early retirement boards and exist solely for those purposes. 5.10.2.  The  Air  Force  General  Counsel  (SAF/GC),  acting  for  the  SECAF,  determines whether the SOUIF will be provided to a selection board. 5.10.2.1.  Officers  will  be  provided  a  copy  of  the  draft  AIS  being  considered  for submission to the promotion board and will be afforded an opportunity to submit written comments  on  that  information  to  SAF/GC  IAW  10  USC  615  (a)(7)(A)(i)  and  (ii),  and before SAF/GC makes a final determination. 5.10.2.2.  The draft AIS and the officer’s comments (if any) will be reviewed by AF/JAA and SAF/GCI before being forwarded to SAF/GC for final decision. 5.10.2.3.  If SAF/GC approves the SOUIF, the SOUIF is then provided to AF/DPO. 5.10.2.4.  AF/DPO provides a  copy of the  approved SOUIF to  the subject’s senior  rater and  management  level  on  or  before  the  Promotion  Recommendation  Form  (PRF) accountability date if possible.   NOTE:   If an  eligible officer is  selected for promotion, the  information  contained  in  the  SOUIF  may  also  be  considered  during  the  nomination and confirmation process.  106 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 5.10.2.5.  Information  provided  to  a  selection  board  may  not  be  provided  to  subsequent boards  unless  SAF/GC  has  made  a  new  determination  that  the  information  will  be forwarded  to  the  board,  and  the  individual  has  again  been  afforded  an  opportunity  to comment.    Further,  a  decision  not  to  provide  a  SOUIF  to  a  promotion  board  does  not preclude a decision to provide it to a subsequent board. 5.10.3.  A  commander’s  decision  regarding  information  in  an  Unfavorable  Information  File (UIF) or Officer’s Selection Record (OSR) maintained by the Air Force Personnel System is unrelated to SAF/GC’s decision to place this information in a SOUIF. 5.10.3.1.  SAF/GC  will  not  usually  create  a  SOUIF  if  an  official  record  of  nonjudicial punishment  or  other  adverse  information  is  maintained  in  an  officer's  selection  record (OSR), as required by AFI 36-2608. 5.10.4.  Adverse  information  not  substantiated  in  time  for  review  by  a  general  officer selection or federal recognition board will be presented to a promotion review board before SECAF decides whether to support the officer for appointment to the next higher grade.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 107 Chapter 6 REPRISAL COMPLAINTS   Directives.  10  USC  1034,  Protected  communications;  prohibition  of 6.1.  Governing retaliatory  personnel  actions  and  DoDD  7050.06,  Military  Whistleblower  Protection,  provide guidance on whistleblower rights and responsibilities. 6.2.  Key  Terms.  This section uses the following key terms: abuse of authority, acid test, case file,  chain  of  command,  gross  mismanagement,  gross  waste  of  funds,  Headquarters  US  Air Force, fund instrumentality,  personnel  action,  protected  communication,  report  of  investigation,  reprisal, responsible  management  official,  restriction,  and  unlawful  communication. to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms. lawful  communication,  nonappropriated fund  employee,  nonappropriated   Refer 6.3.  Whistleblower  Protection  Against  Reprisal  Under  Title  10,  United  States  Code, Section 1034 (10 USC 1034). 6.3.1.  Members  of  the  armed  forces  shall  be  free  from  reprisal  for  making  or  preparing  to make a protected communication (PC). 6.3.1.1.  No  person  may  take  (or  threaten  to  take)  an  unfavorable  personnel  action;  or withhold  (or  threaten  to  withhold)  a  favorable  personnel  action  as  reprisal  against  a member  of  the  armed  forces  for  making  or  preparing,  or  being  perceived  as  making  or preparing, to make a protected communication. 6.3.1.2.  Military members who violate this prohibition are subject to prosecution and/or disciplinary and administrative action under Article 92 of the UCMJ. 6.3.1.3.  Civilian employees who violate this prohibition are subject to administrative or disciplinary  action  under  applicable  directives  or  implementing  instructions  governing civilian disciplinary or administrative action. 6.3.1.4.  No  commander  or  supervisor  may  refer  a  Service  member  for  an  MHE  as  a reprisal for making or preparing to make a protected communication. 6.3.2.  The  following  may  receive  protected  communications  (NOTE:  this  list  is  not  all inclusive and the circumstances of each case will determine if there is a PC; see the definition of protected communication in  Attachment 1 for  more  guidance on when  a communication made to any of the following is a protected communication): 6.3.2.1.  Member of Congress or a member of their staff. 6.3.2.2.  An inspector general or a member of the inspector general’s investigative staff. 6.3.2.3.

Any person in the member’s chain of command. 6.3.2.5.  The Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Command Chiefs, Group/Squadron Superintendents, and First Sergeants. 6.3.2.6.  A court-martial proceeding.  108 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 6.3.3.  Nothing  in  this  instruction  will  dissuade  commanders  from  taking  timely  and appropriate  corrective  actions  for  legitimate  reasons,  including  violations  of  the  UCMJ, violations  of  other  criminal  statutes,  or  other  misconduct,  whether  or  not  information regarding  the  misconduct  came  through  a  protected  communication.    Commanders  should understand  the  prohibitions  on  reprisal  and  restriction  and  should  coordinate  with  the servicing SJA office for effective legal guidance on these issues. 6.3.4.  Air Force members may file complaints of reprisal with  IGs at any level and receive the protections of 10 USC 1034. 6.3.5.  To gain statutory protection of the law, the Air Force member must file the complaint with any IG within one year of becoming aware of the unfavorable personnel action that is the subject of the allegation.  The IG may waive this time requirement if they determine there are extenuating circumstances justifying the delay in filing the complaint or there is special Air Force interest in the matter.  Refer to Table 3.12, rule 3 for additional information. 6.4.  Policy  for  Receipt  of  Reprisal  Complaints.  The following outlines Air Force policy for receiving  reprisal  complaints.   All  IGs  during  the  complaint  analysis  process  will  consider  the UPAs and PCs presented by the complainant in the complaint regardless of whether reprisal or restriction is raised. 6.4.1.  Military Members.  Air Force IGs must advise military members alleging reprisal of the  provisions  of  10  USC  1034  and  DoDD  7050.06,  and  of  the  rights  afforded  to complainants under the Whistleblower Protection Statute.  (T-0).  IGs should use AFCRPSG attachment 16, Whistleblower Rights under 10 USC 1034, to assist them. 6.4.1.1.  The IG must comply with the notification requirements described in paragraph 6.5, and depending on the subject’s grade, paragraph 3.32,  4.3, or  5.6 as appropriate.  (T-1). 6.4.1.2.  IGs  should  ask  complainants  whether  they  have  also  filed  their  complaint  with IG DoD.  If the complainant has, then IGs should include this in the notification letter to IG DoD (refer to paragraph 6.5).  No complaint analysis at their level is required unless otherwise directed by a higher-level IG (refer to paragraph 6.6.3). 6.4.1.3.  IGs  must  ask  the  complainant  whether  the  allegations  that  constituted  the member’s  protected  communication  were  previously  addressed.    (T-1).    For  additional information, refer to paragraph 6.6.2. 6.4.2.  If an IG receives a complaint from a civilian employee in which they allege reprisal, follow the guidance in Table 6.1.  (T-1). Table 6.1.  Reprisal Referral for Civilian Employees. A If the aggrieved party is a… R U L E 1  Department of the Air Force civil service employee  B Then… Direct the complainant to IG DoD Hotline (http://www.dodig.mil/hotline//fwacompl.htm ) or local EO office for reprisal allegations relating to an EEO complaint AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 109 2  Department of the Air Force nonappropriated fund employee 3  Defense contractors Direct the complainant to IG DoD Hotline (http://www.dodig.mil/hotline//fwacompl.htm ) or local EO office for reprisal allegations relating to an EEO complaint Direct the complainant to IG DoD Hotline (http://www.dodig.mil/hotline//fwacompl.htm) 6.4.3.  Air  Force  IGs  will  not  conduct  investigations  into  complaints  of  reprisal  actions alleging  Air  Force  civil  service  employees,  nonappropriated  fund  employees,  or  defense contractor employees are the victims of reprisal.  (T-1).  These employees receive protection from statutes other than 10 USC 1034. 6.4.4.  29 Code of Federal  Regulations  Part 1614 requires reprisal  allegations in  connection with an EEO complaint be processed through the EEO procedures.  (T-1). 6.5.  Notification Requirements for Reprisal Complaints.  IAW DoDD 7050.06, IG DoD must be  notified  (through  SAF/IGQ)  within  10  duty  days  from  the  date  an  IG  receives  a  complaint containing allegations of reprisal.  To meet IG DoD’s 10-day notification requirement, IGs at all levels  will  notify  SAF/IGQ  through  their  MAJCOM,  NAF,  JFHQ,  FOA,  or  DRU  IG  within  7 duty days using the letter format in AFCRPSG attachment 17.  (T-0).  Attach the letter in ACTS and send the notification in ACTS to the next higher-level IG. 6.5.1.  Before  sending  the  notification,  the  IG  will  determine  if  the  complaint  needs  to  be transferred to another IG.  (T-1).  If so, notification requirements belong to the receiving IG. Reference Tables 3.7 and  3.8. 6.5.2.  Prior  to  sending  the  notification,  if  the  IG  determines  that  answers  to  questions  one and  two  of  the  acid  test  (AFCRPSG  attachment  18)   are  not  both  yes,  or,  that  while  the answers  to  questions  one  and  two  are  "Yes,"  the  reason  for  the  personnel  action  is  not reprisal (i.e., the action was taken for a valid reason), the required notification can include a recommendation to dismiss the issue. (T-1). 6.5.2.1.  A  recommendation  to  dismiss  the  allegation  must  include  the  rationale  for  the selected resolution strategy and supporting documentation.  (T-1). 6.5.3.  Upload a copy of the written complaint, or a detailed narrative of the allegations, with the notification letter in ACTS and notify SAF/IGQ.  (T-1). 6.5.4.  IGs  receiving  allegations  not  within  the  purview  of  the  Air  Force  will  transfer  the complaint to SAF/IGQ through their MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG.  SAF/IGQ will transfer the complaint to the appropriate agency.  (T-1). 6.6.  Conducting a Reprisal Complaint Analysis (RCA).  The IG receiving the complaint must expeditiously  conduct  a  reprisal  complaint  analysis  to  determine  whether  an  investigation  is warranted.  (T-1).  Within  29 days after receipt  of the complaint, the  IG must notify SAF/IGQ (through  their  MAJCOM,  NAF,  JFHQ,  FOA,  or  DRU  IG)  of  the  results  of  the  complaint analysis.  (T-1).  Reserve and Guard IGs must complete the complaint analysis by the end of the next  Unit  Training  Assembly  after  receiving  the  complaint.    Follow  the  format  shown  in AFCRPSG attachment 1 when completing a complaint analysis into allegations of reprisal. 6.6.1.  Before  conducting  an  RCA,  the  IG  must  find  out  if  the  issues  that  constituted  the protected communication were previously addressed.  (T-1).  110 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 6.6.1.1.  If  the  issues  were  previously  addressed,  IGs  should  obtain  a  copy  of  the applicable documents from the appropriate agency. 6.6.1.2.  If  the  issues  were  not  previously  addressed,  the  IG  will  conduct  a  complaint analysis on them to determine the appropriate avenue for resolution.  (T-1). 6.6.2.  A  reprisal  complaint  analysis  will  be  conducted  following  the  procedures  in  Section 3C  and  this  paragraph.    (T-1).    Document  the  reprisal  complaint  analysis  following  the format in AFCRPSG attachment 1.  The IG may consult with the servicing SJA office prior to formalizing the complaint analysis. 6.6.2.1.  IGs should refer to the Acid Test for Reprisal (AFCRPSG Attachment 18) as a guide  to  address  the  reprisal  allegations.    The  reprisal  complaint  analysis  will  be completed  within  29  days  of  receipt  by  the  office  conducting  the  RCA.    (T-1).    When documenting an RCA, the IG will answer the first three questions of the Acid Test.  (T-1).    If  the  answers  to  the  first  three  acid  test  questions  are  "Yes,"  the  IG  will complete/conclude  the  reprisal  complaint  analysis  with  a  recommendation  to  the Appointing Authority to investigate unless a decision to dismiss can be logically derived primarily  from  documentary  evidence  and  minimal  clarification  interviews.   If insufficient  documentary  evidence  exists  to  recommend  dismissal,  investigation  is required.  (T-1).  During an RCA, answering question 4 of the Acid Test is not required, unless  the  answer  to  the  first  three  questions  is  “yes”  and  the  IG  is  recommending dismissal. 6.6.2.2.  If  an  investigation  is  warranted,  notify  SAF/IGQ  through  the    appropriate MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU via ACTS.  (T-1). 6.6.2.3.  If  a  reprisal  complaint  analysis  determines  a  reprisal  investigation  is  not warranted,  the  IG  conducting  the  complaint  analysis  must  forward  a  paper  copy  of  the analysis  including  a  copy  of  all  supporting  documents,  to  SAF/IGQ  through  their MAJCOM,  NAF,  JFHQ,  FOA,  or  DRU  IG  office.    (T-1).    IGs  must  put  the  case  in completed  status  in  ACTS  and  transfer  the  case  to  SAF/IGQ  through  their  MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG office.  (T-1). 6.6.2.3.1.  SAF/IGQ will provide an interim response to complainants informing them the complaint analysis was forwarded to IG DoD for final determination.  (T-1).  IGs will not advise the complainant of the recommendation that was sent to IG DoD.  (T-1). 6.6.2.3.2.  SAF/IGQ will forward the complaint analysis to IG DoD for approval. 6.6.2.3.3.  If  IG  DoD  agrees  with  the  Air  Force’s  determination,  they  will  notify SAF/IGQ  who will in  turn notify the MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU  IG.  It  is  the responsibility  of  the  MAJCOM  (SAF/IGQ  for  ANG  cases),  FOA,  or  DRU  IG  to notify  the  complainant  there  is  insufficient  evidence  to  conduct  a  reprisal investigation  under  10  USC  1034.    (T-0).    Upon  case  closure,  the  MAJCOM  IGQs will notify (via ACTS) the IG that conducted the complaint analysis. 6.6.2.3.4.  If  IG  DoD  disagrees  with  the  Air  Force’s  determination,  they  may  retain the  complaint  for  investigation  or  direct  the  Air  Force  to  conduct  an  investigation.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 111 SAF/IGQ will normally delegate the investigation down to the lowest-level IG office through the MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG. 6.6.2.4.  If the complaint analysis determines the allegation does not meet the definition of reprisal under 10 USC 1034, analyze the allegation as potential abuse of authority and document the analysis in the CA.  (T-1).  Use AFCRPSG attachment 19 for the acid test for abuse of authority in your analysis. 6.6.3.  If the complainant files concurrent complaints with an Air Force IG and IG DoD, the IG  DoD  will  conduct  the  complaint  clarification.    IG  DoD  may  direct  the  Air  Force  to conduct an investigation. 6.6.4.  To  the  maximum  extent  possible  the  complaint  analysis  should  focus  on  the  "Who, What,  When,  Where  and  How"  facts  of  possible  violations  of  standards  to  include  reprisal and restriction.  If after collecting these facts, the IG is unable to make a determination as to whether  prima  facie  evidence  exists  of  possible  wrong  doing  without  interviewing  the subject(s), then the IG will recommend to the Appointing Authority that an investigation be conducted.  (T-1).  IGs will not interview subjects during complaint analysis without written approval  from  the  Appointing  Authority.    (T-1).    IGs  serving  as  IOs  under  blanket appointment  letters  are  still  required  to  complete  a  documented  complaint  analysis recommending  investigation  for  appointing  authority  approval  before  conducting  subject interviews unless given specific written authorization to do so in a particular case.  (T-1). 6.7.  Investigating Reprisal Complaints.  Conduct reprisal investigations IAW DoDD 7050.06 and this instruction. 6.7.1.  The IG conducting the reprisal investigations will be either: 6.7.1.1.  Outside  the  immediate  chain  of  command  of  both  the  member  submitting  the allegation and the individual or individuals alleged to have reprised, or:  (T-0). 6.7.1.2.  At least one organization higher in the chain of command than the organization of the member submitting the allegation and the individual or individuals alleged to have reprised.  (T-0). 6.7.1.3.  If  IG  DoD  receives  a  reprisal  complaint  directly  from  a  complainant,  IG  DoD will  conduct  the  reprisal  complaint  analysis.    If  IG  DoD  elects  to  have  the  Air  Force conduct the investigation, they will forward the analysis and a tasking letter to SAF/IGQ.  SAF/IGQ will forward the package to the MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG for proper handling of the complaint. 6.7.2.  IAW  DoDD  7050.06,  MAJCOM,  JFHQ,  FOA,  and  DRU  IGs  must  provide  an  180 Day  Notification  Letter  to  IG  DoD  (through  SAF/IGQ)  and  to  the  complainant  if  the investigation  is  not  completed  within  180  days  after  receipt  of  the  allegations.    (T-0).    The letters  must  include  the  reasons  for  the  delay  and  an  estimated  time  of  completion  for  the investigation.    IGs  must  also  comply  with  Air  Force  requirements  for  PUs  PRs  and  IRs  as specified in paragraphs 3.55 of this instruction.  (T-1).  Use the sample format in AFCRPSG attachment 12 for PRs. 6.7.3.  If  the  investigation  determines  the  allegation  does  not  meet  the  definition  of  reprisal under 10 USC 1034, analyze the allegation as potential abuse of authority and document the  112 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 analysis  in  the  ROI.    (T-1).    Use  AFCRPSG  attachment  19  for  the  acid  test  for  abuse  of authority in your analysis. 6.7.4.  The  final  Report  of  Investigation  (ROI)  must  identify  all  protected  communications, all  personnel  actions  alleged  to  be  acts  of  reprisal  taken  after  the  protected  communication was  made,  and  all  RMOs.    (T-1).    If  an  RMO  identified  in  the  complaint  analysis  is  not  a subject of the investigation, fully explain the rationale in the ROI.  (T-1). 6.7.5.  The final ROI must contain a thorough Acid Test for Reprisal with all four questions answered for each allegation of reprisal.    (T-1).   Refer to  AFCRPSG attachment 18 for the format to conduct an acid test. 6.7.6.  The  final  case  file  must  contain  a  chronology  of  events  beginning  with  the complainant’s  initial  protected  communication  plus  any  subsequent  PCs  and  list  all unfavorable  personnel  actions  taken  against  the  military  member  after  the  initial  protected communication.  (T-1). 6.7.7.  In  a  case  with  substantiated  findings  of  reprisal,  the  final  case  file  must  contain recommendations for an appropriate remedy for the whistleblower.  (T-1). 6.7.8.  When  a  complainant  alleges  a  combination  of  reprisal,  and/or  restriction  within  the same  complaint,  IGs  must  ensure  all  applicable  reporting  requirements  for  reprisal  or restriction, are completed IAW Chapters 6 or  7.  (T-1). 6.7.9.  All reprisal investigations require a minimum of one legal review.  (T-1).  Additional legal reviews are optional but required if higher level quality review indicates the need for an additional  legal  review  or  if  an  addendum  is  accomplished  that  alters  the  findings  or significantly changes the analysis in the ROI. 6.8.  Reprisal  Investigation  Evaluation  Form  and  SAF/IGQ  Case  Oversight  Checklist.  To ensure a thorough investigation has been completed, it is recommended a Reprisal Investigation Evaluation  Form  (AFCRPSG  attachment  20)  be  completed  for  reprisal  investigations.  AFCRPSG  attachment  20  includes  both  a  Reprisal  Investigation  Evaluation  Form  and  the SAF/IGQ  Case  Oversight  Checklist  as  tools  for  the  IO  and  IG  to  use  to  aid  in  determining whether a Report of Investigation adequately addresses the allegations. 6.9.  Reviewing  and  Approving  Reprisal  Investigations.  IG  DoD  must  approve  all  military reprisal investigations regardless of the level where the investigation was conducted.  IGs must mail  the  entire  case  file  (see  AFCRPSG  attachment  9)  to  SAF/IGQ  through  their  MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG and transfer the case in ACTS.  (T-1). 6.9.1.  Appointing  authorities  may  notify  the  subject’s  commander  of  the  investigation findings  when  they  approve  the  case,  but  must  inform  the  commander  the  final  findings could  change  because  final  approval  and  review  rests  with  IG  DoD  (DoDD  7050.06, paragraph 6.1.5).  Commanders should wait until after  IG DoD has approved the Report of Investigation  to  take  command  action  unless  the  action  taken  is  based  on  other  issues discovered during the investigation that do not include reprisal or restriction. 6.9.2.  SAF/IG will provide an IR to complainants informing them the investigation has been completed and forwarded to  IG DoD for final  approval.   Do not  inform the complainant of the unapproved investigation findings (i.e., substantiated or not substantiated).  (T-1).  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 113 6.9.3.  Before forwarding the case file to SAF/IGQ, MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA and DRU IGs will conduct a quality review (QR).  (T-1). 6.9.4.  SAF/IGQ will conduct a QR, IAW paragraph 3.71, prior to forwarding the case to IG DoD. 6.9.5.  Follow the procedures specified in Section 3N and/or  3O of this instruction if, during higher-level  QR,  deficiencies  are  identified  or  the  reviewing  official  disagrees  with  the findings. 6.10.  Final  Approval  and  Notification  Requirements.  IG  DoD  will  notify  SAF/IGQ  upon approval of the investigation’s findings. 6.10.1.  SAF/IGQ  will  provide  a  copy  of  IG  DoD’s  final  approval  to  the  applicable MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG.  (T-1). 6.10.2.  The  MAJCOM  (SAF/IGQ  for  ANG),  FOA,  or  DRU  IG  will  provide  the  final response  to  the  complainant  within  30  days  after  IG  DoD’s  approval  of  the  findings  as mandated by 10 USC 1034.  (T-0).  Upon case closure, the MAJCOM IGQs will notify the installation IG via ACTS, when applicable.  (T-0). 6.10.2.1.  Final responses to complainants must advise them of their right to petition the AFBCMR  for  correction  of  adverse  personnel  actions  (regardless  of  the  findings  in  the case), and their right to later appeal the AFBCMR findings to the Secretary of Defense.  (T-0).  Complainants should be referred to the virtual Military Personnel Flight (vMPF) (http://ask.afpc.randolph.af.mil/) for assistance. 6.10.2.1.1.  Complainants who petition the AFBCMR should inform the AFBCMR if IG records exist pertaining to the pending request. 6.10.2.1.2.  SAF/IGQ  will  provide  supporting  documentation  directly the AFBCMR (or applicable SAF/MRB agency) upon receipt of an Official Use Request from the board for IG records. to 6.10.2.2.  If  applicable,  complainants  should  also  be  advised  of  proper  procedures  for OPR/EPR/PRF  appeal  to  the  Evaluation  Reports  Appeal  Board  (ERAB).    (T-0).  Complainants should be referred to the vMPF for assistance. 6.10.2.3.  MAJCOM,  FOA,  or  DRU  IGs  will  provide  a  redacted  copy  of  the  ROI  (and addendum if any) with the final response to the complainant.  (T-0).  The ROI should be redacted using exceptions allowed by the FOIA, however, no coordination with the FOIA office is required.  (T-1).  Additionally, IGs have the authority (under 10 USC 1034) to act  on  complainant  requests  for  additional  documentation  from  reprisal  investigations without going through the FOIA office. 6.10.2.4.  MAJCOM,  FOA,  or  DRU  IGs  will  attach  a  copy  of  the  final  response  to  the complainant in ACTS.  (T-1). 6.10.2.5.  SAF/IGQ  will  provide  the  final  response  to  complainants  for  ANG  reprisal investigations.    (T-0).    SAF/IGQ  is  responsible  for  redacting  the  ROI  and  providing  a copy to the complainant. 6.10.3.  MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU IGs will forward a copy of IG DoD’s final approval of the investigation to the applicable appointing authority.  (T-1).  The Appointing Authority must  114 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 notify the subject’s commander of the final investigation findings but will not provide a copy of IG DoD’s letter to the commander.  (T-1).  The commander will notify the subject.  (T-1). 6.10.4.  IAW DoDD 7050.06, paragraph 6.3.8, a copy of command/corrective action must be provided to IG DoD.  When command/corrective action is finalized, IGs will obtain a copy to include any rebuttal statements.  (T-1).  However, if action is verbal or no action is taken, IGs will obtain a written description of the action from the commander.  (T-1).  IGs will forward these  documents  to  SAF/IGQ  through  their  MAJCOM,  NAF,  JFHQ,  FOA,  or  DRU  IG, within 7 duty days of becoming aware of such action being completed.  (T-1).  SAF/IGQ will forward the information to IG DoD. 6.10.5.  IGs  will  close  reprisal  complaints  IAW  established  procedures  as  described  in Chapter 3 of this instruction.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 115 Chapter 7 RESTRICTION COMPLAINTS   Directives.  10  USC  1034,  Protected  communications;  prohibition  of 7.1.  Governing retaliatory  personnel  actions  and  DoDD  7050.06,  Military  Whistleblower  Protection,  provide guidance on whistleblower rights and responsibilities. 7.2.  Key Terms.  This chapter uses the following key terms: access, chain of command, chilling effect,  lawful  communication,  prohibit,  protected  communication,  responsible  management official, and restriction.  Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms. 7.3.  Right of Access Protection Under Title 10, United States Code, Section 1034 (10 USC 1034). 7.3.1.  Pursuant  to  10 USC 1034, DoDD 7050.06, and as further defined in  this instruction, no person may restrict a member of the armed forces from: making or preparing to make a lawful communication to any of the following: 7.3.1.1.  A Member of Congress or a member of their staff. 7.3.1.2.  An Inspector General or a member of an Inspector General’s staff. 7.3.2.  Military  members  who  violate  this  prohibition  are  subject  to  prosecution  and/or disciplinary and administrative action under Article 92 of the UCMJ. 7.3.3.  Civilian  employees  who  violate  this  prohibition  are  subject  to  administrative  or disciplinary action. 7.3.4.  Air Force members may file complaints of restriction with IGs at any level. 7.3.5.  Air  Force  members  must  file  a  complaint  with  any  IG  within  one  year  of  becoming aware  of  restriction.    The  IG  may  waive  this  time  requirement  if  they  determine  there  are extenuating circumstances justifying the delay in filing the complaint or there is special Air Force interest in the matter. 7.4.  Policy for Receipt of Restriction Complaints.  The following outlines Air Force policy for receiving restriction complaints. 7.4.1.  Military Members.  Air Force IGs must advise military members alleging restriction of  the  provisions  of  10  USC  1034  and  DoDD  7050.06,  and  of  the  rights  afforded  to complainants under the Whistleblower Protection Statute.  (T-0).  IGs should use AFCRPSG attachment 16, Whistleblower Rights Under 10 USC 1034 to assist them. 7.4.1.1.  The IG must comply with the notification requirements described in paragraph 7.5, and depending upon the subject’s  grade, follow the procedures in  paragraph  3.32,  4.3, or  5.6 as appropriate.  (T-1). 7.4.1.2.  IGs  should  ask  complainants  whether  they  have  also  filed  their  complaint  with IG DoD.  If the complainant has, then IGs should include this in the notification letter to IG DoD (refer to paragraph 7.8).  Close the case with no further action unless otherwise directed by a higher-level IG.  116 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 7.4.2.  If  an  IG  receives  a  complaint  from  a  civilian  employee  in  which  they  allege restriction, follow the guidance in Table 7.1. Table 7.1.  Restriction Referral for Civilian Employees (T-1). A If the aggrieved party is a… B Then… R U L E 1  Department of the Air Force civil service employee 2  Department of the Air Force nonappropriated fund employee 3  Defense contractors Direct the complainant to DoD Hotline (www.dodig.mil/hotline/fwacompl.htm). Direct the complainant to DoD Hotline (www.dodig.mil/hotline/fwacompl.htm). Direct the complainant to DoD Hotline (www.dodig.mil/hotline/fwacompl.htm). 7.4.3.  IGs  will  not  conduct  investigations  into  complaints  of  restriction  when  the complainant  is  an  Air  Force  civil  service  employee,  nonappropriated  fund  employee,  or defense contractor employee.  (T-1).  These employees receive protection from statutes other than 10 USC 1034. 7.5.  Notification  Requirements  for  Restriction  Complaints.  IAW  DoDD  7050.06,  IG  DoD must  be  notified  (through  SAF/IGQ)  within  10  duty  days  from  the  date  an  IG  receives  a complaint  containing  allegations  of  restriction.    To  meet  IG  DoD’s  10-day  notification requirement, IGs at all levels will notify SAF/IGQ through their MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG within 7 duty days using the letter format in AFCRPSG attachment 17.  (T-0).  Once notification has been accomplished, attach the letter in ACTS and send the notification in ACTS to the next higher-level IG.  (T-1). 7.5.1.  Before  sending  the  notification,  the  IG  will  determine  if  the  complaint  needs  to  be transferred to another IG.  (T-1).  If so, notification requirements belong to the receiving IG. Reference Table 3.7 and  3.8. 7.5.2.  Upload a copy of the written complaint, or a detailed narrative of the allegations, with the notification letter in ACTS and notify SAF/IGQ.  (T-1). 7.5.3.  IGs  receiving  allegations  not  within  the  purview  of  the  Air  Force  will  transfer  the complaint to SAF/IGQ through their MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG.  SAF/IGQ will transfer the complaint to IG DoD.  (T-1). 7.6.  Conducting  a  Restriction  Complaint  Analysis.  The  IG  receiving  the  complaint  must conduct a complaint analysis to determine whether an investigation is warranted.  (T-1).  Within 29  days  after  receipt  of  the  complaint,  the  IG  must  notify  SAF/IGQ  (through  their  MAJCOM, NAF,  JFHQ,  FOA,  or  DRU  IG)  of  the  results  of  the  complaint  analysis.    (T-1).    Reserve  and Guard IGs must complete the complaint analysis by the end of the next Unit Training Assembly after receiving the complaint.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 117 7.6.1.  If  the  complaint  analysis  determines  an  investigation  is  not  warranted,  the  IG conducting the complaint analysis must forward the results of the analysis, including a copy of  all  supporting  documents,  to  SAF/IGQ  through  their  MAJCOM,  NAF,  JFHQ,  FOA,  or DRU IG office.  (T-1). 7.6.1.1.  SAF/IGQ  will provide an interim response to complainants informing them the complaint analysis was forwarded to IG DoD for final determination.  IGs will not advise the complainant of the recommendation that was sent to IG DoD. 7.6.1.2.  SAF/IGQ will forward the complaint analysis to IG DoD for approval. 7.6.1.3.  If IG DoD agrees with the Air Force’s determination, they will notify SAF/IGQ who will in turn notify the MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG.  It is the responsibility of the  MAJCOM  (SAF/IGQ  for  ANG  cases),  FOA,  or  DRU  IG  to  notify  the  complainant there  is  insufficient  evidence  to  conduct  a  restriction  investigation  under  10  USC  1034.  (T-0).    Upon  case  closure,  the  MAJCOM  IGQs  will  notify  (via  ACTS)  the  IG  that conducted the complaint analysis.  (T-1). 7.6.1.4.  If  IG  DoD  disagrees  with  the  Air  Force’s  determination,  they  may  retain  the complaint for investigation or direct the Air Force to conduct an investigation.  SAF/IGQ will  normally  delegate  the  investigation  down  to  the  lowest-level  IG  office  through  the MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG. 7.6.2.  If the complaint analysis determines the allegation is not a case of restriction, analyze the  allegation  as  potential  abuse  of  authority  and  document  the  analysis  in  the  complaint analysis.  (T-1).  Use AFCRPSG attachment 19 for the acid test for abuse of authority in your analysis. 7.6.3.  To  the  maximum  extent  possible  the  complaint  analysis  should  focus  on  the  "Who, What,  When,  Where  and  How"  facts  of  possible  violations  of  standards  to  include  reprisal and restriction.  If after collecting these facts, the IG is unable to make a determination as to whether  prima  facie  evidence  exists  of  possible  wrong  doing  without  interviewing  the subject(s), then the IG will recommend to the Appointing Authority that an investigation be conducted.  (T-1).  IGs will not interview subjects during complaint analysis without written approval  from  the  Appointing  Authority.    IGs  serving  as  IOs  under  blanket  appointment letters  are  still  required  to  complete  a  documented  complaint  analysis  recommending investigation for Appointing Authority approval before conducting subject interviews unless given specific written authorization to do so in a particular case. 7.7.  Evaluating  Allegations  of  Restriction.  The IG or IO must follow the questions in  Table 7.2 in determining if the elements of restriction are present.  (T-1). Table 7.2.  Questions for use in Evaluating Restriction. 1  How did the RMO limit or attempt to limit the member’s access to an IG or a Member of Congress? 2  What was the intent of the RMO? (goes to what the message was) (1)  Reasons for restricting or taking actions that created barriers to making protected communications; (2)  Reasonableness of the RMO’s actions; (3)  Motive for the RMO’s action.  118 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 3  Would a reasonable person, under similar circumstances, believe he or she was actually restricted from making a lawful communication with the IG or a Member of Congress based on the RMO’s actions? NOTE:    Restriction  may  be  communicated  by  a  variety  of  means  (e.g.,  verbal,  written policy, regulation, order, procedure, counseling, or public statement) and may create a chilling effect. 7.8.  Investigating  Restriction  Complaints.  Restriction  investigations  will  be  conducted  IAW Chapters 3 of this instruction. 7.8.1.  If  IG  DoD  receives  a  complaint  directly  from  a  complainant,  then  IG  DoD  will conduct the complaint analysis.  If IG DoD tasks the Air Force to conduct the investigation they will forward the analysis and a tasking letter to  SAF/IGQ.  SAF/IGQ will forward the package to the MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG for proper handling of the complaint. 7.8.2.  IAW  DoDD  7050.06,  MAJCOM,  JFHQ,  FOA,  and  DRU  IGs  must  provide  an  180 Day  Notification  Letter  to  IG  DoD  (through  SAF/IGQ)  and  to  the  complainant  if  the investigation  is  not  completed  within  180  days  after  receipt  of  the  allegations.    (T-0).    The letters  must  include  the  reasons  for  the  delay  and  an  estimated  time  of  completion  for  the investigation.  IGs  must  also  comply  with  Air  Force  requirements  for  PUs  PRs  and  IRs  as specified in paragraphs 3.55 of this instruction.  (T-1).  Use the sample format in AFCRPSG attachment 12 for PRs. 7.8.3.  When  a  complainant  alleges  a  combination  of  reprisal,  and/or  restriction  within  the same  complaint,  IGs  must  ensure  all  applicable  reporting  requirements  for  reprisal  or restriction are completed IAW Chapters 6 or  7.  (T-1). 7.8.3.1.  Ensure the IO investigates all the issues associated with the reprisal or restriction allegation(s).  (T-1). 7.8.4.  All  restriction  investigations  containing  allegations  against  colonels  and  below  must have at least one legal review.  (T-1).  Additional reviews are optional but required if higher level  quality  review  indicates  the  need  for  an  additional  legal  review  or  if  an  addendum  is accomplished that alters the findings or significantly changes the analysis in the ROI. 7.8.5.  If the investigation determines the allegation does not meet the definition of restriction under 10 USC 1034, analyze the allegation as potential abuse of authority and document the analysis in the complaint analysis.  (T-1).  See AFCRPSG attachment 19 for the acid test for abuse of authority in your analysis. 7.9.  Reviewing and Approving Restriction Investigations.  IG DoD must review and approve all restriction investigations, regardless of the level where the investigation was conducted.  IGs must  mail  the  entire  case  file  (see  AFCRPSG  attachment  9)  to  SAF/IGQ  through  their MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG and transfer the case in ACTS.  (T-1). 7.9.1.  Appointing  authorities  may  notify  the  subject’s  commander  of  the  investigation findings when they approve the case, but must inform them that final findings could change because final approval and review rests with IG DoD.  (T-1).  Commanders should wait until after  IG  DoD  has  approved  the  Report  of  Investigation  to  take  command  action  unless  the  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 119 action taken is based on other issues discovered during the investigation that do not include reprisal or restriction. 7.9.2.  IGs  must  provide  an  IR  to  complainants  informing  them  the  investigation  has  been completed  and  forwarded  to  IG  DoD  for  final  approval.    (T-1).    Do  not  inform  the complainant  of investigation  findings  (i.e.,  substantiated  or  not substantiated).  (T-1). the  unapproved 7.9.3.  Before forwarding the case file to SAF/IGQ, MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA and DRU IGs will conduct a QR.  (T-1). 7.9.4.  SAF/IGQ will conduct a quality review, IAW paragraph 3.72, prior to forwarding the case to IG DoD. 7.9.5.  Follow  the  procedures  specified  in  section(s)    3N  and/or    3O  of  this  instruction  if, during  higher-level  quality  review,  deficiencies  are  identified  or  the  reviewing  official disagrees with the findings. 7.10.  Final  Approval  and  Notification  Requirements.  IG  DoD  will  notify  SAF/IGQ  upon final approval of the investigation’s findings. 7.10.1.  SAF/IGQ  will  provide  a  copy  of  IG  DoD’s  final  approval  to  the  applicable MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU IG.  (T-1). 7.10.2.  The  MAJCOM  (SAF/IGQ  for  ANG),  FOA,  or  DRU  IG  will  provide  the  final response  to  the  complainant  within  30  days  after  IG  DoD’s  approval  of  the  findings  as mandated by 10 USC 1034.  (T-0).  The MAJCOM IG will provide the installation IG a copy of the final response memo to the complainant, when applicable.  (T-0). 7.10.2.1.  MAJCOM  (SAF/IGQ  for  ANG),  FOA,  and  DRU  IGs  will  provide  a  redacted copy of the ROI (and addendum, if any) with the final response to the complainant.  (T-1).    The  ROI  should  be  redacted  using  exceptions  allowed  by  the  FOIA,  however,  no coordination  with  the  FOIA  office  is  required.    Additionally,  IGs  have  the  authority (under 10 USC 1034) to act on complainant requests for additional documentation from restriction investigations without going through the FOIA office. 7.10.2.2.  MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU IGs will provide SAF/IGQ with a copy of the final response to the complainant. 7.10.3.  MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU IGs will forward a copy of IG DoD final approval of the investigation to the applicable Appointing Authority.  The Appointing Authority must notify the subject’s commander of the final investigation findings but will not provide a copy of IG DoD’s letter to the commander.  The commander will notify the subject. 7.10.4.  IAW DoDD 7050.06, paragraph 6.3.8, a copy of command/corrective action must be provided to IG DoD.  When command/corrective action is finalized, IGs will obtain a copy to include  any  rebuttal  statements;  if  action  is  verbal  or  no  action  is  taken,  IGs  will  obtain  a written  description  of  the  action  from  the  commander.    (T-1).    IGs  will  forward  these documents  to  SAF/IGQ  through  their  MAJCOM,  NAF,  JFHQ,  FOA,  or  DRU  IG,  within  7 duty days of becoming aware of such action being completed.  (T-1).  SAF/IGQ will forward the information to IG DoD.  120 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 7.10.5.  IGs  will  close  restriction  complaints  IAW  established  procedures  as  described  in Chapter 3 of this instruction.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 121 Chapter 8 CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRIES 8.1.  Governing Directive.  AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations with Congress, provides guidance and  procedures  for  Air  Force  personnel  who  respond  to  inquiries  from  and  interact  with Congress. 8.2.  Sources for Congressional Inquiries. 8.2.1.  Congressional Inquiries from LLM through Functional Channels.  The Congressional Inquiry and Travel Division (SAF/LLM) is the Air Force focal point for constituent-related congressional  inquiries.    As  such,  SAF/LLM  processes,  tasks,  coordinates,  and  distributes final replies to inquiries forwarded to the Air Force by members of Congress or their staff on behalf of their constituents. 8.2.2.

Preventing FWA is the primary focus of the Air Force FWA Program. 10.4.  FWA Policy.  It is against Air Force policy for any military member or civilian employee to engage in fraud, waste or abuse.  The Air Force policy on FWA is to use all available means to prevent, detect, and correct instances of FWA; to appropriately discipline perpetrators involved in FWA activities; and to recoup, if possible, losses of cash, property, and services resulting from FWA.  The primary elements of a FWA prevention and detection program exist within the Air Force in the audit, inspection, investigation, legal, and security areas. 10.4.1.  The  success  of  the  FWA  program  lies  with  each  individual  within  the  Air  Force. Support by both military and civilian members is crucial in preventing and eliminating FWA.  Any individual aware of FWA or lack of controls that could permit resources to be wasted or diverted must report the situation through appropriate channels. 10.5.

AFI  14-104,  Oversight  of  Intelligence  Activities,  establishes guidance  related  to  the  conduct  of  intelligence  oversight  activities.    DoDD  5240.1,  DoD Intelligence  Activities,  27  Aug  2007,  DOD  5240.1-R  Procedures  Governing  the  Activities  of DoD  Intelligence  Components  that  Affect  United  States  Persons,  7  Dec  1982,  Directive  Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-011, Intelligence Oversight Policy Guidance, 26 Nov 2008, DTM 08-052,  DoD  Guidance  for  Reporting  Questionable  Intelligence  Activities  and  Significant  and Highly  Sensitive  Matters,  17  Jun  2009.    Questionable  intelligence  activities  and  significant  or highly  sensitive  matters  involving  intelligence  activities  may  have  serious  implications  for  the execution of DoD missions.  Submission of reports of questionable intelligence activities and all significant or highly sensitive matters IAW AFI 14-104, Oversight of Intelligence Activities. 12.2.  Key  Terms.  This  chapter  uses  the  following  key  terms:  intelligence  activity,  DoD intelligence component, and United States Person.  Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms. 12.3.  Background.  Intelligence  oversight  involves  a  balancing  of  two  fundamental  interests: obtaining  the  intelligence  information  required  to  protect  national  security  and  protecting individual  rights  guaranteed  by  the  Constitution  and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  (US).  The primary  objective  of  the  Intelligence  Oversight  Program  is  to  ensure  that  units  and  staff organizations  conducting  intelligence  activities  do  not  infringe  on  or  violate  the  rights  of  US persons.    However,  it  is  important  to  note  the  program  applies  to  all  intelligence  activities whether they deal with US person information or not. Inspectors General at all levels need to be cognizant  of  intelligence  oversight  policies  and  requirements.    An  intelligence  oversight complaint, often referred to as a questionable activity, is an allegation of conduct that constitutes, or is related to, an intelligence activity that may violate the law, an Executive Order, Presidential Directive,  DoD  policy  regarding  intelligence  activities,  AFI  14-104,  and/or  other  Air  Force policy documents and instructions.  This includes activities of any Air Force organization, even if not specifically identified as an intelligence activity, that is being used for counterintelligence or  foreign  intelligence  purposes.    It  includes  improper  activities  by  an  intelligence  or counterintelligence  unit  or  staff  or  personnel  assigned  to  the  organization.    A  complainant alleging an intelligence  oversight  violation might  assert  something like, ”Some US  intelligence organization  is  collecting  information  on  me  for  no  reason.”    AFI  14-104  directs  that  ”reports (regarding  potential  intelligence  oversight  violations)  will  be  expeditiously  provided  to  the inspector  general  at  the  first  level  at  which  an  inspector  general  is  assigned  and  not  associated with the questionable activity, with copies to the servicing SJA office and, unless the inspector general determines such reporting would not be appropriate, to senior intelligence officers at the same  level.”      Therefore,  IGs  at  all  organizational  levels  must  be  prepared  to  receive  and  then forward  copies  of  intelligence  oversight  complaints.    IGs  assigned  to  DoD  intelligence components in the Air Force must be prepared to investigate such complaints.     132 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 12.4.  SAF/IG Responsibilities.  SAF/IG will: 12.4.1.  SAF/IGI  will  report  any  activities  that  may  indicate  an  intelligence  oversight violation  to  DoD  General  Counsel,  SAF/  GC,  AF/A2  ,  AF/JA,  and  the  Assistant  to  the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Oversight (ATSD(I)), per AFI 14-104. 12.4.2.  SAF/IGQ will ensure the appropriate AF unit investigates allegations of intelligence oversight violations. 12.5.  MAJCOM, NAF, JFHQ, FOA, and DRU IG Responsibilities.  IGs will: 12.5.1.

(T-1).    According  to  those  Air Force  Records  Disposition  Schedule  tables,  the  disposition  of  some  IG  documents  is  based on  the  date  the  case  ”closed.”    IG  offices  will  use  the  definition  of  “closure”  as  listed  in Attachment 1 of this instruction to determine the case ”closed“ date. available internet the on  The schedule is 13.7.3.  In  order  to  maintain  a  record  of  each  complaint  and  its  disposition,  all  IG  contacts (including  referrals,  transfers,  assistance,  investigations,  and  dismissals)  must  be  logged  in ACTS.  (T-1). 13.7.3.1.  Each  case/complaint  is  its  own  record.    If  paper  records  are  maintained,  the case file should normally be filed by ACTS File Reference Number  (FRNO) in its own individual file folder until electronic copies can be loaded into ACTS. 13.7.4.  Case  records  should  not  include  AFOSI  reports  (unless  they  are  investigations against senior officials or colonels (or civil servant Grade 15) or substantiated against majors or lieutenant colonels), classified materials, reports of special security investigations, or other similarly sensitive documents.  If a case must contain sensitive documents (other than AFOSI reports as specified above), IGs must cross-reference their identifying number or subject and indicate their primary storage location.  (T-1).  Do not retain them in the local IG office file.  (T-1). 13.7.5.  Do not file any IG complaint correspondence or related documents in an individual’s unit Personal Information File, field personnel records, or a system of records other than the system established for IG records.

(T-2). 13.7.7.1.  If command action was taken, coordinate with the servicing SJA office before erasing,  demagnetizing,  or  destroying  audio  tapes  or  computer  storage  media  to determine if they must be retained for a longer period.  (T-2). 13.7.7.2.  If  tapes  are  erased  and  degaussed,  use  a  professional  demagnetizing/erasing machine.    (T-2).    All  identifiable  markings  must  be  removed  after  erasing.    Never  tape  136 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 over  previous  recordings  or  reuse  an  audiotape  unless  previous  data  has  been  properly erased. 13.7.7.3.  If  testimony  has  been  recorded  on  computer  media,  appropriate  technical procedures will be utilized to ensure the testimony is unrecoverable.  (T-3). 13.7.8.  Digital records (e.g., DVDs and CDs). 13.7.8.1.  Destroy according to local Information Security Program guidelines.  (T-3). 13.7.9.  AF  Electronic  Records  Management.    Records  attached  to  ACTS  case  files  will follow guidelines IAW AFI 33-322, Records Management Program.  (T-1). 13.7.10.  Referral  Completion  Reports  (RCR)  are  IG  records.    The  template  should  be properly marked as IG records when referred to the agency for action. Section 13C—Restriction for Use of IG Records 13.8.  Restrictions for Use of IG Records.  IG records are subject to the following restrictions. 13.8.1.  Do not use IG records as attachments or exhibits to other official records without the written approval of the authority responsible for making release determinations, as delegated in this instruction.  (T-1). 13.8.2.  IG  records  must  be  returned  to  the  authority  responsible  for  making  release determinations or properly destroyed upon completion of stated need.  (T-3). 13.8.3.  Do  not  further  release  (in  whole  or  in  part)  IG  documents  without  proper authorization from the authority responsible for making release determinations.  (T-3). 13.8.4.  Do not act on FOIA or PA requests for IG records.  (T-2).  If, while possessing an IG document,  an  office  receives  a  FOIA  or  PA  request,  and  if  the  document  is  a  responsive record, then accomplish a referral of the request to the appropriate authority responsible for making release determinations (referral procedures are found at DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, paragraph C1.5.9).  Include a copy of any responsive documents in the referral package.  (T-3).  The authority responsible for making release determinations acts on the request. 13.8.5.  Comply  with  the  provisions  of  the  PA  Program  in  the  management  of  IG  records.  (T-0). 13.8.6.  Comply  with  the  provisions  and  restrictions  of  10  USC  1102  and  AFI  44-119  in using any records obtained from a Surgeon General quality assurance review.  (T-0).  These are records generated by federal hospital committees in reviewing the quality and standards of care provided to patients treated by the medical facility.  Ordinarily, these records should be reviewed and returned to the originator without being attached to the IG record.  Consult your servicing SJA office before attaching any quality assurance documents to an IG report.  If a quality assurance record (or any portion of a record) is included in an IG record, ensure it is prominently marked as protected by 10 USC 1102 as a quality assurance document.  (T-0). 13.8.7.  See  DoD  6025.18R,  paragraph  C.2.3.,  for  applicability  of  the  Health  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to IG operations.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 137 Section 13D—Official Use Requests (OUR) 13.9.  Types of OURs.  This section covers the following types of OURs: 13.9.1.  For Command action. 13.9.1.1.  By commander. 13.9.1.2.  By legal counsel. 13.9.2.  For other than command action. 13.9.2.1.

Non-governmental agencies. 13.10.  Release  Determination  for  OURs.  SAF/IG  is  the  authority  responsible  for  making release  determinations  for  all  IG  records  requested  under  OUR.    SAF/IG  makes  the  following delegations: 13.10.1.  Senior  official  investigation  records:    The  Director,  SAF/IGS,  or  designee,  is  the authority  responsible  for  making  release  determinations  for  senior  official  investigation records. 13.10.2.  Colonel  (or  civil  servant  Grade  15)  and  below:    The  Director,  SAF/IGQ,  or designee, is the authority responsible for making release determinations for colonel (or civil servant Grade 15) and below IG investigative records. 13.10.3.  Command  action:    Appointing  authorities  are  responsible  for  making  release determinations for requests regarding command action resulting from IG investigations.  (T-2).    NOTE:    This  only  applies  to  requests  for  command  action  and  not  other  types  of requests. 13.10.4.  The  commander,  not  the  IG,  is  the  authority  responsible  for  making  release determinations for CDI reports.  (T-2).  IG offices will not be the repository for CDI reports. Commanders or their designated representatives maintain CDI reports/records. 13.11.  Policy  and  Procedure  for  all  OURs.  OURs  must  be  submitted  through  MAJCOM, NAF,  JFHQ,  FOA,  or  DRU  IG  offices  to  the  appropriate  authority  responsible  for  making release determinations.  (T-2).  In every case, the following guidance applies: 13.11.1.  Release of IG records pursuant to OURs will ordinarily be made after case closure (see paragraph 3.63 for closure requirements). 13.11.2.  To make an OUR for IG records, requestors must: 13.11.2.1.  Submit requests in writing.  (T-1). 13.11.2.2.  Identify  the  records  requested  as  specifically  as  possible  (e.g.,  date  of investigation, name of IO, subject, and/or complainant).  (T-1). 13.11.2.3.  Explain in detail why the records are needed.  (T-1).  138 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 13.11.2.4.  Specify when the records are needed.  (T-1). 13.11.3.  The  authority  responsible  for  making  release  determinations  will  evaluate  OURs based  on  the  criteria  in  Section  13E  and  must  notify  the  requestor  of  any  applicable restrictions  on  the  information  provided  in  the  release.    Make  entries  in  ACTS  to  show processing of OURs for IG records. 13.11.4.  Maintenance  of  OUR  Records.    Records  will  be  retained  IAW  the  AF  Records Disposition Schedule in AFRIMS. for  Command  Action.  The  authority 13.12.  OURs responsible  for  making  release determinations will automatically provide the subject’s commander with  a copy of the relevant portions  of  an  approved  and  substantiated  report  of  investigation  (without  attachments)  for determining  appropriate  command  action.    (T-1).    JAs  may  act  on  behalf  of  the  commander regarding  the  procedures  of  Section  13C.    Commanders  submit  an  OUR  to  the  authority responsible for making release determinations to:  a) seek approval to release relevant portions of the ROI or case file to the subject, and/or; b) obtain additional portions of the case file beyond the information initially provided by the authority responsible for making release determinations. When  possible,  the  authority  responsible  for  making  release  determinations  should  provide  the information to the commander, and specify what is releasable to the subject simultaneously.  For Senior Official cases, see Chapter 4. 13.12.1.  Release to Subject. 13.12.1.1.  Refer to AFI 51-202 when providing evidence in an Article 15 action against an active duty person.  Refer to AFI 36-704 when providing evidence relied on to support command action against DoD civilians. 13.12.1.2.  Commanders  will  provide  the  subject  with  evidence  (if  any)  supporting  the command action in conjunction with the notice of the action.  (T-1).  NOTE:  Evidence to support the command action includes information favorable to the defense and may range from no evidence to all the evidence collected. 13.12.1.3.  Defense  Counsel  Requests.    When  defense  counsel  requests  IG  records  to represent  military  members  in  courts-martial  or  other  disciplinary  actions,  defense counsel  must  request  the  records  from  the  servicing  SJA  office  who  will  decide  what records are relevant for the defense counsel to obtain.  (T-2).  IGs should cooperate with any request by the servicing SJA office to provide IG records. 13.12.2.  Obtaining  additional  portions  of  the  case  file.    If  a  commander  determines  it  is necessary  to  review  additional  portions  of  the  case  file  (e.g.,  witness  testimony  and/or exhibits) to determine appropriate command action, the commander must submit an OUR to the authority responsible for making release determinations (sample at AFCRPSG attachment 22).    (T-1).    The  authority  responsible  for  making  release  determinations  will  approve  or disapprove  the  request  with  a  memorandum  like  the  one  at  AFCRPSG  attachment  23  and must use the wording in paragraphs two, three, and four verbatim.  (T-1). 13.13.  Requests from AF/A1.  AF/ A1 is charged with the responsibility to advise the Secretary whether  officers  being  recommended  for  promotion,  who  have  adverse  information,  meet  the exemplary conduct standards prescribed in title 10 United States Code, section 8583.  In order to  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 139 do  so,  they  must  have  access  to  relevant  IG  records.    Process  requests  under  this  provision  as expeditiously as possible. 13.14.  Requests from within DoD. 13.14.1.  All  record  requests  from  within  DoD,  such  as  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of Defense,  the  Inspector  General  of  the  Department  of  Defense  (IG  DoD),  the  Joint  Staff, unified  commands,  defense  agencies  and  field  activities,  and  the  other  Service  components (including the Reserve Components), must be forwarded to SAF/IG.  (T-1). 13.14.2.  IG DoD must have expeditious and unrestricted access to and, when required, must be  able  to  obtain  copies  of  all  records,  reports,  investigations,  audits,  reviews,  documents, papers, recommendations, or other material available to or within any DoD component. 13.14.3.  AFBCMR  Cases.    Complainants  who  petition  the  AFBCMR  should  advise  the AFBCMR if relevant  IG records exist.  The AFBCMR may submit an OUR to  SAF/IG for those records as it deems appropriate. 13.15.  Requests  from  Government  Agencies  Outside  the  DoD,  Except  Congress.  Official use requests for IG records received from non-DoD governmental agencies must be forwarded to the appropriate authority responsible for making release determinations.  (T-2).  This paragraph does not apply to congressional requests, which are addressed in paragraph 13.16. 13.16.  Requests From Congress. 13.16.1.  There  are  three  types  of  requests  from  Congress:    committee  requests,  constituent requests,  and  other  requests.    Consult  AFPD  90-4  and  AFI  90-401  for  all  congressional requests.  Process all ”constituent” requests through SAF/LLM.  If members of Congress or committee staff members request a  copy of the  report itself or information on any  opinion, conclusion,  recommendation,  or  confidential  source  in  the  report,  advise  the  congressional member their request will be sent to SAF/LL. 13.16.2.  To the greatest  extent possible, ask the congressional  requestor to accept  a factual summary in lieu of the IG record. 13.16.3.  Committee  Requests.    The  Air  Force  must  disclose  IG  records  when  properly requested by a Congressional committee.  EXCEPTION:  These procedures do not apply to classified information (see AFI 90-401 for procedures involving classified information).  The requirements for a proper congressional committee request are: 13.16.3.1.  The request is from either house of Congress, a committee, a subcommittee, a joint committee, or a subcommittee of a joint committee (5 USC 552a(b)(9)); 13.16.3.2.  For a matter within their jurisdiction (5 USC 552a(b)(9)); 13.16.3.3.  From the chairman of the committee or the ranking minority member (AFI 90-401).  There is no requirement the chairman sign the request, a letter from a staff member requesting records on behalf of the committee chairperson (or ranking minority member) for  the  committee  is  sufficient.    Assuming  these  requirements  are  met,  SAF/IGQ  or SAF/IGS  must  turn  over  all  portions  of  the  file  that  were  requested  (unredacted)  and include a transmittal letter specifying: the portion of the information that is protected by the  Privacy  Act,  the  need  to  safeguard  the  information,  and  that  the  information  should  140 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 not  be  further  released  (5  USC  552a(b);  32  CFR  §  310.40(c);  AFI  33-332;  and  DoDD 5400.11). 13.16.4.  Constituent  Requests.    Frequently,  members  of  Congress  ask  for  information regarding a constituent based on the constituent’s request for assistance.  There are two types of  constituent  requests:  those  for  general  information  and  those  for  sensitive  information.  Responses  to  both  types  of  requests  are  authorized  by  the  blanket  routine  use  for Congressional Inquiries in the AF Privacy Act System notices. 13.16.4.1.  General  Information.   Requests from  a congressional  member on behalf of a constituent for general information may be answered without permission from the subject of the record that will be disclosed (5 USC 552a(b)(3); see also AFI 33-332, for examples of general information).  IG records typically contain sensitive, not general information. 13.16.4.2.  Sensitive  Information.    If  the  information  requested  by  a  congressional representative  is  sensitive,  a  release  from  the  subject  of  the  information  involved  is required  (AFI  33-332).    (T-1).    Some  congressional  representatives  will  provide  the release with the request.  The more sensitive the records, the more carefully  you should verify  the  subject’s  consent  to  the  release  (AFI  33-332).    If  the  request  is  for  sensitive information,  and  no  release  is  provided,  you  may  only  provide  whatever  information  is releasable under the FOIA (which could  be  all, some, or none of the  requested record).  In those cases, see Section 13E to determine what information may be released. 13.16.5.  Other Requests.  All other requests from members of Congress are analyzed under the Privacy Act, which permits disclosure of Privacy Act records only when required by the FOIA  (See  5  USC  552;  also  see  AFI  33-332,  which  sets  out  a  test  for  disclosure  to  third parties).  All other congressional requests are analyzed under the FOIA. (This does not mean the  request  must  be  submitted  under  FOIA,  just  that  FOIA  analysis  will  be  used.)    The authority  responsible  for  making  release  determinations  must  consult  their  servicing  SJA office  before  responding  to  these  requests.    Prior  to  release  of  these  requests,  ensure  the accuracy of the information in the record. 13.17.  Requests  from  Non-Governmental  Agencies.  Any  office  that  receives  a  request  for records from a non-governmental agency should forward the request to the authority responsible for making release determinations for that record, along with a copy of the responsive records. Section 13E—Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA) Requests 13.18.  Authority  Responsible  for  Making  Release  Determinations  for  FOIA  and  PA Requests. 13.18.1.  SAF/IG is the initial denial authority (IDA) for all  IG records requested IAW DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN  33-302,  Freedom  of  Information  Act  and  the  denial  authority  for  IG records requested under AFI 33-332.  SAF/IG makes the following delegations: 13.18.1.1.  SAF/IGS is the IDA for senior official cases. 13.18.1.2.  SAF/IGQ  is  the  IDA  for  all  IG  cases  closed  at  SAF/IGQ  level  and  for  all colonel (or civil servant Grade 15) IG investigations regardless of the level at which they were initiated or closed.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 141 13.18.2.  MAJCOM,  JFHQ,  FOA,  or  DRU  IGs  are  the  authority  responsible  for  making release  determinations  for  IG  records  when  this  instruction  governs  those  records,  and pertains to IG actions closed at their level and below.  (T-1).  EXCEPTIONS: 13.18.2.1.  Colonel (or civil servant Grade 15) cases as specified in paragraph 13.18.1.2 above. 13.18.2.2.  SAF/IGQ will act as the MAJCOM for ANG IG records maintenance. 13.18.2.3.  Reports  involving  Air  Reserve  Component  personnel.    Reports  involving members  of  the  Reserve  Component  in  Title  10  status  (e.g.,  on  active  duty)  should  be maintained in federal records.  Reports involving members of the Reserve Component in Title 32 status (e.g., in state status), even if the report is done by investigating officers in Title  10  status  should  be  forwarded  to  the  state  unit  involved.    The  federal  government should retain a copy of these records when there is  a federal  interest.   State records are not  subject  to  the  FOIA  or  PA,  rather  they  are  subject  to  state  law.    This  can  be  a complicated situation-- consult the servicing SJA office. 13.18.2.4.  SAF/IGQ  will  maintain  reports  involving  members  of  the  Civil  Air  Patrol (CAP)  while  performing  Air  Force-assigned  missions  (AFAM).    Otherwise,  inspector general investigations and reports involving CAP members while serving or performing missions  in  its  federal  chartered  non-profit  corporate  status  are  subject  to  the  direction and control of its governing instructions. 13.18.3.  MAJCOM, JFHQ, FOA, or DRU  IGs must coordinate all proposed FOIA  and PA responses with their FOIA and servicing SJA offices.  (T-1). 13.19.  Procedures Regarding FOIA and PA Requests. 13.19.1.  IGs  will  coordinate  FOIA  requests  with  the  FOIA  office  and  the  servicing  SJA office.  (T-1).  See DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302 for FOIA responsibilities.  Make entries in ACTS to show processing of FOIA requests. 13.19.2.  When a FOIA request is received from  a complainant and “complainant provided” materials are responsive records to the request, if possible, contact the complainant to clarify if he or she is requesting ”complainant provided“ materials.  After clarification, annotate the complainant  wishes  in  the  FOIA  file.    If  clarification  does  not  occur,  process  the ”complainant  provided”  materials  and  include  releasable  portions  with  response  to complainant. 13.19.3.  Requests from individuals will be considered under both the FOIA and PA.  (T-2).  In  the  response  to  the  requestor,  specify  which  act  afforded  them  access  to  the  maximum amount  of  information  (FOIA  or  PA),  and  explain  any  exemptions  or  exceptions.    (T-2).  NOTE:  Documents released pursuant to a FOIA request are then public documents and may be further disclosed at the recipient’s discretion. 13.20.  Maintenance  of  FOIA  Records.  Maintain  IG  FOIA  files  IAW  the  Air  Force  Records Disposition Schedule, and ; DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302. 13.20.1.  The  authority  responsible  for  making  release  determinations  is  responsible  for documentation, maintenance, and disposition of IG records processed under FOIA.  (T-2).  142 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 13.20.2.  IG  FOIA  case  files,  including  the  initial  response  package  and  subsequent  appeal package, if any, should be maintained within the IG file system under the ACTS FRNO. 13.20.3.  If  any  material  is  denied  to  a  FOIA  or  PA  requestor,  then  a  record  must  be maintained for six years.  (T-2).  NOTE:  The FOIA/PA file is an independent file from the investigatory file.  The record must contain the release and its justification, coordination, and any  analysis  or  legal  reviews,  a  highlighted  redacted  copy  of  released  materials  showing information withheld from release, and a full and unredacted copy of responsive documents (IAW ; DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302).  If the FOIA or PA request is granted in full, the information must be maintained for two years. 13.20.4.  The  original  investigative  file  will  be  destroyed  on  its  scheduled  disposition  date.  (T-1). Section 13F—Making Release Determinations 13.21.  General Guidance. 13.21.1.  All  FOIA  or  PA  responses  must  be  coordinated  with  the  servicing  SJA  office.  Denials require a written legal review.  (T-1). 13.21.2.  Requests  by  an  individual  (complainant  or  subject)  for  their  own  records  must  be considered  under  both  the  FOIA  and  the  PA,  even  if  the  requestor  does  not  cite  either  act (See    DoD  5400.7-R_AFMAN  33-302  and  AFI  33-332).    (T-0).    This  does  not  mean  the person receives a copy; it only means both acts must be considered. 13.21.3.  Generally, release of IG records under FOIA or PA will be made only after the case has  been  closed.    Respond  to  requests  for  open  cases  citing  the  appropriate  FOIA  or  PA exemptions and exceptions after consulting with your servicing SJA office.  (T-0).  Although a search and the production of all responsive documents must be accomplished pursuant to a FOIA  request,  the  release  of  documents  associated  with  an  open/ongoing  investigation  to  a FOIA  requester  will  usually  be  denied  under  FOIA  Exemptions  (7)(a)  and  (7)(c)  because release  of  investigative  documents  prior  to  a  final  decision  by  the  decision  authority  may compromise the integrity of the investigation and investigative process. 13.21.4.  The  authority  responsible  for  making  release  determinations  will  always  comply with valid court orders for an in-camera review.  (T-0). 13.21.5.  In  cases  of  reprisal  and  restriction,  DoDD  7050.06  requires  the  IG  to  provide  the complainant with a redacted copy of the Report of Investigation with the closure letter.  (T-0).    The  ROI  must  be  considered  under  both  the  FOIA  and  the  PA  but  notification  to  the FOIA office is not required.  (T-0). 13.22.  Release Analysis. 13.22.1.  For guidance on analysis of FOIA or PA requests, refer to: http://www.foia.af.mil/, http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foia_guide09.htm, http://dpclo.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNsIndex/tabid/5915/Category/277/Page/10/Default.aspx, https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 143 Chapter 14 CIVIL LIBERTIES 14.1.  Governing  Directives.  Public  Law  110-53,  Section  803.  AFI  33-332,  The  Air  Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program. 14.2.  Key  Terms.  This  chapter  uses  the  following  key  terms:    civil  liberties,  reprisal,  and restriction.  Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of these key terms. 14.3.  Overview.  Based  on  a  recommendation  from  the  9/11  Commission,  Congress  passed Public Law 110-53, Section 803 in 2007 requiring certain Federal agencies, to include the DoD, to  periodically  (not  less  than  quarterly)  report  allegations  of  civil  liberties  violations  and resolution, provide training on civil liberties to agency personnel, and ensure agency policies and regulations did not violate the civil liberties of agency personnel and the public. 14.4.  Civil  Liberties.  Civil Liberties are the rights of individuals to exercise the freedoms and rights  guaranteed  to  them  under  the  United  States  Constitution  without  the  government’s improper interference.  For purposes of the Air Force Civil Liberties Program, Civil Liberties are considered to be: 14.4.1.  First  Amendment  Rights:    freedom  of  religion;  freedom  of  speech  or  of  the  press; right to peaceably assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. 14.4.2.  Second Amendment:  right to keep and bear arms. 14.4.3.  Fourth Amendment:  right against unreasonable searches and seizures. 14.4.4.  Fifth  Amendment:    prohibition  against  deprivation  of  life,  liberties,  or  property, without due process of law. 14.4.5.  Fifteenth, Nineteenth and Twenty Sixth Amendments:  right to vote. 14.5.  Identifying Civil Liberties Violations.  Regardless of the subject matter of the complaint, IGs will determine if the complaint constitutes a civil liberties violation.  If the complaint meets the criteria for a civil liberties violation, the IG will: 14.5.1.  Determine the appropriate disposition of the issue(s) contained in the complaint.  (T-0). 14.5.2.  Enter the details of the complaint in ACTS, ensuring that Civil Liberties is selected as a Special Interest Item.  (T-1). 14.5.3.  Draft a Civil Liberties Report (AFCRPSG attachment 26) and attach to the case file.  (T-1). 14.5.4.  Update the report as the resolution of the complaint progresses.  (T-1). 14.5.5.  Close the case in ACTS when the issue(s) has been resolved.  (T-1). 14.6.  Reporting Requirements. 14.6.1.  AFI 33-332 requires SAF/IG to submit a quarterly civil liberties report to SAF/A6PP by the 8th day of the month following the end of the quarter.  In order to meet this suspense,  144 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 SAF/IGQ will pull the reports of complaints initiated, pending or closed from ACTS for the quarter no later than the 3rd of January, April, July and October. 14.6.2.  Civil liberty complaints made during courts-martial, non-judicial punishment actions, administrative  discharge  processes,  or  IG  complaints  of  reprisal  or  restriction  will  not  be reported by the IG as they are reported through other channels.  (T-1). 14.6.3.  Negative replies from the installations/units are not required. 14.7.  Reprisal for Making a Complaint.  In accordance with Public Law 110-53 Section 803, no action constituting a reprisal or threat of reprisal shall be taken for making a complaint or for disclosing  information  to  a  privacy  officer  or  civil  liberties  officer  that  indicates  a  possible violation  of  privacy  protections  or  civil  liberties  unless  the  complaint  was  disclosed  with  false information or with willful disregard for its truth or falsity. 14.7.1.  Complaints alleging reprisal  will be evaluated in  accordance  with  Chapter 6 of this instruction.  (T-1). 14.8.  Additional  Information.  Additional  information  can  be  found  at  the  DoD  website (http://dpclo.defense.gov) or the AF website (http://www.privacy.af.mil/civilliberties/).  AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 145 Chapter 15 OSC INVESTIGATIONS 15.1.  Governing  Directives.  AFI  51-1102,  Cooperation  with  the  Office  of  Special  Counsel; DoDD 5500.19,  Cooperation with the United States Office of Special Counsel. 15.2.  Key  Terms.  This  chapter  uses  the  following  key  terms:    whistleblowing,  prohibited personnel  practices,  gross  mismanagement,  gross  waste  of  funds,  abuse  of  authority,  and  a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.  Refer to Attachment 1 for definition of these key terms. 15.3.  Overview.  The  U.S.  Office  of  Special  Counsel  (OSC)  is  an  independent  federal investigative  and prosecutorial  agency whose primary  mission is  to  safeguard the merit system by  protecting  federal  employees  and  applicants  from  prohibited  personnel  practices  (PPPs), especially reprisal for whistleblowing.  OSC investigates PPPs, as well as certain other types of cases such as allegations of violations of the Hatch Act and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights  Act  (USERRA).   Additionally, the OSC Disclosure Unit  provides a secure channel for federal employees to report wrongdoing.  Disclosure allegations received by OSC  are  reviewed  and,  if  OSC  determines  there  is  a  substantial  likelihood  of  a  violation  of  a rule,  law,  or  regulation;  gross  mismanagement;  gross  waste  of  funds;  abuse  of  authority;  or  a substantial danger to public health or safety, OSC will refer the allegations to the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) for investigation.  SECAF is  then required to  conduct  an investigation and submit a report back to OSC.  See 5 U.S.C. § 1213. 15.3.1.  SECAF  has  delegated  responsibility  for  oversight  and  overall  guidance  of  OSC matters  to  the  Air  Force  General  Counsel  (SAF/GC).    Responses  to  queries  or  requests  for information by OSC must be routed through SAF/GCA. 15.3.2.  At the request of SAF/GC, SAF/IG shall investigate the allegations referred by OSC.  Results  of  OSC  inquiries  investigated  by  AF  IGs  will  be  routed  through  SAF/IGQ  to SAF/GCA. 15.4.  Investigative Process. 15.4.1.  For allegations referred to SECAF by OSC for investigation, the statutory suspense to  submit  the  final  report  to  OSC  is  60  days  (see  5  U.S.C.  §  1213(c)(1)(B).    (T-0).  Extensions are granted only for extenuating circumstances.  As such, investigations referred by OSC must be given the highest appropriate priority. 15.4.2.  SAF/IG will refer the OSC allegations to a designated point of contact in SAF/IGQ, SAF/IGS, or SAF/IGX as appropriate.  The designated point of contact and a lawyer assigned from  HAF/JAA  as  the  legal  advisor  will  review  the  allegations  and  recommend  to  SAF/IG whether the investigation should be conducted at the Air Force or MAJCOM level. 15.4.3.  The  investigating  officer  will  consult  with  the  SAF/IG  point  of  contact,  AF  legal advisor, and SAF/GCA representative to draft allegations, develop an investigation plan, and draft the report of investigation (ROI) for SECAF signature.  (T-1).  To the extent possible before the ROI is finalized, evidence and testimony obtained during the investigation should be  shared  as  soon  as  practical  with  the  AF  legal  advisor  and  SAF/GCA  representative  to assist in meeting the 60 day statutory suspense.  146 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 15.4.4.  The investigating officer will document the investigation in the OSC format for the ROI (AFCRPSG Attachment 27).  (T-0).  This format differs from the IG ROI and must be followed.  (T-0). 15.4.5.  The report must include: 15.4.5.1.  A  summary  of  the  information  with  respect  to  which  the  investigation  was initiated.  (T-0). 15.4.5.2.  A description of the conduct of the investigation.  (T-0). 15.4.5.3.  A summary of the evidence.  (T-0). 15.4.5.4.  A listing of any violation or apparent violation of any law, rule, or regulation.  (T-0). 15.4.5.5.  A  description  of  any  corrective  action  taken  or  planned  as  a  result  of  the investigation.  (T-0). 15.5.  Review and Approval. 15.5.1.  The completed case file must be reviewed by the SAF/IG designated point of contact and a legal review written prior to release to SAF/GCA.  (T-0). 15.5.2.  SAF/GCA  will  review  and  may  request  further  information  and/or  investigation. SAF/GCA will submit the final report for SECAF signature and forwarding to OSC. 15.5.3.  SECAF personally signs the final report submitted to OSC. 15.5.4.  Case  will  be  carried  in  a  completed  status  until  OSC  finishes  their  report  at  which time the case status will be changed to closed.  (T-1). 15.6.  Actions by OSC 15.6.1.  OSC  will  send  the  SECAF  response  to  the  complainants  for  them  to  review  and make comments  regarding the investigation.   Based on the  comments,  OSC may return the report to the Air Force for clarification or further investigation. 15.6.2.  The  final  OSC  report  will  be  sent  to  the  President  and  Congress  and  posted  on  the OSC public website, http://www.osc.gov. GREGORY A.

When  not  otherwise  prohibited  by  superior  competent  authority,  an officer’s  authority  to  assume  command  of  an  organization  passes  by  operation  of  law  to  the senior military officer (by grade and, within the same grade, by rank within that grade) assigned to  an  organization  who  is  present  for  duty  and  eligible  to  command  that  organization.    For specific  rules  on  appointment  to,  and  assumption  of  command  in  the  Regular  Air  Force,  Air Force  Reserve,  and  Air  National  Guard  when  in  federal  service,  refer  to  AFI  51-604, Appointment to and Assumption of Command.

Complaint—A formal assertion concerning a wrong; or violation of law, regulation, instruction, policy,  procedure  or  rule;  or  report  of  conditions  detrimental  to  the  operation,  mission,  or reputation of the AF. Complaint  Analysis—A  complaint  analysis  is  the  process  for  determining  the  most  effective resolution strategy to resolve the issues raised by the complainant’s assertion.  It is a preliminary review  of  assertions  and  evidence  to  determine  the  potential  validity  and  relevance  of  the assertion to the AF and to determine what action, if any, in IG, supervisory, or other channels is necessary.    .    The  complaint  analysis  decision  document  is  used  to  record  the  rationale  for  the selected complaint resolution strategy.  Complaint  Clarification—The process of interviewing the complainant to ensure the intent of the complaint is verified. Complaint  Resolution Process—The Complaint Resolution Process describes actions required to  resolve  a  complaint  from  receipt  through  closure.

The IG has a responsibility to safeguard the personal identity of individuals seeking assistance or participating in  an IG process such as an  investigation  and  to  honor  the  legal  agreements  between  parties  concerning  confidentiality provisions in settlement agreements.  While this does not mean communications made to an IG are privileged or confidential, it does mean disclosure of those communications (and the identity of the communicant) is strictly limited to an official, need-to-know basis.  This information is not disclosed unless required by law or regulation, when necessary to take adverse action against a subject, or with the approval of The Inspector General (SAF/IG), or approval of the Appointing Authority.

Substantial  and  Specific  Danger  to  Public  Health  or  Safety—Two  of  the  factors  that determine when a disclosed danger is sufficiently substantial and specific are (1) the likelihood of  harm  resulting  from  the  danger  and  (2)  when  the  alleged  harm  may  occur.  If  the  disclosed danger could only result in harm under speculative or improbable conditions, it is less likely to be found specific.   If the harm is  likely to  occur in  the immediate or near future as opposed to manifesting only in the distant future it is more likely qualify as a specific danger.  Both of these factors  affect  the  specificity  of  the  alleged  danger,  while  the  nature  of  the  harm—the  potential consequences—affects the substantiality of the danger. Substantiated—A substantiated finding results when a preponderance of the evidence supports the complainant’s allegation of a wrong or violation of law, regulation, procedure, or AF policy or  standards.  The  facts  (from  documentation  and  testimony)  indicate  the  complainant  was wronged or a violation of standards occurred. Summarized  Testimony—A  written  summary  of  witness  testimony  prepared  and  certified  by the IO.  It normally includes only those items directly related to the matters under examination.

Suspect—An individual suspected of a criminal offense.  Identify a person as a suspect when the facts and circumstances known at the time of the interview are sufficient to support a reasonable belief  that  the  person  to  be  interviewed  may  have  committed  a  crime.

Thoroughness—All inspector general operations must be conducted in a diligent and thorough manner, addressing relevant aspects of the readiness, economy, efficiency, and state of discipline of  the  institution.    IG  operations  must  clearly  and  concisely  reflect  all  elements  of  the  issues under examination.  Reasonable steps should be taken to ensure pertinent issues are sufficiently resolved  and  that  all  appropriate  root  causes  and  remedies  are  considered.    The  results  of  166 AFI90-301  27 AUGUST 2015 inspector  general  operations  must  not  raise  unanswered  questions,  nor  leave  matters  open  to question or misinterpretation. Timeliness—Inspector general operations must be conducted and reported with due diligence in a  timely  manner.    The  objective  is  to  be  responsive  to  all  parties  thereby  enhancing  AF credibility.  IG operations are to be conducted and completed within a timeframe that facilitates efficient and effective mission accomplishment while protecting the public’s safety and security. IGs are responsible to ensure that the investigation, inspection or evaluation is completed at the appropriate time.

For  example, legitimate  stockpiles  and  reserves  for  wartime  needs,  which  may  appear  redundant  and  costly, are not considered waste. Whistleblowing—A  protected  communication  disclosing  information  by  an  employee  or applicant  that  he  or  she  reasonably  believes  evidences  a  violation  of  a  law,  rule,  or  regulation; gross mismanagement; gross waste of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.
