Work with functional experts from the pilot unit and AFCEC, along with engineers/equipment specialists at the support source of supply, to determine replacement stock numbers for obsolete and terminal items. In addition, the WRM GMO will update CRUMS and enterprise kit details with the replacement stock number.  (Added) 2.4.5.10.  WRM RSP kit serial numbers (KSN) are listed in the Non-Airborne War and Mobilization Plan (WMP), which constitutes the WRM RSP authorization document. At a minimum, the WMP will contain KSNs and quantities by storage location. The Non-Airborne WMP is retained by the 635th SCOW.  (Added) 2.4.5.11.  MAJCOM WRMOs will coordinate with AFMC as changes to UTC authorizations occur. The RSP Authorization Document, Volume II, Non-Airborne WMP reflects an accurate picture of WRM KSNs at all times. WRM KSNs listed in the WMP match the WRM KSNs loaded in ES-S and CRUMS.  (Added) 2.4.5.12.  The WRM RSP KSN structure will be standardized across commands to allow the use of centralized reconciliation tools and reduce excess WRM KSN records. Any deviations from the below WRM KSN structures must be fully justified in writing and approved 6                                                   AFMAN 23-122_AFGM 2017-01  by the WRM GMO. WRM RSP KSNs will be structured as follows: SRANs (storing locations) will load a unique WRM KSN per UTC, with individual kits delineated by organization/shop codes. The same WRM KSN cannot be loaded at multiple SRANs within a host and satellite supply account grouping. (Ex: When a PACAF SRAN supports four XFABL UTCs, load KSN ABOBBL0R0100 with Org/Shops of 809AA, 809AB, 809AC, and 809AD (the WRM KSN at the second SRAN would be ABOBBL0R01(x)(x)). Shops AA, AB, AC, and AD represent individual kits containing standard contents based on CRUMS.)   (Added) 2.4.5.13.  WRM RSP reconciliations are centrally processed annually by the WRM GMO using CRUMS data (source system) compared to ES-S special spares details (233 detail) linked to the master WRM KSN record (024 record) and Org/Shop control record (025 record).  (Added) 2.4.5.13.1. S07/S05 program logic is used for WRM RSP reconciliations. XTJ/XVF files will not be produced depending on which reconciliation option is utilized.     (Added) 2.4.5.13.2. When the ES-S automated reconciliation option is used the WRM GMO will extract and organize data pulled from CRUMS to create XTJ/XVF files for upload into ES-S.  (Added) 2.4.5.13.3. When the WRM GMO defers using the centralized ES-S option no XTJ/XVF will be produced, but the same logic will be used to compare CRUMS and ES-S records.  (Added) 2.4.5.13.4. A pseudo “clean” S05 will be signed by the WRM GMO and posted on the WRM SharePoint. The ES-S reconciliation (S05) date will also be updated.   (Added) 2.4.5.14. MAJCOM WRMOs options for handling reconciliation excess:  (Added) 2.4.5.14.1. Option 1. The WRM GMO will notify the MAJCOM WRMO of RSP details requiring return action by the storing location. Once returns are processed the WRM GMO will delete or adjust the details to reflect the correct authorization.  (Added) 2.4.5.14.2. Option 2. The WRM GMO will load KSN details for each stock number where excesses are generated as a result of authorization changes. The details will be loaded with an authorized quantity equal to the excess quantity, an unsupportable detail flag of “F”, an unsupportable quantity equal to the excess quantity and an allowance source code (ASC) of 080EXCE. The WRM GMO, or storage location at the request of the MAJCOM WRMO, will process 1KT transactions to move the excess from the authorized detail to the excess detail. The original detail will be adjusted accordingly to reflect the proper authorization quantity.  (Added) 2.4.5.14.2.1.  WRM RSP details containing a 080EXCE ASC will not be considered as part of the reconciliation. 7                                                   AFMAN 23-122_AFGM 2017-01   (Added) 2.4.5.14.2.2.  The WRM GMO will provide a 080EXCE report to the MAJCOM WRMOs monthly.  (Added) 2.4.5.14.2.3.  When directed by the WRM GMO 080EXCE excesses will be turned in to stock to satisfy enterprise WRM shortages. MAJCOM WRMOs will engage with WRM storage locations to get excesses turned in to stock, making assets available for redistribution.  (Added) 2.4.5.14.2.4.  WRM storage locations will return assets maintained on special spares details containing ASC 080EXCE to stock and delete the detail.   (Added) 2.4.5.15.  Direct vendor delivery of WRM RSP initial spares procured with APPN 3080 funds must be accounted for on special spares details.  (Added) 2.4.5.15.1.  The WRM GMO will provide the MAJCOM WRMO with the delivery schedule and WRM RSP components list.  (Added) 2.4.5.15.1.2.  When the list contains non-stock listed items the WRM GMO will assign a temporary local serialized stock number and add the items to CRUMS.  (Added) 2.4.5.15.1.3.  The MAJCOM WRMO will notify the WRM GMO of delivery of assets.  Storage locations have 72 hours from receipt to conduct inventory of assets received.  MAJCOM WRMOs will provide the following: Type and quantity of kits received, copy of the DD Form 250 with packing list, list of overages, shortages and items not identified on the packing list, org and shop code for each authorized kit.

Purpose, Scope and Description of Manual. 1.1.1.  Purpose  and  Scope.  The  purpose  of  this  manual  is  to  further  implement  direction provided  in  AFPD  23-1  and  AFI  23-101.  This  guidance  provides  directions  for  performing predominantly  retail  materiel  management  processes  associated  with  determining  stock requirements,  inventorying,  storing  materiel,  cataloging,  ordering,  sourcing,  receiving, delivering,  and  return/disposal  of  materiel  for  Class  IX  repair  parts  and  select  Class  VII major  end  items  as  identified  and  approved  by  Headquarters  AF  (HAF).  Additionally, guidance  for  other  classes  of  supply  is  covered  in  specific  subject  areas.  These  references will be specifically enumerated where applicable. 1.1.2.  Supplementation  and  Waiver  Authority.  This  instruction  may  be  supplemented  no lower  than  the  Major  Command  (MAJCOM)  level  unless  otherwise  indicated.  MAJCOMs supplementing  this  instruction  must  coordinate  with  AF/A4LR  and  will  follow  guidance  in AFI  33-360,  Publications  and  Forms  Management.  All  waiver  requests  to  this  instruction must be approved by the certifying official of this instruction. 1.1.3.  Description.  This  manual  has  the  same  construct  as  AFI  23-101  and  AFH  23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1. While not all sections within AFI 23-101 have associated procedures enumerated in AFMAN 23-122, those sections where procedures are detailed have the same section titles.  In a similar manner, where applicable, sections have the same titles in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1. For example, Sec. 5D, is the same section in AFI 23-101, AFMAN 23-122, and AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 1.1.3.1.  Users are encouraged to refer to Attachment 1 for reference information as well as identification of legacy AF supply chain functions with updated terminology. 1.1.3.2.  The Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S) system is the overarching term used to describe the system(s) used by base retail materiel management operations. The ILS-S  is  comprised  of  the  Standard  Base  Supply  System  (SBSS),  Enterprise  Solution  – Supply  (ES-S),  and  the  Air  Force  Supply  Centralized  Database  (AFSCDB).  In  many cases  the  term  ILS-S  is  used  to  identify  system  related  functions/references.  Where applicable,  in  some  instances,  specific  identification  of  SBSS  or  ES-S  is  used  for  more detailed identification. Section 1B—Organizational Structures & Responsibilities 1.2.  Organizational Structures & Responsibilities. 1.2.1.  Change of Accountable Officers (AOs). 1.2.1.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  Change  of  AOs  process.  For  policy  specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 8 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 1.2.1.2.  When the AO of an accountable Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC)  is  replaced  by  a  newly  designated  AO  the  following  actions  will  be performed: 1.2.1.2.1.  Complete a 100% inventory of NWRM for FB accounts with NWRM IAW Sec. 5G, prior to transfer of accountability. (T-1). 1.2.1.2.2.  The  installation/  wing  commander  or  equivalent  with  approving  official input  will  determine  if  conditions  exist  which  would  preclude  relief  from accountability  or  require  board/survey  action  against  the  officer  before  the  present AO  is  relieved  from  accountability.  (T-1).  If  applicable,  refer  to  AFMAN  23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property. 1.2.1.2.3.  Process  the  consolidated  inventory  adjustment  document  register  as  the record  of  activity  for  FB  account  transfers.  (T-1).  See  Consolidated  Inventory Adjustment  Document  Register  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  5.  Note:  Material Management  IT  system  queries  will  not  be  used  as  the  official  tool  to  perform  this function. 1.2.1.2.3.1.  The Materiel Management Flight will initiate a certificate of transfer for  the  account.  (T-1).  See  Figure  1.1  for  FB  accounts  and  Figure  1.2  for transfers of FB account with NWRM. 1.2.1.3.  For  other  than  "FB"  account  transfers  refer  to  Figure  1.3.  If  other  guidance outlines  transfer  of  accountability  actions,  it  may  be  used  in  lieu  of  Figure  1.3  (e.g., "FK"  of  “FV”  munitions  account  transfers  will  refer  to  AFI  21-201,  Munitions Management for appropriate guidance.) Note: Contractor managed accounts must have a government AO appointed. The government AO can either be the functional area chief, quality assurance evaluator, or other appointed government individual who is qualified in the appropriate AFSC. These procedures apply to the transition of these AOs as well.   AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 9 Figure 1.1.

(T-1). Section 1C—Satellite Operations 1.3.  Satellite Operations. 1.3.1.  Satellite Relocation (Re-home). 1.3.1.1.  Purpose: Satellite accounts are moved from one computer support base (CSB) to another for satellite support for a variety of reasons: to improve support, to accommodate additional satellite accounts at the host base, to relieve a host base of too many accounts, to  arrange  new  support  when  a  base  closes,  etc.  The  process  has  to  be  exact.  Strict management  control  and  cooperation  from  all  activities  involved  are  necessary.  In  this section,  timeline  requirements,  monitoring  responsibilities,  and  reporting  requirements are  covered.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 1.3.1.2.  General  Procedure:  For  a  satellite  account  to  be  relocated,  certain  specific procedures  are  required.  The  transfer  procedures  discussed  here  allow  for  an  orderly transfer, and they apply to all activities involved in relocation. These procedures must be accomplished  in  the  order  presented,  and  MAJCOMS  must  supplement  with  directives needed for special requirements. 1.3.1.2.1.  Time  Requirement.  Plan  to  start  relocation  actions  90  days  before  the relocation schedule date, unless the major command in coordination with the AFMC elects to complete the procedure in a shorter period. 1.3.1.2.2.  The  LRS  CC/AO,  AFMC  and  Accounting  &  Finance  officers  at  both  the gaining and losing bases will appoint representatives to monitor the transfer process. (T-2). 1.3.1.2.3.  Transfer.  After  down-loading  procedures  are  completed,  AFMC  and  LRS CC/AO  have  the  responsibility  of  transferring  all  output  to  the  gaining  CSB responsible for uploading the records. 1.3.1.2.4.  Points of Contact. Good communication is the key to a successful rehome. Primary  and alternate points of contact  at  both  the  gaining and the losing bases and AFMC must be identified. Each individual selected as a point of contact must have a good  working  knowledge  of  the  rehome  process.  Recommend  that  the  points  of contact  be  selected  from  Functional  Systems  Management  Section  (LGLOS)  or equivalent. 12 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 1.3.1.2.5.  Reporting  Requirements.  Notify  the  Standard  Systems  Group  control room,  HQ  AFMC,  prior  to  the  rehome  download  and  when  the  rehome  has  been completed. The gaining CSB or AFMC reports the beginning of upload and notifies AFMC  when  upload  is  completed.  Any  problems  with  hardware,  procedures,  or software  will  be  reported  by  means  of  normal  procedures.  When  difficulties  are encountered  in  efforts  to  resume  normal  operations,  satellite  parent  command,  CSB gaining command, and AFMC. 1.3.2.  Satellite Relocation (Re-home) Sequence for Pre-Relocation Actions. 1.3.2.1.  Purpose:  To  provide  a  recommended  schedule  for  planning  satellite  relocation (re-home) beginning 90 days before the completion date.

Establishing a Satellite Account. 1.3.3.1.  Purpose: This section describes the procedures used to establish (also known as conversion) a satellite account. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 1.3.3.2.  Pre-conversion/Conversion Requirements. 1.3.3.2.1.  Formal  Agreements.  When  a  satellite  account  is  established,  a  formal agreement about responsibilities may be considered between the account and the host base. This agreement may be in the form of a support agreement written according to the regulations contained in AFPD 25-2, Support Agreements, a contract, or a formal MOA. 1.3.3.2.2.  Time Requirements. Pre-conversion actions are normally time phased from a period of 120 days prior to conversion. The 120-day lead time may be compressed or  expanded  as  mission  dictates.  All  functions  scheduled  to  establish  a  satellite account use the basic procedures contained in this section. 1.3.3.2.3.  Reporting  Requirements:  The  new  host  CSB  or  AFMC  will  notify  when the  upload  begins  and  when  the  upload  is  complete.  Normal  procedures  are  used  to report to  the major  command and AFMC any  problems with  hardware, software, or procedures. 1.3.3.2.4.  GSD  SMAG  Operating  Program.  The  gaining  major  command  is responsible for notifying HQ AFMC/FMRS of an anticipated move or conversion, the date of the move or conversion will take place, and any pertinent information on the major command involved. 1.3.3.2.5.  Notification of Conversion. The gaining major command is responsible for notifying certain agencies when a host or satellite account is established. The gaining major command will: 1.3.3.2.5.1.  Submit  a  letter/message  to  the  AFMC  Allowance  Manager  advising them of the pending conversion and requesting any known address changes. Note: Notify AFMC Allowance Standard Activity only if the account is type E. 1.3.3.2.5.2.  Send  a  message  to  DLA  Transaction  Services(DLATS),  Wright-Patterson  AFB,  Ohio,  advising  them  of  any  SRAN  changes  and  the  type  of accounts affected (for example, FB, FG, FP, etc.). 1.3.3.3.  Satellite Account Pre-Conversion/Conversion. 1.3.3.3.1.  Refer to Satellite Rehome Sequence for Pre-Relocation System Processing in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 1 for the programs/processes needed to support Pre-Conversion and Conversion. 14 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Chapter 2 PLAN Section 2A—Overview 2.1.  Overview.  This  chapter  outlines  steps  for  the  materiel  management  processes  associated with  demand  and  supply  planning  for  base  retail  operations.  These  activities  include  Stockage Policy procedures;  Financial Management; WRM;  Degraded Operations; and Readiness Spares Packages and Kits; Contingency/ Wartime Planning. Section 2B—Stockage Procedure 2.2.  Stockage Procedure. 2.2.1.  Readiness Based Leveling. 2.2.1.1.  Purpose:  Describe  the  procedures  and  transactions  used  to  implement  and maintain  centrally  computed  Readiness  Based  Levels.  For  policy  specific  requirements refer to AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123. 2.2.1.2.  General Readiness Based Level (RBL) procedures. A Readiness Based Level is a  centrally  computed  quantity  pushed  from  the  Air  Force  RBL  (D035E)  system.  When RBL levels are established in the ILS-S, the RBL quantity becomes the peacetime portion of the total base requirement and the base stock level. 2.2.1.3.  RBL levels are identified in the ILS-S with Type Level Flag F and “A007PL” in the first six positions of the document number. See Guide To Assigning The Type Level Flag  (TLF)  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  2  for  a  list  of  type  level  flags.  The  RBL process  was  designed the  AFMC-computed  worldwide  peacetime requirements  among  AF  bases  and  depots  in  a  way  that  minimizes  worldwide  expected backorders. to  allocate 2.2.1.4.  Contractor  Inventory  Control  Points  (C-ICP)  are  responsible  for  total  item management including the requirements computation and setting and updating base stock levels. Wholesale Contractor ICPs may use RBL, their own unique leveling system, or a combination of both in managing item stock levels. 2.2.1.5.  Computing  RBLs  considers  item  usage  (demand  data),  pipeline  times,  adjusted stock  levels  and  worldwide  requirements  data.    Bases  send  item  usage  data  to  the  RBL (D035E)  or  Contractor  Inventory  Control  Point  (C-ICP)  central  leveling  system  via electronic transactions (e.g., XCB). AFMC/C-ICPs can request  updated  base usage data via  electronic  requests  (XCE)  when  base  daily  demand/percent  base  repair  reports  are over  90  days  old.  The  RBL  process  uses  base  specific  data  to  determine  the  optimum allocation of the worldwide requirement. The following actions will be performed: 2.2.1.5.1.  RBL is processed quarterly at AFMC for both the base and the depot. The computation  is  performed  during  the  third  week  of  the  first  month  of  each  quarter. Generally,  the  system  will  allocate  a  stock  level  to  all  worldwide  users.  However, there is no guarantee that each user will receive a positive level, because even though a  base  may  have  sufficient  demands  to  establish  a  demand  level  in  the  ILS-S,  the AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 15 AFMC-computed worldwide peacetime requirement may not be sufficient to allocate a  positive  level  to  every  base.  Therefore,  the  system  could  allocate  a  stock  level  of zero to  a base. An  exception applies to  selected  Communications-Electronics (C-E), Nuclear  Command,  Control,  Communication  (NC3)  systems,  space,  and  ground based launched missile system items that are managed under the Low Density Level (LDL)  process.  For  LDLs,  AFMC  LDL  manager  consolidates  MAJCOM-approved levels, creates a flat file and sends it to AFMC to be loaded into the RBL system each quarter. 2.2.1.5.1.1.  AFMC  will  review  and  approve  any  exclusion  to  these  LDL  RBL rules.  A MAJCOM may request exclusions to the LDL RBL rules by submitting a  list  of  the  applicable  NSNs,  SRD  and/or  SRANs  which  they  want  to  exclude, with supporting justification, to AFMC. (T-1). AFMC will review the request for exclusion  and  approve  or  disapprove  the  request.  (T-1).  When  disapproved, AFMC  will  coordinate  with  HAF  and  the  requesting  MAJCOM.  (T-1).  When approved  the  request,  the  excluded  items  will  be  passed  to  AFSC/LGP  so  the exclusions can be included in the next RBL quarterly push. When the exclusion is approved  between  the  normal  quarterly  push,  but  requires  immediate  processing to  meet  mission  needs,  an  out-of-cycle  re-computation  of  levels  can  be accomplished for the affected NSNs, SRD and/or SRANs. 2.2.1.5.2.  The  RBL  system  contains  special  rules  for  honoring  Contingency  High Priority  Mission  Support  Kit  (CHPMSK)  requirements.  When  approved  by AFMC/A4,  CHPMSK  levels  are  loaded  at  contingency  (deployment)  locations  and supported  by  the  source  of  supply.  For  tactical  JCS  coded  units,  AFMC/A4  may authorize  CHPMSKs  for  those  units  supported  by  IRSP  offset  levels.  CHPMSKs support long term (over 90 days) contingency needs. To accommodate the CHPMSK requirements,  RBL  subtracts  the  CHPMSK  authorized  quantity  from  the  worldwide peacetime  requirements  before  any  RBL  allocations  are  made.  Therefore,  the additional  CHPMSK  quantity  that  will  be  requisitioned  by  the  contingency  location will  be  offset  by  reductions  in  RBL  allocations  to  all  worldwide  users  of  the CHPMSK items. Note: AFMC/A4 will maintain/publish a listing of units authorized CHPMSK. This listing will be updated at least annually in preparation for the annual CHPMSK review. 2.2.1.5.3.  AFMC  and  C-ICPs  communicate  centrally  computed  RBLs  sent  via centrally computed level transactions. See Readiness Based Level (RBL) Procedures and  Transactions  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  2  for  specific  details  and  input format  for  centrally  computed  level  transactions.  The  RBL  will  always  be  sent  to bases on the AFMC master NSN for items in an interchangeable and substitute group (I&SG) or on a bachelor NSN for items that are not in an I&SG. 2.2.2.  Customer Oriented Leveling Technique (COLT). 2.2.2.1.  Purpose:  Describe  the  procedures  used  to  implement  and  maintain  COLT.  For policy  specific  requirements  refer  to  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  refer  to COLT Procedures in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. 2.2.2.2.  General  Customer  Oriented  Leveling  Technique  (COLT)  centrally  computes levels  for  Budget  Code  9  items  that  have  an  established  demand  pattern  at  a  base.  The 16 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 following  paragraphs  describe  the  methodology  for  setting  and  implementing  COLT stock levels. 2.2.2.3.  The  COLT  process  was  designed  to  set  base  stock  levels  on  DLA-managed items in a way that minimizes base-wide unit customer wait time (CWT) per dollar spent. CWT considers both  the number of items  issued immediately and backordered (as does issue  effectiveness)  as  well  as  the  duration  of  the  backorders  to  provide  a  complete measure of the efficiency and effectiveness of the levels. COLT is generally designed to produce base stock levels that are cost-neutral with respect to the ILS-S demand leveling process. The COLT process described in COLT Procedures in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch  2  was  initially  developed  and  tested  in  2003,  and  approved  for  Air  Force  wide implementation in 2005. 2.2.2.4.  The Air Force COLT team obtains base-level data from the Air Force centralized database for input to the COLT model. The COLT model develops stock levels one base at  a  time;  finding  the  optimum  levels.  A  review  of  the  output  is  performed  by  the  AF COLT  team.  Time  is  provided  in  the  process  for  AFMC,  MAJCOMs,  or  bases  to optionally  review  the  output  to  ensure  level  accuracy.  AFMC,  MAJCOM/base  may decide  to  exclude  some  items  from  receiving  levels  based  on  local  conditions  (e.g., improper coding of HAZMAT items). The final COLT levels are then sent to the ILS-S using  XCA  transactions.  They  are  implemented  in  the  ILS-S  via  RBL  transactions described  in  RBL  Procedures  and  Transactions,  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  2.  No special level request documentation approval/submission is required for COLT items. 2.2.2.5.  COLT  levels  are  computed  once  a  quarter  for  each  base.  To  spread  the workload, COLT computes levels for one-third of the bases each month of the quarter. 2.2.2.5.1.  Quarterly-computed COLT levels  are only pushed to  bases when the new level  differs  from  the  existing  base  stock  level  by  more  than  the  square  root  of  the existing level. Note: Increases in levels for items with Mission Impact Code (MIC) 1 will  always  be  pushed  regardless  of  the  difference  from  previous  levels.  This  is  the same  as  the  ILS-S  rule  and  is  designed  to  reduce  level  volatility.  See  COLT Procedures in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for additional explanation. 2.2.2.6.  There are a number of constraints (level caps) in COLT to control the depth of leveling. Like the ILS-S computed demand levels, the economic order quantity (EOQ) is capped  at  one  year's  demand  quantity  as  is  the  COLT  reorder  point  (ROP).  These  caps are designed to prevent over stocking. 2.2.2.6.1.  COLT stops leveling when the Expected Backorders (EBOs) are less than 0.0027; preventing leveling where there are minimal gains. COLT supports the use of the Shelf Life Code (SLC); capping levels at half the shelf life quantity. 2.2.2.6.2.  Stockage  Priority  Code  (SPC)  5  items  are  capped  at  the  existing  on  hand balance.  This  allows  COLT  to  maintain  a  level  on  these  items  (and  prevent backorders),  while  keeping  the  system  from  buying  more  stock  until  there  are subsequent  demands.  When  there  are  subsequent  demands,  the  SPC  code  will  be upgraded, allowing the resumption of full COLT leveling. The final cap calls for the total COLT level to be capped at $4K (if the ILS-S demand level = 0) or $5K more AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 17 than the ILS-S demand level (if the demand level > 0). COLT will sometimes provide significantly more depth of levels than the current ILS-S demand level. 2.2.2.6.3.  COLT has several rules that restrict the levels. There is an initial leveling rule  in  COLT  to  prevent  initially  stocking  an  item  when  the  chance  of  a  future demand  is  small.  COLT  logic  limits  stock  levels  for  Individual  Equipment  (IEU) items  (Federal  Stock Group 84 and Federal  Stock Class 4240) and HAZMAT items (IEX  9).  To  accommodate  MAJCOM  policies,  COLT  only  provides  levels  on  these items if ILS-S demand level > 0. COLT will not stock any item with a Max Level of 0  or  an  SPC  of  E.  In  addition,  there  are  exclusion/zero  lists  maintained  by  the  AF COLT team, modified by the MAJCOMs/ AFMC, which excludes items in identified federal stock classes at identified bases from receiving positive levels. 2.2.2.6.4.  The ILS-S programmatically assigns mission impact code (MIC) 1 to items that  have  previously  caused  a  MICAP  at  that  base.  All  COLT  candidate  items  will receive a positive level  on MIC 1 items, except  for those MIC items with an SPC 5 and no on-hand serviceable balance. 2.2.2.6.5.  COLT  has  other  rules  to  modify  levels.  COLT  uses  the  Mission  Change details and Base Closure Flags to modify demand and leveling for changing missions. COLT  has  a  bench  stock/RSP  rule  where  it  considers  other  inventory  on  a  base  as partially  available  to  help  avoid  backorders.  Finally,  COLT  has  special  logic  to determine levels for the AMC Forward Supply Locations. 2.2.2.7.  Refer to COLT Procedures in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for further details associated with COLT transaction processing. 2.2.3.  Proactive Demand Levels (PDL). 2.2.3.1.  Purpose:  Describes  the  procedures  used  to  generate  and  communicate  PDL  to base  level.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.2.3.2.  PDL  is  used  to  compute  levels  for  items  that  have  no  demand  history  or extremely low historical demands. The goal of PDL is to reduce the number of MICAPs for Material Management IT systems non-stocked items. 2.2.3.3.  PDL  Procedures  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  2  describes  the  methodology for setting and implementing PDL. 2.2.4.  Mission Change Data. 2.2.4.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  Mission  Change  Data  (MCD)  procedures  process.  For policy  specific  requirements  refer  to  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  refer  to AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. 2.2.4.2.  The  mission-change  process  is  designed  to  alter  base  stock  levels  for  items applicable to a weapon system that is already assigned at the base that will be affected by a known “mission change.” 2.2.4.3.  A  mission  change  is  the  addition  or  loss  of  a  number  of  weapon  system  end items at a base or the base may be tasked to fly the same number of sorties, but increase or decrease the average sortie duration. The ILS-S can use the base historical SRD-based 18 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 consumption  data  for  the  applicable  weapon  system  and  information  about  the  mission change to adjust base demand, thereby adjusting the stock levels for the weapon system applicable  items.  Consider  an  example  in  which  the  mission  change  process  should  be used. Suppose a base has 24 F-16C aircraft assigned and is going to receive an additional 12  aircraft  in  6  months.  The  actions  contained  in  Mission  Change  and  New  Activation Spares Support List Procedures, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 will be taken by the base to establish sufficient materiel management support for the increased number of aircraft. 2.2.4.4.  Reference Mission Change and New Activation Spares Support List Procedures, AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  2  for  further  details  associated  with  MCD  transaction processing. 2.2.5.  Adjusted Stock Level Requests. 2.2.5.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  general  procedures  for  requesting  and  processing Adjusted Stock Level (ASL) Requests. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use refer to AFH 23-123. 2.2.5.2.  General.  Activities  may  submit  requests  for  ASLs  to  AFMC  using  a  digitally signed  email.  Where  multiple  individual  items  with  same  justification  require  ASLs, request may be submitted in a single correspondence. All required data must be included on  the  request,  message  or  email.  Repetitious  data  need  only  be  provided  once.  All approved ASL’s will be validated through the appropriate approval authority biennially. 2.2.5.2.1.  Categories. 2.2.5.2.1.1.

Provide  detailed  justification  for  all  initial  requests  for negotiated  levels  to  AFMC.  Clearly  justify  the  reason  for  the  request  and  the  expected period of need. The quantity requested should be the minimum essential quantity required to support the requirement. 2.2.5.3.1.  All ASL request will contain the following information: 2.2.5.3.1.1.  Level Justification Code. 2.2.5.3.1.2.  For  Low  Density  Levels  (LDL),  the  following  additional  data  is required: 2.2.5.3.1.3.  Lead Command of the supported Weapons System. 2.2.5.3.1.4.  Type of LDL level being requested: 2.2.5.3.1.4.1.  Single Point Failure (SPF) Items. Single point failure items are items whose failure will render a system inoperative and/or unable to perform its designated mission. SPF items are pre-positioned to meet specific mission requirements such as system restoration time of 48 hours or less and warrants pre-positioning  of  a  spare  or  storage  at  a  designated  centralized  storage location. 2.2.5.3.1.4.2.  Operational Readiness Part (ORP) Items. Operational readiness part (ORP) items do not fit the general definition of an SPF item. Range and depth of available weapon system inventory usually warrants pre-positioning of the spare or storage at a supply point or centralized storage location. These conditions  require  pre-positioning  of  ORP  items.  Examples  of  ORP,  a  units’ unique (remote) location, a small worldwide available inventory, or units with multiple  system  locations.  ORP  items  are  required  to  maintain  maximum redundant capabilities or a one-of-a-kind system capability. 2.2.5.3.1.4.3.  Joint Transfer Agreement (JTA) Items. Joint transfer agreement (JTA)  items  are  inter-Service  C-E  related  and  have  been  authorized  for  pre-positioning by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). These assets are required to be maintained on a supply point for the life of the system. 2.2.5.3.1.4.4.  Non-Prepositioned  (NPP).  This  encompasses  the  remaining LDL levels that do not mandate pre-positioning. 2.2.5.3.2.  Send  ASL  requests  to  the  appropriate  AFMC  for  an  analysis/review.  For Non-Weapon  System  related  requests,  AFMC  will  perform  analysis/review.  AFMC will  assess  the  need  for  the  level  and  best  placement  throughout  the  enterprise  to support the identified need. If other than AFMC initiated, ASL requests that are not justified  will  be  disapproved  and/or  returned  without  action  to  the  initiator,  with reason  for  disapproval.  Disapproved  requests  will  be  returned  through  the  same channels that submitted the request. 2.2.5.3.2.1.  The  analysis/review  responsibility  includes  the  identification  of plausible alternatives to the establishment of the ASLs. For example, recommend disapproval  of  the  ASL  request  if  the  item  can  be  obtained  from  a  depot, purchased, or manufactured locally in time to satisfy operational requirements. 20 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 2.2.5.4.  Types of Approved Levels. ASLs will be categorized as Directed, Permanent or Temporary based on the reason and results of the analysis/review. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for further guidance. 2.2.5.4.1.  Load  approved  ASLs  with  the  appropriate  Reason  Why  Code  (RWC) outlined  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  2.  If  there  is  not  a  specific  RWC  for  the situation,  load  the  ASL  with  RWC  “Y”  and  file  all  correspondence  related  to  the approval of the level for future reference. 2.2.5.4.2.  Permanent Levels. 2.2.5.4.2.1.  When  analysis/review  determines  the  need  for  an  ASL  based  on  an indefinite period or critical mission requirement and the demands pattern will not warrant  an  RBL/COLT  level,  a  permanent  level  will  be  approved  using Sustainment Flag P. 2.2.5.4.2.2.  Permanent Levels can be loaded as a Minimum, Maximum, or Fixed type level, as Type level flag C, D, and E. 2.2.5.4.2.3.  Permanent  Levels  will  be  reviewed  upon  changes  in  mission  or activation/deactivation of major weapons systems. 2.2.5.4.2.3.1.  When  review  shows  the  level  is  no  longer  required  or  a  lesser quantity is justified, AFMC will process an Adjusted Stock Level Delete input to  delete  the  level  or  Adjusted  Stock  Level  Change  input  to  adjust  the authorized quantity. 2.2.5.4.2.3.2.  Use  the  Special  Level  Review  Listing  or  comparable  ILS-S Query to manage and or delete any Permanent Levels that need deletion. 2.2.5.4.3.  Temporary Levels. 2.2.5.4.3.1.  When  a  change  in  mission  or  new  mission  requirements  justify  the need for an  ASL and the purpose  for the level  indicates that future demand will result  in  a  self-sustaining  level,  AFMC  will  establish  the  level  as  a  temporary level using Sustainment Flag T. 2.2.5.4.3.2.  Using Sustainment Flag T, process an Adjusted Stock Level Load or Adjusted  Stock  Level  Approval  Date  Update  input  with  a  determined  expiration date.  The  approval  date  will  be  computed  by  subtracting  730  days  from  the expiration  date.  This  date  will  be  entered  on  the  Adjusted  Stock  Level  Load  or Adjusted Stock Level Approval Date Update transaction. 2.2.5.4.3.3.  Temporary Levels can be loaded as a Minimum, Maximum, or Fixed type  level,  as  Type  Level  Flag  A,  B,  D  or  E.  In  most  cases,  Temporary  Levels should be loaded as Minimum to allow the ASL to be deleted or  become Memo once the normal demand computation meets or exceeds the ASL. 2.2.5.4.3.4.  Use the Special Level Review Listing or comparable ILS-S Query to manage and or delete any Temporary Levels. 2.2.5.4.4.  Directed Levels 2.2.5.4.4.1.  Adjusted  Stock  Levels  directed  from  higher  levels  are  termed AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 21 directed because the quantity, application, justification, and approval have already been determined. 2.2.5.4.4.2.  Directed  Levels  can  be  loaded  with  Sustainment  Flag  P  or  T  as determined by the directing activity. 2.2.5.4.4.3.  All  directed  ASLs are established in  the  ILS-S as  either a minimum memo ASL, maximum, or fixed firm ASL upon receipt. Any Type Level Flag can be used per the directing activity of the level  request.  See Adjusted Stock  Level Load,  Change,  Delete  Transaction  (1F3)  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  2  for more information and processing directed levels loads, changes and deletes. 2.2.5.4.4.4.  Directed  Levels  are  reviewed  upon  changes activation/deactivation of major weapons systems. in  mission  or 2.2.5.4.4.5.  When  review  shows  the  level  is  no  longer  required  or  a  lesser quantity justified,  AFMC  will  coordinate  with  directing  activity  on deletion/change of the ASL. is 2.2.5.5.  The following actions will be performed when ASLs are disapproved: 2.2.5.5.1.  AFMC  personnel  will  prepare  an  Adjusted  Stock  Level  Delete  input  as prescribed in Adjusted Stock Level (ASL) Delete Input Format (1F3D), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 to delete the ASL detail record. 2.2.5.6.  ASL requests for AFMC-managed non-airborne Communications-Electronic (C-E), Nuclear Command, Control, Communication (NC3) systems. Space, Weather, Radar, and Missile Systems are submitted electronically (439SCOS.GWM.LDL@us.af.mil) by the  requestor  to  the  MAJCOM/Lead  MAJCOM.    MAJCOM/Lead  MAJCOM  will forward to appropriate AFMC/SCOS for processing. 2.2.5.7.  ASL  Load  to  Interchangeable  and  Substitute  Group  (I&SG).  AFMC  personnel may load Minimum, Maximum, or Fixed ASL detail records to any item within an ISG. Moreover, AFMC personnel may load multiple detail records to the same item or group when: (1) the ASL is required to support different end items; (2) support is required by different shops within the same organization; or (3) support is required by different base organizations. 2.2.5.8.  Guidelines for approving ASL requests are as follows: 2.2.5.8.1.  AFMC  loads  a  memo  detail  level  and  retains  a  suspense  copy  pending approval/disapproval.  After  final  approval  has  been  coordinated,  process  the  ASL load, change, update, or delete transaction. AFMC enters the approval date based on the  desired  expiration  date  on  the  Adjusted  Stock  Level  Load  or  Adjusted  Stock Level  Approval  Date  Update  transaction.  This  action  loads  the  approval  date  and establishes  the  ASL  detail  record  as  confirmed  (FIRM).  The  suspense  copy  can  be destroyed. 2.2.5.8.2.  For  AFMC-managed  requests,  an  Adjusted  Stock  Level  Approval  Date Update must not be processed until an approval is received.  If this input is processed before  materiel  manager  approval,  is  obtained  the  materiel  manager  will  return  an ASL reject transaction with a reject code "R." When this occurs, AFMC will process an  Adjusted  Level  Validation  input  with  an  asterisk  in  position  73  that  blanks  the 22 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 approval  date  and  changes  the  ASL  detail  from  firm  to  memo.  See  Adjusted  Stock Level Load, Change, Delete Transaction (1F3) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. 2.2.5.8.3.  When  an  ASL  Reject  Notification  is  received  from  the  materiel  manager and  there  is  an  approved  authorization  on  file,  contact  the  appropriate  materiel manager.  Refer  to  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Stockage  Procedure  for  ASL  Reject Notification (XE5) transaction processing. 2.2.5.8.4.  New ASL requests will be reviewed for supportability for NSNs coded as Obsolete (AAC V or Y), AF Inactive, or NSNs assigned NPPC 2, 3, 5 or 9. When an ASL is required for this type of item, then the requestor must submit an AF Form 86 or coordinate with the IMS/ES at the owning AFMC Air Logistics Complexes to re-catalog  the  NSN.  The  new  level  may  be  approved  after  the  AF  Form  86  action  is completed  and  the  NSN  is  stock  listed  and  procurable.  ASLs  are  authorized  for obsolete items with an active repair contract. These items are coded obsolete with no plans  for  future  procurement;  they  have  an  active  repair  contract  to  support  the weapon  systems.  Note:  Previously  existing  ASLs  are  authorized  if  an  AF  Form  86 action has been submitted. When exception codes are loaded to prevent future usage, the special levels will be deleted. 2.2.5.8.5.  ASLs  are  not  authorized  for  stock  numbers  with  ERRC  "ND"  and  "NF”. Exceptions  are  TLF  D  Maximum  Level  Zero  and  Non-AFMC  managed  ERRC “NF1”. 2.2.6.  Exception Management 2.2.6.1.  Exception Codes 2.2.6.1.1.  Exception codes are assigned to item records when exception processing is necessary  for  the  management  of  excesses,  requisitions,  shipments  and  issues. Personnel  at  AFMC  will  manage  the  exception  code  program.  The  LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  is  responsible  for  all  locally  assigned  exception  codes.  See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 [EEX/SEX] and Ch 5 [IEX/REX] for exception code processing instructions. 2.2.6.2.  Exception Phrases 2.2.6.2.1.  Exception phrases are assigned to the ILS-S when exception processing is necessary  for  the  management  of  excesses,  issues,  requisitions  and  shipments. Personnel  at  AFMC  will  manage  the  exception  phrase  program.  See  AFH  23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more information concerning exception phrase record creation and management. Section 2C—Financial Management 2.3.  Financial Management. 2.3.1.  Due-Out Obligation Procedures. 2.3.1.1.  Purpose: Explains how to obligate an organization’s Operation and Maintenance (O&M)  funds  on  selected  due-outs.  Two  basic  methods  are  used  to  obligate  due-outs:  Due-out obligation flag and Due-out obligation/de-obligation transaction input 1DO. For AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 23 policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use  AFH 23-123. 2.3.1.2.  The  procedures  described  in  this  paragraph  do  not  apply  to  TEX  code  8 equipment due-outs, TEX code H due-outs, or TEX code D due-outs. 2.3.1.2.1.  The LRS/Materiel Management Activity or AFMC (for accounts under the AFMC support) will turn on the due-out obligation flag in the base constants record in the appropriate ILS-S. 2.3.1.2.2.  When  this  flag  is  turned  on,  all  customer  due-outs  will  obligate  when processed. 2.3.1.2.3.  Funds  Requirement  Card  (FRC)  or  Special  Requisition  (SPR)  inputs  to firm  unfunded due-outs  will obligate if  funds are available, and the  requisition  is  to routing identifiers other than D(xx), JBR, or J(nn). 2.3.1.3.  Due-Out  Obligation.  This  method  does  not  check  for  funds  availability  and could  lead  to  over-obligation  of  funds.  If  the  previous  year's  O&M  funds  are  to  be obligated; the budget officer must also approve the use of this process. Refer to Due-Out Obligation/Deobligation Input (1DO) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for processing. 2.3.1.3.1.  When the fiscal year of obligation is blank, the customer due-out was firm and obligated before 30 September of the previous fiscal year, but because of an error the date of obligation is now blank. In this case, use the previous year Accounting and Finance (A&F) Stock Fund Due-Out Reports to obtain the fiscal year to be used with the Due-out Obligation transaction. 2.3.1.3.2.  When  the  due-out  is  incorrectly  canceled,  the  customer  due-out  was obligated before 30 September of the previous fiscal year, LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel incorrectly canceled the customer due-out. In this case, reestablish the due-out with the same document number and the same fiscal year of obligation, as reflected on previous A&F Stock Fund Due-Out Reports. 2.3.1.3.3.  When an item record indicative data change rejects, it may be necessary to deobligate  the  due-out,  cancel  the  due-out,  reestablish  the  due-out  using  the  same document number, and obligate with the original fiscal year of obligation using Due-Out Obligation transaction. 2.3.1.3.4.  Any other circumstances not previously identified that cannot  be resolved by the local budget office, warranting obligation of a due-out using prior fiscal  year O&M funding, requires MAJCOM Budget approval with MAJCOM SMAG manager coordination prior to processing. 2.3.1.3.5.  An industrial funds organization is an organization that provides a service or product to another military service or government agency. Customers pay for these services  and  products.  AF  activities include Transportation  Working  Capital  Fund  (sales  code  49),  CSAG-Maintenance  (sales code  63  series),  and  other  AF  industrial  funds  (sales  codes  48,  62,  69).  When  the funding for these services or products is not linked to a specific year of appropriation, due-outs for industrial funds items are always obligated with current year funds. industrially that  are funded 2.3.2.  Budget Code Z Investments. 24 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 2.3.2.1.  Purpose: To explain steps required before loading Budget Code Z item records. For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use AFH 23-123. 2.3.2.2.  Once the budget code has been assigned, it usually is not changed until the end of  the  fiscal  year.  This  prevents  excessive  changes  between  investment  funds  (major appropriations) and stock and/or Operations and Maintenance funds. AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Ch 8, provides the criteria for determining whether or not an investment equipment item is authorized a budget code Z. 2.3.2.3.  Budget code Z is initially assigned to locally funded equipment items with a unit cost  of  $250,000  or  more.  These  items  are  funded  through  one  of  three  appropriations: major  procurement  appropriation  for  other  procurement  (57*3080);  other  RDT&E procurement  (57*3600);  or  NIMA  procurement  (97*0300.4802).  Two  materiel acquisition  control  records  are  maintained  for  each  System  Designator  (S/D).  One  will always  be  for  procurement  appropriation  57*3080.  The  second  may  be  for  other appropriations  authorized  by  HQ  USAF  see  Materiel  Acquisition  Control  Record (MACR) Load, Change, Or Delete Input (1LM) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 to load MACR for Budget Code Z. 2.3.2.4.  The SMAG manager should review applicable records before submitting O&M budgets  to  the  base  budget  office  to  allow  for  tentative  budget  code  changes  that  will affect  budget  submissions  for  57*3600  and/or  57*3080  appropriations  and  C-SAG Operating Program. 2.3.2.5.  Coordination with Records Maintenance personnel to change budget code Z. For more  information  on  assignment  of  Budget  Code  9/Z  reference  Assignment  of  Budget Code 9 in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8. 2.3.3.  Validating WRM Funding Requirements. 2.3.3.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  validation  process  of  Operational  RSPs  such  as CHPMSK,  HPMSK,  IRSP,  MRSP,  and  MSK  funding  request  procedures  process.  For policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use  AFH 23-123. 2.3.3.2.  Overarching  guidance  for  War  Reserve  Materiel  Program  is  contained  in  AFI 25-101,  Air  Force  War  Reserve  Materiel  (WRM)  Program  Guidance  and  Procedures.  WRM/Readiness  Spares  Packages  (RSP)  Requirements  (Q07/NGV848)  is  required  in direct support as described in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5. 2.3.3.3.  General  validation  process.  WRM/RSP  report bases/MAJCOMs to determine and identify WRM and Operational RSP shortages. is  designed  for  use  by 2.3.3.3.1.  WRM obligation authority is a firm limitation that is fenced and cannot be exceeded.  If  requirement  exceeds  the  approved  obligation  authority,  WRM  Global Manager M/AFMC must request additional funds from AFMC/FM. 2.3.3.3.2.  The  WRM  community  must  fund  for  procurement  of  new  WRM  funding requirements  through  the  congressional  budgeting  Program  Objective  Memorandum (POM). AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 25 2.3.3.3.3.  When  WRM  items  are  used  to  satisfy  MICAP  requirements,  these  items are  replaced  with  SMAG  operating  obligations  authority.  WRM  items  should  be rotated  with  like  peacetime  assets  to  the  extent  possible  to  assure  their  continued serviceability.  When,  WRM  assets  become  unusable  or  outdated,  replacement  is considered  an  initial  procurement  of  new  WRM  and  must  be  acquired  with  GSD WRM  obligation  authority  and  identified  to  HQ  AFMC  on  the  GSD  Operating Program for additional WRM funding. GSD only has obligation authority to purchase WRM when specifically provided with additional Stock Fund Contract Authority. 2.3.3.3.4.  The  CSAG  WRM  obligation  authority  will  be  used  to  finance  CSAG budget  code  8.  GSD  SMAG  obligation  will  be  used  to  finance  budget  code  9  GSD RSP  requirements.  Assets  will  be  maintained  on  detail  records  and  are  included  in ILS-S inventory until they are consumed and expensed. 2.3.3.4.  WRM/RSP  Requirements  (Q07/NGV848)    Report  Process.    The  following actions will be performed to validate requirements for WRM funding: 2.3.3.4.1.  AFMC  will  coordinate  quarterly  with  the  LRS  to  validate  unsupportable requirements for host and satellite activities. turn, 2.3.3.4.2.  In WRMO/NCO  and  outside  agency  RSP  monitors requirements and notifies AFMC when the review is complete. (T-2). the  LRS  will  coordinate  quarterly  with installation to  validate  unsupportable the 2.3.3.4.3.  Applicable WRM/RSP monitors will correct erroneous details and remove the output or change it before submitting the file. All outputs containing valid details for items that should not be funded immediately because of lack of storage space (i.e., deicing fluid, engine oil, etc.) or local availability (i.e., liquid oxygen, demineralized water, etc.) will be removed from the file. 2.3.3.4.4.  AFMC  will  conduct  an  annual  WRM  GSD  budget  call  to  obtain  WRM requirements to be included in the GSD Program Budget Review (PBR). 2.3.3.4.4.1.  Submit the Approved Operating Budget (WRM funding requirement) to HQ AFMC/FMR for inclusion in the Budget Estimate Submission (BES) sent to SAF/FM. 2.3.3.4.4.2.  AFMC/FM  gathers  requirements  from  MAJCOM  and  includes  in their PBR submission to SAF/FM. 2.3.3.4.4.3.  Based  on  Command  War  Reserve  Materiel  Officer/Non Commissioned  Officer  (CWRMO/NCO’s)  POMs,  SAF/FM  will  determine  if O&M  funds  are  approved  for  purchasing  initial  WRM  assets.  When  O&M  is approved,  SAF/FM  will  provide  AFMC/FM  the  additional  stock  fund  authority for distribution to MAJCOMs. Note: CWRMO/NCO’s that did not identify WRM requirements in their POM will not receive WRM GSD funds. 2.3.3.4.5.  Budget  execution  for  GSD  begins  with  SAF/FM  by  annual  funding distribution  to  AFMC/FMR,  down  to  the  SMAG  Manager,  who  distributes  to  the bases where GSD WRM funds are executed. 2.3.3.4.5.1.  WRM obligation authority received by MAJCOMs from AFMC/FM will be distributed to bases with requirements identified and a POM submitted by 26 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 CWRMO/NCO under PEC 28031 and/or 41135. 2.3.3.4.5.2.  Load funding when WRM GSD is received and identify to the WRM Global  Managers  (ACC/A4RX)  base  SRAN  and  GSD  amount  available  for spending.  Note:  Funding  is  provided  by  priority  and  dollar  value  for  the  assets identified on the last Q07 processed. 2.3.3.4.5.3.  Load obligation authority to MACR Update Code (MUC) 20 in GSD Materiel Acquisition Control Record (MACR). 2.3.3.4.5.4.  AFMC will load funding and notify  the host or satellite LRS.  Note: Funding  is  provided  by  priority  and  dollar  value  for  the  assets  identified  on  the last Q07 processed. 2.3.3.4.5.5.  Track the spending of the WRM obligation authority and report back to AFMC/FM when spending is completed. 2.3.4.  Apportionment Control. 2.3.4.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  control  of  appropriations  procedures.  For  policy  specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.3.4.2.  Total Financial Authority (TFA) consists of obligation and commitment targets for  operating  and  War  Reserve  Materiel  (WRM).  These  targets  will  be  loaded  to  the MACR,  to  support  requisitions  placed  with  supply  sources  (see  DFASDE  7077.10-M, Standard  Base  Supply  System  User’s  Manual,  for  MACR  update  logic).  Targets  for obligations are limitations that cannot be exceeded. 2.3.4.3.  General appropriations. The approved annual ratio of operating obligations plus credit  returns  to  gross  sales  must  be  achieved  in  order  to  generate  cash  from  sales  to support stock replenishment requirements. Achievement of the approved ratio also aids in the control of SMAG outlays. Reference Unit Cost Ratio (UCR) Impacts in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for items that impact the unit cost ratio. 2.3.4.4.  AOB provides approved credit returns, gross sales, obligations, and an approved ratio of operating obligations plus credit returns to gross sales (unit cost ratio). 2.3.4.5.  During periods of constrained funding, MACR factors must be applied in order to  operate  within  financial  limits  imposed.  The  SMAG  managers  must  continually monitor  the  financial  targets  and  actual  ratio  in  order  to  avoid  an  Anti-Deficiency  Act violation. The following actions will be performed: 2.3.4.5.1.  Operating  obligations  will  be  computed  using  the  worksheet  provided  in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. 2.3.4.5.2.  SMAG  Managers  must  develop  an  operating  program  at  the  lowest management and operating level. 2.3.4.5.3.  Initial  development  is  performed  at  base  level  and  is  reviewed  and consolidated at command and division level. 2.3.4.5.4.  Manage  data  appropriate  to  specific  inventory  and  capital  control objectives are selected from these financial reports see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 27 2.3.4.5.5.  Compare  this  data  with  the  approved  objectives  of  the  operating  program in order to determine the status of the SMAG. 2.3.5.  SMAG MACR Controls. 2.3.5.1.  Purpose: To explain the procedures for MACR factor development and control. For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use AFH 23-123. 2.3.5.2.  General  Procedures.  Unlike  the  OCCR,  Project  Funds  Management  Record (PFMR),  and  Stock  Fund  Inventory  Management  Record  (SFIMR),  which  are  for  data collecting and reporting the MACR serves the purpose of control. The MACR is used to adjust  or  prevent  the  automatic  requisitioning  of  materiel.  Also,  the  MACR  is  used  to change or prevent requisitions undergoing normal computer processing. 2.3.5.3.  Maximum  automatic  obligation  values,  MACR  factors,  and  Urgency  Need Designator  (UND)  Codes  are  used  as  control  data  for  requisitioning.  You  can  load modifications  of  these  values  at  any  time,  use  caution.  Remember  that  the  maximum automatic obligation for replenishment and due-outs cannot be loaded for less than $50. 2.3.5.4.  Four control parameters are available in the MACR record: 2.3.5.4.1.  Urgency of need funding flag. 2.3.5.4.2.  Maximum automatic obligation for due-outs. 2.3.5.4.3.  Maximum automatic obligation for stock replenishment. 2.3.5.4.4.  MACR factors. 2.3.5.5.  The use of MACR factors is preferable during mission changes and other events (such  as  MAJCOM  changes  in  stockage  levels  or  changes  in  supply  levels  dictated  by local authority) that make demand patterns hard to predict. But keep in mind that with use of  the  MACR  factors,  there  is  an  increased  workload,  both  for  depots  and  for  the Distribution  Section.  Using  the  MACR  factor  also  increases  the  chance  of  out-of-stock conditions  and  more  customer  due-outs.  For  these  reasons,  use  the  MACR  factors  only when necessary. 2.3.5.6.  The following actions will be performed: 2.3.5.6.1.  Compute the value of requisitions you anticipate making for the remainder of  the  fiscal  year.

A  narrative  analysis  will  be  prepared  by  AFMC  as  of  the end  of  each  month  and  furnished  to  HQ  AFMC/FMR  NLT  the  15th  day  the  following month. 2.3.6.2.1.  The analysis should provide a comprehensive assessment of the execution of approved unit cost targets. Any variances plus or minus 3 percent must be narrated to  include  but  not  limited  to;  causes,  get-well  date,  mission  impacts  and  actions initiated  to  ensure  execution  within  end-of-year  (EOY)  approved  unit  cost  targets. Specific  emphasis  and  narrative  justification  is  required  for  variances  for  each  unit cost goal. 2.3.6.2.2.  The  narrative  analysis  will  be  prepared  in  the  format  provided  by  HQ AFMC/FMR. Section 2D—War Reserve Materiel (WRM) 2.4.  War Reserve Materiel (WRM). 2.4.1.  WRM Transfers Between Kits. 2.4.1.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  procedures  to  transfer  between  WRM  Special  Spares RSPs.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101,  AFI  25-101  and  for  IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. 2.4.1.2.  General  WRM  transfer  between  kits.  This  section  discusses  procedures  for preparing  and  processing  inputs  to  transfer  assets  from  one  WRM  detail  record  to another.  Input  preparation  is  discussed  first,  followed  by  output  documents,  degraded operations  transfers,  rejects,  and  management  notices.  It  is  important  to  note  that Transfers Between Kits cannot be corrected with record reversal and correction (formerly RVP) and require inputs to correct any processing errors. 2.4.1.3.  The following actions will be performed: 2.4.1.3.1.  For Transfer Between Kits Inputs. 2.4.1.3.1.1.  Leave the action quantity blank when the requirements of the gaining detail  document  number  are  to  be  filled  from  assets  recorded  on  WRM  detail records  specified  by  the  input  stock  number,  system  designator,  and  parameters. The total quantity transferred will be a combination of the following. 2.4.1.3.1.1.1.  The gaining primes. 2.4.1.3.1.1.2.  The  authorized  quantity  minus  on-hand  assets  (including substitutes). 2.4.1.3.1.1.3.  The  due-outs  (except  when  due-out  action  flag  M  is  used) (Refer to MSK/MRSP/WRM Transfers Between Kits (1KT) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 ). 2.4.1.3.1.1.4.  When processing serialized reporting assets, process a Weapons Serialized Control Input (DSR) or Serialized COMSEC Control Input (XHB) prior  to  processing  the  Transfer  Between  Kits.  Serialized  reporting  assets cannot be transferred using the Transfer Between Kits multiple option. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 29 2.4.1.3.1.2.  When output of documents is not desired and there is a need to enter specific quantities, enter a 6 in the input TEX code position. 2.4.1.3.1.3.  Enter Due-Out Action Flag M when due-outs are not to be considered in  the authorized versus on-hand computations, and the program  will ignore any due-outs.  An  “Excess  Due-Out  Details  Resulted  From  the  Use  of  Due-Out  Flag M”  (F202)  management  notice  will  be  produced  when  due-outs  are  greater  than on-hand quantities. 2.4.1.3.1.4.  Transfer  the  resulting  quantity  from  those  assets  recorded  on  the detail record as specified by the first parameter of the input. When the deficiency is not satisfied by the detail record of the first parameter, check the detail record of  the  second  parameter.  Continue  checking  each  parameter  until  all  have  been verified or the deficiency has been satisfied. 2.4.1.3.1.5.  When  the  asset  position  of  the  gaining  detail  record  does  not  match the  authorized  quantity,  an  “On-Hand  Quantity”  Does  Not  Complement  the Authorized  Quantity:  Quantity  Short”  (F206)  management  notice  will  be produced. 2.4.1.3.1.6.  When  an  action  quantity  is  entered,  the  computer  will  transfer  this quantity to and from the detail record specified by the input. 2.4.1.3.1.6.1.  Rejects occur when the gaining detail record asset position and the action quantity exceed the authorized quantity. 2.4.1.3.1.6.2.  Rejects occur when a selected detail record is deployed. 2.4.1.3.2.  For Transfer Between Kits Output Documents. 2.4.1.3.2.1.  The  computer  prepares  a  transfer  document  for  each  Transfer Between  Kits  transaction  (Refer  to  MSK/MRSP/WRM  Transfers  Between  Kits (1KT) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2) unless degraded operations (TEX code 6) is used. 2.4.1.3.2.2.  When  the  transfer  document  is  received,  the  WRM  Manager (WRMM) will do the following. 2.4.1.3.2.2.1.  Clear the suspended creation sheet. 2.4.1.3.2.2.2.  Physically  transfer  the  assets  or  coordinate  with  kit  custodians for the transfer. 2.4.1.3.2.2.3.  Sign the transfer document. 2.4.1.3.2.2.4.  Distribute documents as follows. 2.4.1.3.2.2.4.1.  Copy 1 to Document Control 2.4.1.3.2.2.4.2.  Copy 2 to the losing kit or organization 2.4.1.3.2.2.4.3.  Copy 3 to the gaining kit or organization 2.4.1.3.2.2.5.  When  serialized  reporting  assets  are  transferred,  a  Serial Number List (F117) management notice will be output at function 444. Attach the  management  notice  to  the  applicable  output  document  and  the  property 30 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 being moved. 2.4.1.3.3.  Degraded  operations  Transfers.  When  the  degraded  operations  option (TEX 6) is used, the WRMM will hand-write three copies of the transfer document. After  the  transfer,  the  WRM  monitor  signs  and  distributes  the  documents  IAW  this section 2.4.1.3.4.  Rejects and Management Notices. 2.4.1.3.4.1.  The  WRMM  reviews  rejects  for  corrections  and  reinputs.  When reprocessing is not necessary, the WRMM will remove and destroy the suspense creation sheet and take action to clear any suspended (rejected) transactions. 2.4.1.3.4.2.  The  WRMM  will  review  management  notices  for  necessary  action. When excess due-outs result from processing a transfer, request an inquiry of the gaining detail record document number. Review the due-outs of the gaining detail record  for  possible  cancellation,  cancellation  and  reestablishment  under  a  losing detail record, or any additional applicable action. 2.4.2.  Maintenance of WRM Assets. 2.4.2.1.  Purpose: To explain the procedures to maintain WRM assets. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101, AFI 25-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.4.2.2.  General  WRM  asset  procedures.  An  item  in  WRM  packages,  including  an expendable item authorized by allowance standards, will be managed and maintained to retain proper control and accountability of the assets. 2.4.2.3.  The following actions will be performed: 2.4.2.3.1.  For  WRM  items  requiring  TOC/TCTO  procedures  apply  as  outlined  in Sec. 4B. 2.4.2.3.2.  For  WRM  items  requiring  Shelf-life  inspection  procedures  apply  as outlined in Sec. 5C. and AFI 25-101. 2.4.2.3.3.  For WRM items requiring functional check procedures apply as outlined in Sec. 5C. 2.4.2.3.4.  For redistribution of excess WRM procedures apply as outlined in AFI 25-101. 2.4.2.3.5.  For Inventory of WRM procedures apply as in Section 5G and AFI 25-101. 2.4.2.3.6.  For  requisitions  of  WRM  requirements  procedures  apply  as  outlined  in Sec. 5B, and AFI 25-101. (BEAR)  and  Fuels 2.4.2.3.6.1.  Basic  Expeditionary  Airfield  Resources Operational Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE) due-outs/requisitions will have the following WRM project codes assigned: 2.4.2.3.6.1.1.  For initial/increased requirements use WRM project code DCP. 2.4.2.3.6.1.2.  For  replacement project code DCP. initial/increased  requirements  use  WRM AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 2.4.2.3.6.2.  Basic outs/requisitions will have the following WRM project codes assigned: Expeditionary  Airfield  Resources (BEAR) 31 due-2.4.2.3.6.2.1.  For BEAR operational requirement use BEAR project code L86 for budget code Y. 2.4.2.3.6.2.2.  For  BEAR  operational  requirements  use  BEAR  project  code L87 for training use. 2.4.2.3.7.  For  funding  of  WRM  requirements  procedures  apply  as  outlined  in  Sec. 2C, and AFI 25-101. 2.4.2.3.8.  For WRM Equipment items procedures apply as outlined in Sec. 5D,  and AFI 25-101. 2.4.3.  War Consumable Distribution Objective (WCDO) Detail Records. 2.4.3.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  WCDO  Detail  Record  procedures.  For  policy  specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and AFI 25-101. For IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.4.3.2.  General WCDO Detail Record procedures. The WCDO is classified based on the classification  for  each  line  of  activity  in  the  War  and  Mobilization  Plan,  Volume  4 (WMP-4),  published  annually.  The  minimum  classification  for  any  WCDO  extract (unit/base) is SECRET. 2.4.3.3.  The following actions will be performed: 2.4.3.3.1.  For accounting for WCDO Details. support  authorizations  and  assets  are 2.4.3.3.1.1.  WCDO stored  on WRMWCDO-SPARES  (241)  detail  records  and  accounted  for  on the WCDO/WRM  Munitions  List  (R07).  Use  organization/shop  code  002WR  and activity code W for detail document numbers. Account separately for rations and petroleum,  oils,  and  lubricants  (POLs).  Follow  MAJCOM  provided  guidance identified in WMP-4/WCDO cover letter. 2.4.3.3.1.2.  Geographical Location Pseudo-Base codes (GEOLOC PBC). WCDO PBCs  are  assigned  by  Logistics  Feasibility  Analysis  Capability  (LOGFAC) classified  system  managed  by  ACC/A4RX.  Annually  a  unique  PBC  is  assigned for every GEOLOC with WCDO requirement. GEOLOC to PBC relationship can be  cross-referenced  in  LOGFAC.  PBCs  when  associated  with  an  actual  location or Base Code is classified SECRET. the  PBC  shown in 2.4.3.3.1.2.1.  Load the WRMWCDO-SPARES  detail  records.  The  PBC  of  the  Alternate  Storage Location  (ASL)  is  entered  in  position  62-65  and  the  PBC  of  the  Planner Operating  Base  (POB)  is  entered  in  positions  66-69  of  the  WCDO  load, change, and delete. the  WCDO  report into 2.4.3.3.1.2.2.  For  PBCs  not  contained  in  the  WCDO  document,  contact CWRMO by SIPR. CWRMO will query LOGFAC and notify base via SIPR of  the  PBC.  Bases  will  enter  the  PBC  in  positions  62-65  and  66-69  of  the WCDO load, change or delete. 32 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 2.4.3.3.2.  WCDO  Requirements.  WRM  spares  detail  records  account  for  two  kinds of  authorizations,  as  shown  in  the  annual  HQ  USAF  Non-Airborne  RSP  (NARSP) Authorization,  Document,  Volume  II.  The  WRMM  will  process  the  applicable WCDO load, change, and delete (see WCDO Load, Change, And Delete (TRIC 1CK) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2) to load the total WCDO authorizations. 2.4.3.3.2.1.  The  authorized  quantity  field  of  each  input  must  reflect  the Operational  Plan  (OPLAN)  Starter  Quantity  identified  on  the  WCDO.  The  total authorization  is  the  sum  of  supportables  and  unsupportables.  Enter  the unsupportable  quantity  in  the  appropriate  field  when  directed  by  CWRMO.  The supportable  and  unsupportable  quantities  are  maintained  on  the  same  detail.  To request  WRM  ordering  authority  for  General  Support  Division  SMAG requirements, see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 and AFI 25-101. 2.4.3.3.2.1.1.  Authorizations  can  be  loaded  with  or  without  using  the automatic  issue  program.  When  the  automatic  issue  program  is  used  the processor will create a WCDO detail record and create an issue request input and process the issue. 2.4.3.3.2.1.2.  Attempting  to  use  the  automatic  issue  program  on  details  with unsupportability codes loaded will result in (F215) management notice. 2.4.3.3.2.2.  When  notified  by  the  AFMC  SMAG  manager  that  a  fiscally restrained unsupportable authorization has become supportable, the WRMM will follow these instructions: the  change 2.4.3.3.2.2.1.  Part  unsupportable.  When  only  part  of  the  assets  authorized become  supportable,  process the  new unsupportable quantity in the unsupportable quantity field.  The  change input to  decrease  the  unsupportable  quantity  cannot  contain  issue  data.  Prepare  an issue  request  according  to  Expendable  Item  Customer  Issue  Request  (ISU) Transaction Format and Documentation Requirements in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the new supportable quantity with WRM project code DCP. input  and  enter 2.4.3.3.2.2.2.  Unsupportable  details  becoming  supportable.  If  the  total authorization becomes supportable, process a change by inputting an asterisk (*)  in  the  supportability  code  field  and  zeros  in  the  unsupportable  quantity field. Prepare an issue request according to Sec. 5B, for the new supportable quantity with WRM project code DCP. 2.4.4.  WRM Special Spares Readiness Spares Packages Detail Records. 2.4.4.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  WRM  Special  Spares  Readiness  Spares  Packages  (RSP) Detail Record procedures. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and AFI 25-101. For IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.4.4.2.  The following actions will be performed: 2.4.4.2.1.  For accounting for (Special Spares) Details. 2.4.4.2.1.1.  Special Spares support authorizations and assets are stored on WRM SPECIAL SPARES (233) detail records with type spares code H and established, maintained and deleted by Special Spares load, change, delete and receipt. WRM AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 33 special spares RSP authorizations are accounted for on the Special Spares Listing (R34). Use activity code U and MAJCOM Special Spares Authorization Letter or email to identify shop code for detail document numbers. Section 2E—Degraded Operations 2.5.  Degraded Operations. 2.5.1.  Manual Accounting during Degraded Operations. 2.5.1.1.  Purpose: Describe the manual accounting during degraded operations procedures process. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123 and the ES-S User Guide. 2.5.1.2.  These  procedures  apply  to  AFMC,  LRS,  satellite  accounts,  and  all  assigned  or attached  activities  that  maintain  records  on  or  receive  support  from  the  ILS-S.  These procedures  are  to  be  used  in  the  event  the  ILS-S  (in  whole  or  in  part)  is  not  available. AFMC  supported  bases  will  coordinate  degraded  operations  with  AFMC  Control  Team Chief (CTC). 2.5.1.3.  Degraded Operations. Degraded operations will meet the requirements of normal operations, but the extent the processes are performed and the application of technology used  to  perform  them  will  vary  depending  on  the  situation.  Scenarios  that  may  drive materiel  management  activities  into  degraded  operations  are  described  in  Supply Automated  Systems  Availability  Scenarios  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  2.  Degraded operations  will  be  tailored  to  each  situation  based  on  mission  requirements.  As  soon  as the  need  for  degraded  operations  becomes  apparent  the  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity and AFMC will advise customers that their support may be limited. 2.5.1.3.1.  Transactions  are  processed  on  a  case  by  case  basis  (normally  based  on mission  impact)  with  close  coordination  between  the  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity,  AFMC,  and  the  sources  of  supply.  When  the  situation  dictates,  some transactions  may  be  held  and  processed  individually  after  recovery  is  complete.  For example,  a  single  equipment  transaction  that  was  worked  off-line  during  degraded operations  might  be  held  and  processed  individually.  The  CTC  will  be  involved  in decisions to withhold transactions from recovery. Degraded operations do not impede physical movement (transfer/deployment) of spares and equipment. 2.5.1.3.2.  Degraded  operations  documents  are  created to  move  assets.  Kit deployment/transfers  are  processed  as  part  of  or  immediately  after  system  recovery (e.g.,  transactions  that  occur  at  home  station  prior  to  kit  deployment/  transfer  are processed prior to application of the deployment indicator. Transactions occurring at the deployed site are processed after the kit deployment/transfer has processed). 2.5.1.3.3.  Computer products/listings  will be used to  record transactions  and update inventory information as needed. See Base Level Data Required to Support Degraded Operations in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. 2.5.1.3.4.  Transactions  will  be  prepared  in  legacy  straight-line  format  (flat  file)  and processed as part of the degraded operations recovery. 34 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 2.5.1.3.5.  Sequence  transactions.  Ensure  transactions  are  sequenced  for  recovery. Sequencing  must  be  precise  to  avoid  rejects.  See  Degraded  Operations  Backlog Processing Sequence in  AFH 23-123,  Vol 2, Pt  1, Ch 2 for the degraded operations backlog processing sequence. 2.5.1.4.  Duration.  When  a  planned  outage  is  projected  to  last  less  than  24  hours,  the Control  Team  Chief  can  elect  not  to  formally  activate  the  Control  Team  (CT).  Hold transaction processing until system is available. When the outage (planned or unplanned) is projected to be more than 24 hours, then degraded operations will be declared and the CT will be activated. The CT will not be activated for normal weekends and holidays. 2.5.1.4.1.  Materiel  Management  activities  should  not  expect to  process  all transactions  during  degraded  operations  (even  if  the  operation  extends  for  an extraordinary length of time). The capabilities of suppliers must be considered during the  operational  assessment,  i.e.,  if  suppliers  are  also  in  a  degraded  mode  then significant limitations on additional transaction processing may need to be continued. 2.5.1.5.  Functional  Area  Procedures.  Common  procedures  applicable  to  all  functional areas are described below. 2.5.1.5.1.  Prepare  for  Degraded  Operations.  Preparations  for  degraded  operations actually  begin  before  the  ILS-Ss  goes  down  and  before  degraded  operations commence.  Each  functional  area  will  ensure  they  are  able  to  access  the  computer products  (reports/listings/data  files)  and  forms  needed  to  fulfill  their  primary  duties during degraded operations. Specific data needed during most degraded operations is addressed  in  Base  Level  Data  Required  to  Support  Degraded  Operations,  AFH  23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. Note: Electronic media may be used instead of physical forms as long as the information contained in the media meets the intent. 2.5.1.5.2.  Update  Computer  Products.  Ensure  transactions  are  posted  to  applicable computer  products  as  the  transaction  occurs.  This  will  ensure  the  viability  of  the computer product throughout the degraded operation. 2.5.1.5.3.  Enforce  Controls.  Special  handling  must  be  enforced  during  degraded operations.  Each  functional  area  will  ensure  that  special  handling  continues  to  be applied  as  warranted.  Check  item  record  attributes  for  Controlled  Item  Codes, Serialized Report Codes, TCTO, NPPC, Suspect, Functional Check, Shelf Life, ESD, and  Exception  Codes  (Issue,  Shipment,  and Requisition)  and  apply  special  handling as  required.  Place  special  emphasis  on  the  control  of  pilferable,  classified  and NWRM. 2.5.1.5.4.  Recovery  Files.  As  transactions  are  made,  create  transaction  images  in legacy  straight-line  (80-320  position)  (flat  file)  format.  When  ILS-S  is  available  for recovery processing, ensure applicable 4-position SRAN is appended to the beginning of  each  transaction  image  prior  to  batch  processing.  Follow  example  found  in  ES-S Batch Processing, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. Limit batch transactions to 250 or less images. 2.5.1.5.5.  Prepare auditable documents. Prepare DD Form 1348-1A, DoD Single Line Item  Release/Receipt  Document  to  facilitate  the  movement  (issues,  shipments, transfers,  and  releases)  of  assets  during  degraded  operations.  When  Asset AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 35 Management  System  is  available  then  document  labels  can  be  used  for  on-base movements.  See  Preparation  of  DD  1348-1A,  (ISU/MSI/DUO/DOR/A2x/SHP/A5J Documents)  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for  more  information  on  the preparation of DD Form 1348-1A. 2.5.1.5.6.  Quality Control. Ensure transactions are correctly prepared prior to end of day  merge  or  more  often  if  required  to  avoid  rejects  during  recovery  processing. Verify  data  on  input  images  match  what  is  reflected  on  the  reports/accountable documents (for example, NSN, unit of issue, quantity, document number, and system designator  match  what  is  reflected  on  computer  products  and/or  forms  such  as  AF Form 2005, Issue/Return Request or DD Form 1348-1A). 2.5.1.6.  Specific Functional Area Procedures. 2.5.1.6.1.  Customer Support Liaison. 2.5.1.6.1.1.  Call-in points will accept issue requests and perform research actions based on CTC guidance. Requirements accepted but not qualifying for processing will be held and input after recovery. 2.5.1.6.1.2.  Load item and support records during degraded operations. 2.5.1.6.1.3.  Support  the  screening  of  incoming  receipts  and  returns  for  due-out release  action.  A  list  of  serviceable  assets  maintained  in  the  FSC  will  be consolidated  with  the  list  of  serviceable  assets  held  in  Receiving  so  asset availability can be quickly determined. 2.5.1.6.1.4.  After  recovery  is  complete,  perform  quality  control  on  all  auditable documentation for accuracy. Quality control standards and procedures outlined in Quick  Reference  Guide  For  DD  1348-1A  Quality  Control  Edits,  AFH  23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5, are also applicable to degraded operations documents. Confirm all degraded operations documents have been process in the ILS-S. 2.5.1.6.2.  Requisitioning.  During  degraded  operations,  requisitions  are  processed  as offline requisitions. Ensure all new MICAP due-outs (TEX 7) are added to the High Priority  MICAP  Boards  if  available  (see  ES-S  User’s  Manual).  When  ES-S  is  not available, call in new MICAP backorders to AFMC. Only when directed by AFMC, forward  all  Stock  replenishment  Issues  (TEX  6)  and  Non  MICAP  backorders  to AFMC  will  create  offline  requisitions  for  authorized  items  using  the  procedures outlined  in  Special  Requisition  (SPR)  Transaction,  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5 and  the  requisitioning  process  outlined  in  Requisitioning,  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1, Ch 2 used during degraded operations. 2.5.1.6.3.  Receiving.  CTC  prescribes  what  receipts  are  processed  using  degraded operations  procedures.  Perform  normal  receipt  actions  as  outlined  in  AFI  24-203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo. A list of all serviceable items held in receiving  will  be  maintained  and  screened  against  incoming  asset  requests  (issues, shipments, etc.) as requested. AFI-24-203 provides guidance on the receiving process used during degraded operations. 2.5.1.6.4.  Asset  Management  storage  operations.  Storage  operations  conducts  asset availability  checks  (to  include  lateral  sourcing  requests)  as  needed  and  notifies  the 36 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 requestor/call-in points of asset availability. Stock will be processed for issue/release as directed. The CTC determines if some or all stock will be binned. 2.5.1.6.5.  Flight  Service  Center  (FSC).  Maintain  control  of  items  Due-In  From Maintenance (DIFM). The FSC will accept  and process  returns as prescribed by the CTC.  Normal  in-checking  and  inspection  functions  for  serviceable  returns  apply  as explained  in  of  this  manual.  Serviceable  returns  will  be  screened  for  dueout  release action  and  reparable  items  will  be  evacuated  as  directed.  DIFM  Return  in  AFH  23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 provides guidance on the DIFM process used during degraded operations. 2.5.1.6.6.  Quality  Assurance  (QA).  Monitor  the  entire  degraded  operations  process, to  include  attending  and  observing  transaction  recovery.  AFMC  will  manage  the entire degraded operations process at their level. LRS Quality Assurance function will ensure an After Action report is created and submitted using the Sample After Action Report Template found in, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. (T-2) 2.5.1.6.7.  Inventory  personnel  will  be  available  to  the  CT  for  lifting  freezes  that result from erroneous processing. This section/element collects and processes Special Inventory Request notices that result from Insufficient Quantity rejects. 2.5.1.6.8.  Computer Operations/Functional Systems Management. The LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  and  AFMC  will  configure  ILS-S  to  support  degraded operations (to include Recovery). Any incoming System interface processing should be  suspended  until  recovery  is  complete.  Base  level  interfaces  (maintenance, transportation,  etc.)  will  be  evaluated  and  disabled  if  needed.  When  IT  System  is available, set the recovery flag for Degraded Operations. Assign processing capability to users designated by the CTC. 2.5.1.6.9.  Other  Areas  Not  Specifically  Addressed.

Readiness Spares Packages and Kits. 2.6.1.  Procedures for Unsupportable Package Requirements. 2.6.1.1.  Purpose:  To  load,  change,  or  delete  kit  and  package  detail  records’  authorized quantities  for  RSP.  Package  detail  records  account  for  two  kinds  of  authorizations, supported and unsupported. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.6.1.1.1.  Use blank for the supportability code for fully supportable authorizations. 2.6.1.1.2.  Use F for authorizations which may not be requisitioned because of base or command fiscal restraints (no funds available). AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 37 2.6.1.2.  General Unsupportable Package maintenance Procedures. The following actions will  be  performed  for  the  loading,  changing,  or  deleting  of  unsupportable  RSP requirements: 2.6.1.2.1.  Load of Total Authorization. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity RSP package  manager  must  load  the  total  package  authorization.  (T-2).  The  authorized quantity  field  of  each  input  must  reflect  the  total  authorization,  which  includes  the sum  of  supportables  and  unsupportables.  Then,  enter  the  unsupportable  quantity  in the applicable field. The supportable and unsupportable quantities will be maintained on the same detail. 2.6.1.2.1.1.  For RSP, HPMSK, and CHPMSK input screen see Airborne Mobility Readiness Spares Package (AMRSP)  Load, Change,  Inquire, Delete and Receipt (1UB) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. 2.6.1.2.2.  Load  authorizations  using  automatic  issue  program.  Processes  an  issue  to establish a due-out for new supported quantities see Expendable Item Customer Issue Request (ISU) Transaction Format and Documentation Requirements in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 2.6.1.3.  Issue  for  Shortages.  To  request  an  issue  as  changes  are  being  made  to  the supportable  detail  record,  processes  a  do  not  requisition  issue  See  Expendable  Item Customer Issue Request  (ISU) Transaction Format and Documentation Requirements in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. When the computer program processes the issue, items will  be  issued  from  the  warehouse  to  balance  the  package  detail,  or  a  due-out  for  the quantity will be issued. If the full quantity is issued, remove the special requirements flag from the unsupportable due-in detail record and link the due-out and due-in together. 2.6.1.4.  Supportability  Change.  When  notified  by  the  AFMC  SMAG  manager  that unsupportable  authorization  has  become  supportable,  the  WRM  manager  will  follow these instructions. 2.6.1.4.1.  Part  unsupportable.  When  only  part  of  the  assets  authorized  become supportable, process the change input and enter the new unsupportable quantity in the unsupportable quantity field. The change input to decrease the unsupportable quantity cannot  contain  issue  data.  Prepare  an  issue  request  according  to  Expendable  Item Customer Issue Request (ISU) Transaction Format and Documentation Requirements in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the new supportable quantity. 2.6.1.4.2.  Total  Unsupportable.  When  the  total  authorization  becomes  supportable, process a change by inputting an asterisk (*) in the supportability code field and zeros in  the  unsupportable  quantity  field.  Prepare  an  issue  request  according  to  AFH  23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the new supportable quantity. 2.6.1.5.  Unsupportable  Package  Requirements  are  managed  by  MAJCOM  RSP Managers  and  units  will  be  directed  to  make  changes  as  needed  to  meet  mission requirements. 2.6.1.5.1.  MAJCOM RSP Managers will: 2.6.1.5.1.1.  Perform  a  quarterly  supportability  code  validation  to  identify  items requiring new loads and to ensure existing codes and unsupportable quantities are 38 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 correctly applied. 2.6.1.5.1.2.  Review  RSP  details  using  Air  Force  Approved  Ad-Hoc  Database Systems  script  to  determine  whether  or  not  supportability  code  F  applies  (on  an item by item basis) for new additions. 2.6.1.5.1.3.  Ensure  details  with  or  without  existing  supportability  codes  have correct unsupportable quantities loaded. 2.6.1.5.1.4.  Notify  applicable  units  of  new  additions  or  changes.  Date  and  file listing manually or electronically until next validation. 2.6.2.  Establishing and Maintaining Detail Records for RSP. 2.6.2.1.  Purpose:  To  create  and  maintain  RSP  detail  records.  For  policy  specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.6.2.2.  General  procedures  to  load,  change,  and/or  delete  or  postpone  RSP  detail records.  The  following  procedures  will  be  used  to  establish  and  maintain  RSP  detail records: 2.6.2.2.1.  Use  MAJCOM  RSP  Listing.  Use  the  listing  and  records  received  from Lead MAJCOM as authority to load, change, or delete RSP detail records. to  determine  how joint  review  with 2.6.2.2.2.  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  conducts  a maintenance the  MAJCOM  provided authorizations.  Ensure  en-route  support,  existing  taskings  to  multiple  operating locations  and  maintenance  repair  facilities  are  taken  into  consideration.  Configure non-airborne MRSP according to employment repair capabilities. to  best  segment 2.6.2.2.3.  Assign  Shop  Codes.  Assign  shop  codes  to  identify  a  kit/package  or kit/package increment. The first position specifies the kit number and the second the part or container. Conduct a joint review with maintenance to determine how to best segment  the  MAJCOM  provided  authorizations.  Ensure  en-route  support,  existing taskings  to  multiple  operating  locations  and  maintenance  repair  facilities  are  taken into consideration. In all cases, airborne MRSP must be configured in a manner that will support the unit's mobility concept. Configure non-airborne MRSP according to employment repair capabilities. Bases will ensure the sum of all authorizations does not  exceed  the  total  MAJCOM  authorized  quantity.  All  airborne  and  non-airborne MRSP  will  have  standard  shop  codes  with  the  first  and  second  position  alpha  code identifying the investment the XD2 segment. Non-airborne MRSP will use a separate shop code for each supported end item. 2.6.2.2.4.  Process transaction to load the detail. See AMRSP Load, Change, Inquire, Delete and Receipt (1UB) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for all input formats that apply  to  each  type  of  asset.  When  the  information  has  been  processed  and  verified, retain authorization listings or files until superseded by new authorization files. 2.6.2.3.  Postponing Repairs. When an item is issued from a deployed MRSP kit/package but  repair  of  the  damaged  reparable  item  is  postponed  until  the  deployment  is  over, process the issue from MRSP detail records, using TEX W. 2.6.3.  Mission Support Kits (MSK). AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 39 2.6.3.1.  Purpose:  To  load,  change,  inquire,  delete,  and  receipt  for  Mission  Support details. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.6.3.2.  General  procedures  to  load,  change,  inquire,  delete,  and  receipt  for  Mission Support  details  MSKs.  Personnel  in  Asset  Management  or  organizational  personnel (when  MSKs  are  maintained  at  organizational  level)  will  perform  the  following procedures to maintain MSKs: 2.6.3.2.1.  Establishing  Authorization  Numbers.  Each  authorized  item  will  be assigned  an  item  number  which  will  be  used  as  the  last  four  positions  of  the  detail record document number. 2.6.3.2.2.  Processing  Formats.  Use  format  and  processing  procedures  outlined  in MSK Load, Change, Inquire, Delete, and Receipt (1MK) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 to load, change, inquire, and delete a Mission Support Kit. 2.6.3.2.3.  Adding  to  an  MSK.  When  adding  or  increasing  an  MSK  detail  record, compare the total combined authorized quantity of all mission support kit and supply point detail records to the requisition objective. A reject stating the input quantity plus supply point and MSK authorization quantity exceed the requisition objective (R/O) will  be  produced  if  the  combined  authorized  quantity  exceeds  the  R/O.  Load  or change the detail record accordingly. Bases must either increase the R/O by adding a special level or decrease the MSK and supply point detail record authorized quantity. (T-2) When bases do not accomplish this requirement computation process the result will  be  a  management  notice  stating  the  supply  point  and  MSK  authorized  quantity exceeds the R/O. 2.6.3.2.4.  Establishing  New  Codes  for  MDS.  If  an  MSK  supports  multiple  MDS, unique shop codes should be assigned to each MDS. This will allow classification by MDS on the MSK Listing. 2.6.3.2.5.  Manual Processing. When the applicable IT system is not available, follow degraded operations procedures found in Sec. 2E, for transaction processing. 2.6.4.  WRM Authorizations and Reconciliations. 2.6.4.1.  Purpose:  Describe  the  general  procedures  associated  with  steps  taken  before processing  WRM  authorizations,  processing  the  WRM  authorizations  and  performing WRM  reconciliation.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.6.4.2.  General  procedures  for  steps  taken  before  processing  WRM  authorizations, processing the WRM authorizations and performing WRM reconciliation. The following actions will be performed: 2.6.4.2.1.  Material  Management  personnel  must  make  sure  they  have  received  the entire WRM authorization file. 2.6.4.2.2.  Processing the WRM authorizations 2.6.4.2.2.1.  Lead  MAJCOM  RSP  managers  will  develop,  create  and  ensure  the MAJCOM  WRM  Serial  Number  Authorization  Record/WRM  Authorization 40 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Input  Record  images,  commonly  referred  to  as  the  XVF/XTJ  files,  are  loaded annually,  no  earlier  than  1  Aug  and  no  later  than  30  Aug.  These  images  are provided to ILS-S by either manual download/upload or automatically through the WS-MIS  REALM  PC  interface.  RSP  managers  will  coordinate  with  base  Asset Management Section prior to  initializing RSP reconciliation.  RSP managers will notify base Asset Management personnel when files are ready for reconciliation. See ES-S User’s Manual for RSP Reconciliation procedures. 2.6.4.2.2.2.  WRM  Base  Authorization  Input  Processor.  When  Computer Operations notifies Asset Management of the processed WRM authorization file, Asset  Management  personnel  initiate  the  WRM  Base  Authorization  Input Processor  on  any  terminal  that  has  demand  mode  capability.  See  MAJCOM WRM  Serial  Number  Authorization  Record  (XTJ)  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1, Ch 2 for procedures to process the WRM Base Authorization Input Processor. 2.6.4.2.3.  WRM Base Authorization Input Processor List. When the option to create WRM  authorization  input  list  is  taken,  the  computer  will  output  a  WRM  base authorization  input  list  to  help  Asset  Management.  This  list  helps  in  loading  or changing  WRM  serial  number/control  record(s),  segments  the  WRM  Authorization Input  Record,  and  assigns  the  shop  codes  and  item  numbers.  See  MAJCOM  WRM Serial  Number  Authorization  Record  (XTJ)  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  2  for WRM  base  authorization  input  screen  selection  format.  The  computer  outputs  the WRM Base Authorization Input Processor list in the following sequence: 2.6.4.2.4.  Major  command  WRM  serial  number  authorization  input  record  by SRD/UTC. 2.6.4.2.5.  WRM authorization input record by national stock number/ SRD/UTC. 2.6.4.2.6.  Initiating WRM Base Authorization Input Processor. After completing the actions  required  on  the  WRM  base  authorization  input  list,  initiate  the  WRM  Base Authorization  Input  Processor  process  to  add  and/or  change  the  applicable  WRM details. The computer will enter the add/change images of the applicable WRM detail load/change  in  the  pseudo  reader  to  process  or  create  a  disk  file  for  review  prior  to processing. 2.6.4.2.7.  WRM Base Authorization Input Processor Scan Option. After completing all  adds,  changes,  or  deletes,  Asset  Management  should  process  the  WRM  Base Authorization  Input  Processor  scan  option  to  make  sure  all  the  WRM  authorization input records have  been  processed completely.  When any WRM authorization input records have not been completely processed, the computer will produce a WRM base authorization input list. Then Asset Management must complete processing for those WRM  Authorization  Input  Record  authorizations  which  appear  on  the  WRM  Base Authorization Input Processor list. 2.6.4.3.  WRM Reconciliation. 2.6.4.3.1.  When  Materiel  Management  personnel  are  satisfied  that  all  WRM  Base Authorization files have properly uploaded into ILS-S, they should schedule a WRM Reconciliation.  When  necessary,  the  WRM  Base  Authorization  may  be  reloaded  to AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 accommodate  any  changes Reconciliation until no discrepancies exist. to the  records.  Continue  processing 41 the  RSP 2.6.4.3.2.  WRM  Reconciliation  processing  procedures.  Process Reconciliation in the following way: the  WRM 2.6.4.3.2.1.  After  WRM  Base  Authorization  files  have  been  properly  uploaded into ILS-S proceed with the WRM Reconciliation. The reconciliation is complete when there are no variances or indicative data changes remaining. 2.6.4.3.2.2.  The  Materiel  Management  Flight  Officer,  LRS  CC/AO,  or  ranking individual  of  the  tenant  activity  responsible  for  the  kit  shall  verify  the reconciliation. 2.6.4.3.2.3.  The  authorizing  MAJCOM  and  Lead  MAJCOM  will  verify  that  the reconciliation has been completed. 2.6.4.4.  Contingency  Reconciliation  Processing.  RSPs  transferred  to  the  AOR,  in accordance  with  established  milestones,  MAJCOM  RSP  managers  will  develop,  create and load the WRM authorization files (XTJ/XVF images) annually in ILS-S. 2.6.4.4.1.  In  order  to  meet  required  milestones,  complete  all  actions  detailed  in  this section within 30 days after receipt of the master authorization files for each type of RSP (MRSP/HPMSK). 2.6.4.4.1.1.  Managing  MAJCOMs  will  determine  if  the  reconciliation  will  be performed for RSPs expected to transfer in less than 60 days. Extensions must be requested in writing via message or letter to Managing MAJCOM RSP managers. A complete explanation and expected completion date must accompany extension request. 2.6.4.4.2.  Quantity  Variances  (Changes).  For  details  with  reduced  authorizations, process applicable TRICs (based on type spares code) to reduce authorized quantities but  retain  items  resulting  in  excess  on-hand  balances  in  the  RSP.  Process  due-out cancellations  if  assets  are  not  on-hand.  Turn  in  all  excess  property  upon  return  to home station. (T-2). 2.6.4.4.3.  Detail  No  Matching  XVF  Authorization  (Changes).  For  details  with  on-hand balances change the authorization to  unsupportable and  retain items as excess. Process due-out cancellations and decrease/delete authorizations if assets are not on-hand.  Turn  in  all  excess  property  upon  return  to  home  station  and  delete  all unsupportable details. (T-2). The unsupportable details are the only discrepancies that MAJCOM RSP managers will approve. 2.6.5.  Resource  Readiness  (formerly  the  Status  of  Resources  and  Training  System  or SORTS) of Readiness Spares Packages. 2.6.5.1.  Purpose:  Describe  the  general  procedures  associated  with  Resource  Readiness reporting methods, for obtaining and reporting WRM/RSP Fill Rates. Minimum Required Products  and  Skills  to  Support  ASM  Assessment  Processes.  For  policy  specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 42 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 2.6.5.2.  General.  These  procedures  reference  and  implement  guidelines  in  AFI  10-201, Force Readiness Reporting. 2.6.5.3.  The available methods for Resource Readiness reporting are the Weapon System Management  Information  System  Sustainability  Assessment  Module  (WSMIS  SAM, D087C), PC-Aircraft Sustainment Model (PC-ASM), and Enterprise PC-ASM (EASM). These  procedures  will  take  you  through  the  entire  assessment  and  Resource  reporting process for RSPs. 2.6.5.3.1.  WSMIS SAM. This is an AFMC mainframe computer system that assesses all Air Force  airborne RSPs using standard methodology. Each supply account  with RSPs  and  the  Forward  Supply  Support  (FSS)  System  reports  their  asset  position  by processing  the  weekly  MAJCOM  Combat  Supplies  Management  System  (CSMS) Reconciliation  Report  R30  to  Wright-Patterson  AFB.  AFMC  processes  the  R30  for RSPs for regionalized accounts and RSPs transferred to AFMC managed locations. 2.6.5.3.2.  PC-ASM. For bases with multiple weapon systems and/or MAJCOM units assigned  under  one  system  designator,  the  host  LRS/CC  or  equivalent  should  be responsible  for  ensuring  PC-ASM  is  used  for  Resource  Readiness  reporting.  Upon completion  of  the  base  level  annual  RSP  Reconciliation,  each  MAJCOM  will download their applicable Dyna-METRIC Microcomputer Analysis System (DMAS) files from WSMIS SAM and forward these files to the applicable units for use in PC-ASM. Upon receipt from the MAJCOM, base RSP personnel will import the DMAS file into PC-ASM for each applicable Kit Serial Number (KSN) identified in the War Mobilization Plan (WMP), Volume 3 – Combat and Support Forces. Note: The next step  must  be  performed  in  PC-ASM  operating  on  a  classified  computer.  As  each  of the KSN’s are loaded into PC-ASM, the pertinent WMP, Volume 5 – Basic Planning Factors and Data Scenario information must also be loaded. When MAJCOM directs changes  to  the  RSP  (i.e.  adds,  changes,  or  deletes  outside  of  the  reconciliation period), they will provide using bases with the updated DMAS file to import into PC-ASM. In order to obtain the current retail level WRM and POS on-hand assets for all Mission  Design  Series  (MDS)  RSPs  being  reported  by  the  unit  in  Resource Readiness,  the  reporting  base  will  prepare  and  submit  AF  Form  2011,  Base  Supply ADPE  Work  Request  to  schedule  the  required  PC-ASM  Report(s),  (R26/NGV776) from  the  host  computer  operation  section.  It  is  critical  that  both  the  PC-ASM  RSP files  and  the  R-26  are  set  up  on  OPLAN-tasked  and  DOC-response  -time  sequence. The  MAJCOM  will  include  the  sequence  numbers  on  the  annual  MRSP  load  letter. Resource Readiness reporting will be accomplished on the 1st of each month or next duty  day  should  it  fall  on  a  weekend  or  holiday  and  problem  parts  must  be aggressively worked at that time. Results/Problem parts are included in the Resource Readiness  report  to  include  detailed  status  of  the  parts  and  the  impact  on maintenance. review  process  and 2.6.5.3.3.  EASM.  AFMC  is  responsible  for  the  development  of  EASM  assessments for RSP Resource Readiness reporting. Each year, upon completion of the MAJCOM RSP subsequent  posting  of  current  Dyna-METRIC Microcomputer  Analysis  System  (DMAS)  files  into  WMIS-SAM,  the  AFMC  will extract  and load the applicable RSP data for each ASM  assessed Kit  Serial  Number (KSN)  identified  in  the  WMP,  Volume  3.  As  each  of  these  KSN’s  are  loaded  into AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 43 ASM, the pertinent WMP, Volume 5 scenario information are loaded. On the 1st of each month or next duty day should it fall on a weekend or holiday, the AFMC will provide  a  consolidated  R-26  to  update  ASM  with  the  current  retail  level  WRM  and POS  on-hand  assets  for  each  Mission  Design  Series  (MDS)  assessed  within  ASM. Problem  parts  will  be  identified  as  the  result  of  the  assessments,  and  passed  to  the applicable weapon system spares management team for analysis and action. 2.6.5.4.  For fill rates see Figure 2.3. 2.6.6.  Performing and Interpreting PC-ASM Assessments. 2.6.6.1.  Purpose: Describe the general procedures associated with performing initial PC-ASM assessment. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.6.6.2.  General  procedures  to  perform  initial  PC-ASM  assessment.  The  following actions will be performed. 2.6.6.3.  For  most  units  the  reported  assessment  from  PC-ASM  is  the  “availability  % (Method  Z)”,  which  cross  references  to  Figure  2.3.  Applicable  rules  (9-20)  from  the DRRS  Reference  Tables  located  on  the  SIPR  Department  of  Defense  Readiness Reporting  System  (DRRS)  https://drrs.ffc.navy.smil.mil/DrrsEnhancedPortalWeb). For  strategic  airlift  only,  the  sortie  generation  capability  (method  “Y”)  is  used  and  is accomplished  only  via  WSMIS/SAM  as  a  “fleet”  rating.  Strategic  (C-5/C-17)  bases  are not required to perform PC-ASM assessments. This fleet assessment rating is computed via  WSMIS/SAM,  and  the  results  can  be  obtained  directly  from  WSMIS/SAM  via SIPRNET.  Even  if  the  kit  assessment's  sortie  percentage  equates  to  an  S-1  level,    the model  will  generate  problem  parts  if  a  single  stock  number  exceeds  the  ENMCS threshold, which is the inverse of the DSO for the RSP’s Primary Aircraft Authorization. Refer to AFI 23-101 for DSO information. 2.6.6.4.  Once the PC-ASM assessment is completed, produce the Problem Parts List. To do  so,  click  on  “Print  Summary  &  Problem  Parts”  to  identify  any  problem  parts  as  a result of the PC-ASM assessment. 2.6.6.5.  When  your  MRSP(s)  assessed  to  S-1  and  has  not  generated  any  problem  parts you  are  finished  with  PC-ASM  and  ready  to  fill  out  Resource  and  Capability  readiness information.  When  an  assessment  is  less  than  S-1  and/or  problem  parts  are  identified contact AFMC for further research and assistance. 2.6.7.  Performing and Interpreting EASM Assessments. 2.6.7.1.  Purpose:  Describe  the  general  procedures  associated  with  AFMC  performing initial  EASM  assessments.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.6.7.2.  General  procedures  followed  by  the  AFMC  to  perform assessments. initial  EASM 2.6.7.2.1.  Load current FY D087C WSMIS/SAM. DMAS files into ASM. 44 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 2.6.7.2.2.  On a SIPR system, add MDS applicable War Mobilization Plan Volume 5 (WMP-5) scenario data for Resource Readiness worksheets (hours/sortie, sortie rate, and max sortie, decel rates if applicable). 2.6.7.2.3.  Load R-26 on-hand spares data into ASM. 2.6.7.2.4.  Within  EASM,  there  are  two  methods  in  which  the  R-26  assets  may  be allocated  to  the  Fleet  RSPs:  Fleet  Proportional  and  Fleet  Priority  schemes.  Fleet Proportional  allocation  spreads  POS  and  spares  evenly  based  on  the  authorizations with  the  goal  of  bringing  all  KSNs  to  the  same  equivalent  performance  level  and generally achieve a higher fleet overall assessment. Fleet Priority allocation fills top priority RSPs optimally until availability target or item authorization is reached. This method provides a flexible option for assessing different scenarios. i.e. filling an RSP tasked  for  deployment.  AFMC  will  utilize  the  Fleet  Proportional  allocation  scheme for monthly RSP assessments. The Fleet Priority allocation scheme will be utilized to initially robust RSPs identified in WMP Volume 4, Wartime Aircraft Activity (WAA) Operational  Plan  (OPLAN)  and  Contingency  Plan  (CONPLAN)  with  Type  Phase Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) scenarios. 2.6.7.2.5.  Assess RSP. EASM will perform modeling assessment and provide results on  the  Fleet  Assessment  Output  tab.  RSP  kits  are  listed  in  priority  sequence  with Fleet Size, ENMCS data, Availability flown percentage. The fleet size is equal to the Primary Aircraft Authorization (PAA) of the MDS weapon system supported by the RSP  kit.  The  availability  flown  percentage  is  the  percentage  of  the  PAA  supported that  are  expected  to  be  FMC  (fully  mission  capable)  at  the  completion  of  the assessment scenario. 2.6.7.2.6.  After processing each unit and MDS fleet assessment, AFMC will update the monthly RSP assessment data located on the SIPR EASM SharePoint and forward assessment to  Defense  Readiness  Reporting  System  (DRRS-S) personnel. information 2.6.7.3.  AFMC shall make EASM outputs available to  the  LRS/CC or equivalent  to  be utilized  at  their  discretion  unless  directed  by  MAJCOM  to  utilize  EASM  results  for Resource  reporting.  These  EASM  output  files  provide  units  with  the  A/A  and  the ENMCS  reporting  categories  for  determining  the  health  of  the  MRSP(s).  The  first category  is  the  aircraft  availability  (A/A).  This  is  the  primary  measured  category  for determining  your  S-Level  for  Resource  reporting.  (Refer  to  AFI  23-101  for  Direct Support  Objective  (DSO)  information.  Even  if  the  sortie  percentage  equates  to  an  S-1 level,  problem  parts  are  generated  if  a  single  stock  number  exceeds  the  ENMCS threshold, which is the inverse of the DSO for the RSP’s PAA. 2.6.7.4.  Problem  parts identified during the EASM monthly assessment  process  will be annotated  on  the  applicable  fleet  RSP  assessment  data  located  on  the  SIPR  EASM SharePoint.  AFMC  will  review  identified  problem  parts  and  take  corrective  actions  to resolve. 2.6.7.5.  When  your  MRSP(s)  assessed  to  S-1  and  has  not  generated  any  problem  parts you are finished and ready to  fill  out  your Capability Readiness Assessment worksheet. When an assessment is less than S-1 and/or problem parts are identified contact AFMC AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 45 for  further  research  and  assistance.  EASM  provides  the  capability  to  enhance  the  asset position  and  thus  obtain  assessments  that  are  more  robust  by  including  all  locally available assets and enterprise wide assets if applicable. 2.6.7.6.  As Requested  Assessments. AFMC will  process  out-of cycle  assessments upon request.  Situations  that  may  require  an  out-of-cycle  assessment  are  contingency deployment  computations,  destruction  and  reconstitution  assessments  of  spares  due  to natural  disaster,  fire,  war,  etc.  ASM  assessment  requests  shall  be  submitted  to  AFMC. Figure  2.1  provides  the  minimum  information  required  for  a  contingency  deployment computation. Figure 2.2 provides the minimum information required for RSP destruction and reconstitution assessment. Figure 2.1.  Deployment Computation Request Format. PROPER CLASSIFICATION XX Month 20XX     MEMORANDUM FOR 635th SCOW/XXX FROM:  111th Logistics Readiness Squadron SUBJECT:  Deployment Computation Request 1.  The 111th LRS requests a Mobility Readiness Spares (MRSP) deployment computation on Kit Serial Number(s) (KSN) 0F015C0D111A to determine if additional assets are required to support the projected deployment flying scenario. PC-ASM Scenario Data: Unit:                                                                111th LRS KSN(s):                                                          0F015C0D111A Home Station SRAN:                                     FB1111 Deployment SRAN:                                       FB1112 Time Frame:                                                   45 Days Projected Deployment Date:                          4 Jul 2012 Primary Aircraft Authorization (PAA)          111 Planned Sorties:                                              11 Sortie Duration: (Note)                                  1.1 hrs Max Sortie Rate:                                            11 Decel Rate if applicable:                                1.11 2. The 111th  LRS POC for this deployment computation request is MSgt Ima Sergeant,    DSN 123-4567. IMA T. SERGEANT, MSgt, USAF 46 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Note:  Determination of additional assets to support the projected scenario is dependent on the sortie duration time frame.  This is contingent on the number of planned sorties, the maximum sortie rate and other factors.  These factors will vary depending on the given circumstances. NCOIC, MRSP 2.6.8.  Working Assessment Shortfalls. 2.6.8.1.  Purpose:  Describe the  general  procedures associated with Working Assessment Shortfalls.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.6.8.2.  General  procedures  to  perform  to  work  assessment  shortfalls.  Host  and  tenant units must work together to prevent “double counting” assets, correct ILS-S Audit Report mismatches, and research problem parts. The following steps will be performed. 2.6.8.3.  Ensure DIFM assets are properly coded and can be repaired on base. If not they need to be returned to the depot and requisitioned. 2.6.8.4.  Initiate Supply/Command assistance actions to AFMC on potential single failure component  parts.  (This  is  not  necessary  if  your  weapon  system  and  depot  use EXPRESS). 2.6.8.5.  Coordinate  with  Maintenance  to  determine  the  impact  each  problem  part  will have on the wartime mission and to identify any additional assets that may be available for  use,  e.g.,  Special  Purpose  Recoverables  Authorized  Maintenance  (SPRAM)  assets, cannibalized  assets  from  Backup  Aircraft  Inventory  (BAI),  Attrition  Reserve  (AR) aircraft, and Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) coded aircraft. 2.6.8.5.1.  These problem  parts are identified by NSN in  the ESSA1 Remarks  Label along  with  authorized  quantity,  RSP  balance,  other  serviceable  base  assets,  a description  of to  perform cannibalizations, and actions taken to resolve the problem. the  problem,  anticipated  maintenance  man-hours 2.6.8.5.2.  Verify  SPRAM  assets  are  in  serviceable  condition  and  assets  would  be available  within  DOC  response  time.  The  time  must  include  removal,  inspection, packing,  palletizing,  and  marshaling.  Consider  only  assets  which  maintenance  can reasonably cannibalize in the pre-deployment phase within DOC response times from BAI,  AR,  and  PDM  coded  aircraft.  Ensure  BAI/AR  aircraft  are  available  for cannibalization and not being used to backfill a grounded war-tasked aircraft. Aircraft in PDM status located off base will not be considered for cannibalization plans. 2.6.8.5.3.  After  applying  these  additional  wing  assets  to  the  appropriate  RSPs  in PCASM,  rerun  the  PC-ASM  assessment.  Cannibalized  or  other  base  assets  that  are available  can  only  be  applied  against  RSP  shortfalls  once,  not  applied  against  each squadron independently. Remember, to reload the wartime flying scenario before you run the enhanced PC-ASM assessment (refer to the security portion of the classified flying scenario message). 2.6.8.5.4.  This  second  enhanced  PC-ASM  assessment  will  normally  increase  both sorties  generated  and  aircraft  availability.  Use  AFI  10-201,  to  convert  the  PC-ASM results to the Capability Readiness Assessment percentage and S-Level. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 47 2.6.9.  Post-Capability Readiness Assessment Actions. 2.6.9.1.  Purpose:  Describe  the  general  procedures  associated  with  post  Capability Readiness  Assessment  follow-up  actions.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.6.9.2.  General  procedures  for  Post  Capability  Readiness  Assessment  pro-active actions. The following actions will be performed by AFMC: 2.6.9.2.1.  Units  with  PC-ASM  capability  will  continually  review  the  status  of problem parts and pacing items, and coordinate with stock control to generate follow-ups/supply assistance requests when the LRS CC/AO has authorized this action. 2.6.9.2.2.  Compare EXPRESS Tables and D035C with applicable IT system records. 2.6.9.2.2.1.  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activities  should  compare  the  D035C reported  asset  position  and  the  EXPRESS  tables  on  the  PC-ASM  generated problem parts to ensure accurate D028/RAMPS reporting. 2.6.9.2.2.2.  In D035C, verify the reported demand level, WRM level, serviceable Peacetime  Operating  Stock  (POS)  balance,  WRM  balance,  Due  In/On-Hand DIFM,  and  in-transit  serviceable  levels  are  correct  when  compared  to  your applicable IT system records. 2.6.9.2.2.3.  EXPRESS  tables  should  be  reviewed  to  ensure  the  depot  has  these parts with  the proper Resource readiness values,  and scheduled for repair and/or distribution. 2.6.9.2.2.4.  The applicable IT system must initiate any corrective actions, not the Item Manager. A return maybe required to correct a DIFM problem, or releveling may be needed to correct a D028 problem with a WRM or POS level, etc. 2.6.10.  Home Station Consumable Readiness Spares Package (CRSP) Processing. 2.6.10.1.  Purpose:  Describe  the  general  procedures  associated  with  home  station  CRSP processing.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.6.10.2.  General  procedures  to  perform  loading  and  requisitioning  of  home  station CRSP packages. The following steps will be performed: 2.6.10.3.  Loading  CRSPs.  When  a  CRSP  package  is  not  required  for  an  imminent deployment  or  contingency,  the  withdrawal  flag  on  each  RSP  detail  will  be  set  to  "Y" thereby  allowing  unrestricted  issues  and  lateral  support  shipments  from  CRSPs.  The automatic  withdrawal  flag  will  be  set  to  "N"  when  a  deployment  or  contingency  is imminent  to  restrict  withdrawals.  See  MRSP/IRSP  Serial  Number  And  Control  Record Change in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for additional information about loading RSP withdrawal  flags.  When  the  CRSP  is  segmented  into  multiple  packages,  the  combined Total  Wartime  Requirement  (TWR)  for  all  RSP  details  for  each  stock  number  will  not exceed the MAJCOM-computed TWR for the stock number for that SRAN. 2.6.10.3.1.  Implementing  CRSP  via  RSP  Details.  This  chapter  provides  the procedures for establishing RSP details. The MAJCOM can specify the use of either the MRSP or IRSP. 48 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 2.6.10.4.  Requisitioning  CRSP  Assets.  Use  standard  RSP  fill  procedures  to  requisition CRSP requirements. The quantity requisitioned and maintained as a CRSP package at the home  station  is  the  RSP  TWR  quantity.  the  Contingency  Flag  Review  process  will initiate  requisition  modifier  transactions  as  appropriate  to  ensure  the  pertinent  base requisition quantities up to the TWR are assigned CRSP project codes and priorities. The Contingency  Flag  Review  is  the  process  used  to  modify  the  JCS  project  flags  and JCS/Intra-Air Force project codes on replenishment requisition transactions. 2.6.11.  Storage and Maintenance. 2.6.11.1.  Procedures for Storage and Maintenance all RSP. 2.6.11.1.1.  Purpose:  Provide  guidance  on  storing  and  maintaining  RSPs.  For  policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for  IT specific  guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.6.11.1.2.  General  procedures  and  requirements  for  storage  and  maintenance  of  all RSP  General  procedures  and  requirements  for  storage  and  maintenance  of  all  RSP. Refer to this manual. 2.6.12.  Independent/Dependent Concept. 2.6.12.1.  Purpose:  Provide  guidance  on  combining  dependent  MRSP  and  independent MRSP to enable single Capability Readiness reporting. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.6.12.2.  Regardless  of  how  the  authorized  MRSP  is  warehoused  or  packaged  for deployment,  it  will  be  reported  as  a  single  MRSP  of  the  Primary  Mission  Aircraft Inventory (PMAI). The dependent MRSP will be combined with the independent MRSP and will be Resource readiness reported as a single MRSP of the combined PMAI. 2.6.12.3.  General  procedures  for  combining  dependent  MRSP  and  independent  MRSP. The  following  procedures  will  be  used  to  establish  the  “working  package”  and computation adjustments for Resource Readiness reporting of the combined PMAI. 2.6.12.4.  When  units  operate  under  the  independent/dependent  concept,  a  "working package" of the combined PMAI must be built. This package will not be listed in the RSP Authorization  Document,  and  will  always  have  an  authorization  factor  of  zero,  because no  such  unit  actually  exists.  The  working  package  and  dependent  MRSP  will  be  built after all file maintenance has been done on the independent package. 2.6.12.5.  Create  the  working  package  by  copying  the  independent  package  to  a  serial number containing the combined PMAI of the independent and the dependent packages, and  an  "N"  in  the  thirteenth  position  of  the  PSN.  In  this  new  "N"  package,  change  the flying hours and Direct Support Objectives (DSO) to reflect the combined PMAI. Create the  dependent  MRSP  by  copying  the  independent  MRSP  to  a  serial  number  containing the  dependent  PMAI  and  an  “N”  in  the  thirteenth  position,  then,  when  necessary, adjusting the flying hours and the DSOs. 2.6.12.6.  The  independent/dependent  operational  concept  requires  adjustments  after  the computation.  The  independent,  dependent,  and  working  packages  are  computed separately. Quantities in the dependent package are then adjusted follows: AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 49 2.6.12.6.1.  The Program Manager (PM) must send the independent and working kits to be computed along with all the rest of the kits. 2.6.12.6.2.  The  SPM  must  create  a  post-computation  database  on  the  REALM  PC server  and  use  the  “TID”  dependent  kit  calculation  tool.  After  entering  the  three  kit serial  numbers  and  executing  the  computation,  the  dependent  kit  will  be  populated. For  computing  items  the  dependent  kit  quantity  is  determined  mechanically  by subtracting  the  independent  kit  quantity  from  the  working  kit  quantity.  For noncompeting  items  the  dependent  kit  receives  the  same  NOP  quantity  as  the independent kit. 2.6.13.  Communications Security (COMSEC) MRSP. 2.6.13.1.  Purpose:  To  identify  additional  requirements  to  manage  COMSEC  items  on MRSP. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.6.13.2.  General  requirements  to  manage  COMSEC  MRSP  details.  The  following additional requirements will be followed for COMSEC MRSP assets: 2.6.13.3.  See Complete Inventory Count Procedures in Chapter 5 for COMSEC MRSP inventory procedures. 2.6.13.4.  Aircraft  Parts  Store  for  the  host  Computer  Support  Base  (CSB)  serves  as  the point of contact for the COMSEC MRSP custodian and helps establish and maintain the MRSP. 2.6.13.5.  When a COMSEC MRSP is transferred, the MAJCOM authorizing the MRSP will identify the computer support base SRAN and COMSEC station number where the MRSP will be transferred. 2.6.14.  Out-of-Cycle Change Requests. 2.6.14.1.  Purpose:  Describe  the  general  procedures  associated  with  submitting  an  Out-Of–Cycle Change Request. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.6.14.2.  Out-of-cycle  change  requests  are  submitted  on  the  AF  Form  1032,  WRM Spares  List,  or  equivalent  for  recoverables  and  for  consumables.  Due  to  the  workload involved, and the impact on package requirements, out of cycle changes should be kept to a minimum. 2.6.14.3.  Coordination  among  the  offices  concerned  is  essential.  when  an  out-of-cycle change  request  is  required,  the  initiator,  the  authorizing  and  Lead  MAJCOM,  and  the SPM  RSP  Manager  must  be  kept  informed  and  given  enough  time  to  take  appropriate action.  Each  office  having  action  on  an  out-of-cycle  change  request  must  promptly acknowledge receipt of messages (to include e-mail), or AF Form 1032. 2.6.14.4.  Changes to economic order quantity (EOQ) items in the CRSP are approved by the  authorizing  MAJCOM.  The  Lead  MAJCOM  will  provide  the  changes  to  the  SPM RSP Manager in the D040 system format. If ten or fewer stock numbers are involved, a message or e-mail may be submitted. 50 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 2.6.14.5.  Changes  to  investment  items  in  an  RSP  are  approved  by  the  SPM  RSP manager,  in  close  coordination  with  the  applicable  IMS/Equipment  Specialist  and  Lead MAJCOM. Requests for changes will be made in AF Form 1032 format (or equivalent). Mandatory  entries  are  the  note  code,  stock  number,  quantity,  work  unit  code,  division code,  the  package  or  end  item  serial  number,  and  the  justification  for  the  proposed change. Once the change is approved, All of the following actions are required otherwise the  RSP  authorizations  and  the  data  files  supporting  readiness  assessments  will  be inconsistent: 2.6.14.5.1.  The  SPM  RSP  manager  must  make  the  change  (as  an  adjustment)  in Reliability Execution Availability Logistics Module (REALM). 2.6.14.5.2.  The  Lead  MAJCOM  RSP  Manager  must  notify  the  impacted  base(s)  of the change. 2.6.14.5.3.  The  Lead MAJCOM RSP Manager must request,  from  HQ AFMC, new ASM files be extracted to support availability assessments. 2.6.15.  Base Level Review of Readiness Spares Package. 2.6.15.1.  Purpose: Describe the general procedures and tasks associated with the annual base level RSP review process. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.6.15.2.  The review is to update the range of items in RSPs and verify the complete set of  data  used  to  compute  quantities  for  those  items.  The  review  will  include  all recoverable  items.  Stock  class  1377  cartridge  actuated  devices  and  propellant  actuated devices  are  exempt  from  annual  review.  Selected  EOQ  items,  to  include  the  following categories, must also be reviewed: aircraft guns, gun components, aircraft wheels, aircraft tires, aircraft brakes and brake components, and others, as agreed between the SPM RSP Manager and Lead MAJCOMs. The review process provides a forum to forecast any RSP add/change/  deletes and  the anticipated cost  to  buy them. The following  actions will be performed: 2.6.15.2.1.  Annually,  the  RSP  packages  are  reviewed.  Authorizations  are  computed from  historical  demand  data  and  programmed  scenarios.  However,  inputs  from  the ALC, MAJCOM, Base RSP managers, and maintenance experts provide information necessary for determining valid authorizations. These tasks are part of the annual RSP review process. 2.6.15.2.2.  Conduct  a  joint  review  with  maintenance  to  determine  how  to  best  to segment  the  MAJCOM  provided  RSP  Authorization  document.  Ensure  existing taskings  to  multiple  operating  locations  and  maintenance  repair  facilities  are  taken into consideration. In all cases, airborne MRSPs must be configured in a manner that will support the unit’s mobility concept. 2.6.15.2.3.  The  Base  RSP  manager  will  schedule  a  face-to-face  base  level  review session  with  maintenance  and  distribute  worksheets  to  lead  technicians.  The  Base RSP Manager will serve as chair and record minutes, forward minutes and results to Lead MAJCOM. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 51 2.6.15.2.4.  MAJCOM RSP/SPM Manager must be informed to review Authorization document  for  accuracy  of  the  following  data:  Look  for  indentured  data  to  the  Next Higher Assembly, Item Type (LRU/SRU), Quantity per Aircraft (QPA) Maintenance Concept, Cannibalization indicator and TO Fig/Index. 2.6.16.  Asset Deployment and Transfer. 2.6.16.1.  Purpose:  Describe  the  general  procedures  associated  with  deploying  and transferring  RSPs.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 2.6.16.1.1.  General  procedures  to  deploy  and  transfer  a  RSP  package  or  package segment from home station to a forward location or base. The following actions will be performed. 2.6.16.2.  Deployment. The movement of a RSP from home station to a forward location or  base,  usually  for  less  than  30  days  are  accomplished  by  processing  WRM  Detail Record Deployment and Return Processor. 2.6.16.2.1.  Not Used  . 2.6.16.2.2.  Not Used  . 2.6.16.2.3.  Losing Base RSP monitor will accomplish the following: 2.6.16.2.3.1.  RSP personnel will process WRM Detail Record Deployment inputs to update the asset status flag on each unit's deployed package detail record.  (T-2). 2.6.16.2.3.2.  Produce  the  applicable  package  list  for  the  RSP  segment  deployed and retain a copy at the home base. (T-2). 2.6.16.2.3.3.  Delete  the  asset  status  flag  immediately  upon  return  after  post deployment  inventory.  After  deployment,  when  the  package  has  returned  to  the home base, process a WRM Detail Record Return to delete the asset status flag. (T-2). 2.6.16.2.3.4.  Update  applicable  IT  system  database  records  by  processing degraded operations recovery files within the IT system immediately after return. (T-2). 2.6.16.2.4.  Losing Base Replenishment. Replenish the deployed package if required, from  the  unit's  home  base  if  airlift  is  available.  Submit  to  MICAP  the  requirements from the host Base Supply for items not available in the package. Once a MICAP is verified,  the  host  Base  Supply  will  take  necessary  action  to  obtain  the  item  using normal MICAP procedures. 2.6.16.3.  Transfer. Deploying units for over 30 days will transfer supply accounts to the AFMC  servicing  the  deployment  theater.  Transfers  are  accomplished  by  processing WRM Detail Record Transfer. See WRM Detail Record Transfer (NGV471) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for select and parameter images. 2.6.16.3.1.  AFMC will provide detailed kit transfer instructions, to include a request for  the  latest  results  of  the  PC-Aircraft  Sustainment  Model  (PC-ASM)  assessment. 52 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 The  deploying  unit  will  use  the  PC-ASM  assessment  to  identify  critical  problem items  and  evaluate  the  overall  spares  posture  of  the  gained  unit.  (T-3).  Kit  transfer procedures will include specific redeployment instructions. 2.6.16.3.2.  Deploying Unit Responsibilities. Use degraded operations procedures for transaction processing during package or segment package transfers. Use the package listing and a log book or local computer products to record all transactions to or from the  transferred  package.  Continue  until  all  information  is  uploaded  on  the  gaining CSB  computer  or  reloaded  at  the  unit's  home  station  after  redeployment.  Document all  package  transactions  regardless  of  which  manual  process  is  used  to  post transactions 2.6.16.4.  Units  that  deploy  to  locations  with  no  ILS-S  capabilities  or  an  active  SRAN will notify their MAJCOMs who will coordinate with Contingency Ops for assistance. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 53 Figure 2.2.  RSP Destruction and Reconstitution Assessment. 2.6.16.5.  Upon  direction  from  AFMC/AFSC  Logistics  Operation  Center/LOC,  the following issuing and robusting rules and procedures govern the transition of spares from the  re-deploying  MRSP.  Contingency  spares  robusting  is  defined  as  issuing  serviceable spares  from  redeploying  MRSP  to  contingency  operating  stock,  to  include  CHPMSK, RSP,  and  POS  where  an  In-place  Readiness  Spares  Package  (IRSP)  and  Total  Wartime Requirement (TWR) exist.  54 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 2.6.16.5.1.  Contingency spares robusting from redeploying unit MRSP's is critical to ensure  effective  positioning  of  spares  to  support  contingency  operations,  without harming the deployed unit’s ability to return to home station. The (E)LRS/CC and/or designated  representative  and  parent  AOR  MAJCOM  will  also  be  advised  of  these procedures  and  may  be  asked  to  assist  the  deployed  unit  in  contingency  robusting actions. Note: When there is not sufficient overlap time between transfer of inbound replacement MRSP and redeployment of outbound  MRSP, robusting to  the inbound MRSP may not be possible. AFMC, inbound/outbound accountable Officer/NCO and (E)LRS/CC will make every effort  to  identify replacement unit MRSP requirements and robust from the redeploying MRSP before departure. 2.6.16.5.2.  When  AFMC  determines  de-robusting  is  necessary  to  support  ongoing operations,  they  will  provide  the  deployed  accountable  Officer/NCO  and  host (E)LRS/CC  a  list  of  recommended  NSNs  and  quantities  to  be  robusted  from  the redeploying  MRSP  to  the  deployed  location  contingency  operating  stocks.  Any disagreement  on  assets  recommended  for  robusting,  from  either  the  deployed accountable  Officer/NCO  or  (E)LRS/CC  should  be  based  on  mission  requirements and communicated to AFMC before redeployment. There may be legitimate reason(s) for  some,  or  even  all,  of  the  assets  recommended  for  robusting,  remaining  in  the redeploying MRSP. Resulting actions taken on each recommended NSN for robusting will be annotated on the list provided by AFMC and returned before physical MRSP redeployment. Decisions to not robust recommended assets to contingency operating stocks  should  be  justified  with  supporting  rational  (Examples:  Assets  required  for redeployment  operations,  warehouse  refusal,  or  other  mission  related  reasoning). Coordination with AFMC/SCOW is the approval authority for any disagreement. 2.6.16.5.3.  When the location is authorized JCS Project Flag A, the outbound MRSP will  release  any  assets  required  to  bring  the  contingency  location's  POS,  CHPMSK, and inbound MRSP on-hand levels to one hundred percent of authorized levels. The authorized level is the sum of the POS, CHPMSK and inbound MRSP levels. 2.6.16.5.4.  When the location is authorized JCS Project Flag B, the outbound MRSP will  release  any  assets  required  to  bring  the  contingency  location's  POS,  CHPMSK, and  inbound  MRSP  on-hand  levels  to  fifty  percent  of  authorized  levels.  The authorized  level  is  the  sum  of  the  POS,  CHPMSK  and  inbound  MRSP  levels.  For example, if the contingency location has a total authorized quantity of four and an on-hand  quantity  of  zero,  the  outbound  MRSP  would  release  two  assets  to  robust  the deployed location levels. When the contingency location had a total authorized level of three and total  on-hand balances of zero, the outbound  MRSP would still release two  in  order  to  bring  the  contingency  on-hand  level  to  the  required  floor  of  fifty percent. 2.6.16.5.5.  When the location is authorized JCS Project Flag C, outbound MRSP will release  assets  required  to  bring  the  sum  of  the  contingency  location's  on-hand  POS, CHPMSK, and inbound  MRSP levels up to one. When the total on-hand quantity is zero  the  outbound  MRSP  is  required  to  release  an  asset  to  robust  Project  Flag  C locations. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 55 Figure 2.3.

This  chapter  outlines  AF  guidance  for  completing  supply  chain  materiel management  processes  associated  with  the  sourcing  of  materiel  activities.  These  activities include  Local  Purchase  and  Retail  Sales;  Receipt  Processing,  Item  Management;  and Diminishing  Manufacturing  Sources  and  Materiel  Shortages.  For  this  chapter,  DoDM  4140.01 and  DoD  4140.26-M  serve  as  primary  DoD  sources  and  various  AF  publications  also  serve  as references. Section 3B—Local Purchase and Retail Sales 3.2.  Local  Purchase  and  Retail  Sales.  This  section  explains  ILS-S  processing  of  local purchase  requisitioning.  Processes  are  explained  concerning  submission,  status,  follow-up,  and reconciliation of local purchase requisitions. 3.2.1.  Local  Purchase  Submission  Procedures.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  is responsible for local purchase requisitions. DoD and AF policy allows for the local purchase of  items  as  another  avenue  to  fulfill  base  requirements.  Local  purchase  provides  another method to obtain low cost items locally, quickly, and efficiently. In the ILS-S, local purchase requisitions are normally assigned routing identifier code (RIC) JBB. 3.2.1.1.  Purpose:  To  provide  local  purchase  submission  procedures.  For  policy  specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 3.2.1.2.  General  Submission  Procedures.  Use  the  following  steps  for  all  local  purchase requisitions. 3.2.1.3.

Copy  3  &  4:  As  locally  determined  when  supported  by  Standard Procurement System (SPS). 3.2.1.4.  LRS/Materiel Management Activity will provide descriptions for local purchase items to base contracting to facilitate loading into the SPS when a new item is loaded into the ILS-S and ILS-S sends a local purchase requisition to the SPS. (T-2). 3.2.1.5.  Follow  general  requisition  steps  for  customers’  orders  IAW  Sec.  5B,  of  this manual. 3.2.2.  Special Submission Procedures. 3.2.2.1.  Purpose: To provide local purchase procedures needed for special requirements. For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use AFH  23-123.  Note:  For  all  submissions,  follow  all  steps  in  this  chapter  and  the following: 3.2.2.2.  Project Buy U.S. (BUSH) for Overseas Bases. When the base is located overseas (OCONUS), the RIC equals JBH (Federal Supply Schedule), and the REX code is not 2, Base Contracting must accept  and process the local purchase requisition to determine if Project BUSH applies. When applicable, Base Contracting will notify Supply to change the  RIC  to  JBG  (Project  BUSH).  When  not  applicable,  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity will assign REX code 2 to the local purchase item record and process a request cancellation for the requisition. The ILS-S will produce a new requisition with the routing identifier code of GSA, DLA, or AFMC. 3.2.2.3.  Mandatory Requirements for Local Purchase of AF-Managed Investment Items. All local purchase requests for AF-managed investment items must be channeled through the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  will record  the  appropriate  demand  and  consumption  data  for  demand-based  stock  leveling purposes. (T-2). Note: Although LRS/Materiel Management Activity may suggest a local contractor  parts  store  as  a  supply  source  for  AF-managed  investment  items,  the  Base Contracting  Office  (BCO)  makes  the  final  decision  on  vendor  selection.  Use  the following instructions to process the local purchase of AF-managed investment items: 3.2.2.3.1.  Establish Retail Supply System Due-In Detail. Process a special requisition (SPR) with RIC JBB, signal  code A, and fund code 64 to establish the due-in detail for AF-managed items (budget code 8, A-H, J-X, or Blank) in the ILS-S. 58 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 3.2.2.3.2.  Provide AF Funding Citation. Acquire a funds citation from the source of supply and manually prepare a DD Form 1348-1A requisition (A0*) transaction. The DD Form 1348-1A will contain the obligation authority and funds citation (received from  the  source  of  supply)  in  Block  3  (Ship  To).  Note:  Do  not  use  local  funds  to locally  purchase  AF-managed  items.  The  depot  source  of  supply  should  provide  a funds citation for the assets. 3.2.2.3.3.  Local Purchase of AF-Managed Recoverable Items. Local purchase of AF managed  recoverable  items  is  also  authorized  following  the  procedures  described above  for  AF-managed  investment  items.  AF-managed  recoverable  items  contain ERRCD  XD2/XF*,  budget  code  8,  and  are  purchased  from  base  CSAG  stock  fund monies.  To  establish  the  due-in  detail  and  create  a  local  purchase  requisition  (A0*) for  AF-managed  recoverable  items  in  the  ILS-S,  process  a  manual  SPR  transaction with  RIC  JBB.  Note:  The  BCO  will  cite  CSAG  stock  fund  monies  to  purchase  the requisitioned items. 3.2.2.4.  Processing Emergency Local Purchase Requisitions. GSA items (budget code 9) with a DLA RIC of S** that have been locally purchased for emergency  situations will be processed according to the following instructions. 3.2.2.4.1.  Special  Requisition  Transaction  Input.  AFMC  and  the  LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel will process a SPR transaction to establish the due-in detail  and  create  an  output  requisition  (A0*)  transaction.  (T-2).  Use  RIC  JBB  in positions 4-6 and S** RIC in positions 57-59 (project code). When the ILS-S assigns the requisition number, leave positions 30-43 blank. When the requisition is prepared offline, enter the offline requisition number in positions 30-43. 3.2.2.4.2.  Special  Instructions  for  Base  Contracting.  Base  Contracting  will  use  the special instructions contained in AF 64 series directives to locally purchase items for DLA (S**) RICs. (T-1). 3.2.2.5.  Local  Purchase  Adjustment  Transactions.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management Receiving function will coordinate with Customer Support Liaison for bulk deliveries to BCE.  (T-3).  Customer  Support  Liaison  will  process  local  purchase  adjustment transactions  in  the  material  management  IT  system  to  adjust  the  requisition  quantity and/or  dollar  value  of  the  requirement  when  they  are  different  from  the  original requisition  quantity  and/or  dollar  value.  (T-2).  See  Local  Purchase  Status  Adjustment (LPA)  Transaction  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  3  for  more  information  concerning local purchase adjustment transactions. 3.2.2.6.  Local Purchase of Compressed Gases. To reduce costs for cylinder handling and transportation,  purchase  industrial  grade  compressed  gases  locally  whenever  possible. The GSA federal supply schedule contains a list of vendors approved for local purchase of  compressed  gases.  If  there  are  not  enough  cylinders  available,  submit  initial  or increased  requirements  for  compressed  gases  to  the  DLA  Aviation  in  the  following manner: 3.2.2.6.1.  Overseas  Activities.  OCONUS  retail  Materiel  Management  Activities submit  a  requisition  for  the  NSN  assigned  to  the  filled  cylinder  if  the  acquisition advice code (AAC) is K and the Federal Stock Class (FSC) is 6830. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 59 3.2.2.6.2.  CONUS  Activities.  CONUS  activities  submit  a  requisition  for  the  NSN assigned  to  the  empty  cylinder  if  the  AAC  equals  D  and  the  FSC  equals  8120. Normally  DLA  Aviation  will  supply  the  empty  cylinder.  Empty  cylinders  are  filled with  gas through local  purchase requisitioning procedures. To satisfy a CONUS  gas cylinder  requisition,  the IM  may  work  with  the  customer  to  substitute  full  cylinders for  empty  ones.  DLA  Aviation  can  take  this  action  only  if  stock  levels  permit,  and there  are  unusual  circumstances  to  justify  the  substitution,  or  the  customer  urgently needs the full cylinder. 3.2.2.6.3.  Requisitioning  Gases.  CONUS  or  OCONUS  activities  will  not  use  DLA Aviation to  requisition any stock number assigned to  gases only  (FSC 6830). These stock numbers are for local purchase only. When local purchase sources are disrupted or unavailable, or when local purchase cannot meet the customer need, DLA Aviation will assist the customer to acquire gas as necessary. In any circumstance, requisitions to DLA Aviation must include either the NSN assigned to the empty cylinder  (AAC D), or the filled cylinder (AAC K), not the gas itself (AAC L). 3.2.2.7.  Requisitioning  Intermodal  (ISO)  Containers.  AFMC  will  contact  the  USAF Intermodal  (ISO)  Container  Manager  at  HQ  AFMC/A4RT,  before  requisitioning  any containers  (FSC  8150).  REX  code  6  will  be  assigned  to  all  NSNs  to  identify  assets requiring ISO containers. 3.2.3.  Local Purchase Requisition Status. 3.2.3.1.  Purpose:  This  section  explains  how  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activities manages status for local purchase requisitions. This section explains the submission and receipt  of  local  purchase  status  from  the  Base  Contracting  Office  (BCO).  For  policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 3.2.3.2.  The  LRS manages local  purchase requisition procedures  for SPS. BCO assigns status  to  local  purchase  requisitions  for  input  to  the  ILS-S  during  daily  (inline) processing.  BCO  produces  a  variety  of  local  purchase  status  transactions  (with  local purchase coding) to the ILS-S to update internal records. 3.2.3.3.  LPS transaction. DoD and AF local purchase status is provided to update status concerning  a  purchase  order  or  contract.  BCO  assigns  the  purchase  order  number  and provides a local purchase status (LPS) transaction to update the purchase order  number, date, and all associated coding on ILS-S local purchase status details. See AFH 23-123, Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  3  for  local  purchase  status  (LPS)  transaction  format  and  processing instructions. 3.2.3.4.  Local  purchase  status  change  transaction.  BCO  provides  local  purchase  status change  transactions  to  the  ILS-S  to  update  local  purchase  requisition  status,  Estimated Delivery Date (EDD), contract number, purchase order number, and the BPA call number in the ILS-S. See Local Purchase Status Change (EDD) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2,  Pt  1,  Ch  3  for  Local  Purchase  Status  Change  transaction  format  and  processing instructions. 3.2.3.5.  Local  purchase  cancellation  (LCC)  transaction.  DoD  and  AF  local  purchase cancellation  status  is  provided  to  cancel  local  purchase  requisitions  or  decrease  local purchase requisition quantities. Base Contracting will provide the LCC transaction to the 60 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 ILS-S for processing. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for LCC transaction format and processing instructions. 3.2.3.6.  Local  purchase  status  adjustment  (LPA)  transaction.  LPA  transactions  are produced by BCO and forwarded to the ILS-S. The LPA transaction primarily notifies the ILS-S of adjustments to either the local purchase price or quantity. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for LPA transaction format and processing instructions. transaction that  provides 3.2.3.7.  Local  purchase  extra  (LPX)  transaction.  The  LPX  transaction  is  a  CEMAS unique the  ILS-S  complete  Procurement  Instrument Identification  Number  (PIIN)  and  contract  year,  from  the  Award  Purchase  Request (AWDPR) file. The LPX transaction may also be used by the LRS/Materiel Management Activity to manually process local purchase detail updates. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for LPX transaction format and processing instructions. 3.2.3.8.  Local  purchase  receipt  acknowledgement  (1RA) transaction.  The  1RA transaction  is  used  to  update  SPS  purchase  order  records.  When  the  LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  or  equivalent  Receiving  function  processes  a  local  purchase receipt,  the  ILS-S  produces  a  1RA  transaction  and  sends  it  to  the  SPS.  See  Standard Procurement System (SPS) Local Purchase Receipt Acknowledgment (1RA) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for 1RA transaction format and processing instructions. 3.2.3.9.  Local  Purchase  Requisition  Cancellation  Request  (AC1)  Transaction.  Requests to  cancel  local  purchase  requisitions  are  created  in  the  ILS-S  through  file  status  or  the manual  processing  of  a  local  purchase  requisition  cancellation  request  transaction.  The ILS-S  computes  and  requests  cancellation  for  due-in  excess  each  time  requirements computation  is  performed.  When  the  ILS-S  computes  due-in  excess,  it  automatically formats  an  AC1  transaction,  assigns  status  code  ZD  to  the  local  purchase  status  detail, and forwards to the SPS. If a manual requisition cancellation request is made, the ILS-S formats an AC1 transaction with status code ZC. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the format and processing instructions for the local purchase AC1 output transaction. 3.2.3.10.  Local  purchase  requisition  cancellation  request  follow-up  (AK1)  transaction. An AK1 transaction is created in the ILS-S if Base Contracting does not reply to the first AC1  transaction  within  10  calendar  days.  Base  Contracting  processes  both  cancellation request  and  cancellation  request  follow-up  transactions  and  automatically  reply  with Local  Purchase  Cancellation  ,  Local  Purchase  Status  or  Supply  Status  transactions  to acknowledge, change, update, or cancel the local purchase requisition. 3.2.4.  Local Purchase Requisition Follow-up. 3.2.4.1.  Purpose: This section explains how requisition follow-up actions are performed for  local  purchase  requisitions.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  is  responsible for local purchase follow-up. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 3.2.4.2.  Local  purchase  requisition  follow-up.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity performs  follow-up  for  local  purchase  requisitions.  Requisition  follow-up  (AF*)  and reinstatement  (AT*)  transactions  are  also  produced  by  the  ILS-S  for  local  purchase requisitions. The type of follow-up transaction produced depends upon whether the status AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 61 detail  contains  status  or  not.  Local  purchase  follow-up  transactions  are  produced  as follows: 3.2.4.2.1.  Local  purchase  requisition  with  status.  The  ILS-S  produces  automated follow-up (AF*) transactions when updated procurement status has not been provided within  established  timeframes.  The  type  of  requisition  AF*  transaction  produced depends  on  the  base  location,  priority,  estimated  delivery  date,  and  the  date  of  last transaction (DOLT). 3.2.4.2.2.  Local  purchase  requisition  without  status.  The  ILS-S  produces  automated requisition  reinstatement  (AT*)  follow-up  transactions  when  initial  procurement status  has  not  been  provided  within  established  timeframes.  The  type  of  requisition follow-up  (AT*)  transaction  produced  depends  upon  base  location,  priority, requisition date, and DOLT. 3.2.4.3.  Action  Required  (ARC)  Report  Transaction  for  Local  Purchase  Requisitions. The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  is  responsible  for  ARC  transactions  for  local purchase  requisitions.  ARC  transactions  create  Status  Details  with  status  code  of  99. Status  codes  9*  are  termed  status  counters.  The  status  counter  identifies  the  number  of follow-up transactions produced for requisitions without status. The status counter begins with 99 for the first follow-up and is reduced by one (1) for each subsequent follow-up transaction  produced.  ARC  transactions  can  be  retrieved  from  Supply  Interface  System (SIFS), which are produced in AT* format, or comparable ILS-S Query for status counter 99 and below. 3.2.4.3.1.  ARC transactions or status counters are created on the third and subsequent follow-ups  for  local  purchase  requisitions.  SIFS  produced  ARC  transaction  position 71 will be blank and positions 72-76 will contain the purchase order number. When BCO has not replied to follow-up transactions within established schedules, an ARC transaction or status counter will be created by the ILS-S and forwarded to Customer Support for processing. 3.2.4.3.2.  The SPS does not accept ARC transactions. Therefore, prior to submission to  Base  Contracting,  Customer  Support  must  review  the  Supply  Interface  System (SIFS) residual file and change the transaction Document Identifier Code (DIC) to the appropriate follow-up transaction DIC or process ILS-S query for counter status and format accordingly. Customer Support  will contact  BCO to  obtain  current  status  for local purchase requisitions that have produced ARC output transactions. 3.2.4.3.3.  When  the  local  purchase  requirement  no  longer  exists,  Customer  Support Liaison  will  process  LCC  transactions  same  day  to  cancel  local  purchase  due-in details. 3.2.4.3.4.  Once  ARC  transactions  or  status  counters  have  been  produced,  no  other automated follow-up (AF*) transactions will be produced by the ILS-S. 3.2.4.3.5.  New  ARC  transactions  or  status  counters  are  programmatically  created every  10  days  until  updated  status  is  processed  in  the  ILS-S,  or  local  purchase requisitions are canceled. 3.2.5.  Local Purchase Requisition Reconciliation. 62 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 3.2.5.1.  Purpose:  To reconcile  Local  Purchases  between the  ILS-S and  SPS. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 3.2.5.2.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  will  process  the  Local Purchase  SPS  Reconciliation  Program  (NGV583)  quarterly  to  perform  a  complete reconciliation of requisitions between SPS and the ILS-S. (T-2). All ILS-S local purchase due-in  details  are  reconciled,  except  those  with  status  codes  Z2  (overseas  foreign procurement)  and  Z3  (valid  description  required).  When  large  numbers  of  mismatched records exist, local management may schedule local purchase reconciliations more often. 3.2.5.3.  Production  of  Local  Purchase  Reconciliation  Header /Local  Purchase Reconciliation  Transactions.  Prior  to  conducting  reconciliations,  the  Local  Purchase Reconciliation  Header  transaction  is  produced.  The  Local  Purchase  Reconciliation Header transaction provides the SPS the base PIIN and SRAN. Customer Support  must contact  the  BCO  to  obtain  the  correct  contracting  installation  numbers  used  for  the reconciliation.  (T-3).  See  Local  Purchase  Reconciliation  Header  (1LH)  Transaction  in AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  3  for  format  and  processing  procedures  for  the  Local Purchase Reconciliation Header transaction. 3.2.5.4.  After  the  Local  Purchase  Reconciliation  Header  is  created,  a  Local  Purchase Reconciliation  transaction  output  image  will  be  produced  for  all  local  purchase requisitions contained in the ILS-S. If status is loaded in the ILS-S for the requisition, the Local  Purchase  Reconciliation to contracting. See Local Purchase Reconciliation (1LP) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt  1, Ch 3 for format and processing information for the  Local  Purchase  Reconciliation transaction. transaction  will  provide  corresponding  status 3.2.5.5.  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  Reconciliation  Processing.  Customer Support requests program SPS Due-in Reconciliation Listing. 3.2.5.6.  BCO  Reconciliation  Processing.  BCO  processes the  Local  Purchase Reconciliation Header transaction header to build a table of the SRANs being reconciled. Once the SRAN table is built, the SPS processes the reconciliation output transactions as follows: 3.2.5.6.1.  When  the  Local  Purchase  Reconciliation  transaction  record  matches  the SPS file exactly, no response will be provided to the ILS-S. The requisition data will be printed on the Reconciliation Matched Listing. 3.2.5.6.2.  When the Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction matches SPS, but the estimated  delivery  date  differs,  the  SPS  sends  the  ILS-S  a  Local  Purchase  Status Change  EDD  transaction  update.  The  requisition  data  will  be  printed  on  the Reconciliation Matched Listing. 3.2.5.6.3.  When  the  Local  Purchase  Reconciliation  transaction  matches  SPS,  but status  is  different,  the  SPS  will  create  a  local  purchase  status  or  local  purchase adjustment transaction for ILS-S processing and update. The requisition data will be printed on the Reconciliation Matched Listing. 3.2.5.6.4.  When the Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction matches SPS, but SPS shows  the  requisition  was  canceled,  the  SPS  will  generate  a  new  local  purchase AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 63 cancellation  transaction  to  cancel  the  requisition  in  the  ILS-S.  The  requisition  will print on the Reconciliation Matched Listing. 3.2.5.6.5.  When  the  Local  Purchase  Reconciliation  transaction  does  not  match  SPS and  the  Local  Purchase  Reconciliation  transaction  does  not  contain  BD  (delayed) status,  the  SPS  will  generate  an  MILSTRIP  Status  transaction  with  BF  (no  record) status  for  ILS-S  requisition  update  action.  The  requisition  will  print  on  the Reconciliation Unmatched Listing. 3.2.5.6.6.  When  the  Local  Purchase  Reconciliation  transaction  does  not  match  SPS and the Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction indicates the contract was awarded, the SPS will generate a MILSTRIP Status transaction with B5 (updated status) status will be provided. The requisition will be printed on the Reconciliation Action Listing - Contracting. 3.2.5.6.7.  When  the  Local  Purchase  Reconciliation  transaction  does  not  match  SPS awarded  contracts  file,  but  the  requisition  has  been  received  by  SPS,  the  SPS  will generate  a  MILSTRIP  Status  transaction  with  Z3  (description)  status  requesting additional  item  description  from  the  ILS-S.  The  requisition  will  be  printed  on  the Reconciliation Matched Listing. 3.2.5.6.8.  When  the  Local  Purchase  Reconciliation  transaction  indicates  requisition assignment to Contracting personnel in SPS, but the requisition has been awarded or suspended  for  further  information,  the  SPS  will  generate  a  MILSTRIP  Status transaction with  BD (delayed) status  for the  ILS-S. The requisition will print on the Reconciliation Matched Listing. 3.2.5.6.9.  When the Local Purchase Reconciliation transaction and SPS indicate BD (delayed)  status,  the  SPS  will  print this  item  on  the  Reconciliation  Action  Listing  –Contracting.  This  action  indicates  offline  research  is  required  for  this  requisition  by contracting. 3.2.5.6.10.  When a SRAN is listed in the Local Purchase Reconciliation Header and no  Local  Purchase  Reconciliation  transaction  is  received  for  records  contained  in SPS, a listing of all the records SPS contains for that account will be printed on the Reconciliation Action Listing for offline research by the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. 3.2.5.7.  LRS/Materiel Management Activity Investigation of Mismatched Records. Upon receipt  of  the  Reconciliation  Unmatched  Listing  and  Reconciliation  Action  Listing, Customer Support actions are: 3.2.5.7.1.  Identify the Reconciliation  Action  Listing  -  and  check  all  mismatched  records  found  during  the reconciliation to find out what caused the problem and take all necessary actions. the  Problem.  Customer  Support  personnel review 3.2.5.7.2.  Verify the Local Purchase Requisition. When the requisition is for a valid requirement,  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  processes  a  SPR  to  load  the requisition.  Additionally,  all  necessary  MILSTRIP  Supply  Status  transaction  inputs will be processed to correct ILS-S due-in details. 64 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 3.2.5.7.3.  Received  Requisition.  When  the  requisition  is  received,  process  a  local purchase receipt acknowledgement transaction and notify Contracting. See SPS Local Purchase Receipt Acknowledgment  (1RA) Transaction in  AFH 23-123,  Vol 2, Pt  1, Ch 3 for 1RA transaction format and processing instructions. 3.2.5.7.4.  Canceled  Requisition.  When  the  requisition  is  canceled,  process  an  AC* transaction and notify Contracting. See Requisition Cancellation Request (AC1/AK1) Output Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for AC* transaction format and processing instructions. 3.2.5.8.  Contracting  Investigation  of  Mismatched  Records.  The  Contracting  Office reviews  the  Reconciliation  Action  Listing  -  Contracting,  to  determine  the  cause  for mismatched  records.  Contracting  personnel  may  request  Customer  Support’s  assistance in correcting their records. Some of the more common requests will be for stock number change  transactions,  and  research  of  supply  records  to  assist  in  correction  of  local purchase requisition mismatches. 3.2.5.9.  Local  Purchase  Reconciliation  Management  Reports.  A  suspense  will  be established to assure the reconciliation is completed not more than 10 days after receipt. After  completion  of  actions  by  both  the  BCO  and  the  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity,  a  meeting  between  the  two  offices  will  be  held  to  assure  all  required  system inputs are  completed and the reconciliation  listings  are properly documented. To assure management personnel are aware of LRS/Materiel Management Activity and Contracting interface  problems,  the  results  of  the  local  purchase  reconciliation  process  will  be reviewed,  dated,  and  signed  by  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  Materiel Management Officer and the Chief, Management Analysis Flight in the Base Contracting Office.  (T-2).  Once  the  listing  is  signed  it  is  be  filed  and  any  previous  listings  may  be destroyed. 3.2.5.10.  Using  the  Integrated  Accounts  Payable  System  (IAPS)  Billed  Not  Received (BNR) Follow-up To Supply for Receiving Report. This report identifies items that have a vendor bill presented for payment, but the receipt has not processed by the ILS-S. Use this  listing  to  reconcile  vendor  bills  with  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  receiving records.  Local  purchase  items  will  appear  on  the  listing  7  days  after  the  vendor  bill  is received and processed in BCO. 3.2.5.10.1.  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  Processing  Actions.  The  Customer Support processes document number inquiries on all items. When the local purchase due-in  detail  is  on  file  in  the  ILS-S,  annotate  the  listing  with  the  current  status  and EDD.  When  a  Received  Not  Billed  (RNB)  detail  is  on  file  indicating  LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  receipt  processing,  annotate  the  listing  with  RNB  and  the DOLT  from  the  RNB  detail.  When  no  detail  exists  in  the  ILS-S  for  the  requisition document number, perform a transaction history from the current Julian date back to the  original  date  the  requisition  was  established.  Note:  Use  the  document  number date  in  most  cases  to  establish  the  date  of  requisition  creation.  When  the  local purchase due-in was previously canceled, annotate the listing with cancellation status and date. When the item was previously received, annotate the listing with the word “Received”  and  “Date.”  when  no  record  of  the  local  purchase  requisition  is  found AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 65 during  transaction  history  research,  annotate  the  listing  with  the  statement  “No Record of Due-In.” 3.2.6.  Local Purchase Open Item List. 3.2.6.1.  Purpose: For bases not supported by the SPS, the Local Purchase Open Item List provides a means to determine and/or verify the status of purchase orders with the BCO. For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use AFH 23-123. 3.2.6.2.  Bases  supported  by  the  SPS  may  eliminate  the  manual  Local  Purchase  Order File  in  Receiving.  SPS  supported  bases  are  not  required  to  complete  the  actions  in  the subparagraphs  listed  below;  however,  all  other  actions  are  required.  The  LRS  CC/AO may  assign  Customer  Support  Liaison  and  Funds  Management  responsibilities  listed below as deemed necessary to effectively and efficiently accomplish the tasks. 3.2.6.3.  Funds Management Actions. Funds Management will receive three copies of the Local  Purchase  Open  Item  List  and  send  one  copy  to  Receiving  and  one  copy  to Customer Support. 3.2.6.4.  Customer  Support  Liaison  Actions.  Within  10  workdays  of  receiving  the annotated list from Receiving, Stock Control completes the following actions: 3.2.6.4.1.  Obtain  Missing  DD  Form  1155,  Order  for  Supplies  or  Services  and  DD Form 1348-1A. If Receiving annotated the listing indicating missing DD Forms 1155 and 1348-1A, Customer Support will obtain the forms from Contracting and send to Receiving. 3.2.6.4.2.  Determine  Status  of  Unlisted  Purchase  Orders.  Customer  Support  will contact  Contracting  to  determine  the  status  of  unlisted  purchase  orders  on  the  open item  listing.  If  a  purchase  order  was  canceled,  Customer  Support  personnel  advises Receiving to close the file. Otherwise, Customer Support updates local purchase due-in and status detail records in the ILS-S. 3.2.6.4.3.  Screen BNR Details for Processing Errors. Customer Support ensures that BNR  detail  records  are  screened  against  the  document  files  and  transaction  history records. Customer Support  reconciles any corresponding due-out  detail  records with the customer if required and takes the appropriate actions to correct any errors. 3.2.6.4.4.  Process the Annotated Listing. The open item list is annotated with actions taken  and  one  copy  provided  to  Funds  Management.  Customer  Support  retains  one copy of the annotated listing to avoid duplicate research actions on the next listing. 3.2.6.5.  Final  Funds  Management  Actions.  After  receiving  the  annotated  list  from Customer Support, Funds Management performs the following actions: 3.2.6.5.1.  Check  Signed  Invoices.  Funds  Management  personnel  will  identify  BNR detail  records  which  Accounting  and  Finance  contains  a  signed  invoice.  Funds Management  will  initiate  action  with  the  appropriate  sections  to  ensure  a  receipt (REC) and request for special inventory (1GP) transactions are processed. The signed invoice  will  be  used  as  supporting  documentation  for  any  inventory  adjustment transaction processed. 66 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 3.2.6.5.2.  Check  for  Proof  of  Delivery.  Funds  Management  personnel  contacts Accounting  and  Finance  for  proof  of  delivery  for  each  BNR  detail  record.  Once obtained,  Funds  Management  forwards  proof  of  deliveries  to  Receiving  for  receipt transaction  (REC)  and  special  inventory  (1GP)  processing.  Funds  Management  will identify  which  BNR  detail  records  reflect  Records  Reversal  in  the  purchase  order number columns and determine why receipts were not reprocessed correctly. 3.2.7.  Other Local Purchase Management Reports and Notices. 3.2.7.1.  Purpose: The following paragraphs describe some of the other products that may be  used  to  ensure  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  and  contracting  requisition records match. Aside from the quarterly local purchase requisition reconciliation process, there are a number of other local purchase management reports and notices produced. For policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use  AFH 23-123. 3.2.7.2.  Holdover  listing.  Each  day,  SPS  produces  the  Holdover  Listing.  This  listing identifies supply local purchase requisitions “held over” because either the stock number and/or descriptive data are not loaded in the SPS system. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity should use this listing to identify items with status statements “NEW ITEM” and “NEW  PRI.”  These  status  statements  indicate  there  is  a  mismatch  between  contracting and the LRS/Materiel Management Activity records that must be corrected before further procurement action is taken. Coordinate with base contracting to determine the cause of the mismatch and provide the required data to correct the situation. 3.2.7.3.  Item  listing.  The  Item  Listing  is  printed  as  required.  This  listing  identifies  all stock numbers currently loaded in the SPS database. Note: The listing is printed in stock number,  part  number,  and  nomenclature  sequence.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  personnel  use  the  Item  Listing  to  research  part  numbers  for  local  purchase customer requests when the SPS system is not available. 3.2.7.4.  Error notices. SPS error notices are produced when an error condition is detected during  SPS  processing.  Error  notices  resulting  from  the  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity inputs are normally sent back to the ILS-S for correction. Supply will correct the error  and  then  return  the  error  notice  to  the  BCO  for  reprocessing.  Contact  Base Contracting for explanations of Supply error notices and associated corrective actions. 3.2.7.5.  Procurement notices. When supply requisition, status, and other transactions do not  meet  UMMIPS  standards,  the  SPS  system  creates  Procurement  Notices.  For  some Procurement  Notices,  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  may  have  to  correct  the specific problem. Contact Base Contracting for explanations of Procurement Notices and associated corrective actions. Section 3C—Receipt Processing 3.3.  Receipt Processing. 3.3.1.  Local Manufacture Receipts. 3.3.1.1.  Purpose: To explain the local manufacture receipt procedures process. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and additional information, AFI 24-203. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 67 3.3.1.2.  In order to reduce transportation and handling costs, LRS/Materiel Management Activity FSC will process receipts for local manufacture  items. (T-2). All other receipts should  be  processes  by  Distribution  personnel.  Materiel  Receipt  Acknowledgement Notice (DRA) is not produced for local manufacture (JBD) receipts. 3.3.1.3.  Upon  receipt  of  a  work  order  request  (DD  Form  1348-1A)  and  manufactured items received from a base maintenance activity, the following actions are performed: 3.3.1.3.1.  Receipts Due-In. Local manufacture receipts will be processed as receipts due-in. Ensure the form contains the requisition number assigned (See Sec. 5B, of this manual for procedures to establish a requisition number). 3.3.1.3.2.  Acknowledge  receipt  by  forwarding  a  receipted  copy  of  the  work  order request  to  the maintenance activity. The remaining copies of the work order request will be used as a receiving document. 3.3.1.3.3.  Process  the  receipt  transaction  in  the  ILS-S  (see  AFI  24-203  for  receipt format). 3.3.1.3.4.  Credit  Determination.  Credit  will  not  be  allowed  on  local  manufacture items unless they are a part of the SMAG (budget code 9). Contact Customer Support Section  to  determine  if  credit  is  allowed.  If  the  local  manufacture  receipts  are  for SMAG items, the receipts must contain a Y in position 45. The organization and shop code of the fabricating activity must appear in positions 46-50. The total cost (actual or  estimated)  of  all  items  used  to  fabricate  the  end  item  must  appear  on  the  receipt document.  The  total  cost  must  be  divided  by  the  number  of  units  to  obtain  the  cost which is also the input cost. Based on the input unit price, credit will be provided to the fabricating activity. The unit cost, not the total cost, is to be entered in positions 74-80 of the receipt input. 3.3.2.  Receipt Acknowledgement. 3.3.2.1.  Purpose: To describe the automated processes and transactions used by the ILSS to  acknowledge  receipt  processing  and  to  respond  to  follow-ups  from  wholesale activities.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 3.3.2.2.  The ILS-S acknowledges receipts with wholesale activities through two distinct automated methods. See Receipt Acknowledgement and Follow-Up in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for additional information on Receipt Acknowledgement. 68 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Chapter 4 MAKE AND MAINTAIN MATERIEL Section 4A—Overview 4.1.  Overview.  This  chapter  outlines  AF  guidance  to  complete  supply  chain  materiel management processes associated with the making and maintaining of materiel. These processes include  Time  Compliance  Technical  Order;  Repair  and  Time  Change  Items.  For  this  chapter, DoDM 4140.01, serves as a primary DoD reference source. Section 4B—Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) 4.2.  Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) 4.2.1.  TCTO Compliance. 4.2.1.1.  Purpose:  To  identify  assets  requiring  TCTO  compliance.  For  policy  specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 4.2.1.2.  Accurate management of Time Compliance Technical Order’s is key to upgrade of  end  items  such  as  aircraft,  missiles,  vehicles  and  equipment  used  to  support  these platforms. 4.2.1.3.  Items requiring TCTO compliance will be identified in one of two ways:  Items requiring modifications which change their form, fit, or function will be assigned NPPC 4.  Items  requiring  issue  to  Maintenance  for  modification  and  then  returned  under  the same stock number will be assigned the TCTO flag. 4.2.1.3.1.  Identified  during  receipt  processing.  When  receipts  are  processed  that requires TCTO compliance, the phrase “TCTO MODIFICATION REQUIRED” will be  printed  on  line  4  of  the  bin  notice.  Inspectors  determine  whether  the  TCTO  has been complied with,  if it has not,  an inspector issues the item  to  Maintenance using procedures outlined in Sec 5B, of this manual. 4.2.1.3.2.  Identified  on  Shipping  Document.  When  a  shipping  document  contains “TCTO MOD  REQ'D” in block 27 of the  DD  Form 1348-1A, or line 16 of the DD Form 1348-1A (computer generated) or the IT produced label, the inspector will take one of the following actions: 4.2.1.4.  Tag  all  items  in  storage  requiring  TCTO  modification  with  a  DD  Form  1576, Test/Modification Tag - Materiel, as specified in TO 00-20-3, Maintenance Processing of Reparable Property and the Repair Cycle Asset Control System. Pull modified assets (if they  are  available)  upon  receipt  of  an  issue  document  containing  the  phrase  "TCTO MODIFICATION  MAY  BE  REQUIRED."  Contact  the  customer  if  only  unmodified assets are available to see if an unmodified item is acceptable. 4.2.1.4.1.  When TCTO modification result in a change in the form, fit (specification of  size),  or  function,  the  item  will  be  reidentified  and  assigned  a  new  NSN.  The inspector loads a numeric parts preference code (NPPC) of 4 to the NSN. 4.2.1.4.1.1.  Assignment  and  Retention  of  NPPC  4.  NPPC  4  is  assigned  either AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 69 through  1)  the  AFMC  Interchangeability  and  Substitution  Edit  and  Suspense System (D043B) or 2) a Stock Control Data-Load/Change/Delete input found in Procedures  for  Stock  Control  Data  –  Load/Change/Delete  Input  (FCD)  in  AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 2. 4.2.1.4.1.2.  Conditions  Causing  the  Deletion  of  NPPC  4.  NPPC  4  is  normally retained  on  the  item  record  until  the  record  is  deleted.  The  following  conditions may cause deletion of the NPPC 4 from the item record before the item is deleted: 4.2.1.4.1.2.1.  AFMC  Cataloging  Transaction.  When  a  cataloging  transaction from  AFMC  removes  the  NPPC  4,  the  material  management  IT  system  will automatically  produce  a  TCTO  Code  management  notice  with  the  phrase “D043B  UPDATE”  in  the  remarks  field.  When  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  inspectors  believe  the  code  was  removed  in  error  and  the  item  in question meets the criteria for assigning the NPPC 4, they assign a TCTO flag and contact the applicable ALC Technical Service Branch. 4.2.1.4.1.2.1.1.  When  the  ALC  Technical  Service  Branch  determines  the item  requires  TCTO,  process  a  Stock  Control  Data  Input  to  load  NPPC  4 found in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8. 4.2.1.4.1.2.1.2.  When  the  ALC  Technical  Service  Branch  determines  the NPPC  4  is  not  applicable,  Stock  Control  will  delete  NPPC  4.  Inspection personnel ensure DD Form 1576 is removed from the item. 4.2.1.4.1.2.1.3.  Delete  the  TCTO  flag  once  the  ALC  Technical  Service Branch resolves the issue. 4.2.1.4.1.2.2.  Stock Control Data Input to change or delete NPPC 4. 4.2.1.4.1.2.3.  Conflict  with  AFMC  D043B.  If  the  NPPC  4  was  assigned locally with Stock Control Data Input but the AFMC D043B system does not yet contain the correct parts preference code, cataloging actions from D043B processing may remove the NPPC 4. When the NPPC 4 is removed, a TCTO Code management notice with the phrase “D043B UPDATE” in the remarks field will be produced. 4.2.1.4.1.2.3.1.  Inspection  personnel  may  contact  the  applicable  ALC Technical  Service  Branch  and/or  AFMC  and  provide  a  copy  of  the  TCTO for NSN requiring NPPC 4 cataloging activity. 4.2.1.4.1.2.3.2.  Inspection  personnel  will  load  the  TCTO  flag  to  the  item record of the item in question in order to maintain control of the item until the issue is resolved. 4.2.1.4.1.2.3.3.  Once  the  D043B  records  have  been  updated,  the  ILS-S automatically produces a TCTO Code management notice. 4.2.1.4.1.2.3.4.  Inspection personnel deletes the TCTO flag. 4.2.1.4.2.  Items requiring TCTO modification for reasons other than having changed in  form,  fit,  or  function  do  not  qualify  for  NPPC  4,  they  will  be  assigned  a  TCTO Flag using the Stock Control Data Input found in Loading, updating, and processing 70 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 NPPCs in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 to prevent issue of unmodified items. These items  are  issued  to  Maintenance  for  modification  and  then  returned  under  the  same stock number. 4.2.1.4.2.1.  Assignment  and  Retention  of  the  TCTO  Flag.  The  TCTO  flag  is assigned  through  the  Stock  Control  Data-Load/Change/Delete  input.  Retain  the TCTO flag on the applicable item records until the recession date of the TCTO. 4.2.1.5.  TCTO Code Management Notices. When an NPPC 4 is loaded to an item record a  TCTO  Code  management  notice  will  be  produced.  Upon  receipt  of  the  TCTO  Code management notice, the materiel management inspector determines the availability of the TCTO publication. 4.2.1.5.1.  Check  TCTO  Publication  Files.  If  the  TCTO  publication  is  already available in the Inspector’s TCTO publication file then appropriate procedures will be followed.  If  the  TCTO  publication  is  not  available,  contact  the  Maintenance  Plans Scheduling and Documentation to obtain the TCTO publication. 4.2.1.5.2.  TCTO  not  Available.  When  maintenance  has  no  record  of  the  TCTO publication  requiring  assignment  of  NPPC  4  to  the  item,  the  Inspector  must  contact HQ AFMC/LGSI to obtain the TCTO number. (T-2). When the Inspector obtains the TCTO  number,  immediately  provide  it  to  Base  Maintenance  Plans  Scheduling  and Documentation,  to  requisition  the  required  TCTO  publication.  Technical  data  may also  be  obtained  by  contacting the  applicable  ALC’s  Technical  Service Division/Branch. 4.2.1.6.  Control  of  Items  Requiring  TCTO  Kits.  Items  requiring  TCTO  kits  will  not  be issued  to  maintenance  for  modification  until  the  kits  are  available  and  maintenance  has requested them. When maintenance returns the modified item, enter the TCTO number in the remarks block of the DD Form 1574, Serviceable Tag. Annotate the form to indicate TCTO compliance. 4.2.1.7.  Monthly  Verification  of  TCTO  Items  On-the-Shelf.  Each  month  Inspection personnel  must  verify  stocked  items  assigned  either  NPPC  4  or  the  TCTO  flag  comply with  TCTOs.  (T-2)  Inspection  personnel  ensure  all  assets  are  inspected.  Outputs  or listings  should  be  produced  in  warehouse  and  detail  location  sequence  to  facilitate inspections. 4.2.1.8.  TCTO  Compliance  Undetermined.  When  the  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  Inspection  personnel  cannot  determine  if  an  item  complies  with  a  TCTO,  use activity code “C” to issue the item to Maintenance for inspection. Maintenance performs the necessary tests or inspections to determine if the item complies with the TCTO. 4.2.1.9.  If  the  item  does  not  comply  and  the  appropriate  TCTO  publication  is  not available  maintenance  requests  the  TCTO  publication.  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  Inspection  personnel  assigns  the  TCTO  flag  to  the  item  to  control  it  until Maintenance receives the TCTO/disposition instructions. Once Maintenance receives the TCTO publication, normal TCTO processing takes place. 4.2.1.9.1.  When  the  item  does  comply  with  the  TCTO,  ensure  it  is  tagged appropriately. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 71 4.2.2.  TCTO Kit Management. 4.2.2.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  TCTO  kit  management.  For  policy  specific  requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 4.2.2.2.  General procedures to identify TCTO kit management actions. 4.2.2.2.1.  Due-outs for TCTO kits are not released automatically. Receipt processing of TCTO kits produces a notice to stock and a TCTO availability notice. The notice indicates the total  on-hand balance and all existing due-out  detail  record. All  TCTO kits and all copies of the I029 management notice are forwarded to the LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  TCTO  Kit  Manager.  To  ensure  a  TCTO  asset  availability notice is produced, personnel will not enter a bypass due-out release TEX code on the receipt input. 4.2.2.2.2.  TCTO Kit Receipts 4.2.2.2.2.1.  Receiving  Base  Assembled  TCTO  Kits.  As  base  assembled  TCTO kits  are  completed,  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  TCTO  Kit  Manager prepares  a  receiving  document  on  DD  Form  1348-1A.  The  receiving  document will  include  routing  identifier  code  JBD  and  the  appropriate  due-in  requisition document number. The  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  TCTO  Kit  Manager signs the receiving document to indicate the TCN, NSN, and number of kits stated in  the  quantity  field  has  in  fact  been  completed.  Flight  Service  Center  picks up/signs for and processes all TCTO kits. 4.2.3.  TCTO Publications. 4.2.3.1.  Purpose: To explain the proper actions taken upon receipt of TCTO publications. For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use AFH 23-123. 4.2.3.2.  General procedures for handling TCTO publications. 4.2.3.2.1.  Maintenance Quality Assurance forwards a copy of all TCTO publications (except  for  munitions)  to  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  inspectors  and TCTO kit monitor. A copy is filed in the applicable TCTO kit jacket file and used to manage  items  in  stock  which  require  modification.  Maintain  TCTO  publications  in TCTO number sequence. 4.2.3.3.  The LRS/Materiel Management Activity Inspector accomplishes the following: 4.2.3.3.1.  Process Inquiry. Prepare an inquiry to list all item records, ISG related item records, and detail records for the listed stock numbers. 4.2.3.3.2.  Load NPPC 4 or TCTO Flag. Initiate action to load an NPPC 4 or TCTO Flag  to  the  item  record  of  the  item  to  be  modified.  Enter  the  TCTO  number  in  the source of restriction field (pos. 49-80) of the Stock Control Data-Load/Change/Delete input. 4.2.3.3.3.  Tag materiel awaiting TCTO modification with DD Form 1576 series. Use the  stock  number  or  part  number  physically  located  on  the  asset  as  the  source identification. 72 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 4.2.3.3.4.  Load suspect item flag to items assigned NPPC 4 or TCTO flag to ensure assets are properly inspected/tagged prior to releasing to stock or due-out release. 4.2.3.3.5.  Determine  Total  Kit  Requirement.  Determine  the  number  of  TCTO  kits needed  to  modify  base  stocks.  Take  inventory  of  all  unmodified  spares  on  hand, including serviceable, unserviceable, readiness spares packages, and supply points. 4.2.3.3.6.  Review of Due-Ins.  If the modification does NOT apply to  specific serial numbered  items,  then  due-in  quantities  that  have  been  shipped  or  released  for shipment  will  also  be  included  in  the  total  kit  requirement.  When  the  modification applies  to  specific  serially  numbered  items,  due-ins  are  not  considered  during  the review.  Requirements  for  serially  numbered  items  will  be  determined  upon  their receipt from the depot. 4.2.3.3.7.  Correspondence. Send correspondence to  forward supply points/locations, AC&W sites; relay sites, etc., when spares at those sites are to be modified. Forward the  TCTO  publication  and  a  cover  letter  to  these  forward  sites  for  their  evaluation. Route the correspondence for AC&W sites and radio relay sites through the EACC. 4.2.3.3.8.  When  the  host  base  provides  maintenance  support  for  the  forward  base, include the number of assets at the forward base requiring modification in the total kit requirements. 4.2.3.3.9.  When  compliance  cannot  be  made  at  the  forward  base,  the  forward  base requests replacement spares from the host base and returns unmodified spares to the host base for maintenance. The EACC coordinates the return of unmodified spares for AC&W  and  radio  relay  sites.  Send  unmodified  spares  to  Inspection,  who  then forwards them to maintenance for modification. 4.2.3.3.10.  Advising Maintenance. Upon completion of the above review, Inspection personnel  advises  the  appropriate  maintenance  activity  of  the  total  number  of  kits required to modify base stocks (and in transit items when applicable). 4.2.3.3.11.  Demand and Adjusted Stock Levels. When the technical order stipulates demand or adjusted stock levels be reduced or eliminated, advise the applicable Stock Control personnel to reduce or delete the adjusted stock level. 4.2.4.  Assembly of Kits. 4.2.4.1.  Purpose:  To  describe  the  base  assembly  of  TCTO  kits.  For  policy  specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 4.2.4.2.  General procedures to identify assembly of TCTO kits. 4.2.4.2.1.  The  TCTO  normally  indicates  how  the  TCTO  kit  is  to  be  assembled  and directions  for  obtaining  and  funding  the  kit.  Most  TCTO  kits  are  assembled  at  the wholesale  level  and  provided  free  of  charge  to  base  units.  However,  the  TCTO, AFMC, or HQ USAF may direct base assembly of TCTO kits. When base assembly is  directed  and  funds  will  be  provided,  the  base  will  track  expenditures  as  noted below. 4.2.4.2.2.  Billing  Base-Assembled  TCTO  Kits.  To  make  it  easier  to  bill  expenses incurred  for  the  base  assembly  of  TCTO  kits,  an  Organization  Cost  Center  Record AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 73 (OCCR)  and  Project  Funds  Management  Record  (PFMR)  are  loaded  for  each  kit and/or  source  of  funds  (such  as  OBAN,  ALC,  MAJCOM,  etc.).  Accounting  and Finance  (A&F)  will  load  the  PFMR,  as  specified  by  DFAS-DE  7077.10-M.  The LRS/Materiel Management Activity will load the OCCR using an organization code in  the  100-999  series  and  type  organization  code  3  as  outlined  Sec.  8B.  The responsibility  center/cost  center  code  will  be  99xxxx,  as  provided  by  A&F.  Upon receiving  authority  to  assemble  a  kit  at  base  level,  the  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  TCTO  Kit  Monitor  furnishes  A&F  the  TCTO  kit  number,  the  appropriate funding source, and the A&F disbursing station number. 4.2.4.2.3.  Inclusion  of  Unauthorized  Materiel  in  TCTO  Kits.  When  a  modification requires  materiel  not  authorized  for  inclusion  in  the  kit,  such  as  explosives, munitions, or medical items, the IM/SM responsible for the modification will provide appropriate funding for the required materiel to the activity developing or assembling the kit. Base funds will not be provided to buy items not normally included in TCTO kits. The costs for these items are included in the base's operating budget. The activity will  then  obtain  the  required  materiel.  All  such  items  will  be  kitted  separately  and identified as part of the total TCTO kit so proper storage and safety measures can be taken. 4.2.4.2.4.  Deviations from the Complete Kit Policy. Deviations from the complete kit policy  require  waivers  agreed  to  by  the  MAJCOM.  Base  level  will  accept  the financial and manpower burden upon acceptance of a deviation from the complete kit. (T-1). Host command LRS/Materiel Management activities accepts the responsibility for kit buildup of incomplete TCTO kits waived by a tenant unit's MAJCOM. Items excluded  from  TCTO  kits  by  waiver  are  acquired  from  existing  organizational resources or purchased through regular supply channels. When the need is urgent and the  using  command  has  adequate  materiel  assets  at  another  location,  they  will redistribute the materiel laterally to complete their TCTO kits. 4.2.5.  Establishment and Maintenance of TCTO Kit Files. 4.2.5.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  establishment  and  maintenance  of  the  TCTO  kit  files. For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use AFH 23-123. 4.2.5.2.  General procedures for filing completed TCTO kit files. 4.2.5.2.1.  Establishment  and  maintenance  of  TCTO  Kit  Files  will  be  accomplished IAW AFI 23-101, Sec. 4B. (T-1) 4.2.5.3.  Completed TCTO Kit Files. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity TCTO Kit Monitor  places  the  TCTO  Kit  file  in  the  completed  file  when  all  balances  have  been reduced to zero and no requirements exist. The completed jacket file will be retained as specified in the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule. (T-2). 4.2.6.  Establishment of TCTO Kit Item Records. 4.2.6.1.  Purpose:  To  identify  procedures  to  establish  the  TCTO  Kit  item  records.  For policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use  AFH 23-123. 74 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 4.2.6.2.  General procedures governing TCTO Kit item records loads. 4.2.6.2.1.  Establishment  of  TCTO  Kit  Item  Records.  If  a  new  TCTO  is  required Maintenance  coordinates  with  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  TCTO  Kit Monitor to request Records Maintenance to load the item record. The item record will be assigned ERRCD XD2 and the appropriate Routing Identifier Code. 4.2.6.2.2.  Recoverable  Assembly  Management  Process  System  (RAMP)  Reporting. All TCTO kits assigned a depot RIC (e.g., FHZ, FLZ, F77, etc.) are included in the daily RAMP reports and are subject to depot management or redistribution. 4.2.7.  Identification of TCTO Kit Requirements. 4.2.7.1.  Purpose:  To  identify  items  requiring  TCTO  compliance.  For  policy  specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 4.2.7.2.  General procedures to identify TCTO requirements. 4.2.7.2.1.  Identification  of  TCTO  Kit  Requirements.  Maintenance  activities  review incoming  technical  publications  to  determine  the  number  of  TCTO  kits  required. Usually, only one kit for each aircraft, missile, end item of equipment, spare part or component to be modified is authorized. The maintenance activity sends a copy of the technical  order  to  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  inspection  personnel  to determine kit requirements for items in stock (and in transit when applicable). 4.2.8.  Releasing TCTO Kits to Maintenance. 4.2.8.1.  Purpose:  To  identify  procedures  for  Releasing  TCTO  Kits  to  maintenance.  For policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use  AFH 23-123. 4.2.8.2.  TCTO kits are ordered through the TCTO Kit Monitor. When complete kits are available for release to the user, the TCTO Kit Monitor processes a DOR at which time the TCTO kit may be distributed. 4.2.8.2.1.  Releasing  TCTO  Kits  to  maintenance.  When  TCTO  kits  are  required,  the following actions are accomplished: 4.2.8.2.1.1.  The  maintenance  activity  furnishes  the  TCTO  Kit  Monitor  with  a Maintenance  IT  system  report  listing  specifying  the  technical  order  number  and the  serial  number  of  the  end  item  listed  on  the  AF  Form  2001,  Notification  of TCTO  Kit  Requirements.  The  TCTO  Kit  Monitor  processes  a  force  due-out release  to  the  applicable  due-out  listed  in  the  TCTO  Jacket  File  using  the procedures outlined in Sec. 5B, of this publication. 4.2.8.2.1.2.  When  a  consolidated  issue  request  has  been  used,  the  TCTO  kit monitor  enters  the  quantity  to  be  released  and  verifies  the  completeness  of available kits (all components may not be available). 4.2.8.2.1.3.  When complete kits are available, the TCTO kit monitor prepares and processes a forced DOR using the procedures outlined in Chapter 5. 4.2.8.2.1.4.  When complete kits are not available, the TCTO kit monitor advises maintenance  of  the  current  supply  status  of  the  items  still  required.  The AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 75 incomplete kits may be released at the option of the maintenance activity. 4.2.8.2.1.5.  The TCTO Kit Monitor enters the date of release for each TCTO kit on the AF Form 2001. 4.2.8.2.2.  Free  Issue  of  TCTO  Kits.  Modification-driven  TCTO  kits  will  be  free issued. Only  one kit per asset requiring modification will be funded. When in-stock assets (RSP, POS, Supply Points, etc.) require modification, the asset will  be issued using  activity  code  “C”  to  the  appropriate  repair  shop,  and  one  TCTO  kit  for  each asset  requiring  modification  will  be  free  issued  to  the  appropriate  repair  shop  as outlined in Sec. 5B, of this publication. 4.2.8.2.3.  Exceptions.  Non-modification  driven  TCTO  kits  and  replacement  kits  or components  for  assets  which  are  lost  or  used  for  purposes  other  than  modification must be purchased using the organization's O&M funds unless type organization code 3 is used. 4.2.9.  Storage and Control of TCTO Kits. 4.2.9.1.  Purpose:  To  describe  the  proper  storage  and  control  of  TCTO  kits.  For  policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 4.2.9.2.  General procedures to establish controls to prevent the loss or unauthorized use of kits and their components. 4.2.9.2.1.  Shelf Life Monitoring. TCTO kits may contain shelf life items so each kit is inspected to be certain the shelf life items listed in the TCTO bill of materials are still serviceable. The TCTO Kit  Monitor uses kit stock numbers to  control  the shelf life  items  in  the  kits.  When  items  become  outdated,  normal  shelf  life  control procedures  will  apply.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  TCTO  Kit  Monitor tags  kits  containing  outdated  items  with  condition  code  E  (limited  restoration).  The kits remain in this status until the outdated items have been replaced or shelf life has been extended. 4.2.9.2.1.1.  Type I items are replaced through normal requisitioning procedures. 4.2.9.2.1.2.  The  Inspector  will  examine  type  II  items  and  update  the  DD  Forms 1574,  1574-1,  or  DD  Form  2477  on  the  containers.  When  the  inspection  is completed and/or when the outdated materiel is replaced, the kit will be assigned the appropriate supply condition code (A, B, or C). 4.2.9.2.2.  Items needing repair. TCTO kits found to contain items needing repair will be  tagged  condition  code  G  (incomplete)  by  an  authorized  Inspector.  The  reparable items  will  be  tagged  condition  code  F  (reparable)  and  turned  in  for  repair.  The LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  Inspector  will  notify the  LRS/Materiel Management Activity TCTO Kit Monitor immediately to requisition replacements to return the kits to complete (issuable) status. (T-2). 4.2.10.  Transferring TCTO Kits. 4.2.10.1.  Purpose: To describe procedures for transferring TCTO kits. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 4.2.10.2.  General procedures to describe actions to transfer TCTO kits. 76 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 4.2.10.2.1.  Transferring  TCTO  Kits.  Maintenance  Plans,  Scheduling  and Documentation  (PS&D)  advises  the  TCTO  Kit  Monitor  of  impending  transfers  of aircraft or end items.  This notice should be issued as far in advance of the transfers as possible in order to ship applicable TCTO kits with the aircraft or end items. 4.2.10.2.2.  PS&D  provides  identification  data,  including  date  of  transfer,  specific TCTO number involved, destination base, type, and tail or identification number. 4.2.10.2.3.  The  TCTO  kit  monitor  determines:1)  the  availability  of  the  kits designated  for  transfer,  and  2)  the  weight  and  cube  of  those  kits  (by  estimation  if exact figures are not available). 4.2.10.2.4.  The TCTO kit monitor prepares a degraded operations shipping document and Nondirected Shipment  Transaction input for  each kit being shipped,  as outlined in Sec. 2B. The type of aircraft, end item of equipment, or tail identification number will  be  entered  in  Block  V  of  the  shipping  document.  The  TCTO  kit  monitor coordinates  with  the  LRS/Transportation  activity  to  establish  the  date  the  kits  and shipping documents should  be forwarded. After  the  LRS/Transportation  activity has received  and  signed  for  the  kits,  the  Nondirected  Shipment  Transaction  input  and document  file  copies  will  be  processed.  Upon  shipment  of  the  kits  the  TCTO  kit monitor cancels all TCTO kit Due-Outs and Due-Ins for the transferred aircraft or end items,  and,  when  applicable,  annotates  AF  Form  2001  to  show  the  cancellation  and shipment. 4.2.10.2.5.  Once  the  TCTO  kit  monitor  has  completed  the  shipment,  it  advises  the consignee  (ship-to  SRAN)  LRS  CC/AO  by  message  that  the  TCTO  kits  are  being shipped  with  the  transferred  aircraft  or  end  items  of  equipment.  This  message  will include  the  TCTO  kit  stock  number,  technical  order  number,  quantity,  shipping document  number,  type  of  aircraft  or  end  item,  tail  or  identification  number,  and mode of shipment. 4.2.10.2.6.  When the TCTO kit monitor at the consignee (ship-to SRAN) receives the shipping  notice,  and  work  closely  with  the  PS&D  and  the  Materiel  Management Flight, Vehicle Operations Element to make sure that all kits arriving with the aircraft or end items are delivered to the LRS, Inbound Cargo. The TCTO kit monitor and the PS&D  ensure  that  all  outstanding  kit  requirements  for  the  new  aircraft  and/or  end items are properly recorded on AF Form 2001 and incorporated into the base TCTO kit system. When requested by PS&D, the TCTO kit monitor adds the new aircraft, end  item,  or  identification  number  to  any  existing  AF  Form  2001.  The  PS&D prepares and processes a new AF Form 2001 if required by an outstanding TCTO. 4.2.11.  TCTO Kit Reconciliation and Status Report. 4.2.11.1.  Purpose:  To  describe  procedures  for  TCTO  kit  reconciliation  and  status reporting.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 4.2.11.2.  General  procedures  to  describe  steps  taken  for  TCTO  kit  reconciliation  and status reporting. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 77 4.2.11.2.1.  TCTO  Kit  Reconciliation  and  Status  Report.  The  LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  and  Maintenance  reconcile  all  TCTO  kit  assets  and requirements monthly  IAW AFI 21-101.  (T-2). The purpose of this reconciliation is to validate kit availability, shortages, excesses, due-outs, and due-ins. 4.2.11.2.1.1.  Local  Program.  Bases  will  process  a  locally  developed  program  or an as-required report (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 16 and AFH 23-123, Vol 2,  Pt  4,  Ch  4)  to  obtain  reconciliation  data  from  applicable  ILS-S  database records. (T-2).  The program should list data from the item record, due-out detail, due-in and status detail records. For example: 4.2.11.2.1.1.1.  Item  Record  (technical  order  number  obtained  from  item record  nomenclature  field;  TCTO  kit  stock  number,  on-hand  serviceable balance; routing identifier code; and the unit cost). 4.2.11.2.1.1.2.  Due-out  Detail  Record  (due-out  document  number;  due-out mark for field; quantity due-out; urgency justification code). 4.2.11.2.1.1.3.  Due-in and Status Detail Records. 4.2.11.2.2.  Actions. The following actions are necessary: 4.2.11.2.2.1.  Maintenance advises the TCTO Kit Monitor of all excesses found in the reconciliation. 4.2.11.2.2.2.  Maintenance advises the TCTO Kit Monitor of tail number changes required  in  existing  due-outs  and  of  additional  requirements  not  stated  in  the Reconciliation Listing. 4.2.11.2.2.3.  The  TCTO  Kit  Monitor  ensures  all  changes  requested  by Maintenance are processed. 4.2.11.2.3.  An  actual  face  to  face  meeting  will  be  held.  The  Materiel  Management Officer  determines  attendance for  LRS/Materiel  Management personnel. MX Plans, Scheduling and Documentation will chair the meeting. requirements 4.2.11.2.3.1.  Both  the  Materiel  Management  Officer  and  the  Maintenance Control Officer must sign the TCTO Reconciliation Listing. (T-2). 4.2.11.2.3.2.  The  chair  prepares  the  minutes  and  distributes  them  to  the  MX Group  Commander  and  the  LRS  CC/AO  within  5  working  days.  Both LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  and  maintenance  TCTO  monitors  will  use the minutes or the Reconciliation Listing to administer the TCTO program. (T-2). 4.2.11.2.4.  Reporting  of  Excess  Kits.  Report  excess  kits  to  the  IM  by  e-mail.  IMs provide  disposition  instructions  for  excess  kits.  At  the  option  of  the  MAJCOM, excess  locally  manufactured  kits  with  routing  identifier  JBD  are  reported  to  a command  redistribution  system  for  disposition instructions.  If  a  command redistribution system does not exist then Maintenance disassembles all excess locally assembled  kits  having  routing  identifier  code  JBD  and  return  the  components  to stock. 4.2.12.  Redistribution/Disassembly of TCTO Kits. 78 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 4.2.12.1.  Purpose:  To  describe  procedures  for  the  redistribution  and/or  disassembly  of TCTO  Kits.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 4.2.12.2.  General  procedures  to  describe  actions  taken  to  redistribute  or  disassemble TCTO kits. 4.2.12.2.1.  Redistribution/Disassembly of TCTO Kits. IMs use Redistribution Orders (RDO)  to  direct  redistribution  or  disassembly  of  excess  centrally  managed  TCTO kits; those with a routing identifier code (RIC) other than JBD. 4.2.12.2.1.1.  RDOs directing disassembly contain the constants YBRKDN in the supplementary address field. 4.2.12.2.1.2.  In lieu of disassembly, MAJCOMs  may  use non-directed shipment requests (SHP) to redistribute locally assembled kits with RIC of JBD. 4.2.12.2.1.3.  When kits are to be disassembled: 4.2.12.2.1.3.1.  The TCTO kit monitor will issue the kits to Maintenance.  (T-2). 4.2.12.2.1.3.2.  Upon disassembly of the kits, all components are to be turned in to base stocks. 4.2.12.2.1.3.3.  The  TCTO  kit  monitor  works  closely  with  the  appropriate Maintenance  Materiel  Control  to  ensure  that  all  documents  for  turned-in, removed, or replaced parts are properly marked and controlled throughout the redistribution process. 4.2.13.  Re-Identification and Stock List Changes. 4.2.13.1.  Purpose: To describe procedures for the re-identification and stock list changes of assets after modification. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 4.2.13.2.  General  procedures  to  identify  steps  taken  when  an  asset  is  modified  due  to TCTO compliance. 4.2.13.2.1.  When  a  TCTO  affects  parts,  subassemblies,  assemblies,  or  complete articles  to  the  extent  that  physical  modification  of  the  part  is  required,  a  new  part number will be assigned and the national stock number (NSN) will be changed. When the TCTO requires a condition inspection to identify defects which will be corrected through  the  replacement  of  a  like  new  item,  no  NSN  or  part  number  change  is required. 4.2.13.3.  When retrofit changes are made that result in new parts, parts being modified, or changes in installation and assembly of new parts, new drawings shall be prepared or existing  drawings  revised  to  include  new  part  numbers,  as  applicable,  (MIL-T-31000, Government/DoD Engineering Drawing Practices Technical Data Package) to reflect the retrofit change being performed. 4.2.13.4.  When  a  part  number  and/or  NSN  are  stamped,  etched,  stenciled,  brazed,  etc., on the article being modified, removal or change to re-identify the modified article with AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 79 the  appropriate  new  part  number  and/or  NSN  will  be  accomplished  (MIL-STD-130, Identification Marking of U.S. Military Property). (T-1). 4.2.13.5.  When an item is altered according to an engineering change or a TCTO change, new or revised drawings will be required. 4.2.13.6.  Item  interchangeability  and  substitution  (I&S)  relationships  are  updated  and changes reflected in records and through revised I&S group stock list publications. 4.2.13.7.  End  article  IMs  issuing  TCTOs  notifies  the  applicable  cataloging  activity  to have expedited change actions initiated. Prompt re-identification changes in the next AF stock list change or AF service supplement change cycles, and any changes to the MCR-1 publication  file  will  be  accomplished.  It  is  the  intent  to  issue  the  applicable  stock  list change notice concurrently with release of the routine TCTO. 4.2.13.8.  Upon  determining  applicability  of  the  TCTO,  the  Maintenance  Plans, Scheduling  and  Documentation  Section  immediately  furnishes  an  action  copy  of  the TCTO  to  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity.  The  LRS  CC/AO  uses  the  published TCTO as authority to freeze item records and warehouse bins, challenge all requisitions for  validity  of  end  item  application  as  a  controlled  exception,  and  apply  management codes as required IAW this chapter. 4.2.14.  Management Coding On Supply Records. 4.2.14.1.  Purpose: To describe procedures for the management coding on supply records. For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use AFH 23-123 4.2.14.2.  General procedures to outline coding on Supply Records for TCTO kits. 4.2.14.2.1.  All  TCTO  kits  will  be  assigned  manager  review  code  "L"  per  AFMC guidance.  This  degree  of  management  gives  visibility  of  transactions  and  requires positive  manager  action  before  any  shipments  are  made.  This  control  is  required  to insure  that  kits  are  not  used  for  unauthorized  requirements.  The  visibility  of  actions assists  the  Technical  Content  Manager  (TCM)  in  the  release  of  backorders  to maintain  the  TCTO  schedule.  IMs  coordinate  with  applicable  MAJCOM  TCTO  Kit Manager(s)  prior  to  force  release  actions  to  ship  kits.  The  TCM(s)  documents coordination actions in the TCTO kit management files. 4.2.14.3.  All  items/spares  affected  by  TCTOs  that  jeopardize  life,  safety  of  flight,  and condemnation/mutilation will be assigned manager review code "T" per AFMC guidance. This degree of management gives visibility of transactions and requires positive manager action  before  any  shipments  are  made.  This  control  is  required  to  prevent  wrong spares/items from being issued to a user and to insure that critical parts affecting safety that  have  been  removed  by  a  TCTO  are  not  reissued  to  maintenance  for  the  same application. Manager review codes are assigned to those affected items immediately upon receipt  and  processing  of  AFMC  Form  874,  Time  Compliance  Technical  Order  Supply Data Requirements,  and  AFMC Form 172,  Coordination of Proposed Technical Order, and the manager review code will remain in place during the life of the TCTO. 4.2.14.4.  Items identified for removal and mutilated to prevent inadvertent reinstallation are processed as follows: 80 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 4.2.14.4.1.  Assign manager review code "T." 4.2.14.4.2.  Determine  approximate  number  of  items  in  the  ILS-S  and  prepare  an AFMC  Form  206  Temporary  Work  Request  to  have  these  items  mutilated  and/or salvaged.

MAJCOMs  may  establish  CRFs  based  on  concepts  outlined  in  AFI  20-117, Repair  Network  Integration,  and  AFMAN  20-118,  Repair  Network  Integration Operations.  These  procedures  apply  to  Air  Force  repair  activities  supported  by  or designated to operate under the Enterprise CRF concept. 4.3.12.2.  ILS-S  Records  at  CRF  Supported  LRS  Bases.  The  LRS  activity  at  the  CRF location  conducting  intermediate  repair  is  identified  as  the  “CRF  Host  LRS”.  Bases required  to  ship  to  a  CRF  for  intermediate  repair  support  are  identified  as  “CRF-supported units” 4.3.12.3.  The  ILS-S  capability  to  manage  CRF’s  coupled  with  changes  made  by  HQ AFMC  Execution  and  Prioritization  of  Repair  Support  System  (EXPRESS)  allow  an Enterprise management of repair actions. 4.3.12.4.  The  Repair  Destinations  capability  uses  a  daily  EXPRESS  data  file  to  update ILS-S reparable shipment destinations. When updates are not correctly reflected in SBSS, bases will ship reparable carcasses to the incorrect repair location. 4.3.13.  AFMC will: 4.3.13.1.  Load  applicable  support  records,  determine  appropriate  shipment  guidance, shipping  destination,  routing  identifier,  and  RIC  as  well  as  provide  supplemental instructions to units/MAJCOMs as necessary. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 89 4.3.13.2.

This  chapter  outlines  AF  guidance  to  accomplish  supply  chain  materiel management  processes  associated  with  the  delivery  of  materiel.  These  processes  include  Order and  Requisitioning;  Physical  Asset  Management;  Equipment  Management;  Document  Control and  Detail  Records,  Record  Reversal  and  Correction,  Physical  Inventory  and  Inventory Adjustments;  SPRAM;  Inspection  and  Related  Operations;  and  Materiel  Disposition  in  DLM 4000.25-1, Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP); DLM 4000.25-2, Military Standard Transaction Reporting and Accountability Procedures (MILSTRAP); DLM 4000.25-6,  Department  of  Defense  Activity  Address  Directory  (DoDAAD)  (Activity  Address Code Sequence); DoDM 4140.01, and DoD 4140.27-M are reference sources for this chapter. Section 5B—Ordering and Requisitioning 5.2.  Ordering and Requisitioning. 5.2.1.  Customer Issue Request and Processing. 5.2.1.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  customer  issue  request  procedures  process.  For  policy specific requirements, review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.2.1.2.  General  Discussion:  Most  maintenance  issue  requests  are  processed  directly from an external maintenance IT system (i.e., IMDS and G081). Processing instructions for those systems can be found in the applicable system handbooks. Customers requiring the LRS/Materiel Management Activity to directly input issue requests in the ILS-S will submit  issue  requests  to  the  Customer  Support.  Various  forms  used  to  submit  customer requests  for  materiel  include:  AF  Form  2005;  DD  Form  1348-6;  AF  Form  601, Equipment  Action  Request;  and  AF  Form  1445,  Materials  and  Equipment  List.  Under certain  circumstances,  spreadsheets  may  be  more  practical  than  individual  AF  Forms 2005. All processing requirements that apply to the AF Form 2005 equally apply to the spreadsheet. Note: For special type items and conditions, follow these procedures and the applicable steps identified in Chapter 5. 5.2.1.3.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  will  take  the  following  actions  for customer issue requests: 5.2.1.3.1.  Process  customer  request  IAW  with  Expendable  Item  Customer  Issue Request (ISU) Transaction Format and Documentation Requirements in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.

When  an  asset  issued,  ensure  transaction  output  processed  to  the applicable warehouse. 5.2.1.3.4.2.  When  a  transaction  rejected,  see  316  REJ  Authority  For  Issue  Flag Blank or  Invalid in  AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt  2, Ch 7 for corrective action and re-input transaction. 5.2.2.  Customer Issue Request and Processing of Special Type Items and Conditions. 5.2.2.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  how  to  prepare  and  process  customer  issue  requests  for special  type  items  and  conditions.  For  policy  specific  requirements,  review  AFI  23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.2.2.2.  General Discussion: There are numerous categories of items  and circumstances where  normal  (automated)  ILS-S  issue  procedures  do  not  apply.  Examples  include: reduced  price  items;  health  hazard  items;  forms;  local  manufacture  items;  non-stock listed items; and rubber stamps that require special issue procedures. Also, under certain circumstances,  customers  may  request  issue  of  unserviceable  items  managed  on  ILS-S unserviceable  detail  (R920)  records.  When  requested,  special  issue  procedures  and coding are required. 5.2.2.3.  Transient Aircraft Item Issues. 5.2.2.3.1.  Foreign  Government  Aircraft.  Foreign  Governments  must  have  an  ACSA in  place  before  any  exchange  can  occur.  Obtain  approval  to  provide  supply  assets according to AFI 25-301, Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements. 5.2.2.3.1.1.  When  ACSA  transactions  are  approved  by  the  MAJCOM  ACSA AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 93 manager  or  delegated  authority  IAW  AFI  25-301,  this  section  provides  materiel management procedures for international cross-servicing of Not Mission Capable (NMC)  aircraft  using  Acquisition  and  Cross  Servicing  Agreement  (ACSA) authority. Supply assets can be sold and exchanged using ACSA authority. Under ACSA,  logistic  support  exchanges  are  voluntary  and  at  the  discretion  of  the MAJCOM  and  installation/unit  providing  or  receiving  support.  Each  request  is considered  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  evaluated  for  legal  authority,  capability  to support,  and  the  supporting  entity’s  mission  impact  if  the  request  is  supported. ACSA  Global  Automated  Tracking  and  Reporting  System  (AGATRS)  will  be used by all AF units, as directed by MAJCOM IAW AFI 25-301. 5.2.2.3.1.2.  MAJCOMs may delegate ACSA exchange approval authority to local commanders. 5.2.2.3.1.3.  MAJCOM  or  Higher  HQ  ACSA  manager,  in  coordination  with  the providing unit(s) will ensure: 5.2.2.3.1.3.1.  The requesting nation is ACSA eligible. 5.2.2.3.1.3.2.  The  asset  being  provided  or  exchanged  is  authorized  under ACSA authority. 5.2.2.3.1.3.3.  Negative mission impacts of providing support are minimal. 5.2.2.3.1.4.  Initial  Issue  of  Depot  Level  Repair  assets  (DLR)  in  support  of  Cost Per  Flying  Hour  (CPFH)  need  to  follow  the  approving  authority  as  outlined  in AFI 23-101 and AFMAN 23-122. 5.2.2.3.1.4.1.  Form  1-3a,  Acquisition  and  Cross-Servicing  Agreement (ACSA)/Mutual  Logistics  Support  (MLS)  Order  Form,  produced  in  ACSA Global  Automated  Tracking  and  Reporting  System  (AGATRS)  is  the  DoD standard and will be used by AF Forces, IAW 25-301. 5.2.2.3.1.5.  ACSA repayment method from the receiving nation is accomplished through  Replacement-In-Kind  (RIK)  or  Cash  reimbursement.  The  selection  of repayment will be indicated on the completed ACSA MLS order form. 5.2.2.3.1.6.  Use reimbursements the following  procedures to issue  spares  and receive 5.2.2.3.1.6.1.  The applicable maintenance organization will order the part on their  supply  organization  account  with  shop  code  TA.  (T-1).  When  the requirement  is  loaded  in  a  Maintenance  Information  System  (MIS)  with  a valid  job  control  number  (JCN),  requisitions  will  be  processed  in  the appropriate  MIS  with  an  activity  code  “J”  document  number.  When  there  is no  MIS,  the  requisition  will  be  processed  directly  with  the  LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  using  the  ILS-S  under  an  activity  code  “X”  document number. 5.2.2.3.1.6.2.

The  customer  determines  if  unmodified assets  may  be  used,  or  if  TCTO  kits  are  available  for  modification.  This action is  performed by  contacting the TCTO kit manager for review of the modification  technical  order  (for  applicability  by  end-item  model  number, completion dates, etc.) and kit availability. 5.2.2.3.2.2.2.2.  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  Actions.  Customer Support  personnel  processes  TCTO  item  issue  requests  with  materiel condition code D if unmodified assets may be used. The Inspection function works  with  the  responsible  maintenance  activity  for  item  modification  if needed  when  TCTO  kits  are  available.  Customer  Support  works  with  the base TCTO kit manager to determine the type of LRS/Materiel Management Activity action required to satisfy the issue request when TCTO kits are not available. 5.2.2.3.3.  Nuclear  Weapons  Related  Materiel  (NWRM)  Issues.  All  NWRM  issue requests  will  comply  with  AFI  20-110,  Nuclear  Weapons-Related  Materiel Management. (T-1). 5.2.2.3.3.1.  The Customer Support/After Hours support will: 5.2.2.3.3.1.1.  Review  the  current  NWRM  authorization  list  to  ensure  the individual and/or organization ordering the asset is a valid recipient. (T-2). 5.2.2.3.3.1.2.  Provide the NWRM Transaction Control Center (NTCC) NSN, part  number,  issue  document  number,  quantity,  unit  of  issue,  and  applicable serial number(s) of the assets. (T-2). The NTCC will lift freeze code “N” via Freeze  Code  Update  processing,  and  notify  the  requesting  LRS/Materiel Management Activity that the freeze code has been removed. 5.2.2.3.3.1.3.  When an asset is  available, process  the issue request  with  IEX D.  After  successful  processing,  contact  the  NTCC  to  reload  the  freeze  code “N”. 5.2.2.3.3.1.4.  When  an  asset  is  not  available:  process  the  backorder,  contact NTCC to process a requisition and reload the freeze code “N”. 5.2.2.3.4.  Continuous  Length  Items.  When  the  issue  request  is  for  one  continuous length  of  an  item,  assign  requisition  advice  code  2N  to  the  issue  request.  Customer Support personnel will query the ILS-S to see if the item record serviceable balance is equal  to  or  greater  than  the  input  issue  request  quantity  and  process  the  request  as follows: 5.2.2.3.4.1.  Sufficient Continuous Length. When the quantity on hand in the ILS-S is equal to or greater than the input issue quantity, Customer Support personnel will  contact  warehouse  personnel  to  verify  that  the  quantity  required  is  in  one continuous length. Customer Support personnel will process the issue transaction with the quantity requested. 5.2.2.3.4.2.  Insufficient  Continuous  Length.  When  the  quantity  is  less  than requested, or not in a continuous length, process the issue transaction with TEX 8 to bypass on-hand stock and requisition the appropriate continuous length. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 97 5.2.2.3.5.

Items assigned a local  unit of issue are identified by  a dash one (-1) in  positions 14 and 15 of the stock number.  Items are normally  assigned a local  unit of issue when the  basic  stock  number  is  purchased  using  a  different  unit  of  issue  than  customers require upon issue. For example, a basic stock number is ordered with a unit of issue of box (BX). Customers only require issues of one (1) each (EA). In this situation, a (-1) stock number would be established to allow issues of one each. 5.2.2.3.24.1.  Requisitioning  dash  one  (-1)  stock  numbers.  Requisition  (A0*) transactions  should  not  be  produced  for  -1  stock  numbers.  Depot  cancellation action  will  occur  if  a  -1  stock  number  is  requisitioned  to  the  source  of  supply. Therefore,  ensure  that  all  replenishment  requisitions  are  produced  for  the  basic stock  number  only.  The  -1  requirement  can  only  be  filled  from  the  on-hand balance of the basic stock number. 5.2.2.3.24.2.  Adjust demand data. Do not reduce the demand data on the -1 stock number unless a lower demand-based stock level is desired. Demand data must be retained  to  ensure  a  demand-based  stock  level  is  computed  as  required.  Note: AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 105 Demand  data  will  be  adjusted  automatically  when  the  ILS-S  S01  program  is processed. 5.2.2.3.25.  Items  Under  Integrated  Management.  Items  are  placed  under  integrated management  to  alleviate  problems  incurred  in  forecasting  unusual  requirements  for individual  items  required  to  support  special  programs  or  projects.  These  are  non-repetitive  in  nature  and  cannot  be  predicted  through  the  use  of  demand  history  or available  program  data.  Additionally,  these  items  have  the  greatest  probability  of materializing and resulting in the eventual submission of requisitions. This procedure is applicable to AFMC Air Logistics Complexes, AFMC base support activities, and AF  base  level  activities  who  become  involved  in  these  types  of  programs. Compliance with these procedures permit a greater degree of responsive support for planned  projects  and  programs,  and  can  improve  ICP  effectiveness  and  enhance customer support. 5.2.2.3.25.1.  Items under integrated management are requisitioned as follows: 5.2.2.3.25.1.1.  Process  a  special  requisition  transaction  to  load  the  due-in detail. Demand Code P (Special Programs – Nonrecurring) will be used on the special requisition transaction format. 5.2.2.3.25.1.2.  Prevent  due-in  cancellation.  Either  establish  a  due-out  or  be sure  the  special  requirement  indicator  (SRI)  R  is  used  on  the  special requisition  transaction.  Note:  The  SRI  R  appears  on  the  due-in  detail.   Due-out  detail  or  due-in  details  containing  SRI  R  will  prevent  the  ILS-S  from requesting cancellation on these requisitions. 5.2.2.3.26.  Lumber  and  Other  Wood  Products.  Lumber  and  other  wood  products coded for requisitioning from the DLA Land and Maritime may be locally purchased if the total value of the requisition is $2,500 or less. Note: There is no set dollar limit on lumber and other wood products coded for local purchase. For emergency lumber requirements not available locally, regardless of price, are processed dependent upon the FSC. 5.2.2.3.27.  AF  Broadcasting  Service  (AFBS)  Items.  Submit  requisitions  for  AF Broadcasting  Service  (AFBS)  items  (project  code  SAR)  to  the  Television-Audiovisual  Support  Activity  (T-ASA),  Sacramento  Army  Depot  CA,  RIC  BS7. Submit  requisitions  for  AFBS  part-numbered  items  in  message  format  using  DIC A0E/A05.  Include  all  information  from  the  required  DD  Form  1348-6,  Non-NSN Requisition  (Manual),  in  the  message.  In  addition,  enter  the  T-ASA  management control  number  (MCN),  if  known,  in  the  remarks  block  of  the  message.  Media  and Status (M&S) code T will be entered in block 7 for all requisitions. This will ensure 100 percent supply and shipping status is furnished by T-ASA. After the message is prepared  and  released,  enter  the  requisition  into  the  ILS-S.  After  the  requisition  is entered,  immediately  process  a  supply  status  transaction  input  with  status  code  BD (delayed), and with an EDD of 45 days from the date of the requisition number. Note: Do not use A0B/A02 procedures to requisition AFBS items. 5.2.2.3.28.  Defense  Logistics  Agency  (DLA)  Vehicle  Parts.  The  DLA  Land  and Maritime  is  an  optional  source  for  vehicle  parts  to  Air  Force  vehicle  management 106 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 activities,  and  can  supply  repair  parts  for  commercial  vehicles  to  military  activities within  the  continental  United  States  and  overseas.  Bases  may  use  DLA  Land  and Maritime  as  an  alternate  source  of  supply  to  obtain  vehicle  parts  not  available  from local  procurement.  The  DLA  Land  and  Maritime  provides  vehicle  parts  to  AF Support for both national stock number (NSN) and non-NSN items are provided. All vehicle  part  requisitions  submitted  to  DLA  Land  and  Maritime  must  have  a  project code  assigned  to  align  the  requirement  to  the  specific  type  of  vehicle  equipment supported.  Applicable  project  codes  are:  JZO  (Administrative  Vehicles);  JZC (Commercial Construction Equipment); and JZM (Materiel Handling Equipment). 5.2.2.3.28.1.  Vehicle  Part  Requisitioning  Process.  Bases  submit  requisitions directly  to  DLA  Land  and  Maritime  (RIC  equals  S9C  or  SMS)  with  the  correct JZ(*)  project  code.  When  the  requisition  is  received,  DLA  Land  and  Maritime will  provide  supply  status  BZ  indicating  the  requisition  has  been  forwarded  for action.  When  the  requisitioned  item  is  not  included  on  the  DLA  Land  and Maritime contract, the requisition will be canceled. Excluded items include: non-price  listed  items;  tires;  hazardous  materials  (batteries,  flammables,  etc.); extended cost exceeds $10,000.00; and 463L pallets and associated equipment. 5.2.2.3.28.2.  DLA  Land and Maritime Actions.  Once the requisition is  accepted by DLA Land and Maritime, supply status BM with RIC S9J or SMS is provided to advise that the requisition is being supported through DLA Land and Maritime. When the asset is shipped, supply status BV is provided. 5.2.2.3.29.  Chemical  Warfare  Defense  Equipment  (CWDE).  When  Chemical Warfare  Defense  Equipment  (CWDE)  items  are  requisitioned,  enter  additional information on the output requisition (A0*) transaction as follows. 5.2.2.3.29.1.  DLA Requisition Data Requirements. If the source of supply is the DLA Troop Support, RIC S9T or SMS, the priority designator in positions 60-61 must be 05, required delivery date (RDD) in positions 62-64 must be S24, and the requisition advice code in positions 65-66 must be 2L. 5.2.2.3.29.2.  AFMC Requisition Data Requirements. When the source of supply is  AFMC  Air  Logistics  Complex  (WR-ALC),  RIC  FLZ,  the  requisition  must contain the applicable 6*-series requisition advice code. 5.2.2.3.30.  Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Service (DLADS) Items. All items withdrawn from DLADS are processed in the ILS-S as free issue. 5.2.2.3.30.1.  DLADS  Withdrawal  Authorization.  The  AO  provides  a  letter  to DLADS  identifying  the  individuals  authorized  to  authenticate  requisitions  for removal of assets from DLADS. This letter includes the base DODAAC, long line (mailing)  address,  telephone  number,  and  full  name  and  signature  of  individuals authorized to  authenticate direct  removal of DLADS  items  on behalf of the AO. Note:  Non-Appropriated  Fund  (NAF)  activities  with  their  own  DODAAC  will submit appointment letters directly to the servicing DLADS. Property received by NAF  activities  from  DLADS  must  be  for  administrative  or  other  purposes  from which no direct benefits will be realized by individuals (i.e., resale). 5.2.2.3.30.2.  Withdrawing Materiel from DLADS. All property withdrawals from AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 107 DLADS (regardless of the asset condition) must be for valid, documented official requirements.  DLADS  withdrawals  are  subject  to  the  same  criteria  as  requests from other DoD sources, i.e., all withdrawals must be properly accounted for and posted in the ILS-S. Local retail supply activities document and approve DLADS withdrawals  for  established  customer  or  stock  replenishment  requirements. Exception:  When  the  requested  item  is  AFMC-managed  (ERRCD  XD2)  and budget code 8, AFMC item manager approval must be obtained prior to physical withdrawal  of  the  asset  from  DLADS.  Item  manager  approval  is  necessary  to ensure there is a valid AF requirement for the asset prior to withdrawal. 5.2.2.3.30.2.1.  Manual  (offline)  requisition  log.  Customer  Support  maintains an  offline  (manual)  requisition  number  log  to  manage  withdrawals  from DLADS. At a minimum, the log contains the customer's name, organization, office symbol, phone number, intended use of the property, document number, stock  number,  nomenclature,  quantity,  and  a  suspense  date  for  a  copy  of  the completed paperwork to be returned to Customer Support. When the suspense date has passed, Customer Support contacts the customer for resolution. 5.2.2.3.30.2.2.  DLADS withdrawals for organizational requirements. DLADS withdrawals  for  organizational  requirements  must  be  for  assets  normally authorized  for  requesting  organizations  and  specific  customer  requirements. For audit purposes, base activities (other than NAF activities) must request all property  (regardless  of  condition)  located  in  DLADS  through  the  retail Materiel  Management  Activity.  The  retail  Materiel  Management  Activity ensures  the  requester  is  an  authorized  representative  of  the  requesting organizational  activity.  Authorization  for  organizational  DLADS  withdrawal may  be  accomplished  using  any  local  approval  procedure.  For  example, authorization  letters  from  the  unit  commander,  alpha  rosters,  or  simply checking  for  valid identification  may  suffice.  With  few  exceptions, organizational  requests  to  withdraw  property  from  DLADS  must  be established in the ILS-S to support valid customer requirements (due-out) and create audit trails for each DLADS withdrawal. 5.2.2.3.30.2.2.1.  Establishing  customer  due-out.  Items  pending  withdrawal from DLADS must be assigned a valid stock number in order to process the requirement  through  the  retail  Materiel  Management  Activity.  When required,  Customer  Support  processes  a  new  item  record  load  (FIL) transaction. When DLADS has a locally-assigned stock number (non- NSN) identifying the item, a new FIL transaction is required to load the new stock number using an L-serialized number. Place the DLADS local number (from the  DLADS  screening  sheet)  and  a  short  description  of  the  item  in  the nomenclature field of the item record load. Once the item record is loaded, an  issue  transaction  is  processed  in  the  ILS-S  with  TEX  code  H  and  the appropriate  Demand  Code  (recurring  vs.  non-recurring).  The issue transaction  creates  a  memo  due-out  detail  to  the  customer's  organization. Note:  This  customer  due-out  detail  may  be  established  before  or  after customer  visits  the  DLADS;  however,  normal  due-in-from-maintenance (DIFM) controls and demand data update requirements apply. If an item in 108 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 DLADS  contains  ERRCD  XD2  or  XF*  (regardless  of  serviceability),  it  is placed under DIFM control unless the item is not to be repaired or used for its original purpose. Items that will not be repaired or used for their original purpose may be processed, bypassing DIFM control, by using demand code I, J, K, L, or M, as appropriate. (T-2). 5.2.2.3.30.2.2.2.  Requisitioning  procedures.  When  property  required  to  fill the  due-out  requirement  is  available  in  DLADS,  Customer  Support processes  a  special  requisition  transaction  with  RIC  JBR  in  positions  4-6, and J, K, or L in position 40, the supplying activity DODAAC in positions 45-50,  and  the  due-out  document  number  in  positions  67-80.  The  JBR routing  identifier  code  ensures  property  is  released  to  the  customer  at  no cost. 5.2.2.3.30.2.3.  DLADS  withdrawals  for  stock  replenishment  requirements. LRS/Materiel  Management  Activities  may  withdraw  serviceable  items  from DLADS to fill stock replenishment requirements. In this situation, a customer due-out detail is not required. The special requisition transaction is processed with positions 67-80 blank. 5.2.2.3.30.2.4.  DLADS  Withdrawal  of  Accountable  Equipment  Items.  Refer to Chapter 5 5.2.2.3.30.2.5.  DLADS withdrawal of scrap materiel. If property identified as scrap is located in DLADS, automated DLADS withdrawal processing is not required.  Customer  Support  Liaison  personnel  prepare  DD  Form  1348-1A requisition  document  using  an  offline  requisition  number.  Place  the  word SCRAP in the stock number field. Mark the document “DO NOT POST,” and ensure  the  customer  returns  a  DLADS  signed  copy  of  the  completed document to Customer Support. 5.2.2.3.30.2.6.  DLADS  withdrawal  of  material  in  batch  lots.  When  DLADS has the required item in a batch lot, it is usually not necessary for the customer to  withdraw  the  complete  lot  to  obtain  the  needed  item.  When  part  of  the batch lot is  withdrawn, follow DLADS withdrawal  procedures for individual item withdrawal. If the customer wants the entire lot, the DD Form 1348-1A requisition  document  must  be  processed  as  DO  NOT  POST.  Customer Support  Liaison personnel  annotate the lot number in  the stock number field on  the  DD  Form  1348-1A  document  rather  than  identifying  individual  items by stock number.  After  withdrawal,  the customer will return the entire batch lot  to  the  retail  Materiel  Management  Activity  Inspection  functions  for  item identification and establishment of stock number records. (T-2). When an item record is not loaded for an item included in a batch lot, a new item record load transaction is required to load the item in the ILS-S. 5.2.2.3.30.2.7.  DLADS  withdrawal  requests  for  materiel  managed  by  other type  accounts.  Requests  for  withdrawal  of  DLADS  materials  normally managed  by  other  accounts,  e.g.,  medical  items  in  FSG  65,  will  not  be processed through the  ILS-S.  (T-1). Advise the  customer to  request  the item through the appropriate submission source. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 109 5.2.2.3.30.3.  Organizations  Geographically  Separated  From  DLADS.  When  the retail  Materiel  Management  Activity  and  requesting  activity/organization  are geographically  separated  from  the  DLADS,  the  AO  may  issue  a  block  of  DD Form  1348-1A  requisition  document  numbers  (with  the  stock  number  blank),  to geographically separated units. This is intended to preclude multiple trips between the DLADS and the LRS/Materiel Management Activity and must be monitored carefully.  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  prepares  the  DD  Form  1348-1A, leaving  the  stock  number  and  nomenclature  blank.  The  Materiel  Management Officer furnishes instructions for the customer on what data are to be added after identifying the item selected. log.  Customer  Support  Liaison  establishes  a 5.2.2.3.30.3.1.  Suspense suspense log to reflect requisition document numbers assigned on all DLADS withdrawals for geographically separated units. The log reflects the number of withdrawals,  signature  of  recipient,  category  of  property,  due  date  for  return of unused documents or copy of used documents, and any other pertinent data. 5.2.2.3.31.  Sole  Source/Brand  Name  Items.  AF  policy  allows  customers  to  request specific  “Brand-Name”  items  without  Base  Contracting  competing  the  requirement with  local  vendors.  Additionally,  customers  may  be  authorized  (with  certain limitations) to  request  a  specific vendor or one  “Sole Source” for items.  To comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requirements, the customer must provide a technical justification to Contracting for each Sole Source or Brand-Name request. (T-2).  The  customer  must  also  prepare  and  provide  any  technical  requirements  to support  the  justification.  (T-2).  DD  Form  1348-6,  Non-NSN  Requisition,  will  be prepared  to  provide  Contracting  a  complete  description  of  the  required  item.    Note: To ensure prompt processing, Customer justification statements may be expanded (as necessary) to ensure Contracting requirements are satisfied. 5.2.2.3.31.1.  Brand-Name  Requirements.  When  a  customer  specifies  that  only one manufacturer’s part number or specific item will satisfy requirements, Brand-Name requisitioning may be justified. The customer also specifies in writing what technical  requirements  exist  to  justify  use  of  a  brand-name  item,  rather  than procure  the  item  competitively.  A  DD  Form  1348-6  must  also  be  prepared describing  the  required  item.  (T-2).  The  DD  Form  1348-6  also  includes  the statement “DO NOT SUBSTITUTE”. Note: Brand-Name requisitioning does not necessarily justify sole source procurement. 5.2.2.3.31.2.  Sole-Source Requirements. When a customer specifies that only one vendor or Sole Source can supply the requested item (or suitable substitute), Sole Source requisitioning may be justified. The customer must specify in writing why the requirement can only be satisfied from one source. (T-2). A DD Form 1348-6 is used to describe the required item. The justification and DD Form 1348-6 will be forwarded to Research for checking against available commercial catalogs and federal supply schedules, to determine if the requested item can be procured from other sources within the date required. Research is required to annotate any other potential sources on the DD Form 1348-6. 5.2.2.3.31.3.  Recycled Products. AF policy requires the use of recycled products 110 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 when  available  and  practical.  Customers  are  responsible  for  using  recycled products, except when recycled products do not meet minimum quality standards for the intended use. When recycled products cannot be used for Brand Name or Sole  Source  requirements,  customers  must  include  in  the  justification  letter  the technical  or  mission  requirements  which  preclude  the  use  of  recycled  materials. (T-2). 5.2.2.3.31.4.  Brand  Name/Sole  Source  Request  Processing.  A  customer  due-out will  be  established  in  the  ILS-S  for  each  Brand  Name  or  Sole  Source  Request with demand code N (nonrecurring). This will ensure the ILS-S will not compute a  demand-based  stock  level  and  stock  the  requested  items.  Note:  When  a customer requires a Brand Name or Sole Source item more than once, and there is no  suitable  substitute  available,  have  an  AF  Form  86  prepared  to  have  the  item cataloged.  See  Request  For  Stock  List  Data:  Data  For  Input  #1  And  Input  #2 (BZA)  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  8  for  more  information  concerning  AF Form 86 processing. 5.2.2.3.32.  Base  Investment  (Budget  Code  Z)  Items.  The  ILS-S  will  not automatically  requisition  base  investment  (budget  code  Z)  items.  Equipment Management establishes a memo due-out (TEX 7) for each Budget Code Z customer request.  Once  the  memo  customer  due-out  is  entered  into  the  ILS-S,  a  350 management  notice is  produced.  See  General Use/Reject/Management  Notices  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  7  for  more information concerning processing of the 350 management notice. (Requisition  Suppressed) 5.2.2.3.32.1.  Funds  Availability.  Equipment  Management  sends the  350 management  notice  to  the  Customer  Support  to  check  the  availability  of  base investment  funds.  When  funds  are  not  immediately  available  for  the  requested item, the customer due-out detail will remain memo. As long as the requirement remains  unfunded,  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  Funds  Manager  or Customer  Support  retains  the  350  management  notice  in  suspense  in  a  locally determined sequence or they can utilize a local computer listing to sort all budget code  Z  requests  according  to  their  buy  priority.  The  Customer  Support  will establish  jacket  files  and  coordinate  with  Base  Budget  on  all  budget  code  Z requirements. (T-2). 5.2.2.3.32.2.  Determining Buy Priority. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity Resource  Management  activity  or  Customer  Support  Liaison  will  use  the  350 management notice or local listing/file to manage all budget code Z item requests according to their buy priority. (T-3). The buy priority depends on the customer's urgency of need (UND) and impact statements. The Financial Management Board (FMB)  determines  the  buy  priority.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity Funds Manager/Customer Support or Base Budget personnel will send the priority list  of  budget  code  Z  requirements  to  base  Accounting  and  Finance  budget personnel for submission to the applicable MAJCOM to get funding approval as required.  (T-2).  After  receiving  MAJCOM  approval  for  base  investment  item requests,  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  Funds  Manager  or  Customer Support  annotates  the  approved  350  management  notice  from  the  suspense  file indicating funds  are  available, and initiate special  requisitioning processing. The AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 111 LRS  will  coordinate  with  AFMC  on  any  non-local  purchase  budget  code  Z requirements  when  funding the  requirements  are requisitioned. (T-2). is  received to  ensure 5.2.2.3.32.3.  Customer Support will use the following instructions to prepare the special requisition transaction: 5.2.2.3.32.3.1.  Fund  code  assignment.  AFMC  will  assign  the  fund  code  for budget code Z requisitions based upon appropriations: 5.2.2.3.32.3.1.1.  Appropriation 57*3080--assign fund code 17. 5.2.2.3.32.3.1.2.  Appropriation 57*3600--assign fund code 29. 5.2.2.3.32.3.1.3.  Appropriation 97*0300 4802--assign fund code 8C. 5.2.2.3.32.4.  Industrial  Fund Activity  Budget  Code Z  Item Requisitions. Special requisitions for investment equipment for industrial fund activities will place the appropriate  fiscal  year  code  in  position  51,  the  industrial  fund  code  in  positions 52-53, and requisition advice code 2E in positions 65-66. 5.2.2.3.32.5.  AF  Materiel  Command Administration (GSA) Items. (AFMC) and  General  Services 5.2.2.3.32.5.1.  Requisition  Preparation.  Enter  a  certification  that  funds  are available for the fund code cited on the manual requisition form or an attached sheet/letter  signed  by  the  certifying  Financial  Services  Office  (FSO) individual.  For  overseas  bases,  enter  a  funds limitation  statement, MAXIMUM  FUNDS  AUTHORIZED  $XXXXX.00,  in  the  lower  right-hand corner of the requisition. When the maximum dollar amount of funds listed is too  low  to  procure  the  item,  the  supply  source  will  cancel  the  requisition.  If the  supply  source  cancels  the  requisition,  Records  Maintenance  calculates  a new standard price and process a unit price change (FCU) transaction. AFMC will then submit a new requisition with a new price. 5.2.2.3.32.5.2.  Prepare a special  requisition  IAW  Chapter  5  Enter the fiscal year  code  in  position  51  rather  than  the  signal  code.  This  action  will  ensure investment  funds  are  obligated  to  the  correct  activity.  Note:  For  overseas bases only, assign the applicable fund code in positions 52-53 based upon the appropriation. 5.2.2.3.32.6.  Interim  Processing  by  the  Customer  Support.  When  the  Funds Manager  or  Customer  Support  receives  the  completed  requisition  and  approved 350 management notices, the 350 management notice will be annotated with the current  date  and  all  documents  sent  to  FSO.  A  copy  of  the  350  management notice and all supporting documentation will be filed as locally determined. (T-2). 5.2.2.3.32.7.  Financial  Services  Office  (FSO)  Processing.  FSO  will  perform  the following actions after receiving the pending requisition: 5.2.2.3.32.7.1.  Certify funds are available. (T-2). 5.2.2.3.32.7.2.  Assign  the  applicable  appropriation  (budget  program  or program line number). (T-2). 112 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.2.2.3.32.7.3.  Retain a file copy of all supporting documentation.

Notify  the  LRS  Resource  Management  Activity  or  Customer Support  Liaison  that  the  requirement  was  funded  and  return  all  supporting documentation. (T-2). 5.2.2.3.32.8.  Final  Processing  by  the  LRS  Resource  Management  Activity  or Customer  Support  Liaison.  After  receiving  funding  notification  from  FSO,  the LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  Funds  Manager  or  Customer  Support  will destroy  the  suspense  copy  of  the  approved  350  management  notice.  (T-3).  The LRS/Materiel Management Activity Funds Manager or Customer Support Liaison will  request  AFMC  to  process  the  SPR  transaction  to  establish  a  due-in  detail, firm-up the customer due-out detail (if applicable), and update the budget code Z MACR. (T-2). 5.2.2.3.33.  Exchange  of  AF  Property  with  Commercial  Sources.  Whenever economically possible and efficient, AF policy allows the exchange of property with commercial  sources  to  satisfy  requirements.  The  exchanged  item  and  the  procured item must be similar; the procured item replaces and performs substantially all of the functions of the exchange item. If required, the exchange property has been made safe or harmless, or has been demilitarized. Lastly, the exchanged and procured items are eligible to be exchanged per Property Eligible For Exchange in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. Note: A list of Property Ineligible For Exchange is provided in the same reference. To request  a  waiver of  exchange requirements, a customer must  submit a fully justified request to  AF/A4LR. When approved, AF/A4LR will send the waiver request to GSA for action. 5.2.2.3.33.1.  Recording  of  the  Exchange.  The  item  being  procured  must  be recorded  and  issued  at  the  Latest  Acquisition  Cost.  Customers  must  submit  a letter  requesting  an  exchange  of  any  item  not  specifically  excluded  from  the program.  (T-2).  The  letter  will  contain  the  following  statement:  this  property  is offered  as  exchange  or  trade-in  under  the  exchange  provisions  of  the  Federal Property  and  Administrative  Services  Act  of  1949,  as  amended,  DoD  Materiel Management  Regulation  (DoDM  4140.01),  23  May  2003,  Category  Applies. Note:  Enter  the  numeric  category  from  Property  Eligible  For  Exchange  in  AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 5.2.2.3.33.2.  Customer  Support  Liaison/Equipment  Management  Actions. Depending on the commodity exchange (supplies/equipment), Customer Support Liaison or Equipment Management personnel will send AFMC three copies of the exchange request letter and a copy of the management notice showing the due-out and requisition document numbers. (T-2). 5.2.2.3.33.3.  Customer  Support  Liaison  Actions.  Customer  Support  Liaison personnel will record the requisition and due-out document numbers on all copies of  the  exchange  request  letter.  (T-2).  Customer  Support  Liaison  will  send  one copy  to  Contracting  and  file  one  copy  in  requisition  number  sequence.  (T-2). AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 113 Customer Support will work with BCO to ensure the item is eligible for exchange, the  LAC  is  assigned,  and  the  amount  of  credit  to  be  received  for  the  exchange item is determined. (T-2).  Customer Support must record the new item LAC and amount of credit on their copy of the request letter. (T-2). 5.2.2.3.33.3.1.  Notify  Inbound  Cargo.  Customer  Support  will  send  Inbound Cargo a copy of the exchange request letter with applicable cost information. (T-3).    Additionally,  Customer  Support  will  include  a  note  directing Receiving to process a receipt transaction for the exchanged item. (T-3). 5.2.2.3.33.3.2.  Verify  Receipt  or  Cancellation.  After  receipt  processing, Customer Support will retain the exchange request letter for one  year.  (T-2). Customer Support verifies that the customer has received the property or the due-out has been satisfied. If the item has not been received, or is still due-out, contact  Contracting to  obtain current  status  for the exchange item.  Customer Support will record the date of the review on the letter and file it for another year. (T-2). 5.2.2.3.33.3.3.  Processing  Exchange  Requisitions.  Customer  Support processes  exchange  requisitions  in  the  ILS-S.  Contracting  also  provides procurement  status  containing  Quantity  Purchased  Variance  Code  T  in  the local purchase status (LPS) or local purchase adjustments (LPA) transactions. When  Customer  Support  processes  the  LPS/LPA  transactions  with  Quantity Purchased  Variance  Code  T,  the  ILS-S  will  update  the  price  on  the  local purchase status  detail.  Note:  The  ILS-S will not change the unit price on the item record. 5.2.2.3.33.4.  Return  Processing  for  Exchangeable  Items.  When  the  new  item arrives,  the  customer  will  return  the  item  to  be  exchanged  to  LRS/Materiel Management  Activity.  Note:  Some  items  may  require  inspection.  When  the contractor or vendor request to inspect the exchangeable item, refer the inspection request  to  Contracting.  Customer  Support  Liaison/FSC  will  process  return transactions using the instructions in Sec. 6B, with TEX 8 or 1, and activity code E, P, or R, as applicable. 5.2.2.3.33.5.  USAF  Historical  Property  Issues.  All  USAF  historical  property issue requests will comply with AFI 84-103, USAF Heritage Program. (T-1). 5.2.3.  Issue to Supply Point, MSK, WRM, RSP, and Non-Airborne RSP Detail Records. 5.2.3.1.  Purpose:  To explain how to  process  issues to  supply  point, MSK, WRM, RSP, and Non-Airborne RSP detail records. For policy specific requirements, review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.2.3.2.  General  Discussion:  The  ILS-S  reformats  the  issue  from  detail  record  input transaction into a replenishment issue to detail record transaction during issue from detail processing. This process can only be bypassed by assigning a TEX “F” when processing the issue from detail record. When automatic replenishment transactions are bypassed or other  circumstances  dictate,  an  issue  must  be  processed  to  these  detail  records  to replenish  the  details.  The  ILS-S  will  only  issue  the  input  quantity  up  to  the  authorized level or backorder any unfilled quantity as appropriate under normal processing. 114 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.2.3.3.  The following actions will be taken when processing: 5.2.3.3.1.  Process replenishment issues to Supply Point detail records with: 5.2.3.3.1.1.  Activity  code  S,  organization  code  005,  and  applicable  supply  point code  in  the  document  number.  Use  demand  code  N  in  order  to  bypass  demand data update. 5.2.3.3.1.2.

TEX  M  to  bypass  kill  action  and  establish  a  backorder  for  the requested  item  when  substitute  items  are  available  with  equal  units  of  issue,  but the assets cannot be used. 5.2.3.3.1.5.  Urgency justification code CZ. 5.2.3.3.2.  Process replenishment issues to Mission Support Kit (MSK) detail records with: 5.2.3.3.2.1.  TEX codes 2, K, or 6 to prevent kill action of the input quantity (or part  of  the  input  quantity)  and  permit  issue  and/or  due-out  action  resulting  in excess detail record assets. 5.2.3.3.2.2.

Establish MICAP backorder. 5.2.4.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  MICAP  backorder  process.  For  policy  specific requirements review, AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.2.4.2.  General  Discussion:  The  MICAP  backorder  process  normally  begins  with processing  of  customer  issue  requests  as  described  in  Customer  Issue  Request  and Processing of this Chapter. 5.2.4.3.  When assets are not available to fill the issue request, the following actions will be performed: 5.2.4.3.1.  Aircraft  Parts  Store  (APS)  or  Customer  Support  Liaison  will  contact  the requesting  Maintenance  Production  Superintendent  or  equivalent  IAW  AFI  21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management to verify MICAP condition exists. (T-1). 5.2.4.3.1.1.  Customer Support Liaison or APS, will perform an exhaustive search for  available  local  resources  as  part  of  the  MICAP  verification.  Local  resources include, but are not limited to: 5.2.4.3.1.1.1.  Substitute or Interchangeable NSN (T-2). 5.2.4.3.1.1.2.  Time Change/Time Compliance Technical Order assets (T-2). 5.2.4.3.1.1.3.  Bench Stock assets (T-2). 5.2.4.3.1.1.4.  War Reserve Materiel (T-2). 5.2.4.3.1.1.5.  RSP and Non-Airborne RSP (T-2). 5.2.4.3.1.1.6.  Special purpose authorized maintenance (SPRAM) (T-2). 5.2.4.3.1.1.7.  Supply point (T-2). 5.2.4.3.1.1.8.  Component parts/repair list items. (T-2). 116 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.2.4.3.1.1.9.

Cannibalization of serviceable items from another unserviceable end-item will be considered if assets are not available for issue. (T-2). 5.2.4.3.2.  Once  all  local  resources  have  been  exhausted  establish  the  MICAP backorder 5.2.4.3.2.1.  The following paragraphs provide procedures for different situations: 5.2.4.3.3.  Standard MICAP: 5.2.4.3.3.1.  Aircraft  MICAP  request  will  be  reprocessed  with  TEX  7  unless AFMC notifies LRS/Materiel Management Activity that the ILS-S auto sourcing logic is to be utilized. 5.2.4.3.3.2.  Non-aircraft backorders will be reprocessed with TEX M. (excluding overseas contingency operations and NEXRAD MICAPs). 5.2.4.3.3.3.  Aircraft  Parts  Store  or  Customer  Support  Liaison  documents  the verification process in the ILS-S and include all pertinent data; part number, TO, figure,  index,  VIIN,  make,  model,  manufacturer,  etc.  (see  ES-S  User’s  Manual). Note:  For  units  supporting  a  Chairmen  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (CJCS)  operation, ensure an approved CJCS project code is used. 5.2.4.3.4.  Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) MICAP: 5.2.4.3.4.1.  Process with TEX X, FAD 2, MICAP FLAG N, and UJC 1C/JC 5.2.4.3.4.1.1.  When  the  IT  system  is  inoperable,  requirements  will  be  called into the Customer Support or handled according to local instructions and input into the IT system with TEX "7" when the IT system becomes operable. 5.2.4.3.4.2.  Customers notify AFMC of all NEXRAD MICAP incidents. 5.2.4.3.4.3.  AFMC support for NEXRAD items is as follows: 5.2.4.3.4.3.1.  Process transactions for NWS managed reparable items in-line. The requisition will be funded by AFMC Air Logistics Complex (Ogden) and forwarded to the Primary Inventory Control Activity (PICA), G13. 5.2.4.3.4.3.2.  Verify  asset  availability  by  inquiring  the  DLA  IT  system  or contacting the respective DLA Customer Interaction Center (CIC) for all DLA managed requirements. 5.2.4.3.4.3.2.1.  When assets are available, AFMC will call the requirement in to the appropriate DLA CIC. 5.2.4.3.4.3.2.2.  When  no  assets  are  available,  AFMC  will  check  the (National Website: Center http://www.roc.noaa.gov/WSR88D/) for asset availability. Logistics Support AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 117 5.2.4.3.4.3.2.2.1.  When assets are available at G13, AFMC will contact DLA CIC and inform the representative assets are available at G13 and they should process "BM" status to pass the requirement to G13 manual NEXRAD MICAP support: 5.2.4.3.4.3.3.  AFMC will assign an off-line requisition number. 5.2.4.3.4.3.4.  For  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  managed  reparable, MICAP  requirements  must  be  processed  in-line  with  the  MICAP  controller ensuring  that  the  correct  supplementary  address  is  entered.  The  requisition should  go  directly  to  AFMC  Air  Logistics  Complex  (Ogden/FGZ)  for processing.  When  the  requisition  is  not  in  the  DO35A  system  the  MICAP Controller will enter the requisition information into DO35A. 5.2.4.3.4.3.5.  For  consumable  items,  the  MICAP  controller  checks  for  asset availability at the respective DLA CIC (SMS). When assets are available, the MICAP  controller  calls  the  requirement  into  the  appropriate  DLA  CIC.  The MICAP  controller  ensures  the  correct  supplementary  address  is  given  and informs the CIC representative the requirement is for a NEXRAD emergency. When  no  assets  are  available,  the  MICAP  controller  also  checks  the  NWS website  for  asset  availability.  When  assets  are  available  at  G13,  the  MICAP controller  will  contact  DLA  CIC  with  offline  requisition  information  and inform  the  DLA  CIC  customer  service  representative  assets  are  available  at G13 and to process "BM" status to transfer the requisition to G13. (T-2). 5.2.4.3.4.3.6.  When  the  IT  system  is  back  in-line,  AFMC  will  process  a special requisition transaction to load the requisition number. 5.2.4.3.5.  Local Manufacture (RIC: JBD) Items MICAP: 5.2.4.3.5.1.  Complete previously addressed MICAP validation process. 5.2.4.3.5.1.1.  Check availability of end-item and all bits and pieces needed to manufacture the item. 5.2.4.3.5.2.  Parts  Available.  Reprocess  the  issue  request  for  the  end-item  using the  appropriate  MICAP  UJC,  when  the  bits  and  pieces  required  to  manufacture the item locally are available. 5.2.4.3.5.3.  Parts Not Available. Reprocess both the killed end-item and the bits and pieces required for manufacture with the appropriate MICAP UJC if the bits and pieces required to manufacture the item locally are not available. 5.2.4.3.6.  Transient Aircraft MICAP Support. 5.2.4.3.6.1.  When a maintenance team is dispatched to repair a transient aircraft at a location with an AF SRAN, establish a due-out at the transient location IAW procedures described in Standard MICAP. 5.2.4.3.6.2.  Transient Locations without Supply Accounts. 5.2.4.3.6.2.1.  When assets are available from Aircraft’s Home Base. Assets to satisfy MICAP conditions for a transient aircraft are required at a location that does  not  contain  an  Air  Force  SRAN,  issue  the  required  assets  at  the  home 118 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 base  to  the  home  base  maintenance  activity.  Note:  Maintenance  personnel will either dispatch a home base maintenance team or process maintenance-to maintenance  shipment  procedures  to  ship  the  assets  to  the  activity  that  will repair  the  aircraft.  Home  station  maintenance  personnel  and  aircraft commander  will  ensure  that  reparable  (unserviceable)  assets  are  returned  to home station either with the aircraft or through transportation channels (using DD  Form  1348-1A)  to  clear  any  DIFM  detail  records.  (T-2).  Assign  DIFM status code Aircraft Cross Country (AXC) to the DIFM detail to indicate the asset is at a transient location. 5.2.4.3.6.2.2.  When  assets  are  not  available  from  Aircraft’s  Home  Base. When  assets  to  satisfy  MICAP  conditions  for  a  transient  aircraft  (non-home station)  are  required  at  a  location  where  no  Air  Force  SRAN  exists  and  a home  base  maintenance  team  will  not  be  dispatched,  the  home  station  will process a MICAP due-out using the home station maintenance organizational account.  AFMC  will  source  for  assets  to  fill  the  MICAP  requirement.  Once lateral  assets  are  found,  AFMC  will  create  a  manual  lateral  shipment document using the address of the recovery location. The shipment documents will authorize shipment of the required assets to the aircraft commander where the aircraft is located. The home station of the transient aircraft is accountable for the shipped assets. The manual shipment documents (DD Form 1348-1A) will  contain the  aircraft commander: 1) the reparable items should be returned to the home station of the  aircraft;  and  2)  the  aircraft  commander  should  contact  home  base maintenance  to  pick-up  the  reparable  items.  AFMC  will  process  the  manual shipment in the applicable ILS-S to the home station supply account. the  remarks  block  advising instructions in transfer 5.2.4.3.6.2.3.  Transfer  of  Asset  Accountability.  To asset accountability,  the  home  station  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  will process  a  receipt  transaction  once  notified  by  AFMC  that  the  asset  was delivered  to  the  recovery  location.  (T-2).  The  home  station  maintenance activity  will  advise  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  to  update  the DIFM  status  to  “AXC”  to  indicate  the  asset  is  at  a  transient  location.  (T-2). The Materiel Management Flight or equivalent at the shipping base will also email/FAX a set of all shipping documents to the home station of the aircraft to  the  Asset  Management  Section.  (T-2).  The  due-out  release  and  shipping documents  will  be  cross-referenced  in  the  ILS-S.  Two  copies  of  each  issue document and one copy of the receiving document will be forwarded to base maintenance  Production  Control  pending  return  of  the  aircraft.  Production Control will ensure reparable items are picked up when the aircraft returns and the  items  are  processed  through  base  maintenance  using  normal  DIFM procedures. (T-2). 5.2.4.3.6.3.  Air  Mobility  Command  (AMC)  and  Air  Force  Special  Operations Command  (AFSOC)  Transient  Aircraft.  For  AMC  aircraft,  the  theater  AMC Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) will help the LRS CC/AO locate assets for lateral  shipments  to  satisfy  MICAP  requirements.  For  AFSOC  aircraft,  the AFSOC  Combat  Logistics  Office  (CLO)  will  assist  to  locate  assets  for  lateral AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 119 shipment to satisfy the MICAP requirements. Information requisition data (stock number,  unit  of  issue,  quantity,  part  number,  technical  order,  figure  and  index) will be furnished to the AFMC, who will provide -- an offline requisition number to  the  TACC/CLO.  Item  indicative  data  such  as  nomenclature,  part  number, technical  order  reference,  and  complete  aircraft  identification  will  also  be provided. The applicable TACC/CLO will conduct theater lateral support searches to satisfy transient aircraft MICAP requirements. 5.2.4.3.6.4.  No Available Lateral Assets. If the item is not available from theater resources, the TACC/CLO may pursue CANN options, or AFMC will generate an off-line requisition to the source of supply. 5.2.4.3.7.  D035K  MICAPs.    The  DLA  D035K  supply  activity  will  enter  Depot Maintenance  MICAPs  into  ES-S  and  request  AFMC  support  in  satisfying  the requirement from base level assets.  AFMC will take the following actions: 5.2.4.3.7.1.  Source for availability of assets and enter the results of the sourcing query into the ES-S MICAP order bullets. (T-2). 5.2.4.3.7.2.  When  assets  are  available,  process  the  lateral  shipment  and  update the  ES-S  MICAP  order  bullets  accordingly  to  include  updates  to  the  shipping status. 5.2.4.3.7.3.  When  AFMC  is  unable  to  locate  assets  laterally,  they  will  enter  the reason  why  in  the  ES-S  MICAP  order  bullets  and  the  DLA  supply  activity  will resume ownership of the applicable MICAP requirement. (T-2). 5.2.5.  Requisition Submission. 5.2.5.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  requisitioning  procedures  for  establishing  base-generated requisitions. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific use AFH 23-123. 5.2.5.2.  General Discussion: Under normal processing, the ILS-S will generate automatic requisitioning  actions  to  the  source  of  supply.  General  ILS-S  automated  (inline) actions/processes are found in  AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt  1, Ch 5, Requisition Submission. When  circumstances  prevent  automatic  requisitioning,  an  off-line  requisition  must  be submitted. 5.2.5.3.  The following actions will be performed for manual (off-line) requisitioning: 5.2.5.3.1.  Lateral support requisition submission. 5.2.5.3.1.1.  AFMC  or  Weapon  System  Support  Activities  will  process  all  non-MICAP lateral support requests. 5.2.5.3.1.2.  AFMC will request lateral support to and from NATO forces utilizing the  Acquisition  and  Cross  Serving  Agreement  through  project  officer  at  HQ USAFE/A4RI. 5.2.5.3.1.3.  AFMC  may  telephone  lateral  support  requisition  requirements  to other AF bases using the following instructions: 5.2.5.3.1.3.1.  Provide  the  lateral  support  base  with  an  offline  requisition 120 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 number. See Requisition Serial Number Assignment in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,  Ch  5  for  more  information  about  assigning  offline  requisition  serial numbers. 5.2.5.3.1.3.2.  Prepare  a  special  requisition  transaction  to  load  the  requisition and  corresponding  due-in  details.  Input  the  same  offline  requisition  number given to the lateral support base to ship the item(s). Note:  To link the lateral due-in  with  the  customer  due-out,  enter  the  customer  due-out  document number  in  positions  67-80  of  the  SPR  transaction.  See  SPR  transaction  in AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for  more  information  concerning  special requisition input processing. 5.2.5.3.2.  Part number requisition submission. 5.2.5.3.2.1.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity for submission  (and  status  management)  of  part  number/p-serialized  national  stock number  request  to  source  of  supply  with  the  exception  of  MICAPs  to  an  F(XX) source of supply, these will be processed by AFMC. responsible is 5.2.5.3.2.1.1.  For special requisition input processing, see Special Requisition (SPR) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 5.2.5.3.3.  Local Purchase Requisition Submission. 5.2.5.3.3.1.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  is  responsible  for  local purchase/local  manufacture  requisitions.  See  Sec.  3B,  for  additional  information on establishing Local Purchase requests. 5.2.5.3.4.  Purchasing  centrally  managed  XB/XF  items  related  to  weapon  systems with  Government  Purchase  Card  (GPC).  Specific  procedures  for  processing  GPC purchases  are  outlined  in  AFI  64-117,  Air  Force  Government-Wide  Purchase  Card (GPC) Program. For GPC purchases in support of vehicle maintenance requirements also refer to AFI 24-302. 5.2.5.3.4.1.  Obtain local purchase authority. 5.2.5.3.4.1.1.  AFMC  will  request  local  purchase  authority  and  a  qualified source from the applicable Weapon System’s Program Director (SPD) for all MICAP requirements. 5.2.5.3.4.1.2.  AFMC  will  advise  the  requesting  activity  of  the  approval  for local  purchase  and  provide  the  requesting  activity  with  the  qualified  source information. Note: The decision to purchase the asset with the GPC rests with the requesting activity. 5.2.5.3.4.2.  For  non-MICAP  requirements,  the  requesting  activity  will  be responsible for obtaining SPD approval for GPC purchase. 5.2.5.3.4.3.  The  requesting  activities  are  responsible LRS/Materiel Management Activity to process Due Out Cancellation, TEX 9. to  coordinate  with 5.2.5.3.4.4.  AFMC will process a monthly script to extract all TEX Code “9” Due Out  Cancellations.  and  process  a  Demand  History  Adjustment  in  the  applicable DLA Materiel Management IT System to capture demand data for the quantity of AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 121 DLA items procured through local purchase for all DLA managed budget code 9 assets (for both MICAP and non MICAP requirements). 5.2.5.3.5.  Items  requiring special requisitioning  procedures. See Special  Requisition (SPR)  Transaction  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for  processing  instructions required  to  create  and  submit  requisition  transactions  for  special  types  of  items  or conditions. 5.2.5.3.5.1.  AMC  FSL  Requisition  Built-Up  Items.  AFMC  assigns  command stock  numbers  to  selected  assemblies  requiring  build-up,  assembly,  cure  dating, etc. Requisitions for command stock number items do not require DD Form 1348-6, non-NSN requisition (manual). 5.2.5.3.5.2.  Built-up  items  with  a  command  stock  number  assigned  will  be processed in-line. 5.2.5.3.5.3.  AMC FSLs will submit telephone, fax or email requisitions to AFMC for  built-up  up  items  that  do  not  have  a  command  stock  number  assigned  (i.e., wheels and tires). 5.2.5.3.6.  Special  Requirements  Indicator  (SRI).  Special  requirements  indicator (SRI) R is used on special requisition transactions to requisition items that the ILS-S will  not  requisition  automatically.  AFMC  will  use  the  instructions  contained  in Special Requirements Indicator (SRI) R in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 to assign SRI R requisitions. Note: The LRS/Materiel Management Activity is responsible for SRI assignment on JBB/JBD and non-MICAP Part number requisitions. 5.2.5.3.6.1.  SRI "R" may be used by the AFMC to ship serviceable assets deemed as  excess  from  Forward  Operations  Support  Element  (FOSE)  or  contingency location  deployment  back  to  Primary  Supply  Point  (PSP)  or  home  station  of deployed unit. 5.2.5.3.6.2.  SRI "R" may be used by the AFMC to support contracted Inventory Control Points (ICP) requirements. (This may include Boeing, Lockheed, etc.) 5.2.5.3.6.3.  The  following  examples  describe  other  situations  where  a  SRI  may be needed. Use of the SRI R for the listed examples or any other conditions will be at AFMC’s discretion. 5.2.5.3.6.3.1.  Items Assigned a Local Unit of Issue (-1 Stock Numbers). 5.2.5.3.6.3.2.  Bulk Purchase Items (ready mixed concrete, fuel oil, coal, etc.) 5.2.5.3.6.3.3.  Unsupportable MRSP/IRSP Requirements. 5.2.5.3.6.3.4.  Calendar  Requirements  Greater Requirements. than  Combined  Due-Out 5.2.5.3.6.3.5.  Minimum Requirements. Buy/Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) 5.2.5.3.7.  REX  Codes.  REX  codes  are  a  one-position,  alpha/numeric  code  assigned to stock numbers to restrict or modify output requisition transactions. Numeric REX codes  are  normally  assigned  as  described  in  Requisition  Exception  (REX)  Codes, 122 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. Alpha REX codes are locally, AFMC, or MAJCOM assigned and used to modify requisitions. See the reference above for a complete list of REX codes and processing instructions for each. 5.2.5.3.7.1.  AFMC will review and take action on stock numbers assigned REX codes listed in the Requisition Exception Code (REX) table in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 on an as required basis. "As required" is determined by a customer requirement  or  automated  releveling  processes.  AFMC  will  annually  audit  REX 4s  ensuring  there  is  complete  processing  data  in  the  nomenclature  field.  Note: IEX "D"s will also receive annual audits. Additionally, REX codes will be deleted as  necessary,  e.g.,  if  a  part-numbered  or  non-NSN  item  changes  to  an  active (cataloged)  stock  number,  the  routing  identifier  code  (RIC)  changes  to  a  new source  of  supply  that  will  support  base  requirements,  the  exception  no  longer applies to the item, etc 5.2.5.3.7.2.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  function  responsible  for monitoring  each  REX  code  must  prepare  and  maintain  an  exception  control (ECC)  image  for  each  item  IAW  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  8,  Exception Phrase  Load,  Change,  or  Delete  (FXR).  REX  codes  may  be  manually  loaded, changed, or deleted with a stock control data (FCD) transaction. See Procedures for Stock Control Data – Load/Change/Delete Input (FCD) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for format and processing instructions for FCD transactions. 5.2.5.3.7.3.  Suppress Automatic Requisitioning. Requisition exception codes 1, 3, and 4 will cause the  ILS-S to  suppress  requisition transactions, regardless of the assigned  exception notice code  (ENC). However, requisitions are suppressed for all REX-coded items if ENC R (Reject) is assigned. REX codes are also used to identify  requisitions  which  require  external  management  review  before submission. Assignment of ENC P (Process) to the REX exception phrase record will cause the ILS-S to enter the REX code in position 71 of the output requisition transaction. 5.2.5.3.7.3.1.  Before  submitting  the  output  requisition  transaction  to  the supply  source,  AFMC  must  blank  position  71.  Note:  This  does  not  apply  to local purchase requisition transactions printed on DD Form 1348-1A. 5.2.5.3.7.4.  Requisition  Override  Records.  Requisition  exception  (REX)  codes may  also  be  used  to  force  the  ILS-S  to  override  normal  requisition  data  as specified  by  the  exception  phrase  record.  Requisition  exception  phrase  records loaded  for  this  purpose  are  identified  as  requisition  override  records.  Any  alpha requisition exception code may be used as a requisition override record. Properly established  requisition  override  records  will  improve  local  requisitioning  and reduce  the  need  for  manual  (offline)  requisitions.  Conversely,  improper requisition override records will generate invalid requisitions and internal records. Use  exception  notice  code  (ENC)  P  (process)  when  you  create  requisition override records. 5.2.5.3.7.4.1.  AFMC will manage the requisition override program. 5.2.5.3.7.4.2.  AMC will coordinate assignment of requisition override records AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 123 with AFMC to ensure requisitions are correctly routed. See Exception Codes and Exception Code Control (ECC) Management in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for more information concerning creating and maintaining ECC images. 5.2.5.3.8.  Fund  Requirement  (FRC)  File  Process.  The  following  actions  will  be performed: 5.2.5.3.8.1.  AFMC  will  process the  Fund  Requirement  Update/Analysis (R04/NGV857) Option 3 monthly and forward to the LRS. This report identifies Budget  Code  9  requirements  that  ILS-S  has  suppressed  when  the  requisitions: exceed  the  Maximum  Automatic  Obligation  (MAO)  authority,  do  not  pass  the Urgency  of  Need  Funding  Flag  (UNFF),  or  have  specific  SPC  edits.  Reference AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Sec  5B-  Ordering  and  Requisitioning  for  additional FRC file and image processing instructions. Note: AFMC approves requisitioning for Budget Code 9 items with stock fund FRC indicators. 5.2.5.3.8.2.  The LRS/Materiel Management Activity responsibility: 5.2.5.3.8.2.1.  .Review the Funds Requirement Update/Analysis, Option 3, as required to determine which due-outs to obligate. 5.2.5.3.8.2.2.  Review due-outs assigned JBx. 5.2.5.3.8.2.3.  Coordinate with organizations to ensure customers are aware of suppressed requirements. 5.2.5.3.8.2.4.  Coordinate with AFMC to obligate requirements. 5.2.6.  Due-Out Release (DOR). 5.2.6.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  DOR  procedures  process.  For  policy  specific requirements, review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.2.6.2.  General  Discussion:  Normally,  the  ILS-S  automatically  releases  serviceable assets to fill a customer backorder. Special circumstances may prevent automatic release, and automatic release of high priority items  can  be manually prevented.  These result in an on-hand balance for an item with due-outs loaded. When this occurs, the serviceable assets available have to be manually (forced) due-out released to fill the backorder. 5.2.6.3.  The following actions will be performed: 5.2.6.3.1.  To force release to a specific due-out: 5.2.6.3.1.1.  Review  applicable  management  notice  or  process  inquiry  in  the appropriate IT system to obtain due-outs for asset. 5.2.6.3.1.2.  Enter the desired document number  in  the force  DOR transaction in the ILS-S as outlined in Customer Due-Out-Release (DOR) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 5.2.6.3.2.

Modify Backorders. 5.2.7.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  modification  of  established  due-ins  and  due-outs.  For policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use  AFH 23-123. 5.2.7.2.  General  Discussion:  When  customer  backorders  require  modification,  the AFMC  (for  non-AFMC  supported  customers)  prepares  and  processes  a  due-in/due-out update transaction. 5.2.7.3.  The following actions will be performed: 5.2.7.3.1.  The  customer  is  responsible  to  submit  the  following  information  when backorder modification action is required: 5.2.7.3.1.1.  Stock number requested. 5.2.7.3.1.2.  Document number. 5.2.7.3.1.3.  Requisition number. 5.2.7.3.1.4.  Modification Requirement. The customer identifies  any or all of the following data elements for modification: 5.2.7.3.1.4.1.  Supplementary address. 5.2.7.3.1.4.2.  Project code. 5.2.7.3.1.4.3.  Force activity designator. 5.2.7.3.1.4.4.  Mark-for. 5.2.7.3.1.4.5.  Urgency justification code. 5.2.7.3.1.4.6.  Required delivery date. 5.2.7.3.1.4.7.  Ammo transaction code. 5.2.7.3.1.4.8.

For  MICAP  customer  backorders,  process  the  appropriate  MICAP Notification/Status in  accordance  with  MICAP Notification/Status (NOR) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. transaction ILS-S in the 5.2.7.3.3.1.  For MICAP customer backorders, AFMC will ensure priority due-in details are deleted or changed when corresponding customer due-out details have been cancelled or downgraded. 5.2.8.  Requisition Follow-up. 5.2.8.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  requisition  follow-up  procedures  to  validate/obtain status.    AFMC  is  responsible  for  all  requisition  follow-up  except  for  local  routing identifiers,  TCTOs,  and  non  -MICAP  part  number  requisitions.  The  LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  is  responsible  for  local  routing  identifiers,  TCTOs,  and  non-AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 125 MICAP part number requisition follow-up. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.2.8.2.  General  Discussion:  Use  manual  requisition  follow-up  procedures  when automated (INLINE) Requisition follow-up transactions discussed in Requisition Follow-Up,  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1  Ch  5  have  not  yielded  the  desired  results,  and  mission requirements  dictate is  required.  Manual  requisition  follow-up processing  may  be  conducted  alone  or  in  conjunction  with  automated  follow-up processing. improved  status 5.2.8.3.  The following actions will be accomplished for manual requisition follow-up: 5.2.8.3.1.  AFMC  will  perform  follow-up  for  all  off-line  lateral  support  requisitions when  no  shipment  is  loaded.  See  Requisition  Follow-Up  (AFC/FLP)  Input Transactions in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for processing information and input transaction format. 5.2.8.3.2.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  will  perform  follow-up  for  local purchase,  local  manufacture,  and  non-MICAP  part  number  requisitions  when necessary. (T-2). 5.2.8.3.2.1.  For  local  purchase  requisitions  with  status,  see  Requisition  Follow-Up in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for automated follow-up transaction format, frequency, and processing instructions. 5.2.8.3.2.2.  For  local  purchase  requisitions  without  status,  see  Requisition Follow-Up  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for  automated  requisition reinstatement  follow-up  transaction  processing  instructions  and  transaction format. 5.2.8.3.2.3.  For  local  manufacture  requisition  follow-up,  Requisition  Follow-Up in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for  more  information  and  processing instructions. 5.2.8.3.3.  Priority  requisition  follow-up  transaction.  Utilize  the  priority  requisition follow-up  transaction  for  priority  01-08  requisitions  containing  unsatisfactory estimated  delivery  dates.  See  Requisition  Follow-Up  (AFC/FLP)  Input  Transactions in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for processing instructions and format. 5.2.8.3.4.  Action  required  transaction.  AFMC  is  responsible  for  centrally  managed item  action  required  status  images.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  is responsible for all routing identifier JXX action required transactions. See Requisition Follow-Up in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for transaction processing information and format. 5.2.8.3.5.  Supply assistance request message. When all other attempts have failed to acquire  current  or  improved  status  for  priority  01-08  requisitions,  the  supply assistance request message should be used. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity will assist customers with preparing supply difficulty and supply assistance requests for  forwarding  to  AFMC.  (T-2).  AFMC  will  combine  base  inputs  and  submit assistance  requests  to  the  appropriate  action  ALC/ICP,  and  return  responses  to  the initiators.  The  supply  assistance  request  message  informs  the  source  of  supply  how 126 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 the  lack  of  the  requisitioned  item  affects  mission  support.  See  MILSTRIP  Supply Assistance  Request  Message  Format  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for  the MILSTRIP supply assistance message format and submission procedures used by the Materiel Management Activity. 5.2.8.3.5.1.  Method  to  Request  Supply  Assistance. A request  for assistance may be  accomplished  by  electronic  mail  (computer--DDN),  message,  letter,  or telephone to the appropriate supply source. 5.2.9.  Requisition Reconciliation. 5.2.9.1.  Purpose:  To ensure requisitioned materiel  is  still required and valid.  For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.2.9.2.  As this is a system intensive process, see Requisition Reconciliation in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for processing instructions to automated responses using the ILS-S to ensure requisitioned materiel is still required and valid. 5.2.10.  Requisition Status. 5.2.10.1.  Purpose: To explain the requisition status procedures process. AFMC manages status  for  centrally  managed  item  requisitions.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity will  manage  status  for  local  purchase,  local  manufacture  and  non-MICAP  part  number requisitions.  (T-2).  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.2.10.2.  General  Discussion:  AFMC,  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel must ensure all status is processed immediately, no matter how the status is received. If status is not processed immediately, more workload may be created due to invalid follow-ups,  receipt  rejects,  and  requisition  cancellations  and  billings.  AFMC  must  establish management  notice  suspense  files  for  status  problems.  Most  status  transactions  are processed  internally  by  the  ILS-S,  however  some  require  external  handling.  AFMC, LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel must make decisions on each management notice received to correct individual status problems. 5.2.10.3.  The  following  actions  will  be  accomplished  in  performing  requisition  status updates: 5.2.10.3.1.  F4(**)  management  notices.  The  ILS-S  will  produce  F4**  management notices to  explain processing actions for  each cancellation status  code received. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for detailed instructions for each management notice. 5.2.10.3.1.1.  SRI.  If  a  special  requirement  indicator  is  assigned  to  the  due-in detail,  the  system  will  add  a  third  line  of  print  on  the  F4**  management  notice specifying  the  flag.  See  Special  Requisition  (SPR)  Transaction  in  AFH  23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for more information concerning SRI assignment. 5.2.10.3.2.  Processing  Cancellation/Rejection  Status.  AFMC,  LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  personnel  will  process  rejection  and  cancellation  status.  The following  paragraphs  detail  specific  instructions  for  processing  the  most  common types  of  rejection/cancellation  status  you  will  receive.  See  MILSTRIP,  Intra-Air Force, And Intra-Base Requisition Status Codes and Phrases in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 127 Pt 1, Ch 5 for a complete list and explanation of each type of status code that may be received and for status transaction format and instructions. 5.2.10.3.2.1.  Cancellation Status Code BF (No Record of Requisition). When the wholesale  source  of  supply  does  not  have  a  record  of  an  ILS-S  requisition,  the wholesale supply system generates a status transaction with status code BF. 5.2.10.3.2.1.1.  Cancel  the  requirement.  If  the  due-in  and  due-out  should  be canceled, enter TEX 9 in position 51 of the status transaction and re-input. 5.2.10.3.2.1.2.  Re-requisition the requirement. If the canceled quantity should be  requisitioned  again,  enter  TEX  R  in  position  51  of  the  status  transaction and re-input. 5.2.10.3.2.1.3.  Decrease  the  requirement.  If  the  cancellation  should  be processed  to  delete  or  decrease  only  due-in  details  and  corresponding  status details, enter TEX P in position 51 of the status transaction and re-input. 5.2.10.3.2.1.4.  Current  status  exists.  In  this  situation,  do  not  re-input  the status transaction. Take this action when due-in and status details exist in the ILS-S with current status. Note: Follow-up processing will force the source of supply to confirm they do not have a record of the requisition. See Sec. 5B for more information concerning ILS-S follow-up processing. 5.2.10.3.2.2.  Cancellation  Status  Code  CA.  The  source  of  supply  notifies LRS/Materiel  Management  Activities  of  CA  cancellations  by  message.  The message explains the reason for the cancellation and any additional requirements. When the message is received, AFMC processes a status (AE*) input transaction with  status  code  CA.  Note:  Status  code  CA  automatically  assigns  REX  code  1 which  prevents  further  requisitioning  action  for  the  item.  See  Requisition Exception (REX) Codes in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for a list of REX codes and  associated  processing  instructions.  If  AFMC  does  not  receive  the  CA cancellation  message,  the  ILS-S  will  generate  subsequent  follow-up  (AF*) transactions  to  the  supply  source.  See  Sec.  5B  for  more  information  concerning requisition  follow-up  processing.  Note:  The  supply  source  will  not  send  another message  to  the  base.  When  follow-up  transactions  are  received  by  the  supply source they send status (AE*) transactions with status code CA. When processed in the ILS-S, the CA status transaction will assign REX code 1 to the item record, update  cancellation  status  codes  on  the  routing  identifier  record,  and  output  an F436  management  notice.  See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  7  for  more information concerning F436 management notices. 5.2.10.3.2.3.  Cancellation  Status  Code  CW  (One-Time  Local  Purchase).  The ILS-S will generate a 421 Reject (input must be coded with TEX 9, P or R, and reprocessed)  when  requisitions  are  canceled  with  CW  status.  Use  the  following instructions to process CW cancellation status: 5.2.10.3.2.3.1.  When  the  canceled  quantity  will  be  locally  procured  to  meet the  requirement,  prepare  a  DD  Form  1348-6  according  to  the  instructions  in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8. Attach a copy of the 421 Reject to copy 2 (and 3 if required) and send to Contracting. The 421 Reject indicates to Contracting 128 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 this DD Form 1348-6 has been generated because of CW status. AFMC will submit a new requisition for the requirement. 5.2.10.3.2.3.2.  When  a  DD  Form  1348-6  has  been  previously  submitted  on this  item,  and  management  decides  to  procure  it  locally,  re-input  the  status transaction with TEX R in position 51. Do not send the DD Form 1348-6 and the 421 reject notice to the Base Contracting Office. 5.2.10.3.2.3.3.  When  the  due-in  and  due-out  on  the  item  is  canceled,  enter TEX code 9 in position 51 of the status transaction and re-input. 5.2.10.3.2.3.4.  When  the  item  cannot  be  locally  procured,  enter  TEX  P  in position  51  of  the  status  transaction  and  re-input.  This  action  will  delete  or decrease the due-in and status details. Submit a new requisition to the source of supply with advice code 2A. 5.2.10.3.2.3.5.  When the cancellation is for a local purchase due-in, only TEX codes 9 or R apply. 5.2.10.3.2.4.  Cancellation  Status  Codes  ZG  and  ZH.  For  cancellation  codes  ZG (item permanently not available from Base Contracting) and ZH (item temporarily not  available  from  Base  Contracting),  the  ILS-S  will  delete  the  requisition  and assign  REX  1  to  the  item  record.  The  primary  course  of  action  is  to  review  the requirement  for  these  items  with  the  customer  and  work  to  find  an  acceptable substitute. When a substitute is discovered, re-requisition the substitute item with a  new  requisition  number  through  Contracting.  If  a  substitute  cannot  be  found, assign  REX  2  to  the  item  record  using  a  Stock  Control  Data  (FCD)  transaction. This action will allow requisitioning again  from the primary source of supply as determined  by  the  federal  supply  class/MMAC  (FSC/MMAC)  table.  See management notice I964 in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information. 5.2.10.3.3.  Source  of  Supply  Substitute  and/or  Equal  Item  Offers.  The  source  of supply will notify the LRS/Materiel Management Activity through message or other correspondence  when  substitute  and/or  equal  items  are  available  to  satisfy requisitions.  When  notified,  Stock  Control  will  first  determine  the  unit  price  of  the offered item. When the extended cost of the requisition is greater than $499.99, or the item  is  considered  accountable  equipment  (ERRCD  equals  ND*),  Stock  Control contacts the customer to determine if the offered item is acceptable. When acceptable by  the  customer,  instruct  the  source  of  supply  to  provide  updated  status  (BH) containing the new (offered) stock number. When the offered item is not acceptable to the customer, instruct the source of supply to continue procurement (if possible) for the requested item. Note: The source of supply should establish a customer response suspense date. When a customer response suspense date is not provided by the source of response (acceptance/nonacceptance) to the source of supply within 7 workdays. Stock  Control customer supply, should submit the 5.2.10.3.4.  Request  for  Missing  Requisition  Information.  BD  status  suspends  the requisition  in  the  wholesale  supply  system  for  30  calendar  days  awaiting  Item Manager  review  and  action.  Bases  have  30  days  to  provide  requested  information. When  the  supply  source  does  not  receive  requested  information  within  30  calendar AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 129 days, the supply source cancels the requisition using status code D3 (Canceled). See MILSTRIP, Intra-Air Force, And Intra-Base Requisition Status Codes and Phrases in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 or more information concerning D3 status processing. 5.2.11.  Requisition Tracing. 5.2.11.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  requisition  tracing  procedures  process.  For  policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.2.11.2.  General Discussion: When requisitions (shipments) become overdue or lost in transportation  channels,  the  ILS-S  initiates  tracer  action  through  government  and commercial  transportation  sources.  Tracer  action  is  also  used  to  recover  the  lost shipment.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  managers  use  the  DTR  4500.9-R  to trace  and  resolve  lost  or  misplaced  requisitions  (shipments)  that  contain  an  ILS-S shipment  status  detail.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  must  ensure  that  all required tracing actions are completed on schedule. (T-2). 5.2.11.3.  The following actions will be performed for requisition tracing: 5.2.11.3.1.  AFMC will process the Tracer Reconciliation (NGV597) program on the first and third weekend of each month. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for more information  about the  Tracer  Reconciliation  program,  output  products,  and distribution instructions. 5.2.11.3.2.  Managing the  Tracer  Action  Reconciliation.  The  ES-S  Tracer Reconciliation  (NGV597)  Program  creates  the  Transportation  Tracer  Listing  and tracer  action  required  transaction  images  for  CONUS,  and  SHIPMENT  TRACER FOLLOW-UP  transaction  images  for  OCONUS  bases.  Customer  Support  uses  the Transportation  Tracer  list  and  output  transaction  images  to  determine  what,  when, and how shipment tracing actions should occur. See Requisition Tracing in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for tracer action required processing instructions. 5.2.11.3.2.1.  Customer Support Initial Actions. 5.2.11.3.2.1.1.  Review  the  List  for  Repeat  Entries.  Before  any  other processing action is taken, compare the new list to the previous list. When all actions  from  the  previous  list  have  not  been  completed,  then  the  new  listing will  contain  repeat  entries.  Line  off  any  repeat  entries  on  the  new  list  and complete  the  required  actions  on  the  previous  list.  Set  up  controls  to  ensure timely processing of the listings and completion of required action before the next list is run. 5.2.11.3.2.1.2.  Delete  Items.  Process  a  tracer  action  required  image  with  an asterisk  (*)  in  position  7  for  Unclassified  and  Pilferable  items  with  a  dollar value  of  less  than  $100  to  immediately  delete  them.  Any  other  item  will  be reported  as  a  SDR  regardless  of  dollar  value,  after  the  Cargo  Movement confirms that the shipment was lost, destroyed, or Proof of Delivery could not be  furnished.  Follow  procedures  outlined  in  DLM  4000.25,  Vol  2,  Ch  17, Supply  Discrepancy  Reporting  for  SDR  reporting.  SDR  reporting  is  also applicable  to  unclassified  and  pilferable  items  above  $100,  after  the  Cargo Movements  confirms  that  the  shipment  was  lost,  destroyed,  or  Proof  of 130 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Delivery  could  not  be  furnished.  Use  the  ES-S  SDR  function  as  the  primary means  to  submit  SDRs  and  SF  364  when  the  ES-S  SDR  function  is  not available. See ES-S User’s Manual Chapter 14. 5.2.11.3.2.1.3.  Processing  Output  Products.  Processing  the  Transportation Tracer  Listing  program  will  produce  DD  Form  1348-1A,  I306,  and/or  I198, I116, and F080 management notice(s). Process the output as follows: 5.2.11.3.2.1.3.1.  Shipped-short receipt. Send the short-shipped receipt (I306 management notice) to Document Control for filing. 5.2.11.3.2.1.3.2.  F080 management notice. If an F080 management notice is produced, write the following message on the front of the F080: DOES NOT MEET  DOLLAR  REPORTING  CRITERIA.  PLEASE  DELETE  CLAIMS RECEIVABLE  DETAIL.  Send  the  notice  to  Accounting  and  Finance  for their action. 5.2.11.3.2.1.3.3.  Management  notice  distribution.  Route  the  I198  and/or I116 management notices to the appropriate work center for processing. See AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  7  for  more  information  concerning  I198  and I116 management notices. 5.2.11.3.2.1.4.  Distribute  the  Listing.  Send  copies  1  and  2  of  the  list  to Document Control for screening. 5.2.11.3.2.2.  Document Control Action. Document Control will check each entry on the listing against the Document Control receipt suspense and completed files to  determine  if  the  shipment  has  been  received.  Verify  the  complete  14  position document  number  against  the  receipt  files,  paying  close  attention  to  any  suffix code. Annotate the listing for items that have been received with RECEIVED or IN  FILE  (DATE).  Document  Control  will  return  both  copies  of  the  listing  to Customer Support within 3 workdays of receiving the listing. 5.2.11.3.2.3.  Customer  Support  Subsequent  Actions  Following  Document Control Review. 5.2.11.3.2.3.1.  Processing  Actions  for  Items  Marked  Received  or  In  File (Date) by Document Control. 5.2.11.3.2.3.1.1.  Prior  to  forwarding  the  transportation  tracer  list  to  Cargo Movement  for  processing,  take  immediate  action  to  line  through  those entries  that  Document  Control  has  marked  as  received  or  in  file  (date). Coordinate  with  Cargo  Movement  to  ensure  they  understand  no  action  is needed  on  these  items.  Note:  When  Customer  Support  chooses  to  take action  on  these  items  prior  to  forwarding  the  listing  to  Cargo  Movement, extreme care must be taken to not delay Cargo Movement processing of the listing. 5.2.11.3.2.3.1.2.  Immediately  forward  the  listing  to  Cargo  Movement  for their actions. 5.2.11.3.2.4.  Cargo Movement Actions. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 131 5.2.11.3.2.4.1.

Screening  Cargo  Movement  Statements.  After  receiving  the annotated  Transportation  Tracer  Listing  from  Cargo  Movement,  ensure  only valid statements listed in AFI 24-203 are used. When the listing includes other statements,  return  the  listing  to  Cargo  Movement  for  corrective  action  as described in AFI 24-203. 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.  Based upon Cargo Movement remarks; complete the following actions: 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1.  Received  or  in  file  (date).  First  check  the  transaction history to see if shipped status transactions processed after a partial receipt. 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1.1.  When  the  transaction  history  indicates  a  partial receipt  (with  the  same  suffix  code  as  the  tracer  action  required  detail) before  updated  shipment  status  processed,  process  a  tracer  action required  transaction  with  a  D  in  position  7  to  delete  corresponding shipment status details. 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1.2.  When  a  partial  receipt  is  not  involved,  and  Cargo Movement indicates the  shipment  has been received on base, process  a tracer  action  required  transaction  with  action  code  A  to  update  the transportation tracer flag on the shipment status detail to A. Action code A  will  move  the  shipment  to  the  Receipt  Acknowledged  Error  Listing indicating  the  shipment  has  been  received  on  base  and  not  by LRS/Materiel Management Activity. 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1.3.  Customer  Support the following  actions  after  processing  the  tracer  action  required  transaction with action code A: responsible is to take 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1.3.1.  Receipt processing. When the receipt processed incorrectly, rejected, reverse-posted, or did not process, take action to correctly process the receipt. 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1.3.2.  No receipt. When the receipt cannot be located, prepare a DD Form 1348-1A (Shipped-Short) receipt and process it as follows: 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1.3.2.1.  Shipment received. Check with the customer to determine if the customer physically received the shipment. When the customer received the shipment, create a DD 1348-1A receipt document and briefly explain on the front how this determination was made. The Customer Support supervisor or Materiel Management Officer validates the customer receipt statement. Furthermore, ensure the receipt has processed correctly and have the customer sign the Due-Out Release (DOR) document acknowledging receipt for the shipment. Customer Support will annotate the listing with actions taken, attach supporting documentation, and send all documentation to Document Control for filing. (T-2). 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.1.3.2.2.  Shipment not received. When the customer has not received the shipment, prepare a DD 1348-1A receipt and attach a copy of the supporting documentation. Next, send all 132 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 documentation to Inventory for special inventory processing. See Sec. 5G, of this chapter for inventory processing. 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.2.  Cargo Movement tracing. This annotation indicates Cargo Movement  will  trace  the  shipment  through  transportation  channels. Customer Support then processes the tracer action required transaction with a  B  in  position  7  to  indicate  the  shipment  is  being  traced  through transportation  channels  and  updated  status  will  be  provided.  Note:  Cargo Movement  monitors  all  items  being  traced  through  transportation  channels to ensure the tracing is completed before shipments appear 30 days later on the Exception Action Listing. 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.3.  Updated  shipment  status.  When  the  LRS/transportation activity provides updated shipment status, Customer Support will process a shipment  status  input  transaction  with  updated  date  shipped,  mode  of shipment  code,  Transportation  Control  number  (TCN)  or  Government  Bill of  Lading  (GBL),  as  noted  by  Cargo  Movement.  (T-2).  See  Shipment Suspense  Record  (SSC)  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for  shipment status input transaction format and processing instructions. 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.4.  SF  361/Message  Attached.  When  Cargo  Movement annotates the Transportation Tracer Listing with SF 361/Message Attached, Customer  Support  processes  a  tracer  action  required  transaction  with  an asterisk  (*)  in  position  7.  This  annotation  indicates  tracer  action  was unsuccessful  and  the  shipment  is  considered  lost.  At  this  point,  Customer Support  prepares  a  Supply  Discrepancy  Report  (SDR)  via  the  ES-S  SDR function to the shipping activity and includes results of the tracer action and attaches any pertinent documentation. Use the SF 364 in the absence of the ES-S  SDR  function.  Processing  the  tracer  action  required  transaction  will produce  an  I306  management  notice  for  a  shipped-short  receipt. Additionally, tracer  action  required the transaction  will  delete corresponding  due-in  detail  and  change the  shipment  status  detail supplementary  address  to  TARREC.  This  processing  is  used  to  identify tracer  action  required  shipped-short  receipt  processing.  Note:  When  the shortage  meets  dollar  value  requirements  specified  in  DFAS-DE  7077.10-M,  the  ILS-S  will  create  a  Claims  Receivable  detail  and  an  F080 management notice. the 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.4.1.  F080  management  notice  produced.  When  an  F080 management  notice  is  produced,  send  a  copy  of  the  SF  361  received from Cargo Movement to Accounting and Finance for action. Customer Support processes a tracer action required transaction with action code C to  prevent  the  lost  shipment  from  appearing  on  the  Report  of  Item Discrepancy (ROD) Listing. 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.4.2.  F080  management  notice  not  produced.  When  an F080  management  notice  is  not  produced,  attach  a  copy  of  the  SF  361 (received  from  Cargo  Movement)  and  the  I306  management  notice (shipped-short  receipt),  and  send  both  to  Document  Control  for  action. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 133 Process a tracer action required transaction with action code C to prevent the  lost  shipment  from  appearing  on  the  Report  of  Item  Discrepancy (ROD) Listing. 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.5.  Previously  researched  by  Cargo  Movement.  Customer Support  should  check  the  previous  Transportation  Tracer  Listing  to determine  why  previously  identified  processing  was  not  completed. Customer Support will line off any duplicate entries on the new listing and return  it  to  Cargo  Movement  for  processing.  Immediately  complete  all processing  actions  from  the  previous  listing  and  set  up  controls  to  prevent the condition from happening again. 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.6.  Shipment  Tracer  Follow-up  action  required  (overseas bases  only).  When  Cargo  Movement  returns  the  Transportation  Tracer Listing  for  overseas  (OCONUS)  bases  with  the  annotation  “SHIPMENT TRACER FOLLOW-UP Action Required,” Customer Support will process these shipments as follows: 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.6.1.  Processing  tracer  action  required  transaction.  When the  shipment  is  being  traced  by  Cargo  Movement  through  shipment tracer  follow-up tracer  action  required transaction with a B in position 7. transactions,  process the 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.6.2.  Obtain updated shipment status from the AF shipper service  control  office  (SSCO).  Overseas  bases  send  shipment  tracer follow-up transactions to the AF Shipper Service Control Office (SSCO) or  HQ  AFMC  for  tracer  actions.  See  Tracer  Action  Request  (TM1) Transaction  For  Overseas  Bases  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for shipment format  and  processing instructions. When SSCO receives and processes shipment tracer follow-up  transactions,  shipment  status  reply  (TMA)  transactions  are  created and  transmitted  (by  message  or  email)  to  the  ILS-S  to  provide  updated transportation information. transaction tracer follow-up 5.2.11.3.2.5.2.6.3.  Processing  SSCO  Updates.  Upon  receipt,  process tracer  action  request  reply  transactions  in  the  ILS-S.  Conversely,  if  a message  or  email  is  received  from  the  SSCO,  Customer  Support  will prepare  and  process  a  tracer  action  request  reply  transaction  using  the format  listed  in  Tracer  Action  Request  Reply  (TMA)  Transaction  For Overseas Bases in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.

Keep the current Transportation Tracer Listing on file in Customer Support. Retain with the previous listing until the next scheduled listing is produced. 134 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.2.11.3.3.  Parcel Post Tracer Listing (TTF-P) Processing. 5.2.11.3.3.1.  The  Parcel  Post  Tracer  List  is  created  to  identify  and  trace shipments  shipped  by  parcel  post  (mode  of  shipment  code  G  or  H),  military ordinary mail (mode of shipment code 6), or express mail (mode of shipment code 7)  that  exceed  DTR  standards.  Note:  When  processing  is  not  completed  on  the current  listing,  the  shipments  will  appear  on  subsequent  Parcel  Post  Tracer Listings. 5.2.11.3.3.2.  Customer Support Action. Customer Support will review the Parcel Post Tracer Listing and take the following actions: 5.2.11.3.3.2.1.  Deleting  Shipments.  Unclassified  and  Pilferable  shipments with  a  dollar  value  of  less  than  $100  should  be  immediately  deleted  by processing a tracer action required transaction with an asterisk (*) in position 7.  Any  other  item  with  a  controlled  item  code  (CIC)  other  than  U  will  be reported  as  a  SDR  regardless  of  dollar  value,  after  the  U.S.  Postal  Service confirms that the shipment was lost, destroyed, or Proof of Delivery could not be furnished. Follow procedures outlined in DLM 4000.25, Vol 2, Ch 17 for SDR reporting. SDR reporting is also applicable to unclassified and pilferable items above $100, after Cargo Movement confirms that the shipment was lost, destroyed,  or  Proof  of  Delivery  could  not  be  furnished.  Use  the  ES-S  SDR function  as  the  primary  means  to  submit  SDRs  and  SF  364  when  the  ES-S SDR  function  is  not  available.  Note:  Processing  the  Tracer  Reconciliation (NGV597)  program  with  the  delete  option  will  automatically  delete  items (CIC  equals  U)  with  a  dollar  value  of  less  than  $100.00.  See  Tracer Reconciliation  (NGV597)  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  6  for  more information on deleting lost shipments valued less than $100. 5.2.11.3.3.2.2.  Tracer  action  required  Processing  Output.  Tracer  action required transaction processing produces a DD Form 1348-1A (shipped-short) receipt  document,  and  I306,  I198,  I116,  and  F080  management  notice(s). Process the output as follows: 5.2.11.3.3.2.2.1.  Send  the  I306  management  notice  (short-shipped  receipt) to Document Control. 5.2.11.3.3.2.2.2.  Write  the  following  message  on  the  front  of  the  F080 management  notice:  DOES  NOT  MEET  DOLLAR  REPORTING CRITERIA.  PLEASE  DELETE  CLAIMS  RECEIVABLE  DETAIL.  Send the notice to Accounting and Finance for their action. 5.2.11.3.3.2.2.3.  Route  the  I198  and/or  I116  management  notices  to  the appropriate work center for processing. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7. for more information and processing instructions. 5.2.11.3.3.2.3.  Annotate  the  Listing.  After  processing  tracer  action  required transactions and any related output as described above, cross the shipment off of the listing. 5.2.11.3.3.2.4.  Designate Controlled and Uncontrolled Shipments. Parcel post AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 135 shipments are mail-type shipments that are divided into two large categories: Controlled  and  Uncontrolled.  To  determine  if  shipments  are  controlled  or uncontrolled, check position 7 of the TCN/GBL field of the Parcel Post Tracer List.  Controlled  shipments  are  identified  by  the  following  characters:  C (Certified), I (Insured), or R (Registered). If position 7 does not contain one of these characters, then the shipment is considered uncontrolled. 5.2.11.3.3.2.5.  Distribute the Listing. Distribute the Parcel Post Tracer listing according to the following instructions: 5.2.11.3.3.2.5.1.  Controlled  shipment tracing  controlled shipments  (identified  by  a  C,  I,  or  R  in  position  7  of  the  TCN/GBL),  send the Parcel  Post  Tracer  Listing to  Document Control and  Inbound Cargo (if applicable) sections to determine if the shipments have been received. tracing.  For 5.2.11.3.3.2.5.2.  Uncontrolled  shipment  tracing.  For  tracing  uncontrolled shipments, send the listing to Document Control. 5.2.11.3.3.3.  Document Control Action. Document Control will check each entry on the Parcel Post Tracer Listing against Document Control receipt suspense files and  completed  receipt  files  to  determine  when  the  shipment  has  been  received. Verify  the  complete  requisition  (shipment)  document  number,  paying  close attention  to  the  suffix  code.  Mark  shipments  on  the  list  that  have  been  received with RECEIVED or IN FILE (DATE). If the item has not been received, mark the item with the statement, NO RECORD. Document Control will return the list to Customer Support within 5 workdays of receiving the listing. (T-2). 5.2.11.3.3.4.  Customer Support Processing of Annotated Parcel Post Tracer List. 5.2.11.3.3.4.1.  RECEIVED  or  In  File  (Date).  Customer  Support  will  check the transaction history to see if shipped status processed after a partial receipt. When the transaction history shows a partial receipt processed (with the same suffix  code  as  the  tracer  action  required  detail)  before  shipment  status processed, process a tracer action required transaction with Action Code D in position 7 to delete the shipment status detail. When a partial shipment is not applicable, Customer Support will process a tracer action required transaction with Action Code A in position 7 to reset the transportation tracer flag (TTF) on  the  shipment  status  detail  to  A,  and  indicate  shipment  will  appear  on  the Receipt  Acknowledged  Error  Listing.  Note:  Shipments  appearing  on  the Receipt  Acknowledged  Error  Listing  identifies  shipments  received  on  base but  not  received  in  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity.  See  Receipt Acknowledged Error Listing (TTF-A) Processing for more information. After processing a tracer action required transaction with  action code A, Customer Support will perform the following actions: 5.2.11.3.3.4.1.1.  Receipt processing. Determine if the receipt was processed correctly. When it was processed incorrectly, rejected, reverse-posted, or did not process, take action to correctly process the receipt. 5.2.11.3.3.4.1.2.  No receipt. When the receipt cannot  be located, prepare  a DD Form 1348-1A (shipped-short receipt) and process it as follows: 136 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.2.11.3.3.4.1.2.1.  Shipment  received.  When  determined  the  customer actually received the item, briefly explain on the front of the DD Form 1348-1A how this decision was made. The Customer Support Supervisor or  Materiel  Management  Officer  must  certify  this  statement.  (T-2). Customer Support will ensure the receipt is processed and the customer signs  the  due-out  release  (DOR)  document  to  acknowledge  physical receipt of the shipment. (T-2). Customer Support annotates the list with action taken and sends the documents to Document Control for filing. 5.2.11.3.3.4.1.2.2.  Shipment  not  received.  When  the  customer  has  not received  the  item,  send  the  I306  management  notice  (shipped-short) receipt,  along  with  a  copy  of  the  transaction  history  to  Inventory  for special inventory processing. When special inventory action validates a shortage,  Inventory  must  process  an  inventory  adjustment  transaction with  a  TEX  code  T.  Inventory  returns  the  receipt,  a  copy  of  the transaction  history  research,  and  any  output  from  the  inventory  to Customer Support. Customer Support annotates the list with action taken and sends all documentation to Document Control for filing. 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.  Processing  controlled  shipments  –  NO  RECORD.  Document Control or Inbound Cargo marks the shipment with NO RECORD, Customer Support will perform the following actions: 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.1.  Prepare parcel post shipment tracing transaction. (T-2). To initiate  tracing  on  controlled  Parcel  Post  shipments,  process  a  tracer  action required  transaction  with  action  code  T  in  position  7  to  create  an  output parcel  post  tracing  transaction.  Action  code  T  flags  the  ILS-S  shipment status  detail  to  indicate  an  output  parcel  post  tracing  transaction  has  been created.  See  Registered,  Insured,  and  Certified  Parcel  Post  Shipment Tracing (AFT) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for transaction format and processing instructions. 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.2.  Request  shipment  tracing.  (T-2).  Send  the  output  parcel post tracing transaction to the correct source of supply, to begin tracer action with the U.S. Postal Service. Once the source of supply determines shipment disposition,  they will send an offline message to  the Materiel Management Activity. When no response is received within 15 days, ILS-S inline follow-up programs will send another output parcel post tracing transaction. 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.3.  Lost  or  destroyed  shipments.  When  the  postal  service indicates the shipment was lost, destroyed, or proof of delivery could not be furnished, Customer Support will take the following actions: 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.3.1.  Process  tracer  action  required  transaction.  Customer Support will process a tracer action required transaction with action code asterisk  (*).  Once  processed,  the  ILS-S  will  build  a  shipped-short receipt,  delete  the  due-in  detail,  and  change  the  supplementary  address field  of  the  shipment  status  detail  to  TARREC.  ILS-S  processing  will produce  an receipt). Additionally, tracer action required transaction processing builds a billed I306  management  notice (shipped-short AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 137 not  received  delete  transaction  for  Accounting  and  Finance  program NGV960. (T-2). 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.3.2.  Parcel  post  shipments  with  special  dollar  value requirements.  When  the  parcel  post  shortage  meets  the  dollar  value requirements  specified  in  DFAS-DE  7077.10-M,  a  claims  receivable detail and an F080 management notice is produced. Upon receipt of the F080  management  notice,  prepare  and  forward  a  SDR  using  the  ES-S SDR function to the shipping activity. Use the SF 364 in the absence of the  ES-S  SDR  function.  When  the  extended  value  is  greater  than  $250 for  a  DoD  shipment  or  greater  than  $100  for  a  non-DoD  shipment, request reverse billing or credit action on the ES-S SDR function. 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.3.3.  Process  a  tracer  action  required  transaction  with action code C in position 7 to indicate an SDR was prepared. This action will  prevent  the  shipment  from  appearing  on  the  Report  of  Item Discrepancy  Listing.  Note:  A  tracer  action  required  transaction  with action  code  Asterisk  (*)  must  be  processed  first  or  a  112  REJ  will  be produced. 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.3.4.  Distribute  Copies  of  the  SDR.  Attach  a  copy  of  the SDR  to  the  DD  Form  1348-1A  (shipped-short  receipt)  and  send  it  to Document Control for filing. 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.3.4.1.  When a reverse-billing or credit action is not requested because of the item's dollar value, send a copy of the SDR to Accounting and Finance requesting the detail be deleted. 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.3.4.2.  When a reverse billing or credit action is requested because of the item's dollar value, keep a copy of the SDR in a suspense file until receipt of a reply. When a response is received that either grants or refuses credit, send the SDR and response to A&F for required action. 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.4.  Delivered Shipments. When the post office indicates proof of delivery, take the following actions: 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.4.1.  Process  the  tracer  action  required  transaction  with action taken code A in position 7. This action will place the shipment on the  Receipt  Acknowledged  Error  Listing  portion  of  the  Tracer  Action Required Listing. 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.4.2.  Process the receipt when it is located. 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.4.3.  Prepare a DD Form 1348-1A (shipped-short receipt) if the receipt cannot be located and process as follows: 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.4.3.1.  Shipment received. When it can be determined the customer received the shipment, briefly explain on the front of the DD Form 1348-1A how this determination was made. The Customer Support supervisor or Materiel Management Officer will certify the determination statement. (T-2). Ensure the receipt is processed and the customer signs the Due-Out Release (DOR) document acknowledging actual possession of the item. Customer Support annotates the listing with actions taken and sends to Document Control. 138 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.2.11.3.3.4.2.4.3.2.  Shipment not received. When the customer did not receive the shipment, send the receipt, along with a copy of the transaction history, to Inventory for special inventory processing. When the special inventory shows there is a shortage, Inventory must process an IRC with a TEX code T. Inventory returns the receipt, a copy of the transaction history, and any output from the inventory to Customer Support. Customer Support annotates the list with action taken and sends the documents to Document Control for filing. 5.2.11.3.3.4.3.  Processing  Uncontrolled Shipments  Not  Received. Uncontrolled  parcel  post  shipments  cannot  be  traced.  When  Document Control  indicates  the  shipment  was  not  received  (NO  RECORD),  Customer Support  will  process  a  tracer  action  required  transaction  with  Action  Code asterisk  (*).  (T-2).  The  ILS-S  will  build  a  shipped-short  receipt,  delete  the due-in  detail,  and  change  the  supplementary  address  field  of  the  shipment status  detail  to  TARREC.  ILS-S  processing  will  also  produce  an  I306 management  notice  (shipped-short  receipt).  At  this  point,  Customer  Support will  prepare  a  SDR  via  the  ES-S  SDR  function  to  the  shipping  activity  and include  results  of  the  tracer  actions  from  the  U.S.  Postal  Service  and  attach any  pertinent  documentation.  In  the  Absence  of  the  ES-S  SDR  function, use SF  364.

Annotate  the  Listing.  After  processing  tracer  action  required transactions and capturing any output, cross the shipment off the listing. 5.2.11.3.5.2.4.  Distribute  the  Listing.  Send  the  listing  to  Document  Control for their action. 5.2.11.3.5.3.  Document  Control  Action.  Document  Control  will  screen  the  lead TCN and the document number against the completed receipt files to determine if shipments  have  been  received.  Verify  the  complete  document  number,  paying close  attention  to  the  suffix  code.  Mark  received  items  with  RECEIVED  or  IN FILE (DATE). Mark shipments that have not been received with NO RECORD. Document Control will return the annotated listing to Customer Support within 5 workdays. (T-2). 5.2.11.3.5.4.  Customer Support Action. 5.2.11.3.5.4.1.  Supplemental  Shipments  Received.  When  Document  Control annotates  the  listing  for  supplemental  due-in  details  (document  number)  as RECEIVED  or  IN  FILE  (DATE),  determine  if  the  receipt  was  processed correctly.  When  the  receipt  was  processed  incorrectly,  rejected,  reverse-posted, or did not process, then reprocess the receipt correctly. 5.2.11.3.5.4.2.  Supplemental  Shipments  Not  Received.  Prepare  a  DD  Form 1348-1A (shipped-short receipt) when you cannot find the receipt and process it as follows: 5.2.11.3.5.4.2.1.  When  the  customer  actually  received  the  item,  briefly explain  on  the  front  of  the  DD  Form  1348-1A  how  this  determination  was made.  The  Customer  Support  supervisor  or  Materiel  Management  Officer will  certify  this  statement.  (T-2).  Additionally,  ensure  the  receipt  is processed  correctly  and  the  customer  signs  the  due-out  release  (DOR) document  acknowledging  receipt  of  the  item.  Customer  Support  annotates the listing with these actions taken and sends the document(s) to Document Control. 5.2.11.3.5.4.2.2.  When  the  customer  has  not  received  the  item,  send  the receipt, along with a copy of the transaction history, to Inventory for special inventory processing. When the special inventory shows there is a shortage, Inventory  must  process  an  IRC  with  a  TEX  code  T.  Inventory  returns  the receipt, a copy of the transaction history research, and any output from the inventory  to  Customer  Support.  Customer  Support  annotates  the  list  with action taken and sends the documents to Document Control for filing. 5.2.11.3.5.4.3.  Consolidated  Shipments  Not  Received.  When  Document Control  annotates  the  lead  TCN  and  supplemental  shipments  as  NO RECORD,  Customer  Support  will  research  the  lead  TCN  to  determine  what happened  to  the  requisition  number  (due-in).  Note:  The  Consolidated Shipment Error Listing does not include the stock number (NSN) for the lead TCN.  Therefore,  research  the  transaction  history  for  the  TCN  document number date to determine the stock number. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 141 5.2.11.3.5.4.3.1.  After  identifying  the  lead  TCN  NSN,  Customer  Support will  perform  another  transaction  history  to  determine  if  the  lead  TCN requisition  (due-in)  was  previously  deleted.  If  the  lead  TCN  due-in  detail was  deleted,  reestablish  the  due-in  document  number  in  the  ILS-S  with  a special requisition transaction. 5.2.11.3.5.4.3.2.  Prepare and process a shipment status transaction using the latest  shipment  data  available  on  each  supplemental  due-in  detail.  When research  indicates  a  receipt  was  processed,  determine  if  the  receipt processed correctly. 5.2.11.3.5.4.3.2.1.  When correct, prepare a receipt document (DD Form 1348-1A)  for  Document  Control.  Delete  any  erroneous  shipment  status details with tracer action required transactions using Action Code D. 5.2.11.3.5.4.3.2.2.  When  incorrect,  reverse-post  and  reprocess  the receipt  correctly.  When  you  cannot  obtain  current  shipment  status because  of  the  age  of  the  lead  TCN,  process  a  tracer  action  required transaction with Action Code D. Cancel any supplemental due-in details for  the  consolidated  shipment  with  a  supply  status  transaction  using cancellation  code  Z7.  See  Supply  Status  (AE*)  Input  Transaction  in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for supply status transaction processing instructions.  Note:  If  the  consolidated  or  supplemental  shipments  are received  by  the  Materiel  Management  Activity  at  a  later  date,  process the receipt(s) using receipt not due-in (RNDI) procedures. 5.2.11.3.6.  Exception Action Listing (TTF-F) Processing. 5.2.11.3.6.1.  This  listing  identifies  delayed  or  lost  shipments  Cargo  Movement marked  as  Cargo  Movement  TRACING  on  previous  Transportation  Tracer Listings. Note: For overseas (OCONUS) bases, the Exception Action Listing also identifies  shipments  for  which  a  shipment  tracer  follow-up  transaction  has  been submitted.  However,  no  shipment  tracer  follow-up  reply  transaction  has  been received. 5.2.11.3.6.2.  Customer Support Initial Action. Send the Exception Action Listing to Cargo Movements for action. 5.2.11.3.6.3.  Cargo  Movement  Action.  Within  5  workdays  of  receipt,  Cargo Movement will research and annotate the Exception Action  List with  one of the following statements. 5.2.11.3.6.3.1.  Received  or  In  File  (Date).  This  annotation  indicates  Cargo Movement  received  the  shipment  on  base  and  sent  it  to  LRS/Materiel Management Activity for their action. 5.2.11.3.6.3.2.  SF  361/Message  Attached.  This  annotation  indicates  the shipment was lost in the transportation channels. 5.2.11.3.6.3.3.  Updated  Shipment  Status.  This  annotation  indicates  Cargo Movement  received  updated  shipment  data.  Cargo  Movement  will  circle  the old shipment data and write the new shipment data above the old information. 142 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.2.11.3.6.4.  Customer  Support  Action  following  Cargo  Movement  Review. After  receiving  the  annotated  Exception  Action  Listing  from  Cargo  Movement, check to see if it contains any statements other than those listed above. When the listing includes other statements, return it to Cargo Movement for their action, as stated  in  AFI  24-203.  Otherwise,  complete  the  following  actions  based  upon Cargo Movement statements annotated: 5.2.11.3.6.4.1.  Received  or  In  File  (Date).  Process  the  tracer  action  required transaction  with  Action  Code  A  to  indicate  that  the  shipment  processed through  Cargo  Movement  channels,  but  has  not  been  received  by LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity.  See  if  the  receipt  was  processed correctly. When it was processed incorrectly, rejected, reverse-posted, or  did not  process,  take  action  to  correctly  process  the  receipt.  When  the  receipt cannot  be  located,  prepare  a  DD  Form  1348-1A  (shipped-short  receipt)  and process it as follows: 5.2.11.3.6.4.1.1.  Shipment Received. When the customer received the item, briefly explain on the front of the DD Form 1348-1A how this decision was made.  The  Customer  Support  supervisor  or  Materiel  Management  Officer will certify the statement.  Ensure the receipt is  processed in  the  ILS-S and the  customer  signs  the  DOR  acknowledging  actual  possession  of  the  item. Customer  Support  annotates  the  listing  with  action  taken  and  sends  the listing and supporting documents to Document Control. 5.2.11.3.6.4.1.2.  Shipment  not  received.  When  the  customer  has  not received  the  item,  send  the  shipped-short  receipt,  along  with  a  copy  of  the transaction  history,  to  Inventory  for  special  inventory  processing.  If  the special inventory shows there is a shortage, Inventory must process an IRC with a TEX code T. Inventory returns the receipt, a copy of the transaction history  research,  and  any  output  from  the  inventory  to  Customer  Support. Customer  Support  annotates  the  list  with  action  taken  and  sends  the documents to Document Control for filing. include  results  of 5.2.11.3.6.4.2.  SF 361/Message  Attached. When Cargo Movement  annotates the  Transportation  Tracer  Listing  with  SF  361/Message  Attached,  Customer Support will process a tracer action required transaction with an asterisk (*) in position  7  to  indicate  tracer  action  was  unsuccessful  and  the  shipment  is considered  lost.  At  this  point,  Customer  Support  will  prepare  a  Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) via the ES-S SDR function to the shipping activity and tracer  action  and  attach  any  pertinent documentation.  In  the  Absence  of  the  ES-S  SDR  function,  use  SF  364.  The tracer  action  required  transaction  will  produce  an  I306  management  notice (short-shipped receipt), delete the corresponding due-in detail, and change the shipment status detail supplementary address field to TARREC. Additionally, when the shortage meets the dollar value requirements specified in DFAS-DE 7077.10-M, the ILS-S will produce a Claims Receivable detail, and produce a F080 management notice. the 5.2.11.3.6.4.2.1.  F080  management  notice  produced.  When  an  F080 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 143 management  notice  is  produced,  send  a  copy  of  the  SF  361  from  Cargo Movement  to  Accounting  and  Finance  for  their  action.  Customer  Support will  process  a  tracer  action  required  transaction  with  Action  Code  C  in position  7  to  prevent  the  shipment  from  appearing  on  the  Report  of  Item Discrepancy Listing. Note: Process a tracer action required transaction with action code asterisk (*) first to prevent a 112 Reject. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for more information concerning 198 Rejects. 5.2.11.3.6.4.2.2.  F080  management  notice  not  produced.  When  an  F080 management notice is not produced, attach a copy of the SF 361 from Cargo Movement to the I306 management notice (shipped-short receipt). Send the all  supporting  documents  to  Document  Control.  Process  a  tracer  action required transaction with action code C in position 7 to prevent the shipment from appearing on the Report of Item Discrepancy Listing. 5.2.11.3.6.4.3.  Updated  Shipment  Status.  Process  a  shipment  status transaction with updated date shipped, mode of shipment code, Transportation Control  Number  (TCN),  or  Government  Bill  of  Lading  (GBL),  as  noted  by Cargo Movement. See Shipment Status (AS*/AU*) Input Transaction in AFH 23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for  shipment  status  transaction  format  and processing instructions. 5.2.11.3.7.  99S Requisition Tracing for Lateral Equipment/SPRAM Transfers. 5.2.11.3.7.1.  General  Discussion:  Requisitions  created  as  a  result  from  lateral equipment/SPRAM  transfers  are  not  captured  on  the  Transportation  Tracer Listing  (TTL).  Special  procedures  are  necessary  to  ensure  proper  tracking  and prevent materiel from becoming lost or overdue in transportation channels. 5.2.11.3.7.2.  EAE will: 5.2.11.3.7.2.1.

For  policy  specific  requirements  see  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT specific information see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 5.2.12.2.  General  Discussion:  Because  the  accuracy  of  backorders  in  the  IT  system  is important,  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  must  coordinate  with  organizations  to review and validate their backorders regularly. (T-2). AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 145 5.2.12.3.  The following actions will be performed: 5.2.12.3.1.  Customer  backorder  review.  Customers  review  backorders  for  their organizations  to  ensure  they  contain  valid  requisition  numbers.  Also,  customers should  ensure  requisition  numbers  have  current  status,  and  that  backorder  data elements (i.e., priority, project code, quantity, mark-for, etc.) are correct. 5.2.12.3.2.  Customer  backorder  validation.  Customers  validate  backorders  for  their organization  by  contacting  the  requestor  to  determine  if  the  item  is  still  required. UND  A  and  B  backorders  must  be  validated  at  least  monthly.  UND  C  backorders must  be  validated  at  least  quarterly.  Note:  Local  management  may  dictate  only weekly  reviews  are  required  for  UND  A  and  B  customer  backorders  for  equipment items. 5.2.12.3.3.

Review of UND A and B Customer Backorders. Each day, LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  will  coordinate  with  applicable  organizations  for  review  of customer  backorders  with  UND  A.  At  least  weekly,  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  will  coordinate  with  applicable  organizations  for  review  of  customer backorders with UND A and B. Note:  Management may determine daily processing is not warranted. Customers are not required to return listings received for backorder review.  Customers  must  notify  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  of  items  on  the listings no longer needed. (T-2).Notification can be via the listing, telephone, or other military correspondence. 5.2.12.3.5.  Validation of Customer Backorders: 5.2.12.3.5.1.  Monthly  Validation  of  Customer  Backorders.  The  backorder validation  listing  (M30),  or  equivalent,  for  all  due-outs  is  produced  monthly. UND  C  due-outs  are  required  to  be  validated  at  least  quarterly.  Note:  The LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  and  maintenance  organization jointly determine  when  the  validation  of  customer  backorders  with  the  IMDS  CDB system shall be accomplished. 5.2.12.3.5.2.  Validation  of  Customer  Backorders.  Validation  of  customer backorders  for  non-  IMDS  CDB  organizations  may  create  output  images  which can be input after the organization has completed the validation. In this case, these images  and  one  copy  of  the  validation  listing  are  retained  by  the  LRS/Materiel Management Activity. During backorder validation for IMDS CDB organizations, the images are forwarded to the applicable IMDS CDB organization. 5.2.12.3.5.3.  Validation  Processing.  To  validate  due-outs, the  supported organization should contact the person with the need for the backordered item to ensure  the  item  is  still  required.  It’s  essential  the  organization  validate  each dueout on the list and cancel those which are no longer required. When there are any changes or cancellations required, the customer organization must contact the LRS\Materiel  Management  Activity  in  writing  or  by  returning  an  annotated listing.  The  customer  organization  should  provide  a  point  of  contact  in  case  the LRS/Materiel Management Activity requires additional information. 5.2.12.3.6.  Validation  of  Base  Civil  Engineering  (BCE)  Customer  Backorders.  The M09,  or  equivalent,  serves  as  the  tool  for  validation  of  BCE  customer  backorders. The  computer  listings  are  distributed  with  a  letter  of  transmittal  to  BCE  Materiel Control  Section.  BCE  uses  the  same  procedures  as  other  customers  for  reviewing, validating,  requesting  changes  and  cancellations  to  existing  backorders.  In  addition, LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  use  the  M09,  or  equivalent,  in  the same method as the M30. LRS\Materiel Management Activity retains work copies of the  M09  and  M30,  or  equivalents,  for  the  purpose  of  reviewing  and  researching customer  backorders,  including  memo-obligated  backorders.  When  necessary, LRS\Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  will  requisition  for  support  or  cancel customer due-outs as appropriate. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 147 5.2.12.3.7.  Validation  of  Bench  Stock  Due-outs.  The  monthly  inventory  of  bench stocks fulfills the requirement to review and validate bench stock backorders. 5.2.12.3.8.  Backorder cancellations: 5.2.12.3.8.1.  Once  a  customer  has  determined  that  an  item  on  backorder  is  no longer required, they will contact the LRS\Materiel Management Activity to have the backorder cancelled. 5.2.12.3.8.2.  The  LRS\Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  will  process  a due-out  cancellation  as  described  in  Customer  Backorder  Due-Out  Cancellation (DOC)  Transaction,  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5.  The  LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  personnel  must  process  DOC  input  transactions  received from  the  base  Maintenance  on  the  same  day  to  ensure  Maintenance  and  Supply records remain coordinated. (T-2). 5.2.12.3.8.3.  When  necessary,  the  LRS\Materiel  Management  Activity  will process a request for due-in cancellation for local purchase, local manufacture and non-MICAP  part  number  requisitions.  (T-2).  See  Local  Purchase  Status Cancellation (LCC) Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 3 for processing instructions. Note:  Process due-in cancellation requests as required to ensure the requisition is not loaded at the source of supply. Section 5C—Physical Asset Management 5.3.  Physical Asset Management. 5.3.1.  Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDR). 5.3.1.1.  Purpose: To describe the procedures for submitting, following up, and replying to SDR. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.3.1.2.  General.  SDRs  will be submitted  IAW DLM 4000.25,  Vol 2, Ch 17. The SDR program is used to promote evaluation, correction, prevent recurrence and improvement of logistics operations. 5.3.1.3.  Incoming  SDRs.  Incoming  SDRs  should  rarely  occur  because  bases  are primarily  receiving  rather  than  shipping  activities.  The  preponderance  of  base  SDR activity pertains to “outgoing” SDRs, i.e., those sent to DLA, GSA, commercial vendors, and occasionally to other AF bases (lateral support). When incoming SDRs are received Customer Support Liaison Element will take appropriate actions to resolve discrepancies. (T-2). 5.3.1.4.  Outgoing  SDR  Submissions  (Reporting  Activity).  The  reporting  (receiving) activity will submit an SDR for all items, shipping or packaging discrepancies IAW DLM 4000.25-M, Vol 2, Ch 17. 5.3.1.4.1.  LRS personnel will use ES-S SDR function as the primary tools to submit SDR’s.  (T-1).  The  SF  364,  Report  of  Discrepancy  paper  form  can  be  used  as  a secondary tool until access to the ES-S SDR function is established. All requirements pertaining to SDRs throughout this section will be accomplished using the ES-S SDR 148 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 function.  Exception:  SF  364  paper  form  can  be  used  for  reporting  local  purchase discrepancies  to  the  Base  Contracting  Office  (BCO).  Refer  to  the  DLA  Customer Assistance Handbook via the web using CAC card for further information concerning current POC addresses, e-mails or phone numbers. 5.3.1.5.  Discrepancies  in  Item  Unique  Identification  Data  (IUID)  are  reportable  under shipping  discrepancy  criteria.  Coordinate  with  EAE  to  report  discrepancies  involving IUID to ensure contractual requirements are met. 5.3.1.6.  Adjustments.  Completed  SDRs  may  be  used  to  support  adjustments  to  the accountable  inventory  and  financial  accounting  records  of  both  the  reporting  and shipping activities. 5.3.1.7.  SDR Suspense Log. The reporting activity will maintain a consolidated ESS web SDR reporting tool to serve as the control log on all SDRs submitted.  (T-1). SDRs will remain in suspense until closed. An SDR is considered closed when: a reply is received, the  SDR  is  categorized  as  unresolved,  or  the  shipment  appears  on  an  ILS-S  script providing  shipment  loss  analysis.  Closed  SDRs  submitted  via  SF  364  Report  of Discrepancy paper form, will be maintained IAW AFRIMS. 5.3.1.7.1.  When a reply is received the suspense copy of the SDR may be closed. 5.3.1.7.1.1.  “Recorded  for  Information  Only-No  Action  Taken”  SDRs  will  be monitored for trend  analysis  and distributed to  the respective activities impacted by the SDR. (T-1). 5.3.1.7.1.2.  Units may request additional information when SDRs are received as Recorded for Information Only-No Action Taken and lack a clear narrative of the problem. 5.3.1.7.2.  SDRs  may  be  categorized  as  unresolved  based  on  the  lack  of  response  to follow-ups.  These  SDRs  will  be  processed  as  indicated  in  Unresolved  SDR  Actions paragraph 5.3.1.7.3.  The  Shipment  Loss  Analyses  Report  list  all  shipments  which  may  be potential losses, confirmed losses, and recovered shipments.  If a shortage SDR was submitted for an item that appears on this report in Part Three-Recovered Shipments, then  the  SDR  should  be  removed  from  the  file  and  canceled  since  the  SDR  is  no longer valid. 5.3.1.8.  Processing  Report  of  Discrepancy  Listings.  When  discrepant  receipts  are processed  in  the  supply  system  a  claims  receivable  or  claims  payable  details  will  be created.  The  ES-S-SDR  function  automatically  identifies  the  details  and  creates  an internal SDR record. Claims payable and claims receivable details that require an initial SDR or follow-up can also be obtained by processing the ILS-S program (See Report of Discrepancy List (NGV587) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for pertaining to accounts not  managing  SDRs  thru  ES-S).  The  program  also  produces  transportation  action required (TAR) inputs for all listed items. The listings and TAR inputs are used to ensure proper billing credit actions are taken. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 149 5.3.1.8.1.  Claims  Receivable  Details.  Claims  receivable  detail  records  are  used  to produce  informational  SDRs  and  to  request  billing  credit.  They  are  created  and deleted as follows: 5.3.1.8.1.1.  Creation. A claims receivable detail is created if one of the following conditions  exists  and  the  dollar  value  involved  is  greater  than  $100  for  non-Department of Defense (DoD) activities (Exception-greater than $25.00 for GSA) and greater than $100 for DoD activities: 5.3.1.8.1.1.1.  Receipt  Shortage.  When  a  shortage  is  processed  on  a  funded receipt  and  the  dollar  values  above  are  met,  then  a  claims  receivable  detail will  be  created  under  program  control  for  the  missing  item,  which  identifies the  Source  of  Supply  (SOS)  should  credit  the  funds  back  to  the  receiving activity  or  send  an  asset  to  fulfill  the  shortage.  Also  created  is  an  adjusted received-not-billed  (RNB)  detail  for  the  quantity  actually  received  as  the original RNB detail would have reflected the originally ordered total quantity due-in. 5.3.1.8.1.1.2.  Soon-to-be-Canceled  Due-In.  During  follow-up  processing, when a due-in detail is subject to valid cancellation, and a billed-not-received (BNR)  detail  exists,  then  a  reject  is  created  indicating  the  due-in  cannot  be cancelled  because  a  BNR  detail  exists  and  to  submit  a  report  of  discrepancy requesting credit. 5.3.1.8.1.2.  Deletion. A claims receivable detail is deleted under program control when  the  credit  billing  is  received  and  processed,  the  credit  billing  is  denied  by the source of supply, or  Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Field Site deletes it. 5.3.1.8.2.  Claims Payable Details.  Claims payable detail records are used to request billing credit for the SOS. They are created and deleted as follows: 5.3.1.8.2.1.  Creation.  If  an  overage  of  a  funded  shipment  is  processed  and  the overage is greater than $100 for DoD and non-DoD activities (Exception: greater than  $25.00  for  GSA)  then  a  claims  payable  detail  is  created  under  program control for the extra item(s) received. This detail identifies the receiving activity now owes funds to the SOS to pay for the additional asset received. 5.3.1.8.2.1.1.  Deletion.  A  claims  payable  detail  is  deleted  under  program control when the proper billing adjustment input has been processed. 5.3.1.8.3.  Items  on  the  Report  of  Discrepancy/Supply  Discrepancy  Report  Listing (See Report of Discrepancy List (NGV587) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6). The stock control portion of the listing shows each claims receivable detail which requires an SDR submission and which is a reclassified BNR detail. These claims receivable details have a B in the source-flag field. The listing and Tracer Action Request data files are produced to assist Customer Support in conducting follow-up. 5.3.1.8.4.  Items  on  the  Receiving  Listing.  This  listing  shows  each  item  which requires  a  SDR  submission  for  its  claims  payable  detail,  claims  payable  receipt overages,  and  short  receipt  claims  receivable  detail.  Receipt  overage  claims  details 150 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 will have a P (213 CLAIMS-PAYABLE-FLG) in the source-flag field. Short receipt claims  receivable  detail  will  have  an  S  in  the  source-flag  field.  See  DFAS-DE 7077.10-M,  Automated  Materiel  System  Interfaced  with  Supply  System  at  Base Level:D00  2A/GV,  User’s  Manual,  claims  receivable  and  received  not  billed  record layouts for source-flag indicators. 5.3.1.8.5.  Processing ES-S Report of Discrepancy Receipt Listings. When discrepant receipts  are  processed  in  the  SBSS,  they  are  stored  within  the  Air  Force  Supply Centralized Data Bank (AFSCDB). Each day, ES-S queries the AFSCDB transaction history table to identify all receipt transaction history records (TRIC of "REC") with Transaction  Phrase  Code  (TTPC)  equal  to  "8A",  "1B"  or  "9X"  and  meets  the following other business rules. 5.3.1.8.5.1.  TTPC equal to "8A", and 5.3.1.8.5.1.1.  TEX  code  equals  "Q"  or  "U"  then  the  discrepancy  is  an incorrect item, or 5.3.1.8.5.1.2.  Nomenclature contains "REC" in positions 4 - 6 and has an "S" in position 19, then the discrepancy is a shortage receipt, or. 5.3.1.8.5.1.3.  Nomenclature contains "TAR" in positions 4 - 6 and has an "S" in position 19, then the discrepancy is a TAR receipt, or. 5.3.1.8.5.1.4.  Nomenclature contains "REC" in positions 4 - 6 and has a "P" in  position  19,  then  the  discrepancy  is  a  claims  receivable  that  has  been reclassified as a Billed-not-Received. 5.3.1.8.5.2.  TTPC equal to "1B", and. 5.3.1.8.5.2.1.  TEX code equals "P" or "Z" then the discrepancy is a damaged item, or. 5.3.1.8.5.2.2.  Stockage  Priority  Code  equals  "J",  then  the  discrepancy  is  a record not due-in, or. 5.3.1.8.5.2.3.  Document  Number  and  Action  Quantity  equals  Document Number  and  Action  Quantity  of  other  receipt  transactions,  then  the discrepancy is a duplicate receipt, or. 5.3.1.8.5.2.4.  Demand  code  equals  "F",  "G",  "H",  "J",  "K:,  or  "L",  then  the discrepancy reparable) suspended material. (incomplete,  condemned, is  an  unserviceable 5.3.1.8.5.3.  TTPC equal to "9X", and. 5.3.1.8.5.3.1.  Nomenclature contains "REC" in positions 4 - 6 and has an "O" in position 19, then the discrepancy is an Overage receipt, or. 5.3.1.8.5.3.2.  Nomenclature contains "REC" in positions 4 - 6 and has an "E" in position 19, then the discrepancy is an Excess receipt, or. 5.3.1.8.5.3.3.  Nomenclature contains "REC" in positions 4 - 6 and has an "S" in position 19, then the discrepancy is a Shortage receipt, or. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 151 5.3.1.8.5.3.4.  Nomenclature contains "TAR" in positions 4 - 6 and has an "S" in position 19, then the discrepancy is a Shortage receipt. 5.3.1.8.6.  Initial  ES-S  SDR  Actions  on  the  Discrepancy  Receipt  Listing.  Once  the internal  SDR  records  have  been  created  in  ES-S,  ES-S  will  identify  those  records which  are  mandatory  "M"  and  those  that  are  optional  "O,  those  that  are  input manually by the field user "U", and those that are found to be duplicates "D" with the applicable letter in the source indicator field. Customer Support Liaison Element will use the listing to perform the following actions: 5.3.1.8.6.1.  Process  Mandatory  SDRs.  DOD  guidance  establishes  a  minimum reporting of discrepancy for "Mandatory" assets within 24 hours of discovery for shortage, overage, wrong item, and misdirected shipments. 5.3.1.8.6.2.  Process  Optional  SDRs.  DOD  guidance  establishes  a  minimum reporting of discrepancy for "Optional" assets within 60 calendar days from date of  shipment  for  CONUS  destinations.  For  overseas  destinations,  120  calendar days from date of shipment are allowed. At the discretion of the LRS commander, optional SDR records can be deleted from ES-S without being submitted. 5.3.1.8.6.3.  Manually  Created  SDRs.  For  those  receipts  not  captured  in  the business  rules  in  Sec.  5C,  where  the  CTH  does  not  indicate  that  the  transaction was  discrepant  (e.g.,  Wet  lumber,  improper  packaging)  an  SDR  can  be  created manually within ES-S. These are stored on the SDR Listing in ES-S with a source indicator code of “U”. 5.3.1.8.6.4.  Duplicate SDRs. When a receipt is processed matching the  business rule following Processing ES-S Report of Discrepancy Receipt Listings, then ES-S  creates  a  duplicate  “D”  SDR  record.  A  duplicate  SDR  record  can  be  created from TEX ‘Q’ receipts (receipt for misidentified materiel) as well. One will show up  as  “M”  (mandatory)  and  the  other  as  “D”  duplicate,  each  matching  the business rule in Sec. 5C. Only one of these SDRs needs to be submitted. 5.3.1.8.6.5.  Late  SDR  Submissions.  When  circumstances  prevent  compliance with the above time standards, e.g., response to a tracer action reveals a supposed transportation discrepancy to be a shipping/packaging discrepancy, the reasons for delay  shall  be  provided  in  a  brief  clear-text  explanation.  When  appropriate,  the responsible  activities  will  honor  the  discrepancy  report.  Reporting  activities  are required  to  send  SDRs  to  report  a  shipping  or  packaging  discrepancy  even  after the  above  submission  time  standard  has  elapsed.  When  lacking  justification, action activities will normally process for use in reporting metrics and corrective action,  when  appropriate.  The  SOS  shall  not  be  responsible  for  financial resolution  on  late  submission  SDRs  unless  shipment  history  is  available  and  the circumstances warrant such action. 5.3.1.8.7.  Initial  SDR  Actions  on  the  Stock  Control  and  Receiving  Listings. Customer  Support,  stock  control  function  will  review  the  Receiving  listing  and identify all claims receivable details created through the processing of a shipped short receipt.  (T-2).  For  all  such  details  on  the  listing,  and  for  all  details  on  the  Stock Control listing, they will perform the following actions: 152 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.3.1.8.7.1.  Process  SDRs.  Refer  to  DLM  4000.25  for  specific  dollar  value criteria.  DoD  guidance  establishes  a  minimum  reporting  dollar  value  of  $100, with  exception to  controlled  material  and  shipments  from  contractors, manufacturers, or vendors – these are mandatory. Prepare an SDR for each detail exceeding $100 per line item. Claims from $100 to $499.99 may be pursued at the local  level  initially,  and  will  forward  documentation  to  the  finance  center  or claims office for disposition if the claim cannot be settled. Claims above $500.00 are  mandatory  submissions.  Process  a  TAR  input  (see  Tracer  Action  Required (TAR) Transaction in  AFH 23-123,  Vol 2, Pt  1, Ch 5) with  action code  C. This input  will  update  the  detail  213-Billing-Request-Date  or  221-FAE-Date  to  show that an SDR has been submitted. 5.3.1.8.7.2.  Designate Details for Deletion. Identify shipments between DoD and non-DoD activities which are less than $100 per line item. DFAS Field Site will then  automatically  delete  the  corresponding  claims  receivable  or  payable  detail records. Annotate the SDR listings with the deletion actions taken. 5.3.1.8.8.  Follow-up  Listing.  SDR  follow-ups  will  be  prepared  and  processed  as specified in DLM 4000.25, Vol 2, Ch 17, Supply Discrepancy Reporting. To assist in the  follow-up  process  a  listing  that  shows  all  claims  receivable  and  claims  payable details  which  do  not  have  follow-up  SDRs  submitted  for  them  will  be  produced  by the Report of Discrepancy List. The follow-up schedule is determined by subtracting the 213-Billing-Request- Date or 221-FAE-Date on the detail from the Julian date of the SDR listings as follows: 5.3.1.8.8.1.  First  Follow-up.  Details  requiring  first  follow-up  action  are  those which appear on the list 55 days after the initial submission of the SDRs. Once a first follow-up has been submitted, a detail will not appear on the list again until 40 days after initial submission. 5.3.1.8.8.2.  Second  Follow-up.  Details  requiring  second  follow-up  action  are those which appear on the list 120 days after the initial submission of the SDRs. Once a second follow-up has been submitted, a detail  will not appear on  the list again and the SDR will be considered unresolved. 5.3.1.8.8.3.  Update  the  ILS-S.  When  a  follow-up  is  submitted,  process  a  TAR input (AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5) with an action code F to update the Billing-Request-Date and/or FAE-Date and show a follow-up has been submitted. 5.3.1.8.8.4.  Designate  Details  for  Deletion.  TAR  monitor  or  Customer  Support personnel will identify all non-classified item details appearing on the follow-up listing  for  DoD  shipments  valued  at  less  than  $100.  These  items  will  be designated  for  deletion.  DFAS  Field  Site  will  then  automatically  delete  the corresponding  claims  receivable/payable  detail  records.  All  classified  items, regardless of cost, will require follow-up action. 5.3.1.8.9.  ES-S  Follow-up  Listing.  SDR  follow-ups  will  be  prepared  and  processed as  specified  in  DoD  4000.25-M,  volume  2,  chapter  17.  ES-S  SDR  follow-ups  are completed as follows: 5.3.1.8.9.1.  Controlled Items. ES-S considers controlled items codes A, B, C, D, AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 153 E, F, G, H, K, L, O, S, T, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 as controlled. 5.3.1.8.9.1.1.  Discrepant controlled inventory items  (shortage/overage/wrong item/misdirected):    Total  response  time,  to  include  sequential  processing  by multiple action activities when necessary, will be resolved within 25 calendar days.  Wrong  item  receipts  identified  as  controlled/sensitive  and  unidentified items  will  be  returned  to  the  designated  location  within  30  calendar  days  of the  SDR  reply.  Sources  of  supply  will  monitor  for  the  return  and  follow-up with the SDR submitter if materiel is not returned. (T-0). 5.3.1.8.9.2.  Non-Controlled Items. ES-S considers non-controlled items codes as all  other  not  considered  controlled  in  IAW  this  chapter  and  the  follow-up  days are: 5.3.1.8.9.2.1.  First  follow-up.  Details  requiring  first  follow-up  action  are those  which  appear  on  the  list  55  days  after  the  initial  submission  of  the SDRs. ES-S will automatically generate the TAR "F", updating the 221 SBSS detail record. 5.3.1.8.9.2.2.  Second follow-up (Manual). Details requiring second follow-up action are those which appear on the list 85 days after the initial submission of the SDRs. 5.3.1.9.  Unresolved SDR Actions. A SDR is defined as unresolved by the SBSS when its reply  has  not  been  received  146  days  after  initial  submission.  Allow  additional  mailing time  for  overseas  bases.  ES-S  unresolved  SDRs  are  defined  as  unresolved  if  it  is  a controlled item and has not received a reply in 90 days or when it is a non-controlled item and has not received a reply in 115 days after initial submission. 5.3.1.9.1.  Forward  all  unresolved  SDRs  to  the  MAJCOM  for  assistance.  When MAJCOM  personnel  do  not  reach  a  resolution  for  the  SDR,  they  will  request assistance from the AF SDR focal point. 5.3.1.10.  SDR Reply Actions. 5.3.1.10.1.  Required  Replies.  Action  activities  are  required  to  reply  to  every  SDR submitted within the time limits specified in  DLM 4000.25, Vol 2, Ch 17. Shipping activity personnel will perform the following actions: 5.3.1.10.1.1.  Respond  to  the  SDR  indicating  the  appropriate  disposition,  e.g., acknowledgement  of  the  report,  disposition  of  the  material,  validation  of  the report with authorization of financial adjustment, and/or instructions for repair or other type of corrective action. Identify the interim disposition/status using up to three  disposition/status  (reply)  codes  available  from  the  DLMS  Data  Element Dictionary/Directory. 5.3.1.10.1.2.  Complete the information on the reverse side of the SDR. 5.3.1.10.1.3.  Indicate whether a billing adjustment will be issued. 5.3.1.10.1.4.  Forward the reply to the Customer Support Liaison Element. 5.3.1.10.2.  Process  Replies.  Customer  Support  Element  will  perform  the  following actions after receiving a reply to a SDR: 154 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.3.1.10.2.1.  Process TAR. When a reply is received, process a TAR (see Tracer Action Required  (TAR)  Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt  1, Ch 5)  with  an action code R to update the detail DOLT. (T-2). The detail will no longer appear on  the  SDR  listings,  and  it  will  remain  in  the  computer  until  the  proper  billing adjustment input is processed by DFAS Field Site personnel. 5.3.1.10.3.  Interim  Replies.  Responsible  action  activities  must  provide  an  interim reply  where  a  final  reply  cannot  be  provided  within  established  timeframes.  For additional information refer to DLM 4000.25, Vol 2, Ch 17. 5.3.1.11.  Management  Evaluation  of  the  SDR  Process.  DLM  4000.25,  Vol  2,  Ch  17 directs the institution of SDR quality programs and semi-annual reporting of results. SDR quality programs must be sufficient to identify trends, establish volume and dollar values of SDRs, identify problems with shipping activities, and assist in preventing recurrences. Note: This does not address Security Assistance (SA) SDRs. Action on SA SDRs will be prescribed by SAF/IA (see DLM 4000.25, Vol 2, Ch 17, Supply Discrepancy Reporting). 5.3.1.11.1.  The LRS CC/AO will ensure detailed SDR data is maintained to analyze their programs. Bases must collect information on the number of SDRs submitted and received,  dollar  value,  and  discrepancy  type.  The  number  of  follow-ups  responses received, unresolved SDRs, and dollar values recovered will also be measured. (T-2). Operations  Compliance  will  semiannually  report  the  effectiveness  of  the  SDR program to their respective MAJCOMs. (T-2). 5.3.1.11.2.  MAJCOMs will  collect  SDR  data  from  their  respective  units  on  a  semi-annual  basis  (reporting  periods  are  October  -  March  and  April  -  September)  the suspense for Oct - Mar is 30 April and for Apr - Sep is 31 October. This is necessary so MAJCOMs can evaluate the quality of their base SDR programs. MAJCOMs will ensure their units are collecting the minimum information shown in Table 5.2. from all sources of shipment or supply (e.g., AFMC Air Logistics Complexes, GSA, DLA (including Defense Distribution Depots), other Bases, and any other major source of supply.  MAJCOMs  may  prescribe  additional  information,  if  necessary.  MAJCOMs may be asked to provide data to AF/A4LR as needed.  Note: Data sent to AF/A4LR should only include overall trends and problems that cannot be resolved at MAJCOM and base levels.  5.3.1.11.2.1.

Storage Locations (Primary, Reserve, Bin Labels, Locator Files). 5.3.2.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  storage  location  procedures  process.  For  policy  specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.3.2.2.  The warehouse location system allows you to pinpoint the exact location of any item  in  your  warehouse  inventory.  Property  may  be  maintained  in  fixed  warehouses, supply  points,  transportable  spares  packages,  or  in  maintenance  activities  to  include  in-use assets. 5.3.2.3.  Before assigning a warehouse location, stockroom personnel must complete the following at a minimum: 5.3.2.3.1.  Ensure all unnecessary labels and tags are removed from outside of box. 5.3.2.3.2.  Ensure applicable serviceability tag/labels are attached. 5.3.2.3.3.  Ensure  the  item  is  properly  stored  in  correct  warehouse  (i.e.  NWRM, classified, pilferable, ESD, etc.). 5.3.2.4.  Assigning  Warehouse  Locations.  Refer to  Warehouse  Location Load/Change/Delete  (FCS)  input  transaction  and  Warehouse  Location  Format  in  AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for specific ILS-S information and processing. 5.3.2.4.1.  Primary  Storage  Locations.  Warehouse  personnel  assign  and  maintain primary warehouse locations for each serviceable item stocked. Primary locations are assigned to items using the warehouse location load/change/delete input transaction. 5.3.2.4.2.  Reserve  Storage  Locations.  The  LRS  CC/AO  will  establish  controls  to ensure reserve locations are assigned only as a last resort and that they are promptly deleted when no longer needed. 5.3.2.4.2.1.  When  used,  warehouse  personnel  will  cross-reference  bin  labels  or the bin label/holder of both primary and reserve locations. 5.3.2.4.2.2.  Items  under  detail  management  (e.g.,  readiness  spares  package (RSPs),  unserviceable  details,  in-use  equipment,  etc.)  may  contain  duplicate storage locations; however, the storage  facility must  have the  capability to cross reference  the  applicable  document  number  to  maintain  the  audit  trail  and  item accountability at all times. 5.3.2.4.3.  Processing  a  Warehouse  Location  Load/Change/Delete  Request.  Material Management  personnel  at  a  minimum  will  download  electronic  stock  number directory  from  LIMS-EV  weekly  for  each  warehouse/storeroom.  Follow  the  steps below to load, change or delete a warehouse location. 5.3.2.4.3.1.  Find an open warehouse location. 5.3.2.4.3.2.  Copy warehouse location and prepare temporary bin label which will 156 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 include  NSN,  warehouse  location,  Unit  of  Issue,  date  created  and  initials  of warehouse person. 5.3.2.4.3.3.  Enter  location  change  in  the  stockroom  suspense  log.  Develop  and maintain  warehouse (within stockrooms).  Minimum  information  will  include  NSN,  warehouse  location,  date processed, date new label was produced and detail record (if applicable). load/change/delete location suspense log 5.3.2.4.3.4.  Update warehouse location on electronic stock number directory or a working copy of detail record listing. 5.3.2.4.3.5.  Process location add or change (FCS). See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for processing instructions. 5.3.2.4.3.6.  Process  stock  number/detail  number  inquiry  to  verify  accurate  entry of warehouse location. 5.3.2.4.3.7.  Use  ES-S  Daily  FCS  capability  to  print  bin  labels  for  FCS transactions processed 0 - 7 days prior to the Start Date selected. 5.3.2.4.3.8.  Replace  temporary  bin  label  with  permanent  bin  label.  Update suspense log. 5.3.2.4.3.9.  Rejects.  When  the  warehouse  location  load/change/delete  request input rejects, correct the input and reprocess it, or take the action indicated by the reject. When the item record is frozen for inventory, forward a copy of the reject to  Inventory  personnel.  See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  7  for  details  on researching and processing rejects. 5.3.2.4.3.10.  Duplicate  Locations.  Once  a  warehouse  location  record  has  been assigned  to  an  NSN,  a  duplicate  location  record  will  not  be  allowed.  When  a location has already been assigned within a system designator, a reject notice will occur.  A  different  location  must  be  assigned  or  the  existing  record  must  be changed or deleted. 5.3.2.4.3.11.  Deleting  warehouse locations. When a warehouse location requires deletion;  ensure  the  location  does  not  contain  property  by  visually  checking location  and  processing  an  inquiry  to  ensure  serviceable  balance  is  zero.  If  no property  exists  in  location  or  on  serviceable  balance,  process  a  location  delete transaction with an “*” in cc 72 “Warehouse Location Delete Flag”. Refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for additional processing instructions. 5.3.2.4.3.11.1.  When  property  exists  in  location  and  serviceable  balance  is zero,  check  to  ensure  all  assets  have  been  pulled.  When  there  are  no  assets requiring  a  pull,  process  a  request  for  special  inventory.  Refer  to  Special Inventory  Interrogation  Input  (1GP)  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for additional information on request for special inventory. 5.3.2.4.3.12.  Warehouse  Locations  for  Unserviceable  Details.  All  unserviceable details  must  have  an  assigned  warehouse location load/change/delete  inputs  may  be  used  to  load  or  change  locations  on unserviceable  details.  All  location  loads/changes  will  be  maintained  in  suspense until  the location is  verified by its appearance on the Due-In  From Maintenance location.  Warehouse AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 157 Listing. 5.3.2.4.4.  Bin  Labels.  Bin  labels  will  be  attached  to  storage  racks,  bins,  or  bin subdivisions  (shelf,  box,  drawer,  etc.)  in  a  neat  and  uniform  manner.  Bin  labels  for outside storage locations should be at  strategic points in  the area (such as on corner markers  of  open  storage  bays).  Place  labels  for  outside  storage  on  permanent weatherproof  placards.  Bin  labels  are  not  required  for  unserviceable  warehouse location changes. 5.3.2.4.4.1.  Production of Bar-Coded Bin Labels. The HHT print Temporary Bin Labels  ES-S  warehouse  bin  label  function  provides  the  capability  to  print temporary warehouse bin labels on portable printers attached to HHTs (see ES-S User’s Manual for processing instructions). The ILS-S produces all bar-coded bin labels. Bar-coded bin labels cannot be created manually, regardless of the number required. 5.3.2.4.4.2.  Warehouse  personnel  may  request  new  warehouse  bin  labels  by preparing  a  warehouse  location  load/change/delete  (FCS)  input  transaction,  (see AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5)  or  through  the  Print  Warehouse  Bin  Label function in ES-S (see ES-S User’s Manual). 5.3.2.4.4.3.  Validation of Bin Label Data. Warehouse personnel validate all data on  the  bin  labels  by  comparing  the  data  on  the  label  with  the  data  on  output documents or bin notices. When the data on the bin label does not match the data on the document and the data on the bin label is not correct, process a request for a replacement label. 5.3.2.4.4.4.  Active  Storage  Locations  without  Bin  Labels.  When  warehouse personnel find a location with property but no bin label or an incorrect bin label, they  must  identify  the  proper  location.  Check  the  stock  number  directory  or process an inquiry to determine the correct location for the stock number. 5.3.2.4.4.4.1.  When  the  warehouse  location  is  correct  and  a  replacement  bin label  is  needed  prepare  a  warehouse  location  load/change/delete  (FCS)  input transaction, (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5) or through ES-S. 5.3.2.4.4.4.2.  When the inquiry rejects because the item record is not loaded, then a special inventory is required. When the inquiry rejects because the item record is not loaded, warehouse personnel will: 5.3.2.4.4.4.2.1.  Coordinate with Customer Support to load the item record. (T-3). 5.3.2.4.4.4.2.2.  Process a warehouse location change to assign location. (T-3). 5.3.2.4.4.4.3.  Process  a  request  for  special  inventory.  Refer  to  Special Inventory  Interrogation  Input  (1GP)  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for additional information on request for special inventory. (T-2). 5.3.3.  Special Storage Handling. 158 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.3.3.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  special  storage  handling  procedures  process.  For  policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.3.3.2.  Hazardous  commodities,  controlled  items,  cylinders,  electrostatic  discharge (ESD) and elastomeric material are among items where alternate or additional procedures for storage and handling are required. 5.3.3.3.  Hazardous Commodities. It is not possible to list all hazardous items that may be received  into  the  Supply  complex.  Therefore,  to  adequately  protect  life  and  property, materiel  management  processors  and  inspectors  must  be  alert  to  potentially  hazardous material received, stored, or issued. 5.3.3.3.1.  The  following  references  provide  guidance  for authorization, handling, tracking, and storage of hazardous commodities: the identification, 5.3.3.3.1.1.  FED-STD  313,  Material  Safety  Data,  Transportation  Data,  and Disposal  Data,  for  Hazardous  Materials  Furnished  to  Government  Activities, contain a list of FSCs that are likely to contain hazardous or radioactive materials. 5.3.3.3.1.2.  AFI  32-7086,  Hazardous  Materials  Management,  establishes  policy and  procedures  that  govern  the  identification,  tracking,  and  authorization  of certain  hazardous  materials  (  have  ),  as  defined  in  the  AFI.  It  applies  to  all  AF personnel who manage, authorize, procure, issue, use, or dispose of HAZMAT in the  course  of  their  official  duties,  whether  the  processes  are  performed  by government or contractor personnel. AFI 32-7086 is applicable to all installations, except where joint basing or international agreements require modified policy. It establishes  a  cross-functional  Hazardous  Materials  Management  Process (HMMP) team at each installation to assist with the identification, authorization, and management of HAZMAT. It requires the use of the Enterprise Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health Management Information System (EESOH-MIS) to track selected HAZMAT on the installation. the  authorized  use  for 5.3.3.3.1.2.1.

Customer  not  an  EESOH_MIS  authorized  user  must  obtain authorization  from  the  installation  HMMP  team  before  hazardous  material (HAZMAT) is issued IAW AFI 32-7086. (T-1). 5.3.3.3.1.3.  AFJMAN  23-209,  Storage  and  Handling  of  Hazardous  Material, provides  guidance the  control,  storage,  and  handling  of  hazardous commodities. in 5.3.3.3.1.4.  AFI  40-201,  Managing  Radioactive  Materials  in  the  US  Air  Force, sets forth how AF employees and activities acquire, receive, store, distribute, use, transfer,  or  dispose  of  any  item  or  part  that  contains  radioactive  material  not AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 159 expressly excluded by the AFI. 5.3.3.3.2.  Personnel  must  wear  the  proper  safety  clothing  and  equipment  when handling hazardous commodities. (T-2). 5.3.3.3.3.  Leakage  or  Spillage  of  Hazardous  Commodities.  Leakage  or  spillage  of hazardous commodities with a health, flammability and reactivity hazards rating of 0 or  1,  proceeded  by  an  asterisk  (*);  2,  3,  or  4  may  be  extremely  dangerous  to personnel.  If  leakage  or  spillage  should  occur,  contact  the  Civil  Engineer  Squadron (CES) and Base Safety Officer before cleaning up or disposing of the materiel. in identified 5.3.3.3.4.  The  materiel  management  procedures the  following paragraphs apply to  NSNs that have either a Hazardous Characteristic Code (HCC), an  Issue  Exception  (IEX)  Code  of  9,  or  are  included  in  an  FSC  listed  in  FED  STD 313.  NSNs  with  a  Health  Hazard  Approval  Flag  already  set  have  been  previously reviewed and exempted from IEX 9 coding by the installation HMMP team. Materiel management  personnel  may  receive  and  issue  health  hazard  approval  flagged materials  without  executing  the  following  procedures  and  without  tracking  the materials in EESOH-MIS. Material management personnel will assign the IEX Code 9 to materials that have been designated as a hazmat by the HMMP team and manage such material as indicated below and in AFI 32-7086. (T-1). 5.3.3.3.4.1.  Issue Transactions. Materiel management personnel will use EESOH-MIS  to  process  Hazmat  requests  to  verify  an  organization’s  hazardous  material authorization. (T-1). 5.3.3.3.4.1.1.  If the requesting shop is an approved user, the supply clerk will fulfill the supply transaction and ensure that the issue transaction is updated in EESOH-MIS IAW AFI 32-7086. (T-1). 5.3.3.3.4.1.2.  When  the  requesting  shop  is  not  an  approved  user  in  EESOH-MIS, the requesting shop will secure authorization through EESOH-MIS prior to issue. (T-1). 5.3.3.3.4.1.3.  When the requesting shop is not an approved user and the NSN is mission time-critical, follow local procedures or contact the HMMP team. Processing.  Materiel 5.3.3.3.4.2.  HAZMAT management  personnel  will  complete  the  following  actions  for  all  new requirements for Hazmat. (T-1). Authorization/Exemption 5.3.3.3.4.2.1.  When  the  HMMP  team  has  designated  the  NSN  material  as Hazmat that must be tracked in EESOH-MIS, update the record with an IEX 9 for subsequent tracking. (T-1). 5.3.3.3.4.2.2.  When  the  HMMP  team  has  exempted  the  material  from tracking  in  EESOH-MIS,  set  the  Health  Hazard  Approval  Flag.  This effectively ends any further tracking until rescinded by the HMMP team. (T-1). 5.3.3.3.4.3.  Logistics  Readiness  Squadrons  will  not  assign  “L”  and  “P”  (Non-Catalogued)  stock  numbers  for  hazardous  material  at  locations  using  EESOH-MIS.  for  hazardous  materials  authorization  and  tracking.

The  EESOH-MIS  data  stewards  will  use  the  following NSN  convention  when  assigning  hazardous  material  Stewarded  Local  Purchase stock  Numbers:  Position  1-4  will  be  populated  with  the  four-digit  federal  stock class.  Positions  5-7  will  be  populated  with  “PHM.”  Positions  8-15  will  be populated by a serialize number assigned by EESOH-MIS. 5.3.3.3.4.4.  Materiel  management  personnel  should  periodically  verify  that  the list  of  IEX  9  items  are  adequately  controlled  and  tracked  in  EESOH-MIS  and should  periodically  review  HCC  and  Fed  Std  313D  flagged  items  to  ensure continued HMMP exemption from authorization and tracking IAW AFI 32-7086. (T-1). 5.3.3.4.  Controlled  Items.  AF  activities  will  comply  with  guidance  in  DoDM  4140.01; DoDM  5200.01,  and  AFI  16-1404,  Air  Force  Information  Security  Program  regarding the  storage  of  controlled  materiel.  (T-1).    Procedures  apply  to  all  AF  activities  or agencies managing, issuing, receiving, storing, shipping or tracking AF owned controlled materiel; to include civilian, contractor, Air National Guard, and AF Reserve Component units. 5.3.3.4.1.  Designation.  AF  activities  will  formally  designate,  in  writing,  personnel authorized  to  handle,  or  accept  controlled  materiel  IAW  AFI  16-1404,  AFI  20-110 and other applicable directives. (T-1). 5.3.3.4.1.1.  Only  personnel  authorized  by  the  Commander  or  equivalent  are permitted  to  handle  and  accept  controlled  materiel  into  accountable  records systems.  Releasing  activities  will  verify  the  identification  of  an  individual  and their authorization to accept controlled materiel prior to signing for the materiel. 5.3.3.4.1.2.  Utilize  only  the  most  current  authorization  list(s)  of  individuals approved to handle, and accept controlled materiel. Maintain the source lists in a single  collection  point  to  manage  the  documents.  These  lists  are  updated  by Document  Control  or  Customer  Support  according  to  Sec  5D  -  Equipment Management. 5.3.3.4.1.3.  AF  activities  will  store  controlled  materiel  according  to  the  security classification and/or security risk or pilferage controls of the item. (T-1). 5.3.3.4.1.4.  AF  activities  will  ensure  controlled  inventory  items  are  safeguarded in appropriate storage facilities. (T-1). 5.3.3.4.1.5.  AF  activities  will  clearly  identify  the  item,  classification,  and  serial number (as appropriate) for all controlled materiel being stored. (T-1). 5.3.3.4.2.  AF  activities  will  manage  documentation  for  controlled  materiel  IAW disposition guidance found in AFI 16-1404. (T-1). 5.3.3.4.3.  AF  activities  will  stamp  or  mark  in  red  ink  each  document  and/or  label with  the  appropriate  item  classification  phrase  (i.e.,  "Classified  Item",  "Controlled Cryptographic Item", "CCI", "Sensitive Item", "Pilferable Item" ,"Classified NWRM Item") prior to the issue, receipt, turn-in, or shipment of controlled materiel. (T-1). 5.3.3.4.3.1.  Clearly  mark  NWRM  transitory  holding  and  unserviceable  storage AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 161 areas. Requirements for classified storage also apply. 5.3.3.4.3.2.  All NWRM must be segregated by condition code. (T-1). 5.3.3.4.4.  AF activities will annotate the item serial number of the physical asset onto all accountable documents. (T-1). 5.3.3.4.5.  AF activities will not requisition or transport AF owned controlled materiel outside  of  normal  Military  Standard  Requisitioning  and Issue  Procedures (MILSTRIP).  All  AF  activities  will  coordinate  acquisition,  utilization,  and transportation  requirements  for  AF  owned  controlled  materiel  with  authorized activities. (T-1). 5.3.3.4.6.  AF  activities  will  provide  training  to  affected  personnel  in  regards  to  all DoD  and  AF  policies  to  be  followed  in  managing,  issuing,  receiving,  storing, shipping  or  tracking  controlled  materiel.  AF  activities  will  conduct  training  to maintain  awareness  and  competence  regarding  proper  management  of  controlled materiel and will document all training in formal training records. (T-1). 5.3.3.4.7.  AF activities will stamp or mark in red each copy of Top Secret, Secret and Confidential  documents  with  the  phrase  "CLASSIFIED  ITEM"  prior  to  the  issue, receipt, return, or shipment of classified material. (T-1). 5.3.3.5.  Cylinders.  This  paragraph  describes  the  general  procedures  for  the  control  of government- or vendor-owned cylinders/containers. 5.3.3.5.1.  Government-Owned  Cylinders.  Cylinders  are  used  to  store  warehouse stock of compressed gases. Each government-owned gas cylinder will be assigned a national stock number (NSN), L or P stock number. 5.3.3.5.1.1.  Tagging  Cylinders'  Condition.  Inspection  personnel  indicate  the condition of the cylinders by attaching tags or labels as specified in TO 42B5-1-2, Gas Cylinders (Storage Type) Use, Handling, and Maintenance. 5.3.3.5.1.2.  Exchanging Cylinders. Customers may exchange empty cylinders for full ones on a one-for-one basis. No transaction against the cylinder item record is necessary for an exchange. 5.3.3.5.1.3.  Issuing  Cylinders  without  an  Exchange.  When  a  customer  has  a requirement for gas but does not have an empty cylinder immediately available, a full cylinder will be issued. 5.3.3.5.1.4.  Refilling/Repairing  Empty  Cylinders.  Warehouse  personnel  ship  or issue cylinders to vendors for refill or repair. 5.3.3.5.1.5.  Customer  Pre-inspection.  When  mutually  agreed to  between LRS\Materiel  Management  Activity  and  the  customer,  the  LRS  CC/AO  has  the option  to  allow  customers  to  pre-inspect  and  accept  delivery  of  compressed  gas cylinders  at  the  LRS\Materiel  Management  Activity  storage  point.  When  this option is used, the customer physically inspects the cylinders for any defects and, if  not  defective,  transports  them  from  the  LRS\Materiel  Management  Activity storage  point  to  their  organization  site.  This  method  reduces  delays  that  may result  when  defective  cylinders  are  delivered  by  LRS\Materiel  Management 162 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Activity to the customer site. When this option is used, it is the responsibility of the customer to return empty cylinders to the supply storage point. 5.3.3.5.2.  Controlling Vendor-Owned Cylinders or Containers. When issuing vendor-owned cylinders or containers, Central Storage personnel will prepare AF Form 1297, Temporary  Issue  Receipt.  The  AF  Form  1297  will  be  signed  by  the  organization receiving the contents of the cylinders or containers. Central Storage will maintain the signed form in a suspense file until the cylinders or containers have been returned to the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity.  Warehouse  personnel  will  prepare  and process  updates  to  vendor-owned  container  detail  records  (See  Vendor  Owned Container Detail Record Update – 1VR in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) upon issue of filled containers and when empty containers are returned. (T-2). 5.3.3.6.  Electrostatic  Discharge  (ESD).  Inspection  will  ensure  ESD  items  are  properly marked/labeled and a type cargo code (TCC) 3 is stored on the item record. (T-1).When physical  inspection  indicates  ESD  marking/labeling  with  TCC  other  than  3,  handle  the item  as  ESD  sensitive  and  submit  a  message  or  letter  to  the  Transportation  Manager  at the Air Logistics Complex (ALC) managing that particular item. To inquire if an item is truly TCC 3, send all requests to Robins AFB Type Cargo Code Challenges. 5.3.3.6.1.  Serviceability  Checks.  When  the  serviceability  of  an  ESD  item  is questionable, inspection personnel will issue the item to maintenance for a functional check.  (T-2).  Never  use  staples  or  any  kind  of  metal  fasteners  to  attach documentation to ESD property. 5.3.3.7.  Elastomeric Materiel. Elastomeric items  will be managed using first-in/first-out (FIFO)  procedures.  For  example,  materiel  with  a  use  by  date  of  1  Jan  2012  should  be placed  in  front,  on  top,  etc.,  of  items  with  a  use  by  date  of  1  May  2013.  When  issuing property, select the items with the closest use by date first. When materiel does not have a use  by  date,  then  select  the  items  with  the  oldest  date  received  stamped/printed  on  the package/container. Exception: Issue the newest item to fill RSP kits. 5.3.3.8.  Controlled  Inventory  Items  Codes  (CIIC)  as  Highest  Sensitivity  (Category  I)  –Arms, Ammunition and Explosives with a physical security classification of Secret (CIIC 5),  High  Sensitivity  (Category  II)  –  Arms,  Ammunition  and  Explosives.  (CIIC  6),  and High  Sensitivity  (Category  II)  –  Arms,  Ammunition  and  Explosives  with  a  physical security  classification of Confidential  (CIIC 8)  will be stored and transported  IAW AFI 16-1404,  DoDM  5100.76,  Physical  Security  of  Sensitive  Conventional  Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives (AA&E) or DoDM 5100.76, V3 whichever is more stringent. 5.3.3.9.  Small  Arms  weapon  components,  such  as  silencers,  mufflers  and  noise suppression  devices  will  be  treated  as  Category  II  items.  (Reference:  DoDM  5100.76, V3). 5.3.3.10.  Small Arms major subparts, such as frame(s) and receiver(s), will be treated as Category II items. (Reference: DoDM 5100.76). 5.3.3.11.  Barrels  and  Major  Subassemblies  will  be  protected  as  Category  IV  Arms. (Reference: DoDM 5100.76). AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 163 5.3.3.12.  Generally, only arms, rockets, explosive rounds, mines and projectiles that have an unpackaged weight of 100 pounds or less shall be categorized as sensitive. (Reference: DoDM 5100.76). 5.3.3.13.  The following is a list of sensitive items that require a high degree of protection and physical inventory control. The DoD components are expected to include additional items determined to require a similar degree of control: 5.3.3.13.1.  Drug abuse items. 5.3.3.13.2.  Precious metals. 5.3.3.13.3.

Missiles and rockets (unpacked weight of 60 pounds or less). 5.3.3.13.5.16.  End items of conventional and guided missile ammunition (except artillery  rounds,  bombs,  and  torpedoes)  which  have  potential  use  in  civil disturbances and are vulnerable to theft. 5.3.4.  Warehouse Storage Location Validation. 5.3.4.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  warehouse  storage  location  validation  procedures.  For policy  specific  requirements  refer  to  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  refer  to AFH 23-123. 5.3.4.2.  The  accurate  storage  and  control  of  assets  is  essential  to  inventory  control  and accuracy. Warehouse location validations are conducted to: 1) verify the asset is stored in the warehouse location stated on item record 2) ensure all records indicating a serviceable balance are assigned a warehouse location, and 3) identify those records having duplicate warehouse locations. 5.3.4.3.  Warehouse Validation Schedule. Warehouse personnel are required to prepare a warehouse  location  validation  schedule  each  fiscal  year  to  ensure  all  assigned  locations are  validated  annually.  Note:  Do  NOT  count  balances  when  conducting  annual validations. 5.3.4.3.1.  Scheduling  Warehouse  Location  Validations.  The  validation  program  is scheduled and performed based on the location of items in the warehouse (warehouse location  sequence).  Additional  validation  selections  are  provided  to  fulfill  the requirements  of  local  management  (example  classified,  sensitive,  pilferable).  These additional selections do not satisfy the normal requirements for validation. 5.3.4.3.2.  Coordination of Activities. The LRS CC/AO will ensure Inventory Section and warehouse personnel coordinate closely during the preparation of the warehouse location validation and inventory schedules. (T-1). The storage activity will complete scheduled validations 10 workdays prior to the start of an inventory cycle. (T-1). 5.3.4.3.3.  Copies  of  the  Location  Validation  Schedule.  The  NCOIC  of  the  Asset Management  Section  will  receive  copies  of  the  warehouse  location  validation schedule from each warehouse activity assigned to Asset Management and provide to the  appropriate  stock  rooms,  Inventory  section,  and  other  section/element(s)  as required.  All  recipients  of  the  warehouse  location  validation  schedule  will  retain  it until replaced by or superseded with a new schedule. (T-2). 5.3.4.3.4.  Satellite Accounts. The warehouse location validation for satellite accounts is  scheduled  and  conducted  by  warehouse  personnel  responsible  for  their  respective satellite accounts. 5.3.4.4.  Validation  File  Listing.  ES-S  Warehouse  Management,  Location  Validation function is the primary IT tool for validations. One day before the start of the validation, AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 165 warehouse  personnel  will  request  the  warehouse  validation  listing  using  applicable  IT system. Refer to ES-S User’s Manual for the parameter format. The Warehouse Location Validation program writes images to a location-validation database and prints the images on the Validation File Listing in warehouse location sequence. 5.3.4.5.  Warehouse  Location  Validation  Processing.  Warehouse  personnel  compare  the stock number displayed on the bin label with the stock number on the property tag of the item  in  the  bin  location.  Note:  Warehouse  personnel  will  open  all  containers  for controlled  materiel  (NWRM,  classified,  sensitive,  and  pilferable)  and  physically  verify that the item  matches the stock number on the property tag and bin  label. Materiel in  a location  must  be  identified/tagged.  Refer  to  AFI  23-101  for  specific  marking/tagging guidance. (T-1). 5.3.4.6.  Processing Warehouse Location Validation Discrepancies. 5.3.4.6.1.  Stock  number  on  property  does  not  match  stock  number  listed  on  the  bin label. Warehouse personnel will take the following actions: 5.3.4.6.1.1.  Process  a  stock  number  inquiry  in  the  applicable  IT  system  to determine if location exists and was accidently put in the wrong location. Note: If applicable  IT systems  are unavailable  you can research using the Stock  Number User  Directory  (SNUD),  warehouse  location  change  suspense  files,  or  the  Daily Document Register. 5.3.4.6.1.1.1.  If warehouse location is assigned, then move to correct location. 5.3.4.6.1.1.2.  If  warehouse  location  is  not  assigned,  process  a  warehouse location change (FCS) to assign one. Refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for processing instructions. 5.3.4.6.1.1.3.  When the inquiry indicates a zero (0) balance, prepare a request for  special  inventory.  Enter  the  location  of  the  property  on  the  request,  and then  forward  it  to  the  Inventory  Section,  see  Special  Inventory  Interrogation Input (1GP) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the format. 5.3.4.6.1.1.4.  When the inquiry rejects because the item record is not loaded, warehouse personnel will get with Customer Support to load the item record, then  process  a  warehouse  location  change  to  assign  location,  and  finally process a request for special inventory. 5.3.4.7.  Stock  in  bin/location  for  which  no  warehouse  location  has  been  assigned. Warehouse  personnel  first  check  the  warehouse  location  change  suspense  file  and  the “Serviceable  Balance  -  No  Location”  Listing  to  see  if  a  warehouse  location  is  being loaded. 5.3.4.7.1.  When a location is being loaded, prepare a slip to indicate the bin has been validated. 5.3.4.7.2.  When  the  locator  file  indicates  another  location,  move  the  stock  to  the proper location. 166 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.3.4.7.3.  When  you cannot  resolve the problem  using either of the methods above, then  prepare  a  request  for  special  inventory.  Annotate  the  location  on  the  inventory request, and place a copy in the bin. 5.3.4.8.  Zero Balance/Zero Demand Level Listing. A listing of locations assigned to item records  with  a  zero  (0)  serviceable  balance,  a  zero  (0)  demand  level,  and  date  of  last transaction  (DOLT)  equal  to  or  greater  than  30  days,  will  be  requested  using  the appropriate option. Note: Program control will not select “dead” locations with the above conditions when any of the following detail records are linked to the item record:  Due-in detail,  due-in  from  maintenance  detail,  due-in  from  maintenance  (DIFM)  unserviceable detail,  supply  point  detail,  war  reserve  materiel  (WRM)/  in  place  readiness  spares package  (IRSP)  spares  detail,  and  WRM/war  consumables  distribution  objective  (WCDO)  spares  detail.  Warehouse  personnel  will  physically  verify  each  location identified on the list to ensure the location is empty. (T-2). 5.3.4.8.1.  When the location is empty, warehouse personnel may delete the location. See  Warehouse  Location  Load/Change/Delete  (FCS)  input  transaction  in  AFH  23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for specific ILS-S information and processing. Remove the bin label from the location after the location has been deleted. 5.3.4.8.2.  When any stock remains in the bin, process a request for special inventory and forward it to Inventory. 5.3.4.9.  Serviceable  Balances  with  No  Warehouse  Location.  ES-S  Warehouse Management,  Location  Validation  function  is  the  primary  IT  tool  for  managing serviceable  balances  with  no  location.  See  the  ES-S  User’s  Manual  or  refer  to  for  the Serviceable  Balance  No  Location  Listing.  This  listing  is  used  to  identify  items  having serviceable  balance  but  no  warehouse  location  and  a  date  of  last  transaction  (DOLT) greater than 3 days. 5.3.4.9.1.  Warehouse  personnel  will  request  this  listing  daily  to  ensure  items  that appear  on  the  listing  are  being  worked  in  a  timely  manner.  (T-2).  Items  will  not appear on the listing for no more than 5 duty days unless under special circumstances. 5.3.5.  Warehouse Change Documents. 5.3.5.1.  Purpose: To explain warehouse change document procedures process. For policy specific requirements refer to AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123. 5.3.5.2.  Certain ILS-S transactions will automatically cause the generation of warehouse change  documents.  These  transactions  are  item  record  indicative  data  changes,  unit  of issue changes, and controlled item code changes. 5.3.5.3.  Processing  Warehouse  Change  Documents.  Transactions  that  will  cause  the automatic generation of a warehouse change document are: 5.3.5.3.1.  Item Record Indicative Data Changes. When an item record indicative data change  input  changes  a  stock  number,  system  designator,  or  ERRCD.  Note:  A warehouse change document will NOT be produced when the FIC input changes only the  last  two  positions  of  the  national  stock  number  (positions  14-15).  It  is,  NOT necessary  to  keep  positions  14-15  of  the  national  stock  number  current  on  external AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 167 tags,  bin  labels,  etc.  The  13-digit  national  stock  number  is  the  basis  for  ILS-S transactions on these items. 5.3.5.3.2.  Unit of Issue Changes. Refer to Warehouse Change Document in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for the output format. 5.3.5.3.3.  Controlled Item Code Changes. Refer to Warehouse Change Document in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for the output format. 5.3.5.4.  Receipt  of  Warehouse  Change  Documents.  Warehouse  personnel  must  process warehouse change documents as quickly as possible. Upon receipt of warehouse change documents, warehouse personnel will do the following: 5.3.5.4.1.  Update  Labels,  Tags,  and  Listings.  Change  the  applicable  data  on  bin labels, property tags, locator listing (Stock Number Directory), etc. 5.3.5.4.1.1.  Shelf  Life  and  Issue  Exception  Code  Changes.  The  ILS-S  program control  prints  the  shelf  life  code  and  issue  exception  code.  When  applicable, warehouse personnel will use this data to update external files. 5.3.5.4.1.2.  Unit  of  Issue  Change  affecting  zero  balances.  When  a  unit  of  issue change  results  in  a  zero  balance  (i.e.  EA  changed  to  DZ)  and  there  is  an insufficient  quantity  on  hand  (5  EA  to  0  DZ)  to  show  a  balance,  warehouse personnel must coordinate with Customer Support to decide if the item is critical or in short supply locally. When plausible local management may choose create a "-1" NSN and adjust records to reflect the appropriate quantity). 5.3.5.4.2.  Relocate Property. Relocation may be necessary when the following occur: 5.3.5.4.2.1.  Changed  Controlled  Item  Code.  The  Materiel  Management  Flight Commander  or  Superintendent  must  approve  any  relocation  of  the  property caused  by  controlled  item  code  changes  by  signing  the  warehouse  change document.  (T-1).When  changing  from  classified  to  unclassified,  warehouse personnel  must  verify  the  change  to  the  controlled  item  code  originated  through the  stock  number  user  directory  (SNUD).  (T-1).  When  the  change  did  not originate  through  SNUD,  warehouse  personnel  process  a  controlled  item  code change  input  to  reinstate  the  previous  controlled  item  code  stated  on  the warehouse  change  document.  When  the  change  was  received  through  SNUD,  it should  be  valid.  When  the  Materiel  Management  Flight  Commander  or Superintendent  believes  the  change  compromises  security,  warehouse  personnel immediately  ask  Customer  Support  to  validate  the  controlled  item  codes.  In  the meantime, the property remains in secure storage. 5.3.5.4.2.2.  Consolidating Stock Numbers/Unit of Issue. When warehouse change documents  require  consolidation  due  to  stock  number  merge  or  unit  of  issue conversions.  Ensure  material  correctly  matches  quantity  and  stock  number changes. 5.3.5.4.3.  Coordinate  with  Inspection.  Coordinate  with  Inspection  when  property requires inspection. 5.3.5.4.4.  DD Form 1348-1A. Initial and date block 27 of the DD Form 1348-1A and then forward the original to Document Control. 168 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.3.5.5.  Daily Document Register. The Daily Document Register contains entries for 1) inputs  that  recorded  a  deleted  warehouse  location  against  the  item  record,  and  2)  item record indicative data  changes, unit of issue changes, and  controlled item  code  changes that recorded an unserviceable detail record for an item. 5.3.5.5.1.  Daily  warehouse  personnel  must  verify  the  Daily  Document  Register  for transactions. (T-2). 5.3.5.5.1.1.  Deleted  Item  Record  Entries  on  the  Daily  Document  Register. Deleted  item  record  entries  on  the  Daily  Document  Register  are  arranged sequentially by location. Central Storage personnel must verify all locations.  (T-2). 5.3.5.5.1.2.  When  the  location  is  empty,  remove  or  obliterate  the  bin  label  and crossout the corresponding entry on the locator listing. 5.3.5.5.1.3.  When  the  location  contains  property,  prepare  a  request  for  special inventory  and  forward  it  to  Inventory.  Enter  the  location  of  the  property  on  the request for special inventory but do not cross out the corresponding entry on the locator listing (although this may be annotated to indicate that the item record was deleted). 5.3.5.5.2.  Item  record indicative data changes, unit of issue changes, and controlled item  code  changes  that  recorded  an  unserviceable  detail  record.  They  are  arranged sequentially by document number, which will have activity code R, organization code 920,  and  shop  code  RW.  Entries  indicate  changes  to  stock  number,  system designators,  and/or  ERRCD,  changes  to  controlled  item  code,  or  changes  to  unit  of issue. Refer to procedures listed in this section. 5.3.5.5.3.  Destroy  daily  document  register  once  all  actions  have  been  completed.

IPE  will  establish  a  single  site  name  for  wing  assets.  Bases  with multiple MAJCOMs  will establish a separate site for each MAJCOM within the Mobility IT system. (T-2). 5.3.6.3.16.2.  Each  individual  site  will  consist  of  a  site  name,  MAJCOM  Site name,  DoDAAC,  Shipping  Address,  Site  POC,  Email,  Duty  Phone  and  Military Position Number (MPN). 5.3.6.3.16.3.  Line  item  authorizations  are  loaded  in  accordance  with  tariff  sized authorizations  within  the  Site  Administration  table  in  the  mobility  IT  system. Refer to the mobility IT system user’s guide for load procedures. 5.3.6.3.16.4.  Collaborate  indicative  data  changes  (e.g.  Shelf-life,  identity,  stock class  change,  etc.)  to  the  Mobility  IT  system  with  base-level  inspectors,  as appropriate, to validate correct information is reflected in the system. 5.3.6.3.17.  IPE Element personnel must take corrective action on all the mobility IT system errors. (T-1). This will foster accurate accountability. 5.3.6.3.18.  The  Mobility  IT  System  is  mandatory  for  all  record  maintenance  of serviceable IPE assets unless otherwise excluded in guidance. 5.3.7.  Supply Point Management. 5.3.7.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  supply  point  unique  management  procedures.  For  policy specific requirements, review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance AFH 23-123. 5.3.7.2.  Supply Points are additional warehouses located within or next to the supported activities. 5.3.7.3.  Supply Point Establishment/Change Requests. 5.3.7.3.1.  Organizations  desiring  to  establish  and/or  change  a  supply  point  must submit  a  list  of  requested  items  to  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity,  Flight Service Center (FSC) element. This list shall include the following item information: stock number, part number, nomenclature, end item application (i.e., weapon system, end item, or equipment), quantity desired, and identify if functional check is required for the assets. The following items are authorized on a supply point: 5.3.7.3.1.1.  Any item of supply, except for equipment items (ERRCD ND*/NF*) and items assigned Numeric Parts Preference Codes (NPPC) 4 or 9. 5.3.7.3.1.2.  Buildup  items.  The  individual  XD2/XF*  components  of  buildup items  will  be  identified  and  accounted  for  separately  on  supply  point  detail records.  Expendable  items  (XB3)  required  for  a  buildup  item  do  not  need  to  be accounted for separately. Expendable items can be obtained by submitting normal issue requests. 5.3.7.3.1.3.  Launch kits. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 175 5.3.7.3.2.  Once  an  item  is  selected  for  addition,  all  authorized  interchangeable (substitute) items must also be stocked in the supply point. 5.3.7.3.3.  Upon  receipt  of  the  supply  point  establishment/change  request,  the  FSC will: 5.3.7.3.3.1.  Verify only  authorized items  have been requested  (reference Supply Point Management). (T-1). 5.3.7.3.3.2.  Determine  authorized  quantity  amounts.  (T-1).  The  quantity  of  an item stocked in a supply point is based upon the demand data of the organizations using  the  supply  point  (except  for  XB3  items).  Items  used  by  more  than  one organization  can  be  stocked  in  a  supply  point;  however,  care  must  be  taken  to ensure all base users are adequately supported. 5.3.7.3.3.2.1.  Sole Users. When only one organization uses the item, the total authorization  of  the  base’s  operating  stock  may  be  kept  at  the  supply  point (when  space  allows).  In  this  case,  supply  point  personnel  will  receive,  store, and issue property in the same manner as central storage personnel. 5.3.7.3.3.2.2.  Multiple Users. When there is  more than one user of the item, only a portion of the base’s operating stock will be stored in the supply point for each supported organization. In this case, the balance maintained in  each supply point will be recorded on a supply point detail for each organization. 5.3.7.3.3.3.  Verify supply point requests are supported by positive Requisitioning Objectives (RO). (T-1). This can be accomplished by processing individual item record inquiries or a LIMS-EV script to ascertain base asset position. When RO is insufficient  to  support  supply  point  request,  the  FSC  direct  the  customer  to prepare and submit an ASL. Failure to submit the ASL could delay supply point support.  See  Sec  2B  for  ASL  request  submission  instructions.  Non-Airborne Communications-Electronics  (C-E)  XD2  items  (to  include  space,  weather  and missile system assets) do not  require the documented request  for a special level. See  Sec.  2B,  for  procedures  on  establishing  Low  Density  Levels  for  C-E  XD2 items. 5.3.7.3.3.4.  Forward  supply  point  requests  which  include  Economic  Order Quantity  (EOQ)  items  (ERRCD  XB3)  to  the  Materiel  Management  Flight Commander for approval. (T-1). 5.3.7.3.3.5.  For all new  supply point establishment  requests, coordinate addition of a new delivery destination record with the Customer Support Liaison Element. Shop  codes  for  all  supply  point  activities  must  have  a  corresponding  delivery destination  record  loaded  to  ensure  correct  delivery.  For  supply  point  activities not located on the supporting base or satellite, the off-base indicator must be used when  loading  a  delivery  destination.  When  this  indicator  is  used,  the  ILS-S produces  a  transportation  copy  of  issue  or  release  document.  The  off-base indicator  will  be  blank  for  those  activities  serviced  by  the  supporting  base  or satellite Documented Cargo. See Delivery Destination Record Load, Change, Or Delete  (1DE)  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  8  for  delivery  destination  input format and processing procedures. 176 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.3.7.3.3.6.  Add/change/delete Supply Point Detail Records. Assets maintained in supply points will be accounted for and controlled on supply point detail records. See Supply Point Detail  Load/Change/Delete/Inquiry (FSP) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for specific ILS-S information and processing. 5.3.7.3.3.7.  Submit  requests  to  produce  the  Supply  Point  Listing  and  bin  labels. (T-3).  See Supply Point Listing (Q13/NGV875) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5  for  specific  ILS-S  information  and  processing  instructions.  For  specific information on bin labels, refer to the ES-S User’s Manual. Provide a copy of the listing  and  bin  labels  to  the  supply  point  monitor.  Maintain  one  copy  of  the Supply Point Listing in the FSC. 5.3.7.4.  Asset  Accountability.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  maintains accountability of assets in supply points in the appropriate ILS-S. 5.3.7.4.1.  The  supported  organization’s  supply  point  monitor  is  responsible  for  the overall  management  and  control  for  those  supply  point  within  their  possession,  to include:  assist  LRS\Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  during  scheduled inventories,  maintain  supply  discipline  when  ordering  assets  from  the  supply  point, ensuring assets in supply points are serviceable inventories, and provide secure space and facilities to store supply point assets. 5.3.7.5.  Stocking and Replenishing Supply Points. 5.3.7.5.1.  Issues (Transfers) to Supply Points. The issue of stock to a Supply Point is a transfer of stock from one warehouse location to another. No usage or demand data will  be  updated.  When  Supply  Points  are  established  and/or  changed,  the  issue interface can be used to automatically request transfers of stock to the Supply Point. Standard  issue  (transfer)  procedures  outlined  in  Customer  Issue  Request  (ISU/MSI) Transaction  Mark-For  Field  Data  Requirements  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5 will be used to replenish supply points. 5.3.7.5.2.  Issues  From  Supply  Points.  All  issues  from  a  supply  point  are  over-the counter.  When  a  demand  is  placed  on  the  supply  point  and  the  item  is  available, supply  point  personnel  will  select  the  item  from  the  location  and  prepare  an  MSI request.  If  ILS-S  access  is  available  at  the  supply  point,  the  MSI  document  will  be returned  to  the  input  terminal  so  the  recipient's  signature  can  be  obtained.  Supply points  operating  without  an  ILS-S  terminal  (or  with  an  inoperable  terminal)  will prepare MSI requests as degraded operations. The supply point monitor will forward all documentation to  the FSC for processing and to  ensure proper document control actions are taken. (T-2). See Issue From Detail Record (MSI) Processing Instructions and Transaction Format  in  AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt  1, Ch 5 for detailed supply point processing and documentation preparation. 5.3.7.5.3.  Turn  Around  Processing  In  Lieu  of  Issue  Requests.  Turn  around procedures may be used in lieu of processing issue requests to record demand data for fast moving items in supply points. When turnaround procedures are used, the supply point  detail  Date  Of  Last  Transaction  (DOLT)  is  not  updated.  See  Maintenance Turnaround Processing in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 4 for turnaround processing AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 177 and  T.O.  00-20-3,  Maintenance  Processing  of  Reparable  Property  and  the  Repair Cycle Asset Control System for additional information, for additional information. 5.3.7.6.  Transfers of Items between Supply Points. One supply point may issue items to another. First, a return (TRIC TIN with TEX code 8) from the losing supply point must be  processed  to  prevent  due-outs  from  being  released.  See  Recoverable  Item  Turn-In Request (TIN) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6 for return processing. Secondly, a forced due-out release (TRIC DOR with TEX code 3) will be processed with the gaining supply point’s due-out. See Forced Due-Out Release (DOR) Input Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 5.3.7.7.  Returns  to  a  Supply  Point  from  Maintenance.  Returns  (TRIC  TIN)  to  a  supply point from maintenance will be completed, see Recoverable Item Turn-In Request (TIN) as  outlined  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  6.  Supply  points  will  only  accept  returns when the property is serviceable and required to satisfy existing due-outs. 5.3.7.8.  Supply Point Reconciliation. 5.3.7.8.1.  Semiannual  reconciliations  of  all  supply  points  are  mandatory.  More frequent reconciliations are recommended when warranted by the volume of changes. One  of  the  semiannual  reconciliations  will  be  accomplished  at  the  same  time  as  the annual  supply  point  inventory.  See  Sec.  5G,  for  more  information  on  inventorying supply points. Reference AFI 21-101 for additional information. 5.3.7.8.2.  A  Supply  Point  Listing  will  be  used  to  perform  the  reconciliation.  See Supply Point Listing (Q13/NGV875), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5. The supported supply monitor(s) will perform a physical count to verify the balances. All items and requirements on the listing will be verified, to include: 5.3.7.8.2.1.  Balance Discrepancies. When the physical on-hand balance does not match the quantities on the Supply Point Listing, discrepancies will be reconciled according to the inventory procedures in Sec. 5G. 5.3.7.8.2.2.  Verified  Excesses.  The  supply  point  monitor  will  complete  an  AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-In Request, and return verified excesses to the FSC. 5.3.7.8.2.3.  Items Less than the Authorization. When the reconciliation shows the total  items  are  less  than  the  authorization  plus  due-outs,  the  FSC  will  verify  the RO is still sufficient to support the supply point’s authorized quantity. When RO is sufficient, FSC will process issue requests to establish due-outs or create issue release.  The  FSC  may  use  the  issue  transactions  produced  by  the  Supply  Point Listing  or  manually  process  issues.  If  RO  is  not  sufficient  to  support  authorized quantity, procedures in this manual. Supply Point Management will be followed; or  assets  will  be  returned  to  FSC  and  supply  detail  reduced  for  discrepant quantity. 5.3.7.9.  Operating Supply Points with Buildup Items. 5.3.7.9.1.  Transaction  Notification.  Each  time  a  buildup  item  (or  components)  is removed from the supply point to replace a like item (removed from an end item), the organization  responsible  for  the  supply  point  items  will  notify  the  LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  of  the  transaction.  An  issue  from  the  supply  point  or  a 178 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 turnaround  will  be  processed  for  each  component.  When  issue  procedures  are  used, demand code R or N will be used to establish DIFM accountability. 5.3.7.9.2.  Clear  the  DIFM.  After  the  item  is  restored  (repaired  and  built  up)  by Maintenance,  the  asset  will  be  placed  back  in  the  supply  point’s  stock  and  a paperwork  return  (TRIC  TIN)  for  each  component  will  be  processed  to  clear  the outstanding DIFM details. 5.3.7.9.2.1.  After the return is processed, a paperwork transfer to the supply point will be processed to reduce the serviceable on-hand balance and restore the supply point on-hand balance. 5.3.7.9.2.2.  When the item is returned to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity for  Not  Reparable  This  Station  (NRTS)/condemned  action,  normal  DIFM  return procedures will apply. See Ch 4 and 6 for more information. 5.3.7.9.3.  MICAP  Requirements  for  Buildup  Items.  Supply  points  will  release buildup  items  to  satisfy  the  MICAP  requirement  of  another  activity  when  no  other items are available to satisfy the redistribution order and AFMC directs the shipment. Maintenance  personnel  will  ensure  the  item  is  broken  down  (into  separate components) prior to release. 5.3.7.9.4.  LRS-Operated  Buildup  Supply  Points.  When the  LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  manages  the  buildup  supply  point  (instead  of  Maintenance), short term (10 days or less) hand receipts will be used to control the items while they are  physically  in  Maintenance  undergoing  buildup.  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity will coordinate with Maintenance to minimize the amount of time an item is in buildup. When hand receipts are in excess of 10 days, conduct a daily revalidation with Maintenance until they are cleared. Do not use DIFM procedures to control the items during buildup because they will cause erroneous ILS-S reporting. 5.3.8.  Selecting Assets for Issue, Shipment, or Transfer (Normal, Warehouse Refusal,  Zero Balance Validation). 5.3.8.1.  Purpose: To explain how to select assets for an issue, shipment, or transfer. For policy  specific  requirements  refer  to  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  refer  to AFH 23-123. 5.3.8.2.  When  a  request  will  be  satisfied  by  assets  that  are  in  stock,  a  movement document will be produced. Warehouse personnel will take immediate action to move the assets from stock for delivery to the customer or cargo movement. 5.3.8.3.  Selecting  Property  for  Issue.  Take  the  following  steps  to  ensure  that  correct property is selected: 5.3.8.3.1.  Go to the location indicated on the movement document/label or prompted on Asset Mgt HHT. 5.3.8.3.2.  Ensure the bin label matches the information on the issue document and/or use Asset Mgt HHT to scan/enter bin label data. 5.3.8.3.2.1.  Ensure  that  the  stock  number  and  unit  of  issue  on  the  property  are correct and/or use Asset Mgt HHT to scan/enter NSN and Unit of Issue data. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 179 5.3.8.3.2.2.  For  Shelf-life  and  Elastomeric  items,  select  the  oldest  dated  item  in location to ensure proper stock rotation. Exception are issue to Readiness Spares Packages, select the newest dated item. 5.3.8.3.3.  Select the quantity indicated on the document and/or use Asset Mgt HHT to scan/enter quantity selected. 5.3.8.3.4.  Ensure  issue  exception  processing  is  accomplished  when  applicable.  For example,  random  length  (IEX  code  4  –  sheet  metal,  tubing,  fabric,  etc.)  sometimes requires quantities to be issued in one continuous length. 5.3.8.3.5.  Sign and date block 22 of the movement document to show that you pulled the  property  and/or  a  completed  pull  using  Asset  Mgt  HHT  documents  the  same action. 5.3.8.3.6.  Use Asset Mgt HHT to annotate the movement of the property for delivery to the customer. 5.3.8.3.7.  Move the property and document for delivery to the customer. 5.3.8.4.  Asset  Selection  Problems.  The  two  most  common  problems  that  may  occur when  assets  are  being  selected  from  stock  are:  1)  the  warehouse  location  stated  on  a document  is  either  empty  or  does  not  contain  sufficient  assets  to  fill  the  request;  2) documents indicate the on-hand balance was reduced to zero but assets remain in stock. 5.3.8.4.1.  Warehouse  Refusals.  A  warehouse  refusal  occurs  when  the  warehouse location stated on an issue or shipment document is either empty or does not contain enough quantity to fill the request. In this situation, take the following steps to ensure the item is not misplaced in the warehouse: 5.3.8.4.1.1.  Fill the request from a reserve location (if applicable). 5.3.8.4.1.2.  Check adjacent locations to see if the item might have fallen into the adjacent location or was stored in the wrong location. 5.3.8.4.1.3.  Check the same and adjacent locations in the bin rows on each side of the one stated on the issue/shipment document. 5.3.8.4.1.4.  Check  the  locator  listing  and  FCS  suspense  file  for  a  possible warehouse location change. 5.3.8.4.1.5.  Process a CTH inquiry to check for recent transactions (i.e. receipts, returns,  location  changes).  Check  “Not  Put  Away”  reports,  Inbound  Cargo, Inspection,  and  the  Flight  Service  Center  to  determine  the  location  of  missing property. 5.3.8.4.1.6.  When  the  assets  are  still  not  found,  notify  the  warehouse  or stockroom supervisor. Supervisors will take action to verify the item is missing by repeating  all  of  the  above  procedures.  When  the  assets  are  still  not  found  the warehouse or stockroom supervisor will: 5.3.8.4.1.6.1.  Process the pull in the HHT and enter a quantity of “zero” and Click  “Deny”  in  the  Asset  Mgt  Warehouse  Refusal  Report,  these  steps  will freeze the items record and move the Asset Mgt Record to history and update 180 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 the Temporary Location with “Moved to history. Reason: Warehouse Refusal Denied”.  When  not  using  Asset  Mgt,  then  stamp  all  copies  of  the label/document  WAREHOUSE  REFUSAL  (using  1/2  inch  block  letters  and red  ink),  sign  copy  1  across  the  stamp,  and  write  ASSIGN  TEX  Code  “P” beneath the stamp on the first copy. 5.3.8.4.1.6.2.  When  Asset  Mgt  HHT  and  ES-S  in  unavailable,  process  a special inventory request to freeze the item record using TEX Code “P”. See Special  Inventory  Interrogation  Input  (1GP), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt  1, Ch 5 for  format.  Forward  all  copies  of  the  refused  document  along  with  special inventory output notice to the inventory control function. 5.3.8.4.1.6.3.  If the issue is for a repair cycle item, prepare and process a due-in from maintenance (DIFM) detail change input to load status “RFS” to the DIFM detail. Refer to Due-In From Maintenance (DIFM) Updates in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 4 for processing instructions. 5.3.8.4.1.6.4.  Notify  Customer  Support  of  all  warehouse-refused  documents. Note:  Customer  Support  will  notify  AFMC  if  warehouse  refusal  is  for  a shipment or Redistribution Order. (T-2). 5.3.8.4.1.6.5.  When Inventory finds the asset. Retrieve the Asset Management record from history or the 1348-1A from document control files. Pull the asset and move to customer delivery. 5.3.8.4.2.  Zero  Balance  Validation.  To  facilitate  zero  balance  validation,  the  supply system  automatically  identifies  documents  or  transactions  (ISU,  BSU,  DOR,  SHP, and  A5J)  that  reduce  the  item  record  serviceable  balance  to  zero.  The  phrase  SER BAL = 0 will be printed in either block W or block F on physical documents. Bench stock issues (TRIC BSU) that reduce the item record serviceable balance to zero  are identified by a numeric zero in position 80. The individual validating the zero balance will  initial  next  to  the  zero  balance  phrase  to  indicate  the  check  has  been accomplished.  Note:  ES-S/AM  processing  stores  user  information  on  transaction histories, a physical document is not required. 5.3.8.4.2.1.  When  stock  remains,  request  a  special  inventory  for  the  warehouse location  indicated  on  transaction.  See  Special  Inventory  Interrogation  Input (1GP), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for inventory request format. 5.3.9.  Directed and Non Directed Shipments. 5.3.9.1.  Purpose: To explain base-initiated, non-directed shipment (SHP) procedures. For policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use  AFH 23-123. 5.3.9.2.  General:  AF  bases  can  initiate  shipments  of  supply  (ERRCD  XB3,  XF3,  and XD2) and equipment (NF*/ND*) items when required. Base-initiated shipments can also be used to ship assets when the application of “special shipment procedures” is required. One common use of base-initiated shipments is base-to-base lateral support. (Note bases are not authorized to initiate asset shipments to non-AF activities (such as other Services, DLA, or GSA). Bases are not authorized to return serviceable AF managed assets back to AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 181 Air  Logistics  Complex’s  using  transaction  SHP,  bases  should  receive  redistribution orders (A2*) from the item manager. Bases will perform physical bare item inspection of property (identaplate, engraving, decal, or label) to ensure: proper identification of asset IAW  MIL-STD-129,  Military  Marking  for  Shipment  and  Storage;  and  that  materiel shipped  matches  supporting  documentation  AFTO  Form  350,  Reparable  Item  Tag  and ILS-S records. (T-1). 5.3.9.2.1.  Lateral  requisition  procedures  allow  for  an  ILS-S  account  to  requisition either  stock  replenishment  and/or  due-out  requirements  from  another  ILS-S  account provided  there  is  a  mutual  agreement  between  the  Supply  activities.  This  form  of support can be for selected items or a full range of items. See AFI 23-101, Sec.  2B, for  detailed  information  about  lateral  support  policy  for  CONUS  and  OCONUS bases. 5.3.9.2.1.1.  Note:  Lateral support shipments are subject to the asset release rules detailed  in  Lateral  Support  Requisitioning  Procedures,  High  priority  lateral support in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 and ES-S User’s Manual. AFH 23-123, Vol  2,  Pt  4,  Ch  6  provides  details  which  supports  both  manual  sourcing  and automatic sourcing tools. 5.3.9.2.1.2.  The activity required to pay for lateral support transportation charges are dependent on whether the asset being shipped is included within the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF), or not and whether the asset is an Item Manager directed  shipment  or  not.  Details  are  provided  in  AFI  65-601  Vol  1,  Budget Guidance and Procedures. 5.3.9.2.1.3.  Processing a lateral support non-directed shipment (SHP) transaction causes the  ILS-S to  output a DD 1348-1A,  Issue  Release/Receipt. Base logistics personnel  use  the  output  release/receipt  document  to  pick  (from  the  supply warehouse location) and ship the redistributed asset. AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2, provides Nondirected Shipment (SHP) Output Format - DD 1348-1A. 5.3.9.2.2.  Status for base-initiated shipments is programmatically passed to the base receiving  the  redistributed  asset  by  the  ILS-S  via  supply  status  (AE*)  transactions. Additionally,  the  ILS-S  at  the  receiving  base  programmatically  initiates  follow-up action  with  the  shipping  base  via  MILSTRIP  follow-up  transactions.  Refer  to  Sec. 5B,  for  additional  information  about  supply  status  (AE*)  and  MILSTRIP  follow-up (AFC) transactions. 5.3.9.3.  The  ES-S  Manage  Outbound  Shipment  process  provides  enhanced  capabilities for  managing  movements  from  initial  shipment  through  Cargo  Movement  until  the receipt  is  processed  at  the  gaining  base.  This  capability  focuses  on  ensuring  outbound shipments are planned, packaged and executed by Cargo Movement personnel within the standard  timeframes  defined  for  the  current  Delinquent  Shipment  Listing  process,  and that base shipments arrive at the proper destination in the correct quantity. Refer to ES-S User’s Manual for more information. 5.3.9.4.  There are a number of circumstances where special procedures must be used to generate base shipments. 5.3.9.4.1.  For Non-Reimbursable Shipments. 182 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.3.9.4.1.1.  Use  of  Advice  Code  and  FREE  SHPMNT  Phrase.  Stock  Control inputs  advice  code  2E  when  Funds  Management  has  approved  a  request  for nonreimbursable  shipment.  When  code  2E  is  input,  the  phrase  FREE  SHPMNT will appear on the output DD Form 1348-1A shipping document. 5.3.9.4.1.2.  When a request is received for a non-reimbursable shipment, AFMC will: 5.3.9.4.1.2.1.  Approve or disapprove the request. 5.3.9.4.1.2.2.  File a copy of the request in suspense. The Funds Management reviews  this  copy  against  the  daily  Free  Issue  and  Credit  Code  Y  Turn-Ins Listing, Base Supply Surveillance Report D20/NGV821). 5.3.9.4.1.2.3.  When the shipment is for a vendor-owned container, no further action is required. 5.3.9.4.1.2.4.  When  the  shipment  was  previously  approved  by  Funds Management, no further action is required. 5.3.9.4.1.2.5.  When  neither  approval  nor  disapproval  was  obtained,  AFMC must record approval or disapproval on the listing. 5.3.9.4.1.2.5.1.  When  the  shipment  is  approved,  no  further  action  is required. 5.3.9.4.1.2.5.2.  When  the  shipment  is  not  approved,  AFMC  will  take  the following  actions  together  with  personnel  from  base  level  Customer Support/SMAG  Liaison  POCs  to  coordinate  with  Materiel  Management Flight/transportation  activity  and  the  shipment  processing  activity  (AFMC or LRS/Materiel Management Activity): 5.3.9.4.1.2.5.2.1.  Attempt to stop the shipment. 5.3.9.4.1.2.5.2.2.  Recover the shipping document. 5.3.9.4.1.2.5.2.3.  Reverse-post the transaction. 5.3.9.4.1.2.5.2.4.  Reinput  the  shipment  as  a  normal  reimbursable transaction. 5.3.9.4.1.2.5.3.  When  a  FREE  SHPMNT  cannot  be  aborted,  the  Funds Management marks the listing as disapproved with comments indicating the attempt  to  stop  the  shipment  was  unsuccessful.  Before  forwarding  the original  request  to  Stock  Control,  Funds  Management  will  sign  and mark/stamp  the  original  to  indicate  whether  the  request  was  approved  or disapproved. 5.3.9.4.1.2.5.4.  When  Funds  Management disapproved requests, Stock Control will take the following actions: returns the  approved  or 5.3.9.4.1.2.5.5.  Process a SHP input for approved requests with advice code 2E. 5.3.9.4.1.2.5.6.  Process  a  SHP  input  for  disapproved  requests  without  an AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 183 advice code. 5.3.9.4.2.  Shipment of Serviceable Assets Direct from a Detail. 5.3.9.4.2.1.  Use  of  Document  Numbers.  The  detail  document  number  must  be entered in positions 67-80 when serviceable assets are to be shipped from MSK, supply point, MRSP, or WRM details. 5.3.9.4.2.2.  Automatic  Replenishment  of  Assets.  The  ILS-S  automatically initiates  replenishment  requisitioning  for  shipped  MSK,  supply  point,  MRSP,  or WRM  assets  unless  the  TEX  code  in  position  51  of  the  shipment  transaction (SHP) contains a “+.” 5.3.9.4.3.  Classified and Sensitive Item Shipments. 5.3.9.4.3.1.  Release  of  Classified/Sensitive  Items.  Classified  material  will  be released only to individuals identified by the LRS CC/AO as authorized to receive classified material. When someone is to receive classified material, first check the individual's  military  or  civilian  identification  card  and  verify  his/her  identity. Identity will be verified against approved classified authorization list/letter. Make the identity  check before the individual signs the DD  Form 1348-1A and before releasing the materiel. 5.3.9.4.3.2.  Preparation of DD Form 1348-1A Hand Receipt. The ILS-S prepares three copies of the DD Form 1348-1A for use as a hand receipt for directed and non-directed shipments of classified/sensitive items (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch  2  5  for  the  Classified  Hand  Receipt  Output  Format).  Requirements  for  off-base  shipment  of  these  items  must  contain  one  of  the  classified  or  sensitive controlled item codes (listed in DoD 4100.39-M, Vol,10, Table 61). 5.3.9.4.3.2.1.  Asset  Management  personnel  stamp  or  write  CLASSIFIED ITEM in red ink on all copies of DD Form 1348-1A when a shipment (FTR, A2*, A4*, SHP, or A5J) is produced for a classified item. 5.3.9.4.3.2.2.  LRS/transportation  activity  personnel  place  the  three  extra copies in the shipping container with the other shipment documents. 5.3.9.4.3.2.3.  DD Form 1907, Signature and Tally Record is used only for the transportation portion of a movement. 5.3.9.4.4.  Movement  of  Classified  Shipments  via  Total  Delivery  Service  (TDS) contract  carrier.  Secret  and  Confidential  freight  shipments  may  be  moved  within CONUS  via  TDS  contract  carrier  small  package  express  carrier  provided  there  is strict adherence to the restrictions and processes contained in AFI 24-203, Preparation and  Movement  of  Air  Force  Cargo.  Shipments  must  comply  with  provisions contained  in  DoDM  5100.76,  V3  and  AFI  16-1404.  LRS/transportation  activity personnel  must  develop  locally  written  procedures  with  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  personnel,  information  management,  and  security  personnel  covering  the preparation,  handling,  receipt,  documentation,  and  delivery  of  classified  shipments using  this  method  of  transportation.  Ensure  these  procedures  include  the  possible shipment of classified property directly from decentralized support elements such as flight-line operated parts stores and flight service centers. 184 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.3.9.4.4.1.  Cargo Movement is responsible for ensuring the package, wrapping, marking, and addressing are in compliance with applicable directives if packed by Cargo  Movement,  otherwise  it  is  the  shipper’s  responsibility.  The  carrier’s package may be used as the outer wrapper. Classification markings, packing lists, and  classified  document  receipts  will  be  located  on  the  inner  container.  Contact local  Cargo  Movement  personnel,  and  review  AFI  24-203,  Preparation  and Movement  of  Air  Force  Cargo  for  guidance  when  considering  using  the  Next Generation  Delivery  Service  (NGDS)  contract  small  package  express  carrier  for movement of classified material. 5.3.9.4.5.  Reliability Improvement Warranty (RIW) Item Shipments. 5.3.9.4.5.1.  Identification of RIW  Items. RIW items  are managed by the AFMC item manager and are identified in the ILS-S by the SNUD. SNUD performs the following for RIW assets: 5.3.9.4.5.1.1.  Set the item record RIW program to 1. 5.3.9.4.5.1.2.  Set the repair cycle record RIW program code to G. 5.3.9.4.5.1.3.  Changes  the  disposition  field  to  the  database  key  of  the applicable shipping destination record. 5.3.9.4.5.2.  Redistribution  of  Serviceable/Unserviceable  RIW Item Manager-directed RIW shipments to the DLADS will be processed IAW Disposal and  Demilitarization  instructions  described  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  6. RIW shipments processed for return to a contractor must contain project code 390 and  project  name  PACER  WARRANT.  See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for the format of the RIW Shipment Notification (XFA) transaction. Items. 5.3.9.4.5.2.1.  Results  of  RIMCS  Loads.  Most  RIW  items  will  be  assigned RAMPS  report  codes,  and  the  load  of  RIMCS  data  found  on  SNUD  will usually create an automatic shipment. When the TIN is input with TEX code 1 (to request offline disposition from the applicable item manager) the asset can be  shipped  to  the  routing  identifier  code.  These  shipments  are  accomplished by  making  a  SHP  input  using  the  serial  number  in  positions  46-50  of  the RIMCS input image. 5.3.9.4.5.2.2.  Processing  Through  Intermediate  Repair  Facilities.  When  the RIW contractor has an intermediate repair facility at the Primary Supply Point (PSP)  base,  and  when  all  reparable  assets  must  be  processed  through  this facility  because  of  a  contractual  agreement,  then  the  off-shore  activity  must load  a  shipment  override  record  identifying  the  intermediate  facility  as  the ship-to  SRAN.  This  load  will  override  the  automatic  shipment  to  the intermediate facility. 5.3.9.4.6.  NWRM SHP/A2x/A4x Shipments: Before sourcing for lateral support, the NWRM  Transaction  Control  Center  (NTCC)  will  always  verify  that  D035  does  not already reflect a shipment released against the original due-in. 5.3.9.4.6.1.  LRS\Materiel Management Activity will provide the NTCC with the requestor’s  information  along  with  NSN,  part  number,  quantity,  unit  of  issue, AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 185 gaining base SRAN, applicable serial number(s), and condition code. (T-1). 5.3.9.4.6.2.  NTCC  will  contact  the  IM  to  ensure  the  gaining  base/address  is authorized to receive the asset(s). 5.3.9.4.6.3.  NTCC will lift the freeze code “N”  via 1FC processing, process  the SHP/A2x/A4x request, then reprocess the freeze code “N”. 5.3.9.4.6.4.  NTCC will notify the IM of pending shipment and will track asset(s) through transportation channels to final destination. 5.3.9.4.6.5.  NTCC will update Positive Inventory Control (PIC) Fusion. 5.3.9.4.7.  Deficient  Item  Shipment  Conditions  That  Warrant  Shipped  Not  Credited (SNC)  Detail  Creation  Procedures:  Shipments  for  unserviceable  budget  code  9 deficient  items  are  manually  initiated  by  AFMC  via  Nondirected  Shipment  (SHP) transactions. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for detailed processing instructions). This  SNC  detail  provides  Accounting  and  Finance  with  a  suspense  record  for identifying and following up on transactions for credit purposes. 5.3.9.4.8.  Disposition of Certain Chemical Defense Equipment (CDE). 5.3.9.4.8.1.  This  paragraph  applies  to  the  disposition/return  of  certain  CDE  by use of routing identifier code B14 which is managed by the U.S. Army Armament Munitions and Chemical Command, Rock Island IL. 5.3.9.4.8.2.  Procedures.  To  ensure requirements, the following procedures apply: the  Air  Force  complies  with  Army 5.3.9.4.8.2.1.  Stock Control assigns SEX code 2 to item records for the stock numbers listed below. The ILS-S will report CDE to RID B14 for disposition instructions  via  Report  of  Redistributable (FTE) transactions, regardless of excess or asset condition. (Excess)  Materiel Table 5.7.

All  returns  of  CDE  material,  regardless  of  condition,  must  be correctly  packaged  and  labeled.  All  NSNs  should  be  packed  separately  to facilitate  depot  receipt,  handling,  and  safe  storage.  Return  items  must  be labeled or manifested as hazardous waste. 5.3.10.  Organizational Refusals. 5.3.10.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  organizational  refusal  procedure  process.  For  policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.3.10.2.  Organizational  refusals  occur  when  a  customer  refuses  to  accept  an  item  for any number of reasons. 5.3.10.2.1.  When  this  occurs  the  person  refusing  the  property  (the  custodian  or  his alternate  for  equipment  items)  must  annotate  all  copies  of  the  ISU/MSI/DOR document with the phrase ORGANIZATION REFUSAL, give a brief explanation for refusing the property, and sign the document. 5.3.10.3.  LRS  Transportation  Actions.  LRS  transportation  personnel  will  return  the property  along  with  the  issue/due  out  release  document  to  materiel  management inspection activity. 5.3.10.4.  LRS\Materiel  Management  Activity  Inspection  Actions.  Upon  receipt  of  an item and applicable issue/due-out release document annotated with ORGANIZATIONAL REFUSAL, Inspection personnel will determine the primary responsibility for the refusal. Inspection  personnel  will  consider  the  reason  for  refusal  stated  on  the  issue/due-out release  document  and  an  inspection  of  the  item  when  making  this  determination.  For example,  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  is  responsible  if  the  property  is misidentified, unserviceable, an unsuitable substitute, or the quantity issued is  in excess of what the customer ordered. The customer is responsible if the wrong item was ordered, or if the item was shipped due to a failure to cancel a due-out. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,  Ch  5,  for  more  specific  information  about  processing  Organizational  Refusals.  Note: Do NOT reverse-post items  returned because 1) too  many  were issued, or 2) the wrong item was issued and returned after having been signed for. Process these items according to the correct return (TIN) procedures explained in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 187 5.3.11.  Deficiency Reports. 5.3.11.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  deficiency  report  procedures  process.  For  policy  specific requirements refer to AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123. 5.3.11.2.  Upon receipt of a supply or equipment item with a deficiency or latent defect, report the Deficiency Report asset and prepare the asset for immediate return according to T.O. 00-35D-54. 5.3.11.3.  Control of Deficiency Report Exhibits. The originating point maintains control of the exhibit when the size and configuration of the asset allows. When the exhibit size and  configuration  allow,  move  the  exhibit  to  a  controlled  area  (preferably  locked)  to ensure  the  exhibit  is  not  altered  or  lost.  Normally,  this  controlled  area  is  in  the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. When there is not enough space in the LRS/Materiel Management Activity, maintenance may store the exhibit pending final disposition. There is an exception to this policy when maintenance becomes the permanent storage location. When  the  need  arises  to  establish  a  permanent  storage  area  within  maintenance,  the organization must request approval authority from AF/A4LR, through its MAJCOM. 5.3.11.4.  Materiel Deficiency Returns. Process Deficiency Report to include latent defect returns  as  follows.  Maintenance  personnel  initiating  deficiency  returns  must  provide materiel  management  personnel  with  a  copy  of  the  initial  deficiency  report  (DR) submittal paperwork with the deficient property at the time of return. The return will not be processed without the required paperwork. 5.3.11.4.1.  Unserviceable  Supply  (ERRCD  X**)  Items.  For  unserviceable  supply item  returns,  indicate  the  unsatisfactory  condition  of  materiel  by  entering  supply condition  code  Q  and  action  taken  code  C.  EXCEPTION:  Use  action  taken  code  C and supply condition E for Federal Supply Class (FSC) 3110 routing identifier code Sxx, ERRCD XF3. 5.3.11.4.2.  The  ILS-S  will  programmatically  assign  supply  condition  code  Q  to  the unserviceable. 5.3.11.4.3.  The  ILS-S  will  programmatically  update  the  appropriate  details  (for example,  due-in  from  maintenance  (DIFM),  in-use)  when  returns  with  action  taken code C are processed. 5.3.11.4.4.  The  ILS-S  will  produce  a  management  notice  I012  (stock  awaiting disposition)  on  the  input  terminal  reflecting  the  unserviceable  detail  document number. A 156ALL inquiry will also be programmatically printed reflecting the NSN affected by the deficiency report action. Be sure to attach a copy of the management notice to the property so it can be readily identified. 5.3.11.5.  Processing  Deficiency  Report  Returns.  The  Flight  Service  Center  (FSC)  will process  Deficiency  Report  or  latent  defect  returns  for  items  assigned  ERRCD  XD,  XF, XB.  EAE  will  process  return  documents  for  Deficiency  Report  or  latent  defects  on equipment managed items. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for return (TIN) formats. FSC/ EAE will process the return if the degraded operations method is used. 5.3.11.5.1.  When deficiency report items are assigned budget code 8 or 9, the ILS-S return program logic will automatically grant credit (assign credit code Y) based upon 188 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 the  action  taken  code  of  C  and  condition  code  Q.  Funds  manager  approval  is  not needed. 5.3.11.5.2.  Store  deficiency  report  assets  in  a  central  location  in  the  LRS/Materiel Management Activity warehouse unless the items are too large. 5.3.11.6.  Check  for  Similar  Deficient  Assets.  FSC  or  EAE  personnel  (for  equipment assets) will query the ILS-S database to determine if there are additional assets (with the same  NSN)  requiring  deficiency  report  action.  When  additional  assets  exist,  coordinate with the using maintenance activity to determine if the assets should be tested for similar deficiencies. When other assets have the same deficiency, use the following procedures: 5.3.11.6.1.  When  an  organization  is  using  the  asset,  the  maintenance  activity reporting  deficiency  will  determine  whether  the  item  should  be  used  or  turned  in. When return is required, process the asset (according to the section above). 5.3.11.6.2.  When the asset is in base stock, coordinate with the maintenance activity to  determine  whether  the  assets  should  be  removed  from  stock  or  remain  in  stock. When the assets are to be removed, process according to this section. 5.3.11.6.3.  Use  the  instructions  in  T.O.  00-35D-54  to  monitor  deficiency  report pending  actions.  The  deficiency  report  will  be  monitored  using  the  materiel deficiency report portion of the unserviceable DIFM Detail List. When the maximum hold  date  is  exceeded  and  no  disposition  instructions  have  been  received,  follow instructions in T.O. 00-35D-54. 5.3.11.7.  Deficient Warranty Item Returns. For pre-post returns, forward property and all copies of the DD Form 1348-1A to the holding area. 5.3.11.7.1.  When  the  defective  item  is  authorized  for  field  level  repair,  determine whether  the  item  should  be  repaired  or  if  disposition  should  be  requested  from  the SPM/IM.  When  the  item  is  mission  essential  and  in  critical  short  supply  and  non-availability  would  adversely  affect  the  mission  capability  of  the  activity  concerned, the  item  should  be  repaired  locally  and  returned  to  service.  On  those  defective warranted  items  which  are  not  turned  in  to  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  but are  repaired  on  site,  maintenance  will  notify  supply  of  their  decision  to  repair. LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity,  in  turn,  will  advise  the  SPM/IM  by  message including the information below that the item was repaired and returned to service. 5.3.11.7.2.  RIW  items  will  not  be  repaired  locally,  except  in  such  cases  where  the warranty  identification  tags  and/or  equipment  technical  order  specifies  that  such repair is authorized. Procedures for RIW items are contained below. 5.3.11.7.3.  On  items  for  which  disposition  instructions  are  required,  attach  a  DD Form 1575, Suspended Tag - Materiel/1575-1, Suspended Label-Materiel, to the item to identify the item as an exhibit with condition code "Q." 5.3.11.7.4.  Notify  the  applicable  SPM/IM  (T.O.  00-25-115)  by  message  of  the defective item furnishing the NSN, contract number, and all data available regarding the defect and request disposition instructions. 5.3.11.7.5.  Follow disposition instructions according to SPM/IM. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 189 5.3.12.  Bench Stock (Add, Change, Delete and Reconciliation). 5.3.12.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  bench  stock  procedures  process.  For  policy  specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.3.12.2.  Bench stocks are consumable items kept on-hand in a work center to increase mission  support.  As  such,  the  ILS-S  includes  functionality  that  makes  use  of  historical organizational  item  consumption  data  to  recommend  the  quantity  of  items  customers should  include,  maintain  or  delete  in  organizational  bench  stocks.  The  process  also provides customers the flexibility to include consumable items in their bench stocks with little or no historical consumption. The specific criteria for bench stock item qualification are provided in Bench Stock Item Qualification Criteria paragraph. The logic used in the ILS-S  for  determining  bench  stock  item  add,  change,  and  deletion  recommendations  is described in Sec. 5C 5.3.12.3.  Advantages and Disadvantages of Bench Stocks. 5.3.12.3.1.  Advantages of Bench Stocks. Bench stock items are physically stored in the maintenance work area, bench stock customers have ready access to the items as needed. Consumption of bench stock items requires no paperwork or communication with  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel.  Bench  stocks  also  result  in reduced workload for base logistics support activities since the items are periodically replenished  in  bulk  quantities  rather  than  being  issued,  picked,  and  delivered individually each time a customer need occurs. 5.3.12.3.2.  Disadvantages  of  Bench  Stocks.  Bench  stock  inventory  must  be purchased at the time of replenishment since maintenance funds are expended for the purchase  of  bench  stock  items  in  advance  of  actual  need,  there  is  at  least  some potential for buying unneeded items. Organizational bench stock customers must also provide  the  storage  space  and  storage  bins  required  for  maintaining  bench  stock inventories.  There  is  also  an  organizational  workload  associated  with  periodically coordinating  bench  stock  inventory  range  and  depth  updates  with  base  logistics support  personnel.  The  establishment  and  maintenance  of  customer  bench  stock records  is  a  recurring  workload  for  LRS/Materiel  Management  personnel.  Finally, from  a  materiel  management  point  of  view,  it  is  disadvantageous  that  inventory issued to organizational bench stocks is no longer visible within ILS-S. 5.3.12.4.  Bench  Stock  Responsibilities  for  Organizational  Customers  and  LRS/Materiel Management Activity Personnel. 5.3.12.4.1.  The Organizational Customer will: 5.3.12.4.2.  Appoint a primary and alternate bench stock monitor. (T-2). 5.3.12.4.2.1.  Ensure  newly  appointed  bench  stock  monitors  attend/receive  Base Level  Supply  Customer  Training  as  it  pertains  to  Block  I  (General  Supply Indoctrination)  and  Block  IIA  (Bench  Stock)  training  prior  to  assuming responsibilities as a bench stock monitor. (T-1). 5.3.12.4.2.2.  Provide secure bench stock storage. (T-1). 5.3.12.4.2.2.1.  Care  and  safe-guard  bench  stocks  IAW  AFI  23-111, Management of Government Property in Possession of the AF. (T-1). 190 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.3.12.4.2.3.  Ensure  controls  are  established  for  shelf  life  items  to  ensure  that older  shelf  life  items  are  used  first  to  minimize  the  occurrence  of  expired, unusable items. (T-1). 5.3.12.4.2.4.  Monitoring  each  bench  stock  item  balance  for  replenishment  (see Routine Bench Stock Cycle Replenishment. (T-1). 5.3.12.4.2.5.  Reviewing  bench  stock  due-outs.  The  ILS-S  will  provide  each organization with  a Daily  Document Register that will serve as the basis for  the review. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for a complete description of the Daily Document  Register.  Bench  stock  customers  may  also  obtain  Due-Out  Status Listings to validate organizational bench stock backorders. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for additional information about Due-Out Status Listings. 5.3.12.4.3.  The LRS/Materiel Management Activity will: 5.3.12.4.3.1.  Create and maintain bench stock records to document requested and approved  customer  bench  stock  authorization  requests.  (T-1).  See  AFH  23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for transactions and procedures required to Load Master Bench Stock  Detail  Records  (2BSL),  Master  Bench  Stock  Record  Change  (2BSC), Master  Bench  Stock  Record/EOQ  Delete  (2BSD),  and  Master  Bench  Stock Consolidation (2BSCON) transactions. 5.3.12.4.3.1.1.

Bench  Stock  Item  Qualification  Criteria.  Before  a  bench  stock  is  established, the following minimum criteria must be met. 5.3.12.5.1.  The  item  record  Expendability,  Recoverability,  Reparability  Coded (ERRC) designator must be XB3. 5.3.12.5.2.  Restricted  Item  Codes.  In  general,  the  item  record  must  not  be  coded  as follows: 5.3.12.5.2.1.  Disposal (numeric parts preference code (NPPC) 2). On-hand/in-use assets that have an NPPC 2 may be issued/used if they satisfy a local requirement or until the cost to repair the item exceeds its value. 5.3.12.5.2.2.  Time  Compliance  Technical  Order  (TCTO)  (numeric  parts preference code 4). 5.3.12.5.2.3.  Non-published  (numeric  parts  preference  code  5).  On-hand/in-use assets that have an NPPC 5 may be issued/used if they satisfy a local requirement or until the cost to repair the item exceeds its value. 5.3.12.5.2.4.  Unacceptable for AF use (numeric parts preference code 9). 5.3.12.5.2.5.  Recoverable  Assembly  Management  Process Reserve Material (WRM) codes 5, 6, 7, or E. (RAMPS)/War 5.3.12.5.2.6.  Classified,  sensitive,  or  issue  exception  codes  (IEX)  3,  6,  E,  or  K. 192 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Additional details regarding classified items are provided later in this chapter. 5.3.12.5.3.  Quantity Irregularities. Items that are normally used in quantities that are different from the unit of issue (for example, nuts, bolts, screws, etc.) and items that have  a  quantity  of  issue  different  from  the  quantity  unit  pack,  should  be  added  to bench stock to the maximum levels possible. 5.3.12.5.4.  Controlled  Items  in  Bench  Stocks.  The  following  rules  apply  to  items with a controlled item code. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 and DoD 4100.39-M for details about controlled item codes. 5.3.12.5.4.1.  Controlled  Items  Not  Requiring  IEX.  Controlled  item  code  *,  I,  J, U,  7,  Y,  and  Z  are  authorized  on  bench  stock.  None  of  these  categories  require issue exception codes loaded on the item record. 5.3.12.5.4.2.  Controlled  Items  Requiring  IEX.  Controlled  item  code  R  items, other  than  photographic  items,  are  authorized  on  bench  stock  when  the  unit commander has given his approval in writing. Items in this category will require an issue exception code N to be loaded to the item record. 5.3.12.5.4.3.  Photographic Items. Controlled item code *, J, R, or X items may be authorized on bench stock with the written approval of the unit commander who controls and manages bench stock. 5.3.12.5.4.3.1.  Requesting  Approval.  The  shop  supervisor/bench  stock manager  will  send  a  letter  to  his/her  commander  asking  to  add  the  items  to bench stock (specifying org/shop code). The letter will list the national stock number (NSN), nomenclature, and unit of issue of each photographic type of item to be added. 5.3.12.5.4.3.2.  Approval Letters. If the additional items are approved, endorse the  letter  to  the  Customer  Support  Liaison  Element.  After  LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  personnel  take  action,  Customer  Support  Liaison Element  will  endorse  the  letter  back  to  the  applicable  unit  commander  so  a successor will be aware of the action and comply with AFI 23-111. 5.3.12.5.4.4.  Controlled  Item  Codes  S  and  C.  With  MAJCOM  approval,  items with  controlled  item  codes  S  and  C  items  may  be  included  on  organizational bench  stocks  when  demand  data  indicates  it  is  advantageous  to  do  so.  In accordance with MAJCOM guidelines, supplement this chapter with a local issue exception  code  indicating,  “Classified/Secret  Item  authorized  on  Bench  Stock.” When  authorized  by  MAJCOM,  classified  bench  stock  material  must  meet  all security,  storage,  and  access  provisions  outlined  in  AFI  16-1404,  and  DoDM 5100.76, V3. 5.3.12.5.4.5.  Other  Controlled  Item  Codes.  Controlled  item  codes  not  specified above  are  authorized  on  bench  stock  when  the  unit  commander  has  given approval  in  writing.  Assigning  issue  exception  code  N  to  the  item  record  will further  identify  items  in  this  category.  When  IEX  N  is  assigned,  the  other  item flag for bench stock items will be assigned with a stock control data change. The bench stock flag will be assigned by the ILS-S when a master bench stock detail AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 193 is loaded. 5.3.12.5.5.  Off-Base Supported Organizations. Unless specifically included in a joint tenancy  agreement,  or  some  specific  directive,  the  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  will  not  perform  a  walk-thru  inventory  of  bench  stock  assets  to  off-base organizations. 5.3.12.6.  Bench Stock Item Add, Change and Delete Logic. 5.3.12.6.1.  This  logic  is  used  in  the  ILS-S  to  develop  recommendations  for  adding, deleting, and changing the quantities of items in organizational bench stocks. 5.3.12.6.2.  Guidelines for Adding and Deleting Items from Bench Stocks. The bench stock  process  makes  use  of  organizational  historical  consumption  and  customer desires  to  determine  what  range  of  items  to  include  in  a  customer  bench  stock.  The range  determination  may  result  in  the  addition  or  deletion  of  an  item  from  a  bench stock. 5.3.12.6.2.1.  Bench  Stock  Additions.  The  identification  of  candidates  for  bench stock addition is either consumption-based or specified by bench stock customers. 5.3.12.6.2.1.1.  Consumption-Based Bench Stock Add Recommendations. The ILS-S uses organization-specific historical consumption data to identify items that,  based  on  past  demand,  price,  and  other  item  characteristics,  are candidates  for  addition  to  an  organizational  bench  stock.  For  details  about ILS-S  procedures  for  identifying  bench  stock  addition  candidates,  see  the Bench Stock Review (M04/NGV850) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5. The bench  stock  review  logic  recommends  items  for  addition  to  organizational bench stocks meeting the qualifying conditions detailed in Bench Stock Item Qualification  Criteria  where  organizational  economic  order  quantity  (EOQ) consumption  detail  record  indicates  there  have  been  three  or  more  customer demands and the EOQ consumption detail has existed for at least 30 days. 5.3.12.6.2.1.2.  Non-Consumption-Based Additions. Organizational  bench  stock  customers  can  request  the  addition  of  qualifying items  to  bench  stocks  regardless  of  historical  consumption  under  certain conditions.  See  procedures  for  Establishing  Non-Consumption-Based  Bench Stock Items section for a complete list of non-consumption-based bench stock qualification conditions. Bench Stock 5.3.12.6.2.2.  Bench  Stock  Deletions.  Like  additions,  bench  stock  deletion candidates  are  based  on  organizational  consumption  history  and  bench  stock customer desires. 5.3.12.6.2.2.1.  Consumption-Based Recommendations. Consumption-based  bench  stock  items  that  become  inactive  (have  no consumption) are candidates for deletion from bench stocks. Deletion 5.3.12.6.2.2.2.  Non-Consumption-Based  Deletions.  Organizational  bench stock  owners  may  request  deletion  of  bench  stock  items  at  any  time  based upon mission support or financial considerations. 194 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.3.12.6.3.  Bench Stock Quantity Determination. The determination of what quantity to apply to customer bench stocks is based upon consumption and non-consumption based support periods for individual items. 5.3.12.6.3.1.  Consumption-based  Support  Period.  Unless  otherwise  specified  by the organizational bench stock owner, the depth of stock for bench stock items is calculated  based  upon  a  30-day  support  requirement.  That  is,  the  bench  stock quantity  is  the  quantity  required  to  fill  the  organization’s  anticipated  demands, based on their historical demand history, for a 30-day period. 5.3.12.6.3.2.  Non-Consumption-Based Organization commanders may deviate from  the 30-day support requirement by specifying an alternative  number  of  support  days  in  the  Organizational  Bench  Stock  Stockage Days Field of the BS OCCR. Support Period. 5.3.12.6.4.  Organizational Cost Center Record (OCCR) Bench Stock Stockage Days Field. When the bench stock stockage days field is populated, the ILS-S will use that value  in  calculating  the  depth  of  stock  for  bench  stock  items.  Additionally,  bench stock quantity calculations are altered as specified when a master bench stock detail record contains a minimum reserve authorization (MRA) or a maximum authorization quantity (MAQ). 5.3.12.7.  Conditions for Non-Consumption-Based Bench Stock Additions. An item may be  added  to  bench  stock  via  MRA  and  MAQ  procedures  described  in  this  section, regardless of consumption data, if one of the following conditions applies: 5.3.12.7.1.  The  end-item  being  supported  is  a  primary  mission  aircraft,  missile system, or communications electronic maintenance (CEM), and the applicable group commander has determined that maintenance cannot wait for the item to be delivered from a LRS/Materiel Management Activity warehouse. 5.3.12.7.2.  The using activity is off base or in a remote area of the base, and the item must be at the using location. 5.3.12.7.3.  The  unit  of  issue  is  not  compatible  with  the  unit  of  use  (such  as  nuts, bolts, and screws) or with the quantity unit pack (QUP) (such as wire which comes in 50 foot rolls). 5.3.12.8.  Procedures  for  Establishing  Non-Consumption-Based  Bench  Stock  Items. Commands  have  the  option  to  use  adjusted  stock  levels  to  support  bench  stock  items. Bases  will  use  MRA  or  MAQ  procedures  to  establish,  order,  and  maintain  adequate stockage for bench stock levels not based on normal consumption. 5.3.12.8.1.  MAQ/MRA Flags. The Bench Stock Review (M04/NGV850) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 is normally used to calculate bench stock authorized quantities. Bench  stock  authorized  quantities  that  are  not  based  on  consumption  may  be established via the use of MAQ or MRA procedures. See this section for the details about  how to  specify MRA/MAQ quantities and flags in  Master  Bench  Stock detail records. MRA/MAQ flags and their definitions are provided in Table 5.8. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 195 Table 5.8.  MRA/MAQ Flags and Definitions. Code 1 2 3 4 A B C D BLANK Meaning Bench stock minimum reserve authorization based on a 30-day requirement Bench stock maximum authorized quantity based on a 30-day requirement Bench stock minimum reserve authorization based on a 45-day requirement Bench stock maximum authorization quantity based on a 45-day requirement Bench stock minimum reserve authorization based on a 60-day requirement Bench stock maximum quantity authorization based on a 60-day requirement Authorization based on consumption for 60 days with no bench stock minimum reserve QUP to be considered when computing recommended level. Using this code does not prevent automatic deletion if normal deletion criteria apply Authorization based on consumption for 30 days with no bench stock minimum reserve 5.3.12.8.2.  Not Used 5.3.12.8.3.  Impact of MRA/MAQ Flags on Bench Stock Quantity Calculations. 5.3.12.8.3.1.  MRA/MAQ  Flag  A,  B,  C,  3,  or  4.  If  a  master  bench  stock  detail record  contains  an  MRA/MAQ  flag  of  A,  B,  C,  3,  or  4,  the  MRA/MAQ  will override the bench stock stockage days. 5.3.12.8.3.2.  MRA/MAQ  Flag  C.  If  the  MRA/MAQ  flag  is  a  C,  the  authorized quantity will be computed based on 60-day consumption. 5.3.12.8.3.3.  MRA/MAQ Flag 1, 3, or A. If the MRA/MAQ flag is 1, 3, or A, the authorized  quantity  will  be  the  MRA  or  the  computed  consumption  quantity, whichever is  greater. When the date of last demand (DOLD) is  greater than 270 days,  the  item  is  no  longer  considered  for  automatic  change,  review  procedures must be accomplished. 5.3.12.8.3.4.  MRA/MAQ Flag 2, 4, or B. If the MRA/MAQ flag is 2, 4, or B, the authorized  quantity  will  be the  computed consumption quantity, whichever is smaller. When the DOLD is greater than 270 days,  the  item  is  no  longer  considered  for  automatic  change,  and  review procedures must be accomplished. the  maximum  authorized  or 5.3.12.8.4.  MRA/MAQ  Quantity  Letters.  Recertification  of  MRA/MAQ  will  be accomplished through the review process. 5.3.12.8.5.  Conformity. MRA/MAQ quantity changes required for conformance with quantity unit pack or materiel handling requirements do not require a letter from the supported organization and may be accomplished by annotating the listing. 5.3.12.9.  Master  Bench  Stock  Record  Load.  Bench  Stock  Review  Program Recommended Additions. 5.3.12.9.1.  The monthly Bench Stock Review Program will produce a listing of those items,  which  qualify  for  addition  to  an  organizational  bench  stock.  These  additions are computed from the EOQ consumption detail records, which are built from issues, 196 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 and  due-out  releases  processed  for  expendable  (ERRCD  XB3)  items  that  are  not currently on bench stock. When these listed items are not recommended for addition, these  details  are  maintained  in  the  database  for  180  days  before  they  are  deleted. Once an item has been recommended for addition, it will stay in the database for 30 days. If at the end of the 30-day period the item has not been added to a bench stock, the detail will be deleted and the consumption data will be deleted from the records. 5.3.12.9.2.  Recommended  add  transactions  will  not  be  produced  for  items  that  are assigned  RAMPS/WRM  report  codes  5,  6,  7,  or  E.  When  the  organization  elects  to add  these  items  to  their  bench  stock  and  a  reject  (extended  cost  exceeds  $1000.00 EOQ item) is produced when the transaction is processed, the organization should be notified  so  they  can  determine  if  a  suitable  substitute  can  be  added  to  their  bench stock in place of the originally recommended add item. See Load Master Bench Stock Detail Record (2BS) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for specific ILS-S information and processing. 5.3.12.9.3.  Addition of Items Not on the Bench Stock Review Program Listing. Upon receipt of a request to add items which are not on the monthly bench stock add listing, LRS\Materiel  Management  Activity  Customer  Support  Center  personnel  are  to accomplish the following: 5.3.12.9.3.1.  Verify the stock number and unit of issue. 5.3.12.9.3.2.  Furnish  the  issue  exception  code,  application  code,  and  system designator for each item. 5.3.12.9.3.3.  Review each item to ensure that all criteria for bench stock are met. 5.3.12.9.3.4.  Obtain  necessary  approvals  and  notify  the  requesting  activity  of action taken. 5.3.12.9.3.5.  Prepare and process a load input as described in this chapter to load the master bench stock detail. 5.3.12.9.3.6.  Prepare and process a bench stock issue. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,  Ch  5  for  specific  ILS-S  information  and  processing  Bench  Stock  Issue  (1BS) transactions. 5.3.12.10.  Master  Bench  Stock  Record  Change.  Changes  to  the  authorized  quantity  on existing  master  bench  stock  details  are  made  automatically  during  the  review.  The MRA/MAQ  flag  is  considered,  as  well  as  consumption,  in  computing  new  levels.  See Para.5.3.12.8.3.  for  additional  information  about  MRA/MAQ  flags.  Organizations  may request  changes  to  a  bench  stock  at  any  time  via  telephone,  letter,  email,  or  annotated listing. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for specific ILS-S information and processing Master Bench Stock Record Change (2BSC) transactions. 5.3.12.10.1.  Authorized  Quantity  Changes.  An  authorized  quantity  change  is computed only for substantial changes in consumption patterns. For this computation, a change that exceeds the square root of the previous authorized quantity is defined as substantial. The review program does not make changes smaller than the square root of the previous authorized quantity. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 197 5.3.12.10.2.  30-day Consumption Factor. A 30-day consumption factor will be used unless one of the following exists: 5.3.12.10.2.1.  The organization cost center record contains bench stock stockage days. 5.3.12.10.2.2.  The master bench stock detail record contains an MRA/MAQ flag of  A,  B,  C,  3,  or  4.  If  both  conditions  exist,  the  MRA/MAQ  will  override  the bench stock stockage days. 5.3.12.11.  Bench  Stock  Routine,  Stock-Out,  Urgent  Replenishment  and  Due-Out Procedures.  The  normal  responsibilities  of  Customer  Support  Center  personnel  include assistance in the establishment, change or deletion of Master Bench Stock details as well as the processing of bench stock issue requests as applicable. 5.3.12.11.1.  Routine  Bench  Stock  Cycle  Replenishment.  Bench  stock  items  should be  replenished  when  the  quantity  on  hand  is  equal  to  or  less  than  50  percent  of  the authorized  quantity.  This  should  be  done  once  every  30  days  (or  more  often  as necessary). The unit bench stock monitor will perform the following: 5.3.12.11.1.1.  Routine Walk-Through. Unit bench stock monitors should perform a  routine  walk-through  based  on  mission  needs  and  frequency  of  bench  stock replenishment  requests.  At  the  option  of  the  LRS  CC/AO  and  supported organization,  the  unit  bench  stock  monitor  processes  routine  bench  stock replenishment requests as soon as the 50 percent or below level is reached. When this  option  is  used,  the  organization  may  waive  the  weekly  walk  through.  The LRS CC/AO may authorize the organizational bench stock monitor use the ILS-S to enter their replenishment requests. Red flags may be used as an aid; when used, they  will  be  displayed  if  the  stock  is  below  50%  of  the  authorized  bench  stock level whether a due-out has been established or not. 5.3.12.11.1.2.  Document  Replenishment  Needs.  Unit  bench  stock  monitors  will circle  the  item  numbers  on  the  AF  Form  465,  Bench  Stock  Inventory  (Not  LRA) which  require  replenishment  and  then  process  issue  requests.  Customer  Support Center  personnel  will  process  requests  bench  stock  issue  requests  for  units  not having that capability. (T-2).  See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for specific ILS-S information and processing Bench Stock Issue (1BS) transactions. 5.3.12.11.1.3.  Coordinating  Customer  Excess  Disposition.  Customer  Support personnel  will  coordinate  with  the  supported  activity  to  take  the  appropriate action  when  excess  bench  stock  inventory  exists.  (T-2).  Items  will  not  be considered excess until the on-hand balance is more than twice the authorization. Excesses  will  initially  be  considered  for  return  review  (to  determine  if  return  is desired—or necessary, as in the case of storage problems within the bench stock). 5.3.12.11.2.  Stock-Out and Urgent Bench Stock Replenishment Procedures. 5.3.12.11.2.1.  Stock-Out  (Empty  Bin)  Reports.  The  organization  may  request normal  issue  processing  to  replenish  the  entire  bench  stock  authorization providing a backorder does not already exist for this item. 5.3.12.11.2.2.  Urgent  Bench  Stock  Requirements.  The  method  to  satisfy  urgent 198 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 bench  stock  requirements  will  be  determined  by  the  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity  in  coordination  with  the  supported  activity.  One  of  the  following methods will be used. 5.3.12.11.2.3.  Submit Issue Request. Process a priority issue request or call in an expedite  issue  request  to  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  using  activity code X and then follow normal issue procedures described earlier in this chapter, including  the  re-input  of  any  killed  quantity  after  validation.  Items  will  be delivered within specified delivery times. 5.3.12.11.2.4.  Submit  Request  to  Customer  Support  Liaison  Element.  The Customer Support Liaison will input a bench stock issue. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 Expendable Item Customer Issue Request (ISU) transaction format and processing  instructions.  If  the  request  is  filled  (issued),  a  DD  Form  1348-1A output  issue  document  will  be  produced.  The  customer  will  be  notified  of  item availability by telephone. The output issue document will be hand-carried to  the appropriate  warehouse  for  item  location.  Issued  items  will  be  delivered  within specified delivery times. 5.3.12.11.3.  After  Duty  Hour  Requests.  Provide  the  applicable  Customer  Support function with all the bench stock issue requests outside normal duty hours. 5.3.12.11.4.  Supply Support Delays. If the supply support (timeliness of receipts) for an  organizational  bench  stock  is  ineffective,  the  Customer  Support  Liaison  Element may request a Due-Out Status Listing or any other management product, or develop a QLP or SURGE program to ensure satisfactory supply action has been taken for due-outs.  This  will  be  coordinated  with  Stock  Control  to  ensure  maximum  bench  stock support. 5.3.12.11.5.  Bench Stock Due-Out Processing. 5.3.12.11.5.1.  Establish  Firm  Backorder  (Due-Out).  The  Customer  Support Center  will  establish  a  firm  customer  backorder  (due-out)  for  all  initial  bench stock fill requests that are processed when property is not available for issue. 5.3.12.11.5.1.1.  Due-Out Quantity Balances. If a backorder (due-out) already exists  for  the  full  authorized  bench  stock  quantity,  the  issue  request  will  be killed.  Bench  stock  backorders  will  only  be  created  for  the  full  authorized quantity.  When  a  due-out  is  created  as  a  result  of  a  partial  issue  being processed  by  the  ILS-S,  the  bench  stock  due-out  will  be  created  for  the  full authorized quantity. For each bench stock backorder, the cumulative recurring demand (CRD) field is updated on the master bench stock detail. 5.3.12.11.5.1.2.  Other  Asset  Notice.  When  an  issue  request  is  not  satisfied and available items may be suitable, a management notice is produced. If any or all of the items are acceptable, reprocess the bench stock issue request with TEX  “C”.  See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  7  for  more  information  on processing  I023  Management  Notices.  The  use  of  this  TEX  code  will  allow available assets to be issued in place of the originally requested item(s). AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 199 5.3.12.11.6.  Unsuitable  Substitutes.  when  substitute  items  are  available,  but  cannot be  used,  process  issue  requests  for  the  usable  item  only;  these  issues  may  be identified as bench stock by using the mark-for field serial number portion to identify the line number, e.g. BS00433. 5.3.12.11.7.  Cancellation  of  Due-Outs.  When  a master  bench  stock  detail  is  deleted by processing a Bench Stock Record/EOQ Delete (2BSD) transaction, the IT system will  automatically  cancel  any  existing  due-out  with  the  same  stock  number, organization and shop codes. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5, Master Bench Stock Record/EOQ Delete Transaction for specific ILS-S information and processing. 5.3.12.11.8.  Lack of Funds. When insufficient funds exist for the requested item, the due-out is killed and a management notice (lack of funds) is produced. See AFH 23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  7  for  resolution  of  Input  Exceeds  Project  FMR  Fund  Balance rejects. 5.3.12.11.9.  Due-Out  Release  Procedures.  On-base  due-out  release  of  items  for bench  stocks  will  be  delivered  by  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  to  the organizational bench stock delivery location. 5.3.12.12.  Bench  Stock  Review  Requirements  and  Responsibilities.  The  bench  stock review  process  is  designed  to  ensure  bench  stocks  are  regularly  updated  in  a  way  that maximizes mission support. 5.3.12.12.1.  Three-Phase  Review  Process.  The  bench  stock  review  will  be  made  in three  separate  phases--monthly  and  semiannually  for  regular  bench  stock,  and annually for standard reporting designator (SRD) and minimum reserve authorization. The semiannual review may be discontinued with the concurrence of the LRS CC/AO and the supported organizations. 5.3.12.12.1.1.  Phase  I  --Monthly  Recommended  Additions,  Changes,  and Deletions.  Bench  stock  will  be  reviewed  monthly  for  additions,  changes,  and deletions.  Items  recommended  by  IT  system  are  based  upon  past  issue  and  due-out release action. Coordination with affected bench stock account representatives will be effected prior to changes being made. This requirement may be changed to quarterly at the option of the major command. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for  instructions  on  processing  the  Bench  Stock  Review  listing  on  a  quarterly basis. 5.3.12.12.1.2.  Phase II--Semiannual Bench Stock Review. The Customer Support Liaison  Element  will  arrange  a  semiannual  joint  review  meeting  with  bench stock-supported-shops (determined jointly by the LRS CC/AO and the supported organization commander or Maintenance Chief). (T-1). 5.3.12.12.1.3.  Phase III--Annual SRD/MRA Validation. SRD data and minimum reserve authorization levels must be validated annually. Bench stock demands are identified  to  mission  requirements  only  if  proper  SRD  data  are  loaded.  MRA levels may no longer be valid resulting in erroneous stock control practices. After phase II of the review has been completed, the following actions are required: 5.3.12.12.1.3.1.  The  Customer  Support  Liaison  Element,  Decentralized 200 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Supply  Support/Materiel  Control  and  the  appropriate  shop  supervisor  will participate  in  the  joint  review  meeting.  (T-1).  Air  Force  approved  Adhoc Database  system  script  will  be  run  to  identify  bench  stock  NSNs  with  zero item record demands and zero item record cumulative demands.  During these reviews,  bench  stock  details  identified  via  the  Air  Force  approved  Adhoc Database  system  script  will  be  deleted  unless  a  letter  is  submitted  by  the Maintenance Superintendent justifying retention.  The semiannual review may be  discontinued  with  the  concurrence  of  the  LRS  CC/AO  and  the  supported organization  commander,  but  must  be  conducted  at  least  annually.  (T-2). Credit  may  be  granted  for  bench  stock  turn-ins  for  lateral  support  and  for items from non-flying hour accounts for which there are a positive enterprise positive  enterprise  demand  with  less  than  3  years  stock  on-hand  within  the enterprise. 5.3.12.12.1.3.2.  Processing  of  the  Organizational  Bench  Stock  Listing  is  not required  when  this  review  does  not  take  place,  but  may  be  processed  when requested  by  the  Customer  Support  Liaison  Element  supervisor.  This paragraph may be supplemented if local/MAJCOM requires this review to be accomplished more frequently. The review should not conflict with normally busy periods, such as end of month. Close coordination with the scheduler is needed to set the processing date for the semiannual review. 5.3.12.12.1.3.3.  All  bench stocks will be  replenished within 15 days of their scheduled  semiannual  reviews.  After  the  review  is  concluded  (within  one work  week),  normal  support  to  the  shops  will  be  resumed  as  quickly  as possible.  The  one-week  time  limit  may  be  extended  by  the  major  command for  distant/remote  off-base  supported  activities.  Also,  off-base  organizations may  be  reviewed  prior  to  on-base  organizations  to  eliminate  the  delay  in processing the Bench Stock Review. 5.3.12.12.1.3.4.  All  changes  and  recommended  deletions  will  be  reviewed during the joint review meeting, and the listing annotated as needed, and then signed  by  reviewing  participants.  (T-2).    The  Customer  Support  Liaison Element  will  keep  a  copy  of  the  signed  listing  until  the  next  review  is completed. (T-2). 5.3.12.12.1.3.5.  The  Customer  Support  Liaison  Element  will  provide  copies of the Organization Bench Stock Listing to the applicable shop supervisor and Materiel  Control  (after  all  necessary  actions  have  been  taken).  (T-2).The listing  assists  shop  personnel  in  the  location  of  bench  stock  items.  The Customer Support Liaison Element will also file a copy of the listing with the signed  listing  from  the  joint  review  meeting.  (T-2).  The  copy  of  the  listing produced after the semiannual review may be replaced if a new listing is run before  the  next  review.  A  thorough  review  is  extremely  important  to  ensure that bench stock supports the mission efficiently and economically. 5.3.12.12.1.3.6.  When  approved  by  the  LRS  CC/AO  and  the  supported organization commander or Maintenance Chief, the semi-annual joint review may be conducted by the following electronic means: AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 201 5.3.12.12.1.3.6.1.  LRS\Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  will initiate the ILS-S generation of the Organizational Bench Stock Listing and forward it to the appropriate individual using any electronic means. Current technology  will  allow  the  listing  to  be  sent  via  e-mail  to  the  bench  stock monitor  or  the  organization’s  electronic  mail  box.  Future  technology changes  that  allow  transfer  of  listing  will  also  be  acceptable  methods  of forwarding  the  listing.  The  LRS\Materiel  Management  Activity  Bench Stock Monitor will not  be the  chairperson  for  a  formal meeting, reviewing organizations will ensure special emphasis is placed on the following items: items with no demands in the past year and items with excessive quantities not supported by demands. 5.3.12.12.1.3.6.2.  The  review  should  not  conflict  with  normally  busy periods, such as end of month. Close coordination with AFMC scheduler is needed to set the processing date for the semiannual review. 5.3.12.12.1.3.6.3.  All  shops  will  be  replenished  within  15  days  of  their scheduled  semiannual  reviews.  After  the  review  is  concluded  (within  one work  week),  normal  support  to  the  shops  will  be  resumed  as  quickly  as possible. The one-week time limit may be extended by the major command for distant/remote off-base supported activities. Also, off-base organizations may  be  reviewed  prior  to  on-base  organizations  to  eliminate  the  delay  in processing the Bench Stock Review. 5.3.12.12.1.3.6.4.  All changes and recommended deletions will be reviewed during the electronic review, and the listing annotated as needed. The using organization  will  prepare  a  memo  for  the  record  to  be  signed  by  the reviewing participant. The memo will indicate the following data elements: date  the  Organizational  Bench  Stock  Listing  was  created;  date  review  was completed;  details  requiring  change;  required  change;  name;  rank;  and phone  number  of  individual(s)  conducting  the  review.  The  memo  will  be forwarded  to  Customer  Support  Liaison  who  will  make  the  indicated changes and maintain the signed memo until the next review is completed. (T-2). Memo may be filed electronically. 5.3.12.12.1.3.6.5.  Updated copies of the Organization Bench Stock  Listing will  be  provided  by  the  Customer  Support  Liaison  for  the  applicable  shop supervisor  and  Materiel  Control  (after  all  necessary  actions  have  been taken). A thorough review is extremely important to ensure that bench stock supports the mission efficiently and economically. 5.3.12.12.1.3.7.  The Customer Support Liaison must keep the funds manager informed  of  significant  increases  or  decreases  in  bench  stock  authorizations and  demands.  Organization  commanders  will  find  pertinent  financial information  included  in  each  organization's  bench  stock  listing.  No  bench stock  orders  will  be  filled  unless  funds  are  available  in  the  project  fund management record. 5.3.12.12.1.4.  Phase III--Annual SRD/MRA Validation. SRD data and minimum reserve authorization levels must be validated annually at the same time as one of 202 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 the  semiannual  bench  stock  reviews.  Bench  stock  demands  are  identified  to mission  requirements  only  if  proper  SRD  data  are  loaded.  MRA  levels  may  no longer be valid resulting in erroneous stock control practices. After phase II of the review has been completed, the following actions are required: 5.3.12.12.1.4.1.  A  digitally  signed  email  or  cover  letter  by  the  LRS  CC/AO must  accompany to Decentralized  Materiel  Support.  The  letter  will  request  a  review  of  all  SRD and  MRA  data.  There  must  also  be  a  reply  by  endorsement,  signed  by  the shop supervisor, to certify completion of the review (T-1). the  Organization  Bench  Stock  Listing  provided 5.3.12.12.1.4.2.  Changes  resulting  from  the  review  will  be  submitted  to  the Customer Support Liaison, who will update the master bench stock record (T-2). 5.3.12.12.1.4.3.  A  copy  of  the  signed  endorsement  will  be  filed  in  the Customer Support Liaison and used for verification of the annual review. (T-2). 5.3.12.13.  Bench Stock Issue Output Issue Document Format and Document Flow – DD Form 1348-1A. 5.3.12.13.1.  Bench Stock Issue Document Flow. See Bench Stock Issue Transaction in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for specific ILS-S information and processing. 5.3.12.13.1.1.  Customer  Support  Liaison.  Create  the  master  bench  stock  issue request for items requiring replenishment. 5.3.12.13.1.2.  Asset Management Section. 5.3.12.13.1.2.1.  Off-base issues. Select the property to be issued and enter the date  and  name  of  the  individual  selecting  the  property  on  line  29  of  the  DD Form  1348-1A.  Forward  property  with  DD  Form  1348-1A  attached  to transportation  for  shipment.  The  transportation  function  will  sign,  date,  and distribute the DD Form 1348-1A. (T-2). 5.3.12.13.1.2.2.  Bench stock issues. Select the property to be issued and enter the date and signature of the individual selecting the property on line 29 of the DD Form 1348-1A; notify the BSSS when property is ready for pickup. 5.3.12.13.1.3.  Place  property  and  any  corresponding  documentation  in  the Deployment and Distribution holding area for customer delivery. Refer to AFI 24-301 for additional information on delivery procedures. 5.3.12.13.1.4.  Management  Notice.  This  output  will  be  used  to  coordinate  with the customer if a substitute is available for issue. 5.3.12.14.  Deployment/Contingency  Bench  Stock  Support.  Bench  stock  support  at deployment/contingency locations is provided via CRSP.  In the event a weapon system operates  from  the  same  deployment/contingency  location  for  a  timeframe  sufficient  to establish  reliable  demand  patterns  within  ILS-S  and  the  weapon  system  is  expected  to continue operations at  the location in  the  foreseeable future, then  regular  organizational bench stocks can be established. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 203 5.3.12.14.1.  These  two  different  approaches  dictate  different  replenishment  actions. Be  aware  of  these  differences  and  take  every  effort  to  aid  or  assist  in  the  timely replenishment  of  consumables.  These  represent  the  majority  of  bits  and  pieces, attaching parts and hardware. 5.3.12.14.2.  Items  included  in  the  RSP  will  be  ordered  under  normal  procedures  as they are expensed (used.) 5.3.12.14.3.  Bench  Stock  Review.  Bench  Stock  should  begin  immediate  review  of deploying units' bench stock. If it is a short notice deployment (60 days or less), the above actions are still advised but must be compressed within the given time. 5.3.12.14.3.1.  Close and continuous coordination with the supported organization to check and double check bench stock adds and deletes is essential. 5.3.12.14.3.2.  Initiate priority action to fill bench stocks according to established procedures. 5.3.12.14.3.3.  Initiate  priority  action  on  bench  stock  due-out  line  items  that  the deploying organization identifies as necessary for deployment. 5.3.12.15.  Bin Labels. 5.3.12.15.1.  Bench  stock  bin  labels  are  produced  via  the  ILS-S  upon  request.  Bin labels are automatically produced for new bench stock items and when existing bench stock  records  are  changed.  Bin  labels  for  items  with  a  shelf  life  are  colored,  to distinguish  those  items  from  non-deteriorating  items.  See  Daily  Bin  Labels (D38/NGV837) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for additional details about bench stock label printing options. In some locations, bench stock items are managed by the use of automated information technology (AIT) equipment (hand-held terminals) that record the information stored on bin labels. 5.3.12.15.2.  Process  this  report  using  ES-S.  Reference  the  ES-S  User’s  Manual  on the ES-S CoP. The purpose of this report is to provide bin labels for all item record warehouse  locations,  bench  stock  operations,  supply  point,  equipment,  retail  sales, SPRAM, mission support and war reserve type items. 5.3.13.  Shelf Life Item Control. 5.3.13.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  shelf  life  procedures  process.  For  policy  specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.3.13.2.  Shelf life management procedures are contained in DoD 4140.27-M and will be followed  for  stocking,  storing  and  issuing  shelf  life  designated  material.  Specific guidance  is  given  in  this  chapter  and  will  be  used  along  with  DoD  4140.27-M  at  AF activities. 5.3.13.2.1.  Designation.  Items  assigned  a  National  Stock  Number  (NSN)  in  the Federal  Supply  System  will  be  designated  by  a  specific  shelf  life  code.  This  code identifies  length  of  the  shelf  life  period.  All  NSNs  or  National  Item  Identification Number  (NIINs)  not  designated  as  shelf  life  items  IAW  DoD  4140.27-M  are considered to be non-deteriorative and, thus, are not managed as shelf life items and shall be coded and identified by shelf life code 0 (zero). 204 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.3.13.3.  Shelf Life Management and Programs. 5.3.13.3.1.  Storage. Shelf life items should be consolidated in one central stockroom or warehouse to the maximum extent possible. Consolidation will facilitate efficiency during  inspection  or  surveillance  actions  by  reducing  the  amount  of  travel  time between locations. It is not necessary to segregate shelf life items from other assets in storage. 5.3.13.3.1.1.  Report  any  item  in  storage  that  appears  to  be  deteriorating  and excluded from the shelf life control procedures to the responsible item manager to evaluate if the item should be assigned a shelf life code. 5.3.13.3.1.2.  Item(s)  may  be  unsuitable  for  intended  use  at  the  expiration  of  the assigned storage time. Users need to ensure not to confuse Shelf Life and Service Life. Shelf Life is the time the item sits “on the shelf” prior to issue or after issue and  not  in  use.  The  service  life  is  determined  by  appropriate  TO,  Commercial Manuals, or other documentation. For example, a tire might have a shelf life code of  “S”  (60  months).  This  does  not  mean  you  replace  a  “in  use”  tire  every  60 months. The service life of the tire might be 10 years. When the tire has been on the shelf for 60 months and has not been used the shelf life code (SLC) will apply because  requirements  in  tactical  situations  when  mission  success  could  be jeopardized by failure and lives could be lost during combat when assets have sat “on  the  shelf”.  Users  may  challenge  any  SLC  if  they  feel  items  are  improperly coded. 5.3.13.3.1.3.  Identification  on  Labels.  Warehouse  personnel  must  make  sure  the label on each item, subject to shelf life management, clearly states the expiration date.  (T-1).  Activities  using  items  with  short  shelf  lives  are  authorized,  on  an optional basis, to use a color-coding system making expiration dates more readily apparent.  One  system  is  to  have  two  sets  of  decals  like  those  used  on  vehicle license  plates.  Each  set  is  a  different  color  to  designate  the  current  year  and  the next year. Each color would have decals with numbers from 1 to 12 to designate the month of expiration. 5.3.13.3.1.3.1.  Chemical  Warfare  Defense  Equipment  (CWDE).  Individual Protective  Equipment  assets  that  qualify  for  shelf  life  extension  must  be clearly  marked  with  the  latest  discard/expiration  date  and  will  be  clearly remarked with new discard/ expiration date. This can be done by marking out the  old  data  and  hand  writing  in  new  data,  or  use  of  DD  Form  2477.  Note: Property  previously  identified  with  AF  Form  2032,  Inspection  Extension (rescinded) must now be identified using a DD Form 2477. AFTO Form 152, Chemical  Defense  Ensemble  Inspection  Record/DD  Form  1574  to  show updated  extended  shelf  life  is  an  acceptable  method  of  update.  Assets "without"  a  marked  discard/expiration  date  will  not  require  individual marking  of  extended  shelf  life.  Along  with  the  guidance  above,  Mobility  IT System will be updated for all assets with extension data. 5.3.13.3.2.  Maximum  Use  of  Stock.  Issues  of  shelf  life  stocks  should  be  directed against the oldest stocks (those with the least shelf life remaining). Storage activities shall  initiate  controls  to  minimize  expiration  of  materiel  in  storage  by  issuing  first AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 205 those stocks which have the earliest  expiration date for Type  I items; or  the earliest date  manufactured,  date  packed,  date  cured,  or  date  assembled  for  Type  II  items, except  where  issue  of  newer  stocks  is  justified.  (T-1).  Under  normal  circumstances, this policy prescribes for a strict application of first-in/first-out  (FIFO) issue control techniques. 5.3.13.3.2.1.  Exceptions. The only exception to this policy is issues (transfers) to mission  support  kit  (MSK)/mobility  readiness  spares  package  (MRSP)/war reserve material (WRM) where the newest stock is released. Under no conditions will warehouse personnel  issue an item  that has  reached or passed its expiration date. Immediately notify inspection personnel when an item with an expired shelf life  date  is  discovered  in  stock.  Inspection  personnel  will  immediately  begin  a complete review of all assets on hand for that stock number. 5.3.13.3.2.2.  Time  compliance  technical  order  (TCTO)  kits  containing  shelf-life items will be assigned a shelf-life code of the shortest shelf-life item in the kit. 5.3.13.3.2.3.  Overseas  Shipments.  All  items  for  overseas  shipment  will  be selected  from  the  newest  stock  (longest  remaining  shelf-life).  Refer  to  AFMAN 23-122 for requirements concerning overseas shipments (OCONUS). 5.3.13.3.3.  Internal Controls. To control items in storage, Inspection personnel do the following: 5.3.13.3.3.1.  Query the ILS-S to list the item records for all items assigned shelf life  codes  (See  ES-S  User’s  Manual  and/or  AFH  23-123,  Vol  1,  Ch  2)  for additional information on shelf life codes ). This program may also be processed to  select  specific  shelf  life  codes,  as  required.  This  option  should  be  used  to frequently monitor items assigned short shelf life codes. 5.3.13.3.3.1.1.  Physically check each location for the following: 5.3.13.3.3.1.2.  Bin label attached to and matches property in location. 5.3.13.3.3.1.3.  Ensure using first-in/first-out (FIFO) issue control techniques. 5.3.13.3.3.1.4.  Verify shelf life and expiration date. 5.3.13.3.3.1.5.  Ensure  items  are  in  original  packing  with  manufacturer  label for Type I. Type II must have a manufacturer label or DD Form 2477. Note: Manufacturer label must be clear and legible. 5.3.13.3.3.1.6.  Color  coding  bin  labels.  On  an  optional  basis,  warehouse personnel  can  use  a  color-coding  system  to  making  shelf  life  and  expiration dates  more  readily  apparent.  One  system  is  to  have  two  sets  of  decals  like those used on vehicle license plates. Each set is a different color to designate the  current  year  and  the  next  year.  Each  color  would  have  decals  with numbers from 1 to 12 to designate the month of expiration. 5.3.13.3.3.2.  Annotate the listing to indicate items are outdated or require issue or disposition before the next inspection. 5.3.13.3.3.3.  Retain the annotated listing(s) until new products are produced. 206 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.3.13.3.4.  DoD Shelf Life Program Website. The DoD Shelf Life program has both a  secure  and  non-secure  website.  These  sites  contain  access  to  the  Shelf  Life Extension  System  (SLES)  and  other  management  information.  The  secure  site  is available at located https://headquarters.dla.mil/j-3/shelflife.  The  non-secure  site located  at: http://www.shelflife.hq.dla.mil. customers  without is is a  password and to .mil 5.3.13.3.5.  Shelf-Life  Extension  System  (SLES).  AF  personnel  will  utilize  SLES  to determine  whether  shelf-life  materiel  has  been  tested  by  a  certified  laboratory  and extended IAW DoD 4140.27-M. 5.3.13.3.5.1.  Quality  Status  Listing  (QSL).  AF  storage  activities  may  utilize  the test  results  in  the  QSL  to  extend  the  shelf-life  or  dispose  of  specified  items  as indicated. The QSL is available to “.mil” customers on the SLES secure site. To extend the shelf-life based on the test results in the QSL, the items on hand must equate to the same stock number, contract, lot, and/or batch number as listed. For items not appearing on the QSL, contact the appropriate ICP Shelf-Life Point of Contact for assistance. Note: QSL test results are based upon compliance with the mandated DoD/AF storage standards. Therefore, storage activities must take into consideration  local  storage  conditions  prior  to  extending/disposing  of  shelf-life assets. 5.3.13.3.6.  Acting  in  the  role  of  AF  Executive  Agent,  the  Warner  Robins  Air Logistics Complex shares the responsibility of testing shelf-life items with other DoD components and helps assure update and operation of the data in the SLES. 5.3.13.4.  DELETED 5.3.13.5.  Shelf Life Codes. 5.3.13.5.1.  Assigning  Shelf  Life  Codes.  Items  assigned  shelf  life  codes  are  divided into categories as follows: 5.3.13.5.1.1.  Type  I  (alpha  codes).  Type  I  (alpha  codes)  are  assigned  to  items having a definite, non-extendable shelf life. 5.3.13.5.1.1.1.  Type  I  shelf  life  items  will  not  be  tested,  inspected,  or extended  in  storage.  These  assets  will  be  downgraded  from  condition  codes "A,"  to  "B,"  to  "C,"  to  "H,"  in  accordance  with  the  specified  condition  code timeframes located in DoD 4140.27M. 5.3.13.5.1.1.2.  For  all  shelf  life  assets  other  than  cure  dated  items,  the manufactured  date,  assembled  date,  packed  date,  expiration  date,  and  the inspect/test date shall be expressed by the numeric month followed by the last two digits of the calendar year, with the day of the month being the last day. When  two  or  more  unit  packs  of  identical  items  have  different  beginning  or ending  shelf-life  dates,  the  earliest  ending  date,  i.e.  expiration  or  inspect/test shall be the date used. Note: Example, the date of 12/03 would be December 2003 and the inspection/expiration date would be the 31st of December 2003. The  31st  would  be  the  use  to  date  and  the  item  could  have  a  longer  service date. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 207 5.3.13.5.1.2.  Type  II  (numeric  codes).  Type  II  (numeric  codes)  are  assigned  to items  having  a  shelf  life  which  may  be  extended  after  the  completion  of inspection, testing, or restoration, as appropriate. An item may be extended for the full term of its original life unless TOs or other publications prevent it. 5.3.13.5.1.2.1.  For  Type  II  extendible  shelf  life  items,  materiel  requiring visual inspection will be inspected 6 months prior to the inspection test date. Materiel  requiring  laboratory  testing  shall  be  tested  9  months  prior  to  the inspect/test  date,  while  the  item  is  still  in  condition  code  A.  Prior  to  testing, the QSL shall be checked to determine if the item has already been tested and extended.  For  materiel  requiring  laboratory  testing  which  is  stored  at  an intermediate or LRS/Materiel Management Activity, the storage activity may test  materiel  locally  in  a  certified  lab  or  contact  the  managing  ICP  shelf  life focal point DoD 4140.27M for a list of approved certified labs. 5.3.13.5.1.2.1.1.  When  submitting  Type  II  shelf  life  materiel  to  a  testing laboratory,  it  is  important  that  the  batch,  lot,  and  contract  numbers  are annotated on all documentation/property that is  being sent  for testing. This requirement applies to materiel from the warehouse that needs to be tested, as  well  as  the  materiel  in  depot  maintenance  support  centers.  This information is required so that the test results reported in the SLES product can be used accurately. In cases where the contract number is not available, the materiel can still be tested and extended if test parameters are met. 5.3.13.6.  Testing and Inspections. 5.3.13.6.1.  Shelf-Life  Testing  Costs.  The  basic  premise  is  the  organization  owning the  material  pays  for  the  testing.  When  the  customer  owning  the  material  is  from another AF Base, another Service, another Agency, etc. they are responsible to fund any costs related to the testing of shelf-life assets. When the material is owned by a local manufacturing production organization, the testing lab gets paid by the expense incurred  testing  the  material  being  charged  back  to  the  organization  owning  the material. 5.3.13.6.1.1.  Lab  testing  is  necessary  prior  to  issue  or  shipment  of  items exceeding  shelf  life  expiration  dates.  When  lab  testing  is  not  required,  check requirements IAW applicable Technical Order (TO). 5.3.13.6.1.2.  After  Type  II  shelf  life  materiel  is  inspected  or  tested  and  then extended to a new inspection or test date, a DD Form 2477, shall be attached to the outside container of each item in a conspicuous place at the storage location. 5.3.13.6.1.3.  Natural  or  synthetic  rubber  components,  bearings,  lubricants,  etc., should be replaced when necessary, as well as any other reconditioning required to  return  the  item  to  a  serviceable  condition  prior  to  issue  or  shipment  if  the assigned storage time has elapsed. 5.3.13.6.1.4.  Petroleum  Products.  Petroleum  products  are  managed  IAW  TO 42B-1-1,  and  AFI  23-204,  Organizational  Fuel  Tanks.  Quality  control  of petroleum  products  and  chemicals  will  be  inspected  visually  or  retested  as specified in TO 42C-1-12. (T-0). 208 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.3.13.6.1.4.1.  Contact AF Petroleum (AFPET) Office at Ft. Belvoir, VA. for petroleum  product  retest  information  or  disposition  instructions.  Information can also be obtained through the AF Petroleum Office via the AF Portal. 5.3.13.6.1.5.  Aircraft  jet  engine  oils,  MIL-L-7808L,  Performance  Specification; Lubricating Oil, Aircraft Turbine Engine, Synthetic Base and MIL-L-23699, must be used within 36 months of the date of packaging or the date of the last test. To prevent  unnecessary  testing,  the  QSL  published  by  DLA  may  be  used  to  obtain test data. 5.3.13.6.1.5.1.  Bases maintaining large inventories of aircraft and engine oils as WRM may have difficulty rotating stocks in peacetime, when demands are low.  Accordingly,  12  months  before  the  product's  expiration  date,  bases should submit requests for assistance in redistributing stock. AF bases unable to  rotate  stocks  adequately  may  use  advice  code  2G  when  requisitioning  to DLA. 5.3.13.6.1.6.  Containers, Drums, Tanks, Lines, and Associated Equipment. Local checklists  will  be  developed  to  ensure  that  containers,  drums,  tanks,  lines,  and associated  equipment  are  inspected  monthly.  The  ILS-S  listings  or  a  suitable program  may  be  used  to  assist  in  these  inspections.  Checklists  will  indicate specific  storage  areas  where  chemicals  are  stored,  location  of  tanks  and  lines where applicable, and location or serial numbers of associated equipment used in the  chemical  storage  operation.  The  result  of  the  monthly  inspections  will  be documented on the checklist and maintained for a minimum of one year. 5.3.13.6.1.7.  XD/XF Assets. All Type II shelf life ERRC designator XD (T) and XF (P) items must undergo a 100% test or inspection. These items will require a bench  or  functional  check  to  ensure  serviceability;  therefore  all  affected  assets must be checked. 5.3.13.6.1.8.  Critical  Supplies.  Shelf  life  items  that  are  in  a  critical  supply position will be tested and extended in stock when appropriate; regardless of the dollar  value  of  the  materiel  involved.  Item  criticality  will  be  determined  by coordination  with  the  appropriate  AF  activity  with  engineering  authority  assigns the shelf life code having responsibility for the item. 5.3.13.6.1.9.  Possession  of  Shelf  Life.  Inspections  shall  be  the  responsibility  of the  activity  having  custody  of  a  shelf  life  item.  Units  shall  be  responsible  and accountable  for  shelf  life  inspection  on  materiel  that  has  been  issued  to  them. Supply activities shall be responsible and accountable for shelf life inspection on materiel  in  their  possession.  The  materiel  management  activity  should  request assistance from a maintenance activity (user) when they need services or advice to accomplish the inspection or to evaluate the test results. The following procedures will assist with these circumstances: 5.3.13.6.1.9.1.  Process  a  condition  change transfer  outdated serviceable  items  to  unserviceable  details  when  the  item  is  to  be  issued  to Maintenance  for  serviceability  check,  or  there  will  be  a  delay  in  processing the item to disposal. input to AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 209 5.3.13.6.1.9.2.  Maintenance  personnel  will  forward  written  results  of  their test findings and the items not used or consumed in testing. 5.3.13.6.1.9.3.  Maintenance  will  return  items  not  consumed  but  tested unserviceable. Inspection personnel will process a return for the total quantity of the items not consumed but tested unserviceable. 5.3.13.6.1.9.4.  Maintenance will tag those items tested and found serviceable and their expiration dates will be extended according to this manual. 5.3.13.6.1.9.5.  Inspection personnel will process a return for the quantity used or consumed during testing. 5.3.13.6.1.9.5.1.  The unserviceable document will be stamped or typed with the  following  statement:  Property  Reflected  On  This  Document  Has  Been Consumed During Routine Testing IAW (applicable directive). 5.3.13.6.1.9.5.2.  The ILS-S document will be signed and dated by the chief inspector or his/her designee and forwarded to Document Control. Attach a copy of the written test results to provide an audit trail. 5.3.13.6.1.9.5.3.  Items  consistently  failing  to  meet  test  requirements  and have  been  properly  stored  should  be  reported  to  the  appropriate  Item Management organization for assessment of the assigned shelf life or use of an alternate source of supply. 5.3.13.7.  Processing  Outdated  Shelf  Life  Items.  Under  no  conditions  will  warehouse personnel  issue  an  item  which  has  reached  or  passed  its  expiration  date.  Immediately notify inspection personnel when an item with an expired shelf life date is discovered in stock.  Inspection  personnel  will  immediately  begin  a  complete  review  of  all  assets  on hand for that stock number. 5.3.13.7.1.  Type I Shelf Life Items. When type I shelf life items are outdated, process a  condition  change  to  change  the  condition  to  H  (condemned)  for  an  automatic transfer to DLADS. 5.3.13.7.2.  Type II Shelf Life Items. Type II shelf life items will be tested 15-45 days before  the  expiration  date.  The  QSL  maintained  by  DLA  under  the  SLES  program will be checked before any local testing is initiated. Testing is required when the on-hand  balance  for  the  affected  batch/lot  indicates  the  materiel  will  remain  in  stock beyond the expiration. Decisions to test are based on the normal utilization rate and/or demand pattern for the affected item. If the materiel cannot be tested while it is still in condition code A, this materiel shall be allowed to migrate to condition codes B, C, or J, until the laboratory test results or disposition instructions are received. 5.3.13.7.2.1.  Processing  Type  II  Expired  Shelf  Life  Items.  Process  a  condition change  input  to  change  the  condition  code  to  J  (suspend  outdated  items  on  an unserviceable  detail).  When  the  item  is  to  be  issued  to  maintenance  for  a serviceability  test  or  when  there  is  a  delay  in  processing.  Issue  unserviceable items to maintenance using ILS-S controls for monitoring. 5.3.13.7.2.2.  Test Findings. The Maintenance function forwards a written reply of the  test  finding(s),  along  with  any  materiel  not  used  or  destroyed  in  testing,  to 210 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Inspection. 5.3.13.7.2.2.1.  Item Destroyed During Testing. If the item was destroyed as a result of testing, Inspection processes a return with supply condition code of H and  action  taken  code  of  9.  This  action  will  generate  a  transfer  document  to DLADS. Returns are processed using the original issue document numbers to make certain all due-in from maintenance (DIFM) details are deleted. 5.3.13.7.2.2.1.1.  Stamp, type or hand scribe the following statement on the transfer  document:  Property  Reflected  On  This  Document  Has  Been Consumed During Routine Testing IAW (applicable directive). 5.3.13.7.2.2.1.2.  The  Chief  Inspector  or  designee  signs  and  date  the document before forwarding it to Document Control. A copy of the written test result(s) will be attached to provide an audit trail. 5.3.13.7.2.3.  Tested  Unserviceable.  Materiel  not  consumed  and tested unserviceable is processed in the same manner as above, but the resulting transfer document and the unserviceable item are forwarded to DLADS. 5.3.13.7.2.4.  Tested  Serviceable.  Items  tested  and  found  serviceable  are  tagged and their expiration dates are extended according to instructions in this section. 5.3.13.7.3.  Exception  to  Type  II  Shelf  Life  Testing.  When  small  quantities  of  the same stock number reach their expiration date, the Chief Inspector must determine if testing of this material is cost effective. Testing should not be done when the cost of the  test  is  greater  than  the  total  dollar  value  of  the  outdated  materiel,  or  when  only one unit remains and the materiel will be consumed in testing. See DoD 4140.27-M, para 4.11 for specific policy guidance. 5.3.13.8.  Shipping.  Source  of  Supply  activities  should  utilize  the  following  criteria  to ensure that shelf life items arrive at their destination with adequate serviceable shelf life remaining.  Once  the  Type  II  materiel  is  received,  it  becomes  the  receiver's  (i.e.,  retail, end  user)  responsibility  to  inspect  the  materiel  and  ensure  that  extension  information  is available  or  submit  an  SDR  if  information  is  not  current  and  not  available  in  the  QSL. Subsequently,  the  receiver  will  ensure  that  extension  markings  are  current  and  remark accordingly. Costly DLADS/hazardous waste disposal of Type II shelf-life items/materiel solely  on  the  basis  that  the  inspect/test  date  markings  on  the  shipment  container  had lapsed  when  received  would  most  likely  be  premature  and  is  unauthorized  without conducting the appropriate research. Shipping expired shelf-life materiel to any customer is prohibited. 5.3.13.8.1.  Continental United States (CONUS) Shipments. 5.3.13.8.1.1.  Items with less than 90 days of shelf life remaining (condition code "C")  may  only  be  issued  for  immediate  usage  --  priority  designator  01-08 requisitions. 5.3.13.8.1.2.  Items with three to six months shelf-life remaining (condition code "B")  may  be  shipped  to  CONUS  contractors'  facilities  for  use  as  government furnished  property  (GFP)  or  government  furnished  materiel  (GFM)  and  to  other CONUS requisitioner's for stock and reissue. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 211 5.3.13.8.2.  Overseas  Shipments.  All including shipments under security assistance programs, will be selected from the newest stock (longest remaining shelf-life). The minimum requirements are outlined below. These three paragraphs are quoted from DoD 4140.27-M. items  for  overseas  shipment, 5.3.13.8.2.1.  Items with an SLC of 24 months or greater, issued to satisfy either overseas or ILP requirements shall be in condition code A, with a minimum of 12 months shelf life remaining. Requisitioners may waive the 12-month minimum by submitting exception requisitions. Items with an SLC of less than 24 months are not subject to the 12-month minimum. They must be issued from condition code A assets, unless the customer specifies that other than condition code a materiel is acceptable.  OCONUS  requisitions  may  be  identified  by  Document  Identifier Codes  (DIC)  A01,  A02,  A03,  A04,  or  A05  in  record  position  1-3  of  the requisition.  ILP  requisitions  are  identified  by  the  following  Military  Standard Requisitioning  And  Issue  Procedures  (MILSTRIP)  service  codes  in  record position  30:  B  (Army  FMS),  D  (AF  FMS),  K  (Marine  Corps  FMS),  P  (Navy FMS), or T (DLA FMS). 5.3.13.8.2.2.  In  addition  to  the  above,  ILP  requisitions  will  be  issued  in accordance with Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) policy. LIFO issues of Type I shelf life items  will  be  accomplished  by  issue  of  materiel  with  the  most  current  date  of expiration. Type II items will be issued by the most current date of manufacture, cured, assembly, or date packed (subsistence only), regardless of exceptions. 5.3.13.8.3.  For  AF  managed  items.  Condition  Code  B  materiel  may  be  issued  for priority 01-08 AF FMS requisitions.” 5.3.13.8.4.  Requisitioners may specify the shipment of only the newest stock to meet strategic  mission  requirements  by  utilizing  Military  Standard  Requisitioning  and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) advice code "2G." 5.3.13.8.5.  The  IMMs  have  the  capability  to  supplement  the  advice  codes  indicated in the customer's requisition or when instructing storage activities to deviate from the FIFO principle by the use of Military Standard Reporting and Accounting Procedure (MILSTRAP)  management  codes.  These  codes  are  to  be  used  only  to  supplement information  conveyed  by  the  condition  code  on  the  materiel  release  order.  The  two MILSTRAP management codes are defined as follows: Code "T" - Issue newest stock only. Code "U" - Issue stock having at least one-year shelf life remaining. 5.3.13.9.  Excess, Disposal and Reutilization of Shelf Life Assets. 5.3.13.9.1.  All  AF  units  shall  report  all  excess  on-hand  quantities  to  the  Integrated Materiel  Manager  (IMM).  (T-1).  All  efforts  will  be  made  to  redistribute  potentially expiring shelf life assets. 5.3.13.9.2.  Final disposal action should be the absolute last resort for shelf life items that  have,  for  example:  (1)  expired  or  (2)  will  not  be  extended  due  to  visual inspection/laboratory are  not  Hazardous  Material (hazmat)/Hazardous  Waste  (hw).  Using  discretion  and  common  sense,  in  terms  of Environment, Safety And Occupational Health (ESOH) considerations, there may be circumstances where use of these items may be diverted to completely non-critical or failure test and (3) 212 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 non-tactical  applications  as  opposed  to  disposal.  Alternative  uses  should  be coordinated with ESOH authority and facilities maintenance. 5.3.13.9.3.  Challenging a SLC Assignment. Challenges shall be written, coordinated within  the  challenging  service/agency  prior  to  routing  to  the  AF  activity  with engineering  authority  that  assigns  the  shelf  life  code,  and  coordinated  with  the remaining  services/agencies  prior  to  service  implementation.  Shelf  life  assignments are  based  on  optimum  storage  conditions  and  the  exact  rates  of  deterioration  or degradation  are  unknowns,  shelf  life  items  must  be  closely  monitored  and  visually inspected prior to use. When the items are still good even where stored under adverse conditions,  the  scenario  presents  an  opportunity  to  challenge  the  shelf  life  code assignment. 5.3.13.9.4.  Retail  activities will dispose of  expired items  and  redistribute/dispose of excess  items  as  needed.  When  serviceable  items  become  unserviceable  due  to expiration  of  a  shelf  life  component,  a  determination  will  be  made  as  to  whether  a firm or future stock level requirement still exists for the item. If so, the item will be tagged with a DD Form 1576 or DD Form 1576-1, Test/Modification Label Materiel and forwarded to maintenance for local repair or evacuation. Section 5D—Equipment Management 5.4.  Equipment Management. 5.4.1.  Organizational Visits. 5.4.1.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  procedural  processes  to  conduct  organizational  visits. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS). 5.4.1.2.  General  Discussion: The EAE is  responsible for ensuring proper  accountability of  in-use  equipment,  equipment  items  marked  with  a  Unique  Item  Identifier  (UII), equipment  custodians  properly  conduct  their  duties,  and  squadron  commanders  or designated  representative  are  provided  feedback  concerning  equipment  accountability. The  EAE  assists  unit  property  custodians  with  equipment  issues,  perform  base  level equipment management functions and perform scheduled organizational visits. See MIL-STD-130  for  IUID  instructions.  Note:  MAJCOMS  are  authorized  to  modify  these instructions  for  wings  with  contracted  or  Most  Efficient  Organization  (MEO)  LRS’s  if organizational  visits  will  significantly  increase  the  cost  of  current  contracts  or  MEO manpower until such contracts are due to be competed or renewed. The unit will provide their MAJCOM/A4R  with  a waiver request  that  includes reason(s) they  cannot  comply, their proposed alternative method to ensure equipment accountability and a projected get well  date.  MAJCOMs/wings  will  add  associated  EAE  tasks  to  contracts  as  they  are competed or renewed. 5.4.1.3.  The following actions will be performed: 5.4.1.3.1.  Schedule and conduct annual organizational visits to ensure custodians are performing  their  accountability  responsibilities.  Document  the  visit  results  and provide to the squadron commander /designated representative with recommendations for corrective actions. The EAE will check the following areas: AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 213 5.4.1.3.1.1.  Ensure  accountable  equipment  items  that  are  verified  as  directed below  are  marked  with  a  Unique  Item  Identifier  (IUID)  and  Unique  Item Identifier  (UII)  label  is  serviceable,  readable,  and  associated  with  the  correct equipment data within AFEMS. 5.4.1.3.1.2.  Verify  accountability  of  all  capital  equipment  assets  and  ensure documentation is available to support valuation. 5.4.1.3.1.3.  Verify  accountability  of  Nuclear  Weapons  Related  Material (NWRM) equipment IAW AFI 20-110. 5.4.1.3.1.4.  EAE will verify accountability of COMSEC/CCI equipment. 5.4.1.3.1.4.1.  All  COMSEC/CCI  will  be  visually  verified  and  counted  by serial number except as noted in paragraph below. 5.4.1.3.1.4.2.  Verification  and  count  of  installed,  loaned,  or  deployed COMSEC/CCI assets on accountable records: COMSEC installed on-weapon systems (e.g. missiles, aircraft) will not be disassembled for the sole purpose of serial number (SN) verification. COMSEC loaned or deployed will also not be  returned  for  the  sole  purpose  of  serial  number  (SN)  verification.  These assets will be inventoried by records check. 5.4.1.3.1.4.3.  Validate  assets  received  via  (SF)  153,  COMSEC  Material Report,  are  recorded  in  the  APSR  as  prescribed  in  AFI  33-201  Volume  1, Communication Security and Volume 2, COMSEC User Requirements. 5.4.1.3.1.5.  Spot check a random 10% sample (per account) of the organization’s remaining accountable in-use equipment to ensure it is on hand. 5.4.1.3.1.6.  Verify  the  unit  has  a  process  to  account  for  pilferable  items purchased  with  the  government  purchase  card.  Units  can  account  for  pilferable assets  (i.e.,  digital  cameras,  projection  equipment)  via the  use  of  an Organizational  Visibility  List  or  locally  developed  product.  Validate  that equipment  items  that  meet  the  criteria  for  accountability  on  Equipment Authorized  In-Use  Details  (EAID)  are  not  accounted  for  on  the  Organizational Visibility List or locally developed product. 5.4.1.3.2.  Provide  organizational  commander  or  responsible  officer  with  a  written status  report  of  the  organizational  visit  signed  by  the  LRS  CC/AO.  Include  on  this report, strengths, findings and observations. 5.4.1.3.3.  Review  and  validate  the  responsible  officer’s  replies  to  the  report’s findings and determines if the actions taken are sufficient to correct the deficiencies. If the discrepancies are not resolved within 30 calendar days, notify the LRS CC/AO, the responsible officer’s group and wing commander, in writing. 5.4.1.3.4.  Measure  schedule  effectiveness to  ensure  organizational  visits  are completed annually and reported to the LRS CC/AO monthly during how-goes-it or equivalent briefings.5.4.2. Allowance Standards (AS). 5.4.2.1.  Purpose: To explain AS and their use with Equipment Management. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-214 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 123,  Vol  2  (ILS-S)  and  Vol  3  (AFEMS).  AS’s  are  available  online  in  AFEMS.  The following is guidance for the application of AS’s: 5.4.2.2.  AS’s  prescribe  the  master  item  in  the  Interchangeable  and  Substitute  (I&S) subgroup. 5.4.2.3.  ERRCD and AS. 5.4.2.3.1.  Generally,  only  nonexpendable  items  (ERRCD  Nxx)  are  listed  in  an  AS. When  expendable  items  are  listed,  it  is  for  information  purposes  only.  With  the exception of WRM equipment items, Equipment Management Code (EMC) “1” items are excluded from EAID records and AFEMS reporting, unless the item is equal to or greater than $5000.00, or is an exception IAW AFI 23-101. 5.4.2.3.2.  Using  commands  can  substitute  expendable  items  and  quantities  when desired.  Exceptions  include  specialized  tools,  personal  retention  and  survival  items, components  of  bench  set  components,  test  measurement  diagnostics  equipment,  and WRM. 5.4.2.4.  End  Items  for  Standby  Use.  Only  in  unusual  circumstances  will  end  item allowances  be  approved  for  standby  (backup  or  maintenance  attrition)  equipment.  If additional  end  items  are  required,  coordinate  with  MAJCOM  FAM  and  CEMO  for approval. 5.4.2.4.1.  Those  requests,  which  are  in  direct  support  of  weapon  systems  or  other major equipment end item systems, must be validated by the applicable SPM, Product Group Manager (PGM), or Materiel Group Manager (MGM) before sending them to AFMC  Allowance  Manager.  Justification  for  this  type  of  allowance/authorization must provide sufficient detail to define the need. 5.4.2.5.  AS’s  will  not  include  expendable  spare  parts  required  for  the  maintenance, assembly,  or  repair  of  end  items.  In  certain  circumstances,  equipment  items  may  be required as spare parts to be used in the repair of other major equipment end items. The items will be obtained using activity code “P” and the reparable equipment item will be turned in to supply. 5.4.2.6.  The  BOI nonexpendable item. in  AS’s  represents the  maximum  allowable  quantity  of  a 5.4.2.6.1.  The  AS  BOI  is  authorized  by  the  applicable  approval  authority  when substantiated by adequate justification. 5.4.2.6.2.  Allowances  should  be  stated  in  flexible  terms  to  allow  for  variables  in equipment, personnel, and workloads. 5.4.2.6.3.  Organization commanders may exceed the BOI in a non-weapon AS if the item  is  ERRC  code  NF,  BC  9,  and  use  code  B  (base  funded/base  support).  This guidance excludes: 5.4.2.6.3.1.  BC9 items  listed in  AS  009, 016 (Parts C, D, E,  F, G, and  H), 410, 501, 654, and 658. 5.4.2.6.3.2.  Weapon system AS, depot support, controlled items, mobility, WRM, and any allowances requiring approval above wing/base level. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 215 5.4.2.6.4.  The equipment custodian will provide a single AETC Form 120/120A for each  course.  List  items  required  in  stock  number  sequence  and  indicate  maximum authorizations.  The  AETC  Form  120  must  include  a  cover  letter  signed  by  the squadron commander or flight chief. The letter must indicate any items and quantities that  supply  must  order.  The  letter  and  AETC  Form  120/120A  will  be  kept  in  the Equipment  Master  Jacket  file  and  the  Custodian  Jacket  file.  A  new  AETC  Form 120/120A  must  be  provided  whenever  there  is  a  change,  add  or  delete.  New  AETC Forms 120/120A will replace old letters in both jacket files. 5.4.2.7.  AS Support Categories. All AS’s will indicate the end item application grouped into specific support categories according to the intended use of the equipment. 5.4.2.7.1.  Category I,  Miscellaneous  Allowances.  These  are  non-published Allowance  Source  Codes  (ASC),  such  as;  Special  Allowance  041;  Retention Authority 048, etc. 5.4.2.7.2.  Category  II,  Special  Support.  Reflects  equipment  to  support  peculiar operations, missions or functions, including WRM support. AS’s in this category may reflect  both  standard  and  nonstandard  equipment.  The  user  will  review  AS’s  in  this category annually to validate the need to continue the requirement and advise the AM of the results of the review. 5.4.2.7.3.

AS updates. The AFEMS (C001) message board will used to notify all affected users of allowance changes/updates. In certain instances, the AFEMS (C001) will provide an automated base authorization update (DOC ID XSJ) which will permit the updating of the  authorized/in-use  detail  record  without  human  intervention.  Non-AFEMS  users  will receive the changes quarterly through CD-ROM. 5.4.3.  Special Allowances and Miscellaneous Allowances 5.4.3.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  Special  Allowance  and  their  use  with  Equipment Management.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 1 (Reference Table 2.63), Vol 2 (ILS-S) and AFH 23-123 Vol 3 Material Management (AFEMS). Special and Miscellaneous Allowances were established  to  permit  necessary  deviations  for  authorizations  when  a  requirement develops for an item or quantity of equipment that normal allowance standard coverage is inappropriate or inadequate. These are non-published Allowance Source Codes (ASC) in AFEMS. 5.4.3.1.1.  Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) Equipment – ASC 040 and ASC 049 5.4.3.1.1.1.  Purpose: Air Force designated RDT&E activities must use ASC 040 and ASC 049 when equipment is used in direct support of RDT&E programs or projects. 5.4.3.1.1.2.  AF  Form  601/TACR  are  not  required.  Authorization  for  ASC  040 and ASC 049 are approved at the base level. 5.4.3.1.1.3.  MAJCOM  may  authorize  certain  RDT&E  activities  to  establish separate ERAA. ERAA will review and make recommendations only on RDT&E requirements that use ASC 040 and 049. 5.4.3.1.1.3.1.  Staff  responsibilities.  ERAA  staff  will  be  technically  qualified to  determine  if  requested  equipment  meets  engineering,  economic,  and mission  requirements.  The  senior  member  of  the  ERAA  will  recommend approval  or  disapproval  in  block  19  of  the  AF  Form  601.  The  staff  member will  send  approved  requests  to  the  LRS/CC  or  Accountable  Officer  and  will return disapproved requests to the submitter. 5.4.3.1.1.3.2.  AFMC  responsibilities.  With  the  advice  of  the  ERAA,  AFMC will  control,  establish  initial  and  replacement  issues,  account  for,  and AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 217 promptly report excess equipment for disposition 5.4.3.1.2.  ASC 041 - Special Allowance 5.4.3.1.2.1.  Special  allowance  AS041  is  applicable  to  equipment  authorizations that normal allowance standard coverage is inappropriate or inadequate. 5.4.3.1.2.2.  In  addition  to  applicable  data  specified  in  Allowance  Standard Change  Requests,  cite  the  peculiar  circumstances  that  preclude  inclusion  of  the item in an AS. 5.4.3.1.2.3.  The MAJCOM CEMO is the approval authority for base funded (BC 9)  equipment  items.  This  does  not  apply  to  controllable  items  requiring  higher level approval. 5.4.3.1.2.4.  MAJCOM  approval  allows  a  base  to  procure  a  BC  9  item  while,  at the same time, processing the request for a normal AS add. 5.4.3.1.2.5.  All  special  requests  for  centrally-procured  items  will  be  forwarded through command channels to the Allowance Manager for final approval. 5.4.3.1.2.6.  The provisions above do not apply to USAF medical activities. 5.4.3.1.2.7.  The  ASC(s)  covering  the  above,  and  other  specific  situations,  are identified  in  AFEMS.  Requisition  or  retained  items  that  are  restricted  for authorization,  acquisition,  or  possession  only  need  approval  of  the  controlling agency  prior  to  the  ASC  being  approved  for  use.  Note:  Through  the  AF  Portal, access the AFEMS webpage address is: https://www.afems.wpafb.af.mil. 5.4.3.1.3.  Depot Non-Standard Equipment 5.4.3.1.3.1.  Purpose: Depot activities at OO-ALC, OC-ALC, WR-ALC, and 309 AMARG  are  authorized  to  use  ASC  042  for  non-stock  listed  equipment  that directly  supports  depot  programs  or  projects  which  has  been  determined  to  be  a onetime  buy.  Submit  requests  for  special  allowance  according  to  Sec.  5D.  For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS). 5.4.3.1.3.2.  Unless  the  items  are  REMS,  no  AF  Form  601/TACR  is  required.  Approval for ASC 042 is approved at the base level. 5.4.3.1.3.3.  MAJCOM  may  authorize  certain  Depot  activities  to  establish separate  ERAA.  ERAA  will  review  and  make  recommendations  only  on  Depot requirements that use ASC 042. 5.4.3.1.3.3.1.  Staff  responsibilities.  ERAA  staff  will  be  technically  qualified to  determine  if  requested  equipment  meets  engineering,  economic,  and mission  requirements.  The  senior  member  of  the  ERAA  will  recommend approval  or  disapproval  in  block  19  of  the  AF  Form  601.  The  staff  member will  send  approved  requests  to  the  LRS/CC  or  Accountable  Officer  and  will return disapproved ones to the submitter. 5.4.3.1.3.3.2.  AFMC  responsibilities.  With  the  advice  of  the  ERAA,  AFMC will  control,  establish  initial  and  replacement  issues,  account  for,  and 218 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 promptly report excess equipment for disposition. 5.4.3.1.4.  Gift Items-ASC 044. 5.4.3.1.4.1.  Purpose.  AFI  51-601  identifies  circumstances  under  which  units  or individuals  must  account  for  gifts.  AFMC  will  establish  accountability  for  these gifts by requesting that Records Maintenance assign the gift a local stock number. This  action  will  exclude  the  gift  from  Air  Force  Supply  Management  Activity Group  (SMAG)  management.  The  action  will  also  allow  the  gift  to  be  issued without reimbursement. 5.4.3.1.4.2.  Detail  record  for  the  gift  will  be  loaded  using  ERRCD  NF2,  REX code 4, routing identifier code JBZ, budget code 9 for items with a unit price less than $250,000 or budget code will be Z for items with a unit price of $250,000 or more and ASC 044. 5.4.3.1.4.3.  AFMC  will  establish  an  authorized/in-use  detail  record  for  the  gift, using ASC 044. 5.4.3.1.5.  Collateral Equipment – ASC 047 5.4.3.1.5.1.  Purpose:  When  collateral  equipment  is  required  it  is  listed  in  an allowance standard AND shown in an approved drawing. When the equipment is shown in an approved drawing but is not listed in an allowance standard, AFMC will  use  ASC  047  as  the  AID  on  detail  records.  Miscellaneous  AS  047  is applicable  to  collateral  equipment  (other  than  installed  real  property)  that  is contractor  affixed/installed  and  contributes  to  the  functional  operations  of  a facility  such  as  a  dining  hall,  bakery,  service  club,  etc.  For  policy  specific requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  refer  to  AFH  23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS). 5.4.3.1.6.  Retention Authority – ASC 048. 5.4.3.1.6.1.  Purpose:  To  save  money,  units  may  retain  equipment  that  will  help complete  the  assigned  mission.    The  item  must  be  safe  to  use,  maintainable  and not  designated  for  recall  due  to  personnel  or  maintenance  hazards.  (T-1). Centrally  procured  items  are  no  longer  required  to  meet  MAJCOM  or  other  AF authorized  requirements.  ASC  048  is  also  used  when  an  item  may  be  too expensive  to  repair  or  to  redistribute  to  meet  other  authorized  Air  Force requirements. 5.4.3.1.6.2.  The unit commander is the approval authority for ASC 048 retention of base-funded items  regardless of previous allowance ID or use code. Specially excluded from this are items in weapon system allowance standards. 5.4.3.1.6.3.  AFMC  may  authorize  a  custodian  to  retain  an  item  rather  than redistribute  it  provided  it  is  not  a  vehicle  or  an  asset/organization  that  would normally  require  higher  than  base-level  approval  for  retention.  AFMC  may approve  ASC  048  when  the  item  is  in-use  or  it  can  be  issued  from  stock/DLA Disposition Services. AFMC screens other organization requirements for  a valid allowance  standard.  When  a  shortage  exists,  offer  the  item  to  the  organization with the valid allowance standard prior to ASC 048. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 219 5.4.3.1.6.3.1.  Under  no  circumstances  will  AFMC  authorize  retention  of  an item that was initially requisitioned. 5.4.3.1.6.4.  Custodians will submit requests or input an allowance change request (TACR) online into the AFEMS (C001) for retention authority when higher than base-level approval is required. 5.4.3.1.6.5.  MAJCOM  CEMOs  may  approve  retention  requests  for  Disposal (DSP) coded items without referring them to the AFMC item manager (IM). Non-DSP  coded  items  with  other  valid  AF  requirements.  When  CEMO  approves  a retention request for an AF CP item that is not coded DSP, then CEMO sends the request to AFMC IM for approval. When the AFMC IM disapproves the request, he or she will send shipping instructions to redistribute the item. 5.4.3.1.6.6.  When  repairing  retained  items  they  may  be  repaired  within  base resources if the repairs are economically reasonable and justified. Vehicle repairs will not exceed the maximum repair allowance in TO 00-25-249. 5.4.3.1.6.7.  Retention  equipment  will  not  be  replaced  under  any  circumstances. AFMC will not substitute other items for retained items under any circumstances. 5.4.3.1.7.  Loan of Other Governmental Agency Equipment to the USAF – ASC 050 5.4.3.1.7.1.  Purpose: Special Allowances (ASC 050) were established to account for loaned equipment from other Governmental Agency Equipment to the USAF 5.4.3.1.7.2.  AFMC  will  set  up  authorized/in-use  detail  records  for  EAID  items that  other  governmental  agencies  lend  to  AF  activities,  using  FED  inputs  with Accounting  and  Finance  interface  code  LOAN  to  establish  the  detail  records. ASC 050 will be used for lent equipment with the first position of the allowance ID suffix aligned with AFH23-123V1 Table 2.63. to identify the lending agency. The  next  three-positions  alpha  code  in  the  allowance  ID  suffix  (last  three positions),  to  further  identify  the  lenders  when  directed  by  the  CEMO  or  higher authorities. If this code is not required, fill the ASC field with three alpha O's. 5.4.3.1.7.3.  AFMC will set up loan controls to be sure that lent items are returned to  the  lending  agency  when  the  loan  is  up,  rather  than  being  turned  in  as  local excess  or  transferred  to  DLA  Disposition  Services.  FED  and  FME  are  the  only authorized inputs for establishing and deleting authorized/in-use detail records for these items. Do not use normal REC, FCI, ISU, SHP, TRM, etc., inputs. 5.4.3.1.8.  Loan of AF Equipment to NON-AF Activities – ASC 051 5.4.3.1.8.1.  Purpose:  Special  Allowances  (ASC  051)  were  established  for activities with which the base does and does not have a host/tenant agreement. 5.4.3.1.8.2.  Activities with which the base does not have an agreement. When in-stock  equipment  is  loaned  to  non-AF  supported  activities  that  a  base  has  no host/tenant agreement with, AFMC will use the temporary loan procedures. 5.4.3.1.8.3.  Activities  with  which  the  base  has  an  agreement.  When  in-stock equipment  is  lent  to  non-AF  supported  activities  that  a  base  has  a  host/tenant agreement  with,  AFMC  will  use  FCI,  ISU,  TIN  procedures  and  ASC  051  to 220 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 process the loan. ASC 050 will be used for lent equipment with the first position of the allowance ID suffix aligned with AFH23-123V1 Table 2.63, to identify the barrowing agency. 5.4.3.1.8.4.  All centrally managed support equipment provided to a contractor as a result of a Base Operations Services contract will be reported on EAID records. 5.4.3.1.8.4.1.  The appropriate AS will be cited. 5.4.3.1.8.4.2.  Requisitions on back order for a contractor will be immediately cancelled if the ACO approves a direct buy by the contractor 5.4.3.1.8.4.3.  CEMOs  will  forecast  future  equipment  requirements  for  these accounts using normal forecast procedures. 5.4.3.1.9.  Miscellaneous  AS  043  is  applicable  to  Air  Force  funded  equipment provided  in  support  of  Department  of  Defense  dependent  schools  and  requires authorized/in-use detail records. 5.4.3.1.10.  Special Projects – ASC 054. 5.4.3.1.10.1.  Purpose:  Equipment  Sources  for  Special  Projects.  Headquarters USAF  or  MAJCOM  may  authorize  a  one-time  special  project  (other  than  a RDT&E project). When no allowance standard exists, then the command assigned to  the  project  will  use  its  authorized  equipment  to  support  the  project  to  the maximum  extent  possible.  Equipment  will  also  be  provided  according  to directives and instructions for the specific project. 5.4.3.1.10.2.  AFMC  will  maintain  authorized/in-use  detail  records  for  special project  equipment,  using  ASC  054.  Identify  the  specific  project  in  the  last  three positions of the allowance ID. 5.4.3.1.10.3.  A  MAJCOM  initiating  a  special  project  will  request  equipment  on TACR citing ASC 054. It will input a TACR online into the AFEMS (C001) for special projects  for  approval  by the allowance manager. The allowance  manager will  then  evaluate  the  requirement  and  check  with  the  appropriate  SM,  IM,  and technical  services  personnel.  For  a  special  project  directed  by  HQ  USAF,  the MAJCOM  assigned  to  the  project  may  approve  required  equipment  unless  the project directive lists other instructions. 5.4.3.1.10.3.1.  AS 054 approval by HQ AFMC is required for: 5.4.3.1.10.3.1.1.  Requested  equipment  item  costs  more  than  $50,000  per unit. 5.4.3.1.10.3.1.2.  Or when HQ AFMC controls the item. 5.4.3.1.10.3.1.3.  Or  when  HQ  USAF  controls  the  item.  Exception  for special  projects  directed  by  HQ  USAF  may  be  approved  by  MAJCOM unless project directive lists other instructions. 5.4.3.1.10.4.  Turn-In.  LRS  EAE  will  turn  in  equipment  authorized  for  special projects as soon as the equipment is no longer needed for the project. 5.4.3.1.11.  Service Test of Commercial Items – ASC 056. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 221 5.4.3.1.11.1.  Purpose: When authorized, customers may purchase or borrow off-the-shelf,  non-aeronautical,  commercial  items  for  service  tests.  These  tests  will determine if the item  meets  a military operational  requirement.  Items authorized for service testing will be tagged as service test equipment. 5.4.3.1.11.2.  The  MAJCOM  CEMO  is  the  approval  authority.  A  TACR  is required  with  complete  justification  for  the  item,  description  of  the  item  to  be tested, price, available source, estimated duration of the testing, additional costs, if any, including transportation. 5.4.3.1.11.2.1.  When  the  AF  has  acquired  title  to  an  item,  use  ASC  056. Process ASC 056 items using normal REC, FCI, ISU, etc., inputs. 5.4.3.1.11.2.2.  When the item is on loan from private industry, use ASC 057. Do not use normal REC, FCI, ISU, etc., inputs. 5.4.3.1.11.3.  AFMC will maintain authorized/in-use detail records for service test equipment.  When  receive  ASC  057  items,  use  FED  inputs  with  A&F  interface code  LOAN  to  establish  detail  records.  Establish  local  controls  for  all  ASC  057 items to make sure that items are returned to the loaning agency and not turned in as local excess or transferred to DLA Disposition Services. When the loan ends, use  FME  inputs  to  delete  the  detail  records  and  return  the  items  to  the  owning agency. 5.4.3.1.11.4.  When the service test determines that the item meets the operational requirement, the customer will submit a request for standardization and cataloging to EME. The request will include a report of the service test along with evidence to  support  standardization  and  cataloging.  EME  will  send  the  request  with attached report to the CEMO. When the service test determines that the item does not  meet  the  operational  requirement,  then  the  customer  will  submit  a  report  of the service test to the IM. 5.4.3.1.12.  Mechanized Materiel Handling Systems (MMHS) - ASC 060. 5.4.3.1.12.1.  Miscellaneous  allowance  060  is  applicable  for  accountability  of MMHS equipment as described in AFI 23-101 Section 7B. 5.4.3.1.12.1.1.  MMHS  project  officer  and  the  organization’s  equipment custodian  will  inform  the  Customer  Support  Section  (LGRMC)  what components make up the MMHS (Do not  include components accounted for as  real  property).  The  list  will  include  the  unit  price  of  each  component. LGRMC will assign an L stock number to the MMHS with a unit price based on the computed total of each component unit price. 5.4.3.1.12.1.2.  AFMC  will  maintain  authorized/in-use  detail  records  for MMHSs using ASC 060. 5.4.3.1.13.  Loan  of  In-Use  Equipment  Between  AF  Organizations  –  ASC  063  and ASC 064 5.4.3.1.13.1.  Purpose:  MAJCOMs may direct the temporary loan of in-use items to  other  Air  Force  units  at  different  bases  in  the  same  or  different  commands. When commands use these equipment loan procedures, EAID accountability and 222 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 reporting  are  transferred  to  the  borrowing  base.  Therefore,  both  the  lending  and the  borrowing  commands  should  appoint  project  managers  to  coordinate  the above procedures with AFMC especially since the lent equipment is often critical to support the mission. When the loan is terminated, the project managers should make sure that AFMC returns the lent equipment, and reestablishes accountability at  the  lending  base.  The  project  manager  should  make  sure  that  this  property accountability  is  transferred  as  quickly  as  possible,  to  reduce  the  in  transit  time (the  period  when  accountability  is  not  established  at  either  the  loaning  or  the borrowing base) to an absolute minimum. 5.4.3.1.13.2.  The MAJCOM CEMO is the approval authority for Loan of In-Use Equipment between AF Organizations. 5.4.3.1.13.2.1.  EAE  or  AFMC  maintains  AF  Form  601  or  TACR  and  all supporting documentation for temporary loan (ASC 064 for the Gaining Unit). 5.4.3.1.13.3.  The  lending  command  will  direct  the  lending  base  to  establish  an authorized/in-use  detail  record  using  ASC  063,  Allowance  ID  suffix  (the SRAN of  the  borrowing  base  OR  the  Julian  date  for  the  termination  of  the  loan)  the number of assets loaned as the authorized quantity, zero as the on-hand quantity, and the shop code. The MAJCOM will decide which Allowance ID suffix to use. The  lending  command  will  direct  the  lending  base  to  ship  the  items  to  the borrowing base. 5.4.3.1.13.3.1.  The lending or borrowing commands may set up specific shop codes  that  lending  or  borrowing  bases  can  use  to  account  for  loaned equipment. 5.4.3.1.13.4.  The borrowing command  will direct  the borrowing base to process an FCI to establish an authorized/in-use detail record using ASC 064, Allowance ID suffix (the SRAN of the lending base or the Julian date of loan termination), zero  as  the  authorized  quantity,  the  number  of  items  on  loan  as  the  on-hand quantity. 5.4.3.1.13.5.  When the loaned equipment is received, AFMC will use the manual FED  procedures  to  process  the  equipment.  Use  the  shipping  document  number from  the  1ET  processed  by  the  lending  base  and  the  Accounting  and  Finance interface  code  EAID  to  properly  account  for  the  receipt  of  the  lent  equipment. However, the review listings do not need to be processed. 5.4.3.1.13.5.1.  When the borrowing base returns the equipment to the lending base, AFMC will use 1ET to ship the equipment and FED to reestablish EAID accountability. 5.4.3.1.13.6.  When  the  MAJCOM  CEMO  directs  the  permanent  retention  of loaned equipment, the loaning base’s will delete the EAID detail citing ASC 063, and  the  borrowing  base’s  change  the  EAID  detail  citing  ASC  064  to  the appropriate AS. 5.4.3.1.14.  Special Equipment Management - ASC 081, 082, and 083 5.4.3.1.14.1.  Purpose:  ASCs  081,  082,  and  083  are  reserved  for  special AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 223 equipment  management  purpose  and  may  only  be  used  when  directed  by AF/A4LR.  These  ASCs  will  only  be  used  when  a  need  exists  to  account  for equipment  which  has  been  returned  from  a  theater  of  operation,  deployment,  or other significant operation. The approval period is not to be indefinite and is to be sufficient to resolve the problems necessitating use of these ASCs. 5.4.3.1.14.2.  Accounting  for  In-use  Equipment  by  SVMWR  activities  that  lost APF  Support.  Revenue  generating  activities  and  the  outdoor  recreation  activity may  retain  in-use  assets  originally  provided  by  APF  support  which  now  exceed allowance standard BOI, as a result of BOI deletion or downward adjustment due to  partial  or  total  APF  support  withdrawal.  These  assets  will  be  transferred  to ASC 083. 5.4.3.1.14.2.1.  ASC  083  assets  will  be  maintained  with  NAF,  will  not  be redistributed  to  satisfy  non-SVMWR  activity  requirements,  will  be  used  to satisfy  same  base  SVMWR  requirements,  and  assets  no  longer  needed  or uneconomical  to  repair  will  be  turned  in  to  the  LRS/CC  or  Accountable Officer. 5.4.3.1.15.  Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) Items - ASC 986 5.4.3.1.15.1.  Purpose:  QRC  items  are  items  listed  in  allowance  standards  which can support QRC (however, some items are not listed in the allowance standards). 5.4.3.1.15.2.  AFMC will maintain authorized/in-use detail records for QRC items using  equipment  code  Q.  For  supporting  QRC  items  listed  in  the  allowance standard,  use  the  allowance  identification  of  the  allowance  standard.  For  QRC items  not  listed  in  the  allowance  standards,  use  ASC  986  unless  the  MAJCOM directs that separate records be established. 5.4.3.1.16.  Loan of Items Required for a Short Time – ASC 987. 5.4.3.1.16.1.  Purpose:  At  times,  a  customer  may  need  an  item  for  a  short  time. AFMC  may  issue  a  temporarily  required  item  without  reimbursement  for  a maximum period of 6 months or less. Approved items are issued with ASC 987, to record that the item has been lent to the customer for a short time. The Julian calendar date of the loan's termination follows ASC 987. 5.4.3.1.16.2.  AFMC will not lend equipment to supplement normal authorizations nor  to  help  the  customer  avoid  normal  operating  expenses.  AFMC  will  only approve  loans  for  short-term  activities  or  activities  with  specific  temporary requirements,  such  as  activities  on  maneuvers  and  training  exercises,  reserve forces field activities, scouting jamborees. 5.4.3.1.16.3.  AFMC  will  normally  lend  equipment  for  90  days;  however,  the LRS/CC  or  Accountable  Officer  may  extend  the  loan  for  an  additional  90  days. AFMC will not extend loans past the 180-day maximum. 5.4.3.1.16.4.  Sponsors for non-SMAG customers. AFMC will not lend equipment to  a borrowing  activity that  is  not  an authorized  SMAG customer, unless a base activity that is an authorized SMAG customer sponsors the loan. The sponsoring activity's  organization  code  will  appear  on  all  records  for  these  items,  and  the 224 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 sponsoring activity will pay any operating expense. 5.4.3.1.16.5.  AFMC will not requisition SMAG equipment to make a temporary loan. Also, if an item is on temporary loan, and a customer needs the item to meet a valid authorization, then AFMC will terminate the loan authorization and issue the item to the customer. 5.4.4.  Emergency Contingency Allowances – ASC 058. 5.4.4.1.  Purpose:  Emergency  Contingency  Allowances  are  applicable  in  instances  of emergency  contingency,  combat  operations,  or  emergency  relief  mission  where  an established  base  cannot  provide  support  and  normal  allowance  coverage  is  inadequate. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS). 5.4.4.2.  The  MAJCOM  Commander  having  logistical  support  responsibility  requests establishment of an FX account  IAW AFI 24-230, Maintaining Air Force DoD Activity Address Codes (DODAAC), and authorizes the use of emergency contingency (allowance identity  ASC  058)  to  authorize  and  identify  requirements.  Advise  AFMC  Allowance Manager  each  time  the  contingency  allowance  procedure  is  authorized  and  the anticipated  scope  and  level  of  approval  within  the  MAJCOM.  Except  for  combat operations,  use  ASC  058  only  in  those  instances  where  the  referenced  FX  account  is established.  To  support  combat  operations,  cite  ASC  058  for  emergency  equipment authorizations  as  a  place  holder  for  equipment  that  is  transferred.  Authorizations  are driven by what is reflected in the LOGDET based on the UTC in the standard AS to meet the  MISCAP.  Send  requests  for  ASC  058  authorizations  for  combat  operations  to  the parent MAJCOM for approval. The MAJCOM periodically evaluates ASC 058 approved authorizations and initiates requests changes to applicable AS, when appropriate. 5.4.4.3.  Upon  completing  the  contingency  requirement,  request  disposition  instructions from the applicable IM. 5.4.5.  Mobility Equipment (ME) and WRM Allowances. 5.4.5.1.  Purpose:  Mobility Equipment (ME) and  WRM Allowances provide a means to allow equipment for the prescribed purposes of ME and WRM support. Determination of items  and  quantities  of  equipment  to  be  authorized  as  ME  will  be  made  by  the coordination  with  (FAM)  and  pilot  unit  based  on  applicable  allowance  documents  and also  the  consideration  of  equipment  which  is  to  be  prepositioned  as  WRM  and/or available  as  joint-use  at  the  deployment  base.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS). 5.4.5.1.1.  During  the  development  stages  of  new  Weapon  Systems  AS’s  (WSAS), items  required  to  support  the  weapon  system  during  mobility  contingencies  are identified  and  included  in  the  WSAS.  The  FAM  will  identify  general-purpose equipment  required  to  support  a  mobility  tasking  and  coordinate  with  CEMO  to incorporate these requirements. 5.4.5.1.2.  Changes  to  WSAS  and  non-WSAS  will  be  coordinated  through  the MAJCOM, which has approval/disapproval authority. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 225 5.4.5.1.3.  Air  Force  policy  dictates  that  active  duty  and  reserve  forces  units  tasked with the same Unit Type Code (UTC) requirements will be similarly equipped so that they  can  be  used  interchangeably.  To  achieve  this  goal,  ME  required  to  meet  the wartime  tasking  of  reserve  forces  must  be  identified  by  the  gaining  MAJCOM  in coordination with ANG, AFRC, and AFMC Allowance Manager. 5.4.5.1.4.  When  adequate  authorization  criteria  is  published  or  has  otherwise  been provided  to  the  AO  by  CEMO  to  permit  base  level  determinations  of  items  and quantities of equipment to be authorized as ME, submission of AF Form 601, etc. for command level approval is not required. 5.4.5.1.5.  All equipment to support a UTC will be on-hand, on-order, or contained in appropriate  budget  documents  if  not  centrally  procured.  AF/A4LR  must  approve exceptions  to  this  policy.  Note:  Home  station  DEPORD-required  ME  that  has  been TEMPORARILY  transferred  to  contingency  location  ASC  058  records  will  be considered as  "on-hand"  assets unless applicable MAJCOMs  direct  permanent  AOR retention. Home station units will not generate replacement requisitions for deployed assets without first verifying MAJCOM approval of permanent AOR retention. 5.4.5.1.6.  WSAS/non-WSAS is the only basis for the authorization and procurement of ME. In no case will equipment items be placed in Unit Type Code logistics detail (LOG-DET) without a WSAS/non-WSAS authorization. 5.4.5.2.  War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Allowances. 5.4.5.2.1.  WRM allowances and authorizations are based on formal wartime tasking in  the  USAF  War  and  Mobilization  Plan  (WMP),  Volume  3,  as  determined  by agreement between AF/A3O and the appropriate MAJCOM operational OPR. 5.4.5.2.2.  Detailed  instructions  regarding  policy,  allowances  and  accounting  for WRM is contained in AFI 23-101, Sec. 5D. 5.4.6.  Deployment and Transfer of Equipment. 5.4.6.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  procedures  for  the  transfer  and  deployment  of equipment.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS). 5.4.6.2.  General  Discussion:  Transfer  of  accountability  will  be  the  primary  method  to move equipment. Movement of all equipment in support of contingency, humanitarian, or disaster relief operations will be accomplished using transfer procedures in the ILS-S or AFEMS. Note:  The primary method to move equipment for ANG and AFRC will be to deploy  not  transfer.  Transfer  of  ANG  and  AFRC  equipment  can  only  occur  when  the ANG/AFRC CEMOs have determined that it is  excess  to  their needs. Excess  ANG  and AFRC  equipment  will  follow  transfer  procedures.  Transfer  of  ANG  and  AFRC equipment that is not excess can only be transferred when DoDI 1225.06, Para. 4e, Encl. 3, Para. 2, Equipping the Reserve Forces; AFI 10-402, Mobilization Planning; and AFH 10-416,  Personnel  Readiness  and  Mobilization  are  complied  with  first.  Additionally,  at least 45 days prior to initiating ANF/AFRC equipment transfers, gaining MAJCOMs will provide  a  replacement  plan  to  AF/A4LR  for  staffing  and  subsequent  approval  with  the SECDEF  through  the  Asst.  SECDEF  for  Reserve  Affairs  (ASD  (RA)).  AF/A4LR  will 226 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 forward  the  approved  plan  and  proposal  for  withdrawal,  diversion,  k  or  reduction  for equipment to the ANG/AFRC CEMO’s. 5.4.6.3.

If the custodian has AFEMS access, assist with the creation of the deployment/transfer package. 5.4.6.3.5.6.2.1.  When  the  transfer  is  from  one  base  account  to  another  on the same base, the transfer will result in  an out-of-balance  condition  at  the losing  account.  This  will  result  in  an  automatic  backfill.  To  rectify  this situation,  prior  to  transfer,  process  a  replacement  issue  with  TEX  “H”  to suppress  automatic  requisition.  Immediately  upon  return  of  asset  from deployment,  cancel  the  replacement  issue  (backorder).  Note:  Transfer vehicles  BEFORE  other  items  on  the  same  custody  account  to  prevent rejects. Use only valid Routing Identifiers (RIDs). Do not use RID “XXX”. The  use  of  RID  “CLS”  (classified)  is  authorized  and  will  be  kept  to  an absolute minimum and only to identify true classified locations. 5.4.6.3.5.6.3.  Ensure  all  listings/accountable  documents  are  signed  and  in possession  of  the  deploying  custodian  prior  to  departure.  Instruct  the custodian to hand-carry listings/documents to the gaining location. 5.4.6.3.5.6.4.  Returns. 5.4.6.3.5.6.4.1.

Prepare the inputs  necessary to remove the 230 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 deployment  indicator,  subtract  the  appropriate  quantities  from  the deployed quantities and add it to the on-hand quantity. Assets deployed using  the  group  selection  option,  should  be  returned  from  deployment using  the  same  selection  criteria.  Note:  Do  not  remove  the  deployed indicator until the deployed quantity is reduced to zero. 5.4.6.3.5.6.4.1.2.  Upon  receipt  of  transferred  assets  at  the  gaining location, use the document number/transaction control number (TCN) to update shipment suspense detail (99s) and obtain accountability. 5.4.6.3.5.6.4.2.  EAE  will  coordinate  with  the  equipment  custodian  to determine  the  status  of  the  deployment  and  rectify  existing  details  when deployed assets have not returned within 15 days of deployment termination date.  (T-2)  Use  LIMS-EV  to  identify  and  update  status  for  assets  15  days overdue.  Note:  AFEMS  only  produces  Overdue  Return  Notices  when  the accountability remains with the host LRS CC/AO. 5.4.6.3.6.  The  Expeditionary  Logistics  Readiness  Squadron  (ELRS)  will  assume responsibility of all equipment and transactions processed against the owning SRAN, to include all equipment and transactions from tenant units and/or satellite accounts.

General  Discussion:  Prior  to  withdrawing  or  requisitioning  equipment  from DLADS,  the  requesting  organization  must  comply  with  procedures  that  outline equipment authorizations and have a valid equipment authorization established. 5.4.11.3.  Preparatory Actions for DLADS Withdrawals: 5.4.11.3.1.  When practicable, the EAE and AFMC shall obtain technical advice and recommendations  from  functional  experts  prior  to  approval/disapproval  of  any equipment authorization request for equipment being withdrawn from DLADS. 5.4.11.3.2.  The  EAE  and  AFMC  can  approve/disapprove  changes  within  an allowance  standard  and  disapprove  changes  that  exceed  the  allowance  standard. Approved  recommended  changes  to  an  allowance  standard  will  be  input  into  the AFEMS  using  the  TACR  and  include  recommendations/evaluators  comments.  The 236 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 TACR  will  be  forwarded  to  the  next  evaluator.  For  supported  tenant  units  of  other commands, the AFEMS will forward the request to the parent command of the tenant unit. 5.4.11.3.3.  Input  into AFEMS all requests to  change allowance standards or special allowance  for  HQ  USAF  controlled  items.  The  AFEMS  will  forward  the  request  to the  parent  MAJCOM  for  approval  and  submission  to  the  appropriate  allowance manager. Note: Submit special weapons allowance change requests to the Prime Item Manager. 5.4.11.4.  DLADS Withdrawal Procedures for Equipment Items. 5.4.11.4.1.  Before  accountable  equipment  items  can  be  withdrawn  from  DLADS,  a valid allowance standard or authorization supporting the equipment  must exist. This authorization requirement also includes unserviceable equipment items which will be repaired by the customer and used for their original purpose. Any vehicle equipment asset withdrawals must be coordinated with the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff IAW AFI 24-302. 5.4.11.4.1.1.  When  an  authorization  is  not  established,  Equipment  Management personnel  process  accountable  items  using  equipment  transfer  (FED)  transaction procedures. 5.4.11.4.1.2.  When an authorization and customer due-out are already established in the ILS-S for the item, cancel the existing due-out and reestablish it with TEX H. 5.4.11.4.1.3.  When  equipment  transfer  (FED)  procedures  are  used,  Customer Support  prepares  a  DD  Form  1348-1A  requisition  (A0*)  document  using  an offline requisition document number to withdraw the item from DLADS. Clearly mark  the  requisition  (A0*)  document  “Do  Not  Post”  and  attach  it  to  the  FED document. 5.4.11.4.2.  Non-accountable individual equipment items withdrawn from DLADS to fill  a  valid  authorization  for  individual/organizational  clothing  (ASC  016)  are processed through the retail  materiel  management  Individual Equipment  function, if this function is not contracted out. 5.4.11.4.3.  Unserviceable  equipment  withdrawals.  Equipment  authorizations  are  not required for unserviceable equipment items withdrawn from DLADS which will not be  repaired,  or  used  for  their  original  purpose  by  the  customer.  In  this  case,  the customer provides the LRS/Materiel Management Activity a signed statement by the organizational  commander  or  designated  representative.  This  statement  certifies  the unserviceable  equipment  item  will  not  be  repaired  or  used  for  its  original  purpose. Customer  Support  personnel  review  the  signed  statement  to  ensure  necessary approval is obtained prior to processing the withdrawal. The customer should retain a copy of the approval as authority to retain the unserviceable equipment item without accountability.  The  statement  may  be  submitted  by  letter  or  typed  on  the  DD  Form 1348-1A requisition (A0*) document by Customer Support and will read as follows, “I certify this item will not be repaired, is not to fill a valid authorization, and will not be used for its original, intended purpose.” AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 237 5.4.11.4.4.  Re-identification  of  equipment  items.  Equipment  items  obtained  for purposes  other  than  what  they  were  intended  must  be  re-identified  for  the LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity.  A  local  L-serialized  stock  number  will  be assigned  with  the  original  stock  number  loaded  in  the  nomenclature  field. Additionally, these items will be assigned an ERRCD NF1 to these items and the unit price  of  one  penny  (.01)  will  be  loaded.  For  example,  a  withdrawal  of  condemned flight suits to perform paint details. 5.4.12.  Allowance Source Code (ASC) Listing. 5.4.12.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  procedural  process  for  review  and  validation  of allowance source codes. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS). 5.4.12.2.  General Discussion: AFMC will use the ASC listing to ensure that equipment authorizations  are  within  required  allowance  standards,  units  are  requesting  minimum quantities of equipment and the Allowance Source Code (ASC) applies to the requestor. 5.4.12.3.  Perform the following actions: 5.4.12.3.1.  Review  all  ASCs  at  least  annually  and  annotate  the  ASC  Listing  with changes/actions. During ASC reviews, as a minimum, examine the following: 5.4.12.3.1.1.  Special  allowances.  Examples  of  special  allowances  include  048, 054, and 063. AFMC will ensure approved AFEMS TACR is on file. Note: ASC 048 is not authorized for NWRM equipment. 5.4.12.3.1.2.  Duplication  of  requirements.  Research  using  organization  citing same NSN, allowance standard (AS), part, section, subsection and column against multiple equipment records and validate total authorized quantity against the basis of issue. 5.4.12.3.1.2.1.  Review  UTCVAR  report  of  ASC  being  reviewed  and  clear variances. Variances are delinquent if not cleared within 15 calendar days of report date. 5.4.12.3.1.2.2.  ASC  listing  with  attached  UTCVAR  report  will  be  kept  on file, either electronically or in hard copy until next review. 5.4.12.3.2.  Multiple  components  and  interchangeable  substitute  (ISG)  relationships. Verify that bench mock-ups and other multiple and component ISG relationships are authorized within the allowance standard or technical order. 5.4.12.3.2.1.  Compare  mobility  (A), base use  (B), joint  use (C) and  war reserve material  (D)  use  codes  on  Equipment  Authorization  Inventory  Data/Document (EAID) records against authorizations in AFEMS. 5.4.12.3.2.2.  Verify  unsuitable  and/or  unsatisfactory  substitutes  with  D043 relationships and/or AFEMS basis of issue narrative. 5.4.13.  Equipment Authorization and On Hand Balance Reconciliation. 5.4.13.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  procedural  process  for  review  and  correction  of equipment  out  of  balance  conditions,  quantity  errors,  and  Allowance  Source  Code  000 238 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 excess  equipment.

Accounts will not be frozen prior to 60 calendar days of initial LRS EAE and unit Equipment Custodian excess notification. 5.4.13.3.1.5.  LRS/Materiel Management Activity will not refuse returns of excess equipment  due  to  lack  of  disposition  instructions.  Property  will  be  returned  and stored by LRS while awaiting disposition. (T-1) 5.4.13.3.1.6.  Excess ASC 000 and due-outs exist. Take action to return the item for subsequent automatic due-out release to satisfy any existing due-out. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6 for return (TIN) processing. 5.4.13.3.1.7.  When  there  are  no  existing  requirements  for  the  excess  equipment and  it  is  still  required,  then  submit  AF  Form  601  justifying  the  need  for  the equipment. 5.4.13.3.2.  Quantity errors. Take the following actions based on the condition for the error: 5.4.13.3.2.1.  When the quantity in-use is less than the quantity authorized or the quantity  in-use  plus  due-outs  are  less  than  the  quantity  authorized,  then  take action to reduce the authorization or establish a due-out. 5.4.13.3.2.2.  When  the  quantity  in-use  exceeds  the  authorized  quantity,  take action to increase the authorization or transfer excess quantity to ASC 000. 5.4.13.3.2.3.  When  the  quantity  in-use  plus  due-out  exceeds  the  quantity AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 239 authorized, increase the authorization or cancel the excess due-out, unless the due out  is  a  replacement  backorder  reflected  by  demand  code  R.  (The  customer  is retaining the old item until the replacement is received). 5.4.13.3.2.4.  When the quantity authorized and the quantity in-use is unequal for items citing ASC 048 or 000A, then correct the authorizations to reflect the same quantity as the in-use quantity. When a due-out exists, validate the authorized and in-use  quantities  and  if  an  asset  is  available  and  not  required  then  transfer  the asset  to  the  requiring  custodian  IAW  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5,  Inter-custody SPRAM Receipt Transfer Input (FET). 5.4.13.3.2.5.  When  the  quantity  authorized  and  in-use  citing  ASC  048  or  000A are  equal  and  a  due-out  exists,  then  either  cancel  the  due-out  or  increase  the authorization. 5.4.13.3.2.6.  When the quantity authorized and in-use equal zero and there isn’t a due-out, then delete the detail. 5.4.13.3.3.  Duplicate document number. When two or more prime records are loaded then delete one of the duplicate prime authorized/in-use detail records. 5.4.13.3.4.  No authorized detail loaded for this document number. Process an inquiry to  determine if a prime  authorized in/use detail  record is  loaded and  either establish an  authorized/in-use  detail  record  or  transfer  the  item  to  another  authorized/in-use detail record. 5.4.13.3.5.  Equipment on loan has reached expiration date and a due-out exists. Take action to update the expiration date or transfer the item to satisfy the due-out. 5.4.13.3.6.

A satellite Equipment Management is usually  established  to  manage  satellite  equipment;  however,  a  single  custodian  may be used if there are not enough management actions to justify a separate function. Be aware that the single  custodian concept  cannot  be used without AF/A4LR  approval.  In  addition,  if  the  single  custodian  concept  is  being  used  when  an  activity  is  given satellite  status,  AF/A4LR  must  give  approval  before  conversion  to  a  separate Equipment  Management.  Note:  MAJCOM  or  theatre  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity’s will also concur on the use of these procedures. 5.4.15.3.4.1.  Change  of  custodian.  Follow  the  procedures  for  Signing  Custody Receipts  for  a  change  in  Property  Custodians.  Exceptions  to  this  must  comply with this chapter. 5.4.15.3.4.2.  Maintain an inventory schedule which ensures 100 % of the account is  inventoried  over  a  twelve  month  period.  Note:  MAJCOM  or  theatre LRS/Materiel Management Activity must approve extensions to this frequency. 5.4.15.3.4.3.  Deployments.  Transfer  assets  deployed  from  the  prepositioned satellite supply operation to a deployable CA/CRL. 5.4.15.3.4.3.1.  Attain  signature  on  deployed  CA/CRL  from  the  receiving custodian. 5.4.15.3.4.3.2.  Perform a 100 % inventory of the deployed CA/CRL prior to transferring the assets back to the satellite supply operational account. 5.4.16.  Relief  from  Responsibility  for  Public  Property  Lost,  Damaged  or  Destroyed  by Causes Other Than Fair Wear and Tear. 5.4.16.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  procedures  to  relieve  individual  liability  for  public property  lost,  damaged  or  destroyed  due  to  custodian  negligence  and  during  Disaster Relief  or  Combat  Conditions.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS). 242 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.4.16.2.

Contact the AFMC SA/LW Function SA equipment specialist. 5.4.24.3.15.  Captured SA/LW. 5.4.24.3.15.1.  Special procedures for captured SA/LW. 5.4.24.3.15.2.  Caution:  Personnel  involved  with  managing  SA  must  be  familiar with AFI 31-101 before using information in this section. 5.4.24.3.15.3.  Special procedures apply for accountability of captured SA/LW. 5.4.24.3.15.3.1.  All AF SA/LW that are currently on hand but not registered in the applicable LRS/materiel management system and all those captured in the future are subject to the following guidance: 5.4.24.3.15.3.1.1.  Ensure all SA/LW are safeguarded IAW AFI 31-101. 5.4.24.3.15.3.1.2.  Immediately enter information on captured weapons into the  applicable  materiel  management  system  using  stock  number “1005PCAPTURE.”  The  model  number  should  be  added  to  the  end  of  the stock  number (e.g.,  1005PCAPTUREM9, 1005PCAPTUREAK47), utilizing no more than four characters. the  weapon to identify 5.4.24.3.15.3.1.3.  Identify in writing, to their parent MAJCOM, the type of SA/LW  complete  with  description,  quantity,  serial  number,  and  intended purpose. 5.4.24.3.15.3.1.4.  MAJCOMs  will  provide  disposition  instructions.  In  the meantime,  bases  must  retain  these  assets  using  ASC  054CAPT.  (T-2).  Disposition will consist of 1 of 3 different scenarios: 5.4.24.3.15.3.1.5.  When  the  SA/LW/small  arm  is  intended  for  display purposes, it must be approved  IAW AFI 84-103, USAF Heritage Program, Chapter 11. 5.4.24.3.15.3.1.6.  If assets could be used to support mission requirements if approved by MAJCOM. 5.4.24.3.15.3.1.7.  When  captured disposal/demilitarization. the  most  probable fate  will  be 5.4.24.3.15.3.1.8.  When  not  approved  for  display  or  to  fill  mission requirements,  units  and  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  must  ensure that  disposal  of  captured  SA  be  IAW  DoD  4160.21-M,  "Defense  Materiel Disposition Manual, Ch 4. that  survives  DLADS  screening  will  be 5.4.24.3.15.3.1.9.  SA/LW destroyed. When the local DLADS has expanded demilitarization authority and  there  are  less  than  10  SA/LW,  the  DLADS  will  generally  accomplish 264 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 the  demilitarization.  Otherwise  the  DLADS  will  give  instructions  for shipping  the  SA/LW  to  a  demilitarization  facility.  When  the  MAJCOM authorizes shipment  of the SA/LW to  another location for demilitarization, the  losing  unit  will  input  the  shipping  transaction  while  the  gaining  unit input  the  proper  demilitarization  instructions  into  applicable  materiel management system. Note: If the shipment is to the Anniston Army Depot, funding will be required to have the SA/LWs demilitarized. 5.4.24.3.15.3.1.10.  ASC  054CAPT  will  be  used  for  captured  SA/LW awaiting disposition from MAJCOM. 5.4.24.3.15.3.1.11.  File  Maintenance.  All  SA/LW  controlled  by  serial number  must  be  assigned  a  valid  NSN  or  service  stock  number  (NC/ND). Records  Maintenance  must  submit  AF  Form  86,  when  required.  General Officer Personal  Defense Weapons (GO PDW). For  additional information concerning 5.4.24.3.16.  Special Issue of Small Arms. 5.4.24.3.16.1.  Small  Arms  to  General  Officers.  Air  Force  general  officers (including  Air  Force  Reserve  (AFRC)  and  federally  recognized  Air  National Guard general officers) may be issued a unique configuration of their standard Air Force handgun on a semi-permanent basis when they submit a letter of request to AF/DPG  (AF/REG  for  AFR  GOs)  for  verification.  This  letter  of  request  must contain  an  appropriate  organizational  mailing  address  and  a  Stock  Record Account Number (SRAN) the weapon will be shipped to. These unique handguns are  referred  to  as  the  GO  PDW  program,  refer  to  the  current  version  of  the General Officer Handbook. 5.4.24.3.16.2.  The  USAF  Small  Arms  Program  Office  located  at  Robins  AFB, GA  is  responsible  for  maintaining  control  of  the  issue  and  turn-in  of  these  GO PDWs. 5.4.24.3.16.3.  No  Logistics  Readiness  Squadron  (LRS)/supply  activity  action  is required  when  a  GO  PDW  is  shipped  to  a  base  from  the  USAF  Small  Arms Program Office marked for a general officer since these weapons do not fall under the Military Standard Requisition and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP). Shipments of  GO  PDWs  are  accomplished  using  an  AF  Form  1149  (Requisition  and Invoice/Shipping Document). 5.4.24.3.16.3.1.  The  GO  PDW  is  the  only  weapon  in  the  AF  inventory  that can  be  shipped  “off-line”  via  an  AF  Form  1149  without  a  waiver.  Initial shipments  of  the  GO  PDWs  go  directly  to  the  general  or  his/her  aide  who signs  for  receipt  of  the  weapon  on  the  DD  Form  1149  from  the LRS/transportation  activity  personnel.  The  General  Officer  or  his/her  aide must  make  a  copy  of  the  signed  AF  Form  1149  and  send  it  to  the  SAPO  at Robins  AFB,  GA.  The  LRS/supply  activity  does  not  process  REC/DOR transactions and does not establish EAID accountability. 5.4.24.3.16.4.  Retained  Handguns.  General  officers  may  retain  the  GO  PDW issued  to  them  until  retirement.  Upon  retirement,  the  general  officer  may  either AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 265 turn-in  or  purchase  the  weapon.  If  the  weapon  is  to  be  turned  in,  it  must  be returned  to  the  LRS  Commander/Chief  of  Supply  at  the  general  officer's  duty station.  The  LRS  Commander/Chief  of  Supply  is  responsible  for  requesting disposition  instructions  from  the  USAF  Small  Arms  Program  Office.  If  the weapon  is  to  be  purchased,  payment  is  based  on  the  current  catalog  price.  To obtain  or  verify  the  stock  number,  serial  numbers,  and  price  of  the  GO  PDW, contact  the  USAF  Small  Arms  Program  Officer  at  Robins  AFB,  Georgia.  For detailed instructions on how to  process  the purchase request, refer to  the current General Office Handbook. 5.4.25.  Forecasting New Equipment Requirements. 5.4.25.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  procedures  to  forecast  new  equipment  requirements. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS). 5.4.25.2.  Forecasting is necessary to support future organizations changes, future fielding of  new  or  modified  weapon/support  systems,  Special  Training  Equipment  Program (STEP) requirements, WRM changes, and ME changes. 5.4.25.3.  The MAJCOM/FOA/DRU CEMO will perform the following: 5.4.25.3.1.  Ensure  the  accurate  and  timely  forecasting  of  future  requirements  are noted in the classified equipment requirements computation system. 5.4.25.3.2.  Ensure  forecast  authorization  equipment  data  only  contains  those  items indicated  as  nonexpendable  by  assignment  of  expendability,  recoverability, reparability  category  (ERRC)  code  of  “S”  or  “U”  in  the  applicable  weapon/support system ASs. Note: Do not include expendable items, including those contained in the AS, in the forecasts submitted by the owning MAJCOM. 5.4.25.3.3.  Submit  forecast  data  as  soon  as  possible  after  requirements  are  known (corresponding  Organization  Information  Data  is  also  necessary).  Note:  It  must  be stressed  that  forecasting  affects  only  authorizations.  It  does  not  affect  actual movement  of  assets,  but  causes  reallocation  of  existing  assets  within  the  equipment item requirements computation affecting the AFMC budget/buy requirement position. The actual redistribution of SE assets, caused by movement of a system or subsystem, is subject to negotiations between the MAJCOMs, the SPM, and the IM. 5.4.25.3.4.  The  owning  MAJCOM  CEMO for  developing, maintaining,  and  reporting  forecast  authorization  equipment  data,  as  required,  to project  equipment  requirements  in  support  of  programmed  and  unprogrammed  unit actions. Note: Failure to submit accurate forecasts in a timely manner will negatively impact  the  ability  of  the  AFMC  Air  Logistics  Complexes  to  support  the  projected change. responsible is 5.4.25.3.5.  The owning MAJCOM will develop forecasts for base funded items and furnish them to the bases to ensure their budget projections are accurately projected. Reporting forecasts for base funded assets to AFMC is not required. 5.4.25.3.6.  The owning MAJCOM will notify the host MAJCOM when a unit is to be activated,  inactivated,  moved,  or  when  a  mission  change  will  occur  within  host 266 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 MAJCOM area of control. Additionally, the owning MAJCOM will provide the host MAJCOM with all applicable unit forecast authorization equipment data, for centrally procured (CP) and base funded items. 5.4.25.3.7.  The applicable CEMO will actively participate with the SPO and SPM in the  mock-up  inspections,  development  of  engineering  inspections,  contractor technical  compliance  inspections,  weapon  system  phasing  group  meetings,  SE reviews,  provisioning  conferences  and  other  related  meetings  pertinent  to  the weapon/support system program. 5.4.25.3.8.  When  forecasts  are  developed  for  programmed  changes,  the  owning MAJCOM  CEMO  must  ensure  that  ILS-S  authorization  records  are  not  established prior  to  the  actions  identified  in  the  following  paragraphs.  When  both  records (Current  Authorizations/Forecast  Authorizations)  are  established,  the  Air  Force budget  requirement  is  overstated.  Additional  information  regarding  forecasting authorizations  for  organization  equipment,  development  of  forecast  authorization records, and forecasting for Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories (PMEL) support equipment (SE) is contained in the following paragraphs. 5.4.25.4.  Authorizations for Organization Equipment. 5.4.25.4.1.  Equipment  subject nonexpendable items of equipment required for the support of AF organizations. to  EAID/Forecast  authorization includes  all 5.4.25.4.2.  Forecast  authorizations  will  be  used  to  systematically  plan,  develop  and report  projected  equipment  requirements  for  centrally  procured  items  to  support future conditions. 5.4.25.4.3.  Forecasts will be submitted for each organization requiring organizational equipment  support programmed in  the USAF Program  Document “Units, Bases and Priorities” (PD) for activation, conversion or reorganization more than 270 days after the next scheduled requirements reporting date. 5.4.25.4.4.  Forecasts  will  be  submitted  when  changes  occur in  equipment authorizations  (increase  or  decrease)  due  to  conditions  not  reflected  in  the  PD  and scheduled  more  than  270  days  after  the  next  scheduled  requirements  PD  reporting date. 5.4.25.4.5.  Exceptions to the normal 270 days are those SE requirements for PMEL (360 days). 5.4.25.5.  Development of Forecast Authorization Records. 5.4.25.5.1.  The  development  and  reporting  of  forecast  authorizations  is  essential  to ensure  adequate  budget/buy  and  timely  supply  support  for  future  equipping requirements. Forecast records only reflect authorizations for requirements to support programmed  or  unprogrammed  unit  actions  and  must  be  maintained  in  a  current status  to  accurately  reflect  future  authorizations  required  to  support  programmed actions. 5.4.25.5.2.  The  owning  MAJCOM  is  responsible  for  preparation,  maintenance,  and processing of forecast authorizations of the affected organization, with assistance (as necessary) from the appropriate AFMC allowance manager and SPM. When forecasts AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 267 involve tenant units supported by a different command, full coordination between the two MAJCOMs and the affected AO is essential. 5.4.25.5.3.  When new weapon or support systems are acquired or if unit strength  is increased or decreased, a forecast or forecast change must be processed. 5.4.25.5.4.  Forecasts are required when USAF PDs show: 5.4.25.5.4.1.  A weapon or support system is scheduled for activation. 5.4.25.5.4.2.  A unit is scheduled for re-designation. 5.4.25.5.4.3.  A  unit  is  scheduled  to  convert  to  a  different  weapon  system  or maintenance concept. 5.4.25.5.4.4.  Changes are scheduled to occur in operational plans, which result in a change in equipment requirements. 5.4.25.5.4.5.  A unit is scheduled for significant changes in personnel capabilities and functions. 5.4.25.5.4.6.  A  unit  is  scheduled  to  transfer  between  commands  more  than  270 days  subsequent  to  the  reporting  date.  The  gaining  command  is  responsible  for submission of the forecast. 5.4.25.5.5.  Forecasts  will  be  submitted  when  non-programmed  (non-USAF  PD) changes  affect  (add,  increase,  delete  or  reduce)  in-being  organizational  EAID authorizations more than 270 days beyond the AFEMS reporting date. 5.4.25.5.6.  Forecasts are required to change requirements to meet: increased  or  decreased  workloads.  For  example: 5.4.25.5.6.1.  Scheduled Additional  tenant  units  to  be  assigned  to  the  base  and  will  be  supported  by  the host base shops. 5.4.25.5.6.2.  Changes  in  the  numbers  or  types  of  systems  to  be  assigned  to  the base and will be supported by base shops. 5.4.25.5.6.3.  Any  other  future  condition  scheduled  to  occur  more  than  270  days after  the  AFEMS  reporting  date,  which  will  increase  or  decrease  equipment requirements of an in-being base organization. 5.4.25.6.  Forecasting for PMEL Support Equipment. 5.4.25.6.1.  The activation, conversion, movement, or transfer of a weapon system or subsystem  at  a  base  may  require  augmentation  of,  or  additional  SE  within  PMEL. Care  must  be  taken  to  ensure  these  requirements  are  correctly  identified  and forecasted as outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 3. 5.4.25.6.1.1.  If  these  requirements  affect  a  unit  supported  under  a  host/tenant agreement  as  in  AFI  25-201,  Support  Agreements  Procedures,  the  MAJCOM  of the  tenant  unit  will  identify  these  requirements  to  the  host  MAJCOM,  to  ensure they are aware of the mission change. 5.4.25.6.2.  SE  requirements  for  PMEL  should  be  submitted  360  days  prior  to  the scheduled  event.  Input  or  retention  of  forecast  records  within  these  designated  time 268 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 frames  would  inflate  the  AFMC  buy/budget  position.  Failure  to  provide  the  item manager  with  forecast  data  pending  establishment  of  in-use  details  will  normally result in nonsupport of the requirements. 5.4.26.  Organization Information Record. 5.4.26.1.  Purpose: Describe procedures for management of the organization information records. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS). 5.4.26.2.  Organization  Information  Records  identify  all  essential  data  and  programmed actions associated with an organization. These actions are associated with additions to or deletions  from  assigned  systems,  activations  of  new  weapon  or  support  systems, transfers,  moves,  redesignations,  or  the  capabilities  of  the  organizations  being  reported. For  example,  when  activating  a  new  organization,  you  must  create  a  new  Organization Identity (Org ID) Number. 5.4.26.3.  See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  3,  Ch  4  for  applicable  ILS-S  processes  to  manage Organization Information Records. 5.4.27.  Base Issue/Distribution/and Redistribution. 5.4.27.1.  Purpose:  Describe  procedures for base issue, distribution and redistribution of equipment.  The  ILS-S  is  designed  to  respond  to  processed  receipt  and  return  actions based on previously established due-in, due-out, and equipment in-use detail records. The ILS-S will automatically accomplish required issue transactions and distribution of assets to authorizations loaded to the EAID record. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  refer  to  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2  (ILS-S)  and  Vol  3 (AFEMS). 5.4.27.1.1.  Upon receipt of equipment, the AO will update established due-in/due-out and  EAID  records  when  an  issue  is  made  to  a  designated  organization.  If  the  need exists to fill a higher priority request, the AO may reassign the item. 5.4.27.1.2.  When  an  organization  reports  excess  equipment  on  hand,  care  will  be taken  to  ensure  that  overages  are  actually  in  excess  to  authorizations,  rather  than belonging to another custody account. The AO will check due-in records to ascertain if a different organization has a shortage and, when possible (if the item is not USAF or  CEMO  controlled),  reissue  to  that  shortage.  If  the  assets  are  ANG  or  AFRC support  equipment,  the  applicable  CEMO  must  be  contacted  by  the  unit  EAE  for possible re-distribution within the reserve component IAW DoDD 5105.77, National Guard Bureau, and/or DoDI 1225.06, Equipping the Reserve Forces. 5.4.27.1.3.  When  turned  in  assets  cannot  be  reallocated  to  an  existing  base organization  the  AO  will  report  the  item  to  the  applicable  IM  and  await  IM disposition  instructions.  Procedures  for  reporting  excess  equipment  are  contained  in Sec. 5D. 5.4.27.2.  Current  AO  EAID  records  are  reported  online  in  the  AFEMS/C001,  and  used for  computation  of  requirements  and  establishing  buy/budget  positions.  IMs  screen output  products  for  obvious  errors  and  reconcile  quantities  prior  to  taking  procurement, disposal, or redistribution actions. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 269 5.4.27.2.1.  Assets  reported  in  excess  of  established  authorizations  and/or  reflecting ASC “000” generate queries from the IM to record validity and availability of excess for redistribution. 5.4.27.2.2.  The  queries  are  forwarded  to  the  reporting  AO,  who  will  verify  the reported excess. Replies to IM queries are required as soon as possible, but not later than ten working days after receipt. 5.4.27.3.  Decentralized  Procurement  Distribution/Redistribution.  The  distribution  and redistribution of assets procured under the decentralized process  will be at  the direction of the MAJCOM that owns, or has funded for, the asset(s). MAJCOMs must coordinate these  actions  with  the  IMs  to  ensure  the  most  urgent  requirements  are  filled,  when possible, and that critical assets are not prematurely disposed. 5.4.28.  Equipment Disposition for Base Deactivation and Closure. 5.4.28.1.  Purpose: Describe procedures for Equipment disposition for Base Deactivation and  Closure.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific guidance refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2 (ILS-S) and Vol 3 (AFEMS). 5.4.28.2.  LRS  or  Materiel  Management  Activities  will  contact  AFMC  and  MAJCOM Equipment  Management  to  coordinate  the  disposition  of  equipment  in  conjunction  with base deactivation and closures. (T-1) 5.4.28.2.1.  Upon  coordination  in  paragraph  above,  LRS/Materiel  Management Activities will assign Allowance Source Code 076 for bases undergoing deactivation. (T-1)  This  code  identifies  excess  related  personal  property  reflected  on  the  AO managed EAID holding account pending transfer to civil engineering and subsequent reporting  to  General  Services  Administration  (GSA)  on  SF  118C,  Related  Personal Property Schedule C - Supplement to Report of Excess Real Property. 5.4.28.2.2.  Assets  will  be  transferred  directly  from  the  active  in-use  custodian account to the AO holding account to preclude stock fund capitalization action. 5.4.28.2.3.  LRS/Materiel Management Activities will consult AFMC and MAJCOM Equipment Management for guidance regarding any further required actions. (T-1) 5.4.29.  Loan of In-Use Equipment between AF Organizations. 5.4.29.1.  Temporary Loan of In-Use Items. MAJCOMs may direct the temporary loan of in-use items to other Air Force units at different bases in the same or different commands, using the following procedures: 5.4.29.1.1.  The  lending  command  will  direct  the  AFMC  of  the  lending  base  to establish an authorized/in-use detail record. This record will include the following: 5.4.29.1.1.1.  ASC 063. 5.4.29.1.1.2.  Allowance ID suffix (the SRAN of the borrowing base). 5.4.29.1.1.3.  The number of assets lent as the authorized quantity. 5.4.29.1.1.4.  Zero as the on-hand quantity. 5.4.29.1.1.5.  The expiration date of the loan will be placed in the increment code 270 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 field. 5.4.29.1.2.  The lending command will direct the lending base to ship the items to the borrowing base. The lending command will also specify the length of the loan. 5.4.29.1.3.  AFMC  will  use  the  appropriate  1ET  transfer  procedures  to  process  the shipment.  The  review  listings  do  not  need  to  be  processed.  Note:  1ET,  FME,  and FED transactions are not authorized for NWRM equipment. 5.4.29.1.4.  The borrowing command will direct the AFMC for the borrowing base to process  an  FCI  to  establish  an  authorized/in-use  detail  record.  This  record  will include the following: 5.4.29.1.4.1.  ASC 064. 5.4.29.1.4.2.  Allowance ID suffix (the SRAN of the lending base). 5.4.29.1.4.3.  Zero as the authorized quantity. 5.4.29.1.4.4.  The number of items on loan as the on-hand quantity. 5.4.29.1.4.5.  The expiration date of the loan will be placed in the increment code field. 5.4.29.1.5.  When  the  loaned  equipment  is  received,  the  gaining  EAE  will  notify AFMC.  (T-2).  The  AFMC  will  use  the  manual  FED  procedures  to  process  the equipment.  Use  the  shipping  document  number  from  the  1ET  processed  by  the lending  base  and  the  Accounting  and  Finance  interface  code  EAID  to  properly account  for  the  receipt  of  the  lent  equipment.  However,  the  review  listings  do  not need to be processed. 5.4.29.1.6.  When the borrowing base returns the equipment  to  the lending base, the original loan will be the authorizing document for the return and AFMC will use 1ET to ship the equipment and FED to reestablish EAID accountability. 5.4.29.2.  Transfer  of  Accountability.  When  commands  use  these  equipment  loan procedures,  EAID  accountability  and  reporting  are  transferred  to  the  borrowing  base. Therefore,  both  the  lending  and  the  borrowing  commands  should  appoint  project managers  to  coordinate  the  above  procedures  with  AFMC,  especially  since  the  lent equipment  is  often  critical  to  support  the  mission.  When  the  loan  is  terminated,  the project  managers  should  make  sure  that  AFMC  returns  the  lent  equipment,  and reestablishes  accountability  at  the  lending  base.  The  project  manager  should  make  sure that  this  property  accountability  is  transferred  as  quickly  as  possible,  to  reduce  the  in transit time (the period when accountability is not established at either the loaning or the borrowing base) to an absolute minimum. 5.4.29.3.  When  the  MAJCOM  CEMO  directs  the  permanent  retention  of  loaned equipment, AFMC will change the EAID detail citing ASC 064 to the appropriate AS. 5.4.30.  Operations & Maintenance (O&M) & Investment Support Equipment. 5.4.30.1.  Purpose:  Describe  procedures  for  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  O&M  and  Investment Support  Equipment.    Explain  the  process  for  FY  buys  to  include  use  of  the  Equipment Requirements System (ERS) and Asset Distribution List (ADL), as well as management AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 271 of  the  Buy  Lists,  Current  Unfunded  Priority  Lists,  and  outline  the  process  for  a  Buy Budget Review for EEIC 638 O&M items. 5.4.30.2.  General  Discussion:  ERS  plays  a  vital  role  in  the  planning  and  budgeting processes, as well as the development of the Buy Lists and the Current Unfunded Priority List  (UFR).  ERS  is  used  by  the  MAJCOMs  to  view  and  assess  the  criticality  of  their requirements. Information file maintained in ERS by the MAJCOMs and AFMC is used to  compile and defend  O&M  and  Investment  POM,  Investment  Procurement Document (PDOC),  O&M  Execution  Plan,  and  O&M  Spend  Plan  submissions.  The  Equipment Prioritization  Model  (EPM),  an  underlying  module  within  ERS,  provides  the  baseline prioritization of equipment requirements. 5.4.30.3.  Equipment Requirement System (ERS). 5.4.30.3.1.  MAJCOM’s will assess the criticality of each of their requirements. This assessment will be used in the development of the Air Force Requirements Planning List (RPL), which ultimately results in the FY O&M Buy List and associated UFR, as well as forms the basis for the Spend Plan, Execution Plan, and POM submissions. 5.4.30.3.1.1.  MAJCOM  SE  POCs  will  assign  criticality  assessments  in  ERS  to requirements of centrally managed equipment items after proper coordination and validation with the applicable MAJCOMs Functional Area Managers (FAM) and CEMO. 5.4.30.3.1.2.  MAJCOMs  will  maintain  the  applicable  documentation  to  support the classification of Critical and Important requirements in ERS upon request by AFMC or HQ AF. 5.4.30.3.2.  ERS  will  initially  default  all  requirements  to  routine  (category  3). MAJCOMs  may  change  their  requirements  to  critical  (category  1),  important (category 2); or defer (category 4) the requirements. MAJCOMs may update ERS on a continual basis. 5.4.30.3.2.1.  Critical  criteria  is  work  stoppage  has  or  will  occur  with  no  work-around.  Safety  of  flight/safety  of  troops  affected.  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (JCS) project coded surge requirement. Resource Readiness reportable requirement; i.e., the Capability Readiness Assessment rating of the unit has been downgraded and comments  documented  in  the  current  Resource  reporting    report  identify  the particular  NSN  as  the  impacting  item.  Projected  delivery  date  will  not  allow initial operational capability (IOC) of new missions or conversions, as applicable. 5.4.30.3.2.2.  Important  criteria  is  current  asset  condition  may  cause  work stoppage.  Improved  safety  and  saved  resources  through  “latest  and  greatest technology  advances.  Projected  delivery  date  does  not  allow  full  operational capability (FOC) of new missions or conversions, as applicable. 5.4.30.3.2.3.  Routine: ERS default for all requirements. 5.4.30.3.2.4.  Defer  criteria  is  when  MAJCOM  determines  there  is  no  need  to satisfy  the  requirement  at  this  time.  MAJCOM  has  knowledge  the  requirement will  be  reduced;  i.e.,  Base  Realignment  and  Closure  (BRAC)  realignment; Allowance  Standard/Allowance  Authorization  reductions.  Base  has  a  non-272 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 preferred sub, but does not want a replacement. 5.4.30.3.3.  Buy List changes must be accomplished in ERS for O&M and Investment Buy  Lists.  The  “Buy  List”  screen  is  used  for  deletions;  and  the  “Current  Unfunded Priority List” is for additions. The Buy Lists identify buy requirements by MAJCOM and PE for O&M and by MAJCOM and Budget Program Activity Code (BPAC) for investment. 5.4.30.3.4.  Requisitions  must  be  selected  from  the  Asset  Distribution  List  (ADL), unless an alternative bed-down plan is in place having been coordinated and approved by AFMC and MAJCOM SE POC. Status of all selected requisitions must be updated in D035A. 5.4.30.3.4.1.  Agencies  using  an  alternative  bed-down  plan  must  identify  to  the applicable  IMS  and  MAJCOM  CEMO  SE  POCs  which  requisitions  will  be funded so they will be assigned status code “BV” to prevent duplicate funding. 5.4.30.3.5.  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  and  Air  Force  Reserve  (AFR)  retain ownership of their funding; however, they will follow the same procedures regarding development of the Buy List. 5.4.30.4.  Base  Expeditionary  Airfield  Resources  (BEAR).    The  BEAR  Program  Office will identify BEAR requisitions and contact the IMS to discuss the BEAR procurements and  associated  requisitions.  BEAR-specific  procurements  can  be  identified  by  their  PE (41135), which is reflected on the FY Buy List. 5.4.31.  Seized Equipment. 5.4.31.1.  Purpose:  Describe  procedures  for  equipment  seized  as  part  of  a  law enforcement  investigation.  Explain  the  process  of  accounting  for  seized  equipment  to include processes for CEMO, LRS EAO and equipment custodians. 5.4.31.1.1.  When equipment is seized, equipment custodians will: 5.4.31.1.2.  Contact  respective  LRS  EAE  for  coordination  to  CEMO  to  assign applicable ASC for seized equipment. 5.4.31.1.3.  Retain  evidence  receipt  (AF  Form  52  and  AF  From  1297)  until disposition instruction is received.  Forward a copy to LRS EAE for filing. 5.4.32.  FIAR Compliance: 5.4.32.1.  Key Supporting Documentation (KSD) is mandatory for each capitalized asset listed in the APSR to substantiate acquisition cost and date. The acquisition cost and date must match the cost and date of the KSD. Refer to OUSD (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer FIAR Guidance for details on allowable KSDs. 5.4.32.2.  Acquisition Cost. 5.4.32.2.1.  Original  acquisition  cost  includes  all  costs  incurred  to  bring  general property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) to a form and location suitable or its intended use (e.g., amounts paid to vendors, transportation to point of initial use, handling and storage  costs,  interest  costs  paid,  and  direct  and  indirect  production  costs).  This  is usually found on vendor invoice or DD Form 250 that accompany the asset. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 273 5.4.32.2.2.  DD Form 1348-1A (DOR/FED)  from Source of Supply (SOS) may also be used as a KSD, but only when an invoice or DD Form 250 cannot be found. 5.4.32.2.2.1.  To  obtain  a  DD  Form  1348-1A  (DOR/FED),  Query  the  supply system  and  trace  audit  trail  from  when  item  was  first  received  into  the  retail system from SOS. When the item was transferred from another base, continue to research using the other bases SRAN. 5.4.32.2.2.2.  Duplicate document when Document Control element does not have a  copy  on  file.  NOTE:  signatures  are  not  required  in  this  instance  if  original signed DD Form 1348 cleared through Document Control. 5.4.32.2.3.  When  historical  cost  information  for  existing  general  PP&E  is  not available, it should be valued/ recorded at estimated fair market value. The estimates should be based on the costs of similar assets at the time of acquisition, or the current costs  of  similar  assets  discounted  since  the  time  of  acquisition  (i.e.,  by  deflating current costs to costs at the time of acquisition by the general price index). 5.4.32.3.  Acquisition Date. 5.4.32.3.1.  General PP&E should be recorded when the title passes to the Air Force. Usually  found  on  same  KSD  as  acquisition  cost.  Note:  Acquisition  date  should  not match  the  date  asset  arrived  on  installation  if  property  was  gained  through  transfer from another unit. 5.4.32.3.2.  General  PP&E  acquired  under  a  capital  lease  should  be  recorded  as  an asset at lease inception. (T-1). 5.4.32.3.3.  For  constructed  assets  that  meet  the  capitalization  requirements,  the "acquisition date" should be the date the asset is placed in service. 5.4.32.3.4.  When  KSD  is  unavailable,  EAE  will  use  manufacturer  date  off  item identification plate as the acquisition date. When an item does not have manufacturer date, coordinate with organization to establish age of asset. 5.4.32.4.  CFO data: 5.4.32.4.1.  AFEMS CFO data must be updated accurately for the system to correctly calculate and report depreciation of capitalized assets.  (T-1). A CFO detail record is created in AFEMS for each CFO asset reported on-hand in the ILS-S system. 5.4.32.4.2.  Missing CFO data. 5.4.32.4.2.1.  Missing  CFO  data  occurs  when  an  item  is  first  receipted  or otherwise brought  onto  accountable records in  ILS-S. AFEMS reads the balance in ILS-S and builds a CFO detail with blank data elements awaiting user input. 5.4.32.4.2.2.  EAE  must  query  AFEMS  weekly  to  identify  CFO  details  with missing  data  elements,  contact  custodian  to  acquire  information  and  ensure AFEMS is updated accordingly. (T-2). 5.4.32.4.2.3.  Take  immediate  action  to  obtain  KSDs  on  newly  arrived  property and file per this instruction. 5.4.32.4.3.  CFO reconciliation. 274 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.4.32.4.3.1.  CFO  details  require  reconciliation  whenever  an  out  of  balance occurs  between  the  on  hand  balance  in  ILS-S  and  the  number  of  CFO  details reported in AFEMS. This often occurs when there are multiple CFO items in ILS-S  on  a  single  In-Use  detail  and  a  transaction  is  processed  in  ILS-S  reducing  the balance  (e.g.  TIN,  IAD,  etc.…).  AFEMS  does  not  know  which  corresponding CFO  detail  to  delete  and  an  out  of  balance  condition  occurs  until  manually rectified. 5.4.32.4.3.2.  EAE must query AFEMS weekly to identify CFO details requiring reconciliation  and  immediately  contact  custodian  to  delete  or  update  CFO  data IAW AFH 23-123, V3. (T-1) Section 5E—Document Control and Detail Records 5.5.  Document Control and Detail Records. 5.5.1.  Quality Control of Documents. 5.5.1.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  quality  control  procedures  for  documents.  For  policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.5.1.2.  General  Procedures  for  Quality  Control.  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activities will follow the procedures outlined below concerning the quality control of documents. 5.5.1.2.1.  Required  Documents.  Begin  by  comparing  the  information  on  the document  control  record  (DCR)  with  the  information  on  one  of  the  following:  the ILS-S  document,  or  Document  Control  copy  of  the  source  document.  When procedures  state  that  a  specific  copy  of  a  document  is  to  be  used  as  the  Document Control copy, the most legible copy may be substituted when the document specified is  marred  or  hard  to  read.  Also,  verify  all  accountable  equipment  documents  are signed  for  by  the  applicable  equipment  custodian.  Additionally,  ensure  only individuals  officially  appointed  as  inspectors  verify  condition  of  property.  Note: Automated  document  control  uses  the  DCR  from  the  microcomputer  database  to make  these  comparisons  (see  Document  Control  Record  (DCR)  paragraph  of  this document). 5.5.1.2.2.  Filing DCR. DCRs are created by the applicable ILS-S during end-of-day processing. 5.5.1.2.3.  Filing source documents. Generally, source documents are filed according to  organization  and  ascending  document  number  to  match  the  document  control record sequence. 5.5.1.2.4.  Weapons  Inventory  Listing  (CA/CRL  R-14).  Document  Control  will maintain  a  signed  copy  of  the  Weapons  Inventory  Listing  IAW  AFRIMS.  If discrepancies are discovered, a letter must be attached to the listing summarizing the results  of  the  inventory,  any  differences,  and  the  action  taken  to  correct  the differences.  The  Materiel  Management  Officer  must  sign  the  letter  and  the  LRS CC/AO must approve it. (T-1). 5.5.1.2.5.  Matching.  To  match  document  control  records  with  their  documents,  use the  last  8  positions  of  the  document  number.  Exception:  For  stock-funded,  locally AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 275 manufactured  items  the  document  control  records  will  contain  the  organization  and shop  code  of  the  manufacturing  activity  in  positions  30-35.  Note:  The  Document Control copy for these receipts will contain the base stock record account number in the document number field of the materiel management document. 5.5.1.2.6.  Errors. When you find an error or an omission that you can correct, do so. Return the document to the responsible activity for immediate corrections. 5.5.1.2.7.  Disposition.  After  the  documents  are  validated  and  the  required  quality control  checks  are  performed,  either  destroy  it  or  place  it  in  a  valid  document  file. Note:  Bases in  wartime categories 1, 2, and 3 must validate only the signature on a document. 5.5.2.  Shipment Suspense Processing. 5.5.2.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  quality  control  procedures  for  Shipment  Suspense Processing.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.5.2.2.  General  Procedures for  Shipment  Suspense  Processing.  LRS/Materiel Management  Activities  are  to  follow  the  procedures  outlined  below  concerning  the management  of  Shipment  Suspense  Processing.  This  section  describes  the  procedures that Document Control uses to manage the shipments both with and without the CMOS interface.  Shipments  without  the  CMOS  interface  are  controlled  by  using  the  shipment suspense  file  and  either  a  shipment  suspense  detail  or  shipped  not  credited  detail. Shipments using the CMOS interface are controlled entirely by either a SSC or a SNC. 5.5.2.3.  Shipment Suspense (SSC) Output. The ILS-S will provide an output of an SSC image  under  several  conditions  when  not  operating  with  the  CMOS  interface.  These conditions are described below. 5.5.2.4.  Bases operating with a CMOS interface. 5.5.2.4.1.  Redistribution  Order  and  Referral  Order  Inputs.  With  these  inputs,  the ILSS will output an SSC and also  create a shipment suspense detail when shipment action  is  initiated.  For  each  different  stock  number,  system  designator,  document number,  and/or  suffix  code  that  is  shipped,  there  will  be  one  SSC  output  and  one shipment suspense detail established. 5.5.2.4.2.  Replies to  Reports of Customer Excess. With these inputs, the  ILS-S will output an SSC and create a SNC detail when credit return shipment action is initiated. 5.5.2.4.3.  DLADS  Transfer  Inputs.  These  inputs  will  produce  an  SSC  and  build  a shipment suspense detail. The SSC output will contain a T in position 7. 5.5.2.4.4.  CMOS  Interface  Processing.  When  the  CMOS  interface  is  in  operation, Document  Control  does  not  retain  shipment  documents  and  transfers  to  off-base DLADS and off-base organizations. 5.5.2.4.4.1.  A  SSC  detail  or  a  SNC  detail  is  created  and  an  electronic  image  is sent  to  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity.  SSC  images  are  not  created because  CMOS  generates  SSC  inputs  and  automatically  updates  the  shipment suspense/shipped not credited details with the in checker identification code, date 276 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 in-checked, TCN, date shipped, and mode of shipment code. 5.5.2.4.4.2.  There are exceptions when Document Control must manually update details. The Customer Support NCOIC assigns a three-digit numerical in checker code  to  each  person  in  Document  Control,  and  any  other  authorized  outside activities when approved by the LRS CC/AO, to be used when processing manual updates.  These  codes  must  be  controlled.  Use  the  following  procedures  when processing these exceptions: 5.5.2.4.4.2.1.  Downgraded  Low  Dollar  Value  Property.  When  low  dollar value  property  is  authorized  to  be  downgraded  to  scrap  and  not  sent  to DLADS,  the  inspector  sends  a  copy  of  the  document  to  Document  Control. Document Control personnel processes an SSC to update the applicable detail with the in checker code and date. A TCN is assigned in accordance with SSC input format and Entry requirement in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 5.5.2.4.4.2.2.  Non-CMOS Property Transfers. When property is moved from one account to another and not moved through the LRS/Materiel Management Activity,  a  TEX  code  will  be  used  to  bypass  CMOS.  A  DCR  will  be established  and  a  signed  document  will  be  returned,  cleared,  and  filed  under normal document control procedures. 5.5.2.4.4.3.  Procedures  for  Degraded  Operations  Recovery.  During these operations,  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  enters  data  for  each transaction  manually.  All  SSCs  for  these  transactions  are  stored  in  the  ILS-S interface  until  recovery  is  complete.  When  the  interface  is  activated,  the  SSC transactions are processed. 5.5.2.4.5.  Transfer of Property to DLADS. When property is moved to the DLADS, the  customer  is  responsible  for  ensuring  a  signed  copy  of  the  transfer  document  is provided  to  Document  Control.  Shipment  suspense  details  are  created  to  use  for DLADS  confirmation  and  follow-up  (see  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  3,  Ch  8  for  more information  on  in-transit  control  system  transaction  flow).  A  DCR  is  created  and  a signed  document  is  returned  to  Document  Control  and  cleared  under  normal document control procedures. 5.5.2.4.6.  Deployed  MRSP  Details.  When  MRSPs  are  deployed,  each  detail  is flagged to create off-base releases of property. Normally, these must pass through the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. When MRSPs are about to be returned and the MRSP personnel do not want to ship items to the deployed location, they should sign for  the  property  and  send  a  signed  copy  to  Document  Control.  Document  Control clears the document. These documents are then filed as normal. 5.5.3.  Automated Document Control. 5.5.3.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  Procedures  for  Automated  Document  Control.  For policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use  AFH 23-123. 5.5.3.2.  General  Procedures  for  Automated  Document  Control.  The  following  actions pertain  to  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  utilizing  an  Automated  Document AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 277 Control. Procedures concerning document removal, document signatures, specific quality control  checks,  control  checks  for  supporting  documentation,  document  verification procedures  for  DLADS  in-transit  control  program,  degraded  operations  document processing,  delinquent  document file requirements  are  explained  in  other  sections  concerning  Document  Control  in  this manual. requirements,  and  permanent  document 5.5.3.3.  Any  document  can  be  printed  from  the  Automated  Document  Control  system (AIS) by Document Control. 5.5.3.4.  Exceptions  to  Procedures.  The  following  is  a  list  of  changes  arising  from automating document control. 5.5.3.4.1.  Modified  delinquent  date.  Normally,  documents  must  be  processed  and cleared within five calendar days or they become delinquent. Documents that have a delinquency standard other than five calendar days, require that the document control record  be  annotated  with  the  modified  delinquent  date.  Document  Control  uses  the Change  Work  File  to  enter  the  Julian  date  showing  the  modified  delinquent  date  in the OPR field of the DCR. 5.5.3.4.2.  Document Control Record (DCR). It is Document Control's responsibility to maintain the DCR data file. Document Control performs the quality control checks then  updates  the  DCR  database  using  the  personal  computer  process.  More information on DCRs can be found in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 5.5.3.4.3.  DSD. Document Control creates and loads the DSD record on the database (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for procedures) and deletes the DSD when it is cleared. 5.5.3.5.  DDL.  Document  Control  provides  a  two-part  Delinquent  Document  Listing—part one for Document Control and part two for all other functions. Each part is further broken into pre-delinquent and delinquent listings. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for more information. 5.5.3.6.  CTH Inquiries. Document Control processes TIP/BATCH CTH inquiries from a terminal  through  screen  inputs  (see  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  5  for  CTH  inquiry procedures). 5.5.3.7.  Automated  reversal.  Document  Control  processes  reversal  inputs  on  CTH records. The automated program creates the reversal inputs and displays them for review before processing. Review the automated reversal procedures IAW AFMAN 23-122. 5.5.3.8.  Personal  Computers.  Procedures  for  the  automated  processing  of  document control records are in Automated Document Control. 5.5.4.  Filing Documents. 5.5.4.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  quality  control  procedures  for  filing  documents.  For policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use  AFH 23-123. 5.5.4.2.  General Procedures for Filing Documents. LRS/Materiel Management activities to follow the procedures outlined below concerning the filing of documents. 278 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.5.4.3.  Required Checks. Before filing documents, complete all required quality control checks. These are outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 of this instruction. Once all checks for completeness are accomplished, the document(s) may be filed. 5.5.4.4.  Document Filing. 5.5.4.4.1.  Arrange documents in Julian date serial number sequence. 5.5.4.4.2.  Remove the corresponding document control suspense record from the file. 5.5.4.4.3.  Do  a  quality  control  check.  If  the  document  control  suspense  record  and the source document do not match, correct the errors using the instructions in Sec. 5F. If  the  DCR  and  the  source  document  match  use  the  code  in  position  53  to  tell  you which of the following actions to take: 5.5.4.4.3.1.  All  materiel  management  activities  will  retain  all  source  documents with TRICS ISU, DOR, MSI, SHP, AXA, BSU, FCH, and FCU for 75 months (6 years  and  3  months)  regardless  of  what  is  in  position  53.  (T-1).  The  materiel management  accounts  with  an  applicable  materiel  management  automated tracking  system  do  not  need  to  maintain  paper  copies  if  the  transaction  was processed through this automated system. These transactions must be retained in this automated system for 75 months. All other transactions not processed through this  automated  tracking  system  will  be  maintained  using  the  current  Document Control Imaging System (DCIS). The materiel management accounts that have a DCIS  or  like  system  may  continue  to  use  the  system  instead  of  filing  paper copies. 5.5.4.5.  All other TRICs. 5.5.4.5.1.  When  an  F  appears  in  position  53,  file  the  source  document  in  the appropriate document file and destroy the document control record. 5.5.4.5.2.  When  a  D  appears  in  position  53,  destroy  both  the  source  document  and the document control record. 5.5.4.5.3.  When  an  audit,  inspection,  or  other  reason  requires  Document  Control  to keep documents you usually destroy after a specific time, maintain the documents in a separate file. Do not mix them with documents normally filed by Document Control. Batch file them without regard to any filing sequence. 5.5.5.  Processing Degraded Operations Documents. 5.5.5.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  procedures  for  processing  degraded  operations documents.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific guidance use AFH 23-123. for  Processing  Degraded  Operations  Documents. 5.5.5.2.  General  Procedures LRS/Materiel  Management  activities  are  to  follow  the  procedures  outlined  below concerning the processing of degraded operations documents. 5.5.5.3.  General  Issues,  Releases,  and  Shipments.  Once  the  appropriate  signature  has been  obtained,  Document  Control  will  receive  copy  1  of  all  degraded  operations documents. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 279 5.5.5.3.1.  Maintain these documents in a suspense file according to ascending Julian date serial number. 5.5.5.3.2.  When  the  transaction  appears  on  the  Document  Register,  perform  quality control IAW AFMAN 23-122 and AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5. 5.5.5.3.3.  When  the  document  is  one  that  Document  Control  must  keep,  file  the handwritten accountable materiel management document in the permanent document file. 5.5.5.4.  Returns. Inbound Cargo or designated return point will send a copy of all returns to Document Control. 5.5.5.4.1.  Maintain returns in a suspense file in document number order. 5.5.5.4.2.  When  the  return  appears  on  the  Document  Register,  perform  quality control checks outlined in AFMAN 23-122, Quality Control of Records and AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5. Note: Single returns with partial credit return require special processing.  There  will  be  two  document  control  records  (DCR)  representing  a separate  transaction  for  these  returns.  You  must  consider  the  total  action  quantity shown when you perform the quality control check. When reversal action is required, you must process separate inputs for each transaction. 5.5.6.  The Delinquent Document Listing. 5.5.6.1.  Purpose: To explain the quality control procedures for managing the Delinquent Document  Listing.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.5.6.2.  General  Procedures  for  the  Delinquent  Document  Listing.  LRS/Materiel Management  Activities  are  to  follow  the  procedures  outlined  below  concerning  the management of the Delinquent Document Listing. 5.5.6.2.1.

Hold  delinquent document meetings as needed with LRS/Materiel Management Activities. 5.5.6.2.3.  Distribute  the  Listing.  Distribute  copies  of  the  delinquent  listing  to  the applicable  LRS  flights  and  other  Materiel  Management  activities  as  well  as  other agencies  local  management  has  chosen.  Document  Control  keeps  one  copy  of  the listing. 5.5.6.2.4.  Annotate  listing.  Annotate  Document  Control's  copy  of  the  delinquent listing to mark the documents still being processed and the flight responsible. 5.5.6.2.5.  Destruction  of  the  delinquent  listing.  The  Document  Control  copy  of  the delinquent listing may be destroyed after the next day's run of the listing is annotated. 5.5.6.2.6.  Further  Actions  for  Delinquent  Documents.  Begin  aggressive  action  to locate  documents  the  first  day  they  appear  on  the  delinquent  document  listing  and continue  the  research  on  the  second  day.  When  a  document  is  still  missing  after  it 280 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 appears on three daily listings. Obtain a duplicate or prepare a replacement. Actions will depend on the type of document being reviewed and at what stage in processing it is lost or missing. 5.5.6.2.6.1.  Lost  Documents.  If  the  intended  receiver  has  no  record  of  and  does not  have  the  property,  prepare  a  replacement  document,  initiate  a  mandatory special inventory, and complete issue or shipping action. If the special inventory shows  that  a  shortage  exists,  Inventory  will  start  proper  action.  The  inventory results will support the complete inventory adjustment. When no shortage exists, file the completed replacement document. No record reversal action is necessary. 5.5.6.2.6.2.  Lost document certification. If a signed copy of 1, 2, 3, or 4 from the original set or a reproduction cannot be found, then a replacement document will be created with a certificate of lost document stamped or typed on the Document Control  copy.  This  certificate  will  state  that  a  thorough  search  has  been  made. Include  any  other  details  important  enough  to  mention.  Forward  to  Document Control  for  filing.  Note:  A  duplicate  means  copy  1,  2,  3,  or  4  of  the  original document. A replacement is a hand scribed or typed copy to look like the original. the lost shipping  document  exists.  Contact 5.5.6.2.6.3.  Procedures  for  lost  DLADS  shipping  documents:  First,  see  if  a duplicate  copy  of the custodian/activity, local LRS/transportation activity, or the local DLADS that was to  receive  the  property  to  see  if  copy  2,  3,  or  4  of  the  shipping  document  is available. If a duplicate copy is available, it may be used without certification. If it  is  not,  then  prepare  a  replacement.  The  replacement  will  be  signed  by  the intended  custodian  or  activity,  the  local  LRS/transportation  activity,  or  the  local DLADS. Send a copy of the certified document to the intended receiver. 5.5.6.2.7.  Follow-up. Complete follow-up actions on delinquent documents each day until the document(s) is/are received. 5.5.6.2.8.  Notify Leadership as necessary. 5.5.7.  Delinquent Shipment Listing. 5.5.7.1.  Purpose: To explain the procedures for management of the Delinquent Shipment Listing. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.5.7.2.  General  Procedures  for  Management  of  the  Delinquent  Shipment  Listing. LRS/Materiel  Management  Activities  are  to  follow  the  procedures  outlined  below concerning  the  management  of  the  Delinquent  Shipment  Listing.  This  listing  provides Document  Control  with  a  list  of  all  shipment  transactions  for  which  the  SSC  detail  or SNC  detail  has  not  been  updated  with  transportation  data  (TCN,  in  checker  code,  in checker  date,  mode  of  shipment,  and  date  shipped)  using  the  SSC  input.  Detailed instructions for the Delinquent Shipment Program are contained in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6. Additionally, more information concerning Shipment Suspense detail records can be found in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 8. 5.5.7.3.  Processing Frequency. Document Control requests that the delinquent shipment listing  be  processed  every  2  weeks.  When  the  base  is  using  the  automated  applicable AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 281 SBSS/CMOS interface, the listing should be processed each week. More information on the interface of the materiel management and transportation systems can be found in Sec. 7C, and AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 7. 5.5.7.4.  Output. The delinquent shipment listing is produced in six parts: 5.5.7.4.1.  Parts  I  and  II  contain  delinquent  SSC  and  SNC  records  which  have  not been updated with transportation data. Parts I and II are not produced when the base is using the automated SBSS/CMOS interface. 5.5.7.4.2.  Part  III  contains  both  SSC  and  SNC  detail  records  for  which  the LRS/transportation activity has provided only an estimated date the item was shipped and  a  transportation  hold  code  was  not  provided.  These  details  are  identified  by  an asterisk (*) in position 1 of the TCN field. Part III is not produced when the base is using the automated SBSS/CMOS interface. 5.5.7.4.3.  Part  IV  contains  a  separate  list  of  delinquent  shipment  suspense  detail records  for  all  transfers  to  DLADS  which  were  shipped  through  the  base LRS/transportation  activity  channels  but  have  not  been  updated  with  an  SSC  input. The  delinquent  shipment  listing  determines  whether  LRS/transportation  activity  or the LRS/Materiel Management Activity delivery was used for disposal documents by checking the “TMO-DRMO-DELIVERY-FLG” on the 516 record. If the flag is set to a  “T”,  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  delivers  the  shipment  directly  to DLADS. This part is not produced if DLADS shipments are delivered directly by the LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  or  if  the  base  is  using  the  automated SBSS/CMOS interface. 5.5.7.4.4.  Part  V  is  produced  only  when  the  automated  SBSS/CMOS  interface  is being  used.  The  listing  contains  all  SSC  and  SNC  records  for  which  the LRS/transportation activity has not provided an in checker code and in checker date. 5.5.7.4.5.  Part VI is produced for those SSC  and SNC records where the in checker code and date are present but the TCN and/or Mode of Shipment are/is blank. 5.5.7.4.6.  Processing  Parts  I,  II,  and  IV  for  Bases  not  using  the  SBSS/CMOS Interface. 5.5.7.5.  Document  Control  Actions.  To  process  parts  I,  II,  and  IV  details,  check  1) previous  delinquent  shipment  listings  provided  by  the  LRS/transportation  activity  for transportation  data,  2)  any  unprocessed the LRS/transportation  activity  and  3)  delinquent  document  files.  Line  off  any  entry  on  the listing found during the above checks so the LRS/transportation activity does not review these  details.  Enter  any  unprocessed  transportation  data  found  on  an  SSC  input  and process to the ILS-S. Forward the updated delinquent shipment listing (original and one copy  with  carbon,  do  not  separate)  to  the  LRS/transportation  activity  within  1calendar day after receiving the listing. transportation  data  provided  by 5.5.7.6.  LRS/transportation  activity  processing  actions.  To  process  the  delinquent shipment listing, the LRS/transportation activity will follow the steps below: 5.5.7.6.1.  Review  the  delinquent  shipment  listing  against  appropriate  materiel management documents. 282 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.5.7.6.2.  Return  copies  of  these  documents  with  the  listing  if  they  have  not previously been provided to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. 5.5.7.6.3.  When  copies  have  been  sent  to  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity, the  LRS/transportation  activity  will  enter  the  transportation  data  on  the  listing  and return the annotated listing to Document Control for processing of an SSC input. 5.5.7.6.4.  When  the  LRS/transportation  activity  cannot  provide  either  hold  data  or TCN/GBL,  but  is  sure  the  shipment  was  made  on  a  specific  Julian  date,  it  will provide these data. 5.5.7.7.  Document Control Actions. transportation 5.5.7.7.1.  When  Document  Control  receives  either  copies  of documents or the annotated delinquent shipment listing, enter the TCN/GBL data in the SSCs and input them to the ILS-S to update the SSC detail. to  see 5.5.7.7.2.  When  the  LRS/transportation  activity  is  sure  a  shipment  was  made  on  a specific  Julian  date  but  cannot  provide  hold  data  or  TCN/GBL,  Document  Control will  check the LRS/transportation  activity  is  on  file.  When  a  document  is  on  file,  then  enter  the following data on the SSC input: an asterisk (*) in position 62 and the Julian date of the  shipment  in  positions  63-66.  Next  process  the  SSC  image  to  update  the  SSC detail. that  a  completed  shipment  document  signed  by listing shipment for  which contains  SSC/SNC  details 5.5.7.7.3.  Part  III  Processing  for  Bases  without  CMOS  Interface.  Part  III  of  the delinquent the LRS/transportation  activity  has  provided  an  estimated  date  shipped  and  a transportation  hold  code  was  not  provided.  The  estimated  date  shipped,  as  provided by  the  LRS/  transportation  activity,  will  appear  in  the  date  shipped  field  of  the SSC/SNC  detail.  This  part  of  the  listing  provides  information  about  the  number  of shipments  the  LRS/transportation  activity  makes  for  which  the  ILS-S  has  been provided  no  TCN/GBL  or  hold  code.  If  the  LRS/transportation  activity  has  the TCN/GBL for a shipment that appears in this part of the listing, it will send a copy of the  materiel  management  document  along  with  the  listing.  Document  Control  will then  use  the  TCN/GBL  to  process  the  appropriate  SSC  input  and  update  the SSC/SNC detail. 5.5.7.7.4.  Part V Processing for Bases with CMOS Interface. Part V of the delinquent shipment  listing  will  include  those  SSC/SNC  details  which  have  no  in  checker number  or  in  checker  date the LRS/transportation activity has not received the property for shipment. the  detail.  This indication is  an that in 5.5.7.7.5.  Document  Control  must  check  with  the  section  shipping  the  materiel  to ensure the property has been moved, and no delays in shipping have occurred. (T-2). When delays have occurred, line through the items  that  have not  been forwarded to the  LRS/transportation  activity the LRS/transportation  activity.  The  LRS/transportation  activity  will  use  the  listing  to either  provide  transportation  data  or  annotate  the  listing  with  no  record  of  the shipment found. The listing will then be returned to Document Control. for  shipment.  Forward listing the to AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 283 5.5.7.7.6.  For  any  item  that  the  LRS/transportation  activity  has  no  record  of  the shipment, record reversal or special inventory procedures will be followed. 5.5.7.7.6.1.  When inventory results indicate an overage equal to (or greater than) the quantity on the shipment document exists then prepare a certified replacement document  and  complete  the  shipping  action.  No  inventory  adjustment  for  the shipment quantity or record reversal and correction action is necessary. 5.5.7.7.6.2.  When  inventory  results  do  not  indicate  an  overage  equal  to  (or greater than) the quantity  on the shipment  document exists then further  research may be necessary. 5.5.7.7.7.  Part  VI  Processing  for  Bases  with  CMOS  Interface.  Part  VI  of  the delinquent  shipment  listing  will  include  those  SSC/SNC  details  which  have  the  in checker code and date in the detail but lack the TCN and Mode of Shipment. This is an  indication  that  the  LRS/transportation  activity  has  received  the  property  but  not released it for shipment. should  be  annotated  and 5.5.7.7.8.  Part  VI the LRS/transportation  activity  for  research.  The  LRS/transportation  activity  must provide the missing data and/or conduct research to verify receipt by the consignee of the shipment. The listing will then be returned to Document Control. Note: Manually processed  SSCs  must  also  include  the  date  shipped.  This  date  is  used  to  Shipment Suspense Record deletion during follow-up. forwarded  directly to 5.5.8.  Monitoring Authorizations to Receipt for Property. 5.5.8.1.  Purpose:  To explain the procedures for  monitoring authorizations to  receipt for property.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.5.8.2.  General  Procedures  for  Monitoring  Authorizations  to  Receipt  for  Property. LRS/Materiel  Management  activities  are  to  follow  the  procedures  outlined  below concerning the monitoring authorizations to receipt for property. 5.5.8.3.  Initiating Activity Responsibilities. The organization commander to  include the LRS CC/AO must do the following: 5.5.8.3.1.  Submit  a  letter  to  the  Customer  Support  which  identifies  individuals authorized  to  receive  classified  and  NWRM  property.  (T-1).  The  letter  will  contain the data elements specified in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5, Receipt Authorization Record for Classified/NWRM Property. 5.5.8.3.2.  For munitions, the initiating activity will follow the specific requirements in AFI 21-201 and AFI 21-204, Nuclear Accountability Procedures. 5.5.8.3.3.  For Classified equipment, the initiating activity will submit all requests to appoint  or  change  a  custodian  directly  to  the  EAE.  EAE  maintains  the  custodian authorization  receipt  file  according  to  Sec.  5D.  EAE  will  provide  a  copy  of  this request  (letter)  to  Document  Control  or  Customer  Support  so  they  can  update  the Authorization Receipt Listing and notify internal LRS/Materiel Management Activity agencies of the change/update. (T-1). 284 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.5.8.3.4.  Every June and December the initiating activity reviews the Authorization Receipt Listing provided by the LRS CC/AO, annotates required changes, signs and dates the listing, and returns it to the LRS CC/AO. 5.5.8.3.5.  Retain  the  Classified  and  NWRM  Authorization  Receipt  Listing  from Document Control or Customer Support until it receives an updated listing. (T-1). 5.5.8.4.  Responsibility  of  the  LRS  CC/AO.  The  LRS  CC/AO  will  provide  a  letter  of receipt authorization to activities that can process classified and NWRM property. (T-1). This  letter  will  identify  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  representatives authorized to receive classified and NWRM property. 5.5.8.5.  Responsibilities  of  Document  Control  or  Customer  Support.  For  classified receipt authorizations for and NWRM property, Document Control or Customer Support will: 5.5.8.5.1.  Prepare  Classified  and  NWRM  Authorization  Receipt  Listing  from  the receipt authorizations. Document Control will send a complete copy to each internal LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity.  (T-1).  One  copy  will  be  used  to  provide supported  activities  with  a  list  of  individuals  authorized  to  receive  classified  and NWRM property for their organization. 5.5.8.5.2.  Record  all  changes  to  the  current  Classified  and  NWRM  Authorization Receipt Listing. Beginning with 1, number each change to the listing. Notify internal LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  activities  and  the  supported  agencies  either  by letter  or  listing.  Note:  Changes  to  the  current  activity  requesting  the  change,  receipt listing do not require you to process a complete new listing. 5.5.8.5.3.  Perform a semiannual revalidation of authorizations to receipt for classified and NWRM property each June and December. The validations are done by sending organizations  a  copy  of  their  portion  of  the  authorization  listing  which  is  prepared from  the  file  maintained  according  to  this  paragraph.  Necessary  additions,  changes, and  deletions  are  annotated  by  the  organizations  and  the  listings  are  returned  to Document  Control  or  Customer  Support.  Document  Control  or  Customer  Support then updates the file and produces a new, updated listing for distribution according to this paragraph. Section 5F—Record Reversal and Correction 5.6.  Record Reversal and Correction. 5.6.1.  Record Reversal and Correction Research. 5.6.1.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  record  reversal  and  correction  research  procedures process. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.6.1.2.  General  Discussion:  Inadequate  research and subject  knowledge  could result in rejects  or  erroneous  inventory  adjustments  (i.e.  Transaction  Identification  Codes (TRIC’s),  Type  Transaction  Phrase  Codes  (TTPC),  and  reversal  sequence).  Reversible TRIC’s and TTPC’s are located in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. The key is the word “reverse.”  The  reversible  transactions  that  appear  on  the  CTH  will  be  processed  in AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 285 reversal order according to TRIC’s and TTPC’s. Instructions on considerations for detail records  i.e.,  Special  Purpose  Recoverable  Asset  Maintenance  (SPRAM),  War  Reserve Materiel  (WRM),  Mission  Support  Kit  (MSK),  Readiness  Spares  Packages  (RSP),  In-Place  Readiness  Spares  Packages  (IRSP)  and  Due  In  From  Maintenance  (DIFM)  are located in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. Guidance on Material Support Division prices on the transaction history is located in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. Moving Average Costs required for Reversal Records are located in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 5.6.1.3.  The following actions are performed in order: 5.6.1.3.1.  From  research:  determine  the  TRICS,  TTPC,  and  record  reversal processing order utilizing appropriate IT systems. 5.6.1.3.1.1.  Process  a  stock  number  inquiry  to  obtain  interchangeable  items  and substitutes in appropriate IT system. 5.6.1.3.1.2.  Process a consolidated transaction history record (CTH) on all relate stock numbers in appropriate IT system. 5.6.1.3.1.3.  After determining that a record reversal  correction is  needed:  assign freeze code “Q” to all affected item records utilizing the appropriate IT systems. Information  addressing  Freeze  Code  “Q”  and  its  effects  on  record  reversal  and correction in the appropriate IT system is located in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5,  Item  Record  Preparation  for  Record  Reversal.  Note:  AFMC  will  coordinate with  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  prior  to  processing  record  reversal and  correction  transactions  on  shipments  and  RDOs  to  ensure  property  has  not departed from the base. 5.6.1.3.1.4.  Print a copy of the freeze code load notice and attach it to the reversal record source document. 5.6.1.3.1.5.  Fill out reversal record source document for processing in appropriate TRIC/TTPC transaction sequence. 5.6.1.3.1.6.  Forward  the  reversal  record  source  document  to  LRS  CC/AO designated personnel to process reversal inputs. 5.6.1.4.  Determine the proper sequence for record reversal. When responsible for record reversals  determine  the  proper  sequence  of  each  transaction,  i.e.  due-out  releases (DOR’s) before receipts (REC’s), etc. 5.6.1.5.  When  processing  the  record  reversal,  coordinate  with  Asset  Management  to determine  correct  quantities,  unit  of  issue  or  stock  numbers  when  necessary  to  ensure accurate processing of the record reversal. 5.6.2.  Automated Record Reversal. 5.6.2.1.  Purpose: To explain the reversal inputs for Automated Record Reversal from the Consolidated  Transaction  History  records  that  has  been  researched  by  the  initiator.  For policy  specific  requirements  review,  AFI-23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use  AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 5.6.2.2.  General  Discussion:  Only  one  TRIC  can  be  processed  at  a  time  when  utilizing this program. Be sure to process the individual TRIC’s in the reversal order you identify. 286 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 All  information  and  requirements  for  normal  record  reversal  processing  also  applies  to the  automated  record  reversal.  Inputs  on  the  applicable  IT  systems  require  the  TTPC, date,  and  serial  number  of  the  transaction  you  want  to  reverse.  This  includes  TTPC’s from all stock numbers that are applicable to the transaction being reversed. 5.6.2.2.1.  Review  all  prefilled  areas  on  record  reversal  screen  for  accuracy  before input. 5.6.2.2.2.  Ensure the cursor is placed at the end of the last field on the screen before transmitting. 5.6.3.  Steps of Document Distribution. 5.6.3.1.  Purpose: To identify possible steps to ensure the capture of record reversal and correction documentation. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.6.3.2.  This procedure will help with the quality assurance of the process of getting the reversal out of the system. 5.6.3.2.1.  The  initiator  will  forward  the  record  reversal  and  correction  request  to his/her assigned supervisor. (T-3). 5.6.3.2.2.  Upon  supervisor  approval,  the  initiator  will  provide  the  request  to  the Materiel Management Flight Commander /Chief for approval. (T-3). 5.6.3.2.3.  After  Materiel  Management  Flight  leadership  approval,  the  initiator  will provide the request to the Record Reversal monitor for processing the reversal. (T-3). 5.6.3.2.4.  The initiator records the dates and transaction serial numbers on the record reversal  and  correction  log.  Sample  log  is  located  in  Document  Identifier  Code (DIC)/Transaction Identifier Code (TRIC) Authorized Record Reversal, AFH 23-123, Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5.  If  the  type  of  transaction  was  a  receipt  and  multiple  inputs  were required, enter the date and 3333transaction serial numbers which were applicable to type transaction phrase codes (2T, 1Y, or 1W), since no output documents are created for these TTPCs. 5.6.3.2.5.  Record  Reversal  and  Correction  Action  monitor  will  forward  the  original output to Document Control for filing. 5.6.3.2.5.1.  AFMC will process their own record reversal and correction actions. AFMC will retain record reversal and correction documentation and will forward a copy to the base for document control purposes. 5.6.3.2.6.  Additional  copy  of  output  provided  to  initiator  for  corrective  action  after reversal of transaction to ensure all reversal actions were completed. 5.6.3.2.7.  After verification of completion of all reversal actions, additional copies of output documentation should be destroyed. 5.6.3.2.8.  Notify  stock  control  of  all  transactions  affecting  unserviceable  details  in order to report or to delete excess detail records. 5.6.4.  Forced Record Alteration. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 287 5.6.4.1.  Purpose: Occasionally, there will be conditions created on a database that cannot be corrected by processing normal transactions. When these conditions exist the records must be altered or deleted. There are conditions where record alterations should never be used; this includes QLP with update, and DBE (Database Editor). It is mandatory that all errors should be corrected by processing a normal input or a series of inputs, such as file maintenance,  reverse-post,  or  inventory  adjustments  in  lieu  of  a  Forced  Record Alteration.  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  3,  Ch  3  contains  more  information  on  forced  record alteration process, for other policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101. 5.6.4.2.  Caution:  Forced  Record  Alteration  processing  input  images  are  not  written  to audit trail tape. 5.6.4.3.  Forced  Record  Alteration  processing.  This  program  will  permit  alteration  or deletion  of  records  on  the  database.  The  execution  of  this  program  is  restricted  and should  only  be  executed  by  personnel  who  are  familiar  with  database  management system  commands  and  the  structure  of  the  database.  All  Forced  Record  Alteration requests  will  be  reviewed  and  approved  by the  Materiel  Management  Flight Commander/Chief  and  AFMC.  AFMC  and  Contingency  account  Record  Alteration Requests will be reviewed/approved by AFMC only." 5.6.4.3.1.  After  documentation  has  been  reviewed  and  approved  the  LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  requesting  activity  will  submit  a  Forced  Record  Alteration request AFMC website RECORD https://private.amc.af.mil/635SCMG/CST/SCMGeFORCED ALTERATION/  for  processing.  If  the  reason  for  the  request  was  for  system  related errors  include  the  Difficulty  Report  (DIREP)  or  Computer  Systems  Discrepancy (CSD) ticket number as part of the Forced Record Alteration documentation. using the 5.6.4.3.2.  After  processing,  AFMC  or  Computer  Operations  will  provide  both  the before and after image and annotate the output document with an explanation of why an  alteration  was  made,  as  well  as  the  date  completed.  The  document  must  also indicate  if  A&F  and  satellites  or  other  type  stock  record  account  records  were affected.  The  Forced  Record  Alteration  output  will  be  signed  by  AFMC.  For  base level  generated  Forced  Record  Alterations  AFMC  personnel  will  provide  the electronic  copy  to  the  requesting/owning  account  for  filing  through  their  website https://private.amc.af.mil/635SCMG/CST/SCMGeFORCED RECORD ALTERATION/. 5.6.4.3.3.  The  original  copy  of  the  document,  all  supporting  documentation,  and  a signed Consolidated Inventory Adjustment Document (IAD) Register will be filed in the  Document  Control.  Each  document  produced  by  a  record  being  changed  or deleted is assigned a serial number under program control. The serial number consists of a 4-digit Julian date and a 4-position serial number. The serial number portion of the control number is  stored in  the inventory  adjustment record and is  updated each time a document is produced. The latest serial number will be printed on the monthly Consolidated  Inventory  Adjustment  Document  Register  allowing  Document  Control to account for record alterations. 5.6.4.3.4.  Once  a  month,  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Forced  Record  Alterations  file. Compare the number of documents in the file with the last serial number used for the 288 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 month,  printed  on  the  monthly  Consolidated  IAD  Register.  If  the  Register  Serial Number and the file do not agree, the following procedure is used to account for and correct the difference: 5.6.4.3.4.1.  Conduct  an  extensive  search  to  determine  the  reason  for  the disagreement.  Note:  The  serial  number  for  a  Forced  Record  Alteration  output document  is  stored  on  the  Miscellaneous  Transaction  Summary  Record.  Do  not confuse  this  serial  number  with  the  normal  transaction  serial  number.  Systems documents  will  start  with  serial  number  0001  for  primary  gangs  and  5001  for secondary gangs. 5.6.4.3.4.2.  The  section  supervisor  must  submit  a  letter  fully  explaining  the reason for the difference, complete with support documents (copies of RPS/main site  console  outputs,  etc.).  (T-2).  Note:  It  is  important  that  Document  Control have as much information as possible to explain the discrepancy. 5.6.4.3.4.3.  The  Force  Record  Alteration  serial  number  will  be  reset  when  the end-of-year option of the Prep Inventory Accuracy Records Report is processed. The  date  in  the  document  number  will  indicate  the  date  the  AF  IT  System processed the input. 5.6.4.3.4.4.  When  a  complete  record  is  lost  and  must  be  reconstructed  on  the database,  use  the  applicable  inputs  to  reestablish  the  record.  For  example,  if  an item  record  is  lost,  use  a  FIL  input  to  reload  the  record;  use  an  inventory adjustment  input  to  establish  the  serviceable  balance  (if  applicable)  and  execute the Force Record Alteration to enter applicable data in other fields that cannot be entered with normal inputs. 5.6.5.  Query Language Processor (QLP) with Update. 5.6.5.1.  Purpose:  It is mandatory that all ERRORS should be corrected by processing a normal  input  or  a  series  of  inputs,  such  as  file  maintenance,  reverse-post,  or  inventory adjustments, in lieu of QLP with Update. Occasionally however, there will be conditions created  on  a  database  that  cannot  be  corrected  by  processing  normal  transactions  and Query Language Processor (QLP) with Update will be required. For other policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.6.5.2.  General Discussion: AFMC will provide the DISA OKC with a request letter of individuals authorized to process QLP with Update. 5.6.5.3.  QLP with Update. All QLP w/update transactions will be coordinated/approved by  AFMC.  AFMC  will  maintain  a  control  log  of  all  QLPs  with  update.  The  log  will contain  the  date;  serial  number;  reasons  for  use,  including  database/areas  affected;  who authorized  use;  names  of  personnel  using  the  program;  and  what  was  changed.  AFMC personnel  will  provide  the  electronic  copy  to  the  requesting/owning  account  for  filing through  their  website  https://private.amc.af.mil/635SCMG/CST/SCMGeFORCED RECORD  ALTERATION/.  The  Materiel  Management  Activity  will  process  the  hard copy  output  resulting  from  use  of  QLP  with  update  in  the  same  manner  as  a  Forced Record  Alteration  document,  annotated  with  the  information  from  the  control  log,  and filed in Document Control. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 289 5.6.5.4.  AFMC  will  take  all  output  from  this  process  and  follow  the  rules  of documenting and filing output required for Forced Record Alterations. A write once/read only  electronic  media  may  be  used  in  lieu  of  printed  output.  The  documentation  must state  why  Forced  Record  Alterations  or  other  inputs  could  not  be  used  to  modify  the records and approval official's name and rank. Document Control will file the output with the Consolidated Inventory Adjustment Document Register, M10/NGV836. 5.6.5.5.  Wing  and  MAJCOM  inspectors,  along  with  AF  Audit  personnel,  can  request from DISA OKC personnel a list of user-IDs, dates, and times that QLP with Update was invoked (by researching audit trail tapes and spooled master console data), to  provide a check of compliance with this instruction. Section 5G—Physical Inventory and Inventory Adjustments 5.7.  Physical Inventory and Inventory Adjustments. 5.7.1.  Establish and Distribute an Inventory Schedule. 5.7.1.1.  Purpose:  To  provide  an  inventory  schedule  by  fiscal  year  to  ensure  all  items assigned  a  warehouse  location  and/or  on  a  detail  record  are  inventoried  at  prescribed frequencies. For policy specific requirements and frequency review AFI 23-101, Sec. 5G. For  other  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.7.1.2.  The inventory schedule will ensure all commodities outlined in AFI 23-101 are schedule to not exceed required inventory frequency. Work with each warehouse/activity to create schedule which will be used to create the warehouse location validation. 5.7.1.3. The  following  actions  will  be  performed  to  establish  and  distribute  an  Inventory Schedule: 5.7.1.3.1.  To  be  efficient,  plan  inventories  carefully.  Determine  the  length  of  time and the number of items selected for inventory carefully so that normal LRS/Materiel Management Activity operations do not suffer. 5.7.1.3.2.  Physical  Inventory  Control  Section  establishes  an  inventory  schedule  by fiscal year. 5.7.1.3.3.  Prepare and publish an inventory count schedule using letter format. 5.7.1.3.4.  Establish an inventory deadline as the date on which the inventory begins. The balance on the computer record as of the deadline date is the balance with which the inventory count input balance is compared. 5.7.1.3.5.  Provide  copies  of  the  inventory  schedule  to  all  affected  sections/elements or flights. 5.7.1.3.5.1.  The  LRS  CC/AO  will  notify  supported  unit  commanders  of upcoming scheduled inventories. (T-1). 5.7.1.3.5.2.  EAE  functions  will  notify  the  appropriate  unit  equipment/SPRAM custodians  of  the  inventory  schedule  to  allow  proper  time  to  generate  necessary documents  and/or  listings,  resolve  discrepancies,  etc.  in  preparation  for  the inventory. (T-1). 290 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.7.2.  Preparing the warehouse for Inventory Count. 5.7.2.1.  Purpose:  Provide  guidance  on  preparing  the  warehouse  for  an  inventory  count.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use AFH 23-123. 5.7.2.2.  All actions applicable to the location scheduled for inventory must be processed at least 1 day before the inventory deadline date. 5.7.2.3.  Warehouse  personnel  accomplish  the  following  to  prepare  for  an  inventory count: 5.7.2.3.1.  Validate  the  warehouse  location  within  10  workdays  prior  to  the  date  the inventory is to begin. See Sec. 5C, of this manual for more information on procedures to conduct warehouse validations. 5.7.2.3.2.  Isolate and identify the area scheduled for inventory by clearly marking the parameters of the area with ropes, signs, etc. Signs marking off the area must state the inventory  deadline  date  so  warehouse  personnel  can  monitor  transactions  occurring before that date. 5.7.2.3.3.  Limit  movement  of  assets  in  the  areas  to  be  inventoried  to  emergency issues and to transactions occurring before the inventory deadline date. 5.7.2.3.3.1.  When property is  removed from  an  area under inventory on  or after the  inventory  deadline  date,  record  the  transactions  on  a  recap  sheet.  As  a minimum,  entries  on  the  recap  sheet  must  include  stock  number,  system designator,  quantity,  document  number,  appropriate  transaction  identification code, and warehouse location. 5.7.2.3.3.2.  Items  received  during  inventory  are  held  in  the  Inbound  Cargo  hold area if sufficient space is available. When not, the materiel, a copy of the receipt, and  a  copy  of  the  applicable  IT  system  notice  indicating  the  stock  number  is frozen for inventory will be held in the warehouse storage hold area. 5.7.3.  Complete Inventory Count Procedures. 5.7.3.1.  Purpose: To provide instructions for performing complete inventory counts. For policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use  AFH 23-123 or the ES-S User’s Manual 5.7.3.2.  CAUTION: The identification of a potential inventory variance (gain or loss) on a classified item constitutes a potential compromise of classified information and will be reported  immediately  upon  discovery  IAW  AFI  16-1404.  For  NWRM,  see  AFI  20-110 for additional reporting requirements. 5.7.3.3.  General  Procedures  for  Conducting  Complete  Inventory  Counts:  Steps  to prepare  the  warehouse  for  inventory  must  be  completed  before  the  inventory  count deadline date. 5.7.3.3.1.  Perform complete inventory counts using the closed warehouse-method of inventory.  See  AFI  23-101,  Ch  5  for  additional  information  on  closed  warehouse method. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 291 5.7.3.3.2.  The  Inventory  Management  function  in  ILS-S  will  be  used  to  record  and submit  inventory  counts  for  ILS-S  accounts.  Inventory  count  listings  (and  count images)  will  be  available  in  ILS-S  Inventory  Management  function  after  the applicable  inventory  parameter  is  processed  by  AFMC.  See  ES-S  User’s  Manual: https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-LGIL-  ES/default.aspx  for  instructions.  Note:  ILS-S system queries will not be used as the official tool to perform this function. 5.7.3.3.2.1.  Inventory  count  parameter  requests  for  ILS-S  accounts  will  be submitted to AFMC one day before the inventory count deadline date (See AFH 23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for  inventory  parameter  request  format).To  ensure frequency  requirements  are  met,  inventory  parameters  will  be  processed  once  a month with the Date of Last Inventory (DOLI) option. For example, two separate Inventory  Count  File  parameters  will  be  processed  for  in-warehouse  assets  that will become overdue in the schedule month: one to identify item records that will not  meet  the  365-day/annual  requirement  (e.g.,  consumables  and  recoverables) and  another  for  the  180-day/  semi-annual  requirements  (e.g.,  classified  and COMSEC).  Also,  DOLI  options  will  be  processed  to  identify  detail  records  that will  become  overdue  in  the  scheduled  month  (i.e.  Supply  Point,  Equipment, SPRAM,  WCDO,  MSK,  Special  Spares,  RSP,  Unserviceable  DIFM,  COMSEC and  SA/LW  Serialized  Details,  etc.).    Process  all  Item  and  detail  record inventories  through  ILS-S  so  DOLI’s  are  updated  within  inventory  frequencies outlined in AFI 23-101. 5.7.3.3.3.  Retrieve  the  Inventory  Count  Listing  from  ILS-S  Inventory  Management function. Count listings may be printed or downloaded to a handheld terminal (HHT). 5.7.3.3.4.  Physically count  and record the warehoused/in-use quantity for each item listed on the Inventory Count Listing. 5.7.3.3.5.  When  the  inventory  count  is  completed,  inventory  personnel  must  submit the  Physical  Count  Quantity  on  each  Inventory  Count  Record  through  ILS-S Inventory Management function for processing in the ILS-S (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for Inventory Count format). (T-1) 5.7.3.3.5.1.  When the count quantity and the item record/detail quantity are equal the IT system will update the Date of Last Inventory and remove inventory freeze codes. No further action is required. 5.7.3.3.5.2.  When  the  count  quantity  and  the  item  record/detail  quantity  are unequal the following actions are accomplished: 5.7.3.3.5.2.1.  The  IT  system  updates  the  applicable  inventory  accuracy record, creates a transaction history, and produces an inventory recount image. (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the inventory recount format). 5.7.3.3.5.2.2.  Physically  recount  the  inventory  materiel  in  the  location indicated on the inventory recount image and record the count balance. 5.7.3.3.5.2.3.  Update inventory recount images with the recount quantity and input into the appropriate material management IT system (AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the inventory recount format). 292 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.7.3.3.5.2.3.1.  AF  policy  allows  programmatic/automatic inventory adjustments for items meeting defined criteria (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for detailed automatic adjustment criteria). 5.7.3.3.5.2.3.2.  When  unequal  physical  inventory  recounts  do  not  qualify for  programmatic/automatic  adjustment,  additional  research  must  be conducted  (See  Researching  out-of-balance  Inventory  conditions  of  this section for complete research procedures and documentation requirements). 5.7.3.3.6.  Inventory count completion 5.7.3.3.6.1.  Review  Daily  Document  Registers  and  Transaction  Histories  to ensure all item movement recorded on recap sheets is processed immediately after count/recount  processing.  Recap  sheets  may  be  destroyed  after  verifying  all transactions are recorded in the appropriate material management IT system. 5.7.3.3.6.2.  Advise  applicable  elements/sections/flights  the  inventory  count  has been  completed  after  all  count/recount  records  and  subsequent  transactions  have been  processed.  When  the  last  inventory  count  transaction  for  an  inventory  is accepted,  an  Inventory  Completion  Notice  will  be  recorded  in  the  ILS-S  Audit Trail. Inventory Completion Notices are viewable by querying Transaction Name “ICN”  in  ILS-S  Audit  Trail.  Print  output  and  file  with  monthly  inventory adjustment listing. 5.7.3.3.7.  Complete Inventory Counts of Supply Points 5.7.3.3.7.1.  The  general  procedures  for  complete  inventory  recounts  apply  to supply point inventory recounts except as detailed below. 5.7.3.3.7.1.1.  Process Supply Point Listing (AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5) to  create  the  count  record  database  file.  Use  ILS-S  Inventory  Management function  to  print  a  list  of  count  images  for  supply  point  items  in  document number sequence or download the count images into a HHT. Inventory count personnel  advise  FSC  personnel  of  applicable  supply  points  undergoing inventory  count  to  ensure emergency issues/shipments are recorded on recap sheets. Note: ILS-S queries will not be used as the official tool to perform this function. 5.7.3.3.7.1.2.  Inventory  count  personnel  perform  the  physical  count  of  local supply  point  assets.  LRS  CC/AO  personnel  may  conduct  a  joint  inventory with  CCI/COMSEC  monitor.  All  other  supply  point  custodians  will  assist Inventory Count Personnel as required. 5.7.3.3.7.1.3.  Off-base  inventory  counts  are  conducted  in  the  same  way  as local  supply  point  inventory  counts,  except  that  Inventory  Count  Personnel send  only  the  inventory  count  listing  to  the  supervisor  of  the  supply  point. Inventory Count  Personnel  retains  the  remainder of the Supply  Point  Listing and  appropriate  Issues  and  Inquiries  until  the  inventory  count  has  been completed.  The  supply  point  supervisor  is  responsible  for  conducting  the inventory count and for returning the listing to Inventory Count Personnel. For satellite  accounts,  the  inputs  are  returned  to  satellite  Inventory  Count AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 293 Personnel.  Note:  When  the  annual  inventory  count  is  to  be  conducted  at  the same time as the reconciliation, the Supply Point Listing will be distributed by the supply point monitor within the FSC. 5.7.3.3.7.1.4.  Inventory  Count  Personnel  processes  inventory  recount  inputs for supply points through the ILS-S Inventory Management function. Satellite account  supply  point  inventory  recounts  are  input  by  satellite  account Inventory Count Personnel 5.7.3.3.7.1.5.  Inventory Count Personnel can reconstruct lost count or recount inputs by obtaining the required data from the count listing. 5.7.3.3.8.  Complete Inventory Counts of MSK/MRSP Assets 5.7.3.3.8.1.  The  general  procedures  for  complete  inventory  recounts  apply  to MSK/MRSP inventory  recounts except  as detailed below. Note: For recoverable and consumable MSK/MRSP items, the item records are not frozen during annual inventories 5.7.3.3.8.2.  For  receipt  of  an  MRSP  transferred  or  loaned  from  another  unit; conduct an inventory IAW AFI 23-101 Table 5.5. 5.7.3.3.8.3.  Inventory  counts  for  off  base  (non-deployed)  MSK/MRSP  may  be conducted by managing unit. LRS CC/AO has the option to send inventory count personnel to the off-base location if warranted. 5.7.3.3.8.3.1.  The managing unit signs and forward listing to LRS. Inventory personnel will update DOLI accordingly. 5.7.3.3.8.3.2.  Listing will be filed in Document Control IAW AFRIMS. 5.7.3.3.9.  Complete Inventory Counts of WCDO/IRSP Assets. 5.7.3.3.9.1.  The  general  procedures  for  complete  inventory  recounts  apply  to WCDO/IRSP asset inventory recounts except as detailed below. 5.7.3.3.9.2.  WCDO/IRSP  items  collocated  with  normal  retail  warehouse  stock. When  WCDO/IRSP  spares  are  stored  in  the  same  bin  location  as  normal  retail stock  and  DO  NOT  have  an  RSP  warehouse  location  assigned,  conduct  the inventory by doing the following: 5.7.3.3.9.2.1.  Process Inventory Count Listing (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch  6)  and  use  ILS-S  Inventory  Management  function  to  print  a list  of  count images or download the count images into a HHT. 5.7.3.3.9.3.  Segregated  WCDO/IRSP  spares.  When  WCDO/IRSP  spares  are stored  separately  from  normal  retail  stock,  and  a  RSP  warehouse  location  is assigned, conduct the inventory by doing the following: 5.7.3.3.9.3.1.  Process WCDO list using the inventory select option (AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6). 5.7.3.3.9.3.2.

Use  ILS-S  Inventory  Management  function  to  print  a  list  of count images or download the count images into a HHT. 5.7.3.3.9.4.  MAJCOMs  authorized  IRSP  will  ensure  local  inventory  procedures are developed and coordinated with the storing activity when these assets are not stored in the LRS CC/AO storage facility. Inventory Count Personnel provides the storing activity with  an  annual  inventory  count  schedule. The inventory  count  is jointly  accomplished  by  personnel  from  Inventory  Count  Personnel  and  the storing activity. 5.7.3.3.10.  Complete Inventory Counts of Sensitive, CCI/COMSEC in the warehouse and/or on MRSP. 5.7.3.3.10.1.  The  general  procedures CCI/COMSEC MRSP inventory recounts except as detailed below. for  complete inventory  apply to 5.7.3.3.10.2.  In  addition  to  scheduling  inventories,  Inventory  Count  Personnel submits  the  applicable  inventory  parameter  to  AFMC  and  takes  the  following actions: 5.7.3.3.10.2.1.  Advise the applicable custodian of the inventory count date so all transactions can be recorded on a recap sheet. 5.7.3.3.10.2.2.  Obtain the required inventory count list from ILS-S Inventory Management  function.  Send  the  MRSP  custodian  the  inventory  count  list. Note:  ILS-S  queries  will  not  be  used  as  the  official  tool  to  perform  this function. 5.7.3.3.10.3.  RSP  personnel  will  perform  a100%  physical  inventory  count  by serial number. (T-1). Specifically, physically verify the serial number on the item to the serial number on inventory list; enter the quantity on hand on the inventory count list, and return to Inventory Count Personnel for immediate processing. 5.7.3.3.10.4.  Overage/Shortage of CCI/COMSEC. If the physical inventory count does  not  agree  with  the  supply  system  inventory  balances,  an  inventory  recount image is produced.. 5.7.3.3.10.4.1.  Inventory  Count  Personnel  must  notify  the  LRS  CC/AO,  the CCI/COMSEC  custodian,  and  the  organization  commander  of  a  possible overage/shortage of CCI/COMSEC. (T-1). 5.7.3.3.10.4.2.  Inventory  Count  Personnel  will  assist  the  RSP  personnel  in performing  the  required  research  (for  additional  information  on  research  see Researching  Out-Of-Balance  Inventory  Conditions).  (T-2).  Note:  For equipment items, coordinate with EAE for additional research and corrective actions. 5.7.3.3.10.4.3.  If the cause of the overage/shortage cannot be determined, the LRS CC/AO and/or organization commander notifies the appropriate security manager  to  initiate  an  inquiry  into  the  probable  compromise.  Process  the probable compromise IAW DoDM 5100.76, V3, AFI 16-1404, and AFMAN 23-220.  Note:  The  CCI/COMSEC  custodian  /  equipment  custodian  is responsible  for  any  additional  reporting  actions  (see  AFMAN  33-283, AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 295 Communications  Security  (COMSEC),  Operations  for  additional  information on CCI/COMSEC materiel). 5.7.3.3.11.  Conduct  complete  inventory  counts  of  BEAR  Unit  Type  Codes  (UTC upon return from a deployment. 5.7.3.3.12.  When the annual inventory count schedule is completed, Inventory Count personnel prepares an inventory parameter request using the DOLI option (See AFH 23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  to  detect  and  produce  inventory  count  outputs  for  item records  that  contain  a  warehouse  location  or  serviceable  balance  but  have  not  been inventoried  in  the  past  365  days  or  in  the  last  180  days  for  sensitive  and  classified items. 5.7.4.  Special Inventory Count Procedures. 5.7.4.1.  Purpose:  To  provide  instructions  for  performing  special  inventory  counts  to reconcile  out-of-balance  conditions  discovered  during  other  than  complete  inventory counts. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123 or the ES-S User’s Manual. 5.7.4.2.  Caution: The identification of a potential inventory variance (gain or loss) on a classified  constitutes  a  potential  compromise  of  classified  information  and  will  be reported immediately upon discovery IAW AFI 16-1404. For NWRM items, see AFI 20-110 for additional reporting instructions. 5.7.4.3.  Conducting  Special  Inventory  Counts:  The  following  paragraphs  explain generalized  procedures  for  requesting  and  conducting  special  inventory  counts.  If  an inventory  functional  section/element  does  not  exist  at  satellite  accounts,  the  host  base performs  the  special  inventory.  Note:  Special  inventory  counts  do  not  satisfy  the requirement for complete inventories. 5.7.4.3.1.  Special Inventory Interrogations are required for: 5.7.4.3.1.1.  Insufficient  Balance.  When  an  insufficient  balance  exists  for  a degraded  ops  transaction,  item  condition  code  changes,  or  identity  changes,  the appropriate  Material  Management  IT  System  will  programmatically  freeze  the item record. Inventory Count Personnel will receive the degraded ops transaction reject and the special inventory request. 5.7.4.3.1.2.  Warehouse the warehouse/stockroom  supervisor  will  process  the  special  inventory  request  and forward the output notice to Inventory Count Personnel. warehouse refusals, Refusal. For 5.7.4.3.1.3.  Other. Inventory Count Personnel are required to process the request for other special inventory requirements. 5.7.4.3.2.  Process a Special Inventory Interrogation Input (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,  Ch  5  to  freeze  the  item  record  and/or  details  with  freeze  code  “I”  and  produce  a Special  Inventory  Count  Output  Notice  (see  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5) containing  pertinent  asset,  detail,  and  history  information.  Transactions  that  do  not affect the serviceable balance of a frozen item record will be allowed to process. 296 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.7.4.3.3.  Inventory Count Personnel will manage a Special Inventory Suspense file. (T-2). 5.7.4.3.3.1.  Retain  the  suspense  file  copy  of  the  Special  Inventory  Interrogation Inputs and/or reject notices. Automated files will be used in lieu of paper. 5.7.4.3.3.2.  After  the  inventory  count  is  complete,  pull  the  suspense  copy  for distribution. Return a copy of the annotated Special Inventory Interrogation Input to  the  requesting  activity.  If  an  automated  file  is  used,  notify  the  requester  and delete the record. 5.7.4.3.3.3.  Destroy the suspense copy for policy-directed special inventories (ex: control item change or critical item code change). 5.7.4.3.4.  Count  the  items  in  the  bin  location  reflected  on  the  Special  Inventory Count Output Notice (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5). 5.7.4.3.5.  When the item count is equal to the quantity indicated in the output notice, process  a Special Inventory  Input transaction using the format provided in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. Note: When a TEX Code is in the input, it appears on the M10 Consolidated Inventory Adjustment Document Register for the management review. 5.7.4.3.6.  When  the  item  count  is  not  equal  to  the  quantity  indicated  in  the  output notice, conduct research to determine the cause and appropriate actions to correct the out-of  balance  condition.  See  this  section  for  details  about  how  to  conduct  the research.  NOTE:  Research  in  not  required  for  items  meeting  automatic  adjustment criteria IAW AFI 23-101. 5.7.4.3.7.  When  the  research  is  complete  and  corrective  actions  have  been  taken, process an inventory recount input using the format provided in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 5.7.4.4.  Special Inventory Procedures for Selected Conditions. The following paragraphs detail additional special inventory count procedures as they apply to specific conditions. 5.7.4.4.1.  Warehouse Refusals or Insufficient Balance Rejects. 5.7.4.4.1.1.  When Inventory Count Personnel receive warehouse refusals without a Special Inventory Output Notice (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) attached, they  should  prepare  and  process  a  Special  Inventory  Interrogation  Input,  TEX code “P” (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) for the item(s). 5.7.4.4.1.1.1.  Distribution of Warehouse Refusal Documents. The distribution of  warehouse  refusal  documents  depends  upon  the  outcome  of  the  special inventory count. 5.7.4.4.1.1.2.  Assets Not Found. If Inventory Count Personnel cannot find the assets associated with the warehouse refusal, distribute the related documents as follows: 5.7.4.4.1.1.3.  Issue  Documents  (to  include  Bench  Stock  Issues).  Distribute issue  documents  as  follows:  copy  1  to  Document  Control;  copy  2  to  Input source; copy 3 to Organization; copy 4 to the FSC. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 297 5.7.4.4.1.1.4.  Shipping  Documents.  Distribute  shipping  documents  as follows: copy 1 to Document Control; copy 2 to Input source; all other copies will be destroyed 5.7.4.4.1.1.5.  Reverse-Post  Document.  Forward  the  copy  of  the  reverse-post document  (DD  Form  1348-1A)  to  Bench  Stock  Support,  so  that  the  master bench stock format will be re-input. 5.7.4.4.1.1.6.  Assets  Found.  If  Inventory  Count  Personnel  find  asset(s) associated  with  the  warehouse  refusal,  return  the  documentation  to  Storage personnel for action. 5.7.4.4.1.2.  For  insufficient  rejects  without  a  Special  Inventory  Output  Notice, prepare and process a Special Inventory Interrogation Input (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5). 5.7.4.4.2.  Controlled  Item  Code Changes. When a controlled item  code is upgraded and the item record has a serviceable balance or a warehouse location, the item record will be frozen for a special inventory count.  Special  Inventory  count  images will be systematically  created  when  controlled  item  code  changes  occur  and  detail  records have an on-hand balance exist. 5.7.4.4.2.1.  Inventory count images for DIFM details are created when the DIFM status flag equals zero and for unserviceable details when the first six positions of the document number equals R920RW. 5.7.4.4.2.2.  Unserviceable  Asset  Special the Unserviceable Detail List section of the Repair Cycle Asset Management List to perform the inventory of unserviceable detail assets. Inventory  Counts.  Use 5.7.4.4.2.3.  Notify  Personnel.  When  counting  out-of-warehouse  assets  (DIFM, supply  point,  etc.),  Inventory  Count  personnel  notify  the  personnel  who  are counting  the  materiel  of  the  new  controlled  item  code,  so  that  adequate  security measures are taken. 5.7.4.4.3.  Unserviceable  Asset  Overage.  Take  the  following  actions  if  the  special inventory count result indicates an unserviceable asset overage exists: 5.7.4.4.3.1.  Unserviceable DIFM item: 5.7.4.4.3.1.1.  Overage Found--Unserviceable Detail Already Loaded. If there is an overage and an unserviceable detail is loaded for the stock number, use Special  Inventory  Input  (see AFH 23-123,  Vol 2, Pt  1, Ch 5) to  increase the detail balance. 5.7.4.4.3.1.2.  Overage  Found--Unserviceable  Detail  Not  Loaded.  Pick  up supply items by processing an Special Inventory Input (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) with TEX code L (found on base) followed by a condition code change (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5). 5.7.4.4.3.2.  Unserviceable  Equipment  Items.  Inventory  works  with  EAE  to determine if the previous user caused the overage by forwarding a return item to the  unserviceable  warehouse  location  without  processing  the  TIN  input.  Note: 298 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 when  dealing  with  overage  of  a  serialized  control  item,  contact  the  applicable Item Manger with the actual serial number of the asset. The Item Manager will be able  to  tell  you  who  the  last  owner  of  the  asset  was,  by  organization  and  shop code,  and  SRAN.  Never  process  an  FOB  TIN  on  a  serialized  control (CCI/COMSEC/weapon) asset. 5.7.4.4.3.2.1.  Previous  User  Known.  When  the  previous  using  organization can  be  determined,  process  a  P  or  E  activity  code  return  (whichever  is appropriate)  using  their  organization  code.  This  records  the  unserviceable detail and updates the authorized/in-use detail record if appropriate. 5.7.4.4.3.2.2.  Previous  User  Unknown.  When  assets  cannot  be  traced  to  a previous  user,  process  a  serviceable  Special  Inventory  Input  (see  AFH  23-123,Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5)  with  TEX  code  L  followed  by  a  Condition  Code Change  (see  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5).  This  action  establishes  an unserviceable detail record. 5.7.4.4.4.  Unserviceable  Shortages.  When  there  is  a  shortage,  process  a  Special Inventory  Input  (see  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5)  to  decrease  and/or  delete  the unserviceable  detail  record.  Notify  FSC  Personnel  of  all  transactions  affecting unserviceable  detail  records to  ensure  reporting,  control,  and  shipment  of unserviceable assets. 5.7.4.4.5.  Identity  Changes.  When  recorded  assets  or  item  records  require  identity changes, Inventory Count Personnel will work with Inspection and Storage personnel to provide the data necessary for proper validation and corrective action according to Sec. 5I. 5.7.4.4.6.  Problematic warehouse location changes. 5.7.4.4.6.1.  Inventory  Count  Personnel  screen  the  file  maintenance  transactions (activity  code  Y)  on  Daily  Document  Resisters  to  ensure  newly  assigned warehouse locations are valid. When new locations are not valid, Inventory Count Personnel initiates special inventory count procedures to verify the locations and quantities on hand. 5.7.4.4.6.2.  When  the  items  are  not  located,  inventory  adjustments  will  be processed in accordance with this section. 5.7.4.4.6.3.  When  locations  are  determined  to  be  valid,  update  the  inventory schedule to ensure locations are included in normal inventory cycle. 5.7.4.4.7.  Misidentified  Serialized  Control  CCI/COMSEC  Items.  When  special inventory  procedures  are  used  to  re-identify  serialized  control  CCI/COMSEC  items ensure the following occurs: 5.7.4.4.7.1.  Process a return to decrease the Authorized-In-Use-Detail record for the losing stock number. 5.7.4.4.7.1.1.  Process  a  Special  Inventory  Interrogation  Input  (see  AFH  23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) to freeze the stock number on the losing in use detail record. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 299 5.7.4.4.7.1.2.  Process a COMSEC/CCI Serialized Control Input-Format Two. Use type phrase IADDTL. 5.7.4.4.7.1.3.  Process  a  Special  Inventory  Input  to  decrease  the  in  use quantity on the losing in use detail record. 5.7.4.4.7.2.  Increase  the  Authorized  In  Use  Detail  record  for  the  gaining  stock number. 5.7.4.4.7.2.1.  Process  a  Special  Inventory  Interrogation  Input  (see  AFH  23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) to freeze the stock number on the gaining in use detail record. 5.7.4.4.7.2.2.  Process  COMSEC/CCI  Serialized  Control  Input-Format  Two. Use the type phrase IADDTL. 5.7.4.4.7.2.3.  Process a Special Inventory Input to increase the in use quantity on the gaining in use detail record. 5.7.5.  Researching Out-Of-Balance Inventory Conditions. 5.7.5.1.  Purpose:  Provide  procedures inventory  out-of-balance conditions. For additional information on research requirements, accounting adjustments, and  determining  cause,  see  AFI  23-101,  Sec.  5G,  DoDR  7000.14-R,  DoD  Financial Management  Regulation,  Vol  12,  Ch  7,  and  AFPD  65-1,  Management  of  Financial Services.  For  other  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific guidance use AFH 23-123. researching for 5.7.5.2.  Caution: The identification of a potential inventory variance (gain or loss) on a classified  or  NWRM  constitutes  a  potential  compromise  of  classified  information  and will  be  reported  immediately  upon  discovery  IAW  AFI  16-1404.  For  NWRM,  see  AFI 20-110 for additional reporting instructions. 5.7.5.3.  General  research  requirements  associated  with  specific  inventory  deficiencies. Research  begins  with  the  current  date  and  continues  back  either  one  year,  to  the  last inventory  adjustment,  or  the  previous  DOLI.  Research  is  not  mandatory  for  automatic adjustments (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for Automatic Adjustment Criteria). 5.7.5.3.1.  Research  all  variances,  including  DIFM  balances,  before  input  of  the recount  to  determine  cause  and/or  correct  the  following  accountable  processing errors: 5.7.5.3.1.1.  Review the Consolidated Transaction History  Inquiry Report to find erroneous transactions. 5.7.5.3.1.2.  Account  for  transactions  that  may  not  have  been  posted.  Review unprocessed  backlog  including  warehouse  recap  sheets,  the  daily/cumulative reject  listing,  and  the  receiving  line  for  assets  that  have  not  been  forwarded  to Central Storage. 5.7.5.3.1.3.  Review  Serviceable  Balance  with  no  Location  function  (see  ES-S User’s  Manual)  to  determine  if  a  different  warehouse  location  was  assigned. Correct warehouse location errors. 300 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.7.5.3.1.4.  Review  IT  audit  trail  file  to  determine  if  a  notice  to  stock  is  on  file with a warehouse location. 5.7.5.3.1.5.  Review  emergency  issues  made  during  complete  inventory  count  to ensure  all  physical  movement  of  materiel  in  and  out  of  the  storage  bin  was properly recorded. 5.7.5.3.1.6.  Do  any  additional  research  required  to  review  locally  established processes. 5.7.5.3.2.  After  research,  correct  the  discrepancies  via  the  following  actions  as appropriate: 5.7.5.3.2.1.  Complete  a  Record  Reversal  to  correct  erroneous  transactions detected during research for resolved discrepancies. 5.7.5.3.2.2.  Advise  Central  Storage  or  the  warehousing  activity  for  other  type accounts and satellites to move the property to the correct location or to process a warehouse location change. 5.7.5.3.2.3.  Process  backlog documents by other applicable sections or flights for resolved discrepancies. include  corrected/rejected transactions that 5.7.5.3.2.4.  Adjust  the  count  or  recount  quantity  for  unresolved  discrepancies. Then reprocess the count or recount image. 5.7.5.4.  Document  research  actions  (including  discrepancies  and  corrective  action)  and file this document in Document Control as a supporting document. MAJCOM determines the format and data required. 5.7.5.5.  When initial  research does not  identify the probable cause(s) of inventory loss, further  research  may  be  required.  See  AFI  23-101  Sec.  5G,  and  AFMAN  23-220  for additional guidance. 5.7.5.5.1.  Further  research  is  conducted  by  a  person  not  supervised  by  the accountable or responsible officer. 5.7.5.5.2.  The results of the investigation or ROS will be documented on DD Form 200. 5.7.5.6.  Investigating  Discrepant  DLADS  Shipments/Transfers. Intransit  control procedures are an additional control for discrepant DLADS shipments or transfers. They do not affect inventory adjustment procedures and criteria. Use the inventory procedures below to investigate and process Disposal Follow-Up from DLADS. 5.7.5.6.1.  When Document Control forwards a copy of the Disposal Follow-Up from DLADS  to  Inventory,  perform  a  special  inventory  to  determine  why  a  quantity variance exists between the quantity shipped/transferred to the DLADS Location and the  quantity  reported  to  the  DLADS.  Complete  the  special  inventory  and  return  the Disposal Follow-Up from DLADS to Document Control within ten days. 5.7.5.6.2.  Inventory  Personnel  determines  if  the  property  was  removed  from  the warehouse and delivered to the DLADS Location or if the property was transferred to AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 301 Cargo  Movement  for  shipment  to  the  DLADS  Location.  If  the  property  is  located, Inventory ensures it is promptly delivered or transferred to the DLADS Location. 5.7.5.6.3.  If  the  property  is  not  located  and  you  suspect  theft  or  fraud  is  the  reason property is not in the warehouse or at DLADS Location, document these findings and present them to the Operations Officer. The Operations Officer reviews the findings and  if  warranted,  initiates  a  request  for  criminal  investigation  according  to  AFI  90-301,  The  Inspector  General  Complaints  Resolution.  If  the  DLADS  Location  never received the shipment/transfer, enter an L in position 44 and enter zeros in pos. 25-29. 5.7.6.  DIFM Inventory Procedures. 5.7.6.1.  Purpose:  To  provide  instructions  for  performing  DIFM  inventory  counts.  For policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use  AFH 23-123 or the ES-S User’s Manual. 5.7.6.2.  Caution: The identification of a potential inventory variance (gain or loss) on a classified  or  NWRM  constitutes  a  potential  compromise  of  classified  information  and will  be  reported  immediately  upon  discovery  IAW  AFI  16-1404.  For  NWRM,  see  AFI 20-110 for additional reporting instructions. 5.7.6.3.  Conducting  DIFM  Inventory  Counts:  DIFM  Reconciliations  satisfy the requirement  to  inventory  out-of-warehouse  recoverable  items.  When  discrepancies  are discovered between DIFM record balances and the physical count, FSC requests a special inventory by processing a Special Inventory Interrogation Input (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5). 5.7.6.3.1.  Special Inventory Counts of DIFM Items. Conduct the following steps for resolving variances in DIFM inventory 5.7.6.3.1.1.  Perform a physical count. 5.7.6.3.1.2.  Conduct research for all special inventory counts as described in this chapter. 5.7.6.3.2.  If  research  confirms  adjustment  or  records  reversal/correction  is  not required, do the following: 5.7.6.3.2.1.  Process a Special Inventory Input (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) with the item record serviceable balance or the detail balance in the inventory count to remove the freeze code. 5.7.6.3.2.2.  When  records  reversal  and  correction  is  required  to  resolve  the discrepancy, take the following action: 5.7.6.3.2.2.1.  Prepare  and  process  reverse-post  and/or  other  transactions  as required (see Sec. 5E, of this manual). 5.7.6.3.2.2.2.  When  applicable,  forward  warehouse  refusal  documents  to Central Storage to release materiel for customer equipment. 5.7.6.3.2.2.3.  Annotate  the  Special  Inventory  Interrogation  Input  notice  with the action taken. Use this notice to clear the freeze code suspense file. 5.7.6.3.3.  When adjustments are required, do the following: 302 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.7.6.3.3.1.  Input  Special  Inventory  Input  (see  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5). Enter the stock number, system designator, count quantity (leading zeros are not required), and TEX code, if applicable. The document number and research date fields will be required if the suspense image is for a DIFM detail inventory count. 5.7.6.3.3.2.  If required, prepare reverse-post transactions. 5.7.6.3.3.3.  Annotate  the  Special  Inventory  Interrogation  Input  notice  with  the corrective action. Keep the notice in suspense until the adjustment appears on the document register. Use this notice to clear the freeze code suspense file. 5.7.6.3.4.  The following special instructions apply for unserviceable assets found on base: 5.7.6.3.4.1.  If an asset does not seem to belong to an existing detail, 5.7.6.3.4.1.1.  Input Special Inventory Input (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5) TEX L to pick it up on the item record serviceable balance. 5.7.6.3.4.1.2.  Process a condition change request to establish an unserviceable detail, and transfer the assets. 5.7.6.3.4.2.  If  the  item  is  unserviceable  and  belongs  to  an  existing  detail,  use normal processing. For serialized controlled items, create the serial number record (in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  10)  with  the  phrase  IADITM  (inventory adjustment item). 5.7.7.  Equipment Inventory Counts. 5.7.7.1.  Purpose: Provide procedures for completing inventory counts of in-use/in place equipment.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.7.7.2.  CAUTION: The identification of a potential inventory variance (gain or loss) on a classified or NWRM constitutes a potential compromise of  classified information  and will  be  reported  immediately  upon  discovery  IAW  AFI  16-1404.  For  NWRM,  see  AFI 20-110 for additional reporting instructions. The following actions are to be performed by the LRS/Materiel Management Activity/unit equipment custodians: 5.7.7.3.  General  Procedures  for  performing  inventory  on  In-Use/In-Place  Equipment items.  Equipment  Custodians  are  responsible  for  performing  a  complete  physical inventory  of  equipment  recorded  on  unit’s  Custodian  Authorization/  Custody  Receipt Listing  (CA/CRL).  Organizational  commanders/staff  agency  director  can  formally request  inventory  count  assistance  from  the  LRS  CC/AO.  Request  must  include  full justification and identify discrepancies involved. 5.7.7.3.1.  EAE  utilizes  the  on-line  AF  Form  1991  or  equivalent  to  submit  an Inventory  Parameter  to  AFMC  (see  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for  parameter request  format).  Note:  Material  Management  IT  system  queries  will  not  be  used  as the official tool to perform this function. 5.7.7.3.1.1.  EAE  "may"  also  process  EIC  transactions  directly  to  update equipment detail DOLI. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 303 5.7.7.3.2.  EAE  retrieves  CA/CRL  and  Labels,  if  requested,  no  later  than  the beginning  of  the  next  workday.  Forward  to  equipment  custodian  or  to  Inventory Count Personnel when requests for inventory count assistance are been granted by the LRS CC/AO. 5.7.7.3.3.  Conduct physical inventory count and manually record count quantities on the CA/CRL. 5.7.7.3.4.  Custodians  must  sign  the  CA/CRL  to  acknowledge  responsibility  for property. (T-1). 5.7.7.3.4.1.  Inventory  Count  Personnel  will  sign  under  the  custodian’s  signature when  providing  inventory  count  assistance.  When  using  the  ES-S  database  to store  the  CA/CRL,  after  the  commander  has  digitally  signed  and  uploaded  the CA/CRL,  the  EAE  will  open  the  current  stored  CA/CRL,  print  it,  and  have  the Inventory  Count  Personnel  print/sign  and  date  under  the  custodian’s  signature. The EAE will then scan the Inventory Count Personnel’s signed CA/CRL into a pdf file and upload into ES-S. (T-1). 5.7.7.3.4.2.  Custodians prepares and sign an Inventory Overage Document for all overages  found  during  inventory  (see  AF  Form  2005,  Inventory  Overage Document (TRIC: IOD), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5). 5.7.7.3.4.2.1.  When  an  AF  Form  601  is  required,  attach  to  the  inventory overage document. 5.7.7.3.5.  Custodians  must  research  appropriate  supporting  documentation  (hand receipts, affidavits, statements, certificates, etc.) and initiate Reports of Survey (ROS) as necessary. (T-1). 5.7.7.3.6.  Forward  a  copy  of  the  CA/CRL  and  any  supporting  documentation  for overages/shortages  to  EAE.  Inventory  Count  Personnel  must  validate  equipment overages/shortages before adjusting the in-use detail. 5.7.7.3.7.  EAE  personnel  submit  the  physical  count  quantities  through  the  ILS-S  to complete inventory processing and update applicable system records. 5.7.7.4.  Conducting Special Inventory Counts of Equipment. 5.7.7.4.1.  Inventory  Count  Personnel  will  use  special  inventory  procedures  (see Special Inventory Count Procedures of this section) for overages/shortages custodians report to EAE. (T-1). 5.7.7.4.1.1.  The  following  process  is  to  be  performed  if  inventory  recount  and research show an equipment overage exists: 5.7.7.4.1.1.1.  Obtain/prepare  an  Inventory  Overage  Document  (AF  Form 2005) with the custodian’s signature. 5.7.7.4.1.1.2.

When  ownership  remains  undetermined,  contact  the  CEMO  for assistance. 5.7.8.5.  Inventory  Adjustments  of  SA/LW.  If  a  verified  overage/shortage  exists,  see Weapons Serialized Control Input (Format Two) as outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch  10  for  serialized  control  processing  that  must  accompany  inventory  adjustment procedures. 5.7.9.  NWRM Inventory Procedures. 5.7.9.1.  Purpose:  To  describe  the  general  procedures  associated  with  conducting Semiannual  NWRM  Worldwide  Inventory  (WWI)  and  inventories  required  when  the NWRM  Accountable  Officer  (NWRMAO)  changes.  Additional  information,  including appointment/certification  of  NWRM  inventory  team,  can  be  found  in  AFI  20-110.  For other  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use AFH 23-123. 5.7.9.2.  A  complete  physical  count  of  NWRM  by  serial  number  and/or  Unique  Item Identification (UII) will be conducted semiannually and/or upon change of NWRMAO to obtain  agreement  between  the  physical  on-hand  NWRM  balances  and  the  accountable record balance. NWRM inventories validate the existence and completeness of 100% of the  NWRM.  Existence  indicates  items  selected  from  the  Accountable  Property  Systems of  Record  (APSR)  (i.e.  SBSS,  CAS,  DSS,  etc.)  are  physically  inspected.  Completeness indicates all assets are accounted for in the APSR. 5.7.9.2.1.  The  change  of  NWRMAOs  requires  a  100%  inventory  to  support  the effective  date  of  transfer.  For  the  accounting  of  all  NWRM,  the  losing  NWRMAO will direct a 100% inventory of NWRM. This inventory will be validated (reviewed AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 307 with the inventory officer (IO), ref. NWRMAO and AFI 20-110) by both the losing and  gaining  NWRMAOs  to  certify  a  joint  100%  inventory  as  of  the  effective accountability  transfer  date.  See  Sec.  1B,  for  Change  of  NWRMAO  procedures. Note: Semiannual inventories can be used to suffice for the requirement for a change of  NWRMAO  provided  both  gaining  and  losing  individuals  approve  the  inventory and no transactions affecting stock record balances occur between the end date of the inventory and the effective date of the transfer of accountability. 5.7.9.2.2.  AF activities will conduct the NWRM inventory during the same month of the installation’s nuclear weapons Semiannual Inventory Report (SIR) IAW TP 100-3150, Joint Reporting Structure; Nuclear Weapons Reports. (T-0). 5.7.9.2.3.  AF  activities  that  do  not  conduct  a  SIR,  will  conduct  the  NWRM semiannual  inventory  in  the  months  of  March  and  September  or  April  and  October. (T-1). 5.7.9.2.4.  NWRM will be inventoried according to the policies prescribed in AFI 20-110 and the procedures in this section. (T-1). 5.7.9.2.5.  CAS  managed  NWRM  will  use  CAS  procedures  found  in  AFI  21-201, Munitions  Management.  (T-1).  Note:  Out-of-cycle  inventory  counts  do  not  satisfy semiannual complete inventory requirements. The LRS CC/AO may elect to conduct an annual inventory count for any class or type of asset other than controlled assets, to include NWRM. 5.7.9.2.6.  Due  to  information  system  constraints  and  to  ensure  schedules  and deliveries  are  not  impacted,  it  is  up  to  the  respective  organization  to  determine  if items need to be frozen within the repair cycle for proper count during the inventory period. 5.7.9.2.7.  NWRM  installed  on-weapon  systems  (e.g.  missiles,  aircraft)  will  not  be inventoried. 5.7.9.3.  Roles and Responsibilities for Semiannual Inventory. 5.7.9.3.1.  HQ  AFMC:  Directs  and  manages  the  semiannual  NWRM  world-wide inventory on every NWRM with an on-hand balance in materiel management APSR to include all detail/custody balances. 5.7.9.3.1.1.  Provides specific dates for the stop movement and freeze of NWRM.  The  inventory  freeze  will  take  place  during  a  two  week  period  in  the  months  of March  and  September  or  April  and  October  for  executing  the  inventory  (except AF activities with a SIR, who follow TP 100-3150). The inventory freeze will be lifted after all units have completed their physical count. 5.7.9.3.1.2.  All  materiel  management  APSR  NWRM  items  will  be  frozen  for inventory.  The  NWRM  Transaction  Control  Cell  (NTCC)  manages  inventory freeze codes and updates the Date of Last Inventory (DOLI) after the inventory is complete. 5.7.9.3.1.3.  Identifies  a  POC  to  provide  NWRM  information  to  the  MAJCOMs and  consolidates  all  NWRM  inventory  results  forwarded  to  HQ  AFMC  thru MAJCOMs. 308 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.7.9.3.1.4.  Provides  each  MAJCOM  POC  with  an  inventory  spreadsheet containing  NWRM  items  for  their  bases/units  for  use  in  accomplishing  the inventory process. 5.7.9.3.1.5.  Creates official world-wide inventory data pull listing and establishes the inventory data cut-off date as of the date of the data pull. 5.7.9.3.1.6.  Provide  discrepancies  requiring  inventory  adjustment  to  AF/A4L NLT 1 Jan for the previous year’s semi-annual inventories. 5.7.9.3.2.  MAJCOM NWRM POCs (recommend 0-6 or GS-15): 5.7.9.3.2.1.  Assigns an NWRM WWI POC and provides the POC information to AFMC inventory POC and affected bases. 5.7.9.3.2.2.  Ensures  distribution  of  NWRM  WWI  Semi-annual inventory timeline,  any  additional  inventory  instructions,  and  inventory  spreadsheets  to  all units under their respective control. Note: The inventory spreadsheet is the official inventory record. 5.7.9.3.2.3.  Performs  quality  check  on  unit  submitted  inventory  documentation and consolidates into a MAJCOM inventory package. When complete, forward all inventory  package  to  AFMC  NWRM  Inventory  POC  IAW  AFI  20-110.  Note: documentation  package  will  also  include  any  inventory  related  adjustment discrepancy research. 5.7.9.3.3.  The NWRMAO: 5.7.9.3.3.1.  Reviews  the  inventory  data  spreadsheet  provided  by  AFMC  to validate  locations,  baseline  quantities  or  volume  to  determine  number  of  teams required to perform inventories in the allotted inventory period. 5.7.9.3.3.2.  Assembles  the  inventory  team(s)  coordinating  with  appropriate organizations and assign inventory area of responsibility. 5.7.9.3.3.3.  Appoints  an  IO  in  writing  and  select  additional  team  members  to assist with inventory as required. 5.7.9.3.3.4.  The inventory team members must be identified no later than (NLT) seven days prior to  the start  of the inventory to allow time to  arrange  for  access into the secured areas. 5.7.9.3.3.5.  The Inventory Team will be comprised of the following individuals: an  IO  with  materiel  management  experience  and  a  verifying  individual.  The organizational  equipment  custodian  will  be  required  to  support  the  inventory  of assets  on  in-use  details.  The  team  may  be  further  supported  with  additional personnel  to  facilitate  the  inventory  (moving  property,  unpackaging  and repackaging assets, etc.). Maintenance/munitions SMEs will assist in determining special  asset  handling  requirements.  (See  AFI  20-110  for  additional  information on inventory teams). 5.7.9.3.3.6.  Coordinate  with  the  respective  area  being  inventoried  to  provide special  instructions  for  access,  safety,  electro-static  discharge  (ESD)  prevention, and other required information. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 309 5.7.9.3.3.7.  Schedule the times and locations for the inventory teams (where to go and when). 5.7.9.3.3.8.  Ensure  all  inventory  team  members  are  authorized  to  enter  all locations where NWRM are stored. 5.7.9.3.3.9.  Brief the inventory team on the details and procedures of conducting a ‘blind inventory.’ 5.7.9.3.3.10.  Use the inventory spreadsheet and current APRS data to identify all locations where NWRM is stored. Note: The inventory spreadsheet(s) will not be used  to  perform  the  inventory;  it  will  be  used  to  reconcile  the  results  after  the inventory is complete. 5.7.9.3.3.11.  Create blind inventory count cards for each NWRM NSN using the Excel  template  provided  (for  an  example,  see  NWRM  Inventory  Count  Card Template, AFH 23-123,Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5). Only the NSN and location/facility will be filled in. 5.7.9.3.3.11.1.  NWRM  Storage  Facility  (NSF)  may  use  DSS-generated products. 5.7.9.3.3.12.

Initiates causative research for all inventory discrepancies. 5.7.9.3.5.  The verifying individual: 5.7.9.3.5.1.  Accomplishes  an  audit  of  account  in  conjunction  with  the  NWRM 310 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 inventory. See AFI 20-110 for audit of account procedures. 5.7.9.4.  NWRM Smart-Book (if utilized). 5.7.9.4.1.  The use of a Smart-Book is a local option although not required, its use is highly encouraged. If utilized, care must be taken to ensure the information contained in  the  Smart-Book  does  not  contain  or  become  “classified”  in  nature.  Each organization  with  NWRM  may  generate  an  NWRM  Smart-Book  to  help  familiarize the  inventory  team  with  their  organization’s  NWRM.  If  utilized,  at  a  minimum  the Smart-Book shall contain: 5.7.9.4.2.  Official  NWRM  NSN  list  with  all  NWRM  NSNs  highlighted  which  the organization does and/or could possess. 5.7.9.4.3.  Consolidated  list  of  potential  NWRM  with  list  of  locations  within  the organization where the item could be found (known as the NWRM footprint). 5.7.9.4.4.  Each NWRM item listing will consist of the following: 5.7.9.4.5.  NSN. 5.7.9.4.6.  Part Number(s). 5.7.9.4.7.  Applicable Resource Control Center (RCC)/Production Section Scheduling Designator (PSSD). 5.7.9.4.8.  Delivery location(s). 5.7.9.4.9.  Storage location(s), including the AWP area. 5.7.9.4.10.  Maintenance location(s), where work is performed on the item. 5.7.9.4.11.  Month/Year of last time the organization had one or more of these items. 5.7.9.4.12.  A  picture  or  drawing  of  each  NWRM,  including  information  on  the location of the data plate. 5.7.9.5.  The  following  actions  are  general  procedures  for  NWRM  Semi-annual Inventories: 5.7.9.5.1.  In order to validate the existence of NWRM, the inventory will be a blind inventory, meaning the inventory officers will be provided a count card with an NSN and location but will not be given the serial number or the number of assets on record. 5.7.9.5.2.  A  complete  physical  inventory  of  NWRM,  by  S/N,  will  be  conducted  on every  NWRM  with  an  on-hand  balance  in  the  accountable  materiel  management systems  to  include  all  detail  balances,  assets  tracked  by  spreadsheets,  or  any  assets that are not  on an accountable materiel  management system (e.g. trainers, mockups, simulators, test stands, displays). 5.7.9.5.2.1.  The  inventory  team  will  be  taken  to  the  respective  area  by  escorts from the organization where the inventory is to take place to physically inventory all NWRM they find in the area. 5.7.9.5.2.2.  These inventory locations will be searched for NWRM that may have been misplaced to include those areas where NWRM has recently been stored or maintained. The objective is to perform a general sweep of these locations, not a AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 311 “wall-to-wall” search, to find all NWRM. 5.7.9.5.3.  All NWRM will be visually verified (except when properly packaged and marked  per  AFI  20-110)  and  counted  by  serial  number.  The  blind  inventory  count card  will  be  filled  out  using  asset  information  from  the  asset  itself  or  the  exterior packaging/tag if the asset is banded, crated, and/or sealed. The objective is to ensure 100% accountability of all NWRM. inspect the individual  both  visually items 5.7.9.5.4.  The  IO  and  verifying identification  information  for  each  asset  or  container.  The  maintenance/munitions SME  ensures  the  correct  serial  number  is  identified  for  assets  that  contain subcomponents  (e.g.  Aft  Section).  The  IO  will  records  the  required  information  on the blind inventory count card and the verifying individual reviews the information to ensure 100% accuracy. It is essential that serial numbers are accurately transcribed (to include any preceding zeros) to the blind inventory count cards during the inventory. Note:  Care must be taken to ensure the information recorded on the blind inventory count card is legible. 5.7.9.5.5.  When the data plate does not have all of the information needed to identify the asset (e.g. data plate is missing the NSN), or the item is contained in a sealed box, use  the  accompanying  documentation  (e.g.  Work  Control  Document  (WCD),  DD Form  1577  or  DD  Form  1348-1A,  Issue  Release/Receipt  Document)  to  get  the required information for the count card. If the documentation conflicts, then note all variations of numbers on the count card using subsequent lines with '#' column set the same for any one item pending research after the completion of the inventory. 5.7.9.5.5.1.  When unable to determine the identity of an asset, contact the NTCC for assistance. 5.7.9.5.6.  Inventory of installed assets on accountable records. 5.7.9.5.6.1.  NWRM  will  not  be  disassembled  for  the  sole  purpose  of  serial number (SN) verification. 5.7.9.5.6.2.  These  assets  will  be  inventoried  by  records  check.  The  NWRMAO will  create  a  new  blind  inventory  count  card  for  each  NSN  for  NWRM  that  are inventoried via a records check. 5.7.9.5.6.3.  The  IO  and  verifying  individual  will  complete  the  blind  inventory count card using data from the accountable system and will annotate, inventoried by records check, in the remarks section of the count card. 5.7.9.5.6.4.  When  transcribing  the  blind  inventory  count  card  data  to  the inventory spreadsheet, annotate in the comments section the next higher assembly (NHA) the asset is installed in (e.g. Trainer, Mockup, Simulator, test stand). 5.7.9.5.7.  After the inventory is complete, perform inventory reconciliation IAW the process in this manual. 5.7.9.6.  Inventory Count Cards 312 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.7.9.6.1.  The  IO  will  document  each  NWRM  inventoried  on  their  inventory  count cards. Each line on the count card will only contain one item (i.e. Qty is  1). Special care will be taken to ensure all leading zeros are included in SNs. 5.7.9.6.2.  When corrections are made, line out incorrect information and initial next to the line out. 5.7.9.6.3.  When  all  assets  have  been  inventoried  and  the  count  card  has  remaining lines, draw a diagonal line through all unused rows and write “No Further Entries” on the line. 5.7.9.6.4.  Additional  detailed  instructions  for  filling  out  the  count  card  (NWRM Inventory Count Card) form are provided with the official form. 5.7.9.6.5.  Once  the  inventory  is  complete,  close  the  inventory  by  assigning  page numbers (1 of 8, etc.) to the blind inventory count cards. Blind inventory count cards used  during  the  inventory  must  be  signed  and  dated  by  both  the  IO  and  verifying individual. 5.7.9.6.6.  NWRMAO will collect all materiel given to the inventory teams. 5.7.9.7.  Movement of assets during semiannual inventory. 5.7.9.7.1.  Movement  of  assets  must  be  curtailed  prior  to  the  inventory  to  clear  the transportation channels and ensure that most, if not all, assets are accounted for in a system  of  record.  To  facilitate  this  effort,  outbound  shipments  will  be  stopped  two weeks  prior  to  the  start  of  the  inventory.  Internal  base-level  or  depot-level  asset movements (receipts, issues, due-out releases, returns) will continue through the day prior to the data pull for the inventory (ensure returns are processed to unserviceable details). 5.7.9.7.2.  The  Cargo  Movement  will  also  stop  all  outbound  shipments  two  weeks prior  to  the  start  of  the  inventory.  (T-2).  They  will  make  every  effort  to  ensure  all assets processed for shipment are shipped prior to  this deadline. After the data pull, asset movements are restricted at all locations, with the exceptions noted below, until inventory  actions  are  completed  across  the  AF  and  NTCC  has  lifted  the  inventory freeze and normal activity can resume. 5.7.9.7.3.  Exceptions to asset movement restrictions: 5.7.9.7.3.1.  MICAPs:  MICAP  requirements  for  assets  with  available  stock  on hand will be satisfied using manual degraded operations issue procedures (Asset Management will not be used). MICAP requirements for assets with no stock on-hand  will  be  requisitioned  off-line  and  receipted/due-out  released  using  manual degraded  operations  procedures  (Asset  Management  will  not  be  used).  All transactions will be recorded on recap sheets for subsequent processing when the freeze  is  lifted.  The  NWRMAO  is  responsible  for  ensuring  all  degraded operations  transactions  are  processed  correctly  and  record  balances,  serial numbers, etc. match assets on-hand. 5.7.9.7.3.2.  Internal  base-level  asset  movements  (REC,  ISU,  MSI,  DOR,  TIN) will continue through the day prior to the data pull for the inventory. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 313 5.7.9.7.3.3.  Inventory  requirements  for  record  balance  gains  (receipts,  returns) resulting from the above transactions: Assets will be inventoried using procedures above  (general  procedures  for  NWRM  Semi-annual  Inventories)  and  the following additional guidance. A new blind inventory count card will be created by  the  NWRMAO  and  completed  by  the  inventory  team.  Enter  explanation  of record  balance  gain  in  the  remarks  field  of  the  blind  inventory  count  card  (i.e. MICAP  REC,  Doc  #  FBXXXX91969001).  These  additional  assets  will  not  be counted when processing Inventory Recount (IRCs) transaction to complete ILS-S  inventory  processing.  Asset  information  from  the  blind  inventory  count  cards will be transferred to the appropriate columns of the inventory spreadsheet using the  first  blank  line  at  the  bottom  of  the  inventory  spreadsheet.  Enter  specific explanation  for  addition  in  the  remarks  column  (i.e.  MGS  receipt,  Doc  # FBXXXX91960001). 5.7.9.7.3.4.  Inventory  requirements  for  record  balance  losses  (issues,  due-out releases, shipments) resulting from the above transactions: Enter  explanation for movement  of  asset  in  the  remarks  column  of  inventory  spreadsheet  for  each specific  serial  number  involved  (i.e.  MICAP  MSI,  Doc  #  S0050191960001). These assets will be counted when processing IRCs to complete ILS-S inventory processing, since they were on record at the beginning of the inventory period. 5.7.9.8.  Inventory Procedures for Assets in Cargo Movement. 5.7.9.8.1.  Inventory Management will inventory assets that have been processed for shipment  but  were  not  physically  shipped  by  the  Cargo  Movement  prior  to  the shipping deadline per guidance above. The NWRMAO will identify NWRM assets in the Cargo Movement and create a new blind inventory count card for each NSN. The IO will complete the blind inventory count card and enter In-transit Cargo Movement and  the  shipment  document  number  in  the  remarks  column.  (T-2).  These  additional assets  will  not  be  counted  when  processing  IRCs  to  complete  ILS-S  inventory processing. Asset information from the blind inventory count cards will be transferred to  the  appropriate  columns  of  the  inventory  spreadsheet  using  the  first  blank  line  at the  bottom  of  the  spreadsheet.  Enter  In-transit  Cargo  Movement  and  the  shipment document number in the comments column. 5.7.9.9.  Inventory  of  Assets  in  Base  Level  Maintenance.  Installed  NWRM  not  on  the Accountable  Property  System  of  Record  (APSR)  are  not  subject  to  NWRM  inventory. Reference AFI 20-110, Ch 8. Note: If NWRM items are already disassembled, they will not be counted, but the SN/part number (PN) should be captured. The remarks section of the inventory count card should clearly identify these items as sub-assemblies of the end item they are a part of. Ensure local procedures are developed to identify NWRM assets disassembled  for  on-going  maintenance  actions  to  prevent  duplication  of  count  by inventory teams. 5.7.9.10.  Planning  and  Performing  Inventories  in  AF  NWRM  Storage  Facilities  (NSF). These  procedures  outline  the  process  to  accomplish  the  semi-annual  world-wide inventory  of  NWRM  in  Distribution  Standard  System  (DSS)  accounts.    The  NSF  is  a wholesale NWRM node and will not follow standard retail inventory procedures, specific procedures are in Physical Counting in the NWRM Storage Facility (NSF). 314 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.7.9.10.1.  The  Acceptable  Performance  Level  (APL)  for  physical  inventories  of NWRM  is  100  percent.  This  means  that  there  will  be  zero  difference  between  the physical count and record balances. 5.7.9.10.2.  Unique  Item  Identification  (UII)  numbers  (synonymous  with  serial number)  must  be  verified  manually  during  the  physical  count  process  as  DSS  does not inventory by UII. A DSS PE4Y-02 Inventory Workload By Work Area document will  be  utilized  in  the  verification  process  of  the  location  count  for  each  physical inventory (See Figure 5.2). A second, modified, Query Management Facility (QMF) Count Sheet will be used to inventory counts and record the UII/serial numbers (See Figure 5.3). This product will not contain pre-printed UII/serial numbers. 5.7.9.10.3.  All inventories of NWRM are completed by physically counting the stock unless  Automated  Information  Technology  (AIT)  radio  frequency  identification (RFID) inventory is performed at MAJCOM discretion. A paper count (recording the on-hand  balance  from  the  Quantity  By  Location  record)  IS  NOT  an  acceptable practice. 5.7.9.10.4.  Physical  counts  will  be  performed  by  a  two  person  (IO  and  verifying individual) dual count verification process. 5.7.9.10.4.1.  When  a  second  or  third  count  of  a  location  is  required,  different individuals  will  perform  the  count.  Example:  Persons  conducting  the  first  count should  not  conduct  the  second  or  third  count.  (Second  count  is  generated  as  a result of a first count variance. Third count is the result of a variance between the first and second counts.) 5.7.9.10.4.2.  A  bare  item  inspection  is  not  required  for  banded,  crated,  and/or sealed  items  that  show  no  sign  of  tampering.  Conduct  a  bare  item  inspection  to verify the NSN, UII, Condition Code, Unit of Issue and quantity. (If opening the container  will  compromise  the  condition  of  the  materiel,  do  not  perform  the inspection.) 5.7.9.10.5.  Procedures must be established to ensure the NWRM inventory includes or meets the following: 5.7.9.10.5.1.  Schedule inventories. 5.7.9.10.5.2.  Monitor scheduling to ensure effective management of work. 5.7.9.10.5.3.  Complete  NWRM  inventories  within  two  weeks  of  workload release. 5.7.9.10.5.4.  Provide  NTCC  with  verification  that  all  NWRM  NSNs  at  the  site have been inventoried. 5.7.9.10.5.5.  Track and report performance to the NSF NWRMAO. 5.7.9.10.5.6.  Report  problems  completing  any  of  the  Type  Physical  Inventory Codes (TPIC) G inventories to the NWRMAO. 5.7.9.10.5.7.  Coordinate  the  availability  of  an  Equipment  Specialist  (ES)  as required in performance of a bare item inspection/physical count. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 315 5.7.9.10.5.8.  Notify  the  NWRMAO  within  one  hour  after  discovery  of  potential inventory loss or gain of NWRM. 5.7.9.10.5.9.  Have  all  potential  adjustments  reviewed  by  the  NWRMAO. Causative research for all adjustments requires approval at the Flag Officer/Senior Executive Service level. 5.7.9.10.5.10.  Conduct  rapid  assessment  research  for  all  potential  gains  and losses and report findings to the NWRMAO. 5.7.9.10.5.11.  TPIC.  NWRM  item  inventories  will  be  assigned  a  TPIC  of  G through the Complete Inventory Group Program in DSS. 5.7.9.10.5.12.  Report  inventories  of  any  NSN  not  completed,  in  writing,  to  the NWRMAO. The report should contain an explanation of the reason the inventory is incomplete. 5.7.9.10.5.12.1.  Catalog  data  changes  and  condition  code  changes automatically cancel the TPIC G inventory in DSS. If this occurs, reschedule the  cancelled  inventory  and  complete  within  the  original  two-week  period. (DSS  CA  Dispatch  report  PE4X  (ADD  INVENTORY  CANCELLATION) will be generated daily and may be reviewed to identify cancelled inventories due to cataloging or condition code changes.). 5.7.9.10.5.12.2.  If  a  rescheduled  inventory  cannot  be  completed  within  the original  two-week  period,  permission  to  extend  the  completion  date  must  be obtained from AFMC Cataloging Activity. 5.7.9.10.6.  NWRM Inventory Scheduling Procedures in DSS 5.7.9.10.6.1.  Use  the  PS03  (LOCAL  STRATA  INPUT/REVIEW)  screen  to  add an  inventory  request.  Type  Physical  Inventory  Code  “G”,  Warehouse  Area,  and Narrative (title for inventory) must be entered. 5.7.9.10.6.1.1.  After  adding  inventory  request,  confirm  release  of  the inventory (PS031 screen, LOCAL STRATA SELECTIONS). 5.7.9.10.6.1.2.  The  complete  inventory  program  will  run  behind  the  scenes and  populate  the  stratum.  The  inventory  must  be  reviewed  and  accepted before it will release into production. 5.7.9.10.6.2.  Access  the  PS11  (BROWSE  OPEN  SAMPLE  INVENTORIES) screen to  locate and browse (or delete) the inventory that was created.  DSS will display the PS16 (COMPLETE INVENTORY REVIEW/ACCEPT) screen, where the inventory may be accepted or deleted. The applicable Inventory Cut-Off Date (ICOD) must be entered prior to accepting the inventory. 5.7.9.10.6.2.1.  The  inventories  will  load  into  the  workload  bank  and subsequently release into the workload when end-of-day wrap-up runs on the assigned ICOD. 5.7.9.10.6.3.  Verify the group inventory was accepted by browsing the applicable group (BROWSE  OPEN  SAMPLE INVENTORIES)  screen.  DSS  will  display  the  PS13  (DISPLAY  IN-PROCESS the  blank  PS11 ID  number  on 316 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 RESULTS) screen showing the inventories were loaded into the workload bank. 5.7.9.10.6.4.  Print  the  DSS  PE4Y-02,  Inventory  Workload  By  Work  Area document for use in the inventory. (Figure 5.2). 5.7.9.10.7.  Physical Counting in the NWRM Storage Facility (NSF) 5.7.9.10.7.1.  For  assets  stored  in  the  NSF,  one  count  team  member  will possess the  DSS  PE4Y-02  (Figure  5.2)  and  the  other  will  use  the  modified  QMF  count sheets containing SRAN, NSN, and Location (Figure 5.3). The IO and Verifying Individual will proceed location-by-location to stored material, “both will” verify NSN, UII/serial number, Condition Code, Unit of Issue and quantity contained on the  DD  Form  1500-Series  tag  and  verify  corresponding  information  on  the  DSS documents.  The  “Physical  Quantity”  total  for  each  location  will  be  recorded  on the  DSS  PE4Y-02  and  each  “UII/Serial  Number”  and  “Total  Location  Count Quantity” will be recorded on the modified QMF count sheet. 5.7.9.10.7.2.  During the inventory, annotate the following: 5.7.9.10.7.2.1.  Total Quantity. 5.7.9.10.7.2.2.  Serial Number/UII (Synonymous). 5.7.9.10.7.2.3.  Condition Code. 5.7.9.10.7.2.4.  Document  Number  (If  an  asset  is  in-transit  or  is  not  on  the data pull). 5.7.9.10.7.2.5.  Use the Remarks block to annotate any discrepancies or other notes of interest. 5.7.9.10.7.2.6.  IO and VI prints name, organization, phone number, dates, and signs  in  respective  blocks.  Note:  SRAN  need  not  be  filled  out  on  the  Blind Count Cards. 5.7.9.10.7.3.  After  the  inventory  documents  (DSS  PE4Y-02  and  modified  QMF count sheets) are annotated, the IO and Verifying Individual  will turn them over to  the  NWRMAO  who  will  reconcile  the  counts  of  the  DSS  PE4Y-02  (Figure 5.2)  against  the  modified  DSS  count  sheets  (Figure  5.3).  The  NWRMAO  will then  verify  the  UII/serial  numbers  on  the  DSS  count  sheets  against  the  AFMC provided data pull. 5.7.9.10.7.3.1.  When the counts reconcile, the counts will be input into DSS (PE3H  screen,  ENTER  INVENTORY  COUNTS)  by  a  qualified  NSF  DSS user. 5.7.9.10.7.3.2.  When  the  counts  do  not  reconcile,  a  different  inventory  team will  be  dispatched  to  the  location  where  the  discrepancy  exists  to  perform  a second count. If that second count reconciles, the count will be input into DSS (PE3H screen). 5.7.9.10.7.3.3.  When  the  second  count  does  not  reconcile,  the  NWRMAO will accompany the inventory team to the location and determine the cause of the discrepancy and resolution. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 317 5.7.9.10.7.3.3.1.  Counts  that  cannot  be  reconciled  will  be  processed  IAW AFI  20-110  procedures  for  causative  research  and  potential  inventory adjustment. 5.7.9.11.  Inventories in Depot Organic Maintenance. 5.7.9.11.1.  These  procedures  outline  the  process  to  accomplish  the  world-wide inventory of NWRM items in depot organic maintenance. 5.7.9.11.2.  Maintenance Wing (MXW) personnel will inventory NWRM within their respective wing. 5.7.9.11.3.  The  AFMC  Aerospace  Maintenance  and  Regeneration  Activity  does  not have any NWRM in repair and these procedures do not address any NWRM assets on an  aircraft/end-item  currently  in  storage  at  AFMC  Aerospace  Maintenance  and Regeneration Activity. 5.7.9.11.4.  For locations using multiple inventory teams, ensure local procedures are developed  to  identify  NWRM  disassembled  for  on-going  maintenance  actions  in order  to  prevent  duplication  of  count  by  inventory  teams.  Teams  are  highly encouraged  to  coordinate  the  performance  of  inventories  to  avoid  duplication  in counts. 5.7.9.11.5.  NWRM  that  has  been  removed  from  a  NHA  as  part  of  an  on-going maintenance action are subject  to  inventory. These items  will be captured on a new inventory  count  card  and  the  remarks  section  of  the  count  card  will  clearly  identify these items as sub-assemblies of their associated NHA. 5.7.9.11.5.1.  Research  will  be  conducted  to  determine  the  status  of  these  items e.g. to be reinstalled in the NHA or it is no longer required and will be turned in, demilitarized,  etc.  These  assets  will  be  added  to  the  inventory  spreadsheet following the last entry under a heading “Part of Ongoing Maintenance Action.” The  status  of  these  assets  (e.g.  reinstalled  in  NHA,  turned  in)  will  be  clearly identified  in  the  comments  section  of  the  inventory  spreadsheet  for  that  item. These are not considered overages. 5.7.9.11.6.  NWRM  that  are  issued  to  a  work  order  for  repair  of  an  NWRM  NHA. These  assets  will  be  documented  on  a  new  inventory  count  card  and  the  remarks section  of  the  count  card  will  clearly  identify  these  items  as  sub-assemblies  of  the NHA they are a part of to include the work order number. These items will be added to the inventory spreadsheet with a comment stating these items will be installed in a NHA to include the work order number. 5.7.9.11.7.  All maintenance holding areas (courtesy stores) will be inventoried, NHA only. 5.7.9.11.8.  Items  in  the  maintenance  repair  organization  (MRO)  will  not  be  frozen for this inventory. 5.7.9.11.9.  Inventory  data  will  consist  of  physical  location,  SOS,  NSN,  Condition Code, Serial Number, and an on-hand accountable balance. 318 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.7.9.11.10.  Researching  an  out-of-balance  scenario.  Each  situation  may  be  unique, but there are common circumstances that could cause an out-of-balance scenario. 5.7.9.11.10.1.

The  NWRMAO  will  continue  causative  research,  if  required,  and forward AFMC Form 37 to the IM for adjustment action. 5.7.9.11.14.  Inventory adjustments and ROS will be passed to the IM for processing. 5.7.9.11.15.  The IM will coordinate with AFMC Item Manger (RIM) to process any adjustments. 5.7.9.12.  Planning and Performing Inventories in Contractor Facilities. 5.7.9.12.1.  Close and early coordination between the NWRMAO, AFNWC Program Offices,  IM,  Production  Management  Specialist  (PMS),  ALC  Contracting  (PK),  the Defense  Contract  Management  Agency  (DCMA)  and  AFMC.  NTCC  is  essential  to ensure  full  understanding  and  cooperation  from  all  involved  parties  to  include  the contractors possessing Government owned NWRM at their facilities. 5.7.9.12.2.  NWRMAO: AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 319 5.7.9.12.2.1.  Assigns  an  IO  that  has  a  basic  understanding  of  the  items  to  be inventoried. 5.7.9.12.2.2.  Provides  the  IO  blind  inventory  count  cards  that  contain  the  NSN and location of NWRM as well as an inventory spreadsheet sealed in an envelope that is to be used during the reconciliation. 5.7.9.12.2.3.  Coordinates with the contracting officer (CO) at least 30 days prior to the inventory, to notify the contractor that the inventory will be taking place. 5.7.9.12.2.4.  Instructs contractors to stop movement of assets and freeze assets as well  as  reduce  transaction  processing  to  mission  essential  transactions  to  align with  the  inventory  freeze  dates  provided  by  AFMC.  The  contractor  will  provide the inventory team documentation of all transactions processed after the data pull upon arrival at the contractor’s facility. 5.7.9.12.3.  PMS (AFNWC) works with  the  IM to  ensure the inventory  team  has all the necessary information/data to facilitate a successful inventory. 5.7.9.12.4.  CO: 5.7.9.12.4.1.  Acts  as  a liaison  to  the  contractor to ensure full understanding  and compliance with the inventory requirements. 5.7.9.12.4.2.  Ascertains  if  special  access/security  clearances  are  required  for access to contractor facilities. 5.7.9.12.4.3.  Coordinates  specific  dates  for  the  inventory  and  forward  a  formal written notification to the contractor. 5.7.9.12.4.4.  Contact DCMA for inventory support as necessary. 5.7.9.12.5.  The  IO  is  responsible  for  planning  the  inventory,  conducting  the inventory,  performing  the  inventory  reconciliation  and  conducting  any  causative research  at  the  contractor  facilities  where  the  inventory  took  place,  and  report inventory results as prescribed by AFMC in this document. 5.7.9.12.5.1.  Ask the contractor if they are aware of other AF owned NWRM at their facilities. These assets will be inventoried IAW AFI 20-110 and this manual. 5.7.9.12.6.  The V/DO is responsible to perform the inventory along with the IO. 5.7.9.12.6.1.  Be familiar with AF inventory procedures. 5.7.9.12.7.  Program  Manager is  responsible to  coordinate with  the CO to ensure  all contracts include the necessary contract language outlining the requirements for semi-annual 100% NWRM inventories. 5.7.9.12.8.  At larger contractor locations where a DCMA representative is assigned, DCMA may act as a liaison between the contractor and the inventory team to verify the contractor’s stated location of previously un-located items. At contractor facilities where  no  DCMA  representative  is  assigned,  the  regional  DCMA  office  acts  in  an advisory capacity providing assistance where practical. 5.7.9.13.  Reconciling Inventories. 320 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.7.9.13.1.  Serial number validation. Since NWRM are serialized, it is essential that serial  numbers  from  the  blind  inventory  count  cards  are  verified  against  the accountable  record  to  ensure  100%  accountability.  Asset  identification  info  (NSN, serial number, condition code) from the blind inventory count cards will be validated against  both  the  AFMC  provided  inventory  spreadsheet  and  the  system  accountable record  to  ensure  all  data  matches.  If  there  is  a  discrepancy,  research  must  be conducted to resolve the error. 5.7.9.13.2.  Completion of the inventory spreadsheet. Blind inventory count card data for assets on record will be transferred (electronically) to the inventory spreadsheet in the  appropriate  columns  to  the  right  of  the  pre-existing  data.  Blind  inventory  count card data for assets gained (receipts, returns) or in the Cargo Movement will be added in the first blank line at the bottom of the inventory spreadsheet. Ensure explanations for  record  balance  loss  asset  movements  are  recorded  in  the  comments  column  for each specific serial number. 5.7.9.13.3.  If  physical  count  does  not  match  accountable  records  and  inventory spreadsheet,  research  must  be  performed  IAW  researching  inventory  discrepancy procedures in this section and full supporting documentation provided (IAW AFI 20-110, Ch 11). 5.7.9.14.  Researching Inventory Discrepancies. 5.7.9.14.1.  The NWRMAO must research, identify, and correct, or initiate action to resolve,  the  cause  of  all  inventory  discrepancies.  (T-1).  If  the  input  inventory  count does  not  match  the  accountable  records  balance,  a  physical  recount  is  required  to validate  the  initial  count.  The  inventory  team  will  recount  the  item  using  the procedures  in  this  document  and  record  the  results  on  new  inventory  count  card(s). The  NWRMAO  will  then  use  the  NWRM  inventory  count  card(s)  and  inventory spreadsheet to reconcile the inventory to the accountable record. (T-1). 5.7.9.14.2.  If the recount does not resolve the discrepancy, pre-adjustment research is required.  Pre-adjustment  research  is  performed  to  verify  that  the  system  balance  is correct. The NWRMAO will perform a complete review of all transactions to include supporting  documents  and  catalog  changes, shipping  discrepancies  and unposted/rejected  documentation  since  the  last  inventory  in  order  to  validate  the system  balance  and  determine  if  a  discrepancy  between  that  balance  and  the  count exists.  (T-1).  If  a  potential  loss  cannot  be  resolved  within  24  hours,  a  Report  of Survey will be initiated and provided to the IM. Pre-adjustment research is complete when  the  system  balance  is  verified  to  be  correct  or  the  adjustment  quantity  is determined. 5.7.9.14.3.  If upon completion of pre-adjustment research, an inventory adjustment is required,  the  IM,  the  NTCC,  and  MAJCOM  A4R  must  be  notified  within  24  hours and  provide  inventory  adjustment  documentation  for  IM  approval.  The  inventory adjustment  documentation  must  be  certified  by  the  NWRMAO  and  approved  by his/her  appointing  official  (Wing/CC)  per  in  AFI  20-110.  IMs  must  obtain  approval from the first Flag Officer/Senior Executive Service level in their chain of command prior  to  performing  or  authorizing  the  inventory  adjustment  transaction.  The AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 321 adjustment  that  results  will  change  the  system  balance  to  match  the  final  definitive count. 5.7.9.14.4.  Causative research must be performed on all discrepancies, resolved and unresolved, identified as a result of the inventory. The purpose of causative research is  to  identify  the  root  cause  of  any  inventory  discrepancy.  The  NWRMAO  has  30 days to complete causative research and provide the results to the IM, the NTCC, and MAJCOM A4R. 5.7.9.14.4.1.  A  resolved  discrepancy  is  any  discrepancy  that  is  correctable  by (re)processing a transaction to correct the system balance (thus bringing count in line with  balance). An unresolved discrepancy is  any discrepancy that cannot  be corrected by (re)processing a transaction to correct the system balance. 5.7.9.15.  Analyzing and Reporting Inventories. 5.7.9.15.1.  The  NWRMAO  or  MASO  of  units  participating  in  the  semi-annual NWRM  World  Wide  Inventory  (WWI)  will  submit  the  following  products  to  their respective MAJCOM NWRM POC: (T-1). 5.7.9.15.1.1.  A  Certificate  of  Inventory  signed  by  the  NWRMAO  or  MASO, Inventory Officer and the Verifying official. (T-1) 5.7.9.15.1.2.  An  Inventory  sheet  signed  and  dated  by  the  Inventory  Officer  and Verifying  Individual  reflecting  the  final  counts.  Note:  All  discrepancies  will  be identified (loses or gains, and inventory mismatches). (T-1). 5.7.9.15.2.  MAJCOM  POCs  will  quality  check/review  unit  submitted  inventory documentation.  Consolidate  information  and  submit  an  inventory  documentation package to NTCC within 30 calendar days after the last day of inventory. 5.7.9.15.2.1.  A  certificate  of  Inventory  signed  by  the  NWRMAO  or  MASO, Inventory Officer and the Verifying Individual. 5.7.9.15.2.2.  An  Inventory  sheet  signed  and  dated  by  the  Inventory  Officer  and the Verifying Individual reflecting the final counts. NOTE: All discrepancies will be  identified  (losses,  gains,  and  inventory  mismatches).  Inventory  sheets submitted  by  NWRMAOs  and  MASOs  must  include  MAJCOM  A4R  and  A4W (or equivalent) signatures acknowledging the inventory review and the results of their respective units. (T-1). 5.7.9.15.3.  When  out  of  balance  condition  was  discovered  during  inventory,  the NTCC will remove the 'N' freeze code via NWRM Freeze Code Load or Delete (see AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5)  and  submit  a  Special  Inventory  Interrogation  (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5). 5.7.9.15.4.  The  NTCC  will  update  the  DOLIs  upon  proper  notification  from  the owing  MAJCOM  indicating  inventory  completion  at  their  individual  units.  Note: DOLI processing will not occur for NSNs at the unit until AFI 20-110 Discrepancy or ROS processing is complete. 5.7.9.15.5.  NTCC  will  provide  discrepancies  requiring  inventory  adjustment  to AF/A4L NLT 1 Jan for the previous year semi-annual inventories. 322 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Figure 5.2.

Purpose:  To  provide  instructions  to  adjust  the  accountable  balance  for unresolved  discrepancies  when  there  is  a  difference  between  the  quantity  of  assets  on hand  and  the  quantity  shown  in  the  accountable  balance.  For  IT  specific  guidance  use AFH 23-123 or the ES-S User’s Manual. 5.7.10.2.  Caution: The identification of a potential inventory variance (gain or loss) on a classified  item  constitutes  a  potential  compromise  of  classified  information  and  will  be reported immediately upon discovery IAW AFI 16-1404. See AFI 20-110 for additional reporting requirements for NWRM. 5.7.10.3.  Inventory  variances  are  discovered  during  Complete  or  Special  inventories  or upon the processing of a Special Inventory Input (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5). 5.7.10.4.  Processing  a  Special  Inventory  Input  may  create  both  a  decrease  and  an increase  inventory  adjustment  record.  These  adjustments  appear  as  separate  entities  on the Consolidated Inventory Adjustment Document Register 5.7.10.5.  Adjustment Documentation 5.7.10.5.1.  Adjustments  research  will  be  documented  using  AF  Form  12,  Supply Inventory Research Worksheet 5.7.10.5.1.1.  AF  Form  12  is  used  to  provide  justification  and  authentication  for the adjustment of the physical inventory and accounting records. AF Form 12 will be signed by the certifying and approval officials prior to processing adjustment. 5.7.10.5.1.2.  The  certifying  official  will  be  the  person  who  performed  the inventory  research  or  lead  researcher  if  team  performed  the  research.  The approving  official  will  be  the  Material  Management  Flight  Superintendent/OIC.  The  certification  signature  certifies  information  on  the  AF  Form  12  as  accurate and all applicable research was conducted. Note: Adjustments for NWRM require more stringent research and approval authority IAW this manual. 5.7.10.5.1.3.  Once  adjustment  is  processed,  the  IAD  document  number  and transaction number will be annotated  on the AF  Form 12 and form  will  be filed with the M10 along with all supporting documentation. 5.7.10.5.2.  Supporting documentation for organizational supplies and equipment: 5.7.10.5.2.1.  Organizational supplies and equipment encompass any items stored and managed outside of LRS, i.e. Equipment/SPRAM, DIFM, RSP, Supply Point, etc. 5.7.10.5.2.2.  For losses that do not meet ROS criteria, organizational commander will  draft  a  memorandum  summarizing  research  conducted,  suspected  cause  of variance,  and  corrective  actions to  prevent  further  reoccurrence. Memorandum will be attached to AF Form 12 as supporting documentation. taken Section 5H—Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized Maintenance 5.8.

Purpose:  To for  Adding/Deleting  SPRAM Authorizations. For policy specific requirements review  AFI 23-101  and for  IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. the  procedures explain 5.8.1.2.  Recommendations to add or delete SPRAM authorizations are submitted by the requesting organization via letter to the EAE. Additions or increases require justification such as TO references, maintenance directives, correspondence, etc. 5.8.1.2.1.  Computation  method.  The  method  for  computing  the  additional  SPRAM authorized quantity should be included in the justification. Example: If a maintenance directive  states  that  a  quantity  of  two  SPRAM  assets  is  required  per  aircraft  and  24 aircraft  are  assigned  to  the  base,  then  the  SPRAM  quantity  authorized  under  this justification would be 48. 5.8.1.2.2.  Approval.  Each  request  for  changes  to  SPRAM  authorizations  will  be approved  by  the  respective  group  commander  and  forwarded  from  the  EAE  to AFMC.  (T-2).  The  Operations  Group  and  Maintenance  Group  Commanders  (or equivalent)  may  delegate  SPRAM  approval  authority  to  the  squadron  commanders. Delegation  below  that  level  is  not  authorized.  Note:  NWRM  SPRAM  approval authority will not be delegated. 5.8.1.2.2.1.  Locally approved requests are forwarded to the MAJCOM CEMO for tracking  and  in-turn  will  be  forwarded  to  the  MAJCOM  FAM  for  approval.  If approved,  the  MAJCOM  CEMO  then  forwards  the  request  with  a  statement  of unit/MAJCOM funding availability for the requested items to the Lead Command FAM for final approval.  If approved, Lead Command FAM returns the approval with supporting documentation to the MAJCOM CEMO for further distribution to the supported activity for requisitioning purposes. 5.8.1.2.2.2.  Disapproval  at  any  level  warrants  the  return  of  the  request  with reason for the denial to the initiating activity. 5.8.1.2.2.3.  SPRAM  requests  for  entities  where  the  SPM  is  also  the  requester, (e.g.,  Cryptologic  and  Cyber  Systems  Division  (CCSD);  Remote  ReKey  (RRK) program; Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Systems Directorate), will be approved  by  the  SPM's  delegated  authority  and  will  be  accompanied  with  the delegation letter. (T-1) 5.8.1.2.2.4.  Requests for the following RDT&E programs will be approved by the Logistics  Branch  Chief  (or  equivalent)  and  may  be  delegated  to  the  Senior Materiel Leader: (T-2) 5.8.1.2.2.4.1.

A  copy  of  each  letter  requesting  changes  to  SPRAM authorizations  must  be  maintained  by  the  EAE  in  a  folder  along  with  the  current SPRAM listing and the custodian appointment letter. The  letters requesting SPRAM changes  may  be  discarded  once  a  new  SPRAM  listing  signed  by  the  SPRAM custodian is received. 5.8.1.2.4.  Review.  All  SPRAM  authorizations  should  be  reviewed  annually  and certified  as  valid.  Certification  may  occur  during  the  annual  SPRAM  inventory  and may be noted on the approved SPRAM listing. 5.8.2.  Maintain SPRAM Custodian File. 5.8.2.1.  Purpose: To explain the procedures for maintaining the SPRAM Custodian File. For  policy  specific  requirements  review  AFI  23-101  and  for  IT  specific  guidance  use AFH 23-123. 5.8.2.2.  The  EAE  maintains  SPRAM  Custodian  File  on  each  account  where  SPRAM accountability approval has been given. The file is made up of the following mandatory items  which  EAE  will  maintain  for  each  organization  Master  SPRAM  Jacket  File.  The same mandatory items will also be maintained by the SPRAM custodian to maintain the status of the SPRAM account.

Load. The following is applicable: 5.8.3.2.1.1.  Use  any  terminal  for  the  load,  change  and  delete  SPRAM  detail record input. However, any input through a satellite terminal function must be for that specific satellite system designator. 5.8.3.2.1.2.  Load the item record for the applicable system designator, if required. 5.8.3.2.1.3.  Enter an I in position 64 of the load, change and delete SPRAM detail record input to call the issue program. Assets will either be issued from the item record serviceable balance or due-outs will be established. 5.8.3.2.2.  Change.  Change  the  special  purpose  asset  detail  as  follows  by  processing load, change and delete SPRAM detail record input with a C in position 80. 5.8.3.2.2.1.  Authorized  quantity.  Do  not  decrease  the  authorized  quantity  below the total quantity on hand for the prime and all substitute detail records. 5.8.3.2.2.2.  Item  code.  To  realign  the  prime/substitute  relationship  in  a  group, change  the  existing  substitute  record  to  the  prime  record  or  add  a  new  prime authorization.  If  you  make  this  realignment,  the  existing  prime  is  changed  to  a substitute  if  an  on-hand  quantity  exists.  If  the  on-hand  quantity  is  zero,  the program deletes the detail substitute. 5.8.3.2.2.3.  Type  SPRAM  flag.  Input  the  type  SPRAM  flag  on  the  prime authorization.  This  input  changes  all  detail  records  with  the  same  document number and system designator. 5.8.3.2.2.4.  SRD. A valid SRD must be entered on the prime detail record. This input will update the prime and sub detail of the SPRAM asset. 5.8.3.2.3.  Delete.  Delete  a  special  purpose  asset  detail  record  when  all  on  hand balances are 0 by processing the load, change and delete input with a D in position 80 if  the  on-hand  balance  equals  zero.

Provides  a  listing  of  all  items  authorized,  on  hand,  and  due-out  for  those organizations authorized SPRAM assets. 5.8.4.2.1.1.  Serves as  a  custody  receipt and authorization certification document and is signed by the custodian or alternate custodian. 5.8.4.2.1.2.  Provides  equipment  inventory  count  inputs  for  the  inventory  of SPRAM assets. 5.8.4.2.2.  Daily  Document  Register.  The  Daily  Document  Register  provides  the SPRAM custodian with a daily recap of all transactions affecting the SPRAM account in document number sequence. Maintain the Daily Document Registers until receipt of an updated and signed SPRAM Report List listings are received. 5.8.4.2.3.  Consolidated  Inventory  Adjustment  Document  Register.  Certification  and approval sort codes for SPRAM adjustments are as follows. (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt  2,  Ch  5  Consolidated  Inventory  Adjustment  Document  Register  processing procedures.) 5.8.4.2.3.1.  Certifying Sort Code H. 5.8.4.2.3.2.  Approval  Sort  Code  1-5,  which  is  the  same  as  other  inventory adjustments. 5.8.4.2.4.  Priority Monitor Report and Due Out Validation Listings. Maintain current copies  of  the  Priority  Monitor  Report  and  Due  out  Validation  Listings  until superseded. 5.8.4.2.5.  Custodian Request Log. Maintain a copy of an AF Form 126 with suspense and  completed  documentation  submitted  to  LRS.  Completed  documentation  may  be destroyed upon receipt and approval of a new SPRAM Report List listing. 5.8.4.2.6.  Supporting  Documentation.  Maintain  all  supporting  documentation  for (all)  SPRAM  assets  authorized  on  the  account.  Authorized  document  codes  are  as follows: 5.8.4.2.6.1.  First digit: 5.8.4.2.6.1.1.

All copies of hand receipts, logs, letters, etc., used to identify assets stored or used outside the custodian's work center. 5.8.4.2.7.  Records  of  Assets  Off-Base.  Maintain  all  records  of  SPRAM  assets  that accompany  end-items  (that  is,  aircraft,  test  stations,  etc.)  off-station  for  other  than deployments. Maintain  a copy of the correspondence directing the movement of the assets  with  applicable  model  and  serial  numbers.  If  end-items  return  without  the SPRAM assets, the depot or using location will be tasked to return the assets, provide a replacement, or accept accountability. Coordinate with the EAE to process returns and  shipments  to  the  gaining  location,  if  required.  Maintain  copies  of  returns  and shipment documentation until an updated SPRAM Report List is approved and filed. 5.8.4.2.8.  Relief  of  Accountability  Documentation.  Maintain  all  copies  of documentation  requesting  relief  of  accountability  for  assets  lost,  damaged,  or destroyed  until  updated  SPRAM  Report  List  listing  reflects  all  actions  have  been completed and the SPRAM Report List is signed and filed. 5.8.5.  Deploy/Transfer SPRAM Assets. 5.8.5.1.  Purpose: To explain the deployment/transfer of SPRAM procedures. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.8.5.2.  A  deployment  is  the  temporary  movement  of  assets  from  the  home  base  to another location or base with accountability remaining at the home station. A transfer is the  movement  of  assets  and  accountability  to  another  location  or  base.  When  it  is necessary to  deploy or transfer SPRAM assets, the SPRAM custodian must provide the EAE a listing of all items to be transferred or deployed indicating the duration, location, and any special actions required. (T-2). The custodian determines if any requirements on order at the time of transfer action should remain on-order or be cancelled. 5.8.5.2.1.  Authority to Deploy or Transfer. The organization commander possessing the SPRAM assets has the authority to  deploy  or transfer SPRAM assets. However, for  management  purposes,  MAJCOMs  retain  the  authority  to  identify  specific SPRAM  assets  that  require  MAJCOM  approval  before  they  are  deployed  or transferred. 5.8.5.2.2.  Losing  EAE.  When  directed  by  the  MAJCOM  to  deploy  or  transfer SPRAM  assets,  the  SPRAM  custodian  identifies  the  assets  to  the  EAE.  The  losing EAE does the following: 5.8.5.2.2.1.  List of assets. After receiving the deployment or transfer listing from the  custodian,  logistics  plans,  and  appropriate  staff  agencies,  finalize  the  lists  of assets to be deployed or transferred. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 331 5.8.5.2.2.2.  Prepare the inputs necessary to deploy, return, or transfer the selected items (Equipment  Deployment/Return  Transaction/EAID  Accountability Transfer/EAID Accountability Termination). 5.8.5.2.2.2.1.  Use  the  Equipment/SPRAM  Single  Item  Deployment/Return Input to deploy or return single items (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the input format). 5.8.5.2.2.2.2.  Use  Equipment/SPRAM  Accountability  Transfer  inputs  to transfer  single  items  (see  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5)  for  the  input format).  Note:  EAID  Accountability  Transfer,  EAID  Accountability Termination  and  Accountability  Transfer  transactions  are  not  authorized  for NWRM  equipment.  Contact  the  NWRM  Transaction  Control  Cell  for processing instructions. 5.8.5.2.2.2.3.  Use  EAID  Accountability  Termination inputs  for  group selection of assets for deployment, return, or transfer. (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the input format.). 5.8.5.2.2.3.  Shipping  destination  record.  Ask  Customer  Support  to  load  a shipping  destination  record  for  the  ship-to  SRAN.  This  provides  a  complete mailing address when shipping documents are output. 5.8.5.2.2.4.  Multi-item  custody  receipt  transfer.  When  the  items  selected  for transfer will be moved as a complete unit to another Supply Equipment account, prepare the input to show that the transfer is made as a multi-item custody receipt transfer.  This  option  is  only  available  with  group  processing  of  assets  for deployment, return, or transfer. 5.8.5.2.2.5.  Single-item  custody  receipt documents. When the items  selected for transfer  will  be  shipped,  transported,  and  received  as  individual  items,  use materiel  management  shipping  documents.  Transfers  to  non-Supply  Equipment accounts  are  always  made  on  materiel  management  shipping  documents. Equipment  Deployment/Return  and  EAID  Accountability  Transfer  inputs  will only produce materiel management output documents. 5.8.5.2.2.6.  Cover  letter.  Prepare  a  cover  letter  to  the  gaining  LRS  CC/AO  and attach the following: 5.8.5.2.2.6.1.  Shipping documents. 5.8.5.2.2.6.2.  Item  Record  load/Load,  Change,  Delete  SPRAM  Asset  Detail Records/  Accountability  Transfer (when  produced  by  EAID Accountability Termination). inputs 5.8.5.2.2.6.3.  DD  Forms  1348-6  related  to  L  and  P  numbered  items transferred. 5.8.5.2.2.7.  Assets  and  quantities  transferred.  Forward  to  the  gaining  LRS CC/AO MAJCOM a listing of the assets and quantities transferred. 5.8.5.2.2.8.  Names  of  custodians.  Obtain  and  keep  the  names  of  the  custodians who  will  accompany  the  deployed  or  transferred  assets  and  hand-carry  the 332 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 materiel management documentation. 5.8.5.2.2.9.  Due-ins  and  due-outs.  Determine  if  the  losing  EAE  should  cancel due-ins  and due-outs  or keep them in  the  ILS-S database.  Before canceling due-ins and due-outs, consider such factors as urgency of need by the unit before and after  transfer,  avoiding  excessive  shipping  costs,  and  the  availability  of  the  item from base sources. 5.8.5.2.3.  Gaining  EAE.  When  the  deployed  or  transferred  unit  arrives  at  the  new location,  the  gaining  unit  property  custodian  receives  it  and  signs  the  resulting SPRAM Report List. 5.8.5.2.4.  EAID Accountability Termination Input Options. Before processing EAID Accountability  Termination  input,  EAE  personnel  must  understand  that  the  EAID Accountability  Termination  input  has  several  options.  For  example,  Item  Record Load,  Load,  Change,  Delete  SPRAM  Asset  Detail  Records,  and  Accountability Transfer inputs can be produced to load item records, establish special purpose assets detail records, and receive property. If a substitute item is deployed, manually prepare a  Load,  Change,  Delete  SPRAM  Asset  Detail  Records  to  load  a  prime  detail  to  the ILS-S database. is to transferred 5.8.5.2.5.  End  Item  Transfer.  The  following  procedures  apply  when  an  end  item(s) (aircraft/missile) the  AFMC  Aerospace  Maintenance  and Regeneration  Activity.  Upon  notification  of  an  end  item  transfer,  AFMC  will terminate accountability for all installed and support equipment, SPRAM assets, and -21  technical  order  assets.  These  procedures  will  minimize  the  number  of  AFEMS (C001) reporting errors for FB/E2373 and the losing bases. 5.8.5.2.5.1.  Assets  Transferred  On-Board  with  the  Aircraft/Missile.  EAID Accountability  Termination  documents  will  not  be  processed  to  FB/E2373  for aircraft/missile  installed  equipment  when  the  aircraft/missiles  are  transferred  to AFMC Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Activity for retirement/storage. AFMC  will  process  the  EAID  Accountability  Termination/EAID  Accountability Transfer  documents  using  the  losing  base  SRAN.  Accountability  Transfer documents will not be generated for installed Equipment assets located on board the  aircraft  or  missile.  The  reason  why  accountability  ended  (aircraft  transferred to  AFMC  Aerospace  Maintenance for retirement/storage,  aircraft  tail  number)  will  be  annotated  on  the  EAID Accountability  Termination  EAID  Accountability  Transfer  output  documents. Copies  of  the  EAID  Accountability  Termination  /EAID  Accountability  Transfer terminations  will  be  provided  to  the  equipment  custodian.  Copy  one  is  filed  in Document  Control.  AFMC  is  responsible  for  clearing  all  in  transit  delinquent shipments identified by the AFEMS (C001) as a result of erroneously processing EAID  Accountability  Termination  /  EAID  Accountability  Transfer  documents. Note:  EAID  Accountability  Transfer,  EAID  Accountability  Termination  and Accountability  Transfer  transactions  are  not  authorized  for  NWRM  equipment. Contact the NWRM Transaction Control Cell for processing instructions. Instead of  processing  EAID  Accountability  Transfer,  refer  to  Sec.  5G,  for  processing  of the inventory adjustment with proper supporting documentation. and  Regeneration  Activity AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 333 5.8.5.2.5.2.  Assets  which  are  shipped  through  transportation  channels.  Use  non-direct shipments (not EAID Accountability Termination) according to procedures contained  in  Sec.  5C,  of  this  manual  to  ship  in-use  spare  assets  not  transferred onboard the  aircraft/missile to  AFMC Aerospace  Maintenance and Regeneration Group  for  storage.  Assets  will  be  shipped  to  FB/E2373,  mark  for  AFMC Aerospace  Maintenance  and  Regeneration  Activity,  Bldg.  7401,  Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ. Shipment suspense details should not  be generated. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for shipping destination record transaction (FRD) format 5.8.5.2.6.  Receive  or  transfer  SPRAM.  Use  the  Accountability  Transfer  input  to process an issue to a special purpose asset detail record. It may be produced by EAID accountability termination processing or by manually preparing individual inputs for the input format (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the format). Section 5I—Inspection and Related Operations 5.9.  Inspection and Related Operations. 5.9.1.  General Requirements for Inspection and Related Operations. include  verifying 5.9.1.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  standard  AF  methods  and  procedures  for  inspection  and related  operations  which identity,  condition  (as  certified  by maintenance  inspectors  or  obvious  physical  damage)  and  status  marking,  tagging,  and labeling  of  property  at  U.S.  AF  activities.  The  contents  of  this  chapter  also  include special storage and handling to include condition and identity changes of materiel and are applicable  to  all  activities  unless  prescribed  otherwise  in  the  individual  section.  For policy  requirements  review  AFI  23-101,  Sec.  5I.  For  other  policy  specific  requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.9.1.2.  Caution. Under no circumstances will logistics personnel sign DD Form 1574-1 certifying an asset as a serviceable condition item. 5.9.1.3.  Reference  MIL-STD-129  and  MIL-STD-130,  prescribes  identification  marking requirements  to  be  followed  by  contractors  and  AF  activities.  Serviceable  items  being received, stored, issued, or shipped must be identified either through original containers or  subsequent  containers.  Example:  100  bolts  are  received  into  your  account  in  one clearly identified package. A shipment for 10 bolts is requested from  your account. The materiel  management  technician  would  place  the  10  bolts  into  another  container  (i.e., Baggie) then annotate the identification (NSN, Noun, Contract and Lot Numbers) and the quantity  contents  legibly  on  the  new  container  prior  to  shipment,  accompanied  by  the shipment s DD Form 1348-1/1A. DD Form 1574-1 can be used to identify property if the remark field contains the following statement: ID PURPOSES ONLY. 5.9.1.4.  The following actions will be performed: 5.9.1.4.1.  Requirements for XD (Reparable) items: 5.9.1.4.1.1.  Incoming Shipments: 5.9.1.4.1.1.1.  Verify identification on the outside container matches DD Form 1348-1A  or  DD  Form  1348-1A.  If  the  outside  container  does  not  match  the DD 1348-1/1A, the container must be opened to properly identify the item. If 334 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 the  actual  property  does  not  match  the  DD  Form  1348-1A,  submit  a  Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR)/Reports of Discrepancy (ROD) as outlined in AFI 23-101, Sec. 5I. 5.9.1.4.1.1.2.  Ensure  condition  paper  work  is  located  on  the  outside  of  the container. If condition paperwork is not located on the outside of the container but  the  item  identification  is  matched  according  to  Sec.  5I  and  there  is  no suspected  damage,  the  DD  Form  1348-1A  will  suffice  as  condition paperwork.  The  DD  Form  1348-1A  must  be  affixed  to  the  outside  container for  originator  tracing  purposes.  No  further  labeling/tagging  or  opening containers are required. Exception: Items of sufficient size to make stenciling more  appropriate  due  to  outside  storage  and  exposure  to  weather,  or  when stenciling  is  preferred  by  AF  activities.  When  stenciling  is  accomplished  in lieu  of  tagging,  the  minimum  information  will  be  the  data  contained  on  DD Forms  1574/1574-1  (inspector’s  name/signature  or  the  inspector’s  stamp certifying the condition of the asset on the outside of the container). 5.9.1.4.1.1.3.  If serviceability or condition of property cannot be identified or is  in  question, an SDR must be processed prior  to  acceptance into the  ILS-S outlined in AFI 23-101, Sec. 5I. 5.9.1.4.1.2.  Incoming Returns: 5.9.1.4.1.2.1.  Ensure  DD  Form  1574  series  tag  is  completely  filled  out  and contains a legible signature from a certified maintenance inspector stating the identification  of  the  asset  and  the  condition  is  placed  on  the  outside  of  the container. If DD Form 1574 series tag is placed on the outside of the container no  further  labeling/tagging  or  opening  of  containers  are  required.  Exception: Items  of  sufficient  size  to  make  stenciling  more  appropriate  due  to  outside storage  and  exposure  to  weather,  or  when  stenciling  is  preferred  by  AF activities.  When  stenciling  is  accomplished  in  lieu  of  tagging,  the  minimum information  will  be  the  data  contained  on  DD  Forms  1574  series  tag (inspector’s  name/signature  or  the  inspector’s  stamp  certifying  the  condition of the asset on the outside of the container). 5.9.1.4.2.  Not Used. 5.9.1.4.3.  General requirements for both reparable and expendable items: 5.9.1.4.3.1.  Open packages with single items of supply received in vendor-sealed containers  for  additional  inspections  or  tagging  as  to  the  condition  and  or identification when subjected to one or more of the following actions: 5.9.1.4.3.1.1.  Property  has  been  used;  been  rendered  incomplete;  suffered obvious  or  suspected  damage,  deterioration,  corrosion;  or  had  latent  defects disclosed. 5.9.1.4.3.1.2.  Condition  or  status  of  the  property  has  been  changed  by direction of higher authority. 5.9.1.4.3.1.3.  Identification  of  the  property  has  been  lost,  defaced,  or obliterated. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 335 5.9.1.4.3.1.4.  The  container  shows  evidence  of  possible  damage  to  the materiel, or the item history dictates inspection action is required regardless of pack. 5.9.1.4.3.1.5.  When  the  maximum  operating  time  of  the  item  is  limited  and partial  service  life  has  been  accrued  but  the  item  is  returned  to  serviceable stock  after  minor  repair  under  the  provisions  of  TO  00-20-3,  Maintenance Processing of Reparable Property and Repair Cycle Asset Control System. 5.9.1.4.3.2.  For bare items utilize the item identity plate if available. 5.9.1.4.3.3.  To validate identity of an asset cross reference the assets part number with  catalog  records  utilizing  Master  Item  Identification  System  (MIICS)  and/or Federal Logistics Data 5.9.1.4.4.  Original  Containers  affected  by  conversion  to  national  stock  numbers (NSNs) or superseded by new codes or NSNs: 5.9.1.4.4.1.  Do  not  open  solely  for  application  of  new  Stock  List  Change  data (SLC) while in storage. 5.9.1.4.4.2.  Identify  proper  SLC  data  except  in  those  instances  when  it  is  not economically  feasible  to  remark  each  container  in  storage,  due  to  quantity involved. In such instances, a sufficient quantity will be identified and re-tagged to facilitate issue and inventory. 5.9.1.4.4.2.1.  Mark  the  location  adequately  with  the  use  of  a  bin  card  to indicate  that  some  items  have  not  been  retagged.  When  issues  or  shipments are  made,  all  items  and  /or  unit  packs,  as  well  as  outside  or  intermediate containers, will be marked with the current SLC data (MIL-STD-129). 5.9.1.4.5.  Use the correct DD Form 1570 series tag IAW  TO 00-20-3 to  prepare all authorized  DD  Form  1570  series  tags/labels  to  include  DD  Form  1574,  DD  Forms 1575,  Suspended  Tag-Materiel,  DD  Forms  1576,  Test/Modification  Tag-Materiel, and/or DD Form 1577, Unserviceable (Condemned) Tag-Materiel. 5.9.1.4.5.1.  Prepare  by  imprinting  or  by  mechanical  equipment  if  equipment  is available and installation is authorized. 5.9.1.4.5.2.  Prepare tags and labels manually by use of lead pencil, rubber stamp or  non-smear  ball-point  pen  when  small  quantities  are  involved  or  mechanical equipment is not available. 5.9.1.4.5.2.1.  In instances where condition  tags or labels  would be subjected to  conditions  that  would  cause  the  ball-point  pen  ink  to  run  or  become illegible, the use of ball-point pen will not be utilized. 5.9.1.4.6.  Use MIL-STD-129 and/or MIL-STD-130 for marking and identification. 5.9.1.4.6.1.  MIL-STD-129  provides  the  minimum  requirements  for  uniform military marking for shipment and storage. Marking is the application of numbers, letters,  labels,  tags,  symbols,  or  colors  on  containers  or  packaging  to  provide identification and expedite handling during shipment and storage. 336 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.9.1.4.6.2.  MIL-STD-130  provides requires  product identification nameplates, product identification labels, and product identification tags be designed in a specific way. the  guideline that 5.9.1.4.7.  Metal tags specification MIL-P-4745, Aerospace Identification Tags Metal, (USAF): 5.9.1.4.7.1.  May be utilized to identify the contents of containers having only one line item and which are stored outside or being shipped overseas. 5.9.1.4.8.1.  Metal embossing plates: 5.9.1.4.8.1.1.  May be utilized for applying item description and other data to forms,  tags,  labels,  listings,  etc.,  at  AF  installations  where  equipment  is authorized and available. 5.9.1.4.9.  Activity Supply Inspector: 5.9.1.4.9.1.  Ensures  that  all  materiel  received,  stored,  issued,  or  shipped  is properly  identified,  and  the  legibility  and  permanence  of  the  information contained on tags, labels, and other markings are maintained. 5.9.1.5.  Condition  and  Item  Management  Data  Changes.  Changing  the  condition, identity, or item management data of assets may be needed under certain circumstances. The document flow for Document Flow for Condition/Identity Change (FCC or FCH) is described in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 5.9.1.5.1.  Condition  Changes.  Processing  Condition  Changes  (FCC)  is  described  in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 5.9.1.6.  Suspect  Materiel.  AFMC  will  coordinate  stock  screening  action  requests received  from  the  Air  Force  Discrepant  Materiel  Program  Office  (AFDMPO)  DLA, GSA, Depot item managers, Air Staff, etc. 5.9.1.6.1.  AFMC  will  suspense  supported  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activities  to perform  stock  screening  actions  and  will  maintain  all  stock  screening  notifications and screening results received from the bases until suspect flags or exception control data is removed. 5.9.1.6.2.  Supported  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activities  must  also  maintain documentation on suspect items loaded at their location. (T-1). 5.9.2.  Processing Identity Changes. 5.9.2.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  procedures  for  processing  identity  changes.  For  policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 5.9.2.2.  Use  the  identity  change  processing  to  re-identify  a  specific  item  or  quantity  of supplies from one stock number to another when it is recorded on the item record, EAID, or a SPRAM detail record. Note: Identity changes are not allowed for vehicles and WRM while on EAID. Process a return to  stock before the identity  change input is  processed. The item can may be issued back to the appropriate EAID under the new NSN. 5.9.2.2.1.  Identity Changes. Identity changes may be used to correct the identification of  serviceable  items  in  storage,  but  they  should  be  very  rare.  When  possible,  post AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 337 processing  will  be  used  to  correct  the  identification  of  items  on  detail  records.  The identity change of a Weapon or CCI/ COMSEC asset will not be allowed. Processing Identity Changes are described in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 5.9.2.2.2.  Item  Management  Data  Changes.  Some  item  management  data  changes (e.g.,  controlled  item  code  changes)  will  automatically  cause  the  generation  of warehouse change documents. Warehouse personnel must process warehouse change documents  as  quickly  as  possible.  Warehouse  Change  Documents  are  described  in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5. 5.9.2.3.  Whoever  identifies  that  there  is  a  discrepancy  between  the  item/detail  record’s stock  number  assignment  in  the  ILS-S  and  what  the  asset’s  actual  stock  number  is physically (also known as misidentified) will notify a qualified inspector (as deemed by AFI  23-101,  Sec.  5I).  Note:  Normally,  the  qualified  inspector  for  assets  on  equipment and SPRAM details is aligned under EAE. Whereas, the qualified inspector for all other assets is from the Inspection Element. 5.9.2.4.  The qualified inspector: 5.9.2.4.1.  Inspects  the  asset  to  confirm  it  is  misidentified.  Exception:  The  LRS CC/AO  may,  at  his/her  discretion,  determine  that  an  asset  does  not  have  to  be physically inspected by an LRS/Materiel Management Activity inspector if sufficient information is provided by E-mail, fax, or other means. 5.9.2.4.2.  If  the  asset  is  misidentified,  research  the  ILS-S  to  ensure  the  discrepancy cannot  be  resolved  by  other  means  (i.e.,  record  reversal,  return,  etc.).  Extreme  care should be taken when processing  an identity change since it creates both  a decrease and an increase inventory adjustment record. 5.9.2.4.3.  Re-tag/label the property. 5.9.2.4.4.  Ensure  the  identity  change  meets  the  criteria  specified  in  Processing Identity  Changes,  AFH  23-123,  V2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  prior  to  initiating  any  transaction processing. 5.9.2.4.5.  Coordinate  with  EAE  to  ensure  changes  are  made  to  equipment  and SPRAM details as necessary IAW Sec. 5D. Note: Items that are  deployed cannot be re-identified, but the remaining on-hand quantities can be re-identified. 5.9.2.4.6.  Process the identity change transaction in the ILS-S.

Remove  FER  or  1SA  document  when  new  R14  or  R25  is received. 5.9.3.  Processing Assets for Maintenance Functional Check. 5.9.3.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  procedures  for  processing  maintenance  functional checks. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. The types of assets requiring function checks fall into two categories: 5.9.3.1.1.  Assets  (other  than  buildup  items)  requiring  extensive  functional  checks before installation. 5.9.3.1.2.  Serviceability  of  an  asset  is  in  question.  Assets  that  appear  to  have  been mishandled while in stock, dropped, etc. or assets received in a suspect condition. 5.9.3.2.  Responsibilities. 5.9.3.2.1.  Supply  Inspectors  normally  manage  the  functional  check  program  for  the LRS  CC/AO.  At  the  option  of  the  LRS  CC/AO  or  the  MAJCOM,  the  functional check program for readiness spares packages may be managed separately. 5.9.3.2.2.  The  list  of  functional  check  assets  will  be  compiled  by  Maintenance Superintendent (MX Supt) and forwarded to the LRS, IAW AFI 21-101. (T-1). 5.9.3.3.  Identification  of  items  requiring  functional  checks  before  installation.  The Maintenance contact point for functional checks prepares a listing of all items requiring extensive  functional  checks  before  installation  and  forward  a  copy  of  this  list  to  supply Inspection. This listing is usually in the form of a signed letter. All listings, letters, etc., submitted  by  Maintenance  point  of  contact  will  be  kept  on  file  in  Inspection  until  the superseded or items no longer require functional checks. 5.9.3.3.1.  Inspection of items requiring functional check. Upon receipt of the listing, Inspection personnel perform following: 5.9.3.3.1.1.  Process  an  inquiry  to  determine  the  location  of  all  assets  on  the listing, including interchangeable assets. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 339 5.9.3.3.1.2.  Physically  inspect  all  assets  on  the  inquiry  to  determine  if  the  local maintenance activity has already performed the functional check. The appearance of  a  base  maintenance  inspector's  stamp/signature  is  adequate  proof  of  the function  check.  If  Inspection  personnel  find  any  assets  requiring  a  functional check, they process them IAW Sec. 5I. items identified  on 5.9.3.3.1.3.  Process  FCD  inputs  to  load  or  delete  the  functional  check  flag  for those (See  Stock  Control  Data  –Load/Change/Delete  Input  (FCD),  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  2  for  FCD format.) The FCD input changes all master and interchangeable items in the group having the same system designator. this listing. 5.9.3.3.1.4.  At the option of a MAJCOM, DD Form 1576 or 1576-1 may be used for  items  that  require  in-stock  functional  checks;  otherwise,  annotations  will  be made  on  either  the  DD  Form  1574  or  1574-1  to  indicate  in-stock  functional checks are required. 5.9.3.3.1.5.  Remove the distinctive markings from the bin labels for those items requiring deletion. 5.9.3.3.2.  Processing Items Requiring Functional Checks. When Inspection personnel find an item for which the local maintenance inspector has not indicated the condition of  serviceability  by  stamping  or  signing  the  DD  Form  1574,  they  contact  the maintenance contact point or Production Control to determine when the asset(s) can be scheduled for a functional check. 5.9.3.3.2.1.  Receive  time  and  place  of  delivery.  Maintenance  contact  point informs Inspection personnel what maintenance shop will perform the functional check and when the functional check can be conducted. 5.9.3.3.2.2.  Issue  to  Maintenance.  Process  an  ISU  or  MSI  using  activity  code  C and  the  organization  and  shop  code  furnished  by  Maintenance  point  of  contact. Note:  Process  MSI  for  assets  accounted  for  on  MRSP,  MSK,  WRM,  or  supply point detail records. See Issue From Detail Record (MSI) Processing Instructions, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for MSI format. 5.9.3.3.2.3.  Deliver  items.  Deliver  the  items  to  the  appropriate  shop  where  they will  be  controlled  under  normal  DIFM  procedures  until  returned  to  Supply.  If these  items  need  repair,  the  required  bits  and  pieces  will  be  charged  to  the repairing shop. 5.9.3.3.2.4.  Return  from  Maintenance.  When  maintenance  returns  the  item  to supply, process a turn-in (TIN) based on the condition of the item and the action taken code. See Recoverable Item Turn-In Request (TIN), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6 for the TIN format. 5.9.3.4.  Processing Assets of Questionable Serviceability. When the serviceability of any asset  is  in  doubt,  the  supply  Inspectors  will  place  the  item  in  a  suspect  condition  and process the item to maintenance using the functional check process. 5.9.3.4.1.  Issue  to  Maintenance.  Issue  the  suspect  item  to  maintenance  using  MSI with  activity  code  C  and  the  organization  and  shop  code  furnished  by  maintenance 340 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 point  of  contact.  The  issue  to  maintenance  results  in  no  financial  updates  to  the organization’s O&M funds because of the suspect condition code and the “C” activity code. 5.9.3.4.2.  Return  from  Maintenance.  Credit  will  be  allowed  based  on serviceability of the item and the action taken code as indicated below: the 5.9.3.4.2.1.  Serviceable  with  Action  Taken  Code  B.  When  maintenance determines  the  item  is  serviceable  (condition  code  A)  and  performs  no  repair (action taken code B) process the turn-in (TIN) with a suspect condition code and then change the condition of the asset from suspect to serviceable process using a Condition  Code  Change  input  (FCC).  This  process  prevents  crediting  the maintenance organization for repairs it did not perform. See Processing Condition Changes, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the FCC format. 5.9.3.4.2.2.  Serviceable  with  Action  Taken  Code  Other than  B.  When maintenance  determines  the  item  was  unserviceable  and  repairs  the  item  (action taken code indicating repair, other than B) process the TIN as serviceable to allow the maintenance organization to receive credit for the repair performed. is 5.9.3.4.2.3.  Unserviceable.  When  maintenance  determines unserviceable  and  performs  no  repair,  process  the  TIN  as  unserviceable. Maintenance will not receive any credit for the return of the unserviceable item. item the 5.9.3.5.  Functional  Checks  Listing.  Program  NGV401  with  the  functional  check  listing option  (or  an  equivalent  local  program)  will  be  processed  as  required,  but  at  least semiannually. A copy of the output will be forwarded to  both  the Maintenance point of contact and Inspection. Upon receipt of the listing, Inspection personnel do the following: 5.9.3.5.1.  Check this listing against the previous listing and with letters submitted by Maintenance point of contact. 5.9.3.5.1.1.  Thoroughly  research  items  added  to  or  deleted  from  the  previous listing. 5.9.3.5.1.2.  If no requests from Maintenance point of contact are on file, ask the Maintenance point of contact to verify the additions or deletions. 5.9.3.5.2.  Update  the  present  listing  manually  or  request  a  new  listing  when  new additions  or  deletions  are  requested.  The  number  of  changes  required  should determine whether to manually update the listing or request a new one. 5.9.3.5.3.  Provide a copy of the Functional Check Listing to Receiving for use during degraded operations. Section 5J—Management of Discrepant, Counterfeit and Suspect Counterfeit Materiel 5.10.  Management of Discrepant, Counterfeit and Suspect Counterfeit Materiel. 5.10.1.  Discrepant,  Counterfeit  and  Suspect  Counterfeit  Materiel  Procedural  Reference. Purpose:  To  provide  reference  to  AF  policy  guidance  and  procedures  regarding  the management  of  discrepant,  counterfeit  and  suspect  counterfeit  materiel.  For  policy  specific requirements and other authoritative sources for discrepant materiel, review AFI 23-101; this AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 341 guidance  identifies  requirements  for  non-conforming  or  malicious  materiel  reporting, investigating, and resolution processes and procedures. Section 5K—Stock Positioning 5.11.  Stock Positioning. 5.11.1.  Asset Redistribution. 5.11.1.1.  Purpose:  Describe  the  processing  actions  for  Stock  Control  or  designated personnel to manage RDO/Referral suspense detail records. 5.11.1.2.  RDO/Referral  suspense  details  will  appear  on  the  Base  Supply  Surveillance Report  (D20),  part  13  and  the  RDO  Metrics  Report  (M22)  (Reference  Surveillance Report (D20/NGV821) and Redistribution Order (RDO Metrics) (M22/NGV885) in AFH 23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  5).  These  listings  provide  management  with  the  capability  to manage and track all incoming RDO/Referral orders when they are in a suspended status. Interrogation  of  the  RDO/Referral  suspense  details  can  also  be  accomplished  by processing a 16 ALL inquiry or an inquiry with retrieval code “T.” 5.11.1.3.  The management of RDO functionality within ES-S is designed to operate with little to no manual intervention. Users can view the ES-S Audit Trail Component (ATC) entries to determine the disposition of each RDO transaction. User can create a list of all RDO  suspense  details  from  any  base  account  (based  on  AFSCDB  data),  list  rejected RDOs, determine if RDO rejects  were cleared without  reprocessing (assuming the clear was processed through  ES-S), and also  determine if a record reversal  and correction on the shipment was performed. The following action is performed: 5.11.1.4.  When a wholesale-directed redistribution transaction (A2*/A4*) is processed in the ILS-S, the system checks for serviceable base assets. If serviceable base assets exist, then the RDO/referral order is subjected to a series of rules, based upon the priority of the redistribution  transaction,  to  determine  what  base  assets  may  be  released  for  shipment. Basically  the  rules  ensure  base  assets  will  only  be  redistributed  to  bases  with  higher priority needs. Those asset release rules are detailed in Redistribution Order (RDO) Asset Release Rules in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. 5.11.1.4.1.  If base assets are available to satisfy the RDO/referral, but some or all of the  required  assets  are  “inaccessible”  for  immediate  shipment,  the  ILS-S  creates  an RDO/referral  suspense  detail  (220)  detail.  There  are  numerous  reasons  why serviceable  assets  may  be  suspended.  For  instance,  RDO/referral  suspensions  can occur due to ongoing physical inventory actions, out of warehouse storage locations, because  the  serviceable  assets  are  deployed  in  an  MSK,  and  when  an  external management decision is required. The RDO/referral suspense detail is maintained in the ILS-S until the redistribution action is either honored or denied. 5.11.1.4.2.  When  an  A2*/A4*  is  suspended,  either  an  I136  or  I023  management notice  is  produced  and  forwarded  to  Stock  Control.  See  Common  RDO  (A2*), Referral  Order  (A4*),  And  Excess  Disposition  Shipment  (FTR)  Rejects  and Corrective Actions in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for common RDO rejects. 342 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 5.11.1.4.3.  Process a query to determine if the 220-RDO-QTY can be satisfied from other assets or substitute NSNs. 5.11.1.4.4.  Personnel  should  check  the  numeric  source  coded  item  in  D043  to determine what the source code was before it was locally tailored. If the source code is preferable to the source code on the input stock number (including consideration of the item jump-to-code) then the item can be shipped to satisfy the RDO. If research indicates  the  asset  cannot  be  shipped,  then  take  action  to  deny  the  RDO.  Numeric source codes indicate that the interchangeable and substitute group (I&SG) has been locally tailored, and the item may or may not be in a subgroup that is usable in lieu of the requested stock number. 5.11.1.4.5.  Re-input RDO (A2*/A4*) transactions to either honor or deny suspended redistribution/referral  orders.  See  Redistribution/Referral  Order  (A2*/A4*)  Input  in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. 5.11.1.4.5.1.  Re-input RDOs with TEX code asterisk (*) to ship a substitute NSN or to honor RDOs with off-base supply point or deployed MSK assets. However, before  using  TEX  “*,”  personnel  should  ensure  that  the  A2*/A4*  satisfies  the asset  release  rules  detailed  in  Redistribution  Order  (RDO)  Asset  Release  Rules AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. Note TEX “*” is note authorized for RSP details. Failure  to  re-input  suspended  RDOs  with  the  “*”  could  cause  duplicate RDO/Referral  suspense  details. When using TEX code “*,” re-input  the original A2*/A4*, with the following changes: 5.11.1.4.5.2.  If  shipping  from  an  MSK  or  supply  point  detail,  use  the  NSN  and the  quantity  that  will  be  released  from  the  detail.  Use  the  suffix  code  from  the RDO/Referral  suspense  detail.  If MSK or supply point assets  are available, then Stock Control can ship (A2*/A4*) the asset directly off the appropriate detail or the  assets  can  be  turned  in  and  shipped  off  the  item  record  by  re-inputting  the A2*/A4*. Stock Control should normally ship directly off the detail in lieu of the return/ship process. 5.11.1.4.5.3.  If shipping a substitute item, use the substitute NSN and the quantity of the substitute NSN that will be released for the RDO. Use the suffix code from the RDO/Referral suspense detail. 5.11.1.4.6.  Re-input  the  applicable  denial  code  into  the  TEX  code  field  of  the A2*/A4*. The TEX code field is a dual purpose field and must reflect the appropriate denial  code.  See  authorized  denial  codes  in  Redistribution  Order  Denial  (B7*) Transaction Format in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. 5.11.1.4.7.  If  a  referral  order  (A4*)  is  partially  or  completely  denied  either programmatically  or  manually,  the  ILS-S  outputs  a  supply  status  (AE*)  transaction with “CB” status. 5.11.1.4.8.  When  ICPs  that  initiated  RDOs  and  referral  orders  have  not  received status from the shipping bases, the ICPs follow-up to the shipping bases for updated status. 5.11.1.4.8.1.  When  AFMC  or  C-ICPs  has  not  received  status  from  a  shipping AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 343 base  indicating  when  (or  whether)  an  RDO  has  been  honored,  the  ICP  sends  a redistribution  order  follow-up  (BF7)  transaction  to  the  shipping  base.  The redistribution order follow-up transaction format is provided in ILS-S Responses to  RDO  and  Referral  Order  Follow-ups  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  2.  The ILS-S  response  to  these  wholesale  redistribution  order  follow-up  transactions depends  upon  whether  the  base  has  received  the  RDO,  and  if  so,  whether  the RDO  has  been  honored.  The  ILS-S  responses  to  ICP  RDO  follow-ups  are provided  in  ILS-S  Responses  to  RDO  and  Referral  Order  Follow-ups,  AFH  23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2. 5.11.1.4.8.2.  Referral  order  follow-ups.  ICPs  who  initiate  referral  orders  can follow-up  to  shipping  bases  via  MILSTRIP  follow-up  (AF*)  transactions.  Refer to Reply To Redistributable Order Follow Up Shipment Status (BL7) in AFH 23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for  a  reference  to  MILSTRIP  follow-up  output (AF*)transactions. See ILS-S Responses to RDO and Referral Order Follow-ups, AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  2  for  details  regarding  the  ILS-S  responses  to referral order follow-ups. 5.11.1.4.9.  Initiators of RDOs and referral orders communicate cancellation requests via  AC*  transactions.  See  Requisition  Cancellation  Request  (AC1/AK1)  Output Transaction  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  5  for  the  format  for  AC*  transactions. When  RDO  or  referral  order  cancellation  request  transactions  are  input,  the  ILS-S attempts to locate a shipment suspense or SNC detail with an equal document number and  suffix  code;  or  an  RDO/referral  suspense  detail.  The  action  taken  by  the  retail system  depends  upon  what  details  are  found.  See  ILS-S  Responses  to  RDO  and Referral Order Follow-ups, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2 for a complete explanation of the ILS-S responses to RDO/referral order cancellation requests. 344 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Chapter 6 MATERIEL RETURNS Section 6A—Overview 6.1.  Overview.  This  chapter  outlines  AF  guidance  for  performing  supply  chain  materiel management processes associated with materiel returns and disposal of materiel. These activities include  Returns  and  Disposal.  DoD  4100.39-M,  Federal  Logistics  Information  System  (FLIS) Procedures  Manual,  DoDM  4140.01,  DoD  4160.21-M,  and  DoD  4160.28-M-V2,  Defense Demilitarization Manual, Demilitarization Coding serve as primary DoD reference sources. Section 6B—Returns 6.2.  Returns. 6.2.1.  Material Returns to the Retail Supply Activity. 6.2.1.1.  Purpose: To explain return procedures. For policy specific requirements review, AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. Caution: Classified items will be handled IAW AFI 16-1404. 6.2.1.2.  Return requests will be processed without delay. 6.2.1.3.  The following actions will be performed for all returns: 6.2.1.3.1.  Perform physical bare item inspection of property (identaplate, engraving, decal,  or  label)  to  ensure  proper  identification  of  asset  IAW  MIL-STD-130.  Ensure materiel received matches supporting documentation and ILS-S records. 6.2.1.3.1.1.  If  property  identification  does  not  match  information  in  the  ILS-S, review interchangeable/substitute data within the system or research in the D043B Interchangeable and Substitute (I&S) maintenance system. 6.2.1.3.1.2.  If  I&S  data Interchangeability Code I for return processing. is  not  compatible,  action  may  dictate  use  of 6.2.1.3.2.  Interchangeability  Code  I.  Use  extreme  discretion  in  processing  Due-in From  Maintenance  (DIFM)  returns  with  Interchangeability  Code  I.  Improper processing will lead to incorrect inventory control. 6.2.1.3.2.1.  The submitting organization will create a memorandum certifying the item returned is acceptable to clear existing DIFM records; this memorandum will include supporting documentation such as TO’s or service manuals. 6.2.1.3.2.2.  The  FSC  will  use  this  information  to  verify  the  item  returned  is acceptable for the item issued and should not be or is not linked in the applicable Interchangeable  Substitute  Group.  All  supporting  documentation  will  be  filed with  a  copy  of  the  D20,  Base  Supply  Surveillance  Report  for  a  period  of  two years. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 345 6.2.1.3.3.

Process Materiel Deficiency Returns IAW TO 00-35D-54. 6.2.2.2.1.  Maintenance  personnel  (originator)  delivers  the  deficient  exhibit  to  the LRS/Materiel Management Activity IAW TO 00-35D-54, specifically: 6.2.2.2.1.1.  A copy of the initial deficiency report (DR) submittal paperwork. 6.2.2.2.1.2.  Provide  documentation  for  DR  to  include  latent  defects  found  after initial exhibit reporting. 6.2.2.2.1.3.  Two  completed  copies  of  the  DD  Form  1575,  Suspended  Tag  –Materiel 6.2.2.2.1.4.  Two  copies  of  the  DD  Form  2332,  Product  Quality  Deficiency Report  Exhibit  properly  completed  IAW  TO  00-35D-54  with  the  deficient property at the time of return. 6.2.2.2.2.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  will  verify  maintenance  has provided  required  documentation  and  unserviceable  (ERRCD  X**)  item  returns  are identified with supply condition code Q and action taken code C. (T-1). 6.2.2.2.3.  Upon  completion  of  return  processing,  the  appropriate  ILS-S  produces management  notice  I012  (Stock  Awaiting  Disposition)  reflecting  the  unserviceable detail document number. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity will attach a copy of the I012 management notice to the property and write the Report Control Number (RCN) on the I012 so the exhibit can be readily identified. 6.2.2.2.4.  Move the exhibit to the deficiency report storage location. 6.2.2.2.5.  Assign location to R920 detail. 6.2.2.3.  Warranty Item Returns. Include all warranty paperwork when items are returned. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 347 6.2.2.4.  Items  Undergoing  Physical  Inventory.  Inventory  freeze  codes  (C  for  Cycle inventory and I for Special inventory) will not affect processing of unserviceable returns. Inventory freeze codes will have the following effects on serviceable return processing: 6.2.2.4.1.  When TEX code 7 or G is used to force shipment, the system will process the return and shipment of the property. 6.2.2.4.2.  When the entire quantity can be due-out released, the system will process the return and release the due-out. 6.2.2.4.3.  When neither of these conditions exist, reject 469 will be printed. Take the following actions: 6.2.2.4.3.1.  Hold copy 1 of the 469 reject in suspense and re-input the return after freeze code is removed. 6.2.2.4.3.2.  Forward copy 2 of the 469 reject to the holding area, where it will be attached to the property. 6.2.2.5.  Found on Base (FOB) Item Returns. Assets in the possession of base customers not accounted for on supply system due-in from maintenance or in-use equipment detail records are commonly referred to as found on base (FOB). 6.2.2.5.1.  Determine ownership. The following research actions are performed for all FOB  returns  to  determine  ownership:  Verify  all  warehouse  locations  and  detail balances;  review  transaction  history  for  previous  adjustments  to  validate  if  FOB  is related; and check Degraded Operations log sheets to verify all transactions have been processed.  After  research,  if  ownership  of  FOB  property  can  be  determined,  return the property to the owning organization. 6.2.2.5.2.  Specific  FOB  Actions.  The  FSC  documents  all  research  actions  and  files with  a  copy  of  the  D20  when  an  item  is  found  on  base.  Follow  actions  for Recoverable,  Consumable,  or  Equipment  Return  Procedures  and  process  the  return with TEX code “+”. Serialized control assets (i.e. NWRM, CCI/COMSEC, Weapons) or  classified  assets  need  to  follow  actions  identified  under  Table  6.2.  All  research actions  and/or  maintenance  documentation  will  be  filed  with  a  copy  of  the  D20 (BASE  SUPPLY  SURVEILLANCE  REPORT)  IAW  AFI  23-101  Chapter  5.  Use Table 6.2 for additional actions. 6.2.2.5.3.  Overages. Overages resulting from maintenance turn-ins due to scheduled weapon  system  deactivations  and  modifications  shall  be  considered  resolved discrepancies  when  maintenance  activities  provide  documentation  directing  the deactivations and or modifications as justification for resolution. The supply activity will  add  the  items  to  the  item  record  via  a  turn-in/receipt  transaction,  and documentation will be filed with Document Control IAW AFI 23-101 Chapter 5. For NWRM assets, notify the NTCC (635SCOW.NTCC@us.af.mil) prior to processing for accountability and disposition instructions. If documentation cannot be provided, the overages will be considered unresolved and the requirements prescribed in Table 6.2 will be followed. 6.2.2.5.4.  FSC  8150  Intermodal  (ISO)  Containers.  Contact  the  Air  Force  ISO Container Program  Manager at  HQ AFMC/A4RT to  request  disposition  instructions 348 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 for  ISO  containers  declared  FOB  on  AF  installations.  See  Defense  Transportation Regulation  (DTR)  4500.9-R,  Part  VI,  Management  and  Control  of  Intermodal Containers  and  System  463L  Equipment,  Chapter  602,  Intermodal  Container Procedures for ISOs found on installation." Table 6.2.  Exceptions to TEX code “+” Returns. Type Item Serialized control assets (i.e. NWRM, CCI/COMSEC and Weapons) or Classified Equipment (ERRC NF*/ND*). Actions These assets will not be turned-in with a TEX + (plus). Use Special Inventory procedures and customers will follow Report of Survey guidance in AFMAN 23-220. For NWRM, immediately contact the NTCC to determine proper accountability/disposition actions. Also see AFI 20-110, Ch 11 for discrepancy reporting requirements. If ownership can be determined, see chapter 5D for equipment processing procedures. 6.2.2.6.  Readiness Spares and Supply Point Item Returns. These assets are “returned” to retail  supply  stocks,  and  the  materiel  return  procedures  are  the  same  as  those  used  for customer  materiel  returns.  Use  the  activity  code,  Organization  Code,  Shop  Code  and serial number of the Readiness Spares or Supply Point detail for processing the return. 6.2.2.7.  Controlled Item and Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM) Returns. 6.2.2.7.1.  Write  or  stamp  CLASSIFIED  ITEM  in  red  ink  on  all  copies  of  classified item  source  documents.  For  NWRM  equipment,  stamp  the  AF  Form  2005  with CLASSIFIED NWRM Item in red ink. 6.2.2.7.2.  LRS/Materiel  Management  activities  will  research  and  verify  the  serial number and part number/stock number conversions for all controlled materiel turned-in  without  the  serial  number  or  national  stock  number  physically  identified  on  the item. 6.2.2.7.3.  Serialized Control Returns. When processing a return that affects the total on-hand  or  detail  quantity,  follow  normal  processing  procedures.  However,  if processing  a  transaction  for  a  partial  quantity,  specific  serial  numbers  must  be identified before the in-line transaction is processed. Use TRIC XHB or DSR detailed in COMSEC Serialized Control Input (XHB) and Small Arms Reconciliation Report For AFMC (DSR) respectively in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10. 6.2.2.7.4.  NWRM Returns. In addition to instructions in Section 6B NWRM returns will be processed using the following procedures: 6.2.2.7.4.1.  The  FSC  ensures  only  personnel  authorized  by  the  NWRMAO process NWRM return transactions. (T-1). 6.2.2.7.4.2.  FSC/return  processing  activities  will  notify  NTCC  of  processing actions when an NWRM is being returned. (T-1). 6.2.2.7.4.3.  The  FSC  provides  the  NTCC  the  NSN,  the  part  number,  document number, quantity, unit of issue, and applicable serial number(s). (T-1). 6.2.2.7.4.4.  The  NTCC  lifts  freeze  code  N  via  Freeze  Code  Update  (1FC) AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 349 processing, and notify the requesting FSC the freeze code has been removed. FSC will  process  the  TIN.  After  successful  processing,  NTCC  informs  IM/repair facility of pending shipment and reload the freeze code N. 6.2.2.7.4.5.  Do  NOT  process  returns  for  NWRM  with  a  TEX  7  and Supplementary  Address.  This  will  prevent  automatic  bypass  of  the  freeze  code. (T-1). 6.2.2.7.4.6.  When  return  processing  releases  to  a  backorder,  FSC  will  provide final  destination  detail  (SPRAM,  Equipment,  Supply  Point,  etc.)  of  the  asset(s). All  excess  POS  assets  will  be  redistributed  based  on  direction  from  the  Item Manager (IM). 6.2.2.7.4.7.  When  return  processing  released  to  an  unserviceable  hold  detail, contact  the  NTCC  to  process  a  Shipment  (SHP)  or  Wholesale  Activity Redistribution Order /Referral Order (A2x/A4x) to the correct address. 6.2.2.8.  Parachute Returns will be processed using equipment returns procedures detailed in Chapter 5, and the following procedures. 6.2.2.8.1.  Parachute  components  found  to  be  unserviceable  as  a  result  of  inspection performed IAW applicable technical orders will be processed as follows: 6.2.2.8.2.  Reparable  and  serviceable  parachutes  and  components  of  the  following stock  numbers,  which  are  excess  to  AF  requirements,  will  be  converted  to  training aids: 6.2.2.8.2.1.

Serviceable  components  will  be  turned  in  to  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity for stock or excess reporting to the IM for disposition instructions, to include year/date of manufacture and condition, when applicable. 6.2.2.8.4.  AFMC  will  assign  excess  exception  code  (EEX)  "6"  and  a  locally determined shipment exception (SEX) code, with exception notice code (ENC) of "R" for reject, with the SEX exception phrase reading: Online ship to FB4620 (RIC DL7), MF USAF Ground Survival School. "Do Not Post" shipments are prohibited. 350 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 6.2.2.8.5.  Prior  to  shipment,  materiel  management  personnel  will  ensure  the parachute  assemblies  are  conspicuously  stenciled  in  indelible  ink:  "NOT  FOR FLIGHT - GROUND TRAINING ONLY." (T-1). Unserviceable components may be stenciled during the technical order inspection performed by maintenance. 6.2.2.8.6.  Disassembled  Parachutes.  If  disassembling  parachutes,  EAE,  responsible custodian,  and  owning  activity  work  together  to  ensure  the  parachute  is  properly taken apart, identified and accounted for on separate DIFM details before taking it to the FSC. 6.2.2.8.7.  EAE  determines  what  parts  make  up  the  assembled  parachute  and  then prepare the documents listed below. Process these documents in the exact order listed. Note:  Although  these  documents  are  basically  "paperwork"  transactions,  output  DD Form 1348-1A will be distributed in the normal manner. 6.2.2.8.7.1.  Activity Code E Return (Assembled Parachute). This return transfers the  parachute  from  the  in-use  detail  to  the  item  record.  EAE  prepares  and processes  the  return  with  the  following  information:  Supply  condition  code  A; TEX  code  8;  and  PARCHUTDSAMBLY  in  positions  67-80.  When  necessary, prepare an FCI to adjust authorizations. 6.2.2.8.7.2.  Activity Code P Issue (Assembled Parachute). This issue removes the parachute  from  the  item  record  balance.  EAE  prepares  and  processes  the  issue with  the  following  information:  Activity  code  P;  organization  code  004;  shop code AD; and PARCHUTDSAMBLY in positions 67-80. 6.2.2.8.7.3.  Activity Code P Return (Parachute  Component). For each parachute component,  EAE  will  prepare  and  process  the  return  using  following  data: Activity  code  P;  organization  code  004;  shop  code  AD;  condition  code  A;  and TEX code 8. 6.2.2.8.7.4.  Activity  Code  C  Issue  (Parachute  Component).  For  every  activity code P return prepared for a component, EAE prepares and processes an activity code  C  issue.  In  positions  67-80,  enter  the  in-use  document  number  of  the parachute.  Use  the  disassembling  activity's  organization  and  shop  code  to establish DIFM control on component items. Note: The activity disassembling the parachute signs each activity code C issue. Other issues or returns are signed by EAE. 6.2.2.8.8.  Return  and  Disposition  of  Parachute  Components.  After  parachute components have been associated to a unique DIFM detail, the disassembling activity returns any serviceable, reparable, or condemned parachute components to the FSC. 6.2.2.9.  Return  of  Bench  Mockups  or  Sets.  The  equipment  custodian  must  state disassembly is complete when returning a bench mockup or set. Follow equipment return procedures using activity code E, for returns of each component of the mockup or set. 6.2.2.10.  Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM). Returns for SPRAM items must contain demand code I (when reducing or deleting authorized detail) or demand code R (when requesting replacement item). AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 351 6.2.2.11.  Safe and Filing Cabinet Returns. Return documents for safes and filing cabinets with  combination  locks  will  include  combination  settings.  When  locksmith  services  are available, the combination settings will be changed to  50-25-50 prior to  return. When a locksmith  is  unavailable,  returns  may  be  accomplished  without  changing  combination settings.  If so, in  addition  to  writing the settings on the return document also  notate the combination on the tag or label attached to the safe or cabinet. 6.2.2.12.  Multiple DIFM Indicator. When using a multiple DIFM indicator, there is only one DIFM document number. Additional processing will be required if returning partial quantities  or  using  separate  conditions.  Example:  DIFM  quantity  is  10.  When  returning five each with an action taken code 9 and the other five with an action taken code B, it will be necessary to process separate returns with the same document number. 6.2.2.13.  Non-accountable  equipment.  Non-accountable  equipment  GPC  purchased items  must  be  processed  through  the  ILS-S  to  ensure  the  assets  are  not  on  any accountable records. Process returns for non-EAID equipment items that do not affect in-use  detail  records.  The  requester  provides  the  org/shop  code.  Materiel  Management personnel will process the return using: 6.2.2.13.1.  Activity code “P” document numbers. 6.2.2.13.2.  Activity code “K” from retail outlets. 6.2.2.13.3.  Credit  code  “N”.  Note:  Credit  code  “Y”  is  assigned  when  credit  is allowed,  the  Funds  manager  must  approve  the  use  of  credit  code  “Y”  before processing 6.2.2.13.4.  Contact EAE for items on EAID details 6.2.2.14.  AFREP: 6.2.2.14.1.  Unserviceable  XF  returns  will  be  placed  in  the  designated  hold  area  by FSC for one duty day to give AFREP time to  determine reparability. When AFREP does not respond in one duty day, return will be processed as normal. 6.2.2.14.2.  When AFREP can repair the asset,  a  TIN will be processed with a TEX code "1" to clear the original DIFM detail. 6.2.2.14.2.1.  Process  an  unserviceable  issue  (MSI)  with  a  TEX  code  "D"  to  the AFREP  account.  Use  activity  code  "C"  for  ERRC  XD  and  XF  budget  code  8 (MSD), and "R" for  XB and XF budget  code 9 (GSD) and use shop code "GF". This will provide the asset to AFREP as a "free issue" while establishing a DIFM detail. Refer to AFMAN 23-122, Chapter 5. 6.2.2.14.2.2.  Submit request to AFMC to assign local ERRC of XF for XB items with recurring initiatives that have a demand level established IAW AFH 23-123 V2 Pt2, Chp 8. 6.2.2.14.3.  Serviceable/Unserviceable  returns  from  AFREP  repair  shops  will  be processed for credit IAW AFI 23-101, Chapter 2. (T-1). 6.2.3.  Recoverable, Consumable, or Equipment Return Procedures. 352 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 6.2.3.1.  Purpose:  To  provide  procedures  on  the  return  of  recoverable,  consumable,  or equipment items. For policy specific requirements review, AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 6.2.3.2.  In  addition  to  guidance  in  this  chapter,  follow  instructions  in  subsequent paragraphs for recoverable (ERRCD XD2 or XF3), consumable (ERRCD XB*/NF1), or equipment (ERRCD N**) returns to the ILS-S. 6.2.3.3.  Recoverable  Item  Returns.  Return  recoverable  items  after  completing  the  base repair  cycle  process  IAW  TO  00-20-9,  Forecasting  Replacement  Requirements  for Selected  Calendar  and  Hourly  Time  Change  Items.  In  addition,  all  recoverable  returns will follow procedures in Sec 6B and recoverable return transaction processing outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6. 6.2.3.4.  Consumable  Item  Return  Procedures.  In  addition  to  Sec  6B  and  consumable return processing outlined in Processing Turn-In of Consumable Items AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6 perform the following actions for all consumable item returns: 6.2.3.4.1.  AFI  23-101  and  DoD  4160.21-M  mandates  all  government  materiel  must be  fully  used  and  reused  whenever  it  can  be  effectively,  economically,  and  safely utilized.  Although  activities  or  work  centers  may  no  longer  need  consumable  assets for  current  needs,  they  are  not  authorized  to  automatically  throw  away  these  items because they may be needed in the future. The following general guidelines will help determine item usefulness and applies to both on and off-base organizations. 6.2.3.4.2.  Throw Away Items. Customers may only throw away items that are in such a  deteriorated  condition  they  cannot  be  sold  through  DLADS,  thus  making  them useless  for  any  future  application.  Examples  are  used  gaskets,  seals,  broken  plastic items, etc. 6.2.3.4.3.  Useful  materiel.  Customers  will  collect,  retain,  and  return  to  the LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  all  consumable items,  serviceable  or unserviceable,  having  potential  use  or  resale  value.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity will reissue and redistribute these for repair and reuse, or transfer to DLADS as scrap. (T-1). 6.2.3.4.4.  The return activity prepares and signs the applicable DD Form 1500 series tag/label. The return activity will write appropriate organization and shop code on the applicable DD Form or the property container. The DD Form 1574 is not required on a serviceable  consumable item  if the item  is  in  its original sealed container, and the national stock number has not been removed or obliterated. 6.2.3.4.5.  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  will  not  accept  serviceable  property less than a full Unit of Issue (UI). (T-3). When returned serviceable property contains less than a full UI (i.e., 57 EA and the UI is HD), the organization will keep the items as work order residue or add them to existing bench stock. 6.2.4.  Specific Consumable Processing Procedures. 6.2.4.1.  Purpose:  To  provide  procedures  on  certain  consumable  returns.  For  policy specific requirements review, AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 353 6.2.4.2.  IAW  AFI  24-301,  Vehicle  Operations  will  incorporate  collection/pickup  into their  documented  cargo  sweeps,  according  to  the  schedule  set  by  the  LRS.  They  will deliver recovered consumable materiel to FSC for processing. (T-1). 6.2.4.3.  Use the organization and shop code identified on the DD Form 1574 or container to  make  sure  funds  credit  is  provided  when  authorized.  Property  suspected  to  be unserviceable  or  misidentified  will  be  verified  by  a  certified  inspector.  Process unserviceable  returns  as  condition  code  “H.”  When  items  are  considered  scrap,  process IAW  Sec.  6C,  of  this  manual.  After  processing,  move  materiel  to  applicable  hold location. 6.2.5.  Equipment Return Procedures. 6.2.5.1.  Purpose:  To  provide  procedures  on  the  return  of  recoverable,  consumable,  or equipment items. For policy specific requirements review, AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 6.2.5.2.  In  addition  to  Sec.  6B  and  equipment  return  processing  outlined  in  Processing Turn-In  of  Equipment  Items  To  ILS-S,  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  6  the  following actions are performed for all equipment returns: 6.2.5.3.  The  organization  equipment  custodian  will  contact  EAE  to  request  return  of accountable equipment items. Additionally, the custodian will prepare two copies of AF Form 2005 for return processing. (T-2). 6.2.5.4.  The EAE: 6.2.5.4.1.  Reviews the equipment custodian’s AF Form 2005 for accuracy. 6.2.5.4.2.  Queries the ILS-S to identify unfilled base authorizations for the item. 6.2.5.4.2.1.  Unfilled base authorizations: 6.2.5.4.2.1.1.  When a due-out exists, EAE contacts the customer to verify the item returned will be acceptable to their requirements. If so, ensure the correct document number is annotated on AF Form 2005 used for return with TEX 2. 6.2.5.4.2.1.2.  If  no  due-out  exists,  EAE  transfers  the  serviceable  item  to  the existing base authorization. 6.2.5.4.2.1.3.  When  there  are  no  base  requirements,  the  FSC  processes  the TIN  to  stock  which  allows  item  manager  visibility  VIA  the  FTE  process  for potential redistribution. 6.2.5.5.  Documented  Cargo  Operations  is  responsible  to  pick  up  the  property  from custodian.  Custodians  ensure  that  items  contain  proper  documentation  prior  to  pick  up. Proper  documentation  includes:  AFTO  Form  350,  Reparable  Item  Processing  Tag  (if applicable), and condition tag. When an item is missing required packaging, an AF Form 451, Request for Packing Service, will be included with the property. Documented Cargo will  initial  the  AF  Form  2005  and  leave  a  copy  with  the  custodian.  Documented  Cargo personnel  are  not  responsible  for  the  inspection  or  completion  of  documentation.  They will  deliver  the  property  and  remaining  AF  Form  2005  copies  to  FSC  for  Return transaction  processing  IAW  Chapter  6.  FSC  personnel  will  take  delivery  of  items  and 354 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 coordinate with the owning unit for discrepancies with packaging and/or documentation. (T-1). Section 6C—Disposal, Demilitarization and Precious Metals Recovery Program (PMRP) 6.3.  Disposal, and Demilitarization. 6.3.1.  Disposal. 6.3.1.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  disposal  procedures  process  required  to  transfer  materiel (TRM) to DLADS for managing excess and surplus materiel transfers. Materiel transfers from  AF  retail  materiel  management  activities  to  DLA  can  be  either  directed  by wholesale  inventory  control  point  (ICP)  item  managers,  or  can  be  initiated  based  upon enterprise  disposal  decisions  by  AFMC  only.  For  policy  specific  requirements  review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 6.3.1.2.  Overarching disposal guidance is contained in DoD 4160.21M. 6.3.1.3.  General  Disposal  Procedures. AFMC-directed materiel  transfers to  DLADS  are processed  in  the  ILS-S  when  items  are  no  longer  required  (excess)  and  all  disposal authority  criteria  has  been  met.  The  following  actions  will  be  performed  for  all  items being  transferring  to  DLADS  through  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  channels. Reference AFI 23-101 for disposal authority criteria. 6.3.1.3.1.  Identify  the  type  of  property  for  disposal  by  checking  NSN  and/or  Part Number. Reference AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6 for clarification. 6.3.1.3.2.  Ensure all the paperwork if applicable, is complete (e.g. hazardous forms, disposition instructions, and condition tags with property). 6.3.1.3.3.  Input  of  an  AFMC-directed  materiel  transfer,  the  ILS-S  applies  transfer disposal authority criteria to ensure the materiel qualifies for transfer. The transaction format and processing instructions for transferring items are provided at AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6.. 6.3.1.3.4.

For  Critical  Safety  Items  (CSI)  materiel  which  lacks  required  supporting documentation  will  be  mutilated  prior  to  being  transferred.  The  term  “AFTO  Form  95 Required”  will  be  printed  on  all  output  shipments  or  transfer  documents  requiring supporting  historical  maintenance  data.  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  inspector should contact maintenance when this phrase is printed on serialized reparable items and no maintenance documentation is available. 6.3.1.4.1.  A  criticality  code  of  “E”  or  “F”  identifies  an  item  as  CSI,  in  IAW  DoD 4100.39 10, http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/410039m/410039m_vol 10.pdf. Vol M, 6.3.1.4.2.  DLADS  will  mutilate  CSIs  not  accompanied  by  an  AFTO  Form  95  or other historical maintenance record, and if the items have not already been mutilated. 6.3.1.4.3.  When  disposing  such  aviation  CSIs  into  DLA,  ensure  that  the  documents clearly  annotate  that  the  part  is  "defective,"  "non-reparable,"  or  "time-expired"  and that mutilation is required. Note: When the materiel is new/unused and still packaged in  the  original  manufacturer’s  container  that  reflects  all  of  the  identification  and contracting  data,  the  item  shall  be  issued  or  turned-in  to  DLA  without  applying  the mutilation requirement. 6.3.1.4.4.  CSIs  that  contain  military  offensive  or  defensive  capabilities  shall  be demilitarized IAW DoD 4160.28-M. 6.3.1.5.  Disposal  of  Special  Access  Program  parts  will  comply  with  AFI  16-701, Management, Administration and Oversight of Special Access Programs. 6.3.2.  Disposal Return Document (DTID). 6.3.2.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  Disposal  Return  Document/materiel  transfer  procedures used  by  base  organizations  to  process  directly  to  DLADS.  For  policy  specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 6.3.2.2.  These procedures are primarily used to transfer scrap to DLA by authorized base organizations.  Since  organizational  transfers  of  materiel  to  DLADS  are  not  processed through the ILS-S, the initiating organizations are responsible for hand scribed or typed DD  Form  1348-1A  documenting  the  transfer.  There  are  two  methods  available  for producing  the  documentation.  Organizations  will  use  DLA’s  Electronic  Turn-in Document (ETID) system or manually produce the transfer shipment documentation if IT is limited. 6.3.2.3.  General  Disposal  Procedures.  Property  shall  be  turned  in  to  the  DLADS  Site IAW  DLM  4000.25-1-M,  and  DoD  4160.21-M,  Ch  3  all  returns  will  be  on  DD  Form 1348-1A. 6.3.2.3.1.  Segregate  scrap  materiel  to  minimize  DLA  handling  costs  and  to  ensure maximum  returns  from  the  sale  of  disposed  materiel.  Segregation  of  scrap  materiel shall be accomplished by the base organizations initiating materiel for all transfers. 6.3.2.3.2.  When  purchased items  using  Government  Purchase  Card  (GPC), organization will contact LRS/Materiel Management Activity to ensure the assets are not on any accountable records. For “Scrap Materiel,” organization will make every effort possible to return the items directly to DLADS. 356 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 6.3.2.3.3.

When an ETID is prepared by an IM to process excesses at more than one storage  location,  separate  forms  will  be  prepared  for  each  location.  Each  form  will contain  indicative  information  for  the  property  held  only  at  that  location.  Ensure quantity to be transferred and retention quantity entries are complete. 6.3.3.  Batch Lot Processing. 6.3.3.1.  Purpose:  To  explain  the  batch  lot  procedures.  For  policy  specific  requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 6.3.3.2.  In some cases, bases are authorized to transfer useable low dollar value materiel to  DLADS  in  “batch  lots”  instead  of  individual  stock  number  (item)  transfers.  Note: Batch lotted property documents are not in Web Docs and will be mailed back. Reference DoD 4160.21-M, Ch 3 above for more information. 6.3.3.3.  General  batch  lot  procedures.  Property  shall  be  collected  in  a  standard  tri-wall container or other suitable container but must not exceed the dimension of a standard box pallet.  Place  containers  in  a  convenient  location  within  each  warehouse  and  when  the container  is  full  or  the  warehouse  supervisor  considers  it  desirable,  an  ETID  will  be prepared and the container forwarded to the DLADS.

For  policy  specific requirements review AFI 23-101 and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123. 6.3.4.2.  Demilitarization  of  selected  items  must  be  performed  by  the  disposing  activity prior to  transfer to  preclude the unauthorized use of military items; destroy the military advantages  inherent  in  certain  types  of  property;  render  dangerous  property  harmless; AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 357 protect the national interest; and preclude the compromise of security requirements IAW DoD 4160.28M, V2. 6.3.4.3.  General DEMIL Procedures: The following actions are performed: 6.3.4.3.1.  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  inspection  personnel  will  contact  IM personnel  to  obtain  guidance  when  DEMIL  codes on DD  Form 1348-1As appear to be incorrect or cannot be determined. (T-1). When an IM cannot be identified, contact DLADs IAW DoD 4160.21-M. 6.3.4.3.1.1.  When  inspection  personnel  detect  incorrect  demilitarization  codes, they  forward  documents  showing  the  changed  demilitarization  requirement  to Records Maintenance, who will resolve the coding conflict. 6.3.4.3.2.  For items assigned DEMIL code F, Inspection is responsible for initiating correspondence to obtain demilitarization instructions from the IM/ICP. 6.3.4.3.2.1.  Inspection  personnel  informs  Central  Storage  to  segregate  and/or mark property destined for shipment pending response from the IM/ICP. 6.3.4.3.3.  For  items  assigned  DEMIL  code  G  before  they  can  be  transferred: Inspection  is  responsible  for  monitoring  demilitarization,  subsequent  transfer,  and related documentation. 6.3.4.3.3.1.  Inspection  personnel  coordinates  with  the  following  activities  to establish a point of contact for carrying out demilitarization: 6.3.4.3.3.1.1.  Munitions  Maintenance  and/or  Armament  Maintenance,  for ammunition and explosives. 6.3.4.3.3.1.2.

Inspection personnel  hold  this copy in  suspense until  the  demilitarized  property  and/or  related  documentation  have  been  returned. They then destroy copy 8. the  demilitarization  accepts 6.3.4.3.6.  The activity demilitarizing the item completes the certification as follows: 6.3.4.3.6.1.  If,  after  demilitarization,  the  property  retains  its  original  identity (only key points have been demilitarized), the certifying agent specifies 1) that the item  has  been  demilitarized,  2)  that  there  is  residual  materiel,  and  3)  that  such materiel has not been downgraded to scrap. The certifying agent then returns the residual property and related documentation to the LRS, who then ships it to the DLADS. 6.3.4.3.6.2.  When, after demilitarization, the property does not retain its original identity  (it  has  been  crushed  or  destroyed),  the  certifying  agent  specifies  1)  that the  item  has  been  demilitarized,  2)  that  there  is  or  is  not  residual  materiel  of salable quality, and 3) that such materiel has been downgraded to scrap or waste. 6.3.4.3.6.2.1.  When  the  residual  materiel  is  of  salable  quality,  the  certifying agent circles the stock number in print positions 8-22 of the DD Form 1348-1A,  enters  the  word  SCRAP,  and  returns  the  residual  materiel  and  related documentation to Supply for later shipment to the DLADS. 6.3.4.3.6.2.2.  When  the  residual  materiel  is  not  of  salable  quality,  the  agent circles  the  stock  number  in  print  positions  8-22  of  the  DD  Form  1348-1A, enters the word WASTE, and returns ONLY the documentation to LRS. 6.3.4.3.6.3.  When,  after  demilitarization,  there  is  no  residual  materiel  (as  in explosives),  the  agent  certifies  1)  that  the  item  has  been  demilitarized,  2)  that there  is  no  residual  materiel  of  salable  quality,  and  3)  that  the  residual  materiel has  been  downgraded  or  destroyed.  The  agent  then  circles  the  stock  number  in print  positions  8-22  of  the  DD  Form  1348-1A,  enters  the  word  DESTROYED, and returns the documentation to LRS. shipping  documents  containing  a 6.3.4.3.7.

The  following  actions  will  be  performed  for  all base level MMHS/SAS requests: 7.2.1.3.  Requirements  Call.  Annually,  AFMC  performs  a  requirements  call  requesting final  validation  of  all  upcoming  fiscal  year  projects  and  submission  of  new  projects. MAJCOM  Program  Managers  receive  the  requirements  call  data.  New  and  updated concept papers are required for each project identified during the requirements call. 7.2.1.3.1.  Concept  Paper.  New  MMHS/SAS  projects  require  a  concept  paper. Projects will not be budgeted without a current concept paper. The concept paper is a one  page  summary  of  deficiencies  and  requested  improvements.  It  contains  specific background  information,  requested  improvements,  present  system(s),  anticipated benefits/impact  and base point of contact.

Section 7C—Supply Chain Materiel Management System 7.3.  Supply  Chain  Materiel  Management  System.  The  Supply  Chain  Materiel  Management System Section covers system interfaces and reject management. 7.3.1.  Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS) Interface. 7.3.1.1.  Purpose:  This  section  provides  the  procedures  and  identifies  the  processes required  for  the  ILS-S  and  the  CMOS  interface.  Following  a  brief  explanation  of  the SBSS and CMOS interface, the specific procedures and processes are identified. 7.3.1.1.1.  SBSS/CMOS  Interface.  The  SBSS/CMOS interface  establishes  an electronic  interface  between  the  SBSS  and  base  transportation  activities.  The interface  provides  base  transportation  organizations  with  timely  data  to  effectively plan  and  schedule  shipments  into  the  transportation  pipeline,  to  control  shipment limits  to  maximize  the  use  of  transportation  resources,  and  to  reduce  transportation costs.  In  addition,  it  allows  transportation  to  preplan  shipment  consolidation  and selects  the  mode  of  shipment  based  on  priority.  CMOS  provides  electronic  record images to the SBSS when transportation receives outbound cargo, and it continues to provide  shipment  status  information  to  the  SBSS  until  the  cargo  is  released  for shipment.  The  SBLC  ICI  is  the  primary  mechanism  used  to  pass  messages  and transactions between the ADS. 7.3.1.2.  General Procedures. 7.3.1.2.1.  Responsibilities. 7.3.1.2.1.1.  AFMC.  The  Records  Maintenance  Activity  is  responsible  for ensuring an ADS-Interface Record is loaded, see ADS-Interface Record, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 6 for transaction format. 7.3.1.2.1.2.  Satellite Accounts. Satellite accounts are responsible for coordinating the  load  of  the  CMOS  indicator  with  AFMC  to  establish  the  SBSS/CMOS interface. 7.3.1.2.2.  Material Management IT system processes. 7.3.1.2.2.1.  Acknowledgment  of  Receipt.  The  SBSS/CMOS  interface  eliminates the  requirement  for  a  signature  on  the  shipment  documents  processed  from  the SBSS  to  base  transportation.  Base  transportation  acknowledges  receipt  of  a shipment  to  the  SBSS  with  an  electronic  image  of  a  shipment  suspense  record from  the  CMOS  which  updates  the  shipped  not  credited  detail  (SNC).  It  also updates the shipment suspense detail (SSC) with an inchecker code and inchecked date.  Note:  When  the  CMOS  flag  is  loaded,  document  control  cards  (DCC)  are not produced for shipment documents except for classified items. See Sec. 5E, of this manual for more information on document control procedures for shipments both with and without CMOS interface. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 365 7.3.1.2.2.2.  Directed  and  Nondirected  Shipments.  The  SBSS  provides  CMOS with  an  electronic  image  of  a  shipment  interface  record  for  all  outbound shipments. This record contains the shipping information printed on the DD Form 1348-1A  which  provides  the  CMOS  with  all  the  transportation  data  required  to incheck  materiel  and  process  outbound  cargo  (see  SBSS-to-CMOS  Shipment Interface  Records,  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  7).  Note:  When  the  collocated activity option is  used,  a shipment  interface record is  not  provided to  CMOS.  A document control card (DCC) is produced. 7.3.1.2.2.3.  Transfer  to  DLADS.  When  transportation  channels  are  used  to transport  property  transfers  to  DLADS,  the  SBSS  provides  CMOS  with  an electronic image of a shipment  interface  record, see SBSS-TO-CMOS  Shipment Interface  Records,  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  7.  When  the  LRS/Materiel Management Activity makes the delivery to DLADS, a shipment interface record is  not  provided  to  CMOS.  See  SBSS-TO-CMOS  Shipment  Interface  Records, AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  7  for  loading  a  DRMO-TMO  delivery  flag  to  the OCCR.  (Note:  Delivery  flag  still  uses  old  office  symbol  identifiers,  i.e.  not DLADs or Cargo Movement). 7.3.1.2.2.4.  Off-Base Issues. When materiel is routed to an off-base organization through the base transportation office, the SBSS provides an electronic image of the shipment interface record to the CMOS for issues and due-out releases (TRICs ISU, BSU, MSI, and DOR). 7.3.1.2.2.5.  Reverse-Post Processing. When a directed or non-directed shipment, transfer to DLADS, or off-base issue is processed through the base transportation office and is reverse-posted, the SBSS provides an electronic image of a Record Reversal Record to the CMOS (see Record Reversal Record, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 7). 7.3.1.2.2.6.  Follow-up  Processing.  An  electronic  image  of  a  Follow-up  Action Record  (see  Follow-up  Action  Record,  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  7)  is provided  to  CMOS  when  a  receipt  of  acknowledgment,  inchecker  code  and inchecker date for an off-base shipment, transfer to DLADS, or off-base issue is not received by the SBSS in a timely manner. The first follow-up occurs when the inchecker code and inchecker date in the SSC or SNC detail is blank and the date of  last  transaction  is  older  than  5  days.  When  a  response  is  not  received  from CMOS, a second follow-up occurs when the date of last transaction is older than 10 days. 7.3.1.2.2.7.  The  ES-S  Delinquent  Outbound  Shipment  process  lists  SSC/SNC details  with  a  blank  inchecker  code/inchecked  date.  This  capability  focuses  on ensuring  outbound  shipments  are  planned,  packaged  and  executed  by  Cargo Movement  personnel  within  the  standard  timeframes.  This  report  provides management with a list of off-base shipments, transfers to DLADS, and off-base issues  processed the  Base  Transportation  Office  when  a  receipt  of acknowledgment,  inchecker  number,  and  inchecker  date  have  not  been  received from  CMOS.  Refer  to  the  ES-S  User’s  Manual,  Chapter  17,  for  more information. to 366 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 7.3.2.

Purpose:  To  provide  the  procedures  and  identify  the  processes  required  for  the Material Management IT system interface with IMDS CDB and CAMS-FM/G081. 7.3.2.2.  Implementation  of  these  processes  does  not  change  the  current  organizational structure. 7.3.2.3.  Only  selected  transactions  are  permitted  to  be  processed  from  a  maintenance work  center  terminal.  In  IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM,  maintenance  personnel  have  the capability  to  order  parts,  cancel  their  own  requirements,  retrieve  current  status,  and review canceled requirements through remote terminals located in the work center area. 7.3.2.4.  Manual operations will be used if the interface is suspended for long periods of time. 7.3.2.5.  Software. The SBLC  ICI is  the primary  mechanism used to  pass messages and transactions between the ADS. 7.3.2.6.  IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM  Implementation.  Ensure  the  following  actions  are accomplished prior to IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM activation: 7.3.2.6.1.  Validate and update those SRDs that the IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM unit will use to ensure they are loaded in the SBSS SRD table (008 record). See SRD Inquiry, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for the input/output format of SRD Inquiry. 7.3.2.6.2.  Validate  and  update  the  IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM  organization  record  to ensure  the  IMDS  CDB-GANG-NBR  (the  gang  number  they  will  be  using  for  their inputs) and the 518-Maint-Unit-Ident-Code are loaded. See OCCR, Load, Change, or Delete,  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  8  for  the  Organization  Cost  Center  Record Load/Change/Delete/Inquiry format and entry requirements. 7.3.2.6.3.  Use  The  ADS  Interface  Record  handler  to  establish  the  SBSS/  IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM interface. The information required for this screen consists of IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM  gang  number,  their  host  system  ID,  and  of  course,  the  SBSS information  as well. See ADS-Interface Record,  AFH 23-123,  Vol 2, Pt  1, Ch 7 for the format. 7.3.2.7.  IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM Activation/Deactivation. 7.3.2.7.1.  To activate IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM contact the ICI Monitor at the DMC to ensure  that  the  ICI  authorization  file  can  accommodate  proper  SBSS/IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM  gang  number  correlation  and  that  the  SBSS  host-ID  and  IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM host-ID are correct. 7.3.2.7.2.  To  deactivate  IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM  interface,  process  ADS  Interface Record  to  delete  IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM  interface  record.

The  outputs  from  SBSS  to  IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM are in the form of due-out status notifications, management notices, and reject notices. 7.3.2.9.1.  Due-Out  Status  Notifications.  The  SBSS  uses  this  transaction  to  notify IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM  of  a  change  in  status  for  a  due-out  asset  requested  by maintenance.  IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM  uses  the  data  contained  in  the  notification  to update  the  status  fields  in  IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM  systems.  (See  Due-Out  Status Notification (1SH) Transaction Format, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5 for the 1SH format and an explanation of the different status codes.) 7.3.2.9.2.  Management  Notices.  For  each  issue  transaction  submitted  (whether  it  is through  IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM  or  the  SBSS  input  terminal),  the  SBSS  returns  an I004  to  update  the  status  fields  in  the  supply  data  record  maintained  on  the  IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM  system  (except  manual  TEX  ‘6’  issues  or  issues  from  a  supply point).  Other  management  notices  sent  to  IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM  include  the  I005, I006, I023, and I122, see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7). Management notices sent to IMDS CDB/CAMSFM determines possible routing to other specified output terminals. IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM  are  displayed  on terminal. the input 368 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 7.3.2.9.3.  Reject  Notices.  When  SBSS  software  detects  an  error  in  a  transaction image  sent  by  IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM,  the  image  is  returned  to  the  IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM  input  terminal  along  with  the  applicable  reject  notice.  IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM  then  determines  possible  routing  to  other  output  terminals.  Note: Reject notices for IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM J activity code are not cumulative and do not adhere to normal materiel management procedures governing delinquency. 7.3.2.10.  Interface  Failure  Contingencies.  Use  the  following  procedures  when  one  or more of the following interface components is inactive. 7.3.2.10.1.  IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM Active - ICI Active - SBSS Inactive. 7.3.2.10.1.1.  ISU  Transactions.  IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM  will  reject  all  ISU transactions entered by Maintenance for transmission to the SBSS for processing. The  transaction  image  input  and  a  message  will  be  returned  to  the  IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM  terminal  that  input  the  transaction.  The  message  will  indicate that  the  SBSS  is  unavailable  for  processing,  and  off-line  processing  procedures must be used until the SBSS again becomes active. to  SBSS  Transactions.  All 7.3.2.10.1.2.  IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM  to  SBSS  transactions,  except  issues,  will  be  placed  in  an  ICI hold file pending later processing. It is conceivable, though not probable, that the ICI  file  could  fill  to  capacity.  Should  that  occur,  all  subsequent  IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM  to  SBSS  transactions  will  reject  back  to  the  input  IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM terminal with an explanation message. 7.3.2.10.2.  IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM Active - ICI Inactive - SBSS Active or Inactive. IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM  will  reject  all  transactions  entered  by  maintenance  for transmission  to  the  SBSS.  The  transaction  image  and  a  message  will  be  returned  to the  IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM  terminal  that  input  the  transaction.  The  message  will indicate  that  ICI  is  unavailable  for  processing  and  off-line  processing  procedures must be used until the electronic interface is reactivated. Contact AFMC to determine if ICI can be activated. 7.3.2.10.3.  IMDS  CDB/CAMS-FM  Inactive  -  ICI Active or  Inactive  - SBSS Active or  Inactive.  The  maintenance  facility  will  use  off-line  procedures  until  the  IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM becomes active and the electronic interface is reactivated. 7.3.2.10.4.  Off-line Procedures for Critically Needed Assets. 7.3.2.10.4.1.  Maintenance  sends  the  required  information  to  process  the  issue transaction  to  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity.  This  information  must include the ID code of the requesting IMDS CDB/CAMS-FM unit and the entire 12-position job control number. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity creates a document  number  for  the  requested  asset  using  the  normal  J  document  numbers and starting with  a daily serial  number of 8000-8999 for  IMDS  CDB  and 9000-9999 for CAMS-FM. 7.3.2.10.4.2.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  processes  the  issue,  if  the SBSS is active. 7.3.2.10.4.2.1.  The  SBSS  will  either  issue  or  kill  the  request.  LRS/Materiel AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 369 Management  Activity  then  notifies  Maintenance  of  the  action  taken  and requests verification when a kill  action occurs. Supply and Maintenance  will use  the  information  on  the  I023  management  notice  to  determine  how  the request will be satisfied. 7.3.2.10.4.3.  When  the  SBSS  is  not  active,  supply  will  initiate  current  manual procedures  to  issue  the  required  asset.  When  the  SBSS  is  reactivated,  the LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  will  process  the  issues  using  degraded operations procedures. 7.3.3.  Reject Management. 7.3.3.1.  Purpose:  Describe  the  general  procedures  associated  with  managing  rejects associated  with  materiel  management  transactions.  For  policy  specific  requirements review AFI 23-101; for roles and responsibilities of reject management see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7, and for ES-S specific guidance refer to the ES-S User’s Manual, Ch 24. 7.3.3.1.1.  ES-S  Reject  Management  is  the  preferred  method  for  managing  materiel management rejects. ES-S provides a capability to manage all suspended rejects (not just  those  processed  through  ES-S).  This  capability  is  designed  to  replace  the  reject management  processor  that  requires  users  to  sign-on  into  the  SBSS  in  the  Demand mode. Rejects in ES-S may be managed for a single base or across the enterprise. See the ES-S user’s manual for use of ES-S Reject Management. 7.3.3.1.1.1.  Cumulative Reject Processor may be used as a secondary tool when ES-S is not available or until access to the ES-S Reject Management function is established. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7. Section 7D—LRS / Materiel Management Activity ADP Personnel Requirements 7.4.  Overview.  This  section  outlines  the  procedures  for  selecting,  training,  and  maintaining proficiency of AFMC and DMC satellite operators. 7.5.  Training. 7.5.1.  The  continuing  availability  of  trained,  qualified  AFMC  and  DMC  satellite  operators depends  upon  the  care  and  attention  given  to  the  training  of  those  selected  and  the maintenance of proficiency. The criteria used are discussed in the paragraphs that follow: 7.5.2.  Except as explained in paragraphs below, it is mandatory that airmen basics, civilian employees  and  retrainees  selected  as  AFMC  operators  successfully  complete  the  formal Supply Systems Specialist Course prior to operating the standard AFMC and satellite DMC terminal  functions.  A  formal  request  for  a  quota  to  the  training  course  will  be  submitted immediately  upon  selection  of  the  individual  for  operator  duty.  On  the  Job  Training  (OJT) will  begin  upon  assignment  to  Computer  Operations.  The  training  will  consist  of  all  tasks outlined in JTS 2S032, except those involving AFMC operator duties. 7.5.3.  The following training conditions apply unless restricted by the MAJCOM: 7.5.3.1.  Personnel  selected  as  AFMC  operators  and  scheduled  to  attend  the  Supply Systems  Specialist  Course  may  operate  AFMC  and/or  satellite  DMC  input/output 370 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 functions  under  carefully  supervised  conditions  before  completion  of  the  mandatory course. 7.5.3.2.  SBSS input/output functions are currently utilized for two general applications: (1) as communications equipment for satellites of the Standard Base Supply System, and (2) as terminal functions in Receiving, Demand Processing, etc., at larger bases instead of terminals. The amount of training required for each application is different. 7.5.3.2.1.  For  SBSS  input/output  functions  used  to  support  satellites  of  the  SBSS, operators may be trained by OJT and may possess a 2S071 AFSC. Parent commands should  ensure  that  at  least  two  personnel  are  assigned  that  have  been  provided familiarization  training  on  this  ADPE.  OJT  training  provided  to  2S071  AFSC personnel will suffice for familiarization training. 7.5.3.2.2.  For SBSS input/output functions used as terminal functions within the LRS CC/AO organization, operators may be trained by OJT and may have a 2S071 AFSC. 7.5.3.2.3.  To  ensure  continuation  of  proficiency,  participation  is  a  minimum  of  1 work week to  include  a  complete normal  end-of-month. Hands on AFMC operation are  required  semiannually  for  personnel  in  the  grade  of  E-6  (TSgt)  and  below,  not performing the duty. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 371 Chapter 8 LOGISTICS PROGRAMS AND SYSTEMS Section 8A—Overview 8.1.  Overview.  This  chapter  outlines  AF  guidance  for  performing  tasks  associated  with logistics  programs  and  systems  regarding  Cataloging  and  Records  Maintenance;  Uniform Materiel Movement  and  Issue Priority System  (UMMIPS); AF Uniform  Clothing Policy;  Price Challenge  and  Verification  Program;  Disposition  of  Critical  Safety  Items  (CSI);  and  the  AF Reports  of  Survey  Program.  DoD  4100.39-M,  and,  DoDM  4140.01  serve  as  primary  DoD reference sources. Sec 8B. 8.2.  Cataloging  and  Records  Maintenance.  Cataloging  and  Records  Maintenance  describes the general  procedures associated with  cataloging and records maintenance. For policy specific requirements review AFI 23-101, Sec. 8B, and for IT specific guidance use AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8. 8.2.1.  Loading and Changing Item and Part Number Records. 8.2.1.1.  Purpose:  Describe  the  procedures  required  for  loading  and  changing  item  and part number records. 8.2.1.2.  AFMC and LRS Customer Support Liaison functions process and update records for all items managed in the ILS-S. The LRS or AFMC can load item records however, Customer  Support  Liaison  will  load  item  records  when  base  customers  are  unable  to process their own item record loads. (T-2). 8.2.1.3.  AFMC and  LRS Customer Support  Liaison  are responsible for  the accuracy of the transactions they process. 8.2.1.4.  See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt  2, Ch 8 for  applicable  ILS-S processes for loading item records and for loading, changing, and deleting part number detail records. 8.2.2.  Research  and  Processing  Actions  Required  to  Assign  Stock  Numbers  to  Non- Cataloged Items. 8.2.2.1.  Purpose:  Describe  the  procedures  Customer  Support  Liaison  must  follow  to assign  a  stock  number  to  a  non-cataloged  item.  Also  describes  the  requirements  for completing DD Form 1348-6, Non-NSN requisition (manual) and actions for processing non-cataloged transactions. 8.2.2.2.  Non-cataloged items consist of part number items, non-NSN items, and nonstick listed (NSL) items. 8.2.2.3.  Verify that the source document (DD Form 1348-6, etc.) contains all necessary data  elements  to  complete  the  research  action  (that  is,  if  a  TO  reference  is  given,  the figure  and  index  must  be  included).  If  a  TO  reference  gives  a  non-procurable  source code,  Maintenance  provides  AFTO  Form  22,  Technical  Manual  Change Recommendation  and  Reply.  If  a  sole  source  or  brand  name  is  specified,  the  customer must provide a letter of justification. 8.2.2.4.  If the data are insufficient, return the document to the requester. 372 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 8.2.2.5.  If  there  are  sufficient  data,  proceed  with  specific  research  actions  outlined  in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for part number items, non-NSN items, and NSL items. 8.2.3.  Indicative Data Codes. 8.2.3.1.  Purpose:  Describe  procedures  required  to  manage  application  codes,  precious metals indicator codes, automated data processing equipment codes and AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical Data codes. 8.2.3.2.  AFMC is primarily responsible for processing all required actions for managing these  codes,  however,  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  will  process  required inputs for all local stock numbered items. See Indicative Data Codes, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S processes on loading, changing, or deleting these codes. 8.2.3.3.  Purpose  of  Application  Codes.  Application  codes  relate  items  to  specific systems, subsystems,  end items, etc. Application codes can be used to  assist in tracking usage  and  cost  analysis  for  a  given  weapon  system.  Application  codes  are  locally assigned,  except  as  stated  in  this  section.  The  major  commands  and  AFMC  can  also assign codes for use by its bases. 8.2.4.  Maintenance of Internal Records. 8.2.4.1.  Purpose: Describe actions required to maintain the internal records of the ILS-S. 8.2.4.2.  Numerous  inputs  are  required  to  maintain  internal  records  and  update  various indicative  data.  See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  8  for  applicable  ILS-S  processes Records Maintenance routinely uses to update and maintain the internal records. 8.2.4.3.  Indicative  data.  See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  8  for  applicable  ILS-S processes to change indicative data on the item record. 8.2.4.4.  Miscellaneous  data.  See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  8  for  applicable  ILS-S processes to load or change miscellaneous data on the item record. 8.2.4.5.  Unit  price, unit of issue, and unit pack quantity. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch  8  for  applicable  ILS-S  processes  to  change  unit  price,  unit  of  issue,  and  unit  pack quantity on internal records. 8.2.4.6.  AFMC only processes price changes during reconciliation, at End-of-Year, and when  problems  arise.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  processes  price  changes for L and P numbered items and make corrections as necessary for stock numbered items. 8.2.4.7.  Customer Support Liaison adjusts the unit price of non-cataloged items (except local  purchase)  as  they  are  received  from  contractors  by  reviewing  advanced  copies  of contract and receipt documents. 8.2.4.8.  Deleting item records. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S processes to delete item records. 8.2.5.  The Stock Number User Directory (SNUD). 8.2.5.1.  Purpose: Describe how each base, once registered as a SNUD user, will process AFMC  output,  request  data  or  report  inaccurate  data,  and  verify  (annually)  its  ILS-S database with the SNUD file. Also discussed is the Defense Inactive Item Program (DIIP) AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 373 and how it meets its objective with the help of the item manager, Distribution, and Stock Control. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S processes. 8.2.5.2.  SNUD,  D071  System,  is  an  AFMC  operated  data  system.  SNUD  distributes stock control data such as stock-lists to the recorded users of the stock numbers. 8.2.5.3.  SNUD  provides  automatic  distribution  of  stock  number  management  data  to bases that are recorded users of the stock number. Distribution based on established user interest  reduces  the  need  for  users  to  manually  research  reference  documents  such  as stock-lists,  stock-list  change  notices,  General  Services  Administration  (GSA)  catalogs, etc. 8.2.6.  Interchangeable and Substitute Group (ISG) Data. 8.2.6.1.  Purpose: Describe actions required to maintain the ISG records in the ILS-S. The ISG  provides  bases  with  information  about  items  that  may  be  used  interchangeably  for local use. By using this information, each base may select suitable substitute items from a wide  range  of  relationships  and  adapt  these  items  for  local  use.  Maximum  use  of  these interchangeable and suitable substitutes will reduce waste throughout the AF. 8.2.6.2.  ISGs consist of items that are similar physically and functionally. In other words, ISG  items  may  be  substituted  for  one  another  and  used  to  do  comparable  work.  After performing these similar tasks, ISG items must consistently provide  the same quality of performance.  Each  group  is  also  designed  to  contain  items  that  have  management  data compatibility. 8.2.6.3.  See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S processes for managing ISG data. AFMC manages ISG actions. 8.2.7.  Assignment and Management of Freeze Codes. 8.2.7.1.  Purpose:  Describe  procedures  for  the  management  and  assignment  of  freeze codes, as well as the management of associated output notices and rejects. 8.2.7.2.  Organizational  freeze  codes  freeze  the  Organization  Cost  Center  Record (OCCR). Freeze code R will be loaded on the OCCR when two conditions are present: 1) when the organization is being deactivated, consolidated, or transferred; and 2) when an external  decision  has  been  made  to  restrict  some  financial  transactions  against  the organization,  while  allowing  the  processing  of  returns  and  reverse-post  transactions  to clear detail records. Freeze code D will be loaded when no further transactions are to be processed. 8.2.7.2.1.  AFMC  and  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  personnel  assign  freeze codes to item records in order to identify the reason for freezing the item record and the responsible activity. See Freeze Code Load or Delete (FFC), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for applicable ILS-S processes on loading and deleting freeze codes. 8.2.7.2.2.  Customer  Support  will  monitor  the  use  of  these  codes.  (T-2).  Note: Materiel Management personnel at a satellite can assign freeze codes only to records of that satellite system designator. 8.2.7.3.  Assignment of Freeze Codes. 374 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 8.2.7.3.1.  Only  one  freeze  code  may  be  assigned  to  an  item  record.  When  an  item record is already frozen, the appropriate material management IT system will reject a second code assignment. 8.2.7.3.2.  The  activity  responsible  for  assigning  the  freeze  codes  will  maintain  a suspense file for each frozen item  record.  (T-2).  Note: Excludes Freeze  Code N for NWRM. 8.2.7.3.3.  Freeze Code Usage and responsibility: 8.2.7.3.3.1.  Code  A.  AFMC  or  LRS  Customer  Support  Liaison  is  Office  of Primary  Responsibility  (OPR)  for  freeze  code  A  and  maintains  the  suspense notice  file.  Use  this  code  when  no  other  freeze  code  applies.  Freeze  code  A  is assigned when a Freeze Code Load is processed (see AFMAN 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8). 8.2.7.3.3.2.  Code C and I. Freeze code C and I designates items under inventory. Physical Inventory Control Section is responsible for the use and control of these freeze codes and maintains the suspense notice file. 8.2.7.3.3.2.1.  Freeze  code  C  identifies  items  under  a  complete  (typically scheduled) inventory. Freeze Code C is automatically assigned as the result of Inventory Recount File processing (See Sec. 5G of this manual for additional information on assigning freeze code C). 8.2.7.3.3.2.2.  Forward all rejects resulting from the existence of freeze code C to Physical Inventory Control for action. 8.2.7.3.3.2.3.  Rejects  for  Freeze  Codes  I  and  C.  Physical  Inventory  Control personnel  will  maintain  a  reject  notices  in  a  suspense  file  in  stock  number sequence.  (T-2).  When  it  is  necessary  for  adequate  control,  Inventory  Count personnel may retain separate suspense files by freeze code. 8.2.7.3.3.2.3.1.  Rejected  Inputs.

AFMC  or  LRS  Functional  Systems  Management  activity assigns this code when either a database key or set error is detected. The activity responsible for assigning the freeze code will maintain a suspense file. 8.2.7.3.3.6.  Code N. The NTCC assigns this code on all NWRM by processing a NWRM Freeze Code Load or Delete.  Note: Coordinate with NTCC to complete NWRM Equipment related transactions processed thru AFEMS. 8.2.7.3.3.7.  Code  P.  Program  Control  loads  and  deletes  this  code.  It  cannot  be loaded or deleted with Freeze Code or Delete inputs. 8.2.7.3.3.7.1.  Program Control assigns this code when a unit of price change is processed for an item with an IEX 3 or 6. Programs delete this code when a Bulk Issue Reconciliation input is processed with a D in position 52. 8.2.7.3.3.7.2.  Program Control also assigns a P freeze code to the item record for  budget  code  8  items  which  are  locally  assigned.  Process  a  Price  List Change Input to remove freeze code P. 8.2.7.3.3.8.  Code Q. This code is assigned to items requiring reverse-post action. Document Control is responsible for maintaining the suspense notice file. 8.2.7.3.3.9.  Code  R.  AFMC  and  Customer  Support  Sections  use  this  code  to freeze item records that may require correction or deletion of indicative data and extended research or checking is  required. The activity responsible for assigning the freeze code will maintain a suspense file. (T-1). 8.2.7.3.3.10.  Code S. AFMC assigns this code and is responsible for maintaining the suspense notices file. 8.2.7.4.  Management  of  Notices.  The  activity  responsible  for  assigning  the  freeze  code will maintain one copy of each load output suspense notice or frozen record notice in a suspense  file  in  stock  number  sequence.  (T-2).  See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  8  for applicable ILS-S processes for management notices and rejects. 8.2.7.4.1.  Inputs  rejected  because  the  item  record  is  frozen  (except  freeze  codes  C and  I) will be placed behind  the load output suspense notice/frozen record notice in the suspense file. 8.2.7.4.2.  The activity assigned the freeze code is responsible for prompt clearance of freeze codes. When item records are frozen more than three working days, a justified reason for the delay must be written on the suspense notice. 8.2.7.4.3.  Freeze codes will be monitored daily using a locally designed query. (T-2). The activity assigned the freeze code is responsible for the prompt clearance of their respective freeze codes. Item records frozen for more than three working days require a justified reason for the delay and must be annotated on the locally designed query. 8.2.7.4.4.  When an output suspense delete notice is received, the matching suspense load  notice/frozen  record  notice  and  any  rejected  documents  will  be  removed  from 376 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 the  suspense  file  and  reinput.  The  area  responsible  for  assigning  the  freeze  code  to complete processing for suspended transactions. 8.2.8.  Management of Controlled Item Codes (CIC). 8.2.8.1.  Purpose: Describe procedures required to manage controlled item codes. 8.2.8.2.  Controlled  items  require  different  kinds  of  handling  for  security  purposes.  The controlled item code is a one-position alpha/numeric code used to indicate the degree of security  handling  needed  for  a  given  item.  See  DoD  4100.39-M  for  a  complete  list  and Controlled Inventory Item Code definitions. 8.2.8.3.  Research assigns the controlled item  code when the item  record is  first  loaded. Records  Maintenance  or  Inspection  is  responsible  for  all  subsequent  actions.  It  is  the responsibility of Records Maintenance to ensure that all controlled item phrase codes are loaded. 8.2.8.4.  When incorrect coding is suspected, assign the code requiring a higher degree of security  handling.  When  the  item  is  included  in  SNUD,  you  can  submit  an  inquiry  to SNUD. SNUD will submit current stock control data via SNUD input. When the degree of security is still questionable, the personnel responsible for cataloging the item should be  contacted.  SNUD  inquiries  are  always  submitted  under  the  FB  account  of  the computer support base. 8.2.8.5.  Local managers, at their discretion, can upgrade items coded through SNUD as unclassified,  nonsensitive,  or  nonpilferable  to  pilferable  status.  Such  items  will  be assigned  controlled  item  code  asterisk  (*).  An  (*)  can  be  assigned  only  to  item  records having  an  existing  code  of  U  and  will  not  be  changed  through  SNUD  interface.  See Controlled  Item  Code  Change  and  Upgrade,  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  8  for applicable materiel mgt. system processes on changing and upgrading the CIC, as well as system output and rejects. 8.2.9.

Process these receipts IAW AFI 24-203. 9.2.1.5.6.  Process  those  RESUPPLY  BARGE  requirements  which  do  not  make  the barge but are later airlifted as receipts to include providing copies of receiving reports as outlined above. 9.2.1.6.  The  following  actions  will  be  performed  by  sites  throughout  the  RESUPPLY BARGE support arena: 9.2.1.6.1.  Submit  annual  RESUPPLY  BARGE  requirements  in  accordance  with  the schedule of events published by the RESUPPLY BARGE manager. 9.2.1.6.2.  Perform normal inventory procedures, as described in Sec. 5G. 9.2.1.6.3.  Forecast  annual  RESUPPLY  BARGE  requirements  using  the  preliminary requirements listing. The RESUPPLY BARGE manager distributes the requirements list  at  the  annual  meeting  in  August.  This  listing  reflects  authorized  RESUPPLY BARGE item records loaded at each satellite account. Each contractor is responsible 384 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 for  determining  required  items  within  their  account  or  accounts.  Each  item  on  the listing  must  be  reviewed  and  the  actual  quantity  required  will  be  annotated  on  the listing. At a minimum, the requirements listing will be reviewed with managers from Civil  Engineering  and  Transportation  to  determine  if  suggested  order  quantities  are adequate based on future projects. A statement of review signed by the contractor will be  annotated  on  the  requirements  list.  The  review  statement  will  indicate  the quantities are valid to support stated requirements. 9.2.1.6.4.  Initiate DD Forms 1348-6, Non-NSN Requisition Request, as required, for non-NSN/local  purchase  requirements.  See  DD  Form  1348-6  Preparation  for  Non-NSN  Items, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for specific  guidance on filling out  this form. 9.2.1.6.5.  Initiate  initial  requirements  for  E-36  Deicer  for  Runways,  NSN  6850  01 341 9856, and submit to the RESUPPLY BARGE manager for Eareckson and King Salmon  sites  by  15  October  of  each  year  to  allow  the  item  manager  to  establish  a requirements-type  contract  with  the  vendor.  Submit  additional  quantities  of  E-36 Deicer  to  the  RESUPPLY  BARGE  manager  by  14  November  of  each  year. Additionally,  ordering  E-36  Deicer  during  this  time  period  ensures  contract  award and  shipment  of  E-36  Deicer  by  the  contractor  to  the  SDDC  in  time  to  meet  barge sailing dates. 9.2.1.6.6.  Forward  request  with  any  DD  Form  1348-6s  to  673  Customer  Support Element  no  later  than  15  October  upon  completion  of  the  review  and  annotation  of the preliminary requirements. 9.2.1.6.7.  Will not requisition out of cycle items without a memo due out established to  support  the  requirement.  The  673  Customer  Support  Element  will  ensure requisitioning action is taken for all validated RESUPPLY BARGE requirements on a daily basis. 9.2.1.6.8.  The  following  actions  are  performed  by  RESUPPLY  BARGE  sites  when receipting for items: 9.2.1.6.8.1.  Use  DD  Form  1348-1A  or  other  acceptable  vendor  shipping document as the receiving document. 9.2.1.6.8.2.  Annotate  discrepant  receipts,  including  overages  and  shortages,  on the receipt document and process IAW AFI 24-203. 9.2.1.6.8.3.  Utilize  Degraded  Operations  issue  procedures,  as  contained  in  Sec. 2E as applicable to the issue of RESUPPLY BARGE assets. 9.2.1.6.8.4.  Forward receiving documentation to 673 Customer Support Element within 5 working days following delivery and in-checking of materiel at  the site for final receipt/due-out release processing. 9.2.1.6.8.5.  Issue  all  RESUPPLY  BARGE  assets the  LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  or  site  contractor  by  due-out  release  immediately  upon receipt processing. to 9.2.1.6.8.6.  In-process  those  RESUPPLY  BARGE  requirements,  which  do  not make  the  barge  but  are  later  airlifted,  using  the  receiving  procedures  outlined AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 385 above. 9.2.1.7.  The following actions will be performed by the receiving sites when controlling and accounting for empty RESUPPLY BARGE gas cylinders FSC 8120: 9.2.1.7.1.  Ensure all site remote locations store  and maintain accountability prior to shipment to local vendor for refill or DLADS for disposal actions. (T-1). The AF no longer has a dedicated barge to handle retrograde. Only those cylinders, which do not have  stocks  available  at  the  host  supply  account,  will  be  shipped  via  air  to  local vendors for subsequent refill actions. 9.2.1.7.2.  Report to the RESUPPLY BARGE manager any empty cylinders requiring disposal.  The  RESUPPLY  BARGE  manager  will  then  direct  appropriate  disposal actions. At no time will empty cylinders be shipped to JBER without prior approval. This  will  ensure  disposal  can  be  completed  expeditiously  and  that  stocks  are  not maintained in the host supply account. (T-1). 9.2.1.7.3.  Ensure  that  prior  to  shipment  via  barge  or  air  and  surface,  cylinders  are properly  palletized  IAW  AFMAN  23-210,  Joint  Service  Manual  (JSM)  for  Storage and  Materials.  (T-0). Shipping documentation  must  also  clearly indicate  that empty cylinders are required for RESUPPLY BARGE and the year required. (T-2). 9.2.1.7.4.  The  673  LRS  Asset  Management  Section  is  no  longer  responsible  for storing empty RESUPPLY BARGE cylinders. Individual remote locations will store and  requisition  those  cylinders  that  are  required  to  meet  the  upcoming  re-supply efforts.  Cylinders  required  to  fulfill  annual  RESUPPLY  BARGE  requirements,  that missed  barge  sailing  dates,  must  be  shipped  via  air  to  JBER  marked  for  subsequent consolidated shipment, as directed by 611th ASUS/LR. 9.2.1.7.5.  The  following  information  will  be  identified  by  remote  locations  when identifying RESUPPLY BARGE cylinder requirements: 9.2.1.7.5.1.  NSN  of  the  cylinder,  type  and  capacity  of  cylinder  (EXAMPLES: Acetylene 225CF, CO2 50 Pounds). 9.2.1.7.5.2.  Quantity  on  hand,  and  total  number  of  cylinders  by  size  and  type, needed to fill current year RESUPPLY BARGE requirements. 9.2.1.7.6.  Gas cylinders shipped via barge or air and surface will be clearly marked for  remote  operating  locations.  Each  remote  location  must  maintain  a  separate  AF Form  2009-1,  Manual  Supply  Accounting  Record,  on  each  type  (NSN)  cylinder maintained in stock. The contractor must report those cylinders that are excess to site operational requirements to the SOS, as required, and request disposition instructions. No  cylinders  will  be  shipped  to  the  host  supply  account  at  JBER  for  disposal  or  as serviceable excess. Those cylinders that are authorized for disposal must be properly prepared  for  shipment  via  barge/air  and  an  AF  Form  332  prepared  by  the  using contractor prior to shipment to the host base for disposal action by the local disposal activity. The responsible contractor  at  remote locations must ensure demilitarization is scheduled to be accomplished, ensuring expeditious transfer to DLADS facilities. 9.2.1.8.  Any excess and scrap materiel identified for retrograde by RESUPPLY BARGE must be reported to the RESUPPLY BARGE manager no later than 1 March each year. 386 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 This  early  reporting  is  necessary  in  order  to  pre-plan  barge  loads  to  accommodate retrograde  from  all  sites  and  LRSs.  A  final  retrograde  report  must  be  submitted  to  the 611th ASUS/LR/LRT RESUPPLY BARGE manager by 1 May. Reports must include the stock number, unit of issue, nomenclature, quantity, approximate weight and cube of each item, and one copy of the return/shipping document. 9.2.1.9.  Hazardous  Material/Waste  must  be  processed  to  the  designated  Hazardous Storage Facility at DLADS, JBER, AK. 9.2.1.10.  Once the Hazardous Material/Waste is processed, forward two advance copies of the DD Form 1348-1A (shipping document) to RESUPPLY BARGE manager. 9.2.1.11.  The  following  actions  will  be  performed  when  retrograding  condemned accountable equipment items (EAID) and non-hazardous scrap material. 9.2.1.11.1.  Site  personnel  must  obtain  disposition  instructions  from  673  Customer Support Element prior to shipment of EAID and non-hazardous scrap material. 9.2.1.11.2.  Coordinate  all  EAID  assets the  673  EAE  and  Vehicle Management  as  applicable  to  ensure  all  equipment  return  actions  are  captured. Prepare  manual  shipping  document  (DD  Form  1348-1A)  for  retrograde  of  all condemned Non-EAID (NF1 or XB3) budget code 9 assets and non-hazardous scrap material destined for DLADS activity IAW, Chapter 6. through 9.2.1.11.3.  King  Salmon  and  Eareckson  will  prepare  and  forward  documents terminating  supply/equipment  accountability  (AF  Form  601/DD  Form  1348-1A)  to 673 EAE. See Chapter 5 for specific procedures on preparing these documents. All sites  will  provide  the  signed  copy  two  of  the  shipping  document  to  RESUPPLY BARGE manager. (T-2). 9.2.1.12.  Normally,  serviceable  materials  (excess  supplies)  will  be  used  in-theater  and not  retrograded  to  the  Seattle  SDDC.  Site  personnel  will  report  serviceable  excesses  to 673 LRS Customer Support Element for disposition instructions. 9.2.2.  Managing Procedures for the USAF Heritage Program. 9.2.2.1.  Purpose:  To  provide  guidance  and  procedures  for  the  donation  of  and  loan  of USAF historical property. 9.2.2.2.  Refer to AFI 84-103, for policy, guidance, and procedures for the donation and loan of USAF historical property to non-USAF organizations and to non-federal entities. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 387 Chapter 10 INTENSIVELY MANAGED AND TRACKED ITEMS Section 10A—Overview 10.1.  Overview.  This  chapter  outlines  procedures  affecting  AF  intensively  managed  and tracked  items.  These  include  management  of  controlled  material  to  include  NWRM  and  other controlled or sensitive items. As listed in Attachment 1A, various DOD and AF publications are reference sources for this publication. For this chapter, DoDM 4140.01, and AFI 20-110 are the primary DOD and AF references. Section 10B—Management of Controlled Materiel 10.2.  Management of Controlled Materiel. 10.2.1.  Serialized Control and Reporting Small Arms/Light Weapons (SA/LW). 10.2.1.1.  Purpose:  Describe  the  general  procedures  associated  with  the  management  of SA/LW. This section specifically covers procedures for serialized coding, reporting and reconciliation, serial number detail information and serial number control processing. For policy specific requirements  review AFI 23-101, Sec. 10B  and for  IT specific  guidance use AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 or the ES-S User’s Manual. 10.2.1.2.  Caution: Do not process controlled material as found on base. See Sec. 6B, of this manual for exceptions to FOB processing. 10.2.1.3.  General Procedure for SA/LW. 10.2.1.3.1.  When SA/LWs are received or shipped, unpack the SA/LWs to positively identify the serial number on the bare equipment. 10.2.1.3.2.  Coordinate  off-base  shipments  through  transportation  channels  prior  to processing.  Shipping  arrangements  will  be  obtained  from  Deployment  and Distribution. 10.2.1.3.3.  All source documents for SA/LW will be processed and sent to Document Control  within  3  workdays  from  the  ILS-S  processed  date  or  the  date  processed  in degraded operations. 10.2.1.3.3.1.  The  serial  numbers  for  each  transaction  will  be  listed  on  the management notice in conjunction with the output (source) document. 10.2.1.3.3.2.  Document Control will file a copy of the management notice along with the source document. (T-1). 10.2.1.3.3.3.  Documents processed during Degraded Operations and hand scribed documents  will  be  held  for  processing  until  the  ILS-S  becomes  available  and recovery  transactions  are  processed.  Make  sure  the  correct  serial  numbers  are transcribed on the documents. 10.2.1.3.4.  SA/LW  requiring  serialized  control  and  reporting  are  identified  on  the item  record  by  a  serialized  report  code  (SRC)  of  A.  The  SRC  is  assigned  by,  the 388 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 AFMC  SA/LW  Serialized  Control  Activity  and  is  pushed  to  bases  by  the  Stock Number  User  Directory  (SNUD)  using  Stock  List  Change  transactions.  Controlled item  codes  (CIC)  N,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6  or  8  are  also  assigned  to  these  items.  Serialized reporting does not apply to barrels, firing mechanisms, etc. These items are assigned a CIC N to indicate they require special control/warehousing to prevent pilferage. Only items with a SRC A are reported to the AFEMS system. 10.2.1.3.5.  When  a  transaction  at  base  level  increases  or  decreases  the  base  asset position, a daily change report is  generated under program  control  If the transaction pertains  to  a  type  account  E,  ERRCD  NF2/ND2  item,  the  daily  change  report  is forwarded  to  AFEMS  (C001)  via  Daily  Equipment  Transaction  Report  files.  Note: IEX B is not required for items assigned SRC A. 10.2.1.3.6.  The  actual  serial  numbers  for  each  item  coded  with  SRC  A  are maintained on either a 249 serialized control detail or a 250 in-use serialized control detail.  A  Weapons  Serialized  Control  input  is  used  to  load,  change  or  delete  these details. (See Weapons Serialized Control Input (DSR), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10  for  transaction  format)  Up  to  ten  (10)  eleven  digit  serial  numbers  may  be  input with one Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format Two transaction. Serial numbers for items in serviceable stock or on an unserviceable detail, regardless of ERRCD, are maintained on a 249 serialized control detail. Upon issue these details will convert to a 250 in-use serialized control detail. Example: There are 100 weapons in serviceable stock, with 100 serialized control (249) details loaded. SrA Smith has a requirement for  50  of  these  weapons,  and  her  equipment  account  is  authorized  50  of  these weapons.  After  loading  the  authorized  in-use  detail,  EAE  will  process  a  Weapons Serialized  Control  Input-Format  Two  with  type  phrase  ISU/DOR  and  the  program prepares those 50 details selected for issue to SrA Smith’s equipment account. When the issue request is processed, those 50 serialized control (249) details selected will be deleted, and program control will create 50 in-use serialized control (250) details with the authorized in-use detail  document number. The remaining 249 serialized control details  stay  on  the  item  record,  and  the  serviceable  balance  will  reflect  50  EA.  The same  theory  applies  to  items  issued  to  other  types  of  details,  i.e.,  RSP,  MSK, SPRAM, WRM and supply point from serviceable stock. 10.2.1.3.7.  The LRS CC/AO will not track type account B SRC A assets (i.e., aircraft weapons coded as XD, XF, XB) once they are issued to the using organization. 10.2.1.3.8.  Serial  Number Entry. Enter all serial numbers left  justified. The SA/LW serial  number  must  not  be  prefixed  by  zeros  unless  the  zero  is  part  of  the  serial number. Examples: If the serial number is 123, it will be entered as ‘123’. If the serial number is 0123, it will be entered as ‘0123.’ 10.2.1.4.  SA/LW  Reidentification.  When  it  is  necessary  to  reidentify  SA/LWs  (for example,  M-16  modification),  use  the Weapon  Modification  program  (see  Weapon  (M-16) Modification (NGV441), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6). Both stock numbers must have  a  serialized  report  code  of  "A"  assigned.  The  Federal  Supply  Class  (FSC)  of  both stock numbers must be 1005, 1010, 1015, or 1095. If any one item under a selected detail is deployed, that detail will not be modified and a statement will be printed on the output listing notifying requester there is external review required for that detail. When the total AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 389 numbers of 250 in-use serialized control details do not equal the on-hand quantity of the authorized in-use detail, the program will only modify the number of existing 250 in-use serialized control details, not to exceed the authorized quantity. The program will print a statement  on  the  output  listing  notifying  the  requester  of  the  total  number  of  details modified,  number  of  details  not  modified,  and  if  external  review  is  required.  A  Small Arms Multi-field Correction report is produced and forwarded via SIFS to AFEMS (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for additional information on this report). 10.2.1.5.  Serialized Report Code (SRC) Changes. 10.2.1.5.1.  Verification. When the SRC changes from an “A” to blank or from blank to  an “A,” an  F118 Management Notice is  generated by program  control. The F118 will print the Catalog Management Data Change Record input image with a clear text statement indicating the change “to” and “from” SRC. AFMC must verify the change for  cataloged  items  with  the  D043.  Once  validated  the  LRS/Materiel  Management Activity will take appropriate warehousing/Inventory actions. (T-1). 10.2.1.5.2.  Procedures  for  Valid  Changes.  If  the  SRC  change  is  valid,  the LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  will  process  a  Serialized  Control  Input-Format Two  to  add  or  delete  the  applicable  249  serialized  control/250  in-use  serialized control detail(s). See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for transaction formats. Note: SRC cannot be deleted if serialized control/in use serialized control details are loaded. 10.2.1.5.3.  Procedures  for  Invalid  Changes.  For  invalid  changes,  AFMC  will reprocess the Catalog Management Data Change Record to input the correct SRC. 10.2.1.6.  Weapon Reconciliation. 10.2.1.6.1.  Reconciliation  Actions.  Prior  to  30  April  process  the  edit  option  of  the Weapon  Reconciliation  Report  with  a  (-)  dash  in  position  65.  This  option  compares the on-hand balance and detail balance to 249 serialized control/250 in-use serialized control detail records. 10.2.1.6.1.1.  An error listing is produced for records that do not pass edits. Take action to correct errors and out-of-balance conditions. 10.2.1.6.1.2.  When  all  reporting  errors  are  corrected  and  all  out-of-balance conditions  have  been  resolved,  process  the  Weapon  Reconciliation  Report  with ‘W’ in  position 66 of the program  select  card to create the outbound  SIFS files. The SIFS files are automatically transmitted to the appropriate receiving system. External  review  is  not  necessary.  Note:  Do  not  process  the  SIFS  option  earlier than 30 April unless directed by the AFMC SA/LW Serialized Control Activity or the applicable Major Command. 10.2.1.6.2.  Overages  and  shortages  identified  during  reconciliation  with  the  AFMC SA/LW  Serialized  Control  Activity  must  be  thoroughly  researched,  inventoried, and/or appropriate investigative actions initiated. 10.2.1.6.3.  Invalid Reconciliation Reject Notice. The LRS CC/AO will not maintain visibility of type account B (ERRCD XD, XF, XB) weapons once they are issued to the using organization. They will not be included in the annual reconciliation. It is the responsibility  of  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  SA/LW  POC  to  research 390 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 these notices, and ensure these items have in fact been issued to a using organization. No response is required for these reject notices. 10.2.1.7.  Error Notices. When an error is detected by the AFEMS system, a Small Arms Reject/Follow-up with an error notification code in positions 23-24 is transmitted to the reporting  SRAN.  (Error  notification  codes  are  defined  in  COMSEC  Error  Notification Codes,  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  10.).  When  the  Small  Arms  Reject/Follow-up  is processed, an F122 Management Notice is generated under program control. 10.2.1.7.1.  Research.  Bases  will  research  the  error  notice  and  take  action  to  correct the discrepancy. (T-1). 10.2.1.7.2.  Serial  numbers  for  type  account  B  assets  are  not  stored  on  serialized control  records  after  issue,  so  any  inquiries/error  notifications  must  be  verified  with the  owning  organization.  The  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  SA/LW  POC  is required to research the transaction history to determine what organization was issued the asset and contact the organization to verify if they have the serial number. 10.2.1.7.3.  After  thorough  research  is  completed,  process  a  Small  Arms  Correction Report  (See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  10  for  format  and  entry  requirements). Transmission to AFEMS will be the same as used for daily change reports. 10.2.1.8.  Serial Number Modifications. 10.2.1.8.1.  Forced  Record  Alteration  program  is  no  longer  required  to  change  a serialized control serial number. 10.2.1.8.2.  Only Chief Inspectors are authorized to process a Serialized Control Input (XS1)  transaction.  Use  a  Serialized  Control  Input  (XS1)  to  load  serialized  control details  that  have  been  erroneously  deleted,  to  delete  serialized  control  details  that were  incorrectly  loaded,  or  to  change  the  serial  number  on  serialized  control  detail. For NWRM, Chief Inspector must notify the NTCC of serial number changes before processing. (T-1).  See Serialized Control Input (XS1), AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for format and entry requirements. 10.2.1.9.  SA/LW Serial Number Transaction Processing. 10.2.1.9.1.  When  processing  transactions  that  affect  the  total  on-hand  or  detail quantity,  normal  processing  procedures  apply.  When  processing  a  transaction  for  a partial quantity, identify affected serial numbers before you process the transaction. 10.2.1.9.1.1.  An  F117  Management  Notice  listing  the  serial  number(s)  will  be printed  in  conjunction  with  output  documents  created  as  a  result  of  completed transactions. 10.2.1.9.1.2.  All SRC A items must have a 249 serialized control detail or 250 in-use serialized control loaded or the transactions will reject. 10.2.1.9.1.3.  When a receipt receiving an error condition, limit the quantity to 80 on related transactions (issues, receipts, etc.) involving serialized control details. If more than 80 serial numbers are involved, break up the transaction for multiple inputs. 10.2.1.9.2.  Issues. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 391 10.2.1.9.2.1.  Issue  of  total  on-hand  quantity  to  a  detail.  If  the  total  on-hand quantity is being issued to a detail (i.e. RSP, MSK, SPRAM, WRM, supply point) normal  issue  procedures  apply;  and  Weapons  Serialized  Control  Input-Format Two processing is not necessary. The applicable 249 serialized control detail will be  deleted  and  a  250  in-use  serialized  control  will  be  established  by  program control.  The  newly  created  250  in-use  serialized  control  will  reflect  the  same document  number  as  the  ‘parent’  detail.  Note:  The  number  of  serialized  control details must equal the item record serviceable balance to process a total on-hand balance. 10.2.1.9.2.2.  Issue of partial on-hand quantity to a detail. If less than the total on-hand quantity is being issued to a detail, identify which serial number(s) to issue. Process  a  Weapons  Serialized  Control-Format  Two  input  with  type  phrase ‘ISU/DOR.’  This  will  load  an  ‘I’  in  the  RECEIPT-CODE  field  of  the  249 serialized  control  detail  to  prepare  the  detail  for  subsequent  issue  or  due-out release.  Upon  completion  of  issue  processing,  the  applicable  249  serialized control  detail(s)  will  be  deleted  and  a  250  in-use  serialized  control  detail(s)  will be created. The newly created 250 in-use serialized control will reflect  the same document  number  as  the  ‘parent’  detail.  Note:  Prior  to  processing  transactions from serialized control details, it may be necessary to coordinate with warehouse personnel to determine which serial numbers to identify. 10.2.1.9.2.3.  Issues  to  an  organization.  Serial  number  accountability  for  type account  B  items  (ERRCD  XD/XF/XB)  becomes  the  responsibility  of  the  using organization at the time of issue. 10.2.1.9.2.4.  Issue  of  total  quantity  from  a  detail.  If  the  total  detail  quantity  is being  issued,  normal  issue  procedures  apply.  All  250  in-use  serialized  control details identified will be deleted. 10.2.1.9.2.5.  Issue of partial quantity from a detail. When less than the total detail quantity is being issued you must identify the serial number(s) to issue. Process a Weapons  Serialized  Control  Input-Format  Two  with  “MSI”  in  the  first  three positions  of the  type  phrase  field  to  load  an  “M”  to  the  in-use  serialized control detail. After the record(s) is/are flagged, normal  MSI procedures apply. The 250 in-use  serialized  control  details  identified  will  be  deleted.  New  250  In-use serialized  control  details  will  be  established  for  type  account  E  items  under  the organization  and  shop  of  the  using  organization,  not  to  exceed  the  authorized quantity. 10.2.1.9.2.5.1.  When  items  are  issued  from  a  detail,  the  issue  programs  will try to replenish the detail unless an “F” is in  position 54 of the issue request input.  When  the  on-hand  balance  is  greater  than  the  replenishment  quantity the  replenishment  transaction  will  reject  unless  the  applicable  249  serialized control  detail  is  identified  for  issue.  To  avoid  rejects,  it’s  recommended  all issues  for  serialized  control  items  from  a  detail  are  processed  with  an  F  in position 54 of the issue request input. When replenishment is desired after the transaction  is  processed,  refer  to  issue  processing  in  SA/LW  Serial  Number Transaction Processing. 392 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 10.2.1.9.2.5.2.  Issues cannot be processed from one detail to another. A return from  the  “issuing”  detail  must  be  processed  to  the  item  record  then  another issue processed to the gaining detail. 10.2.1.9.3.  Returns. 10.2.1.9.3.1.  Return  of  total  detail  quantity.  When  the  total  detail  quantity  is being  returned,  normal  return  procedures  apply.  The  in-use  serialized  control detail (250 record) will be deleted and a 249 serialized control detail established under program control. 10.2.1.9.3.2.  Return  of  partial  quantity  from  a  detail.  If  less  than  the  total  detail quantity is being returned you must identify the serial numbers for return. Process a Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format Two with the phrase “TURN-IN” to load a “T” to the 250 in-use serialized control detail. After the records are flagged, normal return procedures apply. The flagged in-use serialized control details will be deleted and 249 serialized control details established. 10.2.1.9.3.3.  Return  of  items  not  on  a  detail.  Process  a  Weapons  Serialized Control  Input-Format  Two  with  “TURN-IN”  to  load  a  serialized  control  detail (249  record).  After  the  serialized  control  detail  is  established,  normal  return procedures apply. 10.2.1.9.4.  Shipments.  Shipments  from  details  are  not  allowed.  Items  on  in-use serialized control details must be returned to stock before shipment processing. Note: Transfer is authorized for RSP, MSK, SPRAM, Authorized In-Use and WRM details (see below for transfer procedures). 10.2.1.9.4.1.  For  shipments  of  entire  on-hand  warehouse  balance,  normal shipment procedures apply. 10.2.1.9.4.2.  Shipment of partial on-hand quantity. When less than the total detail quantity is being shipped you must identify the serial number(s) to ship. Process a Weapons Serialized Control  Input-Format  Two  with  the type phrase  ‘ISU/DOR’ to  prepare  the  serialized  control  detail  for  shipment.  Note:  Redistribution Orders/Referrals from MSK and Supply Point Details may be processed. Warner Robins (WR-ALC) is no longer the storage site for weapons. Weapons are stored at  the  Anniston  Army  Depot,  AL.  Weapons  being  returned  to  Depot  must  be shipped to the Anniston Army Depot (FY1346). 10.2.1.9.5.  Receipts. When weapons are shipped from the depot, the AFEMS system forwards a Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format Two with an asterisk in position 7 and type phrase ‘SHIPPED’ to the receiving base to identify which stock number, document  number  and  serial  numbers  are  being  shipped.  The  Weapons  Serialized Control Input-Format Two will be sent through SIFS and processed through pseudo, and  a  serialized  control  detail  will  be  loaded  for  each  serial  numbered  item  being shipped. When the items are received, the serialized control detail should be ready for receipt  processing.  After  successful  receipt  processing  an  F117  Management  Notice is output reflecting all serial numbers processed. 10.2.1.9.5.1.  When  a  615  reject  is  received,  the  serialized  control  detail  is  not AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 393 loaded. If weapons are received and there is not a serialized control detail loaded, process  Weapons  Serialized  Control  Input-Format  Two  with  type  phrase ‘SHIPPED’ to load a the detail. Refer to Weapons Serialized Control Input (DSR) – Format  Two, AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for transaction format and type phrase  codes  that  will  change  the  receipt  codes.  If  the  Due  In  is  not  loaded, process  a  Prepositioned  Materiel  Receipt  to  load  the  due  in  (see  Prepositioned Materiel  Receipts  -  Input/Output  (99S)  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  2  for instructions and format). 10.2.1.9.5.2.  If  a  616  reject  is  received,  there  is  either  not  enough  or  too  many serialized control details loaded for the input document number. 10.2.1.9.5.3.  If a 619 reject is received, the Item Record does not have a SRC. 10.2.1.9.5.4.  If a 620 reject is received, the serialized control detail serial number is already loaded. Process a stock number inquiry, with type record retrieval code ‘Z’  and  ‘249’  for  the  selected  detail  document  number.  This  will  show  all  the serialized control details loaded for this stock number. 10.2.1.9.5.5.  Inbound  Cargo  must  inspect  and  verify  serial  numbers  when  small arms  are  received.  Errors  between  serial  numbers  shipped  and  received  must  be identified  to  the  AFMC  SA/LW  Serialized  Control  Activity.  LRS/Materiel Management Activity SA/LW POC will notify AFMC SA/LW Serialized Control Activity by priority message or email with an information copy to the shipper and MAJCOM of both shipping and receiving activities.  (T-1). The receipt reporting should  be  delayed  until  resolution  by  the  AFMC  SA/LW  Serialized  Control Activity. 10.2.1.9.6.  Record  reversal  and  correction  transactions.  Prior  to  these  transactions process  a  Weapons  Serialized  Control  Input-Format  Two  to  create/delete  the applicable serialized control detail/in-use serialized control detail. Ensure the correct type phrase is used (see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for additional information on type phrase). 10.2.1.9.7.  Deployment Procedures. 10.2.1.9.7.1.  Deployment  Of  Total  Detail  Quantity.  When  the  total  on-hand quantity  of  the  detail  (RSP,  MSK,  SPRAM,  WRM  or  authorized  in-use)  is deployed, normal deployment processing procedures apply. The deployed routing identifier will be stored on the applicable in-use serialized control detail records. 10.2.1.9.7.2.  Deployment  Of  Less  Than  Total  Detail  Quantity.  When  less  than the  total  on-hand  detail  quantity  is  deployed,  process  a  Weapons  Serialized Control  Input-Format  Two  with  type  phrase  “DEPLOY”  to  load  a  “D”  in  the ACTION-CODE  field  of  the  in-use  serialized  control  detail  record.  After  the records  are  flagged,  normal  deployment  processing  procedures  apply.  Program control  deletes  the  “D”  from  the  ACTION  CODE  field  of  the  in-use  serialized control  detail  and  loads  the  deployed  routing  identifier  to  the  DEPLOYED-RID field of the in-use serialized control detail 10.2.1.9.7.3.  Total  Quantity  Returned  From  Deployment.  When  the  total 394 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 deployed  quantity  is  returned,  normal  return  deployment  processing  procedures apply. The deployed routing identifier will be deleted from the applicable in-use serialized control detail (250 record). 10.2.1.9.7.4.  Partial  Quantity  Returned  From  Deployment.  If  less  than  the  total quantity deployed is returned, process a Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format Two with type phrase “RETURN” to load an “R” in the ACTION-CODE field of the  in-use  serialized  control  detail.  After  the  records  are  flagged,  normal  return deployment processing procedures apply. 10.2.1.9.8.  Transfer Procedures. 10.2.1.9.8.1.  Transfer of Total  Detail  Quantity. When the total  on-hand quantity of  the  detail  (RSP,  MSK,  SPRAM,  WRM,  or  authorized  in-use)  is  transferred, normal transfer processing procedures apply. Daily Change Reports are generated under program control to update AFEMS (C001). In addition, Weapons Serialized Control  Input  images  are  created  for  forwarding  to  the  gaining  base  to  establish serialized control details. 10.2.1.9.8.2.  Transfer  of  Less  Than  Total  Detail  Quantity.  When  less  than  the total on-hand detail quantity is transferred, process a Weapons Serialized Control Input-Format  Two  with  type  phrase  “TRANFER”  (Note  the  spelling  of  this phrase) to load a “T” in the ACTION-CODE field. After the records are flagged, normal transfer processing procedures apply. Daily Change Reports are generated under program control to update AFEMS (C001). In addition, Weapons Serialized Control  Input  images  are  created  for  forwarding  to  the  gaining  base  to  establish serialized control detail. 10.2.2.  Serialized Control and Reporting of COMSEC/CCI Items. 10.2.2.1.  Purpose:  Describe  the  general  procedures  associated  with  the  management  of controlled  materiel.  This  section  specifically  covers  the  serialized  control  and  reporting procedures for COMSEC items. 10.2.2.2.  Serialized Report Codes (SRC) for all COMSEC/CCI assets are identified with SRC “C” and SRC “R”. 10.2.2.2.1.  Do not process COMSEC/CCI assets as found on base. If the COMSEC asset  was  received  from  the  National  Security  Agency  or  its  suppliers,  or  has  a documented  history  of  accountability,  e.g.  SF  153,  then  utilize  equipment  receipt. Otherwise,  contact  the  appropriate  Item  Manager  to  determine  ownership  and/or proper  disposition.  Additional  information  can  be  found  at  the  ITAC  website  for NSNs. is: website https://itac.lackland.af.mil/itac/CAC_login.asp?target=/itac/default.asp? ITAC link  The to the 10.2.2.3.  Caution: Observe the following cautions when handling COMSEC/CCI. 10.2.2.3.1.  Do not process COMSEC/CCI assets as found on base. If the COMSEC asset  was  received  from  the  National  Security  Agency  or  its  suppliers,  or  has  a documented  history  of  accountability,  e.g.  SF  153,  then  utilize  equipment  receipt. Otherwise,  contact  the  appropriate  Item  Manager  to  determine  ownership  and/or proper disposition. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 395 10.2.2.3.2.  Foreign  nationals  are  authorized  to  store,  inspect,  deliver,  and  handle controlled cryptographic item (CCI) assets as long as there is a U.S. citizen present. 10.2.2.4.  General Procedure for COMSEC 10.2.2.4.1.  AFMC  Cryptological  System  Activity  monitors  the  central  file  of  all COMSEC assets by serial number via AFEMS. 10.2.2.4.2.  Coordinate  off-base  shipment  through  transportation  channels  prior  to processing. Shipping arrangements should be obtained from LRS Cargo Movement. 10.2.2.4.3.  All  source  documents  for  COMSEC items  will  be  processed  and  sent  to Document Control within 3 workdays from the applicable ILS-S processed date or the Degraded Operations date. 10.2.2.4.3.1.  The  serial  numbers  for  each  transaction  will  be  listed  on  the management  notice  in  conjunction  with  the  output  (source)  document.  All  serial numbers are left  justified. The COMSEC serial  numbers will not  be prefixed by zeros unless the zero is part of the COMSEC serial number. 10.2.2.4.3.2.  Document Control will file a copy of the management notice along with the source document. (T-1). 10.2.2.4.3.3.  Documents  processed  during  Degraded  Operations  procedures  and hand  scribed  documents  will  be  held  for  processing  until  the  ILS-S  becomes available  and recovery transactions are processed. Ensure correct serial numbers are transcribed on the documents. 10.2.2.4.4.  If a transaction at base level increases or decreases the base asset position, a  Daily  Change  Report  is  generated  under  program  control.  If  the  ERRCD  is NF2/ND2  type  account  E,  the  daily  change  report  is  forwarded  to  AFEMS  (C001). (These  change  report  images  are  placed  in  the  same  file  as  the  images  which  go  to AFEMS (C001) for Daily Equipment Transaction reporting). AFEMS (C001) updates the AFEMS database and forward the images to  AFEMS (ACOM screen) to  update the central file. Daily Change Reports for ERRCD XB/XF/XD type account B items are sent directly to AFEMS (ACOM screen). 10.2.2.4.5.  The actual serial numbers for each item coded with SRC C is maintained on either a 249 Serialized Control Detail Record or a 250 In-Use Serialized Control Detail Record. 10.2.2.4.5.1.  Serial numbers for items in serviceable stock or on an unserviceable detail,  regardless  of  ERRCD,  are  maintained  on  249  Serialized  Control  Detail records. 10.2.2.4.5.2.  Serial numbers for items coded as equipment will transfer to 250 In-Use Serialized Control Detail records when issued to the customer. (For example: When you are authorized three COMSEC assets on an in-use detail and have three on-hand there will be three 250 in-use serialized control records linked to that in-use  detail.)  Serial  numbers  for  items  maintained  on  a  detail  (i.e.,  MRSP,  MSK, SPRAM,  WRM,  and  supply  point)  are  also  accounted  for  on  250  In-Use Serialized Control records. 396 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 10.2.2.4.6.  The LRS CC/AO will not track type account B COMSEC assets (ERRCD XB/XF/XD) once they are issued to the using organization. 10.2.2.5.  COMSEC Reconciliation. All COMSEC assets on detail records or on hand in supply will be reconciled semiannually with AFEMS (C001) for type account code B and E  assets.  AFEMS  (C001)  will  process  the  type  E  COMSEC  assets  reconciliation  data received  into  the  AFEMS  database  and  then  forward  those  images  to  AFEMS  (ACOM screen)  for  processing  of  the  reconciliation.  AFEMS  (ACOM  screen)  will  process  the data  received  from  AFEMS  (C001)  and  the  type  account  B  COMSEC  assets  data received straight from the bases. 10.2.2.5.1.  Reconciliation  actions.  Process  COMSEC  Reconciliation  prior  to  15 March/15 Apr and 15 Sep/15 Oct, (position 64 equals a dash (-) see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 of additional processing instructions). This option will compare the on-hand  balance  and  detail  balance  to  serialized  control  records.  An  error  listing  is produced  for  records  that  do  not  pass  edits.  When  all  reporting  errors  are  corrected and  any  out-of-balance  conditions  have  been  resolved,  process  the  COMSEC Reconciliation  program  again  (with  C  in  position  66  of  the  program  select  card)  to create the outbound SIFS file. 10.2.2.5.2.  Non-receipt.  AFEMS  (ACOM  screen)  sends  a  COMSEC  Control  Reject Report with ERROR MESSAGE: “The required semiannual reconciliation report was not received” to  any base which fails to process  the reconciliation as required. Take action to have the reconciliation report processed with C in position 66 of the report parameter  (see  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  2,  Ch  6  for  additional  assistance  with processing the Weapon/COMSEC Reconciliation program. 10.2.2.5.3.  The  LRS  CC/AO  does  not  maintain  visibility  of  type  account  B COMSEC/CCI  (ERRC  XD/XF/XB)  assets  once  they  are  issued  to  the  using organization,  therefore;  they  are  not  included  in  the  reconciliation.  The  ILSS  will report serial numbers for these items when they are shipped. 10.2.2.5.4.  Out-of-Cycle Reconciliation.  AFMC  Cryptological  System Activity may direct  out-of-cycle  reconciliations  reports  with  MAJCOM  approval.  Out-of-cycle reconciliations  and  transmission  of  data  will  follow  the  same  schedule/actions  as scheduled reconciliations. 10.2.2.6.  COMSEC Control Error Notification. 10.2.2.6.1.  AFEMS  Processing.  AFEMS  processes  COMSEC  serialized  control reports  from  bases  daily.  When  an  error  is  detected  by  the  AFEMS,  a  COMSEC Control Reject Record is transmitted to the reporting SRAN according to  COMSEC Control Reject Report (XHB) in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10. Error notification codes and possible corrective actions for these rejects are defined in COMSEC Error Notification Codes in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10. 10.2.2.6.2.  Base  Corrective  Action.  Bases  will  correct  the  errors,  change  the transaction ID in positions 1-3 to a COMSEC Control Report and the RIC in positions 4-6  to  FNL  for  type  accounts  B  and  E  COMSEC  assets.  Then  transmit  within  5 calendar days of receipt of error notification. Transmission will be the same as used for  daily  transaction.  Bases  which  have  problems  correcting  COMSEC  error AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 397 notification code rejects should contact AFMC Cryptological System Activity prior to resubmission. 10.2.2.7.  SRC Changes. 10.2.2.7.1.  Verification. When the SRC changes from a “C” or “R” to blank or blank to “C” or “R” a F118 Management Notice is generated by program control. The F118 Mgmt  Notice  will  print  the  Catalog  Management  Data  Change  Record  input  image with a clear text statement indicating the change “to” and “from” SRC. AFMC must verify  the  change  for  cataloged  items  with  the  D043.  Once  validated  the LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  will  take  appropriate  warehousing/Inventory actions. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for Weapons Serialized Control-Format Two format and entry requirements. 10.2.2.7.2.  Procedures  for  Valid  Changes.  When  the  SRC  change  is  valid,  the LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  will  take  action  to  add  or  delete  the  applicable 249/250  serialized  control  detail  record(s).  Note:  The  Catalog  Management  Data Change Record input will not allow the serialized report code to be deleted if 249/250 serialized control details are loaded. 10.2.2.7.3.  .  Procedures  for  Invalid  Changes.  For  invalid  changes,  AFMC  will reprocess  the  Catalog  Management  Data  Change  Record  to  input  the  correct  SRC. See  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  8  for  additional  instructions  on  transaction processing. 10.2.2.8.  COMSEC Serial Number Transaction Processing. 10.2.2.8.1.  When  processing  transactions  that  affect  the  total  on  hand  or  detail quantity normal processing procedures will apply. When you process a transaction for a  partial  quantity  you  must  identify  specific  serial  numbers  before  the  in-line transaction is processed. 10.2.2.8.1.1.  An  F117  Management  Notice  listing  the  serial  number(s)  will  be printed  in  conjunction  with  output  documents  created  as  a  result  of  a  completed transaction. 10.2.2.8.1.2.  All  SRC  C  and  R  items  must  have  a  corresponding  249  or  250 serialized control record loaded or transactions will reject. 10.2.2.8.1.3.  Use  Serialized  Control  Inputs  (XS1)  to  load,  change,  or  deleted serialized  control  details.  A  Forced  Record  Alteration  is  no  longer  required  to change serialized control serial numbers. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for additional instructions. 10.2.2.8.1.3.1.  The  Chief  Inspector  or  the  NTCC  are  the  only  authorized personnel to process a Serialized Control Input to change the serial number on serialized control details for NWRM (SRC R items). The Chief Inspector must notify the NTCC of the serial number change. (T-1). 10.2.2.8.1.4.  When  receipt  of  an  error  condition,  limit  the  quantity  to  80  on related  transactions  (issues,  receipts,  etc.)  involving  serialized  control  details. When  more  than  80  serial  numbers  are  involved,  break  up  the  transaction  for multiple inputs. 398 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 10.2.2.8.2.  Issues. 10.2.2.8.2.1.  Issue  of  total  on-hand  quantity  to  a  detail.  When  the  total  on-hand quantity  is  being  issued  to  a  detail  (i.e.,  MRSP,  MSK,  SPRAM,  WRM,  Supply Point)  normal  issue  procedures  apply.  The  applicable  249  serialized  control record(s) is deleted and  250 an in-use serialized  control record(s) established by program  control.  The new 250 in-use serialized  control record(s) will reflect  the last four positions of the detail document number. 10.2.2.8.2.2.  Issue of partial on-hand quantity to a detail. When less than the total on-hand quantity is being issued to a detail, identify the serial number(s) to issue. 10.2.2.8.2.2.1.  When  processing  serial  numbers  from  serialized  control records  coordinate  with  warehouse  personnel  to  determine  which  serial numbers to identify. 10.2.2.8.2.2.2.  Process  a  COMSEC  Serialized  Control  Input-Format  Two with  the  phrase  “ISU/DOR”  in  the  type  phrase  field  to  load  an  “I”  in  the receipt  code  field  of  the  249  serialized  control  detail  record.  After  the record(s)  are  flagged,  normal  issue  procedures  apply.  The  applicable  249 serialized control record(s) is deleted and a new 250 in-use serialized control record(s)  established.  The  250  in-use  serialized  control  record(s)  reflects  the last four positions of the detail document number. 10.2.2.8.2.3.  Issue to an organization. 10.2.2.8.2.3.1.  Serial number accountability for type account B items (ERRC XD/XF/XB) becomes the responsibility of the using organization at  the time of issue. 10.2.2.8.2.3.2.  When the total  on-hand quantity is being  issued normal  issue procedures  apply.  For  type  account  E  items,  the  249  serialized  control record(s)  is  deleted  and  a  new  250  in-use  serialized  control  record(s)  is established reflecting the last four positions of the in-use document number. 10.2.2.8.2.3.3.  Issue of partial on-hand quantity to an organization. When less than the total on-hand quantity is being issued identify the serial number(s) to issue.  Process  a  COMSEC  Serialized  Control  Input-Format  Two  with  the phrase “ISU/DOR” to load an “I” in the receipt code field of the 249 serialized control  detail  record.  After  the  records  are  flagged,  normal  issue  procedures apply. For type account E items, the 249 serialized control detail record(s)  is deleted  and  a  250  in-use  serialized  control  record(s)  is  established  reflecting the  last  four  positions  of  the  in-use  document  number.  Serial  number accountability  for  type  account  B  items  (ERRC  XD/XF/XB)  becomes  the responsibility of the using organization at the time of issue. 10.2.2.8.2.4.  Issue of total quantity from a detail. When the total detail quantity is being  issued  normal  issue  procedures  apply.  The  250  in-use  serialized  control detail  record(s)  is  deleted  and  250  in-use  serialized  control  detail  record(s)  is established for type account E items, reflecting the last four positions of the in-use document number. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 399 10.2.2.8.2.5.  Issue  of  partial  on-hand  quantity  from  a  detail.  When  less  than  the total  detail  quantity  is  being  issued  you  must  identify  the  serial  number(s)  you want  to  issue.  Process  a  COMSEC  Serialized  Control  Input-Format  Two  with “MSI”  in  the  first  three  positions  of  the  type  phrase  field  to  load  an  “M”  to  the 250  in-use  serialized  control  record.  After  the  records  are  flagged,  normal  Issue from Detail procedures apply. The 250 in-use serialized control records identified are  deleted  and  a  new  250  in-use  serialized  control  record(s)  is  established  for type  account  E  items  reflecting  the  last  four  positions  of  the  in-use  document number. 10.2.2.8.2.5.1.  When  an  issue  from  a  detail  record  is  processed,  the  issue programs will try to replenish the detail unless an “F” is in position 54 of the issue  from  detail  record  input.  When the  on-hand  balance  is  greater  than  the replenishment  quantity  the  replenishment  issue  will  reject  unless  the applicable  249  serialized  control  records  are  identified  for  issue.  Process  all Issues (from a detail) for serialized control items  with  an F in  position 54 to avoid rejects. 10.2.2.8.2.5.2.  Do  Not  process  an  issue  from  one  detail  to  another  detail. Process  a  return  from  the  “issuing”  detail  to  the item  record  then  process  an issue to the “gaining” detail. 10.2.2.8.3.  Returns. 10.2.2.8.3.1.  Total detail quantity being returned. When the total detail quantity is being returned normal return procedures apply. The 250 in-use serialized control detail  record(s)  is  deleted  and  a  249  serialized  control  detail  record(s)  is established. 10.2.2.8.3.2.  Return  of  partial  quantity  from  a  detail.  When  less  than  the  total detail  quantity  is  being  returned  you  must  identify  the  serial  numbers  being returned.  Process  a  COMSEC  Serialized  Control  Input-Format  Two  with  the phrase  “TURN-IN”  in  the  type  phrase  field  to  load  a  “T”  to  the  250  in-use serialized  control  detail  record.  After  the  records  are  flagged,  normal  return procedures apply. The 250 in-use serialized control detail record(s) will be deleted and 249 serialized control record(s) established. 10.2.2.8.3.3.  Return  of  items  not  on  a  detail.  Process  a  COMSEC  Serialized Control Input-Format Two with “TURN-IN” in the type phrase field to load a 249 serialized  control  detail  record.  After  the  serialized  control  record  is  established normal  return  procedures  apply.  Caution:  COMSEC/CCI  found  on  base  may constitute  a  potential  compromise  of  classified  information  and  will  be  reported immediately upon discovery IAW AFI 16-1404. For NWRM items, see AFI 20-110 for additional reporting instructions. 10.2.2.8.4.  Shipments.  Shipments  from  details  are  not  allowed.  Items  on  in-use serialized control details must be returned to stock before shipment processing. Note: Transfer is authorized for RSP, MSK, SPRAM, Authorized In-Use and WRM details (Transfer Procedures). See Sec. 5D, for Equipment Transfers between SRANs. 10.2.2.8.4.1.  The  maximum  amount  of  serial  numbers  that  can  be  shipped  with 400 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 one input is 50 (fifty). 10.2.2.8.4.2.  For  shipments  of  entire  on-hand  warehouse  balance,  normal shipment procedures apply. 10.2.2.8.4.3.  Shipment  from  a  detail.  Individual  shipments  from  details  are  not allowed. Process a return from the detail  and ship from the item record. Prior to processing the return and shipment, process a COMSEC Serialized Control Input-Format  Two  to  flag  each  serial  number  or  a  615  reject  will  occur  (see  AFH  23-123,  Vol  2,  Pt  1,  Ch  10  for  proper  Type  Phrase  Codes).  Note:  Redistribution Orders/Referrals from MSK and Supply Point Details may be processed. 10.2.2.8.4.4.  Shipment  of  partial  on-hand  quantity.  If  less  than  the  total  detail quantity  is  being  shipped,  identify  the  serial  number(s)  to  ship.  Process  a Weapons Serialized Control  Input-Format  Two  with  the type phrase  ‘ISU/DOR’ to  prepare  the  serialized  control  detail  for  shipment.  Note:  Warner  Robins (WRALC)  is  no  longer  the  storage  site  for  weapons.  Ensure  weapons  being returned to Depot are shipped to the Anniston Army Depot (FY1346) 10.2.2.8.5.  Receipts.  Prior  to  processing  a  REC  for  a  COMSEC  item  you  must process  a  Serialized  COMSEC  Control  Input-Format  Two  with  the  phrase “SHIPPED” in the type phrase field to load the 249 serialized control record. When the receipt transaction is processed a F117 Management Notice is produced. Once the REC  is  processed the Receipt Code field  of the 249 control record is  changed to  an “R”  to  signify  the  property  was  received  and  program  control  will  generate  a COMSEC  Control  Report  to  update  AFEMS  (C001).  If  the  249  control  record(s)  is not  loaded,  when  the  receipt  is  processed,  the  program  will  generate  a  616  Reject. Take action to load the 249 records before the receipt can be reprocessed. Note:  All elements of the 249 record (i.e., suffix code, due-in number, MMAC) must match the REC input or the transaction will reject. 10.2.2.8.6.  Record  reversal  and  correction  Transactions.  Prior  to  these  transactions process  a  serial  Serialized  COMSEC  Control  Input-Format  Two  to  create/delete  the applicable 249/250 serialized control record. 10.2.2.8.7.  Deployment Procedures. 10.2.2.8.7.1.  Deployment of total detail quantity. When the total on-hand quantity of  the  detail  (MRSP,  MSK,  SPRAM,  WRM  or  Authorized  In-use)  is  deployed, normal deployment processing procedures apply. The deployed routing identifier will be stored on the applicable 250 serialized control records. 10.2.2.8.7.2.  Deployment  of  less  than  total  detail  quantity.  When  less  than  the total on hand detail quantity is deployed, process a Serialized COMSEC Control Input-Format  Two  with  type  phrase  “DEPLOY”  to  load  a  “D”  in  the ACTIONCODE  field  of  the  250  record.  After  the  records  are  flagged,  normal deployment  processing  procedures  apply.  Program  control  will  delete  the  “D” from the 250 serialized control record and load the deployed routing identifier to the control records. 10.2.2.8.7.3.  Total  quantity  returned  from  deployment.  When  the  total  deployed AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 401 quantity is returned, normal return deployment processing procedures apply. The deployed  routing  identifier  will  be  deleted  from  the  applicable  250  serialized control records under program control when the return is processed. 10.2.2.8.7.4.  Partial quantity returned from deployment. When less than the total quantity  deployed  is  returned,  process  a  Serialized  COMSEC  Control  Input-Format Two with type phrase “RETURN” to load an “R” in the ACTION-CODE field  of the 250  record.  After the records are flagged, normal  return deployment processing procedures apply. The deployed routing identifier will be deleted from the applicable 250 serialized control records by program control. 10.2.2.8.8.  Transfer Procedures. 10.2.2.8.8.1.  Transfer of total detail quantity. When the total on-hand quantity of the detail (MRSP, MSK, SPRAM, WRM or In-use) is transferred normal transfer processing  procedures  apply.  Daily  Change  Reports  will  be  generated  under program  control  to  update  AFEMS  (C001)  and  AFEMS  (ACOM  screen).  In addition, Daily Change Reports images are created for forwarding to the gaining base to establish 249 serialized control records. 10.2.2.8.8.2.  Transfer  of  less  than  total  detail  quantity.  When  less  than  the  total on-hand  detail  quantity  is  transferred  process  a  Serialized  COMSEC  Control Input-Format  Two  with  type  phrase  “TRANFER”  (Note  the  spelling  of  this phrase) to load a “T” in the 1st position of the ACTION-CODE field of the 250 record.  After  the  records  are  flagged,  normal  transfer  processing  procedures apply.  Daily  Change  Reports  will  be  generated  under  program  control  to  update AFEMS (C001) and AFEMS (ACOM screen). In addition, images are created for forwarding to the gaining base to establish 249 serialized control records. 10.2.3.  Processing  actions  for  Removal/Installation  of  Controlled  Cryptographic  Items (CCI). 10.2.3.1.  Purpose:  Provide  procedures  for  the  processing  and  documentation  of  CCI removal/installation. 10.2.3.2.  Controlled Maintenance activities use AFTO Form 781L, to provide control for serial  number  CCI  and  as  an  aid  in  serial  number  accountability.  See  T.O.  00-20-1  for additional information. 10.2.3.2.1.  When CCI is removed and a like item  is  installed at  a transient  base, an AFTO  Form  781L  is  sent  to  LRS/  Materiel  Management  Activity.  Materiel Management  personnel  will  process  a  COMSEC  Control  Report  (XHA)  for transmission to AFMC Cryptological System Activity.  (T-1).  See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for format. 10.2.3.2.2.  Home  Station  CCI  Removal  Processing  Procedures.  When  an  aircraft  or ground  mobile  communications  center,  etc.,  returns  to  its  home  station,  the  home station  maintenance  activity  forwards  a  copy  of  the  AFTO  Form  781L  to  the  LRS/ Materiel  Management  Activity  COMSEC  monitor.  Process  a  COMSEC  Serialized Control Input-Format Two. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10 for information on applicable ILS-S transaction processing. 402 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 10.2.3.3.  Document Control of CCI Replacements. 10.2.3.3.1.  At the transient base and the home base, Document Control annotates or stamps the “Comments” line with "Received by (signature of Document Control clerk and date)." 10.2.3.3.2.  Forward a copy of the document to the maintenance activity that provided the form to LRS/Materiel Management Activity. 10.2.3.3.3.  File the form for 2 years from the date received by the Document Control personnel. 10.2.3.4.  The  following  results  when  all  actions  have  been  properly  completed  by  the transient base and the home base: 10.2.3.4.1.  The  transient  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  home  base  serial number  now  belongs  to  the  transient  base,  and  serialized  control  transactions  were prepared accordingly. 10.2.3.4.2.  The  home  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  transient  base  serial number  now  belongs  to  the  home  base,  and  serialized  control  transactions  were prepared accordingly. 10.2.3.4.3.  The AFMC  Cryptological  System Activity CCI formerly located at  base A is now located at base B, and the CCI formerly located at base B is now located at base A. 10.2.4.  Documentation  of  Transfer  of  CCI  Assets  from  Base  Level  Maintenance Organizations to Depot Level. 10.2.4.1.  Purpose: To provide procedures for the documentation of transfer of CCI assets from base maintenance organizations to depot level. 10.2.4.2.  When an aircraft must be sent to a repair depot for maintenance and a CCI asset is aboard, the home base maintenance activity reports this by AFTO Form 781L. 10.2.4.2.1.  The LRS/Materiel Management Activity COMSEC monitor at the losing base enters the NSN and serial number in the COMSEC Control Report in positions 8-37 and leaves positions 38-67 blank. The host LRS/Materiel Management Activity COMSEC monitor of the repair depot will enter the same NSN and serial number in positions  38-67  and  leave  positions  8-37  blank.  This  combined  processing  action notifies The AFMC Cryptological System Activity that a CCI asset formerly located at a using base is now located at a repair depot. The host LRS/Materiel Management Activity  at  AFMC  depots  will  follow  the  procedures  in  AFMC  regulations  for obtaining the required information from the depot. 10.2.4.2.2.  Other  Service  Performed  Maintenance.  When  a  CCI  is  removed  and replaced  at  another-service  installation  (Army,  Navy,  etc.),  the  home  base maintenance activity forwards the completed AFTO Form 781L to the LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  COMSEC  monitor.  The  monitor  prepares  COMSEC  Control Report (XHA) for transaction processing (See AFH 23-122, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 10). The other-service  installation  reports  the  serial  number  change  to  their  central  office  of record using their own established procedures. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 403 10.2.5.

administrative lead time and production lead time. Active  Inventory—Materiel  that  is  expected  to  be  consumed  within  the  budget  year  (2  years) and materiel that has been purchased to meet specific war reserve requirements. Actual  Unit  Price—The  latest  contract  price  plus  inflation  and  first  destination  transportation costs. This price is intended to approximate the price the item will cost on next acquisition. Additive  Requirement—Requirements  that  are  supported  by  projected  requirements  (e.g., modifications)  rather  than  past  demand  experience.  Requirements  computed  outside  the recoverable computation. Aircraft  Parts  Store—LRS  function  located  near  flight  line  maintenance  and  functions  as  a demand  processing  unit,  customer  support,  and  aircraft  parts  warehouse  for  maintenance activities. Aircraft  Sustainability  Model  (ASM)—The  mathematical  model  used  to  determine  the requirements  for  recoverable  RSP  items  (in  the  D087G  system)  It  uses  a  unit's  wartime  flying hour  program,  the  range  of  items  determined  at  the  annual  review,  and  the  demand rate/indicative data for each item to determine the optimum mix of spares to achieve the target direct support objective (DSO). Allowance  Standard  (AS)—Authorized  document  that  identifies  the  amount  and  type  of equipment for an organization. Approved  Acquisition  Objective  (AAO)—The  quantity  of  an  item  authorized  for  peacetime and wartime requirements to equip and sustain U.S. and Allied Forces, according to current DoD policies and plans. That quantity shall be sufficient to support other U.S. Government Agencies, as applicable. Awaiting Parts (AWP)—During the repair process for systems/equipment, parts are ordered for the system/equipment  undergoing  repair or an  end item  is  being scheduled for a repair process and parts are ordered for a scheduled repair of the system/equipment to start the repair process. The end item system/equipment undergoing repair/being scheduled for repair is AWP when the parts to continue the repair process are backordered or the scheduled repair process will exceed mission requirements. Base  Condemnation  Rate—The number of base condemnations divided by the sum base RTS and base condemnations. Base Consumption Rates—Base consumption rates will be determined by taking the number of failures  at  base level,  over  a specific period of time, divided by the operating program for that same time period. 426 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Base  Not  Repairable  this  Station  (NRTS)  Rate—The number of  Base NRTS divided by the sum of the base RTS, base NRTS, and base condemnations. Base  Repair  Cycle—The  number  of  days  that  elapse  between  the  time  an  unserviceable reparable item is removed from use and the time it is made serviceable and ready for issue. Base Stock Level—This level is computed in support of the base requisitioning objective Bench  Stocks—Stores  of  expendability,  recoverability,  reparability  coded  (ERRC)  XB3  items kept on-hand in a work center to enhance maintenance productivity. Business  Overhead  Cost  Recovery  (BOCR)—BOCR@LAC/LRC  is  the  portion  of  the  cost recovery element that represents indirect and direct overhead costs. Examples are various Supply Operations  Costs,  DLADS,  DISA,  DFAS,  Materiel  Inflation,  AORs,  DLA  distribution issue/receipts costs, and transportation costs. BOCR is applied as a flat percentage, to the LAC and the LRC, across all NSNs. C-Factor—Multiplier of the standard deviation (square root of the variance) of demand during replenishment.  The  ILS-S  uses  the  C-factor  to  selectively  increase  item  special  level  quantities for  stocked  items.  The  C-factor  assignment  policy  is  based  on  item  mission  impact,  historical demand and unit price criteria. Calendar Time Change Items—Items requiring replacement at regular intervals as specified in appropriate technical orders. Carcass Cost (CC)—The value of an asset when the LRC plus BOCR have been removed from the standard price of the item. Carcass cost is also equal to the LAC minus the LRC. Care of Supplies in Storage (COSIS)—Program composed of a set of processes and procedures whose purpose is to ensure that materiel in storage is maintained in ready-for-issue condition or to prevent uneconomic deterioration of unserviceable materiel. Cataloging—Act of naming, classifying, describing, and numbering each item repetitively used, purchased, stocked, or distributed to distinguish each item from every other item. Also included is the maintenance of information related to the item and the dissemination of that information to item users. Cataloging Tools—The process of initiating and enhancing documents and procedures required to research, record, and organize logistics information. Central  Procurement—The  purchase  of  materiel,  supplies  or  services  by  an  officially designated  command  or  agency  with  funds  specifically  provided  for  such  procurement  for  the benefit and use of the entire component or the military departments as a whole. Central  Secondary  Item  Stratification  (CSIS)—An  automated  capability  that  applies  to wholesale and retail asset and requirements data. The CSIS shall uniformly display the materiel requirements and  associated asset status  of individual secondary items  and generate summaries of essential information. When a methodology other than stratification is used as a foundation, an audit  trail  to  the  applicable  stratification  table  shall  be  submitted  to  the  USD  (L&MR). Secondary  item  assets  shall  be  stratified  at  least  semiannually.  One  stratification  shall  be  as  of September 30 (for inventory reporting and funding reviews), and the other shall be as of March 31 (for budget preparation). AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 427 Classes of Supply—Not to be confused with Federal Supply Class, terminology used to divide supplies  and  equipment  into  10  easily  identifiable  categories  of  materiel  that  are  depicted  by Roman Numerals. Classified  Item—Controlled  inventory  item/materiel  that  require  protection  in  the  interest  of national security. Commodity—A homogeneous aggregation of like items. Communications-Electronics—Specialized  field  items  concerned  with  the  use  of  electronic devices  and  systems  for  the  acquisition,  acceptance,  processing,  storage,  display,  analysis, protection, disposition, and transfer of information. Condemnation Requirement—Stock replacements for base and depot condemnations Consumable  Item—Item  of  supply  (except  explosive  ordnance  and  major  end  items  of equipment)  that  is  normally  expended  or  used  up  beyond  recovery  in  the  use  for  which  it  is designed or intended. Minor parts, tools, and hardware identified by ERRC designator XB3. NF1 items  (with  IEX  E,  K)  are  managed  like  consumable  items.  A  consumable  item  cannot  be economically  repaired  by  a  field  or  depot  maintenance  activity.  Accountability  for  consumable items are terminated upon issue. Contract  Termination—The  cessation  or  cancellation,  in  whole  or  in  part,  of  work  under  a prime contractor a subcontract for the convenience of, or at the option of, the government, or due to failure of the contractor to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. Coordination—The  necessary  action  to  ensure  adequate  exchange  of  information  to  integrate, synchronize,  and  deconflict  operations  between  separate  organizations.  Coordination  is  not necessarily  a  process  of  gaining  approval  but  is  most  often  used  for  mutual  exchange  of information. Critical  Safety  Item—Means  a  part,  an  assembly,  installation  equipment,  launch  equipment, recovery equipment, or support equipment for an aircraft or aviation weapon system if the part, assembly  or  equipment  contains  a  characteristic  any  failure,  malfunction,  or  absence  of  which could  cause  a  catastrophic  or  critical  failure  resulting  in  the  loss  of  or  serious  damage  to  the aircraft  or  weapon  system,  an  unacceptable  risk  of  personal  injury  or  loss  of  life,  or  an uncommanded engine shutdown that jeopardizes safety. Customer Oriented Leveling Technique—Used to centrally compute levels for DLA-managed items that have an established demand pattern. Daily  Demand  Frequency  Rate  (DDFR)—The  DDFR  reflects  the  average  daily  number  of customer  requests  for  an  item.  The  DDFR  differs  from  DDR  in  that  DDFR  is  based  on  the number  of  customer  orders  (requests),  while  DDR  is  based  the  number  of  units  of  stock requested. DDFR is calculated by dividing the sum of customer requests by the number of days since the item’s Date of First Demand (DOFD). Daily  Demand  Rate—Average quantity of an item that is used daily. The ILS-S computes the DDR  using  one  of  the  following  methods:  (1)  Bachelor  or  Substitute  Item.  Divide  the  item cumulative  recurring  demand  (CRD)  by  the  difference  of  the  current  Julian  date  minus  the DOFD.  If the demand experience available is  less  than 180 days, a difference of 180 mitigates the  effect  of  limited  demand  experience.  (2)  Master  or  Interchangeable  Item.  Divide  the cumulative  recurring  demand  (CRD)  for  the  master  and  all  interchangeable  items  within  the 428 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 group (for one system designator at a time) by the difference of the current Julian date minus the oldest  date  of  first  demand  in  the  master/interchangeable  group.  When  the  demand  experience available is less than 180 days, a difference of 180 days mitigates the effect of limited demand experience. Data Dissemination—Various products and events provide logistics information to customers at every level of the supply system. Data  Entry  and  Maintenance  Transactions—Those  actions  necessary  to  ensure  complete, accurate  and  current  logistics  data  records  (excluding  item  characteristics  data)  for  an  item  of supply. Defense  Inactive  Item  Program  (DIIP)—The  systematic  elimination  of  inactive  items  of supply from DoD materiel management systems and the Federal Catalog System. Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services (DLADS)—Field activity of the DLA charged with  the  responsibility  of  managing  all  aspects  of  the  process  of  receiving,  storing,  marketing, redistributing,  and  disposing  of  all  materiel  determined  by  elements  of  the  DoD  materiel management structure to be excess to the needs of a DoD activity. Demand—An indication of a requirement (requisition, request, issue, and reparable generation; etc.)  for  issue  of  serviceable  materiel.  Demands  are  categorized  as  either  "recurring"  or "nonrecurring." Demand Level—Stock level for a specific item that is based upon past user demands. Demand-Support Items—Items that are stocked based on forecasted usage. Demand-supported items  are  stocked  with  demand-based  requirements  on  the  basis  of  economics  or  with  limited demand requirements on basis of military mission essentiality. Demilitarization—Act  of  destroying  the  functional  or  military  capabilities  of  certain  types  of equipment  or  material  that  has  been  screened  through  inventory  control  points  and  declared surplus or foreign excess. Items that are subject to demilitarization include defense articles on the United States Munitions List, as provided by Section 38 of the "Arms Export Control Act" (22 CFR  121  (reference  (aj))).  Also  included  are  items  on  the  Commerce  Control  List  of  the Department  of  Commerce  (15  CFR  774  (reference  (ak))),  and  items  on  the  United  States Munitions  Import  List  of  the  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco,  and  Firearms  of  the  Department  of Treasury.  That  term  includes  mutilating,  cutting,  crushing,  scrapping,  melting,  burning,  or otherwise  altering  to  prevent  the  further  use  of  that  equipment  or  material  for  its  originally intended  purpose,  and  applies  equally  to  equipment  or  material  in  serviceable  or  unserviceable condition. Depot  Consumption  Rates—The number of failures at  depot  level divided by the appropriate depot program. Depot  Level  Maintenance  (DLM)—Maintenance  performed  on  materiel  requiring  major overhaul or a complete rebuild of parts, assemblies, subassemblies, and end items, including the manufacture of parts, modifications, testing and reclamation as required. Depot-Level Reparable Item—A reparable item of supply that is designated for repair at depot level or that is designated for repair below the depot level, but if repair cannot be accomplished at  that  level,  shall  have  its  unserviceable  carcass  is  either  forwarded  to  the  depot  for  repair  or condemnation, or reported to the ICP for disposition. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 429 Depot  Stock  Levels—Depot  stock  levels  represent  those  levels  that  are  required  in  support  of depot  overhaul  requirements.  These  are  subdivided  into  two  categories,  job-routed  (JR)  and nonjob-routed (NJR) stock levels. JR items are those items that are repaired as part of a higher assembly repair. The stock level in support of JR overhaul requirements represents the amount of stock  required  to  prevent  delay  of  programmed  overhauls  during  the  subassembly  O&ST.  NJR items are those items that are removed during an overhaul and turned into supply. The NJR stock level  requirement  represents  the  quantity  of  stock  required  to  support  the  overhaul  line  during subassembly O&ST. Design  Control  Activity—With  respect  to  an  aviation  critical  safety  item,  means  the  systems command of a military department that is specifically responsible for ensuring the airworthiness of an aviation system or equipment in which the item is to be used.’ Donations—Donable property under the control of a Military Service and/or a Defense Agency authorized for donation by statute to an authorized donee.

Expendability,  Recoverability,  Reparability  Category  Designator  (ERRCD)—Cataloging element  that  indicates  whether  an  item  can  be  economically  repaired  and  what  level  (base  or depot) has the authority to condemn an item. Federal Supply Class (FSC)—Series of 4 numerals at the beginning of the NSN that designates the general commodity grouping of the item of supply. Force Activity Designator (FAD)—Roman numeral (I to V) that the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff,  or  a  DoD  Component  assigns  to  a  unit,  organization, installation,  project,  or  program  to  indicate  its  relative  mission  essentiality.  The  FAD  is  an integral part of the UMMIPS. 430 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Forward Supply Location (FSL)—Part of the AMC’s Forward Supply System and serves as an intermediate stockage location in the AMC Strategic Airlift route structure. Candidate NSNs for stockage at the FSLs are applicable to the C-5 and C-17 strategic airlift. Found  on  Base  (FOB)—Assets  that  are  in  the  possession  of  base  customers  that  are  not correctly  accounted  for  on  supply  system  due-in  from  maintenance  or  in-use  equipment  detail records are commonly referred to as found on base. Function  Checks—Function Checks consist  of  supply assets  requiring  maintenance check and may fall into either of two categories: 1) Assets (other than buildup items) requiring functional check, operational programming or calibration before installation. Maintenance units will submit a  list  of  functional  check  items  IAW  AFI  21—101.  2)  LRS  accountable  assets  for  which serviceability  is  in  question  (i.e.  assets  that  appear  to  have  been  mishandled  while  in  stock, dropped, etc. or assets received in a suspect condition). Government-Furnished  Materiel  (GFM)—Materiel  owned  by  the  U.S.  Government  and furnished to a contractor to use for specific contract purposes. Title to all materiel furnished by the  U.S.  Government  remains  with  the  U.S.  Government.  GFM  is  property  that  may  be incorporated into or attached to a deliverable end item or that may be consumed or expended in performing  a  contract.  GFM  does  not  include  materiel  sold  by  the  U.S.  Government  to  a contractor. Hazardous  Materiel  (HAZMAT)—Item  of  supply  consisting  of  materiel  that  because  of  its quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical,  or infectious characteristics, may either cause or significantly  contribute  to  an  increase  in  mortality  or  an  increase  in  serious,  irreversible,  or incapacitating reversible illness; or pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or  the  environment  when  improperly  treated,  stored,  transported,  disposed  of,  or  otherwise managed. Holding Costs—Those costs associated with the cost of capital, inventory losses, obsolescence, storage, and other variable costs of maintaining an inventory. Inbound  Cargo—All  actions  taken  by  a  receiving  activity  from  the  physical  turnover  of materiel by a carrier until the on-hand balance of the accountable stock record file or in-process receipt  file  is  updated  to  reflect  the  received  materiel  as  an  asset  in  storage,  or  the  materiel  is issued directly from receiving to the customer. Initial Spares—Spares stocked to support a newly fielded weapon system or a modification of a weapon system. Insurance Item—A non-demand-based, stocked, essential item for which no failure is predicted through  normal  usage.  However,  if  a  failure  were  to  be  experienced,  or  a  loss  should  occur through accident, abnormal equipment or system failure, or other unexpected occurrence, lack of replacement item will seriously hamper the operational capability of a weapon system. Integrated  Materiel  Manager  (IMM)—Any  DoD  activity  or  Agency  that  has  been  assigned integrated wholesale materiel management responsibility for the DoD and participating Federal Agencies.  Integrated  wholesale  materiel  management  responsibilities  include  requirements determination, procurement, distribution, overhaul and repair of reparable materiel, and disposal of materiel. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 431 Interchangeable  and  Substitution  Group—Set  of  items  that  have  similar  physical  and functional  characteristics  to  the  extent  that  the  items  can  provide  comparable  functional performance against a given requirement. Interchangeable Items—An item that possesses such functional and physical characteristics as to  be  equivalent  in  performance,  reliability,  and  maintainability,  to  another  item  of  similar  or identical purposes, and is capable of being exchanged for the other item without selection for fit or  performance,  and  without  alteration  of  the  item  itself  or  of  adjoining  items,  except  for adjustment. Intransit  Assets—Materiel  that  is  between  storage  locations,  either  wholesale  or  retail,  or materiel shipped from vendors after acceptance by the U.S. Government, but not yet received by the  inventory  manager.  Intransit  assets  are  not  included  in  the  records  of  wholesale  inventory used in the stratification process. Inventory—Materiel,  titled  to  the  U.S.  Government,  held  for  sale  or  issue,  held  for  repair,  or held pending transfer to disposal. Inventory  Control  Point  (ICP)—An  organizational  unit  or  activity  within  the  DoD  materiel management system that is assigned the primary responsibility for the materiel management of a group  of  items  either  for  a  particular  Military  Service  or  for  the  Department  of  Defense  as  a whole. In addition to IMM functions, an ICP may perform other logistics functions in support of a particular Military Service or for a particular end item (e.g., centralized computation of retail requirements levels and engineering tasks associated with weapon system components). Inventory Position—Sum of the on-hand asset quantity and the quantity already on order, minus any existing customer backorder quantity. Item  Entry  Control  (IEC)—Item  entry  control  is  a  process  where  the  cataloging  agent examines potential items for inclusion in the FCP. A determination is made by screening the part number  (PN)  of  the  candidate  item  with  existing  items  to  see  if  a  previously  existing  item  can used  in  its  place.  The  previously  existing  item  will  be  coordinated  with  the  AF  Equipment Specialist (ES) for acceptance. Item  Management  Coding  (IMC)—The  process  of  determining  whether  items  of  supply qualify  for  management  by  the  military  Services,  rather  than  by  DLA  or  General  Services Administration (GSA), according to DoD 4140.26-M, Defense Integrated Material Management Manual at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/414026m.html. Consumable for Items Item Unique Identification (IUID)—A system of marking items delivered to DoD with unique item  identifiers  that  have  machine-readable  data  elements  to  distinguish  an  item  from  all  other like and unlike items. Latest Acquisition Cost (LAC)—The price paid for an item the last time it was procured from a supplier. The LAC is generally the latest representative contract price obtained. However, it can be based on an earlier buy if that latest procurement is considered non-representative. The LAC does not include any cost recovery or inflation. Latest  Repair  Cost  (LRC)—The  current  year  depot  repair  EISP.  The  LRC  is  either  obtained from the depot maintenance pricing systems or is a value adjusted by the Inventory Manager or 432 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Production Manager based on updated information. When a new item with no reparable history is established, the LRC is systemically calculated at 25 percent of the LAC. Launch  Kits—Launch  kits  are  a  type  of  mobile  supply  point.  Launch  kits  contain  a  limited range of spare parts kept in  a maintenance vehicle where they  will be immediately  available if malfunctions occur during the final phases of an aircraft prelaunch sequence. When a launch kit is required, establish supply point details for the quantities needed. Logistic  Reassignment—Transfer of integrated materiel management responsibilities from one manager to another. Local Secondary Item Stratification (LSIS)—Is prepared when asset and/or requirements data is not prepared by an automated process. LSIS shall uniformly display the materiel requirements and  associated  asset  status  of  individual  secondary  items  and  generate  summaries  of  essential information. Low  Density  Level  (LDL)—Term  used  to  describe  adjusted  stock  levels  for  non-airborne communications-electronic  (C-E)  Nuclear  Command,  Control,  Communication  (NC3)  systems space,  weather,  and  ground-based  launched  missile  system  items.  LDLs  may  be  utilized  to preposition critical assets on forward supply points near the supported system whenever possible. These  levels  are  also  established  for  items  having  very  low  usage  (low  daily  demand),  erratic demand patterns, or long Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) rates. LRS/Materiel  Management  Activities—Organizations who perform both retail and wholesale materiel management functions. Mark-Up Price-(MUP)—The difference between the standard price and the exchange price that is added to the exchange price customer account if an unserviceable asset is not returned to the materiel management inventory. This price is a penalty paid by a customer if a DIFM asset is not returned within 60 days. The MUP will be reimbursed upon receipt of a reparable asset to clear the DIFM detail record after 60 days. Materiel—All  items  (including  ships,  tanks,  self-propelled  weapons,  and  aircraft;  etc.  and related spares, repair parts, and support equipment, but excluding real property, installations, and utilities) necessary to equip, operate, maintain, and support military activities without distinction as to its application for administrative or combat purposes. Materiel is either serviceable (i.e. in an issuable condition) or unserviceable (i.e. in need of repair to make it serviceable). Materiel  Cost  Recovery  (MCR)—The  portion  of  each  exchange  price  sale  that  will  pay  for items  needed  to  be  purchased  for  customer  support.  The  MCR  represents  the  constrained extended  year  buy  portion;  the  constraint  being  that  it  cannot  be  more  than  the  customer  is funded. Materiel  Management—Continuing  actions  relating  to  planning,  organizing,  directing, coordinating, controlling, and evaluating the application of resources to ensure the effective and economical  support  of  military  forces.  It  includes  provisioning,  cataloging,  requirements determination,  acquisition,  distribution,  maintenance,  and  disposal.  The  terms  "materiel management,"  "materiel  control,"  "inventory  control,"  "inventory  management,"  and  "supply management" are synonymous. Materiel Manager—See integrated materiel manager. AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 433 Measures  and  Indicators—Encompassing  term  for  the  various  criteria  used  to  evaluate progress within the assessment process.

Mission  Capability  (MICAP)—Failure  of  the  system/equipment  prevents  performance  of  the required mission. The end item system/equipment mission capability is identified by the system reporting  designator  (SRD)  as  MICAP.  The  designation  MICAP  is  provided  by  maintenance activity. Minimum  Replacement  Unit  (MRU)—The  minimum  quantity  of  an  item  normally  replaced during a maintenance action, often the quantity of a component used for each end item. Mission  Impact  Code  (MIC)—Values  of  1  through  4  are  assigned  programmatically  to  all consumable  and  recoverable  item  records  during  the  issue  process  based  upon  the  UJC  of customer issue requests, not customer backorders (this is an important distinction that ensures all demanded  items  are  assigned  appropriate  MICs  even  when  customer  requests  are  issued  from shelf  stock  upon  demand).  MICs  are  never  programmatically  downgraded,  but  are  upgraded  to reflect the priority of subsequent higher priority customer demands. National  Stock  Number  (NSN)—13-digit  stock  number  used  to  identify  items  of  supply.  It consists of a 4-digit FSC and a 9-digit National Item Identification Number (NIIN). Negotiated Level—When the quantities computed at base level do not provide adequate support, the MAJCOM may negotiate a special level with the prime inventory management specialist.

Operating  Level  of  Supply—The  quantity  of  materiel  required  to  sustain  operations  in  the interval between requisitions or the arrival of successive shipments. 434 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Operating Requirement—Ensures that all assets removed due to failure will be replaced at the time  of  removal.  It  is  computed  by  multiplying  the  organizational/intermediate  (OIM)  demand rate by the operating program. Partially  Redistributable  Materiel—The  quantity  of  the  on-hand  serviceable  balance  that exceeds the base stockage requirements. Peculiar  item—An  item  that  cannot  proven  to  have  similar  form,  fit,  and  function;  or  similar components  with  minor  differences  not  confirmed  through  a  comparison  of  part  number, technical order, and figure and index. CAGE code, cataloging data, and agreement/disagreement by the SOS are not determination factors. Percent of Base Repair (PBR)—Percentage is the average base repair rate for the item over the current and past four quarters. The  ILS-S calculates the PBR using RTS (repaired this station), NRTS, and condemnation data from the repair cycle record. Pilferable  Item—Controlled inventory item/materiel having a ready resale value or application to personal possession, which is especially subject to theft. Potential  Reutilization/Disposal  Materiel—DoD  Component  materiel  identified  by  an  item   manager  for  possible  disposal,  but  with  potential  for  reutilization;  or  materiel  that  has  the potential for being sent by an item manager to the DLADS for possible reutilization by another DoD  Component  or  by  a  Federal,  State,  or  local  governmental  agency,  or  for  disposal  through sale to the public. Precious  Metals  Indicator—Identifies defense materiel items that contain precious metals and indicates the content value of the metal. Primary Supply Points (PSP)—PSPs are established at selected locations to provide primarily built-up wheel and tires support to each AMC Forward Supply Locations (FSL). Proactive  Demand  Leveling  (PDL)—Tool that  uses global  demand data to  centrally  compute and  maintain  levels  for  DLA-managed  items  that  have  no  demand  level  and  little  or  no established demand pattern. It proactively lays-in Adjusted Stock Levels (ASL) at one base using demand data from other bases that operate the same weapon system. Procurement Lead Time (PCLT)—The interval between the initiation of a procurement action and receipt of the products or services purchased as the result of such action. Production  Lead  Time  (PLT)—The  time  interval  between  the  letting  of  a  contract  or  the placing of an order, and receiving the purchased materiel into the supply system. Provisioning—Management  process  of  determining  and  acquiring  the  range  and  quantity  of support items necessary to operate and maintain an end item of materiel for an initial period of service. Provisioning  Screening  Review  and  Support—Those  actions  taken  to  facilitate  the  best selection,  procurement,  and  cataloging  of  items  of  supply  required  to  sustain  weapons  systems and  other  government  requirements  (e.g.,  technical  data  validation,  data  calls,  provisioning, guidance conferences, Logistics Support Analysis conferences, etc.). Readiness—A  measure  or  measures  of  the  ability  of  a  system  to  undertake  and  sustain  a specified  set  of  missions  at  planned  peacetime  and  wartime  utilization  rates.  Measures  take account of the effects of system design (reliability and maintainability), the characteristics of the AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 435 support  system,  and  the  quantity  and  location  of  support  resources.  Examples  of  system readiness  measures  are  combat  sortie  rate,  fully  mission  capable  rate,  and  operational availability. Reclamation—Process  of  reclaiming  required  serviceable  and  economically  repairable components  and  material  from  excess  or  surplus  property  for  return  to  the  proper  Materiel Management Activity, whereas the residue is processed as "disposable property." Reorder  Point  (ROP)—Point  that,  when  an  item's  inventory  position  (i.e.  on-hand  stock  plus stock due-in minus stock due-out) reaches or breaches, triggers an order to replenish stock. Repair Cycle Assets—Any recoverable item with an ERRCD code of XD or XF. Repair Cycle Demand Level (RCDL)—Pipeline stockage model that seeks to fill the Order and Shipping Time (O&ST), the base repair cycle time (RCT), and the base NRTS condemned time (NCT)  pipelines.  Because  each  of  those  pipeline  segments  and  customer  demand  are  variable, the RCDL also includes a safety level quantity. The RCDL also includes an EOQ component for selected XF3 items. Repair Cycle Process—Process to establish firm control of all unserviceable repair cycle assets from  the  time  they  are  generated  until  the  time  they  are  returned  to  the  LRS/Materiel Management  Activity  as  serviceable  or  unserviceable.  Repair  cycle  time  start  when  the  DIFM item is issued to the customer, and ends when the item (serviceable or unserviceable) is returned to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. Reparable Item—An item that can be repaired at either depot or field level. Replenishment—Actions  to  resupply  an  inventory  when  the  inventory  position  reaches  the reorder point. Requirements  Computation—Any  mathematical requirements determination functions. calculation  performed to support Requisition—An  order  for  materiel  initiated  by  an  established,  authorized  organization  that  is transmitted either electronically, by mail, or telephoned to a materiel management source within or external (i.e. sister services, DLA, etc.)to the AF. Requisitioning Objective (RO)—Maximum quantity of materiel to be maintained on hand and on order to sustain current operations and core war reserves. It shall consist of the sum of stocks represented  by  the  operating  level,  safety  level,  repair  cycle,  if  applicable,  the  OST  level,  and authorized additive levels. Retail—Level  of  inventory  below  the  wholesale  level,  either  at  the  consumer  level  (directly supporting customers) or at the intermediate level (supporting a geographical area). Retail  Inventory—Level  of  inventory  below  the  wholesale  level,  either  at  the  consumer  level (directly  supporting  customers)  or  at  the  intermediate  level  (supporting  a  geographical  area). Retail-Level  Supply—Those  secondary  items  stored  within  DoD  intermediate  and  consumer levels  of  supply  down  to  and  including  the  LRS.  Retail-level  supply  does  not  include  end  use secondary item materiel. Retail  Stock—Stock  held  in  the  custody  or  on  the  records  of  a  supply  organization  below  the wholesale level. 436 AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 Safety  Level  Quantity—Designed  to  increase  item  stock  levels  in  a  way  that  protects  ILS-S customers  of  stocked  items  from  variations  in  O&ST  and  demand  during  replenishment  lead time. Sensitive Item—Controlled inventory item/materiel that requires a high degree of protection and control  due  to  statutory  requirements  or  regulations,  such  as  narcotics  and  drug  abuse  items; precious metals; items of high value, highly technical, or hazardous nature; and small arms and ammunition. Shelf-Life  Item—Item  of  supply  possessing  deteriorative  or  unstable  characteristics  to  the degree that a storage time period shall be assigned to ensure that it shall perform satisfactorily in service. Special  Access  Program  (SAP)—Under  the  authority  of  Executive  Order  12356  and  as implemented by the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) Directive No. 1, any program created by  an agency head whom the President has designated in  the Federal  Register to  be an original  TOP  SECRET  classification  authority  that  imposes  "need-to-know"  or  access  controls beyond  those  the  DoD  normally  requires  for  access  to  CONFIDENTIAL,  SECRET,  or  TOP SECRET  Information.  Such  a  program  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  special  clearance, adjudication,  or  investigative  requirements;  special  designation  of  officials  authorized  to determine need-to-know; or lists of persons who actually have a need-to-know. Standard  Price  (SP)—The  price  customers  are  charged  which,  for  DoD  ICP  managed  items (excluding  subsistence),  remains  constant  throughout  a  fiscal  year  except  for  the  correction  of significant errors. This price includes the LAC plus the BOCR@LAC. Standardization—AF standardization operations are conducted primarily within the framework of  the  Defense  Standardization  Program  (DSP)  and  IAW  DoD  4120.24-M,  DoD  Defense Standardization  Program  Policies  and  Procedures  Manual.  The  main  objectives  are  to  achieve and  maintain  the  highest  practicable  degree  of  standardization  for  items,  materiel,  practices, procedures, and terminology by preparing standardization documents. In addition to participating in the DSP, the AF standardization mission entails the conduct of, and participation in, various other  related  programs  and  projects,  including  International  Standardization  Programs,  Non-Government Standards (NGS) Bodies, Parts Control Programs, and Overpricing Programs. Stock  Fund—Revolving  fund  established  to  finance  the  costs  of  inventories  of  supplies.  It  is authorized  by  specific  provision  of  law  to  finance  a  continuing  cycle  of  operations. Reimbursements and collections derived from such operations are available for use by the  fund without further action by the Congress. Stock Level—Demand level or an adjusted level. Stockage  Priority  Code  (SPC)—ILS-S  programmatically  assigns  SPCs  to  consumable  items. The  requirements  program  uses  SPCs  to  help  determine  when  the  items  should  be  stocked  for future use. SPCs are also used to prevent item stockage. Stratification  Process—A  uniform  portrayal  of  requirements  and  assets  application  that  is  a computer  generated,  time-phased  simulation  of  actions  causing  changes  in  the  supply  position; e.g., procurement, repair, receipt, issue, termination, and disposal of materiel. Substitutable  Item—An  item  possessing  functional  and  physical  characteristics  that  make  it capable  of  being  exchanged  for  another  only  under  specified  conditions  or  for  particular AFMAN23-122  14 DECEMBER 2016 437 applications  and  without  alteration  of  the  items  themselves  or  of  adjoining  items.

Supply  Chain  Operations  Reference  Model  (SCOR)—Commercially  based  supply  chain integration  model  used  to  describe  business  activities  associated  with  all phases  of  satisfying  a customer  demand.  The  model  is  organized  around  the  five  primary  management  processes  of Plan,  Source,  Make/Maintain,  Deliver,  and  Return.  By  describing  supply  chains  using  these building blocks, the model  may be used to  describe supply  chains  that  are very  simple or very complex using a common set of definitions. Supply  Point—Additional  warehouses  located  within  or  next  to  the  activities  they  support. Assets  maintained  on  supply  points  are  accounted  for  and  controlled  on  a  supply  point  detail record in the ILS-S. Supply  Support  Request  (SSR)  Processing—A  request  by  a  Materiel  Management  Activity making  them  a  user  of  a  consumable/field  repairable  item  managed  by  another  Materiel Management Activity. Total Asset Visibility—The capability to provide users with timely and accurate information on the  location,  movement,  status,  and  identity  of  units,  personnel,  equipment,  materiel,  and supplies.  It  also  includes  the  capability  to  act  upon  that  information  to  improve  overall performance of the Department of Defense’s logistic practices. Also called TAV.  An integrated structure using a command and control process to ensure the quantity, condition, and location of critical assets are visible. Total OIM Demand Rate—The rate at which an item has failed. It is developed by dividing the sum of the base repaired this station (RTS), base not reparable this station (NRTS), and the base condemnations by the item past program for the period. Totally  Redistributable  Materiel—Exists  when  a  base  has  serviceable  shelf  stock  for  items with no historical demand data or base peacetime need (no demand driven or ASL), or when a base has unserviceable assets located in the warehouse. Turnaround  (TRN)—The means to record demand data in the ILS-S for either repair in place or removal, repair, reinstallation of a recoverable item without ordering a replacement item. Unserviceable  Asset  Price  (UAP)—The  price  charged  to  a  customer  to  purchase  an unserviceable asset from the ICP. It includes the carcass cost of the unserviceable asset plus the BOCR. UAP is also equal to the Standard Price minus the LRC. Variable  Safety  Level—A  quantity  of  materiel  stored  in  addition  to  the  operating  level  of supply.  It  is  required  to  be  on  hand  to  permit  continuous  operations  in  the  event  of  minor interruption of normal replenishment or unpredictable fluctuations in demand. War  Reserve  Materiel—Materiel  required  to  equip  and  support  the  approved  forces  specified under  Secretary  of  Defense  guidelines  through  the  prescribed  period  for  war  materiel  planning purposes.
