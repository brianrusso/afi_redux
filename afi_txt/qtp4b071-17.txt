Determine method for trend analysis.1 2.  Determine type of analysis you are performing.2 3.  Identify trends. 4.  Determine what trend indicates.   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  NOTES:  1.  Methods are statistical or visual.  Visual is recommended for scenario provided.  Visual is most useful for tracking/visualizing significant changes over time and is generally used with several data points are collected over time from the same location.  Statistical is most useful when looking for minor differences between samples and is generally used with several samples taken from various locations.  2.  If multiple samples at a single location over time were collected, you will most likely be interested in identifying changes over time.  Visual statistical analysis can be done with several methods including histograms, graphs, time series plot, and spatial data plots.  A histogram reflects data by separating them into groups such by location, type of sample, or another identifying characteristic. This graphical technique provides a visual method of identifying the underlying distribution of the data and is commonly shown as a bar graph.  It is generally used to shown extremes and get assess the shape and spread of data, but details are lost.  Time Series plot reflects data over time.  This is useful for tracking both large and small trends and is the recommended visual statistical analysis tool for this scenario, since our scenario is attempting to identify trends over time.  Spatial data plots, also called a posting plot, compare data values to map locations. It is used to mark the highest and lowest values of the data to identify any obvious trends.  This is useful when tracking trends across multiple sampling locations.      AFQTP 4B071-17                                          Craftsman Training Guide:  Trend Analysis TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS  STS Line Item 4.16.2:  Develop trend analyses from results of Environmental Health Data 1.

Why was visual statistical analysis better for this scenario?  A:  If multiple samples at a single location over time were collected, you will most likely be interested in identifying changes over time.   (Source:  4B051 CDC)   2.  List two reasons why you should perform environmental health data trend analysis.   A:  A trend analysis is useful for identifying changes in COCs over time and/or spatial variations in COCs over an area of concern. A trend analysis can assist with answering questions about site contamination like: Is the environment of the site clean overall? Are there problem areas or hot spots? Has there been any change to the drinking water quality?  Trend analysis allows BE to be proactive by identifying problems before they become too big. A graphical representation of the problem can help you to communicate the hazards. Trend analysis can help determine if engineering controls or process changes are effective at reducing overall exposures. Without tracking and trending data it is difficult to show that measures taken to reduce exposures are effective.  (Source:  4B051 CDC)  3.  What is a histogram?

Determine reason for trend analysis.1 2.  Enter the data into the OEL and sample data windows.2 2.  Determine lognormal 95th percentile.3 3.  Determine exposure profile and make recommendation.4    LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:     NOTES:  1.  Review the sampling strategy and methodology used to collect the data and conduct a preliminary data review. 2.  Calculations will be done using IHSTAT excel program.  This is done automatically by entering results into the “Sample Data” block of IHSTAT, shown below.                    AFQTP 4B071-17                                             Craftsman Training Guide:  Trend Analysis 3.  The 95th Percentile is automatically calculated under the Lognormal Parametric Statistics window.  4.  The 95th Percentile is then compared to the OEEL to make an exposure determination of Acceptable exposure, Unacceptable exposure, or Uncertain exposure.  The following classifications and actions are recommended:  95th Percentile less than 10% of the OEEL- Acceptable Exposure; verify every 5 years 95th Percentile between 10% and 50% of the OEEL- Acceptable Exposure; verify every 2 years 95th Percentile between 50% and 100% of the OEEL- Uncertain Exposure; collect more data and/or control the hazard 95th Percentile above 100% of the OEEL- Unacceptable Exposure; control the hazard              AFQTP 4B071-17                                          Craftsman Training Guide:  Trend Analysis TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS  STS Line Item 4.16.3:  Develop trend analyses from Occupational Health Data 1.

(Source:  4B051 CDC)  2.  List two areas that should be covered during a preliminary data review.   A:  1)  Check for sufficient sampling data (i.e., six or more sample results to characterize an exposure profile)  2)  Check for non-detectable results (i.e., results reported as less than the limit of detection) (Source:  4B051 CDC)   3.  Six sample results were entered for a process involving toluene.  The OEEL for Toluene is 20 ppm.  The 95th percentile was 12.5 ppm.  What is the exposure determination and recommendation?  A:  This exposure is Uncertain, 95th percentile greater than 50% of the OEEL (10 ppm) and less than 100% of the OEEL (20 ppm).  Therefore, you should collect more data and/or control the hazard.
