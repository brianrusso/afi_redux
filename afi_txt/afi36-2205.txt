Applying for an Age or Commissioned Service Waiver. Submit a request for a waiver in memoform with the appropriate letterhead and current address. (See AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official Com-munications) For Active-duty Age Waiver Requests:HQ USAF/DPPPR (Recommend sending by overnight mail)1040 Air Force Pentagon Washington DC 20330-1040 For ANG waiver requests, route through:State Adjutant General                                                              to: HQ ANG/DPFO Jefferson Plaza #1, 10th Floor 1411 Jefferson Davis Highway Arlington VA 22202-3231 If an ANG request is disapproved, it will be returned through HQ ANG/DPDF to the applicant’s stateheadquarters, which will forward to the applicant’s unit. For AFRC waiver requests, send to:HQ AFRC/DPMB 155 Richard Ray Blvd Robins AFB GA 31098-1635 Waivers. A2.1.1.  For waiver requests to be considered, applicants who exceed the age and/or TFCSD criteriamust document that an administrative, counseling, or medical error occurred within the last two yearsand prevented the applicant from applying for UFT when otherwise fully eligible. Further, command-ers must explicitly justify why supporting a waiver for an individual over fully qualified candidates isin the best interest of the Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve. Applicants who havealready had at least one opportunity to compete for UFT are generally not approved for a waiver. A2.1.2.  Administrative error: Committed by an Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserveagency or otherwise beyond the applicant’s control. Examples of administrative errors include: A2.1.2.1.  An application package was forwarded to the MPF to process, but the MPF failed toforward it, sent it to the wrong address, or did not properly screen the application package for therequired forms resulting in the package not meeting the UFT selection board. A2.1.2.2.  An incomplete or incorrect medical form. A2.1.3.  Counseling error: An Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve agency gaveincorrect information that the applicant could not verify. For example, a member was told that hecould not apply for UFT when he actually met all the eligibility criteria. A2.1.4.  Medical error: An incorrect diagnosis of a medical condition prevented the applicant fromapplying when otherwise eligible. For example, a member was diagnosed as having a disqualifying20AFI36-2205   29 OCTOBER 2004condition, but a review of the original diagnosis showed he was medically qualified. Attach the orig-inal medical form and the medical authority's supporting comments. A2.2.  Submit the request for an age and/or TFCSD waiver indorsed by the applicant’s immediate Squad-ron/CC, Group/CC, Wing/CC, NAF/CC, and MAJCOM/CC (or appropriate chain-of-command leadingto The Adjutant General (TAG) for ANG applicants), and forward to HQ USAF/DPPPR or HQ ANG/DPFO for staffing to the CSAF for final action. Include names, dates, and other details to clearly docu-ment the administrative, counseling, or medical error. Attach a complete copy of the UFT application andinclude a completed flying class I/IA physical with any approved medical waivers, certified by HQAETC/SGPS. A2.2.1.  All waiver requests are reviewed on an individual basis and, if approved, allow the applicanta one-time opportunity to compete for UFT. For active duty, if the requested age and/or TFCSDwaiver is not received in time for CSAF action before the UFT board convenes, the waiver packagewill be returned to the MAJCOM POC. If the waiver request is approved, HQ USAF/DPPPR will for-ward the package to HQ AFPC/DPAOT3 for inclusion on the board and notify the MAJCOM POC.However, if the application is disapproved, it will be returned to the MAJCOM POC. In either case,the MAJCOM POC will notify the applicant of the CSAF action through the chain of command. ForANG applications, USAF/DPPPR will forward approved and disapproved applications to ANG/DPDF for class scheduling or further disposition. In all cases, the individual applicant will be notifiedof the waiver decision via the chain-of-command. A2.2.2.  The CSAF may delegate the approval authority for age and commissioned service waiverrequests. A2.2.3.  The disapproval authority for an age or TFCSD waiver is vested in the Wing/CC (or equiva-lent). If the application is disapproved, it will be returned to the applicant. The disapproval authoritywithin the ANG chain-of-command for an age or TFCSD waiver is The Adjutant General. Any appli-cation disapproved by The Adjutant General will be returned to the applicant. Exceptions to Policy. A2.3.  If a member exceeds the age and/or TFCSD limits and does not meet the above criteria to be con-sidered for a waiver, he or she may request an exception to policy (ETP) through their MAJCOM or ANGchain of command as directed in A2.3. Age and TFCSD limits exist to protect the interests of the totalrated force and should not be taken lightly. Exceptions to policy will normally be granted only in rare cir-cumstances when a commander can document sustained, exceptional performance and the deviation frompolicy is minor. Further, commanders must specifically and explicitly justify why supporting an ETP foran individual, considering a large pool of fully qualified applicants, is in the best interests of the AirForce, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve. Each ETP imposes potential increased risk to opera-tional safety and effectiveness. Only the rare, truly exceptional individual should be endorsed and for-warded through the chain of command for ETP consideration. A2.3.1.  ETP requests judged by the Wing/CC (or equivalent) or TAG for Air National Guard, to haveinsufficient support or merit should be denied and returned to the applicant. AFI36-2205   29 OCTOBER 200421Attachment 3     SAMPLE, ADSC STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT If selected for UFT or ABM duties, I accept the appropriate ADSC as specified in AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC), dated 1 June 2000. ____________________________________________________ (signature and date) (printed or typed: first name, middle initial (MI), last name, SSN) Witnessed by MPF official: ____________________________________________________________________________________22AFI36-2205   29 OCTOBER 2004QUALIFYING DEGREE FIELDS FOR THE ASTRONAUT NOMINATION PROGRAM Attachment 4     This list is not intended to be a complete listing of qualifying degree fields for the Astronaut NominationProgram.

This change distinguishes between a waiver and an excep-tion to policy and clarifies the process for an Undergraduate Flying Training applicant to request a waiver or exception to policy to the age and Total Federal Commissioned Service limits. See the last attachment of the publication, IC 2004-1, for the complete IC. A bar (/) indicates revision from the previous edition. OPR: HQ AFPC/DPAOT3 (Mr. Howard M. Peterson) Supersedes: AFI 36-2205, 23 December 2003 Certified by: HQ AFPC/DPA (Col D. Lee Hall Jr.) 1.1.6. Active Duty applicants must not exceed their 30th birthday or 5 years beyond their Total Federal Commissioned Service Date (TFCSD) by the start date of the board’s first available UFT class as speci-fied in the UFT Selection Board Announcement message. See Attachment 2 for age or commissioned service waiver request procedures. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve applicants must not exceed their 30th birthday or 5 years beyond their TFCSD by their assigned UFT class start date (i.e., the UFT class start date may not be later than the date of the applicant’s 30th birthday). Attachment 2 AGE OR COMMISSIONED SERVICE WAIVER REQUEST A2.1. Applying for an Age or Commissioned Service Waiver. Submit a request for a waiver in memo form with the appropriate letterhead and current address.

For AFRC waiver requests, send to:HQ AFRC/DPMB 155 Richard Ray Blvd Robins AFB GA 31098-1635 32AFI36-2205   29 OCTOBER 2004Waivers. A2.2.. For waiver requests to be considered, applicants who exceed the age and/or TFCSD criteria must document that an administrative, counseling, or medical error occurred within the last two years and pre-vented the applicant from applying for UFT when otherwise fully eligible. Further, commanders must explicitly justify why supporting a waiver for an individual over fully qualified candidates is in the best interest of the Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve. Applicants who have already had at least one opportunity to compete for UFT are generally not approved for a waiver. A2.2.1. Administrative error: Committed by an Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve agency or otherwise beyond the applicant’s control. Examples of administrative errors include: A2.2.1.1. An application package was forwarded to the MPF to process, but the MPF failed to forward it, sent it to the wrong address, or did not properly screen the application package for the required forms resulting in the package not meeting the UFT selection board. A2.2.12.. An incomplete or incorrect medical form. A2.2.2. Counseling error: An Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve agency gave incorrect information that the applicant could not verify. For example, a member was told that he could not apply for UFT when he actually met all the eligibility criteria. A2.2.3. Medical error: An incorrect diagnosis of a medical condition prevented the applicant from apply-ing when otherwise eligible. For example, a member was diagnosed as having a disqualifying condition, but a review of the original diagnosis showed he was medically qualified. Attach the original medical form and the medical authority's supporting comments. A2.3. Submit the request for an age and/or TFCSD waiver indorsed by the applicant’s immediate Squad-ron/CC, Group/CC, Wing/CC, NAF/CC, and MAJCOM/CC (or appropriate chain-of-command leading to The Adjutant General (TAG) for ANG applicants), and forward to HQ USAF/DPPPR or HQ ANG/DPFO for staffing to the CSAF for final action. Include names, dates, and other details to clearly docu-ment the administrative, counseling, or medical error. Attach a complete copy of the UFT application and include a completed flying class I/IA physical with any approved medical waivers, certified by HQ AETC/SGPS. A2.3.1. All waiver requests are reviewed on an individual basis and, if approved, allow the applicant a one-time opportunity to compete for UFT. For active duty, if the requested age and/or TFCSD waiver is not received in time for CSAF action before the UFT board convenes, the waiver package will be returned to the MAJCOM POC. If the waiver request is approved, HQ USAF/DPPPR will forward the package to HQ AFPC/DPAOT3 for inclusion on the board and notify the MAJCOM POC. However, if the applica-tion is disapproved, it will be returned to the MAJCOM POC. In either case, the MAJCOM POC will notify the applicant of the CSAF action through the chain of command. For ANG applications, USAF/DPPPR will forward approved and disapproved applications to ANG/DPDF for class scheduling or fur-ther disposition. In all cases, the individual applicant will be notified of the waiver decision via the chain-of-command. A2.3.2. The CSAF may delegate the approval authority for age and commissioned service waiver requests. A2.3.3. The disapproval authority for an age or TFCSD waiver is vested in the Wing/CC (or equivalent). If the application is disapproved, it will be returned to the applicant. The disapproval authority within the AFI36-2205   29 OCTOBER 200433ANG chain-of-command for an age or TFCSD waiver is The Adjutant General. Any application disap-proved by The Adjutant General will be returned to the applicant. Exceptions to Policy. A2.4. If a member exceeds the age and/or TFCSD limits and does not meet the above criteria to be con-sidered for a waiver, he or she may request an exception to policy (ETP) through their MAJCOM or ANG chain of command as directed in A2.3. Age and TFCSD limits exist to protect the interests of the total rated force and should not be taken lightly. Exceptions to policy will normally be granted only in rare cir-cumstances when a commander can document sustained, exceptional performance and the deviation from policy is minor. Further, commanders must specifically and explicitly justify why supporting an ETP for an individual, considering a large pool of fully qualified applicants, is in the best interests of the Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve. Each ETP imposes potential increased risk to opera-tional safety and effectiveness. Only the rare, truly exceptional individual should be endorsed and for-warded through the chain of command for ETP consideration.
