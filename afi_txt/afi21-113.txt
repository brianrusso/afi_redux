The  program provides  for  maintenance  and  calibration  of  TMDE  to  verify  the  reliability  and  ensure  the accuracy of systems, subsystems, and equipment. Air Force Primary Standards Laboratory (AFPSL)—The highest level calibration standards laboratory in the AFMETCAL Program.  It maintains AF measurement standards certified by the NIST or other nationally recognized standards.  The AFPSL (located at Heath, Ohio) uses these measurement standards to calibrate base level or PMEL measurement standards and equipment for AF customers. Alignment—The physical, electrical, or software action that enables a calibration technician to adjust TMDE so that performance will be within required operational parameters/accuracies. Calibration—A comparison between equipment items, one of which is a measurement standard of  known  accuracy,  to  detect,  correlate,  adjust  and  report  any  variations  in  the  accuracy  of  the other item. Calibration  and  Measurement  Requirement  Summary  (CMRS)—A  three-category,  inline summary of measurement parameters.  A CMRS identifies all measurement requirements within a  specific  system  or  item  of  equipment.    The  CMRS  further  displays  the  contractors'  proposed solutions  for  maintaining  the  system  measurement  requirements  within  the  stated  limits.    It  is also used to identify the need for new calibration standards. AFI21-113  3 JUNE 2016 15 Calibration  and  Measurement  Summary  (CMS)—A  technical  order  which  identifies calibration  support  necessary  to  ensure  the  operational  readiness  of  a  specific  weapon  system, subsystem  or  mission.    The  summary  describes  the  calibration  concept  and  is  the  calibration authority for the applicable weapon system, weapon subsystem or mission. Certification—The documented designation that standards and TMDE have been calibrated and meet established technical requirements.  When used to refer to a calibration laboratory (PMEL or AFPSL), certification means the laboratory fulfills AFMETCAL assessment criteria. MAJCOM  (or  equivalent)—This term refers to  all Air Force Major Commands (MAJCOMs) and  includes  the  Air  National  Guard  (ANG),  Field  Operating  Agencies  (FOAs),  and  Direct Reporting Units (DRUs). Metrology—The science or system of weights and measures used to determine conformance to technical requirements.  This includes the development of standards and systems for absolute and relative measurements. MetWeb—MetWeb  provides  dynamic  data  applications  for  use  by  the  AF  Metrology community.  This  primarily  includes  personnel  assigned  to  Precision  Measurement  Equipment Laboratories (PMEL) and their MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM). Precision  Measurement  Equipment  Laboratory  (PMEL)—A  laboratory  authorized  to  own and use AF base measurement standards to maintain working standards.  The working standards are used along with PMEL-owned TMDE to maintain (troubleshoot, align, repair, and calibrate) TMDE designated as PMEL responsibility. Support  Equipment  Recommendation  Data  (SERD)—A  contractual  data  item  submitted  by the contractor to identify weapon system support equipment requirements. Test,  Measurement,  and  Diagnostic  Equipment  (TMDE)—Those  devices  used  to  maintain, evaluate,  measure,  calibrate,  test,  inspect,  diagnose,  or  otherwise  examine  materials,  supplies, equipment, and systems to identify or isolate actual or potential malfunctions, or decide if they meet operational specifications established in technical documents. Traceability—The  ability  to  relate  individual  measurement  results  to  national  standards  or nationally accepted measurement systems through an unbroken chain of comparisons all having stated uncertainties. Types  of  Standards  Used  in  Measurement  and  Testing—The  term  "standard"  means equipment  or  physical  constants  serving  as  the  basic  means  by  which  we  derive  accurate  and traceable precision measurements.  These standards include: a. National Measurement Standards—Equipment or physical constants identified by NIST to serve as a basic measurement reference throughout the United States. b. Air Force Measurement Standards—Equipment certified by NIST or AFMETCAL-approved sources, and used by the AFPSL as a basic measurement reference for the USAF. c. Air Force Base Measurement Standards—Equipment certified by the AFPSL or AFMETCAL-approved sources for use by an AF PMEL as a measurement reference. d. Calibration Systems-A collection of calibration standards and ancillary equipment uniquely configured to support a specific workload or multiple measurement parameters.          (Calibration Systems may be developed for use in either an automated or manual mode.  16 AFI21-113  3 JUNE 2016 AFMETCAL retains engineering and configuration authority for Calibration Systems identified with an AFMETCAL cage code.) e. Working Standards—PMEL-certified TMDE used to calibrate other TMDE.
