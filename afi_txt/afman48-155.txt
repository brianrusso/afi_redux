SUMMARY OF CHANGES This is the initial publication of AFMAN 48-155, Occupational and Environmental Health Exposure Controls. AFMAN48-155   1 OCTOBER 2008  3  Chapter 1  Occupational and Environmental Health Exposure Control  1.1.  Overview.    1.1.1. Effectively anticipating, identifying and assessing Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH) threats enables the identification and implementation of controls necessary to eliminate or mitigate threats from hazardous OEH exposures.  When determining OEH threat control options, it is imperative to follow the OEH health risk assessment guidelines outlined in AFMANs 48-153, Health Risk Assessment and 48-154, Occupational and Environmental Health Site Assessment.  Figure 1.1 outlines the Health Risk Assessment (HRA) and Health Risk Management (HRM) relationship.  This manual focuses on the control portion of HRA/HRM (highlighted in Figure 1.1).  1.1.2. A health threat, as defined in AFMAN 48-153, is a potential or actual condition that can cause short or long-term injury, illness, or death to personnel. Routine and special assessments are conducted in accordance with AFI 48-145, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Health Program, to identify and assess OEH threats.  1.1.3. A health risk is the combination of an identified health threat and the vulnerability of exposure route completion to the population at risk.  Health risks associated with chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and physical threat exposure(s) may be long-term (chronic) or short-term (acute) and may be reversible or irreversible.  Identifying the extent to which individual factors contribute to an OEH threat exposure is critical in the determination of exposure controls. The primary factors that can affect the intensity of an OEH exposure are:    1.1.3.1. Threat source (e.g. hazardous material used in an industrial process, emissions from an open burn pit, etc.)  1.1.3.2. Route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, absorption, contact, whole body exposure)  1.1.3.3. Work patterns/practices 1.1.3.4. Concentration 1.1.3.5. Frequency and duration of exposure  1.2. Standards and Exposure Limits.  1.2.1. Occupational and Environmental Exposure Limits (OEEL) are established to protect personnel from OEH threat exposure(s).  They apply to occupational and environmental exposures for individuals and/or similar exposure groups (SEG) in a particular Area of Concern (AOC).  Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) can use OEELs to evaluate the effectiveness of established controls and make recommendations to the affected commander on the acceptability of risk from OEH hazard exposures.        4  AFMAN48-155   1 OCTOBER 2008 Figure 1.1  Health Risk Assessment and Management Relationship  Health Risk Assessment Locate Source Determine Exposure  Pathway              Identify Health Threat / Risk   Population At Risk Define  Assess Vulnerability Estimate Risk / Level (Evaluate Hazard) Threat / Risk Analysis Health Risk Management Identify Controls / Countermeasure slortnoC tnemelpmI ssenevitceffE ssessA / weiveRDevelop Course of Action Operational Context 1.2.2. BE determines the OEEL using Air Force standards (AFIs, AFOSH standards, etc.) or the most appropriate exposure limit adopted from established, recognized standards including but not limited to the latest edition of Industrial Ventilation A Manual of Recommended Practice and Threshold Limit Values (TLVs)® and Biological Exposure Indices (BEIs)®, published respectively by the American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH); 29 CFR 1910, Occupational Safety and Health Standards; Emergency Response Planning Guidelines (ERPG) & Workplace Environmental Exposure Levels (WEEL) Handbook, published by the American Industrial Hygiene Association; 40 CFR 141, National Primary Drinking Water Regulations; Technical Guide 230 (TG-230), Chemical Exposure Guidelines for Deployed Military Personnel, published by the US Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM), as well as technical reports or guidance documents provided by the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM).  In the absence of recognized standards, BE should contact USAFSAM/OE for guidance on exposure limits for potential OEH threats.  However, the determination of an unacceptable level of exposure to a potential OEH threat and, subsequently, the need for controls will require local BE staff to work with the affected unit commander to effectively apply Operational Risk Management (ORM) principles outlined in AFPD 90-9, Operational Risk Management and AFI 90-901, Operational Risk Management, as well as professional judgment.     AFMAN48-155   1 OCTOBER 2008  5 Chapter 2  Occupational and Environmental Health Threat Controls  2.1 Controls. OEH controls are any one or a combination of engineering, administrative or personal protective equipment control(s) implemented to eliminate or minimize an OEH threat.  OEH threat control options should be considered according to the following priority:  1) engineering, 2) administrative, 3) personal protective equipment (PPE) as shown in Figure 2.1.  The implementation of engineering controls should always be considered first.  If engineering controls are not feasible or are not completely effective in controlling the OEH threat exposure, administrative controls and/or personal protective equipment (PPE) will be used.  The mission or unique situations may dictate the need for adjustments to this priority in order to adequately control the health hazard and/or protect health.   Figure  2.1  Priority of OEH Threat Control Selection      2.1.1. Engineering Controls.   Administrative Controls Engineering Controls PPE  2.1.1.1. These controls (e.g. local exhaust ventilation, noise barriers, etc.)  are used to isolate, enclose, reduce, attenuate or remove health threats from a SEG. Engineering controls focus on the various sources of threats and should be incorporated during initial design process.  However, design changes to existing systems, elimination of processes and/or substitution of less hazardous materials may be required to ensure personnel are provided a workplace free of recognized health threats.    2.1.1.2. In some situations, engineering controls such as ventilation systems may be required to control fire or explosive hazards.  These hazards may present additional risks other than the occupational or environmental health hazards, and the fire department and safety office should be consulted when these risks may be present.   2.1.2. Administrative Controls.    2.1.2.1. Administrative controls are any procedures or particular set of actions undertaken in order to significantly limit OEH threat exposure.  These controls include measures to reduce exposure frequency/duration for a SEG and development of procedures directed at controlling exposures to a health threat (e.g. wetting down a surface to reduce the release of particulate matter).  Administrative controls can also include instituting restrictions or directives necessary to prevent health threat exposures (e.g. directing base housing occupants to boil water due to water contamination).    6  AFMAN48-155   1 OCTOBER 2008 2.1.2.2. When changing work practices or locations are not feasible or effective solutions to reducing threats, rotating work schedules and/or exposure time limitations can be established to maintain exposures below established OEELs.  However, personnel rotation shall not be used to control exposures for human carcinogens or when prohibited by a specific federal, state or Air Force standard.    2.1.3. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).    2.1.3.1. PPE creates a physical barrier between personnel and the OEH threat (e.g. respiratory protection, hearing protection, and protective clothing).  It prevents the OEH threat from completing its exposure route.  Identification of the threat, potential routes of exposure, and the effectiveness of a specific protective material in providing a barrier to the threat are the key factors in the PPE selection process.  2.1.3.2. The amount of protection provided by PPE is specific to the protective equipment and threat.  For example, protective equipment materials, i.e., rubber gloves, that protect well against some hazardous substances may protect poorly, or not at all, against others. In order to provide effective protection from identified threats, ensure the protective capabilities of the PPE, in relation to the specific health threat, are considered in the selection process.    2.2. Control Determination.    2.2.1. BE will determine and recommend which controls (engineering, administrative, and/or PPE) are appropriate to reduce hazardous exposures to acceptable levels.  Commanders will decide whether or not to implement recommended controls based on mission requirements.  The following paragraphs and tables illustrate examples of control determination.  Note the examples are very similar to those used in AFMAN 48-154, Occupational and Environmental Health Site Assessment.  These examples were chosen deliberately to help connect this document with companion documents.    2.2.2. Husky AFB (Figure 2.2) represents a typical home station setting.  It illustrates Areas of Concern such as base housing, the community center, etc.  Examples of potential health threat sources are identified in bold italics.  SEGs, threats, potential exposure pathways and possible control options are listed in Table 2.1.  2.2.3.  Camp Falcon (Figure 2.3) represents a deployed station setting.  Examples of potential health threats sources are identified in bold italics.  SEGs, threats, potential exposure pathways and control options are listed in Table 2.2.    AFMAN48-155   1 OCTOBER 2008  7 Figure 2.2 Husky AFB Site Assessment Model  ff-base)       Base  Housing (O         Off Base     Table 2.1  SEG Air Emissions Wing HQ Buildings Incinerator 1 2 3 4 Hazardous Noise Contaminated Soil Radiation Radar Tower Air Emissions Contaminated Soil Air Emissions Reservoir Air Emissions Vehicle  Maintenance Corrosion Control 1 2 3 4 Community Center Industry Base  Housing Husky AFB Husky AFB Site Assessment and Control Determination Data Threat (Source) Pathway Incinerator Workers Toxic Industrial Material(s) Combustion  By-products (Incinerator) Air (Inhalation) Base Housing Occupants  (Off) Combustion By-products (Incinerator) Air (Inhalation) Base Populace Toxic Industrial Material (Terrorist Event at Local Industry) Air (Inhalation)   Control Engineering (Air Cleaning Device at Source, Local Exhaust and General Ventilation) Administrative (Rotating Shifts, Waste Segregation coupled with Burn Efficiency Optimization) PPE (Respiratory Protection) Engineering (Air Cleaning Device at Source)  Administrative (Waste Segregation coupled with Burn Efficiency Optimization)  Administrative (Evacuation/ Shelter in Place) PPE (Respiratory Protection & Protective Clothing)   AFMAN48-155   1 OCTOBER 2008 Husky AFB Site Assessment and Control Determination Data (cont’d) Threat (Source) Noise (Aircraft) Pathway Air (Whole Body, Ear) Non-ionizing Radiation (Radar) Air (Whole Body) Toxic Industrial Materials (Sanding) Air(Inhalation/Contact) Toxic Industrial Materials or Microorganism (Contaminated Water)  Public Water System (Ingestion) Control Engineering (Shielding/Barrier) Administrative (Increase Distance of Radar from Personnel, Reposition Radar)  Engineering (Orbital Sander in Combination with Exhaust Ventilation) Administrative (Routine Workplace Clean-up with HEPA Vacuum) PPE (Respiratory Protection/ Protective Clothing) Engineering (Water Treatment) Administrative (Boil Water, Bottled Water, System Flush/Loop Isolation) 8  Table 2.1  SEG Wing HQ Personnel Wing HQ Personnel Corrosion Control Workers  Figure 2.3           Base Populace  Camp Falcon Site Assessment Model Tent City1 Hazardous Noise Air Emissions Industry Radiation Radar Reservoir Contaminated Soil Air Emissions Burn Pit  Water Contamination Off Base Former Barrel Dump Site     1 Location of Tent City and proximity to potential health threats should be considered during OEH Site Assessment and prior to base bed-down  Camp Falcon AFMAN48-155   1 OCTOBER 2008  9 Table 2.2  Camp Falcon Site Assessment and Control Determination Data  SEG Occupants of Tent City Threat (Source) Toxic Industrial Material (Local Industry) Pathway Air (Inhalation)  Engineering (Air Cleaning Device Control Toxic Industrial Material (Burn Pit) Occupants of Tent City/ Burn Pit Personnel Air (Inhalation)  Engineering (Construct Incinerator Population at Camp Falcon Particulate Matter Air (Inhalation)  Engineering (Barriers/Shielding) at Source)  Administrative (Relocate Tent City)1with Air Cleaning Device) Administrative (Relocate Burn Pit, Segregate Wastes with Toxic Combusted By-products, Coordinate Burn Pit Operations with Weather Accounting for Wind Direction, Temperature Inversion, etc.) PPE (Respiratory Protection for Burn Pit Personnel) Engineering (Shielding/Barrier) Administrative (Relocate Tent City) PPE (Hearing Protection) Administrative (Increase Distance of Radar from Personnel, Reposition Radar)  Engineering (Remediate Soil, Construct Barrier to Contain Site) Administrative (Restrict Access to Site) PPE (Protective Clothing)  Administrative (Move Personnel Indoors) PPE (Respiratory Protection) Engineering (Water Treatment) Administrative (Bottled Water, Boil Water)  Occupants of Tent City Noise (Aircraft) Air (Ear, Whole Body) Occupants of Tent City Non-ionizing Radiation (Radar) Air (Whole Body) Occupants of Tent City Toxic Industrial Material (Barrel Dump) Contaminated Soil (Contact) Population at Camp Falcon Unknown Agent (Contaminated Water) Potable Water Source (Ingestion)                                                    10  AFMAN48-155   1 OCTOBER 2008 2.2.4. The basic method for determining OEH controls is the same regardless of the situation or the type of OEH threat.  The primary difference in the control determination process relates to the amount of time available to make a decision regarding which control(s) to implement.  An extended period of time, e.g., several weeks, may be available to determine an optimum control for a health threat related to an industrial process.  Whereas, controls for immediate threats such as those posed by incidents involving the release of hazardous materials or drinking water contamination may require a nearly immediate decision in order to protect human health.  Attachment 2 provides examples that illustrate the control determination process for two distinct situations.  2.2.5. The critical step in determining which control to implement is identifying the potential effectiveness of a control relative to a particular OEH threat.  USACHPPM TG 230 states that a control’s effectiveness can be assessed by applying the following three parameters:  1) the control must be able to mitigate the OEH threat exposure to an acceptable level, 2) the responsible organization must be able to reasonably implement the control option, and 3) the control must be practical when considering cost and time associated with implementation.    2.2.6. The control determination process is dynamic.  Once a control(s) has been selected, its effectiveness must be routinely evaluated.  Processes and the respective OEH threats associated with them may change.  The frequency of evaluating a control should be based on several factors to include but not limited to:  risk to personnel if performance of control degrades or fails, reliability and historical performance of control and operators, and toxicity of material.  Additionally, new control options may become available that provide better protection (e.g. improved ventilation system, noise source isolation, etc.).  BE must continue to aggressively pursue improved control options in order to optimize force health protection for personnel.  Utilization of Risk Assessment Codes and forums such as the Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health Council provide opportunities for BE to identify the advantages of new control options to installation leadership.    2.2.7.

The Action Level for airborne exposures is typically one-half the Occupational & Environmental Exposure Limit for time-weighted average (TWA) exposures, except where 29 CFR 1910 Subpart Z designates a different concentration or where the statistical variability of sample results indicates that a lower fraction of the OEL should be used as the Action Level. Carcinogens - Hazardous materials that stimulate the formation of cancer. It is AF policy to reduce exposure to confirmed human carcinogens as low as practicable.  For the purpose of Hazard Communication compliance, confirmed and suspected human carcinogens are treated as carcinogens. A mixture is considered to be a carcinogen if it contains a carcinogenic component with a concentration of 0.1 percent or greater. AFMAN48-155   1 OCTOBER 2008  13 Exposure - The concentration, frequency, and duration to which personnel are subject to a hazardous material. Exposure Route - The pathway (inhalation, ingestion, contact, absorption, whole body exposure) by which hazardous material comes into contact with personnel. Occupational & Environmental Exposure Limit (OEEL) - The OEEL is the most appropriate limit adopted from established recognized standards including, but not limited to, those in AFIs and AFOSH Standards, the latest edition of the TLV® Booklet published annually by the American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists, 29 CFR 1910.1000 Tables Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 and 40 CFR 141.  OEELs are limits of exposure established to protect personnel from hazardous OEH threat exposures.  OEELs apply to OEH threat exposures for individuals and/or similarly exposed groups of individuals.  Process - Any item of work or situation that may pose a risk, and may require evaluation and control; the lowest level of work that may require evaluation to assess exposure and associated controls.  Not all processes are associated with a physical location, e.g., working near the flight line may constitute a process.  The terms Activity and Process are synonymous.   Similar Exposure Group (SEG) - A group of individuals for whom representative exposure for any member of the group is predictive of exposures of all members of the group.  The term “SEG” is formally defined in the AIHA publication, “A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures.” Time Weighted Average (TWA) - An average exposure over a defined time period; also referred to as time weighted average concentration.  Workplace - An environment where potential OEH exposures may occur.  A workplace may be administrative, industrial, or all encompassing, e.g., any setting where an OEH exposure may occur while deployed.   14  AFMAN48-155   1 OCTOBER 2008 - If this is effective at maintaining exposures below the OEEL and the action level, then BE must continue to perform routine monitoring to ensure control remains effective. - If this is not effective or if exposures remain above the action level, then consider implementing administrative controls in addition to the engineering control. Scenario 1:  Corrosion Control Facility Operations  Corrosion  control  activities  present  multiple  health  threats  associated  with  de-painting (sanding,  abrasive  blasting,  etc.)  and  painting  processes.    After  BE  identifies  and  evaluates OEH  threats  in  the  SEG  using  the  HRA  process  outlined  in  AFMAN  48-153,  Health  Risk Assessment, exposure control recommendations are made.   OEH Exposure Assessment:   Based on air sampling, exposure levels are above the OEEL for hexavalent chromium during a sanding operation. Engineering Control: Implement local exhaust ventilation in combination with orbital sanding units to reduce exposures. Attachment 2  Occupational and Environmental Health Threat Control Determination Scenarios                                - If this is effective, then BE must continue to perform routine monitoring to ensure control remains effective as well as investigate the possibility of implementing engineering and administrative controls in the future. - If this is not effective, then an operational risk management decision needs to be made regarding whether or not to continue operations. Issues to consider: - What is the mission impact due to ceasing operations? - Can the ventilation system be modified to meet necessary specifications? - Can the workload be sent to another base/contract facility that can properly control exposures? - Is the risk to unprotected personnel acceptable in order meet mission requirements? Administrative Control: Implement new work practices (e.g. utilize a HEPA vacuum to clean the workplace) in order to reduce exposures to acceptable levels. - If this is effective, then BE must continue to perform routine monitoring to ensure control remains effective and investigate the use of engineering controls in the future. - If this is not effective, then consider using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in  addition to the previous controls.  PPE: Implement respirator usage in addition to coveralls, gloves, etc. to reduce exposures to acceptable levels.  AFMAN48-155   1 OCTOBER 2008  15 Scenario 2:  Terrorist Attack Using Tanker Truck  Terrorists commandeer a truck carrying pesticide.  The truck is driven up to the main gate of Camp  Falcon  and  an  explosive  charge  releases  the  pesticide.    A  plume  ensues  and  begins migrating across Camp Falcon.  After the initial first responders arrive on scene, BE is asked to respond.  Air sampling indicates that the truck was carrying an organophosphate pesticide.  All base personnel are carrying a full complement of individual protective equipment (IPE). OEH Exposure Assessment:   Personnel are experiencing shortness of breath, headaches and nausea. What are the control options for this scenario? Engineering Control: Engineering controls are not available or applicable for immediate mitigation of the health threat in this situation. Administrative Control: Evacuate all personnel in the hazard area upwind or crosswind from the chemical plume. - If this is effective, then personnel should be monitored for latent effects from exposure. - If it is not effective, consider a shelter-in-place option and personal protective equipment for those that cannot shelter. PPE: Direct personnel to wear IPE.  Does this step effectively mitigate the threat in order for mission essential work to continue in contaminated areas?  - If yes, then BE must continue to perform monitoring to ensure control remains effective until the threat is eliminated or dissipates from the AOC. - If no, then an operational risk management decision needs to be made regarding whether or not to continue operations in contaminated areas. Issues to consider: - What is the mission impact due to ceasing operations? - Can operations be relocated until the threat dissipates in order to meet mission requirements? - Is the risk to personnel acceptable in order meet mission requirements? - How quickly/effectively can a shelter-in-place or evacuation plan be executed as the plume     migrates?
