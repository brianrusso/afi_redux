The Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the Fleet Management & Analysis specialty.  The CFETP provides Fleet Management & Analysis  personnel a clear career path to success and instills rigor in all aspects of career field training. Note:  Civilians occupying  associated positions may use Part  II to support duty position qualification training.  Air Force  Reserve Command  (AFRC)  and  Air  National  Guard  (ANG) career  paths  will  differ from  the  career paths  depicted  in  this  document. They may develop career paths  that  more accurately describe the life-cycle of reserve and guard personnel. 2. The CFETP  consists of  two  parts;  both  parts  of  the  plan  are used  by supervisors  to  plan, manage and control training within the career field. 2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains  how everyone  will  use the  plan;  Section  B  identifies  career field  progression information, duties and responsibilities, training  strategies and career field path; Section  C associates  each  level  with  specialty qualifications  (knowledge,  education,  training  and  other);  Section D indicates resource constraints (some examples are funds, manpower, equipment and facilities); Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. 2.2. Part  II includes the following: Section A identifies the STSs and includes duties, tasks, technical  references  to  support training,  Air Education  and  Training Command  (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, core task and correspondence course requirements; Section  B Optional (not used); Section C identifies available support materials (an example is a  Qualification Training Package (QTP) which may be developed to support proficiency training  and they are identified in http://www.e-publishing.af.mil; Section D identifies a training course   index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training (included here are both mandatory  and  optional  courses);  Section  E  identifies  (Major  Commands)  MAJCOM’s  unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs. 3. Using  guidance  provided  in  the  CFETP  will  ensure  individuals  in  vehicle  management specialties receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career.  This plan will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs. At unit-level, supervisors and trainers  will  use  Part  II  to  identify,  plan  and  conduct  training commensurate  with  the overall goals of this plan. 4 ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS).

Purpose.  The CFETP  provides  information  necessary for  AFCFM,  MFMs,  commanders, training  managers,  supervisors  and  trainers to plan,  develop,  manage and  conduct  effective career  field  training programs. This  plan  outlines  the  training that  individuals  in  these AFSs should  receive  in order  to  develop  and  progress  throughout  their  career.  This  plan  identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training. AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at  one of the technical training centers.  UGT identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7- and 9- skill levels.  QT is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the UGT process.  It is designed  to  provide  the  performance  skills/knowledge  required  to  do  the  job.  Advanced training   is formal specialty training used for selected Airmen. Proficiency training is additional training,  either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses or OJT, provided to personnel to   increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes, some are: 1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct and evaluate a career field training program. Also,  it  is  used  to  help  supervisors  identify training  at  the  appropriate  point  in  an individual's career. 1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career. 1.3. Lists  training  courses  available  in  the  specialty,  identifies  sources  of  training  and  the training delivery method. 1.4. Identifies major resource constraints which impact full implementation of the desired career field training process. 2. Uses. The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive  and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty. (3) NOTE: The  Air Force  District  of Washington  (AFDW) serves  as  the  MFM  for personnel  assigned  to  Air Force Elements (AFELM). 2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 9     2.2. MFMs  will  ensure  their  training  programs  complement  the  CFETP  mandatory  initial, upgrade and proficiency requirements.  Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training, contract training or exportable courses. 2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 3. Coordination  and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority. MAJCOM  representatives and  AETC  training  personnel  will  identify and  coordinate  on  the  career  field training requirements. The AETC training manager for 2T3XX specialties will initiate an annual review of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy. Using the list of  courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training. SECTION B: CAREER PROGRESSION AND INFORMATION 4. Specialty Descriptions.

Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level play an important role in the Air Force's ability to accomplish its mission.  It is essential that everyone involved in training must do their part to plan, manage and conduct an effective training program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate  points in their career.  The following narrative  and AFSC 2T3X7 Career Development Flow Charts identify career skill progression. 5.1. Apprentice (3-skill level): Upon completion of initial skills training, trainees work with a trainer  to  enhance  their  knowledge  and  skills. Individuals  will  use  a  combination  OJT and advanced courses to progress in the career field.  Education toward a CCAF degree should continue. The goal for 5-skill level upgrade training is  24 months but must have a minimum of 12 months of OJT. 5.2. Journeyman  (5-skill  level): Once  upgraded  to  the  5-level,  journeymen  will  enter  into continuation training to broaden their experience base. Typical job positions for 5-levels include positions requiring supervisory skills such as OJT trainer, quality assurance inspector and  materiel control or section supervisor. 5-levels will complete required available advanced courses, and MAJCOM specific training. Individuals will attend the Airman Leadership School (ALS) after completing 48  months  in  the Air Force,  or upon  selection  for promotion  to Staff  Sergeant. Individuals  will  use  appropriate  reference materials  to  prepare  for testing under the Weighted Airman’s Promotions System (WAPS).  Education toward a CCAF  degree  should  continue. 5.3. Craftsman (7-skill level): Craftsmen can expect to fill various supervisory and management positions and may be assigned to higher headquarters staff positions and 2T3X7 formal schools. Personnel are encouraged to take courses to obtain added knowledge on management of resources  and personnel. Continue academic education through CCAF and higher degree programs. In addition, eligible individuals will complete Enlisted PME developmental courses. 5.4. Superintendent (9-skill level): A 9-level is expected to fill leadership,  supervisory and management positions such as vehicle fleet manager or vehicle management superintendent, and may  be  assigned  to  headquarters  staff  positions. Additional  training  in  the  areas  of  budget, manpower,  resource, and personnel management is necessary, and can be  provided through continuing  education. The  9-skill  level  is  awarded  upon  sew-on  of  Senior  Master  Sergeant. Additional higher education and completion of courses outside the career AFSC are also recommended. 6. Training  Decisions. The CFETP  uses  a building block  approach  (simple  to  complex)  to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the vehicle management career field. The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where and how to meet the training requirements. Strategy  must  be  apparent  and  affordable  to  reduce  duplication  of  training  and  eliminate  a disjointed approach to training.  The Utilization & Training Workshop (U&TW) determines what, when and how training material is taught. 6.1. Initial  Skills  Training.  The  initial  skills  courses  were  revised  to  provide  the  training needed to better prepare graduates for the tasks they will be facing in the field. 6.2. Upgrade Training. Completion of required core tasks is required for personnel progressing to AFSC 2T357. 7. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon  completion of basic military training. CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate in  Applied Sciences Degree. In  addition to its associate’s degree  program, CCAF  offers  the  following: 7.1. CCAF Instructor Certification. Upon completion of instructor qualification training, consisting of the instructor methods course and supervised practice teaching, CCAF instructors who  13 possess an associate degree or higher may be nominated by their school commander and commandant for the CCAF Instructor Certification. 7.2. Trade  Skill Certification. When a  CCAF  student separates or retires, a  trade  skill certification is awarded for the primary occupational specialty.  The college uses a competency based  assessment process  for trade skill  certification  at  one of four proficiency levels: Apprentice, journeyman, craftsman/supervisor or master craftsman/manager. All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript. 7.3. Applicability.  The  Maintenance  Production  Management  program  applies  to occupational specialties:  2T3X7. 7.3.1.  Degree Requirements.  All Airmen are automatically entered into the CCAF program.

The AU ABC initiative establishes a partnership between the Air Force and accredited civilian higher education institutions to offer baccalaureate degree opportunities via distance learning.  AU ABC links Airmen who have completed Associate Degrees to military friendly baccalaureate programs.  AU ABC applies CCAF Associate Degree credit towards baccalaureate degrees and requires participants to complete no more than 60 semester hours after having earned an Associate in Applied Science degree. 7.4. Vehicle Management Career Path.   Establishing a viable and sustainable career path for our Airmen requires a deliberate approach and one focusing on opportunities across the spectrum of Fleet Management & Analysis operations where all Airmen have the ability to gain practical experience.  Moreover, the path  prescribes varying levels of Fleet Management & Analysis professional education as well as developmental education,  targeting specific points in an Airman’s career.  Defining developmental goals ensures we align job  experience and educational opportunities to support the development of our force.  The goals are  outlined as follows: 7.4.1. Meet the Joint and Combatant Commander’s Needs.  The goal ensures we maintain our warfighting capability at the forefront of our training and development.  We need to have folks postured in the right positions with the right experience and education to meet the Joint and Combatant Commander’s requirements. 7.4.2. Deliberately Develop Airmen.  This goal leverages specific training and experience in order to prepare our Airmen for future assignments.  It recognizes previous duties and responsibilities and allows leaders to provide further opportunities for developing Airmen using education, duties, and assignments. 7.4.3. Forecast Force Development Requirements.  Education and training is a costly endeavor and to ensure courses are available to meet the needs of our community, we must forecast and budget for the right courses.  This provides a sustainable approach to Fleet Management & Analysis force development. 7.4.4. Enlisted Development Board.  Provide guidance and feedback through the Vehicle Management Enlisted Development Board to help vector individuals into critical positions and develop the leaders of tomorrow. 7.4.5. Ensure Members Understand Their Value.

This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC applies to all classes entering after 3 October 2016; CDC customer need date is 1 April 2017. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI36-2201, this STS: Lists the mandatory and general tasks, knowledge and TRs necessary for Airmen to perform duties  at the 3-, 5- and 7-skill levels in the AFSC 2T3X7 ladder of the Airman VehicleManagement Career  Field. Becomes an AFJQS for OJT when placed in an OJT record and used according to AFI  36-2201. Provides OJT certification columns in Part 2, Section A to record completion of task  and knowledge training requirements. Shows formal training requirements.   The 3-level course columns show the proficiencyto be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training in skill-level ascension course. It is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the WAPS. SKTs are developed at the  USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog.  Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion/Demotion Programs. WAPS is only applicable to active duty personnel. Qualitative Requirements. Part 2, Section A contains the proficiency code key used to indicate  the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses. Documentation. Supervisors, trainers and trainees must ensure all training documentation  contained within an Airman’s Individual Training Plan (ITP) in TBA IAW AFI 36-2201 and the current TBA Application User’s Guide. The 2T3X7 AFCFM has not identified any core tasks requiring third-party certification.  However, MAJCOMs may establish policy concerning third-party certification. Note: Required up-grade training “core task(s)” identified by local unit, as “not available for training” must be  annotated in TBA. The 5- or 7-level skill can then be awarded when all other training and core tasks are complete. Converting External Task into TBA (Transcription Procedures). This action allows  Supervisors to convert tasks from an external source (AF Form623) into TBA. When this action is  initiated, the tasks that are converted into TBA go into the Airman’s archived task lists. At that point, the supervisor with authority over the Airman’s record can then select which tasks should be  unarchived and moved to an active status IAW the TBA Application User’s Guide. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available:  The supervisor identifies training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, as a minimum, that  the trainee covers the mandatoryitems in the AFECD. 22   Decertification and Recertification of ITP Task. When an Airman is found to be unqualified  on an ITP task previously completed for their duty position in TBA, the supervisor will take action to  decertify the task and complete Journal Entry IAW the TBA Application User’s Guide, Decertify IPT  Task instructions. TrainingStandard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the go/no go level.  Go  means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands  for accuracy, timeliness and correct use of procedures IAW AFI 36-2201. Recommendations.  Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates to 344 TRS/TRRP, 1015 Femoyer Street, Lackland AFB TX 78236-5404.  Report inadequacies of  this STS through command channels to HQ USAF/A4LE, referencing specific STS paragraphs.
