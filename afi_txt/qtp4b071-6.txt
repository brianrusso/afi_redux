Why would an auger not be the sampler of choice for soil that is possibly contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs)?  A:  Augers churn the soil; therefore, any VOCs present would rapidly release into the air.  (Source: 4B051 CDC)  2.  If the site of a soil collection sample is clay-like, which type of auger is best?  A:  The screw auger bores holes in the soil, and the sample is then collected with an alternate device such as a small hand shovel. Bucket augers are used for loose soil; therefore, the screw auger is the best choice.

Assess all hazards associated with the situation (i.e. hazardous atmosphere, hazardous conditions, etc.) and don appropriate PPE. Chip sampling is appropriate for porous surfaces and is generally accomplished with hammer and chisel. The sampling device should be laboratory cleaned, autoclaved, and wrapped in clean aluminum foil until ready for use. To collect the sample, a measured and marked off area is chipped both horizontally and vertically to an even depth of 1/8 inch. The sample is then transferred to the proper sample container.  6    AFQTP 4B071-6                                                                 Craftsman Training Guide:  Soil/Solid Sampling Strategy   TASK STEPS   1.

A trier sampler is a narrow tube (with a T-handle) that is open on one side and is used primarily for sampling of loose soil on the surface or just under the surface. It is not recommended for compacted soil, clay or rocky soil.

The 4.5.3.3 series of Craftsman Training Modules [(Spade, scoop or trowel)(Trier sampler)(Veihmeyer tube sampler)(Auger)(Chip/Core sample)] convey task steps for individual sample collection techniques that may or may not be used by all BE flights.

Refer to the flight Master Training Plan for specific training requirements. Ensure safety measures are used when collecting samples. Assess all hazards associated with the situation (i.e. hazardous atmosphere, hazardous conditions, etc.) and don appropriate PPE. The Veihmeyer is a good core sampler for most types of soil and can reach depths of up to 10 feet. It is the best sampler for undisturbed soil samples taken at depths greater than 1 foot. Its major limitation is that it cannot penetrate stony or rocky soil. The Veihmeyer sampler is used by driving the solid shaft to the desired sampling depth then driving a tube into the soil at the desired depth to collect the sample.  21    AFQTP 4B071-6                                                                 Craftsman Training Guide:  Soil/Solid Sampling Strategy  TASK STEPS    1.

Why is the presence of interferent gases cause for concern?    A:  Interferent gases can adversely affect the sampling device, causing inaccurate readings. (Source: 4B051 CDC)  2.  When calibrating the MSA multi-gas meter, how do you determine the meter’s sensitivity?  A:  Sensitivity must be tested on a known concentration of calibration gas equivalent to 25 to 60% of full scale concentration.  Accuracy must be within -0 to +20% of actual.     (Source:  USAF ESOH MSA PASSPORT Fact Sheet)  3.  When using the PID/FID, a contaminant source is indicated if the number of ppm reading on the TVA-1000B equals or exceeds what number? A:  A contaminated source is considered present if the PID/FID reading equals or exceeds 5.0 ppm.  4.  Along with providing real-time on-scene results, what is the biggest advantage of the HAPSITE chemical (Source: 4B051 CDC) identification system? A:  The biggest advantage the HAPSITE brings to the table is its ability of detecting contaminants of concern at levels below other detector’s threshold levels. The detection range of the HAPSITE extends into the parts-per-trillion (ppt) range.     (Source: 4B051 CDC)   5.  List three possible scenarios for using the HAZMAT ID.
