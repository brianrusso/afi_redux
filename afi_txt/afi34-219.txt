This  instruction  provides  guidance  for  all  personnel  that  procure,  sell,  serve,  or consume alcoholic beverages on Air Force installations or aircraft. 1.2.  Overall  Intent  and  Guidance  Concerning  Consumption  of  Alcohol  on  AF Installations.  The intent of this AFI is to empower commanders with the authority to permit the consumption  of  alcoholic  beverages  by  Airmen  and  guests  on  a  limited  basis.    In  the  process, leadership will deglamorize behavior associated with excessive drinking and avoid inappropriate and disorderly conduct.  (T-1)  It is also the intent of this instruction to ensure bystander Airmen are not negatively affected by this privilege or the unit does not become vulnerable to becoming an unprofessional or hostile work environment.  It is critical that commanders ensure their entire team is afforded the same, consistent work environment, avoiding scenarios where two disparate levels  of  professionalism  (normal  duties  co-located  with  members  consuming  alcoholic beverages) are allowed to coexist and detract from the mission.  Commanders will ensure their team  possesses  a  culture  of  professionalism  where  people  do  not  consume  alcohol  during professional  time  or  while  performing  official  duties.    Commanders  will  develop  compliance with the following mandatory guidelines: 1.2.1.  All Airmen, including uniformed military members and civilians, at all times, adhere to  AFI  and  appropriate  wing  supplements  regarding  alcohol  consumption  in  government facilities.  (T-1) 1.2.2.  Alcohol  may  only  be  consumed  in  government  facilities  at  commander-approved times  and  locations,  ensuring  mission  and  unit  readiness  are  not  negatively  affected.    (T-1)  Alcohol  may  not  be  consumed  by  members  while  performing  official  duties.    (T-1)    This authority may be delegated to the deputy commander only in the absence of the commander. 1.2.3.  Alcohol  consumption  within  squadron  or  unit  government  facilities  is  permitted  for Airmen and their guests during commander-approved sessions, celebrations or social events.  (T-1) 1.2.4.  Airmen and their guests maintain professional relationships and proper decorum at all times while consuming alcohol in government facilities.  (T-1) 1.2.5.  Consuming alcohol in government facilities under the aforementioned guidelines is a privilege and all personnel do so responsibly in every situation.  (T-1)  Commanders always ensure a safe and professional environment for all Airmen.  (T-1) 1.3.  Roles and Responsibilities 1.3.1.

Commanders  will  ensure  the  minimum  age  for  purchasing,  serving,  selling, possessing, or drinking alcoholic beverages on Air Force bases is consistent with the law of the state, territory, possession, or foreign country in which the installation is located.  (T-0)  Airmen  under  the  proscribed  legal  age  (by  the  law  of  the  state,  territory,  possession,  or foreign  country)  for  consumption  of  alcoholic  beverages  are  likewise  prohibited  from consumption  (inhaling,  ingesting  or  inoculation)  of  powdered  alcohol,  whether  in  liquid  or powdered  form.    (T-0)    Underage  Airmen  may  not  possess,  sell,  consume,  or  distribute powdered alcohol.   Military members will obey the mandatory provisions in  this paragraph or suffer a violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ.  (T-0) 1.4.2.  Commanders will prohibit the sale of powdered alcohol on AF bases.  (T-1) 1.4.3.  Servers and sellers of alcoholic beverages must verify the purchaser's age with a photo identification  card  (e.g.  active  duty  identification  card,  driver's  license,  passport,  reserve identification card, or family identification and privilege card).  (T-0) 1.4.4.  Adults  will  not  provide  alcoholic  beverages  to  minors  except  in  accordance  with applicable  state  laws.    (T-0)    Military  members  will  obey  the  mandatory  provision  in  this paragraph or suffer a violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ.  (T-0)  6 AFI34-219  30 SEPTEMBER 2016 1.4.5.  Military  personnel  18  years  old  or  older  may  purchase,  serve,  sell,  possess,  and consume alcoholic beverages outside the United States, its territories and possessions unless a  higher  drinking-age  requirement  exists  in  accordance  with  applicable  status  of  forces  or country-to-country  agreements.    A  higher  drinking  age  requirement  may  also  be  imposed based on the local situation as determined by the installation commander.  On joint bases, the supporting component will normally exercise the installation commander’s authority, or the senior  Air  Force  Officer  (SAFCO)  assigned  commander  when  there  is  no  installation commander.  (T-1)  Coordination with any host nation commander is required.  (T-0) 1.4.6.  As  states  enact  new  drinking-age  laws,  installation  commanders  must  make corresponding changes in base drinking-age guidance.  (T-0) 1.4.7.  The  Air  Force,  consistent  with  mission  needs,  will  cooperate  with  federal,  state  and local  officials;  however,  there  is  no  legal  obligation  to  submit  to  state  or  local  control  or regulation.  (T-0) 1.5.  Program Exceptions. 1.5.1.  The installation commander will not delegate the approval authority for exceptions to the minimum drinking age.  (T-0) 1.5.2.  The  installation  commander  must  obtain  approval  from  AFSVA/JA  to  approve  the following exception to standard guidance if state and federal law permit:  When an entire unit marks  a  unique  or  non-routine  military  occasion  on  a  military  installation,  the  minimum drinking age for attendees at a particular unit gathering may be lowered.  Minimum drinking age for entire unit unique or non-routine military occasions must be 18 or above.  (T-0) 1.5.3.  The  installation  commander  may  approve  exceptions  for  any  combination  of beverages,  including  the  following  common  groupings  (each  approval  document  must specifically state the alcoholic beverages that the exception covers): 1.5.3.1.

Beer, wine and distilled spirits.  (T-0) 1.5.4.  The  installation  commander  shall  reevaluate  the  exceptions  annually  and  send  an information copy of the continued exceptions to the Commander of AFSVA.  (T-2) 1.6.  Dram Shop Liability.  The "Dram Shop" theory is a legal theory of liability, created either by statute or court decision, which imposes upon the owner, operator and (or) employees of any establishment  serving  alcoholic  beverages  the  duty  to  refuse  to  serve  additional  alcoholic beverages to a customer who reaches or appears to be reaching the point of intoxication.  When an  establishment  continues  to  sell  alcoholic  beverages  to  such  a  customer  and  the  customer subsequently departs and causes harm to himself or herself, or to others, the owner, operator and (or)  employees  of  the  establishment  can  be  held  liable  for  damages.    To  protect  the  assets  and interests of Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIs) and the Air Force, personnel must adhere to the following procedures: AFI34-219  30 SEPTEMBER 2016 7 1.6.1.  Force Support Squadron (FSS) Flight Chiefs write and publish operating instructions (OIs)  that  prohibit  personnel  from  serving  alcoholic  beverages  to  individuals  who  appear intoxicated or close to being intoxicated.  The OIs must emphasize:  (T-1) 1.6.1.1.  The importance of curtailing alcohol or drug influenced incidents.  (T-1) 1.6.1.2.  The principles of Bystander Intervention.  (T-1) 1.6.1.3.  The responsibilities of employees in carrying out the drunk and drugged driving program.  (T-1) 1.6.1.4.  The importance of encouraging patrons to use a "designated driver" or "buddy" system.  (T-1) 1.6.1.5.  Supervisors must ensure servers record their understanding of Dram Shop theory of  liability  in  the  employee’s  work  folder,  Supervisor’s  Employee  Brief,  or  by  signing underneath  this statement,  “I understand my responsibility under the Dram  Shop theory of liability not  to  sell or serve alcoholic beverages to  persons who appear to  be nearing intoxication  and  not  in  complete  control  of  their  faculties.”    Supervisor  will  place  the signed statement in the comments section of the employee’s work folder.  (T-1) 1.6.1.6.  AAFES prescribes the statement to be signed by all AAFES employees. 1.6.2.  Activity  managers  ensure  proper  safeguards  or  controls  to  protect  the  welfare  of  an intoxicated patron.  (T-1) 1.6.3.  Activity managers promptly report any incident that may result in a potential claim to the  Force  Support  Squadron  commander  or  civilian  leader  (refer  to  AFI  34-208, Nonappropriated Fund Property and Liability Program).  (T-1)  AAFES activity managers’ report to the AAFES general manager for the base.  (T-0) 1.7.  Drunk  and  Drugged  Driving  Program  and  Bystander  Intervention.  Under  the  direct guidance  of  the  installation  commander,  the  Force  Support  Squadron  commander  or  civilian leader and AAFES manager must be familiar with the spirit and intent of all Air Force initiatives to eliminate drunk or drugged driving incidents, as well as initiatives to eliminate sexual assault and other misconduct involving patrons of base FSS and AAFES facilities.  (T-1) 1.7.1.  The  installation’s  Sexual  Assault  Response  Coordinator  (SARC)  responsibilities include  providing  all  FSS  personnel  who  serve  alcohol  Bystander  Intervention  Training within 90 days of  employment  and providing a list  of attendees for training sessions to  the Force Support  Squadron.  Volunteers serving alcohol  at  events  approved by the installation commander, either on or off the installation, must receive BIT prior to the event.  (T-1) 1.7.1.1.  Minimally, an alcohol server is required to successfully complete BIT once.  (T-1) 1.7.2.  The  installation  commander  will  verify  the  Force  Support  Squadron  commander  or civilian leader holds annual training programs to familiarize beverage supervisors and servers with Air Force policies.  (T-1) 1.7.3.  The FSS commander or civilian leader will: 8 AFI34-219  30 SEPTEMBER 2016 1.7.3.1.

Installation commanders, AAFES managers and FSS Commanders,  Civilian  Leaders,  Flight  Chiefs  and  Activity  Managers  will  implement  the  Air Force's Alcohol Deglamorization Program at the base level.  (T-1) 1.8.1.  To oversee the base program, installation commanders follow these procedures: 1.8.1.1.  Ensure activities serving alcoholic beverages do not promote excessive drinking. 1.8.1.2.  Ensure activities serving alcoholic beverages also offer nonalcoholic beverages. 1.8.1.3.  Establish in writing the hours during which alcoholic beverages by the drink are sold on the installation. 1.8.1.4.  Coordinate  the  hours  of  operation  for  package  beverage  sales  with  AAFES  to provide  reasonable  service,  meet  local  conditions  and  recognize  the  unique  mission  of military personnel. 1.8.1.5.  Ensure  there  is  no  issuance  of  coupons  for  reduced  prices  on  alcoholic beverages. 1.8.1.6.  Ensure  alcoholic  beverages  are  not  provided  free  of  charge  except  for promotional tasting as approved by the installation commander. 1.8.2.
