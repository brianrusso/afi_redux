AF Qualification Training Package (AFQTP). The AFQTP is an instructional package designed foruse at the unit level to qualify (or aid qualification) in a duty position, program, or on a piece of equipment.  It  may  be  printed,  computer-based,  or  in  other  audiovisual  media  (reference  AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force Training  Program).  Established  to  provide  standardized  OJT  Program  qualification  and  certification standards, AFQTPs are mandatory for use during UGT and OJT certification (where indicated).   2. This QTP was developed to provide a training aid, performance support tool, and qualification checklistto assist AOP officers (the trainee) to develop technical skills essential to the safe operation of the Reduced Oxygen  Breathing  Device  (ROBD)  and  Hypoxia  Familiarization  Trainer  (HFT).    The  tasks  are  broken down into teachable modules which will help the trainer guide the trainee to becoming proficient with the tasks.  The QTP will also aid the trainer when evaluating trainee task performance and for task certification (where required). 3. Trainer Instructions: Direct the trainee to review the associated training materials to better understandthe  objective  and  tasks  of  each  module  (request  access  to  the  training  materials  by  emailing usafsam.fepe.43A@us.af.mil).  Go through the steps in the task performance with the trainee and allow for enough time for them to learn and practice each task/step.  Note: some objectives and tasks may take more time than others. Remember, the purpose of the QTP is to ensure that the trainee can perform each task thoroughly to meet the objective. When the trainee receives enough training and practice, and is ready to be evaluated  on  an  objective,  follow  the  evaluation  instructions  for  each  module.  Use  the  performance checklists  included  in  this QTP as  you  evaluate  each  task.  Document  successful  task  completion  in  the appropriate section of the individual’s CFETP.  If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, provide feedback on the areas/tasks needing more training and practice until the objective is met.  Completed QTPs should be maintained with the CFETP. 4. The goal of this QTP is to provide a useful document for trainers and trainees to meet Air Force needsunder  the  concepts  outlined  in  the  43AX  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP).  AOP leadership  values  your  expertise  in  meeting  this  goal;  if  you  find  discrepancies  in  this  QTP,  have suggestions for improvement of the document, or if you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP, please send an email to: usafsam.fepe.43A@us.af.mil. 4 MODULE 1 SUBJECT AREA: Reduced Oxygen Breathing Device (ROBD) and Hypoxia Familiarization Trainer (HFT) 43A CFETP/STS REFERENCE(s):   12.1.
