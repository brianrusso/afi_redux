General.  This  instruction  prescribes  basic  guidance  for  training  United  States  Air  Force Small Unmanned Aircraft System Operators (SUAS-O).  Small UAS are defined as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) less than 1320 pounds gross weight (DOD Groups 1, 2, and 3 of Figure A2.1).    Air  Force  Special  Operations  Command  (AFSOC)  is  designated  Lead  Command  IAW AFPD 10-9 for Groups 1-3 UAS (referred to as SUAS).  Coordinating SUAS with other manned and  unmanned  aircraft  and  surface  maneuver  units  requires  detailed integration  and understanding  of  the  tactical  environment.    All  training  procedures  for  Group  1  UAS  are consolidated  into  AFI  11-5GP1-SUAS,  Volume  1  as  the  Group  1  Mission,  Design,  Series (MDS)-specific AFI.  Each Group 2 and 3 UAS shall have an AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 1 1.2.  Key Definitions: 1.2.1.  “Shall” indicates a mandatory requirement. 1.2.2.  “Should” indicates a recommended procedure that is required, if practical. 1.2.3.  “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.3.  Program  Objectives.  The  overall  objective  of  the  SUAS  training  program  is  to  develop and  maintain  a  high  state  of  mission  readiness  for  immediate  and  effective  employment  across the range of military operations.  The Air Force SUAS Training Program ensures all SUAS-Os obtain and maintain the qualification and proficiency needed to  effectively perform  their unit’s mission. Programs should strive to minimize the amount of retraining necessary when personnel return to duties for SUAS in which they were previously qualified. 1.4.  Waivers and Waiver Authority.  Unless otherwise specified in this instruction, HAF/A35 is the waiver authority for this instruction. 1.4.1.  The  fundamental  aim  of  a  waiver  must  be  to  enhance  mission  effectiveness,  while preserving  resources  and  safeguarding  health  and  welfare.    A  waiver  is  a  method  for  a commander  to  communicate  a  risk  management  decision  for  a  specified  time  period  or circumstance IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. 1.4.2.

Mission qualification training is required to qualify a SUAS-O to employ SUAS in support of the unit mission. It is the process to transition a BAQ SUAS-O to Mission Ready (MR)  status.    AFI  11-5MDS  Volume  1  prescribes  minimum  training  requirements  to  qualify individuals in unit missions.  (T-2) 4.1.1.  MQT  begins  after  IQT  is  completed.    MQT  is  a  unit-level  program  that  qualifies SUAS-Os  on  unit-specific  equipment  and  procedures  to  prepare  them  to  employ  SUAS  in support  of  the  unit’s  DOC  mission.    MQT  programs  are  normally  developed  by  each  unit, capture and incorporate tactical “Lessons Learned” from multiple sources, and are approved by  MAJCOM.    MQT  builds  upon  the  training  received  in  IQT  and  consists  of  academics coupled  with  supervised  and  graded  SUAS  missions  under  varying  conditions.  Note:  This chapter does not apply to USAFA/ROTC/OTS cadets. 4.1.2.  Units are allowed to tailor their programs to individual operators.  This is based on the individual’s  current  qualification,  experience,  currency,  documented  performance,  available training  assets,  and  formal  training.    Applicable  portions  of  MQT  may  be  used  to  create  a requalification  program  for  operators  who  have  regressed  from  MR  to  specifically  address the deficiencies that caused the regression.  Newly-assigned SUAS-Os shall complete at least one SUAS flight under the supervision of a SUAS-I. 4.1.3.  With  group  commander  (ANG  squadron  commander)  approval,  upgrade  training requirements  may  be  completed  during  operational  missions.    Comply  with  restrictions  in appropriate  AFI 11-5MDS  instructions, MAJCOM directives, and the applicable operations order. 4.2.  Administration.

Upon  completion  of  MQT,  the  upgrading  SUAS-O  shall  receive  a  Mission Qualification flight Evaluation from a SUAS-E. Refer to AFI 11-502, Volume 2.   16  AFI11-502V1  19 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 5 CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT) 5.1.  General.  The  continuation  training  program  provides  SUAS-Os  with  the  quantity, frequency,  and  mix  of  training  necessary  to  maintain  proficiency  in  the  assigned  qualification level.    AFI  11-5MDS,  Volume  1  shall  prescribe  CT  requirements  to  maintain  currency  and mission status.  Unit commanders shall document any additional CT tasks required to accomplish the unit’s mission in a unit supplement to AFI 11-5MDS instructions.  (T-2) 5.2.  Training  Periods  and  Events.  Continuation  Training  shall  be  measured  over  the semiannual periods defined by MAJCOMs.  Training events shall be specified by quantity within the semiannual training periods and by currency intervals for selected events.  This insures that a sufficient  repetition of training events  is  accomplished, as well as requiring recency of training so that a specified degree of proficiency is maintained.  Specific training events, quantities, and currency requirements shall be specified in the AFI 115MDS, Volume 1. 5.3.  Status.  A member may be assigned Basic Aircraft Qualified, , or Mission Ready status. 5.3.1.  Basic  Aircraft  Qualified  (BAQ).    (T-1)    The  minimum  standard  that  all  SUAS-Os shall maintain.
