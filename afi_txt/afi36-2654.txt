Compliance with this memorandum is mandatory.  To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force publications; the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.  In advance of a rewrite of AFI 36-2654, the attachment to this memorandum adds a requirement for arming group B personnel postured against a deployable (DW) UTC position to complete small arms qualification training every 36 months.  Units have up to 36 months from the date on this guidance memorandum to fully implement these changes.       This document becomes void after one year has elapsed from the date of this memorandum, or upon publishing of an interim change to, or rewrite of AFI 36-2654, whichever is earlier.        Attachment:  Guidance Changes   JOHN B. COOPER, Lieutenant General, USAF DCS/Logistics, Engineering, & Force Protection   ATTACHMENT  Guidance Changes  The below changes to AFI 36-2654, dated 13 January 2016, are effective immediately.  (Replace) 5.5.2. Individuals/AFSCs who are not armed in-garrison or identified as Group A and are only armed for contingencies are Group B.    (Added) 5.5.2.1. Group B personnel postured against a deployable (DW-coded) UTC position will complete small arms qualification training every 36 months (T-3).  Individuals qualify on the weapon(s) (rifle/carbine or handgun) identified by their assigned UTC position and wearing ICE as outlined in paragraph 5.3.4. When tasked to deploy, these individuals will complete pre-deployment qualification training, as outlined in paragraph 5.13. and sub-paragraphs, unless they have completed qualification training within 12 months of the deployment departure date (T-1). Qualifications expire on the last day of the month, 12 months from the date of qualification (e.g., individual qualifies on 10 Mar 17, their expiration date will be 31 Mar 18).  The qualification is valid for deployment for 12 months from the date of qualification and qualifications do not expire during deployments.  NOTE:  Units track personnel to determine when 36-month training is required (36 months from the last qualification date).     (Added) 5.5.2.2. All other Group B personnel complete SA/LW qualification only when they are identified by name by their commander to fill a deployment tasking where SA/LW qualification is identified as a requirement on the deployment tasking (actually deploying, not merely subject to deployment). These individuals must qualify on the rifle/carbine or handgun AFQC and any other SA/LW identified in their deployment tasking (T-1). These individuals complete qualification training as outlined in paragraph 5.13. and sub-paragraphs. These Group B qualifications are valid for 12 months or the length of the deployment, whichever is longer. If required to qualify for reasons other than a contingency deployment, such as overseas assignment or non-contingency deployment, these qualifications are valid for 12 months. Qualifications expire on the last day of the month, 12 months from the date of qualification (e.g., individual qualifies on 10 Mar 17, their expiration date will be 31 Mar 18).   (Replace) 5.13.1. All personnel identified by name by their commander to fill a deployment tasking to a combat zone in time of war or a designated hostile fire area (actually deploying, not merely subject to deployment) will complete live-fire qualification training on all individual (e.g., rifle, carbine, handgun, grenade launcher, shotgun, submachine gun, automatic rifle) and crew-served (e.g., light, medium and heavy machine guns) SA/LW, identified for the deployment. Group B personnel will complete this training within 120 days (180 days for crew-served SA/LW) of the date they final out-process their home station for deployment, unless they have completed qualification training within 12 months of the deployment departure date as outlined in paragraph 5.5.2.1. (T-1). This qualification will be valid for 12 months or the entire duration of the deployment, regardless of length. The SA/LW training requirement is identified on the individual’s deployment orders. Students present a deployment tasking letter signed by their unit commander or designee (e.g., UDM or UTM) when reporting for training.   2 (Replace) 5.13.5. For individuals that qualify under the guidance in paragraph 5.13.1., if their deployment departure is delayed for any reason, they remain deployment qualified for up to 12 months.  3 Administrative Changes to AFI 36-2654, Combat Arms Program  OPR: HQ USAF/A4SX  References throughout to “AFMAN 36-2227, Volume 1, Combat Arms Training Programs Individual Use Weapons, and Volume 2, Combat Arms Training Programs Crew Served Weapons,” are hereby changed to “AFMAN 36-2655, USAF Small Arms and Light Weapons Qualification Programs.”  References throughout to “AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual,” are hereby changed to “AFMAN 31-129, USAF Small Arms and Light Weapons Handling Procedures.”  The address for recommending changes in the opening paragraph “HQ USAF/A4SX, 1517 Billy Mitchell Blvd, Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, TX 78236-0119,” is hereby changed to “HQ USAF/A4SX, 1030 Air Force Pentagon Suite 5E1040 Washington DC 20330-1030.”  Delete sentence, “Do not use the Air Force Innovative Development through Employee Awareness (IDEA) Program to suggest changes to Air Force qualification courses of fire” from opening paragraph on page 2.

Purpose:  Provides guidance for efficient management of the base Combat Arms program and  administration/safe  operation  of  Air  Force  SA/LW training  and  maintenance complexes/facilities. 2.2.  Combat  Arms  :  The  Combat  Arms  section  implements  SA/LW  training  through  the  Air Force  SA/LW  qualification  training  program  and  executes  the  SA/LW  inspection  and maintenance  program.    The  following  paragraphs  aid  in  operation  and  administration  of  the Combat  Arms  section.    In  some  cases,  this  is  an  expansion  of  responsibilities  listed  for  the Combat Arms section organizational commander and the Combat Arms NCOIC. 2.2.1.  Administration.    Combat  Arms  sections  need  to  enforce  accurate  and  timely management  of  their  administrative  functions  to  accomplish  their  mission.    Combat  Arms will use SFMIS to document daily training and maintenance operations.  (T-1). 2.2.2.  Combat Arms Program Measurement.  AFSFC/FGWL measures training, manpower, ammunition  expenditure,  range  facilities  and  firearm  types/quantities  on  a  recurring  basis.  AFSFC/FGWL  obtains  this  data  through  SFMIS  using  the  Combat  Arms  module.    These reports  cover  the  fiscal  year  period  1  Oct  through  30  Sep.    Combat  Arms  field  units  enter data into SFMIS and keep it current. 2.2.3.  Reference  Library.  Combat Arms  sections will establish and maintain  an up to  date reference library (may be electronic or a combination of electronic and hard copy) containing applicable  DoD  and Air  Force publications,  TOs, US  Army manuals,  commercial manuals, copies of MAJCOM and locally produced supplements/Operating Instructions (OIs), as well as other guidance required to perform the Combat Arms function.  (T-1).  Periodically check Air Force indexes for changes to  publications and TO indexes for new or changed manuals covering  tools  (e.g.,  hand  and  power),  equipment  (e.g.,  binoculars,  scopes,  night  vision devices  [NVD],  machinery),  gauges,  ammunition,  SA/LW,  mounts,  etc.  to  ensure  proper guidance on maintenance, repair, and handling is available.  (T-1).  Attachment 1 contains a listing  of  references  relating  to  the  Combat  Arms  function.    Combat  Arms  unit  type  codes (UTC) may use an electronic reference library. 2.2.4.

Weapon  Maintenance  Procedures.   Define  procedures  for  all  SA/LW maintenance,  scheduling,  repairs,  documentation,  parts  accountability/inventory  and safety.  Most parts are coded as pilferable items and are subject to Air Force audit review.  This  audit  trail  needs  to  accurately  track  the  requisition  of  parts  (from  Combat  Arms), accountability  and  disposition  of  the  end  item.    At  a  minimum,  Combat  Arms  will conduct  an  inventory  of  all  SA/LW  parts  annually  (every  12  months).    (T-1).    A  non-Combat Arms, disinterested NCO will observe and validate this inventory.  (T-1). 2.2.5.17.  Scheduling.    Explain  all  necessary  procedures  and  activities  for  scheduling training  and  range  operations.    This  includes  dealing  with  unit  schedulers.

Non-Military/Civilian Use of Ranges.  Define the procedures and practices for personnel to use Combat Arms facilities for other than official military training.  Describe range  official  certification  process,  identify  personnel  limitations,  range  restrictions, conduct,  authorized  and  prohibited  firing  operations,  mishap  and  hazard  reporting procedures, opening and closing procedures and emergency notification procedures. 2.2.5.21.  Certification of non-Combat Arms Personnel.  Identify the criteria and process for certifying personnel to operate the firing range.  Include duration of certification and recertification procedures. AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   21  2.2.6.  Support Agreements.  The Combat Arms NCOIC works with the Logistics Readiness Squadron Support Agreements manager on creation and maintenance of support agreements pertinent  to  Combat  Arms  support  of  tenant  units  and  other  organizations.    (T-3).    Combat Arms  maintains  approved  copies  of  all  in-force  Support  Agreements  in  which  they  are involved. 2.2.7.  Budget  Requirements.    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  will  prepare  and  submit  annual budget  inputs  for  all  resources  necessary  to  accomplish  the  mission.    (T-3).    The  Combat Arms section is responsible for the SA/LW maintenance and training of the entire installation including tenant units with approved support agreements (SA) and geographically separated units assigned to the wing or with approved SAs and budgets accordingly. 2.2.8.  Evaluations.    All  instructors  who  perform  SA/LW  training  and/or  maintenance  will have  current  evaluations  (instructor  and/or  maintenance)  as  required  in  paragraphs  3.3.  and 3.4.  dependent  on  their  duties.    (T-1).    Commanders  should  consider  requiring  the  Combat Arms Armory NCOIC to maintain current instructor and weapon maintenance evaluations to provide a force multiplier for the Combat Arms section during surges in SA/LW training or maintenance requirements or manning shortages. 2.2.9.  Munitions. 2.2.9.1.  The Combat Arms NCOIC will maintain ammunition accountability records for expenditures,  issues  and  turn-ins  IAW  AFI  21-201  and  local  Logistics  Readiness directives and procedures.  (T-1). 2.2.9.2.  Ammunition  Authorizations  and  Forecasting.    AFI  21-201  outlines  standard forecasting procedures.  Use AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1, AFCAT 21-209, Volume 2 and the GMAT, to develop appropriate requirements forecasts.  Commands and/or units will prepare  and  submit  a  Peacetime  Conventional  Ammunition  Requirements  (PCAR) forecast  using  the  Forecast  and  Allocation  Module  (FAM)  of  the  Agile  Munitions Support Tool (AMST).  (T-2). 2.2.9.3.  Handling of Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard.  Combat Arms will store, handle and process expended munitions residue IAW DoDI 4140.62, Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard, and AFI 21-201.  (T-1). 2.2.10.  Weapons  Maintenance  Log.    Combat  Arms  will  maintain  a  permanent  SA/LW maintenance  log  (may  be  electronic)  of  all  maintenance  performed  and  parts  replaced  on each  SA/LW  repaired  (Combat  Arms  records  all  maintenance  performed,  even  if  parts  are not  used).    (T-2).    The  weapons  maintenance  log  provides  a  historical  record  of  parts  used and maintenance performed.  The maintenance log includes the model, type, serial number, owning  organization,  maintenance  accomplished,  stock  number/nomenclature  of  parts replaced, and total man-hours used to complete the repair for each weapon repaired.  This log is separate from SFMIS and should support data entered into SFMIS.  Weapons maintenance actions are also documented on the weapon’s Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 105, Inspection  Maintenance  Firing  Data  for  Ground  Weapons,  IAW  TO  11W-1-10,  Recording of Historical Data for Small Arms, using SFMIS. 2.2.11.  At  least  annually,  obtain  a  serialized  listing  from  the  base  Logistics  Readiness Squadron/Unit  of  all  SA/LW  assigned  to  the  installation,  identified  by  unit.    If  automated,   22  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 this  listing  can  be  used  in  a  spreadsheet  format  as  an  individualized  weapon  status  report, which provides a working resource for individual SA/LW actions such as inspections. 2.2.12.  Maintain  PMEL  documentation  provided  by  the  PMEL  office  for  all  SA/LW inspection gauges in use by the Combat Arms section. 2.2.13.  SA/LW Inspection Reports.  Combat Arms will complete a SA/LW inspection report for every field-level serviceability inspection they conduct, regardless of the type of or reason for  the  inspection.    (T-1).    Describe  the  type  of  inspection  (e.g.,  Semi-Annual,  Pre-Embarkation, Pre-Issue, Turn-In), total number of SA/LW inspected, identified by type and status  of  SA/LW  (extended  storage,  in-use  or  deployed).    List  all  SA/LW  with  uncorrected discrepancies  and  include  the  SA/LW  model,  caliber,  serial  number,  discrepancy,  and required corrective action.  Document discrepancies corrected at the time of inspection by the type  and  number  of  SA/LW  and  a  brief  description  of  the  discrepancies.    For  example:  "Three  M4  carbines  found  with  firing  pins  installed  incorrectly--Corrected  at  time  of inspection.” 2.2.13.1.  Combat Arms sections will accomplish a SA/LW inspection report for all types of  inspections  (e.g.,  Semi-Annual,  Pre-Embarkation,  Pre-Issue,  Turn-In).    The  Combat Arms  NCOIC  will  prepare  the  initial  report  within  five  duty  days  of  completing  the inspection.    Address  the  report  to  the  weapon  custodian  of  the  unit  possessing  the SA/LW,  with  a  realistic  suspense  date  to  correct  the  discrepancies  (not  to  exceed  30 calendar  days).    (T-3).    Ensure  the  cover  memo  or  report  instructs  the  custodian  to receive  their  unit  commander’s  endorsement  on  the  report  after  all  discrepancies  are corrected  and  before  returning  it  to  the  Combat  Arms  NCOIC.    If  owner  user maintenance  or  corrective  action  is  required,  Combat  Arms  must  complete  a  follow-up inspection within 30 calendar days of the initial  report date.   (T-2).  The Combat Arms NCOIC must complete a report (if open discrepancies continue to exist) or memorandum to the inspected unit weapon custodian (if all discrepancies are corrected) for all follow-up inspections, using the previous guidance for initial inspection reports.  (T-3).  Refer to the  USAF  Combat  Arms,  AFNet,  EIS  website  (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/) for an example of a SA/LW inspection report and memo. 2.2.13.2.  If no discrepancies are noted, the Combat Arms NCOIC will prepare a memo to the unit weapon custodian indicating the date and type of inspection, as well as listing the quantity (by model), model, and storage status of SA/LW inspected.   (T-3).  The memo includes a statement informing the unit that no further action is needed. 2.2.13.3.  The Combat Arms section will maintain copies of the last two unit inspection reports  for  each  type  of  inspection  and  maintain  pre-embarkation  inspections  until deployed  SA/LW  return  to  home  station.    (T-3).    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  will maintain statistics on inspections conducted in SFMIS.  (T-3). 2.2.14.  Combat Arms Scheduling.  The Combat Arms NCOIC will maintain records of unit annual  training  requirements,  requests  for  training,  SA/LW  qualification  training  statistics, class/range  schedules  and  range  utilization  data.    (T-3).    Combat  Arms  will  develop  a scheduling  handbook  for  unit  scheduling  officials  that  explains  the  process  and  identifies local  requirements  for  obtaining  Combat  Arms  training  quotas,  as  well  as  briefing  unit representatives on these items.  (T-3). AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   23  2.2.14.1.  Training  Schedules.    Develop  SA/LW  training  schedules  to  ensure  maximum use  of  Combat  Arms  facilities  and  resources.    Instructor  availability  is  a  key consideration when developing schedules.  Schedules also consider and include time for SA/LW  inspections/maintenance,  range  maintenance,  instructor  training/evaluation, instructor proficiency firing, and unit sustainment/proficiency training programs. 2.2.14.2.  The  Combat  Arms  section  will  receive  an  annual  training  forecast  from  each supported unit.  (T-2).  This forecast identifies the number of personnel requiring SA/LW qualification  training  each  year  by  weapon  and  course,  and  includes  the  commander’s rationale  or  justification  for  the  training  (in-garrison/peace  time  arming  requirement, permanent change of station [PCS] overseas or deployment to a combat zone/designated hostile  fire  area).    Refer  to  AFI  31-117  for  additional  guidance  on  arming  plans.    Unit annual  training  forecasts  provide  the  basis  for  the  Combat  Arms  training  schedule.  Combat  Arms  schedules  a  sufficient  number  of  classes  for  each  weapon  and  course throughout the year to ensure unit training requirements are supported. 2.2.14.3.  Combat  Arms  uses  the  following  priorities  for  scheduling  individuals  for training.  The Combat Arms organizational commander may modify these priorities when base mission requirements dictate. 2.2.14.3.1.  Qualification  training  of  individuals  identified  by  name  by  their commander  to  fill  a  deployment  tasking  to  a  combat  zone  in  time  of  war  or  a designated  hostile  fire  area  (actually  deploying,  not  merely  subject  to  deployment), including zeroing of weapons for deployment. 2.2.14.3.2.  Qualification  training  of  individuals  being  permanently  reassigned overseas with a personnel processing code requiring SA/LW qualification. 2.2.14.3.3.  Qualification  training  of  individuals  defined  as  Arming  Group  A  in  AFI 31-117, including zeroing of weapons for in-garrison arming. 2.2.14.3.4.  Qualification training of any other individuals requiring arming to support operational missions. 2.2.14.3.5.  Mandatory unit sustainment training. 2.2.14.3.6.  Unit proficiency training, other than mandatory sustainment training. 2.2.14.4.  Unit  scheduling  officials  schedule  personnel  for  training  through  the  Combat Arms  section  using  SFMIS.    Although  other  systems  may  exist  that  perform  similar functions,  SFMIS  is  the  only  official  database  for  MAJCOM  and  Air  Staff  agencies  to access SA/LW qualification training and range utilization data. 2.2.14.5.  If  no-shows  or  poor  range  utilization  become  a  concern,  the  Combat  Arms NCOIC  establishes  an  effective  “no-show”  program,  at  the  discretion  of  the  Combat Arms organizational commander.  The program may include no-show letters, attendance statistics  or  unit  range  utilization  data,  at  the  commander’s  discretion.    The  key  to  this program is ensuring maximum use of available facilities and personnel to provide support for all base SA/LW training needs. 2.2.15.  Trespass Notices.  Annually, the Combat Arms NCOIC will place legal notices to the public  in  the  base  bulletin  and  base  newspapers.    Place  similar  notices  in  local  area newspapers if the base is considered an open installation, or all, or part of the range impact   24  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 area  lies  outside  secured  base  perimeters.    (T-2).    In  such  notices,  give  the  location  of  the range  or  ranges,  and  state  trespassing  is  not  only  illegal  but  also  dangerous  because  of gunfire.  Include in the notice: the office address, personnel to contact, and phone numbers to call  in  case  there  is  a  valid  need  for  entry.    Notices  are  not  required  at  overseas  locations where tensions are high and the local threat could cause such notices to bring undue attention to the base or for fully contained ranges. 2.2.16.  Firearms  and  Ammunition  Protection  and  Control.    Use  established  standards  for protecting sensitive conventional arms, major SA/LW parts and assemblies, ammunition, and explosives in the custody of any component of DoD.  DoD 5100.76-M, Physical Security of Sensitive  Conventional  Arms,  Ammunition,  and  Explosives,  AFPD  24-2,  Preparation  and Movement of Air Force Materiel and AFI 31-101 outline protection standards.  Combat Arms also needs to refer to the base integrated defensive plan (IDP) to ensure all local policies are followed. 2.2.17.  Annual Range Safety Inspection Reports.  The Combat Arms NCOIC will prepare a report  of  the  annual  range  safety  inspection  and  forward  the  report  to  the  Combat  Arms organizational  commander,  after  coordination  with  the  base  safety  office  and  all  other agencies  who  participated includes  any discrepancies/safety  items  noted  during  the  inspection  and  corrective  action  needed.    If discrepancies  are  identified,  the  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  must  also  include  a  completed  AF Form 4437, Deliberate Risk Assessment Worksheet, following the risk management guidance outlined in Attachment 2 of this publication.  (T-1).   The  report the in inspection.   (T-3). 2.3.  USAF    Use:  Safety  is  paramount  when  operating  Air  Force  firing  ranges.    At  least  two personnel  must  be  present  when  conducting  any  live-fire  operation.    (T-1).    The  host  base Combat Arms section is responsible for the military combat arms range program.  Combat Arms sections will develop a “range book” for use on the firing range during all live-fire operations.  It will include all items  necessary to  safely operate the range;  this book will  remain on the range while the range is in operation.  (T-2). 2.3.1.  Air Force units/personnel will not conduct any live-fire training on a range unless it is certified  for  Air  Force  use.    This  certification  is  not  required  for  ranges  managed  and operated by other DoD components.  (T-1).  If required to use non-USAF firing ranges (host nation,  DOE,  FBI,  local  civilian,  etc.)  for  SA/LW  qualification  or  proficiency  training,  the local  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  and  the  local  base  safety  representative  will  conduct  a  range certification  inspection  per  the  Risk  Management  (RM)  Evaluation  of  Existing  Range Facilities guidance at Attachment 2 to this instruction and the Small Arms Range Inspection Checklist at Attachment 3.  (T-1).  Bases use this guidance, along with the ETL titled “Small Arms  Range  Design  and  Construction”  and  any  future  published  guidance,  along  with  this instruction  to  accomplish  this  inspection.    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  must  develop  a localized version of the  Small  Arms  Range  Inspection Checklist  and consider unique items that  are  not  included  in  the  example.    (T-1).    This  inspection,  at  a  minimum,  covers  basic range  safety  and  Air  Force  training  requirements.    Non-USAF  facility  managers  are  not obligated to install equipment or modify their facilities to accommodate USAF courses.  The range  certification  inspection  ensures  the  facilities  meet  the  intent  of  USAF  training programs  and  do  not  expose  Air  Force  personnel  to  unmitigated  conditions  or  endanger others.    Document  the  certification  and  provide  a  copy  to  the  MAJCOM/A4S  and AFSFC/FGWL.    Exception:    HQ  AFOSI/XR  may  approve  use  of  civilian,  civilian  law AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   25  enforcement agency or other non-DoD federal agency ranges by Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) personnel for sustainment/proficiency training.  These ranges should be certified safe for use by federal, state or local governments. 2.3.2.  Military  Use.    Combat  Arms  live-fire  qualification  training  of  military/DoD  civilian and contract personnel has priority over any other use of the range.  This includes test firing of repaired SA/LW and zeroing firearms for operational use or deployment. 2.3.2.1.  Support  Agreements  (SA)  -  Training  Support.    The  host  Combat  Arms  section will provide SA/LW qualification training to those AFRC tenant units without their own AFSC 3P0X1B, SEI 312 or DoD civilian equivalent personnel assigned.   (T-2).  Tenant AFRC units without sufficient numbers of their own AFSC 3P0X1B, SEI 312, or civilian equivalent  personnel  assigned  and  present  during  a  Unit  Training  Assembly  (UTA), request  host  Combat  Arms  support  to  augment  their  personnel  during  qualification training through the host-base Security Forces/Combat Arms organizational commander.  If host Combat Arms manpower support is required, it is provided if manpower permits.  For AFRC units, this support includes complete access to all items necessary to conduct SA/LW qualification training.  Unless specified in the SA, and agreed upon by the host Security  Forces/Combat  Arms  organizational  commander,  this  support  does  not  include ammunition.    Formalize this  training  and/or  support  through  an  agreement  according  to AFI  25-201,  Intra-Service,  Intra-Agency,  and  Inter-Agency  Support  Agreements Procedures.    Tenant  AFRC  units  have  range  and  facility  priority  on  scheduled  UTA weekends over non-Air Force users and non-mission essential training. 2.3.2.2.  Unit  Sustainment  and  Proficiency  Training.    Organizations  with  approved sustainment and/or proficiency training munitions IAW AFCAT 21-209 and the GMAT are permitted to use the range on an “as available” basis.  Combat Arms sections promote this  program  and  should  facilitate  flexible  scheduling  as  long  as  this  training  does  not interfere  with  qualification  training.    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  must  approve  all  live-fire  courses  that  units  use  on  the  base  range  to  ensure  they  are  safe  and  within  the limitations  of  the  range.    (T-1).    Units  with  courses  approved  by  the  Combat  Arms NCOIC and  certified range safety officials as outlined in  the following paragraphs may use  the  range  without  Combat  Arms  supervision,  at  the  discretion  of  the  Combat  Arms organizational commander. 2.3.2.3.  All units using the range will have personnel task certified by the Combat Arms NCOIC.  Units require the following range safety officials, a chief range officer (CRO), in the grade of E-6 or above, and range safety officers (RSO) in the grade of E-5 or above or DoD civilians of equivalent grade.  (T-2).  The CRO has overall responsibility for all range  operations  and  safety.    The  RSO(s)  supervise  shooters  on  the  firing  line  and maintain shooter safety during firing.  The ratio of RSOs to shooters will be 1:3 for non-combat arms personnel conducting unit sustainment and/or proficiency training for rifle, handgun and shotgun.  (T-1).  Combat Arms will ensure that during range operations, at least  one  range  officer  (CRO  or  RSO)  is  present  at  the  range  that  has  received  and  can administer  Self-Aid  and  Buddy  Care  (SABC)  or  equivalent  first  aid  training.    (T-1).  Personnel  performing  CRO  and  RSO  duties  will  not  perform  any  other  responsibilities during range use.  (T-1).   26  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 2.3.2.4.  Combat  Arms  sections  will  develop  a  comprehensive  training  and  certification program through a range operations certification training course or similar program.  (T-2).    At  a  minimum,  the  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  will  include  opening  and  closing procedures,  weapon  safety,  RSO  ratios,  firing  line  procedures,  tower  operator  duties, SA/LW-clearing procedures, range limitations and emergency notification procedures in range  certification.    (T-1).    This  certification  must  include  evaluation  during  live-fire.  (T-1).    Combat  Arms  personnel  must  periodically  spot  check  units  during  range  use  to ensure they  follow proper procedures.   (T-2).  Combat Arms  should conduct  these spot checks  at  least  once  per  quarter  for  each  unit  and  maintain  a  locally  developed  log  of these checks.  The Combat Arms organizational commander will approve all range safety official training plans.  (T-2). 2.3.2.5.  Document  task  certification  of  Air  Force  members  on  AF  Form  1098  and  all personnel on AF Form 483.  Range safety officials must have an AF Form 483, signed by the Combat Arms NCOIC, on their person while operating the range.  (T-2).  Maintain a locally  developed  training  log  of  all  personnel  certified  to  operate  the  range(s)  and indicate  when  their  certification  expires  (refresher  training  is  due)  at  the  Combat  Arms section.  Retain this log for 2  years  after the last certification date or as  directed by the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule. 2.3.2.6.  The Combat Arms organizational commander and individual’s unit commander must both appoint range safety officials in writing.  (T-3).  Combat Arms will maintain a copy of the appointment letter at the Combat Arms section.  (T-3).  This certification is valid  for  one  year  and  only  pertains  to  the  host  Combat  Arms  ranges.    Personnel  must complete refresher training annually to maintain their certification.   (T-1).  The Combat Arms NCOIC will revoke certifications if individuals fail to follow established guidance or operate the range in an unsafe manner.  (T-1). 2.3.2.7.  Range safety officials are responsible for safe range operations and will remain on the firing range until all SA/LW have been cleared and removed from the range.  (T-1).  Units/individuals using the range for this purpose are liable for damage caused during their use. 2.3.2.8.  The  requirements  in  paragraphs  2.3.2.2.  through  2.3.2.7.  also  apply  to  non-Air Force  ranges.    Individuals  must  follow  the  guidance  in  these  paragraphs,  in  addition  to host agency range requirements, for Air Force personnel to be authorized to use any non-Air Force range.  (T-1). 2.3.3.  Recreational  and  Nonmilitary  Use.    The  Combat  Arms  organizational  commander may authorize range use for recreational shooting activities including the firing of privately owned  firearms.    This  activity  cannot  interfere  with  the  completion  of  military  training  to meet  mission  requirements.    Before  granting  approval,  local  security  forces  and  the  staff judge advocate office (liability reasons) must coordinate on official nonmilitary range user’s requests  to  fire  privately  owned  weapons  (POWs)  on  base  firing  ranges.    (T-1).    Use  a support  agreement  or  memorandum  of  agreement/understanding  with  organizations  to identify  roles  and  responsibilities,  establish  internal  controls  and  provide  for  liability  for damage to  range facilities and equipment.  Recreational  shooters provide  their own targets, first aid kit and other associated supplies/equipment. AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   27  2.3.3.1.  The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  must  ensure  that  when  firing  is  conducted  on  Air Force  ranges  for  recreational  purposes,  no  less  than  two  people  are  present.    (T-1).  Combat  Arms  personnel,  as  a  minimum,  will  brief  the  CRO  on  range  safety,  operation policies  and  procedures,  and  provide  them  written  certification.    (T-1).    The  CRO  will ensure  that  the  other  person  is  a  minimum  of  18  years  old  and  capable  of  summoning assistance, if needed.  (T-1).  Firearms and ammunition fired on Air Force ranges cannot exceed range limitations.  Combat Arms  will approve weapons to  be fired on the range and the owner ensures the weapons are serviceable.  (T-1).  When shooting competitions are conducted on Air Force ranges, the CRO will brief instructors, safety personnel, and those managing the event on operating procedures, methods and commands used.  (T-1).  All personnel, including spectators, are under the control of the tower operator while on the  range  complex.    Combat  Arms  personnel  are  not  required  to  be  safety  officials  or tower operators for non-military purposes. 2.3.3.2.  Authorized  civilian  shooting  groups  may  use  Air  Force  ranges  during  those times  when  they  are  not  required  for  Air  Force  or  other  military  purposes.    These organizations  will  ensure  sufficient  personnel  receive  certification  training  outlined  in paragraphs 2.3.2.2. through 2.3.2.7. from the Combat Arms NCOIC to safely operate the range.  (T-1). 2.3.3.3.  Civilian police agencies using Air  Force small arms firing  ranges must comply with the requirements of paragraphs 2.3.2.2. through 2.3.2.7.  (T-1). 2.3.3.4.  Recreational  Use  of  Range  Property.    Base  agencies  such  as  CE  real  property, CE  environmental  flight,  base  safety  and  security  forces,  in  coordination  with  the  staff judge advocate, are responsible for safe implementation of this authorization. 2.3.3.5.  Recreational  activities  on  range  complexes  cannot  be  allowed  to  conflict  with SA/LW  qualification  or  sustainment  training  requirements.    The  installation  Combat Arms  section  will  control  and  schedule  range  areas  in  case  of  changes  in  training  or emergencies.  (T-3). 2.3.3.6.  Personnel, both military and civilian, must first demonstrate their firearm safety and proficiency to designated officials before they are allowed to use the range area for hunting.        (T-2).    Local  requirements  dictate  the  course  content  and  scope  of examinations for hunters. 2.3.3.7.  If  the  range  area  is  used  for  recreational  purposes,  post  the  date  and  hours recreational use is permitted and the range point of contact (POC) in the installation base bulletin  and/or  other  news  sources  once  a  week.    After  the  recreational  season  is  over, return the range area to a no-trespass basis and place this information in the base bulletin for at least three consecutive weeks. 2.3.3.8.  Non-DoD civilian shooters and range safety officials must sign a hold harmless agreement relieving the Air Force and DoD from any liability resulting from injuries or death  of  these  personnel  while  utilizing  the  base  range(s).    (T-1).    Combat  Arms  will obtain  approval  of  this  hold  harmless  agreement  from  the  installation  Judge  Advocate office  and  maintain  completed  agreements  in  the  Combat  Arms  section.    (T-1).    Non-DoD civilians are not authorized to use the range or supervise range operations without this agreement.  If the range is shared with the Morale, Welfare and Recreation Rod and   28  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 Gun Club, then utilization of the range by members of the public must be approved IAW AFI  34-101,  Air  Force  Morale,  Welfare  and  Recreation  (MWR)  Programs  and  Use Eligibility.  (T-1). 2.4.  Range Safety:  Combat Arms and units using the range must apply the RM process before conducting live-fire training.  (T-1).  Combat Arms or using units apply the RM process initially for  first  time  use  of  the  range  and  validate  that  conditions  have  not  changed  before  each subsequent  use.    Use  the  information  in  the  following  paragraphs  as  a  basis  for  this  process.  Local conditions may require additional safety precautions. 2.4.1.  Range  Facility.    Range  conditions  could  constitute  safety  hazards  and  cause  bounce backs  or  ricochets.    Excessive  rains  may  erode  berms  and  bullet  catches  so  they  do  not contain  bullets;  overhead  and  ground  baffles  rot  or  become  damaged  and  no  longer  stop bullets; and electrical wires become frayed and are no longer properly insulated.  Backstops (earth  or  metal)  can  develop  a  build-up  of  residue  and  pose  ricochet  hazards.    If  unsafe conditions  are  detected,  report  the  safety  hazards  to  the  appropriate  CE  section  and  base safety  official(s).    Inspect  ranges  for  safety  deficiencies  before  firing  each  day.    If  unsafe conditions  are discovered, correct  them  before the start  of firing.  On impact  ranges,  check entry  points  for  unauthorized  entry  and,  where  possible,  inspect  the  impact  area  before  the start  of  firing  to  make  sure  personnel  or  equipment  are  not  in  the  impact  area.    Ensure barriers and fences are in place.  Post a range safety plan in every range tower/control booth. 2.4.2.  Range Safety Plan.  A detailed plan of those predetermined hazards that could result in death or injury to any person at the facility and preventive measures.  Include by hazard all preventive measures, first aid, emergency contact information and reporting instructions.  A checklist format is permitted.  Use RM principles to develop the plan. 2.4.3.  Range Safety Rules.  Prominently display range safety rules on the firing range.  The Combat Arms NCOIC will ensure the sign includes, but is not limited to, the following rules:  (T-2) 2.4.3.1.  Treat all weapons as if they are loaded. 2.4.3.2.  Holster, clear, or secure all weapons when they are not in use. 2.4.3.3.  Keep the muzzle of the weapon under control at all times. 2.4.3.4.  Never point the weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot. 2.4.3.5.  No horseplay while on the range or while handling weapons. 2.4.3.6.  Do not handle weapons while personnel are down range. 2.4.3.7.  Do not handle weapons until instructed to do so by the range official. 2.4.3.8.  No smoking within 50 feet of the firing line. 2.4.4.  Road Guards.  Post road guards along frequently traveled trails or footpaths, at places where anyone might enter into range danger areas, and where adequate fences or barriers do not exist. 2.4.5.  Range  Communications.    Firing  ranges  need  to  have  effective  communications equipment  for  emergency  notification  and  communicating  with  students  and  instructors.  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   29  Ensure the systems are checked before live-fire operations.  Do not operate any firing range without the ability to contact emergency services. 2.4.6.  Display of Flag and Streamers.  Display a red streamer and/or a rotating red beacon at each  range  complex  entry  point.    A  rotating  red  beacon  is  used  during  night  firing.    This streamer or beacon indicates the range complex is in operation and firing is scheduled.  Place a sign near the range complex entry point, which reads “DANGER, FIRING IN PROGRESS WHEN RED FLAG IS FLYING (OR RED BEACON IS FLASHING).”  Streamers may be ordered or locally manufactured.  Flagstaffs used to display the streamer can be no less than 20 feet in height.  Flagstaffs used to display a rotating red beacon are at a height (depending on local conditions) allowing it to be visible to all personnel approaching the range complex.  If multiple ranges exist, each individual range displays an additional red flag (at least 2 feet by  3  feet)  and/or  a  rotating  red  beacon  while  the  range  is  in  operation.    Fully  contained ranges,  with  controlled  access  through  secured  doors,  do  not  require  streamers  or  beacons.  Instead, place a removable sign at the facility entrance to alert personnel firing is in progress. 2.4.7.  Emergency  Equipment.    Ensure  serviceable  fire  extinguishers  are  readily  available during range operations  and munitions movements.   Ensure a serviceable first  aid  kit and a serviceable vehicle (military or civilian) is immediately available (on the range) any time the range  is  in  operation.    Provide  an  approved  eyewash  station  for  students  and  instructors  in locations where chemicals are used for SA/LW maintenance.  Combat Arms will ensure that during range operations, at least one individual is present at the range that has received and can administer SABC.  (T-1).  All Combat Arms personnel will receive SABC or equivalent first aid training as a minimum; this does not prevent an individual from working the firing line while awaiting training.  (T-2). 2.4.8.  Unsafe  Acts  and  Conditions.    Range  personnel  have  the  responsibility  to  enforce proper safety procedures on firing ranges.  They have the prerogative, authority and duty to remove  any  person(s)  from  the  firing  line  or  the  range  whom  they  deem  unsafe.    Using appropriate military bearing and behavior, immediately remove any person(s) from the firing line  who  disregards  instructions,  or  violates  safety  practices.    In  the  event  an  individual refuses  to  leave  the  range,  contact  on-duty  security  forces  for  assistance.    If  a  person  is removed,  the  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  will  provide  a  written  summary  to  the  individual’s commander  with  a  courtesy  copy  to  the  commander  of  the  Combat  Arms  section.  Accomplish  this  within  five  duty  days  and  before  the  individual  is  allowed  to  return  for training.  (T-3). 2.4.9.  Safety  Equipment.    Units/sections  will  budget  and  forecast  for  the  procurement  of mandated personal safety equipment.  (T-3). 2.4.9.1.  Issued to Combat Arms Instructors: 2.4.9.1.1.  Combat Arms personnel will wear a red baseball type cap with the words COMBAT ARMS embossed with 1-inch black letters while performing duties on the range complex.  (T-2).  This allows students, visitors and shooters to rapidly identify Combat  Arms  personnel  for  assistance  and  to  report  safety  issues.    It  is  only  to  be worn while performing duties on the range complex and may not be worn outside the range complex.   30  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 2.4.9.1.2.  Eye protection with side protection, or wrap around in design and meeting ANSI Z87.1, standards, is mandatory for all instructors working or observing live-fire operations.    Combat  Arms  personnel  are  authorized  two  pair  of  high-quality  non-prescription  or  prescription  shooting  glasses  IAW  Allowance  Standard  Code  (ASC) 538,  Section  J.    Prescription  shooting  glasses  are  authorized  IAW  AFMAN  23-122, Materiel Management Procedures. 2.4.9.1.3.  To  decrease  the  risk  of  permanent  hearing  damage,  Combat  Arms personnel  must  be  issued  quality-hearing  protection,  meeting  the  level  of  protection determined by BE.  (T-0).  Electronic, noise cancelling hearing protection should be considered,  as  well  as  hearing  protection  that  provides  two-way  communication between range personnel. 2.4.9.1.4.  Firing line officials are authorized and should consider wearing protective fire  retardant  gloves  during  live-fire  operations  for  safety  and  protection  from  the elements.    Thin  gloves  protect  the  hands  and  allow  work  on  SA/LW  during immediate action procedures, clearing and repairing jammed SA/LW. 2.4.9.2.  Provide to the students: 2.4.9.2.1.  During live-fire training, all personnel will wear hearing protection.  (T-0).  Dual hearing protection may be necessary (for students and instructors) depending on decibel  levels  and  exposure  time.    BE  officials  will  determine  the  protection  level needed based on the noise levels and exposure time.  (T-2). 2.4.9.2.2.  All  personnel  occupying  the  range,  must  wear  eye  protection  meeting ANSI  Z87.1  standards  (maintain  adequate  quantities  for  all  firing  positions  and observers) during live-fire.  (T-0). 2.4.9.2.3.  Brass  deflectors  for  rifles,  if  available  and  approved,  are  used  to  help reduce the possibility of students being burned by hot brass. 2.5.  Live-Fire  Procedures:  Students  and  instructors  will  clear  all  SA/LW  transported  to  and from  the  firing  range.    (T-1).    Pistols  may  be  transported  to  the  range  cleared,  holstered  and secured.    Weapons  may  be  transported  to  the  range  by  each  shooter  once  cleared  by  Combat Arms  personnel.    Before  firing  begins,  the  tower  operator  or  certified  CRO  will  give  a  range safety briefing to all personnel scheduled to fire.  (T-1). 2.5.1.  Prefire Briefing.  Brief all students on each order of fire.  The Tower Operator or CRO will  include,  but  is  not  limited  to  briefing,  each  phase  of  fire,  positions  to  be  used,  time limits, number of rounds, rounds per magazine and number of magazines used.  (T-1). 2.5.2.  Ready Line.  The ready line is normally a yellow line placed to the rear of the  firing line.  Shooters will remain behind the ready line and at assigned firing positions until they are given  further  instructions.    (T-1).    The  tower  operator  will  notify  the  shooters  when  to proceed from the ready line to the firing line.  (T-1). 2.5.3.  Firing  Line.    The  firing  line  is  normally  a  red  line  where  the  shooter  occupies  a predetermined position and fires a course or order of fire.  Firing line officials must observe all personnel approaching, occupying, or departing the firing line as this is one of the times when  a  breach  of  safety  is  likely  to  occur.    Ground  SA/LW  at  the  firing  positions  with  the actions open, safety on,  and muzzles pointed downrange.  Shooters will handle the SA/LW AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   31  only on the tower operator's command.   (T-1).  Do not permit anyone forward of the firing line  until  the  line  is  declared  “safe.”    “Safe”  means  SA/LW  are  visually  inspected  for  safe conditions  by  range  personnel,  grounded  with  actions  open,  safety  on,  or  holstered  and secured.  Pistols may be holstered under the “hot range” (SA/LW loaded with a round in the chamber) concept providing line officials ensure pistols remain secured in place in between orders  of  fire.    During  orders  of  fire,  range  personnel  must  ensure  no  one  assumes  a  firing position  in  front  of  the  firing  line  and  all  shooters  are  aligned.    (T-1).    Firing  is  only permitted  from  the  firing  platform  when  using  a  partially  contained  baffled  range.  Authorization  may  be  given  to  coaches  to  occupy  the  firing  line  during  special  events  or training, as required.  Once firing has been completed, range officials will clear all SA/LW prior to the SA/LW being removed from the firing line.  (T-1). 2.5.4.  Target  Scoring.    Range  officials  score  and  record  student  targets  for  qualification evaluation  phases.    Each  shot  not  fired  for  any  reason,  other  than  ammunition  or  weapon malfunction, is counted as a miss.  In the case of re-fires for malfunctions, the time allowed is prorated  for  the  number  of  rounds  remaining  and  the  orders  of  fire.    Return  all  serviceable rounds  not  fired  for  any  reason  (example:  shooter  does  not  fire  all  rounds  within  the  time limit)  to  ammunition  stocks  for  future  use.    Annotate  this  in  the  remarks  block  of  the  AF Form  710,  Combat  Arms  Training  Record.    If  a  score  is  questioned,  the  highest-ranking Combat Arms individual on the range makes the final decision. 2.5.5.  Range Policing.  When practical, students police the range for spent brass, litter, and other materials.   Range  officials make sure the students in  their area police the range.  The tower  operator  or  a  designated  instructor  makes  sure  other  range  facilities,  such  as classrooms  and  cleaning  areas  (used  by  students  during  the  training  day),  are  cleaned  and policed.    Ensure  students  receive  a  briefing  on  all  health  hazards  and  protective  measures before performing range policing operations. 2.5.6.  Range  Commands.    The  range  commands  listed  in  Figure  2.1.  are  the  typical commands  for  conducting  rifle,  handgun  and  shotgun  courses  of  fire.    Additional  or substitute  commands  may  be  given  when  they  do  not  violate  safety  rules  or  cause  safety hazards.   32  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 Figure 2.1.  Range Commands. Examples of typical range commands.  CLEAR THE RANGE!   IS THE RANGE CLEAR?   THE RANGE IS CLEAR!   SHOOTERS MOVE FORWARD TO THE ______POSITION!   YOU MAY HANDLE YOUR WEAPONS!   SHOOTERS, THIS ORDER OF FIRE IS _____, YOU WILL FIRE ______ ROUNDS IN _____ SECONDS (or MINUTES)!   WITH ________ ROUNDS LOAD!   (Note: It may be necessary to repeat orders of fire, positions, number of rounds and time limits to ensure all shooters understand the order/phase of fire.)   IS THE LINE READY?   THE LINE IS READY! (or THE LINE IS NOT READY)!   FIRE!   CEASE-FIRE!  (see paragraph 2.5.7.)   ARE THERE ANY ROUNDS REMAINING?   INSTRUCTORS, TAKE CARE OF YOUR ALIBI SHOOTERS!   CLEAR, GROUND, OR HOLSTER AND SECURE ALL WEAPONS!   MAKE THE LINE SAFE!   IS THE LINE SAFE?   THE LINE IS SAFE!   GO FORWARD FOR TARGET ANALYSIS or (TO SCORE/ REPAIR/CHANGE TARGETS).    Examples of additional or substitute commands:  IS THE BAY CLEAR?   THE BAY IS CLEAR!   SHOOTERS, YOU MAY SAFELY HANDLE YOUR WEAPON AND MAKE ANY SIGHT ADJUSTMENTS. 2.5.7.  Cease Fire Commands.  The tower operator gives cease-fire commands with the use of a  distinctive  loud  whistle,  buzzer,  horn,  verbally  over  a  public  address  (PA)  system  or  the disappearance  of  the  target  through  a  turning  or  dropping  of  the  target  by  a  target  control system.  If there is an emergency, such as an accident, unsafe condition or aircraft within the range  airspace,  anyone  who  sees  it,  whether  it  is  range  personnel,  shooter,  or  spectator, immediately yells, "cease fire!" in a loud, clear voice.  The tower operator repeats the cease-fire command and then commands, "make the line safe!”  Regardless of who gives the cease-fire  command,  all  shooters  cease  firing  immediately.    After  range  personnel  correct  the condition causing the emergency, firing may resume. 2.6.  Range  Safety  Inspections:  The  Combat  Arms  section  will  inspect  ranges  and  other facilities using a locally developed guide and checklist following the RM Evaluation of Existing Range  Facilities  guidance  at  Attachment  2  to  this  instruction  and  the  Small  Arms  Range Inspection  Checklist  at  Attachment  3.    (T-1).    During  range  inspections,  ensure  all  potential AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   33  problem  areas  are  identified  for  maintenance.    Minor  shot  damage,  erosion,  peeling  paint,  etc., may become serious problems if not repaired early. 2.6.1.  The Combat Arms section will visually inspect the range(s) each day before the start of firing and when firing is completed.  (T-1).  Look for obvious indicators of potential safety problems  (e.g.,  exposed  rocks  exceeding  the  size  permitted  on  the  range,  loose  boards  on overhead baffles, debris  in the backstop/bullet trap, insect nests, walkways).  Combat Arms should  develop  a  simplified  checklist  using  the  Small  Arms  Range  Inspection  Checklist  at Attachment  3  for  daily  use,  focusing  on  the  most  critical  items.    This  is  not  the  same  type inspection  as  the  annual  range  inspection  outlined  in  paragraph  2.6.3.    The  Combat  Arms NCOIC will postpone firing until unsafe conditions are corrected.  (T-1). 2.6.2.  Schedule  other  inspections  to  coincide  with  programmed  range  inspections,  such  as quarterly self-inspections.  Document range condition and list maintenance needed.  Submit work requests through coordination channels to CE. 2.6.3.  Annually,  the  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  will  conduct  a  formal  range  inspection,  as outlined in paragraph 2.6.  (T-2).  The Combat Arms NCOIC should request assistance from base  safety,  CE  environmental,  CE  maintenance,  and  BE,  as  required.    Use  the  risk management processes outlined in AFI 90-802, Risk Management, and AFPAM 90-803, Risk Management (RM) Guidelines and Tools.  The Combat Arms NCOIC prepares a report of the inspection  as  outlined  in  paragraph  2.2.17.    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  ensures  corrective actions are taken to ensure safe range operation.  The Combat Arms NCOIC along with CE personnel  ensures  all  corrective  actions  and  repairs  comply  with  ETL  titled  “Small  Arms Range  Design  and  Construction”  criteria  or  future  published  guidance  and  this  instruction.  AFSFC/FGWL  and  local  Combat  Arms  officials  may  add  inspection  requirements  as necessary  to  meet  their  particular  situation.    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  maintains  the  last two  inspection  reports.    As  a  minimum,  inspect  the  items  listed  below.    NOTE:    All  Air Force  range  criteria  will  be  moved  to  the  Air  Force  Indoor  Small  Arms  Range  building information  modeling  (BIM) facilities criteria documents in  the  future  and this will replace the  ETL.    Users  may  obtain  the  BIM  documents  via  the  USAF  Combat  Arms,  Air  Force Network website (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/). Information Services (AFNet), Enterprise (EIS) 2.6.3.1.  Backstop Condition.  Dirt backstops need to be regularly checked for erosion.  If installed, check the bullet deflector/bullet catch for bullet holes and ensure the structure is firmly  attached  to  the  backstop.    Check  for  erosion  both  behind  the  targets  and  at  all points  facing  the  shooters.    Heavy  lead  buildup  could  cause  ricochets.    To  test  for excessive  leading  of  the  dirt  backstop,  tap  a  3/8-inch  rod  at  least  4-feet  long  into  the earthen backstop using a 4-pound (maximum) hammer.  Repeat this test on impact area from  all  firing  points.    The  rod  needs  to  pass  unimpeded  through  the  3-foot  layer  of topsoil.    If  the  rod  will  not  pass,  the  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  will  coordinate  required maintenance  (removal  of  built-up  lead  or  addition  of  earth)  before  continued  use  of  the range.  (T-1).  The Combat Arms NCOIC will ensure this inspection is accomplished and documented.    (T-1).    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  will  coordinate  with  the  local  CE environmental engineers to ensure compliance with federal, state and local requirements for disposal of hazardous material.  (T-1).   34  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 2.6.3.2.  Deterioration  of  Baffles  and  Supports.    Overhead  and  canopy  baffles  need  to completely  stop  all  direct-fired  rounds  of  the  caliber/type  with  the  greatest  penetration authorized for use on the range.  Visually check each baffle to make sure rounds are not passing  through  them.    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  will  ensure  that  baffles  that  are  not stopping fired rounds are modified to stop the rounds or firing is postponed until the base CE can repair or upgrade them.  (T-1). 2.6.3.3.  Exposed  Rocks.    On  baffled  ranges,  remove  rocks  larger  than  3/8-inch  in diameter from the range floor, backstop, side berms (from the range floor to the top of the berm).  Closely inspect these areas after severe weather as topsoil may erode and expose rocks.  For impact ranges, remove large rocks and boulders creating hazards to shooters on the range or people on adjacent ranges. 2.6.3.4.  Bullet Traps (Baffled Ranges with Metal Backstops).  Check for excessive bullet residue and/or lead build-up in trap area.  The cleaning schedule depends on the amount of  use  and  the  design  of  the  trap.    Periodically,  maintenance  personnel  need  to  remove bullet residue (lead, jacket and other residual material) from the bullet trap.  Coordinate with  the local  CE environmental  engineers to  ensure compliance with  federal,  state  and local requirements for disposal of hazardous material as outlined in AFI 32-7042.  Unless certified  to  handle  hazardous  material,  Combat  Arms  will  not  remove  or  handle  bullet residue  from  the  bullet  trap  or  filtration  system.    (T-1).    Use  of  contractors  for  these actions  is  preferred.    Inspect  and  maintain  commercial  backstops  IAW  manufacturer guidance.  Bullet traps also need to be inspected for warping of plates, closing/restriction of  bullet  entrance  areas  (trap  mouth),  exposed  hardware  or  misaligned  plates  (causing ricochet hazards) or openings in any area allowing rounds/fragments of rounds to escape from the trap. 2.6.3.5.  Cracks  in  Metal  Bullet  Traps  and  Support  Brackets.    If  cracks  are  detected  in metal  bullet  traps  or  their  supports,  repair  the  area  in  question  as  soon  as  possible.    If there  are  dimpled  areas  in  the  steel,  fired  bullets  could  return  toward  the  shooter  or  be deflected out of the bullet trap.  When making repairs, welds may not be permitted in the impact  area  directly  behind  the  target,  depending  on  the  design  and  manufacturer’s guidance.  Welds  will be finished and ground to  the same angle as the original surface.  Constant bullet strikes on a metal trap may cause fatigue cracks in the support brackets.  When  repairing  support  brackets,  do  not  change  the  angle  of  the  trap  from  the  original design. 2.6.3.6.  Impact ranges need to possess an adequate SDZ from any location that shooters fire from to ensure rounds fired remain within range boundaries.  Additionally, the ranges SDZ and VDZ are to be plotted on base maps to prevent encroachment. 2.7.  Range  Maintenance:  The Combat  Arms  section and CE organization are responsible  for upkeep  and  maintenance  of  ranges  and  range  facilities.    All  ranges  require  comprehensive regular  and  routine  maintenance.    A  proactive  maintenance  and  self-help  program  benefit  the Combat Arms section in maintaining safe, professional and long-standing facilities.  The Combat Arms NCOIC is responsible for ensuring range facilities are maintained in a safe condition and necessary repairs or upgrades are identified to the appropriate agencies in a timely manner.  The Combat  Arms  NCOIC  should  coordinate  with  the  local  CE  organization  to  determine  what agencies are responsible for specific maintenance tasks. AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   35  2.7.1.  Combat Arms is typically responsible for minor maintenance and upkeep of the range and support facilities.  This may include items such as repairing damaged facing material on baffles,  rebuilding  target  frames/holders,  maintaining  shooting  barricades,  repainting  target numbers,  close  in  mowing/weed  removal,  general  clean-up  and  other  maintenance/repair activities.  The Combat Arms NCOIC will coordinate all range maintenance operations with base safety, environmental engineering and BE to ensure all safety, environmental and health hazards are identified and adequate preventive measures are implemented.  (T-1). 2.7.2.  The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  will  ensure  that  all  assigned  personnel  receive  required training and that this training is documented as required by Air Force and local directives for operations they perform that may expose them health hazards such as lead dust, heavy metal dust  and  other  contaminates/hazards  that  collect  on  range  surfaces.    (T-1).    The  Combat Arms  NCOIC  coordinates  these  operations  and  training  with  the  base  BE  flight/element.  Some  operations  performed  by  Combat  Arms  personnel  may  require  special  personal protective equipment and associated training, such as protective suits and respirators.  These items  require  specialized  training/fitting  and  the  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  needs  to  obtain guidance and support from base BE personnel. 2.7.3.  The Combat Arms NCOIC needs to include time for this maintenance in the monthly schedule.    CE  provides  materials  to  the  Combat  Arms  section  for  approved  minor maintenance and self-help projects.   Deteriorated wooden material  removed from  the firing range may contain lead projectile residue.  Check with the CE environmental function and/or ensure  compliance  with  AFI  32-7042,  before  disposing  of  such  material,  as  it  may  be potential hazardous waste.  Combat Arms personnel will not perform range maintenance if a risk of exposure to  hazardous materials  exists without obtaining  guidance from  BE.   (T-1).  Contracting this function to a company that specializes in this type work, may be more cost effective and safe. 2.7.4.  The CE organization provides maintenance to ensure continued operation of the range and  range  facilities.    This  maintenance  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  the  replacement  of eroding  earth,  mowing/weed  eating  of  large  grass  areas  on  the  range  complex,  repair  or replacement of baffles and baffle supports, and emergency maintenance.  The CE scheduling office and the Combat Arms section jointly schedule required range maintenance.  The need to de-lead or resurface backstops/ bullet traps, replace or overhaul baffles, surface and repair range  roads,  parking  lots,  and  range  floors,  paint  range  and  range  facilities,  and  repair  or replace facilities is to be identified for scheduled maintenance. 2.7.5.  Mining  of  Backstops  and  Bullet  Residue  Removal  from  Bullet  Traps.    The  CE environmental flight advises on environmental protection requirements for de-leading and/or cleaning  bullet  traps  and  backstops.    BE  advises  government  personnel  on  health  risk management/health hazard exposure controls, for de-leading and/or cleaning bullet traps and backstops.    Compliance  with  environmental  cleanup  and  residue  disposal  is  mandatory.  Contract service for cleanup is preferred.  The  frequency of de-leading and residue removal depends upon the amount of lead accumulated, and the potential for unsafe conditions/health risks due to excessive lead build up.  Additionally, for commercial bullet traps, Combat Arms needs to reference the manufacturer’s guidance.  Combat Arms personnel will not attempt to perform  de-leading  projects.    (T-1).    Specific  hazards  are  associated  with  exposure  to  lead and bullet residue.   36  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 2.8.  Range Closures:  When a range is to be closed for more than 120 days, the Combat Arms organizational commander must notify the MAJCOM/A4S and AFSFC/FGWL by memorandum, e-mail, or message (during MINIMIZE, use mail).  (T-2).  At a minimum, coordinate with base safety,  CE,  BE  and  other  applicable  base/wing  agencies.    Include  the  following  information  as well as updating the range status in SFMIS: 2.8.1.  Date closed or planned closure date. 2.8.2.  Estimated length of closure. 2.8.3.  Projected reopening date. 2.8.4.  Reason for closure (if possible include costs of repairs). 2.8.5.  Type of training and number of people due training during period of closure. 2.8.6.  Nearest military and civilian installation with available range facilities. 2.8.7.  Actions taken to continue training. 2.8.8.  Date and length of time the range was last closed and reason. 2.9.  Range  Design  and  Support  Facilities  Criteria:  Use  the  most  current  ETL  titled  “Small Arms Range Design and Construction” criteria and any future published guidance, as well as the AFCEC  Building  Information  Modeling  (BIM)  guidance  when  planning,  constructing  and rehabilitating any type of range or range complex.  The BIM guidance incudes Facilities Criteria and a Dynamic Prototype Design for a standardized indoor small arms range and Combat Arms support facilities.  The ETL is directive in nature.  MAJCOMs or AFIMSC agencies may require additional criteria before projects are approved.  Range construction should take into account the need  to  fire  tracers  (as  part  of  a  course  or  accidentally  in  repacked  ammo),  target positions/distances (e.g., 10 meters for machine  gun (M/G), 7, 15, 25 meters for others), target width  (e.g.,  M/G  10  meter  target),  and  shooters  positions  (e.g.,  prone,  kneeling,  standing, barricades) used to engage the targets at varying distances.  If the range will use firing stalls or divided firing points, design them to allow block officials and the tower operator an unobstructed view of the firing line and shooters.  Ranges will not be designed for exclusive use of frangible ammunition and must be designed to contain operational (ball) ammunition.  AFSFC/FGWL and the  Engineer  and  Programs  Support  Division,  Engineer  Support  Branch,  AFCEC/COSC,  must approve  all  new  range  designs  and  major  renovations  (changes  to  the  type  or  function  of  the range).  For example, changing a partially contained range to a fully contained range or changing from an earthen backstop to a bullet trap constitutes major renovations.  MAJCOMs/Units should contact  AFSFC/FGWL  for  clarification  on  individual  renovation  projects  to  determine  if  they require  AFSFC  review.    This  approval  also  applies  to  modular,  portable  or  trailer  type  ranges.  (T-1).  HQ USAF/A4SX is the approval authority for deviations or waivers from design criteria and will coordinate requests with AFCEC/COSC. 2.10.  Facility  Certification:  Certify new and rehabilitated range facilities as meeting required specifications.    Conduct  and  document  this  certification  and  trial  operation  per  the  small  arms range  design  and  construction  ETL  or  any  future  published  guidance.   Certification documentation  consists  of  the  facility  acceptance  inspection,  test  fire  report  and  trial  operation report.    The  Combat  Arms  section  must  load  all  certified  non-USAF  firing  ranges  into  the SFMIS range module.  (T-1).  If this cannot be completed at base level, contact AFSFC/FGWL for assistance.  Combat Arms sections maintain this certification for the life of the range or until AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   37  the next certification is accomplished.  The Combat Arms section must update SFMIS with the status of all ranges at least annually and within five duty days after changes occur.  (T-2).   38  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 Chapter 3 TRAINING MANAGEMENT OF COMBAT ARMS PERSONNEL 3.1.  Purpose:  This chapter explains requirements for all Combat Arms instructors. 3.2.  Combat  Arms  Training  Requirements:  Combat  Arms  personnel  assigned  to  perform Combat  Arms  duties  either  at  home  station  or  deployed  must  meet  criteria  for  training  and qualification  identified  in  the  AFECD.    (T-1).    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  will  ensure  all assigned  Combat  Arms  personnel  are  trained,  evaluated,  maintain  skill  proficiency,  and participate  in  continuation  training.    (T-1).    For  upgrade  training,  unit-training  managers  enter newly assigned 3P031B personnel into the appropriate upgrade training status code  36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  AFSC 3P031B personnel should be utilized in their new specialty at the Combat Arms section, rather than in other duty positions, to ensure effective and timely on-the-job training (OJT) and advancement to the 5-skill level. 3.2.1.  Civilian  personnel  as  Combat  Arms  Instructors.    In  order  to  perform  Combat  Arms duties, traditionally performed by 3P0X1B or SEI 312 personnel, civilian instructors must be graduates of the Combat Arms Apprentice Course (or previous/future versions of the course).  (T-1).  If not a prior 3P0X1B/SEI 312, they must attend the Combat Arms Apprentice Course once  hired,  regardless  of  previous  experience.    (T-1).      USAF/A4S  manages  the  Combat Arms  civilian  force  as  part  of  the  Security  Forces  civilian  police  job  series  083.    HQ  Air Force  Personnel  Center  (AFPC)  provides  core  position  descriptions  including  medical requirements to accommodate the unique health risks associated with Combat Arms duties. 3.3.  Instructor Evaluations:  Combat Arms personnel who perform lead instructor duties must successfully  complete  a  lead  instructor  evaluation  on  each  SA/LW  for  which  they  provide training before being task certified to instruct the weapon without supervision.  (T-1).  Thereafter they  must  have  regular  evaluations  to  maintain  training  standards.    (T-1).    Use  the  instructor evaluation  checklist  posted  on the  USAF  Combat  Arms,  AFNet,  EIS  website (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/).    Modifications  to  the  checklist  are  not  allowed without approval of HQ USAF/A4SX.  (T-1). 3.3.1.  Lead Instructor Evaluations.  The Combat Arms NCOIC will evaluate lead instructors once the individual has successfully completed two training evaluations.  (T-1).  Satisfactory completion  of  this  evaluation  authorizes  an  individual  to  perform  lead  instructor  duties without  supervision.    The  evaluator  must  be  present  for  the  entire  program  of  instruction, including live-fire and preventive maintenance evaluation. 3.3.2.  Once  an  instructor  is  lead  instructor  task  certified  on  one  weapon,  they  need  only satisfactorily  complete  a  lead  instructor  evaluation  for  additional  SA/LW  on  which  they conduct training.  The trainer or Combat Arms NCOIC may conduct training evaluations for additional  SA/LW;  however,  they  are  not  required.    Newly  assigned  instructors  who  were previously  task  certified  on  a  weapon  and  completed  a  lead  instructor  evaluation  do  not require  another  lead  instructor  evaluation  on  the  same  weapon,  but  must  satisfactorily complete a lead instructor evaluation for SA/LW they are not certified to instruct.  (T-1). 3.3.2.1.  For lead instructor evaluations, the evaluation by the Combat Arms NCOIC must cover  the  complete  Air  Force  qualification  course  training  program  to  include performance of tower operator duties and evaluating preventive maintenance.  (T-1). AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   39  3.3.2.2.  All  tasks  performed  for  lead  instructor  evaluations  are  rated  on  the  evaluation checklist  for  certification.    The  instructor  being  evaluated  must  achieve  at  least  a satisfactory rating on all areas to receive task certification.  (T-1). 3.3.3.  Once lead instructor certified, each Combat Arms instructor that performs instruction duties  will  receive  an  annual  evaluation  each  calendar  year  to  ensure  continued  quality  of instruction  and  training.    (T-1).    This  evaluation  occurs  randomly  within  60  days  of  the anniversary date of the previous annual evaluation or lead instructor evaluation if there was no  annual  evaluation.    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  does  not  notify  the  instructor  being evaluated  until  the  day  of  the  evaluation.    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  must  conduct  this annual evaluation on a different SA/LW each  year (evaluations cannot be on the same type SA/LW  for  consecutive  years).    (T-1).    This  evaluation  follows  the  same  requirements  as lead  instructor  evaluation.    In  addition  to  this  annual  evaluation,  additional  “No-Notice” evaluations  are  encouraged  throughout  the  year.    Lead  instructor  evaluations  should  not  be used as a substitute for annual evaluations, in the event the instructor requires certification on a new weapon system. 3.3.4.  Conducting  evaluations.    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  conducts  lead  instructor  and annual  evaluations.    NOTE:    At  large  Combat  Arms  organizations  with  multiple teams/crews,  the  Combat  Arms  organizational  commander  may  allow  the  highest-ranking Combat  Arms  member  of  the  team/crew  to  conduct  these  evaluations,  although  they  must meet  all  other  requirements.    The  individual’s  trainer  conducts  training  evaluations.    The immediate supervisor or someone higher in  the  chain  of  command  conducts  evaluations on the Combat Arms NCOIC when they perform lead instructor duties.  Instructors subordinate to  the  NCOIC  do  not  normally  conduct  official  evaluations  on  the  NCOIC;  however,  task certified lead instructors subordinate to the NCOIC may conduct official evaluations on the NCOIC  with  AFSFC/FGWL  approval  when  necessary  to  meet  mission  needs.    Other instructors  may  perform  informal  evaluations  on  any  instructor  to  provide  additional feedback on their performance.  Higher HQ Combat Arms officials may also accomplish lead instructor  and  “no  notice”  evaluations.    The  evaluator  critiques  each  instructor  evaluated.  The  evaluator  must  provide  feedback  within  2  workdays  following  the  evaluation.    (T-2).  The  instructor,  supervisor  and  evaluator  should  be  present  during  the  feedback  session.    If instructor performance was unsatisfactory, include the NCOIC in the feedback session. 3.3.5.  Remedial  Training.    Provide  additional  training  for  an  instructor  rated  unsatisfactory for any  area.  Give  a follow-up evaluation within 30 days (Air Reserve  Component [ARC] members  have  two  UTAs  to  meet  this  requirement).    Instructors  must  satisfactorily accomplish the follow-up evaluation before they are permitted to perform lead instructor or tower operator duties.      (T-1). 3.3.6.  If  an  instructor  receives  an  unsatisfactory  rating  on  both  formal  evaluation  and  the follow-up  evaluation,  the  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  will  make  a  recommendation  to  the commander  whether  the  individual  should  receive  further  training  or  have  their  instructor status (B-shred or SEI) revoked.  (T-2).  These individuals are not allowed to instruct classes or  perform  tower  operator  duties  until  the  commander  reaches  a  decision.    Ensure  the supervisor  completes  thorough  documentation  of  remedial  training  in  the  member’s  Air Force Training Record (AFTR).   40  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 3.4.  Weapons Maintenance Evaluations:  The Combat Arms NCOIC also needs to establish a system  to  ensure  initial  and  annual  weapons  maintenance  evaluations  are  conducted  on  their personnel  who  perform  SA/LW  inspections  and  maintenance.    These  evaluations  may  be conducted  during  actual  inspections.    Use  the  “GO/NO-GO”  scale  to  rate  each  item.    Combat Arms personnel must satisfactorily complete a weapons maintenance evaluation on each SA/LW before  being  task  certified  to  perform  inspections  or  maintenance  without  supervision.    (T-1).  The  individual’s  trainer  or  any  Combat  Arms  member  who  is  task  certified  to  perform maintenance on the SA/LW may conduct the evaluation. 3.4.1.  Use  the  weapons  maintenance  checklist  posted  on  the  USAF  Combat  Arms  AFNet, EIS  website  (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/).    (T-2).    Modifications  to  the checklist are not allowed without approval of HQ USAF/A4SX. 3.4.2.  Weapons maintenance evaluations include, but are not limited to,  accomplishing and identifying  procedures  for:  Evaluations  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  accomplishing  and identifying procedures for: 3.4.2.1.  Scheduling SA/LW inspections and maintenance. 3.4.2.2.  Use of TOs, proper sequence, required gauges, fixtures, tools, etc. 3.4.2.3.  Troubleshooting suspected SA/LW malfunctions. 3.4.2.4.  Function firing of repaired SA/LW, when applicable. 3.4.2.5.  Completing  required  documentation,  such  as  annotating  weapons  maintenance log,  SA/LW  parts  accountability  documents,  entering  AFTO  Form  105,  Inspection Maintenance Firing Data for Ground Weapons information into SFMIS and completing appropriate Department of Defense and local forms. 3.5.  Documentation  of  Evaluations:  Document  all  instructor  and  weapons  maintenance evaluation results on the individual’s AF Form 1098 in AFTR.  Combat Arms sections may use SFMIS to record and track when evaluations are accomplished.  The Combat Arms NCOIC must file completed evaluation forms in the Combat Arms section.  (T-3).  The completed evaluation forms may be printed or electronic.  Maintain completed evaluation checklists for one year from completion  date,  then  dispose  of  them  or  return  them  to  the  individual.    Retain  the  evaluation checklists  for  one  year  after  unsatisfactory  areas  are  upgraded  to  satisfactory.    Dispose  of completed evaluation checklists or return to the individual upon their reassignment or separation. 3.5.1.  Combat  Arms  evaluators  will  use  the  fillable  instructor  and  weapons  maintenance evaluation forms prepared by AFSFC/FGWL and posted on the USAF Combat Arms AFNet, EIS  website  (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/).    (T-2).    Modifications  to  the checklists  are  not  allowed  without  approval  from  HQ  USAF/A4SX.    In  Security  Forces squadrons,  the  unit  Standardization-Evaluation  section  will  track  Combat  Arms  instructor and  SA/LW  maintenance  evaluations  and  add  them  to  trend  analysis  reports  as  outlined  in AFI 36-2646, Security Forces Training and Standardization Evaluation Programs, for duty position evaluations.  (T-2). 3.5.2.  Establish  instructor  proficiency  folders  to  maintain  evaluations  for  senior  non-commissioned  officers  who  require  evaluations  but  do  not  require  an  AF  Form  623, Individual Training Record Folder. AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   41  3.6.  Firearms  Qualification:  The  NCOIC  is  responsible  for  SA/LW  qualification  training  of assigned  Combat  Arms  personnel. live-fire qualifications on all SA/LW and courses of fire  on which they  are lead instructor certified,  for which they perform lead instructor duties and for which they perform firing line official (block officer) duties.  (T-1).  They will also maintain qualification on any weapon for which they have an armed duty/UTC requirement.  (T-1). instructors  will  maintain   Combat  Arms 3.6.1.  Instructors  performing  Combat  Arms  duties  who  are  lead  instructor  certified  or  who qualify strictly to maintain instructional skills are not required to attend classroom training or participate in the semi-annual recurring training (classroom/performance evaluation) sessions for SA/LW with  this requirement.   If they qualify  solely for teaching certification, they are also  exempt  from  semi-annual  live-fire  qualification  for  weapons/courses  with  this requirement.  Additionally, Combat Arms instructors who qualify merely to provide training and  who  do  not  have  an  arming  requirement  with  a  weapon  are  not  required  to  complete sustainment training and are only required to qualify once per year, regardless of the course requirements.    NOTE:    If  tasked  for  in-garrison  arming  or  deployment,  Combat  Arms personnel must complete the entire course of fire for the applicable weapon and tasking/duty.  (T-1). 3.6.2.  Personnel  assigned  to  a  QFEBL  will  accomplish  task  certification  on  all  SA/LW designated  by  the  QFEBL  Mission  Capability  Statement  (MISCAP).    (T-1).    Training  for unique SA/LW not provided/available at home station and maintenance training certification can  be  accomplished  at  AETC  formal  schools  or  at  regional  training  centers.    Live  fire qualification  is  not  required  for  Combat  Arms  assigned  to  the  QFEBL  as  the  UTC  is designated  for  maintenance  support  and  not  training.    When  practical,  it  is  highly recommended  proficiency  ammunition  be  used  to  increase  instructor  SA/LW  skills  and knowledge of all SA/LW supported by the QFEBL. 3.7.  Combat  Arms  Proficiency  Training:  The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  will  establish  policies and  schedule  use  of  authorized  Combat  Arms  proficiency  ammunition  for  assigned  Combat Arms personnel (See AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1 and the GMAT.).  (T-2).  These policies should permit  and  encourage  assigned  Combat  Arms  personnel  to  gain  additional  firearm  proficiency and  become  a  more  skilled  instructor.    Proficiency  rounds  are  to  be  expended  throughout  the fiscal year.  Proficiency firing is conducted quarterly.  Instructors do not wait until the last month of  the  fiscal  year  to  expend  the  annual  allotment  authorized.    Combat  Arms  proficiency ammunition  is  authorized  for  Combat  Arms  proficiency  only.    Ensure  SA/LW  proficiency  and in-house training times for Combat Arms are included in monthly schedules. 3.8.  Safety and Health Training:  Combat Arms personnel will be trained to use all authorized equipment  and  know  the  potential  hazards  of  the  workplace,  review  occupational  safety  and health  guidance,  and  be  familiar  with  the  Material  Safety  Data  Sheets  (MSDS)  or  Safety  Data Sheets  (SDS)  for  all  hazardous  products  used  in  the  section.    (T-0).    Such  hazards  include exposure  to  noise,  airborne  lead,  cleaning  solvents,  various  chemicals  and  improper  range  or cleaning  room  ventilation.    The  squadron  training  section  ensures  all  Combat  Arms  personnel receive  periodic  training  in  ground/weapons  safety,  use  of  force,  and  self-aid/buddy  care.  Annotate  all  completed  training  as  directed  in  AFI  91-202,  AFI  36-2646  and  MAJCOM/local directives.   42  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 Chapter 4 FIREARMS TRAINING PROCEDURES AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT 4.1.  Purpose:  This chapter provides information to assist Combat Arms personnel in preparing for  classroom  and  range  activities.    Security  Forces  Combat  Arms  personnel  are  charged  with providing  the  Air  Force  with  trained  personnel  who  are  confident  and  capable  of  effectively employing Air Force SA/LW.  The significance of this responsibility cannot be overstated.  As such,  Combat  Arms  operations  are  to  be  executed  with  the  utmost  professionalism  and consciousness, with emphasis on continued improvement.  Weapons’ training requires individual mental  and  physical  skills.    Personnel  must  pass  all  course  objectives  by  demonstrating  their ability to safely employ and maintain the weapon(s) as well as effectively engage targets prior to being certified.  (T-1). 4.2.  Classroom Procedures:  Good classroom procedures enhance student learning.  Remove or reduce controllable distractions within the classroom.  Ensure all material is adequately covered; shortcuts  are  not  authorized.    Every  class  is  to  include  all  objectives  outlined  in  AFMAN  36-2227.    Ensure  assistance  is  provided  to  students  especially  those  having  difficulty  with  the material. 4.2.1.  Instruction  Procedures.    Instructors  may  only  use  Air  Force  approved  lesson  plans (approved  by  HQ  USAF/A4SX)  when  conducting  training.    They  will  make  sure  all information  in  the  lesson  plan  (both  left  and  right  columns  [if  preprinted  on  Air  Force approved lesson plan) is presented so students will acquire intended knowledge and skills.  It is the responsibility of Combat Arms instructors to ensure learning is achieved.  Additional information that does not conflict with Air Force policy or procedure and is approved by the Combat Arms NCOIC, above what is contained in the lesson plan, is highly encouraged. 4.2.2.  Breaks.    Provide  breaks  in  the  presentation  at  regular  intervals  (typically  every  50 minutes) to prevent “information overload.” 4.2.3.  Instructors need to ensure all necessary preparations are accomplished prior to starting the  class.    Failure  to  do  so  demonstrates  a  lack  of  professionalism  and  detracts  from  the learning process. 4.2.4.  Continually  evaluate  all  elements  and  materials  to  support  training  and  ensure effectiveness. 4.2.5.  Primary  Instructors  (PI).    The  lead  instructor  must  possess  either  a  Primary  AFSC (PAFSC)  3P051B,  be  a  task  certified  3P031B,  SEI  312  or  DoD  civilian  equivalent,  be qualified  on  the  weapon  and  course  of  fire  on  which  they  are  providing  training  and  be assigned to a Combat Arms duty position.  (T-1).  For OJT purposes, a 3P031B may perform as  lead  instructor  under  the  direct  supervision  of  a  3P051B,  SEI  312,  or  DoD  civilian equivalent until task certified. 4.2.6.  Tower operators must possess either a PAFSC of 3P051B, be a task certified 3P031B, SEI 312, or DoD civilian equivalent.  (T-1). 4.3.  Assistant  Instructors  (AI):  AIs perform  key  duties during SA/LW qualification training, to include safety, resource protection, and coaching trainees.  In the classroom, they augment the primary instructor during portions of training requiring physical handling of SA/LW and during AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   43  performance  evaluation  sessions.    They  assist  trainees  by  reinforcing  correct  techniques  and helping to promote a positive learning environment.  On the firing line, they help maintain a safe training environment for trainees and fellow instructors.  They are responsible for coaching and assisting  shooters  as  necessary  during  the  practice  phases  of  qualification  training.    Clear communication between the tower operator and firing line officials is key to effective firing line operations.  Table 4.1. outlines student to AI ratios for classroom and range activities. 4.3.1.  AIs  are  3P0X1B/SEI  312,  DoD  civilian  equivalent,  or  task  certified  Group  A personnel qualified on the weapon and course of fire for which they are providing training.  (T-1).  Group A personnel must have a 5-skill level and can only be used when insufficient numbers of Combat Arms personnel are assigned to the Combat Arms parent organization. 4.3.2.  As  a  standard,  firing  line  officials  (block  officers)  are  3P0X1B,  SEI  312  or  DoD civilian  equivalent  personnel.    However,  Group  A  personnel  with  a  5-skill  level,  task certified  on  firing  line  official  duties  by  the  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  and  qualified  on  the weapon  and  course  of  fire  may  perform  as  a  firing  line  official  for  rifle,  carbine,  handgun, shotgun,  and  sub-machine  gun  training.    Leadership  should  not  overuse  this  option  and should  not  allow  it  to  become  standard  practice.    The  preferred  method  is  to  use  Combat Arms  instructors  for  this  duty.    These  individuals  perform  a  critical  role  in  training  and coaching shooters and these skills take experience and significant time to develop. 4.3.2.1.  Combat  Arms  sections  will  develop  a  comprehensive  training  and  certification program  to  certify  individuals  as  firing  line  officials.    (T-1).    At  a  minimum,  Combat Arms will include weapon safety, range safety, role of the tower operator, role of firing line officials, range operations, range commands, course of fire requirements/procedures, firing  line  official  duties/responsibilities,  coaching  techniques,  firing  line  evaluation techniques,  shooter  errors,  target  analysis,  and  emergency  notification  procedures  in firing line official training/certification.  (T-2).  This certification must include evaluation during  live-fire.    (T-2).    The  Combat  Arms  organizational  commander  will  approve  all firing line official training plans.  (T-3).  NOTE:  AFSFC/FGWL maintains a Firing Line Official the  USAF  Combat  Arms  AFNet,  EIS  website (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/) that units should use to develop local lesson plans for this training. lesson  plan  on 4.3.2.2.  Document task certification of firing line officials on AF Form 1098.  Maintain a locally developed training log of all personnel certified as firing line officials and indicate when their certification expires (refresher training is due) at the Combat Arms section. 4.3.2.3.  The  Combat  Arms  organizational  commander  and  the  member's  commander must approve firing line officials in writing.  (T-2).  Combat Arms will maintain a copy of approval letters at the Combat Arms section.  (T-2).  This certification is valid for one year  and  only  pertains  to  host  Combat  Arms  ranges  and  ranges  operated  by  the  host Combat  Arms  organization.    Personnel  must  complete  refresher  training  annually  to maintain  their  certification.    (T-1).    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  revokes  certifications  if individuals  fail  to  follow  established  guidance  or  if  they  perform  duties  in  an  unsafe manner. 4.3.2.4.  United  States  Air  Force  Academy  (USAFA)  cadets  may  perform  firing  line official  duties  during  Basic  Cadet  Training  on  the  M16A2  rifle  at  the  USAFA,  after   44  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 Combat Arms accomplishes all required training and certification for these individuals as outlined in paragraph 4.3.2.1. Table 4.1.  Minimum Instructor to Student Requirements/Ratios.  (T-1).    R U L E  With the exception of paragraph 4.3.3., one tower operator per firing line is required.  In addition, one firing line official per:  If the weapon is  Then one classroom AI per:  3 students during day automatic/burst phases, when students are using automatic or burst capable SA/LW, and during all night fire phases  7 students during all semi-automatic day fire phases. 1 student during any training involving shooter movement with loaded SA/LW (shoot, move, & communicate) Weapon  28 students (see notes) 14 students (see notes)  14 students (see notes)  Weapon  7 students  Weapon  7 students Weapon 1   Rifles, sub-machine guns, carbines, pistols, revolvers, shotguns 2   Grenade launchers and anti-armor weapons 3   Machine guns and automatic rifles  4   Heavy machine guns (e.g., M2/MK19)  5  Long Range Precision Rifles (e.g., M24/M107) NOTES:  A minimum of one AI is required for all classroom instruction.  If class size dictates a need for multiple AI’s, additional AIs are only required during the weapon performance/evaluation portions of the class.  The requirement for one firing line official per student during any training involving shooter movement with loaded SA/LW does not apply to shooter movement within the firing position, such as in the Rifle/Carbine Air Force Qualification Course (AFQC).   4.3.3.  During  live-fire  training  sessions,  Combat  Arms  may  supervise  up  to  three  students for  semi-automatic  day  fire  phases  for  SA/LW  specified  under  rule  1  in  Table  4.1.  without the  presence  of  a  tower  operator.    A  tower  operator  must  be  present  when  four  or  more students  are  on  the  line.    (T-1).    This  only  pertains  to  rifle,  pistol  and  shotgun  training programs.    Instructors  must  be  task  certified  AFSC  3P031B,  3P051B,  SEI  312  or  DoD civilian equivalent.  All other safety requirements apply.  When Combat Arms (B shred, SEI 312 or civilian equivalent) personnel are firing their own instructor qualification training or proficiency  ammunition,  the  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  may  establish  written  procedures  to AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   45  conduct  firing  of  up  to  six  Combat  Arms  personnel  using  only  a  tower  operator.    Line officials  are  required  for  Combat  Arms  Apprentice  Course  graduates  in  5-level  upgrade training until task certified on the weapon and course. 4.4.  Instructor Skill Level:  Certified instructors are responsible for the safety of all personnel participating  in  SA/LW  qualification  training.    Table  4.2.  outlines  instructor  skill  level requirements. Table 4.2.  Instructor Skill Level.

X  X NOTES:  Non-Combat Arms personnel may only perform firing line official duties for rifle, carbine, shotgun, and sub-machine gun training.  Non-Combat Arms personnel may not perform firing line official duties on other weapons such as, grenade launchers, anti-armor weapons, machine guns, automatic rifles and heavy machine guns.  For OJT purposes, a non-task certified 3P031B may perform as lead instructor and/or tower operator under the direct supervision of a task certified 3P051B, SEI 312 or DoD civilian equivalent until task certified. 4.5.  Weapons  Safety:  Combat  Arms  personnel  will  ensure  a  safe  SA/LW  handling environment at all times.  (T-1).  Refer to AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual, for additional guidance.  Note:  AFMAN 31-229 will be replaced with AFMAN 31-129, USAF Small Arms and Light Weapons Handling Procedures. 4.5.1.  Primary instructors are not permitted to have live ammunition while performing lead-instructor duties.  Only instructors performing resource protection duties are permitted to be armed  in  the  classroom  or  SA/LW  cleaning  area.    Combat  Arms  should  avoid  arming  AIs and if necessary due to limited manpower, AIs should be armed with a different type weapon than that being instructed.  Negligent discharge incidents can be avoided when sound safety precautions  are  observed.    Students  with  their  assigned  duty  weapon  or  bringing  a  non-Combat  Arms  weapon  to  training  will  clear  their  weapons  (no  live  ammunition  present) before  entering  the  classroom  and  Combat  Arms  instructors  will  verify  that  all  SA/LW  are cleared before allowing them in  the classroom.    (T-1).   Instructors will ask students  if they have live  ammunition,  dummy rounds, or blank  rounds on their person before allowing the   46  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 weapon  to  be  brought  into  classroom.    (T-1).    Other  than  rounds  carried  by  resource protection  personnel,  no  live  ammunition  is  ever  allowed  in  the  classroom.    Combat  Arms personnel  will  inspect  the  classroom  daily,  before  training,  to  ensure  there  is  no  live ammunition present.  (T-1). 4.5.2.  Use  only  authorized  dummy  ammunition  for  instructional  purposes.    Combat  Arms instructors  will  inspect  all  dummy  ammunition,  including  boxes/containers,  for  live  rounds before daily classroom use, including rounds in student desks or other locations.  (T-1). 4.5.3.  Combat  Arms  sections  should  maintain  two  sets  of  training  web  gear  for  rifle  and pistol classes.  Training gear used in the classroom should not be intermingled with the live-fire  gear  used  on  the  range.    Combat  Arms  officials  must  ensure  the  gear  is  purged  of  live ammunition  before  returning  the  gear  to  the  classroom  environment,  including  magazines and pouches.      (T-1). 4.5.4.  Trainees are to use their issued duty gear, providing no ammunition is introduced into the classroom.  Personnel completing SA/LW qualification training are encouraged to fire the applicable course(s) of fire wearing ICE every time they fire.  This is a requirement for pre-deployment  and  all  handgun  training  covered  in  Chapter  5.    Combat  Arms  personnel  will check all gear brought into the classroom to ensure no live rounds are present.  (T-1). 4.5.5.  In  addition  to  standard  loading  and  clearing  procedures,  Combat  Arms  will  provide instruction on clearing barrel procedures during classroom training for every weapon/course, using the procedures outlined in AFMAN 31-229.  (T-2). 4.6.  Lesson  Plans:  Maintain  a  hard  or  electronic  master  copy  of  all  AFSFC  approved  lesson plans  in  the  Combat  Arms  office  for  SA/LW  and/or  courses  where  training  is  provided.    The NCOIC  will  review/update  the  master  whenever  changes  (TO  or  Field  Manuals  [FM])  are required.    (T-1).    Instructors  will  maintain  their  own  updated  personalized  lesson  plans  to  use during  instruction.    (T-2).    A  personalized  lesson  plan  has  questions,  transitions,  examples, training aid correlation, personal notes and anything else necessary to assist or enhance training.  The NCOIC will certify each master and personalized lesson plan for accuracy by reviewing all lesson  plans  every  year  or  whenever  changes  (AFSFC,  TO,  or  FM)  occur.    (T-1).    Document proof  of  lesson  plan  review  on  a  form  letter,  general-purpose  worksheet  or  locally  developed lesson plan review form.  The NCOIC will place a  copy of the lesson plan review form in  the master and each personalized copy.  (T-3). 4.7.  Training  Aids:  Many  types  of  training  aids  (including  firearms  training  simulators)  are available  to  Combat  Arms  and  units.    Good  training  aids  and  techniques  can  shorten  the  time needed  for  teaching,  learning  and  proficiency.    Training  aids  stimulate  student  interest  and  get them  actively  involved.    Instructors  should  use  them  wisely  and  with  ingenuity.    The  Army Training  Command  and  most  Training  Support  Agencies  found  on  Army  installations  are possible  sources  for  firearms  related  training  aids.    Additionally  “Dry-  fire”  practice  is  an excellent method of reducing the cost of training. 4.8.  SA/LW  Cleaning  Procedures:  Students  must  clean  and  inspect  the  SA/LW  they  use  for training.    (T-1).    This  is  part  of  their  evaluation.    Combat  Arms  will  instruct  them  on  how  to properly maintain their firearm(s) IAW procedures and equipment listed in the operator manuals.  (T-1). AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   47  4.8.1.  Students completing qualification training are not to use cleaning tanks or unapproved methods to accomplish the preventive maintenance evaluation portion of training.  Personnel may  use  only  cleaning  solutions  and  lubricants  approved  in  the  applicable  SA/LW  TO.  Combat  Arms  must  ensure  all  use  of  solvents  and  chemicals  meets  Air  Force  and  local environmental requirements and is approved according to AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Material Management,  as well as  ensuring safe handling procedures and appropriate implementation of ventilation requirements.  (T-0). 4.8.2.  Combat Arms will not permit personnel to use unauthorized cleaners/solvents, such as automotive cleaners, degreasers or unauthorized equipment/procedures.  (T-1). 4.8.3.  Brief  students  about  any  safety  precautions  contained  in  the  MSDS/SDS  and  inform them  of  the  location  of  the  MSDS/SDS  for  the  type  of  solvent  or  lubricant  used.    The MSDS/SDS need to be available to students upon request. 4.8.4.  Do  not  allow  eating,  drinking  or  tobacco  use  in  the  cleaning  area.    This  reduces  the chances of ingestion of transferred lead/heavy-metals residue or splattered cleaning solvents during cleaning operations.  At a minimum, brief students to wash their hands with soap and water before eating, drinking or smoking (including smokeless tobacco). 4.9.  Student  Evaluations:  Instructors  will  evaluate  students  on  SA/LW  safety,  the  course  of fire, all required operator skills, preventive maintenance and function check of the firearm IAW the TOs and the qualification course guidance.  (T-1).  If an individual fails any evaluation in the training  program,  the  individual  is  unqualified  with  the  weapon  until  able  to  pass  the  failed portions  of  the  evaluation(s).    Reasons  for  failure  are  entered  on  the  AF  Form  522,  USAF Ground  Weapons  Training  Data,  in  SFMIS.    Students  need  to  perform  all  tasks  without assistance to pass evaluations. 4.10.  Student Critique:  Provide students the opportunity to accomplish a written critique of all phases of their training.  The primary instructor informs students of this program at the beginning of  training  and  ensures  student  critique  forms  are  made  available.    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC reviews critiques and provides requested answers to any concerns noted. 4.11.  Documentation  of  Training:  Proper  documentation  is  necessary  to  ensure  accurate ammunition  accountability  and  proof  of  firearm  qualification.    The  Combat  Arms  section  will use SFMIS to document all firearms training.  (T-1).  If SFMIS is offline, all entries are made in ink or typed electronically on the most current Information Management Tool (IMT) versions of AF  Form  710  and  AF  Form  522.    Combat  Arms  enters  the  data  from  manually  completed documents  into  SFMIS  when  it  becomes  available,  not  to  exceed  one  duty  day  from  when  the system is back online.  The example forms provided in this instruction are the SFMIS versions.  The  IMT versions  are almost identical  and will  be completed using the  same  guidance.  When AF Forms 710 and 522 information are entered into SFMIS, printed copies of these forms are not required  and  the  Combat  Arms  lead  instructor  verifies  the  accuracy  of  the  information  before closing out the class.  Combat Arms ensures that units/agencies that require printed copies of the AF Form 522 are provided access to SFMIS to produce the form. 4.11.1.  AF  Form  710  is  a  class  roster,  record  of  individual  qualification,  ammunition expenditure, range utilization and firearm use.  Complete the form  according to  Figure 4.1. and Figure 4.2.  Students will initial next to their printed name after training is completed and the  rounds  used,  score,  and  status  blocks  are  completed  (not  required  for  SFMIS  version).    48  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 (T-1).    The  lead  instructor  will  sign  in  the  “Certificate  of  Expenditures”  block  after  all students  have  initialed  and  ammunition  expenditures  are  finalized.    (T-1).    In  SFMIS,  the lead  instructor  verifies  that  all  information  is  entered  for  the  class  and  that  it  is  accurate before closing out  the class.    If  copies of the form  are needed after closing out  the class in SFMIS,  enter  “//SIGNED//”  in  this  block.    This  form  is  not  to  be  used  as  a  SA/LW  issue roster/hand  receipt.    File  manually  completed  (IMT)  AF  Forms  710  in  the  Combat  Arms office as the primary record of ammunition expended and training conducted. 4.11.2.  Use AF Form  522 to  document training.  If a hard copy is  desired, the individual’s unit may print the form  and maintain it to  provide a record of training, use as a scheduling aid or provide a crosscheck of qualification training.  Organizations use SFMIS for validation of  qualification,  previous  training  or  pre-deployment  training.    A  completed  SFMIS,  AF Form  710,  AF  Form  522,  or  manually  completed  (IMT)  version  signed  by  Combat  Arms (3P0XlB,  SEI  312,  DoD  civilian  equivalent),  are  the  only  allowable  source  documents  for current  or  past  qualifications.    Complete  AF  Form  522  according  to  Figure  4.3.    The  form may be initiated during the first period of training.  Annotate rounds fired, score, status, and both  student’s  and  range  official’s  signatures  (student  and  range  official  signatures  only required on manually prepared form) after completion of training.  Instructors do not sign the SFMIS  generated  version  of  the  form,  as  the  system  enters  “SFMIS  Authenticated”  in  the signature block.  Combat Arms personnel also annotate if the student qualified wearing ICE (pre-deployment  training)  and/or  the  types  of  holsters  and  other  equipment  the  student  is qualified to use in the remarks section using the drop down menu in the equipment section of SFMIS or manually adding items not in the drop down menu.  The AF Form 522 reflects the qualification status, type of firearm, date of qualification, and if appropriate, the individual's qualification for the award of the Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon (SAEMR). 4.11.2.1.  Combat  Arms  enters  the  course  of  fire  from  SFMIS,  using  the  standardized courses only, for qualification courses  and will  not  use locally  developed course of fire descriptions.    If  units  need  additional  qualification  courses  added,  they  contact AFSFC/FGWL and request them to be included in SFMIS.  Locally developed/modified courses for qualification training are not authorized. 4.11.2.2.  Combat Arms will annotate any variances from the published course of fire in the remarks section of the AF Form 522 in SFMIS and cite the authority for the variance.  (T-1).    For  example,  if  Headquarters  AF,  AFIMSC,  AFSFC  or  the  installation  has approved any deviations, such as not firing the gas mask portion of the course, Combat Arms  will  indicate  that  these  tables/phases/orders  of  the  course  were  not  fired  and provide a reference for the deviation.       (T-1).  An example would be, “Member did not fire  Phase  VI:  CWDE  Firing  Techniques,  of  the  Rifle/Carbine  AFQC  based  on  HQ USAF/A4SX deviation, 25 Sep 14.” 4.11.2.3.  For qualification training, Combat Arms will enter the total number of rounds fired by the student for the entire course and will only use one of the following statuses when  completing  firing  records  in  SFMIS:  “Q”  -  qualified,  “E”  -  expert,  “UQ”  - unqualified, “N/A” - not applicable (student did not complete training).  (T-1). 4.11.3.  To  ensure  students  receive  the  appropriate  type  of  training  (initial,  recurring  or remedial), student training records are obtained from SFMIS or the student’s hard copy AF AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   49  Form  522.    If  the  student’s  status  cannot  be  determined,  they  qualify  under  initial  training guidelines. Figure 4.1.  AF Form 710, SFMIS Version (Page 1). NOTES:  Separate entries for multiple qualification phases are not required.  For multiple phases, enter the total number of rounds fired, score as “---,” and status as qualified “Q” or un-qualified “UQ.”  If the individual does not meet minimum qualification standards, indicate in the    50  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 remarks section what phase(s) the shooter failed.  Combat Arms uses only the standardized courses from SFMIS and does not use any locally developed courses.    Figure 4.2.  AF Form 710, SFMIS Version (Page 2).  NOTES:  Use the “remarks” section to explain any unusual annotations, mistakes or information that should be captured such as, why students did not fire the prescribed amount of ammunition, e.g., “student #2 fired 3 additional rounds to confirm zero.”   AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   51  Figure 4.3.  AF Form 522, SFMIS Version. NOTES: Combat Arms uses only the standardized courses from SFMIS and does not use any locally developed courses.  Combat Arms annotates any variances from the published course of fire in the remarks section of the AF Form 522 in SFMIS and cites the authority for the variance.  Separate entries for multiple qualification phases are not required.  For multiple phases, enter the total number of rounds fired, score as N/A, and status as "Q" or "UQ."  If the individual is    52  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 unqualified, indicate in the “remarks” section what phases the shooter failed.  This form may be used for multiple SA/LW qualifications.  Combat Arms is to annotate if the shooter qualified wearing ICE for pre-deployment and what holsters the individual is qualified to use in the remarks section.  (T-1).    AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   53  Chapter 5 WEAPONS TRAINING 5.1.  Purpose:  This  chapter  defines  policy  and  procedures  for  the  execution  of  the  Air  Force SA/LW  training  program.    Only  task  certified  Combat  Arms  personnel  (3P0X1B,  SEI  312  or DoD  civilian  equivalent)  or  others  identified  in  this  instruction  are  authorized  to  conduct  Air Force SA/LW qualification or orientation training programs.  Personnel who receive this training (based on mission need) may be military, DoD civilian or civilian contractors in support of Air Force  missions.    Weapon  qualification  requirements  are  based  upon  in-garrison/peacetime arming  requirements,  SA/LW  qualifications  required  by  certain  Air  Force  specialties,  and deployments  to  combat  zones/designated  hostile  fire  areas.    The  Air  Force  does  not  conduct SA/LW familiarization training. 5.2.  General  Requirements:  Completion  of  SA/LW  qualification  training  does  not  authorize an individual to be armed.  Qualification training is only one step in the process commanders use to  authorize  arming  of  their  assigned  personnel.    Commanders  follow  the  guidance  of  AFI  31-117 to ensure personnel meet all suitability and additional requirements before allowing them to be  scheduled  for  any  SA/LW  training.    Qualification  training  culminates  in  an  evaluation  by certified  Combat  Arms  instructors  that  ensures  students  demonstrate  their  ability  to  safely  and effectively employ the weapon.  Commanders are responsible for ensuring their people meet all the requirements of AFI 31-117, as well as this AFI before allowing them to be armed or to have access to SA/LW. 5.2.1.  Air  Force  SA/LW  qualification  courses  listed  in  AFMAN  36-2227  provide  the minimum training and evaluation requirements necessary for Air Force members to employ individual and crew-served SA/LW. 5.2.2.  Due to resource limitations, non-mission essential SA/LW training is prohibited.  This includes activities such as, weapons demonstrations and allowing non-DoD personnel to fire Air  Force  SA/LW.    It  is  incumbent  on  the  requesting  unit  commander  to  ensure  only personnel  with  an  arming  requirement  attend  Combat  Arms  qualification  training.    Combat Arms  sections  need  to  establish  a  practice  of  coordinating  this  validation  with  unit schedulers. 5.2.3.  Personnel  who  report  for  weapons  training  may  not  complete  training  if  they  are unable  to  perform  all  physical  requirements,  to  include  assuming  all  firing  positions, unassisted.  Personnel are not permitted to cover their non-shooting eye with patches, cloth or other material to control eye dominance problems. 5.2.3.1.  Members  who  are  on  a  temporary  physical  profile  (e.g.,  wearing  a  cast  or  leg brace)  may  be  permitted  to  live-fire  if  their  injury  does  not  prevent  them  from  meeting course  objectives,  assuming  proper  firing  positions,  or  detracts  from  safe  weapons handling. 5.2.3.2.  If a pregnant member does not have live weapons firing or range duties excluded on an AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report, they are permitted to participate in these functions.   54  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 5.2.4.  If  live-fire  cannot  be  accomplished  the  same  day,  students  complete  qualification training  evaluations  (live-fire)  within  30  days  of  completion  of  mechanical  and  pre-marksmanship training (this also applies to remedial training). 5.2.5.  Assistant  machine  gunners  must  complete  the  same  training  program  and  meet  the same qualification standards as primary machine gunners.  (T-1). 5.2.6.  AFSFC/FGWL must approve all SA/LW training courses, such as those conducted at formal  training  courses  and  non-Security  Forces,  readiness  training  centers/expeditionary skills  training  courses  (e.g.,  Common  Battlefield  Airmen  Training,  Air  and  Space  Basic Course).       (T-1).  This does not include unit-level sustainment training courses, which the local  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  approves.    Additionally,  if  HQ  USAF/A4SX  approves  use  of other  Service  courses  for  qualification  of  Airmen,  AFSFC/FGWL  approves  the  courses (other  than  training  provided  as  outlined  in  paragraph  5.15.).    This  ensures  all  SA/LW training provided to Airmen is consistent, based on the same common skills/techniques and meets the minimum Air Force objectives.  Air Force personnel must be initially and currently qualified by Combat Arms as directed in this instruction on any SA/LW prior to participating in  any  other  SA/LW  training  courses  or  programs.    (T-1).    This  does  not  include  training provided by certified Combat Arms personnel, such as orientation courses. 5.2.7.  Unit  commanders  are  responsible  for  ensuring  all  their  unit  members  scheduled  for any type of SA/LW training are in compliance with the Gun Control Act of 1968 (18 USC § 922(d)(9)  and  (g)(9)/Lautenberg  Amendment),  as  outlined  in  AFI  31-117.    Combat  Arms personnel do not verify compliance or complete required documentation in regard to the Gun Control Act, as this is a unit responsibility and Combat Arms personnel cannot determine the status of individuals concerning this act. 5.2.8.  Combat Arms  personnel  will provide Use of Force and Rules of Engagement Basics training  during  all  qualification  training  classes.    (T-3).    This  training  does  not  replace  any other training requirements, does not meet use of force training required by AFI 31-117, and is specifically designed as additional training.  The goal is to provide students with a general understanding of Use of Force and Rules of Engagement guidelines as well as the differences between the two.  This training is for familiarization only and students will not be evaluated on  comprehension. the  slide  presentation  approved  by AFSFC/FGWL  and  available  on the  USAF  Combat  Arms,  AFNet,  EIS  website (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/) to conduct this training.  (T-1).   Combat  Arms  will  use 5.2.9.  Combat  Arms  personnel  will  also  provide individual  SA/LW accountability and security requirements during all qualification training classes.  (T-2).  This training  ensures  all  personnel  are  aware  of  their  responsibilities  to  properly  safeguard  Air Force SA/LW.  Combat Arms will use the slide presentation approved by AFSFC/FGWL and available on the USAF Combat Arms AFNet, EIS website to conduct this training.  (T-1). training  on 5.3.  Individual Equipment Requirements: 5.3.1.  The  AFSFC  maintains  the  USAF  Authorized  Small  Arms  and  Light  Weapons (SA/LW)  Accessories  listing  on  the  USAF  Combat  Arms  AFNet,  EIS  website.    The accessories included in this listing are the only items authorized for use on Air Force SA/LW.  For  information  on  items  included  in  the  listing  or  for  guidance  on  requesting  items  to  be added to the listing, contact AFSFC/FGWL. AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   55  5.3.2.  The USAF Authorized Small Arms and Light Weapons (SA/LW) Accessories listing includes the holsters approved for use within the Air Force.  Airmen will only train, qualify and  use  a  unit  issued  holster  from  the  list,  whether  the  holster  is  part  of  their  field  gear  or concealed  wear.    When  unit  commanders  authorize  individuals  to  use  more  than  one  type holster from the approved listing (concealed carry, shoulder holster, etc.), Combat Arms uses the  procedures  in  the  next  paragraph  to  qualify  them.    Document  qualification  and  holster type(s)  in  the  remarks  section  of  the  AF  Form  522.    Individuals  will  live  fire  with  their primary holster, unless prohibited in the next paragraph.  (T-1).  Exception:  HQ AFOSI/XR directs  holster  types  for  AFOSI  personnel  for  operational  use;  however,  AFOSI  personnel use  holsters  from  the  USAF  Authorized  Small  Arms  and  Light  Weapons  (SA/LW) Accessories listing when completing Air Force qualification training. 5.3.3.  When  commanders  authorize  the  use  of  a  concealed  carry  holster,  from  the  USAF Authorized  SA/LW  Accessories  listing,  Combat  Arms  uses  the  following  procedures  to certify individuals to use them.  Other than the exceptions in this paragraph, individuals will not  complete  live-fire  using  shoulder,  cross  draw,  or  concealed  holsters  (drawing  from  the concealed carry).  Combat Arms will include a combination of classroom and range dry-fire training  on  the  proper  techniques  for  drawing  the  weapon  from  these  type  holsters  (all personnel  will  be  performance  tested  on  their  ability  to  safely  and  correctly  draw  from  a cross draw/concealed holster).  (T-1).  Combat Arms has individuals practice drawing in the classroom  and  satisfactorily  complete  performance  evaluations  on  the  range,  without ammunition  in  the  weapon.    Once  this  training  has  been  completed,  personnel  use  the standard  belt  and  holster  or  their  primary  holster  (if  not  shoulder  or  cross  draw)  if  using multiple holsters, to qualify on the appropriate course of fire.  If an individual is authorized multiple holsters, Combat Arms will use this classroom, dry-fire, and performance evaluation method to certify them on each type holster.  Exception:  AFOSI agents and Security Forces investigators utilize their standard concealed duty holster and are authorized to live-fire using a  cross  draw/concealed  weapon  on  the  firing  line.    Combat  Arms  is  authorized  to  live  fire using  a  cross  draw/concealed  weapon  only  while  qualifying  on  the  AFOSI  courses  of  fire.  Personnel  reporting  for  Combat  Arms  training  who  are  authorized  concealed  carry  must present  documentation  from  the  authorizing  official  to  Combat  Arms  personnel  to  receive concealed  carry  training  (a  properly  completed  and  current  AF  Form  523,  USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, indicating concealed carry meets this requirement).  (T-2). 5.3.4.  Deploying personnel qualify wearing the ICE they will use at their deployed location.  As  a  minimum,  ICE  must  include  helmet,  individual  body  armor  (IBA),  load  bearing apparatus,  magazine  pouches  (if  not  incorporated  in  a  vest),  holster/  magazine  pouches  for the  handgun  if  applicable  and  protective  (gas)  mask.    Deployed  commanders  may  require other unique ICE to be worn during firing, with approval from the Combat Arms NCOIC to ensure  range  safety  is  not  compromised.    Logistics  Readiness  Squadron/Unit  and  Security Forces  Squadron/Combat  Arms  organizational  commanders  will  develop  a  process  that accommodates  one  stop  for  shooters  to  comply  with  equipping  and  training  requirements.  (T-3). 5.3.5.  All  individuals  will  bring  a  protective  (gas)  mask  and  documentation  that  they  are certified  IAW  AFI  10-2501,  AF  Emergency  Management  (EM)  Program  Planning  and Operations,  to  SA/LW  qualification  training,  when  a  protective  mask  is  required  in  the   56  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 course of fire.  (T-2).  Combat Arms sections do not maintain these items and they are issued through the installation readiness section. 5.4.  Weapon Qualification: 5.4.1.  Due to various limitations such as munitions and facilities it is necessary to divide the Air Force population requiring SA/LW training into groups based on their arming potential.  DoDD 5210.56 and AFI 31-117 identify the minimum  training requirements  and frequency of  qualification  training  needed  to  arm  personnel.    These  guidelines  govern  peacetime/in-garrison  arming  and  specifically  state  requirements  do  not  apply  to  contingencies  and designated  hostile  fire  zones.    Air  Force  SA/LW  qualifications  do  not  expire  during deployments  to  combat  zones  or  designated  hostile  fire  areas,  regardless  of  the  length  of deployment, providing qualification training was successfully completed as required by this instruction. 5.4.2.  Computer  based  training  (CBT)  modules  for  the  M16  rifle  and  M9  pistol  may  be available on the  AETC  Advanced Distributed  Learning System website  and individuals are encouraged to complete these courses prior to attending Combat Arms qualification training.  Commander’s and unit training personnel may also use this training to augment qualification training and as part of unit sustainment training programs. 5.4.3.  Mechanical SA/LW training is a highly effective way to increase SA/LW familiarity and should be accomplished at unit level by personnel qualified on the weapon.  AFMAN 10-100,  Airman’s  Manual,  also  contains  a  weapon  skills  section  that  unit  NCOs  can  use  to provide unit level training to their personnel. 5.5.  Arming  Groups  and  Qualification  Frequencies:  Air  Force  Career  Field  Managers (AFCFM) and Air Staff functional area directors establish overarching arming requirements for their  personnel,  which  include  arming  groups,  weapon  types,  any  specialized  training.    If  an AFCFM wishes to change the arming group of personnel under their functional area, they must coordinate  their  request  with  HQ  USAF/A4SX  for  approval.    All  Air  Force  personnel  are categorized  into  the  following  arming  groups.    If  an  individual  changes  arming  groups  from Group  B  to  Group  A,  they  must  meet  all  Group  A  requirements  in  the  qualification  training program before being armed.  (T-1).  All qualifications expire on the last day of the month. 5.5.1.  Air  Force  personnel  who  are  armed  to  perform  their  in-garrison  duties  or  as  a requirement  of  their  PAFSC  are  Group  A.    As  an  example,  this  group  includes  Security Forces, Security Forces augmenters, AFOSI agents, CE personnel (directed by their AFCFM) and Battlefield Airmen AFSCs.  Battlefield Airmen AFSCs include Combat Rescue Officers (13DXA), Special Tactics Officers (13DXB), Pararescue Airmen (1T2X1), Combat Control Airmen  (1C2X1),  Tactical  Air  Control  Personnel  (1C4X1),  Special  Operations  Weather Team  Airmen  (1W0X1)/Officers  (15WX),  Battlefield  Weather  Airmen  (1W0X1)/Officers (15WX) and Air Liaison Officers (13LXX).  AFSFC/FGWL maintains a listing of Group A career  fields,  functions,  agencies,  and  those  requiring  unit  live-fire  sustainment  training  on the  USAF  Combat  Arms  AFNet,  EIS  web  site  (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/).  Group A personnel will complete SA/LW qualification training once every 12 months on all SA/LW  with  which  they  are  armed.    (T-0).    Training  consists  of  classroom  and  live-fire qualification.    Security  Forces,  Battlefield  Airmen  AFSCs  and  others  directed  by  their AFCFM are additionally required to complete mandatory unit live-fire sustainment training 5 to 7 months after completion of qualification training on their primary weapon(s).  Security AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   57  Forces  personnel  with  an  arming  requirement  with  the  carbine/rifle  complete  the  Security Forces  Shoot,  Move,  and  Communicate  (SMC)  Course  to  meet  this  requirement.    Unit sustainment  training is  at  the option of the AFCFM.   If a Group A individual who requires unit  live-fire  sustainment  training  fails  to  complete  this  training  before  the  first  day  of  the eighth  month after qualification, they may not  be armed with  their primary  weapon(s) until they  satisfactorily  complete  sustainment  training.    The  original  expiration  date  for  the qualification course does not change.  The individual does not fire the qualification course to have  their  arming  authority  reinstated;  they  only  have  to  complete  sustainment  training.    If the individual goes beyond the original qualification expiration date, they will be required to complete the qualification course to be authorized for arming.  (T-1). 5.5.1.1.  Security  Forces  and  Battlefield  Airmen  AFSCs  will  qualify  annually  using  the specialized  qualification  course  (rifle/carbine  and  handgun  as  applicable)  or  advanced tables/phases/orders of the AFQC.  (T-1).  Individuals who are only armed occasionally and  are  not  identified  by  their  AFCFM  are  exempt  from  completing  unit  sustainment training.    An  example  is  Security  Forces  augmenter  personnel.    Unless  otherwise identified  on  the  AFSFC/FGWL  listing,  these  individuals  qualify  annually  using  the AFQC  and  are  not  required  to  complete  advanced  phases/orders.    Qualifications  expire on  the  last  day  of  the  month,  12  months  from  the  date  of  qualification  (e.g.,  individual qualifies on 10 Mar 08, their expiration date will be 31 Mar 09). 5.5.1.2.  Exceptions  to  the  above  frequencies  are  personnel  who  qualify  as  Designated Marksman (DM), Advanced Designated Marksman (ADM), Sharpshooter or MK19 and M2 machine gun gunners and assistant gunners. 5.5.1.2.1.  Designated Marksman personnel will complete qualification training twice each  year,  as  directed  in  the  Rifle/Carbine  AFQC.    (T-1).    The  qualification expiration date will be the last day of the sixth month after initial qualification.  For example, a DM who qualifies on 10 Apr 14, will have an  expiration date of 31 Oct 14.    They  are  not  required  to  complete  academic  instruction  or  performance evaluation  for  the  second  qualification  training  event.    Additionally,  DM  personnel should  complete  unit  live-fire  sustainment  training  during  alternating  quarters (between qualification training). 5.5.1.2.2.  Advanced  Designated  Marksman  and  Sharpshooter  personnel  will  qualify twice  each  year  and  complete  mandatory  sustainment  training  twice  each  year, alternating between qualification and sustainment each calendar year (CY) quarter as directed in the USAF Sharpshooter AFQC and ADM AFQC.  (T-1).  For example, if the member completes initial qualification in Feb 14 (first quarter of CY) they must complete sustainment training by 30 Jun 14 (end of second quarter of CY).  The next CY  quarter  they  must  complete  recurring  qualification.    In  this  example,  they  are required  to  qualify  by  30  Sep  14.    This  cycle  continues,  alternating  between sustainment  training  and  recurring  qualification  each  CY  quarter.    This  quarterly cycle continues until an arming requirement no longer exists. 5.5.1.2.3.  Live-fire qualification on the M2 and MK19 machine guns is valid for 12 months.    Gunners  and  assistant  gunners  must  complete  mechanical  training  five  to seven  months  after  live-fire  training.    (T-1).    Gunners  who  fail  to  complete mechanical  training  before  the  first  day  of  the  eighth  month  after  qualification  may   58  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 not be armed with the weapon until they satisfactorily complete mechanical training.  The  original  expiration  date  for  the  qualification  course  does  not  change.    The individual  does  not  fire  the  qualification  course  to  have  their  arming  authority reinstated;  they  only  have  to  complete  mechanical  training.    If  the  individual  goes beyond  the  original  qualification  expiration  date,  they  are  required  to  complete  the qualification course to be authorized for arming.  At the 12-month point, individuals complete  the  full  course  again  including  live-fire.    Any  other  unique  qualification frequencies are identified in the applicable chapter of AFMAN 36-2227. 5.5.1.3.  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  mission the  Security Forces/Combat  Arms  organizational  commander,  the  primary  duty  weapon  for  all Security  Forces personnel  is  the M4 carbine.   Individuals  need to train  more frequently with the particular SA/LW type they routinely carry. requirements  or 5.5.1.4.  Credentialed  Security  Forces  investigators  are  assigned,  as  a  minimum,  the current  Security  Forces  service  pistol  as  their  primary  duty  weapon.    Security  Forces investigators  must  qualify  on  the  handgun  AFQC  with  standard  law  enforcement  issue gear before qualifying on any other handgun course.  (T-1).  They will then qualify on the AFOSI  Basic  Arms  Training  (BAT)  Course  using  the  approved  Security  Forces concealed carry holster.  (T-1).  Security Forces investigators must qualify on the AFOSI BAT  Course  prior  to  being  authorized  to  carry  a  concealed  firearm.    (T-1).    If  mission requirements  dictate  an  immediate  need  for  an  authorization  for  concealed  carry, investigators fire the AFOSI BAT Course prior to carrying the pistol concealed without regard to the previous AFQC qualification date.  Once they have completed initial AFOSI BAT Course qualification and with their commander’s approval, they continue to qualify using this course, in addition to the handgun AFQC, until they are no longer performing this duty.  When tasked to deploy, they qualify on the handgun AFQC. 5.5.1.5.  Graduates  of  the  Security  Forces  Apprentice  Course  depart  school  qualified  on the pistol.  This qualification is valid for 12 months.  Graduates who arrive at their first permanent duty station during the sustainment training firing cycle should be scheduled to  fire the sustainment  course (carbine and/or pistol) with  their assigned  weapon before the  end  of  the  cycle.    Do  not  fire  personnel  out  of  cycle  to  meet  the  intent  of advanced/specialized programs. 5.5.1.6.  Security  Forces  Apprentice  Course  (SFAC)  and  Basic  Officer  Course  (BOC) students  complete the Rifle/Carbine AFQC, firing Table  I only  and not  including Phase VI, CWDE Firing Techniques.  This qualification is not valid for arming.  Commanders must  have  new  SFAC  and  BOC  accessions  complete  Tables  II  and  III  of  the Rifle/Carbine AFQC upon assignment and before arming them with the rifle/carbine.  (T-2).    The  SFAC  and  BOC  qualification  is  also  not  valid  for  deployment  and  individuals tasked to deploy must complete the entire training program (academic training and live-fire on Tables I – III) as outlined in the Rifle/Carbine AFQC course of fire guidance.  (T-1).  Additionally, SFAC and BOC qualifications are not valid for award of the AF Small Arms  Expert  Marksmanship  Ribbon,  regardless  of  the  score,  since  individuals  did  not complete the entire course. 5.5.1.7.  AFOSI  agents  will  qualify  annually  with  the  AFOSI  issue  handgun.    (T-1).  Agents  fire the AFOSI  BAT Course using the handgun AFQC objectives in  addition  to AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   59  the AFOSI BAT Course objectives.  Agents must fire the unit sustainment training course as specified in AFOSIMAN 71-113, Firearms, Use of Force and Apprehension Tactics.  (T-1). 5.5.1.7.1.  All AFOSI Regular Air Force (RegAF), reserve, and civilian special agents and  support  personnel  identified  to  deploy  qualify  on  a  specific  M16  series  weapon (M16A2 or M4 carbine).  NOTE: AFOSI support personnel are considered Group B. 5.5.1.7.2.  AFOSI agents are responsible for meeting other requirements as specified in AFOSIMAN 71-113. 5.5.1.7.3.  Changes  to  the  AFOSI  BAT  Course  and  special  weapons  courses  are authorized  when  approved  by  HQ  AFOSI,  Directorate  of  Strategic  Programs  and Requirements  (HQ  AFOSI/XR)  and the  United  States  Air  Force  Special Investigations Academy Commander (USAFSIA/CC).  Changes are to be coordinated with AFSFC/FGWL. 5.5.1.7.4.  Combat Arms  units with  range  and maintenance capability  are to  provide support  for  specialized/specific  AFOSI  SA/LW  and  courses  coordinated  and approved  by  AFSFC/FGWL.    AFOSI  is  to  make  any  specialized/specific  SA/LW available  to  Combat  Arms  to  conduct  instructor  training,  maintenance  training  and qualifications.  Combat Arms units not directly assigned to AFOSI are not authorized to  order  these  AFOSI  specialized/specific  SA/LW  for  this  purpose.    AFOSI  is  to provide  any  specialized/specific  targets  (not  already  used  for  normal  qualification courses) and any special equipment required for their courses. 5.5.1.7.5.  AFOSI agents reporting for weapon qualification may be in agent or casual civilian attire or military uniform for military agents. 5.5.1.7.6.  Joint  Drug  Enforcement  Teams  (J-DETs),  while  assigned  to  AFOSI, qualify on the  AFOSI  BAT Course.  J-DETs subject  to  recall by the security forces commander, or deployment on a core SF UTC, will maintain AFQC qualification on the  SF  service  pistol.    (T-1).    J-DETs  will  only  make  the  transition  to  the  M11  (or AFOSI handgun) if there is no possibility of recall to their Security Forces unit. 5.5.1.7.7.  Agents authorized by the AFOSI commander to a carry a privately owned pistol for duty use, as prescribed in AFOSIMAN 71-113, will qualify annually on the AFOSI BAT Course with the AFOSI government issued pistol (i.e., M11 pistol or its replacement)  as outlined in  this instruction.   (T-1).  Once qualified with the AFOSI issued  pistol,  agents  who  choose  to  carry  an  authorized  privately  owned  pistol  will complete the mandatory  live-fire sustainment training (i.e. proficiency firing) on the AFOSI BAT Course with the privately owned pistol before being authorized to carry the privately owned pistol on duty.  (T-1).  An AFOSI range safety officer trained and certified IAW this instruction will certify completion of live-fire sustainment training.  (T-1).  This training is documented within the AFOSI Learning Management System (LMS)  as  prescribed  by  AFOSIMAN  71-113.    Agents  will  complete  quarterly sustainment training with their chosen duty pistol as required by AFOSIMAN 71-113.  (T-1). 5.5.1.8.  Newly  assigned  Group  A  personnel  and  Group  A  personnel  with  individually assigned  SA/LW  (e.g.,  rifles/carbines/handguns  with  adjustable  sights)  replaced  or   60  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 having major repairs affecting the sight setting of the weapon (e.g., replaced barrel, upper receiver, sights) are to be provided the opportunity to zero their assigned weapon prior to being  armed with  it.  Combat Arms  forecasts for these munitions  IAW AFCAT 21-209 and  the  GMAT  and  ensures  the  range  and  needed  RSO  certified  unit  personnel  are available  to  conduct  this  operation.    If  live-fire  is  not  possible,  AFSFC/FGWL  may authorize the use of an approved boresighting device to accomplish zero of individually assigned  SA/LW.    However,  this  should  be  used  as  a  last  resort  when  live-fire  is impossible.    Security  Forces  personnel  will  not  be  armed  in-garrison  with  individual SA/LW, with adjustable sites, without completing weapon zeroing procedures as outlined above.  (T-1).  This is also highly recommended for deployed locations, at the discretion of the deployed commander. 5.5.1.9.  Aircrew members armed for air operations security (e.g., antihijacking) or other aircrew  arming  missions  are  classified  as  Group  A.    MAJCOMs  may  link  Group  A aircrew firearms qualification training to an aircrew ground training cycle program with a training frequency not to exceed 24 months.  Management of the aircrew ground training cycle  is  the  responsibility  of  the  aircrew  OPR.    Aircrew  SA/LW  qualifications  may  be linked  to  their  appropriate  airframe-specific  ground  cycle  training  program  identified  in the  applicable  AFI  11-2  series  aircrew  training  publication.    Combat  Arms  personnel enter an expiration date 24 months after the month of qualification on the AF Form 522 in SFMIS.  This option only applies to handgun qualification.  Aircrew personnel using this process may complete recurring qualification training during the 15th to 24th month after qualification.  If firearms training is not linked to an aircrew ground training cycle program,  the  standard  Group  A  qualification  length  of  12  months  applies.    These individuals qualify using the AFQC and they are not required to complete the advanced phases/orders of the course. 5.5.1.10.  All personnel assigned (including support personnel) to a Tactical Air Control Party (TACP), Air Support Operations Center (ASOC), or Control and Reporting Center (CRC) UTC may be classified as Group A, at the discretion of the unit commander and based on mission requirements.  If classified as Group A, these individuals must meet all Group  A  qualification  requirements,  including  unit  level  sustainment  training  if applicable.    (T-1).    Personnel  assigned  to  Combat  Camera  squadrons  are  classified  as Group A. 5.5.2.  Individuals/AFSCs  who  are  not  armed  in-garrison  or  identified  as  Group  A  and  are only armed for contingencies are Group B.  These individuals complete SA/LW qualification only  when  they  are  identified  by  name  by  their  commander  to  fill  a  deployment  tasking where  SA/LW  qualification  is  identified  as  a  requirement  on  the  deployment  tasking (actually deploying, not merely subject to deployment).  Group B individuals must qualify on the  rifle/carbine  or  handgun  AFQC  and  any  other  SA/LW  identified  in  their  deployment tasking.    (T-1).    These  individuals  complete  qualification  training  as  outlined  in  paragraph 5.13. and sub-paragraphs.  Group B qualifications are valid for 12 months or the length of the deployment, whichever is longer.  If required to qualify for reasons other than a contingency deployment,  such  as  overseas  assignment  or  non-contingency  deployment,  Group  B qualifications are valid for 12 months.  Qualifications expire on the last day of the month, 12 months from the date of qualification (e.g., individual qualifies on 10 Mar 14, their expiration date will be 31 Mar 15). AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   61  5.5.3.  Staff personnel assigned at the Group level and above, who would normally maintain firearms  qualification  by  virtue  of  their  AFSC,  are  not  required  to  maintain  firearms qualification  unless  designated  for  armed  duty  or  deployment  tasking.    However,  the  staff agency director may establish qualification training requirements. 5.6.  Firearms Training Programs:  The Air Force courses listed in AFMAN 36-2227 provide the minimum training and evaluation necessary for Air Force members to employ individual and crew-served  SA/LW.    Unless  specified  in  the  course  of  fire,  individuals  must  complete  all academic training, as well as successfully complete all tables/phases/orders of the course of fire, including  practice,  to  meet  the  minimum  requirements  for  qualification.    (T-1).    Should  an individual  initially  fail  to  meet  standards,  the  person’s  unit  determines  if  the  person  will  be rescheduled  for  remedial  training  or  if  the  person’s  arming  requirement  is  revoked.    Combat Arms  may  provide  same  day  refire  attempt(s)  on  the  evaluation  portion  the  individual  failed, resources permitting (this is not considered remedial training).  Combat Arms will immediately schedule Group A personnel who fail any second attempt of the evaluation portion for remedial training.  (T-3).  The Combat Arms section will notify the appropriate commander of the option of  granting  a  30-day  qualification  extension  IAW  paragraph  5.10.3.  of  this  AFI.    (T-2).  Instructors  may  determine  the  number  of  zero  or  practice  rounds  (if  any)  to  expend  before  the student attempts to qualify. 5.6.1.  Personnel  are  not  authorized  to  fire  government  procured  ammunition,  including COTS procured items, using privately owned weapons.  Personnel are not authorized to fire non-government  procured  (privately  owned)  ammunition  using  government  SA/LW.    The Air Force procures ground ammunition to support specific military training and operational missions.    Additionally,  Air  Force  ground  munitions  must  meet  specific  performance  and quality control requirements to ensure they will function safely in military SA/LW.  Civilian ammunition may not meet these requirements and their use could result in injury or death to Air Force personnel or damage to government equipment.  Exception:  When authorized as outlined in DoDD 5210.56, AFOSI personnel may use government procured ammunition in authorized privately owned weapons when performing official duties. 5.6.2.  If possible, individuals are to fire and qualify with the actual assigned military firearm with  which  they  are  or  will  be  armed.    Do  not  remove  firearms  from  extended  storage packaging solely to comply with this requirement, unless the individual is deploying with the weapon. 5.6.3.  Non-DoD  personnel  are  not  authorized  to  fire  government  SA/LW  or  ammunition.  This includes the prohibition of events such as firepower demonstrations, training of civilian community organizations or familiarization fire for any non-DoD personnel.   This  does not include  qualification  or  sustainment  training  of  personnel  contracted  by  the  Air  Force  who require qualification and arming as part of their contract. 5.6.4.  Where  applicable,  the  Air  Force  has  adopted  US  Army  Field  Manuals  as  instructor guides  and  references  for  most  SA/LW.    Combat  Arms  sections  use  them  as  a  guide  for conducting  the  training  programs.    However,  Air  Force  publications  and  policies  take precedence when there are conflicts in guidance or procedures. 5.6.5.  Do not mix initial or recurring students with remedial students in the same classes.   62  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 5.7.  Handgun  Orientation  Training:  Handgun  orientation  training  may  be  conducted  for USAFA Cadets and ROTC officer accessions.  This training consists of classroom instruction in general  firearms  safety,  basic  operation  and  marksmanship  fundamentals.    After  completion  of classroom training, students participate in a live-fire session by completing phase II (evaluation) of the handgun AFQC.  Trainees earn the SAEMR if they achieve an expert score.  This program does not qualify an individual for armed duty. 5.8.  Rifle  Orientation  Training:  Rifle  orientation  training  may  be  conducted  for  enlisted accessions  during  basic  military  training  and  USAFA  Cadets/ROTC  officer  accessions.    This training  consists  of  classroom  instruction  in  general  firearms  safety,  basic  operation  and marksmanship  fundamentals.    After  completion  of  classroom  training,  students  participate  in  a live-fire  session  as  outlined  in  the  Rifle/Carbine  AFQC.    Trainees  earn  the  SAEMR  if  they achieve an expert score.  This program does not qualify an individual for armed duty. 5.9.  Initial Firearms Live-Fire Qualification: 5.9.1.  Initial  SA/LW  training  is  completed  through  academic  and  live-fire  training  and qualification for individual, gunners and assistant gunners.  Initial full distance qualification is  mandatory  for  first  time  qualification  on  the  MK19  and  M2  machine  guns.    Initial  full distance  qualification  is  the  preferred  method  for  the  M240  machine  guns  and  the  M249 automatic  rifle.    AFSFC/FGWL  may  implement  M240  and  M249  initial  10-meter  (10m) qualification  when  the  one-way  travel  time  to  local  full  distance  ranges  is  more  than  two hours  or  when  local  full  distance  ranges  are  not  available,  or  their  use  is  cost  prohibitive.  The  Security  Forces/Combat  Arms  organizational  commander  will the MAJCOM/A4S when they are using initial 10-meter qualification.  (T-2). inform 5.9.2.  Initial  live-fire  qualification  is  detailed,  in-depth  training  designed  to  give  an individual the knowledge and skills necessary to meet qualification standards to be armed for a  specific  type  of  firearm.    The  firearms  program  evaluates  the  individual’s  marksmanship and  operator  skills.    Individuals  who  have  an  arming  requirement  (peacetime  or  wartime) must  satisfactorily  complete  the  appropriate  qualification  course  for  the  type  of  firearm(s) they  will  be  required  to  employ.    (T-1).    Officer  accessions  at  the    are  to  receive  initial handgun and rifle live-fire qualification.  Officer accessions at  are to receive initial handgun live fire qualification. 5.10.  Recurring Qualification Training:  Personnel required to maintain SA/LW qualification must  successfully  complete  qualification  training  at  the  frequency  specified  for  their  arming group  and  by  the  course  of  fire.    (T-1).    They  must  have  already  been  initially  qualified  (live-fire)  on  the  weapon.    (T-1).    Combat  Arms  can  verify  qualification  using  SFMIS  or  the individual’s  AF  Form  522.    Recurring  qualification  is  not  usually  as  detailed  as  initial  or remedial training and is used to counter proficiency and skill retention lost over time. 5.10.1.  Weapons  safety  procedures  and  the  training  objectives  (performance  tests)  in AFMAN  36-2227,  are  the  minimum  mandatory  items  required  for  Group  A  recurring training on the rifle, handgun and shotgun. 5.10.2.  A “training session” is defined as one trip to the classroom/range to receive SA/LW qualification  training.    “Re-fires”  are  defined  as  additional  attempts  during  a  qualification training session (occurs when a student fails to qualify).  If a student fails to qualify only one re-fire is permitted, then the student must be scheduled for remedial training.  (T-2). AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   63  5.10.3.  Unit  commanders  may  grant  a  30-day  qualification  extension  to  individuals  who were  qualified  at  the  time  they  reported  for  training,  but  failed  the  course.    This  extension cannot cause the individual’s qualification to exceed 12 months, or 24 months for Group A aircrew personnel when the MAJCOM has elected to link SA/LW qualification to an aircrew ground training cycle program.  Unit training sections will ensure qualification extensions are annotated  in  the  remarks  section  of  the  individual’s  printed  AF  Form  522  and  provide  the Combat Arms organizational commander with a courtesy copy of the extension letter.  (T-1).  Since  this  extension  can  only  be  granted  by  the  individual’s  current  commander,  it  is  not transferable if the individual changes units and does not require entry into SFMIS.  This 30-day extension gives commanders some flexibility in meeting home station peacetime arming requirements.    This  option  does  not  permit  personnel  to  deploy  to  high  threat  areas.    If  a person  fails  to  qualify  after  the  second  attempt,  the  person  is  considered  unqualified  at  the time of the second failure and they are not authorized an extension.  NOTE:  This provision is  not  automatic.    It  can  only  be  administered  on  a  case-by-case  basis  with  the  written approval of each individual’s unit commander/designated official. 5.10.4.  Individuals who fail to meet a specific qualification training standard during multiple phase  courses  may  continue  to  fire  the  entire  course  before  receiving  an  on  the  spot  re-fire attempt on the phase they failed.  Group re-fire attempts may be administered after the entire course  is  fired  or  anytime  between  phases.    However,  accurate  ammunition  expenditures need to be included on the AF Form 710. 5.11.  Remedial  Firearms  Training:  This to  emphasize  shooting fundamentals.  Remedial training sessions are kept small, or individualized, to focus on specific problems and afford the trainee an opportunity to improve. in-depth is training 5.11.1.  Instructors  may remedial zeroing/teaching  phases.    Conduct  ball  and  dummy  exercises,  similar  drills  or  simulator training, as needed, before evaluation. issue  additional  ammunition for  use  during 5.11.2.  Students are permitted one re-fire during the remedial training session(s), if they fail on the second attempt; schedule them for a second and final remedial class. 5.11.3.  If a student  fails to  qualify  and has been scheduled  for remedial  training, the firing line  official  will  prepare  a  written  assessment  of  the  shooter’s  problems.    (T-3).    This evaluation  assists  future  instructors  to  focus  efforts  on  the  problems.    Maintain  the assessment until the next scheduled remedial training class. 5.11.4.  If the student fails to qualify after the final remedial class, the Combat Arms NCOIC will  provide  the  individual’s  unit  commander  a  written  summary  of  probable  causes  of  the failures.    (T-3).    If  the  commander  determines  the  individual’s  duties  require  arming  and recommends  the  individual  for  additional  training,  the  student  will  attend  a  remedial  class with no more than two attempts at qualifying.  (T-2). 5.11.5.  The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  should  provide  a  progress  report  to  the  commander  for review after each training session. 5.11.6.  If the member still fails to qualify after additional training, the commander needs to make  a  determination  regarding  the  individual’s  suitability  for  armed  duty  or  contingency deployment.  NOTE:  As long as the individual continues to have an arming requirement and meets  all  other  suitability  requirements,  the  commander  may  continue  to  send  them  to   64  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 remedial  training.    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  will  provide  progress  reports  to  the individual’s  commander  after  each  failure  and  the  commander  must  recommend  additional training after each failure.    (T-3).  There is no limit to the number of remedial classes. 5.12.  Overseas Firearms Qualification Information: 5.12.1.  Some  Air  Force  personnel  require  SA/LW  qualification  training  for  assignment  to overseas  areas.    A  Personnel  Processing  Code  (PPC)  identifies  if  an  assignment  requires individuals to be SA/LW qualified.  Personnel with questions about PPCs or overseas firing requirements should contact their local Military Personnel Section (MPS), Military Personnel Flight (MPF) or gaining command for guidance on this personnel action.  The Combat Arms section  only  provides  SA/LW  qualification  training  not  interpretation  of  the  codes  or justification.    For  unique  situations,  refer  to  AFI  31-117  for  qualification  extensions.  Personnel  being  reassigned  from  overseas  areas  to  bases  in  the  continental  United  States (CONUS)  do  not  require  SA/LW  qualification.    They  receive  qualification  training,  if required, at their gaining base. 5.12.2.  MAJCOM   identified  individuals  from  either  arming  group  with  overseas assignments normally receive either rifle/carbine qualification training (enlisted) or handgun qualification training (officer) unless function or mission dictate otherwise.  The goal is for these individuals to meet live-fire qualification training standards.  However, if an individual fails  to  qualify  after  three  attempts,  the  losing  MPS/MPF  should  contact  the  gaining command for guidance. 5.12.3.  When  an  assignment  has  a  PPC  assigned  requiring  an  individual  to  be  small  arms qualified,  the  MPS/MPF  personnel  relocation  element  notifies  the  individual’s  unit  by identifying  the  requirement  in  the  relocation  notification.    As  with  other  small  arms qualification training, the individual schedules training with Combat Arms through their unit.  If  training  is  not  entered  in  SFMIS,  the  individual  or  the  individual’s  unit  ensures  the  AF Form(s)  522  is  provided  to  the  MPS/MPF  for  transfer  to  the  new  assignment.    During  in-processing, the gaining MPS/MPF ensures the AF Form(s) 522 is given to the member’s new unit.  See the MPS/MPF for further guidance. 5.12.4.  When identified by a PPC code, Air Force personnel receive firearms training before departing for an overseas assignment.  While assigned overseas, individuals receive recurring firearms  training  according  to  established  training  policies.    Personnel  requesting  SA/LW qualification  training  for  a  PCS  need  to  provide  proof  of  the  impending  assignment  along with their out-processing worksheet. 5.13.  Pre-Deployment  Firearms  Qualification  Training  Requirements:  This  section provides  guidance  on  the  minimum  firearms  qualification  training  required  for  Air  Force personnel  deploying  to  a  contingency  operation.    For  deployment,  individuals  complete  all tables/phases/orders as required in the course of fire without deviation or waiver for the required weapon(s).  Home station waivers may not apply without approval from the combatant command (CCMD).  NOTE:  The CCMD may also impose requirements that are more stringent and unit deployment  managers  need  to  verify  reporting  instructions  to  ensure  their  personnel  receive required training within the specified time. 5.13.1.  All personnel identified by name by their commander to fill a deployment tasking to a combat zone in time of war or a designated hostile fire area (actually deploying, not merely AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   65  subject  to  deployment)  will  complete  live-fire  qualification  training  on  all  individual  (e.g., rifle,  carbine,  handgun,  grenade  launcher,  shotgun,  submachine  gun,  automatic  rifle)  and crew-served  (e.g.,  light,  medium  and  heavy  machine  guns)  SA/LW,  identified  for  the deployment.    Group  B  personnel  will  complete  this  training  within  120  days  (180  days  for crew-served  SA/LW)  of  the  date  they  final  out-process  their  home  station  for  deployment.  (T-1).    This  qualification  will  be  valid  for  12  months  or  the  entire  duration  of  the deployment,  regardless  of  length.    The  SA/LW  training  requirement  is  identified  on  the individual’s deployment orders.  Students present a deployment tasking letter signed by their unit commander when reporting for training. 5.13.2.  Due  to  more  frequent  and  advanced  training,  Group  A  personnel  who  have successfully completed live-fire qualification training, wearing ICE, within 180 days (for all type  SA/LW)  of  deployment  final  out-processing  are  considered  deployment  weapons qualified and do not require any additional qualification training.  This qualification is valid for 12 months or the entire duration of the deployment, regardless of length.  If they do not complete live-fire qualification with the weapon they will take on the deployment, they must complete live-fire zero with the weapon and sights/optics they will take on the deployment, prior to leaving home station.  (T-1). 5.13.3.  Air Force personnel permanently assigned to sister service installations and directly supporting  joint  service  missions  who  are  authorized  to  use  sister  service  firearms qualifications as outlined in paragraph 5.15. may use this qualification for pre-deployment if accomplished within the required time.  The qualification is entered into SFMIS as outlined in paragraph 5.15. 5.13.4.  Short Notice Deployments: 5.13.4.1.  Unit commanders with arming group B personnel assigned to a unit type code (UTC)  with  a  designed  operational  capability  (DOC)  statement  requiring  a  72-hour  or less response time, or units with a Joint Mission Tasking/Charter, may designate up to 10 percent  of  their  unit  group  B  personnel  to  receive  annual  pre-deployment  qualification training.    If  the  wing  commander  deems  this  quantity  insufficient,  they  may  request approval  of  a  higher  percentage  from  their  applicable  MAJCOM  functional  three-digit office,  with  concurrence  of to  ensure supportability. the  MAJCOM/A4S  and  AFSFC/FGWL 5.13.4.2.  When arming group A or B individuals must respond to a tasking in 30 days or less (from notification date) and Combat Arms is unable to conduct qualification training within  the  required  time,  these  individuals  may  deploy  as  long  as  their  current  pre-deployment  qualification  has  not  exceeded  12  months.    Unit  training  officials  must document  that  the  short-notice  prevented  Combat  Arms  from  providing  training  on  the individual’s AF Form 522.  (T-1).  The CCMD may impose requirements that are more stringent  and  unit  deployment  managers  need  to  verify  reporting  instructions  to  ensure their  personnel  receive  required  training  within  the  specified  time  or  that  CCMD requirements are otherwise met. 5.13.4.3.  When the actual required response time for a deployment allows Combat Arms to  provide  qualification  training,  these  individuals  must  complete  pre-deployment qualification  within  the  timelines  outlined  in  paragraph  5.13.1.  and  5.13.2.    (T-1).    The goal  is  for  all  required  personnel  to  complete  pre-deployment  qualification  within  the   66  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 times outlined in these paragraphs; however, this provides commanders with a method to prepare for short-notice deployments. 5.13.5.  If  the  deployment  departure  is  delayed,  for  any  reason,  the  individual  will  remain deployment qualified. 5.13.6.  Group  A  individuals  whose  SA/LW  qualifications  were  current  prior  to  departure from  home  station  for  deployment  will  remain  qualified  for  30  days  upon  return  to  home station regardless if their original expiration dates, not to exceed a total qualification length of 14 months.  Group A individuals are exempt from unit live-fire sustainment training while deployed.    Personnel  armed  with  the  MK19  and  M2  machine  guns  are  exempt  from  six-month  mechanical  recurring  training  while  deployed.    Additionally,  DM,  ADM  and Sharpshooter personnel are exempt from semi-annual qualification and sustainment training requirements  while  deployed  and  their  qualifications  remain  valid  for  the  entire  length  of deployment. 5.13.7.  Individuals  must  perform  all  reloading  portions  in  the  course  of  fire  using  the magazine  pouches  or  vest  they  expect  to  use  when  deployed.    (T-1).    Commanders  may require  other  unique  ICE  to  be  worn  during  firing,  with  approval  from  the  Combat  Arms NCOIC  to  ensure  range  safety  is  not  compromised.    For  ranges  where  helmets  cannot  be worn during live-fire due to hearing protection requirements, Combat Arms will perform dry-fire  training  with  students  wearing  helmets  in  the  classroom  and  on  the  range  and  conduct performance evaluations to ensure proficiency.  (T-1).  These individuals then complete live-fire without the helmet. 5.13.8.  This  policy  applies  to  all  individuals  with  an  arming  requirement  at  the  deployed location, whether they take SA/LW or have them issued in theater. 5.13.9.  Aircrew personnel  who will not  perform  any  ground combat  duties at  the deployed location  or  use  ICE  are  exempt  from  this  requirement.    If  they  have  an  aircrew  arming requirement, their live-fire qualification has to be current before deployment departure.  This provision only applies to handgun qualification. 5.13.10.  Individuals  who  regularly  deploy  to  hostile  fire  areas  multiple  times  during  a  12-month period are not required to complete qualification training prior to each deployment.  If the  individual  has  completed  live-fire  qualification  wearing  ICE  during  the  previous  12-month period and they deploy again, after returning to their home station, they are considered deployment qualified.  Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring their personnel do not abuse  this  policy  by  using  it  as  a  way  to  circumvent  the  intent  of  ensuring  Airmen  are prepared for combat. 5.13.11.  Units/bases  unable  to  comply  with  these  requirements  contact  AFSFC/FGWL  for guidance on alternate methods of accomplishing the training.  The AFSFC coordinates with HQ USAF/A4SX to facilitate action to meet this requirement. 5.13.12.  There are locations with pre-positioned SA/LW and firing the actual weapon before the deployment is not feasible.  In these cases, if possible, the installation/site commander at the  deployed  location  should  make  allowances  for  conducting  zero  firing  soon  after  the deployed  personnel  arrive.    Combat  Arms  personnel  make  provisions  for  individuals deploying  with  a  SA/LW  from  extended  storage  to  zero  their  weapon  if  they  are  already qualified  or  if  their  weapon  has  been  changed  for  some  reason.    Group  A  personnel  must AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   67  complete live-fire zero with the SA/LW and sights (optics) they will take on the deployment, prior  to  leaving  home  station  if  they  used  a  different  weapon  to  complete  qualification training.  (T-1). 5.14.  Virtual Training Systems (VTS):  Virtual Training Systems (VTS) or firearm simulators are  efficient  and  time  effective  tools  to  provide  real  world  training  at  the  unit  level  in  the following  areas:  use  of  force,  theater  or  command  specific  rules  of  engagement,  tactical  and judgmental  scenarios.    VTS  are  very  good  for  initial  through  advance  marksmanship  and remedial  training.    Personnel  are  encouraged  to  utilize  VTS  to  practice  marksmanship fundamentals prior to qualification training. 5.14.1.  Arming groups that do not fire on an annual basis are encouraged to use VTS. 5.14.2.  VTS firearm simulators should: 5.14.2.1.  Perform in all respects like the actual weapon.  The intent of the simulator is to allow realistic training to increase survival skills and to ensure instinctive reactions when needed. 5.14.2.2.  Have  adjustable noise  and recoil simulation  to  make the experience as  real  as possible. 5.14.2.3.  Make  the  student  use  the  same  physical  skills  and  actions  needed  to  fire  the actual weapon. 5.14.2.4.  Include a firing line that mimics a live-fire range firing line. 5.15.  Firearms  Qualifications  for  Air  Force  Personnel  Assigned  to  Other  Services:  Air Force personnel permanently assigned to sister service installations and directly supporting joint service missions, such as Tactical Air Control Party or Air Support Operations Center personnel, are  authorized  to  use  sister  service  approved  firearms  qualification  courses  conducted  by  host service  personnel  as  their  primary  method  of  accomplishing  qualification  training  during  their tour  of  duty.    Units  with  personnel  receiving  qualification  training  from  other  Services  must arrange to have their qualification data entered into SFMIS.  (T-2).  The Combat Arms section at the installation providing administrative support is responsible for updating SA/LW qualification data  submitted  by  the  unit.    This  ensures  a  record  of  qualification  is  visible  within  in  the  Air Force system. 5.15.1.  Other  Service  qualifications  cannot  be  used  to  arm  Air  Force  personnel  for  in-garrison  arming  missions  on  Air  Force  installations.    Members  who  are  reassigned  from  a sister  service  installation  to  an  Air  Force  installation  must  complete  Air  Force  firearms qualification training to remain qualified.  (T-1). 5.15.2.  Units  using  this  option  must  ensure  individuals  receive  Use  of  Force  and  Rules  of Engagement  Basics  training  during  qualification  training.    (T-3).    Unit  training  personnel may provide this training following the guidance in paragraph 5.2.8. 5.16.  Pre-Deployment  Qualification  Training  by  Other  Services:  In  short  notice  or unanticipated  circumstances,  Airmen  may  have  no  alternative  other  than  to  report  to  pre-deployment training  conducted by another Service or  agency  (e.g.,  US  Army Power Projection Platform)  without  prior  Air  Force  qualification.    This  is  an  exception  to  policy  and  only  used after all efforts to get the Airmen qualified by Air Force Combat Arms have been exhausted.   68  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 5.16.1.  When an Airman reports to pre-deployment training conducted by another Service or agency under such conditions, training and qualification by the host Service may be required.  Commanders  may  use  one  of  two  courses  of  action  to  offset  this  shortfall:  send  Air  Force Combat  Arms  personnel  to  the  training  location  to  qualify  Air  Force  members,  or  if  not feasible, request approval from AFSFC/FGWL to utilize host Service training, qualification courses and training personnel to qualify Air Force personnel. 5.16.2.  If leadership selects the second option above, qualification training must satisfy the training  objectives  for  the  appropriate  weapon(s)  as  listed  in  AFMAN  36-2227.    (T-1).  Additionally,  other  Service  qualifications  under  these  conditions  are  only  valid  for  the specific  mission  requiring  the  training  and  may  not  be  used  for  in-garrison  arming  of  Air Force personnel. 5.17.  Weapons  Training  by  other  than  Air  Force  Combat  Arms  Personnel:  Other  than individuals  addressed  in  paragraphs  5.15.  and  5.16.,  Air  Force  members  must  be  live-fire qualified by Air Force Combat Arms personnel before participating in any other live-fire SA/LW training including training provided by another Service, agency or contractor.  (T-1). 5.18.  Unit Live-Fire Proficiency/Sustainment Training:  This section describes an innovative concept  to  facilitate  increased  hands-on  SA/LW  training.    The  intent  is  to  permit  the  user  to create a SA/LW training program more in-line with their operational needs.  This effort does not replace  periodic  Air  Force  SA/LW  qualification  requirements  but  is  additional  training  to maintain perishable skills by affording personnel more live-fire time.  Only individuals who are currently qualified on the weapon may participate in the proficiency/sustainment program.  For this initiative to be effective Combat Arms sections need to be open-minded and creative without sacrificing safety.  Combat Arms needs to be responsive to the unique training requirements of other  specialties  and  able  to  identify  training  capabilities  within  the  restrictions  of  the  firing range.    Only  Combat  Arms  personnel  are  authorized  to  conduct  SA/LW  qualification  training, but  anyone  range  official  certified  by  the  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  can  conduct  proficiency  or sustainment training. 5.18.1.  Units with authorized proficiency munitions, per AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1 and the GMAT,  may  use  Air  Force  small  arms  ranges  to  conduct  their  proficiency/sustainment training  on  an  as-available  basis.    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC  will  establish  procedures  for scheduling and use of the firing range.  (T-1). 5.18.2.  Air  Force  specialties,  which  previously  maintained  semi-annual  and  quarterly SA/LW  qualification  requirements,  may  use  this  provision  to  supplement  their  annual qualification training. 5.18.3.  Units  who  are  authorized  proficiency/competition  ammunition  are  responsible  for managing  their  individual  ammunition  supply  accounts,  to  include  disposition  of  munitions residue.    Combat  Arms  is  not  required  to  provide  ammunition,  manpower  or  SA/LW  to conduct unit proficiency/competition training programs. 5.18.4.  Combat  Arms  sections  will  assist  units  with  development  of  their  SA/LW  training program.  (T-3). 5.18.5.  Before conducting live fire training, Combat Arms must approve courses/type of fire for each SA/LW used on their range to ensure range safety limitations are met.  (T-1). AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   69  5.18.6.  The  unit  training  section  can  establish  a  unit  level  proficiency  SA/LW  training program at the discretion of the unit commander IAW this instruction.  This program should focus  training  on  advanced  SA/LW  tactics,  techniques  and  procedures,  as  well  as  mission specific  training  needs.   This  program  should  also  be  progressive  in  nature  to  encourage  a continual improvement in SA/LW handling skills and tactics proficiency. 5.18.7.  Unit  commanders  are  also  encouraged  to  institute  a  SA/LW  training  program  that does  not  include  live-fire.    Unit  NCOs  who  are  qualified  on  the  SA/LW  being  trained  can provide  training  to  their  personnel  using  AFMAN  10-100,  Combat  Arms  lesson  plans  and instructor  guides  as  references.    Individuals  are  not  required  to  be  qualified  in  order  to participate in non-live-fire SA/LW training. 5.18.8.  Individuals who are range safety officer certified by the Combat Arms NCOIC may conduct unit live-fire sustainment training as outlined in paragraph 2.3.2.2. 5.19.  Firearms  Competitions/Courses:  Commanders  may  approve  the  use  of  government SA/LW  and  authorized  munitions  for  Air  Force  personnel  to  participate  in  military/civilian shooting  competitions  and  courses.    AFCAT  21-209,  Volume  1  and  the  GMAT  provides allowances  for  matches  conducted  as  outlined  in  AFI  34-227,  Excellence-In-Competition,  and other competitions. 5.20.

Personnel  who  live-fire  qualify  with  an  expert  score  on  the  handgun/rifle AFQC  (see  AFMAN  36-2227),  or  the  AFOSI  BAT  Course  and  meet  all  other  course objectives. 5.20.1.2.  Personnel  who  are  unable  to  fire  the  AFQC  but  achieve  an  expert  score (through live-fire) on another Service's qualification program such as the U.S. Army M16 rifle  qualification  course.    AFSFC/FGWL  must  pre-approve  this  course  for  Air  Force personnel and/or units physically assigned to another branch of the military.  (T-2). 5.20.1.3.  Personnel  who  live-fire  qualify  with  an  expert  score  on  the  rifle  or  handgun orientation training and meet all other course objectives identified in paragraphs 5.7. and 5.8. of this instruction. 5.20.2.  The AF  Form 522 is  the basis for the SAEMR award.   The individual awarded the SAEMR  is  responsible  for  bringing  the  AF  Form  522  to  the  MPS/MPF  Awards  and Decorations  section.    The  MPS/MPF  enters  the  award  on  the  individual's  automated personnel record. 5.20.3.  AFI 36-2803, Individual and Unit Awards and Decorations, prescribes authority for the  award  of  this  ribbon.    AFI  36-2903,  Dress  and  Personal  Appearance  of  Air  Force Personnel, shows proper wear of the SAEMR. 5.20.4.  One  Bronze  Service  Star  can  be  awarded  in  addition  to  the  SAEMR  when  an individual qualifies as expert with both the rifle and a handgun.  Only one award per weapon type (rifle or handgun) is made no matter how many times the individual qualifies as expert. 5.20.5.  Individuals  may  not  fire  any  Air  Force  qualification  courses  or  other  service’s qualification programs, for the sole purpose of obtaining the expert ribbon.   70  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 5.21.  Non-Lethal  Munitions  Qualification  with  Firearms:  Personnel  identified by their unit commander  to  be  armed  with  non-lethal  munitions  must  initially  qualify  on  the  AFQC  or specialized  course  as  applicable;  then  fire  the  non-lethal  course,  phases  or  orders  outlined  in AFMAN  36-2227.    (T-1).    Non-lethal  qualification  training  is  documented  as  a  separate qualification in SFMIS and on the individual’s AF Form 522 and expires on the weapon’s AFQC expiration date.  Combat Arms personnel are not required to be qualified as non-lethal instructors in order to train on non-lethal munitions. 5.22.  Blank Fire, Close Combat Mission Capability Kit (CCMCK) Fire and Exercises:  Air Force  personnel  participating  in  training  with  blank  ammunition  or  CCMCK  (marking cartridges)  such  as  field  exercises,  force  on  force  training,  military  working  dog  teams,  and honor  guard  are  not  considered  armed  as  defined  by  AFI  31-117.    Therefore,  they  are  not required to maintain firearms qualification strictly for these events.  Individual units will provide their own training to emphasize safe handling, weapon operation, use of blank ammunition and operator  maintenance  as  directed  in  AFMAN  31-229.    (T-1).    This  training  should  be documented  on  AF  Form  1098  or  AF  Form  797.    Additionally,  units/personnel  will  follow  the guidance  in  the  AFSFC  Close  Combat  Mission  Capability  Kit  (CCMCK)  Training  Concept  of Operations (CONOPS) when planning/conducting CCMCK training.  (T-1).  This publication is available on the USAF Combat Arms AFNet, EIS web site (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/). 5.22.1.  Bird/wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program.   Combat Arms  should assist unit trainers in  OJT task certifying their personnel.   These personnel  are  not  certified to  go “solo” until, they have completed training as outlined in the approved local BASH plan. 5.22.2.  Individuals  who  carry  the  weapon  with  ammunition,  other  than marking  cartridges, that  fires  any  type  of  projectile  (including  shot)  must  complete  the  appropriate  complete qualification  course  before  carrying  the  weapon  with  this  type  ammunition.    (T-0).    This includes personnel performing duties such as BASH or Pest Control, when they are equipped with this type ammunition. 5.23.  Deviations: 5.23.1.  Deviations  from  program  or  facility  criteria  are  categorized  as  permanent  or temporary. 5.23.1.1.  A  permanent  deviation  is  given  when  a  condition  makes  it  impossible  to comply with program or facility criteria or a training objective, and it is impossible or too expensive to correct the condition.  The deviation cannot create an unsafe situation. 5.23.1.2.  A  temporary  deviation  is  for  a  correctable  condition  temporarily  making  it impossible to comply with program or facility criteria or a training objective. 5.23.2.  The  Security  Forces/Combat  Arms  organizational  commander  submits  deviation requests  to  the  appropriate  approval  authority  for  all  facility  and  equipment  limitations preventing  full  compliance  with  or  accomplishment  of  program  or  facility  criteria.    The request for deviation needs to address the following: 5.23.2.1.  Specify the reasons why a deviation is needed. 5.23.2.2.  Explain what is being done to lessen the impact and meet criteria. 5.23.2.3.  Include plans to correct the situation. AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   71  5.24.  General Exceptions: 5.24.1.  Individuals  stationed in  countries or  areas within a  country where customs, laws or international  agreements make it impossible to  receive firearms training  are not required to have  firearms  training  for  the  duration  of  the  assignment,  not  to  exceed  24  months.    This provision  does  not  preclude  MAJCOMs  from  maintaining  qualification  intervals  at established TDY locations.  NOTE:  Individual SA/LW qualifications must be current prior to being granted this 24-month exception.  (T-1).  This 24-month exception is the total length of  qualification  and  no  extensions  may  be  granted  (individuals  cannot  be  qualified  longer than 24 months). 5.24.2.  Students  attending  technical  training  courses  at    are  exempt  from  firing  SA/LW phases/orders  requiring  chemical  warfare  protective  equipment  (i.e.,  gas  mask  and  gloves).  Although not  required, students may fire these phases/orders upon  arrival  at  their first  duty station.  Individuals must fire these phases/orders before deployment.   (T-1).  Guidance for SFAC and BOC graduates is outlined in paragraph 5.5.1.6. 5.24.3.  HQ  AFOSI  manages  use  of  Federal  Law  Enforcement  Training  Center  (FLETC) certified  instructors  and  task  certified  AFOSI  agents  to  ensure  sufficient  numbers  of personnel  to  support  the  USAFSIA  firearms  training  program.    The  following  paragraphs apply only to training conducted at the USAFSIA. 5.24.3.1.  When  insufficient  numbers  of  Combat  Arms  or  civilian  equivalent  personnel are  not  available,  USAFSIA/CC  may  authorize  FLETC  firearms  instructors  at  the USAFSIA  who  have  successfully  completed  the  Firearms  Instructor  Training  Program and  Law  Enforcement  Instructor  Training  Program  to  perform  lead  instructor,  tower operator,  assistant  instructor,  and  firing  line  official  duties  for  Air  Force  qualification training  of  AFOSI  students/agents  at  the  USAFSIA  on  the  AFOSI  issue  handgun,  M16 series  rifle/carbine,  and  the  AFOSI  issue  shotgun.    FLETC  firearms  instructors  must successfully  complete  the  live-fire  qualification  course  before  conducting  training  and annually thereafter.   (T-1).  These personnel  need to  be trained and evaluated by  a task certified Combat Arms instructor whenever possible. 5.24.3.1.1.  FLETC  firearms  instructors  must  follow  the  guidance  in  this  instruction as  well  as  the  guidance  in  the  appropriate  chapter  of  AFMAN  36-2227  and/or AFOSIMAN  71-113  (for  the  AFOSI  BAT  Course)  while  conducting  Air  Force qualification  training.    (T-1).    FLETC  firearms  instructors  will  use  Air  Force approved lesson plans for this training.  (T-1). 5.24.3.1.2.  FLETC  firearms  instructors  that  meet  the  requirements  in  paragraph 5.24.3.1. may certify AFOSI agents  to  perform  assistant instructor and/or firing line official  duties  at  the  USAFSIA  following  the  guidance  in  paragraph  5.3.  and subparagraphs. 5.24.3.2.  If Air Force Combat Arms SA/LW maintenance support is unavailable (lack of assigned  Combat  Arms  personnel  or  not  reasonably  available  at  a  nearby  Air  Force installation),  USAFSIA/CC  may  approve  use  of  the  FLETC  Gunsmith  Shop  to  inspect and  repair  student/agent  Air  Force  SA/LW.    Weapons  are  inspected/repaired  IAW chapter  6  of  this  instruction  and  the  applicable  AFTO  for  the  SA/LW.    When  FLETC gunsmiths perform inspections or maintenance, they will provide a copy of the inspection   72  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 report  and/or  repair  documents  to  the  office  designated  by  USAFSIA/CC  for  entry  into SFMIS.    (T-2).    All  inspections  and  repairs  of  Air  Force  SA/LW  must  be  entered  into SFMIS on the weapon AFTO Form 105.  (T-1). 5.25.  General Deviations: 5.25.1.  Personnel  who  live-fire  qualify  on  one  type  of  shotgun  may  carry  another  shotgun type once they have successfully completed mechanical training and performance evaluations on the other shotgun conducted by Combat Arms.  Combat Arms will document mechanical training  as  a  separate  qualification  in  SFMIS  or  on  the  individual’s  AF  Form  522.    (T-1).  The qualification expires on the original AFQC live-fire expiration date. 5.25.2.  The  Combat  Arms  organizational  commander  may  approve  temporary  use  of qualified  Group  A  personnel  to  help  the  Combat  Arms  section  when  there  is  not  enough Combat  Arms  (3P0XlB,  SEI  312,  DoD  civilian  equivalent)  manpower  at  the  installation  to meet the workload.  These personnel may serve as assistant instructors or firing line officials only  as  outlined  in  paragraphs  4.3.1.  and  4.3.2.    This  option  only  applies  to  rifle/carbine, handgun and shotgun training. 5.26.  Installation-Level Deviations: 5.26.1.  Firearm qualification extensions authorized IAW AFI 31-117. 5.26.2.  Temporary facility criteria deviations.  When the installation is unable to construct or maintain  ranges  according  to  specified  criteria,  installation  commanders  may  approve  a temporary  deviation  not  to  exceed  12  months.    The  Combat  Arms  NCOIC,  in  coordination with  CE,  base  safety,  and  BE  develops  the  request  and  forwards  it  through  the  Security Forces/Combat Arms organizational commander to the installation commander.  Ensure the MAJCOM/A4S and AFSFC/FGWL receive a  courtesy  copy of the temporary deviation.   If the  deviation  cannot  be  resolved  within  12  months,  forward  the  deviation  request,  through installation channels, to AFSFC/FGWL and courtesy copy the MAJCOM/A4S. 5.27.  AFSFC Deviations:  The AFSFC can: 5.27.1.  Approve qualification extensions IAW AFI 31-117. 5.27.2.  AFSFC/FGWL may waive night fire familiarization/qualification training if the night fire course of fire cannot be fired as intended due to range limitations, mandatory quiet hours, etc.  This does not apply to pre-deployment qualification training and any deviations for this training must be coordinated with the CCMD and approved by AFSFC/FGWL. 5.27.3.  HQ USAF/A4SX approves all deviations to all courses of fire contained in AFMAN 36-2227, after review by AFSFC/FGWL. 5.27.4.  After  coordination  with  MAJCOM  and  AFIMSC  CE,  safety  and  BE  the MAJCOM/A4S  submits  small  arms  range/support  facility  deviation/waiver  requests  to AFSFC/FGWL  if  local  installation  deviations  cannot  be  resolved  within  12  months  or  a permanent  deviation  is  necessary.    Base  level  Security  Forces  units  coordinate  requests through  safety,  CE  and  other  base  agencies  responsible  for  facility  criteria.    Provide  a coordinated  copy  of  the  waiver  request  to  AFSFC/FGWL  for  approval  consideration  and coordination with AFCEC. AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   73  Chapter 6 WEAPONS MAINTENANCE, INSPECTION AND CONFIGURATION  6.1.  Purpose  and  Program  Overview:  This  chapter  provides  guidance  on  the  installation’s SA/LW inspection and maintenance program.  Base Combat Arms personnel are responsible for the  inspection  and  maintenance  of  all  military  SA/LW  assigned  to  the  installation  and  those required by an approved support agreement.  Conduct SA/LW inspections and repairs as outlined in  applicable  Air  Force  Technical  Orders  (TO),  Time  Compliance  Technical  Orders  (TCTO), Technical  Manuals  (TM) and applicable safety messages.  Combat Arms  will enter all SA/LW inspections  and  maintenance  on  the  AFTO  Form  105  in  SFMIS  for  each  SA/LW  inspected  or repaired.    (T-1).    For  SA/LW  with  existing,  hard  copy,  AFTO  Forms  105,  Combat  Arms transfers  the  information  from  the  paper  form  into  SFMIS  during  the  first  inspection  of  the weapon. 6.1.1.  Air Force SA/LW are to be repaired by tasked-certified Combat Arms personnel only.  Personnel  assigned  to  the  Air  Force  Gunsmith  Shop  may  perform  SA/LW  maintenance  (to depot-level)  and  test  fire  SA/LW  with  proper  training  and  certification.    Air  Force units/personnel are not authorized to contract or hire civilian gunsmiths or other non-Combat Arms personnel to repair, inspect, or modify Air Force SA/LW.  Modification of any kind to Air Force SA/LW is not authorized without approval from AFLCMC/EBRMW, Small Arms Program Office and AFSFC/FGWL.  This includes any changes to the weapon from the “As Issued” configuration.  The “As Issued” configuration is how the weapon is configured when issued to Air Force units as a new item.  When assigned to other  military installations, units are  to  receive  support  from  the  servicing  Air  Force  installation  Combat  Arms.    If  the servicing Air Force installation’s Combat Arms support is unavailable, AFSFC/FGWL may approve  use  of  other  Service  qualified  (Combat  Arms  equivalent)  personnel  to  inspect  and repair  Air  Force  SA/LW.    The  Small  Arms  Program  Office,  AFLCMC/EBRMW,  may approve  or  establish  repair  of  Air  Force  SA/LW  through  contracts  when  requested  by  the unit.    When  other  agencies  perform  inspections,  maintenance  or  modifications,  the  owning unit of the SA/LW will provide a copy of the inspection report and/or repair documents to the host  Combat  Arms  section.    (T-2).    The  host  Combat  Arms  section  will  enter  the  action performed on each SA/LW into SFMIS.  (T-1). 6.1.2.  Air Force TOs specify the Additional Authorization List (AAL) items and authorized munitions for each type of firearm. 6.1.2.1.  The ASC 538 and USAF Authorized Small Arms and Light Weapons (SA/LW) Accessories listing identify additional equipment items approved for use with Air Force firearms not identified in the applicable TOs. 6.1.2.2.  The  GMAT  on  the  Global  Ammunition  Control  Point  (GACP)  website (https://www.my.af.mil/ammoprod/wm/) authorizations approved for use by Air Force functional area. ammunition identifies 6.1.3.  Units  requesting  non-standard  commercially  purchased  items  (commercial  parts, services  and  accessories  [grips,  slings,  lights,  etc.]  and  ammunition),  not  specifically identified for use in applicable TOs, ASC 538, the USAF Authorized Small Arms and Light   74  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 Weapons Accessories listing or the GMAT, follow the guidance in the following paragraphs.  NOTE:  This does not apply to tools and fixtures used by Combat Arms for SA/LW repairs. 6.1.4.  On  a  case-by-case  basis,  non-Air  Force  military  and  commercial  weapons  parts, accessories and ammunition may be approved and procured for Air Force use.  The Air Force GACP  (AFLCMC/EBHM),  at  Hill  AFB  UT,  approves  procurement  of  non-Air  Force military and commercial ammunition requests and units must follow the guidance in AFI 21-201  and  AFI  91-205,  Nonnuclear  Munitions  Safety  Board,  for  the  request  and  approval  of COTS ammunition.  (T-1).  The Air Force Small Arms Program Office (AFLMC/EBRMW), at Robins AFB GA, approves procurement of commercial weapons parts and accessories and users  request  approval  for  these  items  from  this  agency.    Once  approved,  certified  Combat Arms  personnel  must  install  and  inspect  all  non-standard  commercially  purchased  items regardless of the owning organization.  (T-1).  The Air Force Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board (NNMSB) and the Air Force Small Arms Program Office (for use in the weapon) must approve  all  commercial  munitions  and  users  must  follow  the  guidance  in  AFI  91-205, Nonnuclear  Munitions  Safety  Board,  for  request  and  approval  of  these  items.    (T-1).    Air Force  units/agencies  procure  SA/LW,  accessories  and  ground  munitions  through  approved Air  Force  logistics  channels/processes  only.    Organizations  are  not  authorized  to  use government credit cards to purchase firearms or ammunition. 6.1.5.  Accessories and Associated Equipment:  Users or organizations are not authorized to obtain or use any SA/LW accessories or associated equipment that are not approved on the USAF Authorized Small Arms and Light Weapons (SA/LW) Accessories listing maintained on the USAF Combat Arms AFNet, EIS website (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/).  Most items on the listing are obtained through the Air Force supply system.  The Small Arms Program Office and AFSFC/FGWL do not normally allow the commercial purchase of any accessories  or  associated  equipment  for  SA/LW.    Units  must  request  approval  from  these agencies to commercially purchase any SA/LW accessories or associated equipment.   (T-1).  Examples  of  accessories  include;  scopes,  aiming  devices,  adapters,  mounts,  sights  and similar  items.    To  request  accessories  not  included  on  the  listing,  use  the  procedures  in paragraph 6.2.  Modified SA/LW parts also fall into this category.  Units/individuals are not authorized to procure or install commercial parts, either standard or modified, for Air Force SA/LW or to otherwise modify SA/LW in any manner.  Examples include; modified controls (e.g.,  triggers,  magazine  catch  buttons,  safeties,  selector  levers,  trigger  kits),  stocks, handguards, springs, magazines or similar items.  If a unit has a capability requirement for a modified part, use the procedures in paragraphs 6.1.4., 6.1.4.1., 6.1.4.2. or 6.2. to identify the capability gap and request/recommend a solution. 6.1.6.  Air  Force  Small  Arms  and  Associated  Equipment  Requirements,  Procurement, Modification  and  Improvement  Process:    A  solid  need  coupled  with  senior  leadership involvement  is  essential  when  establishing  a  requirement,  acquiring  a  new  weapon system/accessory or identifying a needed modification or improvement.  Needs or capability gaps should be identified by the MAJCOMs and pushed forward to the appropriate Air Staff functional agency so a coherent picture is presented when working acquisition strategies. 6.1.6.1.  If there is a need, requirement, capability gap or new mission, which cannot be supported  by  current  types,  amounts  and  capabilities  of  Air  Force  SA/LW,  associated equipment or munitions, unit commanders identify the need to their respective MAJCOM AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   75  or AFIMSC functional manager.  Use of functional area management will allow all needs to be checked and authenticated. 6.1.6.2.  The  MAJCOM  evaluates  the  shortfall  and/or  validates  the  need  following  the guidance  in  AFI  10-601,  Operational  Capability  Requirements  Development.    If  the MAJCOM  believes  a  new  weapon  or  improvement  to  an  existing  system  may  be required,  they  use  the  guidance  in  AFI  10-601  to  identify  the  need  and  initiate  the requirements process. 6.2.  SA/LW  Modifications:  For logistic support, SA/LW systems are categorized and defined as support equipment items.  As such, the modification of SA/LW systems is addressed in AFI 63-131, Modification Management.  A modification is defined as an alteration to a configuration item  (CI)  that,  as  a  minimum,  changes  the  form,  fit,  function  or  interface  of  the  item.    All modifications  to  SA/LW  systems,  whether  permanent  or  temporary,  must  be  approved  by  the Small Arms Program Office, and coordinated with AFSFC/FGWL.  (T-1).  Users/managers must request any proposed modifications to Air Force SA/LW following the guidance in AFI 63-131 and using AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal.  (T-1) 6.3.  Responsibilities: 6.3.1.

These SA/LW  may or may not  be inert (design  altered to prevent live-fire use) depending on the need to fire blank ammunition. 6.4.4.  Storage Definitions: 6.4.4.1.  In-Use:    Any  SA/LW  not  stored  and  packaged  according  to  applicable  Special Packaging  Instructions  (SPI)  as  outlined  on  https://spires.wpafb.af.mil/  are  considered in-use and fall under one of two sub-categories.  Regardless of the sub-category, they are still classified as in-use weapons. 6.4.4.1.1.  Active  In-Use:    An  active  weapon  is  a  weapon  issued  for  duty  within  a period of 90 days.  The weapon may or may not be assigned to an individual. 6.4.4.1.2.  Inactive In-Use:  An inactive weapon is a weapon that has been stored for a period of 90 days without use.  The weapon may or may not have been assigned to an individual. 6.4.4.2.  Extended  Storage/Preferred  Packaging:    Only  SA/LW  stored  and  packaged according  to  applicable  SPI  as  outlined  on  https://spires.wpafb.af.mil/  fall  into  this category.  All others are considered In-Use.  Weapons removed from special packaging become in-use until they are properly returned to storage following the applicable SPI. 6.5.  Levels of Firearms Maintenance: 6.5.1.  Depot  Maintenance.    Maintenance  on  SA/LW  beyond  base  level  Combat  Arms capabilities  (may  include  complete  rebuilding  of  parts,  assemblies  and  end  items).    This could include parts manufacture, parts and SA/LW modifications and testing, and parts and SA/LW reclamation.  Usually, depot maintenance is done in support of the Air Force supply system.    HQ  USAF/A4LR  has  depot  maintenance  policy  responsibility.    AFMC  and AFLCMC/EBRMW are supporting agencies.  Depot-level maintenance on Air Force SA/LW is usually done by other Services through contracts from Small Arms Program Office.  The Air  Force  Gunsmith  Shop  at  Joint  Base  San  Antonio-Lackland,  Texas,  has  limited  depot maintenance capability. 6.5.2.  Field  Maintenance (Organizational,  Direct  Support,  and  General  Support).  Inspections and maintenance authorized for and accomplished by Combat Arms personnel in direct  support  of  using  organizations.    This  includes  all  inspection  and  maintenance  of SA/LW assigned to the installation and governed by support agreements.  This maintenance is  limited  to  the  repair  of  end  items  or  unserviceable  assemblies  in  support  of  using organizations.    Combat  Arms  personnel  must  ensure  all  SA/LW  parts  are  properly  secured when  not  in  use.    (T-1).    These  inspections  and  maintenance  procedures  are  very detailed/technical  processes,  requiring  special  training  and  equipment  to  be  properly performed.    Owners  of  unique  SA/LW  systems  are  responsible  for  providing  funding  to AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   77  through supply or depot required channels gauges/tools/parts procure for inspection/repair/replacement by Combat Arms.  Unique SA/LW are defined as those that are not  standard  Air  Force  service  weapons  and  that  are  not  supportable  with  technical  data, cataloged parts, inspection gauges or other maintenance support.  Examples of standard Air Force  service  weapons  include  M9,  M11  and  GLOCK  19  pistols,  M16A2  rifles  and  M4 carbines.    An  example  of  unique  weapons  would  be  some  sub-machine  guns  purchased  by AFOSI  in  the  past  as  COTS  items  that  do  not  have  any  Air  Force  maintenance  support.  Combat  Arms  will  ensure  PMEL  inspections  are  performed  on  gauges  procured  for  these SA/LW.    (T-1).    Weapon  parts  for  unique  SA/LW  not  used  for  base  or  personal  defense should  not  be  stocked.    Owning  units  of  unique  SA/LW  will  provide  funds  as  needed  to purchase  replacement  parts.    (T-3).    Installation  Combat  Arms  sections  are  authorized  to perform the following maintenance: 6.5.2.1.  Service Weapons (non-match grade).  Inspect and repair within applicable limits of the TO pertaining to the weapon.  Combat Arms are authorized to stock SA/LW spare parts  for  maintenance  levels  below  depot.    Every  Combat  Arms  member  is  responsible for practicing supply discipline.  Use historical data, maintenance records, and anticipated mission needs to assist in determining stock levels of SA/LW replacement parts.  Stock at least  one  of  any  item  at  the  Combat  Arms  weapons  repair  shop  when  a  known requirement  exists.  This  includes parts requiring infrequent  replacement.   Use the total number  of  "in  use"  and  packaged  SA/LW,  where  maintenance  support  is  provided,  to establish a spare parts inventory. 6.5.2.2.  Match  Grade  Weapons.    Combat  Arms  personnel  must  perform  inspections,  to include  gauging,  IAW  applicable  TOs  and  this  instruction.    (T-1).    For  inspection  and repair/replacement  of  specialized  or  fitted  parts  outside  the  scope  of  normal  Combat Arms sections, owning units are to refer these items to depot or the Air Force Gunsmith Shop  for  support  at  the  direction  of  the  item  manager.    Those  Air  Force  shooting  team members  with  SA/LW  needing  specialized inspection/repair  coordinate  with AFSVA/SVORF,  ATTN:  AF  Shooting,  2261  Hughes  Ave,  Suite  156,  JBSA  Lackland TX 8236-9854, DSN 969-7352 or commercial (210) 395-7352, for shipment of SA/LW.  The mailing address of the Gunsmith Shop is , Lackland   78236-5722.  All other requests for match grade specialized inspection/repair go through the Small Arms Program Office, AFLCMC/EBRMW. 6.5.2.3.  Ceremonial  Weapons.    Combat  Arms  personnel  must  perform  inspections,  to include  gauging,  IAW  applicable  TOs  and  this  instruction  on  all  ceremonial  SA/LW capable  of  firing  a  live  or  blank  ammunition  cartridge.    (T-1).    Additional  support  is limited to those inspections to ensure units are conducting proper operator maintenance, and replacement of broken or worn parts preventing the proper operation of the weapon, or  posing  a  safety  hazard.    Replacement  parts  for  some  of  these  non-service  model SA/LW  (e.g.,  M1  Garands,  1903  Springfields)  are  not  always  available  through  routine military  supply  channels.    The  owner/user  is  responsible  for  coordinating  maintenance outside  the  scope  of  local  Combat  Arms  sections  with  Small  Arms  Program  Office, AFLCMC/EBRMW.    Combat  Arms  is  not  required  to  inspect  non-firing  (inert) ceremonial weapons and the condition  and care of these SA/LW is the responsibility of the owning organization.   78  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 6.5.3.  Operator  Maintenance  (Individual).    This  is  SA/LW  maintenance  performed  by individuals and/or the assigned unit.  This maintenance is limited to authorized disassembly, assembly,  cleaning,  lubricating,  preserving,  tightening  some  screws,  adjusting  sights, replacing  slings,  spare  barrel  bags,  etc.,  and  performing  preventive  maintenance  checks according  to  applicable  TOs.    Using  organizations  will  not  order  or  bench  stock  SA/LW parts, as this is outside the scope of operator maintenance.  NOTE: Using organizations will not  procure  commercial  SA/LW  parts,  accessories  (grips,  slings,  holsters,  lights,  etc.)  other than  those  approved  for  COTS  purchase  on  the  USAF  Authorized  Small  Arms  and  Light Weapons (SA/LW) Accessories or approved as outlined in paragraph 6.1.3.  Combat Arms is the only organization authorized to procure SA/LW parts.  The base Combat Arms section is the  focal  point  for  all  authorized  SA/LW  parts  procurement  and  replacement.    Using organization  can  transfer  funds  to  the  Combat  Arms  account  so  Combat  Arms  can  control ordering  of  replacement  parts  for  service  weapons.    TO  references  to  "Organizational Maintenance," refer to Army maintenance levels.  In the Air Force, Combat Arms personnel perform this level of maintenance. 6.5.4.  Weapons  Cleaning.    Each  unit  possessing  firearms  is  responsible  for  their  own SA/LW  preventive  maintenance  (PM)  cleaning  and  lubrication  program  (to  include magazines,  spare  barrel  kits,  tripods,  etc.)    IAW  SA/LW  TOs  for  both  in-use  and  extended storage  SA/LW.    Combat  Arms  advises  unit  weapons  custodians  on  cleaning  frequency  if local conditions warrant more frequent cleaning.  As a minimum, owning units will perform preventive  maintenance  on  all  their  assigned  in-use  (whether  active  or  inactive)  SA/LW  to include  cleaning,  lubrication  and  operator  inspection,  immediately  after  firing  any  type  of ammunition  and  every  90  days,  whether  the  weapon  is  fired  or  not.    (T-2).    Combat  Arms sections  will  develop  a  weapon  custodian  handbook  listing  the  needed  cleaning  items  and general  information  needed  in  support  of  SA/LW.    (T-3).    This  handbook  also  outlines weapon  custodian  responsibilities  and  procedures  concerning  Combat  Arms  related requirements. 6.5.4.1.  Units are responsible for developing a standardized method of documenting their required  cleaning  and  PM.    Units  may  use  an  Air  Force  general  purpose  form  for documenting this cleaning.  The AFTO Form 105 is not used to document this cleaning.  Combat Arms training SA/LW are exempt from this requirement. preventive  maintenance 6.5.4.2.  Combat  Arms  will (cleaning/operator  inspection)  documentation  during  SA/LW  inspections  and  annotate findings on the weapon inspection report.  (T-1). unit  SA/LW review 6.5.4.3.  IAW each SA/LW Operator’s Manual, owning units are responsible for ensuring proper  cleaning  equipment/materials  are  available  for  each  assigned  weapon  to  include those in extended storage. 6.6.  Procedures  for  Maintenance  of  Unserviceable  Weapons:  Owning  agencies  will  take SA/LW needing repair and AFTO Form 105 (if not already in SFMIS) to the base Combat Arms section.  (T-3).  Combat Arms personnel inspect the weapon and determine if they can repair it or  if  depot  repair  is  needed.    If  Combat  Arms  is  to  retain  the  weapon  for  repair,  place  a Department  of  Defense  (DD)  Form  1577-2,  Unserviceable  (Repairable)  Tag,  on  the  weapon, until all repairs are made, and issue a receipt to the owning agency.  Notify the owning agency when the weapon is repaired.  If Combat Arms does not retain the weapon for repairs at the time AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   79  of  inspection,  ensure  coordination  with  the  owning  unit  to  complete  repairs  is  made.    Combat Arms will place a completed DD Form 1577-2 on SA/LW needing depot maintenance and return them to the owning organization for turn-in to Base Supply.  (T-1).  Combat Arms will maintain a permanent SA/LW maintenance log of all maintenance performed on SA/LW.  (T-1).  This log is  maintained  in  the  SA/LW  maintenance  shop  to  provide  a  historical  record  of  parts  used, maintenance performed, etc.  Record the maintenance action on the weapons AFTO Form 105 in SFMIS IAW TO 11W-1-10, Recording of Historical Data for Ground Weapons.  (T-1).  Combat Arms  will  transfer  all  existing  information  on  the  hard  copy  AFTO  Form  105  into  SFMIS.        (T-1).    Process  unserviceable  parts/scrap  material  for  turn-in  IAW  local  supply  or  DRMO procedures.    If  DRMO  or  local  supply  is  unable  to  receive  unserviceable  parts/scrap,  Combat Arms  will  coordinate  demilitarization  or  disposal  of  unserviceable  SA/LW  parts  according  to DoD 4160.21-M-1.  (T-0).  Where conflicts occur between TOs for the same weapon, follow the more stringent/detailed guidance. 6.6.1.  Weapons requiring depot maintenance are shipped to depot as complete end items in the  “As  Issued”  configuration,  to  include  all  accessories  (i.e.,  magazines,  slings,  original optics,  original  sights,  spare  barrel,  spare  barrel  cases  and  printed  copies  of  AFTO  Forms 105).  Do not ship SA/LW cannibalized, stripped of parts, or those containing unserviceable parts,  back  to  depot  when  they  are  repairable/replaceable  by  Combat  Arms,  unless specifically  authorized  by  the  Small  Arms  Program  Office,  AFLCMC/EBRMW.    If MAJCOMs/functions/units have received approval as outlined in this instruction to add parts or  accessories  to  Air  Force  SA/LW,  Combat  Arms  and/or  the  owning  organization  must remove them and return the weapons to “As Issued” configuration before returning them to depot or turning them into Base Supply as excess items.  (T-1). 6.6.2.  Limited  parts  cannibalization  may  be  accomplished  by  Combat  Arms  personnel  for the  sole  purpose  of  reducing  the  total  number  of  unserviceable  SA/LW  assigned  to  a  unit.  This  procedure  is  limited  to  SA/LW  assigned  within  the  same  unit.   An example  of  proper use  of  this  procedure  would  be  four  SA/LW  with  four  different  broken  parts  such  as  a missing sling, cracked hand guard, pistol grip and stock.  Placing all of these broken parts on one weapon would result in only one weapon being tagged for repairs versus four.  When the weapon is repaired, all new parts are installed and annotated appropriately.  CAUTION: Do not exchange any parts expressly forbidden in the TO or other guidance. 6.7.  Inspection  of  Weapons:  Use  the  guidance  in  the  following  paragraphs  along  with  the weapon TOs to conduct inspections of SA/LW.  Combat Arms performs weapons inspections to determine  weapon  serviceability,  safety,  discover  conditions  causing  (or  that  could  cause) failures,  and  to  determine  if  required  preventive  maintenance  checks  are  being  performed.  Additionally,  Combat  Arms  will  verify  the  serial  numbers  of  all  inspected  SA/LW  against  the unit’s  Custodian  Authorization/Custody  Receipt  Listing  (CA/CRL)  during  all  types  of inspections  and  report  any  discrepancies  to  the  Base  Supply  Equipment  Management  Section (EMS).  (T-2).  Qualified Combat Arms personnel will inspect military SA/LW assigned to all organizations.  (T-1).  Annually, Combat Arms personnel are to contact the Base Supply EMS to validate the SA/LW types, quantities, and accounts  assigned to  the installation.  This  may  also include local school/university ROTC programs with drill weapons.  Occasionally, new SA/LW are  received  and  accounts  are  established  without  custodians  notifying  the  servicing  Combat Arms  section.    This  same  validation  process  is  applied  to  units  who  are  supported  IAW  an approved support agreement and that do not have their own  assigned Combat Arms  personnel.    80  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 The  Combat  Arms  section  is  responsible  for  obtaining  sufficient  levels  of  tools  and  gauges needed to accomplish inspections on service SA/LW.  Additionally, they must ensure gauges are processed for calibration through the servicing PMEL at intervals established in TO 33K-1-100-2,  Technical  Manual,  TMDE  Calibration  Interval  Technical  Order  and  Work  Unit  Code Reference Guide.  (T-1).  Where conflicts occur between TOs for the same weapon, follow the more stringent/detailed guidance. 6.7.1.  Organizations and individuals possessing SA/LW are responsible for the following: 6.7.1.1.  Coordinating  inspections  with  all  applicable  agencies  (Combat  Arms,  Traffic Management Office, Packing and Crating, Supply, and Resource Protection). 6.7.1.2.  Preparing the SA/LW for inspection and initiating DD Forms 1574, Serviceable Tag,  for  extended  storage  SA/LW.    Do  not  place  DD  Form  1574  on  in-use  SA/LW.  Combat  Arms  accomplishes  initial  creation  of  the  AFTO  Form  105  in  SFMIS  for weapons not previously entered. 6.7.1.3.  Ensuring  all  SA/LW  are  cleaned  and  ready  for  inspection,  to  include  the mechanical zeroing of extended storage SA/LW IAW applicable TOs. 6.7.2.  Pre-Issue Inspection.  Base supply or the organization receiving SA/LW from depot or another  installation  must  notify  the  Combat  Arms  section  within  10  days  (ANG/AFRC within  30  days)  to  schedule  a  weapons  inspection.    (T-2).    Combat  Arms  personnel  must inspect SA/LW within 30 days (ANG/AFRC within 60 days) of notification.  (T-2).  Combat Arms  must  inspect  all  SA/LW  prior  to  units  placing  them  into  operational  service  or extended storage.  (T-1).  This inspection consists of disassembly, gauging, proper assembly and  function  check.    If  required,  Combat  Arms  personnel  assist  owning  organizations  in completing the SF 368, as outlined in TO 00-35D-54.  Combat Arms personnel enter “Pre-issue Inspection/Gauged” on the weapon’s AFTO Form 105 in SFMIS. 6.7.3.  Inspection  of  In-Use  SA/LW.    In-use  SA/LW  are  those  not  in  extended  storage packaging  IAW  Specialized  Packing  Instructions  (SPI).    As  a  minimum,  Combat  Arms personnel  will  perform  this  inspection  on  active  in-use  SA/LW  semi-annually  (every  six months) and on inactive in-use SA/LW annually (every 12 months).   (T-1).   Combat Arms will inspect active in-use SA/LW not used for operational purposes and used exclusively for training  (except  for  Combat  Arms  training  SA/LW)  annually  (every  12  months).    (T-1).  Combat Arms will complete these semi-annual and annual inspections within 30 days before or after the date of the previous inspection.  (T-2).  All in-use SA/LW inspected will have a complete  serviceability lubrication,  authorized parts/accessories and complete function check.  (T-1).  Weapons found to have been painted or coated with a substance other than that authorized in the applicable TO should be removed from service immediately.  At least 25 percent of the SA/LW are to receive full gauging IAW maintenance  TOs.    AFSFC/SFXW  may  increase  this  percentage.    However,  under  no circumstances  may  this  percentage  be  reduced  to  less  than  25  percent.    Combat  Arms  will develop a local method of tracking SA/LW that have been gauged by serial number to ensure the  same  weapons  are  not  gauged  on  subsequent  inspections,  until  all  weapons  have  been gauged.  (T-1).  This is not required if Combat Arms gauges 100 percent of in-use SA/LW during all in-use inspections.  This inspection may be accomplished at the time the SA/LW are used for firearms training or staggered throughout the year to meet requirements.  At the time  of  inspection,  Combat  Arms  will  ensure  all  quadrant  sights,  magazines,  spare  barrels, include  cleanliness, inspection to AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   81  tripods,  traversing  and  elevating  mechanisms,  and  other  subassemblies  of  crew-served SA/LW  are  inspected  for  serviceability.    (T-1).    Combat  Arms  will  add  a  statement  to  the inspection report describing the quantity and type of items inspected, the condition in which they  were  found,  and  whether  corrective  actions  are  needed  or  were  accomplished.    (T-2).  All  items  with  a  serial  number  and  open  discrepancies  should  be  reflected  in  the  report  to assist  in  accountability  and  tracking  of  corrective  actions.    Combat  Arms  must  inspect weapons not available for the inspection (temporary duty [TDY], issued, etc.) within 15 duty days  upon  return  from  TDY  or  issued  status.    (T-2).    Combat  Arms  personnel  will  enter “Semi-Annual  Inspection”  or  “Annual  Inspection”  (for  inactive  in-use  SA/LW)  on  the weapon’s  AFTO  Form  105  in  SFMIS  and  “Semi-Annual  Inspection/Gauged”  or  “Annual Inspection/Gauged”  (for  inactive  in-use  SA/LW)  on  those  receiving  full  gauging.    (T-1).  Pre-deployment  inspections  and/or  post-deployment  inspections  satisfy  the  requirements  of this paragraph if they are accomplished within the required inspection period. 6.7.4.  Inspection of Combat Arms  Training Weapons.  Combat Arms  must  complete a full serviceability inspection, including  gauging, on  all rifles and pistols  assigned to  the section IAW  maintenance  TOs  semi-annually  (ANG  and  AFRC  units  will  inspect  Combat  Arms rifles  and  pistols  annually).    (T-1).    This  inspection  may  be  accomplished  at  the  time  the SA/LW are used for firearms training or staggered throughout the year to meet requirements.  At  the  time  of  inspection,  ensure  all  quadrant  sights,  magazines,  spare  barrels,  tripods, traversing  and  elevating  mechanisms,  and  other  subassemblies  of  crew-served  SA/LW  are inspected  for  serviceability.    AFSFC/FGWL  may  change  this  requirement  to  a  percentage less than 100 percent,  for USAFA, Regional Training Centers and AETC bases  conducting BMT/Technical  Training,  as  appropriate.    However,  under  no  circumstances  will  this percentage be reduced to less than 20 percent.  Combat Arms personnel enter “Semi-Annual Inspection/Gauged” on the weapon’s AFTO Form 105 in SFMIS.  (T-1). 6.7.5.  Inspection  of  Weapons  in  Extended  Storage/Preferred  Packaging.    Units  should  not remove SA/LW from extended storage for use during exercises unless absolutely necessary and  authorized  by  the  installation  commander.    Inspection  of  these  SA/LW  takes  a  joint effort  from  the  organization  or  unit  possessing  the  SA/LW,  Traffic  Management  Branch (Preservation,  Packing  and  Packaging),  Base  Supply  and  Combat  Arms.    Combat  Arms personnel  will  perform  a  serviceability  inspection  immediately  before  units  return  the SA/LW to extended storage, IAW special packaging instructions (SPI).  (T-1).  The owning organization  must  ensure  weapons  are  properly  packaged/sealed  within  30  days  of  this inspection  or  re-inspection  is  required.    (T-1).    Combat  Arms  will  also  conduct  this inspection  on  all  SA/LW  removed  from  packaging,  prior  to  them  being  placed  into operational  use,  deployed  or  repackaged  for  extended  storage.    (T-1).    Pre-deployment inspections and/or post-deployment inspections satisfy the requirements of this paragraph if conducted  within for  weapon  system  at https://spires.wpafb.af.mil/; enter NSN for weapon in “Quick Search.”   Obtain  SPI’s the  specified times. 6.7.5.1.  Combat Arms will perform a serviceability inspection of 100 percent of weapons removed  from  extended  storage/preferred  packaging  during  periodic  (every  18  months) hands-on  serialized  inventories  before  units  return  the  weapons  to  extended  storage packaging.  (T-1).  Owning units will ensure all weapons are cleaned and lubricated prior to the Combat Arms inspection and before the weapons are returned to extended storage packaging.  (T-1).  The 100 percent Combat Arms inspection includes a visual inspection   82  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 for  corrosion,  damaged/worn/missing  parts,  unauthorized  accessories/modifications, function  check  and  proper  cleaning/lubrication.    Combat  Arms  should  pay  particular attention  to  proper  lubrication  of  the  weapons  to  prevent  corrosion  during  extended storage.  All personnel, including Combat Arms that handle weapons must wear lint-free, clean gloves to prevent contamination of the weapons prior to being repacked.  (T-1). 6.7.5.2.  Combat  Arms  will  gauge  a  minimum  of  20  percent  of  each  model  weapon during  this  18-month  inspection  and  ensure  that  weapons  gauged  during  previous  18-month inspections are not gauged again until the entire quantity of weapons of the same model have been gauged.     (T-1).  If Combat Arms finds any unsatisfactory conditions (corrosion,  failure  to  pass  gauging  checks,  missing  parts,  etc.),  they  will  gauge  an additional  five  percent  of  the  same  model  weapon.    (T-1).    If  Combat  Arms  finds unsatisfactory conditions on these weapons, they will gauge 50 percent of the same type weapon and if any unsatisfactory conditions are found on these weapons, they will gauge 100  percent  of  the  same  model  weapons.    (T-1).    Combat  Arms  personnel  will  enter “Extended  Storage  Inspection/Gauged”  or  “Extended  Storage  Inspection”  as  applicable on the weapon’s AFTO Form 105 in SFMIS.   (T-1).  Weapons removed from extended storage/preferred packaging for deployment must receive a full serviceability inspection, including gauging, within 120 days of deployment.  (T-1).  Extended storage inspections, including  gauging,  conducted  within  this  time  meet  the  Pre-embarkation  Inspection requirements. 6.7.5.3.  If the owning unit does not  remove weapons from  extended storage to  conduct hands-on  serialized  inventories,  Combat  Arms  does  not  open  containers  to  conduct  any periodic  inspections.    However,  Combat  Arms  will  conduct  a  complete  serviceability inspection,  including  gauging,  of  all  weapons  when  they  are  removed  from  extended storage/preferred  packaging  before  they  are  placed  into  use  and/or  immediately  before they  are  returned  to  extended  storage  packaging.    (T-1).    This  paragraph  refers  to weapons  removed  from  extended  storage  for  reasons  other  than  those  discussed  in paragraphs  6.7.5.1.  and  6.7.5.2.    Combat  Arms  personnel  will  enter  “Extended  Storage Inspection/Gauged” on the weapon’s AFTO Form 105 in SFMIS.  (T-1). 6.7.6.  Pre-embarkation Inspections.  Due to the time required to conduct these in-depth and detailed  inspections,  units  alerted  for  deployment  need  to  contact  Combat  Arms  as  soon  as possible  to  schedule/conduct  this  inspection.    Combat  Arms  completes  a  full  serviceability inspection,  including  gauging.    If  the  weapon  has  received  a  serviceability  inspection including gauging for other reasons within the required time, it satisfies the requirement for the pre-embarkation inspection and Combat Arms annotates this on the AFTO Form 105 in SFMIS.    Combat  Arms  will  complete  this  inspection  within  120  days  of  the  weapon departing  the  installation  for  deployment  or  expeditionary  training  if  the  weapon  will  not return to home station before deployment.  (T-1).  This requirement should be included in the Installation Deployment Plan.  The Security Forces/Combat Arms organizational commander may work with the installation deployment officer to establish a centralized location for this inspection.  Combat Arms must ensure all SA/LW and associated equipment being deployed meet  the  applicable  TO  requirements.    (T-1).    Combat  Arms  personnel  will  enter  “Pre-embarkation  Inspection”  on  the  weapon’s  AFTO  Forms  105  in  SFMIS.    (T-1).    Ensure  the unit sends the SFMIS AFTO Form 105 with the SA/LW. AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   83  6.7.7.  Post  Deployment  Inspections.    Unit  weapons  account  custodians  will  notify  Combat Arms and base supply within 5 duty days of weapons returning from deployed locations.  (T-2).    Combat  Arms  personnel  will  perform  a  complete  serviceability  inspection  on  in-use SA/LW  returning  from  deployments  exceeding  30  days  and  any  SA/LW  removed  from extended storage, regardless of deployment length.  (T-1).  Perform a complete serviceability inspection  including  gauging  on  100  percent  of  all  SA/LW  IAW  maintenance  TOs.    (T-1).  Weapons found to have been painted or coated with a substance other than that authorized in the applicable TO should be removed from service immediately.  Accomplish this inspection within  60  days  of  return  date  on  in-use  SA/LW  and  within  120  days  on  SA/LW  being returned to extended storage.  (T-1).  Combat Arms personnel will enter “Post Deployment Inspection”  on  the  SFMIS  weapon’s  AFTO  Form  105  and  enter  any  maintenance accomplished while deployed if not previously entered.  (T-1). 6.7.8.  Turn-In  Inspection.    Combat  Arms  will  perform  a  complete  serviceability  inspection to include full gauging on all SA/LW and accessories being turned in to Base Supply.  (T-1).  Only  approved  stock-listed  items  for  the  weapon  are  authorized  for  turn  in.    Non-standard items such as after-market slings, sights, grips, camouflage paint, or other items are removed and replaced (if applicable) with stock-listed items.  Combat Arms will ensure repair of the weapon  (within  their  authorization)  if  parts  are  unserviceable.    (T-1).    Combat  Arms personnel  will  enter  “Turn-in  Inspection/Gauged”  on  the  weapon’s  AFTO  Form  105  in SFMIS.    (T-1).    Combat  Arms  will  notify  the  unit  of  damaged  or  missing  accessories required for complete end item turn-in.  (T-1).  The owning unit is responsible for replacing these  accessories  prior  to  turn-in,  ensuring  a  DD  Form  1574  is  attached  to  the  weapon  and including a print out of the AFTO Form 105 with the weapon. 6.7.9.  Inspection  Reports.    Refer  to  paragraph  2.2.13.  for  weapon  inspection  report requirements and procedures. 6.8.  Packaging Weapons:  Packaging SA/LW for shipment or storage takes a joint effort from the  organization  or  unit  possessing  the  SA/LW,  Traffic  Management  Branch  (Preservation, Packing  and  Packaging),  Base  Supply  and  Combat  Arms.    Before  packaging  SA/LW,  Combat Arms personnel must inspect the SA/LW and complete the DD 1574 or DD 1577-2 (if required).   (T-1).    A  completed  SFMIS  generated  AFTO  Form  105  must  accompany  the  weapon  in shipment  through  supply  channels  if  the  weapon  is  being  returned  to  depot.    (T-1).    Weapons will be prepared and packed for shipment or storage according to applicable SPI or TO.   (T-1).  The  owning  organization  is  responsible  for  packaging  and/or  sealing  SA/LW  scheduled  for shipment or storage.  For example, M16 rifles will be packed for storage or shipment according to  SPI  00-856-6885,  Special  Packaging  Instruction,  M16  Rifle  or  M9  pistols  use  SPI  00-317-2468.  Organizations may obtain SPI’s for weapon systems at https://spires.wpafb.af.mil/; enter NSN for weapon in “Quick Search.”        84  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 6.9.  Support Agreements (Weapons Maintenance Support):  The host Combat Arms section will provide all SA/LW maintenance support, mandated in this chapter, to those tenant Air Force units without their own AFSC 3P0X1B, SEI 312 or DoD civilian equivalent personnel assigned.  (T-3).  Tenant units without sufficient numbers of their own AFSC 3P0X1B, SEI 312, or civilian equivalent personnel assigned and present during a Unit Training Assembly (UTA), request host Combat Arms support to augment their personnel during SA/LW maintenance cycles through the host-base  Security  Forces/Combat  Arms  organizational  commander.    If  host  Combat  Arms manpower support is  required, it needs to  be provided if manpower permits.  For  AFRC units, this  support  includes  complete  access  to  and  use  of  all  SA/LW  maintenance  facilities,  tools, gauges, publications, and any other items necessary for SA/LW maintenance.  Unless specified in  the  support  agreement,  and  agreed  upon  by  the  host  Security  Forces/Combat  Arms organizational  commander,  this  support  does  not  include  spare  SA/LW  parts.    Formalize  this training and/or support through an agreement according to AFI 25-201.  ALLEN J.

Overview.  Air Force Risk Management (RM) is a tool used to assess the risks associated with continued use of existing firing ranges that do not satisfy the minimum criteria outlined in AFI  36-2654,  Combat  Arms  Program  and  Engineering  Technical  Letter  (ETL)  11-18,    Small Arms  Range  Design  and  Construction  (and  future  versions).    For  further  information  on  RM, refer to AFI 90-802, Risk Management, and AFPAM 90-803, Risk Management (RM) Guidelines and Tools.  Combat Arms and base agencies use the guidance and processes for RM along with the criteria identified in AFI 36-2654 and ETL 11-18 to determine the condition and corrective actions needed when inspecting Air Force small arms ranges.  Additionally, the small arms range inspection  checklist  in  Attachment  3  to  AFI  36-2654  provides  a  listing  of  some  key  areas  of small  arms  ranges  that  should  be  inspected  for  potential  safety,  health  or  environmental problems.    NOTE:    All  Air  Force  range  criteria  will  be  moved  to  the  Air  Force  Indoor  Small Arms Range building information modeling (BIM) facilities criteria documents in the future and this will replace the ETL.  Users may obtain the BIM documents via the USAF Combat Arms, Air  Force  Network (EIS)  website (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/). Information  Services (AFNet),  Enterprise A2.2.  5-Step  RM  Process.  RM is a continuous, systematic decision-making tool consisting of five  primary  steps  that  define  the  formal  RM  process  associated  with  Deliberative  RM considerations.  The five steps of the process are listed and broken down into several sub-steps called “actions” as follows: A2.2.1.  (Step 1)  Identify the Hazard.  This step has three actions: A2.2.1.1.  Mission/task analysis.  (e.g., training personnel to fire weapons) A2.2.1.2.  Listing the hazards.  (e.g., fired rounds leaving the range) A2.2.1.3.  Listing the causes.  (e.g., baffles are of insufficient thickness) A2.2.1.3.1.  Listing  the  causes  of  the  hazards  is  the  action  where  deficiencies  or discrepancies  are  items  found  to  not  satisfy  the  ETL  criteria.    A  tabular  method  for recording these actions and steps is prescribed in A2.2.2. A2.2.2.  (Step 2)  Assess the Risk.  This step has four actions: A2.2.2.1.  Assess  hazard  exposure.    Exposure  is  measured  in  terms  of  time,  proximity, volume or repetition.  (e.g., 1,000 rounds fire weekly) A2.2.2.2.  Assess hazard severity.  Determine severity of the hazard in terms of potential impact on personnel, equipment or mission/activity.  Hazard severity is determined by the following severity categories: A2.2.2.2.1.  Category I: Catastrophic (i.e., mission failure, death, system loss) A2.2.2.2.2.  Category  II:  Critical  (i.e.,  major  mission  degradation,  severe  injury,  or major system damage) A2.2.2.2.3.  Category III: Moderate (i.e., minor mission degradation, injury or system damage) AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   99  A2.2.2.2.4.  Category IV: Negligible (i.e., little mission degradation, injury, or system damage) A2.2.2.3.  Assess  probability.    Determine  the  probability  that  the  hazard  will  cause  a negative event of the severity assessed.  Probability may be determined through estimates or actual numbers (if available). A2.2.2.3.1.  Probability A – Frequent, daily, often, 10-1 or greater frequency. A2.2.2.3.2.  Probability B – Likely, three weeks, occurs several times, 10-1 (10%) to 10-2 (1%). A2.2.2.3.3.  Probability  C  –  Occasional,  six  months,  will  occur,  10-2  (1%)  to  10-3 (.1%). A2.2.2.3.4.  Probability  D  –  Seldom,  five  years,  could  occur,  10-3  (.1%)  to  10-6 (.0001%). A2.2.2.3.5.  Probability  E  –  Unlikely,  past  five  years  has  not  occurred,  rarely,  10-6 (.0001%) or less. A2.2.2.4.  Complete risk assessment:  Combine severity & probability estimates to form a risk assessment for each hazard.  Assign a risk assessment level based on the combination of steps A2.2.2.2 and A2.2.2.3.  See Figure A2.1. Figure A2.1.  Sample Risk Assessment Matrix.    100  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 A2.2.3.  (Step  3)  Develop controls  and make decisions.  Effective control  measures reduce or eliminate one of the three components (probability, severity or exposure) of risk.  Decision makers at the appropriate level choose the best control or combination of controls based on the analysis of overall costs and benefits.  This step has five actions: A2.2.3.1.  Identify  control  options:  Each  control  measures  should  eliminate  or  mitigate the  risk  of  a  hazard.    Controls  may  be  applied  using  multiple  means  engineering, physical, administrative or operational methods. A2.2.3.2.  Determine control effects: Select the control options desired for consideration.  With controls  identified, the hazard should be re-assessed, taking into consideration the effect  the  control  will  have  on  the  severity  and/or  probability.    The  new  estimated value(s) for severity and/or probability and the change in  overall risk assessed from  the Risk Assessment Matrix should be recorded. A2.2.3.3.  Prioritize the control measures:  For each hazard, prioritize those risk controls that will reduce the risk to an acceptable level.  The best controls will be consistent with mission  objectives  and  optimize  use  of  available  resources  (manpower,  material, equipment, funding and time). A2.2.3.4.  Select risk controls:  For each identified hazard, select those risk controls that will  reduce  the  risk  to  an  acceptable  level.    The  best  controls  will  be  consistent  with mission/activity objectives and optimum use of available resources (manpower, material, equipment, funding, and time). A2.2.3.5.  Make  Risk  Decisions.    Analyze  the  level  of  risk  for  the  operation  or  activity with  the  proposed  controls  in  place.    Determine  if  the  benefits  of  the  operation/activity now exceed the level of risk the operation/ activity presents.  When a decision is made to assume risk, the factors (cost versus benefit information) involved in this decision should be recorded. A2.2.4.  (Step  4)  Implement  Controls.    Implementation  requires  commitment  of  time  and resources.  Once the risk control decision is made, and an implementation plan developed for initiating the controls, assets must be made available to implement the specific controls.  This step has three actions: A2.2.4.1.  Make the implementation clear to all parties. A2.2.4.2.  Establish  accountability  and  responsibility  for  implementing  risk-control measures.    The  accountable  person  is  the  one  who  makes  the  decision  (approves  the control  measures),  and  hence,  the  right  person  (appropriate  level)  must  make  the decision. A2.2.4.3.  Provide support to those tasked to implement the control measures. A2.2.5.  (Step  5)  Supervise  and  Evaluate.    This  step  involves  the  determination  of  the effectiveness of risk controls throughout the operation.  There are three actions in this step: A2.2.5.1.  Supervise  the  implementation  of  the  control  measures  to  ensure  controls  are effective and remain in place; identify changes requiring further RM; and action is taken to correct ineffective risk controls. AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016   101  A2.2.5.2.  Evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  control  measures  risk  reduction  and  cost implication.  Process evaluation must be systematic.  Establish metrics/tools to accurately measure effectiveness. A2.2.5.3.    Provide  feedback  to  continually  make  improvements  to  the  risk  management process.    Feedback  informs  all  involved  as  to  how  the  implementation  process  is  working, and whether or not the controls were effective.  The feedback loop completes the circular RM process and validates successful risk reduction or identifies the need for additional mitigation actions. A2.3.  Formal  Risk Assessment.  A formal risk assessment succinctly documents the results of the deliberate 5-Step RM process and supports follow-on decision-making processes.  Decision options typically involve determining whether one or more particular COAs should be pursued (e.g.,  implementing  equipment  improvements,  safety  or  warning  device  improvements, operational  improvements,  technical  improvements,  policy/procedure  improvements),  and whether a risk should be accepted, mitigated or rejected.  A risk assessment  supports decision-making  processes  by  objectively  identifying  a  hazard,  assessing  its  risk,  thoroughly  analyzing potential options for mitigation and making a recommendation.  The AF Form 4437, Deliberate Risk Assessment Worksheet, can be used to conduct the formal risk assessment.  Refer to Table A2.1.  and  Figures  A2.2.  through  A2.5.,  for  examples  of  the  5-Step  RM  process  with  some common small arms range discrepancies and a completed AF Form 4437.   102  AFI36-2654  13 JANUARY 2016 Table A2.1.

Combat  Arms  and  other  base  agencies  use  the  range  inspection  checklist  in Table A3.1. along with AFI 90-802, Risk Management, AFPAM 90-803, Risk Management (RM) Guidelines  and  Tools,  the  current  Small  Arms  Range  Design  and  Construction  Engineering Technical Letter/Air Force Small Arms Range Facility Criteria, as well as AFI 36-2654, Combat Arms Program, to conduct range safety inspections and to verify compliance with design criteria.  This  checklist  is  not  all-inclusive  and  units  need  to  reference  the  other  sources  listed  above, along with any guidance provided by manufacturers, to ensure all pertinent items are inspected and  maintained.    Use  risk  management  principles  and  procedures  to  determine  appropriate actions when problems are identified. A3.2.  Development  of  Local  Checklist.  With  the  assistance  of  other  base  agencies  (e.g.,  CE environmental, safety, BE), Combat Arms modifies this checklist to identify items that apply to their  specific  range,  add  items  that  are  not  already  on  the  list  and  remove  items  that  are  not needed.  Combat Arms will update the local checklist annually and when changes occur that may alter work practices or when conditions exists that indicate the potential to cause a health, safety or environmental risk.

Range Name/Location: Range Type (Partially Contained, Fully Contained, etc.):  Target Distance(s):   Calibers/Types of Rounds Approved for Use:   Section B. Category I: Catastrophic Hazard Severity (Projectile Containment). B.  Range construction/design must ensure projectiles do not leave the range and must ensure rounds do not produce hazardous ricochets within the range.  Answering “No” to the questions in this section indicates a Category I (Catastrophic) hazard severity.  Range closure until the discrepancy is resolved is highly recommended.  NOTE: Some older ranges were designed to allow  non-direct  fired  projectiles  (ricochets)  to  leave  the  range  at  steep  angles  because  the associated Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) was large enough to contain the bullets, mitigating the risk.    For  partially  contained  baffled  ranges,  if  the  range  has  an  adequate  SDZ,  some  of  the risks  associated  with  non-direct  fired  projectiles  leaving  the  range,  may  have  already  been mitigated.  Direct-fired rounds must never escape the range on any type of baffled range.  Yes  No  N/A 1.  On a baffled range, is the range constructed to prevent any “Blue Sky” visible from all firing points and positions? 2.

On a machine gun tube range, is the backstop no further away than    150 feet (45.7 meters) from the firing line to the centerline of the backstop? 2.   Are large rocks removed from the firing range floor to eliminate ricochet hazards?   3.   Are ranges built to ensure ground baffles are not used?  (Short of complete removal of ground baffles, their presence may be mitigated by ensuring they are faced with at least 30 mm of FRT soft wood.) 4.   On a baffled range with angled baffles, are overhead baffles angled at 12 to 32 degrees to eliminate ricochet rounds from leaving the range? 5.

On an impact range, are targets used for other weapon systems positioned so they do not interfere with other training or pose a ricochet hazard? 26.   On a range with a backstop deflector plates, are exposed steel plate edges chamfered to a 45-degree angle or to a fillet approximately 4mm thick? 27.   If a water trap is used, does it cover the entire area under the backstop and is the water level maintained at a level not less than 12 inches deep?                     Section D. Category II: Critical Hazard Severity (Exterior Range Safety). D.  Range  construction/design  must  ensure  personnel  exterior  to  the  range  are  as  safe  as possible.  Answering “No” to the questions in this section indicates a  Category  II  (Critical) hazard  severity.    Range  closure  until  the  discrepancy  is  eliminated  or  immediate  mitigation should be considered. 1.
