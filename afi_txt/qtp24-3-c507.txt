Crew Light/Rear Ramp Light Switches.   5.2.4.  After-operation inspection.  5.2.4.1.  Cleanliness/damage/missing items (always keep the vehicle clean inside  and out).  5.2.4.2.  All wheel rims (cracks, splits, etc.); check for loose or missing lug nut.  5.2.4.3.  Welds; check for loose or chipped paint, rust or gaps.  5.2.4.4.  Visually check for fluid and water leakage.  5.2.5.  A Seven-Step Inspection Method will help ensure the inspection is the same each time it is conducted, and that nothing is left out.  See Attachment 4 for the Seven-Step Inspection Method. 5.2.6.  Types of Vehicle Inspection.  If discrepancies are found they must  be reported to the Vehicle  Control  Officer/Vehicle  Control  Non  Commissioned  Officer  (VCO/VCNCO),  the supervisor, and/or vehicle maintenance:      5.3. Vehicle Safety and Equipment.  5.3.1.  Types of common mishaps include:  5.3.1.1.  Bruises,  head  injuries,  cuts  and  lacerations  to  personnel.    Personnel  must  wear head protection while travelling in the MRAP.  5.3.1.2.  Fatalities due to rollovers.  5.3.2.  Hazards and human factors:  5.3.2.1.  Jerky starts and stops.  5.3.2.2.  Failure to give proper signals when turning.  5.3.2.3.  Traveling too fast and turning too sharply.  5.3.2.4.  Failure to release parking brake before traveling.  5.3.2.5.  Failure to use a spotter in difficult areas/situations.  Spotters must be trained and use hand signals IAW AFMAN 24-306.  5.3.2.6.  Rollover risk.   5.3.3.  Safety clothing and equipment:  5.3.3.1.  Safety steel-toed boots must be worn.  5.3.3.2.  Head protection, as required.  5.3.3.3.  Raingear, cold weather gear, etc.  5.3.3.4.  Reflective belt during hours of reduced visibility.  5.3.3.5.  Hearing protection/eye protection.  5.3.3.6.  Hand protection, as required.  5.3.3.7.  Tire gauge.  5.3.3.8.  Fire extinguisher.  5.4. Driving Safety and Precautions.  5.4.1.  Operator is responsible for safety of personnel riding in vehicle.  Operator will not move vehicle if any passenger is in an unsafe position or vehicle has too many passengers.  5.4.2.  Ensure  personnel  protective  equipment  is  on.    Identify  and  understand  cautions  and warning listed in the operator’s manual and vehicle to prevent serious injury/death to personnel or damage to the vehicle.  5.4.3.  Secure all cargo and/or equipment inside of the vehicle prior to operation.  5.4.4.  Never  start  or  operate  the  MRAP  from  any  other  place  than  the  Operator’s  seat.  Passengers will ride in the provided seat.  Always keep all body parts inside the vehicle, unless up in the turret.  5.4.5.  Always  monitor  gauges  during  vehicle  operation.    Do  not  ignore  warning  lights  or audible alarms.  5.4.5.1.  If  oil  pressure,  air  pressure,  engine  temperature,  or  transmission  temperature exceed the maximum or drop below the minimum range, stop the vehicle in a safe place as soon as the tactical situation permits.  5.4.5.2.  If  CHECK  TRANSMISSION  light  turns  on  during  vehicle  operation,  shifting may become restricted.  5.4.6.  Engage or disengage differential locks as required for operating conditions.  5.4.7.  Make absolutely certain that the gunner’s hatch is completely locked in the open position before moving the vehicle with a gunner in position.  5.4.8.  Never drive the vehicle up to anyone standing in front of an object.  Make certain (by looking out one of the small rear windows) that no one is behind the  vehicle when lowering the rear door/ramp.  DO NOT operate the rear door/ramp when  t h e   vehicle is in motion.  Use extreme caution when using the emergency rear door/ramp  release to ensure that no one can be struck by the door as it falls open.  Keep arms and  legs clear of rear door/ramp when closing it.  Note:  Failure to comply may result in serious  injury or death to personnel.  5.4.9.  Before opening hood, make sure that there is enough room in front of the vehicle for the hood to open completely without being pinned or pinched or pinning or an assistant between the  hood  and  any other structure.    Note:    Failure  to  comply may result  in  serious  injury or death.   5.4.10.  DO NOT use steering wheel for hand grip to enter vehicle.  Use of steering wheel for hand grip may cause sudden violent jerking of the vehicle.  When entering or exiting cab,  use three-point contact system.  5.4.11.  DO NOT operate vehicle with air pressure system loss; this is extremely dangerous.   Vehicle has reduced or no braking capability and may not stop.  Note:  Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment and/or serious injury or death to personnel.  5.4.12.  DO NOT disconnect any airline or fitting until system pressure has been relieved.  Air under pressure can penetrate the skin.  5.4.13.  Ensure master power switches on both vehicles are OFF prior to connecting NATO slave  cables or before performing battery or other electrical maintenance.  Note:  Failure to comply  may result in serious injury or death to personnel.  5.4.14.  All snow and ice must be removed from the vehicle as soon as possible.  Snow and ice may slow or stop movement of crucial parts.  5.4.15.  If  operator  leaves  the  vehicle,  even  momentarily,  when  engine  is  running,  the transmission MUST be in neutral N; parking brake must be set and engaged, and wheels MUST be chocked.  5.4.16.  The vehicle must be completely stopped with the service brake applied before shifting between rear wheel and four-wheel drive, or to shift range in either mode.  Failure to comply may result in damage to equipment.  5.4.17.  Do not direct high-pressure water stream at seals, air intake, exhaust outlet, radiator, condenser or other components of vehicle that could be easily damaged by high-pressure water stream.  Failure to comply may result in damage to the driveline.  5.4.18.  Do  not  use  first  gear  to  move  vehicle  if  the  tires  are  frozen  to  the  ground  or  if  the brakes are frozen to the drums.  Failure to comply may result in damage to the driveline.  5.4.19.  Rollover risk warning.  The potential for a vehicle to rollover increases for vehicles with a high gross weight (20,000 lbs. or more) or a high center of gravity.  Check the vehicle’s data plate to determine if the vehicle is at higher risk for rollover.  5.4.20.  Do not attempt to tow or push start the MRAP.  5.4.21.  If the start/run switch is in the RUN position, but the engine has not started, this will drain the battery.  5.4.22.  Do not operate the starter for more than 20 seconds.  5.4.23.  If any instrument reading is not normal during-operation, turn-off the engine.  5.4.24.  During  jump  starting  procedures,  use  only  approved  M-series  jumper  cables  (slave cable).  5.4.25.  Be  alert  at  all  times  during  vehicle  operation  for  exhaust  odors,  do  NOT  operate vehicle in enclosed area.  Be alert for excessive exhaust fumes when backing the vehicle.  5.4.26.  Turn-off all radios within 50 feet of any refueling operation.  5.4.27.  Ensure  cell  phones  are  turned-off  prior  to  operation  of  vehicle  and  during  fueling operations.  5.4.28.  Off  Road  driving.    All  MRAPs  are  designed  for  use  over  all  types  of  roads,  in  all weather  conditions  and  the  most  difficult  terrain.    The  MRAPs  high  power-to-weight  ratio, four-wheel  drive,  and  high-ground  clearance  combined  to  give  it  outstanding  cross-country mobility.    Operators  should  use  extreme  caution  when  driving  in  unusual/unknown  terrain.  Road shoulders can give way, unexpected objects in the road can cause the operator to serve or  lose  control.    Situational  awareness  can  reduce  the  chance  of  driving  or  slipping  into canals/ditches.  See AFMAN 24-306 for additional guidance.  5.4.29.  Transition  a  slope  IAW  manufacturer’s  operator’s  manual  recommended  guidance.  The MRAP is a high center of gravity vehicle and is susceptible to rollover.  Transitioning a side slope at the appropriate angle and using safe operation is necessary to prevent injury and equipment damage.  5.4.29.1.   Rocky terrain.  5.4.29.1.1.  Do not try to straddle large boulders; they will damage axles and other low parts  of the vehicle.  Move slowly over when driving in rocky terrain.  5.4.29.2.   Mud and swamps.  5.4.29.2.1.  Try  to  pull  out  of  the  mud/swamp  slowly  in  low  gear  if  the  vehicle  is equipped  with  an  automatic  transmission.    Place  boards,  brush,  or  similar  material under the vehicle’s wheels can increase traction.  5.4.29.2.2.  Roll onto the soft area at a medium speed for the selected gear.  Carefully maintain a steady throttle until reaching solid ground.  5.4.29.2.3.  If  the vehicle is in  an  automatic, try to  pull out  slowly by switching to  a lower gear.    If this or using boards or brush does not work, try to have another vehicle pull the vehicle  out.  5.4.29.3.   Ditches.  5.4.29.3.1.  Cross  shallow  ditches  by  shifting into  low  gear  or  range  and  proceeding slowly.    Enter the ditch at an angle so that one wheel leaves the ditch as the other wheel on the same side enters it.  5.4.29.4.   Gullies and ravines.    5.4.29.4.1.  Find a place to enter that is  easy access  and  easy to  get across.    Put  the vehicle in low gear and slowly approach the ravine at a right angle to the  edge.  Using the foot brake, ease the front wheels into the gully; make sure they  hit at the same time.  Bring the engine up to a normal speed before the wheels  hit the bottom.  Accelerate just enough to climb so that the front wheels touch the  opposite bank.  5.4.29.5.   Slippery conditions.  5.4.29.5.1.  Vehicle  operation  in  slippery  conditions  is  hazardous.    The  MRAP  is equipped with  ABS but  it  cannot provide any  better braking and steering capability than available road traction will permit.    Operator must travel at reduced speeds and be prepared to meet sudden changes  in road conditions.  5.4.29.5.2.  Failure  to  maintain  safe stopping distances  will  cause  damage  to  vehicle and/or  injury or death to personnel. 5.4.29.5.3.  Apply service breaks sooner and press service brake pedal lightly to give early  warning to any vehicles that may be following. 5.4.29.5.4.  After driving through slush or water, drive slowly and test service brakes. 5.4.29.5.5.  To  dry  out  brake  shoes  and  drums,  lightly  press  and  hold  service  brake pedal  for 5 to 10 seconds at a time while lightly applying throttle. 5.4.29.5.6.  Chock  blocks  shall  be  used  when  parking  a  vehicle  in  extreme  cold conditions.    Failure to do so may result in injury to personnel or damage to equipment.      5.4.30.  Rollovers.  5.4.30.1.   During a vehicle rollover, the senior occupant will ensure that ALL  personnel are  checked  for  injuries  and  that  injured  personnel  are  given  the  appropriate  medical attention.  Report the accident immediately along with  injury report.  5.4.30.2.   Rollover procedures:  5.4.30.2.1.  The  first  individual  to  notice a  vehicle  beginning to  rollover  will  shout, “ROLLOVER!”  5.4.30.2.2.  The operator will release the accelerator, keep hands on steering wheel with extended,  but  not  locked  arms,  tuck  head  in  to  chest  and  brace  for  impact  and  yell, “ROLLOVER!”  5.4.30.2.3.  The passenger(s)  will  tuck  their  head(s) into  chest  and brace for impact. He/she will plant feet firmly on the floor while holding on to a stationary object and yell, “ROLLOVER!”  5.4.30.2.4.  The gunner will drop down.  He/she will tuck head into chest and brace for impact.  He/she will plant feet firmly on the floor while holding on to a stationary object and yell,  “ ROLLOVER!”  Note:  Gunners operating the turret should limit body protrusion not to exceed the name tape.  5.4.31.  Braking safety.  5.4.31.1.   Braking without airbrakes.    5.4.31.1.1.  Speed and stopping distance.   There are three things that add up to  total stopping distance: 5.4.31.1.2.  Perception  Distance  +  Reaction  Distance  +  Braking  Distance  =  Total Stopping Distance.   5.4.31.1.3.  Perception distance.  This is the distance the vehicle moves from the time the operator’s eyes see a hazard until their brain knows it.  The perception time for an alert driver is about 3/4 second.  5.4.31.1.4.  Reaction distance.  The distance traveled from the time the operator’s brain tells their foot to move from the accelerator until their foot is actually pushing the brake pedal.    The  average  driver  has  a  reaction  time  of  3/4  second.    This  accounts  for  an additional 60 feet traveled at 55 mph.  5.4.31.1.5.  Braking distance.  The distance it takes to stop once the brakes are put on.  At 55 mph on dry pavement with good brakes, it can take a heavy vehicle about 170 feet to stop (about 4 3/4 seconds). 5.4.31.1.6.  Total stopping distance. At 55 mph it will take about 6 seconds to stop and the vehicle will travel about the distance of a football field (60 + 60 + 170 = 290 feet).  5.4.31.2.   Braking distance with air brakes.  5.4.31.2.1.  With air brakes there is an added delay:  the time required for the brakes to work after the brake pedal is pushed.  Thus, the total stopping distance for vehicles with air brake systems is made up of four different factors:  5.4.31.2.1.1.  Perception  Distance  +  Reaction  Distance  +  Brake  Lag  Distance  + Effective Braking Distance = Total Stopping Distance.  5.4.31.2.2.  The air brake lag distance at 55 mph on dry pavement adds about 32 feet. So at 55 mph for an average driver under good traction and brake conditions, the total stopping distance is over 300 feet. This is longer than a football field.   5.4.31.3.   Control and stopping requirements.   5.4.31.3.1.  The  service  brake  must  hold  the  vehicle  on  any  grade  on  which  it  is operated under all conditions of loading or unloading. 5.4.31.3.2.  The service brakes of every motor vehicle must be capable of stopping from an  initial  speed  of  20  miles  per  hour  and  is  measured  in  feet  as  maximum  stopping distance (MSD).   5.4.31.3.3.  For a vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 10,000 lbs. or more the MSD is 40 feet.  5.4.31.4.   Effects of speed on stopping distance. 5.4.31.4.1.  When the speed of the vehicle is doubled, it will take about four times the distance to stop, and the vehicle will have four times the destructive power if it crashes. 5.4.31.4.2.  High speeds increase stopping distances greatly.  By slowing down a little, the Operator can gain a lot in reduced braking distance.   5.4.32.  Tire changing procedures.  In the event that the vehicle should have a flat or damaged tire, the trainee must know the following procedures for properly and safely changing the tire:  5.4.32.1.   Equipment/tools:  5.4.32.1.1.  Vehicle jack w/jack handle rated for weight of vehicle.  5.4.32.1.2.  Lug wrench.    5.4.32.1.3.  Jack stand. 5.4.32.1.4.  Wheel chocks. 5.4.32.1.5.  Hand/eye/hearing protection (if pneumatic tools are going to be used).  5.4.32.2.   Tire changing steps:  5.4.32.2.1.   Use gloves when handling and lifting tires.  5.4.32.2.2.  Ensure the vehicle is seated on a level surface.  5.4.32.2.3.  Chock the adjacent drive wheel. 5.4.32.2.4.  Locate solid part of the vehicle’s frame.   5.4.32.2.5.  Place the vehicle jack under the vehicle’s frame as close as possible that will not impede the tire removal and/or replacement.              5.4.32.2.6.  Raise the vehicle with the jack until the vehicle’s weight is supported on the jack, but the tire is still in contact with the ground. 5.4.32.2.7.  Loosen, DO NOT, remove the lug nuts. 5.4.32.2.8.  Raise the vehicle up until the tire clears the ground with no more than an extra inch to allow replacement of the tire. 5.4.32.2.9.  Place the jack stand under the frame of the vehicle to support the vehicle in the case that the jack’s hydraulics should leak and/or fail. 5.4.32.2.10.  Remove the wheel’s lug nuts. 5.4.32.2.11. Remove the vehicle’s flat/damaged tire using two personnel. 5.4.32.2.12. Place the replacement tire onto the vehicle’s axle using two personnel. 5.4.32.2.13. Replace the vehicle’s lug nuts (to hand tightness). 5.4.32.2.14. Jack the vehicle up and remove the jack stand. 5.4.32.2.15. Lower  the  vehicle  until  the  wheel  makes  contact  with  the  ground  to prevent the tire from spinning during tightening, DO NOT put the entire vehicle weight on the wheel until after the next step. 5.4.32.2.16. Tighten  vehicle’s  lug  nuts  in  a  star  pattern  to  ensure  proper  seat  of  the wheel to the axle. 5.4.32.2.17. Lower the jack stand completely and remove from under the vehicle. Note:  Tighten loose lug nuts.  Have vehicle maintenance tighten the stud nuts and lug nuts to the proper torque found in the manufacturer’s operator’s manual.  5.4.33.  Winch safety.  5.4.33.1.   When recovering the cable, recovery takes time, do not hurry.  A broken winch line reacts like  a whip, when hooking to a vehicle, use both shackles whenever possible so effort is applied  equally and damage to the vehicle in minimized.  5.4.33.2.   Never bend the wire cable at a sharp angle.  5.4.33.3.   Straighten out all the kinks and twists while taking up the slack.  5.4.33.4.   Stand clear of the winch cable before it is tightened.   A cable being tightened may break and whip back causing serious bodily harm or even death.  5.4.33.5.   After using the winch, have one person or preferably two pull back on the cable while it is  wound slowly and even on the drum.   Keep the cable lubricated according to the manual.  5.5. Vehicle Operation.  5.5.1.  Starting procedures.  5.5.1.1.  Ensure that the MRAP is in the neutral position.  Apply parking brake.  5.5.1.2.  Adjust the driver’s seat and outside mirrors.  5.5.1.3.  Fasten safety belt, removing all slack out of the belt for proper use.  5.5.1.4.  Check position of fuel indicator switch.  5.5.1.5.  Check fuel gauges.  5.5.1.6.  Check that WAIT TO START warning indicator on the warning panel is not lit. See Figure 5.18.  Figure 5.18.  Warning Panel.    5.5.1.7.  Press accelerator lightly and move ignition switch to START.  See Figure 5.19.  5.5.1.8.  Push ignition switch UP until engine starts, release.  5.5.1.9.  Switch will move to RUN.  5.5.1.10.   For temperatures > 60°F, keep foot off accelerator while cranking.  See Figure 5.20.  5.5.1.11.   For temperatures <60°F, full depress accelerator after engaging the starter.    Figure 5.19.  Ignition Switch.   Figure 5.20.  Accelerator.     Note:  Do not overtax the starter or battery.  Do not crank the starter for more than 20 seconds at a time.  Wait at least 10-15 seconds between attempts.  5.5.1.12.   Allow  the  engine  to  reach  operating  temperature  prior  to  moving  the  vehicle (unless there is an emergency situation).  5.5.1.13.   If at this point the engine will not start, refer to the manufacturer’s operator’s manual for the troubleshooting section.  5.5.1.14.   After  engine  has  warmed  up  and  air  tanks  have  reached  130  psi,  press  brake pedal and listen for an audible leak.  Press the YELLOW push-pull switch and place the vehicle in the desired driving position (RED push-pull switch is for trailer use only).  5.5.1.15.   To turn on the lights; press the “Serv. Drive” button, then press “Enter” while flashing until light illuminates and stays steady.  Use the same step for parking lights only.  5.5.1.16.   To turn BO lights on; press the “B.O. Drive” button then press “Enter” while flashing until light illuminates.  Use same step for B.O. marker lamps.  5.5.1.17.   To turn any light system off, press the “All Off” button then press “Enter” while flashing until no lights are visible.  5.5.1.18.   Check steering for excessive play.  5.5.1.19.   Test  horn.    Note:    Horn  will  not  operate  unless  the  service  drive  button  is activated.  5.5.1.20.   Check windshield wipers and washers.   5.5.2.  Automatic transmission control.  The MRAP automatic transmission has neutral (N), reverse (R) and five forward gear positions.  5.5.2.1.  Neutral.  The transmission resets itself to neutral when the engine is shut-off.  This position can be used if the vehicle stalls, in order to restart the vehicle.  Always ensure the vehicle has the parking brake set when using neutral.  5.5.2.2.  Reverse.  The vehicle needs to be at a complete stop prior to shifting to reverse to avoid damage to the transmission.  Due to the extreme visibility constraints associated with the MRAP, always use a spotter when backing.  5.5.2.3.  Abuse protection.  The transmission has built in protections against several types of abuse.  5.5.2.3.1.   The transmission will not shift from N to D to R if the drive shaft is moving.        5.5.2.3.2.   The transmission will not shift from N into (F) or R UNLESS the service brake is applied. 5.5.2.3.3.   When  a  lower  gear  is  selected  the  transmission  will  not  shift  to  that  gear until the vehicle slows to the speed range allowed for that gear. 5.5.2.3.4.   The transmission always shifts up or down through the gears sequentially. 5.5.2.3.5.   If R is pressed while the vehicle is moving, the transmission gear indicator window will flash R. 5.5.2.3.6.   If  the  vehicle  comes  to  a  stop  within  3  seconds,  the  transmission  gear indicator will shift into R and the flashing will stop.  5.5.2.3.7.   If the vehicle does not come to a stop within 3 seconds, the shift request will be ignored and the last drive number will be displayed. 5.5.2.3.8.   If D is pressed while the vehicle is moving backward, the transmission gear indicator window will flash D. 5.5.2.3.8.1.  If the vehicle comes to a stop within 3 seconds, the transmission gear indicator will shift into D and the flashing will stop.  5.5.2.3.8.2.  If the vehicle does not come to a stop within 3 seconds, the shift request will be ignored and R or N will be displayed on the transmission shift pad. 5.5.2.3.8.3.  If D is pressed while moving forward in any gear, the left digit on the transmission shift pad will display 5. 5.5.2.3.9.   When IGNITION switch is moved to RUN position, the transmission shift pad displays N.  See Figure 5.21. and Figure 5.22.    Figure 5.21.  Ignition Switch.   Figure 5.22.  Digital Display.    5.5.2.4.  Digital display.       5.5.2.4.1.   Direction of travel.  Press R or D on the transmission shift pad to choose direction of travel.  See Figure 5.23. below. 5.5.2.4.2.   Shift into neutral N whenever prolong idling is anticipated. 5.5.2.4.3.   The drive D ranges includes five forward gears. 5.5.2.4.4.   When idling with D selected, first gear is engaged.  Digital Display Panel will display the number 5 in the left position and one in the right position.  See Figure 5.23. Figure 5.23.  Direction of Travel.     5.5.2.4.5.   At  each  shift  the  number  in  the  right  position  will  change  to  display  the actual gear that the transmission is operating in.  5.5.2.4.6.   Figure  5.24.  shows  an  example  of  transmission  gear  ratios  and  the maximum speed for each gear.  Refer to the manufacturer’s operator’s manual for the specific MRAP type/model being operated.  Figure  5.24.    Transmission  Gear  Rations  and  Maximum  Speed  (varies  by  MRAP type/model).   5.5.3.  Manual shifting.  The automatic transmission can be manually shifted by pressing the up or down arrows on the transmission shift control pad.  See Figure 5.25.   Figure 5.25.  Manual Shifting.    5.5.3.1.  If the vehicle exceeds the maximum speed for a lower gear, use the brakes to slow vehicle until shift occurs.  5.5.3.2.  If  the  vehicle  is  moving  slower  than  the  minimum  speed  for  a  higher  gear, accelerate to increase speed until the shift occurs.  5.5.3.3.  The  transmission  will  stay  in  the  specific  gear  so  long  as  the  vehicle  is  at programmed speed range.  5.5.3.4.  If the vehicle exceeds the programmed range, the transmission will upshift and the right digit in the display will change to indicate actual gear.  5.5.3.5.  If  the  vehicle  speed  is  below  the  programmed  range,  the  transmission  will downshift and the right digit in the display will indicate the actual gear.  5.5.3.6.  When the vehicle is operating in a manually selected low gear, there are two ways to move to higher gears:  5.5.3.6.1.   The up arrow will move the transmission up one gear at a time.  Shifting will occur at programmed engine speed and load.  5.5.3.6.2.   Pressing  D  on  the  selector  pad  will  return  transmission  top  gear  range  to fifth  gear.    Transmission  will  shift  through  the  gears  according  to  programmed parameters.  5.5.4.  Standard operating mode.  5.5.4.1.  Rear wheel drive vehicle under normal conditions.  5.5.4.2.

The service brakes are air operated and controlled by an antilock braking system.  5.5.9.2.    Braking action is similar to automobile brakes.  However, the driver cannot feel braking force through the service brake pedal pressure.  5.5.9.3.    The distance the pedal is depressed determines the braking force applied by the air brake system.  The resistance felt by the driver is the same whether the brake is gently applied or fully engaged in a full emergency stop.  5.5.9.4.    Press brake pedal to apply brakes.  Transmission will downshift automatically.  5.5.9.5.  Exhaust brake.  The MRAP is equipped with an exhaust brake which operates by closing a butterfly valve within the exhaust system just after the turbocharger.  This creates back pressure on the engine and drive train and inhibits power production.  5.5.9.5.1.   Do not use the exhaust brake in rain or any other slippery conditions.  Use of the exhaust brake under these conditions may cause skidding and possible loss of vehicle control.      5.5.9.5.2.   When  using  the  exhaust  brake,  the  brake  lights  do  not  illuminate.    An accident  may  occur  if  another  vehicle  is  closely  following  and  does  not  realize  the vehicle is braking. 5.5.9.5.3.   To activate the exhaust brake: 5.5.9.5.3.1.  Press the top of the Exhaust Brake rocker switch.  5.5.9.5.3.2.  Easing off of the accelerator activates the exhaust brake. 5.5.9.5.3.3.  The AUXILIARY BRAKE warning light on the light panel turns on.  See Figure 5.34. below. Figure 5.34.  Exhaust Brake/Light Panel.   5.5.9.5.4.   To disengage exhaust brake:    5.5.9.5.4.1.

Winch operations.  5.5.18.1.   Follow  the  steps  below  to  ensure  safety  and  recovery  of  the  winch  during operation:  5.5.18.1.1.  Check  the  capacity  of  the  winch.   The  capacity  shown  on  the manufacturers’  plate  is  the  maximum  with  one  layer  of  cable  on  the  drum.    Each additional layer  increases the  diameter of the drum  and decreases the capacity to  as little as 50 percent.  5.5.18.1.2.  Check the cable for rust, kinks, or frays.      5.5.18.1.3.  Estimate  the  total  resistance.    Consider  all  factors  that  would  affect  the winch and the  item it will be pulling. 5.5.18.1.4.  Check the equipment.  Be sure to rig safely to overcome the resistance with the  equipment available. 5.5.18.1.5.  Select or provide a suitable anchor. 5.5.18.1.6.  Rig and check rigging.  Do not put power on the winch until after checking every element in  the rigging and are satisfied that there are no mistakes. 5.5.18.1.7.  Clear personnel from the danger area.  All personnel standing observing the operation  should stand outside the angle formed by the cable under stress at a distance.  Clear all  personnel away before tightening the cable.  5.5.18.2.   Single-vehicle winch operations.  5.5.18.2.1.  If the vehicle been dispatched alone and gets into a spot where its traction is  not enough to get  through,  the operator will need to use the winch and a suitable right to pull the vehicle through.  5.5.18.2.2.  Vehicle with winch:  Select or construct a strong anchor.  Attach a snatch block to the anchor with the tow chain, run the winch cable through the block and back to the truck.  (See Figure 5.41.)  Take up the slack gradually and pull the truck forward with its winch.  Power may be applied to the wheels at the same time.  Refer to the vehicle  manufacturer’s  operator’s  manual  for  additional  details  on  the  operating  the vehicle and winch.    Figure 5.41.  Vehicle Winching.   5.5.18.3.   Two-vehicle winch operation.   5.5.18.3.1.  Mechanical advantage is  gained by using a mechanism to  transmit force.   Small  force,  when  moves  through  a  long  distance  by  one  or  more  mechanisms (pulleys),  will  move  a  large  weight  (vehicle)  for  a  short  distance.    Use  one  of  the following  procedures when rigging for greater mechanical advantage.  5.5.18.3.1.1.  Two-part line:  This hookup gives a 2:1 advantage (see Figure 5.42.).  Attach a snatch block to the load.  Next, run the winch cable through the block and secure the cable to the winch vehicle.  Place a log in front of the towing vehicle to help hold its ground. 5.5.18.3.1.2.  Three-part line:  To get a mechanical advantage of 3:1, use two snatch blocks- one at the load and one on the winch vehicle (see Figure 5.42.).  Thread the winch cable first through the block on the load, back through the block on the winch and then again to the load where it is secured. 5.5.18.3.1.3.  Four-part  line:    This  gives  the  Operator  a  4:1  advantage.    Use  two snatch blocks- a double-sheave block for the load and s single-sheave block for the winch vehicle (see Figure 5.42.).  Thread the winch cable through one sheave of the double block attached to the load, back through the single- sheave on the winch vehicle and again to the load through the second sheave of the double block.  Finally secure it to the winch vehicle.    Figure 5.42.  Two Vehicle Winch Operations.    5.5.19.  Jump/slave starting operations.  5.5.19.1.   A  slave  cable  is  one  large  cable  that  is  connected  from  one  running  NATO vehicle (i.e. “Deuce” etc.) to the dead vehicle.  There is no positive and negative  post like commercial vehicle class type.    Just hook up one end of the slave  cable to the running vehicle and the other end to the dead vehicle and jump similar to normal vehicles.   The slave cables should have 24 prongs attached under  the plug.  It plugs into the back end of any M series vehicle and is a 24 volt  connection.  Note:  The slave cables are used for NATO vehicles only.  5.5.19.2.   Position slaving vehicle and disabled vehicle close enough for cable hookup.  5.5.19.3.   Stop slaving vehicle engine.  5.5.19.4.   Remove cover from slave receptacle of disabled vehicle and slaving vehicle.  5.5.19.5.   Warning - Ensure all battery cables in disabled vehicle are properly connected before connecting  slave cable.  Damage to batteries, cables or serious injury to personnel may result from  improperly connected batteries  5.5.19.6.   Caution  -  Use a twisting motion  when  installing slave  cable  to  the receptacle.  Forcefully  pushing  the  cable  onto  the  receptacle  may  cause  damage  to  the  receptacle mount.  Note:  Ensure all electrical switches in both vehicles are turned-off.  5.5.19.7.   Connect slave cable to the slave receptacle of both vehicles.  5.5.19.8.   Start slaving the vehicle engine.  5.5.19.9.   Start the disabled vehicle engine.  5.5.19.10.  After engine starts, disconnect slave cable from both vehicles.  5.5.19.11.  Install receptacle covers on both vehicles.  Note:    For  easy  removal,  apply  hand  cleaner  on  the  inside  of  the  cover  before  installing  the receptacle covers.  5.5.20.  Gunner’s platform operation.  5.5.20.1.   Before-operation:  5.5.20.1.1.  Depress two lock buttons on  locking pins  and remove locking pins  from locking  lugs  and  holes  securing  platform  in  stowed  position.    Grasp  hand  hold  on platform to lift platform to either half-height position or full-  height position.  If half-height position is required, lift platform all the way  up, and turn two latches so that ledges of latches are facing up and parallel  to bottom edge of platform.  5.5.20.1.2.  Lower the platform and allow it to rest on the ledges of latch at half-  height position.  Insert locking pins through forward locking holes in  platform and holes in platform  risers.    If  full-height  position  is  required,  lift  platform  to  the  full-height position, and ensure that rear locking holes in  left and right sides of platform are aligned with locking holes in platform  risers.  Insert locking pins through rear locking holes in platform and holes  in platform risers.  5.5.20.2.   After-operation:  5.5.20.2.1.  Remove  locking  pins  securing  platform  in  either  half-height  position  or full-height position  by pressing lock buttons and removing locking pins.    Lift up on platform and turn two latches so that ledges of latch are  facing downward, parallel to floor.  5.5.20.2.2.  Lower platform to stowed position, and align locking holes with  locking lugs.  Insert locking pins through locking holes and lugs.  5.5.21.  Runflat operations.  The vehicles are equipped with runflat tires, allowing the vehicle to be driven with one or two tires flat.  For runflat operations, refer to Table 5.4.  Table 5.4.  Runflat Operations.  Combination of Flat  Tires Two tires flat- rear One tire flat- any location Two tires flat- same side Two tires flat-front only  Recommended Vehicle  Speed 35 mph max. 35 mph 35 mph 35 mph Distance 30 mi (48 km) 30 mi (48 km) 30 mi (48 km) 30  i (48 km) Note:  WARNING - Do not exceed 35 mph during any runflat operations.  Do not exceed 20 mph (32 kph)  with both rear tires flat.  Do not operate the vehicle for more than 30 miles.  5.5.21.1.   Speeds indicated  in  Table  5.4.  are the  maximum  speeds  and  must  be  reduced when  traveling on secondary roads, cross- country, or in traffic.  Failure to reduce speeds could  cause loss of control of vehicle causing damage to equipment and injury or death to personnel.  5.5.21.2.   When driving a vehicle existing conditions are constantly changing.  Never drive at  a  speed  greater  than  is  reasonable  and  prudent  for  these  conditions.   Loss  of  vehicle control  may occur, causing damage to equipment and injury or death to personnel.   Note:    WARNING  -  A  wheel  that  has  been  ran  flat  must  be  replaced  and  inspected  by  unit maintenance as  soon as possible before reuse, or damage to equipment may result.  5.5.21.3.   Run flat operation may cause the tread to separate from the tire and/or wheel.  If abnormal handling is experienced or noise such as flapping or pounding around the  wheel well occurs, the tread needs to be cut away from the wheel before continuing  operation.  Failure to do so could result in damage to the vehicle.  Section 6—EXPLANATION AND DEMONSTRATION  6.1. Instructor’s Preparation.  6.1.1.  Establish a training location.  6.1.2.

If the vehicle has hydraulic brakes, pump the brake pedal three times. Then apply firm pressure to the pedal and hold for five seconds. The pedal should not move.  If it does, there may be a leak or other problem. Brake system. Test parking brake. Fasten safety belt. Set parking brake (power unit only). Release trailer parking brake (if applicable). Place vehicle into a low gear. Gently pull forward against parking brake to make sure the parking brake holds. Repeat the same steps for the trailer with trailer parking brake set and power unit parking brakes released (if applicable). If it doesn't hold vehicle, it is faulty; get it fixed. Test service brake stopping action. Go about 5 miles per hour. Push brake pedal firmly. "Pulling" to one side or the other can mean brake trouble. Any unusual brake pedal "feel" or delayed stopping action can mean trouble. If the trainee finds anything unsafe during the Vehicle inspection, get it fixed. Federal and state laws forbid operating an unsafe vehicle. Check vehicle operation regularly: Instruments. Air pressure gauge (if the vehicle has air brakes). Temperature gauges. Pressure gauges. Ammeter/voltmeter. Mirrors. Tires. Cargo, cargo covers. Lights, etc. o   If the trainee sees, hears, smells, or feels anything that might mean trouble, he/she should check it out. Safety inspection. Document any discrepancy on AF Form 1800.  Sign-off AF Form 1800 to signify accomplishment of inspection.   Figure A4.2.  Additional Steps for Inspecting Air Brakes System.  Additional Steps for Inspecting Air Brakes Step 2.  Engine Compartment Checks 5.  Walk-Around Inspecting 7.  Final Air Brake Check   o o o o  o o o o  o o o o o  o o Procedure Check air compressor drive belt condition and tightness (if compressor is belt driven). Check manual slack adjusters on S-cam brakes.  Note:  Vehicles with automatic slack adjustors still must be checked. Park on level ground and chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes so the operator can move the slack adjusters. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that it can be reached. Check brake drums (or discs), linings, and hoses. Test low pressure warning signal. Shut the engine off when the vehicle has enough air pressure so that the low pressure warning signal is not on. Turn the electrical power on. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce air tank pressure. Low air pressure warning signal should come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank with lowest pressure. Check that the spring brakes come on automatically. Chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes when enough air pressure is built up. Shut the engine off. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce the air tank pressure. "Parking brake" knob should pop out when the air pressure falls to the manufacturer's specification. Check rate of air pressure buildup Refer to manufacturer’s recommendation for average buildup time. If not within recommended time, the air pressure may drop too low during driving operations. Test air leakage rate.  o  With a fully-charged air system (typically 125 psi). o o o o  o o  o o o o o o       Turn-off the engine. Release the service brake and time the air pressure drop. The loss rate should be less than 2 psi in one minute for single vehicles. Not less than 3 psi in 1 minute for combination vehicles. Then apply 90 psi or more with the brake pedal. After the initial pressure drop, if the air pressure falls more than 3 psi in 1 minute for single vehicles. Not more than 4 psi for combination vehicles. Check air compressor governor cut-in and cut-out pressures. Air compressor should start at about 100 psi and stop at about 125 psi. Run the engine at a fast idle. Air governor should cut-out the air compressor at about the manufacturer's specified pressure. Engine idling, step on and off brake to reduce air tank pressure. Compressor should cut-in at manufacturer's specified cut-in pressure. Test parking brake:  Stop the vehicle; put the parking brake on; gently pull against it in low gear to determine if parking brake will hold. Test service brakes. Wait for normal air pressure. Release the parking brake. Move the vehicle forward slowly (about 5 mph). Apply the brakes firmly using the brake pedal. Note any vehicle "pulling" to one side, unusual feel, or delayed stopping action.
