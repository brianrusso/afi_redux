Program Concept:1.1. The Program is a reciprocal exchange of non-extended active duty Guard and Reserve officersand military reserve officers of selected foreign nations, as agreed to by parent services and govern-ments.

When a Guard or Reserve officer to beexchanged has no qualified and available counterpart in the host nation's Air Force (or none exists inthe Guard or Reserve for a foreign officer), an exchange of comparable officers may be considered.Comparable officers are similar in rank and skills, if not in duties.  If no comparable officers are avail-able, a nonreciprocal ("one-way") exchange may be considered.1.3. Assignment of Guard and Reserve officers to a position in a host nation's ground or sea-service,or assignment of foreign ground or sea-service officers to CONUS-based Guard or Reserve units willbe considered if no Air Force counterpart positions are available, and if the purpose of the exchange isto enhance mutual understanding of combined operations.2.

Program Coordinators will consider the fol-lowing criteria in evaluating requests to establish or revalidate exchange positions:5.1. Possible politico-military advantages to other nations and national security interests of theUnited States.5.2. Potential usefulness of exchange officers within the Guard or Reserve and the foreign militaryservice.5.3.

Exchange Reserve Officer Command and Supervisory Responsibility .  Subject to any limitationin the host or parent nation’s laws, Exchange Reserve Officers exercise supervisory responsibilities simi-lar to those exercised by an officer of the host service employed in a similar position.  They receive thesame rights and privileges afforded host air force officers of equivalent grade and rank, to the extentauthorized by the host nation’s laws.

The legal status of an Exchange Reserve Officer from a NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member country that is a party to the NATO Status of ForcesAgreement (SOFA) is governed by that agreement.  In such cases, the MOU should include provisionconfirming application of the NATO SOFA.  The legal status of Exchange Reserve Officers in the UnitedStates from nations not party to the NATO SOFA should be covered in the MOU by providing reciprocalprivileges for Exchange Reserve Officer to the extent authorized by host nation law (e.g. exemption fromhost nation customs duties and income taxes).8.

In event of involve-ment of the host service’s parent government in hostilities, or preparation for imminent hostilities,Exchange Reserve Officers will terminate their duties until further instructions are received from theirparent government.  In no case will the host government allow an Exchange Reserve Officer to beassigned to duty in areas of hostilities, imminent hostilities, or any other situation where the officer’s pres-ence could jeopardize the interests of either government.  Exchange Reserve Officers will also not per-form any type of armed alert or guard duty.9. Disclosing US Classified Military Information:9.1. The host service commander or supervisor of the Exchange Reserve Officer will determine thelevel of security access required by the officer, if any.

US security clearances are not granted to foreign Exchange Reserve Officers, however tempo-rary access may be granted upon advance presentation by the parent government of an appropriateindividual security clearance.  Access to NOFORN (No foreign dissemination-type caveated material)is prohibited unless the material is specifically marked as releasable to the foreign officer’s nation.Exchange Reserve Officers must comply with DoD Regulation 5200.1-R/AFI 31-401, Managing theInformation Security Program, for requirements in safeguarding US classified military information.Address any security-related questions to SAF/MIR.9.3. The Program Coordinator will inform the Guard or Reserve officer of any security requirements-.with the host service, and if required, ensure that the officer’s individual security clearance isreceived by the host government without delay. The Exchange Reserve Officer at all times will com-ply with the security laws, publications and procedures of the host government and military service.10.
