The purpose of this instruction is to provide Air Force guidance and direction for the  planning,  execution,  and  assessment  of  USAF  air  advising  activities  and  operations  with partner  nations.    The  objective  is  to  harmonize  and  synchronize  the  wide  range  of  USAF  air advising activities and operations in order to better achieve US national strategic objectives. 1.2.  General. 1.2.1.  Air advising is an Air Force capability that may be utilized  throughout the full range of  military  operations  in  support  of  combatant  commander  (CCDR),  commander  Air  Force forces  (COMAFFOR),  or  theater  special  operations  command  (TSOC)  objectives.    Air advising can create tactical-, operational-, and strategic-level effects. 1.2.1.1.  Air  Advising  Activities.    For  the  purpose  of  this  instruction,  air  advising activities  are  defined  as  security  cooperation  efforts  conducted  in  support  of  CCDR and/or COMAFFOR/TSOC objectives across the range of military operations. 1.2.1.2.  Air advising activities and operations include, but are not limited to, bilateral and multilateral meetings between senior leaders; subject-matter expert exchanges; exercises and competitions; mobile training team  (MTT)  and extended training service specialists (ETSS)  deployments;  global  health  engagements;  agile  combat  support  engagements; ANG State Partnership Program (SPP) engagements with partner nations; and operations in support of request for forces (RFF) taskings.  Note:  The term “air advising activities” will be used to represent both air advising activities and operations for the remainder of this instruction. 1.2.1.3.  Air  advising  activities  are  conducted  under  the  auspices  of  various  security cooperation initiatives and programs, including building partner capacity (BPC), security force assistance (SFA), foreign internal defense (FID), security sector reform (SSR), and support to security assistance. 1.2.1.3.1.  Examples  of  Title  10,  United  States  Code  (USC)  security  cooperation programs include: 1.2.1.3.1.1.  Overseas Disaster Relief/Humanitarian  Demining  Assistance.

The  Chief  of  Mission  (COM)  is  an  important  stakeholder  in  air  advisor activities,  as  his/her  concurrence  is  required  prior  to  all  air  advising  activities  with  a partner  nation.    COM  objectives  for  the  partner  nation  are  addressed  in  CCDR  and COMAFFOR/TSOC  country  plans  at  the  operational  level.    Air  advisor  plans  at  the tactical level support these DOD/USAF country plans. 1.2.2.  Total  Force  Airmen  assigned  to  conduct  air  advising  activities  may  reside  in designated air advisor forces/units or the expeditionary conventional forces (CF). 1.2.2.1.  Expeditionary  GPF  air  advisors  may  include  individuals  tasked  to  meet  Global Force  Management  Allocation  Plan  (GFMAP)  requirements,  individuals  tasked  to  meet emerging requirements, or individuals deployed through ad-hoc sourcing solutions. 1.2.2.2.  AEF  air  advisors  are  deployed  within  a  unit  or  as  individuals  to  meet  CCDR requirements  through  the  Global  Force  Management  (GFM)  allocation  process.    This includes  rotational  force  allocation  supporting  annual  requirements  and  unit  emergent force requirements for crisis response based on RFF or requests for capabilities (RFC). 1.2.2.3.  Air  advisors  also  deploy  as  individuals  for  rotational  or  emergent  RFF/RFC requirements and annual or out-of-cycle request for Joint Task Force (JTF) Headquarters (HQ) Individual Augmentee manpower through the Joint Manpower Document process. 1.2.2.3.1.  Advisors  may  also  deploy  individually  as  a  non-standard  or  ad-hoc sourcing  solution  to  conduct  advising  activities  in  support  of  CCDR,  subunified combatant  command,  or  JTF  requirements.    These  type  air  advisor  deployment lengths vary from normal AEF rotations to as much as 365-days.  Non-standard or ad-hoc  sourced  air  advisors  are  aggregated  in  the  deployed  location  in  a  variety  of possible organizations including, teams, detachments, and/or expeditionary units. 1.2.3.  Title  22  programs  such  as  IMET,  FMF,  and  associated  FMS,  are  part  of  the Department  of  State  (DOS)  foreign  operations  budget.    Air  advisors  may  execute  Title  22 funded missions as part of an MTT or as an individual deployment. AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015   7  1.2.4.  MTT.    For  the  purpose  of  this  instruction,  MTTs  are  defined  as  military  service personnel  or  contractor  personnel  performing  under  a  non-personal  services  contract  on temporary duty for the purpose of training foreign personnel in the operation, maintenance, or  support  of  weapon  systems  and  support  equipment  or  for  specific  training  requirements and  specific  capabilities  that  are  beyond  in-country  US  resources.  The  MTT  deploys  under one  of  the  security  assistance  authorities  in  Title  22  or  one  of  the  Title  10  authorized programs  that  follow  security  cooperation  procedures.  The  MTT  may  be  authorized  for Continental  United  States  (CONUS)  or  overseas  deployment  when  it  is  more  practical  to bring  the  training  capability  to  country  personnel.    An  MTT  should  be  considered  when training must be accomplished quickly in response to a threat or adverse condition affecting the security of the country; training is of relatively short duration, must reach a large number of trainees, and entails extensive use of interpreters or language-qualified team members; or training  can be  conducted only  on equipment or  in  facilities located in  the foreign country.  Note:  The  Air  Force  Security  Assistance  Training  (AFSAT)  Squadron  MTTs  may  not require training in accordance with AFI 10-4201, Volume 1 (V1), Air Advisor Education and Training,  dependent  on  size  of  team,  mission  environment,  total  length  or  purpose  of  the deployment.    Currently  AFSAT  managed  MTTs  are  not  tasked  to  meet  GFMAP  or  other non-standard requirements. 1.3.  Key  Definitions  and  Terms.

Mission Description 3.1.1.  The  overall  goal  of  air  advising  is  to  support  US  strategic  objectives,  GCC  theater strategies, and TCPs by assisting partner nations in the development and sustainment of their aviation enterprises.  Air advising activities can occur inside partner nations or in the US and consist of USAF personnel interacting with partner nation personnel.  These interactions span a wide range of events and include activities such as addressing technical skills on the flight line; understanding and integrating space and cyberspace capabilities; learning and exercising operational  skills  in  the  command  center;  conducting  flying  operations  with  partner  nation forces in foreign or US aircraft; and teaching managerial skills at a headquarters or other staff levels. 3.2.  Types  of  Engagements.  Air advising activities can support various types of engagements and  are  designed  to  accomplish  specific  objectives.    The  following  types  are  illustrative  of  the wide range of engagements,  each designed to  address  some aspect  of the aviation  enterprise of the  partner  nations  and  tailored  to  the  specific  needs.    To  maximize  the  impact  to  the development of a partner nation’s aviation enterprise, air advising activities should be part of a persistent  presence  with  focused  engagements  by  trained  USAF  personnel  over  a  number  of years. 3.2.1.  Building Partnerships/International Relationships.  This type of engagement is focused on building relationships and rapport with partner nation personnel.  These engagements can include initial  “door-opening”  activities  and  periodic  military-to-military  discrete engagements  at  either  a  senior-level  or  subject  matter  expert  level  to  address  specific  areas within the aviation  enterprise.  This  type of engagement  can facilitate US access  to  partner nation  facilities  required  during  both  peacetime  and  contingency  operations.    Finally, maintaining these relationships over time can further US strategic interests as partner nation personnel become senior leaders of their military or government. 3.2.2.  Building  Partner  Capabilities/Capacities.    This  type  of  engagement  is  focused  on increasing the capabilities and/or capacities of the partner nation’s aviation enterprise.  This type  of  engagement  can  include  a  wide  range  of  activities,  from  developing  the  basic infrastructure  and  support  systems  of  an  aviation  enterprise  to  training  partner  nation personnel  to  perform  military  aviation  missions  such  as  airlift  and  personnel  recovery.  However, activities should be tailored to the needs and the capabilities of the partner nation, based  on  economic,  infrastructure,  and  human  capital,  to  ensure  the  partner  nation  can operate and sustain their capabilities. 3.2.3.  Joint Training and Interoperability.  This type of engagement is focused on joint and coalition training that can lead to increased interoperability among joint and coalition forces. Examples  of  this  type  of  engagement  are  bilateral  and  multilateral  exercises  and competitions,  joint  combined  exchange  training  missions  conducted  by  SOF,  and  the involvement of forward-stationed forces, teams, and individual liaison officers that train and operate with international allies and partners on a daily basis.    18  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015 3.3.  Team Composition. 3.3.1.  Provider  Organizations.    Air  advising  teams  can  be  formed  from  designated  air advisor  forces/units  or  formed  on  an  as-needed  basis  from  organizations  with  the  required expertise.    Air  advising  units  may  be  established  in  theater  (such  as  the  air  expeditionary wings previously established in Iraq and Afghanistan) or in the CONUS (such as the 571 and 818 MSAS).  Additionally, they may have established unit type codes that can be used as-is or tailored to the specific mission requirements.  Air advising teams deployed within the AEF may be composed of personnel from one or more organizations, and consist of AFSOF, AF GPF, other services, and coalition personnel, trained for the air advising activity. 3.3.1.1.  For information on air advising team and unit organizational structures reference AFTTP 3-4.5, Air Advising. 3.3.2.  Personnel/Size.    GPF  and  SOF  air  advising  teams  are  generally  cross  functional, task/mission  oriented,  and  comprised  of  personnel  proficient  in  a  wide  variety  of    AF Specialty  Codes.    Capability  to  achieve  specific  mission  requirements  and  the  potential operating  environment  (i.e.,  permissive  to  hostile/uncertain)  are  key  factors  in  personnel selection.  The team lead or mission commander will ensure the required team composition meets  minimum  mission  and  operational  requirements  (T-1).    Total  team  size  is  mission dependent but also must remain within partner nation expectations, agreements, and specific approvals  (T-0).    Teams  may  have  capability  to  operate  in  a  self-contained  independent package,  to  include  force  protection,  or  as  a  dependent  package  that  requires  key  support from  the  SCO,  AF  Component  (C-MAJCOM/C-NAF)  (TSOC  for  SOF  teams)  while  in  the theater,  or  significant  reachback  support  from  outside  the  theater.    AFSOF  teams  are  task organized  as  Operational  Aviation  Detachments  (OADs)  and  tailored/sized  to  the  specific mission. 3.3.3.  Training.  Teams  may be augmented by members who are not specifically trained as air  advisors.    In  these  cases  sourced  and  sourcing  units  will  ensure  that  augmentees  meet requirements  commensurate with  mission objectives and  environment  (T-1). These training requirements will include those elements and tasks required for augmentees to integrate and operate  with  team  members  and  supported/partnered  elements.    In  order  to  improve  both response  times  to  CCDR  requirements  and  the  overall  quality  of  an  air  advisor  team, command  staffs  and  career  field  managers  should  work  together  to  provide  trained  and available personnel.  For mission planning and execution, team leads, mission commanders, and/or requirement owners may levy additional training. 3.3.3.1.  For designated and expeditionary air advisor forces/units, all air advisors will be trained in accordance with AFI 10-4201V1 (T-1). 3.3.3.2.  For CF Air Advisors, AFFOR staffs and SCOs will ensure the air advising team include  a  minimum  of  2  trained  air  advisors  or  10  percent  of  the  air  advising  team, whichever  is  greater  (T-1).    When  required,  round  up  to  nearest  whole  air  advisor;  for example, a team size of 25 requires 2.5 qualified advisors so the team lead should have 3 qualified or a waiver to execute with less. 3.3.3.3.  Theater  entry  and/or  country  clearance  requirements  may  dictate  other  training for air advising teams.  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015   19  3.4.  Synchronization of Air Advising Activities. 3.4.1.  Air advising activities should be planned as a series of continuing engagements with partner nations designed to meet long-term objectives.  Since air advising activities are part of the larger security cooperation program in the partner nation, they are planned, executed, and assessed in full coordination with SCO personnel and the US Embassy Country Team. 3.4.2.  Thorough planning and synchronization of all air advising activities in a partner nation is  critical,  to  include  AFSOC  CAA,  MSAS  air  advisors,  CRG  air  advisors,  and  SPP personnel.    To  meet  US  objectives  and  the  requirements  of  the  partner  nation,  air  advising activities  may  need  to  be  conducted  by  disparate  organizations,  and  possibly  by  multiple GCC  components.    The  AFFOR/TSOC  staff  works  with  the  SCO  personnel  to  assist  in coordinating  and  synchronizing  all  air  advising  activities  with  the  TSOC,  other  GCC components, and, as appropriate, with other AFFOR and MAJCOM staffs.  The objective is to  ensure  all  activities  are  mutually  supporting  and  complementary,  create  a  persistent engagement  relationship  with  the partner nation, and provide synergistic  effects  focused on the long-term strategies and objectives of the GCC.   20  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015 Chapter 4 AUTHORITIES FOR AIR ADVISING ACTIVITIES 4.1.  Overview 4.1.1.  All  DOD  interactions  with  international  partners  are  governed  by  specific  legal authorities, which in turn authorize, fund, and establish constraints on air advising activities.  Authorities used for air advising activities are subsets of authorities for security cooperation.  Authorities  may  have  expiration  dates;  therefore  Airmen  must  be  mindful  of  whether Congress  permits  a  temporary  authority  to  expire  or  chooses  to  extend  its  application  for  a longer period. 4.1.2.  In  addition  to  the  Congressional  authorization  for  an  activity,  Congress  must  also appropriate funds before the AF can execute the activity. 4.1.2.1.  Identifying  applicable  authorities  and  appropriations,  and  determining  the  most appropriate  ones  to  use,  can  be  complex  and  requires  careful  and  thorough  review  and planning  in  order  to  properly  facilitate  GFP  air  advising  activities  with  partner  nations.  AFFOR  staffs  coordinate  with  GCC  staff  and  Air  Force  legal  staff  to  determine  the appropriate  authorities  for  conducting  specific  air  advising  activities,  and  work  with SCOs and GCC staff to coordinate and obtain funding for these activities. 4.1.3.  In  all  situations  and  environments,  USAF  personnel  must  ensure  they  comply  with applicable US, foreign, and international law as they work to advance US strategic objectives (T-0).  Air  Force  personnel  should  seek  legal  advice  from  the  appropriate  Air  Force  legal office on available authorities and funding for proposed air advising activities. 4.2.  Basic Information 4.2.1.  Authorities available to conduct air advising activities are found in Title 10 or Title 22 of the US Code and in annual authorization acts. 4.2.1.1.  Title  10  –  DOD.    In  general,  DOD  appropriations  must  be  used  to  support  the operation  and  maintenance  of  United  States  forces  only.    However,  in  limited circumstances,  Congress  may  provide  specific  authority  for  DOD  to  utilize  a  limited portion  of  its  appropriated  funds  to  support  building  partner  capacity  functions.    To determine  whether  a  DOD  appropriation  is  authorized  for  a  proposed  air  advising activity, the specific legal  authority authorizing the proposed activity must  be identified (T-0).  Examples of specific authorizations are: 4.2.1.1.1.  Multilateral/Bilateral/Regional Cooperation (10 USC § 1051). 4.2.1.1.2.  Latin American Cooperation (10 USC § 1050). 4.2.1.1.3.  Section  2282  of  Title  10,  United  States  Code,  "Authority  to  build  the capacity  of  foreign  security  force"  authorizes  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  with  the concurrence of the Secretary of State, to  build partner nation national-level  capacity enabling foreign countries to conduct counterterrorism (CT) operations or to support on-going  allied  or  coalition  military  or  stability  operations  that  benefit  the  national security  interests  of  the  United  States.    (The  FY15  National  Defense  Authorization Act  [NDAA]  repealed  the  previous  section  1206  authority  [also  known  as  "Global AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015   21  Train and Equip Authority"] provided by the FY06 NDAA, as amended, and replaced it with section 2282, a new permanent authority.) 4.2.1.1.4.  Special Operations Forces Joint Combined Exchange Training (10 USC § 2011). 4.2.1.1.5.  Training of General Purpose Forces of the US Armed Forces with Military of Other Security Forces of Friendly Foreign Countries  (Section 1203, NDAA FY14, P.L.  113-66)  (This  temporary  authority  will  expire  on  September  30,  2017  unless Congress renews or extends this NDAA provision). 4.2.1.2.  Title 22 – DOS.  Title 22 outlines the roles and responsibilities of the DOS with respect  to  foreign  relations.    When  a  program  is  referred  to  as  a  Title  22  program,  it means  that  by  law,  DOS  maintains  overall  responsibility  for  the  program,  even  when administration of portions of the program is delegated to the DOD.  US military members performing  security  assistance  duties  authorized  by  Title  22  may  exercise  force  in  self-defense but do not participate in offensive combat operations (T-0). 4.2.2.  National  Guard  State  Partnership  Program.      Section  1205,  NDAA  FY14  authorizes the  National  Guard,  with  SecDef  approval,  DOS  concurrence,  and  Congressional notification, to establish a program of exchanges with foreign military forces, security forces, or  other  government  organizations  whose  primary  functions  include  disaster  response  or emergency  response.    This  temporary  authority  will  expire  on  September  30,  2016,  unless Congress renews or extends this NDAA provision.  NOTE:  Funds shall not be available for SPP for the participation of a member of the Guard in activities in a foreign country unless the member is on active duty orders under Title 10 at the time of such participation. 4.2.3.  Detailed information on available authorities can be obtained at the OSD Partnership Strategy  Toolkit  website  at  https://apps.osd.mil/sites/pstools/Pages/default.aspx;  contact SCToolsAdministrators@osd.mil  for  access  to  this  site.    However,  Air  Force  personnel should seek legal advice from the appropriate Air Force legal office on available authorities and funding for proposed air advising activities. 4.2.4.  Contractor  roles  in  the  process.    Agencies  must  ensure  that  inherently  governmental functions  are  reserved  exclusively  for  performance  by  Federal  employees  (military  or civilian).    Although  contractors  provide  important  support  to  the  agency,  they  may  not  be motivated solely by the public interest, and may be beyond the reach of management controls applicable to Federal  employees.   Agencies must further ensure that a sufficient number of Federal employees are dedicated to the performance and/or management of critical functions so that Federal employees can provide for the accomplishment of, and maintain control over, their  mission  and  operations.    Proper  identification  of  inherently  governmental  and  critical functions is the first step for meeting these requirements.   22  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015 Chapter 5 PERSONNEL SELECTION AND MANAGEMENT 5.1.  Personnel Selection. 5.1.1.  Attaining security cooperation objectives by/with/through a partner nation is critically dependent  upon  selecting  individuals  with  the  requisite  skills  to  ensure  success.    Since Airmen conducting air advising activities represent the USAF to partner nation personnel and are the “face” of the US to the partner nation, their qualifications should be screened as much as practicable during the selection process. 5.1.2.  For designated forces/units (i.e., MSAS, IAAFA, AFSOAWC, AAWC, AAA, among others)  the  Functional  Area  Manager  (FAM),  in  conjunction  with  the  gaining  organization, should  ensure  personnel  being  considered  for  designated  air  advisor  assignments  are screened  as  part  of  the  selection  process.    In  addition  to  standard  evaluation  areas,  such  as Officer  Performance  Reports/Enlisted  Performance  Reports,  functional  area  expertise,  etc., the following areas are considerations for selection: 5.1.2.1.  Volunteer for the Air Advisor career field 5.1.2.2.  Appropriate regional and cultural experience/understanding. 5.1.2.3.  Appropriate language proficiency. 5.1.2.4.  Supervisor/commander recommendation(s). 5.1.2.5.  Previous air advising experience or international relations experience. 5.1.2.6.  Previous air advisor education and training. 5.1.2.7.  Previous curriculum development, teaching or training experience. 5.1.3.  For  expeditionary  units,  personnel  being  considered  for  individual  air  advising activities  versus  designated  air  advisor  positions  should  also  be  screened  using  the  above criteria  as  a  guide  prior  to  selection.    Note:    MAJCOMs  will  apply  selection  criteria  to individuals  assigned  to  air  advising  duties  (for  both  designated  and  expeditionary forces/units). 5.2.  Personnel Tracking. 5.2.1.  Tracking air advising experience and air advisor education and training will enable the USAF to quickly identify trained/experienced personnel for future air advising assignments. 5.2.1.1.  Unit  commanders  or  designated  representatives  shall  assist  in  tracking  the education and training of military personnel  by awarding Special Experience  Identifiers (SEI)  to  qualified  air  advisors  (T-1).    Eligibility  for  a  Basic  or  Advanced  Air  Advising SEI is based on the completion of a formal air advisor training course, as defined in AFI 10-4201V1, Chapter 3, and a successful air advising mission.  Additional information on SEIs can be found in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), the  Air  Force  Officer  Classification  Directory/Air  Force  Enlisted  Classification Directory, and the Personnel Services Directory Guide. AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015   23  5.2.1.2.  Designated  forces/units  will  track  air  advising  missions  to  capture  individual experience and currency as required (T-3). 5.3.  Personnel Certification. 5.3.1.  Personnel  certification  should  be  accomplished  in  accordance  with  MAJCOM guidance. 5.4.  Readiness. 5.4.1.  The readiness status of organizations with designated air advisor manpower positions must be reported in the Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) (T-1).  All units that are required to report in SORTS will report on Mission Essential Task Lists (METLs) in Defense  Readiness  Reporting  System  (DRRS)  (T-1).    DRRS  measurement  criteria (METs/METLs) are the basis for capabilities-based readiness reporting.  Readiness reporting of these organizations will be accomplished in accordance with AFI 10-252.  The Air Force component A3 is responsible for the readiness of air advisor units.  AFSOF units will report readiness to USSOCOM IAW CJCSI 3210.06. 5.4.1.1.  The Air Force component A3 is responsible for the readiness of air advisor units. 5.4.2.  Organizations  with  designated  air  advisor  manpower  positions  will  include  air advising tasks in their core METLs (T-1).   24  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015 Chapter 6 PLANNING 6.1.  General.  Thorough and comprehensive planning is critical to ensuring the achievement of US national security strategy objectives in the most effective way possible.  In addition, nested and strategy-driven plans justify resources and enable operational assessment.  Airmen involved in  the  planning,  execution,  and  assessment  of  air  advising  activities  need  to  be  familiar  with CCMD  campaign  plans  and  COMAFFOR/TSOC  campaign  support  plans,  as  these  plans  link country plans and air advisor activities with national level strategy and objectives.  Country plans developed by the AFFOR staff or TSOC inform event and training/capacity plans developed by air advisors. 6.2.  Planning Guidance. 6.2.1.  In order to be successful, Airmen involved in air advising activities must be proficient in operational planning.  Formal training, professional military education, and experience are the  primary  means  to  acquire  proficiency  in  planning  air  advising  activities.    In  addition, there are a number of key planning references that Airmen planning, executing, and assessing air advisor activities should consult. 6.2.1.1.  Air Force doctrine Annex 3-0, Operations and Planning.  This annex provides a high-level  overview  of  strategy,  operational  art,  operational  design,  effects-based approach to operations, and assessment. 6.2.1.2.  Air Force doctrine Annex 3-22, Foreign Internal Defense.  This annex provides more information on air advising and air advising direct and indirect support planning. 6.2.1.3.  Air  Force  Tactics  Techniques  and  Procedures  (AFTTP)  3-4.5,  Air  Advising.  This document amplifies AFTTP 3-2.76, Advising, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques and Procedures for Advising Foreign Force, and provides advisors with tactical guidance on assisting  partner  nation  air  forces  to  build,  sustain,  and  implement  air  power  capacities and build their aviation enterprise in support of national policies. 6.2.1.4.  AFI  10-421,  Operations  Planning  for  the  Steady-State.    This  AFI  implements AFPD  10-4,  Operations  Planning:    Air  &  Space  Expeditionary  Force,  and  provides guidance  on  strategy  development,  planning,  execution,  and  assessment  in  support  of steady-state  military  operations,  to  include  security  cooperation.      It  includes  guidance related  to  the  COMAFFOR  CSP,  COMAFFOR  country  plan,  event  plan,  and training/capacity plan. 6.2.1.5.  Joint  Publication  5-0,  Joint  Operation  Planning.    This  publication  reflects current  guidance  for  planning  military  operations  and,  as  a  keystone  publication,  forms the  core  of  joint  doctrine  for  joint  operation  planning  throughout  the  range  of  military operations. 6.2.1.6.  CJCSM and Responsibilities.    This  manual  sets  forth  policy,  procedures,  and  responsibilities  for  the preparation of strategies and campaign plans. 3130.01A,  Campaign  Planning  Policies,  Procedures AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015   25  6.2.2.  Baseline  assessments  are  a  critical  step  in  the  development  of  country,  event,  and training/capacity plans.   Specifically, the baseline assessment of military  objectives enables the development of an operational approach that clearly outlines a game plan to move from a baseline state to an end state. 6.2.3.  As in all operational plans, the establishment of military objectives is a critical step in the planning process.  Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives  enable  mission  execution  and  support  the  COMAFFOR/TSOC  operational assessment  process.    SMART  objectives,  when  defined  further  with  effects  and  tasks, provide  a  doctrinally-sound  framework  for  executing  and  assessing  air  advisor  activities.  Effects  are  supported  by  measures  of  effectiveness  (MOEs)  and  tasks  are  supported  by measures  of  performance  (MOPs).    These  measures  must  be  articulated  at  each  planning level (tactical, operational, theater-strategic) and referenced in air advisor after-action reports to enable the refinement of follow-on planning and engagements. 6.2.3.1.  AFFOR  and  TSOC  staffs  generate  MOE,  MOP,  and  metrics/indicators  to determine  if  air  advising  activities  support  the  achievement  of  defined  objectives.  Evaluation  products  use  the  MOEs  to  answer  the  question,  “Are  we  doing  the  right things? and MOPs to answer, “Are we doing things right?”  An expanded discussion of MOEs  and  MOPs  is  provided  in  JP  5-0,  and  Joint  Doctrine  Note  1-14,  Operation Assessment. 6.3.  Theater-Wide and Regional Plans (Theater-Strategic Level). 6.3.1.  AFFOR and TSOC staffs, in conjunction with the CCMD staff, individual SCOs, and country  teams,  accomplish  both  theater-wide  and  regional  planning.    Theater-wide  and regional  planning  follow  the  directions  contained  in  the  GCC  TCP  and  are  aligned  with requirements of the AFFOR or TSOC CSP. 6.3.1.1.  GCC Theater Campaign Plan (TCP).  The TCP is the GCC’s plan to accomplish strategic  or  operational  objectives  within  a  geographic  AOR.    This  plan  operationalizes the  CCDR’s  theater  strategy  and  translates  strategic  concepts  into  unified  actions.    The TCP  integrates  steady-state  activities,  which  include  ongoing  operations,  security cooperation, and other shaping or preventive activities.  Campaign plans focus on steady-state activities over the next two to five years, to include current and ongoing operations.  Contingency  plans  for  responding  to  crisis  scenarios  are  treated  as  branch  plans  to  the campaign plan. 6.3.1.2.  TSOC/COMAFFOR  Campaign  Support  Plan  (CSP).    The  TSOC/COMAFFOR CSP  is  an  operations  plan  at  the  theater-strategic  level,  summarizing  steady-state, component-specific operations in  support of the  CCDR TCP.  The TSOC/COMAFFOR CSP  operationalizes the TSOC/COMAFFOR strategy.  The scope and planning horizon of the CSP normally align with the TCP. 6.3.2.  AFFOR and TSOC staffs should be proactive in advocating for the development and sustainment of aviation enterprise capabilities and capacities within the theater that supports the implementation of the CCMD campaign plans. 6.3.3.  Regional  planning  is  accomplished  in  much  the  same  way  as  theater-wide  planning, but is focused on specific regions of a theater and is thus smaller in scope.  Regional planning can  be  used  to  address  objectives  that  are  specific  to  a  given  region,  such  as,  promoting   26  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015 regional  stability  and  assistance,  US-regional  cooperation,  and  interoperability  among  the partner nations in the region.  Regional planning allows for a more focused effort in areas of strategic importance to the US and may complement theater-wide planning. 6.4.  Security Cooperation Plans (Operational Level). 6.4.1.  Operational  level  planning  is  accomplished  in  coordination  with  the  CCMD  staff, SCOs,  SAF/IA,  and  individual  country  teams.    Country  planning  follows  the  direction contained in the GCC TCP, aligns with requirements of the AFFOR or TSOC CSP and the US Embassy Integrated Country Strategy (ICS). 6.4.1.1.  DOS  Integrated  Country  Strategy  (ICS).    ICS’s  are  three-year  DOS-developed country plans that serve as single, multi-year, overarching strategies that encapsulate US government policy priorities, objectives, and the means by which diplomatic engagement, foreign assistance, and other tools will be used to achieve national objectives.   The ICS codify  DOS  goals  and  objectives  across  the  spectrum  of  foreign  policy  areas  (e.g., security,  development,  health,  agriculture,  trade,  education,  etc.)  through  a  coordinated and  collaborative  planning  effort  at  the  country-level  and  are  flexible  enough  to accommodate  emerging  threats.    The  ICS  serves  as  the  core  organizing  document  for security  sector  assistance  (SSA)  efforts  in  each  country  and  will  inform  individual agencies’ SSA planning and budget requests. 6.4.1.2.  GCC Country Plan.  The country plan is the GCC’s primary tool to synchronize DOD  security  cooperation  operations  in  support  of  the  DOS  ICS.    The  initial  focus  of country planning should be on the GCC priority countries in the theater.   Other than the TSOC/COMAFFOR  country  plan,  the  GCC  country  plan  is  the  plan  most  applicable  to the air advisor. 6.4.1.3.  TSOC/COMAFFOR Country Plan.  The TSOC/COMAFFOR  country plan is  a security cooperation plan at the operational level that aligns with the GCC’s country plan and nests under the TSOC/COMAFFOR CSP.  These plans focus on achieving country-level  objectives  related  to  partner  relationships,  partner  capabilities  and  capacities, access,  and  interoperability.    The  TSOC/COMAFFOR  country  plan  is  the  plan  most applicable  to  the  air  advisor,  as  air  advisor-developed  tactical  plans  support  and  link  to the TSOC/COMAFFOR country plan.  The TSOC/COMAFFOR country plan: 6.4.1.3.1.  Identifies desired security roles the USAF would like the partner to play. 6.4.1.3.2.  Focuses  on  achieving  US  interests  and  aligns  with  the  intersection  of  US and partner objectives. 6.4.1.3.3.  Sequences activities, operations, events, and investments in time and space to achieve desired effects.  The most common security cooperation operations include military-to-military engagement, training, equipping, and exercises. 6.4.1.3.4.  Articulates  resource  requirements,  including  a  demand  signal  for  security cooperation programs and organizations. 6.4.1.3.5.  Provides justification for security cooperation funding regardless of source (Title 10, Title 22, etc.). 6.4.1.3.6.  Provides justification to request forces through the GFM system. AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015   27  6.4.1.3.7.  Should TSOC/COMAFFOR-developed contingency support plans. shaping 0 include phase actions associated  with 6.5.  Security Cooperation Plans (Tactical Level). 6.5.1.  Event  Plan.    The  event  plan  is  a  security  cooperation  plan  at  the  tactical  level, outlining objectives, concept of operations, and concept of support for an individual security cooperation  action  or  engagement,  hereafter  referred  to  as  an  event.    A  detailed  event  plan builds  the  linkage  between  the  tactical  action  (event)  and  the  COMAFFOR/TSOC operational-level  plan (country plan).  This  vertical  linkage is  vital  because it provides top-down purpose to the event and enables bottom-up operational assessment of the country plan and steady-state campaign plan.  The event plan: 6.5.1.1.  Is  a  detailed  security  cooperation  plan  for  a  specific  or  discrete  steady-state engagement. 6.5.1.1.1.  Must  take  into  account  and  comply  with  foreign  disclosure  guidance governing interactions with each individual international partner. 6.5.1.2.  Is an internal USAF plan focused on how USAF personnel will prepare, deploy, employ, redeploy, and assess the steady-state event.  For security cooperation events, the event plan is not shared with the partner nation. 6.5.1.3.  May  be  supplemented  with  a  subordinate  plan(s)  that  focuses  entirely  on  a partner nation (e.g., training plan, building capacity/capability plan, etc.). 6.5.1.4.  Articulates preparation, training, rehearsal, funding, equipment, force protection, logistics,  command  relationships,  and  other  requirements  necessary  for  event  execution and assessment. 6.5.1.5.  Is developed by any organization or individual formally tasked for the execution and assessment of a steady-state event. 6.5.1.6.  May  not  be  required  for  all  steady-state  events  due  to  the  event’s  importance, significance, scope, cost, etc. 6.5.1.7.  Must take into account and comply with public laws and authorities that govern interactions  with  international  partners.    This  is  especially  relevant  to  building  the capacity and capability of partner nations and security assistance events. 6.5.1.8.  May  be  executed  and  funded  using  a  variety  of  authorities  and  programs, including Title 10, Title 22, and others. 6.5.1.9.  Addresses  the  expected  duration  of  event  planning,  preparation,  execution, assessment, and after action reporting. 6.5.1.10.  Is  developed  using  an  effects-based  approach,  ensuring  events  support TSOC/COMAFFOR-established  strategy,  objectives,  effects,  and  tasks.    Event-level objectives  are  the  centerpiece  of  the  event  plan,  enabling  all  subordinate  planning  and assessment. 6.5.1.10.1.  Normally, event-level objectives support tasks in the TSOC/COMAFFOR country plan, and are developed by the planning organization in coordination with the TSOC/AFFOR staff.   28  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015 6.5.1.10.2.  Event-level objectives should be SMART. 6.5.1.10.3.  Event-level  objectives  baselines  should  be  established  prior  to  the development of an operational approach. 6.5.1.10.4.  Event  effects  describe  the  conditions  necessary  to  achieve  event objectives.  MOEs support the assessment of effects. 6.5.1.10.5.  Event tasks describe friendly actions to create effects.  MOPs support the assessment of tasks. 6.5.1.10.6.  Event plans are often organized by phases.  For illustration, a single event plan  may  include  phases  for  planning,  preparation,  site  survey,  baseline  assessment, deployment, employment, redeployment, assessment, and after action reporting. 6.5.1.10.7.  The ability to assess during plan execution should be incorporated into the plan at initial creation. 6.5.2.  Training/Capacity Plan.  A training/capacity plan is a security cooperation plan at the tactical level, outlining objectives, concept of operations, and concept of support for building partner capacity or capability.   In contrast  to  the event  plan that focuses on the specifics of how  Airmen  will  execute  and  assess  an  individual  engagement  event,  the  training/capacity plan is entirely focused on the partner nation.  It can be viewed as a very comprehensive and highly  detailed  project  management  plan  for  building  a  partner’s  capacity  or  capability.    A detailed  training/capacity  plan  implements,  from  a  building  partner  capacity/capability perspective,  the  applicable  portions  of  the  TSOC/COMAFFOR  country  plan.    The training/capacity plan: 6.5.2.1.  Is developed, executed, and assessed in collaboration with the partner nation. 6.5.2.2.  Is  developed  for  the  sole  purpose  of  building  a  specific  capacity  or  capability within a partner nation.  Multiple training/capacity plans may be necessary for a partner nation.  A single training/capacity plan may support multiple events. 6.5.2.3.  Is  developed  by TSOC/AFFOR staff. the  planning  organization in  coordination  with the 6.5.2.4.  May  require  the  integration  of  doctrine,  organization,  training,  materiel,  leader development and education, personnel,  facilities, and policy in order to build a capacity or capability. 6.5.2.5.  Is developed using an effects-based approach. 6.5.2.5.1.  Although  the  training/capacity  plan  may  be  included  as  part  of  an  event plan, the training/capacity plan primarily supports TSOC/COMAFFOR country plan objectives, effects, and tasks. 6.5.2.5.2.  Objectives  are  the  centerpiece  of  the  training/capacity  plan,  enabling  all subordinate planning and assessment. 6.5.2.5.3.  Objectives  should  be  SMART  and  developed  in  collaboration  with  the TSOC/AFFOR staff. 6.5.2.5.4.  Objectives baselines should be established prior to  the development  of an operational approach. AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015   29  6.5.2.5.5.  Effects  describe  the  partner  conditions  necessary  to  achieve  objectives.  MOEs support the assessment of effects. 6.5.2.5.6.  Tasks  describe  partner  actions  to  create  effects.    MOPs  support  the assessment of tasks. 6.5.2.5.7.  Training/capacity  plans  are  often  organized  by  phases.    For  illustration,  a single  training/capacity  plan  may  include  phases  for  defining  requirements, procurement,  fielding,  initial  operating  capability,  full  operating  capability,  and sustainment. 6.5.2.5.8.  The ability to assess during plan execution should be incorporated into the plan at initial creation. 6.5.3.  Organizations tasked to lead and plan the air advising activity should: 6.5.3.1.  Understand  the  purpose,  scope,  and  detailed  objectives  of  the  air  advising activity and how it links to US strategic planning objectives. 6.5.3.2.  Understand how the partner nation’s air force is organized, employed, supported, and integrated into the larger context of the partner nation’s national security strategy and US planning constructs. 6.5.3.3.  Understand  the  partner  nation’s  civil  aviation  capabilities  and  organizational structure, and obtain an awareness of how current and future civil aviation development could influence its aviation enterprise. 6.5.3.4.  Understand any previous and ongoing air advising activities in the partner nation and their relationship to the activity being planned. 6.5.3.5.  Ensure  all  planned  air  advising  activities  support  CCMD  TCPs  and  country plans. 6.5.3.6.  Incorporate  the  ability  to  assess  the  activity  during  plan  execution  during  plan development. 6.5.3.7.  Develop the plan using an effects-based approach. 6.5.3.8.  Define the required air advising resources—manpower, equipment, etc. 6.5.3.9.  Understand and take into account the ability of the partner nation to sustain the capabilities that the organization is tasked to develop. 6.5.3.10.  Coordinate  formal  and  informal  activity  details  with  the  AFFOR/TSOC  staff and with  the US  country team  in  the partner nation, e.g.,  Opening Ceremonies, Closing Ceremonies, and Ice Breakers. 6.5.3.11.  Obtain  strategic  communications  inputs  (Public  Affairs  guidance)  from  the AFFOR/TSOC staff and/or US country team. 6.5.3.12.  Understand Country Entry requirements per the Foreign Clearance Guide, and lead  times  associated  with  Aircraft  and  Personnel  Automated  Clearance  System,  Visas, etc. 6.5.3.13.  Plan for the personnel recovery requirements for each phase of the activities. 6.5.3.14.  Obtain foreign disclosure guidance and review from AFFOR/TSOC staff.   30  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015 Chapter 7 EXECUTION 7.1.  General.  Air  advising  activities  may  require  employment  of  all  facets  of  security cooperation  including  security  assistance,  SFA,  FID,  and  security  sector  reform.    Execution  of air advising activities focus on the execution of the event and/or training/capacity plan. 7.1.1.  Interagency Coordination.  Air advising activities are part of the unified actions of the GCC and require interagency coordination.  This coordination is led by the CCDR, but must be understood by all Airmen prior to the execution of the mission. 7.2.  Employment Factors.  Key factors that may affect mission execution include: 7.2.1.  Legal  authority/funding.    Air  advisors  will  consult  with  legal  counsel  to  ensure  they understand  the  legal  authorities  for  employment  and  the  funding  restrictions  that  limit  the conduct of the mission (T-1). 7.2.2.  Foreign  Disclosure  Limitations.    Only  designated  foreign  disclosure  officers  may approve  the  disclosure  of  classified  and  controlled  unclassified  military  information  to foreign  personnel.  Air  advisors  will  follow  foreign  disclosure  rules  and  regulations  (T-0).  USAF  personnel  must  ensure  compliance  with  AFI  16-201,  Air  Force  Foreign  Disclosure and  Technology  Transfer  Program  (T-0).    AFSOF  should  comply  with  appropriate USSOCOM directives. 7.2.2.1.  Disclosure  Involving  Equipment  Procurement  through  FMS,  Pseudo-FMS  or Other  Transfers.    Air  advisors  must  adhere  to  the  limits  of  information  transfer concerning specific equipment procured or transferred to  Foreign Security Forces (FSF) (T-0). 7.2.3.  Information  Operations  (IO)  Impact.    IO  is  a  key  consideration  at  all  levels  of execution.    Strategic  communications  plans  require  coordination  with  the  Public  Affairs office  at  the  appropriate  level  of  command  (i.e.,  SCO,  CCDR,  C-MAJCOM,  TSOC,  or  C-NAF).  Each air advisor should review all facets of information-related operations that may influence  or  affect  the  perceptions  of  the  partner  nation  population,  an  adversary,  or  the international community. 7.2.4.  Intelligence  Support.    Air  advising  activities  will  be  informed  by  intelligence assessments of partner nation and potential adversary capabilities, capacities, and shortfalls. 7.2.5.  Contract Support for Air Advising Activities.  If the activity involves contract support, such  as  maintenance  of  any  equipment  or  supplies,  ensure  a  Contracting  Officer Representative (COR) is  appointed and trained prior to  activity initiation.  Ensure the COR has basic knowledge pertaining to contract maintenance responsibilities and is able to reach back to the contracting officer for assistance. 7.2.6.  Anti-Terrorism/Force  Protection.    Consistent  with  Air  Force  doctrine  that  Airmen work for Airmen, the geographic COMAFFOR normally exercises administrative control of GPF air  advisor teams  for force protection (TSOC exercises operational  control of SOF air advisor  teams).    This  is  true  regardless  of  whether  the  air  advisors  are  assigned,  attached, aligned, or unaffiliated with the GCC.  The chief of mission and SCOs also play an important AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015   31  role in force protection, but the primary responsibility sits with the geographic COMAFFOR or  TSOC.    A  force  protection  annex  to  the  event  plan  is  an  effective  method  to  coordinate force protection with the regional AFFOR. 7.2.6.1.  Commanders,  mission  commanders,  and/or  team  leaders  are  responsible  for implementing  anti-terrorism/force  protection,  OPSEC,  COMSEC,  and  other  security measures, such as countering a potential insider attack threat, for the air advising activity or operation. 7.2.7.  Risk  Management.    Prior  to  execution  commanders,  mission  commanders,  and  or team leaders will conduct a risk management assessment and implement required mitigating measures (T-1). 7.2.8.  Personnel  Recovery  (PR).    Squadron  or  equivalent  commanders  will  ensure  PR preparedness of assigned forces and that emergency action plans/evasion plans of action are implemented as required IAW JP 3-50, Personnel Recovery, and COCOM guidance. 7.3.  Equipping the Air Advisor, Team, or Unit. 7.3.1.  The  AFFOR  staff  or  TSOC  responsible  for  the  theater  in  which  the  air  advising activity  will  take  place,  in  coordination  with  the  unit  tasked  to  support  the  mission,  is responsible  for  defining  the  equipment  requirements  for  the  team  and  providing  an equipment  list  to  team  members.    In  these  instances,  AFSOF  coordinates  with  TSOCs.  Minimum required equipment includes unique equipment specific to the air advising activity, individual protective equipment, and, if required due to mission/training objectives, weapons and ammunition. 7.3.2.  Required  equipment  is  provided  to  team  members  by  their  home  organization,  the SCO,  or  the  AFFOR/TSOC  staff  depending  on  travel  and  or  country  clearance  restrictions.  Specialized  equipment  that  requires  procurement  will  require  a  determination  of  the  most appropriate funding source based on the executive authority directing the mission (T-0). 7.4.  Command Relationships for Air Advising Teams. 7.4.1.  Air advising teams support the GCC and COM in the partner nation to which they are deployed;  the command relationships specified for the deployment supports this relationship. The advisor team’s specific chain of command and command relationships will be identified and  briefed  to  all  US  units,  organizations,  and  agencies  integrated  into  specific  security cooperation efforts utilizing air advisors or air advisor teams.  Under typical circumstances, military members part of an embassy team (i.e. SCO, MAG, etc), although coordinated with closely, are not part of advisor team’s chain of command.  Functional air advisor forces (i.e., MSAS)  conducting  activities  in  support  of  a  GCC/COMAFFOR  country  plan  are  not normally  allocated  to  the  CCDR  but  should  be  placed  “in  support”  of  the  geographic COMAFFOR.    In  this  case,  ADCON  (except  for  force  protection)  is  provided  by  the  Air Force organization retaining OPCON. 7.4.2.  COMAFFOR/TSOC  commander  ensures  appropriate  command  and  control relationships are established for applicable air advising teams, activities, and events in their respective  Area  of  Responsibility  (AOR).    Command  and  control  relationships  should  be clearly identified in the event plan.   32  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015 7.4.3.  Operational Control (OPCON) of GPF air advising teams is determined on a case-by-case  basis.    The  relationships  established  must  be  in  line  with  policies  and  procedures established  in  the  Global  Force  Management  Implementation  Guidance  and  in  the  Unified Command Plan.  These documents permit either transfer of OPCON to the supported GCC or retention  of  OPCON  by  the  supporting  command,  depending  on  the  situation.  TSOCs exercise OPCON of SOF. 7.4.3.1.  If  OPCON  is  transferred  to  the  GCC,  the  GCC  normally  delegates  OPCON  to the COMAFFOR/TSOC. 7.4.3.2.  If OPCON is not transferred to the GCC, the supported GCC and the geographic COMAFFOR  establish,  coordinate,  document,  and  provide  the  supporting  GPF  teams with specific policies and procedures related to command and control.  This guidance will help ensure a joint understanding of the tasks and the preferred processes to accomplish the tasks. 7.4.3.3.  The  applicable  Deployment  Order  (DEPORD)  specifies relationships for air advising forces tasked via the GFMAP. the  command 7.4.4.  The specific elements of ADCON of air advising teams is also determined on a case-by-case  basis.    When  applicable,  the  DEPORD  specifies  the  ADCON  of  teams  deployed through the GFMAP. 7.5.  Core  Task  Execution.  Core  task  execution  may  range  from  indirect  support  operations through direct support operations up to and including combat operations. 7.5.1.  All  air  advisors  must  operate  under  the  assigned  authority  granted  for  application  of each  core  task  (T-0).    If  during  the  execution  of  the  mission  it  becomes  apparent  that  the interaction may exceed that level, the air advisor must gain new operational guidance before exceeding the authority of the current operational task (T-0). 7.5.2.  Assessing  the  Partner  Nation.    An  air  advisor  lives  in  an  environment  of  continuous assessment.    Initially,  air  advisors  will  assess  a  partner  nation’s  aviation  capabilities  and limitations based on the specific tasks in response to the GCC requirements and the country. 7.5.3.  Training the Partner Nation.  Air advisors train partner nation military aviation forces to operate and sustain indigenous airpower resources and capabilities.  Training can provide a doctrinal  or  procedural  foundation  for  military  operations  and  activities.    Training  enables foreign  aviation  forces  to  accomplish  a  variety  of  airpower  functional  tasks,  roles,  and missions.  Instructional  programs  impart  employable  capabilities  ranging  from  technical skills, sustainment functions, and tactical flying skills.  Training can be used to close specific gaps in foreign skills and to raise the partner nation level of competency. 7.5.4.  Advising  the  Partner  Nation.    The  step  from  training  to  advising  crosses  a  political threshold requiring at a minimum, SecDef approval and potentially Presidential approval.  As explained  in  Air  Force  doctrine  Annex  3-22,  advice  can  include  advising  central  command elements of the host military on the capabilities, limitations, and correct use of airpower in a given  conflict.    Examples  include  providing  mission-related  advice  on  intelligence, maintenance, logistics, communications, and administration as well as tactical operations. 7.5.5.  Assisting  the  Partner  Nation.    Assist  operations  are  unique  and  may  be  authorized when  a  partner  nation  cannot  conduct  required  missions  or  contingency  operations  alone.  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015   33  Assist  operations  can  also  include  all  types  of  mission  and  operational  support  functions working in parallel to support the overall objective. 7.5.6.  Equipping  the  Partner  Nation.    From  training  through  assisting,  air  advisors  need  to understand the legal restrictions involved in equipping their partner nation.  It is imperative that  air  advisors  understand  they  are  not  authorized  to  transfer  any  equipment  and/or information to FSF not explicitly authorized in their mission orders (T-0). 7.5.6.1.  The transfer of  information,  files, copies or other documents must  be approved IAW paragraph 7.2.2. of this AFI and associated regulations.  Air advisor teams  should not assume that unclassified or unmarked information is transferrable. 7.6.  Miscellaneous Execution Support. 7.6.1.  Reachback Support. 7.6.1.1.  SCO  personnel,  in  coordination  with  the  GCC,  assisted  by  AF  Component  (C-MAJCOM/C-NAF)s,  should  function  as  the  central  point  of  contact  for  reachback support for GPF air advising teams within their country.  They work with MAJCOMs and other agencies and organizations as necessary to  provide the support required by the air advising team that is not available at the theater level. 7.6.1.2.  Detailed  procedures  for  obtaining  reachback  support  should  be  established  by the  SCO  and  AF  Component  (C-MAJCOM/C-NAF),  coordinated  with  all  participating reachback  organizations,  and  provided  to  members  of  the  air  advising  team  prior  to initiation of the activity. 7.6.1.3.  TSOCs  are  expected  to  function  as  the  central  point  of  contact  for  reachback support to SOF air advising teams deployed within their theater. 7.6.1.4.  MAJCOMs  provide  assistance  to  SCOs/C-MAJCOMs/C-NAFs  and  TSOCs  for reachback support not available at the theater level. 7.6.2.  Joint/Coalition  Organizations/Teams.    USAF  personnel  can  be  assigned  or  deployed as  part  of  a  joint/coalition  air  advising  organization  or  team.    In  this  situation,  USAF personnel should follow the policy and procedures established by the US commander of the organization or by the team lead. 7.6.3.  G-TSCMIS. 7.6.3.1.  All  steady  state  air  advising  activities  will  be  entered  and  tracked  through  G-TSCMIS. The organization with  primary responsibility for the  execution of an advising activity or operation is the event owner and responsible for entering data into G-TSCMIS (T-0).  Organizations that have air advising events unique to their organization will enter that event into the G-TSCMIS system (T-0).  A designated person within the activity or operation owns the event from initial data entry through assessment and closeout.  The G-TSCMIS Business Rules (Release 1) provides procedures for use of this system. 7.7.  Flying and Maintenance Operations. 7.7.1.  Flight Approval Authority.  GCC, COMAFFOR, or TSOC will retain flight approval authority on foreign aircraft for air advisor personnel as aircrew or passengers (T-1).  Refer to AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, for additional guidance on flying operations.   34  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015 7.7.1.1.  Flight  in  Foreign  Owned  Military  Aircraft.    An  appropriate  airworthiness assessment  of the  foreign  Military  Airworthiness  Authority  (MAA)  must  be accomplished  prior  to  allowing  Air  Force  passengers  (to  include  Service  members, civilians, and contractors) or aircrew on  foreign-owned military  aircraft (T-1).  Request airworthiness Office (usaf.airworthiness.office@us.af.mil)  and  provide information:  nationality, type, and scope of the operations to be performed (e.g. passenger movement, crew  involvement,  static  line  parachute,  rappel,  etc.)  and  the  due  date  of  the  required assessment. A positive assessment will result in ability to operate on that MAA’s aircraft for 4 years. Airworthiness following assessments the from the USAF 7.7.1.2.  If  the  USAF  airworthiness  office  responds  they  are  unable  to  conduct  the assessment,  AFFORs  or  18  AF  as  appropriate,  may  authorize  rated  officers  and  7-level maintenance personnel to conduct an operational appraisal of airworthiness risks utilizing the  checklist  provided  by  the  USAF  Airworthiness  Office.    This  checklist  is  located  on the  USAF  Air  Advisor  Sharepoint  site  at:    https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-OP-AF-95 (refer  to  Flight  in  Foreign-Owned  Aircraft  Implementation  Guidance).    The  risk  for  the mission  must  be  assessed  by  the  requesting  command  and  accepted  by  the  first  general officer/flag  officer  (GO/FO)  in  the  chain  of  command  for  military  personnel,  the supervisory  chain  for  civil  service  personnel,  and  by  the  organization  with  operational oversight  for  U.S.  DOD  contractors  involved.    Operational  appraisals  are  valid  for  the duration of the mission, and may be utilized to inform future risk assessments if validated as  current  and  applicable.    AFSOF  should  comply  with  appropriate  USSOCOM directives. 7.7.1.3.  Approval  for  flight  in  foreign  air  carrier  commercial  aircraft  is  addressed separately by DODI 4500.53. 7.7.1.4.  Safety  Assessment.    Along  with  the  airworthiness  of  the  aircraft,  a  safety assessment  of  partner  nation  aircrew  and  maintenance  currencies/qualifications  must  be accomplished (T-1). 7.7.2.  Operational  Guidance  for  Aircrew  Activity  with  Partner  Nations.    The  general provisions of AFI 11-series regulations are not  authoritative over partner nation owned and operated  aircraft.  When  specific  AFI  guidance  directly  refers  to  operations  in  non-USAF owned  aircraft,  that  guidance  must  be  adhered  to.  To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  air advisor  aircrew  operating  on  partner  nation  aircraft  will  use  AFI  11-series  regulations  as  a guide to safe and effective operations. 7.8.  After Action and Lessons Learned Reporting and Implementation. 7.8.1.  The  effectiveness  of  individual  air  advising  activities  and  the  overall  country  and theater-wide  plans  are  measured  and  documented  on  a  continual  basis  with  evaluations  at multiple  levels  within  the  air  advising  realm.    It  is  necessary  for  air  advisors  to  document observations  and  lessons  learned  to  support  the  cyclical  nature  of  air  advising:  planning, execution, and measuring effectiveness. 7.8.2.  All air advising activities conclude with an event AAR as defined specifically by the AFFOR  or  TSOC  staff.    The  report  articulates  the  degree  to  which  the  objectives  were satisfied.    Data  collection  associated  with  the  MOPs  and  MOEs  provide  support  to  the AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015   35  report’s  assessment.    AARs  shall  include  a  narrative  summary  of  observations,  lessons learned, and recommendations. 7.8.2.1.  Mission  commanders  or  team  leads  will  forward  an  after  action  report  to  the tasking organization.  The report should be submitted within fourteen days. 7.8.2.2.  The AAR  articulates the degree to  which the event  objectives were satisfied in reference to specified MOEs and MOPs (T-2). 7.8.2.3.  Mission commanders or team leads will ensure information is uploaded into G-TSCMIS for review by the event owning organization (T-0). 7.8.3.  Lessons  learned  reporting  will  be  completed  at  all  levels  as  appropriate  and  will  be uploaded into JLLIS as required (T-1).  AFI 90-1601, Air Force Lessons Learned Program, provides guidance on developing lessons learned.   36  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015 Chapter 8 ASSESSMENT 8.1.  General.  Assessment is a critical component to ensuring air advising activities are effective and  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  campaign  plan  objectives.    The  primary  purpose  of assessment is to enhance the commander’s decision making ability and increase the effectiveness of  operations  and  plans.    Assessment  is  a  key  component  of  the  commander’s  decision  cycle, helping  to  determine  the  results  of  actions  in  the  context  of  overall  mission  objectives  and providing  potential  recommendations  for  the  refinement  of  future  plans.    Assessment  is continuous;  it  precedes  and  guides  every  planning  or  operations  execution  activity  and  follows each operation or phase of an operation. 8.2.  Types  of  Assessment.  As  is  relates  to  the  air  advisor,  there  are  three  categories  of assessment  discussed  below.    The  first  two  categories  involve  baseline  assessment  associated with the planning process, while the third involves operational assessment.  See Joint and Service planning  doctrine  referenced  in  Chapter  6  for  discussion  of  establishing  a  baseline  within  the planning process.  See Joint assessment doctrine for a discussion of operational assessment. 8.2.1.  Baseline  assessment  provides  a  strategic-  and/or  operational-level  overview  of  a partner  nation’s  air  force.    The  primary  goal  of  this  assessment  is  to  provide  a  high-level understanding  to  support  the  establishment  of  desired  partner  roles  and/or  country-level military  objectives  within  country  plan  development.    If  the  GCC  has  already  established desired  partner  roles  or  country-level  objectives,  this  assessment  is  unnecessary.    This  is  a limited  scope,  short  duration  assessment  conducted  either  by team, TSOC/AFFOR staff, or by air advisors acting on behalf of the TSOC/AFFOR staff.  This is not  a  detailed  assessment  at  the  tactical  level,  and  must  remain  focused  at  the  operational and/or strategic level.  Experience has shown the use of a Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel,  Leader  Development  and  Education,  Personnel,  and  Facilities  (DOTMLPF), PMESII  (political,  military,  economic,  social,  information,  and  infrastructure),  or  a  similar construct  provides  an  effective  framework  for  this  assessment.    In  most  cases,  this assessment  is  only  necessary  when  beginning  or  renewing  a  US  relationship  with  a  partner nation.  Assessments of this nature normally do not require direct contact with partner nation personnel or on-site visits, relying instead on open source and classified resources and direct contact with the country team and/or GCC personnel. the  country 8.2.2.  Baseline  assessments  are  also  used  to  establish  the  point  of  departure  (the  initial  or current  state)  for  each  military  objective  or  end  state.    The  initial  baseline  of  military objectives, in accordance with planning doctrine, documents the starting point for the partner nation’s  journey  from  an  initial  state  to  an  end  state  (objective).    In  simple  terms,  it’s  very difficult (although not impossible) to achieve to an end state unless you know where you are starting from.  The plan of action to move the partner from the initial state to the end state is referred to as the operational approach, and is discussed in Service and Joint doctrine.  Every operations  plan,  whether  at  the  tactical,  operational,  or  theater-strategic  level,  should  have military objectives, and  an initial  state should be determined for  each objective prior to  the development  of  an  operational  approach.    When  this  assessment  informs  country  plan development  at  the  operational  level,  the  assessment  is  conducted  either  by  the TSOC/AFFOR  staff  or  by  air  advisors  acting  on  behalf  of  the  TSOC/AFFOR  staff.    When AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015   37  this assessment informs event or training/capacity plan development at the tactical level, the assessment is  performed by  air advisors.   This  is a more detailed baseline assessment from what  was  discussed  in  Paragraph  8.2.1  and  is  more  likely  to  require  contact  with  partner nation  personnel  and  on-site  visits.    The  support  and  concurrence  of  the  partner  nation  is critical since a baseline assessment is not possible without the partner’s acceptance and buy-in  to  the  US  military  objective.    The  assessment  framework  to  be  used  is  unique  to  the objective.    The  results  and  insights  of  this  assessment  may  require  changes  to  the  military objective. 8.2.3.  Operational assessment determines progress toward closing the gap between the initial state (baseline) and the objective.  This assessment is necessary at every level where a plan exists:    tactical,  operational,  and  theater-strategic.    Air  advisors  focus  on  the  operational assessment  of  event  and  training/capacity  plans,  which  informs  the  TSOC/AFFOR  staff’s assessment  of  the  country  plan.    The  operational  assessment  of  country  plans  informs  the operational  assessment  of  the  TSOC/COMAFFOR  CSP  and,  ultimately,  the  CCDR  TCP.  Commanders  are  involved  at  every  level  of  operational  assessment.    The  operational assessment framework is built into the plan itself as discussed in Paragraph 6.5.1 and 6.5.2, requiring  the  establishment  of  SMART  objectives,  effects,  and  tasks.    MOPs  support  task accomplishment.    MOEs  support  effects  accomplishment.    MOEs  and  MOPs  provide  the commander and air advisor with evidence and clues related to the progress toward closing the gap between the initial state and objective.  The air advisor and applicable staffs should also provide their own analysis and professional judgment, but ultimately the commander and air advisor  team  lead  decide  if  an  objective  has  or  has  not  been  achieved.    In  either  case,  the operational assessment then informs the refinement of future plans. 8.3.  Assessment Guidance. 8.3.1.  Air advisors comply with  assessment  guidance provided by the TSOC/AFFOR staff.  This guidance is ideally communicated as an annex to the TSOC/COMAFFOR country plan or TSOC/COMAFFOR CSP. 8.3.2.  An  initial  state  for  each  military  objective  should  be  determined  prior  to  the development of an operational approach. 8.3.3.  The  air  advising  team  will  accomplish  an  operational  assessment  for  each  event.  Mission commanders or team leads will communicate the assessment as part of the AAR to the TSOC/AFFOR staff (T-2). 8.3.3.1.  The  AAR  articulates  the  degree  to  which  the  event  objectives  were  satisfied.  Many people use a three-point scale to represent this:  Green, Yellow, and Red. 8.3.3.2.  Data collection associated with the MOEs/MOPs provides support to the report’s assessment. 8.4.  Key Insights Related to Assessment. 8.4.1.  The  air  advisor  plans,  executes,  and  assesses  at  the  tactical  level  in  support  of  the TSOC/COMAFFOR  at  the  operational  level.    This  linkage  of  planning  and  assessment should not be broken. 8.4.2.  Operation  assessment  requires  a  fully  developed  plan  with  SMART  military objectives, along with a starting point for each objective.   38  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015 8.4.3.  Assessment  should  be  built  into  the  plan  from  the  outset  and  not  engineered  as  an afterthought when execution is complete. 8.4.4.  Assessments  must be appropriately scoped, emphasizing operation assessment as the key activity that informs commander decision making. 8.4.5.  The  assessment  approach  should  be  documented  in  an  annex  to  the  event, training/capacity,  or  country  plan.    Air  advisors  should  consider  rehearsing  the  methods  of data collection to be used during event execution. 8.4.6.  The AAR documents the assessment, but it is not the assessment itself and it is not the assessment framework. 8.4.7.  Operation assessments cannot provide absolute proof that an objective has or has not been  achieved.    The  intent  is  to  provide  the  commander  the  most  compelling  information possible so as to inform his/her decision making and future action.  TOD D.

In essence, it is the act  of  communicating  professional  knowledge  and  skills  to  partner  nation  personnel.    Air advising occurs within the following five core tasks:  assessing, training, advising, assisting, and equipping. Air Advising Activities— For the purpose of this instruction, are defined as security cooperation efforts  conducted  in  support  of  combatant  commander  and/or  COMAFFOR/TSOC  objectives across the range of military operations. Air  Advising  Augmentees—Those  forces,  not  defined  as  air  advisors,  but  who  support  air advising  activities.    Air  advising  augmentees  require  a  level  of  training  as  determined  by applicable theater requirements and/or supported organization. Air  Advisor—An  Airman  specially  trained  and  educated  to  apply  aviation  support  and operational expertise to assess, train, advise, assist, and equip partner nations in the development, sustainment, and employment of their aviation enterprise to meet their national security needs, in support  of  US  interests.    This  includes  both  Conventional  and  Special  Operations  Force personnel. Assessment—1. A continuous process that measures the overall effectiveness of employing joint force  capabilities  during  military  operations.    2.

(JP  1-02,  Department  of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms) Aviation  Enterprise  Development  (AED)—Defines  the  plans,  programs,  and  activities undertaken to develop the system of systems necessary for a nation to optimize employment of national  aviation  resources.    The  total  aviation  resource  capacity  and  capability  of  a  nation  is defined  by  the  sum  total  of  all  air  domain  resources  including  humans,  aircraft,  processes  and infrastructure in both the civilian and military/security sectors.  Modern standards that function to  provide  efficient,  safe  and  effective  employment  of  national  aviation  resources  calls  for infrastructure  development  that  considers  the  civilian  aviation  sector  and  the  military/security   44  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015 aviation  sector  of  a  nation  as  mutually  supportive  systems  of  an  integrated  air  domain  in developing nations. (Air Force Global Partnering Strategy) Building  Partnerships  (BP)—BP  Joint  Capability  Area.  The  ability  to  set  the  conditions  for interaction with partner, competitor, or adversary leaders, military forces, or relevant populations by  developing  and  presenting  information  and  conducting  activities  to  affect  their  perceptions, will, behavior, and capabilities (Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review Report, January 2009) Building Partner Capacity (BPC)—Assisting domestic and/or foreign partners and institutions with  the  development  of  their  capabilities  and  capacities—for  mutual  benefit—to  address  US national  or  shared  global  security  interests.  (Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  Policy Memorandum, Joint Capability Areas).  An outcome of Security Force Assistance activities, it is the development of capabilities and capacities among foreign partners for the mutual benefit of the partner and US  national  or shared global security interests.  This  definition is derived from the Tier III JCA of “building the capabilities and capacities of partners and institutions but is not defined in Joint Publications or other DOD Issuances.  (SFA Lexicon and Framework) C—MAJCOM—The  C-MAJCOM  is  the  Air  Force  component  to  specific  Unified  Combatant Commands and presents  its forces to  the combatant  commander through one or more C-NAFs. The  C-MAJCOM  is  commanded  by  the  Commander  of  Air  Force  Forces  (COMAFFOR)  and includes  the  supporting  staff  (C-MAJCOM  staff),  one  or  more  C-NAFs  (with  an  AOC  [or applicable  operations  center]  and  AFFOR  staff)  and  all  assigned  and  attached  forces.  The  C-MAJCOM  staff  supports  the  Air  Force  component  commander  at  the  strategic  level  in developing policy, formulating strategic level guidance, conducting administrative management functions, and executing (through the C-NAF where applicable) CCDR Title 10 responsibilities to organize and train assigned and attached forces to accomplish CCDR-assigned missions (Title 10, Subtitle A, Part I, Chapter 6, Section 164(c)). The C-MAJCOM will integrate, at the strategic level,  component  activities  across  all  phases  of  conflict,  with  a  primary  focus  on  phases  0 (shape),  1  (deter)  and  5  (enable  civil  authority).    (Air  Force  Forces  Command  and  Control Enabling Concept) C—NAF—The  C-NAF  is  the  Air  Force  component  to  specific  combatant  commands,  and supports  the  C-MAJCOM  as  part  of  the  Air  Force  component  to  other  specific  combatant commands. When the C-NAF is part of the C-MAJCOM, the C-NAF, with its AOC and AFFOR staff,  is  the  primary  operational  level  headquarters  element  designed  to  support  the  Air  Force component  commander  at  the  operational  and  tactical  level  through  the  full  range  of  military operations and across all phases of conflict. The C-NAF commander will be prepared to provide command  and  control  of  those  forces  in  contingency  operations  as  a  COMAFFOR,  JFACC and/or  JTF/CC  as  required.  When  the  C-NAF  is  the  component  to  the  unified  combatant command,  the  C-NAF  commander  is  the  COMAFFOR,  and  provides  all  component  support across the full range of military operations and at the strategic, operational and tactical levels as described  above  for  the  C-MAJCOM  and  C-NAF.    (Air  Force  Forces  Command  and  Control Enabling Concept) Campaign Plan—Global campaign plans and theater campaign plans (TCPs) are the centerpiece of  the  planning  construct  and  “operationalize”  Combatant  Command  (CCMD)  theater  or functional  strategies.  Campaign  plans  should  focus  on  the  command’s  steady-state  activities, which  include  ongoing  operations,  military  engagement,  security  cooperation,  deterrence,  and other  shaping  or  preventive  activities.  Campaign  plans  provide  the  vehicle  for  linking  steady-AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015   45  state  shaping  activities  to  the  attainment  of  strategic  and  military  end  states.

COMAFFOR  Strategy—COMAFFOR commander’s long-term vision for the USAF component to the CCMD. theater  and functional  strategies  outline the Combat  Aviation  Advisor  (CAA)—The  CAA  is  a  combat  aviation  advisor  specifically organized  to  assess,  train,  advise  and  assist  foreign  aviation  forces  in  the  employment  and sustainment  of  their  own  assets  in  both  peace,  war  and,  when  necessary,  integrate  those  assets into  joint,  multi-national  operations.  A  principal  objective  of  CAA  advisory  operations  is  to facilitate the availability, reliability, safety, and interoperability of partner nation or participating nation aviation resources to support combined Special Operations Forces.  (definition extracted from AFSOCI 16-101V3) Designated  Air  Advisor  Forces/Units—  Those  forces  and/or  units  with  air  advising  designed operational capability statements and mission essential tasks.  Designated air advisor forces/units have  readiness  requirements  for  personnel,  training,  and  equipment,  if  applicable,  and  report those  requirements  in  status  of  resources  and  training  system  and  defense  readiness  reporting system.  Personnel assigned to the air advising mission in designated forces/units are required to accomplish air advisor education and training at  the Advanced or Basic level prior to reporting ready for the air advisor mission.  Advanced or Basic levels are described in AFI 10-4201V1. Expeditionary  Air  Advisor  Forces—  Those  individuals,  teams,  or  units,  who  are  not  aligned with  an  air  advising  designed  operational  capability  statements  or  mission  essential  tasks.  Consequently,  expeditionary  air  advisor  forces  have  no  specific  readiness  requirements  for personnel, training, and equipment and do not report such requirements in status of resources and training  system  and  defense  readiness  reporting  system.    Expeditionary  air  advisor  forces  are required to accomplish air advisor education and training at the Advanced or Basic level to serve in  an  expeditionary  air  advisor  capacity.    Advanced  or  Basic  levels  are  described  in  AFI  10-4201V1. Extended Training Service Specialists (ETSS)— ETSS are permanent change of station (PCS) teams that are technically qualified to provide advice, instruction, and training in the installation, operation, and maintenance of weapons, equipment, and systems. The ETSS deploy under one of the  security  assistance  authorities  in  Title  22.  They  are  not  used  for  follow-on  retraining  or advisory  roles,  except  in  rare  instances  when  the  recipient  country  cannot  provide  qualified personnel  from  its  own  resources  or  hire  qualified  personnel  from  non-indigenous  sources  and the security cooperation organization recommends it as in the interest of the United States. Foreign  Internal  Defense  (FID)—Participation  by  civilian  and  military  agencies  of  a government  in  any  of  the  action  programs  taken  by  another  government  or  other  designated organization to free and protect its society from subversion, lawlessness, insurgency, terrorism, and other threats to its security. (JP 3-22, Foreign Internal Defense)   46  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015 Foreign  Military  Financing  (FMF)—Foreign  Military  Financing  (FMF)  is  a  critical  foreign policy tool for promoting US interests around the world by ensuring that coalition partners and friendly  foreign  governments  are  equipped  and  trained  to  work  toward  common  security  goals and  share  burdens  in  joint  missions.  In  that  regard,  FMF  is  vital  to  supporting  US  coalition partners  in  the  war  on  terrorism.  FMF  provides  grants  for  the  acquisition  of  US  defense equipment,  services  and  training,  which  promotes  US  national  security  by  contributing  to regional  and  global  stability,  strengthening  military  support  for  democratically-elected governments,  and  containing  transnational  threats  including  terrorism  and  trafficking  in narcotics,  weapons,  and  persons.  These  grants  enable  key  allies  and  friends  to  improve  their defense capabilities and foster closer military relationships between the US and recipient nations. Increased  military  capabilities  build  and  strengthen  multilateral  coalitions  with  the  US  and enable friends and  allies to  be increasingly interoperable  with  regional,  US,  and NATO  forces. By increasing demand  for US  systems,  FMF  also contributes to  a strong US  defense industrial base, an important element of US national defense strategy that reduces cost for Department of Defense  acquisitions  and  secures  more  jobs  for  American  workers.  (Department  of  State Website) Foreign Military Sales (FMS)—That portion of United States security assistance authorized by the  Foreign  Assistance  Act  (FAA)  of  1961  (P.L.  87-195),  as  amended,  and  the  Arms  Export Control  Act  (AECA)  of  1976  (P.L.  90-629),  as  amended.  This  assistance  differs  from  the Military Assistance Program  and the  International  Military Education  and Training Program  in that  the  recipient  provides  reimbursement  for  defense  articles  and  services  transferred.  Also called  FMS.  (JP  1-02)  Under  this  authority,  the  United  States  Government  sells  at  full  cost defense articles and services to foreign governments and international organizations. Functional  Area  Manager  (FAM)—The  individual  accountable  for  the  management  and oversight of all personnel and equipment within a specific functional area to support operational planning  and  execution.  Responsibilities  may  include  developing  and  reviewing  policy; developing, managing, and maintaining unit type codes; developing criteria for and monitoring readiness  reporting;  force  posturing,  analysis,  and  execution  activities  which  are  crucial  to  the management  and  execution  of  Air  Force  readiness  programs.    (AFI  10-401,  Air  Force Operations Planning and Execution) Inherently Governmental Function—as defined in section 5 of the Federal Activities Inventory Reform  Act,  Public  Law  105–270,  means  a  function  that  is  so  intimately  related  to  the  public interest  as  to  require  performance  by  Federal  Government  employees.    (a)  The  term  includes functions that require either the exercise of discretion in applying Federal Government authority or  the  making  of  value  judgments  in  making  decisions  for  the  Federal  Government,  including judgments  relating  to  monetary  transactions  and  entitlements.    An  inherently  governmental function involves, among other things, the interpretation and execution of the laws of the United States so as —(1) to bind the United States to take or not to take some action by contract, policy, regulation,  authorization,  order,  or  otherwise;  (2)  to  determine,  protect,  and  advance  United States economic, political, territorial, property, or other interests by military or diplomatic action, civil  or  criminal  judicial  proceedings,  contract  management,  or  otherwise;  (3)  to  significantly affect  the  life,  liberty,  or  property  of  private  persons;  (4)  to  commission,  appoint,  direct,  or control  officers  or  employees  of  the  United  States;  or  (5)  to  exert  ultimate  control  over  the acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  the  property,  real  or  personal,  tangible  or  intangible,  of  the United  States,  including  the  collection,  control,  or  disbursement  of  appropriations  and  other AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015   47  Federal  funds.    (b)  The  term  does  not  normally  include—(1)  gathering  information  for  or providing  advice,  opinions,  recommendations,  or  ideas  to  Federal  Government  officials;  or  (2) any  function that is  primarily ministerial  and internal  in  nature (such as building security, mail operations,  operation  of  cafeterias,  housekeeping,  facilities  operations  and  maintenance, warehouse operations, motor vehicle fleet management operations, or other routine electrical or mechanical services). Intelligence  Preparation  of  the  Operational  Environment  (IPOE).    The  analytical  process used  by  intelligence  organizations  to  produce  intelligence  estimates  and  other  intelligence products in support of the joint force commander's decision—making process (JP 1-02). It is a continuous process that includes defining the operational environment; describing the impact of the  operational  environment;  evaluating  the  adversary;  and  determining  adversary  courses  of action. International  Health  Specialists  (IHS)—Air  Force  Medical  Service  commissioned  and  non-commissioned  officers  who  serve  predominantly  at  full-time  CCMD  and  Component  HQ positions  to  advise  on  regional  health  issues  as  well  as  work  through  medical  opportunities  to advance CCDR and AFFOR end state objectives. International  Military  Education  and  Training  (IMET)—Formal  or  informal  instruction provided  to  foreign  military  students,  units,  and  forces  on  a  non-reimbursable  (grant)  basis  by offices  or  employees  of  the  United  States,  contract  technicians,  and  contractors  (JP  3-22). Instruction  may  include  correspondence  courses;  technical,  educational,  or  informational publications; and media of all kinds. Irregular  Warfare  (IW)—A  violent  struggle  among  state  and  non-state  actors  for  legitimacy and  influence  over  the  relevant  population(s)  (JP  1-02).    Irregular  warfare  favors  indirect  and asymmetric approaches, though it may employ the full range of military and other capacities, in order to erode an adversary’s power, influence, and will. Lead MAJCOM—A  major subdivision of the Air Force, directly subordinate to Headquarters US  Air  Force.    Lead  MAJCOM  headquarters  are  management  headquarters  and  thus  have  the full range of functional staff. ACC, AMC, AETC, AFMC, AFSOC, AFSPC, AFGSC and AFRC are Lead MAJCOMs.  Lead MAJCOM functions will vary for each MAJCOM. The intent of the Lead MAJCOM, where appropriate, is to consolidate responsibilities for a particular function in a single MAJCOM, supporting the entire Air Force as applicable. (Program Action Directive 07-13,  Implementation  of  the  Chief  Of  Staff  of  the  Air  Force  Direction  to  Transform  and Consolidate Headquarters Management Functions) Mobile Training Teams (MTT)—Military service or contract personnel on temporary duty for the  purpose  of  training  foreign  personnel  in  the  operation,  maintenance,  or  support  of  weapon systems and support equipment or for specific training requirements and specific capabilities that are  beyond  in-country  US  resources.  The  MTT  deploys  under  one  of  the  security  assistance authorities in Title 22 or one of the Title 10 authorized programs that follow security cooperation procedures. The MTT may  be authorized for CONUS or overseas deployment when it is  more practical  to  bring  the  training  capability  to  country  personnel.    An  MTT  should  be  considered when  training  must  be  accomplished  quickly  in  response  to  a  threat  or  adverse  condition affecting the security of  the country;  training is  of relatively  short duration, must reach a large number  of  trainees,  and  entails  extensive  use  of  interpreters  or  language-qualified  team members; or training can be conducted only on equipment or in facilities located in the foreign   48  AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015 country.    Note:    AFSAT  MTTs  may  not  require  training  in  accordance  with  AFI  10-4201V1, dependent  on  size  of  team,  mission  environment,  total  length  or  purpose  of  the  deployment.  Currently AFSAT managed MTTs are not tasked to meet GFMAP or ad-hoc requirements. Request for Forces (RFF)—In those instances in which assigned forces are not available within the  theater  or  are  not  adequate  to  accomplish  the  air  advising  requirement,  the  activity  planner may  initiate  an  RFF  using  approved  Global  Force  Management  Implementation  Guidance procedures.    As  an  example,  SOF  CAA  forces  are  normally  requested  using  the  RFF  process.  However,  the  RFF  process  has  long  timelines  and  is  unable  to  accommodate  changes  in  the original request without re-initiating the entire RFF process.  Because partner nations often plan activities  several  months  ahead  of  an  event  and  can  change  dates  at  the  last  minute,  the  RFF process may not be the best vehicle to use to obtain forces for air advising activities.  Although alternatives to the RFF process are being investigated for GPF forces, at the present time, it is the primary vehicle to use whenever assigned forces are not available. Security Assistance—Programs authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and  the  Arms  Export  Control  Act  of  1976,  as  amended,  or  other  related  statutes  by  which  the United  States  provides  defense  articles,  military  training,  and  other  defense  related  services  by grant,  loan,  credit,  or  cash  sales  in  furtherance  of  national  policies  and  objectives.  Also  called SA. (JP 1-02) Security Cooperation (SC)— Activities undertaken by the Department of Defense to encourage and  enable  international  partners  to  take  a  political  action  in  support  of  United  States  goals; provide the  United States operational  access; and apply capability  and  capacity  consistent with United States defense objectives. Also called SC. (JP 1-02) Security  Force  Assistance  (SFA)—A  subset  of  security  cooperation,  those  Department  of Defense activities requiring legislative authorities that contribute to unified action by the United States Government to support the development of the capacity and capability of foreign security forces and their supporting institutions. Also called SFA. (JP 1-02). Security Sector Reform (SSR)— A comprehensive set of programs and activities undertaken to improve the way a host nation provides safety, security, and justice. Also called SSR (JP 1-02). The  overall  objective  is  to  provide  these  services  in  a  way  that  promotes  an  effective  and legitimate public service that is transparent, accountable to civilian authority, and responsive to the needs of the public.  From a donor perspective, SSR is an umbrella term that might include integrated  activities  in  support  of  defense  and  armed  forces  reform;  civilian  management  and oversight;  justice,  police,  corrections,  and  intelligence  reform;  national  security  planning  and strategy  support;  border  management;  disarmament;  demobilizations  and  reintegration;  or reduction  of  armed  violence.  The  DOD’s  primary  role  is  SSR  is  supporting  the  reform, restructuring,  or  re-establishment  of  the  armed  forces  and  the  defense  sector  across  the operational spectrum. Special  Operations  Forces  (SOF)—Those  Active  and  Reserve  Component  forces  of  the Military Services designated by the Secretary of Defense and specifically organized, trained, and equipped to conduct and support special operations. Subordinate Campaign  Plan—A CCMD prepared plan that satisfies the requirements under a DOD  GCP,  which,  depending  upon  the  circumstances,  transitions  to  a  supported  or  supporting plan in execution. AFI10-4201V3  25 JUNE 2015   49  Theater  Campaign  Plan—A  GCC’s  plan  to  accomplish  strategic  or  operational  objectives within a geographic AOR.  The TCP operationalizes the CCDR’s theater strategy and translates strategic concepts into unified actions. Tier  Waiver  Authorities—Tier Waiver Authority is based on consequence of non-compliance and approval authority (AFI 33-360, Table 1.1). T—0 Requirement is external to the Air Force (requests for waivers must be processed through command channels to publication OPR for consideration). T—1 Waiver Authority is MAJCOM/CC (delegable no lower than the MAJCOM Director), with the concurrence of the publication’s Approving Official. T—2 Waiver Authority is MAJCOM/CC (delegable no lower than MAJCOM Director). T—3  Waiver  Authority  is  Wing/DRU/FOA/CC  (delegable  no  lower  than  Group/CC  or equivalent). USAF  Campaign  Support  Plan—An  annual  plan  at  the  national-strategic  level,  summarizing steady-state  operations  in  support  of  CCDR  functional  and  theater  campaign  plans  and  USAF-specific shaping activities that directly contribute to US and USAF interests.
