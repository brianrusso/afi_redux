Purpose.  This  chapter  outlines  the  mission,  vision,  policy,  and  principles  of  the  AF  EM Program,  including  responsibilities  at  the  following  levels:  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SAF) agencies,  Air  Force,  MAJCOM,  AFIMSC,  and  installation.  It  also  outlines  responsibilities  of supported  and  supporting  organizations  such  as  United  States  Northern  Command (USNORTHCOM), Joint Task Force–Civil Support (JTF-CS), and others. 1.2.  Mission.  The primary mission of the AF EM Program is to save lives; minimize the loss or degradation  of  resources;  and  continue,  sustain,  and  restore  operational  capability  in  an  all-hazards physical threat environment at AF installations worldwide. 1.2.1.  The ancillary missions are to support homeland defense (HD) and civil support (CS) operations  and  to  provide  support  to  civil  and  host  nation  (HN)  authorities  according  to Department of Defense (DoD) publications and through the appropriate combatant command (CCMD). 1.2.2.  The AF EM Program contributes to mission assurance and the continuation of mission essential functions (MEFs) necessary to perform the operations of the installation in support of the national military strategy. 1.3.  Vision.  The vision of the AF EM Program  is  to  utilize an all-hazards approach to  protect the  AF  community  and  mission  capability  effectively  and  efficiently,  leveraging  Joint, interagency, and civilian authority's capacity as necessary. 1.4.  Program Policy.  PPD-8 aims to strengthen the security and resilience of the United States (U.S.) through systematic preparation for the threats that pose the greatest risk to the security of the  Nation,  including  acts  of  terrorism,  cyber-attacks,  pandemics,  and  catastrophic  natural disasters.  1.4.1.  The  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SecAF)  established  a  single,  integrated  AF  EM Program through AFPD 10-25.  1.4.2.  The  AF  EM  Program  develops  and  implements  measures  for  and  manages  activities related  to  emergency  preparedness,  incident  management,  and  non-medical  Counter-CBRN (C-CBRN),  CBRN  defense,  and  CBRN  consequence  management  (CBRN  CM).  The  Air Force Director of Civil  Engineers  (AF/A4C) is  the OPR for the AF EM  Program.  AF/A4C will collaborate with AF/SG to ensure EM measures are integrated.  1.4.3.  When  compliance  with  this  publication  is  impractical  due  to  unique  local  or MAJCOM situations and the conditions of AFI 33-360, paragraph 1.9, Waivers, are satisfied, request a waiver through the specified Tiered Waiver Approval Authority according to AFI 33-360.  For  non-tiered  items,  request  a  waiver  from  AF/A4CX  through  AFCEC/CX.  An approved waiver remains in effect IAW AFI 33-360, para 1.9.4.3.3. When the OPR revises this publication, the waiver requester must renew the waiver. AF/A4CX will maintain a copy of all waiver requests with  the official  instruction record set.  During the  waiver period, the 8 AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 requesting commander/director shall actively  work toward compliance by  reducing the  cost of compliance and remedying resource shortfall in IAW AFI 33-360, paragraph 1.9.5.4.3. (T-1). 1.5.  EM Principles.  The AF EM Program examines potential emergencies and disasters based on  the  risks  posed  by  likely  hazards  and  threats,  develops  and  implements  activities  aimed  at reducing  the  impact  of  these  incidents  on  the  installation,  prepares  for  risks  that  cannot  be eliminated, and prescribes actions to  deal  with  consequences of actual incidents and to  recover from those incidents. The EM program includes seven principles and five mission areas. 1.5.1.  The  following  EM  Program  principles  are  comprehensive,  progressive,  risk  driven, integrated,  collaborative,  coordinated,  and  flexible.  The  installation  commander  should consider these EM principles when executing the EM Program.(T-3) 1.5.1.1.  Take  into  account  all  hazards,  phases,  stakeholders,  and  impacts  relevant  to disasters. 1.5.1.2.  Anticipate  and  plan  for  future  disasters  and  take  proactive  measures  to  build disaster-resistant and disaster-resilient communities. 1.5.1.3.  Incorporate  sound  risk  management  principles  in  assigning  priorities  and resources through the Integrated Risk Management Process (IRMP). 1.5.1.4.  Unify efforts between all related AF programs and the local community. 1.5.1.5.  Create  relationships  among  individuals  and  organizations  to  encourage  trust, advocate a team atmosphere, build consensus, and facilitate communication. 1.5.1.6.  Synchronize  activities  between  all  relevant  stakeholders  to  achieve  a  common purpose. 1.5.1.7.  Create innovative approaches in solving disaster challenges. 1.5.2.  The National Preparedness Goal presents an integrated approach to preparedness with emphasis  on  building  and  sustaining  core  capabilities  across  the  five  EM  mission  areas: Prevention, Protection, Response, Recovery, and Mitigation. 1.6.  Air  Force  Incident  Management  System.  AF  installation  commanders  will  use  AFIMS for  both  peacetime  and  wartime  incidents/emergencies  IAW  AFMAN  10-2502,  Air  Force Incident  Management  System.  (T-1).  The  AFIMS  uses  an  approach  based  on  the  NIMS  and integrates  components  from  the  NPF  that  effectively  and  efficiently  works  together  with  local, state, and federal  governments in  order to  respond to,  recover from,  and mitigate the effects  of incidents/emergencies, regardless of cause, size, or complexity.

This  chapter  discusses  the  organization  of  the  AF  EM  Program  at  all  levels  of command.  The  AF  EM  Program  structure  establishes  a  clear  progression  of  coordination  and communication from AF level to MAJCOM and AFIMSC level to the installation.  2.2.  Air Force Corporate Structure. 2.2.1.  At  the  AF  level,  the  EM  planning  and  management  structure  is  supported  by  and supports AF/A4C; the AF EMWG; the AF C-WMD Council; the AF C-WMD PWG; the AF C-WMD  MWG;  the  AF  C-WMD  Education,  Training,  Exercise  Working  Group;  and  the SEMASG. These working groups must synchronize AF EM Program policy and programs. 2.3.  MAJCOM EM Program Structure. 2.3.1.  At  the  MAJCOM  level,  the  EM  Planning  and  Management  Structure  includes  an EMWG,  which  collaborates  with  other  MAJCOM  working  groups  such  as,  the  TWG,  C-CBRN  Working  Group,  and  ATWG.  This  instruction  does  not  restrict  MAJCOMs  from combining the EMWG with other working groups (e.g., ATWG with the EMWG) as long as issues for all programs are addressed. The MAJCOM EMWG is the primary working group supporting  the  AF  EM  Program  through  the  development  of  MAJCOM  guidance  and strategic plans. 2.3.1.1.  The  MAJCOM  EMWG  addresses  cross-functional  issues  affecting  the  AF  EM Program  capabilities  within  the  MAJCOM  (e.g.,  natural  disasters  and  human-caused incidents).  If  not  combined  with  another  working  group,  the  MAJCOM  CE  chairs  the MAJCOM EMWG. The MAJCOM EMWG is administered by the AFIMSC Detachment and meets at least semi-annually to review and access  any installation trends, capability gaps, and/or policy shortfalls that require MAJCOM attention and resolution. MAJCOM EMWG  representatives  should  be  subject  matter  action  officers.  Table  2.1,  shows  the recommended MAJCOM EMWG membership.  Table 2.1.  Recommended MAJCOM EMWG Membership. Emergency Management Communications Maintenance Aircrew Flight Equipment Fire Emergency Services  Financial Management Chaplain Corps Logistics Operations Force Support  Historian Intelligence Security Forces  Air Force Office of Special Investigations Explosive Ordnance Disposal Inspector General Judge Advocate Public Affairs  Plans and Programs Command Surgeon  Safety 2.3.1.2.  At  MAJCOM  level,  the  response  elements  include  the  MAJCOM  Command Center,  CAT,  EOC,  and  specialized  teams  such  as  the  MAJCOM  RTFs.  MAJCOMs activate their CATs  and/or emergency  operations staff/cell when requested by  Air Staff AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 35 or  the  MAJCOM  commander.  The  MAJCOM  CAT  or  emergency  operations  staff/cell assists the Air Staff or installations in response efforts. 2.4.  Installation Emergency Management Program Structure. 2.4.1.  The Management, EMWG, and Unit EM representatives.  installation  EM  Program  structure includes the  Office  of  Emergency 2.4.2.  The Mission Support Group commander chairs the installation EMWG and establishes working  subgroups.  The  EMWG  Charter,  approved  by  the  installation  commander,  will identify the installation’s EMWG members. The EMWG meets quarterly, according to DODI 6055.17,  as  a  decision-making  body  that  applies  the  collective  judgment  and  experience  to installation  issues  and  oversees  the  implementation  of  AF  policy  on  the  installation  EM Program.  (T-0). The installation commander has  the authority to  combine the EMWG with other similar working groups as long as they meet DODI 6055.17 requirements.

The  primary  objective  of  EM  planning  is  to  minimize  the  loss  of  operational capability caused by incidents. EM planning addresses an all-hazards approach for the AF.  3.1.1.  The  AF  EM  Program  defines  an  all-hazards  approach  as  a  methodology  to  develop EM strategies for all types of potential incidents. “All-hazards” include any incident, natural or manmade, that warrants action to protect the life, property, health, and safety of military members,  dependents,  and  civilians  at  risk,  and  minimize  any  disruptions  of  installation operations. 3.1.2.  Personnel categorization is the key process for identifying the “demographics of need” within  assigned  personnel.  This  process  consists  of  identifying  population  categories  with similar needs and a common protection strategy. The AF EM Program integrates the existing categorization  process  identified  in  DODI  6055.17  and  DODI  2000.16,  DoD  Antiterrorism (AT)  Standards,  into  a  five-category  system  defined  by  common  protection  strategies.  For further information regarding Personnel Categorization, refer to AFMAN 10-2502.  3.2.  General Planning Considerations. 3.2.1.  The  Installation  Emergency  Manager  will  integrate  planning  with  other  federal agencies in response to catastrophic incidents as defined by DODD 3025.18 and the NPF. (T-0). 3.3.  Mutual Aid Agreements and Support Contracts. 3.3.1.  The  installation  commander  will  establish  MAAs  to  fill  a  capability  shortfall  for  the installation,  or  for  the  installation  to  support  local  authorities,  all  tenant  units,  and  GSUs. Identify EM-related MAAs in the IEMP 10-2. (T-0). 3.3.2.  When  needed,  utilize  support  contracts  for  the  procurement  of  goods,  services,  or other  emergency  support,  to  include  offensive  HAZMAT/CBRN  operations,  or  the contingency  procurement  of  food  and  water  supplies  for  safe  havens  on  AF  installations  at time of activation.  Section 3B—Planning Process and Risk Management Process. 3.4.  Integrated  Risk  Management  Process  (IRMP).  Installations  will  use  the  IRMP, comprising  four  assessments,  Criticality,  Hazard,  Vulnerability,  and  Capability,  as  the foundation  for  EM  planning  and  resource  decisions  to  enhance  emergency  preparedness, contingency response, and mission continuation. (T-0). 3.4.1.  In  compliance  with  DODI  6055.17,  these  four  assessments  must  be  performed annually.  Installations  will  use  these  assessments  to  tailor  and  refine  their  IEMP  10-2  to installation-specific  risks.  (T-0).  AFMAN  10-2502  provides  detailed  information  on  the IRMP.  42 AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 3.4.2.  CBRN  LTAs,  MTAs,  and  HTAs  are  based  on  a  transparent,  repeatable  process utilizing  agreed-upon  intelligence  documents  to  categorize  the  CBRN  threat  throughout  the world.    This  assessment,  in  conjunction  with  other  venues  such  as  the  Integrated  Security Council  (ISC)  scenarios,  assists  with  CBRN  defense  deliberate  planning  for  training  and resource  requirements/management.  Air  components,  MAJCOMs,  and  installations  must evaluate  the  current  operations,  intelligence  reports,  and  risk  assessments  to  determine  the current local threat. (T-1).  Refer to Table 4.6 for an unclassified listing.  Section 3C—Installation Emergency Management Plan 10-2. 3.5.  IEMP  10-2  Purpose.  The  IEMP  10-2  is  an  all-hazards  plan  designed  to  support  pre-incident preparedness, mitigation, emergency response, and recovery. 3.5.1.  The plan should be reviewed periodically to ensure the DRF is familiar with the plan and able to execute their assigned roles. Develop the IEMP 10-2 based on the results of the IRMP.  Using  the  IEMP  10-2  planning  tool  at  https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-EN-CE-A6/21340/OO-EN-CE-52/iemp_10-2/SitePages/Home.aspx will ensure the plan has all the elements identified in AFMAN 10-2502. 3.5.2.  The  IEMP  10-2  provides  comprehensive  guidance  for  an  emergency  response  to natural, technological, or man-made physical hazards. AFMAN 10-2502 and AFTTP 3-2.83 provide more detailed information concerning the IEMP 10-2 development.  3.5.3.  The installation commander is the approval authority for the IEMP 10-2. The planning team  will  review  the  plan  annually  and  update,  as  necessary.  The  review  will  include  the signature  of  the  installation  commander  validating  that  (1)  the  review  has  occurred,  (2)  the installation  commander  and  installation  EMWG  have  BEn  briefed  on  changes,  (3)  the installation  EOC  team  has  received  information  regarding  the  changes,  and  (4)  supporting plans and implementing instructions have BEn updated, as necessary, to reflect the changes. (T-0).  3.6.  Unit Implementing Instructions.  Each installation unit, including all DOD and non-DOD tenants,  will  develop  unit  implementing  instructions  to  execute  direct  taskings  outlined  in  the IEMP 10-2. (T-1).  3.6.1.  Unit  implementing  instructions  expand  on  the  tasks  outlined  in  the  basic  plan, annexes, and appendices by adding specificity on who, what, when, where, and how actions will be accomplished. There are several types of implementing instructions that organizations may  develop.  These  include  Operating  Instructions,  Operating  Guides,  Standard  Operating Procedures, and Quick Response Checklists. Units must develop and/or update implementing instructions within 60 days of an IEMP 10-2 publication. (T-3).  3.6.2.  Once  implementing  instructions  are  complete  and  before  implementation,  they  must be  coordinated  through  the  Office  of  Emergency  Management  and  then  approved  by  the owning unit commander. (T-3). AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 43 Chapter 4 PREPAREDNESS Section 4A—Air Force EM Education and Training. 4.1.  Summary.  This  chapter  provides  policy  and  guidance  for  EM  training  and  education, exercises, interagency coordination, and logistics. 4.2.  Purpose.  This  section  provides  AF  EM  education  and  training  policy  and  guidance, including  objectives,  responsibilities,  and  requirements.  AF  EM  education  and  training  applies the  all-hazards  concept  of  integrating  cross-functional  education  and  training  into  the  AF  EM Program. 4.3.  Objective.  Air  Force  EM  education  and  training  provides  the  required  knowledge  and skills needed to prepare for, respond to, mitigate, and recover from contingencies or emergencies requiring AF response. 4.3.1.  Air Force EM education and training complies with federal, DOD, joint, and national consensus standards in meeting training levels, frequency, and comprehensiveness. 4.3.2.  Air  Force  EM  education  and  training  must  include  realistic  exercises  and  scenarios demonstrating  the  level  of  proficiency  required  for  a  response  to  actual  contingencies  or emergencies. (T-0)  4.4.  Policy.  The  required  audience  for  AF  EM  education  and  training  includes  personnel specified in paragraph  4.8 4.4.1.  Personnel will attend the appropriate courses to meet the level of proficiency required to accomplish their assigned tasks. Figure 4.1 illustrates EM tiered training. (T-2). 4.4.2.  Unit  commanders  must  ensure  their  personnel  complete  all  course  components  to include any prerequisites within the required timeframe as identified in  paragraph 4.8. (T-2). 4.4.3.  MAJCOM  and  installation  leadership  must  ensure  service  contracts  for  support personnel  include  education  and  training  requirements.  (T-1).  The  required  education  and training must be equal to the education and training required of each individual’s military and federal  counterparts.  The  equivalent  training  is  required  only  for  equivalent  positions,  not contractors  who  fulfill  only  some  of  the  duties  comparable  to  their  military  or  federal counterpart with the exception of the Base Emergency Preparedness Orientation.  4.4.4.  WIT members must be trained to at least the same level of the person being evaluated. (T-1). 44 AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 Figure 4.1.  EM Tiered Training.  4.4.5.  Individuals  who  have  completed  previous  online  training  courses  required  to  fulfill their  role  within  the  installation  DRF  or  EM  Program  are  not  required  to  redo  the  online portions specified in this publication unless otherwise noted.  4.5.  Instructor Requirements.  Unless otherwise specified, only military, civilian, or contractor personnel who complete the AETC Emergency Management Apprentice Course may instruct the instructor-led components listed in paragraph 4.8. (T-1). 4.6.  Scheduling and Documentation Requirements. 4.6.1.  Installation  and  tenant  unit  deployment  managers  (UDMs),  unit  training  managers (UTMs), or unit training schedulers will use the Automated Civil Engineer System-Personnel and  Readiness  (ACES-PR)  Unit  Scheduler  Module  to  schedule  personnel  for  AF  EM education  and  training  instructor-led  components  or  courses  conducted  by  the  installation’s Office  of  Emergency  Management.  Each  unit  is  responsible  for  tracking  completion  and currency of their personnel. (T-2). 4.6.2.  UDMs,  UTMs,  or  unit  training  schedulers  will  ensure  personnel  have  successfully completed  all  prerequisite  and  on-line  training  component  requirements  prior  to  being scheduled for the instructor-led component of courses. (T-2). 4.6.3.  Units  must  maintain  documentation  of  AF  EM  education  and  training  course completion. (T-3). 4.6.4.  Unit  EM  representatives  must  coordinate  their  required  unit’s  EM  reporting  efforts with  their  UDM,  UTMs,  or  unit  training  schedulers  to  ensure  they  have  the  most  accurate education and training data reflected in their reports. (T-3). AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 45 4.7.  Delivery  Formats.  AF  EM  education  and  training  courses  are  delivered  using  individual knowledge based objectives and localized/performance based objectives. 4.7.1.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  deliver  individual  knowledge-based  component  of  a course (ADLS) (https://golearn.csd.disa.mil). the  Advanced  Distributed  Learning Service on-line via 4.7.2.  Completing the individual knowledge-based course component is an individual effort. Group or team completion is not authorized. 4.7.3.  Use traditional instructor-led classroom methods to deliver the localized/performance-based  component  of  a  course.  This  format  allows  for  the  tailored  presentation  of  localized mission and threat procedures and the hands-on evaluation of a student’s ability to perform applicable tasks. 4.7.3.1.  Unless otherwise specified, the instructor-led component of the courses listed in paragraph 4.8, are provided by the installation’s Office of Emergency Management. 4.8.  Prescribed  Courses.

In  order  to  develop  a  resilient  AF community  and  a  culture  of  preparedness,  the  Air  Force  “Be  Ready”  Awareness  Campaign ensures all individuals have the knowledge needed to play an integral part in the success of their installation’s EM Program. In support of this campaign, each installation’s Office of Emergency Management must establish and actively maintain a local “Be Ready” awareness campaign. (T-3). Each installation’s local  campaign must be tailored to  raise awareness, warn, and  guide the community’s  behavior  concerning  the  hazards  that  may  affect  them,  their  family,  or  the installation where they work and live. (T-3). 4.9.1.  Individuals  receive  an  initial  introduction  to  the  local  hazards  and  measures  to consider  before,  during,  and  after  an  emergency  through  the  BEPO  as  identified  in Attachment 3. Section 4B—Air Force EM Exercises. 4.10.  Exercises. 4.10.1.  The Emergency Manager must work closely with the WIT Chief. (T-3). 4.10.2.  Table  4  2  identifies  core  capabilities  to  assess  and  train  installation  personnel  and the  DRF’s  ability  to  respond  to  adversarial/human-caused,  technological/accidental,  or natural  threats  outlined  in  the  IEMP  10-2.  These  capabilities  should  include  both  home station and deployed combat operations for any unit. AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 47 Table 4.2.  EM Exercise Core Capabilities.   Develop exercise objectives to assess the following abilities: 1.  Activate INWS. (Integrate periodic testing of the local weather watch, advisory and warning dissemination systems). 2.

Installations must conduct a minimum of two active shooter exercises each calendar year. (T-0) 48 AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 Section 4C—Interagency Coordination. 4.11.  Support Agreements 4.11.1.  During preparing and planning activities, identify mutual aid required or provided by the  installation.  The  genesis  for  MAAs  is  typically  from  the  need  for  emergency  response that exceeds local resources, such as a disaster or a multiple-alarm fire.  4.11.2.  In addition to mutual aid that exists between first responders, the installation Office of  Emergency  Management  may  include  inter-service  mutual  assistance  with  other  AF Readiness  &  Emergency  Management  Flights  and  offices  of  emergency  management  of other services in the local area. Acknowledge existing MAAs in the IEMP 10-2. 4.11.3.  The  Installation  Emergency  Manager  must  identify  any  relation  to  or  impact  from standing Emergency Management Assistance Compacts (EMAC). (T-3). 4.11.3.1.  EMACs are not to be used for the coordination, deployment, and/or utilization of  military  equipment  or  personnel.  Exception:  EMAC  arrangements  may  apply differently  to  ANG  units  based  upon  established  state  EMACs.  The  Installation Emergency  Manager  may  identify  designated  contacts  at  the  respective  SEMA  as  an entry point into the EMAC for any DOD, civilian, and contractor response and recovery assistance. 4.11.3.2.  Access to ANG assets (including CST and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear,  and  High-Yield  Explosives  Enhanced  Response  Force  Package  [CERFP CBRNE]  assets)  beyond  immediate  action  to  save  lives,  reduce  human  suffering,  or mitigate  great  property  damage  must  be  coordinated  through  the  state  Joint  Force Headquarters. (T-0). 4.12.  Defense Support of Civil Authorities. 4.12.1.  The AF EM Program will support DSCA responses outlined in DODD 3025.18 and AFI  10-801.  The  IEMP  10-2  must  address  the  following  types  of  responses:  immediate response, MAAs, 10-day rule, and Presidential declarations. (T-0). 4.12.2.  When  such  conditions  exist  and  time  does  not  permit  prior  approval  from  higher headquarters, local military commanders and responsible officials of other DOD components can  respond  to  civil  authorities’  requests,  with  follow-on  reporting  through  the  appropriate command chain as soon as possible. 4.13.  Emergency Public Information. 4.13.1.  The Emergency Public Information (EPI) function gives the public accurate, timely, and useful information throughout the emergency period. The EPI function initially focuses on the dissemination of information and instructions to the people at risk on the installation. 4.13.2.  The  installation  AF  EM  Program  must  include  written  procedures  for  establishing, maintaining, and executing an EPI function. (T-2). 4.13.2.1.  As  a  minimum,  the  EPI  function  should  address  identified  resources  (e.g., installation social media site, cable channel, radio station); coverage (e.g., work centers, family housing, temporary lodging); vulnerabilities on how the means for disseminating AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 49 EPI  could  be  harmed  by  the  hazards;  dependency  on  local  media  resources;  and  public preparedness campaigns. 4.13.2.2.  The installation public information capability will also include a central contact facility  for  the  media;  pre-scripted  information  bulletins  relevant  to  the  installation’s identified  hazards;  a  method  to  coordinate  and  clear  information  for  release;  the capability  of  communicating  with  special  needs  populations;  and  protective  action guidelines/recommendations. (T-2). Section 4D—AF EM Logistics. 4.14.  Capability Assessment. 4.14.1.  To determine installation equipment needs, the EMWG will evaluate the mission and risks  IAW  the  IRMP.  To  maintain  spare  parts  for  user-level  maintenance,  installations  will base  stock  levels  on  anticipated  consumption  during  scheduled  maintenance,  operations, training, and exercises. (T-2). 4.14.2.  LRS  (or  equivalent)  stores  and  maintains  C  Bag  assets  and  spare  parts  used  for protective mask testing, inspection and user level maintenance. Other assets required for unit specialized  teams  (such  as  CCT,  SMT,  or  PAR)  to  meet  functional  area  requirements (security  forces  protective  masks,  self-contained  breathing  apparatus,  detectors)  will  be funded and maintained by the unit. (T-2). 4.14.3.  Installations  will  not  stock  supplies  solely  for  the  purpose  of  DSCA,  as  directed  in DODD 3025.18, unless otherwise directed by the SecDef. (T-0). 4.15.  Installation  Response  Equipment.  Unit  Commanders  will  ensure  personnel  have adequate  equipment  to  respond  to  all  hazards  that  threaten  the  installation.  (T-3).  MAJCOMs with  AFIMSC  Detachment  support,  FOAs,  and  DRUs  may  specify  minimum  equipment requirements  for  subordinate  units.  Installations  must  budget  for,  acquire,  and  maintain equipment for man-made or natural disasters, on or off base. (T-2). 4.15.1.  CCMD,  MAJCOM,  and  installation  plans  will  identify  types  and  quantities  of  EM equipment and supplies needed for specific missions. (T-1). 4.16.  AF EM Equipment Budget. 4.16.1.  Table  4  3  lists  the  PE  Codes  for  wartime  CBRN  defense  and  terrorist  WMD response equipment for RegAF, AFRC, and ANG units and personnel. For medical response equipment, supplies, and services, PE 28036F will be used by the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF)  for  home  station  (see  AFI  41-106,  Medical  Readiness  Program  Management,  for guidance on both home station and deployed equipment).

R&EM  Flights  will  refer  to  AS  and  the  EM  UTC  Equipment  and  Supply  Lists (ESLs) for home-station and deployed equipment authorizations. The R&EM flights will use the  current  program  of  record,  Automated  Civil  Engineer  System  Resource  Management (ACES-RM),  for  equipment  accountability.  Base  CEs  will  approve  ACES-RM  inventories annually. (T-1). 4.17.3.  Specialized protective equipment may be required for the EM missions of teams such as  Shelter  Management,  UCC,  Mobility,  and  support  teams.  Use  the  AS  or  functional  area guidance for these requirements.  4.17.4.  AF  installations  must  have  mobile  communications  capabilities  to  support  incident response C2 and be used as the ICP. (T-1). Level 1, the minimum standard, capability would AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 51 be  through  assigned  First  Responder  (Medical,  Security  Forces,  and  FES  vehicles  with assigned  tactical  communications  equipment.  The  Office  of  Emergency  Management,  as  a follow-on emergency responder will, if required, arrange for support through ESF 1. Submit additional capability, if required, for a unique requirement through the AFIMSC Detachment to the MAJCOM and AFIMSC for approval. (T-1). 4.18.  Unit  Emergency  Response  Equipment.  Unit  commanders  must  identify  requirements and  budget  for,  obtain,  store,  and  maintain  material  needed  to  accomplish  their  specific functional response tasks in support of response plans. (T-3). Examples include specialized AFS and  specialized  team  equipment,  supporting  shelter  management,  SIP,  PAR,  and  CCA  team tasks. Unit  equipment  does not  include protective masks and assets maintained by the  LRS (or equivalent) for wartime C Bag requirements in Table 4.5.  4.18.1.  Unit  commanders  must  ensure  unit  material,  including  material  in  bulk  storage,  is properly maintained and inventoried. (T-1). 4.18.2.  Units must identify and mark training equipment IAW T.O.s. Do NOT store training equipment with operational equipment. (T-1). 4.19.  CBRN Incident Response Equipment. 4.19.1.  4F9W-series  UTCs  provide  3E9X1s  the  equipment  to  execute  their  peacetime  and wartime  CBRN  response  mission  and  may  be  used  to  support  the  FES  for  a  typical  non-medical CBRN or HAZMAT incident. 4.19.1.1.  UTC  4F9WM  is  designed  for  home  station  EM  response.  The  UTC  is  not designed or intended for deployment support. Do not palletize or task the 4F9WM UTC to deploy for inspections or exercises. (T-1). 4.19.2.  Medical  UTCs  and  the  HSMR  program  provide  capability  needed  for  local  CBRN response.    HSMR  Equipment  guidance  and  accountability  procedures  are  found  in  AFI  41-106 and AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics Support. 4.19.3.  War  Reserve  Materiel  (WRM)  may  be  used  to  support  domestic  incidents,  but approval  will  be  obtained  from  the  WRM  releasing  authority  IAW  AFI  25-101,  Air  Force War  Reserve  Materiel  (WRM)  Policies  and  Guidance.  When  WRM  is  used  to  support domestic incidents, notify the approving authority as soon as possible. (T-1). 4.20.  Groundcrew CWDE. 4.20.1.  LRS will stock, store, and issue operational and training equipment to installation or unit  personnel.  (T-1).  Table    4.5  lists  the  basis  of  issue  (BOI)  for  each  authorized  asset (including the protective mask) in the C-Bag. LRS will stock, store, issue, and maintain these assets at home station and when deployed according to AFI 23-101, AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution, T.O.s, and guidance in this publications. (T-1). 52 AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 Table 4.5.  C Bag Operational and Training Asset Basis of Issue (T-0).  4.20.2.  LRS  will  issue  expired  assets  for  training  use,  as  identified  in  Table  4.5,  to  every Airman.  Individuals  issued  training  assets  are  responsible  for  cleaning,  maintenance,  and accountability of those assets. Use the same operational protective mask for training and real world operation. 4.20.3.  MAJCOM  A4s,  in  coordination  with  MAJCOM  JAs,  will  review  Host  Tenant Support  agreements  to  determine  if  valid  requirements  exist  to  issue  CBRN  IPE  to  foreign nationals  working  on  AF  installations  at  foreign  (non-domestic)  locations.  If  valid requirements exist, MAJCOM A4 staffs will direct their installations’ LRS to determine and stock appropriate quantities of IPE. MAJCOM A4 staffs will also direct their installations to issue required IPE. (T-1). 4.20.3.1.  Other  considerations  include  the  capability  to  provide  IPE  as  required  for Enemy Prisoners of War, retained personnel, civilian internees, and others detained in AF custody. 4.20.3.2.  AMC will consider Civil Reserve Air Fleet and airlift contractor requirements. 4.20.4.  LRS  will  provide  CBRN  IPE  to  each  DoD  contractor  identified  as  emergency-essential  in  their  contract  and  located  in  or  deploying  to  HTA  or  MTA  areas.  See  DODI 1100.22, Policy and Procedures for Determining Workforce Mix. (T-0). 4.20.5.  Individuals  declared  hard-to-fit  by  the  BE  Flight  during  Quantitative  Fit  Testing (QNFT) will be issued an M-45 or other DoD mask and spare parts for deployment. (T-1). 4.20.6.  Installations  will  procure  and  maintain  C-Bags  and  training  equipment  as  listed  in Table 4.5 (T-1). AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 53 4.20.7.  Installations will procure and maintain D-Bag BOI and training equipment defined in AFI  11-301  Volume  2,  Management  and  Configuration  Requirements  for  Aircrew  Flight Equipment (AFE). (T-1). 4.21.  CBRN C-Bag Authorizations. 4.21.1.  LRS will determine C-Bag authorizations and update MICAS by 1 December. (T-2). Follow  guidance  in  AFI  10-403,  Chapter  2,  and  AFI  23-101.  (T-2).  For  installations  in MTA/HTA  (see  Table  4.6),  authorizations  include  military  base  populace,  emergency essential civilians and contractors, and host nation personnel identified for AF support in host nation agreements. 4.21.2.  C-Bags  may  be  prepositioned  for  central  issue  to  personnel  for  Air  and  Space Expeditionary  Force  (AEF)  deployments  to  MTAs  or  HTAs.  C-Bag  guidance  for  these personnel  will  be  included  within  AOR  reporting  instructions.  Air  components  and MAJCOMs will determine if personnel  assigned TDY to a MTA or HTA during peacetime will  be  required  to  bring  a  complete  operational  C  Bag  and  related  field  gear,  including helmet  and  body  armor.  Personnel  participating  in  MTA  or  HTA  operational  readiness exercises or inspections will bring training IPE components and a protective mask. (T-2). Table 4.6.  CBRN Threat Area Designation.

Personal  Protective  Equipment  (PPE)  is  equipment  worn  to  minimize  exposure  to serious  workplace  injuries  and  illness.  IPE  is  a  subset  of  PPE  specifically  designed  for  a traditional CBRN wartime environment. The installation BE determines the appropriate level of PPE/IPE. IPE is not typically approved or used for peacetime HAZMAT response.  54 AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 4.23.  Funding and Reporting. 4.23.1.  AFIMSC will centrally manage funding for the non-medical components of C and D Bags  using  PEs  27593F,  55165F,  and  55166F.    AFCEC/CXR,  NGB,  and  AFRC  Civil Engineer  Readiness  Divisions  will  coordinate  funding  with  MAJCOM/A4RS  and  A3T. AF/A3 and A4 will provide CWDE requirements to AFCEC/CXR annually NLT 31 January. 4.23.2.  All  assigned,  attached,  and  tenant  RegAF  units  report  their  C  Bag  and  funding requirements to their assigned bases. Units report requirements to the host MAJCOM, not the owning MAJCOM. (T-1). 4.23.3.  Joint  bases  will  report  their  requirements  through  their  respective  components.  For example, AF units supported by the Army will report their mobility bag requirements to their MAJCOM/A4 and not through the Army. Funding for AF requirements that support mission or wartime requirements will come from the AFIMSC. (T-1). 4.23.4.  ANG and AFRC commanders will fund for their forces’ C and D Bags, CBRN and EM UTC equipment, and CBRN defense course support equipment and materials. (T-1). AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 55 Chapter 5 RESPONSE AND RECOVERY Section 5A—Department of Defense and Air Force Response. 5.1.  Purpose.  This  chapter  will  outline  the  AF  EM  Program  requirements  for  response  and recovery operations to an incident, emergency, disaster, or hostile attack.  5.2.  Installation Disaster Response Force.  The DoD, through DODI 6055.17, the NIMS, and the  NRF,  require  an  ICS  designed  to  enable  effective  and  efficient  incident  response  and recovery  management  by  integrating  a  combination  of  facilities,  equipment,  personnel, procedures,  and  communications  operating  within  a  common  organizational  structure.  The  AF DRF  supports  that  ICS  requirement.  For  additional  information  on  the  ICS  and  how  it  is  used within  the  AFIMS,  refer  to  AFMAN  10-2502.  The  DRF  encompasses  the  installation's  ICS, critical C2 nodes, responders, and support personnel.  5.2.1.  Each installation operating a CP will maintain and operate a single CP to support C2 activities/functions for all resident and tenant units/organizations. The CP is normally a full-time, 24/7 C2 node.  Installations without a 24/7 CP must identify an alternate C2 node that will operate until the CP function is recalled. (T-1). 5.2.2.  The  EOC  is  the  C2  support  element  that  coordinates  information  and  resources  to support the installation’s actions before, during, and after an incident at the operational level, and is the focal point for the development and coordination of the follow-on operations and recovery  plan.  The  installation  commander  activates  the  EOC,  which  operates  separately from the CAT. Table 5.1 defines the minimum COP criteria in the installation EOC.   56  AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 Table 5.1.  Minimum Installation EOC Common Operational Picture Criteria. EOC Common Operational Picture Criteria Interface with tactical (first responder) and operational (EOC) COPs. (T-1). Clearly articulate the situation, incident, emergency and provide effective critical information sharing. (T-1). Establish a means to monitor checklist progress, execution. (T-1). Visibility on resource management for resources required, utilized, during the incident, situation, event, etc. (T-1). Ability to list priorities for the current and next operational period. (T-1). Near real-time incident mapping display. (T-1). Identify all of the activated DRF elements. (T-1). Interoperable communications. (T-1). Capture and consolidate all directives originating from the CAT or EOC during the incident and have the means to track completion. (T-1). Provide installation C2 and emergency responders with an effective means to manage the emergency response, recovery actions and conduct interoperable levels of C2 among cross-functional DRF. (T-1). Provide the capability to consolidate Shared Situational Awareness for proper up-channeling IAW current AF SOPs as well as a lateral capability for an informational sharing capability with civilian counterparts. (T-1). 5.2.3.  The  CBRN  Control  Center  is  co-located  with  the  EOC  whenever  possible  and normally  operates  during  wartime  and  other  contingency  operations.  The  CBRN  Control Center is subordinate to and managed under ESF 5, Information and Planning. The Control Center  serves  as  a  CBRN  advisory  element  to  the  EOC  director  and  the  installation commander. The CBRN Control Center operates according to CCDR standards and reporting requirements  as  well  as  AFMAN  10-2503,  Ability  to  Survive  and  Operate  in  a  Chemical, Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear  (CBRN)  Environment,  and  AFTTP  (I)  3-2.56, Multiservice  Tactics,  Techniques  and  Procedures  for  CBRN  Contamination  Avoidance.  (T-1). 5.2.4.  For installations with an existing ECC, it provides emergency communications, alarm, sensor  and  video  monitoring,  incident/event  communications  support,  tactical  channel assignments,  emergency  notification  responder  reach-back  capability  during  emergencies, and notification of an emergency to the receiving MTFs. (T-1). The ECC is a 24/7 operation and  shall  include  the  core  functions  of  FES,  Base  Defense  Operations  Center,  and  Medical dispatch (where applicable). (T-1).   5.2.5.  The initial First Responder will formally transfer incident command to the IC.  (T-1). For example, Security Forces responds to an active shooter situation and the senior Security Forces  member  will  assume  IC  until  a  more  senior  trained  IC  arrives  on  scene.  Then  the Security  Forces  IC  briefs  the  more  senior  IC  and  transfers  command.  The  Security  Forces person  then  assumes  the  operations  branch  chief  position  to  provide  direct  tactical operational support to the IC.  5.2.6.  Specialized and Support/Recovery teams are formed from the existing installation and unit personnel resources to support emergency response operations.  AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 57 5.2.6.1.  EMST  is  a  trained  team  that  augments  the  R&EM  Flight  when  the  installation commander establishes an augmentee program. Identify sufficient EMST members based upon installation needs for incident response and wartime operations. (T-3). 5.2.6.2.  Units  that  have  threat-based  CCTs  include  LRS,  Maintenance,  Munitions, Medical,  and  CEs.  CCTs  are  required  to  perform  decontamination  on  assets  under  the control  of  their  functional  area  for  threat-determined  operations.  The  EOC  will  address peacetime  decontamination  requirements.  (T-1).  The  installation  commander  decides whether contamination control teams are established. Criteria for the decision are threat, contamination type, installation capabilities, mission impact, and if decontamination will reduce  protective  measures.  For  additional  information,  see  AFMAN  10-2503  and AFTTP 3-2.60, CBRN Decontamination.   5.2.6.3.  The  CCS  team  is  activated  by  the  EOC  Director  and  managed  by  the  CBRN Control Center. The CCS team will establish an area used at a nuclear weapons accident site or radiological incident location, where responders will be monitored for radiological contamination  and  decontaminated  as  appropriate  and  in  coordination  with  the Installation  Radiation  Safety  Officer.  Remove  and  dispose  of  contaminated  clothing, equipment, and materials. (T-1). 5.2.6.4.  CCA  teams  are  activated  by  the  EOC  Director  and  managed  by  the  CBRN Control  Center.  The  team  will  establish  an  area  where  CBRN  contaminated  IPE  is removed;  people,  equipment,  and  supplies  are  decontaminated  to  allow  processing between  a  toxic  environment  and  a  toxic  free  area;  and  people  exiting  a  toxic  free  area may safely don IPE. (T-1). 5.2.6.5.  IMTs  are  on-scene  teams  formed  from  various  DRF  components.  An  IMT  is  a comprehensive  team  that  includes  all  components  and  functions  of  the  Command  and General  Staff.  The  IMT  includes  the  pre-designated  command  staff  and  general  staff branch  chiefs  as  described  in  AFMAN  10-2502.  The  IMT  has  the  authority  and responsibility  to  manage  incidents  24/7/365  through  the  approval  of  the  installation commander.  5.2.6.5.1.  The  AF’s  concentration  will  be  on  Type  3  IMTs  due  to  the  severity  of  a Type 3 incident that could occur on or near an AF installation. Determination to have a Type 3 IMT is made by the installation's EMWG based on the installation’s Hazard Assessment.  5.3.  Initial Response Force.  Each installation will identify its capabilities as an IRF. (T-1). 5.3.1.  A DOD IRF is a tailored force dispatched from the closest military installation by the SecDef  or  by  the  CJCS,  through  the  Deputy  Director  of  Operations,  National  Joint Operations, and Intelligence Center, immediately upon notification of a U.S. nuclear weapon incident or nuclear or radiological incident.  5.3.2.  The  IRF  commander  is  the  DOD  IC  upon  arrival  at  the  accident  site  and  will  have single  incident  command  authority  over  DOD  assets  in  any  security  zone  that  is  under exclusive  DOD  jurisdiction.  The  DoD  IC  will  implement  guidance  and  requirements  as outlined in DODM 3150.08. 58 AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 5.3.3.  The AF will dispatch IMTs upon any incident, nuclear or non-nuclear, involving DOD resources (e.g., aircraft accident) as the IRF.  5.3.4.  The  IRF  mission  is  to  take  immediate  lifesaving  actions  and  establish  safety  and security controls at the accident scene. 5.4.  Response Task Force.  An RTF is a DOD response force appropriately staffed, trained, and equipped  to  coordinate  all  actions  necessary  to  control  and  recover  from  a  nuclear  weapon accident  or  incident.  The  specific  purpose  of  the  RTF  is  to  recover  weapons  and  provide radiological accident assistance.  5.4.1.  The  AF  maintains  two  RTFs.  The  USAFE  and  AFAFRICA  RTFs  support  the USEUCOM AOR and AFGSC supports all domestic nuclear weapons incident and accident responses.  5.4.2.  Upon  assumption  of  command,  the  RTF  will  incorporate  the  IRF  and  maintain communication  and  liaison  with  federal,  local,  state,  or  HN  authorities  established  by  the IRF.  After the transfer of command from the IRF to the RTF, the RTF commander becomes the DOD IC.   5.4.3.  The RTF is designed as a robust C2 element able to coordinate all interagency actions necessary  to  control  and  recover  from  a  nuclear  weapons  accident  or  incident  and  provide radiological accident assistance as per DODD 3150.08.  5.4.4.  The  RTF  may  be  activated  by  the  NMCC  or  SecDef  to  support  a  nuclear  weapons accident or incident of a weapon in DOE custody or an incident under Department of Justice (DOJ) lead.  5.4.5.  Upon notification from the NMCC, the AFSWC will notify AFGSC Command Center or  USAFE  Command  Center  to  place  the  RTF  on  immediate  deployment  warning  orders.  AFMC  Command  Center  will  also  be  notified  to  place  RTF  supporting  elements  on immediate deployment warning orders. 5.4.6.  After  NMCC  conducts  a  conference  call  according  to  DODM  3150.08,  SECAF  or CSAF will appoint the RTF commander and inform the owning MAJCOM/CC through the AFSWC. 5.4.7.  RTF  will  deploy  upon  authorization  of  NMCC  or  assigned  CCDR  according  to DODM 3150.08. 5.4.8.  AFCAT  and  the  activated  MAJCOM  CAT  will  coordinate  with  U.S.  Transportation Command and the 618th Tanker Airlift Control Center to identify needed airlift. 5.5.  Air  Force  Radiation  Assessment  Team.  AFRAT  acts  as  the  primary  USAF  worldwide consultant team for the DOD for radiological incidents and accidents, capable of providing on-scene  health  effects  expertise,  commander  guidance,  radiological  monitoring,  sampling,  and dosimetry. 5.5.1.  AFRAT  serves  as  an  expert  technical  liaison  to  CCDRs  or  lead  federal  agent  for contingency  support  and  CBRN  CM.  Provides  force  health  protection  oversight  through plume  modeling  and  risk  projection,  source  location  and  identification,  qualitative  field assessment, and protective action recommendations and risk communication.  AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 59 Section 5B—Installation Notification and Warning Systems. 5.6.  Installation  Notification  and Warning  System.  The INWS is a combination of methods using  audible  and  visual  signals,  verbal  messages,  and  electronic  communication.  Every  AF installation  must  have  an  INWS  with  the  capability  to  disseminate  rapidly  and  effectively  the emergency information to warn all personnel immediately, but no longer than 10 minutes, after incident notification and verification. See  Table 5.2 for components and minimum capabilities. (T-0) Table 5.2.  INWS Components and Capabilities (T-0). Audible and Visual Signals Components Sirens Portable PA systems Horns Mass Notification Systems  Outdoor “Giant Voice” systems Flags Electronic Communications: Network Broadcast System  Telephone Alert messages Television and Radio Reverse 911 Local Area Networking messaging Minimum Capabilities Standardize USAF emergency notification signals specific to disaster warnings, attack warnings, and “All Clear” procedures.  Standardize Attack warning signals for CBRN MTAs and HTAs specific to Alarm Conditions Green, Yellow, Red, and Black procedures. Disseminate MOPP procedures—MOPP Ready through MOPP-4. Disseminate Hurricane Condition/Tropical Storm Condition of Readiness (HURCON/TCCOR) if in a threat area. Provide watches, warnings, evacuation routes, and other alerting information to meet DoD and federal warning requirements.  Include all on and off-base agencies requiring support, to include swimming pools, golf courses, child care centers, etc.  Address unique populations (i.e., personnel with disabilities including motor, sensory, cognitive, and psychiatric impairments.) Use DoD-required individual building mass notification system (MNS) to disseminate EM information. MNS will be installed in most new and renovated buildings when necessary to meet DoD AT requirements.  Note: UFC 4-021-01, Design and O&M: Mass Notification Systems, and UFC 4-010-01, DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, provides details about warning standards. (T-0). 5.6.1.  Planners also consider the environment in which the INWS operates and ensures that all personnel can immediately hear or see status changes and take action. (T-1). For example, voice warnings must be audible to personnel inside facilities and over background noise such as air-conditioning units. Use visual warnings when audio signals interfere with operational security.  60 AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 5.6.2.  The  INWS  will  include  alarm  signals  and  notification  procedures.  These  signals  can be supplemented with signals compatible with local, national, HN, or theater systems. Follow command and theater guidance when more than one system applies. (T-1). 5.6.2.1.  Domestic  locations  must  use  installation  notification  and  warning  systems  that comply  with  DHS,  FEMA,  and  National  Weather  Service’s  Emergency  Managers Weather  Information  Network  and  the  Emergency  Alerting  System  alerting  methods, requirements,  and  capabilities.  Off-base  systems  are  the  responsibility  of  the  city  or county  EM  office.  CONUS  locations  will  work  with  the  city  or  county  EM  office  to synchronize weekly INWS checks. (T-0).  5.6.2.1.1.  "Be  Ready"  training  aids  entitled  U.S.  Air  Force  Emergency  Notification Signals, U.S. Air Force Attack Warning Signals for CBRNE Medium and High Threat Areas, and MOPP Mission Oriented Protective Postures provide standardization that must  be  used.  (T-1).  NOTE:  These  training  aids  supersede  AFVAs  10-2510,  10-2511, and 10-2512. 5.6.2.1.2.  These training aids are available as part of the AF “Be Ready” Awareness Campaign through the installation’s Office of Emergency Management. Training aids are  to  be  displayed  in  common  and  high  traffic  areas  across  the  installation.  (T-2). Display U.S. Air Force Emergency Notification Signals training aid at all installations worldwide,  while  U.S.  Air  Force  Standardized  Attack  Warning  Signals  for  CBRNE Medium  and  High  Threat  Areas  and  MOPP  Mission  Oriented  Protective  Postures training aids at installations with a CBRN medium or high threat. (T-2). 5.6.2.2.  Foreign locations must use warning systems and signals that are compatible with local,  HN,  or  theater  systems.  Follow  CCMD  or  DOS  guidance  when  more  than  one notification and warning system may be applied or is in operation. Alert, notification, and warning  methods  must  provide  both  overt  and  covert  notification  capability.  Warning systems  in  foreign  countries  should  broadcast  voice  messages  in  English  and  the predominant language of the local personnel working on base. (T-0). 5.6.2.3.  Deployable units should consult  plans  for specific signals  used  at  the deployed locations they support. For deployments to bare base locations, the communications unit must provide notification and warning systems. (T-0). Section 5C—Reporting Procedures. 5.7.  Air  Force  EM  Capability  Reports.  The  installation  commander  uses  various  reports related  to  the  AF  EM  Program  to  determine  the  installation’s  capability  to  accomplish  the mission. Table 5.3 provides a consolidated list of reports most directly related to readiness and the AF EM Program.  AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 61 Table 5.3.  R&EM Reports.  5.7.1.  With  the  information  in  these  reports,  the  commander  must  assess  installation resources, augmenting resources, and critical  capabilities available through the EMWG EM Program  status  updates,  MAAs,  or  commercial  sources.  (T-3).  Combining  these  resources should assist the installation in more closely achieving maximum response capability.  5.7.2.  Interagency  Combating  WMD  Database  of  Responsibilities,  Authorities,  and Capabilities Report.  5.7.3.  Activation  of  the  installation  EOC  for  real-world  incidents  or  events  requires  the Office of Emergency Management to notify their respective AFIMSC Detachment, AFIMSC and AFCEC/CXR within 24 hours. (T-1).  5.7.4.  Commanders must send an installation-wide After-Action Report to their MAJCOM, DRU,  and  AFCEC/CX  for  all  Type  I  –  III  emergency  responses  within  30  days  of demobilizing from the incident. (T-1).  5.8.  Lessons  Learned.  According  to  AFI  90-1601,  Air  Force  Lessons  Learned  Program,  the primary  method  for  submitting  observations  and  Air  Force  After  Action  Reports  (AFAARs)  is via AF-Joint Lessons Learned Information System (AF-JLLIS).  AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 5.8.1.  Organizations or individuals  use this method whenever possible to  submit individual lessons  or  AFAARs  to  their  appropriate  lessons  learned  office  (normally  the  A9L  for  that MAJCOM  or  Numbered  Air  Force,  or  direct  to  Air  Force  Lessons  Learned  where appropriate).  (T-1).  When  submitted  via  AF-JLLIS,  AFAARs  go  to  Air  Force  Lessons Learned  who  in  turn  forwards  them  to  the  appropriate  Numbered  Air  Force,  MAJCOM,  or AFIMSC  for  action.  The  intent  is  for  inputs  to  be  validated  at  the  appropriate  level  of  the submitting organization’s chain of command—the lessons learned process is not intended to be used to bypass the chain of command when submitting lessons.  62  JOHN B.

(JP 3-11/1-02) CBRN  High  Threat  Area  (HTA)—Based  on  a  process  developed  to  assess  threats  to  AF installations, some countries are assessed as HTA. Potential adversaries within the region either possess or are likely to possess a substantial stockpile of CBRN weapons and weapons systems and  may  have  special  operations  forces  capable  of  conducting  sustained  attacks  on  airbases. Forces are within immediate strike range of adversary theater missiles, and CBRN strikes using these  weapons  are  assumed  likely  to  occur.  AF  personnel  and  units  in  or  deployed  to  these locations  will  be  organized,  trained,  exercised,  and  equipped  to  survive  CBRN  attacks  and conduct sustained combat operations for greater than 24 hours in CBRN environments. CBRN  Low  Threat  Area  (LTA)—Friendly  forces  in  these  areas  are  at  risk  of  attack  with CBRN  weapons  by  transnationals.  Actual  or  potential  transnational  threats  exist  during peacetime  or  wartime.  Select  personnel  and  other  personnel  identified  in  IEMP  10-2  are organized,  trained,  and  equipped  to  continue  critical  missions  and  restore  the  primary  mission. All other personnel in these locations are trained to survive attacks. CBRN  Medium  Threat  Area  (MTA)—Based on a process  developed to  assess threats  to  AF installations, some countries are assessed as MTA. Potential adversaries within the region either possess or are likely to possess CBRN weapons and weapons systems and may also have special operations  forces  capable  of  conducting  limited  attacks  on  airbases.  Actual  or  potential transnational threats exist during peacetime or wartime. Forces may be within the extended range of adversary theater missiles, but it is assessed that CBRN strikes using these weapons are less likely  to  occur,  are  expected  to  be  fewer  in  quantity,  and/or  have  less  impact  on  personnel  or operations. AF personnel and units in or deployed to these locations will be organized, trained, exercised, and equipped to survive CBRN attacks and to conduct limited combat operations from between 6 to 24 hours in CBRN environments. Chemical  Warfare  (CW)—All  aspects  of  military  operations  involving  the  employment  of lethal and incapacitating munitions or agents and the warning and protective measures associated with  such  offensive  operations.  Because  riot  control  agents  and  herbicides  are  not  considered chemical warfare agents, those two items will be referred to separately or under the broader term “chemical”,  that  will  be used  to  include  all  types  of  chemical  munitions or  agents  collectively. See also JP 1-02.

It  includes the functions and duties of the commander as  well as the supporting functions and duties performed by the staff and others acting under the authority and direction of the commander. See also JP 1-02. Credentialed—A  person  who  possesses  the  requisite  knowledge  and  experience  to  perform mission  specific  tasks  under  emergency  conditions.  These  persons  may  provide  credentials identifying  them  as  qualified,  certified,  and  authorized  to  perform  a  mission-specific  task.  NOTE:  DoD currently has not established policy for Services to credential members. Crisis  Action Team (CAT)—A staff formed by the commander to plan, direct, and coordinate forces in response to contingencies, crises, natural/manmade disasters, or wartime situations. The CAT  develops  courses  of  action  and  executes  the  commander's  and  HHQ’s  directives.  The composition and function of the CAT is largely mission driven and therefore a MAJCOM or unit commander prerogative. However, membership for the CAT is most frequently a combination of the  commander’s  senior  staff  and  special  staff,  which  includes  a  CP  representative.  The 78 AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 composition  of  a  CAT  varies  according  to  the  situation.  The  CAT  is  scalable  to  support  and coordinate with the EOC.

(NIMS) (EMAC)—A  congressionally Emergency  Operations  Center  (EOC)—The  physical  location  at  which  the  coordination  of information  and  resources  to  support  incident  management  (on-scene  operations)  activities normally takes place. An EOC may be a temporary facility or may be located in a more central or  permanently  established  facility,  perhaps  at  a  higher  level  of  organization  within  a jurisdiction. EOCs may be organized by major functional disciplines (e.g., fire, law enforcement, medical  services), by  jurisdiction (e.g., federal,  state, regional, tribal,  city, county), or by some combination thereof. (NIMS) Emergency  Operations  Cell/Staff—The  Emergency  Operations  Cell/Staff  is  a  MAJCOM capability  that  supports  an  installation  EOC  when  a  Type  3  or  higher  incident  occurs  at  the installation. The MAJCOM commander recalls or activates the cell/staff as necessary and can be activated  with  or  without  the  MAJCOM  CAT.  The  cell/staff  updates  the  CAT,  or  MAJCOM leadership,  with  ongoing  incident  status  and  seeks  support  through  the  CAT  when  support requirements  surpass  the  MAJCOM’s  inherent  capability.  The  organization  of  the  MAJCOM Cell/Staff is flexible and scalable based on the severity of the incident and the capability of the installation being supported. Emergency  Responders—The  response  elements  of  a  DRF  that  deploy  to  the  incident  scene, after  First  Responders,  to  expand  resource  requirements  and  perform  support  functions  at  the request of the Incident Commander (IC). Emergency responders include follow-on elements such as  emergency  management  personnel,  EOD  personnel,  physicians,  nurses,  medical  treatment providers  at  medical  treatment  facilities,  public  health  officers,  BE  personnel,  and  mortuary affairs personnel (NIMS) Emergency Support Function (ESF)—Used by the (AF added: Air Force) federal government and many state governments as the primary mechanism at the operational level to organize and provide assistance. ESFs align categories of resources and provide strategic objectives for their use. ESFs utilize standardized resource management concepts such as typing, inventorying, and tracking  to  facilitate  the  dispatch,  deployment,  and  recovery  of  resources  before,  during,  and after an incident. (NRF.) For further information on ESFs and their function in the AF, refer to AFMAN 10-2502 Attachment 2. Environmental Sampling—Collecting environmental CBRN samples is described as obtaining a  representative  amount  of  the  CBRN  hazard  for  subsequent  analysis  later.  Environmental samples are used to determine if a CBRN material has BEn released into the environment. These samples include air, water, soil, and vegetation. They can include liquids, solids, or vapors. They do not include clinical/medical specimens.

First receivers are a subset of first responders. First  Responders—The DRF elements dispatched immediately to an incident scene to provide initial  C2,  to  save  lives,  to  suppress  and  control  hazards,  and  establish  the  incident  command system  (ICS).  First  responders  include  Fire  and  Emergency  Services,  Security  Forces,  and emergency medical  services personnel.   Note, all First  Responders are Emergency Responders, but  not  all  Emergency  Responders  are  First  Responders.  First  Responders  are  not  assigned augmentee duties or additional duties that will conflict with their emergency response duties. Force Protection—The AF defines FP as “the process of detecting threats and hazards to the Air Force and its mission, and applying measures to deter, pre-empt, negate or mitigate them based on an acceptable level of risk” and “[p]reventive measures taken to mitigate against Department of Defense personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information” (JP  3-0).  FP  is  a  fundamental  principle  of  all  military  operations  as  a  way  to  ensure  the survivability  of  a  commander’s  forces.  A  comparison  of  NATO,  joint,  and  single  Service definitions is instructive. NATO Doctrine explains that “[t]he operational environment may have no  discernable  ‘front  lines’  or  ‘rear  area’  and  an  adversary  may  be  expected  to  target  Allied vulnerabilities anywhere with a wide range of capabilities.” Consequently, NATO defines FP as “[m]easures  and  means  to  minimize  the  vulnerability  of  personnel,  facilities,  materiel, operations,  and  activities  from  threats  and  hazards  in  order  to  preserve  freedom  of  action  and operational  effectiveness  thereby  contributing  to  mission  success.”  Annex  3-10  to  AF  Core Doctrine, Vol 5, Chapter 4, Protect Forces Hazard  Assessment—A  DOD,  command,  or  unit-level  evaluation  (assessment)  to  identify hazards  and  associated  risk  to  person,  property,  and  structures  and  to  improve  protection  from natural  or  manmade  disasters  or  hazards.  Hazard  assessments  serve  as  one  of  the  foundational AFI10-2501  19 APRIL 2016 81 components  for  effective  EM  activities  including  planning,  resource  management,  capability development, public education, and training and exercises. Hazardous  Materials  (HAZMAT)—Any  material  that  is  flammable,  corrosive,  an  oxidizing agent, explosive, toxic, poisonous, etiological, radioactive, nuclear, unduly magnetic, a chemical agent, biological research material, compressed gases, or any other material that, because of its quantity, properties, or packaging, may endanger life or property.
