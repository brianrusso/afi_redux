Commanders and leaders at all levels should develop their Airmen to have awarrior mindset to help them survive when faced with an active shooter threat. Realistic trainingwill condition Airmen to fight through factors that may normally cause them to hesitate whenfaced with a threat. By employing realistic and practical training, we help Airmen understand thechanges that occur in the body and mind and by doing so, empower the warrior mindset. Thistraining should be part of a commander's home station responsibility and must not start or end atexpeditionary training centers. To meet this responsibility, it is imperative leaders understand howto appropriately conduct training and avoid conditioning and training pitfalls to increase chancesfor survival. The following term is included to clarify the scope of this AFTTP.1.1.1 Active Shooter. One or more subjects who participate in a shooting, random orsystematic, with the intent to continuously harm others. The term “active shooter” will alsoinclude anyone who uses any other deadly weapon (knife, club, bow and arrow, explosive,etc.) to commit the incident.1.2 The Mindset. The first step in enhancing an Airman's chances of survival is to activelydevelop and foster a warrior mindset. The need for all Airmen to possess a proper mindset isessential for their defense and the defense of their fellow Airmen.1.2.1 Warrior Mindset. The warrior mindset is more important than polished technique.When faced with an attack, act immediately and escape. Do not let anything get in your way ofsurvival or mission accomplishment. As Sir Winston Churchill said, “Never give in! Nevergive in! Never, never, never, give in except to convictions of honor and good sense.” Theessential components of the warrior mindset are: 1.2.1.1 Toughness. The uninhibited mental resolution to aggressively react to illegalviolence with a fierce and violent defense.1.2.1.2 Immediate Response. Respond immediately with the appropriate level of force.Stop the attack and escape or press forward with the mission. A warrior does not wait, asthe advantage is the surprise of instant and direct offense.1.2.1.3 Focus. Stay focused on your goal of survival and mission accomplishment. Bepersistent and continue to respond if the first response is not effective. Commit to yourgoal of survival and let nothing get in your way.1.3 Factors Causing Unnecessary Hesitation When Reacting to a Threat. There  are  manyfactors, which may cause Airmen to hesitate when faced with an active shooter threat such aspsychological inhibitions, personal beliefs, misunderstanding of the rules of engagement(ROE)/use of force policy, command policies, physiological changes, and prior training (or lackthereof). Commanders and leaders should provide training to mitigate the factors which causeunnecessary hesitation when reacting to a threat. This section discusses how commanders andAirmen can identify such factors, and develop an effective way of dealing with them to enablereasonable responses in use of force incidents.1.3.1 Psychological Inhibitions. Human beings, like most animal species, do not naturallyprey upon others in the same species. Humans have a natural inhibition to killing other human1-2AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 2012beings. As members of the Armed Forces, there are those times when we may be required totake another's life. Proper conditioning, mentally rehearsing a self-defense scenario, andmental commitment to the use of deadly force prior to the event can improve the ability ofAirmen to respond to acts of violence and fulfill this duty without unnecessary hesitation.1.3.2 Personal Beliefs. Airmen must resolve personal issues within themselves such ascommitment to mission, mortality, and willingness to sacrifice.1.3.2.1 Airmen must overcome the false belief of, “This could never happen to me.” Theactive shooter incidents in Fort Hood, Germany, and Afghanistan have proven any Airmanmay become the victim of an active shooter.1.3.2.2 Another belief, which may hinder an Airman's ability to react to violence, is thefalse assumption others will respond on their behalf (such as Air Force Security Forces).Incidents at Fort Hood, Germany, and Afghanistan have proven these acts of violence willbe well underway before emergency responders can respond to neutralize the threat andany Airman is a potential target. In most active shooter incidents, the person in the bestposition to stop the threat is the individual closest to the threat, to include the targetedvictim.1.3.2.3 An individual's religious preference may affect their ability to inflict aggression onothers. Airmen, who believe their religion prohibits the use of force, including deadlyforce, should consult guidance from a chaplain to resolve these issues. Airmen may causeharm to themselves or others if they unnecessarily hesitate.1.3.3 Understanding Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) and ROE. Airmen must be clear onthe right of individual defense and the defense of others. Unless otherwise directed by a unitcommander, Airmen may exercise individual self-defense in the response to a hostile act ordemonstrated hostile intent. Understanding the right of self defense may prevent unnecessaryhesitation and save their lives and the lives of their fellow Airmen. Each Airman, no matter thecareer field, duty position, or rank must feel confident their leadership, Air Force, andgovernment will protect them from legal harm if they appropriately use force to protectthemselves or their fellow Airmen. Commanders and leaders at all levels can overcome thishesitation by reinforcing the Airman's right to use all means necessary and appropriate forpersonal or unit self-defense and incorporate this information into training scenarios.1.3.4 Understanding the Application of Force. Some Airmen may believe that deadly forceis employed only as a last resort and used only when all lesser means are exhausted. Time andcircumstances permitting, Airmen should attempt to deescalate use of force situations;however, the use of deadly force may be a reasonable and appropriate first option if necessaryand proportionate to the threat encountered.1.3.4.1 A domino effect occurs when reasonable use of force is not applied immediately togain control or compliance. Circumstances of the incident become either more dangerous,out of control, or unmanageable for the personnel involved.1.3.4.2 An Airman's ability to determine a reasonable force option quickly erodes as thecomplexity of the decision and assessment process increases.AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20121-31.3.4.3 When reasonable force is applied immediately and without hesitation, theapplication of force results in fewer injuries to both Airmen and offenders. This is due to aquick ending and establishment of control.1.3.4.4 Airmen have no duty to retreat in an effort to avoid using force on a hostileaggressor when faced with a life-threatening act of violence. However, disengaging from athreat in order to gain a tactical advantage and put them into a position of advantage maybe a reasonable response to a critical incident depending upon the totality ofcircumstances.1.3.5 Local Command Policies. Commanders and local policies may unnecessarily restrictthe ability of Airmen to protect themselves or place them at a tactical disadvantage.Commanders are encouraged to evaluate local risks to forces before employing policies, whichrestrict an Airmen's ability to protect themselves (e.g., changes in arming status, restrictingtypes of weapons based on rank, preventing Airmen from carrying weapons). Additionally,commanders must consider factors that may place their subordinates at a tactical disadvantage(e.g., arming status other than what they are trained on, office lay out/design).1.3.6 Physiological Changes. When faced with a threat, Airmen need to understand certainphysiological changes may occur. These changes are triggered by the autonomic nervoussystem (ANS). The autonomic nervous system controls the parasympathetic and sympatheticnervous system, which are both involved in response to stress.1.3.6.1 The sympathetic nervous system initiates a defense mechanism referred to as the“fight or flight” response when you are stressed with the perception of death or seriousbodily harm. This response prepares the body for a survival reaction. A third responseknown as “freezing” could occur once the body's defense mechanism is activated. Thisresponse is important because it can affect an Airman's ability to react to the situation athand.1.3.6.2 Once the sympathetic nervous system is triggered, Airmen may experiencenegative effects in visual processing, motor skill performance, and cognitive processing.The following are physical responses to fear: 1.3.6.2.1 Pounding heart1.3.6.2.2 Muscle tension1.3.6.2.3 Trembling1.3.6.2.4 Rapid, shallow breathing1.3.6.2.5 Dizziness1.3.6.2.6 Nausea1.3.6.2.7 Gut wrenching knot1.3.6.2.8 Sweating 1.3.6.2.9 Dry mouth1.3.6.2.10 Goose bumps1.3.6.2.11 Tingling sensation in limbs and/or face1-4AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20121.3.6.2.12 Insensitive to pain1.3.6.2.13 Jumpy, easily startled1.3.6.2.14 Urge to urinate1.3.6.2.15 Urge to defecate1.3.6.2.16 Loss of fine motor skills1.3.6.2.17 Loss of complex motor skills1.3.6.2.18 Loss of depth perception1.3.6.2.19 Loss of near vision1.3.6.2.20 Increase in gross motor skills1.3.7 Perceptual Changes from Fear.1.3.7.1 Tunnel Vision. The loss of peripheral vision. Your field of vision may narrow tomere inches and you may lose depth perception and the ability to see what is behind thethreat.1.3.7.2 Heightened Visual Clarity. While experiencing tunnel vision, you may have a clearpicture of details you ordinarily might not notice or remember.1.3.7.3 Hearing Distortion. The most common hearing distortion is diminished sound,which may include a total loss of hearing to muffled and distant. You may not hear shotsbeing fired, people yelling at you, or sirens coming your way.1.3.7.4 Time Distortion. Things may seem to slow down (slow motion) or speed up.Airmen can experience both types of time distortion during the same incident.1.3.8 Cognitive/Behavioral Changes.1.3.8.1 Automatic Behavior. Most participants in a traumatic event give little or nothought to their behavior; they just instinctively do what their experience has programmedthem to do. This is why service members are told “you will do what you train to do, so trustyour training.” 1.3.8.2 Memory Gaps. It is normal when you are involved in a deadly force encounter tonot remember parts of what happened and parts of what you did. Memories of high threatsituations are often like a series of snapshots, some vivid, some blurry, and some evenmissing.1.3.8.3 Intrusive Thoughts. Sometimes you may have intrusive thoughts that may not beimmediately relevant to your current situation. You might think of your family, somefuture event, or a previous event that reminds you of the present one.1.3.9 Commander Considerations. The Air Force currently provides commanders andleaders with a wide array of training opportunities to aid in the development of the warriormindset. If commanders and leaders effectively execute existing training and avoid trainingpitfalls, these current opportunities expose Airmen to the desired conditioning needed. Thetraining is intended to: (1) expose the member to realistic situations they may experienceAFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20121-5operationally, and (2) condition them to respond appropriately under stress to prepare forfuture unknown challenges.1.3.10 Conditioning/Training Pitfalls. The three primary ways leaders improperly conditiontheir Airmen are: (1) unintentionally conditioning Airmen to react in an undesired manner, (2)relying on a single training event to yield desired operational capabilities, and (3) by excessiveuse of simulation of individual action during exercise scenarios.1.3.10.1 Unintentional Conditioning. Base X conducted operational readiness training byplacing Airmen in simulated combat scenarios during their field training exercises (FTX).All Airmen “deployed” to the FTX were issued weapons; however, only security forceswere issued blank ammunition. When the opposing forces (OPFOR) attacked the base,only security forces had the means to engage the enemy. This approach was theinstallation's standard training structure for years. A follow-on scenario was conducted ata training event where security forces were removed from the FTX and blank ammunitionwas issued to the remaining Airmen. When the base was under attack during the secondscenario, few Airmen engaged the OPFOR and some never even loaded their weapons.When the installation's Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) questioned the Airmen as to whythey had not engaged the active shooter, some responded they “forgot” they had a weapon.So what was the failure? The standard training conditioned the non-security forces Airmento not fight back even when attacked. In addition, Airmen were conditioned to view theirweapon as a burden rather than the key to their survival. These lessons were even moreimportant because this was not the intention of leadership.1.3.10.2 Relying on a single training event to yield desired operational capabilities. Theexecution of a singular training task in most cases will not yield an operational capability.Capabilities are normally developed through a continual developmental process ofinterrelated activities, concepts, and principles. For example, a commander wishes todevelop their Airmen's ability to engage a hostile threat with their weapon and uses AirForce weapons certification firing to meet this objective. This singular approach to trainingdoes not yield the desired capability because weapons certification provides the Airmenwith the intellectual ability of how to use a weapon, but it alone does not condition them tophysically (through muscle memory or stimulus response) and immediately react to athreat, nor does it cultivate the psychological mindset needed to react effectively toviolence.1.3.10.3 Excessive use of simulation of individual action during exercise scenarios.Realistic exercise scenarios may yield great benefits in conditioning the appropriateresponse. However, when individual actions are allowed to be simulated, the outcome isdegradation in appropriate conditioning. Excessive simulation of individual actionsconditions Airmen to ignore the initial warnings, hesitate in their actions (wait to hear thedirection to simulate), or not act at all. An installation may have a robust training andexercise program; however, if individuals are allowed to simulate their action then theexercise does little more than meet an annual exercise requirement rather than providingthe desired level of conditioning.1.3.10.4 Allowing Airmen to “lose” during training scenarios. One of the greatest benefitsof proper training is developing confidence in one’s skills and abilities. Conversely,1-6AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 2012developing training scenarios (particularly those associated with survival skills) whereAirmen are allowed to lose or fail creates doubt in their skills and abilities. When trainingAirmen, the training must condition them to win and allow them to believe if they executeas trained they will survive/win. Leaders who train Airmen and then place them inunwinnable scenarios not only undermine the value of the training, it allows Airmen todoubt their own abilities. This creation of doubt causes unnecessary hesitation when anAirman is required to take life saving actions. Leaders teach Airmen to survive and win,not to lose and die. There is time for lessons learned after the scenario. The simple rulehere is if Airmen execute as trained and conditioned, then they walk off the field after asurvival or combat scenario as a winner—every time.1.3.11 Appropriate Application of Training Elements. In order for training to be effective,it must focus less on task certification and more on conditioning the response of the Airmen.To develop a warrior mindset, training should condition the Airmen's physical, intellectual,and psychological abilities to react to violence.1.3.11.1 Physical Elements of Training. The physical elements of training achieve twoobjectives: (1) conditioning the Airmen to be physically capable to execute the task(physical fitness), and (2) the ability to react to the threat without hesitation during periodsof high stress (muscle memory). It is important to note that just because a training class isphysical in nature does not mean it meets the physical elements of training (physicalfitness or muscle memory). Courses that are physical in nature, but merely introduce orfamiliarize a task (e.g., annual weapons qualification, annual chemical warfare training)meet the intellectual elements of training. Examples of activities, which develop physicalelement, are:1.3.11.1.1 Proficiency drills (stimulus response)1.3.11.1.2 Quick reactionary weapons drills1.3.11.1.3 Physical fitness1.3.11.1.4 Weapons proficiency (not merely qualification)1.3.11.1.5 Combatives type training (must be routinely trained)1.3.11.2 The intellectual elements of training are to inform, familiarize, clarify, orintroduce subject matter required for a task. Examples of activities that develop intellectualelement are: 1.3.11.2.1 Understanding policies and procedures1.3.11.2.2 Understanding individual responsibilities1.3.11.2.3 Understanding of threat indicators 1.3.11.2.4 Understanding LOAC and ROE1.3.11.2.5 Annual weapons qualification1.3.11.2.6 Annual chemical warfare training1.3.11.2.7 Training which overcomes learned behaviors or inappropriate personalbeliefs (the “this could never happen to me” mentality)AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20121-71.3.11.3 Psychological Element of Training. The psychological elements of trainingcondition Airmen in three main areas to: (1) overcome physiological inhibitions, (2) fosterthe development of a desired mindset, and (3) overcome the physical, cognitive, andbehavioral responses of fear and stress. Some training designed to condition Airmenphysically can also yield psychological benefits. For example, using a virtual weaponstraining simulator achieves the physical element of weapons proficiency while theinterface with humanlike targets helps overcome the physiological inhibitions of engaginganother human. Additionally, physical training such as combatives helps develop themindset and will to fight while allowing Airmen to overcome fear of personal injury.Psychological training can help inoculate Airmen to the stress and fear of combat so theycan function during high stress situations by introducing them to the visual, audio, andsituational stimuli prior to an actual event. Lastly, preparing Airmen psychologicallyyields benefits beyond effectively reacting to enemy contact. This element of training canstrengthen Airmen resiliency and enhances survival after the fight. Examples of activities,which develop psychological elements, are:1.3.11.3.1 Combatives training1.3.11.3.2 Reality based training (dynamic and interactive)1.3.11.3.3 Continuous positive visualization1.3.11.3.4 Virtual simulation1.3.11.3.5 Live exercise (with realistic sounds, smells, sights, and scenarios)1.3.11.3.6 Stress Inoculation. Under high-stress conditions, over-learned behaviors(i.e., those previously experienced and repeatedly trained where limiteddecision-making is required) will be those easiest to use when it really matters,especially under challenging or adrenaline-inducing circumstances.1-8AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 2012THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANKAFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20122-1CHAPTER 2 ENHANCING RESILIENCY BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER AN ACTIVE SHOOTER RESPONSE2.1 Definition of Resilience. Resilience is the ability to respond, withstand, recover, and/or growin the face of stressors and changing demands. Resilience does not mean an absence of stress orfear. Resilience during an active shooter incident is about a process of performing under stress,resisting the effects it may have, and then recovering and restoring as needed. Practicalapplications and how to build resilience in preparation for, in response to, and after an activeshooter incident are both straightforward and complex. The following chapter highlightsopportunities for leaders to enhance these areas as well as address issues specific to active shooterresponse. This list is not meant to be exhaustive and commanders should adapt the information, asthey deem appropriate.2.2 Comprehensive Airmen Fitness. The foundations of resilience are physical, mental, social,and spiritual fitness, which is covered under Comprehensive Airmen Fitness. According toresearch, these domains include a number of areas in which there is an increase in the chance foran adaptive or resilient minded response during a stressful incident. The following list highlightsfactors under each of the areas that leaders must help strengthen equally to be optimally effective.Strengthening actions should focus on teams, units, families, and individual Airmen to beeffective.2.2.1 Physical. Includes physical fitness and wellness; as well as the physical strength,endurance, and physical skills to accomplish tasks.2.2.2 Mental. Familiarity with specific threat situations, necessary mental skills includingmental toughness, self-confidence and self-knowledge, overall psychological wellness,willpower, and fortitude.2.2.3 Spiritual. Resources outside oneself to build fortitude, sense of purpose and rightnessof mission and actions, as well as general spiritual fitness.2.2.4 Social. Trust in peers, family, organizations, leadership, desire to help others, andeffective utilization of support resources.2.3 Strategies to Strengthen Resilience.2.3.1 Recognition (Understanding Natural Threat Response). There will be a variety ofreactions during and after an active shooter incident particularly from those directly involvedin engaging the active shooter. It is important to normalize these reactions while making surethere are no particular issues of concern to be addressed. One way to look at a range ofresponses to the stressors of an active shooter incident is the continuum outlined below. SeeFigure 2.1, Combat and Operational Stress Continuum. Most individuals will respond in thegreen and yellow zone where some stress is expected due the natural survival response systembeing engaged.2.3.1.1 This continuum was modified from a United States (US) Navy/US Marine model.The only significant difference between the model below and the US Navy/US Marinemodel is that the US Navy has “Ready” as the “Green” category while “Responding” isemphasized in this model. Though readiness is implied in the model, in terms of reacting2-2AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 2012to stress it is important to emphasize that during stress one need not just react but alsorespond optimally because stress can enhance performance. The continuum is only meantas a gauge as it could be likely someone may be somewhere in between responding andreacting or reacting and a stress injury and the descriptions particularly in the greenthrough yellow can vary by individual. Table 2.1, Tactical Response Team (TRT) ZoneDescriptions, demonstrates how the TRT physiological stress response system (adrenalineand cortisol) and the mental controls work together to initiate a survival response.Figure 2.1 Combat and Operational Stress

3-4.6 14 Nov 20122-3Table 2.1 Tactical Response Team (TRT) Zone DescriptionsZoneResponding (Green)Reacting (Yellow) Injury (Orange)Illness (Red)DescriptionStress can help increase performance. Tactical, mental and physical skills are working in sync to optimize the Tactical Response Team (TRT) response to a threat such as an active shooter. There may be some fine motor skill deterioration, which is why effective training and practice is necessary to overcome this. Performance is at its peak when responding and the experience has been described as “Flow” or “Being in the Zone”.Depending on length or intensity of the stressor and preparation, optimal response to a threat will begin to decline at some point. Heart rate may be increasing beyond optimal levels and complex motor skills begin to deteriorate. Communication may begin to break down and the likelihood of mistakes will increase. An individual may actually feel the physiological effects of stress and might notice some decline in performance. For the better trained and more fit, the decline in performance may be delayed, but this varies by individual and depends on the situation. Whether responding or reacting to stress, some recovery may be needed.Stress injuries are different from stress reactions because although they are less common, anyone, even the most fit individual, can be at risk. Stress injury means there has been some damage because of the stress. The individual may no longer feel like him/herself. Stress injuries can heal but they can also leave scars because of the intensity of a stressor, but remember resilience does not mean an absence of scars. They can occur due to life threatening situations or where one has witnessed mass devastation, general fatigue from the wear and tear of mission grind, or because of the loss of someone or something, or shattered assumptions that affect ones values (e.g., having to shoot at children who are being used as combatants). It is possible to experience daily stress, be involved in a firefight, and witness the death of an innocent and have no ongoing problems or stress injury. It is normal to react to these events, and it is also possible for someone to experience a stress injury. A stress injury can be recovered from, but this can take days, weeks, or months. Results from an unhealed stress injury can be treated to facilitate recovery but will likely require assistance from a professional such as a psychologist. It is likely to significantly impact one or more areas of performance, and it is important for individuals, team members, and leaders to recognize where team members may fall along the continuum and take appropriate action.2-4AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20122.3.2 Performance Optimization (Thrive Under Threat).2.3.2.1 Training Overview. Optimal performance under challenging conditions requiresthe collaboration of technical, physical, and mental skill. Training plays an essential role indeveloping these skills and increases the likelihood they will be in sync when needed. 2.3.2.1.1 Three basic principles for training include:2.3.2.1.1.1 Making training as realistic as possible to minimize surprises whenengaging an active shooter. Varied scenarios and repeated practice are one way toaccomplish this. Intense surprises can be detrimental to psychological health.2.3.2.1.1.2 Training should be tough enough to push unit members to develop newskills but not so difficult they will fail to master the challenges or cause them toexperience stress injuries during training.2.3.2.1.1.3 Promoting communication peer to peer as well as leader tosubordinates through shared hardships as well as success is also important.2.3.2.2 Training Suggestions.2.3.2.2.1 Training should entail an understanding of what happens physiologically andpsychologically under such situations (i.e., the natural survival response and what thatfeels and looks like). This is important to normalize any reactions but also make awarethe impact of this natural reaction can be managed.2.3.2.2.2 Before active shooter scenarios, mental toughness skills should also betaught as these are tools that can be used to manage threat response with the aim tobuild a warrior mindset.2.3.2.2.3 Events after an active shooter incident can be just as stressful as the incidentitself; therefore, a scenario should include realistic debriefing by individuals role-playing Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) or commanders so theycan be exposed to what the event will entail. It can take some time to regulate down thestress chemicals in the body, so having to practice responding to the aftermath of anactive shooter incident is critical.2.3.3 Building Protection (Bend Under Threat).2.3.3.1 Training helps to optimize performance and may build some protection against thestress of responding to an active shooter. As stated previously, good preparation increasesconfidence and helps an individual manage their response system. Training is also one wayfor teams to practice working together and supporting each other during and after anintense situation. If a scenario would include a range of expected reactions after an activeshooter incident (e.g., someone who is struggling because they may have had to take a life,or someone not having difficulties except for the stress of the inquiry afterwards) thiswould allow for individuals and teams to practice how they would respond and supportthat individual.2.3.3.2 Unit cohesion and social support are key factors in promoting resilience. It can bedeveloped through communication, trust, respect, loyalty, and familiarity. The moreopportunities to face challenges successfully through training and other shared activities,AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20122-5the more likely cohesion can be built. After action reports (AAR) after an incident mayalso be an opportunity to facilitate social support.2.3.4 Restoration (Recovering After Responding to Threat).2.3.4.1 There may be a variety of responses after an active shooter incident from noreaction, to an excitement because of adrenaline or fatigue, and confusion. Any one ofthese is normal, but because physical and mental energy is expended, recovery is neededeven if no injury is sustained. This could be as simple as rest and sleep, good food, and anopportunity to socialize. If a stress reaction continues (yellow) or a stress injury hasoccurred/developed, ensuring that individual gets the proper support needed is essential.Getting a stress injury attended to should be no different from having a physical injurymanaged and leadership should promote a culture where this care is acceptable andexpected for continued mission success and individual performance.2.4 Tactical Mental Toughness Skills. These skills are designed to optimize performance andenhance resilience. Mental toughness focuses on two primary aspects: composure andconcentration. During an active shooter incident, this translates into: does an individual payattention to what matters and can they do what is necessary without allowing emotions to controltheir actions? Below are some mental toughness skills that may be utilized to enhance resilienceand performance under intense stress such as active shooter response.2.4.1 Tactical Breathing. Tactical breathing is a technique employed to consciously controlbreathing to overcome or prevent the physical effects of stress. To execute tactical breathing,you inhale through your nose to the count of four seconds, hold your breath for four seconds,exhale through your mouth slowly for four seconds, and hold your breath for four seconds.2.4.2 Warrior Mindset. Strong sense of purpose, clear values that drive action, commitmentto appropriate action to achieve goals, not giving up.2.4.3 Attention Management. Internal and external awareness, ability to reduce unhelpfulmental static.2.5 Lesson on Survival Response. First, it is important to understand how the body reacts whenit faces any kind of real or perceived threat so one can anticipate those expected effects andrecognize when natural physiological reactions are either increasing or hindering an optimalresponse. Early recognition allows for adjustment to enhance the possibility of an optimalresponse and outcome. When a threat is perceived, the brain (primarily the amygdala responsiblefor fear response) sends signals to structures in the brain that secrete stress response chemicals—adrenaline and cortisol. This physiological response is an essential part of a TRT we have builtinto our system to respond to threats. “You may see a muzzle flash, as if in stop action, or even seea bullet in the air or you may have a vivid image of the gun, or even a ring on the suspect's hand,but not remember his face” (Artwohl & Christensen, 1997, p.40). This quote is describing theexperience of tunnel vision, which can result naturally as the body's natural defense system kicksin. The tunnel vision we experience in dangerous situations, and the physical changes going alongwith it, are all natural processes designed to help keep us alive. Although this survival mechanismis extremely important and useful, if left unchecked it can actually cause a decline in performanceand lead to health-related problems. Learning to manage your TRT system can therefore be alife-saving skill.2-6AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20122.5.1 Adrenaline and Cortisol. Adrenaline and cortisol increase blood sugar, blood pressure,and heart rate amongst other physiological responses in an effort to initiate our fight or flightresponse. Examples of how this can help include stories of people being able to suddenly liftheavy objects, running faster, etc. There can also be negative effects if the TRT is alwaysresponding or responding incorrectly, which can hurt long-term sustained performance. It ispossible for the TRT to get overloaded or overrun quickly and without warning particularlyunder extreme conditions. This can be helped by proper training and preparation includingmental preparation.2.5.2 Heart Rate. The stress response chemical, adrenaline, affects heart rate making it agood but not a perfect gauge of the stress response. When at rest, our heart rate is typicallybetween 60 to 80 beats per minute (BPM). At around 115 BPM, we start to lose control of finemotor skills. At around 145 BPM, our complex motor skills deteriorate. This includeshand-eye coordination and multitasking. Above 175 BPM, our brain stops processinginformation and we start to feel the physical effects of tunnel vision. Above 175 BPM is wherewe see undesirable combat behaviors, including submission and/or flight when doing so isinappropriate.2.5.3 Controlling Heart Rate. During an active shooter incident, it is important to be able tocontrol your heart rate between 115 to 145 BPM where mental processes are sharpest. Becausethis optimal zone is also at the level where we experience fine motor skill deterioration, theseskill should be practiced over and over again to make sure these physical problems can beovercome. These mental effects occur only as a result of adrenaline-induced heart rateincreases. Elevating your heart rate during exercise, for example, will not cause tunnel vision.It is important to note that physiological response system does not distinguish between dailyand operational stressors or real threats (active shooter) versus perceived threats (“I might lookbad if I don't respond well”).2.5.4 Fear and Rage Responses. There is another part of the brain (the limbic system)involved in memory, learning, and emotional ties, particularly to the fear response. Fear andrage to some degree are part of the survival response. However, the system within our brain forthis is fairly primitive and these emotions can be quite raw, overpowering, and negativelyimpact performance if not regulated. This can lead to impaired decision making and reducesthe ability to utilize fine motor skills. Fear and rage are natural emotions, part of our survivalsystem, and efforts should not be to eliminate or suppress them but rather to regulate them foran optimal response.2.5.5 Controlling Thoughts. The thinking part of the TRT is primarily in the frontal lobesand can help optimize our response by leveraging the body's natural survival response system.This part of the team is responsible for higher order function like decision-making, impulsecontrol, and the regulation of emotions. Instead of reacting, it allows the TRT to ACT (ACT=adrenaline + cortisol + thought) purposefully and sets us apart from animals who also have aningrained flight or fight response. It is important to note that our thoughts can also have anegative impact on our ability to respond optimally. For instance if we feel unprepared ordoubt our ability, we essentially create “mental static” distracting us from the task at hand andreduces our ability to perform optimally.AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20122-72.5.6 TRT Activation. If your TRT is not activated when you need it, you will tend to feelfatigued, exhausted, and not perform very well. It is almost as though you are asleep at thewheel. As the TRT engages to meet the challenge, you will perform better. However if yourTRT is too high, your performance will be degraded due to agitation, sleep problems, anddistractibility. Over the long term, if a TRT remains in overdrive for too long, it can have anegative impact on your health. In fact, your body can forget how to turn it off, and you canstart experiencing physical and mental health problems that interfere with your dailyperformance.2-8AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 2012THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANKAFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20123-1CHAPTER 3WEAPONS PROFICIENCY3.1 Weapons Proficiency. Over the past couple of decades, United States Air Force (USAF)ground combat missions have changed dramatically. Our operations are no longer confined to theair base or limited to primarily defensive operations. We are involved in many outside the wiremissions, as well as embedded with sister Services and performing more direct combat functionsthan ever. Additionally, active shooter incidents like those in Germany and Afghanistan serve asgrim reminders that all Airmen are susceptible to attack. These factors direct a fundamentalchange in the way our Airmen view their need to maintain proficiency with small arms/lightweapons and the way leadership emphasizes the criticality of these skills. Commanders,supervisors, and trainers must ensure weapon training extends beyond qualification trainingprovided by combat arms. They should implement unit level weapons proficiency and sustainmentprograms to facilitate improved weapons handling skills, tactical movement, weapons retention,and performing assigned duties while bearing arms. Commanders have many options, rangingfrom live-fire weapons qualification to knowledge level training using existing Air Force policiesand resources. Three key publications guiding Air Force weapons training and handling policiesare AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, AFI 36-2226, Combat ArmsProgram, and AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual.3.2 Weapons Qualification. Air Force personnel with an in-garrison arming requirement or aredeploying to a contingency operation must complete qualification training conducted by Air ForceCombat Arms on the weapon(s) and equipment they will use while armed. As an example, allAirmen are required to conduct rifle/carbine qualification training with individual combatequipment and using any authorized accessories they will use when armed. During handgunqualification training, Airmen must use the authorized type of holster in the configuration theywill use while carrying the weapon. The Air Force small arms training infrastructure (ranges andclassroom training facilities) cannot support live-fire qualification and proficiency training for allAirmen. Therefore, the Air Force has developed qualification-training policies focusing on thoseAirmen with the greatest need to maintain weapons proficiency. The Air Force classifiesindividuals into one of two arming groups based on their need to be armed or potential for armedconflict, Group A and Group B.3.2.1 Group A Personnel. Group A personnel are those individuals who are serving in an AirForce specialty code (AFSC) that specifies qualification to bear firearms as a mandatoryrequirement, those who are armed in-garrison, and those with a higher potential for armedconflict. Examples of Group A personnel are security forces, AFOSI agents, battlefieldAirmen specialties, and security force augmentees.3.2.1.1 These individuals must complete qualification training annually on all weaponswith which they are or will be armed.3.2.1.2 Additionally, security forces and battlefield Airmen specialties must complete unitlevel live-fire sustainment training five to seven months after completing qualificationtraining each year. 3.2.2 Group B Personnel. Group B personnel are those individuals other than Group A whoare required to be armed as designated by deployment orders to meet Air Force War and3-2AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 2012Mobilization Plan or Air Expeditionary Force unit type code (UTC) deployment requirementsand have no in-garrison or peacetime arming requirement.3.2.2.1 Group B individuals complete qualification training only when they are actuallytasked to deploy to a contingency operation.3.2.2.2 Commanders may designate up to 10 percent of Group B personnel assigned to aUTC with a designed operational capability (DOC) statement requiring a 72 hour or lessresponse time, or units with a Joint Mission Tasking/Charter, to complete annualpre-deployment qualification training. This allows these individuals to maintain readinesswhen short-notice qualification training is not feasible.3.2.2.3 Although requiring all Airmen to complete some form of weapons training on arecurring basis is desirable, live fire training is not feasible for most units. Therefore,commanders and supervisors must develop creative solutions to address weapons skillsneeded for their Airmen relevant to the duties they are expected to perform. 3.3 Unit Sustainment Training Programs. Commanders have several options for implementingunit sustainment training programs. Some Group A personnel are required to conduct live fireproficiency with their assigned weapons at recurring times. Other units are authorized proficiencymunitions to hone their skills. Units that do not have assigned weapons or munitionsauthorizations have resources available they can use to increase weapons handling andproficiency. 3.3.1 Live-Fire Sustainment Training. AFI  36-2226  allows  users  with  authorizedproficiency ammunition to create a weapons training program more in-line with theiroperational needs. This effort does not replace periodic Air Force weapons qualificationrequirements but is additional training to maintain perishable skills by affording personnelmore live-fire time. Individuals must be currently qualified on the weapon prior toparticipating in the live-fire proficiency/ sustainment program. Only combat arms personnelare authorized to conduct weapons qualification training, but anyone certified as a rangeofficial by the combat arms noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC), as outlined in AFI36-2226, can conduct live-fire proficiency or sustainment training.3.3.1.1 Units with authorized proficiency munitions may use Air Force small arms rangesto conduct their proficiency/sustainment training on an as available basis. The combatarms NCOIC will establish procedures for scheduling and use of the firing range.Individuals who will use the range must meet all range safety official training requirementoutlined in AFI 36-2226.3.3.1.2 Before conducting live fire training, combat arms must approve courses/type offire for each weapon used to ensure the proposed course of fire does not exceed the safetylimits of the range.3.3.1.3 The unit training section can establish a unit level proficiency weapons trainingprogram at the discretion of the unit commander in accordance with AFI 36-2226. Thisprogram should focus training on advanced weapons tactics, techniques, and procedures.This program should also be progressive in nature to encourage a continual improvementin weapons handling skills and tactics proficiency.AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20123-33.3.1.4 Another option for units with access to weapons may be developing unit trainingprograms utilizing close combat mission capability kits (CCMCK). The CCMCK is atemporary modification to the M9 and/or M16/M4 that allows firing of dye-markingrounds and prevents chambering or firing of live rounds. These non-lethal rounds allowforce-on-force training and can be used for limited marksmanship training. There aretraining and certification requirements for individuals who conduct training withCCMCKs and safety previsions for performing the training. These requirements areincluded in the Headquarters Air Force Security Forces Center (HQ AFSFC) CCMCKTraining Concept of Operations (CONOPS). 3.3.2 Unit Sustainment Training (Non Live-Fire). Unit  commanders  may  institute  aweapons training program that does not include live-fire. This training will help personnelmaintain perishable skills by affording individuals increased weapons training. When units useoperational weapons for this type training, unit trainers must be qualified on the weapon(s)prior to conducting training. Individuals are not required to be qualified in order to participatein non-live-fire small arms training. For this initiative to be effective, unit commanders,supervisors, and trainers must be open-minded and creative without sacrificing safety.3.3.2.1 If weapons are available, units can conduct mechanical weapons training. Thistype of training is a highly effective way to increase weapons familiarity and should beaccomplished at unit level by noncommissioned officers (NCO) qualified on the weapon.Skills such as loading, clearing, and immediate action can be instructed and practiced withdummy rounds or empty magazines. Training can also include disassembly, assembly andcare/cleaning procedures. AFPAM 10-100, Airman's Manual, is a readily availablereference and contains a weapon skills section that unit NCOs can use to provide unit leveltraining on the M9 pistol and the M16/M4 rifle/carbine.3.3.2.2 Virtual Training Systems (VTS). This type of training is an efficient and time/costeffective tool that provides real world training at the unit level in marksmanship, use offorce, theater or command specific ROE, and tactical and judgmental scenarios. VTS arevery good for initial through advanced marksmanship and remedial training. Personnel areencouraged to utilize VTS to practice marksmanship fundamentals prior to qualificationtraining. Approved courseware is authorized for Air Force use and encouraged for trainingat the unit level.3.3.2.3 Computer Based Training (CBT). Modules for the M16 rifle and M9 pistol areavailable on the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) Advanced DistributedLearning System website and individuals are encouraged to complete these courses priorto attending combat arms qualification training. Additionally, commanders and unittraining personnel may use this training to augment qualification training and as part ofunit sustainment training programs.3.3.2.4 Units can purchase and incorporate firearms replicas (plastic guns) into localexercises and train on weapons handling and movement techniques, as well asindividual/group security procedures for protecting weapons. Replica weapons must be ofa color that is easily identifiable as not being a real weapon, such as red or blue. Units mustsecure and account for these training devices when not in use.3-4AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20123.3.2.5 Another easily implemented training option is mandated self-study or grouptraining on the weapon skills section of AFPAM 10-100. This can help to keep individuals'weapons knowledge at a more proficient level. Additional training references include HQAFSFC rifle/carbine and handgun instructor guides (available on the US Air ForceCombat Arms Community of Practice [CoP]) and US Army Field Manuals, whichindividuals may obtain from the Army Knowledge Online site. These publications arereadily available and provide excellent sources for unit training programs.3.4 Arming Standards and Configurations. AFI 31-117 contains guidance on Air Force armingstandards, requirements, and suitability standards. Commanders should use this publication as areference for questions on these topics. AFMAN 31-229 includes the Air Force approved loadingand clearing procedures for all standard Air Force weapons. This is the sole reference forapproved weapons handling procedures and is a valuable reference for unit training.3.5 Small Arms and Related Equipment. The HQ AFSFC is the lead for US Air Force smallarms/light weapons and related equipment requirements for all Air Force users.3.5.1 Commercial Weapons. Units are not authorized to procure commercial weapons parts,accessories (e.g., grips, slings, holsters, lights) or use/attach/install any items on an Air Forceweapon not approved by HQ AFSFC and the Air Force Small Arms Program Office. The basecombat arms section is the focal point for all authorized weapon parts procurement andreplacement. Additionally, the base combat arms section is the only organization authorized toperform any maintenance above operator level as indicated in the applicable weapon technicalorder.3.5.2 Authorized Small Arms. HQ AFSFC/SFXW maintains a listing of authorized AirForce small arms and light weapons accessories on their CoP site or through installationCATM section. Commanders must ensure that individuals do not install any unapproved itemson Air Force weapons. The use of non-military specification parts/accessories or items thathave not been adequately tested may interfere with the proper operation of the weapon or theweapon may fail during use placing the user at risk. Additionally, HQ AFSFC develops allqualification training for these approved items. Allowing individuals to use items withoutproper training may also place them at risk.3.6 Summary. This chapter provides Air Force leaders with a general background on Air Forceweapons qualification training policies and current options for providing increased weaponstraining at unit level. If leaders embrace the concept that weapons proficiency is a core Air Forceskill and implement some of these options, Airmen will receive increased and enhanced trainingon weapons, thus improving their combat capability and survivability.AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20124-1IDENTIFICATION, PREVENTION, AND DISSEMINATION CHAPTER 44.1 Identification, Prevention, and Dissemination. Active shooter incidents are incrediblydangerous and difficult because there is no criminal objective (e.g., robbery, hostage taking)involved other than violence. Often, the shooter has no regard for their life, and may be planningto die. These factors leave responding forces little recourse but to locate and stop the shooter asquickly as possible. As a result, installation commanders are encouraged to not only focus on theirreadiness to respond to these types of incidents, but to also focus planning efforts on mitigating thethreat through awareness training. This training should be geared toward detecting behaviorsindicative of an individual's propensity for violence and ensure sufficient dissemination of thisinformation. This chapter focuses on mitigating threats through awareness training for behavioralindicators of violence, preventive efforts to mitigate the active shooter threat in a deployedenvironment, and dissemination/information sharing.4.2 Cultural Awareness. A red team study of mutual perceptions of Afghan National SecurityForce personnel and US Army Soldiers titled “A Crisis of Trust and Cultural Incompatibility”(author Jeffrey Bordin, 12 May 2011) indicated a pervasive and progressive insider threat thatmust be addressed. The author of the study came to a series of conclusions and recommendationsto be considered as universally applicable regardless of the deployment area of responsibility(AOR).4.2.1 Cultural Awareness Training. Increase the emphasis on cultural awareness training.While cultural awareness training is provided at many of our pre-deployment training venues,it seemingly falls short based on the findings of this study. Specifically, the training must notonly focus on awareness of the host nation (HN) culture, but on what our forces should avoiddoing that may be perceived as offensive to the HN. An effective way of imparting thistraining at pre-deployment training venues is through scenario based conflict resolutiontraining. Scenarios should be as realistic as possible and, when available, should use actorsthoroughly familiar with the HN cultural differences and spoken language.4.2.2 Mental Preparation. Mentally prepare our forces for the extreme cultural and societaldifferences they can expect to encounter. Many cultural or societal norms, such as animalmistreatment or subservient treatment of females and children, are morally offensive to ourforces and often result in significant animosity between US and HN forces working in closeproximity. This training should not focus on attempting to rationalize these types of behaviors;rather it should focus on conditioning our forces to react professionally versus emotionally intheir response. Our forces must understand reacting with aggression or anger could precipitatea violent response, prompting unprofessional responses at a minimum and at worst anunnecessary liability to our forces. Reinforce the need for our forces to “police” themselvesand correct anyone demonstrating actions or attitudes that may result in a liability to friendlyforces (e.g., profanity, disrespect, lack of professionalism).4.2.3 US Policy. Leaders must be continually aware of US policy changes and how HN forcesmay perceive those changes. For example, a US policy addressing fiscal constraints such asdecreasing funding to HN training programs may be perceived by HN forces as a lack of trust4-2AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 2012or loss of confidence in their abilities. Leaders must make every effort to communicate policyor procedural changes, to the extent possible, with HN forces to mitigate those perceptions.4.2.4 Host Nation. Leaders must be familiar with and have a conduit for feedback on theorganizational climate of HN units and the local HN culture and patterns of daily living. Thisawareness can help spotlight areas of concern prior to escalation into an act of violence.Particular attention should be paid to HN units and local HN patterns of living after asignificant event such as media reported civilian casualties. Often these events can be thecatalyst for violent responses.4.2.5 Advanced Planning. Advance planning is necessary to eliminate or mediate thoseactions that HN forces may find offensive. Examples include conducting combined US/HNawareness training aimed at explaining cultural differences and behaviors to head off anypotential conflict. The intent of this combined training should be to facilitate communicationand afford both sides the opportunity to air grievances.4.2.6 Observation. Train US Forces to be observant of behavioral indicators that may beindicative of a HN forces potential for violence or fratricide.4.3 Preventive Efforts. Prevention starts with the ability to detect potential threats. Numerousdocumented case studies exist to indicate trends of behavior demonstrated prior to violent actionstaken by an active shooter or other insider threats. Paragraph 4.4 below standardizes theseindicators and facilitates training, detection, and reporting. These indicators are specific actions,behaviors, or activities correlating to the fourteen categories of suspicious activity and mayindicate an individual's propensity for violence. It is imperative for leaders to educate theirpersonnel on these indicators through systematic awareness briefings and recurring training.Specific awareness training should be developed locally and contain a brief historical review ofpast incidents, but primarily focus on what actions our forces should take if they observe unusualbehavior by an individual that may indicate a propensity for violence. 4.3.1 Recognize Potential Threat Indicators. The people most likely to recognize potentialthreat indicators are those working in close proximity with the individual. Leaders are chargedwith educating the force and enabling our forces to report individuals exhibiting behavioralindicators indicative of violence, terrorist, or criminal activity. Educating our personnel torefer these individuals for additional law enforcement intervention or assistance enhances theoverall integrated defense posture of an installation.4.3.2 Reporting and Response. All reporting and response actions will be based on specificobserved behaviors and other indicators of possible threats. The indicators contained withinparagraph 4.4 are not all inclusive and may not be independently actionable; commanders areencouraged to localize these lists based on permissive environments, non-permissiveenvironments, and cultural variations as dictated by the operating environment.4.4 Behavioral Threat Indicators. This list is a compilation of behavioral threat indicatorsderived from credible open source documents from various Department of Defense (DOD),Department of State (DOS), Department of Justice (DOJ), state, and university studies ordirectives. This list is not all inclusive, but provides the foundation for indicator detection andreporting. If an individual demonstrates one or multiple indicators, this information should beAFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20124-3shared up the chain of command. If the individual is demonstrating an immediate threat ofviolence, contact the appropriate law enforcement agencies.NOTE: Not all indicators are independently actionable, but when put to together or demonstratedin conjunction with one another, they could indicate a threat. Leaders must consider culturalnorms as part of their evaluation of reported indicators.4.4.1 Overt Indicators - Preparations/Activities.4.4.1.1 Statements/actions indicating discontent with how US Forces perform theirmission (e.g., not asking HN permission prior to taking actions, shaming the HN forcesthrough disarming/search/seizure of cell phones at entry control points [ECP],indiscriminate weapons employment).4.4.1.2 Statements/actions indicating real/perceived cultural disrespect by US Forces(e.g., passing gas in public, excessive profanity, searching elders, sitting with legs open,bullying by US Forces, wearing sunglasses when meeting with elders, disrespectingfemales, public urination, causing shame to HN forces).4.4.1.3 Statements/actions concerning a perceived lack of accountability of US Forcesbelieved to have committed injustices to HN civilians or HN forces.4.4.1.4 Statements/actions indicating a perceived lack of mutual respect in combatengagements (e.g., retreating and leaving HN forces behind, no air support for HN forcesacting alone).4.4.1.5 Statements/actions indicating HN perception that US Forces fail to deliver onpromises (e.g., village developments, supplies).4.4.1.6 Suspicious absence of senior leaders during routine meetings or gatherings theywould normally attend (studies indicate this may be indicative of potential violence aboutto occur).4.4.1.7 Suspicious actions or behavior that represent a clear departure from norms (e.g.,individual is clean shaven and hygienic when typically has facial hair and lacks hygiene). 4.4.1.8 Talk knowingly about a future terrorist event, as though the person has insideinformation about what is going to happen.4.4.1.9 Statement of intent to commit or threatening to commit a terrorist act, whetherserious or supposedly as a “joke,” and regardless of whether or not you think the personintends to carry out the action.4.4.1.10 Deliberate probing of security responses, such as deliberately causing a falsealarm, faked accidental entry to an unauthorized area, or other suspicious activity designedto test security responses without prior authorization.4.4.1.11 Statements of support for suicide bombers who have attacked the United States orUS personnel or interests abroad.4.4.1.12 Expressing sympathy for violence promoting organizations.4.4.1.13 Advocating violence, the threat of violence, or use of force to achieve goals thatare political, religious, or ideological in nature.4-4AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20124.4.1.14 Advocating support for international terrorist organizations or objectives.4.4.1.15 A threat to DOD personnel or threatened damage to or compromise of a DODfacility or infrastructure.4.4.1.16 Statements that the US Government (USG) is trying to destroy or suppresspeople of a particular race, religion, or ethnicity (for example, statements that the USG isengaging in a crusade against a faith or destroying the purity of a culture or race).4.4.1.17 Distribution of extremist publications or posting information on the Internet,including e-mail and on-line discussions, which supports or encourages violence or otherillegal activity. Frequent viewing of web sites that promote extremist or violent activity(unless this is part of one's job or academic study).4.4.1.18 Advocating or participating in violence against any individual based on theirrace, creed, color, sexual orientation, religion, or national origin.4.4.1.19 Statements of support for violence against US military forces either at home ordeployed abroad.4.4.1.20 Expressing outrage against US military operations.4.4.1.21 Seeking spiritual sanctioning for unlawful violence.4.4.1.22 Providing financial or other material support to a terrorist organization or tosomeone suspected of being a terrorist.4.4.1.23 Family ties to known or suspected international terrorist or terrorist supporters.4.4.1.24 Statements about having a bomb or biological or chemical weapon, about havingor getting the materials to make such a device, or about learning how to make or use anysuch device-when this is unrelated to the person's job duties.4.4.1.25 For US military personnel only: Any action that advises, counsels, urges, or inany manner causes or attempts to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal ofduty by any member of the armed forces of the US.4.4.2 Covert Indicators - Subversive Activities.4.4.2.1 Suspicious questioning of personnel by any means about particular DODstructures, functions, personnel, or procedures at the facility or infrastructure.4.4.2.2 Monitoring the activity of DOD personnel, facilities, processes, or systems,including showing unusual interest in a facility, infrastructure, or personnel (e.g.,observation through binoculars, taking notes, drawing maps or diagrams of a facility, andtaking pictures or video of a facility, infrastructure, personnel, or the surroundingenvironment) under circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to perceive athreat to DOD personnel, facilities, or forces in transit.4.4.2.3 Collection of unclassified information that might be useful to someone planning aterrorist attack, (e.g., pipeline locations, airport control procedures, building plans) whenthis is unrelated to the person's job or other known interests.4.4.2.4 Inappropriate, unusual, or excessive interest in classified information (outsidecurrent assignment or without the “need to know”).AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20124-54.4.2.5 Mishandling of classified information to include revelations to unauthorizedpersonnel, leaks to media, unauthorized contact with media, unauthorized removals,collecting or storing outside of approved facilities, or lax security protocols.4.4.2.6 Misuse of computers/technology to include accessing databases withoutauthorization, unauthorized searching or browsing through computer libraries, orunauthorized destruction of information or agency computer files (i.e., deleting data).4.4.2.7 Unexplained or excessive copying of files-particularly things such as blueprints ofbuildings or systems such as security and fire suppression.4.4.2.8 Unjustified attempts to obtain or conduct specialized training in security concepts,military weapons or tactics, or other unusual capabilities such as specialized transport orhandling capabilities.4.4.2.9 Acquisition of unusual quantities of precursor material (e.g., cell phones, pagers,fuel, and timers);

Thislist is a compilation of indicators derived from multiple sources that may indicate a higher riskfor violence. If an individual demonstrates one or multiple cues, this information should be4-6AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 2012shared up the chain of command and the individual should be referred to the appropriatehelping agencies on base for further screening and evaluation by medical authorities. If theindividual is demonstrating an immediate threat of violence, contact the appropriate lawenforcement agencies. This list is not all inclusive, but provides the foundation for indicatordetection and reporting.4.4.3.1 Past conflicts (especially if violence was involved) with coworkers4.4.3.2 Tendency to blame others for problems4.4.3.3 Defensive or hostile attitude, increasing belligerence, or outbursts of anger4.4.3.4 A history of frequent job changes 4.4.3.5 Hypersensitivity to criticism4.4.3.6 Recent acquisition/fascination with weapons and/or destructive devices4.4.3.7 Apparent obsession with a supervisor or coworker or employee grievance4.4.3.8 Preoccupation with violent themes4.4.3.9 Interest in recently publicized violent events4.4.3.10 Extreme disorganization 4.4.3.11 Increased use of alcohol and/or illegal drugs 4.4.3.12 Noticeable decrease in attention to appearance and hygiene4.4.3.13 Resistance and overreaction to changes in policy and procedures4.4.3.14 Repeated violations of policies4.4.3.15 Increased severe mood swings4.4.3.16 Noticeably unstable, emotional responses4.4.3.17 Explosive outbursts of anger or rage without provocation4.4.3.18 Suicidal; comments about “putting things in order”4.4.3.19 Paranoid comments and behavior (“everybody is against me”)4.4.3.20 Increasingly talks of problems at home4.4.3.21 Escalation/introduction of domestic problems into the workplace; talk of severefinancial problems4.4.3.22 Talk of previous incidents of violence4.4.3.23 Empathy with individuals committing violence4.4.3.24 Increase in unsolicited comments about firearms, dangerous weapons, or violentcrimes4.4.3.25 Patterns of inaccurate statements or making excuses for irregular behaviorsAFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20124-74.4.3.26 Excessive tardiness or absences - beyond simply missing work, an employee mayalso reduce his or her workday by leaving early, departing the work site withoutauthorization, or presenting numerous excuses for otherwise shortening the workday4.4.3.27 Increased need for supervision; reduced productivity; inconsistent work patterns4.4.3.28 Blames others for problems in life or work; suspicious, holds grudges4.4.3.29 Unwelcome obsessive romantic attention4.4.3.30 Unshakable depression as exhibited by low energy, little enthusiasm, or despair4.4.3.31 Recently has withdrawn from normal activities, family, friends, co-workers;becomes isolated or a loner4.4.3.32 Feels wronged, humiliated, degraded; wants revenge4.4.3.33 Morally superior, self-righteous/feels entitled to special rights and that rules don'tapply to him/her4.4.3.34 Demonstrating desperation over professional or personal problems4.4.3.35 Believes to have no choices or options for action except violence4.4.3.36 A history of drug or alcohol abuse4.4.3.37 Past convictions for violent crime4.5 Dissemination. The need to develop and share information and intelligence has significantlychanged in recent years. Experience both good and bad has reinforced the premise that preventingfuture attacks depends upon our ability to gather, analyze, and share information and intelligenceregarding those who want to attack us, the tactics that they use, and the targets that they intend toattack. Whether the attacker is a trained operative from an international terrorist organization, aself-radicalized lone wolf intent on executing an attack from the inside, or a disgruntled employeecommitted to revenge, prevention is contingent on an information-sharing environment thatfacilitates the continual and rapid exchange of information.4.6 Guiding Principles for Information Sharing. Entities responsible for combating andresponding to terrorism events and/or violent activity must have access to timely and accurateinformation regarding potential threat actors. That information guides combined efforts to:4.6.1 Threats. Rapidly identify both immediate and long-term threats.4.6.2 Activities. Identify persons involved in threat-related activities.4.6.3 Implementation. Implement information-driven and risk-based detection, prevention,deterrence, response, protection, and emergency management efforts.4.7 Information Sources. Criminal and terrorism-related intelligence is best derived bycollecting, blending, analyzing, and evaluating relevant information from a broad array of sourceson a continual basis. There is no single source for threat-related information. It can come throughthe efforts of the US or HN intelligence community; various level US and HN law enforcementauthorities; US Forces; other government agencies; the private sector (contractors); and thegeneral public (US or HN civilians).4-8AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20124.7.1 Information Sharing. Historically, the focus of information sharing pertains toterrorism; however, the need for collaboration extends beyond terrorism-related issues toencompass all information relevant to force protection. Additionally, the need to shareinformation transcends operational locations; sharing information in a deployed environmentis just as critical as sharing information in the continental United States (CONUS).4.7.2 Information Packaging. Information does not typically come neatly packaged andlabeled to indicate its subject matter or domain of interest. Information from one domain mayprove valuable in another, often at a different time and in another form. Information thatinitially surfaces in the public health domain may later be determined to have implications forcounter threat operations, and vice versa.4.8 Information Sharing Foundations. The following core principles and understandings,adopted from the National Information Sharing Strategy, serve as a foundation for implementingan effective information-sharing program:4.8.1 Strong Partnerships. Effective information sharing comes through strong partnershipsamong key principals (e.g., US Forces, other government agencies, foreign partners and allies,HN, public).4.8.2 Collaboration. To maximize intelligence sharing, key principals with force protectionresponsibilities must communicate and collaborate. The objective is to leverage resources andexpertise while improving the ability to detect, prevent, and apprehend threat actors. Fosteringa collaborative environment builds trust among participating entities, strengthens partnerships,and provides individual as well as a collective ownership in the overall force protectionmission. The purpose of collaboration is to increase capacity, communication, and continuityof service while decreasing duplication. Collaboration also provides key principals access tobodies of information not normally accessible within their purview, permitting acomprehensive view of threat data.4.8.3 Information Sharing Organizations. Several recognized forums within the Air Forceexist to facilitate multifunctional collaboration and information sharing. These organizationsserve at multiple levels and include the Community Action Information Board (CAIB), theHigh Risk for Violence Response Team (HRVRT), the Threat Working Group (TWG), and theIntelligence Fusion Cell (IFC). Successful collaboration is realized when these entities worktogether to share information in a timely manner.4.9 Functional Awareness. Information acquired for one purpose, or under one set of authorities,might provide unique insights when combined, in accordance with applicable law, with topicallysimilar or even seemingly unrelated information from other sources. Successful informationsharing relationships endure because key principles remain aware of each other's requirements andchallenges, background, and worldview.4.9.1 Success. Success is contingent on fostering a culture of awareness in which keyrepresentatives at all levels of the organization remain cognizant of the functions and needs ofothers and use knowledge and information from all sources to bolster situational awareness.4.9.2 Organizations. Organizations formed for the expressed purpose of cross-functionalcollaboration greatly enhance functional awareness and information sharing; this is especiallytrue with regard to the IFC. The IFC's multifunctional composition epitomizes functionalAFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20124-9awareness, but it requires a strong understanding of the capabilities, limitations, organizationalculture, and priorities of each principal to ensure success.4.10 Information Sharing Culture. Information sharing must be woven into all aspects ofcounterterrorism activity, including preventive and protective actions, actionable responses,criminal and counterterrorism investigative activities, incident preparedness, and response to andrecovery from catastrophic incidents.4.10.1 Interconnectivity. Key force protection principals must communicate effectively. Theultimate goal is to eliminate barriers to communications and intelligence development andexchange. Communication barriers come in a number of forms (e.g., incompatible or disparatecomputer systems, lack of trust, lack of interoperability, lack of a common terminology, andlack of funding). Organizations should establish formal protocols (policies and procedures)and standards to enhance communications, as well as create effective and efficient vehicles forexchanging information. Personnel and leadership should communicate frequently and beresponsive to the needs, concerns, and ideas of both internal and external partners.4.10.2 Multidisciplinary Awareness and Education. All personnel must be equipped toidentify suspicious activities or threats and provide information to appropriate personnel.Specific training should pertain to the identification and reporting of suspicious activities orbehavioral indicators that may be indicative of potential criminal or terrorist activity.Commanders are essential to this process, due to the inherent responsibilities of command aswell as their proximity to both their Airmen and the outside agencies that can offer assistance.4.10.3 Reporting Mechanisms. Personnel must be familiar with local reporting requirementsand utilize any existing resources to exchange information. Reporting mechanisms such as 911systems, installation Eagle Eyes program, Crime Stop lines, and routine numbers for on andoff-installation law enforcement agencies may not exist in an expeditionary environment.Examples of expeditionary reporting mechanisms are: base defense operations center(BDOC), tactical operations center (TOC), and joint operations center (JOC). The SALUTE(size, activity, location, unit, time, equipment) format is a simple reporting framework thathelps ensure relevant information is reported.4.10.4 Threat Awareness Service and Products. Threat awareness and/or intelligenceproducts are the reports and delivery mechanisms that convey information to the end user.Ideally, an intelligence unit or fusion cell should establish a menu of products to meet thespecific needs of its various consumers. The products should have a consistent format andappearance to aid consumers in selecting the products most applicable to their responsibilities;however, the absence of a specific or official format should not impede the informationsharing process. These products will also balance data and analytical accuracy with reportingtimeliness.4.11 Intelligent Integration, Mutual Respect. The procedures, processes, and systems thatsupport information sharing must draw upon and integrate existing technical capabilities and mustrespect established authorities and responsibilities. This is especially true with regard to theformation of TWGs, IFCs, and other information sharing organizations.4.11.1 Information Sharing. To the greatest extent possible, agencies participating ininformation sharing endeavors should leverage existing information and intelligence sharing4-10AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 2012initiatives. Leveraging the databases and systems already available and in use via participatingentities will help maximize information sharing and eliminate redundancy.4.11.2 Memorandums of Understanding (MOU). MOUs between participating agenciesare necessary to define the terms, responsibilities, relationships, intentions, and commitmentsof each participating entity. The agreements also provide an outline of the who, what, where,when, why, and how of the organization. Partners should commit to the program policies bysigning the MOU.4.12 Outreach and Partnerships. Higher Headquarter (combatant command, major command[MAJCOM], numbered air force [NAF]) information sharing organizations and agencies representa valuable information sharing resource and should be incorporated into local information sharingframeworks. Information sharing resulting from official liaison relationships with HN intelligenceor law enforcement agencies should be established at the appropriate levels and in accordancewith guidance if they are not already in existence.4.13 Conclusion. Effective and timely information sharing combined with analysis andcontextualization of shared data provides the highest level of situational awareness available. Keyprincipals with force protection responsibilities must communicate, collaborate, and bethoroughly familiar with each other's abilities and requirements. Shared information must becombined into a usable format, balancing accuracy and timeliness, and provided to the appropriaterecipients.AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20125-1CHAPTER 5EMERGENCY ACTION PLANNING5.1 Overview. An active shooter situation is similar to many other crisis situations in thatpreparation has a direct impact on the severity and outcome of the incident. Failure to mentallyand physically prepare can lead to inaction or inappropriate actions. The same mental and physicalpreparation should be applied to an emergency action plan. In the context of force protection ormore specifically an active shooter situation, an emergency action plan (EAP) should consideradministrative practices and address the roles and responsibilities of facility managers,supervisors, and/or individuals in the work center, and workplace layout.5.2 Administrative Practices.5.2.1 Planning. To best prepare your staff for an active shooter situation, create an EAP, andconduct training exercises. Together, the EAP and training exercises will prepare members toeffectively respond and help minimize loss of life. When creating the EAP, ensure input issought from all stakeholders. An effective EAP includes evacuation policy and proceduressuch as when to attempt escape and when to confront the attacker as well as emergency escaperoutes/procedures and offices/areas that can be effectively locked down from potentialattackers. EAPs should also include contact information of emergency responders andmeasures for emergency notification within a facility (intercom and mass warning/notificationprocedures).5.2.2 Procedures. In order to produce a realistic and executable EAP, facility managers andwork center supervisors should conduct a security assessment to determine the facility'svulnerability to an active shooter attack. During this assessment, all evacuation routes shouldbe identified from each work center as well as procedures for all work center employees. Thesecurity assessment should also identify possible lockdown locations for personnel whocannot evacuate. Shelter locations should have thick walls, solid doors, minimal interiorwindows, first-aid kits, communications devices, and duress alarms. Following the securityassessment, all personnel should be trained on active shooter response procedures specific totheir work center and facility and evacuation routes should be posted in conspicuous locationsthroughout the building. Finally, the EAP should designate a point-of-contact with knowledgeof the facility's security procedures and floor plan to liaise with police and other emergencyagencies in the event of an attack. Once the EAP has been completed, active shooter drillsshould be incorporated into the organization's emergency preparedness exercises.5.2.3 Command and Control. All facilities should designate a command and controlfunction and location within the building. Whatever location is identified, it can includecommunications infrastructure, which would allow for facility-wide, real-time messagingthroughout the facility as well as external communication capable of notifying first respondersof an incident in progress.5.2.4 Entry Control. The first line of defense to detect and defend against an active shooter isto establish site specific entry control procedures. Some procedures may be more applicable towork centers that provide services such as finance offices or law enforcement desks wherethere is a clear separation between public and private (i.e., work areas) areas. In these cases,entry control procedures should be established to monitor entrances and physically control5-2AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 2012access to interior areas of the work center. In other situations, such as open work centers,procedures should be developed to limit public access to specific entrances and to entranceswhere a threat can be detected in time to sound the alarm and alert the rest of the work center.Entry control within a work center does little to prevent/deter an active shooter if accesscontrol to the facility is lacking. To establish effective access control for a facility, minimizethe number of accessible entrances to a building without limiting emergency egress. Facilitiesshould employ credential-based access control system such as coded cards, keys to controlaccess, or simple identification verification techniques (posted entry controller) on aday-to-day or random basis.5.3 Individual Responsibilities.5.3.1 Facility Manager. Facility managers play a key role in preventing or effectivelymitigating an active shooter situation. Facility managers should coordinate with allorganizations within a facility to institute access control measures (e.g., keys, security-systempass codes). Facility managers should also keep strict control of keys and alarm system passcodes to ensure they do not fall into the hands of unauthorized personnel. Facility managersare also responsible for maintaining floor plans, personnel lists and telephone numbers to beused in the event of an emergency. The facility manager should be a key point of contact(POC) for Antiterrorism and Emergency Management personnel as well as a key player inscheduling/conducting exercises within a building. Facility managers should include firstresponders as often as possible when conducting these exercises.5.3.2 Supervisors. Supervisors should keep themselves and their subordinates trained,qualified, and ready to operate during austere/emergency situations. Supervisors should ensureall subordinates are aware of emergency procedures, and their individual responsibilitiesduring emergencies. 5.3.3 Individuals. Individual members are responsible for knowing what to do during anemergency. Members are responsible for knowing escape routes, emergency procedures, andapplicable code words for different emergencies. Additionally, members should knowimportant contact information for first responders (e.g., fire department, security forces).5.4 Workplace Layout. The positioning of furniture, cubicles, appliances and other items withinthe work center impact the effectiveness of someone moving through an area engaging targets andcan reduce or enhance the ability of an active shooter to achieve target acquisition. Large openworkspaces provide a target rich environment by exposing large groups to the direct line of sightof an active shooter. Conversely, office areas where workspaces are separated by dividers orscreening can hinder a gunman's ability to engage multiple targets by restricting their ability toachieve target acquisition. In addition, this type of office design mitigates the tactical advantage ofsurprise by placing Airmen in a better position to react or escape.5.4.1 Furniture. Furniture should be used to create cover and concealment for work centerpersonnel while not limiting egress from the work center or creating safety hazards. Cover isan object that can protect against weapons fire, while concealment only provides against visualdetection from the enemy. Weapons racks should be stored in a location that is not easilyaccessible by passersby (adjacent to doors and other access points). Placing weapons racksaway from access points gives personnel within the room or building a chance to identify andmonitor the person(s) entering the workspace, which may result in detecting hostile intentAFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20125-3before it begins. It would be most advantageous for workers to store weapons at/or near theirdesks or in the case of side arms, on their person. This would prevent hostile personnel fromusing those weapons against US military personnel and would give them an effective means ofdefending themselves. 5.4.2 Observation. Ideally, furniture within the workspace should be arranged to prevent allpersonnel within a work center from being visible upon entering a room or area. Wide-openwork centers provide a shooter an unhindered line-of-sight to all personnel while limitingcover, concealment, and hidden escape routes for possible targets. Workplace managers shouldposition the furniture in the room or workplace to conceal workers from entry points. The useof cubicles for individual work centers is particularly effective for this purpose. Additionally,workers should be spread out through an area to provide them increased distance from hostilepersonnel. Finally, work center managers should position personnel to face toward entrypoints, rather than away from them in order to increase detection and assessment of hostileactors.5.4.3 Separation of Public and Private Areas. Separation of public and private areas canprovide a certain level of detection as it helps workers identify who should be in a work centerand who should not. Separate public/service areas from the rest of the work center through theuse of pass-through windows, bulletproof glass, counters, etc. Waiting rooms and cipher lockdoors also provide a certain amount of protection as it clearly delineates where the public isallowed access to versus work centers that are limited to certain personnel. 5.4.4 Accessibility. The use of cipher lock doors, identification badges, and screeningmeasures creates an additional layer of security for work centers by helping identify who isauthorized in a work center and who is not. The use of cipher locks not only limits the entry ofunauthorized personnel into a work center, it also provides an additional barrier to hostilepersonnel and enhances lockdown capability in the event a work center has only oneentrance/exit.5.4.5 Egress. All potential avenues of egress should be left clear in the event an active shooteror other emergency situation (e.g., fire, hazardous materials emergency) arises. All furnitureand other items should be kept clear of emergency exits in order to prevent members frombeing cornered in their offices. Inspection testing and maintenance (ITM) should be conductedon all emergency exit lights in accordance with published directives to ensure all work centeremployees can easily identify an escape route. Finally, evacuation routes should be posted inevery work center and be exercised as often as practical.5-4AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 2012THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANKAFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20126-1INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS: ESCAPE, BARRICADE, OR FIGHTCHAPTER 66.1 Active Shooter Considerations. Active shooter situations are unpredictable and evolvequickly. Because active shooter situations are often over before first responders arrive on sceneindividual action is the key to survival. It is critical all Airmen are mentally, physically, andpsychologically prepared to effectively react to the active shooter threat. To do this, Airmen mustbe prepared to employ their weapons if armed or seek other means of self-defense if unarmed. AllAirmen must know and understand the rules of engagement to include understanding the inherentright to self-defense and the defense of others. To enhance an Airman’s capability to meet thesechallenges, leaders should conduct frequent battle drills to reinforce skills and develop musclememory to execute the individual responses outlined in this chapter and throughout this AFTTP. 6.2 Escape, Barricade, or Fight. During an active shooter situation, you have three options:escape, barricade, or fight. These choices are not in any particular order and there are norequirements to progress through one option before selecting another. Each option selected shouldbe done because it provides you the greatest chance of survival. The decision whether to escape,barricade, or fight must be based on two factors: (1) your proximity to the shooter and (2) theaccessibility of egress routes. Although not a hard and fast rule, the information below provides ageneral synopsis of factors to consider when selecting to escape, barricade, or fight.6.2.1 Escape. Escape is a viable option if you are not directly confronted with the shooter(s),your egress route is unobstructed, or your egress route is not under the observation of theshooter(s). The following considerations can enhance your chances of survival whileemploying escape:6.2.1.1 Consider all points of egress as potential escape routes (e.g., windows, doors).6.2.1.2 Pre-identify multiple workstation escape routes.6.2.1.3 Escape regardless of whether or not others agree to follow.6.2.1.4 Be aware of other possible threats.6.2.1.5 Be prepared to “fight” and if not armed carry an improvised weapon (e.g., scissors,something to strike someone with, or something to throw).6.2.1.6 Do not waste time gathering belongings (e.g., jacket, backpack). The onlyexception to this is YOUR WEAPON.6.2.1.7 Notify others to escape.6.2.1.8 If armed, do not pursue the threat with the exception of security forces who arearmed and will move toward the threat.6.2.1.9 Use individual tactics to move tactically through doorways and windows, aroundcorners and through hallways to minimize exposure.6.2.1.10 If armed, cover the general location of the shooter(s) with your weapon. With around in the chamber, place the weapon on fire keeping the weapon in the ready positionto avoid fatal delays in target engagement if you have to transition to fight.6-2AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20126.2.1.11 Weigh the removal of wounded with the probability of escape (This should befurther addressed in local policy).6.2.1.12 If evacuating wounded, do not treat the wounded in the danger area. Only treatwounded at a safe location once free of the threat.6.2.1.13 Do not hinder escape by recovering the dead.6.2.1.14 Continually identify locations to fall back and barricade if your escape route iscompromised.6.2.1.15 Avoid fratricide. It is extremely important to identify the target as hostile beforeusing deadly force. Remember you may come in contact with non-hostile armedindividuals such as first responders and other armed escapees (in a deployed environment)who are executing the same escape tactics as you. Practicing simulation drills and shootdon't shoot scenarios ahead of time will help avoid fratricide and condition Airmen toengage hostile targets.6.2.1.16 Proceed to a safe location. Move away from the vicinity of the shooter(s) to anarea providing protection from hostile fire and observation (could be another facility).NOTE: The use of previously identified rally points can pose an additional danger to personnelbecause the active shooter(s) could be an insider threat and may exploit prior knowledge of theselocations to obtain a target rich environment (e.g., additional shooters, pre-placed explosives).6.2.1.17 Once in a safe area, notify first responders via any means available to you (e.g.,landline, radio, runner). When notifying first responders, provide the followinginformation:6.2.1.17.1 Location of the active shooter(s).6.2.1.17.2 Number of shooters, if more than one.6.2.1.17.3 Physical description of shooter(s).6.2.1.17.4 Number and type of weapons held by the shooter(s).6.2.1.17.5 Number of potential victims at the location.6.2.2 Barricade. Barricading is not merely hiding. It is the active effort to hinder the shooter'sability to enter the room or facility. Barricade is a viable option if: (1) it is likely you are notdirectly confronted with the shooter(s); or (2) it is likely your egress route is obstructed and/orunder the observation of the shooter(s). If barricade is employed, the senior ranking personwill take command of the “sector.” The following are considerations to enhance survival whileemploying barricade:6.2.2.1 Close and lock door(s).6.2.2.2 Be prepared to fight. If not armed, secure an improvised weapon.6.2.2.3 If armed, cover the point of entry into your area with your weapon while othersbuild the barricade.AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20126-36.2.2.3.1 With a round in the chamber, place weapon on fire and keep it pointed atpoint of entry. You should take up a position, which provides you cover and protectsyou from weapons fire.6.2.2.4 Move heavy objects to barricade the door.6.2.2.5 If barricading the door with objects in the room is not possible, use objects in theroom as obstacles to slow down, fix, turn, or obscure the vision of the shooter. Even thoughan obstacle will not prevent a shooter from entering your area (i.e., sector), it will help youachieve a tactical advantage to “Defend Your Sector.”6.2.2.5.1 The phrase “Defend Your Sector” simply implies the actions taken duringthe fight to protect yourself and others in the area where you have barricaded.6.2.2.6 Turn off the lights.6.2.2.7 Remain quiet and observe noise discipline (e.g., limit movement, talking,whispering, and yelling).6.2.2.7.1 Silence your cell phone and/or pager.6.2.2.7.2 Turn off any source of noise (e.g., radios, televisions).6.2.2.8 Develop a strategy to “Defend Your Sector” using fight in case you cannot preventthe threat from entering the room.6.2.2.9 Hide in a place that reduces observation from the shooter, but allows you to reactif you must defend your sector.6.2.2.9.1 These positions should provide cover and/or concealment. Cover is an objectwhich protects you from weapons fire. Concealment protects you from enemyobservation. If you are armed, choose a position that provides you cover so you caneffectively engage the shooter(s) with your weapon while being protected fromweapons fire.6.2.2.10 Once, first responders make contact with you, communicate with response forcesas necessary.6.2.2.11 If your barriers are breached, you must “Defend Your Sector.”6.2.3 Fight. Hopefully by now leaders have effectively leveraged the recommendationsoutlined in this AFTTP to properly condition their Airmen to react to a hostile threat. Toclarify, fight is not a last option. As with each tactic previously discussed, fight is employedwhen it offers you the best chance for survival. Fight may be your first and only option. Youwould choose to fight if: (1) you are directly confronted with the shooter(s) or (2) theshooter(s) breaches your barricade and you need to defend your sector. In this situation, escapeand barricade (or the hide portion of barricade) may actually decrease your chances ofsurvival. In short, if you are directly engaged with a hostile force or engagement is imminent;your best chance for survival is to counter the threat with fight. As already stated, even if youselect escape and barricade you must always be prepared to transition to fight if the tacticalsituation changes. It is important to note, pursuit of an active shooter(s) is discouraged with theexception being armed security forces. However, violent and fierce fight for survival isadvocated when the tactical situation dictates. Your ability to fight will greatly be affected by6-4AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 2012your weapon status (i.e., armed or unarmed) and your ability to engage with surprise, speed,and violence of action. The following are considerations that enhance your chances of survivalwhen employing fight:6.2.3.1 (Unarmed) Secure an improvised weapon (e.g., something to strike or throw).6.2.3.2 (Unarmed) Throw objects aiming at the individual’s head (surprise); followed byan immediate (speed) committed counter attack (violence of action).6.2.3.3 (Unarmed) Attempt to disarm or direct the weapons away from you and others.6.2.3.4 (Unarmed) Commit to the fight. There is no move that is “off limits.” Usewhatever is necessary to survive and incapacitate the shooter(s). Hit the shooter with anobject or fist, eye gouge, bite, groin strike, pull hair, stomp on feet, head butt, punchindividual in the throat (violence of action). Whatever it takes, become more violent thanthe shooter and do not stop until the threat is subdued or terminated.6.2.3.5 (Unarmed) Focus attacks on weak points in the shooter’s defense: eyes, nose,groin, throat (violence of action). Hit hard, hit fast, and hit often.6.2.3.6 (Unarmed) Seize the initiative. If you are directly in the vicinity of the shooter(s)and your fellow Airman attacks, join the fight and overwhelm the shooter(s). Do not stopyour attack until the shooter has been rendered incapable of continuing their act ofviolence. Evident by the actions of United Airlines Flight 93 a small number of unarmedindividuals can overrun an armed individual in a singular united effort if they exploitsurprise, speed, and violence of action.6.2.3.7 (Armed) If you are engaged, immediately return fire while moving to cover(protection from weapons fire).6.2.3.8 (Armed) If you are not immediately engaged but the shooter(s) is approachingyour area (example breaching your barricade or following you on your escape route), seekand take cover (protection from weapons fire). If cover is not available, seek and take aposition of concealment (concealed from shooter’s observation). Seize the tacticaladvantage through surprise, speed, and violence action and engage the threat.6.2.3.9 (Armed) Suppress, neutralize, and/or destroy target(s) while minimizing threat tofriendly forces and limiting collateral damage to civilians. Do not pursue the threat(Exception: armed security forces). Armed personnel should cover the escape of othersand attempt to evacuate.6.2.3.10 (Armed) Avoid fratricide. It is extremely important to identify the target ashostile before using deadly force. Remember you may encounter non-hostile armedindividuals such as responding forces and other escapees (in a deployed environment),who are executing the same escape tactics as you.6.2.3.11 If the shooter(s) is subdued, secure the weapon. Be aware there may be moreshooters and only responding forces can declare a scene safe. If the immediate threat hasbeen terminated, reevaluate escape, barricade, and fight based on the presence of anothershooter. If there are no other known shooters, cover the threat (armed) or physicallyrestrain the threat (unarmed), maintain visual of the threat, wait for first responders, andevacuate all personnel not detaining the shooter (leave an over-watch).AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20126-56.2.3.12 Fight through pain or injury. It is also important to understand you can fight evenwhen injured.  Boxers finish fights with broken hands and win. Leaders can condition theirAirmen to fight though pain by implementing combatives training as part of a physicaltraining program and having Airmen fight beyond initial onset of exhaustion in acontrolled environment.6.3 What to Expect When First Responders Arrive on the Scene. Although not universallytrue for all responding elements, most United States (US) first responders generally utilize thefollowing common procedures and it is important to know what to expect. The following is a basicsynopsis of actions to expect from first responders:• May arrive in small teams.• May proceed directly to the area where the last shots were heard.• May wear a variety of uniforms (e.g., local law enforcement, host nation). and tacticalequipment (e.g., bulletproof vests, helmets).• May be armed with rifles, shotguns, and/or pistols.• May use pepper spray, tear gas, or flash bangs to control the situation.• May shout commands and push individuals to the ground for their safety.• Most likely will not stop to help injured personnel.• Expect rescue teams comprised of additional first responders and emergency medicalpersonnel to follow the initial responders. These rescue teams will treat and remove anyinjured persons.• May instruct able-bodied individuals to assist in providing self-aid buddy care and removingthe wounded.6.4 How to React When First Responders Arrive. Individual actions do not end immediatelyafter the threat is neutralized. Every individual must strictly adhere to local procedures regardingindividual actions once first responders are on scene. These procedures are established for yoursafety and the safety of the first responders. In the absence of local procedures, the followingindividual actions apply:• First responders are only subject to the orders of their operational and tactical commandduring a response. Individuals not formally assigned or attached in operational or tacticalcontrol (OPCON or TACON) of first responders should not give orders to first respondersregardless of rank, position, or affiliation. Violating this procedure hinders the tacticaleffectiveness of first responders, may result in an increased risk to personnel still in harm'sway, and may constitute a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). • Upon contact with first responders, remain calm, empty your hands, spread your fingers, andraise your hands keeping them visible. Follow the instructions of any first responders.• Avoid making quick movements toward first responders such as reaching for something orholding onto first responders for safety. • Do not stop to ask first responders for help or directions when evacuating.• Proceed in the direction from which first responders are entering the premises.• Provide first responders with the following information:6-6AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20121. Location of the active shooter(s).2. Number of shooters, if more than one.3. Physical description of shooter(s).4. Number and type of weapons held by the shooter(s).5. Number of potential victims at the location.• If you have escaped to a safe location or an assembly point, you will likely be held in thatarea by first responders until the situation is under control and all witnesses have beenidentified and questioned. Be patient, cooperate fully, and do not leave until first respondersinstruct you to do so.AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 20127-1CHAPTER 7TRAINING BEFORE DEPLOYMENT7.1 Program Design. In order to prepare Airmen for the active shooter threat they may facewhile deployed, the US Air Force provides active shooter training within its Tiered-trainingconstruct. This training is designed to meet the physical, intellectual, and psychological elementsnecessary to develop a foundation for conditioning Airmen to react and survive in the event of anactive shooter. The active shooter training program spans CBT to force-on-force simulationtraining.7.2 Air Force Mandated Training. All Airmen will complete active shooter training duringtheir review of the Antiterrorism Level I CBT included in the Total Force Awareness Training(TFAT).7.3 Airmen Tasked to Deploy. Airmen with air expeditionary force deployment orders shouldreceive active shooter training prior to deployment. This training provides Airmen an intellectualunderstanding of threat indicators, how to develop a warrior mindset, environmental factorsaffecting survival during an active shooter attack, reacting to an active shooter, actions to takeupon escape from an active shooter scene and actions to take when first responders arriveon-scene. In addition to the intellectual training, all Airmen tasked to deploy should completepractical application providing a physical training event to aid proper conditioning.7.4 Airmen in Tier 3, Advanced Expeditionary Skills Training. Airmen attending CombatAirmen Skills, Air Advisor, Joint Expeditionary Tasking (JET), and any other Tier 3 certifiedtraining should receive hands-on training building upon previously learned skills that continue tocondition Airmen to react to an active shooter situation while armed or unarmed.7.5 Training Prior to Deployment. The training identified in this AFTTP is designed to provideadditional training opportunities to prepare Airmen for the threats they may face. This training isnot a substitute for recurring commander or leader led training. Table 7.1, Additional Training,offers additional training resources for Air Force leaders.7-2AFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 2012Table 7.1 Additional Training The following training modules can be found at the AF Security Forces “SMARTNet” web site:https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/sfot-eTTPGs.htmlAmbush TacticsChallenge Individuals    (includes video) Combat Stress Recovery Contact and Approach Techniques Employ Physical Apprehension and Restraint Techniques   (includes video) Mental Preparation for Combat Practice Enforce Weapons Safety- M9   (includes video) Practice Enforce Weapons Safety - M4/M16   (includes video) React to Weapons Fire Reaction Drills Rifle Fighting Techniques    (includes video) Rules of Engagement SALUTE  Report Terrorism & Antiterrorism Module 1Terrorism & Antiterrorism Module 2Use of ForceWeapons Retention & Disarming   (includes video)UNCLASSIFIEDAFTTP 3-4.6 14 Nov 2012A1-1ATTACHMENT 1GLOSSARY OF REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATIONA1.1 References.Air Force Publications1.
