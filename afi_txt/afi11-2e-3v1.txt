Be responsible for completion of training requirements and currencies within the guidelines of this volume and applicable RAP tasking message. (T-3) 1.3.9.3.  Not  participate  in  flying  activities  for  which  they  are  not  trained,  qualified,  or current unless under appropriate supervision. (T-1) 1.4.  Training.  Aircrew  training  is  designed  to  progress  aircrew  from  Initial  Qualification Training (IQT) (Basic Course or Re-Qualification) to Mission Qualification Training (MQT), to Continuation  Training  (CT),  and  eventually  to  a  higher  qualification  (instructor/evaluator), Qualification Training (QT) in a new crew position, or specialized training. 1.4.1.  IQT/QT provide the training needed to qualify for basic aircrew duties in an assigned crew  position,  without  regard  to  the  unit’s  operational  mission.  See  Chapter  2.  Upon completion  of  IQT  or  QT  in  a  new  crew  position,  aircrew  members  attain  Basic  Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 9 1.4.1.1.  BAQ  aircrew  have  completed  a  flight  evaluation  and  are  qualified  to  perform basic  aircrew  duties  in  the  E-3.  Squadron  CCs/DOs  carefully  choose  those  missions  on which BAQ aircrew may fly unsupervised. BAQ aircrew will only perform those duties for which they have been trained and qualified. (T-1) With instructor supervision, BAQ aircrew may participate in composite force or other advanced scenarios. 1.4.1.2.  BAQ is a prerequisite for MQT. 1.4.1.3.  Except  for  General  Officers,  BAQ  is  not  a  long-term  qualification  status  and waiver authority to remain BAQ resides with MAJCOM/A3. 1.4.2.  MQT  provides  aircrew  the  advanced  training  necessary  to  qualify  to  perform  the command  or  unit  mission.  See  Chapter  3.  Aircrew  members  that  have  not  previously completed MQT for their assigned crew position will maintain BAQ status until completion of MQT. (T-1) Completion of MQT is a prerequisite for CMR/BMC. See Chapter 4. 1.4.3.  CT  provides  aircrew  with  the  volume,  frequency,  and  mix  of  training  necessary  to maintain proficiency in the assigned qualification level. RAP is the CT program designed to focus training toward needed skills. Specific RAP instructions are issued by each MAJCOM via a RAP tasking message. See Chapter 4. 1.4.4.  Aircrew  will  have  received  training  in  all  basic  missions  of  a  specific  unit  upon completion of IQT and MQT. (T-1) Aircrew will then be designated either CMR or BMC.(T-1) 1.4.4.1.  CMR.  CMR  aircrew  will  maintain  proficiency  and  qualification  in  all  core missions  of  the  flying  unit  to  which  they  are  assigned  or  attached.  (T-1)  CMR  aircrew will maintain currencies which affect CMR status, accomplish all core designated flight training  (sorties  and  events),  and  all  mission  ground  training.  Failure  to  complete  this training or maintain these currencies results in regression to Non-CMR (N-CMR) status. These  currencies  and  events  are  outlined  in  Chapter  4  and  applicable  RAP  Tasking memorandum. (T-1) 1.4.4.2.  BMC.  BMC  designated  aircrew  members  have  a  primary  job  performing  wing supervision or staff functions that directly support the flying mission. These aircrew are required to provide additional sortie generation capability, either in lieu of or in addition to, the personnel assigned to the flying squadrons. (T-1) See Chapter 4. 1.4.4.2.1.  BMC  aircrew  will  maintain  familiarization  with  all  unit  core  missions. They  may  also  maintain  proficiency  and  qualification  in  some  of  the  unit  core missions. (T-1) BMC aircrew must be able to attain CMR qualification in 30 days or less. (T-1) 1.4.4.2.2.  BMC  aircrew  will  accomplish  all  mission-related  ground training designated  by  their  attached  SQ/CC.  (T-3)  BMC  aircrew  may  deploy  and  may participate  in  any  mission  for  which  they  are  proficient  and  qualified,  without additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC. 1.4.4.2.3.  Failure  to  complete  BMC  required  training  results  in  regression  to  Non-BMC  (N-BMC)  status.  While  N-BMC,  aircrew  will  not  perform  in-flight  aircrew duties without supervision IAW with paragraph 1.6.4 and 4.8 until re-certified. (T-1) 10 AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 1.4.4.3.  API-6/8/C/D  rated  personnel  flying  authorizations,  Career  Enlisted  Aviator (CEA)  flying  authorizations,  NAF-assigned  aircrew,  nonrated  MAJCOM  Realistic Training Program aircrew, USAFWS assigned instructors, and test aircrew are managed IAW AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training, and MAJCOM guidance. 1.4.4.3.1.  These aircrew members require a valid AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification,  IAW  AFI  11-202V2,  Aircrew  Standardization/Evaluation  Program, and AFI 11-2E3V2, E-3 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria. 1.4.4.3.2.  These aircrew members fly the BMC rate; however, they are not required to complete BMC-specific ATD events. EXCEPTION: Wing-assigned members who are BMC will accomplish associated ATD/ground training events. 1.4.4.3.3.  If  these  aircrew  members  are  current,  they  may  fly  without  an  instructor with SQ/CC or DO concurrence. 1.4.4.3.4.  These  aircrew  members  are  exempt  from  academic  ground  training, chemical warfare (CW) training, and special training programs (except when required in  preparation  for  theater  deployment).  These  personnel  must  complete  ground training events identified as mandatory grounding items, Table 4.1. IAW paragraph 4.10. (T-1) These aircrew will also complete SS02 and SS05 training. (T-1) 1.4.4.4.  Unqualified  (UQ).  Unqualified  aircrew  members  require  a  flight  evaluation before progressing to a higher qualification level. UQ aircrew members fall under one or more of the following categories: 1.4.4.4.1.  Enrolled in QT. 1.4.4.4.1.1.  Qualified  and  CMR  aircrew  in  QT  for  a  new  crew  position  will  not be  made  UQ  or  NCMR  in  their  presently  qualified  crew  position  for  the  sole reason that they are in  training for a new position.  Example:  If an AWO enters SD  QT  and  is  qualified  and  CMR  as  an  AWO,  this  person  will  maintain  CMR AWO  status  until  1)  completion  of  SD  QT,  2)  they  become  NCMR  or  UQ  for reasons  outlined  in  AFI  11-202v1,  3)  they  fail  RAP  lookback,  or  4)  their  AWO checkride expires. 1.4.4.4.2.  Downgraded  for  being  Non-Current  per  Table  4.7  or  Table  4.8  as applicable. 1.4.4.4.3.  Downgraded for a demonstrated lack of ability. 1.4.4.4.4.  Downgraded for failure to meet standards during a QUAL flight evaluation or  at  SQ/CC  discretion  following  a  Commander-directed  downgrade  IAW  AFI  11-202V2. 1.4.4.5.  Returning  personnel  currently  qualified  in  a  non-USAF  E-3  aircraft  require difference training.  See paragraph 5.5. 1.4.4.6.  Aircrew  Experience  Level.  Aircrew  Experience  Levels  tell  unit  commanders how much flying and Aircrew Training Device (ATD) training CMR and BMC aircrew members  need  to  maintain  RAP  requirements.  There  are  two  Experience  Levels  for aircrew  members  who receive  CMR/BMC  qualification:  "Inexperienced"  and "Experienced." AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 11 training  cycle 1.4.4.6.1.  Assigning  Experience/Inexperience  Levels.  Aircrew requirements  are  based  on the  aircrew  member’s  current  "experienced"  or "inexperienced" status. When an aircrew member changes experience levels, training requirements are prorated from the date of experience certification. 1.4.4.7.  Experience  Level  Progression.  SQ/CCs  may  reclassify  CMR/BMC  aircrew members  as  "experienced"  based  on  successfully  completing  a  unit-developed experienced  certification  program  and  the  progression  guidelines  in  paragraph  1.5.4.8. SQ/CCs  may  waive  the  experience  certification  program  and  progression  guidelines based  on  demonstrated  proficiency.  Squadron  DOT  documents  reclassification  as "Combat Mission Ready/Experienced or Basic Mission Capable/Experienced" in Section II of the aircrew member’s training record. 1.4.4.8.  Recommended Progression Guidelines for Combat Mission Ready Experienced (CMR/E). 1.4.4.8.1.  Aircraft Commanders (AC) have 200 hours as a CMR/BMC E-3 AC. 1.4.4.8.2.

Upgrade/Specialized Training. Upgrade/Specialized training is training in any special skills necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned mission that is not required by every aircrew. See  Chapter  5.  Upgrade/Specialized  training  is  normally  accomplished  after  an  aircrew  is assigned CMR/BMC status and is normally in addition to CMR/BMC requirements. Unless otherwise special capabilities/qualifications  as  long  as  applicable  additional  training  requirements  are accomplished. aircrew  members  may hold specified, CMR/BMC 1.4.5.1.  Instructor  Qualified/Evaluator  Certified.  Instructor  qualified/evaluator  certified aircrew  members  are  trained  and  qualified/certified  to  instruct  and/or  evaluate  duties associated  with  their  aircrew  positions.  Instructor  qualified/evaluator  certified  aircrew members  will  maintain  CMR/BMC  status.  (T-1)  Instructors  may  perform  instructor duties  in-flight  as  long  as  they  are  CMR/BMC  and  current  in  the  event  they  are instructing.  Instructors  who  become  N-CMR/N-BMC  may  be  allowed  to  continue academic and/or ATD instructor duties with 552 OG/CC, 513 ACG/CC, 3 OG/CC, or 18 OG/CC or equivalent approval. 1.5.  Training Concepts and Policies: 1.5.1.  Training  programs  are  designed  to  achieve  the  highest  degree  of  combat  readiness consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training balances the need for realism against  the  expected  threat,  aircrew  capabilities,  and  safety.  This  volume  provides  training guidelines  and  policies  to  be  used  with  operational  procedures  specified  in  applicable flying/operations  publications.    MAJCOM  RAP  Tasking  Memorandum  (RTM)  may  not  be less restrictive or deviate from training concepts outlined in this instruction. 1.5.2.  HQ  ACC  Training  Support  Squadron  (TRSS)  will  develop  and  validate  training programs when/where tasked. (T-1) 1.5.3.  Training missions are designed to achieve combat capability in squadron tasked roles, maintain  proficiency,  and  enhance  mission  accomplishment  and  safety.  RAP  training missions should emphasize either basic combat skills, or scenarios that reflect procedures and operations  based  on  employment  plans,  location,  current  intelligence,  and  opposition capabilities. Use procedures and actions applicable to combat scenarios (i.e. appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures, combat  tactics, safe  recovery procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, intel briefing and debriefing). 1.5.4.  In-Flight Supervision: 1.5.4.1.  The  following  personnel  must  be  under  the  direct  supervision  of  an instructor/evaluator when performing aircrew duties. (T-1) 1.5.4.1.1.  Unqualified aircrew members. 1.5.4.1.2.  Aircrew  members  performing  events  in  which  they  are  noncurrent  or unqualified.  Note:  With  SQ/CC  or  DO  approval,  the  following  operations  are permitted:  Pilots  may  fly  unsupervised  while  non-current  for  night  landing  and/or night  air refueling on sorties planned not  to  include night  operations. Pilots  may fly unsupervised  when  non-current  for  auto-pilot  off  air  refueling  when  AAR  is  not AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 13 planned.  IPs  may  fly  unsupervised  while  non-current  for-touch  and-go  landings  and air  refueling  on  sorties  planned  not  to  include  this  event.  SD/AWOs  may  fly unsupervised while non-current for controlled mission when they are not scheduled as a primary controller. 1.5.4.1.3.  Any senior officer who has not completed IQT requirements of Chapter 2 including an appropriate flight evaluation. 1.5.4.1.4.  Aircrew  member  downgraded  to  N-CMR/N-BMC.  Note:  With  SQ/CC  or DO  approval  N-CMR/N-BMC  aircrew  member  may  fly  unsupervised  if  N-CMR/N-BMC for ground training events unrelated to flight operations. 1.6.  Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Policy and Management: 1.6.1.  AWACS  units  are  scheduled  to  Air  Expeditionary  Force  (AEF)  pairs  however;  their Low  Supply/High  Demand  status  drives  one  common  12-month  RAP  cycle  for  all  units. Each RAP qualification level is defined by a total number of RAP sorties, broken down into mission  types,  plus  specific  qualifications  and  associated  events  as  determined  by  the MAJCOM and unit commanders. 1.6.2.  The total number of CMR and BMC RAP sorties accomplished is the primary factor for maintaining an individual’s qualification level. A review of the RAP sorties flown should also  consider  specific  sortie  and  mission  types.  Variations  may  be  used  as  a  basis  for regression by the SQ/CC. Qualification in a mission is determined by the SQ/CC considering the MAJCOM guidance and the individual’s capabilities. 1.6.3.  The SQ/CC’s first priority should be to train all designated aircrew to CMR. 1.6.4.  Progression from BMC to CMR requires: 1.6.4.1.  A 1-month lookback at CMR sortie rate. 1.6.4.2.  Qualification  in  all  missions  and  any  specialized  mission  training  required  for CMR. 1.6.4.3.  Completion of mission-related ground training. 1.6.4.4.  Squadron CC certification. 1.6.5.  CMR  aircrew  members  should  fly  the  required  monthly  sortie  rate  to  achieve lookback.  See Table 4.5.  Requirements for lookback are described in paragraph 4.8.2. 1.7.  Training Program Development: 1.7.1.  RAP  Tasking  memorandum  sortie  and  event  requirements  apply  to  CMR  and  BMC aircrew  as  well  as  those  carrying  special  capabilities  or  qualifications.  The  current  RAP Tasking  memorandum  may  contain  updated  requirements,  sorties,  missions,  definitions,  or events  not  yet  incorporated into this volume. The standard sortie requirements  establish the minimum number of sorties per training cycle for each of the following levels of training: 1.7.1.1.  BMC.  The  minimum  training  required  for  aircrew  to  be  familiar  with  all,  and may be qualified and proficient in some, of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapons system. 14 AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 1.7.1.2.  CMR. The minimum training required for aircrew to be qualified and proficient in all of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapons system. 1.7.2.  Collateral  or  Cost  of  Business  sortie  requirements  are  considered  when  developing unit  flying  hour  programs.  These  sorties  are  not  directly  related  to  combat  employment training  but  are  necessary  in  day-to-day  unit  operations.  These  sorties  or  requirements include, but are not limited to, ferry flights, incentive flights, deployments, and air shows. 1.7.3.  Unit flying hour programs are allocated a number of attrition sorties that compensate for  non-effective  training  sorties.  Non-effective  sorties  are  logged  when  a  training  sortie, RAP or non-RAP, is planned, but a major portion of valid training for that type of mission is not accomplished due to poor weather, air aborts, etc. It is essential that non-effective sorties are logged appropriately for HHQ to accurately allocate the number of attrition sorties each year. 1.8.  Training  Records  and  Reports.  Units  will  maintain  aircrew  records  for  individual training  and  evaluations  IAW  AFI  11-202V1,  AFI  11-202V2,  AFI  11-401,  AFI  33-360,  and appropriate MAJCOM directives. (T-0) 1.8.1.  Units will document and maintain aircrew certification/upgrade training in individual training  folders  IAW  AFI  11-202V1  using  AF  Form  4324,  Aircraft  Assignment/Aircrew Qualification Worksheet, and the 552 OG Form 52, Aircrew Certification, or PACAF/AFRC unit equivalents. 1.8.2.  Units will prepare and forward training reports IAW MAJCOM directives and current RAP Tasking memorandum. (T-1) 1.8.3.  Units using ARMS will maintain flying and ground training records IAW AFI 11-401 and  MAJCOM  supplements.  When  documenting  aircrew  training  in  ARMS,  use  AF  Form 1522,  ARMS  Additional  Training  Accomplishment  Input,  or  a  locally  developed  Mission to  AFI  11-421,  Aviation  Resource Accomplishment  Report  (MAR) Management, and AFI 33-360 for guidance. that  adheres 1.8.4.  Track the following information for all aircrew (as applicable): 1.8.4.1.  Ground training. 1.8.4.2.  Requirements  and  accomplishment  of  individual  sorties,  RAP  sorties,  sortie types, and events cumulatively for the training cycle. 1.8.4.3.  RAP  sortie  requirements  and  accomplishment  using  1-month  and  3-month running totals for look-back. 1.8.4.4.  Currencies. 1.9.  Aircrew Utilization Policy: 1.9.1.  Commanders  will  ensure  aircrew  fill  authorized  positions  IAW  unit  manning documents  and  aircrew  status  is  properly  designated.  The  overall  objective  is  that  aircrews perform combat-related duties. (T-1) 1.9.2.  Supervisors may assign aircrew to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, FEB/mishap board  member,  etc.),  but  should  continually  weigh  the  factors  involved,  such  as  level  of aircrew tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience. AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 15 1.9.3.  For inexperienced aircrew, supervisors will limit the non-flying duties to those related to combat training activities. (T-1) 1.9.4.  Training  while  DNIF.  DNIF  crewmembers  will  complete  ground  training  events, including simulator training, if the member’s physical condition allows. RAP events that are creditable  in  an  Aircrew  Training  Device  (ATD)  may  be  logged  when  performing  those events  while  individuals  are  DNIF.  Consult  the  Flight  Surgeon  initiating  DD  Form  2992 action as prescribed by AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards, if the DNIF status includes ground training limitations. 1.10.  Sortie Allocation Guidance: 1.10.1.  Inexperienced  aircrew  members  should  receive  sortie  allocation  priority  over experienced aircrew members. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows: 1.10.1.1.  Formal Training Units. Formal syllabus training, Instructor Upgrade, Instructor CT, authorized staff personnel not performing Instructor or Flight Examiner duties. 1.10.1.2.  Operational Units. CMR, MQT, then BMC. 1.10.1.3.  API-6/8/C/D  aircrew,  USAFWS  assigned  instructors,  non-rated  MAJCOM Realistic  Training  program  aircrew,  NAF-assigned  aircrew,  test  aircrew,  and  API-5 aircrew physicians. 1.10.1.4.  Consideration  should  also  be  given  to  requirements  directed  by  MAJCOM, training required to prepare for assigned projects/tasking, and BMC training requirements that cannot be accomplished on primary missions IAW this volume. 16 AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 Chapter 2 QUALIFICATION TRAINING 2.1.  General.  This  chapter  outlines  Initial  Qualification  Training  (IQT)  of  aircrew  into  unit aircraft  and  Qualification  Training  (QT)  into  a  new  crew  position  on  the  aircraft.  IQT/QT normally  will  be  conducted  during  formal  syllabus  courses  at  formal  training  unit  (FTU) squadron whenever possible.  In exceptional circumstances, when FTU training is not available within a reasonable time period, QT may be conducted at the local unit IAW provisions of this chapter.  This  in-unit  QT  will  be  conducted  using  appropriate  formal  FTU  syllabus,  flow programs  and  requirements.    When  in-unit  QT  is  authorized,  the  gaining  MAJCOM  assumes responsibility for the burden of providing this training locally. 2.1.1.  Any  aircrew  member  who  has  been  unqualified  longer  than  96  months  must accomplish  QT  through  the  FTU.  All  E-3  crew  positions  are  required  to  meet  QT  syllabus standards.

This  chapter  outlines  ground  and  flight  requirements  for  CT  to  maintain  E-3 qualification, currency, and to requalify previously qualified aircrew members in the E-3. 4.2.  Training Period.  CT is tracked on the Fiscal Year (1 Oct – 30 Sep). Every attempt should be  made  to  balance  training  across  the  entire  training  cycle,  however,  unit  commanders  shall strive to exceed RAP Tasking Message (RTM) minimums. 4.3.  Prerequisites.  Aircrew members will have CMR/BMC certification. (T-1) 4.4.  Waivers/Special  Categories.  552  OG/CC,  513  ACG/CC,  3  OG/CC,  and  18  OG/CC  may adjust the requirements in this chapter, unless specifically noted otherwise. Waiver authority for ground training is IAW the reference directive. (T-2) 4.4.1.  Squadron CCs forward, to the appropriate waiver authority, a list of aircrew members requiring  a  waiver  and  aircrew  members  downgraded  for  failure  to  meet  lookback requirements IAW Attachment 4. 4.4.2.  Waiver  requests  must  be  received  by  552  OG/CC,  18  OG/CC,  3  OG/CC,  or  513 ACG/CC no later than 15 days after the end of their RAP training cycle. (T-1) 4.4.3.  After  final  review  and  determination  of  waiver  requests,  552  OG/CC,  18  OG/CC,  3 OG/CC  or  513  ACG/CC the approval/disapproval of the waiver request. Info copy is sent to applicable MAJCOM. (as  appropriate)  notifies subordinate  units  of 4.4.4.  API-6/8/C/D  aircrew,  USAFWS  assigned  instructors,  nonrated  MAJCOM  Realistic Training program aircrew, NAF-assigned aircrew, test aircrew and API-5 aircrew physicians. 4.4.4.1.  This  paragraph  is  not  applicable  for  AFRC.  AFRC  responsibilities  for  API-6/8/C/D/staff flyers are contained in AFI 11-401/AFRC Sup 1. 4.4.4.2.  MAJCOM  Division  Chiefs,  NAF/A3,  and  USAFWS  8  WPS/CC  are  reviewing authorities for assigned personnel. They will: 4.4.4.2.1.  Ensure  appropriate  ARMS  data  is  maintained  and  provided  IAW  AFI  11 401. 4.4.4.2.2.  Provide  each  flyer  with  written  documentation  specifying  the  sortie  types and events  the  aircrew  member is  authorized to  fly.  API-6/8/C/D personnel  who fly with only one unit may receive this from their attached unit commander. 4.4.4.3.  Flying  personnel  identified  in  paragraph  4.4.4  are  to  accomplish  ground training items IAW paragraph 1.5.4.3.4 of this volume. 4.4.4.4.  Aircrew members will: 4.4.4.4.1.  Review accomplishments and currencies for accuracy. (T-3) 4.4.4.4.2.  Submit  qualification  and  authorization  documentation  to  the  supporting SQ/CC or DO prior to flying with that squadron. (T-3) 22 AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 4.4.4.5.  Instructor-qualified crewmembers may perform instructor duties, if qualified and current for the applicable missions/events. 4.4.5.  Events satisfactorily performed (Q or Q- with no additional training) on an evaluation may be used to establish or update currency in those events. 4.5.  Theater (Deployment) Training. 4.5.1.  IAW  AFI  11-202V1,  all  CMR/BMC  aircrew  members  will  complete  applicable theater training prior to assuming operational duties within that theater. 4.5.2.  A certification brief is given by the deploying crew to a squadron board. The squadron board  should,  at  a  minimum,  consist  of  the  CC/CD  (or  a  designated  representative)  and representatives from squadron weapons and tactics (DOW). 4.5.3.  Academic  training  for  forward  deployed  units/crews  for  operations  in  theater  or specific Areas of Operation. 513 ACG will develop this on an “as needed” basis to prepare for deployment. 4.6.  Logging of CT Requirements by Instructors/Evaluators. 4.6.1.  Instructors/Evaluators  will  perform  training  events  IAW  the  current  RAP  Tasking Message. (T-1) 4.6.2.  USAFWS  instructors  using  TDF/BC3  may  credit  all  controlling  events  while performing instructor/evaluator duties. 4.7.  Proration  of  End-of-Cycle  Requirements.  At  the  end  of  the  training  cycle,  the  SQ/CC may  prorate  all  training  requirements  when  DNIF,  emergency  leave,  formal  QT/MQT,  non-flying TDY, non-flying exercise, or a non-flying deployment precludes training for a portion of the training period. Normal annual leave is not considered as non-availability. 4.7.1.  Proration  is  based  on  cumulative  days  of  non-availability  in  the  training  cycle.  Use Table  4.6  to  determine  the  number  of  months  to  be  prorated.  The  number  of  months  an aircrew  member  is  not  available  for  flying  or  ATD  duties  is  entered  into  the  Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) which determines the prorated requirements. 4.7.2.  Aircrew members start continuation training the month following completion of MQT and receiving initial CMR/BMC certification.  Training accomplished during QT/MQT is not counted toward continuation training requirements. 4.8.  CMR/BMC Regression.  N-CMR/N-BMC aircrew members are not authorized to perform aircrew duties unless under instructor/evaluator supervision. Downgraded aircrew members must be recertified, in writing, by their squadron commander or designated representative. (T-3) 4.8.1.  Aircrew are regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC for one or more of the following reasons: 4.8.1.1.  Failure  to  complete  specified  Ground  Training  requirements  IAW  Table  4.1. Note:  If  downgraded  for  failure  to  meet  GS06,  LL05,  SS02,  SS03,  or  SS05  ground training,  the  member  has  the  same  status  as  a  BAQ  aircrew  member  as  defined  in paragraph 1.5.1.1. 4.8.1.2.  Failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.8.2. Note: CMR aircrew only. 4.8.1.3.  Failure to meet AFI 11-202V1 requirements not covered above. AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 23 4.8.1.4.  Receiving an overall Q3 grade on an INSTM, QUAL, or MSN evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2. 4.8.1.5.  At SQ/CC discretion. 4.8.2.  Lookback.  Both  1-month  and  3-month  sortie  lookback  periods  are  calculated  on  the first duty day of each month. Squadron commanders will determine the RAP level flown by using Table 4.5. (T-3) Note: Lookback does not apply to BMC or BAQ aircrew. 4.8.2.1.  Failure  to  Meet  1-Month  Lookback.  If  a  CMR  aircrew  member  does  not  meet their  RAP  1-month  lookback  requirements,  a  review  is  made  of  their  RAP  3-month lookback  requirements.  If  the  3-month  lookback  has  been  met,  aircrew  may,  at  SQ/CC discretion, remain in CMR status. 4.8.2.2.  Failure  to  Meet  3-Month  Lookback.  If  an  aircrew  member  fails  to  meet  the  3- month lookback requirement, SQ/CCs may: 4.8.2.2.1.  Regress the aircrew member to N-CMR status; or, 4.8.2.2.2.  Remove the aircrew member from a CMR manning position; or, 4.8.2.2.3.  Initiate action to remove the aircrew member from active flying status; or 4.8.2.2.4.  Place aircrew in probation status for 1 month (30 days). If SQ/CC chooses probation,  the  aircrew  member  reestablishes  a  1-month  lookback  at  the  end  of  the probation period to remain CMR. Probation status is documented in the individual’s training folder. 4.8.2.3.  Aircrew  members  that  regress  to  N-CMR  status  for  lookback  for  less  than  180 days  will  complete  a  SQ/CC  approved  re-certification  program  to  return  the  aircrew member  to  CMR  status.  (T-3)  Note:  At  a  minimum,  the  SQ/CC  training  plan  should consist of sorties equaling 1-month’s RAP requirement. 4.8.2.3.1.  Aircrew  will  complete  an  approved  training  plan  prior  to  regaining  CMR status  (see  paragraph  4.8.2.3).  (T-3)  The  allowable  elapsed  time  between  re-certification  sorties  is  no  greater  than  30  days.  In  addition,  1-month  lookback  starts the first full month of CMR status. The sorties and events accomplished during their re-certification  program  may  be  credited  towards  their  total  sortie  and  event requirements for the training cycle as well as for their monthly sortie requirement. 4.8.2.3.2.  Following re-certification to CMR status, aircrew members will meet a 1-month  lookback  to  maintain  CMR  until  a  3-month  lookback  is  established.  (T-1) SQ/CCs may apply probation rules, as described in paragraph 4.8.2.2.4. 4.8.2.4.  Lookback  computations  for  new  aircrew  members  begin  following  completion of  MQT.  1-Month  lookback  starts  the  first  full  month  of  CMR  status.  New  aircrew members who have been CMR less than 3 months will meet 1-month lookback to remain CMR until a 3-month lookback is established. (T-1) SQ/CCs may apply probation rules, as  described  in  paragraph  4.8.2.2.4,  if  a  new  CMR  aircrew  member  fails  to  meet  1-month lookback while establishing 3-month lookback. 4.8.3.  Aircrew  members  that  fail  to  meet  the  total  RAP  requirement  may  continue  CT  at CMR/BMC  as  determined  by  lookback  and  currency  requirements.  The  SQ/CC  will determine if additional training is required. 24 AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 4.9.  Dual  Qualifications.  For the purpose of this paragraph, dual  qualification is  qualification in  two  different  crew  positions  in  the  same  MDS  (i.e.  CSO/CT)  or  same  crew  position  in  two different MDS models (i.e. DRAGON modified/non-DRAGON modified E-3G, See Paragraph 4.9.3). The purpose of dual  qualifications is  to provide commanders with  flexibility in  meeting local training requirements on a case-by-case basis. 4.9.1.  Unit  commanders  may  dual  qualify  aircrew  members  based  upon  an  individual's experience, training history, and availability of training opportunities. 4.9.1.1.  Sq/CCs may appoint aircrew as Dual Qualified without attending FTU QT if the member  has  previously  held  the  crew  position  qualification  for  the  position  that  he/she will be dual qualified. The timeline associated with the type of requalification (either SQ prescribed TP or QT Syllabi) will be IAW Table 4.7 and Table 4.8. Example: A newly certified  ASO  can  be  made  dual  qualified  as  an  AWO.  This  dual  qualified  ASO/AWO will hold CMR/BMC status based on the Sq/CC’s discretion. 4.9.2.  Positional dual  qualified individuals will maintain CMR status  in their primary  crew position, as determined by the unit commander. (T-1) 4.9.2.1.  These individuals may also maintain CMR in both qualifications as long as full RAP requirements are met for each qualification. Alternately, the individual may assume BMC status in their secondary crew position. 4.9.3.  Pilot  and  Flight  Engineer  crew  positions  on  DRAGON-modified  aircraft  require  AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification. 4.10.  Ground Training Events.  Crewmembers will comply with ground training requirements found  in  Table  4.1.  NOTE:  Table  4.1  only  includes  ground  training  requirements  that specifically  apply  to  aircrew.  This  AFI  is  not  the  directive  authority  for  all  ground  training. Individuals  are  responsible  for  completing  additional  ground  training  requirements  as  specified in  AEF  Online  BAR/BDR  requirements  and  other  applicable  instructions  (i.e.  Reporting Instructions). 4.10.1.  Aircrew  members  who  fail  to  complete  ground  training  requirements  must  comply with  re-currency  requirements  in  paragraph  4.15  and  the  reference  directive.  (T-1)  See Table  4.1  for  a  listing  of  ground  training  subjects  and  training  periods  NOTE:  Where discrepancies exist, the reference directive takes precedence. Waiver authority for the ground training specified is IAW the reference directive. 4.10.2.  Theater  Employment  Training.  Academic  and  flying  training  for  forward  deployed units/crews for operations in theater or specific Areas of Operation. PACAF has an ongoing requirement for this training. 552 ACW and 513 ACG will develop this on an as needed basis to  prepare  for  deployment.  (T-3)  Squadrons  and  Operations  Groups  are  encouraged  to develop  other  means  to  enhance  aircrew  member’s  combat  readiness  to  support  squadron DOC statements. 4.11.  Training Requirements: 4.11.1.  Basic Mission Capable Training (BMC). BMC aircrew crew members complete 50% of the CMR/E RAP training requirements for all flying training and/or ATD events, but not less than one where only one is needed for CMR aircrew crew members. AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 25 4.11.1.1.  BMC  aircrew  crew  members  maintain  the  same  currencies  as  CMR  aircrew crew members. 4.11.1.2.  Lookback does not apply to BMC crewmembers. 4.11.1.3.  BMC aircrew crewmembers will complete ground training events identified as mandatory  grounding  items,  Table  4.1.  (T-1)  BMC  aircrew  will  also  complete  SS02, SS03, and SS05 training. (T-1) Additionally BMC aircrew will not deploy until current in all applicable ground training events. (T-1) 4.11.2.  CMR Training: 4.11.2.1.  Ground  Training  Requirements.  All  CMR  aircrew  crew  members  must complete the applicable training events listed in Table 4.1. in the specified time period. (T-1) 4.11.3.  Aircrew Training Device (ATD) Events: Specific ATD requirements are identified in the  applicable  RAP  tasking  message.  Additional  requirements  for  effective  training  events for each crew position are as follows: 4.11.3.1.  Flight Crew EP Scenario Simulator (MT17). Three-hour Simulation Scenarios include  normal  and  emergency  procedures  IAW  operational  flight  trainer  CTD.  An effective simulator sortie accomplishes a minimum of 75% of the training objectives. To credit  an  EP  Scenario  Simulator  event,  both  pilot  positions  and  the  FE  position  will  be occupied.  To  credit  EP  Scenario  Simulator  Observer  both  pilot  positions,  FE,  and observer  position  (Nav)  will  be  occupied.  These  events  will  be  tracked  IAW  the following task IDs: SQ60 (Sim Scenario 1); SQ61 (Sim Scenario 2); SQ62 (Sim Scenario 3); SQ63 (Sim Scenario 4). 4.11.3.2.  Pilot  Proficiency  Simulator  (MT42).  Three-hour  Pilot  Proficiency  Simulators emphasize  normal,  instrument,  and  emergency  procedures  transition  training  and  air refueling  events  IAW  operational  flight  trainer  Course  Training  Documents.  The  Pilot Proficiency Simulator is accomplished in the E-3 OFT and under government Contractor or USAF/CF/RAAF IP supervision. An effective simulator is one that a minimum of 75 percent of training objectives was accomplished.  o credit a Pilot Proficiency event, both pilot  positions  and  the  FE  position  are  occupied.  Note:  Either  a  FE  or  government contractor may occupy the FE position. 4.11.3.3.  Mission  Simulator  Live  Intercept  Training  Environment  (MSLITE).  MSLITE allows AWACS SD/AWO crewmembers to control live fighters from Tinker AFB using Air Defense Sector’s remote radar, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and communication feeds  from  coastal  sensor  sites.  It  also  allows  ASO/SST/AST  crewmembers  to  execute live Voice Tell training with the Air Defense Sectors. 4.11.3.3.1.  SD/AWO/ECO  may  log  recurring  flying  requirements  per  the  current RAP Tasking Message. 4.11.3.3.2.  ASO/SST/AST  may  log  recurring  flying  requirements  per  the  current RAP Tasking Message. 4.11.3.3.3.  USAFWS  Instructors  using  the  BC3  may  credit  all  controlled  events toward their recurring flying requirements on a one-for-one basis. USAFWS may use 26 AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 BC3 controlled missions to meet Table 4.4 mission crew controlled mission currency requirements. 4.11.4.  Flying  Training  Requirements:  Specific  flying  requirements  (events/currency)  are identified  in  Table  4.2,  Table  4.3,  and  Table  4.4.  Additional  requirements  for  effective training sorties for each crew position are as follows: 4.11.4.1.  All crew positions see Attachment 2 for CDTQT (ME08) guidance. 4.11.4.2.  Mission  crewmembers: For one deep  positions, no more than  2 crewmembers may claim an event on a single sortie. 4.11.4.3.  Pilot: 4.11.4.3.1.  Pilots may fly unsupervised while non-current for night landing and night air  refueling  on  sorties  planned  not  to  include  night  operations  or  autopilot-off  air refueling when AAR is not planned with SQ/DO approval. IPs may fly unsupervised while  non-current  for  touch-and-go  landings  on  sorties  planned  not  to  include  this event with SQ/DO approval. 4.11.4.3.2.  Takeoff,  Instrument  Approach,  Landing,  Night  Landing,  Touch-and-Go Landing, Air Refueling, and Night Air Refueling event currencies may be updated or regained in the E-3 OFT with the following restrictions: 4.11.4.3.3.  Events  are  accomplished  under  the  supervision  of  an  USAF/CF/RAAF IP/Flight Examiner or government contractor. 4.11.4.3.4.  Multiple  currency  updates  may  be  accomplished  in  the  E-3  OFT  within the  previously  established  aircraft  currency  window.  A  lost  currency  may  also  be regained in the OFT under the supervision of a USAF/CF/RAAF IP/Flight Examiner or  government  contractor.  Regardless  of  accomplishment  in  the  OFT,  if  the  time elapsed  since  the  event  was  performed  in  the  aircraft  is  more  than  two  times  the currency period, the member is non-current. 4.11.4.3.5.  Pilot Proficiency Flight. A Pilot Proficiency Flight fulfills the requirement for Pilot Proficiency Event listed in the current RTM. Pilots fly as the pilot in control in an airfield traffic (IFR or VFR) pattern for ideally 35 minutes and, during one crew duty  day,  accomplish  a  combination  of  at  least  six  (6)  of  the  traffic  pattern/air refueling  training  items  listed  below  (e.g.:  six  visual  patterns  count  as  six  separate events): 4.11.4.3.5.1.  Instrument  Approach  (precision,  including  autopilot-coupled  ILS approaches, and non-precision) 4.11.4.3.5.2.  Missed Approach (normal or simulated 3-engine) 4.11.4.3.5.3.  Circling Approach 4.11.4.3.5.4.  Visual pattern (closed traffic pattern, visual approach, or initial) 4.11.4.3.5.5.  Landing (normal / simulated 3-engine / 25-50 etc.) 4.11.4.3.5.6.  Landing Attitude Demo 4.11.4.3.5.7.  Combat Departures / Arrivals AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 27 4.11.4.3.5.8.  Published  Instrument  Approach  Procedure  (High  Penetration, Procedure Turn, etc.) 4.11.4.3.5.9.  Operations at other than the home airfield 4.11.4.3.5.10.  Air Refueling in the contact position for a minimum of 10 minutes (5 minutes for an IP/Flight Examiner) behind the tanker (starts from pre-contact, and Pilot In Command may extend this time based on student experience level). 4.11.4.3.5.11.  Auto-pilot off Air Refueling 4.11.4.3.5.12.  Air Refueling limits demo 4.11.4.3.6.  The criteria stated above are minimums.  The lead instructor  pilot  on the sortie determines if the  activity was of sufficient training value for the individual to log  a  pilot  proficiency  event.  Instructors  should  tailor  each  proficiency  sortie  to  the individual  pilot's  needs.  Particular  emphasis  should  be  placed  on  simulated  systems malfunctions,  simulated-engine  out  operations,  and  instrument  procedures.  IPs  will have individuals repeat maneuvers until proficient before crediting. 4.11.4.4.  Navigator: 4.11.4.4.1.  Air  Refueling  (A/R)  Rendezvous.  Navigator  successfully  completes  the rendezvous to 1 NM in trail of the tanker. 4.11.4.4.1.1.  A/R  Rendezvous  currency  may  be  updated  in  the  NPTT.  A  lost currency  may  also  be  regained  in  the  NPTT  under  the  supervision  of  a USAF/IN/EN  or  government  contractor.  Regardless  of  accomplishment  in  the NPTT,  if  the  time  elapsed  since  the  event  was  performed  in  the  aircraft  is  more than two times the currency period, the member is non-current. 4.11.4.5.  Flight Engineer: 4.11.4.5.1.  Sortie. FE occupies primary crew position for approximately 50% of any sortie and accomplishes normal operation. 4.12.  Cross Position Instruction. 4.12.1.  SD:  Qualified  ISDs  can  instruct  and  supervise  a  qualified  or  unqualified  weapons crew position other than their own (e.g. AWO, IAWO). 4.12.2.  Qualified  IAWOs  can  instruct  and  supervise  an  SD/ECO  regaining  currency  for  a controlled mission. 4.12.3.  Qualified  IASOs  can  instruct  and  supervise  qualified  or  unqualified  surveillance crew positions other than their own (i.e. SSTs, ISSTs, IASTs, or ASTs). 4.12.4.  Qualified ISSTs can instruct and supervise qualified or unqualified surveillance crew positions other than their own (i.e. IASTs, or ASTs). 4.13.  Swapping controllers/trackers: 4.13.1.  Swapping  of  controllers  is  prohibited  during  any  Controlled  Mission  (except  air refueling) accomplished in live flight or DMO. 4.13.2.  Swapping Trackers. An AST may hand off tracking responsibility to another AST so that  more  than  one  individual  may  log  a  tactical  tracking  event  for  a  single  set  of  activity. 28 AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 During  the  flight,  the SST and ASO determine whether the mission activity is  of sufficient quality and duration to provide adequate training for more than one tracker. 4.14.  Flight  Surgeons.  IAW  AFI  11-202V1,  Aircrew  Training,  give  assigned  and  attached flight surgeons every opportunity to fly in the unit’s primary mission aircraft. 4.14.1.  Flight surgeons will complete the following: (T-1) 4.14.1.1.  Flight physical IAW AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards. 4.14.1.2.  Physiological  training  IAW  AFI  11-403,  Aerospace  Physiological  Training Program. 4.14.1.3.  Life  support  and  ground  egress  training  IAW  Table  4.1  of  this  volume.Note: MDS-specific guidance IAW AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment Program. 4.14.1.4.  Cockpit/Crew  Resource  Management  (CRM/GA06/XGA06)  is  a  2-year requirement. 4.14.2.  Flight surgeon sortie and currency requirements are IAW AFI 11-202V1. 4.15.  Currency/Recurrency/Requalification. 4.15.1.  Currency. See Table 4.2., Table 4.3., and Table 4.4. for currency requirements. If an aircrew  member  loses  a  particular  currency  (or  had  never  established  a  currency  during  or since  initial  or  re-qualification  training),  that  sortie/event  may  not  be  performed  except  for the  purpose  of  gaining  currency  as  noted.  Instructors  will  be  qualified  and  current  in  all events they are instructing. (T-1) 4.15.2.  Recurrency. Recurrency guidelines are IAW AFI 11-202V1. 4.15.2.1.  Overdue training requirements are accomplished before the aircrew member is considered  qualified  to  perform  tasks  applicable  to  that  type  of  training.  Training annotated as affecting CMR/BMC status requires regression until appropriate training as specified  by  SQ/CC  is  accomplished.  Training  identified  as  not  affecting  CMR  status does  not  require  regression,  but  may  affect  crewmember’s  deployment  status.  The duration of grounding and status of sortie lookback determines the effect on CMR status. Currency  is  regained  under  instructor/evaluator  supervision.  See  Table  4.7  and  Table 4.8. Note: Flight surgeons may satisfy this requirement by successfully re-accomplishing the annual flight surgeon qualification examination. 4.15.2.2.  Aircrew members regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC or  grounded for expiration of ground training  currencies will complete any delinquent ground training  IAW reference directive as part of the SQ/CC directed training plan. (T-1) See Table 4.1 and paragraph 4.10. 4.15.2.3.  Dual Qualified CSO/CTs and CDMT/STs will perform delinquent training for the position in which recurrency is required. (T-1) 4.15.3.  Requalification.  Follow  guidance  IAW  AFI11-202V1,  applicable  MAJCOM supplement, and this instruction. 4.15.3.1.  Requalification training is used to requalify former E-3 crewmembers returning to  fly  mission  aircraft,  to  requalify  crewmembers  that  have  become  unqualified  due  to loss of currency per Table 4.7 and Table 4.8 (as applicable), or due to a downgrade by AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 29 the  squadron  commander  for  demonstrated  lack  of  ability.  An  aircrew  member  is unqualified upon either loss of currency per  Table  4.7 and  Table  4.8 (as applicable) or expiration of their qualification check, whichever occurs first. 4.15.3.2.  Aircrew  members  that  regress  to  N-CMR  status  for  lookback  will  follow guidance in paragraph 4.8.2. (T-1) 4.15.3.3.  Requalification requirements listed in Table 4.7 or Table 4.8 will be completed when  applicable.  The  date  used  to  calculate  whether  or  not  a  formal  training  course  is needed for re-qualification is be the date of the individual’s last flight. 4.15.3.4.  Dual Qualified CSO/CT and CDMT/ST will perform delinquent training for the position in which requalification is needed. (T-1) 4.15.3.5.  Aircrew  members  downgraded  to  UQ  for  a  demonstrated  lack  of  ability  must complete  remedial  training  prescribed  by  the  SQ/CC  and  fly  at  least  once  under Instructor/Flight Examiner supervision. (T-3) 4.15.3.6.  Instructors  who  become  unqualified  are  to  be  nominated  by  their  squadron commander prior to starting instructor requalification training. 4.15.3.7.  Basic  and  instructor  requalification  may  be  conducted  simultaneously. Reference  AFI  11-202V2  and  AFI  11-2E-3V2  for  guidance  on  simultaneous  instructor requalification and basic requalification evaluations. 4.15.3.8.

Non-Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR/N-BMC)—A crewmember who has completed IQT and passed  initial  ACC/PACAF  evaluation  (AFI  11-2E3V2),  but  is  not  certified  to  perform  tactical duties in support of E-3 roles and missions as defined in AFTTP 3-1 AWACS. Non-Tactical  Duties—Duties  involving  basic  operation  of  the  aircraft  and  aircraft  systems. These operations do not include tactical applications of wartime or contingency skills (e.g., non- tactical duties for pilots would include takeoff and landing, but would not include knowledge or proficiency in AFTTP 3-1 threat neutralization tactics). Operational  Mission—E-3  mission  with  primary  objectives  supporting  higher  headquarters tasked surveillance and/or control. Positional  Aircrew  Upgrade  Training—Prepares  crewmembers  to  perform  duties  in  a  higher level crew position. Tactical Duties—Those duties that would be performed in a contingency or wartime operations. These duties vary by crew position, are trained during MQT, and may be performed for training purposes  during  peacetime  CONUS  or  overseas  sorties  (e.g.,  performance  of  duties  wearing CWD equipment or control of intercepts during air defense operations). Training Mission—E-3 mission with primary objectives of completion of E-3 aircrew member training and/or support of other participating unit’s training. Unqualified  (UQ)—Aircrew members who are not qualified to fly or operate E-3 systems and equipment unless they are under the supervision of a qualified instructor in the applicable crew position. Weapons  Systems  Academic  Training  (WSAT)—Quarterly  academic  training  designed  to provide crewmembers with information  on tactics, employment,  training  and evaluation  trends, procedures, and changes to E-3 software and equipment.  AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 45 Attachment 2 FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS FOR CHEMICAL DEFENSE TASK QUALIFICATION TRAINING A2.1.  Flight  Frequency.  Aircrew  members  fly  only  once  on  the  days  Chemical  Warfare Defense (CWD) gear is worn in flight. A2.2.  Long Underwear Restriction.  When ambient air temperature exceeds 70 degrees F, the long underwear is not worn during continuation training flights. A2.3.  Pilot Wear of CWD Gear.  Only one pilot at a time wears the CWD gear during flight. The squadron commander ensures a qualified pilot who is not wearing CWD gear has access to the  flight  controls  during  CWD  pilot  training.  Note:  Pilots  will  not  wear  CWD  gear  during critical phases of flight. A2.4.  Wear  of  CWD  Gear When  Mission  Profiles  Exceed  2  Hours.  When mission profiles exceed 2 hours, equipment can be removed in flight. Equipment must be worn for a minimum of 15 minutes. A2.5.  Hot  Weather  Ramp  Time.  During  hot  weather  (70  degrees  F  or  higher),  ramp  time should be limited to no more than 45 minutes. A2.6.  Currency.  Aircrew  members  will  complete  Chemical  Defense  Task  /  Qualification Training annually.  46 AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 Attachment 3 SITUATIONAL EMERGENCY PROCEDURES TRAINING A3.1.  GS03  -  Situational  Emergency  Procedures  Training  (SEPT):  This  training  is  not  an evaluation,  but  a review  of  abnormal/emergency  procedures  and  aircraft  systems operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. SEPTs should be accomplished in small groups so all members may participate to the fullest extent possible. Aircrews are highly encouraged to conduct  SEPT  training  during  mission  planning.  One  crewmember  should  present  an abnormal/emergency  situation  and  the  group  should  discuss  actions  necessary  to  cope  with  the malfunction and carry the scenario to a logical conclusion. A3.2.  SEPT  Currency:  SEPT  will  be  accomplished  each  calendar  month,  and  the  currency expires  at  the  end  of  the  following  month.  Failure  to  accomplish  by  the  end  of  the  following month precludes the member from flying unsupervised until subsequently completed. A3.2.1.  Formal course SEPTs may satisfy the monthly SEPT requirement for the instructor who administers this training. A3.2.2.  Incorporate the following elements into squadron SEPT training programs: A3.2.2.1.  SQ/CC or DO involvement in the selection of monthly SEPT topics. A3.2.2.2.  Develop SEPT scenarios using E-3 mishaps/incidents as baseline DOCs. A3.2.2.3.  Ensure  each  SEPT  session  discusses  at  least  two  (2)  Emergency  procedures scenarios.  Training  consists  of  an  emergency  procedures  discussion  of  a  realistic emergency situation and actions necessary to  cope with  the malfunction. Training starts with  the  initial  indications  of  system  malfunctions  through  checklist  procedures  to  a logical  conclusion.  Discussion  of  affected  system  indications,  effects  on  other  systems, aircraft performance, mission degradation, and crew coordination is also included. A3.2.2.4.  SEPTs should be accomplished in the best available simulator. If a simulator is not available, SEPTs should be accomplished one-on-one or in small flight-sized groups as  long  as  all  members  participate  fully  and  share  equal  time  responding  to  emergency situations. A3.3.  Emergency procedures training conducted in continuation training ATDs may be credited towards  SEPT.  Simulated  crew  coordination  drills  performed  in  flight  are  not  credited  towards SEPT  unless  they  are  accompanied  by  an  in-depth  prebrief  and  debrief  which  meets  the  SEPT training standards.  AFI11-2E-3V1  26 JUNE 2017 47 Attachment 4 SAMPLE SQ WAIVER REQUEST LETTER—RECURRING FLYING TRAINING REQUIREMENTS Figure A4.1.
