          QTP4Y0X2-1   04 February 2016 DENTAL LABORATORY SPECIALTY Volume 1. General Dental Laboratory Experience 381st Training Squadron 2931 Harney Road Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 INTRODUCTION Volume 1, General Dental Laboratory Experience, Qualification Training Package (QTP) contains modules on use of infection control practices, constructing casts and custom trays, mounting casts and repairing prostheses.  This QTP is designed to enhance 5- and 7-skill level  on-the-job training (OJT) of dental laboratory personnel.  Training references listed in each module may be used to compliment training.  All QTPs are intended to be used by trainees, trainers, supervisors, and task certifiers.  Before initiating any training you should review your responsibilities as a supervisor/trainer for conducting OJT per AFI 36-2201, Chapter 6, Air Force Training Program On-The-Job Training Administration.   QTPs are instructional packages designed to help you conduct and evaluate your field training.  Once you begin upgrade training you are required to use the QTPs.  QTPs provide continuity to the trainee’s upgrade training and are divided into the following volumes:  1) General Dental Laboratory Experience; 2) Fixed Prosthodontics; 3) Treatment and Orthodontic Appliances, Complete and Removable Dental Prostheses; 4) Dental Laboratory Administration; 5) Medical Material; and 6) Supervision and Training.  The QTP modules were designed to assistyou in preparing for and conducting training.  Each module segments the major tasks into teachable elements.  Your goal is to provide enough training and guidance so trainees can do all task related steps, without assistance and produce an appliance or prosthesis that meets local requirements and fabrication standards for speed and accuracy.  QTPs also aid OJT task certifiers in evaluating the trainee’s demonstrated performance.  If you have local training requirements not covered by a QTP module you should develop “steps in performance” and “performance checklists” that support and standardize those tasks.   When you are satisfied the trainee meets standards, as prescribed in the QTP performance checklist, you must document each task completion in the QTP tab.  If a person is being recertified on a task that is supported by a QTP, you must use that module to complete the recertification process.   Typically, you will manage each module by first, training the tasks and then, evaluating performance.  Your local steps in performance may vary from the method listed in the QTP module.  If this is the case, you are authorized to make changes to the first half of each module, (i.e. steps in task performance); however, the “performance checklist” is considered a standard and cannot be altered.  You may train each QTP volume/module in any sequence; however, when conducting training use an organized and methodical approach.  This will reduce your training time and enhance your efforts. 2 Introduction For effective use of this QTP, conduct training in the following manner: 1. Review the procedures in each module with the trainee.2. Direct the trainee to review the training references listed to prepare for task performance.3. Review the steps in task performance with the trainee, allowing enough time to adequatelytrain each step (some modules may take longer to teach).4. Evaluate the trainee’s work at each critical step using the performance checklist at thispoint will be helpful.5. Evaluate the trainee’s performance and provide feedback on any area for improvement.6. Finally, when the trainee has successfully completed the task you must document the STS.It the trainee does not accomplish the module, conduct follow-up instruction until thetrainee successfully completes the task.The QTP project goal of the 381st Training Squadron, Fort Sam Houston TX, is to publish a useable document for trainers and trainees.  You are encouraged to write-in changes or revisions to the QTPs.  A corrections/improvements letter is located on the last page of each QTP volume.  You may choose to call in your recommendations to DSN 420-1950 or FAX DSN/Commercial (210) 808-2250 or email the author at daniel.stellabotte.mil@mail.mil.

Once the mounting plate is attached to the upper member, remove the incisal guide pin 4.  Loosen the three thumbscrews on the top of the facebow frame to allow attachment to                 the articulator NOTE:  Placing the upper member of the articulator on top of a case pan at this time for  stability would be helpful 5.  Place pins on the outer surfaces of the condylar guides into the holes on the inner surfaces of the plastic earpieces 6.  Tighten the three thumbscrews on the Facebow 7.  Place the upper frame and attached Facebow back onto the lower frame of the articulator 8.  Seat cast into the occlusal bite registration record 9.  Attach maxillary cast to upper frame with mounting stone   10. Support the cast as you close upper frame down until it touches the transverse bar of the 11.

Accurately seat the maxillary cast into the occlusal bite registration       record  6.  Attach maxillary cast firmly to upper member, ensure upper frame       touches transverse bar of Facebow 7.  Contour stone to expose cast junction and smooth the mounting 8.  Mount the mandibular cast using arbitrary method   YES NO                                FEEDBACK:   Use this checklist as a source of information; discuss the trainee’s performance indicating strengths and weaknesses, suggested improvements, etc.  If the trainee performed all steps of the task satisfactorily, both the trainer and the trainee should acknowledge performance by appropriately documenting the AFTR 24 MODULE 8:  REPAIR REMOVABLE PROSTHESES USING ACRYLIC RESIN 3.7.  Repair removable prostheses using acrylic resin STS TASK REFERENCE(S):   TRAINING REFERENCE(S):  AFPAM 47-103V1, Dental Laboratory Technology-Basic Sciences, Removable      Prosthodontics and Orthodontics             4Y052 CDC, Vol. 4, Removable Prosthodontics  EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:   Due to the availability of cases in your laboratory, training on acrylic repair procedures may be limited.  Select actual cases or use “training” cases for demonstration and performance. Demonstrate how to assemble broken denture pieces and construct casts or stone matrices. Demonstrate repairing fractured complete or removable partial denture bases. Discuss probable causes for denture breakage and solutions to prevent the problem from recurring. Stress returning the repaired appliance to the dentist as quickly as possible.  Have the trainee perform acrylic repair procedures and suggest ways to improve performance. After ensuring the trainee has received sufficient practice, evaluate his/her abilities using the performance checklist. 1.  Align fragments or pieces of denture base  2.  Sticky wax broken denture pieces together 3.  Stabilize large repair areas using hanger wire or old burs and sticky wax 4.  Blockout undercuts of denture base areas not in the repair site 5.  Vacuum mix dental stone 6.  Vibrate stone into denture base to construct matrix/cast 7.  Separate matrix/cast from denture base 8.  Trim cast using cast trimmer 9.
