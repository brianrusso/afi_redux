SUMMARY OF CHANGES This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed in its entirety. AFI21-136  3 FEBRUARY 2017 3 Chapter 1 GENERAL PURPOSE AND SCOPE 1.1.  Purpose:  This  instruction  outlines  overall  management  responsibilities  for  aircraft  sun shades,  crew  shelters  and  portable/inflatable  shelters.  Additionally,  it  provides  guidance  and  a standardized approach to procure and sustain these equipment items. 1.2.  Scope:  Applies  to  all  AF  units  possessing  or  procuring  these  equipment  items  to  support logistics  operations  and  flight  line  or  maintenance  areas.  This  includes  conventional  force logistics units; nuclear and nuclear support units; cyber and space; special operations; wholesale-level  procurement,  sustainment,  and  maintenance;  aerial  port  squadrons;  logistics  readiness squadrons;  research,  test,  and  development  units.    It  does  not  include  medical  logistics,  civil engineering logistics, security forces units and communications units. 1.2.1.  Aircraft  sun  shades  and  other  shelter  types  as  defined  below  and  addressed  in  this instruction are considered equipment  items  for accountability purposes and will be tracked/ accounted  for  on  appropriate  documents  on  a  Custodian  Authorization/Custody  Receipt Listing  (CA/CRL)  and  managed  IAW AFMAN 23-122, Material Management Procedures. (T-1). 1.2.1.1.  These  assets  are  not  listed  on  unit  authorized  equipment  tables  of  allowance because they are not  required support equipment  for weapons systems.  These assets are the responsibility of the owning organization. 1.2.1.2.  Commanders  will  ensure  all  other  applicable  organizations  with  appropriate subject matter expertise are involved in the procurement, installation, repair, sustainment, and replacement of these assets. (T-1). 1.3.  Definitions. 1.3.1.  Aircraft Sun Shades:  Structure with the sole purpose of providing minimal protection for personnel from the elements (sun, wind, rain, snow, etc., excluding lightning) with a roof and a maximum of two sides. 1.3.1.1.  Aircraft  sun  shades  are  not  considered  as  temporary  or  relocatable  facilities associated with Military Construction (MILCON) projects.  Procedures for temporary or relocatable  facilities  associated  with  MILCON  projects  are  contained  in  AFI  32-1021, Planning  and  Programming  Military  Construction  (MILCON)  Projects.    Relocatable buildings are designed to be readily erected, disassembled, stored, moved, and reused to meet a short-term requirement for facilities due to either transitory peak requirements or urgent  requirements  pending  approval,  such  as  construction  of  facilities  via  normal military construction programs. According to AFI 32-1021, Chapter 6, Relocatable and Temporary  Facilities,  the  terms  temporary  and  relocatable  are  interchangeable.   Furthermore, AFI 32-1021 provides guidance on satisfying interim facility requirements using relocatable or temporary facilities.  Aircraft sun shades are not incident or interim to  a  MILCON  project,  nor  are  they    in    place    to    meet    a    temporary    requirement;  therefore  the  terms  temporary  or relocatable as used in AFI 32-1021 do not apply to aircraft sunshades 4 AFI21-136  3 FEBRUARY 2017 1.3.1.2.  Aircraft sun shades are not intended to replace aircraft maintenance hangars and as such there is  no requirement associated  with  aircraft specifications or square  footage allowances contained in AFI 32-1024, Standard Facilities Requirements, or AFMAN 32-1084, Facility Requirements. 1.3.2.  Crew Shelters:  Any portable or prefabricated structure placed inside, under or erected to  support  activities  within  an  aircraft  sun  shade,  hangar,  hardened  aircraft  shelter  or protective aircraft shelter.  These should not be confused with other shelters that are designed for personnel protection only (e.g. End-of-Runway shacks). 1.3.3.  Portable/Inflatable  shelters:    A  structure  constructed  using  layers  of  membrane connected  together  using  pressurized  air  to  produce  a  structure  which  covers  limited  areas (e.g. cargo aircraft engine, open fuel tanks) of an aircraft or equipment. 1.3.4.  Allied support: Utilities (e.g. electrical, water, air, communications, etc.) provided up to  a  stub  at  each  aircraft  sun  shade.  Utilities  are  real  property  assets.  Installation  of  new utility services carries a work classification of Construction.  See paragraph 2.8. AFI21-136  3 FEBRUARY 2017 5 Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  Headquarters Air Force 2.1.1.
