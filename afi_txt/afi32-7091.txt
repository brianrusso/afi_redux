This  Air  Force  Instruction  (AFI)  provides information,  guidance,  and requirements  to  ensure  Air  Force  environmental  programs  at  enduring  locations  outside  the United  States  (also  referred  to  as  “overseas”)  achieve  and  maintain  environmental  quality  as prescribed in AFPD 32-70.  The goal of this AFI is to ensure an effective framework to meet Air Force  environmental  obligations  overseas  while  meeting  the  mission  in  air,  space,  and cyberspace.  Environmental quality (EQ) is a measure of the condition of the Air Force’s Natural Infrastructure  (NI)  relative  to  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  environmental  requirements.  Proper  EQ  management  overseas  enables  the  Air  Force  to  optimize  natural  infrastructure resources  for  its  use  and  to  protect  its  people,  equipment,  and  facilities  from  environmental threats while performing Air Force missions in foreign countries worldwide. 1.2.  Scope.  This AFI identifies environmental compliance, remediation and EIAP requirements unique to overseas installations and activities, but references, where appropriate, other AFIs that apply worldwide (e.g., Table 3.2 of this AFI). 1.3.  Applicability. 1.3.1.  Unless  otherwise  noted,  this  AFI  applies  to  Air  Force  installations,  activities  and operations  at  enduring  locations  outside  the  United  States.    This  AFI  applies  to  the  whole spectrum of military operations except as noted. 1.3.2.  This instruction does not apply to contingency locations as defined in DoDD 3000.10. 1.3.3.  This Instruction does not address encroachment. 1.4.  Policy. 1.4.1.  It is Air Force policy to comply with and implement the environmental provisions of all  applicable  international  agreements  (IA),  Executive  Orders  (E.O.),  DoD  issuances,  and Air Force policies, to include relevant DoD Directives and AFIs.  In addition, the Air Force will  comply  with  applicable  environmental  policies  issued  by  the  Geographic  Combatant Commands  (GCC)  and  DoD  Lead  Environmental  Components  (LEC)  which  implement  or supplement DoD overseas environmental policy. 1.4.2.  For activities and operations that occur outside the United States, the primary sources of  environmental  requirements  for  DoD-controlled  enduring  locations  are  DoD  issuances (e.g., the Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD)), GCC issuances, LEC  policy  (e.g.,  country-specific  Final  Governing  Standards  (FGS)  and  remediation standards),  and  any  binding  IA,  as  defined  by  and  concluded  IAW  DoDD  5530.3, International  Agreements,  and  AFI  51-701,  Negotiating,  Concluding,  Reporting,  and Maintaining International Agreements, to which the United States is a party (e.g., Status of Forces Agreement, Defense Economic Cooperation Agreement). 1.4.3.  Offices  of  Primary  Responsibility  for  AFIs  that  will  affect  EQ  programs  worldwide will formally coordinate with AF/A4C and consult with the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC)  Overseas  Subject  Matter  Expert  (SME)  during  the  drafting  process  and  before 6 AFI32-7091  18 MARCH 2016 formal  coordination.    This  will  ensure  that  the  unique  nature  of  overseas  operations  is addressed appropriately in guidance for overseas locations. 1.4.3.1.  The  "unique  nature"  includes:    1)  Air  Force  does  not  own  real  property  for overseas installations (locations are provided for Air Force use by the host nation (HN)); 2)  few  US  federal  environmental  laws  and  regulations  apply  overseas;  3)  international law  and  agreements  define  environmental  requirements;  4)  operational  considerations (e.g. GCC policy and HN preferences and sensitivities) must be considered; 5) costs can be  higher  overseas  versus  US;  6)  remediation  is  permitted  under  very  limited circumstances;  and  7)  frequent  turnover  of  personnel  creates  challenges  with  continuity and adequate staffing. 1.5.  Legal  and  Other  Requirements.  Outside  the  United  States,  Air  Force  operations  and personnel  are  only  subject  to  US  federal  environmental  laws,  regulations,  and  policies  if explicitly  required  by  an  Act  of  Congress,  an  E.O.,  the  decision  of  an  appropriate  US  federal court, a binding IA, DoD policy, or an AFI. 1.5.1.  Air  Force  activities  and  personnel  will  comply  with  the  primary  sources  of  overseas environmental requirements identified in Paragraph 1.4.2 above. (T-0). 1.5.2.  This  instruction  supplements  and  complements  the  primary  sources  of  overseas environmental requirements.  Primary sources of environmental requirements supersede this AFI.    If  complying  with  this instruction conflicts  with  other requirement  sources (e.g., AFI 32-7001,  Environmental  Management,  or  other  AFI),  contact  the  appropriate  intermediate environmental function (IEF) or AFCEC/CZ for guidance. (T-1). 1.5.3.  A  unit  or  organization  that  disagrees  with  an  LEC  or  GCC  decision  that  affects  the unit  or  organization  may  request  reconsideration  of  the  decision.    Installations  must  submit reconsideration requests through the operational  chain  of command  and/or through  AFCEC to  ensure  higher  headquarters  (HHQ)  review  and  endorsement  before  going  to  the  LEC  or GCC. (T-1). 1.5.4.  Exceptions, Waivers, and Deletions. 1.5.4.1.  Installations and installation-level  units and organizations shall seek exceptions from,  waivers  of,  and  deletion  of  requirements  specified  in  applicable  DoD,  GCC,  or LEC  policies  (e.g.,  a  DoDI,  GCC  regulation,  country-specific  FGS  provision,  and OEBGD mandate) IAW the waiver, exception, or deletion provisions of those applicable policies.  (T-0).    Paragraph  3.4.10  of  this  AFI  addresses  waiver,  exception,  and  deletion criteria  and  processes  under  the  applicable  DoD,  GCC,  and  LEC  environmental compliance.  See Paragraph 4.4.6 for exceptions to remediation requirements authorized under DoDI 4715.08. 1.5.4.2.  For waiver of requirements specified in this instruction, follow the criteria listed in the introductory paragraph on page 2 of this instruction. 1.6.  Programming for Overseas Environmental Requirements. 1.6.1.  IAW  AFI  32-7001,  Environmental  Management,  AFCEC  will  assist  overseas installations  with  programming  and  budgeting,  and  if  needed,  identify  and  program requirements on behalf of the installation for environmental requirements stemming from:  1) DoDI 4715.05, country-specific  FGS,  or the OEBGD if  no FGS  exists;  2) obligations from AFI32-7091  18 MARCH 2016 7 IAs; 3) DoDI 4715.08; 4) EIAP for all major Air Force actions that pose significant harm to the  environment  of  places  outside  the  United  States;  and  5)  any  additional  DoD  and  Air Force environmental policies that apply to overseas installations and activities. (T-0). 1.6.2.  When programming and budgeting for overseas requirements, enduring location (e.g., installation)  Program  Element  Monitors  (PEMs)  must  consider  the  unique  attributes  of overseas operations specified in Paragraph 1.4.4 of this AFI. (T-1).  Program environmental requirements IAW the EQ Programming Guidance in AFI 32-7001, Chapter 4. 1.7.  Training.  Unit  commanders  will  ensure  overseas  personnel  receive  applicable  training required by law, regulation or DoD and AF policy, and will document completion of that training on  AF  Form  623,  On-the-Job  Training  Record,  AF  Form  623a,  On-the-Job  Training  Record Continuation Sheet, or equivalent document. (T-0). 1.8.  Higher  Headquarters  (HHQ)  Notification.  Numbered  Air  Forces  (NAFs),  installation, and  installation-level  units  and  organizations  will  notify  their  assigned  MAJCOM/A4/7C  and Judge Advocate (JA) of environmental issues, incidents  or developments  that might  impact  the installation,  MAJCOM,  LEC,  or  GCC  mission.    Notification  will  be  made  within  one  (1) business day through the chain of command to the appropriate IEF. (T-1).  Examples of incidents and developments that must be reported to HHQ include, but are not limited to: 1.8.1.  Receipt  of  HN  enforcement  actions  (as  defined  in  AFI  32-7047,  Environmental Compliance,  Release,  and  Inspection  Reporting).    This  notification  can  be  accomplished through the AFCEC Enforcement Actions, Spills, and Inspections (EASI) database. 1.8.2.  Significant spills or releases of contaminants into the environment.  This notification can be accomplished through the Spill  Incident  Release  Internet  System  (SIRIS) module of EASI. 1.8.3.  Significant proposed changes to country-specific FGS. 1.8.4.  Discovery of environmental contamination on Air Force installations that is likely to pose a substantial impact to human health and safety. 1.8.5.

Scope.  This  chapter  provides  environmental  compliance  requirements  for  Air  Force installations and other enduring locations overseas.  It establishes media or program area-specific standards  and  processes  applicable  to  routine  activities  and  operations  at  enduring  locations  in order to prevent or reduce negative impacts on the environment and/or mission success. 3.2.  Applicability.  This chapter implements and supplements DoDI 4715.05 and related DoDIs, such  as  DoDD  4715.12,  Environmental  and  Explosives  Safety  Management  on  Operational Ranges  Outside  the  United  States.    It  applies  to  Air  Force  installations  and  other  enduring locations  identified  in  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  (OSD)-approved  Enduring Locations  Master  List,  maintained  by  the  Office  of  the  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Policy OUSD(P)  and  available  on  the  SIPRNet,  as  well  as  other  organizations  specified  on  page  1  of this  AFI.    Contact  the  appropriate  IEF  or  HQ  USAF/A4C  OPR  regarding  applicability  of  this chapter  or  other  environmental  media  or  program-specific  AFIs,  and  for  assistance  resolving conflicts between this AFI and other environmental media or program-specific AFIs. 3.3.  Background.  DoDI  4715.05  establishes  the  framework  for  media  and  program-specific environmental  compliance  requirements  that  apply  to  DoD  installations  and  other  enduring locations outside the United States.  The OEBGD provides minimum environmental compliance standards and is the starting point for developing country-specific FGS.  The OEBGD applies to enduring locations in countries where no FGS have been established.  The FGS apply to all DoD enduring  installations  and  activities  in  a  foreign  country  unless  an  exemption  or  exception specified  in  DoDI  4715.05  or  the  appropriate  FGS  apply.  The  OSD-designated  LEC  for  a particular  country  prepares  and  maintains  the  FGS,  consulting  with  HN  authorities  on appropriate  environmental  issues,  consulting  with  affected  DoD  Components  and  the  GCC  on significant  issues  arising  from  DoD  environmental  policy  in  that  country,  acting  on  FGS exception  requests,  providing  DoD  Components  country-specific  remediation  guidance,  and keeping DoD Components informed of current environmental developments and trends. 3.4.  Policy.  Air Force installations and other enduring locations will: 3.4.1.  Comply with FGS criteria in countries where FGS exist. (T-0). 3.4.2.  In countries where no FGS exist, comply with applicable IAs and the OEBGD.  Seek assistance  from  the  IEF  and  servicing  legal  office  or  from  the  appropriate  LEC  (if  any)  in determining if a conflict exists between the OEBGD and an applicable IA. (T-0). 3.4.3.  Comply  with  applicable  GCC  and  LEC  environmental  compliance  policies  (e.g., regulations, instructions, and memoranda) issued separate from the country-specific FGS or the  OEBGD.  (T-0).    Such  policies  may  supplement  topics  addressed  in  the  FGS  or  the OEBGD.    However,  they  also  may  address  environmental  and  environment-related  topics that are not addressed in the FGS or OEBGD, such as Noise and Radon management. 3.4.4.  Comply  with  DoD  and  Air  Force  directives,  instructions,  and  policies  (e.g.,  AFI  32-7001, AFI 32-7040, MAJCOM policy) that apply overseas to the extent compliance does not conflict with satisfying applicable IA, FGS, OEBGD, GCC, or LEC requirements described AFI32-7091  18 MARCH 2016 17 in  Paragraphs  3.4.1  through  3.4.3  of  this  AFI.  (T-0).    Consult  the  IEF  and  servicing  legal office for assistance in resolving conflicts between different requirement sources. (T-1). 3.4.5.  Expeditionary  facilities  and  activities.    This  AFI  does  not  address  expeditionary  or contingency  operations;  however,  any  expeditionary  activities  that  take  place  on  enduring locations  shall  comply  with  environmental  requirements  in  applicable  IAs,  GCC  (i.e.,  the Environmental  Annex  of the  Contingency  Operation’s  Plan/Operation’s  Order (OPLAN/OPORD), GCC regulations) and LEC  issuances, and other applicable  requirement sources specified in Paragraphs 3.4.1 through 3.4.4 of this AFI. (T-0). 3.4.6.  Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) and tenant activities. 3.4.6.1.  Enduring  GSUs  shall  comply  with  Paragraphs  3.4.1  through  3.4.5  of  this  AFI. (T-0). 3.4.6.2.  Tenant  activities  at  Air  Force-controlled  enduring  locations  shall  comply  with Paragraphs 3.4.1 through 3.4.5 of this AFI. (T-0). 3.4.6.3.  Air  Force  activities  at  enduring  locations  that  are  controlled  by  other  DoD Components  (e.g.,  US  Army,  US  Navy)  shall  comply  with  the  policies  described  in Paragraphs 3.4.1 through 3.4.4 of this instruction that apply to the host installation. (T-0).  Such  activities  will  comply  with  AFIs  and  other  Air  Force  policy  to  the  extent compliance  does  not  conflict  with  satisfying  other  DoD  Components’  requirements  that apply to tenants at the host installation. (T-1). 3.4.6.4.  Air Force activities at enduring locations controlled by a US military ally (e.g., Royal Australian Air Force Base) or US coalition partner (e.g., NATO base) shall comply with the  applicable  IAs, environmental annexes of operation orders (OPORDs), or other requirement sources. (T-0). the  environmental  compliance  standards  specified in 3.4.7.  Leased facilities.  Air Force activities at enduring locations it leases shall comply with the environmental standards prescribed in the lease.  In addition, they shall comply with the policies identified in Paragraphs 3.4.1 through 3.4.6 of this AFI, but only to the extent these policies do not conflict with lease requirements. (T-0). 3.4.8.  Operational ranges.  Range operators shall ensure that overseas operational ranges that are  enduring  locations  shall  comply  with  the  environmental  criteria  specified  in  applicable IAs and country-specific FGS, or the OEBGD where no FGS exists. (T-0). 3.4.9.  Supplementary criteria.  Any organization may supplement this compliance guidance but  must  coordinate  all  supplements  with  HQ  USAF/A4C  and  will  consult  with  the appropriate LEC before issuing supplementary criteria that is more protective than the FGS or OEBGD. (T-1).  However, if the Air Force is the LEC, consult with the appropriate GCC instead  of  the  LEC.  (T-1).    Requests  to  supplement  criteria  will  be  staffed  through  the  IEF and  the  ITAFHQ.  (T-1).

(T-1). AFI32-7091  18 MARCH 2016 25 Chapter 4 ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS 4.1.  Scope.  This  chapter  specifies  requirements  for  remediation  authorization,  prohibitions, limitations  and  site  investigations  concerning  environmental  contamination  on  overseas installations and other  enduring overseas locations (e.g.,  facilities)  controlled by the Air Force. The chapter does not supersede or amend any applicable IA respecting remediation of Air Force environmental  contamination  overseas.    It  integrates  concepts  of  sustainable  operations  and natural  infrastructure  asset  management,  and  is  consistent  with  the  Air  Force’s  EMS  and  EQ PPBE  requirements  established  in  AFI  32-7001.    Section  4.7  of  this  chapter  provides  a procedural  overview  of  essential  remediation  program  elements  to  help  operationalize  and streamline installation and ITAFHQ activities. 4.2.  Applicability. 4.2.1.  This  chapter  applies  to  remediation  of  environmental  contamination  located  at  Air Force  installations  and  other  enduring  locations.    It  does  not  apply  to  remediation  of contamination outside the boundaries of Air Force-controlled installations or facilities unless such remediation is required by a binding IA. 4.2.2.  This chapter also applies to remediation of environmental contamination on Air Force-controlled  ranges  located  in  foreign  countries,  but  only  if  it  does  not  conflict  with  the requirements of a binding IA regarding use of ranges. 4.2.3.  This chapter does not apply to spill and release responses governed by DoDI 4715.05, the OEBGD, or country-specific FGS. 4.2.4.  This chapter does not cover remediation of contamination caused by DoD operations pertaining  to  actual  or  threatened  hostilities,  security  assistance  programs,  peacekeeping missions, or relief operations.  It does not apply to Air Force contingency locations. for 4.3.  Background.  DoDI  4715.08  updates  policy, remediation  of  environmental  contamination  on  DoD  installations  outside  the  United  States.  This  chapter  implements  and  supplements  DoDI  4715.08,  and  provides  limitations  and prohibitions for conducting remediation overseas. responsibilities  and  procedures 4.4.  Policy. 4.4.1.  Air  Force  commands  and  components  will  take  prompt  action  to  address  substantial impact to human health and safety (SIHS) due to contamination caused by DoD or Air Force activities and is located on an Air Force installation, co-located base, or Air Force-controlled enduring location IAW DoDI 4715.08 and this chapter. (T-0). 4.4.2.  For  environmental  contamination  located  on  an  Air  Force  installation  that  is  not known  to  be  caused  by  DoD  or  Air  Force  activities,  Air  Force  commands  and  components may  only  take  action  to  address  the  contamination  if  it  poses  an  SIHS  to  US  forces  or personnel.   Prior to  investigation actions, approval  must be obtained from  the  ITAFHQ/CC or  delegated  authority.  (T-0).    However,  US  remedial  action  may  be  taken  after  the appropriate  command  or  component,  with  the  assistance  of  the  GCC  and  LEC,  formally 26 AFI32-7091  18 MARCH 2016 seeks  remediation  performed  or  funded  by  the  HN  and  obtains  written  concurrence  from ASD(EI&E). 4.4.3.  An applicable IA may require the Air Force to perform remediation that may be more extensive  than  that  necessary  to  address  an  SIHS.    Before  an  Air  Force  command  or component begins such remediation, it must consult with the LEC, if any, and obtain a legal determination  from  a  level  no  lower  than  the  ITAFHQ  that  the  requirement  for  such remediation is mandatory and arises from a binding IA. (T-0). 4.4.4.  DoDI  4715.08  allows  the  Air  Force  to  perform  limited  remedial  action  needed  to undertake  an  approved  MILCON  project  or  other  construction  type  projects  (e.g.,  repair, maintenance). However, such remediation must be funded by construction project funds (i.e., MILCON  or  other  construction/sustainment,  restoration,  and  modernization  (SRM)  funds).  Any  remediation  beyond  that  needed  for  the  construction  to  proceed  must  comply  with  the non-MILCON provisions of DoDI 4715.08. (T-0). 4.4.5.  Remediation  of  environmental  contamination,  in  addition  to  that  specified  in  this chapter,  may  be  undertaken  by  the  HN  using  its  own  resources  during  US  use  of  the  Air Force-controlled installation, subject to Air Force mission and security requirements. 4.4.6.  No  other  remediation  beyond  that  specified  in  this  section  may  be  undertaken,  other than investigations pursuant to Paragraph 4.7.1.  If extraordinary circumstances are present, Air Force commands and components may formally request an exception to the provisions in DoDI 4715.08, through the GCC and from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology  and  Logistics  (USD(AT&L)).    Such  requests  are  forwarded  through  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health (ASD(EI&E)) and to USD(AT&L). (T-0). 4.4.7.  Air  Force  commands  and  components  will  perform  no  remediation  efforts  when  the use  of  the  claims  process  has  been  determined  by  the  ITAFHQ,  after  consultation  with ITAFHQ  legal  staff,  as  the  most  appropriate  solution  to  support  Air  Force  overseas operations.    “Ex  gratia”  claim  efforts  require  special  procedures  IAW  Section  321  of  US Public Law 105-261, concerning national defense authorizations. (T-0). 4.4.8.  No  remediation  of  environmental  contamination  is  performed  at  an  Air  Force installation that has been determined by OSD to have operations terminated and be returned to the HN, except such measures as required IAW DoDI 4715.08, to prevent exposure of US forces  and  personnel  to  contamination  that  poses  an  SIHS  or  are  required  by  an  applicable IA.  Such  measures  will  not  extend  beyond  the  date  when  DoD/Air  Force  operations  are terminated at the installation or unless required by an applicable IA. (T-0). 4.4.9.  No investigations or remediation of environmental contamination will be performed at a location that was once controlled or used by the Air Force but has been returned to the host nation unless required by applicable IA. 4.4.10.  Remediation will not be performed for symbolic purposes. (T-0). 4.5.  Authorities. 4.5.1.  For  remediation  issues  subject  to  DoDI  4715.08,  Commander  of  United  States  Air Forces  in  Europe  (USAFE/CC)  is  the  ITAFHQ  Commander  in  the  United  States  European Command  (EUCOM)  and  United  States  Africa  Command  (AFRICOM)  AORs.      For AFI32-7091  18 MARCH 2016 27 Greenland and Ascension Island, Commander of Air Force Space Command (AFSPC/CC) is the  ITAFHQ  Commander  and  makes  SIHS  determinations  after  coordination  with Headquarters United States Air Forces in Europe (HQ USAFE). 4.5.2.  For  remediation  issues  subject  to  DoDI  4715.08,  Commander  of  Pacific  Air  Forces (PACAF/CC) is the ITAFHQ Commander in the United States Pacific Command (PACOM) AOR,  and  Commander  of  Air  Forces  Central  Command  (AFCENT/CC)  is  the  ITAFHQ Commander in the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) AOR.  Commander of Air Forces Southern Command (AFSOUTH/CC) is the ITAFHQ Commander in the United States  Southern  Command  (USSOUTHCOM)  AOR.   For  remediation  in  Antigua, Commander  of  Air  Force  Space  Command  (AFSPC/CC)  is  the  ITAFHQ  Commander  and makes SIHS determinations after coordination with AFSOUTH. 4.5.3.  The responsible ITAFHQ/CC (see Paragraphs 4.5.1 and 4.5.2) ensures procedures are in place IAW this chapter to determine if environmental contamination poses an SIHS.  The ITAFHQ/CC  makes  SIHS  determinations  after  consultation  with  the  appropriate  DoD medical authority and LEC, if any. 4.5.3.1.  The  "appropriate  DoD  medical  authority  and  health  evaluation  authority" described in DoDI 4715.08 is the ITAFHQ Surgeon General (SG) or SG-designee.  The ITAFHQ  SG  or  SG-designee  can  delegate  the  authority  as  needed.    However,  such delegation  must  be  to  an  individual  or  office  qualified  to  evaluate  the  levels  of contamination  present  at  a  location  and  whether  the  exposure  of  such  contamination results in an SIHS. 4.5.3.2.  The  ITAFHQ/CC  may  delegate  authority  to  make  SIHS  determinations  to  a subordinate general-level officer in writing.  Further re-delegation is not authorized.  Any re-delegation is subject to the consultation requirements of Paragraph 4.5.3. 4.6.  Environmental  Liability  (EL).  US  DoD  environmental  liabilities  overseas  depend  on legal  circumstances  and  must  be  determined  by  the  responsible  ITAFHQ  legal  function  in consultation  with  the  LEC,  if  any,  and  GCC  legal  advisors.    Per  DoD  7000.14-R,  Financial Management  Regulations  (FMR),  Volume  4,  Chapter  13,  Environmental  Liabilities,  overseas ELs  are  defined  as:  environmental  cleanup,  closure,  and/or  disposal  costs  associated  with  the operation  of  installations  overseas  IAW  DoDI  4715.08  and  applicable  IAs  defined  by  DoD Directive  5530.3.  Environmental  liabilities  resulting  from  DoD  operations  are  considered “Government-Related  Events,”  defined  by  the  Statement  of  Federal  Financial  Accounting Standards  Number  5,  "Accounting  for  Liabilities  of  the  Federal  Government,"  and  will  be recognized when the event creating the liability occurs. 4.7.  Procedures  for  Remediation  of  Environmental  Contamination.  This  section  describes the  investigation  and  remedial  action  processes  required  IAW  DoDI  4715.08,  Enclosure  3,  to include  key  documentation  requirements.    These  processes  and  requirements  are  subject  to change based upon GCC and LEC remediation policy issued to implement and supplement DoDI 4715.08.    Consult  with  the  appropriate  IEF  for  guidance  on  how  GCC  and  LEC  policy  may affect the requirements of this chapter.  Figure 4.1 outlines the authorized routes and procedures for validation of remediation requirements at enduring installations overseas. 28 AFI32-7091  18 MARCH 2016 Figure 4.1.  Overseas Environmental Remediation Justification Routes and Procedures. 4.7.1.  Actual and Reasonable Likelihood of SIHS Contamination.  4.7.1.1.  IAW  DoDI  4715.08,  the  installation  shall  take  prompt  action  to  address environmental contamination resulting from past or present  Air Force or other US DoD Component activities on-installation that pose an SIHS. (T-0). 4.7.1.2.  When the Air Force is aware that there is a reasonable likelihood of SIHS  as a result  of  environmental  contamination  on  an  Air  Force  installation,  DoDI  4715.08 authorizes  further  action  to  determine  if  the  contamination  poses  an  SIHS.    Installation staff,  in  conjunction  with  the  IEF,  AFCEC/CZ  and  AFMSA/SG3PB,  must  substantiate when a reasonable likelihood of an SIHS exists. (T-0). 4.7.1.3.  SIHS  Determination.    The  ITAFHQ/CC  makes  SIHS  determinations  only  after consultation  with  the  appropriate  DoD  medical  authority  and  LEC,  if  any.    The ITAFHQ/CC  will  decide  either  that  an  SIHS  exists  or  that  no  SIHS  exists.  (T-0).  If  no SIHS  exists,  further  remediation  action  is  not  justified.    The  SIHS  decision  must  be documented in writing and must be supported by a health impact assessment (HIA) (i.e., health “risk” assessment) that complies with Paragraph 4.7.1.6 of this chapter. (T-0).  The SIHS  process  correlates  to  the  AF  Occupational  and  Environmental  Health  Site Assessment (OEHSA) process as defined in AFTTP 3-2.82. AFI32-7091  18 MARCH 2016 29 4.7.1.4.  Once  concurrence  is  obtained  that  a  reasonable  likelihood  of  SIHS  exists,  the DoD  health  evaluation  authority  shall  create  an  Investigation  Plan  (IvP)  to  enable confirmation of SIHS. (T-0). The appropriate DoD medical authority may authorize the installation BE, supporting IEF, or AFCEC/CZ to prepare the IvP. The IvP correlates to the planning activities in Phase I of the OEHSA (Chapter 2, AFTTP 3-2.82). 4.7.1.5.  Site Investigation (SI).  The SI will be conducted based on the IvP scope. (T-0).  The  SI  is  focused  and  limited  to  the  specific  evidence  or  allegation  that  an  SIHS  is present  at  a  particular  location.    Thus,  it  will  be performed  in  stages;  the  need  for  each additional stage of investigation must be supported by the results of the prior stage(s) and will  be  based  on  accepted  science  (i.e.,  state-of-the-art)  and  accredited  laboratory sampling procedures. Other than a “de  minimis” amount, investigation measures will not include  actual  removal  of  the  contamination  itself,  but  may  require  “risk  management” measures  such  as  temporary  access  barriers  to  avoid  immediate  human  health  threats (e.g., air exposure).  The SI correlates to the activities conducted in  Phases II and III of the  OEHSA  (Chapters  3-4,  AFTTP  3-2.82).    These  activities  may  include,  but  are  not limited  to:  site  interviews  and  reconnaissance,  completion  of  conceptual  site  model, screening of exposure points, ranking of hazards, and additional data collection. 4.7.1.6.  Health  Impact  Assessment  (HIA).  The HIA is  a scientific-based human health risk  assessment,  evaluating  whether  or  not  environmental  contamination  present  at  a location  poses  an  SIHS.    The  HIA  will  be  performed  by  or  with  the  approval  of  the appropriate DoD medical authority specified in paragraph 4.5.3.1. (T-0).  The appropriate DoD  medical  authority  may  authorize  the  installation  BE,  the  supporting  IEF,  or  a certified health risk assessor to  perform  the HIA.  The HIA correlates to the OEH Risk Assessment conducted in Phase IV of the OEHSA (Chapter 5, AFTTP 3-2.82). 4.7.2.  IA.    IAW  DoDI  4715.08,  Air  Force  commands  and  components  must  comply  with applicable  IA  requirements  to  remediate  environmental  contamination.  (T-0).    The ITAFHQ/CC or delegated general  officer determines remediation required by an applicable IA agreement after consulting with the LEC, if any, and after obtaining a legal determination from  the  ITAFHQ  or  HHQ  legal  office,  that  the  requirement  for  such  remediation  is mandatory  and  arises  from  a  binding  IA  to  which  the  United  States  is  a  party.  (T-0).    IA determination shall be made in writing and retained IAW Section 4.8.  (T-1). 4.7.3.  Extraordinary  Circumstances.    Approval  to  remediate  based  on  extraordinary circumstances is governed by DoDI 4715.08.  Such extraordinary circumstances requests will be  developed  in  coordination  with  the  appropriate  IEF,  ITAFHQ,  and  LEC  for  submission through  the  operational  chain  of  command  to  the  GCC,  Joint  Staff,  ASD(EI&E),  and USD(AT&L). (T-0). 4.7.4.  Remedial Action and Closure. 4.7.4.1.  Commanders will use their discretion, in consulting with the installation BE (or SG-designee), IEF or legal office, as appropriate, and the LEC, to make decisions on how to  perform  actions  necessary  to  address  remediation  of  contamination,  ranging  from institutional  responses,  such  as  restricting  access  or  stopping  use,  to  more  extensive remedies. (T-1). 30 AFI32-7091  18 MARCH 2016 4.7.4.2.  Remedial  actions  are  considered  complete  when the  environmental contamination no longer poses an SIHS or the action(s) fulfill Air Force requirements and obligations of the binding IA. (T-1). 4.8.  Additional  Documentation  Requirements.  All  site  documentation  will  be  kept  until  10 years  after  the  installation  is  returned  to  the  HN  and  all  claims  or  other  issues  about contamination  are  resolved.    Ensure  disposition  is  current  with  disposition  located  in  the  Air Force Records Disposition Schedule. (T-1).  All site specific records will be maintained by base CE in a Site Audit File. 4.8.1.  Site  Identification.    Once  a  potential  contaminated  site  is  identified,  the  installation will complete a site identification checklist and submit for concurrence. (T-1). 4.8.2.  Site  Inventory.    The  installation  will  maintain  a  contaminated  site  inventory differentiating  between  potential  and  validated  Air  Force,  other  DoD  Component,  HN  or other third party contaminated sites. (T-1). 4.8.3.  Site  Validation.    Once  all  required  concurrences,  determinations,  approvals  and/or exception requests are obtained, the installation will complete a site validation checklist and submit for concurrence. (T-1). 4.8.4.  Cost  Documentation.    The  installation  will  complete  and  maintain  supporting  cost documentation and a cost estimate basis, to include data sources and assumptions needed to validate the cost estimate basis, for each project requirement associated with a contaminated site. (T-1). 4.8.4.1.  Additionally,  the  installation  shall  ensure  that  annual  cost-to-complete  (CTC) estimates  are  prepared  and  documented  for  each  site  in  the  installation’s  site  inventory. (T-1). 4.8.4.2.  These  estimates  are  updated,  as  required,  based  on  current  project  information and  schedules  IAW  this  guidance,  other  applicable  guidance  and  policies,  and  DoD 7000.14-R,  FMR.    The  installation  shall  ensure  that  the  CTC  estimates  are  reliable, reproducible, and auditable. (T-1). 4.8.4.3.  An estimate is only prepared when sufficient site-specific data exists to make a “reasonable” estimate without making unsubstantiated assumptions. 4.8.5.  Remedial  Action  and  Management.    The  installation  will  maintain  all  site  project solicitation packages, contracts, invoices and de-obligation request forms. (T-1). 4.8.6.  Remediation  Completion  Report.    The  installation  will  complete  a  remediation completion  report  detailing  the  extent  of  actions  taken  or  to  be  taken,  additional  follow-on monitoring  and  analysis,  cost  of  the  remediation,  and  any  negotiated  conditions.  (T-1).  Additionally,  if  applicable,  regulatory  authority  closure  approval  will  be  documented  and included in the completion report.  This report will be provided to the LEC, if any, and the GCC. (T-1). 4.8.7.  Site  Audit  File.    The  installation  shall  maintain  documentation  for  each  site,  to include,  as  required:  all  concurrences,  determinations,  approvals  and/or  exception  requests obtained;  the  IvP  (including  investigation  reports),  HIA  and  SIHS  determinations;  site identification  and  validation  checklists;  supporting  cost  documentation  and  CTC  balance sheets; and remediation completion reports. (T-1). AFI32-7091  18 MARCH 2016 31 4.8.8.  Subject  to  security  requirements  and  applicable  IAs,  Air  Force  remediation documentation  may  be  provided  to  the  HN,  upon  their  request,  consistent  with  applicable LEC procedures. 4.9.  Consultations  with  HN  Authorities.  Consultations  with  the  HN  regarding  any  matter covered  by  this  chapter  will  be  conducted  IAW  DoDI  4715.08,  DoDD  5530.3.,  and  other applicable DoD and Air Force issuances. (T-0). 4.10.  Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) of Funds.  Remediation of environmental  contamination  authorized  by  this  instruction  will  be  funded  in  the  current  or following  fiscal  year  for  current  exposure.  (T-1).    Additionally,  programming  in  ACES  is authorized and will be validated for exposure about to occur within the next 3 to 5 years and for identifying  presumptive  remedies  as  detailed  in  the  cost  documentation  prepared  IAW  with Paragraph 4.8.4 of this instruction. (T-1).  See Chapter 1, Section 1.7 for more PPBE guidance. 32 AFI32-7091  18 MARCH 2016 Chapter 5 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS PROCESS (EIAP) 5.1.  Scope.  The  Environmental  Impact  Analysis  Process  (EIAP)  applies  to  Air  Force  actions impacting the environment outside the United States.  E.O. 12114, provides the requirements for taking  account  of  considerations  with  respect  to  actions  that  do  significant  harm  to  the environment  of  places  outside  the  United  States  and  is  implemented  within  DoD  by  Title  32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 187 (32 C.F.R.  § 187) which provides policy to enable DoD officials to be informed and take account of environmental considerations prior to authorizing or approving certain major Federal actions.  See 32 C.F.R. §§ 989.3(d) & (e); 989.37; and 989.38. 5.2.  Applicability.  This  chapter  implements  and  supplements  32  C.F.R.  187,  Environmental Effects  Abroad of  Major  Department of Defense  Actions, and Title 32, C.F.R., §§ 187, 989.37, and 989.38 (32 C.F.R. § 187, 32 C.F.R. §§ 989.37, and 989.38).  It applies to all proposed Air Force actions that have the potential to significantly harm the environment of areas outside the United  States,  to  include  foreign  countries  and  the  global  commons,  or  to  significantly  harm protected global resources. 5.3.  Background.  The  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA)  (Title  42,  U.S.C.,  4321-4370h) does not directly apply overseas; however, E.O. 12114, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions, does directly apply.  32 C.F.R. § 187 implements and supplements E.O. 12114.  E.O. 12114 and 32 C.F.R. § 187 prescribe procedural measures and other actions to be taken by DoD Components to further the purpose of the NEPA with respect to the environment outside the United States. 5.4.  Overseas  EIAP  Policy  and  Requirements.  For  operations  under  Air  Force  jurisdiction, Proponents  that  initiate  action  overseas  will  work  with  the  EPF  to  comply  with  the  EIAP  and prepare decision documents as generally discussed in Section 5.5 of this instruction. (T-1). 5.4.1.  The Proponent of an action is supported by the EPF and an interdisciplinary team to provide security and policy oversight and review. 5.4.2.  AF  Form  813,  Request  for  Environmental  Impact  Analysis.    The  Air  Force  will  use the  AF  Form  AF  Form  813  to  record  the  request  for  EIAP  for  proposed  actions  overseas.  The Proponent  will submit  all overseas Proponent  action proposals  on the AF  Form  813 to the  appropriate  EPF  as  early  as  possible  to  initiate  the  EIAP  and  secure  authorization  and implementation for the Proponents’ desired action. Timely completion of the requisite EIAP document is directly related to the quality of Proponent's action proposal submittal in Section 1  of  the  AF  Form  813.    For  additional  guidance,  see  the  Overseas  EIAP  on  the  AFCEC eDASH website at https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/nepa/SiteAssets/Overseas%20EIAP.aspx. 5.4.3.  As a general rule, a proposed action will not be implemented until the requirements of Sections 5.5 and 5.6 and the coordination requirements of Sections 5.7 and 5.8 of this chapter are accomplished. (T-0).  Prepare IAW 32 C.F.R. § 187, Section E1.D. 5.5.  Environmental  Effects  Documents  for  Overseas  EIAP.  There  are  four  environmental effects  documents  that  are  to  be  used  for  overseas  EIAP:    1)  Environmental  Review  (ER);  2) Environmental  Study  (ES);  3)  Overseas  Environmental  Assessment  (OEA);  and  4)  Overseas Environmental Impact Statement (OEIS). (T-0). AFI32-7091  18 MARCH 2016 33 5.5.1.  For major federal actions determined, IAW 32 C.F.R. § 187, to do significant harm to the environment of a foreign country or to a protected global resource, the installation shall prepare either an ER or an ES.  For major federal actions that will do significant harm to the environment of the global commons, the installation shall prepare an OEIS. (T-0).  However, an  OEA  may  be  prepared  first  to  determine  whether  or  not  an  OEIS  is  required  for  a particular action. 5.5.1.1.  Environmental  Review  (ER).    An  ER  is  a  concise  survey  of  the  important environmental issues associated with a major federal action overseas to be considered by appropriate  Air  Force  Proponent  during  the  decision-making  process.    The  ER  is prepared  by  the  Air  Force  either  unilaterally,  or  in  conjunction  with  another  US Government agency.  Prepare in accordance 32 C.F.R. § 187, E2.C and E2.E.. (T-0). 5.5.1.2.  Environmental  Study  (ES).    An  ES  is  an  analysis  of  the  likely  environmental consequences  of  the  action  that  is  to  be  considered  by  appropriate  Air  Force  leadership during  the  decision-making  process.    An  ES  is  a  cooperative  action,  not  a  unilateral action, taken by the Air Force.  It is prepared by the Air Force in conjunction with one or more  foreign  nations,  or  by  an  international  body  or  organization  of  which  the  United States is a member or participant. Prepare in accordance with 32 C.F.R. § 187, E2.C and E2.D. (T-0). 5.5.1.3.  Overseas  Environmental  Assessment  (OEA).    An  OEA  is  a  brief  and  concise statement  that  provides  sufficient  information  to  enable  Air  Force  Proponent  to  decide whether  or  not  the  proposed  action  is  a  major  action,  is  a  federal  action,  and  will significantly harm the environment of the global commons. See 32 C.F.R. § 187, E1.C.9. 5.5.1.3.1.  The OEA is prepared by the Air Force unilaterally, and at a minimum, will describe the proposed action, state the need for the proposed action, and discuss the anticipated  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action.  (T-0).  A  Finding  of  No Significant Harm (FONSH) may be issued if no OEIS is required. 5.5.1.4.  Overseas Environmental  Impact  Statement  (OEIS).  An OEIS is  a statement of the  environmental  effects  of  a  proposed  action  on  the  global  commons  and  reasonable alternatives.  The OEIS is prepared by the Air Force unilaterally or jointly with another US  federal  agency that  is  involved in the action.  The OEIS will enable the appropriate decision-maker to be informed of pertinent environmental considerations prior to issuing their formal Overseas Record of Decision (OROD). Prepare in accordance with 32 C.F.R. § 187, E1.D. (T-O). 5.5.1.5.  The  EPF  supports  the  Proponent  in  preparing  and  coordinating  the  OEIS  IAW 32 C.F.R. § 187, E1.D, and 32 C.F.R. § 989.38. (T-0). 5.5.1.5.1.  The EPF supports the Proponent in staffing copies of the preliminary draft OEIS  to  HQ  USAF/A4CI  to  obtain  HQ  USAF  Environmental,  Safety  and Occupational  Health  Council  (ESOHC)  review  and  AFCEC/CZ  SME  for  technical review. (T-1). 5.6.  Coordination,  Release  and  Maintenance  of  Overseas  Environmental  Effects Documents.  The  EPF  will  help  the  Proponent  coordinate  overseas  environmental  effects documents  with  the  ITAFHQ  if  the  ITAFHQ  is  not  the  Proponent's  assigned  Numbered  Air Force  (NAF)  or  major  command.  (T-1).    In  addition,  the  EPF  will  assist  the  Proponent 34 AFI32-7091  18 MARCH 2016 coordinate  environmental  effects  documents  with  non-Air  Force  in-theater  DoD  Component headquarters  (e.g.,  HQ  US  Army  in  Europe,  HQ  US  Naval  Forces  Japan)  and  LECs  when required or  appropriate.  (T-0).    The Proponent  and EPF may  accomplish coordination with  the ITAFHQ through the appropriate IEF. 5.6.1.  IAW  32  C.F.R.  §  989.38,  AF/A4CI  is  responsible,  when  appropriate,  for  obtaining coordination on ERs and ESs from appropriate US federal agencies.  For EISs, AF/A4CI is responsible  for  obtaining  HQ  USAF  ESOHC  review.    In  addition,  AF/A4CI  is  responsible for making  final  ERs  and ESs available to  the  DOS,  the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ),  other  interested  US  federal  agencies,  and,  on  request,  to  the  public  in  the  United States.  Subject to limitations specified in 32C.F.R. § 187, E2.5.6, and controls on classified information,  AF/A4CI  may  inform  interested  foreign  governments  about  ESs  or  provide copies of ESs to HNGAs. (T-1). 5.6.2.  There  is  no  requirement  to  distribute  draft  OEAs  for  public  comment,  but  AF/A4CI will make final OEAs available to the public in  the United States upon request.  The DOS, the  CEQ,  and  other  interested  US  federal  agencies  will  be  informed  of  the  availability  of draft OEISs and will be given the opportunity to comment.  AF/A4CI will make final OEISs available to the public in the United States.  Interested foreign governments may be informed of the availability of OEIS IAW Section 5.8 of this chapter. (T-0). 5.6.3.  Maintenance.    The  installation  or  AFCEC/CZ  will  provide  an  electronic  copy  (e.g., portable  document  format,  Word  format)  of  each  final  ER,  ES,  OEA  and  OEIS  to AFCEC/CZN for the EIAP repository. (T-3). 5.7.  Exemptions and Exclusions.  Several types of actions can be exempt or excluded from the requirements specified in Sections 5.5 and 5.6 of this chapter. 5.7.1.  General  exemptions.    E.O.  12114  and  32  C.F.R.  §  187  specify  several  general exemptions that apply to proposed actions that will do significant harm to the environment of a foreign country or to a protected global resource.  They include: 5.7.1.1.  Actions  that  the  Air  Force  determines  do  not  do  significant  harm  to  the environment overseas or to a designated global resource; 5.7.1.2.  Actions taken pursuant to the direction of the President or Secretary of Defense in  the  course  of  armed  conflict  or  when  national  security  or  national  interests  are involved; 5.7.1.3.  Disaster and emergency relief actions; 5.7.1.4.  Other general actions and requirements as specified in E2.C.3.a. of 32 C.F.R. § 187. 5.7.2.  Exemptions  unique  to  DoD  and  the  Air  Force.    The  DoD  is  authorized  under  E.O. 12114 to establish additional exemptions that apply only to the Department’s operations.  In 32 C.F.R. § 187, DoD addresses two types of additional exemptions for actions that  will do significant harm to the environment of a foreign country or to a protected global resource. 5.7.2.1.  Case-by-case.    Exemptions  other  than  those  specified  above  may  be  required because  of  emergencies,  national  security  considerations,  exceptional  foreign  policy requirements,  or  other  special  circumstances  preclude  or  are  inconsistent  with  the preparation  of  EIAP  documentation  and  taking  of  other  actions  prescribed  by  this AFI32-7091  18 MARCH 2016 35 chapter.  See E2.C.3.b.1 of 32 C.F.R. § 187 for more information regarding case-by-case exemptions. 5.7.2.2.  Class.    Circumstances  may  exist  where  a  class  exemption  for  a  “group”  of related  actions  is  more  appropriate  than  a  specific  exemption.    See  E2.C.3.b.2  of  32 C.F.R. § 187 for more information regarding class exemptions. 5.7.3.  Overseas Categorical Exclusion (OCATEX).  Per 32 C.F.R. § 187, DoD may approve categorical  exclusions  for  actions  that  normally  do  not,  individually  or  cumulatively,  do significant harm to the environment.  To date, there are no approved Air Force OCATEXes. 5.8.  Interaction with HNGAs and the DOS. 5.8.1.  Proponents  will  ensure  interactions  with  HNGAs  on  overseas  EIAP  matters  comply with  applicable  MAJCOM,  LEC,  and  GCC  policies.  (T-0).    Communication  regarding  IAs and other formal arrangements with host nations concerning environmental matters must be coordinated  with  the  DOS  and  the  appropriate  unified  command.    Informal,  working-level communications  and  arrangements  do  not  require  DOS  coordination  but  must  still  comply with appropriate staffing policies. (T-0). 5.8.2.  The Proponent and the EPF will not interact with HNGAs regarding matters covered in  this  chapter  without  first  consulting  the  appropriate  IEF  and  ITAFHQ  legal  office  for specific  guidance  on  HNGA  coordination  requirements.  (T-1).    When  DOS  coordination  is required or desired, the  IEF and  ITAFHQ legal  office will assist  the Proponent  and EPF to obtain  the  coordination  through  AF/A4CI,  SAF/IEE,  ASD(EI&E)  and  other  Air  Force  and DoD offices as appropriate.  However,  IAW 32 C.F.R. § 989.38, AF/A4CI makes ERs  and ESs available to DOS for comment; unless it authorizes the ITAFHQ, IEF, or other entity, as appropriate, to make the documents available to DOS. 5.9.  Classified Action Proposals.  OEAs, OEISs, ERs, and ESs that address classified proposals will  be  safeguarded  and  classified  information  will  be  handled  IAW  32  C.F.R.  §  989.26  and restricted  from  public  dissemination  IAW  DoDI  5200.01,  DoD  Information  Security  Program and  Protection  of  Sensitive  Compartmented  Information,  AFI  16-1404,  Air  Force  Information Security  Program,  and  DoD5400.7-R_AFMAN  33-302,  Freedom  of  Information  Act  Program. (T-0).    Only  unclassified  portions  of  environmental  effects  documents  may  be  released  to  the public. 5.9.1.  IAW CJCSI 2300.02H, Coordination of Overseas Force Structure Changes and Host-Nation Notification, regarding overseas force structure changes, the proposed action location is  classified  until  after  the  host  nation  notification  process  is  complete.    In  practice,  this means  that  any  EIAP  documents  prepared  before  HNN  are  complete  will  necessarily  be classified  even  if  only  because  they  indicate  the  proposed  location  of  the  action.    Related EIAP documents will need to be classified until after completion of HNN, at which time they can be declassified, by competent authority. (T-0).  JOHN B.
