(N/A for DRUs). 1.2.9.  Crew members. 1.2.9.1.  Know  and  complete  training  requirements  and  currencies  IAW  Chapter  4  of this volume, unit supplements for DRUs, and applicable RTM. 1.2.9.2.  Not  participate  in  activities/events  for  which  they  are  not  trained,  qualified,  or certified, or current unless under appropriate supervision. 1.2.9.3.  Complete  a  GEQ  within  6  months  following  completion  of  IQT  IAW ACC/TRSS  Det  9  guidance/policy.    Notify  flight  commander  or  supervisor  and Directorate of Operations Training (DOT) when this GEQ has been completed/submitted.  (N/A for DRUs). 1.3.  Training.  Operations  training  is  designed  to  progress  crew  members  from  IQT  (Basic Course  or  Requalification  Training)  through  MQT,  and  finally  to  CT,  as  applicable.    A qualification  is  awarded  to  each  individual  upon  the  successful  completion  of  IQT/  MQT  or Requalification Training (RQT).  Personnel can be qualified: BQ, BMC, and CMR.   1.3.1.  IQT  (Chapter  2)  provides  the  training  necessary  to  initially  qualify  individuals  to perform  specific duties/tasks  on specific  equipment  and/or in  a basic crew position without regard to the unit’s mission.  Upon completion of IQT, individuals attain a BQ status.  1.3.1.1.  BQ individuals have completed an evaluation and are qualified to perform basic crew  positional  duties.    The  Squadron  CC  determines  those  missions  that  BQ  crew members may perform unsupervised. 1.3.1.1.1.  DRU BQ crew members are fully qualified in the unique mission that their unit performs. 1.3.1.2.  BQ is a prerequisite for MQT. 1.3.2.  MQT (Chapter 3) provides crew members the advanced training necessary to qualify in an assigned crew position.  Crew members maintain BQ status until completion of MQT.  MQT  is  not  required  for  attached  Wing  personnel,  Group,  752  OSS,  133  TS,  or  DRU personnel unless required by unit leadership (paragraph  3.1.2).  Upon completion of MQT and associated Stan/Eval requirements IAW AFI13-1 CRC Vol. 2 individuals are designated BMC/CMR. 1.3.3.  BMC/CMR.  BMC  and  CMR  training  requirements  and  currencies  are  outlined  in Chapter 4 or the RTM. 1.3.3.1.  BMC.  BMC designated crew members have primary jobs or staff functions that directly  support  the  MDS  mission.    BMC  status  entails  accomplishing  the  minimum training requirements for crew members to remain familiar with all mission areas, and to be qualified and proficient in some of the primary missions tasked for their assigned duty 12 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 position.  BMC crew members must be able to attain CMR status in 30 days or less. (T-3). 1.3.3.1.1.  Personnel  assigned  to  MAJCOM,  NAF,  Group,  752  OSS,  or  133  TS maintain BMC status. 1.3.3.2.  CMR.  CMR  crew  members  maintain  currency  and  proficiency  in  all  core missions  of  the  unit  to  which  they  are  assigned.    CMR  entails  accomplishing  the minimum required training requirements for crew members to be qualified and proficient in all of the primary missions tasked for their duty position. 1.3.4.  CT  (Chapter  4)  provides  crew  members  with  the  volume,  frequency,  and  mix  of training  necessary  to  maintain  proficiency  in  the  assigned  qualification/certification  level.  RAP  is  the  combat  coded/DOC-tasked  unit  CT  program  designed  to  focus  training  toward needed combat/contingency skills.  A crew member’s training cycle (CT/RAP) requirements are based on the crew member’s current experienced or inexperienced status.  When a crew member  changes  experience  levels,  training  requirements  will  be  prorated  from  the  date  of experience  change.  (T-3).    Specific  RAP  requirements  are  issued  by  MAJCOMs  via  the RTM.   ACC/A3CG  (USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3CO  for  USAFE-1.3.5.  Attached  Personnel. AFAFRICA  units  or  PACAF/A8X  for  PACAF  units)  are  to  determine  attached  personnel requirements  for  personnel  assigned  at  or  above  Wing  level.    Attached  crew  members  will have a valid AF  Form  8,  Certificate of Aircrew  Qualification,  IAW AFI  13-1STAN/EVAL Vol.  2.  (T-2).    Attached  personnel  maintain  proficiency  and  qualification/certification  in some of the unit core missions.   1.3.5.1.  Attached  CRC  crew  members  are  BMC  and  not  required  to  maintain  CT lookback requirements IAW paragraph  4.7.2 1.3.5.2.  Current/qualified  attached  CRC  BMC  crew  members  may  work  without  an instructor with the following exception:  the unit DO will approve utilization of attached CRC BMC crew members for large force employment exercises. (T-3). 1.3.5.3.  Attached  CRC  BMC  crew  members  are  exempt  from  academic  training  and/or special  training  programs  except  where  specifically  directed  by  the  host  squadron commander. 1.3.6.  Unqualified    (UQ).  Unqualified  crew  members  require  a  mission  evaluation  before progressing to a higher qualification level.  UQ crew members fall under one or more of the following categories: 1.3.6.1.  Downgraded  for  being  Non-Current  (Non-Combat  Mission  Ready,  Non  Basic Mission Capable (NCMR/NBMC)) longer than 180 days. 1.3.6.2.  Downgraded for a demonstrated lack of ability. 1.3.6.3.  Downgraded  for  failure  to  meet  standards  during  a  periodic  evaluation  or  at Commander  discretion  following  a  Commander-directed  downgrade  IAW  AFI  13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2. 1.3.7.  Crew  member  Experience  Level.   Crew member  experience levels  are designed to indicate  to  unit  commanders  how  much  training  crew  members  need  to  maintain  CT/RAP AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 13 requirements  and  therefore  proficiency.    Crew  members  will  be  either  “Inexperienced”  or “Experienced.”  (T-3).    DRUs  will  identify  their  equivalent/unique  experience  level requirements in their unit supplement. (T-2).  Squadron Directorate of Operations, Training (DOT) offices will document the crew member’s status IAW Chapter 7. (T-2).   1.3.7.1.  An  experienced  Senior  Director/Air  Weapons  Officer/Weapons  Director (SD/AWO/WD) will: 1.3.7.1.1.  Have been formally awarded a 13BXX/1C5X1D AFSC. (T-2). 1.3.7.1.2.

Have performed in that particular position, as CMR/BMC at a CRC, for a period  of  6  months  which  must  consist  of  a  minimum  of  3  months  on  the  unit’s assigned system of record. (T-3). 1.3.7.2.4.  Have  at  least  50  career  event  operations  (see  tables  in  Chapter  4) performing duties in a CMR/BMC status, of which 12 must be on the unit’s assigned system  of  record  (live/virtual/constructive  with  at  least  50%  live/virtual)  event operations. (T-3). 1.3.7.3.  An  experienced  Mission  Crew  Commander  (MCC)  performs  as  a  CMR/BMC MCC  for  a  period  of  6  months  which  must  consist  of  a  minimum  of  3  months  on  the unit’s assigned system of record. (T-3). 1.3.8.  Upgrade/Specialized Training (Chapter 5).  Upgrade/Specialized training is training in any special skills necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned mission that is not required by every  crew  member.    Upgrade/Specialized  training  is  normally  accomplished  after  a  crew member  is  assigned  CMR/BMC  status  and  is  normally  in  addition  to  CMR/BMC requirements.    Unless  otherwise  specified,  CMR/BMC  crew  members  may  hold  special certifications  as  long  as  all  training  requirements,  as  applicable,  are  accomplished.    Note:  BSCs are certified and are not required to maintain another qualification.  DSTs are certified, however they must hold a qualification in another position. (T-2). 14 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 1.3.8.1.  Instructor/evaluator crew members are trained to instruct and/or evaluate duties associated  within  their  crew  positions.    Instructor/evaluator  crew  members  maintain CMR/BMC  status.    Instructors  may  perform  instructor  duties  as  long  as  they  are CMR/BMC, have a current  instructor qualification and are current  in  the event  they are instructing.    Instructors/evaluators  who  become  NCMR/NBMC  may  be  allowed  to continue academic and/or crew training device instructor duties with Group Commander approval.  ANG units and DRUs will request approval from ACC/A3C. (T-2).  USAFE-AFAFRICA units will request approval from USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3C. (T-2). 1.4.  Training Concepts and Policies. 1.4.1.  Training  programs  are  designed  to  achieve  the  highest  degree  of  combat  readiness consistent with flight safety and resource availability.  Training balances the need for realism against  the  expected  threat,  crew  capabilities,  and  safety.    This  volume  provides  training guidelines and policies to be used with  operational  procedures specified in  other applicable flying/operations publications. 1.4.2.  Air  Control  Squadron  (ACS)  Commanders  and  Director  of  Operations  will  have  or obtain  the  13B3D  AFSC  (Non-waiverable).    CRC  Commanders  and  DOs  will  maintain  a CRC MCC qualification. (T-2).  (See Chapter 6 for additional ACC-gained unit guidance). 1.4.3.  Training  missions  are  designed  to  successfully  achieve/accomplish  unit  tasked missions, roles/capabilities, maintain proficiency, as well as to enhance safety.  RAP training missions are to emphasize combat/contingency skills through missions/scenarios that reflect procedures  and  operations  based  on  employment  plans,  locations,  current  intelligence,  and opposition  capabilities.    Units  are  to  train  using  procedures  and  actions  applicable  to combat/contingency scenarios (e.g. appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, intelligence briefings and debriefings).   1.4.3.1.  DRU  training  missions  are  to  emphasize  skills  through  missions/scenarios  that reflect procedures and operations based on the unit’s tasked mission.   1.4.4.  Crew  member  Supervision.    The  following  personnel  must  be  under  the  direct supervision  of  an  instructor/evaluator  when  performing  mission  positional  duties/tasks.  (T-3). 1.4.4.1.  Unqualified crew members. 1.4.4.2.  Crew members performing events in which they are non-current, unqualified or not certified. 1.4.4.3.

Personnel  going permanent  change of station (PCS) or TDY to  a unit with  the same system of record may be continued in their previous training phase/qualification/certification, following local orientation and selected training, if applicable.  The completion date and test scores of written local area procedures examinations are documented IAW Chapter 7. (T-3). 1.5.  Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Policy and Management. 1.5.1.  The  RTM  when  published,  takes  precedence  over  this  volume  and  may  contain updated definitions and requirements not incorporated in this volume.  The RTM is reviewed by  the  MAJCOM  throughout  the  training  cycle.    In  the  absence  of  an  RTM  and  for  non-combat coded units, crew members/individuals accomplish the CT requirements outlined in Chapter 4. 1.5.2.  Qualification/experience  levels  are  defined  by  a  total  number  of  RAP  events  and broken down into event types (Chapter 4). 1.5.3.  Progression from BMC to CMR requires: 1.5.3.1.  Lookback at CMR mission/event rate. 16 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 1.5.3.2.  Squadron commander certification. 1.5.4.  Crew  members  will  maintain  currency  (see  Table  4.10  through  Table  4.16)  and accomplish  3-month  required  lookback.  (T-3).    Lookback  requirements  are  described  in paragraph 4.7.2. 1.6.  Training Program Development. 1.6.1.  This volume and the RTM mission and event requirements apply to all crew members.  The standard mission requirements listed in this volume and the RTM establish the minimum number of missions/events per training cycle for BMC and CMR personnel.  The RTM does not apply to the DRUs. 1.7.  Training  Records  and  Reports.  Units  will  maintain  individual  crew  member  training records  IAW  AFI  33-360,  AFI  11-401,  AFMAN  33-363,  guidance  found  in  Chapter  7,  and appropriate MAJCOM directives. (T-2). 1.8.  Crew Utilization Policy. 1.8.1.  Commanders  ensure  crew  members  are  trained  to  fill  authorized/required  crew positions per unit type code (UTC). 1.8.2.  Supervisors may assign crew members to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, safety board member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of crew member tasking, proficiency, currency, and experience. (T-3). 1.8.2.1.  Duties  that  would  result  in  a  crew  member  regressing  to  NCMR  are  not  to  be performed. 1.8.3.  For  inexperienced  crew  members,  supervisors  will  make  every  attempt  to  limit  non-mission duties to those related to combat/unit mission training activities. (T-3). 1.8.4.  Crew  members  will  not  perform  long-term  duties  that  detract  from  their  primary duties of training for, or performing the unit combat/specified mission. (T-3). 1.9.  Training Mission/Event Allocation Guidance. 1.9.1.  Inexperienced  crew  members  receive  mission/event  allocation  priority  over experienced crew members.  Priorities for mission/event allocation are as follows: 1.9.1.1.  Operational Units.  IQT, BQ, MQT, and then CMR. 1.9.1.2.  Attached crew members (MAJCOM, Wing, Group, and United States Air Force Weapons School (USAFWS)). 1.9.1.3.  Consideration  is  also  given  to  requirements  directed  by  MAJCOM  to  include:  training  required  to  prepare  for  assigned  projects/tasking,  equipment/system  testing,  or TTPs validation requirements. 1.10.  Supplements/Waivers. 1.10.1.  Supplements. 1.10.1.1.  MAJCOMs  will  coordinate  their  supplements  to  this  instruction  with  HQ USAF/A3OY before publication.  MAJCOM/A3s will approve MAJCOM supplements.  Supplements will not contain procedures that are contrary to this instruction.  Copies of MAJCOM-level  supplements,  after  approved  and  published,  will  be  provided  by  the AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 17 issuing  MAJCOM  to  HQ  USAF/A3OY,  HQ  ACC/A3C  the  user  MAJCOM,  and NGB/A3Y OPRs. 1.10.1.2.  Units, to include DRUs, will coordinate their supplements with the next higher Group, as applicable, prior to MAJCOM approval. (T-3).  MAJCOM OPRs will approve unit  supplements.  (T-2).    ANG  units  will  coordinate  their  supplement  with  NGB/A3Y who in-turn will forward to ACC/A3C for approval. (T-2).   1.10.1.2.1.  DRUs  will  specify  their  equivalent/unique  duty  positions  and  training requirements in their unit supplement. (T-3). 1.10.1.2.2.  Supplementary  guidance  will  not  be  less  restrictive  than  the  basic publication, but can be more restrictive. (T-2).  1.10.1.2.3.  Supplemental guidance will not contradict the basic publication. (T-2). 1.10.2.  Waivers. 1.10.2.1.  Waiver  authority  for  requirements  of  this  volume  will  be  IAW  AFI-33-360, Publications and Forms Management.  Waiver requests must come from commanders (or civilian  directors)  of  the  affected  unit  seeking  relief  from  compliance  through  the command  chain  up  to  the  appropriate  tier  approval  authority  (i.e.,  Tier  0,  1,  2,  3)  (or publications  approval  authority  if  non-tiered).    See  AFI  33-360  for  definition  of  Tier Ratings.  1.10.2.1.1.  Waiver  requests  are  sent  via  email  using  AF  Form  679,  Air  Force Publication  Compliance  Item  Waiver  Request/Approval  and  must  include  the following. (T-2): 1.10.2.1.1.1.  Reference  and  text  of  the  specific  requirement  for  which  the commander/director is requesting a waiver. 1.10.2.1.1.2.  Rationale  for  the  waiver:    Explain  which  of  the  following  three reasons IAW AFI 33-360, apply and describe why: 1.10.2.1.1.2.1.  The  cost  of  compliance  creates  unacceptable  risk  to  a  higher priority task;  1.10.2.1.1.2.2.  The expected cost of compliance outweighs the benefit;  1.10.2.1.1.2.3.  Personnel cannot comply with the requirement due to a lack of resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower). 1.10.2.1.1.3.  Time period or circumstance for which the waiver will be required. (T-2). 1.10.2.1.1.4.  Risk mitigation measures the requesting commander will implement during the waiver period. (T-2). 1.10.2.1.1.5.  Impact if waiver is disapproved. 1.10.2.1.1.6.  Approved  waivers  will  be  uploaded  into  the  unit’s  Management Internal  Control  Toolset  (MICT)  for  inspection  activity  review  and  publication OPR’s situational awareness/filing. (T-2). 18 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 1.10.3.  USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3C, PACAF/A8X, and NGB/A3Y will forward a copy of all approved waivers for their units to ACC/A3C.  ACC/A3C will, in turn, forward a copy of all approved waivers for their units to USAFE/A3C, PACAF/A8X, and NGB/A3Y.  Units will forward all approved waivers and report all deviations or exceptions without waiver, through their chain of command, to MAJCOM OPR. 1.10.4.  Approval/denial  of  waiver  requests  will  be  completed  IAW  AFI  33-360,  paragraph 1.9.4.3. (T-2). 1.10.5.  Duration of waivers will be IAW AFI 33-360 and may be approved for a period not to exceed the requested waiver period or 30 calendar days after the approving commander’s tour  length,  whichever  is  shorter.    Because  waivers  are  the  expression  of  a  specific commander  accepting  risk,  Tier  1,  2,  and  3  waivers  automatically  expire  30  days  after  a change of command unless the new commander renews the waiver. 1.10.6.  Unless  directed  by  the  waiver  authority,  trainees  continue  to  train  while  waiver requests are being staffed. 1.10.7.  File a copy of approved written waivers with this volume IAW AFI 33-360. AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 19 Chapter 2 INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING 2.1.  General.  This chapter outlines the conduct of IQT. 2.1.1.  Any individual who has been unqualified in the CRC for longer than 60 months must accomplish  IQT.  (T-2).    All  individual  crew  members  are  required  to  meet  IQT  syllabus standards. 2.2.  Authority. 2.2.1.  MAJCOM approved syllabi lay out complete IQT requirements for each duty position.  Course  syllabi  do  not  take  precedence  over  the  guidance  in  this  AFI;  however,  units  will conform/adhere  to  the  grading  criteria,  academic/performance  training  standards,  and general/specific instructions unless it specifically conflicts with this AFI. (T-2). 2.2.1.1.  CRC IQT syllabi and course training documents are developed by ACC TRSS, Detachment 9. 2.2.1.1.1.  ACC TRSS, Detachment 9, is responsible for developing, maintaining, and updating the syllabi (except for the AWO, WD, ICT, EPT, and ST IQT syllabi which will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  607  ACS,  in  coordination  with  ACC  TRSS  Det  9, with oversight of HQ AETC/A3FA), academic lessons, and academic courseware for the  lessons  outlined  in  the  IQT  syllabi.    ACC  TRSS  Det  9  ensures  syllabi  are reviewed  every  24  months  or  sooner,  IAW  ACCI  36-2252,  Air  Combat  Command (ACC)  Operations  Training  Publications,  to  account  for  weapon  system  changes, course  critiques,  or  other  data  that  necessitate  earlier  review.    ACC  TRSS  Det  9 documents  the  results  of  the  syllabus  review  and  forwards  a  copy  of  the documentation to  ACC/A3CG,  NGB/A3YG,  USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3CO, AETC/A3F, 552 ACG, and ACC TRSS. 2.2.1.1.2.  Course training documents include everything required to conduct the IQT program.    The  training  package  includes  lesson  plans,  student  guides,  academic lessons,  block  tests,  and  Individual  Mission  Grade  Sheets  to  document  training results. 2.2.1.2.  DRUs  are  responsible  for  syllabus  development  in  support  of  their  IQT  and forward to ACC/A3C for approval. 2.2.1.2.1.  Once the syllabus is approved, DRUs develop their supporting IQT course training documents. 2.2.2.  IQT  is  accomplished  using  MAJCOM-approved  syllabi.    IQT  is  conducted  at  the operational  units  and  the  CRC  Formal  Training  Unit  (FTU)  (607  Air  Control  Squadron (ACS)).    IQT  conducted  at  the  operational  units  will  follow  the  IQT  time  limitation requirements  outlined  in  this  instruction.    IQT  conducted  at  the  FTU  will  follow  the  time limitation requirements outlined in the applicable syllabus. 2.2.3.  Elimination  Procedures.  Units  will  follow  IQT  elimination  procedures  outlined  in specific  course  syllabi  and  the  guidance  outlined  in  this  AFI  and  AFI  11-402  for  rated aircrew members. (T-2).  Training Evaluation Board process is outlined in Attachment 5. 20 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 2.3.  Prerequisites.  Prior  to  entering  CRC/DRU  formal  training,  trainees  must  meet  Air  Force Education  and  Training  Course  Announcements  (ETCA)  selection  prerequisites  at  site  (T-2): https://etca.randolph.af.mil/. 2.3.1.  Commanders  may  enter  newly  assigned  personnel  awaiting  a  security  clearance  into IQT, but may not give training that involves classified information. 2.4.  Training Requirements. 2.4.1.  The  unit  DO  and  COT  review  the  records  of  newly  assigned  personnel  to  ensure  an appropriate  course  of  training.    Experience  and  previous  qualifications  in  the  MDS  are considered in determining the specific training track to be followed. 2.4.1.1.  At  the  CC’s  approval,  individuals  with  specific  prior  experience  or  positional qualifications can be entered into tailored training program developed by the COT. 2.4.1.2.  Requalification.  If a crew member is UQ for less than 60 months, the COT will determine if the crew member will be entered into requalification training or IQT. (T-3).  The unit DO and COT review the records of newly assigned personnel and recommend to the  CC  an  appropriate  course  of  training  based  on  the  individual's  background  and experience.    The  COT  records  the  review  IAW  Chapter  7.    The  DO  ensures  the  COT provides  the  appropriate  academic  and/or  positional  training.    The  COT  may  use MAJCOM  approved  IQT  syllabi,  MQT  materials,  and  other  locally  developed  training materials to conduct requalification training.  Requalification training is used to requalify: 2.4.1.2.1.  Crew  members  that  have  become  UQ  due  to  loss  of  currency  exceeding 180 days, or 2.4.1.2.2.  Crew members downgraded by the unit commander for demonstrated lack of ability/proficiency (paragraph  4.10.1), or 2.4.1.2.3.  Crew  members  who  fail  a  positional  evaluation  or  fail  to  complete  a  re-evaluation by the scheduled date. 2.4.1.3.  Upon completion of requalification training one of the following occurs: 2.4.1.3.1.  The individual is released by the COT to Stan/Eval for the RQ evaluation or 2.4.1.3.2.  If the individual fails the requalification evaluation (RQ): 2.4.1.3.2.1.  The  individual  will  complete  all  assigned  additional  training  (AT) and is then re-released to Stan/Eval or (T-3) 2.4.1.3.2.2.  The individual is referred to the unit commander to take appropriate administrative action IAW Attachment 5, AFI 36-2101, and/or AFI 11-402. 2.4.1.3.2.3.  If  the  individual  again  fails  the  RQ  evaluation  the  unit  commander takes appropriate administrative action IAW Attachment 5, AFI 36-2101, and/or AFI 11-402. 2.4.2.  The  DO  will  ensure  the  COT  provides  the  appropriate  amount  of  training  in  each academic and positional area. (T-3).   AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 21 2.4.2.1.  The  MAJCOM-approved  syllabi  outline  the  training  requirements  for  IQT completion.  The passing grade for academic tests is 85%. 2.4.2.1.1.  Trainees  who  are  proficiency  advanced  through  academic  blocks  are  not required to test on those blocks. 2.4.2.2.  The  minimum  standard  for  block  progress  checks  is  IAW  course  syllabus standards. 2.4.3.  Multi-Qualified    Personnel.  Personnel  who  are  CMR/BMC  in  a  position  and  are selected to  train  in  another position(s) are to  complete  IQT requirements  IAW this chapter.  Time  limitations  still  apply  to  IQT  trainees  who  are  already  CMR/BMC  in  another  crew position. 2.4.4.  Additional training identified during any evaluation must be completed within 30 days (2  UTAs)  from  the  date  of  the  discrepancy  and  documented  IAW  AFI  13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2, paragraph 5.3.2.2. (T-3). 2.5.  Time  Period  to  Qualify.  Personnel  start  and  complete  training  IAW  the  appropriate syllabus/training guides. 2.5.1.  Personnel who attend First Term Airman Center (FTAC) enter IQT the first duty day after completing the FTAC program. 2.5.2.  The  unit  DO  ensures  the  COT  enters  operations  personnel  into  IQT  not  later  than (NLT) 20 calendar days (1 Unit Training Assembly (UTA)) after the member reports to the unit after award of their applicable AFSC. 2.5.3.  Personnel who attend the FTU enter IQT the first day of the FTU course.  Units will request  a  class  date  for  personnel  for  the  FTU  NLT  20  calendar  days  (2  UTAs)  after  the member reports to the unit. (T-2). 2.5.4.  Commanders will report to their respective Group (ACC/A3CG and NGB/A3YG for ANG  units)  individuals  who  are  not  entered  into  IQT  within  the  above  timeline  and  the reason for the delay. (T-3). 2.5.5.  ANG  personnel  awaiting  assignment  to  a  basic  technical  training  course  may  enter IQT without a time limitation. 2.5.6.  IQT  Time  Limitations.  All  trainees  must  complete  IQT  requirements  within  150 calendar days (6 UTAs). (T-3).  Authorized deviations will be IAW paragraph 1.5.6. (T-3).  Upon  completion  of  the  last  block  of  IQT  the  trainee  is  certified  ready  for  their  initial qualification  (INIT  QUAL)  evaluation  by  the  COT  on  AF  Form  4141  and  released  to Stan/Eval to complete an evaluation  IAW AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2.  Stan/Eval has 30 calendar  days  (2  UTAs)  from  completion  of  IQT  to  administer/complete  the  evaluation.  Upon  successful  completion  of  evaluation,  individuals  are  designated  BQ  and  placed  into MQT.  Failure of the trainee to complete IQT requirements within the above time constraints results  in  the  COT  pursuing  actions  outlined  in  the  following  decision  matrix.    Additional details  can  be  found  in  Initial  Qualification  Training  Time  Limitations  Flowchart (Attachment  2).    Trainees  continue  to  train  while  training  extension  requests  are  being staffed. 22 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 2.5.6.1.  Stan/Eval has 30 calendar days (2 UTAs) from completion of AT/requalification training to administer/complete the evaluation. 2.5.6.2.  Upon  reaching  the  150th  calendar  day  (6  UTAs),  the  trainee  who  does  not complete IQT requirements is referred to the unit commander who is authorized to grant a 30 calendar day (2 UTAs) extended training period. 2.5.6.2.1.  The trainee’s unit commander may take actions IAW  Attachment 5, AFI 36-2101,  and/or  AFI  11-402  in  lieu  of  extending  the  training  period  by  30  calendar days. 2.5.6.3.

This chapter and the RTM if published, outline CT event requirements needed to maintain CRC/DRU qualification, currency, and lookback.  CT provides crew members with the volume,  frequency,  and  mix  of  training  necessary  to  maintain  proficiency  at  the  assigned qualification/certification  level.    The  RAP  is  a  category  of  CT  designed  to  focus  combat coded/DOC-tasked  unit  training  toward  projected/forthcoming  contingency  skill  sets.    Specific RAP instructions are issued by each MAJCOM via a RTM. lookback,  are 4.2.  Training  Period.  CT  requirements, designed/planned  to  be  completed  during  a  specified  training  cycle  with  specific  requirements additionally  defined  by  crew  position.    The  training  cycle  is  a  12-month  cycle  beginning  1 October and ending 30 September.   including  event  currency  and 4.2.1.  Every attempt is to be made in an effort to balance training across the entire training cycle. 4.2.2.  Training requirements are based upon crew member experience level at the end of the training cycle or lookback period. 4.3.  Prerequisites.  Crew members will have BQ/CMR/BMC qualification. (T-3).  4.4.  Waivers. 4.4.1.  Waiver  authority  for  RTM  defined  requirements  may  be  delegated  to  unit commanders by the waiver authorities outlined in paragraph 1.10.2. 4.4.2.  Squadron commanders will forward waiver requests IAW paragraph 1.10.2. (T-2).   4.5.  Logging of CT Requirements by Instructors/Evaluators. 4.5.1.  Instructors/evaluators  perform  training  events  IAW  this  volume  or  the  RTM,  if published. 4.5.1.1.  At  the  end  of  the  training  cycle,  up  to  50  percent  of  instructor/evaluator monitored events, (rounded down to the next whole number but not to be below 1), may be  credited  for  required  positional  CT/RAP  training  cycle  events  provided  the instructor/evaluator  monitored  mission  planning  and  any  briefings,  missions,  and debriefings.   4.5.2.  Instructor/evaluator SDs will not log controlled missions for solely supervising AWOs or WDs engaged in  aircraft control.   In order to  log  a  controlled event,  SDs must meet  the provisions of paragraph 4.8.5.2. (T-3). 4.6.  Proration  of  End-of-Cycle  Requirements.  At  the  end  of  the  training  cycle,  the  SQ/CC may  prorate  positional is  TDY,  medically disqualified/DNIC,  or  on  emergency  leave  for  30  cumulative  days  (2  UTAs)  or  more, combat/contingency  deployments  or  operations,  preclude  training  for  a  portion  of  the  training period.  Normal annual leave will not be considered as non-availability. (T-3). training  requirements  when  an individual 4.6.1.  Contingency  Operations.  Contingency  operations  can  have  a  positive  or  negative impact on a unit's overall CT program, as emphasis is on supporting contingency operations.  28 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 A  potential  lack  of  training  on  broader  DOC  mandated  CRC  missions/tasks  could  place  a burden  on  the  unit  and  impact  overall  CRC  combat  mission  capability.    Commanders  will take  this  into  consideration  during  unit  reconstitution  planning,  at  the  end  of  the  training cycle,  and  prior  to  submitting  training  cycle  waivers.  (T-3).    Additionally,  the  following proration procedures are intended to provide commander’s flexibility in accomplishing their unit's CT program. 4.6.1.1.  At the end of the training cycle, CT/RAP events may be prorated for personnel supporting  contingency  operations.    This  proration  encompasses  the  period  of  time (cumulative)  beginning  with  non-system  of  record  (i.e.  Battlespace  Command  and Control Center (BC3)) spin-up training (not to exceed 60 days) through deployment and deployment recovery time (not to exceed 30 days). 4.6.1.2.  Commanders  will  not  prorate  annual  training  requirements  during  contingency operations for operators working on their system of record (EPT).  (T-2).  Currency and lookback requirements apply during the deployment.   4.6.1.2.1.  Crew members not working on their system of record during contingency operations (MCC, SD,  ASO, AST, WD,  ICT and ST) are  allowed to prorate  annual training requirements.  Currency and lookback requirements do not apply during the deployment.    Mission  and  event  achievements  are  tracked  to  document  the  crew member’s career and experience progression. 4.6.2.  Crew  members  that  become  CMR/BMC  after  the  beginning  of  the  training  cycle accomplish  a  prorated  share  of  existing  training  cycle  TRs  for  the  remainder  of  the  period beginning  with  the  first  day  of  the  following  month.    Training  accomplished  during IQT/MQT is not counted toward CT requirements. 4.6.3.  All  training  requirement  events  are  rounded  down  to  the  next  whole  number  when prorating; however, no requirement may be prorated below 1. 4.6.4.  When  a  crew  member  changes  experience  levels,  training  requirements  are  prorated from the first day of the month following experience certification. 4.6.5.  Prorating of requirements are documented IAW Chapter 7. AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 29 Table 4.1.  Proration Chart.  4.6.6.  Proration  Example.    TSgt  Garnett  was  granted  17  days  of  emergency  leave  in January  and  attended  Non-Commissioned  Officer  Academy  (NCOA)  in-residence  from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days.  Using the numbers from  Table 4.1, TSgt  Garnett  would  be  authorized  a  total  of  two  months  proration  (for  the  73  cumulative proration days) from his/her training cycle. 4.7.  CMR/BMC  Regression.  NCMR/NBMC  crew  members  are  not  authorized  to  perform crew duties unless under instructor/evaluator supervision.   4.7.1.  Crew  members  shall  be  regressed  to  NCMR/NBMC  status  for  one  or  more  of  the following reasons (T-3): 4.7.1.1.  Failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.7.2. 4.7.1.1.1.  To  regain  CMR/BMC  status  crew  members  will  follow  guidance  in paragraph 4.7.2.4. (T-3). 4.7.1.2.  Failure to complete training cycle CT/RAP requirements. 4.7.1.2.1.  To  regain  CMR/BMC  status  crew  members  will  follow  guidance  in paragraph 4.8.3.2. (T-3). 30 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 4.7.1.3.  At SQ/CC direction. 4.7.1.3.1.  Regaining CMR/BMC status will be IAW SQ/CC direction. 4.7.2.  Lookback.    Lookback  is  a  management  tool  used  to  determine  and  monitor  CMR crew  member  proficiency  during  the  training  cycle.   Lookback  requirements  are accomplished  during  a  3-month  sliding  window.    Lookback  requirements  are  outlined  in Table 4.2 through Table 4.8 4.7.2.1.  Lookback does not apply to BMC or BQ crew members.   4.7.2.2.  DNIC/DNIF  crew  members’  training  accomplishments  on  virtual/constructive systems will count towards lookback requirements. (T-3). 4.7.2.3.  The  COT  will  calculate  the  3-month  lookback  no  later  than  the  1st  day  of  the month or ANG UTA to ensure CMR crew members meet lookback requirements. (T-3).    SrA  Jones  (an  active  component 4.7.2.3.1.  Example: inexperienced  EPT) participated in two event operations in June and four event operations in July.  If SrA Jones  had  a  3-month  lookback  requirement  of  9  events,  he/she  would  need  to participate  in  three  event  operations  during  the  month  of  August  in  order  to  stay CMR. 4.7.2.3.2.  Lookback  computations  for  newly  qualified  crew  members  begin following completion of INIT QUAL/MSN Eval, as applicable, and 3 full months of CMR status.  Computations for crew members being restored to CMR status will start the month following return to CMR status. (T-3). 4.7.2.3.2.1.  Example:    Capt  Garza  completed  his/her  INIT  QUAL/MSN  on  17 July.    His/her  lookback  computations  will  not  begin  until  1  November.    Even though  Capt  Garza’s  lookback  does  not  start  until  1  November,  any  CT accomplishments  accumulated  from  17  July  –  31  October  are  counted  toward annual training requirements. 4.7.2.4.  Failure to Meet 3-Month Lookback.  If a CMR crew member fails to meet the 3-month lookback requirement, commanders may: 4.7.2.4.1.  Regress the individual to NCMR status or, 4.7.2.4.2.  Remove the individual from a CMR manning position; or, 4.7.2.4.3.  Place the crew member in probation status for 1 month (30 days/2 UTAs).  If the commander chooses probation, the crew member is required to reestablish a 3-month lookback by the end of the probation period to remain CMR. 4.7.2.4.3.1.  Example:    SrA  Jones  (an  active  component  inexperienced  EPT) participated  in  one  event  operation  in  June,  four  event  operations  in  July,  and three  event  operations  in  August.    In  this  example,  SrA  Jones  did  not  meet  the requirement of 9 events for an inexperienced EPT.  With a commander approved probationary period, SrA Jones must complete two event operations in September in order to remain CMR after his/her probation period expires.  The completion of these  two  events  would  reestablish  SrA  Jones’s  lookback  and  prevent  him/her from going NCMR. AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 31 4.7.2.5.  Crew  members  that  regress  to  NCMR  status  for  less  than  6  months  (7  UTAs) will complete DO-approved training  consisting  (as a minimum) of the following before returning to CMR status. (T-3). 4.7.2.5.1.  Monitored  by  an  instructor  for  a  minimum  of  two  control  events  for weapons personnel, two link events for ICT, or two event operations for all others or until such time the instructor recommends the individual be returned to CMR status.  Live, virtual, or constructive events may be used to meet these requirements IAW TR tables.  Document these actions on the AF Form 4141. 4.7.2.5.1.1.  For  personnel  returning  from  an  AEF  deployment, the  unit commander may waive the two (2) event requirement and return crew members to CMR status after one (1) event.  Live, virtual, or constructive events may be used to  meet  these  requirements  IAW  TR  tables.    Document  these  actions  on  the  AF Form 4141. instructor  recommendation 4.7.2.5.2.  Upon  completion  of (documented  on  an  ACC  Form  206),  the  CC  places  the  individual  back  into CMR/BMC status. training  and the 4.7.2.5.3.  The missions and events accomplished during the training may be credited toward a crew member’s 3-month lookback and total mission/event requirements for the training cycle. 4.7.2.6.  If a crew member is NCMR/NBMC for more than 6 months (7 UTAs), the COT accomplishes  the  downgrade  action  to  UQ  status  after  Squadron  CC  approval.    COT documents  the  downgrade  and  enters  them  into requalification  training  with  subsequent requalification  evaluation.    This  does  not  apply  to  crew  members  returning  from  AEF deployment.  Instead, the guidance in paragraph  4.7.2.5.1.1 is followed. 4.7.2.7.  Document all actions IAW Chapter 7. Table 4.2.

The  CT/RAP  training  cycle  consists  of academic and positional training requirements. 4.8.1.  The  DO  is  responsible  for  oversight  of  training  crew  personnel  on  the  general procedures and preparation for executing the unit’s DOC-tasked mission and any applicable operations plans. 4.8.2.  Academic  Training  Requirements.    The  intent  of  the  academic  portion  of CMR/BMC continuation training is to keep day-to-day training relevant and current with the unit’s  DOC-tasked  missions  as  well  as  dynamic  real-world  contingency  environment  and ever-changing tactics, techniques, and procedures.  Recommended academic topic areas and hours are in Table 4.9.  AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 33 4.8.2.1.  The  unit  COT  develops  an  academic  CT/RAP  Training  Plan  based  on  the review,  update,  and  expansion  of  existing  IQT/MQT  materials,  the  inclusion  of  RTM training  areas,  as  well  as  the  introduction  of  current  theater  interest/focus  areas.    The COT  also  includes  in  the  academic  training  plan  any  higher  headquarters  training inputs/guidance.  The proposed plan is submitted to the unit DO NLT 15 days prior to the start of the next training cycle for approval. Table 4.9.  Academic Hours.  4.8.2.2.  The COT, with the approval of the DO, is authorized to adjust the training plan throughout  the  training  cycle  to  meet  a  dynamic  operational  training  environment  or  to address any negative trends. 4.8.2.3.  The  COT  ensures  documentation  of  academic  CT/RAP  training  IAW  Chapter 7. 4.8.3.  Positional  Training  Requirements.    The  intent  of  the  positional  portion  of CMR/BMC continuation training is to keep crew members proficient in the skill sets outlined in  AFI  13-1  CRC  Vol.  3,  Operating  Procedures  –  Control  and  Reporting  Center  (CRC).  Positional  TRs  are  to  be  accomplished  with  a  full  operations  crew  to  the  maximum  extent possible. 34 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 4.8.3.1.  The  COT  ensures  CMR/BMC  individuals  meet  positional  training  cycle requirements as described in Table 4.10 through Table 4.16 or as delineated in the RTM for that training cycle. 4.8.3.1.1.  The  COT  ensures  documentation  of  positional  CT/RAP  training  IAW Chapter 7. 4.8.3.1.2.  No less than 50% of CT/RAP training requirements must be accomplished on  the  unit’s  assigned  system  of  record.  (T-3).    10%  of  CT/RAP  controlled  events must be live. (T-3). 4.8.3.2.  Failure to Meet Positional Training Requirements. 4.8.3.2.1.  Unless waived IAW paragraph 4.4, crew members who fail to accomplish positional training requirements are regressed to NCMR/NBMC status. 4.8.3.2.2.  Unless waived, the crew member remains NCMR/NBMC until all overdue positional training requirements are accomplished or the crew member accomplishes appropriate/specific training, as directed by SQ/CC. 4.8.3.2.3.  Unless specifically waived  IAW  paragraph 4.4, all training requirements for the previous training cycle must be completed before  events  are credited toward the next training cycle. (T-3). 4.8.3.2.4.  Squadron  Commanders,  via  TDRs,  must  inform  applicable  MAJCOM through their chain of command as soon as a potential training shortfalls may result in individuals not meeting their training cycle requirements IAW  paragraph 1.2.6.6.1. (T-2). 4.8.4.  DOs  ensure  virtual/constructive  missions  are  accomplished  in  the  most  effective manner  possible  and  where  live  missions  are  deficient/insufficient.    Virtual/constructive missions/scenarios  increasingly  stress  a  more  difficult  tactical  scenario  as  individual  crew members  and  crews  become  more  proficient.    Finally,  virtual/constructive  missions  stress skills  or  situations  that  are  not  normally  controlled  under  live  conditions  (e.g.,  aircraft emergencies, multiple tankers in different airspaces). 4.8.4.1.  Virtual  missions  include  those  accomplished  through  any  of  the  following environments:  Virtual  Warfighting  System  (ViWS),  Air  Reserve  Component  Network (ARCNet),  Distributed  Training  Operations  Center  (DTOC),  and  any  other  Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) entity (i.e. Virtual Flags, FST-J, etc.). 4.8.5.  CT-CMR/BMC Positional TRs are expressed in terms of the following events. 4.8.5.1.  Event  Operations.    An  event  operation  is  logged  for  training  accomplished during the following:  live flying, virtual/constructive missions, MTEs, or Joint Exercises (JE).  To receive credit,  members sit on position a minimum  of 1 hour, or until  desired learning objectives have been met.  Log an event operation and, if applicable, a mission type (ITE),  Electronic Attack/Electronic Protection (EA/EP), or Link Event).  To the maximum extent possible, units  equipped  with  Tactical  Chat  (TC)  are  to  train  with  the  capability  throughout  the event  operation.    Whenever  possible,  a  full  operations  crew  and  Battle  Staff  are  to  be integrated with the event. Integrated  TACS  Event (Identification (ID)  Scenario, AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 35 4.8.5.1.1.  For  EPTs,  Event  Operations  may  be  logged  for  training  accomplished during  the  completion  of  Periodic  Radar  Evaluation  Program  (PREP)  and/or configuring and monitoring the operational status of the AN/TPS-75 radar using the Radar Control Panel IAW checklists for a minimum of one hour on position. 4.8.5.1.2.  Units are given the discretion of employing available opportunities to meet practical  TRs,  however,  to  log  an  event  operation,  the  crew  member  must  actively engage/enter data into the system. (T-3).   4.8.5.2.  Controlled Event.  A controlled event includes control of any of the following mission  types:  counterair,  counterland,  air  refueling  (A/R).    A  controlled  event  is conducted in the environment listed in the associated training tables, found below, from check-in to hand-off or until the criteria for swapping controllers is met IAW paragraph 4.8.5.2.7. 4.8.5.2.1.  A controlled event may be credited when the following criteria are met (the SD/AWO/WD): 4.8.5.2.1.1.  Briefed the mission. 4.8.5.2.1.2.  Took radar/radio control of the aircraft performing the mission. 4.8.5.2.1.3.  Accomplished at least one of the following, counterair, air refueling, or counterland mission. 4.8.5.2.1.4.  Debriefed the mission. 4.8.5.2.2.  SD/AWOs/WDs may credit more than one type mission or training  event during  combined  missions.    For  instance  in  the  course  of  a  Large  Force  Exercise (LFE), that SD/AWO/WD  may  log  a  counterair  mission  and  air  refueling  mission,  with  two controlled events (one for the counterair and one for the air refueling) along with any other completed training requirements (i.e. link, Integrated TACS, etc.). if  an  SD/AWO/WD  controls  counterair  and  a  refueling, then 4.8.5.2.2.1.  Example 1 (Same Mission Sets).  Capt Johnson, an AWO, controls a counterair  mission,  followed  by  an  air  refueling  event,  then  another  counterair event.    Capt  Johnson  receives  credit  for  two  controlled  events  along  with  one counterair event and one air refueling event (for the sub categories).  4.8.5.2.2.2.  Example  2  (Different  Mission  Sets).  Lt  McFadden,  an  AWO, controls a Counterair mission, followed by an air refueling event, then a Personnel Recovery  (PR)  event.    Lt  McFadden  receives  credit  for  three  controlled  events along with one counterair event, one air refueling event and one PR event (for the sub categories). 4.8.5.2.2.3.  Example  3.  SSgt  Dargan,  a  WD,  controls  a  counterair  mission, followed  by  an  air  refueling  mission.    After  meeting  the  criteria  to  swap controllers SSgt Gates then assumes control of the aircraft after the refueling and completes another counterair mission.  The result of this mission would be SSgt Dargan would receive credit for two controlled events, a counterair event and an air refueling event.  SSgt Gates would receive a controlled event and a counterair event if all "swapping controller" requirements are met (requisite brief, execution, and debrief). 36 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 4.8.5.2.3.  Counterair  Event.  The  SD/AWO/WD  directs  at  least  one  flight  of aircraft  conducting  air-to-air   The SD/AWO/WD  will  control  the  flight  from  check-in  to  hand-off,  or  until  the  criteria for swapping controllers is met. (T-3).  A flight contains at least two aircraft.   tactics  against  a  dedicated  adversary. 4.8.5.2.4.  Air  Refueling  (A/R)  Event.  The  SD/AWO/WD  provides  control  to  an aircraft/flight  conducting  A/R  IAW  AFI  11-214,  Air  Operations  Rules  and Procedures.  The SD/AWO/WD must provide the appropriate level  of control to  an aircraft, or flight of aircraft (where flight integrity is maintained) that rendezvous with a tanker/cell (or fighter simulating a tanker). (T-3).  During A/Rs the SD/AWO/WD may credit one A/R mission per set of receivers or single receiver.   4.8.5.2.5.  Counterland  Event.  SDs/AWOs/WDs  must  mission  plan,  brief  and debrief the conduct of the counterland scenario including coordination with external agencies. (T-3).  The SD/AWO/WD directs at least one flight of aircraft conducting counterland  tactics  against  a  ground  objective.    The  SD/AWO/WD  will  control  the flight  from check-in to  the prosecution of at  least  one objective, or until  the criteria for swapping controllers is met. (T-3).  A counterland mission normally includes the following elements: 4.8.5.2.5.1.  Airspace  management.    Assigning  altitude  blocks  and/or  safe deconfliction between aircraft (manned/unmanned). 4.8.5.2.5.2.  Target Area Brief: Air or ground picture and the objective area. 4.8.5.2.5.3.  Dynamic/Deliberate Tasking: Updated or pre-planned objective. 4.8.5.2.5.4.  Mission Report (MISREP): Mission results documented and passed. 4.8.5.2.6.  Personnel Recovery (PR)/Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) Event.   4.8.5.2.6.1.  Manages/positions executing preplanned  or  real-time  PR/CSAR  plan  to  include  control  or  coordination  of PR/CSAR air support and Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD). participants  while PR/CSAR 4.8.5.2.6.2.  Manages  PR/CSAR  airspace  in  the  PR/CSAR  area,  if  tasked.  Assigns  altitude  blocks  and  establishes  deconfliction  plan  between  aircraft  to include manned/unmanned assets. 4.8.5.2.6.3.  Establishes/executes the PR/CSAR communications plan. 4.8.5.2.6.4.  MISREP:  Mission results documented and passed. 4.8.5.2.6.5.  SDs  supervise  the  conduct  of  a  counterland  scenario  as  well  as coordinate  with  external  agencies  and  pass  Joint  Tactical  Air  (strike)  Request (JTAR)  information  and  provide  area  of  operations  (AO)  updates  IAW  specific scenario special instructions (SPINS). 4.8.5.2.7.  Swapping  controllers:    After  a  minimum  of  two  passes  or  a  knock  it off/terminate  during  counterair  employment,  A/R,  counterland  missions,  or  CSAR missions controllers may hand off control of the mission to another controller so that more than one individual may log a controlled mission for a single set of activity.   4.8.5.2.7.1.  For  counterair  employment  missions,  each  controller  must  control AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 37 fighters  from  fights-on/vulnerable  time  through  terminate/knock-it-off  using briefed control level. (T-3).   4.8.5.2.7.2.  For  A/R  missions  each  controller  must  meet  the  minimum  A/R mission requirements in order to log a controlled mission. (T-3).   4.8.5.2.7.3.  For  counterland  missions  the  SD/AWO/WD  must  control  the  flight during the prosecution of at least one ground objective. (T-3). 4.8.5.2.8.  SDs may control one side of a mission (4v4 or less) and still perform SD duties and may credit a controlled event and event operation.  The SD will not control when simultaneous missions are underway. (T-3). 4.8.5.2.9.  BMC  personnel  may  substitute  counterair  missions  for  A/R  and counterland missions at a 1-for-1 ratio. 4.8.5.3.  ID Scenario.  Plan, execute and debrief the identification of airborne targets and execute tactical action, IAW the rules of engagement (ROE).  A spectrum from simple to complex ID scenarios should be exercised depending on training objectives; however, all ID scenarios will include a defined ID matrix and associated/defined ROE. (T-3).   4.8.5.3.1.  ID  scenarios  are  to  be  conducted  with  a  full  operations  crew  as  often  as achievable.   4.8.5.3.2.  The employment of an air defense artillery fire control officer (ADAFCO) and  associated  supporting  missile  batteries  outlined  in  AFTTP  3-1  CRC  are  to  be integrated when feasible. 4.8.5.4.  Integrated  TACS  Event  (ITE).  An  ITE  is  an  event  where  a  CRC  crew (ADAFCO  when  applicable)  plans  and  executes  operations  using  voice  and/or  datalink (i.e. transmit and receive Link messages to any lateral/vertical command and control (C2) entity) while conducting CRC assigned missions.   4.8.5.4.1.  ITEs are conducted with a full operations crew as often as possible.   4.8.5.5.  Electronic  Attack/Electronic  Protection  (EA/EP).  An  EA/EP  event  occurs when  a  live  or  simulated  system  conducts  EA  against  the  AN/TPS-75  radar, communications  equipment,  or  other  equipment  which  requires/allows  the  crew  to  take appropriate  EP  actions.    Mutual  interference  from  another  AN/TPS-75  radar  is  not considered an external EA source and does not constitute credit for EA/EP.  Efforts are to be made to include EA/EP within ITEs. 4.8.5.5.1.  EPTs  also  perform  EP  events.    EP  includes  the  actions  taken  to  protect personnel,  facilities,  and  equipment  from  any  Electronic  Warfare  (EW)  attack  that may degrade, neutralize, or destroy friendly combat capability. (T-3). 4.8.5.6.  Link Events.  The environments listed in the training tables with respect to Link Events include live and virtual; however, constructive data being transmitted over either of these link environments meets annual training requirements. 4.8.5.6.1.  The  Mission  Crew  Commander  (MCC)  credits  one  Link  event  each  time they perform in the CMR/BMC duty position and a link interface is functioning.  The MCC will be involved in duty related link management tasks to include coordinating real-time link plans/operations with other platforms/organizations, ensuring the crew 38 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 is prepared to link, making sure crew members perform link-related duties properly, providing  adaptation  parameters  to  the  Surveillance  section,  transmitting  weapons status/air  defense  warnings,  and  understanding  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of participants in the link. (T-3). 4.8.5.6.2.  The Senior Director (SD) credits one Link event each time they perform in their  CMR/BMC  duty  position  and  a  Link  interface  is  functioning.    The  Link  event involves  the  sending  and/or  resolution  of  command/information  messages.    The  SD will  be  involved  in  duty  related  tasks  such  as  ensuring  the  weapons  section  is prepared  to  operate  within  the  link,  sending  or  resolving  command  messages,  and coordinating with MCC (or equivalent). (T-3). 4.8.5.6.3.  An  AWO/WD  credits  one  Link  event  each  time  they  perform  in  their CMR/BMC duty position and a  Link interface is functioning.  The  Link  event  must involve the sending and/or resolution of command/information messages. (T-3). 4.8.5.6.4.  The  Air  Surveillance  Officer/Technician  (ASO/T)  credits  one  Link  Event each time they set up, establishes and monitors/maintains links IAW the Operational Tasking  Data  Link  (OPTASK  LINK)  with  a  minimum  of  one  hour  on  position  or when mission objectives have been met. 4.8.5.6.4.1.  The  ASO/T  was  engaged  in  duty  related  tasks  such  as  ensuring  the surveillance  section  is  prepared  to  operate  within  the  link,  entering/exiting/ maintaining picture, designing/implementing/monitoring  filters,  directing  the  surveillance  section  and coordinating with ASO/T (or equivalent) at linked units. ensuring current the link, a air 4.8.5.6.5.  The  ICT  credits  one  Link  Event  each  time  they  perform  in  their CMR/BMC duty position and they meet the following criteria: 4.8.5.6.5.1.  Sets up, establishes and monitors/maintains links IAW the OPTASK LINK for a minimum of one hour or when mission objectives have been met. 4.8.5.6.6.  The ST credits one link event each time they perform in their CMR/BMC duty position and conduct air picture maintenance in a datalink environment. AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 39 Table 4.10.

ST Event Training Requirements (Inexperienced/Experienced).  4.8.6.  Training Event Definitions. 4.8.6.1.  Tactical  Chat  (TC)  –  Develop  familiarization  and  habit  patterns  with  TC hardware  and  software  while  employing  chat  capability  for  coordination,  targeting,  and training TTPs.  4.8.6.2.  Procedural  Control  –  Utilization  of  procedural  control  (point  outs  from  a  fix, self-reporting, etc.) to provide deconfliction of two or more flights or agencies adjacent in time,  space,  or  altitude.    If  simulated,  three  or  more  entities  are  required  for  credit.    At least one flight must be under AWO/WD control to log the event. (T-3).   4.8.6.3.  Dynamic  Targeting  (DT)  –  Dynamic  targeting  is  the  active  process  of identifying,  prosecuting,  and  effectively  engaging  emerging  targets.    The  primary  focus of dynamic targeting is the prosecution of Joint Force Commander (JFC) designated and prioritized time sensitive targeting (TST) and functional component-critical targets. 4.8.7.  Communications Jamming Training.  This paragraph is applicable to all operations personnel  who  use  any  form  of  radio  communication.    Operations  personnel  will  be thoroughly  familiar  with  communications  jamming  (COMM  JAM)  procedures,  such  as recognition, reporting, and resolution. (T-3). 4.8.7.1.  Training  in  the  live  COMM  JAM  environment  is  to  not  only  emphasize operation and use of jam  resistant radios  through local  flying/employment  training with HAVE  QUICK  T-nets  but  also  the  use  of  brevity,  chattermark,  and  other  procedures.  Operations  personnel  need  to  periodically  train  with  other  participants  during  COMM JAM  for  those  occasions  when  the  anti-jam  (AJ)  mode  is  inoperative  or  not  available.  However, great care must be used to ensure realism in developing the tactics, techniques, and procedures to be used, as operating in a less than realistic COMM JAM environment may result in negative training event. JAM 4.8.7.2.  Jamming environment  considers  the  simulated  threat  and  training  objectives.    Jamming  sources may  include  cassette  recordings,  manual/automatic  jammers,  or  inherent  simulator intensity/frequency/duration in the simulated  COMM AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 43 jamming  equipment.    Ensure  jam  resistant  radio  failures,  synchronization  loss,  etc.,  are not unrealistically emphasized. 4.8.7.3.  Unit DO or designated representative ensure sufficient communications jamming training occurs to adequately prepare personnel to operate in a communications jamming environment. 4.9.  Currency/Regaining Currency. 4.9.1.  Currency.  Positional  currencies  are  established  to  ensure  crew  members  maintain  a minimum  level  of  proficiency  in  a  given  event;  and  the  ability  to  safely  conduct  the  event.  See Table 4.10 through  4.16 and the RTM for currency requirements for all crew positions.  If a crew member loses a particular currency, that event may not be performed except for the purpose of regaining currency.  To regain/re-establish currency, events must be accomplished under  the  supervision  of  an  instructor  or  Stan  Eval  Examiner  (SEE)  (Instructors  must  be qualified  and  current  in  all  events  they  are  instructing).  (T-3).    If  the  instructor  deems  the event successful, he/she will document on an ACC Form 206 (or MAJCOM equivalent) then the COT will restore currency and document IAW Chapter 7. (T-3). 4.9.1.1.  Example.  SSgt  Smith  (a  CMR  ICT)  completed  an  event  operation  on  1  Nov.  She  would  then  need  to  complete  another  event  operation  on  or  before  31  Dec  (60 calendar  days)  in  order  to  remain  current.    If  she  does  not  fulfill  this  requirement,  she would be required to be supervised. 4.9.1.2.  An  SD  may  lose  currency  in  control  events  and  still  perform  management functions  such  as  crew  supervision/link  management. is accomplished IAW paragraph 4.9.1.    Regaining  currency 4.9.1.3.  Personnel  with  multiple  qualifications  must  maintain  “Event  Operations” currency (when applicable).  Event operations conducted in one position will not count in a separate crew position. (T-3). 4.9.1.4.  For  ICTs  the  loss  of  currency  in  Link  events  does  not  preclude  them  from performing database management duties. 4.9.1.5.  For  personnel  returning  from  deployment  (and  did  not  work  on  the    system  of record), the currency  clock for all  events  resets  once the individual is  returned to  CMR status. 4.10.  Unqualified  (UQ).  Unqualified is the status to which the unit commander downgrades a qualified individual for failure to maintain proficiency (or as defined in paragraph  1.4.5). 4.10.1.  The unit commander directs  the downgrade of a CMR/BMC qualified individual to UQ  status  when  the  individual  fails  any  positional  evaluation,  fails  to  complete  a  QUAL MSN  by  the  expiration  date,  fails  to  regain  BMC/CMR  status  within  180  days,  or  the  unit commander  determines  an  individual  to  be  non-proficient.    When  an  individual  is downgraded to UQ, one of the following occurs: 4.10.1.1.  Direct  trainee  entry  into  requalification  training  for  30  days  (2  UTAs)  IAW paragraph  2.4.1.2 as required or 4.10.1.2.  Take  appropriate  administrative  action  IAW  Attachment  5,  AFI  36-2101, and/or AFI 11-402. 44 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 4.11.  Unit Certification Program.  Unit-unique positions will be given a certified status. (T-3).  When  applicable,  each  unit  develops  and  implements  a  training  program  for  all  unit  certified positions  IAW  MAJCOM/NAF/Group/unit  directives  and  document  the  certification  IAW Chapter 7. 4.11.1.  Requirements for Special Certifications 4.11.1.1.  Training IAW Chapter 5 and applicable training guides (if available) 4.11.1.2.  Annual training requirements IAW the RTM and this AFI as applicable. 4.12.  Multi-Qualified/Certified Personnel. 4.12.1.  Unit  commanders  may  multi-qualify/certify  personnel  who  demonstrate the knowledge  and  proficiency  skills  required  to  maintain  multiple  CRC/DRU  duty  position qualifications/certifications.    Multiple  qualifications/certifications  provide  unit  commanders the flexibility to address a dynamic training environment and increase combat capability.  4.12.1.1.  Multi-qualified CMR/BMC personnel must achieve the performance standards and  academic  TRs  for  each  position,  however,  when  the  academic  requirements  are identical, they need only be accomplished once. (T-3).  4.12.1.2.  Upon  completing  an  INIT  QUAL  for  a  secondary  qualification,  complete documentation IAW paragraph 7.3.1.6.  Additionally, ensure the documentation reflects both a primary duty position and all other qualifications as secondary duty positions.   4.12.1.2.1.  A  separate  AF  Form  4142,  Individual  Annual  Training  Record,  must  be maintained for each duty position in which an individual holds a qualification. (T-2). 4.12.1.2.2.  For  DRUs,  a  separate  AF  Form  4142  must  be  maintained  for  each  duty position in which an individual holds a qualification. (T-2). 4.12.1.3.  For  secondary  qualifications,  only  50%  of  “secondary”  positional  training requirements must be accomplished. (T-3).  The 50% reduction does not  include control or link events. 4.12.2.  Multiple  system-qualified  personnel  are  only  required  to  meet  CT/RAP  TRs  as  if qualified on a single system with the additional guidance below. 4.12.2.1.  Events  accumulated  while  TDY,  to  include  contingency  operations,  may  be logged  as  CT  events  and  may  count  toward  training  cycle  events  with  the  following exception:  4.12.2.1.1.  A  crew  member’s  primary  system  of  record  training  cycle  events  will never be less than 50 percent of total requirements. (T-3). 4.13.  Mission Training Program (MTP) Requirements (N/A to DRU). 4.13.1.  Mission training is an important part of the training program.  Unit COTs are to seek out  opportunities to train  with  elements  of the ground TACS and Airborne Elements  of the TACS (AETACS), as well as other services.  Units are to participate in Command sponsored exercises  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.    This  instruction  establishes  training  frequency requirements for Category 1 and 2/3 MTEs at Table 4.17.  MTP management is outlined in Attachment 7. AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 45 4.13.2.  Categories  of  MTEs.    These  events  are  categorized  by  the  number  of  participating units and the level of effort within each unit.  There are three categories of MTEs. 4.13.2.1.  Category I (CAT I).  Training which exercises crew positions of a single unit (no  external  participants/agencies).    The  scope  may  vary  from  positional  training  for  a single section to involvement of an entire operations crew. 4.13.2.2.  Category  II  (CAT  II).  Small  scale DMO events  interfacing the CRC with a DMO capable weapons system to execute TTPs and focused mission type training.  The MTE  includes  an  operational  data  link  with  at  least  two  data  link  capable  units participating when possible.  CAT II  also  includes training with  other external  agencies and is not limited to the DMO environment. 4.13.2.3.  Category  III  (CAT  III).    Multiple  external  agencies  usually  on  Distributed Mission  Operations  Network  (DMON)  or  Joint  Training  Exercise  Network  (JTEN).  Large  scale  training  exercises  interfacing  crews  into  a  multi-unit  distributed  scenario.  The  MTE  includes  an  operational  data  link  with  at  least  two  data  link  capable  units participating.  The training emphasis is centered on accomplishing the interactions which are essential to CRC operations and must include interfacing with another element of the TACS. (T-3).  This may include a higher headquarters element and at least one other Air Force  or  joint/combined  service  element.    Units  are  encouraged  to  participate  in  large scale  joint  exercises  i.e.  Virtual  Flags  (VF),  Fleet  Synthetic  Training-Joint  (FST-J) events, Joint Kill Chain Events, Warfighter Focused Events (WFE), Red Flag, etc. Table 4.17.  CRC Annual MTE Frequency Requirements.  46 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 Chapter 5 UPGRADE/SPECIALIZED TRAINING 5.1.  General.  This chapter outlines/establishes the minimum eligibility criteria and the training requirements for upgrade and specialized training. 5.1.1.  Upgrade/specialized  training,  for  the  purposes  of  this  AFI,  is  defined  as  specific academic  and  positional in  a supervisory/higher  crew  position  that  has  as  a  prerequisite  and/or  a  current/previous qualification in another crew position (or experience level) within the same weapon system. to  qualify/certify  crew  members training  required 5.2.  Requirements.  Upgrade  training  requirements  provide  crew  members  with  the  academic, crew,  positional,  and/or  control  activity  needed  to  attain  a  supervisory/higher  level  of  crew certification/qualification.  MAJCOM certification training programs are available via the LMS. 5.3.  Waivers/Extensions.  Waiver  authority  for  upgrade  requirements/prerequisites  is  IAW paragraph  1.10.2.    In  cases  where  current  conflicts  exist  between  initial  qualification  training and upgrade training guidance, initial qualification training guidance takes precedence. 5.4.  Instructor  Upgrade.  Instructor upgrade training prepares crew members for qualification as an instructor in their present crew position.   5.4.1.  The  MAJCOM  approved  syllabus  outlines  the  minimum  training  requirements  for instructor  upgrade  and  is  available  through  ACC/TRSS  Det  9.    The  passing  grade  for  the academic test is 85%. 5.4.2.  Prior  to  nomination  for  instructor  upgrade,  crew  members  must  be  rated  as experienced and qualified in the crew position in which they are selected to instruct.  (T-3).  Enlisted crew members must also hold a 5-skill level (non-waiverable). 5.4.3.  Prerequisites.  The  following  additional  prerequisites  may  be  used  by  squadron commanders as a guide to nominate crew members for instructor upgrade. 5.4.3.1.  Academic  Instructor  Course  (AIC),  Flight  Instructor  Course  (FIC),  and  Battle Management  Instructor  Training  (BMIT)  graduates may be recommended for  Instructor upgrade  after  exhibiting  necessary  CRC  or  DRU  equipment  knowledge.    Graduates  of these  courses  are  not  required  to  complete  the  academic  portion  of  the  C2  Ground Instructor Course (instructor course positional training requirements may also be waived IAW  paragraph    1.10.2),  but  must  still  complete  an  Instructor  evaluation  prior  to assuming CRC instructor duties. (T-2).   5.4.3.2.  USAFWS  and  AWDC  graduates  are  not  required  to  complete  the  C2  Ground Instructor  Course  positional  and  academic  training  and  may  be  considered  for  an  INIT INSTR evaluation after becoming CMR at the discretion of the SQ/CC. 5.4.4.  Those  individuals  who  were  instructor  qualified  on  other  weapons  systems  may  be nominated for instructor upgrade after a minimum of 4 months of being CMR in the similar crew position at the discretion of the SQ/CC. AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 47 5.4.4.1.  Instructors  who  were  certified  prior  to  the  publication  of  the  instruction  will maintain  their  certifications  for  up  to  17  months.  (T-3).    These  instructors  will  then complete an INIT INSTR evaluation IAW AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL Vol. 2. (T-3).  5.4.5.  Crew Position Specific Instruction. 5.4.5.1.  Because  the  duties  of  the  ASO  and  AST  encompass  the  duties  of  ST  and  ICT, Instructor ASO/Ts are authorized to instruct these crew positions as well as each other’s position .  Instructor ICTs may instruct ASO/Ts on link specific tasks. 5.4.5.2.  Similarly,  Instructor  SDs  may  instruct  AWOs/WDs.    Additionally,  Instructor AWOs  and  Instructor  WDs  may  instruct  other  AWOs/WDs  as  well  as  the  weapons control portion of SD training.    5.4.6.  Upon  reaching  the  60th  calendar  day  (4  UTAs),  the  trainee  who  does  not  complete instructor  qualification  training  requirements  is  referred  to  the  unit  commander  who  is authorized to grant a 30 calendar day (2 UTAs) extended training period. 5.4.6.1.  If  the  trainee  does  not  complete  instructor  qualification  training  requirements following the extended training period, the commander may remove the individual from training and  return him/her to  duty  in  their qualified crew position(s).   The commander may elect to enter the individual into instructor qualification training at a later time. 5.4.7.  Personnel  removed  as  instructors  for  any  reason  are  not  automatically  reinstated.  Depending on the circumstances, the individual may be required to accomplish an instructor evaluation administered by Stan Eval prior to re-assuming an instructor role.   5.5.  Specialized  Training.  Within the CRC, there are specific responsibilities, duties, or tasks that fall outside the formal training area and only require certification to document competency in specific or particular duties/tasks.  5.5.1.  Periodic Radar Evaluation Program (PREP) Certification.  The AN/TPS-75 PREP certification  has  been  established  to  task  certify  individuals  to  conduct  the  in-garrison AN/TPS-75  daily  radar  PREP  assessment  in  lieu  of  a  qualified  Electronic  Protection Technician. 5.5.1.1.  AN/TPS-75  PREP  certification  training  will  be  accomplished  IAW  ACC AN/TPS-75 PREP training program, located on the LMS, prior to task certification by an authorized certification official.

Individuals    selected  to  be  BSC  certifiers  will  be  appointed  by  the commander. 7.3.1.8.  The  COT  documents  regression  to  NCMR/NBMC  status  and  return  to CMR/BMC status on AF Form 4141. 7.3.1.9.  The COT documents downgrade to UQ status and rationale. AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 53 7.3.1.10.  The COT documents entrance and completion of requalification training. 7.3.1.11.  When the commander grants a probationary period for an individual to meet 3- month lookback requirements, this decision is documented on AF Form 4141. 7.3.1.12.  Proration  of  requirements  is  recorded  on  AF  Form  4141  and  certified  by  the commander. 7.3.1.13.  The  COT  documents  when  personnel  fail  to  make  satisfactory  progress  in initial  qualification,  mission  qualification,  requalification  or  continuation  training (IQT/MQT/RQT/CT), to include a synopsis of the event in the remarks section. 7.3.2.  AF Form 4142, Individual Annual Training Record.  This form is used to document training  accomplishments.    The  COT  records  accomplishment  of  academic  and  positional TRs and instructor or Stan/Eval-monitored accomplishments on AF Form 4142.  Hard copies of the AF Form 4142 are verified, authenticated, and signed by the COT. 7.3.2.1.  DOT maintains an AF Form 4142 for the following personnel: 7.3.2.1.1.  Assigned/attached personnel possessing a 13BXX/1C5X1/1C5X1D AFSC who maintain CMR/BMC qualification or certification. 7.3.2.1.2.  A  separate  AF  Form  4142,  must  be  maintained  for  each  duty position/qualification or certification. (T-2). 7.3.2.2.  Completed AF Form 4142s are maintained IAW paragraph 7.4. 7.3.3.  AF  Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification.    This  form  is  primarily  used  by Stan/Eval  to  record  evaluations;  however,  the  COT  uses  it  to  certify  completion  of  any additional training requirements that result from evaluations.  The instructor completing the additional training (or last training event if more than one) will notify the COT, or NCOIC if COT  is  not  available,  that  additional  training  is  complete  (along  with  providing  supporting mission  gradesheet  documentation).  (T-2).    The  COT  or  NCOIC  as  noted  above,  will  sign and date the “Date Additional Training Completed” block in Section II of the AF Form 8. (T-2).  Specific guidance for completing the AF Form 8 is contained in AFI 13-1 STAN/EVAL Vol. 2. 7.4.  Permanent Training Record.  DOT maintains a permanent training record for all assigned and attached personnel.  DOT uses individual 6-part folders and identifies each folder by typing the  individual’s  last  name,  first  name,  and  middle  initial  in  capital  letters  on  a  standard  size folder  label.    Folders  must  bear  the  “Privacy  Act”  statement  and  a  “For  Official  Use  Only” label/stamp  on  both  sides  of  the  folder.  (T-2).    This  label  is  affixed  to  the  folder’s  tab.    The training  officer  may  pencil  in  additional  information  on  the  label  (e.g.,  rank,  crew,  director designator).  Tests or test answer sheets are not filed in this folder.  Current AF Form 4141 and AF  Form  4142  may  be  kept  in  a  separate  binder  for  ease  of  record  keeping,  but  forms  will  be returned to the permanent training records prior to the individual’s permanent change of station. (T-3). The permanent training record is organized as follows: 7.4.1.  Section  I,  Qualification  Data.  This  section  contains  the  current  copy  of  AF  Form 4141 and AF Form 4142.  Place the AF Form 4141 on the left side and AF Form 4142 on the right  side  of  Section  I.    A  DD  Form  2861,  Cross-Reference,  can  be  used  to  reflect  the location of the information. 54 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 II,  Personal  History.  This 7.4.2.  Section section  contains  any  other  current records/documents  pertaining  to  qualifications,  certifications  or  proficiency,  to  include waivers.    Within  this  section,  DOT  also  maintains  ACC  Form  206s  (or  MAJCOM equivalent)  for  training  accomplished  within  the  last  year  (return  to  status  following NCMR/NBMC, additional training as a result of an evaluation, IQT or MQT, etc.).  After one year,  these  ACC  Form  206s  (or  MAJCOM  equivalent)  are  moved  to  Section  IV  and maintained IAW paragraph 7.4.4.   7.4.2.1.  System-specific  task/task  qualification,  or  the  computer-generated  product  (e.g. Difference Training), is maintained in this section or in a database.  All other information will be filed in chronological order (with most recent on top). (T-3). 7.4.3.  Section  III,  Medical  Qualification/Medical  Waivers.  This  section  includes  a current  copy of the annual DD Form 2992,  Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational  Duty,  for  all  13BXD  and  1C5X1D  personnel.    A  DD  Form  2992  placing  an individual  on  DNIC  status  is  also  kept  during  the  DNIC  period.    When  applicable,  the  AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record, is placed behind the current DD Form 2992.  In addition, medical profiles that affect operational status will be filed in this section. (T-3).    Sensitive  medical  history  or  other  records  of  a  personal  medical  nature  will  not  be maintained  in  this  file.  (T-0).    If  medical  documentation  is  sensitive,  a  memo  for  record, signed by the commander, is placed in this section.  After an individual is placed on DNIC status,  DOT  will  keep  the  DD  Form  2992  during  the  DNIC  period  (30  days  or  more),  and annotate the AF Form 4141. (T-3). 7.4.4.  Section IV, Training History.  This section includes certificates from AETC courses, MAJCOM  formal  courses,  and  any  formal  ground  environment  training.    This  material  is filed chronologically with the latest date on top and kept as a permanent part of this folder.  Also  contained  are  the  commander’s  justification  for  late  entry  into  IQT.    However,  upon PCS,  all  computerized  products  must  be  translated  into  hardcopy  and  placed  in  the appropriate section. (T-3).   7.4.4.1.  All  ACC  Form  206s  (or  MAJCOM  equivalent)  moved  here  from  Section  II following the first year will be maintained in this section for a minimum of one more year (longer periods of ACC Form 206 (or MAJCOM equivalent) maintenance as directed by the SQ/CC or SQ/DO are authorized).  These ACC Form 206s (or MAJCOM equivalent) will be filed behind all the historical info noted above. (T-3). 7.4.5.  Section  V,  Miscellaneous    Experience.  This  section  contains  completed  AF  Form 4141/4142  and  control  experience  forms  from  other  commands.    File  these  forms chronologically with the latest date on top as a permanent part of the training folder. 7.5.  Transfer  of  Records.  Upon reassignment (PCS/Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) only),  an  individual  will  hand  carry  the  permanent  records  to  the  gaining  unit.  (T-3).    If  the gaining  unit  has  access  to  the  LMS  then  the  losing  DOT  will  notify  the  LMS  Analysis  and Resolution Center (ARC) by email to coordinate transferring the individual to the gaining unit’s domain.  (T-3).    If  the  losing  and  gaining  units  are  using  PEX  or  other  MAJCOM-approved program, transfer the individual’s records IAW the program’s parameters. 7.5.1.  Where available, the information required by AF Form 4141/4142 will be maintained within  the  LMS,  PEX,  or  other  MAJCOM-approved  program  IAW  MAJCOM  guidance AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 55 (instead of hardcopy). (T-3).  If the LMS version is used, upon PCS/TDY, the losing unit will contact the LMS Help Desk and request the individual’s record be placed in a “hold” status and DOT will print a hard copy of the AF Form 4141 to be hand-carried with the individual. (T-3).  Upon the individual’s in-processing with  DOT, the  gaining unit’s  COT will contact the LMS Help Desk to have the individual’s record entered into their unit’s domain. (T-3).  If using  PEX  or  other  MAJCOM-approved  program  units  will  use  the  specific  program’s parameters  to  transfer  the  records.    If  the  individual  is  PCSing  to  a  unit  that  does  not  have LMS,  PEX,  or  other  MAJCOM-approved  program  access,  print  a  hardcopy  of  the individual’s AF Form 4141, place this hardcopy in the six-part training folder and have the individual hand carry the folder to next unit. 7.6.  Training  Deficiency  Reports  (TDR).  This  paragraph  prescribes  the  method  for  units  to submit training deficiency reports.  Units are required to provide training status IAW paragraph  1.2.6.6.1 7.6.1.  A  unit  commander  submits  a  TDR  to  identify  problems  beyond  the  unit’s  ability  to resolve and that may prevent the unit or individual(s) from satisfying academic or positional TRs.    TDRs  identify  known  or  potential  training  problems  to  higher  headquarters  for information  and  management  purposes.    TDR  identified  issues  are  to  be  resolved  at  the lowest level of command.  TDRs may be submitted at any time during the training period. 7.6.2.  As a minimum, the unit commander submits the following information: 7.6.2.1.  Broken  equipment  that  has  an  impact  on  training  (to  include  simulation equipment) 7.6.2.2.  Lack of live, virtual, or constructive events for training 7.6.2.3.  Lack of live and virtual events for evaluations 7.6.2.4.  Instructor/evaluator shortfalls 7.6.2.5.  Airspace limitations 7.6.2.6.  Inability to  conduct effective MTEs (not applicable (N/A) to DRUs, 552 ACG, 752 OSS) 7.6.2.7.  Mode 4 training shortfalls 7.6.2.8.  Computer operations to include hardware and software problems 7.6.3.  Squadrons submit TDRs through their chain of command via electronic means.  Units will use the following format and provide sufficient detail that will lead to specific action to resolve the issue. (T-2): 7.6.3.1.  Title:  Training Deficiency Report 7.6.3.2.  Unit:  Unit submitting the training deficiencies 7.6.3.3.  Description of problem 7.6.3.4.  Date problem began/expected to begin 7.6.3.5.  Corrective action taken/anticipated 7.6.3.6.

Additional  Training—Any  training  or  action  recommended  by  an  examiner  to  remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation  Attached Personnel—Personnel not assigned to a unit’s manning document but assigned to the unit and maintaining a positional certification/qualification in order to support the attached unit’s mission.  MAJCOM and NAF personnel are examples of attached personnel.  Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC)—A  crew  member  who  has  satisfactorily  completed  IQT  and MQT, is  qualified in  some aspect  of the unit mission, but  does not  maintain CMR status.   The crew  member  must  be  able  to  attain  full  qualification  to  meet  operational  taskings  within  30 days. (T-2).  This status also applies to those individuals who are assigned to a unit that does not have a DOC tasking.  BMC crew members do not maintain CMR status due to duty assignment or other reasons as determined by the appropriate authority. Basic  Qualified  (BQ)—A crew member who has satisfactorily completed IQT and is qualified to  perform  crew  duties  within  the  unit.    The  member  must  perform  at  the  minimum  frequency necessary to meet lookback/currency. (T-2). Certification—1)  Procedure  used  to  document  competency  in  a  particular  task.    Not interchangeable  with  “qualification,”  which  requires  AF  Form  8  documentation.    2)  A  formal indication of an individual’s ability to perform a task to required standards.  3) The formal action of completing/signing documentation taken by a certification official, i.e., “the unit commander certified the AF Form 8”.   Certification  Official—A  commander  or  designate,  authorized  to  determine  an  individual’s ability to perform a task to required standards.

Models  and simulations  that  involve  simulated  people  operating  simulated  systems.  Real  people  stimulate (make inputs) to  such simulations.  Constructive simulations can also  be used to  model natural processes without human involvement (e.g. weather) Currency—Currency  is  associated  with  specific  training  requirements  and  is  a  Commander’s tool  established  to  ensure  crew  members  maintain  a  minimum  level  of  proficiency  in  a  given event.  Distributed  Mission  Operations  (DMO)—A  training/exercise  environment  that  uses  virtual and  constructive  entities  to  conduct  mission  training  from  individual  operator  training  through LFE scenarios.  DMO encompass DTOC/ARCNet/Virtual Warfighting System (ViWS) and any other DMO entity (i.e. Virtual Flag, FST-J, etc.). Distributed  Training  Operations  Center  (DTOC)—Provides  daily  training.    Full  Spectrum DMO support from  small-scale to  large force scenarios.  Most events  are  individually focused, but  capable  to  support  multi-player  events  with  mission  planning  and  white  force  support.   Current  and  qualified  pilots  use  simulation  tools  and  communications  to  replicate  participating aircraft. Evaluation—1)  The  procedure  to  determine  the  effectiveness  of  the  performance  of  an instructional product or process in order to ascertain specific causes for the effectiveness or lack of it, and to make decisions appropriate to the extent of the effectiveness.  Evaluation of formal courses  includes  field  evaluation  and  internal  evaluation.    2)  The  review  and  analysis  of qualitative  or  quantitative  data  obtained  from  design  review,  hardware  inspection,  testing  or operational  use  of  equipment.    3)  The  positional  and  written  examinations  used  to  determine proficiency as prescribed by governing directives.  Event  Operation—A  term  used  to  describe/capture  training  tasks  by  crew  position  that  once accomplished may be logged/credited toward the crew member’s continuation training cycle or RAP training event requirements.  Experienced—A category of crew members associated to crew position, and defined by one or more of the following criterion: AFSC, type of qualification, amount of time the individual has been qualified.  Extended Training Period—Training period designed for individuals who fail to progress into the next phase of training.  Inexperienced—A category of crew members that do not meet the criterion required to establish experienced status.   Initial  Qualification  (INIT)—The  first  evaluation  given  to  determine  an  individual’s  Basic Qualification (BQ) status.   Instructor—Experienced  CMR/BMC  individual  qualified  to  instruct  the  operations  duties  of  a designated crew position(s).   Initial  Qualification  Training  (IQT)—Training  necessary  to  initially  qualify  individuals  in  a basic crew position to perform duties without regard to the unit’s mission.  Upon completion of the INIT QUAL, individuals attain Basic Qualification (BQ) status.  AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 65 Learning  Management  System—An  Air  Combat  Command  approved  training  management system  used  to  provide  online  courseware  and  tracking  of  training  accomplishments  for  the ground  command  and  control  units.    It  provides  a  myriad  of  training  management  reports  on individual training accomplishments and is accessible via the internet to all users.  Mission Evaluation (MSN)—An evaluation given after MQT to certify an individual as CMR.  Mission—Department  of  Defense  definition:    The  task,  together  with  the  purpose,  that  clearly indicates  the  action  to  be  taken  and  the  reason  therefore.    In  common  usage,  especially  when applied to lower military units, a duty assigned to an individual or unit, a task.  For the purpose of  this  AFI,  a  more  detailed  explanation  of  this  term  applies:    A  mission  includes  briefing, controlling and debriefing.  Briefings include training objectives.  Controlling consists of taking radio  and  radar  control  of  aircraft  and  accomplishing  one  or  more  types  of  missions,  such  as counterair,  air  refueling,  counterland,  and  active  air  defense  scrambles.    Debriefing  occur  with the  pilots  (and  instructor  where  applicable).    The  brief/debrief  may  be  accomplished  via telephone/radio; however, face-to-face briefs provide optimum training. Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Specific training designed to prepare crew members to perform duties/tasks in support of a unit mission or tasking.   Non-Combat Mission Ready/Basic Mission Capable (NCMR/NBMC)—The status of a crew member:  1)  who  failed  to  meet  lookback;  2)  who  failed  to  complete  training  cycle  CT/RAP requirements; 3) downgraded at the direction of the commander.  Positional  Training—Hands-on  training  resulting  from  performance  of  duties  in  assigned positions.  Proficiency—A  measure  of  how  well  a  task  is  completed.    A  crew  member  is  considered proficient when they can perform tasks at acceptable levels of speed, accuracy, and safety.  Prorating—A process used to determine a crew member’s training requirement proportionately based on approved consideration to include TDY (including contingency operations), medically disqualified/DNIC, or emergency leave status for more than 30 days.  Qualification—A  status  assigned  to  a  crew  member  after  completion  of  specific  positional training  and  the  accomplishment  of  an  evaluation  resulting  in  the  generation  of  AF  Form  8 documentation.  Ready Aircrew Program (RAP)—RAP is a MAJCOM specific Continuation Training program that applies to CMR crew members.  RAP guidance is issued either by memorandum to combat coded/DOC-tasked units or this AFI to non-combat coded units.  It is intended to focus training toward  current  and  relevant  combat  skills.    The  MAJCOM  RTM  takes  precedence  over  the positional event requirements outlined in Chapter 4 for combat coded units.  Requalification Training—Training for crew members who are designated UQ who 1) fail any positional evaluation, 2) fail to complete a QUAL MSN by the scheduled date, 3) fail to regain currency  within  180  days,  (N/A/  following  AEF  deployment)  or  4)  who  are  determined  by  the unit commander to be non-proficient.  Training Period—A specific amount of time to accomplish a prescribed phase of training.  66 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 Training Cycle—A specifically defined period associated with defining, tracking, reporting, and documenting continuation/RAP Training requirements.  The training cycle for CRCs and DRUs is 1 October through 30 September.  Unit Training Assembly (UTA)—For the purpose of this instruction, a UTA is the 2 day period per month ANG personnel spend on duty, the UTA is 1 full ANG drill weekend.   Unqualified—The  status  of  an  individual  who:  1)  Downgraded  for  being  non-CMR/non-BMC (NCMR/NBMC) greater than 6-months or 2) Downgraded for a demonstrated lack of ability or 3)  Downgraded  for  failure  to  meet  standards  during  a  periodic  evaluation  or  at  Commander discretion following a Commander-directed downgrade  Upgrade  Training—Specific  academic  and  positional  training  required  to  qualify  in  a supervisory/higher  crew  position  that  has  as  a  prerequisite,  a  current/previous  qualification  in another crew position (or experience level) within the same weapon system.  Virtual—Involves warfighters operating simulated systems .  Virtual simulations inject human-in-the-loop in a central role by exercising motor control skills (e.g., flying an airplane), decision skills  (e.g.,  committing  fire  control  resources  to  action),  or  communication  skills  (e.g.,  as members of a C4I team) .   Virtual Warfighting System (ViWS)—The pilot position in a Mission Training Center (MTC) that  dynamically  simulates  flight  characteristics.    Used  for  normal,  emergency,  and  instrument procedures, to include safety of flight, warfighting tasks, and skill integration training (see, AFI 36-2251).

The  purpose  of  this  attachment  is  to  establish/outline  procedures  to  be  taken when  non-rated  personnel  fail  to  make  satisfactory  progress  in  initial  qualification,  mission qualification, or continuation training.  Procedures to remove a rated officer from training and/or flying  related  duties/operations  are  outlined  in  AFI  11-402,  Chapter  4,  Flying  Evaluation Boards.  This attachment only applies to non-rated personnel (officer and enlisted) assigned to a CRC/DRU.    The  complete  rights  of  non-rated  personnel  are  contained  in  this  attachment.    A TEB is not required for individuals in training for secondary or beyond qualifications. A5.1.1.  The TEB is an administrative, fact-finding proceeding designed to ensure the quality control of the CRC/DRU non-rated officer and  enlisted force.  Board members examine an individual’s  professional  qualification  for  CRC/DRU  related  duties  and  evaluate/determine potential for use in future operations. A5.2.  Policy.  Per AFI 36-2626, Airman Retraining Program, Air Force policy is to retain and retrain  only  those  Airmen  who  have  demonstrated  the  ability  to  successfully  complete  training and  whose  past  record  clearly  justifies  further  training.    IAW  training  syllabi  elimination procedures,  utilization  of  the  administrative  actions  outlined  in  this  attachment  are  based  upon failure  of  an  individual  to  attain  a  duty  qualification,  failure  to  re-qualify,  or  to  maintain proficiency levels outlined in this instruction.  These procedures are not  meant to replace or be used in place of punitive disciplinary action and are not a substitute for action under the UCMJ, state military law, or other administrative directives.   A5.3.  TEB  Convening  Authority.  The  TEB  convening  authority  is  the  organization  at  the Group  level  or  above  with  the  authority  to  direct  a  unit  commander  to  establish  a  TEB.    The commander/organization  having  a  command  relationship  with  the  unit  conducting  the respondent’s  training  has  convening  authority/jurisdiction  for  establishment  of  the  TEB.    The convening  authority  for  ACC  active  duty  units  is  the  552  ACG  Commander.    The  convening authority  for  ACC-gained  units  and  for  DRUs  is  ACC/A3C.    The  convening  authority  for PACAF  and  USAFE-AFAFRICA  units  are  PACAF/A8X  and  USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3C, respectively (notify NGB/A3Y for ANG personnel as applicable).  The TEB convening authority may be delegated to the unit commander on a case-by-case basis by the unit commander’s next higher authority.  The commander initiates the TEB process by forwarding a TEB request to the convening authority for review/action.   A5.3.1.  Appeal  Authority.    The  appeal  authority  for  the  TEB  process  outlined  in  this attachment  is  the  convening  authority.    In  cases  in  which  the  unit  commander  is  the convening authority, the appeal authority is the commander/organization having a command relationship with the unit conducting the member’s training. A5.3.2.  Cause.    Failure  of  a  crew  member  to  attain  or  maintain  qualification  in  a  crew position and/or failure to meet required standards when enrolled in an upgrade course. A5.3.3.  Respondent.  A  crew  member  whose  performance  does  not  meet  established standards, and for whom the TEB action has been requested or is being considered. AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 71 A5.3.4.

General.    The Mission Training Program is an integral part of the overall command and control  (C2)  training  effort.    The  simulation  program  is  designed  to  provide  a  spectrum  of training  events  to  exercise  individuals,  single  units,  and  multi-unit  configurations  in  a  high-fidelity  virtual  battlespace.    This  training  program  utilizes  a  combination  of  mission  training materials and a full scope of MTEs. A7.2.  Mission  Materials.    The  training  materials  provide  the  weapons  system  and  crew information  necessary  for  unit  personnel  to  perform  their  mission  essential  tasks.    These materials  include  contractor-generated,  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  generated,  and  unit generated products.  Guidelines for the integration of mission materials into the execution of the CRC functions are set forth in AFI 13-1CRC, Vol. 3 and the applicable USAF TTPs A7.3.  Simulation.  The CRC simulation program is a means to provide effective training on the mastery of key skill sets without the requirement of multiple live combat assets in the scenario.  The simulation events are broken into these basic areas: A7.3.1.  Individual  Training.  Training  designed  for  individuals  to  achieve  a  proficiency level to fulfill IQT and MQT requirements.  CT enhances and hones initial skills to achieve a .maximum level of proficiency in preparedness for combat. A7.3.1.1.  Simulation  events  consist  of virtual  and constructive  entities.   Virtual  entities use  actual  weapons  system  operators  in  their  Mission  Design  Series  (MDS)  simulators.  Constructive entities are simulated entities that may or may not be actual operators using simulation  models  and  communications  to  replicate  a  participating  platform  or  agency.  Computer generated forces are simulated  entities built  within the constructive simulator that act as a self-adjusting force against the trainer’s virtual entity. A7.3.2.  Single  Internal  Unit  Training.  Personnel  or  crews  are  trained  in  a  simulated operational  environment  to  enhance  cohesion  and  to  refine  coordination  between  the Operations  crew  members  and  the  unit’s  supporting  functions.    Communications  and simulation data  are internally generated and distributed. A7.3.3.  Multi-Unit External Training.  The participating TACS elements and CAF aircraft units  train  to  perform  as  an  integrated  force.    The  two  major  network  backbones  used  to support  these  complex  simulation  events  are  the  DMON  or  the  JTEN.    MTEs  are  to  be conducted using the DMON to the maximum extent possible. A7.3.4.  DMO  is  a  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Air  Force  (CSAF)  directed  readiness  initiative  to train  warfighters.    The  DMO  vision  is  to  provide  warfighters  routine  in-garrison  access  to multiple,  simultaneous,  and  large/small  training  or  mission  rehearsal  events  within  a  true joint  force  environment  while  avoiding  the  traditional  expense  and  disruption  of  having  to assemble  assigned  units  and  opposing  forces  for  training  at  a  common  and  observable physical location.  The primary objective underpinning DMO is enabling warfighters to train as they would expect  to  fight,  maximizing the combat realism  available in modern visually immersive simulators that cannot be replicated in expensive traditional live training.  DMO AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 81 capability  within the CRC enables a mission  crew, small  teams, or individuals to  train  in a stand-alone  or  networked  mode  with  other  DMO  participants  through  a  full  range  of composite force employment options. A7.4.  Principles of Mission Training Events.   MTEs are based on five established principles of learning. A7.4.1.  Function.    Train  as  a  functional  section,  complete  operational  crew  or  as  an integrated CRC.  MTEs are sufficiently complex to allow realistic training regardless of the level  of  participation.    Each  element  can  receive,  process,  and  take  action  on  all  essential information generally available within the platform. A7.4.2.  Realism.    Simulate  the  real  environment.    In  order  to  get  maximum  training,  the inputs,  interactions,  and  outputs  from  the  CRC    strive  for  realism.    Realistic  actions  are essential  in  order  to  maximize  the  transfer  of  training  to  actual  operations.    During  MTEs, personnel perform their functions just as they would in combat.  The exercise “White Cell” team observes and records crew performance. A7.4.3.  Stressors.    Train  the  mission  crew  to  operate  under  stress.    The  mission  crew  is trained to effectively handle a variety of stressful situations as well as to develop and keep a high level  of proficiency in  operations execution  and platform interface.   Simulation  of the battlespace  permits  control  of  the  LFE  or  contingency  theater  operations  training  situations introduced to operations not normally met in day-to-day training. A7.4.4.  Feedback.    Provide  the  participants  with  immediate  knowledge  of  mission  crew performance  in  order  to  improve  overall  performance.    Crew  members  being  trained  are furnished  feedback  from  the  mission  execution  results.    Detailed  performance  records  are kept  by  the  exercise  “White  Cell”  team  to  allow  the  team  to  systematically  assess participation,  identify  specific  problems,  capture  lessons  learned,  debrief  the  mission  crew, and provide positional trend analysis. A7.4.5.  Frequency.    Exercise  mission  crews  regularly  and  frequently.  An  effective  MTP requires that training events are held regularly and frequently.  Operational personnel are to continue  to  practice  in  handling  a  variety  of  battle  management  situations  if  they  are  to develop  and  maintain  a  high  level  of  proficiency  and  flexibility  in  the  use  of  operational skills and procedures. SECTION A7B— A7.5.  General.  The MTP provides the CRC with a controlled and standardized event that can be  used  as  a  basis  for  valid  assessment  of  mission  crew  performance.    It  is  incumbent  upon commanders at each echelon of command to support this training activity for peak unit combat readiness.  A7.6.  MAJCOM MTP Responsibilities.

Coordinate  with  the  unit  tactics  office,  Stan/Eval,  and/or  training  office  to  ensure event/evaluation objectives and TTPs are implemented in the simulation. A7.9.8.  Follow guidance stipulated in unit Operating Instructions (OI) for DMO missions (if available/applicable). A7.10.  Exercise Director.  The Exercise Director will: (T-3) A7.10.1.  Supervise the overall conduct of all major scenario training events involving a full mission crew. A7.10.2.  Lead  the  exercise  team  “White  Cell”  which  includes  simulation  supervisor, simulation operators and other personnel on the team providing notional entities or agencies to support the exercise scenario. A7.10.3.  Plan  and  develop  simulation  scenarios  to  maximize  realistic  training  for  the mission crew. A7.10.4.  Coordinate with exercise team personnel (White Cell) and develop/review MSEL. A7.10.5.  Provide dynamic inputs, as necessary, to enhance training objectives. A7.10.6.  Follow guidance stipulated in unit OIs for DMO missions (if available). A7.10.7.  Coordinate with all units to ensure unit training objectives are implemented in the simulation  scenario  and  all  internal/external  units  training  objectives  are  understood  to maximize training for all exercise participants (CAT II & CAT III). A7.10.8.  Ensure MTE objectives are met. A7.10.9.  Ensure  an  After  Action  Report  is  produced  in  accordance  with  Section  G  and submitted through channels to ACC/A3CG or USAFE-AFAFRICA /A3CO NLT ten working days following the end of an exercise. A7.11.  Exercise  Conduct.    There  are  three  phases  in  the  conduct  of  an  exercise:  planning, execution, and assessment. A7.11.1.  Exercise Planning.  A large part of the planning process is to determine the CRC mission essential competencies (MEC) to be demonstrated within the MTE prior to the start of the simulation exercise.  MECs are the DMO higher-order individual, team, and inter-team competencies that fully prepare the operations crew for successful mission completion under adverse  conditions  and  in  a  non-permissive  environment.    They  are  demonstrated  in  the context of a high-fidelity simulated mission, under wartime conditions.  During the exercise, AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 85 training  emphasis  may  be  placed  on  either  the  functional  interaction  of  the  participating elements  or  the  reactions  to  changing  situations  within  the  individual  units.    Also, commanders  may  emphasize  specific  parts  of  an  exercise  to  determine  strengths  and/or weaknesses,  and  to  identify  areas  requiring  additional  training.    The  planning  phase  of exercise  implementation  requires  that  exercise  personnel  at  all  echelons  check  MTE  Air Tasking  Orders  (ATO),  Airspace  Control  Order  (ACO),  Tactical  Operations  Data (TACOPDAT), OPTASK LINK, Enemy Order of Battle (EOB), Operations Plans (OPLAN), Operations  Orders  (OPORD),  and/or  the  exercise  description  in  detail  to  make  sure  they understand  the  exercise  content,  objectives,  and  requirements.    Thorough  pre-exercise briefings  are  an  integral  part  of  the  planning  phase.    Prior  to  the  exercise,  simulation personnel  are  to  be  briefed  on  the  training  objectives  and  MSEL  for  the  dynamically generated or scripted stress situations to be injected into the exercise.  Refer to Section I for an example stress input sheet. A7.11.2.  Exercise Execution.  For effective training, unit personnel execute the exercise in the same manner in which they would operate in combat.  The training benefits derived from high-fidelity  simulations  are  directly  related  to  the  willingness  and  ability  of  simulation personnel to inject realism into MTE play.  For unit personnel to receive top benefit from an MTE,  it  is  necessary  for  the  White  Cell  to  be  familiar  with  the  agencies/positions  they  are simulating  and  to  be  as  realistic  as  possible  when  employing  simulation  techniques.    Sim drivers  are  encouraged  to  respond  and  react  as  if  under  real  combat  operations.    The simulated  environment  draws  responses,  reactions,  and  activities  from  the  participants  that are identical to an actual combat environment and requires strong command level support. A7.11.3.  Exercise Assessment.  Exercise assessment is a program for measuring operational effectiveness in each functional area and the crew as a whole in mission execution.  Data is collected by each element that takes part in an exercise.  The exercise debriefing log or any automated  tracking  program  can  be  used  to  record  data.    Proper  assessment  of  the  data collected  during  exercises  serve  as  a  basis  for  identifying  execution  trends,  deficiencies, operational weaknesses, and other areas that need more training.  Post-exercise debriefings, attended by key simulation team personnel, are used during the exercise assessment phase as a means for identifying those areas that need more training. A7.11.4.  Exercise  Conduct.    The  briefing,  conduct,  and  debriefing  are  the  three  required functions  to  support  the  training  requirements  for  an  MTE  to  advance  MEC  skills  and knowledge. SECTION A7C— A7.12.  General.  The MTE provides a way to train unit personnel and may be conducted either independently  or  in  conjunction  with  other  elements  of  the  TACS  and  CAF.    Through  the repetitive use of MTEs, simulated scenarios are set up in a realistic interactive environment that develops  the skills  of Airmen to  execute flawlessly without  hesitation in  situations likely to  be encountered in real tactical operations.  Personnel taking part in these MTEs clearly understand their duties. A7.13.  Training Objectives.  The training objectives for the CRC MTEs are to: A7.13.1.  Execute MECs effectively in a Joint Tactical Air Operations (JTAO) battlespace. 86 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 A7.13.2.  Provide  training  in  the  collection,  transmission,  receipt  and  processing  of operational and intelligence reports. A7.13.3.  Direct the decentralized execution of air operations, to include both defensive and offensive mission activities. A7.13.4.  Perform weapons control functions, as directed by the AOC/CRC. A7.13.5.  Conduct the collection, display, evaluation, and reporting/telling of air surveillance information. A7.13.6.  Coordinate and interface the identification function with other operations elements in the accomplishment of the classification function. A7.13.7.  Coordinate  defensive  actions  through  the  ADAFCO  to  the  associated  ADA  Fire Direction Center (FDC). A7.13.8.  Interpret and publish supplemental prearranged Operational Data (OPDAT) in US Message Text Format (USMTF). A7.13.9.  Provide link interface training of both internal and external circuits in the execution of the OPTASK LINK. A7.13.10.  Exercise the processing and exchange of the simulated link data. A7.14.  MTE  Scheduling.    The  ACS  DO  is  ultimately  responsible  for  the  scheduling  of  all MTEs.    The  DO  may  delegate  MTE  scheduling  duties  to  the  Operation  Plans  and  Exercises branch.  552 ACG units coordinate MTE participation through 752 OSS/OSO;  other units may use PEX or other MAJCOM approved scheduling tools to schedule participation in DMO events.  The intermediate headquarters when necessary will assist in the coordination and support for the units during larger virtual exercises if needed. (T-3). A7.15.  Mission Crew Leader Responsibilities.  The mission crew leader (usually MCC or SD) is  responsible  for  preparing  the  crew  to  complete  the  MTEs  using  the  briefing  and  debriefing guides. A7.16.  Simulation  Team  (White  Cell)  Responsibilities.    The  team  is  to  portray  the  various external  agencies  and  information  sources  that,  for  reason  of  practicality  or  economy,  do  not actively take part in the MTE. A7.16.1.  The  team  coordinates  requirements  and  actions  among  the  exercise  participants.  Members  are  selected  for  their  knowledge  and  experience  in  the  areas  and  functions  to  be simulated. A7.16.2.  The  team,  under  the  guidance  of  the  Simulation  Supervisor  (for  smaller  training events) or the Exercise Director (for larger or full crew training events), plan and execute a MSEL in order to facilitate the flow of events while ensuring all training objectives are being accomplished in an efficient manner. A7.16.3.  Prior  to  beginning  a  MTE,  the  team  members  assume  their  positions  and  check their  equipment  and  communications  for  proper  operation.    Following  the  exercise,  the simulation  team  collects  and  passes  all  pertinent  information  obtained  in  the  event  to  the Simulation Supervisor or the Exercise Director. AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 87 A7.16.4.  All simulation team members are to familiarize themselves with unit OIs for DMO prior to the event (if available). A7.17.  Exercise  Simulation.    External  agency  simulation  consists  of  those  inputs  that  would normally be received from non-participating agencies.  The following list describes the functions of some of the external agencies that may be simulated.  (Not all inclusive)  A7.17.1.  ADA  weapons  simulation  provides  for  the  input  of  Army  air  defense  weapons status information.   A7.17.2.  Pilot  simulation  is  performed  on  the  Instructor  Operator  Stations  (IOS)  with  the simulation drivers realistically responding to AWO/WD instructions. A7.17.3.  Wing  Operations  Center  (WOC)  simulation  personnel    perform  those  functions normally  done  by  the  operations  staff  at  various  air  base  WOCs.    The  simulation  team normally  performs  all  WOC  functions  during  MTEs.    During  warfighter  exercises  and Virtual  Flags,  a  White  Force  cell  at  705  CTS,  DMOC  or  other  distributed  locations  can provide WOC simulation for the exercise. A7.17.4.  Air Traffic Control (ATC) simulation  involves interaction between ATC agencies such  as  control  towers,  Federal  Aviation  Administration/International  Civil  Aviation Organization  (FAA/ICAO)  centers,  radar  approach  control  (RAPCON),  and  other  facilities which  process  flight  data.  In  some  instances,  multi-user  Internet  Relay  Chat  (i.e.,  mIRC, IWS, etc) or any instant messaging system may be used. A7.18.  Briefings and Debriefings.  MTE briefings and debriefings will be conducted IAW the procedures described in this instruction and AFI 13-1CRC Volume 3. (T-3).  SECTION A7D— Figure A7.1. Sample MTE CAT III After Action Report.

Effective Simulation Team by providing accurate and neutral information about system and crew performance in presentations. 88 AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015  c.  Effectively set up under field conditions at deployed location.  d.  Pre-Briefing, Execution Briefing and Debriefing accomplished IAW AFI 13-1CRC Vol. 3  e.  Effective Simulation cells, including AOC, and pilots.  2.  Training Goals Obtained.  Overall the XXX met our training goals.  There was effective flow of information throughout each unit and into the UCC.  Communications were a problem initially, but were operational for 75% of the exercise and data links were operational for 75% of the exercise.  100% of Operations personnel present were on position for at least one MTE.  The Simulation cell and Maintenance branch did an outstanding job.  3.  Standardization/Evaluation Goals Obtained:  XXX ACS:  4 INIT.  4.  Exercise Observations.  a.  Subject:  MTE fidelity circuit testing  (1)  Discussion:  On 10 June, the fidelity check for the MTE was never specified this in the tasking message.  (2)  Lessons Learned:  Allow more time for testing when in the field.  The tasking message did not specify on-site testing times for the units.  This needs to be specified in the tasking message and clearly communicated to all sections during the pre-MTE conference calls.  (3)  Recommendation:  Allow more time for testing when deploying in the field.  Ensure the exercise tasking letter specifies the onsite and offsite testing times, and ensure everyone agrees to it, during the pre-MTE conference calls.  (4)  Follow Up POC:  Capt XXXXX, MTPO DSN XXX-XXX  b.  Subject:  ATO   (1)  Discussion:  The ATO did not correlate with segment 3 on our HD.  (2)  Lesson Learned:  We pre-tested segment 1 and the ATO correlated.  However we never pre-tested segment 3.  We need to pre-test the segment we intend to use prior to the MTE.  (3)  Recommendation:  Pre-test all segments prior to the MTE.  Follow up with other units and USAFE to determine if there is an accurate ATO for this segment.  (4)  Follow Up POC:  Capt XXXXX, MTPO DSN XXX-XXX  AFI13-1CRCV1  13 OCTOBER 2015 89 c.  Subject:  Crew Briefing.  (1)  Discussion:  There was no briefing prior to the second MTE event for Segment 3 (post hostilities).  This caused confusion within the crew, especially with the ID of hostile aircraft.  (2)  Lesson Learned:  Either brief both segments before we go on position, or preferably allow more time between scenario runs to allow for separate crew briefs.  (3)  Recommendation:  Allow more time between MTE segments runs for a separate briefing.  (4)  Follow-up POC: MCC, AST, SD, Capt XXXXX, MTPO DSN XXX-XXX  5.  Training impact:  The overall training value for this exercise was excellent.  Mission planning was effective and units were in constant contact throughout the months leading up to this MTE.  Required information was effectively passed between the OMs and the Unit Command Center and the participating units.  This allowed all units to effectively train at all positions.  6.  CRC Simulation Critique:  Review all aspects of the exercise areas and critique each area.  Through good feedback the exercise, exercise materials and performance can be improved to meet the operational requirement.  7.
