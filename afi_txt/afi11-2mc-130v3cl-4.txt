If the drop must be made, use 0% flaps and expect longer than normal release time.     NOTE:  If aircraft gross weight exceeds 120,000 pounds use the  140  KCAS  flap  setting  chart.    EXCEPTION:    For combination  drops  above  120,000  pounds  use  130  KCAS and the 130 KCAS flap setting chart. 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 37 40 43 46 49   34 AFI 11-2MC-130 V3 CL4 2 APRIL 2015 Slowdown Checklist 1.  “SLOWDOWN NOW” (N) 2.
