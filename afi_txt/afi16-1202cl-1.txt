Check for any leaks in the regulator bylistening for the sound of escaping airDive Equipment Checklist202AFI 16-1202, CL-1  1 November 2002NOTE:  If a leak is suspected, determine the exact locationby submerging the valve assembly and the regulator in atank of water and watch for escaping bubbles.NOTE:  Frequently the problem can be traced to animproperly seated regulator and is corrected by closing thevalve, bleeding the regulator, detaching and reseating.  Ifthe leak is at the O-ring and reseating does not solve theproblem, replace the O-ring and check again for leaks.2.5.  Life Preserver/Buoyancy Compensator (BC)2.5.1.  Orally inflate preserver to check for leaks andthen squeeze out all air.NOTE:  The remaining gas should be removed after entryinto the water by rolling onto the back and depressing theoral inflation tube just above the surface.WARNING:  Never suck the air out, as it may containexcessive carbon dioxide.2.5.2.  Inspect the carbon dioxide cartridges to ensurethey have not been used (seals intact) and are theproper size for the vest being used and for the depthof dive.2.5.3.

After the jumper clears the aircraft, turn to observe theaccuracy of the drop.a. The normal flight pattern will be a rectangular orracetrack pattern with the final approach from WDI totarget.  Each leg of the pattern must be long enough toallow the JM and jumpers the preparation needed prior todeployment.(1) For high performance aircraft, the turn to thecrosswind leg will be made as soon as possible after theWDI is released.  A pattern with crosswind and baselegs of not over one half minute and with downwindFixed Target Procedures264AFI 16-1202, CL-1                1 November 2002and final legs of 1 to 1 ½ minutes will allow time forheading corrections on final.  This allows the JM timeto observe the descent of WDI device or jumpers.  If adelay is expected, another full pattern should be flown,as opposed to extending the downwind leg, thismaintains the aircraft close to the area for continuedevaluation.  This pattern will place the aircraft amaximum of 5 minutes from the site at any one time.(2) The aircraft will be flown over the target at apredetermined altitude and airspeed.  When directlyover the target a minimum of one WDI will be dropped.The JM and aircrew will make every effort to keep theWDI in sight from release to impact.  Over land, thepilot may have to circle over the WDI to ensure thedefinite location of , or orientation to the impact pointto the target.  After the first WDI has reached theground and its position NOTEd, the aircraft will returnto the normal pattern.  The final approach should passdirectly over the WDI and the intended target, in thatorder.  This pattern automatically aligns the finalapproach into the wind.(3)A right or left hand pattern may be flown dependingon terrain and aircraft configuration.  The aircraft willbe flown in this pattern with minor course correctionson final.  As the aircraft passes directly over the firstWDI, the JM will start a uniform count to measure thetime from the WDI to the target.  When the aircraft isover the target, the count will be stopped andFixed Target Procedures265AFI 16-1202, CL-1                1 November 2002immediately a new count will begin, when that countequals the first, the second WDI or jumper will bedeployed.  The increasing count will measure the samedistance past the target with the accuracy of thedeployment dependent upon the JMs alignment andcount.Fixed Target Procedures266AFI 16-1202, CL-1                1 November 2002MOVING TARGET PROCEDURESMoving Target Procedures267AFI 16-1202, CL-1                1 November 2002   1.  MOVING TARGET PROCEDURESa.  Head directly toward the target, regardless of the winddirection.b.  Release the spotter chute directly over the target.c.  Immediately upon release, make a left/right hand turnto observe the descent and position of the spotter chute.d.  Establish rectangular drop pattern oriented so the finalapproach will be aligned with the spotter chute and thetarget, respectively.  The pattern should be adjusted sothat the aircraft will be over the target five to nineminutes after the spotter chute is deployed.e.  Turn on approach.  Make minor changes in heading topass over the spotter chute and the target on a direct line.Aircraft drift correction should be established prior topassing over the spotter chute.  Initiate a uniform countover the spotter chute.f.  Reverse count over the target.g.  Deploy PJs when the last digit in reverse count isreached.h.  After the jumper clears the aircraft, turn to observe theaccuracy of the drop.i.  Deploy additional jumpers using the drop heading andcount established in steps 5, 6, and 7.j.  Disregard the spotter chute for subsequent passes.k.  When the target drift rate is changed (drogue chute isinstalled on target, know wind shift occurs, etc.) theentire spotter chute procedure must be re-accomplishedMoving Target Procedures268AFI 16-1202, CL-1                1 November 2002and a new drop heading and count established startingwith step 1.2  MOVING TARGET PATTERN.  Deploymentprocedures to a moving target are similar to thoseemployed for a stationary target.  The moving targetprocedures takes into consideration target drift and willplace the team on the downdrift line of the moving targetand not necessarily on target.  Special attention should bepaid to the following items:a. The pattern must be adjusted so that the initial passover the target after WDI deployment is not less than 5minutes and not more than 9 minutes, 7 minutes beingideal.  If the initial pattern requires more than 9 minutes,the team will be too far downdrift/downwind and with ahigh target drift rate may not be able to locate the targetvisually.b. On the initial pass after the WDI deployment, anaccurate count can be obtained by the JM and the headingnoted by both the JM and pilot.  All subsequent passeswill be made on this initial heading using the countobtained on the first pass.  No attempt should be made torecheck the count or change the initial heading becausethe target will have drifted.NOTE:  On subsequent passes requiring a change ofheading to place the aircraft over the target, ensure the pilotcorrects back to original heading.  Moving targetprocedures are normally conducted from fixed-wingaircraft.Moving Target Procedures269AFI 16-1202, CL-1                1 November 2002CROSSWIND PROCEDURESCrosswind Procedures.1.  Spotting and Aerial Delivery - Crosswind Procedures.a.  Fly over target on heading in a direction to permit aleft/right hand pattern.b.  Release the spotter chute/streamer directly over target.c.  Accomplish a 180 degree turn (terrain permitting) indirection of drift and observe distance of spotterchute/streamer from target.Crosswind Procedures270AFI 16-1202, CL-1                1 November 2002d.  Make another 180 degree turn to place the aircraft onthe approach leg the same distance upwind from thetarget as the spotter chute is downwind.e.  Deploy PJs, equipment or additional spotterschutes/streamers (as required) just prior to when theaircraft is in direct line with the target and spotterchute/streamer.   2.  Crosswind pattern.  A crosswind pattern may berequired by terrain conditions or possible sun reflection onthe waters surface.  The pilot and JM must accurately judgethe upwind distance from the target in order for thistechnique to be effective.  The easiest method for obtainingan accurate upwind distance is the utilization of areference/release point.  It is imperative that the jumpers bedeployed prior to reaching the reference point due to theforward ballistics of the parachute as opening occurs.  Theobjective is to place the reference point at the center of thestick after forward throw is considered.3.  Spotting techniques.  Reference points may be used onall JMD land deployments.  The utilization of referencepoints will increase the JMs accuracy in determining theproper release point.  Also an established reference/releasepoint will allow the aircraft to be flown in any direction aslong as it will pass over the reference/release point.  Thesepoints are a necessity when accomplishing a crosswind orCrosswind Procedures271AFI 16-1202, CL-1                1 November 2002downwind deployment pattern.  The correct method forestablishing e reference/release point is:a. Upon completion of the initial over the target WDIdeployment, establish the impact location of the WDI.b. Pick out a spot that is an equal distance on the oppositeside of the target as the WDI.  This spot can be anyreadily identifiable feature, i.e. discolored ground,bushes, trees, etc.NOTE:  The JM should pass the reference/release point tothe pilot to assure that both are utilizing the same point ofreferenceRICHARD A.
