Purpose.  This instruction outlines and explains the capabilities Air Force Bands employ to accomplish  a  wide  range  of  objectives  around  the  world.  It  provides  commanders  and  Public Affairs (PA) professionals the guidance to use the unique ability of music to bridge language and cultural  differences  to  build  relationships  with  a  wide  variety  of  audiences  and  communicate  a broader,  deeper  sense  of  meaning  behind  their  ideas  and  messages.  Implementing  Air  Force Policy  Directive  (AFPD)  35-1,  Public  Affairs  Management,  this  document  describes  Air  Force Bands,  explains  how  they  are  functionally  organized,  and  outlines  their  capabilities  and activities. 1.2.  Application.  The  guidance  in  this  publication  is  authoritative.  When  complying  with official  policy,  guidance,  and/or  procedures,  the  unit  may  request  a  waiver.  Each  compliance item  is  identified  by  a  tier  level  in  parenthesis.  See  AFI  33-360,  Publications  and  Forms Management,  for  more  information  on  tier  levels,  waiver  authorities,  and  the  waiver  process. Individual conduct, official programs, and daily activities within Air Force Bands should always be accomplished lawfully and ethically. If conflicts arise between the content of this publication and Department of Defense guidance, higher level guidance takes precedence for the activities of joint forces unless the Secretary of Defense has provided more current and specific guidance. 1.3.  Air Force Band Mission.  Air Force Bands provide a wide spectrum of musical support for events that enhance the morale, motivation, and esprit de corps of our Airmen, foster public trust and support, aid recruiting initiatives, and promote our national interests at home and abroad. 1.4.  Air Force Band Core Competencies.  Four Band core competencies provide the vision for senior leaders to use the effects of music to accomplish the Air Force mission at home, overseas, and  in  an  expeditionary  environment.  These  are  the  fundamental  competencies  of  Air  Force Bands  and  directly  relate  to  their  primary  missions.  Their  strong  linkage  to  the  overarching Public  Affairs  competencies  serves  as  a  foundation  for  the  synergistic  integration  of  all  Public Affairs  capabilities.  For  more  information,  refer  to  AFI  35-101,  Public  Affairs  Responsibilities and Management. 1.4.1.  Official  Representation.  Air  Force  Bands  serve  as  official  representatives  of  the United States and the United States Air Force in the presentation of formal musical honors in state events and military ceremonies. 1.4.2.  Airman Morale and Readiness. Airman morale and readiness is the foundation of all Air  Force  core  competencies.  Bands  provide  Air  Force  leaders  an  effective  and  efficient means of building, maintaining, and strengthening morale and readiness. 1.4.3.  Public Trust and Support. Public trust and support are fundamental to a highly trained and well-equipped air, space, and cyberspace force. Bands strengthen the bonds between the Air  Force  and  the  public  through  a  wide  range  of  events  designed  to  engage  communities, opinion leaders, and the media. 1.4.4.  Global Influence and Deterrence. Bands directly affect international perceptions of the United  States  and  the  Air  Force  through  musical  events  designed  to  engage  audiences  of strategic  value.  Bands  partner  with  Headquarters  (HQ)  or  Major  Command  (MAJCOM) AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 7 International  Affairs  (IA)  directorates  to  develop  and  implement  engagement  strategies toward  building  partnerships  and  opening  lines  of  communication  with  international audiences. Such actions enhance support from  allies, and build and strengthen relationships with potential international partners. 1.5.  Air  Force  Band  Core  Functions.  Air  Force  Band  core  competencies  are  supported  and enabled  by  five  core  functions.  These  functions  enable  Bands  to  effectively  perform  their primary  mission  and  assist  Air  Force  leaders  in  creating  desired  effects  intended  for  key audiences. 1.5.1.  Ceremonial:  Air Force Bands create and convey a profound sense of dignity at state events and official military ceremonies and functions by rendering appropriate and required musical  honors  to  our  nation  and  our  Airmen.  Bands  create  this  dignity  through  the professionalism and quality of their music, drill, and Air Force image. 1.5.2.  Communication: Air Force  Bands design  and execute musical  events  which serve as communication platforms and facilitate the effective delivery of key messages to audiences. Band leadership teams expertly combine diverse communication methods to ensure priority messages are delivered in the most effective way. 1.5.3.  Engagement:  Air Force Bands represent the professionalism and commitment of the United  States  Air  Force  with  the  exceptional  quality  of  their  musical  performance,  diverse array of musical styles, and Air Force image. Performances are designed to capture and hold the attention, interest, and admiration of key audiences. 1.5.4.  Building  Partnerships:    Air  Force  Bands  actively  design  a  wide  variety  of  musical events  to  bridge  language  and  cultural  differences  to  engage,  inform,  entertain,  and  uplift audiences.  Bands  perform  the  right  music  for  the  right  event  and  utilize  performing  styles and techniques which establish a sense of commonality and community with key audiences. 1.5.5.  Organize, Train and Equip:  Air Force Bands ensure the military readiness and ability to deploy of Airman Musicians. 1.6.  Air Force Band Objectives.  The Air Force conducts comprehensive, active Public Affairs activities  at  all  levels  of  command  to  provide  audiences  with  information  contributing  to awareness and understanding of the Air Force’s mission. As a key capability of Public Affairs, music can be used to enhance the communication process and enable Air Force leaders to convey a  broader,  deeper  sense  of  meaning  behind  their  ideas  and  messages.  With  this  capability  in mind, Bands design operations to: 1.6.1.  Render  musical  honors  on  behalf  of  the  United  States  and  the  Air Force  to  our  flag, national leaders, allies, guests, and Airmen in official state and military events as required, to include  State  Funerals,  Presidential  Inaugurations,  White  House  and  Pentagon  arrival ceremonies, Changes of Command, and military funerals. 1.6.2.  Build, maintain, and strengthen the morale, esprit de corps, and readiness of Airmen in the Continental United States (CONUS), outside the Continental United States (OCONUS), and at forward deployed locations. 1.6.3.  Synergize Band capabilities and the effects of music with the capabilities and effects of  the  broader  Public  Affairs  community  to  increase  the  effectiveness  of  Air  Force communication. 8 AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 1.6.4.  Increase public awareness and understanding of the bravery, sacrifice, and dedication of  Airmen;  the  importance  of  airpower;  and  the  mission,  policies  and  heritage  of  the  Air Force. 1.6.5.  Create, maintain, and strengthen relationships with a variety of audiences to enhance the  reputation  of  the  Air  Force  as  a  good  neighbor  and  as  a  respected,  professional organization charged with an integral role in maintaining U.S. national security. 1.6.6.  Create,  maintain,  and  strengthen  relationships  with  strategic  international  audiences, using music to bridge cultural, societal, and socio-economic differences. 1.6.7.  Aid Air Force recruiting by supporting recruiting service events and initiatives. 1.7.  The Use of Music in the Communication Process.  Band events play a key role in the Air Force  communication  process.  Each  event  is  an  opportunity  to  engage  and  interact  with  a particular  audience  on  behalf  of  the  Air  Force  and  is  planned  and  structured  to  maximize  the effectiveness  and  impact  of  the  message  being  delivered.  Airman  musicians  deliver  the  right message at the right time to the right  audience, even if the message is delivered through music alone. Bands facilitate the use of music in the communication process in the following ways: 1.7.1.  Band  Leadership.  Integrate  the  work  of  Band  Operations  and  Band  Publicity  in support of senior leader objectives, and serve as a liaison between the Band and other Public Affairs teams throughout the Band’s geographic area of responsibility (AOR). 1.7.2.  Band Operations.  Maximize the use of effects-based planning to  ensure Band events are aligned with Air Force, MAJCOM, and wing priorities. 1.7.2.1.  Public  Affairs  Partnerships.  Establish  and  maintain  an  aggressive,  interactive relationship  with  supported  combatant  commands,  MAJCOM,  and  wing  Public  Affairs staffs  in  the  Band’s  geographic  AOR  with  the  goal  of  synergizing  capabilities  to  reach communication goals more effectively. 1.7.3.  Band  Publicity.  Facilitate  the  Band’s  participation  in  the  Air  Force  communication process.  Band Publicity  should be actively  engaged in  the following  four  areas, and should coordinate  these  efforts  with  MAJCOM  and  wing  Public  Affairs  staffs  in  their  AOR  as appropriate: 1.7.3.1.  Graphic  Media:  In  coordination  and  partnership  with  host  wing  Public  Affairs, design and create graphic media products such as posters, artwork for recordings, concert programs, and other such products which help support Air Force Band performances and audition opportunities. 1.7.3.2.  Social Media: Utilize a wide variety of Social Media to enhance engagement and communication goals and optimize resources. 1.7.3.3.  Multimedia: In coordination and partnership with AFPAA and host wing Public Affairs, help integrate the effects of music into the mission of the broader Public Affairs community  and  assist  in  creating  multimedia  products  designed  to  tell  the  Air  Force story. 1.7.3.4.  Print and Broadcast Media: Engage and seek coverage from print and broadcast media to expand the reach and effectiveness of Band operations. AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 9 1.7.4.  Integration.  Ensure  all  levels  of  Band  personnel  understand  the  role  of  music  in  the communication process and the role of Airman Musicians within Public Affairs. 1.7.5.  Band Recordings.

Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  CONUS Air Force Bands operate in geographic AORs as assigned by SAF/PA and the ANG. OCONUS Air Force Bands operate in geographic AORs as assigned by PACAF and USAFE. Figure 5.1. shows the AORs for active duty Bands and Figure 5.2. shows the AORs for ANG Bands. Coverage of any OCONUS AORs not assigned to a Band should be provided for in accordance with paragraph 6.6. and sub-paragraphs, or via a Request For  Forces  (RFF).    For  events  in  Canada,  Mexico,  and  the  Bahamas,  Military  Department Headquarters will determine support eligibility and forward to United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) to determine if the event will be favorably considered.  Puerto Rico belongs to USAF Band of the West, Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, AOR. 5.2.  Support  to  MAJCOMs  .  Subject  to  the  guidance  in  section  6  of  this  AFI,  Bands  may support official or unofficial military events outside their AOR which are directly sponsored by their MAJCOM. The event should be sufficiently important to the MAJCOM to warrant support from  a  non-local  Band  asset  and  Bands  should  ensure  the  support  is  provided  with  fiscal prudence.  Limited  support  to  public  events  in  conjunction  is  permissible  to  ensure  that  the itinerary includes a full schedule of performances, and to increase overall cost-effectiveness. For example,  if  the  itinerary  has  military  events  on  Monday  and  Wednesday,  then  the  Band  may support a public event on Tuesday; however, the Band should not extend their stay to perform a public event  on Thursday. The requirements outlined in  paragraphs  5.3. and sub-paragraphs do not  apply  these  MAJCOM  sponsored,  external  AOR  events.  Bands  should  coordinate  with  the primary Band assigned to that AOR and inform SAF/PAB. 5.3.  Events  Outside  a  Band’s  AOR  . To support military or civilian sponsored public events outside  their  AOR,  Bands  must  follow  guidance  set  forth  in  DoDI  5410.19,  Public  Affairs Community Relations Policy Implementation. (T-0) At least 30 days prior to the event, provide written  confirmation  of  the  following  to  SAF/PAB,  or  the  Chief,  ANG  Bands  as  appropriate, along  with  the  official  request  (AFORS  number  or  DD  Form  2536),  the  itinerary  and  a  non-availability  statement  from  the  primary  Band  assigned  to  cover  the  AOR.  Due  to  proximity, USAF  Heartland  of  America  Band  is  authorized  to  support  Air  Force  bases,  missile  facilities, and  communities  in  North  and  South  Dakota,  per  coordination  and  approval  from  The  USAF Academy Band. Bands may also combine assets to perform missions that cross AORs. All other events outside a Band’s designated AOR will meet the following criteria: (T-1) 5.3.1.  Support is in the best interest of the Air Force. 5.3.2.  No similar military asset local to the event is available to meet the request. 5.3.3.  No other military Band assets are participating in the event. If other military Bands are participating in the event, all participation is in accordance with the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs (OATSD(PA)) Memorandum,  Interim Guidance for  Military  Participation  in  Parades  and  Civic  Celebrations,  7  March  2012,  or  in accordance with an approved exception to policy from the OATSD(PA). 5.3.4.  All opportunities for local area public concerts within the AOR have been met before accepting requests outside the AOR. AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 27 5.3.5.  No invitations from within the AOR are being declined to allow the unit to accept the invitation outside the AOR. 5.3.6.  The itinerary includes a full schedule of performances. 5.3.7.  Support  is  at  no  additional  cost  to  the  government  beyond  the  unit’s  programmed O&M funds for community relations. 5.4.  CONUS-Wide  Missions  for  The  USAF  Band  and  The  USAF  Academy  Band.  Due to their national missions, when The USAF Band or The USAF Academy Band performs in another Band’s  AOR,  they  should  begin  coordination  with  that  Band  at  least  6  months  in  advance  in order  to  deconflict  locations  with  local  operations.  The  USAF  Band  and  The  USAF  Academy Band should provide courtesy copies of proposed itineraries to the Band and to SAF/PAB at least 30 days in advance. 5.5.  The  Office  of  the  Assistant  to  the  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Public  Affairs (OATSD(PA))  identifies  the  specific  CONUS  area  five-year  schedule  for  use  by  the  National Capital Region (NCR) based military Bands to include The Air Force Band.

General Guidance. 6.1.1.  SAF/PAB  manages  all  issues  related  to  performance  guidance  for  Air  Force  Bands. Strategic oversight of active duty Band operations rests with the assigned MAJCOM, DRU, or wing Headquarters of each Band. Strategic oversight of ANG Band operations rests with the respective DRU or wing. 6.1.2.  To  ensure  MAJCOM,  DRU,  or  wing  Band  objectives  are  codified,  aligned,  and prioritized, Bands should maximize the use of effects-based targeting in  the construction of their  operational  plans.  In  addition,  planning  should  involve  representatives  from  Public Affairs,  Air  Force  Recruiting,  Protocol,  and  other  agencies  as  appropriate.  Effects-based targeting should be ongoing in order to continually identify and assess priority missions. 6.1.3.  In order to build trust and maintain strong relationships with each Public Affairs and protocol  office  within  their  AOR,  Bands  should  proactively  reach  out  to  military  sponsors, Public Affairs offices, and protocol offices regarding developing and recurring requirements. 6.1.4.  In  order  to  deconflict  schedules  and  promote  partnership  between  active  duty  and ANG  Bands,  scheduling  representatives  should  provide  each  other  with  regular,  ongoing feedback regarding operational and strategic planning. 6.2.  Department  of  Defense  Authority.  DoDD  5410.18  and  DoDI  5410.19  establish  policies for military Bands to perform at certain events, ceremonies, broadcasts, and other activities in the civilian  community.    Bands  must  coordinate  OATSD(PA)  approval  through  SAF/PAB  to participate in: 6.2.1.  Any  public  event  that  results  in  additional  cost  to  the  Air  Force  beyond  the  unit’s programmed O&M funds for community relations. (T-0) 6.2.2.  Any  event  where  more  than  one  military  Band  is  requested  to  perform,  unless participation is in accordance with OATSD/PA memorandum Interim Guidance for Military Participation in Parades and Civic Celebrations, 7 March 2012 . (T-0) 6.2.3.  Public  events  in  the  NCR  (regional  and  ANG  Bands  only).  (T-0)  The  USAF  Band coordinates with the Military District of Washington (MDW). 6.2.4.  Events  of  international  or  national  importance,  including  national  conventions  and meetings. (T-0) 6.2.5.  National sports and professional athletic events within the United States. (T-0) 6.2.6.  National television or radio events and programs. (T-0) 6.2.7.  Any request made for CONUS based Bands for OCONUS events. (T-0)  For events in Canada,  Mexico,  and  the  Bahamas,  Military  Department  Headquarters  will  determine support  eligibility  and  forward  to  USNORTHCOM  to  determine  if  the  event  will  be favorably considered. 6.3.  Participation  Guidelines.  30 AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 6.3.1.  Rules for participation in public events. 6.3.1.1.  Bands must ensure that every event complies with public law and Department of Defense  (DoD)  policy,  by  ensuring  at  least  one  condition  in  each  of  the  authorized participation  criteria  categories  (activity,  sponsor,  site,  and  program)  listed  in  DoDI 5410.19, Enclosure 13 is met. (T-0) 6.3.1.2.  Air  Force  Bands  may  play  music  for  public  events  and  parades  which  are sponsored by corporate, private, or civic entities, when the sponsor’s role is clearly civic in nature and not political or commercial, the event  is of general interest or benefit to a local, state, or national community, and is free and open to the entire community. Band support  at  events  which  are  commercially  sponsored,  designed  to  increase  business traffic, or associated with a particular religious or ideological movement (e.g. Christmas parade  or  political  gathering),  or  would  trivialize  Air  Force  participation  (e.g.  beauty pageant) is not authorized. 6.3.1.3.  A religious facility is an authorized site for a public concert when the event is of community-wide interest, non-sectarian, and broadly promoted.  Air Force Band concerts must  not  be  part  of  a  religious  service.    An  Air  Force  Band  performance  in  a  religious facility does not imply federal endorsement of any particular religion or ideology. 6.3.1.4.  Air  Force  Bands  may  perform  a  patriotic  opener  at  events  which  are  not supported with U.S. federal government funds and are not free to the public or not held on  a  military  base  (e.g.  civilian  sponsored  social,  civic,  cultural,  and  athletic  events). Refer  to  DoDD  5410.18  enclosure  2  paragraph  1.12  for  the  definition  of  a  patriotic opener. 6.3.1.5.  Air  Force  Bands  must  not  engage  in  the  performance  of  music  in  competition with local civilian musicians. (T-0) Refer to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs  Memorandum,  2010  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  (NDAA),  10  U.S.C. §974,  5  November  2009,  and  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Public  Affairs Memorandum,  Determination  of  Military  Band  Participation  in  Certain  Military  Relief Activities, 29 January 2010, for the definitions of performances in competition with local civilian musicians. 6.3.1.6.  Bands  may  perform  at  events  where  general  admission  is  charged  only  if  the Band’s  participation  is  incidental  to  the  primary  event  and  the  minimum  criteria  for activity,  sponsor,  site,  and  program  have  been  met  as  outlined  in  DoDI  5410.19 Enclosure  13  Evaluation  Checklist  (e.g.  county  or  state  fairs,  festivals,  exhibitions).  No additional  charge  may  be  imposed  to  hear  the  Band  play.  Refer  to  DoDD  5410.18, paragraph  4.1.4.  and  sub-paragraphs,  and  E2.1.14.  for  the  descriptions  of  incidental support. Until such time as new guidance is issued by the OATSD(PA), the definition of music  allowable  under  incidental  support  is  limited  to  DoDD  5410.18,  paragraph E2.1.12. 6.3.1.7.  Guidance for support of charitable fund-raising activities hosted or sponsored by non-Federal entities is governed by DoD 5500.07-R, Joint Ethics Regulation. In general, Air  Force  Bands  do  not  provide  support  to  fundraising  events,  except  as  authorized  by Title  5  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  2635  (Standards  of  Conduct)  section 2635.808,  the  Joint  Ethics  Regulation,  and  by  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 31 Public  Affairs  Memorandum,  Determination  of  Military  Band  Participation  in  Certain Military  Relief  Activities,  29  January  2010.  Providing  support  at  charitable  fund-raising events by military service members in uniform, or while performing in a military Band, choral group, or portion thereof, is inappropriate because it may convey in that context a strong visual appearance of endorsement of the non-Federal entity, its event, or its goals. For more information, contact your local legal office or SAF/PAB. 6.3.1.8.  Air  Force  Bands  are  expected  to  perform  concert  tours  and  other  concerts  in traditional settings as part of their community outreach efforts. 6.3.1.9.  As  Appropriated  Fund  activities,  Air  Force  Bands  are  not  authorized  to  accept commercial sponsorship as outlined in AFI 34-108, Commercial Sponsorship and Sale of Advertising.  Co-sponsorship  of  civic  events  in  accordance  with  DoDI  5410.20,  Public Affairs  Relations  with  Business  and  Nongovernmental  Organizations  Representing Business,  and  the  Joint  Ethics  Regulation  is  authorized.  Coordinate  any  questions  with your local legal office or SAF/PAB. 6.3.2.  Rules for participation in Department of Defense events. 6.3.2.1.  Bands  are  authorized  to  support,  subject  to  5  CFR  Part  2635  (Standards  of Conduct)  and  the  Joint  Ethics  Regulation,  all  musical  requirements  at  official  United States Government events, on or off military installations, which are supported, in whole or in part, by United States Government funds. 6.3.2.2.  Bands  are  authorized  to  support,  subject  to  5  CFR  Part  2635  (Standards  of Conduct)  and  the  Joint  Ethics  Regulation,  all  musical  requirements  at  traditional,  yet unofficial,  military  sponsored  events  (e.g.  dining-in  and  out,  awards  banquets,  holiday parties, military balls, etc.) on or off military installations, held only for service members, service  members  and  their  immediate  families,  or  service  members,  their  immediate families  and  guests.  Support  for  unofficial  events  held  solely  or  primarily  for  family members is not authorized. 6.3.2.3.  Support  to  Non-appropriated  Fund  Instrumentalities  (NAFIs).  Air  Force  Bands are authorized to perform in NAFI facilities for events as described in paragraphs 6.3.2.1. and  6.3.2.2.  Otherwise,  Air  Force  Bands  are  not  authorized  to  perform  for  events sponsored by revenue-generating NAFIs. 6.3.2.4.  Air  Force  Reserve  Officer  Training  Corps  (ROTC)  and  Junior  ROTC  events. Bands  may  support  Air  Force  ROTC  and  Junior  ROTC  ceremonial  events  and  military balls  as  described  in  paragraphs.  6.3.2.1.  and  6.3.2.2.,  provided  these  events  are  for ROTC  cadets,  faculty  members,  and  guests.  Band  Operation  and  Maintenance  (O&M) funds may be used to pay for Band transportation and per diem expenses. 6.3.2.5.  Civil  Air  Patrol  annual  ceremonial  events  may  be  supported  as  outlined  in paragraph 6.3.2.1., provided they have an active duty sponsor. 6.3.2.6.  Funding  and  transportation  costs  should  be  paid  by  DoD  sponsors  for  events outside  the  Band’s  AOR.  Funding  and  transportation  costs  are  the  obligation  of  DoD sponsors  for  events  within  the  AOR  if  the  request  comes  after  all  resources  have  been allocated. 6.3.3.  Gifts to Benefit Military Musical Units 32 AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 6.3.3.1.  In accordance with AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force, and 10 U.S.C.  §  974(d)  as  amended  by  §  351  of  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for Fiscal  Year  2014,  Air  Force  Bands  are  authorized  to  accept  gifts  under  specific conditions.  The only gifts that may be considered are contributions of cash instruments (gift  cards  and  checks,  but  not  cash  in  the  form  of  currency)  and  personal  property  or services for the benefit  of an Air Force musical  unit.  Solicitation  of gifts  is  prohibited.  Bands  must  coordinate  with  SAF/PAB  before  accepting  any  gifts.    (T-1)  Note  that  the provision  of  a  performance  venue  and  associated  performance  support  services  by  a requestor are not considered a gift. 6.3.3.2.  Air  Force  Bands  submit  a  report  to  SAF/PAB  for  all  gifts  accepted  during  the fiscal  year.    The  report  identifies  the  Acceptance  Authority  or  designated  official, description of the gift, value of the gift, valuation method used, name and address of the donor,  date  the  gift  was  received,  statement  identifying  the  benefit  of  the  gift,  and  any additional  relevant  details.    In  addition,  any  gifts  that  are  rejected  by  Acceptance Authorities are documented to include the reason for the rejection.  SAF/PAB submits a consolidated report to the Secretary of the Air Force, who submits the report to Congress at the end of each fiscal year, no later than January 30. 6.3.4.  Manning Assists. Bands should first make every effort to utilize Active Duty, Reserve, or  Guard  military  musicians  for  performances  or  recordings.  When  a  military  musician cannot  fill  the  temporary  vacancy  for  an  upcoming  performance  or  recording,  a  civilian musician's  services  may  be  contracted  and  paid  for  using  O&M  funds  for  community outreach  performances  and  recordings.    The  amount  paid  to  the  civilian  musician  should reflect the fair market value of the musician’s services in order to prevent any ethics or gift issues.    This  authority  is  limited  by  applicable  fiscal  guidance  requiring  that  the  use  of appropriated funds be reasonable and necessary to fulfill the Air Force Band mission. 6.4.  Official  Performances  by Air  Force  Personnel  Outside the 3N1XX or 3N2XX Career Field. 6.4.1.  Official  military  musical  performances  that  could  garner  national  media  attention (e.g.,  singing  the  National  Anthem  at  a  sporting  event)  should  be  performed  by  an  airman who holds the 3N1XX or 3N2XX AFSC.  On a case-by-case basis, service members who do not  hold  the  3N1XX  or  3N2XX  AFSC  who  volunteer  or  are  solicited  to  perform  at  such events  must  be  approved  by  the  closest  military  Band  commander  or  SAF/PAB  prior  to accepting an invitation to perform in uniform.  (T-2)  Even if the service member volunteers to perform in civilian attire, if introduced as a member of the military, prior approval is still required.  Refer also to guidance in DoDI 5410.19. 6.4.2.  When the National Anthem is part of an official function and that function is receiving support  from  an  Air  Force  Band,  Airman  musicians  should  perform  the  National  Anthem.  Exceptions may be approved by the Band commander or chief enlisted manager. 6.5.  Requesting Band Performances. 6.5.1.  Except  as  noted  below,  all  requests  are  submitted  through  the  Air  Force  Outreach Request  System  (AFORS)  at  http://www.outreachrequests.hq.af.mil.  Civilian  sponsors should  submit  their  request  at  least  90  days  before  the  event.  Military  and  government sponsors should submit their request at least 60 days in advance for active duty Bands and 90 AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 33 days in advance for ANG Bands. Military and federal government personnel, in their official capacity, should not act on behalf of civilian sponsors to submit requests for events, as doing so could constitute a violation of the Joint Ethics Regulation. 6.5.1.1.  Sponsors  requesting  the  USAFE  Band,  the  USAF  Band  of  the  Pacific-Asia  or Air National  Guard Bands submit a DD Form 2536 (for public events), or other locally identified form (for military or government events), to the Director of Operations for each Band. 6.5.1.2.  Military  District  of  Washington  (MDW)  coordinates  all  requests  for  military Band  appearances  at  public  events  and  non-Air  Force  official  military  and  federal government  functions  within  the  NCR.  For  further  assistance  regarding  requests  within the NCR, please contact MDW at (202) 685-4990 or (202) 685-1072. 6.5.1.3.  Air  Force  requesters  within  the  NCR  do  not  need  to  coordinate  through  the MDW office and should contact The Air Force Band scheduler at 202-767-9253. 6.5.2.  In  accordance  with  AFI  34-501,  Mortuary  Affairs  Program,  when  a  Band  cannot provide  a  solo  bugler  for  a  funeral  ceremony,  the  Mortuary  Affairs  officer  is  authorized  to obtain a bugler from other authorized providers and pay using Mortuary Affairs O&M funds. Additional options are also outlined in AFI 34-501. 6.6.  OCONUS Band Support. 6.6.1.  The  Secretary  of  Defense  may  delegate  to  commanders  of  combatant  commands  the authority  to  approve  participation  in  public  events  overseas.  Overseas  MAJCOMs  should follow  guidance  as  prescribed  in  DoDD  5410.18  and  DoDI  5410.19  as  much  as  possible; however, the policy direction and guidance of their combatant command headquarters takes precedence.  Overseas  Bands  should  advise  SAF/PAB  when  they  participate  in  any  public event, recording, or video project that significantly affects their operations or requires major administrative,  financial,  or  logistical  support.  In  general,  Bands  ensure  all  performances comply  with  the  criteria  for  participation  in  public  events  outlined  in  paragraph  6.3.  and subparagraphs.  Restrictions regarding performances in  competition  with  civilian musicians do  not  apply  to  performances  outside  the  United  States,  its  commonwealths,  or  its possessions. 6.6.2.  Military  services  and  subordinate  commands  located  in  the  United  States  and  its territories  refer  all  requests  for  OCONUS  performances  by  CONUS-based  units  to  the appropriate combatant command or SAF/PAB. 6.6.3.  Requests for OCONUS performances by CONUS-based units may be approved only if: 6.6.3.1.  The combatant command evaluates the request and tasks in-theater assets if the request  meets  support  criteria.  If  no  in-theater  assets  are  available  and  the  event  is sufficiently important to warrant support, the combatant command forwards the request, with  its  recommendation  and  embassy  endorsement,  to  OATSD(PA)  for  evaluation  and approval. 6.6.3.2.  OATSD(PA)  evaluates  the  request  and,  if  approved,  forwards  it  to  the appropriate military service for action. 34 AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 6.6.4.  Approval procedure for Air National Guard Band OCONUS support differs from the above  only  in  that  combatant  commands  submit  their  requests  for  ANG  Band  support through National  Guard  Bureau-Public Affairs (NGB-PA). NGB-PA evaluates requests and submits its recommendation to OATSD(PA) for approval. 6.6.5.  Any  situation  not  covered  by  the  guidance  on  OCONUS  travel  of  musical  units stationed in the CONUS should immediately be brought to the attention of SAF/PAB. 6.7.  Band Reports. 6.7.1.  Active  duty  Bands,  except  as  noted  below,  will  ensure  their  events  in  AFORS  are closed-out by the 10th day of each month. (T-2) 6.7.1.1.  The  USAF  of  the  Pacific-Asia,  the  USAFE  Band,  and  the  AFCENT  Band  will submit  reports  of  monthly  Band  performances,  electronically  to  SAF/PAB,  by  the  10th day of each month. (T-2) In addition, the USAF Band of the Pacific-Asia and the United States  USAFE  Band  will  email  reports  of  projected  performances  to  SAF/PAB  by  the 25th day of each month. (T-2) 6.7.1.2.  The USAF Band will email reports of monthly Band performances to SAF/PAB by the 10th day of each month. (T-2) 6.7.2.  ANG Bands will record Band performances in the AFORS system as directed by the Chief,  ANG  Bands  (T-2)  In  addition,  ANG  Bands  will  submit  reports  of  noteworthy projected  performance  activities  to  the  Chief,  ANG  Bands  on  an  as-needed  basis.  (T-2) Examples  of  reported  events  should  include  any  nationally  televised  events  and  events supporting Armed Forces Day/Week, Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Veterans Day. AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 35 Chapter 7 STATE FUNERAL PLAN 7.1.  General  Guidance.  Active  duty  and  Air  National  Guard  Band  personnel  are  trained  and equipped to support the State Funeral Plan (SFP) as required by USNORTHCOM and Military District of Washington Joint Task Force National Capital Region (JTF-NCR). The USAF Band serves as the point of contact (POC) for all state funeral requirements involving Air Force Bands. 7.2.  Roles (The USAF Band). 7.2.1.  The USAF Band Commander is the officer in charge (OIC) and conductor for all SFP musical  support  provided  by  the  Air  Force  within  the  NCR.  The  USAF  Band  Director  of Operations is the alternate. 7.2.2.  The  USAF  Band  Chief  of  Operations  organizes,  develops,  and  executes  the  unit command  post  and  coordinates  all  operational  support  functions  needed  for  unit  execution during a state funeral to  include maintenance and 24-hour manning of open telephone lines for  the  direct  and  exclusive  communication  of  SFP  information.  The  command  post coordinates the return to the local area of Band personnel on leave or temporary duty (TDY), including documentation of travel entitlements. 7.2.3.  Performance personnel call the SFP Hotline for performance scheduling information. All  other  personnel  are  assigned  to  the  command  post.  Unit  Control  Center  (UCC)  staff releases a duty status roster to the command post and Ceremonial Brass operations personnel. The UCC and group leaders on TDY account for all members on TDY. If leave is interrupted due to official recall, personnel are eligible for entitlements as authorized in The Joint Travel Regulations. 7.3.  Roles (Active Duty and ANG Bands). 7.3.1.  Active duty regional Bands and Air National Guard Bands operate in support of The USAF Band during state funeral operations. Each Band has a primary and alternate SFP POC and  receives  guidance  from  The  USAF  Band.  The  regional  Band  commander  is  OIC  and conductor of assigned musical support provided by the Air Force outside of the NCR. 7.3.2.  Active duty regional Bands and Air National Guard Bands may be tasked to perform ceremonies (primary Band) or act as a support Band (primary support or secondary support Band.) 7.3.3.  Primary, primary support, and secondary support Bands follow local recall procedures to ensure a full accounting of all Band members. 7.3.4.  Upon  notification,  all  Band  members  of  tasked  and  supporting  Bands  report availability by calling their unit noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC.) All personnel are on permanent standby until released by local leadership. 36 AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 8 AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDINGS 8.1.  Audio Recording Projects. 8.1.1.  In  the  planning  stages  of  recording  projects,  Bands  coordinate  with  SAF/PAB.    Air National  Guard  Bands  coordinate  with  the  Chief,  ANG  Bands,  regarding  audio  recording projects. 8.1.2.  Coordination includes a short description of the strategy and content.  If the recording project  includes  packaging  and  distribution,  the  coordination  includes  an  overview  of  the graphic  design  (with  particular  attention  paid  to  the  required  elements  listed  in  par.  8.5. below) and the distribution plan. 8.2.  Video Recording Projects.  Policy guidance for video recordings is located in AFI 35-109, Visual Information. Depending on the type of video recording being created, requirements may vary  significantly  from  audio  recordings.  Early  coordination  with  the  installation  and/or MAJCOM Public Affairs offices or the Chief, ANG Bands, as appropriate, is highly encouraged to ensure all requirements are met. 8.3.  Social Media Use. in  AFI  35-107  Public  Web 8.3.1.  Policy  guidance  for  Social  Media Communications.  Air Force Bands develop an overall social media strategy with each post meeting  a  targeted  objective  and  an  established  set  of  standards  with  regards  to  dress  and appearance, content, and messaging.  It is imperative that Air Force Bands social media posts are targeted and deliberate, and the purpose of the post aligns with Air Force Bands purpose and objectives as outlined in Chapter 1 of this AFI. located is 8.3.2.  Appropriated  funds  may  be  used  for  enhanced  advertising  vehicles  offered  by  social media to advertise vacancies or performances as long as the advertisements do not engage in grassroots lobbying or take action(s) in violation of publicity or propaganda prohibitions (i.e. covert propaganda, self-aggrandizement or purely partisan communication). Bands planning to  boost  content,  as  opposed  to  advertisements  for  vacancies  and  upcoming  performances, must  first  obtain  approval  from  SAF/PAB  and  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  Office  of  Public Affairs, Command Information Division (SAF/PAI). (T-2) that  none  of 8.3.2.1.  Grass  Roots  Lobbying:  Air  Force  Bands  ensure their advertisements,  communications,  including  Facebook  posts  and  Twitter  tweets,  can  be perceived as making (either by  asking or encouraging)  a direct  or indirect  appeal  to  the public  to  contact  members  of  Congress  with  regards  to  any  pending  legislation.    Air Force Bands should not use advertisements or communications in a manner that could be perceived as appealing to the public to encourage increases in federal funding or to affect other  congressional  action  for  Air  Force  Band  activities.    Additionally,  when  using hyperlinks  to  external  websites in  its communications and advertising, Air Force  Bands should  be  vigilant  in  checking  the  information  on  the  linked  websites  for  potential violations  of  the  grassroots  lobbying  prohibition  as  the  Air  Force  Band  will  be responsible for the messages it endorses through such hyperlinks. AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 37 8.3.2.2.  Covert  Propaganda:  All  information  disseminated  by  Air  Force  Bands  must clearly  identify  the  Air  Force  Band  as  the  author  and/or  sponsor  of  the  messages  being disseminated. 8.3.2.3.  Self-Aggrandizement:  Air  Force  Bands  should  not  use  advertisements  to primarily emphasize their own importance.  For example, a social media post advertising an  upcoming  4th  of  July  concert  focuses  on  inspiring  patriotism,  as  opposed  to  solely showcasing the band. 8.3.2.4.  Partisan Communication: Air Force Bands should ensure advertisements are not political in nature. 8.3.2.5.  Anti-Deficiency Act:  Violations of the prohibition on grass roots lobbying and the publicity or propaganda prohibition also trigger potential Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA) violations.  The ADA prohibits an agency from making or authorizing an expenditure or obligation  that  exceeds  available  budget  authority.  Because  the  Air  Force  has  no appropriation available for grassroots lobbying or prohibited publicity or propaganda, any expenditure of funds for these purposes would constitute a potential ADA violation. 8.4.  Video  and  Audio  Project  Planning  Guidelines.  A  careful,  effects-based  approach  to reaching key audiences significantly increases the degree to which recordings and video projects augment a Band’s mission. Planning should involve the following: 8.4.1.  Communication  Planning  Process.  In  the  earliest  stages  of  the  recording  process, active  duty  Bands  should  coordinate  with  senior  leadership  and  their  local  Public  Affairs team  to  identify  the  key  audience  and  desired  effects  for  each  project.  ANG  Bands  may develop  this  plan  internally  and/or  with  their  local  or  state  Public  Affairs  team.  Once  the audience  and  effects  have  been  identified,  the  Band  should  utilize  the  Communication Planning Process (Research, Plan, Execute, and Assess) to develop the programming, design and distribution elements of the project. Refer to AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Responsibilities and Management, Chapter 6 for more information. 8.4.2.  Effects-based  musical  programming.  Bands  should  select,  arrange,  organize,  and perform music in such a way as to create a series of specific effects in support of combatant command, HAF, MAJCOM and local commander priorities. 8.4.3.  Effects-based  graphic  design.  The  artistic  pairing  of  music  and  graphic  design  is  a critical  element  of  the  recording  project.  Bands  should  ensure  music  and  graphic  art  are complementary in style and quality, and are designed to achieve desired effects. Regardless of its artistic style, each project should reflect the professionalism and corporate image of the Air Force. See paragraph 8.5 and subparagraphs for more information. 8.4.4.  Effects-based  product  distribution.  Bands  should  design  distribution  strategies  based on  demographic  studies  of  their  key  audience.  As  playback  technologies  and  the  listening habits of consumers become more diverse, so should the distribution methods. Bands should be  prepared  to  utilize  innovative,  cost-effective  and  practical  methods  of  distribution  that effectively reach audiences. 8.5.  Graphic Design. 8.5.1.  Graphic  design  for  all  recording  projects  will  be  approved  by  SAF/PAB  to  ensure proper display of Air Force corporate image. (T-2) 38 AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 8.5.1.1.  Graphic  designs  that  accompany  any  recorded  product  should  prominently feature  the  Air  Force  logo  on  the  front  cover  and  comply  with  trademark  and  licensing guidance website: http://www.trademark.af.mil/usagerules/index.asp. following the found at 8.5.1.2.  The ANG logo is also prominently displayed on the exterior of any graphic art associated  with  an  ANG  Band  recording.  See  the  following  authorized  logo: http://www.ang.af.mil/shared/media/ggallery/webgraphic/AFG-120410-003.jpg. 8.5.1.3.  The  graphic  design  should  creatively  represent  some  aspect  of  following attributes  associated  with  the  Air  Force  corporate  image:  Technologically  advanced guardians  of  new  security  domains;  capable  of  winning  against  complex  threats;  highly professional and empowered thinkers; skilled innovators; compassionately human. 8.5.2.  The following disclaimers should be included on the back case or sleeve of compact discs  (CDs)  and  digital  versatile  discs  (DVDs),  exceptions  and  variations  are  approved  by SAF/PAB: 8.5.2.1.  Air Force Motto: “Aim High” 8.5.2.2.  “This recording is approved for Department of the Air Force use and is not for sale.” 8.5.2.3.  “The  United  States  Air  Force  is  wholeheartedly  committed  to  reflecting  the diversity  of  our  great  nation.  Individuals  from  all  cultural  and  ethnic  backgrounds  are actively  encouraged  to  learn  about  and  seek  positions  in  the  Air  Force.  For  more information,  contact  Air  Force  Recruiting  via  http://www.airforce.com/  or  call  1-800-423-USAF”. 8.5.2.4.  “For  more  information  on  United  States  Air  Force  Bands,  contact  (insert  local Band information here). 8.5.2.5.

If  material  protected  by  copyright  is  included  in  products  released  by  the  Air  Force, Air  Force  personnel  responsible  for  the  release  must  ensure  Air  Force  has  obtained  an appropriate license for  all materials  subject  to  copyright  protection and should consult  with qualified legal counsel to determine the necessary license provisions. (T-0) Refer to AFI 51-303, Intellectual Property—Patents, Patent Related Matters, Trademarks and Copyrights for more information. 8.6.2.  Bands  are  highly  encouraged  to  consider  developing  and  recording  content unrestricted by copyright or licensing agreements to remove barriers for use and distribution. 8.6.3.  Active  duty  regional  Bands  and  ANG  Bands  are  required  to  contact  the  Air  Force Public  Affairs  Agency  (AFPAA)  Copyright  and  Licensing  Support  Section  and  use AFPAA’s copyright research capabilities. (T-2) 8.7.  Distribution. AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 39 8.7.1.  Bands  should  make  every  effort  to  maximize  legal  public  access  to  their  recordings. AFPAA  provides  digital  versions  of  recordings  of  original  compositions  by  Air  Force personnel  for  streaming  and  download  at  www.music.af.mil  Further  terms  and  conditions applicable to uploading and distribution of music are located in the 'Questions' section of the website,  and  any  additional  questions  about  appropriate  reproduction,  distribution,  and licensing of music via the website should be addressed in writing to the 'Contact Us' section of the website. 8.7.2.  Distribution plans also include the following: 8.7.2.1.  Air  Force  Museum.  Bands  send  three  copies  of  recordings  to  the  National Museum of the United States Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433, for historical preservation. 8.7.2.2.  Chief, Air Force Bands Division.  Bands send one copy to  the Chief, Air Force Bands Division,  Air  Force Public Affairs, 1690  Air Force Pentagon, Washington,  D.C., 20330-1690. 8.7.2.3.  Air  Force  Public  Affairs  Agency.  Bands  send  one  copy  to  AFPAA  Band Support, 555 E. Street East, Rm 102, JBSA-Randolph, TX 78150. 8.8.  The  Air  Force  Public  Affairs  Agency  (AFPAA).  AFPAA  fills  the  following  roles  with regard to recording: 8.8.1.  Provides copyright and licensing research and support. 8.8.2.  Facilitates  the  distribution  of  recordings  through  various  forms  of  digital  and  social media.  See paragraph 8.3 of this AFI on the use of social media. 8.8.3.  Makes copyright-free music recorded by Air Force Bands available to Public Affairs professionals around the world (http://www.music.af.mil/). Bands are encouraged to write, record, and submit all kinds of music for posting to this site. 8.8.4.  AFPAA  can  provide  assistance  with  identifying  a  servicing  professional  video production  center  either  owned  by  the  Band’s  MAJCOM  or  by  AFPAA,  to  provide  video production support. 8.9.  General  Guidance  Recording  Benefits  and  Justification.  Air  Force  Bands  are  highly encouraged  to  record.  Recording  plays  an  important  and  multifaceted  role  in  Band  operations and in promoting the proficiency and readiness of Airman musicians. Quality recorded products serve as a clear demonstration of Air Force excellence and professionalism and are used to help support Airmen, render honor to the nation and its heroes, connect with public audiences at home and overseas, and support Air Force recruiting efforts. Recording augments Band operations in three critical ways: 8.9.1.  Recordings are powerful communication tools. Air Force Bands produce, utilize, and distribute  audio  and  video  recordings  as  communication  tools  to  strategically  affect audiences around the globe. Recordings are used to accomplish the following: 8.9.1.1.  Efficiently communicate key Air Force messages. Through the creative synergy of  words,  images,  and/or  sounds,  recordings  communicate  key  Air  Force  messages  in highly memorable formats. 40 AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 8.9.1.2.  Foster  morale  and  enhance  public  trust.  Band  recordings  harness  the  effects  of music to  foster and enhance the morale and esprit  de corps of Air Force  personnel,  and strengthen public trust and support from the nation they serve. 8.9.1.3.  Communicate  excellence.  Quality  recordings  clearly  communicate  Air  Force excellence  to  radio,  television,  and  internet  audiences.  This  excellence  inspires  and educates  audiences  of  all  ages  and  attracts  potential  recruits,  sponsors,  and  event coordinators. 8.9.1.4.  Bridge  cultural  barriers.  Recordings  use  music  to  bridge  language,  cultural, societal,  and  socio-economic  barriers,  and  can  be  an  effective  part  of  relationship building. 8.9.2.  Recordings  serve  as  force  multipliers.  Air  Force  Band  recordings  serve  as  force multipliers in the following ways: 8.9.2.1.  Expand  a  Band’s  reach.  Recordings  can  be  employed  to  significantly  expand  a Band’s reach. Due to their small size and the abundant methods of playback, recordings are  a  cost-effective  way  to  multiply  a  Band’s  ability  to  reach  audiences  and  thereby increase its effectiveness. 8.9.2.2.  Re-usable  outreach  tools.  While  recordings  don’t  provide  as  dynamic  an experience as live concerts, recordings are a permanent representation of the Air Force’s corporate  image.  Due  to  their  ease  of  use  (and  re-use),  recordings  have  the  potential  to not only reach a wider variety of audiences, but reach them numerous times. 8.9.2.3.  Helpful  recruiting  tools.  As  industry-standard  demonstrations  of  musical excellence in a commercially accepted format, Band recordings not only provide musical support to the Air Force’s broader recruiting efforts, but help attract and encourage highly skilled musicians to consider a career in the Air Force. 8.9.3.  The  recording  process  provides  highly  effective  musical  training  for  Air  Force musicians.  The  nature  of  the  recording  process  makes  it  an  unparalleled  and  uniquely effective way for musicians to maintain and improve their skills while remaining engaged in ongoing  operations.  Whether  performing,  leading,  or  producing,  the  recording  process challenges,  tests,  and  improves  a  wide  variety  of  skills  necessary  to  maintain  musical proficiency and readiness. Recording enhances musical training in the following ways: 8.9.3.1.  Functions like a critical military exercise focused on operational readiness. The recording  process  vigorously  tests  the  skills  Bands  use  every  day  in  standard  musical operations,  and  provides  intense,  direct  feedback  which  highlights  areas  of  excellence and  areas  requiring  improvement.  Skill  levels  are  then  documented  in  an  industry standard recording format. 8.9.3.2.  Shortens the music performance feedback cycle. The recording process focuses intensely  on  the  synergy  of  technical  skill  and  creative  artistry  of  professional  Airman musicians.  With  immediately  repeated  cycles  of  practice,  performance,  and  assessment, recording  enables  Bands  to  maintain  and  push  the  boundary  of  their  peak  performance levels. While other Band operations generally contain this same cycle, the immediacy of the repetition, the absence of a live audience (other than peers), and the goal of producing AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 41 a  permanent  product  for  distribution  make  the  recording  process  an  effective  training environment. irreplaceable  real-world 8.9.3.3.  Provides  an that  benefits individual  Airman  musicians,  music  performing  teams,  and  Band  leadership.  The rigorous  discipline  involved  in  the  recording  process  focuses  on  musical  skill  and proficiency more intensely than any other Band activity. training  environment 42 AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 CHAPTER 9 FUNDING AND LOGISTICS 9.1.  Funding  . 9.1.1.  The  highest  level  of  command  (MAJCOM,  DRU,  or  wing)  under  which  a  Band  is assigned provides operational funding for the Band. 9.1.2.  Bands  fund  their  own  travel  expenses  for  performances  throughout  their  AOR. Therefore,  a  sizable  portion  of  each  Band’s  operating  budget  includes  funding  for  TDY support of ceremonial, military, civic outreach, and recruiting events. 9.2.  Equipment & Supplies. 9.2.1.  Bands procure equipment, supplies, and music per the applicable procedures described in,  AFI  23-101,  Air  Force  Materiel  Management,  and  IAW  the  Air  Force  Equipment Management  System  at  https://www.afems.wpafb.af.mil/.

Before disposing of equipment, supplies, or music, Bands should contact other active duty  or  ANG  Bands  and  offer  the  opportunity  to  transfer  materials.  Return  excess  musical equipment  purchased  with  appropriated  funds  to  the  equipment  management  office  of  the base  supply  facility  for  redistribution  in  accordance  with  AFMAN  23-122,  Material Management Procedures. 9.2.5.  In  Store  Credit.    Band  property  may  be  exchanged  when  a  similar  item  will  be acquired.  AF/JAA  and  SAF/GCQ  have  determined  the  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Subpart 13.201(c) allows for this type of program. Important guidelines: 9.2.5.1.  Trade  transactions  do  not  involve  transactions  that  exceed  the  micro-purchase limit of the Government Purchase Card. 9.2.5.2.  Revolving credit with a vendor is not authorized. 9.2.5.3.  Meticulous record keeping of each transaction is employed. 9.2.5.4.  Purchases will not be split into separate orders to stay under the micro-purchase limit. 9.2.5.5.  Exchanging  items  that  exceed  the  micro-purchase  limit  will  be  handled  by  the local contracting activity. 9.2.5.6.  In-store credit account balances are not authorized. 9.3.  Performance  Uniforms.  Formal  concert,  ceremonial,  and informal  uniforms  are authorized in Allowance Standard-016 (AS-016) and listed in AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance  of  Air  Force  Personnel.  These  items  should  be  used  for  all  concerts,  parades, AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 43 ceremonies,  and  official  functions.  Formal  concert,  ceremonial,  and  informal  uniforms  are authorized  for  wear  only  for  rehearsals,  during  transport,  sound  checks,  and  performances. Organizational clothing, performance clothing, and accessories are ordered, stored, cleaned, and maintained  by  the  respective  Bands  with  accountability  resting  with  the  respective  individual Band.  Contracted  civilian  musician’s  apparel  will  be  approved  by  the  local  senior  band  officer responsible for the event. 9.3.1.  Musicians performing for a military event, even if unofficial and social in nature such as  a  military  ball,  must  wear  the  appropriate  uniform  or  civilian  attire  as  requested  by  the host/hostess  or  directed  by  the  commander.    If  civilian  attire  is  required,  the  Air  Force Informal  Uniform  is  an  appropriate  uniform  to  wear  in  these  situations,  per  AFI  36-2903 paragraph 9.2., unless the host/hostess or commander requires different civilian attire based on  cultural,  diplomatic,  or  security  needs.  Civilian  performance  clothing  is  ordered,  stored, cleaned,  and  maintained  as  organizational  clothing  by  the  respective  Bands  with accountability resting with the respective individual Band. 9.3.2.  Commanders  may  authorize  female  Airman  musicians  performing  in  mess  dress  to wear  altered  mess  dress  pants  in  lieu  of  the  skirt,  when  a  skirt  would  inhibit  the  ability  to properly play the instrument and maintain a proper professional military image. 9.3.3.  In  appropriate  circumstances,  commanders  may  authorize  performance  clothing  that reflects Air Force culture, has a direct thematic correlation to the music, and does not bring discredit upon the Air Force. 9.3.4.  When  Band  members  PCS  to  another  Band,  certain  performance  uniforms  or accessories, as agreed upon by the gaining and losing Band commanders or managers, may be transferred to the gaining Band. 9.3.5.  The ceremonial uniform is worn as authorized in AFI 36-2903 and AFMAN 35-106, Ceremonial Music. 9.3.6.  The  Supplemental  Clothing  Allowance  is  described  in  AFI  36-3014,  Clothing Allowances for Air Force Personnel. Rates and frequency for this allowance can be found in DoD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Vol 7A, Ch. 29, Table 29-6. 9.4.  Facilities.  AFMAN  32-1084,  Facility  Requirements,  paragraph  2.7.2.,  outlines requirements for Band facilities. Rehearsal rooms and other space include: 9.4.1.  Acoustically  treated  rehearsal  studios  and  individual  practice  rooms.  All  required Band units must be able to train simultaneously in separate rehearsal studios. (T-2) Rehearsal rooms  are  soundproofed  sufficiently  so  ensembles  experience  no  degradation  in  rehearsal efficiency.  Ceilings  are  at  least  20  feet  high  in  large  rehearsal  rooms,  and  15  feet  high  in smaller rehearsal rooms. A professional acoustician should be employed during phases of a facility design or redesign. 9.4.2.  Secured areas for the music library, music arranging equipment, musical instruments, and supplies. 9.4.3.  Individual lockers and separate dressing rooms and restrooms for men and women. 9.4.4.  Administrative spaces with separate offices for the commander, flight commander(s), manager, superintendent(s), first sergeant, operations section, and administrative support. 44 AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 9.4.5.  The space requirements for Band facilities are published in  AFMAN 32-1084, Table 2.31. 9.5.  Vehicles.  Bands  are  the  primary  users  of  vehicles  assigned  to  their  units.  Minimum requirements  are  determined  by  the  441st  Vehicle  Support  Chain  Operations  Squadron  during vehicle  validation  visits  and  in  accordance  with  AFI  24-302,  Vehicle  Management.  Based  on historical and ongoing mission parameters, recognized requirements are as follows: 9.5.1.  The  USAF  Band:  five  intercity  coaches,  three  five-ton  trucks  with  lifts,  two  15-passenger van/truck carry-alls, and one 8-passenger van/truck carry-all. 9.5.2.  The  USAF  Band  of  the  Pacific-Hawaii:  one  five-ton  truck  with  lift,  and  two  15-passenger van/truck carry-alls. 9.5.3.  The USAF Band of the Pacific-Asia: one intercity coach, one five-ton truck with lift, two 2.5-ton trucks with lift, and two 15-passenger van/truck carry-alls. 9.5.4.  Fifteen-member  unit:  two  trucks  (any  combination  of:  2.5-ton  truck  with  lift,  5-ton truck with lift, 6-passenger truck with topper, as determined by local requirements) and two 15-passenger van/truck carry-alls. 9.5.5.  The USAFE Band:  two intercity coaches, three trucks (any combination of 2.5 and 5-ton  trucks  each  with  a  lift,  as  determined  by  local  requirements),  and  two  15-passenger van/truck carry-alls. 9.5.6.  Sixty-member  unit:  two  intercity  coaches,  three  trucks  (any  combination  of  2.5-  and five-ton  trucks each with lift, as determined by local  requirements), and three 15-passenger van/truck carry-alls. 9.5.7.  ANG Bands: one intercity coach, two 2.5 ton trucks with lifts, and two 15-passenger van/truck carry-alls. 9.5.8.  Truck lift requirements: folding platform  rail lift rated at  3,000 lb. max load weight, 66”-72” deep platform, 90” with 12” fixed ramp with 4” cart stop (to lift/lower road cases up to 45” wide x 42” deep safely). The five-ton and 2.5-ton trucks should have lifts which can be used in conjunction with a loading dock. 9.5.9.  In accordance with AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, intercity coaches are assigned to the  vehicle  operations  branch  of  the  Logistics  Readiness  Squadron  with  the  Band  as  the primary  user.  All  Band  travel  requirements  are  met  before  the  coaches  are  used  to  support other authorized activities. When no Band requirements exist, coaches may be used for other authorized on- or off-base transportation needs. 9.5.10.  When an intercity coach is not available for Band use, it is the responsibility of the installation Vehicle Management activity to short-term lease or charter a replacement vehicle to meet the Band’s scheduled engagements. Funding for leased or chartered buses is provided by  the  Band.  Since  charter  contracts  usually  require  a  minimum  of  24-hours  prior  notice, Band  coaches  cannot  be  used  for  non-Band  travel  24  hours  before  a  scheduled  Band  trip. This  ensures  sufficient  time  to  make  repairs  or  obtain  a  commercial  contract  for  a replacement coach if the Band coach should develop mechanical problems. 9.5.11.  The Band pays drivers’ TDY expenses for all Band-related travel. AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 45 9.5.12.  Changes  to  vehicle  authorizations  or  new  requirements  are  submitted  to  the installation  Vehicle  Fleet  Manager  for  review  and  subsequent  submittal  to  441st  Vehicle Support Chain Operations for approval. Refer to AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management, for more information concerning vehicle authorizations and short-term lease request process. 9.6.  Contracts  with  Civilian  Musicians.  Air  Force  Bands  are  authorized  to  contract  civilian musicians for community outreach performances and recording sessions. The amount paid to the civilian  musician  should  reflect  the  fair  market  value  of  the  musician’s  services  in  order  to prevent ethics and gift issues. 46 AFI35-110  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 10 ADVERTISING, ACCESSIONS, TRAINING, AND UTILIZATION 10.1.
