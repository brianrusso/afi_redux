PURPOSE.  This instruction: a.  Reissues Directive-type Memorandum 13-004 (Reference (a)) as a DoD instruction (DoDI) in accordance with the authority in DoD Directive (DoDD) 5118.03 (Reference (b)) and section 1599d of Title 10, United States Code (Reference (c)) to establish policy, assign responsibilities, and prescribe procedures for implementation of the DoD Financial Management (FM) Certification Program (referred to in this instruction as the “Certification Program”). b.  Establishes the Certification Program Management Structure. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  This instruction applies to the OSD, the Military Departments, the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, the Defense Agencies, the DoD Field Activities, and all other organizational entities within the DoD (referred to collectively in this instruction as the “DoD Components”). 3.  POLICY.  It is DoD policy that: a.  The Certification Program supports the professional development of the FM workforce and provides a framework for a standard body of knowledge across the FM workforce. b.  Members of the FM workforce are required to participate in the Certification Program; therefore, achieving certification is a condition of employment in that members of the FM workforce must be able to obtain the appropriate certification level for their positions within 2 years after assignment.1             DoDI 1300.26_AFI65-117  23 February 2016   (1)  The FM workforce includes DoD military and civilian personnel who perform FM work and are assigned to FM positions.  FM positions include military and civilian positions that perform, supervise, or manage work of a fiscal, financial management, accounting, auditing, cost or budgetary nature, or that require the performance of financial management-related work. (2)  FM positions are those civilian positions with a 05XX series, military positions with FM occupational specialties, and non-05XX/military positions performing financial management work when designated by DoD Components and if Acquisition coded in areas other than Business-Financial Management, Business-Cost Estimating and Acquisition Audit, as approved by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)). c.  Individuals assigned to positions with an FM Certification designation must comply with FM Certification requirements within 2 years from notification.  If an individual transfers to a new position during the initial 2 years that requires the same FM certification level, he or she is required to complete certification within the original 2 year period.  However, personnel with Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) Certifications outlined in DoDI 5000.66 (Reference (d)) required to complete FM certification will be given consideration for time waivers if required. d.  The Certification Program requirements will be uniformly applied to all designated FM positions.  FM positions will be designated by DoD Components with a specific certification level based on the complexity and level of responsibility of the position.  In those cases where positions are designated as both FM and DAWIA (Business Financial Management, Business Cost Estimating, or Auditing) personnel will be required to complete both certification programs. Approval of FM Certification will be granted provided the applicable requirements in this instruction are completed. e.  The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer, Department of Defense (USD(C)/CFO) is authorized to waive any requirement prescribed in the Certification Program. 4.  RESPONSIBILITIES.  See Enclosure 2. 5.   RELEASABILITY.  Unlimited.

Identifying FM Positions (1)  FM positions are identified as civilian or military positions that perform, supervise, or manage the work of a fiscal, FM, accounting, auditing, cost, or budgetary nature, or that require the performance of FM-related work.    (a) (Added) (AF)  FM positions are defined as those coded with an Air Force  Specialty Code (AFSC) of 65FX, 65WX or 6F0XX, occupational series 05XX, or outside of the 05XX occupational series performing more than 50% FM duties (e.g., Resource Advisors, FM training instructors, program analysts, operations research analyst, etc.).  Additionally, CCAs have the final authority to determine those positions performing FM duties under this definition, regardless of percentage of time to be spent performing FM duties.     (b) (Added) (AF)  FM personnel serving in non-FM positions, either by    15 ENCLOSURE 3           DoDI 1300.26_AFI65-117  23 February 2016  designation (e.g., ROTC, military training instructors, etc.) or as part of a career-broadening program, are not subject to certification requirements while serving in these capacities.  Upon re-entry into an FM position, FM personnel will have two years to achieve their prescribed certification level or required CETs. (T-0) (c) (Added) (AF)  Non-FM personnel serving in FM career-broadening      positions (e.g., Financial Management Leadership Program [FMLPs]) will be required     to pursue FM Certification while in their career-broadening position. (T-0)     (2)  FM positions to which this certification applies:   (a)  Civilian positions coded with the 05XX Occupational Series listed in Table  1 of this enclosure.   (b) Civilian positions not coded with the 05XX Occupational Series that  perform, supervise, or manage the work of a fiscal, FM, accounting, auditing, cost, or budgetary nature when designated by DoD Components.  USD(AT&L) approval is required for inclusion of acquisition-coded positions in areas other than Business-FM, Business-Cost Estimating, and Acquisition-Auditing. Table 1.

(d) Military positions not coded with the FM/Comptroller/Resource Management  Occupational Series that perform, supervise, or manage FM work of a fiscal, financial management, accounting, auditing, cost, or budgetary nature when designated by DoD Components. AT&L approval is required for inclusion of Acquisition coded positions in areas other than Business-Financial Management, Business-Cost Estimating and Acquisition Audit.  b.  Designating and Coding FM Positions with Certification Levels   (1)  DoD Components determine and designate the required certification level for each FM position within the Component.  DoD Components with civilian and military personnel assigned to joint organizations or positions will coordinate with the Joint Staff, the Military Departments, the Combatant Command Support Agency (if applicable) and USD(AT&L) (for Acquisition coded positions outside of Business-Financial Management and Business-Cost Estimating) in the designation of the positions and updating PDSs and joint manning documents in accordance with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 1001.01A (Reference (n)).  (2)  The three Certification Program certification levels are defined in the Glossary.     (3)  DoD Components determine the certification level of their FM positions considering the complexity and level of responsibility of the position.  The Figure provides general guidance for designating the certification level of positions for General Schedule (or equivalent) and Senior Executive Service civilians (or equivalent), commissioned officers, warrant officers, and enlisted.  The Components have discretion in applying the guidance to their respective organizations for all pay plans to include other broadband or pay-band equivalents. (4)  The  discretion  allowed  the  DoD  Components  is  intended  to  provide  flexibility rather  than  a  prescriptive  crosswalk  of  grade  or  rank  to  certification  level.    For  example,  a position of a lower grade or rank, such as a supervisor at a field activity or operational unit, may have a higher certification level than a position of the same or higher grade or rank in an organization at a higher echelon.  (a) (Added) (AF) AF FM Squadron/ANG FM Flight Commanders (on “G”  series orders) are designated as critical FM positions.  Component Lead CAs will code them at FM Certification Level 3. (T-1)    GS-13 comptrollers are designated as critical FM positions. ARC Lead CA will code these positions at FM Certification Level 3. (T-1)  (b) (Added) (AF) AF Reserve Component (ARC) FM Civilians who are  (c) (Added) (AF) ARC and ANG members who have FM certification   17 ENCLOSURE 3 DoDI 1300.26_AFI65-117  23 February 2016  requirements for both their military and civilian positions are considered “Dual Persona.”  Dual persona members will be coded at the highest level of Certification and will submit their package under the civilian profile in LMS.  See Appendix 3 to Enclosure 3.  (d) (Added) (AF) AF FM positions that are "growth positions" are coded at the target grade.   Figure.

(6)  DoD Components should designate Certification Program positions with a FM Certification Level of 1, 2, or 3 in the Component’s organizational manpower systems. 3.  INCLUSION OF FM MEMBERS INTO THE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM  18 ENCLOSURE 3 DoDI 1300.26_AFI65-117  23 February 2016          a.  Full-time civilians and active duty military FM members: (1)  When FM members are placed in an FM certification position, the DoD Component will either document that the individual has satisfied appropriate certification training requirements or establish a plan for the individual to meet the requirements within 2 years of assignment. (a)  The DoD Components will inform the FM members, in writing, of the date their positions are designated with a Certification Program certification level and document the notification within 30 days of the intended start date.  The date listed on the notification document is considered the actual start date. (b)  If, during the initial 2 years, the FM member transfers to a new position that requires the same certification level of the previous position, then the FM member is notified of the requirement to complete certification within the original 2 year period. (c)  If the FM member transfers to a position for which he or she has already achieved the required Certification Level, the member will be notified of the requirement to maintain certification by completing CETs. (2) If the DoD Component has included the FM Certification requirement in the civilian   PD or in the requirements for a military FM position, the date the FM member is assigned can be  considered the start date.  (3) Additional information and templates to assist the DoD Components with official    written notification of employees can be found on the FM Online Website.  b.  Other members of the DoD FM workforce assigned to positions designated with an FM Certification level are addressed in Appendix 3 to this enclosure.  For the purpose of this policy this population includes: (1)  Reserve and National Guard (NG) Military Service members. (2)  Part-time and temporary civilian employees. 4.  ACHIEVING, DOCUMENTING, AND SUSTAINING FM CERTIFICATION a.  Achievement of FM Certification (1) The FM member must be able to obtain the FM Certification requirement of the position he or she is assigned.  In the event an individual cannot obtain the FM Certification in the initial 2-year time period, the CCA may grant a time waiver (s) in 1-year increments to remain in the position.  If an individual fails to obtain the required FM Certification and the CCA approved time waiver(s) have expired, the individual is subject to adverse actions.    19 ENCLOSURE 3 DoDI 1300.26_AFI65-117  23 February 2016  (2)  Once an FM member achieves certification at the level required for the position assigned, the member is awarded the following designation. (a)  Certification Level 1:  DFMCP1 (DoD FM Certification Program Level 1) (b)  Certification Level 2:  DFMCP2 (DoD FM Certification Program Level 2) (c)  Certification Level 3:  DFMCP3 (DoD FM Certification Program Level 3) b.  Documenting FM Certification (1)  Once an FM member is included in the Certification Program, the member uses the FM LMS to document training for FM Certification. (a)  The member assembles documentation of FM and leadership courses and uses the FM LMS to document achievement of certification requirements, as outlined in Appendix 1 to this enclosure.  Workshops, seminars, or symposiums that are not structured learning events with at least one course objective, and agenda, or an outline (e.g., a professional society event) cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of initial certification; however, they do qualify for CETs.  1.  Documentation used to verify completion of courses is provided by an independent party that substantiates completion of a course or program. 2.  Examples of acceptable documentation include, but are not limited to, academic transcripts, certificates of completion, and DD Form 214, “Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty.”          (b)  The member provides documentation or verification, as required in the FM LMS. When the member determines all certification requirements for his or her specific certification level are completed, the member submits a request for approval of certification to the supervisor. (c)  The member may request a waiver in accordance with the waiver policy outlined in section 6 of this enclosure when submitting a request for certification.         (d) (Added) AF  All AF FM members will, prior to FM LMS input, ensure that any  documentation  included  as  verification  of  course  completion  has  all  Personally Identifiable  Information  (PII)  properly  redacted.    (T-0)    The  Chief  Information  Officer (CIO) has determined that the following is considered PII.                                                           •Social Security number - full and truncated  •Other identification numbers (includes EIN/CAC/student numbers)  •Citizenship, legal status, gender, and race/ethnicity  •Birth date, place of birth  •Home and personal cell telephone numbers  ENCLOSURE 3 20       DoDI 1300.26_AFI65-117  23 February 2016                                                                    •Personal email address, mailing, and home addresses  •Religious preference  •Security clearance  •Spouse, marital status, child, & emergency contact information •Financial information  •Disability information (2)  The supervisor (or individuals designated as supervisors in the FM LMS) reviews each request for approval of certification and either: (a)  Recommends approval and forwards the request; or (b)  Disapproves the request and notifies the member of the reason for disapproval. (3)  The A2, if applicable, reviews each request for certification already recommended for approval by the supervisor and either: (a)  Recommends approval and forwards the request to the CCA; or (b)  Disapproves the request and notifies the supervisor of the reason for disapproval. (4)  The CCA reviews each request for certification. (a)  When a CCA approves certification, including requested waivers, the CCA posts and maintains the FM workforce member’s certification achievement in the FM LMS. (b)  When a CCA disapproves certification, the CCA notifies the supervisor and member of the disapproval, and the reason for the disapproval. (5)  After a CCA approves certification, the DoD Component can print the Certification Program certificate signed by the USD(C)/CFO using the FM LMS. c.  Sustainment of FM Certification (1)  After achievement of certification, FM workforce members are required to maintain their FM Certification and improve their FM proficiency and skills by taking available FM or leadership professional education and training.  To sustain an achieved certification level, a member must earn a specific quantity of CET hours every 2 years. (2)  The CET requirements for each FM certification level are: (a)  40 hours every 2 years for Certification Level 1. (b)  60 hours every 2 years for Certification Level 2.          21 ENCLOSURE 3 DoDI 1300.26_AFI65-117  23 February 2016  (c)  80 hours every 2 years for Certification Level 3.          (3)  The 2-year time period for CET requirements begins on date of the FM workforce member’s FM Certification approval and extends to the same day of the 24th following month. (a)  Each successive 2-year period is defined accordingly, and the CET requirement applies to each 2-year period. (b)  The time periods for FM Certification CETs may not be adjusted to coincide with time periods for continuing education requirements of any of the other 20 test-based FM certification programs, such as Certified Public Accountant. (4)  CET hours may be credited in any of the following manners, as long as the education or training is completed within the applicable 2-year time period: (a)  The intent of this policy is that continuing education or training for the Certification Program will not be an additive requirement to other DoD FM recognized certification programs (Certified Defense Financial Manager, Certified Public Accountant, etc.). 1.  Education or training completed to sustain certification in any of the DoD- recognized FM test-based certification programs can be credited to CET requirements for FM Certification on a unit-to-unit basis. 2.  If a test-based certification program uses a continuing professional education (CPE) or similar units based on a 50-minute instructional hour (such as the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy), then that CPE or similar unit is equivalent to the CET hour described in this instruction, even though the CPE or similar unit is 50 minutes.   Certification Program can be credited for CET on a unit-to-unit basis.        (b) Continuing learning points earned under the DoD acquisition workforce (c)  Course hours earned from any FM training course included in the Course Catalog on the FM myLearn Website at https://fmonline.ousdc.osd.mil/FMmyLearn/Default.aspx. (d)  Continuing education units (CEU), as defined by the International Association for Continuing Education and Training Website (Reference (o)), can be credited to an FM workforce member based on the equation:  one CEU equals ten CET.  (5)  FM workforce members are responsible for recording achievement of CET in their respective FM LMS accounts and for maintaining documentation of CET achievements.  They are encouraged to retain CET documentation permanently, but required to retain documentation for 4 years.  FM members are subject to CET audits where they may be required to provide documentation of CET earned.     (a) (Added) (AF) Each employee/member should maintain a hard and/or soft ENCLOSURE 3 22 DoDI 1300.26_AFI65-117  23 February 2016  copy of their CET documentation.  This documentation should be in the form of a training certificate, letter of training or other documentation that reflects the FM subject matter of training, date of training, and duration of training.  Documentation must be produced upon request during a CET audit.      5.  FM CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS a.  FM Certification Requirements Overview (1)  The Certification Program is a course-based program consisting of three certification levels, as outlined in Table 2. (2)  Certification requirements are based on: (a)  FM competencies and associated proficiency levels (PLs) (as defined in USD(C)/CFO Memorandum (Reference (p))) with specific course hour requirements.  FM course content aligned with FM competency and PL combinations satisfies requirements in terms of course hours.  1.

(b)  Leadership competencies within the Lead Self, Lead Teams/Projects, and Lead People, levels (as defined in the DoD Civilian Leader Development Framework and Continuum (CLDF&C) outlined in DoDI 1430.16 (Reference (q))) with specific course hour requirements. Leadership course content aligned to leadership competencies within one of the aforementioned levels satisfies FM Certification requirements.  (c)  Other required courses, such as FM 101 course modules for Certification Level 1 as well as courses in audit readiness, fiscal law, and ethics for Certification Levels 2 and 3. (d)  Work experience performing FM-related work.      (1) (Added) (AF)  FM personnel are responsible for maintaining a record of  their total FM experience, (DoD and non-DoD FM experience) with supporting documentation for the duration of their career.  Items that can be used to verify FM experience include:  Single Uniform Retrieval Formats (SURFs), supervisor-signed memorandums for record (MFRs), resumes, career briefs, etc.      (2) (Added) (AF)  If using an MFR, use the format on FM Online.  A qualified/responsible person with direct knowledge of the member’s experience during the time period listed must complete the MFR.  (T-0)  The experience being recorded needs to show a level of knowledge and needs to have been performed at a level of skill and responsibility expected for the member’s Certification Level.               (e)  Developmental assignment(s) in terms of months (for Certification Level 3 only).        25 ENCLOSURE 3 DoDI 1300.26_AFI65-117  23 February 2016         (3)  The certification levels of the Certification Program are related to the PLs of the DoD FM enterprise-wide competencies as follows:       (1)  Certification Level 1 equates to FM Proficiency Level 1.      (2)  Certification Level 2 equates to FM Proficiency Level 3 (with the exception of “Fundamentals and Operations” of the alternate track, which is at Proficiency Level 1 or higher).      (3)  Certification Level 3 equates to FM Proficiency Level 5 (with the exception of “Concepts, Policies, and Principles” of the alternate track, which is at Proficiency Level 3 or higher).     (4)  Certification level requirements are not cumulative.  Specifically, an FM workforce  member assigned to a Certification Level 2-coded position is not required to complete Certification Level 1 requirements prior to starting Level 2 Certification; a member assigned to a Certification Level 3-coded position is not required to complete Certification Level 2 prior to starting Certification Level 3.   (5)  FM  members  certified  at  a  particular  certification  level  remain  certified  at  that level regardless of any new Certification Program requirements for that level made effective at a later date.  (6)  FM workforce members previously achieving a higher level certification than required by their current position are not required to complete the certification requirements for the lower levels. b.  FM Certification Level 1 Requirements (1)  The FM member must complete the required course hours for each specified FM competency, at the PL prescribed in Tables 3 and 4.  The available FM courses and other courses aligned to FM competency and PLs can be found on FM myLearn Website.  (2)  An FM member need select only one “Fundamentals and Operations” FM competency; the subject of this competency establishes the member’s primary track.  The choices for the primary track are accounting, budget, finance, or military and civilian pay.  The primary track selected normally corresponds to the occupational series or specialty of the position to which the member is assigned.         (a) (Added) (AF)  For enlisted personnel in the grades of E1 through E5, the primary track for Level 1 certification is the “Fundamentals and Operations of Finance.”  The other subject areas (Budget, Accounting, Military or Civilian Pay) are not authorized.  Personnel who complete their FM Certification prior to the publication of this AF Instruction are not subject to this requirement and can retain the certification already achieved.     26 ENCLOSURE 3 DoDI 1300.26_AFI65-117  23 February 2016   Table 3.

(4)  The FM member is required to complete at least 8 years of FM work experience for Certification Level 3, a minimum of 2 years of which must be DoD FM work experience. (5)  The FM member is required to complete a 3-month developmental assignment that is different from the principal duties performed in previous assignments.  A developmental assignment is generally considered work that is outside of the member's current primary track. Previous work in another track will fulfill this requirement.  Additionally, work within the same track may also fulfill the developmental assignment requirement if it was accomplished at a  different organizational level (e.g., budgetary work accomplished at the base or unit level and budgetary work at a major command or headquarters level).  DoD Components have the discretion to determine what qualifies as a developmental assignment.  (a) (Added) (AF)  Enlisted personnel in the grades of E8 and E9 must  complete the required course hours for each specified competency at the proficiency level   30 ENCLOSURE 3 DoDI 1300.26_AFI65-117  23 February 2016  prescribed in Table 6 of DoDI 1300.26 for Level 3 certification.  (T-0)  Additionally, the alternate track is “Concepts, Policies and Principles of Accounting.”  No other subjects are authorized for satisfying alternate track requirements.  Personnel who complete their FM Certification prior to the publication of this AF Instruction are not subject to this requirement and can retain the certification already achieved.  (6)  An  FM  member  assigned  to  a  Level  3  position  is  strongly  encouraged  to work  towards  a  master’s  degree  and  complete  one  of  the  DoD-approved  test-based certification programs. 6.  WAIVERS, SUBSTITUTIONS, AND EXCEPTIONS TO POLICY a.  Waiver Policy.  There are two types of waivers:  time waivers for certification and DoD FM 101 module waivers. (1)  Time Waiver (a)  FM members may request a time waiver, with supporting rationale, if they are unable to complete their certification requirements within the 2-year time period.  (b)  All requests for time waivers must be elevated to the CCA level for decision.  (c)  The CCA is authorized to approve or disapprove time waivers for certification completion in 1-year increments. (d)  The time waivers with supporting rationale are subject to audits. (2)  DoD FM 101 Module Waivers (a)  CCAs are authorized to waive the requirement of completing all twelve modules to a requirement of completing a minimum of six of twelve modules in accordance with their DoD Component’s implementation guidance for non-acquisition-coded positions.  For acquisition positions, see Enclosure 4.  Any of the DoD FM 101 modules (up to the maximum of six) may be waived, with the exception of the Audit Readiness Module.  (1) (Added) (AF)  There are no waivers allowed for any Officer, Enlisted,  or Civilian FM personnel.  (b)  FM members will use the FM LMS to request waivers for the DoD FM 101 modules.  Instructions for requesting a DoD FM 101 module waiver within the FM LMS are available on the FM Online website. b.  Substitution Policy (1)  The following course requirements are subject to the “Substitution Process”:  31 ENCLOSURE 3          DoDI 1300.26_AFI65-117  23 February 2016  (a)  Certification Level 1:  DoD FM 101 course modules.  (b)  Certification Level 2:  audit readiness, fiscal law, and ethics courses. (c)  Certification Level 3:  audit readiness, fiscal law, and ethics courses. (2)  There  are  web-based  courses  for  DoD  FM  101,  audit  readiness,  fiscal  law,  and ethics requirements, launchable from the FM LMS.  Successful completion of these web-based courses meets the FM Certification requirements. (3)  FM  members  may  substitute  similar  courses  to  meet  the  course  requirements,  as long as the courses have been recommended by the FM CFCM and were approved by the FM OFCM  as  adequate  substitutes  in  terms  of  content  and  course  hours.    Substitute  courses  are found on the FM myLearn Website. (a)  Successful completion of these modules and courses by definition meets each individual course requirement, respectively. (b)  Instructions for recording a substitute course within the FM LMS are available on FM Online Website. (4)  The different responsibilities for identifying substitute courses are as follows: (a)  FM OFCM 1.  Develops and distributes instructions for the substitute process. 2.  Publishes and maintains a list of the learning objectives (LOs) and course hours for each course in the Certification Program subject to the substitution process.  3.  Collects courses recommended as substitutes by the DoD Components for courses in the Certification Program.  4.  Approves and posts substitute courses on the FM myLearn Website and the FM LMS, as appropriate.        (b)  FM CFCM instruction for which they are the proponent. 1.  Identifies courses that meet the substitution requirements in this format designated by the FM OFCM. 2.  Recommends substitute courses to the FM OFCM for approval in the 3.  Periodically reviews “substitutable” training to ensure it remains current. (5)  The process for identifying a substitute course is: 32 ENCLOSURE 3               DoDI 1300.26_AFI65-117  23 February 2016   (a)  The FM CFCM identifies an internally developed candidate course for substitution for one of the courses in the Certification Program that is subject to substitution. (b)  The FM CFCM identifies the LOs of the candidate course and compares them to the LOs of the course for which it is intended to substitute (referred to as the “target course”). The DoD Component determines whether the LO content of the candidate course is the same as most of the LO content of the target course. (c)  If the FM CFCM determines that most of the content of the LOs of the candidate course matches the target course, then he or she measures the course hours of the candidate course that are associated with that content. (d)  The FM CFCM submits the substitute course information to the FM OFCM in the proper format.  Templates for submitting substitute course information are available on FM Online Website. (e)  The FM OFCM receives the submission, confirms validity, approves or disapproves the submission, and posts the approved courses as substitutes in the course inventory on the FM myLearn Website and the FM LMS. (f)  The FM OFCM retains documentation for all substitute submissions.  Exception to Policy         (1)  In the case of an FM member who asserts completion of FM or leadership courses required to complete a competency, but is unable to provide verification or documentation of such course, the supervisor may sign a memorandum for the record (MFR) for the FM member to use as documentation in the FM LMS.  The MFR must reflect the basis of granting the achievement, including source of third-party verification when feasible.  (2)  This exception policy is time-limited.  FM members are permitted to request exceptions only in their initial 2 years in the Certification Program. (3)  The exceptions to policy MFRs are subject to audits. 33 ENCLOSURE 3 DoDI 1300.26_AFI65-117 23 February 2016  APPENDIX 1 TO ENCLOSURE 3               DoD FM LMS 1.  FM LMS OVERVIEW a.
