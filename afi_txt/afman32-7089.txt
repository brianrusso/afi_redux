Introduction.  The  EPA  initially  developed  regulations  for  the  management  of  ozone-depleting  substances  (ODS)  in  1990  under  Title  VI  of  the  Clean  Air  Act  (CAA).  These regulations  are  contained  within  40  CFR  Part  82.  These  rules  cover  all  areas  of  refrigerant management and use and are applicable to all Air Force, Reserve, ANG, and government-owned contractor-operated  (GOCO)  activities,  equipment,  systems,  and  products  located  within  the United States and its territories. 1.2.  Purpose.  All  Air  Force  installations,  regardless  of  size,  with  refrigeration  and/or  comfort cooling  equipment  must  manage  and  maintain  equipment  and  refrigerant  stockpiles  in  such  a way  as  to  ensure  both  mission  success  and  compliance  with  applicable  environmental regulations.  The  purpose  of  this  manual  is  to  provide  direction  and  methodologies  to  assist installation personnel in managing all facets of refrigerants at their installations and function as an Air Force-wide refrigerant management plan. 1.3.  Intended Audience.  This manual is intended to assist installation CE personnel who work with  refrigerants,  perform  maintenance  on,  or  are  responsible  for,  facility  design,  planning,  or environmental oversight and compliance activities for equipment regulated under Title VI of the CAA  (e.g.,  chillers,  air  conditioners,  refrigeration  units).  This  manual  is  a  guide  for  tenant organizations  who  do  not  receive  equipment  service  support  from  installation  CE  on  how  to comply  with  EPA  and  installation  requirements  within  their  native  organization  and  meet  Air Force requirements within the framework of their support agreement. 1.4.  Applicability.  This  manual  is  intended  to  address  stationary  equipment  containing refrigerants  installed  on  Air  Force  installations  used  for  the  purposes  of  comfort  cooling, commercial  refrigeration,  or  industrial  process  cooling.  Refrigerants  in  MVAC  or  aircraft refrigeration  systems  are  managed  by  other  programs  and  are  not  included  in  the  scope  of  this manual. 1.5.  Legal Drivers. 1.5.1.  Legal requirements for the management of refrigerants are defined in 40 CFR Part 82. These regulations were initially published in 1990 and have been amended multiple times by the  EPA.  Air  Force  installations  are  subject  to,  and  therefore  must  comply  with,  all provisions of the CAA; failure to comply can result in both civil and criminal penalties of up to $37,500 per non-compliance per day. Major sections of Title VI of the CAA are included in Table 1.1. Table 1.1.  Major Section the Clean Air Act.

Air Force Refrigerant Management Program.  This manual is intended to function as the Air Force-wide Refrigerant Management Plan and, to the maximum extent possible, standardize refrigerant  management  operations  across  the  Air  Force.  All  refrigerants  and  associated processes  must  follow  the  process  authorization  procedures  IAW  AFI  32-7086,  Hazardous Materials Management.  Unless otherwise required by law, each installation is no longer required to develop and maintain individual refrigerant management plans; all installations must maintain all  refrigerant  management  records  within  APIMS,  including  current  equipment  inventory  and document  planned  replacement  dates.  Installations  must  continue  to  plan,  program,  and  budget for  air  conditioning/refrigeration  (AC/R)  equipment  replacement  using  sound  lifecycle engineering practices and track programs in APIMS. (T-1). 1.7.  Scope of Requirements.  Although the installation base civil engineer (BCE) is tasked with maintaining  only  equipment  owned  by  CE,  legal  requirements  and  the  requirements  in  this manual  are  applicable  to  all  real  property  installed  equipment  (RPIE)  or  real  property  similar equipment (RPSE) containing refrigerant  and the management of that equipment on Air Force-owned or -managed installations. As such, the BCE must ensure personnel become familiar with the requirements of host-tenant agreements and are aware of areas where support is required by those agreements. (T-1).  Additionally, all tenant organizations must ensure that refrigerants are managed and maintained in accordance with all legal and Air Force requirements. The BCE must ensure the roles and responsibilities of all parties are recorded in appropriate support agreements. (T-1). 1.8.  Phase-Out  of  Class  I  and  Class  II  Refrigerants.  There is no reason to make equipment replacement  decisions  based  solely  on  the  type  of  refrigerant  used  in  an  item  of  equipment; however,  other  factors  must  be  considered  when  determining  whether  to  retain  or  select equipment with a particular refrigerant. The most important selection criteria include equipment efficiency  and  condition;  based  on  past  refrigerant  phase-outs,  refrigerant  inventory  and availability should not be an issue if existing refrigerants are recovered and reused as equipment is decommissioned. Therefore, with common refrigerants still available today, selection criteria should be heavily weighted towards equipment efficiency and condition factors. Based on United Nations  Environment  Programme  (UNEP)  protocols,  the  refrigerant  phase-outs  continue. Though HCFC-22 equipment is no longer manufactured, the refrigerant itself is still available for purchase.  HCFC-22  refrigerant  is  expected  to  remain  relatively  plentiful,  though  production levels will be reduced until production ends in 2020. HCFC-123 refrigerant will end production in 2030. The only remaining Class II refrigerant-containing equipment still being manufactured are HCFC-123 chillers. Manufacturing of this equipment will end in 2020. Tables 1.2 and 1.3 are comprehensive listings of Class I and II compounds that could be used as refrigerants, although some may not be used in the Air Force.   6 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 Table 1.2.

All  recordkeeping systems  must  be  approved  by  the  CE  environmental  element,  and  ensure  it  meets  all requirements. AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 11 Chapter 3 REFRIGERANT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 3.1.  Technician Certification.  All technicians working on AC/R equipment containing Class I or Class II refrigerants must satisfy EPA training and certification requirements imposed by Title VI of the Clean Air Act. 3.1.1.  Requirements.  A  technician  is  any  person  who  performs  maintenance,  service, repair,  or  system  removal  that  could  be  reasonably  expected  to  release  refrigerants  from appliances,  except  for  MVAC,  into  the  atmosphere.  Apprentices  are  exempt  from  this requirement  provided  the  apprentice  is  closely  and  continually  supervised  by  a  certified technician  while  performing  any  maintenance,  service,  repair,  or  disposal  that  could reasonably  be  expected  to  release  refrigerant  from  appliances  into  the  environment.  The supervising  certified  technician  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the  apprentice  complies  with  all EPA  requirements.  The  EPA  has  proposed  extending  the  certification  requirements  for technicians who work with CFC and HCFC refrigerants to technicians who work with HFCs. Technicians certified to work with CFCs and HCFCs would not have to be retested to work with  HFCs,  but  new  technicians  entering  the  field  would  have  to  pass  a  test  to  work  with CFCs, HCFCs, and/or HFCs. 3.1.2.  Certification  Types.  The  EPA  has  developed  four  types  of  certification.  All refrigerant  technicians  must  be  certified  by  an  EPA-approved  technician  certification program in accordance with the following classifications and types: 3.1.2.1.  Type I:  Required for servicing small appliances. 3.1.2.2.  Type  II:  Required  for  servicing  or  disposing  of  high-pressure  and  very-high-pressure appliances, excluding small appliances and MVAC. 3.1.2.3.  Type III:  Required for servicing or disposing of low-pressure appliances. 3.1.2.4.  Universal:  Permits servicing all types of appliances. 3.1.3.  Documentation Requirements. 3.1.3.1.  All  military  and  civil  service  technicians  opening  refrigerant  appliances  for maintenance, service, repair, or disposal must be certified as Universal technicians upon completion of the AFSC 3-level awarding technical school or upon hire into civil service. (T-0).  Base  operations  support  (BOS)  contract  personnel  must  be  certified  to  the appropriate  level  for  tasks  performed  prior  to  the  BOS  contract  start  date.  (T-0). Documentation must be maintained in APIMS and available for inspection. (T-0).  3.1.3.2.  Service contractors must provide copies of appropriate certification required for the  type  of  work  accomplished  with  a  record  of  refrigerant  service  being  performed  on Air  Force  installations.  This  must  be  provided  to  the  installation  CE  environmental element. Tenant units not under the purview of the installation CE, must coordinate any service  contract  work  planned  and  accomplished  with  the  installation  environmental element. (T-0).    12 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 3.2.  Refrigerant  Inventory  Management.  Documentation  and  control  of  the  refrigerant inventory is the foundation of an effective refrigerant management program. Knowing how much refrigerant  is  on  hand,  how  much  has  been  used,  and  what  needs  to  be  ordered  ensures  that enough refrigerant will be available for equipment maintenance or replacement to meet mission requirements. Class I refrigerants for facility AC/R must be supplied only from the existing CE stocks. (T-1). Existing equipment containing Class I refrigerants must be managed to the end of their service lives or until Class I refrigerant inventories are below critical levels. Once all Class I equipment has been decommissioned or retired, the Class I refrigerants must be transferred to the  Defense  Logistics  Agency  (DLA)  through  the  logistics  readiness  squadron’s  hazardous materials  pharmacy  (LRS  HAZMART).  (T-1).  Since  Class  II  refrigerant  production  is  being phased  out,  with  eventual  elimination  by  the  year  2030,  diminishing  supplies  of  Class  II refrigerants will require close management of refrigerant inventories to ensure adequate supplies of  refrigerant  are  available  to  meet  Air  Force  mission  requirements.  Additionally,  managing inventories of all refrigerants will help reduce costs associated with the service and maintenance of AC/R equipment. 3.2.1.  Refrigerant Inventory List. An inventory of all refrigerants, regardless of type, used in  the  maintenance  of  the  AC/R  units  at  an  installation  must  be  developed  and  maintained. (T-1). The inventory must be accomplished for each refrigerant. A refrigerant transaction log must  be  maintained  for  each  refrigerant  to  determine  actual  consumption  rates,  and  must follow requirements in  AFI 32-7086.  Inventory  should be managed in  EESOH-MIS, unless there is a waiver or exemption in AFI 32-7086.  (T-1). 3.2.2.  Recording of Refrigerant Servicing. The BCE must establish a process to ensure the refrigerant  maintenance  event,  including the amount  of refrigerant  used to  service an AC/R unit, is recorded in APIMS within 10 business days. (T-1). 3.2.3.  Leakage  Rate  Calculation.  The leakage rate calculation is automatically completed by APIMS after the refrigerant added data is entered into the system. There are two methods the  EPA  uses  to  calculate  the  leakage  rate:  the  Annualizing  Method  (LR%Ann),  which  is expressed in terms of the percentage of the appliance’s full charge that would be lost over a 12-month period if the current rate of loss were to continue over that period; and the Rolling Average  Method  (LR%Roll),  which  aggregates  the  amount  of  refrigerant  added  to  the appliance over the past 365 days or since the last time that repairs were made if that period is less than one year. The installation can determine which one is used but the same one must be used for all AC/R on the installation and cannot be switched for convenience. 3.2.3.1.  The BCE must ensure that service logs are entered into APIMS. (T-1). If a leak exceeds  the  EPA  threshold,  APIMS  will  automatically  notify  designated  personnel  to take  appropriate  action.  Leak  rates  and  trends  must  be  evaluated  for  maintenance  and programming actions at least once per year. (T-1). 3.2.3.2.  The  following  is  the  equation  used  by  APIMS  to  calculate  the  Annualizing Method  (EPA  Method  #1)  leakage  rate  (LR%Ann).  See  Figure  3.1  for  a  demonstration calculation. AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 13 Figure 3.1.  Sample Annualized Leakage Rate Calculations.

Determining  Adequate  Inventory  Levels. The determination of adequate inventory levels  must  be  made  by  the  BCE  based  on  certain  criteria  such  as  mission  capability, refrigerant  cost  and  availability,  and  AC/R  equipment  phase-out  timelines.  One  approach may  be  to  take  the  average  of  the  consumption  in  the  past  year,  along  with  the  refrigerant charge  of  the  largest  item  of  equipment,  minus  any  refrigerant  recovered,  to  determine  the minimum  inventory  level  for  each  refrigerant  type.  In  determining  the  minimum  inventory level, consider an additional safety factor equal to the amount of charge associated with the largest critical AC/R unit. 3.2.5.  Refrigerant/Equipment  Replacement  Planning.  Using  the  inventory  changes recorded  in  APIMS,  the  BCE  can  plan  for  the  strategic  and  cost-effective  replacement  of both  ODS  refrigerant-containing  equipment  and  non-ODS  systems  that  show  an  increasing trend in leak rates. Planning the phase-out of Class I and Class II refrigerant equipment will assist  in  meeting  Air  Force  objectives  regarding  the  elimination  of  ODS.  Additionally,  this process  can  be  used  to  establish  equipment  replacement  budgets  and  program  for  system replacement  prior  to  system  failure.  Replacement  decision  criteria  may  include  equipment age,  equipment  condition,  refrigerant  type  and  availability,  equipment  service,  equipment cost, energy efficiency, and operational status. 3.2.5.1.  Equipment Condition. Refer to past equipment service records, refrigerant leak rates,  and  maintenance  costs.  Evaluate  any  maintenance  cost  savings  associated  with equipment replacement. Evaluate if the leakage rate trend is increasing and approaching EPA action thresholds. 3.2.5.2.  Refrigerant Availability.  Evaluate whether current installation inventory of the required  refrigerant  exceeds  the  full  charge  for  a  particular  unit.  If  not,  determine  the percentage  of  the  equipment’s  full  charge  available  and  its  likely  or  historical  leakage rate. Determine the cost to replace lost refrigerant that is increasing each year. Given the limited  availability  of  Class  I  refrigerants,  refrigerant  availability  may  be  a  primary decision  criterion  regarding  Class  I  refrigerant  equipment  replacement.  For  instance,  if there is one remaining item of equipment on base containing Class I refrigerant and there is  little  to  no  inventory  of  that  refrigerant,  equipment  replacement  would  be  a  likely recommendation  (pending  other  decision  criteria).  Equipment  using  HCFC-123,  mostly centrifugal chillers, can be manufactured until 2020 and the refrigerant will be produced until 2030, so it is still a viable option and must be evaluated in the life-cycle cost. Class II unitary equipment consists predominantly of packaged-type, self-contained equipment using  the  direct  expansion  of  a  refrigerant  for  cooling  supply  airflow.  Equipment  types such  as  packaged  rooftop  units  and  split-system  air-conditioners  are  included  in  this category.  The  predominant  refrigerant  utilized  in  this  type  of  equipment  is  HCFC-22. Much  of  this  equipment  contains  refrigerant  charges  of  less  than  50  pounds.  Therefore, before the decision is made to replace HCFC-22 equipment, potential HCFC-22 recovery from equipment containing smaller refrigerant charges must be considered. 3.2.5.3.  Equipment  Service.  Determine  what  impact  this  equipment  has  on  the installation mission. List the consequences of the failure of this equipment. 3.2.5.4.  Equipment  Cost.  The  greater  the  replacement  cost,  the  greater  the  planning horizon  needed  to  obtain  funding,  procure  design  services,  and  schedule  outages.  The AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 15 greater  the  replacement  cost,  the  greater  the  probability  the  end  user  will  have  reduced operational capability in the current facility and need additional coordination planning. 3.2.5.5.  Energy  Efficiency.  Compare  the  potential  energy  savings  by  evaluating  the current  equipment  energy  cost  to  a  similar  new  high-efficiency  unit.  Evaluate  how  it affects the life-cycle cost for operation. 3.2.5.6.  Operational  Status.  Determine  whether  the  equipment  serves  a  primary  or backup  function.  If  equipment  is  primary,  determine  if  the  equipment  has  a  functional backup. The replacement priority may be lower if the equipment serves as a backup and is  a tight,  low-leakage unit. Determine if the equipment  serves a facility that is  planned for disposal or a major change in usage. 3.3.  Refrigerant Recovery, Recycling, and Disposal. 3.3.1.  Recovery,  recycling,  and  reuse  of  Class  I  and  Class  II  refrigerants  will  be accomplished to the maximum extent practicable to ensure responsible use and prevent losses to  the  atmosphere.  All  refrigerants  must  be  recovered/recycled  by  removing  the  refrigerant using  EPA-certified  recovery  equipment  and  storing  it  in  an  approved  container.  (T-0,  40 CFR Part 82).  3.3.2.  Anyone  who  disposes  of  AC/R  equipment  must  recover  the  remaining  refrigerant and/or verify that the refrigerant is evacuated properly as detailed in Attachment 5. (T-0, 40 CFR Part 82)  3.3.3.  Refrigerant may be returned to the appliance from which it is recovered or to another appliance owned by the Air Force without being recycled or reclaimed. (T-0, 40 CFR  Part 82).  3.3.4.  Recovery Equipment. 3.3.4.1.  Base  personnel  who  maintain,  repair,  or  dispose  of  AC/R  equipment  must  use recovery and recycling equipment certified by an EPA-approved testing organization. (T-0). The Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) and Underwriters Laboratory (UL) are two approved organizations. 3.3.4.2.  Contracts  to  purchase  recycling  and  recovery  equipment  for  use  on  Air  Force facilities during the maintenance, service, or repair of appliances containing Class I and Class II refrigerants are to have such equipment certified by an EPA-approved equipment testing organization to meet the applicable requirements and standards of 40 CFR Part 82, Subpart  F,  Section  82.158.  Any  contractor  that  services  heating,  ventilation,  and  air conditioning  (HVAC)  equipment  on  Air  Force-owned  facilities  must  use  certified equipment. (T-0, 40 CFR Part 82).  3.3.4.2.1.  Each  piece  of  equipment  must  have  a  label  stating,  “This  equipment  has been  certified  by  an  approved  equipment  testing  organization  to  meet  EPA’s minimum  requirements  for  recycling  or  recovery  equipment  intended  for  use  with [appropriate category of appliance].” 3.3.4.2.2.  The label must also show the date of manufacture and the serial number (if applicable) of the equipment. 16 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 3.3.4.2.3.  The  label  must  be  affixed  in  a  readily  visible  or  accessible  location,  be made  of  a  material  expected  to  last  the  lifetime  of  the  equipment,  and  present  the required  information  in  such  a  manner  that  it  is  likely  to  remain  legible  for  the lifetime of the equipment. The label must be affixed in such a manner that it cannot be removed from the equipment without damaging the label. 3.3.4.2.4.  The  EPA  has  proposed  standards  for  HFC  recovery  equipment  that  are very  similar  to  the  standards  for  CFC  and  HCFC  equipment.  The  standards  depend upon the saturation pressure of the refrigerant, the size of the appliance in which it is used,  and  the  date  of  manufacture  of  the  recovery  equipment.  Manufacturers  of recycling  and  recovery  equipment  have  stated  that  most  recovery  and  recycling equipment  designed  for  use  with  multiple  CFC  or  HCFC  refrigerants  (e.g.,  12,  22, 500,  and  502)  can  be  adapted  for  use  with  HFC  refrigerants  with  similar  saturation pressures.  Thus,  the  EPA  is  proposing  to  allow  technicians  to  recover  HFCs  using recovery  or  recycling  equipment  designed  for  use  with  at  least  two  CFC  or  HCFC refrigerants of similar saturation pressure. However, recovery or recycling equipment already  used  for  CFC  or  HCFC  equipment  should  not  be  used  for  other  alternate refrigerants to avoid mixing different types of refrigerants. 3.3.4.3.  Use  and  maintain  all  recovery  or  recycling  equipment  in  accordance  with  the manufacturer’s  directions  unless  such  directions  conflict  with  the  requirements  of  the EPA. 3.3.4.4.  Equipment Certification and Registration. 3.3.4.4.1.  All refrigerant recovery and recycling equipment must be certified to meet the standards defined within 40 CFR 82.158.  (T-0).  Installations must certify to the EPA that they have obtained certified recovery and recycling equipment and that they are complying with all applicable requirements of 40 CFR subpart 82.  This one-time notification is required under 40 CFR 82.162 and should be accomplished using EPA Form  7610-31  or  equivalent;  this  form  is  available  on  the  EPA's  refrigerant website. (T-0).    Installations  do  not  need  to  submit  subsequent  notifications  to  the EPA  when  new  refrigerant  recovery  and  recycling  equipment  is  obtained  or  old recovery and recycling equipment is retired. 3.3.4.4.2.  A list of certified refrigerant recovery/recycling/reclaiming equipment that includes manufacturer names, evacuation certification types, the date of certification, and refrigerant type must be available on base. (T-0).  3.3.5.  Reallocation and Disposal of Non-required Class I and II ODS Refrigerants. 3.3.5.1.  “The installation HMMP Team is the focal point for the proper management of refrigerants.    In  addition,  AFI  32-7086,  Hazardous  Materials  Management,  provides guidance on the disposition of unused Class I and Class II ODS.  The installation EMO is the  authoritative  source  for  determining  the  disposition  of  any  excess  refrigerants.    The non-directive process HAZMAT management playbook published on the AF CE Portal, provides additional installation-level ODS management guidance. 3.3.5.2.  Transfers. AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 17 3.3.5.2.1.  The  transfer  of  excess  Class  I  ODS  outside  the  Air  Force,  except  to  the DLA ODS Defense Reserve Stockpile, is prohibited. 3.3.5.2.2.  Class  I  or  Class  II  refrigerant  ownership  cannot  be  sold  or  transferred outside  of  DOD.  Transfers  of  excess  refrigerant  to  other  bases  are  encouraged  and should be arranged through the installation HAZMART. 3.3.5.3.  DLA Turn-ins.  If the BCE identifies excess Class I refrigerants that cannot be reused on the base or reallocated within the MAJCOM, these supplies must be returned to the  DLA  Class  I  ODS  Defense  Reserve  Stockpile  through  the  HAZMART.  (T-1).  An example  of  this  may  be  the  retirement  or  disposal  of  the  last  item  of  equipment containing that refrigerant. 3.3.5.4.  Disposal. 3.3.5.4.1.  Any  refrigerant  contaminated  by  other  refrigerants  that  cannot  be reclaimed is solid waste.  The solid waste refrigerant must, in turn, be characterized to determine whether it is hazardous waste.  The BCE may also use process knowledge and simply declare the refrigerant to be hazardous waste and manifest it appropriately for  final  disposition  IAW  AFI  32-7042,  Waste  Management.    For  this  reason,  it  is imperative that refrigerants are not mixed during recovery. 3.3.5.4.2.  If  a  refrigerant  is  determined  to  require  disposal,  refrigerant  evacuation must  be  accomplished  per  current  EPA  guidelines  provided  by  the  installation HAZMART. 3.4.  Air Conditioning/Refrigeration Equipment Maintenance. 3.4.1.  Maintaining  Equipment  to  Minimize  Refrigerant  Leakage.  There  are  several methods  and  procedures  to  minimize  refrigerant  leakage.  The  recommended  methods  of reducing refrigerant leakage are: follow required EPA practices, general equipment servicing and repair, leak detection methods, and AC/R equipment  modifications. These methods are outlined and described below. 3.4.1.1.  All  persons  disposing  of  appliances,  except  for  small  appliances,  MVAC,  and MVAC-like  appliances,  must  evacuate  the  refrigerant,  including  the  entire  liquid refrigerant, into EPA-approved recovery or recycling equipment. 3.4.1.2.  Technicians  opening  refrigerant  appliances  for  maintenance,  service,  repair,  or disposal must have the appropriate EPA certification. 3.4.1.3.  Use all recovery or recycling equipment  in  accordance with the manufacturer’s directions unless such directions conflict with the requirements of the EPA. 3.4.2.  Venting Prohibitions (All Refrigerants). 3.4.2.1.  Since July 2005, it is an EPA violation to knowingly release any Class I or Class II refrigerant or substitute refrigerant other than carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia, or water into  the  atmosphere.  The  knowing  release  of  a  refrigerant  or  non-exempt  substitute subsequent to its recovery from an appliance is an EPA violation. 3.4.2.2.  “De  minimis”  releases  (as  defined  in  40  CFR  82.154(a)(2))  associated  with good-faith  attempts  to  recycle  or  recover  refrigerants  or  non-exempt  substitutes  are  not subject to this prohibition. 18 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 3.4.3.  Equipment  Servicing  and  Repairs.  Detailed  requirements  and  information  about performing equipment service and repairs are in Attachment 5. 3.4.4.  Leak Detection. 3.4.4.1.  The BCE must develop a leak detection program that matches individual AC/R equipment with a specific type of leak detection. (T-1). The BCE should also develop an equipment leak-check schedule based on the equipment type and leak history and include it  with  the  equipment’s  recurring  work  plan  requirements.  As  more  leaks  occur, equipment checks need to be increased accordingly. 3.4.4.2.  Leak-detection procedures vary from soap bubbles to sophisticated sensors. See Attachment 4 for additional detail. 3.4.4.3.  All  leaks  must  be  scheduled  for  repair.  Leaks  that  exceed  EPA-required  action levels must follow the requirements of section 3.5. (T-0).  3.5.  EPA Repairable Leaks. 3.5.1.  Leak  Identification.  The  EPA  requires  equipment  owners  or  operators  to  promptly calculate the leakage rate each time refrigerant is added to applicable equipment. The leakage rate  will  be  calculated  by  APIMS  automatically  and  automatic  notification  will  be  sent  to designated  personnel.  If  the  system  is  leaking  above  the  threshold,  the  EPA  imposes  strict deadlines for compliance with repairing the leaks or retrofitting/retiring the equipment. EPA notification is  required when repairs or off-line actions cannot  be accomplished in  30 days. (T-0).  3.5.2.  EPA  Leakage  Rate  Thresholds. The thresholds are based on three main equipment categories:  comfort  cooling,  commercial  refrigeration,  and  industrial  process  refrigeration. Comfort  cooling  refers  to  equipment  designed  for  environmental  control  for  occupant comfort.  Commercial  refrigeration  refers  to  refrigeration  appliances  used  in  the  retail  food and  cold  storage  warehouse  sectors.  Industrial  process  refrigeration  refers  to  complex, customized  appliances  used the  chemical,  pharmaceutical,  petrochemical,  and manufacturing industries. This equipment is directly linked to the industrial process. Leakage rates are calculated by APIMS and demonstrated in paragraph 3.2.3. in 3.5.2.1.  Comfort  cooling  refrigeration  equipment  containing  50  pounds  or  more  of refrigerant in any single circuit must have all refrigerant leaks repaired within 30 days if the actual annual leakage rate exceeds 15 percent of the total charge. 3.5.2.2.  Commercial refrigeration equipment containing 50 pounds or more of refrigerant in  any  single  circuit  must  have  refrigerant  leaks  repaired  within  30  days  if  the  actual annual leakage rate exceeds 35 percent of the total charge. 3.5.2.3.  Industrial refrigeration equipment containing 50 pounds or more of refrigerant in any single circuit must have refrigerant leaks repaired within 30 days if the actual annual leakage rate exceeds 35 percent of the total charge.   AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 19 3.5.3.  Leakage Repair.  Class I and Class II refrigeration equipment with leaks that exceed the  leakage  rate  threshold  must  be  repaired,  mothballed,  or  have  a  plan  to  remove  from service  within  30  days  after  discovery.  (T-0).  The  date  of  APIMS  calculation  will  start  the 30-day  clock.  Servicing  records  documenting  the  date  and  type  of  service,  leak  repair calculations,  and  quantity  of  refrigerant  added  must  be  kept  for  a  minimum  of  three  years. (T-0).  3.5.3.1.  If the 30-day compliance requirement cannot be met, the leak must be reported to  the  EPA.  (T-0).  The  EPA  may  grant  additional  time  to  repair  leaks  under  certain circumstances. These circumstances include, but may not be limited to, the following: 3.5.3.1.1.  If  the  refrigeration  appliance  is  located  in  an  area  subject  to  radiological contamination or where shutting down the appliance will directly lead to radiological contamination. 3.5.3.1.2.  If  necessary  parts  are  unavailable  or  if  requirements  of  other  applicable federal, state, or local regulations make a repair within 30 or 120 (for cases requiring industrial process shutdown) days impossible. 3.5.3.1.3.  Instances  where  an  industrial  process  shutdown  is  needed  to  repair  leaks from industrial process refrigeration equipment. 3.5.3.1.4.  Equipment  is  “mothballed.”  System  mothballing  means  the  intentional shutdown  of  a  refrigeration  appliance  undertaken  for  an  extended  period  by  the owners or operators of that facility, where the refrigerant has been evacuated from the appliance  or  the  affected  isolated  section  of  the  appliance,  to  at  least  atmospheric pressure. 3.5.3.1.5.  Equipment repair is unnecessary if a plan to retire or replace the equipment within a year is developed within 30 days after the leak is discovered. This provision also applies to a failed follow-up verification test or after making good-faith efforts to repair the leak(s). 3.5.3.1.6.  If the appliance cannot be repaired or mothballed within 30 days or within 30 days of a failed follow-up verification test, or after making a good-faith effort to repair the leaks, the BCE can develop a one-year retirement or replacement plan for the  leaking  appliance.  The  plan  must  be  entered  into  APIMS  and  a  copy  of  the retirement or replacement plan must to be sent by the base CE environmental element to the EPA within 30 days of discovering the leak. (T-0). Compliance with the 30-day requirement is based on the date the report was postmarked. 3.5.4.  Verification Tests.  Verification tests include both initial and follow-up tests and have provisions with regard to leak repairs that require the evacuation of the equipment or portion of the equipment refrigerant charge. 3.5.4.1.  Initial verification tests are leak tests conducted as soon as practicable after the repair is completed. 3.5.4.2.  Follow-up verification tests are tests that involve checking the repairs within 30 days of the appliance returning to normal operating characteristics and conditions. Initial and  follow-up  verification  can  be  done  in  a  single  service  call,  provided  the  unit  is operating under normal operating conditions. 20 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 3.5.5.  Required Reports for Repairs Requiring More Than 30 Days. 3.5.5.1.  All of the following actions will be entered by the installation CE environmental element into APIMS as a record under the base-wide refrigerant management process and copy to the IST/ANGRC Air Quality Program Manager. (T-1). 3.5.5.2.  EPA  Initial  Report. An initial  report must  be submitted to  the EPA regarding why  more  than  30  days  are  needed  to  complete  repairs.  This  report  must  include  the following: 3.5.5.2.1.  Identification of the facility; 3.5.5.2.2.  Leakage rate; 3.5.5.2.3.  Method used to determine the leakage rate and full charge; 3.5.5.2.4.  Date a leakage rate above the applicable leakage rate was discovered; 3.5.5.2.5.  Location of leak(s) to the extent determined to date; 3.5.5.2.6.  Any repair work completed thus far and the date that work was completed; 3.5.5.2.7.  The reasons why more than 30 days are needed to complete the work and an estimate of when the work will be completed. 3.5.5.2.8.  If  changes  from  the  original  estimate  of  when  work  will  be  completed result  in  extending  the  completion  date  from  the  date  submitted  to  the  EPA,  the reasons  for these changes must be documented and submitted to  the EPA within 30 days of discovering the need for the change. 3.5.5.3.  Leak Repair Plans. The BCE must submit a plan to fix leaks for which repairs are  planned,  but  cannot  be  completed,  to  achieve  a  rate  below  the  applicable  allowable leakage rate prior to the 30- or 120-day point. (T-0). This plan is submitted only after the BCE has originally notified the EPA that the initial completion dates cannot be met. 3.5.5.4.  EPA  Final  Report.  The  BCE  must  maintain  records  of  the  dates,  types,  and results of all initial and follow-up verification tests in APIMS. (T-1). Upon completion of all  repairs,  perform  an  initial  verification  to  confirm  the  leak  is  fixed  with  a  follow-up verification  test.  It  there  is  still  a  leak,  an  interim  report  is  sent  to  the  EPA.  The  final report  is  due  to  the  EPA  30  days  from  the  date  of  the  initial  verification  of  the  repair previously reported to the EPA. Each report must also include the following: (T-0).  3.5.5.4.1.  Identification of the facility; 3.5.5.4.2.  Leakage rate; 3.5.5.4.3.  Method used to determine the leakage rate and full charge; 3.5.5.4.4.  Date leakage rate above the applicable leakage rate was discovered; 3.5.5.4.5.  Location of leak(s) to the extent determined to date; 3.5.5.4.6.  Any repair work completed thus far and the date that work was completed. 3.6.  Records  Management.  The  following  documentation  pertaining  to  refrigerant  leakage compliance  is  required  in  accordance  with  40  CFR  Part  82,  Subpart  F,  Section  82.166,  and  all records will be maintained in APIMS. (T-0).  AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 21 Chapter 4 AIR FORCE APIMS REFRIGERANT MANAGEMENT MODULE 4.1.  APIMS  Refrigerant  Management  Module.  In  order  to  standardize  refrigerant  records management  and  processes  across  the  Air  Force,  all  refrigerant  records  must  be  managed  and maintained  in  the  Air  Force  APIMS  Refrigerant  Management  Module.  (T-1).  These  records include documentation of AC/R equipment inventory, maintenance and repair activities, as well as  any  other  information  as  required  by  local,  state,  or  federal  law,  and  host  nation  FGS  for overseas installations. 4.2.  APIMS  Overview.  Air  Force  APIMS  is  a  centrally  hosted,  web-based  system  for managing environmental compliance data. APIMS is available to users within and outside of the Air Force network and is approved for use on all  government  computers. There is  no software installation necessary; the only requirements are that a user has a connection to the Internet, valid CAC  or  External  Certificate  Authority  (ECA),  and  a  properly  configured  CAC  reader  installed on their computer. 4.3.  APIMS Record Management.  Use of the APIMS application ensures that legally required AC/R records are recorded and cataloged as required by EPA regulations. APIMS is considered to be the system of record for all refrigerant activities. 4.4.  APIMS Training and Support. 4.4.1.  Use of APIMS is supported through a telephone help desk, recurring webinar training events, prerecorded training videos, and a series of quick guides.

Commercial Refrigeration—Per 40 CFR Part 82, Subpart F, Section 82.156(i), the refrigeration appliances utilized in the retail food and cold storage warehouse sectors. Retail food includes the refrigeration  equipment  found  in  supermarkets,  convenience  stores,  restaurants,  and  other  food service  establishments.  Cold  storage  includes  the  equipment  used  to  store  meat,  produce,  dairy products,  and  other  perishable  goods.  All  of  the  equipment  contains  large  refrigerant  charges, typically over 75 pounds. Consumption Rate (CR)—The annual rate at which a refrigerant is lost to leaks and emissions, typically expressed in pounds per year (lb/yr). Disposal—(1)  The  process  leading  to  appliance  disassembly  where  the  appliance  components are reused. (2) The disassembly of any appliance for discharge, deposit, dumping, or placing of its discarded component parts into or on any land or water. (3) The discharge, deposit, dumping, or placing of any discarded appliance into any land or water. Follow-up Verification Test—Per 40 CFR Part 82, Subpart F, Section 82.156(i), those tests that involve  checking  the  repairs  within  30  days  of  the  appliance's  return  to  normal  operating characteristics  and  conditions.  Follow-up  verification  tests  for  appliances  from  which  the refrigerant  charge  has  been  evacuated  means  a  test  conducted  after  the  appliance  or  portion  of the  appliance  has  resumed  operation  at  normal  operating  characteristics  and  conditions  of temperature and pressure, except in cases where sound professional judgment dictates that these tests will be more meaningful if performed prior to the return to normal operating characteristics and  conditions.  A  follow-up  verification  test  with  respect  to  repairs  conducted  without evacuation  of  the  refrigerant  charge  means  a  reverification  test  conducted  after  the  initial verification test and usually within 30 days of normal operating conditions. Where an appliance is not evacuated, it is only necessary to conclude any required changes in pressure, temperature or other conditions to return the appliance to normal operating characteristics and conditions. Full  Charge—The  amount  of  refrigerant  required  for  normal  operating  characteristics  and conditions  of the appliance as determined by using one or  a combination of the following four 26 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 methods: (1) Use the equipment  manufacturer's  determination of the  correct  full  charge for the equipment;  (2)  Determine  the  full  charge  by  making  appropriate  calculations  based  on component sizes, density of refrigerant, volume of piping, and other relevant considerations; (3) Use  actual  measurements  of  the  amount  of  refrigerant  added  or  evacuated  from  the  appliance; and/or  (4)  Use  an  established  range  based  on  the  best  available  data  regarding  the  normal operating characteristics and conditions for the appliance, where the midpoint of the range will serve as the full charge and where records are maintained in APIMS. High-Pressure  Appliance—Uses a refrigerant  with  a liquid  phase saturation pressure between 170 psia and 355 psia at 104 °F. This definition includes, but is not limited to, appliances using R-401A, R-409A, R-401B, R-411A, R-22, R-411B, R-502, R-402B, R-408A, and R-402A. Household  Refrigeration—Refrigerators  and  freezers  intended  primarily  for  household/small work center use. This equipment may be used outside the home and can be found in shops and work centers. Industrial  Process  Refrigeration—Per  40  CFR  Part  82,  Subpart  F,  Section  82.156(i),  this  is complex  customized  appliances  used  in  the  chemical,  pharmaceutical,  petrochemical,  and manufacturing industries. This includes industrial ice machines. Industrial Process Shutdown—Per 40 CFR Part 82, Subpart F, Section 82.156(i), an industrial process  or  facility  temporarily  ceases  to  operate  or  manufacture  whatever  is  being  produced  at that facility. Initial  Verification  Test—For  the  purposes  of  40  CFR  Part  82,  Subpart  F,  Section  82.156(i), those leak tests that are conducted as soon as practicable after the repair is completed. An initial verification  test,  with  regard  to  the  leak  repairs  that  require  the  evacuation  of  the  appliance  or portion of the appliance, means a test conducted prior to the replacement of the full refrigerant charge  and  before  the  appliance  or  portion  of  the  appliance  has  reached  operation  at  normal operating characteristics and conditions  of temperature and pressure. An initial  verification test with  regard  to  repairs  conducted  without  the  evacuation  of  the  refrigerant  charge  means  a  test conducted as soon as practicable after the conclusion of the repair work. Leak  Rate—The rate at which an appliance is losing refrigerant, measured between refrigerant charges. See Chapter 3 for calculation methods. Life-Cycle Cost (LCC)—The total cost associated with the purchase, installation, operating, and maintenance of a system or equipment over its expected life. Low-Loss  Fitting—Any  device  intended  to  establish  a  connection  between  hoses,  AC/R equipment, or recovery or recycling equipment that will close automatically or must be manually closed before disconnecting, thereby minimizing the release of refrigerant to the atmosphere. Low-Pressure  Appliance—An  appliance  that  uses  a  refrigerant  with  a  liquid  phase  saturation pressure below 45 psia at 104 °F. This definition includes, but is not limited to, appliances using R-11, R-123, and R-113. Major  Maintenance,  Service,  or  Repair—Maintenance,  service,  or  repair  that  involves removing  the  compressor,  evaporator,  or  auxiliary  heat  exchanger  coil  or  any  maintenance, service,  or  repair  that  involves  uncovering  an  opening  of  more  than  4  square  inches  of  “flow area” for more than 15 minutes. AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 27 Medium-pressure  Appliance—An  appliance  that  uses  a  refrigerant  with  a  liquid  phase saturation pressure between 45 psia and 170 psia at 104 °F. This definition includes, but is not limited to, appliances using R-114, R-124, R-12, R-401C, R-406A, and R-500. Opening  an  Appliance—Any  service,  maintenance,  or  repair  of  an  appliance  that  could  be reasonably expected to release refrigerant to the atmosphere unless the refrigerant was previously recovered from the appliance. Reclaim Refrigerant—To reprocess refrigerant to all of the specifications in Appendix A to 40 CFR  Part  82,  Subpart  F  (based  on  AHRI  Standard  700-2015,  Specifications  for  Refrigerants), that are applicable to that refrigerant and to verify that the refrigerant meets these specifications using  the  analytical  methodology  prescribed  in  Section  5  of  Appendix  A  of  40  CFR  Part  82, Subpart F. Recover Refrigerant—To remove refrigerant in any condition from an appliance and to store it in an external container without necessarily testing or processing it in any way. Recycle  Refrigerant—To  extract  refrigerant  from  an  appliance  and  clean  refrigerant  for  reuse without  meeting  all  of  the  requirements  for  reclamation.  In  general,  recycled  refrigerant  is refrigerant that is cleaned using oil separation and single or multiple passes through devices such as  replaceable  core  filter-driers,  which  reduce  moisture,  acidity,  and  particulate  matter.  These procedures are usually implemented at the field job site. Refrigerant—Any substance consisting in part or whole of a Class I or Class II ODS or an EPA-approved alternative, used in a heat cycle that undergoes a phase change between gas and liquid to allow cooling, as in refrigerators, air conditioners, etc. Refrigerant  Circuit—Parts  of  an  appliance  that  are  normally  connected  to  each  other  (or  are separated only by internal valves) and are designed to contain refrigerant. Self-contained  Recovery  Equipment—Refrigerant  recovery  or  recycling  equipment  that  is capable  of  removing  the  refrigerant  from  an  appliance  without  the  assistance  of  components contained in the appliance. Small  Appliance—Any  appliance  that  is  fully  manufactured,  charged,  and  hermetically  sealed in  a  factory  with  5  pounds  or  less  of  a  Class  I  or  Class  II  substance  used  as  a  refrigerant, including,  but  not  limited  to,  refrigerators  and  freezers  (designed  for  home,  commercial,  or consumer  use),  medical  or  industrial  research  refrigeration  equipment,  room  air  conditioners (including  window  air  conditioners  and  packaged  terminal  air  heat  pumps),  dehumidifiers, under-the-counter ice makers, vending machines, and drinking water coolers. Substitute—Any chemical or product, whether existing or new, that is used by any person as an EPA-approved  replacement  for  a  Class  I  or  II  ozone-depleting  substance  (ODS)  in  a  given refrigeration or air-conditioning end-use. Technician—Any  person  who  maintains,  services,  or  repairs  AC/R  equipment  that  could reasonably be expected to release refrigerants to the atmosphere. Must be certified by the EPA. Very-High-Pressure  Appliance—AC/R  equipment  that  uses  a  refrigerant  with  a  critical temperature below 104 °F or with  a liquid  phase saturation pressure above 355 psia at  104 °F. This definition includes, but is not limited to, appliances using R-13 or R-503.  28 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 Attachment 2 UPDATE ON REFRIGERANTS: TRANSLATING THE LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND POLICIES INTO PRACTICE A2.1.  The  Montréal  Protocol.  Since  1974,  atmospheric  scientists  worldwide  have substantiated  and  refined  the  hypothesis  confirming  the  long-term,  negative  consequences  of CFC  use.  In  response  to  scientists'  concerns,  representatives  of  35  nations  met  in  1987  at  the United  Nations  Environment  Programme  (UNEP)  in  Montréal  and  established  an  international protocol  for  restricting  CFC  and  halon  production.  Representatives  from  93  nations  met  in London  in  1990  to  revise  the  Montréal  Protocol  because  of  new  information  regarding  ozone destruction.  This  meeting  accelerated  the  CFC  phase-out.  UNEP's  November  1992  meeting  in Copenhagen  accelerated  the  phase-out  schedules.  The  Montréal  Protocol  representatives generally  meet  every  year  to  assess  the  status  of  ODS  reduction  efforts  and  consider  new recommendations.  The  2007  meeting  increased  the  pace  of  the  R-22  phase-out.  The  2008 meeting urged the use of natural refrigerants such as carbon dioxide (CO2). A2.1.1.  Phase-Out Schedules.  Under the Montreal Protocol, HCFC refrigerants were to be reduced  by  90  percent  from  their  baseline  by  2015.  The  current  schedule  sets  future milestones  of  99.5%  reduction  by  2020  with  use  of  HCFCs  being  phased  out  by  2030.  By 2020,  the  production  of  all  new  HCFC  refrigerants  will  cease.  In  addition,  manufacturing new equipment using HCFC refrigerants was banned beyond January 2010. The exception is HCFC-123. Equipment designed to use HCFC-123 can be produced until January 2020. The refrigerant itself will be produced until 2030. A2.1.2.  Applicable CFCs.  The CFC refrigerants used by the Air Force for AC/R units that are affected by the Montréal  Protocol  include CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-500, CFC-501, CFC-502, and CFC-503. A2.1.3.  Applicable  HCFCs.  The  most  widely  used  HCFC  refrigerants  affected  by  the Montréal Protocol are HCFC-22 and HCFC-123. A2.2.  Clean  Air  Act  Amendments.  Table  A2.1  shows  the  current  phase-out  schedule  for HCFCs, including the change at the Montréal Protocol meeting in 2007. Table A2.1.  Current Phase-Out Schedule for HCFCs.

Overview.  A  refrigerant  recycling  requirement  overview  of  CAA,  Section  608, follows. It includes the final regulations published in the 14 May 1993 Federal Register, 40 CFR  Part  82  (2008).  The  prohibition  against  venting  became  effective  1  July  2008.  These requirements  directly  impact  base  CE  daily  activities.  For  additional  information  visit  the EPA  website:  https://www.epa.gov/ozone-layer-protection.  The  following  summarizes these procedures: A2.3.1.1.  Require  service  practices  that  maximize  ODS  recovery  or  recycling  during servicing and disposal of AC/R equipment. A2.3.1.2.  Establish  certification  requirements  for  technicians  and  recycling,  recovery, and reclaiming equipment. A2.3.1.3.  Confine Class I and Class II ODS refrigerant sales to certified technicians. A2.3.1.4.  Require that substantial leaks in AC/R equipment with a refrigerant charge of 50 pounds or greater in a refrigerant cylinder be repaired. A2.3.1.5.  Establish  safe  disposal  requirements  for  small  appliances,  such  as  home refrigerators  and  room  air-conditioners,  which  typically  enter  the  waste  stream  with  an intact charge. A2.3.2.  Prohibition on Venting.  Effective 13 June 2005, no person maintaining, servicing, repairing,  or  disposing  of  appliances  may  knowingly  vent  or  otherwise  release  into  the environment  any  appliance’s  refrigerant  or  its  substitute.  The  exceptions  include  nitrogen, water,  ammonia,  hydrocarbons,  and  chlorine.  Some  industrial  uses  are  not  affected.  This applies to HFC refrigerants, including, but not limited to, R-134a and R-410a. A2.3.3.  Service  Practice  Requirements.  The  EPA  established  requirements  that  must  be met when servicing AC/R equipment. A2.3.3.1.  Technicians  are  required  to  evacuate  AC/R  equipment  to  established  vacuum levels.  If  the  technician's  recovery  or  recycling  equipment  was  manufactured  before  15 November  1993,  the  AC/R  equipment  must  be  evacuated  to  the  levels  indicated  in  the first  column  of  Table  A5.1.  The  recovery  or  recycling  equipment  must  have  been certified  by  an  EPA-approved  equipment  testing  organization  (see  40  CFR  Part  82 [2008],  Subpart  F,  156  to  158).  Technicians  repairing  small  appliances,  such  as household refrigerators, household freezers, and water coolers, are required to recover 80 to 90 percent of the system refrigerant, depending on the system's compressor status. 30 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 A2.3.3.2.  The EPA has established limited exceptions to its evacuation requirements for minor repairs and repairs of leaking equipment not followed by an equipment evacuation into the environment. If evacuation to the level described in Table A5.1 is not attainable, or  would  significantly  contaminate  the  recovered  refrigerant,  persons  opening  the appliance  must  isolate  the  leaking  components  from  the  non-leaking  components whenever possible; evacuate non-leaking components to the levels shown in Table A5.1; and  evacuate  leaking  components  to  a  level  that  will  not  significantly  contaminate  the refrigerant (≤ 0 psig). A2.3.3.2.1.  If evacuation of the equipment to the environment will not be performed when repairs are complete, and if the repair is not major, then the appliance must be evacuated  to  at  least  0  psig  before  it  is  opened  if  it  is  a  high-pressure  or  very-high-pressure  appliance,  or  be  pressurized  to  0  psig  before  it  is  opened  if  it  is  a  low-pressure  appliance.  Methods  that  require  subsequent  purging  (e.g.,  nitrogen)  cannot be used. A2.3.3.2.2.  Major  repairs  include  the  removal  of  a  compressor(s),  condenser, evaporator, or auxiliary heat exchanger coil. A2.3.3.3.  The  EPA  permits  the  return  of  recovered  and/or  recycled  refrigerant  to  the same system or other systems owned by the same person without restriction. If refrigerant changes ownership, the refrigerant must be reclaimed. (It must be reclaimed according to purity  standards  of  AHRI  700-2015,  Specification  for  Refrigerants,  and  chemically analyzed to confirm it meets that standard.) A2.3.4.  Equipment Certification. A2.3.4.1.  The  EPA  has  created  a  certification  program  for  recovery/recycle  equipment. Under  the  program,  the  EPA  requires  that  equipment  manufactured  on  or  after  15 November 1993 undergo tests administered by an EPA-approved testing organization to verify it meets the EPA’s requirements. Recycling and recovery equipment intended for use with AC/R equipment other than small appliances must be tested by the manufacturer according  to  AHRI  740-2016,  Performance  Rating  of  Refrigerant  Recovery  Equipment and  Recovery/Recycling  Equipment.  Recovery  equipment  designed  for  small  appliances must also be tested to comply with AHRI 740-2016. A2.3.4.2.  The EPA requires recovery efficiency  standards that vary based on the AC/R equipment size and type being serviced. For recovery and recycling equipment designed for  AC/R  equipment  other  than  small  appliances,  the  standards  are  identical  to  those shown  in  the  second  column  of  Table  A5.1.  Recovery  equipment  intended  for  small appliances  must  recover  90  percent  of  the  refrigerant  in  a  small  appliance  while  the appliance’s compressor is operating or 80 percent if the compressor is not operating. A2.3.5.  Grandfathering Equipment.  Equipment manufactured before 15 November 1993, including  homemade  equipment,  will  be  grandfathered  if  it  meets  the  standards  in  the  first column of Table A5.1. Third-party testing is not required for equipment manufactured before 15 November 1993 (see paragraph A2.3.4). A2.3.6.  Refrigerant  Leaks.  Owners  of  equipment  with  charges  of  50  pounds  or  more  of refrigerant per refrigerant circuit must repair leaks that exceed the annual maximum leakage rate  of  15  percent  for  comfort  cooling  and  35  percent  for  commercial  refrigeration  and AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 31 industrial process equipment within 30 days. If the owner is unable to repair the equipment, a retirement  plan  must  be  developed  within  30  days  and  implemented  within  12  months.  A copy  of  the  plan  must  be  present  with  the  equipment.  Upon  completion  of  the  repair,  a follow-up  verification  must  occur  within  30  days.  Owners  must  maintain  records  of  the refrigerant  quantity  added to  their equipment  during servicing and maintenance procedures. All service records must be entered into the Air Force APIMS system in accordance with this manual. Information about APIMS is in Chapter 4 of this manual. A2.3.7.  Mandatory  Technician  Certification.  The  CAA  of  1990,  Title  VI,  Section  608, imposes  requirements  for  training  and  certifying  technicians  involved  in  maintaining  and servicing  refrigeration  systems  with  CFC  or  HCFC  refrigerants.  Technicians  servicing MVAC must also be certified to work with R-134a. The best practice for the Air Force is to train and certify all technicians working with any refrigerants. A2.3.7.1.  The EPA has four types of certification: A2.3.7.1.1.  Type I: Required for servicing small appliances. A2.3.7.1.2.  Type  II:  Required  for  servicing  or  disposing  of  high-pressure  or  very high-pressure appliances, except small appliances and MVAC. A2.3.7.1.3.  Type III: Required for servicing or disposing of low-pressure appliances. A2.3.7.1.4.  Universal: Approved for servicing all equipment types. A2.3.7.2.  Technicians, as defined in 40 CFR 82, Subpart F, 82.15, who service or repair small appliances must have Type I certification. A2.3.7.3.  Technicians  must  pass  an  EPA-approved  test  administered  by  an  EPA-approved  certifying  organization.  Technicians  must  be  certified  to  be  able  to  maintain, service,  and  repair  AC/R  equipment.  Apprentice  technicians  working  in  an  approved program under the direction of a certified technician do not require certification. A2.3.8.  Refrigerant  Sales  Restrictions.  Any  CFC  or  HCFC  refrigerant  sold  in  any  size container will be restricted to technicians certified by an EPA-approved program. A2.3.9.  Registration  by  Owners  of  Recycling  and  Recovery  Equipment.  The  EPA requires that  persons  who service or dispose of  AC/R equipment  must notify (register their equipment)  the  EPA  that  they  have  purchased  and  use  recovery  or  recycling  equipment certified  to  meet  EPA  requirements  and  that  they  are  complying  with  the  applicable requirements of EPA Section 608, Refrigerant Recycling Rule (40 CFR Part 82, Subpart F). The initial registration form, EPA Form 7610-31, Refrigerant Recovery or Recycling Device Acquisition  Certification  Form,  must  be  signed  by  the  equipment’s  owner  or  another responsible  officer  and  sent  to  the  appropriate  EPA  regional  office.  This  form  serves  as  an initial notification only; equipment owners are not required to, and therefore should not, send in  a  new  form  each  time  they  add  or  remove  recycling  or  recovery  equipment  to  their inventory. Although recycling and recovery equipment owners are required to list the number of trucks based at their shops, they do not need an item of recycling or recovery equipment for every truck. A2.3.10.  Safe Disposal Requirements. 32 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 A2.3.10.1.  Under  the  EPA’s  rule,  equipment  that  is  typically  dismantled  onsite  before disposal  (e.g., retail  food refrigeration, cold  storage  warehouse refrigeration, chillers, or industrial  process  refrigeration)  must  have  its  refrigerant  recovered  according  to  the EPA's servicing requirements. However, equipment that typically enters the waste stream with  the  charge  intact  (e.g.,  household  refrigerators,  freezers,  room  air-conditioners)  is subject to special safe disposal requirements. A2.3.10.2.  Under  these  requirements,  the  final  person  in  the  disposal  chain  (e.g.,  scrap metal  recycler,  landfill  owner)  must  ensure  the  refrigerant  is  recovered  before  final disposal of the equipment. If the final person in the disposal chain accepts appliances that no  longer  hold  a  refrigerant  charge,  that  person  is  responsible  for  obtaining  a  signed statement from whom the appliance is being accepted. The signed statement must include the  name  and  address  of  the  person  who  recovered  the  refrigerant  and  the  date  the refrigerant  was  recovered,  or  a  copy  of  a  contract  stating  that  the  refrigerant  will  be removed  before  delivery.  The  signed  statement  or  contract  must  be  available  onsite  for inspection.  The  EPA  does  not  mandate  a  sticker  as  a  form  of  verification  that  the refrigerant  has been removed prior  to  disposal  of the appliance but  such stickers do not relieve the final disposer of their responsibility to recover any remaining refrigerant in the appliance.  Technician  certification  is  not  required  for  individuals  removing  refrigerant from  appliances  prior  to  disposal;  however,  the  equipment  used  to  recover  refrigerant from  appliances  prior  to  final  disposal  must  meet  the  same  performance  standards  as EPA-certified refrigerant recovery equipment used prior to servicing. A2.3.10.3.  Per  EPA  Section  608  of  the  Clean  Air  Act  of  1990,  disposable  cylinders should be emptied (recover the refrigerant until the pressure is reduced to a vacuum). The container’s valve should be closed and the container itself marked as empty; the container is now ready for disposal. It is recommended, but not required, by EPA Section 608 that the cylinder valve be opened afterwards to allow air to enter. The cylinder valve is then broken off while the valve remains open and the cylinder is punctured. This will prevent cylinder misuse by untrained individuals. Once the cylinder has been rendered useless as a refrigerant container, it can be disposed of as scrap metal. For details on disposal rules, refer  to  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT)  Specification  39,  49  CFR  178.65, Specification  39  Non-reusable  (non-refillable)  cylinders, and  Defense  Logistics Agency Instruction  (DLAI)  4145.25,  Storage  and  Handling  of  Liquefied  and  Gaseous Compressed Gasses and Their Full and Empty Cylinders. A2.3.11.  Major  Recordkeeping  Requirements.  The  EPA  recordkeeping  requirements discussed in paragraphs A2.3.11.1 and A2.3.11.2 can be met by using APIMS. All technician certifications and service events must be entered into APIMS. A2.3.11.1.  Technicians servicing appliances containing 50 or more pounds of refrigerant in a refrigerant circuit must provide the owner with an invoice that indicates the amount of  refrigerant  added  to  the  appliance/refrigerant  circuit.  Technicians  must  also  keep  a copy of their proof of certification at their place of business. A2.3.11.2.  Owners  of  appliances  that  contain  50  or  more  pounds  of  refrigerant  in  a circuit  must  keep  service  records  documenting  the  date  and  type  of  service  and  the quantity of refrigerant added to the appliance/refrigerant circuit. AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 33 A2.3.12.  Hazardous  Waste  Disposal.  The  EPA  has  requirements  for  safely  disposing  of refrigerants. A2.3.12.1.  If  refrigerants  are  recycled  or  reclaimed,  they  are  not  considered  hazardous waste under federal law. In addition, used oils contaminated with CFCs or HCFCs are not hazardous waste as long as they are not combined with other waste. A2.3.12.1.1.  CFC-contaminated oils are subject to CFC recycling or reclamation. A2.3.12.1.2.  HCFC-contaminated oils are subject to HCFC recycling or reclamation. A2.3.12.1.3.  Contaminated  oils  are  not  to  be  mixed  with  used  oils  from  other sources. A2.3.12.1.4.  If either CFC or HCFC is not ultimately reclaimed from the oil, manage the  oil  under  40  CFR  279  requirements  or  manage  as  solid  [and  potentially hazardous] waste under 40 CFR 261. A2.3.12.2.  Used  oils  containing  CFCs  after  the  CFC  reclamation  procedure  are, however, subject to specification limits for used oil fuels if they are not burned. A2.3.13.  Enforcement.  The EPA is continually performing random inspections, responding to tips, and pursuing violators. Under the CAA, the EPA is authorized to assess fines of up to $37,500 per day, per event for any violations.  34 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 Attachment 3 REFRIGERANT HANDLING AND STORAGE RECOMMENDATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS A3.1.  Introduction.  All refrigerants should be stored in a controlled environment. For safety, it is important to limit access to refrigerants; some refrigerants are very toxic, flammable, or stored in high-pressure containers. Whenever possible, store refrigerants  at a single location for better control and management. This simplifies refrigerant inventory management and guarantees that essential recordkeeping practices are followed. A3.2.  Refrigerant  Storage  Requirements  –  Enclosed  Space.  Buildings  or  areas  within buildings,  designed  or  used  specifically  as  enclosed  refrigerant  storage  facilities,  must  comply with  ASHRAE  15-2013,  Safety  Standard  for  Refrigeration  Systems.  To  meet  the  refrigerant concentration limits from ASHRAE 15-2013, Section 7.2, storage areas must be designed to the requirements for refrigerating machinery rooms in Section 8.1. These requirements include, but are  not  limited  to,  refrigerant  storage  facility  ventilation  and  exhaust  requirements,  refrigerant monitors,  and  alarms.  ASHRAE  15-2013  limits  the  amount  of  refrigerant  stored  in  containers without relief valves and piping to not more than 330 pounds of refrigerant. All refrigerants must be stored in approved containers. A3.3.  Refrigerant  Storage  Recommendations  –  Open  Space.  There  are  no  specific  code requirements for refrigerant storage in non-enclosed areas other than following safe refrigerant-handling  practices.  Storage  areas  must  have  limited  access.  The  following  practices  are recommended: A3.3.1.  All storage areas should be roofed for protection from weather extremes and be large enough to shield the refrigerant containers from  direct sunlight. At a minimum, enclose the area with a chain-link fence for security. A3.3.2.  An open enclosure should be a stand-alone entity. A3.3.3.  If an enclosure is located adjacent to a building that shares a common wall and the remaining sides are open, do not install a door in the common wall within the confines of the enclosure. A3.4.  Refrigerant  Health  and  Safety  Issues.  There  are  many  health  and  safety  issues associated with all refrigerants and HCFC refrigerants. Technicians or anyone with the potential to  be  working  with  or  around  refrigerants  should  complete  a  training  program  that  meets  the minimum  guidelines  approved  by  the  installation  bioenvironmental  engineering  (BEE)  flight. This  training  must  be  provided  and  documented  per  installation  guidelines  and  policies.  The following section provides general information as a guideline to these hazards and references to assist in selecting sensing devices. A3.4.1.  Physical  Properties  of  Refrigerants.  Table  A3.1  provides  an  overview  of  the refrigerants used in AC/R applications, including the type and designation number, chemical formula,  boiling  point,  threshold  limit  value  (TLV),  short-term  exposure  limit  (STEL), immediately  dangerous  to  life  and  health  (IDLH),  and  occupational  exposure  limit  (OEL) information.  This  information  can  help  set  alarm  limits  or  required  detection  devices.  For details  needed  to  design  a  storage  area,  the  designer  must  use  the  most  current  version  of ASHRAE  15  to  determine  volume  of  mechanical  ventilation  required  and  where  to  set  an AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 35 oxygen  sensor.  Ventilation  for  the  machinery  room  is  addressed  in  ASHRAE  15-2013, Section 8.11.5. A3.4.1.1.  The boiling point in Table A3.1 is the temperature at which the refrigerant will boil off as a gas at atmospheric pressure. A3.4.1.2.  The  various  refrigerant  concentration  levels  at  which  an  individual  can  be safely  exposed  are  usually  time-dependent.  In  Table  A3.1,  these  levels  are  indicated  by the TLV, STEL, IDLH and OEL columns, and are expressed in parts per million (ppm). The levels for TLV and STEL are established and published by the American Conference of  Governmental  Industrial  Hygienists  (ACGIH).  IDLH  values  are  specified  by  the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The OEL is based on the TLV  or  similar  value  from  the  Occupational  Safety  Health  Administration  (OSHA)  or related  industrial  health  organization.  The  TWA  and  OEL  are  time-weighted  averages over  an  eight-hour  work  day.  The  STEL  is  an  acute  hazard  measured  with  a  time-weighted average to not  exceed 15 minutes, four times per work day. The IDLH values represent  a  vapor  concentration  level  that  would  cause  oxygen  concentrations  to  drop below  19.5  percent.  The  data  and  terms  in  this  table  are  for  general  design  reference. Specific  questions  about  hazards  or  health  implications  must  be  submitted  to  the installation BEE flight for assessment, awareness, and authoritative answer. Table A3.1.

Refrigerant Exposure.  Refrigerants handled in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended exposure limits pose no acute or chronic inhalation toxicity hazard. A3.4.3.  Flammability Precautions. A3.4.3.1.  Typical  AC/R  refrigerants  are  nonflammable  and  non-explosive.  However, mixing  refrigerants  with  flammable  gases  (such  as  air)  or  liquids  can  result  in  a flammable  solution.  Therefore,  refrigerants  should  never  be  mixed  with  any  flammable gas  or  liquid.  Refrigerants  should  not  be  exposed  to  open  flames  or  electrical  heating elements.  Though  most  refrigerants  are  not  flammable  at  ambient  temperatures  and atmospheric pressure, tests have shown some types to be combustible at pressures as low as 5.5 psig at 351 °F when mixed with air at volumetric concentrations of generally more than  60  percent  air.  At  lower  temperatures,  higher  pressures  are  required  for combustibility.  Refrigerants  should  not  be  used  or  allowed  to  be  present  with  high concentrations of air above atmospheric pressure. A3.4.3.2.  When  storing  Safety  Group  A2,  B2,  A3,  and  B3  refrigerants,  the  room  must meet  requirements  of  the  National  Fire  Protection  Association  (NFPA)  70,  National Electrical Code (NEC), Class I, Division I. Per ASHRAE 15-2013, the total of all Groups A2,  B2,  A3,  and  B3  refrigerants  other  than  R-717  (ammonia),  must  not  exceed  1100 pounds without approval by the authority having jurisdiction. A3.5.  Disposable  and  Reusable  Refrigerant  Cylinders.  Refrigerants  are  contained  in disposable  and  reusable  shipping  containers  or  cylinders.  Since  the  refrigerant-containing cylinders  can  be  pressurized,  they  are  considered  pressure  vessels.  They  must  comply  with federal and state laws regulating transportation and usage of such containers. Specific guidance on  the  storage  and  handling  of  refrigerant  cylinders  is  found  in  DLAI  4145.25,  Storage  and Handling  of  Liquefied  and  Gaseous  Compressed  Gasses  and  their  Full  and  Empty  Cylinders. Coordinate all movements with the installation HAZMART for current guidance on shipping and disposal procedures. A3.5.1.  Identifying Containers. A3.5.1.1.  Both disposable and reusable cylinders are painted (or otherwise marked) in a color code system. This code was voluntarily established by refrigerant manufacturers to identify their products. Common refrigerant colors and identification are set out in Table A3.2.   38 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 Table A3.2.  Color Code System.

The  shade  of  color  may  vary  from  one  manufacturer  to  another.  Verify contents  by  means  other  than  color.  Every  refrigerant  cylinder  is  silk-screened  with product,  safety,  and  warning  information.  Manufacturer  technical  bulletins  and  Safety Data Sheets  (SDS)  are  available upon request.  Do not  repaint cylinders  with  a different color and used with another refrigerant. Refer to AHRI Guideline N-2015, Assignment of Refrigerant Container Colors. A3.5.2.  Disposable  Refrigerant  Cylinders.  Disposable  cylinders  will  be  stored  in  dry locations  to  prevent  corrosion  and  transported  carefully  to  prevent  abrasion  of  painted surfaces.  They  are  not  to  be  refilled.  When  the  cylinder  is  empty,  ensure  all  pressure  is released to 0 psi. The cylinders should be rendered useless for any purpose by breaking off the  valve  or  puncturing  the  cylinder.  After  the  cylinder  has  been  rendered  incapable  of containing any compressed gas under pressure, it must be disposed of as scrap metal. A3.6.  Transportation,  Labels,  and  Markings  (DOT  Requirements).  All  questions  on transportation, labels, and markings of refrigerant cylinders can be answered by the installation HAZMART.  AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 39 Attachment 4 REFRIGERANT LEAK DETECTION AND ROOM SENSORS A4.1.  Introduction.  Refrigerant leak detection is a key component of minimizing losses to the atmosphere,  which  is  the  goal  of  the  CAA  of  1990  and  subsequent  amendments.  In  addition, ASHRAE  15-2013  requires  appropriate  detection  in  storage  areas  to  protect  the  health  of employees  working  in  that  mechanical  space.  Leaks  are  usually  found  in  tubing,  flanges,  O-rings,  and  other  connections.  Gasket  and  O-ring  improvements  and  better  manufacturing techniques  have  significantly  reduced  leaks  in  AC/R  equipment.  An  ongoing  program  for detecting  leaks  is  the  best  solution  for  managing  refrigerant  losses  during  normal  operations. This attachment provides an introduction to refrigerant leak-detection equipment and techniques. A4.2.  Detection  Sensor  Terminology.  The  following  section  describes  electronic  refrigerant sensor  and  detection  terminology  comparison  criteria:  sensitivity,  detection  limits,  selectivity, and  calibration  stability.  These  are  applicable  to  portable  pinpoint  detectors  and  permanently mounted area monitors. A4.2.1.  Sensitivity. A4.2.1.1.  Device  sensitivity  is  the  amount  of  input  needed  to  change  an  output  signal. For  refrigerant  sensors,  the  refrigerant  vapor  concentration  being  measured  is  displayed on a panel meter, a voltage output, or other display. Highly sensitive refrigerant sensors require little material to generate a large change in output signal. Low-sensitivity sensors need large amounts of material to change the output signal. The sensitivity is affected by the detection method and the material under consideration. A4.2.1.2.  An  ionization  sensor  associated  with  a  particular  material  that  demonstrates high  sensitivity  for  CFC-12  may  have  low  sensitivity  for  HCFC-123  and  very  low sensitivity for HFC-134a. The variations in sensitivity are due to the reduction in chlorine content,  which  is  very  easily  ionized  and  detected,  from  CFC-  to  HCFC-  to  HFC-class compounds. Sensitivity differences of 100x to 1000x have been reported when comparing CFC-12  to  HFC-134a  with  some  ionization-based  sensors.  Another  example  of  this varying sensitivity is an infrared (IR)-based sensor. It has roughly the same sensitivity to CFC-12, HCFC-123, and HFC-134a, which is not the case for an ionization detector. A4.2.2.  Detection  Limit.  Sensitivity  values  are  well  defined  but  refrigerant  sensor sensitivity  values  do  not  exist.  The  most  common  measure  of  sensor  performance  is  the detection limit. It is the minimum amount of material a unit can sense that returns a signal at least  two  times  stronger  than  the  background  noise  level.  A  sensitive  device  does  not necessarily  have  a  low-detection  limit,  but  that  is  usually  the  case.  Area-monitoring application detection limits are measured in ppm. Area monitors have detection limits as low as 1 ppm but are typically 3 ppm to 4 ppm for most compounds. A highly sensitive detector may be able to  accurately  record vapor concentration levels  ranging from  1 ppm  to  2 ppm, while  a  low-sensitivity  detector  may  record  the  same  vapor  using  increments  of  20  ppm  or higher. A refrigerant sensor must match the intended application. For example, an ionization detector  that  claims  a  2-ppm  CFC-12  detection  limit  will  not  work  as  well  when  detecting HFC-134a.  Conversely,  an  ionization  detector  designed  specifically  for  HFC-134a  may  be too sensitive to monitor CFC-12. 40 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 A4.2.3.  Selectivity.  Selectivity  is  the  ability  to  detect  only  one  refrigerant  of  interest without  interference  from  other  compounds.  Area  monitoring  selectivity  requirements  vary with  specific  installations.  This  is  an  important  issue  because  monitors  must  work continuously and they become exposed to refrigerants with potentially more interference in a wider concentration range over a long period of time. A4.2.4.  Calibration  Stability.  Calibration  stability  is  very  important  for  long-term monitoring.  Stability  is  provided  by  electronics  that  read  the  sensor  output.  In  general,  the electronics  should  be  able  to  correctly  interpret  sensor  output  under  all  equipment  room conditions, such as those involving temperature and humidity changes. A4.3.  Leak Detection Tools.  There are several methods available to pinpoint refrigerant leaks, ranging from simple fluorescent dyes to more complex electronic detectors. A4.3.1.  Fluorescent Dyes.  Fluorescent dyes are used in refrigeration systems to detect leaks visible under ultraviolet (UV) light. Fluorescent dyes are available for all refrigerants in use today. The dyes are placed in the refrigeration lubricant when the system is serviced. Select a dye  compound  compatible  with  the  lubricating  oil  in  the  refrigeration  system.  Contact  the refrigerant  supplier  for  recommendations  on  appropriate  dyes  to  ensure  compatibility  with the  refrigerant.  Leaks  are  detected  by  using  a  UV  light  to  search  for  dye  that  has  escaped from  the  system.  The  color  of  the  dye  when  subjected  to  UV  light  is  normally  an  easily visible bright  green or  yellow. Fluorescent dyes  work very well because  large  areas can be rapidly checked by a single individual. A4.3.2.  Electronic  Detection  Equipment.  Electronic  detection  equipment  belongs  in  one of  the  following  categories  according  to  selectivity  criteria:  (1)  nonselective;  (2)  halogen-selective; (3) compound-specific. A4.3.2.1.  Nonselective  Sensors.  These  equipment  sensors  can  detect  any  emission  or vapor  present,  regardless  of  its  chemical  composition.  Detectors  in  this  category  are based  on  electrical thermal  conductivity,  ultrasonic,  or  metal-oxide semiconductors.  These  detectors  are  simple  to  use,  very  rugged,  and  typically inexpensive. Nonselective sensors excel at pinpointing leak locations. ionization, A4.3.2.2.  Halogen-Selective  Sensors.  Halogen-selective  sensors  use  a  specialized sensor  that  allows  the  monitor  to  detect  compounds  containing  fluoride,  chloride, bromide, and iodide without interference from other chemicals. These sensors reduce the number  of  false  alarms  generated  by  non-refrigerant  compounds  such  as  paint  or  gas fumes.  These  durable  detectors  are  easy  to  use  and  have  a  higher  sensitivity  than nonselective  detectors  (detection  limits  are  typically  less  than  5  ppm).  The  detector’s partial specificity makes calibration easy. A4.3.2.3.  Compound-Specific  Sensors.  Compound-specific  sensors  are  complex  and expensive.  They  can  detect  a  single  variety  without  suffering  interference  from  other compounds.  Compound-specific  sensors  are  IR-based.  Newer  types  are  based  on infrared-photo  acoustic  spectroscopy  (IR-PAS).  These  have  detection  limits  around  1 ppm, depending upon the compound detected.   AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 41 A4.3.2.4.  Sensitivity. Most monitors will detect all halogen-based refrigerants, but their sensitivity varies with the specific refrigerant type. Choose the refrigerant for which the detector has the lowest sensitivity. For example, if the unit is monitoring a room that has both R-12 and R-22, choose R-12 when calibrating. Commonly used refrigerants can be divided into four groups based on their sensitivity levels: A4.3.2.4.1.  Highest sensitivity: R-11, -22, -123 A4.3.2.4.2.  Moderate sensitivity: R-502 A4.3.2.4.3.

Continuous  Duty  Area  Monitors.  Electronic  detection  equipment,  used  as  area monitors, check the refrigerant vapor level continuously in an equipment room or other locations where exposure is possible. Monitoring happens for several reasons: to protect personnel health and safety, conserve refrigerant, and protect valuable refrigeration equipment. 42 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 A4.4.1.  Monitor  Characteristics.  If  a  monitor  continuously  samples  air  inside  an equipment room, it should have several capabilities that short-term or leak-checking monitors do  not  require.  These  include  low  0-drift  or  an  auto-zeroing  capability  and  outputs  for triggering  external  alarms  that  alert  appropriate  personnel.  Long-term  monitoring  devices should  remain  stable  inside  the  temperature,  voltage,  humidity,  and  barometric  pressure ranges  they  will  encounter.  Continuous  monitors  should  be  refrigerant-specific  to  prevent nuisance  alarms  generated  by  untargeted  compounds.  Monitors  with  poor  selectivity  will react to compounds other than refrigerants, including cleaning agents or paints. They should require minimal maintenance. A4.4.2.  Considerations  for  Sensors  Selection.  Typically,  sensors  last  approximately  two to  five  years  from  the  installation  date  before  a  new  sensor  is  required.  As  refrigerant detection takes place, the sensor loses some of its ability to detect refrigerant again. Sensor life is mostly determined by how much refrigerant it senses over time. Choose a sensor with a built-in calibration leak detector (a pre-programmed leak for a large selection of gases) to quickly verify the unit’s calibration status. Recalibrate when necessary. To ensure accuracy, the  calibrated  leak  is  adjusted  with  unique  electronics  programmed  into  the  sensor  that correct  for  leak  rate  changes  created  by  temperature  fluctuations.  Several  sensor  types  are used  in  refrigerant-detection  devices,  but  they  can  generally  detect  a  wide  range  of refrigerants. Monitor sensitivity is tuned best for detecting a specific refrigerant. Even after tuning, a monitor will be sensitive to other common refrigerants. Manufacturers often publish cross-sensitivity charts that show how the monitor will react to various chemicals, including other refrigerants, if it is tuned to a specific refrigerant. If you know which refrigerants will be inside the equipment room, it is possible to choose a monitor calibration that will generate alarms at or below those refrigerants’ threshold limit value  – time-weighted average (TLV-TWA).  If  a  proper  calibration  setting  cannot  be  found,  multiple  detectors  are  needed.  For example,  a  monitor  set  that  detects  R-123  would  also  detect  R-134a  at  a  level  that  would generate alarms for both refrigerants below their respective TLV-TWA. A4.4.3.  Monitor  Alarm  Outputs.  ASHRAE  15-2013  requires  monitors  to  activate  an alarm signal if the TLV-TWA limit is reached. Monitors are capable of detecting failures that occur as they operate and should report sensor failures. A4.5.  High-Pressure Leak Test Methods.  There are several methods available for leak-testing equipment  containing  high-pressure  refrigerants.  These  methods  depend  on  the  refrigerant charge and the equipment’s operational status. The following paragraphs describe these methods. A4.5.1.  Operating Equipment With  Refrigerant Charge.  A positive-pressure refrigerant has  sufficient  pressure  within  all  components  of  the  system  to  make  most  external  leaks detectable  using  leak  detectors.  Use  caution  whenever  leak-testing  equipment  is  operating; moving and rotating parts present hazards. A4.5.2.  Idle Equipment With Refrigerant Charge.  A positive-pressure refrigerant can be found using leak detectors if the mechanical room or air pressures are under normal ambient conditions. There is only one method to check for evaporator or condenser tube leaks that use water to transfer heat. The equipment must be isolated from the water piping with the tubes drained  and tube sheet access  plate  removed. Use an eddy  current  analysis  or leak detector (electronic or ultrasonic) to locate leaks. AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 43 A4.5.3.  Equipment  Without  Refrigerant  Charge.  There  are  situations  in  which  leak-testing  needs  to  take  place  after  all  refrigerant  is  lost.  Do  not  pressurize  the  system  with refrigerant  to  see  if  the  leaks  were  repaired.  There  are  also  situations  where  using  system refrigerant  alone  may  be  inadequate  to  detect  leaks.  The  refrigerant  charge  may  have  to  be evacuated  from  the  entire  system  or  a  single  component.  When  leak-testing  a  system  or component where refrigerant has been removed, refer to the guidelines below. A4.5.3.1.  Do not use a refrigerant as a tracer gas. A4.5.3.2.  Use  compressed  dry  nitrogen  to  pressurize  the  system.  WARNING:  Never use compressed air, oxygen, or a flammable gas to pressurize the system! This could cause  an  explosion.  Always  use  a  regulator  when  adding  nitrogen  to  a  system.  Add nitrogen slowly for better mixing with the tracer gas and prevent sweeping the tracer gas away from the access port. To ensure that the rating of the relief valve is not exceeded, a maximum test pressure of 200 psig is recommended. A4.5.3.3.  Whenever  possible,  isolate  and  pressure-test  only  that  part  of  the  system  that requires testing. A4.5.3.4.  After a system is pressurized with nitrogen, allow it to stand for 12 to 24 hours, if possible, to allow the tracer gas to disperse uniformly throughout the system. Once the gas is fully dispersed, check for leaks. A4.6.  Low-Pressure  Leak  Test  Methods.  Leak-testing  equipment  containing  low-pressure refrigerants is more difficult than high-pressure refrigerants. The methods available are discussed in the following paragraphs. A4.6.1.  Operating  Equipment.  There  is  no  way  to  completely  leak-test  a  low-pressure refrigerant system during operation because a large part of the system is under a vacuum. The compressor  discharge  pipe,  condenser,  and  piping  leading  to  the  refrigerant  flow  control valve  are  all  slightly  above  atmospheric  pressure  and  can  be  checked  using  leak  detectors. Use caution when leak-testing operating equipment; be aware of moving and rotating parts. Evaporator  and  condenser  tube  leaks  typically  include  water  leaking  into  the  refrigerant rather  than  the  reverse.  This  happens  because  refrigerant  pressure  is  lower  compared  to chilled and condenser water system pressures. A4.6.2.  Offline  Equipment  Testing.  A  thorough  leak  check  can  be  performed  on  a  low-pressure  refrigerant  system  only  if  the  system  is  not  operating.  Installation  CE  personnel should schedule a maintenance shut-down period of at least 48 hours before a leak test. The test should be timed to negate the test’s impact on the facility. A leak check is not a simple process even when the equipment is offline. The refrigerant pressure will usually be under a vacuum  at  room  temperature.  With  CFC-11,  equipment  is  under  a  vacuum  when  the refrigerant  temperature  drops  below  74  °F.  With  HCFC-123  and  CFC-113,  equipment  is under a vacuum below 82 °F and 117 °F, respectively. A4.6.2.1.  The  refrigerant  pressure  must  be  increased  above  atmospheric  pressure  to detect leaks. Equipment containing refrigerant can no longer be pressurized using a non-condensable  gas  such  as  dry  nitrogen.  The  only  method  to  increase  the  refrigerant pressure above atmospheric pressure is to increase the temperature of the refrigerant. In a constant-volume system this will create a corresponding pressure increase. Increasing the temperature of CFC-11 to 100 °F will produce system pressure of 9 psig. 44 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 A4.6.2.2.  There  are  two  pressure  equalization  system  types  used  to  increase  refrigerant temperature  to  achieve  the  desired  pressure:  the  blanket  heater  and  the  water heater/pump. A4.6.2.3.  Use  caution  when  heating  the  refrigerant  charge.  The  pressure  cannot  exceed the pressure relief valve and/or rupture disk setting, which is normally set at 15 psig, or refrigerant will escape to the atmosphere. Stop adding heat when 8 to 10 psig is reached. A4.6.2.4.  Leak-check  all  gaskets,  fittings,  and  penetrations  using  appropriate  leak detection methods. A4.6.3.  Idle/Standby  Equipment.  A  low-pressure  system  will  usually  be  in  a  vacuum  at typical  room  or  ambient  temperature  when  it  is  not  operating.  Any  leaks  will  be  due  to  air and water vapor entering the chiller instead of refrigerant. An integral pressure equalization system,  blanket  heater,  or  water  heater/pump  can  be  used  for  refrigeration  equipment  that operates  intermittently,  especially  if  the  equipment  remains  on  standby.  Use  these  two methods  for  either  pressure  equalization  or  leak  testing.  It  will  control  the  pressure automatically; its internal pressure is always equal to atmospheric pressure when the chiller is  idle.  This  reduces  or  eliminates  refrigerant  loss.  Another  option  involves  removing  the chiller’s refrigerant charge when chillers are idle for long periods. Store the refrigerant in an appropriate,  certified  tank.  While  idle,  the  chiller  should  be  charged  with  dry  nitrogen  to  a pressure of 1 to 2 psig to prevent moisture accumulation inside the chiller vessels. A4.6.4.  Equipment Without Refrigerant Charge.  Two steps are involved in leak-testing a low-pressure  chiller  without  its  charge.  The  first  step  involves  pressurizing  the  system  to pinpoint leaks. Once completed, a vacuum is applied to ensure the equipment does not leak under its normal negative-pressure operating conditions. Follow these two steps: A4.6.4.1.  Step  1.  Pressurize  the  chiller  to  10  to  13  psig  with  dry  nitrogen  and  use  a soap-and-water  solution  to  check  all  joints.  Leaks  will  appear  when  the  soap  solution bubbles. A4.6.4.2.  Step 2. Evacuate the chiller, using a vacuum pump and gauge to 500 microns of  mercury  absolute.  Once  that  level  is  reached,  allow  the  chiller  to  stand  idle  for  12 hours. There are no leaks if vacuum remains at 800 microns or below. If the reading is at 1200  microns  or  greater  the  unit’s  condition  is  unacceptable  and  further  leak-testing  is required. Repeat until no leakage is demonstrated. A4.7.  Potential Refrigerant Leak Areas. A4.7.1.  During inspections, leak-check the leak-prone system areas for integrity. These areas include  all  area  penetrations  where  refrigerant  is  used  and  all  non-welded  connections. Inspect the following areas: A4.7.1.1.  Motor terminals; A4.7.1.2.  Sight glasses; A4.7.1.3.  Shaft seals; A4.7.1.4.  Schrader cores; A4.7.1.5.  Service, solenoid, and relief valves; AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 45 A4.7.1.6.  Flare fittings; A4.7.1.7.  Gasket joints; A4.7.1.8.  Filter dryers. A4.7.2.  Oil stains on positive-pressure equipment or components indicate leak paths. A4.8.  Additional  References.  Additional  references  are  provided  as  suggested  sources  where more  in-depth  information  can  be  found:  ANSI/ASHRAE  Standard  147-2013,  Reducing  the Release  of  Halogenated  Refrigerants  from  Refrigerating  and  Air-Conditioning  Equipment  and Systems.  46 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 Attachment 5 MAINTENANCE PRACTICES AND EQUIPMENT TO MINIMIZE REFRIGERANT LEAKAGES FROM AIR-CONDITIONING AND REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS A5.1.  Introduction.  Refrigeration  service  and  maintenance  practices  commonly  used  in  the past  resulted in  the routine release of significant  amounts of refrigerant  to  the atmosphere. The Clean  Air  Act  of  1990,  Section  608,  and  subsequent  amendments  require  the  minimization  of refrigerant losses. The EPA established regulations to implement the law under 40 CFR Part 82, Subpart F. This attachment provides key concepts and ideas to assist installations to comply with current EPA regulations. A5.2.  Definitions, Common Terminology, and Requirements. A5.2.1.  Certified Equipment.  Equipment used to handle refrigerants during servicing must be  capable  of  meeting  the  evacuations  levels  listed  in  Table  A5.1  and  must  have  a  visible label that demonstrates it has been tested and certified by a third-party EPA-approved testing organization to meet the requirements of 40 CFR Part 82, Subpart F, Section 82.158. A5.2.2.  Certified Technician.  All individuals who maintain, install, service, or repair AC/R equipment must be certified as described in Chapter 3. A5.2.3.  Low-Loss  Fitting.  Any  device  meant  to  establish  a  connection  between  hoses, AC/R equipment, and recovery/recycling machines. They are designed to close automatically or manually after being disconnected to reduce refrigerant loss from hoses, AC/R equipment, and recovery/recycling machines.  Low-loss fittings should have been  added to  refrigeration equipment connection points and service equipment hoses. A5.2.4.  Non-condensable  Gas  (NCG).  Gases,  which  are  primarily  air,  other  than  the refrigerant  in  the  cooling  system.  Air  Force  cooling  equipment  uses  purge  units  to automatically purge NCGs when the acceptable level is exceeded. A5.2.5.  Purge  Units.  Purge  units  are  used  with  low-pressure  chillers  and  refrigerant recovery  equipment  to  remove  non-condensable  material  that  entered  the  system.  All  low-pressure  chillers  (R-11  or  R-123)  should  have  high-efficiency  purges,  with  capability  to process discharges of 0.7 to 1 pound-refrigerant per pound-NCG. High-efficiency purge units allow non-condensable material to be vented while leaking very little refrigerant. A5.2.6.  Recovery.  Recovery  is  the  removal  of  refrigerant  from  a  system  to  store  it  in  an external  container  without  necessarily  testing  or  processing  it  in  any  way.  Recovery  is mandatory if the system will be opened to the atmosphere. If an equipment component that requires service is isolated, only the isolated equipment section needs to be evacuated. A5.2.7.  Recycling.  Recycling  extracts  refrigerant  from  a  system  and  cleans  refrigerant  for reuse without meeting all of the requirements for reclamation. In general, recycled refrigerant is  refrigerant  that  is  cleaned  using  oil  separation  and  single  or  multiple  passes  through devices, such as replaceable core filter-driers, which reduce moisture, acidity, and particulate matter. Recycling can be useful for drying refrigerants that contain moisture instead of water or for removing particulate matter. A5.2.8.  Reclamation.  Reclamation purifies, tests, and certifies used refrigerant to all of the specifications in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 82, Subpart F (based on AHRI Standard 700-AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 47 2015, Specifications for Refrigerants), that are applicable to that refrigerant and to verify the refrigerant  meets  these  specifications  using the  prescribed  analytical  methodology. Refrigerant  reclamation  from  a  system  undergoing  repairs  is  not  required  in  most  cases. Reclamation is required if, for example, free water stands in the system due to a tube failure or because a motor burned out. Recovered refrigerants from the equipment must be reclaimed if  ownership  is  transferred  outside  of  the  Air  Force.  The  Air  Force  is  considered  a  single owner so reclamation is  not  necessary  given inter-base transfers.  If reclamation  is  required, the installation HAZMART will provide guidance on proper handling. A5.3.  Recovery  Equipment.  Appropriate  recovery  equipment  must  be  utilized  to  meet  the requirements of the inspection or maintenance task. Equipment must be certified and capable of meeting the levels of evacuation in Table A5.1. Table A5.1.  Required Levels of Evacuation for Appliances1. Type of Appliance Inches of Hg  Vacuum2 Equipment3 Manufactured Before 15 Nov 93 Equipment3 Manufactured After 15 Nov 93 Very high-pressure appliance High-pressure appliance or isolated component, normally containing 200 pounds refrigerant High-pressure appliance or isolated component, normally containing 200 pounds or more refrigerant Medium-pressure appliance or isolated component normally containing less than 200 pounds refrigerant Medium-pressure appliance or isolated component normally containing 200 pounds or more refrigerant 0 0 4 4 4 Low-pressure appliance 25 4 Notes:  1.

New  Equipment  Evaluation  Criteria.  If  the  equipment  cannot  reach  required evacuation levels or maintain purge-loss limits of less than 3 percent refrigerant/NCG for the total  amount  being  recycled,  it  should  be  replaced  with  new  equipment  and  the  following criteria should be evaluated to acquire the appropriate item. A5.3.1.1.  UL or AHRI certification. 48 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 A5.3.1.2.  Safety. Look for high-pressure, low-pressure, and high-temperature sensors for system safety shutdowns or lockouts. A5.3.1.3.  Job function versatility. A5.3.1.4.  Capacity of the container that holds the refrigerant during servicing. A5.3.1.5.  Recovery rate (one hour maximum). A5.3.1.6.  Fitting designed for low-loss. A5.3.1.7.  Tanks: proprietary or non-proprietary. A5.3.1.8.  Filter replacement prices. A5.4.  Inspection and Maintenance Concepts. A5.4.1.  Service Practices. A5.4.1.1.  Before  opening  a  system,  certified  technicians  should  clearly  understand  the type of service work required. Previous service records should be part of the work order package but can be obtained from the service records or operating logs. This information should  be  used  to  develop  a  work  plan  that  ensures  refrigerant  losses  are  minimal  and identifies areas to check for possible leaks. A5.4.1.2.  Proper  servicing  practices  require  that  refrigerants  be  isolated  from  the environment to the greatest extent possible. The following actions must happen at every servicing: A5.4.1.2.1.  Evacuate  the  unit  to  the  amounts  shown  in  Table  A5.1  to  either  the system’s integral receiver or recovery unit. A5.4.1.2.2.  Do  not  knowingly  vent  any  refrigerants  during  the  maintaining, servicing, repairing, or disposing of AC/R equipment. A5.4.1.2.3.  Upon completion of servicing and maintenance, return the unit to proper operating charge level. A5.4.1.3.  Because  low-pressure  systems  can  be  under  a  vacuum  when  they  are  not  in operation,  the  EPA  requires  those  systems  undergoing  minor  servicing,  such  as  oil changes, to be pressurized to atmospheric pressure. One of the following systems must be utilized to achieve proper pressure. A5.4.1.3.1.  Blanket Heater.  The most common pressurization system is an electric-resistant  blanket  heater  installed  between  the  evaporator’s  outer  shell  and  its insulation jacket. Because it is mounted on the underside of the shell, it is commonly known  as  a  belly  heater.  Typically,  temperature  or  pressure  sensors  monitor  the condenser  conditions  and  control  the  blanket  heater.  To  prevent  system  over-pressurization  and  refrigerant  loss,  temperature  and  pressure  sensors  should  be checked before energizing the blanket heater. A5.4.1.3.2.  Water  Heater/Pump.  This  system  type  uses  a  small  electric  water heater  and  circulating  pump  package.  It  heats  and  circulates  water  through  the evaporator  tubes  to  raise  the  refrigerant  temperature  and  system  pressure.  Before beginning  the  heating  process,  isolate  the  evaporator  from  the  distribution  piping AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 49 system.  The  heat  added  to  the  water  is  typically  controlled  by  monitoring  the  water temperature once it has left the evaporator. To prevent system over-pressurization and any  resulting  refrigerant  loss,  the  temperature  sensor  should  be  checked  before starting the water heater/pump system. A5.4.1.4.  Servicing Purge Systems. A5.4.1.4.1.  Most  purge  systems  require  regular  service:  purge  tanks  and  oil separators  must  be  cleaned;  gasket  materials  must  be  renewed;  purge  compressors must  be  overhauled.  Servicing  should  be  performed  according  to  the  purge  system manufacturer's  guidelines.  To  open  the  purge  system  for  service,  isolate  it  from  the chiller  refrigeration  system  and  recover  the  refrigerant  from  the  purge  unit.  To provide  a  convenient,  efficient  means  of  accomplishing  this  on  an  ongoing  basis, permanent  access  and  isolation  valves  should  be  installed  in  the  system  whenever  a new high-efficiency unit is introduced. A5.4.1.4.2.  Purge  runtime  should  be  monitored  and  recorded.  Many  manufacturers suggest  that  purge  systems  operating  in  excess  of  one  hour  of  runtime  per  week indicate excessive loss. A5.4.1.5.  Isolate equipment subcomponents for service and repair by installing isolation valves. Replace missing system connections and refrigerant cylinder caps. A5.4.1.6.  Oil  should not  be changed arbitrarily;  instead, oil samples should  be checked for  contamination  on  a  regular,  scheduled  basis.  If  contamination  is  present,  it  may indicate the need for oil and filter change. These tasks must be completed with minimal refrigerant  loss.  An  oil  sample  port  and  isolation  valves  should  be  installed  around  the filter when the unit is  first  serviced. Change oil filters at  intervals  more frequently than required  by  manufacturers'  recommendations  or  as  indicated  by  spectrographic  oil analyses. A5.4.1.7.  Refrigeration gauge sets should be rebuilt, if necessary, with new seals, valve seats, and packing to reduce refrigerant losses. Additional features that reduce refrigerant loss include: A5.4.1.7.1.  Quick-connect hose fittings. A5.4.1.7.2.  Four-valve  manifolds  to  reduce  hose  and  manifold  refrigerant  purging amounts. A5.4.1.7.3.  Quality, high-strength hoses to prevent ruptures. A5.4.1.7.4.  Separate  refrigeration  gauge  sets  for  each  refrigerant  that  will  prevent cross-contamination. A5.4.1.8.  A  vital  element  of  a  successful  preventive  maintenance  program  that minimizes emissions is a regularly scheduled chiller tube-testing program. It ensures tube integrity and efficiency and can provide early warnings. A5.4.2.  Inspection Practices and Techniques. A5.4.2.1.  Particulate  Evaluation.  The  oil  filter  is  an  important  source  of  information. Technicians  can  spot  debris  trapped  on  the  filter  material,  remove  it,  and  send  it  to  the spectrographic  oil  analysis  laboratory  to  identify  the  sediments  and  further  evaluate  the 50 AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 system’s  condition.  This  evaluation  can  be  just  as  important  as  testing  the  liquid  oil sample. When laboratory  analysis of chiller oil is required, select  a qualified laboratory that can perform a full range of tests. A5.4.2.1.1.  Dielectric strength measures a fluid’s insulating ability. A low value can indicate water or other conducting compounds. A5.4.2.1.2.  A  fluid's  color  can  indicate  contaminants  and  system  operating conditions. A5.4.2.1.3.  The  interfacial  tension  analysis  indicates  whether  compounds  with  a strong affinity for water are present. A5.4.2.2.  Spectrographic  Oil  Analysis.  Laboratory  analysis  of  chiller  oil  is  a  method of  analyzing  the  mechanical  condition  of  equipment  and  pinpoints  locations  when  tear-down  and  visual  inspections  are  required.  A  spectrographic  oil  analysis  is  inexpensive and typically has a quick turn-around time. Before obtaining an oil sample for analysis, a chiller must operate for at least one hour; otherwise, any metals in the oil will not have enough time to  be re-entrained from  the machine bottom  and will go undetected during analysis. With a complete and accurate laboratory oil analysis, testing system correction recommendations will become more reliable. A5.4.2.2.1.  Analysis  of  Metal  Content.  Chiller  oil  spectrographic  analysis  shows the oil’s metal content and should indicate the possible source of the metal. Elements typically discovered during analyses and available sources are listed in Table A5.2. A5.4.2.2.2.  Recording  Analysis  Results.  Oil analysis results should be included in the  maintenance  history.  In  many  cases,  rapid  changes  in  values  may  indicate  more problems  than  the  value’s  magnitude  at  any  given  point  in  time.  In  fact,  the  real strength of spectrographic analysis is the ability to spot excessive wear rates indicated by  rapidly  increasing  concentrations  of  the  elements  listed  in  Table  A5.2  relative  to the  number  of  operating  hours  between  samples.  To  properly  spot  these  trends,  the analytical laboratory performing the tests must have historical test data. A5.4.2.3.  Eddy  Current  Tube-Testing.  Eddy  current  tube  testing  measures  the thickness  of  the  tube  as  the  probe  passes  from  one  end  to  the  other.  This  method  can identify  potential  leak  areas  before  they  occur.  It  can  prevent  unscheduled  chiller downtime,  lost  production,  lost  cooling,  major  chiller  damage,  and  refrigerant  charge contamination. Refrigerant contaminated with water in-leakage requires reclamation. To protect  the  refrigerant  charge,  a  chiller  requires  eddy  current  tube-testing  at  least  once every three years.   AFMAN32-7089  4 NOVEMBER 2016 51 Table A5.2.  Elements and Sources.

Disposal of Unusable Fluids. A5.4.3.1.  Oil  Replacement.  When  oil  analysis  indicates  that  the  refrigerant  oil  should be replaced, use the appropriate recovery system to remove the refrigerant for reuse. The remainder  oil  may  or  may  not  require  disposal  as  a  hazardous  waste,  depending  on  its mixture  characteristics.  Coordinate  all  disposal  actions  with  the  guidance  of  the installation HAZMART. A5.4.3.2.  Refrigerant  Replacement.  Non-contaminated  refrigerant  remaining  on  the installation  can  be  returned  to  any  AC/R  equipment  on  the  installation  with  no  other action.  Any  contaminated  refrigerants  must  be  coordinated  through  the  installation HAZMART for proper recycling, reclamation, or disposal, as appropriate for the level of contamination. A5.5.  Documentation.  During and after service and inspections of equipment technicians must record all data required for the work order, including the amount of refrigerant serviced, amount reused, amount of refrigerant added, observations of the overall condition of system equipment, and potential leak areas. Ensure all refrigerant actions are properly documented and entered into APIMS. A5.6.  Additional  References.
