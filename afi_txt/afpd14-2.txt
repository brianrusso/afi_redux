Deptula)  Pages: 6Intelligence personnel must be trained and certified to support their assigned mission design series, weap-ons system or intelligence activity.  This directive provides the policy to ensure Air Force (Regular AF,Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserves) intelligence personnel can provide critical intelligence sup-port to enable successful mission completion.  Ensure that all records created as a result of processes pre-scribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123, Management of Recordsand disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/. Restrictions expressed in an instruction can be made more, but not less, restrictiveby supplement.  The provisions of higher-level publications take precedence over lower-level publica-tions.  This policy document supports all Air Force Intelligence Training Transformation (IT2) efforts asmandated by DoD and other national policy directives.1.  General:1.1.  The Air Force will establish policy to ensure intelligence personnel meet the full range of intelli-gence requirements to initiate and sustain global air, space, and cyberspace operations.  Adherence toprescribed guidance and procedures is mandatory for all intelligence personnel.  2.  Responsibilities:2.1.  The Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AF/A2),establishes guidance and procedures, interprets policy and provides oversight for intelligence rulesand procedures.2.2.  AF/A2 Staff will be the OPR for AFI 14-202.  AFI 14-202 will become a three-volume AFI andbe renamed.  AF/A2F will be the OPR for all three volumes.  They are: AFI 14-202, Volume 1, Intel-ligence Training; Volume 2, Intelligence Standardization/Evaluation Program; and Volume 3, GeneralIntelligence Rules.2.3.  The MAJCOM OPR for each MDS, weapons system, or intelligence function or activity will alsobe designated the lead MAJCOM for said system, unit or activity.2AFPD14-2   29 NOVEMBER 20072.3.1.  AF/A2 is the approval authority for the AFI 14-202 series as well as the MDS, weaponssystem, or intelligence function or activity-specific AFIs.  Per AFI 33-360 AFIâ€™s authored in thefield must be certified and approved at AF/A2.2.4.  The lead Major Command (MAJCOM) or Field Operating Agency (FOA) will establish andmanage guidance and instructions for training, standardization and evaluation (stan/eval), and intelli-gence operations procedures for intelligence personnel.  The lead MAJCOM/FOA will coordinatewith users to establish the guidance for intelligence training, stan/eval and operations support for allmission design series (MDS), weapons systems and other intelligence functions and activities.  LeadMAJCOMs/FOAs need to be sensitive to the widely varying missions when developing and coordi-nating publications for each MDS, weapons system, or intelligence function and activity.  All MAJ-COMs, FOAs, direct reporting units (DRUs) and primary support units (PSUs) will comply.  LeadMAJCOMs/FOAs for each new AFI 14-2 are as follows:2.4.1.  ACC2.4.1.1.  AFI 14-2A/OA-10  2.4.1.2.

The new standardized AFI 14-2 set includes one basic document with three volumes (AFI14-202, Vols 1, 2, and 3) and a three volume set of MDS, weapons system, or intelligence function oractivity-specific AFIs.  The basic AFIs are of higher precedence than the MDS, weapons system, orintelligence function or activity-specific AFIs.3.2.  The 14-202 series AFIs provide guidance to the MDS, weapons system, or intelligence, functionor activity-specific AFIs.  The basic AFIs are structured as follows:3.2.1.  AFI 14-202, Volume 1, Intelligence Training.  This is the basic intelligence training pro-gram, which mandates a standardized intelligence-training program for each MDS, weapons sys-tem, or intelligence function or activity.3.2.2.  AFI 14-202, Volume 2, Intelligence Standardization/Evaluation Program.  This instructionestablishes the Intelligence Standardization and Evaluation Program (Stan/Eval) that supports AirForce objectives.  This instruction will provide guidance on how to structure and monitor theIntelligence Stan/Eval program.  It mandates a standardized Intelligence Stan/Eval program foreach MDS, weapons system, or intelligence function or activity.  3.2.3.  AFI 14-202, Volume 3, General Intelligence Rules.  This instruction prescribes generalintelligence procedures and policies that govern how intelligence personnel operate or supportMDSs, weapons systems, and other functions and activities.3.3.  Lead MAJCOMs will author and coordinate MDS and weapons system-specific AFIs.  MAJ-COMs will author and coordinate intelligence function or activity-specific AFIs as required.  Imple-menting directives will use MDS, weapons system, or intelligence function or activity-specificnumbering.  For example, F-16 publications will be labeled:3.3.1.  AFI 14-2F16, Volume 1, F-16 Unit Intelligence Training.  Institutes the F-16 MDS-specificintelligence training program, to include initial qualification training, mission qualification train-4AFPD14-2   29 NOVEMBER 2007ing, specialized training and continuation training.  This instruction will employ basic guidanceprovided in AFI 14-202, Volume 1.3.3.2.  AFI 14-2F16, Volume 2, F-16 Unit Intelligence Evaluation Criteria.  Establishes F-16MDS-specific intelligence standardization and evaluation criteria.  This instruction utilizes AFI14-202, Volume 2, as the template to implement and monitor the program.3.3.3.  AFI 14-2F16, Volume 3, F-16 Unit Intelligence Procedures.  Establishes F-16 MDS-spe-cific intelligence rules and procedures for intelligence and intelligence support activities.  Thisinstruction utilizes AFI 14-202, Volume 3 as the foundation for establishing mission and airframespecific intelligence rules.4.  Publications Supplements:4.1.  MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and PSUs may supplement the basic AFIs.  These supplements willnot be less restrictive than the lead-AFI.  Forward proposed supplements to the appropriate Air StaffOPR for approval.4.1.1.  Limit MDS, weapons system, or intelligence function or activity-specific supplements tounique requirements only.4.1.2.  In order to promote maximum interoperability and standardization procedures, use only thebasic MDS, weapons system, or intelligence function or activity-specific AFIs for planning oroperations involving composite forces from lead and user commands.5.  Waivers:  AF/A2 will authorize waivers to this directive for an essential requirement.  Send MAJ-COM-coordinated waiver requests by message to HQ USAF WASHINGTON DC//A2//.6.  Publications Development and Coordination:  New publications, changes, or revisions will conform toAFI 33-360, Air Force Content Management Program-Publications, and the timeline in Attachment 1.7.  Publications Interface:  See Attachment 2 for publications that interface with this policy.MICHAEL W.

If unable to resolve at MAJCOM level, forward the issues to AF/A2F for ultimate conflict resolution by the AF CFM.  A final draft is then published.4 Edit--MAJCOM OPR develops the final package and submits it to AF/A2F for coordination and approval.  The MAJCOM OPR forwards the final AFI to user commands to begin writing appropriate supplements, as required.5 Air Staff Coordination--AF/A2F will coordinate with appropriate offices designated in AFI 33-360.  The 45 day period is established for one full edit cycle to input the proposed changes at the Air Staff level. 6 Publishing--Due to the required submission dates and distribution to the field, the 30 days will cover any CD-ROM cycle as well as paper publication and distribution to the end user.
