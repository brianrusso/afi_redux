Objective.  This  manual  describes  procedures  essential  for  successful  operation  of  the USAF Personnel Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry Program (hereafter referred to as the Dosimetry Program),  particularly  at  base  level.    It  documents  the  implementation  of  external  and  internal radiation  monitoring  policies  established  in  Title  10,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations,  Part  20  (10 CFR  20)  and  AFI  48-148,  Ionizing  Radiation  Protection.    In  addition,  this  manual  provides information  to  assist  the  Installation  Radiation  Safety  Officer  (IRSO)  and  Thermoluminescent Dosimetry (TLD) Program Monitor in managing their dosimetry program. 1.2.  Purpose.  This manual establishes the requirements and procedures for organizations using the Dosimetry Program to monitor personnel occupational exposures to ionizing radiation.  This manual also establishes the basic procedures for personnel who have occupational exposures to radiation. Examples of occupational exposures include exposures that occur during the operation of  x-ray  equipment  or  during  response  to  a  radiological  or  nuclear  accident  or  incident. Occupational exposures do not include exposures resulting from naturally occurring background radiation  (whether  cosmic  or  terrestrial  sources)  or  exposures  received  as  a  patient  undergoing medical diagnosis or treatment. The Dosimetry Program is designed to monitor, when necessary, occupational  radiation  exposures.    All  Dosimetry  Program  monitoring  results  are  maintained permanently in the USAF Master Radiation Exposure Registry (MRER), which is maintained by the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, Analytical Services Division (USAFSAM/OEA). 1.3.  Program Eligibility.  Personnel eligible to participate in this program include: 1.3.1.  Military  and  civilian  Air  Force,  Air  Force  Reserves  and  Air  National  Guard occupational  radiation  workers  who  require  personnel  radiation  dosimetry  monitoring  as identified  by  the  IRSO.  Air  Force  dosimetry  services  may  be  provided  to  contractor personnel  if  the  contract  states  these  and  other  occupational  medicine  services  will  be provided. 1.3.2.  Military and civilian occupational  radiation  workers of other Department  of Defense (DOD)  agencies.    Under  terms  of  agreements  between  USAFSAM/OEA  and  the  Radiation Dosimetry  Centers  of  DOD  sister  services  or  agencies,  all  personnel  monitoring  results  for individuals  in  this  category  will  be  stored  in  the  USAF  MRER  and  may  be  reported  to  the responsible Service or Agency dosimetry center. 1.3.3.  Occupational  radiation  workers  employed  by  federal,  state,  or  local  government agencies  outside  DOD.    These  individuals  may  receive  personnel  monitoring  from USAFSAM/OEA  on  a  fee-for-services  basis  under terms  of  agreements  between USAFSAM/OEA and their agency radiation safety office. 1.4.  Overview of Routine Operations. 1.4.1.  General.  The Dosimetry Program is operated at the base level by the IRSO (usually a Bioenvironmental  Engineer  (BE),  a  Senior  BE  Noncommissioned  Officer,  or  a  qualified civilian  employee)  and  a  designated  TLD  Program  Monitor,  usually  a  BE  Technician,  (Air Force Specialty Code [AFSC] 4BOX1) or qualified civilian employee. The  IRSO identifies personnel  to  be  monitored,  determines  how  many  administrative  areas  are  needed  to  cover 8 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 the entire base, assigns a letter or number to designate those areas, determines the monitoring frequency  (monthly,  quarterly,  or  semi-annually),  and  provides  this  information  to USAFSAM/OEA.    Each  installation  is  assigned  a  unique  base  code  that  is  used  to  identify the  base  in  all  Dosimetry  Program  records.    USAFSAM/OEA  registers  individuals  into  the program according to their base code.  USAFSAM/OEA separates each base dosimeter issue into the designated monitoring areas and issues TLDs and extremity dosimeters for either a monthly, quarterly, or semi-annual monitoring period as specified by the IRSO.  At the end of the monitoring period, the TLD Monitor retrieves issued dosimeters and issues a new set of  dosimeters  to  the  monitored  individuals.    The  TLDs  are  removed  from  the  whole  body, collar, and neutron hangers and are placed into the shipping tray (if one was supplied). The TLDs  and  extremity  dosimeters  are  packaged  and  returned  to  USAFSAM/OEA  for processing.  Dose equivalent reports are forwarded to  the  IRSO for review, to confirm  that the values reported are appropriate for the individual and the monitoring period and for use in managing  the  installation-level  radiation  safety  program.    This  cycle  is  repeated  until  the IRSO  removes  the  individuals  from  the  program,  cancels  monitoring  for  that  area,  or  the individual  leaves  the  work  area  through  a  permanent  change  of  station,  separation,  or retirement. 1.4.2.  Who  is  Monitored.    Detailed  guidance  for  individuals  requiring  monitoring  is contained  in  AFI  48-148.    In  general,  monitoring  is  required  for  certain  radiation  workers based  on  job  description  and  their  potential  for  and  for  anyone  who  is  likely  to  exceed  an external dose of 100 mrem or 2% of the annual limits of intake (ALI).  Individuals who work with  unsealed  radioactive  sources  and  are  at  risk  of  obtaining  an  internal  exposure  greater than  2%  of  the  ALI  will  be  also  included  in  a  bioassay  program  (see  paragraph  4.7).  Pregnant  radiation  workers  are  to  be  monitored  throughout  their  gestation  period.    It  is important  to  remember  that  the  decision  to  enroll  individuals  in  the  monitoring  program  is made by the IRSO. 1.4.3.  Area Control Dosimeters.  USAFSAM/OEA provides area control dosimeters for each radiation  exposure  area  and  dosimeter  type  worn  in  that  area.    Area  control  dosimeters  are used  to  measure  background  radiation  accumulated  during  transit  or  storage  of  dosimeters and are handled in the same manner as the dosimeters issued to individuals.  To provide an accurate  measurement  of  an  individual's  occupational  dose,  the  dose  assessed  using  a  five-year average daily background of control dosimeters is subtracted from the dose recorded on the  issued  dosimeter.    Use  of  a  five-year  average  daily  background  ensures  accurate background  subtraction  for  late  returned  badges.    An  area  control  dosimeter  shall  never  be used  for  monitoring  an  individual.    The  area  control  dosimeter  is  always  maintained  in  the TLD storage rack or designated TLD storage area used for issued dosimeters when they are not being worn.  Area control dosimeters must be returned to USAFSAM/OEA at the end of the monitoring period along with the dosimeters issued during the monitoring period.  Each area must have a control dosimeter for each dosimeter type (e.g., one whole body dosimeter, one neutron dosimeter, one extremity dosimeter). 1.4.4.  Storage  of  TLDs.    Any  dosimeter,  when  not  being  worn,  must  be  stored  with  its associated control dosimeter on a dosimeter storage  rack or in  a storage area designated by the IRSO.  The storage area must be as free from radiation sources as possible and away from excessive  heat  or  moisture.    Dosimeters  are  to  be  used  only  in  the  designated  work  area.  They  are  not  to  be  stored  in/on  an  individual's  desk  or  placed  onto  the  dashboard  of  a AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 9 vehicle.  Proper control and storage of dosimeters is important to ensure the dosimeters are not tampered with, can be returned for processing, and can provide a dose representative of the  working  environment.    Improper  storage  adversely  affects  the  accuracy  of  dose assessment and may result in a need for an exposure investigation by the IRSO. 1.4.5.  Extra  (Spare)  Dosimeters.    USAFSAM/OEA  provides  extra  (spare)  dosimeters  with each  routine  shipment.    When  a  new  person  is  identified  as  requiring  monitoring,  the individual  needs  to  be  added  to  the  Dosimetry  Program.    Instead  of  waiting  for  a  TLD  or extremity  dosimeter  to  be  issued  from  USAFSAM/OEA,  extra  dosimeters  can  be  used  to allow  the  individual  to  immediately  start  working.    When  using  extra  dosimeters,  the Dosimetry  Assignment  Data  Form  (RDL  Listing  1523)  must  be  properly  annotated  to provide  all  necessary  information  for  USAFSAM/OEA  to  register  the  individual  in  the Dosimetry Program.  All  extra dosimeters, whether issued or not, are  to be returned to USAFSAM/OEA at the end of the monitoring period. There is no preprinted wear location on RDL Listing 1523 for extra dosimeters.  The wear location must be designated when the dosimeter is issued.  Customers may request an increase in their quarterly issue to maintain enough  extra  TLDs  for  emergency  response  operations.    TLDs  that  are  requested  for  this purpose must be handled in a manner consistent with all personnel TLDs.  Should the spare TLD be issued to personnel for emergency response, that information should be annotated on the RDL Listing 1523. 1.4.6.  Returning Dosimeters for Processing 1.4.6.1.  Routine  dosimeter  shipments  shall  be  postmarked  for  shipment  by  the  10th calendar  day  following  the  end  of  the  monitoring  period.  (T-2)  All  shipments  shall  be accompanied by the “Returning Dosimeters Checklist”, Attachment 4. (T-2) 1.4.6.2.  Exchange  dosimeters  from  previous  monitoring  period  for  dosimeters  from  the current  monitoring  period  to  include  Area  Control,  Personnel,  and  Spare  TLDs.    Check all  dosimeters  to  be  shipped  against  the  current  version  of  the  Radiation  Dosimetry Laboratory Electronic (RDL) Listing 1523 and ensure that all "Not Returned" dosimeters are  indicated  on  the  RDL  Listing  1523  by  typing  NR,  TDY,  or  Lost,  in  the  Comment Field.    Dosimeters  used  in  Special  Surveys  must  be  designated  as  such  on  the  RDL Listing 1523 and the physical location identified in the Comment Field. (T-2) The RDL Listing 1523 must be reviewed by IRSO or Alternate IRSO and all changes to the RDL Listing  1523  must  be  submitted  and  reviewed  by  the  RDL  prior  to  shipping  the dosimeters.  (T-2)  Discard  all  labels  in  a  manner  designed  to  ensure  that  privacy  act information  is  handled  properly.    Exception:  Late  Return  dosimeters  should  be accompanied  with  the  original  dosimeter  labels  supplied  by  the  RDL  to  facilitate tracking upon receipt. 1.4.6.3.  Dosimeters must be screened with radiation monitoring instrumentation (capable of  alpha  and  beta  measurements)  to  ensure  no  exterior  contamination  is  present  before shipping. (T-2) Please refer to the “Addendum to the Bioenvironmental Engineer’s Guide to Ionizing Radiation: Appendix F Installation-Level Internal Dosimetry Program”. 1.4.6.4.  Dosimeters must be separated by monitoring periods and clearly identified. (T-2) Dosimeters  designated  for  Special  Surveys  may  be  returned  with  the  routine  shipment; however, they must be placed in separate sealable plastic bags, e.g. Ziploc®, and clearly identified. (T-2) 10 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 1.4.6.5.  Place all extremity dosimeters in sealable plastic bags. (T-2) 1.4.6.6.  If a Panasonic  TL dosimeter tray is  provided by the RDL, the dosimeters must be placed into shipping tray appropriately: upright, secured with rubber bands, and placed in  plastic  sleeves  (if  provided  by  the  RDL)  and  returned.  (T-2)  If  a  Panasonic  TL dosimeter  tray  is  NOT  provided  by  the  RDL:    all  dosimeters  must  be  separated  by monitoring  periods,  placed  into  sealable  plastic  bags,  and  the  monitor  period  clearly identified on the bag. (T-2) 1.4.6.7.  If  the  dosimeters  were  received  in  a  single,  double  or  triple  tray  type  box,  the original shipping box (single, double, or triple) must be used to return the dosimeters. (T-2) If the RDL DID NOT ship your TLDs in a single, double, or triple tray type box, an appropriate shipping container must be used to ensure they are protected and returned in an orderly manner. (T-2) Note: Letter style (paper) envelopes are NOT acceptable.  The contents  of  the  package  must  be  secured  by  adding  bubble  wrap  (as  required)  and  the shipping  container  properly  sealed.  (T-2)  Note:  Bubble  wrap  is  the  only  approved packing material.  A "CAUTION" label provided by the RDL should be attached to the shipping  container  next  to  the  address  label  and  on  the  reverse  side  of  the  container.  Note: The RDL will provide additional “Caution” labels at the request of the customer. (T-2) 1.4.6.8.  The package must be shipped by the most expeditious and traceable means, e.g., FedEx, Certified Mail, UPS, or DHL and addressed to:  (see Figure 1.1)  (T-2) Figure 1.1.  Address. USAF Radiation Dosimetry Laboratory 2510 Fifth St, Area B Building 0840 Room W 329 Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7913 Note: Dosimeters should not be shipped on Friday nor should they be marked for Saturday or other after-duty hours delivery. 1.4.7.  Returning Electronic Personal Dosimeters (EPDs) for Calibration 1.4.7.1.  Remove  all  batteries  from  the  EPDs  prior  to  packaging  and  dispose  of  them properly in accordance with your installations established protocols. (T-2) 1.4.7.2.  All EPD shipments shall be packaged to ensure that the devices are not damaged during  transportation.  (T-2)  The  contents  of  the  package  must  be  secured  by  adding bubble wrap (as required) and the shipping container properly sealed. (T-2) 1.4.7.3.  A memorandum for record must be included with each shipment providing, as a minimum, the following information: (T-2) 1.4.7.3.1.  Total number of EPDs within the package.  1.4.7.3.2.  Serial Number of each EPD contained within the package. 1.4.7.3.3.  The Installation/Unit having ownership of the EPDs. 1.4.7.3.4.  How each EPD is used by the Installation/Unit (e.g., Readiness, NDI, etc.). AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 11 1.4.7.3.5.  The  physical  mailing  address  for  the  return  of  the  EPDs  post-calibration.  Note:    The  RDL  uses  FedEx  for  return  shipments  whenever  possible.

Packages  sent  to  USAFSAM/OEA  should  be  shipped  by  the  most  expeditious and traceable means to the address listed in section 1.4.6.8. 1.5.  Additional Guidance. 1.5.1.  Investigation  Action  Levels  (IALs).    To  ensure  doses  are  maintained  As  Low  As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA), IALs defined by the IRSO should not be lower than the analytical  system's  lower  limit  of  detection  (LLD).    USAFSAM/OEA  has  determined  the appropriate  LLD  for  dosimeters  issued  to  field  operations  to  be  0.1  mSv  [10  millirem (mrem)]. External radiation doses less than the LLD are assigned as zero in the MRER.  The IAL, or the dose equivalent value or radionuclide intake activity, should be set by the IRSO.  These levels require further investigation when exceeded.  IALs are normally tailored to each using  section’s  historical  dosimetry  data  in  order  to  promptly  identify  and  correct  adverse trends. 1.5.2.  Special  Studies.    Installations  often  use  TLDs  to  conduct  area  surveys  and  for  other special  studies  not  directly  measuring  the  radiation  dose  to  uniquely  identified  individuals (see  paragraphs  7.4  and  7.5).    USAFSAM/OEA  will  supply  appropriate  dosimeters  and associated  controls  as  required  to  support  special  studies.    Note:    Issued  whole  body dosimeters are not to be used for this purpose. 1.5.3.  Dosimetry for Visitors.  Visitors entering high radiation  areas [0.1 rem  (1 mSv) in 1 hour  at  30  cm  from  the  radiation  source  or  at  30  cm  from  any  surface  that  the  radiation penetrates] and very high radiation areas [500 rads (5 Gy) in 1 hour at 1 m from a radiation source or at 1 m from any surface that the radiation penetrates] are required to be monitored.  Visitors  who  may  receive  a  dose  exceeding  10%  of  public  dose  limits  should  be  afforded monitoring  (see  paragraph  7.3).    This  can  be  accomplished  by  issuing  TLDs  or  Electronic Personnel Dosimeters (EPDs).  The extra TLDs, provided with each TLD shipment may be issued  for  monitoring  visitors  entering  radiation  areas.    All  TLDs  issued  for  this  purpose should be annotated on the RDL Listing 1523 to include the required personnel information.  Visitors who are issued TLDs or have a non-zero dose measured on a self-reading dosimeter must  be  registered  in  the  Dosimetry  Program  for  the  monitoring  period  in  which  the  visit occurred.  If a visitor's dose is measured with a self-reading dosimeter, the local IRSO is to be notified and any non-zero dose results must be forwarded to USAFSAM/OEA in writing by  the  IRSO  for  inclusion  in  the  MRER.    Only  self-reading  dosimeters  having  a  current calibration  in  accordance  with  Precision  Measurement  Equipment  Laboratory  (PMEL) requirements may be used for this purpose. 1.6.  Non-routine  Operations  (Emergency,  Contingency  &  Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction [WMD] Response Actions). 1.6.1.  In general, the processes and procedures in this manual will be used for all radiation related deployments or emergencies. 1.6.2.  Electronic Personnel Dosimeters (EPD) are incorporated in installation response plans and use of these devices is outlined in paragraph 3.3. 12 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Air  Force  Whole  Body  and  Collar  Dosimeters.  Please  refer  to  Attachment  3  for additional  technical  and  operational  details.    All  AF  personnel  must  wear  USAFSAM/OEA approved  and  calibrated  dosimeters.    Dosimeters  other  than  the  models  listed  in  this AFMAN must be approved by USAFSAM. 3.1.1.  Panasonic  UD-802  Whole  Body  Dosimeter  and  820  Hanger  Combination  –  “Smoke Holder”  (General  Purpose  Dosimeter).    This  general-purpose  dosimeter  is  used  to  measure radiation exposures to the whole body.  The dosimeter is sensitive to beta, gamma, x-ray, and neutron  radiation.    It  must  be  worn  by  all  personnel  enrolled  in  the  Dosimetry  Program regardless of other type(s) of dosimeters worn.  Exceptions to this wear policy exist, but need to  be  coordinated  through  USAFSAM/OEA.  If  specialty  dosimeters  such  as  the  collar  or extremity dosimeters are not worn, the whole body dosimeter will also be used to determine dose equivalents for the head, lens of the eye, and extremities.  This dosimeter is clipped on outer clothing in the front part of the body below the neck and above the waist.  When worn with a collar dosimeter, the whole body dosimeter is always worn underneath any lead apron.    When  worn  without  a  collar  dosimeter  and  a  lead  apron  is  worn,  the  whole body  dosimeter  is  worn  on  the  individual’s  collar,  outside  any  protective  shielding.  When  a  whole  body  dosimeter  is  not  being  worn,  it  is  stored  with  the  area  control dosimeter.  RDL Listing 1523 designates this wear location as "BODY." Figure 3.1.  Typical UD-802 Whole Body Dosimeter in Smoke (Clear) Hanger.  3.1.2.  Panasonic UD-802 Collar Dosimeter.  A collar dosimeter is the primary device used to evaluate  exposures  to  the  head  and  lens  of  the  eye  and,  when  applicable,  to  facilitate calculating  the  effective  dose  equivalent  under  the  special  monitoring  circumstances described  in  Chapter  4.    Consideration  for  wearing  this  dosimeter  should  be  given  to individuals engaged in fluoroscopic examinations, in the operation of portable medical x-ray equipment,  in  performing  cardiac  catheterizations,  or  who  otherwise  may  wear  protective lead aprons and for whom the whole body dosimeter may not provide an accurate assessment of dose to the head, neck, or lens of the eye.  The collar dosimeter is always worn outside any  shielded  protective  covering.  The  collar dosimeter may be placed  in  a red hanger to facilitate  verification  of  proper  placement  while  worn  in  conjunction  with  a  whole  body dosimeter; however, if the collar dosimeter is the only dosimeter used then it shall be placed in the standard smoke hanger.  A collar dosimeter should be worn as near to the thyroid as possible to determine the unshielded exposure to the head and lens of the eye.  When a collar dosimeter is not being worn, it is stored with the area control dosimeters.  RDL Listing 1523 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 19 designates  this  wear  location  as  "COLL."    The  IRSO  should  contact  USAFSAM/OEA  for guidance in other circumstances such as a desire to provide collar dosimetry service. 3.1.3.  Panasonic  UD-802  Whole  Body  Dosimeter/811  Hanger  Combination  -  “Amber Hanger”  (Neutron  Dosimeter).    This  dosimeter/hanger  configuration  is  a  specialized  design that  provides  enhanced  capability  to  measure  doses  due  to  exposure  to  neutrons.    This  is accomplished by the incorporation of a cadmium filter into the hanger.  The cadmium filter improves  the  dosimeter’s  response  to  the  wide  range  of  neutron  energies  that  may  be operationally  encountered.    A  neutron  dosimeter  is  the  primary  device  for  determining  the neutron dose equivalents to the whole body.  The neutron dosimeter is never worn without a  whole  body  badge.    Since  the  neutron  dosimeter  is  an  albedo  device  (i.e.,  it  uses  the scattered  neutrons  from  the  user's  body  to  determine  the  dose  equivalent),  it  must  be  worn flat against the body, at the midsection of the individual, with the back of the dosimeter next to  the  body.  Note:  The  back  of  the  dosimeter  is  clearly  indicated  by  the  presence  of  a pre-printed  identification  label.  When a neutron dosimeter is not being worn, it is stored with  the  area  control  dosimeters.    RDL  Listing  1523  designates  this  wear  location  as "NBOD." Figure 3.2.  Typical UD-802 Dosimeter in Amber Hanger.  3.2.  Air  Force  Extremity  Dosimeters.  Please  refer  to  Attachment  3  for  additional  technical and  operational  details.  All  AF  personnel  must  wear  USAFSAM/OEA  approved  and calibrated  dosimeters.    Dosimeters  other  than  the  models  listed  in  this  AFMAN  must  be approved by USAFSAM. 3.2.1.  General  Description.    USAFSAM/OEA  has  characterized  one  extremity  (ring) dosimetry  system  – the  “EXT-RAD”,  developed  by  Thermo  Electron  Radiation Measurement  and  Protection.        The  EXT-RAD  system  is  an  active  phosphor  chipstrate assembled into sealed pouches and worn in band-aid style rings.  The EXT-RAD dosimeter is able to be cold sterilized.  It is bar-coded, has human-readable identity and is reusable.  The extremity dosimeter is the primary device to evaluate exposures to the hand and forearm of an individual.  The extremity dosimeter is never worn without a whole body dosimeter.  The ring should be worn on the finger that will receive the highest dose of radiation from the source and must be oriented so that the circular indentation is facing the radiation source.  If the  extremity  dosimeter  is  worn  with  leaded  gloves,  it  is  worn  under  the  shielded  gloves.  When an extremity dosimeter is not being worn, it is stored with the area control dosimeters.  RDL Listing 1523 designates this wear location as "RING". 3.2.2.  Extremity  Dosimeter  Response  at  Nonstandard  Beta  Energies.    The  dose  calculation algorithms  for  the  single  element  extremity  dosimeter  (EXT-RAD)  do  not  automatically compensate for exposures to beta radiation at energies other than those used to characterize 20 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 the  dosimeter  (i.e.,  0.556  MeV  90Sr/90Y  and  0.267  MeV  204Tl).    Note:  Because  of  this inherent  limitation  in  dosimeter  design,  it  is  important  that  the  customer  advise USAFSAM/OEA of the type and energy of beta radiation for which the dosimeter is to be evaluated so that appropriate correction factors can be applied. Figure 3.3.  EXT-RAD "band-aid" Chipstrate Extremity Dosimeter. Figure 3.4.  EXT-RAD Extremity Dosimeter in Use.   3.3.  Air  Force  Electronic  Personnel  Dosimeters  (EPDs).  All  AF  personnel  must  wear USAFSAM/OEA  approved  and  calibrated  dosimeters.    Dosimeters  other  than  the  models listed  in  this  AFMAN  must  be  approved  by  USAFSAM.    The  use  of  these  dosimeters  is reserved for special circumstances such as emergency response and selected Occupation Codes.  Contact  USAFSAM/OEA  for  further  guidance  prior  to  issue  or  use  of  this  technology.    Note: Currently USAFSAM/OEA is  recommending these units as  supplemental dosimetry to be used in conjunction with the TLD system. 3.3.1.  When the Thermo Electron Mark 2 and N2 are used to assess dose to personnel those dose  records  must  be  provided  to  USAFSAM/OEA  by  the  IRSO  using  the  EPD  Dose Processing Worksheet for inclusion in the MRER. (T-2) USAFSAM/OEA can issue EPDs to individual  personnel  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  please  contact  them  for  guidance/more information. 3.3.2.  USAFSAM/OEA  will  conduct  all  calibrations  of  Thermo  Electron  Mark  2  and  N2 EPD technology in use within the AF. AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 21 3.3.2.1.  EPDs  used  for  First  Responder  Teams  or  other  emergency  responders  as outlined in AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Plans and Programs, require calibration on an annual basis 3.3.2.2.  EPDs used for personnel monitoring on a regular basis will require a six-month calibration cycle. 3.3.3.  Thermo  Electron’s  Electronic  Personal  Dosimeter  –  Mk2.    The  EPD  Mk2  is  an electronic dosimeter that detects, measures, and records beta and gamma radiation.  The EPD Mk2 detects radiation and processes it to give an indication of deep dose, shallow dose, and the dose rate.  This information is displayed to the user via an LCD display on the top of the EPD.  The EPD also has various dose and dose-rate alarms that can be set to alert the wearer of a potential radiological hazard.  Mk2 EPDs are preset by USAFSAM/OEA and should not be  adjusted  by  the  end  user.    If  custom  alarm  set-points  are  required,  please  contact USAFSAM/OEA to create a profile for your installation. 3.3.4.  Thermo Electron’s Electronic Personnel Dosimeter – EPD N2.  The EPD N2 works in the same way as the EPD Mk2, except it detects neutron and photon radiation instead of beta and photon radiation. 3.3.4.1.  N2  EPDs  are  currently  used  for  WMD  First  Responders  exclusively.    These EPDs are preset by USAFSAM/OEA and should not be adjusted by the end user. 3.4.  EPD Support for Contingency Operations. 3.4.1.  Definitions 3.4.1.1.  Installation  Radiological  Response  Operation  –  Any  incident  or  accident  that poses  a  radiological  threat  to  military  personnel,  ranging  from  exposure  to  depleted uranium (DU) munitions, to the hazards posed by a potential terrorist use of improvised nuclear  devices  (INDs),  radiological  dispersion  devices  (RDDs),  or  an  accident  or incident in the nuclear stockpile.  Additionally, historical commercial nuclear power plant incidents  indicate  that  accidents  and/or  malevolent  use  of  radioactive  material  from civilian sources is possible and may have direct impact on AF installations. 3.4.1.2.  Contingency  EPDs  –  A  stockpile  of  EPDs  maintained  by  the  AF  Personnel Ionizing  Radiation  Dosimetry  Program  that  can  potentially  be  assigned  and  shipped  to AF installations requiring surge support during a Radiological Response Operation. 3.4.2.  Procedure 3.4.2.1.  The  IRSO  will  determine  the  number  of  personnel  that  must  be  monitored utilizing EPDs during the Radiological Response Operation, as defined in 3.4.1.1 above, 3.4.2.2.  The  IRSO  must  make  a  determination  that  personnel  monitoring  cannot  be accomplished with the EPD inventory currently available on the installation.  3.4.2.3.  The IRSO will determine the minimum number of EPDs required to augment the available  inventory  based  on  the  number  of  personnel  to  be  monitored,  the  monitoring period/frequency, and currently available EPD inventory. 3.4.2.4.  The IRSO will submit, with a courtesy copy to their respective MAJCOM BE, a written request to the ESOH Service Center including the analysis as described in  3.4.2.1 –  3.4.2.3 above. 22 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 3.4.2.5.  The ESOH Service Center will relay the request to the AF Radiation Dosimetry Program Director (RDPD) or the Dosimetry Laboratory Technical Director (DLTD). 3.4.2.6.  The  RDPD  and  DLTD  will  process  the  request  IAW  established  Operating Instructions. 3.4.2.7.  The AF Personnel Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry Program will make every effort to process all requests within 24 hours of notification. 3.4.2.8.  The AF Personnel  Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry Program will, when available, provide a means for the return shipment of the devices once the operation is complete. 3.5.  EPD Use for Dose of Record. 3.5.1.  General. EPDs read for dose at the installation level may be included within the USAF Master  Radiation  Exposure  Registry  (MRER)  and  be  covered  by  the  USAF  National Voluntary  Laboratory  Accreditation  Program  (NVLAP)  Ionizing  Radiation  Dosimetry Program. 3.5.2.  Procedure.  In order for the EPD dose to be included within the MRER and covered by the USAF Radiation Dosimetry Program’s NVLAP Accreditation the following criteria must be met 3.5.2.1.  The  EPD  must  have  a  valid  calibration  conducted  by  the  USAF  Radiation Dosimetry Laboratory. 3.5.2.2.  The  EPD  must  be  “read”  and  “zeroed”  prior  to  being  issued  to  another individual. 3.5.2.3.  The installation radiation safety officer or designee must complete and sign the Electronic Personal Dosimeter Dose Processing Worksheet (EPDDPW) and submit same to  the  AF  Personnel  Ionizing  Radiation  Dosimetry  Program.    Please  note:  This  form  is not  meant  to  replace  the  procedure  established  for  Assigned  Doses.    If  an  Installation RSO wishes to assign a dose to monitored personnel utilizing dose information from an EPD those may still be submitted through the radiation Dosimetry Web Application. 3.5.2.4.  The  EPDDPW  is  an  interactive  Adobe  Acrobat  form  that  allows  the  RSO  or designee to complete and digitally sign the document from any AF NIRPNET terminal.  The  customer  will  click  on  each  field  and  provide  the  required  information.    All  fields outlined in  red are mandatory.  An RSO signature is  required on each form.   Failure to provide  signed  forms  to  the  USAF  Dosimetry  Laboratory  will  prevent/delay  processing of the doses into the MRER.  The EPDDPW can be found in Attachment 6. AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 23 Chapter 4 CONDUCTING AN INSTALLATION-LEVEL DOSIMETRY PROGRAM 4.1.  General.  Detailed  guidance  on  managing  installation-level  Dosimetry  Programs  is contained in this chapter. 4.2.  Monitoring  Criteria.  Eligible  persons  (see  paragraph  1.3)  shall  be  entered  into  the Dosimetry Program based on the requirements of AFI 48-148. 4.2.1.  Personnel  monitoring  may  be  provided  to  individuals  not  meeting  any  of  the  above criteria if the IRSO determines that any of the following applies: 4.2.1.1.  The type of radiation to which the individual could be exposed is detectable by personnel monitoring equipment. 4.2.1.2.  Provision of monitoring services would be helpful in demonstrating compliance with ALARA. 4.2.1.3.  Monitoring  is  desirable  to  evaluate  potential  exposure  conditions  to  allay concern. 4.3.  Monitoring Period. 4.3.1.  General.    Most  personnel  enrolled  in  the  Dosimetry  Program  have  TLDs  that  are exchanged quarterly.  Factors necessitating more frequent exchange, i.e., monthly exchange, might  include  prior  exposure  history  of  the  unit  for  individuals  performing  similar  duties, prior exposure history of the individual beginning work as an occupational radiation worker, the  potential  for  accumulating  radiation  doses  at  a  high  or  irregular  rate,  training  of individuals, etc.  The appropriate exchange frequency for personnel dosimeters is determined by the IRSO. 4.3.2.  Normal Exchange Frequency. 4.3.2.1.  Most  occupational  radiation  exposure  circumstances  encountered  within  the USAF can be adequately monitored by using dosimeters exchanged on a quarterly (i.e., 3 months) basis.  Using quarterly monitoring periods generally provides optimum accuracy for low dose rate environments. 4.3.2.2.  Monitoring  at  shorter  frequencies  (e.g.,  monthly)  may  be  appropriate  under special circumstances, as detailed below: 4.3.2.2.1.  Occupational  radiation  workers  who  are  pregnant  (civilian  workers  must declare their pregnancy) will be monitored monthly (see Chapter 6). 4.3.2.2.2.  Certain  operations  having  an  exceptionally  high  radiation  exposure potential (e.g., greater than 1.25 rem per quarter) may necessitate a monthly exchange frequency. 4.4.  Determining Prior Occupational Dose. 4.4.1.  In  accordance  with  AFI  48-148  and  10  CFR  20.2104,  individuals  enrolled  in personnel  monitoring programs  should provide information  regarding their current  and past history of occupational radiation exposure at the time of enrollment. 24 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 4.4.2.  For each individual who is likely to receive, in a year, an occupational dose requiring monitoring, the IRSO shall: 4.4.2.1.  Request the records of the occupational internal and external radiation dose that the individual received during the current year. 4.4.2.2.  Attempt to obtain the records of cumulative occupational radiation dose. 4.4.3.  It  is  ultimately  the  individual’s  responsibility  to  provide  records  of  prior  non-AF occupational dose to the IRSO. 4.4.4.  In complying with the requirements of this paragraph, the IRSO may: 4.4.4.1.  Accept, as a record of the occupational dose that the individual received during the current year, a written signed statement from the individual, or from the individual’s most recent employer for work involving radiation exposure, that discloses the nature and amount  of  any  occupational  dose  the  individual  may  have  received  during  the  current year or 4.4.4.2.  Accept,  as  a  record  of  the  cumulative  radiation  dose,  an  up-to-date  AF  Form 1527-2  obtained  from  USAFSAM/OEA  if  the  individual  certifies  by  signature  that  the AF Form 1527-2 contains records of his or her complete radiation exposure history or 4.4.4.3.  Accept,  as  a  record  of  the  cumulative  radiation  dose,  an  up-to-date  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  (NRC) Form 4, Cumulative Occupational Exposure History, or equivalent, signed by the individual and countersigned by  an appropriate official (along with  office/title  of  responsibility:  IRSO,  supervisor,  contract  monitor,  etc.)  of  the  most recent  employer  for  work  involving  radiation  exposure,  or  the  individual’s  current employer; and 4.4.4.4.  Obtain reports of the individual’s dose equivalents from the most recent former employer for work involving radiation exposure or the individual’s current employer by telephone, telegram, electronic media or letter.  Written verification of dose data will be requested if the authenticity of the transmitted report cannot be established. 4.4.5.  The  IRSO,  as  required  by  this  chapter,  shall  take  into  account  an  individual’s  prior exposure  history  and  ensure  any  additional  occupational  radiation  exposure  received  as  a result  of  USAF  or  concurrent  moonlighting  operations  does  not  exceed  allowable occupational exposure limits as specified in 10 CFR 20 and AFI 48-148.  Individuals, whose prior  exposure  history  exceeds  allowable  occupational  exposure  limits  for  the  current calendar  year  either  as  a  result  of  AF  or  concurrent  moonlighting  activities,  will  be immediately removed from all duties involving occupational radiation exposure and will not be monitored by the Dosimetry Program. 4.4.6.  If  the  IRSO  is  unable  to  obtain  a  complete  record  of  an  individual's  current  and previously accumulated occupational dose, the IRSO shall assume: 4.4.6.1.  In  establishing  administrative  controls  for  the  calendar  current  year,  that  the allowable  dose  limit  for  the  individual  is  reduced  by  12.5  mSv  (1.25  rem)  for  each quarter records were unavailable and the individual was engaged in activities that could have resulted in occupational radiation exposure; and 4.4.6.2.  That the individual is not available for planned special exposures. AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 25 4.5.  Exposures  Incurred  during  Secondary (“Moonlighting”)  Employment.  USAF occupationally  exposed  individuals,  monitored  under  the  Dosimetry  Program,  are  prohibited from exceeding the dose limits specified in 10 CFR 20 and AFI 48-148, regardless of the source of exposure.  Because of this, it is necessary to consider the radiation exposure an individual may receive from employment outside the USAF.  Note:  AF occupational radiation workers may not wear their AF-issued TLDs while moonlighting. 4.5.1.  NRC  Form  4,  Occupational  Radiation  Exposure  History.    Upon  initial  entry  or  re-entry in the Dosimetry Program, radiation workers are required to provide radiation exposure histories [NRC Form 4 or as stated in 10 CFR 20.2104, (c)] from previous employers prior to beginning  work.    This  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  individuals  who  may  have  studied  at civilian or military institutions for advanced degrees.  The NRC Form 4 or its equivalent is used  to  record  radiation  exposures  from  previous  employers  outside  of  the  USAF.    This request is normally initiated by the IRSO with the individual signing a statement allowing the release  of  Privacy  Act  information.    IAW  AFI  48-148  all  dose  equivalent  histories  of previous  employment  outside  the  USAF  must  be  forwarded  to  USAFSAM/OEA  for inclusion in the MRER. 4.5.2.  NRC  Form  5,  Current  Occupational  Radiation  Exposure.    All  Air  Force  employees involved  in  off  duty  employment  and  registered  in  the  Dosimetry  Program  are  required  to provide current radiation exposure summaries.  The NRC Form 5, or its equivalent, is used to record  radiation  exposures  to  USAF  personnel  who  have  off  duty  employment  involving radiation  exposures,  and  are  provided  dosimeters  by  an  institution  other  than  the  USAF.  IAW AFI 48-148, the individual must furnish dose equivalent information from off duty employment  at  least  quarterly  to  the  local  IRSO.    The  IRSO  must  forward  this information to USAFSAM/OEA for entry into the MRER. 4.6.  Personnel Monitoring for Exposure to Radiation from an External Agency. 4.6.1.  All  persons  monitored  by  the  USAF  through  USAFSAM/OEA,  or  working  for  the USAF but monitored by another agency, must be registered in the Dosimetry Program. 4.6.2.  USAFSAM/OEA  sends  dosimeters  to  the  IRSO  or  medical  organization  conducting the  Dosimetry  Program.    Electronic  RDL  Listing  1523  containing  information  on  all registered  individuals  will  be  automatically  generated  and  available  via  the  Radiation Dosimetry Web secure website. (see 4.10.1) 4.6.3.  At the end of each monitoring period, the  IRSO  exchanges the dosimeters and ships the old dosimeters to USAFSAM/OEA as described in section 1.4.6. (T-2) 4.6.4.  USAFSAM/OEA  processes  all  dosimeters  and  the  IRSO,  using  the  Radiation Dosimetry Web secure website, retrieves a RDL Listing 1499 with the individual exposures for  the  monitoring  period.    For  more  information  on  the  Radiation  Dosimetry  Web,  please contact USAFSAM/OEA. 4.6.4.1.  The IRSO reviews the RDL Listing 1499 and distributes a copy to the supervisor of the monitored individuals. 4.6.4.2.  The  IRSO evaluates any administrative  doses assigned by USAFSAM/OEA on the  RDL  Listing  1499  due  to  lost  or  damaged  dosimeters,  to  determine  the  most  likely dose received by the individual for the given monitoring period (see Chapter 5). 26 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 4.6.5.  USAFSAM/OEA annually provides the IRSO, via the Radiation Dosimetry Web, with an AF  Form 1527-1 for  each individual entered in  the Dosimetry Program  for the previous calendar  year.    (For  more  information  on  the  Radiation  Dosimetry  Web,  please  contact USAFSAM/OEA.)    The  IRSO  provides  these  forms  to  each  individual  in  the  Dosimetry Program within 30 days of receipt. 10 CFR 19.13(c) states the IRSO will establish a system (e.g., logbook, copy of AF Form 1527-1 signed by the individual, etc.) to document receipt of this information by the individual. 4.7.  Personnel  Monitoring  for  Exposure  to  Radiation  from  Internally  Deposited Radioactive Materials. 4.7.1.  Introduction.  Internal  dosimetry  is  “…the  science  of  assessing  the  amount  and distribution of radionuclides in the body, and calculating resulting radiation doses to internal organs  or  tissues  over  specific  time  periods”  (ANSI/HPS  N13.39-2001).    The  intent  of  this section is to provide guidelines for achieving the minimum levels of acceptable performance in  evaluating  the  internal  radiation  doses  that  may  be  received  by  radiation  workers  from intakes of radionuclides. 4.7.2.  Bioassay 4.7.2.1.  Monitoring is  required for any individual  who is  likely to  internalize through a completed  exposure  pathway  (inhale  or  ingest,  primarily),  without  regard  to  protective controls, more than 0.02 times the Annual Limit of Intake (ALI) in a calendar year. (T-1) BE  and  Biomedical  Laboratory  personnel  will  maintain  radiobioassay  sampling  and internal  dosimetry  plans  on  file  for  units  with  the  monitored  individuals.  (T-2)  The conditions  requiring bioassay, as well as the methods and maximum intervals  discussed below,  are  designed  to  ensure  that  an  annual  intake  exceeding  this  amount  can  be quantified. 4.7.2.2.  For  continuous  operations  involving  unsealed  radioactive  material,  and  when individuals involved are likely to exceed 2% of the ALI as result of inhalation, ingestion, injection, or absorption of radioactive materials  routine bioassay (sampling on a regular interval)  should  be  performed  to  document  exposure  concomitant  with  intake  of radioactive material and to confirm that exposure controls are functioning. 4.7.2.2.1.  Baseline  bioassays  shall  be  collected  upon  beginning  of  employment  or before beginning work with radioactive materials. (T-2) When submitting the sample to  the laboratory,  request  analysis for the nuclide(s) to  which the individual may be exposed. 4.7.2.2.2.  Bioassay frequency, the maximum time that may elapse between periodic samples,  is  a  critical  component  to  ensuring  detection  of  the  intake.    The  bioassay frequency  for  a  specific  nuclide  is  determined  by  the  desired  level  of  detection, metabolic characteristics of the radioactive material, and the analytical method used.  IRSOs  and  PRSOs  implementing  routine  bioassay  programs  should  contact USAFSAM/OE email esoh.service.center@wpafb.af.mil,  to  discuss  frequency,  sampling  strategy,  and possible termination of sampling. (3764),  DSN  798-3764,  or at  1-888-232-ESOH 4.7.2.3.  Special  bioassay  should  be  used  to  quantify  radionuclide  intakes  when individuals involved in a planned project are likely to exceed 2% of the ALI as result of AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 27 inhalation,  ingestion,  injection,  or  absorption  of radioactive  materials.    Special  bioassay monitoring consists of pre-event and post-event samples: 4.7.2.3.1.  Pre-event assay: An assay sample should be conducted as close as possible to  the  start  date  of  the  event  that  has  the  potential  to  result  in  an  intake.    When submitting the sample to  the laboratory,  request  analysis  for the nuclide(s) to  which the individual may be exposed during the event. (T-2) 4.7.2.3.2.  Post-event  assay:  To  determine  the  exposure  associated  with  the  project, collect  another  bioassay  sample  during  the  project  (process  details  and  laboratory detection limits influence adequate sampling strategy) and/or after work is completed. (T-2) Consultation with USAFSAM/OE prior to the project can be key to the success of  the  risk  assessment.    Monitored  personnel,  in  conjunction  with  the  IRSOs  and PRSOs, shall make every effort to ensure that sampling and submission occur within the appropriate interval. (T-2) 4.7.2.4.  Sampling & Submission for Analysis 4.7.2.4.1.  Sample  Collection:    It  is  recommended  that  the  IRSO  or  PRSO  (or designee)  contact  USAFSAM/OE  Analytical  Services  Customer  Service  prior  to collecting  any  bioassay  samples,  including  those  for  baseline  purposes.    This  will ensure that the IRSO is  provided the necessary guidance resulting the most accurate analysis  and  results.    When  contacting  Customer  Service  the  following  information will be needed, as a minimum: 4.7.2.4.1.1.  What is the requirement for sampling? 4.7.2.4.1.2.  What is the maximum exposure potential (isotope)? 4.7.2.4.1.3.  When are the workers exposed and at what frequency? 4.7.2.4.2.  Detailed  instructions  on  bioassay  sample  collections  are  included  within the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine Laboratory Sampling and Analysis Guide § 5.8.    USAFSAM/OEA  Customer  Service  can  also  provide  guidance  regarding sampling media, protocol, and supplies. form (located 4.7.2.4.3.  Submission  of  Samples  to  the  Analytical  Services  Division:  The  Defense Occupational  and  Environmental  Health  Readiness  System  (DOEHRS)  Sample Submission Service  Center  website (https://hpws.afrl.af.mil/dhp/OE/ESOHSC/) is preferred acceptable documentation for  the  submission  of  bioassay  samples  to  USAFSAM/OE  for  analysis.    [Only  if DOEHRS is  unavailable one may use USAFSAM 2753 found  at  the ESOH Service Center  website].    For  sample  submission  questions,  contact  USAFSAM/OEA Customer  Service.    For  general  DOEHRS  assistance,  contact  the  DOEHRS  Support Office at USAFSAMDOEHRSSUPPORT@us.af.mil. the  ESOH at 4.7.2.4.4.  Sample Analysis:  All bioassay sample analysis conducted for the purposes of  evaluating  individual  radiation  exposure  (radionuclide  intake)  shall  be  conducted in accordance with ANSI/HPS N13.30. (T-2) 4.7.2.4.5.  Reporting:    USAFSAM/OE  will  provide  a  written  analysis  report  to  the IRSO detailing the results of the laboratory analyses.  In the event that the Installation RSO is not the Permit RSO, the report shall be forwarded to the Permit RSO. 28 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 4.7.2.4.6.  Results  Review  (QA/QC):  The  RSO(s)  shall  review  analytical  results  to verify  bioassay  analysis  was  conducted,  and/or  for  values  that  indicate  presence  of radionuclides  in  the  sample.  (T-2)  RSOs  should  contact  the  laboratory  with  any questions or if results appear aberrant. 4.7.3.  Internal Dose Assessment 4.7.3.1.  Initiating  Dose  Calculations:  USAFSAM/OE  will  use  non-baseline  bioassay analysis results to perform a dose assessment calculation in accordance with ANSI/ HPS N13.39. (T-2) 4.7.3.2.  Reporting  Dose  Assessment:  Upon  completion  and  verification  of  all calculations, USAFSAM/OE will provide to the IRSO a written summary of: information provided  on  the  bioassay  sample  submission,  calculated  intake,  percentage  of  the stochastic ALI, committed effective dose equivalent, and committed dose equivalent for the maximally exposed organ. (T-2) 4.7.3.3.  RSO  Concurrence:  The  USAFSAM/OE  Internal  Dose  Assessment  summary will contain a statement of concurrence for either the IRSO or PRSO to sign. (T-2) 4.7.3.3.1.  If  the  Dose  Assessment  is  tied  to  a  permitted  operation,  the  PRSO  will indicate concurrence by signing/dating the Dose Assessment summary sheet (located at  the  ESOH  Service  Center  website  (https://hpws.afrl.af.mil/dhp/OE/ESOHSC/) and returning it to the IRSO to facilitate to USAFSAM/OE.  If the dose is not from a permitted  operation,  the  IRSO  will  indicate  concurrence  by  signing/dating  the summary and returning it to USAFSAM/OE.  (T-2) 4.7.3.3.2.  Failure  of  the  RSO  to  complete    4.7.3.3.1  within  10  working  days  of receipt,  or  if  the  RSO  does  not  concur  with  the  reported  dose,  will  result  in USAFSAM/OE  elevating  the  summary  to  the  AF  Radiation  Safety  Committee  for resolution. 4.7.3.4.  Entry into the MRER:  Once the signed Internal Dose Assessment Summary is received, or upon resolution of non-concurrence, USAFSAM/OE will upload the results into  the  MRER.  (T-1)  These  results  will  be  reported  on  the  AF  Form  1527-1,  Annual Occupational  Exposure  History  to  Ionizing  Radiation  or  the  Form  1527-2,  Cumulative Occupational Exposure History to Ionizing Radiation. 4.8.  Wearing and Handling of Dosimeters. 4.8.1.  General. 4.8.1.1.  Dosimeters are to be placed in the proper position on the body prior to entering a radiation  area  or  handling  radioactive  materials.    Dosimeters  are  to  be  removed  upon leaving the radiation work place and stored in a location designated by the IRSO. 4.8.1.2.  Each  dosimeter  hanger  is  uniquely  identified  with  a  label  provided  by USAFSAM/OEA.  If it is necessary to make any changes to this label, the original print must remain legible to properly account for the card and dosimeter. 4.8.1.3.  Dosimeters  must  not  be  inscribed  with  any  type  of  name,  number  or  other identifying  information.    To  ensure  accurate  dose  assessments,  dosimeters  must  not  be AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 29 covered with any foreign material such as duct tape, masking tape or labels not furnished by USAFSAM/OEA. 4.8.1.4.  Each  whole  body  dosimeter  has  a  thin  Mylar™  window  designed  to  aid  in evaluating exposures from low energy radiation.  Dosimeters must be visually inspected before  use  to  confirm  this  window  is  present  and  intact.    Dosimeters  with  missing  or damaged windows are not to be used and must be returned to the IRSO for exchange. 4.8.2.  Whole  Body  Dosimeters.    This  type  of  dosimeter  is  designed  to  measure  radiation exposure to  the whole body (or major portion of the whole body) and is  to  be worn on the front  of the body below  the neck  and above the  waist on the outside of clothing. The  front surface of the dosimeter faces away from the body.  Normally, whole body exposures to beta, gamma and x-radiation are assessed by use of a single whole body dosimeter. 4.8.2.1.  When  a  lead  apron  or  similar  protective  garment  is  used,  a  separate  collar dosimeter may be issued.  If a separate collar dosimeter is issued, whole body dosimeters are  worn  on  the  outside  of  basic  clothing  but  beneath  the  protective  garment.  When  a separate  collar  dosimeter  is  not  issued  and  a  lead  apron  is  worn,  the  whole  body dosimeter is worn on the individual’s collar outside of protective shielding. 4.8.2.2.  In  certain  situations,  multiple  dosimeters  may  be  issued.    These  are  generally used  to  assess  localized  exposures  and  must  never  be  worn  in  lieu  of  the  whole  body dosimeter. 4.8.3.  Collar  Dosimeters.    These  dosimeters  are  used  to  assess  dose  to  the  head,  neck,  and lens of the eye, and are used to supplement the whole body dosimeter that is worn beneath a protective lead apron.  The collar dosimeter is  always worn outside any shielded protective covering and as near the thyroid as is possible. 4.8.4.  Neutron  Dosimeters.    Specialized  dosimeters  are  issued  to  monitor  occupational exposure  to  neutron  radiation.    Neutron  and  whole  body  dosimeters  are  always  worn simultaneously,  in  the  same  approximate  location  and  in  the  same  manner  as  whole  body dosimeters.  Examples of circumstances where neutron dosimeters may be required include: individuals working around medical or industrial accelerators that operate at greater than 13 MeV,  work  with  radioactive  materials  that  emit  neutrons  (e.g.,  238Pu/Be  sources,  252Cf sources,  or  nuclear  weapon  systems),  or  work  around  operating  nuclear  reactors.    The accuracy  of  neutron  dosimetry  is  greatly  enhanced  when  the  energy  spectrum  of  neutron radiation  to  which  the  individual  is  exposed  is  known.    The  IRSO  should  consult  with USAFSAM for assistance in characterizing site-specific neutron energy spectra. 4.8.5.  Extremity  Dosimeters.    Extremity  dosimeters  (most  commonly  finger  rings)  will  be worn  by  persons  determined  by  the  IRSO  as  likely  to  exceed  2  percent  of  the  applicable extremity  dose  limit  in  10  CFR  20  and  AFI  48-148.    Dosimeters  must  be  worn  underneath any protective garments (e.g., surgical gloves and leaded gloves), on the dominant hand and with  the  circular  indentation  facing  toward  the  radiation  source.    Extremity  dosimeters  are always worn simultaneously with whole body dosimeters. 4.9.  Storing Dosimeters. 30 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 4.9.1.  The IRSO designates dosimeter storage areas remote from ionizing radiation sources.  The  number  and  location  of  these  storage  areas  is  determined  by  the  IRSO,  as  needed  to support local programs. 4.9.2.  Dosimeter storage areas must be free of oil, dust, or other contaminants. 4.9.3.  Dosimeters must not be stored in areas of high temperature or moisture. 4.9.4.  A designated control dosimeter must be placed in each dosimeter storage area for the entire monitoring period. 4.9.5.  Dosimeters must not be stored in places not approved by the IRSO. 4.10.  The Radiation Dosimetry Web Secure Website. 4.10.1.  The  Radiation  Dosimetry  Web  (RDW)  is  a  secure  website  that  can  be  accessed  by the  IRSO,  the  TLD  Monitor,  and  assigned  Alternates.    To  obtain  access  each  user  must register  their  Common  Access  Card  to  the  Human  Performance  Wing  Support  (HPWS) Gateway.    Once  registration  is  complete  the  user  may  request  access  to  the  Radiation Dosimetry  Web  from  the  main  page  of  the  HPWS  Gateway.    Once  the  request  has  been processed by USAFSAM/OEA the user should receive an E-mail informing them of the final disposition of their request. 4.10.2.  The following six common dosimetry customer service tasks should be accomplished using this system: 4.10.2.1.  Base  Information  Change  Request––Used  to  change  information  about  your base: mailing address or delivery address, new IRSO (or alternate where applicable), new TLD  Monitor,  new  telephone  or  fax  number,  status  of  Dosimetry  Program  (active, inactive), etc. 4.10.2.2.  Personnel Information Change Request––Used to add a person to the program, delete (deactivate) a person in the program, or request a change, e.g., new area, different dosimeters. 4.10.2.3.  Declaration  of  Pregnant  Radiation  Worker––Self-explanatory  (module  of  the Personnel Information Change Request). 4.10.2.4.  Administrative Dose Change––Used to change the dose reported by the TLD or to change a dose that was assigned as a result of an unreturned TLD. 4.10.2.5.  Special  Requests––Used  to  order  additional  whole  body,  neutron,  and extremity dosimeters, hangers, clips, etc. 4.10.2.6.  Request Cumulative Occupational Exposure History to Ionizing Radiation (AF Form 1527-2––For radiation workers assigned to  your base or location.  If the radiation worker  is  not  currently  assigned  to  your  base/location,  or  if  the  worker  was  assigned within the last 5 days, you will not be able to generate an AF Form 1527-2 by using this service.  This service is available interactively. 4.10.3.  Routine Dosimetry Reports (1499-1, 1499-2, 1499-3)––These will be transmitted via the  Radiation  Dosimetry  Web.    Reports  will  be  in  PDF  format  and  will  be  available  for viewing and printing only.  The USAF Center for Radiation Dosimetry will no longer send a hard  copy  of  reports.    Authorized  users  will  receive  email  notification  that  a  dose  report  is AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 31 ready  for  viewing  and  printing.    Reports  will  remain  available  for  30  days  and  then  will automatically be deleted (reposts will be available upon request). 4.10.4.  Annual Dose Reports (AF Form 1527-1)––These reports also will be sent as described above. 4.10.5.  The  RDL  Listing  1523  is  now  an  electronic  form  available  through  the  RDW.  USAFSAM/OEA  no  longer  accepts  printed  listings  containing  requested  changes.    All changes must be submitted via the RDW for timely processing and data integrity.” (T-2) 32 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 Chapter 5 LOST, DAMAGED, OR NOT RECEIVED DOSIMETER PROCEDURES 5.1.  General.  On occasion, dosimeters may be lost, temporarily misplaced or damaged. 5.1.1.  If  a  TLD  is  found  to  be  lost  or  damaged  at  the  end  of  monitoring  period,  the  IRSO should explain the occurrence and assign an appropriate dose equivalent for the monitoring period  using  the  Human  Performance  Wing  Support  (HPWS)  Radiation  Dosimetry  Web (RDW)  Administrative  Dose  Change  (ADC)  module.    If  the  HPWS/RDW  ADC  module  is not  available,  then  the  dose  assignments  may  be  made  via  a  Memorandum  For  Record (MFR).  The ADC may be submitted any time after the TLDs for the monitoring period have been returned to USAFSAM/OEA/DOSIMETRY. 5.1.2.  If  a  TLD  is  not  included  in  a  received  shipment  from  the  field,  USAFSAM/OEA assigns an interim administrative dose, sends a notification to the base, and requests that the TLD  be  returned  immediately  or  that  an  evaluation  be  made  to  determine  the  appropriate dose equivalent that should be recorded for the monitoring period for the affected individual. Within  30  days  of  receipt,  the  IRSO  must  review  these  notices,  assign  an  appropriate  dose equivalent and report the dose equivalent to USAFSAM/OEA. (T-2) Note:  TLDs  are  used to measure the radiation exposure to AF personnel.  All necessary steps should be taken to ensure security and accountability of TLDs shipped to your facility. 5.2.  Determining the Administrative Dose for Lost or Damaged TLDs or Dosimeters. 5.2.1.  The following steps should be used in assigning an administrative dose: 5.2.1.1.  The  IRSO  reviews  radiation  exposure  records  of  the  monitored  individual  and coworkers for the previous twelve months. 5.2.1.2.  The first level supervisor prepares a statement of the worker's duties during the monitoring period and the worker signs the statement indicating concurrence. 5.2.1.3.  The  IRSO reviews the summary  of duties and previous  radiation exposures for the  work  area  and  assigns  the  best  estimate  of  the  dose  equivalent  using  one  of  the following methods: 5.2.1.3.1.  Occupancy  or  workload  information  and  radiation  dose  levels  at  the radiation source operator location. 5.2.1.3.2.  Data supplied by a supplemental dosimeter. 5.2.1.3.3.  Average of the individual’s previous occupational dose for the preceding 6 to 12 months if conditions prevailed similar to those during the period for which the dose is being estimated. 5.2.1.3.4.  Recorded  doses  accrued  by  coworkers  performing  similar  duties  under similar circumstances. 5.2.1.3.5.  Established  doses  for  specific  unit,  duty  position,  and  mission  (e.g.  using Intrinsic Radiation [INRAD] data). 5.2.1.4.  The  IRSO  can report the assigned doses to  USAFSAM/OEA/DOSIMETRY by using  the  ADC  module  of  the  HPWS/RDW  application  (preferred  method).    The  IRSO AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 33 may  also  report  the  assigned  doses  to  USAFSAM/OEA/DOSIMETRY  by  MFR  only  if the HPWS/RDW is unavailable.  If reporting via MFR, the report must include: 5.2.1.4.1.  The assigned  dose equivalent  and any explanation on how that  value was determined. 5.2.1.4.2.  The dosimeter number, type of dosimeter and monitoring period. 5.2.1.4.3.  The full name and full Social Security Number (SSN) of the individual. (T-2) 5.2.1.4.4.  The signed statement of concurrence.  If an individual chooses not to sign a statement  of  concurrence,  the  IRSO  must  note  the  reason.    The  individual  will provide  written  comments  to  the  IRSO  in  a  reasonable  time  frame  stating  the rationale  for  non-concurrence.  Copies  of  this  report  should  be  appropriately  filed and/or a scanned copy should be included in the OHMIS. USAFSAM/OEA also will maintain a copy after the dose has been entered into the MRER as an assigned dose. 5.3.  Dosimeters  Not  Received  By  USAFSAM/OEA.  The  TLD  Program  Monitor  and  the IRSO  must  attempt  to  locate  the  dosimeter.  If  found,  the  TLD  or  extremity  dosimeter  must  be forwarded to USAFSAM/OEA with a note indicating that the dosimeter or TLD was previously not returned to USAF/OEA. If not found, follow the steps in the previous paragraph to assign the appropriate  dose  equivalent.  If  no  response  is  received  by  USAFSAM/OEA  within  30  days  of the  end  of  the  monitoring  period,  a  list  of  individuals  who  have  not  received  a  RSO  assigned dose will be sent to MAJCOM BE and AFMSA/SG3PB for corrective actions. 34 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 Chapter 6 PERSONNEL MONITORING FOR PREGNANT RADIATION WORKERS 6.1.  General.  10 CFR 20.1208 and AFI 48-148 require the dose equivalent to an unborn fetus as  a  result  of  occupational  exposure  of  the  mother  be  ALARA,  not  exceed  5  mSv  (500 mrem) during  the  gestation  period,  and  is  recommended  be  limited  to  0.5  mSv  (50  mrem)  per  month.  Therefore,  pregnant  occupational  radiation  workers  must  be  monitored  monthly throughout  their  gestation  period.    USAFSAM/OEA  supports  this  requirement  by  providing monthly  badges  and  priority  processing  and  notification  of  dosimetry  results  for  identified pregnant  workers.    If  the  person  works  in  an  area  normally  monitored  quarterly,  base  program managers need to temporarily change her area registration to an area that is monitored monthly.  In  this  case,  storage  of  the  dosimeter  when  not  being  worn  must  be  kept  with  a  monthly  area control  dosimeter.    Otherwise  the  TLD  may  not  get  exchanged  at  the  proper  frequency  or  the area control will not be proper for the dosimeter.  To obtain the most accurate results, both the control and the personnel monitor TLD need to be stored and processed together. 6.2.  Installation Radiation Safety Officer (IRSO). 6.2.1.  Evaluates  the  exposure  potential  for  each  pregnant  worker  and  advises  the  attending physician accordingly. 6.2.2.  Prescribes  protective  measures,  including  enrollment  in  the  Dosimetry  Program. Arranges placement on a monthly dosimetry exchange cycle and verifies priority processing of  dosimetry  by  USAFSAM/OEA  to  ensure  compliance  with  limits  specified  in  paragraph 6.1. 6.2.3.  Makes  appropriate  recommendation(s)  regarding  reassignment  to  a  non-radiation work environment.   Recommends work restrictions necessary to ensure adequate protection of  the  embryo/fetus.    Assignment  of  pregnant  workers  to  alternative  duties  for  radiation protection purposes shall be without loss of all normal benefits  associated with  duties from which removed.  Pregnant workers are normally removed from radiation related duties under the following circumstances: 6.2.3.1.  Past monitoring (internal and external) indicates the worker will receive a whole body total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) of greater than 1 mSv (100 mrem) over the gestation period, or the potential for receiving this dose is unacceptably high. 6.2.3.2.  Work directly involving unsealed radionuclides unless authorized in  writing by AFMSA/SG3PB. 6.2.4.  The  IRSO  notifies  USAFSAM/OEA  of  pregnant  occupational  radiation  workers requiring monthly monitoring and priority reporting of results. 6.2.4.1.  This notification should be done by using the Radiation Dosimetry Web secure website. 6.2.4.2.  If notification via the website is not possible, it should be made by facsimile. 6.2.4.2.1.  Facsimile  reporting  must  include  the  individual’s  name,  SSN,  the installation and work area code, the estimated date of conception and whether or not the worker had any past history of external or internal radiation exposure. AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 35 6.2.4.2.2.  Since the facsimile will contain personal and medical information such as SSN  and  medical  conditions,  the  fax  cover  sheet  must  include  the  following disclaimer, “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.  This electronic transmission may contain personal medical information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (see AFI 33-332) and  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPAA)  (see  DoD 6025.18-R)  not  intended  for  disclosure  outside  government  channels  and  exempt from  mandatory  disclosure  under  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act,  5  U.S.C.,  552.

Radiation Workers on Extended Temporary Duty (TDY). 7.1.1.  TDY for periods of 90 days or less. 7.1.1.1.  Individuals  going  TDY  for  90  days  or  less  will  take  their  dosimeter  and  a designated  transit  control  dosimeter  with  them.    The  accompanying  control  dosimeter may  be  issued  from  spare  dosimeters  provided  to  the  home  base.    Note:  TDY  badges should be carried onto aircraft; checked baggage may be subject to x-ray radiation at  a  level  that  could  inadvertently  expose  the  TLDs  and  produce  a  measureable dose. 7.1.1.2.  Upon  return  from  TDY,  the  individual  will  ensure  the  dosimeter  and  transit control are turned in for processing at the next exchange interval.  In no instances will a dosimeter be kept for periods longer than 6 months. 7.1.2.  TDY for Periods Exceeding 90 Days. 7.1.2.1.  TDY/Deployed  Locations  Having  an  Established  Dosimetry  Program:    While TDY  to  a  location  with  an  established  Dosimetry  Program,  individuals  will  obtain necessary dosimetry at the TDY location.  If dosimetry support is provided by other than USAFSAM/OEA,  the  individual  is  responsible  for  ensuring  copies  of  their  dosimetry results are provided to USAFSAM/OEA for inclusion in the MRER. 7.1.2.2.  TDY/Within the Continental United States (CONUS):  Locations Not Having an Established Dosimetry Program.  Individuals on TDY for periods greater than 90 days to locations without an established dosimetry program will receive dosimetry support from their  sponsoring  organization  for  the  duration  of  the  TDY.    Support  will  necessitate providing  dosimetry  controls  and  ensuring  exchanges  are  made  in  a  timely  fashion.  Gaining organizations anticipating ongoing requirements of this nature are encouraged to establish their own dosimetry programs. 7.1.2.3.  TDY/ Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS): Locations Not Having an Established Dosimetry Program.  Individuals on TDY for periods greater than 90 days to  locations  without  an  established  dosimetry  program  will  receive  dosimetry  support from the nearest location with an established dosimetry program.  USAFSAM/OEA will provide  additional  dosimetry  support  to  the  location  providing  the  support  to  these individuals.  These procedures should be established before the member departs TDY for OCONUS locations. 7.2.  Members  or  Employees  of  Other  Services  or  Federal  Agencies  Who  Are Occupationally Exposed to Ionizing Radiation From Air Force Operations. 7.2.1.  Individuals  employed  by  other  military  services  or  other  federal  agencies  may  on occasion  be  occupationally  exposed  to  ionizing  radiation  while  working  under  USAF jurisdiction.  Examples of circumstances where this could occur include cooperative staffing of military MTFs, joint operations, etc. AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 37 7.2.2.  Individuals  having  a  primary  employer  other  than  the  AF  who  are  occupationally exposed while under USAF jurisdiction (i.e., while working with radiation sources subject to licensing,  permitting,  or  control  of  the  USAF)  shall  be  enrolled  in  the  Dosimetry  Program and shall utilize USAF-provided personnel monitoring. 7.2.3.  The  MRER  will  maintain  dosimetry  results  for  individuals  in  circumstances  of paragraph 7.2.4. 7.2.4.  In addition, dosimetry results for these individuals will be reported to the individual’s primary employer using procedures established between USAFSAM/OEA and the counterpart organization in the other federal agency. 7.2.5.  USAFSAM/OEA will establish procedures to  routinely request  and obtain dosimetry results from the US Army and US Navy personnel dosimetry centers on any USAF personnel who  have  received  personnel  dosimetry  services  from  those  centers  and  will  incorporate those results into the MRER as doses obtained outside the USAF. 7.3.  Visitors (Occasionally-Exposed Individuals). 7.3.1.  The IRSO may authorize visitors to enter a radiation area or high radiation area IAW AFI 48-148.  Visitors entering defined "Radiation Areas" or "High Radiation Areas" or that are likely to incur a deep dose equivalent in excess of 0.1 mSv (10 mrem) shall be afforded personnel monitoring devices (see paragraph 1.5.3).  The decision to provide either an EPD or TLD for entry into controlled areas should be based on the anticipated exposure potential during  a  single  visit  and  the  anticipated  number  of  visits  by  an  individual  in  a  year.    In  no case shall a member of the public visiting controlled areas be permitted to receive a dose that exceeds the 1 mSv in a year (100 mrem in  a  year) limit of 10 CFR 20 and AFI 48-148.   If EPDs are issued, the dosimeters must have been calibrated within the last year.  In addition, a log of all direct reading dosimeter readings must be maintained by the workplace supervisor and include the following: 7.3.1.1.  The date, time, and purpose of the visit. 7.3.1.2.  The visitor’s printed name, SSN, business address and phone. 7.3.1.3.  The dosimeter’s serial number and calibration date. 7.3.1.4.  The dosimeter reading before and after the visit. 7.3.1.5.  The dosimeter’s net exposure reading and net exposure time. 7.3.2.  The IRSO shall review all visitor dosimeter logs quarterly. 7.3.3.  The IRSO shall ensure USAFSAM/OEA is provided a copy of all positive or greater than  zero  log  readings  for  entry  into  the  MRER  within  10  calendar  days  of  the  end  of  the quarterly monitoring period. 7.3.4.  Visitors shall not enter areas where unsealed radioactive materials are used and the use of  respiratory  protection  is  necessary  to  maintain  exposures  of  visitors  below  100  mrem TEDE. 7.4.  Special Survey Dosimeters. 38 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 7.4.1.  The  IRSO  may  request  special  survey  dosimeters  (e.g.,  dosimeters  used  for  area surveys,  localized  exposure  determinations,  conducting  an  exposure  investigation)  from USAFSAM/OEA. 7.4.2.  Dosimeters  routinely  provided  by  USAFSAM/OEA  will  not  be  used  for  special surveys unless authorized by USAFSAM/OEA. 7.5.  Planned Special Exposures (as defined in 10 CFR 20). 7.5.1.  Planned special  exposures will  not be accomplished unless prior approval  is  granted by  AFMSA/SG3PB.    Requests  for  planned  special  exposures  will  be  signed  by  the installation commander and include the following: 7.5.1.1.  Justification for the planned special exposure. 7.5.1.2.  Radiological  Work  Plan  to  include  precautions  to  be  taken  to  keep  exposures received ALARA. 7.5.1.3.  Name, SSN and cumulative record of lifetime radiation exposure history (NRC Form 4 or equivalent) for each individual involved. 7.5.2.  Following  approval  by  AFMSA/SG3PB,  the  IRSO  notifies  USAFSAM/OEA  of  the planned special exposure and provides the individual’s name, SSN, work code and expected date of the planned exposure. 7.5.3.  Upon being notified by the IRSO, USAFSAM/OEA: 7.5.3.1.  Ensures individuals are entered into the Dosimetry Program. 7.5.3.2.  Provides dosimeters specifically for use during the planned special exposure. 7.5.3.3.  Provides  AF  Form  1527-2  for  each  individual  before  and  after  the  planned special exposure. 7.5.3.4.  USAFSAM/OEA  provides  priority  processing  of  planned  special  exposure dosimeters  and  bioassay  samples.  USAFSAM/OEA  provides  consolidated  external  and internal results via facsimile to the IRSO, along with a new AF Form 1527-2. 7.5.3.5.  The  IRSO  provides  these  results  to  all  individuals  involved  in  the  planned special exposure within 15 calendar days of determining the dose. 7.6.  Personnel Monitoring For U-2 Flight Operations. 7.6.1.  General.    U-2  training  and  mission  operations  routinely  require  pilots  to  fly  at altitudes and for durations where doses from cosmic radiation become a significant source of exposure.    Based  upon  flight  studies  conducted  during  training  operations  in  2012,  and  a following  laboratory  study  with  the  Pacific  Northwest  National  Laboratory,  the  European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), and the AF Radiation Dosimetry Laboratory, it has been determined that a specific monitoring program is required to accurately monitor and report  pilot  doses  as  a  result  of  this  unique  exposure  environment.    USAFSAM/OEA supports  this  requirement  by  providing  quarterly  Thermo  Scientific  Mark  N2  Electronic Personal  Dosimeters  (EPDs)  issued  directly  to  each  pilot  either  in  a  training  or  operations environment.    The  EPD  Mark  N2  will  be  the  sole  dosimeter  used  to  provide  accredited monitoring of pilots. (T-2) To obtain the most accurate results each EPD Mark N2 assigned AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 39 to a pilot will be powered “ON” during pre-flight and then powered “OFF” once the flight is complete. 7.6.2.  Installation Radiation Safety Officer (IRSO). 7.6.2.1.  The  IRSO  notifies  USAFSAM/OEA  of  each  U-2  pilot  attached  to  his/her installation and who require quarterly monitoring utilizing a Mark N2 EPD. If a U-2 pilot is  deployed  to  certain  locations  without  an  existing  IRSO,  the  IRSO,  of  the  installation from  which  the  U-2  pilot  deployed  from,  will  have  responsibility  of  managing  their dosimetry program. (T-2) 7.6.2.1.1.  This  notification  should  be  done  utilizing  the  Radiation  Dosimetry Customer Support E-mail address (USAFSAM.OEAL.Dosimet@us.af.mil) utilizing the  appropriate  level  of  encryption  for  PII,  Privacy  Act  and  Health  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act protected information. 7.6.2.1.1.1.  The  E-mail  must  include  the  individual’s  last  name,  first  name, middle initial, SSN (complete), date of birth, and gender. (T-2) 7.6.2.1.2.  If notification via the Radiation Dosimetry Customer Support E-mail is not possible, it should be made by facsimile. 7.6.2.1.2.1.  Facsimile  notification  must  include  all  the  information  listed  in  7.6.2.1.1.1 above. (T-2) 7.6.2.1.2.2.  Since  the  facsimile  will  contain  personal  information  such  as  SSN and date of birth, the cover sheet must either be a DD Form 2923 or include the following  disclaimer,  “FOR  OFFICIAL  USE  ONLY.   This  electronic transmission may contain personal medical information protected by the Privacy Act  of  1974  (see  AFI  33-332)  and  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and Accountability  Act  (HIPAA)  (see  DoD  6025.18-R)  not  intended  for  disclosure outside  government  channels  and  exempt  from  mandatory  disclosure  under  the Freedom  of  Information  Act,  5  U.S.C.,  552,  Exemption  6  may  apply.    Do  not release outside of DoD channels without the consent of the originator’s office. (T-0) If you receive this message in error, please notify the sender either by E-mail or telephone, and destroy all copies of this message.” 7.6.2.2.  The IRSO shall be responsible for U-2 pilots attached to his/her installation and the distribution of EPD Mark N2 dosimeters assigned by the USAF Radiation Dosimetry Laboratory to appropriate personnel prior to the beginning of each monitoring period. (T-2)  If a U-2 pilot is deployed to certain locations without an existing IRSO, the IRSO, of the  installation  from  which  the  U-2  pilot  deployed  from,  shall  be  responsible  for  the distribution of EPD Mark N2 dosimeters. (T-2) 7.6.2.3.  The IRSO shall be responsible for the collection, packaging, and shipment of all EPD Mark N2 dosimeters for U-2 pilots attached to their installation. This shall be done for the previous monitoring period in accordance with section 1.4.6 of this manual. (T-2) If a U-2 pilot is deployed to certain locations without an existing IRSO, the IRSO, of the installation  from  which  the  U-2  pilot  deployed  from,  shall  be  responsible  for  the collection, packaging, and shipment of all EPD Mark N2 dosimeters. (T-2) 40 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 7.6.2.4.  The IRSO notifies USAFSAM/OEA when monitoring of any U-2 pilot attached to  their  installation  is  no  longer  necessary  due  to  a  change  in  occupation,  separation  or retirement. (T-2) If a U-2 pilot is deployed to certain locations without an existing IRSO, the  IRSO,  of  the  installation  from  which  the  U-2  pilot  deployed  from,  shall  notify USAFSAM/OEA. (T-2) 7.6.3.  Physiological Support Squadron (PSPTS) 7.6.3.1.  A  PSPTS  staff  member  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  the  EPD  Mark  N2 assigned to a given pilot is powered “ON” and that the battery is viable prior to placing the device within the cockpit for each sortie. (T-3) 7.6.3.1.1.  The  EPD  is  powered  “ON”  by  pressing  and  holding  the  single  button located on the front of the EPD above the label for more than 2 seconds or until the EPD beeps and the display changes. 7.6.3.1.2.  A low battery is indicated by a small “AA” shaped icon in the lower left of the display on the EPD.  The battery should be replaced with another lithium ion (3.6 V)  battery;  however  an  alkaline  AA  will  suffice  for  short-term  operations.    NOTE:  The use of an alkaline AA will  require the battery  to be removed at  the end of each sortie to prevent battery rupture and subsequent damage to the EPD. 7.6.3.1.2.1.  The battery can be removed by using a US nickel placed into the slot on the battery cover located on the side of the EPD and gently rotating the cover 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  It is important to not force the battery cover as this can damage the cover and/or the EPD. 7.6.3.1.2.2.  The  battery  should  then  be  removed  from  the  EPD  and  disposed  of IAW established procedures for the local installation. 7.6.3.1.2.3.  Place a new battery within the EPD and reaffix the battery cover by reversing the steps listed above.  Once the battery cover is replaced the EPD will begin  the  start-up  sequence  and  run  a  full  diagnostic  of  its  operations  (requires less than 30 seconds).  If the EPD reports a fault, indicated by “F” followed by a number on the display, remove the battery, wait three minutes then replace.  If the EPD  repeats  the  fault  contact  the  Radiation  Dosimetry  Laboratory  for  further instructions as soon as practicable. 7.6.3.2.  The PSPTS staff member will secure the EPD Mark N2 within the cockpit in a manner that will not impair flight operations nor pose a health and safety risk to the pilot. (T-3) The EPD Mark N2 does NOT have to be affixed/secured to the pilot. 7.6.3.3.  Post  sortie  a  PSPTS  staff  member  will  be  responsible  for  removing  the  EPD Mark N2 from its storage location within the cockpit and for turning the unit “OFF”. (T-3) NOTE:  This includes removing the battery if an alkaline AA is being used. 7.6.3.3.1.  The  EPD  is  powered  “OFF”  by  pressing  and  holding  the  single  button located on the front of the EPD above the label until the display reads, “OFF”. 7.6.3.3.2.

Any dosimeter  and/or bioassay result exceeding any of the values in Table 8.1 represent an “abnormal exposure.” Table 8.1.  Abnormal Exposure Criteria.  8.2.  Abnormal  Exposure  Suspected  by  Base.  Any  dosimeter  suspected  of  receiving  an abnormal exposure will be forwarded to USAFSAM/OEA together with a control dosimeter and an identifying letter detailing the circumstances involved in the suspected exposure.  The control dosimeter  should  be  taken  from  that  monitoring  period’s  unused  stock  of  extras  unless  the exposure is believed to have occurred while the dosimeter was stored in its normal location on a rack  with  the  standard  control  dosimeter.    Whenever  an  abnormal  exposure  is  suspected,  the standard control dosimeter will be submitted along with the suspected exposed dosimeter and a control dosimeter from that monitoring period’s unused stock of extras and the standard control dosimeter replaced from the unused stock of extras.  If you have no unused stock of dosimeters, contact  USAFSAM/OEA  for  further  instructions.    Suspected  abnormally  exposed  TLDs  will receive priority processing at USAFSAM/OEA and the dose results will be reported back to the IRSO as soon as they are available. 8.3.  Abnormal Exposure Observed by USAFSAM/OEA Upon Processing a Dosimeter.  The IRSO  is  to  conduct  an  investigation  into  the  abnormal  exposure  and  submit  a  written  report within 30 calendar days on the findings of the investigation, IAW AFI 48-148.  Finalized reports must be sent to USAFSAM/OEA and the MAJCOM BE.  An advance copy of the investigation report should be sent to the MAJCOM BE as well as USAFSAM/OEA. AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 43 8.4.  Notification of Abnormal Exposures. 8.4.1.  USAFSAM/OEA  notifies  the  installation  IRSO  by  telephone,  within  72  hours,  and follows-up  with  a  facsimile  memorandum  of  apparent  abnormal  exposures.   The memorandum: 8.4.1.1.  Identifies the dosimeter and/or bioassay sample number. 8.4.1.2.  Includes the name, SSN, and occupational code of the individual involved. 8.4.1.3.  Gives  a  dose  equivalent  estimate  based  on  the  dosimeter  results,  bioassay concentrations, or both. 8.4.1.4.  Provides instructions to accomplish the required investigation IAW AFI 48-148. 8.5.  Exception.  When  an  assigned  dosimeter  is  not  returned  to  USAFSAM/OEA,  an Administrative Dose equal to the corresponding dose in Table 8-1, is automatically assigned for the  given  exchange  frequency.    These  doses  are  not  a  valid  representation  of  the  individual’s exposure and therefore will not be treated as an abnormal exposure.  The sole purpose of these types  of  dose  assessments  is  to  notify  IRSOs  that  actions  must  be  taken  to  correct  the individual’s records to more accurately reflect personnel exposure. 8.6.  Investigation.  The  IRSO  must  initiate  a  formal  investigation  for  abnormal  exposures  to ensure personnel that the IRSO, MAJCOM BE, and USAFSAM/OEA are aware of ANY actual abnormal  occupational  exposure  and  take  corrective  actions  as  necessary  to  avoid  exceeding annual  occupational  limits.  Note:  Other  investigations  may  be  indicated,  see  investigation action level definition in the glossary. 8.6.1.  Circumstances surrounding the abnormal exposure. 8.6.2.  The validity of the dose received. 8.6.3.  The portion of the body exposed. 8.6.4.  Any corrective actions required preventing recurrence. 8.7.  Written Report. 8.7.1.  The  IRSO  submits  a  written  report  on  the  findings  of  the  investigation  to USAFSAM/OEA and the MAJCOM BE within 30 calendar days of being notified about the possible abnormal exposure.  The report includes: 8.7.1.1.  Name, SSN, occupational code, and AFSC of the individual involved. 8.7.1.2.  Description of circumstances surrounding the abnormal exposure. 8.7.1.3.  Estimates of each individual’s dose equivalent to include a detailed discussion of how this value was determined. 8.7.1.4.  If  it  is  determined  that  the  individual's  dosimeter  was  inadvertently  exposed  to radiation  while  not  being  worn,  the  following  information  needs  to  be  determined  to assist in estimating the appropriate dose to be assigned for this monitoring period: 8.7.1.4.1.  During  the  monitoring  period,  did  the  individual's  activities  differ  from normal  activities  or  those  of  fellow  workers  during  the  same  monitoring  period?   If so,  in  what  way  did  they  differ  (e.g.,  did  the  workload  increase  or  decrease significantly)? 44 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 8.7.1.4.2.  Was the individual involved in any activities, which might have caused the dosimeter to indicate a higher or lower dose than normal? 8.7.1.4.3.  If the individual wore pocket dosimeters, what was the indicated exposure during the monitoring period? 8.7.1.4.4.  What is the individual's past dose history? 8.7.1.4.5.  What dose did the individual receive during normal periods of work? 8.7.1.4.6.  Provide any available evidence used in concluding the investigation.  The letter could potentially be used for medical and legal purposes so, therefore, must be complete. 8.7.1.4.7.  Corrective  actions  taken  to  prevent  recurrence.    Appropriate  corrective actions  might  include:    Instruction  on  the  proper  wear  and  uses  of  the  dosimeter, ensuring the adequacy of the radiation protection program, surveying and correcting faulty  equipment,  moving  the  dosimeter  storage  area  to  an  area  free  of  radiation sources, etc. 8.7.1.4.8.  Statement signed by the individual involved either supporting or contesting the investigation report. 8.7.1.4.9.  Results of any medical examinations (if appropriate). 8.7.2.  USAFSAM/OEA evaluates the written report and requests any additional information from  the  IRSO  as  may  be  necessary  to  fully  document  the  dose  received  and  updates  the MRER.  Upon notification by USAFSAM/OEA that the MRER has been updated the IRSO should  acquire  an  AF  Form  1527-2  for  the  individual  in  question  or  request  one  from USAFSAM/OEA.    USAFSAM/OEA  retains  all  supporting  documentation  for  the  dose assigned. 8.7.3.  The  IRSO  will  ensure  copies  of  reports  validating  the  occurrence  of  an  abnormal exposure are forwarded to AFMSA/SG3PB and to the applicable MAJCOM BE. 8.7.4.  USAFSAM/OEA ensures the MRER is updated accordingly. 8.8.  Termination  of  Investigation.  USAFSAM/OEA  will  review  reports  involving  doses considered as abnormal.  AFMSA/SG3PB evaluates the reports of abnormal exposure and either approves termination of the incident or requests additional information.  Following termination, USAFSAM/OEA  updates  the  MRER.    Upon  notification  by  USAFSAM/OEA  that  the  MRER has been updated the IRSO should acquire an AF Form 1527-2 for the individual in question or request  one  from  USAFSAM/OEA.    The  IRSO  ensures  the  individual  is  given  a  copy  of  the revised AF Form 1527-2. AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 45 Chapter 9 POTENTIAL OVEREXPOSURES 9.1.  General.  Any  dosimeter  and/or  bioassay  result  that  exceeds  the  applicable  dose  limits specified  in  10  CFR  20  and/or  AFI  48-148  shall  be  considered  to  represent  a  “potential overexposure”. Table 9.1.  Potential Overexposure Criteria. 9.2.  Potential Overexposure Identified by Base.  9.2.1.  An IRSO who is  notified by an individual, or suspects a potential overexposure may have  occurred, the  MAJCOM  BE  and AFMSA/SG3PB  by  telephone  and  follows-up  with  a  letter  (facsimile  or  scanned/emailed) explaining the circumstances.  This includes, but is not limited to, potential overexposures as a result of radiological or nuclear accidents or incidents, both garrison or deployed. immediately  notifies  USAFSAM/OEA, 9.2.2.  Following  notification  by  the  IRSO,  USAFSAM/OEA  immediately  provides  an encrypted  E-mail  or  facsimile  instructions  for  performing  an  investigation,  to  include  any bioassay  requirements,  and  requests  the  IRSO  return  any  dosimeters  and  (or)  bioassays  in progress at the time immediately to USAFSAM/OEA for priority processing. 9.2.3.  USAFSAM/OEA  provides  priority  processing  for  all  bioassay  samples  collected  in overexposure  investigations  and  immediately  reports  the  results  to  the  IRSO  by  telephone and facsimile letter. 9.2.4.  Written  Report:    The  IRSO  provides  a  written  report  of  the  investigation  findings through  the  MAJCOM  BE  to  USAFSAM/OEA  within  seven  (7)  calendar  days  of  being notified  of  the  potential  over  exposure.   Copies  of  this  report  are  provided  to AFMSA/SG3PB and the individual. 46 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 9.3.  Removal  from  Duties.  Individuals  that  have  possibly  received  an  overexposure  will  be removed  from  duties  involving  radiation  exposure  as  recommended  by  the  IRSO  to  the individual’s supervisor, pending completion of the final investigation report.  This removal from duty is not to be considered adverse personnel action.  If the final investigation report concludes the individual received an overexposure, AFMSA/SG3PB concurrence must be obtained before the exposed individual is allowed to return to radiation related duties. 9.4.  Potential Overexposure Identified by USAFSAM. 9.4.1.  Notification. 9.4.1.1.  When  a  dosimeter  or  bioassay  indicates  an  overexposure  may  have  occurred, USAFSAM/OEA  immediately  notifies  the  IRSO  by  telephone  and  follows  with  an encrypted E-mail or facsimile letter within two (2) hours.  Facsimile copies of this letter are provided to AFMSA/SG3PB. 9.4.1.2.  Following  telephone  notification  by  USAFSAM/OEA,  the  IRSO  immediately contacts  the  unit  commander  and  requests  the  individual  be  removed  from  all  duties involving  potential  radiation  exposure  until  an  investigation  of  the  incident  can  be completed.    The  IRSO  also  notifies  the  MTF  commander  who,  in  turn,  notifies  the installation  commander,  as  appropriate.    Notification  should  also  be  made  to  the appropriate MAJCOM BE. 9.4.2.  Investigation.  The IRSO investigates suspected overexposures in the same manner as abnormal  exposures  (see  paragraph  8.6).    An  overexposure  may  represent  a  potentially  or overtly injurious dose of ionizing radiation.  These investigations demand swift action, more detailed comprehensive documentation. reporting  procedures,  possible  medical follow-up and 9.4.3.  Written  Report.    The  IRSO  provides  a  written  report  of  the  investigation  findings through  the  MAJCOM  BE  to  USAFSAM/OEA  within  seven  (7)  calendar  days  of  being notified  of  the  potential  over  exposure.   Copies  of  this  report  are  provided  to AFMSA/SG3PB.  All reports should include the following information: 9.4.3.1.  Name, SSN, occupational code and AFSC of individual involved. 9.4.3.2.  Description of circumstances surrounding the potential overexposure. 9.4.3.3.  Estimates  of  each  individual’s  total  effective  dose  equivalent  to  include  a detailed discussion of how this value was determined. 9.4.3.4.  Root cause of the exposure:  Factors to be considered might include; deliberate exposure  of  the  dosimeters,  dosimeter  worn  while  the  individual  concerned  received diagnostic or therapeutic radiation  exposure as a  patient,  improper action  on the part of the individual in question, inadequate protective measures, faulty operation of equipment, or use of the dosimeter for other than personnel monitoring, etc. 9.4.3.5.  If  it  is  determined  that  the  individual's  dosimeter  is  erroneous,  for  whatever reason,  the  following  information  should  be  considered  in  estimating  the  appropriate administrative dose to be assigned for the monitoring period.  The report should provide any evidence available used in developing this estimate. AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 47 9.4.3.5.1.  During  the  monitoring  period,  did  the  individual's  activities  differ  from normal  activities  or  those  of  fellow  workers  during  the  same  monitoring  period?   If so,  in  what  way  did  they  differ  (e.g.,  did  the  workload  increase  or  decrease significantly)? 9.4.3.5.2.  Was the individual involved in any activities, which might have caused the dosimeter to indicate a higher or lower dose than normal? 9.4.3.5.3.  What is the individual's past dose history? 9.4.3.5.4.  What dose did the individual receive during normal periods of work? 9.4.3.5.5.  Corrective  actions  taken  to  prevent  recurrence.    Appropriate  corrective actions might include; instruction on the proper wear and uses of dosimeters, ensuring the  adequacy  of  the  radiation  protection  program,  surveying  and  correcting  faulty equipment, moving the dosimeter storage area to an area free of radiation sources, etc. 9.4.3.5.6.  Statement signed by the individual involved either supporting or contesting the investigation report. 9.4.3.5.7.  Results of any medical examinations (if appropriate). 9.5.  Termination  of  Investigation.  USAFSAM/OEA  will  review  reports  involving  doses considered  potential  or  true  overexposure.  AF  RSC  evaluates  the  reports  of  potential overexposures and either approves termination of the incident or requests additional information. (T-2)  Following  termination,  USAFSAM/OEA  updates  the  MRER.  Upon  notification  by USAFSAM/OEA that the MRER has been updated the IRSO should acquire an AF Form 1527-2 for  the  individual  in  question  or  request  one  from  USAFSAM/OEA.  The  IRSO  ensures  the individual is given a copy of the revised AF Form 1527-2. 48 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 Chapter 10 WEIGHTED EFFECTIVE DOSE EQUIVALENT (EDE) WHEN SHIELDED PROTECTIVE APRON IS WORN 10.1.  Applicable Population.  Occupational radiation workers certified by the IRSO as working exclusively  with  radiation  sources  not  subject  to  regulation  of  the  NRC,  and  wearing  both  a whole  body  badge  beneath  shielded  protective  clothing  and  a  collar  badge  worn  outside  the shielded protective clothing. 10.2.  General  Protocol.  Fluoroscopy  procedures  are  the  largest  source  of  occupational radiation  dose  in  medicine.    Fluoroscopic  and  special  procedures  may  account  for  90%  of  the total collective dose accrued by occupationally exposed persons working in general radiography.  The radiation dose to personnel performing these procedures is non-uniform, with relatively high doses to the head, neck, and extremities, with much lower doses to the trunk and other regions protected  by  shielding  (lead  aprons).    A  special  calculation  protocol  is  necessary  to  provide  a more  realistic  estimate  of  the  effective  dose  received  by  individuals  working  in  these  highly specialized  radiographic/fluoroscopic  work  environments.    Numerous  approaches  and  models have  been  proposed  to  address  the  issue  that  the  DDE  recorded  for  personnel  during  such procedures by a single monitoring badge worn on the neck above an apron will overestimate the effective dose equivalent (HE) by factors of 8 to 23, while a single monitoring badge worn at the waist under an apron will underestimate HE by factors of 1.2 to 60.  For x-rays having energies within  the  kilovoltage  range  commonly  used  in  diagnostic  radiology  (60  to  120  kVp),  the calculated values of HE range from 0.93 to 0.95 for 0.5 mm lead aprons and from 0.99 to 1.48 HE for 0.3 mm lead aprons.  This approximation is given by: Where: EDE = Effective Dose Equivalent  WB = Dose measured by the whole body badge worn under the lead apron WBCL = Dose measured by the whole body badge worn on the collar, outside the lead apron 10.3.  Applicability Criteria.  Weighting DDE may be applied if all of the following conditions are met: 10.3.1.  During  the  monitoring  period,  the  individual  works  only  with  machine  produced radiation sources. 10.3.2.  During  the  monitoring  period,  the  individual  never  works  with  radiation  sources regulated  by  the  NRC,  radioactive  material  permitted  under  the  USAF  Radioisotope Committee,  Section  91b  radioactive  materials  permitted  by  HQ  AFMC,  or  exposures  from intrinsic radiation from nuclear weapons. 10.3.3.  During the monitoring period, the individual is not enrolled in the pregnant radiation worker-monitoring program (generally indicated as “Area PF” by the IRSO). 10.3.4.  The whole body badge is worn on the front of the body, below the neck  and above the waist, underneath the lead apron. AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 49 10.3.5.  The collar badge is worn on the front of the body, at collar or neck level, outside the lead apron. 10.3.6.  Placement of the two badges is not interchanged during the monitoring period. 10.3.7.  If  any  of  the  above  conditions  are  not  met,  the  dose  of  record  is  the  highest  dose recorded for any dosimeter during that monitoring period. 10.4.  Example of Dose Recording.  When weighting is applied, the results obtained from both badges  must  be  recorded  on  the  individual’s  dose  record  together  with  the  calculated  EDE.  However,  only  the  calculated  EDE  is  added  to  the  cumulative  deep  dose  total  for  the  quarter, year to date, or lifetime.  An example of the application of this weighting protocol is shown in the following table: Table 10.1.  Sample of Weighting Calculation.  50 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 Chapter 11 FORMS, LISTINGS, RECORDS AND REPORTS 11.1.  General. 11.1.1.  USAF  Master  Radiation  Exposure  Registry  (MRER).

Remarks:  (Add/Del/Change): On the form, indicate any action required by USAFSAM/ OEA to be taken.  If adding an individual to the program, write "ADD" in this  column.  Ensure  that  the  AREA  in  which  the  individual  needs  to  be  added  is  also included  in  comment.  (i.e.,  ADD  to  Area  PF).    If  deleting  an  individual  from  the program,  there  are  two  possible  entries  for  this  column.    If  the  individual  has  worn  the TLD during the monitoring period, specify “DELETE/WORN (DW)” in this column.  If the  individual  has  not  worn  the  TLDs  during  this  period,  indicate  “DELETE/NOT WORN  (DNW)”  in  this  column.    If  any  personnel  or  dosimetry  data  must  be  changed, write  "CHANGE"  in  this  column,  along  with  the  proper  information  that  the  change needs to reflect (e.g., “CHANGE” last name to Doe).  This field is also used to indicate anything  that  may  be  pertinent  for  the  records  of  the  individual  being  monitored.    For example, if the dosimeter was not returned, write "NOT RETURNED," "TDY," "LOST," etc. in this column.  If the monitoring was for a visitor (e.g., one time monitoring), write "ONE  TIME"  in  this  column.    If  the  individual  is  deleted  from  the  program  due  to  a permanent change of station, write "PCS" in this column. 11.1.3.  RDL Listing 1499-1, Current Occupational Radiation Exposure Report.

IRSO upon from 11.1.5.11.  The USAFSAM/OEA/DOSIMETRY  should  compare  the  Form  1527-1  reported  results against the RDL Listing 1499 (all versions) results and investigate any discrepancies.  If no discrepancies are identified then the RDL Listing 1499 documents may be destroyed appropriately. the  AF receiving Form 1527-1 11.1.5.12.  The IRSO makes reasonable (i.e., at least two) attempts to provide a copy of the  AF  Form  1527-1  to  each  monitored  individual  and  establishes  a  system  (e.g., logbook, annotation on retained copy) to document each individual’s receipt of the form.  As a minimum, documentation should include the date provided, individual’s name and signature verifying receipt, and initials or signature of the IRSO or designee providing the form.  The IRSO shall retain the AF Form 1527-1 for a period of five (5) years. (T-1) For individuals  who  have  moved  from  the  installation  (e.g.,  permanent  change  of  station, retirement, separation), one attempt will be made to send their AF Form 1527-1 to their last  known  forwarding  address.  (T-2)  If  the  IRSO  can  confirm  that  the  individual completed a permanent change of station and was monitored by the Dosimetry Program for the remainder of the year covered by the AF Form 1527-1 at the gaining installation then an attempt to provide a copy is not required.  The monitored individual will receive the information on the AF Form 1527-1 that will be provided by the gaining IRSO.

AF  Form  2753,  Radiological  Sampling  Data:    The  IRSO  uses  this  form  to submit bioassay samples to USAFSAM/OEA for analysis.  The IRSO prepares AF Form 2753  before  submitting  samples  to  USAFSAM/OEA  for  analysis,  forwards  the  original copy  to  USAFSAM/OEA  with  the  bioassay  sample,  and  maintains  a  copy  until  results (i.e., updated 1527-1) are received from USAFSAM/OEA. 11.1.6.2.  NRC  Form  4:    The  IRSO  makes  a  reasonable  effort  to  collect  previous dosimetry histories for individuals having either past or present non-USAF employment.  USAF  personnel  moonlighting  in  jobs  where  they  are  monitored  for  radiation  exposure make  arrangements  to  routinely  (e.g.,  based  on  monitoring  period,  but  no  less  than quarterly)  provide  these  results  to  the  IRSO.    The  IRSO  ensures  these  results  are forwarded  to  USAFSAM/OEA  for  incorporation  into  the  MRER.    The  individual  bears ultimate responsibility for ensuring any non-USAF dosimetry results become part of the MRER. 11.2.  Statistical Summaries of Dosimetry Results. 11.2.1.  Annual Personnel Radiation Exposure Summary. 11.2.1.1.  Prior  to  1  April  of  each  calendar  year,  USAFSAM/OEA  will  submit  a personnel  radiation  exposure  summary  report  to  AFMSA/SG3PB  as  required  by  AFPD 40-2, Attachment 1. AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 63 11.2.1.2.

Zero  average  (all  results),  non-zero  average  (only  non-zero  results)  and maximum annual TEDE dose for all occupational codes.  Codes associated with NRC or  radioactive  material-related  activities  should  be  denoted  for  ease  of  reference.  Results should be presented in a bar-chart format and compared to the previous year and the previous 5 years. 11.2.1.3.2.  Zero average, non-zero average and maximum annual CEDE dose for all occupational codes.  Results should be presented in a bar-chart format and compared to  the  previous  year  and  the  previous  5  years.    Codes  associated  with  NRC  or radioactive material-related activities should be denoted for ease of reference. 11.2.2.  Annual  Exposure  Summary  Report  by  Occupation  Code.   Annually, USAFSAM/OEA will prepare a summary report of AF-wide radiation exposure data for the previous year showing the range and median recorded dose for each occupation code.  This report  will  be  distributed  to  all  bases  for  use  in  evaluating  exposures  considered  abnormal with respect to the applicable ALARA constraint. 64 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 Chapter 12 THE USAF MASTER RADIATION EXPOSURE REGISTRY (MRER). 12.1.  General.  In  accordance  with  10  CFR  19  and  20,  the  Air  Force  is  required  to  maintain permanent dosimetry records for all persons entered into the Dosimetry Program.  The MRER is a  computer  database  registry  maintained  by  USAFSAM/OEA.    The  MRER  houses  historical records of dose equivalent  data for all persons presently or formerly registered in  the program.  Depending on the age of the data, some internal dosimetry results may not be in the MRER, but are  instead  maintained  by  USAFSAM/OEA.    USAFSAM/OEA  is  the  sole  custodian  of  the MRER.  The MRER also will provide an individual’s historical dose due to military operations not considered in their occupational exposure history. 12.2.  Responsibilities. 12.2.1.  USAFSAM/OEA. 12.2.1.1.  Permanently  maintains  records  of  all  dosimetry,  internal  and  external,  for individuals entered into the Dosimetry Program. 12.2.1.2.  The  IRSO  (Dosimetry  Account  Custodian).  The  IRSO  reviews  all  records associated with the Dosimetry Program and reports any corrections to USAFSAM/OEA via  the  Radiation  Dosimetry  Web,  annotation  on  the  RDL  Listing  1523  or  via  written correspondence.  Correction of individual dose data in the MRER will only be made upon receipt of written request signed by the individual or after the IRSO submits the correct form using the secure website. 12.2.1.3.  Individual. The individual is responsible for reviewing his/her dosimetry results and  providing  any  corrections  in  writing  to  USAFSAM/OEA  through  the  installation IRSO. 12.3.  Forms and Reports Generated from Data in the MRER. 12.3.1.  AF 1527-1, Annual Report of Individual Exposure to Ionizing Radiation. 12.3.2.

Roentgen Equivalent Man or rem—The conventional unit of any of the quantities expressed as dose equivalent.  The dose equivalent in rem is equal to the absorbed dose in rads multiplied by the quality factor Q [(1 rem = 0.01 Sievert) and (1 rem = 1,000 millirem)].

Restricted area—An area, access to which is limited by the licensee for the purpose of protecting individuals  against  undue  risks  from  exposure  to  radiation  sources  and  radioactive  materials.  80 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 Restricted  area  does  not  include  areas  used  as  residential  quarters,  but  separate  rooms  in  a residential building may be set apart as a restricted area. Shallow-dose  Equivalent  (Hs)—The  external  exposure  of  the  skin  or  an  extremity  which  is taken as the dose equivalent at a tissue depth of 0.007 cm (7 mg cm2––the average depth of the germinal cell layer) averaged over an area of 1 cm2. Sum  Committed  Dose  Deep  Dose  Equivalent—A  dose  equivalent  category  used  on  RDL Listings 14991 and 14992 showing the total of the committed dose equivalent to a tissue and the whole body deep dose equivalent.

Stochastic  effects—Health  effects  which  occur  randomly  and  for  which  the  probability  of  the effect  occurring,  rather  than  its  severity,  is  assumed  to  be  a  linear  function  of  dose  without threshold.  Hereditary effects and cancer incidence are examples of stochastic effects. Survey—An  evaluation  of  the  radiological  conditions  and  potential  hazards  incident  to  the production, use, transfer, release, disposal, or presence of radioactive material or other sources of radiation.

Termination—The  end  of  employment  with  USAF  and  ANG  involving  personnel  radiation monitoring. Thermoluminescent  dosimeter  (TLD)—A  type  of  dosimeter  that  uses  powdered  or  solid phosphor materials (e.g., Li2B4O7, LiF, CaSO4) to record radiation exposures.  When heated, the phosphor  emits  light  proportional  to  the  amount  of  radiation  energy  absorbed.    This  type  of dosimeter consists of a card and a holder (badge). TLD  Holder—A  device  used  to  hold  the  four  TLD  elements  in  the  whole  body,  neutron  and collar dosimeter. AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 81 TLD Hanger—A term used to describe the device used to attach a TLD holder on an individual.

Unrestricted  area—An  area,  access  to  which  is  neither  limited  nor  controlled  for  purposes  of radiation protection. User—An individual delegated with the authority to use, operate, or store radiation sources and devices.

Note:  For  very  high  doses  received  at  high  dose  rates,  units  of absorbed dose (e.g., rad and Gray) are appropriate, rather than units of dose equivalent (e.g., rem and Sievert). Visitor—A person who does not normally work in an USAF controlled radiation area, but who may be authorized to enter the area by the IRSO providing suitable dosimetry and/or protective equipment is available. Week—Seven consecutive days starting on Sunday. Weighting  factor  wT,  for  an  organ  or  tissue  (T)—–The  proportion  of  the  risk  of  stochastic effects resulting from irradiation of that organ or tissue to the total risk of stochastic effects when the whole body is irradiated uniformly.

The licensee may change the starting date of the year used to determine compliance  by  the  licensee,  provided  that  the  change  is  made  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  and that no day is omitted or duplicated in consecutive years.  82 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 Attachment 2 “DECISION TREES” A2.1.  These  “decision  trees”  are  designed  to  aid  in  evaluating  the  need  for  enrolling  an individual in the Dosimetry Program. A2.2.  When asked for guidance on whether an individual needs to be provided with dosimetry services, first determine if dosimetry is mandatory from AFI 48-148, the radioactive material use permit, and other sources.  Some occupations where dosimetry is generally mandated are nuclear medicine  technicians,  radiologists  and  radiology  technicians,  non-destructive  inspection technicians,  pregnant  radiation  workers,  and  personnel  entering  high  radiation  areas.    Many circumstances will be less clearly defined however, and in such cases, the "decision trees" on the following pages may be  used to  assist  in deciding whether or not  to  enroll an individual in  the Dosimetry Program. A2.3.  The following "decision trees" are only advisory in nature.  They must not be represented as official policy of USAFSAM/OEA or of AFMSA/SG3PB. A2.4.  Except in cases where personnel dosimetry is mandated by AFI 48-148 or other regulation or  law,  the  decision  on  who  receives  this  service  is  made  at  the  local  base  level.  USAFSAM/OEA will provide dosimetry if desired at local base level, even if the "decision tree" indicates it is not required. AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 83 Figure A2.1.

Air Force Whole Body Dosimeters. Table A3.1.  Composition of AF Whole Body Dosimeter.  A3.1.1.  Evaluating  Radiation  Dose  using  Whole  Body  Dosimeters.    The  Air  Force Dosimetry System utilizes a dose algorithm capable of calculating external whole body doses from photon, beta, and neutron radiation fields.  The algorithm calculates absorbed radiation doses from  exposures to pure and mixed x-ray,  gamma ray,  and neutron sources  as well as beta particles that may occur in work environments.  The range of radiation fields over which the algorithm is applicable is defined by the range of energies of each radiation type used in the algorithm development. A3.1.1.1.  Applicable  Radiations.    Photon  dose  calculations  accommodate  a  range  of photon  energies  from  20  to  1.3  MeV.    The  photon  sources  used  for  algorithm development  were  chosen  for  applicability  to  the  NVLAP  proficiency-testing  category IIA  (photons  general).    The  beta  ()  shallow  and  eye  dose  calculations  apply  to  average beta energies between 0.556 MeV (90Sr/90Y) and 0.267 MeV (204Tl). A3.1.1.2.  Evaluating Neutron Exposures with the Whole Body TLD.  The neutron dose calculation  is  specific  for  deuterium  oxide  (D2O)  (heavy  water)  moderated  252Cf.    This source/geometry  is  used  to  generally  simulate  a  nuclear  power  plant  neutron  energy spectrum.    The  neutron  spectrum  greatly  affects  dosimeter  response  and,  consequently, can have a significant impact on the dose equivalent assessed for individuals wearing the badge.    Monitoring  programs  for  neutron  exposures  should  be  coordinated  with USAFSAM/OEA  and  USAFSAM/OEA  to  determine  whether  neutron  spectroscopy measurements  are  required  to  provide  an  accurate  determination  of  neutron  dose.    The dose  processing  software  has  been  customized  to  allow  the  use  of  customer-specific; source  determined  neutron  factors  to  accommodate  neutron  sources  other  than  D2O moderated  252Cf.  When available, use of customer-specific neutron factors is preferred.  Note:  When neutron exposure is expected a neutron specific TLD should be worn. A3.1.1.3.  Algorithm  Limitations  for  Neutron  Fields.    All  neutron  fields  will  have  a gamma  component  and  a  beta  component.    Differentiating  neutron  external  exposure, gamma  exposure,  and  beta  exposure  is  important  because  of  the  difference  in  quality AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 87 factors (Q) for each and the need to determine the beta component of the shallow dose.  The  need  to  differentiate  these  doses  is  the  reason  the  UD-802  has  two  phosphors (CaSO4:Tm  and  Li2B4O7:Cu)  and  the  Air  Force  uses  two  holders––one  for  beta/gamma fields,  smoky  (clear);  and  one  designed  for  neutron  detection.    The  CaSO4:Tm  is relatively  insensitive  to  neutron  radiation  but  is  sensitive  to  beta  and  gamma.    The Li2B4O7:Cu  phosphor  is  sensitive  to  all  three  types  of  radiation.    The  general  approach used is to design the holders to emphasize a phosphor’s response to one of the three types of  radiation  of  concern  and  then  use  algorithms  to  convert  the  phosphor’s  response  to gamma dose, neutron dose, and shallow (basically skin) dose. A3.1.1.3.1.  The  process  in  beta/gamma  fields  is  relatively  simple.    The  holder (smoky/clear) is designed to shield CaSO4:Tm phosphor from all beta radiation and to allow  the  Li2B4O7:Cu  to  respond  to  both  beta  and  gamma  radiation.    CaSO4:Tm phosphor  response  will  be  directly  related  to  the  gamma  dose  (deep  dose).    An algorithm  is  used  that  uses  the  CaSO4:Tm  phosphor  response  to  essentially  remove the gamma response from the Li2B4O7:Cu phosphor.  The remaining is attributable to the beta (shallow) dose. A3.1.1.3.2.  The  process  in  neutron  fields  is  more  complex  because  there  are  three types of radiation  (beta,  gamma  and neutron) and only two phosphors.  The holders are used to  make up the difference.  The  yellow holder for the neutron dosimeter is designed  to  maximize  the  response  of  the  Li2B4O7:Cu  phosphor  to  neutrons  and  it does this by adding sufficient plastic shielding to eliminate all beta radiation.  As with the smoky/clear badge, the CaSO4:Tm phosphor is used to measure the gamma dose and  is  shielded  from  all  beta  radiation.    This  means  the  neutron  dosimeter  (yellow holder) cannot measure beta radiation. A3.1.1.3.3.  This shortcoming is overcome also by wearing the beta/gamma dosimeter (smoky/  clear)  where  the  holder  is  designed  to  allow  beta  irradiation  to  reach  the Li2B4O7:Cu  phosphor.  The  additional  challenge  is  that the  Li2B4O7:Cu phosphor  in the  beta/gamma  dosimeter  responds  to  both  beta  and  neutron  radiation.    In  a procedure  similar  to  the  one  above,  an  algorithm  uses  the  responses  of  the  gamma-optimized phosphor (CaSO4:Tm in both holders) and the neutron optimized phosphor (Li2B4O7:Cu in the yellow holder) to separate the neutron and gamma responses from the  Li2B4O7:Cu  phosphor  in  the  smoky/clear  holder.    As  above,  the  remaining response is due to beta (shallow) dose. A3.1.1.4.  Lower  Limit  of Detection.  At low dose levels,  normal  statistical  variation in the  element  readings  makes  calculation  of  energy  specific  correction  factors  inherently unreliable.  An LLD study was performed using the protocol specified by the Department of  Energy  Laboratory  Accreditation  Program  (DOELAP)  standard  in  publication  DOE-EH-0027.  The LLDs for most radiations evaluated in the algorithm were calculated to be between  0.001  –  0.0025  mSv  (0.1  -  2.5  mrem).    Because  of  increased  uncertainties inherent  with  field  deployment  of  personnel  dosimeters,  an  administratively  determined minimum  dose  level  of  0.1  mSv  (10  mrem)  is  applied  when  reporting  doses  to  the MRER.    This  is  consistent  with  generally  accepted  LLD  reporting  practices  throughout the external radiation dosimetry industry. 88 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 A3.1.1.5.  High  Responses.    High  range  doses  require  special  attention.    Any  element reading above 417 mR* (element  readout) is reported on the raw data printout obtained after  the  readout  is  complete  .    If  the  estimated  deep  dose  on  a  dosimeter  issued  to  a person (as opposed to a dosimeter used for calibration, blind testing, or similar purposes) is greater than 417 mrem and the element glow curves are satisfactory, the base IRSO and the Air Force Radioisotope Committee (RIC) are contacted .  The TLD is isolated and a follow-up  investigation  is  initiated  as  detailed  in  the  Dosimetry  Laboratory  Operating Instructions (OIs) and the Air Force Manual (AFMAN).  The high reading is noted on the dose processing form. A3.1.2.  Evaluating  Radiation  Doses  using  Neutron  Dosimeters.    The  Air  Force  neutron dosimeter uses the same TLD as is included with the whole body dosimeter.  A specialized neutron hanger with  a 314 mg/cm2 cadmium  filter over the front  of Element 1 is  provided.  The cadmium filter improves the dosimeter’s response to the wide range of neutron energies that  may  be  operationally  encountered.    As  noted  above,  the  amber  neutron  dosimeter  is never  worn  alone,  but  in  combination  with  the  standard  “smoke”  colored  dosimeter/hanger combination. Table A3.2.  Composition of AF Neutron Dosimeter.  A3.1.2.1.  Applicable Radiations. Photon response of the amber hanger UD-802 dosimeter is characterized  at  gamma  photon  energy  of  662  keV  (137Cs).    The  photon  sources  used  for algorithm  development  were  chosen  for  applicability  to  the  NVLAP  proficiency  testing categories II and VI.  The neutron dose calculation is specific for D2O moderated 252Cf.  This type of source is used to generally simulate a nuclear power plant neutron energy spectrum.  The  neutron  spectrum  greatly  affects  the  dose  equivalent  of  the  neutron  exposure.    If  field neutron  energies  can  be  identified  and  measured,  site-specific  correction  factors  can  be applied to increase the accuracy of the dose estimate. A3.2.  Air Force Extremity Dosimeters. AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 89 A3.2.1.  As stated in paragraph 3.2.2, the dose calculation algorithms for the single element extremity  dosimeter  (EXT-RAD)  do  not  automatically  compensate  for  exposures  to  beta radiation  at  energies  other  than  those  used  to  characterize  the  dosimeter  (i.e.,  0.556  MeV 90Sr/90Y and 0.267 MeV 204Tl).  Because of this inherent limitation in dosimeter design, it is important that the customer advise the laboratory of the type and energy of beta radiation for which the dosimeter is to be evaluated so that appropriate correction factors can be applied to compensate  for  extremity  dosimeter  under  response  with  low  energy  beta  ()  radiations.  Experimental  data  illustrates  that  when  exposed  to  radiation  from  204Tl,  the  EXT-RAD dosimeter exhibits significant under response when compared to that obtained from the same delivered dose of 90Sr/90Y.  The EXT-RAD will not be sensitive to very low energy  emitters like 14C or tritium (3H), most alpha emitters (although it  may respond to the characteristic x-rays they emit), or to low energy x-ray (low voltage tubes). A3.2.2.  The  approximations  listed  in  Table  A3.3  may  be  applied  to  compensate  for anticipated  EXT-RAD under response when the identity of the beta emitter is known.  It is essential  that  the  customer  inform  USAFSAM/OEA  of  the  energy  of  beta  radiation  desired for evaluating dosimeter results so that appropriate energy correction factors can be applied.  Unless otherwise specified by the customer, the calculation software presumes that the beta radiation is of an energy closely approximating that of 90Sr/90Y (0.556 MeV). Table A3.3.  Response vs. Energy––Bicron/Harshaw Extremity Dosimeters. A3.2.3.  Bicron/Harshaw EXT-RAD Extremity Chipstrate Dosimeter:  The Bicron/ Harshaw EXT-RAD  extremity  dosimeter  is  a  single-element  “ring”-type  dosimeter.    The  active phosphor  EXT-RAD  dosimeter  is  a  LiF:Mg,Tl  chip  with  a  permanent,  individual  barcode.  The  manufacturer  refers  to  the  chip/barcode  assembly  as  a  “chipstrate.”    The  chipstrate  is  90 AFMAN48-125  4 OCTOBER 2011 heat  sealed  into  a  plastic  throwaway  pouch  with  adjustable  attachment  straps  to  form  the complete dosimeter.  The chipstrate has inherent attenuation of approximately 100 mg/cm2.  The pouch adds an additional 7 mg/cm2 attenuation, for a total attenuation of approximately 107  mg/cm2.    Absorbed  doses  are  calculated  based  on  the  background-corrected  element response exhibited when the dosimeter is read in a properly calibrated Bicron/Harshaw 6600 Automatic TLD reader. A3.2.3.1.  Ring  response  is  calibrated  using  a  number  of  radiation  sources  including 137Cs, 90Sr/90Y, and 204Tl. A review of experimental data from test irradiations made by  the  Pacific  Northwest  National  Laboratory  (PNNL)  showed  that,  when  exposed  to low-energy  radiation from 204Tl, the Air Force EXT-RAD dosimeter under-responds by about  50%.    This  means  that  the  energy  compensation  coefficient  (ECC)-corrected  raw data  results  for  an  EXT-RAD  dosimeter  exposed  to  204Tl  are  about  half  the  actual absorbed dose equivalent.  The calculated ECC (En) for 204Tl with the USAF EXT-RAD dosimeter is 0.50. Figure A3.1.  EXT-RAD "band-aid" Chipstrate Extremity Dosimeter. Figure A3.2.
