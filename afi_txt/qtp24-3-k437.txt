Purpose  various  based  on  vehicle  type  (cargo  movement,  passenger movement, emergency services support, etc.).  5.1.2.2.2.   Role  in  the  mission  (Unit/Base/Community  (during  natural  disasters)/Air Force). 5.1.3.  M-series  trailer  design.    The  design  of  an  M-series  trailer  varies  depending  on  the vehicle type.  Refer to the manufacturer’s operator’s manual for additional information on the specific M-series trailer being operated, and to the data plate for safe load capacity guidance.  The M-series trailer normally can be identified by the following characteristics:  5.1.3.1.  All  trailers  are  designed  to  be  towed  by  a  towing  vehicle  without  airbrake connections.    A  handbrake  lever  and  cable  assembly  located  on  each  side  of  the  trailer activates a handbrake at each wheel.  Control of each handbrake is independent.  5.1.3.2.  In some cases, in  addition to  handbrake lever-activated handbrakes, the trailers are equipped with an inertia-actuated hydraulic brake system.  5.1.4.  Flatbed trailers design.  See Figure 5.1.  5.1.4.1.  Used to carry mounted systems over highways and cross-country.  5.1.4.2.  All trailers have an air/hydraulic brake system which receives air pressure from the towing vehicle through inter-vehicular air hoses.  5.1.4.3.  Leveling jacks on the four corners of the trailers provide stability during loading and off-loading.     Figure 5.1.  Flatbed Trailer Design.    5.1.5.  Chassis trailer design.  See Figure 5.2.  5.1.5.1.  The chassis trailer design is an open-frame, single-axle, super single or dual wheel configuration  trailer  chassis.    The  chassis  trailer  is  primarily  used  to  transport  electric generators. It can be used on improved and unimproved roads, and can be used with the Mine Clearing Line Charge (MICLIC).  Figure 5.2.  Chassis Trailer Design.   5.1.5.2.  Common features.   5.1.5.2.1.   Electrical system.  Receives its power from the towing vehicle through the trailer  intervehicular  cable  assembly.    Provides  power  to  the  antilock  brake  system (ABS) and taillights located at the rear of the trailer.  5.1.5.2.2.   Brake system.  Note:  Later models are equipped with ABS.  5.1.5.2.2.1.  The  ABS  is  a  self-monitoring  electronic  system  that  works  with  the trailer's air/hydraulic brakes.  When powered by the towing vehicle, the ABS will constantly  monitor  trailer  wheel  speed  and  control  trailer  brake  function  during wheel  lock  situations.    This  system  improves  vehicle  stability  and  control  by reducing trailer wheel lock during braking.  See Figure 5.3.  Figure 5.3.  Antilock Brake System.      Table 5.1.  Brake Components.  Component Gladhands Air Filters Air Lines Emergency Relay Valve Air Reservoir Air Brake Chamber Hydraulic Master Cylinder Lines Wheel Cylinders Brake Shoes    Description The coupling point for the trailer to the towing vehicle.  Marked to ensure correct hookup, one for emergency and the other for service. The air filters clean incoming air from towing vehicle  and  reduce  moisture  and  foreign matter. Extend  from  the  air  filters  to  supply  service and  emergency  air  to  the  emergency  relay valve, air reservoir and air brake chamber. Controls  the  braking  system  of  the  trailer.  Based on the air pressure signals received from the towing vehicle, it will apply or release the service brakes or it will initiate an emergency brake application. The air reservoir stores the system air pressure minimum  that  operates  the  brake  system.  Pressure  to  the  reservoir  is  initially  supplied and  then  maintained  through  the  emergency supply  line  from  the  towing  vehicle  through the emergency valve. The air brake chamber converts air pressure to mechanical  motion.    This  movement  through the  hydraulic  master  cylinder  applies  the brakes.    When  air  pressure  in  the  air  brake chamber is released, spring action releases the brakes. The  hydraulic  master  cylinder  converts  the mechanical motion of the air brake chamber to hydraulic  pressure  which  travels  through  the hydraulic lines to the wheel cylinders. The wheel cylinders convert system hydraulic pressure  to  mechanical  motion  and  force  the brake lining against the brake drum. Cause friction to slow or stop the trailer. 5.1.6.  Cargo trailer design.  See Figure 5.4  Figure 5.4.  Cargo Trailer Design.    5.1.6.1.  Common  cargo  trailer  components.    See  manufacturer’s  operator’s  manual  for model specific description.

Component Dropped Axle Frame Spring Assemblies Cargo Body Rear Stabilizer Rack and Tailgate Assembly Canvas Cover Assembly Electrical System Brake System Drawbar Coupler Breakaway Chain Hydraulic Brake Actuator Assembly Intervehicular Cable Description  Attaches to the towing vehicle and controls the master  cylinder.    When  the  towing  vehicle goes  forward,  the  drawbar  coupler  is  pulled and the brakes are released.  When the towing vehicle  slows  down,  the  trailer  pushes  the drawbar  ring  into  the  towing  vehicle  and applies the brakes. Provides for emergency braking of trailer. Transmits braking forces from towing vehicle to  trailer  and  service  brakes  by  means  of  a drawbar  coupler,  master  cylinder,  hydraulic brake tubes and hose, and wheel cylinders. Provides electrical connection between trailer and towing vehicle. Composite Light Tiedown Shackles Chassis Front Support Leg Safety Chain U-Bolt Cargo Body Rear Stabilizer Rack Assembly Canvas Cover Assembly Tailgate Assembly  5.1.7.

The following guidance pertains to operating  all M-series trailers (with towing vehicle).  Later in the section, additional guidance pertaining to the flatbed M-series trailer, chassis M-series trailer, cargo M-series trailer and water tank M-series trailer is provided.    This  guidance  is  not  all-inclusive.    Trainer  and  trainee  should  refer  to  the manufacturer’s operator’s manual, Pintle Hook Lesson Plan, Hazardous Material Lesson Plan and AFMAN 24-306 for comprehensive guidance applicable to the specific  M-series trailer type/model being used.  5.5.1.1.  Towing procedures.  5.5.1.1.1.   When  trailer  is  coupled,  always  start  and  stop  towing  vehicle  slowly  and gradually.  Do this whether or not trailer is loaded.  5.5.1.1.2.   Sudden and fast acceleration will cause hydraulic brakes to apply.  5.5.1.1.3.   When driving towing vehicle and trailer, overall length of unit must be kept in mind when turning and passing other vehicles.  Because unit is hinged in the middle, turning and backing are also affected.  Heavier payloads will increase stopping distance and decrease off-road maneuverability.  5.5.1.2.  Turning.  5.5.1.2.1.   When turning corners, allow for the fact that the trailer wheels turn inside the turning radius of the towing vehicle.  5.5.1.2.2.   To make a right turn at an intersection, drive towing vehicle partway into the intersection, then cut sharply to the right.  This will allow for the turning radius of trailer, and keep trailer wheels off the curb.  5.5.1.3.  Backing.  5.5.1.3.1.   Always back the towing vehicle slowly and gradually.  5.5.1.3.2.   Always use a spotter.  The operator must maintain visual contact with the spotter  at  all  times.    If  visual  contact  is  lost,  the  operator  will  immediately  stop  the vehicle.    See  AFMAN  24-306  for  additional  guidance  on  standard  AF  spotter  hand signals and additional spotter safety guidance. 5.5.1.3.3.   Adjust all towing vehicle rearview mirrors before backing, as needed. 5.5.1.3.4.   When  backing,  rear  of  trailer  will  move  in  opposite  direction  in  which towing vehicle is turned.  When towing vehicle is turned to the right, rear of trailer will go left.  When towing vehicle has turned and backing in a straight line is required, turn the towing vehicle in direction trailer is moving.  This will slowly bring towing vehicle and trailer into a straight line.    5.5.1.4.  Stopping  5.5.1.4.1.   Always stop towing vehicle by applying brakes gradually and smoothly.  Do this whether or not the trailer is loaded.  5.5.1.5.  Parking.  5.5.1.5.1.   When  towing  vehicle  and  trailer  are  left  unattended,  set  towing  vehicle parking brakes, turn off engine and set wheel chocks.  5.5.1.5.2.   Apply handbrakes.  5.5.2.

Walk-Around Inspecting 7.  Final Air Brake Check   o o o o   o o o o  o o o o o  o Procedure  Check manual slack adjusters on S-cam brakes.  Note:  Vehicles with automatic slack adjustors still must be checked. Park on level ground and chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes so the operator can move the slack adjusters. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that it can be reached. Check slack adjuster, more than 1-inch indicates adjustments required (vehicles with too much brake slack can be very hard to stop).  Adjust it or have it adjusted. Check brake drums (or discs), linings, and hoses. Test low pressure warning signal. Shut the engine off when the vehicle has enough air pressure so that the low pressure warning signal is not on. Turn the electrical power on. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce air tank pressure. Low air pressure warning signal should come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank with lowest pressure. Check that the spring brakes come on automatically. Chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes when enough air pressure is built up. Shut the engine off. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce the air tank pressure. "Parking brake" knob should pop out when the air pressure falls to the manufacturer's specification. Check rate of air pressure buildup Refer to manufacturer’s recommendation for average buildup time.   o If not within recommended time, the air pressure may drop too low during driving operations. Test air leakage rate.  o  With a fully-charged air system (typically 125 o o o o  o o o o       psi). Turn-off the engine. Release the service brake and time the air pressure drop. The loss rate should be less than 2 psi in one minute for single vehicles. Not less than 3 psi in 1 minute for combination vehicles. Then apply 90 psi or more with the brake pedal. After the initial pressure drop, if the air pressure falls more than 3 psi in 1 minute for single vehicles. Not more than 4 psi for combination vehicles. Engine idling, step on and off brake to reduce air tank pressure. Test parking brake:  Stop the vehicle; put the parking brake on; gently pull against it in low gear to determine if parking brake will hold. Test service brakes. Wait for normal air pressure. Release the parking brake. Move the vehicle forward slowly (about 5 mph). Apply the brakes firmly using the brake pedal. Note any vehicle "pulling" to one side, unusual feel, or delayed stopping action.
