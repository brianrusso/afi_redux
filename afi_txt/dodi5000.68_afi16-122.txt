PURPOSE. This Instruction establishes policy and assigns responsibilities regarding thepreparation of DoD personnel and operational planning for, as well as the conduct of, SFA across the Department of Defense in accordance with the authority in DoD Directive (DoDD) 5111.1 (Reference (a)); Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum (Reference (b)); titles 10 and 22 of the United States Code (References (c) and (d)), the guidance in Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum (Reference (e)), and DoDDs 5132.03 and 3000.07 (References (f) and (g)) as they pertain to SFA (see Glossary for definitions). 2. APPLICABILITY. This Instruction applies to OSD, the Military Departments (including theCoast Guard at all times, including when it is a Service in the Department of Homeland Security by agreement with that Department), the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, the Defense Agencies, the DoD Field Activities, and all other organizational entities within the Department of Defense (hereafter referred to collectively as the “DoD Components”). 3. DEFINITIONS. See Glossary.4. POLICY. It is DoD policy that:a. The Department of Defense shall develop and  maintain the capability within DoD generalpurpose forces  (GPF), special operations  forces  (SOF),  and the  civilian expeditionary workforce (CEW) to conduct SFA activities in support of U.S. policy and in coordination with the relevant U.S. Government (USG) departments or agencies (hereafter referred to collectively as “USG agencies”). b. SFA shall encompass DoD efforts to support the professionalization and the sustainabledevelopment of the capacity and capability of the foreign security forces and supporting institutions of host countries, as well as international and regional security organizations. SFA DODI 5000.68_AFI16-122   10 February 2012     3 can occur across the range of military operations and spectrum of conflict as well as during all phases of military operations. These efforts shall be conducted with, through, and by foreign security forces. c. SFA activities shall be conducted primarily to assist host countries to defend againstinternal and transnational threats to stability. However, the Department of Defense may also conduct SFA to assist host countries to defend effectively against external threats; contribute to coalition operations; or organize, train, equip, and advise another country’s security forces or supporting institutions. d. SFA activities must directly increase the capacity or capability of a foreign security force ortheir supporting institutions. The term “directly” is context-specific and serves to emphasize that the clear and express intent of a SFA activity is the improvement of the capacity or capability of a foreign security force or its supporting institutions. e. SFA contributes to the DoD role in USG security sector reform (SSR) initiatives.f. SFA is a subset of DoD overall security cooperation (SC) initiatives. Other SC activities,such as bilateral meetings or civil affairs activities dedicated to the non-security sector, provide valuable engagement opportunities between the United States and its partners, but fall outside the scope of SFA. g. Security assistance programs are critical tools to fund and enable SFA activities, whichcontribute to a host country’s defense. h. The portion of SFA oriented towards supporting a host country’s efforts to counter threatsfrom subversion, lawlessness, and insurgency, is a subset of foreign internal defense. i. SFA activities shall be prioritized using factors such as U.S. interests in the region, thewillingness and ability of partner nations to absorb U.S. assistance, and the level of risk for partner nations to achieve their goals without U.S. assistance. j. The Department of Defense shall develop and maintain capabilities to:(1)   Organize, train, equip, and advise foreign military forces. (2)   Support the development of the capability and capacity of host-country defense institutions and ministries. (3)   Conduct SFA across all domains – air, land, maritime, and cyberspace – in both permissive and contested environments, under steady-state or surge conditions. k. If required to support the development of the capability and capacity of non-defense ministrysecurity forces and their supporting institutions, and to the extent authorized by law, the Department of Defense shall be prepared to apply the requisite task-organized capabilities to: (1)   Support and coordinate with other USG agencies that are leading USG efforts to support the development of the capability and capacity of non-defense ministry security forces and their supporting institutions. DODI 5000.68_AFI16-122   10 February 2012      4 (2)   Advise and support  the training of foreign paramilitary security forces  – such as border and coastal control  forces, counterterrorist  forces,  and paramilitary or special police forces  – at all levels, in conjunction with other USG agencies. (3)   Support the training of host-country civil police in individual and collective tasks in contested environments when other USG-agencies’ trainers and advisors are unable to do so. Coordinate the transition of responsibilities for such training and advisory duties to other USG agencies as the security environment allows. l. The Department of Defense shall conduct SFA activities with the appropriate combinations ofSOF, GPF, CEW personnel (in accordance with DoDD 1404.10 (Reference (h))), and contract personnel that are collectively capable of executing all missions and activities required under these conditions: (1)   Politically sensitive environments where an overt U.S. presence is unacceptable to the host-country government. (2)   Environments where a limited, overt U.S. presence is acceptable to the host-country government. (3)   Environments where a large-scale U.S. presence is considered necessary and acceptable by the host-country government. 5. RESPONSIBILITIES. See Enclosure 2.6. RELEASABILITY. UNLIMITED.
