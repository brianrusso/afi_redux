Air Force bands use music to honor and encourage Airmen wherever they serve, whether on the front lines or at their home station.  Bands also engage a wide variety of audiences on behalf of the Air  Force  and the  United States.  Whether building public trust and support  throughout  the  United  States,  or  overcoming  a  wide  variety  of  social  and  cultural challenges to reach strategic objectives overseas, bands use the effects of music to facilitate Air Force communication around the world.  IAW AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, paragraph 10.4.2., the USAF Band badge is awarded as follows:  Officers:  Wear the basic badge after being deemed qualified through a competitive band officer selection board, and after being commissioned as a band officer in the Air  Force.    Wear  the  senior  badge  after  7  years  in  the  specialty  and  the  master badge after 15 years in the specialty.           CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN BANDS – AFSC 35BX Table of Contents   PART I  Preface …………………….............................................................................................................5  Abbreviations and Terms Explained ................................................................................................7  Section A - General Information .....................................................................................................8 Purpose of the CFETP  Uses of the CFETP  Coordination and Approval of the CFETP    Section B - Career Progression and Information  ............................................................................8       Entry Level (1) Qualified Level (3) Staff Level (4) Specialty Description  Skill / Career Progression     Training Decisions Career Development Career Field Path  Entry Level (1) Qualified Level (3) Staff Level (4)   Section C – 35B Proficiency Training Requirements  ...................................................................12     Section D - Resource Constraints  .................................................................................................13  PART II  Section A – Band Officer Course Training Standards  ..................................................................14 Purpose Documentation Course Training Standards Training Reference Bibliography     Section B – Training Course Index  ...............................................................................................36       Purpose Defense Information School (DINFOS) Courses The USAF Band – Ceremonial Band Officer Training Course Other Training Courses 3 Section C – Support Materials  ......................................................................................................37 There are currently no support material requirements.

This  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)  is  a  comprehensive  education and  training  document  that  identifies  life-cycle  education  and  training  requirements, training support resources, and minimum requirements for active duty band officers. 1.1. This plan is designed to prepare and equip Air Force active duty officers to serve as Flight Commanders  (FC)  in  an  Air  Force  band.    It  is  also  intended  to  give  officers  the  leadership experience, knowledge and technical expertise necessary to successfully  lead  Air  Force musical organizations.  Band commanders (CC) will serve as primary trainers and have final authority over the implementation and certification of the training plan.  1.2. In addition to the CC, band Managers and Superintendents will act as trainers and mentors.  The managers will work closely with the various shop and ensemble NCOICs to train the FC, and document the training in the training plan.  1.3. This plan gives the FC practical opportunities and tools to understand, rehearse, participate in, and manage all areas of a band.  The purpose of training is not to provide expertise in all specific duty functions, but to give the FC a comprehensive understanding of the operation of an Air Force band that can then be used as a broad base of information to make sound decisions.  Regardless of the  nature  of  the  tasks  or  skills  being  learned,  the  FC  must  approach  their  mastery  from  a command perspective.  1.4. The training will be both hands-on and study oriented, building knowledge and experience by researching and reading available guidance and other resources, as well as by a variety of practical applications.  The FC will personally perform specific tasks or assignments and will also work in each additional duty area.  As directed by the CC, additional-duty NCOICs will involve the FC in tasks in a manner that allows them to follow each task from inception to completion.  1.5. The  overarching  goals  are  to  develop  a  thorough  working  knowledge  of  how  an  Air  Force band  operates,  provide  a  foundational  understanding  of  its  mission,  and  provide  the  basic  tools required for accomplishing that mission as an officer.  The FC will also become better prepared as a key spokesperson for their band and the United States Air Force.  2. The CFETP consists of two parts: 2.1. Part  I  identifies  information  necessary  for  overall  management  of  the  specialty.  Section  A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career path; Section C associates the Entry, Qualified, and Staff  Levels  with  specialty  qualifications  (knowledge,  education,  training,  and  experience);  and Section D addresses resource constraints.   2.2. Part II provides options available to meet education and training needs.  Section A identifies the Course Training Standard (CTS), Training Requirements for certification as a Band officer and PART I  Preface     5 to  acquire  35B3,  and  technical  references  to  support  training.    Section  B  identifies  additional courses used for Air Force band officer development.  Section C, Support Materials, and Section D,  MAJCOM-Unique  Requirements,  are  not  used.    Section  E  offers  information  on  additional references, suggested readings, and professional societies. 3. Using the guidance provided in this CFETP will ensure individuals in the band officer specialty receive  effective  and  efficient  training  at  the  appropriate  points  in  their  career.    This  plan  will enable those in the band career field to train today’s 35B officers to become innovative, strategic leaders with the agility to face future challenges confidently.   4.

This  CFETP  was  designed  by  the  AFCFM  and  the  Chief  of  Air  Force Bands Division with the assistance of commissioned and enlisted training experts from around the career field, and encompasses the entire spectrum of training requirements for the 35B career field.  3.1. Initial Skills.  Initial and entry level skills are assessed in a competitive band officer selection board.  For entry into this specialty, certification by the Air Force Chief of Music is required.  3.2. Upgrade Requirements.  For award of AFSC 35B3, completion of the CFETP core tasks and the  35P1  specialty  code,  and  a  minimum  of  12  months  of  experience  in  band  assignments  is mandatory.    Upgrade  training  must  be  completed  within  36  months  of  graduation  from  a 9 commissioning source.  NOTE:  Air National Guard band officers follow a separate training plan.  (There are no Reserve officer positions in Air Force bands.)  3.3. Staff.    AFSC  35B4  is  used  to  designate  manpower  positions  in  organizations  above  Wing level, regardless of grade.  4. Career  Field  Path.    Air  Force  leaders  must  fully  understand  the  operational  Air  Force, demonstrate  breadth  and  depth  in  their  specialty,  and  prove  their  ability  to  lead  and  think  of themselves as Airmen first, specialists second.  Successful senior leaders build their careers one assignment at a time, always keeping in mind that their current assignment is their most important for career progression.  4.1. Professional Development.  Deliberate professional development is essential to produce AF leaders with relevant technical expertise, diverse experience, an ability to apply the tenets of air, space  and  cyberspace  power,  and  a  sterling  record  of  performance.    Professional  development requires:   4.1.1. Diversity  of  assignments  (i.e.,  CONUS,  OCONUS,  Premier  Band,  Air  Staff  and  career broadening opportunities).  4.1.2. Completing  professional  military  education,  supplemental  training  and  education,  and  a relevant advanced academic degree to be competitive for O-6.  4.1.3. Deploying to combat/contingency operations.  4.1.4. Mentorship  by  commanders,  supervisors,  and  senior  AF  leaders  inside  and  outside  of  the career field.  Officers should review career goals with their commander or senior leaders at least annually and discuss career progression using the 35BX career planning diagrams shown in Figure 1.  4.2. The  career  planning  diagram  (Figure  1)  graphically  displays  the  types  of  opportunities available  at  different  times  in  an  individual’s  career.  The  diagram  is  only  a  guide;  it  does  not represent  every  career  path  or  opportunity,  and  there  is  no  specific  career  path  that  guarantees success. Early on, individuals should develop a solid technical and operational experience base and continually focus on gaining depth and breadth as their careers progress. The diagram should be used as a planning guide by senior band / PA leaders, commanders, supervisors, and individuals in conjunction with other planning tools to include AFI 36-2110, Assignments, and PA Development Team vectors. While an individual’s career path may be influenced by personal aspirations, it is ultimately driven by the needs of the Air Force.           10 IPZ Board20 yearsIPZ Board14 yearsIPZ Board9 yrsIPZ Board4 yrs                                      35B Career Planning DiagramPremier Band CommanderJB A-Bolling(O-6)SAF/PABChief, AF Bands DivisionPentagon (O-5)Band CommanderPeterson, Ramstein (O-5)Premier Band Operations OfficerJB Anacostia-Bolling (O-5)Band CommanderYokota, JB Langley-Eustis, Scott, JBSA-Lackland, Travis (O-4)SAF/PAY (Engagements Division)Pentagon (O-3)Band Operations OfficerRamstein (O-3)Premier Band Flight CommanderJB Anacostia-Bolling (O-3)Band Operations OfficerPeterson (O-3)Premier Band Flight CommanderJB Anacostia-Bolling (O-2)Band Flight CommanderJB Langley-Eustis, Scott, JBSA-Lackland, TravisSenior Developmental EdAF/Army/Navy/National War CollegeProfessional EdJSPACIntermediate Developmental EdACSC/NPS, Sq/CC’s Course,JIPACDevelopmental EdSOSProfessional EdPAQC, IOFAC, Ceremonial Training As of Jan 20152 Figure 1.  35B Officer Career Planning Diagram  11 Section C – Proficiency Training Requirements  1.
