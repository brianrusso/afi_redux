Meet mission requirements.  5.2.2.2.4.2.  Demonstrates a qualified trained professional operator. 5.2.3.  Cable reel design and specifications.  Cable reels vary in size, shape and specifications, determined by make and model; it is imperative to know the specifications of the cable reel that  will  be  operated  before  use.    Specification  information  should  be  used  together  to determine the proper use and necessary precautions to take prior to operating the cable reel.  This information is best found in the appropriate TO or Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual for the specific cable reel being operated.  5.2.4.  Major systems and components:  5.2.4.1.  Hydraulic system.  5.2.4.1.1.   The hydraulic oil is the life blood of the system.  Its proper selection and care is important to provide the most efficient operation and the longest life from each of the hydraulic components.  The hydraulic oil not only transmits the energy required to operate these systems from the pump to the cylinders and motors but also provides for the much needed lubrication and cooling of the components.  5.2.4.1.2.   The major hydraulic system components include:  5.2.4.1.2.1.  Reservoir.  5.2.4.1.2.1.1.  The reservoir has a capacity of 35 gallons for the 93 Series and 45 gallons for the 96 Series and is equipped with fill, drain, return and outlet  Note:  Whenever this valve has been cut off, make sure it is fully opened prior to engaging power take-off (PTO) or damage to pump will occur.  5.2.4.1.2.2.  Cylinders.             connections,  oil  level  indicator,  cut  off  valve  on  outlet,  and  internal  outlet strainer with magnetic separator.  5.2.4.1.2.1.2.  Whenever it is necessary to change a component that is located below the top of the reservoir, the cut off valve on the outlet should be closed to prevent loss of oil from the reservoir. 5.2.4.1.2.3.  Pump. 5.2.4.1.2.4.  Motors. 5.2.4.1.2.5. Directional control valves. 5.2.4.1.2.6.  Return line filter, 5.2.4.1.2.7. Relief valves. 5.2.4.1.2.8.  Plumbing. 5.2.4.1.2.9.  Flow dividers. 5.2.4.1.2.10. Oil. 5.2.4.1.3.   It  is  often  said  that  oil  does  not  wear  out  and  can  be  left  in  a  machine indefinitely provided the filters are changed regularly.  Good filtration will definitely prolong  the  useful  life  of  hydraulic  oil;  however,  its  lubrication  characteristics  are diminished as it becomes diluted by condensation and the formation of acids of other non-filterable contaminants which form during normal use of the equipment. 5.2.4.1.4.   The ALTER hydraulic line construction unit hydraulic system is equipped with one of the most complete filtration systems on any piece of mobile equipment.  Filtration  starts  when  the  oil  reservoir  is  filled  as  the  reservoir  is  equipped  with  a strainer basket to prevent large particles from entering the reservoir during filling. 5.2.4.1.4.1.  The reservoir cap has a 40 micron element to filter air which enters and leaves the reservoir as the oil level changes.  As the oil leaves the reservoir it passes through a magnetic separator.  5.2.4.1.4.2.  This unit has a screen to prevent large particles from getting to the pump and a series of magnets in the flow path to attract and accumulate any iron or steel particles which are suspended in the oil. 5.2.4.1.5.   Before the oil returns to the reservoir, it passes through the return line filter which has a 10 micron element.  This prevents contaminants which the oil picked up from getting into the reservoir.  The filter has a bypass valve which allows the oil to bypass the filter should the pressure drop across it exceed 25 pounds per square inch (psi).  When this occurs, oil is not being filtered and the element should be replaced.  5.2.4.2.  Reel lifter description.       5.2.4.2.1.   The model RL9 Reel Lifter is a hydraulically operated unit with independent arms and two sets of lifting hands on each arm.   5.2.4.2.1.1.  The lifting arms work independently of each other to facilitate level operation of the reels while the vehicle is parked or driven on uneven surfaces with slopes as much as 15 degrees.  It is designed to handle cable reels up to 60" wide in either set of hands.  5.2.4.2.1.2.  The outer hands will lift a reel up to 108” in diameter and weighing up to 6000lbs on a 3” diameter spindle bar. 5.2.4.2.1.3.  The  inner  hands  will  lift  a  reel  up  to  96”  diameter  weighing  up  to 8000lbs on a 2 1/2” diameter spindle bar and an 84” diameter reel weighing 400lbs on a 1 1/2 diameter spindle bar.  The lifter arms will position and hold the reel in desired position within the rotating limits of the arms.  5.2.4.2.2.   The major parts and components of the reel lifter are the:  Arm assembly, mainframe welding, two double acting hydraulic cylinders, rotating linkage and reel carrying bar.  5.2.4.3.  Reel driver description.  5.2.4.3.1.   The reel driver is a hydraulically operated unit designed for use with reels up to 46"/60” wide for 88-90, 93-96 Models (Western Electric reel #420).  It may be used for:  5.2.4.3.1.1.  Pulling in or paying out cable.  The driver is designed for light pulling in range of 1000 to 2000 pounds tension and is not primarily designed to pull cable through conduit.  5.2.4.3.1.2.  Rewinding cable from one reel to another. 5.2.4.3.1.3.  Reel brake. 5.2.4.3.1.4.  Capstan or collapsible reel operations when equipped with extended shaft. 5.2.4.3.2.   The major parts of the reel driver are the:  Hydraulic drive motor, motor mounting base, drive train, driver shaft, shaft bearings and rollers.  5.2.4.3.3.   The motor mounting base is mounted to the underside of lifter mainframe and is adjustable to maintain proper tension of drive train chain.  The shaft bearing mounting supports are an integral part of the lifter mainframe.  5.2.4.4.  Alter model BW2725LWES continuous duty winch description.  5.2.4.4.1.   The  alter  model  BW2725LWES  continuous  duty  winch  is  designed  for underground and overhead construction and maintenance of telephone industry cables.  5.2.4.4.2.   This  winch  is  a  continuous  duty-level  wind  unit  designed  for  sustained maximum pull conditions.  Heat generation is minimized by the use of a planetary gear reduction drive assembly. 5.2.4.4.3.   There is a clutch and drag brake located on the driver side of the unit.  The winch clutch consists of a clutch plate, shift forks, and air cylinder. 5.2.4.4.3.1.  The clutch plate is spring loaded to the engaged position.  When air is supplied to the retract side of the air cylinder, the clutch plate is disengaged from the drive pins on the winch drum flange.  The drag brake is simultaneously engaged when the clutch is disengaged.  5.2.4.4.3.2.  The extended shaft, which is attached to the end of the winch drum shaft, can be operated with the clutch disengaged, 5.2.4.4.4.   The unit has a load holding drum shaft brake which prevents the drum shaft from turning when the unit is not being driven.  Upon application of hydraulic pressure to the winch drive motor the drum shaft brake is released.  Note:  Caution – The drag brake is used to prevent overrunning of the winch drum only.  It is never to be used to hold the load.  Shifting of the clutch should be done only when drum rotation has stopped.  5.2.4.5.

Wire rope description.  5.2.4.6.1.   The Model BW2027LWES winch has the following rope storage capacity. See Table 5.2.  Table 5.2.  Model BW2027LWES Winch Rope Storage Capacity.  Rope Diameter Length Rear 7/16 in. Front 1/2 in. 3400 ft. 2500 ft.       5.2.4.6.2.   It is important to select the proper wire rope in terms of diameter, number of strands, number of wires per strand, and type of center.  5.2.4.6.3.   Rope care. 5.2.4.6.3.1.  Care should be taken  when installing the wire rope onto the winch drum to prevent kicking.  The rope should always be under tension when spooling onto the drum.  This will prevent loose coils.  5.2.4.6.3.2.  Always spool the rope onto the drum with the natural bend in the same direction as it was on the reel. 5.2.4.6.3.3.  When  not  in  operation,  the  wire  rope  should  be  stored  under  light tension to prevent unwinding. 5.2.4.6.3.4.  Wire rope should be lubricated periodically with a good quality wire rope lubricant to maximize the rope’s useful life.  5.2.4.7.  Alternator description.  5.2.4.7.1.   The  watts  Model  1BHMF-30  is  a  hydraulic  drive  alternator  capable  of producing  3000  (25  amps)  of  power  at  60  cycles  and  120  VAC.    It  is  self-excited (requires not power from battery).  Is has the ability of operating equipment requiring 25 amps/120 VAC or 12 amps/240 VAC of starting current.  It will operate such devices as lights, heaters, tools and other accessories.  5.2.4.7.2.   Some accessories powered by induction type motors may not operate from this alternator even though the motor nameplate current draw is well below the amp capacity because of the high starting current requirements of three to five times the running current. 5.2.4.7.3.   The alternator is permanently plumbed into the truck hydraulic circuit and wired to an electric outlet.  This outlet is a double outlet and located at control station at the rear of the truck. 5.2.4.8.  Hydraulic ventilating fan description.  5.2.4.8.1.

The fan is equipped with a 30,000 British thermal unit (BTU) heater.  Water from the vehicle's engine cooling system is pumped through the heater using a 12 volt high temperature water pump.  The ventilating air temperature can be infinitely varied from ambient to hot.  5.3. Vehicle Inspection.    5.3.1.  Types of vehicle inspection.  Note:  If discrepancies are found they must be reported to Vehicle  Control  Officer/Vehicle  Control  Non  Commissioned  Officer  (VCO/VCNCO),  the supervisor, and/or vehicle maintenance:  5.3.2.  Preventative  maintenance.    The  operator  should  be  familiar  with  preventative maintenance and be able to demonstrate preventative maintenance of the following items:  5.3.2.1.  Care of the hydraulic line construction unit.  5.3.2.1.1.   Shock loads and overloads should be avoided as these conditions can be hazardous to the machine and to people around the unit.  Start and stop all operations smoothly.  Note:  Do NOT use this unit for jobs beyond its capacity. 5.3.2.1.2. .  Any unusual noises observed during operation should be reported so that the cause can be determined and the situation corrected if necessary.  A noisy pump should not be run until the cause is corrected.  Low oil levels, loose connections or leaks in the inlet lines, a partially closed inlet line valve, worn shaft seals or other pump parts, aeration of the reservoir fluid, excessive pump speeds, and cold or thick hydraulic oil are all possible causes for excessive pump noise. 5.3.2.1.3.   Squeaking or jerky motion of moving parts is an indication that lubrication is needed and should be done as outlined in the maintenance section.  Any sign of lubricant leaking from the winch should be reported and corrected as soon as possible. 5.3.2.1.4.   Any loosening of fasteners or adjustments which appear to be needed should be corrected before they cause more serious problems.      5.3.2.1.5.

The frequency with which the filter should be serviced will vary depending upon the conditions under which the unit is operated.  5.3.3.9.7.2.  Subsequent  filter  changes  should  be  done  after  each  100  hours  of machine operation and anytime the pressure drop across the filter is in excess of 25 psi.  The filter has a gauge port on top of its housing for installation of a gauge. 5.3.3.9.8.   Draining and refilling the hydraulic reservoir.  It is recommended that the hydraulic reservoir be drained and refilled with new oil after each 500 hours of machine operation.  5.3.3.9.8.1.  In climates where there is a wide variation of operating temperatures between summer and winter months, an oil change to the appropriate oil weight is recommended  each  spring  and  fall.    The  filter  cartridge  in  the  return  line  filter should be replaced at each oil change. 5.3.3.9.9.   In the event that the hydraulic system becomes heavily contaminated with metallic  particles  due  to  a  motor,  pump,  or  other  component  failure,  the  following action  should  be  taken  to  prevent  premature  failure  of  the  replacement  component installed and damage to other components in the system: 5.3.3.9.9.1.  Drain the oil reservoir completely.  5.3.3.9.9.2.  Wipe the magnets of the magnetic separator clean using a lint free rag. 5.3.3.9.9.3.  Use a "short fill" (reservoir half full) of clean hydraulic oil to flush the contaminated  oil  from  all  cylinders  and  prevent  cavitation  during  this  flushing process. 5.3.3.9.9.4.  Drain the reservoir completely again. 5.3.3.9.9.5.  Chain the return line filter cartridge. 5.3.3.9.9.6.  Refill the oil reservoir to “full” level with clean hydraulic oil. Note:  Caution – Do NOT add kerosene or other “thinners” to hydraulic oil.  These fluids will cause swelling and rapid deterioration of O-rings and other seals in the hydraulic system. 5.3.3.9.9.7.  Allow the new oil to circulate through the system for several minute before operating the unit. 5.3.3.9.10.  If there is any question as to whether or not the hydraulic oil needs to be changed,  some  oil  may  be  drained  from  the  bottom  of  the  reservoir  into  a  glass container and inspected for the following indications of oil deterioration:  5.3.3.9.10.1. Dark or cloudy appearance.  5.3.3.9.10.2. A rancid or burned odor. 5.3.3.9.10.3. Foreign particles or other visible contaminants. 5.3.3.9.10.4. A loss of viscosity. 5.3.3.9.10.5. A separation of water or other fluids from the oil.            Note:  An oil change is recommended if the sample exhibits these characteristics.  A comparison with a sample of new oil may be used to determine the degree of deterioration.  5.3.3.10.   Reel lifter:  5.3.3.10.1.  Visually inspect the lifter for breaks, cracks, fractures, bent or twisted parts, loose or missing components and fasteners, and other defects.  Make necessary repairs or replacements to return unit to proper configuration.  5.3.3.10.2.  Operate  lifter  through  its  full  range  and  check  for  correct  operation, linkage, arms and/or cylinders for interferences, and pins (for retention and fit).  5.3.3.10.3.  If the lifter arms drift under the load, the counterbalance holding valve is most likely contaminated.  Cycling the unit may flush contaminants; however, if this does not correct the drifting, the counterbalance valve cartridge should be changed. Note:  Caution – Do NOT attempt to adjust the valve to correct drift.  Replace the valve.   5.3.3.11.   Reel driver:          5.3.3.11.1.  Visually  inspect  the  driver  for  breaks,  cracks,  fractures,  bent  or  twisted parts, loose or missing components and fasteners, and other defects.  Make necessary repairs or replacements to return driver to proper configuration.  5.3.3.11.2.  Check driver chain for condition and tension.  If chain requires adjustment, loosen driver motor mounting bracket bolts (2) and reposition motor to obtain desired chain tension, then re-tighten bolts. 5.3.3.11.3.  Check driver rollers for condition.  Replace if badly worn. 5.3.3.11.4.  Lubrication.  Lubricate the driver as indicated in the operator’s manual.  5.3.3.12.
