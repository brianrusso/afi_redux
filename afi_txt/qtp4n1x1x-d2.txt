This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make a training aid available that will assistOtolaryngology Surgical Technicians to develop technical skills essential to performing specialized tasks. The tasks are broken down into teachable elements that help the trainer guide the trainee into becoming proficient with the task.  The QTP will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for task certification. 2. As a trainer, go through each module (lesson) and identify which QTP tasks are appropriate for thetrainee’s duty position, and then determine the order in which you want the trainee to learn about each subject area.  Direct the trainee to review the training references to better understand the objective of each module.  Go through the steps in the task performance with the trainee and allow for enough time to learn each step; some objectives may take more time than others.  Remember, the objective of the QTP is to ensure the trainee can perform each task thoroughly.  When the trainee receives enough training and is ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation instructions.  Use the performance checklist as       you evaluate each objective.  If the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document appropriately in the individual’s training record.  If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas n e e d i n g  more training until the objective is met.  Conduct a feedback with the trainee on each module. After  the trainer has ensured and documented that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, a certifier       should evaluate the trainee. 3. The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that willmeet Air Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP).  We value your expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have suggestions for its improvement, or if you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP, please let us know about them.  The subject-matter-expert for writing and developing this QTP was: MSgt Katrina M.

Fundamentals of Nursing. Concepts, Process,   and Practice 5th ed , The Addison- Wesley Publication,    1995 Sterile gloves Forceps and small suture scissors Gauze Steri-strips Drape Antiseptic cleaner Dressing In a clinical setting, perform suture removal. There are various methods of suturing. Skin sutures can be broadly categorized as either interrupted (each stitch is tied and knotted separately) or continuous (one thread runs in a series of stitches and is tied only at the beginning and at the end of the run). Ensure trainee is familiar with each technique. EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS: 1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.2. Since this task involves direct patient care, ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent riskfactors, and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and correct the trainee if performance may compromise patient safety. Ensure the trainee dons all personal protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards/precautions. 3. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task with 100% accuracy, without assistance.4. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.5. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should bedocumented in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation should be documented using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using an approved substitute record. 1 Volume D2 Module 1 SAT UNSAT PERFORMING BASIC NURSING CARE PERFORMANCE CHECKLIST SUTURE REMOVAL PREPARATORY PHASE 1.
