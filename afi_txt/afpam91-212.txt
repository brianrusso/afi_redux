General Background:  1.1.1.  Aircraft collisions with birds and other wildlife annually cause millions of dollars in aircraftdamage and may result in loss of aircraft and aircrews. However, procedures to reduce these losses areavailable. Reduction of strike hazards may be divided into four categories: Awareness, Control,Avoidance and Aircraft design. Wildlife strike hazards to aircrew and aircraft may be significantlyreduced using a combination of the methods listed above. This may result in substantial savings of AirForce resources. 1.1.2.  The Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Team was formed to coordinate efforts in allareas. The BASH Team assists Air Force organizations worldwide to reduce the risk of bird strikesand collisions with other animals, such as deer. The BASH Team is located at Headquarters Air ForceSafety Center (HQ AFSC/SEFW; 9700 G Avenue SE, Suite 266; Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5670).More information about the BASH Team and related topics can be found at the following website:http://safety.kirtland.af.mil/afsc/bash/home.html 1.2.  Basics for a Program:  1.2.1.  Local conditions that enhance the potential for wildlife/aircraft strikes vary at each installation.Birds may flock to airfields or cause hazards en route; hazards may be seasonal or year round. Wild-life activity varies as local conditions change from crop selection, land use choices such as a landfilloperation, or creation of a wildlife refuge. Base-level personnel must remain vigilant of such attracta-nts and be aware of proper wildlife control techniques. Installations experiencing these problemsshould first contact their respective MAJCOM for assistance. The base may also contact the jurisdic-tional agency for proper coordination to assure compliance with state or federal regulations. Whereappropriate, AFSC/SEFW may provide additional assistance to resolve or reduce these potential haz-ards. The contacts mentioned above may suggest proven methods for wildlife dispersal, avoidanceprocedures, or recommend land management techniques that discourage wildlife activity from the air-field. 1.2.2.  Required time and effort necessary to maintain a safe airdrome will depend upon the severityof the wildlife strike hazard and how well base personnel are prepared to reduce these hazards. Thekey to a successful BASH reduction program is participation by well-trained individuals assigned spe-cific tasks. Wildlife strikes can never be eliminated; but, an aggressive, well-planned program devel-oped on the basis of wildlife habits, the environment, and the base mission may limit the potential forthese strikes to occur. The following are guidelines for BASH reduction programs. 1.3.  Developing a Program:  1.3.1.  Bird/Wildlife Hazard Reduction Plans. A well written, workable BASH plan is the key toreducing strike hazards and ensures continuity of knowledge with personnel turnover. If needed, asample BASH plan may be obtained from MAJCOM Flight Safety offices. Plans should be tailored tomeet the specific hazards encountered locally. Integrate all habitat modification procedures makingsure natural resource plans are compatible with base BASH program plans. As a minimum this planshould: inform new personnel of local hazards; identify local conditions on the airfield attractive toAFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 20045wildlife and cite measures to reduce these attractions (e.g., long grass, insect reduction, water drain-age); outline bird dispersal procedures and OPR; and specify base bird watch condition codes (seeAttachment 1), location where daily code will be displayed, implementation procedures, authoriza-tion for declaring codes and flight operations under specified bird watch condition codes. 1.3.2.  Bird Hazard Working Group (BHWG). The BHWG normally consists of representatives fromflight safety, airfield management, base operations, air traffic control, civil engineering, aircraft main-tenance, public affairs, and base legal. The base Natural Resource Manager and base Wildlife Biolo-gist should also attend. Other representatives such as the golf course manager, munitions or civilianoperations personnel may be included based on BHWG issues. The group's purpose is to assist thesafety office in drafting and implementing the Bird/Wildlife Hazard Reduction Plan. Meetings areheld IAW AFI 91-202, The Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, but may be called more frequentlyor as conditions dictate. BHWG meeting topics should include but are not limited to: USAF reportedwildlife mishaps and incidents; USAF BASH Team information updates; locally observed/reportedwildlife activity, to include LL ranges/routes, airfield inspections/surveys, recovered wildlife remains,wildlife strikes; local wildlife habitat management/modifications, to include dispersal/depredationactivity, environmental/land management activity, land uses (landfills, agriculture crop seasons);BASH-related budgeting issues; annual bird migrations; local BASH plan procedures and responsibil-ities, to include observed effectiveness/deficiencies; BASH awareness training/education, to includeBWC code definitions and communications; flying schedule and wildlife activity conflicts; BASHself-inspection checklist; status of bird dispersal supplies; and/or a review of FliP documents for wild-life advisories (Phase I / II designations). 1.3.3.  Base Self-Inspection Checklist. A BASH self-inspection checklist is a useful tool in identifyingdeficiencies in BASH reduction plans. A sample checklist is provided as Attachment 2. 1.4.  Documenting Bird Hazards:  1.4.1.  Evaluating an airfield for wildlife hazards involves the identification of local wildlife activityperiods, species causing hazards, locations of favorable habitat, and documenting this informationinto daily activity surveys. When information is compiled over several seasons or years, to includenight and day surveys, development of a more effective wildlife hazard reduction program is possible.The wildlife surveys should include: date and time; weather conditions; wildlife species of concern;favorable habitat locations on the airfield; wildlife movement corridors (soaring to and from roosts,feeding, etc.); wildlife activities (loafing, feeding, drinking, etc.); potential attractions; wildliferesponses to mowing; and/or land uses adjacent to base property (planting/plowing etc.). 1.4.2.  Documenting the local wildlife problem, technical assistance received, and the successes ofsolutions tried are essential parts of any wildlife hazard reduction program. Complete documentationis necessary to acquaint new personnel with the problem and may be required in any civil litigationregarding the resolution of a wildlife hazard. Documenting the use of non-lethal techniques may alsobe necessary to obtain permits to take lethal action, if needed, to resolve an extreme hazard. 1.4.3.  Photograph and summarize all hazardous situations wildlife create on base. For example, pic-tures of gulls loafing on the airfield accompanied by observations showing the birds using a nearbysanitary landfill can provide a strong case against future expansion of the landfill. Good documenta-tion gives credence to the problem and shows solutions are being considered. 6AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 20041.4.4.  Report all wildlife strikes, both damaging and non-damaging, on the Air Force Safety Auto-mated System (AFSAS) IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. The unit owning themishap aircraft’s flying hours must file the report. Additionally, any wildlife remains found on therunway and believed to have been involved in a strike must be documented via AFSAS. AFSAS canbe accessed online through the Air Force Safety Center’s homepage. This automated system will walkthe reporting individual through the necessary steps to file a report. 1.4.5.  Proper species identification of wildlife is an integral part of a BASH program. Feather remainsfrom every bird strike, if available, must be sent to the Smithsonian Institution National Museum ofNatural History for identification IAW AFI 91-204. AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 20047Chapter 2 AIRFIELD HAZARD CONTROL METHODS 2.1.  Introduction to Airfield Wildlife Control. Active and passive techniques can successfully reducethreats from hazardous wildlife populations. These techniques vary in cost and effectiveness dependingon the situation. Active control involves causing wildlife to disperse from an airfield to give short-termrelief from an immediate safety hazard. Passive techniques are more long-term in nature. They involvemanaging the airdrome to eliminate or reduce those conditions birds and other wildlife find attractive. 2.2.  Active Controls. Birds and other hazardous wildlife on runways, taxiways, or infields create apotential safety hazard and should be dispersed before flying operations can safely continue. Birds movequickly and unpredictably. Even when left in a "safe" portion of the airfield, they can move and create animmediate hazard. They may also act as decoys attracting additional birds. No single method of dispersalworks for all problems. Using a combination of different dispersal tools, also known as integrated pestmanagement, provides the best line of defense for immediate hazards. Pyrotechnics, bioacoustics, depre-dation, and other methods have been effective in dispersing wildlife from airfields. When used together,or in an alternating manner, these techniques remain more effective over a longer period. A depredationpermit is not required for non-lethal harassment of migratory birds on the airfield IAW 50 CFR 21.41Migratory Bird Depredation Permits. Authorized BASH equipment is listed in Attachment 5. NOTE: The key to active wildlife dispersal is perseverance. When birds or other wildlife are stronglyattracted to an airfield, several teams may be required to provide continual harassment. Usually, a singletrip around the airfield will not remove all the birds. 2.2.1.  Pyrotechnics. Pyrotechnics are noise-producing devices, which are effective in bird dispersal.Scare cartridges, a commercially available pyrotechnic, fired from a 12-gauge shotgun or an NJ-8Very Pistol [with a locally manufactured steel sleeve insert (technical order (TO) 11W2-9-2-31)], areauthorized. The 12-ga scare cartridge is an explosive charge fired 50 to 100 meters. At this distance, itdetonates producing a loud noise. Two types of 15mm scare cartridges are also authorized, bangersand screamers. The bangers do not have the range of the 12-ga cartridges but it and the screamer arefired from a 15mm launcher, which is not considered a weapon. The 15mm banger provides a loudreport, whereas the screamer makes a shrill whistle. Both are effective and inexpensive bird dispersaltools at moderate distances. Pyrotechnics can be used to flush and direct flocks of birds in a desireddirection. For example, if a flock of gulls is feeding near an active runway, a scare cartridge explodedbetween the birds and the runway will usually cause the birds to fly away from the source of the noiseand not pass over the runway. Close coordination with the control tower is essential so birds are notdirected into the path of arriving or departing aircraft. Always advise base security forces before pyro-technics are used. The base agency storing and using pyrotechnics must follow guidelines outlined inAFI 21-201, Management and Maintenance of Non-Nuclear Munitions and AFMAN 91-201, Explo-sives Safety Standards. Since harassment constitutes a "taking" for purposes of the Endangered Spe-cies Act, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) must be consulted prior to the use ofpyrotechnics if their use will affect any such Federal threatened/endangered species. 2.2.1.1.  Authorized BASH munitions fall into two categories, centrally managed and commer-cial-off-the- shelf (COTS). Centrally managed items are ordered through the base supply system.COTS items can be purchased using the IMPAC card. AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-widePurchase Card Program authorizes the purchase of BASH munitions with the IMPAC card (para-8AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 2004graph 2.4.7.). “To purchase COTS explosives and munitions, requesting unit will coordinate apackage, using an AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, through the installation MunitionsAccountable Supply Officer, Environmental, Safety, EOD, Transportation, and Legal agencies forGroup and Installation Commander approval” IAW AFI 21-201, paragraph 32.3.1. AFI 21-201,Figure 32.1 depicts the coordination process as: Figure 2.1.  COTS Coordination Process. 2.2.2.  Bioacoustics. This dispersal technique uses broadcasts of recorded bird distress calls. Depend-ing on the species, the calls may create differing responses; some will come to the calls while othersmay depart the area. For this reason, the sound source must be properly placed so the birds fly awayfrom the runway. As with pyrotechnics, if the use of bioacoustics will have an impact upon a federallylisted threatened or endangered species, the USFWS must be consulted prior to use. 2.2.2.1.  Broadcast distress calls may be used with a vehicle equipped with a sound system produc-ing 30 to 50 watts of distortion-free sound in 90 to 100 decibel (db) with a frequency responsebetween 12,000 and 14,000 Hertz (Hz). A speaker is mounted on the vehicle. The operator identi-AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 20049fies the birds to be dispersed and selects the appropriate distress call tape. The vehicle is driven asclose as possible to the birds. Depending on physical factors such as terrain, trees, and structureson the airfield, the distance from the problem birds will vary. Employ bioacoustics 100 to 200meters as the maximum distance from birds to achieve the desired results. The distress call is thenplayed for 15 to 20 seconds. If the birds have not moved within 20 seconds, play the call again. Ifthey have not moved by the third attempt, other methods are required. 2.2.2.1.1.  There are four important points to remember when using bioacoustics. 1) Try toidentify the bird species you wish to disperse and use that species’ distress call. However, avariety of calls may be tried to determine the most effective selection for a particular pest.Some bird species do not respond to distress calls. 2) Make sure the vehicle is stopped whenthe distress calls are played. Birds need to identify the source of the disturbance before theycan react. 3) Do not allow the distress calls to play indefinitely because birds can becomeaccustomed (habituate) to them. 4) The effectiveness of distress calls is dramatically increasedwhen combined with other frightening techniques, especially pyrotechnics. 2.2.2.2.  Distress calls have limited use in many situations. Not all birds are affected by bioacous-tics. Birds often react to the calls by flying toward the source, circling it, and gradually movingaway. This takes time and may create a momentary hazard. Combining bioacoustics with pyro-technics can best disperse these birds. The distress call is played to get the birds in the air, then,pyrotechnics are used to disperse them. Hazards to flying operations can be alleviated by usingthese techniques before flying begins or during breaks in flight activities. 2.2.2.3.  Gulls, starlings, blackbirds, and crows can be effectively dispersed with distress tapes.Occasionally, recorded distress calls of different bird species will frighten a variety of birds; how-ever, species-specific distress calls are the most effective. 2.2.2.4.  Tapes or digital recordings of distress calls are difficult to find and therefore bioacousticsmay be of limited usefulness. Distress calls are now being incorporated into multi-functional birdscare systems 2.2.3.  Depredation. Bioacoustics and pyrotechnics provide good wildlife control in most situations.Yet, some species may grow accustomed to these techniques, and a few individuals may have to betaken via lethal means to reinforce the idea that a significant danger exists. A federal depredation per-mit, available from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), is required before killing any pro-tected birds. The application for the depredation permit is a USFWS Form 3-200-13, Federal Fish andWildlife License/Permit Application Form, and must be accompanied by the information requested bythe USFWS information sheet 50 CFR 21.41. A copy of the permit must be carried whenever exercis-ing its authority. Birds may only be killed in conjunction with a continuing non-lethal control pro-gram. Unless otherwise directed, carcasses, nests, and eggs shall be completely destroyed orincinerated. No federally listed threatened or endangered species, Bald or Golden Eagles, or theirnests and/or eggs are authorized. European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), House Sparrows (Passerdomesticus), and Rock Doves/domestic pigeons (Columba livia) are not federally protected in theUnited States and require no federal depredation permit. When granted, the permit will specify thespecies, the numbers of birds that can be taken, and the technique to be used. NOTE: Anyone participating in the base depredation program should attend and receive certificationthrough a hunter's safety or gun handling safety course. Contact the base rod and gun club or MWR for10AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 2004information on base organized hunter safety programs, or contact the local game agency and their admin-istrator for hunter safety courses in the area. 2.2.3.1.  Airport Permits. The USFWS is adding an additional clause on depredation permits forairports in some regions. This clause would allow airports to kill, capture, or relocate up to ten(10) migratory bird species on an emergency basis. An emergency is defined as an immediate dan-ger to public safety and/or an immediate hazard to aircraft. Any emergency activity must bereported to the depredation permit issuing office within 24 hours. This emergency clause is onlyapproved in certain regions, so contact the depredation permit issuing office before taking anyactions. NOTE: Some states may require additional permits for the take of State protected species. These may becoordinated with the USFWS as well. Coordinate with the base environmental flight and legal officeswhen obtaining permits. 2.2.4.  Other Wildlife Control Methods. Other active control methods listed on the next page maybe effective. 2.2.4.1.  Propane Gas Cannons. These devices should be operated, especially at dawn and dusk,as birds come in to feed or roost. Cannons must be relocated frequently to avoid habituation prob-lems. Continuously operating cannons quickly leads to habituation, rendering the cannons ineffec-tive. These devices may be effective on gulls, blackbirds, waterfowl, pheasants, and other gamebirds when used in conjunction with other harassment techniques or depredation. 2.2.4.2.  Falconry. A falconry program is not limited to the use of falcons only but can incorpo-rate several species of birds of prey. Falcons trained for airfield bird dispersal may be effectivewhen used in combination with other frightening techniques. Deploying birds of prey usually dis-perses birds immediately from the airfield and these birds are likely to remain away from the air-field for longer periods. Birds of prey inherently scare other birds so there is little habituation ofthe “prey” to the threat. In adding this tool to your harassment arsenal, you also get the benefit ofthe bird handlers’ knowledge of birds and their behavior. However, there are limitations to fal-conry. A falconry program can be very expensive, labor intensive, and there is some potential forbird strikes with the falconry birds. Falcons can be flown only during daylight hours in goodweather, and they cannot be flown when molting or after feeding. In order to adequately cover allflying operations at an airfield, multiple handlers and birds will have to be employed, hence thehigh expense. Also, most birds of prey typically used in falconry programs are ineffective in dis-persing large waterfowl, particularly geese, and other birds of prey from an airfield. 2.2.4.3.  Dogs. The use of Border Collies or other breeds of dogs to disperse geese has been effec-tive under certain circumstances. A dog demands full-time attention, especially Border Collies,making it more advantageous to contract the services of a dog and its handler rather than purchas-ing a dog. While a dog may be very effective at dispersing geese from an airfield it may proveineffective at removing geese from bodies of water or other species of birds from the airfield,especially gulls. 2.2.4.4.  Radio Controlled Crafts. Use of radio controlled aircraft, dune buggies, or boats to dis-perse birds have shown significant results. The airplane can guide the birds in a flight path awayfrom the airfield and offers continued harassment while the birds are in flight. Radio controlledboats can harass birds on large ponds where pyrotechnics cannot reach out and touch the birds.AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 200411Cars can effectively disperse birds from grassy areas; particularly office buildings or housingwhere the use of pyrotechnics or gas cannons is not desirable. 2.2.4.5.  All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV). Use of all terrain vehicles in the airfield environment hasproven useful in dispersing birds and other wildlife from the aircraft operating area. Many air-fields have areas, which are difficult to navigate, even with 4x4 vehicles. The ATV can operate inany area to get the birds in the air and supplementing with pyrotechnics once airborne can furtherdisperse them. However, before operating an ATV, personnel must complete an ATV rider safetycourse IAW with AFI 91-207 which requires that ATV training will be acquired by a certified Spe-cialty Vehicle Institute of America (SVIA) before operating an ATV. 2.2.5.  Ineffective Methods of Control : 2.2.5.1.  Stuffed owls and rubber snakes have been advertised to rid hangars and buildings ofbirds. They are usually a waste of money and effort. 2.2.5.2.  Rotating lights have brought conflicting results; but are generally considered ineffective.Birds quickly habituate to these devices, and the problem remains unsolved. 2.2.5.3.  Eyespots on aircraft components are being studied in the United States and other coun-tries. Early results suggest the addition of eyespots does not significantly reduce the BASH poten-tial. 2.2.5.4.  Ultra-sonic devices have thus far proven unsuccessful in deterring wildlife from collidingwith aircraft. Very few bird species can hear ultra-sonic sound. Of the bird species most oftenstruck on airfields, most cannot detect the presence of ultra-sonic sound, therefore rendering thesedevices useless for dispersing birds on an airfield. 2.2.6.  Personnel and Equipment. Each installation with a BASH program should designate andtrain personnel in wildlife dispersal regardless of the severity of the hazard present on the airfield. Inmany instances, the presence of hazardous wildlife is a transient condition and may only requireactive dispersal for short periods throughout the year. Dispersal equipment should be located in thesame area as the personnel tasked with wildlife control so it is readily available when hazards arise. Ifa 15 mm launcher is used, no storage problems should arise. If a Very Pistol with a 12 gauge sleeve isused, the pistol will most likely have to be stored in the armory or in a licensed storage area. AFI91-201 provides guidance on licensing requirements. Installations subject to deployment shouldinclude bird dispersal equipment for such contingencies (see Attachment 7). Each installation shoulddesignate individuals responsible for wildlife dispersal during deployments and properly train thesepersonnel. Additionally, installations should document the training of the aforementioned personnel. 2.3.  Passive Controls. The most permanent methods of discouraging birds from using airfields involveremoving attractive habitat features. Methods to reduce bird attractants include: 2.3.1.  Grass Management. As a minimum, address the following factors: 2.3.1.1.  Grass Height. Maintain airfield vegetation IAW AFI 91-202. Coordinate mowing withperiods of low flight activity. While maintaining the grass height at 7-14 inches, make sure fastergrowing weeds are cut before they go to seed to discourage seed eating birds from using the air-field. Primary focus should be on the grass height and weed seed heads. Grass between 7-14inches discourages flocking species from foraging on the airfield because reduced visibility dis-rupts inter-flock communication and flock integrity by reducing the ability to detect predators.12AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 2004Grass exceeding 14 inches (36 cm) will attract some bird species and rodents, which in turn attractraptors. Airfields with a variety of grass species should be mowed when the average grass height,not including seed heads, exceeds tolerances. Most grass seeds found on the airfield are less desir-able as food than available weed seeds. Although Bahiagrass and some other turf grasses produceprominent seed stalks, the height of these seed heads should not be the sole reason for mowing. Asturf grass will eventually go to seed, mowing to eliminate seeding will increase mowing cycles.Eliminating weeds and cultivating a uniform monoculture of grasses can be more effective in dis-couraging seed-eating birds from feeding on the airfield than mowing grass seed stalks. Beginmowing adjacent to runways and finish in the infield or outer most grass areas. This causes insectsand other animals to move away from aircraft takeoff and landing areas. Also, avoid mowing grassshorter next to the runway than in other areas, as much as possible. 2.3.1.2.  Herbicides and Growth Retardants. Keep broad-leafed weeds to a minimum on theairfield. Apply herbicides as practical to control weeds and comply with AFI 32-1053, Pest Man-agement Program. Broad-leafed weeds attract a variety of birds, may produce seeds or berries,and may limit grass growth. Growth retardants should be tested on small test plots before use onareas in general. 2.3.1.3.  Planting Bare Areas. Reduce bare areas as birds frequently use them to pick up grit andas resting sites on the airfield. Birds need grit, or very small rocks, to crush seeds, allowing diges-tion of the seeds. Eliminating bare areas on the airfield denies access to grit and forces birds seeksources elsewhere. Plant grass adapted to the area, add fertilizer and lime as necessary, and irrigateonly until new grass is established. 2.3.1.4.  Fertilizing. Fertilize as needed to stimulate grasses and promote a uniform cover. Rateand frequency of application may vary from that of other semi-improved grass areas and should bebased on soil test results. 2.3.1.5.  Native Vegetation. In geographic locations where conditions do not support turf growth,such as in desert environments, it may be advisable to allow native vegetation to remain in a natu-ral state (above or below the prescribed height of 7 – 14 inches) as disturbance may provide exoticconditions attractive to some forms of wildlife. The natural state must not supply attractive habitatfor wildlife or obstruct views of the airfield from the tower. Another consideration for airfields inlow-moisture environments is to consider de-vegetation as an option. 2.3.2.  Managing Reforested Areas : Site commercial forest areas so as not to contribute to theinstallation BASH problem. The types of trees planted for forest production are often different thanthose in the surrounding community and may serve as bird roosting sites. For example, the dense can-opy of a planted pine forest in a hardwood region may provide ideal roosting sites. Thinning the roost-ing area can usually discourage the roosting behavior (removing certain trees to produce an open standcanopy). If necessary, remove all trees from the site and grass and maintain the area with other airfieldturf areas. Should a stand of trees contain birds protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or the Baldand Golden Eagle Protection Act or any other species protected by the Endangered Species Act, theUSFWS should be contacted to determine whether an incidental-taking permit is required prior to anytree removal. Federal law clearly indicates that the destruction of wildlife habitat can be tantamount toa taking of protected species and, in some instances, may not be allowed. 2.3.3.  Landscaping. Shrubs, ornamental trees, shelterbelts, hedgerows, and noise suppression barri-ers are important plantings on a base. However, the airfield and clear zones are not proper places forAFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 200413landscape plantings. These types of vegetation can influence wildlife populations and their move-ments around the base. Trees often intermingle as they mature, forming a continuous canopy. Thisclose, dense foliage attracts birds and is ideal for providing shelter, food, and nesting. Proper planningcan reduce these potential attractants. When planting shrubs, select those species that do not producefruit, especially during the winter. Ripe berries attract birds for short periods each year. Blackbird andstarling roosts are particularly hazardous because of the large number of birds (often numbering in themillions) that may be present in a single roost. Birds can usually be stimulated to move by pruning andthinning trees and shrubs to open the canopy. In some situations, it may be necessary to remove all theplants. Trees and shrubs should not be allowed to grow in the infield areas. 2.3.4.  Removal of Edge Effects. The greatest numbers of species are found where vegetation typeschange from forests to brush, or brush to grass (edge effects). To reduce wildlife problems, keep edgeeffects to a minimum, or as far from the active runway as possible. If an airfield has clumps of brushand shrubs around the grass, more diverse habitat is available. Remove brush and weeds to maintainthe airfield in the most uniform condition possible. This eliminates the cover many birds and rodentsrequire. Single trees or snags on an airfield may provide perches for hawks, owls, or other bird spe-cies. Biodiversity practices should not be implemented on airfields. 2.3.5.  Controlling Drainage. Fresh water is one of the most important airfield wildlife attractants,especially in arid regions and near the seacoast. Standing water creates a source of drinking water anda breeding place for insects, amphibians and other food sources for birds. Mark areas of the airfieldwith chronic standing water after heavy rains. Coordinate with CE or EM to fill, level, and re-seedthese areas with grass to match the rest of the airfield. Since federal and state laws strictly control wet-lands, coordination with CE or EM is a must before making any modifications to airfield drainage.However, non-tidal drainage and irrigation ditches excavated on dry land are not generally consideredto be “waters of the United States” (51 FR 41206, Final Rule for Regulatory Programs of the Corps ofEngineers) and therefore are not considered wetlands. Make airfield drainage ditches as deep as pos-sible to limit the surface area of the water and still allow proper drainage according to civil engineer-ing requirements. Wading birds, such as herons, egrets, and shorebirds, are less likely to use deepdrainage ditches. Grade the banks of the drainage ditches to allow mowing up to the edge of the ditch.Keep drainpipes, culverts, and screens clear of debris so drainage is not impeded. 2.3.6.  Locating Wastewater Treatment Facilities. Waterfowl and shorebirds are often attracted towastewater holding ponds. Birds use the water for resting and sometimes as a food source. Wastewa-ter lagoons are most attractive in arid climates. Ponds designed with steep sides, little surface area,and no vegetation reduces the attraction to birds. Locate ponds as far from the runway and associatedtraffic patterns as possible and place them so birds moving from off-base areas to the ponds do notcross the runways. 2.3.7.  Managing Sanitary Landfills : 2.3.7.1.  On-Base Landfills. Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills are the most significantattractant to hazardous bird species. Operate disposal sites according to FAA guidelines and stateand federal laws. Relocate landfills that do not meet FAA guidelines criteria. If landfill relocationis not feasible, make the site as unattractive to birds as possible. Consider the following methods:Maintain a small working face to minimize exposed wastes; incinerate waste; operate the landfillas a pit or trench to limit access to birds; dump waste at night or during non-flying periods; coverwaste material immediately; discourage gulls and other birds with overhead wire barriers; relocate14AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 2004putrescible wastes to a more remote landfill; and use bioacoustics and pyrotechnics to frightenbirds away. 2.3.7.2.  Off-Base Landfills. The Air Force cannot control land use off-base; however, beforelandfills can be opened, the operator must obtain a state permit. A hearing is held about the poten-tial environmental impact. Air Force concerns about potential bird hazards should be expertly pre-sented at these hearings. Flight safety, environmental planning, public affairs, and the staff judgeadvocate should work jointly to present Air Force interests. HQ AFSC/SEFW will assist by pro-viding consultation and expert testimony as needed. 2.3.8.  Managing Agricultural Outleases. Many bases have agricultural programs on their airfieldsto reduce maintenance costs. These programs range from crop and hay outleases to grazing and refor-estation. The types of crops grown and the agricultural methods used have important effects on localbird populations. 2.3.8.1.  Grain crops within 1,000 feet of the runways are not recommended because harvest meth-ods expose a ready food supply. Hay, cotton, and flax are the least attractive crops. Airfield cropsshould not be radically different from crops found in the surrounding community. Anything thatmakes the airfield unique can attract birds and other wildlife. Cultivation may attract birds byexposing large numbers of insects and earthworms. 2.3.8.2.  Harvesting and planting schedules can also affect the numbers of birds the airfieldattracts. For example, if an airfield hay crop is harvested before or after other hay crops in theregion, large numbers of invertebrates may be exposed on the airfield that are not exposed in otherfields. This might provide a more intense bird attractant than would usually exist. 2.3.8.3.  Agricultural activities should also consider the local flying schedule. Planting, cultivat-ing, harvesting, or burning may temporarily increase airfield bird attractants, therefore should bedone on weekends or other periods of reduced flying. Both airfield management and civil engi-neering personnel (AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management) should closelymonitor agricultural practices used in base agricultural outleases. 2.3.8.4.  Grazing animals can be a serious hazard. Ensure the use of strict animal control andproper fencing. 2.3.9.  Fencing. Proper fencing can reduce airfield incursions by wildlife other than birds. An 8-footchain-link fence topped with outward-facing outriggers and 3 strands of barbed wire will normally beenough to deter most encroachments by deer, coyotes, and other such large animals. The bottom of thefence must be properly secured at or underneath the ground to prevent animals from digging or push-ing under the fence. Another option is an electric fence. Though cheaper than a chain-link fence, anelectric fence requires more maintenance and management over the long-term. Ensure that all fencesare properly closed when not in use and they do not violate the airfield clear zones and frangibilityrules. 2.4.  Hangars. Hangars provide a good environment for birds to nest and roost. Without much threat frompredators and a relatively quiet habitat at night, certain species of birds will take up residency in hangars.In addition to health risks resulting from bird scat and bird mites, the close proximity of hangars to the air-field environment requires attention be given to any birds making a hangar their home. Hangars are easilyaccessible to birds since the doors are usually left open for long periods, particularly in the evenings whenbirds are roosting. Denying birds access to the hangar by keeping the doors closed is the best preventionAFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 200415method but is not practical so either exclusion devices or full-time bird control are necessary inside thehangar. 2.4.1.  Netting. Though expensive, provides an excellent long-term defense against birds returning tohangars. Netting will prevent birds from roosting inside the hangar while allowing the doors to beopen during hangar operations. 2.4.2.  Air Rifles. Use of air rifles to disperse birds in hangars has proven successful in removingbirds. When dealing with a roosting flock of pigeons, starlings or House Sparrows, an air rifle is prob-ably the least expensive control technique. These species are common nuisances in hangars and arenot afforded any Federal legal status because they are non-native or “introduced species.” But thisdoes not mean there are no state or local restrictions. Before shooting any bird, it is wise to check forany applicable state or local laws that may prohibit shooting them. At all times, be certain of the targetspecies. 2.4.3.  Brush Weatherseals. Using brush weatherseals on the edge of the doors or around windowswill remove gaps and seal any open spaces, thereby restricting entry points to birds. 2.4.4.  Strip Curtains. Strip curtains, or vertical blinds, allows the hangar doors to remain open forventilation while limiting access to birds. 2.4.5.  PVC Pipes. Lining the hangar rafters with PVC pipes have proven successful in keeping birdsout of hangers. By reducing the amount of surface available for nesting or roosting, the birds areannoyed enough to look for other structures upon which they can build. 2.4.6.  Falconry. Some birds of prey, Harris Hawks for example, can be very effective at ridding han-gars of roosting birds. Consider the feasibility of including hangars in existing airfield bird control fal-conry contracts or establishing a falconry contract for hangars (reference Section 2.2.4.2.). 2.5.  Flight Operation Considerations:  2.5.1.  When environmental modifications and active control measures do not satisfactorily reducewildlife hazards on the airfield, flying operations may have to be altered to reduce the risk of birdstrikes. As defined in AFI 91-202, Bird Watch Condition (BWC) Codes (see Attachment 1) may be avaluable tool for supervisors to make operational changes. These operational changes are dictated bythe severity of the problem, the performance capability of the aircraft, and training or readinessrequirements. Bird hazards, like any other safety hazards, must be assessed with respect to operationalrequirements. During contingency operations or advanced stages of readiness, bird hazards may haveminimal safety priority. During training to maintain operational readiness; however, certain changescan be made to improve safety, reduce costly repairs, and protect aircrews. 2.5.2.  Flying one hour before and after dawn and dusk should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.The highest levels of bird activity normally occur during these hours as birds leave and return to theirroosts. Avoiding flight operations during these periods can significantly reduce the chance of a birdstrike. 2.5.3.  Knowledge of unit operational and training requirements, combined with an understanding oflocal flying restrictions, is necessary to properly evaluate possible modifications to local procedures. 2.5.4.  The key to reducing bird strikes by changing flight operations is to avoid known locations, con-centrations or movements of birds. The following recommendations can help reduce bird hazards bymodifying operational procedures. 16AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 20042.5.4.1.  Takeoff and Departure. Aircraft making formation departures increase the risk of dam-aging bird strikes when birds are feeding or loafing on or near the runway. Formation and sin-gle-ship interval takeoffs often result in birds being scared up by the lead aircraft, causing thewingman to hit the birds. 2.5.4.1.1.  When the lead aircraft scares up large flocks of birds, the wingman should delaydeparture until the birds are clear of the runway. Pilots of lead aircraft must be alert to warn thewingman of bird hazards during takeoff. This is especially important as the wingman’s atten-tion is focused on the lead aircraft. 2.5.4.1.2.  When flocks of migratory birds are a problem, formation takeoffs and single-shipinterval takeoffs with minimum spacing involving rejoins, increase the risk of serious birdstrikes. All rejoins require greater attention by pilots to the lead aircraft’s position. Theincreased speed required catching the lead aircraft after takeoff increases the risk of damagingbird strikes. When birds are known to be flying in the area, departures under visual meteoro-logical conditions (VMC) may be modified to reduce the risks. Departures should be made intrail, with the rejoin beginning after the aircraft passes 2,000 to 3,000 feet above ground level(AGL). If aircraft are to enter a low-level route immediately or stay at an intermediate altitudefor a prolonged period, tactical formation provides enough aircraft clearance to allow wing-men to stay clear of birds. 2.5.4.2.  Enroute Bird Strikes. Aircrews experiencing enroute bird strikes should abort the mis-sion when practicable. While some engine ingestions or a windscreen strike may be readily appar-ent from the flight deck, the damage from many engine, fuselage, wing, tail, or radome strikescannot be adequately assessed. Continuing a mission may cause greater structural damage andlead to a serious in-flight emergency later. 2.5.4.3.  Low-Level Operations. When flying low-level routes or operating in special use air-space, higher aircraft speeds and greater exposure within bird flight environments lead to manydamaging bird strikes. During these flights, aircrews are involved in cockpit duties, allowing littletime to monitor bird activity. "Heads-up" flying should be stressed as much as possible duringthese critical operations. Attachment 3, "Low-Level Flight Considerations," provides generalguidance for bird avoidance during low-level flight operations. 2.5.4.4.  Low-Level Bird Avoidance Model (BAM). The BAM is a predictive model using Geo-graphic Information System (GIS) technology as a key tool for analysis and correlation of birdhabitat, migration, and breeding characteristics, combined with key environmental, and man-madegeospatial data. The value for each cell (or pixel) of the model is equivalent to the sum of the meanbird mass (in ounces), for all bird species present during a particular daily time period, for one of26 two-week periods in a year. The bird species data set was derived from discrete geographicinformation for observations of 60 key BASH bird species, over a 30-year period. The species datawas acquired from several key datasets, including the Audubon Societies' Christmas Bird Count(CBC), the US Biologic Survey's Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), bird refuge arrival and departuredata for the conterminous US, and many additional data specific to a particular bird species. 2.5.4.4.1.  The risk levels describe three predicted risk classes - Low, Moderate, and Severe,which are based upon the bird mass in ounces per square kilometer. In other words, the risklevels represent the amount of birds (bird mass) in a kilometer squared spatial area. The "Mod-AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 200417erate Zone" indicates a risk ratio that is 57-708 times the risk of the "Low Zone", while the"Severe Zone" indicates a risk ratio that is 2,503-38,647 times the risk of the "Low Zone". 2.5.4.4.2.  The model uses the best available data for historical modeling of bird migratory pat-terns to provide the user with an effective decision making tool. Because birds are dynamiccreatures whose migratory behavior is initiated by weather events in any given year, the modelcannot be said to predict the exact movement of bird species through space and time beyondthe biweekly timeframe. Spatial zones indicating a severe risk according to the model shouldnot be ignored and should be avoided. It is not suggested that pilots fly within the "SevereZone" unless it is absolutely mission essential. 2.5.4.4.3.  The BAM is internet accessible at http://usahas.com/bam/. A link to the BAM ison the AFSC BASH website. 2.5.4.5.  AVIAN HAZARD ADVISORY SYSTEM (AHAS). Like the Bird Avoidance Model(BAM), AHAS provides information on bird activity through the flight route. The distinctionbetween the two is that on the planned flight route or MOA, BAM uses historical data to providea depiction of what one might expect, whereas AHAS uses the BAM as a foundation andNEXRAD weather radar to provide a near real-time description of bird activity. 2.5.4.5.1.  AHAS functions on the principle of assessing bird strike risk. Bird strike risk is thelikelihood of a catastrophic event. This is a function of the mass of a bird: the larger the bird,the higher the risk of a catastrophic event. AHAS provides pilots and commanders with a stan-dardized measurement of bird strike risk. This risk is rated as Low, Moderate, and Severe. Therisk management decisions that are made for each category of bird strike risk depend on thetype of aircraft you are flying. T-38s are much more vulnerable to serious damage from smallbirds than C-130s, for example. In a moderate condition, therefore, you would not expect toimpose as significant risk management measures on C-130s as would be placed on T-38s. Forthis reason, AHAS does not make recommendations on the restrictions that should be imposedfor any category of bird strike risk. These decisions should be made at the local level based onthe airframe, the nature of the mission and the mission priority. 2.5.4.5.2.  AHAS continuously monitors the current bird strike risk using the network ofNEXRAD weather radars to look for bird activity on low-level routes, ranges, MOAs, or in thevicinity of military airfields. When bird activity is detected, in an area where the existingrecords indicate hazardous bird activity should be expected, a warning is generated. Predictivemodels are used for monitoring soaring bird activity that is not visible to NEXRAD. AHASforecasts the bird strike risk for the next 24 hours using the weather observations and forecast-ing models of the National Weather Service. These forecast models predict the bird activityexpected on low-level routes, ranges, MOAs, or in the vicinity of military airfields. 2.5.4.5.3.  AHAS is internet accessible at http://www.ahas.com. Also, a link to AHAS is onthe AFSC BASH website. 2.5.4.6.  Phase I and Phase II. BHWG's should establish Phase I and Phase II periods in additionto the normal BWC codes. As discussed earlier, the BWC codes are the current condition on theairfield. As described in AFI 91-202, the Phase I/II determination alerts aircrews to expected haz-ards when traveling to an airfield or through a particular area. Phase I and II determinations arelargely based on bird migration but may also be based on seasonal agricultural practices in thelocal area. During migration, when bird activity is heavy, the period should be determined to be18AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 2004Phase II. After the migration has passed through, the airfield may return to Phase I. However, ifmigrating birds remain in the local area throughout the winter, Phase II should remain in effectuntil the birds leave during the spring migration. Northern tier bases may find themselves in PhaseII during the summer breeding season and in Phase I during the winter when most of the birdsmove south. The BAM may be helpful in determining Phase I/II at a particular CONUS location.Phase II declarations may warrant increased bird dispersal activities, more frequent airfieldchecks, and/or changes to flight operations. The base BASH plan should detail any requiredchanges to BASH responsibilities or flight operations during Phase II. 2.5.4.7.  Aircrew Preparations : 2.5.4.7.1.  Wildlife hazards should be considered and incorporated into the mission planningprocess IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3. This would include applicable bird advisories and hazardinformation, available through Internet sources, Automated Terminal Information System(ATIS), or as disseminated locally. 2.5.4.7.2.  Briefings on bird strikes and other wildlife hazards are much like briefings on take-off emergencies when urgency dictates a pre-planned course of action. As a minimum, aircrewbriefings should include the following: Potential bird hazards along their proposed route offlight; use of the double helmet visors or sunglasses during daylight hours, the clear visor atnight or during low-level operations; avoidance maneuvers at low altitude; actions if flocks ofbirds are encountered (for example, initiate a climb since the majority of birds dive to avoid apotential collision; and mission abort due to bird/wildlife strike 2.5.4.7.3.  The aircrew's ability to react to a bird strike situation is further enhanced by period-ically reviewing bird strike procedures during continuation training and safety briefings. 2.5.4.8.  Informing Transient Aircrews of Local Bird Hazards. Transient aircrews are oftenunfamiliar with airfield hazards, including birds. At some bases, the most damaging bird strikeincidents happen to transient aircraft. Information in the Flight Information Publications (FLiP)(IFR-Enroute Supplement, VFR-Enroute Supplement, and Area Planning/1B), and broadcasts ofinformation on either Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) or on initial radio contactcan alert the aircrew of potential bird hazards. Advisory reports can inform aircrews of the timingand location of transient birds. AFI 91-202 requires publishing Phase I/II periods in FLiP. 2.5.4.9.  Aircrew Responsibility. Aircrews are essential to detecting bird hazards on the airfieldand in the local flying area. When aircrews sight birds, they should notify other aircrews and thecontrolling agency. Aircrews may also help Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel remain aware ofbird hazards by requesting bird hazard information before takeoff and landing. These requestsremind air traffic controllers to be alert for birds when authorizing aircraft movements. 2.5.4.10.  Bird Hazard Identification. Bird populations, both in the local area and in regionswhere low-level sorties are flown, should be monitored. Aircrews should be made aware of thepotential bird hazards they face. In addition to the USAF BAM and AHAS, information on birdconcentrations and movements can be obtained from local universities, state and federal wildlifeagencies, and private organizations such as the National Audubon Society. 2.6.  Technical Assistance. Up to date information on wildlife control and hazard reduction methods isavailable from several sources. AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 2004192.6.1.  USAF BASH Team. The BASH Team assists in bird hazard reduction Air Force-wide. BASHTeam personnel are trained in bird control and have experience in wildlife ecology, land management,and flight operations. They also have current information on authorized control equipment and tech-niques. A great deal of BASH information can be found on the USAF BASH website: http://safety.kirtland.af.mil/AFSC/Bash/home.html 2.6.2.  Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA). The BASH Team works closely withAFCESA personnel both to control pest birds in structures and for vegetation control requiring agron-omy or entomology expertise. 2.6.3.  Federal and State Agencies. Often, bases employ professional wildlife biologists, foresters,or agronomists who have valuable insights into base problems. Local expertise and assistance is avail-able through the USDA Wildlife Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or state natural resourcesdepartment. Attachment 4 contains a listing of agencies that can assist your BASH efforts. 2.6.4.  Private consultants. In addition to Federal and state wildlife specialists, private consultantsare available, via contract, to assist bases in resolving wildlife hazards. Private wildlife consultantspossessing the proper wildlife hazard management background would be acceptable to provide assis-tance with the base BASH effort. 2.6.5.  Literature. The following literature provides useful information on wildlife control methodsand hazard reduction. For information on how to obtain copies, please contact the USAF BASHTeam. 2.6.5.1.

Although it would be impossible to site an example of allpotential wildlife hazards found on airfields, the following are brief descriptions of general types of wild-life found on or around airfields and effective management techniques that may be used. It is very impor-tant to know which species is present before management techniques are applied. An appropriate fieldguide should be used to aid in identification. Additional information on management techniques may befound on the AFSC/SEFW website. NOTE: Application of the management techniques suggested below may require coordination withstate and Federal authorities and compliance with AFI 32-7061, Environmental Impact AnalysisProcess (EIAP), as promulgated by 32 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 989, 1999 (Amended,March 2001), the Air Force's supplement to the CEQ NEPA implementing regulations. Forinstance, filling in a swamp or wetland may require a state or Federal Clean Water Act section 404permit. Similarly, action affecting flood plains or wetlands will require a Finding of No PracticalAlternative (FONPA) in compliance with Executive Orders (EO) 11990 and 11988 (see AFIs32-7061 and 32-7064). The direct or indirect taking of protected birds may require state or Federalpermits or may not be permitted under any circumstances. Moreover, actions resulting in thedestruction of protected wildlife habitat, or even certain harassment techniques, may similarly beabsolutely prohibited. In all cases, if an endangered species or a protected species may be present,base authorities should consult with the USFWS and obtain any necessary permits before takingany actions to control wildlife hazards. Consult the base environmental flight to ensure compliancewith state and Federal statutes and regulations. 3.2.  Loons, Grebes, Pelicans, Cormorants, Mergansers. These are fish-eating birds. Control is bestaccomplished by removing fish-producing ponds near the airfield. Since removal of the food source is notalways possible, pyrotechnics are effective in frightening birds from the area. A gridwire system on apond may also be effective in discouraging these birds. Avoid flying at sunrise and sunset when largeflocks, often in formation, can be found flying to and from feeding areas. 3.3.  Pelagic Birds (Albatross, Petrels, Shearwaters, Auks, etc.). Control of these birds is nearlyimpossible since natural predators are rare and the birds exhibit little fear of man or aircraft. Avoid flyingnear nesting areas during the brief summer nesting period. These huge nesting colonies are located onsteep, rocky coastlines or on islands where many thousands of birds may concentrate. 3.4.  Long-Legged Waders (Herons, Egrets, Ibises, Storks). Most of these species are attracted towater where they feed on fish, amphibians, reptiles, and arthropods. Control is best accomplished by elim-inating the food sources. Steepening the sides of ditches and ponds and removing emergent vegetationwill drastically reduce accessibility to food sources. Use pyrotechnics to disperse any birds occurring afterhabitat modification. 3.5.  Cattle Egrets. These birds have different feeding habits than their relatives, preferring open fieldswhere they primarily feed on insects. Cattle Egrets will commonly follow mowers for the invertebratesand other small animals stirred up or maimed and left behind by the mowing operation. When CattleEgrets are present, mow during non-flying hours. Maintain grass between 7 to 14 inches. Periodic pesti-AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 200421cide application may be necessary for insect control. Eliminate roost sites on or near base by removing orthinning roost trees and brush and dispersing the birds each evening with pyrotechnics. 3.6.  Waterfowl (Ducks, Geese, Swans). A distinction must be made between resident and migratingpopulations. 3.6.1.  Resident waterfowl are attracted to an area to breed or feed. Ponds, lakes, ditches, etc., mayattract these birds, particularly if these areas contain emergent or submerged vegetation for feeding,nesting, or shelter. Steepening ditch and pond banks and removing vegetation will reduce waterfowlnumbers. When possible, drain water sources after ensuring compliance with wetlands laws and regu-lations. Wetland areas should be relocated as far from the runways and traffic patterns as possible.Grain fields may also attract waterfowl in large numbers and should be eliminated. Pyrotechnics alongwith gas cannons are somewhat effective control techniques for waterfowl. Use of live ammunition oropening base areas to waterfowl hunting are excellent methods of control. Resident waterfowl act aslive decoys for migrating waterfowl and should not be allowed to linger on or near the airfield. Resi-dent birds are most active at dawn and dusk, moving at low altitudes to and from feeding areas. Avoidflying near wildlife refuges or any ponds, lakes, or rivers with known waterfowl concentrations duringthese periods of the day. 3.6.2.  Migrating waterfowl are particularly dangerous to aviation due to the large numbers and gen-erally higher altitude of the birds. Large flocks of waterfowl travel along traditional flyways to theirbreeding and wintering grounds during spring and fall, respectively. Huge flocks may stop along theroute awaiting favorable weather conditions to continue. Migrating birds are most active from sunsetthrough midnight, with numbers decreasing in the early morning hours. October and November aremost hazardous. Avoid flying during the evening hours if possible. Reference the online BAM andAHAS for bird hazard information associated with waterfowl migration and low-level routes. Winter-ing concentration areas should be avoided. 3.7.  Raptors (Hawks, Falcons, Kites, Eagles, Vultures). These birds can be particularly hazardous toaircraft because of their size and widespread distribution. Raptors (particularly vultures) use thermals totheir advantage in search of prey. These birds become active during mid-morning and remain aloft untillate afternoon. Avoid areas with thermal generating terrain such as ridgelines, rolling hills, and near largebodies of water. Landfills are particularly attractive to soaring vultures. In the fall, raptors migrate by dayto areas of heavy winter concentrations in the southern states and through Central America. Removingdead animals on the airfield, proper management of landfills, rodent control on airfields, and removal ofdead trees and restricting access to other perching sites on the airfield can control these birds. Use pyro-technics to frighten raptors from the airfield. Radio controlled airplanes can be effective in dispersing rap-tors from an airfield. 3.8.  Grouse, Quail, and Pheasants. These game birds are most effectively controlled through propergrass-height management. Do not allow grass to exceed 14 inches and eliminate all brush, weed patches,and areas of bare ground on the field. Pyrotechnics, gas cannons, live ammunition or periodic hunts caneffectively disperse these birds. The killing of these birds outside the normal hunting season requires dep-redation permits from the US Fish and Wildlife Service and state wildlife agencies. 22AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 20043.9.  Cranes. These large birds are most hazardous during migration, particularly in the fall when manythousands of birds may be concentrated in a small area. Avoid flying at dawn and dusk in areas of knownconcentrations. Use pyrotechnics on the airfield to disperse these birds. 3.10.  Sandpipers and Shorebirds. The most significant hazard from these birds occurs when largenumbers, flocking in tight groups, are present, particularly during migration and along coastlines. Manyof the upland species such as Upland Sandpipers and Buff-Breasted Sandpipers may nest on airfields inspring and early summer. Other species such a Killdeer are quite adept at avoiding aircraft and do not posea significant hazard. Flocks in coastal areas can be hazardous and should be avoided. To control thesebirds, observe proper grass height management, eliminate water in puddles, and steepen ditch banks tolimit access to the water. Use pyrotechnics for all species. Some of these birds respond well to bioacous-tics. 3.11.  Gulls. When including both commercial and military bird strikes, gulls represent the most signifi-cant hazard to aircraft worldwide. Due to their omnivorous feeding habits and preference for flat, openareas to rest, they are commonly found on airfields. Gulls are most active just after sunrise and before sun-set as they move to and from feeding areas. Improperly operated landfills are a significant source ofattraction for gulls and should not be allowed in the airfield vicinity. Maintain grass height between 7 and14 inches. This is critical in reducing gull numbers. Even with this in effect, gulls may inhabit the airfield,particularly during inclement weather. Persistent harassment using pyrotechnics and bioacoustics is nec-essary to discourage these birds. Gulls respond very well to falconry as a control technique. Occasionally,use live ammunition to reinforce these techniques (permits required). Control of earthworms and insects(especially grasshoppers) may need to be accomplished if these invertebrates are attracting gulls to theairfield. Do not allow these birds to establish a habit of using the airfield to feed, breed, or rest. 3.12.  Terns. These are fish eating, gull-like birds common in coastal areas and on some major river sys-tems and lakes. Avoid flying near areas where these birds may be active, such as nesting colonies or piersin coastal areas. Remove the food source or eliminate the fish-containing ponds if these birds pose a sig-nificant hazard. 3.13.  Pigeons and Doves. These birds are seedeaters and are attracted to seed-producing weeds, grasses,and shrubs. Open areas or bare spots are attractive as resting or feeding sites. Pyrotechnics can be effec-tive in frightening these birds. Proper turf management can limit the number of pigeons and doves on thefield. A falconry program may effectively control pigeons and dove on the airfield. Pigeons frequentlyoccur in structures such as hangars. Netting, shooting, trapping, use of falcons or hawks, and poison bait-ing can drastically reduce their numbers in these structures. 3.14.  Owls. Most owls are nocturnal and attracted to rodents as a food source. Remove perch sites suchas unnecessary fence posts and dead trees or use exclusion devices on airfield structures to limit the num-ber of owls. Rodent control may be necessary if owls or other raptors are the most significant bird hazardat an airfield. However, managing airfield grass for rodent control can cause new bird hazards to develop,such as blackbirds, starlings, and gulls. Owls hunting inside hangars at night can drastically reduce pigeonpopulations. Burrowing Owls are common airfield residents in the western US. These owls occupy exist-ing ground squirrel and prairie dog burrows. Burrowing owls are most active in the early morning and lateevening hours, hunting insects, reptiles, and small rodents. They should not be allowed to establish resi-dency on the airfield. AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 2004233.15.  Goatsuckers (Nighthawks, Whip-poor-wills, etc.). These birds are active, particularly at sunsetwhen insects are abundant. Little can be done to limit their numbers other than insect control. Avoid fly-ing at times when these birds are abundant, particularly near lakes, streams, or other areas with largeinsect populations. Turning off all but necessary ramp lighting will reduce insect attraction after dark andreduce this important food source for these species. 3.16.  Woodpeckers. Woodpecker strikes should be extremely rare. These birds are common in forestedareas, but generally remain below canopy level. On the airfield, elimination of trees should eliminatestrikes with these birds. Migratory birds may be encountered, but are rarely struck. 3.17.  Flycatchers. These birds are present on airfields, feeding on insects. Strikes are infrequent, butshould not be overlooked. Controlling insects and removing perch sites such as fence posts, tree limbs,bushes, high spots on the airfield, etc., best accomplishes control. 3.18.  Horned Larks. These birds are very difficult to control. They are attracted to bare spots, such asthose along runway edges, to eat weed seeds and insects. The best defense against these birds is thick, uni-form grass with no bare spots. In the southwest, this may not be possible, as grass cannot be maintainedwithout intense irrigation. Consider coating bare spots, particularly along runways, with oil-base orasphalt cover. Use pyrotechnics, but these birds will tend to fly only short distances and settle down. Per-sistence with this specie is the key to success. 3.19.  Swallows and Pratincoles. These birds eat insects in flight and are commonly found above air-fields. Fortunately, swallows are adept at avoiding aircraft, but if they do present a problem, measures canbe taken for their dispersal. Insect control will reduce swallow numbers and discouragement of nestingwill further decrease numbers. Wash mud nests from eaves, culverts, etc., with a hose as the birds begin tobuild, but prior to eggs being laid. Harassing the birds as they work on building nests can discourage nest-ing in banks. If swallows are noted resting on runways or taxiways, use pyrotechnics to disperse them.Fogging methylanthranilate is occasionally successful in dispersing swallows from an airfield but thebirds will often return the next day so persistence is the key to success. 3.20.  Crows and Ravens. These omnivorous birds are common in open areas and around landfills.These birds may occur in large flocks, particularly at sunset as they return to roost sites. Propergrass-height management will reduce population numbers. Remove any known roost sites or thin individ-ual trees. Operate landfills in a manner to discourage these birds. Use bioacoustics and pyrotechnics tofrighten these birds if they occur on the field. 3.21.  Blackbirds, Grackles, Cowbirds, and Starlings. These birds can be particularly hazardousbecause they frequently occur in huge flocks, sometimes in the millions. Blackbirds and starlings areattracted to flat, open areas to feed, rest, or stage/pre-roost. Maintain grass height between 7 and 14 inchesto best reduce airfield blackbird and starling numbers. Do not allow seed-producing weeds to grow on theairfield nor outlease grain crops in areas where these birds are known to occur. Eliminate roost sites nearthe flight line. Selectively prune or remove roost trees, brush, or cattails if blackbirds and starlings areroosting on base. Blackbirds and starlings respond well to an intense frightening program using bioacous-tics and pyrotechnics. Use other methods to supplement this program as necessary. Starlings are not fed-erally protected and may be killed without permits. Permits are required for other species. Occasionalshooting of birds will reinforce other frightening techniques. Consider poisoning or trapping, with US24AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 2004Fish and Wildlife Service or USDA/ Wildlife Services assistance. Avoid at all costs flying near knownblackbird and starling roosts, especially at sunrise and sunset and during spring and fall migration. Hugeroosting colonies may also be present during winter months in southern states. 3.22.  Meadowlarks. These birds occur on nearly every airfield and are attracted to grasslands and lowweeds. Eliminate broad-leaf weeds and maintain grass height at 7 to 14 inches. Elimination of suitableperching sites, such as fence posts and brush, will also aid in reduction. Use pyrotechnics, but remembermeadowlarks usually fly only a short distance before settling down again. Persistence is the key to suc-cess. 3.23.  House Sparrows. Aircraft do not frequently strike these birds, but they are common pests aroundstructures. House Sparrows often nest in hangars and dense shrubs and trees. These birds are not protectedby law and may be killed without permits. Frightening techniques are usually ineffective against thesebirds. 3.24.  Warblers. The wide range of species of warblers thrives in a variety of habitats. Most prefershrubs, trees, or riparian habitats where they feed, breed, or rest. Do not allow these habitat types on theairfield and warbler strikes will be rare as a result. Migrating warblers may be struck at night, especiallyas they fly south in the fall. Fortunately, these birds are very small and rarely cause damage. 3.25.  Fringillids (Sparrows, Finches, Grosbeaks, and Buntings). Most Fringillids are not hazardousto aircraft operations, but occasional large flocks can be encountered, particularly during migration. Thesebirds are seedeaters as a rule, and most prefer weedy, brushy, or forested areas. Proper grass height man-agement is the best means of control. Grass exceeding 14 inches will attract many of these birds andshould not be allowed. Use pyrotechnics to frighten many of these birds; success may be limited with oth-ers. 3.26.  Other Wildlife. While concern is mostly centered on birds, several mammalian species also pose athreat to flight operations and must be considered. Close coordination with the Integrated NaturalResources Management Plan is necessary to reduce this type of hazard. 3.26.1.  Deer. Members of the deer family (including moose, elk and caribou) occasionally occur onairfields. These species are generally browsers, preferring broad-leaf weeds, shrubs, and trees. Do notallow growth of these plants on the airfield. The presence of these plants in surrounding areas willserve to draw these animals from the airfield. Tall fences (reference section 2.3.9. of this document)can discourage these animals from entering airfields. Fencing should be secured to the ground as deerwill often push under a fence with little more than an 8 – 10 inch opening. Long term maintenance andmanagement costs of electric fences may offset any short term cost savings. On-base hunting will alsodiscourage the presence of deer species. Use pyrotechnics to frighten these animals when they dooccur on the airfield. NOTE: During hunting season, local hunting pressure may cause an increase in the on-base populationas deer seek refuge. 3.26.2.  Coyotes and Foxes. These animals are attracted to airfields by rodents, rabbits, and otherfood sources. Dens may be found in banks, culverts, or other suitable areas. Chain link fencing usedfor deer control will also be effective in excluding coyotes from entering the airfield. Rodent controlmay reduce the numbers of these animals. Use pyrotechnics to frighten these species. OccasionalAFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 200425shooting of individual animals or recurrent pests will also reduce the hazard. Coordinate with basenatural resources personnel on permit requirements. 3.26.3.  Rabbits and Hares. In addition to direct hazards to aircraft, these animals often attract rap-tors. Proper grass management will reduce the numbers of these animals on airfields. Occasionalextensive rabbit hunts on the field can reduce populations for several subsequent years. Trapping orpoisoning can also be effective for reduction of populations. Permits may be required. 3.26.4.  Rodents. These animals attract raptors, coyotes, and foxes. The base civil engineer pest man-ager or USDA Wildlife Services may use rodenticides in some cases. 3.26.5.  Bats. Similar to birds only in that they are capable of flight, these winged mammals may posea threat to aircraft operations, particularly at dusk. In addition, they may carry diseases such as rabies.Although generally beneficial, bats may pose hazards if roosts develop in specific locations. Baseenvironmental initiatives to support bat colonies should consider flying activity as well as base hous-ing prior to establishing habitat for bats. 3.27.  Form Adopted.

Flying routes under the following conditions should be avoided: A3.1.1.  Areas with known raptor (birds of prey) concentrations during summer, especially during1000-1700 hours, due to increased thermals. Generally, a maximum altitude of 3,000-4,000’ AGL isreached by all raptor species, though soaring can occur at considerably higher altitudes. A3.1.2.  Areas with ideal terrain for creating thermals during summer months, such as ridgelines, roll-ing hills and areas near large bodies of water. This applies to southern Florida and Texas during winter. A3.2.  Should avoid flying one hour before and after sunrise/sunset when there is a known increase in birdactivity to reduce potential hazards, or when in the following areas: All coastal areas, Great Lakes region,and Great Salt Lake to avoid gulls and shorebirds; areas of known blackbird and starling roosts. Informa-tion is available from the USFWS and local experts; and Known local concentrations of waterfowl(ducks, geese, pelicans and swans). A3.3.  Potential bird strike hazards increase at altitudes with most favorable wind speed and direction formigrating birds (particularly near shear altitudes) up to 48 hours prior to and 24 hours after frontal pas-sage; especially during October and November. Weather is a prime stimulus for migratory bird move-ments. A3.4.  Flying near wildlife refuges, landfills, stockyards, and food processing plants should be avoided, asthese all attract birds. A3.5.  The following should be obtained from the Internet to best assess low-level and special use air-space bird hazards: Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) bird hazard risk predictions. The BAM may beaccessed at www.usahas.com or through the USAF BASH web page (safety.Kirtland.af.mil/AFSC/Bash/home.html); and Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) near real time bird risk predictions. AHAS canbe accessed at www.usahas.com or through a link from the USAF BASH web page (safety.Kirt-land.af.mil/AFSC/Bash/home.html). A3.6.  The following may be obtained from HQ AFSC/SEFW, Kirtland AFB to best assess low-levelroute hazards: Specific guidance when unusual bird movements are noted and guidance in specific geo-graphical areas. A3.7.  Consider the following operational changes to reduce threats from bird strikes, mission require-ments permitting: Reduce low-level flight time; reduce formation flying; reduce airspeed at low-levels;and increase altitudes during low-level flights. 32AFPAM91-212   1 FEBRUARY 2004Attachment 4 US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ANIMAL WILDLIFE SERVICES AND US FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE OFFICES A4.1.
