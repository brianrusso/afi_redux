PurposeThis publication identifies multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) for Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA). At the tactical level, it assists military planners, commanders, and individual Department of Defense (DOD) components employing military resources and integrating with National Guard Civil Support activities while responding to domestic emergencies in accordance with United States (US) law. Note: For the Army, the term “command and control” was replaced with “mission command.” Mission command now encompasses the Army’s philosophy of command (still known as mission command) as well as the exercise of authority and direction to accomplish missions (formerly known as command and control).2. ScopeThis publication provides procedures for actions taken by DOD components when directed to support local, territorial, state, federal, or tribal agencies responding to domestic emergencies. Support can be: expertise, equipment, personnel, plans, organization, communication, training, or other resources. 3. ApplicabilityThis publication establishes MTTP applicable to DOD components tasked with supporting domestic incident response, including: natural or man-made disaster response operations, national special security events (NSSEs), or support to law enforcement. This MTTP enables DOD organizations to integrate their capabilities with civil authorities into response operations. The focus of this MTTP is on those DOD forces serving in a Title 10, United States Code (USC) role. National Guard Civil Support in either a Title 32, USC or state active duty role are discussed, but are not limited by the discussion within this MTTP.  4.

Military (operating under all authorities) and civilian after-action reports identify the need for expanded joint military and interagency procedures to enhance military and civil interoperability. For effective DSCA operations, active, reserve, and NG personnel operating under differing military authorities should understand the integration of capabilities, duties, and legal limitations as they support state and federal civilian agencies.  DSCA domestic emergencies or activities (including all hazard disaster response operations) present unique challenges for the Department of Defense (DOD) because personnel work under differing legal authorities and chains of command when coordinating and working with non-DOD, state, local, and tribal agencies. This publication enhances military understanding as Title 10, USC, and Title 32, USC, DOD forces work side by side in typical DSCA force organizations and outlines some of the challenges impacting DOD support operations.Chapter I The Homeland and Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) Operating Environment Chapter I provides an overview of how operating in the homeland differs from overseas areas of responsibility. It explains homeland security, homeland defense, and DSCA.This chapter discusses the role of federal military forces and state NG forces. It introduces authorities including: Title 10 and Title 32, USC, and state active duty. This chapter summarizes the National Incident Management System and National Response Framework. It includes a section on basic command and control and illustrates dual-status and parallel command structures. Overall, it emphasizes unity of effort with or without unity of command. Chapter II Legal and Policy Considerations Chapter II highlights the unique legal and policy considerations associated with DSCA operations. It discusses approval authorities, immediate response authority, disaster response under the Posse Comitatus Act and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief andEmergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act). Furthermore, it addresses rules for using force and intelligence oversight, and using DOD imagery support. Chapter III General Operational Planning and Execution Chapter III highlights general planning and execution considerations in a DSCA environment, such as facility availability, evacuation considerations, and communications. This chapter focuses on factors unique to the DSCA mission. Chapter IV Commander and Staff Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) Mission Considerations  Chapter IV provides DSCA environment-specific planning and execution considerations for military forces. This chapter describes and compares the overall responsibility of (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67 xieach key billet and its coordination with civilian counterparts. Additionally, it provides a breakdown of anticipated requirements of a typical operation to a tactical-level staff byphase of operation. Chapter V Domestic Activities and Special Events Chapter V provides an overview of the environment, impacts, and likely military missions for specific DSCA events, including: wildfires; earthquakes; floods; winter storms; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear events; special events; and cyber-attacks.

Backgrounda. There are critical differences among homeland defense operations, DSCA, andoperations conducted outside the United States (US). Principally, these differences are the roles of civilian organizations; the relationship of military forces to federal, state, tribal, and local agencies; and the legal authorities under which military forces operate. US military personnel must understand the domestic environment so they can legally employ military capabilities efficiently and effectively. b. The US exercises sovereignty of its land areas and 12 nautical miles out to seaand has internationally recognized responsibilities extending 200 nautical miles from the coast. Military forces may support civil authorities anywhere within this area, with the proper approvals. c. Homeland security and homeland defense are complementary components of theNational Security Strategy. Homeland defense is the protection of US sovereignty, territory, domestic population, and critical defense infrastructure against external threats and aggression, or other threats as directed by the President of the United States (POTUS) according to joint publication (JP) 3-27, Homeland Defense.Missions are defined as homeland defense if the nation is under a concerted attack. The Department of Defense (DOD) leads homeland defense and is supported by the other federal agencies. In turn, the DOD supports the nation's homeland security effort, which is led by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Homeland security is the concerted national effort to: prevent terrorist attacks within the US; reduce America's vulnerability to terrorism, major disasters, and other emergencies; and minimize damage and recover from attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies described in JP 3-28, Defense Support of Civil Authorities. A review of the relationship among homeland defense, homeland security, and DSCA is located in JP 3-28. This publication principally focuses on aspects associated with homeland security: DSCA and National Guard Civil Support (NGCS). d. DSCA operations are vital aspects of the military’s service to the nation. DSCA issupport provided by the US federal military forces, DOD, component assets, and National Guard (NG) forces in response to requests for assistance from civil authorities for domestic emergencies, law enforcement support, and other domestic activities, according to DOD directive (DODD) 3025.18, Defense Support of Civil Authorities.  e. The National Guard Bureau (NGB) defines NGCS as support provided by theNational Guard (NG) of the states while in state active duty (SAD) status or Title 32,United States Code (USC) duty status to civil authorities for domestic emergencies and designated law enforcement and other activities. Figure 1 provides a comparison of DSCA and NGCS. (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.671 Note: Laws and statutes determine whether NG forces are conducting NGCS, DSCA, or both. NG authorities are under Title 32 or Title 10 USC. These authorities as well as duty status (e.g., SAD) determine the restrictions under which NG forces operate andare discussed further in chapter II. Figure 1.  DSCA and NGCS f. When in support of civilian authorities, all military forces remain under theoperational control (OPCON) and administrative control (ADCON) of their federal or state military chains of command. Federal military forces always remain under the command of the POTUS through the Secretary of Defense (SecDef) and the supported combatant commander (CCDR). g. United States Coast Guard (USCG) forces integrate into the federal responseunder Title 14, USC authority and remain under the OPCON and ADCON of their USCG chain of command. 2. Authorities Governing DSCAa. The authorities for provision of DSCA are found in US law, DOD policy, Chairmanof the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) orders, and CCDR orders. The authorities forDOD components to conduct DSCA operations are found in DODD 3025.18, and standing CJCS, US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), and US Pacific Command (USPACOM) DSCA execute orders (EXORDs). JP 3-28 and Service-specific implementation listed in the references section of this publication provide additional guidance. Chapter II and appendix A discuss approval authority in more detail. b. Each state has laws specifying NG authority for providing DSCA. Agreementsamong states for mutual aid under the emergency management assistance compact (EMAC) and memoranda of agreement also fall under state laws. DODD 5105.77, 2 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015National Guard Bureau, outlines the responsibilities of the NGB established in federal law. 3. Legal LandscapeOperations conducted by the US military in the homeland and US territories are very different from operations conducted overseas. These homeland operations are conducted under the authority and within the limitations of federal, state, and local laws. During these operations, Titles 10 and 32 USC forces support civil authorities as part of federal or state-led responses. DSCA operations provide a unique legal landscape not typical of the usual range of military operations trained for and conducted by the DOD. Chapter II provides additional information regarding legal considerations. 4. Overview of the National Response Framework (NRF), National IncidentManagement System (NIMS), and Incident Command System (ICS)a. The NRF presents the guiding principles preparing all response partners toprovide a unified national response to domestic disasters and emergencies. It establishes a comprehensive, national, all-hazards approach to a domestic incident response. The NRF defines the principles, roles, and structures to organize a national response. b. The Federal Government, and many states, use emergency support functions(ESFs) as the primary mechanisms to organize and provide assistance. Under the NRF, ESFs organize into 14 functional areas. Appendix C lists the federally recognized ESFs. Many states have more than 14 ESFs. c. The NIMS provides terminology and organizational processes establishing atemplate for incident management. This system enables unity of effort among local, tribal, state, and federal governments, as well as private sector and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), in disaster response operations. Five major components make up this system’s approach: preparedness; communications and information management; resource management; command and management; and ongoing management, maintenance, and supporting technologies. d. The ICS is a management system enabling effective, efficient, and flexibleincident management. ICS addresses incident command in terms of single incident, area and unified command. Command and general staffs support the incident commander (IC) with functions depicted in figure 2. Note: ICS forms are part of the National Interagency Incident Management System. (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67 3 Figure 2. ICS Note: ICS concept of “command” is different from the military use of this term. Military forces in a DSCA environment will remain under the OPCON and ADCON of the military chain of command. DOD components are not directly under the command of the IC, but instead, work in a supporting role by providing a capability or resource. 5. Overview of the Department of Homeland Securitya. DHS is a Presidential, cabinet-level organization with the responsibility of securityof the homeland, including response to national disasters at the federal level. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and USCG are part of DHS. b. FEMA is organized into ten regions, shown in figure 3. Each region serves as thefocal point for organizing and coordinating state and federal emergency management for incidents within the region. Figure 3.

Mobile diving and salvage units can survey and clear harbors of navigational hazards, conduct underwater search and recovery, and perform limited underwater repairs. (d)  Naval Construction Force. Navy engineer units, such as Navy mobile construction battalions, construction battalion maintenance units, and underwater construction teams, offer substantial capabilities for route opening, collapsed structure search and rescue (SAR), and expedient infrastructure repair.

(b)  Naval response to a CCDR identified or anticipated requirement will drive identification of available capabilities, planning, and execution timelines; including marshalling, movement, and embarkation. (c)  To support DSCA operations, Marine units are organized into Marine Air-Ground Task Forces scaled and tailored in accordance with the requirements of each specific situation and mission. Appendix C depicts dual-use capabilities resident with USN and USMC (3)Forces. b. The USCG is one of the US Armed Forces, as prescribed in Title 14, USC,Section 1. The USCG executes a variety of missions, including SAR, maritime law enforcement, and defense readiness. The USCG may have support teams assisting the federal response during incidents. Figure 4 shows the USCG districts. (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.675 Figure 4.  USCG Districts USCG bases span the US, and a major disaster response likely will involve (1)the USCG. The USCG does not require a declaration of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) to engage in emergency response activities because this authority is inherent in Title 14, USC, federal laws, and DHS policies covering USCG activities. USCG forces involved in a federal response may include: (a)  District and sector staffs. (b)  Marine safety units and detachments. (c)  Small boat stations. (d)  Air stations. (e)  Cutters.

Deployable specialized forces provide expertise to law enforcement units and augment local forces with small-boat units and personnel. Aids-to-navigation units provide emergency harbor surveys, in coordination (4)with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), to ensure ports and waterways are navigable. Marine transportation system recovery units and incident management (5)assistance teams are specialized teams that augment local commanders, reestablish port operations, and run large-scale incident responses.

US Army watercraft and water terminal forces provide support for DCSAoperations. Their primary mission is bolstering overseas combat contingencies, but they serve as dual-use forces for DSCA missions, often with USN, USMC, and USCG maritime forces. US Army Forces Command serves as the single, force provider for the Army The Army employs watercraft capable of moving supplies, equipment and (1)Forces supporting DSCA operations. (2)personnel in shallow coastal waters, inland waterways, and rivers. Army watercraft support logistics operations at sea ports, small terminals, and in environments where shore-based facilities have been damaged or do not exist. Army terminal units conduct cargo operations in sea ports, water terminals, (3)and environments where shore-based facilities have been damaged or do not exist. Army terminal forces include mobile communications systems and, ocean-going and harbor tug boats and mobile cranes. Army engineer dive teams operate closely with terminal units to conduct port clearance and salvage. 7. Tiered Response Overviewa. The primary responsibility for responding to domestic disasters and emergenciesrests with the lowest level of government able to manage the response. If local and state capabilities prove insufficient, state authorities may ask for assistance from other states under existing agreements and compacts. States will normally exhaust their resources and execute existing mutual aid agreements and EMAC before requesting federal assistance. This is known as a tiered response to the disaster. b. Although tiered response is a guiding principle, the stress of an actual disasterresponse may overwhelm resources and capabilities almost simultaneously at all response levels. NG forces may receive an alert order through state channels at the same time federal military forces receive their alert and prepare-to-deploy orders through DOD channels. (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.677 8. State and NG Responsesa. The NG is the first line of military response to most state or local incidents withina state or territory. When the governor of a state mobilizes the NG, the forces are typically in SAD under command and control (C2) of the governor. SAD forces conduct all missions in support of state requirements and within state guidelines and statutes. b. The Chief, National Guard Bureau (CNGB) is the principal advisor to the SecDef,through the CJCS, on matters relating to the NG. The CNGB is also the principal adviser to the Secretaries and Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Air Force on all NG issues. The CNGB serves as the DOD’s official channel of communication with the governors and adjutants general of the 54 National Guards (50 states and territories of Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Guam, and the District of Columbia). The CNGB facilitates and coordinates among states and the DOD, integrating NG support in domestic incidents. c. Each state has a joint force headquarters-state (JFHQ-State) providing C2 of allArmy and Air NG forces. The JFHQ-State serves as the focal point for all NG domestic operations within each state. JFHQ-States can serve as operational headquarters when NG forces conduct domestic operations support in Title 32, USC, or SAD. d. Each joint task force state (JTF-State) may stand up one or more joint task forces(JTFs) supporting internal and external missions. Typically, the JTF-State acts as the tactical headquarters for all in-state NGCS missions. e. In addition to the NG, some states authorize a state defense force as allowed byTitle 32, USC, Section 109. These forces augment the state NG and other civil authorities in an emergency. State defense forces are state entities and are not part of DOD. State defense force members wear the military uniform assigned by the adjutant general (TAG) of the state. f. EMAC is a congressionally ratified, mutual aid agreement between all states andterritories of the US, which provides form and structure to interstate mutual aid. Through EMAC, a disaster-impacted state can request and receive assistance from other member states quickly and efficiently, resolving two key issues up front: liability and reimbursement. 9. Federal DOD DSCA Responsea. The defense coordinating officer (DCO) is the DOD single point of contact fordomestic emergencies. The DCO is assigned to a joint field office to process requirements for military support, forward mission assignments to the appropriate military organizations, and assign military liaisons to activated emergency support functions. The DCO has a defense coordinating element (DCE) consisting of staff and military liaison officers coordinating and supporting activated ESFs. See figure 5 for a sample of an augmented DCE structure. 8 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015Figure 5.  DCEb. Emergency preparedness liaison officers (EPLO) are senior reserve officers whorepresent their Service at the appropriate joint field office conducting planning and coordination responsibilities in support of civil authorities. The USCG, operating under DHS, maintains EPLOs similar to DOD EPLOs but coordinates directly with the FEMA regions. c. Military units in a Title 10, USC status are under federal C2 and usually under theOPCON of USNORTHCOM or USPACOM. In the EXORD or operation order (OPORD) the CCDR will normally authorize direct liaison to designated military unit commanders. As such, they should contact the joint force commander (JFC) or DCO as soon as possible after receipt of DSCA deployment orders to obtain mission specifics, process requests for information, and facilitate mission planning.  10. Request for Assistance (RFA) and Mission Assignment ProcessFEMA coordinates the federal response to a disaster. The agency evaluates a RFA within the joint field office (JFO) and issues a mission assignment to other federal agencies. For more information on these processes, see JP 3-28. 11. JFOa. The JFO is a temporary, multiagency coordination center established at theincident site to provide a central location for coordination of federal, state, local, tribal, nongovernmental, and private-sector organizations. These organizations have primary responsibility for incident oversight, direction, or assistance to effectively coordinate protection, prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery actions. See figure 6 for a sample of the JFO structure. (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.679 Figure 6.  JFO Structure b. Normally, the DCO validates and coordinates DSCA requests originating at theJFO for SecDef approval. With FEMA state emergency manager, state NG, and combatant command (CCMD) support, the DCO reviews DOD suitability to perform a particular RFA and mission assignment. 12. Parallel Federal and State Military Command StructuresIn many DSCA operations, federal and state military forces operate in overlapping areas but under separate chains of command. Within a parallel command structure, there is no single force commander. Federal and state military leaders retain separate C2 of their assigned forces as they provide their individual support to the civil authority. 13. Dual-Status Commander (DSC) Structurea. To unify the military response, federal law permits a DSC to command federalmilitary personnel in a Title 10, USC status and NG personnel in a Title 32, USCstatus or on SAD. Simultaneously, the DSC holds two commissions: state and federal. The commander then commands both Federal and state forces to coordinate the military response and provide unity of effort. b. In accordance with Title 32 USC § 325(a)(2), a NG DSC requires the approval ofthe POTUS (this authority is currently delegated to SecDef) and the consent of the officer’s governor to serve in both duty statuses. For an active duty commissioned officer, pursuant to 32 USC § 315, the Secretaries of the Army or Air Force may detail regular officers to duty with the NG, and with the permission of the POTUS. The detailed officer may accept a commission in the NG without vacating his or her regular appointment. The state or territory will commission the officer in its NG to command its NG forces serving under state authority. State law will dictate the 10 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015requirements and procedures for the appointment and, typically, require the governor’s consent.c. A DSC operates two chains of command simultaneously. The DSC exercisescommand on behalf of, and receives separate orders from, a federal chain of command and exercises command on behalf of, and receives separate orders from, a state chain of command. As such, DSCs typically establishes their own subordinate federal and state chains of command, having Title 10, USC and Title 32,USC or SAD staffs. The subordinate officers and military forces operate in only one status, either state or federal. See figure 7 for an augmented DSC chain of command structure.  Figure 7.

Overviewa. This chapter provides a synopsis of legal principles in DSCA operations. DSCAoperations temporarily support US civilian agencies for domestic emergencies, law enforcement support, and other domestic activities. DODD 3025.18 provides policy guidance for executing and overseeing DSCA. Each Service and the NGB augmented DODD 3025.18 with its own regulations, instructions, and doctrine. b. DSCA operations involve unique legal and policy issues and approval authorities.Typically, Title 10, USC, federal military forces are not first responders. In scope and duration, federal law defines and limits the federal military’s role in DSCA operations. Commanders and their staffs, especially planners and judge advocates, work together closely to plan, monitor, and control DSCA operations to comply with federal and state laws and DOD policies. Additionally, based upon the limitations on the federal military’s role, military members (Title 10 and Title 32, USC and SAD)should be aware of the legal considerations and the legal authority under which they are operating. c. Capability does not equal authority. Approval authorities vary depending on themission and assets. Planners must carefully navigate and apply the appropriate guidance to ensure mission accomplishment, consistent with the law. For further details, see appendix A. d. Operational constraints vary, but include the Posse Comitatus Act (PCA) andintelligence oversight (IO). Additionally there are detailed restrictions for operations involving intelligence community capabilities (ICC). IO provides oversight requirements and governs the collection, dissemination, and timelines for retention of data. e. A Stafford Act request moves from the state emergency operations center (EOC)through the DCO to the SecDef for a decision. At each level, cost, appropriateness, readiness, risk, legality, and lethality (CARRLL) factors determine if the DOD can and should provide the requested support. Cost.

Does the request comply with the law? Do any legal provisions (5)prohibit or restrict the DOD from providing the requested assistance? If prohibited, are there any exceptions? Can an appropriate authority waive the restriction? (6)Lethality. Is there a potential for lethal force by or against federal forces? 2. Approval Authoritiesa. The SecDef, with limited exceptions or unless otherwise delegated, is theapproval authority for all types of DSCA requests submitted by a primary agency. The immediate response authority (IRA) (see paragraph 3.a.) and emergency authority are exceptions for local commanders’ responses to civil authorities’ requests for assistance. There are limitations on the use of certain types of DOD assets which require SecDef approval, such as unmanned aircraft systems (UASs).Normally, the Assistant Secretary of Defense or Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Homeland Defense Integration and DSCA) has been delegated to approve RFAs on behalf of the SecDef. b. The SecDef has designated the Commander, United States Northern Command(CDRUSNORTHCOM) and Commander, United States Pacific Command (CDRUSPACOM), as supported commanders for conducting DSCA operations; as such, they are principle planning agents for DSCA. SecDef approved RFAs are tasked to the appropriate commander for execution. Incident awareness and assessment (IAA), when requested and approved, may be used for: (1)(2)(3)(4)  (5)(6)(7)Situational awareness (SA). Damage assessment. Evacuation monitoring. SAR. CBRN survey following hazard prediction. Hydrographic survey. Dynamic ground coordination. Note: The DSCA EXORD 071415 JUN 13, permits USNORTHCOM and USPACOM to request traditional ICC resources to conduct DSCA missions. SecDef approval authorizes using IAA capabilities for non-intelligence purposes. These missions must be conducted in accordance with federal IO requirements, including DOD 5240.1-R,Procedures Governing the Activities of DOD Intelligence Components that Affect United States Persons. c. DODD 3025.18 codifies the DOD policy for providing disaster assistance inaccordance with the Stafford Act, Public Law 93-28, and Public Law 100-707, the primary statutory authorities for federal disaster assistance within the US and its territories. The Stafford Act authorizes the POTUS to issue emergency or major disaster declarations concerning catastrophes that overwhelm state governments. Once a declaration is made, DOD and other federal assistance may be provided. The Stafford Act is not an exception to the PCA. Federal military forces may only provide indirect assistance following a disaster or emergency declaration. 14 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015Note: The Economy Act of 1932 permits federal agencies to provide resources and services to other federal agencies on a reimbursable basis. The Economy Act is also the basis for the general rule the DOD will not compete with commercial businesses. d. Presidential declarations of emergencies are situations in which federalassistance is required to save lives, protect health and property, or mitigate or avert a disaster. The POTUS may not declare an emergency, unless requested by the affected governor, except when the incident primarily concerns federal functions,property, or personnel. Generally, in terms of scope and time, emergency assistance is not as extensive as major disaster declaration assistance. e. Major disasters are any natural catastrophe (e.g., hurricane, tornado, earthquake,or snowstorm) or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion of sufficient severity. Under the Stafford Act, the governor requesting disaster assistance from the Federal Government must demonstrate the state’s lack of capacity or resources to mount an effective response. Under the designation of a major disaster, the type of assistance may include: Sharing information indicating the existence of a threat to life or property or (1)the violation of law incidentally collected during the normal course of military training or operations. Specifically, this does not permit tasking units or personnel to collect intelligence within the US. (2)(3)(4)(5)  (6)(7)(8)(9)(10)  (11)  (12)  (13)  (14)  (15)  (16)  Using military equipment, spare parts, supplies, and facilities. Providing personnel for equipment maintenance and operation. Providing CBRN incident support. Distributing medicine, food, and consumables. Removing debris and clearing roads. Providing emergency medical care. Transporting supplies and persons. Restoring essential public services. Constructing temporary bridges, shelters, and other necessary structures. Demolishing unsafe structures. Disseminating public information on health and safety measures. Providing technical and advisory assistance to state and local officials. Conducting precautionary evacuations and recovery. Conducting SAR. Providing IAA. 3. IRAa. DSCA normally requires high levels of approval. Upon receiving a civilianauthority’s request, when time does not permit approval from higher authority, and under imminent conditions, local commanders may exercise IRA to save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate great property damage within the US. This authority excludes using UAS or ICC. IRA is not an exception to the PCA. Local commanders do not have complete discretion to support civil authorities under IRA; (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67 15CARRLL provisions must be met. Support provided under IRA will not be delayed or denied based on the inability or unwillingness of the requester to make a commitment to reimburse the DOD.b. IRA is applicable during POTUS declared emergencies, major disasterdeclarations, and non-declared incidents. Intent empowers commanders to act while awaiting official approval, but higher authority must approve the continuation of the IRA mission. c. Through the chain of command, notify the National Joint Operations andIntelligence Center (NJOIC) when forces deploy. The NJOIC will notify the geographic CCDR. For Navy units, an Office of the Chief of Naval Operations instruction (OPNAVINST) 3440.16D requires notification within two hours. USMC commanders must report the decision immediately (via chain of command) to Headquarters, Marine Corps per Marine Corps Order 3440.7B. Per DODD 3025.18: Section 4, paragraph G(1) “The DoD official directing a response under immediate response authority shall immediately notify the National Joint Operations and Intelligence Center (NJOIC), through the chain of command, of the details of the response. The NJOIC will inform appropriate DoD Components, including the geographic Combatant Command”. NG forces in Title 32, USC status must report IRA activities to the NGB as soon as practicable, in accordance with CNGB Notice 1401. d. An immediate response shall end when the necessity giving rise to the responseis no longer present or when the initiating commander or a higher authority directs an end to the response. The commander directing a response under IRA shall reassess whether there remains a necessity for the DOD to respond under this authority not later than 72 hours after the request for assistance was received. e. Commanders providing the IRA support should seek reimbursement after itterminates, with the exception of support provided under the National SAR Plan. Reimbursement arrangements should not affect DOD support of the IRA request and is not mandatory. 4. Emergency AuthorityUnder emergency authority, federal military commanders can engage, temporarily, in activities necessary to quell large-scale, unexpected civil disturbances. In these instances prior authorization by the POTUS is not possible and duly constituted, local authorities are unable to control the situation. Use an emergency authority when under the following circumstances. a. When such activities are necessary to prevent significant loss of life or wantondestruction of property and are necessary to restore governmental functioning and public order. b. When duly constituted federal, state, or local authorities are unable to, or declineto, provide adequate protection for federal property or Federal Governmental functions. Federal action, including the use of federal military forces, is authorized when necessary to protect federal property or functions. 16 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 20155. DOD Support to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) and Civil DisturbanceOperationsa. For fear of military encroachment on civil authority and domestic governance, thePCA and policy limit DOD support to LEA. Department of Defense instruction (DODI) 3025.21, Defense Support of Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, provides guidance on DOD support to LEA. Appendix A lists approval authorities and guidance for employing UAS and ICC for DSCA missions. b. US domestic civil disturbances include riots, acts of violence, insurrections,unlawful obstructions and assemblages, and disorders prejudicial to public law and order. The primary responsibility for protecting life and property and maintaining law and order in the civilian community is vested in the state and local government. Involvement of military forces will only be appropriate in extraordinary circumstances. The authority for civil disturbance operations primarily derives from the Insurrection Act, which vests decision-making authority in the POTUS. The Insurrection Act permits the POTUS to use armed forces under a limited set of specific circumstances and are subject to certain limitations. Responsibility for managing the federal response rests with the Attorney General of the US. Although the Attorney General will have primary responsibility for response to civil disturbances, military forces shall remain under DOD C2 at all times. Use of the military under the Insurrection Act to conduct law enforcement activities is a specific exception to PCA.c. DODI 3025.21 addresses DOD policy on civil disturbance operations. It states,“the employment of federal military forces to control civil disturbances shall only occur in a specified civil jurisdiction under specific circumstances as authorized by the President, normally through issuance of an Executive Order or other Presidential directive authorizing and directing the SecDef to provide for the restoration of law and order in a specific state or locality”. d. With higher headquarters coordination, commanders should preparerecommended mission specific rules for the use of force (RUF). e. Commanders should prepare to conduct operations against personnel,equipment, and installations using non-lethal weapons capabilities. 6. Civil SARa. It is DOD policy to support domestic civil authorities providing civil SAR to thefullest extent practicable on a non-interference basis with military duties. Specifically, the authorities in the National Search and Rescue Plan encourage DOD personnel to provide domestic SAR support. Approval authorities for SAR will depend on the asset used. At a minimum, DODI 3003.01 DOD Support to Civil SAR, DODD 3025.18, and the DSCA EXORD will apply. b. DODI 3003.01 designates USNORTHCOM as the US Inland SAR Coordinator forthe search and rescue regions (SRR) for the 48 contiguous states and USPACOM for mainland Alaska and Hawaii. The US Air Force provides funding, manpower, and personnel services to operate fully functional rescue coordination centers (RCCs). They promote efficient organization of SAR services and coordinate civil SAR (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67 17operations within the inland US SRRs. The Air Force rescue coordination center (AFRCC) for the 48 contiguous states is located at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. The Alaska rescue coordination center (AKRCC) is located at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. The AFRCC and AKRCC request units to provide SAR assistance; neither can task them. AFRCC and AKRCC do not approve missions; they coordinate them. The USCG is the supported Service for maritime SAR. The USCG maintains RCCs at sector and district headquarters.  c. Frequently, when the AFRCC or AKRCC contacts a unit, the commander willrespond under IRA (depending upon the nature of the distress call). But, IRA is not automatic; the DSCA CARRLL factors and IRA definition still apply. It is DOD policy to support RCC requests for civil SAR, and DOD forces will fund their own activities without allowing cost reimbursement to delay response to any person in danger or distress. Additionally, despite a commander’s IRA, using UASs or ICC for SAR still requires SecDef approval. Confer with the judge advocate for the most up-to-date guidance with regard to UAS employment for SAR missions involving potential loss of life.  7. Operational Constraints and Exceptions to the PCAIn addition to varying levels of approval authorities for DSCA, certain laws and policies constrain the type of support DOD can provide. This section discusses the impact of the PCA and IO policies on DSCA operations. a. PCA. The PCA remains the primary federal statute restricting federal militarysupport to civilian LEAs. The PCA prohibits Title 10, USC forces from engaging in any direct civil law enforcement activities unless constitutional guidance or an Act of Congress exception applies (e.g., the Insurrection Act of 1807). Evidence of criminal activity obtained by DOD personnel in violation of the PCA may be inadmissible in a criminal trial thereby preventing a successful prosecution. Personnel who violate the PCA also may be subject to criminal and civil penalties.  Through federal law and applicable DODDs, the PCA applies to all members (1)of the federal military forces, as well as each of their reserve components serving in a federal status. The USCG, when consisting of Title 14, USC, personnel is authorized to conduct law enforcement activities as part of the USCG mission. (2)Whether the PCA applies to Army or Air NG personnel depends upon the legal authority under which the guardsmen are serving. It is imperative personnel know the various legal restrictions associated with these authorities when engaged in a DSCA operation. One of the following three statutory frameworks order NG personnel to duty: (a)  SAD NG personnel are state funded and under state control. Typically, this is the authority in which NG personnel perform duties when a governor mobilizes the NG to respond to state emergencies, civil disturbances, or disasters, or to perform other duties authorized by state law. The Federal Government, pursuant to a Presidential major disaster or emergency declaration, may reimburse the costs of a SAD response. NG personnel on SAD authority do not fall under PCA restrictions and may perform those law enforcement duties authorized by state law. 18 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015(b)  Title 32, USC, NG personnel are federally funded but remain under the control of the state. Because they fall under state control, they do not fall under PCA restrictions and may perform law enforcement duties authorized by state law. (c)  Title 10, USC NG personnel are federally funded and under federal control; consequently, they are subject to the PCA. Note: Some states may have PCA-like legal restrictions that limit using NG personnel in SAD or Title 32, USC duty status. b. National Emergency Declaration. The POTUS has an inherent authority underArticles II and IV of the Constitution to declare a national emergency. Further, the National Emergency Act of 1976 permits the POTUS to declare an emergency to preserve order and ensure public health and safety during time of war, insurrection, or national crisis. If the POTUS declares a national emergency, the POTUS could issue an executive order waiving PCA restrictions and permitting federalized military forces to perform law enforcement functions to protect federal facilities, property, and personnel. c. Insurrection Act. First, the POTUS must issue a disperse and retire peaceablyproclamation ordering a cessation of unlawful behavior. If the unlawful behavior continues, the Insurrection Act permits the POTUS to use the Armed Forces, including the NG, in federal service (Title 10, USC) to perform law enforcement functions, within a state, to restore law and order under the three following circumstances: When there are unlawful obstructions or rebellions preventing enforcement of An insurrection or domestic violence results in the deprivation of There is an insurrection within a state, and the state legislature or governor, if (1)the laws by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, the POTUS may act unilaterally without a request from state or local authorities. For example, the POTUS used the authority under the Insurrection Act in April 1992 when he ordered federal troops to restore order in Los Angeles during the riots after the Rodney King verdict. (2)the legislature cannot be convened, requests assistance from the POTUS. (3)constitutional rights and the states are unable or unwilling to protect those rights. d. Emergency Situations Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Upon therequest of the US Attorney General, the SecDef may authorize DOD personnel to arrest, search, seize, and conduct any other law enforcement activity to protect persons and property from WMD. For this exception to apply, civilian law enforcement must be unable to enforce the law. e. USCG Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDETs). Under the Maritime Drug LawEnforcement Act, several hundred USCG personnel serve on LEDETs authorized to perform maritime drug interdiction. When engaged in maritime drug interdiction, USCG LEDET personnel may perform traditional law enforcement functions, such as searching vessels, seizing contraband, and arresting suspects upon probable cause. Navy personnel working with the LEDETs are bound by the PCA. Therefore, Navy (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67 19personnel may not perform active, direct law enforcement functions and have a limited supporting role. Indirectly, Navy personnel may assist a LEDET by: Providing force protection for a LEDET boarding party. Transporting a LEDET boarding party to a target vessel.Acting as interpreters. Supplying welding and cutting equipment assistance aboard the target (1)(2)(3)(4)vessel. (5)(6)(7)(8)  Recording the LEDET’s activities while aboard the target vessel.Recovering contraband jettisoned from the target vessel. Effecting damage control to keep the target vessel afloat. Billeting and maintaining persons apprehended from the target vessel. f. Authorized and Restricted Activities in Support of LEA. DODI 3025.21 and Title 10USC 371 authorize sharing information collected during military operations, using military equipment and facilities, training with LEA, and funding and reporting mechanisms for such support. Additionally, they authorize SAR, explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), domestic terrorist incident support, and civil disturbance operations.DODI 3025.21 addresses training with LEA in detail. DOD directives prohibit interdicting vehicles, searches and seizures, arrest, and similar activities (e.g., apprehension, stop, and frisk). Furthermore, engaging in questioning potential witnesses; using force or threats to do so, except in self-defense or defense of others; collecting evidence; forensic testing; and surveillance or pursuit of individuals or vehicles is prohibited. g. Military Courtesy Patrol. A military courtesy patrol conducted in the localcommunity is not considered a PCA violation. To avoid violating the PCA, the military courtesy patrol’s prescribed duties must fall short of law enforcement. Military courtesy patrols are intended to preserve good order and discipline, and to serve as liaisons with local law enforcement, not to actually enforce the law. 8. Intelligence Oversighta. DOD and NG intelligence personnel performing intelligence duties must adhereto federal and DOD IO rules. These include Executive Order 12333, United States Intelligence Activities; DODD 5240.01, DOD Intelligence Activities; and DOD 5240.1-R. In addition, each Service and the NGB has regulations and policy guidance. IO rules ensure intelligence personnel protect US persons’ constitutional rights and privacy, collect essential authorized information by the least intrusive means, and disseminate information only for lawful government purposes. Information may be collected only if it is necessary for conducting a function assigned to the collecting component and if it falls within certain criteria. These criteria include consensual, openly available information; foreign intelligence; counterintelligence; international terrorist activities; international narcotics activities; threats to safety; and overhead and airborne reconnaissance.b. DOD and NG intelligence personnel operating in a Title 10 or Title 32, USC,status must comply with all federal and DOD IO rules, regulations, and directions regarding requirements for authorized activities. Army NG personnel in SAD status 20 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015are prohibited from using DOD intelligence resources (i.e., sensors, systems, equipment, or information) because they are not considered to be operating in aDOD capacity. Thus, Army NG military intelligence personnel (in SAD status) are not authorized to perform any intelligence activities as part of the intelligence community. Military intelligence personnel in SAD status may use state-owned equipment to perform any missions assigned by the governor, within the guidelines of state laws. c. Contractors or non-intelligence personnel assisting in the performance ofintelligence or counterintelligence work on behalf of DOD or NG intelligence have the same IO responsibilities and training requirements as US Government civilian and military intelligence personnel. d. IAA is using intelligence assets for non-intelligence. Within the context of IAAsupport to DSCA operations, the DSCA EXORD authorizes the following IAA tasks: SA, damage assessment, evacuation monitoring, SAR, CBRN assessment, hydrological survey, and dynamic ground coordination. SecDef approval of the DSCA EXORD may authorize traditional intelligence capabilities to conduct DSCA missions for non-intelligence purposes. Use of assets designated to provide IAA for other than the seven IAA missions requires SecDef approval on a case-by-case basis. The DSCA EXORD states CCDRs are authorized to use manned aerial imagery assets, within their area of responsibility (AOR), to obtain imagery of geography (not to observe people or human activity). Questions on whether DODintelligence capabilities may be used in a DSCA operation should be referred to the command judge advocate if the authorities, permissible parameters, and limitations are unclear. All data collection, retention, and dissemination will be performed in accordance with standing DOD intelligence oversight guidance, including any requirement to obtain a proper use memorandum (PUM). Compliance with IO policies will require training personnel and issuing a PUM for manned and unmanned IAA platforms. e. A PUM defines an organization’s request for a domestic imagery requirement andits intended use. It is issued for a one-time event or on an annual basis. A PUM acknowledges awareness of the legal and policy restrictions regarding domestic imagery collection, retention, dissemination, and use. Depending on content, PUMs can be classified or unclassified. The appropriate certifying official verifies and signs the PUM and remains accountable for the accuracy of the domestic imagery request. A legal advisor must conduct a legal sufficiency review of the PUM. The PUM provides an auditable trail of authority and responsibility up to the appropriate levels, while ensuring the protection of the rights of US citizens and organizations. 9. RUFa. In any situation, the standing rules for the use of force (SRUF) assist federalmilitary personnel in determining the application of the appropriate level of force. SRUF are restrictive measures intended to allow only the minimum force necessary to accomplish the mission. US constitutional and domestic law are the bases for SRUF and provide guidance to DOD forces for using force against civilians within (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67 21US territory. See Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff instruction (CJCSI) 3121.01B, Standing Rules for the Use of Force for US Forces, for additional guidance. b. Enclosures L through Q of CJCSI 3121.01B contain the SRUF for US forces.These RUF do not apply to NG forces while on SAD or Title 32, USC status. NG forces operate under the state’s RUF. The SRUF apply during all DSCA and routine military department functions occurring within US territory and territorial seas. Additionally, the SRUF applies to homeland defense missions occurring within US territory and to DOD forces, civilians, and contractors performing law enforcement duties at all DOD installations within or outside US territory.  c. A commander’s authority to modify the SRUF is limited to making the rules more,not less, restrictive. Table 1 contains a template for a commander’s responsibilities under the SRUF. Table 2 contains a SRUF template developed by US Army North.These templates are general in nature and provided as examples only. In coordination with the operational chain of command, commanders and judge advocates must review the actual SRUF. 22 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015Table 1.  Example Commander’s RUF (Title 10 Forces)Teach and Train. A commander must train personnel in the standing rules for the use of force (SRUF)and implement them, when necessary. SRUF trainers must ensure the training does not introduce procedures that effectively restrict the SRUF or introduce tactically dangerous or unsound practices.Unit Self-Defense. A commander retains the inherent right and obligation of unit self-defense and defense of other Department of Defense (DOD) forces in the vicinity, in response to a hostile act or demonstrated hostile intent.Individual Self-Defense. A commander may impose rules of proportionality on individual self-defense. Normally, force is used only as a last resort and should be the minimum necessary. It must be reasonable in intensity, duration, and magnitude to counter the threat ,based on the totality of the circumstances. Lethal force is used only when all lesser means have failed or cannot be reasonably employed. Coordinate SRUF. A commander will coordinate the SRUF with civilian law enforcement agencies (CLEAs) or security forces, when operating with them, to ensure a common understanding. Any RUF issues, which cannot be resolved, will be forwarded to the Secretary of Defense (SecDef) through the chain of command and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Imminent Threat. A commander will determine if a threat of death or serious bodily harm by an individual or motor vehicle is imminent based on an assessment of all of the circumstances. If thecommander determines such a threat is imminent, lethal force is authorized to stop the threat.Inherently Dangerous Property. A commander may designate DOD property, or property having a DOD nexus, as inherently dangerous. This includes weapons, ammunition, explosives, portable missiles, rockets, chemical agents, and special nuclear materials.Pursue and Recover. A commander may not authorize forces to pursue and recover a stolen asset vital to national security or inherently dangerous property unless delegated this authority by the Commander, United States Northern Command (CDRUSNORTHCOM) and CLEAs, or when security forces are not reasonably available. Any pursuit must be immediate and uninterrupted.Changes To SRUF. A commander may augment the SRUF, as necessary, by submitting requests for mission specific RUF to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for approval by the SecDef.Violations. A commander will immediately report any suspected violation of or noncompliance with the SRUF through the chain of command to CDRUSNORTHCOM. (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67 23Table 2.  Example RUF Card Template (Title 10 Forces)Unit Self-Defense. Commanders always retain the inherent right and obligation to exercise unit self-defense in response to a hostile act or demonstrated hostile intent. This includes the defense of other DOD forces in the vicinity.Individual Self-Defense. Service members may exercise individual self-defense in response to a hostile act or demonstrated hostile intent. A commander may impose rules of proportionality on individual self-defense. Normally, force is used only as a last resort and should be the minimum necessary. It must be reasonable in intensity, duration, and magnitude to counter the threat, based on the totality of the circumstances. Lethal force is used only when all lesser means have failed or cannot be reasonably employed. SRUF training must introduce procedures that effectively restrict tactically dangerous or unsound practices.De-escalation. When time and circumstances permit, Service members will give individuals a warning and an opportunity to withdraw or stop the threatening actions before using force. Avoid confrontation with individuals who pose no threat to the unit, non-DOD persons in the vicinity, or property secured by DOD forces. If a confrontation appears likely, civilians are acting in a suspicious manner, or it is immediately after a confrontation, notify civilian law enforcement agencies (CLEAs) or security agency personnel as soon as practical.Limitations on the Use of Force. Service members will use force of any kind only as a last resort. If used, the force should be the minimum necessary to accomplish the mission. Any use of force must be reasonable in intensity, duration, and magnitude to counter the threat based on all the circumstances.Exercise due regard for the safety of innocent bystanders when using any type of force. Warning shots are not authorized.Use of Nonlethal Force. Service members may use nonlethal force to stop a threat, when it is reasonable to:(cid:120) Control a situation and accomplish the mission.(cid:120) Provide protection for self and other DOD personnel.(cid:120) Defend non-DOD persons in the vicinity, if directly related to the assigned mission.(cid:120) Defend designated protected property.Lethal Force in Self-Defense, Defense of Others, and Defense of Property. Service members may use lethal force to stop a threat only when all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be employed, and it appears necessary to:(cid:120) Protect DOD forces when a commander believes a person poses an imminent threat of death orserious bodily harm.(cid:120) Protect non-DOD persons in the vicinity from the imminent threat of death or serious bodilyharm, if directly related to the assigned mission.(cid:120) Prevent the theft or sabotage of assets vital to national security, national critical infrastructure, orinherently dangerous property.Lethal Force is Not Authorized. Lethal force is not authorized to disperse a crowd, stop looting, enforce a curfew, or protect nondesignated property. 24 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 Table 2.  Example RUF Card Template (Title 10 Forces) (cont’d)Lethal Force Against a Serious Offense. Service members may use lethal force, if it is directly related to the assigned mission and appears necessary to:(cid:120) Prevent a serious crime against any person, which involves imminent threat of death or seriousbodily harm.(cid:120) Prevent the escape of a prisoner where probable cause indicates the prisoner committed orattempted to commit a serious offense and would pose an imminent threat of death or seriousbodily harm to DOD forces or others in the vicinity.(cid:120) Arrest or apprehend a person who, there is probable cause to believe, has committed a seriousoffense that involved an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm or sabotage ofdesignated protected property.Lethal Force Against a Vehicular Threat. Service members may fire their weapons at a moving land or water vehicle when they believe the vehicle poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm to DOD forces or to non-DOD persons in the vicinity, if doing so is related to the assigned mission.Inspection of Personnel Entering and Exiting an Area. Per command security guidance, Service members may inspect individuals and property prior to granting persons or property entry inside a DOD perimeter or secured area and upon leaving such an area. An individual or item of property, which doesnot meet the command security requirements for entry may be denied access inside a DOD perimeter or secured area.Temporary Detention of Threatening Personnel. Service members may detain an individual temporarily, if the individual:(cid:120) Gains unauthorized access inside DOD perimeters or other secured areas and refuses to departsuch an area after being denied further access.(cid:120) Otherwise threatens the safety and security of DOD forces, property secured by DOD forces, ornon-DOD persons in the vicinity, if related to the assigned mission.Detained Individuals. Detained individuals, vehicles, and property may be searched as a protection measure. Detained individuals and any secured property will be released to CLEA at the earliest opportunity, consistent with mission accomplishment.Pursuit and Recovery of Stolen Property. Forces are not authorized to pursue and recover a stolen asset vital to national security or inherently dangerous property, unless delegated this authority by the Commander, United States Northern Command and CLEA or security forces are not reasonably available. Any pursuit must be immediate, continuous, and uninterrupted. Report Violations of the SRUF. Immediately, Service members will report any violation of or non-compliance with the SRUF concerning who, what, when, where, and why to the chain of command, Inspector General, Judge Advocate, or any commissioned officer.Legend:USC—United States Code(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67 25d. The SRUF and RUF may differ for each state’s NG forces. State laws govern theRUF of the NG serving in a state-controlled, Title 32, USC, or SAD status. Additionally, the NG’s authority to perform law enforcement, law enforcement support, or security operations varies in the laws of the various states. Depending on the language of the state statutes involved, grants of, or limitations on, the NG’s authority to act as police officers may apply to NG personnel in a Title 32, USCstatus, SAD status, or both. Some states grant NG members (in a Title 32, USC status, SAD status, or both) the authority of police officers, while others only authorize those powers enjoyed by the population at large, such as citizen’s arrest. Consequently, each of the states, territories, and the District of Columbia promulgate separate RUF. While coordinating with state legal authorities, it is the duty of the NG judge advocate to tailor the RUF to the particular mission and policies of the state. The template in table 3 provides a planning aid for deploying forces. Prior to the assumption of any DSCA mission, commanders in Title 32, USC, or SAD status must ensure all personnel are briefed on the applicable state RUF. Table 3.  Example RUF Card Template (Title 32 and SAD NG Forces)Minimum Force: Military personnel will use the minimum force required to accomplish the mission.Self-Defense. Nothing in these rules for the use of force (RUF) shall limit a commander’s inherent duty to safeguard the force or an individual‘s inherent right of self-defense. Proportional to the threat, an individual is always authorized and expected to use necessary force in self-defense. A commander may impose rules of proportionality on individual self-defense. Lethal Force. Lethal force refers to physical force, which could reasonably result in death, whether or not death is the intent. In all cases, discharging a firearm is considered lethal force. Before resorting to lethal force, all of the following conditions must be met.(cid:120) All other means have been exhausted, are not appropriate, or are not reasonably available(including restraining, detaining, and subduing).(cid:120) The use of lethal force does not increase the risk of death or serious bodily harm to innocentbystanders.Lethal force may be used for one or more of the following circumstances.(cid:120) Self-defense to avoid death or serious bodily harm. Threat of harm is not restricted to firearms.It may include assault with large rocks, bricks, pipes, or other heavy missiles, incendiary andexplosive devices, or any other material, which could be expected to cause death or seriousbodily harm.(cid:120) Prevention of crime involving a substantial risk of death or very serious bodily harm, includingthe defense of others.(cid:120) Detention or prevention of the escape of a person, who during detention, or in the act ofescape, threatens to kill or cause serious bodily harm to others. Attempt to escape does notjustify the use of lethal force. Use of lethal force is justified only when it is immediatelynecessary to protect against death or serious bodily harm.(cid:120) Lethal force will be used to stop immediate threats, not to warn them. Warning shots andblanks are not authorized.26 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015Table 3.

Planning Considerations in the DSCA EnvironmentThe joint operation planning process supports missions across the full range of military operations. Chapter 3 of JP 5-0, Joint Operation Planning, describes the planning process. Further planning information is provided in Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual 3130.03, Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) Planning Formats and Guidance.For Service-specific processes, see: a. Naval warfare publication (NWP) 5-01, Navy Planning.b. Army doctrine reference publication (ADRP) 5-0, The Operations Process.c. Marine Corps warfighting publication (MCWP) 5-1, Marine Corps PlanningProcess. d. Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution.e. Commandant of the Coast Guard instruction Manual (CIM), 3010.13B,Contingency Preparedness Planning Manual, Volume III- Exercises. 2. Mission Analysisa. The key inputs to mission analysis are the higher headquarters planningdirective, strategic guidance, information about the incident and the affected operational environment, and initial staff estimates. The primary products of mission analysis are the mission statement, the commander’s initial intent statement, the commander’s critical information requirements (CCIRs), and planning guidance. In preparation for the mission analysis process, staff officers should develop a generic list of requirements within their functional areas for particular types of missions. During DSCA, the RFA process links missions and assignments. Mission analysis of these assignments will result in fragmentary orders (FRAGORDs), passed down from higher headquarters via the JTF. Within these FRAGORDs, the JTF and task force commanders must translate civil authority requirements into an order understood by supporting tactical commanders tasked with execution. These orders are commonly in the form of an ICS Incident Action Plan or outlined in a state ICS 204 Form. Figure 8 shows a generic example of a state ICS 204 Form. If available, include this form as an attachment or enclosure to the FRAGORD tasking the subordinate tactical unit. b. Coordinate and integrate federal agency support operations with state and localgovernment agencies. On-going military operations and homeland defense requirements have priority over DSCA operations unless otherwise directed. The severity and magnitude of the event and the requirements of DSCA operations determine the duration and scope of DOD involvement.

During the initial stages of disaster response, facilities may be completely orpartially dysfunctional. After conducting immediate lifesaving activities, restoring airports, ports, and staging areas is one of the most essential tasks and a critical response capability of the DOD. These facilities allow response forces and specialized equipment access to the affected area. b. Airport, harbor, and marine channel support operations may involve clearing orsalvaging ships, aircraft, piers, marine railways, bridges, or other damaged structures blocking runways, air terminal access, harbors, and marine shipping channels. Units tasked in these operations include mobile air traffic control units, the US Air Force rapid engineer deployable heavy operational repair squadron, and Navy salvage assets, such as mobile diving and salvage units and salvage ships. c. To the maximum extent possible, DOD forces will use DOD facilities for realestate needs. Units should not occupy private land or facilities without specific legal authority. The General Services Administration, US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Naval Facilities Engineering Command, or other Government agencies provide real property support. d. Airports and Operations.Often, an airport requires a rapid, post-disaster assessment before declaringThe JFC normally tasks the joint force air component commander (JFACC) to(1)it safe and open for emergency operations. Therefore, an early priority is adisaster effects survey of existing airfields to determine if they are safe andcapable of conducting emergency operations. After being declared operational bya civil authority, survey runways, taxiways, aprons, and navigational aids as soonas possible. See appendix C for an airfield planning survey.Disaster response operations involve numerous aircraft, from military and(2)civilian organizations, flying into the affected area. Thus, it is essential to getairfields partially operational as soon as possible. Local and wide-area air trafficcontrol procedures provide safe air traffic routing within the response area to andfrom landing zones and airports.(3)function as the airspace control authority. The airspace control authority willdevelop an airspace control plan, integrated with the Federal AviationAdministration (FAA), to be executed via an airspace control order. The airspacecontrol order implements specific control procedures for established time periods.Planners in the joint air tasking process will develop airspace control instructionsin sufficient detail to allow planning and execution of all air missions listed in theair tasking order.(4)(5)air traffic control rules and routes in the affected area.(6)ship-borne systems to close within territorial waters to assist aircraft in collisionOperation of UAS in a disaster area requires SecDef and FAA approval.Helicopter operations and response agency flight operations have priority forDepending on equipment capabilities at airports, it may be necessary for(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67 31The JTF commander shall establish an air terminal operations center (ATOC) avoidance and navigation in bad weather. Land-sea interface and other terrain factors may affect shipboard radars. (7)to manage the site’s air logistic support operations. The ATOC acts as an interface among the advanced logistic support site and the battle force logistics coordinator, US Air Force Air Mobility Command, and the naval air logistics office. The ATOC receives, processes, and dispatches all information relating to air logistics to each functional area at the advanced logistic support site. Flight operations consist of ground handling of aircraft, providing passenger (8)services, and unloading and loading cargo and mail. The ramp controller is the primary interface between the flight line and the ATOC, ensuring all personnel working on the ramp adhere to directions and ATOC guidance. e. Sea Ports and Sea Basing.Port opening is a joint operation coordinated through local officials and theSeaports must be surveyed to determine if they are safe and capable ofNatural and manmade events impact harbor navigation, aids to navigation,(1)JTF port opening element, working to support the USCG COTP.

Normally, before the portopens for emergency operations, the USCG, USACE, or civilian contractorsshould perform a rapid post-disaster assessment. The USCG COTP determinesif the port is open for emergency operations. Operations include harbor andmarine channel clearance; salvage of ships, piers, marine railways, and bridges;and other structural repairs affecting marine shipping channel operations.Depending upon the type and scale of the situation, wrecks and debris at astrategic access point could affect a substantial geographic area. The Navy hasadditional survey and salvage capabilities, including the USN Supervisor ofSalvage and Diving, fleet survey teams, salvage ships, mobile diving and salvageunits, and associated commercial salvage contractors.(3)conducting emergency operations.

NCHBs have C2 for handling operations andproviding support personnel to discharge and load ships (either pier side or in-stream) for all classes of cargo, including HAZMAT. They conduct port terminaloperations in developed or undeveloped ports, including discharging and loadingcontainers, cargo, and vehicles from ships.

Units assigned to terminal battalions include watercraft units,harbormaster detachments, and seaport operations companies. Army watercraftunits provide vessels to support movement of cargo, equipment, and personnel inArmy terminal battalions are employed in fixed ports, unimproved ports, and32 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 shallow coastal and inland waterways. Harbormaster detachments provide mobile, joint, interoperable communications to support 24 hour operational control for vessels conducting intra-theater lift, water terminal, inland waterway, and joint amphibious and riverine operations. Army seaport operations companies perform seaport terminal service operations to conduct shipboard and pier-side discharge and loading of bulk cargo and vehicles.(a)  Mission Command. The transportation brigade (expeditionary) serves as the mission command and planning headquarters for Army watercraft and port terminal operations. The harbormaster C2 center provides theater-wide communications and common operating picture capability. (b)  Landing Craft. The Army has several types of landing craft capable of operations within the littorals and inland waterways and provides access to small, austere ports, harbors, and beaches. Logistics support vessels and landing crafts, utility are self-deployable assets capable of carrying tracked and wheeled vehicles, containers, and oversized equipment. (c)  Terminal Operations. The Army can support the full range of capabilities needed to run a small to medium-sized seaport. The Army has small and large tug boats used for port maintenance, salvage, and routine husbandry requirements. Additionally, the Army has organizations required to load and unload strategic lift assets, stage and marshal cargo, and clear port facilities. Disasters impact shore facilities, transportation corridors, and ports requiring (6)sea basing to support response operations ashore. Ships and ship-based aircraft provide essential C2, medical, survey, SAR, support, and response operations. Sea basing is valuable for disasters in low-lying areas where road, rail, and airports are underwater or inaccessible due to damage. Large naval amphibious ships with rotary wing landing platforms are ideal for sea basing operations, as they can support sustained operations independent of land facilities. Damaged or nonexistent port facilities may require using specialized landing craft, utility andlanding craft, air cushion to conduct logistics missions.  (7)maintain additional capabilities to conduct maritime support with a variety of large and small vessels. One of these is the transportation of bulk materials, vehicles, and fuel from large ships to the shore, independent of port facilities, using joint logistics over-the-shore capabilities. These services bring a tremendous capability to impacted areas, but take weeks to establish. (8)operation as possible. They quickly arrive with critical mass, commence response support and sustain operations indefinitely. Damaged or destroyed shore infrastructure does not deter naval forces from providing C2, lift, and reconnaissance. Sea lines of communication provide an important bridge until other DOD, government, or civilian agencies can organize and establish operations.  In littoral environments, naval forces establish a sea base as close to the Military Sealift Command, the Maritime Administration, and the Army 4. Reception, Staging, Onward Movement, and Integration (RSOI)Establish RSOI, as soon as practical, in the operational area to receive all forces. DSCA operations require all operating forces to receive additional guidance and briefings. This (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67 33includes legal guidance on the constraints of the domestic environment, associated RUF, commander’s communication strategy for potential contact with media, and safety briefs. Safety considerations include hazard identification and individual protective equipment (IPE) and personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements based on specifics of the incident. Deconflict DOD RSOI with state EMAC RSOIs. 5. Developing SAa. Media reports, local DOD activities, and government agencies may provide easyaccess to photographs and news reports. This may enable a hasty analysis of the situation, enabling direct support by responding forces. Official websites (e.g., FEMA) contain policies, reference materials, and information about organizations involved in the area along with contacts. Representative Service EPLOs can assist in developing SA for their Service units, and can facilitate coordination with the Service component headquarters, and other Service resources. Additionally, EPLOs have a community-wide chat capability to leverage for exchanging information. b. The commander’s estimate of the situation is an analysis and establishes theappropriate course of action. In DSCA operations, the estimate further develops SA critical in providing operational support. Areas of particular emphasis include: Identifying factors affecting area access, including supplying and re-supplying Identifying environmental conditions (e.g., geography, meteorology, and other Identifying capabilities and limitations of federal, state, and other participants Determining communications capabilities and connectivity within the area of (1)material. (2)factors) affecting operational planning, C2, and force employment. (3)operations. (4)regarding national policy, public affairs guidance, and legal restrictions. (5)Identifying cultural and local language factors affecting the common understanding of the situation. (6)infrastructure and capability. (7)(8)Determining the safety of navigation for water access. Obtaining an infrastructure assessment. Determining the health status of the population and the remaining healthcare c. Understanding the perception of the DOD’s actions and the FederalGovernment’s response by the local government and population is a key element in the development of SA. Commanders need to align their communication strategy with federal response leadership. They must remain engaged with all sources (e.g., media and local authorities) and make necessary changes to develop, promote, and sustain unity of effort and public trust. This should correct misunderstandings or unrealistic expectations regarding the military’s role in the operation. Timing of the call-up is a key factor. At the outset, commanders must determine and communicate the military’s role, termination and transfer criteria, and a transition plan. Commanders must address expectations as the operation progresses. The correct and standardized use of terms is critical in DSCA operations. Make every effort to use commonly understood terminology that does not hamper coordination with state 34 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015and local officials, NGOs, or international organizations. For example, avoid incorrectly using the terms refugee, displaced person, and evacuee, which have legal and unintended connotations. d. Short duration DSCA operations focusing on minimizing human suffering andstabilizing the situation are ideal, such as SAR and recovery efforts during the crisis stage. Once the situation stabilizes, state and local governments assume the functions performed by the federal interagency and NG responders. Identify these transition plans and transfer points early. 6. Operational Concept and Initial PlanningDuring the initial response phase, local, tribal, state, private sector, and federal partners and FEMA collaborate on mission assignments supplementing on-scene and civilian capabilities. See appendix C for task force assignments during the initial response phase. 7. Evacuation ConsiderationsEvacuation order authority rests with civilian agencies. DOD units provide critical logistical and medical support for evacuation operations. DOD involvement in civilian evacuations demands a clear understanding of the specific operational requirements and legal ramifications. The appropriate agency coordinates evacuation areas and collection points, proper medical care, food, water, and shelter. See appendix C for planning considerations for a military assisted evacuation. 8. Communications and Planning Factorsa. Communications support is critical to successful disaster assistance operations.Often, disasters disable or destroy local communications systems, including cellular capabilities. Expect military organizations to extend communication capability to non-DOD disaster response task force partners. b. DSCA operations demand timely action and interoperability of diverse groups(e.g., military, federal, and civilian entities). The ICS requires unclassified communications in clear text. Prioritize clarity over security when employing traditional military communications, security paradigms, and jargon. c. There are three main levels of voice communications planning: C2 nets’ satellitecommunications/high frequency (SATCOM/HF), tactical C2 nets’ ultrahigh/very high frequency (UHF/VHF), and tactical operational nets. Operation orders (OPORDs) and special instructions provide frequency plans to support participants. To ensure maximum interoperability, the airspace control plan assigns frequencies. d. As an overarching goal, data communications planning should emphasize easeof operability and availability of information to all participants. The goal of information management for DSCA operations is the timely flow of critical information toenhance a DSCA force commander’s SA. Also, these information networks must be interoperable with NG forces executing DSCA. e. C2 architecture planning considerations identify:(1)Required reports and reporting frequency.(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67 35Classification levels.

(6)(7)Strategic communications plans. Unique challenges communications units have in the DSCA environment. f. SAR communications planning integrates all participating agencies, includingaircraft, maritime, and ground assets. Large-scale SAR operations may require additional forward operating bases.

C2 systems should support immediate information exchange for: (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)Coordinating communications. Coordinating the local law enforcement response. Coordinating medical support. Disseminating higher headquarters’ directives. Disseminating primary agency or JTF phone numbers and frequencies. Coordinating reports. h. Immediately, alert and deploy airborne C2 to the incident site, to SAR andemergency medical services, through the ICS. Military fixed-wing capabilities can support airborne C2 mission requirements and relay orders to rescue units to ensure expeditious life-saving operations. 36 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015COMMANDER AND STAFF DEFENSE SUPPORT OF CIVIL AUTHORITIES MISSION CONSIDERATIONS Chapter IV 1. OverviewThis chapter highlights specific planning considerations of DOD components supporting a DSCA mission. It is not an all-inclusive checklist. DSCA operation considerations include the following. a. Assessment, Preparation, and Mobilization. These considerations begin with allpre-incident actions; continue through post-notification, pre-deployment actions; and end at deployment. b. Deployment. These considerations begin with deployment of forces and end withcommencement of operations. c. Support of Civil Authorities. These considerations begin with the first operationalactions, upon arrival at the incident area and conclude when operations begin to draw down and there are no future mission requirements. d. Redeployment and Demobilization. These considerations begin when operationsstart to draw down and conclude with the successful and complete transition and release of personnel at their home station. 2. Tactical Level Leadershipa.

Determine disengagement criteria if in an IRA situation. b. Deployment Considerations.(1)  Prepare a HAZMAT strategy.Develop RSOI procedures.(2)Determine information requirements. They help commanders and staffs(3)understand the adversary; operational environment; and status of agencies,units, and installations. Appendix C provides examples of possible informationrequirements.Identify a base support installation (BSI), which is normally a DOD installation(4)with an airfield and suitable support facilities. The BSI is the domestic equivalentof a theater base in an AOR. It may be the aerial port of embarkation (APOE) orseaport of embarkation (SPOE) and may become the RSOI facility for jointforces. Additionally, it may serve as a training facility and principal supportingbase for federal response efforts. CDRUSNORTHCOM or CDRUSPACOMdesignates the BSI after receiving concurrence from the owning MilitaryDepartment’s secretary. Not all states have a DOD facility capable of handlingmilitary or heavy commercial aircraft. Therefore, RSOI may require use of acivilian site.Note: Do not assume private or public property is available for military purposes. c. Redeployment and demobilization considerations.Develop a closeout and redeployment plan with JFHQ, DCO, DCE, or JTF.Compile all data from support operations with DCE or NGB.

Intelligencea. Assessment, Preparation, and Mobilization Considerations.Note: In a DSCA environment, do not use the terms intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance or intelligence preparation of the battlespace. The appropriate terminology is IAA, at the tactical level, and operational environment assessment, at the operational level. (1)Gathering information on weather, roads, environmental factors, and the incident is legal and necessary. However, in accordance with DOD 5240.1-R, DOD and NG intelligence personnel may only collect and retain information pertaining to a US person when there is a specific mission and authority to do so. It is important that DOD personnel know to report all information regarding illegal activities to the appropriate civilian law enforcement agency (CLEA).

As a rule, do not use DOD intelligence capabilities, resources, and personnel for activities other than foreign intelligence or counter-intelligence, unless specifically approved by the SecDef. For SA, planning purposes, or upon receipt of validated mission assignment, use NG intelligence community personnel and non-intelligence equipment in a Title 32, USC or SAD status to fulfill TAG requirements. Due to potential violations of the PCA through direct DOD support to CLEAs, closely review and separately process requests for military support to CLEAs for approval. Process support requests according to DODI 3025.21, and DOD 5240.1-R, Procedure 12. (b)  File an approved PUM with the appropriate approval authority before tasking airborne platforms to collect domestic imagery. In the event of an emergency where USNORTHCOM is the designated lead DOD operational authority, comply with proper use provisions by coordinating related requests for domestic imagery from airborne platforms with USNORTHCOM. Refer toappendix B for further guidance on IAA requests. (c)  When NG forces are in Title 32, USC Status, the JFHQ-J2 will work with the remote sensing community, including local, state, and federal agencies, to identify IAA requirements and available IAA assets to ensure unity of effort. Coordinate unsatisfied requirements between the JFHQ-J2 and NG-J2 via a J2 coordination cell.

Civil Authority Information SupportDuring DSCA operations, military information support (MIS) forces can be employed to conduct civil authority information support element (CAISE) activities to provide public information and disaster relief messaging to affected populations. CAISE activities are executed only under the direction and authority of a designated lead federal agency or civil authority. When executing CAISE operations, MIS forces are restricted by policy and SecDef guidance to only broadcasting and disseminating public information. The lead federal agency PAO, incident PAO, or the joint information center (as part of the ESF-15 office) provide and coordinate message content. When authorized, MIS forces use their media development, production, and dissemination capabilities to create and deliver approved messages. a.

PAO and PIOa. It is the responsibility of local and state officials to provide information anddirections to the public (e.g., evacuation procedures). Each state determines who has the authority to provide directions to the public (i.e., the sheriff, mayor, or judge). Note: DOD agencies may assist the appropriate authorities with disseminating properly attributed information (e.g., “The mayor has directed a mandatory evacuation for the city.”).b. Normally, general information to the public about the event will come from theincident PAO, press, PIO, or the joint information center. Supporting agencies may assist in disseminating this information, but are limited to providing specific information only about actions of their agency. For DOD, this means limiting public affairs activities to supporting the primary agency or focusing on the actions of DOD to support the incident. DOD public affairs activities will not place DOD in the forefront. DOD is a partner and participant in the incident response. c. The PAO is responsible for ensuring military personnel are aware of the potentialconsequences associated with questionable behavior on camera or speaking to the media without authorization. Encourage PAOs to complete on-line training at the FEMA website. 52 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015d.

Religious Supporta. Military religious ministry personnel provide religious support as part of a religioussupport team (RST). Primarily, the RST deploys to provide religious support to authorized DOD personnel, including military members, their families, and other authorized DOD civilians (assigned and contracted). b. Currently, DOD interpretation of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution andDOD legal guidance prohibit chaplains from providing religious support to the civilian population. However, rare and catastrophic, large-scale disasters may overwhelm local and state capabilities. In these situations RSTs may serve as liaisons to NGOs and faith-based organizations when authorized by the IC. c.

Note: Refer to JP 4-02, Health Service Support, for a description of the JTF surgeon's responsibilities. Due to the numerous categories of patients requiring treatment, medical (4)providers should understand medical eligibility guidelines to ensure patients have proper access to care. The medical eligibility for care criteria defines when amilitary medical provider may treat civilian patients and when civilian providers may treat military personnel. A determination of eligibility is made at the highest level possible with SJA support.  Note: Title 32, USC forces differ from Title 10, USC with regard to medical paperwork,records, and tracking. The Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946 and the Medical Malpractice Immunity (5)Act of 1976 (known as the Gonzalez Act) provide protection for DOD health care providers.

DOD EOD provides DSCA under IRA to assist local, state, and federal authoritiesto save lives and prevent damage to critical infrastructure and key resources. EOD assists in mitigating, rendering safe, and disposing suspected or detected unexploded ordnance, damaged or deteriorated explosives, explosive ordnance or munitions, or an improvised explosive device. Additionally, EOD aid manages other potentially explosive material or harmful military munitions creating an imminent threat to public safety. b. The local EOD’s immediate response is 2 to 6 hours. However, should theresponse exceed 72 hours (e.g., a sustained bombing campaign response) appropriate authorities should submit an official RFA. The initial EOD response may evolve into a larger and more complex event after assessing the situation. EOD teams responding under IRA are usually self-sufficient for short periods of time.62 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015Long duration operations may increase support and logistics requirements from the incident command. c. US Navy EOD has specific requirements when conducting underwater operationsand is the only Service EOD that performs underwater render safe procedures and EOD dive operations. In addition to any potential HAZMAT requirements associated with diving equipment and gases, these dive operations have unique logistics, personnel, and mobility support requirements. Establish contact as soon as possible to ascertain their specific requirements. d.

OverviewMilitary units tasked to support the civil authority during domestic disasters provide effective disaster response capabilities to limit loss of life, mitigate suffering, and curtail significant property damage. This chapter will address the commonality of planning deployment, execution, and redeployment of forces in support of wildland fires, wind storms, earthquakes, floods, winter storms, CBRN incidents, special events, and cyberspace-related incidents. 2. Wildland Firefightinga. A wildland fire is a nonstructure fire occurring in an area with little development,except for roads, railroads, power lines, and transportation facilities. b. Authorities governing wildland fire responses include: IRA, mutual aidagreements, Presidential directives, and SecDef approved RFA from a primary agency.  c. The state will use all its assets and execute a MOU and EMAC with other statesbefore requesting any Federal military assistance. d. The following relate to the federal response.NIFC is the nation’s support center for wildland firefighting. A 2005 anWhen requested, the DOD provides military resources to support ground and(1)interagency agreement among DOD, US Department of Agriculture (USDA), andDepartment of the Interior provides guidelines, terms, and request processes forwildland firefighting support.(2)aerial fire suppression efforts. The US Air Force and Air NG operate aircraftequipped with modular airborne firefighting systems owned by the US ForestService.(3)when a wildland fire exceeds local, state, and NIFC capabilities.(4)people, plus their C2 elements, for a total of approximately 250 personnel.(5)missions may take direction from the IC. Tasking cannot conflict with DODpolicies and priorities.NIFC may request DOD personnel to act as ground firefighting hand crewsUnlike other DSCA operations, deployed personnel in wildland firefightingDOD resources for ground firefighting form 10 type II ground crews of 20e. For additional information, contact the Military Liaison Officer at the NationalInteragency Coordination Center, located at NIFC, in Boise, Idaho, at (208) 387-5815. 3. Wind Storms (Tropical Cyclones, Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Tornadoes)a. The main hazards associated with hurricanes are storm surges, high winds,heavy rain, flooding, and tornadoes. The intensity of a hurricane, indicated by the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, predicts its damage potential. (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67 65b. A strong tornado can destroy buildings and create a damage path as much as amile wide. Wind speeds can top 300 miles per hour. c. A storm surge is an abnormal rise in the level of the sea along a coast caused bythe onshore winds of a severe cyclone, hurricane, or typhoon. d. Hurricane winds not only damage structures, but the barrage of debris they carrycan be dangerous. Damaging winds begin well before the hurricane eye makes landfall. e. Some secondary effects of wind and water destruction are electrical poweroutages, disruption of utilities, water supply contamination, dam failure, fires, and chemical spills. Flood waters may contain hazardous waste. f. A major hurricane or tornado could cause residents to relocate and requireshelter, food, and water. Implement evacuation plans in advance of hurricane landfall. g. The IC may receive mission assignments to provide the following resources:Debris clearance.Transportation of first responders, evacuees, injured, medically fragile, or(1)(2)special needs populations.(3)Health care providers.Air assets for SAR and personnel transport and recovery.(4)(5)Logistical support (e.g., bedding, food, water, generators, and medicalsupplies).(6)  (7)(8)(9)(10)  response teams.(11)  Temporary shelter and staging base.Key infrastructure assessment by the USACE.Heavy equipment and operators.Shoring and structural reinforcement.Fatality search and recovery teams supporting disaster mortuary operationalSecurity and law enforcement according to the PCA.h.

Earthquakesa. An earthquake is movement, sudden and along a geologic fault, resulting inrelease of accumulated strain within or along the edge of one or more of the earth’s tectonic plates. Earthquakes have potential to cause massive damage and extensive casualties. b. Aftershocks follow large earthquakes. Aftershocks can be quite large and causeweakened structures to collapse or suffer further damage. c. A tsunami is a sea wave caused by an underwater earthquake, landslide, orvolcanic eruption. Earthquake induced tsunamis advance onshore at great speeds, resulting in drowning deaths and severe damage to or destruction of inundated structures. See paragraph 5 in this chapter for additional information. d. Secondary hazards of earthquakes include:(1)  (2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)Fires.Transportation infrastructure and utility impact.Water contamination and service disruption.Electrical power interruptions.Gas leaks and service interruptions.Communications systems interruption and overload.Building collapse.Dam and reservoir failure.Hazardous materials spills.e. Regardless of preparation by the local government, a major earthquake willoverwhelm its ability to respond. A supporting commander may receive the following resource requests: Transporting first responders, evacuees, displaced personnel, and injured, Logistical support (e.g., bedding, food, water, generators, and medical (1)medically fragile, or special needs populations.

Floods are grouped into the following types: riverine flooding, urban drainage,ground failures, fluctuating lake levels, coastal flooding and erosion, surface runoff, overbank flooding of rivers, flash flooding, dam and levee failure, and ice jam flooding. b. All floods are unique. Some floods develop slowly. Flash floods develop quickly,sometimes in just a few minutes and without any visible signs of rain in the immediate area. c. Flood terminology.A flood warning advises when flooding occurs or is imminent in the warningA flood watch advises when high flow or overflow of water from a river is(1)possible within a given time period. It can apply to heavy runoff or drainage ofwater into low-lying areas. These watches are issued for flooding expected tooccur at least six hours after heavy rains end.(2)area.A flash flood watch advises when flash flooding is possible in or close to the(3)watch area. Generally, flood watches are issued for expected flooding within sixhours after heavy rains end.(4)warning area resulting from torrential rains, dam failure, or ice jam.(5)land areas along the coast within the next 12 to 36 hours.A coastal flood warning advises when land areas along the coast expect to(6)become, or have become, inundated by sea water above the typical tide action.A flash flood warning advises when a flash flood occurs or is imminent in theA coastal flood watch advises when the possibility exists for the inundation of68 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015d. Effects of flooding on the civilian population may include displacement andcasualties. e. Flood missions may require military-specific skills and equipment, including:Assessing damage to roads, bridges, structures, and utilities.Supporting SAR operations with personnel and equipment.Conducting topographic surveys for the extent of flood damage.Overlaying maps to depict damage, water levels, key facilities, and SAROpening roadways for emergency and medical traffic.Constructing temporary bridges.Clearing debris and mud.Restoring critical facilities, services, and utilities.Demolishing unsafe structures.Providing emergency power and restoring power to critical facilities.Providing expedient repair of critical distribution systems.Enforcing the law according to the PCA.Supporting evacuation of seriously ill or injured patients to hospitals or(1)(2)(3)(4)activities.(5)(6)(7)  (8)(9)(10)  (11)  (12)  (13)  medical care facilities.(14)  (15)  animals.(16)  (17)  (18)  (19)  emergency services personnel.(20)  electrical power generation, and logistical support operations.Disposing diseased animals based upon USDA guidance.Cleaning and disinfecting vehicles, equipment, and facilities.Setting up temporary staging and storage areas.Constructing temporary shelters for disaster responders, civilians, andMoving animal carcasses for burning or burial.Assisting with transporting equipment, response personnel, and affectedConstructing temporary sites for medical support, communications,f. Flood Hazards and Safety Considerations.Flood waters pose an extreme electrocution hazard. Do not enter flooded (1)areas without assessing the risk due to downed power lines and submerged electrical components. Additionally, water and electricity may combine to produce an elevated risk of structure fires. (2)(3)(4)protective clothing. Double gloving with a waterproof glove under a heavy work glove is the best (5)way to protect the hands from cuts, scrapes, and floodwater exposure. Use boots and rain gear to prevent lower body skin exposure. Floodwaters obscure ground conditions, causing loss of footing and falls. Unless authorities declare them safe, assume floodwaters are not safe. Before entering floodwaters, put on plastic or rubber gloves, boots, and other (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67 69Avoid working alone and wear a USCG-approved life jacket or buoyant work (6)vest when entering flood waters or working over or near flood waters. (7)Use appropriate insect repellent. (8)Do not handle displaced animals. Wild and domesticated animals will seek shelter in unusual places to avoid cold, wet, or windy weather. Contact animal control specialists for help. (9)notify a medical examiner or the chain of command. In the event of discovering deceased persons, leave the remains in place and 6. Winter Stormsa. Snow, sleet, freezing rain, and ice are the elements, which constitute hazardouswinter storms. b. Related effects of winter storms include flooding, downed power lines, anddisrupted services. Additionally, freezing conditions may cause broken or burst water lines, burst or ruptured pipelines and tanks containing hazardous materials, debris from fallen trees and limbs, and restricted mobility. c. Winter Storm Hazards and Safety Considerations.Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas causing sudden illness and(1)death, if inhaled. During power outages, the use of wood and fossil fuels forheating can cause carbon monoxide to build up in a home, garage, or camper.(a)  One of the most dangerous wintertime sources of carbon monoxide is car exhaust fumes. If keeping the engine on to operate the heater, ensure the vehicle is in a well ventilated area.(b)  Signs of carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, mental confusion, and extreme tiredness. Move victims into fresh air and provide immediate medical attention. Snow or ice accumulation on utility poles, power lines, and trees can cause (2)live electrical lines to fall. Once lines are down, wet snow can transfer electricity, creating a large danger area. Always assume power lines are live. Winter storms can lead to the collapse of buildings, trees, and utility poles. (3)Moving debris can cause cuts, scrapes, bruises, and sprains, especially to the hands, back, knees, and shoulders. Winter storms can damage walkways, parking lots, roads, and buildings. (4)Collapsing roofs are some of the biggest dangers. Leave at once if shifting or noise signals an imminent collapse. d. Winter storms may require military support with specific skills and equipment,including: (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)Transporting stranded civilians or essential personnel using military vehicles. Assessing damage to roads, bridges, structures, and utilities. Supporting SAR operations. Overlaying maps to depict damage, key facilities, or SAR activities.

A CBRN incident is any occurrence resulting from the use of a chemical,biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon. Additionally, it encompasses the emergence of secondary hazards arising from counterforce targeting or the release of toxic industrial material into the environment. CBRN threats and hazards include CBRN materials causing an adverse effect on the environment involving the emergence of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. b. CBRN incidents may require military capabilities to augment civilian resources,including: Providing specialized forces capable of conducting CBRN consequence Supporting mass casualty decontamination operations with properly trained (1)management.

Special Eventsa. National special security events (NSSE) represent the highest levels of eventsrequiring short-duration military support. NSSE’s include presidential inaugurations, major sporting events, presidential debates, State of the Union Addresses, national political conventions, and international gatherings (e.g., G-8 summit). Non-NSSE events or events of lesser significance are rated by the Special Events Working Group with a special events assessment rating. These events may still require DOD support similar to NSSEs. Regardless of the event, the RFA process is used to request DOD assets and capacities to support a primary agency. b. Special event missions require military-specific capabilities, including:(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)  (11)  (12)  (13)  (14)  (15)  Security forces.Ground forces.Airlift support and air defense.Maritime forces.Response and consequence management forces.Route survey.Logistics.Transportation.Very important person movement.Emergency evacuation.Staging areas and bases.Assistance with temporary staging and storage areas.Mass field feeding.Power supply.Communications.72 ATP 3-28.1/MCWP 3-36.2/NTTP 3-57.2/AFTTP 3-2.67  (cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:40)(cid:51) 2015 (16)  (17)  (18)  (19)  IAA support.

A cyberspace-related incident of national significance may take many forms,including an organized cyber-attack, an uncontrolled exploit (e.g., virus or worm), a natural disaster, or other incidents capable of causing extensive damage to critical infrastructure or key assets. b. Large-scale cyber incidents may overwhelm government and private-sectorresources by disrupting the internet and taxing critical infrastructure information systems. Complications from disruptions of this magnitude may threaten lives, property, the economy, and national security. Rapid identification, information exchange, investigation, and coordinated response will mitigate the damage. c. During DSCA operations, state and local networks operating in a disrupted ordegraded environment may require DOD assistance. Services support the remediation, restoration, and protection of critical emergency telecommunication networks and infrastructure. Cyberspace technical assistance may be provided in response to a request from a lead federal agency.  d.
