Principles  for  Filling  Positions.  The  Affirmative  Employment  Program  (AEP)  should include analysis, over time, of the centrally managed positions within the career field to identify and eliminate barriers that hamper the advancement of any individual on the basis of race, sex, national  origin,  and  disability.    Positions  may  be  filled  from  any  of  the  following  sources consistent with the priorities established herein and subject to the requirements of other pertinent programs of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), DoD, and AF or special employment programs.  (T-0)  Positions  must  be  filled  in  accordance  with  Federal  Equal  Employment Opportunity  law  and  AFPD  36-27,  Equal  Opportunity,  AFI  36-2706,  Equal  Opportunity Program  Military  and  Civilian,  Merit  System  Principles  (5  USC  2301),  and  AFI  36-205, Affirmative  Employment  Program  (AEP),  Special  Emphasis  Programs  (SEPs)  and  Reasonable Accommodation  (which  includes  requirements  of  the  Federal  Equal  Opportunity  Recruitment Program (FEORP)).  Covered positions include the following: (T-0) 1.1.1.  In-service placement of current permanent AF employees. 1.1.2.  Transfer or appointment of employees from other DoD and non-DoD federal agencies. 1.1.3.  Reinstatement or reemployment of eligible former federal employees. 1.1.4.  Other appointments, including those from OPM Delegated Examining Office (DEO). 1.2.  Equal  Opportunity  (EO)  .    In  order  to  ensure  that  EO  principles  are  followed  in  filling positions, EO Directors and Affirmative Employment Program Managers shall be included in the strategic/resource  planning  processes  at  the  base  level.    This  includes  but  is  not  limited  to  the forecasting  of  human  resources  needs  and  involvement  with  the  development  of  relevant documents to  support the forecasting process  (e.g., statistics, data,  etc.).   This  recommendation complies  with  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission’s  Management  Directive  715. (T-0) 1.2.1.  All supervisors shall receive training on Equal Opportunity (EO) policy, Merit System Principles (5 USC 2301), and Prohibited Personnel Practices (5 USC 2302). (T-0) 1.3.  Availability.  The  availability  of  eligible  AF  employees  who  could  be  considered  through merit  promotion  or  other  in-service  placement  procedures  does  not  prevent  a  decision  to restructure a vacant position and fill it at a different grade level nor does the availability of merit promotion  or  other  in-service  candidates  prevent  a  search  outside  AF  for,  and  appointment  of, qualified and available persons. (T-1) 1.4.  Suitability  of  Candidates  and  Security  Factors.  Before  finalizing  a  selection,  the CPS/OL may make sufficient written and/or oral inquiries of former employers, fellow workers, and other knowledgeable sources to  evaluate the candidate's qualifications and suitability.  The CPS/OL  also  initiates  required  security  checks  on  the  selected  candidate  in  accordance  with governing security regulations.  (T-0) The CPS/OL ensures required investigations are requested prior  to  entrance  on  duty  to  the  maximum  extent  practicable.  (T-1)  The  selecting  supervisor appraises the candidate's general suitability before making a final selection. 8 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 1.5.  Qualification Requirements. 1.5.1.  Normally, OPM establishes or approves qualification requirements for positions in the competitive  service.    (T-0)  Qualification  standards  prescribe  the  minimum  experience, training,  education,  and  physical  requirements,  or  otherwise  specify  required  knowledge, skills,  and  abilities  (KSAs)  necessary  for  successful  performance  in  the  position.    Local determination  of  physical  ability  or  accommodation  is  used  for  all  positions  that  do  not require  a  medical  examination,  i.e.,  positions  not  covered  by  specific  medical  standards, physical  requirements,  or  a  medical  evaluation  program.    Qualification  standards  are uniformly  applied  for  like  positions  and  maintained  as  a  record  for  OPM,  DoD  and  AF evaluation and quality assessment. (T-0) 1.5.2.  The  CPS  establishes  qualification  requirements  for  AF  positions  in  the  excepted service,  subject  to  any  applicable  restrictions  and  conditions,  as  prescribed  in  OPM directives,  AF  supplements,  and  by  DoD  and  AF  Career  Field  Teams  (CFTs).    The  OPM competitive  service  requirements  for  similar  type  positions  are  used  as  a  guide  for establishing standards for excepted service positions. 1.5.2.1.  Schedule  A  hiring  authority  (5  CFR  §  213.3102(u))  allows  for  the  non-competitive  appointment  of  qualified  individuals  with  severe  physical  disabilities, psychiatric  disabilities  and  intellectual  disabilities,  without  posting  and  publicizing  the position,  without  clearance  of  priority  placement  and  without  going  through  the certificate process.  (T-0) 1.5.2.1.1.  Management  may  noncompetitively  convert  to  a  permanent  status  in  the competitive  service  an  employee  who  has  completed  2  years  of  satisfactory  service under  this  Schedule  A  authority.    Satisfactory  service  begins  with  a  non-temporary appointment. (T-0) 1.5.2.2.  Thirty  percent  or  more  compensable  Disabled  Veterans  may  be  appointed  to  a Provisional  (temporary)  Appointment  of  at  least  60  days  without  an  announcement  or competition.  (T-0) 1.5.2.2.1.  Management  may  convert  the  employee  without  a  break  in  service  to  a career  or  career-conditional  appointment  after  at  least  60  days  in  the  temporary appointment. 1.5.3.  When an employee is affected by reduction-in-force (RIF), a waiver of qualifications or appropriate accommodation should be considered in accordance with prevailing rules and regulations  and  should  be  agreed  to  by  all  parties  (CPS  and  gaining  supervisor)  before assignment to a vacancy. (T-0) 1.5.4.  When  an  employee  has  a  disability  or  becomes  disabled  while  employed,  the  Air Force shall, when requested, provide a reasonable accommodation that permits the employee to  perform  the  essential  functions  of  the  position,  unless  doing  so  will  impose  an  undue hardship  on  the  Air  Force.    The  nature  of  the  accommodation  is  determined  through  an interactive  process  among  the  parties  (CPS  and  gaining  supervisor).  The  reasonable accommodation rules are set out in AFI 36-205. (T-0) 1.5.4.1.  Reassignment will be considered if no appropriate reasonable accommodation is available  to  enable  the  qualified  individual  with  a  disability  to  perform  the  essential AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 9 functions of  his or her current job/position or if the only effective accommodation would cause  undue  hardship  on  the  Air  Force.    Positions  appropriate  for  consideration  for reassignment  of  qualified  individuals  with  a  disability  will  include:    (a)  all  vacant positions  at  the  same  grade,  or  at  a  lower  grade,  within  the  commuting  area  or  any geographic area to which the employee indicates he or she is willing to move (at his/her own expense) and for which the employee is qualified; and (b) any planned jobs/positions which appropriate officials can reasonably assume will become available over a period of 60  business  days,  for  which  the  individual  with  disability  is  qualified,  at  same  pay,  or lower rate of pay. (T-1) 1.6.  Referral and Selection Priorities.  Table 2.3., Referral and Selection Priorities establishes the order of priorities that are observed when filling competitive service vacancies at continuing activities.  These priorities apply to excepted service position vacancies to the extent applicable. (T-0) For this purpose, a vacancy does not exist when an occupied position is: 1.6.1.  Reclassified  because  of  a  change  in  classification  standards  or  to  correct  a classification error, provided the incumbent is retained in the position. 1.6.2.  Cancelled  and  a  successor  position  is  immediately  established  that  is  filled  by  the incumbent through an authorized personnel action. 1.7.  Referral and Selection of Candidates. 1.7.1.  Because  of  the  requirement  to  observe  priorities  established  by  law,  regulation  and other  higher  authority  outlined  in  this  manual,  the  office  issuing  the  referral  certificate determines the eligibility of candidates for consideration and identifies those to be referred. (T-0) 1.7.2.  When  contacting  applicants  for  consideration,  recruiting  officials  and  selecting supervisors  should  provide  complete  information  regarding  duties,  working  conditions, availability  of  local  community  services,  and  all  other  matters  needed  for  the  prospective employee(s) to make a decision. 1.7.2.1.  Position  descriptions  are  presented  accurately  and  without  misrepresentation. Positions  may  not  be  described  in  such  a  way  as  to  discourage  interest  or  solicit declinations.  Unless absolutely required for the position, position descriptions, vacancy announcements  and  job  assessments  will  not  mandate  specific  military  or  MAJCOM attributes that can only be gained through uniformed service, but instead will emphasize the  capabilities  needed  for  the  position.    These  documents  should  be  reviewed  prior  to starting the recruitment process for a new fill or during development for a new position. (T-1) 1.7.2.2.  Selecting officials and supervisors may not make a tentative job offer or implied commitment to any candidate without obtaining clearance from AFPC, except when the positon  is  a  “critical”  need  position  (i.e.,  EHA/DHA).    Selecting  officials  may  extend tentative  job  offers  for  “critical”  need  positions,  conditional  on  final  verification  from AFPC of eligibility, priority clearance, and all necessary hiring requirements are met. (T-1) 1.7.3.  The authority for personnel management is usually delegated to the lowest practicable level  of  supervision.    However,  when  training,  employment,  or  promotion  patterns  in  an 10 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 organization indicate the principle of equal employment opportunity may not have been fully observed, the commander may withdraw selection authority and assign it to the next higher level supervisor(s) pending the outcome of an inquiry. (T-1) 1.7.4.  Selecting officials are to evaluate employees’ records on merit:  experience, education, functional  and institutional  competencies,  and performance.  Prior  geographic mobility will not  be  a  selection  factor  for  hiring  and  promotions.    This  policy  does  not  prohibit  the requirement to sign a mobility agreement as a condition of selection for future employment, where necessary for specific positions (e.g., KCPs). (T-1) 1.7.5.  Minimum Announcement Period.  All civilian job announcements will be posted for a minimum of 5 business days on www.usajobs.gov.  Exceptions may be granted based upon previous recruitment actions that show an overwhelming applicant response.  In addition, for all  GS-13/14/15  and  equivalents,  the  recommended  announcement  period  is  10  business days. (T-1) internal 1.7.6.  No  External-Only  Recruitment.  Managers  will recruitment  and  placement  actions  for  all  civilian  positions.  Management  may  initiate internal  and  external  recruitment  simultaneously  or  choose  to  consider  external  candidates after  internal  recruitment  and  consideration  has  been  conducted.  This  does  not  apply  to positions  covered  by  the  special  expedited  hiring  authority  granted  to  the  acquisition community by statute. (T-1) initiate  and  consider 1.8.  Prompt  Release  of  Employees.  An  employee  is  not  restricted  from  accepting  a  position offer from another AF activity or federal agency, or from accepting another position within an activity  for  which  the  employee  is  properly  referred  and  selected.    The  supervisor  releases  an employee promptly to another position on the same installation, usually within 20 calendar days after  receiving  notice  of  the  employee's  selection.    An  extension  of  up  to  10  days  may  be requested  to  train  a  replacement  if  the  delay  does  not  jeopardize  the  employee's  transfer  or movement to another position (see para 2.18.). 1.9.  Assisting  the  New  Employee.  The supervisor and CPS/OL have a joint responsibility for providing  information  and  assistance  to  the  new  employee.    An  employee  who  is  moved  to  a different geographical area should be given pertinent information about the new location, such as information on transportation, local community services, etc. 1.10.  Special  Employment  Programs.  Air  Force  activities  are  expected  to  develop  special employment  programs  designed  to  supplement  the  merit  promotion  and  in-service  placement programs.    These  programs  purposefully  seek  to  enhance  employment  opportunities  in  such areas as the employment of veterans, employment of persons with targeted disabilities, Pathways Student Intern Programs, and special programs for the disadvantaged.  Many of these programs offer only temporary employment and may be used to the extent funds, facilities, and capability to  provide  supervision  and  training  are  available.    Judgment  is  used  to  provide  equitable  and balanced consideration of candidates from all sources, depending on the circumstances that exist at the activity and in the employment area.  (T-2)  Centrally managed positions are governed by AFMAN 36-606, Civilian Career Field Management and Development. 1.11.  Spouses in Leave Without Pay (LWOP) Status.  A spouse accompanying a transferring military  or  civilian  sponsor,  and  who  is  either  in  LWOP  status,  has  competitive  status,  or  is otherwise eligible for immediate appointment is entitled to compete for available positions in the AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 11 new  geographic  area.    Consideration  is  given  up  to  and  including  the  highest  grade  for  which qualified and eligible (reference PPP Handbook for EO 13473 eligibility).    (T-0)   The gaining installation  will  continue  to  counsel  and  to  afford  appropriate  consideration  for  positions  for which qualified. (T-2) 1.12.  Employees  on  Retained  Grade.  Table  2.3.,  provides  for  the  priority  referral  of employees  affected  by  RIF,  transfer  of  function  (TOF),  or  reclassification  of  position,  who  are placed on retained grade. (T-0) 1.13.  Filling  Positions  at  the  GS-14/GS-15  and  equivalent  levels.  Except  for  positions covered  by  the  CFT  that  have  received  specific  authority  to  use  an  alternate  method  of identifying  candidates,  all  GS-14/GS-15  and  equivalent  level  position  vacancies  in  the competitive service, including those overseas, require competition and the use of a hiring panel (see  below),  unless  the  position  is  filled  through  lateral  reassignment  or  covered  by  one  of  the exceptions below in this section. (T-1)  1.13.1.  The  vacancy  announcement  will  contain  sufficient  information  to  provide  the potential applicant  with  the following:  adequate  knowledge of the position, responsibilities, important  KSAs,  training  requirements,  application  instructions,  Joint  Travel  Regulation (JTR) information, and other pertinent job information (T-0) 1.13.2.  The servicing activity for the position first screens the qualifications of the applicants against  the  qualification  standard  and  other  basic  eligibility  criteria.    Candidates  may  be tentatively  ranked  or  grouped job analysis/promotion plan. in  broad  qualification  categories  against the 1.13.3.  A  hiring  panel  must  be  used  and  consist  of  at  least  three  individuals,  equal  to  or senior in grade to the advertised position.  The panel composition should be diverse under the AF  definition  of  diversity  in  AFI  36-7001,  Diversity,  and  will  include  at  least  one  career civilian  with  no  prior  military  service.    If  there  are  no  career  civilians  in  the  unit,  then  a career civilian from outside the unit may be utilized.  The use of hiring panels will increase transparency  to  the  selection  process  and  provide  hiring  officials  various  perspectives  and insights on the candidates. (T-1) 1.13.4.  The  panel  will  screen  the  records  of  all  candidates,  interview  the  most  qualified  as appropriate,  and  make  recommendations  to  the  selecting  official.    (T-1)  The  criteria  must have breadth of scope to permit evaluation of the overall qualifications of each candidate in relation  to  the total  requirements  of the position.  The panel's evaluation  is  used to  identify the  top-ranking  candidates  who,  in  the  panel's  judgment,  are  highly  qualified,  considering such  factors  as  education,  training  and  experience;  appraisals/evaluations  and  job-related awards,  honors,  and  relevant  outside  activities.    The  panel  will  also  consider  those repromotion  eligible  candidates  previously  referred  who  have  further  consideration entitlement  and  evaluate  their  qualifications  against  the  ranking  criteria  in  the  promotion plan.    When  necessary,  temporary  duty  travel  (TDY)  may  be  authorized  to  attend  an interview for AF and other federal employees as provided in the JTR. (T-0) The use of hiring panels is not required for the placement of career broadeners or of individuals returning from a boarded civilian developmental education program. 1.13.5.  Commanders  of  MAJCOMs  and  comparable  organizations  and  other  staff  offices may  make  the  selection  personally,  request  higher  authority  to  make  the  selection,  or 12 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 authorize  supervisors  at  any  level  over  the  position  to  make  the  selection  (after  the  panel convenes).        (T-1)  In  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  the  AF,  selections  may  be  made  by officials  designated  by  the  Secretary.    (T-1)    In  HQ  USAF,  selections  may  be  made  by directors  or  heads  of  comparable  or  higher  organizations,  or  they  may  request  higher authority  to  make  the  selection.    (T-1)  AFDW/A1C  issues  procedures  for  the  Office  of  the Secretary and HQ USAF. 1.13.6.  The  specified  requirements  for  publication  of  the  vacancy,  consideration  of candidates, and panel evaluation of candidates do not apply, or are modified when: (T-1) 1.13.6.1.  Filling  a  temporary  position  for  one  year  or  less  by  an  authorized noncompetitive personnel action.

The DVAAP report includes  accomplishments,  successes,  and  practices  in  efforts  to  recruit,  hire,  and  train disabled veterans as well as certain veterans of the Vietnam era and of the post-Vietnam era who are qualified for such employment and advancement. 1.14.5.2.  Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program (FEORP).  The FEORP report highlights specific accomplishments  and efforts  to  recruit, develop, and retain a diverse workforce.    The  FEORP  report  should  address  practices  and  activities  implemented  to improve  the  recruitment,  career  development,  and  retention  of  Hispanics  (Executive Order 13171 of October 12, 2000). 14 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 1.14.5.3.  Management  Directive  715  (MD-715)  Report.  The  Directive  provided  by  the Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission  (EEOC)  provides  policy  guidance  and standards for establishing and maintaining effective affirmative employment programs of equal  employment  opportunity  under  Section  717  of  Title  VII  (Part  A)  and  effective affirmative action programs under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act (Part B). 1.14.5.3.1.  The requirements of MD-715 are set out in AFI 36-205. (T-0) 1.15.  The DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP). 1.15.1.  The PPP is an automated mandatory placement program used to match eligible well-qualified registrants, most of whom are subject to displacement, with vacant DoD positions.  It  enables  the  DoD  to  maintain  a  relatively  stable  work  force  during  base  realignment  and closure (BRAC), RIF, and other displacement actions, and minimizes the adverse effects of these actions on employees. 1.15.2.  The PPP consists of several subprograms with the primary purpose of placing DoD employees who have been adversely affected through no fault of their own. 1.15.3.  The  DoD  PPP  Automated  Stopper  and  Referral  System  (ASARS)  is  a  centralized automated  system  used  to  match  eligible,  well-qualified  registrants,  with  vacant  DoD positions and can be used as a recruitment source when the automatic stopper is cleared. 1.15.4.  Commanders or heads of activities organizationally responsible for the CPS function at  each  installation  will  issue  to  all  subordinate  supervisors,  managers,  and  staff  officials upon arrival and not later than every 3 years thereafter, a written statement of support for the DoD PPP and ensure all recipients comply with  the spirit, letter and intent of this program.  Human  Resource  Officers  may  obtain  additional  statements  of  support  from  the  heads  of other serviced organizations.  Commander Support Statements are required to be maintained by the AFPC/PPP Oversight Office. (T-0) 1.15.5.  Refer http://www.cpms.osd.mil. to the  PPP  Handbook for  specific information  and  guidance  at AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 15 Chapter 2 THE AIR FORCE MERIT PROMOTION PLAN (MPP) 2.1.  Policy Objectives  .  Air Force promotion policy is based on strict conformance with merit system  principles  specified  in  5  U.S.C.  2301,  Merit  System  Principles  and  5  CFR  Part  335, Promotion and Internal Placement.  The merit promotion and placement plan provides a uniform and  equitable  means  of  referral  and  selection  for  all  placement  actions  according  to  merit principles  under  merit  promotion  procedures.    A  sound  program,  administered  and  fully supported by managers and employees at all levels, is essential to the staffing of an effective and highly  motivated  civilian  work  force.    Identifying,  qualifying,  evaluating  and  selecting candidates  is  made  without  regard  to  lawful  political  affiliation  race,  color,  religion,  sex (including  pregnancy,  sexual  orientation,  and  gender  identity),  national  origin,  age,  disability, genetic  information,  marital  status,  prior  EO  activity,  or  any  other  non-merit  factors  prohibited by statute, regulation, or Executive Order.  (T-0) Failure to adhere to equal opportunity or merit principles  may  compel  a  commander  or  designee  to  withdraw  selecting  authority  from  a supervisor and elevate the selection process to the next level of supervision.   (T-1) The plan is directed toward: (T-1) 2.1.1.  Accomplishing mission goals by staffing positions with high quality employees. 2.1.2.  Providing  career  opportunities  for  employees  and  making  sure  all  employees  have access to information about these opportunities. 2.1.3.  Ensuring  management  is  aware  of  high  quality  employees  who  have  the  capacity  to perform in more responsible assignments. 2.1.4.  Encouraging employees to broaden their experience and enhance their qualifications. 2.1.5.  Ensuring employees are placed in positions for which they are qualified. 2.1.6.  Ensuring  the  skills,  qualifications,  achievements,  and  promotion  potential  of employees are recognized and fairly considered in the staffing process. 2.1.7.  Encouraging employees to improve their performance and to develop their skills. 2.1.8.  Utilizing an automated staffing tool in support of AF MPP.  This process involves the use of one public announcement, a single staffing tool for evaluating candidate resumes for qualifications,  and  the  production  of  one  referral  list  with  selecting  officials  receiving resumes for all referred candidates.  Key to the program is the OPM website for USAJOBS:  www.usajobs.gov.  The goal is to meet the OPM recommended standard for fill time. (T-0) 2.2.  Key  Principles  .    The  following  principles  form  the  basis  of  the  AF  Merit  Promotion Program: 2.2.1.  All applicants within the designated area of consideration, who meet the qualification standards  and  any  legal  or  regulatory  requirements  imposed  by  the  Office  of  Personnel Management  (OPM),  or  other  authority,  may  be  considered  and  must  be  within  reach  for referral.  (T-0) 2.2.2.  The  minimum  Area  of  Consideration  (AOC)  will  include  the  AF,  DoD  and  transfer and  reinstatement  eligibles.    This  will  also  include  Individuals  with  Targeted  Disabilities 16 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 (eligible  for  selection  under  Schedule  A).    This  minimum  area  of  consideration  may  be broadened  as  necessary  to  provide  management  with  a  sufficient  number  of  high  quality candidates  from  which  to  choose  and  to  provide  employees  with  adequate  opportunities  to advance. This applies to all locally and centrally managed positions. 2.2.2.1.  Exceptions to the minimum AOC may include the following: (T-1) 2.2.2.1.1.  Positions subject to the Developmental Team process. 2.2.2.1.2.  Career broadener/intern outplacements. 2.2.2.1.3.  Placements to minimize adverse action (displaced employees). 2.2.3.  Appropriate  job-related  criteria  are  applied  with  fairness  in  evaluating  candidates  to differentiate among their qualifications and to identify those qualified for consideration.  (T-0) 2.2.4.  Selections  are  made  without  discrimination  for  any  non-merit  reason  and  without favoritism based on personal relationships or patronage. (T-0) 2.2.5.  Consideration  is  given  to  input  from  employees,  employee  groups,  and  recognized labor  organizations  in  developing  and  establishing  merit  promotion  procedures,  consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements.  (T-2) Promotions and placements into positions with  known  promotion  potential  are  usually  competitive.    Promotions  without  competition IAW  Table  2.1  are  authorized  with  due  consideration  to  recognized  merit  principles.  Employees  are  kept  informed  about  the  promotion  plan,  the  provisions  and  procedures  for promotion plans affecting them, and eligibility requirements.  They  are  given full access  to information about advancement opportunities and how to take advantage of them. (T-0) 2.3.  The  Right  to  Select  or  Non-Select  from  a  Group  of  Qualified  Candidates.  Provided there  are  no  higher  mandatory  placement  priorities  available,  managers  have  the  right  and  the responsibility  to  select  from  other  appropriate  sources,  determining  which  candidates  are  most likely to meet mission objectives, and contribute new ideas and viewpoints. (T-1) These sources include, but are not limited to promotion eligible candidates. 2.4.  General Coverage. 2.4.1.  The  MPP  applies  to  the  following  categories  of  employees,  who  must  apply  to  be considered for a job listed under a vacancy announcement: (T-1) 2.4.1.1.  Any appropriated fund employee occupying a permanent or indefinite position in the competitive service; 2.4.1.1.1.  EXCEPTION:  When a candidate is available, who is otherwise qualified, currently holds or has previously held a grade on a permanent basis in the competitive service which is no greater than the potential of a position being filled, the candidate may be considered for the position without competition. 2.4.1.2.  Any  employee  on  an  Overseas  Limited  Appointment  (OLA)  of  indefinite duration or not to exceed five years duration because of the DoD mandatory requirement to rotate from the overseas area; 2.4.1.3.  Any employee serving under an excepted service appointment with competitive status; AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 17 2.4.1.4.  Any  employee  currently  serving  under  a  Veterans’  Recruitment  Appointment (VRA); 2.4.1.5.  Any  employee  who  is  a  family  member  and  is  serving  under  a  Schedule  A 213.3106(b)(6)  appointment  whose  position  is  temporarily  converted  to  the  excepted service; 2.4.1.6.  Any  employee  under  a  competitive  or  excepted  service  appointment  absent  in military  service;  or,  serving  with  an  international  organization;  or,  in  leave  without  pay (LWOP) status while in receipt of injury compensation. 2.4.2.  This  plan  applies  to  all  status  applicants  applying  from  external  sources,  including:  DoD and non-DoD transfer eligibles; reinstatement eligibles; those eligible for appointment under  any  non-competitive  appointing  authority  and  candidates  eligible  under  the  Veterans Employment  Opportunities Act  (VEOA) of 1998.   NOTE:    When filling positions through competitive  examining,  the  requirement  to  allow  VEOA  candidates  to  apply  when applications are received from  outside an  agency's own workforce  does not  apply since the competitive examining process is open to the public and anyone can apply. 2.4.2.1.  When  candidates  are  considered  from  outside  the  AF  for  competitive  service vacancies lasting more than 120 days, the AFPC and OL’s must post these vacancies on USAJOBS as required by 5 CFR 330.102 (b) and 5 CFR 330.707(a).  (T-0) 2.4.2.1.1.  DoDI  1327.06,  Leave  and  Liberty  Policy  and  Procedures,  provides  that service members may be in  a terminal  leave status prior to  retirement, separation or release from active duty.  The Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) to Hire Heroes Act (codified at 5 USC § 2108a) requires federal agencies to treat service members as veterans,  disabled  veterans,  and  preference  eligibles  when  they  submit,  at  the  time they apply for a Federal job, a certification stating they are expected to be honorably discharged or released from active duty within 120 days after the date of submission of the certificate. 2.4.2.1.1.1.  Within  120  days  from  the  date  of  submission  of  the  certification, service members must retire or separate from military service in order to comply with the VOW and associated laws.  If a military member starts terminal leave but is  not  retired  or  separated  within  120  days  from  the  date  of  submission  of  the certification,  they  are  not  eligible  under  VOW.    The  first  day  of  terminal  leave status is not to be confused with the separation date.  The service member’s last day of leave coincides with the last day of active duty. (T-0) 2.4.3.  The MPP applies to internal placement for all positions in the competitive service, all career  field  centrally  managed  positions,  including  and  specifically  designated  positions  in the excepted service, with the following exclusions: 2.4.3.1.  All  positions  above  GS-15,  Scientific  and  Professional  (ST)  positions,  Senior Executive Service (SES) positions, and other equivalent positions at the senior level. 2.4.3.2.  Positions covered by OPM-approved personnel demonstration projects. 2.4.4.  Applicants will be excluded from consideration when: (T-3) 2.4.4.1.  They have not applied by the closing date of the vacancy announcement. 18 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 2.4.4.2.  They have not completed 90 days of Federal service after appointment from an OPM  or  DEO  competitive  certificate  (applies  to  consideration  for:  reassignment  or change to lower grade to a different line of work, reassignment or change to lower grade to a different geographical area, or promotion). 2.4.4.3.  They  are on  LWOP  and are not  expected to  return to  duty or are on sick leave pending disability retirement. 2.4.4.4.  They occupy a formal developmental position with a target  grade equivalent to or higher than the target grade of the position being filled.  (See paragraph 2.5.) 2.4.4.5.  They have a current unacceptable appraisal. 2.4.4.6.  The  position  requires  access  to  sensitive  information  and  they  have  an  open security  incident,  an  open  Security  Information  File,  their  security  clearance  has  been revoked or denied, or they are in an action pending status in the security clearance system of record. 2.4.4.7.  They do not meet time-in-grade requirements when such requirements apply. 2.4.5.  This  guidance  applies  to  career  field  centrally  managed  positions  established  by  HQ USAF  for  specific  occupation  groupings  and  grade  levels  developed  in  consonance  with governing merit promotion principles. 2.4.6.  Candidates Referred on an OPM or DEO Certificate. A current AF employee referred on  either  of  these  certificates,  who  is  referred  concurrently  from  an  in-service  referral certificate, may be selected from the certificate that offers the candidate the best opportunity. 2.4.7.  Details.  A detail to a position that is identical to the employee’s current position or is of the same grade, series, and basic duties as the employee’s current position does not require documentation. 2.4.7.1.  Details  of  more  than  30  but  less  than  120  days  to  a  different  higher  graded position  or  with  promotion  potential  must  be  documented  with  an  SF  52  showing  the organization and position to which detailed, the effective date of the detail and its not to exceed  date.    Details  may  be  made  non-competitively;  however,  successive  details  to  a higher grade beyond 120 days must be made using competitive procedures (Table 2.1.).  (T-0) Refer to The Guide To Processing Personnel Actions, Chapter 14. 2.4.7.2.  Details of more than 30 days but less than 120 days to a different position at the same  or  lower  grade  which  do  not  have  promotion  potential  do  not  require documentation. 2.4.7.3.  Employees  are  responsible  for  updating  their  resumes  to  document  any  Detail not covered by an official personnel action. 2.4.7.4.  The  AF  CFTs  do  not  approve  requests  to    process  competitive  Details  for Centrally  Managed  Positions  except  for  when  the  Detail  is  part  of  a  formal developmental program.  Refer to AFMAN 36-606. 2.4.7.5.  Time spent on temporary promotion or detail to higher graded position(s) during preceding 12 month period is counted toward the 120 day-limitation. AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 19 2.5.  Formal  Trainee  and  Apprentice-Type  Positions.  An  employee  in  a  formal  trainee  or apprentice-type  training  program,  to  include,  Developmental  Opportunity  Program,  PALACE Acquire or Copper CAP  interns, must be informed in  writing at  the time of their enrollment  in their training program they are not eligible to be considered for other positions at a grade up to and including the target grade of their current training position. (T-2)  The primary reason is they could already be in the same line of work of the targeted grade, which equals the target grade of their  current  position.    The  associated  training  program  must  be  successfully  completed.  (T-2) However,  when  the  grade  of  the  position  being  filled  exceeds  the  grade  of  the  current  training position of the employee, if otherwise qualified, the employee may be considered for the higher graded position. 2.6.  Applicability to Positions Outside the Competitive Service. 2.6.1.  When all or a majority of the positions at  an activity are in the excepted service and are  under  the  same  appointment  authority,  a  MPP  must  be  created  to  provide  a  systematic and  equitable  method  of  identifying  employees  for  consideration.    The  policies  and procedures of this manual should be followed to the extent practicable. (T-1) 2.6.2.  An  AF  employee,  in  the  excepted  service,  who  has  competitive  status  by  virtue  of having held a previous competitive appointment is eligible to be considered for a competitive service position according to this program.  Likewise, an AF employee who is serving on an excepted appointment which conveys competitive status is also eligible to be considered for a competitive service position.  These employees are afforded the same consideration provided to competitive service employees in terms of career progression and merit principles. 2.7.  Applying Competitive Promotion Procedures. 2.7.1.  Use of competition in filling certain positions is based on the requirements of 5 CFR Part 335 and AFPD 36-2, Civilian Recruitment and Placement. Determination of the use of competitive procedures will be made by AFPC in accordance with merit systems principles and in coordination with local management’s desire to consider specific resources.  (T-0) 2.7.2.  Table 2.1 lists personnel actions which are subject to competition and those which are not subject to competition.  Merit promotion processing procedures are outlined in Table 2.2.  The Civilian Personnel Officer (CPO) or designee is responsible for determining whether an action  will  be  subject  to  competition  and  the  extent  of  that  competition.    When  a  proposed action  is  not  specifically  covered  by  the  table,  basic  merit  principles  should  be  applied  in deciding  whether  to  require  competition.    Even  when  the  table  exempts  an  action  from  the requirement for competition, the CPO may choose to apply the competitive process when use of competitive procedures would be consistent with merit principles and would be in the best interest of management. (T-3) 2.8.  Actions Not Subject to Competition. 2.8.1.  When  a  position  is  excepted  from  the  competitive  process,  annotate  the  rule  and paragraph of the MPP that supports the exception in the Remarks section (i.e., Part D) of the SF  52,  Request  for  Personnel  Action  (RPA)  used  to  process  the  action.    Actions  involving centrally  managed  positions  must  be  approved  by  the  appropriate  CFT  functional  manager prior to effecting the action and the SF-52 (RPA) must be so annotated to reflect the approval of the respective CFT. (T-1) 20 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 2.8.2.  After all mandatory placement priorities are satisfied, an employee may be promoted up to and including a grade previously held on a permanent basis in the competitive service or  other  merit  system  from  which  separated  or  changed  to  lower  grade  for  other  than performance or conduct reasons. 2.8.3.  An  employee  initially  selected  under  competitive  procedures  for  a  position  with known  promotion  potential,  may  be  non-competitively  promoted  to  an  intervening  targeted grade at management’s request.  However, the employee must meet eligibility requirements for promotion to the intervening grades, as well as any additional qualifying criteria, such as satisfactory  completion  of  all  training  required  at  the  current  grade  level  (OJT  or  formal).  (T-0) 2.8.4.  A position change at the same grade from a position with known promotion potential to  a  position  with  no  known  higher  potential  may  be  accomplished  without  further competition. 2.8.5.  Upon  exercise  of  restoration  rights  following  military  duty  or  service  with  an international  organization,  a  former  employee  may  be  placed  in  any  position  for  which qualified  which  is  no  higher  in  grade  than  the  position  to  which  they  were  promoted  in absentia or because their former position was re-graded during their absence. 2.8.6.  An employee must be non-competitively promoted following reclassification of their position  to  a  higher  grade  due  to  application  of  new  classification  standards  or  following correction of classification error, provided they meet all qualification and legal requirements for  advancement  to  the  position.  (See  Tables  2.1  and  2.4  for  appropriate  action  to  place incumbent.)  (T-0) 2.8.7.  If  a  position  is  upgraded  due  to  the  accretion/assignment  of  additional  higher  grade duties and responsibilities, the incumbent may be non-competitively promoted provided there is clear evidence the employee continues to perform the same basic functions as in the former position, there are no other employees serving in similar or identical positions to whom the duties  could  be  assigned,  and  they  meet  all  qualification  and  legal  requirements  for advancement to the higher grade of the position. In this case, there must be clear evidence the newly  classified  position  is  a  clear  successor  to  the  former  position  and  the  higher-graded position  has  absorbed  the  major  duties  of  the  former  position.    (T-0)  Included  in  this provision  are  employees  returning  from  overseas,  exercising  return  rights  to  obligated positions  which  have  been  upgraded  during  their  absence.    (See  Tables  2.1  and  2.4  for appropriate action to place incumbent.) 2.8.8.  Employees  on  grade  retention  will  be  referred  for  positions  at  grades  up  to  and including their retained grade within the same pay system from which demoted according to the  priorities  and  policies  specified  in  Table  2.3  and  in  accordance  with  procedures  in  the DoD PPP Handbook, Chapter 15, DoD Retained Grade Placement Program (Program R). (T-0) 2.8.9.  Interns and Recent Graduates under the Pathways Program may be non-competitively converted to a competitive service appointment upon successful completion of all experience and  education  requirements.    For  more  information,  refer  to  Department  of  the  Air  Force Pathways Program Guide. AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 21 2.9.  Repromotion  of  Previously  Downgraded  Employees  on  Pay  Retention.  Employees entitled  to  pay  retention,  except  those  in  formal  development  programs,  developmental opportunity  positions,  or  those  who  accepted  change  to  lower  grade  with  pay  retention  in response to  solicitation for a hard-to-fill  position, may be re-promoted non-competitively up to and  including  the  grade  in  the  same  pay  system  from  which  downgraded.    Repromotion  may occur  as  a  planned  management  action  or  when  determined  to  be  within  reach  on  a  referral certificate. 2.10.  Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Travel Allowances. 2.10.1.  Centrally  Managed  Positions.    Travel  and  relocation  expenses  (PCS  costs)  may  be paid when filling a centrally managed position IAW AFMAN 36-606.  However, only certain centrally-funded positions are eligible to use the DoD National Relocation Program (DNRP) to sell their home. For more information on the category of centrally-funded positions, refer to AFMAN 36-606. 2.10.2.  Job  Announcements.    The  appropriate  official  (funds  approving  official)  should determine, prior to advertising the vacancy, whether or not it is in the Government’s interest to pay PCS allowances.  Therefore, the job announcement must include one of the following: 2.10.2.1.  “TRAVEL  AND  RELOCATION  EXPENSES  WILL  BE  PAID  IAW  JTR AND AFMAN 36-606.” (T-0) 2.10.2.2.  “TRAVEL AND RELOCATION EXPENSES WILL NOT BE PAID”. Refer to AFMAN  36-606  for  guidance  regarding  centrally  managed  positions  to  determine  PCS allowances. (T-1) 2.10.3.  Factors  in  determining  PCS  allowances  as  being  in  the  government’s  interest  are generally  based  on  recruitment  sources  that  would  cause  movement  of  a  Federal  employee from  one  Permanent  Duty  Station  (PDS)  to  another  or  when  “first  duty  station”  moves  are authorized.  Other factors such as cost effectiveness, labor market conditions and difficulty in filling  the  vacancy  must  be  considered.    (T-0)  The  JTR,  5502-B2c(2)  is  clear  that  budget constraints  do  not  justify  denial  of  PCS  allowances  when  other  factors  indicate  the allowances  would  be  in  the  Government’s  interest.   When  an  employee  pursues,  solicits  or requests  (not  in  response  to  a  vacancy  announcement)  a  position  change  resulting  in  a geographic  move  from  one  Permanent  Duty  Station  (PDS)  to  another,  the  transfer  is considered  to  be  for  the  employee’s  convenience  and  benefit  and  not  in  the  Government’s interest. 2.10.3.1.  When  management  decides  to  NOT  pay  PCS  allowances,  the  reason(s)  and name of the selecting official must be documented in Part D of the RPA and clearly show the  paid  move  is  not  in  the  government’s  interest.    (T-0)  The  selecting  official  must notify all applicants selected for an interview of the decision to pay or not to pay for PCS in the official selection/non-selection notification as required by JTR 5502-B2c(3). (T-0) 2.10.3.2.  When  management  decides  to  pay  PCS  allowances  and  the  statement  “Travel and Relocation Expenses will be Paid IAW JTR and AFMAN 36-606” is included in the vacancy  announcement,  the  final  determination  regarding  payment/nonpayment  of  PCS allowances may be made after applicants have been referred to the selecting official.  (T-0) The final determination is usually based on the candidate(s) selected.  For example, if a candidate from the local commuting area of the vacancy is selected, there would be no 22 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 need to authorize PCS allowances; however, if someone outside the commuting area was selected, PCS allowances should be authorized. 2.11.  Identifying  Candidates  for  Referral.  The  evaluation  of  applicants  for  eligibility, qualifications and ranking will be accomplished through  an automated system to  identify those eligible for promotion, reassignment, and voluntary change to lower grade.   (T-0) 2.11.1.  Applicants may obtain job announcements from OPM’s USAJOBS website. This is the same website to which they may subscribe to receive automatic notification of vacancies. 2.11.2.  Applicants  must  apply  for  consideration  for  positions,  including  centrally  managed positions.  (T-0) Application must be made by the closing date of the announcement. (T-0) 2.11.3.  Applicants who apply are considered through a resume review process that identifies competing applicants.  Each competitive applicant will be rated and ranked and placed into one of three quality groups based on a rating assessment:  “Best Qualified - rating assessment score  of  90  or  above;  Fully  Qualified  -  rating  assessment  score  of  80-89;  and  Basically Qualified - rating assessment score of 70-79” as validated by the respective Job Analysis. 2.11.4.  The  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  (AFRC)  may  refer  ART  officers  for  ART vacancies whether or not they apply for ART vacancies. 2.12.  Priority  Referral.  The  order  of  special  placement  consideration  and  referral  in  filling vacant positions will be in accordance with Table 2.3. (T-0) 2.12.1.  Exception to the Requirement to Clear Local Priorities. Centrally Funded PALACE Acquire/COPPER  CAP  positions  are  not  considered  local  positions  for  the  purpose  of clearing local priorities.  Local priorities will be cleared at the time the intern completes their training  program  and  is  placed  on  a  locally  funded  permanent  position.  (T-0)  NOTE:  Centrally Funded Air Force Wounded Warrior (AFW2) positions are not local positions for the purpose of clearing local priorities.  Like intern positions, local priorities will be cleared at the time the AFW2 is placed onto a locally funded permanent position. (T-1) 2.13.  Job Analysis/Promotion Plan/Assessment.  A job analysis identifies specific job-related criteria, knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs), and other characteristics necessary to determine which candidates are eligible for referral to a position being filled.  A core personnel document (CPD) or position description is used as the basis for the job analysis. 2.13.1.  The job analysis is accomplished by the personnel staffing specialist and functional subject matter expert (SME) for the occupational series of the position being filled.  The job analysis  identifies  major  job  requirements  (MJRs)  and  essential  KSAs  required  to successfully performing the duties of the position. 2.13.2.  The promotion plan is developed based on the job analysis.  The analysis shows, at minimum,  the  position(s)  covered  by  the  plan;  the  minimum  qualification  requirements; appropriate  qualifying  factors;  selective  placement  factors  (if  used)  and  applicable  ranking factors.    Validated  job-related  evaluation  criteria  that  extend  beyond  the  minimum requirements  specified  by  the  qualification  standard  may  be  used  to  permit  meaningful ranking of eligible candidates.  Candidates are evaluated utilizing the ranking criteria.  The end result is a documented promotion plan. 2.13.3.  Career  field  development  teams  (DT)  or  equivalent,  composed  of  functional representatives assisted by AFPC civilian personnel, are responsible for developing standard AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 23 AF-wide  promotion  plan  assessments.    An  assessment,  which  is  developed  from  the  job analysis,  measures  characteristics  or  competencies  that  are  important  for  job  performance.  The  Job  Analysis  Panel  Chair  or  equivalent,  and  the  personnel  specialist  ensure  plans  are validated and approved according to OPM requirements and AF guidelines.  (T-0) Approval of  a  promotion  plan  may  be  accomplished  by  the  Career  Field  Functional  Manager,  Job Analysis Panel Chair, or CFT Chief. 2.13.3.1.  Acquisition  related  career  field  team  functional  councils  will  determine  the extent  to  which  their  assessments/promotion  plans  will  include  Acquisition  Corps membership and certification level requirements. (T-1) 2.14.  Certification for Referral. 2.14.1.  Referral will contain the names of all eligible candidates in the best qualified group as identified in the job analysis/assessment.  If an insufficient number of candidates (less than 5) are available in the Best Qualified group, candidates from the next lower quality group(s) can be referred. (T-1) 2.14.1.1.  The  following  directives  address  occupational  unique  criteria  applicable  to individual  career  fields:    AFPD  36-6,  Civilian  Career  Field  Management,  AFI  36-601, Air Force Civilian Career Program Management, and AFMAN 36-606, Civilian Career Field Management and Development 2.14.2.  Employee Reassignments/Change to Lower Grade.  Candidates who voluntarily seek reassignment or change to lower grade must apply for the appropriate vacancy announcement and  may  be  considered  at  the  request  of  the  selecting  official.  Candidates  are  evaluated/ referred IAW established AF procedures. (T-3) 2.14.3.  Competitive Details.  Detailed employees are not required to meet OPM qualification requirements for experience, but must meet any positive education, certification or licensing requirements of the position. (T-0) Job analysis will be used to determine which candidates will be referred for selection for competitive details.  (T-3) Paragraph 2.4.7. describes when a detail may be made non-competitively and when a detail requires competition. AF CFTs do not process competitive details. 2.14.4.  Alternate  Certification.    An  employee  may  be  selected,  absent  full  certification,  if after the full competitive process has been accomplished, the employee has been determined to  be  among  the  group  of  best  qualified  candidates  who  would  have  been  referred  on  a certificate.    This  provision  applies  only  to  in-service  placements.    Candidates  for  centrally managed positions will not be referred by the alternate certification process.  (T-1) 2.14.5.  AF  requires  candidates  be  listed  alphabetically  on  a  referral  certificate;  however, local bargaining agreements may specify other methods of presenting candidates on a referral certificate. 2.14.6.  Candidates  selected  for  ART  positions  must  meet  the  military  and  civilian requirements of the new position.  Military qualifications will be determined by the servicing Military Personnel Section (MPS).  (T-1) 2.15.  Referral Registers/Certificates. 2.15.1.  One-Time Referral Registers.  These registers may be established and used on a one- time  basis  only  to  certify  candidates  to  a  selecting  official  when  a  position  has  unique 24 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 requirements  or  there  are  multiple  identical  vacancies  with  the  same  grade  and  series  to  be filled at the same time.  Otherwise, a 90 day register must be established. (T-0) 2.15.1.1.  All  candidates  must  meet  the  eligibility  requirements  for  the  position  prior  to being  placed  in  the  position.    (T-1)  A  candidate  may  be  referred  within  30  days  of qualifying  for  hard  to  fill  positions.    For  locally  managed  positions  these  will  be identified  by  the  servicing  CPS/OL  or  by  the  appropriate  CFT  for  centrally  managed positions based on prior experience of filling the same or similar positions. (T-2) 2.15.1.2.  All  referral  certificates  will  be  issued  to  the  selecting  official  for  25  calendar days.    Managers  are  encouraged  to  make  selections  and  return  the  certificate  to  the issuing office within 15 calendar days.  Any request for extension beyond the original 25 days is discouraged.  However in those instances where an extension is necessary, it must be  requested  prior  to  the  expiration  date  of  the  certificate  with  the  servicing  staffing specialist and will be limited to 25 calendar days. (T-2) 2.15.2.  90-Day  Registers.    These  registers  may  be  established  when  it  is  anticipated  that several positions with the same title, series, grade, job specialty, and location will be vacant in a 90-day period. 2.15.2.1.  Candidates  within  90  days  of  attaining  full  eligibility  for  placement  in  the position  will  be  entered  on  the  register.    (T-2)  However,  these  candidates  may  not  be certified for placement consideration until they are fully qualified and meet all eligibility requirements.    However,  a  candidate  may  be  referred  within  30  days  of  qualifying  for hard to fill positions. 2.15.3.  AFRC may establish ART referral registers for one-time referral or for indefinite use because  of  the  difficulty  of  locating  and  attracting  eligible  candidates.    If  used  for  a prolonged period, the register must be open at least every 90 days to consider new candidates and employees who have become eligible since the register was previously open.  (T-1) 2.16.  The Selection Process. 2.16.1.  When a referral certificate is issued, the selecting official must review the application package of all candidates referred. (T-0) 2.16.2.  Interviews.  If the selecting official chooses to interview, they may interview one or more  of  the  candidates  on  the  certificate,  with  the  exception  of  military  spouse  preference candidates.    (T-0)  All  candidates  do  not  have  to  be  interviewed  but  for  those  who  are,  the same  interview  questions  must  be  used  for  each  candidate.    (T-0)  Refer  to    1.13.  for information on  GS-14/GS-15 and equivalent levels. 2.16.2.1.  It is recommended that 3 to 5 questions be developed for use in the interview process.    The  questions  should  be  reviewed  for  appropriate  job  relatedness  by  the personnel office or the respective CFT.  Each question used must be job related and tied to  the  KSAs  identified  on  the  core  personnel  document  or  to  the  job  analysis  for  the position  being  filled.    (T-0)  Each  question  should  be  structured  with  three  to  four descriptive anchors with points allocated to each anchor.  This will assist the interviewer in categorizing the responses of the person being interviewed and indicate the degree to which  the  response  meets  the  essence  of  the  question.    In  the  end,  the  strengths  and AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 25 weaknesses of each candidate will be documented to assist the supervisor in making the selection.  (T-2) 2.16.2.2.  When a candidate is not interviewed, the selecting official must document the reasons  for  not  interviewing  and  the  method  used  to  evaluate  the  remaining  candidates (i.e.,  supervisor  inquiries,  past  working  knowledge  of  the  employee).    (T-1)  The documentation and interview questions/responses are maintained by the selecting official, as described in 2.23.4. 2.16.2.3.  AFPC  personnel  will  make  tentative/firm  job  offers  after  audit  of  selections from  referral  certificates.    (T-2)  Selecting  official  must  not  make  tentative  or  firm  job offers to  selectees, except  when the positon  is  a “critical” need position (i.e., Expedited Hiring  Authority,  Direct  Hire  Authority).    (T-1)  For  the  purpose  of  negotiating  salary, selecting  officials  may  extend  tentative  job  offers  for  “critical”  need  positions, conditional  on  final  verification  from  the  CPS  of  eligibility,  priority  clearance,  and  all necessary hiring requirements have been met. 2.17.  Notifying Applicants. 2.17.1.  Applicants  will  receive  an  e-mail  acknowledging  when  their  application  package  is received by AFPC.  (T-0) This is automated through USA Staffing and does not require any manual intervention from the HR Specialist. 2.17.2.  Once  an  applicant’s  initial  eligibility  and/or  qualification  determination  has  been made,  the  HR  Specialist  posting  the  vacancy  announcement  must  request  the  Notice  of Results (NOR) be sent  from USA Staffing to  the applicant  no later than two days  after the closing  date  of  the  vacancy  announcement.    (T-0)  The  NOR  identifies  the  status  of  the applicant’s record to  the effect  that they are qualified and referred;  qualified but  not  within reach  for  referral;  or  not  qualified  based  upon  specific  reasons,  e.g.  lack  of  specialized experience. 2.17.2.1.  If the closing date of the vacancy announcement is extended for any reason, the HR Specialist must request the NOR be sent from USA Staffing to the applicants no later than two days after the new closing date. (T-0) 2.17.3.  Upon issuance of a referral certificate the HR Specialist must immediately initiate a NOR  notifying  the  applicant  of  their  status;  i.e.  referred,  not  referred,  or  ineligible  for referral. 2.17.4.  Immediately  upon  receipt  of  a  returned,  unused  referral  certificate  or  upon  the selection and acceptance of a job offer by a referred candidate, the HR Specialist issuing the referral certificate must also send a NOR to each non-selected candidate advising them they were considered but not selected.  (T-0) 2.18.  Releasing Employees. 2.18.1.  AFPC will establish a tentative entrance-on-duty date based on the following criteria: 2.18.2.  When the selection is  made of  a candidate from the same installation  as the vacant position  the  losing/gaining  supervisors  will  coordinate  the  release  date  with  the  CPS  and AFPC. (T-3) 26 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 2.18.3.  When the selection is made of a candidate from a different location than the vacancy, the  gaining  and  losing  CPS  will  coordinate  the  effective  date  with  the  losing  and  gaining supervisors and the office issuing the referral certificate.  (T-3) When possible, the reporting date will be within 45 days of selection if a permanent change of station (PCS) is involved. Reporting to overseas locations may take longer than 45 days.  (T-3) 2.18.4.  Promotion.  Employees selected for promotion at the same installation as the vacancy will be released by the losing organization so the promotion action may be processed at the beginning of a pay period within 20 calendar days after selection.  The action may be delayed for  administrative  reasons  related  to  the  placement  (i.e.,  physical  examination,  security clearance,  pending  within  grade  increase  (WGI)  within  two  pay  periods,  etc.)  or  at  the employee’s request if approved by both the gaining and losing supervisors. (T-2) 2.18.5.  Reassignment and Employee-Requested Change to Lower Grade.  The effective date for these actions, not requiring a PCS, will normally be the beginning of a pay period within 20 calendar days of selection.  (T-2) No employee may be retained in their current position for more than 20 calendar days if such retention would adversely impact their selection. 2.19.  Temporary Promotions.  The area of consideration for temporary promotions is normally limited  to  an  organization  but  may  be  further  expanded  to  include  the  installation  where  the vacancy exists, as necessary.  If the area of consideration is expanded outside the installation, an employee selected may be temporarily promoted upon agreement between the gaining and losing organizations.  Table 2.5. lists  the instances in which temporary promotions are authorized and specifies the conditions and limitations that apply to each condition. 2.19.1.  Temporary  promotions  for  120  days  or  less  may  be  processed  non-competitively.  Competitive  procedures  apply  when  the  promotion  is  expected  to  exceed  120  days,  be extended beyond 120 days, or made permanent without further competition.  Supervisors are responsible  for  timely  submission  of  extension/termination  requests  of  the  temporary promotion.  The total  period of  the temporary promotion  may not  exceed five  years.  Time spent  on  temporary  promotion  or  detail  to  higher  graded  position(s)  during  preceding  12 month period is counted toward the 120 day-limitation. 2.19.1.1.  For  centrally  managed  positions,  the  CPS  must  notify  the  appropriate  CFT  of temporary  promotions  for  up  to  120  days.    Actions  beyond  120  days,  including extensions, require prior coordination and approval by the respective CFT.  PCS will not be funded for temporary positions. (T-1) 2.19.1.2.  Refer to AFMAN 36-606 for filling career broadening positions by temporary promotion. 2.19.1.3.  Temporary promotions of a civilian deputy to a military chief position may be made  non-competitively  for  up  to  one  year.    Beyond  that  period  the  position  must  be filled using the competitive process. (Table 2.5., Rule 3).  (T-0) 2.19.1.4.  Prior to the effective date of the action, an employee selected for a temporary promotion  must  be  informed  in  writing  of  the  temporary  nature  of  the  promotion,  the reason for time limit, the requirement for competition beyond 120 days where applicable, the  temporary  promotion  may  be  terminated  at  any  time  and  that  the  employee  may  be returned  to  the  position  from  which  temporarily  promoted  or  to  a  different  position  of equivalent  grade and pay  and the return is  not  subject  to  the procedures  in  5 CFR parts AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 27 351, 432, 752 or 771.  If the employee is receiving a retained rate of pay at the time of the temporary promotion, they will also be informed of the effect of the temporary promotion on their retained pay at the time of promotion and upon return to their former grade. (T-0) 2.19.2.  Terminating  Temporary  Promotion.  Table  2.6.  lists  the  placement  actions  that  may be taken when terminating a temporary promotion and the conditions under which they may be made. Refer to AFMAN 36-606 for filling career broadening and CSLP positions 2.20.  Reassignments,  Change Announcement.  Refer to AFMAN36-606 for Centrally Managed positions. to  Lower  Grade  and  Re-promotions  absent  an 2.20.1.  Reassignments  may  be  processed  non-competitively  within  the  Air  Force,  to  a position with no known promotion potential beyond that of the employee’s current position or the grade of a position which the employee has previously held on a permanent basis.  A review  will  be  made  of  the  employee’s  resume  against  the  core  document  for  the  position being  filled.    An  employee  eligible  for  reassignment  must  meet  basic  and  statutory qualification  requirements  for  the  position  to  which  they  are  being  reassigned  or  meet  the requirements of an approved modification of qualifications.  (T-0) 2.20.1.1.  Management-Initiated  Reassignments.  A  selecting  official  may  request  the reassignment  of  an  employee  not  under  their  supervision  with  the  concurrence  of  the losing  organization  and  supervisor,  in  coordination  with  the  personnel  office,  provided the  employee  meets  basic  eligibility  requirements  or  the  requirements  of  an  approved modification of qualifications and the position has no known promotion potential beyond the employee’s current grade or highest grade previously held on a permanent basis. 2.20.1.2.  Management-Directed  Reassignments.    Management  officials  may  direct  the reassignment  of  an  employee  to  a  position  within  their  organization  or  their  line  of command  without  referral  of  other  candidates  provided  the  employee  meets  basic eligibility requirements or the requirements of an approved modification of qualifications and the position has no known promotion potential beyond the employee’s current grade or highest grade previously held on a permanent basis. 2.20.2.  A  voluntary  change-to-lower-grade  (CLG)  at  the  employee’s  request  and  with management coordination may be non-competitively processed provided the employee meets basic  eligibility  requirements  or  the  requirements  of  an  approved  modification  of qualifications  and  the  position  has  no  known  promotion  potential  beyond  the  employee’s current  grade  or  highest  grade  previously  held  on  a  permanent  basis.  The  employee  must acknowledge in writing that the CLG is at the employee’s request. (T-3) 2.20.3.  Re-promotion  to  a  grade  previously  held  on  a  permanent  basis  in  the  competitive service  (or  in  another  merit  system  with  which  OPM  has  an  interchange  agreement)  from which an employee was separated or demoted for other than performance or conduct reasons is  permitted  absent  a  vacancy  announcement.    PPP  may  need  to  be  cleared.    Refer  to  PPP Handbook for approved exceptions. 2.21.  Spouse  Preference  Candidates.  Spouse  preference  eligible  candidates  will  be  referred for consideration in accordance with DoD PPP procedures and Chapter 4 of this Manual.  (T-0)  28 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 2.22.  Employees  Entitled  to  Non-Competitive  Priority  Consideration  as  Corrective Action.  Refer  to  Table  2.3.    When  a  procedural  violation,  regulatory  violation,  or  program violation  is  identified  corrective  action  must  be  taken.    (T-0)    If  the  corrective  action  does  not include  a  requirement  to  vacate  the  position,  an  employee  who  was  not  given  proper consideration  because  of  the  violation  will  be  given  priority  consideration  for  any  position similar to that for which proper consideration was omitted (i.e., same grade and/or target grade) and  provided  the  employee  is  otherwise  qualified.    The  employee  will  be  given  one  priority consideration  for  each  instance  of  omission.    The  employee  will  be  referred  to  the  selecting supervisor  before  referral  of  candidates  from  other  sources  who  are  not  entitled  to  a  higher priority consideration.  Management retains the right to select or non-select the employee.  Since selection  of  these  employees  is  optional,  supervisors  may  request  additional  candidates  before making a final selection. (T-2)  2.23.  Promotion/Referral Records. 2.23.1.  Promotion  Plan.  All  AF  organizations  must  maintain  a  copy  of  the  MPP  (AFMAN 36-203, Chapter 2) and any applicable local supplements and make them available to their employees and management officials. (T-0) 2.23.2.  Safeguarding Promotion/Referral Materials. Information contained in automated data products, and referral certificates may not be disclosed to unauthorized personnel.  Referral certificates  are  electronically  transmitted  to  selecting  officials  and  returned  to  the  issuing office  in  the  same  manner.    Caution  must  be  taken  when  transmitting  and  receiving promotion materials to ensure unauthorized personnel do not inadvertently gain access.  (T-0)  Employees  may  not  be  informed  of  another  employee’s  rank  order  on  a  certificate  or assessment of qualifications against eligibility or ranking criteria. 2.23.3.  Individual  Actions.    Records  of  referral  actions  taken  under  this  plan  will  be maintained and disposed of according to AFI 33-364, Records Disposition –Procedures and Responsibilities. (T-1) 2.23.4.  Records  Maintained  by  Selecting  Officials.    Selecting  officials  will  maintain  all substantive  documentation  related  to  the  consideration  of  competing  candidates.    This  may include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  interview  questions,  notes  on  interview  responses,  record  of contacts  with  previous  supervisors  of  candidates,  non-selection  memos,  notes  on  review  of resumes,  and  any  ratings  or  informal  rankings  made  on  referred  applicants  or  employees. Maintain  this  documentation  for  five  years  from  the  date  of  notification  of  selection/non-selection or until audit completion by OPM, whichever is sooner. (T-0) 2.24.  Promotion  Information  to  Employees.  All  employees  covered  by  this  plan  will  have access to a copy of the plan and any local supplements by requesting it from their organization. 2.24.1.  The employee or applicant, or designated representative, is entitled to be informed of their qualifications for a specific vacancy, and whether they were within the group referred.  (T-0)  However,  the  employee  or  applicant,  or  their  designated  representative,  may  not  be informed  of  the  assessment  of  another  employee’s  qualifications  without  that  employee’s written permission. 2.24.2.  Employees  considered  under  this  MPP  are  also  entitled,  upon  request,  to  full disclosure of the specific criteria in the job analysis/promotion plan. AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 29 2.24.3.  Upon  request,  the  selecting  supervisor  must  inform  the  non-selected  candidates  of the  reasons  for  non-selection.    (T-0)  The  supervisor  must  adhere  to  the  provisions  of  the Privacy  Act  and  may  not  discuss  the  rank  order  or  assessment  of  qualifications  against eligibility or criteria of the candidate selected or any other candidate referred.  (T-0) 2.25.  Keeping  Employees  Informed.  Employees  will  be  informed  annually  by  their  local installation, through published articles, of the principles and procedures outlined in this plan and of OPM and AF directives dealing with the subject of promotion. (T-0)  2.26.  Employee  Complaints.  An  employee,  who  believes  their  application  package  was incorrectly evaluated, incorrectly ranked, or the terms of the promotion plan were not otherwise followed, thereby depriving them of referral consideration, is encouraged to discuss their concern informally  with  the  servicing  personnel  office.    If  the  issue  concerns  the  ranking  and  referral process, the personnel office may contact AFPC or OL servicing team.  If the concern deals with the selection process, the matter should be resolved locally.  If these efforts are unsuccessful, the employee  may  submit  a  formal  grievance  in  accordance  with  the  installation’s  negotiated  or agency grievance procedures.  The other option is for an employee to contact the EO Office, if they  believe  discrimination  has  occurred.    The  aggrieved  person  must  initiate  contact  with  the EO  Office  within  45  days  of  the  date  of  the  alleged  discriminatory  act  or,  in  the  case  of  a personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action. 2.26.1.  Evaluation.  Personnel  offices  must  keep  the  appropriate  CFT  informed  of complaints  concerning  centrally  managed  positions.    Any  corrective  action  involving centrally  managed  positions  must  receive  the  coordination  and  approval  of  the  respective Developmental  Team  Chair  prior  to  final  action.  (T-1)  The  MPP  and  merit  system operations under the plan will be evaluated annually as part of the AF/A1C internal program review.    In  addition,  employee  selection  procedures  will  be  continually  evaluated  in accordance with 5 CFR Part 335 and  appropriate action taken when necessary.    (T-0)  The guidance  contained  in  the  OPM  and  AF  directives  or  policies  will  be  employed  in  all situations not specifically covered by this plan.  (T-0) 2.27.  Evaluation.  The MPP and merit system operations under the plan will be evaluated annually as part of the AF/A1C internal program review.  In addition, employee selection procedures will be continually evaluated in accordance with 5 CFR Part 335 and appropriate action taken when necessary.   (T-0) 2.28.  Omissions.  The guidance contained in the OPM and AF directives or policies will be employed in all situations not specifically covered by this plan.  (T-0)   30 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 Table 2.1.

Assuming there are no mandatory placements, review nature of action proposed and length of assignment.  Apply Table 2.1. to determine if exempt from competition.  Screen local priorities for non-competitive referral (See Note).  If competition is required, proceed to Step 2.    Conduct job analysis and develop the promotion plan.    Based on job analysis, determine qualifications requirements, selective placement factors, if any, screening factors, and ranking factors.  Review established promotion plans to determine whether appropriate or if new plan is justified because of new or unique factors associated with the position.  Consider nature of action, type of position, probable availability of candidates, etc.   Refer employees entitled to priority consideration under competitive procedures.       Refer to Table 2.3.   If no candidates are identified for priority placement or referral, or if all requirements for non-selection have been met, proceed to Step 4.    Identify competing candidates.    Certify from an existing register otherwise, issue an announcement.  Under merit promotion procedures and in applying the competitive process, consider employees entitled to priority consideration serviced by the same personnel office.    Rank competing candidates.    Certify eligible candidates.    All employees in the prescribed area of consideration are screened against initial and basic eligibility criteria.  Those meeting basic eligibility are then ranked and sorted by best qualified criteria as documented on the job analysis/promotion plan and paragraph 2.14.    Determine number to be certified.  Refer allowable number of qualified candidates from the applicant pool including non-temporary employees from other federal agencies and all other candidates eligible for noncompetitive appointment. Candidates on OPM certificates are forwarded for consideration on a separate certificate. NOTE:  CPS determines eligible local priority candidates who will be referred non-competitively prior to applying the full competitive process.      AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 Table 2.3.

It  is  AF  policy  to  design,  administer,  and  support  advancement opportunities  for  lower  grade-level  civilian  employees  throughout  the  DOP.    This  program  is designed  to  help  each  employee  reach  their  full  potential  and  productivity.    Employees  with potential,  but  who  lack  qualifications,  can  be  assisted  in  becoming  qualified  for  current  or projected  positions  through  competitive  selection  with  mission-supportive  job  experience  and job-related training and education.  The guidance provided in this chapter is to be implemented in concert with the Merit Promotion Plan (MPP). 3.2.  Background  .    The  Government  Employees  Training  Act  (GETA),  codified  in  5  USC Chapter  41  is  the  legal  basis  for  establishing  training  and  educational  programs  to  broaden opportunities  for  lower  grade-level  employees.    E.O.  11348  (1967)  as  amended  by  E.O.12107 (1978) provides agency heads and the OPM with additional information on how GETA is to be carried out.  Title 5 CFR Part 410 addresses the general and specific policies and requirements for training in Government agencies. 3.3.  Objectives.  The goals of the DOP are established according to mission and organizational needs as follows: 3.3.1.  To  provide  the  means  by  which  the  capabilities  of  employees  are  increased  to  the fullest extent possible. 3.3.2.  To  provide  employees  with  an  opportunity  to  competitively  enter  bridge  or  career positions and receive planned on-the-job and/or formal training. 3.3.3.  To increase employee morale through these educational and training opportunities. 3.4.  Relationship with Affirmative Employment (AE).  The DOP is an integral part of AE and can  encourage  career  progression  to  ensure  a  diverse  applicant  pool  for  supervisory  and managerial positions. 3.5.  General.  Execution  of  the  Program  requires  the  full  commitment  of  commanders, functional  managers, supervisors, civilian personnel  officers and participants  to  ensure success.  It requires each to strive to apply full use of all aspects of the program in evaluating employee performance, work history, interests, education and potential with developmental opportunities. 3.6.  Responsibilities of Commanders. 3.6.1.  Ensure implementation in conjunction with the MPP. (T-0) 3.6.2.  Ensure  managers  and  supervisors  are  knowledgeable,  trained  and  committed  to  the identification of developmental opportunities and employees with potential. 3.6.3.  Express verbal and written support and commitment to the Program. 3.6.4.  Demonstrate  Program  support  by  providing  adequate  resources  based  on  the availability of funds.   AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 47 3.7.

Identify  positions  which  may  be  restructured  for  fill  through  the  Program  consistent with the needs and mission of the organization. 3.7.2.  Identify KSAs required for each step of the structured position. 3.7.3.  Restructure positions to provide developmental opportunities. 3.7.4.  Counsel and encourage employees to apply for positions under the Program. 3.7.5.  Identify cost-effective training needs. 3.7.6.  Provide periodic evaluation of trainee performance and progression. 3.7.7.  Identify  unsatisfactory  progress  and  discuss  with  the  personnel  office  appropriate action to be taken. 3.8.  Responsibilities of the Civilian Personnel Officer. 3.8.1.  Assist with the design and implementation of the Program. 3.8.2.  Serve as coordinator of the Program. 3.8.3.  Assist  functional  managers  and  supervisors  in  identifying  positions  to  be  filled through the Program. 3.8.4.  Publicize program availability. 3.8.5.  Counsel employees on the opportunities available through program participation. 3.8.6.  Develop and apply appropriate selection procedures. 3.9.  Eligibility.  This  program  applies  to  all  US  citizen  employees  at  GS-1  through  GS-8  and WG-1  through  WG-7  who  are  not  serving  under  a  time-limited  appointment  or  on  a  position targeted to GS-9/WG-8 or above.  Employees serving under excepted appointing authorities may be considered and selected only if their appointment to the target position can be made under the same  appointing  authority  or  if  the  appointing  authority  provides  for  conversion  into  a competitive appointment. 3.10.  Identification of Positions.  The identification of target positions is critical to the success of the program.  It may be necessary to analyze the skills of current employees, review current and  anticipated  position  vacancies,  and  determine  which  positions  may  lend  themselves  to restructuring in support of the program. 3.10.1.  Every position that can be restructured does not need to be included in the Program.  Whether or not a position can be committed to the Program is the sole responsibility of the respective supervisor and should also be predicated upon available training opportunities and organizational workforce capability for overseeing training on the job. 3.10.2.  Once a specific position for which the employee is to be trained has been identified, the  normal  line  of  progression  or  career  ladders  should  be  established.    Target  positions should  be  restructured  to  the  lowest  practical  entry  or  intermediate  grade  levels  with  an identified final target position to accommodate the skills of the selected participant. 3.10.3.  Target positions are normally classified as either career or bridge positions.  Career positions  are  either  positions  which  extend  to  GS-9  or  above  (usually  two-grade  interval 48 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 series)  or  WG  positions  with  journeyman  grades  of  WG-8  or  above.    Bridge  positions  are lead-in  positions  and  provide  qualifying  experience  for  career  positions.    Developmental opportunity  may  encompass  movement  from  support  positions  which  normally  do  not provide  any  opportunity  for  advancement  to  the  GS-9/WG-8  or  above  or  the  experience needed  to  progress  from  other  positions  into  bridge  or  career  positions,  or  movement  from bridge positions into career positions. 3.11.  Implementation. 3.11.1.  Selection  for  placement  into  a  developmental  opportunity  position  is  accomplished through  competitive  methods  as  required  by  AFPD  36-2  and  the  MPP.    (T-1)  Individuals may  be  selected  for  competitive  promotions,  reassignments,  or  changes-to-lower-grade.  Candidates  are  identified  through  self  nomination  under  a  vacancy  announcement  in conjunction  with  any  number  of  competitive  methods:  job  analysis  followed  by  self-assessment, panel interviews, assessment centers or other job-related performance exercises; or  any  combination  of  methods,  e.g.,  locally  developed  self-evaluation  criteria.    The  job analysis provides the basis for any other assessment tool used for identification and selection of candidates. 3.11.2.  Candidates  must  meet  basic  eligibility  requirements,  unless  OPM  qualifications  are modified  as  authorized  under  General  Policies  of  the  OPM  Qualification  Standards.    (T-0) Any  minimum  education,  license,  or  certification  requirements  must  be  met  and  cannot  be waived. 3.11.3.  Employees selected for positions identified under the Program are entitled to pay retention in accordance with AFI 36-802, Pay Setting. 3.12.  Training Agreements.  Training agreements are required when training to be provided is used  as  a  substitute  for  all  or  part  of  the  required  qualifying  experience  (but  not  education, licensing, certification, or other specific credentials), required by the OPM qualification standard for  the  position  series.    Bases  will  develop  training  agreements  including  modification  of qualification  requirements,  where  appropriate,  time-in-grade  exclusions,  and/or  one  accelerated promotion.  (T-1) All agreements are submitted to and approved by the installation commander or designee and must be reviewed annually.  Each training agreement must describe: (T-1) 3.12.1.  Reason for the agreement. 3.12.2.  Position/s covered. 3.12.3.  Selection procedures. 3.12.4.  Length of training for each grade level as required. 3.12.5.  Each  phase  of  training  required;  the  expected  learning  outcome  and  the  means  for measuring the success of the trainee. 3.12.6.  Flexibility provision for the length and intensity of training. 3.13.  Formal  Training  Plan.  A  formal  training  plan  is  required  for  each  employee  on  a training  agreement.    (T-1)  In  all  other  cases,  a  formal  training  plan  may  be  used.    The  plan delineates  the  training  and  developmental  activities  required  to  qualify  for  the  target  position.  The plan should include the following: 3.13.1.  The KSAs needed for successful performance in the target position. 3.13.2.  Objectives and sub-objectives related to the KSAs. AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 49 3.13.3.  Specific training and developmental activities required to  meet  objectives including OJT and formal training. 3.13.4.  Flexibility provisions for the length and intensity of training. 3.13.5.  Target dates for completion of objectives/sub-objectives. 3.13.6.  Provisions for periodic evaluations (daily, weekly, monthly) with a requirement for a written evaluation at the end of each quarter. 3.13.7.  Promotion  phase  points  predicated  on  plan  completion  and  requisite  time  as appropriate. 3.13.8.  Adjustments  that  may  be  made  prior  to  and  during  the  training  process.  (Example: An inventory of skills and abilities of a participant against each phase of the plan may permit a phase to be skipped when the participant already possesses the required knowledge.) 3.14.  Counseling.  The personnel office, along with the supervisor, is responsible for providing counseling  to  assist  employees  in  identifying  their  career  goals,  qualifications,  and  matching these  with  organizational  needs  and  developmental  opportunities.    (T-1)  Counseling  may  be supported by the servicing employee development specialist, affirmative employment specialist, or individuals knowledgeable of staffing procedures and the MPP. 50 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 Chapter 4 MILITARY SPOUSE PREFERENCE PROGRAM 4.1.

Worldwide  for  spouses  of  active  duty  military  members  of  the  US  Armed  Forces, (including  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  and  full-time  National  Guard  or  Reserves)  for  certain appropriated fund positions in the excepted and competitive services in the DoD Components for all GS and FWS positions. (T-0) 4.4.2.  Reciprocally, across DoD Component lines for positions in the same commuting area as that of the new duty station of the military member sponsor. (T-0) 4.4.3.  Spouses eligible for preference must be considered when positions are filled through competitive procedures. (T-0) 4.4.4.  Placement  of  military  spouses  through  this  program  does  not  entitle  the  spouse  to relocation  expenses  under  the  Joint  Travel  Regulations  (JTR),  Department  of  Defense Civilian Personnel or retained grade or pay, unless otherwise entitled. (T-0) 4.5.  Employment  Information  and  Assistance.  Employment  information  and  assistance  will be made available for spouses seeking employment. This includes information provided as part of  a  coordinated  effort  with  the  Individual  Newcomer  Treatment  and  Orientation  (INTRO) program  and  the  Airman  and  Family  Readiness  Center  spouse  employment  assistance  section.  As a minimum, lists of currently established positions should be readily available for review by spouses as an indicator of employment possibilities or recruiting requirements.

Claim  for  Preference.  The  military  spouse  must  be  advised  of  their  entitlement  to  claim spouse  preference  for  DoD  established  positions.    Military  spouses  must  be  advised  of  various 52 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 application  procedures  and  encouraged  to  submit  required  documents  under  all  appropriate options. (T-0) In advising the military spouse, the following information should be conveyed so there is no doubt as to the intent of the program: 4.6.1.  Spouse  preference  shall  be  limited  to  the  specific  position(s)  for  which  registered  in the PPP.  This does not apply for positions in foreign areas.  Refer to 4.6.6.2.  (T-0) 4.6.2.  Spouse employment  preference may be used one time for each permanent  relocation of the sponsor to a new duty location not within the same commuting area. 4.6.3.  Declination  of  a  continuing  position  for  which  the  spouse  has  requested  preference will  serve  as  reason  to  remove  the  spouse’s  claim  for  preference  for  DoD  positions  in  the commuting area of the sponsor’s duty location. (T-0) 4.6.4.  Military spouse preference applies when the spouse has been determined to be among the  “best  qualified”  for  the  position  to  which  referred.    “Best  qualified”  for  preference purposes, means as qualified as the lowest ranking referable candidate. 4.6.5.  Except for those military spouses reached for placement under Direct Hire Authority or from an OPM register, including OPM registers maintained under a Delegated Examining Unit  (DEU)  or  Specialized  Examining  Unit  (SEU)  provisions,  military  spouses  may  be considered  as  preference  eligible  only  if  the  grade  of  the  position  to  which  referred  is  no higher  than  a  grade  previously  held  on  a  permanent  basis  (exception:  EO  13473  allows  for promotion of MSP eligible). 4.6.6.  The  military  spouse  desiring  consideration  at  the  new  AF  location  or  other  DoD activity within the area of the new AF location will claim preference through the procedures established in DoDI 1400.25, v315, Employment of Spouses of Active Duty Military. (T-0) 4.6.6.1.  Military  spouses  should  be  advised  to  claim  preference  according  to  personal employment eligibility as follows: 4.6.6.1.1.  Current AF employed military spouse, 4.6.6.1.2.  Current military spouse employed by another Federal agency, 4.6.6.1.3.  Competitive service reinstatement eligibility 4.6.6.1.4.  Appointment  under  E.O.  12721,  Eligibility  of  Overseas  Employees  For Noncompetitive Appointments 4.6.6.1.5.  Appointment  under  E.O.  13473,  Noncompetitive  Appointing  Authority  of Certain Military Spouses. 4.6.6.1.6.  Required documentation must include an up-to-date employment resume, a copy  of  the  military  sponsor’s  PCS  orders,  and  documentation  confirming appointment eligibility. 4.6.6.2.  A military spouse may also be eligible for preference without civil service status or eligibility under either of the Executive Orders based on derived preference.  Derived preference is a method where the spouse of a veteran may be eligible to claim veterans’ preference when the veteran is unable to use it.  An available veteran may not be passed over to select a non-veteran, nor may an available military spouse preference eligible be AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 53 passed  over  to  select  a  non-spouse  preference  eligible.    Military  spouses  should  be advised of the following: 4.6.6.2.1.  If  certification  of  eligibility  will  be  from  OPM,  from  an  Air  Force Delegated Examining Office (DEU), a Specialized Examining Unit (SEU), or under a Direct  Hire  Authority,  the  military  spouse  must  submit  proof  of  appointment  and preference  eligibility  through  the  application  process.  A  copy  of  an  up-to-date employment  resume,  a  notice  of  rating,  and  the  military  sponsor's  PCS  orders confirming  relocation  to  the  new  active  duty  station  are  the  basic  documents necessary to make the military spouse preference determination. (T-0) 4.6.6.2.2.  In foreign areas, the employment of spouses is governed by DoDI 1400.25 Volume  315,  Employment  of  Spouses  of  Active  Duty  Military,  and  DoDI  1400.25 v1232,  Employment  of  Family  Members  in  Foreign  Areas.  (T-0)  Spouses  may exercise preference through procedures as a competitive service eligible or an eligible under DoDI 1400.25 v1232, for Schedule A appointments.  The military spouse must claim  preference  eligibility  when  submitting  documents  for  consideration  under  the appropriate  vacancy  announcement.    Overseas  commands  may  establish  procedures including  documentation  requirements  to  facilitate  the  consideration  of  spouse preference candidates. Spouse preference may be exercised only once per permanent relocation of the sponsor. 4.7.  Preference  Determinations.  The  personnel  office  makes  preference  determinations  as follows: (T-0) 4.7.1.  Verification  of  Spouse  Status.  Military  spouses  who  entered  into  marriage  prior  to relocating  to  the  sponsor’s  new  active  duty  location  must  be  identified  as  the  spouse  of  a military member relocating under a statutory tour. 4.7.2.  Time Period for Preference.  4.7.2.1.  Military  spouse  preference  eligibility  may  be  used  30  days  before  the  military sponsor’s reporting date to the new duty location.   NOTE:  Spouses seeking preference with  less  than  six  months  remaining  in  the  area  of  the  new  duty  station  will  not  be afforded military spouse preference. (T-0) 4.7.2.2.  In foreign areas, the military spouse preference candidate may file an application for employment 30 days before their anticipated arrival date; however, spouses may not receive preference until actually reporting to the foreign area personnel office. 4.7.3.  Qualification  Determination.  The  military  spouse  preference  eligible  must  meet  the minimum OPM qualification standards and other basic eligibility criteria and must have been determined to be within the best qualified group for a specific position before being referred as a military spouse preference. 4.8.  Documenting  Preference.  When  the  military  spouse  is  employed  based  on  spouse preference,  the  Standard  Form  (SF)  50,  Notification  of  Personnel  Action,  will  cite  the  second authority code and authority according to the applicable chapter of the OPM Guide to Processing Personnel at: http://www.opm.gov/feddata/gppa/gppa.htm.  (T-0) The  Guide appointment. is located  Actions for the  54 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 4.9.  Applying Preference. 4.9.1.  Noncompetitive  Referrals.  Noncompetitive  selections  and  placements  may  be  made without  application  of  military  spouse  preference;  for  example,  reassignment,  change-to-lower-grade,  transfer  (reassignment  and  change-to-lower-grade),  appointment  of  a  30% disabled veteran, VRA appointment, noncompetitive re-promotion, placement based on RPL entitlement  or  Interagency  Career  Transition  Assistance  Plan  (ICTAP)  requirement,  or placement to satisfy ongoing EEO programs according to paragraph 4.3.4. 4.9.2.  Competitive  Referrals.  Veterans’  preference  eligibles  are  considered  first.    Military spouse  preference  eligibles  registered  in  the  DoD  PPP  as  applicable,  will  submit  required documents  and  complete  the  assessment  questionnaire,  against  vacancy  announcements  for consideration  under  MSP.    Those  who  are  not  registered  in  the  DoD  PPP  will  not  receive preference  and will be considered under the applicable  eligibility  for  which applying under the vacancy announcement.  (T-0) 4.9.3.  Targeted  Positions.    When  filling  targeted  positions  preference  applies  only  to  the permanent  target  grade  of  the  position  being  filled.    When  spouse  preference  eligibility  is based  on  prior  civil  service  employment  the  target  grade  for  consideration  cannot  be  any higher than the highest grade previously held in the Federal service by the spouse preference eligible (except for those applying under EO 13473). 4.9.4.  Applicant Rating and Referral.    The spouse preference eligible is rated in  relation to competitive candidates for the position.  A spouse preference eligible who ranks equal to or higher  than  the  lowest  ranking  referable  candidate  is  considered  to  be  in  the  best  qualified group of candidates and as such they will be referred to the selecting supervisor in advance of other  competitive  candidates.    If  the  personnel  office  is  unable  to  contact  the  spouse  after reasonable  documented  attempts  have  been  made  to  verify  availability,  and  the  spouse  has matched  against  the  vacancy  via  PPP,  a  request  to  code  out  the  match  in  ASARS  must  be submitted  to  the  AFPC  PPP  Oversight  Office  to  request  permission  to  bypass  the  MSP match.    If  more  than  one  spouse  preference  candidate  is  in  the  best  qualified  group,  the selecting official may select any of the spouse preference candidates based upon the number of positions being filled. (T-1) 4.9.5.  Military Spouse Interviews.  If a best qualified determination has been made prior to issuance  of  the  referral  list,  interviews  are  not  permitted,  regardless  of  how  many  spouse preference eligible are on the referral certificate. (T-0) 4.9.5.1.  The  only  time  a  military  spouse  may  be  interviewed  is  when  the  results  of  the interviews are factored into the qualification determination process, prior to the issuance of a referral certificate.  Since AF does not use personal interviews as an integral part of the rating and ranking process, Best Qualified (BQ) spouses may not be interviewed. (T-0)  This  policy  does  not  apply  to  interviewing  spouses  in  foreign  areas.    Reference Chapter 14 of the PPP Handbook.  For positions in foreign locations only, the supervisor may  interview  spouses  if  more  than  one  spouse  is  determined  to  be  among  the  BQ  by AFPC. 4.10.  Spouse Preference Registration and Documentation Requirements (  not applicable in foreign areas).  The losing and gaining personnel offices are jointly responsible for managing the registration  of  the  military  spouse  in  the  DoD  Priority  Placement  Program  “S”,  The  Military AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 55 Spouse  Preference  Program.    The  military  spouse  may  register  at  either  the  losing  or  gaining personnel  office.    The  following  documents  must  be  provided  to  and  maintained  by  the registering personnel office and the office performing file maintenance:  (T-0)  4.10.1.  An employment resume. 4.10.2.  A copy of the most recent appraisal, if applicable. 4.10.3.  A  copy  of  the  official  PCS  order  authorizing  the  preference  eligible  spouse  to relocate  with  the  military  member  sponsor  (and  marriage  license  if  MSP  not  listed  on PCS orders) under a statutory active duty tour. 4.10.4.  A  copy  of  the  Program  “S”  registration  form  and  all  documentation  of  any  file maintenance  performed  on  the  military  spouse  preference  candidate’s  Program  “S” registration. 4.10.5.  Any  other  documentation  necessary  to  support  a  claim  for  military  spouse preference.  The  registration  record  must  be  retained  for  a  two-year  period  following placement  or  deletion  as  a  military  spouse  preference  eligible  for  that  duty  location assignment. 56 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 Chapter 5 EMPLOYMENT OF EXPERTS AND CONSULTANTS 5.1.  Authority  .  Policies and procedures for requesting, approving and employing experts and consultants  in  AF  by  appointment  with  or  without  compensation  are  based  on  5  USC  3109, Employment of Experts and Consultants; Temporary or Intermittent. (T-0) 5.2.  Mission Statement  .  The use of experts and consultants is a means of availing the AF of temporary  and  intermittent  services  of  highly  specialized  individuals  to  accomplish  mission requirements which cannot be obtained from in-house personnel or by other appointments.  The authority can be revoked for misuse. 5.2.1.  Employment of Consultants.  When essential to the mission, services of a consultant may be obtained to secure specialized opinions or professional or technical advice that does not  exist  or  is  not  available  within  the  AF  or  the  DoD;  outside  points  of  view  to  avoid  a limited  judgment  of  critical  issues;  knowledge  of  developments  in  industry,  university,  or foundation  research;  opinion  of  noted  experts  whose  national  or  international  prestige  can contribute to the success of important projects; or citizen advisory participation in developing or  implementing  government  programs  that,  by  their  nature  or  statutory  provision,  call  for such participation  A consultant is assigned to operational activities only in rare and unusual cases  when  this  is  the  only  way  they  can  obtain  information  needed  to  formulate  specific advice or recommendations. 5.2.2.  Employment of Experts.  When essential to the mission, services of an expert may be obtained when  expertise does not  exist or is  not  available to  perform work of a specialized nature.    These  services  may  be  obtained  for  a  temporary  or  intermittent  period.    An  expert performs  the  intermittent  or  temporary  work  in  an  operational  activity  which  may  include some  advisory  services.    An  expert  possesses  superior  qualifications  and  a  high  degree  of attainment  and  standing  in  a  professional,  scientific,  technical,  or  other  field.    Their attainment is such that they usually are regarded as an authority or a practitioner of unusual competence and skill by other persons in the profession, occupation, or activity. 5.3.  Authority  to  Employ  by  Appointment  .    All  appointments  and  reappointments  must  be approved  by  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense.    Requests  must  be  submitted  through MAJCOM channels to SAF/AARC for consideration of approval.  (T-0) 5.4.  Conditions of Employment.  An appointment is limited to the specific period for which the need  for  the  employee’s  services  exists.  It  cannot  extend  beyond  365  calendar  days  (a  service year) from the date of the initial appointment; however, a new appointment may be made at the expiration of 365 calendar days.  An appointment initially made for less than 365 calendar days may be extended to the end of that period. (T-0) 5.4.1.  Actual  Workdays.    The  maximum  number  of  workdays  which  may  be  authorized within 365 consecutive calendar days by initial appointment or reappointment is 130.  If less than  130  workdays  is  initially  authorized,  additional  workdays  may  be  authorized  by extending the initial appointment.  Reappointment for one additional year may be authorized. 5.4.2.  With  Compensation.    Compensation  for  experts  and  consultants  cannot  exceed  the daily rate for the maximum payable rate of the GS-15 grade.  The rate of compensation is set AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 57 by  the  selecting  official  with  assistance  from  the  servicing  personnel  office.    The  rate  of compensation is based on:  the value and importance of the services performed; the person’s experience  and  attainments;  and  the  rate  of  compensation  that  may  be  set  on  an  hourly  or daily  basis  as  a  precondition  of  employment.    If  a  daily  rate  is  established,  the  expert  or consultant is paid that rate regardless of the number of hours worked during the day.   If an hourly  rate  is  established,  the  expert  or  consultant  is  paid  only  for  the  hours  worked; however, the actual compensation paid cannot exceed the maximum authorized daily rate of the  GS-15  grade.    Overtime,  night  differential,  holiday,  or  premium  pay  benefits  are  not authorized to be paid to experts or consultants. 5.4.3.  Without  Compensation.    An  expert  or  consultant  may  be  employed  without compensation.  Each such expert or consultant must sign a waiver of compensation to protect the  Government  against  future  claims  for  services  rendered.    The  waiver  must  be  executed before the services are rendered and is retained as a permanent record in the e-OPF. (T-1) 5.4.4.  Security  Requirements.    An  expert  or  consultant  is  subject  to  the  investigative  and clearance  requirements  under  DoD  5200.2,  DoD  Personnel  Security  Program  and  AFI  31-501, Personnel Security Program Management. (T-0) 5.5.  Concurrent  Use  by  Other  Air  Force  Activities.  The services of an expert or consultant may  be  needed  and  used  by  several  AF  activities.    One  AF  activity  may  use  these  services  of another  AF  activity  without  making  a  new  appointment  as  long  as  the  nature  of  the  duties performed, the compensation being paid, and the conditions of the employment  are similar.  In these  circumstances  arrangements  may  be  made  with  the  appointing  AF  activity  so  that  the additional  service  is  reflected  in  the  person’s  appointment  documents  and  records  of  service rendered, and the funds for compensation paid can be transferred between activities. (T-1) 5.6.  Responsibilities  .    The  Directorate  of  Civilian  Force  Management  Policy  (AF/A1C)  and the Directors of Manpower, Personnel, and Services (A1) at the major commands are responsible for  assuring  each  request  meets  the  requirements  of  5  CFR  304,  Expert  and  Consultant Appointments. (T-0) 5.7.  Employment Procedures  . 5.7.1.  When  a  selecting  official  determines  the  need  and  propriety  of  using  an  expert  or consultant’s  services  they  will  submit  the  following  documents  to  the  servicing  manpower, budget, and legal offices for determinations required by DoD 5500.7, Standards of Conduct. 5.7.1.1.

A detailed statement of work indicating the appointee will only be assigned the duties for which the appointment is made.  The statement of work must describe the work to  be  accomplished  in  sufficient  detail  to  determine  that  establishing  a  regular  civil service position is not practical to meet the need. the  circumstances  substantiating 5.7.1.3.  A  description  of impossibility  or impracticability  of  obtaining  equally  qualified  candidates  to  accomplish  the  required work  through  other  methods  such  as  detail,  promotion,  reassignment  of  personnel (civilian  or  military)  within  the  organization  or  activity  concerned  or  recruitment  of someone under civil service procedures. the 58 AFMAN36-203  11 JANUARY 2017 5.7.1.4.  A  resume  or  similar  personal  qualification  statement,  which  is  normally procured  by  the  supervisor  from  the  individual  whose  services  have  been  solicited  to meet the specific need of the organization requiring an expert or consultant. 5.7.1.5.  A  statement  of  employment  and  financial  interests  and  other  determinations required by DoD 5500.7,  Joint Ethics Regulation, such as completion of  an OGE  Form 450, Confidential Financial Disclosure Report or OGE 278, Public Financial Disclosure Report.  5.7.2.  Upon receipt of approval to employ the expert or consultant from the offices identified in paragraph 5.7.1. above, prepare an SF52, Request for Personnel Action (RPA) and forward all documentation to the personnel office. 5.7.3.  The personnel office will accomplish the required employment procedures to procure the expert or consultant for the position. 5.8.  Recording Days of Work.  The selecting official will maintain a current record of the days and  hours  worked  by  each  expert  or  consultant  and  provide  to  the  personnel  office  when  the employee terminates.  This is not required if payroll records provide this information. (T-1) 5.9.  Termination/Extension  of  Appointment  .    When  the  work  of  an  expert  or  consultant  is completed, the selecting official requests termination of the appointment using an RPA.  Offices using such services must make sure the appointee does not work more than the total number of days  authorized  by  the  appointment.    Before  the  appointment  expires,  the  management  official determines  whether  to  terminate  the  appointment  or  to  request  an  extension  or  reappointment.  Each request for reappointment must be submitted to SAF/AARC a minimum of 120 days prior to expiration of the appointment. (T-1) 5.10.  Annual  Communication  Requirement.  5  CFR  Part  304  requires  an  agency  to  comply with  the  statutory  requirements  of  5  USC  3109  and  guard  against  violations  and  inappropriate use of the appointing authority.  AF/A1C will communicate this caution at least annually through electronic mail or by memorandum.  Public Law 102-378 amended 5 USC 3109 to require each agency  to  report  to  OPM  annually  the  number  of  days  worked  and  the  amount  paid  to  each expert or consultant employed during the year.  DCPDS will be used to generate supporting data for the management of the employment of experts and consultants program.
