(T-1) Contact the Civilian Personnel Section (CPS) for guidance if an employee does not meet the minimum period of performance. 5.2. The rating official must prepare an annual performance evaluation, AF Form 860A, Civilian Rating of Record, for each employee meeting the minimum period of performance. (T-1)  The evaluation is prepared between 1-30 April 2017.   5.2.1. Using AF Form 860A, the rating official evaluates performance against the performance elements and standards in the performance plan (AF Form 1003, Air Force Core Personnel Document or AF Form 860, Civilian Performance Plan) and determines if the employee “Meets” or “Does not Meet” the standards for each element and provides an overall performance rating.  If an employee does not have the opportunity to perform an element for the minimum period of performance that element should not be rated and will not be considered in the overall performance rating. 5.2.1.1.

(T-1) 6.3.3.2. A QSI is effective the first pay period on or after the date the rating of record is effective. 6.3.3.3. A QSI and Performance Cash Award cannot be approved for the same period of performance.  An employee will not receive a QSI based in whole or part on performance used to justify another monetary award during the same performance cycle.  A TOA may not be awarded in conjunction with a QSI.  7. Organizations Not certified for DPMAP for 1 April 2017 Implementation 7.1. Implementation for Organizations not certified to include bargaining labor obligations for AF DPMAP implementation on 1 April 2017 will follow the performance management program requirements in this section. (T-0) Once certification requirements are met, the organization will be scheduled for implementation as described in paragraph 2 and where applicable subject to labor management agreements.    7.2. The appraisal pattern is a two-level rating pattern, Summary Level Pattern A, as identified in DoDI 1400.25 Volume 430, Performance Management.  The performance rating levels are Level 3 – “Acceptable” and Level 1 – “Unacceptable.”  7.3. The appraisal cycle is 1 April through 31 March of each calendar year.  The minimum period of performance is 90 calendar days.  If an organization is not certified and scheduled for DPMAP implementation prior to 1 January 2018 the appraisal cycle will conclude on 31 March 2018 and the rating of record effective date will be 1 June 2018. (T-1)   7.4. Performance Planning. 7.4.1. The performance plan contains performance elements and standards and describe management’s expectations based on the requirements of the position description. Performance elements are the critical duties of the position.  Performance standards are written for each performance element and define performance at the “Acceptable” level.  Performance standards address characteristics of performance such as quality, quantity, timeliness and work behaviors.  Performance standards express how well the employee is expected to perform the duties in specific and measurable terms.  7.4.2. Use AF Form 860, Civilian Performance Plan, to prepare tailored performance plans in preparation for developing DPMAP performance plans.  The guidance provided in DODI1400.25Vol431_AFI36-1002, paragraph 3.3.b and 3.3.c will facilitate transition to DPMAP and consistency between performance management program performance plans. The AF Form 1003, Air Force Core Personnel Document (CPD), can be used as a starting point to develop the performance plan on the AF Form 860.  7.4.3. Determining the performance plan elements and standards is a management responsibility; however, the employee should provide input to the supervisor in the development of the performance plan. Before finalizing and signing the performance plan, the rating official should provide the employee an opportunity to review and provide feedback. 7.4.4. The rating official submits the performance plan to the reviewing official for approval and signature.  The reviewing official is the final approval authority and may return the performance plan to the rating official to make changes.  7.4.5. The rating official must discuss the approved performance plan and their expectations with the employee by 30 April or within 30 days of assignment to a position or to newly assigned or changed duties. (T-1)  The rating official explains the performance elements and standards to ensure understanding of the performance requirements and expectations throughout the appraisal period. The employee signs and dates the approved performance plan acknowledging receipt. 7.5. Monitoring Performance and Feedback. 7.5.1. The rating official monitors the performance plan by providing ongoing assessment and feedback to the employee of their performance compared to the performance elements and standards.  Ongoing monitoring and feedback provides the opportunity to assess each employee’s progress in meeting the performance standards and to adjust unrealistic or problematic standards.  7.5.2. At least one formal progress review of the performance plan with the employee must be conducted during the performance cycle. (T-0) Organizations that are not certified to implement DPMAP by the midway point in the performance cycle will conduct a progress review using AF Form 860B, Civilian Progress Review Worksheet. (T-1) The rating official reviews the employee’s performance to date against each performance element and standard in the performance plan and documents the review on AF Form 860B and discusses the review with the employee following the instructions on the form.  The rating official signs and dates the form; employee signature is optional.   7.6. Evaluating Performance. 7.6.1. Organizations that have not implemented DPMAP prior to 1 January 2018 will complete the final 90 days of the performance cycle following the guidance in Section 7 of this AFGM. (T-1)  7.6.1.1. Annual performance evaluation and rating of record process will follow the guidance in Section 5 of this AFGM. (T-1) 7.6.1.2. Rating-based performance awards will follow the guidance in Section 6 of this AFGM. (T-1) 7.6.2. Organizations that implement DPMAP between 1 April 2017 and 1 January 2018 do not complete a rating of record under this section. 7.7. Performance Based Actions. 7.7.1. Unacceptable performance. Efforts to address and resolve performance issues should occur before employee performance on any performance element falls below the “Acceptable” level.  7.7.2. If the employee’s performance declines to less than “Acceptable” on one or more performance elements, the rating official, in consultation with the CPS, will determine whether action is appropriate under Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 432.105, Proposing and Taking Action Based on Unacceptable Performance or AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions, and provide notice of the performance deficiencies.   7.7.3. The rating official must provide assistance designed to help the employee improve his or her performance during an opportunity period to demonstrate acceptable performance. (T-0)   7.7.3.1. The rating official must identify in writing, by preparing a performance improvement plan (PIP), the performance element(s) in which performance is “Unacceptable” and a description of the unacceptable performance; the standards the employee must attain in order to demonstrate “Acceptable” performance; the time allowed for the opportunity to improve; and a statement of the possible consequences of failure to raise performance to the “Acceptable” level during the opportunity period in the PIP. (T-0) The time allowed must be reasonable and commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of the position, typically 30-90 calendar days.  7.7.3.2. If the employee fails to demonstrate performance at the “Acceptable” level despite the PIP, the employee may be subject to reassignment, reduced in grade, or removed from federal service pursuant to Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 432.105, Proposing and Taking Action Based on Unacceptable Performance.     Attachment 1 GLOSSARY OF REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION  References DoDI 1400.25 Volume 430, Performance Management, 5 August 2014 AFPD 36-10, Civilian Performance and Recognition, 23 September 2015 AFI 36-1004, The Air Force Civilian Recognition Program, 29 August 2016 DODI1400.25Vol431_AFI36-1002, Performance Management and Appraisal Program Administration in the Air Force, 15 November 2016  Prescribed Forms AF Form 860, Civilian Performance Plan AF Form 860A, Civilian Rating of Record AF Form 860B, Civilian Progress Review  Adopted Forms AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication AF Form 1003, Air Force Core Personnel Document (CPD)  Abbreviations and Acronyms AD—Administratively Determined CPD—Core Personnel Document  CPS—Civilian Personnel Section DPMAP—Defense Performance Management and Appraisal Program FWS—Federal Wage System  GL— General Law  GP — General Practice GS—General Schedule  PIP—Performance Improvement Plan QSI—Quality Step Increase RB—Rating-based  Terms   Administratively Determined (AD)—A pay plan code used by any agency with an independent authority to administratively determine the rates of pay for any group or category of employees.
