This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty.  In addition, the CFETP provides personnel a clear career path to success.  NOTE:  Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training.  2.  The CFETP consists of two parts supervisors use to plan, manage, and control training within the specialty.  2.1.  Part I:  Provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A provides general information; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each skill level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training, and other); Section D indicates resource constraints; and Section E identifies transition training guide requirements.   2.2.  Part II:  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, core and critical tasks, and correspondence course requirements.  Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements; Section C identifies available support materials (i.e. Qualification Training Packages); Section D identifies the training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included in Section D are both mandatory and optional courses; and Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for associated qualification needs.  At the unit level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  Documentation of training is outlined in section F via the use of the Air Force Training Record (AFTR); this section outlines the format and documentation necessary to maintain an AFTR.  3.

Journeyman 5-Skill Level.  Journeymen may be assigned duties in various functional areas such as general dentistry, dental specialty areas, dental radiology, preventive dentistry, and patient records and reception.  Duty position rotations are necessary to adequately train journeymen; however, rotations should be managed to minimize disruption to patient services and treatment team stability.  Journeymen should strongly consider becoming nationally certified through the Dental Assisting National Board and continue their education towards a Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree.  Journeymen are eligible for special duty assignments such as instructor duty.   5.3.  Craftsman 7-Skill Level.  Craftsmen are expected to be knowledgeable and highly skilled in a wide variety of patient treatment procedures and patient administration duties.  They are the primary trainers of those trainees working toward advancement to the 5- and 7-skill levels.  In addition to assisting in patient care, craftsmen must become knowledgeable on dental practice management as they can expect to fill various supervisory and management positions.  Minimum training times for UGT to the craftsman 7-skill level will be 12 months for normal UGT and 6 months for retrainees.  Continued education through CCAF and higher degree programs is encouraged.  TSgts who have two years time in grade and who have attended the in-residence NCO Academy are highly encouraged to complete the USAF SNCOA by correspondence.  5.4.  Superintendent 9-Skill Level.  Before attaining the 9-skill level, individuals must be SMSgt and have attended the USAF SNCOA in-residence.  A 9-skill level is expected to fill positions such as dental clinic or dental laboratory superintendent.  Additional training and experience in areas of resource and personnel management should be pursued.  Enrollment in higher degree programs is appropriate.   6.  Training Decisions.  This CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Dental Assistant Career Field.  This spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet these training requirements.  The 10  strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  The decisions regarding training within the 4Y0X1/H career fields were made at the Dental STRT meeting, 3 March 2011 and 18 March 2011 with approval of changes done via a virtual utilization and training workshop (U&TW) 24-28 April 2011.  6.1.  An additional Training Decision meeting was held at the request of the new AFCFM to solidify change requests.  There were minor changes made to the CFETP.  The changes have been identified on an addendum to the original STRT document dated 3 March 2011.  7.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon completion of basic military training.  CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate of Applied Science Degree.

This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes beginning 3 Oct 12.    2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Attachment 4, Air Force Training Program Career Field Education and Training, this STS:   2.1.  Lists in column 1, the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TRs) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, 7-skill level.  TRs in the source summary are commercial publications or other service publications that are essential for OJT and mission accomplishment and are referenced by title throughout the STS.  The unit OJT section will consolidate the requirements for the unit they support and order publications through the medical group/clinic library activity.  2.2.  Uses the numbers 5 or 7 in column 2A, to identify core tasks required for upgrade to the 5- and 7-skill levels respectively in the dental assistant specialty.  Personnel must be trained on appropriate core and duty tasks to complete upgrade training.  Not all tasks require third party certification. The symbol “X” in column 2B identifies critical tasks; these are the only tasks that require third party certification.   2.3.  Provides certification for OJT.  Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Use automated training management systems, if available, to document technician qualifications.  Task certification must show a certification or completion date.   NOTE:  Trainers must (1) possess a 4Y0XX AFSC or DoD equivalent, (2) be qualified on the tasks they will train, (3) be recommended by their supervisor, and (4) have completed the Air Force Training Course.  Certifiers must (1) be at least a SSgt or civilian equivalent, (2) possess a minimum of 5-skill level, (3) have completed the Air Force Training Course, and (4) be trained and/or certified on tasks they will certify.  The certification official must be someone other than the trainer.  Licensed/credentialed healthcare providers may substitute as trainers and certifiers without attending the Air Force Training Course.  If the trainer is a licensed/credentialed provider, they may serve as both the trainer and certifier.  2.4.  Shows in column 4, formal training, correspondence course and QTP requirements.  It also shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the trainee as a result of training on the task and career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.  For a list of QTP volume numbers and titles, refer to Section C.  Note: Training codes in columns 4B2 and 4C2 reflected for 5 and 7-skill levels indicate the information provided in the CDCs.  These codes are not intended to reflect the level required to satisfy OJT upgrade requirements.  2.5.  Identifies qualification requirements.  The proficiency code key indicates the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses. 19   2.6.  Is used to document training in the Air Force Training Record.  Refer to AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, Chapter 6, Air Force On-The-Job Training Administration for further guidance on documentation, transcribing, decertification, and recertification.  2.7.  Is used as a performance standard.  Tasks are trained and qualified to the “Go” level. “Go” means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures (“Go” level equates to 3c in the STS proficiency code key).  2.8.  Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) for the dental career field are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron, by dental SNCOs with extensive practical experience in their career field.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard.  3.  Recommendations.  Identify inadequacies and recommend changes to this training standard through channels at 937 TRG/TTS, 2931 Harney, Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 or use the Customer Service Information Line, DSN 420-1080 (Commercial 210-808-1080) to report your findings.

There are currently no MAJCOM unique requirements.    Section F - Documenting Training  8.  The Air Force Training Record (AFTR).   8.1.  The AFTR is an enterprise-wide custom training management system designed to replace the paper-based training records system.  It is the electronic equivalent of an Air Force Form 623 and will be used by career fields within the Air Force Medical Service to document all training actions.  The AFTR allows training plans to be established by:   45  8.1.1.  Career Field/Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)  8.1.2  Duty position/team member.  8.1.3  Any group of tasks that require management, tracking, and documentation.  8.1.4  Trainee/trainer/certifier.   8.2.  The AFTR components managed by the supervisor are:  8.2.1.  Master Task List (MTL).  The MTL is a list containing all tasks that are to be trained in a work center and is often broken out by specialty.  The MTL consists of the STS; AF Form 623 Parts II and III; AF Forms 797 and 1098 tasks; and Qualification Training Packages (QTP).  The supervisor creates the MTL by selecting tasks from the Unit Task List (UTL) produced by the Unit Training Manager and the STS.  8.2.2.  Master Training Plan (MTP).  The MTP is a list containing a schedule of training for all tasks within a particular duty position.  The MTP consists of the STS; 623 Parts II and III; AF Forms 797 and 1098 tasks; and QTPs.  The supervisor creates the MTP by assigning training times and methods to tasks in the duty position.  Refer to AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program and AFH 36-2235, Volume 11, Information for Designers of Instructional Systems Application to Unit Training for guidance in developing the MTP.   8.2.3.  Duty Task List (DTL).  The DTL is a list containing all the tasks to be trained on in a duty position.  The DTL consists of the STS; AF Form 623 Parts II and III; AF Forms 797 and 1098 tasks; and QTPs.  The supervisor creates the DTL by selecting tasks from the MTL.  8.2.4.  Individual Training Record (ITR).  All training is documented in the ITR.  This is the electronic version of the former Enlisted Training and Competency Folder.  The ITR is made up of the AF Form 623 Parts I, II and III; AF Forms 623a, 797, 803 and 1098; QTPs and the Job Qualification Standard (JQS).  This record is automatically populated based upon the duty position the individual is assigned to.  Refer to AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, for guidance in documenting training on the various forms contained within the ITR.  Maintenance of the CFETP is mandatory for all MSgts and below assigned to dental facilities.   8.2.4.1.  The AFTR provides the capability to incorporate training source documents and/or to manually enter completed training into the ITR.  The following documents will be incorporated into the ITR:  8.2.4.1.1.  The member’s initial MTF and clinic orientation checklists.  8.2.4.1.2.  A copy of career field-relevant training certificates or certifications/licenses, such as dental short course certificates, Dental Hygiene License, or Certified Dental Assistant/Certified Dental Laboratory Technician certifications.   8.2.4.1.3.  Recurrent training such as BLS, HIPAA, and RSV training.    46  8.2.4.1.4.  AF Form 2096, Classification On-The-Job Training Action.    8.2.4.1.5.  AETC Form 156, Student Training Report.  AETC Form 156 documents the level of success, strengths, and weaknesses that a student demonstrated during technical school.  It is emailed to the base training manager shortly after the graduate arrives at his/her duty station.  This form is maintained in the record until 5-skill level upgrade training is complete.  8.2.4.1.6.  AF Form 803, Report of Task Evaluation.  AF Form 803 is used to conduct and document completion of task evaluations during training site visits, when directed by the commander, or when a task certification requires validation.    8.2.4.1.7.  Other forms as appropriate.  Section G - Samples of ITR Documentation  9.  The following are sample forms available in AFTR to document enlisted training.    9.1  AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS.

I have been assigned as his supervisor and trainer and will orient TSgt Doe to the squadron using the Dental Squadron Orientation checklist, dated 20 May 06, located in the Master Training Plan.  An initial interview was accomplished on this date.  TSgt Doe currently has no disqualifiers that would delay his orientation/training.  TSgt Doe stated that his goals during the orientation process were to learn as much as possible and to question the trainers when he was not clear as to the training provided.  TSgt Doe seems to be very enthusiastic about working in the Clinical Dentistry Flight and has expressed his desire to take on any challenges that the trainers have to offer.  An initial evaluation was conducted.  Additional training is needed to meet the work centers position task qualifications.  The training plan for TSgt Doe has been adjusted to accomplish this training.  [Or] TSgt Doe was previously qualified on required work center tasks.  These qualifications will be re-verified prior to release from unit orientation.

Anthony is entering upgrade training to the 5-skill level effective this date.  She has been briefed on the On-The-Job Training (OJT) Program and how she fits into the program while in upgrade training (UGT).  Upgrade training was explained as a dual-channel process designed to qualify an Airman for skill level upgrade.  Dual-channel OJT is a systematic reportable application of self-study and the craftsman/apprentice principle.  Trainees acquire job qualification while performing on the job under supervision.  This combination, knowledge and job position qualification constitutes the dual-channel concept.  Requirements from AFI 36-2101 and 36-2201 were covered.  AF Forms 623, 623A, 797, 2096, and the CFETP, STS/JQS or automated JQS, which serves to make up the individual training record, were explained.  Responsibilities of the commander, base training, unit education and training manager (UTM), immediate supervisor, trainer, and trainee were discussed.  The career development course (CDC) was briefly discussed and will be explained in detail when the CDC arrives.  Requirements for upgrade to AFSC 4Y051 are: (1) satisfactory completion of CDC 4Y051 A&B (2) satisfactory completion of all appropriate skill level core and duty related tasks; and (3) supervisor recommendation for upgrade.  Each Airman in grades E-1 through E-7 has an AF Form 623, and CFETP or JQS.  The CFETP or JQS contains most duty related tasks and should be annotated to show training has or is occurring in those tasks the Airman is required to perform in his/her current duty position, all mandatory upgrade requirements, and core task requirements.  In the CFETP, the trainer, trainee, and certifier (as applicable) have a space to initial when training is completed.  After upgrade, the CFETP or JQS will continue to be used to document further qualification training.  //Signed//    SUSAN ANTHONY, AB, USAF  Dental Assistant                         //Signed//  JANE DOE, TSgt, USAF  NCOIC, Clinical Dentistry Flight   Figure 9-5, Sample, Initial Upgrade Training Orientation 51  ON-THE-JOB TRAINING RECORD CONTINUATION SHEET TRAINEE'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR COMPLETING CDCs 1.
