Other manuals in this series are FM 10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A and FM 55-450-5/FMFRP 5-31, VOL III/NWP 42-1,VOL III/AFR 50-16, VOL III/COMDTINST M13482.4.     These manuals are a coordinated effort of the US Army, US Marine Corps, US Navy, US Air Force, and USCoast Guard.  All services participate in the sling load certification program begun by the Army in 1984.  Thesemanuals include standardized rigging procedures and other information from that program.  Chapters 2 through 14contain rigging procedures for single-point loads which have been certified for sling load.  Chapters 15 through 24contain rigging procedures which have not been certified but have demonstrated acceptable static lift and flightcharacteristics during a flight test.     Efforts were made to standardize ground crew and hookup procedures and terminology.  Where service-uniquerequirements apply to an entire chapter or body of text, the service initials are at the beginning of the chapter or text.Otherwise the initials are at the end of the applicable sentence.     Rigging equipment and procedures described in this manual may not be authorized for all aircraft or servicesbecause of equipment or service restrictions.DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTION:  Approved for public release;  distribution is unlimited.*This publication supersedes FM 55-450-4, 11 February 1991.MARINE CORPS PCN:  14400003900iFM  10-450-4/MCRP 4-23E, VOL II/NWP 3-04.12/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL II/COMDTINST M13482.3A      The proponent of this publication is HQ TRADOC.

INTRODUCTIONThis chapter contains general information about certifi-cation for helicopter sling load and explains the role ofthe  Military  Traffic  Management  Command  Transpor-tation  Engineering  Agency  (MTMCTEA)  and  the  De-partment of Defense (DOD) sling load certification au-thority.  This authority rests with the US Army NatickResearch,  Development,  and  Engineering  Center(NRDEC).    This  chapter  also  explains  the  informationcontained in the equipment rigging procedures and givessome general rigging instructions.1-2. CLASSIFICATION DEFINITIONS OF SLING        LOADSa.  Certified  Sling  Loads.    Certified  sling  loads  arethose  items  of  equipment  and  their  associated  riggingprocedures  which  have  completed  the  evaluation  andtesting required by NRDEC for sling load certification.These rigging procedures are in Chapters 2 through14.Only certified sling loads are authorized for the MarineCorps.  The US Army NRDEC has indicated that any singlepoint sling load certified under a specific aircraft is alsocertified for any aircraft with suitable lift capability.  Thefollowing restrictions apply for sling load certification toremain in effect:(1)  The load must be within the lifting capability ofthe desired helicopter model and not exceed the rated ca-pacity of the sling set being used.(2)  The load shall be rigged in accordance with thecertified rigging procedure.(3)  The recommended stable airspeed specified forthe load in the applicability section of the rigging proce-dure is a recommendation and not a restriction, unless sostated.CAUTIONLoads weighing less than 6,000 pounds maynot fly in a stable condition and may incur jet-tisoning problems when flown under a CH-53Ehelicopter.  CH-53E units may have restrictionson flying light loads.  Direct coordination withCH-53E units is encouraged.b.  Suitable Sling Loads.  Suitable sling loads are thoseitems of equipment and their associated rigging proce-dures that have not been certified but have demonstratedacceptable  static  lift  and  flight  characteristics  during  aflight test.  In most cases these loads were not pull testedin accordance with MIL STD 913, but are known loadswhich  have  been  flown  without  incident  for  years  andwhich NRDEC considers to be proven safe.  These rig-ging procedures are in Chapters 15 through 24.c.  Unique Sling Loads.  Unique loads are equipmentcarried  on  a  one  time  or  low-frequency  basis,  such  astelephone poles, artillery targets, or barrier material.  Thelack of sling load certification in itself does not preclude aunit commander from carrying a load that is not certified.Each service is responsible for determining its policy oncarrying loads that have not been certified for sling load.d.    Prohibited  Sling  Loads.    Prohibited  sling  loadsare  items  of  equipment  that  are  prohibited  from  slingloading as determined by each service.  These loads havebeen denied sling load certification and are a safety haz-ard if carried.  They have either structural deficienciesor  have  exhibited  unstable  flight  characteristics  duringflight testing.  Each service will identify these loads andtransmit this information by separate list. Contact yourservice point of contact identified in the Preface if youhave any questions regarding the classification of a par-ticular load.(4)  This certification is limited to single-point loadsonly.1-3.  CERTIFICATION OF EQUIPMENT FOR       HELICOPTER SLING LOADNOTE:  When carrying loads at weights close to the air-craft hook limitations, close coordination with the avia-tion unit is required.a.  Objective.  The objective of helicopter sling loadcertification is to assure the user that the equipment being1-1FM 10-450-4/MCRP 4-23E, VOL II/NWP 3-04.12/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL II/COMDTINST M13482.3Atransported  can  withstand  the  stresses  of  a  sling  loadflight environment.  Certification for sling load assuresthe user that the item has met minimum standards for struc-tural integrity and that the associated rigging procedureshave been developed specifically for that item.b.    Responsibilities.    Within  the  US  Army,  theMTMCTEA is responsible for transportability approvalof developmental equipment.  Within the DOD, NRDECis the lead activity responsible for providing sling loadcertification and rigging procedures for military equip-ment.  When an item is certified for sling load, it meansthat NRDEC, in cooperation with various test activities,has:(1)    Conducted  an  engineering  analysis  of  the  loadand lifting provisions for structural adequacy during slingloading.(2)  Verified that the lift provisions meet the strengthrequirements  of  the  applicable  military  standard  bymeans of proof load testing.(3)  Developed and/or validated sling load riggingprocedures through static lift testing.(4)  Evaluated flight test reports and determined thatthe  particular  load  meets  acceptable  flight  characteris-tics with the type helicopter flown during the flight test.(5)  Issued a statement of sling load certification forthe  particular  load,  including  load  configuration(s),weight(s),  types  of  helicopter(s),  and  maximum  stableairspeed(s) as attained during the flight test(s).  Certifi-cation  is  valid  only  for  the  conditions  specified  in  therigging  procedures.1-4.  REQUESTS FOR SLING LOAD CERTIFI-     CATIONa.    Fielded  Equipment.    Each  service  headquartersmust designate, request, and prioritize the fielded equip-ment to be evaluated by NRDEC for sling load certifi-cation. Individual units can request sling load certifica-tion for fielded equipment through the appropriate ser-vice agency which will add the item to the prioritized list.The NRDEC will evaluate the equipment on a priority ba-sis.  The following agencies are responsible for their branchof service:1-2(1)  US Army - Commander, Combined Arms SupportCommand, ATTN: QM Combat Developments, Suite 250,3901 A Avenue, Fort Lee, VA  23801-1809.(2)   US Marine Corps - Commanding General, Ma-rine Corps System Command (PSE) Quantico, VA 22134-5021.(3)    US  Navy  -  Naval  Air  Systems  Command(NAVAIR).(4)  US Air Force - US Air Force Systems Command.b.  Previously Certified Single-Point Loads.  Orga-nizations can request certification for single-point loadstransported by helicopters not listed in the applicabilityparagraph of the certified single-point load rigging pro-cedure.  The procedure for certifying a single-point loadfor sling load under a different helicopter from that listedin the applicability paragraph is as follows:(1)  Contact your service point of contact to deter-mine  if  the  load  has  been  certified  with  the  differenthelicopter subsequent to the manual publication.(2)  Obtain a multiservice flight data collection sheet(MSFDCS) from Commander, NRDEC, ATTN: STRNC-UAS, Natick, MA 01760-5017.(3)  Following the steps in the MSFDCS, conduct aflight  test  for  the  item  using  the  certified  single-pointrigging procedures in this manual.(4)  Complete the MSFDCS and return it to NRDEC.NRDEC will evaluate the completed MSFDCS and cer-tify the item as appropriate for the specified helicopter.c.    Previously  Certified  Dual-Point  Loads.    Loadscannot  be  certified  for  dual-point  lift  based  on  previ-ously certified dual-point rigging procedures because ofthe differences in dual hook helicopters, such as the dis-tance between the two cargo hooks.  Rigging proceduresfor dual-point loads must be developed and/or approvedby NRDEC before the test flight.1-5.  UNIQUE ITEMS OF EQUIPMENT OR       OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTSHelicopter sling loading of unique items, due to opera-tional requirements, will be at the discretion of theFM 10-450-4/MCRP 4-23E, VOL II/NWP 3-04.12/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL II/COMDTINST M13482.3Acommander.  Equipment not listed in this manual shouldbe static lifted (when possible) by a crane to determineproper  rigging  and  stability  characteristics.    Personnelthoroughly  familiar  with  sling  load  rigging  proceduresshould assist in the static lift testing.  Flight testing maybe conducted after a satisfactory static rigging configu-ration has been determined.NOTE: Low density equipment with low weight andlarge  surface  area  (flat  surfaces),  such  as  shelters,empty trailers, pallet loads, and empty fuel or waterdrums, are likely to become extremely unstable whenflown during sling load operations, even at low air-speeds, and should be flown with extreme caution.1-6.  EQUIPMENT RIGGING PROCEDURESThis section explains the information that is containedin  the  rigging  procedures  for  each  load.    Chapters  2through 14 contain the rigging procedures for certifiedsingle-point loads and chapters 15 through 24 contain therigging procedures for suitable single-point loads.a.  Applicability Paragraph.  The applicability para-graph states whether a load is “certified” or “suitable” forsling load.  It also contains the helicopter types and rec-ommended maximum airspeeds for each helicopter type.For certified loads, this airspeed is the maximum airspeedattained by the helicopter during the test flight before theload became unstable or before the aircraft power require-ments were exceeded.  For suitable loads, the maximumrecommended airspeed is based on previous experiencewith this helicopter/load combination.  For either certi-fied or suitable loads, the airspeed listed is a recom-mendation and not a restriction, unless so stated.  Theaircrew  should  closely  monitor  the  load  during  theflight, especially if the helicopter exceeds the recom-mended maximum airspeed.b.  Load Description.  The load description paragraphidentifies the load, model, national stock number (NSN)or other identification, and the weight of the load for cer-tification.(1)  The actual weight of the equipment may vary some-what from the actual  rigged weight during the flight testdue to equipment modifications, fuel, equipment added tothe load, or different models of the same item.  The loadweight on the equipment data plate or in the operator’smanual  takes  precedence  over  the  load  weight  in  thismanual.  Weigh the load if there is any doubt about itsactual weight.  If the load weight exceeds the weight listedin  the  load  description  paragraph,  the  load  becomes  aunique load.  Contact your service point of contact if youhave any questions about the load description or weight.(2)      Equipment  such  as  cargo    trailers  and  cargotrucks  contain  descriptions  of  the  allowable  additionalcargo  weight.    Do  not  exceed  the  fully  loaded  weight.Some trailers become extremely unstable at low weights;therefore, a minimum weight is identified.  If your traileris below that weight, add more cargo or dummy weightas close to the center of the trailer as possible until youreach the minimum weight.c.  Preparation.  The preparation steps are intended toreduce the possibility of damage to the equipment causedby sling leg entanglement during the hookup and lift-offoperation or by wind resistance encountered during theflight.  Since these preparation steps are not directive innature,  the  commander  assumes  responsibility  for  anydamage to the equipment caused by deviation from thepreparation  steps.d.  Rigging.  The rigging steps give information as tothe position of the apex fitting on the load, routing ori-entation of the sling legs, location of the lift provisions,chain link number for each sling leg, and steps requiredto  prevent  the  sling  legs  from  becoming  entangled  onthe load.  Do not change the chain link number in therigging  procedures  under  any  circumstances  as  it  maychange sling leg loading and cause lift provision failure.(1)   The purpose of the illustration accompanying therigging  procedures  is  to  depict  what  a  properly  riggedload  looks  like  with  the  slack  removed  from  the  slinglegs.  The arrow identifies the direction of flight.(2)   Appendix A contains NSN component listingsfor slings, sling sets, cargo nets, and other miscellaneousequipment and materials.   e.  Hookup.  Certain sling loads, such as HMMWVs withshelters, present substanial risk of damage to the load orinjury to the hookup personnel.  This risk is increasedduring dual point hookup or night operations.      (1)  To reduce the risk of damage to the load or injury1-3FM 10-450-4/MCRP 4-23E, VOL II/NWP 3-04.12/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL II/COMDTINST M13482.3Ato the hookup personnel an extended sling system or  reachpendant as defined in FM 10-450-3 may be used.the sling set near the load.  The sling legs for a typical loadwith four lifting points are routed as shown in Figure 1-1.      (2)  Using a reach pendant increases the distance be-tween the load and the helicopter.  Reach pendants shouldnot be used on loads that have a tendancy to spin duringflight.    A  static  discharge  person  is  not  required  whenusing a reach pendant.      (3)  If the tactical environment permits the use of anextended sling set may reduce the risk.  Polyester roundslings are recommended for use as vertical pendants.1-7.  GENERAL RIGGING INSTRUCTIONSCAUTIONInspect lifting provisions and supporting struc-ture for damage or degradation prior to slingloading.  Do not transport loads with damagedor degraded lift provisions.a.   Preparing the Load.  Prepare the load to be trans-ported by following the preparation and rigging instruc-tions for each item.  Typical preparation instructions willprovide information to secure loose items, remove or se-cure  canvas  covers,  and  remove  obstructions,  such  asantennas.  Place protective padding on windshields andother components that could be damaged by the metalparts of the sling set during hookup or release.  The loadshould be secure enough to withstand winds in excess of120 knots caused by the forward airspeed of the aircraft.If possible, position the load in the takeoff direction sothe pilot does not have to pick the load up and then turnthe aircraft into the takeoff direction.b.  Preparing the Equipment.  Inspect and assemblethe slings and miscellaneous equipment required to pre-pare and rig the load.  Following the instructions in Chap-ter  6  of  FM  10-450-3/MCRP  4-23E,  VOL  I/NWP  3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A,add or remove sling legs, chains, or apex fittings as re-quired.  Never exceed the capacity of the sling legs or apexfitting/web ring.  If you have a sling set with a highercapacity than the sling set prescribed, use the chain linkconversion chart in Appendix B to determine the corre-sponding chain link for your sling set.c.  Positioning and Attaching the Sling Set.  Position1-4(1)  Rigging a typical load with four lifting pointsis begun by connecting -(a)  Sling leg 1 to the left front lifting provision.(b)  Sling leg 2 to the right front lifting provision.(c)  Sling leg 3 to the left rear lifting provision.(d)  Sling leg 4 to the right rear lifting provision.(2)  If a six-leg sling set is required, the innermostsling  legs,  5  and  6,  are  connected  to  the  left  and  rightmiddle lift provisions.NOTE:  Odd numbered sling legs go to the same side ofthe load.(3)   Following the equipment rigging procedures, loopthe free end of the chain end through the lift provisionand insert the specified chain link in the grabhook/grablink.  Tie or tape the excess chain end to prevent the unre-strained chain from damaging the load.  If necessary, wrappadding  around  the  chain  or  rope  assembly  to  preventdamage to the load or sling set.  If the procedures pre-scribe a spreader bar, install and pad  it according to therigging instructions.(4)  Breakaway safety ties are used to temporarily re-strain the sling legs to keep them from becomingentangled  on  the  load  as  the  helicopter  lifts  the  load.These  safety  ties  are  made  of  Type  I,  1/4-inch  cottonwebbing or duct tape.d.  Viewing the Load.  Left, right, front, and rear direc-tions are designated from the driver’s perspective for ve-hicles and towed equipment.  Howitzer gun tubes are con-sidered the front of the load.  The front or rear is identi-fied on other items of equipment.  The sling leg number-ing system prevents sling legs from crossing each otherand causing damage to the sling legs or causing the loadto twist in flight.  To improve flight stability, some loadsare transported backwards.  Do not confuse the front ofthe load as it is carried with the end designated as thefront for rigging purposes.  The arrow shown in  the illus-tration identifies the direction of flight.FM 10-450-4/MCRP 4-23E, VOL II/NWP 3-04.12/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL II/COMDTINST M13482.3A1342Figure 1-1.

INTRODUCTIONThis chapter contains rigging procedures for single-pointwheeled vehicle loads that have been certified for slingload.  Each rigging procedure is found in a paragraph thatincludes a description of the load, materials required forrigging, and steps to complete the procedure.  An applica-bility paragraph is also a part of each paragraph and iden-tifies the certified loads.  The certified single-point riggingprocedures for wheeled vehicles are in this section.  Para-graphs 2-2 through 2-28 give detailed instructions for rig-ging loads.NOTES:1.  Reach Pendants may be used on all singlepoint loads.  A static discharge person is not requiredwhen using a Reach Pendant.2.  Canvas tops and doors should be removed andstowed inside the vehicle if time allows.  These items maybe damaged if the airspeed exceeds 100 knots.2-2.  M996/M997/M997A2  Truck, Ambulance, (HMMWV)a.  Applicability.

The following procedures apply tothis load:(1)  Preparation.  Prepare the load using the followingsteps:(a)  Fold the mirrors forward in front of the wind-shield and tie together with Type III nylon cord.  Tape thewindshield in an X formation from corner to corner.(b)  Remove the spreader bar from under the right-hand seat inside the ambulance.(c)  Secure all equipment inside the rear compart-ment with tape, nylon cord, and/or lashings.  Close andsecure the door.(d)  Secure all other equipment inside the vehiclewith tape, nylon cord, and/or lashings.  Close and securethe doors.(e)  Make sure the fuel tank is not over 3/4 full.  In-spect  fuel  tank  cap,  oil  filler  cap,  and  battery  caps  forproper installation.(f)  Engage the vehicle parking brake.  Place the trans-mission in neutral.(g)    Make  sure  that  the  front  wheels  are  pointedstraight ahead.  Tie down the steering wheel using thesecuring device attached under the dashboard.(h)  Secure the Red Cross insignia covers in the closedposition.(i)  Remove the keeper from the spreader bar andextend  the  bar  so  the  holes  line  up.    Reinstall  pin  andengage keeper.  Use the sighting hole in the tube to assistin aligning holes for the pin.  See top view insert in Figure2-1.(j)  Position the spreader bar across the rear end ofthe vehicle roof.  Attach the spreader bar check cables tothe eyebolts located on the aft exterior sidewall of the rearcompartment.  See rear view insert in Figure 2-1.(k)  Install lift provisions on the outer ends of therear bumper by removing the tie-down provisions locatedinboard of the bumper ends and installing them on theouter ends of the rear bumper, if necessary.(2)  Rigging.  Rig the load according to the steps inFigure 2-1.NOTE:  Hookup of this load presents substantial riskof damage to the load or injury to the hookup personnel.Use of a reach pendant is recommended for this load.(3)  Hookup.  The hookup team stands on the roof ofthe vehicle.  The static wand person discharges the staticelectricity with the static wand.  The hookup person placesthe apex fitting onto the aircraft cargo hook.  The hookupteam then carefully dismounts the vehicle and remainsclose to the load as the helicopter removes slackfrom the sling legs.  When successful hookup is assured,the hookup team quickly exits the area underneath thehelicopter to the designated rendezvous point.(4)  Derigging.  Derigging is the reverse of the prepa-ration and rigging procedures in steps d (1) and d (2).2-2FM  10-450-4/MCRP 4-23E, VOL II/NWP 3-04.12/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL II/COMDTINST M13482.3ARIGGING STEPS1.   Position apex fitting on top of the ambulance.  Routeouter sling legs 1 and 2 to the front of the vehicle andinner sling legs 3 and 4 to the rear.  Sling legs 1 and 3must be on the left side of the load.2.  Loop the chain end of sling leg 1 through the leftfront lift provision that protrudes through the hood.  Placethe correct link from Table 2-1 in the grab hook.  Repeatwith sling leg 2 and the right front lift provision.3.

Personnel.   Two persons can prepare and rig thisload in 20 minutes.d.  Procedures.   The following procedures apply to thisload:(1)  Preparation.  Prepare the load using the followingsteps:(a)  Prepare the launcher  for general travel accordingto the operator's manual.(b)  Secure all doors and vents with tape or Type IIInylon cord.(c)  Secure all safety chains and hoses to the trailerframe with tape or Type III nylon cord.(3)  Hookup.  The hookup team stands on the launcheron  each  side  of  the  pedestal.    The  static  wand  persondischarges the static electricity with the static wand.  Thehookup person places the apex fitting onto the aircraftcargo hook.  The hookup team then moves clear of thehelicopter but remains close to the load as the helicopterremoves  slack  from  the  sling  legs.    When  successfulhookup is assured, the hookup team quickly exits the areaunderneath the helicopter to the designated rendezvouspoint.     Due to the relatively small clearance between thetop of the load and the helicopter during hookup, it maybe desirable for the helicopter flight engineer to make thehookup using the cargo loading pole (shepherd's hook).Place the apex fitting on top of the center launch boom,with the pin facing up.  Ground crew must stand by toensure  the  sling  legs  do  not  become  entangled  on  theload.(4)  Derigging.  Derigging is the reverse of the prepa-ration and rigging procedures in steps d (1) and d (2).7-7FM  10-450-4/MCRP 4-23E, VOL II/NWP 3-04.12/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL II/COMDTINST M13482.2RIGGING  STEPS   1. Position the apex  fitting on top of the launch standpedestal.  Route outer sling legs 1and 2 to the front of thelauncher  (lunette end).  Route inner sling legs 3 and 4 tothe rear of the load.  Sling legs 1 and 3 must  be on the leftside of the load.2. Route the chain end of sling leg 1 through the leftfront lifting provision located aft of the leveling cylinderoutboard end.  Place the correct link from Table 7-4 in thegrab hook.  Repeat with sling leg 2 on the right front liftprovision.  Ensure the chain is routed from the inside ofthe  lifting  provision  to  the  outside  so  the  hook  on  thegrab hook faces outboard when you insert the chain inthe  grab  hook.    Secure  the  excess  chain  with  Type  IIInylon cord.3. Route one end of the tubular nylon through the pot-ted eye of sling leg 1.  Route the same end of the tubularnylon through the potted eye of sling leg 2.  Position thepotted eyes of the two sling legs 39 inches apart so thesling legs cannot contact the two outer launch booms orthe center boom.  Using the remainder of the tubular ny-lon, repeat the procedure until there are at least 5 lengthsof nylon (2 1/2 wraps) between the potted eyes of the twosling legs.  Tie the ends of the tubular nylon together witha square knot and an overhand knot in each running end.NOTE:  Do not route the tubular nylon between the chainsor grab hooks.  Failure to attach the tubular nylon be-tween the sling leg potted eyes may result in damage tothe missile launch booms or failure of the load.4.   Route the chain end of sling leg 3 through the leftrear lift provision located above the taillight.  Place thecorrect link from Table 7-4 in the grab hook.  Repeat withsling  leg  4  on  the  right  rear  lift  provision.    Secure  theexcess chain with Type III nylon cord.5. Pull the sling legs up and tape or tie (breakaway tech-nique) the grab hooks to the boom supports.  Cluster andtape or tie (breakaway technique) all sling legs togetherabove the center launch boom to prevent entanglementduring hookup and lift-off.Figure 7-4.

Gather the excess netabove the load and tape the net together every 3 feet fromthe apex down (breakaway technique).2. Lay out the second 10,000-pound cargo net next tothe first one and center the two sleds on the net side-by-side facing opposite directions.  Close the net to the apexfitting of the cargo net.  Gather the excess net above theload and tape the net together every 3 feet from the apexdown (breakaway technique).3.   Attach the chain from the 10,000-pound sling leg tothe apex of the cargo net holding the sleds.  Insert link 4 inthe  grabhook.    The  end  of  the  sling  leg  with  the  apexattached  is  fed  under  the  net  holding  the  two  MOSTsalong the axis of the honeycomb.  It is passed through thenet at the center and pulled upward between the two sheetsof honeycomb and attached to the apex of the net usingthe apex.  This will allow the sleds to hang directly belowthe MOST.Figure 14-6.
