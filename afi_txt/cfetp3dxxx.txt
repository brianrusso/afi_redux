The changing Cyberspace and Air and Space Expeditionary Forces (AEF) environments require vision, preparation, and attention to ensure people have the right skills and tools to deliver the Cyberspace capabilities and the support required by the war fighter in meeting the Air Force mission of today and the vision of the future.  Declining resources, expanding diversity of mission, and ever-changing technologies in the Air Force are impacting the availability of our most valuable resource--people.  These factors will continue to exist in the future, making it essential for the workforce to be effectively and efficiently trained to perform duties within each skill level of an Air Force Specialty (AFS).  To meet the challenges of tomorrow, the Air Force must place a greater emphasis on career field training.  This Cyberspace Support Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive core training document that identifies life-cycle training/education requirements, support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the 3DXXX family of career field specialties.  The plan is a "training road map" for the career field.  It provides Airmen a clear career path to success and makes career field training identifiable, measurable, and budget defensible. 2.  The CFETP documents the career field training program and consists of two parts.  Management uses both parts in conjunction with the Training Business Area (TBA) to plan, manage and control training within the career field.  NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training 2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty family.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B: identifies general career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies and career field path; Section C: associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training and other); Section D: indicates resource constraints (e.g., funds, manpower, equipment, facilities); and Section E: identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. 2.2.  Part II includes the following: Section A: identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, Training References (TRs)  to support training, AETC-conducted training, wartime course and core task and correspondence course requirements.  Section B: contains the Course Objectives List (COL) and training standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements;  Section C: identifies available support materials (e.g.,  Qualification Training Package, which may be developed to support proficiency training); Section D: identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses; and Section E: identifies MAJCOM-unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  At unit level, supervisors and 4  trainers will use Part II to identify, plan and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. 3.  Use of the guidance provided in this CFETP provides the foundation for effective and efficient training for individuals in this career field at the appropriate points in their careers.  This plan enables the Air Force to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs. 5  Abbreviations/Terms Explained This section provides a common understanding of the terms that apply to the 3DXXX Career Field and Education Training Plan.

These tasks are only for those career fields that still need them applied to their schoolhouse tasks. Workflow.  A series of steps necessary for the initiation, tracking and delivery of services or outputs with the capability to cut across existing or future organizational boundaries.  Furthermore, web-based workflow products allow electronic coordination, staffing, and task management of documents and files.  They are relational to an electronic version of the Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) and other AF/DoD forms used for routing/collection of information.  Automation provides the capability to suspense and track correspondence through the workflow process and provides action officers and document originators status on their packages.  Provides users the capabilities to comply with structured electronic workflow processes and the flexibility to create/develop ad hoc workflow courses of actions.  Future use of standardized EIM tools will enhance usability and eliminate legacy methods.   15  Section A - General Information 1.  Purpose of the CFETP.  This CFETP provides the information necessary for AFCFMs, MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training those individuals in Cyberspace Support AFSCs should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their careers.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the AF or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  This training is provided by Air Education and Training Command (AETC) at various locations.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, Career Development Course (CDC) completion and correspondence courses required for award of the 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes, some of which are: 1.1.  Outlines foundational “common knowledge” that is shared by all Cyberspace Support career fields. This document is designed to supplement the AFSC-specific CFETPs. 1.2.  Serves as a management tool to plan, develop, manage, and conduct a career field training program.  Also, ensures that established training is provided at the appropriate point in an individual's career. 1.3.

Adequate training is essential to timely progression of personnel from apprentice to superintendent skill levels and plays an important role in the Air Force’s ability to accomplish its mission.  Everyone involved in training must do their part to plan, manage, and conduct effective training programs.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP and the 3DXXX Cyberspace Support Career Field Path table will ensure individuals receive viable training at appropriate points in their career.  Mandatory requirements for upgrade training to each skill level are covered in Section C.  6.  Training Decisions.  This CFETP was developed to encapsulate an entire spectrum of training requirements for the Cyberspace Support career field family, using a building block approach (simple to complex).  Included in this spectrum is the strategy of when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training. 6.1.  Proficiency Training.  This training is job qualification for an assigned duty position.  Additional qualification training becomes necessary when personnel transfer to another duty position, the unit mission changes, a new personnel program comes on board, or any time changes in techniques or procedures occur. 6.1.1.  The 81 TRSS/TSQ (Q-Flight) develops AFJQSs/AFQTPs to support tasks relating to Cyberspace Operations and Systems, functions, and duties.

Measurement.  Each objective is indicated as follows:  W indicates task or subject knowledge which is measured using a written test, PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a performance progress check, and PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a progress check. 5.  Standard.  The standard is 70% on written examinations.  Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. 6.  Proficiency Level.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step by step procedures for doing the task. Section C - Support Materials 7.
