(T-3) 1.3.10.5.  Each  instructor  aircrew  member  is  responsible  for  the  safe  execution  of  the duties of their respective crew position.  At any time during the flight, if the judgment or proficiency  of  the  student  should  raise  a  question  in  the  instructor’s  mind  as  to  the student’s  ability  to  safely  execute  the  duties  of  the  aircrew  position,  the  instructor  will immediately  take  over  these  duties.  (T-3)    The  instructor  should  then  explain  and demonstrate the proper method of executing these duties.   In order to provide effective instruction  concerning  weapons  system  employment,  instructors  must  be  thoroughly knowledgeable  in  AC-130  TTPs,  governing  AFIs,  regulatory  guidance,  and  other materials such as applicable manufacturer’s publications.  (T-0) 1.3.10.6.  Instructor  pilots  are  responsible  at  all  times  for  the  conduct  of  the  flight  and safety of the aircraft. (T-3)  At any time during the flight, if the judgment or proficiency of  the  student  at  the  controls  raises  a  question  in  the  instructor  pilot’s  mind  as  to  the student’s  ability  to  safely  complete  a  prescribed  maneuver,  the  instructor  pilot  will immediately take over the controls of the aircraft.  (T-3)  The instructor pilot should then explain and demonstrate proper methods of conducting the maneuver prior to the student resuming  control  of  the  aircraft.    Place  special  emphasis  on  the  procedures  for  positive identification  of  emergency  conditions  before  initiating  corrective  action.    (T-3)    In addition,  instructors  should  place  a  high  emphasis  on  the  procedures  for  positive exchange of control; thoroughly brief these procedures. 1.3.10.7.  Instructors who demonstrate deficiencies in their ability to instruct may be used in  their  primary  crew  position  (provided  the  deficiency  does  not  involve  primary  crew duties).    Commanders  will  take  the  necessary  action  to  either  retrain  or  remove  those individuals from instructor status IAW Air Force or MAJCOM directives.  (T-2) 1.3.10.8.

The primary training method for AC-130 initial qualification or upgrade training is attendance at an ETCA formal school. USAF policy dictates the use of formal schools  unless  attendance  is  impractical.  The  secondary  method  is  in-unit  training  using applicable  formal  school  courseware.  Accomplish  requalification  training  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol. 1. 1.4.1.  Secondary  Method  Training  (SMT).  Secondary  Method  Training  (SMT)  requires  a waiver  be  submitted  through  appropriate  channels  per  this  instruction  and  approved  by MAJCOM/A3T. Any aircrew member who was previously disenrolled from a formal ETCA course  for  substandard  performance  is  ineligible  for  Secondary  Method  Training.  Aircrew members  (primary  or  supervisory)  must  complete  SMT  within  180  calendar  days  from  the date  of  their  first  ground  training  session  or  first  flight,  whichever  occurs  first.    (T-2) Individuals will start training within 45 calendar days of waiver approval.  (T-2)  Individuals unable  to  complete  training  within  these  limits  may  continue  training;  however,  their  units will  notify  AFSOC/A3T  with  a  description  of  the  difficulty  and  expected  completion  date (not to exceed an additional 120 calendar days).  (T-2)  If SMT is not completed by this date, any  further  extension  requires  AFSOC/A3  approval.  Commanders  will  ensure  aircrew personnel  engaged  in  qualification  or  requalification  training  complete  their  training  in  a timely  and  uninterrupted  manner.    (T-3)    Duties  not  directly  related  to  qualification  or requalification  training  should  be  minimized.  Upon  completion  of  SMT  training,  units  will notify  AFSOC/A3T  using  the  SMT  Completion  Memo.    (T-2)  SMT  Waiver  and  SMT Completion the  AFSOC/A3TA  Sharepoint  website, https://eis.afsoc.af.mil/sites/A3/A3T/A3TA/default.aspx. templates  are  available  on 1.4.1.1.  Formal  School  courseware  requests.    19/551  SOS  are  the  primary  sources  for formal  training  products.  When  specific  formal  courseware  is  not  published,  use  of locally developed training syllabi is authorized. Units will forward all locally developed syllabi  for in-unit training to  AFSOC/A3T for review and approval.   (T-2)  All   locally approved in-unit syllabi are posted on the AFSOC/A3T web page. For SMT requests, the waiver  authority  (per  Table  1.1)  must  include  the  appropriate  formal  school  (19/551 SOS)  as  an  addressee  on  all  correspondence  and  will  request  that  the  formal  school forward  applicable  courseware  to  the  aircrew  member‘s  unit  of  assignment.    (T-2)  Courseware includes but is not limited to; the course syllabus, briefings, Computer Based Training  (CBT)  modules,  student  and  instructor  guides,  and  training  guides  and  grade sheets  for  the  student‘s  training  folder.  The  unit  training  office  will  verify  the  current version is used.  (Note: Formal schools should not forward written examinations as part of the courseware for in-unit qualification training). 1.4.1.2.  Complete  all  academic,  ground,  and  flight  training  outlined  in  the  courseware.  When  the  courseware  is  adapted  for  local  use,  modify  it  only  if  the  training  is incompatible with local training conditions (e.g. simulator not available).  Students may proficiency  advance  (PA)  provided  all  required  proficiency  levels  (RPLs)  are  met  or exceeded  for  the  advanced  (skipped)  sortie(s)/lesson(s).    The  SQ/DO  is  the  approval authority for proficiency advancement. 1.4.1.2.1.  Syllabus  Waivers.    A  syllabus  waiver  is  a  planned  one-time  exception  to the  syllabus  used  to  enhance  or  accommodate  student  training  in  special  or  unusual circumstances.    Syllabus  waivers  are  not  intended  to  be  permanent  changes  to  a syllabus,  but  should  be  suggested  as  syllabus  changes  if  a  permanent  change  is AFI11-2AC-130V1  19 JUNE 2015   13  warranted.    AFSOC/A3T  is  the  approval  authority  for  syllabus  waivers.  Submit syllabus  waiver  requests  in  writing,  including  the  rationale  for  the  waiver  using  a memorandum  for  record.  Route  all  waiver  requests  through  SOG/CC,  who  will forward to AFSOC/A3T.  (T-2) AFSOC/A3T will approve or disapprove requests and forward  a  copy  of  approved  waivers  to  SOG/CC  and  the  appropriate  gaining  unit training  office.  SOGs  will  maintain  a  record  of  all  approved  waivers  for  two  years.  (T-2) Obtain syllabus waiver approval prior to commencement of training. 1.4.1.2.2.  Syllabus Deviations.  A syllabus deviation is any unplanned variation from syllabus  or  equivalent  directed  requirement  such  as  prerequisite  flow,  turn  times, landing currency, minimum number of events, etc.  Accomplish all syllabus training unless  a  waiver  request  is  approved  prior  to  beginning  training.    If  unforeseen circumstances result in an omission of required training, the SQ/DO will determine if the omitted training can be accomplished later in the syllabus flow, without adversely affecting  the  quality  of  student  training.    (T-3)    Document  all  syllabus  deviations, SQ/DO directed corrective actions, and accomplishment of the omitted training in the student‘s training folder.  However, on a case-by-case basis the SQ/DO may authorize an  intentional  syllabus  deviation  in  the  interest  of  flying  safety.    All  syllabus deviations are documented and maintained in the student training folder.  (T-3) 1.4.1.3.  MAJCOM  approved  differences  training  may  be  conducted  in  unit  without  a waiver. 1.4.1.4.  Units conducting training where a waiver is not required (i.e., complete training for  restricted  AF  Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification,  MAJCOM  approved differences training) will send a request for any applicable courseware through channels to  MAJCOM/A3T,  with  an  information  copy  to  the  appropriate  formal  school.    (T-2) Include unit point of contact (name, rank, office symbol, and telephone number) and the name and rank of the individual receiving the training. 1.4.2.  Establish  and  maintain  aircrew  training  records  and  forms  per  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1 AFSOC Supplement requirements. 1.4.2.1.  Use the AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications, or AF Form 1381, USAF Certification  of  Air  Crew  Training,  to  document  ground/flying  training  associated  with mission  qualification,  and  to  document  instructor  certified  and  one-  time/initial  flying training  events.

The following forms aid management of aircrew training programs. 1.4.2.2.1.  AF  Form  4109,  SOF/CSAR  Aircrew  Training  Record,  is  used  as  the training  record  jacket  to  document  in-unit  qualification  or  upgrade  of  an  aircrew member.  It documents applicable ground training, special function training, part task training,  cockpit  procedures  training,  simulator  training,  and  flying  training accomplished by crewmembers. 1.4.2.2.2.  AF  Form  4110,  Comments  –SOF/CSAR  Training  Record,  is  used  to document narrative comments on aircrew training activities.   14  AFI11-2AC-130V1  19 JUNE 2015 1.4.2.2.3.  AF Form 4111, SOF/CSAR Training Record, is used to list RPL, indicate events for training sortie completion, and to document demonstrated student task and subtask  performance  and  knowledge  proficiency  levels.    Units  are  authorized  to overprint and reproduce  AF  Form  4111 for approved course syllabi.  The number of training  tasks  in  the  appropriate  training  guide  is  a  recommended  minimum,  which normally allows the student to achieve proficiency. It is neither intended to restrict the number of times the task is accomplished nor restrict proficiency advancement. 1.4.2.3.  IAW  the  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP),  personnel  in  Air Force  Specialty  Code  (AFSC)  1AXXX  are  exempt  from  maintaining  OJT  Training Folders (AF Form 623). 1.4.2.4.

Unless specifically directed, the unit commander determines the level  of  supervision  necessary  to  accomplish  required  training.    If  the  mission  objectives include  introduction  to  tasks  or  instruction  to  correct  previous  discrepancies,  then  an instructor  may  be  required.    The  following  personnel  must  be  supervised  by  an  instructor from a like crew position when performing aircrew duties. 1.4.4.1.  Non-current crewmembers. 1.4.4.2.  Crewmembers in initial, difference, upgrade, or requalification flying training. 1.4.4.3.  Senior  officers  who  have  not  completed  initial  qualification  as  outlined  in Chapter 2 and as outlined in Paragraph 1.7. 1.4.5.  Cross  Crew  Position  Training  (CCPT).  With  unit  commander,  operations  officer,  or mission  commander  approval,  instructors  from  one  crew  position  may  train  crewmembers from a different crew position on specific skills/events in which both are qualified (as long as the instructor is not performing duties as a primary crewmember at the time) unless otherwise restricted  in  this  volume.  Ensure  flight  evaluations  comply  with  requirements  of  AFI  11-2AC- 130, Vol. 2, Aircrew Evaluation Criteria. 1.5.  Service  Commitments.  Formal  training,  either  primary  or  secondary  method,  conducted per  this  instruction  may  incur  a  service  commitment  IAW  AFI  36-2107,  Active  Duty  Service Commitments  (ADSC).    Reference  the  appropriate  AFI  for  program  specifics.    Individuals  will acknowledge  the  incurred  SC  by  signing  the  appropriate  Active  Duty  Service  Commitment Acknowledgement  Statement,  prior  to  entering  training.    (T-1)    The  unit  training  officer  will notify  AFPC/DPSFO  via  the  servicing  Military  Personnel  Flight  (MPF)  once  training  is complete.  (T-1) 1.6.  Waivers.  AF/A35 is the waiver authority for training requirements specified in AFI 11202, Vol 1.  This  authority  has been delegated to MAJCOM/A3 for specific  aircrew training events (case  by  case  basis).    These  requirements  currently  include  initial  CRM  training,  initial  life AFI11-2AC-130V1  19 JUNE 2015   15  support equipment and procedures training, Survival Evasion Resistance Escape (SERE), flight evaluations, and egress training (see AFI 11-202, Vol 1 for specific guidance).

Units  requesting  waivers  for  SMT  in-unit  qualification,  mission  qualification,  or upgrade  of  an  aircrew  member  will  send  requests  through  appropriate  channels  to MAJCOM/A3T.    (T-2)    Formal  schools  should  forward  current  copies  of  courseware materials  to  units  semi-annually.  (T-2)    Maintain  copies  of  all  waivers  in  the  individual’s training  folder.    If  the  training  incurs  an  ADSC,  include  the  statement  “Individual acknowledged  receipt  of  ADSC  by  signing  the  AF  Form  63,  Active  Duty  Service Commitment Acknowledgement Statement, on <date AF Form 63 signed>”. 1.6.4.  Operations Group commander or equivalent (e.  g. CJSOAC/CC) may: 1.6.4.1.  Waive  10  percent  of  the  total  and  PAA  hours  required  for  upgrade  in  all  crew positions,  on  an  individual  basis  only.    File  a  copy  of  the  waiver  in  the  individual‘s training record.  Students attending formal school will bring a waiver letter to the formal school for insertion into their training record.  (T-3) 1.6.4.2.  Extend ground training requirement due dates up to 2 months for Note 1 items in the RTM ground training table on an individual basis only (Exception:  Items referenced in Paragraph 1.6 levied by other AFIs may not be waived by the OG unless specifically authorized to do so in the source AFI).  These events may count towards the next periodic requirements (units will note on waiver when events were accomplished and the ARMS due date should be updated).  See MDS specific RTM for further guidance.  (T-3) 1.6.4.3.  Extend  due  dates  for  the  duration  of  an  exercise,  contingency  or  operational mission  for  RTM  ground  training  table  events  on  an  individual  basis  only  if  a crewmember  goes  overdue  while  away  from  home  station  and  the  training  is  not available at the deployed location (Exception:  Items referenced in Paragraph 1.6 levied by other AFIs may not be waived by the OG unless specifically authorized to do so in the source AFI).  See MDS specific RTM for further guidance.  (T-3) 1.6.4.4.  Waive  all  flying  training  requirements  (RTM  BAQ  and  MR  tables  except  as otherwise noted) on an individual basis only.  Wings/groups must keep an accurate record of waivers granted.  (T-2)  Notify MAJCOM/A3T when waivers are issued. 1.6.5.  Unit commanders may carry new crewmembers as “mission ready” (MR) for up to six months if an aircrew member arrives at the unit after a PCS or formal school and is not MR in all core mission events.  Units must notify MAJCOM/A3T of any OG extensions.  (T-2)  Under no circumstance should aircrew perform events in which they are not qualified unless under  the  direct  supervision  of  an  instructor.    This  policy  does  not  apply  to  basic  aircraft qualification events.  If training is not complete in six months, the aircrew member becomes “non-mission  ready”  (NMR).    Squadrons  will  have  six  months  from  the  time  a  new  core mission event is added and MAJCOM guidance issued to train and qualify aircrew in the new event.  (T-2) 1.7.  Senior Officer Flying/Supervisory Aircrew.  See AFI 11-202, Vol 1, AFSOC SUP. 1.8.  Intra-command and Inter-command Transfer of Aircrews.  For intra-command transfer of aircrew members, the gaining organization will honor validated training completed by newly assigned  crewmembers  prior  to  the  transfer.    (T-2)    For  inter-command  transfer,  certifications AFI11-2AC-130V1  19 JUNE 2015   17  and qualifications should be  accepted to the maximum  extent practical,  as long as training  and evaluation standards are equivalent.  The operations officer at the gaining unit should review the individual's  career  training  folder  and  flight  evaluation  folder  to  determine  which  certifications and qualifications will be honored.  Aircrew members qualified in the same MDS are considered qualified in that equipment throughout the force when used for the same mission.  (T-2) 1.8.1.  Permanent  Change  of  Station  (PCS)  Screening.    Losing  units  will  screen  individual flight  and  ground  training  records  during  unit  out-processing.    (T-2)    Accomplish  this screening in sufficient time to correct discrepancies prior to PCS.  Losing unit will provide a printed  copy  of  current  ground  and  flying  training  summaries  to  individuals  prior  to  PCS.  (T-3)  See AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, for additional guidance. 1.8.2.  Instructor training and qualifications may be accepted at the discretion of the gaining unit commander. 1.9.  Initial  Cadre  for  Change  of  Aircraft,  Equipment,  or  Capability.  When  possible, qualified personnel  in  other units operating like  equipment  should provide the initial  cadre.   In some instances, it is necessary for units converting from one design aircraft to another to form an initial  cadre  of  aircrew  personnel  for  whom  certain  training  qualification  requirements  may  be waived.    The  conversion  program  action  directive  should  contain  authorization  to  form  initial cadre crews.   Unless  otherwise stated in  the program  action directive, the following  conditions apply to management of initial cadre aircrew qualification for aircraft conversion: 1.9.1.  From  a  nucleus  of  instructor  and  flight  examiner  personnel  (initial  cadre)  will  be formed  to  begin  aircrew  training.    Do  not  designate  initial  cadre  in  a  crew  position  higher than currently held; for example, AC-130U IP to AC-130J flight examiner. 1.9.2.  Initial  cadre  is  not  required  for  minor  aircraft  modifications  when  any  required training for that modification is provided by the contractor and/or can easily be accomplished in-unit. Conduct differences training for the new equipment and log training on a letter of Xs or Memo for Record (MFR).  Crewmembers will not fly with new equipment until trained.  (T-2) 1.10.  Unit  Aircrew  Capability.  Squadrons  will  maintain  mission  ready  status  on  all  primary aircrew members up to unit authorizations (N/A for USAFWS instructor aircrew members).  (T-3.  Commanders will train aircrews to meet capabilities specified in unit DOC statements.  (T-3)  Supervisory  aircrew  and  staff  members  assigned  above  squadron  level,  which  are  in  excess  of the unit’s mission requirements, should maintain mission ready, basic mission capable or basic aircraft  qualification  status,  as  necessary.    Note:    To  change  from  BMC  to  MR  status,  a crewmember will begin maintaining full MR flying currency.  (T-2)  The unit commander may assign additional training, as desired. 1.10.1.  Commanders will not assign additional duties to first assignment “pipeline” (directly out  of formal MDS training)  crewmembers  (officer and  enlisted) for their first  6 months in the unit.  (T-2)  First assignment crewmembers in any AFSOC weapon system should not be given  an  additional  duty  for  the  first  6  months  in  the  unit.    This  policy  allows  pipeline students  to  learn  the  weapon  system  without  distraction  of  an  additional  duty;  all  other personnel may be assigned additional duties. 1.10.2.  Aircrew members will not perform long term duties which detract from the primary duties of training for, or performing the unit flying mission.  (T-2)   18  AFI11-2AC-130V1  19 JUNE 2015 1.10.3.  ACC  Currency  Requirements.    Permanent  Party  aircrew  assigned  to  the  14  WPS USAFWS  instructors  must  maintain  at  least  basic  mission  capable  flying  currency  in  the portions of the mission they instruct.  (T-3)  Unit commanders may direct specific individuals to  maintain  only  partial  BMC  qualifications.    In  such  cases,  the  crewmember  will  require only  those  currency  items  associated  with  this  tailored  qualification.    The  individual’s  AF Form 8 should indicate applicable restrictions based on assignments of less than full mission qualification.  If 14 WPS crewmembers augment operational units, provide the gaining unit commander a detailed list  of the individual’s current  training status.   The individual should comply  with  MR  training  requirements  of  the  gaining  unit  or  pursue  applicable  waivers through  the  operational  unit’s  MAJCOM/A3.    The  gaining  unit  or  MAJCOM  may  levy additional requirements as desired.  Chapter  4 outlines exceptions to continuation currency training  requirements  for  these  personnel.    Note:    For  the  purposes  of  this  instruction, enlisted aircrew members assigned to the 14 WPS are not considered USAFWS instructors.  (T-3) training 1.11.  RAP  Tasking  Memorandum requirements  for  subordinate  units.    Due  to  dynamic  requirements  of  Combatant  Commanders, training  requirements  and  currencies  may  be  altered  regularly.

This  chapter  outlines for  Basic  Aircraft Qualification  (BAQ)  training  which  may  be  completed  via  initial  qualification,  requalification, conversion, or differences training.  Duties not directly related to qualification or requalification training should be minimized. the  minimum requirements 2.1.1.  Qualification training provides the training necessary to initially qualify crewmembers in  a  basic  crew  position  and  flying  duties  without  regard  to  the  unit’s  mission.    Upon completion  of  qualification  training,  the  crewmember  attains  BAQ  status.    BAQ  is  a prerequisite for Mission Qualification Training (MQT, outlined in Chapter 3). 2.2.  General  Requirements.  The  primary  method  of  initial  qualification  and  requalification training is the appropriate formal training course listed in the ETCA.  If no requalification course exists, conduct requalification using the initial qualification course.  Completing the appropriate formal  course  satisfies  the  training  requirements  of  this  chapter.    When  attendance  is  not practical  or  quotas  are  not  available,  units  may  request  secondary  method  in-unit  qualification training  waivers  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1,  AFSOC  SUP.    Do  not  issue  a  secondary  method training  waiver  to  any  aircrew  member  who  has  previously  failed  to  successfully  complete  the ETCA formal course due to substandard performance. 2.3.  Training  Prerequisites.  Course  prerequisites  are  IAW  the  appropriate  formal  course syllabus,  the  ETCA,  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1  and  this  instruction.    The  formal  school  Syllabus  of Instruction (SOI) designates the course prerequisite approval authority. 2.4.  Ground  Training  Requirements.  All  crewmembers  must  complete  ground  training requirements IAW Table 2.1, prior to the first flight (T-2).  See chapter 4 for event descriptions. Table 2.1.  Basic Aircraft Qualification Ground Training Requirements  (T-1).

Written  Examination.    Ensure  open  and  closed  book  qualification  examinations  are completed before the end of basic qualification flying training.  Ensure written examinations satisfy the requirements of AFI 11-202, Vol. 2 and MDS Vol. 2.  The formal school will not forward their examinations as part of the courseware for in unit qualifications.  (T-2)  When   20  AFI11-2AC-130V1  19 JUNE 2015 qualification  training  is  completed  by  secondary  method,  the  student  will  complete  the appropriate group stan/eval or equivalent examination IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 2, para 5.2.7. 2.4.2.  Emergency  Egress  Training,  Non-Ejection  [LL03].    All  crewmembers  and  other personnel  regularly  flying  on  AFSOC  aircraft  will  receive  hands-on  egress  training  in  the aircraft  prior  to  their  first  flight.    (T-2)    Aircrew  members  must  be  given  flight  deck  and cargo compartment familiarization.  (T-2)  Place emphasis on the location and function of all switches  and  controls  required  for  all  emergency  procedures.    See  current  AC-130  Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memo (RTM) for further details. 2.5.  Flying  Training  Requirements.  Satisfactorily  completing  the  appropriate  ETCA  formal course  satisfies  the  requirements  of  this  section.    Accomplish  approved  in-unit  qualification training IAW applicable formal school courseware and the guidance below: 2.5.1.  Flying  training  lessons  should  be  completed  sequentially.    If  mission  scheduling  or student  progress  dictates  otherwise,  in-unit  training  sequences  may  be  changed  by  the  unit Operations Officer. 2.5.2.  AFSOC  policy  for  C-130  pilot  training  requires  that,  prior  to  certification,  ACs  and IPs  train to a 3C level in simulated 3-engine takeoffs and simulated 2-engine approaches and landings.  CPs will see a demonstration of a simulated 3-engine takeoff and a demonstration of  a  simulated  2-engine  approach  and  landing  prior  to  flying  without  an  instructor.    These events may be accomplished in a simulator to satisfy this requirement.  (T-1) 2.6.  Basic  Aircraft  Qualification  Conversion/Differences  Training.  Conversion  training  is normally  associated  with  training  between  MDS  (e.g.  C-21  to  C-130).    Difference  training  is conducted when training in a different series aircraft in the same mission design (e.g. C-130E to C-130H3).  Use difference training when changing between same design aircraft and the amount of training needed for qualification does not warrant attendance at a formal qualification course.  Additionally,  accomplish  difference  training  when  an  aircraft  is  modified  and  any  required training  for  that  modification  can  easily  be  accomplished  in-unit.  BAQ  difference  training qualifies an aircrew member to be a basic crewmember.  Primary method for differences training is via completion of a formal school transition course (TX).  If a TX course is not available, the alternate  method  is  via  in  unit  ground  and  flight  training  IAW  MAJCOM/A3T  approved  AF Form  4111,  satisfactory  completion  of  the  qualification  written  open/closed  examinations,  and instructor  certification  on  the  AF  Form  4348  or  AF  Form  1381  for  the  new  aircraft.    Aircrew members entered into differences training will complete training within 180 days after the first flight of the training program.  BAQ Differences training is authorized per Table 2.2. 2.6.1.  For  basic  aircraft  instrument/qualification  purposes  the  AC-130U,  C-130E/H,  C-130H1/2,  C-130H3,  EC-130E/H,  HC-130P/N,  MC-130H,  MC-130P,  and  MC-130W  are generally considered to  be different series aircraft in the same MDS.  Training between the C-130J variants and any other C-130 variant is conversion training and will be accomplished via a formal course at an FTU or via SMT.  (T-2) 2.6.2.  For purposes of Paragraph  2.6 and Table 2.2, C-130 ‘slick’ variants are C-130E/H, C130H1/2, C-130H3, and demodified EC-130E/H; difference training and AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381 entries are necessary for each variant. 2.6.3.  Upon  completion  of  differences  training  and  certification  on  the  AF  Form  4348  or AF Form  1381,  the  crewmember  is  Basic  Aircraft  Qualified  (BAQ)  in  the  new  aircraft.  AFI11-2AC-130V1  19 JUNE 2015   21  Aircrew  members  may  maintain  previous  C-130  instructor/evaluator,  air  to  air  refueling (AAR)  and  Maximum  Effort  qualifications  at  the  discretion  of  the  unit  commander.    Other crew  position  qualifications  (i.e.  mission  instructor)  are  attained  through  the  procedures  in Chapter 5. 2.6.4.  Aircrew  members  training  to  an  MDS  not  specifically  listed  in  Paragraph  2.6,  or Table 2.2,  must  complete  conversion  training.  (T-2)    Conversion  training  requires  the completion of the formal school initial qualification course. 2.6.5.  Multiple Qualification.  Crewmembers will attend a formal initial qualification or TX course  to  gain  basic  aircraft  qualification  in  another  MDS  unless  authorized  difference training  per  Paragraph  2.6.    (T-2)    For  approved  secondary  method  training,  request courseware IAW Paragraph 1.4. 2.7.  C-130E/H  Qualification  Training.  All  aircrew  members  in  flying  billets  will  maintain qualification  in  the  AC-130U.    (T-2)    Aircrew  members  will  not  be  solely  qualified  in  the  C-130E/H. (T-2)  Students awaiting AC-130U qualification training at the 19 SOS are authorized to fly the C-130E/H providing they are qualified and current (if non-current, under the supervision of an instructor).  All C-130E/H qualified aircrew members will comply with applicable ground training  requirements  in  the RTM ground training table and flying training  requirements  in the RTM BAQ table.

Overview.  This  chapter  establishes  the  minimum  training  requirements  for  completing mission qualification and requalification.  Aircrew members completing mission qualification or requalification  will  meet  the  requirements  of  this  chapter.    (T-2)    Upon  completion  of  mission qualification training, assign the crewmember either Basic Mission Capable (BMC) or Mission Ready (MR) status. 3.2.  General  Requirements.  The  primary  method  of  mission  qualification  is  to  complete  the appropriate formal training course listed in the ETCA.  Completing the appropriate formal course satisfies the training requirements of this chapter.  Accomplish requalification training IAW AFI 11-202,  Vol  1.    If  required  and  no  formal  requalification  course  exists,  conduct  requalification using the initial mission qualification course.  When attendance is not practical or quotas are not available, units may request waivers to conduct secondary method mission qualification training IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1,  AFSOC  SUP  using  formal  school  courseware.    Do  not  issue  aircrew members  who  have  previously  failed  to  complete  an  ETCA  formal  course  for  substandard performance an SMT waiver for the same training.  The secondary method requires use of formal school  courseware  and  a  waiver  from  the  appropriate  waiver  authority.    This  courseware establishes the minimum training requirements to meet standards specified in AFI 11-2AC-130, Vol  2.    Units  may  supplement  courseware  to  meet  local  requirements.    Submit  all  courseware change requests to HQ AFSOC/A3T prior to implementation. 3.2.1.  Direct  Support  Operator  (DSO)  Training.  DSOs  will  complete  appropriate qualification/requalification  course  utilizing  AFSOC/AFSOTC  approved  syllabi  and courseware.    (T-2)    After  completing  initial  mission  qualification  training  and  evaluation, AFSOC differences/conversion training may be used to attain qualification in different series of AFSOC C-130 MDS and vertical lift aircraft. In all instances use AFSOC/A3T approved courseware. 3.2.2.  DSOs are tasked to fly on all AFSOC aircraft and will maintain universal qualification per AFI 11-202, Vol. 2, AFSOC Supplement.  (T-2)  They will comply with AFI 11-2MDS, Vol. 1, DSO semi-annual ground and flying training currency requirements for each aircraft in  which a qualification is  held.  (T-2)  DSOs will log a minimum of one CMP each semi-annual  period  per  AC-130/MC-130/CV-22  regardless  of  FTL.    (T-2)    Half  the  FTL requirements  for  each  MDS  for  DSOs  who  maintain  both  a  C-130  and  vertical-lift qualification. 3.3.  Training  Prerequisites.  Course  prerequisites  are  IAW  the  appropriate  formal  course syllabus,  the  ETCA,  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1,  and  this  instruction.    The  formal  school  syllabus designates the course prerequisite approval authority. 3.3.1.  This  does  not  preclude  simultaneous  basic  qualification  and  mission  qualification training.  Do not accomplish simultaneous/concurrent Multiple-MDS qualification upgrades. 3.3.2.  If there is not a separate mission requalification course, aircrew members requalifying in  the  units  mission  will  comply  with  the  initial  mission  qualification  course  prerequisites.

If  mission  scheduling  or student  progress  dictates  otherwise,  in-unit  training  sequences  may  be  changed  by  the  unit operations officer. 3.5.2.  There  should  be  minimum  time  lapse  between  training  missions,  and  every  effort should be made to complete mission qualification training requirements within the prescribed time period. 3.5.3.  Crewmember  requirements  may  be  completed  on  training  or  operational  missions under the supervision of an instructor in the same aircrew position.  Comply with restrictions in AFI 11-2AC-130, Vol 3. 3.6.  Specific  Mission  Training  Requirements.  AC-130  navigators  and  fire  control  officers (FCO)  will  have  300  hours  AC-130U  time  prior  to  entering  dual  navigator/  FCO  mission qualification training.  (T-2) 3.7.  Mission Difference Training Requirements.  When mission ready (MR) or basic mission capable  (BMC)  crewmembers  complete  differences  qualification  training  to  a  unit  assigned aircraft to be used in their current mission, or to a C-130 having the same mission they may be considered MR or BMC in the new aircraft.  If the new aircraft or unit has a different mission or aircraft  differences  warrant  additional  mission  qualification  training  is  required.    The  primary method for accomplishing this training is to attend the formal school transition course (TX).  If a formal school course does not exist and is authorized below, crewmembers may accomplish this training  in-unit  by  completing  MAJCOM/A3T  approved  AF  Form  4111,  mission  open/closed book examinations, and a flight evaluation. 3.7.1.  Crewmembers  qualified  and  current  in  special  mission  events  may  maintain  that qualification, once they are mission qualified in their new aircraft. AFI11-2AC-130V1  19 JUNE 2015   25  3.7.2.  Crewmembers  will  complete  all  required  ground  training  prior  to  being  declared mission ready.  (T-2) 3.7.3.  The  only  crew  positions  authorized  for  in-unit  difference  training  for  mission qualification  are  loadmasters,  aerial  gunners,  flight  engineers,  and  sensor  operators.  Accomplish  in-unit  difference  training  for  aircrew  members  by  completing  the  AF  Form 4111  for  difference  training  and  satisfactorily  completing  the  unit  written  mission qualification examination for the appropriate crew position. 3.7.3.1.  Loadmaster  Difference  Training.    In-unit  difference  training  is  authorized between all series of AC-130 aircraft using applicable approved courseware. 3.7.3.2.  Aerial  Gunner  Difference  Training.    In-unit  difference  training  is  between  all series of AC-130 aircraft using applicable approved courseware. 3.7.3.3.  Direct  Support  Operators  Difference  Training.    After  completing  mission qualification  training  and  a  flight  evaluation  on  any  AFSOC  AC/MC-130,  mission qualification  on  AC-130s  are  authorized  through  in-unit  difference  training.    Certify crewmembers using the AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381. 3.7.3.4.  Flight  Engineer  Difference  Training.

In-unit  difference  training  is  authorized between all series of AC-130 aircraft using applicable approved courseware.   26  AFI11-2AC-130V1  19 JUNE 2015 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General Requirements. 4.1.1.  Requirements in this chapter satisfy the minimum flying and related ground training to maintain currency.  Individual proficiency may require a greater number of events.  Failure to accomplish these continuation training requirements does not  affect  BMC or MR status but may  entail  additional  training  as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC.    If  any  sortie  or  event  in  this chapter is  included in  the RTM, it becomes a  requirement for  BAQ, BMC, and MR status.  The RTM contains all ground training and flying requirements tables and definitions. 4.1.2.  Training  requirements  may  be  completed  on  any  sortie  if  the  accrediting  criteria  of this instruction are met.  Sorties and events that are compatible may be credited on the same flight. 4.1.3.  Aircrew  members  cannot  log  continuation  training  requirements  in  events  in  which they are unqualified. 4.1.4.  Training  events  accomplished  on  an  evaluation  or  an  instructor  certification  (that event) may be credited toward the individual’s volume requirements. 4.1.5.  Flying  training  events  accomplished  during  formal  training  should  use  the  course completion  date  (successful  evaluation  date)  to  establish  the  due  dates  for  all  subsequent currency and requirements.  Use actual dates for ground training.  Certification events trained to a 3C in the FTU should use the date of the check-ride as the initial accomplishment date. 4.1.6.  Aircraft flying training requirements may be accomplished in an ATD as noted in the RTM BAQ and MR flying requirements tables. 4.2.  Training  Levels  (TL).  The  use  of  experienced  based  FTLs  and  Ground  Training  Levels (GTLs)  allows  the  squadron  commander  to  prioritize  training  resources.    Aircrew  members should  meet  the  minimum  criteria  established  in  Paragraph  4.2.1,  and  Table  4.1,  before assignment  to  the  respective  training  level.    FTLs  are  not  tied  to  flight  hours  for  AFRC/ANG.  When these minimums are met, awarding a training level is at the sole discretion of the squadron commander.  Note:  The aircrew member’s availability to fly should not be a factor in assigning a TL. 4.2.1.  FTLs are based on minimum primary aircraft assigned (PAA) time (total C-130 time for  DSOs)  and  total  time  per  Table  4.1.    For  basic  qualification  FTL,  PAA  time  should include  flight  and  sim  time  in  any  variant  of  C-130.    For  mission  qualification  FTL,  PAA time should include any type C-130 time and any AC-130 WST time. 4.2.1.1.  FTL “A”-Highly experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members. 4.2.1.2.  FTL “B”-Experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members. 4.2.1.3.  FTL “C”-Inexperienced BAQ and MR aircrew members (All Copilots). Table 4.1.  Minimum FTL Hour Requirements  (T-2).

Crewmembers  may  be  assigned  different  FTLs  for  basic  and  mission  qualifications and individual events.  For example, an aircraft commander coming from EC-130s might be assigned basic FTL “A”, mission FTL “C” with a caveat of FTL “A” for AAR. 4.2.3.  Change of FTL.  Once a semiannual  period begins,  do not  move personnel  to  a level requiring fewer events until the next semiannual period.  (T-3) 4.2.4.  GTLs are based upon operational flying experience. 4.2.4.1.  GTL “1”––Aircrew members with 5 years or greater of operational flying. 4.2.4.2.  GTL “2”––Aircrew members with less than 5 years of operational flying. 4.3.  Proration  of  Training  Requirements.  See  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1,  AFSOC  SUP.    Prorate aircrew  member  flying  training  requirements  for  individuals  following  completion  of  basic qualification,  mission  qualification,  requalification,  and  upgrades  to  a  new  special  mission qualification,  or  who  are  not  available  for  flying  duties  due  to  PCS,  non-flying  TDY,  DNIF, emergency leave, or other unavoidable circumstances which prevent the individual from flying.  Only prorate to zero requirements (No Requirements) for the period of 166 days to 6 months in cases of qualification, requalification, or upgrade.  Aircrew members who enter training after the start  of  the  training  period  may  be  prorated.    Prorate  individual  requirements  based  on  the number  of  full  calendar  months  left  in  the  training  period.

Re-currency  and  Requalification  Training.  Training  is  required  whenever  an  aircrew member does not meet a currency requirement in this instruction.  An aircrew member will not perform events unsupervised until training is accomplished.  (T-2) 4.4.1.  Loss of Currency.  Failure to accomplish events listed in RTM training tables results in  a  loss  of  currency  for  that  event.    Crewmembers  are  non-current  the  day  after  event currency expires. 4.4.1.1.  Loss  of  currency  in  any  RTM  BAQ  table  event  results  in  loss  of  basic  aircraft currency.    These  individuals  should  fly  under  the  supervision  of  an  instructor  or  flight examiner  on  all  sorties  until  recurrent.    (Exceptions:    FPs  that  lose  left  seat  landing currency may fly in the right seat without an instructor). 4.4.1.1.1.  Crewmembers who maintain qualification in their primary aircraft and a C-130  variant  may  satisfy  RTM  BAQ  table  currency  requirements  in  either  their primary  aircraft  or  the  C-130.    If  basic  semiannual  currency  is  lost  (failure  to complete the requirements of RTM BAQ table), it is lost for both aircraft.  Lost basic semiannual  currency  may  be  regained  in  either  aircraft.    Crewmembers  must complete  at  least  one  aircrew  proficiency  sortie  in  the  C-130  semiannually.  (T-2)  Failure to complete at least one aircrew proficiency sortie in the C-130 results in lost currency in the C-130 only and currency should be regained in the C-130.  (T-2) 4.4.1.2.  Loss of currency exceeding 6-months.  Crewmembers non-current in designated BAQ events (RTM BAQ table, note 1 events) in excess of six months results in loss of BAQ.  Crewmembers non-current in designated mission events (RTM MR table, note 1 events) in excess of six months results in loss of mission qualification. 4.4.2.  Regaining Currency. 4.4.2.1.  Only  RTM  BAQ  and  MR  tables,  note  1  events  require  an  evaluation (unqualified) if loss of currency exceeds 6 months (see AFI 11-202, Vol 1). Other events require  showing  proficiency  to  an  instructor  in  the  aircraft  or  simulator  to  regain currency.  If loss of currency exceeds 24 months in non-note 1 events, additional training will  consist  of  ground  and  flight  training  unit  commander  direction  (ensure  a  training folder is opened).  A FE may regain currency for NVG landings under the supervision of an  NVG  landing  qualified  IP  as  long  as  that  IP  is  not  performing  any  other  instructor duties at the time. AFI11-2AC-130V1  19 JUNE 2015   29  4.4.2.2.  Aircrew  non-current  in  special  mission  events  which  only  require  an  instructor certification (Table 5.3) may regain currency by showing proficiency in that event to an instructor. 4.4.3.  Requalification  Training.    Crewmembers  requiring  requalification  will  accomplish training IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1, applicable MAJCOM supplements, and Chapters 2, 3, and 5, of this instruction. 4.5.  Ground  Training.  Accomplish  ground  training  IAW  the  RTM  ground  training  table.  Crew members should comply with the time periods listed for their FTL/GTL.  Conduct training IAW  the  referenced  publications,  notes  in  RTM ground  training  table  and  the  guidance  below.  The governing directive or RTM takes precedence over Chapter 4 requirements.  If the AFI 11-2AC-130, Vol 1, is also listed as a governing directive, the most restrictive guidance should be followed. 4.5.1.  Failure  to  Complete  Ground  Training  Events.   Make-up  training  should  be accomplished  at  the  earliest  opportunity.    The  following  apply  when  crewmembers  exceed due dates for events in the RTM ground training table. 4.5.1.1.  Grounding  items.    Crewmembers  will  not  perform  flight  duties  until  the grounding item is satisfied.  (T-2) 4.5.1.2.  Training status items.  Crewmembers will not fly without instructor supervision.  (T-2) 4.5.1.3.  Mission  Ready  (MR)  items.    Failure  to  accomplish  MR  events  in  the  RTM ground training table results in non-mission ready status and the individual cannot deploy as a crewmember. 4.5.2.  Ancillary  training.    This  volume  is  not  a  comprehensive  list  of  all  ancillary  training required by the DOD.    Ancillary training parent instructions take precedence over this AFI for those training items. 4.5.3.  Ground  Training  Events.    See  current  AC-130  Ready  Aircrew  Program  Tasking Memo (RTM) for Ground Training Event definitions and requirements. 4.6.  Flying Training. 4.6.1.  All  aircrew  members  who  maintain  BAQ,  MR,  or  BMC  must  accomplish  all applicable  training  requirements  of  RTM  BAQ  table,  based  on  assigned  FTL  (A,  B,  or  C).  (T-2)  MR and BMC aircrew will also comply with the following: 4.6.1.1.  MR  aircrew  members  will  also  accomplish  applicable  mission  ready requirements from RTM MR table according to their mission qualification and FTL.  (T-2) 4.6.1.2.  BMC aircrew members will also accomplish at least 50 percent of the applicable mission requirements from RTM MR table according to their assigned FTL.  (T-2) 4.6.1.3.  BAQ  ACs  and  FPs  maintaining  MR  CP  status  will  maintain  left  seat  aircraft currency  IAW  RTM  BAQ  table  and  right  seat  mission  currency  IAW  RTM  MR  table.  (T-2)   30  AFI11-2AC-130V1  19 JUNE 2015 4.6.1.4.  MP qualified PQPs awaiting AC certification may complete Basic Qualification events  (RTM  BAQ  table)  in  either  seat.    Emphasis  should  be  on  left  seat  flying.    Fly Local  Proficiency  Sorties  from  the  left  seat.    PQPs  may  fly  in  the  left  seat  for  airland missions  when  an  aircraft  commander  who  has  a  minimum  of  100  hours  since certification occupies the right seat.  Mission events may be completed while performing copilot  duties  in  the  right  seat  or  in  the  left  seat  when  an  aircraft  commander  with  100 hours since certification occupies the right seat.  AFI 11-2AC-130, Vol 3, further defines takeoff and landing policy.  (T-1) 4.6.1.5.  MPD pilots may maintain left seat qualification at the discretion of the squadron commander. 4.6.1.6.  Instructors  and  flight  examiners  may  not  log  events  performed  by  other crewmembers during instruction or evaluations. 4.6.2.  Flying Training Events.  See current AC-130 Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memo (RTM) for Flying Training Event definitions and requirements. 4.7.  Multiple Qualifications.  See AFI 11-202, Vol 1, AFSOC SUP. 4.8.  Chemical Defense Task Qualification Training (CDTQT).  The purpose of CDTQT is to reinforce the crewmember's awareness of limitations and demonstrate physiological effects while wearing the aircrew chemical defense ensemble (ACDE).  The complications of heat exhaustion, fatigue, hyperventilation, limited dexterity, and hampered communication can all be experienced during  CDTQT.    All  aircrew  members  must  complete  initial  aircrew  life  support  chemical defense  training  prior  to  accomplishing  initial  CDTQT.    (T-2)    Complete  initial  disaster preparedness training for the ground ensemble prior to CDTQT if the ground ensemble is used.  Initial  CDTQT  should  be  done  in  the  aircraft  and  also  done  in  the  aircraft  at  least  every  four years.    If  initial  CDTQT  is  done  in  the  simulator,  log  the  next  event  in  the  aircraft.    All  other times the event may be accomplished in the simulator.  Accomplishing the event in the aircraft dual logs normal CDTQT. 4.8.1.  CDTQT Procedures. 4.8.1.1.  Accomplish  CDTQT  in-flight  using  the  primary  unit  aircraft.    Crewmembers will perform primary crew duties while wearing the ACDE.  (T-2)  All in-flight profiles must be a minimum of 1 hour and accomplished on training missions only.  Accomplish CDTQT in the simulator using primary unit aircraft WSTs.  Ensure all simulator profiles are  a  minimum  of  2  hours  and  flown  on  full  tactical  simulation  profiles.    This  should include a threat scenario and aircraft emergencies.  Flying the simulator profile with the entire crew wearing ACDE is highly encouraged. 4.8.1.2.  The  entire  ACDE  need  not  be  used.    Normally,  wear  the  filter  pack,  cotton gloves, butyl rubber gloves, Nomex gloves, and the protective hood, along with the CBO mask/AERPS and helmet (if applicable).  Either the ACDE or ground ensemble may be worn during aircraft preflight.  Ground ensembles should come from training assets. 4.8.1.3.  When  wearing  the  CBO  mask,  do  not  accomplish  CDTQT  when  required  to wear NVGs.  When wearing AERPS, ensure NVG events are accomplished. 4.8.1.4.  Ensure  an  observer  monitors  each  crewmember  while  accomplishing  CDTQT in-flight.  An instructor or flight examiner in each respective crew position, not wearing AFI11-2AC-130V1  19 JUNE 2015   31  the  chemical  defense  components,  will  act  as  the  observer  for  initial  CDTQT.    (T-2)  Exception:  An  IP  not  wearing  the  ensemble  and  not  performing  any  other  instructor duties  may  act  as  the  observer  for  initial  FE  training.    During  recurring  CDTQT,  if  the crewmember  can  be  directly  observed  by  another  primary  crewmember,  a  dedicated observer is not required.  The dedicated observer during recurring CDTQT may also wear AERPS for all crew positions except pilots (two non-pilot crewmembers wearing AERPS may observe one another).  Additionally, for safety purposes, ensure one crewmember in the back of the aircraft is not wearing AERPS in case of smoke and fumes.  (T-2) 4.8.1.4.1.  An  instructor  or  flight  examiner  pilot  not  wearing  the  chemical  defense components will occupy the opposite seat during initial pilot CDTQT.  (T-2)  During recurring  CDTQT,  a  mission  qualified  pilot  not  wearing  the  chemical  defense components  will  act  as  the  observer  and  occupy  the  opposite  seat.    With  squadron commander  approval,  both  pilots  may  wear  AERPS  while  occupying  the  pilot  seats provided  both  pilots  have  accomplished  CDTQT  within  the  past  90  days.    The squadron commander may delegate this authority to the operations officer or mission commander.  (T-2) 4.8.1.4.2.  Observers  should  closely  monitor  crewmembers  actions  during  CDTQT.  If a crewmember experiences difficulties such as excessive thermal stress, headaches, hyperventilation,  nausea,  etc.,  the  crewmember  should  remove  the  ensemble.    The observer should notify the AC of any difficulties encountered. 4.8.2.  Mission  profile.    Crewmembers  will  accomplish  CDTQT  during  a  normal  mission profile that includes mission crew duties (CAS, live fire, dry fire, air refueling, etc.).  (T-2)  In addition: 4.8.2.1.  Pilots  will  accomplish  a  minimum  of  one  approach  and  landing.    (T-2)    Pilots may accomplish CDTQT in either seat.   32  AFI11-2AC-130V1  19 JUNE 2015 Chapter 5 UPGRADE/SPECIALIZED TRAINING 5.1.  General.

Aircraft designated as BAI assets do not receive funding or manning consideration for the unit. Basic  Aircraft  Qualification  Aircrew  Member—An  aircrew  member  who  has  satisfactorily completed  qualification  training  in  the  basic  aircrew  position  and  maintains  aircraft  currency IAW this instruction. Basic  Mission  Capable  Aircrew  Member—An  aircrew  member  who  has  satisfactorily completed  mission  qualification,  and  is  maintaining  50  percent  of  the  applicable  mission qualification  currency  requirements,  of  this  instruction.    Basic  mission  capable  crewmembers may perform primary crew duties on any unilateral training mission.  For other missions, the unit commander  should  determine  the  readiness  of  each  basic  mission  capable  crewmember  to perform primary crew duties. Calendar Month—Requirements are due once per month and not necessarily associated with a 30/60  day  requirement.    For  example,  an  aircrew  member  could  accomplish  the  event  on  1 February and then on 31 March the following month and still fulfill the requirement. Conversion Training—Training is normally associated with a unit conversion to another MDS.  Conversion training requires completion of a formal school initial qualification course.  For unit conversions, when formal school courses are not available to handle the throughput, MAJCOMs should develop, and coordinate with the training command, in-unit training plans that maximize use of highly experienced personnel as the initial cadre. Core  Mission  Events—A  crewmember  should  be  qualified  in  all  core  mission  events  to  be considered Mission Ready (MR) or Mission Capable (MC).  To determine how non-currency in any  core  mission  event  affects  overall  mission  currency  refer  to  the  aircraft’s  Mission  Ready Flying Requirements Table (RTM MR table).  Loss  of qualification in  any core mission event, results  in  loss  of  overall  mission  qualification.    Consider  a  core  mission  event  an  instructor  certified  event  when  it  is  not  required  to  be  evaluated  on  the  Initial  Mission Evaluation.  Squadrons will maintain at least 100 percent of their required manning as MR. (T-2)   AFSOC unit CC/DO should determine the status/qualification of crewmembers in excess of 100 percent manning requirement. Difference Training—Training accomplished when changing between same design aircraft and the  amount  of  training  needed  for  qualification  does  not  warrant  attendance  at  a  formal qualification course. Direct Support Operator (DSO)—An AFSOC aircrew position responsible for providing threat warning  and  enhanced  situational  awareness  to  SOF  missions  utilizing  intelligence  data  and expertise in the area of operations. Dual  Qualified—A crewmember  who is  qualified in  more than one  crew position in  the same MDS. Event—A  training  item  to  be  accomplished.  Multiple  events  may  be  completed  and  logged during a sortie unless specifically excluded elsewhere in this instruction. Formal  School  Courseware—Training materials and programs  developed for training  aircrew members  at  formal  schools.    It  includes  all  student  study  guides,  workbooks,  computer-based   46  AFI11-2AC-130V1  19 JUNE 2015 training lessons, instructor guides, and AF Form 4111, Individual Mission Grade Record, related to the specific course. Formation  Operations—Accomplish  IAW  applicable  volume(s)  of  AFSOCI  11-202,  AFI 112AC-130, Vol 3, T.O. 1-1C-1-20, and T.O. 1-1C-1-29.  AFSOC guidance should never be less restrictive  than  the  formation  definitions  found  in  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  “Formation  Flight,” “Nonstandard Formation,” and “Standard Formation.”  Formation operations place all aircraft in a  critical  phase  of  flight  which  requires  constant  vigilance,  strict  discipline,  and  polished  crew coordination for mission accomplishment.  Training should ensure aircrew can think and plan for multiple aircraft instead of single ship operations. Infrared  Detection  System  (IDS)—A  passive  navigation/sensor  system  which  detects  radiant infrared energy. Instructor  Certified  Events—Training given to  an aircrew member that requires an instructor to certify the student's attainment of the required proficiency and knowledge levels as specified in courseware and, if appropriate, AF Form 4111.  Instructor certified events are documented in AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381. Mission  Design  and  Series  (MDS)  for  Aircraft—The  official  designation  for  aerospace vehicles used to represent a specific category of aerospace vehicles for operations, support, and documentation purposes. Mission  Essential  Task  List  (METL)—Combat-oriented  training  requirements.    All  AFSOC aircrew training requirements should be in support of unit METLs. Mission  Events—The squadron Doctrinal  (DOC) Statement defines required crew capabilities.  These capabilities/tactics/events can be categorized as either Core or Special Mission. Mission  Oriented  Simulator  Training—Training  conducted  in  a  WST  or  MRD  that incorporates a full mission profile.  The focus of this training should be crew coordination and problem solving. Mission  Ready  Aircrew  Member—An  aircrew  member  who  has  satisfactorily  completed mission  qualification  and  is  maintaining  all  of  the  applicable  mission  qualification  currency requirements of this instruction. Multiple Qualification—A crewmember who is qualified in more than one MDS. Projectile  Impact  Point  Prediction  (PIPP)—An  AC-130U  radar  mode  that  estimates  the impact position of 40MM and 105MM projectiles using the APQ-180 radar set. Self-Contained  Approach  (SCA)—An  approach  conducted  using  self-contained  navigation systems on the aircraft. Special Mission Events—Some MR/MC crewmembers should carry additional qualifications in special  mission  events.    Unit  CC/DO  determines  which  crewmembers  to  qualify  in  special mission events.  Unit CC/DO will determine if special mission events have affected C- rating and report  variations  through  Status  Of  Resources  and  Training  Systems  (SORTS).  (T-3)  Special mission requirements are also shown in the RTM MR table. Syllabus  Deviation—A  syllabus  deviation  is  any  unplanned  variation  from  syllabus  or equivalent  directed  requirement  such  as  prerequisite  flow,  turn  times,  landing  currency, minimum number of events, etc. AFI11-2AC-130V1  19 JUNE 2015   47  Syllabus  Waivers—A  planned  one-time  exception  to  the  syllabus  used  to  enhance  or accommodate student training in special or unusual circumstances. Total Flying Time—Total time for all aircraft flown in military service to include student time.  Ensure time accumulated is in the aircrew member's current rating (i.e., pilot, navigator, etc.). Training  Device—A  hardware  device  that  permits  learning,  development,  and  the  practice  of skills  and  procedures  necessary  for  understanding  and  operating  the  integrated  systems  of  a specific prime mission system. Training Status—A deficient status in which a crewmember should fly under the supervision of an  instructor  when  occupying  a  primary  crew  position.  Once  deficient  items  are  corrected,  the crewmember is removed from training status. Volume—–For the purposes of this instruction, volume refers to the number of events an aircrew member should accomplish in a given period of time (i.e., quarterly or semiannually).
