This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) for AFSC 2R0X1, Maintenance Management Analysis Specialty is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty.  The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.  A copy of the current CFETP is available for review/download at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/  NOTE:    Civilians  occupying  associated  positions  will  use  Part  II  to  support  duty  position qualification training.  2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; supervisors use both parts to plan, manage, and control training.  2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan.  Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path.  Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other).  Section D indicates resource constraints.  Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities.  2.2.    Part  II  includes  the  following:    Section  A  contains  the  course  objective  list  and  training standards  supervisors  use  to  determine  if  Airmen  have  satisfied  Air  Education  and  Training Command (AETC) training requirements.  Section B identifies available support materials.  An example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP) developed to support proficiency training.  Section C identifies a training course index supervisors use to determine resources available to support training; included here are both mandatory and optional courses.  Section D identifies MAJCOM  unique  training  requirements  supervisors  use  to  determine  additional  training requirement unique to the MAJCOM.  Section E identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, and technical references to support training; AETC conducted training; wartime course requirements; core tasks; and correspondence course requirements.  3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career.  This plan will enable us to train today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.      1        ABBREVIATIONS / TERMS EXPLAINED  Advanced Training (AT):  Formal course which provides individuals who are qualified in one or more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills/knowledge to enhance their expertise in the career field.

Purpose of the CFETP.  This CFETP provides information necessary for AFCFM, MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training that individuals in AFSC 2R0X1 should receive to develop and progress throughout their career.    This  plan  identifies  initial  skills,  upgrade,  qualification,  advanced,  and  proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one or more of the technical training wings.  Upgrade training identifies  the  mandatory  courses,  task  qualification  requirements,  and  correspondence  course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position. This training  program  occurs  both  during  and  after  the  upgrade  training  process.    It  is  designed  to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty  training  for  selected  Airmen.    Proficiency  training  is  additional  training,  either  in-residence, exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes. Some are:  1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.    Also,  it  is  used  to  help  supervisors  identify  training  at  the  appropriate  point  in  an individual’s career.  1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.  1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method.  1.4. Identifies major resource constraints which impact full implementation of the desired career field training process.  2.  Use of the CFETP.  The CFETP will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.  2.1.  AETC  training  personnel  will  develop/revise  formal  resident,  non-resident,  field  and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.  2.2. MFMs ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency  requirements.    Identified  requirements  can  be  satisfied  by  OJT,  resident  training, contract training, or  exportable courses.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFS is identified for inclusion into this plan and must not duplicate other available training resources.   4  2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AETC training manager for this specialty will initiate an annual review of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy.  Use the list of courses in Part II to eliminate duplicate training.  Section B – Air Force Specialty Progression and Information  4.   Specialty Description.  4.1.   Specialty Summary.

Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level play  an important role in the Air Force’s ability to accomplish its mission.   It is  essential for everyone  involved  in  training  to  do  his  or  her  part  to  plan,  manage,  and  conduct  an  effective training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives necessary training at appropriate points in their career.  The following narrative and AFSC 2R0X1 Career Field tables identify the skill / career progression.  5.2.  Apprentice  (3)  Level.    Following  Basic  Military  Training,  initial  skills  training  will  be provided to members in a resident course at the 82d Training Wing, Sheppard AFB TX.  The course  will  lay  the  foundation  for  additional  training  at  the  graduate's  first  duty  assignment. Trainees will utilize the Career Development Course (CDC), and task qualification training to progress  in  their  career  field.    Upon  completion  of  CDC  2R051  and  Air  Force  core  task qualifications, the trainee should complete other available duty position training.  5.3  Journeyman  (5)  Level.    Once  upgraded  to  the  5-level,  the  journeyman  will  enter  into continuation training that will broaden their experience base by increasing their knowledge and skill  in  troubleshooting  and  solving  more  complex  problems.    5-levels  may  be  assigned  job positions such as maintenance management analyst (MMA), database manager (DBM), aircraft maintenance unit (AMU) analyst, wing analyst, Cyber/Space/Communication Systems analyst and various staff positions.  5-levels will attend Airman Leadership School (ALS) to enhance their Professional Military Education (PME).  After attending the Air Force Training course, 5-levels can be considered for appointment as trainers.  Trainers must be qualified to perform the task to be trained.  CDC study is continued to prepare for Weighted Airman Promotion testing.  Airmen should also consider continuing their formal education by pursuing a Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree.  5.4. Craftsman (7) Level.  A craftsman can expect to fill various supervisory and management positions such as maintenance management analyst, wing database manager, NCOIC database management,  wing  analyst,  AMU  analyst,  NCOIC  AMU  Analysis,  NCOIC  Wing  Analysis, element  chief,  Cyber/Space/Communication  Systems  analyst  and  various  staff  positions.  Exportable courses, MAJCOM, and unit directed courses are also available.  Seven-levels should take  courses  or  obtain  added  knowledge  of  management  of  resources  and  personnel,  and  be thoroughly familiar with all facets of maintenance operations.  Continue academic education IAW AFI 36-2301.  In addition, individuals will complete the appropriate PME requirements.  5.5.  Superintendent  (9)  Level.    A  9-level  can  be  expected  to  fill  the  position  of  MAJCOM Functional  Manager  or  Maintenance  Operations  (MO)  Superintendent,  with  knowledge  of Maintenance Management Analysis, Maintenance Production Management, Engine Management, Supply,  Maintenance  Training  Management,  Cyber/Space/Communication,  Maintenance Operations  Center  (MOC),  Quality  Assurance  (QA),  Weapons  Standardization  and  Programs.  Additional  training  in  the  areas  of  budget,  manpower,  resources,  and  personnel  management should  be  pursued  through  continuing  education.    In  addition,  individuals  will  complete  the appropriate PME requirements. Additional higher education and completion of courses outside their career AFS is also recommended. 6   6.  Training Decisions.  This CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the 2R0X1 Maintenance Management Analysis career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet these training  requirements.    The  strategy  must  ensure  we  develop  affordable  training,  eliminate duplication, and prevent a fragmented approach to training.  The following training decisions were made at the Career Field U&TW held at Sheppard AFB TX from 19-22 January 2016.  6.1 Initial Skills.   The 3-level resident course provides training in database management and analysis functions.  The U&TW working group members revised the 3-level course.  The course stayed the same with several minor changes.  The team added several items to include enhanced G081 training, refined IMDS training and fifth generation maintenance information systems to better reflect current duties of maintenance analysts.    6.2.  Five  Level  Upgrade  Requirements.    To  upgrade  to  the  5-level,  personnel  must  meet educational and training requirements as listed in table A8.1. Enlisted Career Path. The U&TW working group made revisions to the supplemental course.  The revisions included the removal of IMDS requirements process and utilities objectives from the course.  The team removed Structured Query Language (SQL) and Interactive Processor Facility (IPF) requirements. Requirements were added to emphasize the building and sharing of queries and the modification of reports using the two primary MIS. LIMS-EV and GCSS-AFDS were also added as well as presentation building.  Overall the course was reduced from 27 to 20 days in length.  6.3.  Seven  Level  Upgrade  Requirements.  To  upgrade  to  the  7-level,  personnel  must  meet educational and training requirements and grade requirements as listed in table A8.1. Enlisted Career  Path.    Seven  levels  must  be  a  SSgt  with  12  months  OJT,  complete  core  task  training, complete  7-level  CDC,  and  complete  the  7-level  resident  course  at  Sheppard  AFB  Texas  for upgrade to the Craftsman level. The U&TW working group made multiple changes to the 7-level course.  The largest change resulted in a reduction of the QLP, ECL and SQL training requirements and the deletion of Global Command Support System – Air Force Data System (GCSS-AFDS) report creation/manipulation training.  Overall, the course length was reduced from 20 days to 10 days.  The Air National Guard/Air Force Reserve Command unique course will no longer be used and all students regardless of component will attend the improved 10 day Craftsman course.  6.4. Continuation Training.  Any additional knowledge and skill requirements which were not taught through initial or upgrade training are assigned to unit training or Training Detachments. The  purpose  of  the  continuation  training  program  is  to  provide  additional  training  exceeding minimum  upgrade  training  requirements  with  emphasis  on  present  and  future  duty  positions.  MAJCOMs  develop  a  proficiency  training  program  that  ensures  individuals  in  the  2R0X1 Maintenance Management Analysis career field receive necessary training at the appropriate point in their career.  The program identifies both mandatory and optional training requirements.   7  7.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  CCAF offers and awards job-related associate in  applied  science  degrees  and  other  academic  credentials  that  enhance  mission  readiness, contribute to recruiting, assist in retention and support the career transitions of Air Force enlisted members.  The college works with Air Force training centers, regional accrediting agencies, and hundreds of cooperating civilian colleges and universities. The technical nature of most Air Force courses, placed at the same level with college studies, can award Airmen full college credits for most of what they learn through formal coursework and on-the-job training. Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon completion of basic military training.  CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Science Degree.  In addition to its associate degree program, CCAF offers the following:  7.1. Occupational Instructor Certification.

Each proficiency coded STS task or knowledge item taught at the technical school is measured through the use of an objective.  An objective is a written instruction for the student so he or she knows what is expected of them to successfully complete training on each task.  Each objective consists of a condition, behavior, and standard.  The condition is the setting in which the training takes place (i.e. TOs, type of equipment, etc.).  The behavior is the observable portion of the objective (i.e. perform an operational check).  The standard is the level of performance that is measured to ensure the STS proficiency code level is attained.  Each objective uses letter codes(s) to identify how it is measured.  All objectives use the PC code that indicates a progress check is used to measure subject or task knowledge.  “W” indicates a comprehensive written test and is used to measure the subject or task knowledge at the end of a block of instruction.  “PC/W” indicates a subject or task knowledge progress check and a separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test.  2.  Standard.  The standard for written examinations is 70%. Standards for performance objectives are indicated in the objective and are also indicated on the individual progress check checklist.  The checklist is used by the instructor to document each student’s progress on each task.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.  Students must satisfactorily complete all PCs prior to taking the written test.   3.  Proficiency Level.  Review column 4A of the STS to determine the proficiency level of a particular task or knowledge item.  Review the course objective list to determine which STS item the objective supports.  Review the proficiency code key in Part II, Section E of this CFETP for an explanation of the proficiency codes.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the students can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step by step procedures for doing the task.  4.  Course Objectives.  A detailed listing of initial skills or craftsman course objectives may be obtained by submitting a written request to 363 TRS/TRR, 520 Missile Road, Sheppard AFB TX 76311 or contact the OPR by telephone at DSN 736-8777.
