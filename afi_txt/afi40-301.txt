The  FAP  personnel  provide expert  training  and  consultation  services  to  its  key  customers,  including  active  component members, their families, and other eligible beneficiaries, unit leaders, and other helping agencies. (T-0).  AF FAP personnel collect, maintain, analyze, and report data on domestic abuse and child maltreatment.    In  concert  with  installation  and  community  agencies,  the  AF  FAP  personnel provide a continuum of services designed to build community health and resilience by reducing domestic abuse and child maltreatment and promote family, community, and mission readiness.  (T-0). 2.1.1.   Provides services to AFRC.  (T-0). 2.1.1.1.    This  instruction  applies  to  all  military  and  civilian  AF  personnel  and  their dependents  entitled  to  receive  medical  care  in  a  MTF  as  specified  in  AFI  41-210, including reservists and their families.  Collaboration between the FAP staff and reserve personnel  is  highly  encouraged  and  may  include  consultation,  one-time  emergency evaluations,  referrals,  prevention,  and  education.    Any  duty  to  warn  requirements  must result in a timely referral to the appropriate non-military authority. 2.1.1.2.    The  AFRC  does  not  maintain  a  separate  Reserve  FAP.    Efforts  to  minimize domestic  abuse  and  child  maltreatment  and  its  effect  on  mission  readiness  to  Reserve forces  are  limited  to  preventive  education,  identification,  emergency  intervention,  and referrals,  when  indicated.    Allegations  of  domestic  abuse  and  child  maltreatment involving reserve airmen and/or their families (when not eligible for care in a MTF) are routinely  managed  by  civilian  agencies  in  conjunction  with  civilian  law  enforcement organizations. 2.1.2.   Provides Services to Air National Guard (ANG) when ANG members are activated in Title 10 or Title 32 status and are not in the dual status Technician Program.  All referrals for suspected domestic abuse and child maltreatment will be handled like any active component maltreatment referral, including presentation to CRB.  When a member who is suspected of domestic  abuse  and/or  child  maltreatment  is  in  the  Technician  Program,  the  victims  should be  provided  advocacy  to  address  immediate  safety  issues  and  assisted  with  referrals  to  the community for ongoing services.  These incidents are not to be taken to the Central Registry Board for disposition; however, command should be notified and kept abreast of any serious safety or fitness for duty concerns.  The FAP will offer victim advocacy and safety planning to the victim. 2.1.3.    Develops  and  implement  FAP  initiatives  in  support  of  MAJCOMs  via  coordination with MAJCOM Behavioral Health Consultants. 2.2.    FAP  Components.  The  FAP  is  comprised  of  three  principal  components:    Prevention (Prevention/Outreach Program, NPSP, and FAST); Maltreatment Intervention; and Research and Program Evaluation.  AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 23 2.2.1.   The FAP Prevention is the focal point for the FAP outreach and prevention services.  The  Prevention  and  Outreach  Program  is  an  assets-based  support  program  that  provides primary prevention and public awareness on maltreatment and support to the community, and secondary  prevention  services  to  clients  with  indicators  of  risk  associated  with  partner violence or child maltreatment. 2.2.1.1.    All  prevention  program  interventions  including  consultation  and  coaching, training, and skill development, will be provided using evidence-informed programs and approaches for supporting protective factors as determined by AF FAP.  FAOM provides a secondary prevention   assessment and activity plan for programs and services targeting individual,  couple,  or  group  psychosocial  skill  development.    Training,  consultation, coaching, including couple relationship and family management, parenting of age 3 and above,  stress  and  anger  management  and  other  proactive  problem-solving  and  strength-based services are also offered.  (T-0). 2.2.1.1.1.   The FAOM manages the Prevention and Outreach Program and practices within  the  parameters  and  scope  of  prevention.    Primary  prevention  includes consultation and training to leadership healthcare providers within the MTF, helping agencies, behavioral health marketing-education and special emphasis month events.  The  FAO  will  have  final  approval  for  behavioral  health  education  marketing, messaging and campaign plans.  (T-0). 2.2.1.2.  The  FAOM  and/or  FAIS  will  support  self-referral,  agency,  squadron,  and provider  referral  of  clients  meeting  eligibility  for  secondary  prevention  services  with early  intervention  to  deter  or  mitigate  risk.    (T-1).    Eligibility  for  Prevention/Outreach Program  secondary  prevention  is  defined  as  active  component  and  family  member beneficiaries  with  risk  factors  for  domestic  abuse  or  child  maltreatment.    Adult  clients reported for alleged domestic abuse or child maltreatment will be referred by the Family Advocacy  Treatment  Manager  (FATM),  to  the  Family  Advocacy  Safety  Education Seminar (FASES), or its equivalent program, after the intake assessment and before CRB determinations.    (T-1).    After  completion  of  FASES,  the  client  may  be  referred  to secondary prevention services to augment treatment, but not in lieu of treatment.  Clients that recidivate within the first year after attending FASES, may be re-referred to FASES or  its  equivalent  services  of  the  Prevention/Outreach  Program  for  additional  support toward  readiness  for  change  and/or  other  support  services  offered  through  FAP prevention.  FATMs and FAOMs will screen and coordinate these maltreatment clients to identify  levels  of  hostility,  levels  of  risk,  and  for  the  appropriateness  and  safety  of  the clients for secondary prevention services through the Prevention and Outreach Program.  (T-1). 2.2.1.3.    Secondary  Prevention  is  delivered  using  a  prevention  assessment,  intervention training and activity plan, and AF FAP approved evidence-based/informed programs and measures as the primary intervention tool.  Prescribed standardized Pre and Post-tests are utilized by all Prevention and Outreach Program providers in the evaluation of secondary prevention and outreach services outcomes.  A standard system of scoring and analysis of data  will  be  in  place  for  secondary  prevention  with  guidelines  for  facilitating  and documenting  this  process.    A  metric  for  marketing-education  and  other  prevention activities will be established and followed for analysis of outcomes.  During the course of  24 AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 prevention/outreach  services,  any  indication  of  domestic  abuse,  child  maltreatment,  or imminent danger to self or others will be reported/referred to the FAO.  (T-1). 2.2.1.4.  Documentation of primary and secondary prevention services, Behavioral Health Education  and  Social  Marketing,  and  Family  Violence  Education  and  Prevention Training are entered and maintained in the Outreach Prevention Automated Log (OPAL) or designated dashboard.  Anyone can access or refer a member for secondary prevention services.  Referrals will be accepted congruent with eligibility requirements.  (T-1). 2.2.1.5.  Commanders  will  support  active  component  member  with  indicators  of  risk through  early  identification  and  intervention  and  by  recommending  active  component member  participation  in  FAP  Prevention  and  Outreach  services.    (T-1).    The  rules  of confidentiality will be observed in concert with the FAP protocol as appropriate.  (T-1). 2.2.1.6.   Prevention Program Services Integration with Installation Functions: 2.2.1.6.1.   The FAP coordinates with and supports IDS initiatives.  The FAOM/FAIS is assigned as the official FAP representative to the IDS.  The FAP data requests or reports will be released only after review and expressed approval and signature of the FAO.  (T-1). 2.2.1.6.2.    The  FAOM  and  FAIS  provide  annual  Family  Violence  Education  and Prevention Training with support of the Domestic Abuse Victim Advocate (DAVA).  Training  will  include  dynamics  of  domestic  abuse  and  child  maltreatment, identification and referral procedures, and an overview of the coordinated community response  model  and  other  key  military  and  community  resources  to  Sq/CCs,  CCFs, and  joint-base  equivalents.    A  senior  leader  briefing  will  also  be  provided  to  the Installation  CC,  Vice  CC,  Group  CCs,  Command  Chief  Master  Sergeant  and  joint-base service equivalents.  Key maltreatment information will be provided to frontline supervisors.  Tenant units will be offered the opportunity to receive training.  (T-0). 2.2.1.6.3.   IAW DODI 6400.06, periodic and mandatory training to key agencies will be  provided  by  the  FAOM/FAIS  and  DAVA  on  key  policies  and  procedures regarding the role of the victim advocate and the advocacy services available through the FAP.   To the extent possible, education and awareness  activities will also  target family members.  (T-0). 2.2.1.6.4.  The  FAP  Prevention/Outreach  Program  is  OPR  for  Family  Violence Education and Prevention Training.  The FAOM Manager will provide annual Family Violence Education and Prevention Training to Group CCs, Sq CCs, CCFs, frontline supervisors  and  joint-base  equivalents,  support  agencies  including  MTF  healthcare provider  professional  and  support  staff  (as  defined  by  DOD),  JA,  SFS,  AFOSI, A&FRC,  Child  Development  Center  (CDC),  Family  Child  Care  Providers,  Youth Center,  DODEA,  FAC,  IDS,  SARC,  Newcomer  Orientation  Program  and  other  key personnel IAW DODI 6400.6.  (T-0).  A senior leader FAP briefing will be provided to  the  Installation  CC,  Vice  CC,  MSG/CC,  Command  Chief  Master  Sergeant  and joint-base service equivalents.  (T-0).    AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 25 2.2.2.    The  New  Parent  Support  Program  (NPSP)  is  a  secondary  prevention  program  that uses  an  intensive,  voluntary  home  visitation  model  to  provide  education  and  supportive services  to  families  with  children  from  birth  to  three  years  of  age,  including  the  prenatal period.  The Family Advocacy Nurse (FAN) with support from the FAP team and the FAC, delivers  NPSP  services  to  community  members  eligible  for  care  in  the  MTF,  under  the oversight of the FAO.  (T-0). 2.2.2.1.  Families are eligible for NPSP when: 2.2.2.1.1.   A parent is eligible for military medical care.  For families where only one parent  is  eligible  for  military  medical  care,  NPSP  services  will  only  be  provided  to the  eligible  parent.    The  eligible  parent  must  complete  NPSP  paperwork,  and  only his/her information will be entered into FAPNet.  The eligible parent must be present at all contacts with the family.  (T-0). 2.2.2.1.2.    Individual/family  is  pregnant,  has  a  pregnant  partner,  and/or  has  a  child under the age of 3 years.  (T-0). 2.2.2.1.3.  There  is  no  open  “met  criteria”  maltreatment  incident,  or  pending maltreatment allegation.  (T-0). 2.2.2.1.4.    Maltreatment  cases  should  not  be  closed  as  long  as  there  is  more  than minimal  risk  for  maltreatment,  unless  the  client  is  refusing  services.    It  is  not appropriate  to  close  a  maltreatment  record  and  immediately  open  an  NPSP  record.  Consideration should be made to assigning a social worker as case manager for NPSP cases opened for families with a recent maltreatment case, to ensure appropriate level of care.  (T-1). 2.2.2.2.      The  FAO,  in  collaboration  with  the  referring  practitioner,  may  consider  an initial  referral  for  Failure  to  Thrive  (FTT)  as  a  prevention  referral  to  NPSP  if  the condition is new and the following efforts have not yet been tried with the family: 2.2.2.2.1.   Increase frequency of pediatric appointments and weight checks 2.2.2.2.2.   Referral to a nutritionist 2.2.2.2.3.   Referral to NPSP 2.2.2.2.4.   The FAO can assign such referrals to the FAN for supportive services in NPSP  and  should  also  consider  assigning  a  social  worker  to  augment  the  Family Service Plan.  Due to the fragile nature of children diagnosed as FTT, it is important that  FTT  clients  are  managed  as  priority  clients  on  a  prevention  case  load.    Close communication  between  the  FAP  staff  and  the  child’s  pediatric  provider  must  be initiated and sustained, the case should be regularly staffed, and case managers must notify the FAO immediately if clients do not keep NPSP appointments and/or do not adhere to the Family Service Plan.  A maltreatment referral will be made should the pediatric provider  and/or the FAP  staff suspect  the child has become or is at  risk of becoming malnourished due to parental or caregiver neglect.  (T-1). 2.2.2.3.   NPSP services are always voluntary on the part of the client/prospective client.  Services  provided  use  a  strengths-based  family  centered  developmental  approach  that promotes  protective  factors  associated  with  the  reduction  of  risk  for  child  abuse  and neglect  (nurturing  and  attachment,  knowledge  of  parenting  and  child  development,  26 AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 concrete supports in times of need, social connections, parental resilience, and social and emotional  competence  of  children).    Services  are  provided  in  a  manner  sensitive  to cultural  differences.    Involvement  of  both  parents  in  NPSP  services  is  promoted,  when applicable.  (T-0). 2.2.2.4.  Key components of the NPSP include: 2.2.2.4.1.   Marketing and outreach to the target population and referral sources.  (T-0). 2.2.2.4.2.    Establishment  of  an  effective  screening  process  based  on  empirically determined  protective  and  risk  factors  associated  with  child  abuse  and  neglect  and risk  factors  for  domestic  abuse,  using  the  AF  Family  Needs  Screener  (FNS),  to identify expectant and new parents whose life circumstances may place them at risk.  (T-0). 2.2.2.4.2.1.    The  FNS  will  be  scored  within  3  duty  days  of  completion  by  the client.  (T-1). 2.2.2.4.2.2.    FNSs  with  High  Need  scores  and  FNSs  with  Low  Need  scores identified  as  having  areas  of  potential  concern  (completed  by  single  active component member, written comments on FNS, 10 or more items not completed, and/or  referral  information  indicating  family  members  are  at  risk)  will  be reviewed  by  the  FAN/FATM/FAIS  immediately,  to  determine  intervention.    (T-1).  2.2.2.4.2.3.    The  FNS  is  scored  and  entered  into  the  FAPNet  automated system.  (T-0). 2.2.2.5.  The  FAN/FATM/FAIS  will  contact  prospective  NPSP  participants  with  High Need  FNS  scores  and/or  other  areas  of  potential  concern  and  offer  services  within  45 calendar  days  of  FNS  completion  or  sooner  if  indicated  by  screener  or  referral information.  (T-1). 2.2.2.6.    Low  Need  NPSP  families  may  receive  up  to  2  home  visits.   The FAN/FATM/FAIS  will  conduct  an  NPSP  assessment  for  these  families,  to  include assessment  for  child  and  partner  maltreatment  risk  factors,  protective  factors  and  abuse dynamics  within  the  family.    Education  related  to  SBS/AHT,  SUID  and  safe  sleeping environment will be provided to participating parents at the home visits.  (T-1). 2.2.2.7.   The cases of all  families who screen as High Need on the FNS  and/or receive home visits will be staffed within 45 days of the first home visit at the NPSP team Case Staffing meeting, chaired by the FAO and occurring at least monthly.

If  review  of  AHLTA  or  interview  with  an  NPSP  client  reveals  that  they  are currently  receiving  services  in  ADAPT  and/or  the  Mental  Health  Clinic  (MHC),  the NPSP provider will discuss with the client the need to consult with the other provider(s) and then make contact with that provider, for the purpose of continuity of care.  All open NPSP cases for clients who are also being seen by another MH provider (in ADAPT or the  MHC)  will  be  staffed  at  the  Multidisciplinary  Clinical  Case  Conference  (MCCC).  The NPSP provider will protect the confidentiality of other family members.  (T-1). 2.2.2.9.    All  families  assessed  as  being  High  Need  will  be  offered  intensive  home visitation services, which include: 2.2.2.9.1.   Home visits conducted at least twice monthly.  (T-0). 2.2.2.9.2.

Should a maltreatment allegation occur while a family is receiving NPSP services, the NPSP record will remain open until  a determination is made by the CRB.  The NPSP case will be  closed if the incident  “Meets  Criteria.”   If the incident “Does Not Meet Criteria,” NPSP services may continue.  (T-0). 2.2.2.11.    The  NPSP  team  consists  of  the  FAO,  FAN,  FATM,  FAIS,  FAOM,  FAPA and/or MH Technician,  where available.   At some small  locations, less  than a  full FAP team is authorized.  If a FAN position is not assigned to the FAP, full implementation of the  NPSP  Model  is  not  required;  screening  will  not  be  performed,  direct  clinical  NPSP services will not be provided to families in the target population, and the FAPNet NPSP automated documentation system will not be used for documentation.  (T-1). 2.2.2.12.    NPSP  services  will  be  documented  in  the  FAPNet  NPSP  automated documentation  system  in  a  manner  that  ensures  continuity  and  quality  of  care  and facilitates compliance with DOD metric outcome reporting requirements.  (T-0). 2.2.2.12.1.    The  quality  of  NPSP  documentation  will  be  sufficient  to  allow  NPSP staff to:  (T-1). 2.2.2.12.1.1.

When  a  NPSP  client  requests  a  restricted  report  of  domestic  violence, two records will be open on the client in the FAP office as follows:  (T-1). 2.2.2.12.6.1.    The  NPSP  record  will  be  maintained  by  the  NPSP  case  manager until or unless a CRB determination of “met criteria” is made or the NPSP record closes for another reason. 2.2.2.12.6.2.    A  Restricted  report  maltreatment  record  will  be  established  when the client is determined to be eligible for services under a restricted report. 2.2.2.12.6.3.    Both  records  will  indicate  the  existence  of  the  other  record.    The case will be staffed by both NPSP case manager and maltreatment case manager monthly.  The first staffing will be the NPSP Case Staffing where the request for a restricted report is  discussed.   If the  client  is  offered a restricted report, the case will be staffed at the CCS monthly.  Documentation of the monthly staffing will be placed in both records.  The safety of the home environment for home visitors will be regularly assessed. 2.2.2.12.7.   NPSP records will be maintained under a double lock system for 2 years after case closure and then shredded.  (T-1). 2.2.2.12.8.    Closed  NPSP  records  will  only  be  transferred  to  another  FAP  upon receipt of a written request that includes a release of information  consent from  each participating family member.  (T-1).  AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 31 2.2.2.12.9.    If  a  maltreatment  allegation  occurs  while  a  family  is  receiving  NPSP services,  the  NPSP  record  will  remain  open  until  a  determination  is  made  by  the CRB.  (T-1). 2.2.2.12.9.1.    If  the  FATM/FAIS  is  the  NPSP  case  manager,  and  there  is  an allegation of maltreatment, the FATM/FAIS will:  document in FASOR any visits prior  to  CRB  determination,  utilize  a  blank  SF600  note  in  FAPNet  NPSP  to indicate that a client contact has taken place and that specifics of the contact are located in FASOR. 2.2.2.12.9.2.   If the FAN is the NPSP case manager and there is an allegation of maltreatment,  the  FAN  will:  continue  to  document  client  contacts  in  FAPNet NPSP,  and  write  a  brief  SF600  note  in  FAPNet  NPSP  indicating  that  a maltreatment allegation has been made. 2.2.2.12.9.3.   The NPSP case will be  closed if the incident  “Meets  Criteria.”   If the  incident  “Does  Not  Meet  Criteria,”  NPSP  services  may  continue  with documentation in the NPSP record. 2.2.2.12.10.   A review process will be established to ensure quality of clinical NPSP services  and  documentation  in  the  NPSP  record,  IAW  AFI  44-119.    The  FAO  and FAN  will  consult  with  the  MTF  Chief  Nurse  to  ensure  that  a  nursing  professional reviews  the  quality  of  nursing  intervention  in  the  NPSP.    A  FAN  Peer  Review checklist  that  may  be  used  for  this  is  included  in  the  FAPNet  NPSP  automated system. 2.2.2.12.11.    The  FAO  will  ensure  that  at  least  10%  of  each  NPSP  case  manager’s High  Need  records  are  reviewed  on  a  quarterly  basis  using  the  FAPNet  NPSP automated system record review process.  (T-1). 2.2.2.12.12.  NPSP  records  will  be  maintained  in  accordance  with  DOD  guidance.  (T-0). 2.2.3.  FAST services provide psychosocial assessments and short-term therapy to families at risk for domestic abuse or child maltreatment where there is no open maltreatment record and the family is not eligible for NPSP.  (T-1). 2.2.3.1.    FAST  services  to  eligible  families  will  include  psychosocial  assessment  of identified clients, including assessment of risk for family maltreatment.  (T-1). 2.2.3.1.1.  Assessment  will maltreatment.  (T-1). include risk factors  or  dynamics indicative  of 2.2.3.1.2.    An  intervention  plan  is  developed  in  collaboration  with  the  family members receiving FAST services.  (T-1). 2.2.3.1.3.    Provide  information  and  referral  services,  crisis  intervention,  brief/short-term  therapy,  and/or  supportive  interventions  focused  on  agreed  upon  goals  and objectives and evaluation of FAST services effectiveness.  (T-1). 2.2.3.2.    Clinical  consultation  for  the  FAP  providers  of  open  FAST  cases  will  occur  as needed at the CCS or one-on-one with the FAO.  (T-1).  32 AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 2.2.3.2.1.    The FAP providers open and close FAST cases upon agreement with the client.    There  is  no  requirement  to  staff  a  FAST  case  at  the  CCS.    However,  it  is strongly  recommended  that  FAST  cases  remaining  open  six-months  or  longer  be staffed at CCS to ensure FAST services are the most appropriate for this client.  (T-1). 2.2.3.2.2.   FAST services may be provided in the client’s home or in the FAP office, depending on the needs or preference of the client.  The FAP staff will consider safety issues when making home visits.  (T-1). 2.2.4.   Maltreatment Intervention. 2.2.4.1.   The FAP clinical providers offer comprehensive family assessments, safety and intervention planning, and case management to all eligible beneficiaries where there is an alleged incident of domestic abuse or child maltreatment.  (T-0). 2.2.4.2.    The  FAP  providers  recommend  and  offer  clinical  treatment  to  eligible beneficiaries where a referral meets standardized criteria.  (T-0). 2.2.4.3.    The  FAP  providers  coordinate  with  command,  law  enforcement  agencies, victim  advocates,  local  child  protective  services,  and  other  helping  agencies  to  deter recurrence of domestic abuse or child maltreatment in families served.  (T-0). 2.2.4.4.    The  FAP  Providers  will  inform  child  sexual  assault  or  other  sexually  related offense  victims  and  non-offending  parents  of  the  availability  of  a  Special  Victims Counsel (SVC) as soon as the member or dependent seeks assistance. 2.2.4.5.    The  FAP  providers  collaborate  with  other  medical  and  mental  health professionals,  community  service  providers,  and  the  following  FAP  management  teams to provide optimal care and service coordination to their clients.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.  The FAP Incident Management Teams. 2.2.4.5.1.1.    CRB.    The  CRB  is  the  Incident  Determination  Committee  (IDC) (formerly known in DOD as Case Review Committee) for the FAP, and consists of  a  multidisciplinary  team.    The  CRB  makes  administrative  determinations  for suspected  domestic  abuse  and  child  maltreatment  meeting  DOD/AF  definitions, determinations which require entry into the AF Central Registry database.  These decisions are known as incident status determinations (ISDs).  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.   The FAC approves the members and alternates of the CRB, who are appointed in writing by their commander.  (T-0).  The Installation Vice CC chairs the  CRB.    In  his/her  absence,  the  CRB  may  be  chaired  by  the  MSG/CC.    The alternate CRB Chair must be at least a group CC. (T-0).  The CRB members are:  CRB  Chair,  JA,  CCC,  SFS,  AFOSI,  and  the  FAO.    SQ/CCs  are  members  for incidents  involving  members  of  their  squadron.    Active  component  or  civilian Commander of active component alleged offender, victim and sponsor or his/her alternate  only  attend  CRB  for  his/her  squadron’s  incidents.    The  SQ/CC  may appoint a section commander or CCF as his/her alternate.  The CCF is welcome to accompany the CC at the CRB.  If both victim and alleged offender are military members,  and  in  different  squadrons,  both  CCs  are  invited  to  CRB  and  each squadron  gets  a  vote.    CRB  training  certificates,  obtained  upon  completion  of  AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 33 CRB  web  training,  will  serve  as  verification  of  training  and,  for  squadron representatives, verification of their appointment.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.1.   If additional information is required, the CRB Chair may allow a  guest  to  attend.  Active  component  members  and/or  family  members involved  in  the  alleged  incident  (including  attorneys  representing  them)  are not permitted to attend the CRB.  Guests who have information pertaining to a specific  incident  may  be  invited  to  share  their  information  and  participate  in the  discussion  of  that  incident  but  they  do  not  vote  (e.g.,  Child  Protective Services,  Civilian  Law  Enforcement,  or  victim’s  physician).    The  FAP treatment managers and intervention specialists may observe the CRB during orientation  to  their  job  but  will  not  attend  the  CRB  to  participate  in  case discussions.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.2.  A  quorum  is  required  for  the  CRB  to  convene.    The  AFOSI Detachment  representative  will  attend  the  CRB  only  when  preliminary investigative findings are available on an incident being presented to the CRB.  AFOSI will not be counted in the CRB quorum.  AFOSI representatives must accomplish  the  initial  (and  annual)  CRB  computer-based  training  prior  to attending the CRB.  (T-1). 2.2.4.5.1.2.3.  All  members  will  accomplish  initial  and  annual  CRB  web-based  training  located  on  the  AF  FAP  website  prior  to  serving  on  the  CRB.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.4.    Makes  an  ISD  on  each  allegation  of  maltreatment  within  60-days  of  referral,  using  the  incident  and  victim  impact  information  and  the Family  Advocacy  Systems  of  Records  (FASOR)  automated  decision  tree algorithm.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.4.1.    The  CRB  members  will  only  discuss  information  related and  pertinent  to  maltreatment  issues  such  as  the  current  allegation(s),  and the elements each definition requires (e.g., the act and impact information).  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.4.2.   The CRB will not wait for a case to be adjudicated in order to  make  a  determination.    However,  the  CRB  may  need  to  wait  until  the FAP assessment or at least the police/OSI investigation is complete in order to have those results available.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.4.3.      Should  new  information  become  available  after  the  CRB has  made  a  determination  that  could  potentially  change  that  determination, the FAO has discretion to place the incident back on the CRB agenda.  Prior to  placing  an  incident  back  on  the  CRB  agenda,  the  FAO  should  consult with the CRB Chair to take into account the following: 2.2.4.5.1.2.4.3.1.   Acquittal in a criminal case is not justification for an ISDR.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.4.3.2.   The level of proof for criminal prosecution is beyond reasonable doubt.  (T-0).  34 AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 2.2.4.5.1.2.4.3.3.    The  level  of  proof  required  for  a  met  criteria  CRB determination is preponderance of available information.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.5.   Ensures involved adult family members receive notification of CRB  ISDs.    The  FAP  generates  a  letter  with  the  CRB  determination  that  is signed by the Chair at the CRB and given to the unit commander to present to the service member.  A copy of the letter marked //Original Signed// is mailed to the spouse/partner by the FAP.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.6.    Biological/adoptive  parents  are  authorized receive information  on  ISDs  in  which  their  child  is  a  victim  regardless  of  custodial arrangements.    No  disclosure  is  permitted  to  biological/adoptive  parents whose parental rights have been legally terminated.  (T-0). to 2.2.4.5.1.2.7.  The  CRB  should  be  held  in  the  installation  Headquarters conference room.  (T-1).  If the installation Headquarters conference room is not available, it can be held in a conference room not affiliated with the MTF or FAP office.  The CRB will not be held in the MTF or the FAP office.  (T-1).  The CRB will meet at the call of the Chair, normally monthly, unless there are no new referrals requiring determination.  (T-1).  If there are only one or two  new  referrals,  the  CRB  Chair  may  defer  the  CRB  meeting  to  the following month. 2.2.4.5.1.2.8.    CRB  discussions  are  confidential.    The  only  information releasable from CRB proceedings are the ISDs.  The CRB Chair will remind members  and  unit  representatives  of  the  confidential  nature  of  the  CRB  at each meeting.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.9.  Clients,  family  members,  and  attorneys  representing  alleged offenders are not allowed to attend the CRB or the ISDR.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.10.   The agenda will include the date and time the incident is to be presented,  the  incident  number,  sponsor  name,  type  of  victim,  squadron  and the type of maltreatment.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.10.1.    The  agenda  will  not  include  the  rank  of  the  active component member and that information will not be presented to the CRB.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.10.2.      Information  about  each  incident  is  presented  orally  by each CRB member; no written summaries of incidents or read-a-heads will be utilized by the CRB.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.10.3.  Minimal  information  will  be  on  the  CRB  agenda  and agendas will be protected as sensitive information.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.10.4.   Only evidence observed during the FAP assessment (e.g., injuries)  or  collected  in  the  course  of  a  criminal  investigation  will  be presented  to  the  CRB.    Pictures  or  recordings  made  by  victims,  alleged offenders or other involved parties will not be submitted to the CRB unless they have been authenticated by law enforcement prior to the CRB meeting.  (T-0).  AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 35 2.2.4.5.1.2.10.5.  In  making  a  determination,  recantation  by  the  victim  will not,  in  and  of  itself,  be  used  to  conclude  that  maltreatment  did  not  occur.  CRB  member  votes  are  recorded  by  a  show  of  hands  by  voting  members.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.11.   The unit commander will open the initial incident presentation by  sharing  what  he/she  knows  about  the  incident.    Each  CRB  member  will present  relevant  information  on  each  incident  to  facilitate  the  ISD  decision.  The  FAO  will  present  the  information  collected  in  the  FAP  assessment  after all other CRB members have presented information.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.11.1.  The  discussion  will  focus  on  the  current  incident.    Past history  is  not  presented  unless  there  is  an  issue  of  credibility  due  to diverging accounts of the incident or in the case of emotional maltreatment or neglect where a pattern of acts must be established.  CRB members make decisions based on the totality of the available information.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.11.1.1.    In  each  member’s  opinion,  does  the  information presented meet the identified criterion?  A vote to support the criterion is cast even if the supporting information only allows the CRB member to be 51% sure.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.11.1.2.  CRB  members  should  discuss  the  criterion  and  the information  presented  until  each  member  feels  confident  about  how  to vote  on  the  criterion.    Cases  are  decided  on  a  “preponderance  of  the information”  criterion,  not  “beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.”    Thus, obtaining as much descriptive information as possible is critical to both a fair and a focused discussion of the incident.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.11.1.3.  Once  all  relevant  information  has  been  presented, each member will vote “meets criteria” or “does not meet criteria” as to whether the incident meets each criterion for each type of maltreatment.  ISD are made by majority rule.  The Chair breaks ties by voting a second time.  Votes are recorded in the automated decision tree.  Re-voting on an incident will not occur simply because one or more members do not agree  with  the  determination.    However,  if  during  the  voting  process there is confusion on one criterion the FAPA can go back one screen to allow a re-vote on that criterion.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.12.    When  a  CRB  member  has  a  conflict  of  interest,  the  CRB member  will  request  permission  from  the  CRB  Chair  to  abstain  from  voting on that particular case.  If granted, the CRB member would vote on neither A nor B criteria.  When the CRB Chair has a conflict of interest in voting on an incident,  it  is  recommended  that  the  alternate  Chair  oversee  the  meeting  and vote on that particular incident.  This is because the Chair must be available to break a tie.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.13.   CRB members do not have discretion to disregard the criteria in  the  maltreatment  definitions.    The  purpose  of  the  data  collection  is  to consistently  record  the  number  of  maltreatment  incidents  into  the  database.   36 AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 Voting by CRB members that is inconsistent with the criteria in the decision tree will be addressed immediately by the CRB Chair.  Recurring problems of this nature that are not resolved by the Chair should be reported by the FAO to the Family Advocacy Clinical Director at AFMOA.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.14.  Minutes will be generated within 30-days and reflect the CRB ISDs,  and  signed  by  the  CRB  Chair.    The  format  of  minutes  is  standardized across the AF by the FASOR system and will not be modified.  Minutes will be maintained at the FAP for five years, then shredded.  Minutes will refer to clients by incident number, not by name.  Votes will not be printed in minutes.  It is not necessary for the MTF/CC or the MDOS/CC to review or sign CRB minutes.  Clients do not have access to minutes.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.15.   MTF/CC is  the  ISD  reviewer  and therefore will not  serve as an alternate CRB Chair.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.16.   An alleged offender or victim may submit an Incident Status Determination  Review  (ISDR)  request  to  the  FAO  if  at  least  one  of  two criteria  is  met:    1)  the  CRB  determination  was  made  in  error  because  new information that could affect the determination was not available to the CRB at the time of the original determination; or 2) there are concerns about CRB noncompliance  with  published  protocols  and  requirements  (e.g., the automated decision tree).  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.16.1.    The  ISDR  must  be  submitted  within  30  days  of notification of the CRB case status determination.  A copy of the CRB ISD letter should be attached to the request.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.16.2.    When  the  victim  is  a  child,  a  parent  or  legal  guardian, acting on behalf of the child and in the child’s best interest, may request an ISDR.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.16.3.   The FAO and MTF/CC review the request and make their recommendations to the CRB Chair as to whether the request meets criteria for an ISDR.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.16.4.    The  Chair  decides  whether  to  grant  the  review  and  has discretion about whether to review the request if submitted outside 30 days.  The ISDR Process Reviewer observes the CRB for each ISDR.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.16.5.   Neither the ISDR Process Reviewer nor the CRB Chair is subject to interview by the FAP client.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.16.6.    The  client  must  submit  the  ISDR  request  to  the  FAO  at the  installation  where  the  original  case  status  determination  was  made.    A CRB  at  one  installation  cannot  conduct  an  ISDR  of  a  case  determination made by a CRB at another installation.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.16.7.   Changes in the ISD as a result of the ISDR will be noted on the AF  Form 2486 in  the FAP  record.  The new determination must be uploaded into the AF Central Registry.  (T-0).    AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 37 2.2.4.5.1.2.16.8.  Because the MTF/CC is the ISDR Process Reviewer he or she will not serve as an alternate CRB Chair.  The MTF/CC will complete the initial web-based CRB training prior to observing an ISDR.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.17.  Any  CRB  member  who  is  an  alleged  offender  of  child maltreatment or an alleged offender or victim of partner maltreatment must be removed  from  serving  on  the  CRB  until  the  allegation  either:    (1)  does  not meet criteria or; or (2) the met criteria case where CRB member is offender, is closed as resolved.  (T-0). 2.2.4.5.1.2.18.  In  cases  of  death  due  to  suspected  family  maltreatment,  the CRB is required to review the available information about the incident and its impact on the victim(s) and vote on each criterion.  In spite of how difficult it is  to  discuss  such  tragic  outcomes,  homicide  is  the  most  extreme  form  of family  maltreatment  and  must  be  counted  as  such  in  the  Central  Registry database.  (T-0). 2.2.5.  The Clinical Case Staffing (CCS).  The CCS is the forum for clinical management of domestic  abuse  and  child  maltreatment  cases  via  multidisciplinary  review  of  the  current status, plan and recommendation for each new or open domestic abuse or child maltreatment case.  (T-0). 2.2.5.1.  The FAO will chair the CCS. (T-0).  Attendees of the CCS include the FAO and all Family Advocacy Treatment  Managers (FATMs), FAIS, FANs, FAOMs  and Family Advocacy Program Assistants (FAPAs) shall be present unless on leave, or TDY.  (T-1).  The DAVA will attend and participate in those portions of the CCS in which supportive services  and  safety  of  the  victim,  and  any  children  living  in  the  victim’s  home,  are discussed, only sharing information with FAP that the victim has authorized the DAVA to  share;  DAVAs  do  not  attend  those  portions  of  the  CCS  in  which  assessment  and clinical  treatment  for  the  alleged  abuser  are  discussed.    (T-1).      A  MH  Flight  provider, ADAPT  provider,  or  other  medical  providers  who  may  add  value  to  the  clinical  case discussions  must  be  invited  to  the  CCS  at  the  FAO’s  discretion.    (T-1).    CPS representatives will be invited to participate for child maltreatment incidents.  (T-1).  No less  than  two  privileged  providers  will  be  in  attendance.    (T-1).    At  installations  where there is an FAO but no FATM or FAIS, a MH provider will attend CCS in order to meet the  requirement  for  two  privileged  providers.    (T-1).    In  the  absence  of  the  FAO,  the Alternate  FAO  or  a  FATM/FAIS  will  chair  the  CCS.    (T-1).    Whoever  chairs  the  CCS must sign the CCS notes in the FAP record and AHLTA.  (T-0). 2.2.5.2.  Details of client treatment plans, progress, coordination of care with other MTF services, and other HIPAA-protected information are discussed in CCS, not in CRB, and relayed  to  immediate  command  only  when  there  is  a  military  mission-related  need  to know.    Treatment  recommendations  of  the  CCS  will  be  conveyed  to  each  adult  client.  Care  must  be  taken  to  protect  individuals’  personal  health  information.    Therefore, treatment  recommendations  for  the  alleged  offender  cannot  be  shared  with  the  partner and  vice  versa,  without  client  consent.    The  case  manager  will  document  in  the  FAP record  how  and  when  the  recommendations  were  given  to  the  client(s).    The  case manager will follow up with the active component’s CC after the CCS to advise him/her of  the  family’s  level  of  risk  for  further  maltreatment,  level  of  motivation/interest  in  38 AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 services, any prevention or treatment recommendations, will document the consult in the FAP record.  (T-0). 2.2.5.2.1.  (Added)  The  CCS  will  recommend  all  adult  males  who  are  the  alleged offender  in  a  met  criteria  partner  maltreatment  incident  be  referred  to  Change  Step intervention,  which  is  a  domestic  abuse  group  treatment  curriculum  for  adult  males provided  by  FAP  social  workers.    (T-1).    If  the  alleged  offender  is  not  deemed appropriate  for  Change  Step,  justification  will  be  well  documented  and  a  different treatment course will be included in the treatment plan.  (T-1).  Change Step training for FAP social workers is provided by AF FAP annually.  (T-1). 2.2.5.3.  The  CCS  will  review  each  open  record  at  least  quarterly  (child  sexual maltreatment  incidents  monthly).    (T-0).    The  case  manager  will  report  the  client’s progress toward established goals, and current level of risk.  (T-0).  The members of the CCS  will  provide  clinical  consultation  as  needed  in  support  of  the  most  effective intervention course.  (T-0).  Once the ISD is made at the CRB, the case manager will rate the incident severity using the automated Incident Severity Scale (ISS) and document the severity  rating  in  FASOR.    (T-0).    The  incident  will  be  reviewed  at  the  CCS  within  30 days of the CRB determination.  (T-0). 2.2.5.4.  CCS  documentation  in  the  FAP  record:  Incidents  pending  CRB  determination will be documented as initial incidents at all CCS, including the first CCS after the CRB determination. The documentation of the CCS discussion will include: attendance at the CCS,  allegation,  identified  risk  and  protective  factors,  level  of  risk,  victim  and  alleged offender’s  motivation  for  change,  and  interest  in  services,  issues  identified  in  the assessment,  Commander  notification  plan  (phone  call  or  meeting),  incident  status (“Record  Opened,”  “Record  Closed-resolved”  or  “Record  Closed-unresolved”),  and recommendations.    If  no  recommendation  for  services  is  indicated,  the  CCS  note  will state “incident closed, no services recommended.”  The case manager and FAO will sign the  CCS  Note  for  placement  in  the  FAP  record.    When  the  incident  is  reviewed  at  the CCS, FASOR will produce a CCS note for the FAP record.  (T-0). 2.2.5.5.   CCS Documentation in AHLTA:  When the referral is received and the incident is  entered  into  FASOR,  the  CCS  template  will  be  generated  for  documentation  of  the CCS in AHLTA.  The FAPA will enter the agenda items into FASOR and will indicate whether  the  assessed  referrals  will  close  or  remain  open  for  services.    Those  incidents determined  to  be  No  Reasonable  Suspicion  (NRS)  and  No  Assessment  Warranted (NAW) will not require documentation in AHLTA.  FASOR will generate a CCS SF 600 for the medical record of the alleged offender, victim and sponsor.  The FAPA will use the  “Add  Note”  feature  to  “copy  and  paste”  the  initial  CCS  note  into  AHLTA.    The Medical  Record  CCS  note  will  include  the  date  of  CCS  and  incident  number,  action: “Record  Opened,”  “Record  Closed-resolved”  or  “Record  Closed-unresolved”,  services recommended for family members  (e.g., Return to the  FAP  for intervention, referred to prevention  services,  or  no  services  recommended),  and  risk  level.    The  FAO  (or  CCS Chair) will electronically sign the CCS note in AHLTA.  (T-1). 2.2.5.6.    Case  Closure/transfer:    When  the  incident  is  closed  or  transferred  to  another installation,  the  FAPA  will  enter  the  closed/transferred  status  into  FASOR  and  the closure/transferred note for AHLTA will be populated by the case manager and generated  AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 39 for the alleged offender, victim, and sponsor and any other family member who received treatment.   The case manager will use the “Add Note” feature in  AHLTA to  “copy and paste” the closure/transfer notes into AHLTA.  This note will contain: date of CCS and incident number, summary of services received, progress toward goals, action:  “Record Opened,”  “Record  Closed-resolved”  or  “Record  Closed-unresolved”  current  risk  level, recommendations. If the CCS recommended secondary prevention services such as NPSP or FAST, the closure note should state “prevention services recommended.”  The incident status  determination  made  by  the  CRB  will  not  be  placed  in  the  medical  record  of  any FAP client. 2.2.6.  All  documentation  of  clinical  contact  must  be  placed  in  FASOR  or  FAPNet  and printed for the FAP,  FAST or NPSP record.  Maltreatment  face-to-face  contacts  must have corresponding AHLTA records. 2.2.7.   Child Sexual Maltreatment Response Team (CSMRT). 2.2.7.1.    CSMRT  members  are  appointed  in  writing  by  their  CC  and  approved  by  the FAC. Membership includes the FAO, who serves as the Chair, and representatives from OSI and JA.  The CSMRT is activated by the FAO immediately upon receipt of a child sexual abuse allegation and manages the initial response to the allegations.  The CSMRT may also be activated in cases of extra-familial/non-caregiver sexual assault of a minor to ensure OSI and JA are aware of the allegation and that victim safety is assessed.  (T-0). 2.2.7.1.1.   The goal of this CSMRT is to minimize risk and trauma to the victim and family and ensure coordinated decision making and case management.  (T-0). 2.2.7.1.2.   The FAO trains members prior to serving on the CSMRT.  (T-0).  Team activation must be reported to the FAC and documented in the FAC minutes.  (T-0). 2.2.7.1.3.    Under  the  leadership  of  the  FAO,  the  CSMRT  reviews  the  allegation(s) and coordinates a course of action.  (T-0).  This team determines how organizations will  proceed  in  making  required  notifications,  conducting  interviews,  scheduling medical  exams,  arranging  for  the  safety  of  the  victim  and  all  family  members,  and conducting the FAP psychosocial assessments.  (T-0). 2.2.7.1.4.   The FAO ensures documentation of the CSMRT is placed in the victim’s FAP record. (T-0). 2.2.8.   High Risk for Violence Response Team (HRVRT). 2.2.8.1.   The HRVRT will be activated when there is a threat of immediate and serious harm to family members, unmarried intimate partners, or the FAP staff.  (T-0). 2.2.8.1.1.   HRVRT is activated at the discretion of the FAO.  Members are appointed in writing by their CC and approved by the FAC.  Membership includes the FAO, the FAP  clinician  working  with  the  family,  member’s  SQ/CC,  JA,  SFS,  MH  provider, AFOSI, DAVA, and  representatives from other  agencies having legal,  investigative, or protective responsibilities, as appropriate.  (T-0). 2.2.8.1.2.    FAO  trains  members  prior  to  serving  on  the  HRVRT.    Team  activation must be reported to the FAC and documented in the FAC minutes.  (T-0).    40 AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 2.2.8.1.3.   The HRVRT: 2.2.8.1.4.   Addresses safety issues and risk factors.  (T-0). 2.2.8.1.5.   Develops a coordinated plan for immediate implementation to manage risk to the individual presenting the potential threat, the suspected or intended victims and the community at large.  (T-0). 2.2.9.   Maltreatment Intervention. 2.2.9.1.    Logging  Maltreatment  Referrals in  FASOR:  Each  maltreatment referral/allegation  must  be  entered  into  FASOR  as  a  new  incident.    Each  victim  is assigned  an  incident  number.  All  referrals  will  appear  in  FASOR’s  referral  log  in chronological order. FASOR creates the CCS agenda using incident numbers assigned to each  referral.    Therefore,  each  maltreatment  allegation  will  be  presented  to  the  CCS. FASOR also creates the CRB agenda using all incident numbers except NRS, NAW, and Restricted Report referrals.  (T-0). 2.2.9.2.  The FAPA or other FAP staff will receive maltreatment referrals and write them up on the FAP Referral Form.  (T-1).  Since the immediacy of the response is based on the imminence of risk, the adult victim or non-offending caregiver must be contacted as soon  as  possible  to  evaluate  victim  safety,  safety  plan,  and  immediate  needs.    (T-0).  Note, however, DAVAs do not contact child victims directly and may need to wait until after the child victim is interviewed to contact the non-offending caregiver in child cases.  If  a  domestic  abuse  victim  advocate  is  available,  the  victim  advocate  must  contact  the adult victim.  (T-1).  If a victim advocate is not available, the referral will be given to a FAP  provider  as  soon  as  possible,  but  NLT  two  hours  after  receipt.    (T-1).    Referrals indicating  an  emergent  response  is  needed  will  be  immediately  referred  to  law enforcement.  (T-0).  The provider will evaluate the referral  for whether or not it meets the FAP’s reasonable suspicion for maltreatment threshold, whether the victim(s) or the alleged  offender  are  living  in  the  active  component  member’s  household,  and  initial assessment  of  risk/safety  and  the  urgency  of  the  situation  (e.g.,  immediate  need  for clinical, medical, law enforcement, legal or command intervention).  (T-1).  The alleged maltreatment  must  have  occurred  after  the  child’s  birth.    The  FAP  does  not  accept maltreatment referrals on alleged maltreatment of a fetus.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.    The FAO, or designee, will open a FAP maltreatment record when the referral indicates  there  is  reasonable  suspicion  that  domestic  abuse  or  child  maltreatment  has occurred in the home of an active component member, or among members of the active component  member’s  household.    When  domestic  abuse  or  child  maltreatment  occurs among  members  of  the  household  of  an  active  component  member  and  an  intimate partner where one or both is active component (i.e., a current or former spouse; a person with whom the victim shares a child in common; a person with whom the victim shares or  has  shared  a  common  domicile,  or  a  person  with  whom  the  victim  is  dating  and  is (was) engaged in a sexually intimate relationship or there is a demonstrated potential for an  ongoing  relationship),  a  FAP  provider  will  assess  the  active  component  member, assess  the  intimate  partner  and  all  children,  provide  safety  planning,  and  refer  non-beneficiaries to local resources for any needed services.  (T-0).  AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 41 2.2.9.3.1.   The FAP manages sexual assault allegations when the alleged offender is the  partner  in  context  of  a  spousal  relationship,  same  sex  domestic  partnership, unmarried  intimate  partner  relationship,  or  military  dependents  who  are  17  years  of age and  younger.   (T-0).  If any of the following four indicators are met, the sexual assault is considered intimate partner violence and will be referred to the FAP. 2.2.9.3.1.1.   The victim is or has been married to the alleged offender.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.1.2.    The  victim  and  alleged  offender  have  a  child  or  children  together.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.1.3.   The victim lives or has lived with the alleged offender and is (was) engaged  in  a  sexually  intimate  relationship  (i.e.,  couple  engaged  in  sexual intercourse or other sexual acts in the course of a romantic relationship).  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.1.4.    The  victim  is  a  military  dependent  17  years  of  age  and  younger (excludes Service members that are 17 years old).  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.2.   The SARC and installation FAP provider will discuss SAPR referrals that fall  under  paragraph  2.2.9.3.3.1,  to  assess  for  the  potential  for  ongoing  violence within 24 hours of the victim reporting the incident to the SARC. 2.2.9.3.3.  If a potential for ongoing violence exists the SARC and FAP will explain to the victim that this risk requires the case be referred to FAP.  The SARC and FAP will  also  ensure  the  victim  is  immediately  aware  of  all  services  available  to  help him(her) and understands the concept of informed consent that enables the victim to include  anyone  (for  example,  an  SVC,  friend,  family  member,  co-worker,  chaplain) they  choose  in  appointments  regarding  their  assault.    Note,  however,  that  only communications with an SVC or chaplain are privileged and protected by law.  The SARC  and  FAP  will  ensure  the  victim  understands  that    he(she)  can  adjust/modify his(her)  consent  to  these  participants  as  he(she)  feels  necessary/  comfortable throughout  the  process  without  the  fear  of  losing  access  or  support  from  any supporting entity. 2.2.9.3.3.1.   The  following  cases that initially  report to  SAPR personnel  will be referred to FAP for services: 2.2.9.3.3.1.1.    If  the  victim  is  in  an  ongoing  relationship  with  the  alleged offender and prior to the incident they engaged in sexual intercourse or other sexual acts in the course of a romantic relationship or there is a demonstrated potential for an ongoing relationship. 2.2.9.3.3.1.2.    If  the  alleged  offender  has  engaged  or  is  engaging  in  stalking behaviors  (e.g.,  including  but  not  limited  to,  showing  up  in  places  that  are otherwise  not  expected  that  the  victim  is  at,  following  the  victim,  texting, calling,  contacting  friends,  co-workers  or  family,  driving  by  a  residence  or work,  Global  Positioning  System  tracking,  social  networking  tracking, tracking  whereabouts friends  or  co-workers,  bullying  and manipulation). through    42 AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 2.2.9.3.3.2.   The SARC will only enter the case into the Defense Sexual Assault Incident  Database  when  FAP  is  not  taking  the  sexual  assault  incident  to  the Central Registry Board to avoid a double count of sexual assault cases. 2.2.9.3.3.3.   If the victim chooses not to engage in FAP services, the victim can choose SARC services but the CMG must be informed of the safety risks with the victim and ensure a safety plan is coordinated by the SARC with the victim. 2.2.9.3.4.    The  FAP  will  log  the  case  as  an  unmarried  intimate  partner  case,  child abuse case, or sexual assault of a minor, and assess the client, offer safety planning, and when indicated take the incident to the CRB.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.5.    The  FAP  providers  will  open  a  maltreatment  case  when  there  is  an allegation  of  sexual  maltreatment  of  a  child  by  a  caretaker  in  a  DOD-sanctioned activity  or  sexual  maltreatment  of  a  child  by  a  member  of  the  active  component member’s household who is a caretaker or in a position of power over the child.  (See Attachment 1, Terms and Definitions: Position of Power, Household Member.)  The FAP  providers  do  not  conduct  investigative  interviews  with  extra-familial  alleged offenders-(e.g., Child Development Center (CDC) employees, Youth Center childcare providers,  Youth  Center  Coach,  neighbor).    SF  or  OSI  conducts  investigative interviews.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.6.   When an incident  of physical  or emotional child maltreatment  or neglect occurs  in  a  DOD-sanctioned  activity,  including  DODEA  schools,  the  FAP  provider will notify Child Protective Services, SFS, and OSI, to conduct the investigation.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.6.1.    The  FAP  will  open  a  maltreatment  record  when  DOD-sanctioned caregivers,  including  DODEA  personnel,  are  accused  of  child  maltreatment  and will take the allegation to the CRB. The FAP provider will notify the family of the maltreatment allegation, and of the notifications made by the FAP, and will offer to assess the victim and conduct non-offending parent intake interviews with the parents.  FAP services will be offered to the victim and family members who are eligible beneficiaries, upon their request.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.6.2.    The  FAP  provider  will  serve  as  consultant  to  the  DOD/DODEA personnel involved and attempt to secure updates for them regarding the status of any CPS or military law enforcement investigations.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.6.3.    When  employees  are  performing  DOD-sanctioned  childcare activities,  or  teaching  in  DODEA,  they  must  comply  with  DOD  positive  child guidance  and  supervision  policies.    For  example,  physical  discipline  is  an infraction  of  AF  Child  Development/Youth  Center  and  DODEA  positive guidance policy.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.6.4.    However,  a  referral  to  the  FAP  is  only  necessary  if  there  is  a suspicion  of  abuse  or  neglect.    If  reasonable  suspicion  of  maltreatment  is established  by  the  FAP  provider,  the  FAP  will  initiate  the  notification  protocols and take the allegation to the CRB.  The DODEA principal will attend CRB as a non-voting  member  when  an  incident  involving  a  DODEA  employee  is  being presented.  If reasonable suspicion is not established, the FAP provider will serve  AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 43 as  a  consultant  to  the  Child  Development  Center/Youth  Center  Director  or DODEA  principal  to  help  him/her  identify  what  incidents  should  be  handled administratively as a breach of policy.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.6.5.   The FAP providers will advocate for law enforcement investigation of  child  maltreatment  allegations  and  serve  as  liaison  between  military  law enforcement and DOD/DODEA personnel.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.7.   The FAP provider will consult JA prior to opening a maltreatment case on a  GS  or  Contract  employee  in  an  OCONUS  location  (including  U.S.  Territories).  When risk for maltreatment is high, the FAP provider will notify installation leaders to address safety concerns with non-active component OCONUS families.  The FAP will offer voluntary services to these families.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.8.    If  a  military  beneficiary  child  is  assaulted  or  endangered  by  someone outside  the  family  or  household  (non-DoD-sanctioned),  a  maltreatment  record  will not  be  opened.    However,  mental  health  or  the  FAP  providers  will  offer  crisis intervention  counseling  and  if  the  child  or  military  beneficiary  parent  is  requesting ongoing counseling services, the FAP provider will open a FAST Services record to serve the victim and family and will engage the DAVA when appropriate to support the non-offending parents.  All sexual assaults involving children 17 and younger and all  sexual  assaults  involving  spouses  or  unmarried  intimate  partners  are  reported directly to the FAP for risk assessment and safety planning.  All other sexual assaults are reported to the installation SARC or SAPR VA.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.9.   Sexual assault between spouses or unmarried intimate partner is domestic abuse and will be managed by the FAP.  Once the FAP assumes case management of domestic abuse sexual assault cases, no information about the case is shared with the SARC or at the Case Management Group (CMG) without the client’s consent.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.10.    Expedited  Transfer  (ET)  for  FAP  domestic  abuse  victims,  unmarried intimate partner sexual abuse victims, and victims as defined by 2.2.9.3.3.1.1., supra.  ET  provides  active  component  victims  who  file  an  unrestricted  report  of  partner sexual abuse (UCMJ Articles 120, 120a and 120c) the option of a permanent change of station or a temporary or permanent change of assignment (PCA) to a location that will  assist  with  the  immediate  and  future  welfare  of  the  victim,  while  also  allowing them  to  move  to  locations  that  can  offer  additional  support  to  assist  with  healing, recovery, and rehabilitation.  One ET may be facilitated for an unrestricted report of partner sexual abuse.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.10.1.    When  an  unrestricted  report  of  partner  sexual  abuse  is  filed  with FAP by an active component victim, the victim shall be informed of the expedited transfer  process  option  by  the  FAP  provider,  DAVA,  SVC  or  the  victim’s commander  (or  equivalent),  at  the  time  of  the  initial  report,  or  as  soon  as practicable.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.10.2.  ET requests will be initiated by the victim with the FAP provider or DAVA, and facilitated by the SARC or SAPR VA and squadron commander (or equivalent) IAW the ET request process outlined in AFI 90-6001, Sexual Assault Prevention  and  Response  (SAPR)  Program,  Chapter  11.    (T-0).    If  the  victim  44 AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 requests an ET, the FAP provider or DAVA will advise the victim that a release of  information  form  must  be  signed  first  to  initiate  the  ET  process.    Only information  that  is  relevant  to  the  justification  of  the  ET  will  be  shared  by  FAP with  the  SARC  and  SAPR  VA.    A  CMG  meeting  may  be  requested  by  the commander to inform the ET decision.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.10.2.1.    The  release  of  information  form  must  also  include  the possibility  that  the  installation  or  host  WG/CC  or  victim’s  unit  CC  may request  consultation  from  the  SAPR  Case  Management  Group  (CMG)  when determining whether to grant the ET request.  The release form at a minimum will  include:    “Only  relevant  information  will  be  shared  with  the  SARC and SAPR  VA  at  this  installation  relevant  to  the  justification  of  the  ET  request.  Relevant  information  will  also  be  shared,  if  requested,  with  the  SAPR  Case Management  Group  with  oversight  from  the  Wing/CC  or  victim’s  unit  CC when determining whether to grant the ET.” 2.2.9.3.10.2.2.   If convened, the FAP provider and/or DAVA must attend the CMG  specifically  for  the  purpose  of  sharing  relevant  information  about  the partner  sexual  abuse  and  its  impact  on  the  victim  to  inform  the  decision  to grant the victim’s ET request. 2.2.9.3.10.2.3.    The  FAP  provider  or  DAVA  will  advise  the  victim  that  the ET  request  and  approval/denial  process  will  be  complete  within  72  hours  of initiating the ET request. 2.2.9.3.10.2.4.    The  victim  may  request  an  ET  prior  to  the  Central  Registry Board  determination  on  the  alleged  incident.    A  presumption  shall  be established  in  favor  of  transferring  an  active  component  member  (who initiated the transfer request) following a credible report of sexual assault.  (T-0).    The  commander  (or  equivalent),  or  the  appropriate  approving  authority, shall make a credible report determination at the time the expedited request is made after  considering the advice of the supporting judge  advocate, or other legal  advisor  concerned,  and  the  available  evidence  based  on  an  Military Criminal Investigation Office investigation’s information (if available).  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.10.3.  The installation or host WG/CC shall consider potential transfer of the active component alleged offender instead of the victim if appropriate.  (T-0).  Alleged offender reassignments are handled IAW AFI 36-2110, Assignments.  (T-1).  This requirement may be delegated to the WG/CV but not further.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.10.4.  Once an ET has been approved, the change of assignment is handled IAW established Air Force regulation AFI 36-2110, Assignments.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.11.  Each  allegation  of  domestic  abuse  or  child  maltreatment  will  receive  an immediate  risk  assessment  followed  by  individual  psychosocial  assessments  with each family member, or unmarried intimate partner.  (T-0).  Family members will be evaluated  for  all  types  of  maltreatment  witnessed  or  experienced  as  well  as  any service  needs.    (T-0).    Each  family  member  will  be  interviewed  separately,  at  least initially.  (T-0).  The assessment process involves interviewing family members and collecting information from records, background checks, and collateral contacts with  AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 45 other  involved  agencies.    The  FAP  clinician  will  collect  information  listed  on  the FASOR Adult  and Child  Intake Assessment.   (T-1).  These automated SF 600s will be  filed  in  the  FAP  record.    (T-1).    The  Intimate  Partner  Physical  Injury  Risk Assessment  Tool  (IPPI-RAT)  will  be  completed  and  scored  for  each  allegation  of adult partner maltreatment and filed in the FAP record.  (T-0).  A young child will be assessed for his/her developmental ability to give a valid interview. (T-1). The child will  be  interviewed  using  the  National  Institute  of  Child  Health  and  Development (NICHD)  Research  Based  Structured  Child  Interview,  if  the  case  manager  has  been trained in that protocol.  (T-1).  If civilian family members refuse to participate in the FAP  assessment  or  if  parents  refuse  to  allow  their  children  to  participate,  the  FAP provider  will  document  the  refusal  and  all  efforts  to  obtain  these  interviews  in  the FAP record.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.12.   Any injury to an infant will be considered serious.  When parents refuse to have an infant with injuries medically evaluated, the FAP provider will notify CPS, the  active  component  member’s  commander,  and  the  FAP  provider’s  chain  of command.    When  an  infant,  age  birth  to  24  months,  presents  with  a  serious  or unexplained injury, the FAP provider will recommend to the attending physician that a  skeletal  survey  be  conducted  to  look  for  any  past  injuries.    In  situations  where symptoms  indicate  a  possible  head  injury,  a  CT  scan  of  the  head  will  also  be recommended by the FAP provider.  Should the physician refuse to order the x-rays, the FAP provider will elevate the recommendation to the SGH.  It may also be helpful to consult the AF Child Abuse Pediatrician for her/his recommendation.  If the infant has siblings under the age of 3 years, the FAP provider will also strongly recommend that those siblings undergo a physical exam to rule out non-accidental injuries.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.12.1.    When  maltreatment  allegations,  either  child  or  partner,  involve  a family  with  a  child  under  age  1  year  in  the  home,  a  home  visit  by  a  FAP  case manager is  required.  The case manager will  arrange the home visit  by  advising the  parents  of  the  home  visit  requirement  and  securing  an  invitation  to  the residence.    The  assessment  of  the  home  environment  will  include  at  least, assessment of adequate sleep space, infant formula, food and diapers, child safety issues,  and  child’s  physical  condition  (any  sign  of  failure  to  thrive).    The  case manager  will  also  verify the  infant  is  receiving  well  baby  visits  and immunizations.  In addition, weekly contact with the infant will be accomplished by the FAP provider until a case status determination is made.  If CPS visits the home, the child is seen by a doctor, or the child attends DOD-sponsored day care, the  case  manager  may  contact  the  CPS  worker,  doctor,  or  daycare  provider  to verify  the  condition  of  the  child  in  lieu  of  a  contact  that  week.    This  will  be documented  in  the  FAP  record.    If  the  child  is  injured,  it  is  appropriate  for continuity  of  care  to  contact  the  child’s  Primary  Care  Manager  (PCM)  or pediatrician  to  inform  him/her  of  the  injury  and  inquire  about  any  past  injuries.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.12.1.1.   The FAP accepts referrals of suspected child neglect that are related to a condition called FTT.  Typically, FTT referrals are received from the pediatrician or pediatric nurse practitioner.  FTT is  a physical  sign that a child is not receiving adequate nutrition for optimal growth and development.   46 AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 An  infant  or  child  becoming  malnourished  as  the  result  of  parental  or caregiver neglect creates concern for child maltreatment. 2.2.9.3.13.    If the incident  meets  criteria for maltreatment,  an intervention plan will be developed with the family within 30 days of the clients’ engagement in treatment.  Regardless of incident status, clinical recommendations and appropriate referrals will be made to address any needs identified in the assessment process.  Moderate to high risk families in OCONUS locations who refuse to participate in the FAP assessments or  recommended  treatment  should  be  strongly  considered  for  command  directed humanitarian  relocation  to  promote  victim  safety  and  to  establish  an  effective  FAP intervention  plan,  and  will  collaborate  with  state  child  protective  services  for  child cases.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.14.   The FAP provider will assign a risk level (low, moderate or high) to each victim and offender of family maltreatment based on all of the available information about  the  incident  and  the  family.    Individuals  deemed  at  high  risk  for  continued abuse or neglect will be placed on the MH Flight High Interest  Log.  The FAO will consider activating the HRVRT in high risk situations.  Law enforcement, emergency personnel, and CC/CCF are responsible for managing acute situations where there is risk  to  the  safety  of  a  military  member,  family  member,  or  unmarried  intimate partner.  Unit CC/CCF, SF, JA, and other authoritative agencies will be consulted, as required, in making necessary protective interventions.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.15.   The FAP staff will not accompany command or emergency personnel to unsecured home environments in emergent situations.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.16.    Intervention  and  safety  plans  will  be  developed  to  ensure  the  safety  of victims  and/or  potential  victims,  alleged  offenders,  and  other  family  members.    In developing  the  intervention  plan,  primary  and  secondary  prevention  programs  will not  be  used  in  lieu  of  treatment.    However,  when  needs  for  education  and/or  skill building are identified the provider will discuss available options (e.g., books, classes, individual  instruction,  videos,  the  internet)  and  clients  choose  how  they  will  obtain the information.  Application of the new information/skills will be integrated into the required treatment sessions (weekly to monthly) with the FAP provider.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.17.  All the FAP maltreatment clients who are receiving treatment from a FAP provider  must  have  a  FASOR-generated  intervention  plan  developed  with  the  FAP provider  and  placed  in  the  FAP  maltreatment  record  within  30  days  of  the  first follow-up  session  after  intake.    The  FAP  Intervention  Plan  for  maltreatment  or  the FAST  Services  Intervention  Plan  must  include  at  least  the  following:  statement  for each identified problem and specific goal statement for each identified problem.  The intervention statement will include type of intervention, when it will occur, who will be  involved  and  length  of  intervention,  measurable  outcome(s),  documentation regarding the participation of the FAP provider and client(s) with the development of the plan(s), signatures of client(s) and the FAP provider on original and updated plans and criteria for completion of plan.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.18.    The  FAP  provider  will  contact  active  component  member’s  command weekly  for  all  high  risk  clients.    The  FAP  provider  will  contact  high  risk  alleged offenders and victims at least once per week.  Ongoing contact with the command of  AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 47 the sponsor is needed to ensure there is a coordinated community response to the risk in  the  case.    When  lowering  the  level  of  risk  the  FAP  provider  will  consult  with his/her clinical supervisor on the decision to lower the risk, and document the consult and the basis for that decision in the FAP record.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.19.  Suicide  Risk  Assessment,  Management,  and  Treatment  for  the  FAP clients:  The FAP providers will implement clinical guidelines for managing suicidal patients  IAW  AFI  90-505,  Suicide  Prevention  Program,  under  the  Air  Force  Guide for Suicide Risk  Assessment, Management and  Treatment  with  one exception noted under paragraph 2.2.9.3.19.1.3.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.19.1.  At the  Patient  Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the FAP provider will check the PHQ-9 score and responses to each item prior to meeting with the client.  (T-1). the  FAPA  will  administer intake 2.2.9.3.19.1.1.    If  the  client  scores  a  1,  2  or  3  on  the  PHQ  item  #9,  or  the provider  collects  collateral  information  indicating  suicide  risk,  the  provider will conduct a comprehensive suicide risk assessment which includes usage of the Suicide Status Form (SSF-II-R).  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.19.1.2.   The PHQ-9 and the SSF-II-R as well as the Suicide Tracking Form  are  posted  on  FAPNet  in  the  Outputs  and  Data  section  of  the  FASOR home page for the FAP providers to print and utilize.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.19.1.3.   The  FAP providers will monitor the FAP  client’s well-being at  each  visit  using  the  Outcome  Rating  Scale  (ORS)  rather  than  subsequent administrations  of  the  PHQ-9.    When  ORS  scores  are  low  and  collateral information  indicates  the  client’s  possible  risk  for  suicide,  the  provider  will conduct a comprehensive suicide risk assessment. 2.2.9.3.19.2.  The  FAP  provider  will  manage  the  FAP  clients  with  suicidal ideation IAW the above mentioned AF guide.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.20.    Clinical  assessment  and  treatment  for  family  members  identified  as  at risk  for,  or  referred  for  suspected  domestic  abuse  or  child  maltreatment,  will  be provided solely by licensed, privileged MH  Flight  providers, including  OSD-funded FAP  treatment  staff.    If  more  than  one  MH  Flight  provider  is  serving  a  client,  the client’s  case  will  be  staffed  at  the  Multidisciplinary  Clinical  Case  Conference (MCCC).  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.20.1.   Master’s or doctoral-level providers not yet independently licensed and  working  toward  privileged  status  may  treat  the  FAP  clients  under  the  direct supervision of a trained, privileged FAP provider.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.20.2.   Where the MTF does not have suitable providers in place to treat a FAP client, the client may be referred to a TRICARE network provider so long as there is case management by the FAP provider and the client signs authorization to  release  treatment  progress  updates  to  the  FAP  provider  overseeing  the  case.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.21.    The  FAP  provider  will  have  at  least  monthly  face-to-face  contact  with alleged  maltreatment  offenders  who  have  open  maltreatment  cases.    If  the  required  48 AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 contact  is  not  possible, the FAP  provider must document all efforts to  make contact with the alleged offender.  Frequency of client contact will increase as risk increases.  When  maltreatment  victims  are  not  engaged  in  services  in  the  FAP  office,  the  FAP providers will establish a way to monitor whether re-abuse is occurring as part of the victim’s  safety  plan.    This  may  include  face-to-face,  telephonic,  or  other  means  of monitoring  victim  safety  (e.g.,  talking  with  the  non-offending  protective  parent  of  a child victim).  Victims should be interviewed separately from their alleged offenders when  ongoing  contact  with  victims  is  for  the  purpose  of  determining  whether  the maltreatment  is  continuing,  decreasing,  or  increasing.    The  FAP  provider  will  have regular contact with the Commander or First Sergeant who has an active component member with an open maltreatment case.  When alleged offenders and/or victims are fully  participating  in  intervention  plans  and  abuse  is  not  re-occurring,  quarterly updates from the FAP provider to the CC/CCF are appropriate.  As risk increases, so should contact between the FAP provider and the CC/CCF.  (T-0). request  assistance. 2.2.9.3.22.    When  active  component  alleged  offenders  are  non-compliant  with treatment recommendations, the FAP provider will promptly notify the member’s CC to treatment recommendations  should  be  well  documented  in  the  FAP  record.    When  such problems  arise  the  CCS  will  review  the  case  and  when  safety  is  a  concern,  may request assistance from the FAC Chair.  (T-0).   CC/CCF refusal to  support the  FAP 2.2.9.3.23.    FAP  maltreatment  records  will  remain  open  as  long  as  a  military beneficiary child in is foster care unless the parental rights have been removed by the courts.    When  the  child  is  in  the  parent’s  care,  FAP  will  monitor  the  child’s  safety until  state  CPS  closes  their  record.    Reasons  for  variance  from  this  policy  must  be documented in CCS minutes. 2.2.9.3.24.    When  unsanitary  living  conditions  are  discovered  in  a  military  family home,  a  minimum  of  six  months  of  monthly  no-notice  home  inspections  will  be conducted by CCF and/or by CPS/FAP to ensure sanitary conditions are maintained.  Successful  completion  of  FAP  intervention  plan would  require  compliance  with  no-notice inspections. 2.2.9.3.25.    DAVA:    DAVAs  provide  24/7  non-clinical  assistance  and  support  to victims  of  domestic  abuse  and  intimate  partner  sexual  assaults.    Where  no  military DAVA  is  available,  victims  will  be  referred  to  civilian  DAVA  services.    All  adult victims  referred  to  the  FAP  will  have  access  to  immediate  and  ongoing  DAVA support  services,  including,  crisis  intervention,  safety  planning,  court/medical accompaniment,  and information and referrals.   DAVAs work  closely  with  the FAP providers to maintain effective safety plans and empower domestic abuse victims.  At the  discretion  of  the  FAO  and  the  FAP  provider,  the  DAVA  may  also  provide emotional  support  and  information  and  referral  services  to  the  non-offending  parent in a child maltreatment or youth sexual assault case.  (T-0).    AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 49 2.2.9.3.26.    Information  and  referral  to  the  VWAP  is  provided  to  victims  IAW Chapter 7, AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice, and local JA policy. 2.2.9.3.27.  Domestic  Abuse  Reporting  Options.    Adult  victims  of  domestic  abuse have  two  reporting  options:    Unrestricted  Reporting  (UR)  and  Restricted  Reporting (RR).    All  reports  of  maltreatment  are  considered  unrestricted  unless  they  meet criteria for RR and the victim requests RR after options are presented by a qualified authority  (e.g.,  medical  provider,  DAVA).    Regardless  of  whether  the  victim  elects restricted  or  unrestricted  reporting,  confidentiality  of  medical  information  will  be maintained IAW provisions of HIPAA.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.27.1.    Unrestricted  Reporting  for  Domestic  Abuse.    UR  is  a  process allowing  a  victim  of  domestic  abuse  to  report  an  incident  using  chain  of command, law enforcement or OSI and the FAP for clinical intervention.  Victims of  domestic  abuse  who  choose  to  pursue  an  official  command  or  criminal investigation of an incident should use these reporting channels.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.27.1.1.   At the victim’s request, the medical provider, in coordination with  criminal  investigators,  will  conduct  a  forensic  medical  examination.  Details  regarding  the  incident  will  be  limited  to  only  those  personnel  who have a legitimate need to know.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.27.1.2.  All  assessment  and  treatment  services  for  an  UR  of  domestic abuse  will  be  managed  IAW  DODI  6400.06  and  this  instruction,  using command  and  law  enforcement  resources  as  needed  to  enforce  safety  plans and monitor family well-being until the case is closed.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.27.2.    Restricted  Reporting  (RR)  for  Domestic  Abuse.    RR  is  a  process allowing  an  adult  victim  of  domestic  abuse,  who  is  eligible  to  receive  military medical  treatment  the  option  of  reporting  an  incident  of  domestic  abuse  to specified  individuals  for  the  purpose  of  receiving  medical  care,  supportive services,  and/or  advocacy  and  information  without  initiating  the  investigative process or notification to the victim’s or alleged offender’s CC.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.27.2.1.    When  an  adult  victim  elects  RR,  and  discloses  an  abuse allegation to a DAVA, the FAP staff member or any MTF healthcare provider, the domestic abuse allegation may not be disclosed to command or civilian or military  investigative  or  law  enforcement  agencies  except  as  provided  in  the exceptions  to  the  DOD  Domestic  Abuse  Restricted  Reporting  policy  or mandated by state law.  See DODI 6400.06, Domestic Abuse Involving DOD Military  and  Certain  Affiliated  Personnel,  August  21,  2007,  Enclosure  3. http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/640006p.pdf.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.27.2.2.    The  FAP  staff  consults  with  the  appropriate  legal  office  as needed,  to  ensure  appropriate  offering  and  management  of  restricted  reports.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.27.3.    For  purposes  of  command  responsibility  and  in  the  interest  of gathering accurate data,  information  concerning  RRs of domestic abuse,  without personal identifiers, will be reported by the FAO at the next FAC meeting.  This will  inform  installation  leadership  as  to  the  number  and  type  of  domestic  abuse  50 AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 incidents  within  the  command  and  enhance  the  CC’s  ability  to  provide  a  safe environment.    If  the  installation  leadership  wants  to  be  notified  sooner  than  the next FAC, the FAO will supply the required information as requested.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.27.4.  The  medical  provider  will  initiate  appropriate  care  and  treatment and will report the domestic abuse only to a DAVA or the FAP.  At the victim’s request,  the  medical  provider  will  conduct/arrange  any  forensic  medical examination  deemed  appropriate.    The  forensic  component  includes  gathering information  from  the  victim  for  the  medical  forensic  history,  an  examination, documentation  of  biological  and  physical  findings,  collection  of  evidence  from the  victim,  and  follow-up,  as  needed,  to  document  additional  evidence.    The medical provider will transfer the forensic evidence, via proper evidence chain of custody  procedures,  to  an  OSI  agent  using  a  control  number  in  lieu  of  personal identifying information.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.27.5.    All  RRs  that  have  physical  evidence  associated  with  them  will  be assigned  a  Restricted  Report  Control  Number  (RRCN)  by  a  FAP  provider.    The RRCN  will  be  developed  using  a  two-digit  year,  two-digit  month,  the  first  four letters of the installation name, a three-digit numerical sequence, and followed by “R-FAP.”    For  example,  “0709RAND001R  FAP”  represents  the  incidence occurred in 2007, during September, at JBSA Randolph, is the first report of this sequence, and is a restricted report.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.27.6.    DAVAs  or  the  FAP  providers  have  no  responsibility  for  the collection of physical evidence when a restricted report has been made.  DAVAs or  the  FAP  providers  will  not  collect  or  receive  physical  evidence  of  domestic violence from a victim.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.27.7.   The local  OSI detachment is  responsible for taking  custody of the physical  evidence from healthcare personnel and will log, store and preserve the evidence IAW OSI procedures.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.27.8.  If  prior  to  the  one-year  anniversary  date  a  victim  changes  the reporting preference to an unrestricted report, the FAP shall notify the OSI, who shall then process the physical evidence IAW OSI procedures.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.27.9.   The FAP will notify the victim 30 days prior to the expiration of the one-year  evidence  storage  period.    The  FAP  will  appropriately  document  the efforts  to  obtain  a  decision  from  the  victim  or  efforts  to  locate  the  victim.    The FAP  is  authorized  to  complete  any  documentation  required  from  OSI  for  the destruction of evidence on behalf of the victim.  The evidence will be destroyed at the one-year anniversary date unless: 2.2.9.3.27.9.1.   The victim decides to make an unrestricted report. 2.2.9.3.27.9.2.   The victim does not request the return of any personal effects or clothing maintained as part of the collection of evidence. 2.2.9.3.27.9.3.  The victim does not advise the FAP of his or her decision after being notified of the upcoming one-year anniversary. 2.2.9.3.27.9.4.   The victim cannot be located.  (T-1).  AFI40-301  16 NOVEMBER 2015 51 2.2.9.3.27.10.  Due to prohibitions on clinical intervention of pedophiles, the FAP providers  (active  component,  civil  service  and/or  contract)  will  not  provide clinical intervention to sexual offenders to modify deviant sexual arousal patterns.  These  clients  will  be  referred  for  such  clinical  intervention  to  specialists  in  the community.    The  FAP  and  MTF  personnel  may  provide  other  services  to  sex offenders as long as services do not focus on deviant arousal patterns.  (T-1). 2.2.9.3.28.    The  Air  Force  Domestic  Violence  and  Child  Maltreatment  Fatality Review Board (FRB). 2.2.9.3.28.1.   The FRB will convene annually to review fatalities and develop the annual  report  for  submission  to  ODUSD  (P&R/MC&FP)  IAW  DODI  6400.06.  (T-0). 2.2.9.3.28.2.
