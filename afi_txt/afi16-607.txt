Background. 1.1.1.  Conducting  a  CP-interdiction  operation.  CP-interdiction  is  a  proactive  U.S. government  mission  for  deterring,  making  more  costly,  inhibiting,  disrupting,  and preventing trafficking in shipments of proliferation concern.  CP-interdiction consists of stopping proliferation to and by states and non-state actors of proliferation concern.  CP-interdictions  are  usually  conducted  IAW  a  Secretary  of  Defense  (SECDEF)-approved, CP-interdiction  EXORD.    The  Services  support  interagency  and  Combatant  Command (CCMD)  execution  of  CP-interdiction  operations  to  prevent  shipments  of  concern.    Air Force  support  is  focused  primarily  on  air  shipments.    CJCSI  5113.03  provides  general and specific guidance for air counterproliferation interdiction (ACPI) operations.  It also contains definitions of CP-related terms and concepts.   1.1.2.  Security  cooperation  activities  with  Proliferation  Security  Initiative  (PSI) endorsing states to improve capabilities to conduct CP-interdiction operations.  The PSI  is  a  global,  multinational  effort  aiming  to  stop  the  trafficking  of  weapons  of  mass destruction (WMD), their delivery systems, and related materials to and from states and non-state  actors  of  proliferation  concern.    DOD  support  to  PSI  was  established  IAW Secretary  of  Defense  Memorandum  on  U.S.  Military  Support  to  the  Multinational Proliferation Security  Initiative (PSI) Exercise Program  and Related Training, 8  August 2005 and DODD 2060.02, Department of Defense (DOD) Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Policy.  The U.S. participates in security cooperation with other PSI endorsing states to improve national capabilities to interdict WMD, delivery systems, and related material.  Such security cooperation activities may include planning and execution of  PSI  exercises,  games,  related  training,  meetings,  and  conferences.  CJCSI  3520.02B tasks  the  Joint  Staff,  the  Geographic  Combatant  Commands  (GCCs),  U.S.  Strategic Command  (USSTRATCOM),  U.S.  Transportation  Command,  and  the  Services  to participate in the execution of PSI, including operational, exercise, and training activities.

Counterproliferationâ€•â€”Those  actions  taken  to  defeat  the  threat  and/or  use  of  weapons  of mass destruction against the United States, our forces, allies, and partners. AFI16-607  25 MARCH 2016 7 Nonproliferationâ€•â€”Those  actions  (diplomacy,  arms  control,  multilateral  agreements,  threat reduction assistance, and export controls) taken to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  by  dissuading  or  impeding  access  to,  or  distribution  of,  sensitive  technologies, material, and expertise. Operational  Experts  Groupâ€•  â€”The  OEG  sets  the  strategic  direction  for  PSI  and  is responsible  for  outreach  within  PSI,  as  well  as  to  potential  endorsing  states,  international organizations, industry, civil society, and the public.  The OEG convenes annual, action-oriented meetings to address all of the diplomatic, law enforcement, and military elements associated with interdiction  activities.    States  become  OEG  members  based  on  their  political  importance, involvement  in  international  shipping,  or  the  strength  of  their  commitment  to  nonproliferation norms.  They are leaders in their respective regions in preventing the proliferation of WMD and their means of delivery.  Regional OEG members should be invited to all PSI exercises in their region and can provide a depth and breadth of interdiction experience to enrich these activities.  OSD(P) heads the U.S. delegation to the OEG.  Currently, 21 PSI-endorsing states comprise the OEG.    Strong  roles  for  OEG  nations  at  PSI  activities  also  assist  in  preventing  an  overly prominent U.S. role and highlight the truly multilateral nature of PSI. Performance  Indicatorsâ€•â€”Quantitative and qualitative means of assessment that provide an agency the means by which it can internally monitor and evaluate its own efforts to identify areas needing  improvement  and  assessing  the  quality  of  performance  of  ongoing  and  completed activities over time. Proliferation Networkâ€•â€”A proliferation network includes the relational connections made by proliferators, brokers, front companies, and end-users to transport proliferation-related shipments from a source country to the end-user without being detected. (CJCSI 5113.03). PSI  Exercisesâ€•â€”There  are  two  types  of  PSI  exercises:  Stand-Alone  PSI  Exercises  and  PSI Exercise Injects.  Mission permitting, combatant commanders should be prepared to support both types of exercises.  A Stand-Alone PSI Exercise features PSI and CP-interdiction as the central focus of the Exercise and may include Field Training Exercise (FTX), Tabletop Exercise (TTX), or other components and may involve the maritime, air, and/or overland  transport domains.  A PSI Exercise Inject involves a PSI or CP-interdiction scenario that is contained within a broader exercise, such as the CP-interdiction scenarios that are routinely included in the USSOUTHCOM exercise  PANAMAX.    Other  PSI-related  events  include  OEG  meetings,  PSI  key  industry workshops, and discussions at such fora as think tanks and seminars. Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction  (WMD)â€•â€”Chemical,  biological,  radiological,  or  nuclear weapons  capable  of  a  high  order  of  destruction  or  causing  mass  casualties,  but  excluding  the means  of  transporting  or  propelling  the  weapon  where  such  means  is  a  separable  and  divisible part from the weapon. WMD  Delivery  Systemsâ€•â€”Equipment, material, and related technologies usable for systems capable of delivering WMD. WMD  Related  Materialsâ€•â€”Technical  expertise,  materials,  and  sophisticated  dual-use technology that can be used in the development of WMD.
