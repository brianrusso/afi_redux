The AF Form 1613 generated by that verification is filed in the MPRGp in ARMS.    If  the  member  does  not  agree  with  the  service  dates  as  a  result  of  the  18-year verification,  the  member  will  forward  a  request  to  HQ  AFPC/DPSIPV  for  service  date verification. 1.4.  Computing  Service  Dates.  HQ  AFPC  and  HQ  ARPC  compute  service  dates.    Table  1.3 shows  the  service  that  may  be  credited  when  computing  the  TAFMSD,  Total  Federal  Military Service  Date  (TFMSD),  TAFCSD,  TFCSD,  TYSD,  Total  Enlisted  Military  Service  Date (TEMSD),  the  Pay  Date,  and  the  1405  Service  Date  (terms  explained  in  Table  1.1).    The Department  of  Defense  Financial  Management  Regulation  (DoDFMR)  Volume  7A,  Chapter  1, paragraph,  010104A  explains  how  to  compute  the  basic  Pay  Date.    Use  the  same  basic computation in computing other service dates.  Use Table 1.1, Rules 13 and 14, to determine the DIERF and DIEUS dates. 1.4.1.  Do not adjust service dates and DOR for officers on EAD before 15 September 1981, because  of  the  Defense  Officer  Personnel  Management  Act  (DOPMA),  except  as  DOPMA authorizes.  Continue to apply regulations in effect before 15 September l981, when you need to verify or adjust these officers' service dates. 1.4.2.  Do not adjust service dates and dates of rank for Reserve officers on strength before 1 October 1996, because of the Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act (ROPMA), except as ROPMA authorizes.  Continue to apply regulations in effect before 1 October 1996, when you need to verify or adjust these officers’ service dates. 1.4.3.  HQ  AFPC/DPSIPV  restores  service  dates  to  the  member’s  original  dates  prior  to  separation or discharge when a court order or the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records directs reinstatement to active duty. 1.4.4.  In  computing  the  TFCSD  of  USAFR  officers  or  Chief  Warrant  Officers,  begin  with the  date  the  officer  accepted  a  commission.    For  ANG  officers,  start  with  date  of  Federal Recognition. 1.4.5.  In converting months into days and days into months, consider each month as 30 days (including February). 1.4.6.  In subtracting inclusive dates, add 1 day to the remainder.  Exception:  If remainder is 31 do not add a day to the total. 1.4.7.  If a computed service date is 30 February, record it as 1 March.  If a computed service date is 29 February, record it as 29 February, even if the year is not a leap year.   6  AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012 1.4.8.  If a computed service date is in a leap year, change 29 February to 30 February, but do not change 28 February.  In other than leap year, change 28 February to 30 February.  Never change the beginning date. 1.4.9.  If  a  member  enters  on  EAD  while  on  a  tour  of  active  duty  for  training  (ADT),  or active duty (AD), or on the day after the last day of the ADT or AD tour, there is no break in active  service.    Consider  TAFMSD  and  TAFCSD  as  the  first  day  of  the  tour  and  backdate them by previous creditable active duty service. 1.4.10.  In  computing  the  TAFMSD,  TAFCSD,  TFCSD,  TYSD,  and  TEMSD,  include  all periods of ADT.  For a tour of 30 days or less, count the actual number of days. 1.5.  Changing  Service  Dates  of  Personnel  on  EAD  for  Lost  Time.  (HQ  AFPC/DPSFR, Future  Operations)  DoDFMR,  Vol  7A,  Chapter  1,  paragraph  010104A  and  AFI  36-2134,  Air Force  Duty  Status  Program.    DoDFMR,  Vol  7A,  Chapter  1,  paragraph  010104A,  provides specifics and illustrations on how to compute service dates for Airmen with lost time.  AFI 36-2134,  on  the  other  hand,  is  the  governing  directive  for  the  Air  Force  duty  status  program  and defines the conditions that may result in lost time reporting. 1.5.1.  HQ  AFPC/DPSOTED  processes  AF  Form  2098,  Duty  Status  Change,  through  HQ AFPC/DPSIPV.    Use  AF  Form  2098  to  adjust  the  TAFMSD,  Pay  Date  of  enlisted  and TAFSCD  for  officers,  TEMSD  (master  sergeants  and  senior  master  sergeants  only),  by  the number of days lost, and complete a new AF Form 1613. 1.5.2.  Reenlistment  or  Separations.    Headquarters  Air  Force  Personnel  Center,  Skills Management  Branch  (HQ  AFPC/DPSOA)  adjusts  the  date  of  separation  (DOS),  if  no projected  extensions  exist,  and  the  expiration  term  of  service  (ETS),  if  applicable,  on  a day-for-day basis. If the member has a projected extension, the DOS will be adjusted in whole months based on the adjusted ETS. A  B  C  If service date to be computed is  and individual is  then this date includes  Total Active Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD)    enlisted, officer, or warrant officer  2  Total Active Federal Commissioned Service Date (TAFCSD)  an officer or Chief Warrant  Officer 3 Total Federal Commissioned Service Date (TFCSD)  an officer or  Chief Warrant  Officer AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012   7   Table 1.1.  Explanation of Service Dates. R  U L E  1  all periods of active federal military service in commissioned, warrant, flight officer, or enlisted status.  When there is no break in AD from date of original entry of such duty, TAFMSD is the date of original entry on AD. When there is a break in AD, TAFMSD is later than the date of original entry on AD by a period equal to the break or breaks.  Does not include AD while a student at Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences (USUHS) or Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) or Financial Assistance Program (FAP).  Includes concurrent enlisted cadet status and solely cadet status at a service academy for enlisted only.  all periods of AD federal commissioned service.  When there is no break in AD commissioned service from original date of entry on AD in such status, TAFCSD is the date of original entry on AD in commissioned status.  When there is a break the TAFCSD is later than the date of original entry on AD in commissioned status by a period equal to the break or breaks.  Does not include AD while a student at USUHS, HPSP or FAP. all periods of federally recognized commissioned service, whether active or non-active duty.  When there is no break in commissioned service from date of acceptance of original commission or from date of original federal recognition, TFCSD is the date of acceptance of original commission or the date of federal recognition, as appropriate. When there is a break, the TFCSD is later than the date of acceptance of original commission or the date of original federal recognition by a period equal to the break or breaks.     8  AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012 Total Years Service Date (TYSD)  4  a Reserve officer 5  a Reserve officer  Date of Rank (DOR)  Current Grade Date of Rank (CGDOR)  6  a Regular or Reserve officer  7  Total Enlisted Military Service Date (TEMSD)  enlisted  8  Pay Date  enlisted or officer  9  Extended Active Duty (EAD) (see note 5)  enlisted  all service as a commissioned officer of any uniformed service; all service in a federally recognized commissioned status in the National Guard (NG); all service in the NG after 14 June 1933, when such service was continuous from the date of federal recognition as a NG officer to the date of appointment in the NG; and all service credited under Title 10, U.S.C., Section 12207 (Service in the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps is not creditable).

For example, a member graduating from Officer Training School (OTS) is assigned an EAD date equal to the date of acceptance as a commissioned officer.  Later, the member involuntarily separates and immediately enlists in the Regular Air Force (RegAF).  In this case, back date the EAD date to the date of enlistment for OTS.  10   a Regular officer or warrant officer service from the date of acceptance of commission or appointment in the RegAF.  AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012   9  11   a Reserve officer  12   1405 Service Date (service for retirement pay multiplier)  enlisted or officer with "18-plus years active military service"  13  Date Initial Entry Uniformed Service (DIEUS) enlisted, officer, or warrant officer 14  Date Initial Entry Reserve Forces (DIERF) enlisted, officer, or warrant officer in any reserve or national guard component  service from the date the member entered on current tour of EAD (Do not change this date for officers who are appointed in the Air Force while serving on EAD in the Air Force, or for noncareer officers with an established date of separation who accept Career Reserve Status while serving under a specified period of time contract).  However, the EAD date of a Reserve officer who transfers to the Air Force while on EAD with another service is the date the officer is ordered to EAD with the Air Force.  When an officer enters EAD while serving on a specified short tour of AD for training, the EAD is the date the officer enters EAD. all service creditable under Title 10, U.S.C., Section 1405,(Reserve/Guard) computed according to AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements.  Include service for basic pay before 1 June 1958; all active duty after 31 May 1958; 1 day for each inactive duty point earned while not on AD limited to 130 points, including membership points in any 1 retirement year  (Title 10, U.S.C., Section 12733).  service from the date of initial acceptance of commission, appointment, or enlistment in any branch of the Armed Forces (Regular or Reserve; active or inactive).  This is a fixed date and is not adjusted for time lost or breaks in service.  It includes enlistment as a Reserve in the Senior ROTC program, or as a scholarship cadet or midshipman under Title 10, U.S.C., 2107 or 2107a, enlistment under Title 10, U.S.C., 12103, enlistment in active component delayed entry/enlistment program (DEP), and entrance as a cadet or midshipman at a service academy. the date of initial acceptance of commission, appointment, or enlistment in any Reserve component of the Armed Forces. This is a fixed date and is not adjusted for time lost or breaks in service.  Enlistment or commissioning not for initial affiliation with a participating Reserve program, the DIERF will be the subsequent date that the individual re-affiliates with the Reserve component.  This date does include time in the active component, Delayed Entry (Enlistment) Program (DEP), Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), or professional appointment program (see note 6). This date can be later than Pay Date.    10  AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012 15   Current Grade Effective enlisted or officer  Date/Permanent Grade Effective Date  the date an individual is entitled to the pay and authority of the grade (see note 7 for officers).  NOTES:  1.  DOR is used to determine a commissioned officer’s eligibility for a Reserve promotion. TFCSD determines active Reserve status based on maximum service under Title 10, U.S.C., Section 14507 or Section 14508(a) and (b) for officers appointed on or after 1 July 1955. 2.  Limit service credit to 18 years for lieutenant colonels and to 21 years for colonels. 3.  Use DOR to determine the eligibility for Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act (ROPMA) promotion for a Reserve officer not on the Active Duty List (ADL).  When promoted, award a DOR according to AFI 36-2504, Officer Promotion, Continuation and Selective Early Removal in the Reserve of the Air Force.  HQ ARPC/DPB, Promotions Branch is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for Reserve officers not on the ADL.  National Guard Bureau (NGB)/A01 is the OPR for ANG officers not on the ADL.  4.  TEMSD applies only to master and senior master sergeants.  5.  AD pay begins the date a reserve member begins travel in compliance with an EAD order.  Use the travel voucher or DD Form 220, Active Duty Report, in determining EAD.  The EAD date will not be earlier than the date reflected on the AF Form 766, Extended Active Duty Order (block 13).  If travel is earlier than EAD order, then establish EAD as first day of EAD order.  Enlisted members of the Regular Air Force who hold appointments as Reserve of the Air Force commissioned officers have dual status.  Establish the EAD date as the first day of travel determined by the travel voucher or DD Form 220.  If enlisted member is discharged (DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty Discharge Certificate) more than 1 day prior to the first day of travel, a break of active duty will occur.  Should this occur, contact HQ AFPC/DPSOS for administrative correction of the DD Form 214.  6.  If an ROTC graduate chooses to participate in the Selected Reserve instead of normal active duty, the DIERF is the date of commissioning, if there is no earlier qualifying date.  7.  These dates are never earlier than TFCSD.  If the officer receives constructive credit according to AFI 36-2005, Appointment in Commissioned Grades and Designation and Assignment in Professional Categories – Reserve of the Air Force and United States Air Force, do not reflect it in either date.   AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012   11  Table 1.2.

Credit AD, including ADT for active Reserve and National Guard personnel, as a commissioned officer, commissioned warrant officer, Army field clerk, and enlisted member of the uniformed services (service under Title 32, U.S.C., Section 503, Section 504, and Section 505).  2.  Credit AD, including ADT as a commissioned officer and commissioned warrant officer of the uniformed services (service under Title 32, U.S.C., Section 503, Section 504, and Section 505).  3.  Credit active and non-active duty as a commissioned officer and commissioned warrant officer.  This includes any period for which a member of the armed forces is on one of the following:  the Regular retired list as a commissioned officer or commissioned warrant officer; a non-Regular retired list (such as USAF retired), if the member concurrently holds a valid commission, or a TDRL.  Do not count any period more than once.  4.  Credit only enlisted service.  This date only applies to master sergeants and senior master ser-geants.  See AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion Program, for further information.  5.  Do not credit active duty while a student in the HPSP or the USUHS as active military or active commissioned service.  Credit service while in the HPSP or USUHS for TFCSD and TYSD.  For Regular or Reserve members who have been reappointed to Medical Service Corps (MSC), Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC), or Nurse Corps (NC) or who graduated from the HPSP or USUHS, reduce credited service by the amount of time in the HPSP or USUHS program.  6.  For USUHS participants whose enrollment is terminated before graduation, the service at USUHS is creditable in determining years of service for retired pay multiplier under Title 10, U.S.C., Section 1405.  7.  Do not credit time spent in ISLRS, or any other inactive Reserve service after 31 May 1958.   16  AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012 Creditable service includes: all service for basic pay before 1 June l958; all active duty after  31 May 1958; one day for each inactive duty point earned while not on active duty (including membership points) in any one retirement year, limited to:  60 points (1 Jun 58 through 22 Sep 96); 75 points (23 Sep 96 through 29 Oct 00); 90 points (30 Oct 00 through 29 Oct 07); 130 points (30 Oct 07, and in any subsequent year of service).  According to Title 10, U.S.C., Section 12733.  8.  Table 1.1, Rule 12, defines creditable service.  It is not retroactive or grandfathered for retirement.  9.  For officers, do not credit service performed in advanced ROTC after 12 October 1964, for any purpose except military service obligation, unless a member of the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP) after 1 August 1979 (Title 10, U.S.C., Section 2106 and Section 2107). 10.  Service as an enlisted member in the USAFR under the DEP before 1 Jan 85 is creditable for pay. The time between the date of enlistment in the DEP and the date the member begins serving on active duty in a regular component is creditable for pay if the date of enlistment in the Reserve component is before 1 January 1985.  For Reserve enlistments after 27 November 1989, the time served in a Reserve component prior to the member’s entry on active duty or active duty for training is creditable if the member performs inactive duty for training between the date of enlistment in the Reserve component and the date of entry on active duty, or active duty for training. 11.  Include the constructive service credit in computing the Pay Date and 1405 Service Date authorized under Title 37, U.S.C., Section 205a(7) and (8) as repealed by Public Law 96-513, 94 Stat. 2835, DOPMA for persons who on 14 September 1981 were medical or dental officers in the armed forces, or participating in a program leading to an MC or DC appointment and were subsequently reappointed as an MC or DC officer, or who held an MC or DC commission in the Public Health Service (PHS).  UHUHS credit is for Post-DOPMA students only.  The maximum constructive service credit is 4 years for MC or DC officers and 1 additional year for medical officers who completed a medical internship or equivalent or entered military status while serving such internship.  Credit PHS for pay provided it does not duplicate a period of professional training awarded under computation of constructive service credit under Title 37, U.S.C., Section 205(7) and (8).  To receive this service credit, an officer in one of the above categories must have taken the oath of office on 14 September 1981 or earlier.  Members entitled to this constructive service credit on 14 September 1981, who are subsequently discharged and later reappointed an MC or DC officer remain eligible for this constructive service credit regardless of the break in service.  12.  Credit service as a cadet or midshipman at a military service academy only for enlisted personnel.  Do not credit such service for officers.  However, if a commissioned officer who attended a military service academy reverts to an enlisted status, then credit the time served at an academy.  Do not credit such service if re-commissioned from enlisted status.  Credit the time served at a military service academy preparatory school in an enlisted status for both enlisted and officer personnel.  Disenrolled Senior ROTC cadets receive credit for pay only. 13.  Air Force Reserve components do not use specific dates for the TAFMSD and TAFCSD; instead, they work with an amount of time (years, months, and days). AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012   17  Chapter 2 CURRENT GRADE DATE OF RANK (CGDOR) AND DATE OF RANK (DOR) 2.1.  Determining the  Initial  CGDOR  of  Commissioned  Officers  on  EAD.  HQ AFPC/DPSIPV  computes  and  enters  in  MilPDS the  Current  Grade  Date  of  Rank  (CGDOR)  of Commissioned Officers on EAD.  Headquarters, Air Force Personnel Center, Officer Promotions (HQ AFPC/DPSOO) updates the CGDOR on subsequent promotions. 2.1.1.  The CGDOR of a Regular or Reserve officer on an Active Duty List (ADL) in a grade held as result of a promotion is the effective date of the promotion. 2.1.2.  The CGDOR of a Regular officer on original appointment is the date of appointment, unless: 2.1.2.1.  The  officer  was,  at  the  time  of  Regular  appointment,  a  Reserve  officer  on  the ADL, the CGDOR is the same as that held by the officer immediately before appointment as a Regular officer. 2.1.2.2.  The  officer  receives  constructive  service  or  entry  grade  credit,  the  CGDOR reflects  an  earlier date determined by the extent to  which the service credit exceeds the credit required for the officer's appointment grade. 2.1.3.  Adjust the CGDOR of a retired officer ordered to EAD by adding the period between the retirement date and the effective date of EAD to the CGDOR held at retirement. 2.1.4.  Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL).  The officer retains the CGDOR held prior to going on TDRL.  The EAD order announces the DOR. 2.1.5.  The CGDOR of a Reserve officer ordered to EAD in the current  Reserve grade held (AFI  36-2008,  Voluntary  Extended  Active  Duty  (EAD)  for  Air  Reserve  Commissioned Officers)  will  retain  their  DOR  with  the  EAD  as  the  CGDOR  Effective  Date  if  the  officer was continuously assigned to the Selected Reserve (SelRes) since the most recent promotion. 2.1.5.1.  An  officer  who  served  in  the  other  than  Selected  Reserve  (OTSR)  since  their most  recent  promotion  will  have  their  DOR  adjusted  to  reflect  the  time  spent  in  the OTSR. 2.1.5.1.1.  For  any  OTSR  assignment  other  than  the  Inactive  Status  List  Reserve Section (ISLRS) or Retired Reserve since the most recent promotion, credit half a day for each day of commissioned service while assigned to OTSR. 2.1.5.1.2.  For  officers  assigned  to  ISLRS  or  Retired  Reserve  since  the  most  recent promotion,  compute  adjusted  DOR  by  subtracting  current  DOR  from  the  date assigned  to  ISLRS,  resulting  in  years,  months,  and  days  of  creditable  service  in current  grade.    Subtract  creditable  service  from  Effective  Date  Change  Strength Accountability  (EDCSA)  (date  returned  to  an  active  status)  resulting  in  adjusted DOR.  CGDOR effective date is EDCSA. 2.1.5.1.3.  Effective  1  October  1996,  Reserve  officers  ordered  to  active  duty  and placed on the ADL from the Reserve Active Status List (RASL) maintain their rank   18  AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012 and date of rank.  Reserve officers ordered to active duty from ISLRS will have their date of rank computed according to paragraphs. 2.1.5.2. and 2.1.5.3. 2.1.5.2.  HQ  AFPC/DPSIPV  computes  service  grade  credit  for  line  of  the  Air  Force officers as follows: 2.1.5.2.1.  Officers  on  the  RASL,  who  were  selected  for  promotion  by  a  mandatory promotion  board  or  a  special  selection  board,  and  who  before  being  promoted  are placed  on  the  ADL  of  the  same  armed  force  and  in  the  same  competitive  category, shall be placed on  an appropriate promotion  list  for officers on the ADL.  Effective date  of  promotion  and  date  of  rank  shall  be  the  same  as  if  the  officer  had  been selected to the grade concerned by the promotion board for ADL officers. 2.1.5.2.2.  For  an  officer  ordered  to  EAD  in  the  grade  of  second  lieutenant,  credit  1 day for each day that the officer performed active--but not active duty--commissioned service, if all of the following conditions apply: 2.1.5.2.3.  The officer was commissioned through Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) before 1 July 1992; 2.1.5.2.4.  The officer's EAD was delayed under AFI 36-2009, Delay in Active Duty for  AFROTC  Graduates  before  1  June  1999  for  full-time  instruction  in  graduate  or professional studies. 2.1.5.2.5.  The  officer  receives  the  graduate  or  professional  degree  before  beginning EAD;  or  the  officer's  delay  terminates  because  of  an  order  to  meet  Air  Force requirements,  in  accordance  with  AFI  36-2009.    Note:    Do  not  use  this  provision when a delay terminates because the officer fails to maintain acceptable academic or retention standards or fails to comply with Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) requirements as AFI 36-2009 directs. 2.1.6.  HQ AFPC/DPSIPV computes the CGDOR for non-line Air Force officers ordered to EAD  in  a  grade  established  according  to  AFI  36-2008,  Table  1,  Rules  2  through  10, Paragraph11, and this AFI, Table 2.1. and Table 2.2. 2.1.6.1.  Officers  designated  as  Judge  Advocates  (JA)  or  assigned  as  an  attorney  in  the Air  Force  General  Counsel's  Honors  Program  entering  EAD  in  the  grade  of  first lieutenant, the CGDOR effective date  is the EAD date (see AFI 36-2008, Table 1, Note 3). 2.1.6.2.  For  physicians  appointed  in  the  grade  of  lieutenant  colonel  or  colonel  and ordered  to  EAD,  the  CGDOR  is  equal  to  the  commissioning  date  and  the  CGDOR effective date is the EAD. 2.1.7.  Officers who separate from and later return to EAD retain the CGDOR held at time of separation, provided one of the following applies: the officer is returning to EAD in the same grade  and  same  competitive  category  (regardless  of  branch  of  service)  within  1  year  of release or discharge from EAD, the officer is a Medical Corps (MC) officer returning to EAD after completing a military leave of absence (redeferment) authorized by HQ AFPC/DPAME. 2.1.8.  Senior ROTC cadets  appointed as second  lieutenants  in  the Reserves under Title 10, U.S.C.,  Section  2106  or  Section  2107,  in  May  or  June  and  ordered  to  EAD,  the  CGDOR equals the graduation date from the United States Service Academy that particular year. AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012   19  2.1.8.1.  For appointees entering EAD from 1 July through 30 April, compute according to paragraph 2.1.5.1.1. 2.1.8.2.  For  a  Reserve  or  ANG  officer  entering  EAD  under  Title  32  or  Title  10  the CGDOR equals the Reserve date of rank. 2.1.9.  For an officer transferring from another branch of service (EAD to EAD) according to AFI  36-2004,  Interservice  Transfer  of  Officers  to  the  United  States  Air  Force  (USAF)  and The United States Air Force Reserves (USAFR), the CGDOR equals the DOR announced in the EAD order. 2.1.9.1.  HQ  AFPC/DPAMF,  HQ  AFPC/DPAH,  AF/JAX  manually  computes constructive  grade  credit  IAW  AFI  36-2005.    Constructive  grade  credit  may  consist  of but not limited to advanced degrees, professional experience and work experience in the specialty or prior service as an officer to include United States Public Health Service as applicable. 2.2.  Determining DOR of Enlisted on Enlistment or Reenlistment in the Regular Air Force (RegAF).  HQ  AFPC/DPSOE,  HQ  AFPC/DPSOA,  and  Military  Personnel  Section (MPS)/Customer Support determine DOR on enlistment or reenlistment. 2.2.1.  Enlisted in the following categories receive a DOR equal to the date of enlistment in the RegAF (Note: Reserve enlistees must meet the TAFMS criteria for grade): 2.2.1.1.  Nonprior-service enlistees. 2.2.1.2.  Prior-service enlistees who have served less than 24 months TAFMS. 2.2.1.3.  Former  members  of  a  regular  component  enlisting  on  or  after  their  6th anniversary of their DOS. 2.2.1.4.  Reservists who enlist in a pay grade higher than their last grade held in a regular component. 2.2.1.5.  Reservists who have never served in a regular component. 2.2.2.  For  prior-service  RegAF  members  enlisting  in  the  same  grade  and  in  an  Air  Force Specialty Code (AFSC) at the 3-skill level or higher for a Directed Duty Assignment (DDA) or for retraining into a designated AFSC, compute the DOR as follows: 2.2.2.1.  Adjust the DOR by the number of days break in active duty if the break is less than four years. 2.2.2.2.  Adjust  so  that  the  current  time  in  grade  (TIG)  is  one-half  of  the  member’s previous TIG, when the  enlistment  date is  on or after the  fourth  anniversary and before the sixth anniversary of the DOS. 2.2.2.3.  The  DOR  equals  date  of  enlistment  when  the  enlistment  date  is on  or  after  the sixth anniversary of the DOS. 2.2.2.4.  If a member was serving in a regular component other than RegAF and enlists in a lower grade due to TAFMSD criteria, the DOR will be computed using the member’s  original DOR for the enlistment grade and applying criteria set out in paragraph 2.2.2.1 through 2.2.2.3.  If a member received a promotion(s) in a Reserve component and enlists in a lower grade due to TAFMS criteria and the enlistment grade was previously held in a   20  AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012 regular  component,  DOR  will  be  computed  using  the  member’s  original  DOR  for  the enlistment grade and applying the criteria set out in paragraphs 2.2.2.1 through 2.2.2.3.  If the enlistment grade was not held in a regular component, the DOR will be equal to the date of enlistment. Figure 2.1.  Example of DOR Computation.  Start with date of RegAF enlistment.  Subtract the sum of the DOS (Block 12b, Separation Date This Period on DD Form 214) + 1  day. The difference is the break in service between regular components  DOS + 1 (Block 12b on DD Form 214) Subtract DOR (Block 12h, Effective Date of Pay Grade on DD Form 214) TIG at time of discharge from regular component  00-03-20  95-01-12 05-02-08    95-01-12 93-09-19    1-03-23  TIG at time of discharge from regular component TIG credit as indicated above (multiply by “.5” for half credit and “1” for full credit computes TIG for new DOR  1-03-23 x .5 0-07-27  NOTE:  Months are computed as 30 days.  Fractions in day column are rounded up to the next whole number.  2.2.3.  For Reserve members serving on EAD with  the RegAF who  are discharged  from  an Air Reserve Component (ARC) for immediate reenlistment in the RegAF, adjust their DOR as above and credit time served on current EAD, provided they meet the TAFMS criteria for the grade in which they are serving. 2.2.4.  Former  Air  Force  commissioned  officers  with  reenlistment  rights  under  Title  10, U.S.C., Section 8258, receive the same DOR they held on discharge from enlisted status to serve on EAD as a commissioned officer, provided they reenlist within 6 months after release from commissioned officer status. 2.2.5.  For  former  members  of  any  other  regular  components  of  the  armed  forces,  compute the DOR as indicated in paragraph 2.2.4 provided their skill is on the Prior Service Required Skills List and they are eligible to enlist through the Prior Service program. 2.2.6.  Reserve members serving on EAD with the RegAF who are discharged from an ARC for  immediate  reenlistment  in  the  RegAF  keep  the  same  DOR  they  held  on  discharge, provided they meet the TAFMS criteria for the grade in which they are serving. 2.3.  Determining  DOR  of    Reserve  Enlisted  Ordered  to  or  Released  from  EAD.  HQ AFPC/DPSOE,  HQ  AFPC/DPSOA  and  MPS/Customer  Support  determine  DOR  for  Reserve enlisted ordered to or released from EAD. AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012   21  2.3.1.  Enlisted  entering  EAD  or  enlisted  Airmen  involuntarily  ordered  to  EAD  or  entering EAD under Title 10, U.S.C., Section 12310, the AD DOR is the same as the Reserve DOR. 2.3.2.  For Airmen voluntarily ordered to EAD, compute the AD DOR by backdating the date entered EAD by a period equal to: 2.3.2.1.  The  creditable  service  the  Airman  received  under  Table  1.3,  column  B,  while serving in above the grade in which the Airman is entering EAD; or 2.3.2.2.  One day for each retirement point the Airman earned in an Air Force component while  serving  in  or  above,  the  grade  in  which  the  Airman  is  entering  EAD,  excluding membership points. 2.3.2.3.  Do  not  credit  service  that  the  member  performed  before  a  break  in  service  of more than 90 days, for Regular or Reserve members, or more than 6 months for former commissioned  or  warrant  officers  entitled  to  reenlist  under  Title  10,  U.S.C.,  Section 8258. 2.3.2.4.  Do not credit service that the member performed before a break in service when the  break  in  service  was  followed  with  service  in  a  grade  lower  than  the  one  in  which they  entered  EAD.      Note:    For  Reserve  Airmen  voluntarily  ordered  to  EAD,  the  MPS servicing the AD unit to which they are reporting asks HQ AFPC/ DPSOAA to determine the DOR. 2.3.3.  Other Enlisted Ordered to EAD. 2.3.3.1.  Former  AFROTC  cadets  ordered  to  EAD  under  Title  10,  U.S.C.,  Section  2105 and Section 2107, keep the DOR specified on their Reserve enlistment contract. 2.3.3.2.  Former  Air  Force  Academy  cadets  transferred  to  the  Air  Force  Reserve  and ordered  to  EAD  under  Title  10,  U.S.C.,  Section  9348,  keep  the  DOR  established  on disenrollment. The disenrollment order records the DOR. 2.3.3.3.  Reserve  enlisted  voluntarily  ordered  to  EAD  under  Title  10,  U.S.C.,  Section 12301, by HQ AFPC/ DPSOAA keep the DOR that their unit established before EAD. 2.3.4.  Reserve  enlisted  voluntarily  released  from  EAD  in  the  same  grade  in  which  they entered  such  duty  keep  the  DOR  they  held  before  entering  EAD.  If  they  are  released  from EAD in a different grade, they keep their AD DOR. 2.4.  Determining DOR of Retired Enlisted Ordered to EAD.  HQ AFPC/DPSIPV establishes the DOR of retired Airmen ordered to EAD by adding the period between the date they retired and the date they returned to AD to the DOR they held when they retired. 2.5.  Determining  DOR  of  Promoted  Enlisted.  HQ  AFPC/DPSOE,  HQ  AFRC/A1K,  HQ ARPC/DPB, and MPS/Customer Support determine the DOR of promoted member. The DOR of member  promoted  to  a  grade  above  airman  basic  is  the  same  as  the  effective  date  of  the promotion, except when paragraphs 2.5.1 through 2.5.6 apply. 2.5.1.  Determining  DOR  when  the  commander  withholds  a  promotion  on  the  basis  of  AFI 36-2502,  Airman  Promotion  Program,  the  member's  DOR  is  the  date  the  member  would have  been  promoted  originally.    The  effective  date  is  the  date  the  commander  ends  the withhold action.   22  AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012 2.5.2.  When  the  commander  defers  a  promotion  IAW  of  AFI  36-2502,  the  member's  DOR and  effective  date  are  the  first  day  of  the  month  following  the  month  in  which  the  deferral ended.  If  the  commander  ends  deferral  action  on  the  first  day  of  the  month,  the  DOR  and effective date are that date. 2.5.3.  The  DOR  of  a  member  selected  for  promotion,  but  by  chance  not  promoted  on  the established promotion date, is the DOR the member would have received had the promotion occurred on time. 2.5.4.  The DOR of a regular enlisted member selected in one cycle, but not promoted until the  next  cycle  because  of  lack  of  grade  vacancies,  is  the  date  the  member  would  have received had the promotion occurred on the last day of the first cycle. 2.5.5.  When  a  USAFR  enlisted  member  is  demoted    and  is  subsequently  promoted,  adjust the DOR to credit previous service in the same grade or a higher grade. 2.5.6.  Once a USAFR enlisted member's (E-5 through E-9) promotion is approved, the DOR is the first day of the promotion month after the member first meets eligibility requirements.  Once a USAFR enlisted member’s (E-2 through E-4) promotion is approved, the DOR is the date  the  member  meets  eligibility  requirements.    This  applies  to  unit  member,  Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA), and Active Guard Reserve (AGR). 2.6.  Determining  DOR  at  Enlistment/Reenlistment  in  the  USAFR.  Compute  DOR  for USAFR enlisted Airmen as follows: 2.6.1.  An Airman who is discharged or separates from any U.S. armed force with a military service obligation  (MSO) and transfers (no break in  service) in  the same  grade held,  to  the USAFR.  The DOR is the same as that held while serving with the previous component. 2.6.2.  An  Airman  who  is  discharged  or  separates  from  any  U.S.  armed  force  without  an MSO,  and  enlists  in  the  USAFR  the  following  day  (no  break  in  service).    The  DOR  is  the same as that held while serving with the previous component. 2.6.3.  An  Airman  who  is  discharged  or  separates  from  any  U.S.  armed  force  without  an MSO and does not immediately enlist with the USAFR (a break in service occurs).  Add the break  in  service  to  the  DOR  held  while  serving  in  the  previous  component.    Example:    A staff  sergeant  with  DOR  of  1  May  1995,  is  discharged  from  U.S.  Army  on  13  Nov  1997, enlists with the USAFR on 6 Jun 1999.  The staff sergeant had a break in service of 1 year, 6 months, and 24 days.  Add the break in service to the DOR held at discharge (1 May 1995) and the new DOR is 25 Nov 1996. 2.7.  Determining DOR of Demoted Enlisted.  HQ AFPC/DPSOE and MPS/Customer Support determine DOR of demoted enlisted members. 2.7.1.  The  DOR  in  the  grade  to  which  an  enlisted  member  is  reduced  under  AFI  36-2503, paragraphs 3.2 through 3.4, is the same as the effective date of the demotion action. 2.7.1.1.  If the enlisted member is eligible to apply for retirement in lieu of demotion but does  not  elect  to  retire,  the  effective  date  and  DOR  are  the  fourth  workday  after  the member acknowledges receipt of demotion approval notification. 2.7.1.2.  If the enlisted member is demoted under AFI 36-2503, paragraph 3.1, the DOR is the date on which the member first performed service in the reduced grade. AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012   23  2.7.2.  The  DOR  in  the  grade  to  which  an  enlisted  member  is  reduced  under  Article  15, Uniformed  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ),  is  the  date  of  the  endorsement  (or  letter) directing the reduction. 2.7.2.1.  If  a  reduction  is  "set  aside,"  the  DOR  and  effective  date  revert  to  the  original DOR and effective date the member held before reduction. 2.7.2.2.  If  a  reduction  is  later  suspended,  the  DOR  reverts  to  the  one  held  prior  to  the reduction. Effective date is the date of the letter directing the suspension. 2.7.2.3.  If a reduction is suspended but the suspension is  later vacated, the DOR in  the grade to which the member is reduced is the date of the original reduction endorsement or letter. The effective date, however, is the date of the vacation action. 2.7.2.4.  When the punishment is mitigated to the extent that the former grade is restored, the DOR and effective date are the date of the mitigation action. 2.7.3.  If a grade reduction occurs because of a court-martial sentence, the enlisted member's  DOR  and  effective  date  are  the  date  the  convening  authority  approves  the  court-martial sentence, unless the  court-martial  order specifies  another date of "action"  by the convening authority. 2.7.4.  The DOR of a USAFR enlisted member demoted under AFI 36-2503, paragraph 17.1, is the date of the demotion order.  Prepare orders as soon as you receive the endorsement or letter directing the reduction. 2.7.4.1.  For a USAFR enlisted member reduced under AFI 36-2503, paragraph 17.2, the DOR is the former DOR of the grade to which the member is reduced. 2.7.4.2.  For a USAFR enlisted member reduced under AFI 36-2503, paragraph 17.2, to a grade  not  previously  held,  the  DOR  for  the  reduced  grade  is  the  date  on  which  the member first performs active service in the lowest grade held. 2.7.4.3.  For a USAFR enlisted member reduced under AFI 36-2503, paragraphs 17.6.3, 17.6.4,  or  17.6.5,  the  DOR  is  the  former  DOR  of  the  grade  to  which  the  member  is reduced.  If the USAFR member is reduced to a grade not previously held, the DOR for the  reduced  grade  is  the  date  on  which  the  member  first  performs  active  service  in  the lowest  grade  held.    For  both,  the  effective  date  is  the  day  prior  to  the  EDCSA  of reassignment. 2.8.  Determining  DOR  for  Enlisted  Retrained  or  Reassigned  from  Band  Duties.  HQ USAF/A1PF determines the DOR when a member of the USAF or Air Force Space Command Band either retrains or is reassigned from the band Air Force Specialty Code. 2. 9.  Adjusting Enlisted DOR to Deduct Lost Time.  When adjusting a member's service date to  deduct  lost  time  (paragraph  1.5),  also  adjust  the  DOR  to  deduct  the  lost  time.    When computing DOR, compute the actual number of days lost in that grade on a day-for-day basis.    24  AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012 Table 2.1.

Do not credit an officer whose DOR takes effect on appointment or reappointment according to AFI 36-2005, paragraph 2.19, which makes the officer eligible for promotion or promotion consideration within 12 months of the date the officer accepted the appointment.  This restriction gives the officer enough time to earn at least one OPR before promotion consideration under  AFI36-2604  5 OCTOBER 2012   27  AFI 36-2504.  5.
