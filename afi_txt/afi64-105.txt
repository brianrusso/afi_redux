Background. 1.1.1.  The  purpose  of  this  document  is  to  provide  guidance  on  established  policies,  assign responsibilities  and  prescribe  implementation  procedures  for  the  organizing,  training,  and equipping of the Air Force contingency contracting force (CCF).  The guidance also provides directions  on  accomplishing  contract  support  tasks  normally  encountered  while  supporting contingency operations  and how those tasks support the joint  Operational Contract  Support (OCS)  process.    The  intent  of  this  guidance  is  to  establish  and  maintain  responsive contracting support for military contingencies and local incident response. 1.2.  Types of Contingencies. 1.2.1.  Declared Contingencies. 1.2.1.1.  In  accordance  with  10  U.S.C.    Section  101(a)  (13)  a  “contingency  operation” requires a formal declaration by: 1.2.1.1.1.  The  Secretary  of  Defense  (SecDef)  when  members  of  the  armed  forces become involved in military actions against an enemy of the United States; or 1.2.1.1.2.  The  President  or  Congress  when  members  of  the  uniformed  forces  are called  to  active  duty  (a  reserve  component  mobilization)  under  10  U.S.C.  or  any provision of law during a declared war or national emergency. 1.2.1.2.  As a result of a declared contingency, micro-purchase and simplified acquisition thresholds  are  increased.    Since  some  contracting  activities  may  award  contracts  in support  of  declared  contingency  operations  as  well  as  non-contingency  operations,  the responsible  Head  of  the  Contracting  Activity  (HCA)  determines  which  contracted supplies  or  services  are  being  used  in  support  of  a  declared  contingency  operation  (see Federal  Acquisition  Regulation  (FAR)  18.201(b)  and    (c)  and  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation  Supplement  (DFARS)  218.271).    AFFARS  HCA  Matrix  at  MP 5301.601(a)(i)  shows  the  delegations  available  from  the  HCA  to    Senior  Contracting Officials  (SCOs),  Senior  Center  Contracting  Officials  (SCCOs)  and  Chief  of  the Contracting Office (COCO). 1.2.2.  Undeclared  Contingencies.    These  types  of  contingencies  generally  do  not  benefit from the legal flexibilities, such as increased thresholds provided for a declared contingency.  The only exception are the acquisition of supplies or services that, as determined by the head of  the  agency,  will  be  used  to  facilitate  defense  against  (or  recovery  from)  chemical, biological,  radiological,  or  nuclear  (CBRN)  attack  (see  FAR  13.201(g)(1)).    Many  of  the local emergencies responded to in accordance with the Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP) will be local non-declared contingencies. 1.2.2.1.  Local  Emergencies.    In  accordance  with  AFI  10-2501,  Air  Force  Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, the IEMP provides comprehensive guidance  for  emergency  response threats  resulting  from  natural, technological,  or  man-made  hazards.    In  developing  and  maintaining  the  contracting to  physical 6 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 supplements, checklists, or portions of an IEMP, the chief of the contracting activity will ensure the areas listed in Chapter 10 of this AFI are addressed. (T-3) 1.3.  Contracting and Command Authority. 1.3.1.  Contracting  Authority.    Contracting  authority  is  the  legal  authority  to  enter  into binding contracts and obligate funds on behalf of the United States Government (USG).  A unique  aspect  of  contracting  support  is  that  only  a  contracting  officer  has  contracting authority.  Their authority to acquire supplies, services and construction for the government comes  from  three  sources:    the  Constitution;  statutory  authority;  and  federal,  DoD  and Military Department acquisition regulations and/or supplements.  Contracting authority flows from Congress to the President, then to the SecDef, through the Service/Agency head, to the designated HCA, and then through the SCO to the Contingency Contracting Officer (CCO).  In many cases, it may not be until the COCO that both contracting authority and command authority meet. Figure 1.1.  Authority Flow Diagram.  1.3.1.1.  Contracting  Officer’s  Warrant.    Contracting  authority  is  explicitly  documented via  the  contracting  officer’s  warrant,  Standard  Form  (SF)  1402.    A  warrant  is  the document  that  authorizes  a  contracting  officer,  including  CCOs,  to  award  a  contract which  obligates  the  government  to  expend  funds  for  contracted  support  requirements.  Any  restrictions on a  contracting officer’s authority to  purchase items  will  be explicitly stated on the warrant.  The most common restriction is placed on the maximum amount a contracting officer is authorized to obligate per contract action. AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 7 1.3.1.1.1.  Other  Service/Agency.    AF  CCOs  may  accept  a  warrant  and  execute contracts on behalf of another Service/Agency if the CCO is assigned to/deployed in support of a joint organization. 1.3.1.1.2.  AF  CCOs  must  report  to  their  home  station  Air  Force  Installation Contracting  Agency  (AFICA)  Operating  Location  (OL)  or  Major  Command (MAJCOM)  Functional  Area  Manager  (FAM)  if  they  are  being  issued  a  warrant  by another Service/Agency when they are not part of a joint contracting organization. 1.3.1.2.  Contract  and  Contractual  Relationships.    A  contract  is  a  legally  binding agreement for supplies, services, and/or construction awarded by government contracting officers.  The contract is the only legal basis for the relationship between the DoD and the contractor.    The  contract  shall  specify  the  terms  and  conditions,  to  include  minimum acceptable  professional  standards;  performance  standards;  performance  and/or  delivery locations;  deployment,  reception,  and  redeployment  requirements  and  procedures; government-provided  services;  etc.   In  contingencies,  a  Geographic  Combatant Command  (GCC)  and/or  Joint  Task  Force  (JTF)  Fragmentary  Order  (FRAGO)  which issues  theater  policy  is  not  adequate  to  direct  contractors.    Those  policies  must  be included in provisions and clauses to ensure contractor compliance. 1.3.1.2.1.  Privity  of  Contract.    The  AF’s  contractual  relationship  is  with  the  prime contractor only.  However, many times a prime contractor will subcontract a portion of the effort to one or more subcontractors.  A CCO cannot engage directly with the subcontractor if they are not performing in accordance with the terms and conditions of  the  prime  contract.      The  prime  contractor  is  responsible  for  holding  the subcontractor  accountable  for  compliance  with  the  contract.    Therefore,  it  is imperative to subcontracts. the  appropriate  flow-down  requirements that  clauses  specify 1.3.1.2.2.  Implementation of Theater Policy for Contractors.  Since the contract is the only  legal  basis  for  the  relationship  between  the  DoD  and  the  contractor,  it  is imperative  that  GCC/JTF  policies  are  properly  incorporated  into  provisions  and clauses  included  into  all  theater,  external  and  systems  support  contracts  with performance in the Area of Responsibility (AOR)/Joint Operational Area (JOA).  The Theater  Business  Clearance  (TBC)  process  ensures  that  the  correct  provisions  and clauses are included in applicable contracts.  Since these provisions and clauses will apply  to  all  Service/Agency  contracts  with  performance  in  the  AOR/JOA,  OSD (AT&L)  Defense  Procurement  and  Acquisition  Policy  (DPAP)  is  the  approval authority.    DPAP  issues  all  policy  on  the  TBC  process,  which  will  be  discussed further in Chapter 8 of this AFI. 1.3.1.3.  Head of Contracting Activity (HCA).  The HCA is the official who has overall responsibility  for  managing  the  contracting  activity.    HCAs  do  not  typically  exercise command  authority  over  CCOs,  but  do  have  an  assigned  staff  responsible  for  issuing contracting  policy  and  developing  standardized  provisions  and  clauses.    Unlike  other Services, the AF only has one HCA and that is SAF/AQC.  However, many of the HCA functions  may  be  delegated  down  to  the  SCO  and  further  (see  AFFARS  Mandatory Procedure 5301.601(a)(i) HCA Matrix). 8 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 1.3.1.4.

The deputy to an SCO may exercise any SCO authority unless restricted in the FAR, as supplemented (e.g., individual authorized to execute a specific authority must be of a certain minimum grade/rank), or as specifically limited by the SCO. HQ AFICA  is  the  designated  SCO  for  Air  Force  Central  Command  (AFCENT) contracting units. Table 1.1.  Acquisition of Services.

SCCO  duties  and  responsibilities  may  also  be  performed  by  the  Deputy Director  of  Contracting,  Assistant  Director  of  Contracting,  and the  Technical Director/Assistant to the Director of Contracting, as well as the Director of Contracting at Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), Hanscom AFB, Hill AFB, and Robins AFB and the Deputy Director  of  Contracting,  Assistant  Director  of  Contracting,  and the  Technical Director/Assistant to the Director of Contracting at Eglin AFB, Hanscom AFB, Hill AFB, and Robins AFB. 1.3.1.6.  Contingency  Contracting  Officer  (CCO).    A  CCO  is  the  government  official, military  or  civilian,  with  the  legal  authority  to  enter  into,  administer,  and/or  terminate contracts.  The CCO is appointed in writing through a warrant (SF 1402). 1.3.2.  Command  Authority.    Command  authority  includes  the  responsibility  for  effectively using  available  resources  and  planning the  employment  of,  organizing,  directing, coordinating,  and  controlling  military  forces  for  the  accomplishment  of  assigned  missions.  Command authority does not include the authority to obligate funds or enter into contracts on behalf  of  the  USG.    GCCs  do  not  have  their  own  contracting  authority  and  receive contingency contracting support from Services/Agencies and the GCC’s subordinate Service components.    Additionally,  command  authority  does  not  include  the  authority  to  direct contractors or contractor personnel actions outside the terms and conditions of their contract.  However,  in  emergency  situations,  the  ranking  commander  may  direct  Contractors Authorized  to  Accompany  Forces  (CAAF)  and  non-CAAF  working  on  a  US  controlled facility,  to  take  Force  Protection  (FP)  or  temporary,  emergency  response  actions  not specifically  authorized  in  their  contract  as  long  as  those  actions  do  not  require  them  to perform inherently governmental responsibilities. 1.3.2.1.  Requiring  Activity.    A  requiring  activity  is  the  military  or  other  designated supported organization that is  responsible for the support function and/or mission being resourced through commercial/noncommercial means.  The requiring activity has specific requirements development responsibilities to include development of “acquisition ready” 10 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 contract  requirements  packages  and  support  to  the  contract  management  process  via technically  qualified  unit  contracting  officer  representatives  (CORs)  and  receiving officials. 1.3.2.2.  Contracting Officer Representative (COR).  The COR is an individual nominated by the requiring activity and appointed in writing by the CCO to perform specific technical and administrative functions.  Additionally, CORs serve as on-site technical managers assessing contractor performance against contract performance standards in accordance with the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).  AF policy, guidance, and templates for the nomination and appointment of CORs are found at AFFARS Mandatory Procedure (MP) 5301.602-2(d) (http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/af_afmc/affars/MP5301.602-2(d).htm#P-1_0).  In addition, COR responsibilities are set forth in DFARS Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 201.602-2 (http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/dfars/PGI%20201_6.htm#P19_243). 1.3.2.3.  Requirements  Approval  Authority  (RAA).    The  RAA  is  the  AF  level  of designated responsibility, in accordance with AFI 63-138, Acquisition of Services, Table 1.1, for approving service contract requirements prior to the formation of the acquisition strategy.    Requirements  are  approved  using  the  Requirements  Approval  Document (RAD)  and  follows  the  process  outlined  in  AFI  63-138,  Acquisitions  of  Services, paragraph 3.5.  It may be necessary to comply with the AF approval process and the joint validation  and/or  approval  process.    For  example,  if  the  Joint  Force  Commander  (JFC) establishes  a  Joint  Requirements  Review  Board  (JRRB)  for  contract  requirements  that will  have  performance  in  the  JFC’s  AOR/JOA,  the  AF  requiring  activity  must  submit contract requirements to the JRRB for validation/approval.  More information is available on the joint validation/approval process in Chapter 8, of this AFI. 1.3.2.4.  Services  Designated  Official  (SDO).    The  SDO  is  the  individual  designated  in accordance  with  10  USC  2330(b)  to  exercise  responsibility  for  the  management  of  the acquisition of services.  These responsibilities include certifying service acquisitions are performance-based  during  acquisition  strategy  formulation  and  approving,  in  advance, any  acquisition  that  is  not  performance-based.    The  SDO  is  determined  based  on  the Services  Category  (SCAT)  and  dollar  threshold  of  the  service  acquisition  as  defined  in AFI 63-138, Acquisition of Services, Table 1.1. 1.3.2.5.  Undue  Command  Influence.    Commanders  at  all  levels  must  avoid  improper command  influence,  or  perception  thereof,  on  the  contracting  process.    CCOs  must  be able  to  exercise  sound,  unbiased  business  judgment  and  contract  oversight.    CCOs responsibilities  include  safeguarding  the  interests  of  the  USG  and  ensuring  fair  and equitable  treatment  of  contractors.    In  order  to  perform  these  responsibilities,  CCOs should be allowed wide latitude to exercise business judgment. 1.3.2.6.  Unauthorized Commitments.  An unauthorized commitment is nonbinding solely because the government representative who made it lacked the authority to enter into that agreement, as explained in FAR 1.602-3.  Leaders at all levels should discourage unauthorized commitments.   If military or civilian personnel make commitments (without authority) to change existing contract terms or request contractors provide goods AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 11 or services which are not already under contract, they are subject to disciplinary action, regardless of rank, and  may be held personally liable. 1.3.2.7.  Ratification.  The process by which an official, who has the appropriate contracting authority, approves an unauthorized commitment to pay for supplies or services provided to the government.  Unauthorized commitments may be ratified if the conditions found in FAR 1.602-3(c) are satisfied. 1.4.  Inherently Governmental Functions. 1.4.1.  As  required  by  FAR  7.503(e)  and  DFARS  207.503,  requiring  activity  officials  must certify  in  writing  that  functions  to  be  contracted  (or  to  continue  to  be  contracted)  are  not inherently  governmental.  Requiring activity officials shall determine whether functions are inherently governmental based on the guidance in DoDI 1100.22, Guidance for Determining Workforce  Mix.    For  acquisition  functions,  the  contracting  officer  must  make  specific determinations  to  avoid  contractor  performance  of  inherently  governmental  functions  and prevent any potential organizational conflict of interest. 1.5.  Contingency Contracting Organizational Constructs. 1.5.1.  According to Joint Publication 4-10, Operational Contract Support, there are a number of  potential  contracting  organizational  options  to  include:    Service  Support  to  Self,  Lead Service for Contracting (LSC), Lead Service for contracting Coordination (LSCC) and Joint Theater Support Contracting Command (JTSCC). 1.5.1.1.  Service Support to Self.  Under this construct, the Component Headquarters and subordinate Air Expeditionary Wings (AEWs) retain operational  control  of their theater contracting  organizations  and  the  AF  HCA  retains  contracting  authority  (potentially through a designated SCO) for assigned AF CCOs.    An AF Expeditionary Contracting Squadron  (ECONS)  is  established  under  an  Expeditionary  Mission  Support  Group (EMSG)/AEW Commander 1.5.1.2.  Lead  Service  for  Contracting  (LSC).    The  GCC  may  designate  a  component, normally the lead Service responsible for most common user logistics (CUL) support, as the  LSC.    The  LSC  leads  theater  support  contracting  actions  which  are  tied  to  lead Service  common  user  logistics  or  the  most  capable  contracting  service  and/or assignments.    Additionally,  the  LSC  coordinates  common  contracting  actions  via  Joint Contracting  Support  Board  (JCSB);  assists  in  OCS  analysis  of  the  operational environment  effort.    LSC  is  most  applicable  to  small-scale,  long-term,  Service  centric phase I-III operations. 1.5.1.3.  Lead Service for Contracting Coordination (LSCC).  The GCC may designate a specific Service component  as the  LSCC responsible for coordinating common contract support via JCSB, if established.  Additionally, the LSCC assists in OCS analysis of the operational environment effort.  LSCC is applicable to phase 0-III small-scale, short-term operations. 1.5.1.4.  Joint  Theater  Support  Contracting  Command  (JTSCC).    The  JTSCC  is  a functionally  focused  JTF  with  C2,  normally  tactical  control,  and  contracting  authority over  contracting  personnel  assigned  and/or  organizations  attached  within  a  designated operational  area,  normally  a  JOA.    JTSCC  commands  theater  support  contracting; 12 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 coordinates common contracting actions in the joint operations area via JCSB and assists in OCS analysis of the operational environment.  JTSCC is most applicable in complex, large-scale phase IV operations. 1.5.1.4.1.  The JTSCC’s contracting authority is delegated by the Senior Procurement Executive  (SPE)  of  the  Service  component  designated  by  the  GCC  to  form  the nucleus  to  the  JTSCC.    Because  contracting  authority  is  not  resident  in  CCMD Service  components,  but  instead  provided  by  their  parent  Military  Departments, contracting  authority  arrangements  must  be  worked  out  as  part  of  the  planning process and as far in advance as practicable. 1.5.1.4.2.  The  JTSCC  manning  is  based  on  a  Joint  Manpower  Document  (JMD).  Each  Service’s  contribution  to  the  JTSCC  JMD  should  typically  be  proportional  to the percentage of each Services forces being supported in the operational area. 1.5.1.5.  Hybrid  Construct.    Depending  on  the  operation,  it  may  be  appropriate  to  use  a combination  of  the  aforementioned  constructs  to  balance  the  efficiencies  gained  from exercising directive authority for logistics (DAFL) and the effectiveness of decentralized execution.    It  is  possible  that  the  JFC  will  establish  a  JTSCC  to  do  contracting  for  key CUL  items  to  prevent  duplication  of  contracting  effort;  prevent  competition  for  limited commercial  resources;  and  implement  JOA-wide  standards.    At  the  same  time,  the  JFC may  designate  LSCs  supporting  the  designated  Base  Operations  Support-Integrator (BOS-I) at each contingency base/location.  In this situation the LSC would order off of JOA-wide  contracts than  developing  a  separate solicitation/contract at each base.  This is an example of enterprise-wide sourcing within the  operational  environment.    It  allows  the  GCC  to  execute  DAFL  but  also  allows Services to keep control over their contracting capabilities at the base level. for  key  CUL items rather 1.6.  Types of Contractors. 1.6.1.  Theater Support Contractors.   Theater support contracts are awarded by CCOs in the operational  area  serving  under  the  direct  contracting  authority  of  the  Service/Service component,  special  operations  force  command,  or  designated  JTSCC  HCA  for  the contingency  operation.    Local  contractors  supporting  a  contract  issued  by  an  AF  ECONS within the GCCs AOR are an example of theater support contractors. 1.6.2.  External  Support  Contractors.    External  support  contractor  are  awarded  from contracting  organizations  whose  contracting  authority  does  not  derive  directly  from  the theater support contracting HCA(s) or from systems support contracting authorities.  External support  contracts  are  executed  from  the  rear  and  provide  a  variety  of  logistics  and  other noncombat  related  services.    An  example  of  external  support  contractors  are  Air  Force Contract  Augmentation  Program  (AFCAP)  contractors.    AFCAP  task  orders  are  typically executed from Tyndall AFB, FL, but support contingency operations in a GCC’s AOR. 1.6.3.  Systems  Support  Contractors.  Systems  support contractor provide  technical  support, maintenance  and  in  some  cases,  repair  parts  for  selected  military  weapons  and  support systems,  such as aircraft and automated C2 systems.   Contractors typically  deploy  with  the system they support, may be part of a unit type code (UTC) package and when deployed are designated  CAAF.    The  associated  contracts  are  typically  issued  by  program  offices  within AFMC (e.g., AFLCMC, AFNWC, etc.) and AFPSC (SMC).  The Government is responsible AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 13 for  providing  support  to  these  contractors  as  specified  in  their  contract  and  the  extent  of support  may  vary  by  location.    Government  provided  support  may  be  extensive  in  non-permissive environments whereby the Government typically provides security, lodging, food, laundry  services,  etc.    An  example  of  systems  support  contractors  are  those  who  deploy  in support of the MQ-9. 1.7.  Legal Status of Contractors. 1.7.1.  Pursuant  to  applicable  law,  contracted  services  may  be  utilized  in  contingency operations  for  all  functions  not  considered  inherently  governmental.    Contractor  personnel may be utilized in support of operations in a non-combat role as long as contractor personnel residing with the force in foreign contingencies have been designated as CAAF by the force they  accompany  and  are  provided  with  an  appropriate  identification  card  pursuant  to  the Geneva  Convention  Relative  to  the  Treatment  of  Prisoners  of  War.    If  captured  during international  armed  conflict,  contractors  with  CAAF  status  are  entitled  to  prisoner  of  war status.  Some contractor personnel may be covered by the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War should they be captured during armed conflict. 1.7.1.1.  Local  and  Other-Country  Laws.   All  contractor  personnel  supporting contingency  operations  are  subject  to  international  agreements  and  must  comply  with applicable local  and other-country  laws.  Contractor personnel  may  be hired from U.S., local  national  (LN),  or  other-country  national  (OCN)  sources  and  their  status  may  be CAAF  or  non-CAAF,  depending  on  the  operational  environment  and  the  terms  of  their contract.    For example, U.S.   and OCN  contractors typically  operate in  CAAF status  in overseas  non-permissive  environments.    At  the  same  time,  LN  contractors,  with  the exception of interpreters and a few others, typically do not operate under CAAF status. 1.7.1.2.  U.S.  Laws.    CAAF,  with  some  exceptions,  are  subject  to  U.S.  laws  and Government regulations.  For example, all U.S. citizen and OCN CAAF may be subject to  prosecution  pursuant  to  Federal  law  including,  but  not  limited  to  The  Military Extraterritorial  Jurisdiction  Act  of  2000  (MEJA).    MEJA  extends  U.S.  Federal  criminal jurisdiction  to  certain  defense  contractor  personnel  for  offenses  committed  outside  U.S. Territory.  Additionally, CAAF are subject to prosecution pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  Other laws may allow prosecution of offenses by contractor personnel.  Immediate consultation with the servicing Judge Advocate (JA) office and the CO/CCO is required in all cases of suspected MEJA and/or UCMJ application to conduct by CAAF personnel, especially in non-combat operations or in undeclared contingencies. 1.8.  Funding Contingency Contract Support. 1.8.1.  Legislative Constraints.  Three key fiscal law constraints of purpose, time and amount still apply for contingency operations. 1.8.1.1.  Purpose.    Appropriations  shall  be  applied  only  to  the  objects  for  which  the appropriations  were  made  except  as  otherwise  provided  by  law  (31  U.S.C.    §  1301(a)).  Major  Appropriations  include:    Personnel  –  pay  and  allowances,  PCS,  etc.;  O&M  – operations  and  maintenance  of  installations,  day-to-day  expenses  of  training  exercises, deployments, etc.; Procurement – production and modification of aircraft, etc.; RDT&E – basic  and  applied  scientific  research,  etc.  and  MILCON  –  military  construction.  Congress does not specify every item of expenditure in an Appropriations Act.  Agencies 14 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 have reasonable discretion for expenditures which are reasonably necessary or contribute materially to the type of appropriation, not prohibited by law and not otherwise provided for in another appropriation. 1.8.1.2.  Time.    Appropriation  is  available  for  obligation  only  for  expenses  which  are  a Bona Fide Need of the period of availability for obligation.  (31 U.S.C.  § 1502(a)). Most appropriations  have  a  period  of  availability  or  specified  time  available  for  obligation.  Generally, appropriations are available for the following: O&M  – 1  year; Personnel – 1 year;  RDT&E  –  2  years;  Procurement  –  3  years  and  MILCON  –  5  years.    No  one  may obligate  before  appropriation  and  receipt  of  funds  and  funds  must  be  obligated  before they  expire.  Once obligated, disbursement of funds may  be made before or after funds expire but before they are closed.  Appropriations close five years after they expire. 1.8.1.2.1.  Exceptions.  Supplies can be purchased using the lead time and stock level exceptions;  however,  end  of  year  stockpiling  of  supplies  is  prohibited.    Severable services which do not exceed 12 months can cross fiscal years (10 U.S.C.  § 2410a).  Construction  need  must  arise  while  funds  are  available  for  obligation  and  must consider factors such as:  normal weather; required delivery date; when Government intends to make site available to the contractor and degree of control the Government has over when the contractor can begin work. 1.8.1.3.  Amount.  May not make or authorize an obligation or expenditure that exceeds an  amount  available  in  an  appropriation  or  fund  (31  U.S.C.    §  1341(a)(1)(A))  which includes expired appropriations. 1.8.2.  Emergency and Special Program (ESP) Codes. (as specified in AFI 65-601V1) apply to  most  appropriations.    Air  Force  activities  at  all  levels  assign  ESP  codes.    These  special accounting and reporting codes collect costs incurred during an emergency or in support of a special  program.    Periodically,  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  for  Financial Management  and  Comptroller  –  Budget  (SAF/FMB)  or  MAJCOMs  require  the  use  of specific ESP codes. 1.8.3.  Commanders  Emergency  Response  Program  (CERP).    The  CERP  was  designed  to enable local commanders in the operational area to respond to urgent humanitarian relief and reconstruction requirements by implementing programs that immediately help the indigenous population.    The  CERP  must  be  used  to  help  the  indigenous  population  without  direct  or indirect  benefit  to  the  United  States,  coalition,  or  other  supporting  military  personnel  (as specified in DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 12, Chapter 27).  CERP funds are typically used for small-scale, low-dollar, short term, employment-oriented, emergency, and high-visibility projects  that benefit the local  population.   CERP funds shall not  be commingled with  NAF and shall be separately executed, managed, recorded, and reported.  The local finance office can provide information on CERP funds in the CCO’s area. 1.8.4.  Certifying  Official.    Financial  Management  personnel  who  commit  funds  which contain  all  appropriation  information  to  include  any  ESP  codes  on  a  document  such  as Purchase Request (AF Form 9) and certify funds are available for obligation. 1.8.5.  Disbursing Official.  Financial Management personnel who authorize disbursement of funds most often through the payment of contract invoices. AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 15 1.8.6.  Paying Agents.  In circumstances where a Disbursing Official (DO), disbursing agent, or  a  cashier  are  not  available  for  payment,  check  cashing,  or  currency  conversion  service cannot be provided otherwise, the DO may request the commander to appoint a paying agent, who  makes  necessary  transactions  for  and  in  the  name  of  the  DO  form  funds  advanced  for that purpose.  Under normal circumstances, paying agents may not act as certifying officers or purchasing officers; escort officers serving as paying agents for expenses related to official travel may likewise not be purchasing officers.  Therefore, CCOs and field ordering officers (FOOs)  should  not  serve  as  paying  agents  to  ensure  adequate  checks  and  balances  are  in place to deter/prevent fraud. 1.9.  International Laws and Agreements. 1.9.1.  Planners and requiring activities, in  coordination with  contracting  officers, shall take international laws, local laws, and host nation support (HNS) agreements into account when planning  for  contracted  support,  through  assistance  and  coordination  with  the  Combatant Commander (CCDR) and Service component staff judge advocate (SJA) offices.  These laws and  support  agreements  may  affect  contracting  by  restricting  the  services  to  be  contracted, limiting contracted services to LN or HN contractor sources or, in some cases, by prohibiting contractor use altogether. 1.9.1.1.  Status  of  Forces  Agreements  (SOFAs).    All  AF  component  planners  and requiring  activities,  in  coordination  with  designated  contracting  organization,  shall review  applicable SOFAs and related  agreements to  determine their  effect  on the status and  use  of  contractors  in  support  of  applicable  contingency  operations,  with  the assistance and coordination of the geographic CCDR SJA offices. 1.9.1.2.  Host Nation Support Agreements (HNSA).  Planners and requiring activities, in coordination  with  contracting  officers  shall  review  applicable  support  agreements  to determine  their  effect  on  the  status  and  use  of  contractors  in  support  of  applicable contingency  operations,  with  the  assistance  and  coordination  of  the  geographic  CCDR SJA offices. 1.9.1.3.  Acquisition Cross-Service Agreement (ACSA).   ACSAs allow military forces to acquire logistics support, supplies, and services directly from or provide them to a foreign government  of organization (such as NATO or  UN).  Such logistics support “transfers” come  into  play  primarily  during  wartime,  combined  exercises,  training,  deployments, contingency  operations,  humanitarian  or  foreign  disaster  relief  operations,  certain  peace operations  under  the  UN  Charter,  or  for  unforeseen  or  exigent  circumstances.      As  a result, ACSA authority is almost always exercised by the Unified Combatant Commands.  There  must  usually  be  a  cross-servicing  agreement  and  implementing  arrangements, negotiated  in  accordance  with  authority  delegated  by  DoD  Directive  2010.9,  to implement  proposed  transfers.      Until  such  an  agreement  has  been  signed,  logistics support, supplies, and services may be acquired from the nation or NATO entity, but not transferred  to  it.    Compensation  for  acquisitions  or  transfers  under  these  arrangements may  be  either  on  a  cost-reimbursement  basis  or  by  exchange  of  supplies  or  services  of equal value.  These agreements establish principles and provisions for effecting required support,  but  do  not  bind  either  party  to  any  particular  monetary  value  or  number  of transactions.   Air  Force  follows  AFI  25-301,  Acquisition  and  Cross-servicing Agreements. 16 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 1.10.  Small Business. 1.10.1.  Addressing  the  Applicability  of  Small  Business  Regulations  Outside  the  United States Section 1631(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, Pub. L. No. 112-239 (FY 2013 NDAA), the SBA issued a final rule amending its regulations at 13 CFR 125.2 to clarify that overseas contracting is not excluded. 1.10.2.  CCOs will review FAR (Part 19) for regulatory guidance (i.e., the ability to use set-asides) to maximize opportunities for small businesses overseas. 1.11.  Ethics and Integrity. 1.11.1.  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  for  Fiscal,  Ethics  &  Administrative  Law Office  (SAF/GCA)  provides  ethics  leadership  to  all  Air  Force  personnel  through  training, education and case specific guidance, offering legal advice to ensure public confidence in the integrity of government officials. 1.11.2.  Fraud,  Waste  and  Abuse  (FWA).    Fraud  is  any  intentional  deception  designed  to unlawfully  deprive  the  United  States  of  something  of  value  or  to  secure  from  the  United States for an individual a benefit, privilege, allowance, or consideration to which he or she is not  entitled.    Waste  is  the  extravagant,  careless,  or  needless  expenditure  of  government funds,  or  the  consumption  of  government  property  that  results  from  deficient  practices, systems,  controls,  or  decisions.    Abuse  is  the  intentional  or  improper  use  of  government resources  that  can  include  the  excessive  or  improper  use  of  one's  position,  in  a  manner contrary to its rightful or legally intended use. 1.11.2.1.  Reporting  FWA  is  accomplished  through  supervisors,  commanders,  the  IG Complaints  Resolution  Process  via  the  AF  Form  102,  Inspector  General  Personal  and Fraud,  Waste  &  Abuse  Complaint  Registration  or  DoD/AF/MAJCOM/  base  FWA Hotline phone numbers or email: usaf.ighotline@mail.mil 1.11.2.1.1.  The  AF  FWA  Hotline  is  (202)  404-5354  or  (800)  538-8492  or  FAX:  (202) 404-5429.  The DoD FWA Hotline is (800) 424-9098. 1.11.3.  Conflicts of Interest.  18 USC § 208, prohibits government employees from working on an assignment in some situations.  Specifically, this law says that a government employee may  not  work  on  an  assignment  that  will  affect  their  financial  interests  or  the  financial interests of their spouse or minor child.  The prohibition also applies if the assignment will affect  the  financial  interests  of  the  government  employee’s  general  partner,  or  of  an organization  where  they  serve  as  an  officer,  director,  employee,  general  partner,  or  trustee and  affect  the  financial  interests  of  someone  with  whom  they  have  an  arrangement  for employment, or with whom they are negotiating for employment. 1.11.4.  Trafficking  in  Persons.    DoD  Directive  2200.01  Combat  Trafficking  in  Persons (CTIP) establishes policy to oppose prostitution, forced labor, and any related activities that may contribute to the phenomenon of TIP; deter activities of DoD Service members, civilian employees,  indirect  hires,  contract  personnel,  and  command-sponsored  dependents  that would facilitate or support TIP; educate all Service members and DoD civilians annually on the  worldwide  trafficking  menace,  national  TIP  policy,  overseas  theater  TIP  policy,  and attendant  personal  responsibilities  consistent  with  DoD  core  values  and  ethical  standards; increase  efforts  by  commanders  and  military  police  worldwide,  within  their  authorities,  to AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 17 pursue indicators of TIP in  commercial  establishments patronized by  DoD personnel,  place offending establishments off-limits, and provide support to host-country authorities involved in  the  battle  against  TIP;  incorporate  provisions  in  service  contracts  that  support  the  DoD mission overseas to prohibit DoD contractors, other Federal agency or provisional authority contractors,  subcontractors  at  all  tiers,  and  their  employees  from  conducting  activities  that support or promote TIP; impose suitable penalties on those who fail to abide by U.S. law and on  those  who  fail  to  monitor  their  employees’  actions  for  compliance  with  U.S.  law  and incorporate  anti-TIP  and  TIP-protection  measures  for  vulnerable  populations,  in  particular for women and children, into post-conflict and humanitarian emergency assistance programs. 18 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

General. 3.1.1.  Contracting  training  provides  initial  and  recurring  proficiency  skills  needed  by contracting  professionals  to  perform  duties  in  their  primary  AFSC  or  civilian  job  series.  Training  and  exercising  contingency  contracting  skills,  which  are  not  normally  integrated into  peacetime  operations,  is  particularly  critical  to  CCOs  and  requires  special  leadership attention.    Commanders  and  supervisors  must  support  training  and  exercises  which  are necessary to develop and maintain CCO skills, especially those required to support bare base operations.  Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) are published on e-Pubs for enlisted, officer and civilian contracting members.  Commanders and supervisors will review and  comply  with  the  appropriate  CFETP  when  developing  training  and  education  plans  for contracting professionals. 3.2.  Standardized CCO Training. 3.2.1.  All Air Force contracting units will follow SAF/AQC policies for CCO training found on SharePoint Contracting (https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afcc/Pages/Default.aspx) (T-1) Central the Air Force 3.3.  Contracting Component Planner/FAM Training. 3.3.1.  Contracting members require additional training to ensure they are prepared for their role  as  a  component  planner  and/or  component  FAM.    They  must  be  very  experienced contracting members who also have an understanding of the AF and joint planning processes, the Global Force Management (GFM) process, and the OCS process. 3.3.2.  Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution System (DCAPES).  Contracting component  planners  serving  as  component  FAMs  are  required  to  attend  the  DCAPES Functional  Training  course.    This  course  teaches  planners  how  to  use  the  DCAPES applications with the understanding that the student is aware of the planning processes. 3.3.3.  FAM Web-Based Training (WBT) Course.  FAMs are required to take the AF FAM WBT within 3 months of assignment as a FAM.  The FAM WBT provides an understanding of  the  duties,  responsibilities,  systems,  tools,  and  processes  associated  with  the  position  of FAM. 3.3.4.  Joint OCS Planning and Execution Course (JOPEC).  Contracting component planners and component FAMs are highly encouraged to attend JOPEC.  This course develops skills and provides the knowledge for OCS staff to provide planning and execution support across the range of military operations at the GCC, JTF and Service component levels.  The course focuses on OCS staff responsibilities and tasks for phases 0 through 5. 3.3.5.  AF  Contingency  Wartime  Planning  Course  (CWPC).    This  course  is  highly recommended for all new FAMs.  CWPC provides instruction on the basic planning process for  war  planners  at  all  levels.    The  depth  of  instruction  is  sufficient  to  bring  students  to  a level  of  comprehension  that  enables  them  to  carry  out  their  duties  more  effectively  and decrease the steep learning curve associated with war planning. 26 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 3.3.6.  Advanced  CCO  Course  (CON  334).    Contracting  component  planners  are  highly encouraged  to  attend  CON  334.    This  Defense  Acquisition  University  (DAU)  course develops  skills  for  members  who  will  be  planning  and/or  executing  the  contingency contracting support provided to Joint Forces across the full spectrum of military operations. 3.4.  COR Training.  (T-0) 3.4.1.  Phase 1 – DoD Standardized COR Training and Certification.  DoD has established a COR  certification  standard,  which  defines  minimum  COR  competencies,  training  and experience  according  to  the  nature  and  complexity  of  the  requirement  and  contract performance risk.  The policy and training standards are published in OUSD (AT&L) Memo, DoD Standard for Certification of Contracting Officer’s Representatives (COR) for Service Acquisitions, 29 March 2010.  IAW MP 5301.302-(2) (d), as part of acquisition planning, the CCO must determine the nature of the work/requirement to determine if a COR or multiple CORs  are  required  to  assist  in  the  administration  of  a  contract.    The  nature  or  types  of work/requirement are: 3.4.1.1.  Type A.  Contracts that are fixed-price with low performance risk requirements; 3.4.1.2.  Type  B. requirements; and   Contracts  other  than  fixed-price  with  low  performance  risk 3.4.1.3.  Type  C.    Contracts  with  unique  requirements  that  necessitate  a  professional license, higher education, or specialized training. 3.4.1.4.  If  the  CCO  designates  Department  of  State  personnel  as  CORs  there  is  an additional procedure to be followed found at DFARS PGI 201-6. 3.4.2.  Phase  2  –  CCO  and  QAPC  Led  Training.    CCOs  and/or  QAPC  must  ensure  CORs receive  contract  specific  training  (to  include  refresher  training).    The  training  must  be provided  prior  to  contract  award  or  the  COR  assuming  contract  oversight  responsibilities when replacing another COR. 3.4.2.1.  The  QAPC  (or  CCO  if  no  QAPC)  will  provide  Phase  2  training  covering  the following: 3.4.2.1.1.  COR duties/responsibilities to be delegated; 3.4.2.1.2.  Multi-Functional  Team responsibilities; (MFT)  members and their roles and 3.4.2.1.3.  Importance of COR performance; 3.4.2.1.4.  Personal conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest; 3.4.2.1.5.  Unauthorized commitments; 3.4.2.1.6.  Ethics/integrity  in  relationships  with  the  CCO,  COR  management  (e.g.  Supervisor, Functional Commander/Directors (FC/FD)), and the contractor; and 3.4.2.1.7.  The  Seven  Step  Service  Acquisition  Process  which  can  be  found  at http://sam.dau.mil/. 3.4.2.2.  The CCO will provide Phase 2 training covering the following: AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 27 3.4.2.2.1.  A  discussion  of  the  contract,  performance  work  statement,  and  quality assurance surveillance plan; 3.4.2.2.2.  An awareness of any areas in the contract susceptible to fraud, waste, and abuse; and, 3.4.2.2.3.  Creation,  maintenance,  and  submission  of  all  quality  assurance documentation  and  contractor  performance  assessment  information  required  by  the contract and applicable regulations. 3.4.2.2.4.  CCOs  can  tailor  training  to  their  acquisition  and  can  find  a  template  at: (https://cs.eis.af.mil/airforcecontracting/knowledge_center/templates/suggested_contract-specific_training_syllabus.pdf). 3.5.  Customer/Requiring Activity Training.  (T-2)   3.5.1.  The  contracting  activity  will  train  non-contracting  personnel  designated  to  support contingency  plans  on  the  proper  use  of  ordering  instruments,  SF  44,  Government  Purchase Cards, and other decentralized procedures authorized for use and tailored to the contingency requirement. 3.6.  Exercise Support. 3.6.1.  Base Level Exercises.  Contracting will participate in base and Installation Emergency Management  Plan  (IEMP)  exercises  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  to  ensure  CCOs  are familiar  with  deployment  and  employment  processes.    For  employment  focused  exercises, contracting  commanders  will  ensure  that  the  Master  Scenario  Events  List  (MSEL)  include contracting injects  that  will exercise CCO skills in  addition  to  base processes.   If unable to exercise CCO skills as part of base-level exercises, contracting commanders should conduct individual  contracting  unit  exercises  with  specific  scenarios  to  prepare  CCOs  for environments/situations they will likely encounter in support of a contingency. 3.6.2.  Joint Exercises.  AFICA and unit commanders will participate in joint exercises to the maximum  extent  possible  and  ensure  MSEL  injects  properly  exercise  both  contracting coordination  and  contingency  contracting  execution  capabilities.    Contracting  planners should  consider  impacts  contracting  can  have  on  the  JFC’s  mission  such  as  inadvertently funding  insurgents,  flooding  the  economy  with  the  US  dollar,  destabilizing  labor  markets, etc.    These  impacts  should  be  given  to  OCS  planners  to  ensure  they  are  considered  in  the MESL. 3.6.2.1.  Depending  on  funding  availability,  AF  contracting  may  participate  in  or  even lead an OCS Joint Exercise (OCSJX).  AFICA will serve as the AF contracting lead unit for planning and executing OCSJXs.  The AFICA/CC will designate an O-6 to serve as the AF  contracting lead, typically, the AFICA OL SCO responsible for the AOR in  the exercise  scenario.    AFICA  will  augment  the  AFICA  OL  SCO  with  personnel  to  help carry out the AF contracting exercise planning and execution responsibilities. 3.6.2.2.  AF  contracting  units  will  participate  in  Chairman  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (CJCS) approved exercises.  AF component planners will include contingency contracting injects into exercise MSELs and assist OCS planners with their review of MSELs. 28 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 Chapter 4 EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS 4.1.  Contingency Kits. 4.1.1.  Each  operational  contracting  organization  shall  maintain  sufficient  supplies  and equipment to provide quick reaction contracting support for deployment taskings and/or local contingencies.    Unless  otherwise  indicated,  consumable  items  such  as  supplies  and  forms should be in sufficient quantity to operate for a 30-day period. 4.1.2.  As  tasked  within  their  DOC  Statements,  contracting  activities  will  develop  local support plans and kits with contracting supplies, forms, instructions, and office equipment to respond to contingency situations. 4.1.3.  Each  contracting  activity  must  develop  and  maintain  deployment  kits  for  use  during contingencies.    Unit  kits  will  be  pre-assembled  and  positioned  for  rapid  retrieval  and transport.  Kits will be inventoried on an annual basis.  Kits must also be inspected prior to and  upon  return  from  all  deployments.    Kit  inspection  results  must  be  documented  and maintained  for  a  minimum  of  one  year.    Contents  will  be  updated  periodically  to  replace outdated  material.    Mission  Capability  (MISCAP)  Statements  for  contracting  UTCs  are published  in  the  War  Mobilization  Plan,  Volume  3,  Part  3  and  contain  logistics  details (LOGDET).    Unit  deployment  kits  may  be  tailored  to  the  expected  deployment  location  or expected  emergency  tasking,  but  they  must  not  exceed  the  size  and  weight  limitations established  in  the  Joint  Operations  Planning  and  Execution  System  (JOPES)  Type  Unit Characteristics (TUCHA) file, the Standard UTC Reference File (SURF), and LOGDET for the appropriate UTC. 4.1.4.  Contracting  Incident  Response  Kits  (CIRKs).    To  ensure  contingency  contracting support  during  execution  of  Local  Incident  Response  Plans,  each  contracting  squadron  will augment in  Attachment  2.  The  Squadron Commander/Chief of Contracting should consider positioning at least one of the CIRKs/KTs outside  the  squadron’s  main  facility  or  at  an  off-base  site.

The  Department  of Defense  (DoD)  Contracting  Officer  Representative  Tracking  (CORT)  Tool  is  a  web management  capability  for  the  appointment  of  CORs  and  is  available  through  Wide  Area Work  Flow  (WAWF)  at  https://wawf.eb.mil/.    This  Tool  allows  a  perspective  COR,  COR Supervisor and Contracting Officer to electronically process nomination of CORs for one or multiple  contracts.    It  provides  built  in  workflows  for  the  nomination  process  to  include 30 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 email alerts/status reminders for monthly status report due-ins and delinquencies.  The CORT Tool provides contracting personnel and requiring activities the means to track and manage COR assignments for multiple contracts across DoD.  CORT Tool also identifies all training to  be  completed  by  the  COR  based  on  the  type/complexity  of  contract  (Type  A/B/C)  to  be administered and includes basic and refresher training requirements. 4.5.  Other Contingency Systems/Tools 4.5.1.  ACSA Global Automated Tracking and Reporting System (AGATRS).  An automated tool  that  tracks  and  provides  visibility  into  worldwide  Acquisition  Cross-Servicing Agreements  (ACSAs).    It  is  the  DoD  system  of  record  to  manage  ACSA  transactions  for logistics support, supply, and services (LSSS).  ACSA transactions that are used in support of a declared contingency or non-combat operation are required to be documented and tracked in AGATRS in accordance with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 2120.01C.  This  system  also  serves  as  the  worldwide  library  for  ACSAs  and  their  associated International Agreements (IAs).  AGATRS provides visibility into available ACSAs can be leveraged to obtain LSSS to sustain forces during contingencies and operations. AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 31 Chapter 5 CONTRACTING READINESS AND TASKING PROCESS 5.1.  UTC Information and Capabilities. 5.1.1.  Contracting  maintains  11  UTCs  of  various  personnel  and  equipment  capabilities designed  to  provide  full  spectrum  support  for  worldwide  contingencies.    Eleven  packages (XFFK1/2/3/5/6/7/8/9/D/E/L)  are  comprised  of  personnel  with  delegated  contracting authority to negotiate, administer, and terminate contracts during contingency operations on behalf of the Government (see Table 5.1).  These UTCs differ in number of personnel, grade and/or skill level, and Acquisition Professional Development Program (APDP) certifications, and may be employed individually or in groups in an effort to meet the required contracting support  and  experience  level.    The  equipment  UTCs  supplement  the  personnel  UTCs,  and provide a range of support (e.g. advance echelon team, bare base bed-down, sustainment, and reconstitution) to collocated operating bases and geographically separated units. 5.1.2.  Joint  Individual  Augmentation  (JIA)  taskings.    To  meet  this  need,  AF  contracting assets are postured in one of the eight single-airman force packages:  XFFK3/6/7/8/9/D/E/L.  This  posturing  concept,  although  not  ideal  to  AF-centric  deployments  and  concepts  of operation,  has  allowed  the  greatest  flexibility  in  matching  AF  contracting  capability  with Joint Manning Document Individual Augmentation (JMD/IA) requirements. Table 5.1.  UTCs. 5.2.  UTC and Capabilities Alignment. 5.2.1.  All active duty XFFK Series UTCs will be postured as follows: 5.2.1.1.  Institutional Contracting Forces.  Institutional force (IF) in Tempo Band “X” of the  AEF  construct.    IF  represents  the  AF’s  sustainment  capability  necessary  to  meet  32 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 SECAF  Title  10  functions  (i.e.  organize,  train,  equip,  recruit,  supply,  etc.)  and  includes personnel  working  above  Wing-level,  instructors,  Space  and  Missile  System  Center, National Reconnaissance Office and personnel assigned to AFMC. 5.2.1.2.  Operational Contracting Forces.  Operational force (OPLN) in Tempo Band “E” of the AEF construct. 5.3.  Contracting Readiness. 5.3.1.  AEF  UTC  Reporting  Tool  (ART).    A  classified,  web-based  automated  database  to support collection, collation, and report generation of unit and aggregate UTC readiness data. Units  that  have  standard  UTCs  postured  in  UTC  Availability  (UTA)  view  and  report  their UTC status within the ART application. 5.3.2.  Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS).  In accordance with Title 10 USC §117 requirements,  the  Secretary  of  Defense  (SECDEF)  established  DRRS  as  the  sole  readiness reporting system for the Department of Defense. 5.3.2.1.  As  such,  DRRS  is  used  by  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  (OSD), Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (CJCS),  Combatant  Commands  (CCMDs), Services, and Combat Support Agencies. 5.3.2.2.  DRRS is a single automated reporting system within the DoD functioning as the central  registry  of  all  operational  units  in  the  US  Armed  Forces  and  designated  foreign organizations. 5.3.2.3.  DRRS  provides  objective  data  critical  to  crisis  planning,  the  contingency  and peacetime  planning  processes,  while  also  establishing  a  subjective  capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness reporting system for the DoD to measure the readiness of military units to meet missions and goals assigned by the SECDEF. 5.3.2.4.  DRRS  is  used  by  the  Chief  of  Staff  United  States  Air  Force  (CSAF)  and subordinate  commanders  in  assessing  their  effectiveness  in  meeting  Title  10  USC responsibilities to organize, train, and equip forces for CCMDs. 5.3.2.5.  In addition, DRRS data is used by other joint automated systems. 5.3.2.5.1.  Examples  are  the  Integrated  Development  Environment  (IDE)  /  Global Transportation  Network  (GTN),  Joint  Operation  Planning  and  Execution  System (JOPES),  National  Military  Command  Center  (NMCC)  Command  and  Control System, and the Nuclear Planning and Execution System. 5.3.3.  Unit Deployment Manager (UDM).  Roles and responsibilities are covered in AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution.  Some of these responsibilities include: 5.3.3.1.  Acting  as training  manager  (UTM), flight/squadron  leadership  and  wing  training  functions  regarding  deployment  related issues. the  primary the  unit liaison to 5.3.3.2.  Performs UTC development duties. 5.3.3.3.  Assigns and maintains functional UTCs as postured by MAJCOM FAMs. 5.3.3.4.  Executes and coordinates TPFDD deployment taskings. AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 33 5.3.4.  Unit  Training  Managers  (UTM).    Roles  and  responsibilities  are  covered  in  AFI  10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution.  Some of these responsibilities include: 5.3.4.1.  Manage unit’s training programs, policies and procedures. 5.3.4.2.  Coordinate  with  UDM  and  flight  superintendent(s)  to  schedule  and  manage required deployment training. 5.3.4.3.  Ensure Upgrade Training Records (UGT) are up to date for deploying members in the grade of E-6 and below and for E-7s and above who are in upgrade training status. 5.4.  Tasking CCOs. 5.4.1.  IF  are  not  postured  in  UTA  by  UTC;  personnel  are  identified  for  taskings  using MILPDS. 5.4.2.  OPLN are postured in UTA by UTC; personnel are identified for taskings using ART and MILPDS. 34 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 Chapter 6 CONTINGENCY PLANNING 6.1.  General. 6.1.1.  Since  contingency  contracting  is  part  of  the  much  broader  multi-functional  OCS process,  it  must  be  planned  with  consideration  of  the  other  elements  of  OCS.    It  is  very difficult to plan for contingency contracting execution without consideration for how contract support  requirements  will  be  managed.    Consideration  include:    BOS-I  responsibilities, contract management responsibilities retained by the AF regardless of BOS-I and integration of contract support into the military planning process. 6.2.  Plan Development. 6.2.1.  If  combatant  and  subordinate  joint  force  commanders  (JFCs)  determine  contracted support  capabilities  are  appropriate  in  support  of  a  contingency,  military  planners  will  plan for  such  support  in  their  functional  annexes  and  Annex  W,  which  consists  of  the  contract support integration plan (CSIP) and the Contractor Management Plan (CMP).  Planners will develop orchestrated, synchronized and fully developed CSIPs and CMPs as components of concept  plans  (CONPLANs)  and  operational  plans  (OPLANs),  in  accordance  with appropriate  strategic  planning  guidance.    CONPLANS  without  time-phased  force  and deployment data (TPFDD) and operational orders (OPORDs) shall contain CSIP- and CMP-like guidance to the extent necessary as determined by the CCDR.  AF component planners will  develop  appropriate  supporting  plans.    These  supporting  plans  must  address  the following considerations when operations will involve the use of contract support.  This list is  not  all-inclusive  and  the  level  of  detail  may  vary  depending  on  the  type  of  plan  and  the type, size, and complexity of the operation. 6.2.1.1.  Functional Annexes.  Functional annexes should address: 6.2.1.2.  Functional  tasks/contract  requirements  that  will  be  performed  by  contract support; 6.2.1.3.  Rough  order  of  magnitude  of  the  level  of  contract  support  to  include locations/geographic areas to be supported; 6.2.1.4.  Whether functional contract support will be performed by CAAF (US and OCN contractors) or local nationals (LNs); 6.2.1.5.  Results  of  expeditionary  site  surveys/market  analysis  conducted  to  confirm viable commercial markets  and  government  and  security  conditions  exist to  support the use  of  LN  contract  support.    When  conducting  site  surveys,  functional  planners  will consider: 6.2.1.5.1.  Extent  of  potential  commercial  sources  available  to  meet  contract requirements; 6.2.1.5.2.  Vendor ties to potential bad actors/terrorist groups as identified by Security Forces, OSI and/or other intelligence organizations; AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 35 6.2.1.5.3.  Security  environment  to  include  Security  Forces,  OSI  and/or  other intelligence  organization’s  ability  to  properly  vet  local  contractors  prior  to  allowing base access; 6.2.1.5.4.  Functional communities’ ability to provide adequate number of escorts for local contractors if required for security reasons; and 6.2.1.5.5.  Potential  for  host  Government availability of local commercial support for U.S. forces. to  nationalize  assets thus limiting 6.2.1.6.  HNS  agreements,  ACSA,  and  Military  logistics  support  agreements  which ultimately  affect  the  extent  of  contract  support  required  and  potential  payment  for contract support received. 6.2.1.7.  Contracting  issues  regarding  safety  requirements  shall  be  coordinated  with  the appropriate safety office (AFFOR/SE, MAJCOM/SE, etc.). 6.2.2.  Annex W.  A copy of the Contingency Contracting Planning Checklist to support the drafting following  website:  http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/ccap/cc/jcchb/Contingency%20Contracting%20Planning%20Checklist.pdf. of  Annex  W) found the can be at 6.2.2.1.  Annex  W  consists  of  both  the  CSIP  and  the  CMP  which  include  inputs  from three types of functional planners: 6.2.2.1.1.  Requirements management to include structure and processes; 6.2.2.1.2.  Contingency contracting; and 6.2.2.1.3.  Contractor performance oversight and support. 6.2.2.2.  The  CSIP  addresses  processes/structure  used  to  integrate  contract  support  into joint operations and the CMP addresses processes/structure used to develop policies and contract provisions/clauses to ensure contractor performance oversight and support. the  BOS-Integrator 6.2.3.  Base  Operations  Support  (BOS)  Requirements.    In  accordance  with  DoDD  3000.10, Contingency Basing Outside the United States, the GCC will designate a Service component as temporary/semi-permanent  contingency base/location.  When the AF Component is designated as the BOS-I for a contingency base, the supporting plan must address processes for supporting this designation and managing, to include validating and prioritizing, BOS requirements. for  every (BOS-I) 6.2.4.  Centrally-Managed Supplies/Service Requirements.  In some cases, the JFC may task a  Service  component/CSA  to  centrally  manage  specific  commodity/service  contract requirements  for  all  components  to  prevent  duplication  of  effort,  prioritize  limited  assets, centralize  control,  and/or  to  establish  JOA-wide  standards.    For  example,  theater-wide trucking,  information  operations,  security  services  (static  and  convoy),  food  services,  food, water,  fuel,  power  generation/generators,  etc.  may  be  candidates  to  be  centrally  managed.  The Service component/CSA designated to centrally manage a requirement will also provide the  contracting  support  for  procuring  that  supply/service.    Centrally-managed  requirements provide a means for GCCs to exercise Directive Authority for Logistics (DAFL) which can limit duplication of effort, enforce standardization and take advantage of economies of scale. 36 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 6.2.5.  MILCON Requirements.  AF component will address process for managing MILCON requirements  and  submission  through  the  AFFOR  staff,  to  the  Joint  Facilities  Utilization Board  (JFUB)  for  validation/prioritization  and  then  execute  in  accordance  with  DoD Directive 4270.5, Military Construction. 6.2.6.  Requirements  Validation  and  Prioritization  Process.    AF  component  supporting  plan for submitting requirements to and supporting the Joint Requirements Review Board (JRRB) and the Joint Facilities Utilization Board (JFUB); 6.2.7.  Requirements  Funding  Process.    AF  component  supporting  plan  should  address process for funding requirements.  Funding may be centrally controlled and prioritized at the JTF level or decentralized with Service components funding their requirements.  In addition, the plan should address use of any type of special funding such as CERP. 6.2.8.  Contracting Structure/Capabilities.  Annex W must identify the contracting structure.  The choice of structure depends on the common user logistics (CUL), BOS-I, estimated OCS requirements  and  contracting  activities  capability.    The  doctrinal  contracting  structure  as indicated in chapter 1 of this AFI are: service support to self, LSCC, LSC, JTSCC or a hybrid of these constructs. 6.2.8.1.  The structure is determined in the Annex W, but how the AF component intends to support that structure should be provided in a supporting appendix to Annex W. 6.2.8.2.  Even  though  this  AFI  states  that  the  GCC  determines  the  contracting organizational  structure,  the  contracting  authority  required  for  these  constructs  to  work effectively  is  a  Service  authority  that  does  not  reside  with  the  GCC.    Therefore,  AF component  planners  developing  supporting  plans  or  reviewing  any  GCC  plans  that require  the  AF  to  give  up  or  assume  contracting  authority  for  other  Services/agencies, must  coordinate  those  plans  with  the  effected  SCO  as  well  as  the  SAF/AQC.    Any   disagreement between Services on contracting authority must be elevated to OSD DPAP for final decision/resolution.   Taskings  should  consider  the  contracting 6.2.9.  Appropriate  contingency  taskings. manpower  required  for  the  expected  base  configuration,  population,  geographic  location, joint  usage arrangements and local  market  conditions  ability to  support the mission.  Other considerations can include: 6.2.9.1.  Current MISCAP and AEF rotation schedule. 6.2.9.2.  Allocation  of  contracting-related  UTC  packages  within  the  OPLAN  and coordination  of  timing  for  each  package  within  the  TPFDD.    Plans  shall  call  for  early arrival  of  contracting  personnel  to  provide  contracting  support  for  bed  down  of  initial forces arriving at the deployment site. 6.2.9.3.  Adequacy  of  contracting  resources  tasked  from  all  sources  to  meet  the  total contingency contracting requirements for all units at the deployment base. 6.2.9.4.  Individual  Mobilization  Augmentee  (IMA)  availability  to  support  OPLAN taskings or to backfill deployed active duty CCOs. 6.2.9.5.  Equipment  and  personnel  support  requirements  for  the  CCO  portion  of  each OPLAN telephone,  other communication, transportation, and office equipment). laptop  computers,  printer,  cellular (Fax  machine, AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 37 6.2.10.  Procedures for functional areas to identify personnel at the deployment site who can validate/approve  requirements,  accept  deliveries  and  confirm  that  goods/services  received comply with contract specifications. 6.2.11.  Coordination  of  contracting  and  finance  functions  to  ensure  paying  agents  are designated to support the contracting activity. 6.2.12.  Uniform  and  civilian  clothing  requirements  for  each  deployment  location  and initiation  of  uniform  allowance  documents  for  enlisted  personnel, if  applicable.  Authorization for use of civilian clothing shall be specified on TDY orders and in compliance with use according to appropriate personnel and finance regulations. 6.2.13.  Special  personnel  requirements  for  location-specific  limitations  to  gender,  rank,  or other cultural factors which affect contracting within the deployment area. 6.2.14.  Contracting  interface  with  the  supply  system  at  the  deployment  site  to  avoid duplication  of  effort,  unnecessary  administrative  steps,  and  unnecessary  local  purchase  of supply system items. 6.2.15.  Potential adverse impact on unit mission support due to FAR or statutory contracting restrictions  and  any  deviations  that  may  be  necessary  to  meet  unique  unit  mission requirements at the deployment site. 6.2.16.  Contracting  interface  with  24-hour  emergency  operations  contact  points  and purchasing sources in the deployment area. 6.2.17.  Impact  on  contracting  effectiveness  during  chemical,  biological,  or  nuclear operations, if applicable. 6.2.18.  Possible  additional  duty  taskings  at  various  stages  of  the  deployment  that  may interfere with contracting duties. 6.2.19.  Security  and  protection  needed  during  the  deployment  and  any  requirement  for CCOs to carry weapons. 6.2.20.  Plan taskings that might result in possible CCO conflicts of interest situations (e.g., funds disbursement or acceptance of goods). 6.2.21.  Reporting  and  documentation  requirements  for  all  stages  of  the  deployment  and adequate administrative and documentation support for the operation. 6.2.22.  Taskings  for  contract  closeout,  termination,  claim  processing,  and  disposition  of purchased USAF assets. 6.2.23.  Procedures  for  preserving  lessons  learned  and  disseminating  the  information collected from after-action reports to parent Component Headquarters. 6.2.24.  For  AFICA/K_  (OL-supported  MAJCOM  Director  of  Contracting)  or  FAMs  only evaluate  supplemental  force  package  requirements  required  to  support  the  deployed  central contracting  function  and  assist  with  the  bed  down  of  arriving  units  in  the  theater  of operations.    Place  these  packages  in  the  TPFDD  early  enough  to  meet  mission  bed  down requirements. 6.2.25.  Theater Business Clearance (TBC) Policy/Process.  The Annex W must discuss the TBC  process  to  ensure  CCDRs  have  visibility  and  some  level  of  control  over  systems  and 38 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 external support contracts with performance in the CCDR’s AOR.  The TBC policy/process typically consists of three key tasks: 6.2.25.1.  Translate theater/JOA policies into contract provisions/clauses; 6.2.25.2.  Central posting and maintenance of those clauses and 6.2.25.3.  Validation that solicitations/contracts with performance  in the designated JOA include the required theater or JOA provisions/clauses prior to TBC approval. 6.2.25.4.  TBC approval is required for contractors to be issued a Letter of Authorization (LOA) in SPOT. 6.2.25.5.  Theater/JOA  clauses  are  approved  by  DPAP  and  maintained  on  the  CCDR’s centralized TBC website. 6.2.25.6.  Requests  for  TBC  are  submitted  and  approved  via  the  Joint  Contingency Contracting System (JCCS) Module. 6.2.25.7.  The  AF  component’s  supporting  appendix  to  Annex  W  should  identify organization(s) responsible and processes for each of these TBC tasks. 6.2.26.  Contract  Administration  Delegation  (CAD)  Policy/Process.    Annex  W  should identify  whether  or  not  the  CCDR  is  establishing  a  CAD  policy/process.    AF  component plans  must  discuss  process  for  implementing  CCDR  CAD  policy.    However,  this  is  a contracting process and the respective AFICA/OL and/or AFFOR/A7K in coordination with SAF/AQC has the lead for developing the CAD process. 6.2.27.  Contractor Deployment, Reception and Redeployment Process.  Service components will  typically  be  tasked  to  establish  Joint  Reception  Centers  (JRCs).    These  JRCs  are responsible  for  validating  that  contractors  have  met  all  theater  entrance  requirements (medical/dental,  passports/visas,  protective  equipment,  LOAs,  etc.)  prior  to  forward movement  to  the  contractors  performance  location/base  in  the  theater.    External  support contractors,  whether  prime  or  sub-contractors,  may  be  coming  from  countries  all  over  the world.    Therefore,  the  JRC  process  is  critical  to  help  ensure  the  safety  of  military  forces, uphold  diplomatic  relations  and  prevent  violations  of  international  laws.    AF  component planners  must  coordinate  with  JRCs  to  ensure  all  CAAF  process  through  these  JRCs.  AFFOR A4 has the lead for establishing contractor deployment, reception and redeployment procedures. 6.2.28.  Contractor  Accountability  Process.    AF  components  are  responsible  for  contractor accountability  whether  it’s  by  using  the  Synchronized  Pre-deployment  and  Operational Tracker  (SPOT)  or  some  other  system.    Contractor  accountability  pertains  primarily  to CAAF since the U.S.  Government is responsible for their security.  Non-CAAF contractors typically do not reside on a military base and when outside the base, the military is typically not  responsible for their  security.  Therefore, accountability for non-CAAF is  generally the responsibility  of  the  employing  contractor.    If  the  use  of  SPOT  is  required,  all  CAAF contractors will be entered into SPOT and a Letter of Authorization (LOA) will be generated prior to deployment.  In turn, the entry into SPOT and the LOA will be verified during the JRC  process.    Contracting  Officers,  CORs  and  contractors  all  have  a  role  in  updating information   Any  CAAF  non-compliance  with  SPOT  requirements  or accountability procedures must be reported to the administering Contracting Officer, who is in  SPOT. AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 39 responsible  for  holding  the  contractor  accountable  for  complying  with  the  terms  and conditions  of  their  contract.    IAW  AFI  13-103,  AFFOR  Staff  Operations,  Readiness  and Structures,  AFFOR/A1  has  the  lead  for  establishing  contractor  accountability  procedures, food  service  support,  facilities,  equipment  and  ration  support.    In  addition,  the  AFFOR/A1 develops, maintains and executes mortuary affairs support in the event a CAAF member dies while in-theater. 6.2.29.  Contractor  Arming  Requirements.    Annex  W  will  discuss  whether  contractor personnel will be authorized to be armed.  It will also include the process for receiving host country  approval  to  arm  contractors  and  process  for  getting  approval  to  import/export weapons.  In the supporting Annex W, AF component planners should establish procedures for ensuring compliance with requirements for arming contractors and compliance with Arms Export  Control  Act  (AECA)  and  the  International  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulations  (ITARS) which  implement  the  AECA.    AFFOR/A7S  has  the  lead  for  establishing  procedures  for complying with contractor arming requirements. 6.2.30.  Discipline and Legal Status of Contractors.  Annex W will address the applicability of US and host nation laws to contractors.  CAAF personnel may be subject to prosecution under federal law, including, but not limited to, the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA).  CAAF supporting Armed Forces overseas during declared war and in contingency operations are to prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  However, the applicability of such laws may vary for local non-CAAF contractors.  AFFOR/JA has the lead  for  addressing  the  implementation  of  contractor  discipline  and  enforcement  of applicable laws to contractors. 6.2.31.  Government-Furnished  Support  for  CAAF.    Support  includes  but  is  not  limited  to billeting,  medical,  dental,  personnel  recovery,  security/protection,  transportation,  mortuary affairs,  subsistence,  MWR,  base  exchange  privileges,  religious  support,  mail  services, protective gear, etc. 6.2.32.  Base  Access  for  Contractors.    AF  component  planners  must  address  planning considerations for vetting contractors and issuing base access.  In conjunction with functional specialist  such  as  OSI,  Security  Forces,  plans  should  consider  the  operating  environment, security, status of contractor, etc. 6.2.33.  Contract  Performance  Oversight  Process.    IAW  FAR  1.602-2,  Contracting  officers are  responsible  for  ensuring  performance  of  all  necessary  actions  for  effective  contracting, ensuring  compliance  with  the  terms  of  the  contract,  and  safeguarding  the  interests  of  the United  States  in  its  contractual  relationships.    To  ensure  performance,  CCOs  normally designate and manage CORs as described in Chapter 2 of this AFI. 6.3.  Plan Review. 6.3.1.  Each operational contracting office monitors current plans and coordinates on all plans tasking  the  contracting  organization  for  support  according  to  AFI  10-401,  Air  Force Operations Planning and Execution.  All plans should address appropriate actions to be taken by  each  tasked  functional  unit  to  ensure  continued  performance  of  essential  contractor services pursuant to DoDI 1100.22, Policy and Procedures for Determining Workforce Mix.   In addition to DoDI 1100.22, Policy and Procedures for Determining Workforce Mix, plans for  military  contingency  operations  should  cover  requirements  found  in  DoDI  3020.41, 40 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 Operational  Contract  Support,  and  Joint  Publication  4-10,  Operational  Contract  Support.  Plans  should  also  exploit  the  capabilities  CCOs  can  deliver  as  part  of  an  ADVON  team.  ADVONs should be manned with an experienced CCO who can locate sources and become familiar with local conditions before arrival of the main body of forces.  Plans should provide for  adequate  security  arrangements  and  disbursing  officer  support  during  advanced deployments. 6.3.2.  COCO or equivalent will review OPLANs to determine if contracting support is being tasked.  When a contracting office is  tasked in  an OPLAN  for specific deployment support responsibilities, the respective FAM will ensure the office includes such taskings in its local plans. 6.3.3.  Contracting  units  must  review  expeditionary  site  surveys  of  anticipated  deployment locations.  If a current expeditionary site survey does not exist, contracting units must inform their  SCO  staff.    The  tasked  SCO  staff  must  coordinate  with  the  supported  SCO  staff associated with the geographical combatant command to acquire or recommend the initiation of a expeditionary site survey.  Expeditionary site surveys and base support planning will be accomplished  and  documented  IAW  AFI  10-404,  Base  Support  Plan  and  Expeditionary (BAS&E) Site Survey. 6.3.3.1.  Contracting Site Surveys.  The following topics should be addressed (this is not an all-inclusive list and items may be added as required to meet unit specific needs.) 6.3.3.1.1.  Update  information  concerning  potential  contracting  sources  in  the deployment  area,  including  information  from  the  U.S.  Embassy,  Consulate,  Air Attaches,  and/or  other  Government  agencies  operating  in  the  same  area.    Typically, these agencies can assist with: 6.3.3.1.1.1.  Providing a local interpreter or recommending a vetted source. 6.3.3.1.1.2.  Describing  the  local  security  situation  specifically  details  on  any areas to avoid and/or travel precautions/restrictions. 6.3.3.1.1.3.  Recommending  a  list  of  contractors  to  avoid  for  reasons  like:    poor past  performance,  ties  to  organized  crime,  or  affiliation  with  groups  counter  to American interest. 6.3.3.1.1.4.  Include  a  master  listing  of  contractors  and  identify  those  willing  to provide emergency response after normal business hours. 6.3.3.1.1.5.  Assess vendor acceptance of the Government-wide Purchase Card. 6.3.3.1.1.6.  Identify  sources  for  potential  and  pre-identified  requirements.    If  no source  is  available  to  provide  a  pre-identified  requirement,  the  survey  should establish procedures for ensuring the user is notified that contracting support may not be available for the requirement at a particular deployment site. 6.3.3.1.1.7.  Survey  local  customs,  laws,  taxes,  and  shortages  within  the  local economy, language  difficulties,  currency exchange  rate  fluctuations,  and  security  concerns.    If  local  sales  tax  exemption procedures or numbers are available, obtain them through embassy personnel. local  bureaucratic impediments, 6.3.3.1.1.8.  Examine local transportation  and  communication resources AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 41 availability. 6.3.3.1.1.9.  Determine  the  applicability  of  the  Host  Nation  Mutual  Support Agreements,  Status  of  Forces  Agreements,  Acquisition  Cross-Servicing Agreements,  or  other  diplomatic  agreements,  if  any,  and  evaluate  the  impact  of these agreements upon contingency contracting within the deployment area. 6.3.3.1.1.10.  Survey  facilities,  equipment,  and  other  support  needed  for  the deployed contracting office.  Coordinate contracting facility requirements with the Civil Engineer, Communications Specialist, and Logistics functional commanders as necessary. 6.3.3.1.1.11.  Consider problems that should be anticipated in supporting contract requirements  for  an  extended  exercise  or  contingency  operation.    Particular attention  should  be  given  to  those  items  or  services  that  are  available  in  limited quantities. 6.3.3.1.1.12.  Determine  what  contract  formats  may  be  needed  in  the  local  area considering  Host  Nation  Support  Agreements,  expected  taskings,  and  local business customs. 6.3.4.  Emergency Vendor Lists.  Based on the requirements of any plans (OPLANs, IEMP, etc.) and any associated contracting site surveys, CCOs should develop a list of vendors who can  respond  in  an  emergency  situation  or  with  capabilities  that  are  required  by  any contingency plans. 42 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 Chapter 7 CONTINGENCY EXECUTION 7.1.  General. 7.1.1.  In  providing  contingency  contracting  support,  CCOs  will  perform  tasks  required  by established  OPLANs,  contingency  support  plans,  and  this  guidance.    Figure  7.1  below  is from the  Defense  Contingency  Contracting  Handbook  which  can  be  found  at: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/ccap/cc/jcchb/index.html. Figure 7.1.  Phases of a Contingency. 7.2.  Deployment Requirements. 7.2.1.  A CCO’s first  priority will be to  respond to  basic life support requirements.  During this  phase,  CCOs  may  find  themselves  being  the  requestor,  approving  official,  certifying officer,  and  transportation  office  for  deliveries.    Detailed  planning  can  preclude  some  of these  additional  duties;  however,  physical  limitations  on  the  number  of  support  personnel deployed in the early stages of a contingency will require a high degree of flexibility on the part of the CCO.  Contracted support will generally be used to provide basic life support and other selected functions.  The actual mix of contracting or other support mechanisms such as Host Nation Support (HNS) will be based on risk, reliability, and availability of these various  AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 43 sources of support.  Maximum use of existing “peacetime” contracting arrangements should be considered.  Contracting at  this time of the operation is  generally  focused on expediting contract award. 7.2.1.1.  Determine  Requirements  Priorities.    Expeditionary  contracting  commanders and/or  senior  ranking  CCOs  at  each  location  will  work  with  the  deployed  commander (e.g.    Air  Expeditionary  Wing/CC,  Expeditionary  Mission  Support  Group/CC,  etc.)  to establish the unit’s requirements/priority of needs, to include: 7.2.1.2.  Security 7.2.1.3.  Food  and  water  for  those  personnel  not  serving  in  field  conditions  and  not receiving a basic allowance for subsistence (BAS) 7.2.1.4.  Shelter (both living and working facilities) 7.2.1.5.  Transportation, specifically identifying rental vehicle requirements 7.2.1.6.  Laundry services 7.2.1.7.  Human waste and garbage disposal 7.2.1.8.  Ground fuels requiring local purchase action 7.2.1.9.  Heavy equipment 7.2.1.10.  Communications,  to  include  priorities  for  use  of  limited  telephone  and  radio facilities. 7.2.1.11.  Utilities.    Some  countries  have  unique  requirements  that  effect  connectivity with  communication  and  other  equipment.    If  not  included  in  a  site  survey  or  other planning documents, CCOs should research the specific utility capabilities/limitations of the location(s) of the contingency operation. 7.2.1.12.  Computer/ADP support (to include equipment maintenance) 7.2.1.13.  Quality-of-life issues (i.e., recreational equipment) 7.2.2.  Establish  Requirements  Validation,  Processing and  Funding  Procedures.  Expeditionary  contracting  commanders  and/or  senior  ranking  CCOs  at  each  location  will work  with  the  deployed  commander  (e.g.    Air  Expeditionary  Wing/CC,  Expeditionary Mission Support Group/CC, etc.) to: 7.2.2.1.  Review  and  establish  purchase  request  control  procedures include requirements determination, requirements approval/validation, and requirements approval process flow. to 7.2.2.2.  Identify  individuals  (by  name  or  position)  who  are  authorized  to  approve/ validate purchase request and the name of the individual (or office) providing the funding source. 7.2.2.3.  Identify  individuals  (by  name  or  position)  who  are  authorized  to  certify  funds availability. 7.2.2.4.  Ensure  the  Accounting  and  Finance  function  provides  sufficient  disbursing agents with sufficient funding to allow timely contract support for the CCO and ordering officers 44 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 7.2.2.5.  Advise  all  personnel  that  only  the  CCO  is  authorized  to  obligate  the  U.S. Government for local purchases and direct that no one place undue pressure or command influence on CCOs to purchase any goods and services that violate laws and regulations 7.2.3.  Establish  Contracting  Office.    Expeditionary  contracting  commanders  and/or  senior ranking  CCOs  at  each  location  will  work  with  the  deployed  commander  (e.g.    Air Expeditionary  Wing/CC,  Expeditionary  Mission  Support  Group/CC, to provide/establish: etc.) 7.2.3.1.  Suitable  office  space  for  the  contracting  function  to  include,  at  a  minimum, desks,  secure  filing  cabinet,  telephones  (Class  A  telephone  with  long  distance  Defense Switched Network (DSN) and off base access), fax lines, internet connections and email service (NIPR/SIPR preferred). 7.2.3.2.  Low  security  profile  transportation/dedicated  vehicles  to  meet  CCO  mission requirements. 7.2.3.3.  Mobile/cell phone if possible. 7.2.3.4.  Interpreter, if necessary. 7.2.4.  Review Host Nation Support Agreements. 7.2.4.1.  For  contingency  and  exercise  operations  in  a  foreign  country,  a  Host  Nation Support Agreement (i.e., National Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Mutual Support Agreement), Status of Forces Agreement, Assistance in Kind Agreements, or Acquisition Cross-Servicing  Agreements  may  exist.    These  agreements  normally  are  negotiated through  the  U.S.    State  Department  to  provide  host  nation  support  for  deployed  U.S. forces  during  a  contingency  operation.    CCOs  should  contact  the  local  US  Embassy  or Consulate  for  copies  of  these  agreements.    Support  items  under  these  agreements  may include billeting, food, water and ice, ground fuel, transportation, utilities (i.e., electricity or communications) 7.2.4.2.  Deployed CCOs do not have the authority to enter into agreements with foreign governments.    If  an  agreement  is  already  in  existence,  the  CCO  may  obtain  authority through the Air Force Component A4/7K or AFICA (OL-supported MAJCOM) SCO to the  Combatant  Command’s  Host  Nation  Support  Office  to  write  priced  delivery  orders against  them.    However,  if  an  agreement  is  needed,  the  CCO  may  request  the establishment of an agreement. 7.2.4.3.  Legal  personnel  advise  CCOs  regarding  international  agreements  (see  section 1.9 of this AFI) 7.2.4.4.  ACSA  Global  Automated  Tracking  and  Reporting  System  (AGATRS).    (see section 4.5.1 of this AFI) 7.2.5.  Identify Commercial Sources. 7.2.5.1.  Contact the SCO staff, existing military installations within the deployment area, or,  in  the  absence  of  these,  the  U.S.  Embassy  or  Consulate  in  the  host  nation  for  any information on commercial sources. 7.2.5.2.  Obtain  maps  of  adjacent  towns  or  settlements  and  conduct  personal  visits  to learn availability of necessary items  of supplies or services.  Secure telephone books of AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 45 the local area, if available.  Source lists should be created and annotated to reflect which contractors will provide 24 hour emergency response. 7.2.5.3.  Work  with  the  deployed  commander  to  establish  good  working  relations  with local officials 7.2.6.  Establish/Administer Centralized/Decentralized Procurement Instruments. 7.2.6.1.  Establish  and  manage  centralized  ordering  instruments  such  as  requirements contracts  or  blanket  purchase  agreements  (BPAs).    As  required,  appoint  decentralized ordering  officers  within  functional  areas  for  any  requirements  contracts  or  BPAs.  Ordering officers will be trained in the use of SAP and funds accountability. 7.2.6.2.  Identify  functional  personnel  who  deployed  with  a  Government-wide  Purchase Card  (GPC)  and  home  station  funding.    Coordinate  and  control  purchase  card  activity according to purchase request approval procedures to achieve economical purchases and avoid duplication of purchased resources.  Advise deployed cardholders on local market conditions, limitations and statement reconciliation procedures. 7.2.6.3.  Maintain  files/registers  for  contracts,  BPAs,  and  purchase  orders  to  record  all contracting  actions.    The  records  will  include:    purchase  request  number,  procurement instrument  identification  number  (PIIN),  date  of  purchase  or  award,  name  of  vendor  or contractor, dollar amount  (U.S. Dollars); and a brief description of supplies or services.  Dispose  of  documents  according  to  AFI  33-364,  Records  Disposition  -  Procedures  and Responsibilities, and Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). 7.2.6.4.  Report  total  contracting  actions  and  dollars  at  least  monthly,  unless  otherwise directed by the supported SCO. 7.2.7.  Establish Customer Education Program. 7.2.7.1.  Develop customer training in coordination with finance to educate customers on process  to  include  requirements  prioritization,  validation/approval,  funding,  contracting, quality assurance, inspection/acceptance and payment as soon as practicable; and 7.2.7.2.  Advise  customers  to  review  DPAP’s  most  current  Defense  Contingency  COR Handbook  (http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/ccap/cc/corhb/)  which  provides  essential information, tools, and training for CORs and requiring activities. 7.2.8.  Establish Quality Assurance/Inspection/Acceptance Process. 7.2.8.1.  Ensure requiring activities provide adequately skilled CORs to document receipt and acceptance of goods and services and maintain quality assurance and accountability of purchased assets. 7.2.9.  Document Continuity/Lessons Learned. 7.2.9.1.  Maintain  a  Deployed  CCO’s  Continuity  book  to  provide  continuity  for  any follow-on  CCO.    Upon  termination  of  a  deployment,  the  last  CCO  will  forward  the continuity  book  to  the  AOR’s  Component  Headquarters  A4/7K  (Contracting  Division) Staff  or  AFICA  (OL-supported  MAJCOM)  SCO’s  staff.    The  book  will  include  as  a minimum: 46 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 7.2.9.2.  Current vendor and contractor source listing to include vendor names, addresses, telephone numbers, points of contact, and type of supplies and services provided 7.2.9.3.  Current  list  of  vendors  and  contractors  willing  to  provide  24  hour  per  day emergency support 7.2.9.4.  Copies  of  all  headquarters  policy  letters  or  messages  of  guidance  received  to date 7.2.9.5.  Minutes  from  significant  meetings  (as  determined  by  the  lead  CCO  or  higher authority)  attended  by  CCO  personnel  to  include  open  action  items  impacting  the contracting function 7.2.9.6.  Listing of all ratification actions to date 7.2.9.7.  Copies of all customer education handouts developed to date 7.2.9.8.  Key points of contact at the deployed site to include name, grade, duty title, unit, telephone number, and after hours point of contact, if available 7.2.9.9.  Lessons learned during the deployment to date 7.2.9.10.  Copies of weekly reports of actions and dollars spent to date and 7.2.9.11.  Any other pertinent information 7.3.  Build-up/Employment of Forces. 7.3.1.  Also known as reception, staging, onward movement, and integration (RSOI).  During this  phase,  contracting  personnel  (military  and  civilian)  and  contractor  personnel  will continue to arrive, though not necessarily at a rate commensurate with the number of troops to be supported.  In major operations, a mix of theater support and external support contracts, including  AFCAP,  and  DLA  prime  vendor  contracts  may  be  extensively  utilized.    At  this time, the comptroller may implement a formal acquisition review board process including a more  developed  purchase  request  system.    Theater  support  contracting  efforts  will  still  be heavily involved with the acquisition of basic troop support requirements that are not covered by CAP task orders or other means of support.  Contracting should move from the SF44 to more  long-term  contracting  arrangements  such  as  SF1449,  Solicitation/Contract/Order  for Commercial Items, or BPAs. 7.3.1.1.  Contingency contracting activities during the build-up/RSOI phase.  During the build-up phase of a contingency contracting deployment, CCOs will generally be heavily involved  in  supporting  the  bed  down  of  arriving  forces.    In  this  phase,  additional contracting  personnel  may  arrive  with  the  assigned  unit  to  augment  initial  contracting teams.  Contracting members from home bases should replace those members located at the site to support initial bed down activities.  Establish as early as possible a responsive purchasing system.  A responsive purchasing system shall include; 7.3.1.1.1.  Requirements requisitioning controls.  Implement procedures acceptable to the  assigned  commander  (e.g.,  AEW/CC,  EMSG/CC).    These  procedures  need  to address: AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 47 7.3.1.1.2.  Formats for requisitions such as DD Form 1348-6, DoD Single Line Item Requisition  System  Document  and  other  forms  such  as  an  AF  Form  9,  Purchase Request. 7.3.1.1.3.  Approval authority; and 7.3.1.1.4.  Finance and supply coordination 7.3.1.2.  Funding and Disbursing.  Implement procedures with the finance staff to ensure funds are available to pay for purchases.  Where AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization, is  used  for  short-term  contingencies,  instructions  shall  be  followed  to  properly  record transactions.    Instructions  should  identify  any  restrictions  on  equipment  or  services  that are not properly chargeable to the appropriations cited on the AF Form 616. 7.3.1.2.1.  CCOs  should  not  be  assigned  as  paying  agents  of  the  Accounting  and Finance Office (AFO).  This improves internal controls over the distribution of funds to the contractor, avoids a potential conflict of interest for the CCO and reduces the CCO’s exposure to personal legal liability. 7.3.1.2.2.  Security  forces  shall  be  notified  when  a  significant  amount  of  cash ($10,000) is to be moved (per DoD FMR 7000-14R, Vol. 5, Chap 3). 7.3.1.3.  Purchasing  methods.   SF44  (Purchase  Order—Invoice  Voucher),  cash, Government-wide purchase cards, and SAP are the primary tools for purchasing over-the-counter  supplies  and  services  during  the  initial  days  of  the  build-up.    BPAs  should  be issued to several suppliers offering items of the same type as soon as possible to expedite ordering. 7.3.1.3.1.  Individuals in functional areas should be appointed, trained, and authorized to place calls against pre-priced BPAs. 7.3.1.3.2.  Where cash is used, the SF 44 shall be completed as a receipt to document the transaction and shall be clearly marked to show that payment was made in cash to preclude duplicate payment to the supplier. 7.3.1.3.3.  Government-wide  Purchase  Card  procedures  may  be  implemented  to permit decentralized purchasing of small dollar items during extended contingencies. 7.3.1.4.  Non-appropriated fund (NAF) contracting.  Implement procedures acceptable to the assigned Commander and Chief of Services that address: 7.3.1.4.1.  Formats for NAF contracting, such as AF Form 9 and AF Form 2209, Non-appropriated Fund Order for Supplies or Services.  (AF Form 2209 is available at the AFNAFPO website); 7.3.1.4.2.  Approval/Signature authority for NAF Contracting; 7.3.1.4.3.  Use of cash to make local purchases of supplies and resale merchandise; 7.3.1.4.4.  Use of BPAs and concession contracts. 7.4.  Sustainment. 7.4.1.  CCOs  may  be  expected  to  take  on  the  role  of  business  advisor.    In  this  role,  CCOs should be engaged with customers to develop a deliberate plan of action to move away from 48 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 cost-plus  award-fee  CAP  task  orders  and  emergency  procurement  towards  long-term contracts.    Requirements  will  become  more  defined  and  consolidated  and  the  use  of performance based contracting methods will be maximized when possible.  The transition of CAP  task  orders  to  long-term  theater  support  contacts  is  dependent  on  specific  mission factors such as threat-level and the availability of reliable, local commercial vendor base. 7.4.1.1.  Contingency contracting activities during the sustainment phase.  Requirements may  begin  to  include  more  quality  of  life  items,  longer  or  more  complex  services  and more specialized commodities.  Contingency contracting operations will focus on giving sound  business  advice,  proper  file  documentation,  cost  reduction  efforts,  contract closeout and other best practices. 7.4.1.2.  Requirements will be consolidated whenever possible to achieve the economies of scale. 7.4.1.3.  CCOs and requiring activities should consider longer-term contracts. 7.4.1.4.  CCOs will engage with customers to develop performance-based requirements. 7.4.1.5.  Agreements  may  be  established  with  other  Services  to  share  contract arrangements such as transportation, laundry, etc. 7.4.1.6.  Procedures will be established to acquire items that are not available in the AOR.  Alternatives sources to consider are: 7.4.1.6.1.  Reach back support; 7.4.1.6.2.  Contracting offices in the vicinity of the deployment, but outside the AOR; 7.4.1.6.3.  Military depots; 7.4.1.6.4.  Army  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES)  or  Navy  Exchange  (NEX) and 7.4.2.  CCOs  shall  document  all  contracting  actions  in  sufficient  detail  to  provide  an  audit trail of the acquisition using a cradle to grave approach. 7.4.3.  CCOs  will  upload  contracts  to  Electronic  Document  Access  (EDA)  and  complete contract action reporting through Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) when available. 7.5.  Termination/Redeployment. 7.5.1.  Contingency  contracting  activities  must  be for transition/drawdown.  With adequate notice, CCOs can modify, terminate or extend contracts to meet the transition/drawdown schedule for the contingency operation. the  planning involved in 7.5.1.1.  Contingency  contracting  activities  during  the  termination/redeployment  phase.  CCOs will terminate and close out existing contracts/orders as needed.  Ratifications and claims  must  be  processed  and  completed  IAW  FAR  and  applicable  supplements.    If  a contracting  activity  is  required  to  leave  contracts  open  at  the  end  of  an  operation,  they will  be  transferred  to  an  appropriate  organization  for  continued  administration  and eventual close out. AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 49 7.5.1.2.  CCOs  will  coordinate  with  contractors  and  requiring  activities  for  return  of  all rental items; 7.5.1.3.  CCOs  will  coordinate  with  requiring  activities  to  determine  which  contracts require termination actions.  During termination of base services, CCOs will immediately negotiate a reduction of services and terminate base support agreements to coincide with the  unit  redeployment  schedule.    As  unit  assets  are  redeployed,  interim  replacement support may be required from the host nation and local contractor. 7.5.1.4.  CCOs  will  coordinate  with  requiring  activities  and  contractors,  to  ensure  that receiving  reports  and  invoices  for  all  purchases  are  completed  and  appropriately distributed 7.5.1.5.  CCOs  will  coordinate  with  the  DFAS  and  other  disbursing  activities/agents  to ensure that payments are finalized and processed; 7.5.1.6.  CCOs will settle all contractor claims prior to the final redeployment; and 7.5.1.7.  CCOs  will  coordinate  the  disposition  of  all  purchased  assets  to  include  site restoration if necessary. 7.5.2.  Contracting  action  reporting  and  disposition:      Report  all  contract  actions  and  dollar amounts  to  the  contracting  activity  that  issued  the  PIINs  used  during  the  deployment;  total actions  and  dollars  will  be  reported  by  office  chiefs  to  the  supported  CINC/  SCO  prior  to departure. 7.5.3.  After-action  report.    As  directed  by  Component  Headquarters  A4/7K  or  associated AFICA  (OL-supported  MAJCOM)  SCO  staff,  CCOs  must  complete  and  submit  an  After-Action website: https://jccs.bta.mil/AAR/Default.aspx.  Within the comment sections of the AAR, the CCO should cover the following areas: (AAR) Report using the DPAP CCO AAR 7.5.3.1.  A  formal  update  of  site  survey  information  concerning  potential  sources  of supply  to  include  items  obtained  through  the  U.S.    Embassy,  host  nation  support,  or servicing U.S. military installations; 7.5.3.2.  Problems  encountered  with  the  contracting  process  to  include  local  customs, shortages of supply within the local economy, local political or diplomatic impediments, language difficulties, funding, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and security issues or concerns; 7.5.3.3.  Local transportation, billeting, and communication resource availability; 7.5.3.4.  Evaluation of any Host Nation Support Agreement or comparable understanding, Status  of  Forces  Agreements,  if  applicable,  and  the  impact  of  these  agreements  upon contingency contracting within the area (applies to overseas contingency); 7.5.3.5.  Adequacy  of  facilities,  equipment,  and  other  support  provided  by  the  deployed commander  and  the  OPLAN  under  which  the  deployment  was  conducted.    Specific modifications required for future deployment plans to this or other locations; 7.5.3.6.  Any specific problems that could be anticipated to support an extended exercise or contingency operation at this location; and 50 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 7.5.3.7.  Special  personnel  requirements  (rank,  gender,  skill  level,  etc.),  contingency  kit requirements,  or  individual  clothing  and  equipment  requirements  to  meet  mission demands in this area. AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 51 Chapter 8 SUPPORT TO JOINT OPERATIONS 8.1.  General. 8.1.1.  DoDI  3020.41,  Operational  Contract  Support  (OCS),  requires  GCCs  to  implement OCS  actions  (e.g.,  planning,  accountability,  visibility,  deployment,  protection  and redeployment requirements) to: 8.1.2.  Incorporate  appropriate  contingency  program  management  processes  during applicable contingency operations. 8.1.3.  Comply with applicable U.S., international, and local laws, regulations, policies, and agreements. 8.1.4.  Use contract support only in appropriate situations consistent with  subpart 7.5 of the Federal  Acquisition Regulation  (FAR), subpart 207.503 of the Defense  Federal  Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and DoDI 1100.22. 8.1.5.  Fully  consider,  plan  for,  integrate,  and  execute  acquisition  of,  contracted  support, including synchronizing and integrating contracted support flowing into an operational area from  systems  support,  external  support  and  theater  support  contracts,  and  managing  the associated  contractor  personnel,  into  applicable  contingency  operations  consistent  with CCDR  policies  and  procedures  and  Joint  Publication  (JP)  4-10,  Operational  Contract Support. 8.2.  Joint Operational Contract Support (OCS) Process. 8.2.1.  Effective and efficient OCS execution requires a programmatic approach by the JFC. 8.2.2.  This  JFC-centric  approach  requires  commanders  and  staffs  to  fully  consider  cost, performance,  schedule,  and  contract  oversight  requirements  as  well  as  many  other  contract support-related  matters  (e.g.,  risk  of  contractor  failure  to  perform,  civil-military  impact, operations security) across the joint force, to include USG departments and agencies and key multinational partners. 8.2.3.  Specifically,  the  combatant  command  (CCMD),  in  coordination  with  (ICW) subordinate joint force commands, Service components, supporting CSAs, and multinational partners,  should  develop  a  planned,  tailored,  and  sufficiently  resourced  organizational construct for OCS. 8.2.4.  The three overall supporting functions and associated tasks contained in the following figure from JP 4-10, Operational Contract Support help to characterize OCS. 52 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 Figure 8.1.  Three Pillars of OCS. 8.2.5.  OCS  includes  the  ability  to  plan,  orchestrate,  and  synchronize  the  provision  of contract  support  integration,  contracting  support,  and  contractor  management.  These  three functions  are  inextricably  linked  to  achieving  favorable  operational  and  acquisition outcomes.  AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 53 Figure 8.2.  AFFOR OCS Process and Structure. 8.3.  OCS Planning (Annex W). 8.3.1.  Planning for OCS involves much more than just planning for contingency contracting support. 8.3.1.1.  Refer  to  JP-4-10,  Operational  Contract  Support  and  Chapter  6  of  this  AFI  for more information on the contents of Annex W. 8.4.  Contract Support Integration.  8.4.1.1.  OCS  planning  and  integration  is  a  multidisciplinary  team  effort  which  require involvement of many commands, staffs, and supporting contracting activities along with numerous  GCC  and/or  subordinate  JFC  directed  boards,  cells,  and  working  groups.  No single “OCS”-related organization is in direct control of all OCS actions in support of a joint  operation;  rather,  multiple  joint,  Service,  and  CSA  commands  and  supporting acquisition  and  contracting  organizations  coordinate  OCS  actions  through  designated boards, centers, cells, and working groups. 8.4.1.2.  Planning  and  Coordination  Boards,  Cells,  and  Working  Groups.    Includes combatant  commander  logistics  procurement  support  board  (CLPSB),  OCS  Integration Cell (OCSIC) and the OCS working groups. 8.4.1.3.  CLPSB is established by the GCC to coordinate OCS and related logistics efforts across  the  entire  AOR.    This  board  is  normally  chaired  by  a  CCMD  J-4  and  includes representatives from  each Component Headquarters, CSA, as well as other military  and USG  departments  and  agencies  or  organizations  concerned  with  general  logistics  to include OCS-related matters. 54 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 8.4.1.4.  OSCIC plan, coordinate and integrate OCS actions across all joint, personal, and special staffs, Service components, CSAs, and lead theater support contracting activity in the operational area.  There is no set structure or size for an OCSIC at either level; size and  configuration  is  mission  dependent.    This  cell  should  be  made  up  of  a  mixture  of specially  trained  personnel  with  operational-level  logistics  and  contingency  contracting experience. 8.4.1.5.  OCS working groups are as-needed, temporary coordination mechanism utilized by  the  GCC  to  plan  and  coordinate  OCS  matters  across  the  staff  and  with  key  mission partners. OCS working groups are normally chaired by a designated OCSIC member and meet as necessary to work specific OCS-related planning or execution-related issues. 8.4.1.6.  Appendix F of JP 4-10, Operational  Contract  Support  provides more details on OCS-related boards. 8.4.2.  Requirements  Generation  Boards.    Includes  the  joint  requirements  review  board (JRRB). 8.4.2.1.  JRRB  is  the  formal  mechanism  to  review,  validate,  prioritize,  and  approve selected  Service  component  contract  support  requests.    It  should  be  established  at  the subordinate JFC’s level during any sustained operation that includes significant levels of contracted support. It may also be used as a venue to assess possible operational impacts of specific contract support requests and, when appropriate, is used to provide guidance on  recommended  contract  support  request  consolidation  actions  as  well  as  acquisition strategy to the JCSB. 8.4.3.  Contracting Coordination Boards. 8.4.3.1.  The  JCSB  is  the  primary  mechanism  to  coordinate  and  de-conflict  common contracting actions between theater support contracting and external support contracting activities executing or delivering contracted support within the operational area. It is also the  major  mechanism  to  implement  JRRB  guidance  when  it  comes  to  determining  the appropriate contracting mechanism (theater support, CAP task orders, and other common external contract) for major, common services. 8.5.  Contracting Support. 8.5.1.  The  designated  SCO,  which  must  be  an  O-6/GS-15  or  higher,  and  their  supporting staffs  will  exercise  appropriate  oversight  of  contracting  operations  within  their  assigned geographical/functional areas of responsibility. 8.5.2.  The  AF  HCA  delegates  contracting  authority  through  the  AFICA/CC  to  the AFICA/K_  (OL-supported  MAJCOM  Director  of  Contracting)  who  is  responsible  for providing  oversight  of  AF  component  contracting  operations.    The  AFICA/K_  (OL-supported  MAJCOM  Director  of  Contracting)  may  delegate  certain  contracting  staff oversight  responsibilities  to  the  C-NAF  A4/7K,  but  the  responsibility  for  ensuring compliance with procurement laws remains with the SCO. 8.5.3.  C-NAF A4/7K serves as the component contracting planner, business advisor, and the liaison between the component ECONS and the designated AFICA OL SCO.  For example, AFICA/KC  OL  SCO  serves  as  the  AFCENT  SCO  and  has  oversight  responsibility  for AFCENT contracting operations.  The AFICA/KC OL SCO may delegate responsibility for AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 55 conducting  staff  assistance  visits  to  the  AFCENT/A7K.    However,  the  OL  SCO  has responsibility  for  correcting  issues  where  the  ECONS  may  not  be  complying  with procurement  laws.    In  addition,  the  AFICA/KC  OL  SCO,  and  not  the  AFCENT/A7K,  is typically the clearance authority for AFCENT solicitations/contracts. 8.5.4.  Contracting  coordination requires  visibility  of  all  Service/agency  contract requirements with performance in the designated AOR/JOA.  OCSIC may be better suited to perform these tasks than a Service component.  AF component planners must coordinate with the designated AFICA OL SCO for any plans that require the AF component to serve as the LSCC. 8.5.5.  Even  though  the  GCC/JTF  is  ultimately  responsible  for  implementation  of  theater policy,  the  OCS  Integration  Cell  (OCSIC),  the  Lead  Service  for  Contracting  Coordination (LSCC)  or  Joint  Theater  Support  Contracting  Command  (JTSCC)  will  typically  be designated  responsibility  for  developing  provisions  and  clauses  for  use  in  theater  and submitting them to DPAP for approval. 8.5.5.1.  These standardized clauses should address the minimum acceptable professional standards  under  which location,  documentation requirements,  and  procedures  for  reception  centers;  Government-Furnished  Services authorized;  contractor  accountability  requirements  in  SPOT  or  replacement  system; security  requirements  of  contractor  personnel  and  facilities;  and  redeployment requirements. the  contractor is to  perform; 8.5.6.  GCC is responsible to develop and implement TBC which will likely be conducted by the OCSIC, LSCC, or JTSCC. 8.5.7.  If  the  AF  Component  is  designated  as  the  LSCC,  the  AF  Component  must  have  a dedicated  O-6  SCO  and  supporting  staff  to  be  assigned  responsibilities  for  developing theater-specific  clauses  and  executing  TBC  process.    Otherwise,  these  responsibilities  must be performed by the OCSIC or another Service should be designated the LSCC. 8.6.  Contractor Management. 8.6.1.  The  CCDR  or  subordinate  JFC  shall  provide  specific  deployment  and  theater admission requirements to the DoD Components for each applicable contingency operation.  These requirements must be delineated in supporting contracts as explained in subpart 225.74 of  DFARS  Procedures,  Guidance,  and  Information  (Reference  (y)).    At  a  minimum, contracting  officers  shall  ensure  that  contracts  address  operational  area-specific  contract requirements  and  the  means  by  which  the  Government  will  inform  contractors  of  the requirements and procedures applicable to a deployment. 8.6.1.1.  Pre-deployment  Processing.    Affected  contracts  shall  require  that  all  CAAF process through a designated deployment center or a Government-authorized, contractor-performed deployment processing facility prior to deploying to an applicable contingency operation.    Upon  receiving  the  contracted  company’s  certification  that  employees  meet deployment  requirements,  the  contracting  officer  or  his/her  representative  will  digitally sign  the  LOA.    The  LOA  will  be  presented  to  officials  at  the  deployment  center.    The deployment process shall be for, but not limited to: 8.6.1.2.  Verifying accountability information in SPOT or its successor. 56 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 8.6.1.3.  Issuing applicable Government-furnished equipment. 8.6.1.4.  Verifying  medical  and  dental  screening,  including  required  military-specific vaccinations and immunizations (e.g., anthrax, smallpox). 8.6.1.5.  Verifying  and,  when  necessary,  providing  required  training  (e.g.,  Geneva Conventions;  law  of  armed  conflict;  general  orders;  standards  of  conduct;  force protection;  personnel security;  anti-terrorism; counterintelligence  reporting;  the  use  of  chemical,  biological,  radiological,  nuclear (CBRN)  protective  ensemble),  country  and  cultural  awareness  briefings,  and  other training and briefings as appropriate. first  aid;  operations recovery; 8.6.1.6.  Affected  contingency  contracts  shall  require  that,  prior  to  deployment, contractors  certify  to  the  Government  authorizing  representative  named  in  the  contract that all required deployment processing actions have been completed for each individual. 8.6.2.  Joint  Reception  Centers  (JRCs).    All  CAAF  shall  be  processed  into  the  operational area  through  a  designated  reception  site.    Contractor  personnel  already  in  the  designated operational  area  when  a  contingency  is  declared  must  report  to  the  appropriate  designated reception site as soon as it is operational.  If an Air Force component is directed by the Joint Force  Commander  to  establish  a  JRC,  the  AF  lead  for  the  JRC  will  typically  be  the  AF Component A1. 8.6.2.1.  CAAF Processing:   The JRC shall verify that CAAF have met all requirements to enter the operational area to include the following: 8.6.2.1.1.  Review the CAAF member’s Letter of Authorization (LOA) to confirm the member has been updated in the SPOT database or its successor and is authorized to enter  the  operational  area;    (NOTE:      The  LOA  will  identify  which  Government-Furnished Services (GFS) the CAAF member is authorized.) 8.6.2.1.2.  Verify  that  CAAF  member  has  met  all  theater  and  country-specific  entry requirements to include passports, visas, CAC, etc.; 8.6.2.1.3.  Confirm that CAAF member possesses any required IPE, including CBRN protective ensemble; 8.6.2.1.4.  If authorized Government transportation from the JRC to their performance location  in  the  operational  area,  the  JRC  will  provide  additional  instructions  to  the CAAF member for forward movement; 8.6.2.1.5.  Confirm  that  CAAF  member  has  met  all  medical/dental/immunization requirements for entry into the operational area. 8.6.2.2.  Denial of Entry into Operational Area.  If any CAAF member does not have the proper documentation, the JRC may refuse entry into the theater, and the JRC will notify the responsible contracting officer, who will notify the contractor to take action to resolve the  reason  for  the  lack  of  proper  documentation  for  performing  in  that  area.    If  the contractor fails to take appropriate action, the CAAF member will be sent back to his or her  departure  point,  or  directed  to  the  Component  Headquarters  or  Defense  Agency responsible for that specific contract for theater entrance processing. AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 57 8.6.3.  Theater  and  Country  Clearance  Requirements.    Special  area,  country,  and  theater personnel  clearance  documents  must  be  current  in  accordance  with  the  DoD  Foreign Clearance Guide to ensure that entry requirements do not impact accomplishment of mission requirements.  CAAF employed in support of a DoD mission are considered DoD-sponsored personnel for foreign clearance purposes.  Contracting officers shall ensure contracts include a  requirement  that  CAAF  must  meet  theater  personnel  clearance  requirements  and  must obtain  personnel  clearances  prior  to  entering  applicable  contingency  operations.    Contracts shall  require  CAAF  to  obtain  proper  identification  credentials  (e.g.,  passport,  visa)  as required by the terms and conditions of the contract. 8.6.4.  Contractor Oversight and Support. 8.6.4.1.  Government-Furnished Services.  Generally, contingency contracts shall require that  contractors  provide  all  life,  mission,  and  administrative  support  to  their  employees necessary  to  perform  IAW  CCDR  guidance  as  posted  on  the  CCDR  OCS  website.  Requiring  activities  should  estimate  the  Government-furnished  services  to  be  provided for  CAAF  and  selected  non-CAAF.    The  requiring  activity  will  confirm  with  theater adjudication authorities that the Government has the capacity, capability, and willingness to  provide the support.    Prior to  awarding the contract,  the CCO will verify that  proper arrangements for Government support at the deployment center and within the designated operational  area  have  been  made.    The  contract  shall  specify  the  level  of  Government-furnished support to be provided to CAAF and selected non-CAAF and what support is reimbursable to the Government. 8.6.4.2.  Letter of Authorization (LOA).  A SPOT-generated LOA shall be issued by the contracting  officer  or  designee  to  all  CAAF  as  required  by  DFARS  252.225-7040  and selected non-CAAF (e.g., LN private security contractors) as required.  DoD Components shall  coordinate  with  the  SPOT  program  manager  to  obtain  an  LOA  handled  within appropriate security guidelines. 8.6.4.3.  Letter  of  Instruction  (LOI).    IAW  AFI  13-103,  AFFOR  Staff  Operations, Readiness  and  Structures  the  Personnel  Directorate  (A-1)  is  the  principal  advisor  to  the commander  for to Accompany  the  Force  (CAAF)  as  defined  in  JP  4-10,  Operational  Contract  Support (OCS). CCOs will issue an LOI for deploying contractors. including  Contractors  Authorized total  force  accountability, 8.6.4.4.  Legal  Services.    CAAF  are  not  entitled  to  military  legal  assistance  either  in-theater or at the deployment center. 8.6.4.5.  Medical  Services.    Theater-specific  contract  language  to  clarify  available healthcare  can  be  found  on  the  CCDR  websites.    Generally,  DoD  only  provides resuscitative  care,  stabilization,  hospitalization  at  Level  III  medical  treatment  facilities (MTFs), and assistance with patient movement in emergencies where loss of life, limb, or eyesight could occur. 8.6.4.5.1.  Emergency  Medical  and  Dental  Care.    All  CAAF  will  normally  be afforded emergency medical and dental care if injured while supporting contingency operations.  Additionally, non-CAAF employees who are injured while in the vicinity of  U.S.  forces  will  also  normally  receive  emergency  medical  and  dental  care.  58 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 Emergency  medical  and  dental  care  includes  medical  care  situations  in  which  life, limb, or eyesight is jeopardized. 8.6.4.5.2.  Primary  Care.    Primary  medical  or  dental  care  normally  will  not  be authorized or be provided to CAAF by MTFs.  When required and authorized by the CCDR  or  subordinate  JFC,  this  support  must  be  specifically  authorized  under  the terms and conditions of the contract and detailed in the corresponding LOA.  Primary care is not authorized for non-CAAF employees. 8.6.4.5.3.  Long-Term  Care.    DoD  does  not  provide  long-term  care  to  contractor personnel. 8.6.4.5.4.  Quarantine  or  Restriction  of  Movement.    The  CCDR  or  subordinate commander  has  the  authority  to  quarantine  or  restrict  movement  of  contractor personnel. 8.6.4.5.5.  Evacuation.    CAAF  evacuated  for  medical  reasons  from  the  designated operational  area  to  MTFs  funded  by  the  Defense  Health  Program,  are  subject  to normal reimbursement policies. 8.6.4.6.  Security  and  Arming  of  Contractors.    CCDRs  shall  develop  security  plans  for protection of CAAF and selected non-CAAF (e.g., those working on a military facility or as  otherwise  determined  by  the  operational  commander)  in  locations  where  the  civil authority is either insufficient or illegitimate, and the commander determines it is in the interests  of  the  Government  to  provide  security  because  the  contractor  cannot  obtain effective private security services; such services are unavailable at a reasonable cost; or threat conditions necessitate security through military means. 8.6.4.6.1.  In  appropriate  cases,  the  CCDR  may  provide  security  through  military means  commensurate  with  the  level  of  security  provided  DoD  civilians.    Specific security  measures  shall  be  mission  and  situation  dependent  as  determined  by  the CCDR and provided to the contracting officer.  The contracting officer shall include in  the  contract  the  level  of  protection  to  be  provided  to  contingency  contractor personnel  as  determined  by  the  CCDR  or  subordinate  JFC.   Specific  procedures  for determining  requirements  for  and  integrating  contractors  into  the  joint  operational area  (JOA)  force  protection  structure  will  be  placed  on  the  geographic  CCDR websites. 8.6.4.6.2.  Contracts shall require all contingency contractor personnel to comply with applicable  CCDR  and  local  commander  force  protection  policies.    CAAF  may incidentally  receive  protection  that  is  intended  for  U.S.  military  forces  or  facilities.  However, it may be necessary for CAAF to be armed for individual self-defense. 8.6.4.6.2.1.  According  to  applicable  U.S.,  HN,  or  international  law;  relevant SOFAs;  international  agreements;  or  other  arrangements  with  local  authorities and  on  a  case-by-case  basis  when  military  force  protection  and  legitimate  civil authority  are  deemed  unavailable  or  insufficient,  the  CCDR  (or  a  designee  no lower  than  the  general/flag  officer  level)  may  authorize  contingency  contractor personnel to be armed for individual self-defense. 8.6.4.6.2.2.  The  appropriate  SJA  shall  review  all  applications  for  arming  CAAF AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 59 on a case-by-case basis to ensure there is a legal basis for approval. 8.6.4.6.2.3.  When  armed  for  personal  protection,  CAAF  are  only  authorized  to use  force  for  individual  self-defense.    Unless  immune  from  local  laws  or  HN jurisdiction  by  virtue  of  an  international  agreement  or  international  law,  the contract shall include language advising contingency contractor personnel that the inappropriate use of force could subject them to U.S. and local or HN prosecution and civil liability. 8.6.4.7.  Mortuary Affairs. 8.6.4.7.1.  CAAF  who  die  while  in  support  of  U.S.  forces  shall  be  covered  by  the DoD  mortuary  affairs  program.    Every  effort  shall  be  made  to  identify  remains  and account  for  un-recovered  remains  of  contractors  and  their  dependents  that  die  in military  operations,  training  accidents,  and  other  multiple  fatality  incidents.    The remains  of  CAAF  deserve  and  shall  receive  the  same  dignity  and  respect  afforded military remains. 8.6.4.7.2.  DoD  may  provide  mortuary  support  for  the  disposition  of  remains  and personal  effects  at  the  request  of  the  Department  of  State.    The  Under  Secretary  of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&R)) shall coordinate this support with the DoS  to  include cost  reimbursement, where  appropriate.  The disposition  of non-CAAF  contractors  (LNs  and  TCNs)  shall  be  given  the  same  dignity  and  respect afforded  U.S.  personnel.    The  responsibility  for  coordinating  the  transfer  of  these remains  to  the  HN  or  affected  nation  resides  with  the  geographic  CCDR  in coordination and conjunction with the DoS through the embassies or the International Red Cross, as appropriate IAW with applicable contract provisions. 8.6.4.8.  Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) Services.  IAW AFI 34-101, Air Force Morale,  Welfare  and  Recreation  (MWR)  Programs  and  Use  Eligibility,  MWR  will  be authorized for CAAF who are U.S. citizens.  CAAF who are not U.S. citizens and non-CAAF are not authorized MWR and exchange services. 8.6.4.9.  Exchange  Services.    Exchange  services  will  be  authorized  for  CAAF  who  are U.S. citizens.  CAAF who are not U.S. citizens and non-CAAF are not authorized MWR and exchange services. 60 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 Chapter 9 DEFENSE SUPPORT OF CIVIL AUTHORITIES (DSCA) 9.1.  General. 9.1.1.  IAW  JP  3-28,  Defense  Support  of  Civil  Authorities,  DSCA  is  defined  as  support provided  by  federal  military  forces,  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  civilians,  DoD  contract personnel,  DoD  component  assets,  and  National  Guard  (NG)  forces  (when  the  SecDef),  in coordination with the governors of the affected states, elects and requests to use those forces in  Title  32,  United  States  Code,  status  or  when  federalized)  in  response  to  requests  for assistance  from  civil  authorities  for  domestic  emergencies,  law  enforcement  support,  and other domestic activities, or from qualifying entities for special events. 9.1.2.  IAW  AFI  10-801,  Defense  Support  of  Civil  Authorities  (DSCA), DSCA  capabilities are  derived  from  Air  Force  warfighting  capabilities  that  could  be  utilized  to  aid  in  the response  to  disasters,  declared  emergencies,  and  to  support  designated  law  enforcement activities, as well as other authorized activities. DSCA is not support provided in response to foreign disasters (e.g., foreign consequence management or humanitarian assistance/disaster response). 9.1.3.  DSCA  operations  are  divided  into  three  broad  categories:    domestic  emergencies, designated  law  enforcement  support  and  other  activities  which  may  overlap  or  occur simultaneously, depending on the event. 9.1.3.1.  Domestic Emergencies.  The Air Force provides support to a primary agency or the lead federal agency (LFA) as a result of natural, technological or manmade disaster or Presidential declaration of emergency in accordance with National Response Framework (NRF)  guidance.    Civil  authorities  may  request  DoD  assistance  under  the  Stafford  Act, Economy Act, mutual aid memoranda, or under Immediate Response Authority (IRA). 9.1.3.1.1.  Depending  on  the  magnitude  and  location  of  the  emergency,  contingency contracting may play a significant role in supporting this type of DSCA operation. 9.1.3.1.2.  AF will provide contingency contracting support through its home station contracting  units  if  the  associated  base  is  designated  as  a  base  support  installation (BSI)  or  by  deployed  contracting  forces  as  part  of  the  responding  task  force,  which may be a single service task force (SSTF) or a joint task force (JTF). 9.1.3.2.  Designated Law Enforcement Support.  The Posse Comitatus Act (PCA) of 1878 (18 U.S.C.  § 1385) prohibits the direct active participation of military forces to execute civilian  laws  unless  otherwise  authorized  by  law.    This  Act  does  not  apply  to  non-federalized  Air  National  Guard  forces  in  State  Active  Duty  (SAD)  status  or  Title  32 U.S.C.  status.    To  the  extent  authorized,  the  Air  Force  may  provide  indirect  support and/or  assistance  in  restoring  public  health  and  services,  and  civil  order.    Contingency contracting support for this type of DSCA operation will be very limited. 9.1.3.3.  Other  Activities.    The  President  or  Secretary  of  the  Department  of  Homeland Security  (DHS)  may  designate  a  major  event  that  is  considered  to  be  nationally significant  as  a  National  Special  Security  Event  (NSSE).    Air  Force  assets  and AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 61 capabilities  may  be  tasked  to  provide  support  to  a  designated  NSSE.    Contingency contracting support for this type of DSCA operation will be very limited. 9.2.  Incident Response Contracting Support. 9.3.1.  LSCC/SCO Support.  For geographical areas where the AF is designated as the LSCC, the  Air  Force  will  identify  an  O-6  SCO  and  supporting  staff  to  conduct  contracting coordination  with  all  Service/Agency  contracting  activities,  including  BSI  contracting activities.    Depending  on  the  size  and  complexity  of  the  incident,  AFICA  may  deploy  its LSCC  Package  to  assume  contracting  coordination  and  SCO  responsibilities  for  the  DSCA operation. 9.3.2.  JTSCC  Stand-up.    Since  contracting  authority  does  not  flow  through  GCCs,  the  Air Force will also provide its Service contracting authority and standup a JTSCC if directed.  In this  situation,  AFICA  would  deploy  its  JTSCC  Initial  Stand-up  Package  to  stand-up  the JTSCC and establish the associated joint manning document (JMD). 9.3.3.  Contracting  Execution.    While  AFICA  provides  deployment  capabilities  to  perform LSCC  and  JTSCC  stand-up  responsibilities,  contingency  contracting  execution  capabilities come from operational contracting units and are part of much broader Agile Combat Support (ACS) teams.  The primary focus of contingency contracting forces that deploy in support of a  DoD  DSCA  task  force  is  to  provide  contracting  support  in  response  to  FEMA  mission assignments  and  to  provide  base  life  support  for  DoD  responding  forces  at  austere installations. 62 AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 Chapter 10 SUPPORT TO LOCAL EMERGENCIES 10.1.  General. 10.1.1.  IAW  AFPD  10-25,  Air  Force  Emergency  Management  Program,  commanders  and civilian equivalents at all levels will: 10.1.1.1.  Organize,  train  and  equip  personnel  to  conduct  and  sustain  emergency management operations for continuation of air base operations. 10.1.1.2.  Incorporate  EM  concepts,  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures,  into  home-station and expeditionary programs, planning, operations and exercises worldwide. 10.1.1.2.1.  Programs  incorporating  EM  concepts  include  but  are  not  limited  to integrated  defense,  critical  infrastructure,  antiterrorism,  logistics,  transportation  and physical security. 10.2.  Installation Emergency Management Program. 10.2.1.  IAW AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations,  contracting  units  are  tasked  as  OCR  to  provide  additional  capabilities  within each of the following emergency support functions (ESFs): 10.2.1.1.  Transportation (LRS is OPR); 10.2.1.2.  Mass care, emergency assistance, housing and human services (FSS is OPR); 10.2.1.3.  Logistics management and resource support (LRS is OPR); 10.2.1.4.  Search and rescue (CES is OPR); 10.2.1.5.  Oil and hazardous materials response (CES is OPR); 10.2.1.6.  Energy (CES is OPR); 10.2.1.7.  Long term community recovery (CES is OPR). 10.2.1.8.  Detailed  information  for  each  ESF  can  be  found  in  AFMAN  10-2502,  Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) Standards and Procedures. 10.2.2.  In addition, contracting is assigned the following general functional responsibilities: 10.2.2.1.  Provides  contracting  advice  and  alternatives  for  private  sector  support  to  the commander and staff, including deployed elements. 10.2.2.2.  Maintains on-call, 24-hour emergency contracting support for civil emergency and natural disaster relief operations. 10.2.2.3.  Provides  contracting  and  procurement  support  for  locally  procured  supply items. 10.2.2.4.  Ensures  contracts  cover  DoD  requirement  for  HAZMAT  training  when employees will be required to perform HAZMAT response duties. AFI64-105  9 AUGUST 2016 63 10.2.2.5.  Ensures  contracting  officers  are  involved  early  in  the  acquisition  process  to support  and  assist  the  customer  in  ensuring  all  contract  performance  work  statements comply with the requirements of this instruction. 10.3.  Base Support Installation (BSI) and Incident Support Bases (ISB). 10.3.1.  IAW  AFMAN  10-2504,  Air  Force  Incident  Management  Guidance  for  Major Accidents and Natural Disasters, a BSI is a military installation within the US, its territories, or possessions controlled by any Service or agency, in or near an actual or projected domestic emergency operational area. BSIs are designated by the DoD to provide military support for DoD.   ISBs are facilities that support FEMA incident response operations and logistics, and are frequently military installations, designated after request to DoD. 10.3.1.1.  SecDef  designates  the  appropriate  BSI  based  on  previous  site  surveys, assessments, mission analyses and their suitability. 10.3.1.2.  BSIs  will  provide  the  following  resources:    marshalling  and  lay-down  areas, security forces, personnel and equipment reception/staging areas and facilities, personnel support,  billeting,  transportation,  material  handling  equipment,  maintenance,  general supply  and  subsistence  support,  contracting  support,  communications  support,  and medical services. 10.3.1.3.  Installations may be tasked as a BSI for incident relief efforts. The BSI serves as  the  main  logistical  hub  for  military  support  operations.    Contracting  commanders should coordinate with the Readiness and Emergency Management Flight to review and discuss BSI requirements contained in the IEMP 10-2. 10.3.1.3.1.  Major Installation.  If an AF installation is designated as a BSI, the home station  contracting  unit,  typically  base-level  contracting  units  will  provide  BSI contracting  support  and  may  include  existing  installation  support  contracts  or agreements to plan for or bed down responding forces. 10.3.1.3.2.  Austere  Installation.    In  situations  where  there  is  not  a  robust  DoD installation  in  proximity  to  the  incident,  the  responding  AF  contracting  forces  may need  to  establish  contract  support  to  help  mitigate  logistics  capability  shortfalls.    In this situation, the task force may require the deployment of a more robust contingency contracting  capability.    The  deployed  contingency  contracting  forces  may  need  to reach  back  to  Air  Force  Installation  Contracting  Agency  (AFICA)  for  additional contracting support.  AFICA provides enterprise-wide, specialized and expeditionary contracting support from the rear that can be used to support DSCA operations.  DARLENE J.
