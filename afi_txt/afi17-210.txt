USAF PWCS Management Special Considerations. 4.1.  Land Mobile Radio (LMR). 4.1.1.  Procurement of LMR assets and infrastructure has to comply with DoDD 5000.01, The  Defense  Acquisition  System;  DoDI  4650.10,  Land  Mobile  Radio  (LMR) Interoperability  and  Standardization;  AFI  17-111,  Information  Technology  Asset Management,  AFI  63-101,  Integrated  Life  Cycle  Management;  and  established  local procedures. 4.1.2.  38CEIG will review LMR CIPS purchase requests, user radios and infrastructure, to  ensure  they  meet  enterprise  and  efficiencies  concepts.  (T-1).    Requesting  units  and Cyber  Systems  Integrators  will  input  requests  into  CIPS.  (T-3).    Inputs  have  to  capture the need for the LMR upgrade and the requested solution. 4.2.  Family Radio Service (FRS) and Inter Squad Radio (ISR) Systems: 4.2.1.  Air  Force  entities,  within  US&P,  are  authorized  to  purchase  and  operate  radios certified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the FRS.  AF use is on an unlicensed, unprotected basis shared with non-Federal users.  FRS radios cannot be used for  planned  communications  that  safeguard  human  life  or  property.      Use  outside  the US&P  is  subject  to  spectrum  certification  and  frequency  licensing  with  the  host  nation following  geographical  COCOM  spectrum  policy.    Planned  FRS  use  has  to  be coordinated with the installation spectrum manager. 4.2.2.  FRS   devices   are  intended   for  use  by  family,   friends,   and   associates   to communicate  among  themselves  within  a  small  area,  or  while  on  group  outings.    FRS devices may also be used for military-related (administrative) communications, provided they are not used for classified, Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU), command and control, operational,  fire/crash,  security and/or  emergency  response/  medical  communications (see  Table  A2.1).    FRS  devices  are  not  designed  to  make  telephone  calls.    No  FCC controlled  FRS  frequency  channels  can  be  assigned  to  any  specific  individual  or organization.      The  14  commercial  FRS  channels  may  be  used  only  on  a  “take  turns” basis. 4.2.3.  ISR radios are nearly identical to FRS radios. They operate on 14 channels in the ISR spectrum, prior to  equipment  acquisition.  Obtain host nation approval  to  use these 14 frequencies, if ISR radio operation is outside the US&P.  As with its FRS counterpart, they may be used for military-related (administrative) communications, provided they are not  used  for  classified,  SBU,  command  and  control,  operational,  fire/crash,  security and/or emergency response/medical communications (see Table A2.1). 4.2.4.  Citizen’s Band radios cannot be used for government purposes. 4.2.5.  General    Mobile    Radio    Service    (GMRS)    is    a    personal    two-way    voice communications  service  designated  to  individual  and  immediate  family  member  use; GMRS use by DoD government agency is forbidden  14 AFI17-210  26 MAY 2016 4.3.  Interoperability. 4.3.1.  Base  CSO  is  responsible  for  working  with  other  Federal,  DoD,  State  and  local agencies  to  support  interoperability  and  maximize  the  communication  capabilities  of PWCS assets.  Additional guidance can be found in AFPD 10-8, Defense Support of Civil Authorities  (DSCA),  AFI  10-2501,  Air  Force  Emergency  Management  (EM)  Program Planning and Operations and AFMAN 10-2502, Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) Standards and Procedures. 4.3.2.  All PWCS managers will build interoperability into every technical solution in an effort to bridge the gap between federal, state and local first responders. (T-1) 4.3.2.1.  Follow  Association  of  Public-Service  Communications  Officials  equipment standards and guidelines. 4.3.2.2.  The  US  Department  of  Homeland  Security  SAFECOM  project  provides solutions and additional information regarding this subject. 4.3.2.3.  Technical  solutions  have  to  adhere  to  rules  and  regulations  outlined  in  the NTIA  Manual,  AFI  17-220  and  state  and  local  laws.  NOTE:  AFI  33-118  is  now replaced by AFI 17-220 (December 2015) 4.4.  Encryption. 4.4.1.  Sensitive  But  Unclassified Communications (SBU)/For  Official  Use  Only (FOUO) 4.4.1.1.  SBU/FOUO communications do not require any encryption because they are not National Security Systems (NSS). See paragraph 4.4.2.1.1 4.4.1.2.  Devices  processing  SBU/FOUO  may  be  encrypted  using  standard  self-generated AES keys (Type 3/Type 4). 4.4.1.2.1.  The vast majority of LMRs do not require NSS level encryption. 4.4.1.2.2.  An IA Risk Assessment is recommended to identify vulnerabilities. 4.4.1.2.3.  Consider  base  first  responders  (SFS,  Medical,  EM,  Fire  Dept.)  obtain unclassified encryption capabilities to reduce SBU operations surveillance. 4.4.1.2.4.  Administrative  Control  per  Joint  Publication  1-02,  Department  of Defense  Dictionary  of  Military  and  Associated  Terms:  Direction  or  exercise  of authority over subordinate or other organizations in respect to administration and support,  including  organization  of  Service  forces,  control  of  resources  and equipment,  personnel  management,  Unit  logistics,  individual  and  unit  training, readiness, mobilization, demobilization, discipline, and other matters not included in the operational missions of the subordinate or other organizations. 4.4.1.3.  Generation  of  unclassified  Type  3/4  encryption  keys  are  authorized  at  field level using Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) certified devices. 4.4.1.3.1.  Unclassified  keys  of  this  type  should  follow  a  quarterly  supersession plan.  AFI17-210  26 MAY 2016 15 4.4.2.  NSS/Secret/Top Secret Communications 4.4.2.1.  NSS/Secret/Top  Secret  communications  require  AES  Type  1/Type  2 encryption. NSS communications are defined in 44 U.S.C. § 3542(b) (2)]: 4.4.2.1.1.  Any  information  system  (including  any  telecommunications  system) used  or  operated  by  an  agency  or  by  a  contractor  of  an  agency,  or  other organization on behalf of an agency whose function, operation, or use of which: involves  intelligence  activities;  involves  cryptologic  activities  related  to  national security;  involves  command  and  control  of  military  forces;  involves  equipment that  is  an  integral  part  of  a  weapon  or  weapons  system;  is  critical  to  the  direct fulfillment  of  military  or  intelligence  missions;  or  is  protected  at  all  times  by procedures  established  for  information  that  have  been  specifically  authorized under criteria established by an Executive order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. 4.4.2.1.2.  Additional  policy  concerning  NSI/NSS  may  be  obtained  from  the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) via http://www.cnss.gov/ . 4.4.2.1.3.  The definition of C2 can be found in Joint Publication 1-02. 4.4.2.2.  The following COMSEC Type 1/Type 2 capabilities are available: 4.4.2.2.1.  Suite A (Confidential thru Top Secret). 4.4.2.2.1.1.  This set of encryption keys is approved for US use only and is not releasable to any coalition personnel. 4.4.2.2.2.  Suite B (Confidential thru Top Secret). 4.4.2.2.2.1.  The emerging set of encryption keys is being developed for joint US/Coalition  use.    See  CNSS  Policy  (CNSSP)  15,  National  Information Assurance  Policy  on  the  Use  of  Public  Standards  for  the  Secure  Sharing  of Information Among National Security Systems guidance. 4.4.2.2.2.2.  Starting in October 2015 Suite B is expected to replace AES Type 1/Type  2  as  the  only  authorized  encryption  for  NSS/Secret/Top  Secret communications. 4.4.3.  Contact your MAJCOM A6 office or 38 CYRS/SCM for more information. 4.4.4.  Interoperability has to be incorporated into all technical decisions per AFPD 10-  8 and AFMAN 10-2502.  Thus, when considering encryption, leadership has to balance  the secure  communications  needs  and  ability  to  support  local,  state  and  other  federal   agencies during a mutual aid/crisis response. 4.4.5.  Ensure  encryption  capable  LMRs  and  key  management  devices  are  certified according to  FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements  for  Cryptographic Modules, FIPS 197, Advanced  Encryption  Standard,  and  FIPS  200,  Minimum  Security  Requirements  for Federal  Information  and  Information  Systems  according  to  the  National  Institute  of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines.   16 AFI17-210  26 MAY 2016 4.5.  PWCS ECO encryption responsibilities.  PWCS ECO will: 4.5.1.  Coordinate  with  the  wing  communications  security  (COMSEC)  manager  and  the requiring  unit’s  COMSEC  Responsible  Officer  (CRO)  on  all  technical  solutions  for PWCS assets requiring NSA Type 1 encryption-endorsed products per NSS guidance. (T-2). The COMSEC manager and CROs acquire and manage COMSEC material supporting PWCS assets containing NSA-approved encryption modules.  (See AFMAN 17-1302 for guidance). (T-3) 4.5.2.  Contact    appropriate    Combatant    Command    and/or    MAJCOM    authority    for specific  guidance  on  COMSEC  issues  relating  to  technical  solutions  for  commercial wireless operations outside the US&P. 4.5.3.  Ensure  technical  solutions,  which  include  COMSEC-equipped  PWCS  assets operated  or  maintained  by  Foreign  Nationals,  meet  approval  requirements  according  to AFMAN 17-1302, Communications Security (COMSEC) Operations, (FOUO). (T-1) 4.5.4.  Verify  asset  reportable,  COMSEC-equipped,  wing/base  PWCS  assets  are maintained  according  to  AFI  17-131,  Communications  Security  (COMSEC)  Equipment Maintenance and Maintenance Training; AFMAN 17-1302. (T-2) 4.5.5.  Verify all encryption modules are zeroized or encryption module is removed prior to turn-in for transfer, maintenance and disposal. (T-2) 4.6.  Intrinsically Safe. 4.6.1.  PWCS managers  will participate in  development of local  Intrinsically Safe  LMR operational  procedures  with  Base  Safety  and  Fire  Marshall  and  for  processing  use requirements through command safety channels. (T-2). 4.6.2.  Radios may have a green dot on them and may say “Intrinsically Safe;” however, that does not mean they have been certified as such.  A radio is considered Intrinsically Safe  when  the  battery  and  the  radio  itself  are  stamped  Factory  Mutual  (FM)  Approved Intrinsically Safe. 4.6.3.  Recertification occurs any time outer case has been breached in a manner, which exposes  internal  circuits  of  unit.    (This  does  not  include:  replacement  of  antenna; changing/replacing  battery  pack;  software  loaded  into  unit;  replacing  a  control  knob; replacing an escutcheon or belt clip).  If for any reason a radio needs repair, it then needs to be re-certified as FM Approved. 4.7.  Information Assurance. 4.7.1.  Contact local IA OPR and/or IA COP for guidance. 4.8.  LMR Life Cycle Support Planning: 4.8.1.  ECOs will annually review and validate a LMR LCSP to ensure that LMR systems and assets are renewed IAW AF direction and vendor support documentation. (T-2). 4.8.2.  A  LCSP  is  a  locally  generated  report  that  must  include  make,  model,  purchase date, purchase price and vendor support expiration date. 4.8.3.  Coordinate with vendor to determine expected life cycle length for their products. AFI17-210  26 MAY 2016 17 4.8.4.  Consider  replacement  of  LMR  assets  based  on  factors  such  as  age  of  system, mission requirements, and maintenance records. 4.8.5.  Use Attachment 10 as a tool for planning. 4.8.6.  MAJCOMs/Wings  will  coordinate  replacement  based  on  local  conditions  and mission needs being careful to achieve most efficient use of USAF dollars. (T-3). 4.8.7.  Bases may consider leasing systems as an option if it is in the best interests of the USAF,  and  does  not  violate  OPSEC  or  other  security  regulations,  and  fully  supports mission requirements. 4.8.8.  Provide  validated  reportable PWCS  Replacement  Plan  to  using  organizations  to  support budget planning decisions. Section C—Managing the AF Military Auxiliary Radio System (MARS) 5.  AF    MARS    General.  The  MARS  purpose  and  mission  can  be  found  in  DoDI  4650.02, Military  Auxiliary  Radio  System  (MARS),  published  by  DoD  Chief  Information  Officer  (CIO).

Overview.  As  the  PWCS  ECO,  one  of  your  most  important  tasks  is  to  determine  the technical  solution  that  best  satisfies  your  customer’s  communications  requirements.      This attachment provides a tool to assist your decision making process.  Requiring units/organizations may also use this tool to assist in preparing requirements documents. A2.2.  Existing Services.  PWCS ECO has to be aware of the wireless communications services currently  available  in  local  areas  to  determine  an  effective  technical  solution.    Sources  for  this information include: A2.2.1.  AFECO and MAJCOM PWCS Lead. A2.2.2.  Local telephone/cellular service providers. A2.2.3.  Electronics stores specializing in communications services/devices. A2.2.4.  Available  DoD  and  Air  Force  Enterprise  PWCS  contracts  such  as  Air  Force Enterprise IT Services. A2.2.5.  Trade and professional publications. A2.2.6.  AFNetOPS https://cs.eis.af.mil/a6/afnetops/default.aspx. Architecture Integrated Product team (AIPT) A2.2.7.  AFWay  and  Air  Force  NETCENTS  (https://afway.af.mil),  and  published  ITCC product list. A2.3.  Types  of Services.  Table A2.1 lists examples of the types of wireless services that may be considered when determining a technical solution. A2.4.  Determining  a  Technical  Solution.  Answer  the  questions  in  Figure  A2.1  using  the information contained in your customer’s requirement document.  This helps you determine the technology that may best fill their requirements.  After selecting a technology, you may need to contact local vendors to better define the actual device required.  When the selected solution is available  from  commercial  service  providers,  refer  to  the  i-TRM  and/or  Air  Force  Wireless Handheld Services and Devices Enterprise Agreements for approved products. A2.4.1.  Spectrum  Certification.  Any  hardware  procurement supportability to be addressed prior to obligation of funds. requires spectrum A2.5.  Trunked    LMR  Systems  . Before considering a TLMR System, you have to be able to answer “Yes” to the majority of the questions listed below: A2.5.1.  Are  there  other  federal  agencies  in  the  area  (within  30  kilometers)  that  would  be willing to share a TLMR. A2.5.2.  Does your base have more than 500 users, and/or 10 or more radio networks? A2.5.3.  Are  the  existing  radio  networks  overcrowded  and/or  restricted  in  number,  causing mission degradation? A2.5.4.  Are  you  able  to  obtain  new  frequency  authorizations  to  meet  demand  for  radio communications? AFI17-210  26 MAY 2016 33 A2.5.5.  Is  your  existing  conventional  LMR  network  experiencing  increased  levels  of interference due to frequency congestion in the area? A2.6.  Final  Considerations.  When preparing  a  technical  solution,  you  have to consider  the following: A2.6.1.  Can the selected device meet security requirements? A2.6.2.  Does  the  selected  device  allow  the  user  to    interoperate  with    the  required individuals/agencies?  (A communication device that doesn’t talk to  anyone else is  useless, no matter how many bells and whistles it has.) A2.6.3.  Does the selected solution make sense from a business perspective?  Does it save the Air Force money in the long run?  Is it in accordance with the ITCC commodity strategies? A2.6.4.  Does the selected solution fit into the Base Roadmap (formerly known as the Base Blueprint). A2.6.5.  If you answer “No” to any of these questions, you should reconsider your solution.   34 AFI17-210  26 MAY 2016 Table A2.1.  Types of Services.

This  wireless RF system is generally limited to a small building/office or campus area.   FRS Radio  ISR  An improved walkie talkie radio system and one of the Citizens’ Band radio services intended for use by members of a small team or work center to communicate among themselves.  Unregulated use of FRS radios within the US&P may replace LMRs for certain administrative communications, but cannot be used to transmit classified, SBU, command and control, operational, fire/crash, security or emergency response/medical communications.  Use of FRS radios outside the US&P is regulated by the host nation and may not be available for military use in this configuration. (See Para. 4.2  Family Radio Service (FRS) and Inter Squad Radio (ISR) Systems)  Short-range radios similar in construction and operational characteristics to FRS radios.  They are intended to be used among members of a squad.  Spectrum authorization has to be obtained through MAJCOM Spectrum Managers and the appropriate AFSPO or host nation prior to acquisition and use. (See Para. 4.2  Family Radio Service (FRS) and Inter Squad Radio (ISR) Systems) 36 AFI17-210  26 MAY 2016 Figure A2.1.

In  planning  for  PWCS  deployment,  the  base  CSO  and  PWCS  managers  advise  the wing/base and unit level planners to consider their PWCS requirements well in advance of any deployment. Other units have to plan for deployment anywhere. Some of the factors to consider are: A6.2.  Do  you  need  your  handheld  telecommunications  devices?  Can  the  host  base  satisfy  the requirement? A6.3.  Are  your in-garrison operating frequencies usable in  the deployed  host area? Coordinate overseas  requirements  through  MAJCOM  and  Air  Force  theater  command  frequency management offices. A6.4.  How do you maintain your deployed telecommunications devices? A6.5.  Do  you  need  spares?  What  is  the  probability  of  combat  damage  or  loss  in  transit  or handling? A6.6.  Do chargers work on host-nation or host-base power sources? (Voltages and frequencies vary by nation.) A6.7.  Do you need fixed/mobile base stations, repeaters, and antennas?  Should you preposition them, or do you carry and install them yourself? A6.8.  Do you need special procedures and call signs? A6.9.  Does  your  deployed  telecommunications  system  give  you  adequate  geographical coverage? A6.10.  Do you need encryption?  What method of encryption? (unclass/class). A6.11.  What about interoperability with other units? A6.12.  Is  your deploying telecommunications device spectrum certified for use at the intended deployment  locations?    Specifically,  is  the  device  capable  of  operating  within  host  base/host nation standards and technical parameters (i.e., frequency, channel spacing, power, etc.)? A6.13.  If  deploying  assets,  use  approved  AIS  for  inventory  transfer  to  gaining  unit  or  change status  to  “Deployed”.    Ensure  status  is  returned  to  “In  Use”  from  “Deployed”  status  once deployment period has ended. A6.14.  Develop  a  deployed  continuity  folder  by  tailoring  the  information  in  Attachment  2  to meet your requirements.  The base points of contact now become the deployed points of contact.  44 AFI17-210  26 MAY 2016 Attachment 7 CHECKLIST FOR MILITARY AUXILIARY RADIO SYSTEM (MARS) A7.1.

A replacement plan is a locally generated product which reflects some of the following: How long each asset has been in service, the original purchase price, and total repair cost spent on the asset. A10.2.  Each year the Base ECO will provide a copy of the validated PWCS Replacement Plan to  customer  organizations  to  support  budget  planning  decisions.    Consider  the  following  when formulating a logistic support plan for LMR assets: (T-3). A10.2.1.  Vendors  may  provide  expected  life  cycle  length  for  their  products.    This recommendation should be used in the replacement decision. A10.2.2.  Replacement  of  LMR  assets  are  based  on  several  factors  including  age  of asset/system, mission requirements, maintenance records, and cost. A10.2.3.  LMRs  (to  include  conventional/trunking  sites,  handhelds,  mobiles,  etc.)  typically have a useful life well beyond 5 years.  Replacing systems earlier than needed is wasteful and not in the best interests of the USAF. A10.2.4.  MAJCOMs/Wings  will  coordinate  replacement  based  on  local  conditions  and mission  needs  being  careful  to  achieve  the  most  efficient  use  of  USAF  dollars.    A10.2.5. Interoperability and encryption has to be considered in all upgrades and replacement of LMR systems. A10.2.5.  The  replacement  plan  may  use  a  point  system  to  assist  in  PWCS  replacement management based on average lifecycle of 10 years. A10.2.5.1.  The  point  system  aids  in  determining  items  that  are  candidates  for replacement.  The point assignments are as follows:  2 points per year of age (useful life), 3 points per repair action (reliability), and 5 points per year for phased out equipment (no longer supportable or procurable).
