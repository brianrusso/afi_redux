This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document identifying life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the histopathology specialty. The CFETP will provide histopathology personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.  NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions may use Part II to support duty position qualification training.    2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; both parts are used by supervisors to plan, manage, and control training within the career field.   2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains the purpose of the CFETP and how everyone will use the plan. Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path. Section C associates each skill level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other). Section D indicates resource constraints.  Examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities. Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for the ranks of SSgt through MSgt.   2.2.  Part II contains six sections. At the unit level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references (TRs) to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, core tasks, and correspondence course requirements. Section B contains the Course Objective List (COL) and training standards supervisors will use to determine if an Airman has satisfied training requirements. Section C identifies available support materials. An example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP) that may be developed to support proficiency training requirements.  Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses. Section E identifies Major Command (MAJCOM) unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. Section F outlines the format and documentation to maintain an Air Force Training Record (AFTR).  3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan enables us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.   4 Abbreviations/Terms Explained    Air Education and Training Command (AETC).

Purpose of the CFETP.  This CFETP provides information necessary for the AFCFM, MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, trainers and certifiers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  The plan outlines the training individuals in the 4T0X2 specialty should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career. This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.    1.1  Initial Skills Training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. For this AFSC, training is conducted by the Medical Education and Training Campus (METC) at Fort Sam Houston, TX.   1.2.  Upgrade Training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels.    1.3.  Qualification Training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.    1.4.  Advanced Training is formal specialty training used for selected Airmen.  1.5.  Proficiency Training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or OJT provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.    1.6.  The CFETP has several purposes, some are:    1.6.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program. In addition, it helps supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career.    1.6.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.    1.6.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method.    1.6.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training program.    2.  Uses of the CFETP.  The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.    2.1.  METC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident training based on  9 requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP. AETC training personnel will develop/revise non-resident, field, and exportable training.   2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements. Requirements are satisfied through OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses. MAJCOM developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into this CFETP.   2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.    3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority for the CFETP. In addition, the AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training. They will submit, through proper channels, initial and subsequent changes to the CFETP.

Training Decisions.  The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the 4T0X2 career field. The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet training requirements. The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training. The following training decisions were made during the AFSC 4T0X2 Utilization and Training Workshop, held 29 Sep 2015 at Fort Sam Houston, TX.    3.1.  Initial Skills Training.  The Histopathology Apprentice course must meet the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS) guidelines. The initial skills course provides Airmen the needed education and training skills necessary to become 3-skill level apprentices. Significant changes to the course will include adding 3-skill level training on Cytology Processing, Telepathology, and Immunohistochemistry.   3.2.  5-Skill Level.  During the STRT, voting members elected to add 5-skill level tasks to formal training as an upgrade requirement in an effort to standardize on-the-job training and to provide Airmen with fundamental AFS career knowledge. The 5-skill level CDC will be required 12 for histopathology technicians seeking their 4T052 AFSC.  The 5-skill level CDC will be developed by the 937 TRG, Fort Sam Houston, TX. If CDCs are unavailable, supervisors are required to identify knowledge items in the CFETP Part II, CDC Column. If a CDC becomes available after entering UGT, the individual does not have to take the CDC unless specified by the AFCFM. The member’s commander awards the 5-skill level upon successful completion of the 5-skill level CDC volumes (if available), satisfactory performance during OJT, and a minimum of 12-months time in upgrade training.    3.3.  7-Skill Level. Voting members agreed to create core tasks for 7-skill level upgrade training. All related tasks provide supervisors with the proper training of managing technicians within a laboratory.  The member’s commander awards the 7-skill level upon successful completion of core tasks, satisfactory performance during OJT, and a minimum of 12-months in upgrade training.  4.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  CCAF is one of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions; however, it is the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military enlisted personnel. The college is regionally accredited through Air University by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degrees designed for specific Air Force occupational specialties and is the largest multi-campus community college in the world. Upon completion of basic military training and assignment to an AF career field, all enlisted personnel are registered in a CCAF degree program and are afforded the opportunity to obtain an AAS degree. In order to be awarded, degree requirements must be successfully completed before the student separates from the AF, retires, or is commissioned as an officer. See the CCAF website for details regarding the AAS degree programs.  4.1.  Degree Requirements.  All enlisted Airmen are automatically entered into the CCAF program. Prior to completing an associate degree, the 5-level must be awarded and the following requirements must be met:       Technical Education...................................................................................24 Leadership, Management, and Military Studies ..........................................6 Physical Education .......................................................................................4 General Education ....................................................................................15* Program Elective ......................................................................................15* Total: 64 Semester Hours    *Note: The Histologic Technology degree requires 18 semester hours (SH) of general education (addition of a 3 SH general education elective) and 12 SH of program elective.  4.1.1.

Section D - Resource Constraints    16.  Purpose.  This section identifies known resource constraints, which preclude optimal and desired training from being developed or conducted, including information such as cost and manpower. Narrative explanations of each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint has on training are included. Also included in this section are actions required, office of primary responsibility, and target completion dates. Resource constraints will be, at a minimum, reviewed and updated annually.    17.  Apprentice 3-Skill Level Training.  No 3-skill level resource constraints exist.    20 18.  Journeyman 5-Skill Level Training.  18.1.  Constraints.  Autopsy Procedures core tasks for upgrade to the journeyman level will require Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) with autopsy capabilities. Not all MTFs have autopsy suites available.  18.2.  Impact.  Trainees in 5-skill level UGT will not be able to complete the following Autopsy Procedures core tasks: 16.1.1, 16.2, 16.4.1, and 16.4.2.  18.3.  Resources Required.  Autopsy Suite  18.4.  Action Required. If capability does not exist to perform autopsies at the assigned base, the unit will make every effort to have trainee perform core tasks within the local area.  If every effort has been exhausted and the core tasks cannot be completed, document the reason the core tasks were not conducted in the trainees training record.  18.5.  OPR/Target Completion Date.  N/A  19.  Craftsman 7-Skill Level Training.  No 7-skill level resource constraints exist.   Section E - Transitional Training Guide – There currently is no transition training requirement.  This area is reserved.                          21 PART II   Section A - Specialty Training Standard (STS)  1.  Implementation. The STS will be used for technical training provided by the Medical Education and Training Campus (METC) for the 3-skill level Education and Training Apprentice course with the class beginning no earlier than 05 Jul 2016 and graduating 20 Sep 2016. The 4T052 CDC Need Date (date the CDC is available to the field) is 5 Jan 2018. All other portions are effective immediately upon publication.  2.  Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201 and the STS:  2.1.  Lists in Column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies specialty-wide training requirements.  2.2.  Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements. Use the automated Air Force Training Record (AFTR) to document technician qualifications.  2.3.  Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Columns 4A, 4B, and 4C are used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and the CDC. Training for these tasks is achieved through OJT and completion of appropriate CDC. Column 4D identifies required core tasks with associated Qualification Training Packages (QTPs).  2.4.  Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and CDCs.   2.5.  Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for OJT when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Form, and used according to AFI 36-2201. When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  2.5.1.  Documentation. Consult AFI 36-2201 for documentation questions and issues.  2.5.2.  Training Standard.  For OJT, tasks are trained and qualified to the “go/no go” level. Do not use proficiency codes for OJT. These codes are used strictly for the in residence 3-skill level and the 5-skill level CDC. “Go” means the individual is capable and competent to perform tasks without assistance and meets local demands for performance, accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures.  2.6. Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the AETC Airman Advancement Division, by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog (EPRRC). 22 Individual responsibilities are in Chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System.  3.

Resident Courses. If a written list of the course objectives is required, contact the Histopathology Apprentice course training manager by using the 937TRG/TGE Customer Service Information Line (CSIL) at DSN: 420-1080, COMM: 210-808-1080, or email at usaf.jbsa.937-trg.list.937-trg-tge@mail.mil.   2.  Measurement.  Students are measured in both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress check.  3.  Standard.  The course minimum standard is 70% on written examinations. Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist. Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.  4.  Proficiency Level.  Most course task performance is taught to the 2b proficiency level, which means the student can do most parts of the task but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.    5.  Initial Medical Readiness Training. As directed by AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Program Management, initial medical readiness training is provided within the Expeditionary Readiness Course (EMRC), which is conducted through the 937th Training Group at Camp Bullis, TX.   6.  Career Development Courses (CDC). CDC information can be obtained from the Air Force Career Development Academy, formerly the Extension Course Institute, at Maxwell AFB, Gunter Annex, AL or by contacting the CDC Writer/Manager at the schoolhouse using the  937 TRG/TGE Customer Service Information Line (CSIL) at DSN: 420-1080, COMM: 210-808-1080, or email at usaf.jbsa.937-trg.list.937-trg-tge@mail.mil.
