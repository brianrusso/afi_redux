Conventional Munitions Serviceability and Product Assurance.  Assurance of munitions reliability  is  essential  to  effective  air  and  ground  operations  in  support  of  training  and  combat operations.  The key elements of munitions reliability are Aging and Surveillance (A&S) testing, periodic surveillance inspections, specific event inspection/testing (e.g., pre- or post-use, receipt, shipping, and special).  These processes ensure fielded munitions systems perform according to design  specification  at  the  intended  point-of-use.    Suspect  assets  are  segregated  prior  to  use, issue, or delivery. 3.1.1.  General  Product  Assurance  Duties  and  Responsibilities.  All  munitions activities, flights,  and  munitions-using  organizations  execute  the  following  key  Product  Assurance duties and responsibilities: 3.1.1.1.

(T-2).    The  term  “drawing  number”  will  be  used  when  referring  to  SPI, Certification  of  Equivalency,  Competent  Authority  Approval,  or  equivalent  numbers  to provide visibility of non-accountable reusable containers throughout the Air Force. (T-2). 3.3.2.9.1.  If no NSN exists, a local NSN will be created IAW paragraph 7.1.7 when entering  non-accountable  container  information.  (T-2).  Enter  the  drawing  number with  no  spaces  (include  dashes)  as  the  lot  number,  and  appropriate  Controlled Inventory Item Code (CIIC).  Enter structure and location designators as identified in the  unit’s  Movement  Control  OI.   Quantity  is  the  total  container  quantity  for  each drawing  number,  structure,  and  location  combination.  The  remaining  fields  are  at unit discretion.  Container quantities will be updated as changes occur. (T-2). 3.3.2.9.2.

NAF  or  MAJCOM  munitions  staff  approval  will  be  obtained  before  using  Air Force  owned  MILVAN  containers  for  anything  other  than  shipment  or  storage  of munitions  items.  (T-1).  MILVAN  containers  will  not  be  used  as  a  permanent  fix  for facility shortfalls. (T-1). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   31  3.4.2.  Maintaining MILVAN Serviceability.  Units will maintain containers in serviceable condition for munitions redistribution or storage at all times to include Convention for Safe Containers (CSC) certification currency on Air Force owned containers. (T-1). 3.4.2.1.  Containers  will  not  be  used  to  store  equipment  or  materials  (liquids,  acids, batteries, etc.) that would render them non-certifiable under the CSC or place holes in any part of a container. (T-1). 3.4.2.2.  Accomplish blocking and bracing IAW applicable Defense Ammunition Center (DAC) drawings available at the DAC website. (T-0). 3.4.2.3.  Place  containers  on  drained,  hardstand  surfaces  with  all  four  lower  castings placed on blocks (dunnage) 4 to 6 inches high when removed from a chassis. (T-1).  This properly  distributes  weight  through  corner  castings  and  prevents  debris  from  exerting pressure against lower structural members of the container and allows air circulation that will  prevent  moisture  damage  to  the  container.    Containers  may  be  temporarily  placed directly on a paved hardstand for stuffing and unstuffing operations. 3.4.2.4.  Empty containers will not  be stacked  more than three high; a minimum of  two stacking/locking  pins  will  be  inserted  in  the  counter-checked  position  on  opposing corners when stacked. (T-0). 3.4.2.5.  Once  empty  containers  are  inspected  and  verified  empty,  a  numbered  seal  will be placed on each container to provide for security, integrity, and accountability. (T-1). 3.4.3.  MILVAN Inspection and Certification. 3.4.3.1.

The  DAC  conducts  the  in-resident  CSC  certification  course.    CSC  distance learning  course (Ammo-43-DL) is also available on the DAC website and is  authorized for CSC initial and refresher training/certification for Air Force personnel. 3.4.4.  Budgeting for MILVAN Costs. 3.4.4.1.  When  Air  Force  owned  MILVAN  containers  are  used  for  local  storage  of munitions  assets,  munitions  components,  or  munitions  equipment,  maintenance  and repair of Air Force owned ISO containers are a PEC 28030 expense. (T-1).  In this case, units shall budget annually for container maintenance and inspection costs. (T-1). 3.4.4.2.  Costs  to  train  and  qualify  munitions  personnel  to  maintain,  inspect,  and  certify MILVANS (organic/contract) periodically or prior to munitions loading are a PEC 28030 expense. (T-1).   32  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 3.4.4.3.  Only  perform  general  maintenance  on  Air  Force  owned  containers.  (T-2).    If required,  contracts  may  be  established  for  tasks  the  owning  activity  cannot  perform (certified welding, complete floor replacement, etc.). 3.4.4.4.  Maximum  one-time  and  total  repair  costs  will  not  exceed  the  Maintenance Expenditure Limit (MEL) criteria in DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part  VI,  Management  and  Control  of  Intermodal  Containers  and  System  463L Equipment,  Chapter  604,  Intermodal  Container  Inspection,  Reinspection,  Maintenance, And  Repair.  (T-0).    Request  disposition  instructions  when  repair  cost  exceeds  DTR limits. (T-0).  ACAMS determines ownership. 3.4.5.  Accounting for MILVANs. 3.4.5.1.  Account  for,  ship,  and  manage  Air  Force  owned  ISO  container  records  in ACAMS IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part IV and AFI 24-203. (T-0). 3.4.5.2.  All  Air  Force  munitions  activities  that  possess  and  maintain  ISO/MILVAN containers  shall  ensure  ISO  containers  in  their  possession  are  not  loaded  on  CAS accountable records as an asset, or in MC2 for accounting purposes. (T-1).  All received ISO container records and maintenance records will be input into ACAMS. (T-1). 3.4.5.3.  If ownership of ISO containers cannot be determined locally, or using ACAMS, contact  the  Air  Force  Intermodal  Container  Manager,  Air  Force  Sustainment  Center (AFSC/LOET). (T-1). 3.4.5.4.  Load the ISO as container type “ISO” in CAS when used to ship or store CAS-managed munitions assets to allow for CAS Container-in-Container (CnC) management using Container Maintenance (AM106A) program IAW paragraph 7.1.5. (T-1). Note: Loading an ISO/ MILVAN in CAS as container type “ISO” does not pick the container up on accountable records.  It only enables management of other assets with the “ISO” container. 3.4.6.  Requesting Repair and Disposition of MILVANs. 3.4.6.1.  Non-Air  Force owned MILVANs:   Report to  SDDC IAW  DTR 4500.9-R, Part VI,  Chapter  604,  Intermodal  Container  Inspection,  Reinspection,  Maintenance,  and Repair. (T-0).

(T-1). 3.6.3.  Determining  Classification  of  Munitions  Information.  Executive  Order  (E.O.) 12958  mandates  that  the  Original  Classification  Authority  (OCA)  determines  whether damage to national security would result and the level of damage that would reasonably be expected to be cause from unauthorized disclosure of information.  The OCA must be able to identify  and  describe  the  damage.  Munitions  Information  Classification  Rules  listed  in Table  3.1,  Munitions  Information  Classification  Rules  do  not  address  all  possible combinations of information, but serve as a guide.  Table  3.2, General Classification Rules outlines general classification designations for munitions information. 3.6.3.1.  Security  classification  guides  are  developed  IAW  DoDM  5200.01,  DoD Information  Security  Program:  Overview,  Classification,  and  Declassification,  Vol.  1, Enclosure  6.    PMs  will  coordinate  weapons-specific  security  classification  guides affecting munitions or missile systems or their end-items with AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-C prior  to  publication  or  update.    The  PM  is  responsible  to  ensure  that  weapon  specific security  classification  guides  are  develop,  updated,  and  posted  on  the  GACP   34  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 website.  Weapon  specific  security  classification  guides  take  precedence  over  security classification guidance in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2. 3.6.3.2.  Three primary terms are used in munitions classification determination.  Proper use of these terms will avoid unnecessary classification: 3.6.3.2.1.  Requirements:    The  Non-nuclear  Consumables  Annual  Analysis  (NCAA) and  Tactical  Air  Missile  Program  (TAMP)  documents  calculate  requirements  for munitions  to  support  unified  commander  missions  under  the  methodology  in  DoDI 3000.04, DoD Munitions Requirements Process (MRP).  The WCDO indicates the by base  distribution  of  the  NCAA  and  TAMP  Combined  Theater  Requirement  (CTR) data.  Requirements are normally classified by the OCA using the logic rules outlined in the Table 3.1 and Table 3.2. 3.6.3.2.2.  Allocations:    The  approved  quantity  of  munitions  items  allocated  to  a command,  theater,  or  base  stock  record  account.    Allocations  and  associated requisitions are normally unclassified. 3.6.3.2.3.  Quantity:    The  on-hand amount  of  munitions  available  at  any  given  time.  Refer  to  weapons  specific  classification  guides  for  classification  of  quantity information.  When items in the paragraphs below are not discussed or included, on-hand  quantities  are  normally  unclassified.    On-hand  quantities  used  in  association with any of the items below will be classified as SECRET or above. (T-0). 3.6.3.2.3.1.  References (CONPLAN). (T-0). to  a  specific  plan,  OPLAN,  or  Concept  Plan 3.6.3.2.3.2.

(T-2). 3.8.1.2.  Maximize the use of the Air Force Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide located on the Air Force Conventional Munitions SharePoint® site (see Training Tools / Guides tab) when developing local training programs. (T-2). 3.8.2.  Munitions Qualification Training.  Training to achieve proficiency, experience, and skill  in  mandatory,  wartime,  core,  and  supervisor  assigned  tasks;  and  to  enable  skill  level upgrade IAW the 2W0X1 Munitions Systems CFETP.   3.8.2.1.  The  focus  of  qualification  training  is  on  technical  tasks  such  as  checkout, operation,  organizational  level  use  and  maintenance  of  assigned  munitions,  tools,  test, handling  equipment,  vehicles,  and  facilities.  Qualification  training  may  also  include specific  home  station  training,  deployment/UTC  task  requirements,  and  other  Air  Force unique specialized certification requirements. 3.8.2.2.

CMT  Program.  The  CMT  program  is  designed to  provide  hands-on  familiarization training to develop core knowledge for all 2W0XX and company grade officers assigned to the  MUNS/Munitions  Flight.  CMT  is  not  intended  to  fully  qualify  personnel  in  all  tasks.  The  unit's  conventional  munitions  mission  or  OPLAN  tasking  (in-place  or  deployed)  has primary  emphasis  in  the  CMT  program  and  includes  all  facets  of  the  munitions  support mission,  accountability,  and  CAS  processes.    Munitions  Supervision  is  responsible  for establishing and implementing an effective CMT program and shall: (T-1)   AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   39  3.8.3.1.  Direct  the  Training  Section/element  NCOIC  in  all  stages  of  CMT  program development. (T-2). 3.8.3.2.  Ensure  CMT  training  utilizes  standard  CAS  screens  and  CAS  help  screens  to promote proficiency in CAS transaction processing. (T-2). 3.8.3.3.  Ensure  CMT  programs  develop  cross-functionality  in  the  use  of  personnel between munitions workcenters to the maximum extent possible. (T-3). 3.8.3.4.  Ensure  Munitions  Supervision  (e.g.,  Capt,  Lt,  CMSgt,  and  SMSgt)  participates in  CMT.    Supervision  participation  shall  focus  on  leadership,  mentorship,  hands-on review, and adaptation of the CMT curriculum at the point of instruction. (T-3). 3.8.3.5.  Develop a task-training list used to manage training for all contingency tasks and operations.  (T-3).    The  task-training  list  will  identify  the  task  to  be  instructed  and  the frequency  (18  month  maximum).  Because  supporting  tasks  are  equally  critical,  the MUNS  Superintendent  or  Flight  Chief  may  designate  personnel  that  only  require  CMT training on supporting tasks as identified on the task-training list. 3.8.3.6.  Determine  the  number  of  personnel  (total  number  or  percentage  of  assigned) required to train on each contingency task to meet the unit's most demanding contingency requirements. (T-3). When developing the task training list, number of personnel to train, and frequency of training consider the following: 3.8.3.6.1.  The  usage  and  type  of  tasked  munitions  from  the  UCML,  weapons  task qualification listing, ITO, aircrew training syllabus, and OPLANs. (T-3). 3.8.3.6.2.  Collateral mission tasking, BSP, and ESP. (T-3). 3.8.3.6.3.  The criticality of supporting tasks. (T-3). 3.8.3.6.4.  The complexity, frequency, and duration of tasks performed. (T-3). 3.8.3.6.5.  The  need  for  flexibility  in  the  use  of  personnel  during  contingency operations. (T-3). 3.8.3.6.6.  The scheduling and the availability of personnel. (T-3). 3.8.3.7.  Develop  and  coordinate  CMT  training  outlines  with  Wing  Safety  and  QA  (or equivalent)  for  ground/weapons  safety  adequacy  and  technical  accuracy;  the  MASO  to promote  standardization  of  CAS local logistics/maintenance training flight to ensure the course curriculum and training outlines meet requirements of AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional Systems Development. (T-2). tasks  and  processes;  and  with the 3.8.3.8.  Ensure  all  2W0XX  personnel  assigned  outside  the  Munitions  Squadron/Flight attend  CMT  at  intervals  designated  by  the  MUNS  Superintendent/Flight  Chief.  (T-3).   This  enables  munitions  personnel  to  retain  familiarization  on  core  munitions  tasks and  meet  combat  training  requirements  of  the  2W0X1  Munitions  Systems  CFETP  and training  outlined  by  the  Munitions  Superintendent/Flight  Chief  in  the  Master  Task Listing.   40  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 3.8.3.9.

(T-0).  Any  proposed  exception  from the Act must be fully approved, in writing by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and provided to the local JA for legal review and advice to the Commander of the storing activity before the munitions storage activity accepts untagged PE items for storage. (T-0). 3.12.  Disposition  of  Munitions.  Refer to  paragraph  9.6 for DoD level munitions  disposition guidance. 3.12.1.  The  DoD  Military  Munitions  Rule  (MR).  The  DoD  Military  Rule  (MR) (hereinafter referred to as MR) amended Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations  requiring  Waste  Military  Munitions  (WMM)  to  be  managed  as  a  hazardous waste.  The MR is a federal standard.  Each state may either adopt the MR or choose to enact a  state  MR  regulation  that  is  more  stringent  than  the  Federal  regulation.    Therefore,  each installation,  led  by  its  Civil  Engineering  Squadron  environmental  function,  and  in coordination with its servicing legal office, must interact closely with the service appointed regional  environmental  coordinators  (REC)  to  determine  and  understand  the  extent  of  state (or  territory)  adoption  and  compare  it  to  the  EPA  MR  and  DoD  Military  Munitions  Rule (MR)  Implementation  Procedures.  (T-0).    IAW  the  DoD  MR  all  military  munitions  in  the active inventory, war reserve stocks, and assigned an appropriate condition code for a valid military  purpose  are  not  WMM  because  they  have  not  been  discarded,  abandoned  or otherwise disposed of. 3.12.2.  Storage  of  WMM.  Storage  standards  for  WMM  storage  are  established  in  DoD 6055.09-M,  DoD  Ammunition  and  Explosives  Safety  Standards,  Vol.  1–8.    Process  any request to waiver these requirements IAW DoD 6055.09-M. 3.12.2.1.  Storage of Non-DoD Munitions/Explosives.  Unless specifically authorized by Title  10  (U.S.C.),  Section  2692,  AFI  32-9003,  Granting  Temporary  Use  of  Air  Force Real Property, and AFMAN 91-201, Air Force units are prohibited from storing, treating, or  disposing  of  non-DoD  owned  munitions/explosives.    If  not  otherwise  allowed  or exempted,  forward  requests  to  store  non-DoD  munitions/explosives  to  the  appropriate waiver authority. (T-0). 3.12.2.2.  Storage  of  Commercial  Munitions/Explosives:    When  authorized  by  Title  10, U.S.C.,  Section  2692,  Air  Force  munitions  units  can  temporarily  store  or  EOD  units dispose  of  unused  commercial  munitions  or  explosives  that  have  been  confiscated  by federal, State, or local law enforcement agencies. 3.12.2.2.1.  Anytime  an  Air  Force  installation  is  requested  to  store  or  dispose  of commercial  munitions  or  explosives,  regardless  of  the  source,  it  must  ensure  that  a MOA is provided to address storage and management of the munitions through final disposition. (T-0).   48  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 3.12.2.2.2.  When  specifically  authorized  or  approved  to  store  WMM,  non-DoD owned,  or  commercial  munitions/explosives,  munitions  storage  activities  managed and maintained by the Air Force activities (active, guard, reserve, or contracted) shall provide  appropriate  safety,  security,  and  accountability  over  these  assets,  unless otherwise prohibited. (T-1). 3.12.2.2.3.  If  required  safety,  security,  and  accountability  requirements  cannot  be satisfied, Air Force units shall consult with the installation environmental, safety, and legal offices and through appropriate command channels. (T-0). 3.12.2.2.4.  When other U.S. Government (USG) agencies, military services, foreign country,  and  contractor  owned  munitions/explosives  are  otherwise  approved  or authorized  for  storage,  management  of  these  items  on  the  stock  record  account  in Accountable CAS is authorized. 3.12.3.  Disposition  of  Recovered  WMM.  Recovered  WMM  are  either  recovered  military munitions determined by EOD IAW AFI 32-3001, EOD Program to require a Level 1 or 2 emergency response or recovered military munitions designated by the appropriate Air Force Designated  Disposition  Authority  (DDA),  Conventional  Munitions  –  Hill  AFB  or  Air Superiority  Missiles  (ASM)  -  Robins  AFB,  as  not  acceptable  for  any  useful  purpose  and requires routine disposition. (T-0). 3.12.3.1.  A  “Level  1”  emergency  response  (Immediate  Response)  involves  a  recovered explosive item that  is not  safe to transport or store and typically requires immediate in-place  destruction.    A  Level  1  response  is  directed  by  the  Installation  Commander  and does  not  require  DDA  approval  prior  to  disposal.    A  Level  1  emergency  response  item shall never be transported to or stored in the MSA. 3.12.3.2.  A  “Level  2”  emergency  response  (Imminent  and  Substantial  Endangerment Response) involves a recovered explosive item that is not immediately dangerous and can be  temporarily  transported  and  stored  awaiting  state  notification  or  permits  for  local destruction.  A Level 2 response is directed by the Installation Commander and does not require  DDA  approval  prior  to  disposal.    When  Level  2  emergency  response  item  is turned  over  to  the  MSA  for  temporary  storage,  the  EOD  specialist  will  annotate “IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT RESPONSE (Level 2)” on the Found on Base (FOB) Turn-in document. 3.12.3.3.  A “Routine” response involves a recovered explosive item that is declared safe, is  excess,  obsolete,  or  has  non-hazardous  damage  beyond  economical  repair.    An  Air Force DDA is the only approval authority for “Routine” disposition of military munitions items as WMM.  When a Routine response item is turned over to the MSA for storage, the EOD specialist will annotate “ROUTINE” on the FOB turn-in document. 3.12.3.4.  When on-hand, issued, or in-use military munitions are turned-in, inspected, or used  and  subsequently  identified  as  unserviceable,  excess,  obsolete,  or  have  non-hazardous damage beyond economic repair, munitions personnel will request disposition from a DDA IAW paragraph 3.12.15. (T-0). 3.12.4.  EPA  or  State  Authorization  to  Treat  WMM.  Installations  can  be  EPA  or  state authorized for treatment of WMM as RCRA hazardous waste in specified Open Burn/Open Detonation (OB/OD) units. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   49  3.12.4.1.  Where  a  treatment  permit  has  been  issued  or  interim  status  pre-permitting authorization  obtained  by  the  installation,  WMM  will  be  managed  IAW  the  EPA/state permit or interim status rules. (T-0). 3.12.4.2.  If the EPA or state environmental regulatory agency does not grant a permit for disposal/treatment  of  WMM  or  provide  other  authorization, installation environmental  function,  in  coordination  with  the  legal  office,  shall  immediately  elevate the  issue  to  the  appropriate  MAJCOM  munitions  staff  and  regional  environmental support function under the AFCEC for resolution. (T-0). the 3.12.5.  DDAs.  DDAs  are  designated  in  writing  by  the  Product  Group  Manager  and  have final disposition authority. (T-1).  The Air Force DDA for conventional munitions other than ASM is at Hill AFB.  The Air Force DDA for ASM is at Robins AFB. 3.12.6.  Identification  of  WMM.  Units  will  not  identify  unused  military  munitions  as WMM  unless  authorized  by  an  Air  Force  DDA,  EOD  (Level  1/2  Response),  or  the installation commander. (T-1). 3.12.6.1.  Only  when  directed  by  a  DDA  to  identify  a  munitions  item  as  WMM,  units shall assign CC-V, Unserviceable (waste military munitions) to track WMM from point of  generation  through  final  disposition  and  comply  with  all  applicable  environmental requirements. (T-0). 3.12.6.2.  When  a  munitions  asset  is  declared  WMM  during  an  emergency  or  routine response,  EOD  (Level  1)  or  the  munitions  activity  (Level  2  and  Routine)  will immediately  request  the  installation  environmental  function  obtain  the  necessary  permit or  oral  authorization  from  Federal,  State  and/or  local  authorities.  (T-0).    Oral authorizations  must  be  documented  by  the  installation  environmental  office  who  must follow-up with the agency to assure a complete record is maintained. (T-0). 3.12.7.  Installation Civil Engineering Squadron - Environmental Unit or Function.  All activities  that  manage  WMM  shall  consult  with  the  base  environmental  function  and servicing legal officer to determine the applicable Federal, State, and local laws. (T-0). 3.12.7.1.  Refer all administrative, regulatory, permit, legal, and policy conflicts/disputes to  the  local  environmental  and  legal  offices  for  resolution  with  the  appropriate Federal/State  authority. (T-0).  The  installation  shall  seek  guidance  from  the  AFCEC regional  environmental  function  and  legal  office,  and  then  as  appropriate  or  advised, elevate to the appointed DOD REC for resolution. (T-1).  Meanwhile, installation should continue to comply with all applicable environmental laws and permit conditions pending resolution of any conflict. (T-0).  In resolving conflicts, protection of life and explosive safety will be the primary concern of the decision-maker and AFMAN 91-201 standards will remain in effect pending resolution. 3.12.7.2.  OCONUS  locations  shall  follow  the  environmental  requirements  in  MR  and this  AFI  unless  a  conflict  exists  with  host-nation  laws  or  governing  standards,  DoD Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document, or Status of Forces Agreements. (T-0). 3.12.8.  Periodic Safety Evaluation.  Annually, the munitions activity will request EOD re-evaluate  munitions  from  Level  2  emergencies  that  are  in  temporary  storage  awaiting   50  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 destruction  permits  to  ensure  they  have  not  become  an  immediate  hazard  (e.g.,  Level  1 emergency response). (T-0).  Contact the supporting EOD unit immediately when the safety of munitions assets is in question. (T-0). 3.12.9.  Disposition of Excess Munitions. 3.12.9.1.  Report serviceable excess via the automated serviceable excess program on the GACP website.  Refer to the User's Guide posted under the serviceable excess link.  (T-2).  MASOs shall only report Master Subsidiary Relationship Group (MSRG) serviceable excess  when  unique  circumstances  exist  (e.g.,  mission  changes,  Base  Realignment  and Closure, construction projects that impact capacity, loss of NEW). (T-2). 3.12.9.2.  MSRG excess shall not be reported if current allocations or future requirements exist. (T-2). 3.12.9.3.  OCONUS  units  must  obtain  MAJCOM  concurrence  before  reporting  MSRG excess. (T-1). 3.12.10.  Disposition of DoD Stock-listed Munitions. 3.12.10.1.  When  DoD  stock-listed  conventional  munitions,  missiles,  and  related explosive  components  become  unserviceable  at  base  level,  the  intent  of  the  DoD  is  to ship  assets to the appropriate location for further evaluation/screening for recycling and other utility before final disposition. 3.12.10.2.  Only an Air Force DDA can designate munitions as WMM and direct use of CC-V. 3.12.10.3.  When a DDA designates a  munition/explosive as  WMM  (e.g., directs use  of CC-V), installation  environmental  compliance manager/environmental office is made aware of the specific disposition instructions. shall  ensure the  DDA the 3.12.10.4.  Segregate WMM from serviceable/other unserviceable assets. (T-1). 3.12.10.5.  Separate storage facilities are not required for munitions designated as WMM provided  that  all  requirements  of  the  MR  or  applicable  state  law  are  met  and  DoD Explosive Safety Board  (DDESB) standards are followed. (T-1). 3.12.10.6.  Clearly  mark  waste  munitions.  (T-1).    Such  identification  may  be  by individual unit, pallet load, igloo, etc. 3.12.10.7.  The  MR  provides  that  munitions  which  are  stored  in  compliance  with  all requirements  of  the  MR,  including  the  requirement  to  meet  DDESB  standards,  are  not considered ‘waste’ by EPA until the munitions leave the magazine door enroute to a non-military owned or operated treatment, storage, or disposal facility. (T-0). 3.12.10.8.  The MR provides that munitions that are deteriorated or damaged to the point that  the  munitions  cannot  be  put  into  a  serviceable  condition,  and  cannot  reasonably  be recycled  or  used  for  other  purposes,  are  WMM  while  in  storage.   When  deteriorated  or damaged  munitions  are  identified,  munitions  supervision  ensures  that  Environmental Function is notified to determine if the state or territory has adopted the MR Conditional Exemption  for  storage  and  to  ensure  the  required  regulatory  notifications  are  made. (T-0).  If  the  Conditional  Exemption  is  not  available,  the  supporting  EOD  unit  will  be contacted to address the WMM as an emergency response (Level 1 or Level 2). (T-0). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   51  3.12.10.9.  Unserviceable  and  non-repairable  inert  munitions  items  and  accessories with DEMIL code other than ‘F’ and valued at $500 or less per item, which cannot be used  for  local  training,  may  be  approved  for  disposal  by  the  MASO  using  the  CAS ADR process.

Disposition of DoD Non-Stock-listed Munitions. 3.12.11.1.  MASOs  may  authorize  local  disposition  of  RDT&E  assets,  or  excess  items that have been used in research and development projects/tests if project managers cannot return  them  to  an  original  configuration  (L10  stock-listed  items).   Project  managers  are responsible  for  and  shall  provide  disposition  instructions  for  all  costs  associated  with disposal. (T-1). 3.12.11.2.  Assets  subjected  to  temperature  treatment,  vibration,  or  impact  testing (regardless  of  stock-listed  status)  are  considered  unserviceable  will  not  be  returned  for issue or redistribution. (T-0). 3.12.11.3.  After a non-stock-listed munitions item has been used/considered for use in a test or evaluation program, the test project manager shall ensure the asset is evaluated to determine its safety and proper identification. (T-1).  Project managers are responsible for costs  associated  with  obtaining  proper  safety/identification  evaluation  if  this  cannot  be determined by local agencies. (T-1). 3.12.11.3.1.  If assets cannot be properly identified, meet Hazard Classification (HC) requirements,  DOT  requirements,  or  otherwise  accepted  for  another  program  they should, on a case-by-case, be considered for local treatment/demilitarization. (T-1). 3.12.11.3.2.  If the safety of an asset (from a storage and handling aspect) cannot be determined  with  certainty,  treat  the  asset  as  a  Level  2  response  and  coordinate  its treatment/disposal  with  the  base  environmental  function,  EOD,  and  the  appropriate Air  Force  DDA.  (T-0).    The  installation  commander  has  the  final  disposition authority. (T-0). 3.12.12.  Disposition of COTS, Non-Stock-listed, Military Munitions. 3.12.12.1.

If  local  stock  numbers  are  assigned,  list  a  DoD  stock-listed  item that  the  COTS  munitions  asset  is  closely  related  to  (i.e.,  shotgun  shells,  9mm  hollow-point) in the remarks section. 3.12.12.2.  Commanders  have  ‘cradle-to-grave’  responsibility  for  COTS  munitions purchased at the local level that are not approved for munitions system management, but have  received  Non-Nuclear  Munitions  Safety  Board  (NNMSB)  approval.  (T-1).    This   52  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 includes  all  use  outside  the  MSA  and  final  disposition  of  malfunctions,  residue,  and excess. 3.12.13.  Disposition of Non-Stock-listed, Non-Military Munitions. 3.12.13.1.  When munitions found on base or turned in from amnesty boxes are delivered to  the  MSA,  munitions  personnel  will  ensure  that  EOD  or  Security  Forces  Squadron (SFS)  have  determined  whether  item(s)  are  derived  from  any  military source.  (T-1).    If this determination can  be  made  with  certainty,  follow disposition instructions  contained in paragraph 3.12.3. 3.12.13.2.  If  it  cannot  be  determined  if  the  item(s)  are  from  a  military  source,  or  safe from a storage and handling aspect, treat item(s) as a Level 2 response and coordinate its disposal with the base environmental function and EOD. (T-1). 3.12.13.2.1.  The installation Commander has the final disposition authority. (T-0). 3.12.13.2.2.  If  the  decision  is  made  to  dispose,  existing  Air  Force  OB/OD  Units should  be  considered  based  on  cost  effectiveness.    Prior  to  selecting  an  existing OB/OD Unit, the following conditions must exist: 3.12.13.2.2.1.  When explosive assets are declared Level-2, the munitions activity shall  initiate  actions  through  the  local  base/installation  environmental  function IAW paragraph 3.12.7. (T-1). 3.12.13.2.2.2.  The receiving installation OB/OD Unit must be EPA permitted to treat  the  type  and  quantity  of  munitions  requiring  disposal  and  to  receive  those waste munitions from off-site sources for disposal. (T-0). 3.12.13.3.  If  a  non-military  munition/explosive  cannot  be  declared  a  Level-2  due  to Federal, State, or local regulations, then the DoD installations and responsible activities shall  request  DDA  disposition  assistance  when  the  non-military  munitions  is  no  longer required to be retained/cannot be retained. (T-1). 3.12.14.  Disposition  of  unserviceable  Foreign  munitions  and  Foreign  Military  Sales (FMS) munitions maintained or generated at Air Force installations. 3.12.14.1.  Foreign  munitions  used  by  foreign  forces  within  the  United  States  are  not DoD military munitions and therefore will be subject to the requirements Title 10, U.S.C. Section 2692. (T-0). 3.12.14.2.  Air Force activities that conduct Joint US and foreign operations (e.g., training or  testing)  with  foreign  forces  or  involving  foreign-owned  munitions  located  in  the United States shall: 3.12.14.2.1.  Ensure foreign-owned munitions are retrograded with redeploying units. (T-0). 3.12.14.2.2.

The  MASO  will  ensure  that  ADR  transactions  in  CAS  are  finalized  after receiving instructions from the Air Force DDA. (T-1). 3.12.16.  Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). 3.12.16.1.  In addition to level 1 and level 2 emergency, and routine EOD responses, Air Force  officials,  including  local  military  commanders,  may  be  directed/required  in Immediate  Response  Authority  (IRA)  situations  to  provide  EOD  support  to  domestic local  civilian  law  enforcement  agencies  IAW  AFI  10-801,  Defense  Support  of  Civil Authorities  (DSCA)  and  DoDI  3025.21,  Defense  Support  of  Civilian  Law  Enforcement Agencies. 3.12.16.2.  Hazardous military explosives items or improvised explosive devices will not be returned to the MSA for storage unless directed by higher authority. (T-1). 3.12.16.3.  Requests  from  civil  authorities  for  non-immediate  EOD  support  (e.g., materials not of DoD origin) will be subject to approval by the Secretary of Defense. (T-0).    Examples  of  non-immediate  DoD  EOD  support  include  use  of  DoD  materials, equipment, and Air Force munitions storage facilities. 3.13.  Management of Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH). 3.13.1.  MPPEH.  Material owned or controlled by the DoD (to include DoD contractors as provided in contracts) that, prior to determination of its explosives safety status, potentially contains  explosives  or  munitions.    MPPEH  typically  includes  munitions  containers  and packaging  material;  debris  remaining  after  munitions  use,  demilitarization,  or  disposal;  and range-related debris.  MPPEH also includes material that potentially contains a high enough concentration  of  explosives  that  the material  presents  an explosive  hazard  (e.g.,  equipment, drainage  systems,  holding  tanks,  piping,  or  ventilation  ducts  that  were  associated  with munitions production, demilitarization, disposal operations). 3.13.2.  Excluded from MPPEH is: the  DoD-established  munitions  management 3.13.2.1.  Munitions  within system.  Munitions  maintained,  stored,  transported,  and  utilized  within  the  operational stockpile  are  not  considered  MPPEH.    This  includes  wholly  inert  munitions  assets  and empty  containers temporarily  retained  for  repacking  assets  in  maintenance  or  in-use  for current operations. 3.13.2.2.  Persons and activities outside the DoD or Air Force. Note:  Defense contractors comply with DoD 4140.62 provisions when included in contracts. 3.13.2.3.  Munitions containers or packaging material that can be positively identified as explosive  free  through  normal  visual  means  are  not  considered  MPPEH.    These   56  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 containers  are  inspected,  certified,  marked,  sealed,  segregated,  and  disposed  of  IAW DoDI 4140.62; DoD 4160.28-M, Vol. 1, 2, and 3; and TO 11A-1-60. 3.13.2.4.  Military  munitions  or  material  transferred  within  or  released  from  DoD control  that  are  used  for  their intended  purposes.  Transfer  or  release  occurs  when  a receiver  has  acknowledged  receipt  of  MDAS  IAW  paragraph  3.13.3.2  or  Material Documented  as  an  Explosive  Hazard  (MDEH) IAW  paragraph  3.13.3.3  by  signing the  DD  Form  1348-1A,  Issue  Release/Receipt  Document,  (or  equivalent  document) and has taken physical custody of the MDAS or MDEH from a DoD activity. 3.13.3.  MPPEH  Inspection  and  Documentation.  Ammunition,  Explosives,  Dangerous Articles  (AEDA),  AEDA  residue,  MPPEH,  range  residue,  and  explosives-contaminated property will be inspected, certified, and documented IAW DoD 4160.21-M, DoD 4160.28-M, Vol. 1, 2, and 3, DoDI 4140.62, and TO 11A-1-60. (T-0).  All generated MPPEH will be inspected and  documented  by  qualified  personnel  to  classify  MPPEH  as  either  MDAS  or Material Documented as an Explosive Hazard (MDEH). (T-0). 3.13.3.1.  Once MPPEH is determined to be either MDAS or MDEH, this material is no longer considered to be MPPEH. 3.13.3.2.  MDAS  is  previously  generated  MPPEH  that  has  been  inspected  and documented  (certified)  as  not  presenting  an  explosive  hazard.    Once  identified  and documented  as  MDAS,  this  material  will  not  be  misidentified  as  either  MPPEH  or MDEH. (T-0). 3.13.3.3.  MDEH is previously generated MPPEH that cannot be documented as MDAS, and  includes  MPPEH  that  has  been  inspected  and  documented  to  present  a  known “specific”  or  suspected  “maximum”  explosive  hazard  potential.  Once  identified  and documented  as  MDEH,  this  material  will  not  be  misidentified  as  either  MPPEH  or MDAS. (T-0).  The  MDEH  classification  only  addresses  the  explosives  safety  status  of material.    EXAMPLE:  If  the  specific  explosive  hazards  of  MDEH  cannot  be  positively determined,  the  material  is  assumed  to  contain  the  “maximum”  potential  explosive hazard. 3.13.3.4.  Documentation  of  MDAS  or  MDEH  will  be  done  only  after  100-percent inspection and a 100-percent independent reinspection; or after processing by a DDESB-approved means with an appropriate post-processing inspection. (T-0). 3.13.3.4.1.  Documentation  of  MDEH  will  include  the  inspection  and  reinspection (processing  and  inspection)  determining  the  explosives  safety  status  (known  or suspected) of the material present. (T-0).  Only one signature is required to document MDEH  when  a  visual  inspection  can  positively  identify  the  known  “specific”  or suspected  “maximum”  explosive  hazard  present;  otherwise  two  signatures  shall  be required. (T-0). 3.13.3.4.2.  Documentation  of  MDAS  will  include  the  inspection  and  reinspection (processing and inspection) with two independent signatures by trained and certified personnel. (T-0). 3.13.3.4.3.  When two signatures are required: 3.13.3.4.3.1.  The first signatory must be technically qualified and will be either a AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   57  DoD employee or a DoD contractor. (T-0).  This signatory will have performed or witnessed  the  initial  100-percent  inspection  or  DDESB-approved  processing  of the material. (T-0). 3.13.3.4.3.2.  The  second  signatory  shall  be  a  technically  qualified  U.S.  citizen who  will  be  either  a  DoD  employee  or  a  DoD  contractor.  (T-0).  This  signatory must  have  performed  or  witnessed  the  independent  100-percent  reinspection  or conducted  an  independent  inspection  of  processed  material  using  an  approved sampling method. (T-0). 3.13.3.4.3.3.  Each  signatory  will  ensure  the  chain  of  custody  was  maintained before signing the explosives safety documentation. (T-0).  If the chain of custody is  found  to  have  been  broken  while  under  DoD  control,  the  explosives  safety status documentation will no longer be valid. (T-0).  The affected material will be considered  MPPEH  and  shall  undergo  either  a  second  100-percent  visual inspection  process  or  reprocessing  using  a  DDESB-approved  methodology  with appropriate post-processing inspection to re-establish the explosives safety status and chain of custody of this material. (T-0). 3.13.3.4.4.  Visual  inspections  may  be  used  when  the  explosives  safety  status  of material and safety can be positively assured. 3.13.3.4.5.  When  visual  inspection  cannot  classify  MPPEH  to  be  MDAS,  the material  will  be  documented  and  managed  as  MDEH;  or  other  DDESB-approved means  (e.g.,  thermal  treatment)  will  be  utilized  to  remove  the  explosive  hazard, inspect, and certify as MDAS before release. (T-0). 3.13.3.4.6.  Statements  required  by  DoDI  4140.62  will  be  used  to  document  the determination of material’s explosives safety status (e.g., MDAS, MDEH). (T-0). 3.13.3.5.  Air Force munitions personnel and qualified munitions inspector’s trained IAW the  provisions  of  paragraph  3.8.4  shall  be  considered  qualified  to  handle,  inspect,  and certify MPPEH. (T-1).  Refer to DoDI 4140.62 for Qualification and Training guidelines. 3.13.3.6.  Consult  with  the  appropriate  Air  Force  DDA  (ASM  –  Robins  AFB; Conventional  Munitions  –  Hill  AFB)  and  the  local  environmental  function  if  a determination cannot be made if the residue is non-hazardous (see paragraph 9.7.5).   3.13.4.  Controlling  MPPEH,  MDAS,  and  MDEH.  MPPEH, MDAS,  and MDEH  will be controlled, managed, and segregated to maintain a continuous chain of custody and prevent its  unauthorized  use,  transfer,  or  release. (T-0).  MPPEH  is  transferred  according  to paragraph  3.13.5.    Refer  to  supply  chain  materiel  management  procedures,  processes,  and policies; and explosive safety standards within Chapter 7 3.13.4.1.  Establish and maintain a chain of custody for all MPPEH, MDAS, and MDEH through its life-cycle until transfer, expenditure, or disposal. (T-0).  Utilize existing CAS and munitions management procedures and processes in  Chapter  7 to maintain a chain of  custody  for  these  assets.  (T-1).  Existing  physical,  transactional,  and  informational processes all contribute to maintaining a chain of custody. 3.13.4.2.  IAW  DoDI  4140.62,  MPPEH  will  be  managed  and  processed  (e.g.,  sorted, vented, inspected, segregated, secured) on the operational range or at the point of use to   58  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 minimize  handling  and  transport  prior  to  processing  and  to  facilitate  disposition.  (T-0).  In certain circumstances, the movement of MPPEH from either the operational range or point  of  use  could  require  its  management  as  WMM  under  applicable  Federal  or  State requirements. 3.13.4.2.1.  Air  Force  units,  organizations,  and  activities  that  generate  range-related debris are responsible for managing security, custody, inspection, and documentation of  MPPEH  and  MDEH  from  collection  through  its  disposition  or  release  from  DoD control as MDAS. (T-0).  Air Force munitions personnel secure, manage, inspect, and document  MPPEH,  MDEH,  or  MDAS  only  when  it  is  returned  to  the  base  or installation MSA for processing. (T-1). 3.13.4.2.2.  Operational  units  and  ranges  will  minimize  the  physical  transfer  of explosive residue or munitions constituents from MPPEH during the management and disposition process. (T-1). 3.13.4.3.  Generating  activities  collect  MPPEH,  MDAS,  and  MDEH  (e.g.,  scrap,  waste, and  residue)  and  will  identify  assets,  segregate  the  materiel,  and  determine  the  point  at which  no  further  material  will  be  added  to  prevent  comingling.  (T-0).    Generated MPPEH,  MDAS,  and  MDEH  explosive,  incendiary,  and  chemical  ammunition  is dangerous and will never be commingled with other types of property. (T-0). 3.13.4.4.  Containers  and  holding  areas  to  process,  manage,  segregate,  and  control MPPEH,  MDAS,  and  MDEH  will  be  located  in  secure  areas  and  are  included  in  local facility  threat  assessments,  by  Resource  Protection  personnel,  when  conducted. (T-1).  These containers and holding areas will be secured and marked as to clearly identify: 3.13.4.4.1.  The hazards or potential hazards (if any) that are present. (T-0). 3.13.4.4.2.  The explosives safety  status  of the material  present. (T-0).  This  consists of  documentation  of  the  processing  and  inspection  of  MDAS  supported  with  two independent signatures by trained and certified personnel IAW paragraph 3.13.3. 3.13.4.5.  Air  Force  units  and  organizations  contact  DLA  Disposition  Services  for guidance on availability of containers for use at the source, by scrap generators. 3.13.5.  Transfer  or Release  of MPPEH.  Air Force munitions personnel will only transfer or release MPPEH and MDEH to those DoD components, activities, and personnel that meet the  requirements  for  certification,  licensing  and  permits,  transportation,  training,  and experience outlined in DoDI 4140.62. (T-0). 3.13.5.1.  Air  Force  personnel  will  not  release  MPPEH  to  non-DoD  entities  for possession, management, or processing. (T-0). 3.13.5.2.  Contracts or other legal agreements to transfer or release MPPEH to non-DoD entities  are  the  responsibility  of  the  generating  activity. (T-1).  Air  Force  munitions activities and personnel do not generate MPPEH and therefore shall not establish or fund contracts for release of MPPEH to non-DoD entities. (T-1). 3.13.5.3.  Explosive  hazards  must  be  identified  and  documented  prior  to  the  transfer  of any  MPPEH,  MDEH,  or  MDAS  within  the  DoD;  transfer  of  MDEH  to  a  qualified receiver; or release of MDAS to non-DoD activities or the public. (T-0). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   59  3.13.5.4.  A legible copy of the explosives safety status documentation shall accompany documented  material  upon  its  transfer  from  DoD  control.  (T-0).    DoD  Components generating MPPEH will maintain copies of explosives safety status documentation for 3 years after release from DoD control. (T-0). 3.13.5.5.  Transfer or release occurs when a receiver has acknowledged receipt of MDAS IAW paragraph 3.13.3.2 or MDEH IAW paragraph 3.13.3.3 by signing the DD Form 1348-1A,  Issue  Release/Receipt  Document,  (or  equivalent  document)  and  has  taken physical custody of the MDAS or MDEH from a DoD activity. 3.13.6.  Munitions and MPPEH Demilitarization/Disposal Documentation Procedures. 3.13.6.1.  All  ADR  munitions  assets  authorized  for  demilitarization  or  disposal  will  be processed using program Create ADR Shipment (AMI28A). (T-1). 3.13.6.1.1.  When the demilitarization or disposal activity is not on the same base as the munitions account processing the A5J input, the DoDAAC of the base where the demilitarization  or  disposal  activity  is  located  shall  be  entered  as  the  “Ship  to” address. (T-1). 3.13.6.1.1.1.  Inert,  empty,  or  non-explosive  munitions  and  components  will  be demilitarize  according  to  their  DEMIL  Code. (T-0).  When  munitions  flight personnel  conduct  the  demilitarization,  the  base  DLA  Disposition  Services DoDAAC will be the “Ship to” address. (T-1). 3.13.6.1.1.2.  MDAS which has not been demilitarized or processed as scrap shall be  shipped  to  central  disposal  activities  per  paragraph  7.13. (T-1).  These shipments  will  be  processed  using  the  ‘Shipment  For  Disposal’  selection  within Create ADR Shipment (AMI28A). (T-1). 3.13.6.1.1.3.  Demilitarized or scrap MDAS not shipped through local deployment and  distribution  flight  (e.g.,  turned  over  to  base  scrap  vendors,  recycling activity/points) will be shipped using the ‘Shipment For DRMO’ selection within Create ADR Shipment (AMI28A). (T-1).  The MASO will print name and sign in block  22  and  date  block  23  to  “receipt”  for  assets  on  the  A5J  when  these  assets are delivered to a base scrap vendor or recycling activity/point. (T-1). 3.13.6.1.2.  Explosives  or  classified  assets  will  be  demilitarized  as  directed  by  DoD 4160.21-M  and  DoD  4160.28-M,  Vol.  1,  2,  and  3.  (T-0).  Non-explosive  and  non-classified assets will be demilitarized per their assigned DEMIL code. (T-0).  Refer to the  asset  IDR  or  Web  Federal  Logistics  Information  System  (WebFLIS)  for demilitarization code, CIIC, and definitions. 3.13.7.  Temporary Property Accountability. 3.13.7.1.  DLA  Disposition  Services:    Munitions  authorized  for  demilitarization  or disposal  according  to  the  ADR  will  be  scheduled  for  demilitarization  or  disposal  on  a certain date. (T-1). 3.13.7.2.  Disposal  documents  will  be  produced  no  earlier  than  5  duty  days  before  the scheduled demilitarization or disposal date. (T-1).   60  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 3.13.7.3.

THERE  IS  RESIDUAL  MATERIEL  WHICH  HAS  BEEN DOWNGRADED TO SCRAP."  (T-0).  The stock number shall be circled and the word SCRAP  entered. (T-1).  The  scrap  materiel  and  the  documents  will  be  returned  to  DLA Disposition Services for processing. (T-1). and  witnessing  officials  must 3.13.8.2.  EOD.    For  complete  destruction  of  items  or  emergency  disposal  actions,  the disposal "DISPOSAL  HAS  BEEN ACCOMPLISHED.    THERE  IS  NO  RESIDUAL  MATERIEL  WHICH  HAS  BEEN DOWNGRADED  TO  WASTE."  (T-0).  This  statement  will  be  annotated  on  the consumption issue document and signed by the disposal and witnessing officials. (T-1). certify 3.14.  Captured Enemy Ammunition (CEA). 3.14.1.  CEA  Reporting.  Report  CEA  when  found  or located  to  the  NAF/higher headquarters  as  soon  as  possible.  (T-2).  Reports  should  include  types,  quantity,  date,  time, location, and circumstance of discovery/capture and request disposition instructions. (T-2). 3.14.2.  CEA  Safety.  CEA  shall  be  treated  in  the  same  manner  as  Unexploded  Explosive Ordnance  (UXO).  (T-1).  CEA  will  not  be  handled  until  declared  safe  by  EOD.  (T-1).  If possible,  from  a  safe  distance  identify  and  record  pertinent  facts  such  as  the  date,  time, location  (map  reference),  type  (e.g.,  bomb,  artillery  shell,  rocket),  quantity,  size,  obvious markings, and other relevant information (e.g., S/N, nation of origin). 3.14.3.  CEA  Acceptance  and  Property  Responsibility.  Only  competent  command authorities  (Joint  Captured  Materiel  Exploitation  Center  (JCMEC),  Combined  Captured Materiel  Exploitation  Center  (CCMEC),  Joint  Forces  Commander,  Joint  Task  Force Commander, etc.) will make determinations on whether CEA shall be disposed of in-place, identified and rendered safe for relocation, or retained for its inherent intelligence value. (T-1).    Munitions  personnel  are  not  authorized  to  make  these  decisions  and  shall  elevate  any CEA issues through command channels. (T-1).  Munitions personnel will not take possession of, handle, or transport any CEA designated for emergency or routine disposal until declared safe by EOD. (T-0). 3.14.3.1.  After  competent  authorities  identify  and  direct  CEA  to  be  retained  for intelligence  or  other  purpose,  units  may  be  directed  to  assist  EOD  personnel  in  render safe,  handling,  and  relocation  operations.    Once  certified  safe  by  EOD  personnel,  CEA becomes the property of the United States Government and the responsibility of the DoD. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   61  3.14.3.2.  Technically  qualified  personnel  from  other  military  services,  coalition  forces, or  government  agencies  will  usually  take  charge  of  CEA.    When  these  activities  take possession  of  CEA,  responsibility  of  Air  Force  munitions  personnel  or  the  MASO  to manage and dispose of CEA is relinquished. 3.14.3.3.  Air Force munitions personnel will only accept CEA when specifically directed by  the  Joint  Captured  Materiel  Exploitation  Center  (JCMEC)/Combined  Captured Materiel Exploitation Center (CCMEC). (T-0).  CCMEC may be established for coalition operations. 3.14.4.  Accounting  for  CEA.  Only  account  for  CEA  in  CAS  when  there  is  an  official validated Air Force requirement stated in a document, memo, or other written form, directing CEA  be  maintained  and  issued  to  Air  Force  or  other  government  agency  personnel  in  the performance of their official duties. (T-1).  When a valid Air Force CEA requirement exists, manage CEA in CAS as follows: 3.14.4.1.

This chapter provides munitions management procedures at the tactical level (installation/base).  It describes the requirements and processes to manage  munitions  accountability  and  complete  CAS  transactions  as  depicted  in  Figure  7.1, Munitions Operational Flow Process (Peacetime and Wartime).  These processes focus on near-real time CAS transaction processing using automated-, direct-, or remote-input methods on the flightline and in the munitions area during peacetime and wartime.  Near-real time asset visibility is  an  Air  Force  requirement  at  all  levels.    To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  utilize  available technologies to process transactions within 1-hour. (T-3). 7.1.1.  The  Munitions  Operational  Flow  Process.  All munitions activities and units use a single munitions operational flow process in peacetime and in wartime, at home-station and at deployed locations, to effectively support aircraft SGO and other missions.  All munitions transactions  are  processed  within  CAS.  (T-1).    Munitions  supervisors  and  managers  must integrate  these  processes  into  their  section,  element,  and  crew  procedures,  operating instructions, and training plans to ensure personnel are knowledgeable of these processes. (T-2).    Major  process  phases  include:    Planning,  Execution,  and  Transaction  as  depicted  in Figure  7.1.    Each  phase  includes  processes  that  occur  continuously,  overlap,  and  are  not bound  by  geography  or  mission.    The  sequence  or  workcenter  alignment  of  processes  may differ locally.  However, each step is essential to enable effective decision-making, assure a high  level  of  accountability,  near-real  time  CAS  transaction  processing  accuracy,  and  total asset visibility. 7.1.1.1.  Planning Phase.  Refer to Figure 7.1. 7.1.1.1.1.  Receive  Demand/Requests:    Munitions  requests  for  external  support  are received from supported organizations and agencies.  Munitions requests for internal munitions  activity  are  derived  through  the  munitions  scheduling  process,  such  as receipt,  shipping,  maintenance,  inspection,  or  warehousing  tasks.    Integrate  external and internal schedules to effectively meet all workload requirements. (T-1). 7.1.1.1.1.1.  Requests to support SGO are normally received in the form of an Air Tasking  Order  (ATO),  flying  schedule,  special  instructions  (SPINS);  AF  2407, Weekly/Daily tasking documentation.  When  received,  the  controlling  activity,  generally  Munitions Control will evaluate and prioritize requests. (T-1). Coordination, other Flying Schedule or 7.1.1.1.1.2.  Requests  to  support  custody  accounts  and  other  non-flying  unit customers  are  received  by  Munitions  Operations  or  Munitions  Control  from  the account  custodian  or  unit through  electronic  or  other communications.    These  requests  are  processed in  CAS  by  munitions  personnel, added  to  the  munitions  schedule  as  scheduled  or  unscheduled  tasks,  and accomplished to meet the customer demand. (T-1). representative 7.1.1.1.1.3.  Requests for home station or deployed munitions support (e.g., SGO, custody  account,  other  non-flying  units),  should  not  be  delayed  by  unnecessary scheduling  or  management  controls  that  do  not  contribute  to  effective  and   92  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 efficient  accountability.  Focus  processes  on  meeting  customer  demands  as quickly and efficiently as possible. 7.1.1.1.2.  Validate  Allocation  (Peacetime  Only):    During  peacetime  operations, ensure munitions are not expended without an approved allocation. (T-1).  Remaining allocations are validated by Munitions Control or other controlling function using the Asset  Level  Inquiry  (AMQ07A).  (T-3).    All  munitions  functions  that  direct,  handle, process,  deliver,  and  support  flightline  munitions  have  responsibilities  to  prevent exceeding approved allocations.  In wartime, munitions requests are only constrained by asset availability and safety factors. 7.1.1.1.3.  Determine  Asset  Availability:    After  validating  allocations,  determine availability of assets.  Review various CAS programs for pre-built assets that satisfy requests using Complete Round Inquiry (AM522A), Complete Round Asset Summary (AM523A),  etc.    Determine  component  availability  to  satisfy  any  remaining quantities  using  Complete  Round  Analyzer  (AMR01A),  Complete  Round  Build-up (AMJ01A), etc. 7.1.1.1.4.  Component/Lot Selection:  Select and utilize available pre-built assets.  If additional  assets  are  needed  select  components  by  lot,  or  requisition  assets,  if authorized. 7.1.1.2.  Execution Phase.  Refer to Figure 7.1. 7.1.1.2.1.  Movement  to  Build/Processing  Locations:    Break-out  selected  assets, deliver  to  build-up/processing  sites,  and  update  locations  using  CAS  Movement Process (AM104A). (T-1). 7.1.1.2.1.1.  Once  moved  to  the  build-up/processing  site,  manage  locations  IAW Movement Control OI. (T-3). 7.1.1.2.1.2.  Notify  Munitions  Control  of  any  fire  and  hazard  symbols  and  CIIC changes. (T-0). 7.1.1.2.2.  Inspect Assets and Process Condition Code Changes:  Perform appropriate inspections  IAW  TO  11A-1-10  and  TO  11A-1-63  and  any  required  preparatory  or maintenance actions. (T-0).  Process any required CC changes in CAS. (T-0). 7.1.1.2.3.  Identify  CR  Batch  Quantity,  Process  WSN  Build,  and  Build/Assemble:  After inspections, preparatory actions, and CC updates are completed, begin the CAS CR build-up process. (T-1). 7.1.1.2.3.1.  Properly identify all components used to build CRs.  (T-1).  A WSN is  a  14-digit  code  identifying  the  CRWC,  DoDAAC,  and  batch  number.    CAS assigns a separate WSN for each build of a particular CRWC. 7.1.1.2.3.2.  Assembling a CR in CAS may be done either before, during, or after assembly of physical assets.  However, to prevent mixing WSN component lots it is recommended that the CR assembly be processed in CAS prior to beginning the physical build-up/assembly.  It is essential that a new WSN be generated any time a component lot is depleted or changes during a CR build. (T-1). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   93  7.1.1.2.3.2.1.  When  a  CAS  generated  WSN  is  assigned,  each  CR  will  be properly  marked  with  an  abbreviated  WSN  IAW  Attachment  1.  (T-1).  Unless prohibited by the item TO the CR will be conspicuously marked.  (T-1).    Marking  of  abbreviated  WSN  on  chaff/flare  magazine,  2.75"  rockets, BDU-33 practice bombs, and 105MM rounds is not required. 7.1.1.2.3.2.2.  If  CAS  or  AIT  is  not  immediately  available,  document  all  CR build-up, assembly, or processing actions on an AF IMT 4331 and process CR actions  in  CAS  within  one-hour.  (T-3).    Assign  and  annotate  a  “T” (Temporary)  designator  on  each  CR  between  the  CRWC  and  batch  number signifying  it  a  Temporary  WSN  (BL2CM-TXXX).  (T-2).    When  CAS becomes  available  either  remark  the  CR  with  the  CAS  assigned  permanent WSN, or retain the temporary WSN on each CR provided that a WSN cross-reference list is maintained. (T-2). 7.1.1.2.3.2.3.  Additional  local  CR  suffix  markings  may  be  used  with  the abbreviated  WSN  to  identify  munitions  configurations. EXAMPLE:    A  CR wired for Triple Ejection Racks (TER) or parent-mount racks and/or (X or +) fin configuration; a CR marked with (BC21H-35T+) might identify a conical MK-82 wired for a TER “T” with the fin in the + configuration.   94  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 Figure 7.1.  Munitions Operations Flow Plan (Peacetime and Wartime).  7.1.1.2.4.  Move to Holding Area, Load Aircraft, Release Assets to Customer:  After CR munitions are assembled (if applicable), all assets (e.g., CR, AUR, components) are typically moved to holding areas awaiting custodian pick-up, to trailers and then holding  areas  for  future  delivery,  to  storage  locations,  or  directly  to  aircraft  parking locations  for  aircraft  loading.    These  locations  are  normally  loaded  in  CAS  as facilities  or  containers  allowing  the  use  of  CAS  Movement  Process  (AM104A)  to process these movement transactions in CAS. 7.1.1.2.4.1.  CR  Movements:  For  CRs,  use  an  abbreviated  WSN  showing  the CRWC  and  the  last  three  digits  of  the  WSN  as  part  of  the  CAS  location.  EXAMPLE:    BL2CM-XXX.  (T-2).  Units  may  use  remaining  “location”  field characters IAW their Movement Control OI. Note: CAS provides the default location for CnC moves. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   95  7.1.1.2.4.2.  Validating  Munitions  Movements.    Munitions  managers,  sections, and  work  centers  must  use  the  Storage  Location  Report  (AM567A)  to  assist  in reconciling assets in operating locations. (T-1). 7.1.1.2.4.3.  Release  Assets  to  Requestor/Customer:    External  non-flying  unit customers pick-up assets from the MSA. (T-3).  Validate customer authority and credentials  to  receive/accept  munitions  and  obtain  digital  or  hard  copy signature acceptance for all munitions assets released. (T-0). 7.1.1.2.5.  Pre-transaction  Data  Validation:  Before  processing  any  CAS  receipt, shipment,  or  expenditure  transaction,  task  data  supporting  a  transaction  must  be validated at the “point-of-use” to ensure 100-percent accuracy. (T-1).  This validation is  a  step  in  the  “Execution”  phase  and  is  essential  to  support  SGO  or  customer support processes.  EXAMPLE:  An individual processing a CAS transaction queries CAS  to  determine  the  correct  assets  loaded  on  an  aircraft  prior  to  processing  the expenditure. 7.1.1.2.5.1.  Receipts  and  Shipments:  Validate  all  information  and  data  on receipt/shipping  documents  matches physical assets  or  exterior markings exactly before  processing  receipt  and  shipment  transactions.  (T-1).  Process  these transactions  in  CAS  IAW  paragraph  7.9  and  paragraph  7.13  as  they  occur throughout the day. (T-0). 7.1.1.2.5.2.  Flightline  Movements  and  Expenditures:  Validate  flightline  task activity  before  processing  movement  or  expenditure (T-1).  Documentation of munitions/weapons activity on an AF IMT 4331 by munitions personnel and the AF IMT 2434 by the weapons expediter indicate this validation has been completed.  See paragraph  7.11.2.3.5 for aircraft gun ammunition and countermeasure expenditures. in  CAS. 7.1.1.2.6.  Download,  Recover,  or  Refrag  Assets:    If  assets  are  not  shipped  or expended,  then  download,  recover  to  the  munitions  area,  or  refrag  the  assets  to another mission.  This generally involves a location movement using CAS Movement Process (AM104A). 7.1.1.3.  Transaction Phase:  Refer to Figure 7.1. 7.1.1.3.1.  Processing  CAS  Transactions:    This  phase  culminates  all  previous  steps within the Munitions Operations Flow Process and results in properly processed CAS transactions.    Processing  transactions  in  CAS  changes  the  asset  posture,  stockpile balance, location, or asset condition.  These changes are visible to stockpile managers at  all  levels  and    may  impact  logistics  support  decisions.    Timeliness  of  CAS processing  should  not  overshadow  the  importance  of  accuracy.    CAS  transactions may be processed by any person performing the munitions/weapons task (technician, inspector, bay-chief, supervisor, crew chief, weapons expediter, etc.) or personnel in a centralized  control  activity  (Munitions  Control,  storage  dispatch,  etc.).    Personnel processing  CAS  transactions  must  have  a  valid  CAC  card,  an  Air  Force  Portal account,  authorized  CAS  access  by  the  MASO,  and  are  assigned  to  perform  these activities  by  munitions/weapons  supervision.    CAS  transactions  are  processed  using automated-, direct-, or remote-input methods as follows:   96  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 Note: Automated- or direct-input methods currently do not support proper processing/recording of munitions inventories.  Use remote input with CAS generated, manual, or digital count sheets IAW Attachment 3, Inventory Procedures.  7.1.1.3.1.1.  Automated-Input:  Process  automated-input  transactions  IAW  this guidance,  paragraph  7.1.2  and  paragraph  7.1.3,  and  published  AIT  equipment manuals or guidance. (T-1).  Automated-input is the preferred CAS input method (except  for  inventories),  and  is  the  only  “point-of-use”  processing  method.  Munitions  and  weapons  personnel  maximize  the  use  of  AIT  automated-input  at units  and  installations  where  AIT  capabilities  have  been  bed-down.  (T-1).  Automated-input includes AIT capabilities, Commercial Mobile Devices (CMD), Radio  Frequency  Identification  (RFID),  and  other  machine  devices  enabled  by secure Common Access Card (CAC) authentication and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)  capabilities.    Automated  capabilities  are  functional  at  any  location  the Internet is accessible by signing onto the web-enabled CAS system.  Transactions may  be  saved  in  the  hardware  memory  to  be  uploaded  into  CAS  later  (batch mode)  or  transmitted  immediately  through  hard-wired  or  Air  Force  approved wireless  technology  to  a  base  LAN  or  Wide  Area  Network  (WAN).    Munitions and Weapons managers must be aware of AIT capabilities and personnel training to obtain the full benefits of AIT automated “point of use” CAS processing and to determine the input method that best meets mission requirements. 7.1.1.3.1.2.  Direct-Input:    Process  transactions  directly  into  CAS  through  key punch using docked, undocked, or wireless enabled computers or laptops from or near  work  locations.  Munitions  and  weapons  personnel  will  use  direct-input (except  for  inventories)  when  automated-input  methods  are  not  available  or cannot be employed effectively to streamline operational processes. (T-1).  When using  direct-input  methods,  processes  should  not  be  inhibited  by  excessive management controls.  Munitions and Weapons managers should place emphasis on validation of the data captured at all steps in the operational process to ensure data is processed accurately and timely into CAS at periodic intervals. 7.1.1.3.1.3.  Remote-Input:  Process  CAS  transactions  using  remote-input  when automated-input  and  direct-input  methods  are  not  available  or  cannot  be employed effectively to streamline operational processes.  Remote-input involves passing CAS transactional data/information (e.g., expenditures. movements) using secure  and  unsecure  Land  Mobile  Radios  (LMR),  telecommunications;    or  by using runners to deliver completed forms and documents to Munitions Control, or other  processing locations, where  CAS transaction are processed.  Units will use remote-input  to  record  and  process  munitions  inventories. (T-1).  When  using remote-input,  all  munitions  and  weapons  loading  activity  will  be  documented manually. (T-1).  Munitions activity will be documented on the AF IMT 4331 and weapons  loading  and  expenditure  activity  will  be  documented  on  the  AF  IMT 2434 IAW AFI 21-101. (T-1).  If CAS is available, once activity is completed and documented, information may be “remotely” called to Munitions Control or other controlling  activity  via  radio/telephone  for  immediate  CAS  processing.    Then, physically deliver the AF IMT 4331 or AF IMT 2434 to a designated location to validate  the  previously  processed  CAS  transactions.  If  CAS  is  not  available, AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   97  document activity and physically deliver the information to a designated location for  future  CAS  processing.  This  documentation  will  be  retained  until  the  100-percent movement validation is completed IAW paragraph 5.2.4.1. (T-1). 7.1.1.3.2.  Validate CAS Flightline Data Entry:  This validation provides the MASO and munitions  managers with  confidence that CAS transaction history  for Flightline activity  is  accurate.    The  Transaction  History  Report  (AM903A)  must  be  compared against the AF IMT 2434 or other supporting documents.  (T-1).  Discrepancies will be researched and corrected. (T-0). 7.1.1.3.3.  Document  Control  and  Management:    Routing,  control,  and  management of  documents  represent  the  final  steps  in  the  Munitions  Operational  Flow  Process.  Elimination  and  reduction  of  paper  documents  within  this  process  remains  an important goal.  However, certain accountable, auditable, or other documents key to management  review  and  validation  must  be  routed  to  appropriate  activities.  Procedures  to  manage  documents  including  routing,  flow,  control,  and  filing  are provided  in  Attachment  5.    Additionally,  the  following  documentation  guidelines apply: 7.1.1.3.3.1.  Munitions  Process  Documentation:    Munitions/weapons  managers and  the  MASO  direct  documentation  when  required  by  policy;  when  in  their judgment,  it  is  necessary  to  maintain  an  auditable  document  trail;  or  to  validate data  accuracy  of  CAS required documentation, munitions/weapons managers must decide what level and amount of data recording is necessary to validate munitions activity and CAS transactions.  Managers  should  avoid  excessive  management  controls  and  documentation  that delays or hinders customer support /mission execution. transaction  processing.  In  addition to 7.1.1.3.3.2.  The AF IMT 4331:  This is a multi-purpose form designed to record all  types  of  munitions  transaction/data  for  accountable,  auditable,  and  non-accountable munitions activity during peacetime and wartime.  This form is also a management tool that facilitates the validation of CAS transaction processing. 7.1.1.3.3.2.1.  Completing the AF IMT 4331:  The first six blocks of this form are administrative in nature and determine what process the form will be used to  record.    The  remaining  blocks  are  used  to  capture  individual  transaction data related to that process.  Each line is capable of recording all the necessary information  to  process  a  single  transaction  in  CAS  and  is  self-explanatory.  This  form  may  also  be  used  to  record  movement  of  custody  account  assets stored  within  the  MSA,  initial  transfer  of  assets  to  custodians,  or  receipts  of assets from custodians. 7.1.1.3.3.2.2.  Modification of the AF IMT 4331:  MAJCOMS may authorize local modification to the AF IMT 4331 as long as the original data elements are included. 7.1.1.3.3.3.  The  AF  IMT  2434,  Munitions  Configuration  and  Expenditure Document:  This form is used to record weapons/munitions loaded and expended from  aircraft.  Document  weapons/munitions  activity  and  route  the  form  IAW AFI 21-101. (T-1).   98  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 7.1.2.  Internet Access.  CAS is a web-based system that is dependent on connectivity to the Internet;  it  is  not  optional.    Timely  and  accurate  munitions  up-channel  reporting  and subsequent  resupply  efforts  depend  on  this  connectivity.    Ensure  CAS  has  continuous Internet  connectivity  to  support  the  Air  Force  mission.  (T-0).    Where  approved  and  when available, use of commercial wireless technology to speed data input is authorized. (T-2). 7.1.3.  CAS Automated Identification Technology (AIT) Enablement and Use.  CAS AIT allows  technicians,  weapons  expediters,  and  supervisors  use  hardware  and  software applications  to  transmit  transaction  data  automatically  into  CAS.    AIT  data  capture  and transaction  processing  occurs  before,  during,  and  after  munitions/weapons  processes.  Transaction  data  may  be  saved  in  hardware  memory  for  future  upload  into  CAS  or transmitted  immediately  through  hard-wired  or  Air  Force  approved  wireless  devices  via  a base  LAN  or  WAN.    In  addition  to  technical  and  procedural  guidance  for  the  use  of  AIT equipment located on the Air Force Conventional Munitions A2I site, use the following CAS AIT guidance: 7.1.3.1.  Processing  Munitions  Movements  and  Expenditures:  Except  where  stated otherwise,  process  transactions  in  CAS  as  actions  occur  throughout  the  day  using  AIT equipment such as CMD scanners. (T-2).  If AIT capability is not available or functional, maximize  the  use  of  direct-input  IAW  paragraph  7.1.1.3.1.2.  (T-2).    If  direct-input capability  is  not  available  or  functional,  then  utilize  remote-input  IAW  paragraph 7.1.1.3.1.3. (T-2). 7.1.3.2.  Batch Mode Processing:  If automated capability is available and functional, but wireless  connectivity  is  unavailable,  CMD  scanners  will  operate  in  “Batch  Mode”.    In this  mode,  transactions  are  recorded,  captured,  and  remain  “unprocessed”  in  the  CMD scanner  memory  until  connectivity  is  restored  through  wireless  connectivity  or  by docking the CMD scanner. 7.1.3.2.1.  Once connectivity is obtained (wireless or docked) all “unprocessed” batch mode  transactions  are  downloaded  from  the  CMD  and  uploaded  into  CAS  AIT Conflict Resolution (AMP09A) program. 7.1.3.2.2.  Units with enabled AIT capabilities shall develop processes to process off-line (batch mode) transactions at intervals sufficient to support the mission. (T-2). 7.1.3.3.  AIT  Conflict  Resolution  (AMP09A):    The  CAS  AMP09A  program  processes CAS  transactions  downloaded  from  CMDs  in  the  chronological  sequence  that  they actually occurred to avoid transaction “conflicts” within CAS.  Transactions captured in CMD  memory  during  offline  operations  are  not  automatically  processed  when downloaded  to  CAS  after  connectivity  is  restored.  Downloaded  CAS  transactions  must be synchronized in the chronological order based on the transaction date/time stamp, and prior to aircraft recovery. 7.1.3.3.1.  To  support  accurate  AIT  data  capture  in  an  off-line  environment,  an  AIT transaction captured and downloaded by one CMD scanner may not process in CAS because  the  transaction  is  dependent  upon  the  download  and  processing  of  a transaction  from  another  CMD  scanner.    EXAMPLE:    In  an  off-line  mode,  Crew  1 moves a loaded trailer from an operating location (OL1) to a holding pad (HP1) and then  crew  2  moves  the  trailer  from  (HP1)  to  a  flightline  location  (S1).    If  crew  2 AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   99  downloads  the  trailer  movement  transaction  from  HP1  to  S1,  CAS  would  create  an error, since CAS would still show the trailer in OL1.  CAS does not process the crew 2  transaction  until  crew  1  downloads  and  processes  the  first  movement  transaction (OL1 to HP1). 7.1.3.3.2.  Units  using  AIT  must  monitor  the  AIT  Conflict  Resolution  (AMP09A) program  on  a  daily  basis  to  ensure  outstanding  transactions  are  being  cleared  and processed in CAS. (T-2). 7.1.3.4.  AIT  Barcode  Labels:    To  automate  the  data  entry  process,  CAS  provides  the capability to print two-dimensional AIT barcode labels.  Barcode data identifiers tell the CMD scanner what type of data is being read and where it should be placed on the CMD screen.  The following types of labels can be printed using a standard desktop printer or a hip printer attached to the CMD: 7.1.3.4.1.  Warehouse  Label:    The  warehouse  label  contains  the  structure  and location,  and  when  scanned  displays  the  contents  of  that  location.    Place  the warehouse label on corner markers to identify a specific structure location. (T-1).  If corner  markers  cannot  be  utilized,  affix  labels  to  walls,  clipboards,  signs,  or  other means to clearly display labels to meet operational needs. (T-1). 7.1.3.4.2.  Container Label:  The container label contains the container ID and IUID, and when scanned displays the container and any assets within the container.  Place the container label near the field number or at a location that best facilitates visibility and ease of use. (T-1). 7.1.3.4.3.  WSN  Label:    The  WSN  label  contains  a  WSN,  and  when  scanned  will select that  specific WSN.    Place  the  WSN  label  on the  munitions  item  in  a  location that best facilitates visibility when installed on an aircraft (e.g., fin or airfoil group for bombs and near the missile S/N). (T-1). 7.1.3.4.4.  Asset Label:  If used, asset labels contain the mandatory data elements for marking  munitions,  and  are  applied  IAW  MIL-STD-129.  All  available  asset information is pre-populated based on the indicative data record and user input.  All data elements are editable and users take care to validate data is accurate.  The asset label  can  be  generated  for  all  levels  of  packaging.    The  label  contains  a  unique traceability code to prevent duplicate scanning. 7.1.3.4.5.  United  Nations  (UN)  and  Performance  Oriented  Packaging  (POP) markings are not included in the asset label.  These marking are added by users. 7.1.3.4.6.  Consolidated Asset Label.  The consolidated asset label provides the same capability  as  the  Asset  Label  except  it  allows  multiple  NSNs  to  be  added  to  the label.  This label is applied IAW MIL-STD-129. 7.1.3.5.  AIT  Equipment.    AFI  91-208,  Hazards  of  Electromagnetic  Radiation  to Ordnance  (HERO)  Certification  and  Management,  requires  evaluation  and  approval  of AIT  equipment  for  use  around  explosives.    The  HERO  approval  process  identifies standoff distances from munitions items for specific equipment.   100  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 7.1.3.5.1.  Units  will  coordinate  with  ACC/A4WC  prior  to  purchasing  any  AIT equipment for use around munitions to ensure the HERO requirements are being met. (T-0). 7.1.3.5.2.  The  list  of  HERO  approved  and  authorized  devices  is  posted  on  the  Air Force  Conventional  Munitions  A2I  SharePoint®  site.    Units  shall  also  coordinate purchase of any AIT equipment with the local Communications activity. (T-0). 7.1.4.  Structure Management.  All munitions facilities, revetments/pads, Hardened Aircraft Structures (HAS)/PAS, aircraft parking spots, and holding areas for munitions, will be loaded as  individual  CAS  structures.  (T-2).    This  process  allows  assets  to  be  moved  between structures using the normal CAS Movement Process (AM104A) and enables the use of CAS management products to track assembled assets in their physical location  using the Storage Location Report (AM567A).  In addition, a structure titled “Off-Station” may be created for assets currently “off station” and planned to be receipted at a Forward Operating Location or due to return to the base. 7.1.5.  Container-in-Container  (CnC)  Management.  CnC  capability  provides  a  parent-child relationship that enables the movement of a container and its contents in a single move, where  the  NEW,  compatibility  and  CIIC  of  the  contents  are  applied  to  the  container’s location within a structure. Note:  Units  may  manage ready-use/operationally  configured  gun  ammunition  and countermeasures  following  CnC  procedures  or  use  locally  developed  procedures  included  in  a Movement Control OI. 7.1.5.1.  Containers  are  categorized  by  “type”  and  “sub-type”  to  improve  overall container management.  Templates and naming conventions for container types and sub-types are pre-defined in CAS to standardize these across the Air Force.  If container types or sub-types do not support requirements, contact your MAJCOM. EXAMPLE:  Container Type and Container Sub-Types: Aircraft:  B-1B, F-15C, F-16B30, etc. Trailer:  MHU-110, MHU-196, 40ft, etc. ISO:  20ft side opener; 20ft end opener, etc. SUU:  SUU-25 SDB:  BRU-61 MAGS:  Chaff/Flare, Chaff, Flare AGM-88:  CNU-355 7.1.5.2.  Once  loaded,  a  container  ID  carries  a  maintenance  detail  record.    While  not mandatory to update, they enable additional capabilities.  The maintenance detail record varies  based  on  container  type.    Aircraft  detail records  have  information  on  the  owning organization and allow the ORG/SHP code and munitions CAT Codes to be specified for all expenditures processed against the given container ID.  An ISO detail record is used to AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   101  update  container  information  necessary  to  ship  a  loaded  or  empty  container.    All  detail records  provide  the  capability  to  check  the  contents  being  moved  into  it  against  a specified Complete Round Weapons Code (CRWC) or codes. 7.1.5.3.  Container IDs may be added or deleted from the system as needed by the using organization.  Container IDs and items in the context of CnC are not accountable assets in CAS. 7.1.5.3.1.  An  accountable  container  may  be  assigned  a  container  ID  for  ease  of tracking,  however  it  is  the  stock  level  of  this  NSN  that  is  accountable,  not  the  CnC container ID. 7.1.5.3.2.  Once the container ID is assigned, the accountable NSN is moved into the container ID, pairing the two together to make it easier to track and utilize. 7.1.5.4.  Individual  Container  Identification.    A  unique  10-digit  identifier  must  be assigned to each container managed in CAS and cannot be duplicated, regardless of type or sub-type.  Each unit will load individual containers by appropriate container type and sub-type  using  Container  Maintenance  (AM106A).  (T-1).  Container  ID  naming conventions are standardized across the Air Force enterprise as follows: Note:  The  Container  ID  Naming  Convention  reference  list  can  be  found  on  the  Air  Force Conventional Munitions SharePoint® site. Note:  If a “duplication” error is received in CAS contact the CAS Help Desk or submit a CAS Trouble Ticket. 7.1.5.4.1.  Aircraft:    Load  the  two-digit  aircraft  wing  designator  “tail  flash”  as position 1 and 2 (i.e., Langley = FF), the two-digit year of manufacture as position 3 and  4  (i.e., 1989  =  89),  and  a  6-digit  aircraft  tail  number  as  position  5  thru  10  (i.e., FF89123456).  (T-2).  Units are  not  required  to  update aircraft  container locations  in CAS. Note:  Units without assigned aircraft will use a two-digit Command Code of parent MAJCOM as the tail flash designator as follows: (T-2) 7.1.5.4.2.  Trailers:    Load  the  two-position  wing  designator  as  position  1  and  2,  the three-digit trailer type as position 3 thru 5, and the five-digit assigned S/N as position 6 thru 10 (e.g., FF11012345 = MHU-110 or FF25F12345 = 25FT). (T-2). Units will update trailer container locations in CAS. (T-2).    102  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 7.1.5.4.3.  Transportation Modules (Mods):  Load the two-position wing designator as position  1  and  2,  the  three-digit  module  type as  position  3  thru  5,  and  the  five-digit assigned  S/N  as  position  6  thru  10  (e.g.,  FFB3312345  =  BDU-33,  FFRKT12345  = rockets,  or  FFC-F12345  =  Chaff-Flare).  (T-2).    Units  that  have  loaded  containers under  Chaff  and/or  Flare  type  must  move  the  containers  to  the  “Chaff-Flare” type.  Units will update module container locations in CAS. (T-2). 7.1.5.4.4.  Ammunition Loaders:  Load the two-position wing designator as position 1 and 2, the three-digit loader type as position 3 thru 5, and the five-digit assigned S/N as  position  6  thru  10  (e.g.,  FFALS12345  =  ALS,  FFLAL12345  =  LAL,  or FFUAL12345  =  UALS).  (T-2).    Units  will  update  ammunition  loader  container locations in CAS. (T-2). 7.1.5.4.5.  Magazines: Chaff/Flare, Chaff, Flare Magazines (MAGS):  Load the two-position wing designator as position 1 and 2, the three-digit MAG type as position 3 thru  5,  and  the  five-digit  assigned  S/N  as  position  6  thru  10  (e.g.,  FFA4812345  = ALE-48,  FFA5012345  =  ALE-50,  FFCFM12345  =  Chaff/Flare  magazine). (T-2).  Units are not required to update magazine container locations in CAS. 7.1.5.4.6.  ISO  Containers:    Load  the  four-digit  ISO  designator  as  position  1  thru  4 (e.g., USAF or USFU) and the 6-digit S/N as position 5 thru 10 (i.e., USAF123456). (T-2).    Units  will  update  ISO  container  locations  in  CAS  when  loaded  with explosives. (T-1). 7.1.5.4.7.  Missile  Containers:  To  facilitate  updated  NEWQD  capabilities  in  CAS, missile  container  IDs  will  be  loaded  as  follows:    Load  the  two-digit  aircraft  wing designator as position 1 and 2, the three-digit container type as position 3 thru 5, and the five-digit assigned container S/N as position 6 thru 10 (e.g., FF43112345 = CNU-431  or  FF35512345  =  CNU-355).  (T-1).    Units  will  update  missile  container locations in CAS when they contain missiles. (T-1). 7.1.5.4.8.  SDB  (BRU-61  Racks):  To  facilitate  managing  individual  SDB  munitions loaded  on  BRU-61  racks,  SDB  container  IDs  will  be  loaded  as  follows:    Load  the three-digit  SDB  (BRU-61  =  B61)  container  type  as  position  1  thru  3,  the  two-digit Part  Number  (P/N)  code  (P/N-103  =  AA;  P/N-105  =  AB;  P/N-109  =  BA;  and  P/N-111 = CA) as position 4 and 5, and the five-digit assigned container S/N as position 6 thru 10.  EXAMPLE: B61AB12345 = BRU-61, P/N-105). (T-1).  Units will update SDB locations on SDB (BRU-61) containers. (T-1). 7.1.6.  NWRM  Management.  Effective  management,  accountability,  Positive  Inventory Control (PIC), and Total Asset Visibility (TAV) is essential for classified munitions assets, to include all CAS-managed NWRM items.  This chapter provides specific CAS management processes and procedures (receipt, in-check, inspection, stockpile surveillance, warehousing, inventory, accountability, shipment, etc.) applicable to all classified munitions assets.  Refer to AFI 20-110 for NWRM roles, responsibilities, designating NWRM assets, and discrepancy reporting  procedures;  and  AFI  24-203  for  NWRM  transportation  documentation,  marking, and  packaging.    These  publications  must  be  used  in  conjunction  with  this  instruction  for complete  NWRM  management.    The  following  requirements  apply  to  all  CAS-managed NWRM: AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   103  7.1.6.1.  Nomenclatures for CAS-managed NWRM NSNs will be preceded by “NWRM” in the IDR. (T-0). 7.1.6.2.  All NWRM assets in shipment are subject to Classified and Sensitive Munitions Shipment oversight and validation procedures IAW  paragraph  7.13.4.7 before NWRM shipments are removed from the CAS Intransit Table. (T-0). Any individual who suspects they have discovered a NWRM discrepancy shall immediately notify the MASO. (T-1). 7.1.6.3.  Maintenance processing for CAS-managed NWRM: 7.1.6.3.1.  Account for, track, and control NWRM by S/N on the stock record account throughout the entire maintenance process. (T-1).  Except to DIFM issue for end item installation,  CAS-managed  NWRM  will  not  be  processed  off  CAS  accountable records  during  maintenance  processing  for  any  reason.  (T-1).    Include  these procedures in the local Movement Control OI IAW paragraph 5.1.1.4. (T-0). 7.1.6.3.2.  Use  DIFM  consumption  issue  procedures  IAW  paragraph  7.10.2.3.3  for NWRM items issued to replace installed components.  (T-1). 7.1.6.3.3.  DIFM  issued  NWRM  assets  disassembled  for  maintenance  are  subject  to inventory procedures IAW Attachment 3. (T-0). 7.1.6.3.4.  NWRM disassembled or removed from a higher level assembly during the maintenance process are not required to be picked up on the stock record account if the  item  is  intended  to  be  reassembled  or  installed  during  the  same  maintenance action (periodic inspection, reentry system recycle, depot overhaul, etc.). (T-3). 7.1.6.3.5.  When  NWRM  higher  level  assemblies  are  disassembled  ensure  that  the S/Ns of any embedded NWRM undergoing a maintenance action are recorded in the appropriate  Work  Control  Document/Work  Order,  IT  or  AFMC  depot  maintenance system for depot maintenance actions. (T-1). 7.1.6.3.6.  Regardless  of  physical  possession  or  location,  any  NWRM  asset  that  is DIFM issued and removed or  NWRM that is disassembled for maintenance and not subsequently  reinstalled,  replaced,  or  reassembled  in  the  same  maintenance  action will  be  picked  up  on  the  CAS  stock  record  account  within  24  hours  of  the disassembly or removal action. (T-1). 7.1.6.3.7.  All disassembled or removed NWRM that is no longer required for issue or reassembly will be tagged to identify asset identification, S/N tracking, and condition code  status.  (T-0).    Continue  to  account  for,  track,  and  control  NWRM  assets  after partial demilitarization, removal of lower assemblies/parts for repair or safing even if the  asset  is  no  longer  able  to  perform  the  function  leading  to  its  designation  as NWRM.  (T-1).  Track  these  assets  until  they  are  disposed  of  IAW  IM,  GACP,  and AFNWC instructions. (T-1). 7.1.6.3.8.  If  any  NWRM  asset,  sub-assembly,  partially  demilitarized,  safed,  or incomplete NWRM asset is reassigned a new NSN that is not on the NWRM listing for  any  reason  (TO,  higher  level  guidance,  removed  from  NWRM  list,  data  plate replaced,  etc.)  and  the  CAS  IDR  is  updated  to  reflect  the  NSN,  then  the  new  NSN does  not  require  NWRM  tracking,  control,  and  accountability.    Prior  to  NSN   104  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 reassignment notify the NWRM NSN IM IAW AFI 20-110 to maintain PIC tracking. (T-1). 7.1.6.3.9.  If  the  partially  demilitarized,  safed  or  incomplete  item  is  reassigned  a different  NSN  then  create  and  process  a  Demilitarization  Certificate  IAW  DoDM 4160.28, Vol. 3. (T-1). 7.1.6.3.10.  Maintenance personnel will use the item TO to promptly identify NWRM and  complete  appropriate  maintenance  documentation  (DD  Form  1500  series  tags, AF Form 4387, AF Forms 4388, AFTO Form 350, etc.). (T-1).  Ensure unserviceable NWRM  assets  from  maintenance  processing  are  segregated  from  NWRM  and  non-NWRM assets IAW paragraph 5.3.2.4. (T-0). 7.1.6.3.11.  For  NWRM  in  maintenance  or  an  installed  status,  the  organization responsible for documenting maintenance actions for the system shall ensure internal tracking,  work  control  documents  (e.g.,  work  orders),  build  up  sheets,  or configuration  records  reflect  that  NWRM  is  involved. (T-1).  Completed  documents and records shall reflect the NWRM asset S/N and be reported IAW 00-20-series TOs and AFI 21-series instructions. (T-1). 7.1.6.4.  NWRM  Packing,  Marking,  and  Documentation  Procedures:    Specific  packing and  marking  procedures  for  NWRM  are  included  in  item  specific  TOs,  Air  Force published  Special  Packaging  Instructions  (SPI),  web-enabled  Performance  Oriented Packaging  site;  11N-35-51,  General  Instructions  Applicable  to  Nuclear  Weapons;  AFI 24-203,  Preparation  and  Movement  of  Air  Force  Cargo;  MIL-STD  2073-1,  Standard Practice  for  Military  Packaging;  MIL-STD-129,  Military  Marking  for  Shipment  and Storage; MIL-STD 130, Identification Marking of US Military Property, AFI 21-201, and AFI  23-101.    NWRM  containing  hazardous  materials  shall  be  packed,  marked,  labeled and  documented  IAW  DTR  4500.9-R,  Defense  Transportation  Regulation,  Part  2  and AFMAN 24-204_IP. Refer to paragraph 3.24.2 for NWRM UII requirements. (T-0). 7.1.6.4.1.  Certified Munitions Inspectors/other technical specialists will be appointed and trained to pack NWRM. (T-1). 7.1.6.4.2.  NWRM packaging waivers are submitted IAW AFI 24-203 when required. (T-1). 7.1.6.4.3.  Verify that packaged items, quantities, markings, and associated paperwork are  correct.  Inspect  contents  of  a  package  when  evidence  of  tampering  is  found  or when packing discrepancies are identified. (T-1). 7.1.6.4.4.  Prepare  AF  Form  4387,  Outbound  Transportation  Protective  Service Material Checklist, and complete Section I prior to presenting NWRM for shipment to the base transportation activity.  The transportation activity will verify completion of the AF Form 4387 prior to processing shipment.  (T-1). 7.1.6.4.5.  Two  personnel  will  pack  NWRM  and  complete  related  packing documents. (T-1).  One  individual  shall  perform  packing  and  the  second  individual shall perform verification of the packing. (T-1). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   105  7.1.6.4.6.  Ensure a new DD Form 1500 series condition tag is completed and signed for  each  individual  NWRM  asset  regardless  of  condition  code  whenever  NWRM  is packed or repacked.  (T-0). Note:  Opening a container to retrieve documents does not require completion of new DD Form 1500 series condition tags.   7.1.6.4.7.  Identify  discrepancies  between  the  TO  and  asset  markings  to  the  MASO and AFSC NWRM Transaction Control Cell (NTCC) for resolution.  (T-1). 7.1.6.4.8.  All passive RFID labels placed on NWRM shipping/packaging containers will  be  rendered  inoperative  when  the  NWRM  asset  is  removed  from  the container.  The  embedded  antennae  and  tag  will  be  sliced  through  will  be  spray painted over. (T-1). 7.1.7.  Local National Stock Numbers (NSN).  Local NSNs are used to manage munitions, explosives,  and  munitions  associated  assets  in  CAS  to  provide  accountability,  visibility, management, and control of items that are not otherwise stock-listed. 7.1.7.1.  Local NSNs are created using CAS Load Local IDR/IDR Challenge (AMD03A). (T-1). 7.1.7.2.  Assets  with  a  P/N  greater  than  8  characters  will  be  loaded  with  a  Local  “L” identifier in CAS as a local stock number.  (T-2).  In this case, a P/N “P” identifier will not  be used  in  the National Item Identification Number field.  (T-2).  CAS will truncate any  digits  beyond  the  “P”  plus  the  8  character  P/N  causing  the  asset  to  lose  its  P/N identity.  This constitutes a valid requirement to assign an “L” control in CAS.  Units are not required to submit an AF IMT 86, Request for Cataloging Data/Action.  Local NSN’s will  utilize  an  FSC  matching  that  of  like  items. (T-1).  Example:  For  small  arms (1305L1234567890). 7.1.7.3.  If no P/N exists for non-accountable containers that are not stock listed, enter the following data elements as shown and enter any remaining data elements as required: 7.1.7.3.1.  Local  Stock  Number:  Load  “8140”  and  SPI/DWG  number.  (T-3).  EXAMPLE:  “8140-F004272123”. 7.1.7.3.2.  Unit Cost:  “0.01”. (T-3). Note:    If  the  unit  procured  non-accountable  boxes,  packaging,  or  crates  locally,  use  the  local procurement cost per container. 7.1.7.3.3.  Source of Supply:  “999”. (T-3). 7.1.7.3.4.  Noun:  Use a plain language description of  the non-accountable container (Wirebound Crate RR-170 Chaff, 20mm Ammo Trays, etc.) (T-3). 7.2.  MASO Management of Munitions. 7.2.1.  Establishing  a  DoDAAC  and  Operating the  Munitions  Stock  Record Account.  The  MASO  establishes  a  DoDAAC  IAW  paragraph  9.1.    There  is  only  one appointed MASO per DoDAAC and stock record account. (T-1).  An alternate MASO is not authorized. (T-1).  As such, the MASO operates the munitions account and may pre-appoint delegates,  in  writing,  to  operate  and  manage  account  activity  to  include  signing  specified   106  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 documents  and  listings.  The  MASO  will  sign  the  certificate  of  transfer  and  all  inventory adjustments. (T-0). 7.2.2.  MASO  Task  Accomplishment  and  Delegations.  Specific  MASO  accomplished tasks,  authorities,  and  responsibilities  that  can  be  delegated  are  outlined  within  Table  7.1, MASO  Task  Accomplishment  and  Delegations  Authority.    The  MASO  ensures  required documentation  is  controlled  IAW  Attachment  5  and  signed  IAW  Attachment  5,  Table A5.1. (T-1). 7.2.2.1.  The  term  “MASO  will”  indicates  a  task/responsibility  accomplished  by  the MASO.    These  tasks  will  only  be  delegated  when  the  MASO  is  absent  from  the  duty section  for  at  least  one  entire  duty  day.  (T-2).    This  “absence”  rule  applies  to  MASO accomplished tasks listed in the left column of Table 7.1.  NWRM tasks/responsibilities will not be delegated. (T-1). 7.2.2.2.  The  term  “MASO  must  ensure”  indicates  a  task/responsibility  that  the  MASO can  delegate  even  when  not  absent  from  the  duty  section.    These  tasks  are  listed  in  the right  column  of  Table  7.1.

MASO:   Ensures  forecasts  are  submitted  and  allocation  procedures  followed IAW the guidance in this AFI, GACP PCAR memorandum, MAJCOM munitions staff, and data provided from MUFMs. (T-2). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   111  7.3.1.1.1.  The  MASO  is  responsible  for  AMST  validation  of  unit  level  Host command  forecasts  and  other  using  command  forecasts  that  have  been  validated  by the  assigned  custodian  prior  to  the  assigned  MAJCOM  due  date.  (T-2).  Remaining forecast records are the responsibility of the using MAJCOM MUFM. (T-2). 7.3.1.1.2.  The MAJCOM MUFMs are responsible for PCAR forecasts identified for MUFM level validation. (T-2).  The applicable MAJCOM suspense date will apply. 7.3.1.1.3.  The  MASO  validates  that  forecasts  were  input,  but  does  not  validate  the functional user’s requirements. (T-2). 7.3.1.2.  MUFM:  The MUFM is the central focal point for all functional area munitions requirements for base level users assigned to or within their functional areas. (T-1).  The MUFM  ensures  that  functional  area  munitions  forecasts  are  prepared,  submitted,  and managed  IAW  AFI  21-201  and  annual  PCAR  guidance  for  their  functional  area.  (T-1).  Additionally, the MUFM shall: 7.3.1.2.1.  Task  each  subordinate  unit  to  develop  and  submit  requirements  to  the MUFM  or  the  MUFM  may  centrally  develop  and  submit  their  functional requirements.  (T-2).  If  the  MUFM  does  not  develop  functional  requirements centrally,  notify  and  direct  subordinate  units  to  seek  assistance  from  the  MASO  to developing their forecast for submission to the MUFM. (T-2). 7.3.1.2.2.  Develop  (e.g.,  collect,  consolidate,  and  validate)  or  consolidate  their functional area munitions requirements forecast and submit the consolidated forecast. (T-1). 7.3.1.2.2.1.  Validate  all  unit  or  consolidated  forecasts  for  accuracy  and completeness (e.g., CRC, DODIC, and NSN) on the consolidated forecasts using the capabilities of the AMST Forecast Allocation Module (FAM). (T-1). 7.3.1.2.2.2.  Submit  forecasts  in  the  AMST  FAM  on  the  GACP  website  for inclusion in the 5-year munitions forecast. (T-1). 7.3.1.2.3.  Seek  assistance  from  the  MASO  or  MAJCOM/NAF  munitions  staff  (or equivalent)  to  build  and  submit  forecasts.  (T-3).    The  munitions  staff  does  not validate other functional area user requirements. (T-2). 7.3.1.3.  Account  Custodians:  Request  and  obtain  general-user  access  to  AMST  if required to submit a munitions forecast. (T-1).  Once the custodian has obtained AMST access, request level 6 access to the AMST FAM. (T-1). 7.3.2.  Missiles.  To  support  CMT  and  Weapons  Load  Training,  units  will  only  forecast  for non-expendable  DATM/CATM  missiles  IAW  the  AF  Standard  For  Non-expendable Airmunitions Training guide. (T-1).  Units will not forecast for AIM/CATM requirements for expendable  or  non-expendable  Aircrew  munitions.  (T-1).    ACC/A3TW  centrally  forecasts for these assets IAW AFI 11-212. 7.3.3.  NWRM.  Forecasts, allocations, and distribution activity for CAS-managed explosive and  non-explosive  NWRM  assets  is  a  coordinated  process  between  MAJCOMs,  GACP, AFNWC,  AFNWC/NC,  and  applicable  SPOs.  All  NWRM  Item  Mangers  (IM) for  CAS-managed NWRM assets will receive IM training and fulfill IM responsibilities IAW AFI 20-110. (T-1).   112  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 7.3.3.1.  CAS-managed  NWRM  is  forecasted  by  field  units  through  the  MAJCOM  or centrally  by  the  SPO  to  the  AFNWC  or  GACP.  The  GACP  is  the  allocation,  Out-of-Cycle Request (OOCR), and distribution approval authority for CAS-managed explosive NWRM.  The  AFNWC/NCL  or  the  SPO  is  the  allocation,  OOCR,  and  distribution approval  authority  (via  the  GACP)  for  CAS-managed  non-explosive  NWRM.  Once  an allocation  change  is  approved,  the  AFNWC/NC  SPO  coordinates  with  the  GACP  to change the DLAR using AMST. 7.3.3.2.  The AFNWC/NCL and applicable SPOs reviews and updates requirements and allocations annually and submits approved allocations to the GACP for update in AMST by 31 July each calendar year. 7.3.3.3.  The  MASO  at  an  installation/base  with  NWRM  requirements  will  validate forecasts for all CAS-managed NWRM assets. (T-1).  In some cases, host/user command relationships  are  established  to  differentiate  between  managing  and  using  Commands.  EXAMPLE:  Trainers used by an Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) unit but managed by a MASO assigned to AFMC on the same base. 7.3.4.  WRM  Mobility,  CAT  Code  B.  Forecast  for  miscellaneous  mobility  munitions covered  in  AFCAT  21-209,  Volume  1,  Ground  Munitions,  using  the  Ground  Munitions Authorization  Tables  (GMAT)  for  Ground  Munitions  located  on  the  GACP  website.  (T-1).  Forecast  these  ground  munitions  under  a  single  wing  mobility  account,  ORG/SHP  code 002BP  and  FUC  L4.  (T-1).    ORG/SHP  account  002BP  is  a  forecasting  and  allocation management account only; units will not expend these  assets from the stock record account or against ORG/SHP 002BP. (T-1). Note:  MAJCOMs may provide additional guidance for units managing multiple command code mobility requirements from a single stock record account. 7.3.4.1.  CAT  Code  B  munitions  requirements  will  be  validated  by  the  functional  areas they  support  (e.g.,  Security  Forces,  Civil  Engineers)  and  coordinated  through  the Installation Deployment Officer (IDO). (T-1). 7.3.4.2.  Prior to forecasting for unit CAT Code B assets the MUFM will coordinate with gaining  MASO,  or  MAJCOM/NAF  to  ensure  assets  are  not  already  positioned  and stocked in-place to support deployment. (T-1). 7.3.5.  Cartridge  Actuated  Device/Propellant  Actuated  Device  (CAD/PAD)  TCI.  Units forecast  for CAD/PAD items listed in TO 00-20-9, Forecasting  Replacement  Requirements for Selected Calendar and Hourly Time Change Items, Table 4.1, and IAW AFI 21-101. (T-1). 7.3.5.1.

Approved  COTS  munitions  maintained  longer than  one  year  from  approval  date, require annual revalidation. (T-1). requisition for 7.3.8.1.  Long-term  Munitions  Requirements:    The  COTS  process  is  not  established  to support  long-term  munitions  requirements.   Units  identify  long-term  munitions requirements  through  the  Lead  MAJCOM/NAF  MUFM  to  the  Air  Staff  functional  user agency.  The  Air  Staff  functional  (using)  agency  develops  and  submits  a  Capability Production  Document  (CPD)  to  the  appropriate  ALC  for  long-term  procurement, sustainment strategies, cataloging, and management. (T-1). 7.3.8.2.  COTS Munitions Approval Process:  COTS munitions will not be purchased or used  until  final  written approval  is obtained  from  the  GACP  COTS  Munitions  Program Manager  (CMPM). (T-1).  The  approval  process  assures  safety  and  health  of  Air  Force personnel and asset accountability in support of operational requirements.   114  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 Exception:  AFMC/A4M  develops  and  coordinate  COTS  guidance  for  all  AFMC  RDT&E activities.

(T-1). 7.3.8.4.  Munitions Systems Management Determination:  After Installation Commander approval, the MASO submits the COTS request package for review and determination by the MAJCOM functional user agency (e.g., MUFM) and Lead MAJCOM/NAF munitions staff  that  the  COTS  munitions  are  appropriate  for  munitions  systems  management.    If approved,  the  MASO  submits  the  COTS  package  to  the  GACP  CMPM  through  the GACP website for final approval. Note:  Units at locations with no MASO may be granted access to the GACP website on a case by case basis. 7.3.8.5.  Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program: 7.3.8.5.1.  BASH  munitions  must  be  approved  by  GACP  and  the  NNMSB  using COTS approval procedures IAW paragraph 7.3.8.2. 7.3.8.5.2.

A unit’s allocation is the quantity of a munition NSN that is expected to be available to a unit within the designated FY.  The allocation provides authorization to requisition and use an item for its allocated purpose.  Each base’s portion of the  command  allocation  is  distributed  to  the  MASO  via  AMST.    The  MAJCOM/NAF  may review,  realign,  or  adjust  unit  allocations  based  on  theater  positioning  objectives,  unit requirements, and storage capabilities.  Allocations are managed continuously throughout the munitions  operational  flow  process timely  processing,  visibility,  and accountability. to  maintain 7.4.1.1.  MASO:    Within  2  duty  days  of  the  new  FY  allocations  being  auto-loaded  in CAS (e.g., 27 to 30 Sep), compare the CAS Organizational Record Listing (AM513) to the  AF  Form  68  and  AMST  to  validate  that  all  ORG/SHP  codes,  host/user  relationship   118  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 codes,  and  Functional  User  Codes  (FUC)  are  loaded  correctly.  (T-1).  The  MASO  will ensure  only  one  FUC  is  assigned  to  each  individual  ORG/SHP  code  (e.g.,  separate ORG/SHP (T-1).  Additionally, the MASO shall: for  S3/Security  Forces,  C1/Combat  Arms,  S1/Dog  Training). 7.4.1.1.1.  Ensure  the  SAAR  system  is  used  through  the  GACP  website  for  all  non-Master Subsidiary Relationship Group (MSRG) managed assets. (T-1). Exception:  This  does  not  apply  to  approved  COTS  or  RDT&E  which  will  be  managed  IAW paragraph 7.3.8 and paragraph 7.16. 7.4.1.1.2.  Ensure allocations for flightline support are not consolidated into a single wing account. (T-1).  These allocations support ORG/SHP codes aligned to a specific AMU or Squadron. 7.4.1.1.3.  Approve/disapprove requests for munitions, missiles, and NWRM - TYPE Trainers  in  excess  of  non-expendable  allocations  left  on  custody  accounts  when  the organization has a valid requirement and has submitted an OOCR for the assets and the GACP, AFNWC, or SPO has not tasked the unit to ship these assets. (T-1).  CAS allocations will not be increased to support excesses. (T-1). 7.4.1.1.4.  Ensure customers are notified of excess munitions requiring turn-in action by  NSN,  quantity,  and  CAT  Code  NLT  7  duty  days  after  the  allocations  are  auto loaded in CAS. (T-2). 7.4.1.1.4.1.  Freeze  the  custody  account  and  take  action  IAW  paragraph  7.8.5 when the custodian does not schedule turn-in of identified excess. (T-2). 7.4.1.1.4.2.  Ensure  excess  munitions  expended  after  MASO  notification  are processed using OOCR procedures IAW paragraph 7.4.2. (T-1). allocations 7.4.1.2.  MUFM:  Once all theater/command  positioning  decisions  in  AMST  prior  to  the  GAP  working  group convening.    Coordinate  and  submit  OOCR  and  ATR  when  requirements  change, transferring  allocations  within  their  functional  area,  and  for  munitions  availability according to paragraph 7.4.2 and paragraph 7.4.3. the  MUFM are released, finalizes 7.4.1.3.  Account  Custodians:    Schedules  turn-in  of  non-expendable  and  expendable munitions  excess  allocations  with  Munitions  Inspection  within  14  calendar  days  of MASO notification. (T-2).  Turns-in all excess annually NLT 15 Nov. (T-1). 7.4.2.  Out  of  Cycle  Request  (OOCR).  Using  organizations  request  allocation  increases using  the  OOCR  process  in  AMST.  (T-1).    Assets  are  allocated  based  on  available  and projected  stocks  and  may  not  be  100-percent  supportable.   OOCRs  for  assets  that were  not 100-percent  allocated  may  not  be  approved.    The  MUFM/MASO  may  be  contacted  for guidance on submitting OOCRs. 7.4.2.1.  Only submit OOCR for allocated expendable assets when at least 70-percent of the allocation has been expended in CAS. (T-1).  Future anticipated expenditures will not be used to satisfy the 70-percent expenditure requirement. (T-1). 7.4.2.2.  If end of FY expenditures are not processed in CAS prior to the FY cutoff IAW paragraph  7.11.4,  and  there  is  no  “new”  FY  allocation  the  MASO  will  ensure  the AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   119  appropriate  MUFM  is  contacted  who  will  support  requirements  from  the  “new”  FY allocation or direct an OOCR be submitted. (T-2).  In this case, submit the OOCR within 15-calendar  days  of  processing  the  prior  FY  expenditure  for  the  quantity  of  assets expended. (T-2). 7.4.2.3.  OOCR for all other items, OOCR for OCONUS MAJCOMs, and OOCR for new munitions  requirements  (e.g.,  mission  changes)  may  be  submitted  at  any  time  with sufficient justification. 7.4.2.4.  Prior to submitting an OOCR for munitions other than aircrew training: 7.4.2.4.1.  The  custodian  will  initiate  the  OOCR  in  AMST  by  citing  the  authorizing directive, formula, and expenditure data (if applicable). (T-1). 7.4.2.4.2.  The  MASO  will  ensure  OOCR  data  and  reported  expenditures  are validated. (T-1).  If valid, the MASO may convert the OOCR to an ATR and transfer from  other  accounts  within  their  stock  record  account;  when  they  contain  the  same “Using” command code.  The MASO may also redistribute unused allocations within the stock record account by completing an ATR in AMST IAW paragraph 7.4.3. 7.4.2.4.3.  If  the  OOCR  is  not  supportable,  the  MASO  will  ensure  the  OOCR  is updated in AMST. (T-1).  The OOCR is automatically forwarded to the next review level. 7.4.2.4.4.  The  MUFM  with  MAJCOM/NAF  munitions  staff  assistance  will  attempt to transfer allocations between functional areas within their responsible areas.  (T-1).  Allocation transfers from non-expendable to expendable CAT Codes require approval from  AFSFC/SFXW  for  ground  munitions,  AFCEC/CXD  for  Explosive  Demolition materials, and AF/A5R-C for air-munitions and associated components. (T-1). 7.4.2.4.5.  When  reviewing,  processing,  and  approving  OOCRs,  the  MUFM, MAJCOM/NAF  munitions  staff,  and  GACP  work  closely  to  avoid  unnecessary munitions movements.  Source and consolidate munitions movements using the most economical means possible. 7.4.2.4.6.  If  the  MUFM  with  MAJCOM/NAF  assistance  cannot  support  an  OOCR they will finalize, forward, or deny the OOCR in AMST. (T-1). 7.4.3.  Allocation  Transfer  Requests  (ATR).  ATRs  are  submitted  to  support  Weapons Training  Deployments,  exercises,  competitions,  demonstrations,  test,  or  training.    After coordination  with  the  MAJCOM/NAF  MUFM,  the  MASO  submits  an  ATR  in  the  AMST FAM. (T-1).  Process ATRs IAW the Air Force Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide posted on the AF MC2 SharePoint® site and the following: 7.4.3.1.  Asset  availability,  rather  than  the  transfer  timeline,  is  the  primary  basis  for determining  whether  munitions  support  can  be  provided  by  the  host  unit.    MASOs  and units will make every effort to support the transfer timeline. 7.4.3.2.  The  losing  MASO  will  ensure  the  unit  has  sufficient  allocations  to  support exercise  requirements  and  pass  allocations  to  the  supporting  MASO  not  later  than  60 calendar  days  in  the  Continental  United  States  (CONUS)  and  90  calendar  days  Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) before the exercise begins. (T-2).   120  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 7.4.3.3.  The  losing/gaining  MASOs  will  ensure  the  allocation  transfer  is  processed  in CAS IAW the Air Force Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide within 14 calendar days  of  the  ATR  date.  (T-2).    The  gaining  MASO  and  MAJCOM/NAF  will  notify  the losing MASO and MAJCOM/NAF of supportability by updating AMST NLT 7 calendar days after date of the ATR. (T-2). 7.4.3.4.  The  gaining  MASO  has  requisition  (stock  control)  responsibility  for  all increased or transferred allocations provided the time requirements in paragraph 7.4.3.3 are met. (T-1). 7.4.3.5.  Within  14  calendar  days  of  event  completion  (e.g.,  exercise,  test)  the  host  unit will  complete  the  After  Action  Report  (AAR)  on  the  GACP  website  using  the  original ATR number. (T-2). 7.4.3.6.  Within  7  calendar  days  of  receiving  the  AAR  the  losing/gaining  MASO  will ensure allocations that remain from the event are processed in CAS. (T-2). 7.4.4.  Stock  Levels.  Stock  levels enable  management  of  physical  stock  against  allocations and positioning  objectives.   Levels are established in  CAS as  authorized by the DLAR and MAJCOM/NAF instructions.  The MASO will ensure: 7.4.4.1.  Stock  levels  in  CAS  are  validated  and  maintained  IAW  the  DLAR  and MAJCOM/NAF  instructions  and  notifies  custodians  when  their  approved  annual allocations are available in AMST. (T-1). 7.4.4.2.  New  FY  stock  levels  are  validated  and  accurately  loaded  in  CAS.  (T-1).  New FY expenditures will not be processed until the new FY levels have been validated.  (T-1). 7.4.4.3.  The GACP is notified using the CRM of any host/user relationship or stock level allocation discrepancies. (T-1). 7.4.4.4.  The  SAAR  system  is  used  through  the  GACP  website  for  all  non-MSRC managed assets. (T-1). Exception:    This  does  not  apply  to  approved  COTS  or  RDT&E  which  will  be  managed  IAW paragraph 7.3.8 and paragraph 7.16. 7.4.5.  WRM Aircraft Munitions Levels.  Munitions Supervision and MASOs will: Note:  This  AFI  takes  precedence  over  AFI  25-101  for  matters  related  to  CAS  processing, munitions warehouse management, and accounting processes for CAS-managed munitions. 7.4.5.1.  Train personnel to manage all aspects of WRM levels throughout the munitions operational flow process. (T-2). 7.4.5.2.  Actively  monitor  WRM  allocations  and  stock  levels  against  on-hand  stock balances to ensure WRM levels remain supportable. (T-1).  Review current WRM levels against on-hand CAS balances using the Level Reconciliation Listing (AMC12A). (T-3). 7.4.5.3.  Communicate shortfalls and constraints with commanders, MAJCOM, NAF, and GACP. (T-1). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   121  7.4.5.4.  Maintain  built-up  assets  and  components  on  the  stock  record  account.  (T-1).  Stock assets will not be designated as WRM or segregated from other stock assets prior to  expenditure.  (T-1).    Once  expended,  assets  are  categorized  as  WRM  (or  other appropriate  category)  and  a  CAS  expenditure  will  be  processed  against  the  appropriate ORG/SHP code and CAT Code. (T-1). 7.4.5.5.  Munitions  assets  may  be  physically  stored  at  Geographically  Separated  Units (GSU)/remote  locations  (e.g.,  another  base,  installation,  or  region)  to  support  WRM requirements.  In this case, account for assets on the stock record account assigned to the physical  storage  base/installation,  or  on  a  host  stock  record  account  if  there  is  no DoDAAC established.  If accounted for on a host stock record account, load appropriate storage structures and storage locations to manage asset locations. 7.4.5.6.  WRM  levels  for  CAT  Code  G  and  X  may  be  provided  by  the  MAJCOM/NAF via a WCDO.  WRM levels for CAT Code F and T are provided by the MAJCOM/NAF via AMST.  AF/A5R-C provides CAT Code Z (STAMP) allocations centrally. 7.4.5.7.  Load WRM air munitions levels for CAT Code G, X, and Z against ORG/SHP code 002WR. (T-1).  Load WRM air munitions levels for CAT Code F and T against the appropriate squadron ORG/SHP code as reflected in AMST. (T-1). Note: Allocations loaded against ORG/SHP code 002WR are positioning objectives only and do not restrict munitions expenditure to support valid WRM, combat, or contingency operations. 7.4.6.  WRM Mobility, CAT Code B.  The MASO manages WRM Mobility, CAT Code B munitions allocations and accounts as follows: 7.4.6.1.  Unless otherwise authorized in this AFI, manage CAT Code B munitions on the stock  record  account.  (T-1).    This  increases  logistics  flexibility  in  support  of  various levels  of  effort,  reduces inventories, management,  and  administrative tasks  for  accounts with little or no activity. 7.4.6.2.  CAT  Code  B  allocated  mobility  munitions  will  not  be  physically  segregated while in base stock. (T-1). 7.4.6.3.  CAT  Code  B  assets  being  deployed  will  either  be  shipped  from  stock  record account  to  the  deployed  location  DoDAAC  for  subsequent  issue;  or  issued  to  custody accounts prior to deployment and managed from the home station custody account. (T-2). 7.4.6.3.1.  Except  when  authorized  IAW  paragraph  7.4.6.5,  assets  will  not  be issued/released  prior  to  receipt  of  execution  or  mobilization  order;  or  prior  to coordination with the IDO. (T-1). Exception:  During local exercises, physical assets may be broken out, staged, and processed for deployment  as  “bulk-shipped”  assets.    Generate  shipping  documents  using  the  CAS  training database. 7.4.6.3.2.  Proper  security  and  transfer  documentation  will  be  completed  for  these assets IAW paragraph 7.6.4 whether real-world or exercise. (T-1). 7.4.6.4.  The  MASO  may  submit  ATRs  to  allocate  the  next  higher  QUP  for  mobility accounts.  If  the  ATR  is  approved,  units  may  ship  CAT  Code  B  mobility  assets  to  the nearest  QUP.    EXAMPLE:    The  GMAT  authorizes  90  rds,  27  rds  are  allocated  IAW   122  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 paragraph  14.2.4  (e.g.,  90  rds  x  .30  =  27  rds).    The  MASO  would  submit  an  ATR  to increase the allocation to 30 rds allowing deployment of 2 full clips (2 clips x 15 rds = 30 rds). 7.4.6.5.  When  an  organization/functional  user  requests  issue  of  CAT  Code  B  allocated munitions  before  receipt  of  an  execution/mobilization  order,  they  must  provide justification  to  the  MASO  and  IDO.  (T-2).    The  MASO  advises  the  IDO  on  whether management of a separate custody account is justified by the need. (T-3).  The IDO shall only consider issuing CAT Code B ammunition to custody accounts when: 7.4.6.5.1.  Mission  circumstances  dictate  immediate  access  to  munitions  and  local issue/shipment procedures cannot support required deployment timelines. (T-2). 7.4.6.5.2.  The unit/organization frequently deploys with  munitions to locations with no established munitions DoDAAC. (T-2). 7.4.6.5.3.  Total  quantities  of  wing  allocations  can  support  segregation  of  specific unit’s CAT Code B mobility munitions allocation. (T-2). 7.4.6.5.4.  Sufficient CAT Code B allocations are not pre-positioned at the deployed location. the  gaining  MASO  or MAJCOM/NAF  munitions  staff  to  validate  assets  are  not  already  pre-positioned  to support deployed munitions requirements.   The  IDO  and  MASO  coordinate  with 7.4.6.6.  When the IDO and MASO allows/approves custody account(s) for CAT Code B munitions: 7.4.6.6.1.  Limit  custody  accounts  to  one  per  separate  residual  force  (i.e.,  PRIME BEEF, security forces, EOD, OSI, etc.). (T-2). 7.4.6.6.2.  Replacements  for  assets  deployed  from  home  station  will  not  be automatically  requisitioned. (T-1).  Requisitions  will  only  be  submitted  after expenditures are validated and processed; or shipments are processed removing assets from the stock record account. (T-1). 7.4.7.  CAD/PAD  TCI.  Plans and schedules generated at the quarterly  munitions  and P&S meeting  serve  as  the  MASO’s  authority  to  schedule  and  issue  authorized  TCI  assets  to  the maintenance  activity.  Assets  ordered  beyond  those  planned  and  scheduled  during  the quarterly meeting must be coordinated between the MASO and P&S. (T-3). 7.4.7.1.  Limit  on-hand  CAD/PAD  stock  balances  to  one  per  MDS  supported in  case  of inadvertent  firings  or  maintenance  defects.  (T-1).  Justify  additional  asset  balances through the IM by SAAR. (T-1). Exception:    If  an  item  has  an  AFTO  Form  223  for  scheduled  maintenance,  a  SAAR  is  not required to justify the consumption issue. 7.4.7.2.  MASOs may issue assets one calendar quarter ahead of their forecasted quarter without  IM  approval.  For  issue  requests  beyond  the  next  calendar  quarter,  the  using organization  coordinates  the  request  with  the  IM.   Document  coordination  with  the  IM and provide to the MASO as justification to issue assets ahead of schedule. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   123  7.4.7.3.  RDT&E  and  A&S  programs  will  follow  stock  level  guidance  developed  by AFMC/A4M.  (T-1).  The  AFMC/A4M  guidance  applies  to  all  agencies/activities supporting AFMC RDT&E and A&S activity regardless of host unit MAJCOM. 7.4.7.4.  TCI Extension Requests:  Home station PS&D personnel request TCI extensions IAW AFI 21-101 and TO 00-20-1 for all aircraft. (T-1).  The IM is authorized to direct inter-command  redistribution  of  CAD/PAD  parts  as  required  without  MAJCOM coordination. 7.4.7.5.  ICBM  and  Launch  Facility  TCI:    Load  stock  levels  for  ordnance  replacement assets  IAW  allocation  levels  approved  by  the  CAD/PAD-JPO,  AFLCMC/EBHJ,  Hill AFB, UT. (T-1). 7.4.7.6.  Transient  C-5,  C-17,  KC-10,  and  KC-135  Strategic  Airlift  Hubs:  Bases  or installations  supporting  transient  strategic  aircraft  may  submit  a  SAAR  to  request authorization  to  keep  one  complete  aircraft  system  load  of  TCI  on  hand  for  each  MDS common  to  that  base.  This  TCI  stock  supports  unforeseen/inadvertent  transient  aircraft firing or unforeseen maintenance incurred while away from home station. 7.4.7.6.1.  When  authorized  and  assets  are  on-hand  to  support  transient  aircraft, consumption issue time change items to an existing account using DIFM procedures IAW paragraph 7.10.2.3.3. 7.4.7.6.2.  When  assets  are  not  on-hand,  request  lateral  support  through  the  GACP. (T-3). 7.4.7.6.3.  The MASO requests disposition of serviceable excess CAD/PAD thru the GACP IAW paragraph 3.12.9. (T-1). 7.4.8.  Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE). 7.4.8.1.  AFE Replacement Munitions (Time Change):  Issue CAT Code A allocated AFE munitions using consumption issue and DIFM control procedures. (T-1). 7.4.8.2.  AFE  Munitions  Initial  Build-up:    Issue  CAT  Code  T  allocated  AFE  munitions using consumption issue and non-DIFM control procedures. (T-1).

There are two types of Issues: Consumption and Custody. 7.10.1.  General  Issue  Procedures.  In addition to specific consumption and custody issues procedures in paragraph 7.10.2 and paragraph 7.10.3, the following general procedures shall be followed: 7.10.1.1.  Munitions  users  will  submit  issue  requests  electronically  to  the  munitions organization, unless the MASO authorizes verbal or written requests (T-3). 7.10.1.2.  CAS-managed  NWRM  will  not  be  issued  on  an  AF  IMT  1297,  Temporary Issue  Receipt.  (T-1).  CAS-managed  NWRM  will  be  DIFM  issued  for  install,  issued  to custody account, or managed on the stock record in all cases. (T-1). 7.10.1.3.  Munitions will be issued in QUP or “LITE box” configuration, when possible, to limit creation of “non-standard” packaging not within SPI configuration. (T-1).  Non-standard packaging creates potential hazard class conflicts as described in TO 11A-1-10. 7.10.1.4.  All issue requests will include the following: 7.10.1.4.1.  ORG/Shop code. (T-1). 7.10.1.4.2.  Nomenclature. (T-1). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   145  7.10.1.4.3.  NSN. (T-1). 7.10.1.4.4.  Quantity. (T-1). 7.10.1.4.5.  CAT Code. (T-1). 7.10.1.4.6.  The  words  "CLASSIFIED  ITEM"  if  applicable.    Documents  associated with NWRM assets will be stamped “CLASSIFIED NWRM ITEM”. (T-1). 7.10.1.4.7.  Date and time required. (T-1). 7.10.1.4.8.  Issue type. (T-1). 7.10.1.4.9.  Grounding  date  (For  consumption  issue  for  aircraft  time  change  items). (T-1). 7.10.1.5.  Emergency  Issues:    An  emergency  issue  is  an  unforeseen  consumption  or custody issue requirement that may prevent a unit from performing its mission unless the munitions item can be issued and installed/consumed within 12 hours of issue. 7.10.1.5.1.  The  MUNS  Superintendent/Munitions  Flight  Chief  determines supportability.  If  Munitions  supervision  determines  the  request  is  supportable,  no emergency issue approval is required, or necessary.  7.10.1.5.2.  In cases of competing priorities (e.g., semi-annual inventories) emergency requests  will  be  justified  and  approved,  in  writing,  by  the  group  commander  or designated  representative  with  command  authority  over  the  munitions  issuing organization. request. (T-2).  Designated representatives to approve emergency issue requests will be appointed in writing and will not be lower than a unit commander. (T-1). (T-2).  The  approval  will  accompany the issue 7.10.2.  Consumption  Issues.  Consumption issues shall  be limited to  those assets that  will be consumed or installed within 15 calendar days (i.e., DIFM, Time Change). (T-1). Exception:  Shop  stock  issues,  RDT&E  activities,  and  SmACC  issues  are  not  bound  by  the  15 calendar day rule. 7.10.2.1.  If  the  requesting  or  storing  unit/activity  cannot  satisfy  storage,  security  or safety  requirements,  the  requesting  unit  shall  limit  consumption  issue  requests  to  the amount to be consumed on the day of issue. (T-1). 7.10.2.2.  Use consumption issues to manage CAT Code C, CAT Code D, and CAT Code E consumable assets (e.g., arming wire, swivel and links, ferrules, safety clips, lugs) for use  by  internal  and  external  requirements  (e.g.,  CMT,  SGO  training,  Load  Barn,  and RDT&E). (T-3).  If  consumption  issue  is  used,  control  the  consumable  parts  as  shop stock. (T-2). 7.10.2.3.  Consumption issues include SmACC, Stockpile Consumption, and DIFM: 7.10.2.3.1.  SmACC:  Will  only  be  used  to  issue  basic/combat  loads  of  5.56mm  and 9mm  small  arms  ammunition. (T-1).  SmACC  issues  relieve  the  MASO  of  physical and materiel accountability/liability for those assets and transfers accountability to the organization user and/or user’s chain of command.  When issuing ammunition using SmACC T procedures, unit MASO will ensure:   146  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 issues  are  authorized  (e.g.,  month,  FY,  until  authorization 7.10.2.3.1.1.  MAJCOM  or  NAF  munitions  staff  (or  equivalent)  approval  is obtained in writing before processing any SmACC issue within an active combat zone. (T-1).  The  approval  must  specify  the  DoDAAC  and  the  time  period  that SmACC is rescinded). (T-1).  The approval remains in effect for the stated period regardless of  MASO  appointment.   Any  rescission  and  re-approval  to  perform  SmACC issues  will  be  approved  by  the  MAJCOM/NAF  (T-1).    However  the  MASO  or local  commanders  may  place  SmACC  procedures  in  abeyance  locally  at  their discretion. 7.10.2.3.1.2.  SmACC issue procedures will not be used for any of the following: the 7.10.2.3.1.2.1.  Non-deployed  Operations individual/unit’s  permanently in  CONUS  or assigned OCONUS.    SmACC  issues  will  not  be  used  to  provide  personnel  deploying from CONUS to deployed combat locations. (T-1).

SmACC issues will only be processed to the default ORG/SHP code 920CC  under  CAT  Code  T.  (T-1).    An  AF  Form  68  is  not  generated  for ORG/SHP code 920CC. 7.10.2.3.1.4.  Before processing a SmACC issue, a copy of the individual’s orders will  be  obtained  and  maintained  with  the  original  consumption  issue  documents IAW the Air Force RDS in AFRIMS. (T-1). 7.10.2.3.1.5.  Relief from accountability for SmACC issues  occurs after  physical assets  are  turned  over  to  an  organizational  user  and  the  individual  has  been briefed  on  and  signed  the  SmACC  Issue  Acknowledgement  Statement  shown  in Figure 7.3, SmACC Issue Acknowledgement Statement. 7.10.2.3.1.6.  The  issuing  individual  (e.g.,  Munitions  Operations  or  Munitions Inspector)  will  ensure  the  SmACC  Issue  Acknowledgment  Statement  in  Figure 7.3 is printed on the back of the issue document (DD 1348-1, AF IMT 4331, etc.) and is signed by the receiver before releasing assets. (T-1). 7.10.2.3.2.  Stockpile Consumption Issue:  Used to issue assets from the stock record account  for  installation  or  use  (e.g.,  replace  AUR  components,  containers  to  be packed).    These  issues  will  be  processed  against  ORG/SHP  code  002SM. (T-AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   147  1).  These documents will be signed by munitions personnel authorized to receipt for munitions assets. (T-1).  An AF Form 68 is not required. 7.10.2.3.2.1.  The  MASO  may  consumption  issue  an  entire  QUP  of  shop  stock type  items  regardless  of  allocation  quantity,  (e.g.,  if  an  allocation  of  1,136  feet remains  for  arming  wire,  an  entire  roll  of  5K  feet  is  authorized  for issue).   Increase  the  remaining  allocation  Asset  Level  Stratification  (AMG04)  to allow  the  issue  of  the  asset,  then  reset  the  remaining  allocation  to  zero. Allocations  increases  above  the  initial  QUP  are  justified  using  the  ATR/OOCR process to issue quantities up to QUP. Figure 7.3.  SmACC Issue Acknowledgement Statement.  7.10.2.3.2.2.  If unused pieces and parts remain from a consumption issue and the parts  are  no  longer  required,  an  Expenditure  TIN  will  be  processed  IAW paragraph 7.12.4 to inspect and return parts to stock. (T-1). 7.10.2.3.2.3.  Units will ensure enough assets remain available on stock record to support CR builds and expenditures. (T-2). 7.10.2.3.2.4.  Use  the  consumption  issue  process  for  items  requiring  disposal  of explosive munitions by EOD. 7.10.2.3.2.4.1.  Use  the  “default”  EOD  ORG/SHP  code  920RW  under  CAT Code Y only assets requiring EOD disposal; refer to paragraph 3.13.7.5.  An AF Form 68 is not used for ORG/SHP code 920RW. 7.10.2.3.2.4.2.  The  MASO  correspondence  memorandum,  “Personnel Authorized  to  Dispose  of  Munitions”  provided  by  EOD  will  be  used  to validate personnel authorized to sign and date the CAS generated    148  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 document. (T-3).  The  signature  of  EOD  personnel  on  the  CAS  document shall constitute DEMIL certification; no additional signatures are required. (T-1). 7.10.2.3.3.  DIFM  Consumption  Issue:  Used  to  issue  high  value  and/or  field/depot repairable and reusable assets when return of a like item carcass is expected.  Unless otherwise  stated,  all  ERRC  code  “XD”  assets  will  be  issued  and  controlled  using DIFM  procedures. (T-1).  DIFM  will  not  be  used  for  any  air-launched/dropped munitions and their associated inert/dummy/training assets. (T-1).  CAS DIFM listing (AM535A) will be used to monitor DIFM assets to ensure they are returned within 15 calendar days. (T-1).  The 15 calendar day count will start from the date assets were physically received by the customer. (T-2). Exception: The MASO may extend the 15 calendar day DIFM return requirement to quarterly, without waiver, when a GSU location has no in place RegAF, ANG, or AFRC munitions activity to service DIFM activity.  This exception will not apply to any disposition instructions provided by the equipment specialist or DDA. (T-1).  7.10.2.3.3.1.  For  initial  issue  requests  the  “DIFM  bypass”  indicator  will  be used. (T-1). 7.10.2.3.3.2.  All replacement AFE munitions requirements, regardless of ERRC, will be consumption issued using DIFM procedures. (T-1). 7.10.2.3.3.3.  Each  owning  IM/ES  with  assets  managed  in  CAS,  regardless  of organizational assignment, will have an active CAS account and ensure the CAS IDR  is  current. (T-1).  The  owning  IM/ES  shall  ensure  that  all  CAS-managed NWRM items have the time change indicator set to “Y”. (T-1).  Notify the GACP via the CRM if the time change indicator for any CAS-managed NWRM asset is not set to “Y”. 7.10.3.  Custody  Issues.  A  custody  issue  is  used  to  supply  an  organization  with  munitions for the current FY period. 7.10.3.1.  DoDAACs  supporting  Air  Force  organic  depot  repair  of  munitions components, aircraft, and missiles (e.g., ALCs), and RDT&E activities, may issue ERRC code  “XD”  and  time-change  assets  to  custody  accounts  when  supported  assets  are expected to be in repair, or used in support of test plans, for longer than 15-calendar days. 7.10.3.2.  Secure  facilities  and  adequate  storage  must  be  available  for  all  custody  issues as required by AFI 31-101 and AFMAN 91-201. (T-1). 7.10.4.  Munitions Pick-up Procedures. 7.10.4.1.

Supplying Small Arms Ammunition to Units at Deployed Locations. 7.10.7.1.  Supply  small  arms  ammunition  IAW  the  reporting  instructions  and  final destination/line  remarks  on  individual  orders.  A  copy  of  the  individual’s  orders  will  be maintained  with turned-in  and receipt/disposition  of  the  small  arms  is  validated. (T-1).  Process  custody  issues  IAW paragraph 7.10.3 and process SmACC issues IAW paragraph 7.10.2.3.1. issue  documents  until  assets  are the  custody 7.10.7.2.  The supplying unit (e.g., LRS, MUNS, Munitions Flight, SFS) will ensure local written  policy  exists  to  ensure  small  arms  are  returned  to  the  supplying  unit  while maintaining lot number integrity. (T-1).  The supplying unit will use the AF IMT 4331 to document issue of all small arms ammunition to include the following information: 7.10.7.2.1.  Name of issuer, name of receiver; home station, unit, and DSN; deployed station,  unit,  and    DSN;  NSN,  noun,  lot  number,  cartridge  case  markings,  quantity issued,  estimated  departure  date  from  Area  of  Responsibility  (AOR),  receiver signature, and date of issue. (T-2). 7.10.7.2.2.  The  issuing  authority  will  provide  the  receiver  a  copy  of  the  AF  IMT 4331 and maintain the original AF IMT 4331 IAW the Air Force RDS in AFRIMS. (T-2).  The  issuing  authority’s  mailing  address,  FAX  number,  and  organizational  e-mail  address  will  be  clearly  printed  on  the  AF  IMT  4331. (T-2).  The  MASO  will ensure that AF IMT 4331 used for SmACC issues are maintained IAW the Air Force RDS in AFRIMS; refer to Attachment 5. (T-1). 7.10.7.2.3.  The AF IMT 4331 in conjunction with CAS Transaction History Listing (AM903)  will  be  used  to  screen  and  identify  5.56mm  and  9mm  small  arms ammunition  issued  to  ORG/SHP  code  920CC  for  CMRS.  (T-1).    If  restricted  or suspended SmACC is identified, the issuing MASO will make and document attempts to locate and notify individuals/units. (T-1). 7.10.7.3.  Individuals  who  receive  ammunition  using  SmACC  procedures  will  make every attempt to return small arms ammunition to the point of issue upon departure from the AOR. (T-2). checkpoints 7.10.7.4.  The  supplying  unit  commander  works  closely  with  the  base/theater  Personnel Support for Contingency Operations office and NAF to include Munitions Receipt/Turn-in deploying/redeploying personnel.  Munitions  checkpoints  must  be  validated  through  use  of  a  “Stamp”  rather than  initials/signatures  to  ensure  personnel  return  issued  ammunition  prior  to  out-processing the theater. (T-2). in-/out-processing on checklists for 7.11.  Expenditures.  Expenditures  are  processed  to  account  for  and  document  physical consumption of stock record account and custody account munitions.  Expenditures fall into two categories:  Custody Expenditures and Stockpile Expenditures. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   151  7.11.1.  Custody  Account  Expenditures.  The  consuming  organization  or  activity  will provide the MASO with validated and electronic expenditure requests within 2 duty days of use. (T-2). Exception:  ANG  and  AFRC  units  that  do  not  have  full  time  manned  account  custodians  may submit account expenditures within 5 duty days.  Refer to paragraph  7.8 for Custody Account Management procedures. 7.11.1.1.  Custodians will include the following on expenditure requests: 7.11.1.1.1.  Nomenclature. (T-1). 7.11.1.1.2.  NSN. (T-1). 7.11.1.1.3.  Unit of Issue. (T-1). 7.11.1.1.4.  Quantity. (T-1). 7.11.1.1.5.  Document Number. (T-1). 7.11.1.1.6.  Lot,  S/N  (as  applicable),  and  CC.  SRC  I  items  will  include  S/N  on  the expenditure request. (T-1). 7.11.1.1.7.  CAT Code. (T-1). 7.11.1.1.8.  If  applicable,  the  words  “CLASSIFIED  ITEM”  or  “CLASSIFIED NWRM ITEM” (if applicable), in red, bold, capital letters. (T-0). 7.11.1.1.9.  Digital  signature  of  custody  account  custodian  or  organization commander. (T-1). 7.11.1.2.  SOCOM  and  AFCENT  munitions  units  supporting  non-traditional  operations may manage and expend assets from custody account with AFSOC/AFCENT approval. 7.11.1.3.  All  unit  custody  account  custodians  will  maintain  source  documentation  to support  custody  account  auditability  for  all  reported  expenditures  (CATM  Range Records,  Shooting  Class  Rosters,  Ammunition  Issue  Logs,  EOD  Training  Logs,  etc.) IAW the Air Force RDS in AFRIMS. (T-1). 7.11.1.3.1.  Functional communities (Security Forces, EOD, CE, munitions, etc.) shall describe  the  specific  documentation  in  functional  publications  that  shall  be maintained to meet this custody account auditability requirement. (T-1). 7.11.1.3.2.  The  MASO  does  not  maintain  or  file  record/documentation  to  support auditability of custodian and user expenditures. (T-1).  The MASO will maintain the custodian's  expenditure  request,  as  an  accountable  source  document,  to  support custody expenditure transactions processed in CAS. (T-1). 7.11.2.  Stockpile  Expenditures:  Used to process expenditures for assets managed directly from  the  stock  record  account.  This  will  not  be utilized  for custody  managed  assets. (T-1).  Stockpile  expenditures  are  only  used  to  support  aircraft  munitions  and  munitions  managed internally by the MASO and Munitions unit/activity. 7.11.2.1.  Controlling and Processing Stockpile Expenditures:  Control expenditures from the  stock  record  account  through  active  and  continuous  allocation  and  inventory management.  Munitions assets used for peacetime support will not be expended without   152  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 an approved allocation. (T-1).  Units use the Level Reconciliation Listing (AMC12A) and CAS generated reports to manage these allocations. 7.11.2.1.1.  Personnel  performing  munitions  tasks  and  operations  (e.g.,  munitions crews,  weapons  expediters)  shall  process  expenditures  in  CAS  using  automated-, direct-, or remote-input methods outlined in paragraph 7.1.1.3.1. (T-1). 7.11.2.1.2.  Munitions  assets  staged,  assembled,  and  configured  for  delivery/or  shall remain on the stock record account until physically expended. (T-1).  Once physically expended,  these  assets  will  be  expended  in  CAS  against  the  appropriate  CAT  Code and ORG/SHP code. (T-1). 7.11.2.1.3.  After  expenditures  from  the  stock record  account  are  processed  in  CAS, the  MASO  will  validate  that  these  transactions  were  processed  correctly  by comparing the CAS Transaction History Listing, AM903 against the AF IMT 2434, AF  IMT  4331,  and/or  other  documents. (T-1). Discrepancies  will  be researched  and corrected. (T-0). 7.11.2.1.4.  Expenditures for all TMRS tracked assets shall be recorded in TMRS. (T-2). 7.11.2.2.  WRM Munitions Expenditures: to include  munitions  positioned 7.11.2.2.1.  WRM  munitions, in  support  of allocations for CAT Codes B, F, G, M, X, and Z will not be expended in peacetime without  approval. (T-1).  Peacetime  contingency  WRM  expenditures  shall  be approved  by  the  MAJCOM,  or  higher. (T-1).  Peacetime,  non-contingency  WRM expenditure  shall  be  approved  by  AF/A4LW  (ground)  or  AF/A5R-C  (air munitions). (T-1).   7.11.2.2.2.  Physical  assets  are  designated  as  WRM  (or  other  category)  only  after assets are actually expended.  Munitions assets will not be segregated in stock based on the allocated CAT Code/quantity. (T-1). 7.11.2.2.3.  Munitions expended for a valid WRM, combat, or contingency purpose in Categories  F,  G,  T,  or  X  will  be  processed  in  CAS  against  the  ORG/SHP  codes identified  in  the  WRM,  Combat,  or  Contingency  ORG/SHP  Expenditure  Processing Codes table located on the GACP website (HQ USAF/ A4LW Information) link.  (T-1).  These  ORG/SHP  codes  will  be  used  regardless  of  original  allocated  ORG/SHP code, quantity, or CAT Code. (T-1). 7.11.2.2.3.1.  This  ORG/SHP  code  structure  for  WRM,  Combat,  or  Contingency expenditures  for  CAT  Code  F,  G,  T,  and  X  enables  automated  extraction  and reporting of expenditure data by “Operation” from automated systems (e.g., CAS, Global Combat Support System – Air Force (GCSS-AF) Data Services). the  WRM,  Combat,  or 7.11.2.2.3.2.  Additions,  deletions,  or  changes Contingency  ORG/SHP  Expenditure  Processing  Codes  will  be  posted  to  the GACP website by AF/A4LW or GACP. (T-1). to 7.11.2.2.4.  WRM,  combat,  or  contingency  operation  ORG/SHP  codes  need  to  be established in CAS prior to processing any expenditures against them. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   153  7.11.2.2.5.  It is not necessary to load levels for valid WRM, combat, or contingency expenditures.    Use  the  “Level  Bypass”  option  when  expending  against  these ORG/SHP codes. 7.11.2.2.6.  The  GACP  will  update  the  support  data  edits  table  in  CAS  program Manage  System  Edits  (AMA10  )  for  label  name  “LEVEL  BYPASS  ORG  SHOP CODES”.  The  Manage  System  Edits  (AMA10)  screen  only  allows  additions  or deletions.  Any errors require deletion and reloading. 7.11.2.3.  Aircraft  Munitions  Expenditures:    The  Air  Force  goal  is  to  process  aircraft munitions  expenditure  in  CAS  within  one  hour  of  aircraft  recovery.    Except  as  noted otherwise  in  this  publication,  aircraft  expenditures  will  be  processed  as  aircraft  recover throughout the flying day, but NLT between aircraft goes. (T-2). 7.11.2.3.1.  The one hour and NLT between aircraft goes expenditure processing goal does not apply to aircraft gun ammunition and countermeasures.  These expenditures will be processed only after full gun/magazine download and maintenance processing IAW paragraph 7.11.2.3.5. (T-2). 7.11.2.3.2.  The  one-hour  expenditure  processing  goal  may  be  unattainable  if Weapons  Expediters  must  depart  the  flightline  area  to  process  expenditure transactions when infrastructure limits automated-input processing capability (e.g., no wireless  on  flightline).    In  this  case,  munitions  and  weapons  managers  collectively decide which expenditure processing method best serves the mission. 7.11.2.3.3.  Weapons  Expediters:   During  SGO,  Weapons  Expediters  manage munitions  assets  on  the  flightline.  They  execute  flightline  support  and  munitions accountability  processes  through  validation  of  aircraft  load/expenditure  accuracy.  Weapons  expediters  reconcile  munitions/weapons  data,  document  (as  required),  and facilitate  processing  movement  and  expenditure in  CAS  using automated-, direct-, or remote-input methods IAW paragraph 7.1.1.3.1. transactions 7.11.2.3.4.  When  automated  input  is  not  used,  flightline  munitions  activity  and expenditures will be documented on an  AF IMT 2434, or  local form, IAW  AFI  21-101;  or  the  AF  IMT  4331.  (T-2).    All  documentation  will  be  turned  in  to  the Munitions  Control  activity  for  verification  and  MASO  validation  against  the  CAS daily  transaction  history. (T-1).  Route  the  AF  IMT  2434  or  AF  IMT  4331  through the workcenter managing TMRS to update flight hours for TMRS tracked items.  The AF IMT 4331 or AF IMT 2434 may be destroyed after validation. 7.11.2.3.5.  Aircraft  gun  ammunition  and  countermeasure  expenditures  will  not  be processed  using  automated,  direct,  or  remote-input. (T-1).  Aircraft  gun  ammunition and countermeasures will be managed as  full loads  (minus  “kickback” rounds)  until weapons personnel download the gun/magazines and expended rounds are processed by  maintenance  to  validate  actual  expenditures.  (T-2).    After  processing,  the expenditure will be processed in CAS based on the actual count. (T-1).   154  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 Exception:  Weapons  Expediters  supporting  Special  Operations  Forces  (SOF)  and  Search  and Rescue  (SAR)  aircraft  may  process  expenditures  of  gun  ammunition/countermeasures immediately on the flightline if an entire container of ammunition is empty.  Otherwise, manage a  container  as  a  full  load  until  the  gun  is  downloaded  and  remaining  rounds  are  processed  by maintenance.  7.11.2.3.6.  The Structure Expenditure (AM723A) process will not be used to remove assets  from  accountable  record  when  aircraft  depart/deploy  from  home  station  with munitions. (T-1). Refer to paragraph 7.6, Deployed Munitions Management. 7.11.2.3.7.  Processing  Aircraft  Expenditures  using  AIT:    To  support  munitions expenditures  using  the  CMD,  load  the  ORG/SHP  code  and  Munitions  CAT  Code against  a  specific  aircraft  (Container  ID)  data  record.  If  the  ORG/SHP  code  and Munitions CAT Code are not loaded the transaction will error out and be retained in the CAS AIT Conflict Resolution (AMP09A) program. 7.11.2.3.7.1.  If AIT is available on the flightline, but temporarily off-line or out of  wireless  range,  the  CMD  scanners  operate  in  “Batch  Mode”  and  continue  to collect transaction data. in  Batch  Mode,  weapons  expediters  will 7.11.2.3.7.2.  When  operating synchronize  (process  by  gaining  wireless  connectivity  or  CMD  docking)  all “unprocessed”  Batch  Mode  transactions,  prior  to  processing  movements  to/from or expending assets from recovered aircraft. (T-2). Note:  Synchronizing  ensures  that  transactions  are  processed  in  the  correct  chronological sequence, as they occurred. 7.11.3.  Expenditures  of  FMS,  Test,  Training,  and  by  MOA/MOU  Operations  (CAT Code N).  Munitions allocated as CAT Code N MOA/MOU IAW paragraph 9.5.7.2 will be expended against non-WR ORG/SHP codes created for these specific purposes. (T-1). 7.11.4.  End  of  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  Expenditure  Close  Out.  Annually,  in  the  first  week  of September, the MASO will ensure commanders and custodians are notified, in writing or by e-mail, to submit their end of FY expenditures to the Munitions Operations office NLT close of  business on  29  September. (T-1).  All  end  of  FY  expenditures  will  be  processed  in  CAS prior to 2400 hours, Central Standard Time (CST) on 30 September. (T-1).  Expenditures not processed  prior  to  this  cutoff  will  be  processed  against  new  FY  allocations  and  an  OOCR shall be processed IAW paragraph 7.4.2 for the quantity expended beyond the cutoff. (T-1). 7.12.  Turn-Ins.  (T-1).  All  turn-ins  refer  to  assets  being  returned  to  the  stock  record  account.  There  are  five  types  of  turn-ins:    Organizational  Turn-in  (ORG  TIN),  Custody  Turn-in, Expenditure  Turn-in,  Due-in  From  Maintenance  (DIFM)  Turn-in,  and  Found  on  Base  (FOB) Turn-in. 7.12.1.  Processing  Turn-in  Requests.  Users shall coordinate with the Munitions Flight to turn-in  munitions.  (T-2).    Personnel  authorized to  receipt  for  munitions  turn-ins  from  users are designated “in-checkers” and perform in-check on turn-ins of munitions assets. (T-1).  In-check of munitions turn-ins consists of comparing turn-in documents to physical assets, outer container  markings  (identity  &  quantity),  proper  packaging,  and  safety. (T-1).  All  turn-in requests will include the following: AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   155  7.12.1.1.  Nomenclature. (T-1). 7.12.1.2.  NSN. (T-1). 7.12.1.3.  Quantity. (T-1). 7.12.1.4.  Unit of Issue. (T-1). 7.12.1.5.  Lot or S/N. (T-1). 7.12.1.6.  CAT Code (if applicable). (T-1). 7.12.1.7.  CC (If known). (T-1). 7.12.1.8.  Document number of the original issue (if applicable). (T-1). 7.12.1.9.  Reason for turn-in. (T-1). 7.12.1.10.  In-checker signature, printed name, and date. (T-1). 7.12.2.  Organizational Turn-in (ORG TIN).  Process ORG TIN using the CAS FOB Turn-In (AM555A) program. (T-1).  Process ORG TIN as follows: 7.12.2.1.  In  the  Comments  block  enter:  “ORG  TIN”  and  a  brief  description  (e.g., Component  TIN,  Container  TIN,  Static  Display  TIN,  Recovered  Asset  TIN,  or  COTS Receipt). (T-1). 7.12.2.2.  When  “ORG  TIN”  is  annotated  in  the  comments  block,  the  mandatory documents  outlined  in  paragraph  7.14,  Inventory  Adjustment  Transaction  (AM427J) procedures are not required unless it meets the requirements of paragraph 7.14.4.1. (T-1). 7.12.2.3.  Used FOB Turn-In (AM555A) program for turn-in of: (T-1) 7.12.2.3.1.  Assets when the origin is known.  If the origin of assets is not known, use FOB Turn-in procedures in paragraph 7.12.6. (T-1). 7.12.2.3.2.  Components  removed  from  an  AUR  when  replacement  components  are not requisitioned. (T-1). 7.12.2.3.3.  Empty containers. (T-1). 7.12.2.3.4.  SDM. (T-1). 7.12.2.3.5.  Recovered  stock-listed  assets  previously  adjusted  off  accountable  record when a zero-balance exists. (T-1).  If a stock balance exists, refer to IAD procedures in paragraph 7.14. (T-1). 7.12.2.3.6.  Initial receipt of COTS munitions onto the stock record account. (T-1). 7.12.2.4.  ORG  TINs  do  not  require  a  special  inventory  before  processing  an  ORG  TIN FOB transaction. 7.12.2.5.  For  any  recovered  items  that  are  non-stock  listed,  refer  to  procedures  in paragraph 3.12.13. (T-1).   156  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 7.12.3.  Custody Turn-in.  Used for turn-in of assets from custody accounts. 7.12.4.  Expenditure  Turn-in.  Used  for  assets  originally  consumption  issued  during  the current FY, and were not consumed. 7.12.4.1.  This  process  will  not  be  used  to  turn-in  assets  erroneously  expended  from  a custody  account.  (T-1).  Units  must  process  an  RVP  or  inventory  adjustment  to  correct errors. (T-1). 7.12.4.2.  Turn-in  of  assets  originally  consumption  issued  in  a  previous  FY  shall  be picked up using the ORG TIN process. (T-1).  If assets are classified “For Training Use Only”,  items  can  be  reissued  to  custody  accounts  to  fill  authorized  training  allocations. (T-2). 7.12.4.3.  Upon  turn-in  of  SmACC,  lot  integrity  will  be  assessed  and  maintained  as follows: 7.12.4.3.1.  When SmACC is turned in by an individual who was originally issued the small arms ammunition along with the original AF IMT 4331 issue document and all case  markings  match,  then  lot  integrity  is  assumed.  (T-2).  These  assets  may  be inspected,  turned-in  using  Expenditure  Turn-in  procedures,  and  re-issued  for custody/SmACC if otherwise serviceable. 7.12.4.3.2.  Cartridge  case  markings  will  not  be  used  to  establish  the  year  of manufacture of small arms ammunition. (T-1).  Cartridge case markings may be used to  validate  general  accuracy  of  AF  IMT  4331  lot  number  information  for  rounds returned by the individual they were originally issued to. 7.12.4.3.3.  Rounds  received  or  recovered  from  amnesty  programs/boxes  or  if  the ammunition lot number of rounds returned by individuals cannot be validated, utilize FOB TIN procedures IAW paragraph 7.12.6 to pick-up assets in the appropriate CC. (T-1).    These  rounds  may  be  accumulated  for  inspection  and  TIN  processing  once TIN quantities exceed 100 rounds. 7.12.5.  Due-in  From Maintenance  (DIFM) Turn-in.  Used for turn-in of assets originally issued under DIFM control. 7.12.5.1.  Use  ORG  TIN  procedures  for  turn-in  of  assets  that  were  issued  in  a  previous FY and no replacement item is required. (T-1). 7.12.5.2.  Process  the  DIFM  turn-in  using  the  actual  NSN  and  lot  number  of  the  DIFM return  asset  and  the  document  number  the  replacement  DIFM  asset  was  issued  against. (T-1). 7.12.6.  FOB  Turn-in.  Used  to  turn-in  DoD  stock-listed  munitions  where  the  origin  of assets cannot be determined. 7.12.6.1.  For recovered items that are not stock-listed, refer to procedures in paragraph 3.12.13. 7.12.6.2.  The  MASO  reviews  all  FOB  transactions  to  determine  the  need  for  a  Special inventory  before  processing  the  document.  (T-1).  The  MASO  signs  the  document  to indicate a review of Special inventory requirements. (T-1). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   157  7.13.  Munitions Shipments. 7.13.1.  Integrated  Data  Environment/Global  Transportation  Network/Convergence (IGC).  IGC  provides  in-transit  visibility  of  munitions  movements  through  the  Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS). Note:  Personnel with previous Global Transportation Network (GTN) accounts must reapply for an IGC account at the IGC homepage specified in paragraph 1.4.11. 7.13.1.1.  An  interface  exists  between  CAS  and  CMOS  (or  IGC),  however  not  all interfaces  are  functional  (or  may  be  disabled),  therefore,  at a  minimum  the  MASO  will ensure appropriate personnel maintain an IGC account to track shipments. (T-2). 7.13.1.2.  In  the  event  you  do  not  have  Internet  capabilities,  local  policy  shall  be established with your servicing transportation unit to provide access to the data to track shipment status. (T-3). 7.13.2.  Authorization  to  Receipt  for  Munitions.  Before  munitions  and  explosive, including classified items, are released to anyone for movement/shipment, agencies/activities that will accept munitions must provide a written and signed listing of individuals authorized to receipt for the items. (T-1). 7.13.2.1.  The authorization listing will include the name, rank, and security clearance of each authorized individual. (T-1).  Signature specimens will also be provided on the list or  on  an  attached  signature  card  with  printed  name  and  date  of  signature.  (T-1).    The authorization  listing  is  required  regardless  of  digital  signature  capability.  (T-1).    If  the receiving  agency/activity  has  the  capability  to  digitally  sign  and  receipt  for  munitions being received/shipped, then no signature specimen is required on the listing. (T-2). 7.13.2.2.  When  NOSS/TO  11N-45-51  procedures  are  used to  ship/receive classified/nuclear  weapon  TYPE  trainers,  then  signature  specimens  of  receiving DOE/DoD  couriers  are  not  required  on  the  pre-sent/pre-coordinated  ‘Receipt  for Classified  Nuclear Weapons Materiel’ courier letter.

Munitions  activities  will  retain  physical accountability of munitions assets placed in an intransit status until the actual DDO. (T-0). 7.13.4.1.  Storage  activities  shipping  assets  to  satisfy  requisitions  are  responsible  to provide  shipment  status  to  the  appropriate  Source  of  Supply  (e.g.,  GACP)  when required/requested IAW DLM 4000.25, Vol. 2, Supply Standard Procedures, Chapter 4, Requisitioning. (T-0). 7.13.4.2.  When  the  shipping  munitions  activity  selects  assets  for  shipment,  CAS automatically loads them to the CAS Intransit Asset Table.  When the shipping munitions activity updates the DDO, CAS removes the local DoDAAC, location, and structure from the assets. 7.13.4.3.  Ensure  all intransit  shipments temporarily  stored within the MSA  that  did  not originate  from  that  DoDAAC  are  loaded  and  managed  in  CAS  using  the  Non-Accountable (AM101A) program. (T-1). 7.13.4.3.1.  When shipments erroneously DDO’d or dropped off record are scheduled to  depart  station  within  30  calendar  days,  manage  the  assets  on  CAS  Non-Accountable  (AM101A)  program.  (T-1).  When  these  shipment  actually  depart  the installation, clear these assets from the Non-accountable program (AM101A). (T-1). 7.13.4.3.2.  Erroneously  DDO’d  or  dropped  off  record  shipment  assets  will  not  be managed in AM101A beyond 30 calendar days. (T-1).  When shipments erroneously DDO’d  or  dropped  off  record  are  scheduled  to  depart  station  beyond  30  calendar AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   161  days,  the  shipment  will  be  cancelled,  assets  will  be  picked up  onto  the stock  record account, and, if necessary, the shipment will be reprocessed in CAS. (T-0). 7.13.4.3.3.  All  intransit  records  will  be  validated  during  the  weekly  shipment reconciliation. (T-1). 7.13.4.4.  When CAS is not available at the shipping or receiving installation, the MASO keeps  the  servicing  MAJCOM/NAF  and  the  GACP  apprised  of  the  shipment  status  via any expedient and accurate means (e-mail, fax, etc.). 7.13.4.5.  Shipments between Air Force activities: 7.13.4.5.1.  Munitions shipped from one Air Force “FV” DoDAAC to  another “FV” DoDAAC remain in  the  CAS Intransit Asset Table until received by the destination activity.  Refer  to  paragraph  7.13.4.7  for  all  classified  and  sensitive  munitions shipments regardless of origin or destination. 7.13.4.5.2.  Reconcile  and  document  status  of  all  outstanding  shipments,  by  TCN, with the transportation activity. (T-2). 7.13.4.5.3.  Verify  the  DDO  in  CAS  once  assets  physically  depart  installation.  (T-2).  For assets not updated by CMOS, process the DDO action manually in CAS. (T-2). Note:  At installations with aerial ports, the CMOS – CAS interface may have been disabled due to erroneous DDO feeds from CMOS.  In these cases, DDO updates are completed manually. 7.13.4.5.4.  When  assets  are  received  in  CAS  by  the  destination  munitions  activity, assets automatically drop off the CAS Intransit Asset Table and be picked up on the receiving DoDAAC stock record account. 7.13.4.5.5.  Munitions  activities  are  responsible  to  actively  follow-up  by  reviewing and monitoring the CAS intransit assets. (T-2).  If problems are suspected or noted, unit  shippers  and  receivers  will  initiate  communications  (e.g.,  telephone,  e-mail, CRM as appropriate) with the origin/destination, Lead MAJCOM, NAF, or GACP as appropriate to identify and resolve problems. (T-1). 7.13.4.5.6.  In  the  event  the  recipient  does  not  receive  the  material  by  the  RDD,  the recipient  must  follow-up  through  the  transportation  activity/unit  if  the  DDO  is  not greater  than  30  days.  (T-3).    If  the  DDO  is  greater  than  30  days,  the  recipient  must initiate tracer action with transportation unit and/or Source of Supply using the TCN. (T-3).  Follow-up timelines  for  classified  and  sensitive  munitions  are  IAW paragraph 7.13.4.7. 7.13.4.6.  Shipments to Non-Air Force Activities: (T-1).  Munitions shipment records to non-Air  Force  activities  (e.g.,  retail/wholesale  depots,  manufacturer/contract  repair facilities,  other  services/federal  agencies)  will  automatically  “clear”  from  the  CAS Intransit Asset Table 30 days after the DDO is updated in CAS. Note:  Intransit records for classified and sensitive munitions categories identified in paragraph 7.13.4.7  do  not  automatically  clear.    These  records  are  cleared  by  the  GACP  after  receipt  has been validated.   162  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 7.13.4.7.  Classified  and  Sensitive  Munitions  Shipments:  The  loss,  theft,  unlawful disposition,  and/or  recovery  of  Classified  and  Sensitive  munitions  require  investigation IAW  DLM  4000.25-2,  Military  Standard  Transaction  Reporting  and  Accounting Procedures  (MILSTRAP)  Manual. (T-1).    This  requires  a  higher  level  of  oversight  to validate  that  shipment  of  classified  and  sensitive  munitions  are  actually  received  at  the intended  destination  before  clearing  shipments  from  the  CAS  Intransit Asset  Table.  (T-1). 7.13.4.7.1.  Receipt validation applies to the following Classified and Sensitive Item categories: 7.13.4.7.1.1.  CIIC 1 – Very High Risk (SRC I). (T-0). 7.13.4.7.1.2.  CIIC 2 – High Risk (SRC II). (T-0). 7.13.4.7.1.3.  CIIC 5 – Secret (SRC I). (T-0). 7.13.4.7.1.4.  CIIC 6 – Confidential (SRC I). (T-0). 7.13.4.7.1.5.  CIIC 8 – Confidential (SRC II). (T-0). 7.13.4.7.1.6.  CIIC C – Confidential. (T-0). 7.13.4.7.1.7.  CIIC S – Secret. (T-0). 7.13.4.7.1.8.  CIIC T – Top Secret. (T-0). 7.13.4.7.2.  There are two methods to accomplish receipt validation depending on the origin/destination  of  the  shipment.    Receipt  at  an  Air  Force  DoDAAC  using  the original CAS TCN (T-1) or the GACP centrally validates shipment receipt and closes the CAS Intransit record. 7.13.4.7.2.1.  Classified  and  Sensitive  Shipments  between  Air  Force  DoDAACs:  MASOs at Air Force installations receiving classified or sensitive munitions from other  Air  Force installations will receipt assets in  CAS following normal  receipt procedures  to  clear  intransit  records  from  the  CAS  Intransit  Asset  Table  (T-1).  Additionally, the MASO will: 7.13.4.7.2.1.1.  Ensure  all  classified  and  sensitive  munitions  assets  are properly  receipted  using  the  CAS  TCN. (T-1).  Receipt  in  CAS  constitutes proper  “validation”  only  when  the  receipt  is  processed  using  the  CAS  TCN and  the  shipment  is  cleared  from  the  CAS  Intransit  Asset  Table.  Personnel receiving these classified and sensitive assets are responsible to the MASO to validate the shipment was cleared from the CAS Intransit Asset Table. 7.13.4.7.2.1.2.  Receive  these  assets  using  a  local  TCN  if  the  CAS  TCN cannot  be  used,  or  the  CAS  Intransit  Asset  Table  did  not  properly  clear  the shipment. (T-1). Notify the GACP through the CRM and report the following information: 7.13.4.7.2.1.2.1.  Reason CAS TCN could not be used. (T-1). 7.13.4.7.2.1.2.2.  Original CAS TCN (if any). (T-1). 7.13.4.7.2.1.2.3.  Local TCN used to receipt assets. (T-1). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   163  7.13.4.7.2.1.2.4.  NSN. (T-1). 7.13.4.7.2.1.2.5.  Quantity. (T-1). 7.13.4.7.2.1.2.6.  Full  Name,  Organization,  and  DSN  of  personnel processing receipt in CAS. (T-1). 7.13.4.7.2.1.3.  Once  this  data  is  received,  the  GACP  will  close  the  intransit record. 7.13.4.7.2.2.  Classified  and  Sensitive  Shipments  to  Non-Air  Force  Activities:  The GACP will develop internal processes to validate receipt of  assets and clear the CAS Intransit Asset Table records. 7.13.4.7.2.2.1.  GACP  validation  of  classified  and  sensitive  munitions shipments requires that each receiver acknowledge verbally, in writing, via e-mail  (digital  signature),  or  through  other  automated  means  (CAS,  other application) that the shipped TCN, NSN, and quantity was actually received, and the date assets were received. 7.13.4.7.2.2.2.  Validation  will  be  performed  on  all  classified  and  sensitive shipments that  exceed the Estimated Delivery Date (EDD) or  go beyond 30-days from the DDO. (T-1). 7.13.5.  PACER AMMO Project Codes.  (T-1).  PACER AMMO is the Air Force program to  monitor  and  track  worldwide  munitions  transportation  costs  using  AFMC  managed Second  Destination  Transportation  (SDT)  funds  IAW  paragraph  15.6.  (T-1).  Assign  the appropriate  PACER  AMMO  project  code  and  corresponding  Transportation  Account  Code (TAC) IAW Table 7.4. (T-1). 7.13.6.  PACER  AMMO  Transportation  Account  Codes  (TAC).  The  shipping  activity will  annotate  (write)  the  appropriate  TAC  on  the  shipping  document  (e.g.,  1348-1A  or  DD 1149) delivered to the local transportation activity. (T-1).  TACs will be applied as follows: 7.13.6.1.  F8RT.  Used for movement of missiles and associated components governed by the TAMP. (T-1). 7.13.6.2.  F8UT.  Used  for  movement  of  conventional  and  precision  guided  munitions governed by the DLAR. (T-1). 7.13.6.3.  F8PT.  Used for movement of all munitions to support warfighter contingency operations.    Must  be  used  in  conjunction  with  an  appropriate  contingency  project  code (e.g., 3XX, 9XX). (T-1). 7.13.6.4.  Non-DLAR/TAMP Shipments:  For munitions shipments not governed by the DLAR  or  TAMP,  the  activity  directing  or  requesting  the  shipment  (e.g.,  MAJCOM, NAF, unit) will provide the shipping activity with an appropriate TAC or identify/direct the  source  of  funding  to  be  used  (e.g.,  MAJCOM,  shipping  unit)  within  their  authority and  funding  line  of  accounting.  (T-1).    The  shipping  activity  will  annotate  (write)  the provided TAC on the shipping document. (T-1). Note:  Unless otherwise stated, the GACP is not the directing/requesting activity for shipments not covered by the TAMP/DLAR.   164  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 7.13.7.  ANG  Munitions  Transportation.  The  shipping  activity  will  annotate  (write)  the appropriate  TAC  on  the  shipping  document  (e.g.,  1348-1A  or  DD  1149)  delivered  to  the local  transportation  activity.  (T-1).  ANG  munitions  requisitions  and  shipments  related  to ANG ADRs, maintenance returns, and CAD/PAD are not supported by the PACER AMMO Program. 7.13.7.1.

When using project code 737, refer to AFI 24-203 for the proper use of TAC F8E0. (T-1). 10.  Maximize the use of ISO container space. (T-3).  Defer partial loaded ISO containers to a future retrograde.  Plan and coordinate shipment of an ISO load to mixed destinations with the GACP. (T-2). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   167  7.13.8.  ISO Container Shipments. 7.13.8.1.  Prior-to-use  inspections  will  be  performed  before  loading  munitions  for shipment  and  will  consist  of  a  visual  interior  and  exterior  examination  for  obvious defects. (T-0). 7.13.8.2.  Shipments  of  munitions  using  ISO  containers  that  originate  from  munitions activities will attach CAS shipping documents and the Mass Shipment Report (AMI25R) to  the  inside  of  a  door  on  each  container.  (T-1).    Attach  the  original-signed  DA  Form 2404 to the inside of a door on each container and maintain a copy of the DA Form 2404 IAW DTR 4500.9-R. (T-0). 7.13.8.3.  AIT capable units will label container and contents as required. (T-0).  Labels will be placed on the door near the consolidated data plate. (T-0). 7.13.8.4.  All applicable DOT markings will be properly affixed. (T-0). 7.13.8.5.  RFID tags are detached from the outer container surface and reattached to the inside  of  the  container  door  or  consolidated  into  a  central  location  immediately  upon removal  of  assets.  (T-1).    Reverse  the  battery  to  deactivate  the  tag  prior  to  placing  it inside the  container.  (T-1).    This  prevents  the  container  from  being  tracked  as  a  loaded container in the transportation system. 7.13.8.6.  ISO  containers  used  in  MASS  munitions  shipment  procedures,  prepared  for shipment  of  munitions,  or  used  for  storage  of  munitions  shall  must  be  loaded  as  “ISO” type  containers  using  CnC  management  procedures  of  Container  Maintenance (AM106A) program IAW paragraph 7.1.5. (T-1). 7.13.9.  FMS Shipments. 7.13.9.1.  When  assets  are  authorized  for  release  IAW  paragraph  9.5  as  an  approved FMS  case  all  shipping  documents  will  be  annotated  with  "Released  IAW  FMS-CASE XXXX” and attach copies of authorizing correspondence. (T-1). 7.13.9.2.  When  an  existing  Acquisition  Cross-Servicing  Agreement  (ACSA)  authorizes the release of FMS assets, and the MAJCOM/NAF A4 (or equivalent) has approved the release,  annotate  all  documents  with  “Released  IAW  ACSA”  and  attach  copies  of authorizing correspondence to the shipping documents. (T-1). 7.13.10.  Cancelled  Shipments.  When a shipment is processed in CAS but does not depart the  installation  (e.g.,  DDO  is  not  updated),  the  shipment  can  be  cancelled  if  necessary.  (T-2).  An  RVP  for  the  shipment  will  not  be  processed  in  CAS. (T-1).  Personnel  process  a shipment  cancellation  IAW  the  Air  Force  Munitions  Accountability  Procedures  Guide.  (T-2).  The document may be cleared from the AME01A screen in CAS without filing. 7.13.11.  Shipping Munitions with RAM.  IAW AFI 40-201, Munitions Supervision or the MASO  shall  ensure  shipments  of  munitions  with  RAM  (e.g.,  30MM  API  with  DU)  are coordinated with the gaining unit's commander and approved by the IRSO before shipments occur. (T-1). 7.13.11.1.  DoD 6055.09-M and AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards will not be violated to meet AFI 40-201 storage, transportation, or disposal requirements.

(T-0). 7.13.11.3.  Disposition of explosive RAM materiel shall be IAW Chapter 3 of this AFI. (T-0). 7.14.  Inventory  Adjustment  Transaction  (AM427J)  Procedures.  When  custody  account  or stock  record  account  discrepancies  are  discovered  that  could  not  be  reconciled,  an  Inventory Adjustment  must  be  processed.  (T-0).  Manual  Record  Processing  (AMC05A)  procedures  will not be used in lieu of Inventory Adjustment procedures without specific direction/authority. (T-0). Process an Inventory Adjustment using the following procedures: 7.14.1.  Causative Research.  Causative research is required on any inventory discrepancies (gains or losses) found. (T-0).  Additionally, for CAS-managed NWRM assets: 7.14.1.1.  All  inventory  adjustments  to  accountable  records  as  a  result  of  causative research  must  have  a  Report  of  Survey  (ROS) accomplished  IAW  paragraph  7.15  and be approved at the Flag Officer/Senior Executive Service (SES) level regardless of dollar value. (T-1). 7.14.1.2.  Unresolved  Discrepancies:  The  MASO  shall  forward  all  unresolved  CAS-managed  NWRM  inventory  discrepancies  (gain  or  loss)  to  the  AFSC  NWRM Transaction Control Cell (NTCC) for IM approval prior to adjustment. (T-1).   7.14.1.2.1.  Research  must  be  completed  within  30  calendar  days  of  the  inventory close-out  date.  (T-1).  Causative  research  shall  be  included  with  the  NWRM discrepancy  template  (AFI  20-110),  ROS  if  required  IAW  paragraph  7.15,  and  the CAS IAD package.  (T-1).  7.14.1.2.2.  The MASO shall ensure all unresolved NWRM discrepancies are reported IAW  DoDM  5100.76,  Enclosure  11,  Reports,  Investigative  Aids,  and  Disposition  of Records, and AFI 31-101. (T-1). 7.14.1.3.  Resolved  Discrepancies  (e.g.,  proof  of  cause  is  clearly  evident):    When  a NWRM  discrepancy  is  resolved  through  positive  proof  of  administrative,  posting,  or paperwork  errors  not  resulting  in  actual  loss  of  property,  the  MASO  will  develop  and sign  a  discrepancy  investigation  statement  indicating  the  discrepancy  does  not  merit  a ROS, explain the cause of the discrepancy, and appropriate correction actions. (T-1). 7.14.2.  Theft, Negligence, or Inappropriate Use.  No AA&E loss shall be attributed to an accountability or inventory discrepancy if determined through investigation that the loss was the  result  of  theft,  negligence,  or  inappropriate  use.  (T-0).  Any  adjustment  involving  an actual loss must be evaluated against the reporting criteria of DoDM 5100.76. (T-0). 7.14.3.  Investigating and Researching Shortage Discrepancies.  When discrepancies exist that  involve  imbalances  between  actual  on-hand  property  and  accountable  records,  the custodian,  unit  commanders,  Munitions  Operations  element,  and  the  MASO  must  conduct thorough research to determine the source of the discrepancy (excess/shortage), to include  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   169  inventories of other custody accounts with items issued.  (T-0).  Investigation and causative research  must  precede  any  IAD  action  that  is  not  proved  to  be  an  administrative  posting error. (T-0). 7.14.4.  Investigating  and  Researching  Overage  Discrepancies.  When  a  discrepancy involves  finding  more  assets  on  stock  than  are  on  accountable  records,  conduct  thorough research  to  determine  the  cause  of  the  discrepancy.  (T-0).    Before  processing  the  IAD package,  consider  the  following  conditions  to  determine  the  proper  process  for  the  IAD package: 7.14.4.1.  Assets adjusted from accountable records which are later recovered, but have a zero balance in base stock, will be picked up on record using ORG TIN procedures IAW paragraph  7.12.2. (T-1).  In  this  case,  ensure  mandatory  documents  outlined  in paragraph 7.14.5 and the Transaction History Listing (AM903) showing the ORG TIN to correct the account balance are added to the original IAD package. (T-1). 7.14.4.2.  Assets discovered that are not on record, have an unknown origin, and have a zero balance in base stock, will be picked up on record using FOB turn-in criteria listed in  paragraph  7.12.6.  (T-1).  In  this  case,  the  mandatory  documents  outlined  in paragraph 7.14.5 must be included in the IAD package, as well as a Transaction History Listing  (AM903)  showing  that  the  FOB  turn-in  was  processed  to  correct  the  account balance. (T-1).  For NWRM, an ROS is also mandatory IAW paragraph 7.15.1.1. (T-1). 7.14.4.3.  If  discrepancy  items  do  not  meet  either  of  the  above  criteria,  an  IAD  will  be processed to place items on record. (T-1).  Whether processing an ORG TIN, FOB turn-in,  or  an  IAD  to  place  items  onto  accountable  record  must  be  supported  in  the  same manner required to support adjustment of assets off of accountable record. (T-1). 7.14.5.  The Inventory Adjustment Document (IAD) Package.  The Munitions Operations element  notifies  the  MASO  of  the  discrepancy  and  prepares  the  IAD  package (T-1)  which includes: Note:  Movements  processed  using  the  CAS  Movement  Process  (AM104A)  to  correct  asset locations when no overall balance discrepancy exists does not require an IAD package. 7.14.5.1.  A memorandum endorsed by the MASO and Munitions Supervision providing a  concise  description  of  the  IAD  package.  (T-1).  EXAMPLE:    The  description  could indicate  that  an  inventory  was  performed  (if  necessary),  research  was  conducted,  and  a statement describing any evidence found indicating that a loss resulted from negligence, fraud, or theft. 7.14.5.2.  IAD  Supporting  Documentation:  Attach  the  following  documents  to  the memorandum: 7.14.5.2.1.  CAS  Inventory  Adjustment  Transaction  (AM427J)  or  CAS  Transaction History (AM903) record as applicable IAW paragraphs 7.14.4.1 and 7.14.4.2. (T-1). Note:  When applicable, the AM427J is processed and attached after IAD package approval.  7.14.5.2.2.  CAS  Inventory  Count  Listing  (AM427G)  (e.g.,  Inventory  Count  Sheets for all types of inventories.) (T-1).   170  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 7.14.5.2.3.  Memorandum  from  MASO  (stock),  Commander  (custody),  or  a  CAS DR/SAN  from  the  CAS  PMO  (CAS  issue/problem  )  that  describes  the  corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence. (T-1). 7.14.5.2.4.  If applicable, include the following documents in the IAD package: 7.14.5.2.4.1.  DD  Form  200,  Financial  Liability  Investigation  of  Property  Loss. (T-1). 7.14.5.2.4.2.  AFTO  Form  102,  Munitions  Inspection  Document,  or  signed accountable document. (T-1). 7.14.5.2.4.3.  DD Form 114, Military Pay Order. (T-1). 7.14.5.2.4.4.  DD Form 362, Statement of Charges/Cash Collection Voucher.  (T-1). 7.14.5.2.4.5.  DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher. (T-1). 7.14.5.2.4.6.  DD Form 361, Transportation Discrepancy Report (TDR). (T-1). 7.14.5.2.4.7.  DD Form 1348-1A. (T-1). 7.14.5.2.4.8.  SF 364, Report of Discrepancy (ROD), or WebSDR equivalent. (T-1). 7.14.5.2.4.9.  A  discrepancy  investigation  statement  with  copies  of  erroneous documents which could not be processed as an RVP. (T-1). 7.14.5.2.4.10.  Aircraft  mishap  report  or  a  memorandum  signed  by  the  MXG  or OG commander as authority for relief. (T-1). 7.14.5.2.4.11.  AF  IMT  1168,  Statement  of  Suspect/Witness/Complaint,  (when  a loss is reportable IAW DoDM 5100.76). (T-1). 7.14.5.2.4.12.  When an ROS is not otherwise required, a memorandum from the commander  (or  equivalent)  authorizing  relief  of  accountability  for  adjustments that result in losses (stock or custody account). (T-1). 7.14.6.  IAD Package Review.  Munitions Operations personnel brief the MASO on the IAD package.  (T-2).  The  MASO  ensures  the  IAD  package  includes  sufficient  justification,  and forwards  the  IAD  package  to  the  MUNS  Superintendent  or  Munitions  Flight  Chief/Flight Commander. (T-2). 7.14.6.1.  The  MUNS  Superintendent  or  Munitions  Flight  Chief/Flight  Commander reviews  and  evaluates  the  IAD  package  to  determine  if  flight  processes  and  operating instructions the  MUNS Superintendent  or  Munitions  Flight  Chief/Flight  Commander  initials  the  IAD  package and forwards back to the MASO. (T-2). (T-2). After  concerns  are resolved, require revision. 7.14.6.2.  The NCOIC of Munitions Operations (or equivalent) prepares the IAD package for  MASO  approval  or  prepares  the  IAD  package  for  MASO  certification  and  approval by the MASO appointing authority (T-2) as follows: 7.14.6.2.1.  An IAD that requires an ROS for relief of accountability will be certified by the MASO and approved by the MASO appointing authority. (T-1). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   171  7.14.6.2.2.  An IAD that does not require an ROS, will be certified by the NCOIC of Munitions  Operations  (or  equivalent)  and  approved  by  the  MASO.  (T-2).    The MASO  will  not  delegate  authority  to  approve  inventory  adjustments.  (T-1).  If  the MASO  is  not  available,  the  MASO  appointing  authority  will  approve  adjustments when an ROS is not required. (T-1). 7.14.7.  IAD  Package  Approval.  Depending  on  the  IAD  situation,  the  MASO  or  MASO appointing authority approves the IAD package (T-1) indicating they: 7.14.7.1.  Are aware of the discrepancies reflected in the IAD package. (T-1). 7.14.7.2.  Certify no evidence of neglect, theft or fraud exists. (T-1). 7.14.7.3.  Certify  no  individual  violated  property  responsibility  and  general  principles. (T-1). 7.14.7.4.  Approval  of  actions  taken  to  resolve  the  discrepancy  and  prevent  recurrence. (T-1). 7.14.7.5.  Concur with and approve the IAD package. (T-1).   7.14.7.5.1.  If the MASO appointing authority does not approve the IAD package, the MASO  will  ensure  additional  research/actions  are  taken  to  mitigate  the  concerns  to obtain approval. (T-1). 7.14.7.5.2.  Obtain written approval from the MASO or MASO appointing authority (as applicable) prior to processing an Inventory Adjustment Transaction (AM427J) in CAS. (T-1). 7.14.7.5.3.  After  the  IAD  package  is  approved,  process  the  Inventory  Adjustment Transaction  (AM427J)  in  CAS  and  attach  a  copy  of  the  approval  and  Inventory Adjustment document to the IAD package. (T-1). 7.14.7.5.4.  At ANG bases/units, forward all approved IAD packages to the USP&FO or Assistant USP&FO for signature. (T-1). 7.14.8.  IAD Package Filing.  Electronically file the final IAD package IAW Attachment 5. (T-1). 7.15.  Reports of Survey (ROS) Procedures.  Refer to AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air  Force  Property, AFMAN  23-122, Materiel  Management  Procedures,  AFI  20-110,  and  this instruction for ROS processing format, procedures, timelines, and approval levels.  Once an IAD is processed and an inventory is closed in CAS, the ROS and Inventory Adjustment Package may remain open pending final approval of the ROS.  Additionally: 7.15.1.  An ROS is required IAW AFMAN 23-220 for all adjustments to accountable records resulting  in  a  loss  when  causative  research  is  unable  to  resolve  the  discrepancy.  (T-1).  Additionally, for CAS-managed NWRM: 7.15.1.1.  The MASO shall initiate an ROS within 24 hours IAW AFMAN 23-122 for all adjustments to accountable records resulting in a gain or loss when causative research is unable to explain the cause of the discrepancy. (T-1). 7.15.1.2.  Refer to AFI 20-110 for discrepancy reporting requirements.   172  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 7.15.2.  Mandatory ROS Criteria.  Whether or not a loss meets ROS criteria, an ROS must be completed if negligence, willful misconduct or deliberate unauthorized use of munitions is suspected or when the loss involves the following CIICs: 7.15.2.1.  CIIC 1 – Very High Risk (SRC I). (T-0). 7.15.2.2.  CIIC 5 – Secret (SRC I). (T-0). 7.15.2.3.  CIIC 6 – Confidential (SRC I). (T-0). 7.15.2.4.  CIIC 2 – High Risk (SRC II). (T-0). 7.15.2.5.  CIIC 8 – Confidential (SRC II). (T-0). 7.15.2.6.  CIIC T – Top Secret (SRC II). (T-0). 7.15.2.7.  CIIC S – Secret (SRC III). (T-0). 7.15.2.8.  CIIC C – Confidential (SRC IV). (T-0). 7.15.2.9.  In  addition  to  the  mandatory  ROS  criteria above,  you  must  submit  a  ROS  for all  adjustments  to  balances  of  stock  and  custody  account  assets  (T-1)  unless  the adjustment meets one of the following conditions: 7.15.2.9.1.  Stock  Record  Account  Assets:    One-time  loss  of  less  than  200  items whose total value is $1,000 or less; and all unresolved NWRM discrepancies. (T-1). 7.15.2.9.2.  Custody Accounts:  One-time loss of CIIC 3 (moderate risk) munitions of 20  or  fewer  items  whose  total-  value  is  $200  or  less;  and  all  unresolved  NWRM discrepancies. (T-1). 7.15.2.9.3.  Custody  Accounts:  One-time  loss  of  a  CIIC  4  and  7  (low  risk)  or  U (unclassified) munitions of 200 or fewer items whose total value is $250 or less. (T-1). 7.15.3.  One-Time  Losses.  As  used  in  the  instances  above,  a  “one-time  loss”  means  each incident will be treated (reported and resolved) individually. For example, months or weeks of losses  cannot  be consolidated and justified  them under a single document.  On the other hand, a “one-time loss” does not mean that you will automatically initiate a ROS the second time an account loses munitions.  Commanders and munitions managers must evaluate each incident/loss  within  the  overall  context  of  asset  accountability. (T-3).  A  pattern  of irresponsibility  or  lack  of  adequate  inventory  controls  is  grounds  for  either  freezing  the custody account or initiating a ROS. (T-1). 7.15.4.  Small  arms  Ammunition  Combat  Consumption  (SmACC)  Issues.  An  IAD  or ROS is not required for SmACC issues when processed IAW  paragraph  7.10.2.3.1.  These assets  are  considered  “consumed”  when  issued.  If  assets  are  subsequently  returned  process an appropriate TIN (e.g., FOB) IAW paragraph 7.12. (T-1). 7.15.5.  Combat  Losses/Aircraft  Accidents.  An  ROS  will  not  be  submitted  for  losses resulting from aircraft accidents and property lost during combat operations. (T-1).  Use the aircraft  mishap  report  or  a  memorandum  signed  by  the  OG  or  MXG  commander  (or equivalent)  as  authority  for  inventory  adjustment.  (T-1).    A  copy  of  the  report  or memorandum will be filed with the inventory adjustment document. (T-1). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   173  7.15.6.  Commander  Discretion.  Except  for  mandatory  ROS  requirements,  commanders may elect to process an ROS regardless of required criteria or allow individuals to pay for a loss in lieu of a ROS. 7.15.6.1.  The costs of processing an ROS for small dollar losses may exceed any amount recovered.  However, because of the sensitivity of munitions items, emphasis is placed on accountability rather than economy or efficiency. in  Lieu  of  ROS:  IAW  AFMAN  23-220, the  organizational 7.15.6.2.  Payment commander of the account may allow the responsible individual to pay for the loss in lieu of a ROS.  In this case, the commander will provide the MASO with one of the financial forms  listed  in  paragraph  7.14.5.2.4  to  support  the  inventory  adjustment.  (T-2).  This does not relieve the commander from evaluating the account and establishing procedures to prevent future losses. (T-1). 7.15.7.  Use of the ROS.  The completed ROS is used to substantiate adjustment of the stock record  account  balance,  to  recommend  corrective  action,  and  to  determine  the  financial responsibility of the accountable officer or any other person involved in the discrepancy. (T-1). 7.15.7.1.  Once  an  ROS  number  has  been  assigned,  the  certifying  official  (MASO)  and appointing  authority  (MASO  Appointment  Authority)  are  authorized  to  sign  the incomplete  inventory  adjustment  package.  (T-1).    This  provides  written  approval  to process the inventory adjustment and close out the inventory in CAS. (T-1). 7.15.7.2.  Whether  or  not  an  ROS  is  required,  the  inventory  adjustment  records  must clearly  identify  and  include  all  information  relating  to  the  stockpile  discrepancy  and support the adjustment as a “stand alone” package. (T-1).  This package will complete the audit trail through documents identified in  paragraph  7.12.1.2 to support the inventory adjustment. (T-1). 7.15.8.  Damage  and/or  Destruction:  The  ROS  and  IAD  requirements  described  above apply  to  munitions  on  the  stock  record  account  or  custody  accounts  which  are  damaged  or destroyed  for  reasons  other  than  fair  wear  and  tear,  authorized  expenditure,  aircraft  loss, installation, or disposition.  The accountable officer or account custodian is liable for damage or destruction until relieved of accountability. (T-1). 7.16.  Test/Contract Munitions Management. 7.16.1.  General  Guidance.  Munitions  assets  received  in  support  of  Research  and Development  (R&D)  tests,  to  include  non-Air  Force  owned  munitions  assets,  may  be managed  on  the  stock  record  account,  issued,  and  controlled  by  procedures  in  this AFI.  Accountability, safety, and security of DoD owned and non-DoD owned R&D assets in the physical possession of Air Force activities are enhanced by management in Accountable CAS.    Units  supporting  RDT&E  activities  with  non-DoD  or  foreign  munitions  and explosives will ensure storage is approved IAW AFMAN 91-201 and/or authorized/excepted IAW  AFI  32-9003,  Granting  Temporary  Use  of  Air  Force  Real  Property.  (T-1).  If  these publications do not provide approval or exception, all requests to store non-DoD explosives will be forwarded to the appropriate waiver authority for consideration. (T-1).   174  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 7.16.1.1.  AFMC/A4M  will  serve  as the accountability  of  Laboratory  Developed  Explosive  test  samples.  AFMC/A4M  will develop  and  coordinate  procedures  supporting  96th  Test  Group  test  operations  with  the host  unit  Maintenance  Group  commander  (or  equivalent)  and  the  host  MAJCOM munitions staff. the  guidance  approval  authority  for 7.16.1.2.  When  a  SPO  and/or  Responsible  Test  Officer  (RTO)  acquires  RDT&E munitions  assets  outside  of  the  normal  munitions  procurement,  requisitioning,  and allocation  process/channels  through  program  baseline  funding  or  any  other  means,  they become the owner of the RDT&E munitions assets.  When in the possession of Air Force activities,  manage  assets  procured  outside  of  normal  channels  in  CAS  IAW  paragraph 5.2.6.1. 7.16.1.2.1.  The owning SPO and/or Responsible Test Officer (RTO) must coordinate with  the  owning  MAJCOM  munitions  staff  and  local  MASO,  prior  to  shipping SPO/RTO owned assets to the munitions unit.  This coordination is required to ensure proper munitions management and effective munitions support. 7.16.1.2.2.  When properly coordinated, munitions  received by the munitions unit  in support  of  RDT&E  will  be  picked  up  on  the  stock  record  account  in  CAS  within  5 duty  days  after  receipt.

AFMC/A4MW  is  the  focal  point  for  managing  assignment  of,  adding,  removing,  or changing Air Force munitions DoDAACs IAW paragraph 9.1.4. 9.1.2.  An  installation  may  maintain  more  than  one  conventional  munitions  account  when separate  storage  areas/facilities  exist  on  the  same  installation  (i.e.,  War  Reserve  Stock  for Allies).  Requests for additional DoDAACs indicate why it is in the best interest of the Air Force. 9.1.3.  ANG and AFR units may establish a DoDAAC at any installation where the ANG or AFR maintains an active munitions mission. 9.1.3.1.  When operating as a tenant organization, and a separate DoDAAC is not already established,  ANG  and  AFR  units  shall  advise  the  host  unit  of  the  intent  to  establish  a separate DoDAAC prior to the submission of the DoDAAC request. (T-2). 9.1.3.2.  When  establishing  a  separate  DoDAAC,  the  ANG  and  AFR  units  must  work with the host installation to review and revise any existing host-tenant agreements. (T-2). 9.1.3.3.  Munitions  assets  managed  on  separate  ANG,  AFR,  or  RegAF  DoDAACs  may be stored in the same storage areas/facilities,  provided assets are clearly segregated and Access Control and Movement Control procedures are established in local OIs. 9.1.4.  Establishing  a  DoDAAC.  Lead  MAJCOMs,  ARC,  and  NAFs  will  request establishment, change, or deletion of a DoDAAC IAW AFI 24-230, Maintaining Air Force DoD Activity Address Codes (DoDAAC). 9.1.4.1.  Submit  requests  on-line  through  the  DoDAAC  Web  Management  System specified in paragraph  1.4.9.  (T-1).  Select “Request DoDAAC”, “Change DoDAAC”, or “Delete DoDAAC” (as applicable). 9.1.4.2.  Maintain  accuracy  of  DoDAAC  information  by  updating  CAS  or  other applicable systems and coordinating changes with the DoDAAC monitor identified in the DoDAAC  Web  Management  System.   After  DoDAAC  has  been established/changed/deleted,  submit  addition/change/deletion  information  to  the  CAS PMO. (T-2). (T-2). 9.1.4.3.  If a location is controlled or classified, classify the request appropriately. (T-1).  Controlled addresses are published with “controlled” as the clear text address. (T-2).  The Lead  MAJCOM,  ARC,  and  NAFs  will  maintain  a  classified  list  of  their  controlled DoDAACs  and  provide  this  listing  to  AF/A4LW,  AF/A5R-C,  and  the  GACP  whenever updates are accomplished. (T-2). 9.2.  Munitions Reports. 9.2.1.  CAS is the Air Force’s munitions accounting and reporting system and the source for reporting munitions asset data.   204  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 9.2.2.  Manual  reporting  of  munitions  data  in  any  format  is  discouraged.    CAS  provides worldwide visibility of Air Force munitions assets and shall be used at every level. 9.2.3.  AF/A5R-C  provides  the  priority  build  sequence  to  the  GACP.    This  build  sequence will be the basis for prioritizing worldwide  and theater level CR munitions data in CAS. 9.2.4.  Theater  planners,  MAJCOMs,  NAFs,  and  units  develop  tailored  and  unique  build sequences for prioritizing CR munitions data to facilitate combat planning and forecasting. 9.3.  CAS-managed Material. 9.3.1.  Items  meeting  the  definition  of  AFPD  21-2,  Munitions  and  AFI  21-200  will  be managed  using  CAS  for  the  purpose  of  Air  Force  accountability,  reporting,  requisitioning, transportation, inventory control, and maintaining related IDR. (T-1). 9.3.1.1.  Items  will  not  be  managed  in  CAS  or  by  the  MASO  for  local  operational  or functional convenience. (T-1). 9.3.1.2.  If there is a question whether an item is managed in CAS, contact the GACP via the CRM. 9.3.1.3.  AF/A4LW makes final determinations on non-explosive and inert items, or may designate  other items/assets  to  be  managed in  CAS  to  meet operational or  supply  chain requirements. 9.3.2.  Any item considered for CAS management by an IM or system manager must obtain approval by the appropriate functional manager below: 9.3.2.1.  AF/A4LW  for  air-munitions,  strategic  missile  components,  NWRM,  associated munitions/ explosive assets, and specific designated equipment items. 9.3.2.2.  The AFSFC/SFXW for ground munitions. 9.3.2.3.  The AFCEC/CXD for explosive demolition materials. 9.3.3.  The FSC and stock number of an item in themselves do not determine the system of supply management (i.e., CAS or SBSS) or whether an item is a munitions asset.  End item usage,  hazard  characteristics,  maintenance  characteristics,  security/sensitivity,  supply  chain, and source of supply are the primary considerations. 9.3.4.  Annually, 30 calendar days prior to the end of year stockpile reconciliation closeout, the  GACP  will  access  the  Air  Force  Supply  Central  Data  Base  (AFSCDB)  Discoverer application  to  perform  query  operations  from  the  legacy  SBSS  to  determine  if  munitions managed assets are on Air Force Base Supply records. Note:  Discoverer applications will be de-commissioned in the future and replaced by LIMS-EV or Ad Hoc capabilities. 9.3.4.1.  To  gain  access  to  AFSCDB,  the  GACP  submits  a  DD  Form  2875  to  the  Hill AFB LRS activity (75 LRS/LGRMLM). 9.3.4.2.  If munitions assets are identified or suspected to be on SBSS records, notify the appropriate  MASO  to  take  appropriate  action  with  base  supply  to  research  these  assets and transfer assets from the FB to FV account. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   205  9.3.5.  Annually, 30 calendar days prior to the end of year stockpile reconciliation closeout, the  GACP  will  perform  query  operations  in  CAS/AMST  to  determine  if  supply  managed assets  are  on  Air  Force  munitions  accountable  records.    If  supply  assets  are  identified  or suspected  to  be  on  munitions  accountable  records,  the  GACP  will  notify  the  applicable MASO to take appropriate action with base supply to research these assets and transfer assets from the FV to FB account. 9.4.  Munitions  Inter-Service  Release  Procedures.  MAJCOMs  and  units  will  not  release  Air Force munitions to agencies outside the Air Force without approval. (T-1). 9.4.1.  Approval will be obtained from AF/A5R-C for release of air munitions. (T-1). 9.4.2.  Approval will be obtained from AF/A4LW for release of ground munitions. (T-1). 9.4.3.  Approval  will  be  obtained  from  AFSOC/A4  for  release  of  SOF  unique  Major  Force Program  (MFP)-11  air  and  ground  munitions  to  agencies  outside  the  Air  Force  or  non-AFSOC Air Force units.

FMS  Case  Managers  shall  include  shipment  and  disposition  costs for  FMS  munitions  in  the  cost  and reimbursement  structures,  process,  and  agreements  with FMS customers. 9.5.5.  The Deputy Chief of  Staff  for Installations, Logistics, and Mission  Support  (AF/A4) assesses  the  impact  of  security  assistance  requirements  on  logistics  support  of  Air  Force assets.  AF/A4 coordinates on documents transferring these assets to customers. 9.5.6.  AF/A4LW  provides  action  officer  review  of  all  FMS  cases  to  sell,  lease,  or  loan munitions,  missiles,  and  ammunition  articles  or  munitions  related  services  to  a  foreign government or international organization. 9.5.6.1.  Conventional  munitions  will  not  be  released  to  foreign  entities  outside  the  Air Force  without  AF/A4LW (T-1).  Units/organizations working potential FMS issues should contact A5R-C as early in the process as possible to minimize delays or to address other issues that may impact the approval process. and  AF/A5R-C coordination approval. 9.5.6.1.1.  The  GACP  is  the  focal  point  for  gathering  all  FMS  requests  for  release from current Air Force munitions stocks. 9.5.6.1.2.  The GACP Stockpile section is authorized to release non-PGM assets from current Air Force stock that are above 130-percent supportable. 9.5.6.1.3.  The  GACP  Stockpile  section  will  compile  all  other  requests  and  forward for approval to AF/A4LW for ground-munitions or AF/A5R-C for air-munitions. 9.5.6.2.  Requests  that  originate  at  the  Service/Agency  level,  will  be  coordinated  by AF/A5R-C (air-munitions) or AF/A4LW (ground munitions). (T-1). 9.5.7.  The  GACP  responds  to  direction  from  SAF/IA,  AFSAC  or  AF/A4LW  to  source munitions for release or shipment in support of approved FMS cases. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   207  9.5.7.1.  Delivery  of  FMS  assets  to  foreign  governments  may  be  time  sensitive.  The GACP  sources  assets  by  first  coordinating  with  the  requesting  MAJCOM  or  NAF munitions  staff  to  direct  timely  FMS  shipments.    FMS  shipments  are  processed  IAW paragraph 7.13.9. 9.5.7.2.  Munitions  designated  for  FMS,  tests,  training,  and  operations  conducted  by MOA/MOU are allocated under CAT Code N.  Refer to the annual PCAR memorandum distributed by the GACP. 9.5.8.  The  MAJCOM  munitions  staff  (or  equivalent)  interacts  and  advises  the  MAJCOM Foreign  Disclosure  Office  (FDO)  on  issues  related  to  sale,  lease,  or  loan  of  munitions, missiles,  and  ammunition  articles  or  munitions  related  services  to  a  foreign  government  or international organization within their AOR. 9.5.8.1.  When  requests  for  munitions  originate  from  a  foreign  government  or international  organization  within  the  MAJCOM  AOR  or  theater,  follow  procedures outlined in AFMAN 16-101 to initiate an FMS case.

When  requests/proposals  exceed  MAJCOM  FDO  delegated  authority,  the MAJCOM FDO will coordinate requests with the Disclosure Division, AF/IAPD. 9.6.  Disposition of Munitions. 9.6.1.  RCRA.  To meet current and future mission requirements, the munitions management program must incorporate protection of the environment as a national priority.  Federal and State  laws  and  regulations  establish  requirements  for  management  and  disposal  of  WMM.  Applicable federal law includes the MR (40 C.F.R., Part 266, Subpart M). 9.6.2.  ALC  Product  Group  Managers  will  conduct  an  annual  stockpile  analysis  to  identify serviceable excess assets following requirements determination through the NCAA process.  Disposition  of  serviceable  excess  assets  will  be  determined  during  the  TAMP  and  DLAR processes and prioritized for movement in the annual MMP. 9.6.3.  The  Product  Group  Managers  directs  redistribution  via  a  RDO  of  excess  serviceable items  to  satisfy  worldwide  requirements.    These  RDOs  will  be  coordinated  with  the  Lead MAJCOM, supported command, or NAF. 9.6.4.  Product  Group  Managers  shall  receive  and  process  ADRs  via  the  automated  ADR system on the GACP website. 9.6.4.1.  The Product Group Manager will establish a central ADR processing function to fully  considered  alternative  uses  of  reported  munitions  before  authorizing  disposal  of non-hazardous munitions.   208  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 9.6.4.2.  Processing function personnel should be experienced in munitions manufacture, use, storage/transportation, inspection, accountability, and stockpile management. 9.6.4.3.  The appropriate Air  Force DDA  will provide disposition instructions  within 60 calendar days after receipt of an ADR.  These  instructions may direct shipment of non-hazardous  munitions  to  any  of  the  following  locations:    A  base  from  a  different MAJCOM;  a  storage  location;  a  repair/recovery/  recycling  facility;  an  Army  or  Navy location; a FMS destination; or (as a last resort) a TTU. 9.6.4.4.  The Air Force DDA will maintain a record of all ADRs IAW with the Air Force RDS in AFRIMS to provide details of individual evaluations upon request. 9.6.5.  The  Product  Group  Managers,  GACP,  Munitions  Division,  Hill  AFB,  and  GACP, Armament Division, Robins AFB are the Air Force DDAs for the Air Force.  The SMCA is the DoD DDA. 9.6.5.1.  As defined in the MR, they are the only persons who are authorized to identify military munitions items as WMM. 9.6.5.2.  Hazardous  munitions  items  designated  by  EOD  as  Level  1  or  Level  2  do  not require Air Force DDA approval prior to emergency disposal. 9.6.5.3.  Munitions  found  off  base  and  declared  “ROUTINE”  and  have  an  unknown storage history, or are rendered/declared safe by EOD, will be evaluated from a storage and the  appropriate  Air  Force  DDA  for  disposition determination.

For  MPPEH  generated from  munitions  use,  definitions  of  specific demilitarization  and  disposal  procedures  to  comply  with  applicable  DoD  explosives safety standards, trade security controls, and demilitarization requirements. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   209  9.7.  GACP COTS Procedures. 9.7.1.  Munitions  System  Management.  Determination  for  management  through  the munitions system is made by the PM. 9.7.1.1.  This  determination  is  based  on  the  ability  to  assign  an  existing  (like  item)  TO, obtain  SPI,  account  for  items  through  CAS,  budgeting  and  procurement  requirements, and the ability to provide disposition for unserviceable and excess items. 9.7.1.1.1.  Because  munitions  items  are  centrally  procured  assets,  they  are  generally prohibited from local purchase.  Units can be authorized to locally procure munitions items  with  PM  approval,  however,  to  do  so,  the  PM  must  provide  the  procurement funds,  therefore,  the  PM  must  consider  provisions  of  AFI  65-601,  Vol.  1,  Budget Guidance and Procedures related to local purchase (LP) of centrally procured items when making these decisions. 9.7.1.1.2.  When  the  PM  has  approved  a  waiver  for  local  purchase  of  centrally procured  items,  and  the  local  LRS  officer  (MASO  for  munitions)  approves  the transaction, use customer funds for initial and follow-on procurement. 9.7.1.2.  If  the  PM  determines  requested  munitions  are  not  manageable  within  the munitions system, the request may proceed for IHC and NNMSB safety certification. 9.7.2.  NNMSB  Certification.  COTS  munitions  purchase  request  data  packages  will  be reviewed  by  GACP  CMPM  for  completeness  to  provide  the  NNMSB  with  sufficient information  to  certify  COTS  munitions  for  Air  Force  use.    If  additional  data  is  required, NNMSB member(s) will coordinate through GACP CMPM. 9.7.3.  HC  includes  assigning  hazard  class  and  division,  compatibility  group,  UN  number, and  explosive  weight.    An  IHC  or  HC  must  be  assigned  prior  to  placing  munitions  into operational service. 9.7.3.1.  The  Air  Force  Safety  Center  assigns  final  HC  for  Air  Force  munitions  upon completion of formal testing and/or analysis IAW TO 11A-1-47. 9.7.3.2.  IHC requests are submitted through the GACP website.  An IHC will be issued for  a  period  of  one  year.    Extensions  may  be  granted  provided  the  requesting  unit provides  complete  justification  and  has  submitted  data  to  the  CMPM  to  obtain  a  final hazard classification. 9.7.3.3.  COTS munitions packages disapproved for IHC or final HC will be returned to the requesting unit.  COTS munitions with expired IHC will not be used until revalidated or final HC is approved. (T-1). 9.7.4.  Bird  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  (BASH)  Program.  The  GACP  and  the  NNMSB approves  BASH  munitions  IAW  paragraph  7.3.8.5,  paragraph  7.4.10.6,  and  paragraph 9.7.4. 9.8.  Conventional Munitions Product Assurance Management. 9.8.1.  Life-Cycle Management Concept - Introduction.  Product assurance concerns exist from  the  inception  of  a  munitions  item  until  it  is  properly  disposed.    With  this  in  mind, personnel  at  all  echelons  are  stakeholders  in  the  process.  This  entails  proper  design,  life   210  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 cycle  testing,  the  inspection  process  and  reporting  of  discrepancies.  These  procedures  are essential for establishing the foundation of product assurance for munitions. 9.8.1.1.  All  higher  headquarters  and  management  activities  with  units  that  use conventional munitions items have product assurance duties, to include: 9.8.1.1.1.  Assisting and providing guidance to subordinate organizations to establish product assurance programs according to paragraph 3.1 and use PQDR, AFTO Form 22, AFTO Form 102, or alternative electronic means to identify munitions reliability, maintainability, or deficiency concerns to the appropriate ALC. 9.8.1.1.2.  Screening safety and accident investigation reports to refer any munitions issues to the appropriate ALC and product team. 9.8.1.1.3.  Developing procedures to monitor and survey the condition of munitions in use and in storage. 9.8.1.1.4.  Evaluating  the  skill  and  qualification  of  personnel  who  conduct  product assurance  duties  and  to  identify  requirements  to  the  AFCFM  and  AETC  during  the U&TW. 9.8.1.1.5.  Review of reliability and maintainability reports from ALCs and determine the  minimum  acceptable  performance  criteria  below  which  munitions  have  no identifiable combat utility.  Coordinate with HAF and the responsible ALC to remove from service and inventory, or restrict to training use only, those items that fall below established combat/training performance criteria. 9.8.1.1.6.  Ensuring  assets  are  made  available  for  life-cycle  testing,  if  charged  with developing  mission  need  statements.  Also,  incorporating  design  and  inspection requirements to maintain asset reliability while minimizing manpower impacts. 9.8.1.1.7.  Participate  in  forums  and  working  groups  to  resolve  product  assurance problems. 9.8.1.1.8.  Assess  the  effectiveness  of  munitions  product  assurance  programs  during unit level surveillance visits. 9.8.1.2.  AFMC  has  the  primary  responsibility  for  munitions  product  assurance  to include: 9.8.1.2.1.  Ensuring  resource  allocation  to  support  product  assurance  commensurate with the importance of high quality and reliable munitions. 9.8.1.2.2.  Investigating  munitions  deficiencies  reported  by  using  commands  and units.    Report  reliability  and  maintainability  results  from  investigations  and surveillance testing to using commands.  The ALCs will establish tracking systems to monitor  trends  and  analyze  data.    The  ALCs  will  provide  MAJCOMs  and  other customers with reports to provide results of the data analysis. 9.8.1.2.3.  Establishing, maintaining, and managing technical information and content for  inspecting,  testing,  storing,  maintaining,  handling,  transporting,  packaging, preserving,  disposing,  reconditioning,  modifying,  renovating  and  containerizing conventional munitions. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   211  9.8.1.2.4.  Ensuring  surveillance  is  maintained  over  Air  Force  munitions  stored  by other Services.  This includes ensuring the storing service is properly using allocated funds to store, inspect and maintain munitions. 9.8.1.2.5.  Conducting  surveillance  visits  to  other  services’  storage  sites  containing Air  Force  assets  every  2  years  to  determine  the  effectiveness  of  their  munitions product assurance program.  At the end of surveillance visit, conduct an out briefing with  the  other  services’  representatives  to  discuss  noted  deficiencies.    Furnish  a detailed written report of the surveillance visit to the agencies responsible for storage site.  Report will identify all deficiencies, their main causes, recommended changes, training requirements and personnel contacted during the visit.  Furnish the Air Staff, Lead  MAJCOMs  and  the  ARC  a  copy  of  the  written  report  on  the  status  of  the  Air Force stockpile stored at other services’ sites. 9.8.1.2.6.  Publishing  supplemental  policy  and  guidance  related  to  PSM  for  CAS-managed AF munitions. 9.8.2.  Product Design. 9.8.2.1.  Design Considerations. 9.8.2.1.1.  Product  assurance  for  conventional  munitions  must  begin  during  the conceptual  phase  of  the  acquisition  process  and  be  continued  throughout  the  life-cycle of the item. 9.8.2.1.2.  Munitions agencies give consideration to the operating environment faced by munitions.  Munitions are stockpiled for extended periods, withdrawn, and cycled from a ready state back to storage numerous times before finally being employed or disposed  of.    In  the  case  of  some  munitions,  electrical  continuity  tests  or  power-on operations may be a part of this cycling. 9.8.2.1.3.  Munitions  require  a  dual  consideration  of  reliability.    Munitions  must perform  their  mission  on  demand  (performance)  and  not  function  prematurely, inadvertently,  or  in  some  other  unexpected  manner  (safety).  Both  aspects  of reliability must be monitored and stringently controlled to maintain combat readiness and prevent personnel injury or property damage. 9.8.2.1.4.  Future  maintenance  requirements,  such  as  component  access  for  periodic inspection  requirements,  must  be  considered  in  the  design  stage.    Additionally, adequate  attention  must  be  given  to  packaging,  handling,  storage,  and  transporting requirements,  to  include  explosive  HC  for  transportation  and  storage  as  well  as  the operational (ground  handling/storage  and  flying)  environment.    Design criteria  must also  include  environmental  protection  issues  for  consideration  during  daily  use  and for disposal purposes. 9.8.2.1.5.  Accurate configuration control of the items must be maintained.  Changing NSNs  of  an  item  after  modifications  or  TCTO  changes  promotes  configuration control. 9.8.2.1.6.  Maintain  accurate  configuration  control  of  the  item  engineering  design throughout the munitions item life-cycle.   212  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 9.8.2.1.7.  During  design  phase,  consideration  must  be  given  to  the  future  need  to demilitarize/dispose of the item and, where possible, materials are selected that make this process easier.  Lean towards reclamation potential as much as possible. 9.8.2.1.7.1.  AFMC implements Design  for Demilitarization “DEMIL” (DFD)  as an  acquisition  initiative  into  the  systems  engineering  process  for  all  newly developed  ammunition  items  and  those  undergoing  engineering  changes  or renovation and maintenance. 9.8.2.1.7.2.  Military  Service  material  developers  will  follow  guidance  and  best management  practices  provided  by  SMCA,  to  influence  ammunition  design  in order to facilitate “DEMIL” operations.  The goal is to increase resource recovery and recycling, reduced execution cost, minimized reuse/disposal costs, enhanced safety, and environmental compliance. 9.8.2.1.7.3.  Provide  representatives  from  both  the  acquisition  and  “DEMIL” functional areas to participate in the DFD program. 9.8.2.1.8.  Provide  Technical  Data  packages  for  newly  fielded  conventional ammunitions and components to allow characterization and development of DEMIL plans and technologies. 9.8.2.2.  Initial  service  life  and  shelf  life  dates  for  munitions  are  based  on  design, manufacturing processes, materials and performance testing. 9.8.3.  Product Assurance Principles/Procedures. 9.8.3.1.  Product Assurance Reporting. 9.8.3.1.1.  All  munitions flights,  elements  and  munitions-using organizations  have  key  product  assurance  responsibilities  to  formally  report  any/all conditions  that  could  lead  to  injury  or  prevent  a  munitions  item  from  functioning properly. (T-1).  Reporting methods are outlined in paragraph 3.1.1.3. squadrons, 9.8.3.1.2.  Munitions-Managing Organizations. 9.8.3.1.2.1.  Report  to  munitions-using  organizations  by  official  e-mail  anytime munitions items are placed into a suspended or restricted status. (T-1). 9.8.3.1.2.2.  Report  back  to  the  submitting  organization  within  72  hours  upon receipt  of  a  PQDR.    Acknowledge  receipt  of  PQDR  and  provide  any  additional information regarding resolution of problem. (T-1). 9.8.3.1.2.3.  If  involved  in  the  investigation  of  an  accident  or  incident  involving munitions, provide an initial assessment to other potential users of the asset.  (T-1). 9.8.3.2.  Munitions Inspections and Surveillance: 9.8.3.2.1.  Munitions  activities  and  munitions-using  organizations  perform  required inspections IAW paragraph 3.1.1 and paragraph 3.1.2. (T-1). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   213  9.8.3.2.2.  Munitions-Managing  Organizations  (e.g.,  System  Program  Offices, GACP). 9.8.3.2.2.1.  Issue  special  and  one-time  inspection  guidance  and  procedures  as required. 9.8.3.2.2.2.  Implement  or  oversee  product  assurance munitions items managed by other services. responsibilities for 9.8.3.3.  Mishap and Incident Investigations.  The GACP maintains a MRRT of personnel knowledgeable  in  all  aspects  of  munitions  and  capable  of  responding  to  munitions incidents.    Procedures  for  contacting  team  are  provided  in  paragraph  1.6.1.2  and paragraph 3.1.1.4. 9.8.3.4.  Testing.    Most  munitions  are  “one-shot”  devices.    Reliability  for  “one-shot” devices  with  time-dependent  failure  characteristics  cannot  be  measured  absolutely.  Therefore, inferences must be made on reliability and useful life based on observing the performance of representative samples. 9.8.3.4.1.  Munitions-managing  and  procurement  organizations  must include sufficient quantities of munitions items for surveillance and aging testing throughout the forecast life-cycle of the item.  Also include sufficient assets in procurement for explosives safety and disposal testing. 9.8.3.4.2.  Use  munitions  test  information  and  all  available  historical  data  (ADR, PQDR,  CAS  Inspection  History,  etc.)  to  periodically  update  munitions  performance and  reliability  data  and  revise  munitions  inspection  and  surveillance  intervals  in appropriate technical data. 9.8.3.4.3.  Product Development Testing.  Good documentation of item performance during product development testing is essential to long-term product assurance. 9.8.3.4.3.1.  Incorporate explosive HC test data and detailed performance data in munitions surveillance plans. 9.8.3.4.3.2.  Capture  and  incorporate  Lot  Acceptance  Test  data  in  surveillance plans. 9.8.3.4.4.  Surveillance  Testing.    Surveillance  testing  is  intended  to  detect  and measure the gradual changes in munitions before those changes cause the item and/or system to fail.  Predicting future changes based on current measurements allows shelf life  and  service  determinations.    While  operational  tests  and  training  events demonstrate whether a munitions system  functioned or  not,  little  useful surveillance information is usually obtained. 9.8.3.4.4.1.  Perform  failure  analysis  testing  if  necessary  to  isolate  causes  of munitions failures and to determine if problem is widespread. 9.8.3.4.4.2.  Perform periodic testing of munitions to assess the impacts of aging on  item  reliability  and  performance.  Testing  should  not  only  include  those explosive  components  which  suffer  from  chemical  deterioration  but  any component  of  the  munitions  system  which  is  critical  to  system  operation  and safety.   214  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 9.8.3.4.4.3.  Match  test  frequency  to  predicted  item  deterioration  or  to  impact  of item failure.  When determining what munitions to test, consider high flight-hour accumulation of certain assets. 9.8.3.5.  Reliability Assessment and Product Deficiencies. 9.8.3.5.1.  Product Assurance Standards. 9.8.3.5.1.1.  Munitions-using  and  munitions-managing  organizations  establish performance  and  reliability  standards  during  item  development.    Document  the performance  standards  in  Mission  Needs  Statements  and  CPD  as  well  as surveillance test plans. 9.8.3.5.1.2.  If  determined  appropriate,  negotiate  product  warranties  and guarantees  with  the  item  developer.    Manage  the  warranted  item  to  validate warranty conditions are not violated and conduct surveillance testing of the item prior to warranty expiration to insure it meets warranted standards. 9.8.3.5.2.  Product Assessment. 9.8.3.5.2.1.  Munitions-management  organizations  (e.g.,  SPOs,  GACP)  gather munitions  performance  information  from  all  available  sources  in  reaching  a product reliability assessment. 9.8.3.5.2.2.  Compile  information  from  munitions  inspections  conducted  by  both munitions-using and managing organizations. 9.8.3.5.2.3.  Receive  and  conduct operational evaluations of combat weapon systems. reviews  of  performance reports from 9.8.3.5.2.4.  PQDRs provide useful information about the failure modes of an item and  organizations  are  required  to  use  the  PQDR  process  to  identify  munitions failures and discrepancies. 9.8.3.5.2.5.  Surveillance  testing  will  continue  to  provide  the  bulk  of  product assurance  information  and  a  test  program  must  be  conducted  periodically throughout an item's service life. 9.8.3.5.3.  Product Analysis. 9.8.3.5.3.1.  Use  actual  test  data  when  available  for  reliability  determination  and service life prediction. 9.8.3.5.3.2.  Long  Range  Services  Life  Analysis  is  a  structural  failure  prediction model, which assists in establishing the service life of missile propulsion systems.  Other computer models are coming into use to assist in determining reliability and service  life  of  other  conventional  munitions  items  and  their  use  is  strongly encouraged. 9.8.3.5.3.3.  If product performance (range, accuracy, lethality, etc.) has changed, notify  the  using  commands  and  the  Joint  Munitions  Effectiveness  Manuals (JMEM) group to make them aware of the current performance levels. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   215  9.8.3.5.4.  Product Deficiency.  When munitions are reported (through any means) to the  PM  or  IM  as  deficient  through  inspection,  testing,  failure  or  any  other  means,  a number of actions become possible. 9.8.3.5.4.1.  Item(s), S/N(s), or lot number(s) restriction or suspension. 9.8.3.5.4.1.1.  Restriction  or  suspension  of  a  munitions  item  is  usually  an interim action until one or more of the actions listed in this chapter are taken to resolve the deficiency/suspected deficiency. 9.8.3.5.4.1.2.  Restrict an item  when it  does  not  conform to all  specifications but is still serviceable for certain applications. 9.8.3.5.4.1.3.  Suspend  an  item  when  its  true  condition  is  not  known,  it  is determined  unserviceable,  or  its  service  life  has  expired.    Additional information on CCs for munitions is contained in TO 11A-1-10. 9.8.3.5.4.2.  Warranty Action. 9.8.3.5.4.2.1.  If a deficient item was procured with a manufacturer's warranty, invoke the warranty. 9.8.3.5.4.2.2.  Notify appropriate program management personnel of warranty conditions and expiration dates. 9.8.3.5.4.3.  Accept  deficiency  -  adjust  service  life.  Occasionally  the  munitions-using  and  managing  organizations  will  reach  agreement  that  a  munitions deficiency  is  too  costly  to  correct,  the  asset  is  too  mission-critical  to  restrict,  or has insufficient impact on system performance to warrant correction. 9.8.3.5.4.3.1.  If  appropriate,  adjust  the  service  life  of  the  item  or  the  use restriction code. 9.8.3.5.4.3.2.  If  the  deficiency  changes  the  performance  of  a  system,  update all appropriate technical manuals with the correct information. 9.8.3.5.4.4.  Initiate  product  improvement  program.    The  decision  to  correct  an item  deficiency  is  jointly  reached  by  the  munitions-using  and  managing organizations. 9.8.3.5.4.5.  Dispose or retire an item.  Munitions items that have reached the end of  their  service  life,  as  well  as  those  of  questionable  reliability,  must  be  retired from the inventory. 9.8.4.  Additional Product Assurance Responsibilities. 9.8.4.1.  Lead  MAJCOM.    All  munitions  items  have  a  designated  Lead  MAJCOM.  AFMC  is  the  Lead  MAJCOM  for  most  munitions  items,  however,  ACC,  AFSOC,  and AMC  have  specific  Lead  MAJCOM  responsibilities  for  munitions  due  to  Operational Test & Evaluation (OT&E) requirements for emerging systems and unique SOF or MAF requirements.  These Lead MAJCOMs will: 9.8.4.1.1.  Closely  work  munitions  concerns  with  the  managing  organization  until resolved.   216  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 9.8.4.1.2.  Identify  to  the  GACP,  munitions  items  that  are  obsolete  so  disposition actions can be initiated. 9.8.4.2.  Munitions/Missile PIWGs are conducted by the Munitions Product Group IAW AFI  21-118,  Improving  Air  and  Space  Equipment  Reliability  and  Maintainability,  to improve  product  reliability  and  maintainability.   Minimum  PIWG  membership composition includes the single manager(s), system support manager(s), Lead MAJCOM representative, and a representative from each using command. 9.8.5.  Requests to Modify Inspection Interval Requirements. 9.8.5.1.  Requests  to  change  inspection/surveillance  intervals  for  munitions  items  may result  in  TO    changes  based  on  validated  engineering  analysis.    These  requests  are submitted  using  an  AFTO  Form  22.    These  requests  do  not  apply  to  items  under warranty.   9.8.5.2.  Requests  shall  include  the  NSN,  however,  will  not  include  individual  lot numbers or local storage or handling conditions. (T-1). or in inspection or 9.8.5.3.  Requests  will  include  Lead  MAJCOM  coordinated  data  and  justification  to increase requirements. (T-1).  EXAMPLE:  Surveillance inspected,  defects discovered, type of defects discovered, defect rates, number of ADRs submitted, number of PQDRs submitted, etc. surveillance items interval  data,  quantity  of decrease 9.8.5.4.  Once  coordinated  by  the  Lead  MAJCOM  munitions  staff,  the  Lead  MAJCOM forwards  the  AFTO  Form  22  to  the  GACP  who  will  then  forward  the  request  to  the appropriate  office  for  evaluation.  The  ES  will  respond  to  these  requests  using  normal AFTO Form 22 response procedures. 9.8.5.5.  These  procedures  above  do  not  preclude  Air  Staff  or  Lead  MAJCOM  from requesting broad management analysis or review of munitions items or an item series for special review or analysis based on prevailing field conditions.  These requests should be fully supported by field level data and information. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   217  Chapter 10 WAR RESERVE MATERIEL (WRM) MUNITIONS 10.1.  General.  WRM  munitions  are  required  to  support  wartime  activities  listed  in  the  Air Force War and Mobilization Plan (WMP) until the industrial base meets wartime demands.  The forward presence stressed in the defense planning guidance (DPG) demands WRM munitions to be  stored  or  moved  quickly  to  critical  areas.    WRM  munitions  are  pre-positioned  at  operating bases,  dispersed  in  areas  of  responsibility,  placed  aboard  APF  vessels,  and  stored  at  selected units and depots for surface or air deployment. 10.1.1.  Refer  to  Attachment  1,  Glossary  of  References  and  Supporting  Information  for definitions of the WMP, Vol. 1 through Vol. 5, Logistics Feasibility Assessment Capability (LOGFAC) , WCDO, NCAA, TAMP, and DLAR. 10.1.2.  Refer  to  paragraph  3.6  for  instructions  and  guidance  on  classifying  information used, controlled, or produced from manual or automated munitions systems. 10.2.  Positioning  Objectives.  The  MAJCOM/NAF  will  provide  units  with  WRM  munitions positioning objectives using the WCDO for wartime requirements.  In addition, the most recent NCAA CTR pre-positioning objective for each theater will be used.  For OCONUS commands (e.g., USAFE, PACAF, and AFCENT) this is the CTR Starter Stock.  For other commands this is the CTR for all theaters supported. 10.3.  War Consumables Distribution Objective (WCDO). 10.3.1.  The  WCDO  is  developed  in  LOGFAC  where  the  Air  Force  WMP-4  resides.    The NCAA  interfaces  with  LOGFAC.    LOGFAC  distributes  the  NCAA  theater  requirement  to operating bases and results are published on the unit WCDO.  In addition to the information below, refer to the WCDO process outlined in AFI 25-101. 10.3.2.  For  all  WRM  commodities,  including  munitions,  the  WCDO  serves  as  the  theater positioning objectives for each stock record account. 10.3.3.  The  WCDO  provides  authorizations  for  starter  stock  munitions  to  support  OPLAN execution. 10.3.4.  Operations,  munitions,  plans,  and  intelligence  functions  cooperate  to  produce  the theater  WCDO. 10.3.4.1.  The  NCAA  establishes  munitions  requirements.    AF/A5R-C  provides  NCAA theater requirement interface file to the LOGFAC SPO for inclusion into LOGFAC.  The MAJCOM/NAF  logistic planners in coordination with Operations distribute the NCAA CTR to build the theater WCDO. 10.3.4.2.  MAJCOM/NAF logistics planners produce and coordinate the WCDO prior to distribution to unit WRM managers and the MASO.  The theater WCDO will match the NCAA CTR for the given theater. 10.3.5.  Munitions WRM distribution and realignment is performed through the GAP process IAW Chapter 15.   218  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 10.4.  WRM Munitions Financial Accounting.  In addition to guidance below, refer to AFI 25-101,  and  paragraph  2.6.7.5  and  paragraph  8.3.9  of  this  AFI  for  guidance  and  procedures  for developing, submitting, and managing the PEC 28030 WRM munitions O&M budget. 10.4.1.  The  PEC  28030  identifies  only  those  WRM  munitions  O&M  costs  supporting preservation and sustainment of the WRM munitions stockpile. 10.4.2.  Develop the PEC 28030 WRM munitions O&M budget IAW Air Force, MAJCOM, and Installation Financial Management (FM) policy and guidance. 10.4.2.1.  MAJCOM Munitions staffs collaborate with the MAJCOM FM to identify and communicate  appropriate  cost  elements,  budget  development,  and  submission procedures.  MAJCOMs shall communicate specific budget procedures to units annually through FM channels. 10.4.2.2.  Units  shall  seek  installation  and  MAJCOM  FM  guidance,  justify  all  costs related to PE 28030 expenses, and obtain approval by the unit Commander for all costs (as applicable). 10.4.3.  In  general,  when  not  funded  by  other  program  elements  (PE),  and  when  conducted IAW  FM  guidelines,  allowable  costs  associated  with  PEC  28030  include  maintenance  and reconditioning  (organic/contract),  maintenance  and  reconditioning  supplies,  storage  and facility  upkeep  (stantions,  placards,  shelving,  segregation,  fusible  links,  etc.),  preservation, and  administration  of  the  WRM  munitions  stockpile  to  include  daily  operating  support, training,  equipment  (to transportation, include  computer  hardware/software), administrative, and janitorial services and supplies. travel, 10.4.4.  Units that maintain WRM stocks and other non-WRM categories of munitions (e.g., peacetime  training,  RDT&E)  shall  establish  separate  financial  accounts  to  program  and manage O&M funds and expenses related to each account. 10.4.5.  Excluded from PEC 28030 allowable costs include: 10.4.6.  Any costs appropriately funded through another PE (seek FM guidance). 10.4.6.1.  Facility maintenance  and repair  costs,  military  construction,  security, procurement  of  munitions,  purchase  of  mobility  equipment,  activities  of  costs  unrelated to preservation and sustainment of the munitions WRM stockpile. 10.5.  Planning Logistics Support. 10.5.1.  All  US  Air  Force  war  or  contingency  plans  must  contain  a  logistics  annex sufficiently  detailed  to  enable  personnel  to  support  the  planned  operation  immediately  and efficiently.  MAJCOMs and NAFs develop the munitions appendix to this annex. 10.5.2.  Component  services  manage  logistics  support.    Each  service  determines  its requirements  and  budgets  for  necessary  commodities.    When  produced,  munitions  and missiles become stock, owned by the individual service component. 10.5.3.  Unified  commands  are  not  responsible  for  logistics  support  of  assigned  forces.  However,  on  execution  of  a  unified  OPLAN,  the  unified  commander  assumes  directive authority over all components in the operating theater. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   219  10.5.4.  The  NAF  will  coordinate  with  the  GACP  and  CAF/MAF  Lead  MAJCOMs  (ACC and AMC) to plan logistics support requirements. 10.5.5.  MAJCOMs and CMAs (e.g., GACP) provide logistics support at and below wing or base level for assigned units. 10.5.6.  Tenants coordinate support requirements with hosts before publishing any plan that commits host resources. 10.5.7.  When  units  on the  installation  are  tenant;  operating,  dispersing, or  staging  from;  or otherwise  utilizing  installation  facilities  and  resources  assigned  to  other  commands,  the commander with jurisdiction over the installation provides logistics support according to an approved  MOA  or  MOU.    Munitions  units  should  consider  the  following  when  reviewing MOA or MOU: 10.5.7.1.  Formal Joint Basing integration of munitions, safety, and security processes to include approved variances.  EXAMPLE:  Local management, CSA, Explosives Safety, Emergency Response, Movement Control, etc. 10.5.7.2.  Management of munitions assets required by sister services and not stock listed in CAS. 10.5.7.3.  Sharing and use of real property, real estate, facilities, and equipment. 10.5.8.  OCONUS commands (i.e., USAFE, PACAF, and AFCENT) in coordination with the appropriate NAF develop plans to receive and support augmenting forces.  They provide all requirements  for  planned  enroute  and  beddown  locations to  facilitate  reception and support planning. 10.5.9.  NAFs  help  unified  commands  assess  reserve  stocks  of  involved  allies  to  identify potential US Air Force support requirements. 10.5.10.  MAJCOMs  and  NAFs  assist  AFRC  and  ANG-gained  units to  compute requirements,  store  and  preposition  materiel,  and  prepare  for  activation  and  deployment,  as appropriate. 10.5.11.  ACC,  AMC,  and  AFSOC  advise  OCONUS  MAJCOMs  of  additional  logistics support  required  for  operations  in  the  overseas  area  to  provide  storage  and  maintenance capability.    The  GACP  and  NAFs  coordinate  with  storing  commands  before  acting  to preposition  any  materiel  or  changing  pre-positioning  in  WMP-4  which  would  increase  the consumable storage requirements. 10.5.12.  The  SMCA  operates  IAW  DoDD  5160.65,  Single  Manager  for  Conventional Ammunition  (SMCA),  and  DoDI  5160.68,  Single  Manager  for  Conventional  Ammunition (SMCA):  Responsibilities  of  the  SMCA,  the  Military  Services,  and  United  States  Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), and plays a major role in the munitions re-supply of Air Force  units.    A  significant  amount  of  Air  Force  munitions  are  stored  in  CONUS  Army depots.    The  GACP  maintains  oversight  and  surveillance  of  Air  Force  munitions  stored  in CONUS depot stock. 10.6.  Logistics Planning for Munitions Movement. 10.6.1.  When  unable  to  store  WRM  munitions  at  or  near  the  employment  base,  the MAJCOM/NAF in coordination with GACP may position munitions in central storage areas,   220  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 theater  storage  facilities,  or  at  other  operational  bases.    In  these  cases,  the  MAJCOM/NAF develops detailed plans and establishes MOU as necessary to facilitate movement of stocks when they are needed at wartime operating locations. 10.6.2.  OPLANs may direct combat aircraft to deploy with munitions aboard.  EXAMPLE:  Air-to-air  missiles,  20mm/30mm,  or  chaff  and  flare.    NAFs  identify  and  reflect  these  type movement  requirements  in  MAJCOM  or  theater  OPLANs  and  logistics  movement  plans.  Execution of the OPLAN activates this phase of munitions relocation. 10.6.3.  The  MAJCOM/NAF  TACP/RACP  and  GACP  optimize  pre-positioning  at  planned operating  bases  given  sortie  production  requirements,  threat  and  storage  and  transportation capabilities. 10.6.4.  The  MAJCOM/NAF  TACP/RACP  and  GACP  track  munitions  requirements  and distribution.  They initiate munitions movements not already covered by tactical movement.  The  MAJCOM/NAF  TACP/RACP  serve  as  consolidated  command  points  of  contact  with inter-theater and intra-theater support organizations. 10.7.  MAJCOM Command Overflow. 10.7.1.  The  NAFs  and  CAF,  MAF,  and  SOF  Lead  MAJCOMs  (ACC,  AMC,  and  AFSOC) must  identify  to  GACP  how  much  of  each  unit's  WRM  munitions  requirement  come  from CONUS stocks or production. 10.7.2.  Once  NAFs  and  Lead  MAJCOMs  determine  these  shortfalls,  they  submit  them  to GACP for sourcing. 10.7.3.  The GACP will: 10.7.3.1.  Source  theater  shortfall  requirements,  assures  TPFDD  transportation  support, and  publishes  an  approved  Air  Force  support  plan  for  each  MAJCOM/theater  OPLAN.  Redistribution or realignment of AFRC or ANG assets will be coordinated with AFRC or NGB. 10.7.3.2.  Coordinate support plans with the affected MAJCOM s/NAFs. 10.7.3.3.  Satisfy  the  planned  requirements  of  the  MAJCOM/NAF  as  far  as  possible, including  worldwide  redistribution  and  asset  realignment,  and  delivery  of  substitute munitions when preferred assets are not available. 10.7.3.4.  Reflect the following for command overflow shipments: 10.7.3.4.1.  Receiving DoDAAC. 10.7.3.4.2.  Shipping DoDAAC (when possible). 10.7.3.4.3.  Sequence of execution. 10.7.3.4.4.  Required Delivery Date  (RDD). 10.7.3.4.5.  Port of Embarkation  (POE). 10.7.3.4.6.  Port of Debarkation  (POD). 10.7.3.4.7.  Type of movement  (air, surface, unit move or deployment). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   221  support  plans 10.7.3.5.  Develop time-phased  munitions requirements.  These requirements come from the Wartime Aircraft Activity (WAA) file approved for the planned year.  Include outload and receipt capacity of break bulk/CADS points,  ports,  and  receiving  units  in  support  plans  to  schedule  arrival  of  all  munitions within a specified time period allowing time for off-load, transportation, storage, and use. to support theater 10.7.4.  All  executing  activities  maintain  plans  with  changes  as  they  occur.    Current  and executable information is provided to the SMCA, GACP, NAFs, and shipping and receiving units.    EXAMPLE:    When  a  MAJCOM/NAF  TACP/RACP  calls  forward  an  item  into  the operational theater, the executing activity accordingly reduces the command overflow. 10.8.  Munitions Call-forward. 10.8.1.  GACP:    Coordinates  requisitions  with  the  U.S.    Army  Joint  Munitions  Command (JMC) to meet MAJCOM RDDs. 10.8.2.  JMC  in-turn  will  submit  the  requisition  to  SMCA,  SDDC  and  Military  Sealift Command (MSC) as required for movement to meet RDD. 10.9.  Standard Air Munitions Package (STAMP). 10.9.1.  STAMP  enables  pre-selected  or  notional  tasked  tactical  air  units  to  deploy  rapidly and operate from locations without prepositioned munitions or until sustained re-supply lines can be established.  STAMP assets may also be tasked for surface movement (truck, rail, or vessel)  to  meet  planned  sustaining  requirements  when  logistics  lead-times  allow  such activity.    Sortie  rates,  aircraft  configurations,  and  logistics  planning  lead-time  dictate  the period of support from STAMP.  See paragraph 11.2 for sourcing procedures. 10.9.2.  In addition to STAMP, theaters may request and establish TARRP programs within the operational theater to realign theater stocks in the early stages of a contingency.  TARRPs are  designed  and  set-up  primarily  as  air-cargo  movement  assets,  however,  may  move  by surface modes when logistics lead-times allow. 10.9.3.  The  Air  Force  has  configured  APF  vessels  to  provide  component  commanders greater  deployment  flexibility  by  reducing  early  swing-stock  requirements  supported  by airlift.    APF  allows  strategic  swing-stock  munitions  to  move  rapidly  from  one  region  to another as priorities or circumstances dictate.  See paragraph 11.2 for sourcing procedures. 10.10.  War Reserve Stocks for Allies (WRSA). 10.10.1.  WRSA  comprises  US  military  service-owned  stocks in emergencies  only  to  make  up  for  shortfalls  in  allied  ATOs.    Higher  headquarters  must approve release of WRSA to allies during peacetime. intended  for  use 10.10.2.  Agencies  controlling  WRSA  and  MOU  stocks  use  these  guidelines  when developing joint operating instructions with allied nations. 10.10.3.  Manage WRSA assets on a separate DoDAAC, because item prices are constrained to the item's original acquisition cost or the approved negotiated WRSA price. 10.10.3.1.  Manage the WRSA inventory as other Air Force WRM munitions. 10.10.3.2.  Apply the same security measures to WRSA authorizations, levels, quantities and other parameters as you would to WRM.   222  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 10.10.3.3.  Keep WRSA at authorized and approved levels. 10.10.3.4.  Identify shortfalls to the NAF, MAJCOM, and GACP for resolution. 10.10.3.5.  WRSA  stock  will  be  segregated  from  the  Air  Force  stockpile  whenever storage  space  is  available.    If  munitions  must  be  commingled,  WRSA  stock  will  be appropriately identified. 10.10.3.6.  Never  use  WRSA  assets  to  satisfy  other  requirements  (e.g.,  RDO,  training) without  NAF  and  GACP  approval.    Report  to  the  owning  MAJCOM/NAF  any  action initiated at the local level that changes the identity or serviceability of WRSA assets. 10.10.3.7.  When the GACP directs the MAJCOM/NAF TACP/RACP to release WRSA stocks,  the  TACP/RACP  may  transfer  assets  either  in-mass  to  the  allied  user  or selectively based on allied ATO shortfalls.  Restrictions on release of WRSA items are as follows: 10.10.3.7.1.  Munitions  excluded  by  MAJCOM/NAF  TACP/RACP  or  GACP  (e.g., AIMs), will not be released, without AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-C approval. 10.10.3.7.2.  The dollar value imposed by Congressional authority for assets assigned to WRSA will not be exceeded. 10.10.3.7.3.  Release  of  WRSA  assets  will  be  terminated  when  the  assigned  dollar value  is  reached.  Additional  release  authority  must  be  obtained  before  additional requirements are through processed for FMS IAW paragraph 9.5. 10.10.3.8.  When  WRSA  release  notification  is  received  from  the  appropriate  authority, assets can be either transferred in-mass or selectively based on allied ATO shortfalls. 10.10.3.9.  Apply the MOA or other authorizing document between the US Government and the allied country when selling assets designated as WRSA in a military emergency. 10.10.3.10.  Proper  authority  may  direct  munitions  accounts  to  release  munitions  other than WRSA under a follow-on MOU to support allied shortfalls. 10.10.3.11.  Release  or  Transfer  Procedures.    On  receiving  a  RDO  for  WRSA  or  MOU release, affected bases prepare two sets of DD Form 1348-1A IAW AFI 23-101, AFH 23-123  V1,  Materiel  Management  Reference  Information,  and  AFH  23-123  V2,  Part  2, Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S), Standard Base Supply System Operations for all  FMS  transactions.

Purpose.  This  chapter  outlines  contingency  munitions  sourcing  for  Air  Force  activities and  establishes  a  standard  munitions  report.    The  Munitions  reporting  process  will  provide  the CJCS, CCDRs, and Air Force activities the ability to monitor critical munitions items, affecting warfighting  capabilities  during  contingencies,  emergencies,  or  exercises.    In  addition,  the reported information will be used in support of JMPAB deliberations.  AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-C represent the Air Force on the Munitions JMPAB. 11.2.  Contingency  Munitions  Sourcing  Process.  The  munitions  allocation  process  described in  paragraph  14.3 is  a peacetime pre-positioning process.  Once contingency  sourcing  begins, all munitions balances are available to support contingency operations. 11.2.1.  The MAJCOM/NAF TACP/RACP maintain authority and control for directing intra theater or intra command munitions movements to support operations.  The MAJCOM/NAF directs units for these movements through official SIPRNET, email, or secure fax. 11.2.2.  CAS  RDOs  will  be  initiated  by  the  GACP  upon  specific  direction  from  the MAJCOM/NAF requiring the move. 11.2.3.  When operational contingency requirements exceed theater availability or cannot be satisfied with munitions in the operational theater, the MAJCOM/NAF requests contingency sourcing to the GACP.  The following process outlines contingency munitions requests: 11.2.3.1.  To  facilitate  rapid  contingency  support,  before  operations  commence,  submit copies of supported OPLANs/CONPLANs that source STAMP or APF to the GACP with informational copies to AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-C. 11.2.3.2.  The MAJCOM/NAF TACP/RACP identifies and request sourcing of munitions to meet operational contingency requirements to the GACP via official SIPRNET, email or secure fax.  Provide the following information: 11.2.3.2.1.  Type of munitions/munitions components required by NSN. 11.2.3.2.2.  Quantity required. 11.2.3.2.3.  Ship to Location/DoDAAC. 11.2.3.2.4.  Required in-place date. Note:    Requests  for  ASM  (AIM-9,  AIM-120,  AGM-88,  or  ADM-160B)  are  submitted  to  the GACP, Armament Division, Robins AFB who will coordinate sourcing IAW the TAMP. 11.2.3.3.  The  GACP  will  coordinate  all  sourcing  requests  for  STAMP  and  constrained munitions  assets  in  short  supply  to  meet  operational  contingency  requirements  to AF/A5R-C for approval and AF/A4LW for concurrence. 11.2.3.4.  The  GACP  will  provide  availability  and  sourcing  options  to  AF/A5R-C  and AF/A4LW for decision-making. 11.2.3.5.  AF/A5R-C  and  AF/A4LW  will  provide  approve/disapproval  and  concurrence as appropriate. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   225  11.2.3.6.  The  GACP  will  notify  the  requesting  MAJCOM/NAF  TACP/RACP  of availability and approval/disapproval for TPFDD action. 11.2.4.  Munitions  Contingency  Reporting  Procedures.  AF/A4LW  or  AF/A5R-C  directs when  the  Air  Force  MUREP  is  submitted  to  the  Air  Staff.    MAJCOMs  and  NAFs  may implement  MUREP  to  support  theater  contingencies,  exercises,  or  training  events.    When directed,  units  submit  MUREP  to  their  MAJCOM/NAF  who  will  consolidate  reports  and forward  to  the  GACP.    Reports  address  the  status  of  all  theater  assigned  munitions  within their operational control to include APF assigned assets.  The GACP consolidates reports and submits to AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-C. 11.2.4.1.  MUREP  Reporting  Timelines  and  Suspense:    The  report  cutoff  time  will  be daily as of 2400Z (Zulu Time) with a transmission time NLT 0300Z the following day to the  MAJCOM/NAF.    Consolidated  reports  (with  attached  supporting  spreadsheets)  are due  to  GACP  NLT  0900Z  daily.    GACP  will  consolidate  and  forward  Air  Force MUREPs to AF/A4LW and AF/A5R-C NLT 1500Z daily or as directed.  Reports will be numbered  sequentially  and  will  cover  the  24-hours  immediately  preceding  the  cutoff time.   MUREP  reports  will  be  classified  SECRET. 11.2.4.2.  Report  Transfer:   The MAJCOM/NAF reports will be submitted to the GACP via official classified e-mail via the SIPRNET to the GACP: gacp@hill.af.smil.mil.  If classified e-mail is not available, submit  reports  via  secure  fax  or  secure  telephone  to  DSN:  777-2666  by  line  item.    The format for the MUREP is an excel spreadsheet. 11.2.4.3.  Specific MUREP Reporting Instructions: 11.2.4.3.1.  Items  to  be  reported  will  be  identified  at  implementation.    Items  will  be reported by: 11.2.4.3.1.1.

IT Governance and Requirement Process. 13.1.1.  The  IT  requirements  process  involves  all  centrally  managed  information  systems used by the munitions communities to include:  CAS, TMRS, IMDS/G081, and AIT. 13.1.2.  AF/A4LW will advocate for validated IT requirements.  Successfully advocating for IT  requires  adequate  preparation,  presentation,  planning  and  programming  actions  before presentation  of  initiatives  to  the  Enterprise  Logistics  Information  Technology  (ELIT) governance  board  for  prioritization,  approval,  and  funding  IAW  Air  Force  Guidance Memorandum (AFGM) 2014-20-5.3, Enterprise Logistics Governance (ELG) Structure. 13.1.3.  The IT requirements process provides a means to: 13.1.3.1.  Enable  AF/A4LW  and  Lead  MAJCOMs  to  bring  IT  requirements  and maintenance/sustainment  actions  forward  as  potential  solutions  for  prioritization, approval, and funding.  Lead MAJCOMs request input on IT requirements, maintenance, and  sustainment  actions  and  potential  solutions  from  supported  commands  prior  to presenting  new  requirements  to  AF/A4LW.    The  CAS  PMO  will  confer  with  the  CAF Lead MAJCOM and AFMC/A4MW to develop agreement and priorities for submission of future CAS requirements before submission to AF/A4LW. Note:    In  this  paragraph,  the  term  "requirements"  describe  new  changes  and  enhancements.  It does not include repairs for Deficiency Reports (DR) or daily CAS management activity. 13.1.3.2.  Improve  cross-flow  of  information  on  IT  solutions  currently  in  use,  test,  or development. 13.1.3.3.  Share  information  and  standardize  capabilities  and  solutions  to  reduce duplication  of  effort  and  waste  of  resources  resulting  from  developing  IT  solutions  that already exist or are in development elsewhere. 13.1.3.4.  Develop  fielding  plans  for  IT  solutions  recommended  for  Air  Force  wide implementation (to include training and funding requirements). 13.1.3.5.  Establishment  of  work  priorities  for  CAS  PMO  and  approves  software configuration changes to CAS. 13.1.4.  All IT requirements must be staffed, coordinated, prioritized, and approved through the ELIT governance process. 13.1.4.1.  AF/A4LW  is  the  munitions  functional  community  conduit  to  the  ELIT governance process.  Munitions IT requirements will be coordinated and staffed through the  Lead  MAJCOM  to  AF/A4LW.    AF/A4LW  will  present  all  initiatives  to  the  ELIT governance board. 13.1.4.2.  Any IT solution presented for Air Force approval must be sponsored by a Lead MAJCOM or AF/A4LW to be put forward to the ELIT governance board. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   235  13.1.4.3.  All  submissions  for  new  IT  requirements,  concepts,  or  solutions  must demonstrate a valid need supported by metrics or test data to support the proposal. 13.1.4.4.  The  CAS  PMO    will  develop  and  present  results  of  any  technical  evaluations they  perform  on  recommended  CAS  solutions  to  comply  with  system  architecture, security, safety, and interoperability standards. 13.1.5.  Responsibilities. 13.1.5.1.  AF/A4LW will: 13.1.5.1.1.  Evaluate,  prioritize,  and  submit  recommendations  for  presentation  of CAS requirements to the ELIT governance board. 13.1.5.1.2.  Review,  coordinate  on  and  approve  the  CAS  Expectation  Management Agreement (EMA). 13.1.5.2.  The  CAS  PMO  will  perform  cost  estimation,  technical  evaluation,  and implementation review for submitted CAS requirements. 13.2.  CAS System Management. 13.2.1.  CAS  Functional  Overview.  CAS  supports  Air  Force  combat  and  support  units, GACP  Munitions  Division  (Hill  AFB)  and  GACP  Armament  Division  (Robins  AFB),  and various  munitions  training  units/centers.    The  objective  of  CAS  is  to  improve  Air  Force combat  and  logistics  support  capabilities  by  providing  effective  near-real  time  munitions management and accountability at each level of combat execution from the unit to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 13.2.2.  Contingencies  and  Alternate  States/Modes  of  Operation.  By  design,  there  is  no “degraded” or  “alternate”  mode of  CAS operations.   Automated processing  requires a fully operational  connectivity  to  the  Internet.    The  primary  mode  of  operation  in  the  absence  of Internet connectivity or computer support is through manual post-post procedures identified in Attachment 2, Off-line Processing (Post-Post). 13.2.3.  CAS  System  Security.  CAS  is  an  unclassified  system  IAW  DoDI  8510.01,  DoD Information  Assurance  Certification  and  Accreditation  Process  (DIACAP).    The  data  and information  handled  by  the  CAS  application  operates  at  the  unclassified  sensitive  level (FOUO).  Refer  to  paragraph  3.6.3,  Table  3.1,  and  Table  3.2  for  specific  security classification requirements for munitions information. 13.2.4.  Automatic  Information  Technology  (AIT).  CAS  is  tasked  to  identify  and implement  approved  automatic  information  technologies  to  improve  munitions  data collection  and  streamline  munitions  maintenance  processes.    These  processes  includes  but not  limited  to  the  user  of  labeling  and  scanning  of  bar-codes,  use  of  Radio  Frequency Identification and mobile devices to provide data collection at the points of maintenance as event occur to improve data reliability and timeliness. 13.2.4.1.  CAS AIT software will utilize with the Air Force Enterprise Data Collection to standardize  data  collection  and  reuse  of  data  across  the  Logistic  community.  Applications  on  mobile  device  will  be  tailored  to  improve  processes  while  providing CAS the necessary information to create accountable the auditable transactions based on USERID and user permissions.   236  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 13.2.4.2.  AIT  software  will  provide  a  CAS  generated  response  for  each  transaction process  providing  either  a  “Success”  message  or  movement  “Error”.    Edit  these transactions to correct any error for storage conditions (i.e., NEW, CIIC, compatibility).  User will be notified if other conditions exist that prevent the transaction from processing correctly in CAS and these transaction will be captured in CAS AIT Conflict Resolution (AMP09A)  program  to  allow  user  the  correct  the  errors  by  editing  the  transaction  or deleting the transaction. 13.2.5.  System Performance.  Although numerous techniques exist for system performance measurement,  data  throughput  is  of  considerable  importance  to  the  user.    The  CAS processing  environment  permits  application  processing in  an  on-line, interactive  mode  with scheduled  batch  processes  executing  in  background  mode.    Actual  throughput  is  dependent upon  the  execution  mode  mix.    EXAMPLE:    The  volume,  type  of  execution  request,  and number of users signed on at any point in time.  Large file downloads should be run during end-of-day processing.  However, end-of-day processing in one time zone may impact users in different time zones. 13.3.  CAS  -  System  Administration  (SA).  There  are  four  levels  of  CAS  SA  roles.    These levels  and  roles  are:  Combat  Ammunition  System  -  System  Program  Office  (CAS  SPO)  (also the Functional SA), GACP SA, MAJCOM SA, and the LOCAL SA.  Depending upon their level of authorization, the SA has the capability to add, change, or delete a CAS user from the system at their level or below.  Based on an approved CAS - DD Form 2875, the SA assigns permissions for  the  User  Role,  additional  specific  programs,  and/or  functional  duties  that  may  be accessed.  In order for the menu to be created dynamically upon user login, the SA must assign permissions  using  the  CAS  User  Administration  (AMA01A)  program  to  designate  specific programs for individual user access. 13.3.1.  CAS  Functional  System  Administrator  (FSA).  The  CAS  FSA  (CAS  PMO) (AFLCMC/HIAM)  is  responsible  for  the  overall  functional  administration  of  the  CAS application  software  and  database  residing  on  the  GCSS-AF  Integrated  Framework.    These FSAs  act  as  intermediaries  for  the  Defense  Information  Systems  Agency  (DISA)  and  the CAS  functional  users.  EXAMPLE:  If  a  database  recovery  was  required,  the  FSA  would inform  DISA.  The  Air  Force  authorizes  access  levels  to  empower  the  lowest  management levels,  minimize  functional  and  MAJCOM  involvement,  simplify  administration  tasks,  and decentralize  execution,  to  implement  enterprise  standards.  These  procedures  clarify separation of duties required by personnel supporting the three-tier level (PMO, MAJCOM, and Base Level) CAS application software residing on the Air Force Portal. 13.3.1.1.  Appointing the CAS FSA.  The CAS PMO will appoint FSAs in writing.  The appointed FSAs are authorized to grant CAS ADMIN and USER privileges to authorized CAS  users.    The  FSA  appointments  will  be  validated  annually.    The  CAS  PMO  will submit  a  memorandum  to  HQ  GCSS-AF  requesting  the  listed  personnel  be  granted  the CAS_ADMIN  role,  which  in  turn  enables  the  CAS  PMO  the  ability  to  grant  or  delete privileges to appointed MAJCOM and Base level SAs. 13.3.2.  CAS  SPO.  The  CAS  SPO  role  assigns  CAS  roles  to  all  levels  of  CAS  personnel.  The  assignment  of  the  ADMIN  role  will  be  accomplished  using  a  tiered  method  where  the CAS SPO will have overall authority.  The CAS SPO is responsible for assigning the CAS-ADMIN-MAJCOM  group  in  Tivoli  to  MAJCOM  SAs,  who  in-turn  are  responsible  for AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   237  assigning  the  CAS-ADMIN-BASE  group  in  Tivoli  to  the  Local  SA  at  installations/bases within their MAJCOM domain.  When the SA is assigned the CAS_ADMIN group they have the ability to assign the CAS_USER group to anyone at their level and below. 13.3.3.  MAJCOM or GACP SA.  The MAJCOM A4W (or equivalent)/GACP Management (O-6/GS-14)  will  appoint  a  primary  and  alternate  MAJCOM/GACP  CAS  SA  in  writing  to include name, rank, DoDAAC, unit, office symbol, DSN phone number, portal login ID, and security clearance. 13.3.3.1.  Brief  the  appointed  MAJCOM/GACP  SA  on  specific  computer  training  and awareness issues as outlined in AFI 33-200. 13.3.3.2.  Forward  a  copy  of  the  MAJCOM/GACP  SA  appointment  memorandum  and the SAs CAS - DD Form 2875 as outlined in paragraph 13.3.4 to the CAS PMO. 13.3.3.3.  When the primary or alternate AJCOM/GACP SA is relieved of his/her duties, a  new  appointment  memorandum  must  be  accomplished  identifying  the  successor  and will reference the superseded memorandum. 13.3.3.4.  Validate the appointment memorandum for currency annually. 13.3.3.5.  Upon  receipt  and  validation  of  the  MAJCOM/GACP  SA  appointment memorandum and CAS - DD Form 2875, the CAS PMO will sign the DD Form 2875 and grant  CAS  ADMIN-MAJCOM  role  to  the  MAJCOM/GACP  SA.    Once  the  ADMIN-MAJCOM role is assigned to the MAJCOM/GACP SA and appears in the SA's Air Force Portal, they will be able to access the Air Force portal link, however, this will not grant access to the CAS application.  The MAJCOM/GACP SA will then have to be loaded to the CAS application using the Admin menu, User Management option in the application software to be able to access the application software. 13.3.3.6.  The  MAJCOM/GACP  SA  Role.  The  MAJCOM/GACP  SA  is  the  point  of contact (POC) for all matters relating to the CAS application for MAJCOM/GACP users assigned  to  the  bases  and  organizations  they  support.    Based  on  the  coordinated  and approved CAS - DD Forms 2875, the MAJCOM/GACP SA Shall: 13.3.3.6.1.  Provide  administrative  privilege  to  trusted  users  in  order  to  perform  SA functions  at  locations  within  the  MAJCOM  domain.    The  primary  or  alternate MAJCOM SA is granted unique roles; therefore, as a minimum, one of the appointed administrators  must  be  available  to  support  daily  CAS  operations.    By  granting access, the SA  is  entrusting  the  security  of  the system  to  individuals  assigned.    The MAJCOM  SA  can  load  CAS  roles  to  MAJCOM  users  and  base  users  within  their command in the application software. 13.3.3.6.2.  Receive  and  validate  Local  SA  appointment  memorandums  and  receive and sign CAS - DD Form 2875 for Local SAs (as applicable) and MAJCOM/GACP CAS  General  Users.    Once  validated,  the  MAJCOM/GACP  SA  grants  the  CAS ADMIN  privileges  if  the  appropriate  GCSS-AF  Integrated  Framework  logins  have been  assigned.  If  no  Local  SA  is  assigned/available  at a  unit, the  MAJCOM/GACP SA with appropriate approvals, may act as the Local SA in their absence. 13.3.4.  CAS  Access.  Tivoli Access Manager Groups are assigned to every individual with access to CAS IAW  Table 13.1, Tivoli CAS Groups and assign permissions using the CAS   238  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 User  Administration  (AMA01A).  All  personnel  must  complete  DoD  IA  training  prior  to being granted access to CAS. (T-1).  DoD IA training will be re-accomplished annually. (T-1).  CAS  Program  Management  Office  (CAS  PMO),  munitions/missile  System  Program Office  (SPO),  Headquarters  staff  personnel  (Air  Staff,  MAJCOM,  NAF,  etc.),  and  GACP obtain access to CAS as follows: Note:  Base level personnel obtain access to CAS IAW paragraph 2.6.6. Note:  The CAS - DD Form 2875 includes System Rules of Behavior located at the Conventional Munitions site:  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afcm/A2I/CAS%20222%20IP/Forms/AllItems.aspx.  SharePoint® A2I 13.3.4.1.  CAS  PMO  (SPO),  GACP  (including  Munitions/Missile  SPOs),  and  HQ  staff (Air Staff, MAJCOM, and NAF) personnel requiring access to CAS, to include General User access, must submit a CAS - DD Form 2875 to their supervisor/government sponsor IAW AFMAN 33-282 and this AFI.  The requestor (e.g., CAS User) will complete Part I (blocks  1-12)  of  the  CAS  -  DD  Form  2875  and  forward  to  their  supervisor,  or government sponsor (for contractors).  When signing the CAS - DD 2875 in block 11, the requestor is acknowledging the CAS Rules of Behavior outlined in Block 21.   Table 13.1.  Tivoli CAS Groups.

CAS-Admin-MAJCOM:  Administrator  privilege  for  the  MAJCOM  SA  who  provides  the ability  to  assign  the  portal  link  to  MAJCOM  users,  base  administrators  or  local  users  within their command. CAS-Admin-Base:  Administrator privilege for the Local Base SA who provides the ability to assign the CAS portal link to base level administrators and users. CAS-Users:  Privilege that allows access to the CAS application. CAS-Training:  Privilege that allows access to CAS Training only.  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   239  13.3.4.1.1.  A  CAS  “General  User”  has  no  ability  to  process  CAS  accountable  or auditable transactions.  However, General Users still require a CAS – DD Form 2875 signed and approved by the CAS SPO SA, MAJCOM SA, or GACP SA, since they have access to CAS data and information, and may run CAS queries and reports. 13.3.4.1.2.  With  an  approved  CAS  -  DD  Form  2875,  the  CAS  SPO  SA,  MAJCOM SA, or GACP SA may grant MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU level EOD personnel General User access to CAS for planning purposes. 13.3.4.2.  The  supervisor  or  government  sponsor  will  verify  Part  I  and  complete  Part  II (blocks 13-20b) and forward to the SA.  The supervisor or government sponsor will enter the appropriate CAS User Role and/or Duty Function in Block 13 along with justification for  CAS  access.    Refer  to  Attachment  6  to  identify  the  appropriate  User  Role  and/or Duty Function on the DD Form 2875. 13.3.4.3.  The  CAS  SPO  SA,  MAJCOM  SA,  or  GACP  SA  is  the  activity  Information Owner  for  CAS  and  will  validate  Part  I  and  complete  Part  II  (blocks  21-27).    The  SA signs  block  21  of  the  CAS  -  DD  Form  2875  approving  access  to  CAS  access  for  their organizational/general users and routes to the Unit Security Manager. Note:  The CAS SPO SA, MAJCOM SA, or GACP SA signs block 21 of the CAS - DD Form 2875 when no MASO is assigned (e.g., MAJCOM, no DoDAAC established, DoDAAC has no assets).    Munitions  System  Program  Office  –  Program  Managers  (PM)  will  sign  block  21  for PMO and SPO personnel.  The MASO, SA, or PM will not sign/approve their own CAS - DD Form 2875. 13.3.4.4.  The  Unit  Security  Manager  validates  background  investigation  and  security clearance  data,  completes  Section  III  (blocks  28-32),  and  signs  block  31.    The  Security Manager forwards to the SA for final processing. 13.3.4.5.  The  SA  grants  CAS  access  through  the  Tivoli  Access  Manager  utilizing  the groups  in  Table  13.1  and  CAS  User  Roles  and  Functions  in  Attachment  6  to  assign permissions  and  designate  specific  programs  using  the  CAS  User  Administration (AMA01A) program.  The SA will then complete Part IV of the CAS  - DD Form 2875 and sign under “Processed By”. 13.3.4.6.  The CAS PMO PM reviews and approves CAS access for the CAS SPO SA.  A CAS SPO SA, MAJCOM SA, or GACP SA will submit their CAS  - DD Form 2875 to the CAS PMO for review and approval of CAS access.  The CAS PMO SA reviews and approves CAS access for GACP SAs and MAJCOM SAs.  The CAS PMO will maintain an  organizational  e-mail  account  to  receive  and  process  CAS  –  DD  Form  2875s submitted by the CAS PMO SA, GACP SA, and MAJCOM SAs for CAS access. for  all types  of  CAS  Users 13.3.4.7.  The  CAS  PMO  PM,  CAS  SPO  SA,  MAJCOM  SAs,  and  GACP  SAs  shall maintain  a  copy  of  all  CAS  -  DD  Forms  2875  they  have  signed  as  the  ‘Appointee’  or ‘Approver’ in AFRIMS.  Responsibility  for  retaining  specific  CAS  –  DD  Forms  2875  are  shown  in Table  13.2,  CAS  –  DD  Form  2875  Retention  Responsibilities.  The  CAS  SPO  SA, MAJCOM  SAs,  and  GACP  SAs  shall  file  all  CAS  -  DD  Forms  2875  within  their approved File Plan IAW the Air Force RDS in AFRIMS.

Conventional  Munitions  Requirements.  Munitions  requirements  are  determined  using the guidance prescribed in DoDI 3000.04.  The annual process to determine requirements is led by  AF/A5R-C.    The  process  depicted  in  Figure  14.1,  Air  Force  Conventional  Munitions Requirements  Process  produces  a  five-year  munitions  forecast  that  is  the  primary  vehicle  to request  and  allocate  air-to-ground  and  ground  munitions  required  for  test,  training,  and operational needs.  The most current allocation CAT and Requirements Codes can be located in the AMST/Reference Lists. Figure 14.1.  Air Force Conventional Munitions Requirements Process.  14.1.1.  Munitions  Working  Group  (MWG).  The  purpose  of  the  MWG  is  to  educate  the munitions  requirements  stakeholders  on  the  process,  update  stakeholders  on  current munitions  status,  use  accurate  munitions  and  weapons  effects  data  in  analysis,  and understand relevant changes to theater operations plans.  Topics will include: 14.1.1.1.  Briefings  on  munitions  in  production/development,  focused  on  employment issues and the operational impact of logistics supportability. 14.1.1.2.  WSEP reviews. 14.1.1.3.  Theater  employment  and  HAF  activities,  process  improvements,  lessons learned, and action items pertaining to GAP, requirements, and stockpile allocations.  The GACP  provides  an  overview  of  the  previous  year’s  GAP  and  major  changes  to forecasting procedures. 14.1.2.  Theater  Working  Group  (TWG)  meetings.  The TWG meetings are an extension of  the  MWG  during  which  AF/A5R-C  NCAA  branch  visits  NAFs  as  dictated  by  National   246  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 Defense  Strategy,  Guidance  for  the  Development  of  the  Force  (GDF),  and  MRP Implementation  Guidance  to  refine  munitions  employment  and  utilization.    The  respective theater  hosts  the  TWG  meeting  ensuring  appropriate  participation  of  theater  warfighters.  Representatives from operations, intelligence, plans and logistics shall attend these meetings to provide theater inputs and assumptions for the NCAA development process.  These inputs and assumptions are then used to define each theater’s WRM and training requirements and Expenditure Per Sortie Factor (EPSF) rates. 14.1.3.  TAMP.  The annual TAMP is an AF/A5R-C sponsored, WR-ALC hosted event. 14.1.3.1.  The  purpose  of  the  TAMP  is  to  serve  as  a  discussion  forum  and  to  make positioning decisions for existing ASMs (e.g., AIM-9, AIM-120 and AGM-88). 14.1.3.2.  Agenda  topics  include:    Briefings  on  air  superiority  munitions  program  and beddown  updates,  projected  inventory  status,  test  and  evaluation  requirements,  WSEP status, CATM requirements, and allocation and requirements methodology. 14.2.  Munitions Requirements Forecast Process.  The munitions forecast is an annual process to identify munitions requirements in Categories A, B, C, D, E, F, N, and T.  The annual PCAR memorandum  provides  specific  procedures  and  CAT  Code  definitions.    The  overall  process  is described in the following paragraphs: 14.2.1.  Munitions  requirements  are  derived  from  AFI  11-212;  AFCATs  21-209,  Volume  1 and  Volume  2,  and  their  associated  GMAT  tables  on  the  GACP  website;  the  Air  Force Standard for Non-Expendable Air Munitions Training Authorizations, the UCML, test plans, expenditure history, bed-down plans, and the PCAR memorandum.  Munitions requirements categories are defined in the PCAR memorandum. 14.2.2.  The  GACP  initiates  the  process  in  coordination  with  AF/A5R-C  and  AF/A4LW  by providing  the  annual  requirements  forecast  instructions  to  MAJCOM  munitions  staffs  not later than 15 October.  The forecast instruction memorandum notification will be e-mailed to MAJCOM/NAF MUFMs and munitions staffs and content posted to the GACP website. 14.2.3.  MAJCOM/NAF  A4  munitions  staffs  will  distribute forecast instructions to the MAJCOM/NAF MUFMs and the MASOs.  MUFMs will consolidate and validate  munitions  requirements  and  develop  the  consolidated  forecast  according  to paragraph 7.3.1.2. requirements 14.2.4.  Forecasting and Managing CAT Code B (non-NCAA WRM) Allocations.  CAT Code    B,    Miscellaneous  munitions  authorizations  are  forecasted  and  allocated  against requirement code BP using AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1 and the GMAT for Ground Munitions on  the  GACP  website.    Approved  allocations  are  distributed  programmatically  by  Using Commands, according to Table 14.1, Miscellaneous Munitions (Requirement Category BP) Distribution before the DLAR is published. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   247  Table 14.1.

The CONUS base-allocated Cat Code BP quantities breakdown as follows and total 100-percent: 14.2.4.2.1.  30-percent  of  CONUS/CONUS  allocation  will  be  reserved  at  the MAJCOM hold accounts until deployment tasking. 14.2.4.2.2.  45-percent  of  the  total  CONUS  allocated  quantity  will  be  distributed by the Using Command among  the  OCONUS  commands  (15-percent  each)  as  an  OCONUS    theater    pre-  positioning  objective.    CONUS  units,  will  not  requisition these quantities. (T-1).   248  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 14.2.4.2.2.1.  15-percent of the CONUS allocated quantity will be the OCONUS theater pre-positioning objective for each OCONUS command (PACAF, USAFE, and  AFCENT).    OCONUS  commands  will  identify  theater  pre-positioning locations,  by  DoDAAC,  and  requisition  designated  unit  quantities  necessary  to satisfy the allocated pre-positioning quantity. 14.2.4.2.2.2.  If OCONUS commands cannot store CONUS pre-positioned assets at  the  intended  base,  the  OCONUS  command  positions  assets  in-theater  at  a location that can support theater logistics movement. 14.2.4.2.2.3.  OCONUS  commands  apply  quantities  in  excess  of  the  command’s OCONUS  allocation the  CONUS  pre-positioned  allocation  before requisitioning.  Only requisition pre-positioning quantities when existing assets do not satisfy the total OCONUS and CONUS pre-positioned allocation. to 14.2.4.2.3.  25-percent  of  the  total  CONUS  allocated  quantity  will  be  the  STAMP positioning objective.  CONUS units, including ARC units, will not requisition these quantities. (T-1).  STAMP will requisition and position these assets. (T-1). 14.2.4.3.  The  GACP  will  assess  CONUS  base  excesses  over  the  30-percent  CONUS base  positioning  objective  for  potential  realignment  to  meet  STAMP  positioning objectives.  CAT-BP  excess  over  the  30-percent  CONUS  positioning  objective  may  be used to support other known requirements (e.g., CAT-D, Training ) with GACP approval. 14.2.4.4.  The  GACP  in  coordination  with  AFMC/A4MW  develops  UTC  according  to AFI 10-401 to support STAMP outload of these assets. 14.2.4.5.  CONUS and OCONUS excess and shortage conditions will be satisfied through the GAP and MMP processes. 14.2.4.6.  CONUS units will include the 30-percent CONUS, 45-percent OCONUS pre-positioned  and  the  25-percent  STAMP  positioned  quantities  as  “available”  for  SORTS reporting. 14.2.5.  Requirements for ejector cartridges must be factored into the forecast. 14.2.6.  Requirements  of  air-to-ground  munitions  for  aircrew  and  ground  crew  training  are determined IAW AFI 11-212.  ACC/A3TW, AFMC, and AFSOC submit RAP requirements to the GACP and AF/A5R-C annually. 14.2.7.  The  NAF  forecasts  for  OCONUS  CAT  Code  T  requirements  and  the  Lead MAJCOM  forecasts  for  CONUS  CAT  Code  T  requirements.    Lead  MAJCOMs  coordinate with  supported  commands  during  development  of  CONUS  CAT  Code  T  requirements forecasts. 14.2.8.

Any disputes regarding changes made to the forecast will be sent to AF/A5R-C, AFSFC/SFXW,  and  AFCEC/CXD.    The  Air  Staff  will  resolve  any  open  issues  and validate final munitions requirements changes. and 14.3.  Munitions  Allocation  Process.  AF/A5R-C,  AF/A4LW,  AFSFC/SFXW, AFCEC/CXD  co-chair  and  the  GACP  hosts  the  Munitions  Allocation  working  group.    The allocation  working  group  is  used  to  match  limited  worldwide  inventory  against  validated requirements  (derived  from  the  requirements  working  group).    Munitions  beddown  plans  are validated against asset allocations and necessary adjustments are made.  The following should be considered:  Substitute munitions and items when the primary munitions are unavailable (while substitutes may satisfy one or more functions, it might not necessarily perform satisfactorily in all  instances);  issues  that  impact  deployments,  ANG,  AFRC,  and  training;  available infrastructure;  and  new  or  revised  mission  changes  to  include  Base  Realignment  and  Closure announcements. 14.3.1.  The GACP  will release an Air Staff coordinated agenda for the allocation working group.  Air Staff will provide the parameters for stockpile optimization for inclusion with the agenda. 14.3.1.1.  Ten duty days before the allocation working group, the GACP will provide the MAJCOM/NAF  MUFMs  with  information  relative  to  inventory  availability  and  other issues. 14.3.1.2.  Attendees  will  be  limited  to  those  activities  invited  by  the  allocation  working group memorandum (e.g., host, chair, co-chairs, MAJCOM/NAF munitions staff). 14.3.2.  The Munitions Allocation Working Group. 14.3.2.1.  AF/A5R-C,  AFSFC/SFXW,  and  AFCEC/CXD  decide  the  priority  order  of build  for  stockpile  optimization.    Stockpile  optimization  is  the  process  of  merging  the available inventory with the priority build list to achieve a supportability position.  At the beginning  of  the  allocation  working  group,  these  activities  will  brief  the  prioritization methodology. 14.3.2.2.  AF/A5R-C, AFSFC/SFXW, and AFCEC/CXD decide allocations. 14.3.2.3.  MAJCOM/NAF  representatives  will  observe,  advocate  interests,  and  support other MAJCOMs. 14.3.3.  The  GACP    records  the  allocation  decisions  in  the  initial  DLAR  and  provides  it  to the  MAJCOM/NAF  munitions  staffs,  AF/A5R-C,  AFSFC/SFXW,  and  AFCEC/CXD  NLT two weeks after the working group. 14.3.4.  MAJCOMs and NAFs will use an initial DLAR to prepare prior to the GAP working group convening. 14.3.5.  A final DLAR is published NLT 30 calendar days following the GAP working group convening.    MAJCOM/NAF  munitions  staffs  will  facilitate  the  allocation  process  by assisting  the  MAJCOM/NAF  MUFMs.    MUFMs  will  finalize  theater/command  positioning decisions in AMST prior to the GAP Working Group convening. 14.3.6.  For tenant units, The MAJCOM/NAF MUFM sends using NAF theater allocations to the host MAJCOM/NAF theater providing munitions support.  Host MAJCOM/NAF theaters   250  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 cannot  change  allocations  for  tenant  units.    MAJCOMs/NAFs  notify  the  GACP  of  any host/user allocation transfers. 14.4.  Allocation Increase or Addition Requests.  Request for allocation increases or additions will be prepared and coordinated IAW paragraph 7.4.2 and paragraph 7.4.3. 14.5.  Buy-Budget  Process.  The munitions Buy-Budget Review (BBR) addresses procurement of  conventional  ground,  air-to-ground,  demolition  and  EOD  munitions,  small  arms,  and associated  equipment  (excluding  missiles).    The  procurement  of  SOF  unique  MFP-11 conventional  ground,  air-to-ground,  small  arms  and  associated  equipment  is  conducted  by USSOCOM.    Procurement  of  these  items  is  part  of  the  overall  DoD  Planning,  Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) system. 14.5.1.  The  GACP  hosts  and  AF/A5R-C,  AF/A5XS,  and  SAF/AQXR  co-chair  the  BBR  in April  to  facilitate  preparation  of  Budget  Estimate  Submission  (BES)  /  Program  Budget Review  (PBR)  justification  documentation  for  Procurement  of  Ammunition,  Air  Force (Appropriation 3011), Munitions and Related Equipment (Budget Program 3500). 14.5.1.1.  Prior  to  the  BBR,  the  GACP  and  other  affected  AFMC  product  centers  will prepare a Buy Book of  budget  exhibits and provide an advance copy to assist BBR co-chairs  and  AFCEC/CXD  in  determining  munitions  and  associated  equipment  funding priorities. 14.5.1.2.  During the BBR: 14.5.1.2.1.  The  GACP    will  present  procurement  recommendations  based  on forecasted  requirements,  inventory  analysis,  prior  procurement  action  and  industrial production capabilities. 14.5.1.2.2.  SAF/AQXR  will  analyze  procurement  data  and  recommend  the  best  use of funds. 14.5.1.2.3.  The PEM establishes the final funding priorities based on all information provided. 14.5.1.3.  After the BBR: 14.5.1.3.1.  The GACP will prepare and distribute formal minutes of the proceedings and  ship buy books and other classified materials requested to BBR participants. 14.5.1.3.2.  SAF/AQXR will issue specific guidance and instructions to the ALC and product centers for the BES in a budget call memorandum. 14.5.1.4.  All agencies responsible for P-series budget exhibits will submit documents to SAF/AQXR  based  on  funding  priorities  established  at  the  BBR  IAW  the  budget  call memorandum. 14.5.1.5.  SAF/AQXR will publish and distribute the final budget submission document. 14.6.  Expenditure  Reporting.  Expenditure  reporting  is  a  critical  data  element  of  munitions management processes at all levels (i.e., Unit, Base, NAF, MAJCOM, and Air Staff). AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   251  14.6.1.  Past  expenditures  help  DoD  determine  allocation  levels,  develop  buy-budget decisions,  and  defend  procurement  decisions  to  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense, General Accounting Office (GAO), and Congress. 14.6.2.  Expenditure procedures are outlined in paragraph 7.11.   252  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 Chapter 15 GLOBAL ASSET POSITIONING (GAP) 15.1.  Program  Scope.  GAP  integrates  five  munitions  WRM  positioning  programs  to  meet anticipated demands on time and resources.  These provide theater commanders with their initial starter  stocks,  provide  rapid  swing  stock  response  capability  with  the  APF  and  STAMP  and provides for operational swing-stock positioning by theaters and CONUS. 15.2.  The  Global  Asset  Positioning  (GAP)  Working  Group.  AF/A4LW  sponsors  and  the GACP hosts activity of the GAP working group and establishes positioning goals and objectives for  the  Air  Force,  resolves  issues  of  mutual  concern  and  develops  a  munitions  positioning strategy for near- and mid-term munitions components for WRM, test, and training. 15.2.1.  SPO  participation  is  critical  to  acquisition  support  of  GAP  decisions.    Production quantities and delivery dates must be published to AF/A5R-C, Lead MAJCOM, GACP and TMCP as necessary. 15.2.2.  This  process  identifies  the  following  FY  mandatory  munitions  movements.    The annual  MMP  is  produced  as  a  result  of  decisions  made  by  the  GAP  working  group.  Additionally,  the  working  group  validates  beddown  plans  against  movements  and  makes adjustments  as  necessary.    The  following  are  considered:    APF,  STAMP,  Operational  in-place theater stocks, CONUS stocks, test and training, delivery schedules of additional assets (legacy and new). 15.2.3.  Any  deviation  from  the  MMP  requires  a  coordinated  NAF/A4  and  MAJCOM/A5 request submitted through their unified command J-3 and J-4 to the Joint Staff J-3/J-4.  Joint Staff J-3/J-4 will staff the deviation with AF/A4 and AF/A5 for approval.  Joint Staff J-3/J-4 will return the coordinated approval/response to the applicable MAJCOM/NAF. 15.2.4.  The GACP will consolidate, publish and track action items and lessons learned from each  cycle.    They  will  in  turn  provide  status  and  related  information  to  participants throughout the year and prior to the start of each working group. 15.3.  Afloat Prepositioning Fleet (APF) Management. 15.3.1.  General.  The  AF  APF  prepositions  forward-based  munitions  cargo  in  support  of CCDRs. 15.3.1.1.  The  APF  provides  significantly  greater  deployment  flexibility  by  reducing early lift requirements and allows for rapid movement “swing-stock” of critical munitions assets from one region to another with Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) direction/priorities. 15.3.1.2.  The  APF  is  manned  and  maintained  by  civilian  mariner  crews  contracted through  the  Military  Sealift  Command  (MSC).    Vessels  require  permissive  off-loading with adequate terminal and port facilities, either afloat or ashore, to discharge explosive cargo.  Supported commands and NAFs must coordinate host nation support to expedite cargo  operations,  minimize  port  congestion,  and  move  the  forward  echelon  out  of  the seaports. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   253  15.3.1.3.  During  APF  configuration  and  load-out  operations,  except  for  Current Operations, APF has highest priority for munitions sourcing due to the limited window of availability. 15.3.2.  APF Contingency Discharge Operations. 15.3.2.1.  If  an  APF  vessel  is  approved  and  tasked  for  contingency  discharge  and apportioned  to  a  theater,  the  APF  Management  Team  will  transfer  accountability functions the  appropriate  MAJCOM/NAF  DoDAAC.  The MAJCOM/NAF munitions staff will process shipments in CAS to the ultimate consignee DoDAAC for each APF container planned for discharge. for  APF  cargo to 15.3.2.2.  Prior  to  commencing  discharge  operations,  the  theater  NAF  must  provide  the APF  Management  Team  with  a  theater  distribution  plan  identifying  the  ultimate consignee DoDAAC for each APF munitions container to be discharged. 15.3.2.3.  The  APF  Management  Team  will  deploy  a  Port  Management  Team(s)  to  the planned  Sea  Port  of  Debarkation  (SPOD)  to  manage  munitions  offload  sequence  and priorities. 15.3.2.4.  Upon completion of theater APF discharge and distribution operations, the APF Management  Team  and  the  NAF/MAJCOM  munitions  staff  will  reconcile  assets remaining  on  the  NAF/MAJCOM  DoDAAC.  Once  reconciled,  the  APF  Management Team in coordination with the NAF will transfer remaining APF assets back to the APF vessel DoDAAC. 15.3.3.  APF Peacetime Discharge Operations. 15.3.3.1.  APF  vessels  may  be  planned  for  peacetime  discharge  to  reposition  specific munitions assets  ashore in  one or  more theaters.  During  peacetime, APF assets are not apportioned to the effected theater and the APF management team ships specific assets to the ultimate consignee DoDAAC. 15.3.3.2.  Peacetime discharge of selected APF assets is done only after coordination with AF/A4LW, AF/A5R-C, and the effected theater logistics/munitions planners. 15.3.3.3.  The  APF  management  team  may  be  tasked  to  deploy  a  Port  Management Team(s)  to  coordinate  munitions  discharge  and  reconcile  assets  remaining  on  the  APF vessel. 15.3.4.  APF Apportionment. 15.3.4.1.  During peacetime, apportioned APF assets are under the operational control of the Theater Commander in whose area of responsibility the ships are located. 15.3.4.2.  For  contingency  and  crisis  action  planning,  the  JSCP  apportions  the  APF  as forces.  As apportioned in the JSCP, one or more vessels may be tasked in the OPLAN  TPFDD. 15.3.4.2.1.  TPFDD research must consider ship stowage plans, port unloading times, and  the  time  to  move  assets  from  one  theater  to  another.    Also  consider  assets available  through  other  means  such  as  CONUS  or  forward-based  swing  stocks,  and STAMP.    Approximate  fleet-sail-times  can  be  obtained  from  the  GACP  APF Management Team or APF Battlebooks.   254  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 15.3.4.2.2.  The  unified  command’s  air  component  submits  TPFDD  requirements  to the theater commander.  The theater commander validates the requirements during the execution-planning  phase  for  later  entry  into  the  theater  commander’s  validated TPFDD.    Deployment  planning  should  allow  for  flexibility  as  the  preplanned priorities sometime change in execution. 15.3.4.2.3.  During execution, actual commitment of the APF to theater commanders will  be  IAW  JCS  established  priorities.  Once  a  vessel  is  allocated,  the  Combatant Command  decides  how  to  best  utilize  the  afloat  assets  by  determining  the  offload strategy  to  meet  mission  needs.    Theater  commanders  may  address  requests  for reallocation of assets to the CJCS to be handled through the JMPAB.  Final authority to  divert  APF  vessels  requires  NCA  approval.    The  JMPAB  decides  user  priority  if more than one OPLAN is executed simultaneously. 15.3.5.  APF  Program  Responsibilities.  Operational and Maintenance activities of the Air Force APF program in support of port and theater operations will be IAW Chapter 8 and this chapter.

Posts the approved WCDO to the Air Force WRM/GM Share Point Site located on SIPRNET for the 649 MUNS. 15.5.  Theater-Prepositioned  and  CONUS-Stored  Assets.  Theater  prepositioned  assets, although an integral part of GAP, are managed by owning theater commanders in consideration of applicable Air Force positioning guidance.  CONUS stored assets can be in any one of three categories: 15.5.1.  Retail stocks assigned to CONUS base accounts. 15.5.2.  Retail stocks at AFMC depots or facilities (i.e., STAMP). 15.5.3.  Wholesale stocks at Army ammunition plants and depots.  The SMCA manages these Army depots.  Most Air Force CONUS-stored assets are at these SMCA-managed locations. 15.6.  Munitions  Transportation  Funding,  PACER  AMMO.  PACER  AMMO  is  the  official DoD nickname for the centralized funding process identifying the transportation requirements to meet MAJCOM munitions positioning objectives. 15.6.1.  AFMC/A4MW  coordinates  with  the  MAJCOM  (CONUS)  and  NAF  (OCONUS) munitions  staffs  and  is  responsible  for  monitoring  and  tracking  the  transportation  funding process  for  all  Air  Force  munitions  movements.  This  includes  CONUS  Port  Handling  and Inland  Transportation  (PHIT),  and  OCONUS  sea  and  air  costs.  OCONUS  Inland Transportation (IT) surface (truck/rail)  movements  are not paid by PACER AMMO project codes. 15.6.2.  The  NCAA  process  gathers  WRM  munitions  requirements  that  are  used  in  the development  of  the  DLAR  and  the  MMP.  The  DLAR  provides  allocations  and  positioning objectives.  15.6.2.1.  MAJCOMs  (CONUS)  and  MAJCOM/NAFs  (OCONUS)  determine  which munitions to request for call forward and retrograde based on their allocations and theater operational plans. 15.6.2.2.  Positioning objectives are determined by the GAP working groups and PCAR process  based  on  MAJCOM  (CONUS)  and  MAJCOM/NAF  (OCONUS)  priorities  and Air Force objectives as determined by the Air Staff. 15.6.3.  Surface  transportation  funding  requirements  are  identified  and  resources  are allocated to support munitions movements from the point of origin to final destination within the  CONUS;  and  to  the  OCONUS  port  of  entry,  to  include  Port  Handling  (PH).    Surface transportation  funding  requirements  for  theater  returns  and  retrograde  support  munitions movements from the port of departure, to include PH, to the final destination.  OCONUS IT is not paid by PACER AMMO project codes.   262  AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015 15.6.3.1.  The  MMP  developed  during  the  GAP  working  group  provides  the  basis  for forecasting  and  allocating  SDT  funding  for  munitions  movements.    At  a  minimum,  the MMP will include: 15.6.3.1.1.  Forecasted short tons, by command or organization (to include scheduled APF reconstitution) for each project code. 15.6.3.1.2.  Project codes 729-736 movements as the average of the previous 3 years MMP submissions. 15.6.3.1.3.  All ANG forecasted movements under project code 737. 15.6.4.  The MAJCOMs, NAFs, NGB and GACP must be active participants in the PACER AMMO  process.  GACP  with  AF/A5R-C  and/or  AF/A4LW  concurrence  will  make  final movement  determinations.  Moves  that  are  not  identified  at  the  GAP  and  included  in  the MMP require AF/A5R-C approval. 15.6.4.1.  PACER  AMMO  will  provide  the  focus  to  justify  and  advocate  funding  to preposition the worldwide munitions stockpile IAW the GAP/TAMP and MMP. 15.6.4.2.  The  MMP  will  be  costed  out  by  AFMC/A4MW  and  used  as  the  basis  for  the SDT  requirement  submission  for  munitions  moves  within  the  Air  Force.    When  SDT funds are released, the MAJCOMs will be notified of approved MMP moves.  JOHN B.

If  there  are  any  signs  of  damage  or  tampering  during  receipt  and  in  check  of SRC  I  and  II  AA&E,  and  classified  AA&E  shipments,  including  NWRM  assets,  an immediate  Special  inventory  will  be  conducted  DoDM  5100.76  to  verify  quantities received and to determine extent of any damage or tampering. (T-0). A3.4.9.  Clearing Stock Record Account Inventories: A3.4.9.1.  All  required  transactions  (inventory  counts,  recounts,  IADs,  etc.)  will  be processed to clear all annual, semi-annual, and perpetual stock record account inventories in CAS by the last day of the month in which the inventory is conducted. (T-1). A3.4.9.2.  All  required  transactions  (inventory  counts,  recounts,  IADs,  etc.)  will  be processed  to  clear  all  10-percent  and  change  of  MASO  inventories  in  CAS  within  30 calendar days of inventory start (freeze) date. (T-1). A3.4.9.3.  Administrative  or  supporting  documents  (e.g.,  inventory  packages)  for  all stock  record  account  inventories  may  be  filed  beyond  the  end  of  the  inventory month.  However,  these  documents  and  signature  approvals  will  be  obtained  and  the inventory filed within 30 calendar days of the inventory closeout date. (T-1). A3.4.9.4.  Only  process Inventory Process (AM427A) when there is no change in total asset balance as follows: location  discrepancies  during location  changes/clear the Note:   This process verifies Net Explosive Weight Quantity Distance (NEWQD)  is correct and creation of a CAS transaction audit trail for all movement “from/to” locations. A3.4.9.4.1.  Location  changes  cannot  be  updated  during  the  Inventory  Process (AM427A) unless the entire CAS quantity for a specific location is found to be in the wrong location for a specific Lot and CC.  When this condition exists, CAS processes the actual count when entered in the new location from the count sheet. A3.4.9.4.2.  If assets are counted in a structure and there is no CAS record of assets in the  structure/location  (e.g.,  not  on  the  count  sheet),  locate  the  assets  in  the  CAS generated  inventory  and  reconcile  the  inventory  to  reflect  what  the  count  team counted  in  the  CAS  indicated  location.  Then,  process  a  movement  to  the  correct location after the inventory is cleared. EXAMPLE:    If  CAS  does  not  reflect  any  assets  (0)  in  a  location  and  15  each  are  actually counted in the physical location, annotate on the count sheet what was physically counted.  Then, locate  the  CAS  specified  structure/location  for  the  15  each  assets  on  the  CAS  generated inventory  and  reconcile  to  clear  the  inventory.    Then,  process  a  movement  for  15  each  to  the proper CAS location after the inventory is cleared. AFI21-201  3 JUNE 2015   311  A3.4.9.4.3.  If  the  CAS  specified  location  is  actually  ‘split’  between  two  or  more locations, the actual locations must be updated after the inventory is cleared. EXAMPLE:    If  CAS  reflects  15  each  in  a  location,  10  each  are  counted  in  the  CAS  specified location, and 5 each are counted at a different CAS location, annotate on the count sheet(s) what was physically counted.  Then, enter 15 in the CAS specified location to clear the inventory and process a movement for 5 to the proper CAS location after the inventory is cleared. A3.4.9.5.  Movements processed using the CAS Movement Process (AM104A) to correct asset  locations  when  no  overall  balance  discrepancy  exists  does  not  require  an  IAD package. A3.4.10.  Stock  Record  Account  Inventory  Discrepancies.  All  stock  record  account inventory discrepancies shall be evaluated as follows: A3.4.10.1.  If discrepancies exist after the first count, a recount will be conducted. (T-1). Include checks of the following areas: A3.4.10.1.1.  The inspection/maintenance bay. A3.4.10.1.2.

If  discrepancies  still  exist  after  performing  the  above  actions,  a  second recount shall be conducted with the addition of verifying “LITE” box contents. (T-1). A3.4.10.3.  If  discrepancies  exist  after  the  second  recount,  perform  the  following procedures: A3.4.10.3.1.  Process  a  transaction  history  on  the  affected  NSN  back  to  the  Date  of Last Inventory (DOLI). A3.4.10.3.2.  Collect all documents currently out of file and movement control forms for affected NSN, lot, or S/N. A3.4.10.3.3.  Compare  source/input  documentation  against  all  transactions  reflected on the transaction history beginning from the DOLI. A3.4.10.3.4.  Compare all movement control forms against transaction history. A3.4.10.3.5.  Research all custody accounts with the same NSN. A3.4.10.3.6.  Verify assets are not pending transportation. A3.4.10.4.  If  the  discrepancy  still  can’t  be  resolved,  the  MASO  must  initiate  inventory adjustment procedures IAW paragraph 7.14. (T-1). A3.4.11.  Documenting Stock Record Account Inventories. A3.4.11.1.  All  stock  record  account  inventories  will  be  documented  on  an  inventory results  memorandum.  (T-1).

Purpose:  This attachment provides FISCAM user access controls to CAS and aligns CAS User Roles and Duty Functions to specific authorized Program Identification (ID) within Tables A6.1, A6.2, A6.3, and A6.4.  This table will be used in conjunction with paragraph 2.6.6 and paragraph  9.2.1 when completing CAS - DD Forms 2875 to assign CAS User Roles to individual personnel. (T-1). Note:  It is not necessary to enter specific Program IDs on the DD Form 2875. A6.2.  User  Roles  and  Functions:  CAS  User  Roles  and  Functions  are  not  associated  to  specific  workcenters  (e.g.,  Inspection, Storage, PGM, CMM).  Rather, User Roles and Functions are based on the tasks that specific personnel are qualified and required to perform to meet local mission requirements as determined by Munitions Supervision and/or the MASO.  For this reason, supervisors, managers, SAs, and MASOs should not use workcenter assignment as the primary basis for assigning User Roles on the CAS  - DD Form 2875. Table A6.1.
