However, this procedure is designed  to  see  that  any  safety  device  operates  correctly  as  air  pressure  drops  from normal to a low air condition.  For safety purposes, in areas where an incline is present, the operator will use wheel chocks during the air brake check.  The proper procedures for inspecting the air brake system are as follows:  5.2.3.2.7.1.  With the air pressure built up to governor cutoff (120 – 140 pounds per square inch (psi)), shut off the engine, chock the wheels if necessary, release the parking brake (all vehicles) and fully apply the foot brake.  Hold the foot brake for one minute.  Check the air gauge to see if the air pressure drops more than three pounds in one minute (single vehicle).  5.2.3.2.7.2.  Without  re-starting  the  engine,  turn  electrical  power  to  the  “on”  or “battery charge” position.  Begin fanning off the air pressure by rapidly applying and releasing the foot brake.  Low air warning devices (buzzer, light, flag) should activate  before  air  pressure  drops  below  60  psi  or  level  specified  by  the manufacturer.  5.2.3.2.7.3.  Continue  to  fan  off  the  air  pressure.    On  single  vehicle  types,  the parking brake valve should close (pop-out).  5.2.3.2.8.   Start auxiliary engine.  CAUTION:  Do not run pump dry.  5.2.3.2.9.   Sounds, vibrations, odors, leaks.  5.2.3.2.10.  Sign  AF  Form  1800.    Verify  Standard  Form  (SF)  91,  Motor  Vehicle Accident Report and Department of Defense (DD) Form 518, Accident Identification Card are on-hand.  5.2.3.3.  Post-opertion inspection.  5.2.3.3.1.   Check fuel level (<3/4 tank, refuel).  5.2.3.3.2.   Ensure vehicle and components are cleaned.   5.2.3.3.3.   Park vehicle.  Ensure transmission in neutral, apply parking brake. 5.2.3.3.4.   Engine cool down (3-5 minutes).  Shut off lights and accessories.    5.2.3.3.5.   Drain air tanks. 5.2.3.3.6.   Post-operation 360 walk-around inspection.  Check for leaks and damage. 5.2.3.3.7.

The following are safety items and procedures to be followed during sweeper operations.  The manufacturer’s operator’s manual will also provide safe  operating  procedures  and  the  vehicle  itself  may  have  warnings,  cautions  and  danger stickers that the vehicle operator should be aware of.  5.4.1.1.  Vehicle data plate.  Be familiar with the location and information found on the data plate.  5.4.1.2.  Plan the route.  5.4.1.2.1.   Overhead clearance.  Check the clearance height of the vehicle relative to the overhead obstructions such as power lines, trees, and bridges.  5.4.1.2.2.   Width restrictions/construction zones, over-the-road.     5.4.1.2.3.   Weight restriction (roads, bridges, off-road conditions). 5.4.1.2.4.   Inclines. 5.4.1.2.5.   Uneven ground. 5.4.1.2.6.   Soft surfaces.  5.4.2.  Over the road operation.  5.4.2.1.  Greater vehicle weight.  The operator needs to consider the combined weight of the water truck (distributor) and the load.  This will affect the following:  5.4.2.1.1.   Operator’s ability to stop.  Do not tailgate the vehicle in front.  Allow more distance between vehicles in order to increase reaction time.  5.4.2.1.2.   Vehicle’s  ability  to  accelerate/follow  the  flow  of  traffic.    Accelerate smoothly  and  gradually  so  the  truck  does  not  jerk.    Rough  acceleration  causes unnecessary, premature mechanical damage to the truck’s drive train.  Maintain a safe speed (typically 5 miles per hour (mph) below the posted speed limit).  5.4.2.2.  Downgrades/upgrades.    The  operator  will  use  lower  gears  more  frequently  to climb hills or mountains with increasing grade steepness, length and/or heavy load weight.  Plan ahead to  identify downgrades/upgrades on the route of travel.    When encountering downgrades/upgrades as described, the operator will need to address:  5.4.2.2.1.   Speed.  On downgrades, gravity causes the speed of the vehicle to increase.  The operator must select an appropriate safe speed, use a low gear, and proper braking techniques.  The operator must go slow enough so as to not overheat the truck brakes.  5.4.2.2.2.   Stopping.    If  the  brakes  become  too  hot,  they  may  start  to  “fade”.    This means the operator will need to apply the brakes harder and harder to acquire equivalent stopping power.  5.4.2.3.  Sharp turns.  Slow down before entering the turn.  During the turn, avoid sharp sudden movements with the steering wheel.  This reduces the chance of shifting the load in  the tank, and also  prevents  the possibility of tipping over due to  the higher center of gravity.  5.4.2.4.  Surroundings.    Operating  a  water  truck  (distributor)  requires  the  operator’s constant attention.  Many situations can be avoided by simply paying close attention to the surrounding  conditions.    Road  signs  such  as  “steep  grade”,  “low  overhead  clearance”, “sharp turn ahead”, and special speed limits are posted for the driver’s safety.  5.4.2.5.  Size.  The operator must take into account, the water truck (distributor) and load when operating the vehicle.  5.4.3.  Backing.  5.4.3.1.  Always use a trained spotter and hand signals.  5.4.3.2.  Back slowly and keep the spotter in view at all times.  If the operator loses sight of the spotter, the operator must immediately stop the vehicle.  5.4.3.3.  See AFMAN 24-306 for standard AF spotter hand signals and additional guidance on spotter safety.  5.4.4.  Water truck (distributor) filling operations.  5.4.4.1.  Fire  hydrant,  fill  stand  and  drafting.    Ensure  three  points-of-contact  when climbing on/off the fill stand platform and/or truck.  5.4.4.2.  Be aware of pinch hazards when connecting hoses.  5.4.4.3.  Ensure transmission is in neutral, apply parking brake.  5.4.4.4.  Fill on a level surface, if possible.  5.4.5.  Towing operations.  5.4.5.1.  Proper trailer size for load capacity.  5.4.5.2.  Proper pintle hook/lunette size for trailer/load.  5.4.5.3.  Set safety pin.  5.4.5.4.  Connect air, lights and safety chains.  5.4.5.5.  Secure landing gear.  5.4.5.6.  Always use a spotter.  5.4.5.7.  Trailer will off-track when being pulled.  5.4.6.   Tire changing safety.  5.4.6.1.  Consider  where  the  vehicle  is  located.    If  on  a  bridge,  curve,  road  with  no shoulder, etc.; it is safer to move a vehicle on a flat tire to a safe location.  5.4.6.2.  Find a location with a firm and level surface for the jack and jack stand.  5.4.6.3.  Turn on the four-way flashers.  5.4.6.4.  Set parking brake.  5.4.6.5.  Place warning triangles or flares.  5.4.6.6.  Block the wheels.  If changing a front tire, block the rear wheels.  If changing a rear tire, block the front wheels.  5.4.6.7.  As required, place dunnage or cribbage under the jack and jack stand.  CAUTION:    Notify  VCO/VCNCO,  the  supervisor,  and/or  vehicle  maintenance  if  split  rim requires servicing.  5.5. Vehicle Operation.  5.5.1.  General vehicle operations.  5.5.1.1.  Complete a pre-operation vehicle inspection.  5.5.1.2.  Sign the current AF Form 1800.  5.5.1.3.  Use three points of contact when climbing into the vehicle..  5.5.1.4.  Adjust the seat and mirrors as needed; fasten seat belt.  5.5.2.  Starting the vehicle.  5.5.2.1.  To start the vehicle, ensure the parking brake is  set and the gear selection is in neutral.  5.5.2.2.  Turn the ignition key to the ON position.  If the vehicle is equipped with a starter button press and release the button once the engines starts.  CAUTION:  Do not engage the starter for more than 10 seconds.  5.5.2.3.  Wait 10 to 15 seconds before reengaging the starter again if the truck  does not start on the first try.  5.5.2.4.  Trucks  equipped  with  a  cold  weather  starting  aid  should  only  be  used  when temperatures are colder than 35°F.  5.5.2.5.  Once  the  engine  starts,  monitor  the  gauges  to  make  sure  they  are  functioning properly.  5.5.3.  Moving the water truck (distributor).  5.5.3.1.  Before placing the vehicle in motion, ensure the doors are closed and everyone has their seat belt on.  5.5.3.2.  Check air brake pressure and make sure it is in the operating range of at least 90 psi.  5.5.3.3.  Refer to Section 5.2. for information on low air pressure warnings.  5.5.3.4.  Place foot on the brake, select the appropriate gear.  5.5.3.5.  Make sure to check traffic conditions before pulling out.  5.5.3.6.  Refer to Section 5.4. for safety operations of the water truck distributor.  5.5.4.  Pump operations.  Refer to the manufacturer’s operator’s manual for pump engine and spray assembly operation guidance.  5.5.5.  End of duty day.  5.5.5.1.

Release the parking brakes so the operator can move the slack adjusters. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that it can be reached. Check slack adjuster, more than 1-inch indicates adjustments required (vehicles with too much brake slack can be very hard to stop).  Adjust it or have it adjusted. Check brake drums (or discs), linings, and hoses. Test low pressure warning signal. Shut the engine off when the vehicle has enough air pressure so that the low pressure warning signal is not on. Turn the electrical power on. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce air tank pressure. Low air pressure warning signal should come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank with lowest pressure. Check that the spring brakes come on automatically. Chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes when enough air pressure is built up. Shut the engine off. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce the air tank pressure. o  o o "Parking brake" knob should pop out when the air pressure falls to the manufacturer's specification. Check rate of air pressure buildup Refer to manufacturer’s recommendation for average buildup time. If not within recommended time, the air pressure may drop too low during driving operations. Test air leakage rate.  o  With a fully-charged air system (typically 125 psi). Turn-off the engine. Release the service brake and time the air pressure drop. The loss rate should be less than 2 psi in one minute for single vehicles. Not less than 3 psi in 1 minute for combination vehicles. Then apply 90 psi or more with the brake pedal. After the initial pressure drop, if the air pressure falls more than 3 psi in 1 minute for single vehicles. Not more than 4 psi for combination vehicles. Check air compressor governor cut-in and cut-out pressures. Air compressor should start at about 100 psi and stop at about 125 psi. Run the engine at a fast idle. Air governor should cut-out the air compressor at about the manufacturer's specified pressure. Engine idling, step on and off brake to reduce air tank pressure. Compressor should cut-in at manufacturer's specified cut-in pressure. Test parking brake:  Stop the vehicle; put the parking brake on; gently pull against it in low gear to determine if parking brake will hold. Test service brakes. o o  Wait for normal air pressure.   Release the parking brake. Move the vehicle forward slowly (about 5 mph). Apply the brakes firmly using the brake pedal. o o o o  o o  o o o o o o    Note any vehicle "pulling" to one side, unusual feel, or delayed stopping action.
