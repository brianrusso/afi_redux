Follow the format for Air Force Casualty Reports and report all applicable items. 2.5.2.  Precede each item in the remarks by its plain text title so the member's Service, which may not follow the same procedures, can understand the data.  Do not use abbreviations. 2.6.  Reporting Casualties on Foreign Nationals in the United States under the Auspices of the Air Force: 2.6.1.  The reporting installation provides AFPC/DPFCS with the orders-issuing headquarters of the appropriate nation’s military as an action addressee.  If the foreign casualty is assigned as part of the Military Personnel Exchange Program, AFPC/DPFCS will include SAF/IAPA as  an  action  addressee.    SAF/IAPA  will  coordinate  NOK  notification  and  disposition  of remains with the appropriate foreign embassy. 2.6.2.  If the order-issuing headquarters is unknown, AFPC/DPFCS will send the report to a Military  Assistance  Advisory  Group  (MAAG)  or  Defense  Attaché  Office  (DAO)  in  the foreign national's home country. 2.6.3.  If the CAR is unaware of the order-issuing headquarters or a MAAG or DAO in the foreign national’s home country, call these offices to obtain the information: 2.6.3.1.  Headquarters,  United  States  Air  Force,  Foreign  Liaison  Division  (HQ AF/CVAI), DSN 225-2251. 2.6.3.2.  The Air Force Service Watch Cell, DSN 227-6103, after duty hours. 2.6.4.

The Air Force requires reports on all casualties resulting from a military or CMA aircraft incident or disappearance. 2.7.1.2.  The CAR/PERSCO must account for all personnel aboard the aircraft.  (T-1). 34 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 2.7.1.3.  The  proper  reporting  method  depends  on  the  nature  of  the  incident  and  the number of casualties.  In all incidents, immediately contact  AFPC/DPFCS by telephone to determine which method(s) to use: 2.7.1.3.1.  Report casualties immediately by telephone followed by a Casualty Report. 2.7.1.3.2.  If  there  are  multiple  casualties,  make  an  initial  report  by  telephone  and follow  it  with      the  Casualty  Reports  using  the  Multiple  Casualty  Incident  tab  as outlined in the Air Force DCIPS User Guides. 2.7.2.  The  following  documents  and  sources  of  information  can  assist  in  determining onboard crew and passengers. 2.7.2.1.  DD Form 175,  Military Flight  Plan,  lists the name, grade, SSN, crew position, and home installation of each crew member. 2.7.2.2.  Passengers: 2.7.2.2.1.

Consult passenger service terminals, base operations, flight control centers at  civilian  airports,  and  AMC  Aerial  Port  Operations  offices  for  information  on passengers aboard military aircraft. 2.7.2.3.  If difficulties are encountered in obtaining the information, immediately contact AFPC/DPFCS  by  telephone  and  they  will  request  assistance  from  HQ  AMC  Tanker Airlift Control Center, Aerial  Port Control Center (HQ AMC  TACC/XOGC, DSN 576-1755). 2.7.3.  Release of Casualty Information: Crew and passenger names, and any other releasable information  that  would  assist  commanders  in  making  casualty  determinations,  will  be immediately  released  to  the  CAR/PERSCO.    Unit  commanders  must  be  able  to  determine casualty status  of their personnel  using the information.    See the local  SJA if there are  any questions.  See PA release paragraph  1.17. 2.8.  Reporting  Casualties  on  DoD  and  DAF  Civilian  Employees.  (See  Table  1.1.,  Table 2.2., and Table 2.3.) 2.8.1.  The  Air  Force  requires  reports  on  DoD  and  DAF  civilian  employees  in  certain circumstances.  Refer to Table 1.1. for guidance. 2.8.2.  Upon notification of the death from CPS, submit an initial report using DCIPS-CR or DCIPS-CF as outlined in the Air Force DCIPS User Guides. Section 2B—Reports on Deceased Persons 2.9.  Obtaining Conclusive Evidence of Death. 2.9.1.  Unit  commander(s)  must  obtain  conclusive  evidence  of  death  before  reporting  the death  of an individual  IAW paragraph    1.9.    If  an incident  involves members of more than one  unit  or  service,  commanders  must  coordinate  and  agree  in  death  determination.    If commanders cannot reach an agreement, consult AFPC/DPFCS.   (T-1). AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 35 2.9.2.  The Air Force does not require recovery of remains for conclusive evidence of death because  situations  will  arise  where  remains  cannot  be  recovered,  but  where  the  chance  of survival  is  deemed  impossible.    The  important  factor  is  whether  or  not  the  commander determines that survival is possible. 2.9.2.1.  The  Air  Force  considers  the  following  situations  to  be  conclusive  evidence  of death: 2.9.2.1.1.  The commander determines death is the only plausible explanation for the member’s absence. 2.9.2.1.1.1.  Available information indicates beyond any reasonable doubt that an individual could not have survived. Such information includes: 2.9.2.1.1.1.1.  Statements of witnesses to the incident. 2.9.2.1.1.1.2.  Circumstances of the incident. 2.9.2.1.1.1.3.  Search results. 2.9.2.1.1.1.4.  Local  conditions  of currents, etc. terrain,  climate,  water temperature, 2.9.2.1.2.  The  total  number  of  individuals’  remains  recovered  from  an  incident equals the total number of persons known to be involved in the incident, unless there is reasonable doubt as to whether the remains are from the incident in question. 2.10.  Local  Laws  Governing  Brain  Death.  The CAR must be aware of local laws governing brain death.  (T-0). Section 2C—Reports on Members Declared DUSTWUN or Persons Declared Missing (Non-Hostile and Hostile) 2.11.  Declaring a Member DUSTWUN. 2.11.1.  DUSTWUN is a transitory casualty status applicable only to military personnel. 2.11.2.  The responsible unit or TDY commander declares a member DUSTWUN when the commander: 2.11.2.1.  Suspects  a  member's  absence  is  involuntary  and  that  the  member  may  be  a casualty. 2.11.2.2.  Does not feel there is sufficient evidence to make a definitive determination of missing  (non-hostile),  recommendation  of  missing  (hostile),  or  deceased.    DUSTWUN allows  the  commander  time  to  gather  additional  facts  and  statements  from  witnesses  in order  to  make  a  definitive  status  determination  (non-hostile)  or  recommendation  of missing (hostile). 2.11.3.  Once  a  commander  declares  a  military  member  DUSTWUN,  the  CAR  submits  an initial DUSTWUN Report to the addressees in Table 2.1. or Table 2.2.  2.11.4.  Generally, commanders may not keep a member in DUSTWUN status for more than 10 days, unless extended by AFPC/DPFCS.  During this period, the commander: 36 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 2.11.4.1.  Closely  monitors  the  case  and  makes  every  effort  to  determine  the  member's true status. 2.11.4.2.  Receives the results of any search and investigative efforts. 2.11.4.3.  Submits daily Search Progress Reports (see paragraph  2.15.) to the addressees in Table 2.1. or Table 2.2.  2.12.  Factors  Commanders  Should  Consider  in  Determining  Whether  a  Member's Absence is Voluntary or Involuntary. 2.12.1.  Member’s relationship with others both on and off duty: 2.12.1.1.  Marital discord. 2.12.1.2.  Problems with supervisors or coworkers. 2.12.2.  Financial activities prior to or subsequent to disappearance: 2.12.2.1.  Recent large withdrawals from bank accounts. 2.12.2.2.  Use of credit cards for airline tickets, hotels, or gas. 2.12.3.  Evidence of departure preparations: 2.12.3.1.  Luggage or personal belongings missing from the member's residence. 2.12.3.2.  Remarks made by the member to friends, relatives, or coworkers hinting at the possibility of a departure. 2.12.4.  Under investigation for violation of UCMJ or has any actions pending on a previous voluntary absence (i.e., AWOL or Deserter). 2.13.  Examples of When it May be Appropriate to Declare a Member DUSTWUN. 2.13.1.  An  aircraft  is  overdue  and  the  responsible  commander  has  made  an  initial investigation, to include the following, with negative results: 2.13.1.1.  Checks of scheduled stops along route. 2.13.1.2.  Possible emergency landing sites. 2.13.1.3.  Other places the aircraft may have landed. 2.13.2.  A  member  disappears  while  participating  in  a  recreational  activity  such  as  hunting, fishing, swimming, hiking, or camping: 2.13.2.1.  The  member's  commander  initiates  a  search  for  the  absent  member  and investigates the circumstances surrounding the member’s disappearance. 2.13.2.1.1.  The search must be sufficiently extensive for the commander to determine whether the member could freely return. 2.13.2.1.2.  May  include  Security  Forces,  local  police,  Air  Force  Office  of  Special Investigations  (AFOSI),  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI),  and  other investigative agencies. 2.13.3.  Initial attempts to find the member failed and the commander determines the member is not AWOL. AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 37 2.13.4.  A  member  observes  a  lead  aircraft  as  it  is  hit  by  enemy  ground  fire.    Before  the aircraft  hits  the  ground,  the  member  observes  a  flash,  possibly  from  a  seat  ejection.  Hostilities preclude launching a search and rescue attempt. 2.13.5.  A member disappears and there are no known circumstances: 2.13.5.1.  Personal  belongings  such  as  military  ID  card,  wallet,  car  keys,  checkbook, passport, camera, television set, savings bonds, etc., are still in member’s dormitory room or private residence. 2.13.5.2.  First  sergeant,  supervisor  and  coworkers  believe  voluntary  absence  would  be out of character for the member. 2.14.  CAR Responsibilities for Filing DUSTWUN and Subsequent Reports. 2.14.1.  Once a commander declares a military member DUSTWUN: 2.14.1.1.  Immediately  telephone  AFPC/DPFCS  and  advise  them  of  the  commander’s decision.  (T-1). 2.14.1.2.

Ensures  the  CAR/PERSCO  submits  the  appropriate  Casualty  Report  IAW paragraph  2.14.  2.16.  Declaring a Person Missing (Non-Hostile). 2.16.1.  This casualty status applies to both military members and DoD civilian personnel, as applicable. 2.16.2.  When  a  commander  determines  that  a  person's  absence  is  involuntary  and  there  is insufficient evidence to declare the person deceased, the commander: 2.16.2.1.  Consults with AFPC/DPFCM by telephone prior to declaring a person missing or submitting a Missing Report.  (T-1). 2.16.2.2.  After  consulting  with  AFPC/DPFCM,  the  commander  declares  the  person missing  (see  Attachment  1)  and  has  the  CAR  submit  an  initial  Missing  Report  (see paragraph  2.17.).  (T-1). 2.16.3.  Declaring  a  member  missing  (non-hostile)  automatically  invokes  the  statutory provisions of 37 U.S.C., Chapter 10, Payments to Missing Persons, for military, or 5 U.S.C. Sections 5565 and 5566 for civilians. 2.16.3.1.  Once  the  commander  declares  a  person  missing  and  notifies  the  NOK, AFPC/DPFCM  must  issue  any  further  official  correspondence  to  the  NOK,  including notifications  of  a  change  in  casualty  status  to  deceased.

Declares the person missing. 2.16.4.2.  Terminates the search for the person. 2.17.  Declaring a Person Missing (Hostile). 2.17.1.  This  casualty  status  applies  to  military  members,  DoD  civilian  employees,  or  DoD contractor employees.  Commanders may only make a recommendation for missing when the member’s absence is under hostile circumstances. 2.17.2.  In those circumstances where the reason for a member’s absence is uncertain and it is possible  that  the  member  is  a  casualty  whose  absence  is  involuntary,  but  there  is  not sufficient  evidence  to  determine  immediately  that  the  member  is  missing  or  deceased,  the member  should  be  designated  DUSTWUN  (military)  (paragraphs    2.11.  through    2.15.)  or EAWUN (civilian). 40 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 2.17.2.1.  The  commander  of  the  unit,  facility,  or  area  to  or  in  which  the  person  is assigned makes a preliminary assessment of the circumstances to determine whether the involuntary  absence  is  a  result  of  hostile  action  or  under  circumstances  suggesting  that the involuntary absence is a result of hostile action.  (T-1). 2.17.2.2.  If,  as  a  result  of  that  assessment,  the  commander  concludes  that  the  person  is missing, the commander submits a preliminary assessment and recommendation. 2.17.2.2.1.  Recommend  the  person  be  placed  in  a  missing  status  using  DD  Form 2812,  Commander’s  Preliminary  Assessment  and  Recommendation  Regarding Missing  Person,  (see  DoDI  2310.05,  Accounting  for  Missing  Persons-Boards  of Inquiry, Enclosure 3).  (T-1). 2.17.2.2.2.  Not  later  than  10  days  after  receiving  such  information,  transmit  a Missing Report containing that recommendation to AFPC/DPFCM with an advisory copy  to  the  theater  component  commander  having  jurisdiction  over  the  missing person.

To apply for the unpaid pay and allowances, the FSO completes an SF 1174, Claim for Unpaid Compensation of Deceased Member of the Uniformed Services, and provides it to the CAR.  The CAR presents the form to the beneficiary(ies) for signature(s) (refer to Table 4.2).  (T-1). 4.11.3.  DFAS-IN initiates a CMS case on all active duty status deaths.  The CAR provides the  claim  form  and  supporting  documentation  to  the  FSO  who  scans  and  uploads  the documents into the CMS case.  (T-1). 4.11.4.  When  the  unpaid  pay  and  allowances  are  divided,  the  base  with  primary  assistance responsibility submits all claim forms.  (T-1). 4.12.  Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH).  Eligible dependents of deceased active duty status members (who are receiving BAH) are entitled to 365-days of housing allowance or to remain in government quarters up to 365-days.  If dependent(s) occupying government housing choose to vacate  government  housing prior to  the 365th  day  following the member’s death,  BAH will be paid for the remaining unused days. 4.12.1.  When  unpaid  pay  and  allowances  are  paid  to  a  person  other  than  the  member’s spouse, the CAR completes a separate SF 1174 to apply for the BAH on behalf of the spouse. 4.12.2.

NOTE:  DFAS-IN  will  not  release  Arrears  of  Pay (AOP)/BAH without the completed Casualty Checklist.   4.13.  Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP).  SBP is a monthly annuity paid by the Air Force via EFT to the  surviving  spouse  or,  in  some  cases,  eligible  children  of  a  member  who  dies  on  active  duty status  in  the  LOD.  The  annuity is  equal  to  55 percent  of the retired pay to  which the member would  have  been  entitled  as  if  retired  for  total  disability  on  the  date  of  death.    The  spouse’s annuity is reduced by the amount of the monthly DIC payment awarded and paid to the surviving spouse by the VA.  The annuity is paid until the spouse dies, but is suspended upon remarriage before age 55.  The annuity to a surviving spouse may be reinstated if the subsequent marriage ends in death or divorce.  The annuitant must send a certified copy of the divorce decree or death certificate to DFAS-CL (Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U.S. Military Annuitant Pay, 1240  East  9th  Street,  Cleveland,  OH  44199-2005)  to  reinstate  the  annuity.    If  a  second  SBP benefit  resulted  from  the  remarriage,  the  surviving  spouse  must  elect  which  of  the  two  SBP benefits  to  receive.  Should  the surviving spouse remarry at  age 55 or older, the annuitant  will continue  to  receive  the  monthly  annuity.    The  surviving  spouse  must  notify  DFAS  of  any changes in marital status.  See AFI 36-3006 for additional information. AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 77 4.13.1.  The CAR faxes the claim forms and any supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.2 to DFAS-CL at 1-800-982-8459.  (T-1). 4.13.2.  For  active  duty  status  deaths,  when  the  member  is  survived  by  both  a  spouse  and child(ren), contact AFPC/DPFFF (SBP Branch) at DSN 665-2273 for guidance in processing steps to establish appropriate annuity. 4.13.2.1.  AFPC/DPFFF processes the active duty status claim when the surviving spouse requests SAF waive spouse’s SBP in favor of the member’s children.  All required SBP documentation/forms is forwarded to AFPC/DPFFF.  (T-1). 4.13.3.  The  surviving  spouse  must  request  SAF  pay  SBP  to  either  the  spouse  or  the child(ren).  All required SBP documentation/forms must be forwarded to AFPC Sustainment Support Branch (AFPC/DP1SS). 4.13.3.1.  CAR ensures the surviving spouse is properly counseled on his or her options regarding the receipt of SBP annuity for both spouse and child only coverage.  (T-1). 4.13.4.  The CAR ensures the claim is processed and the annuity established prior to closing out  the  case.    (T-1).    In  some  cases,  the  VA  DIC  entitlement  will  totally  offset  the  SBP annuity.  However, an annuity must be established regardless of the amount.  There is a six-year  statute  of  limitations  on  filing  an  SBP  claim.    If  a  claim  is  not  established  within  six years, there is no legal basis for establishing the claim.  This is particularly important in cases when  the  VA  DIC  completely  offsets  the  SBP  annuity  and  the  surviving  spouse  remarries after  age  55  but  before  age  57  when  he  or  she  loses  DIC  entitlement,  but  the  SBP  annuity may be reinstated. 4.13.4.1.  ARC  members  who  die  in  and  IDT  status,  in  the  line  of  duty  are  eligible for RCSBP not SBP.  Refer to AFI 36-3006. 4.14.  Reserve  Component  Survivor  Benefit  Plan  (RCSBP).  RCSBP  is  a  monthly  annuity paid  by  the  Air  Force  to  the  surviving  spouse  or,  in  some  cases,  eligible  children  of  an  AFR member who dies and has completed the satisfactory years of service to qualify the member for retired pay at age 60.  The member must have made an election within 90 days of notification of eligibility to participate in the program.  Members on an active Guard/Reserve 10211 (officer) or 12310 (enlisted) tour, are eligible to participate in the plan.  Coverage is not automatic unless the member dies before the 90-day period established by law.  The initial annuity paid to a surviving spouse is equal to 55 percent of the retired pay to which the member would have been entitled to at age 60, reduced by the Reserve Portion Cost.  See AFI 36-3006 for additional information. 4.14.1.  If the member meets the eligibility requirements, fax the claim forms and supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.2., to DFAS-CL.  (T-1). 4.14.2.  If  the  CAR  does  not  have  access,  contact  the  base  FSO  to  check  on  the  payment status of the RCSBP annuity prior to checking with DFAS.  (T-1). 4.15.  Montgomery  GI  Bill  Death  Benefit.  The  VA  will  pay  a  special  Montgomery  GI  Bill death benefit to a designated survivor in the event of the service-connected death of an individual while on active duty status.  Service connection is determined by the VA using an AF Form 348.  The deceased must either have been entitled to educational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill program or a participant in the program.  The amount paid will be equal to the participant’s actual military pay reduction less any education benefits paid.  If the member contributed to this 78 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 program, the designated SGLI beneficiary may be entitled to the death benefit.  The death benefit is paid to whoever is designated to receive the member’s SGLI. To apply for the death benefit, the CAR should submit a letter or a Support of Claim along with the member’s SGLI certificate (SGLV 8286), and  a  copy of the DD Form 1300  Report  of  Casualty and AF  348  Line  of  Duty Determination,  as  listed  in  Table  4.2.  to  the  VARO,  St.  Louis  Regional  Processing  Officer, ATTN: Chapter 30, Montgomery GI Bill, PO Box 66830, 331/225, St. Louis MO 63103-6830.  See Attachment 1, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Benefits for Veterans and Dependents,  and  Survivors,  for  additional  information.    Any  changes  in  benefits  due  to  the inception  of  the  Post  9/11  GI  Bill  will  be  posted  on  the  Casualty  Share  Point  Site  at: https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-DP-00-60/AFKN_Docs/Forms/AllItems.aspx. 4.16.  Dependency  and Indemnity  Compensation  (DIC).  DIC is payable via EFT by the VA to  surviving spouses, unmarried children under age 18, disabled children, children between the ages of 18 and 23 if attending a VA-approved school, and low-income parents of members who die from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated while on AD or ADT, an injury incurred or aggravated in  the line of duty  while on  IDT, or  a disability otherwise  compensable under laws administered  by  the  VA.    DIC  is  not  paid  if  the  VA  determines  that  the  member’s  own misconduct  contributed  to  the  death.    DIC  paid  to  a  surviving  spouse  is  not  based  on  the member’s  military  pay  grade.    The  amount  paid  for  a  spouse  with  one  or  more  children  of  the deceased  is  increased  for  each  child.    The  amount  of  the  DIC  payment  for  parents  varies according  to  the  number  of  parents,  the  amount  of  their  individual  or  combined  total  annual income, and whether they live together or, if remarried, live with a spouse.  DIC payments to a surviving  spouse  are  payable  for  life,  as  long  as  the  spouse  does  not  remarry  prior  to  age  57.  Should  the  surviving  spouse  remarry,  payments  are  terminated,  but  may  be  restored  if  the subsequent  marriage  ends  in  death,  divorce,  or  annulment.    See  Attachment  1,  the  U.S. Department  of Veterans  Affairs,  Federal  Benefits for Veterans and Dependents,  and Survivors, for additional information.  CARs are required to apply for DIC benefits in ALL death cases and ensure claims are submitted within one year of the death.  (T-1). 4.16.1.  To  apply  for  DIC,  the  CAR  should  complete  the  appropriate  claim  application  as listed in Table 4.2.  (T-1). 4.16.2.  Fax  the  original  claim  application  and  copies  of  any  supporting  documentation  to (215) 381-3084, the VA Regional Office, P. O. Box 7208, Philadelphia, PA 19101.  (T-1). 4.17.  Non-Service-Connected  Death  Pension.  If  the  VARO  determines  that  the  NOK  is  not eligible  for  DIC,  they  may  be  eligible  to  apply  for  a  non-service-connected  death  pension. Surviving spouses of deceased members with wartime service and unmarried children under age 18, or age 23 if attending a VA-approved school, may be eligible for this pension if they meet income limitations prescribed by law.  Qualifying children who become incapable of self-support because of a disability before age 18 may be eligible for a pension as long as the condition exists unless  the  child  marries  or  the  child’s  income  exceeds  the  income  limit.    The  rate  of  pension depends on the amount of income the surviving spouse or child receives from other sources.  A pension  is  not  payable  to  those  whose  estates  are  so  large  that  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  the estate will maintain them financially.  The VA will determine their eligibility. See  Attachment 1, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Benefits for Veterans and Dependents, and Survivors, for additional information. AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 79 4.17.1.  Eligible  survivors  should  visit  their  local  VA  office  to  complete  the  appropriate claim application with the supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.2.  4.18.  Servicemembers’  Group  Life  Insurance  (SGLI).  The  SGLI  payment  is  the  maximum allowable  by  law,  unless  the  member  elected  a  lesser  amount  or  declined  coverage  in  writing.  Monthly premium payments for the level of coverage selected by the member are automatically deducted from the member’s pay.  The OSGLI  under the jurisdiction of the Department of VA makes determination and payment of proceeds.  The claim form required to apply for this benefit is VA Form SGLV 8283.  Payment of proceeds to a beneficiary is  exempt from taxation.  The insured  member  may  have  designated  as  principal  or  contingent  beneficiary  any  person,  firm, corporation or legal  entity, including his/her estate, individually or as a trustee.   If the member designated a trust, he/she indicated the name and date of the trust in the beneficiary block.  If the member  designated  a  trust  through  a  will,  he/she  annotated  “Last  Will  and  Testament”  in  the beneficiary block.  If the member chose not to designate a specific beneficiary, but preferred the proceeds be paid in the order of precedence, the member selected the “By Law” designation. 4.18.1.  When the “By Law” designation is used, the proceeds are automatically paid in the following order of precedence: 4.18.1.1.  The member’s lawful surviving spouse. 4.18.1.2.  The child(ren) of the member in equal shares, with the shares of any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that child. 4.18.1.3.  The parents of the member in equal shares or to the surviving parent. 4.18.1.4.  The duly appointed legal representative of the member’s estate. 4.18.1.5.  If none of the above, to the person(s) determined to be entitled under the laws of the state in which the member was domiciled. 4.18.2.  See  paragraph    8.6.  and  U.S.  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs,  H-29-98-01, Servicemembers’ and Veterans’ Group Life Insurance Handbook, for additional information. 4.18.3.  To  apply  for  the  SGLI  benefit,  the  CAR  should  complete  the  required  claim  form listed in Table 4.2.  (T-1). 4.18.4.  Fax the claim form and a copy of the initial DD1300 to OSGLI at 1-877-832-4943.  (T-1). 4.18.5.  Upload the form and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in Table 4.2. into DCIPS-CM.

Social Security monthly benefits are paid via EFT to a spouse or a divorced spouse, age 60 or over; a spouse or divorced spouse regardless of age with children of the decedent under age 16 or disabled in their care and meeting Social Security requirements.  A  divorced  spouse  must  have  been  married  to  the  service  member  at  least  10  years.    Monthly payments  are  also  paid  to  children  until  age  18,  19  if  a  full-time  student  at  a  primary  or secondary school, or age 18 or older if disabled before age 18.  Spouses who wait until age 65 to apply for Social Security receive maximum benefits.  However, they can receive reduced Social Security payments between ages 60 and 65.  Dependent parents are eligible for benefits at age 62 80 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 if they were more than 50 percent dependent on the deceased service member for  their support. The amount paid can only be determined by the SSA, which has a record of the wages earned by the member during the period of both military and civilian employment under the Social Security Program.    To  apply  for  this  benefit,  the  CAR  should  contact  the  Expedited  Claims  Processing Center  in  Philadelphia,  PA  at  1-866-777-7887,  as  soon  as  they  obtain  sufficient  NOK information  to  establish  the  claim.    This  office  will  explain  the  benefit,  determine  their eligibility,  the  amount  to  be  paid,  and  contact  the  NOK  directly  if  additional  documentation  is required.    The  Expedited  Claims  Processing  Center  will  establish  the  claim  immediately  based on the information provided by the CAR. 4.20.  Social Security Lump Sum Death Payment.  The SSA pays a lump sum death payment, up  to  $255,  to  the  surviving  spouse  living  with  the  member  at  the  time  of  death.    Separation because  of  military  service,  is  considered  living  together.    If  there  is  no  surviving  spouse,  it  is paid  to  the  child(ren)  who  was  eligible  for  or  entitled  to  Social  Security  benefits  during  the month of the member’s death.  No other survivors are entitled to this benefit. This benefit is paid even  if  burial,  funeral,  or  memorial  benefits  were  paid  by  the  Air  Force.    To  apply  for  this benefit, the CAR should contact the Expedited Claims Processing Center in Philadelphia, PA at 1-866-777-7887, as soon as they obtain sufficient NOK information to establish the claim.  This office will explain the benefit, determine their eligibility, the amount to be paid, and contact the NOK directly if additional documentation is required.  The Expedited Claims Processing Center will establish the claim immediately based on the information provided by the CAR. 4.21.

Unpaid Pay and Allowances for Retirees within 120 days.  The retirement pay of an Air Force retired member stops on the first day of the month in which the retiree died.  Upon death of  a  retired  member,  any  pay  and  allowances  due,  but  not  paid  to  the  member,  are  paid  to  the designated beneficiary named by the member prior to retirement.  Normally, this amounts to the retirement  pay  from  the  first  day  of  the  month  of  death  through  the  date  of  death.    Retirement pay electronically deposited into an account held by a retiree will automatically be recouped by DFAS-CL and reissued to the beneficiary for the correct amount. 4.29.1.  When  the  designated  beneficiary  is  deceased,  or  if  the  member  elected  “order  of precedence,” any money due is paid to the first eligible recipient in the following order: 4.29.1.1.  The member’s lawful surviving spouse. 4.29.1.2.  If  there  is  no  spouse,  to  the  child  or  children  of  the  member  in  equal  shares, with the share of any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that child (see paragraph  4.29.2 for payment to minor children). 4.29.1.3.

If none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the member’s estate. 4.29.1.5.  If none of the above, to the person(s) determined to be entitled under the laws of the state in which the member was domiciled. 4.29.2.  To apply for the unpaid pay and allowances, the CAR should complete the required claim  forms  and  provide  copies  of  any  supporting  documentation  as  listed  in  Table  4.3.  to DFAS-CL at 1-800-469-6559.  (T-1). 4.29.3.  When  the  unpaid  pay  and  allowances  are  divided,  the  base  with  primary  assistance responsibility submits all claim forms in one package. 4.30.  Survivor  Benefit  Plan  (SBP).  SBP  is  a  monthly  annuity  paid  by  the  Air  Force.    This program allows personnel who retired on or after 21 September 1972, to receive reduced retired pay in order to provide a monthly annuity to their beneficiaries after the death of the retiree.  The retiree designates the beneficiaries.  Participation in this program is voluntary.  SBP provides an eligible surviving spouse or former spouse or, in some cases, eligible children financial security similar  to  the  financial  security  a  retiree  had  in  retired  pay—a  cost-of-living-adjusted  monthly income for life.  See AFI 36-3006 for additional benefit information. 4.30.1.  If  the  retiree  participated  in  SBP  mail,  email,  or  fax  the  required  claim  forms  and copies of any supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3. to DFAS-CL at 1-800- 982-8459.

DIC  is  payable  by  the  VA  to surviving spouses, unmarried children under age 18, disabled children, children between the ages of  18  and  23  if  attending  a  VA-approved  school,  and  low-income  parents  of  retirees  who  die from  a  disease  or  injury  incurred  or  aggravated  while  on  AD  or  ADT,  an  injury  incurred  or aggravated in  the line of duty  while on  IDT, or  a disability otherwise  compensable under laws administered by the VA.  DIC is not paid if the VA determines that the retiree’s own misconduct contributed to the death.  The monthly DIC rate paid to a surviving spouse of a retiree for deaths occurring after 1 January 1993 is the same for all pay grades.  The DIC amount paid for a spouse with one or more children of the deceased retiree is increased for each child.  The amount of the DIC  payment  for  parents  varies  according  to  the  number  of  parents,  the  amount  of  their individual or combined total annual income, and whether they live together or, if remarried, live with  a spouse.  DIC payments to  a surviving spouse are payable for life,  as long as the spouse does not remarry prior to age 57.  Should the surviving spouse remarry, payments are terminated, but  may  be  restored  if  the  subsequent  marriage  ends  in  death,  divorce  or  annulment.    See Attachment  1,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs,  Federal  Benefits  for  Veterans  and Dependents, and Survivors, for additional information. 4.32.1.

When  the  VARO  makes  a  determination  of  service  connection,  upload  the  signed VA Rating Decision into DCIPS-CM.  (T-1). 4.32.4.1.  The  rating  should  contain  the  signature  of  the  VA  rating  specialist,  and  state approval or denial of eligibility for death gratuity, under Title 38 U.S.C., Chapter 35. 4.32.4.2.  DFAS-CL  will  annotate  their  case  file  accordingly  and  make  payment  if authorized. 4.32.5.  When  assisting  the  spouse  of  a  retiree  who  is  in  receipt  of  VA  disability compensation,  the  spouse  can  receive  the  member’s  final  month’s  VA  disability compensation through the DIC application only.  AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 87 4.33.  Non-Service-Connected  Death  Pension.  If the  Pension  Management  Center determines that the NOK is not eligible for DIC, they may be eligible to apply for a non-service-connected  death  pension.  Surviving  spouses  of  deceased  members  with  wartime  service  and unmarried children under age 18, age 23 if attending a VA-approved school, may be eligible for this pension if they meet income limitations prescribed by law.  Qualifying children who become incapable of self-support because of a disability before age 18 may be eligible for a pension as long as the  condition  exists, unless the child marries or the child’s income exceeds the income limit.    The  rate  of  pension  depends  on  the  amount  of  income  the  surviving  spouse  or  child receives from other sources.  A pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is  reasonable  to  assume  the  estate  will  maintain  them  financially.  The  VA  will  determine  their eligibility.  See  Attachment  1,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs,  Federal  Benefits  for Veterans and Dependents, and Survivors, for additional information. 4.33.1.  To  apply  for  a  non-service-connected  death  pension,  eligible  survivors  should  visit their  local  VA  office  to  complete  the  appropriate  claim  application  and  provide  supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3.  4.34.  Servicemembers’  Group  Life  Insurance  (SGLI).  Retirees  are  covered  for  120  days following  retirement  with  no  additional  premium  during  the  120  day  period.    Retirees  rated totally disabled on the date of retirement  retain  SGLI  coverage until  the disability ceases to  be total  in  degree,  but  not  for  more  than  two  years.    Determination  and  payment  of  proceeds  are made by the OSGLI under the jurisdiction of the VA.  Payment of proceeds to a beneficiary is exempt  from  taxation.    The  insured  member  may  have  designated  as  principal  or  contingent beneficiary any person, firm, corporation or legal entity, including his/her estate, individually or as a trustee.  If the member designated a trust, he/she indicated the name and date of the trust in the  beneficiary  block.    If  the  member  designated  a  trust  through  a  will,  he/she  annotated  “Last Will and Testament” in  the beneficiary block.   If the member chose not  to designate a specific beneficiary but  preferred the proceeds be paid  in  the order of precedence, the member selected the “By Law” designation. See paragraphs  4.18.1. through  4.18.2. 4.34.1.  To apply for the SGLI benefit, the CAR should complete the claim form as listed in Table 4.3.  (T-1). 4.34.2.  Fax the form and a copy of the Initial DD Form 1300 to OSGLI at 1-877-832-4943. 4.34.3.  Upload the form and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in Table 4.3. into DCIPS-CM. 4.34.4.

The  VA  will  pay  a  special  Montgomery  GI  Bill death benefit to a designated survivor if the death is determined to be in the LOD or within one (1)  year after discharge  or release.  The deceased must either have been entitled to educational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill program or a participant in the program.  The amount paid  will  be  equal  to  the  participant’s  actual  military  pay  reduction  less  any  education  benefits paid.  The death benefit is paid to the SGLI beneficiary.  The CAR should submit a letter, along with the member’s SGLV 8286 listing the beneficiary, and a copy of the DD Form 1300 and AF 88 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 Form 348, Line of Duty Determination, as listed in Table 4.3. to the VARO, St. Louis Regional Processing  Officer,  ATTN:    Chapter  30,  Montgomery  GI  Bill,  PO  Box  66830,  331/225,  St. Louis  MO  63103-6830.

Unpaid  Pay  and Allowances  for  Retirees.  The retirement pay of an Air Force member stops on the day the retiree dies.  Upon the death of a retired member, any pay and allowances due but not paid to the retiree are paid to the designated beneficiary named by the retiree prior to retirement.  Normally, this amounts to the retirement pay from the first day of the month of death through  the  date  of  death.    Retirement  pay  electronically  deposited  into  an  account  held  by  a retiree  will  automatically  be  recouped  by  DFAS-CL  and  reissued  to  the  beneficiary  for  the correct amount. 4.47.1.  When  the  designated  beneficiary  is  deceased,  or  if  the  member  elected  “order  of precedence,” any money due is paid to the first eligible recipient in the following order: 4.47.1.1.  The member’s lawful surviving spouse. 4.47.1.2.  When there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member in equal shares, with  the  share  of  any  deceased  child  to  be  distributed  among  the  descendants  of  that child. 4.47.1.3.  If  none  of  the  above,  to  the  parents  of  the  member  in  equal  shares  or  to  the surviving parent. 4.47.1.4.  If none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the member’s estate. 4.47.1.5.  If none of the above, to the person(s) determined to be entitled under the laws of the state in which the member was domiciled. 4.47.2.  To  apply  for  the  unpaid  pay  and  allowances,  the  CAR  should  complete  the  claim form as listed in Table 4.3.  (T-1). 4.47.2.1.  Fax  the  claim  form  and  copies  of  any  supporting  documentation,  as  listed  in Table 4.3., to DFAS-CL at 1 800-469-6559 4.47.2.2.  When unpaid pay and allowances are divided, the base with primary assistance responsibility submits all claim forms in one package. 4.48.  Retired  Serviceman’s Family  Protection Plan (RSFPP).  The RSFPP program allowed personnel  who  retired  before  21  September  1972  to  receive  reduced  retired  pay  in  order  to provide  an  annuity  for  certain  beneficiaries  after  the  death  of  the  retiree.    Participation  in  this program  was  voluntary.    If  the  retiree  elected  to  participate  in  RSFPP,  follow  the  applicable instructions listed in paragraph  4.51. or  4.52.  4.49.  Survivor  Benefit  Plan  (SBP).  SBP  is  a  monthly  annuity  paid  by  the  Air  Force.    This program allows personnel who retired on or after 21 September 1972, or before if they enrolled in  the  program  during  an  open  season,  to  receive  reduced  retired  pay  in  order  to  provide  a monthly  annuity  to  their  beneficiaries  after  the  death  of  the  retiree.    The  retiree  designates  the beneficiaries.    Participation  in  this  program  is  voluntary.    SBP  provides  an  eligible  surviving spouse  or  former  spouse  or,  in  some  cases,  eligible  children,  financial  security  similar  to  the financial security a retiree had in retired pay—a cost-of-living-adjusted monthly income for life.  See AFI 36-3006 for additional information. 4.49.1.  If the retiree elected to participate in SBP, follow the applicable instructions listed in paragraph  4.49. or  4.50.  AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 91 4.50.  Reserve Component Survivor Benefit Plan (RCSBP)  RCSBP is a monthly annuity paid by the Air Force to the surviving spouse or, in some cases, eligible children, of an AFR  member who  dies  and  has  completed  the  satisfactory  years  of  service  to  qualify  the  member  for  retired pay at age 60.  The retiree designates the beneficiaries.  The beneficiary choices are the same as for  SBP.    Participation  in  the  program  is  voluntary.    See  AFI  36-3006  for  additional  benefit information. 4.50.1.  The three options that were available to the member at time of election are: 4.50.1.1.  Option A.  Member declines to make an election until age 60.  If death occurs prior to age 60, no annuity is payable. 4.50.1.2.  Option B.  Coverage provides for an annuity to begin on the 60th anniversary of  member’s  birth,  if  death  occurs  before  age  60,  or  to  begin  immediately  when  death occurs after age 60. 4.50.1.3.  Option  C.    Coverage  provides  for  an  annuity  to  begin  immediately,  whether death occurs before or after age 60. 4.50.2.  If  the  retiree  participated  in  RCSBP,  follow  the  applicable  instructions  listed  in paragraph  4.59. or  4.60.  4.50.3.  Fax the claim forms and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in Table 4.3., to DFAS-CL at 1-800-982-8459. 4.51.  Processing RSFPP, SBP, or  RCSBP Annuities  at Installations With Defense Retiree and Annuitant Pay System (DRAPS) Access. 4.51.1.  Payment should begin within 30-days of the death notification date.  The CAR and FSO must process the annuity in time to meet this goal.  (T-1). 4.51.2.  If the retiree participated in RSFPP, SBP, or RCSBP, the CAR should: (T-1). 4.51.2.1.  Inform the local FSO of a confirmed death. 4.51.2.2.  Give  the  FSO  the  retiree’s  name,  SSN,  date  of  retirement,  grade,  and  date  of death. 4.51.3.  The  FSO  provides  the  CAR  information  on  the  deceased's  retired  pay  and beneficiary’s annuitant pay. 4.51.4.  Within 10 workdays, the CAR obtains from the NOK the required claim forms and supporting  documentation  as  listed  in  Table  4.3.,  and  provides  them  to  the  base  FSO  for processing: (T-1). 4.51.4.1.  When RSFPP, SBP or RCSBP is divided between more than one child and they do  not  reside  together,  the  assisting  CARs  send all  documentation  using  overnight  mail service  to  the  CAR  with  primary  assistance  responsibility,  who  then  submits  all  claim applications in one package to the FSO. 4.51.4.2.  Fax all claim  forms  and supporting documentation directly to  DFAS-CL  at  1-800-982-8459. 4.51.5.  The local FSO: 92 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 4.51.5.1.  Determines  the  need  for  additional  documents,  depending  on  data  already  in DRAPS, and advises the CAR accordingly. 4.51.5.2.  Advises  the  CAR  if  security  restrictions  or  questionable  entitlements  prevent DFAS from processing the annuity package. 4.52.  Processing  RSFPP,  SBP  or  RCSBP  Annuities  at  Installations  Without  DRAPS Access. 4.52.1.  When the casualty assistance base does not have DRAPS access, claim applications for RSFPP, SBP or RCSBP, with supporting documentation, should be submitted directly to DFAS for processing. 4.52.2.  Payment  should  begin  within  30  days  of  the  death  notification  date.  The  CAR  and DFAS should process the annuity in time to meet this goal. 4.52.3.  The CAR must inform DFAS by telephone at 1-800-321-1080 of a confirmed death on the same day the CAR is notified. 4.52.4.  When  informed  of  the  death,  DFAS-CL/FRCAE  immediately  gives  the  CAR information  relative  to  the  retired  pay  account  of  the  deceased,  to  include  RSFPP  or  SBP election, allotments, net pay, VA and retirement pay, and beneficiary data. 4.52.5.  The CAR contacts the NOK to arrange a personal visit to complete the claim forms and obtain the supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3. to establish the account. 4.52.5.1.  The CAR should consider the wishes of the NOK when arranging an assistance visit. 4.52.6.  Within  10 workdays  of being notified of the death,  the CAR faxes the claim  forms along with copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in  Table 4.3., to DFAS-CL at 1-800-982-8459. 4.53.  Dependency  and  Indemnity  Compensation  (DIC).  DIC  is  payable  by  the  VA  to surviving spouses, unmarried children under age 18, disabled children, children between the ages of  18  and  23  if  attending  a  VA-approved  school,  and  low-income  parents  of  retirees  who  die from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated while on active duty or active duty for training, an  injury  incurred  or  aggravated  in  the  line  of  duty  while  on  inactive  duty  for  training,  or  a disability otherwise compensable under laws administered by the VA.  DIC payments may also be authorized for the survivor of a retiree who had a service-connected total disability at the time of death but whose death was not the result of his/her service-connected disability.  The survivor qualifies  if  the  retiree  was  continuously  rated  totally  disabled  for  a  period  of  10  or  more  years immediately  preceding  death,  or  the  retiree  was  prorated  for  a  period  of  not  less  than  5  years from the date of discharge from military service. Payments under this provision are subjected to offset  by  the  amount  received  from  judicial  proceedings  brought  on  account  of  the  retiree’s death.  DIC is not paid if the VA determines that the retiree’s own misconduct contributed to the death.  The monthly DIC rate paid to a surviving spouse of a retiree for deaths occurring after 1 January 1993 is the same for all pay grades.  The DIC amount paid for a spouse with one or more children of the deceased retiree is increased for each child.  The amount of the DIC payment for parents  varies  according  to  the  number  of  parents,  the  amount  of  their  individual  or  combined total  annual  income,  and  whether  they  live  together  or,  if  remarried,  live  with  a  spouse.    DIC payments to a surviving spouse are payable for life, as long as the spouse does not remarry prior AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 93 to age 57.  Should the surviving spouse remarry, payments are terminated, but may be restored if the  subsequent  marriage  ends  in  death,  divorce  or  annulment.    See  Attachment  1,  the  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Benefits for Veterans and Dependents, and Survivors, for additional information. 4.53.1.  To apply for DIC, complete the appropriate claim application as listed in Table 4.3. and  mail  the  original  claim  application  and  copies  of  any  supporting  documentation  to  the appropriate Pension  Management  Center.  View the Pension Management Center website located  at  http://www.va.gov/SURVIVORS/Contact_Us.asp  to  determine  which  Pension Management Center you fall under and to view its corresponding contact information. 4.54.  Non-Service-Connected  Death  Pension.  If the  Pension  Management  Center determines that the NOK is not eligible for DIC, they may be eligible to apply for a non-service-connected  death  pension.  Surviving  spouses  of  deceased  members  with  wartime  service  and unmarried children under age 18, age 23 if attending a VA-approved school, may be eligible for this pension if they meet income limitations prescribed by law.  Qualifying children who become incapable of self-support because of a disability before age 18 may be eligible for a pension as long  as the disability exists, unless the child marries or the child’s income exceeds the income limit.    The  rate  of  pension  depends  on  the  amount  of  income  the  surviving  spouse  or  child receives from other sources.  A pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is  reasonable  to  assume  the  estate  will  maintain  them  financially.  The  VA  will  determine  their eligibility.  See  Attachment  1,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs,  Federal  Benefits  for Veterans and Dependents, and Survivors, for additional information. 4.54.1.  To  apply  for  a  non-service-connected  death  pension,  eligible  survivors  should  visit their  local  VA  office  to  complete  the  appropriate  claim  application  and  provide  supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3.  4.55.  SGLI Disability Extension.  Retirees rated totally disabled on the date of retirement retain SGLI  coverage  until  the  disability  ceased  to  be  total  in  degree,  but  not  for  more  than  two  (2) years.  Determination and payment of proceeds are made by the OSGLI under the jurisdiction of the  VA.    Payment  of  proceeds  to  a  beneficiary  is  exempt  from  taxation.    The  insured  member may  have  designated  as  principal  or  contingent  beneficiary  any  person,  firm,  corporation,  or legal  entity,  including  his/her  estate,  individually  or  as  a  trustee.    If  the  member  designated  a trust,  he/she  indicated  the  name  and  date  of  the  trust  in  the  beneficiary  block.    If  the  member designated a trust through a will, he/she annotated “Last Will and Testament” in the beneficiary block.  If the member chose not to designate a specific beneficiary, but preferred the proceeds be paid in the order of precedence, the member selected the “By Law” designation. See paragraphs  4.18.1. through  4.18.2. 4.55.1.  If  the  retiree  was  covered  under  SGLI,  complete  and  fax  the  claim  form  and  any supporting documentation, as listed in Table 4.3., to OSGLI, at 1-877-832-4943.  (T-1). 4.56.  Veterans’  Group  Life  Insurance  (VGLI).  This  program  allows  retirees,  upon retirement, to convert their SGLI coverage during the first 120 days following retirement, or one (1)  year  following  retirement  for  totally  disabled  retirees.    VGLI  is  a  five  (5)  year  renewable term policy, administered by the OSGLI under the jurisdiction of the VA.  VGLI is issued up to the  maximum  allowed  by  law  for  SGLI,  but  not  for  more  than  the  amount  of  SGLI  the  retiree had in force at the time of retirement. 94 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 4.56.1.  See  the  Servicemembers’  and  Veterans’  Group  Life  Insurance  Handbook,  for additional information. 4.56.2.  If  the  retiree  was  covered  under  VGLI,  complete  and  fax  the  claim  form  and  any supporting documentation, as listed in Table 4.3., to OSGLI, at 1-877-832-4943.  (T-1). 4.57.  Service Disabled Veterans Insurance (SDVI).  SDVI is life insurance limited to veterans who left the Service after 24 April 1951.  A member who had a service-connected disability but was  otherwise  in  good  health  could  apply  to  the  VA  for  up  to  $10,000  in  SDVI  life  insurance coverage at standard rates.  Members rated totally disabled by the VA could apply for a waiver of premiums.  For those members eligible for this waiver, additional coverage of up to $30,000 is available,  but  the  premiums  cannot  be  waived.    See  Attachment  1,  the  U.S.  Department  of Veterans  Affairs,  Federal  Benefits  for  Veterans  and  Dependents,  and  Survivors,  for  additional information. 4.57.1.  If  the  retiree  was  covered  under  SDVI,  complete  and  mail  the  original  claim  form and  copies  of  any  supporting  documentation,  as  listed  in  Table  4.3,  to  the  VARO  and Insurance Center, Box 7208, Philadelphia PA 19101 or Fax to 215-381-3561.  (T-1). 4.58.  National  Service  Life  Insurance  (NSLI).  No  retiree  has  enrolled  in  this  program  since 23 April 1951.  (T-1). 4.58.1.  If  the  retiree  was  covered  under  NSLI,  complete  and  mail  the  original  form  and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in Table 4.3., to the VARO and Insurance Center, Box 7208, Philadelphia PA 19101 or fax to 215 381-3561. 4.59.  Veterans’  Educational  Assistance  Program  (VEAP)  and  Montgomery  GI  Bill Refunds.  The VA will pay  a special death  benefit to  a designated survivor in  the event  of the service-connected death of an individual within 1-year after discharge or release.  The deceased must either have been entitled to educational assistance under these programs or a participant in the programs.   The amount paid  will be equal  to the participant’s actual military pay  reduction less any education benefits paid.  If the retiree contributed to these programs, the NOK may be entitled to the death benefit.  The death benefit is paid to the SGLI beneficiary.  The CAR should submit a letter, along with the SGLI Certificate (SGLV 8286) and a copy of the DD Form 1300 as  listed  in  Table  4.3.,  to  the  appropriate  VARO  listed  below.    See  Attachment  1,  the  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Benefits for Veterans and Dependents, and Survivors, for additional information.

Social  Security  Payments.  Social  Security  monthly  benefits  are  paid  to  a  spouse  or  a divorced spouse, age 60 or over; a spouse or divorced spouse regardless of age with children of the  decedent  under  age  16  or  disabled  in  their  care  and  meeting  Social  Security  requirements.    A  divorced  spouse  must  have  been  married  to  the  service  member  at  least  10  years.    Monthly payments  are  also  paid  to  children  until  age  18,  19  if  a  full-time  student  at  a  primary  or secondary school, or age 18 or older if disabled before age 18.  Spouses who wait until age 65 to apply for Social Security receive maximum benefits.  However, they can receive reduced Social Security payments between ages 60 and 65.  Dependent parents are eligible for benefits at age 62 if they were more than 50 percent dependent on the deceased service member for their support. The amount paid can only be determined by the SSA, which has a record of the wages earned by the member during the period of both military and civilian employment under the Social Security Program.    To  apply  for  this  benefit,  eligible  survivors  should  make  application  through  the nearest  Social  Security  Office.    This  office  will  explain  the  benefit,  determine  their  eligibility, the amount to be paid, and help them complete the required claim forms.  Survivors should apply early, as the law generally permits retroactive payments of only 12 months.  Survivors will need to provide supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3.  4.61.  Social  Security  Lump  Sum  Death  Payment.  See  paragraph    4.20  for  program  details.  Survivors will need to provide supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3.  4.62.  The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).  See paragraph  4.21. for program details. 4.63.  Other Assistance.  The CAR should: 4.63.1.  Escort the NOK to MPS Customer Service for assistance in obtaining new ID cards noting their status as survivors and disposition of the members ID card.  (T-1). 4.63.1.1.  Tell  the  NOK  they  might  need  copies  of  the  civilian  death  certificate  in  the future. 4.63.1.2.  Refer  the  NOK  to  the  funeral  director  or  mortuary  officer  (OCONUS)  for assistance in obtaining copies of the death certificate. 4.64.  Additional Casualty Assistance Contacts.  The CAR: 4.64.1.  Applies  for  DIC  in  every  case.    (T-1).    If  local  VA  or  service  agencies  are  not available, it is your responsibility to ensure the NOK applies when appropriate. 4.64.2.  Monitors  the  case  for  receipt  of  DIC,  unpaid  pay  and  allowances,  RSFPP,  SBP, RCSBP, and SSA entitlements.  (T-1). 4.64.2.1.  Confirms  status  of benefit claims or  applications already processed and offers to help expedite settlement, if applicable. 4.64.2.2.  Returns one-of-a-kind documents (i.e., marriage or birth certificate, or divorce decree)  to  the  NOK  in  person  if  possible  or  by  certified  mail,  with  a  return  receipt requested. 96 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 4.64.2.3.  Annotates each contact with the NOK, and summarize relevant information on the AF Form 58, using Attachment 8. 4.65.  Administrative  Closing  of  Casualty  Assistance  Cases.  The  CAR  follows  these procedures: 4.65.1.  Closing  casualty  assistance  cases  is  only  an  administrative  action  for  control  of records.  It  does  not  preclude  further  assistance  to  the  NOK,  such  as  appealing  denials  of benefits. 4.65.1.1.  All benefits should be paid and cases closed within six months. If not, the case must remain open until all benefits are paid and annotated on the AF Form 58. 4.65.1.2.  If  benefits  applied  for  are  denied  or  delayed  by  a  non-Air  Force  agency, continue to monitor these applications until a final determination has been made. 4.65.1.3.  Email  the  error-free  AF  Form  58  to  ARMS,  within  five  (5)  workdays,  as outlined  in  Attachment  8  to  AFPC/DP2SSM  MILITARY  RECORDS  INCOMING  at email  address:  DPSOMP.incoming@us.af.mil.    Keep  proof  of  email  transmission  to AFPC/DP2SSM on file with the signed AF Form 58 in the case file. 4.65.1.4.  Ensure  all  items  on  the  form  are  properly  completed  and  dates  are  recorded accurately and retain a copy of the entire form in the case file. 4.65.1.5.  If  more  than  one  installation  provided  assistance,  make  sure  other  NOK  or persons designated beneficiaries applied for and received the benefits. 4.66.  Maintenance of  Casualty Assistance Case  Files.  See paragraphs  1.21. for details.  (T-1). 4.67.  Processing RSFPP, SBP, or RCSBP Annuity Payment When a Retiree Is Missing.  An SBP  beneficiary  may  apply  for  an  annuity  if  the  participating  member’s  retired  pay  has  been suspended because the member is missing. 4.67.1.  See paragraphs  4.50. and  4.51. for RSFPP and SBP information. 4.67.2.  DFAS-CL  suspends  a  missing  retiree's  retired  pay,  but  the  CAR  may  begin processing  annuity  claims  if  the  retiree  is  an  RSFPP  or  SBP  participant.    NOTE:  This procedure  is  not  officially  casualty  assistance  because  there  is  no  legal  determination  of death.  4.67.3.  Due  to  the  unique  circumstances  of  these  cases,  the  CAR  should  immediately telephone AFPC/DPFFF at DSN 665-2273 for guidance on each case. 4.67.4.  Because it is not officially casualty assistance, do not start a case file or track annuity payment. 4.67.5.  If requested, the CAR helps the beneficiary collect and submit evidence that: 4.67.5.1.  The retiree has been missing for at least 30-days. 4.67.5.2.  A reasonable person would conclude that the retiree is deceased. 4.67.5.3.  Such evidence must include: 4.67.5.3.1.  A  statement  signed  by  the  applicant  describing  the  circumstances  of  the retiree's disappearance. AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 97 4.67.5.3.2.  Supporting documents such as: 4.67.5.3.2.1.  A police missing person report. 4.67.5.3.2.2.  Signed statements from persons who last saw the retiree alive. 4.67.5.3.2.3.  A  detailed  description  of  the  geographical  location,  local  weather conditions,  mental  and  physical  condition  of  the  retiree,  and  any  other  pertinent data potentially leading to the retirees recovery. 4.67.6.  DFAS/GC determines whether to start RSFPP or SBP annuity payments.  A decision to begin payments does not constitute a legal determination of death. 4.67.7.  The date the Air Force suspended retired pay will be considered the date of death for payment purposes. 4.67.8.  If the retiree participated in RSFPP or SBP, the CAR completes and faxes the claim form with copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in Table 4.3., to DFAS-CL at 1-800-982-8459.  (T-1). 4.67.9.  If the Air Force later declares the retiree deceased, the CAR performs the appropriate casualty reporting and assistance.  (T-1). Section 4E—Benefit Information and Casualty Assistance Procedures for RegAF, ANG, and AFR Members in a Duty Status, and applicable Civilians Declared Missing 4.68.  General Procedures. 4.68.1.  AFPC/DPFCM is the primary point of contact with the NOK regarding information related  to  the  member’s  status;  however,  the  CAR  is  a  local  conduit  to  the  NOK  and  is essential to providing casualty assistance. 4.68.2.  Do not provide any documents or use verbiage in communication with the NOK that convey  death  or  death  benefits  (e.g.,  DoD  Survivor’s  Guide  to  Benefits,  express “condolences,”  etc.)  as  they  may  suggest  to  the  NOK  that  the  member  is  not  missing,  but presumed to be deceased. 4.69.  Financial Assistance. 4.69.1.  The CAR should ask the NOK about their immediate financial needs. 4.69.2.  If applicable, refer the NOK to the A&FRC for financial counseling.  If the CAR is not at an installation with an A&FRC, contact the nearest RegAF A&FRC. 4.70.  Pay and Allowances. 4.70.1.  A member continues to receive all pay and allowances which they were receiving on the effective date of missing status.  Specific guidance is located in the DoD 7000.14-R. 4.70.2.  All allotments in effect at the time of the missing status are continued. 4.70.2.1.  The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) or designee, through DFAS-IN, may initiate,  suspend,  resume,  increase,  decrease,  or  stop  allotments  on  behalf  or  interest  of the missing member, dependents, or the USAF. 98 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 4.70.2.2.  The  SECAF  (or  designee)  may,  in  the  interest  of  the  missing  member  or dependents,  initiate,  increase,  decrease,  or  stop  allotments  to  a  Uniformed  Services Savings Deposit Program (USSDP) as well as authorize withdrawal of deposits. 4.71.  Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) 4.71.1.  If  the  member  was  paying  premiums  at  the  time  they  became  missing,  they  will continue to be covered by SGLI. 4.71.2.  SGLI  coverage  may  not  be  initiated,  increased,  decreased,  or  stopped  while  the member is in a missing status. 4.72.  Social Security Administration 4.72.1.  A  DD  Form  1300  reflecting  the  member’s  missing  status  will  be  provided  to  the SSA.  The purpose is two-fold: 4.72.1.1.  Serves as a statement of intent for possible future claim of benefits. 4.72.1.2.  Places  a  block  on  the  member’s  SSN  to  protect  the  member’s  account  from unauthorized usage.  This does not affect the spouse or dependents in any manner. 4.73.  Other Assistance. 4.73.1.  Advise the NOK, if applicable, that special tax rules may apply that provides for the entire amount of compensation of military and civilian members who are missing in action, prisoners of war, or detained to be tax deferred until they are returned to military control or determined to be deceased.   AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 99 Table 4.1.

Minimum Counseling Information for Members Making SGLI Elections. 8.3.1.  Title  38  U.S.C.,  Section  1967(d),  requires  special  counseling  to  inform  members  of their  insurance  benefits,  the  rationale  behind  those  benefits,  and  the  general  availability  of commercial  alternatives.    It  is  intended  to  stimulate  consideration  of  personal  insurance requirements  in  the  context  of  overall  estate  planning.    General,  not  detailed  or comprehensive,  information  is  required  by  this  provision  of  law.    The  required  counseling should  be  conducted  at  the  time  initial  SGLI  coverage  is  elected,  even  if  the  automatic maximum level of coverage is retained, and upon the occasion of any election to increase or 128 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 decrease the level of SGLI coverage in effect.  As a minimum, the following information is provided: (T-1). 8.3.2.  Purpose and role of life insurance.  Life insurance can serve a number of purposes, but the principal role is to ease the financial burden imposed on survivors when a member dies before  achieving  the  financial  strength  needed  to  cover  the  expenses  associated  with  death and any associated loss of income to those financially dependent on the member.  Generally, persons with a family require more insurance during the period of time their family is young.  Extra money would be needed to meet childcare, education, and personal expenses for their dependent  children.  Thus, as their children  reach adulthood, their future expenses begin  to diminish  while  their  financial  strength  has  increased.    As  a  result,  they  may  need  less insurance, having reached a point of long-term financial stability. 8.3.3.  Term insurance versus whole life insurance.  There are several types of life insurance, but the two principal types are term and whole life.  Term insurance covers a limited period of  time  while  whole  life  covers  an  indefinite  period,  or  the  insured  person’s  whole  life.  While term  insurance may  be renewable past  the established period of coverage, premiums for  the  new  period  will  likely  be  increased  to  cover  the  higher  risk  of  death  as  the  insured person gets older.  Thus, while people are young, premiums for term insurance are generally low,  but  can  be  expected  to  increase  substantially  for  persons  age  60  to  70.    Many  term policies stop  at  age 70 or thereabouts.  Because the life expectancy for Americans is  in  the range of 70 to 80 years of age, many people strive to achieve long-term financial stability by that  age.    They  may  stop  their  term  policies  and  rely  on  their  investments  and  permanent income to meet the limited needs, which remain.  Although SGLI and VGLI are considered to be term-type life insurance policies, they are "renewable for life" unlike many commercial term  policies.  Premiums for whole life insurance depend on the age at  which the policy is purchased, but  generally do not  increase.  However, the premiums  are initially  greater than term insurance premiums at the same age, but then in later years the premiums are less than term  policies  at  that  age.    During  the  early  years  of  a  whole  life  policy,  when  higher premiums  are  being  paid,  the  policy  may  carry  a  cash  value  because  the  premiums  paid exceed the actual  cost  of coverage.  At some point,  the cash value may  grow large  enough that  no  more  premiums  need  to  be  charged  in  order  to  assure  a  given  "face  value"  of  the policy for life.  If the insured takes this option, the policy is paid up for their whole life. 8.3.4.  SGLI  and  VGLI.    Another  important  benefit  of  SGLI  insurance  is  the  ability  to convert to VGLI after leaving the military.  VGLI can be taken up to the  amount of SGLI the member has at the time of separation.  It can be retained for life or converted to permanent commercial insurance with the extra costs underwritten by the SGLI program.  Unless totally disabled, SGLI coverage will terminate at the end of the 120 day period following separation, but  the  SGLI  level  of  coverage  may  be  maintained  through  VGLI.    If  totally  disabled,  a member should complete an SGLV 8715 and submit it to OSGLI to find out if they qualify for an extension of their SGLI coverage for two (2) years from the date of separation or the date  their  disability  ends,  whichever  comes  first.    VGLI  can  be  applied  for  up  to  two  (2) years following the 120 day period, but evidence of good health will be required.  The cost of VGLI  increases  with  each  new  5-year  age  group,  becoming  significantly  more  expensive after age 65.  Thus, VGLI is similar to most other term insurance programs.  AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 129 8.3.5.  Commercial insurance.  Almost anyone on active duty or in the Ready Reserve should be qualified to buy a commercial life insurance policy at reasonable cost.  It all depends on the company and type of policy desired.  Many military associations provide term insurance at  a  group rate.   Because they may  screen applicants  for health and high-risk practices like smoking, flying, parachute jumping, premiums can be fairly competitive, while allowing for some  profit.    Some  associations  offer  the  insurance  more  as  a  benefit  than  as  a  money-making proposition and this helps keep premiums down.  However, the SGLI premiums are the  same  for  everyone,  regardless  of  the  risk  factors  involved  and  there  is  no  clause  for wartime death.  Some private policies may not pay in the event of a war casualty or if there is no war clause, the company may not have the financial resources to pay if war casualties are high. 8.3.6.  Family  Member  Servicemembers'  Group  Life  Insurance  (FSGLI).    Expands  SGLI coverage to insurable spouses and children. 8.3.6.1.  If  a  member  is  covered  under  SGLI,  spouse  and  children  (including  step  and adopted)  coverage  is  automatic.    Spouse  coverage  will  add  an  additional  cost  to  the monthly  premium.    Member  may  elect  to  decline  or  reduce  FSGLI  for  their  spouse  in writing (SGLV 8286A), but children’s coverage is free and cannot be declined unless the member is not covered under SGLI. 8.3.6.2.  The amount of spouse coverage cannot  exceed the amount of coverage held by the  member  or  $100,000,  whichever  is  less.

An insured member may designate as principal beneficiary or contingent  beneficiary any person, firm, corporation, or legal entity (including the member’s estate), individually or as a trustee. 8.8.2.  The following are guidelines to be used in the preparation of the SGLV 8286: 8.8.2.1.  A member should be encouraged to name a specific beneficiary.  Use of the “By Law” designation should be discouraged. 8.8.2.2.  If  a  member  does  not  want  to  designate  a  specific  beneficiary,  but  prefers  the proceeds to be paid in the order of precedence, the member should enter “By Law” by his or her own hand (printed or cursive) in the appropriate space in part 2 of the form. 8.8.2.2.1.  The insurance proceeds will automatically be paid in the following order of precedence: 8.8.2.2.1.1.  Surviving spouse of member. 8.8.2.2.1.2.  Child  or  children  of  the  member,  in  equal  shares,  with  the  share  of any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that child. 8.8.2.2.1.3.  Parents  in  equal  shares,  or  all  to  the  surviving  parent.    NOTE: Biological  parents  are  not  always  who  the  member  intended  to  receive  the proceeds, and in cases of abandonment, they are not always recognized as legal parents.    Claim  disputes  involving  the  recognition  of  “rightful”  parents  can  be avoided  by  discouraging  the  use  of  “By  Law”  designations  and  listing  the parent(s) by name.  8.8.2.2.1.4.  A duly appointed executor or administrator of the member’s estate. 8.8.2.2.1.5.  Other qualified family members. 8.8.3.  When a member is likely to be survived by a spouse, children, or parents and member designates some other person or entity as beneficiary, MPS Customer Service Element:  (T-3). 8.8.3.1.  Counsels the member to the fact that the SGLI law was specifically designed to provide some form of security for spouse, children, or parents. 8.8.3.2.  Encourages beneficiaries. the  member to  designate  spouse,  children,  or  parents  as 134 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 8.8.3.3.  Advises married members that a letter of advisory will be sent to their spouse, if they elected to decline or reduce coverage or designate someone other than their spouse to receive SGLI benefits. 8.8.3.4.  If  the  designation  is  to  be  continued,  a  memorandum  indicating  that  this  was discussed  with  the  member  should  be  sent  to  ARMS  along  with  the  forms  and  a  paper copy should be kept until ARMS is updated. 8.8.3.5.  Under  no  circumstances  should  a  member  be  compelled  to  designate  any beneficiary. 8.8.4.  When  a  member  wishes  to  name  minors  as  beneficiaries  such  as  his  or  her  own children,  nephews,  nieces,  etc.,  the  member  should  be  advised  that  the  proceeds  of  the insurance cannot be paid to a minor beneficiary, other than a minor surviving spouse, without a court-appointed guardian of the children’s financial estates. 8.8.4.1.  The appointment of a guardian is  often time-consuming and costly, which may delay the payment of proceeds. 8.8.4.2.  The amount of the proceeds can be materially reduced by the payment of court costs,  attorney  fees,  and  expenses  incurred  by  the  guardian.    One  way  to  avoid  such complications  and  expense  is  to  designate  a  pre-appointed  trustee  of  the  minor beneficiary. 8.9.  Accelerated Benefit Option (ABO).  Anyone who is insured by SGLI or VGLI and whose life expectancy is 9-months or less may be eligible for the ABO.  Up to  50 percent of the face value  of  an  SGLI  or  VGLI  coverage  may  be  paid  as  an  accelerated  benefit.    The  accelerated benefits are paid in a lump sum only and are exempt from taxation.  If an insured wants less than 50  percent  of  the  face  value,  it  will  be  paid  in  $5,000  increments  only.    Once  an  election becomes  effective  (by  cashing  or  depositing  the  Accelerated  Benefit  payment),  it  cannot  be revoked.  A member is not eligible for additional Accelerated Benefits. 8.9.1.  Service members with FSGLI coverage have access to up to 50% of the face value of the  spousal  coverage  through  the  ABO.    The  ABO  is  available  in  $5,000  increments.    In order  to  qualify,  the  spouse  must  have  a  life  expectancy  of  9-months  or  less.    This  benefit will be paid only to the service member. 8.9.2.  Personnel wanting to claim this benefit should have their provider complete page 3 of the  SGLV  8284/8284A  or  provide  a  letter  from  their  attending  physician  to  the  OSGLI stating the member or spouse has a life expectancy of less than 9-months. 8.9.3.  If  accelerated  benefits  are  paid,  the  remaining  SGLI/VGLI/FSGLI  coverage  will  be reduced  correspondingly with  the amount of accelerated benefits  paid  and the  insured must continue to pay premiums on the remaining coverage. 8.9.3.1.  When  accelerated  benefits  are  paid,  a  new  Form  SGLV  8286/8286A  for  the remaining coverage must be completed.  (T-1). 8.10.  Election for Method of Payment of Insurance Proceeds. 8.10.1.  An insured member may elect the proceeds of SGLI be paid to the beneficiary in a lump-sum payment or in 36 equal monthly installments. AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 135 8.10.1.1.  An  insured  member  may  also  change  the  method  of  settlement  at  any  time without the consent of the beneficiary. 8.10.2.  If  the  insured  member  elects  a  lump-sum  payment  or  makes  no  election,  the beneficiary  may  choose  either  the  lump-sum  settlement  either  through  the  Prudential Alliance Account check, electronic funds, or 36 monthly installments. 8.10.3.

See  Joint  Publication  1-02, DoD  Dictionary  of  Military  and  Associated  Terms,  for  the  official  DoD  definition  of  many  of these  terms.    Throughout  this  AFI,  the  word  “member”  refers  to  military  or  retired  personnel and the word “person” refers to either civilian or military personnel. Active  Air  Force—Members  of  the  Regular  Air  Force,  United  States  Air  Force  Academy Cadets,  and  Air  National  Guard  and  United  States  Air  Force  Reserve  members  serving  on extended  active  duty  (i.e.,  they  are  assigned  to  an  active  duty  unit  and  their  accountability  is against active force strength). Active Component (AC)—That portion of the armed forces as identified in annual authorization acts  as  “active  forces,”  and  in  10  USC  115  as  those  active-duty  personnel  paid  from  funds appropriated for active-duty personnel (DODI 1215.06). Active  Duty  Status—Full-time  duty  in  the  active  Military  Service  of  the  United  States.  It includes  full-time  training  duty,  annual  training  duty,  and  attendance,  while  in  active  Military Service,  at  a  school  designated  as  a  Service  school  by  law  and  the  Secretary  of  the  Military Department  concerned.  It  does  not  include  full-time  National  Guard  duty.  At  any  time,  an 152 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 authority designated by the Secretary concerned may order a member of the RC under his or her jurisdiction  to  AD  or  retain  the  member  on  AD  with  the  consent  of  the  member  under  the authority of Sections 12301(d), 12301(h) and 12322 of reference (g). However, a member of the Army  National  Guard  of  the  United  States  (ARNGUS)  or  Air  National  Guard  of  the  United States (ANGUS) may not be ordered to AD under that authority without the consent of the Governor or other appropriate authority of the State or territory, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia. For the RC, AD is comprised of the categories ADT and ADOT (DODI 1215.06). Active Duty for Operations Support (formerly known as Active Duty for Special Work)—Authorized Reserve component personnel on voluntary Active Duty, funded through applicable military  or  Reserve  personnel  appropriations  (ADOS-AC  funded  or  ADOS-RC  funded)  to support  AC  or  RC  programs,  respectively.  The  purpose  of  ADOS  is  to  provide  the  necessary skilled manpower assets to support existing or emerging requirements (DODI 1215.06). Active Duty for Training (ADT)—A tour of active duty which is used for training members of Reserve components to provide trained units and qualified persons to fill the needs of the Armed Forces  in  times  of  war  or  national  emergency  and  such  other  times  as  the  national  security requires.    The  member  is  under  orders  that  provide  for  return  to  non-active  status  when  the period of active duty for training is completed.  It includes annual training, special tours of active duty  for  training,  school  tours,  and  the  initial  duty  for  training  performed  by  non-prior  service enlistees.  ADT for Air National Guard is always performed in a Title 10, U.S.C. federal status and  may  be  referred  to  as  annual  training,  special  training,  formal  school  training,  and  initial active duty for training.  Active duty for training can be training under Title 10, U.S.C., Section 12301(b).  This duty may satisfy the requirement for an individual to perform 15 days of active service for training per fiscal year. Active  Duty  Other  than  for  Training—A  category  of  active  duty  used  to  provide  Reserve component  support  to  either  active  component  or  reserve  component  missions.    It  includes  the categories of active duty for special work, active Guard/Reserve duty in Title 10, U.S.C. status, and  involuntary  active  duty  in  accordance  with  Title  10,  U.S.C.,  Sections  12301,  12302,  and 12304.    Training  may  occur  in  the  conduct  of  active  duty  other  than  for  training.    Active  duty other  than  for  training  in  support  of  the  active  component  is  usually  supported  by  Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA), man-days. Active Service—Service on active duty or full-time National Guard duty. Annuity—The monthly or annual payment a beneficiary receives. AGATE—A patient is making normal improvement.

Sample 9-Month Investigation Report. Appropriate Letterhead                                                                                                                                        (date) MEMORANDUM FOR  AFPC/DPFCM    FROM: (Organization Mailing Address)   SUBJECT: 9-Month Investigation Report on a Missing Person        This 9-month investigation report pertains to Major Roger C. Smith, 023-45-6789, missing from Eglin AFB FL since 15 May 1997.  I am forwarding it IAW AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services, Chapter 2.        The initial circumstances surrounding the loss of Major Smith in an Eglin AFB Aero club Cessna 172 aircraft incident remain unchanged.  We have maintained close contact with Air Force, state, and federal investigative agencies in an attempt to establish Major Smith's true status.  However, all follow-up actions have been negative.  The only supplemental information you haven't received in subsequent reports is that on 14 December 1997, the Federal Aviation Administration office in Pensacola, FL thought a dredging machine had recovered the tail section of the missing aircraft in a body of water adjacent to Eglin AFB.  Further analysis revealed it was from a Piper Cub rather than a Cessna.        I based my decision to place Major Smith in a missing status on my belief that he probably encountered severe weather soon after his departure on a routine night training flight, and that the aircraft crashed within 20 miles of Eglin AFB.  Given his outstanding physical condition, I felt it was possible for him to survive on one of the small islands in the area, even if injured, until he could be located by search and rescue personnel, recreational boaters, or fishermen.  Considering the passage of time without any information from or about Major Smith or anything whatsoever concerning the missing aircraft, it now appears that Major Smith did not survive the crash of his aircraft, which apparently occurred over water.  Accordingly, I recommend that the Air Force change the status of Major Roger C.

Sample Witness Statement.   164 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 Attachment 5 CASUALTY NOTIFICATION OFFICER CHECKLIST A5.1.  Purpose  of  Notification.  To  provide  dignified,  compassionate  and  humane  notification to  NOK  and  other  designated  persons  as  promptly  as  possible  after  a  member  is  placed  in  a casualty status of deceased, Duty Status-Whereabouts Unknown (DUSTWUN), or Missing. A5.2.  Background. A5.2.1.  This  checklist  provides  guidance notifications. for  preparing  and  completing  casualty A5.2.2.  A casualty notification will probably be one of the hardest duties you will perform in your military career. A5.2.3.  You must convey, in every action and deed, the sincere concern of the Air Force for the feelings of the NOK. A5.2.4.  Your duty as a casualty notification officer is to “soften the blow,” if possible, and to show that the Air Force is genuinely concerned about its members and their families. A5.2.5.  Each  notification  is  unique  as  a  result  of  the  individuals  and  circumstances surrounding the incident.  We cannot cover all situations that you might encounter.  We hope this  checklist  will  provide  enough  information  to  assist  you  in  preparing  and  completing  a casualty  notification  and  ease  some  of  the  anxiety  often  experienced  by  individuals  when called upon to perform this sensitive task. A5.2.6.  Remember,  nothing  can  substitute  for  common  sense,  good  judgment,  and sensitivity in making a casualty notification. A5.3.  Casualty Notification Responsibility. A5.3.1.  Air  Force  Personnel  Center,  Casualty  Services  Branch  (AFPC/DPFCS)  assigns  the Air  Force  activity  (RegAF,  Air  National  Guard,  AFR,  and  Air  Force  Reserve  Officer Training Corps) nearest to the NOK residence to accomplish the casualty notification. A5.3.2.  If  the  NOK  live  on  or  near  the  member’s  home  installation,  the  member’s  wing, group, squadron commander, or other officer, as determined by the installation commander, makes  personal  notification  to  the  NOK,  provides  circumstances  surrounding  the  incident and expresses condolences. A5.3.2.1.  The casualty notification duty: A5.3.2.2.  Is on behalf of the Air Force Chief of Staff. A5.3.2.3.  Has priority over all duties, except in emergencies. A5.3.2.4.  Is  accomplished  in  service  dress  uniform  with  the  exception  of  the  medical technician who can wear whites (he/she remains in the vehicle).    AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 165 A5.4.  Notification Team Composition. A5.4.1.  Field grade officers, of equal or higher grade than the member about whom they are making  notification,  are  assigned  the  responsibility  for  personal  notification  as  directed  by the  installation  commander  or  Chief,  AF  Casualty  Services  Branch  (AFPC/DPFCS).  EXCEPTION: AFPC/DPFCS may assign other officers to notification duty. A5.4.1.1.  Team composition will consist of a minimum of two military members. A5.4.1.1.1.  Medical personnel (e.g., doctor, nurse, or medical technician) and an Air Force  chaplain,  if  available,  accompany  the  notification  officer  to  attend  to  any reaction of the NOK. A5.4.1.1.2.  Notification should not be delayed due to the inability to obtain a medical officer or chaplain.  However, there must be two military members on the team and leadership should choose another team member. A5.4.1.1.3.  Public  Affairs  should  accompany  the  notification  officer  if  media attention is expected. A5.4.2.  The commander or notification officer may invite another person to accompany the notification  team  such  as  a  friend,  coworker  or  clergy/leader  from  the  member’s  faith community, known by the member’s NOK whose presence may be comforting to the NOK, if it does not delay the notification process. A5.4.3.  On RegAF installations, notification team members normally assemble in the CAR’s office within one hour after receiving the telephone call from the CAR. A5.4.3.1.  In  most  instances,  an  error-free  notification  letter  has  already  been  prepared and is ready for the notification officer to deliver to the NOK. A5.4.3.2.  A notification letter is not required when the member’s commander personally notifies the NOK. A5.5.  Transportation. A5.5.1.  The  CAR,  with  help  from  the  LRS  vehicle  dispatcher,  provides  a  military  vehicle, sedan, mini-van or other appropriate vehicle for the notification officer/team. A5.5.1.1.  Geographically  separated  unit  (GSU)  commanders  establish  arrangements  for use of a government vehicle, if available. A5.5.2.  Notification officers must use military vehicles when available; otherwise, use of a privately owned vehicle (POV) is authorized. A5.5.2.1.  When travel must be performed using a POV, the notification officer submits SF  1164,  Claim  for  Reimbursement  for  Expenditures  on  Official  Business,  to  their servicing financial services office for reimbursement of expenses. A5.5.2.2.  Reimbursement of expenses is chargeable to unit O&M funds.    166 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 A5.6.  Communication Support. A5.6.1.  The FSS or GSU Commander, with the help of support agencies, if required, ensures the  notification  officer  or  team  has  the  means  to  immediately  communicate  with  their installation casualty office and AFPC/DPFCS should they encounter obstacles which prevent effecting and confirming notifications in a timely manner. A5.6.2.  The  immediate  availability  to  communicate  with  your  installation  casualty  office and  AFPC/DPFCS  is  necessary  should  you  or  the  team  encounter  obstacles  that  prevent effecting and confirming notifications in a timely manner. A5.7.  Preparing to Perform Casualty Notifications. A5.7.1.  Review the DoD film, Casualty Notification. A5.7.2.  Review AFI 36-3002, Chapter 3, Casualty Notifications. A5.7.3.  Ensure  your  service  dress  uniform  is  in  good  condition.  You  must  wear  it  for  all casualty notifications. A5.7.4.  Talk  to  your  installation  CAR  to  familiarize  yourself  with  the  Air  Force  Casualty Program and any unique local casualty notification procedures. A5.7.5.  Talk to other field grade officers who have performed a casualty notification. Their experiences might help you prepare to perform this sensitive task. A5.7.6.  Understand  that  your  commander  could  call  on  you  to  perform  a  casualty notification at any time: Be prepared. A5.8.  Guidelines During the Pre-notification Phase. A5.8.1.  Once  your  installation  commander  or  AFPC/DPFCS  selects  you  for  casualty notification  duty,  learn  as  much  as  you  can  about  the  casualty,  the  NOK,  and  the circumstances  surrounding  the  incident.  Verify  if  any  information  is  not  releasable  or classified. A5.8.2.  The installation CAR or AFPC/DPFCS will provide you with: A5.8.2.1.  The notification procedures briefing. A5.8.2.2.  The notification letter. A5.8.2.2.1.  If  assigned  to  a  military  installation,  the  CAR  will  give  you  the appropriate notification letter. A5.8.2.2.1.1.  If  assigned  to  a  GSU,  AFPC/DPFCS  will  fax  or  email  the appropriate notification letter for your signature. A5.8.2.2.1.2.  If faxed, you must retype the letter verbatim and error-free (see AFI 36-3002, Chapter 3, paragraph  3.13., and Attachment 6 and Attachment 7, for further information). A5.8.2.2.1.3.  This  notification  letter  provides  condolences  on  behalf  of  the  Air Force and known circumstances surrounding the incident. AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 167 A5.8.2.3.  You  will  need  to  confirm  the  NOK’s  name,  relationship,  phone  number, address,  and  note  any  special  conditions  (e.g.,  age,  ill  health,  or  precarious  location  of NOK) prior to leaving the base. A5.8.2.4.  Instructions if problems occur. A5.8.2.5.  Map of the area, if available. A5.8.2.6.  Transportation. A5.8.2.7.  Cellular telephone. A5.8.2.8.  AFPC/DPFCS toll-free number (1-800-433-0048). A5.8.3.  Familiarize yourself with the location of the NOK, the circumstances of the incident, and the notification letter. A5.8.3.1.  If you are unsure of the NOK's location, ask the CAR, AFPC/DPFCS, or local authorities for help. A5.8.3.2.  If the NOK reside within an area where your safety may be threatened, request a police escort. A5.9.  Inability to Locate the NOK. A5.9.1.  If it appears the NOK is not at home, you should contact neighbors, law enforcement agencies,  or  the  local  postmaster  (not  a  postal  clerk)  for  information  regarding  the  NOK’s whereabouts. A5.9.2.  If you or the team cannot locate the NOK, or the NOK has moved from the area, you should  immediately  contact  AFPC/DPFCS  at  1-800-433-0048  for  further  guidance  and provide the information concerning attempts to contact the NOK. A5.10.  Making the Notification. A5.10.1.  A representative of the Air Force notifies the NOK in person whenever possible. A5.10.2.  The Air Force honors the NOK’s wishes to notify other NOK. EXAMPLE: If the spouse wishes to  notify  adult children or the parents.    EXCEPTION:  If  the casualty is  the result of either hostile action or terrorist activity, initial notification(s) shall also be made in person to parents who are secondary NOK, unless unusual circumstances exist. A5.10.3.  If  the  NOK  calls  to  ask  about  a  member’s  status  before  they  receive  official notification, AFPC/DPFCS, the member’s commander or a designated representative, or the CAR,  tells  the  caller  the  member’s  status  during  the  call.    You  will  be  notified  by AFPC/DPFCS if the NOK is already aware of the death or missing status. A5.10.4.  You  must  be  alert  to  the  needs  of  the  NOK  and  represent  the  Air  Force  in  a professional manner. A5.10.4.1.  Being  prepared,  sincere,  and  alert  to  the  needs  of  the  NOK  at  time  of notification will reduce some of the shock that is normal under these circumstances. A5.10.5.  Stereotyped procedures are not appropriate. A5.10.6.  As a minimum, you should: 168 AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 A5.10.6.1.  Identify  yourself  to  the  NOK  and  any  other  members  of  the  team. EXAMPLE: "I am Major Thompson and this is Major Jones from the 6th Force Support Squadron at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida." A5.10.6.2.  After  identifying  yourself,  make  sure  you  are  speaking  to  the  correct person(s)  by  confirming  the  identity  of  the  NOK.    EXAMPLE:  "Are  you  Mr.  Thomas Brown, the father of Staff Sergeant Carl Thomas Brown?" A5.10.6.3.  If at least one person to be notified is home, you should state that you have an important message to deliver and ask permission to enter the residence. A5.10.6.4.  Verbally  relate to  the  NOK, without  reading  from  the notification letter, the information contained in the letter, if applicable. A5.10.6.4.1.  DECEASED  EXAMPLE  :  “On  behalf  of  the  Chief  of  Staff  of  the United  States  Air  Force,  I  regret  to  inform  you  that  your  son,  Staff  Sergeant  Carl Thomas Brown, died in  Texas today as  a result  of injuries received in  a  motorcycle accident.”  Then paraphrase any additional circumstances described in the notification letter. A5.10.6.4.2.  MISSING EXAMPLE  : “On behalf of the Chief of Staff of the United States  Air  Force,  I  must  inform  you  that  the  status  of  your  son,  Staff  Sergeant  Carl Thomas  Brown,  has  been  changed  from  whereabouts  unknown  to  missing.”  Paraphrase additional information concerning search efforts and further contact with AFPC/DPFCM as described in the notification letter. A5.10.6.5.  Do not hurry the words; speak as naturally as possible. A5.10.6.6.  Do not extend overly sympathetic gestures that may be taken the wrong way. A5.10.6.7.  Do  not  physically  touch  the  NOK  in  any  manner  other  than  to  assist  in  an emergency.    If  necessary,  summon  the  medical  representative  on  the  team  or  local emergency personnel. A5.10.6.8.  Avoid making detailed statements about the incident. A5.10.6.9.  Inform the NOK that the deceased/missing member’s commander will send a letter explaining and confirming the circumstances surrounding the incident. A5.10.6.10.  If you are the member’s commander or a designated representative and have first-hand  knowledge  of  the  circumstances,  you  may  give  the  NOK  additional information. A5.10.6.11.  Inform  the  NOK  eligible  for  casualty  assistance  that  a  casualty  assistance representative will contact them within 24 hours to arrange for a casualty assistance visit at their convenience. A5.10.6.12.  Inform the NOK that: A5.10.6.12.1.  A mortuary affairs representative will contact them regarding mortuary affairs. For CONUS Casualties only (death only). A5.10.6.12.2.

(death only) AFI36-3002  20 JUNE 2017 169 A5.10.6.13.  Give the notification letter to the NOK, if applicable. A5.10.6.14.  If the NOK has questions or needs additional information, have them call 1-800-433-0048  and  AFPC/DPFCS  will  put  the  NOK  in  touch  with  their  (husband’s, wife’s, son’s, daughter’s, father’s, or mother’s) commander. A5.10.6.15.  For  members  in  a  missing  status,  if  the  NOK  have  questions  or  need additional information, have them call AFPC/DPFCM. A5.11.  Information You Must Not Discuss With NOK. A5.11.1.  Questions about survivor benefits, burial, or similar matters. A5.11.2.  Compensation-related questions dealing with insurance, gratuities, unpaid pay and allowances.

Public Commander, 51st Fighter Wing 550 C Street West Tyndall AFB, FL 78523  Mrs. John A. Smith 111 Pine Street San Antonio, Texas 78232   Dear Mrs. Smith       Please accept my heartfelt condolences on the death of your husband, Major John A. Smith.   John was highly respected by the members of the 111th Fighter Wing, both for his exceptional leadership abilities and his skill as a pilot.  I want to explain the circumstances surrounding John's death as we understand them at this time.       John departed Riyadh Air Base at 9:00 a.m. on the morning of March 30 to conduct a visual reconnaissance mission in a heavily defended, hostile area.  After completing a series of reconnaissance runs and accomplishing an in-flight refueling, he returned to the target area to continue his mission.  During the flight, the aircraft encountered enemy gunfire, and the navigator reported that he heard two loud explosions.  Despite the navigator's continued attempts to contact him, no contact was made.  The navigator flew the aircraft to a safe area and elected to eject both himself and John rather than to attempt a landing.  The ejection was successful; however, John had already suffered fatal injuries.  It was determined that he died instantly as a result of enemy ground fire.       His gallantry on this mission was typical of the outstanding devotion he demonstrated throughout the past eight months.  I am proud to have been associated with John, and I join with the rest of the wing in expressing our deepest condolences at his loss.  Be assured that I stand ready to help you in any way I can during this time of sorrow.                                                                                              Sincerely                                                                                               JOHN Q.
