Personal  camera  use  is  prohibited  during  single operator missions. 2.5.2.  Testing  Requirements.    Devices  that  are  not  authorized  for  flight  in  the  above paragraphs  must  be  tested  in  accordance  with  MIL-STD-461F,  “Requirements  for  the Control  of  Electromagnetic  Interference  Characteristics  of  Subsystems  and  Equipment,”  to determine  their  suitability  for  use  in  flight.    Technical  guidance,  advice  on  testing capabilities, and assessment of test results are the responsibility of ASC/ENAD, 2530 Loop Road West, Wright Patterson AFB (WPAFB) OH 45433-7101, DSN 785-8928 or 785-2860. 2.6.  Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Hazards.  MAJCOMs shall provide guidance for SUAS-Os to ensure the wearing of jewelry (or other personal accoutrements) in, or around, the GCS and at the launch and recovery area do not create a FOD hazard. 2.7.  Equipment Required for Flight.  SUAS typically incorporate self-stabilizing subsystems. All  equipment  necessary  for  automatic  flight  is  required  for  operations.  Note:  The  minimum required displays for emergency manual recovery are: airspeed, altitude, heading, and last known position. 2.7.1.  Flight Instrumentation.  Primary flight instrumentation must provide full-time display of  attitude,  altitude,  and  airspeed  information  and  the  capability  to  recognize,  confirm,  and recover from unusual attitudes.  Information should be positioned and arranged in a manner enabling an effective crosscheck. 2.7.1.1.  The  following  flight  instrumentation  (if  equipped)  shall  always  be  displayed (and illuminated during night operations):  (T-2). 2.7.1.1.1.  Climb/Dive Angle (or pitch and vertical velocity). 2.7.1.1.2.  Bank Angle. 2.7.1.1.3.  Barometric Altitude. 2.7.1.1.4.  Indicated or Calibrated Airspeed. 2.7.1.1.5.  Prominent  Horizon  Reference. 2.7.1.1.6.  Heading. 2.7.1.1.7.  Fault indications to include loss of link. 2.7.1.2.  Electronic Flight Displays.  Many modern instrument displays allow the SUAS-O to optimize GCS instrumentation for a particular mission by de-cluttering, removing or relocating  presentations.    In  some  cases,  a  SUAS-O  can  omit  elements  necessary  for AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015   15  basic  attitude  awareness  and  aircraft  control.    Attitude  awareness  and  the  requirements listed in paragraph 2.7.1 shall always be displayed.  (T-2). 2.8.  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)  Considerations  (If    Applicable).  A  GPS  Notice Advisory to  NAVSTAR Users (NANU) is  an advisory message to  inform  users of a change in the  GPS  constellation.    These  messages  are  released  72  hours  in  advance  for  planned maintenance.    These  messages  are  also  used  to  notify  users  of  unscheduled  outages.  General NANUs can be used to disseminate general GPS information.  For beyond line of sight UAs and those  with  the  ability  to  manually  deselect  satellites,  NANUs  shall  be  checked  if  intending  to operate a GPS-reliant unmanned system.  A source is: http://celestrak.com/GPS/NANU/. 2.8.1.  Operators shall attempt to verify satellite availability prior to using GPS as the basis of flight  operations.    Satellites  that  shall  become  unavailable  during  the  flight  should  be manually deselected, if possible.  (T-2). 2.8.2.  A  GPS  predictive  tool  can  be  found  at  http://augur.ecacnav.com/.    This  resource should not  be used to  replace NANUs, but  as a preliminary mission planning tool or in the event Notice Advisory to NAVSTAR Users (NANU) are unavailable in the operational area. 2.8.3.  Units  shall  develop  procedures  to  disseminate  information  about  GPS  reliability  to operators in the field.  (T-2). 2.9.  SUAS  Hand-off  Procedures.  Detailed  procedures  for  hand-off  of  airborne  UAs  between ground control stations shall be included in each SUAS operator’s manual or established in local operating procedures.  (T-2).  These are the minimum items that shall be accomplished prior to launch of the UA:  (T-2). 2.9.1.  Select time and location for hand-off. 2.9.2.  Select a safe recovery area for the UA. 2.9.3.  Identify a method to confirm positive transfer of control between operators, i.e., voice, UA maneuvering, etc. 2.9.4.  Brief all participants on the contingency plan for unsuccessful UA hand-off. 2.9.5.  Identify and confirm specific equipment settings, required at each GCS, for hand-off.   16  AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 3 AIRSPACE & FREQUENCY COORDINATION PROCESS: FLIGHT PLANS AND FAA CERTIFICATES OF WAIVER OR AUTHORIZATION (COA) 3.1.  General.  SUAS  operations  are  conducted  only  in  authorized  airspace.    SUAS  operating characteristics  and  systems  capabilities,  mission  requirements,  and  SUAS  Crew  qualifications drive  specific  airspace  requests.    Without  a  certified  “Sense  and  Avoid”  capability,  separation from  other  aircraft is  accomplished by mitigating measures such as segregated operating areas, altitude  blocks,  or  external  observers.    For  SUAS  operations  in  the  National  Airspace  System (NAS) outside of Warning and Restricted areas refer to  paragraph 3.4.  Operations conducted within  Restricted  or  Warning  Areas  (or  within  a  theater  of  operations  under  combat  airspace control measures) require only coordination between responsible organizations. SUAS-Os shall be appropriately qualified (or directly supervised by an instructor) in order to conduct operations within the class of airspace authorized for operations. 3.2.  Flight  Plans.  There is  no file and fly provision  for SUAS. This paragraph is  reserved for future development. 3.3.  Airspace.  Airspace  managers  may  resolve  an  airspace  conflict  by  the  use  of  time separation,  altitude  separation,  lateral  separation,  relocation  of  one  of  the  airspace  users, elimination of one of the users, or by concurrence of the approving authorities (range, airspace, and  participating  units)  to  accept  the  assessed  risk  of  simultaneous  operations.  SUAS-Os  and mission  planners  shall  use  the  procedures  in  paragraphs  3.4  –  3.6  to  facilitate  the coordination/deconfliction process. SUAS-Os shall comply with the following: (T-2) 3.3.1.  FAA  Documents  (e.g.  FAAN  JO  7110.512.).    Note:  FAA  Advisory  Circular  91-57, Model Aircraft Operating Standards, does not apply to the operations of SUAS intended for military use. 3.3.2.  DOD-FAA Memorandums of Agreement (MOA). 3.3.3.  ICAO regulations. 3.3.4.  Host country rules, regulations, and laws. 3.3.5.  Military  regulations  (e.g.    AFI      13-204,  Functional  Management  of  Airfield Operations). 3.3.6.  DOD FLIP (e.g. General Planning Guide, Area Planning Guides). 3.3.7.  Local flight regulations and procedures (e.g., Base Flying Regulations). 3.3.8.  SUAS operator’s manuals and checklists. 3.3.9.  Frequency  Deconfliction  directives  (contact  MAJCOM/A6  Frequency  Manager  and Base/Range Frequency Manager). 3.3.10.  Description  of  operating  area  or  a  depiction,  showing  agreed  working  area boundaries/limits.  Consider identifying a buffer zone to prevent exceeding cleared limits. 3.4.  CONUS National Airspace System (NAS) Operations. AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015   17  3.4.1.  Units  shall  coordinate  use  of  airspace  within  the  National  Airspace  System  (NAS) IAW this chapter and FAA directives.  (T-1).  SUAS operations may be conducted outside of restricted  airspace  and  warning  areas  only  with  FAA  authorization  in  the  form  of  an  FAA COA  or  notification  IAW  FAA/DOD  guidance/agreements.    Units  shall  contact  HQ AFSOC/A3OU through their appropriate MAJCOM to obtain assistance with a COA or the FAA  notification  for  operations  is  some  Class  D  and  G  airspaces.  (T-1).    (Exception: AFMC/A3O  shall  process  all  COAs  for  AFMC  RDT&E  missions).  (T-1).    For  planning purposes, a unit submitting a COA should anticipate a minimum of 70 business days prior to flight operations.  For Class G notifications, HQ AFSOC/A3OU requires a minimum of three business  days  prior  to  operations.    Units  requesting  FAA  approval  to  operate  SUAS  shall follow the guidance below: (T-1). 3.4.1.1.  AF  units  shall  request  authorization/approval  for  SUAS  operations  outside  of restricted airspace or warning areas through their appropriate MAJCOM POC. 3.4.1.2.  If approved, the MAJCOM shall forward the request to HQ AFSOC/A3OU via email  to  AFSOC.A3OU.WF@us.af.mil.  If  the  request  is  disapproved,  the  MAJCOM shall notify the unit and provide the rationale for disapproval. 3.4.1.3.  Upon receipt of MAJCOM approval, HQ AFSOC/A3OU shall issue a COA on-line account to the unit (without commit authority).  A COA on-line account is required for both COAs and for Class G notifications IAW the current DOD/FAA MOA. 3.4.1.4.  Units  requesting  the  COA  or  a  Class  G notification  shall  input  the  information into  the  FAA  COA  on-line  system  and  notify  HQ  AFSOC/A3OU  via  email  to AFSOC.A3OU.WF@us.af.mil  that  the  COA  application  or  Class  G  notification information is complete. 3.4.1.5.  HQ  AFSOC/A3OU  shall  review  the  COA  application  and/or  Class  G notification for accuracy to include, but not limited to: 3.4.1.5.1.  Airworthiness statement. 3.4.1.5.2.  Medical qualifications (both observers and operators). 3.4.1.5.3.  Training qualifications (both observers and operators). 3.4.1.5.4.  System and operational information. 3.4.1.6.  Once  the  COA  application  and/or  Class  G  notification  is  complete,  HQ AFSOC/A3OU shall commit the COA/Class G notification to  the FAA and shall notify the unit and the MAJCOM with  the COA case number or Class G notification number. HQ AFSOC/A3OU shall continuously track the COA application status and shall update units and MAJCOM as needed. 3.4.1.7.  HQ  AFSOC/A3OU  shall  notify  AF/A3O-BA  of  the  COA  details  (who,  what, where, when, etc.) and/or Class G notifications via email within 1-day of committing the COA or notification to the FAA. 3.4.1.8.  The  FAA  COA  process  normally  takes  60  business  days  for  new  COA applications  and  30  business  days  for  renewals.    HQ  AFSOC/A3OU,  working  through AF/A3O-BA,  shall  coordinate/  recommend  solutions  to  unit  based  on  FAA  feedback,   18  AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015 questions,  or  concerns.    AF/A3O-BA  shall  engage  with  the  FAA  to  resolve  any  COA issues. 3.4.2.  Units  requesting  UAS  operations  in  the  NAS  shall  coordinate  with  the  appropriate frequency manager for authorization to use SUAS communication frequencies (e.g., control and data links, WIFI, LMR, etc.).  (T-1). 3.4.3.  Units shall remain in communication with the specified controlling agency at all times during operations as well as an independent means of backup communications available from the ground control element to the controlling agency.  (T-1). 3.4.4.  If  operations  spill  out  of  the  assigned  airspace  or  a  Loss-of-Link  (LOL)  condition occurs  and  the  UA  does  not  return  to  the  designated  return  home  point,  contact  the controlling  agency  as  soon  as  possible  and  provide  the  following  information  to  the controlling agency: (T-2). 3.4.4.1.  SUAS type/size. 3.4.4.2.  Last known location and time of LOL. 3.4.4.3.  Heading, altitude, airspeed. 3.4.4.4.  Estimated flight time remaining. 3.4.5.  Contact controlling agency if mission is cancelled or terminated early. (T-2). 3.4.6.  Airspace restrictions for the National Airspace System (NAS).  The FAA defines the NAS as a common network of United States airspace; air navigation facilities, equipment and services,  airports  or  landing  areas;  aeronautical  charts,  information  and  services;  rules, regulations and procedures, technical information, and manpower and material. Included are system components shared jointly with the military.  There are two types of airspace within the NAS, controlled and uncontrolled. 3.4.6.1.  Uncontrolled  Airspace.    The  portion  of  airspace  that  air  traffic  control  has neither the authority nor the responsibility for exercising control over air traffic. 3.4.6.2.  Controlled  Airspace.    Airspace  of  defined  dimensions  which  air  traffic  control service  is  provided  to  IFR  flights  and  to  VFR  flights  in  accordance  with  airspace classification.  Controlled airspace is a generic term that covers Class A, Class B, Class C,  Class  D,  and  Class  E  airspace.  Listed  below  is  a  brief  description  and  depiction  of each class of airspace. For more details refer to the DOD Flight Information Publication, General Planning (GP). 3.4.6.2.1.  Class  A.    Generally,  that  airspace  from  18,000  feet  MSL  up  to  and including FL600, including the airspace overlying the waters within 12 nautical miles of the coast of the 48 contiguous States and Alaska.  Unless otherwise authorized, all persons shall operate their aircraft under IFR.  (T-0). 3.4.6.2.2.  Class  B.  Generally,  that  airspace  from  the  surface  to  10,000  feet  MSL surrounding  the  nation's  busiest  airports  in  terms  of  IFR  operations  or  passenger handling. An ATC clearance is required for all aircraft to operate in the area, and all aircraft that are so cleared receive separation services within the airspace. AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015   19  3.4.6.2.3.  Class C.  Generally that airspace from the surface to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower, are serviced by a radar approach control, and have a certain number of IFR operations or passenger  handling.  The  airspace  usually  consists  of  a  surface  area  with  a  5  NM radius, and an outer circle with a 10 NM radius that extends from 1,200 feet to 4,000 feet  above  the  airport  elevation.  Each  person  shall  establish  two-way  radio communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while within the airspace.  (T-0).  VFR aircraft are only separated from IFR aircraft within the airspace. 3.4.6.2.4.  Class D.  Generally, that airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet above the airport  elevation  surrounding  those  airports  that  have  an  operational  control  tower.  Unless  otherwise  authorized,  each  person  shall  establish radio communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while in the airspace.  (T-0).  No separation services are provided to VFR aircraft. SUAS operations in Class D airspace  require  a  COA  or  other  FAA  approval.  (T-0).  Additional  guidance  in  AFI 13-204, paragraph 5.8 states procedures for local SUAS operations shall be published in the Base Airfield Operations Instruction, and any other appropriate lines operating procedures (LOP).  (T-1). two-way 3.4.6.2.5.  Class  E.    Generally,  if  the  airspace  is  not  Class  A,  Class  B,  Class  C,  or Class D, and it is controlled airspace, it is Class E airspace.  Class E airspace extends upward  from  either  the  surface  or  a  designated  altitude  to  the  overlying  or  adjacent controlled airspace. Also in this class are Federal airways, airspace beginning at either 700 or 1,200 feet AGL used to transition to/from the terminal or enroute environment, enroute  domestic,  and  offshore  airspace  areas  designated  below  18,000  feet  MSL. Unless designated at a lower altitude, Class E airspace begins at 14,500 MSL over the United States, including that airspace overlying the waters within 12 nautical miles of the coast of the 48 contiguous States and Alaska.  Class E airspace does not include the airspace 18,000 MSL or above. 3.4.6.2.6.  Class G.  (uncontrolled airspace).  That airspace not designated as Class A, B, C, D, or E. Figure 3.1.  Controlled Airspace.    20  AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015 3.4.6.2.7.  Restricted Area. Restricted areas contain airspace identified by an area on the  surface  of  the  earth  within  which  the  flight  of  aircraft,  while  not  wholly prohibited,  is  subject  to  restrictions.  Activities  within  these  areas  must  be  confined because of their nature or limitations imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities or both. Restricted areas denote the existence of unusual, often invisible, hazards to aircraft such as artillery firing, aerial gunnery, or guided missiles. Penetration  of  restricted  areas  without  authorization  from  the  using  or  controlling agency may be extremely hazardous to the aircraft and its occupants. 3.4.6.2.8.  Warning  Area.    A  warning  area  is  airspace  of  defined  dimensions, extending from three nautical miles outward from the coast of the U.S. that contains activity  that  may  be  hazardous  to  nonparticipating  aircraft.    The  purpose  of  such warning areas is  to  warn nonparticipating pilots  of the potential danger.   A warning area may be located over domestic or international waters or both. 3.5.  Coordination  Procedures  for  OCONUS  Host  Nation  Airspace.  Refer  to  specific  host nation  agreements  and  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  Standards  and Recommended  Practices  (SARPs).    MAJCOMs  are  responsible  for  specifying  airspace  and frequency request procedures. 3.6.  Coordination Procedures for Combat Zone and other Contingency Operations.  Refer to Joint Publication 3-52, Joint Doctrine for Airspace Control in the Combat Zone, and theater air operations directives. AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015   21  Chapter 4 FLIGHT AUTHORIZATION, APPROVAL, AND CLEARANCE AUTHORITY 4.1.

MAJCOMs shall approve each airfield from which SUAS may operate. 4.3.  ATC Clearances and Instructions. 4.3.1.  The  SUAS-O  shall  ensure  compliance  with  ATC  clearances  or  instructions  unless:  (T-1). 4.3.1.1.  An amended clearance is obtained. 4.3.1.2.  An emergency exists. 4.3.1.3.  Deviation  is  required  in  response  to  a  Traffic  Alert  and  Collision  Avoidance System (TCAS) advisory. 4.3.1.4.  Deviation is necessary to ensure safety of flight. 4.3.2.  If the SUAS-O is unsure of the ATC clearance he or she should immediately clarify it with ATC.   22  AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 5 GENERAL FLIGHT RULES 5.1.  Operational Standards. 5.1.1.  Reckless Flying.  The SUAS-O is responsible for ensuring the aircraft is not operated in a careless or reckless manner that could endanger life or property.  SUAS shall not be used to conduct flights for personal use.  (T-1). 5.1.2.  Off-Station  Training.    The  SUAS-O  shall  ensure  the  execution  of  all  off-station training  activities  are  unit  commander-approved,  flown training requirements,  present  a  positive  image  of  the  Air  Force  and  does  not  present  an  image  of waste and/or abuse of government resources.  (T-1). to  achieve  valid 5.1.3.  Unauthorized SUAS Flight Demonstrations.  Unauthorized or impromptu SUAS flight demonstrations,  maneuvers,  or  “fly-bys”  are  prohibited.    AFI  11-209,  Aerial  Event  Policy and Procedures, addresses authorized flight demonstrations. 5.1.4.  SUAS-Os at their Stations.  Operators shall occupy their assigned duty stations during flight  operations,  unless  absence  is  normal  in  the  performance  of  crew  duties,  or  in connection  with  physiological  needs.    (T-1).    SUAS-Os  shall  not  leave  their  duty  station unless  another  qualified  SUAS-O  is  in  the  ground  control  station  and  the  new  SUAS-O acknowledges control of the aircraft.  (T-1). 5.2.  See  and  Avoid.  SUAS-Os  operating  in  VMC,  whether  or  not  under  radar  control,  are responsible  to  see  and  avoid  other  traffic,  terrain,  obstacles  and  also  maintain  VFR  cloud clearance.  For SUAS operations to comply with see and avoid requirements, they shall have the capability  to  see  (or  detect)  traffic  and  clouds  in  sufficient  time  to  perform  an  avoidance maneuver in a timely manner.  (T-1).  This can be done through the use of dedicated surface or airborne observers (chase vehicle) in direct communication with operators.  If not capable of see and avoid, SUAS may only be operated in approved segregated airspace (Restricted or Warning Areas, Restricted Operating Zones, etc.).   In this case, VFR weather minimums may not apply. MAJCOMs shall determine SUAS weather limit requirements based on aircraft equipage, level of autonomy and crew qualification. SUAS-Os shall not allow the aircraft to be flown so close to another that it creates a collision hazard.  (T-1). 5.2.1.  Compliance.    SUAS  operations  that  do  not  comply  with  paragraph  5.2  shall  be conducted  under  specific  arrangements  with  appropriate  aviation  authorities  (FAA,  host nation, or military control).  (T-0).  FAA COAs issued IAW FAA Order (FAAO) Joint Order (J.O.) 7610.4 Chapter 12, Section 9 or arrangements with host-nation aviation authorities do not waive the FARs nor provide relief from ICAO Rules of the Air. FAAO 7610.4, Chapter 12,  Section  9,  outlines  an  equivalent  level  of  safety  comparable  to  see  and  avoid requirements  for  manned  aircraft.  SUAS  operations  in  compliance  with  a  FAA  COA  are acceptable  because  they  incorporate  an  equivalent  level  of  safety  agreed  to  by  the  FAA. SUAS  operations  in  compliance  with  host  nation  aviation  authorization  are  acceptable provided  they  incorporate  an  equivalent  level  of  safety  addressing  as  a  minimum  the measures outlined in FAAO J.O. 7610.4, Chapter 12, Section 9.  SUAS operations in Special Use Airspace (SUA) are acceptable provided equivalent level of safety measures are in place with controlling agencies and other airspace users. AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015   23  5.2.2.  Operations in the NAS.  ATC only provides separation between IFR and VFR aircraft operating within Class  B and C  airspace.    In Class D and E  airspace,  ATC provides traffic advisories on VFR aircraft on a time-permitting basis.  Standard IFR separation is provided to  all aircraft operating under  IFR in  controlled airspace. Outside the NAS the crew should consult ICAO and country specific guidance outlined in the FCG and FLIP. 5.3.  Right-of-Way Rules.  Usually, right-of-way is given to the aircraft least able to maneuver, which  normally  permits  that  aircraft  to  maintain  course  and  speed.    However,  visibility permitting,  each  pilot  shall  take  whatever  action  is  necessary  to  avoid  collision,  regardless  of who  has  the  right-of-way.    (T-0).    When  another  aircraft  has  the  right-of-way,  the  yielding aircraft shall not pass over, under, abeam, or ahead of the other aircraft until well clear.  (T-0). Note:  Due  to  the  size  and  paint  scheme,  a  small  UA  may  not  be  easily  seen  by  other  aircraft.  Therefore, the SUAS operator shall always be prepared to  take evasive  action to  include  flight termination  and potential destruction of the aircraft. (T-1). 5.3.1.  Distress.  Any aircraft (manned or unmanned) in distress has the right-of-way over all other air traffic.  Manned aircraft in distress have the right-of-way over SUAS in distress. 5.3.2.  Converging.  When converging at approximately the same altitude (except head-on or approximately so), the aircraft to the other's right has the right-of-way. Aircraft of different categories have the right-of-way in the following order of priority: 5.3.2.1.  Balloons. 5.3.2.2.  Gliders. 5.3.2.3.  Aircraft towing or refueling other aircraft. 5.3.2.4.  Airships. 5.3.2.5.  Rotary or fixed-wing aircraft. 5.3.3.  Approaching    Head-On.    If  aircraft  are  approaching  each  other  head-on  or approximately so, each shall alter course to the right.  (T-0). 5.3.4.  Overtaking  Aircraft.    An  overtaken  aircraft  has  the  right-of-way.    The  overtaking aircraft shall alter course to the right.  (T-0). 5.3.5.  Landing.    An  aircraft  established  on  final  approach  has  the  right-of-way  over  other aircraft on the ground or in the air, except when two or more aircraft are approaching to land.  In  this  case,  the  aircraft  at  the  lower  altitude  has  the  right-of-way  if  it  does  not  use  this advantage to cut in front of or overtake the other. 5.4.  Communication in Flight. 5.4.1.  Communication  with  ATC.    SUAS-Os  shall  establish  and  maintain  two-way  radio communications with the proper ATC facility or FSS IAW the procedures appropriate for the class of airspace as outlined in FLIP.  (T-0).  Coordinate alternate communications methods with  the  appropriate  ATC  facility  prior  to  commencing  operations.    (T-1).    For  SUAS operations  in  controlled  airspace,  two-way  radio  shall  be  the  primary  means  of communications.  (T-0).  Maintain contact with the range or special use airspace controlling agency.  (T-2).  Notify the controlling agency if the mission is cancelled or terminated early.  (T-2).   24  AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015 5.4.2.  Emergency Frequencies.  Monitor emergency frequencies at all times (unless the radio equipment does not have this capability).  (T-1). 5.4.3.  ATC  Communications  Failure.    Follow  the  communications  failure  procedures published  in  the  Flight  Information  Handbook  (FIH).    (T-0).    For  SUAS  operations  there shall be an independent means of backup communications available from the ground control element to the ATC agency controlling the aircraft.  (T-1). 5.5.  Airport Operations. 5.5.1.  Takeoff and Landing. 5.5.1.1.  Clearances.  Obtain a clearance from ATC before taxiing, taxiing onto a runway, takeoff  (or  launch),  or  landing  (or  recovery),  at  an  airport  with  an  operating  control tower.  (T-1). 5.5.1.2.  Uncontrolled Field Procedures.  At uncontrolled fields: 5.5.1.2.1.  Use the runway favored by the winds if no other factors make that runway unacceptable.  (T-1). 5.5.1.2.2.  Announce  your  activities  on  the  appropriate  frequency.    (Refer  to  the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) and AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures, for more detail.)  (T-1). 5.5.2.  Turns after Takeoff, Low Approaches, or Closed Patterns. 5.5.2.1.  Do  not  turn  after  a  takeoff,  touch  and  go  or  low  approach  until  at  least  400  ft. above the departure end of the runway (DER) elevation, at a safe airspeed, and past the end of the runway (if visible) unless: (T-1) 5.5.2.1.1.  Specifically cleared by the controlling agency. 5.5.2.1.2.  Safety dictates otherwise. 5.5.2.1.3.  Required by local or published departure procedures.    Note:  The 400 ft. restriction does not apply when executing a closed pattern. 5.5.3.  Traffic Pattern Procedures. 5.5.3.1.  At  Air  Force  installations,  fly  the  traffic  pattern  published  in  the  local  flying procedures publication or FLIP, unless otherwise directed.  (T-1). 5.5.3.2.  At  other  than  Air  Force  installations,  fly  traffic  patterns  as  directed  by  the control tower or published in FLIP, FAR Part 91 Subpart B, or the AIM.  (T-0). 5.5.3.3.  At  airports  with  no  control  tower,  follow  the  standard  light  signals  or  visual indicators  that  prescribe  the  direction  of  traffic  and  landing  runway.    Departures  shall comply  with  the  appropriate  route  for  the  airport.    (T-0).    (Refer  to  AIM    for    detailed information.) 5.5.4.  SUAS  Launch/Landing  Areas.    SUAS  may  operate  from/to  other  than  established landing areas (i.e., fields, highways, parks, etc.) if a military requirement exists and the user receives  appropriate  clearances  (Range  Operations,  FAA  COA,  etc.).    To  use  the  area  for landing, implement safeguards to permit operations without hazard to persons or property. AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015   25  5.5.5.  Night  Runway  Operations.    The  SUAS-O  shall  adhere  to  the  following  guidance during night operations from prepared surfaces (T-1): 5.5.5.1.  SUAS shall not be operated from a runway or other prepared surface unless the takeoff and landing area is outlined with operating lights and is clearly discernible.  (T-1).  Covert runway markings may be used by qualified crews using suitable sensors or night vision devices. 5.5.6.  Landing  Gear  Reporting  Procedures.    SUAS-Os  operating  retractable  gear  aircraft must report "gear down" to the ATC agency or runway supervisory unit after extending the landing  gear.    (T-0).    This  report  shall  be  made  during  any  approach  to  an  airport  prior  to crossing the runway threshold.  (T-0). 5.6.  Altitude  Requirements.  Consider  GCS  Line  of  Sight  (LOS)  to  the  UA  when  selecting minimum operating altitudes.  If an approved FAA COA is required for operation, comply with the provisions of the COA.  (T-0).  If a COA is not required, except for takeoff or landing, do not operate UAs: 5.6.1.  Emergency  Landing.  Below  an  altitude  that,  should  an  emergency  landing  become necessary, creates undue hazard to persons or property.  (T-1). 5.6.2.  VFR.    Under  VFR  above  3,000  ft.  AGL  at  altitudes  or  flight  levels  other  than  those specified  in  FLIP.    In  airspace  under  FAA  jurisdiction,  these  altitudes  do  not  apply  when turning or holding in a holding pattern of 2 minutes or less.  (T-1). 5.6.3.  Congested Areas.  Over congested areas (i.e., cities, towns, settlements) or groups of people  if  the  altitude  does  not  ensure  at  least  1,000  ft.  above  the  highest  obstacle  within  a 2,000-ft.  radius  of  the  aircraft.    Exception:  SUAS-O  operating  Group  1  SUAS  in  the  US NAS or operating IAW host nation agreements may operate at lower altitudes and in closer proximity if they do not create a hazard to persons or property on the surface.  (T-1). 5.6.4.  Non-congested  Areas.    Over  non-congested  areas  at  an  altitude  of  less  than  500  feet AGL  except  over  open  water,  or  in  special  use  airspace,  or  in  sparsely  populated  areas.  Under  such  exceptions,  SUAS-O  shall  not  operate  aircraft  closer  than  500  ft.  to  any  non- participating  person,  vessel,  vehicle,  or  structure.    Exception:  SUAS-O  operating  Group  1 SUAS may operate at lower altitudes and in closer proximity if they do not create a hazard to persons or property on the surface.  (T-1). 5.6.5.  Flight over National Recreation Areas and Wildlife Refuges.  Mission permitting, not less than 2,000 ft. AGL over the following areas: national parks, monuments, seashores, lake shores,  recreation  areas,  and  scenic  river  ways  administered  by  the  National  Park  Service; national wildlife refuges, big game refuges, game ranges, and wildlife refuges administered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service; and wilderness and primitive areas administered by the US  Forest  Service.    This  paragraph  is  not  applicable  to  special  use  airspace,  low-altitude tactical  navigation  areas,  and  MTRs.  Higher  altitudes  may  exist  for  specific  areas.    (See AP/1B  and  sectional  aeronautical  charts.)    Exception:  SUAS-O  operating  Group  1  SUAS may  operate  at  lower  altitudes  and  in  closer  proximity  if  they  do  not  create  a  hazard  to persons  or  property  on  the  surface  and  when  prior  coordination  and  approval  has  been accomplished.  Note: Operations over these areas shall typically require a COA.  (T-1).   26  AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015 5.7.  Disaster  Areas.  SUAS-O shall not operate their aircraft within a designated disaster area.  (T-1).  NOTAMs list disaster areas.  Exceptions are permitted when an aircraft is: 5.7.1.  Tasked to aid in airborne relief for the area. 5.7.2.  Approved to operate from an airport or operating zone in the area. 5.7.3.  On a flight that has been specifically cleared by ATC. 5.8.  Altimeter  Settings.  If  equipped,  set  altimeters  according  to  FLIP  General  Planning  and Area Planning documents.  In combat zones, comply with guidance in airspace control plan and ATO SPINS.  (T-2). 5.9.  Simulated Emergency Flight Procedures. 5.9.1.  Restrictions.  See AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 3. 5.9.2.  Required  MAJCOM  Guidance.    MAJCOMs  shall  publish  guidance  for  practicing simulated emergency takeoffs, approaches, and landings. 5.10.  Touch-and-Go Landings. 5.10.1.  Touch-and-go landings are authorized if required by course syllabus or continuation training requirements. 5.10.2.  MAJCOMs may authorize touch-and-go landings in any command-operated SUAS. 5.10.3.  MAJCOMs  shall  provide  explicit  guidance  in  its  command  supplement  about operating conditions and operator qualifications. 5.11.  Dropping Objects. 5.11.1.  Restrictions.  The SUAS-O shall not allow the dropping of objects from the aircraft except (T-2): 5.11.1.1.  In an emergency. 5.11.1.2.  When mission requirements dictate as specified in the MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 3. 5.11.2.  MAJCOM  Responsibilities.    MAJCOMs  shall  establish  procedures  to  ensure airdrops comply with applicable directives. 5.12.  Aircraft Lighting (if equipped). 5.12.1.  Reduced  Lighting.    MAJCOMs  may  authorize  reduced  or  light-out  operations  in restricted areas,  warning areas or host nation  approved  areas in  a MAJCOM supplement to this  instruction.  Host  nation  approved  areas  may  be  documented  in  a  LOA  or  host  nation regulatory documentation. 5.12.2.  Position  Lights.    Aircraft  equipped  with  position  lights  shall  display  them  between the hours of official sunset and sunrise (T-2): 5.12.2.1.  Immediately  before engine start and when an engine is  running.  Aircraft that do not have power available before start shall turn them on as soon as power is available. 5.12.2.2.  When parked in an area likely to create a hazard or while being towed, unless clearly illuminated by an outside source. AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015   27  5.12.3.  Anti-collision  and  Strobe  Lights.    Anti-collision  lights  and  strobe  lights  are  not  the same.  For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  anti-collision  lights  are  the  primary  flashing  light system  on  the  aircraft  intended  to  attract  the  attention  of  others  to  enhance  see  and  avoid operations,  while  strobe  lights  are  systems  such  as  wingtip  strobes  or  other  similar  strobe light installations. 5.12.3.1.  Ground  Operations.    Aircraft  equipped  with  anti-collision  lights  shall  display these lights IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground.  (T-2). 5.12.3.2.  Airborne  Operations.    Aircraft  equipped  with  anti-collision  and  strobe  lights shall operate these lights as follows (T-2): 5.12.3.2.1.  Anti-collision lights must be on from takeoff to landing. 5.12.3.2.2.  Strobe lights shall be operated IAW MAJCOM or aircraft T.O. guidance. 5.12.3.3.  The SUAS-O may turn off anti-collision lights when it is in the best interest of safety to do so. 5.12.3.4.  The SUAS-O may continue the mission with the failure of any light of the anti- collision light system to the first stop where repairs can be made. 5.12.4.  Landing Lights. 5.12.4.1.  When    mission  requirements  dictate,  use  of  landing  lights  (if    equipped)  is optional  during  take-off/  landing,  if  the  aircraft  is  equipped  with  an  operational  sensor that provides a visual representation of the runway environment. Operations shall comply with paragraph 5.6.5.1.  (T-2). 5.13.  Participating  in  Aerial  Events.  SUAS-Os  shall  ensure  compliance  with  AFI  11-209, when participating in aerial events, demonstrations, and static displays.  Group/CC shall approve any flight operations.  (T-3). 5.14.  Adverse Weather. 5.14.1.  Weather  Conditions.    Maintain  situational  awareness  of  weather  conditions  and trends. (T-2).  Avoid turbulence that exceeds operating handbook limitations and be prepared to change altitudes or course to mitigate turbulence and escape headwinds that may prevent recovery.  (T2).  Avoid flight into precipitation that exceeds operating limitations.  (T-2).  Be aware  of  icing  levels  and  follow  operating  handbook  procedures  for  escaping  or  mitigating icing.    Be  vigilant  of  inflight  visibility,  not  only  because  of  limitations  to  mission accomplishment  and  successful  recovery  but  also  because  of  the  difficulty  imposed  on  any required  observers  or  manned  aircraft  in  seeing  and  maintaining  visual  contact  with  the aircraft.    SUAS-Os  shall  immediately  report  hazardous  weather  conditions  to  their controlling agency.  (T-2). 5.14.2.  Operations  in  the  Vicinity  of  Thunderstorms.    The  SUAS-O  shall  not  intentionally operate  into  a  thunderstorm.    (T-2).    When  observed  or  reported  thunderstorm  activity adversely  affects  the  planned  flight  route,  SUAS-Os  shall  delay  the  scheduled  mission  or alter the route of flight  within approved airspace to  avoid  the thunderstorm  activity.  (T-2).  SUAS-Os shall use all available information including surface radar, PMSV, and PIREPs to avoid  thunderstorm  activity.    (T-2).    Note:  Induced  lightning  strikes  and  electrostatic discharges can occur in what may look like benign conditions; a thunderstorm does not have   28  AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015 to  be  present  for  these  discharges.  See  AFH  11-203,  Volume  1,  Weather  for  Aircrews,  for detailed  information  on  thunderstorms,  lightning,  and  electrostatic  discharge.    SUAS operators shall not takeoff, land, or fly an approach where thunderstorms are producing hail, strong winds, gust fronts, heavy rain, lightning, wind shear, microbursts, or other hazardous conditions.  (T-2). 5.14.3.  Takeoff with Ice or Frost.  The SUAS-O shall not takeoff (or launch) with ice, snow, or  frost  adhering  to  the  wings,  control  surfaces,  propellers,  engine  inlets,  or  other  critical surfaces of the aircraft.  (T-1). 5.15.  Wake Turbulence and Wind Shear.  SUAS-Os operating UAS Group 2 or 3  shall: (T2). 5.15.1.  Report Wake Turbulence.  Notify ATC when encountering wake turbulence on any approach or landing  (T-2). 5.15.2.  Report  Wind  Shear.    Immediately  report  a  wind  shear  or  microburst  encounter  on takeoff,  approach,  or  landing  to  the  most  appropriate  agency  (e.g.,  control  tower,  approach control, PMSV) and, if possible, include (T-2): 5.15.2.1.  Altitude of the encounter. 5.15.2.2.  Loss or gain in airspeed or altitude. 5.15.2.3.  Type of aircraft. 5.15.2.4.  Location of occurrence (see AFH 11-203, Volume 1). 5.16.  Night  Vision  Goggles  (NVG)  Operations.  MAJCOMs  shall  address  the  use  of  NVGs during SUAS operations in the MAJCOM supplement to this instruction. 5.17.  Imagery  and  Sensor  Operations.  When  observing  targets  outside  of  government- controlled  property,  comply  with  AFI  14-104,  paragraph  9.6  “Air  Force  units  with  weapon system  video  and  tactical  ISR  capabilities  may  collect  imagery  during  formal  and  continuation training missions as long as the collected imagery is not for the purpose of obtaining information about  specific  US  persons  or  private  property.”    SUAS-Os  shall  ensure  imagery  and  ISR collection  assets  are  utilized  for  valid  mission  requirements.    (T-1).    Regardless  of  Operations Area,  SUAS  ISR  shall  present  a  positive  image/lawful  purpose  for  the  USAF  and  the  USA.  (T1).    SUAS-Os  and  SOs  shall  not  transfer  mission  collected  ISR  to  personal  devices  or distribute to non-authorized sources.  (T-1). AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015   29  Chapter 6 FLIGHT RULES 6.1.  Visual Flight Rules (VFR). 6.1.1.  Operational Air Force SUAS shall fly under VFR.  (T-2). Fielded SUAS and SUAS-Os  have  neither  the  equipment  nor  training  and  certifications  required  to  comply  with procedures for operation under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).    Until a certified sense-and-avoid  capability  is  fielded,  SUAS  require  dedicated  observers  in  order  to  assure  separation from other aircraft and clearance from clouds.  Normally, SUAS flights are conducted using procedural airspace control in some form of segregated airspace.  When operating outside of Restricted Airspace and Warning Areas, one or more dedicated observers must be employed and the SUAS-O/Observer team must comply with provisions in the operable COA.  (T-1).  The UA must remain in the approved airspace and VFR provisions apply.  (T-1). 6.1.2.  If the weather prevents continued flight under VFR on the planned route, the SUAS-O shall  alter  the  route  of  flight,  as  necessary,  so  as  to  continue  operations  under  VFR  within approved airspace: (T-2) 6.1.2.1.  To the destination.  (T-2). 6.1.2.2.  To land at a suitable location.  (T-2). 6.2.  Flight Operations under VFR. 6.2.1.  National Airspace (NAS).  SUAS-Os operating under VFR in the NAS shall adhere to the weather minimums listed in Table 6.1.  (T-0). 6.2.2.  Restricted  Airspace.    SUAS-Os  operating  under  VFR  in  other  than  FAA  airspace shall: (T-1). 6.2.2.1.  Adhere  to  the  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  VFR  weather minimums listed in Table 6.2.; or (T-1). 6.2.2.2.  Comply with restrictions published in FLIP or FCG.  (T-1). 6.3.  Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).  (T-1). 6.3.1.  Only  AFMC  flight  test  shall  operate  SUAS  under  IFR  and  under  the  following conditions: 6.3.1.1.

Specific considerations include the fatiguing effects  of weather, temperature  extremes,  nighttime  operations  and  use  of  night  vision  imaging  systems,  poor sleeping  conditions  (due  to  both  location  and  time  of  day),  mission  delays,  and  restrictive personal equipment. 7.2.2.  Unit  commanders  may  recommend  restricting  duty  time  or  extending  rest  periods  to the MAJCOM approval authority.  SUAS-Os shall terminate a mission/mission leg if safety may be compromised by fatigue factors, regardless of authorized duty period.  (T-2). 7.3.  Duty Day.  SUAS-O duty day begins when the SUAS-O reports for duty and ends when all SUAS associated post-flight duties are accomplished (AV/GCS teardown, RTB).  The maximum duty  period  (DP)  for  single-operator  controlled  SUAS  is  12  hours  and  14  hours  for  dual controlled (e.g. SrA Smith shows for work and performs 8 hours of primary non-SUAS-O duties.  He can then perform 4 hours of single-operator SUAS-O duties.)  Maximum continuous control time is specified in AFI 11-5MDS, Volume 3. 7.4.  Rest Period.  Rest is required prior to assuming SUAS-O duties.  (T-2).  Interruption of the rest period for any official duty reinitiates the rest cycle. 7.4.1.  Rest is required prior to SUAS flight duties.  The purpose is to ensure SUAS-Os are adequately rested before performing flight or flight-related duties.  The rest period is a non- duty period of 12 hours.  Rest is free time which includes time for meals, transportation, and sleep. 7.4.2.  Interruption of rest.  If the rest period is violated, it is the SUAS-O’s responsibility to inform  his  supervisor  and  shall  not  perform  SUAS-O  duties  until  the  rest  requirement  is satisfied.  (T-2).  Interruption of rest includes conducting official business over the telephone. 7.5.  Scheduling Limitations.  SUAS operators shall not consume alcoholic beverages within 12 hours of flight operations. Do not schedule SUAS-Os for flight duties when (T-2): 7.5.1.  The conditions of paragraph 7.4 cannot be met. 7.5.2.  The  SUAS-O  has  any  medical,  mental  health,  or  medication  issue  which  would negatively  impact  the  SUAS-O’s  ability  safely  operate  the  SUAS  or  which  is  likely  to interfere with the SUAS-O’s ability to maintain focus on flight responsibilities. 7.6.  Alertness  Management  Strategies.  Commanders,  schedulers,  aerospace  medicine personnel,  and  SUAS-Os  all  share  responsibility  for  dealing  with  the  complex  issue  of cumulative fatigue.   32  AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015 7.6.1.  SUAS-Os  shall  receive  adequate  rest to  maintain  optimum  mental/physical functioning.  (T-2).  The principle factors in determining required rest are: the duration and intensity of work done, quality and duration of sleep in the previous several days, the time of day  relative  to  the  body’s  internal  circadian  clock,  and  the  degree  of  circadian  disruption (e.g., shift work or jet lag). 7.6.2.  When  an  individual  sleeps  less  than  his/her  physiologically  required  duration,  or experiences poor quality sleep over successive days, fatigue develops.  As little as two hours sleep  loss  can  result  in  significant  reductions  in  an  individual’s  performance.    Likewise delaying sleep too long results in excessive fatigue and degrades performance. 7.6.3.  The  failure  to  acquire  sufficient  sleep  over  two  or  more  days  results  in  cumulative sleep  debt.  Effects  of  cumulative  sleep  debt  include  physical  and  mental  performance  loss until  the  individual  has  achieved  adequate  sleep.    For  most  individuals,  two  consecutive night’s sleep is needed to fully recover from a significant sleep debt. During periods of high operations tempo, mission planners should give particular consideration to providing SUAS crews regular opportunities to recover from cumulative fatigue. 7.6.4.  Skills  critical  to  flying  tend  to  be  among  the  most  susceptible  to  mental  fatigue including  monitoring  tasks,  embedded  tasks  (e.g.,  instructing  while  flying),  and  higher cognitive processes (such as problem solving in emergencies).  Performance is most impaired during the period of the circadian trough, normally 0200 to 0600 hours.  Therefore, the use of alertness management strategies must be considered for nighttime missions. 7.6.5.  The instructions in  this chapter cannot  provide a solution  to  all the challenges posed by  the  24-hour  demands  of  Air  Force  SUAS  operations.    It  is  essential,  therefore,  that commanders  use  other  reasonable  means  to  sustain  SUAS-O  alertness  and  performance.  Consultation  with  aerospace  medicine  or  other  fatigue  management  experts  is  advisable.  Examples  of  alertness  management  strategies  that  are  currently  available  include  tactics  to promote effective rest and minimize pre-mission duration of wakefulness, such as extended rest  periods,  pre-positioning  and  sleep  quarantine facilities;  non-pharmacological countermeasures, such as bright light/physical activity breaks; pharmacological agents (no-go pills);  and  alertness  management  education  and  training.  “Go”  pills  or  stimulates  are  not authorized for SUAS operations. AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015   33  Chapter 8 NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 8.1.  Read Files.  Review SUASMAN and Unit Read Files before all SUAS missions.  (T-3). 8.2.  Checklists.  Accomplish  all  checklists  with  strict  discipline.    A  checklist  is  not  complete until  all  items  are  accomplished.    The  SUAS-O  operating  the  UA  shall  initiate/complete  all checklists. (T-2).  Operator checklists shall be used for all operations from preflight through post flight.  (T-2). 8.2.1.  Carry abbreviated checklists in checklist binders.  The only pages/inserts authorized in checklist  binders  are:  T.O./Operator’s  Manual  checklists,  MAJCOM-approved  checklists, briefing  guides,  and  approved  information  guides.    Units  may  construct  locally  developed SUAS flight guides. 8.2.1.1.  Make  personal  notes  on  checklists,  briefing,  or  information  guides  in  pencil,  if desired.  If added, all notes shall be current and not in conflict with AFI and MAJCOM supplements.  (T2). 8.2.1.2.  Abbreviated checklist items that do not apply to unit SUAS may be lined out in pen. 8.3.  Video/Data  Capture.  Each  flight  shall  be  recorded  using  the  system’s  data  recorder  in order to  capture both  telemetry  and video data.  (T-1). This  data is  used for training as well as review in the case of an incident or lost UA.  Recordings may be discarded if there is no incident or mishap.  Data recordings from  any reportable  SUAS incident  shall be secured to  support an investigation  to  determine  cause.    (T-1).    Dispose  of  recordings  as  directed  by  MAJCOM Directorate  of  Safety.    Data  from  incidents  involving  manned  aircraft  or  violation  of  ATC procedures shall be provided to the MAJCOM Safety office and HQ AFSOC/A3V.  (T-1). 8.4.  Observers.  Within non-segregated (shared use) airspace outside of Restricted or Warning Areas,  observers  shall  be  used.    (T-0).    Dedicated  observers  assist  the  SUAS-O  in  duties associated  with  safe  aircraft  separation,  terrain/obstacle  clearance  avoidance,  and  cloud clearance.  Observers  shall  be  given  sufficient  training  and  situational  rehearsal  on  VFR  and right-of-way  procedures  to  communicate  clearly  to  the  SUAS-O  any  instructions  necessary  to keep  the  UA  clear  of  other  air  traffic,  terrain/obstacles,  and  clouds.    (T-0).    Observer  training shall  be  specified  in  the  unit  SUAS  training  program  and  must  be  approved  by  the  unit commander.  (T-3). 8.4.1.  Observers shall meet medical standards prescribed in AFI 48-123 or provide a copy of a current FAA Second Class medical certificate.  (T-1). 8.4.2.  Observers  shall  possess  and  operationally  check  real-time  communications  link(s)  to the SUAS-O prior to the UA entering or commencing flight operations within the observed airspace.  (T-1).  Maintain continual real-time communications with the controlling SUAS-O. 8.4.3.  If the SUAS-O is unable to maintain real-time communications with the observer, the UA shall be returned home, landed, or returned to an area that provides the SUAS-O visual line-of-sight to the UA. (T-1).   34  AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015 8.4.4.  Within  Restricted  or  Warning  Areas,  Operational  Risk  Management  mitigation  may require observers to be employed. 8.4.5.  Observer  Duties.    Observer(s)  duties  are  to  continuously  observe  assigned  airspace sector(s) for any aircraft, balloon, or parachutist and make timely standardized traffic reports.  If  traffic  becomes  a  factor  to  the  UA,  the  observer  assesses  closure  rate  and  projected proximity  and  makes  a  descriptive  call  to  the  SUAS-O  controlling  the  UA.    If  traffic continues  to  pose  a  collision  hazard  and  the  SUAS-O  controlling  the  UA  has  not  indicated either  awareness  or  initiation  of  an  avoidance  maneuver,  the  observer  directs  an  avoidance maneuver.  Advise the SUAS-O when reported traffic is no longer a factor. 8.5.  Post  Flight  Requirements.  Complete  Operators  Flight  Log  after  each  flight  (to  include simulator flights) or as soon as possible in contingency operations.  Every operator is required to record  his/her  flight    to  capture  all  the  information  required  for  entering  into  SUASMAN  and maintain  the  log  until  all  flights  have  been  entered  into  transferred  to  SUASMAN  as  soon  as possible.  (T-1).  Exception: AFMC is exempt from the requirement to use SUASMAN.  Flight logs  are  used  to  track  flight  hours  for  each  specific  SUAS,  which  shall  be  used  to  determine currency,  trend  analysis  and  verify  flight  hours  for  upgrade  training.    AFMC  shall  develop  a tailored Operators Log for AFMC test operations and USAFA research projects.  (T-1). AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015   35  Chapter 9 ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 9.1.  General.  Conduct of flight operations that deviate from the briefed mission for reasons of adverse  weather,  low  fuel/battery  state,  system  abnormalities,  or  other  unforeseen  event  are defined as “abnormal” and require specific actions. 9.2.  Initial  Actions.  Maintain  aircraft  control  and  situational  awareness.    The  general  priority order  of  “Aviate,  Navigate,  Communicate”  is  the  most  effective  method  of  handling  abnormal events.    Well  integrated  crews  frequently  accomplish  these  tasks  in  parallel  but  the  priorities remain  in  order.  First  priority  shall  always  be  to  maintain  control  of  the  aircraft  and  retain situational awareness.  (T-1).  Loss of the aircraft due to loss of situational awareness makes the rest  of  the  process  irrelevant.    While  aviating,  the  crew  analyzes  the  situation  and  takes  the proper action to mitigate the situation.  Navigation shall be the second priority.  (T-1).  Correct analysis of the situation leads to the decision to continue the mission, navigate to a safe area for further  action,  or  navigate  towards  a  suitable  recovery  location  while  remaining  clear  of unauthorized airspace.  Communicating information to appropriate agencies is the third priority. SUAS  operations  typically  require  airspace  control  agencies  to  be  notified  of  any  loss  of  link, navigational difficulty, or UA loss and mission control agencies to be notified of any change in mission capability. 9.3.  Emergency  Procedures    (EP).  Each  SUAS  technical  order,  operator’s  manual,  or equivalent  vendor-provided  publication  specifies  critical  emergency  procedures  which  shall  be committed to memory and acted upon without reference to a checklist.  These critical emergency procedures  are  distinguished  from  non-critical  EPs  by  bold  print  (“Bold  Face  Emergency Procedures”).    When  encountering  a  system  malfunction,  maintain  aircraft  control,  analyze  the situation  and  select  the  appropriate  emergency  procedure.    Execute  the  appropriate  bold  face procedure  in  the  order  specified.    (T-1).    The  non-flying  crewmember  shall  back  up  the  flying crewmember to insure correct selection and execution of the EP.  (T-1).  The crew shall execute non- critical EPs with reference to the appropriate checklist.  (T-1). 9.4.  Impound GCS and UA.  Impound the affected GCS and UA and preserve operations data for any of the following: 9.4.1.  Uncommanded control inputs not resolved by published emergency procedures. 9.4.2.  Loss of UA control resulting in forced landing or uncontrolled flyaway. 9.4.3.  Spill out from authorized airspace.  Release the GCS for operations only after data is preserved  and  the  GCS  is  released  by  the  investigating  authority.    An  operations  check  is required to verify correct function before the GCS is returned to service. 9.4.4.  Loss of UA or non-repairable damage. Report IAW paragraph 11.3.   36  AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 10 SAFETY/OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT 10.1.  General.  Commanders  shall  implement  an  Operational  Risk  Management  (ORM)  and mishap  prevention  program.    (T-1).    Commanders  shall  integrate  ORM  into  SUAS  mission planning  and  execution  at  every  level.    (T-1).    ORM  is  a  decision-making  process  to systematically evaluate possible courses of action, identify risks and benefits, and determine the best course of action for any given situation.  ORM enables commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals to maximize operational capabilities while limiting all dimensions of risk by applying a simple, systematic process appropriate for all personnel and functions both on- and  off-duty.    Application  of  the  ORM  process  ensures  more  consistent  results,  while  ORM techniques  and  tools  add  rigor  to  the  traditional  approach  to  mission  accomplishment,  thereby directly strengthening the Air Force's war fighting posture.  See Attachment 3 for sample ORM worksheet and flight authorization. Exception: AFMC shall develop a tailored Operational Risk Management (ORM) worksheet and shall define the ORM program requirements for AFMC test operations and USAFA research projects.  (T-1). 10.2.  ORM  Principles.  Four  principles  govern  all  actions  associated  with  the  management  of risk.  These principles, continuously employed, are applicable before, during, and after all tasks and operations. 10.2.1.  Accept no unnecessary risk.  All Air Force missions and daily routines involve risk.  The most logical choices for accomplishing a mission are those that accomplish the mission while  exposing  personnel  and  resources  to  the  lowest  acceptable  risk.    Risk  without  a commensurate reward is unnecessary. 10.2.2.  Make  risk  decisions  at  the  appropriate  level.    Making  risk  decisions  at  the appropriate level establishes accountability.  Those accountable for the success or failure of the mission must participate in the risk decision process. 10.2.3.  Accept  risk  when  benefits  outweigh  the  costs.    All  potential  benefits  should  be compared  to  all  potential  costs.    The  process  of  weighing  risks  against  opportunities  and benefits  helps  to  maximize  unit  capability.    Even  high  risk  endeavors  may  be  undertaken when there is a well-founded basis to believe the sum of the benefits exceeds the sum of the costs. 10.2.4.  Integrate ORM into operations and planning at all levels.  To effectively apply risk management,  commanders  must  dedicate  time  and  resources  to  integrate  ORM  principles into planning and operational processes.  Risk  assessment  of operations is  supportive when it’s  done  as  a  normal  way  of  conducting  a  mission,  not  an  add-on  process  performed  by people not otherwise involved. 10.3.  Authorized Uses.  SUAS shall be used in a safe and controlled manner and shall be used for  official  purposes  only.  (T-1).  The  SUAS-O  must  conduct  a  thorough  Operational  Risk Management  assessment  prior  to  any  SUAS  mission  IAW  Air  Force  Pamphlet  90-902, Operational Risk Management Guidelines and Tools.  (T-1). 10.4.  Human Factors.  Human factor issues are of particular concern in establishing guidelines for  safe  UA  flight.    UA  flight  presents  human  challenges  different  from  and  beyond  those  of AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015   37  manned flight primarily because the aircraft and its operator are not collocated.  As compared to the pilot of a manned aircraft, an SUAS-O can be said to perform in relative “sensory isolation” from the vehicle under his/her control. 10.4.1.  Small  UAS  can  present  operators  with  long  periods  of  low  workload  which contributes  to  “vigilance-based  stress.”    Tasks  associated  with  operating  SUAS  such  as sustained  visual  scanning  of  displays  requires  constant  attention  and  SUAS-Os  and supervisors must be aware that alertness deteriorates over time.   38  AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 11 REPORTING PROCEDURES 11.1.  General.  HQ AFSOC has been tasked by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to track and report the mission capable status of all AF SUAS.  Air Force units with an operational SUAS  mission  shall  keep  SUAS  status  updated  and  current  in  SUASMAN.    (T-1).    OSD  can generate a mission capable status report from within SUASMAN. Timely notification of SUAS mishaps  is  required  in  order  to  ensure  accuracy  of  AF  SUAS  status  reporting.    Exception: AFMC and USAFA need not report status for test and/or research systems. 11.2.  System Reporting. 11.2.1.  Units  shall  track  each  system  by  the  manufacturers’  serial  number  and/or  system number.  (T-1).  Mission capable status shall be determined by the complementary readiness of the following selected major subcomponents: UA, Ground Control Station (GCS), Remote Video  Terminal  (RVT)  and  payloads  (typically  electro-optical  (EO)  and  infrared  (IR) sensors).    The  mission  capable  status  shall  be  reported  IAW  paragraphs  11.2.2  through 11.2.3. 11.2.2.  Terms.  The following terms shall be used to categorize systems, i.e., Fully Mission Capable (FMC), Partially Mission Capable (PMC) and Non-Mission Capable (NMC). 11.2.2.1.  FMC means every UA, GCS, RVT and payload in a system is mission capable. 11.2.2.2.  PMC means at least one UA, one GCS, and one payload is mission capable. 11.2.2.3.  NMC  means  either  all  of  the  UA,  the  GCS,  or  all  payloads  are  not  mission capable.  Any  one  of  these  conditions  shall  make  the  entire  system  NMC.    Note:  The reporting  unit  may  subjectively  downgrade  system  status  to  NMC  if  the  system  has  no operational  night  payload  (but  an  operational  day  payload)  when  a  night  payload  is required for successful mission accomplishment. 11.2.3.  Status  Reporting  Schedule.    Equipment  status  shall  be  continually  updated  in  the SUASMAN.  This enables higher headquarters to determine current equipment status. 11.3.  Mishap Reporting: 11.3.1.  Mishaps resulting in the loss of an aircraft, non-repairable damage (does not apply to consumable or normal wear and tear parts) or requiring depot level repair, injury to personnel or damage to property shall be reported to the unit safety office within 48 hours.  (T-2).  The unit  safety  office  shall  forward  the  report  to  using  and  lead  commands  within  5  duty  days.  Impound the affected GCS and UA IAW paragraph 9.4. 11.3.2.  Units conducting SUAS operations under the provisions of an approved FAA COA or  Class  G  operation  IAW  other  DOD/FAA  MOA  shall  immediately  provide  initial notification  to  HQ  AFSOC/A3OU  via  email  (AFSOC.A3OU.WF@us.af.mil)  or  phone (850-884-4064  /  4074  /  5462;  cell  850-902-7041)  after  any  incident,  accident,  or  mishap prior to conducting any additional flights.  (T-0). 11.3.3.  The  unit  safety  office  (or  higher)  will  report  mishaps  using  the  Air  Force  Safety Automated  System  (AFSAS)  IAW  AFI  91-204,  Safety  Investigations  and  Reports,  and AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015   39  AFMAN  91-223,  Aviation  Safety  Investigations  and  Reports.    (T-1).    Reports  are  kept indefinitely in the AFSAS.  The unit may maintain hard copies IAW AFI 91-204. 11.3.4.  Mishaps that result in minor damage (does not apply to consumable or normal wear and  tear  parts)  that  can  be  repaired  at  home  station  and  do  not  meet  Class  A,  B,  C  or  D thresholds  shall  be  reported  to  the  unit  safety  representative  who  shall  determine  if  an AFSAS report is warranted.  (T-2).  System malfunctions or anomalies that result in loss of control  or  damage  shall  be  reported  through  the  unit  safety  office  to  the  MAJCOM  Safety office HQ AFSOC/A3 within 7 duty days.  (T-2). 11.3.5.  For  the  purposes  of  trend  analysis,  unintentional  LOL  incidents  (other  than  brief incidents where link is regained and mission continued) shall be reported in SUASMAN and IAW AFMAN 91-223.  Exception: AFMC test operations and USAFA research projects are exempt from the requirement to use SUASMAN but shall report these incidents IAW AFMC guidance. 11.3.6.  Use  the  SUAS  Incident/Mishap  Worksheet  in  Attachment  2  to  capture  required information.  Transfer  this  information  to  AFSOC  Form  97  (or  MAJCOM  equivalent)  upon return  from  the  field.    (T-2).  Incident/mishap  reports  shall  be  processed  IAW  MAJCOM supplements to AFI 91204.  (T-1).  The names of the operators shall not be released to non-USAF agencies without the permission of the Air Force Representative to the FAA (AFREP) coordinating  the  investigation.    (T-1).    Combat  losses  shall  be  reported  to  MAJCOMS  and HQ  AFSOC/A3OU  within  48  hours  via  e-mail  to  AFSOC.A3OU.WF@us.af.mil  /  SIPR: afsoc.UAV@afsoc.af.smil.mil  or  Fax:  DSN  579-2026,  Commercial  (850)  884-2026.  HQ AFSOC/A3OU shall then forward to AFFSA and HAF/A3O-AS. 11.3.7.  Use  standard  security  markings  and  classified  handling  procedures  for  classified reports. Do not enter classified information into AFSAS. 11.3.8.  Refer all inquiries about SUAS mishaps to the appropriate Public Affairs (PA) office. 11.3.9.  Deployed units may relay an incident report via text message in standard line format.  TOD D.

Land—For purpose of this AFI, includes all actions appropriate to transition the UA from flight to  the  ground  (e.g.,  recovery,  wheeled  or  skid  landing,  parafoil  recovery,  deep  stall  landing, arrested engagement, etc.) AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015   43  Lead  SUAS-O—The  SUAS-O  specifically  identified  by  responsible  authority  and  tasked  with the  overall  responsibility  for  the  operation  and  safety  of  the  SUAS  mission.  Equivalent  to  the Pilot-in-Command of a manned aircraft. Maintenance—The inspection, overhauls, repairs, preservation, and/or the replacement of parts, but excludes preventive maintenance. National  Airspace  System  (NAS)—All of the airspace above the surface of the earth over the United States and its possessions. Night—The  time  between  the  end  of  evening  nautical  twilight  and  the  beginning  of  morning nautical twilight converted to local time. Restricted  area—Airspace designated in FAR 73 within which the flight of aircraft, while not prohibited, is subject to restriction(s). Special Use Airspace (SUA)—Airspace designated by the FAA with specific vertical and lateral limits,  established  for  the  purpose  of  containing  hazardous  activities  or  activity  that  could  be hazardous  to  nonparticipating  aircraft.  Limitation  on  nonparticipating  aircraft  may  range  from absolute  exclusion  to  complete  freedom  of  use  within  certain  areas,  depending  upon  activity being conducted. Comprises Restricted, Warning, and Prohibited areas. SUAS Instructor (SUAS-I)—A SUAS crewmember who conducts training and assessments of SUAS-Os  and  SUAS  unit  trainers  in  designated  SUAS  and  promotes  safety  among  aircrew members.   Training   and   assessments   include   air   vehicle   operation,   qualification, unit employment, visual flight, and crew performance. SUAS-O—An individual who has completed IQT in a specific UAS. Takeoff—For  purposes  of  this  AFI,  includes  all  actions  required  to  transition  the  UA  from ground to flight (e.g., launch, throwing, catapulting, wheeled takeoff, etc.) Traffic pattern—The traffic flow that is prescribed for aircraft landing at, taxiing on, or taking off from an airport or airfield. Training  mission—Missions  flown  for  flight  qualification,  refresher,  or  proficiency/currency training; ATP requirements, and authorized training exercises. Unmanned Aircraft (UA)—An aircraft or balloon that does not carry a human operator and is capable  of  flight  under  remote  control  or  autonomous  programming.  (Joint  Publication  3-52). Also called AV. A UA may be expendable or recoverable, carries a payload, is not operated for sport or hobby, and does not transport passengers or crew. For purposes of compliance with 14 CFR 1, subchapter A, part 1.1., UAs are to be considered “aircraft,” typically either an “airplane” or “rotorcraft,” as defined in 14 CFR 1, subchapter A, part 1.1. (FAA refers to these aircraft as remotely operated aircraft). Unmanned  Aircraft  System  (UAS)—That  system  whose  components  include  the  necessary equipment, network, and personnel to control an unmanned aircraft. (Joint Publication 3-52).    44  AFI11-502V3  21 AUGUST 2015 Attachment 2 SUAS INCIDENT/MISHAP WORKSHEET Table A2.1.  SUAS Incident/Mishap Worksheet.
