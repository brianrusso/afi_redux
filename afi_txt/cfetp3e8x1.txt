The CFETP will provide our Airmen with a clear career path to success and instill consistency in all aspects of our career field training. The CFETP consists of two parts used by the supervisor to plan, manage, and control training within the career field. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. •  Section A provides general information about how the CFETP will be used. •  Section  B  identifies  career  field  progression  information,  duties  and  responsibilities, training strategies, and the career field path. •  Section C associates each skill-level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, and training). •  Section D indicates resource contraints. •  Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. Part II includes the following: •  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) to include duties, tasks, and technical references to support Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, and correspondence course requirements. •  Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if an Airman has satisfied training requirements. •  Section C identifies available support materials.   •  Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses, and exportable courseware. •  Section  E  identifies  MAJCOM-unique  training  requirements  supervisors  can  use  to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs. •  Section F identifies home station training references and courses material required for this specialty in support of contingency/wartime training. •  Section G identifies the EOD Standard Training Package which prescribes the minimum monthly/semi-annual/annual  training/exercise  requirements  for  all  active  duty  EOD personnel assigned below wing level. •  Section H advertises Advanced EOD Training Course Training Standards. Note: At unit level, supervisors and trainers must use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this guide. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their careers.  This plan will enable us to train 5 CFETP 3E8X1, 1 MAR 2016 (Incorporating Change 2 Dated 1 FEB 2017) today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs.  At the unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this guide.   6 CFETP 3E8X1, 1 MAR 2016 (Incorporating Change 2 Dated 1 FEB 2017) ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED  Advanced Distributive Learning (ADL).

The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the EOD career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  The training RECOMMENDATIONS were made by members of the 9-13 July 2012 Specialty Training Requirements Team (STRT) conducted at Eglin AFB, training DECISIONS were accomplished by the 8-11 July 2013 Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) conducted via telecom.  B3.1.  Initials Skills Training.  The initial skill course was reviewed for content.  Additions, deletions, and modifications were made to the course.  Wartime training tasks were identified and validated.  B3.1.1.  EOD Preliminary Course:  Preliminary Course training requirements were included in the Specialty Training Standard, which will enable training management to structure the course to best meet the needs of the career field.  B3.1.2.    Naval  School  EOD  Course:    The  Specialty  Training  Standard  (STS)  was  adjusted  to represent current curriculum.  Due to this being an Inter-Service school with the Navy being the executive manager, training decisions are made by the Technical Training Acceptance Board and the School’s Commanding Officer.  Recommendations can be made by the U&TW, however, it requires Joint EOD Program acceptance.  B3.2.    Five  Level  Upgrade  Training  Requirements.    Full  training  requirements  review  was conducted and change needs were identified for 5-Level upgrade requirements.  B3.2.1.  The STRT recommended additional 5-Level Core Tasks and the U&TW confirmed the addition.  The additional 5-Level Core Tasks was the result of the inclusion of additional wartime related  tasks,  line  item  detailed  sub-tasks  and  National  Fire  Prevention  Agency  training requirements.  B3.2.2.  3E8X1 EOD Journeyman Career Development Course (CDC) Program.   B3.2.2.1.    The  3E8X1  EOD  Journeyman  CDC  program  is  being  reformatted  as  an  Electronic Resource-CDC  (ER-CDC).    The  ER-CDC  program  will  replace  the  current  written  material contained within the CDC with references for trainees to research and self-study.  The overall 21 CFETP 3E8X1, 1 MAR 2016 / (Incorporating Change 2 Dated 1 FEB 2017) PART I structure will remain the same, however, the scope of coverage will grow vastly and better mirror 5-Skill Level upgrade requirements.  B3.2.2.2.  The 3E8X1 CDC writer is tasked to develop and use, in coordination with Air Force Career Development Academy Course Development, a syllabus study guide format for future CDC materials  in  lieu  of  the  traditional  CDC  manuscript  style.  The  new  format  will  focus  on  the knowledge component of the 5 Level Core Task and will incorporate measurements that will be used as part of 5-Level Upgrade.  The EOD CDC Study Guide and referenced study material (EOD Technical Orders, AFIs, and EOD Joint Publications) will be the backbone of this transformed program.  Standardized learning objectives will be identified within the syllabus and individual module study sheets.  The program course number with formatted study exercises, unit review exercises and end of course tests will be maintained with this transformation.  B3.3.  Seven Level Upgrade Training Requirements.  Full training requirements review was conducted and change needs were identified for 7-Level upgrade requirements.  B3.3.1.  The STRT recommended additional 7-Level Core Tasks and the U&TW confirmed the addition.  The additional 7-Level Core Tasks was the result of the inclusion of additional wartime related tasks and National Fire Prevention Agency training requirements.  B3.3.2.  7-Level Craftsman Course Restructure.  Course change initiative history was reviewed and training requirements for “operationally” focused curriculum were validated.  The change to operational  requirements  was  unanimously  decided.    366  TRS/TRR  is  tasked  to  develop  an “operationally” focused course based on the proficiency codes identified by the U&TW.  The course development will include curriculum, infrastructure, materials and the equipment necessary to accomplish instruction and exercises relative to in-garrison EOD operations.  B3.4.  Proficiency Training.  Any additional knowledge and skill requirements that were not taught through initial skills or upgrade training are assigned as continuation training.  Purpose of continuation training is to provide training exceeding minimum upgrade training requirements with emphasis on present and future duty positions.  MAJCOMs must develop a continuation-training program that ensures personnel in the EOD career field receive the necessary training at the appropriate point in their careers.  The training program will identify both mandatory and optional training requirements.  B3.5.  Supplemental Training.  Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and the Training Committee reviewed  supplemental  training  courses  for  technical  accuracy  and  validated  the  courses  were deemed necessary to fully support AFSC career progression/operational capability.   B4.    Community  College  of  the  Air  Force  (CCAF)  Academic  Programs.    Airmen  are automatically  enrolled  in  CCAF  upon  completion  of  basic  military  training.    CCAF  is  one  of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions; however, it’s the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military enlisted personnel.  The college is regionally accredited through Air University  by  the  Southern  Association  of  Colleges  and  Schools  Commission  on  Colleges (SACSCOC)  to  award Associate  of  Applied  Science (AAS)  degrees  designed  for  specific  Air Force occupational specialties and is the largest multi-campus community college in the world.  22 CFETP 3E8X1, 1 MAR 2016 / (Incorporating Change 2 Dated 1 FEB 2017) PART I Upon  completion  of  basic  military  training  and  assignment  to  an  AF  career  field,  all  enlisted personnel are registered in a CCAF degree program and are afforded the opportunity to obtain an AAS degree.

This section is reserved.”   41 CFETP 3E8X1, 1 MAR 2016 / (Incorporating Change 2 Dated 1 FEB 2017) PART II  SECTION A - SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD  A1.  Implementation.  This STS will be used to identify technical training provided by AETC for the 3-level Naval School EOD Apprentice pipeline course and the 7-level Team Leader Course.  A2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, and in collaboration with the Civil Engineer, Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), it is mandatory for all civil engineers, regardless of duty assignment, to use an automated training record.  The automated training record currently being utilized to document upgrade and qualification training is the Air Force Training Record (AFTR) and the application is located on the CE-VLC.  A2.1.  Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References). Lists the most common tasks, knowledge, and supporting technical references (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.  A2.2.  Column 2 (Core Tasks).  Identifies core tasks (specialty-wide training requirements) by an asterisk (*) in the appropriate skill level sub-column.  As a minimum, trainees must complete hands-on certification on all core, critical and diamond tasks for skill level upgrade.  A2.2.1.  Wartime Tasks.  All tasks in the 3-level course column are considered wartime tasks.  In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a streamlined training environment.  A2.2.2.  Diamond Tasks.  Tasks identified by a diamond (♦) are considered contingency/war task and are critical to the career field.  Equipment shortfalls at most locations have created problems with actual hands-on certification of these tasks.  In instances where required equipment is not available  for  hands-on  training,  reading  the  applicable  EOD  technical  orders/manufacturer manuals as references until equipment becomes available is all that is required for upgrade training.  A2.3.  Column 3 (Certification for OJT).  Used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training  requirements.    Use  the  automated  training  record  application  to  document  individual qualifications.    Task  certification  of  core,  critical  and  diamond  tasks  require  a  training completion date and initials of the trainee, trainer, and certifier.  All non-core tasks require training completion date and initials of the trainee and trainer only.  A2.4.    Column  4  (Proficiency  Codes  Used  to  Indicate  Training/Information  Provided).  Indicates formal training and correspondence course requirements.  It shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task, knowledge and the career  knowledge  provided  by  formal  courses,  CDC,  distance  learning  (DL)  and  web-based training (WBT).  See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit education and training manager for current CDC listings.  A2.5.  Qualitative Requirements.  Contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by WBT, resident training and career development courses.  42 PART II  CFETP 3E8X1, 1 MAR 2016 / (Incorporating Change 2 Dated 1 FEB 2017) A2.6.  Job Qualification Standard (JQS).  The STS becomes the JQS for OJT when placed in automated training application and used according to AFI 36-2201.  For OJT, the tasks in Column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level.  “Go” means the individual can perform the task without  assistance  and  meets  local  requirements  for  accuracy,  timeliness,  and  correct  use  of procedures.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  A2.6.1.  Documentation.  Document and certify completion of training.  A2.6.1.1.    Duty  position.    Duty  position  titles  and  task  requirements  will  be  developed  and identified  by  the  workcenter  supervisor  and  loaded  into  the  automated  training  application.  Completion of core, critical and diamond tasks are mandatory for all duty positions.  Ensure the correct duty position title is listed under Profile 1 section of the trainee’s automated training record.    A2.6.1.2.  Duty position change.  To change a trainee duty position title select the Profile section under the trainee record and select the new duty position from the dropdown box, entry the date entered new duty position and save the update.  Under the trainee JQS section you will see the new tasks associated with the selected duty position.  The trainee and trainer/certifier will need to sign off the tasks associated with the new position.  A2.6.3.  Transcribing from previous versions to the new CFETP.  Most items should transcribe automatically during the update of the new CFETP.  The UTM and supervisor must conduct a review of the new STS to identify any new core, diamond, or non-core tasks and add those tasks to their duty positions.  A2.6.3.1.  Previous training certification not listed  If previous training certification is not listed in the individual record, select the parent task to be transcribed, check the task title(s) block, and click on the transcribe button.  Enter the date of the original certification and sign off the task(s).  The  trainee  will  then  sign  off  the  task(s)  to  finalize  the  transcription  of  previous  training certification.  The automated application will place an entry into the trainee 623a and must be acknowledged by the transcriber and trainee.  A2.6.3.2.  Transcribing external training certification.  If a trainee attended a formal training course and received appropriate accreditation, select the 623 III section of the user’s automated training record and locate the course title in the master task list, then enter the completion date.  If the course title is not listed, contact the UTM to have it loaded from the master catalog.  If it is not listed in  the  master  catalog  contact the  EOD  CFM  at  AFCEC  to  have it loaded  in  the  master catalog.   43 PART II  CFETP 3E8X1, 1 MAR 2016 / (Incorporating Change 2 Dated 1 FEB 2017)  A2.6.4.    Documenting  Career  Knowledge.    When  a  CDC  is  not  available,  the  supervisor identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover all mandatory items specified in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).  For two-time CDC exam failures, the unit commander will take appropriate action IAW AFI 36-2201. Note: Career knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.  A2.6.5.  Decertification.  When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a task, the supervisor shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box next to the task title.  The supervisor shall select the Decertify button on the screen menu and enter a 623a comment explaining why the task was decertified, and then enter the Airman into qualification training.  The individual is recertified using the normal certification process.  A2.6.6.  Recertification.  When an Airman is required to be recertified on a previous task due to annual or bi-annual requirements.  The supervisor shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box next to the task title and select the Recertify button on the screen and entry the dates the recertification was completed.    A2.6.7.  Training Standard.  Tasks are trained and certified to the “go” level.  Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets the local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures.  This equates to a 3c in the proficiency code key.   A2.7.  Specialty Training Standard.  The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Specialty Knowledge Tests are developed at the USAF Airman Advancement Division by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based  upon  study  references  listed  in  the  Enlisted  Promotions  References  and  Requirements Catalog.  Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2605, AF Military Testing System.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces.  A3.    Recommendations.    Comments  and  recommendations  are  invited  concerning  quality  of training AETC graduates receive.

EOD Preliminary Course (J3AQR3E831 01AB) Sheppard AFB TX.  The standard is 80%  on  written  examinations.    Standards  for  performance  measurement  are  indicated  in  the objectives and delineated on the individual progress checklist.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check or performance test, and students may be required to repeat all or parts of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.  B2.2.    NAVSCOLEOD  Apprentice  Course  (JBABN3E831  00NC)  Eglin  AFB,  FL.    The minimum  passing  score  is  85%.    Standards  for  student  measurements  are  indicated  in  the objectives. Students are normally afforded a retest if at least 85% is not attained.  A Naval School EOD Joint Academic Review Board (ARB) is normally conducted for students that do not attain a passing score on retest.  Training continuation is decided by the Commanding Officer, Naval School EOD, based on academic records, recommendations from ARB and 366 TRS Detachment 3 Commander.  B3.  Proficiency Level.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level, which means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.  B4.  Course Objective List.  These objectives are listed in the sequence taught by Blocks of Instruction, per AETCI 36-2641, Technical and Basic Military Training Development.  B4.1.  Initial Skills Course.

Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to identify the tasks, training references, and training sources available in support of contingency/wartime training.  Civil Engineer forces will train to meet  the  full  range  of  tasks  expected  in  the  contingency  environment.    Training  ranges  from knowledge-type training conducted in a classroom, to task-oriented hands-on training conducted in the field.  These training requirements, frequencies, and sources are listed in AFI 10-209, RED HORSE Program and AFI 10-210, Prime Base Emergency Engineer Force (BEEF) Program.  F2.  Home Station Training (HST).  HST training is knowledge-based and hands-on training. The CE Commander ensures training is provided and documented and arranges for subject matter experts  to  conduct  training  as  required.  This  includes  training  primarily  accomplished  during Prime  BEEF  training  days.  Units  must  make  every  effort  to  incorporate  realism  into  their respective HST training programs. Field gear (to include primary weapons) must be used as the “norm”  rather  than  the  exception  whenever  training  requirements  such  as  security  activities, convoy  operations,  defensive  fighting  positions,  etc.  are  accomplished.  Units  will  use demonstration performance packages, qualification training packages, other multimedia training packages, and AF CE standardized lesson plans to present the material. MAJCOMs and the ANG may develop and require other training materials to accomplish knowledge-based training.    F2.1.  EOD (3E8X1) Specific Training.  Exercises are to be accomplished, at a minimum, on an annual  basis.    EOD  Flights  are  encouraged  to  increase  the  frequency  in  areas  they  feel  are necessary.  F2.2.  Aerospace System/Vehicles Exercise.  See AFI 32-3001 and Aerospace Vehicle Launch and Recovery AFTTPs for performance expectations  F2.3.    Conventional  Ordnance  (Peacetime)  Exercise.    See  AFI  32-3001  and  UXO  Recovery Operations AFTTPs for performance expectations.  F2.4.  Recovery of Airbases Denied by Ordnance (RADBO).  See AFI 32-3001 and RADBO CONOPS/AFTTPs for performance expectations.  F2.5.  Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Exercise (One Peacetime/One Contingency).  See AFI 32-3001, IED, and Force Protection CONOPS/AFTTPs for performance expectations.  F2.6.    Weapon  of  Mass  Destruction  (WMD)  Exercise.    See  AFI  32-3001  and  WMD CONOPS/AFTTPs for performance expectations.  F2.7.    Nuclear  Weapon  Response  -  Broken  Arrow  Exercise.  See  AFI  32-3001  and  Nuclear Accident/Incident  Response  CONOPS/AFTTPs  for  performance  expectations.    ARC  may complete this requirement via a table-top exercise vice a practical exercise in the field.  F2.8.  Chemical/Biological Exercise (Contingency – including disposal).  See AFI 32-3001 and Chemical/Biological CONOPS/AFTTPs for performance expectations.   54 PART II  CFETP 3E8X1, 1 MAR 2016 / (Incorporating Change 2 Dated 1 FEB 2017) F2.9.  Active Range Clearance War Skills.  Complete Range Support Tasking within 48 months after graduating from EOD School. Complete one-time follow-on training within 60 months after award of 7-skill level.  See AFI 32-3001 and Range Clearance Operations AFTTP for performance expectations.  F3.  Combat Skills Training (CST).  CST must be institutionalized as an integral part of any HST program.  Observations, innovations and lessons learned (OIL) have taught us the importance of maintaining a higher level of combat readiness. Although the inclusion of combat skills-focused training  into  HST  does  not  fully  prepare  CE  personnel  to  work  in  a  high  threat  combat environment, the steps taken to enhance training will help elevate units to a readiness level capable of supporting safe and effective operations in low to medium threat combat environments.  F4.  Mission Essential Equipment Training (MEET).  Wartime or contingency environments often involve the use of specialized and unique mission-essential equipment that civil engineers do  not  use  in  their  day-to-day  operations.    Due  to  the  cost  and  complexity,  mission  essential contingency equipment and trainer expertise are not commonly found at CONUS installations.  Personnel must be hands-on certified and the certification documented in their CFETP.  AFI 10-210, Attachment 4, identifies minimum number of personnel to be trained, positions by specialty, frequencies and Chapter 2 identifies the locations of training sites.  Inadequate training on these key equipment items can negatively impact Air Force contingency operations.  F5.  Silver Flag Exercise Training.  Focus is on performance of critical contingency tasks in a team environment.  The training focuses on bare base bed-down and sustainment operations using hands-on training with basic expeditionary airfield resources (BEAR) equipment in a realistic bed-down environment.  Where possible, combat skills are added to the curriculum to ensure realism and help fortify a warrior mentality throughout the training.  All CE personnel who fill Unit Type Code (UTC) positions will receive team training at Silver Flag Exercise Sites.  F6.    AF  Expeditionary  (ES)  Training  Requirement.    AETC,  as  lead  MAJCOM  for  AF  ES training, revamped ancillary home-station and advanced (mission specific) expeditionary skills training plans to standardize and synchronize training across the force.  Detailed requirements for AF ES training is available in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, Chapter 8.   F7.  EOD Combat Skills Training – 823 RED HORSE SQ DET 1/Combat Battlefield Ready Airman (CoBRA).  It delivers critical skills and brings individuals and teams together to form a unit prior to deploying into a high risk combat environment in support of Air Component and Joint Force Commanders.  F8.  Expeditionary Combat Support-Training and Certification Center (ECS-TCC).  The ECS-TCC located at Dobbins ARB, GA enlists AFRC Professional Development Center certified instructors  to  administer  and  facilitate  MEET  training  courses  for  Civil  Engineer  personnel (classroom  and  hands-on).    The  EOD  training  is  individual-focused  and  specifically  targets specialized  training  to  include:  CFETP  Core  Task  certification,  STP  exercise  support,  ARTs familiarization,  multiple  detector  IED  detector  training  and  just  in  time  requested  specialized training.  55 PART II  CFETP 3E8X1, 1 MAR 2016 / (Incorporating Change 2 Dated 1 FEB 2017) F9.
