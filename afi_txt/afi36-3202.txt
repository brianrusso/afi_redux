Authority for Separation.  Members who separate from active service are issued separation documents as authorized by the law (Attachment 1) and DOD and United States (US) Air Force (USAF)  separation  policies  and  procedures.    Do  not  cite  this  instruction  as  an  authority  for separation.  AFI 36-2102, Base-Level Relocation Procedures, tells how to process a member for separation at base level.  The War and Mobilization Procedures are in Attachment 2. Section B—Preparing the Documents 2.  What Are Separation Documents Used For? 2.1.  DD  Form  256AF,  Honorable  Discharge,  is  used  to  discharge  members  who  separate from the AF with an honorable characterization and not released to the Reserve components.  Members who fulfill their obligation with the reserve forces are issued this certificate when discharged with an honorable service characterization.  This certificate is issued to all active duty enlisted members who reenlist within 24 hours of their separation. 2.2.  DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty, meets the legal requirements for issuing a discharge certificate (Title 10, U.S.C., section 1168) and: 2.2.1.  Provides  the  military  services  with  information  about  military  personnel  for administrative purposes. 2.2.2.  Helps determine eligibility for reenlistment. 2.2.3.  Provides  separating  members  with    brief,  clear  records  of  their  active  military service at the time they are transferred, released, discharged, or retired. 2.2.4.  Provides  government  agencies  with  information  they  need  to  administer  the federal  and  state  laws  that  apply  to  persons  who  have  been  discharged,  otherwise released, or transferred to a Reserve component. 2.3.  DD Form  214WS helps  personnel  to  prepare DD Form  214 and to  make sure the data entered on the form is accurate. 2.4.  DD  Form  215,  Correction  to  DD  Form  214,  Certificate  of  Release  or  Discharge From Active Duty, corrects errors found after a DD Form 214 is issued or completes a DD Form  214  with  up-to-date  information.    Only  the  agencies  listed  in  Table  1.  and  paragraph 18.2. may prepare this form. 3.  Who Issues Separation Documents? 3.1.  Normally, the MPF issues discharge or release-from-active-duty separation documents.  Exceptions are: AFI36-3202  22 NOVEMBER 2005 5 3.1.1.  Retirements Branch (HQ AFPC/DPPRR), and HQ Air Reserve Personnel Center, Reference  Services  Branch  (HQ  ARPC/DRSS),  issue  separation  documents  when  they are instructed to do so by the AF Board of Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) or the AF Discharge Review Board (AFDRB). 3.1.2.  HQ  AFPC/DPPDS  issues  discharge  certificates  (DD  Forms  256AF)  to  members who  are  removed  from  the  temporary  disability  retired  list  (TDRL)  and  discharged;  or in  AFI  36-2602,  Active  Duty  Service according Determinations for Civilian or Contractual Groups. the  guidelines  contained to 3.1.3.  The  Air  National  Guard  of  the  US  (ANGUS)  or  USAF  Reserve  (USAFR) servicing  MPF  or  ARPC/DR  (for  individual  mobilization  augmentees  [IMA])  that services the unit of assignment prepares DD Form 214 in accordance with paragraph 4.1. for Air Reserve Component (ARC) member who completes 90 continuous calendar days or more of active duty or active duty for training (ADT), or an initial active duty training tour. 4.  When to Use DD Forms 214 and 256AF. 4.1.  Issue DD Form 214 as required by Table 2. 4.2.  Do not issue any other discharge certificate to: 4.2.1.  Enlisted  members  of  the  Regular  AF  who  are  released  from  active  duty  and transferred to a Reserve Component. 4.2.2.  Reserve  Component  members  who  are  released  from  active  duty  and  then  revert back to their assigned reserve component in a ready reserve status. 4.2.3.  Members  who  are  retired.    NOTE:    See  AFIs  36-3212,  Physical  Evaluation  for Retention,  Retirement,  and  Separation  and  36-3203,  Service  Retirements,  concerning retirement certificates. 4.2.4.  Officers  vacating  an  appointment  by  accepting  an  incompatible  office  or  civil office.    NOTE:    See  Title  10,  U.S.C.,  section  973,  Duties:  Officers  on  Active  Duty; Performance of Civil Functions Restricted, for more information. 4.2.5.  Airmen  discharged  to  accept  appointments  as  commissioned  officers  of  the  AF without a break in active service. 4.2.6.  Members  discharged  from  active  military  service  with  an  entry-level  separation, whose  discharge  is  under  honorable  conditions  (general),  or  whose  service  is characterized as under other than honorable conditions. 4.2.7.  Members  discharged  under  honorable  conditions  (general),  under  other  than honorable conditions, or bad conduct or dishonorable discharges. 4.2.8.  Members who reenlist within 24 hours of their previous discharge. 4.3.  HQ AFPC/DPPRS can direct you to issue DD Form 214 under other conditions. 4.4.  Issue  DD  Form  256AF  for  an  honorable  discharge  except  when  Reserve  officers  are discharged to accept appointments as Regular commissioned officers.  For entries authorized on discharge certificates, see Table 3. 6 AFI36-3202  22 NOVEMBER 2005 4.5.  ARC members will be issued a DD Form 214 under the following situations: 4.5.1.  Involuntarily  ordered  to  active  duty  in  the  event  of  a  national  emergency  or  war under  Title  10,  U.S.C.,  sections  12301,  12302,  12304,  12306,  12307,  or  688,  will  be issued a DD Form regardless of the number of days served.  The requirement to complete a DD Form 214 due to mobilization is outlined in AFI 10-416, Personnel Readiness and Mobilization. 4.5.2.  Members  who  complete  90  continuous  calendar  days  or  more  of  active  duty  or active duty for training (ADT), or an initial active duty training tour (IADT). 4.5.3.  Active  Guard/Reserve  (AGR)  members  who  complete  90  continuous  calendar days or more of active duty. 4.6.  The Commander, Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC) uses automatic data processing equipment to discharge members of the Air Force Reserve assigned to ARPC. 4.7.  Termination of active duty tour for member’s of an Air Reserve Component serving on active duty orders published by HQ AFPC/DPPAE or the Air Force Academy. 5.  Preparing DD Form 214. 5.1.  Separating agencies ask individuals to complete DD Form 214WS, if applicable. 5.2.  Prepare  the  DD  Form  214  worksheet  using  the  unit  personnel  records  group  (UPRG) information contained in the report of individual personnel (RIP) from AFPC.  Make sure the individual has reviewed the RIP. 5.3.  Use the training documents obtained from the member.  Ask the local office of primary responsibility (OPR) to help resolve questions about particular data items.  Review the data entered on the worksheet to be sure it is right before copying it on the DD Form 214. 5.4.  Use Table 4. to complete DD Form 214.  Put an entry in every item on the form. 5.5.  Type  all  entries  on  the  DD  Form  214  except  the  signature.    Do  not  use  abbreviations except  as  shown  in  Table  4.    Be  sure  that  the  copies  of  DD  Form  214  that  you  send  to government agencies, especially the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department  of Labor, are clear and easy to read. 6.  Continuation Sheets. 6.1.  If the data for items 1 through 17 takes up more space than is allowed, enter as much as possible and note that it is continued on item 18 by stating “(SEE REMARKS)”.  If you need more  space,  continue  on  plain  white  bond  paper.    For  the  continuation  sheet  format,  see Attachment 3.  Make a note at item 18 that there is further information  on the continuation sheet (see Table 4.). 6.2.  Do  not  make  a  continuation  sheet  just  to  note  how  copies  3  and  5  will  be  distributed.  Make these entries on the reverse side of copy 2. 6.3.  Do not put entries for items 23 through 30 on the continuation sheet. 7.  Incomplete DD Form 214. 7.1.  Do  not  delay  a  member's  separation  just  because  you  don't  have  all  the  information needed for DD Form 214. AFI36-3202  22 NOVEMBER 2005 7 7.2.  Try  to  get  the  missing  information.    Ask  the  member's  last  servicing  MPF  or  send  a request by message (MINIMIZE included) to HQ AFPC/DPPRR. 7.3.  If  you  cannot  get  the  data  through  the  Personnel  Data  System  (PDS)  or  one  of  these sources,  fill  out  DD  Form  214  as  completely  as  possible.    If  you  are  the  MPF  Personnel Relocation Element or other separating activity: 7.3.1.  Tell  the  separating  member  that  the  appropriate  agency  (see  Table  1.)  will  issue DD Form 215 when it gets the information it needs. 7.3.2.  Tell  the  separating  member  to  contact  that  agency  if  the  member  doesn't  receive the DD Form 215 within 60 days. 7.3.3.  Note on the DD Form 214, item 18 (Remarks Section) that DD Form 215 is being issued. 7.3.4.  Obtain the missing information as soon as possible. 7.3.5.  If  you  are  still  missing  information  for  DD  Form  215,  write  a  memorandum explaining why  you  need the DD Form 215 and what  you did to try to  get the missing information.  The MPF chief or a similar official in another separation facility signs this memorandum.    Staple  the  memorandum  to  the  front  of  the  unit  personnel  record  group (UPRG)  before  forwarding  it  according  to  AFI  36-2608,  Military  Personnel  Records System. 7.4.  DD Form 214 is an important record of service.  Prepare it as completely and accurately as possible. 7.4.1.  Items 1, 3, 4, 12, and 18 through 30, and DD Form 215, items 1, 3, 5, and 7, are overprinted with a reproducible screen tint using security ink to make alterations readily discernible.  Make no corrections in the screened items. 7.4.2.  Make sure that unavoidable corrections or changes in the unshaded items are neat, easy to read, and initialed on all copies by the authenticating official.  Do not change any of the copies after the original has been delivered.  Tell the recipient that any changes or alterations will void the DD Form 214. Section C—Controlling Forms and Codes 8.  Controlling DD Forms 214 and 215. 8.1.  DD Forms  214 and 215 are important  to former members who seek veterans' benefits, reemployment rights, and unemployment insurance.  They provide authoritative information to civilian and government agencies, who use it to validate veterans' eligibility for benefits.  Because  they  are  important  and  sensitive  forms,  they  are  vulnerable  to  fraud.    Transmit, store, and destroy them in a way that prevents unauthorized use.  Do not discard intact forms. 8.2.  DD Form 214WS is marked worksheet on the body of the form.  Treat this form as you would DD Form 214. 8.3.  The  MPF  commander  or  a  comparable  official  of  each  unit  or  activity  and  of  the agencies  listed  in  Table  1.,  appoints  in  writing  a  commissioned  officer,  noncommissioned 8 AFI36-3202  22 NOVEMBER 2005 officer  (staff  sergeant  or  above),  or  civilian  (general  schedule  [GS]-7or  above)  to  control blank DD Forms 214 and 215 (see Table 4., rule 39). 8.3.1.  The  person  responsible  for  controlling  blank  forms  secures  all  forms  after  duty hours;  destroys  all  obsolete  forms;  clearly  voids  forms  that  are  given  to  personnel  for training  or  instruction;  and  destroys  discarded  forms,  including  those  that  are  blank  or partially completed, and any reproduced copies of DD Form 214. 9.  Controlling Separation Program Designator (SPD) Codes. 9.1.  SPD  codes  identify  the  type  of  separation  for  officers  and  airmen  and  the  reason  for separation.    They  are  intended  solely  for  internal  use  by  DOD  and  are  not  intended  to stigmatize  individuals.    The  DOD  uses  them  to  compile  separation  statistics,  collect  and analyze data, and help determine whether personnel policies need to change. 9.2.  You must stamp all lists of SPD codes "For Official Use Only", including those used in MPF  elements,  according  to  AF  Supp/DOD  5400.7,  DOD  Freedom  of  Information  Act Program/Air  Force  Supplement.    Do  not  give  them  to  any  agency  or  person  outside  the DOD.    Use  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (Title  5,  U.S.C.,  section  552[b][2],  Public Information;  Agency  Rules,  Opinions,  Orders,  Records,  and  Proceedings)  as  authority  to keep the lists from the public.  See AF Supp/DoD Regulation 5400.7 for denying access. 9.3.  Separating  members  are  entitled  to  know  their  own  SPD  code.    The  code  appears  on copy 4 of the DD Form 214 that you give to the separating member. 9.4.  SPD codes do not show all the circumstances relating to a separation.  For this reason, and because codes may be outdated, you must not use them for any unauthorized purpose. Section D—Distributing Separation Documents 10.  Distributing DD Form 214. 10.1.  Because  the  DD  Form  214  is  the  document  that  separates  a  member  from  the  AF (Title10,  U.S.C.,  section  1168  and  paragraph  14),  or  ARC  members,  you  must  not  issue  it before the date of separation.  Treat DD Form 214 Worksheet the same as the DD Form 214.  Hand the original DD Form 214 and copy 4 to the separating member before he or she leaves the separation facility on either the date that separation from  active duty is effective, or the date when authorized travel time starts for a Reserve member reverting to inactive status. 10.1.1.  Have the member initial DD Form 214, item 30, for receipt of copy 4. 10.1.2.  Explain to members that copy 4: 10.1.2.1.  Is valuable as an official record. 10.1.2.2.  Shows  their  service  characterization,  their  eligibility  for  reenlistment,  and the reason for their separation. information 10.1.2.3.  Shows the  Department  of  Veterans'  Affairs  and  state unemployment  offices  need  in  order  to  determine  their  eligibility  for  benefits  based on  their  military  service.    Members  who  do  not  have  copy  4  must  wait  for  their eligibility to be verified. AFI36-3202  22 NOVEMBER 2005 9 10.1.2.4.  Is useful in asking for a review of the discharge action or seeking to reenter one of the Armed Forces. 10.1.3.  When  it  is  not  possible  to  deliver  the  original  DD  Form  214  personally  to  the separating member on the effective date of separation, mail it.  Mail the original when the member  is  on  leave,  at  home  awaiting  disability  separation,  in  civil  confinement,  or separated in absentia. 10.1.4.  For an incompetent member, deliver the original in person or by mail to the next of kin or guardian. 10.2.  Mail legible copies 3, 5, and 6 on the first workday after the separation date (see Table 5.).    NOTE:    The  MPF  or  responsible  office  must  mail  these  forms  punctually  and  are  not accumulated  over  a  period  of  time  before  they  are  mailed.    For  HQ  ARPC,  distribution  is done the day the DD Form 214 is issued. 10.3.  If  the  member  is  an  alien  discharged  in  absentia  or  a  naturalized  member  discharged under other than honorable conditions, refer to Section H. 10.4.  Upon  receipt  of  the  final  supplementary  court-martial  order  to  separate  a  member  on appellate review leave, DD Form 214 must be accomplished and mailed immediately, but no later than 15 days from date of receipt of the court-martial order.  Guidance for preparing the DD Form 214 is found in Table 4.  Provide the base SJA a copy of the DD Form 214 for their records.  NOTE:  Reference AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen, paragraphs 2.15.  and  3.7.    DD  Forms  214  will  not  be  issued  to  members  separating  under  these paragraphs  until  the  member  has  enlisted  in  the  USAFR,  or  when  the  oath  of  office  or enlistment in another branch of service has been executed. 11.  Distributing Other Separation Documents. 11.1.  See  AFI  33-328,  Administrative  Orders,    for  preparing  and  distributing  separation orders. 11.2.  Give or mail the discharge certificate to the member with the original DD Form 214.  Commanders may choose to present the certificate (paragraph 17.). 11.3.  See AFI 36-3203 for instructions on how to deliver retirement certificates. 12.  Undeliverable Separation Documents. 12.1.  If  the  MPF  cannot  deliver  separation  documents  to  the  member,  mail  them  to  HQ AFPC/ DPFFCMR (Attachment 1).  Explain in the transmittal memorandum why you did not deliver the documents as required by paragraphs 10. and 11. 12.2.  The  AF  Reserve  sends  undeliverable  discharge  certificates  to  HQ  ARPC/DSMP.  ARPC  files  them  in  the  master  military  personnel  record  before  shipping  the  record  to  the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC). 12.3.  The Air National Guard MPF sends undeliverable discharge/separation documents and or certificates to HQ ARPC/DPSF for inclusion in the master personnel records. 13.  Replacing  Separation  Certificates.  AFI  36-2608  tells  how  and  where  to  apply  for  a certificate in lieu of a lost or destroyed certificate of service, discharge, or retirement. 10 AFI36-3202  22 NOVEMBER 2005 Section E—Separation Procedures 14.  Effective  Time.  Separation  is  effective  at  2400  on  the  date  of  separation;  however,  for Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ)  purposes,  separation  is  effective  when  the  member receives the discharge certificate (either DD Form 214 or 256AF, or both) and final pay is made ready  (Title  10,  U.S.C,  section  1168).    If  the  MPF  finds  out  before  then  that  the  member,  for whatever  reason,  will  not  separate,  then  destroy  the  separation  documents.    Prepare  new documents when the member is separated. 15.  Where Members Are Separated. 15.1.  Usually, members serving in the Continental United States (CONUS) are separated at the  duty  base  or  the  nearest  base  that  can  process  the  separation.    If  the  duty  base  cannot process the separation, the members are placed on temporary duty (TDY) at the nearest base that  can  process  the  separation.    They  do  not  need  to  make  a  special  trip  to  pick  up  the separation  documents.    The  base  sends  these  papers  to  the  commander  for  delivery  on  the date that the separation is effective. 15.2.  Members  serving  overseas  have  two  options  where  they  may  separate  or  retire  other than  in  the  overseas  area  (paragraph  16).  Alaska,  Hawaii,  and  Guam  are  not  considered overseas  for  separation  purposes.  Assigned  Military  Personnel  Flights/Sections  separate members there. 15.2.1.  Under option 1, most members will complete separation or retirement processing at the overseas base and travel directly to final destination unless approval is granted for travel to a Separation Processing Base (SPB). 15.2.1.1.  Members  normally  agree  to  take  at  least  5  days  of  terminal  leave  or permissive  TDY  immediately  preceding  the  date  of  separation  (DOS)  or  retirement. This  ensures  the  member  completes  the  final  travel  to  the  US  prior  to  date  of separation  or  retirement.    If  a  member  desires  separation  in  the  overseas  area,  the MPF/S  will  ensure  that  the  member  has  completed  the  requirements  outlined  in paragraph 16. 15.2.1.2.  Overseas MPF/S accomplishes separation requirements  with  the exception of preparing the DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty. 15.2.1.3.  (DELETED) 15.2.2.  Under option 2, travel may be authorized to a SPB.  A SPB is an Air Force base in  the  CONUS  with  a  MPF/S  and  Financial  Services  Office  (FSO)  nearest  to  the member’s  projected  HOS.    If  support  facilities  do  not  exist  at  the  member’s  overseas location, a hardship exists that warrants travel to a separation  processing base (SPB), or travel  to  a  SPB  would  be  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Air  Force,  member  will  submit  a request, which includes full justification and concurrence of the member’s commander, to HQ  AFPC/DPSD  (for  members  who  are  being  medically  separated  or  retired),  HQ AFPC/DPSOS  (for  separating  members),  HQ  AFPC/DPSOR  (for  retiring  colonels  and below)  or  AF/DPG  (for  retiring  general  officers  and  general  officer  selectees)  as appropriate.    If  approved,  the  approving  authority  will  determine  the  appropriate  SPB closest to the member’s HOS and prepare travel orders directing movement. AFI36-3202  22 NOVEMBER 2005 11 15.2.2.1.  HQ  AFPC/DPSD  (for  members  who  are  being  medically  separated  or retired),  HQ  AFPC/DPSOS  (for  separating  members),  HQ  AFPC/DPSOR  (for retiring  colonels  and  below)  or  AF/DPG  (for  retiring  general  officers  and  general officer  selectees)  publishes  PCS  without  PCA  orders  on  separating  or  retiring members approved for travel to a SPB.  For all other members separating or retiring from  overseas, travel authorizations on the separation or retirement order. the  orders  publishing  authority includes  appropriate 15.2.2.2.  If member is authorized travel to SPB, the overseas MPF/S notifies the SPB MPF/S  by  email  or  message  at  least  5  workdays  before  member’s  departure,  or  as soon as flight information is known, providing arrival date, retirement effective date, PTDY, terminal leave, and any other pertinent data. 15.2.2.3.  The  MPF/S  ensures  member’s  projected  departure  from  the  overseas  area allows  member  to  report  to  SPB,  if  applicable,  no  earlier  than  3  workdays,  and  no later  than  1  workday  before  start  of  permissive  TDY,  terminal  leave,  or  date  of separation, as applicable. 15.2.2.4.  Overseas  bases  will  out-process  the  member  prior  to  departure.  Final  out-processing at the overseas base includes the preparation and authentication of the AF IMT 100, Request and Authorization for Separation. 15.2.2.5.  Overseas  MPF/Ss  give  the  stateside  processing  base  a  minimum  of  a  5-workday notice of the arrival of the separating member. 15.2.2.6.  Stateside processing base acknowledges receipt of the notification message and  notifies  the  losing  MPF/S  within  72  hours  after  scheduled  arrival  date  of  the failure of a member to report for separation or retirement. 15.3.  Members  will  not  be  allowed  to  separate  or  retire  overseas  without  meeting  host country residency requirements prior to their projected date of separation.  Overseas Military Personnel  Flight/Section  (MPF/Ss)  ensure  members  meet  country  requirements  or  ensure members  have  made  proper  arrangements  to  depart  the  overseas  location.    MPF/Ss  ensure members  not  taking  permissive  TDY  or  terminal  leave  in  conjunction  with  separation  or retirement depart the overseas area with sufficient travel time to reach the CONUS by their separation or retirement.  If a member’s travel is delayed due to a missed flight, etc, and the member  will  not  be  able  to  reach  the  CONUS  before  the  projected  date  of  separation,  the MPF/S  must  contact  the  orders  publishing  authority  as  soon  as  possible  for  processing instructions. 15.4.  The  overseas  MPF/S  ensures  member  has  contacted  HQ  AFPC/DPSOY  regarding preparation of DD Form 214.  HQ AFPC/DPSOY will provide member with completed DD Form  214  after  retirement  effective  date  to  avoid  legal  and  jurisdictional  problems,  along with  violation  of  the  Status  of  Forces  Agreement  the  US  government  has  with  the  host country. 16.  Requests for Separation in Overseas Areas. 16.1.  Members  serving  in  an  overseas  area  may  wish  to  separate  there.    To  separate overseas, the member requests separation in writing to unit commander; agrees to let the AF give  information  from  the  records  to  authorities  of  the  foreign  government  (see  paragraph 12 AFI36-3202  22 NOVEMBER 2005 19.4.);  and  shows  that  he  or  she  has  met  all  the  requirements  of  the  applicable  status-of-forces agreement and that authorities of the country concerned do not object. 16.1.1.  These procedures do not apply to members serving in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, or US  possessions  or  territories;  non-CONUS  residents  serving  in  their  home  state  or territory; and members who will continue to serve on active duty in another status. 16.2.  Overseas  MAJCOMs  set  local  rules  for  applying  for  separation.    MAJCOMs  may approve or disapprove applications except when the member is being separated for security reasons;  substantial  evidence  exists  that  separation  in  the  foreign  country  would  adversely affect  the  security  interests  of  the  US;  and  the  member  is  serving  a  sentence  in  a  foreign penal institution.  In these instances, send requests to HQ AFPC/DPPRS. 16.2.1.  MAJCOMs  may  delegate  this  authority  to  commanders  who  exercise  special court-martial  convening  authority.    Disapproval  authority  may  not  be  further  delegated.  The special court-martial  authority  may delegate approval  authority to the base director of personnel. 16.3.  Do not separate members in a foreign country until they have the documents they need to stay in the country legally.  Command supplements must tell which documents are needed in each country and they must refer to applicable laws. 16.4.  Do  not  allow  members  to  go  to  another  overseas  base  just  to  be  separated  in  a  more desirable place. 16.5.  Tell members who ask for separation in an overseas area that they will no longer have logistical support privileges.  Tell them how long they will be entitled to return transportation to CONUS at government expense. 17.  Departure Ceremony. 17.1.  The  MPF  personnel  relocation  office  notifies  the  immediate  commander  when preparing  to  separate  a  member.    If  it  is  appropriate,  the  commander  expresses  the  AF’ appreciation  for  the  member's  service.    The  commander  in  an  overseas  unit  of  assignment makes  this  gesture  for  members  who  will  separate  on  their  return  to  CONUS.    CONUS commanders may choose to present the discharge certificate to the separating member. 17.2.  Some  ways  to  recognize  service  or  express  appreciation  are  recommending  the member  for  an  award  (AFI  36-2803,  The  Air  Force  Awards  and  Decorations  Program); delivering a memorandum of appreciation from the immediate or higher commander or both; and giving a personal expression of farewell from the immediate commander. Section F—Post Separation Procedures 18.  Correcting DD Form 214. 18.1.  Once a DD Form 214 has been issued, do not reissue it unless you receive a request in writing and one of the following applies: 18.1.1.  You are directed to do so by an appellate authority, by Executive Order, or by the Office of the Secretary of the AF. 18.1.2.  Data in items 24, 25, 26, 28, or 29 needs correction. AFI36-3202  22 NOVEMBER 2005 13 18.1.3.  In order to correct or complete the original DD Form 214, you will need to issue more than one DD Form 215. 18.1.4.  Two DD Forms 215 have already been issued and further correction is needed. 18.1.5.  A second DD Form 215 changes the same item as the first DD Form 215 or an existing DD Form 215 contains incorrect information. 18.2.  Completing DD Form 215. 18.2.1.  Items  1  through  4  show  the  information  found  on  the  original  DD  Form  214, even if it is incorrect on the original DD Form 214. 18.2.2.  Separation date should match that  in  item  12b  on  the  DD  Form  214,  even  if  it  is  incorrect.    Make  corrections  as necessary in block 5 of the DD Form 215. 18.2.2.  Use “FROM” and “TO” to correct items 1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 12b, and 19 on the DD Form 214. 18.2.3.  Use “ADD” and “DELETE” to correct items 11, 13, 14, and 18. 18.2.4.  Do  not  correct  items  22,  24,  25,  26,  28,  and  29  using  a  DD  Form  215.  Corrections of these items require the DD Form 214 be reissued. EXCEPTION:  When item 29 is left blank and member has no lost time, correct with a DD Form 215. 18.2.5.  For all other items enter the correct information item 5 of DD Form 215. 18.3.  MPFs  and  other  separation  facilities  in  the  field  don't  correct  errors  found  after  the original DD Form 214 has been delivered.  The chief or noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC) of the personnel relocation office or higher level must sign requests for corrections. 18.3.1.  Send the requests to the appropriate agency, listed in Table 1.  If none of the rules in  Table  1.  applies,  send  the  request  for  correction  to  the  custodian  of  the  master personnel record (MPerR) (see AFI 36-2608).  Include source documents (AF IMT 418, Selective  Reenlistment  Program  Consideration,  separation  orders,  and  so  forth) supporting the request when appropriate. 18.3.2.  The separation facility notifies the responsible agency if an error is found on the DD Form 214 after it has been distributed. 18.4.  The distribution and Privacy Act  accountability of the DD  Form  215 are the same as for the DD Form 214 it corrects. 19.  Copies of the DD Form 214. 19.1.  Former members who want copies of DD Form 214 held in their MPerR must ask for them in writing.  For agencies authorized to issue copies, see Table 1.  NOTE:  MPFs may issue  copies  of  the  DD  Form  214,  copy  7,  which  is  retained  for  one  year,  if  the  member’s request  is  made  within  one  year  of  separation.    Effective  1  Jan  04,  MPFs  are  required  to maintain the DD Form 214 for 12 months from member’s date of separation. 19.2.  For  DD  Forms  214  issued  before  1  October  1979,  the  agency  sends  the  member  one completed copy and one copy with the following information deleted:  Specific authority for 14 AFI36-3202  22 NOVEMBER 2005 separation;  reason  for  separation;  reenlistment  eligibility  code;  and  SPD  or  separation designation number (SDN). 19.3.  For  DD  Forms  214  issued  after  1  October  1979,  the  agency  sends  the  member  one copy with the Special Additional Information Section and one copy without. 19.4.  Do  not  issue  a  copy  of  a  DD  Form  214  to  another  person  or  agency  unless  a  former member  provides  specific  written  authorization.    The  member's  authorization  must specifically  state  that  DD  Form  214,  copy  4,  or  DD  Form  214  with  the  Special  Additional Information Section may be released to the third party. 19.4.1.  If  the  member's  authorization  does  not  state  which  specific  DD  Form  214  copy may be released, issue a facsimile of DD Form 214, copy 1 (without Special Additional Information Section). 19.4.2.  If the member's authorization is for a DD Form 214 issued before 1 October 1979 and it does not specifically request that those items be provided, delete the items listed in paragraph 19.2. before releasing a copy. Section G—Status of Discharge 20.  Requesting the Reason for Discharge. 20.1.  A  former  member  may  take  an  original  DD  Form  214  to  the  nearest  MPF  to  get  an explanation of the reason for discharge from a given period of service. 20.2.  If  the  MPF  can  determine  the  reason  for  separation  from  the  DD  Form  214,  the personnel relocation element gives the member a memorandum of explanation from a person authorized  to  sign  DD  Forms  214  (for  the  memorandum  format,  see  Figure  1.);  returns  the original DD Form 214 to the member along with the original memorandum; sends a copy of the memorandum to the custodian of the MPerR (see Table 1.). 20.3.  If the MPF cannot find the reason for separation in DD Form 214, the MPF personnel relocation element refers the request to HQ AFPC/DPPRS by sending the original DD Form 214,  the  member's  mailing  address,  and  a  copy  of  the  separation  order,  if  one  is  available, and notifies the person of the referral. 21.  Reviewing a Discharge. 21.1.  The  AFDRB  was  set  up  under  Title  10,  U.S.C.,  1553,  Review  of  Discharge  or Dismissal and the AFBCMR under Title 10, U.S.C., 1552,  Correction of Military Records; Claims Incident Thereto. For information about each Board's authority to review discharges, see  Attachment  5.    Give  a  copy  of  this  attachment  to  airmen  who  are  separated  under circumstances (except retirement) that make them ineligible for reenlistment, and to officers discharged under adverse conditions. 21.2.  Attach  DD  Form  293,  Application  for  the  Review  of  Discharge  From  the  Armed Forces  of  the  United  States;  DD  Form  149,  Application  for  Correction  of  Military Record  Under  the  Provisions  of  Title  10,  U.S.C.,  Section  1552; and Standard Form 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records, to the fact sheet given to the member. AFI36-3202  22 NOVEMBER 2005 15  Section H—Naturalized Personnel and Aliens 22.  Naturalized Personnel Separated Under Other Than Honorable Conditions. 22.1.  Individuals  acquire  US  citizenship  through  service  in  the  US  Armed  Forces  during specified periods (see AFPAM 211-28, Naturalization and Citizenship, and Title 8, U.S.C., Aliens and Nationality Section 1440).  Such individuals may have their citizenship revoked if they are separated under other than honorable conditions. 22.2.  When  a  naturalized  member  is  separated  under  other  than  honorable  conditions,  the servicing  MPF  notifies  the  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Service  (INS)  (Attachment  1).  On the memorandum  reporting the separation, show member's full name;  date and place of separation;  future  home  address;  certificate  of  naturalization  number;  name  under  which naturalized,  if  different  from  name  at  separation;  date  and  place  of  birth;  date  and  place  of naturalization; and service characterization. 23.  Aliens Discharged for Alienage and Desertion. 23.1.  HQ AFPC/DPPRS may authorize discharge in absentia when an alien deserter goes to live  in  a  foreign  country.    In  such  cases  the  alien  typically  may  not  return  to  the  US  as  an immigrant alien.  If you are in charge of the separating facility in such a case: 23.1.1.  Send a copy of the original DD Form 214 to the Department of State Visa Office (Attachment  1).    Enter  the  place  of  birth  in  item  18.

A general term applied to all active military service, including full-time National Guard duty, without regard to duration or purpose. Active  Duty  for  Training—A tour of active duty that is used to train members of the Reserve Components. It provides trained units and qualified persons to fill the needs of the Armed Forces in time of war or national emergency and such other times as the national security requires.  The member must  return to nonactive status after the period of active duty for training (ADT).  ADT includes  annual  training,  special  tour  of  ADT,  school  tours,  and  the  initial  duty  for  training performed by nonprior service enlistees. Active  Duty  Guard  and  Reserve—All  personnel  of  the  National  Guard  and  Reserve  Forces serving on extended active duty (under Title 10, U.S.C., or full-time National Guard duty under Title 32, U.S.C.). Airman—An enlisted person in the US Air Force in any component. Characterization  of  Service—A  determination  of  a  member's  military  behavior  and performance of duty during a specific period of service.  Choices are honorable; under honorable conditions  (general);  under  other  than  honorable  conditions;  bad  conduct;  dishonorable;  and uncharacterized. Continuous  Active  Military  Service  Date—Date  from  which  a  member  has  been  in  active military service without a break. Discharge—Severance  from  all  military  status.    EXCEPTION:    For  a  member  of  the  Air National Guard of the United States (ANGUS), discharge may be from the ANGUS only, with concurrent  transfer  to  the  US  Air  Force  Reserve  for  the  remainder  of  a  military  service obligation. It does not include dismissal as a result of trial by general court-martial or "dropped from the rolls" of the Air Force under Title 10, U.S.C., 1161(b) or 1163(b). AFI36-3202  22 NOVEMBER 2005 45 Extended  Active  Duty—A  tour  of  active  military  service  (usually  for  more  than  90  days) performed by a member of the Air Reserve components.  Strength accountability for persons on EAD changes from the Air Reserve components to the active force.  Strength accountability does not change for statutory tour officers on EAD in accordance with Title 10, U.S.C., 175, 678, 265, 8496, 8021, 8019, and 8038. Honorable—The  honorable  characterization  is  appropriate  when  the  quality  of  the  airman's service generally has met Air Force standards of acceptable conduct and performance of duty.  It may  also  be  appropriate  when  a  member's  service  is  otherwise  so  meritorious  that  any  other characterization would be inappropriate.   A member’s service must be honorable to be eligible for retirement. Initial Active Duty for Training—The first period of active duty for training prescribed by law or regulation for nonprior service enlistees. It trains members in a military specialty. Member—An officer, warrant officer, Air Force Academy cadet, or airman. Noncontinental  United  States  (Non—CONUS)  Resident—A  person  whose  official  home  of record,  as  defined  by  the  Joint  Travel  Regulations,  is  Alaska,  Hawaii,  Guam,  Puerto  Rico,  US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, or the Canal Zone (since 1 October 1979). Officer—A commissioned or warrant officer of the Armed Forces. Release—Separation  from  a  void  enlistment  or  induction  that  does  not  involve  a  regular discharge.  A DD Form 214 is issued but not a discharge certificate. Release From Active Duty—End of active duty status.  This term applies to members of the Regular Air Force who are transferred to a Reserve component to complete their military service obligations and to members of Reserve components who revert to inactive status in their Reserve organizations. Reserve Components—The Reserve components of the Air Force are the Air National Guard of the US and the US Air Force Reserve. The three types of Air Reserve Forces are Ready Reserve, Standby Reserve, and Retired Reserve. RD—A  Reserve  Section  Code  which  represents  members  assigned  to  the  Inactive  Ready Reserve without a military service obligation (MSO). Separation—A  general  term  that  includes  discharge,  release  from  active  duty,  release  from custody and control of the Armed Forces, or transfer to a Reserve component. Temporary  Disability  Retired  List—A  list  of  physically  unfit  members  whose  disability  has not stabilized to the point where its severity, percent of disability, or ultimate disposition can be accurately assessed. Under Honorable Conditions (General)—If an airman's service has been honest and faithful, it is  appropriate  to  characterize  as  under  honorable  conditions  (general).    Characterization  of service  as  general  is  warranted  when  significant  negative  aspects  of  the  airman's  conduct  or performance of duty outweigh positive aspects of the airman's military record. Under  Other  Than  Honorable  Conditions—An  airman's  service  may  be  characterized  as under other than honorable conditions only if the member is given an opportunity for a hearing by  an  administrative  discharge  board  or  requests  discharge  in  lieu  of  trial  by  court-martial.  Characterization  of  service  as  under  other  than  honorable  conditions  may  be  appropriate  when 46 AFI36-3202  22 NOVEMBER 2005 the reason for separation is based on a pattern of behavior or one or more acts or omissions that constitute a significant departure from the conduct expected of airmen.

When  authorized  by  the  President  of  the  United  States  or  the  Congress,  the  active  force may  be  expanded  by    mobilizing  the  Reserve  Forces  to  satisfy  an  emergency  requirement.  Usually  under  these  circumstances,  it  is  necessary  to  minimize  the  number  of  Air  Force personnel  leaving  active  duty.  The  Government  suspends  certain  officer  and  enlisted  voluntary and involuntary discharges, releases, and retirements. A2.2.  The  President  may  suspend  any  provisions  of  law  relating  to  promotion,  retirement,  or separation applicable to any member of the Armed Forces whom the President determines to be essential to the national security of the United States.  The President may do so during any period when members of a Reserve component are serving under an order to active duty authorized by sections 12301, 12302 and 12303 of the U.S.C., Title 10.  48  AFI36-3202  22 NOVEMBER 2005 Attachment 3  CONTINUATION SHEET FOR DD FORM 214           (date of separation) 1.

What  Is  a  Discharge  Review?  In  a  Discharge  Review,  your  discharge  is  examined  to decide whether the Service discharged you correctly and whether your service was characterized fairly.    Discharge  policies  and  procedures  change  from  time  to  time.    The  Boards  that  review discharges  must  consider  these  changes  in  reviewing  your  discharge.    You  may  benefit  from these changes if you apply. A5.2.  Who  Is  Eligible  To  Apply  for  a  Discharge  Review?  Former  service  members  may apply for a discharge review or correction of records.  If the former service member has died or is not mentally competent, the surviving spouse, next of kin, or legal representative may sign the application but legal proof must accompany the application. A5.3.  How To Apply for a Discharge Review. A5.3.1.  STEP  1:    You  can  apply  and  present  your  case  on  your  own  but  several  national service organizations are available to help you.  These organizations provide free counsel or a  representative  to  assist  you  in  your  discharge  review.    The  local  chapters  of  these organizations  (e.g.,  American  Legion,  Disabled  American  Veterans,  Veterans'  of  Foreign Wars, Jewish War Veterans) can be found in the telephone directory. A5.3.2.  STEP 2:  You do not have to get a copy of your military records but they may help you to prepare your discharge appeal, to discuss your case with a counsel or representative, and to understand the official reason for your discharge.  You can get a copy of your records at  no  charge.    Use  a  SF  180,  Request  Pertaining  to  Military  Records,  to  request  a  copy  of your records.   In section 2, number 1, of SF 180, write "complete service and records."   In section  2,  number  4,  write  "discharge  review."    Medical  records  are  on  file  with  the Department of Veterans Affairs. A5.3.3.  STEP  3:    Submit  the  right  application  form.    There  are  two  Air  Force  Boards  that consider  requests  to  change  the  characterization  and  reason  for  discharges,  each  of  which requires  a  different  application  form.    You  should  apply  first  to  the  Air  Force  Discharge Review Board (AFDRB) using DD Form 293.  If the AFDRB's decision is unfavorable, you may apply to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) using DD Form  149,  Application  for  Correction  of  Military  Record  Under  the  Provisions  of  Title  10, U.S.C., Section 1552. A5.3.4.  STEP 3.1.  If fewer than 15 years have elapsed since your discharge and you want to ask for a changed separation characterization, use a DD Form 293 to apply to the Air Force Discharge  Review  Board  (AFDRB),  if  one  of  the  following  applies:    your  service  was characterized  as  under  honorable  conditions  (general),  your  service  was  characterized  as UOTHC, you received a bad conduct discharge as the result of trial by special court-martial, or you want to change the reason and authority for discharge. A5.3.5.  STEP  3.2.    Use  DD  Form  149  to  apply  to  the  Air  Force  Board  for  Correction  of Military Records  (AFBCMR) if one of the  following applies:     you received an entry level separation;  want  to  be  reinstated;  have  been  previously  denied  by  the  Discharge  Review Board,  were  tried  by  a  general  court-martial  and  sentenced  to  dismissal  or  bad  conduct  or dishonorable discharge, feel your reenlistment code is incorrect or unjust or, fifteen years or AFI36-3202  22 NOVEMBER 2005 59 more have elapsed since  you were discharged.   NOTE:    AFBCMR  applications  ordinarily must be submitted within three years of discovering errors or injustices in military records. STEP 4:  Once you have filled out as much of the form as you can, following the instructions on the back, mail it to the address shown for your branch of service. A5.4.  Frequently Asked Questions. A5.4.1.  Can I Review Previous Decisions of the Review Boards?  Yes.  There is an index of decisions  of  the  Review  Boards  that  might  help  you  appeal  your  discharge.    The  index identifies cases that might be similar to yours and explains the Board’s rationale.  Your state Veterans' Affairs Office or one of the service organizations listed on the DD Form 293 can tell you where to find the index.  If you feel that the key to the index or prior cases would be helpful in your appeal, you can get copies by writing to:      DA Military Review Boards Agency     ATTN:  Reading Room     Crystal Mall 4, Second Floor     1941 Jefferson Davis Highway     Arlington, VA 22205 Or, go on-line at:  www.boards.law.af.mil A5.4.2.  How Can I Get a Copy of the Instruction Under Which I Was Discharged? To get  a copy of the pertinent  part of  the instruction under which  you were discharged, as well as the current version of the instruction, write a memorandum indicating both your date of  separation  and  the  reason  and  (or)  authority  as  shown  on  your  official  separation document.    You  can  also  obtain  a  copy  of  the  instruction  that  guides  the  Review  Boards procedures.  Send the request to:  NTIS, 5825 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. A5.4.3.  Do I Have To Go to Washington for the Discharge Review?  No. The Discharge Review Board conducts reviews throughout the country.  The Correction Board does not travel and only conducts  reviews  in  Washington.    However,  the  Board  rarely  requires  a  veteran  to  travel  to Washington DC for a hearing. A5.4.4.  Do I Have To Appear Before a Discharge Review Board in Person? No,  but  it  may  help  if  you  do.
