Administrative Orders. Administrative orders are written directives, published by a commander orother competent authority, which direct actions or announce decisions. Order-publishing officials mustfollow this instruction and the appropriate functional directives governing the order. Four types of admin-istrative orders exist: special, reserve, aeronautical, and movement. 1.1.1.  Special Orders (SO). 1.1.1.1.  Direct individuals onto extended active duty or change the status of military personnel onactive duty (e.g., they appoint, assign, promote, demote, retire, separate, direct temporary duty[TDY], and authorize travel of dependents). 1.1.1.2.  Announce assumption and appointment of command, and the closing and opening of aheadquarters. 1.1.1.3.  Designate, re-designate, activate, inactivate, assign, and reassign all types of UnitedStates Air Force (USAF)-controlled units and installations. This includes any ANG units andinstallations. 1.1.1.4.  Attach one unit to another. 1.1.1.5.  Authorize travel of Department of Defense (DoD) civilians for permanent change of sta-tion (PCS) movements, TDY, and assignment (of military or civilian personnel) to official boardsor committees; or to other specific duties. 1.1.1.6.  Authorize travel on military aircraft for non-DoD civilians. 1.1.1.7.  Invite civilians who are not federal employees to perform official travel for the Air Force. 1.1.1.8.  Award individual and unit decorations. 1.1.2.  Reserve Orders (RO). These orders apply to Air Force Reserve members not on extendedactive duty (e.g., they appoint; assign; promote; demote; retire; discharge; order to annual, special,and school tours of active duty; or change the personnel data or status of Air Force Reserve membersnot on extended active duty). 1.1.3.  Aeronautical Orders (AO). 1.1.3.1.  Start or end aviation career service. 1.1.3.2.  Disqualify or re-qualify members for aviation service. 1.1.3.3.  Award advanced aeronautical ratings. 1.1.3.4.  Award aeronautical badges. 1.1.3.5.  Place members on parachute jump status. 1.1.4.  Movement Orders (MO). These orders move units as directed by HQ USAF or overseas com-mands. 1.1.5.  Miscellaneous. When reporting the results of trials and actions of the convening or higherauthority, either Special Court-Martial Orders or General Court-Martial Orders are issued in accor-AFI33-328   16 JANUARY 20075dance with AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice. The Court-Martial Order is also used inappellate review. This type of order is different from the Special Order used to convene a Court-Mar-tial. The Court-Martial Order is not a special order. 1.2.  Authority to Publish Orders. Commanders down to and including squadron level may publishorders. Commanders below squadron level, such as detachments or flights, may publish TDY orders witha specific authorization from a higher level commander (see AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders). Com-manders may publish orders that are not within their jurisdiction only if the proper commander approvesor if HQ USAF directs publication. Hospitals and aero-medical staging units may publish orders onpatients who are members of any Air Force activity, but they will send copies to the patient's parent orga-nization. The commander or OPR for the specific order instruction may delegate orders publishingauthority, but they will not delegate orders approval authority unless authorized by AFI 51-604, Appoint-ment to and Assumption of Command. 1.3.  Restriction on Publication. Do not publish orders for routine actions unless higher headquartersdirectives, legal, or financial requirements make it necessary. Instead, use an appointment memorandumor other prescribed method. For example, do not publish orders to authorize ordinary leave; to assignadditional duties such as building custodians, TOP SECRET control officers, security officers, record cus-todians, and fire marshals; to appoint a board or committee when membership is established by positiontitle in published directives; or to implement personnel actions except group actions announced in "P"series orders. 6AFI33-328   16 JANUARY 2007Chapter 2  PREPARING ORDERS 2.1.

Forms for Orders. Forms standardize and, therefore, simplify the publishing of administrativeorders. When you cannot use a form, you may compose an order. However, be sure to include all requiredinformation. Computer-generated orders may vary in format from form or composed orders as long as10AFI33-328   16 JANUARY 2007they include all required data. The ANG will use computer-generated orders when possible. Prescribedforms for orders generation are not applicable to the ANG. 2.3.  Composed Orders.  2.3.1.  Paper Size, Margins, and Numbering. See Figure 2.1. for a sample composed order. Use8.5-by-11-inch paper and leave a 1-inch margin around each page on all composed orders except forcomputer-generated ones. Number the second page 0.5 inch from the page bottom at the left margin.Type the order number in the lower right corner of the first page. 2.3.2.  Heading. Include the following elements in the heading: the title “DEPARTMENT OF THEAIR FORCE”; the complete unit designation; the name of the major command (MAJCOM) of assign-ment, abbreviated in parentheses; the complete mailing address; the type and number of order; and thedate the order is published. Do not postdate or antedate the orders. 2.3.3.  Body. Write clearly and concisely. Do not use code words or unauthorized abbreviations. Youmay use abbreviations in the dictionary and authorized nicknames if such use creates no confusion.Write a separate paragraph for each action directed. List all persons or activities affected by the sameaction in the same paragraph. Number paragraphs when using more than one. 2.3.4.  Close. Include the following elements in the closing: the orders-approving official's signatureblock, the authority for publishing the orders, when required, distribution, and the authority line whennot using the commander's name. The OPR for the specific order instruction decides whether toinclude any additional items. 2.3.4.1.  Unless a directive specifically requires it, you need not cite the authority for publishing anorder. You must, however, cite an authority in all orders that involve travel at government expense. AFI33-328   16 JANUARY 2007Figure 2.1.  Sample Composed Order. 1112AFI33-328   16 JANUARY 20072.3.4.2.  Refer to Table 2.3. for authorized authority lines. 2.3.4.3.  No seal or signature is needed on computer-generated orders; place the word “OFFI-CIAL” above the signature element instead. Table 2.3.  Authorized Authority Lines. A For: R ULE 1  Department of the Air Force  BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR Use This Authority Line: B 2  Missions and Commissions 3  Attaches 4  Air Force Academy 5  Air Force Components of Unified and Specified Commands 6  All Other Units FORCE FOR THE CHIEF FOR THE AIR ATTACHE FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE COMMANDER FOR THE COMMANDERorFOR THE COMMANDANT 2.3.5.  Multiple-Page Orders and Continuation Lines. Strive to keep all orders to two pages--onesheet, front and back. If orders are longer than two pages on standard-size paper, print on legal-sizepaper when you can reduce and reproduce the orders on standard-size paper. 2.3.5.1.  Write the order number, publisher, and date at the top of each odd-numbered page (e.g.,SO A-109, HQ ACC, Langley AFB VA, 1 September 1998, if you must use more than one sheet,);this is optional for even-numbered pages. 2.3.5.2.  Include the heading, order number, date, and authority line on both sides of the page forcomputer-generated, multiple-name orders. 2.3.5.3.  Number multiple-page orders at the bottom of each page to show how many pages are inthe order (e.g., “Page 1 of 3 Pages”). 2.4.  Identifying Personnel.  2.4.1.  Single Person. Type the person's grade and name in CAPITAL letters. The first time you use aname, state grade or title; first name, middle initial, last name (or last name, first name, middle initial);and social security number (SSN). If the person is on a retired list, write the word "Retired" after thegrade. Use only the grade or title and last name if you use the same name more than once in the sameparagraph. 2.4.2.  Groups. When many individuals are on an order, make a machine roster according to AFCSM36-699, Volume 1, and photocopy it on the order. Prepare an extract copy (see paragraph 3.9.) accord-AFI33-328   16 JANUARY 200713ing to The Privacy Act of 1974 by omitting SSNs of other members on copies of group orders that aregiven to individual members. 2.4.3.

Forexample, write: "CAPT MARK HESS 000-00-0000, DA (INF)" or "SQ LEADER JAMES WFEARS, 5167, Royal Air Force." 2.4.5.  Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) Agents. The AFOSI Special Agent’s (SA)rank and grade should be omitted from all TDY and PCS orders. All SAs should have a designatedsingle point of contact at Special Orders processing, Permanent Change of Station (PCS) and TrafficManagement Office (TMO). 2.4.6.  Senior Executive Service (SES), Scientific, or Professional Personnel. Include the traveler'sposition title and precedence priority (distinguished visitor [DV]) code after the name on all forms andcomposed travel orders. For example, write: "SES-3 Deputy Director, Materiel Management(OC-ALC) (DV-6)." 2.5.  Numbering and Dating Administrative Orders. Number and date each order. 2.5.1.  Number orders by using a letter prefix to identify the series of orders, starting with number 1for each fiscal or calendar year (determined by the OPR for the specific order instruction). For exam-ple, A-1, A-2, G-1, G-2. When you want to break out a series by specific type of action or preparingoffice, add a second letter prefix. 2.5.2.  Cite the number of the last order published the previous year above the heading of the firstorder of a year. If no orders were published in a series during the preceding year (or years), write: "Noorders were published in this series in (year or years)." 2.5.3.  Write above the heading of the consolidated order: "SO (series and number), (organization),(date), was last SO published in (identify discontinued series). Effective this date, the (discontinuedseries) is consolidated in (new series)" when discontinuing a series of orders and consolidating it withanother series. 2.5.4.  Continue to number in order when a unit issuing an order inactivates and another unit activatesimmediately to perform the same mission. Cite the authority for the change above the heading of thefirst order published thereafter. 2.5.5.  Begin a new series when a unit is transferred without personnel and equipment to another baseor command. 2.5.6.  OPRs for specific order instructions may provide additional order numbering guidance asdeemed appropriate. 14AFI33-328   16 JANUARY 2007Chapter 3  VERBAL ORDERS AND CHANGES TO ORDERS 3.1.  Verbal Orders of the Commander. Do not issue verbal orders if possible. Commanders may issueverbal orders that involve obligating funds, flying status, or aeronautical ratings of individuals only whentime prevents the publication of written orders in advance of travel. 3.1.1.  Confirm verbal orders (in writing) as soon as possible. In the written order, identify who issuedthe verbal order and the date the verbal order was given. EXAMPLE: The verbal orders of the Cmdr,HQ ACC, Langley AFB VA, 1 Oct 98, directing CAPT JAY A. SMITH, 123-45-6789, HQ ACC/IGOF,this stn, to proceed on 1 Oct 98 from Langley AFB VA to Luke AFB AZ on TDY for approximately 3days to obtain depositions in connection with an aircraft accident investigation and to return to Lan-gley AFB VA, are confirmed; circumstances prevented written orders in advance. (MSN) (SITE VISIT)TDY. Submit a travel voucher within 5 workdays after receipt of orders. (Accounting Classification.)Authority: AFI 36-2110 and HQ USAF/IGD Ltr, 30 Sep 98, Aircraft Accident Investigation. 3.1.2.  State why written orders were not issued earlier if funds were spent or flying status or aeronau-tical ratings were affected. For example, you might write "The verbal orders of the commander on(date) are confirmed; circumstances prevented written orders in advance." 3.1.3.  Do not include variations in itinerary when publishing orders after travel is completed. 3.1.4.  The name of the unit that issued the verbal order must be included in the order when an orderis published by an organization that publishes orders for several units. 3.1.5.  P-series orders may be published after their effective date without a confirmation statement oran explanation. Command directors of personnel must make sure publication occurs promptly. 3.2.  Amendments, Rescissions, and Revocations. Use AF Form 973, Request and Authorization forChange of Administrative Orders, to amend, rescind, or revoke an order. See Attachment 2 for instruc-tions on completing AF Form 973. Use a composed order if the form is not practical. Publish amend-ments, rescissions, and revocations in the same series as the original order. Do not use blanket statementssuch as "Previous orders are rescinded" or "This order supersedes all previously published orders." Do notuse AF Form 973 for orders convening courts-martial, appointing investigating officers for boards orcommittees, or for aeronautical orders. 3.3.  Who May Change an Order. Normally only the organization that published the original order mayamend, rescind, or revoke it. Functional OPRs for specific order instructions may authorize other organi-zations or activities to change specific orders. Provide a copy of any changes to the organization that pub-lished the original order. 3.4.  When to Amend an Order. Publish an amendment to add, delete, or change pertinent data to readas originally intended. Functional OPRs for specific order instructions will provide specific instructionsand guidance on when their orders will be amended, and when an amendment is inappropriate. 3.5.  When to Rescind an Order. Rescind an order when it is no longer needed; for example, if an indi-vidual has blanket or repeated travel orders but now has a change in duty assignment. AFI33-328   16 JANUARY 2007153.6.  When to Revoke an Order. Revoke an order before it goes into effect or before any funds areexpended. 3.7.  Additional Guidance.  3.7.1.  Justify retroactive amendments to orders that increase or decrease the amount of money due thetraveler or the government. Include justification or an explanation statement in the remarks section ofthe amendment. The justification or explanation statement used in the remarks section of the amend-ment must clearly show that the original order was unclear, incomplete, or lacked necessary informa-tion. 3.7.2.  The new order may announce the revocation or rescission if an organization revokes or rescindsan order and immediately replaces it with another. Add the statement: "This order revokes or rescinds(order number and date)" in the remarks section of form orders. Make this statement the last paragraphin composed orders. 3.7.3.  When an order is revoked, it no longer exists as an official document. A rescinded order is stillan official document, although it can no longer be used. Do not revoke a revocation or rescission; pub-lish a new order. 3.8.  Corrected Copies. Publish a corrected copy of an order only to correct an error in the heading orclose of the original composed order, or the approving official's part of a form order. (To correct a fundcitation or an error in the body of the order, publish an amendment.) Enter "Corrected Copy-Destroy AllOthers" and the incorrect number and date at the top of the corrected copy. Use the same heading andclose as on the original composed or form order, correcting only those portions that need it. Double under-score the corrected portion when possible; and make sure the distribution matches the original order. 3.9.  Copies. You may reproduce any order or portion of it, as a copy or an extract copy. Include the sameheading and close as the original composed or form order, and the statement "COPY" or "EXTRACTCOPY." Write only the required information for an extract copy. For example, if a paragraph includes sev-eral individuals, list only the person who needs the copy on the extract copy. Use asterisks to indicateomitted material. Any orders issuing or approving official authorized to publish orders may sign copies orextract copies. 3.10.  Printed Information on Reverse of Orders. You may print information on the reverse of specialorders if the OPR for the specific order instruction imposes no specific limitations. Limit information onthe reverse of orders to that which does not reasonably fit on the front. Additional remarks are the mostcommon use of the reverse side of orders. 16AFI33-328   16 JANUARY 2007Chapter 4  REPRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, MAINTENANCE, AND DISPOSITION 4.1.  Reproduction. Keep orders reproduction to a minimum. Use both sides when duplicating. Revoca-tion or rescission orders typically do not require the same number of copies as the original order. 4.2.  Distribution. Indicate distribution under the word distribution by entering a list of all individualsand organizations, a distribution code, or both. The orders-publishing organization must maintain the listof codes and standard distributions if it uses distribution codes. 4.2.1.  Normally, distribute orders no later than the first workday after they are published. FunctionalOPRs for a specific type of order may provide additional guidance. 4.2.2.  Distribute orders to each individual and organization named in the order, except organizationswhere individuals will perform short periods of TDY and all activities listed in standard distributionrequirement set by publishing authority or higher headquarters. OPRs for orders may establish spe-cific order distribution requirements. 4.2.3.  Distribute classified orders only to persons who need them and who have proper clearance. 4.3.  Maintenance. The orders publishing activity maintains all record sets of their orders according toAFI 33-364, Records Disposition-Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFRIMS RDS. It may delegatethis authority to subordinate units or activities that publish orders in their name. The orders-publishingactivity is responsible for making sure that all orders are properly prepared, reproduced, distributed, andmaintained. 4.3.1.  File the published copy of each order in numerical sequence by type and series. File back-ground material as the orders-approving official directs. Annotate the background material in thelower right corner to show the paragraph and order number to which it pertains. Background materialincludes coordination, approvals, letters, messages, justification files for special authorizations, andtheater clearances. Form orders typically have no background material because they are both a requestand an order. 4.3.2.  Post each amendment, revocation, or rescission to the original order. After posting the amend-ment, revocation, or rescission to the original order, mark the amendment, revocation, or rescissionwith the word "Posted" along with the date of the posting and the initials of the person who postedinformation on the original order. 4.4.  Disposition and Retrieval. Each orders-publishing activity accumulating record sets of orders isresponsible for the proper and timely retirement of the records sets. Once inactive records are transferredto the base records staging area, the base records manager (RM) will assist in retrieval of records sets oforders upon request and will transfer eligible records to the designated federal records center. If separateseries of orders are published by subordinate units or offices in the name of the parent unit, retire themwith the parent unit's orders. 4.4.1.  Transfer inactive records sets to the base records staging area; attach a listing of all orders to theStandard Form (SF) 135, Records Transmittal and Receipt, and place a copy of the listing in a folderat the very front of the orders. This listing can be a copy of any orders log created and maintained dur-AFI33-328   16 JANUARY 200717ing orders production. Account for all numbers in each orders series, used or unused, on the list.

In most cases the signature (orofficial stamp) of the orders approving official or designated representative is enough to validate an order.A separate authentication is unnecessary. However, the functional OPRs may require additionalauthentication if they think it is necessary. 20AFI33-328   16 JANUARY 2007Effective Date—The date orders go into effect. This is usually the date of the order, unless the orderspecifies a different effective date or confirms previous verbal orders.

Functional Order Office of Primary Responsibility—Organization that guides and manages specificorders programs, although it may not actually prepare the specific order. Orders-Issuing or Approving Official—The competent authority who determines the need for an order,requests its publication, justifies special authorizations, and approves claims for reimbursing items notauthorized in the order or that requires administrative approval. This official normally signs manuallyprepared orders but may also use a stamp. He or she does not need to sign computer-generated orders.However, if neither a signature nor stamp is used, there must be adequate controls to ensure properapproval. AFI33-328   16 JANUARY 200721Attachment 2  REQUEST AND AUTHORIZATION FOR CHANGE OF ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS PREPARING AIR FORCE FORM 973, A2.1.
