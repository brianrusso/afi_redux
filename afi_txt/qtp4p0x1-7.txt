Compile Drug Utilization Review (DUR), Drug Utilization Evaluation (DUE) reports           QTP 4P0X1-7 15 September 2014    PHARMACY TECHNICIAN           OPR:  CMSgt Alvin M. Holland   TABLE OF CONTENTS   OBJECTIVE      PAGES Compile DUR, DUE reports                             3 - 7       MODULE  1.                                        INTRODUCTION   1.  This Qualification Training Package (QTP) was developed to enhance and standardize on-the-job  training  for  4P0X1  personnel.    As  a  trainer,  the  QTPs  provide  teachable  elements  of  task breakdowns.  The teachable elements will assist in guiding the trainee towards independent task performance, proficiency, and serve as an evaluation tool for trainers/certifiers.  2.    Review  the  volume(s)  of  the  Career  Development  Course  (s)  (CDC)  and  identify  which module(s) of the QTP is needed for the trainee’s job position or upgrade skill-level training.  The QTP training for each module should be accomplished in the order which most closely mirrors the area in which the trainee is working.  Items in column 2 of the Pharmacy Job Qualification Standard (JQS)/Specialty Training Standard (STS) marked with a 5 or 7 are core tasks for the 4P career field.  Additional proficiency training may be required for these tasks at the supervisor’s discretion.   3.  Ensure the trainee reviews the training references in each module prior to attempting any task or QTP evaluation.  Review the performance checklist and training objective with the trainee.  If the trainee has questions about the objective, clarify the desired outcome/results of performance, demonstration or completion of the task.  Remember the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task independently.    4.  When the trainee has received sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on the objective, follow the evaluation instructions.  The performance checklist must be used as you evaluate each task  objective.    When  the  trainee  successfully  demonstrates  and  accomplishes  the  objective, document  the  task  completion  appropriately  in  the  member’s  Air  Force  Training  Record (AFTR).  5.    The  QTP  task  completion  is  to  be  annotated  in  the  trainee’s  electronic  training  record.  NOTE:  The individual checklists and final evaluations are not filed in each member’s user files.  6.  If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas needing further instruction.  Conduct feedback for each module with the trainee, and document appropriately in the member’s Air Force Training Record.  As the trainer, once you are satisfied the trainee is ready to perform the task, he/she will be re-evaluated until the objective is met.  7.  If a task being trained requires third party certification by a task certifier/certifying official, the trainer ensures trainee is qualified to perform the task independently.  The trainee will then be evaluated by certifier/certifying official.  Tasks requiring certification are identified in column 2 of JQS with a number sign (#).  The certifier/certifying official will ensure documentation in column 3E of the JQS. The certifier will ensure that a trainer’s signature is documented prior to signing off on the task in AFTR.  8.    Tasks  associated  with  a  QTP  are  identified  in  column  4D  of  the  STS.    The  QTPs  are  a necessary tool for standardizing task qualifications for upgrade training or job position training.  Such  standardization  benefits  the  JQS  training  concept  throughout  a  member’s  career.    These documents may also be used in assessing/certifying pharmacy technicians upon arrival at a new duty station.  9.  Feedback is a vital and important part of improving our educational process for pharmacy technicians.  Your first hand expertise is valued and feedback highly encouraged ensuring we have the most up-to-date information and training possible.   Please direct all inquiries to:  your immediate supervisor.                                        SUBJECT AREA:  Pharmacy Administration  TASK NAME(S):  Compile and record Drug Utilization Review and Drug Utilization Evaluation Reports  CFETP/STS REFERENCE(S):  9.5  EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:  Composite Health Care System (CHCS)  TRAINING REFERENCE(S):  4P051A CDC, Volume and CHCS Manual  REMARKS/NOTES:  None  OBJECTIVE:  1.
