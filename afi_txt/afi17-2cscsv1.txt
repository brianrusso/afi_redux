Additional  training  requirements  to  the  CSCS  weapon  system include Requalification Training (RT), Upgrade Training, and Instructor Training. to  progress  an training is  designed 1.5.1.  Ready Cybercrew Program (RCP). RCP is the CT program designed to focus training on  capabilities  needed  to  accomplish  a  unit’s  core  tasked  missions  and  fulfill  the  DOC statement mission requirements. Upon completion of IQT and MQT, crewmembers will have received  training  in  all  the  basic  mission-sets  of  the  unit.  After  MQT  completion, crewmembers will then be assigned to a MR or BMC manning position within the unit and maintain  the  appropriate  level  of  proficiency  and  currency  per  the  RCP  tasking memorandum. 1.5.2.  Initial Qualification Training (IQT). Training needed to qualify for basic crewmember duties  in  an  assigned  crew  position  for  a  specific  weapon  system,  without  regard  for  the unit’s operational mission. See Chapter 2. 8 AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 1.5.3.  Mission  Qualification  Training  (MQT).  The  purpose  of  MQT  is  to  qualify crewmembers in assigned crew positions to perform the command or unit mission IAW the unit’s DOC statement. See Chapter 3. 1.5.4.  Continuation  Training  (CT).  The  CT  program  provides  crewmembers  with  the volume,  frequency,  and  mix  of  training  necessary  to  maintain  proficiency  in  the  assigned certification/qualification level. 1.5.5.  Requalification  Training  (RT).  RT  is  designed  to  provide  the  training  necessary  to requalify  a  crewmember  with  an  expired  qualification  evaluation  or  loss  of  currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items specified in Chapter 4). 1.5.6.  Mission  Ready  (MR).  A  crewmember  who  satisfactorily  completed  IQT  and  MQT, and maintains qualification and proficiency in the unit mission. 1.5.6.1.  All  CPI-1/-2/-A/-Z designated positions will maintain certification/qualification status.  The OG/CC may require other CPI-6/B positions not assigned to the squadron to be certified/qualified. See Attachment 4 for CPI explanation and definitions. (T-3) 1.5.6.2.  MR crewmembers will maintain currencies that affect MR status, accomplish all core designated training (missions and events), and all mission related training.  Failure to  complete  required  MR  training  or  maintain  currencies  will  result  in  regression  to BMC.  Failure  of  an  MR  crewmember  to  maintain  BMC  currencies  will  result  in regression to non-MR (NMR) status. MR crewmembers, regressed to BMC, may perform missions and events in which they are certified at the discretion of the SQ/CC. (T-3) 1.5.7.  Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A crewmember that satisfactorily completed IQT and MQT, is qualified in some aspect of the unit mission, but does not maintain MR status. The crewmember  must  be  able  to  attain  full  MR  status  as  specified  in  MAJCOM-provided guidance. 1.5.7.1.  Assign  BMC-coded  positions  to  crewmembers  with  the  primary  job  of performing  wing  supervision  or  staff  functions  that  directly  support  cyber  operations (e.g., numbered air force staff, wing staff, OSS personnel, etc.). (T-3) 1.5.7.2.  Regular Air Force BMC crewmembers and activated ARC BMC crewmembers must  be  able  to  attain  MR  status  and,  if  required,  certification/qualification  in  30  days (respectively) (T-2). 1.5.7.3.  BMC  crewmembers  accomplish  all  mission  related  training  designated  by  the RTM     (T-3). 1.5.7.4.  Current,  proficient,  and  certified/qualified  BMC  crewmembers  may  participate in missions as determined by the SQ/CC. 1.5.7.5.  Failure to complete required BMC training results in regression to non-BMC (N-BMC)  status.    While  N-BMC,  SQ/CC  will  determine  missions  the  crewmembers  may perform and the supervision required. (T-3)    AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 9 1.6.  Training Concepts and Policies: 1.6.1.  Units  will  design  training  programs  to  achieve  the  highest  degree  of  readiness consistent with safety and resource availability.  Training must balance the need for realism against  the  expected  threat,  crew  capabilities,  and  safety.    This  volume  provides  training guidelines and polices for use with operational procedures specified in applicable operational publications. (T-3) 1.6.2.  Design  training  to  achieve  mission  capability  in  squadron-tasked  roles,  maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety.  RCP training missions should emphasize  either  basic  combat  skills,  or  scenarios  that  reflect  procedures  and  operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition capabilities.  Use of procedures and actions applicable to mission scenarios are desired. (T-3) 1.6.3.  Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervision necessary to  accomplish  the  required  training.  An  instructor  is  required  if  mission  objectives  include introduction  to  new  or  modified  tasks  and/or  instruction  to  correct  previous  discrepancies. (T-3) 1.7.  Experienced Crewmember Requirements.  CSCS crewmembers are declared experienced on the weapon system when they meet the requirements in Table 1.1. (T-3) Table 1.1.  Experienced Crewmember Requirements (T-2). Position Boundary Protection Operator (CSCS-BPO) Client End Point Protection Operator (CSCS-CPO) Directory Services Operator (CSCS-DSO) Infrastructure Operator (CSCS-IFO) Monitoring Management Operator (CSCS-MMO) Storage and Virtualization Operator (CSCS-SVO) Vulnerability Assessment Operator (CSCS-VAO) Vulnerability Remediation Operator (CSCS-VRO) Crew Commander (CSCS-CC) Operations Controller (CSCS-OC) Declared Experienced (Hours) 450 450 450 450 450 450 450 450 850 450 Notes 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1, 2, 3, 4 1, 5 1. Crewmembers begin acquiring experience hours upon the successful completion of MQT. 2. Requires the successful completion of 67 CW Mission Commander Course. 3. CSCS-CC responsibilities can be assumed by crewmembers, not additional personnel.  4. Msn/CC / Pkg/CC are responsibilities assumed by CSCS-CC when executing large force employment missions. 5. The Operations Controller position can be assumed by crewmembers, not additional personnel.   1.7.1.  Specialized Training. Specialized training is any special skill necessary to perform the unit's  assigned  mission  not  required  by  every  crewmember.  Specialized  training  consists  of upgrade training, such as instructor upgrade, etc. 10 AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 1.7.2.  Specialized  training  is  accomplished  after  the  crewmember  is  assigned  MR  or  BMC status. Unless otherwise specified, crewmembers in MR or BMC positions may hold special mission  qualifications  or  certifications  as  long  as  any  basic  training  requirements  are accomplished.  Table 1.2 identifies Specialized Mission Training Requirements. (T-3) Table 1.2.  Minimum Upgrade and Specialized Mission Training Requirements. Upgrading From Any Position Upgrading To Prerequisites Instructor Experienced (any position); Instructor Training Course Tasks & Events to Complete Upgrade Instructor Qual &  SQ/CC certification Notes  * Commanders must ensure each candidate has the ability, judgement, technical expertise, skill, and experience when selecting a crewmember for upgrade or specialized mission training.  1.8.  RCP Guidance and Management: 1.8.1.  The  RCP  training  cycle  is  aligned  with  the  fiscal  year  and  executed  IAW  the  RCP Tasking Memo (RTM). Each RCP status (i.e., MR or BMC) is defined by a total number of RCP  missions,  events,  and  associated  currencies  as  determined  by  Higher  Headquarters (HHQ) guidance and unit commanders. (T-3) 1.8.2.  The  total  number  of  missions  and  events  for  MR  or  BMC  is  the  primary  factor  for maintaining an individual's RCP status. Failure to accomplish all training requirements may lead to an individual’s regression by the SQ/CC, IAW HHQ guidance. (T-3) 1.8.3.  An  effective  RCP  mission  requires  accomplishing  a  tactical  mission  or  training mission, and completion of the RCP mission/events. 1.8.4.  Log non-effective sorties when a training sortie is planned and started, but a majority of  valid  training  for  that  type  of  mission  is  not  accomplished  due  to  system  malfunction, power failures, etc. Non-effective sorties will be logged and reported appropriately. (T-3) 1.8.5.  Progression from BMC to MR requires: 1.8.5.1.  A 1-month lookback (4 months for ARC) at the MR mission rate. (T-3) 1.8.5.2.  Certification/qualification in all core missions and events required at MR. (T-3) 1.8.5.3.  Confirmation the progressed crewmember can complete the prorated number of mission and event requirements remaining at MR by the end of the training cycle. Refer to Proration of Training, paragraph 4.10. (T-3) 1.8.5.4.  Completion  of  mission-related  training,  to  include  a  current  certification  as applicable to the assigned unit’s DOC statement. (T-3) 1.8.6.  MR  and  BMC  crewmember  will  complete  the  required  monthly  mission/events requirements. If unable, refer to Regression, paragraph 4.9 (T-3). 1.8.7.  End of cycle training requirements are based on the crewmember’s experience level, as outlined in paragraph 1.7, on the last day of the current training cycle. (T-3)  AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 11 1.9.  Training Mission Program Development: 1.9.1.  RTM  MR  or  BMC  mission  and  event  requirements  apply  to  all  MR  and  BMC crewmembers,  as  well  as  those  carrying  special  mission  certifications/qualifications  (see Attachment 2). The standard mission requirements listed in the RTM establish the minimum number of missions per training cycle for MR and BMC levels of training.  The RTM takes precedence  over  this  volume  and  may  contain  updated  requirements,  missions,  events,  or tasks  not  yet  incorporated  into  Attachment  2.    The  RTM  applies  to  all  CSCS  Cybercrew personnel. (T-3) 1.10.  Training Records and Reports: 1.10.1.  Units  will  maintain  crewmember  records  for  individual  training  and  evaluations IAW: 1.10.1.1.  AFI 17-202V1, Cybercrew Training (T-3) 1.10.1.2.  AFI 17-202V2, Cybercrew Standardization and Evaluation Program (T-3) 1.10.1.3.  Any additional HHQ supplement to the above-mentioned volumes (T-3) 1.10.2.  Track the following information for all crewmembers (as applicable): 1.10.2.1.  Mission-related  training  (e.g.,  tactics  training,  crew  resource  management training, etc.). (T-3) 1.10.2.2.  Requirements  and  accomplishment  of  individual  sorties,  mission  types,  and events cumulatively for the training cycle. (T-3) 1.10.2.3.  RCP  mission  requirements  and  accomplishment  using  1-month  and  3-month running totals for lookback commensurate with CT status (MR or BMC). (T-3) 1.10.2.3.1.  One-Month  Sortie  Lookback:  Total  individual  RCP  sorties  tracked  for  a 30-day time period. This lookback is used to assess individual progress in achieving the Total Sorties (minimum) required for the 12-month training cycle. 1.10.2.3.2.  Three-Month Sortie Lookback: Total individual RCP sorties tracked for a 90-day time period. This lookback is used to assess individual progress in achieving the Total Sorties (minimum) required for the 12-month training cycle. 1.10.2.3.3.  ARC  will  use  4  and  6  month  lookbacks.  Utilize  loopback  to  assess individual progress  to  achieve the Total  Sorties  (minimum) required for the training cycle. (T-3) 1.11.  Crewmember Utilization Guidance: 1.11.1.  Commanders  will  ensure  wing/group  crewmembers  (CPI-1/-2/-A)  fill  authorized positions  IAW  Unit  Manning  Documents  (UMD)  and  crewmember  status  is  properly designated (see Attachment 3 for CPI explanation and definitions).  The overall objective is for crewmembers to perform mission-related duties. Supervisors may assign crewmembers to valid,  short-term  tasks  (escort  officer,  operational  review  board  (ORB),  etc.,)  but  must continually  weigh  the  factors  involved,  such  as  level  of  crewmember  tasking,  proficiency, currency,  and  experience.  For  inexperienced  crewmembers  in  the  first  year  of  their  initial operational  assignment,  supervisors  should  limit  non-crew  duties  to  those  related  to  unit mission activities. (T-3) 12 AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 1.11.2.  Use evaluators as instructors for any phase of training to capitalize on their expertise and experience.   If  an evaluator is  an individual’s primary or recommending instructor, the same evaluator shall not administer the associated evaluation. (T-3) 1.12.  Sortie Allocation and Unit Manpower Guidance: 1.12.1.  In general, inexperienced CPI-1/-2/-A/-Z crewmembers should receive priority over experienced crewmembers. (T-3) 1.12.2.  There  is  no  maximum  sortie  requirement  for  MR  crewmembers.  The  RTM  defines the minimum sortie requirements for crewmembers per training cycle. (T-3) 1.13.  Training  on  Operational  Missions.  Unless  specifically  prohibited  or  restricted  by weapons  system  operating  procedures,  specific  theater  operations  order  (OPORD),  or  specific HHQ  guidance, the  OG/CC  exercising  operational  control  may  approve  upgrade, certification/qualification  or  special  certification/qualification  training  on  operational  missions. In  order  to  maximize  efficient  utilization  of  training  resources,  units  will  take  maximum advantage of opportunities to  conduct  appropriate CT items  that may be conveniently suited to concurrent operational mission segments. (T-3) 1.14.  In-Unit Training Time Limitations: 1.14.1.  Comply with the time limitations in Table 1.3.  Crewmembers entered in an in-unit training program leading to qualification, requalification, or certification will be dedicated to that training program on a full-time basis (the OG/CC is the waiver authority). (T-3) 1.14.2.  Training time start date is the date when the first significant training event (a training event  directly  contributing  to  qualification,  certification,  or  upgrade)  has  begun,  or  45-days (90  days  ARC)  after  being  attached  or  assigned  to  the  unit  after  completion  of  the  Formal Training  Unit  (FTU);  whichever  occurs  first.  Training  time  ends  with  the  syllabus completion. (T-3) 1.14.3.  If member is projected to exceed the training cycle, units will notify the OG/CC (or equivalent) in writing before the crewmember exceeds upgrade training time limits in Table 1.3.  SQ/CCs  may  extend  listed  training  times  up  to  60  days  (120  days  ARC)  provided appropriate justification is documented in the crewmember’s training folder. (T-3) 1.14.3.1.  Include  training  difficulty,  unit  corrective  action  to  resolve  and  prevent recurrence, and estimated completion date.   AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 13 Table 1.3.

Unless  another  approval  authority  is  cited  ("T-0,  T-1,  T-2,  T-3"),  waiver authority for this volume is the MAJCOM/A3 (or equivalent).  Submit requests for waivers using AF Form 679 through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority. If approved, waivers remain in effect for the life of the published guidance, unless the waiver authority specifies a shorter period of time, cancels in writing, or issues a change that alters the basis for the waiver. 1.16.2.  With MAJCOM/A3 (or equivalent) approval, waiver authority for all requirements of the  RTM  is  the  OG/CC.  Additional  guidance  may  be  provided  in  the  memo.  Unless specifically  noted  otherwise  in  the  appropriate  section,  and  also  with  MAJCOM/A3  (or equivalent)  approval,  the  OG/CC  may  adjust  individual  requirements  in  Chapter  4  and Chapter  5, on a case-by-case basis, to accommodate variations in  crewmember  experience and performance. (T-2)  14 AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 1.16.3.  Formal School Training and Prerequisites. Any planned exception to a formal course syllabus  (or  prerequisite)  requires  a  syllabus  waiver.  Submit  waiver  request  through MAJCOM/A3T  (or  equivalent)  to  the  waiver  authority  listed  in  the  course  syllabus.  If required  for  units'  designated  mission,  events  waived  or  not  accomplished  at  the  formal school will be accomplished in-unit before assigning MR status. (T-2) 1.16.4.  In-Unit  Training  Waiver.  MAJCOM/A3T  (or  equivalent)  is  approval/waiver authority  for  in-unit  training  to  include  syllabus  and  prerequisite  waivers.  Before  approval, review  the  appropriate  syllabus  and  consider  availability  of  formal  instruction  and requirements. All in-unit training will utilize formal courseware in accordance with AFI 17-202V1. MAJCOMs will coordinate with the FTU to arrange courseware delivery to the unit for in-unit training. (T-2) 1.16.5.  Waiver  authority  for  supplemental  guidance  will  be  as  specified  in  the  supplement and approved through higher level coordination authority. (T-2) 1.16.6.

This chapter outlines CSCS IQT requirements for all crewmember personnel. 2.2.  Formal  Training.  CSCS  IQT  includes  training  normally  conducted  during  FTU  formal syllabus courses. 2.3.  Local  Training.  In circumstances when FTU training is not available within a reasonable time period, local  IQT may be performed at the unit IAW the provisions of this chapter. Local IQT will be conducted using appropriate FTU course syllabi and requirements. When local IQT is authorized, the gaining unit assumes responsibility for providing this training. (T-3) 2.3.1.  Requests to conduct local IQT will include the following: 2.3.1.1.  Justification for the local training in lieu of FTU training. (T-3) 2.3.1.2.  Summary of individual's mission related experience, to include dates. (T-3) 2.3.1.3.  Date training will begin and expected completion date. (T-3) 2.3.1.4.  Requested exceptions to FTU syllabus, with rationale. (T-3) 2.4.  Mission-Related  Training.  Current  and  available  reference  materials,  such  as  AFTTP  3-1.CSCS, other applicable AFTTP 3-1s and 3-3s, unit guides, and other available training material and programs, will be used as supporting materials to the maximum extent possible. (T-3) 2.5.  Mission Training: 2.5.1.  Mission sequence and prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate FTU syllabus (unless waived). (T-3) 2.5.2.  Training  will  be  completed  within  the  time  specified  by  the  syllabus.    Failure  to complete  within  the  specified  time  limit  requires  notification  through  channels  to MAJCOM/A3  (or  equivalent)  with  crewmember’s  name,  rank,  reason  for  delay,  planned actions, and estimated completion date. (T-3) 2.5.3.  Crewmember in IQT will train under the appropriate supervision directed by the FTU syllabus until completing the QUAL evaluation. (T-2) 2.5.4.  FTU  syllabus  mission  objectives  and  tasks  are  minimum  requirements  for  IQT. However,  additional  training  events,  based  on  student  proficiency  and  background,  may  be incorporated  into  the  IQT  program  with  SQ/CC  authorization.    Additional  training  due  to student non-progression is  available within the constraints of the FTU syllabus and may be added at SQ/CC discretion. 2.6.  IQT for Senior Officers: 2.6.1.  All senior officer training (Colonel selects and above) will be conducted at the FTUs unless waived IAW AFI 17-202v1. (T-2) 2.6.2.  Senior  officers  must  meet  course  entry  prerequisites  and  will  complete  all  syllabus requirements unless waived IAW AFI 17-202v1. (T-2) 16 AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 2.6.3.  If senior officers are trained at their assigned base, they will be considered in a formal training status for the course duration. Their duties will be delegated to the appropriate CDs or  CVs  until  training  is  completed.  Waiver  authority  for  this  paragraph  is  MAJCOM/CC (submitted through MAJCOM/A3 or equivalent). (T-2) AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 17 Chapter 3 MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING 3.1.  General  .    MQT  is  a  unit-developed  training  program  that  upgrades  IQT-complete crewmembers to BMC or MR status to accomplish the unit DOC statement missions.  Guidance in this chapter, which represents the minimum, is provided to assist SQ/CCs in developing their MQT  program,  which  must  have  OG/CC  approval  prior  to  use.    Squadrons  may  further  tailor their  program  for  individual  crewmembers,  based  on  current  qualifications  (e.g.,  United  States Air  Force  Weapons  School  (USAFWS)  graduate,  Instructor),  certifications  (e.g.,  MC, Stan/Eval), experience, currency, documented performance, and formal training.  Squadrons may use  applicable  portions  of  MQT  to  create  a  recertification  program  for  crewmembers  that regressed from MR to BMC status. (T-3) 3.1.1.  MQT will be completed within 90 calendar days (180 days for ARC) starting from the day after IQT completion or the crewmember’s first duty day in the gaining unit if IQT was completed prior to arrival. If the crewmember elects to take leave prior to entering MQT, the timing will begin  after leave termination. Training is complete upon SQ/CC certification of MR or BMC status (subsequent to the successful completion of the MQT MSN qualification evaluation).  Notify  MAJCOM/A3T  (through  MAJCOM/A3TT  or  equivalent)  either  if training  exceeds  the  90-day  time  period  or  there  is  a  delay  beginning  MQT  (e.g.,  due  to security clearance) that exceeds 30 days (180 days for ARC). (T-3) 3.2.  Mission-Related Training: 3.2.1.  Units will develop instructions addressing areas pertinent to the mission as determined by the SQ/CC. Training accomplished during IQT may be credited towards this requirement. (T-3) 3.2.2.  Mission-related training may be tailored to the individual's background and experience or particular local conditions.  Current and available reference materials, such as AFTTP 3-1.CSCS,  other  applicable  AFTTP  3-1s  and  3-3s,  unit  guides,  and  other  available  training material and programs, will be used as supporting materials to the maximum extent possible.

Mission-related  training  will  support  the  mission  and  concept  of  operations  of  the individual  squadron;  incorporate  appropriate  portions  of  AFTTP  3-1.CSCS  and  other mission-related documents. (T-3) 3.3.  Initial Certification 3.3.1.  Initial  Certification  of  MR  crewmembers  will  be  completed  within  30  days  after completing MQT (recommended, but not required for BMC crewmember). Failure to comply will result in regression to NMR until complete.  Suggested briefing guides are at Attachment 3.    Each  crewmember  will  demonstrate  to  a  formal  board  a  satisfactory  knowledge  of  the squadron’s primary DOC statement missions.  Board composition will be established by the SQ/CC.  Desired composition is SQ/CC or SQ/DO (chairman), weapons and tactics, training, intelligence, and other mission-area expert representatives. (T-3) 3.4.  Mission Training: 3.4.1.  At  SQ/CC  discretion,  applicable  missions  from  those  listed  below  will  be  used  to build  the  unit  MQT  program.  MQT  programs  should  use  profiles  typical  of  squadron missions. 3.4.2.  Supervision.  A  squadron  instructor  is  required  for  all  training  missions  unless specified otherwise. (T-3) 3.4.3.  Minimum  Sortie  Requirements.    The  minimum  sorties  required  in  a  local  MQT program will be IAW the MQT course syllabus (not required if portions of the MQT program are  used  to  recertify  crewmembers  that  regressed  from  MR  to  BMC).  Reference  the paragraphs  below  for  further  details  and  recommended  sortie  flows  the  SQ/CC  may  use  to develop the unit's MQT program. (T-2) 3.4.4.  Mission  sequence  and  prerequisites  will  be  IAW  the  appropriate  unit  MQT  course syllabus (unless waived) (T-2). 3.4.5.  Mission  Objectives:  Be  familiar  with  local  area  requirements  and  procedures.  Specific  Mission  Tasks:  local  area  familiarization,  emergency  procedures  and  other  tasks determined by the unit. (T-3) 3.4.6.  Individual events may be accomplished anytime during MQT, however all events will be accomplished prior to SQ/CC certification of MR or BMC status (T-3). 3.4.7.  Mission Types. Current Special Instructions (SPINS) define CSCS mission types. 3.4.7.1.  Reference standing SPINS for mission type definitions. 3.4.8.  Training  will  be  completed  within  the  time  specified  by  the  syllabus.    Failure  to complete  within  the  specified  time  limit  requires  notification  through  channels  to  the MAJCOM/A3T  or  equivalent  with  crewmember’s  name,  rank,  reason  for  delay,  planned actions, and estimated completion date. (T-3) 3.4.9.  Crewmembers in MQT will train under the appropriate supervision as annotated in the FTU syllabus until completing the qualification evaluation. (T-2)   AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 19 3.4.10.  FTU  syllabus  mission  objectives  and  tasks  are  minimum  requirements  for  MQT. However,  additional  training  events,  based  on  student  proficiency  and  background,  may  be incorporated  into  the  MQT  program  with  SQ/CC  authorization.  Additional  training  due  to student non-progression is  available within the constraints of the FTU syllabus and may be added at SQ/CC discretion. 3.5.  MQT for Senior Officers: 3.5.1.  All  senior  officer  training  (Colonel  selects  and  above)  will  be  conducted  at  the  unit. (T-2) 3.5.2.  Senior  officers  must  meet  course  entry  prerequisites  and  will  complete  all  syllabus requirements unless waived by the MAJCOM/A3. (T-2) 3.5.3.  Senior  officers  will  be  considered  in  a  formal  training  status  for  the  duration  of  the course.  Their duties will be delegated to appropriate CDs or CVs until training is completed. Waiver  authority  for  this  paragraph  is  the  MAJCOM/CC  (submitted  through  the MAJCOM/A3). (T-2) 20 AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General.  This  chapter  establishes  the  minimum  crewmember  training  requirements  to maintain  MR  or  BMC  status  for  an  assigned  training  status.    The  SQ/CC  will  ensure  each crewmember receives sufficient training to maintain individual currency and proficiency (T-3). 4.2.  Crewmember  Status.  SQ/CCs  will  assign  crewmembers  a  status  using  the  following criteria: 4.2.1.  Mission Ready (MR). A crewmember member who satisfactorily completed IQT and MQT, and maintains qualification, certification, currency and proficiency in the command or unit operational mission. 4.2.1.1.  The  crewmember  shall  be  able  to  attain  full  unit  mission  certification  to  meet operational tasking within 30 days (T-2). 4.2.2.  Non-Mission  Ready  (NMR).  A  crewmember  that  is  unqualified,  non-current  or incomplete in required continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission. 4.2.3.  MR and BMC crewmembers will accomplish and/or maintain RCP requirements, for their respective status, and the appropriate events in the RCP tables in this Instruction and the RTM. (T-3) 4.2.4.  Crewmembers  will  maintain  all  required  certifications  to  operate  on  the  network  or will be subject to decertification if those requirements are not met. (T-3) 4.3.  Training  Events/Tables.  Standardized  training  event  identifiers  and  descriptions  are located in Attachment 2.  Units will include unit-specific events to include a description in their local training documentation. (T-3) 4.3.1.  Crediting Event Accomplishment. Credit events accomplished on training, operational missions and satisfactory evaluations or certifications toward RCP requirements and establish a  due  date.    Use  the  date  of  successful  evaluation  as  the  date  of  accomplishment  for  all mission-related  training  events  accomplished  during  a  formal  course.    A  successful evaluation establishes a new current and qualified reference date for all accomplished events.  For training during IQT or requalification training, numbers of events accomplished prior to the  evaluation  are  not  credited  to  any  crew  position.    In  all  cases,  numbers  of  events successfully accomplished during the evaluation or certification are credited toward the crew position. (T-3) 4.3.2.  For an unsatisfactory evaluation, do not log CT requirements for those events graded U/Q3 (according to AFI 17-202V2) until re-qualified. (T-3) 4.3.3.  Instructors and evaluators may credit up to 50 percent  of their total CT requirements while instructing or evaluating.    AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 21 4.4.  Continuation  Training  Requirements.  Completion and tracking of continuation training is  ultimately  the  responsibility  of  the  individual  crewmember.    Crewmembers  should  actively work  with  their  supervisors,  unit  schedulers  and  training  offices  to  ensure  accomplishment  of their  continuation  training  requirements.    Attached  crewmembers  are  responsible  for  reporting accomplished training events to their attached unit. (T-3) 4.4.1.  Mission-Related  Training  Events.    Crewmembers  will  comply  with  requirements  of Table 4.1. Failure to accomplish events in Table 4.1 leads to NMR status (T-2). 4.4.1.1.  Weapons  and  Tactics  Academic  Training.    Units  will  establish  a  weapons  and tactics  academic  training  program  to  satisfy  MQT  and  CT  requirements.  Training  is required semi-annually during each training cycle. SQ/CCs will provide guidance to unit weapons shops to ensure all crewmembers are informed/reminded of all CSCS weapons, systems and mission-specific TTP (T-2). 4.4.1.1.1.  Academic  instructors  should  be  Weapons  Instructor  Course  (WIC) graduates. 4.4.1.1.2.  Instruction should include (as applicable), but is not limited to (T-3): 4.4.1.1.2.1.  Applicable  AF  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  (AFTTP)  3-1 and 3-3 series publications, AFI 17-2CSCS Volume 3,  Cyberspace  Security  and Control  System  (CSCS)  Operations  Procedures,  and  other  documents  pertaining to the execution of the unit mission. 4.4.1.1.2.2.  Specialized  training  to  support  specific  weapons,  tactics,  mission capabilities, rules of engagement (ROE), and other mission related activities. 4.4.1.2.  Risk  Management  (RM).  Crewmembers  will  participate  in  RM  training  once every  training  cycle.    Briefings  will  include  the  concepts  outlined  in  AFPAM  90-803, Risk Management (RM) Guidelines and Tools.  RM training will be tracked.  Failure to complete RM training will result in NMR status. Table 4.1.  CSCS Cybercrew Mission-Related CT Requirements. Position All All Frequency 179d 365d Event Weapons & Tactics Risk Management Code GTR002 GTR003 Notes:  1.  “d” is the maximum number of days between events. 2. Failure to complete this event within the time prescribed leads to NMR status.  Crewmembers will not be able to accomplish unsupervised crew duties until the delinquent event is accomplished or waived. (T-3) Notes 1, 2 1, 2 4.4.2.  Mission  Training  Events.   Crewmembers  will comply  with  requirements of the RCP Tasking  Memorandum  (RTM)  for  their  respective  position.    Total  sorties  and  events  are minimums which ensure training to continually meet all DOC tasked requirements and may not  be  reduced  except  in  proration/waiver.    Unless  specifically  noted  the  OG/CC  is  the waiver authority for all RCP requirements and for all provisions in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 of this volume.  Failure to accomplish events in these tables may lead to NMR status. (T-3) 22 AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 4.5.  Specialized  Mission  Training.  Specialized  training  is  normally  accomplished  after  a crewmember is assigned MR or BMC status. Unless otherwise specified, crewmembers in MR or BMC  positions  may  hold  special  mission  certifications  as  long  as  additional  training requirements are accomplished. (See Chapter 5) (T-3) 4.5.1.  The  SQ/CC  will  determine  which  crewmembers  will  train  for  and  maintain  special mission qualifications and certifications. (T-3) 4.6.  Currencies, Recurrencies and Requalification. 4.6.1.  Currency.  The RTM defines currency requirements for MR and BMC crewmembers. Crewmembers  may  not  instruct,  evaluate  or  perform  any  event  in  which  they  are  not qualified and current unless under instructor supervision.  (T-3) Currency may be established or updated by: 4.6.1.1.  Accomplishing  the  event  as  a  qualified  crewmember  provided  member’s currency has not expired. (T-3) 4.6.1.2.  Accomplishing  the  event  as  a  qualified  crewmember  under  supervision  of  a current instructor. (T-3) 4.6.1.3.  Events  satisfactorily  performed  on  any  evaluation  may  be  used  to  establish  or update currency in that event. (T-3) 4.6.2.  If  a  crewmember  is  non-current,  thereby  requiring  recurrency,  that  mission  or  event may not be performed except for the purpose of regaining currency. Non-current events must be  satisfied  before  the  crewmember  is  considered  certified/qualified  (as  applicable)  to perform  those  events  unsupervised.    Loss  of  currencies  affecting  MR  status  will  require regression to  BMC (see paragraph 4.9); loss of currencies not affecting MR status does not require regression (T-3). 4.7.  Loss  of  Instructor  Status  and  Requalification/Recurrency.  Instructors  may  lose instructor status for the following: 4.7.1.  Loss of currency for greater than 180 days. (T-3) 4.7.2.  They  become  noncurrent  in  a  mission  or  event  which  causes  removal  from  MR  or BMC status and the SQ/CC deems that loss of currency is of sufficient importance to require complete decertification (but not a complete loss of qualification). (T-3) 4.7.2.1.  If the affected crewmember retains instructor qualification IAW AFI 17-202V2, recertification will be at the SQ/CC’s discretion. (T-3) 4.7.2.2.  If  the  SQ/CC  does  not  elect  to  decertify  the  individual  or  if  the  individual becomes  non-current  in  missions  or  events,  which  do  not  require  removal  from  MR status, instructor status may be retained, but the instructor will not instruct that mission or event until the required currency is regained. (T-3) 4.7.3.  Instructor  Lack  of  Ability.    Instructors  serve  solely  at  the  discretion  of  the  SQ/CC.  Instructors should exemplify a higher level of performance and present themselves as reliable and  authoritative  experts  in  their  respective  duty  positions.   Instructors  exhibiting substandard performance should be reviewed for suitability of continued instructor duty. (T-3)  Instructors will be decertified if: AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 23 4.7.3.1.  Awarded a less than fully qualified grade in any area of the evaluation regardless of overall crew position qualification. (T-3) 4.7.3.2.  Failure of a qualification. (T-3) 4.7.3.3.  SQ/CC  deems  instructor  is  substandard,  ineffective,  or  providing  incorrect procedures, techniques, or policy guidance. (T-3) 4.7.3.4.  Decertified instructors may regain  instructor status  by  correcting the applicable deficiency and completing the training and/or evaluation as specified by the SQ/CC. (T-3) 4.8.  Regression. 4.8.1.  MR or BMC Regression for  Failure  to  Meet  Lookback. Only RCP training missions and  cyberspace  operations  sorties  may  be  used  for  lookback.  If  the  crewmember  does  not meet  lookback  requirements  throughout  the  training  cycle,  SQ/CC  can  regress  the crewmember from MR to BMC or NMR. (T-3) 4.8.1.1.  Failure  to  meet  one-month  lookback  requires  a  review  of  the  crewmember’s three-month sortie history. If the three-month lookback is met, the crewmember may, at SQ/CC  discretion,  remain  in  MR  or  BMC  status.  Failure  to  meet  the  three-month lookback  will  result  in  regression  to  BMC  or  NMR/N-BMC,  as  applicable,  or  the crewmember may be placed in supervised status at the SQ/CC's discretion. If probation is chosen, the only way to remove a crewmember from probation and preserve the current status  is  to  reestablish  a  1-month  lookback  at  the  end  of  the  probation  period.  ARC utilizes 4-month lookback and 6-month lookback instead of 1-month and 3-month. (T-3) 4.8.1.2.  Lookback computations begin following completion of MQT.  The crewmember must  maintain  1-month  lookback  until  a  3-month  lookback  is  possible.  SQ/CCs  may apply  supervisory  rules  as  described  in  paragraph  4.8.1.1  if  a  new  MR  or  BMC crewmember  fails  to  meet  currency  and  proficiency  requirements  during  the  1-month lookback while establishing 3-month lookback.  In addition, 1-month lookback will start the first full month of MR or BMC status. (T-3) 4.8.1.3.  ARC replaces 1-month lookback with 4-month lookback and 3-month lookback with 6-month lookback. (T-3) 4.8.2.  Regression  for  Failed  Evaluations.  Crewmembers  who  fail  a  periodic  evaluation  are unqualified  and  will  regress  to  NMR  as  applicable.  Crewmembers  will  remain  NMR  until successfully  completing  required  corrective  action(s),  re-evaluation  and  SQ/CC  re-certification (T-3). 4.8.3.  Failure  to  Maintain  Standards.    If  a  qualified  crewmember  demonstrates  lack  of proficiency  or  knowledge,  the  SQ/CC  may  elect  to  regress  the  individual  to  NMR  as applicable. These crewmembers will remain NMR until successful completion of corrective action  as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC,  an  evaluation  if  required,  and  re-certification  by  the SQ/CC. (T-3) 4.9.  End-of-Cycle  Requirements.  Crewmembers  who  fail  to  complete  mission  or  event requirements by the end of training cycle may require additional training depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency.  Refer to paragraph 4.11 for proration guidance.  In all cases, units will report training shortfalls to the OG/CC. (T-3) 24 AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 4.9.1.  Crewmembers  failing  to  meet  annual  RCP  events  or  minimum  total  sortie requirements may continue CT at MR or BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is required. 4.9.2.  Failure to meet specific MR or BMC mission type requirements will result in one of the following: 4.9.2.1.  Regression  to  NMR  if  the  SQ/CC  determines  the  mission  type  deficiency  is significant.    To  regain  MR  or  BMC  status,  the  crewmember  will  complete  all  deficient mission types.  These missions may also count toward the total requirements for the new training cycle. (T-3) 4.9.2.2.  Continuation  at  MR  or  BMC  status  if  total  RCP  missions  and  lookback  are maintained  and  the  mission  type  deficiencies  are  deemed  insignificant  by  the  SQ/CC.  The SQ/CC will determine if any additional training is required to address shortfall. (T-3) 4.9.3.  Failure  to  accomplish  missions/events  required  for  Special  Mission  capabilities  or certifications/qualifications will result in loss of that certification/qualification.  The SQ/CC will determine recertification requirements.  Requalification requirements are  IAW AFI 17-202V2  applicable  HHQ  guidance,  and  AFI  17-2CSCS  Volume  2,  Cyberspace  Security  and Control System (CSCS) Standardization and Evaluations. (T-3) 4.10.  Proration of Training. 4.10.1.  Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements.  At the end of the training cycle the SQ/CC may prorate any training requirements precluded by the following events: initial arrival date in  squadron,  emergency  leave,  non-mission  TDYs,  exercises,  or  deployments.    Ordinary annual leave will not be considered as non-availability.  Other extenuating circumstances, as determined by the SQ/CC, that prevent the crewmember from mission duties for more than 15 consecutive days may be considered as non-availability for proration purposes. (T-3) The following guidelines apply: 4.10.1.1.  Proration will not be used to mask training or planning deficiencies. (T-3) 4.10.1.2.  Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for mission duties in the training cycle.  Use Table 4.2 to determine the number of months to be prorated based on each period of cumulative non-mission duty calendar days. (T-3) 4.10.1.3.  If MQT is re-accomplished, a crewmember’s training cycle will start over at a prorated share following completion of MQT. (T-3) 4.10.1.4.  No  requirement  may  be  prorated  below  one.    Prorated  numbers  resulting  in fractions  of  less  than  0.5  will  be  rounded  to  the  next  lower  whole  number  (one  or greater). (T-3) 4.10.1.5.  Newly  assigned  crewmembers  achieving  MR  or  BMC  status  after  the  15th  of the month are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration purposes.  A prorated share of RCP missions must be completed in CT. (T-3)   AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 25 4.10.1.6.  A  crewmember’s  last  month  on  station  prior  to  PCSing  may  be  prorated provided  1  month's  proration  is  not  exceeded.    Individuals  PCSing  may  be  considered MR for reporting purposes during a period of 60 days from date of last mission/sortie, or until loss of MR currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty station, whichever occurs first. 4.10.1.7.  Activated  Reserve  Augmentation  Unit  (RAU)  members  will  maintain  active duty proficiencies and currency requirements prorated for the duration they are on orders. (T-3) 4.11.  Operational  Missions.  The  following  procedures  are  intended  to  provide  flexibility  in accomplishing  the  unit's  CT  program.  Sorties  conducted  during  operational  missions  will  be logged.    These  sorties  count  toward  annual  RCP  requirements  and  will  be  used  for  lookback purposes.    Operational  missions  and  events  may  be  used  to  update  proficiency/currency requirements if they meet the criteria in Attachment 2. (T-3) 4.11.1.  Example:  Capt  Jones  was  granted  17  days  of  emergency  leave  in  January  and attended SOS in residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days.  The SQ/CC  authorized  a  total  of  two  months  proration  from  his  training  cycle  (two  months  for the 73 cumulative days of non-availability). Table 4.2.  Proration Allowance. CUMULATIVE DAYS OF NON-MISSION ACTIVITY  0 – 15 16 – 45  46 – 75  76 – 105  106 – 135  136 – 165 166 – 195 196 – 225  226 – 255  256 – 285  286 – 315  316 – 345  Over 345  PRORATION ALLOWED (Months) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 4.12.  Regaining MR or BMC Status. 4.12.1.  If  MR  or  BMC  status  is  lost  due  to  failure  to  meet  the  end  of  cycle  event requirements, re-certification/re-qualification is IAW paragraph 4.10. (T-3) 4.12.2.  If MR or BMC status is lost due to failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.10, the following applies (timing starts from the date the crewmember came off MR or BMC status):  26 AFI17-2CSCSV1  11 MAY 2017 4.12.2.1.  Up  to  90  Days.    Complete  a  SQ/CC  approved  recertification  program (documented  in  the  individual’s  training  folder)  to  return  the  crewmember  to  MR  or BMC  standards.    Upon  completion  of  the  recertification  program,  the  MR  or  BMC crewmember  must  also  meet  the  subsequent  1-month  lookback  requirement  prior  to reclaiming  MR  or  BMC  status.    The  missions  and  events  accomplished  during  the recertification  program  may  be  credited  towards  their  total/type  mission  and  event requirements for the training cycle as well as for their monthly mission requirement.  In addition, all RCP event currencies must be regained.  The SQ/CC will approve any other additional training prior to MR recertification. (T-3) 4.12.2.2.  91-180  Days.   Same  as  above,  plus  open/closed  book  qualification examinations (IAW AFI 17-202V2.  Open/closed book exams will be documented IAW AFI 17-202V2. (T-3) 4.12.2.3.  181  Days  and  Beyond.
