General.  This  instruction  governs  the  Fighter  Aircrew  Acceleration  Training  Program, which teaches the physiological stresses of acceleration and aircrew flight equipment associated with modern high-G military aviation and prepares the trainee to meet these challenges.  High-G aircraft  are  divided  into  two  broad  categories:  Type  1  and  Type  2.    Type  1  aircraft  are  those aircraft that fly mission profiles with G-levels between 5.0 and 7.5 G, while Type 2 aircraft are those aircraft that perform mission profiles with G-levels up to 9.0 G. 1.2.  Acceleration Training Program Goals.  Prepare rated aircrew and other flyers for high-G flight and enhance combat capability and safety by optimizing aircrew defense against G-Loss of Consciousness  (GLOC).    This  is  accomplished  through  education  and  practical  experience including  physical  conditioning,  anti-G  equipment,  adequate  G-oriented  situational  awareness, the physiology of high-G flight, and an awareness of the factors that affect a crewmember’s G-tolerance.  This  instruction  addresses  only  the  centrifuge  training  portion  of  the  G  Awareness Program.  For information regarding continuation training requirements, see AFI 11-2F-16V1, F-16 Pilot Training, AFI 11-2F-15V1, F-15 Aircrew Training, AFI 11-2F-15EV1, F-15E Aircrew Training, AFI 11-2A/OA-10V1, A/OA-10 Aircrew Training, and AFI 11-2T/AT-38V1, T-38 and AT-38  Aircrew  Training,  AFI  11-2T-6V1T-6A  Aircrew  Training,  AFI  11-F/A-22V1F-22A Aircrew Training and AFI 11-2F-35Vol I, F-35 Aircrew Training. 1.2.1.  Centrifuge  training  is  a  vital  part  of  fighter  aircrew  acceleration  training.    The centrifuge is the best platform for teaching the proper Anti-G Straining Maneuver (AGSM).  Specifically, training shall: 1.2.1.1.  Train  and  evaluate  aircrew  on  a  properly  performed  AGSM  in  a  controlled environment. 1.2.1.2.  Address  strategies  to  improve  aircrew  performance  under  G-stress  through  the proper fit and use of protective equipment. 1.2.1.3.  Identify  aircrew  with  low  G-tolerance  and  poor  AGSM  skill  performance;  and provide remediation training as required. 1.3.  Waiver Authority.  Unless otherwise specified, AETC A2/3/10 is the waiver authority for the  provisions  of  this  instruction.  Send  waiver  requests  through  applicable  channels  to MAJCOM/A3  (or  equivalent).    As  applicable,  MAJCOM/A3s  will  forward  requests  for coordination to AETC/A2/3/10. 1.3.1.  MAJCOM  A3s  may  waive  refresher  centrifuge  training  for  aircrew  returning  to operational aircraft.  MAJCOM A3s must coordinate waiver requests for formal course entry requirements if other MAJCOMs own the formal training course. 1.3.2.

Flying  Squadron  Commanders  Fighter  Aircrew  Conditioning  Program (FACP) Roles and Responsibilities 1.4.6.3.1.  Work closely with the FACP instructor (or trained Air Force personnel at joint  training  sites  or  ANG/AFRC  units)  to  identify  those  students  that  may  need improved  G-fitness.    Several  factors  may  be  used  to  determine  that  a  student  needs improved  G-fitness,  including:  inadequate  AGSM  performance  in  the  aircraft, evidence of poor physical fitness, and indicators of AGSM error noted during Heads Up Display (HUD) tape reviews. 1.4.6.3.2.  Request  individualized  G-fitness  training  programs  for  flying  training students (as needed) from the FACP Instructor (or trained Air Force personnel at joint training  sites  or  ANG/AFRC  units)  when  appropriate.    For  instance,  a  student demonstrates early physical fatigue or difficulty in executing an effective AGSM. 1.4.6.3.3.  May delegate responsibilities listed in 1.4.6.3.1 to flight commanders. 1.4.6.3.4.  Ensure FACP Instructors use courseware provided by AETC/A3FM. 1.4.6.4.

AOP  Flight  Commander  ensures  that  AOP  officers,  fully  qualified technicians,  or  other  AF  personnel  at  joint  training  sites  or  ANG/AFRC  units  have been  trained  to  execute  the  FACP.  Document  this  training  in  the  FACP  instructor’s training records.  Any of the courses/certifications identified in para 4.5.2 fulfill this training  requirement:  Unit  of  assignment  will  ensure  adequate  resourcing  of  travel, supplies, and related costs necessary to qualify personnel to conduct FACP training. (T-3). 1.4.6.4.2.  FACP  Instructors.  Educate  students  per  syllabus  requirements.  FACP Instructor  demonstrates  a  variety  of  exercises  to  ensure  students  understand  proper form,  split  training  options  (using  more  than  one  exercise  per  muscle  group),  and variety to discourage stagnation and ensure conditioning progress.  Students will then demonstrate effective performance of each exercise following a warm-up period. 1.4.6.4.3.  Grounding. Due to fatigue and residual motion sickness, students will not fly  as  a  crew  member  for  a  period  of  12  hours  following  centrifuge  training  unless cleared by a flight surgeon. 1.4.6.5.

Personnel  Requiring  Acceleration  Training  .    Manned  high-G  aircraft  flight  is considered  particularly  high  risk  because  of  the  inability  of  the  human  operator  to  sustain consciousness during some flight maneuvers.  Rated aircrew and other flyers exposed to high-G flight require acceleration training to reduce risk by increasing individual awareness of personal limitations, to reduce the probability and potential for this element of human factors mishaps and increase  safety  measures  across  the  USAF.    Acceleration  academic  training,  such  as  briefings and  HUD  tape  reviews,  will  be  provided  IAW  relevant  11-2MDS  series  publications  and/or training syllabi. 2.2.  Personnel  Requiring  Centrifuge  Training.  All  USAF  rated  aircrew  assigned  to  high-G aircraft  are  required  to  successfully  complete  centrifuge  training  commensurate  with  their aircraft  G  capability.    For  aviators  assigned  to  a  flying  billet  in  Type  1  or  Type  2  aircraft, centrifuge  training  is  required  to  ensure  ability  to  perform  effective  AGSM.  Any  IPs  who evaluate  other  aircrew  on  their  AGSM  must  successfully  complete  a  minimum  of  Primary Acceleration  Training  (PAT).    Operations  Group  Commanders  will  determine  centrifuge requirements  for  any  nonrated  aircrew,  operations  support  flyers,  or  any  other  individuals assigned  aeronautical  orders  participating  in  high-G  flight  based  on  the  individual’s  duties  and anticipated G exposure. 2.2.1.  T-38  Special  Training  Requirements.    Pilots  flying  T-38  aircraft  are  required  to complete  PAT  unless  excluded  in  the  following  situations:  (1)  aircrew  that  fly  the  T-38 aircraft  only  for  landing  currency,  (2)  aircrew  that  fly  the  T-38  for  the  Companion  Trainer Program (CTP) if maneuvering is limited to less than 6.0 G, (3) or pilots in courses who will not continue flying USAF aircraft (e.g. USN Test Pilot School attendees).  Excepted aircrew are required to attend AGSM academic training conducted by a qualified AOP officer, flight surgeon or T-38 qualified IP and must be evaluated in the aircraft by a T-38 qualified IP. 2.2.2.  Unless  excepted  in    2.2.1  any  US  Navy,  US  Army,  US  Marine  Corps,  or  US  Coast Guard  rated  aircrew  member  who  will  perform  flight  duties  in  USAF  Type  1  or  Type  2 aircraft are required to successfully complete USAF acceleration training commensurate with their aircraft G capability. 2.2.3.  International  aircrew  flying  USAF  trainer  or  fighter  aircraft  who  have  met  USAF centrifuge  training  standards  as  documented  on  the  international  program  acceptance  letter are  not  required  to  complete  additional  USAF  centrifuge  training.    Documentation  of international  centrifuge training, including  the profiles completed, will be provided to local AOP personnel for review and documentation on AF Form 1274; questions on international documentation  will  be  referred  to  AETC/A3FM.    International  aircrew  that  have  no  prior centrifuge training, are noncurrent in centrifuge training, or trained in international centrifuge training programs with expired acceptance must retrain IAW this instruction. 2.2.4.  Passengers  scheduled  for  flight  aboard  Type  1  and  2  aircraft  will  receive  AGSM training  conducted  by  a  qualified  AOP  officer  or  flight  surgeon  no  earlier  than  72  hours before  flight.    IAW  AFI  11-403.  Para  2.1.9,  if  the  flight  is  not  accomplished  within  the  72 hours, training will be re-accomplished. AFI11-404  9 JUNE 2017 11 2.2.5.  Due to risk of injury, the individual’s commander must approve centrifuge training if not completed as part of a formal AFSC awarding course. 2.2.6.  Coordinate  all  other  ETP  requests  with  HQ  AETC/A3FM.  AETC/A3FM  is  the approval authority. 2.3.  Centrifuge  Training  Courses  :  Primary  Acceleration  Training  (PAT),  Advanced Acceleration  Training  (AAT),  Refresher  Acceleration  Training  (RAT),  Commander-Directed Acceleration Training (CDAT). 2.3.1.  Primary  Acceleration  Training  (PAT).  PAT  prepares  aircrew  for  Type  1  high-G flight.    PAT  is  normally  conducted  between  the  primary  (T-6/T-34)  and  advanced  (T-38) phases in Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) and Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) for pipeline student pilots. PAT may occur prior to completion of primary flight training. All students must successfully complete PAT before flying solo in the T-38.  Pipeline F-15E Combat Systems Officers (CSO) will receive this training after completion of CSO  training  and  before  first  flight  of  Introduction  to  Fighter  Fundamentals  (IFF).  Successful  completion  of  PAT  is  a  prerequisite  for  entry  into  the  A-10  and  F-15E  formal training  unit  (FTU)  courses;  previous  completion  of  PAT  is  sufficient  to  meet  this requirement.  For example, former F-15E CSOs who have previously passed 7.5 G Training or PAT, and are now a student in Undergraduate Pilot Training are not required to complete PAT a second time.  Additionally, pilots reporting to Type 1 training outside of SUPT/CSO pipeline must complete PAT training (e.g. C-17 pilot enrolled in Test Pilot School (TPS) who will fly T-38 in TPS). 2.3.2.  Advanced  Acceleration  Training  (AAT).  AAT is  designed to  illustrate differences in  Type  1  and  Type  2  flight.    Aircrew  with  previous  PAT  completion  selected  for,  or transitioning to F-15C, F-16, or F-22 aircraft will attend.  Successful completion of AAT is a prerequisite for entry into the F-15C, F-16, and F-22 FTU courses.  AAT may be completed upon  selection  to  Type  2  aircraft  but  must  be  successfully  completed  before  first  flight  at FTU. 2.3.3.  Refresher  Acceleration  Training  (RAT).  RAT  is  designed  for  aircrew  who previously  completed  AAT  and  who  are  returning  to  Type  2  aircraft  after  greater  than  39 months  in  a  non-flying  billet.    Aircrew  with  previous  centrifuge  training  have  solid foundations  in  G-awareness,  flight  discipline  and  risk  management  for  the  employment envelope and do not require refresher training if returning to the A-10, T-38, F-15E and F-35 aircraft after any non-flying duration. 2.3.4.  Commander-Directed  Acceleration  Training  (CDAT).  CDAT  is  available  to commanders  at  all  levels  to  address  an  aircrew’s  specific  AGSM  technique  problems  or  to build G-confidence in an aircrew’s AGSM. 2.3.5.  Non-pipeline  centrifuge  training  courses.  For  US  and  foreign  exchange  aircrew, inter-service transfer aircrew, flight surgeons, AOP officer, and other non-pipeline aircrew. 2.3.5.1.  Non-pipeline  aircrew  requiring  centrifuge  training  for  an  aircraft  other  than  F-15C, F-16, or F-22 will attend PAT. 12 AFI11-404  9 JUNE 2017 2.3.5.2.  Non-pipeline aircrew requiring centrifuge training for Type 2 (e.g. F-15C, F-16, or F-22) aircraft may attend AAT without first completing PAT; however, these aircrew must receive the platform academics associated with PAT. 2.4.  Authorized Centrifuge Training Facilities. 2.4.1.  Authorized  centrifuge  training  facilities  are  identified  in  the  Education  and  Training Course  Announcements  (ETCA)  site  https://etca.randolph.af.mil  .  Please  see  ETCA  for contact  information  for  scheduling  and  reporting.    ETCA  contacts  also  support  missing documentation requests. 2.4.2.  International  Centrifuge  Training  Facilities.    A  list  of  international  acceleration training  programs  that  provide  centrifuge  training  that  meets  USAF  requirements  is maintained by AETC/A3FM and located on the AF Portal 2.4.2.1.  Requests  for  USAF  acceptance  of  international  acceleration  training  programs should  be  initiated  through  the  appropriate  country  manager  who  coordinates  with AETC/A3FM  to  review  the  training  program.    Upon  request  from  SAF/IA  and/or AFSAT/DO,  AETC/A3FM  identifies  the  best  qualified  AOP  personnel  to  review  the requesting  country’s  acceleration/centrifuge  training  program.    Two  person  teams, consisting of a field grade 43A3 and a 4M071, will complete an in-country approval visit after  establishing  courseware  meets  training  standards.    SAF/IA  will  prioritize  and coordinate  with  AFSAT  to  fund  country  approval  requests.    AETC/A3FM  will  provide guidance and standardized evaluation checklists to the reviewer(s) to support this process.  The reviewer(s) will provide a written summary of their findings and recommendations to AETC/A3FM, who will then forward the recommendation and supporting documentation to AETC/A3F for approval of unconditional acceptance. (T-1).  Partner country programs training in centrifuge facilities adhering to NATO STANAG 3827 (Edition 5, 3 Sep 10 or more recent) may request expedited program acceptance via AETC/A3FM. 2.4.2.2.  Courseware  review  is  a  required  element  in  the  recognition  program  and  will include written instructor guides, student study guides, and program requirements. 2.4.2.3.  International  centrifuge  training  programs  must  be  reviewed  every  5  years  via this  coordination  process.    If  program  certification  has  lapsed,  AETC/A3FM  will coordinate  re-certification  process  and  may  require  a  site  visit;  re-acceptance  may  be accomplished via courseware review only, if personnel are not able to evaluate. 2.4.2.4.  Acceptance  of  physiological  training  IAW  AFI  11-403  does  not  immediately infer acceptance of centrifuge training program.  The acceptance trips may be combined, but  each  review  functions  separately  to  identify  concurrence  with  USAF  training requirements. 2.5.  Scheduling and Travel Arrangements. 2.5.1.  Details  for  scheduling  acceleration  training  are  found  in  the  AETC  Education  and Training  Course  Announcement  (ETCA).    AFPC  fills  AAT  training  quotas  for  fighter training pipeline aviators. 2.5.2.  Foreign  Military  Sales  training  will  be  scheduled  through  the  respective  country managers,  in  coordination  with  the  scheduling  office  (quota  managers)  at  the  Air  Force Security Assistance Training Squadron, JBSA- Randolph, Texas. AFI11-404  9 JUNE 2017 13 2.5.3.  AFPC/DPAOT  will  reassign  a  Training  Line  Number  for  the  aircrew  member  to attend AAT training.  Travel Orders will be processed by the student’s MPF Formal Training Section.    For  initial  and  retraining,  if  required,  PAT  and  RAT  students  will  be  scheduled directly through USAFSAM/FEEP.  Aircrews are grounded on the 181st day following their first attempt until satisfactory completion of retraining or MAJCOM/A3 or NGB/A3 waiver is approved. 2.6.  Documentation Required to Receive Centrifuge Training  . 2.6.1.  All  students  must  bring  a  current  DD  Form  2992,  AF  Form  1042,  Medical Recommendation  for  Flying  or  Special  Operational  Duty,  or  service/country  equivalent, indicating  individual  is  medically  cleared  by  a  qualified  flight  surgeon  or  aeromedical examiner.    If  students  are  not  medically  cleared  for  flight  or  special  operational  duty,  they will not be allowed to participate in centrifuge training and will be rescheduled before travel. (T-1). 2.7.  Documentation  of  Training.  A  qualified  AOP  officer  assigned  to  centrifuge  operations will document successful completion of centrifuge training. If the AOP officer is not assigned to the centrifuge training facility, AOP officer must obtain written/telephone verification of training from the centrifuge training facility before documenting AF Form 1274. 2.7.1.  AF  Form  4293,  Student  Activity  Record.    This  form  will  be  used  to  document evaluations of AGSM performance.  Students must ensure a copy of the AF Form 4293 goes into their flying training grade book upon return from centrifuge training. 2.7.2.  Documenting  Formal  Centrifuge  Courses.  Use  AF  Form  1274  to  document  training directed  by  this  publication.    A  complete  list  of  course  codes  can  be  found  in  Table  2.1.  Request an example of a completed AF Form 1274 from AETC/A3FM if needed.  Do not use AF Form 1274 to document training required by other AFIs or local requirements. AOPTUs are not required to maintain copies of completed 1274s but are required to maintain a list of names  and  pertinent  information  on  students  who  received  training.      This  list  may  be maintained using Aerospace Physiology Information Management System (APIMS) database or  locally  developed  database  or  spreadsheet.    Successfully  completed  centrifuge  training courses will be updated in Oracle Training Application (OTA), as part of the USAF formal training tracking database. (T-2). 2.7.3.  Documenting  Local  Acceleration Training.  To document local  acceleration training, use  AF  Form  1522  and  the  appropriate  training  codes  obtained  from  aircrew  records management  personnel.    Examples  include  but  are  not  limited  to:  AGSM  refresher,  HUD tape  reviews,  or  other  training.    AOPTUs  are  not  required  to  maintain  copies  of  completed AF  Form  1522  but  are  required  to  maintain  a  list  of  names  and  pertinent  information  on students  who  received  training.    This  list  may  be  maintained  using  APIMS  database  or locally developed database or spreadsheet. (T-2).   14 AFI11-404  9 JUNE 2017 Table 2.1.  AOP Training Task ID codes.

Requirements.  Completion  of  all  training  prescribed  by  this  section  is  required.  Acceleration training academics are required on a recurrent basis by all aircrew and ops support flyers;  centrifuge  training  may  not  be  required  on  a  recurrent  basis  for  aircrew  members  that retain  flying  currency.  All  trainees  are  required  to  present  proof  of  current  USAF  or  service equivalent  flight  physical  (i.e.  DD  Form  2992/AF  Form  1042).    Training  consists  of  the following: 3.2.  Acceleration  Training  Academics.  Fundamental  acceleration  academics  are  provided during pipeline/FTU training; these requirements are established in the appropriate syllabus for each  MDS  and  are  tracked  via  student  gradebooks/databases.    Additionally,  each  MDS  has refresher  training  requirements  for  AGSM;  regular  HUD  tape  reviews  are  accomplished  at  the local  level.  Reference  the  11-2MDS  publication  series  for  information  on  frequency  and authorized trainers. 3.3.  Centrifuge  Academic  Instruction  and  Profiles  .    Platform  academic  instruction  covers the  physiological  effects  of  acceleration  forces,  characteristics  of  GLOC,  techniques  of  an effective  AGSM,  mishap  lessons  learned,  and  protection  offered  by  current  and  future  anti-G systems.    (T-2).    Also,  instructors  will  discuss  the  impact  of  physical  conditioning,  lifestyle, proper nutrition, and situational awareness on individual G-tolerance and on the effectiveness of the AGSM IAW techniques discussed in AFPAM 11-419, G-Awareness for Aircrew. (T-3).  All aircrew will accomplish the training profiles prescribed in the outlines in Attachments 2-5.  (T-2). 3.4.  Grading Criteria  .  The student is expected to demonstrate AGSM skill and proficiency at the  centrifuge  training  facility.  Grading  criteria  is  on  a  pass/fail  basis.    Pass  is  assigned  when student  makes  only  minor  AGSM  performance  errors  that  do  not  impact  overall  AGSM effectiveness.  Fail is assigned when AGSM performance indicates a significant lack of muscular strength,  endurance,  technical  ability,  and/or  knowledge.    Students  who  do  not  successfully complete  the  first  centrifuge  training  session  may  be  retained  for  up  to  3  working  days.    If AGSM performance has not progressed to passing criteria after 3 working days, the student will be assigned a failing grade.  AF Form 4293s will be annotated with this grading and will be used as part of the debrief process for each student. (T-2). 3.5.  Debrief  .  Students will receive a thorough debrief following each training session by the AOP  officer,  with  emphasis  on  improving  each  student’s  AGSM.    The  overall  debrief  will include a review of the aircrew’s digital recording with emphasis on the AGSM, written review of  AGSM  performance  documented  on  AF  Form  4293,  and,  if  warranted,  a  written recommendation  to  the  aircrew  for  a  tailored  conditioning  program  designed  to  increase  the individual’s G-tolerance. (T-2). 3.6.  Non-completion of training: First Attempt Failure. 3.6.1.  Notification.  The AOP officer providing centrifuge training will notify the aircrew's squadron commander in writing/electronic mail of the failure and provide the commander a copy of the aircrew's training report and recommendations for improvement.  AFPC/DPAOT 16 AFI11-404  9 JUNE 2017 must be notified within 24 hours of all AAT and F-15E CSO failures. AFSAT/DO must be notified within 24 hours of all International student failures. (T-1). Schedule retraining within 60-180 days following first attempt failure. 3.6.2.  Grounding.    Aircrew  members  are  not  medically  grounded  following  a  failed  first attempt beyond the recommendation to not fly as an aircrew member for 12-hours following centrifuge training. 3.6.3.  Restrictions.    There  is  no  automatic  restriction  following  first-attempt  failure.    The squadron commander may opt to restrict aircrew from solo high-G operations until successful completion  of  centrifuge  retraining  if  desired  after  review  of  the  centrifuge  training  record and  consultation  with  the  flight  surgeon  and  an  AOP  officer  currently  assigned  to  the centrifuge.    Operations  Group  commanders  determine  disposition  of  nonrated  aircrew, operations  support  flyers,  or  any  other  individuals  assigned  aeronautical  orders  sent  to centrifuge training IAW par 2.2 after their first attempt failure.   The  student’s  commander  or  commander-designated 3.6.4.  Conditioning  program. representative  will  monitor  the  aircrew's  progress  in  any  physical  conditioning  program.  Aircrew  must  be  afforded  sufficient  opportunity  to  work  on  their  individual  conditioning program  IAW  AF  fitness  guidance.    Students  should  seek  out  local  exercise  physiology expertise from a Fighter Aircrew Conditioning Program (FACP) Instructor (see para 4.5.2) if physical  conditioning  was  recognized  as  a  weakness  during  acceleration  training.    The commander  and  flight  surgeon  will  review  the  aircrew’s  progress  in  the  conditioning program before scheduling retraining. 3.6.5.  Second Attempt Training.  A second attempt will be scheduled no earlier than 60 days following the student’s first attempt failure. (T-3).  This program is 1-3 days in duration and consists of the following: 3.6.5.1.  Review of digital recording and training report from the first training attempt. 3.6.5.2.  Review of progress made during individual conditioning program. 3.6.5.3.  Academics tailored to the individual's original problem areas. 3.6.5.4.  At  a  minimum,  practical  G-training  profiles  as  described  in  attachments  2 through 5.  Students must successfully perform all profile training during repeat training attempts, regardless of pass status of some runs during first training session.            Note: Aerospace Medicine Primary and Aerospace and Operational Physiology Officer course students  may  be  considered  for  second  attempt  within  60  days  when  training  is accomplished at the Wright-Patterson AFB centrifuge. 3.7.  Non-completion of training: Second Attempt Failure. 3.7.1.  Notification.  The AOP officer providing centrifuge training will notify the aircrew's commander  in  writing/email  and  provide  an  information  copy  to  AETC/A3FM  of  the aircrew's failure to complete retraining.  Notification must include the reasons for the failure and should include any recommendations that might be beneficial in determining the future training ability of the aircrew.  In addition, AFPC/DPAOT must be notified within 24 hours of  all  AAT  and  F-15E  CSO  failures.  AFSAT/DO  must  be  notified  within  24  hours  of  all International student failures. (T-1). AFI11-404  9 JUNE 2017 17 3.7.2.  Grounding  and  medical  evaluation.    Aircrew  members  are  medically  grounded pending completion of a medical evaluation by a qualified flight surgeon.  The flight surgeon will  determination  if  there  is  any  underlying  pathology  that  caused  or  contributed  to  the failure to complete training.  The flight surgeon will provide the results of this evaluation to the  unit  commander  and  the  MAJCOM/SGP  or  equivalent.    Following  satisfactory completion  of  treatment  (if  underlying  pathology  is  a  factor),  recommendation  by  the attending  flight surgeon, and  concurrence by the MAJCOM/SGP  or equivalent,  the  aircrew may  reattempt  without  prejudice.    If  no  underlying  pathology  was  discovered,  then  the remaining procedures in this section will be implemented. 3.7.3.  Aircrew  Disposition.    Aircrew  who  have  failed  a  second  attempt  will  undergo  an Operational Review to determine their final disposition. (T-3). 3.7.3.1.  The  aircrew's  operations  group  commander  or  equivalent  will  conduct  a  unit-level operational review.  The purpose of this review is to provide a recommendation to the MAJCOM/A3 or equivalent as to whether a qualified aircrew member should receive a  waiver  to  continue  in  their  weapon  system.    The  operations  group  commander  must consider  the  aircrew's  flying  skill  and  experience,  and  then  determine  the  aircrew's potential to develop into a successful high-G aviator. 3.7.3.2.  UPT students that fail a second attempt will be reviewed by owning MAJCOM for disposition. (T-1). 18 AFI11-404  9 JUNE 2017 Chapter 4 FIGHTER AIRCREW CONDITIONING PROGRAM 4.1.  Overview Description and Goals. 4.1.1.  Description  and  Goals.    There  is  overwhelming  evidence  that  physical  fitness  is important  for  optimizing  flying  performance  in  high-G  aircraft.    Specifically,  anaerobic capacity  and  endurance  play  an  important  part  in  executing  an  effective  AGSM.    Several other  elements  also  play  a  role  in  G-performance,  creating  the  need  for  a  comprehensive training  program  that  covers  all  elements.    FACP  implements  targeted  fitness  early  in  the undergraduate pipeline with an emphasis on high-G fitness as part of foundational education to enable lifelong G tolerance.  FACP adds scheduled high-G fitness education to all AETC Undergraduate  Flying  Training  (UFT),  Introduction  to  Fighter  Fundamentals  (IFF),  and fighter Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and Formal Training Unit (FTU) courses. FACP may be  implemented  throughout  the  aircrew  member’s  career,  with  special  consideration  when returning to high-G environment after time off. 4.1.2.  The goal of the FACP is to improve the high-G fitness and execution of the AGSM for fighter aircrew members and establish effective physical conditioning habits for all aircrew. Conditioning should be specific to the duration and demands of the high-G environment. 4.1.3.  The program consists of formal education as part of UFT, IFF, PIT, and FTU courses.  The  education  phase  is  designed  to  educate  aircrews  on  the  components  of  fitness  that  are most important for improving AGSM performance. UFT students will complete an observed self-assessment by FACP instructors.  The education may be used in formal G Continuation Training for follow-on aircraft. 4.2.  Scheduling and Participating in Fitness Training. 4.2.1.  UFT  students  must  receive  FACP  Education  during  the  preflight  phase.    Students  in Type 1 aircraft will continue to participate in FACP throughout the duration of UFT. (T-3). 4.2.2.  All  students  in  T-6/T-38  PIT,  IFF,  and  fighter  FTU,  FTU  upgrading  instructor  pilot (UIP),  and  transition/retraining  must  participate  in  FACP  education.  Self-assessments  are only required for UFT students.  Students who are reassigned to Type 2 aircraft following a non-flying assignment or who are converting from a Type 1 aircraft will also receive FACP education during transition training, including senior officers (O-6 and above). (T-3). 4.2.3.  For  joint  service  and  international  students  in  Air  Force  training  programs, participation in FACP is highly encouraged. 4.3.  Education Phase. 4.3.1.  Classroom Academics. 4.3.1.1.  High-G  Fitness  Academics.    FACP  instructors  will  provide  the  knowledge  to execute  an  effective  fitness  and  conditioning  program  throughout  the  student’s  flying career to enhance their physical performance in the high-G environment. (T-3). 4.3.1.1.1.  Fitness  for  G-performance  requires  several  fitness  elements  including anaerobic  (muscle  strength  and  endurance)  fitness,  aerobic  fitness,  flexibility,  and AFI11-404  9 JUNE 2017 19 balance/stability.    Additionally,  neck  stretching  and  strengthening  as  well  as  injury mitigation strategies will be part of this comprehensive approach.  Safety and proper form will be emphasized for all exercises. 4.3.1.1.2.  Anaerobic  fitness  is  essential  to  performing  an  effective  AGSM  while minimizing  muscular  fatigue.  In  particular,  core  (abdominal  and  lower  back)  and lower  body  muscle  (glutes  and  legs)  tensing  is  critical  to  prevent  G-related  blood pooling  and  loss  of  blood  pressure  to  the  brain.    Exercises  that  build  strength  and endurance for those muscle groups will be a major focus of the FACP.  The principles of warm-up, split  training  and periodicity (cycling of weight/reps/sets) should  be an integral part of FACP education. 4.3.1.1.3.  Aerobic  fitness  (cardiovascular  efficiency)  increases  blood  supply  to  the working  muscles  which  significantly  reduces  recovery  time  between  engagements and  sorties.  Aerobic  conditioning  should  be  carefully  matched  to  duration  and intensity  of  the  high-G  environment.  Higher  intensity/shorter  duration  aerobic training  should  be  emphasized  as  most  appropriate  for  preparing  students  for  the high-G  environment.    Lower  intensity/longer  duration  aerobic  training  is  also appropriate for long-term health. 4.3.1.1.4.  Other  Training  Aspects.    Flexibility  refers  to  the  degree  to  which  a  joint moves through a normal, pain-free range of motion.  Flexibility may contribute to a successful AGSM and help reduce the risk for injuries.  Decreased flexibility, on the other  hand,  may  reduce  physical  performance  and  increase  injury  risk  during  flight maneuvers.  Core  strength  may  be  improved  by  exercising  muscles  deep  within  the abdomen  and  back  attaching  to  the  spine  or  pelvis.    Many  movements  originate  at these muscles and form the source of an individual’s stability.  Training for stability involves training the body as a whole versus separate muscle groups.  Exercises that improve core strength may contribute to a better AGSM and prevent short and long-term injuries that tend to result from the demands of high-G sorties.  Core exercises may  be  accomplished  while  seated  on  stable  or  unstable  devices  and  adding  lateral, posterior,  and  anterior  forces  to  simulate  acceleration  forces.  Finally,  FACP instructors  will  provide  students  with  the  knowledge  necessary  to  reduce  or  prevent neck injuries through proper stretching and strengthening. 4.3.1.2.  Exercise.    FACP  observers  or  instructors  will  demonstrate  proper  fitness techniques  and  specific  exercises  the  student  can  perform  to  optimize  high-G  physical performance.    FACP  instructors  will  offer  students  variations  of  exercises  for  each applicable muscle area. (T-3). 4.3.1.3.  Observed  Self-Assessments.  FACP  observers  or  instructors  will  oversee students’ self-assessments as they complete the demonstrated exercises. In the absence of validated  research  on  which  exercise  activities  improve  G  performance,  the  selected exercises  listed  in  AETC  FACP  courseware  were  included  for  their  demonstrated improvement  in  affected  muscle  groups.    Instructors  will  focus  on  individualized recommendations to improve student fitness.  An acceptable FACP assessment  does not guarantee acceptable performance in the G environment. High-G aircrews must consider the  wide  range  of  personal  physiological  factors  and  apply  sound  judgment  in determining personal capabilities on any given day or sortie. (T-3). 20 AFI11-404  9 JUNE 2017 4.3.1.4.  Instructors  may  incorporate  AF  Fitness  Assessment  results  as  part  of  the individualized recommendations, if appropriate. 4.3.1.5.  To reduce the risk for injuries, FACP instructors will emphasize the need for a quality warm-up before the exercise. 4.4.  Documentation. 4.4.1.  The student's FACP participation during UFT will be tracked as part of physiological training completion in the appropriate student tracking database, such as GTIMS.  (T-3). 4.4.2.  Individual  Counseling.    FACP  instructors  who  determine  that  a  student  needs additional fitness monitoring (based on HUD tape reviews, or inadequate G-performance in the  aircraft)  may  counsel  and  schedule  students  for  additional  observed  fitness  self-assessments. 4.5.  FACP Roles, Qualification and Training.  The FACP Observer, Instructor and Instructor Trainer provide the team to ensure the proper physical training is taught and conducted in order to prepare for high-G aircraft maneuvers. Courses listed in paragraph 4.5.2. provide the skills and knowledge  for  Instructors  to  provide  exercise  education  and  assessment.    Courses  completed before  assignment  as  a  FACP  Instructor  may  be  used  to  satisfy  the  required  training  for  that position.  Supervisors  should  evaluate  training  recency  during  their  assessment  of  Instructor cadre. 4.5.1.  FACP Observer:  The Observer is  the starting point for personnel  to  become familiar with  the  FACP  program  and  exercise  technique.    FACP  Observers  will  complete  Physical Training  Leader  (PTL)  course  where  available  and  maintain  Heart  Saver  BLS  certification.  Their  role  is  to  watch  and  record  FACP  self-assessments.  FACP  observers  demonstrate proper fitness techniques and specific exercises the student can perform to optimize high-G physical performance. 4.5.2.  FACP  Instructors  will  maintain  Heart  Saver  BLS  certification.  FACP  Instructor training  consists  of  at  least  one  of  the  following:  National  Strength  and  Conditioning Association’s  Certified  Strength  and  Conditioning  Specialist  Course,  American  College  of Sports  Medicine’s  Certified  Health  Fitness  Specialist  Course  or  AETC  Exercise  Principles for G course (delivered by a certified Instructor Trainer).  The AETC Exercise Principles for G  course  provides  a  broad  review  of  exercise  physiology  and  introduces  the  exercises  that can  be  used  as  part  of  the  baseline  assessment  for  pilots  entering  sustained  high-G  aircraft training.  FACP  Instructors will meet  the observer criteria, maintain  an academic evaluation by  a  certified  Instructor  Trainer,  and  attend  any  instructor  continuing  education  sessions scheduled by the local Instructor Trainer. 4.5.3.  Instructor Trainer.  Certified instructors who have demonstrated mastery of the basic skills necessary may complete additional training to serve as an instructor trainer.  Instructor trainers  ensure  training  standardization  and  enough  basic  instructors  to  effectively  observe student self-assessments. 4.5.3.1.  Academic Degree Criteria. A specific academic degree is  not  a prerequisite for instructor  trainer  designation.    Non-degreed  instructors  must  complete  minimum  of  six semester  hours  of  relevant  college  education  courses.    (T-3).    Relevant  courses  include fitness,  exercise  science,  acceleration  physiology,  fitness  evaluation  strategies, AFI11-404  9 JUNE 2017 21 performance  measurement  tools,  exercise  facilitator/personal  trainer,  and  other  courses that enhance the instructor’s subject knowledge in exercise principles for G and teaching abilities. 4.5.3.2.  Instructional  Skills  Assessment.    Instructor  trainers  will  evaluate  FACP Instructor’s presentation  delivery, academic counseling, and other skills required for the FACP.  The supervisor will use the assessment to determine if any additional training or experience is necessary. The supervisor will document the assessment as part of the local instructor assessment program. (T-3). 22 AFI11-404  9 JUNE 2017 Chapter 5 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND DEVICE MANAGEMENT 5.1.

G-Awareness  Training—A comprehensive program ensures optimum G-awareness training of HGA aircrew.  The program consists of physiological and operational training on G-awareness, centrifuge  training,  and  an  ongoing  continuation  training  program.    This  instruction  addresses only  the  centrifuge  training  portion  of  the  G  Awareness  Program.    For  information  regarding continuation training, please see appropriate MDS AFIs. High-G Aircraft (HGA)—HGA are aircraft capable of generating a G-loading in excess of 6.0 G.  This definition is further divided into the following two categories: Type  1  Aircraft—Aircraft  capable  of  rapid  G-onset  rates  greater  than  6.0  G/sec,  but  are typically not employed above 7.5 G.  Current US military aircraft which meet this definition are the A/O/A-10, T/AT-38, AV-8, F-4, F-15E, F-35 and F/A-18. Type  2  Aircraft—Aircraft capable of  rapid  G-onset  rates  greater than 6.0 G/sec and sustained G-loading greater than 5 seconds above 7.5 G.  Examples of USAF military aircraft meeting this definition are the F-15 C/D, F-16, and F-22A. 26 AFI11-404  9 JUNE 2017 Active Type 1 and 2 personnel—Any pilot, CSO, flight surgeon, AOP personnel, student pilot in  the  fighter  pipeline,  other  rated/nonrated  aircrew,  operational  support  flyer,  or  any  other individuals  assigned  aeronautical  orders  assigned  to  an  active  flying  billet  or  performing unrestricted flight in a Type 2.  AFI11-404  9 JUNE 2017 27 Attachment 2 PRIMARY ACCELERATION TRAINING A2.1.  Primary  Acceleration  Training  (PAT)  Overview.  PAT  prepares  aircrew  for  Type  1 high-G  flight.    PAT  is  conducted  between  the  primary  (T-6)  and  advanced  (T-38)  phases  in Specialized  Undergraduate  Pilot  Training  (SUPT)  and  Euro-NATO  Joint  Jet  Pilot  Training (ENJJPT)  for  pipeline  student  pilots.    Students  must  successfully  complete  PAT  before  flying solo in the T-38, unless approved for solo flight by the flying squadron commander following a first attempt failure, with the recommendation of a centrifuge qualified AOP officer.  Pipeline F-15E  CSOs  will  receive  this  training  after  completion  of  CSO  training  and  before  first  flight  of Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF).  Successful completion of PAT is a prerequisite for entry  into  the  A-10,  F-15E  and  F-35  formal  training  unit  (FTU)  courses.    Additionally,  pilots reporting to Type 1 training outside of SUPT/CSO pipeline need to complete PAT training (e.g. C-17 pilot enrolled in Test Pilot School who will fly T-38 in TPS). A2.2.  Centrifuge  Profiles.  Completion  of  all  centrifuge  profiles  prescribed  by  this  section  is required.    All  aircrew  will  train  in  the  13-degree  upright  seat  and  center  stick  configuration.  Aircrew will train in the G-suit garment appropriate to their aircraft. A2.2.1.  First  profile.  Gradual  on-set  (0.1 G/s) run to  peripheral  vision loss  (approximately 60  degrees  vision  loss).    The  purpose  of  this  profile  is  to  familiarize  the  aircrew  with  G-induced  vision  loss  in  a  controlled  environment,  and  to  determine  the  aircrew’s  resting  G-tolerance  for  the  training  day.    The  anti-G  suit  will  be  worn  but  not  inflated  during  this profile. A2.2.2.  Second  profile.    Rapid  on-set  (6.0  G/second)  run  to  4.0  G  for  15  seconds.    The purpose of this profile is to practice a proper AGSM.  The anti-G suit will be on for this and all subsequent runs. A2.2.3.  Third  profile.    Rapid  on-set  (6.0  G/second)  run  to  5.0  G  for  30  seconds.    The purpose of this profile is to practice a proper AGSM. A2.2.4.  Fourth  profile.    Rapid  on-set  (6.0  G/second)  run  to  7.5  G  for  15  seconds.    The purpose of this profile is to establish aircrew confidence in their ability to operate in the high-G environment. A2.2.5.  Fifth profile.  Simulated Air Combat Maneuver (SACM) (6.0 G/second); the aircrew tracks a target through a series of maneuvers at a minimum of 3.0 G and a maximum of 7.0 G.  Automatic target tracking profile will be used for all rear cockpit trainees.  The purpose of this profile is to perform the AGSM in a dynamic environment while fatigued. 28 AFI11-404  9 JUNE 2017 Figure A2.1.

AAT  is  designed  to  illustrate differences  in  Type  1  and  Type  2  flight.    Previously  PAT  qualified  aircrews  selected  for,  or transitioning  to  Type  2,  aircraft  are  required  to  attend.    Successful  completion  of  AAT  is  a prerequisite for entry into the Type 2, FTU courses.  AAT may be completed upon selection to Type 2 aircraft but must be successfully completed before first flight at FTU. A3.2.  Centrifuge  Profiles.  Completion  of  all  centrifuge  profiles  prescribed  by  this  section  is required.  F-16 candidates will train in the 30-degree reclined seat.  All other aircrew will train in the 13-degree upright seat.  The maximum G identified in each profile will be adjusted for MDS specific  requirements.    Aircrew  will  train  in  the  G-suit  garment  appropriate  to  their  aircraft.  AETC/A3FM will be the approving authority for any deviations in G-suit wear.(T-2). A3.2.1.  First  profile.  Gradual  on-set  (0.1 G/s) run to  peripheral  vision loss  (approximately 60  degrees  vision  loss).    The  purpose  of  this  profile  is  to  familiarize  the  aircrew  with  G-induced  vision  loss  in  a  controlled  environment,  and  to  determine  the  aircrew’s  resting  G-tolerance  for  the  training  day.    The  anti-G  suit  will  be  worn  but  not  inflated  during  this profile. A3.2.2.  Second  profile.    Rapid  on-set  (6.0  G/second)  run  to  6.0  G  for  30  seconds.    The purpose of this run is to practice a proper AGSM at reduced G-levels.  The anti-G suit is on for this and all subsequent profiles. A3.2.3.  Third profile.  Rapid on-set (6.0 G/second) run to 8.5 G for F-15 C/D, 9.0 G for F-16,  and  F/A-22  for  15  seconds.    The  purpose  of  this  profile  is  to  establish  a  proper performance of the AGSM at the G-level prescribed for the MDS. A3.2.4.  Fourth profile.  Rapid on-set (6.0 G/second) run to 7.0 G for F-16, and F/A-22 and 6.0  G  for  all  other  MDS  for  10  seconds.    This  profile  will  be  completed  in  the  ‘Check  6’ position. A3.2.5.  Fifth profile.  SACM (6.0 G/second).  The aircrew tracks a target through a series of maneuvers  at  a  minimum  of  3.0  G  and  maximum  G  tailored  to  the  capabilities  of  the aircrew’s  gaining  aircraft,  i.e.,  9.0  G  for  F-16,  and  F/A-22  and  8.0  G  for  F-15  C/D.    An automatic target-tracking profile will be used for all rear cockpit aircrew.  The purpose of this profile  is  to  evaluate  AGSM  performance  and  G/AGSM  situational  awareness  while physically fatigued and procedurally tasked. 30 AFI11-404  9 JUNE 2017 Figure A3.1.

Refresher  Acceleration  Training  (RAT)  Overview.  RAT  is  designed  for  previously AAT  qualified  aircrews  who  are  returning  to  Type  2  aircraft  after  greater  than  39  months  in  a non-flying  billet.    Aircrew  previously  centrifuge  qualified  at  7.5G  or  above  have  solid foundations in G-awareness, flight discipline and risk management for the employment envelope and do not require refresher training if returning to the A-10, T-38, F-15E and F-35 aircraft after any duration. A4.2.  Centrifuge  Profiles.  Completion  of  all  centrifuge  profiles  prescribed  by  this  section  is required.  F-16 candidates will train in the 30-degree reclined seat.  All other aircrew will train in the 13-degree upright seat.  The maximum G identified in each profile will be adjusted for MDS specific  requirements.    All  profiles  will  be  digitally  recorded.    Aircrew  will  train  in  the  G-suit garment  appropriate  to  their  aircraft.    AETC/A3FM  will  be  the  approving  authority  for  any deviations  in  G-suit  wear.    Aircrew  have  the  option  of  performing  centrifuge  profiles  with COMBAT EDGE as appropriate to their aircraft.  (T-2). A4.2.1.  First  profile.  Gradual  on-set  (0.1 G/s) run to  peripheral  vision loss  (approximately 60  degrees  vision  loss).    The  purpose  of  this  profile  is  to  familiarize  the  aircrew  with  G-induced  vision  loss  in  a  controlled  environment,  and  to  determine  the  aircrew’s  resting  G-tolerance  for  the  training  day.    The  anti-G  suit  will  be  worn  but  not  inflated  during  this profile. A4.2.2.  Second profile.  Rapid on-set (6.0 G/second) run to 6.0 G for 10 seconds.

Commander-Directed Acceleration Training (CDAT) Overview.  CDAT is a tool used by  an  organizational  commander  to  evaluate  /improve  an  aircrew’s  performance  or  confidence under G.  Any aircrew member may return at the discretion of his or her commander following in-flight  G  related  issues  or  when  an  aircrew  member’s  AGSM  needs  improvement.  Commanders will use the evaluation from the CDAT outcome to direct follow-on training. A5.2.  Training  Overview.  A  centrifuge  qualified  AOP  officer  will  conduct  the  training program.    This  program  is  2-3  days  in  duration  depending  on  the  student’s  technique  and progress  throughout  training.    Each  student  will  receive  a  maximum  of  2  training  sessions  per day and the program will consist of the following: (T-2). A5.2.1.  Analysis and review of individual AGSM performance in the centrifuge. A5.2.2.  Centrifuge training profiles tailored to the individual’s needs.  The purpose of these profiles is to work on the aircrew’s specific problem areas.  This may include training with COMBAT EDGE equipment. A5.3.  Evaluation  Criteria.  Training  will  be  complete  when  student  demonstrates  continued AGSM proficiency.  The centrifuge qualified AOP officer’s recommendation will be made to the student’s commander reporting the student’s ability to mitigate physiological effects for the level of G required by their aircraft.
