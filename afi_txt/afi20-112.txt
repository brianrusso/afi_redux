Evaluators must pass three Evaluator Proficiency Evaluations (EPE) within 120 days of appointment (the first EPE will be accomplished within 40 days).  EPEs will be conducted by a qualified evaluator to ensure the member can execute the proper steps to conduct  an  evaluation.    Each quality  evaluator,  must pass  the EPEs prior to  performing 8 AFI20-112  6 OCTOBER 2017 unsupervised evaluations and inspections.  ARC evaluators must accomplish  mandatory training  and  pass  three  EPEs  within  210  days  of  appointment  (the  first  EPE  will  be accomplished within 90 days).  (T-2). 3.3.1.4.  Create a Master Training Plan in the Training Business Area using LR QA Air Force  Job  Qualification  Standard  (AFJQS)  and  document  QAE  training  in  individual training  plans.    Document  civilian  training  on  AF  Form  971,  Supervisor's  Employee Brief.  (T-2). 3.4.  Assessment  Methodology.  Assessments are the formal avenue to ensure the effectiveness of logistics procedures and identify areas for improvement.  They provide leadership with factual information about the health and effectiveness of the unit and training.  Accurate assessments of personnel  proficiency  and  processes  are  critical  to  gauging  unit  effectiveness.    This  program enhances  cross-tell  and  facilitates  benchmarking,  while  allowing  latitude  to  adapt  it  for  local needs.    QAE  assessments  will  be  conducted  through  the  use  of  evaluations,  inspections,  and observations. (T-2). 3.4.1.  Evaluations.    Represent  the  direct  evaluation  of  a  logistics  action,  inspection,  or training  conducted/performed  by  an  individual  or  team.    Evaluations  are  used  to  assess  job proficiency,  degree  of  training,  and  compliance  with  technical  data  or  instructions.    Any individual  performing,  supervising,  or  evaluating  logistics  tasks  is  subject  to  a  direct evaluation.  Evaluations include: 3.4.1.1.  Personnel  Evaluations  (PE).    A  PE  is  the  direct  evaluation  of  an  individual  or team  conducting/performing  a  logistics  action.    PEs  may  be  conducted  on  task-oriented functions  such  as  equipment  maintenance  as  well  as  process-oriented  functions  such  as vehicle dispatch. 3.4.1.2.  Evaluator Proficiency Evaluation (EPE).  An EPE is the direct evaluation of QA or any individual performing a quality/compliance assurance function in a unit. 3.4.1.3.  Trainer Proficiency Evaluations (TPE).  A TPE is the direct evaluation of a unit instructor/trainer or certifier to determine their ability to teach accurately and sufficiently.  TPEs  also  assess  weapon  system,  equipment  or  process  knowledge;  teaching  methods and techniques; the ability to operate trainers; and adequacy and effectiveness of training programs.  Any individual training or certifying personnel on a task or process is subject to a TPE. 3.4.2.  Inspections.  Defined  as  the  inspection  of  equipment,  to  ensure  compliance  with established standards.  Inspections are rated as Pass/Fail.  Inspections include: 3.4.2.1.  Quality  Verification  Inspection  (QVI).    A  QVI  is  an  inspection  of  equipment condition  or  a  process  after  an  inspection,  repair  action  or  process  that  has  been completed by a technician or supervisor to assess if it was properly completed.  The QVI finding  should  reflect  deficiencies  by  the  individual  who  accomplished  the  task  and identify specific discrepancies.    AFI20-112  6 OCTOBER 2017 9 3.4.2.2.  Special Inspections (SI).  SIs are inspections not covered by QVIs or Evaluations and  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  inspections  of:  equipment  forms,  document control  procedures  and  file  plans,  inventory  controls,  Technical  Order  (T.O.)  files, vehicle inspections, housekeeping, safety practices, and other interest items identified by Headquarters Air Force and MAJCOMs.  SIs may be compliance or proficiency oriented. 3.4.3.  Observations.  Defined as the observed events or conditions with safety implications or technical  violations not  related to  an evaluation  or inspection that are considered unsafe, not in accordance with established procedures, or in the case of equipment, unfit to operate. Observations include: 3.4.3.1.  Detected  Safety  Violation  (DSV).    A  DSV  is  an  observed  unsafe  act  by  an individual.  The QAE must stop  the unsafe act immediately  (T-0).  Do  not  document  a separate  DSV  on  an  individual  undergoing  a  direct  evaluation  since  the  unsafe  act automatically results in a “Fail” rating.  Annotate the failure with “Safety” when a safety violation is committed during an evaluation.  Report all safety incidents to the  squadron safety representative IAW local safety policy. 3.4.3.2.  Technical  Data  Violation  (TDV).    A  TDV  is  an  observation  of  any  person performing  maintenance  or  another  logistics  process  inconsistent,  contradictory  or without the required technical data present at the job site when mandatory use is required.  The  technician  must  have  knowledge  of  all  general  directives  associated  with  the  job prior to  performing the task.  (T-1).  Do not  document a separate TDV on an individual undergoing a direct evaluation since failure to use technical data automatically results in a “Fail” rating.  Annotate the failure with “Tech Data” when a TDV is committed during an evaluation. 3.4.3.3.  Unsatisfactory Condition Report (UCR).  A UCR is an unsafe or unsatisfactory condition,  other  than  a  DSV,  chargeable  to  the  work  center  supervisor.    UCRs  will  be documented even when it is not possible to determine who created the condition. (T-1). 3.5.  Acceptable Quality Levels (AQLs).  An AQL denotes the maximum allowable number of minor findings that a process or product may be charged for the task to be rated “Pass.”  It must be strict enough that the task, process or product meets an acceptable level of quality, and is not so  strict  that  a  pass  rating  is  unattainable.    Task  issuing  authorities  (e.g.,  HAF,  MAJCOM, LR/CC) establish/approve AQLs. Discrepancy codes are IAW AFI 90-201, Air Force Inspection System. 3.6.  Key  Task  List  (KTL).  The  KTL  is  a  HAF,  MAJCOM  or  unit  developed  list  of  required inspections.    The  KTL  is  designed  to  cover  tasks  that  are  complex  and  those  affecting  critical logistics  processes,  nuclear  surety  and/or  safety  as  designated  by  leadership.    All  logistics actions/functions  listed  on  the  KTL  require  mandatory  call-in  to  QA  each  time  the  logistics action/function is accomplished.  QAE will respond and perform an inspection (T-3).  The QAE must  review  and  update  unit  KTLs  as  required  to  ensure  they  encompass  those  logistics actions/functions directly affecting quality of complex critical logistics processes.  (T-1).   10 AFI20-112  6 OCTOBER 2017 3.7.  Routine  Inspection  List  (RIL).  The  RIL  is  a  HAF,  MAJCOM  or  unit  developed  list  of routine  inspections  that  must  be  performed  with  an  identified  frequency.    The  QAE  shall consolidate  inputs  provided  by  flight  leadership  for  suggested  RIL  items/frequency  and  obtain LR/CC approval.  Tasks shall not be removed from the RIL without issuing authorities' approval (e.g. HAF, MAJCOM, LR/CC).  (T-1). 3.8.  Assessment Finding Procedures. 3.8.1.  The QAE will notify the LR/CC immediately of all major findings or failures related to  safety,  security,  or  nuclear  surety.    (T-1).    Additionally,  the  QAE  will  suspense evaluations/inspections  receiving  a  fail,  DSV,  TDV,  or  UCR  to  the  appropriate  flight commander/NCOIC for corrective action(s).  (T-1). 3.8.2.  Work centers will provide a corrective action plan to all findings by the 10th duty day, stating the action taken to resolve the identified problem(s) to include an implementation date or estimated completion date.  Root cause analysis will be conducted by the evaluated work center for all major findings to determine underlying causes and appropriate corrective action (T-2).    The  LR  quality  evaluators  may  assist  with  conducting  root  cause  analysis.    Unit commanders will be briefed on open/closed items. (T-2).  ARC units will submit replies by the end of the next scheduled Unit Training Assembly/Regularly Scheduled Drill. (T-2). 3.8.3.  Evaluators will provide the following: 3.8.3.1.  Introductory  and  post-evaluation  feedback  to  personnel,  as  appropriate  to  the evaluation. (T-1). 3.8.3.2.  Offer  guidance/suggestions  as  needed  during  the  post-evaluation  feedback session. (T-1). 3.8.3.3.  Tracking number assigned to each evaluation within LEAP. (T-1). 3.8.3.4.  Use Specialty Training Standard to evaluate authorized areas. (T-1). 3.8.3.5.  Maintain  all specialty training, i.e., Hazardous Materials, Joint Inspections, etc.  (T-1). 3.8.3.6.  Review  all  individuals’  records,  where  applicable,  for  those  evaluations receiving a fail, DSV or TDV to verify training documentation. (T-1). 3.8.3.7.  Identify  discrepancies  in  documentation  to  the  individual’s  supervisor  with follow-up  action  to  the  unit  training  manager.  (T-1).    At  no  time  will  the  evaluation ratings be changed based on OJT Record documentation discrepancies alone. 3.8.4.  Findings are validated deficiencies and will be tracked at the unit level until resolved.  The following are the two types of findings: 3.8.4.1.  Major  Finding.    A  deficiency  that  results  or  could  result  in  widespread  or significant mission impact or failure. 3.8.4.2.  Minor Finding.  A deficiency that is procedurally incorrect, but only has minor mission impact.  AFI20-112  6 OCTOBER 2017 11 3.8.4.3.  All  findings  (e.g.,  failed  evaluation/inspection  or  observation)  will  include  a reference  to  the  TO,  instruction,  and/or  command  standard  individually  violated.    QAE will  review  results  with  the  individual(s)  and  supervisor  upon  completion  of  each evaluation.  (T-1).  JOHN B.

The QVI finding should reflect deficiencies by the individual who accomplished the task and identify specific discrepancies. Routine Inspection List (RIL)— The RIL is a HAF, MAJCOM or unit developed list of routine inspections  that  must  be  performed  with  an  identified  frequency.    The  QA  Section  shall consolidate  inputs  provided  by  flight  leadership  for  suggested  RIL  items/frequency  and  obtain LRS/CC  approval.    Tasks  shall  not  be  removed  from  the  RIL  without  issuing  authorities' approval (e.g., AF, MAJCOM, LRS/CC). Special  Inspections  (SI)—  SIs  are  inspections  not  covered  by  QVIs  or  Evaluations  and  may include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  inspections  of:  equipment  forms,  document  control  procedures and  file  plans, inspections, housekeeping, safety practices, and other interest items identified by Headquarters Air Force and MAJCOMs.  SIs may be compliance or proficiency oriented. inventory  controls,  Technical  Order  (T.O.)  files,  vehicle Technical  Data  Violation  (TDV)—  A  TDV  is  an  observation  of  any  person  performing maintenance  or  another  logistics  process  inconsistent,  contradictory  or  without  the  required technical data present at the job site when mandatory use is required.  The technician must have knowledge of all general directives associated with the job prior to performing the task.  Do not document  a  separate  TDV  on  an  individual  undergoing  a  direct  evaluation  since  failure  to  use technical  data  automatically  results  in  a  “Fail”  rating.    Annotate  the  failure  with  “Tech  Data” when a TDV is committed during an evaluation. Trainer  Proficiency  Evaluations  (TPE)— The  direct  evaluation  of  a unit instructor/trainer to determine  their  ability  to  teach  accurately  and  sufficiently.    TPEs  also  assess  weapon  system, equipment  or  process  knowledge;  teaching  methods  and  techniques;  the  ability  to  operate AFI20-112  6 OCTOBER 2017 15 trainers; and adequacy and effectiveness of training programs.  Any individual training personnel on a task or process is subject to a TPE. Unsatisfactory Condition Report (UCR)— An unsafe or unsatisfactory condition, other than a DSV, chargeable to the work center supervisor.  16 AFI20-112  6 OCTOBER 2017 Attachment 2 LOGISTICS READINESS FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS Table A2.1.
