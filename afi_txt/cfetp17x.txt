This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training, training support resources and initial qualification requirements for the Cyberspace Operations officer career field.  These initial and follow-on requirements were developed to educate and train the Cyberspace Operators, provide a career path to success and document all aspects of career field training. 2. The CFETP consists of two parts; both parts of the plan are used by officers, supervisors and commanders to plan, organize, lead, and control training within the Cyberspace Operations career field. 2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A provides general information about the CFETP; Section B identifies duties and responsibilities, career field progression information, training decisions and career field path; Section C associates each Air Force Specialty (AFS) skill level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education and training); and Section D addresses resource constraints. 2.2. Part II shows options available to meet an officer’s education and training needs.  Section A identifies the training students receive in a specific course.  Section B identifies training courses including mandatory AF in-residence, field, exportable and online courses.  Section C and Section D are reserved at this time. 3.  This CFETP serves as the foundational document that will ensure individuals in the Cyberspace Operations Officer specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career.  This plan will enable those in the Cyberspace Operations career field to train today’s 17X officers to a variety of opportunities across the spectrum of cyberspace operations. NOTE:  Civilians occupying equivalent positions may use the Specialty Training Standard in Part II Section B for their duty position qualification training.   4 Abbreviations/Terms Explained Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL).  Evolution of distributed learning (distance learning) that emphasizes collaboration on standards-based versions of reusable objects, networks, and learning management systems, yet may include some legacy methods and media.  ADL leverages the full power of computers, information, and communication technologies through the use of common standards in order to provide synchronous or asynchronous learning that can be tailored to individual needs and delivered anywhere-anytime.  ADL also includes establishing an interoperable “computer managed instruction” environment that supports the needs of developers, learners, instructors, administrators, managers, and family.  ADL encompasses all the methodologies mentioned above, and in addition, includes ongoing and expected improvements in learning methods. Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM).

Weapon Systems:  The Air Force has seven weapon systems in our inventory.  Six of the seven have unclassified descriptions and are briefly described below.  For additional information, see the following:  http://www.afspc.af.mil/library/factsheets/index.asp  1)  Cyberspace Defense Analysis (CDA):  The Air Force Cyberspace Defense Analysis (CDA) weapon system conducts Defensive Cyberspace Operations by monitoring, collecting, analyzing, and reporting on sensitive information released from friendly unclassified systems, such as computer networks, telephones, email, and USAF websites.  CDA is vital to identifying Operations Security (OPSEC) disclosures.  The CDA weapon system is operated by three Active Duty units [68 Network Warfare Squadron (NWS), 352 NWS, 352 NWS Det 1] and two Reserve units [860 Network Warfare Flight (NWF) and 960 NWF] located at Joint Base San Antonio Lackland TX, Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam Field HI, Ramstein AB GE, Joint Base San Antonio Lackland TX, and Offutt AFB NE, respectively. 2)  Cyber Security and Control System (CSCS):  The Air Force Cyber Security and Control System (CSCS) weapon system is designed to provide 24/7 network operations and management functions and enable key enterprise services within Air Force unclassified and classified networks.  This system also supports defensive operations within those Air Force networks.  CSCS is operated by two Active Duty (AD) Network Operations Squadrons (NOS), one Air National Guard (ANG) Network Operations Security Squadron (NOSS) and two Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Associate NOSs aligned with the AD squadrons.  The 83 NOS (AD) and 860 NOS (Reserve) are located at Langley AFB VA; the 561 NOS (AD) and 960 NOS (Reserve) are located at Peterson AFB CO; and the 299 NOSS (ANG) is located at McConnell AFB KS. 3)  Air Force Intranet Control (AFINC):  The Air Force Intranet Control (AFINC) weapon system is the top level boundary and entry point into the Air Force Information Network (AFIN), and controls the flow of all external and interbase traffic through standard, centrally managed gateways.  The AFINC weapon system consists of 16 Gateway Suites and two Integrated Management Suites, and is operated by the 26 Network Operations Squadron (26 NOS) located at Gunter Annex, Montgomery, AL. 4)  Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment/Hunter (CVA/Hunt):  The Air Force Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment/Hunter (CVA/Hunter) weapon system executes vulnerability, compliance, defense and non-technical assessments, best practice reviews, penetration testing and Hunter missions on AF and DoD networks & systems.  Hunter operations characterize and  8 then eliminate threats for the purpose of mission assurance.  The weapon system can perform defensive sorties world-wide via remote or on-site access.  The CVA/Hunter weapon system is operated by one Active Duty unit, the 92d Information Operations Squadron (IOS), located at Joint Base San Antonio Lackland TX, and one Guard unit, the 262d Network Warfare Squadron (NWS), located at Joint Base LM McChord WA.  There are two Guard units in the process of converting to this mission, the 143d IOS and the 261st NWS, located at Camp Murray WA, and Sepulveda ANGS CA, respectively. 5)  Cyber Command and Control Mission System (C3MS):  The U.S. Air Force has mastered the ability to apply global reach, power and vigilance across the domains of air and space.  The AF applies these same precepts in the cyberspace domain as part of its mission to fly, fight, and win in air, space and cyberspace.  The Cyber Command and Control Mission System (C3MS) weapon system enables this mission by synchronizing other AF cyber weapon systems to produce operational level effects in support of Combatant Commanders worldwide.  C3MS provides operational level Command and Control (C2) and Situational Awareness (SA) of AF cyber forces, networks and mission systems.  C3MS enables the 24th Air Force Commander (24 AF/CC) to develop and disseminate cyber strategies and plans, then execute and assess these plans in support of AF and Joint warfighters.  The C3MS weapon system is operated by the 854th Combat Operations Squadron for the 624th Operations Center (624 OC) at Joint Base San Antonio Lackland TX. 6)  Air Force Cyberspace Defense (ACD):  The Air Force Cyberspace Defense (ACD) weapon system is designed to prevent, detect, respond to, and provide forensics of intrusions into unclassified and classified networks.  This weapon system supports the AF Computer Emergency Response Team in fulfilling their responsibilities.  ACD is operated by the 33d Network Warfare Squadron (NWS) located at Joint Base San Antonio Lackland TX, the Air Force Reserve’s 426th NWS located at Joint Base San Antonio Lackland TX and the Air National Guard's (ANG) 102d NWS located at Quonset ANGB RI. 9 Section A - General Information 1.  Purpose of the CFETP.  The CFETP provides the information necessary for AFCFM, MFMs, commanders, directors, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the training individuals in this AFS should receive to support their professional development and defines the competencies necessary to progress throughout their careers.  For purposes of this plan, training is divided into initial and advanced skills training; supplemental training; and continuing education.  Initial skills training is mandatory for award of the AFSC.  Continuing education is acquired through advanced degrees, commercially procured training, on-the-job training and specialized training as required by MAJCOM or units. 2.  Use of the CFETP.  The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty. 2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop and revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP.  Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training, and contracted training or exportable courses.  2.3.  Each new 17X officer will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in the Career Training Guide (Part II, Section C) prior to awarding of the 17X1X AFSC.  The list of courses in Part II, Section C will be used as a reference to support training. 3.  Coordination and Approval.  The Functional Authority for Cyberspace Operations, is the approval authority for the CFETP and will initiate a review of this document annually to ensure currency and accuracy.  The Functional Authority will assess whether the AFS has undergone any mission or role related changes, and as a result, if a U&TW is necessary.  The Cyberspace Operations Career Field Manager, MAJCOM Functional Managers and AETC training personnel will identify, develop and coordinate on the career field training requirements submitted to the Functional Authority. 10 Section B - Career Progression and Information 1.  Cyberspace Operations Specialty Description.  Executes cyberspace operations and information operations functions and activities.  Plans, organizes, directs and executes cyberspace and information operations such as, Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO), Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO), Department of Defense (DoD) Information Network (DoDIN) Operations and Mission Assurance for Air Force weapons systems and platforms.  Such operations cover the spectrum of mission areas within the cyberspace domain. 1.1.  Duties and Responsibilities: 1.1.1.  Plans and prepares for mission.

Researches or oversees research of technologies and advises commanders on associated risks and mitigation factors in conjunction with meeting requirements. 1.1.6.  Directs extension, employment, reconfiguration, adaptation and creation of portions of cyberspace to assure mission success for combatant commanders.  This includes both deliberate and crisis action scenarios. 2.  Skill and Career Progression. 2.1.  Adequate training and timely progression from the entry to the qualified level play an important role in the AF’s ability to accomplish its mission.  It is essential that everyone involved in training does his or her part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program.  Section C of this CFETP expands upon the following overview. 2.1.1.  Entry (17D1 and 17S1) Level.  For entry into this specialty, an officer must meet the mandatory requirements listed in the specialty description in the 17D or 17S AFSC Air Force Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD). 2.1.2.  Initial (17D2 and 17S2) Level.  Upon completion of UCT member will be awarded AFSC 17D2 or 17S2 as applicable.  Graduation from UCT meets career field Initial Qualification Training (IQT) standard.  11 2.1.3.  Qualified (17D3 and 17S3) Level.  For award of AFSC 17D3 and 17S3, officers must meet mission specific Mission Qualification Training (MQT) standards as identified by their Commander, MAJCOM and Desired Operational Capability Statements.  Commanders will develop and document MQT requirements in On-The-Job and Job Qualification Standards.  Commanders will certify MQT attainment. 2.1.4.  Staff Level (17X4).  Education and training requirements for this level are the same as the Qualified Level (17X3).  Officer must be appointed to a staff position at the MAJCOM, Numbered Air Force, Field Operating Agency, Headquarters Air Staff, or Combatant Command to achieve the Staff Level. 2.2.  Education.  For Education requirements reference Part I, Section C or the AFOCD. 2.3.  Training.  For Training requirements reference Part I, Section C or the AFOCD. 2.4.  Professional Development.  To experience the full breadth of opportunities in sufficient depth normally requires a variety of assignments.  Successful professional development is essential for those who will eventually hold top leadership positions in the Air Force.  A balanced approach to professional development will produce officers with relevant technical expertise, diverse command experience, an ability to apply the tenets of air, space, and cyberspace doctrine and a record of performance and assignments that validates these credentials.  Professional development requires the following: 2.4.1.  Maintaining a balanced approach in tours of duty (i.e., CONUS, overseas, joint, unit-level, agencies and headquarters), positions (i.e., instructor, commander, crew, and action officer), specialization (i.e., network operations, fixed communications, deployable communications, space operations, information operations, and cyber operations) and disciplines (i.e., logistics, operations, intelligence, and acquisitions) as well as diversity of experience across the spectrum of cyber operations. 2.4.2.  Completing professional military education, relevant advanced academic degree and supplemental and continuing technical training and education to include Professional Continuing Education in Cyber 200, 300 and 400 courses. 2.4.3.  Role of the Commander, Supervisor and Senior 17X officers in Professional Development. 2.4.3.1.  Commanders, supervisors and senior cyberspace operations officers must take an active role in officer professional development.  The 17X career pyramid shown in Figure 1 is available to facilitate this discussion.  Officers should review career goals with their commander, supervisor, and/or senior cyberspace operations officer at least annually.  Junior officers should use the results of these discussions to formulate input to their Airman Development Plans (ADP).  ADPs should be reviewed and updated annually in order to ensure the Air Force Personnel Center is aware of an officer’s professional development goals and opportunities sought. 2.4.3.2.  Cyberspace Operations officers whose supervisors are not in their career field, have the option of seeking out a senior Cyberspace Operations officer for mentoring.  12 3.  Training Decisions. 3.1.  The following decision was made at the Cyberspace Operations U&TW in April 2013. 3.1.1.  Complete a major course revision of the Undergraduate Cyber Training (Phase 1 and 2). The reason for the change is to reduce the amount of wash backs and eliminations.  The realigned course flow places the heavy technical blocks of instruction together eliminating the pendulum swing between non-technical and technical blocks. 3.1.2.  The career field identified the need for increased cyberspace training for all cyberspace operations  officers.  The training needed is currently being taught by the 39th IOS in INWT, but is not currently a part of IQT.  As a result, a decision was made to investigate incorporating the pre IQT training from INWT into UCT Phase 3. 3.1.3.  A strategic decision was made to change the focus of Scope Eagle to a more strategic based training course and align it with the current Cyber 200 and Cyber 300 continuum.  As a result, SAF A6 staff working with the 333rd TRS staff developed Cyber 400. 13 4.  Career Development  Figure 1.  17X Career Field Pyramid 4.1.  Career Field Pyramid.  The Cyberspace Operations Officer Career Path Pyramid shows progression through a variety of jobs.  This pyramid should be used as a planning guide by commanders, supervisors, and individuals in conjunction with other planning tools, to include AFI 36-2110, and senior cyberspace operations officer advice.  Early on, officers should develop a solid technical and operational experience base and continually focus on gaining depth and breadth as their careers progress.  We must build a force of competent, agile, and aggressive cyberspace operators able to apply their skills in an operational environment and articulate the effects cyberspace capabilities have on the AF mission in operational (vs technical) terms.  Cyber 200 and Cyber 300 are required professional military courses that are career specific. 4.2.  Every assignment and all assignment advice given must reflect this philosophy.  17X officers must know and fully understand all of our cyberspace capabilities and limitations.  They must be able to operate in any environment, perform a variety of cyberspace-related jobs, and understand all aspects of operations. 4.3.  Depth and Breadth.  A company grade officer should develop depth early in his/her career with appropriate level assignments.  Officers need to understand the technical application of the mission systems they man, how they fit into the Air Force, Joint, National and Combatant Commander Missions and how they interoperate or exchange information/data with Sister Service Mission Systems to achieve a Combatant Commander task.  Subsequently, officers will  14 gradually broaden their baseline both within and outside of the cyberspace operations career field through career breadth and career broadening tours. 4.4.  Ultimately, an individual’s career path will be influenced by his/her personal aspirations and the needs of the Air Force.  Ideally, officers will gain depth in the first 10 years of their career and assume more strategic positions as they mature through field grade ranks. 4.5.  Assignments should prepare cyberspace operations officers for command and leadership positions within the Air Force, Joint Commands and the cyber community.  The keys to success are breadth of experience, depth of knowledge, and high quality performance at every job level. 4.6.  Experience Tracking Through Career Path Tool (CPT).  In order to more effectively identify key experiences to fill AF and Joint requirements as well as better management of the AF career force, AF/A1 developed an experience coding and tracking system to more readily employ forces called CPT.  CPT pulls individual duty histories from MILPDS.  CPT is based upon a six digit Airmen Capability Management (ACM) code, where the first three digits consist of the career field AFS (17D or 17S) and the last three are used to categorize roles and experience.  The Career Field Manager (CFM) is charged to develop a methodology for the last three digits of the ACMs.  Once fully populated, CPT allows AF functional and CFMs the data necessary to monitor and develop the force to the appropriate breadth and depth of experience required for the health of the career field.  Additionally, CPT allows the AFPC assignment team and the Cyberspace Operations Development Team (DT) to quickly identify candidates for positions requiring specific experiences and certifications, replacing the time intensive process of delving into hundreds of individual documents (such as performance reports). 4.6.1.  Career Path Tool is online and fully functional. If they haven’t already, officers must go to the CPT website (https://afvec.langley.af.mil/af-cpt) and register.  Once registered, members should view and validate the coding of their duty histories.  Officers may correct discrepancies by either updating their duty histories in MILPDS (through the vMPF) or by using the “Report ACM Error” function from the “My Duty History” screen (if the error is related to the coding in CPT). 4.7. Duty Titles.  In order to facilitate implementation of the Air Force standardized experience tracking system (Career Path Tool) and mentoring tool (My Vector), a standardized set of duty titles is required.  The information will be used in all aspects of an Airmen’s career.  All cyberspace officers will have standardized duty titles.  These duty titles will include a standardized job role followed by a brief descriptor of the position:  Job Role, Descriptor.  Examples of such are: “Flt/CC, Operations”; “Branch Chief, Cyber Defense”; “Division Chief, C4 Capabilities”  15 Duty TitleAction OfficerAnalystBranch ChiefChiefCND ManagerCommanderCoSCrew  CommanderCyberspace OperatorDep DirectorDep Div ChiefDeputy Branch ChiefDeputy Group CCDirectorDirector of OperationsDivision ChiefDoSElement LeadEngineerEvaluatorExec OfficerFlight/CCIMAInstructorLeadMission CCOICProgrammerProject ManagerSection ChiefStudentTeam LeadVice CommanderWatch OfficerLTXXXXXXXXXXX*XXXXXXXXXCAtTMAJ LTCOLXXX*XXXXX*XXXXXX*XX*XX*X*XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX*XXXXXXXXXXXX*XXXXX*XXXXXXXXXX*XXXXX*XXXXXCOLXXXXXXX*XX * Denotes AFRC and ANG personnel Table 1.

Source documentation is submitted through local MPS and forwarded to AFPC Automated Records Management System (ARMS) shop for scanning into the Airman’s digital record. 2.7.  Qualification Training. 2.7.1.  Initial Qualification Training (IQT).  IQT is comprised of one or more courses covering system specific and/or positional specific training as a prerequisite to Mission Qualification Training.  Completion of UCT serves as the IQT for the Cyberspace Operations career field.  Weapons systems will have their own unique IQT and subsequent MQT progression. Completion of UCT meets the requirement for award of the 17X2X – Qualified IAW AFOCD. 2.7.2.  Mission Qualification Training (MQT).  MQT prepares an individual for a successful formal evaluation.  It focuses on filling training requirements not met at IQT, mastering local procedures, and increasing proficiency as needed.  MQT ensures a smooth transition from IQT to MR/CMR status.  MQT is comprised of training at a Formal Training Unit, if applicable, and  18 local training at the unit.  Units will determine MQT requirements in accordance with Lead MAJCOM policy and guidance.  Completion of MQT (unit or weapons system) meets the requirement for award of the 17X3X – Qualified IAW AFOCD. 2.8.  DoD 8570 Compliance. 2.8.1.  17D/17S officers will maintain compliance with DoD 8570.01-M.  All Cyber Operations Officers will attain and possess a current Information Assurance Management certification in accordance with DoD 8570.01-M.  There is no single answer on which certification an officer will attain.  Officers should stay abreast of changes in the Directive in order to maintain the appropriate certification.  While changes in this effort are being codified in AFMAN 33-285, Information Assurance (IA) Workforce Improvement Program, the following guidelines are provided.  Refer to AFMAN 33-285 for guidance on preferred certifications. 2.8.2.  Company Grade Officers (CGOs).  Most CGOs possess Security+ certification based on their attendance at Undergraduate Cyberspace Training.  Some will attain additional certifications based on mission assignment or personal initiative.  CGOs are tasked to maintain currency in their most advanced Information Assurance Management (IAM) certification. 2.8.3.  Field Grade Officers (FGOs).  As an officer matures in grade, they are required to lead  junior officers who possess IAM certifications.  As such, they will be required to attain and maintain currency on the applicable IAM certification.  Refer to AFMAN 33-285 for guidance on applicable certifications. 2.8.4.  Maintaining Currency.  Officers attaining certification with Air Force funding are required to register their certification with the Defense Manpower Data Center (https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/dwp/index.jsp).  Once codified in AFMAN 33-285, the Air Force will use the information provide to: 1) verify an officers certification and 2) pay for certification maintenance fees.  While an individual may attain multiple certifications over their career, the Air Force will pay maintenance fees for the most advanced certification. Section D - Resource Constraints 1.  Purpose.  This section identifies known resource constraints that preclude optimal/desired training from being developed or conducted, including information such as part numbers, national stock numbers, number of units required, cost, manpower, etc.  Included are narrative explanations of each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint has on training.  Finally, this section includes actions required, OPR and target completion date.  Resource constraints will be, at a minimum, reviewed and updated annually. 1.1.  Constraints.  Funding and budget constraints may influence class size, duration, and ability to meet AF training requirements. 19 PART II Section A - Course Training Standard 1.  Purpose. 1.1.  The Air Force uses the CTS to identify the training students receive in a specific course.  It serves as the foundational document which describes the course’s content and standard of proficiency each student is expected to achieve in order to successfully complete the course.  It’s also used as the basis for the Course Resource Estimate (CRE) which describes the human, physical, and fiscal resources required to execute the course.  In essence, the CTS is a contract between the Career Field Manager and the training provider, and can only be modified through the Specialty Training Requirements Team (STRT)/U&TW process and AFCFM policy directives.  The training tasks are based on an analysis of duties in the AF Officer Classification Directory for 17D and 17S AFSCs as described in the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) database. 1.1.1.
