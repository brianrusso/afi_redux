Initiating a Propriety Action Against a Regular Air Force Appointee. If  there  is  reason  tobelieve an officer is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for a Regular Air Forceappointment, the proper authority may begin action to:  Delay the appointment or remove the officer’sname from the nomination list (see Table 3.1. for instructions for delaying and removing an appointment).3.2. Who initiates a Regular Air Force Appointment Propriety. The immediate commander of anofficer recommended for a Regular Air Force appointment or a higher level officer exercising commandauthority may initiate a propriety challenge to the recommendation.  The commander must process thisaction with early identification, proper documentation, and priority handling as soon as the commanderdetermines the officer is not qualified.  A squadron section commander or staff head is not the officer'scommander for purposes of initiating such actions, unless both of these criteria are met:  The squadronsection commander or staff officer is equal to or senior in grade to the affected officer.  The Air Forceassigns the affected officer to the parent organization or staff attached by administrative orders (in accor-dance with AFI 51-604, Appointments to and Assumption of Command) to the squadron section or staffthat handles adverse personnel actions (other than actions under the Uniform Code of Military Justice).3.2.1. The commander initiating a propriety action begins a case file and ensures the case fileincludes all information pertaining to the recommendation.  (EXCEPTION:  The commander maywithhold information based on the written advice of a Judge Advocate.)  Allows the affected officer tocomment on any information added to the case file after he or she first reviews and acknowledges therecommendation.  Tries to include only original documents in the case file.  (Any copies must be eas-ily readable.  If necessary, retype and certify the documents.)  Follows the process outlined in Table3.1.  NOTE:  Formal rules of evidence do not apply to Regular Air Force propriety actions.3.2.2. The major commander reviews propriety action as outlined in Table 3.1.3.3. Procedures for Delaying  an Appointment. Commanders should initiate a delay if there is reason-able doubt as to the propriety of an officer being tendered a Regular appointment; hence, the commandershould delay the action until  determining whether the officer should be allowed to take the oath of office.The delay is effective when the commander notifies the officer of the delay, either verbally or in writing.Accomplish this notification prior to the officer executing the AF Form 133.  See Table 3.1. for the pro-cedures outlined for delaying an appointment. 3.4. Approving a Delay of an Appointment. The major commander approves initial delays.  The initialdelay may not exceed 6 months from the officer’s original effective date of delay.  The major commandernotifies the officer, in writing, the delay action has been approved.3.5. Extension of Initial Delay. The affected officer’s major commander must approve the extension inwriting, no later than 30 days before the initial delay period ends.  A delay may be extended more thanonce; however, no extension period may exceed 6 months.14AFI36-2610   30 APRIL 20033.6. Upon Expiration of Delay the Following Should Occur:  3.6.1.
