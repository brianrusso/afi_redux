Perform the qualitative fit test5 6.  Determine pass or fail6   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS: •  The Bitrex taste threshold screening, performed without wearing a respirator, is intended to determine whether the individual being tested can detect the taste of Bitrex.  •  During threshold screening (as well as during fit testing), subjects shall wear an enclosure hood. •  Throughout the threshold screening test, the test subject shall breathe through his or her slightly open mouth with tongue extended. The subject is instructed to report when he/she detects a bitter taste.  2. Perform the Threshold Screening Test   NOTES: 1. Prepare the Threshold Screening Test •  Using a nebulizer, the test conductor shall spray the threshold screening test solution into the enclosure.  •  To produce the aerosol, the nebulizer bulb is firmly squeezed so that the bulb collapses completely, and is then released and allowed to fully expand. • •  An initial ten squeezes are repeated rapidly and then the test subject is asked whether the Bitrex can be tasted. If the test subject reports tasting the bitter taste during the ten squeezes, the screening test is completed. The taste threshold is noted as ten regardless of the number of squeezes actually completed. If the first response is negative, ten more squeezes are repeated rapidly and the test subject is again asked whether the Bitrex is tasted. If the test subject reports tasting the bitter taste during the second ten squeezes, the screening test is completed. The taste threshold is noted as twenty regardless of the number of squeezes actually completed.  If the second response is negative, ten more squeezes are repeated rapidly and the test subject is again asked whether the Bitrex is tasted. If the test subject reports tasting the bitter taste during the third set of ten squeezes, the screening test is completed. The taste threshold is noted as thirty regardless of the number of squeezes actually completed.  If the Bitrex is not tasted after 30 squeezes, the test subject is unable to taste Bitrex and may not perform the Bitrex fit test.  • •  3. Document the taste threshold number •  The test conductor will take note of the number of squeezes required to solicit a taste response  4.  Instruct the individual on procedures to follow during the QLFT – during the test, the individual will be required to perform the following exercises: •  Normal Breathing: In a normal standing position, without talking, the subject shall breathe normally. •  Deep Breathing: In a normal standing position, the subject shall breathe slowly and deeply, taking caution not to hyperventilate.  8  AFQTP 4B051-19                                                                    Journeyman Training Guide:  Respiratory Protection   •  Head Side-to-Side: Standing in place, the subject shall slowly turn their head from side to side between the extreme positions on each side. The head shall be held at each extreme momentarily so the subject can inhale at each side. •  Moving Head Up and Down: Standing in place, the subject shall slowly move their head up and down. The subject shall be instructed to inhale in the up position (i.e., when looking at the ceiling). •  Talking: The subject shall talk out loud slowly and loud enough as so as to be heard clearly by the test conductor. Use the Rainbow Passage (at the end of the notes section), or have them count backwards from 100, or recite a memorized poem or song. •  Bending Over: The test subject shall bend at the waist as if they were to touch their toes. (Jogging in place shall be substituted if bending is not feasible.) •  Normal Breathing: In a normal standing position, without talking, the subject shall breathe normally.  5.  Perform the qualitative fit test  •  The test subject shall don the enclosure while wearing the respirator selected. •  As before, the test subject shall breathe through his or her slightly open mouth with tongue extended, and be instructed to report if he/she tastes the bitter taste of Bitrex. •  The nebulizer is inserted into the hole in the front of the enclosure and an initial concentration of the fit test solution is sprayed into the enclosure using the same number of squeezes (either 10, 20 or 30 squeezes) based on the number of squeezes required to elicit a taste response as noted during the screening test.  •  Every 30 seconds the aerosol concentration shall be replenished using one half the number of squeezes used •  Every 60 seconds the test subject will be instructed to start a new exercise as described in Step 4. initially (e.g., 5, 10 or 15).   6. Determine pass or fail •  The test subject shall indicate to the test conductor if at any time during the fit test the taste of Bitrex is detected. If the test subject does not report tasting the Bitrex, the test is passed.  If the taste of Bitrex is detected, the fit is deemed unsatisfactory and the test is failed. A different respirator shall be tried and the entire test procedure is repeated (taste threshold screening and fit testing). •  Rainbow Passage  When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act like a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.    9  AFQTP 4B051-19                                                                    Journeyman Training Guide:  Respiratory Protection   TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS       STS Line Item 4.14.7:  Perform qualitative fit tests 1.

If the individual is not familiar with using a particular respirator, direct them to don the mask several times and to adjust the straps each time to become adept at setting proper tension on the straps  5.  Assess comfort base on the following: position of the mask on the nose room for eye protection room to talk position of mask on face and cheeks • • • •  6.  For gas mask, attach a red adapter to the drinking tube.  7.  The mask is seated on the face by moving the head from side-to-side and up and down slowly while taking in a few slow deep breaths. Another facepiece shall be selected and retested if the test subject fails the user seal check tests.  8.  Either the negative and positive pressure seal checks described in 29 CFR 1910.134, Appendix B-1, or those recommended by the respirator manufacturer which provide equivalent protection to the procedures in Appendix B-1.  9.  The following exercises are administered during a respirator fit test. Each exercise is performed for one minute except for the GRIMACE; it’s done for 15 seconds. •  Normal Breathing: In a normal standing position, without talking, the subject shall breathe normally. •  Deep Breathing: In a normal standing position, the subject shall breathe slowly and deeply, taking caution not to hyperventilate. •  Head Side-to-Side: Standing in place, the subject shall slowly turn their head from side to side between the extreme positions on each side. The head shall be held at each extreme momentarily so the subject can inhale at each side. •  Moving Head Up and Down: Standing in place, the subject shall slowly move their head up and down. The subject shall be instructed to inhale in the up position (i.e., when looking at the ceiling). •  Talking: The subject shall talk out loud slowly and loud enough as so as to be heard clearly by the test conductor. Use the Rainbow Passage here, or have them count backwards from 100, or recite a memorized poem or song. •  Grimace: The test subject shall grimace by smiling or frowning. •  Bending Over: The test subject shall bend at the waist as if they were to touch their toes. (Jogging in place shall be substituted if bending is not feasible.) •  Normal Breathing: In a normal standing position, without talking, the subject shall breathe normally.     The following exercises are administered during a gas mask fit test: •  Normal Breathing: (head motionless): In a normal standing position, without talking, the subject breathes normally. •  Deep Breathing: (in through nose, out through mouth): In a normal standing position, the subject breathes slowly and deeply, taking care not to hyper-ventilate. •  Head Side-to-Side: (over shoulder, 1 second intervals): Standing in place, the subject slowly turns their head from side-to-side between extreme positions on each side. The subject holds their head at each extreme momentarily to allow them to inhale at each side. •  Moving Head Up and Down: Standing in place, the subject slowly moves their head up and down. Instruct the subject to inhale in the up position (i.e., when looking toward the ceiling). •  Rotating Chin: Standing in place, the subject moves their jaw in a circular pattern, holding the mouth slightly open to simulate speaking (like chewing gum).  10.  Particle count must be below 3 (particles/cm3) before starting the test.  11.  The PortaCount will automatically stop and calculate the overall fit factor for the entire set of exercises. The overall fit factor is what counts. The Pass or Fail message will indicate whether or not the test was successful.  12. In accordance with AFI48-137, results are documented in DOEHRS-IH and three (3) hard copies are provided to the individual, one for placement in mask carrier, one to be provided to the UDM, and one to be maintained by the member.   15  AFQTP 4B051-19                                                                    Journeyman Training Guide:  Respiratory Protection   TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS       STS Line Item 4.14.8:  Perform quantitative fit tests 1.
