Overview.  Air  Force  Policy  Directive  (AFPD)  48-1,  Aerospace  Medicine  Enterprise (AME),  emphasizes  the  need  to  “optimiz[e]  the  safety  and  health  of  AF  personnel  in  the performance  of  their  duties  in  any  circumstance  or  location.”    Moreover,  it  directs  that  the  Air Force  Medical  Service  will  focus  on  identifying  and  reducing  the  risk  of  injury  and  illness through appropriate surveillance, prevention and control programs.  This AFI supports AFPD 48-1  by  providing  commanders,  supervisors,  individuals,  and  medical  personnel  with  guidance  on how to collectively implement an effective TIPP in order to prevent and manage heat  and cold injuries and illnesses among Air Force personnel.  Failure to prevent and manage heat and cold injuries and illnesses can have disastrous impact on mission capability through degraded human performance  and  potentially  result  in  the  prolonged  or  permanent  incapacitation  or  death  of Airmen and civilian workers.   1.2.  Purpose.  Thermal  stress  is  a  physical  hazard  to  personnel,  and  as  such,  falls  under  the Occupational  and  Environmental  Health  (OEH)  Program  regulated  under  AFI  48-145, Occupational  and  Environmental  Health  Program.    AFI  48-145  states  “the  role  of  Aerospace Medicine  relative  to  human  occupational  and  environmental  health  focuses  on  health  risk assessment and associated health monitoring, sampling, and surveillance of actual and potential physical,  chemical,  biological,  and  radiological  hazards,  man-made  and  naturally  occurring,  in the  workplace  and  community  environment.”    This  AFI  is  an  aid  to  planning,  supporting,  and safely  executing  industrial  operations,  mission  directed  operations,  field  exercises  and  training, community events, and other installation functions affected by heat or cold stress.  This AFI also provides guidance for the prevention of thermal illness and injury.  It is beyond the scope of this publication to provide comprehensive guidance for the emergency treatment and aftercare of heat illness and cold injury.  1.3.  Focus.  The  focus  of  this  AFI  and  the  local  TIPP  is  risk  assessment  and  communication, employee education and community awareness. AFI48-151  7 APRIL 2016 5 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Thermal  Injury  Prevention  for  Airmen  in  Training.  Thermal  injury  prevention, particularly  heat  injury  prevention,  is  a  high  priority  for  Basic  Military  Training,  and  in  the preparation  and  training  of  Battlefield  Airmen  (BA)  and  Security  Forces  (SF).    In  order  to overcome the inherent training restrictions created by exclusively following the work/rest cycle, the  Training  Wing  (TRW)/Training  Group  (TRG)/Special  Tactics  Training  Squadron  (STTS) will  work  in  partnership  with  TRW  Safety  and  Preventive  Medicine  physicians  to  produce  a strategic,  comprehensive  set  of  heat  injury  prevention  countermeasures.    The  heat  injury prevention  will  be  targeted  to  the  unique  needs  of  each  training  objective/course,  and  will  be taught  and  integrated  into  risk  management  aspects  of  each  TRG  course.    A  defined  risk management  (RM)  matrix  will  be  developed  for  each  high-risk  training  event  in  the TRW/TRG/STTS.  This approach provides a level of heat injury prevention that far exceeds the work/rest cycle while assuring training standards and mission goals are accomplished.  Thermal injury prevention elements of the TRG RM matrix will be reviewed and approved by preventive medicine physicians upon initial development and re-reviewed in the event of any heat injuries. 3.2.  Occupational  and  Environmental  Monitoring.  The  risk  of  thermal  injury  can  be approximated  by  an  assessment  of  environmental  conditions,  such  as  air  temperature,  wind speed, humidity, and radiant heat.  There are other environmental factors affecting thermal injury risk,  however,  this  AFI  recommends  environmental  monitoring  techniques  that  can  be  easily applied,  measured  and  interpreted  when  conducting  both  deployed  or  home  base  operations; namely  Wet  Bulb  Globe  Temperature  (WBGT)  and  Frostbite  Risk  Level  (FRL).    Although  it does not correlate directly with WGBT, the Heat Index (HI) can be utilized for risk assessment purposes where no BE personnel are on site. 3.2.1.  Environmental monitoring is an approximation of the risk of injury and should not be used as a replacement for strong education, training, and awareness components of the local TIPP. 3.2.2.  Environmental  monitoring  should  be  accomplished  periodically  to  mark  transition from  one  thermal  injury  risk  stage  to  another.    The  data  collected  should  be  compared  to reference values in Table 3.1 and 3.2. and when necessary, used to determine administrative and personnel  procedures to  directly  reduce thermal strain  and subsequent  thermal stress at the  work  place.    Monitoring  at  the  installation  level  should  take  place  at  a  location representative  of  the  highest  risk,  typically  near  the  flight  line.    At  the  workplace  level, monitoring  should  be  conducted  in  close  approximation  to  the  conditions  in  which  the process of concern will be occurring. 3.2.3.  The  WBGT.  Detailed  analysis  of  the  influence  of  the  environment  on  thermal  stress requires  knowledge  of  the  following  four  basic  parameters:  air  temperature,  mean  radiant temperature, air speed and absolute humidity. The WBGT combines the measurement of two derived  parameters,  natural  wet-bulb  temperature  (Tnwb)  and  the  black  globe  temperature (Tg),  and,  in  some  situations,  the  measurement  of  the  basic  parameter,  dry-bulb  (air) temperature  (Tdb).    The  WBGT  formulae  can  utilize  either  oF  or  oC,  as  long  as  usage  is consistent; the equations are as follows:  AFI48-151  7 APRIL 2016 13 3.2.3.1.  WBGT = 0.7(Tnwb) + 0.2(Tg) + 0.1(Tdb) (outdoors). 3.2.3.2.  WBGT = 0.7(Tnwb) + 0.3(Tg) (with no radiant load). 3.2.4.  During  periods  of  hot  weather,  the  WBGT  is  calculated  and  the  appropriate  Heat Stress Risk and Flag Color can be determined using Table 3.1. 3.2.5.  During periods of cold weather, the air temperature and wind speed can be applied to Table 3.2 and  3.3 to determine the FRL. 3.2.6.  Modifications  to  the  WBGT  for  clothing.    Normal  duty-type  uniforms,  overalls,  and long-sleeved  civilian  work  clothes  do  not  drive  any  adjustment  to  the  WBGT.    Wearing  a second  layer  of  clothing,  such  as  chemical  protective  gear  or  firefighting  bunker  gear  adds +6°C/+10°F  to  the  WBGT  measurement  for  light  work,  and  +12°C/+20°F  for  moderate  / heavy work.  Additionally, wear of body armor adds an additional +3°C/+5°F to the WBGT measurement.  This  can,  potentially,  drive  a  shift  from  low  or  moderate  to  extreme  risk  of heat injury. 3.2.7.  Heat Index. When operations are taking place at locations where no BE personnel are on site, the HI may be used for risk assessment purposes.  HI uses different assumptions and end states than WBGT, and so the two cannot be directly compared.  The primary measure of heat  stress  for  the  Air  Force  remains  the  WBGT.    The  HI  is  devised  for  shady,  light  wind conditions.  Exposure to full sun can increase HI values by up to 15 °F.  The advantage of the HI  formulation,  despite  its  complex  appearance,  is  that  it  requires  only  a  temperature  and relative humidity (RH) for calculation.  The base formula for HI is: 3.2.7.1.  HI  =  -42.379  +  2.049Tdb  +  10.143RH  -  0.2248TdbRH  –  0.00684(Tdb2)  – 0.0548(RH2) + 0.00123 (Tdb2)RH + 0.000853Tdb(RH2) – 0.00000199(Tdb2) (RH2) 3.2.7.2.  Adjustment for RH less than 13% and 80 < Tdb <112 °F: 3.2.7.2.1.  - [(13-RH)/4] * SQRT{[17-ABS(Tdb-95.)]/17} 3.2.7.2.2.  where  ABS  and  SQRT  are  the  absolute  value  and  square  root  functions, respectively. 3.2.7.3.  Adjustment for RH > 85% and 80 < Tdb <87 °F: 3.2.7.3.1.  + [(RH-85)/10] * [(87-Tdb)/5] 3.3.  Communication.  The thermal injury risk should be displayed around the installation using a color-coded system, such as flags or boards, or communicated to the base via intranet or radio networks.    Tables  3.1  and  3.3  display  the  risk-based  colors  for  both  heat  and  cold  stress, respectively.  For reference, Table 3.4 shows the Equivalent Chill Temperature (“Wind Chill”). 3.4.  Workplace  Education  and  Training.  Education  and  training  are  fundamental  to  an effective TIPP. This AFI recommends annual education and training on the signs and symptoms of  thermal  strain  and  first  aid  procedures,  work/rest  and  work/warming  cycles,  the  additive effects of personal protective equipment, and the importance of good hydration.

The WBGT index is based on the response of the six inch diameter globe. This measurement uses a six inch diameter hollow copper sphere painted matte black on the outside and containing an unshielded dry-bulb thermometer in the center of the sphere.  Note that some current meters use a smaller sphere that is correlated to a six inch sphere. Cold  Injury—Cold environments pose a threat to the individual if they exceed the capacity of the  body’s  thermo-regulatory  response  mechanisms.  The  main  hazards  are  hypothermia associated  with  a  fall  in  the  body’s  core  temperature  and/or  tissue  damage  that  falls  under  the broad  headings  of  FCI  and  NFCI  (Non-freezing  Cold  Injury).  For  the  purpose  of  this  AFI  the term ‘Cold Injury’ is all encompassing and applies to an individual who becomes incapacitated as the result of a drop in core body temperature, FCI or NFCI. Conduction—The  transfer  of  heat  between  two  materials  that  are  in  contact  with  each  other, with heat passing from the warmer material to the cooler material. Convection—The  heat  transfer  between  molecules  directly  adjacent  to  each  other,  such  as between  the  body  and  the  surrounding  air.    The  rate  of  heat  exchange  is  a  function  of  the difference in temperature between the skin and the surrounding air and the rate of air movement over the skin.  As the temperature of the air decreases, the amount of heat loss due to convection increases.  Increasing air movement increases convective heat loss. Diuresis—Unusually large urine output.  Increased excretion of urine caused by excessive intake of fluids, a drug, or a disease. Dry—Bulb  (air)  Temperature  (Td)—This  is  the  temperature  measured  with  an  ordinary alcohol-in  glass,  or  mercury-in-glass  thermometer  whose  bulb  is  kept  dry  and  shielded  from direct sun radiation. Evaporation—The  process  of  liquid  water  converting  to  a  vapor.    Evaporation  produces  a cooling effect on the skin.  Evaporative heat loss is a function of the rate of air movement over the skin  and the water vapor pressure difference  between the surrounding air and the wet  skin.  As  the  rate  of  air  movement  increases,  the  rate  of  evaporation  increases,  resulting  in  a  cooling effect.  However, as humidity increases, evaporative heat loss decreases. Exercise-associated  Collapse—Inability  to  stand  or  walk  as  a  result  of  lightheadedness  or syncope  occurring  immediately  after  completing  a  workout  due  to  abrupt  decrease  in  venous return.  Exertional Heat Stroke—The two main criteria for diagnosing exertional heat stroke (EHS) are a  core  temperature  above  104°F  (40°C),  measured  immediately  following  collapse  during strenuous  activity,  and  central  nervous  system  dysfunction  (disorientation,  headache,  irrational behavior, irritability, emotional instability, confusion, altered consciousness, or seizure). Heat Exhaustion—Heat exhaustion is characterized by collapse due to the inability to maintain adequate cardiac output due to strenuous physical exercise and environmental heat stress.  Core temperature is usually 101 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit and no significant central nervous system dysfunction is present at the time of collapse. Heat  Illness—Traditionally  heat  illness  has  been  divided  into  heat  exhaustion  and  (exertional) heat  stroke.  In  practice  the  division  is  difficult  to  define;  thus,  for  the  purpose  of  this  AFI  the 20 AFI48-151  7 APRIL 2016 term ‘Heat Illness’ is all encompassing and applies to an individual who collapses as the result of a rise in core body temperature. Heat  Index  (HI)—An alternative measure of heat risk that combines dry bulb temperature and relative  humidity.    Used  in  the  AF  for  risk  assessment  when  the  preferred  method  (WBGT)  is unavailable.  See 3.2.7. Heat Strain—The physiological or psychological response to heat stress, which is manifested in specific  cardiovascular,  thermoregulatory,  respiratory,  renal,  endocrine,  and  other  bodily functions, which differ from acceptable human norms. Heat  Stress—The  combination  of  factors  which  result  in  heat  gains  or  losses  relative  to  the body, or which prevent the body’s regulatory mechanisms from working efficiently. Heat Stroke—See ‘Exertional Heat Stroke.’ Heat Syncope—See ‘Exercise-associated Collapse’ and ‘Non-exertional Heat Syncope.’ Humidity—An  expression  of  the  quantity  of  water  vapor  mixed  with  the  other  atmospheric gases. Hypo-hydration—Dehydration of the human or animal body. Natural  Wet—Bulb  Temperature  (Tnwb)—This  is  the  temperature  measured  with  a thermometer, with a wet wick fitted closely over the bulb or electronic sensor. Non-exertional Heat Syncope—Transient loss or near-loss of consciousness due to the indirect effects  of  high  ambient  temperatures.    Heat  induced  vasodilation  can  cause  non-exertional syncope prior to acclimatization in the first few days of new exposure to high temperatures with prolonged standing or sudden standing. Radiant  Heat—Radiant  heat  loss  occurs  when  surrounding  objects  have  lower  surface temperatures  than  the  body.    Radiant  heat  gain  occurs  when  surrounding  objects  have  higher surface  temperatures  than  the  body.    Heat  exchange  due  to  radiation  is  independent  of  air movement. Vasodilation—Widening of blood vessels, which increases heat removal but also lowers blood pressure. Wet-Bulb  Globe  Temperature  (WBGT)—This is an empirical index of heat that provides an index WBGT = 0.7(Tnwb) + 0.2(Tg) + 0.1(Tdb) the  behavior  of the  human  body  under  heat  strain.                                                          that  corresponds to  AFI48-151  7 APRIL 2016 21 THERMAL INJURY PRINCIPLES AND TRAINING INFORMATION Attachment 2 A2.1.  Basic Heat Exchange Principles.  Heat illness and cold injury are caused respectively by an  excessive  rise  or  fall  in  core  human  body  temperature.  Control  of  human  body  temperature can be simplified in the following heat balance equation: A2.1.1.  Heat storage = Heat Gained - Heat Lost A2.1.2.  The  human  body  gains  heat  from  metabolism,  shivering,  and  physical  exertion.    It may either gain or lose heat from the external environment via radiant energy (e.g., sunlight), convection  (e.g.,  air  passing  against  the  skin),  conduction  (e.g.,  direct  contact  with  a  solid body  or  immersion),  and  evaporation  (e.g.,  sweating).    Some  heat  can  be  lost  through exhalation.    Enclosure  in  confined  spaces  and  wearing  impermeable  individual  personal equipment  (IPE) may prevent  heat  loss.  A more in-depth  discussion of metabolic load and heat  balance  can  be  found  in  TB  MED  507,  Heat  Stress  Control  and  Heat  Casualty Management. A2.2.  Acclimatization.  The  process  of  acclimatization  is  characterized  by  a  series  of physiological  adjustments  that  occur  when  an  individual  is  exposed  to  a  target  climate. Acclimatization  must  be  specific  for  the  destination  environment  and  it  produces  beneficial physiological  changes  to  the  individual  that  minimize  the  risk  of  thermal  injury.  A  period  of acclimatization  is  required  for  all  personnel  regardless  of  each  individual’s  physical  condition. An  individual  is  considered  acclimatized  if  he  or  she  has  undertaken  at  least  two  continuous hours  of  work  or  exercise  in  five  of  the  last  seven  days,  or  10  of  the  last  14  days  in  the  same environmental  conditions  as  the  proposed  activity.  However,  adaptation  is  lost  within  a  few weeks  unless  the  exposure  to  heat  is  repeated  regularly  at  intervals  of  four  days  or  less.  If exposure to the targeted  environment has followed a substantial period of travel or crossing time zones, the acclimatization time must be assumed to be longer than 10 days. In general, one extra day should be allowed for each time zone crossed. A2.3.  Heat  Strain  and  Performance.  In  a  heat  strain  situation  (where  the  core  body temperature is elevated), individual fatigue and time-to-exhaustion are directly related to the rate of heat gain, and are inversely related to the initial core body temperature. A2.3.1.  Heat stress can reduce mental performance, which is probably mediated by thermal discomfort (from high skin temperature, very wet skin, and cardiovascular strain). However, a very incomplete database exists relating mental performance degradation relative to graded levels  of  heat  stress  and  strain.    Mental  performance  degrades  the  most  in  boring, monotonous  and  repetitive  tasks.    In  addition,  tasks  that  require  attention  to  detail, concentration, and short-term memory and are not self-paced may degrade from heat stress.  Heat  stress  slows  reaction  time  and  decision  times.    Routine  tasks  are  done  more  slowly. Errors of omission are more common.  Vigilant task performance will degrade slightly after 30 minutes and markedly after 2 to 3 hours of exposure to elevated temperatures. A2.3.2.  Dehydration  (>2  percent  body  weight  loss)  adversely  affects  mental  function  (for example,  serial  addition,  response  time  and  word  recognition)  during  heat  exposure.  These performance decrements probably increase with the level of dehydration. 22 AFI48-151  7 APRIL 2016 A2.3.3.  Individual  and  collective  risk  of  aircrew  and  ground  crew  error  exists  in  thermal environmental  extremes.  Research  clearly  demonstrates  a  significant  increase  in  the  risk  of rotary aircrew errors associated with rising ambient temperatures. Table A2.1.  Effects of Acclimatization to Heat. Increase in: Work output Endurance Plasma volume Sweat production Decrease in: Heart rate Pulse pressure Basal oxygen consumption Sweat electrolyte concentration Skin and core temperature A2.4.  Cold  Strain  and Performance.  Cold stress that does not cause a decrease in core body temperature of more than 0.9 °F or allow muscle temperatures to go below 97 °F does not alter most physiological performance. However, for every 1.8 °F fall in  core or muscle temperature, maximal endurance exercise capability is lowered by about 5 percent, exercise endurance time is lowered by 20 percent, and maximal strength and power output is lowered by 5 percent. A2.4.1.  Pain  sensations  increase  when  skin  temperatures  decrease  to  68  °F  and  manual dexterity  declines  after  finger-skin  temperatures  decrease  to  60  °F  because  of  cooling  of tissues  and  decreases  in  joint  mobility.  Tactile  sensitivity  is  reduced  as  skin  temperatures drop  below  43  °F.    These  changes  are  due  to  decreased  tissue  temperatures,  so  that  an individual  can  have  a  normal  body  core  temperature  but  still  have  a  significant  decline  in performance of gross and fine motor skills because the hands and fingers are cold. A2.4.2.  The relationship between finger temperature and performance changes is not linear; rather, there is  a clear breakpoint in  performance at  skin temperatures below 60 °F as hand performance  drops  off  by  10  to  20  percent,  and  a  second  sharp  decline  occurs  at  a  skin temperature less than 43 °F when tactile sensitivity is lost. A2.4.3.  Duration of cold exposure also has a role because underlying tissues will cool more with longer exposures, leading to greater declines in performance as muscles and nerves will both cool.  Immersion of the hands and forearms in 50 °F water for as short as 5 minutes can lower manual dexterity by 20 to 50 percent. A2.4.4.  Cold strain can degrade mental performance on complex thinking tasks by 17 to 20 percent.    Memory  registration  for  newly  presented  information  is  impaired  when  core temperature  falls  between  94  and  95  °F,  and  short-term  memory  declines  up  to  20  percent with  significant  peripheral  cooling  with  no  change  in  core  body  temperature.    A  person’s ability to remain vigilant declines when the core body temperature is decreasing.  Activities that  require  continuous,  rapid  and  accurate  responses  are  impaired  by  13  percent  at  low ambient temperatures that cause skin temperatures to fall. A2.5.  Individual Risk Factors for Heat Injury.  There is wide variation in human tolerance to heat  stress.  Nevertheless,  it  is  possible  to  identify  factors  that  cause  particular  individuals  to become  heat  casualties.  The  following  personal  factors  must  be  considered  when  assessing individual heat injury risk: A2.5.1.  Obesity. AFI48-151  7 APRIL 2016 23 A2.5.2.  Lack of physical fitness. A2.5.3.  Lack of sleep. A2.5.4.  Recent alcohol intake. A2.5.5.  Concurrent mild illness e.g., diarrhea, viral illness, fever. A2.5.6.  Dehydration. A2.5.7.

Elements  of  Heat  Injury  Prevention.  A comprehensive heat weather injury prevention and management program will follow the principles of risk management by identifying hazards, assessing the hazards in terms of severity, probability, and implementing appropriate controls to abate  the  hazards.  Spot  checking  and  supervision  by  supervisors  must  be  employed  to  ensure control measures are being implemented. Units train using risk-management principles; therefore commanders and leaders will apply the same framework to prevent heat weather injuries.  Heat-casualty prevention is a command responsibility. A2.9.1.  Identifying and Assessing Hazards. Hot weather may present a hazard if any one of the following is present: A2.9.1.1.  High heat category, especially on several sequential days. The WBGT should be measured when ambient temperature is over 75° F. A2.9.1.2.  High-exertion level of training, especially on several sequential days. A2.9.1.3.  Lack  of  acclimatization  (at  least  10  to  14  days  for  new  arrivals  to  become acclimated) and other individual risk factors, such as: A2.9.1.3.1.  Lack of quality sleep. A2.9.1.3.2.  Poor fitness. 26 AFI48-151  7 APRIL 2016 A2.9.1.3.3.  Overweight. A2.9.1.3.4.  Minor illnesses such as cold symptoms. A2.9.1.3.5.  Prescribed or over-the-counter medications/supplement/dietary aids.

Skin disorders such as heat rash and sunburn. A2.9.1.4.  High temperatures at night/rest overnight. A2.9.2.  Developing Controls.  Heat casualties can be controlled through: A2.9.2.1.  Establishing standard operating procedures. A2.9.2.2.  Posting heat casualty prevention information where it is easily accessible. A2.9.2.3.  Planning operations and events, to include: A2.9.2.3.1.  Minimizing  consecutive  days  of  heavy  physical  training  when  heat stressors exist. A2.9.2.3.2.  Providing medical and evacuation support. A2.9.2.3.3.  Providing adequate hydration.

Knowledge  of  standardized  guidelines  for  warm  weather  working  conditions fluid replacement and work/rest cycles. A2.9.3.  Implementing  Controls.  Heat  casualty  controls  can  be  implemented  through  the following actions. A2.9.3.1.  A decision to accept risk at the appropriate level. A2.9.3.2.  Hydration standards. A2.9.3.3.  Food intake. A2.9.3.4.  Random checks. A2.9.3.5.  Clothing recommendations. A2.9.4.  Supervising  and  Evaluating.  The  final  step  in  the  risk-management  process  is  the supervision and evaluation of the controls taken to prevent heat casualties. Examples are: A2.9.4.1.  Enforcing SOPs. A2.9.4.2.  Delegating responsibilities ensure control measures have been implemented. A2.9.4.3.  Monitoring the adequacy/progress of implementation of control measures. A2.9.4.4.  Performing spot-checks of Airmen. A2.10.  Elements of Cold Injury Prevention.  A comprehensive cold weather injury prevention and  management  program  should  follow  the  principles  of  risk  management  by  identifying AFI48-151  7 APRIL 2016 27 hazards,  assessing  the  hazards  in  terms  of  severity,  probability,  and  implementing  appropriate controls to abate the hazards. Spot checking and supervision by supervisors must be employed to ensure  control  measures  are  being  implemented.  Units  train  using  risk-management  principles; therefore  commanders  and  leaders  will  apply  the  same  framework  to  prevent  cold  weather injuries.  Cold-casualty prevention is a command responsibility. A2.10.1.  Airman and Leadership Education. A2.10.1.1.  Assessing cold stress. A2.10.1.2.  Recognizing and preventing cold injuries. A2.10.1.3.

Experiential learning, to include: A2.10.1.5.1.  Remembering  that  true  effectiveness  in  cold  environments  only  comes with experience. A2.10.1.5.2.  Practicing  the  clothing  principles  of  layering  and  staying  dry.  These principles  must  be  tailored  to  the  individual,  and  must  be  practiced  so  that  Airmen will  learn  when  to  dress  down  (before  sweating  begins)  and  when  to  add  layers (before shivering begins). A2.10.1.5.3.  Using  equipment  in  the  cold.  Everything  takes  longer,  so  practice  is needed;  Airmen also  need to  be able to  identify  where special tools or clothing (for example, contact gloves) may be necessary. A2.10.1.5.4.  Planning  for  longer  missions  (weather  may  change  quickly  and  hinder operations, and Airmen fatigue impacts even routine operations). A2.10.1.6.  The posting of cold-casualty prevention information as an ongoing reminder. A2.10.1.7.  Establishing standing operating procedures for most routines. A2.10.2.  Training. A2.10.2.1.

Feet are to be washed daily if possible. 28 AFI48-151  7 APRIL 2016 A2.10.2.1.7.  Gaiters are to be worn to keep boots dry when necessary. A2.10.2.1.8.  Gloves or mittens are to be worn. A2.10.2.1.9.  Hands must be warmed under clothes before hands become numb. A2.10.2.1.10.  Skin  contact  with  snow,  fuel,  or  bare  metal  is  to  be  avoided,  and proper gloves are to be worn when handling fuel or bare metal. A2.10.2.1.11.  Gloves  are  to  be  waterproofed  by  treating  them  with  waterproofing compounds. A2.10.2.1.12.  Face and ears are to be covered with a scarf, and an insulated cap with flaps over the ears or a balaclava is to be worn. A2.10.2.1.13.  Face  and  ears  are  to  be  warmed  by  covering  them  with  warm  hands, and the face and ears must not be rubbed. A2.10.2.1.14.

Health and nutrition must be sustained. A2.10.2.2.1.  Alcohol  use  is  to  be  avoided  (alcohol  impairs  the  body’s  ability  to shiver). A2.10.2.2.2.  Tobacco  products  are  to  be  avoided  (tobacco  products  decrease  blood flow to the skin). A2.10.2.2.3.  All meals are to be eaten to maintain energy. A2.10.2.2.4.  Water  or  warm  nonalcoholic  fluids  are  to  be  drunk  to  prevent dehydration. A2.10.2.2.5.  Carbon Monoxide poisoning must be prevented by using only approved heaters  in  sleeping  areas,  by  not  sleeping  near  the  exhaust  of  a  vehicle  while  the vehicle  is  running,  and  by  not  sleeping  in  an  enclosed  area  where  an  open  fire  is burning. A2.10.2.4.  Airmen will protect each other. A2.10.2.4.1.  Airmen  are  to  watch  for  signs  of  frostbite  and  other  cold  weather injuries in their buddies. A2.10.2.4.2.

Supervising  and  Evaluating.  The  final  step  in  the  risk-management  process  is  the supervision and evaluation of the control taken to prevent cold casualties. Examples are— A2.10.3.1.  Ensuring  all  Airmen  and  leaders  are  educated  and  experienced  in  the prevention,  recognition,  and  treatment  of  cold-weather  injuries,  as  well  as  effective measures for working in cold environments. A2.10.3.2.  Delegating  responsibilities  (inspections,  buddy  checks)  to  ensure  control measures have been implemented. A2.10.3.3.  Monitoring the adequacy/progress of implementation of control measures. A2.10.3.4.  Performing spot-checks of shelters, rewarming facilities, and food and drink supplies. A2.10.3.5.

Introduction to Fighter Index Thermal Stress (FITS) The FITS was developed in 1979 to  provide  a  measure  of  the  thermal  stress  experienced  by  aircrew  in  fast  jet  aircraft  with canopies  and  environmental  control  systems,  engaged  in  combat  sorties  at  low  altitudes,  direct sunlight  or  light  overcast,  and  high  outside  temperatures.    The  FITS  was  derived  from  the WBGT  using  in-flight  data  on  cockpit  environments  and  assuming  a  fixed  contribution  from solar  heating.  The  FITS  table  uses  ground  dry  bulb  temperature  and  wet  bulb  temperatures  to yield an estimate of cockpit thermal stress. A3.2.  Assessing FITS Reference Values  In hot environments, the FITS provides a measure of thermal strain required which can be used to determine risk of aircrew heat stress and injury. The calculated values assume an Aircrew Equipment Assembly (AEA) thermal insulation of 1.5-2.0 clo,  roughly  equivalent  to  light,  summer  AEA;  therefore,  the  index  is  not  appropriate  for  cold weather, immersion suit or other types of individual protective equipment. A3.2.1.  The FITS equation utilizes Tpwb and Tdb, the ground psychometric wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures, respectively. A3.2.1.1.  In Fahrenheit, the equation is: FITS = 0.83Tpwb + 0.35Tdb + 9.14°F A3.2.1.2.  In Celsius, the equation is: FITS = 0.83Tpwb + 0.35Tdb + 5.08°C   A3.2.2.  BE  personnel  determine  the  FITS  zones  shown  at  Table  A3.1  (Fahrenheit)  and  A3.2 (Celsius). Aircrews have a responsibility to monitor their physical condition and not to exceed their capability to safely accomplish the mission. AFI48-151  7 APRIL 2016 31 Table A3.1.

FITS  Actions.  FITS  reference  values  and  their  associated  zones  are  not  exact demarcations,  but  represent  the  temperatures  and  humidities  at  which  aircrews  begin  to experience heat-stress-related effects.  These effects may vary with the individual, the particulars of the ground and flight aspects of the mission, the particular clothing worn, and so forth.  The following FITS Action, therefore, are guides, rather than directives. A3.3.1.  FITS  Normal  Zone.  The  Normal  Zone  is  subjectively  hot,  but  normally  safe,  and generally  covers  FITS  Reference  Values  under  90  °F  (32  °C)  The  following  procedures should be implemented: A3.3.1.1.  Be alert for symptoms of heat stress. A3.3.1.2.  Ensure adequate fluid intake. A3.3.2.  FITS  Caution  Zone.  The  Caution  Zone  includes  conditions  that  are  tolerable  if adequate precautions are taken, and generally covers FITS Reference Values between 91 °F and 101 °F (33 °C and 37 °C) The following procedures should be implemented: A3.3.2.1.  Be alert for symptoms of heat stress. 32 AFI48-151  7 APRIL 2016 A3.3.2.2.  Drink plenty of non-caffeinated fluids. A3.3.2.3.  Avoid exercise 4 hours prior to take off. A3.3.2.4.  Limit  ground  operations  time  outside  an  air-conditioned  environment  to  90 minutes. A3.3.3.  FITS Danger Zone. The Danger Zone represents conditions that induce progressive heat storage and dehydration sufficient to  affect  crew performance during normal low-level missions,  and  comprise  FITS  Reference  Values  over  102  °F  (38  °C).  When  the  FITS Reference Value is over 115 °F (42 °C), consider limiting or cancelling non-essential flight operations,  as  the  thermal  stress  constitutes  a  serious  drain  on  physiological  reserves.    The following procedures should be implemented: A3.3.3.1.  Minimum recovery time is two hours (landing time to next take off.) A3.3.3.2.  Limit  ground  operations  time  outside  air-conditioned  environment  to  45 minutes. A3.3.3.3.  If possible, wait in a cool shaded area if the aircraft is not ready to fly. A3.3.3.4.  Complete a maximum of two aircraft inspections, two exterior inspections on initial sorties, and one exterior inspection on subsequent sorties for fighters and trainers. A3.3.3.5.  Undergraduate Flying Training solo students should be limited to one exterior aircraft inspection per sortie.
