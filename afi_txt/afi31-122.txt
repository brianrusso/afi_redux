When an appeal is made, AF/A4S convenes the Air Force Security Forces Qualifications Review Board  (SF-QRB)  to  make  the  necessary  employment-  related  decisions  as  described  in Attachment 8. 2.2.1.6.  All  otherwise  qualified  applicants  will  undergo the  Job  Compatibility Assessments  (JCA)  as  part  of  the  interview/selection  process.  (T-2)  The  DFC  is responsible  for  the  successful  completion  of  the  JCA  for  all  applicants  as  part  of  the applicant’s interview. The JCA provides the DFC/hiring authority a tool for the selection of the best DAF CP/SG applicant. DAF CP/SGs should take the JCA survey only once. 2.2.1.6.1.  Each  participating  SF  unit  training  section  was  provided  the  JCA  and materials.  Ensure JCA is accounted for, secured in a container in the unit, handled as FOUO,  and  treated  as  sensitive  testing  material.  The  JCA  Procedures  Manual contains  the  instructions  for  how  the  JCA  is  administered  to  include  scheduling, proctoring, shipping/mailing of answer sheets and how the hiring authority can access the  applicant’s  score.  The  JCA  can  be  accessed  from  the  AFIMSC/PSU  AFSFC SMARTNet  at  https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/.  The  JCA  Procedures  Manual  also contains  POCs  for  AFPC  support.  Contact  AFIMSC/PSU  AFSFC/SFOP  for  AFPT 987 answer sheets and for assistance. 2.2.1.7.

Individuals  tentatively  selected for appointment to  DAF CP/SG  positions are subject to  the  following  pre-placement  checks/inquiries.  The  Security  Forces  unit/organization  will request  checks/inquiries,  performed  by  the  Information  Protection  Office,  in  order  to  meet the  minimal  National  Agency  Check  Plus  Written  Inquiries  (NACI)  standard.  (T-0)  Notify the  DFC  and  contact  the  CPO/CPF  for  advice  regarding  options  defined  by  applicable Federal  and/or  agency  instruction  for  revocation  or  suitability  to  maintain  employees’ security clearance. 2.2.2.1.  Local files check. This is normally a check of the SF Management Information System  (SFMIS)  and/or  Defense  Central  Index  of  Investigations  (DCII)  to  determine  if unfavorable information has been recorded on individuals covering the time period of age 18 to present. 2.2.2.2.  Reference  check.  This  is  a  check  with  former  employers,  supervisors  and personal references. 2.2.2.3.  Arrest  and  Criminal  History  Records  Check  (except  where  prohibited  by  local and  state  law).  This  is  normally  a  National  Crime  Information  Center  (NCIC)  check  of the  state(s)  in  which  an  applicant  has  resided.  A  check  of  criminal  history  record information  contained  in  the  III  System  and  the  FIRS  may  be  made  available  for  the purpose of screening prospective DAF CP/SG applicants pursuant to 28 CFR § 20.33 (a) (1),  Dissemination of  Criminal History Record Information, which allows those records to  be  made  available  to  criminal  justice  agencies  for  criminal  justice  purposes,  which purposes  include  the  screening  of  employees  or  applicants  for  employment  hired  by criminal justice agencies.  Utilize code “J” (Criminal Justice Employment only) for these checks. 2.2.2.4.  National  Agency  Check  Plus  Written  Inquiries  and  Credit  Check  (NACIC). Units  will  obtain  NACIC  reviews  for  all  required  basic  positions;  OPM  conducts  these reviews for all civilian employees assigned to non-sensitive positions. (T-0) (See AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management).   However, when DAF CP/SG positions which  are  normally  categorized  as  non-critical  sensitive  positions,  and    may  require completion  of  a  favorable  Access  National  Agency  Check  with  Written  Inquiries  and Credit  Check  (ANACI)  prior  to  appointment  (See  AFI  31-501,  Personnel  Security Program  Management),  units  will  strive  to  complete  ANACI  before  actually  filling  the position.  (T-0)  If  absolutely  necessary,  a  pre-placement  waiver  may  be  authorized  in writing by appropriate authority listed in AFI 31-501.  In such cases, the position may be filled  only  after  the  ANACI  has  been  initiated,  as  long  as  favorable  NACI  has  been completed. 2.2.2.4.1.  Responsible  officials  (See  Chapter  3,  AFI  31-501)  will  implement  a tracking  system  to  ensure  records  of  personnel  granted  waivers  are  monitored  to ensure  results  are  received.  (T-1)  CPO  will  share  ANACI  results  with  requesting organization upon receipt. (T-3) 2.2.2.5.  Lautenberg  Amendment  to  the  Gun  Control  Act  of  1968,  18  U.S.C.  §  922  (g) (9).  Suitability  for  employment  based  upon  the  requirements  of  the  Lautenberg Amendment is normally determined through an arrest and criminal history records check and/or local files check. If a favorable determination is made, when hired; the employee will  be  briefed  on  the  Lautenberg  Amendment  and  the  briefing  will  be  documented  on   12  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 DD  Form  2760,  Qualification  to  Possess  Firearms  or  Ammunition,  which  will  be maintained in the employee’s CPO and Unit personnel files. 2.2.3.  The security forces unit/organization where employment is being sought will make the results of the local files check, reference check, and arrest and criminal history records check available to the CPO/Civilian Personnel Flight (CPF) with a recommendation to continue or discontinue processing of the applicant. (T-3) Results of the ANACI are normally provided to  CPO/CPF  by  AFCAF  or  OPM.  Receipt  of  the  ANACI  results,  the  last  piece  of information, thus makes available all pre-employment information to hiring officials for use in making hiring decisions. Additionally, provisions of HSPD-12 allow issuance of the CAC after a favorable return on fingerprints. 2.3.  Drug Testing. 2.3.1.  All DAF CP/SG are subject to the AF random drug testing program as a condition of employment.  All  DAF  CP/SG  applicants  will  receive  a  letter  from  the  CPO  directing  the administration  of  a  drug  test  (Condition  of  Employment  for  Certain  Civilian  Positions Identified as Sensitive Positions Under the Department of the Air Force, Drug-Free Federal Workplace Program). All applicants must pass a drug test per DoDD 1010.09, DoD Civilian Employee  Drug-Free  Workplace  Program,  before  being  hired.  (T-0)  Additionally,  drug testing may be required as a result of an accident or an unsafe practice and for employees in sensitive positions. The Head of each DoD Component determines the extent to which such employees are tested and the criteria for such testing based on the mission and its employees’ duties, the efficient use of resources, the danger to public health and safety or to U.S. national security  that  might  result  from  the  failure  of  an  employee  to  discharge  his  or  her  position adequately. 2.4.  Medical Standards. 2.4.1.  To  achieve  its  mission  of  delivering  security  services  to  protect  Air  Force  and Department of Defense (DoD) personnel and resources worldwide, the Air  Force requires a capable and physically fit DAF CP/SG work force. 2.4.1.1.  The Air Force medical examinations include: 2.4.1.2.  Pre-placement exams. 2.4.1.3.  Fitness for duty exams. 2.4.1.4.  Required periodic medical surveillance examinations and medical evaluation of workplace injury/illness. 2.4.1.5.  Chemical,  breath,  blood,  or  urine  tests  prescribed  by  AFI  31-218  (I),  Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, and existing laws. 2.4.2.  Disclosure  of  these  and  similar  medical  examinations  and  the  resulting  medical records  and  information  are  prescribed  by  AFI  41-210,  Tricare  Operations  and  Patient Administration Function, and do not fall under confidentiality requirements. 2.4.3.  Conduct  medical  evaluation  for  DAF  CP/SG  applicants  and  current  employees  in accordance with prescribed OPM and DoD 6055.05M, Occupational Medical Examinations and  Surveillance  Manual.  Applicable  federal  law  and  policy  includes  5  USC  §  3301  and  5 AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   13  CFR Part 339, Medical Qualification Determinations.  These provisions should be reviewed for informational purposes. 2.4.4.  The  DAF  CP/SG  medical  examination  program  includes  a  mandatory  medical evaluation    prior  to  performing  the  PAT,  pre-placement  medical  examination,  periodic medical examinations, and return to duty or fitness for duty examinations when the employee develops a medical condition that permanently impacts their ability to perform the essential functional and work condition elements of the position. Employees must report and provide complete and accurate medical information to the examining and reviewing physicians, and disclose any prior health issues or treatments -- including mental health issues or treatment. (T-1) A civilian doctor can perform the examination, but a Medical Review Officer (MRO) with Federal Status must review it. (T-1) 2.4.5.  The Medical Review Officer shall be a currently licensed Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or osteopathy (D.O.) assigned to the base Military Treatment Facility. (T-2) Ensure the MRO is qualified to provide professional expertise in the areas of occupational safety and health as they relate to the program and policies established under this program. 2.4.6.  Civilian  employees  at  occupational  risk  for  vaccine–preventable  disease.  In accordance  with  AFJI  48-110,  Immunizations  and  Chemoprophylaxis,  Federal  civilian employees at risk of exposure to an infectious disease associated with their occupation will receive  appropriate  immunizations  without  charge  at  military  activities.  (T-2)  Administer immunizations upon the recommendation of the responsible occupational medical authority. For  Federal  employees  in  a  bargaining  unit,  local  management  must  meet  applicable  labor relations  obligations  before  implementing  any  changes  to  the  bargaining  unit  employees’ conditions  of  employment.  (T-0)  Civilian  personnel  offices  provide  guidance  on  these matters. 2.5.  Medical Evaluation Program 2.5.1.  The  purpose  of  the  Medical  Evaluation  Program  is  to  ensure  DAF  CP/SG  personnel are  able  to  safely  perform  the  physical  fitness  and  work  condition  requirements  for  their position. 2.5.1.1.  DAF  CP/SG  personnel  will  complete  a  medical  evaluation  upon  initial employment,  on  a  periodic  basis,  and  on  termination,  if  there  is  a  reasonable  belief  the employee  was  exposed  to  a  job  related  hazardous  material  or  condition  that  could adversely  affect  the  employee’s  health.  (T-1)  Any  offer  of  employment  is  contingent upon  medical  certification  of  the  individual’s  ability  to  perform  the  essential  job functions.  Accomplish  the  initial  medical  evaluation  during  initial  pre-placement evaluation of potential selectees. 2.5.1.1.1.  Veterans must provide a (VA Certificate) as part of the application process if  they  claim  veteran’s  preference  as  a  disabled  veteran.  (T-0)  The  VA  Certificate provides eligibility for the preferential treatment by the personnel community. 2.5.1.1.2.  The  VA  Rating  Decision  is  a  critical  document  that  not  only  provides information  regarding  the  percentage  of  disabilities(s)  that  have  been  determined  to be service-connected but also provides an extensive analysis of the medical basis used to  support  the  disability  rating.  Each  veteran  who  has  been  awarded  veterans preference based on a service-connected disability  for hiring, should bring their VA   14  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 Rating Decision to all physical examinations. This should allow the medical officer to fully understand the limitations which may be placed on the individual based on the documented rationale for the disability ratings. The VA Ratings Decision form does not  challenge  the  right  to  preferential  hiring  but  merely  provides  the  AF  Medical Officer with details of the disabilities. 2.5.1.2.  Ensure  the  DAF  CP/SG  periodic  medical  evaluation  is  accomplished  at  least once every three years. The examining physician should tailor the periodic evaluation as clinically  indicated,  based  upon  risk  factors,  and  in  accordance  with  guidance  from  Air Force Surgeon General (HQ USAF/SG). Supervisors are responsible for coordinating the evaluation  of  their  personnel.  Complete  a  medical  evaluation  more  frequently  if,  in  the interim,  there  are  medical  signs  or  symptoms  suggestive  of  a  medical  condition  that might interfere with the performance of essential job functions, or at the discretion of the examining  physician.  Accomplish  continuing  medical  evaluations (including cardiovascular  evaluation)  of  DAF  CP/SG  in  accordance  with  DoD  Manual  6055.05M, Occupational  Medical  Examinations  and  Surveillance  Manual,  (See  Attachment  5). These documents assist the examining physician in identifying conditions that ordinarily might interfere with the performance of one or more essential job functions as described in (Attachment 4). 2.5.1.3.  The  MRO  may  use  individual  medical  information,  such  as  hospital  records, specialized  tests  or  an  examination  by  another  medical  specialist  to  determine  if  an individual  can  perform  the  essential  functions  of  the  job,  with  or  without  reasonable accommodation.  If  a  condition  develops  in  a  DAF  CP/SG  employee  that  permanently restricts the individual from performing the essential functional or work conditions of the position, the MRO should place the individual on appropriate restrictions until a Fitness For  Duty  determination  can  be  made  per  5  CFR  Part  339  and  DoD  6055.5-M, Occupational Medical Examinations and Surveillance Manual. Promptly advise the DFC of any medical condition that may impact the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions  of  the  job.  When  the  DFC’s  evaluation  suggests  the  employee  is  unable  to perform the essential functions of the job for a significant period, and that there is not a reasonable accommodation available, the DFC/Supervisor shall notify the servicing CPO. (T-0) The servicing CPO and the servicing legal advisor should assist the DFC with any appropriate personnel action. If the employee cannot perform in the current position, the CPO  should  look  for  a  reassignment  to  a  job  for  which  the  employee  is  qualified.  A termination  exam  may  be  considered.  Termination  exams  include  evaluations  prompted by potential work exposures or as otherwise clinically indicated. 2.5.2.  Specific  knowledge  of  the  tasks  typically  performed  and  the  conditions  under  which the tasks are performed are a crucial component necessary to render an accurate occupational medical opinion. Resources that describe police officer/security guard qualifications include, but  not  limited  to:  description  of  duties,  training  requirements,  qualifications/classification standards,  and  essential  job  tasks  (see  Attachment  4).  Use  of  the  OF  178,  Certificate  of Medical  Examination,  or  equivalent,  to  document  the  medical  provider’s  evaluation  and disposition. 2.5.3.  Initially and prior to the Physical Agility Test (PAT), a military facility physician or physician extender will complete and sign a medical certificate to verify the individual is able to  perform  the  PAT  with  minimal  risk  to  safety  and  health  (see  Attachment  3).  (T-2)  The AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   15  examining physician should check all items of medical significance necessary to accurately report  sufficient  medical  information  and  to  fully  describe  the  individual’s  current  medical condition,  including    reviewing    the    individual’s    medical    history.  The  employee  should submit  the  signed  medical  certificate  to  the  SF  unit  prior  to performing  the  PAT.  The  final approving authority is the Medical Review Officer (MRO) when there are questions. 2.5.4.  During  an  incumbent’s  medical  evaluation,  when  the  examining  physician  identifies one or more medical conditions that could interfere with the DAF CP/SG’s performance of the  essential  functional  or  work  conditions  of  the  position,  requiring  the  conducting  of  a medical  standard  disqualification  recommendation,  the  AF/A4S  appoints  an  MRO  and creates  an  Air  Force  Security  Forces  Qualifications  Review  Board  (SF-QRB)  to  make  the necessary employment-related decisions (See Attachment 8). 2.5.5.  Conduct all initial and periodic medical screening/examinations, required of applicant and  incumbent  DAF  CP/SGs  under  this  manual,  at  government  expense  in  government facilities  and  by  an  AF  designated  physician  or  physician  extender  when  possible;  all required  screening/examinations  are  subject  to  review  and  approval  by  an  AF  designated physician or physician extender. The examinations are limited to ensuring that the individual meets  established  thresholds  and  is fit  to  perform  the  duties  of  the  assigned  position.  If  the individual  does  not  meet  established  thresholds,  additional  tests,  studies  and  medical assessments  to  prove  that  the  individual  is  capable  of  safely  performing  the  full  range  of assigned essential  activities  (with  or without accommodation) are obtained at the discretion and expense of the individual. 2.6.  Position Descriptions (PDs). 2.6.1.  It is desirable that only those approved position description documents located in the SCPD  library  be  used  for  hiring  of  DAF  CP/SGs.  Generic  Standard  Core  Position Descriptions (SCPDs) for 0085 Security Guard and 0083 Police Officer Series can be found in the SCPD/SPD Library under myPers in the AF Portal. The Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) will maintain the position descriptions for their civilian police officers. 2.6.2.  DAF  CP  Combat  Arms  (CA),  Training  and  Detective  personnel  positions  should  be classified  under  the  0083  series  and  include  duties  for  both  CA/Trainer/Detective respectively  and  Police  Officer.  The  intent  is  to  provide  an  employee  who  is  first  a  Police Officer  and  second  a  CA/Detective  expert;  an  employee  with  enhanced  knowledge  and training  that  can  respond  to  Integrated  Defense  emergency  situations.  This  requirement  is intended  for  SF  unit-level  operations.  Similarly,  other  DAF  CP  positions  like  Training, Standardization  Evaluation,  Armorer,  Alarm  Monitor,  Dispatcher,  Military  Working  Dog (MWD)  Police,  VCC  and  Equipment/Resources  should  also  be  classified  under  the  0083 series. 2.6.3.  The CFM/FM should validate the use of GS-0083-12 and above SCPDs, before they are  used,  to  ensure  appropriate  and  balanced  integration  of  these  positions  into  SF  units. Submit  a  unit  organizational  chart  denoting  the position  and  a  justification  to  CFM/FM  for validation. 2.6.4.  PDs written for 0085 series relegate the position to Security Guard duties; while PDs for  the  0083  series  provide  the  flexibility  to  utilize  these  positions  in  every  functional  SF duty.    Training  standards  to  include  flightline-oriented  tasking  (e.g.  perform  SRT  member   16  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 duties, establish a temporary restricted area, tactics) for both these series are reflected in DAF CP/SG CFETP. 2.6.5.  A  prospective  employee  (applicant)  must  meet  all  conditions  of  appointment described  in  the  CONDITIONS  OF  APPOINTMENT/OTHER  SIGNIFICANT  FACTS section, usually box number 33 on the reverse side of a PD to include: 2.6.5.1.  Subject to the AF random drug testing program. 2.6.5.2.  Pass  an  initial  pre-placement  medical  examination  and  periodic  medical examinations. (T-2) 2.6.5.3.  Pass  a  required  initial  and  annual  PAT  that  includes  running  events  (See  Chap 6). (T-2) 2.6.5.4.  Meet established hearing standards and discerns colors, contrast, and depth. (T-2) 2.6.5.5.  Undergo initial job compatibility assessment. (T-2) 2.6.5.6.  Qualified  in  the  use  of  required  weapon(s).  (T-2)  To  mitigate  AF  liability  for injuries  to  potential  DAF  CP/SGs  that  could  occur  during  the  conditional  employment phase of the hiring process, applicants should conduct weapons qualification after such a person  is  accepted  as  an  AF  employee,  rather  than  during  the  conditional  employment phase. This policy measure is recommended in the legal review by the Labor Law Field Support  Center/Labor  Relations  Law  Branch.  If  an  employee  (applicant/incumbent)  is unable  to  qualify  on  the  required  weapon(s),  the  employee  can  be  removed  as  a  DAF CP/SG  as  weapons  qualification  is  a  requirement  to  perform  the  employee’s  assigned duties. 2.6.5.7.  Wear  a  uniform  and  meet  applicable  DAF  CP/SG  dress  and  appearance standards contained within this manual. (T-3) 2.6.5.8.  Subject  to  annual  duty  position  evaluation  (DPE)  on  a  pass/fail  standard  IAW AFI 36-2646.  See paragraph 5.2 for course of action upon failed DPE.  (T-2) 2.6.5.9.  Possess an automobile drivers’ license currently valid in the State in which they are domiciled or principally employed and must complete OF Form 345, as per AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operation. (T-2) 2.6.5.10.  For  Federal  employees  in  a  bargaining  unit,  local  management  should  meet applicable labor relations obligations before implementing any changes to the bargaining unit employees’ conditions of employment. 2.7.  Continued Service Agreement (CSA). 2.7.1.  A Continued Service Agreement (CSA) is an agreement by the employee to continue in service upon training completion. As a minimum, all training over 80 hours require a CSA. The period of service obligation begins the first workday after the training ends, and is equal to at least three times the length of the training. Longer periods of required service are set if justified by the costs of training or other factors, such as situations when an employee enters into  a  period  of  non-pay  status.  The  Employee  Development  Manager/Specialist  (EDM/S) evaluates each instance of training to justify an agency's substantial investment of resources. Refer to AFI 36-401, Employee Training and Development, for completion of CSA and use of Standard Form (SF) 182, Authorization, Agreement and Certification of Training. As per AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   17  AFI  36-401  AFGM1,  Employee  Training  and  Development,  Force  Development  Flights utilize the SF 182 to document all training. 2.7.2.  Both  the  Security  Guard  and  Police  Officer  courses  from  the  Veterans  Affairs  Law Enforcement Training Center (VA-LETC) fit the requirement for a CSA and completion of the  SF  182.  Additionally,  new  hires  attend  5  weeks  of  pre/post  formal  training  and  in accordance  with  AFI  36-401,  the  training  can  be  considered  toward  the  CSA.  Considering the total of local and formal training, a CSA for formal training should be for not less than 6 months. As per AFI 36-401, longer periods of required service can be set if justified by other factors.  For  locations  that  are  experiencing  difficulty  hiring  (are  below  50%),  or  where applicants receive training and are leaving for other agencies, use a 1 year period for CSA. Subsequently, if more training time is necessary, it can be factored into the obligation period. Employees  will  sign  a  CSA  (see  Attachment  6)  and  complete  an  SF  182  before commencement of training. (T-2)  Once an employee  has  signed a CSA  and an SF 182, the Employee  Development  Manager/Specialist  (typically  the  SF  Unit  Supervisor  or  Training Superintendent)  will  ensure  a  system  is  in  place  to  monitor  the  date  the  obligation  service commitment  expires,  preventing  any  separation  action  without  consideration  of  this obligation. (T-1) 2.7.2.1.  New  hire.  A  new  hire  is  defined  as  an  applicant  that  is  seeking  admission. Generally  an  applicant  has  not  been  previously  employed  by  SF  nor  has attended/completed required initial events (e.g. Formal Training, PAT-5 event test, JCA). The  DFC  can  determine  re-accomplishment  of  an  event  in  the  case  where  an  applicant has not performed law enforcement/police operation duties in the last 5-year period. 2.8.  Permanent Positions. 2.8.1.  As the Department of the Air Force Civilian Police continues to grow and permanent positions are gained to replace temporary and term positions, the permanent positions should be  Police  Officer  Series  0083,  so  the  force  structure  provides  the  same  capability  as  the military SF force. The USAF has determined that the additional capability of police officers is necessary for the defense of our personnel and resources. 2.8.2.  It is the AF’s intent to build a program that is comprised of Civilian Police Officers, GS-0083, which provide increased capability and effectiveness. To meet this intent, all new unit requests for personnel action (RPAs) will be GS-0083 series classifications. (T-1) Units should  convert  existing  Security  Guard  GS-0085  positions  to  Police  Officer  GS-0083 positions  at  the  earliest  opportunity.  SF  Units  should  ensure  bargaining  obligations  are honored  when  converting  existing  security  guard  positions  to  police  officer  positions.  Current operational type positions with the series number of 1712, 0080, etc., other than 0083 should  be  immediately  flagged  by  the  unit  at  the  local  CPO  so  that  through  attrition  those positions can be filled as 0083 series positions in the future. It is therefore SF Policy that both permanent and over hire (non-permanent positions) DAFC personnel working in operational flight  positions  will  be  Police  Officers,  Series  0083.  (T-2)  Combat  arms  instructors  should also be in the 0083 series, as per AFI 36-2654. 2.8.3.  A 0085 security guard primarily performs the duties of an installation entry controller. 2.8.4.  A 0083 police officer offers the flexibility of utilization as installation entry controller, flight line security duties, as well as installation law enforcement and ability to perform the   18  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 full spectrum of Integrated Defense duties. When a unit uses 0083 police officers, regularly rotate the officers among all certified positions. 2.8.5.  Units  should  evaluate  their  missions  to  determine  if  the  security  work  their  police officers perform directly affects “national security” and request those positions be excluded from  collective  bargaining  agreement  (CBA)  as  per  5  U.S.C.  §  7112(b)(6).  This  is accomplished by conducting a local legal review involving legal, SF and personnel advisors. It  is  then  followed  by  preparing  a  package  from  the  installation  wing  commander  to MAJCOM Manpower and Personnel (A1) validating why police officers should be excluded from a CBA. The package includes as a minimum a memo, point paper, referenced authority described  above,  current  position  description(s),  and  any  cases  with  precedent.  It  is  best  to request the CBA exemption before hiring the positions. Once exemption is granted, use the DAF  CPs  in  the  duties  directly  affecting  national  security  (e.g.,  Flightline,  Commercial Vehicle Search, LE Desk duties). 2.9.  Hiring or Working with Contract Security Personnel. 2.9.1.  If  hiring  or  working  with  contract  security  personnel  in  an  overseas  contingency operation,  refer  to  Combatant  Commander  Guidance  as  outlined  in  DoDI  3020.50,  Private Security Contractors Operating in Contingency Operations. 2.10.  Overtime. 2.10.1.  DAF CP/SG is expected to provide 24-hour SF operations mission coverage. As they prepare  for  normal  shift  operations,  police  and  security  guards  may  require  overtime  to accomplish their mission. 2.10.2.  There  are  numerous  duties,  activities  and  situations  that  may  require  the  need  for overtime. Although  not all inclusive, some of this time involves the pre-shift  and post-shift activities.  Pre-shift  activities  normally  consist  of  the  issue,  receipt,  inspection  and  function check of the security equipment. Other activities are briefings on vehicle and weapons safety, current  threat,  various  procedures  and  changes,  and  security  deficiencies/items  of  interest. These activities may be part of the unit’s guardmount. Post-shift activities include the turning in  of  all  equipment  issued  for  the  shift.  It  may  consist  of  completing  and  filing/entering reports  and  paperwork.    Routine  pre  and  post-shift  activities  are  prescribed  in  governing documents to include law enforcement/security directives and technical orders. 2.10.3.  Overtime  may  be  required  when  transporting  the  DAF  CP/SG  to  and  from  the marshalling  area  (where  the  pre  and  post-shift  activities  occur,  e.g.  Operations  Facility, armory). Base any determination of  the appropriate amount  of overtime  on the distances to and from fixed posts, amount and type of equipment being used, number and complexity of checks  required,  frequency  and  depth  of  briefings.  Additionally,  there  may  be  occasions when  an  oncoming  shift  does  not  have  sufficient  personnel  to  meet  all  mandatory  posting requirements. Obtain necessary personnel by holding over off-going shift for minimum time necessary. Units may provide appropriate amount of overtime in such cases. 2.10.4.  Overtime can easily become an excessive expense. DFCs and DAF CP/SG managers and  supervisors  should  strictly  monitor  overtime  to  ensure  that  the  appropriate  amount  and authorization  given  is  based  on  factors  associated  with  each  post.  Generally,  the  most common  time  for  a  post  requiring  in-place  changeover  is  1.417  hours  (or  85  minutes)  per shift. AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   19  2.11.  Light Duty for Officers with Medical Restrictions. 2.11.1.  Definition. Light duty status is assignment to work other than an employee’s primary duties and that does not necessarily involve performance of all essential functions. Light duty may be offered to an officer with a medical condition which temporarily restricts the officer from performance of the essential functions of the officer’s assigned position, as determined by  the  officer’s  supervisor  after  review  of  medical  evaluations.    Failure  to  pass  the  PAT indicates  an  officer  cannot  safely  and  fully  perform  the  essential  functions  of  his  or  her assigned  position.  Likewise,  the  temporary  inability  to  take  the  PAT  due  to  a  medical condition indicates the officer cannot perform the full range of duties of the position. Impose the following restrictions upon employees limited to light duty: (1) employees cannot carry a firearm,  (2)  prohibit  employee  participation  in  field  duties,  including  law  enforcement actions,  and  (3)  prohibit  employees  from  direct  contact  with  suspects  or  prisoners.  (T-3) These restrictions are necessary to ensure there is no misunderstanding that an individual on light  duty  is not  to  perform the essential job  functions of the position.  Employees on light duty  may  continue  to  wear  the  uniform  and  operate  law  enforcement  vehicles  with compliance of the above restrictions. 2.11.2.  Legal Framework. The Air Force is not required to remove an essential function of the job as a reasonable accommodation. Nor is the AF required to lower either qualitative or quantitative standards to make an accommodation. Accommodation requires the employee to still  be  qualified  for  his  or  her  position  as  a  Police  Officer  or  Security  Guard.  Under  the Rehabilitation Act/ADA, as interpreted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, how the employee became disabled (i.e., on the job vs. off duty) is not relevant to his or her right to accommodation. If the AF offers light duty to employees on worker’s compensation, then it should be available to employees with disabilities that are not work-related. Provide light  duty  to  the  extent  it  is  a  reasonable  accommodation  for  the  employee’s  medical condition,  it  is  available  within  the  SF  unit  and  is  consistent  with  mission  requirements. Temporary  assignment  to  perform  light  duty  can  include  a  range  of  technical  and administrative  areas  that  include  the  following:  (1)  administrative  functions  (e.g.,  report review, special projects), (2) clerical or custodial functions (e.g., filing, local area clean-up), (3)  report  taking  (e.g.,  telephone  reports),  (4)  duty  in  a  visitor  control  center  that  does  not involve  emergency  response  in  support  of  other  posts  (e.g.,  gate  back-up,  over-watch).  If light  duty  is  not  available  within  the  Security  Forces  unit,  then  determine  the  available personnel  options  through  coordination  with  the  civilian  personnel  office.  SF  leadership should  read  and  be  aware  of  provisions  in  Chapter  6  of  AFI  36-2706,  Equal  Opportunity Program, Military and Civilian. is  a to  a  new  position 2.11.3.  Reassignment  Policy.  Reassignment reasonable accommodation  if  no  other  option  exists  to  permit  the  employee  with  a  duty  limiting condition  to  perform  the  essential  functions  of  the  current  position  of  police  officer  or security guard. Coordinate any reassignment with the civilian personnel office. Units are not required  to  create  new  positions  or  to  move  employees  from  their  jobs  in  order  to  create  a vacancy. If no vacant position is available in the Security Forces unit, then conduct a search across the installation and, if needed, AF-wide to places the employee is willing to move at his  or  her  own  expense.  The  employee  should  be  in  a  permanent  position  to  warrant reassignment. The servicing civilian personnel office should process all reassignment actions to  ensure  actions  are  processed  according  to  legal  requirements.  Ensure  the  employee  is   20  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 qualified  for  the  position  and  the  position  is  vacant.  The  placement  of  disabled  employees anywhere  within  DoD  to  a  position  at  the  same  or  lower  grade  for  which  he  or  she  can  be reasonably  accommodated  (29  CFR  1614.203)  is  an  exception  to  the  Priority  Placement Program (PPP). 2.11.4.  Application  for  Light  Duty.  If  an  employee  is  temporarily  unable  to  perform  the essential functions of the position (including performance of the PAT), he/she must provide documentation from a licensed health care professional (i.e., physician, physician extender). (T-3)  Medical  documentation  provided  from  outside  health  care  professionals  containing protected health information regarding diagnosis and/or treatment should be sent only to the AF  medical  provider.  Limit  documentation,  from  outside  providers  sent  directly  to  the employee’s supervisor, solely to recommendation(s) for duty limitations. This documentation should indicate the existence of a  medical  condition,  the recommended  restrictions to work activities required because of that condition, the recommended duration of those restrictions, and  the  date,  signature  and  contact  information  for  the  recommending  provider.  The employee’s supervisor should review the duty limitations with the assistance of AF medical personnel to  ensure  there  is  a  full  understanding  of  the  nature  of  the  documented  disability and  the  recommended  accommodation.  HIPAA  and  Privacy  Act  directives  are  observed  by supervisors. If an employee needs an accommodation, he or she brings the request to his or her  supervisor.  In  addition,  SF  management  personnel  may  request  an  evaluation  of  an employee  by  AF  medical  personnel  if  medical  limitation  interferes  with  successful  job performance.  Submit  requests  for  employee  assignment  to  light  duty  to  the  Defense  Force Commander  (or  equivalent),  with  recommendations  from  the  first  and  second  level supervisors. Allocate temporary light duty workloads on a first come first serve basis; may be made  rotational  if  more  personnel  are  on  light  duty  status  than  positions  are  available.  For example,  if  a  unit  determines  that  there  are  8  hours  per  day  of  light  duty  work,  and  two employees  are  in  a  light  duty  status,  then  the  employees  may  rotate  to  accomplish  the workloads.  Collective  bargaining  agreements  can  be  a  means  to  establish  how  light  duty work is distributed. 2.11.5.  Conditions  lasting  longer  than  30  days.  Employee  must  provide  a  new  health  care provider note (as described above) at least once each month, where the employee’s condition can reasonably be expected to change within the month, to confirm the recommended work limitations  are  still  applicable  and  related  to  the  initial  medical  condition,  and  give  an estimated  date  of  recovery  or  achievement  of  maximum  medical  improvement.  (T-3)  Light duty  as  a  reasonable  accommodation  will  be  offered  for  the  same  duration  as  light  duty  is made  available  for  individuals  on  worker’s  compensation.  Process  and  grant  concurrently, light  duty  under  worker’s  compensation  (where  applicable)  and  as  a  reasonable accommodation  under  the  Rehabilitation  Act/ADA.  Consider  alternate  accommodations where  both  employee  and  SF  agree  or  where  the  alternative  accommodation  is  equally effective in allowing the employee to perform the essential functions of his or her position. 2.11.6.  Return  from  Light  Duty.  An  employee  wishing  to  return  to  regular  duty  from  light duty will submit a request to the Defense Force Commander (DFC) (or equivalent/designee), with recommendations from the first and second level supervisors. (T-3) The request should contain medical documentation of the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions of the  position,  with  or  without  reasonable  accommodation.  The  commander  will  coordinate AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   21  with the civilian personnel office and ensure the medical documentation is reviewed by Air Force medical personnel. 2.12.  Stand-by. 2.12.1.  Before assigning DAF CP/SG to stand-by duty, the DFC or SF representative should consult  with  Labor  Relations  Officer  and/or  the  Judge  Advocate’s  office  to  ensure  correct assignment and release. It is necessary to follow this procedure so the DFC/SF representative obtains expert and legal advice before assigning DAF CP/SG personnel to stand-by duty. 2.13.  Use of Force (UoF) Incidents. 2.13.1.  DAF CP/SG may seek assistance from the local CPO/Medical Facility with regards to  mental  care  following  a  Use  of  Force  incident.  All  other  services  for  assistance  are available  upon  request.  SF  Units  should  develop  standard  operating  procedures  to  address assistance  to  be  provided  to  DAF  CP/SGs  when  involved  in  a  UoF  situation.  Weingarten Rights--under Federal law, employees who are members of a recognized bargaining unit are given  certain  statutory  rights.  One  of  these  rights  specifically  impacts  upon  the  manner  in which  SF  may  conduct  an  investigation.    Refer  to  AFI  31-118,  Security  Forces  Standards and Procedures, for additional information on the Weingarten Rights.   22  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 Chapter 3 AUTHORITY OF DEPARTMENT OF AIR FORCE CIVILIAN POLICE/SECURITY GUARD 3.1.  General. 3.1.1.  This chapter prescribes the authority of DAF CP/SGs performing law enforcement or security  functions  on  Air  Force  installation/activities.  DoDI  5200.08,  Security  of  DoD Installations and Resources and the DOD Physical Security Board (PSRB), 50 USC § 797, and Section 21 of the Internal Security Act of 1950, requires DoD installation commanders to take  reasonably  necessary  and  lawful  measures  to  maintain  law  and  order  to  protect installation personnel and property. Based on this authority, the installation commander has the authority to direct law enforcement and security activities on his/her installation. 3.2.  DAF CP/SG Authority. 3.2.1.  The  DAF  CP/SG  personnel  performing  law  enforcement  and  security  duties authorized  by  the  installation  commander  may  apprehend  any  persons  found  on  the installation for offenses committed on base that are felonies, misdemeanors, breaches of the peace,  a  threat  to  property  or  welfare,  or  detrimental  to  good  order  and  discipline.  Such apprehension  authority  is  limited  to  issuing  citations  and  turning  the  subject  over  to  the appropriate civilian or military authorities. 3.2.1.1.  On  duty  DAF  CP/SG  personnel  are  considered  part  of  the  DAF,  therefore,  are subject to the restrictions on aid to civilian law enforcement imposed by Title 18 USC § 1385,  commonly  known  as  the  Posse  Comitatus  Act.  Accordingly,  the  servicing  SJA must review any proposed aid to civilian law enforcement. (T-3) 3.2.1.2.  DAF  SG  authority  and  jurisdiction  to  perform  force  protection  tasks  on  their installation are valid while performing these duties during their work hours only. An on-base  apprehension  conducted  by  a  DAF  SG  in  an  off-duty  status  is  a  detention  by  a private  citizen.  DAF  SGs  will  not  carry  AF  weapons  while  off  duty  and  they  are  not authorized  to  store  AF  weapons  at  a  private  residence.  (T-3)  Store  AF  weapons  in  an authorized  storage  facility  in  accordance  with  AFI  31-101,  Integrated  Defense.  AF security guards while on duty will not carry privately-owned weapons or privately-owned ammunition. (T-3) Off-duty SGs, like any military or civilian member, should adhere to established policy of the installation commander when carrying privately-owned weapons on base. 3.2.1.3.  DAF  CP  authority  and  jurisdiction  to  perform  law  enforcement  tasks  are  valid while  performing  these  duties  during  their  work  hours  only.  An  on-base  apprehension conducted by DAF CP in an off-duty status is a detention by a private citizen. DAF CP will  not  carry  AF  weapons  while  off  duty  and  they  are  not  authorized  to  store  AF weapons  at  a  private  residence.  (T-3)  Ensure  AF  weapons  are  stored  in  an  authorized storage facility in accordance with AFI 31-101. Do not carry AF weapons on a standby basis. DAF CP while on duty will not carry privately-owned weapons or privately-owned ammunition.  (T-3)  Regardless  of  the  activity,  CPs  should  only  carry  privately-owned weapons on the installation IAW Wing instructions. AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   23  3.3.  Posse Comitatus Act. 3.3.1.  Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 (18 USC §1385).  The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the direct, active participation of military forces to execute civilian laws.  Also see 10 U.S.C., § 375.  This Act applies to both SF military members and DAF CP/SG. 3.3.2.  This act prevents military personnel from executing the laws of the states or the laws of the United States except when acting under the authority of the US Constitution, an Act of Congress,  and  under  the  direction  of  the  President  of  the  United  States.    Posse  Comitatus governs the use of military personnel only within the Continental United States (CONUS) to include  Alaska,  Hawaii  and  the  US  Territories.  The  Act  does  not  apply  to  National  Guard personnel performing in Title 32 status under the command of a State governor. 3.3.3.  There  are  statutory  exceptions  to  the  Posse  Comitatus  Act  which  authorize  specific types  of  military  support  to  law  enforcement.  As  appropriate,  consult  with  the  installation SJA prior to engaging in any support activities. 3.4.  Deputizing  of  Air  Force  Law  Enforcement  Personnel  by  State  and  Local Governments. 3.4.1.  Per AFI 31-118, the Secretary of the Air Force is the approval authority for deputizing by state and local governments of uniformed law enforcement personnel under the authority of the Air Force, including SF, civilian police, and/or security guards. 3.4.1.1.  If  state  or  local  deputizing  is  needed,  the  senior  installation  law  enforcement official  will  prepare  the  request.  (T-3)  Base  the  request  on  the  justification  guidelines established  in  DoDI  5525.13,  Limitation  of  Authority  to  Deputize  DoD  Uniformed  Law Enforcement Personnel by State and Local Governments, and ensure it include: 3.4.1.2.  The number of uniformed law enforcement personnel to be granted the authority and  a  certification  that  they  have  received  the  requisite  training  to  affect  the  type  of deputizing. 3.4.1.3.  The  time  frame  envisioned  for  the  authority  to  be  exercised.  Do  not  consider blanket time authorizations. 3.4.1.4.  The  policies  and  procedures  to  prevent  misuse  of  the  authority  to  be  employed by the requesting installation law enforcement official. 3.4.1.5.  A  copy  of  the  proposed  memorandum  of  understanding  with  the  state  or  local jurisdiction that carries out deputizing, to include the signature of the appropriate official representing that state or local jurisdiction. 3.4.2.  Requests  for  approval  should  follow  the  appropriate  chain  of  command  to  the Secretary of the Air Force for approval. The request may be disapproved at any level. As a minimum, coordinate requests through the following: 3.4.2.1.  Installation Commander 3.4.2.2.  Major Command (MAJCOM) Chief of Security Forces (A4S) 3.4.2.3.  Commander, Air Force Security Forces Center 3.4.2.4.  HAF/A4S Director of Security Forces   24  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 3.4.2.5.  AF/JA 3.4.2.6.  SAF/GC 3.4.2.7.  SAF/IG 3.4.3.  The  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  should  consider  the  request  and  return  a  decision through appropriate channels. 3.5.  Authority  to  Deputize  DoD  Uniformed  Law  Enforcement  Personnel  by  State  and Local Governments. 3.5.1.  Because of potential conflicts of interest, it is Air Force policy that DAF CP/SGs may not act in a deputized capacity or exercise any additional authority or jurisdiction granted by local, state, or  Federal governments to  perform law enforcement duties on or  off a  military installation or facility while wearing the duty uniform and/or badge. 3.5.2.  In  accordance  with  DoDI  5525.13,  Limitation  of  Authority  to  Deputize  DoD Uniformed Law  Enforcement  Personnel  by  State  and  Local Governments,  paragraph  8,  any existing  cases  of  deputized  Air  Force  uniformed  law  enforcement  personnel  by  state  and local governments that have not been approved by the Secretary of the Air Force are invalid. Any  existing  cases  should  not  be  grandfathered  where  those  cases  do  not  have  approval  of the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  as  per  DoDI  5525.13,  paragraph  4.3.  Cases  involving  the exercise  of  law  enforcement  powers  off  the  military  installation  on  non-military  affiliated personnel are tantamount to deputizing and require the legal review as per this manual. 3.5.3.  Submit requests for an exception to this prohibition in accordance with DoDI 5525.13, as described in paragraph 3.4 above. The approval authority is the Secretary of the Air Force. 3.5.4.  This  prohibition  does  not  apply  to  DAF  CP/SG  employed  while  off  duty  by  local, state, or Federal governments. 3.6.  Identification. 3.6.1.  DAF  CP/SGs  are  issued  a  standardized  identification  DoD  Common  Access  Card (CAC) which is the official identification. The duty uniform and DAF CP/SG badge are other identification uniform items that may only be worn while on duty or while traveling to and from  work  as  determined by the DFC. While wearing the duty  uniform and badge, civilian police  officers/security  guards  may  intervene  to  perform  law  enforcement  tasks  on  their installation only. Management and executive level 0083 personnel do not wear or display the DAF  CP  badge  on  a  regular  basis.  For  these  positions  only  display  the  badge  in  specific environments  where  appropriate  to  enhance  esprit  de  corps,  camaraderie  and  professional pride in the Air Force police profession. Acceptable circumstances where the badge may be displayed are official ceremonies, graduations, professional police conferences and where it is customary and widely practiced to display police affiliation and the member is attending in an official capacity. 3.7.  Law Enforcement Officer Safety Act (LEOSA). 3.7.1.  Under  the  Law  Enforcement  Officer  Safety  Act  (LEOSA),  a  Qualified  Law Enforcement Officer’s (QLEO) Credential that indicates them as such enables the QLEO to carry  a  concealed  firearm  while  off  duty  and  off  the  installation;  and  LEOSA  provides exemption  from  state  laws  prohibiting  the  carrying  of  concealed  firearms.  Note:  DAF  CP AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   25  members  need  to  ensure  they  are  knowledgeable  and  in  compliance  with  state  and  Federal laws with regards to concealed carry. The LEOSA Credential does not grant any authority to act  on  the  agency’s  behalf  or  to  exercise  any  law  enforcement  authority.  DAF  CP  need  to read and be familiar with DoDI 5525.12, Implementation of the Amended Law Enforcement Officers  Safety  Act  of  2004  (LEOSA),  AFMAN  31-125,  Security  Forces  Implementation  of the  Law  Enforcement  Officers  Safety  Act,  and  all  other  related  information.  The  LEOSA Credential will NOT be used as the official DAF CP identification. 3.8.  OCONUS. 3.8.1.  When  applicable,  the  authority  and  liability  of  DAF  CP/SGs  overseas  depends  on applicable  international  agreements,  Status  of  Forces  Agreement,  and  local  law.  Seek  the advice of OCONUS SJA regarding the status of such personnel. 3.9.  Written Instructions. 3.9.1.  Delegation of authority for DAF CP/SGs to perform their duties should be directed to the Installation DFC. The DFC’s responsibility includes the selection, employment, training, certification,  management,  and  supervision  of  DAF  CP/SG  personnel;  the  issuance  of standing  operating  procedures  (SOPs)  which  define  the  scope  of  their  authority  (persons, places, and offenses within their security enforcement jurisdiction); and the establishment  of  written  procedures  for  notifying  each DAF CP/SG of the extent of their authority (specific empowerment  and  limitations)  as  described  above,  and  procedures  for  suspending  and withdrawing  their  security  enforcement  authority.  The  DFC  should  coordinate  all  policies and  procedures  concerning  authority  and  jurisdiction  with  the  installation  Staff  Judge Advocate. Review all such policies and procedure at least every two years for adequacy and legal sufficiency. In addition, establish procedures to ensure each DAF CP/SG acknowledges in  writing,  a  clear  understanding  of  their  authority  and  jurisdiction  (See  Attachment  2). Review written instructions at least once a year and update if necessary. Because of potential conflicts  of  interest  and  Posse  Comitatus  Act  issues,  DAF  CP/SGs  while  wearing  the  duty uniform  and/or  badge,  may  not  be  deputized  or  exercise  any  additional  authority  and jurisdiction other than that given by the installation commander/unit DFC while on duty. This consideration includes the Secretary of the Air Force exception for deputizing, as per DoDI 5525.13.   26  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 Chapter 4 UNIFORMS FOR CIVILIAN POLICE AND GUARDS 4.1.  Covered Employees. 4.1.1.  The content of this chapter applies to any civilian employed as DAF CP/SG by the Air Force.  EXCEPTION:  Optional  for  any  police  or  guard  employee  whose  primary  duty requires them to serve in the field of investigation, subject to the approval of the DFC. 4.2.  Purpose of the Uniform. 4.2.1.  Employees should wear the prescribed duty uniform for the purpose of identification and as evidence of authority. 4.3.  Uniform Allowances for DAF CP/SG. 4.3.1.  Initial  Allowance.  As  per  DoDI  1400.25,  Vol  591,  DoD  Civilian  Personnel Management  System:  Uniform  Allowance  Rates  for  DoD  Civilian  Employees,  para  4.e.  and 4.c., states the authorization of payment for an initial allowance in the amount of $1,800.00 or a lower initial allowance equal to the cost of the uniform, whichever is less. DoDI 1400.25 authorizes  DAF  civilian  police  $1,800.00  for  initial  allowance.  DoDI  1400.25  authorizes DAF  security  guards  $800.00  for  initial  allowance.  Review  these  amounts  annually  with installation level inputs and may receive adjustments based upon inflation, revision and etc. Discontinue  the  reviews  in  the  event  the  allowance  amount  reaches  the  cap.  In  lieu  of  an initial allowance, the unit will furnish the DAF CP or SG an initial clothing issue. (T-3) All uniform  items  required  are  covered  as  part  of  the  uniform  allowance. Executive  level  staff, management and other 0083 personnel who wear civilian attire are not authorized a uniform allowance.  Where  an  existing  CBA  specifies  uniform  standards  different  from  those identified in AF Manual 31-122, DFCs should ensure the future rewrite of the CBA complies with this manual and supplement(s). 4.3.2.  Replacement  Allowance.  DAF  CP/SG  personnel  who  have  completed  one  year  of service IAW DoDI 1400.25 may receive an $800.00 annual uniform replacement allowance, or  a  lesser  allowance  equal  to  the  cost  of  the  uniform,  whichever  is  less.    In  lieu  of  an allowance,  the  unit  may  annually  furnish  the  DAF  CP/SG  with  a  replacement  uniform.  AFRC authorizes an annual allowance not to exceed $800 per year, or equal to the cost of the uniform. 4.4.  Required/Prohibition of Wearing the DAF CP/SG Uniform. 4.4.1.  All personnel should wear the DAF CP/SG standard uniform when on duty unless an exception  is  granted  for  wear  of  civilian  clothes  for  mission  reasons  as  determined  by  the DFC.  All  service  uniform  combinations  are  authorized  for  year-round  wear.  However,  use appropriate  discretion  based  on  weather  conditions  and  duties.  Installation  Commander  or DFC  may  authorize  DAF  CP/SG  the  wear  of  an  alternate  light  blue  color  shirt  for extreme hot climatic conditions, but only for the period of the extreme conditions.  The alternate shirt should  meet  same  standards  of  the  duty  shirt.  Unless  specifically  prohibited,  installation  or DFCs  may  authorize  DAF  CP/SG  to  continue  to  wear  uniform  items  changed  in  design  or material as long as the item remains in serviceable condition. The uniform item can be worn up until the date the item is phased out. AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   27  4.4.1.1.  The  DAF  CP/SG  uniforms  are  prohibited  for  wear  while  off  duty,  except  in transit to or from duty. The DAF CP/SGs are specifically prohibited from wearing their uniform under the following circumstances: 4.4.1.2.  In  connection  with  the  furtherance  of  any  political  activities  or  commercial interests or when engaged in off-duty civilian employment. 4.4.1.3.  When  participating  in  public  speeches,  interviews,  picket  lines,  marches  or rallies, or in any public demonstration unless there is written authority that the Air Force sanctions the cause for which the activity is being conducted (e.g. a welcome home rally off the installation for returning troops). 4.4.1.4.  When attending any meeting or event which is a function of, or is sponsored by, an extremist organization. 4.4.1.5.  When participating in civilian court proceedings unless serving as a government witness. 4.4.1.6.  When traveling in a foreign country. 4.4.1.7.  When wearing the uniform would bring discredit upon the Air Force. 4.4.1.8.  Unless  specifically  authorized  by  this  manual,  do  not  wear  uniform  pieces  as part  of  civilian  attire.  For  example:  cap  devices,  badges  and  other  U.S.  or  Air  Force insignia  and/or  distinctive  buttons.  Exception:  Tie  Tacks  and  lapel  pins  when  wearing civilian business attire are authorized. 4.4.1.9.  In  accordance  with  the  Joint  Ethics  Regulation,  DoD  5500.7-R,  DAF  CP/SG employees are prohibited from attending events sponsored by non-Federal entities in their official DoD capacities at Federal Government expense. 4.4.2.  Wear headgear  with the DAF CP/SG uniform unless  it would interfere with  the safe operation  of  vehicles.  Headgear  is  required  while  on  duty  at  all  installation  entry  control points and when in constant contact with the public.  Headgear is optional when performing patrol duties. The wearing of DAF CP/SG headgear is not required while in or on a privately-owned  vehicle  (including  a  motorcycle  or  bicycle),  commercial  vehicle,  or  public conveyance (for example, subway, train, plane, or bus). 4.4.3.  Employees may not wear articles of the primary duty uniform with the utility uniform and  vice  versa  unless  specifically  authorized.  Employees  may  purchase  and  wear  approved optional  items  addressed  by  this  directive  when  authorized  by  DFCs.  Employees  should procure sufficient quantities of uniform articles to allow time for garments to be cleaned or laundered, and for making any emergency change in uniform that may be required. 4.4.4.  For  OCO  converted  positions  use  code  ‘7C’  when  purchasing  uniforms.  For permanent positions, use the unit funding code. 4.5.  Protective/Reflective and Foul Weather Clothing and Equipment. 4.5.1.  As per DoDI 1400.25, the authorized management official should require the wear of uniform  items  after  a  determination  has  been  made  that  the  nature  of  their  work  makes  the wearing of a uniform necessary. Obtain protective clothing and equipment such as reflective clothing/equipment,  safety  goggles,  safety  shoes,  hearing  protection,  bullet  resistant  vests, helmet and respiratory protection for escape purposes through supply channels according to   28  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 applicable  regulations  or  instructions.    Employees  will  wear  protective  clothing  and equipment according to the policies set by the installation commander/DFC. (T-3) 4.6.  Uniform Composition. 4.6.1.  The uniforms for male and female to include maternity wear for police and guards are similar in material, design, and color. Uniform material blend (weight) should match. 4.7.  Procuring Uniforms. 4.7.1.  Employees should procure the prescribed primary duty uniforms [minimum of three] and  utility  uniforms  [minimum  of  two]  as  soon  as  possible  upon  getting  hired  and  after receiving their initial uniform allowance. SF units may procure the uniforms for new hires in lieu  of  a  uniform  allowance  if  the  DFC  elects  that  process.  Applicants  should  wear conservative civilian attire, (e.g. business casual) and attend unit training or work doing tasks out of public view, until receipt of uniform. 4.8.  Primary Duty Uniform. 4.8.1.  Employees  wear  this  uniform  as  their  primary  uniform  when  performing  duties requiring interaction with general public, such as installation entry control point, installation law enforcement duties, formal gatherings, etc. (See Fig 4.1). 4.8.2.  Shirt,  Long  Sleeved.  The  long  sleeve  shirt  should  be  dark  navy  blue  with  epaulets, military  creases,  badge  tab,  two-button  cuff  closures,  pleated  pockets  and  scalloped  pocket flaps. Wear shoulder patches (see fig 4.8) on both sleeves of the shirt, sewn onto the sleeve, one  half  inch  (½")  below  and  centered  on  the  shoulder  seam.  Wear  police  or  guard  badge (see fig 4.9) on the standard badge tab over the left breast pocket. Wear this uniform with the shirt tucked into the trousers so the shirt button edge is aligned with the front of the zipper opening and the outside of the belt buckle forming a straight “gig” line. 4.8.3.  Shirt,  Short  Sleeved.  The  short  sleeve  shirt  should  be  dark  navy  blue  with  epaulets, military  creases,  badge  tab,  pleated  pockets  and  scalloped  pocket  flaps.  Wear  shoulder patches  on  both  sleeves  of  the  shirt,  sewn  onto  the  sleeve,  one  half  inch  (½")  below  and centered on the shoulder seam. Wear police or guard badge on the standard badge tab over the  left  breast  pocket. Wear  this  uniform  with  the  shirt  tucked  into  the  trousers  so  the  shirt button edge is aligned with the front of the zipper opening and the outside of the belt buckle forming a straight “gig” line. 4.8.4.  Pants.  The  pants  for  the  primary  uniform  should  be  dark  navy  blue,  straight  leg,  no cuff, or  cargo pockets. Front of trouser legs should  rest  on the front of shoe  or  boot  with  a slight break in the crease. Back of trouser legs should be approximately 7/8 inch longer than the  front  of  the  trousers.  Do  not  blouse  pants  when  worn  with  the  primary  duty  uniform. Wear pants with a belt and properly positioned on the hips. 4.8.5.  Primary Duty Uniform Wear.

The rank insignia worn by DAF CP/SG is full size (Pentagon Police type) insignia of silver oak leaf (Director, GS-12 thru 14) and gold oak leaf (Deputy Director, GS-12 thru 14).  It also consists of double silver bars (Deputy Chief or Assistant/Operations Officer, GS-11 thru 13) and single gold bar (unit’s Lead Officer/Superintendent equivalent, GS-9  thru  11)  for  personnel  in  commensurate  positions  (see  Figures  4.2.  and  4.3.)  The previous chevron insignia of three and two chevron continues to be used by personnel in the commensurate  positions.  GS-08  police  officers  wear  three  chevrons  and  GS-07  police officers wear two chevrons (see Figure 4.4). The GS-08 police officer with three chevrons is equivalent to a shift/flight  chief supervisor and the GS-07 police  officer is  equivalent  to  an area supervisor or similar position.  Entry level GS-07 police officers may not wear the two chevron insignia until they have completed 24 months of service in that position. 4.9.2.1.  The  silver  oak  leaf  and  two  bar  insignia  is  metallic,  made  of  polished  nickel finish.  The  gold  oak  leaf  and  single  bar  insignia  is  a  metallic  gold  color  insignia.  The insignia  is  worn  on  BOTH  collars.  When  embroidered  or  sewn  on,  collar  insignia  and chevrons are made of silver/gray and gold thread. Wear chevrons/insignia 1 inch up and centered  with  bottoms  parallel  with  the  collar  point.  Police  Officers  are  addressed  as “Police Officer” and Security Guards as “Security Guard”, (personnel are not addressed by military titles (Major, Captain, Lieutenant, Sergeant, Corporal). 4.9.2.2.  In  an  integrated  SF  unit  organizational  structure,  the  Deputy  Director  is  the civilian  next-in-line  to  the  DFC;  the  Deputy  Chief/Assistant  Operations  Officer  is  the civilian  second  to  the  Operations  Officer;  and  the  DAFC  Lead  Supervisor(s)  are  the civilians second to  the Superintendent.  This applies to all other similar positions. These DAFC  positions  are  second  to  their  active  duty  (military)  equivalents,  regardless  of  the collar insignia they wear. In units with a Deputy Chief/Assistant Operations Officer and in  the absence  or deployment of the DFC, the next  senior military officer, normally  the Operations  Officer,  exercises  military  command  of  the  unit  per  AFI  38-101,  Air  Force Organization.  (T-3) 4.9.2.3.  DAF CP/SG Rank insignia cannot be superior to that of their military supervisor. (i.e., a GS-12 assistant operations officer  would not  wear  Captain  style rank when their military  operations  officer  is  a  Lieutenant.)    Silver  oak  leaf  (Director)  insignia  is  used only when a DAF CP officer is serving as the permanent DFC and the size/mission of the organization  justifies  a  military  commander  in  the  rank  of  Lieutenant  Colonel.  Wear  of silver  oak  leaf  (Lt  Col  equivalent)  is  authorized  when  approved  in  writing  by  HQ AF/A4S Functional Manager or designee. SF units are required to meet applicable labor relations  obligations  of the  respective  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  when implementing the use of the rank insignia. AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   31  Figure 4.2.

SF AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   43  units will develop a process to account for all DAF CP/SG badges using the numerical badge system. (T-3) 4.32.2.1.  As per DoDI 5525.14, DoD Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs)Flying Armed, to transfer  inmates  to  another  confinement  location  (upon  direction  of  AFIMSC/PSU AFSFC  /SFC)  on  commercial  aircraft,  the  mission  may  require  the  SF  escort  to  fly armed. The DFC can authorize an armed SF member the unique and specific use of the DAF civilian police badge. The badge can only be used in a credential holder while the escort  is  under  travel  orders  to  transport  a  confinee.  Further,  the  confinement  officer  or DFC will account for the credential wallet, AF Form 688c,  Armed Transfer Agent, with DAF civilian police or SF badge. (T-3) Upon return from an armed transfer mission, the confinement  officer  or  DFC  should  re-secure  the  credential  wallet,  AF  Form  688c,  and DAF  civilian  police  badge  in  either  a  locked  drawer  or  cabinet.  At  no  time  should  the escort  have  the  issued  credential/badge  when  they  are  not  engaged  in  confinee  escort duties. 4.32.3.  The  following  guidelines  apply  to  the issue  and  wear  of  the  civilian  police/security guard badge: 4.32.3.1.  Issue  metallic  shields  IAW  Allowance  Standard  (016)  for  Clothing  and Equipment. 4.32.3.2.  Use  AF  Form  538,  Personal  Clothing  and  Equipment  Record,  or  a  similar automated product, to record badge issues. 4.32.3.3.  Upon retirement or termination of the bearer, the badge is retrieved by the unit. 4.32.3.4.  Reissue serviceable badges turned in by personnel who have separated. 4.32.3.5.  Wear  the  metallic  badge  only  on  the  outer  most  garment,  primary  shirt  or jacket. 4.32.3.6.  Do  not  wear  or  carry  the  badge  while  in  civilian  clothes  except  as  authorized for civilian police investigators performing official duties. 4.32.4.  DAF  Civilian  Police/Security  Guard  who  are  retraining  or  separating  from  the service turn in their civilian police badge to the badge issuing activity. The DFC may elect to present the badge to retiring civilian police/guard or the next of kin to civilian police/guard who passed away while employed by the unit. 4.32.5.  The Law Enforcement Qualification Badge issued to active duty SF members is not authorized for wear by civilian police/security guards. 4.33.  General Equipment. 4.33.1.  DFCs should make the same equipment item requirement purchases for DAF CP/SG as they make for active duty personnel. When feasible, the color of items purchased for DAF CP/SGs  should  be  dark  navy  or  black  to  complement  the  uniform  and  maintain standardization. 4.34.  Uniform Procurement. 4.34.1.  Follow  SFS  Unit  specific  procurement  procedures  for  civilian  police  uniform  item purchases.  Only  the  items  listed  above  are  authorized  for  DAF  CP/SG  wear.  If  questions   44  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 arise  with  regard  to  uniform  issues  that  cannot  be  answered  by  the  DFC,  contact AFIMSC/PSU AFSFC, DAF CP/SG Program Manager. AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   45  Chapter 5 CIVILIAN POLICE/GUARD TRAINING AND EVALUATION 5.1.  General Information. 5.1.1.  Standardized training, certification, evaluation and perpetual updating are the apex to a  professional  police  training  program.  DAF  CP/SG  will  attend  the  formal  basic  law enforcement/security guard or approved equivalent school (Designated by the CFM) to earn formal basic law enforcement/security guard training credit. (T-2) Each unit training section will  complete  the  local  pre  and  post  formal  home  station  training  when  scheduling  a  DAF CP/SG  to  attend  the  formal  basic  police  officer/security  guard  course.  (T-2)  Use  the  DAF CP/SG CFETP and SF Home Station Training (HST) Program for the local pre/post training. 5.1.2.  Minimum  training  standards  for  DAF  CP/SG  were  established  by  the  DoD  CP/SG Training  Standards  Working  Group  and  can  be  found  in  DoDI  5525.15,  LE  Standards  and Training  in  the  DoD.  These  standards  serve  as  minimum  training  standards  for  all  DAF CP/SG.  The  training  standards  can  be  found  in  the  DAF  CP/SG  CFETP  and  the  HST consolidated table. Exception:  HQ AF/A4S  must individually approve any  modifications  to these  training  standards  for  staff  level  management  and  executive  level  0083  positions  and document in the individual employee training record. Career Development Course (CDC) e-enrollment by DAF CP/SG is available for use by DAF CP/SG and is highly recommended. Understanding  all  aspects  of  SF  operations,  including  unique  military  employment  tasks, helps  civilian  employees  recognize  the  challenges  of  their  military  SF  counterparts.  It  also helps civilian employees consider all aspects of complex integrated defense procedures that could  be  encountered  in  a  crisis  and  generally  improves  civilian  supervision  of  military personnel.  SF  unit  leadership  should  encourage  completion  of  the  CDCs  by  SF  civilians, especially those interested in advancement. 5.2.  Unit Training Sections. 5.2.1.  Unit  training  sections  should  use  the  minimum  training  standards  found  in  the  HST and  CFETP  to  establish  a  DAF  CP/SG  Standardization  and  Evaluation  (stan/eval)  Program using the existing active duty training program as a guide. The program should require each DAF CP/SG to receive training and certification followed by a Duty Position Evaluation(s) IAW AFI  36-2646. When mission dictates, DAF CP/SG  may be certified in more than one position.  When  an  individual  fails  a  DPE,  the  S-3/Operations  Officer  and  S-3/Operations Superintendent the recommendations from the individual’s immediate chain of command. The employee can be removed  as  DAF  CP/SG  since  passing  the  duty  position  evaluation  is  a  requirement  in  the position  description  and  a  condition  of  employment.  Brief  the  DFC  on  the  failure  and  the recommended course of action. requirements  based  on training should  determine remedial 5.2.1.1.  DAF  CP/SG  must  successfully  complete  their  assigned  unit’s  standardized training  program  which  should  include  initial  training,  certification,  evaluation  and sustainment/recurring  training  requirements  IAW  AFI  36-2646.  (T-3)  Maintain  training records per AFI 36-2646 and AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at in the   46  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 Air  Force  Records  Information  Management  System  (AFRIMS).  Document  training requirements using AFTRs first and when not possible utilize the following forms: 5.2.1.2.  AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, to document safety training. 5.2.1.3.  AF  Form  522,  AF  Form  522,  USAF  Ground  Weapons  Training  Data,  to document individual weapons training. 5.2.1.4.  AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder, to record individual training. AF  Form    623a,    On-The-Job    Training    Record-Continuation    Sheet,    to    record supplementary information in individual training records. 5.2.1.5.  AF  Form  797,  Job  Qualification  Standard  Continuation/Command  JQS,  to document qualification training. 5.2.1.6.  AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, to document SF recurring and sustainment training. 5.2.1.6.1.  All electronic forms generated by AFTR. 5.2.1.6.2.  When using the above forms for training documentation ensure you upload the documented training into AFTR at the earliest possible date. 5.2.2.  Qualify with assigned weapons. Train IAW AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel. AFI 31-117, states that DoD military, civilian, and contract personnel performing  law  enforcement,  security  or  force  protection  duties  or  personnel  serving  in  an AFSC that specifies qualification to bear firearms as a mandatory requirement IAW AFI 36-2654,  Combat  Arms  Program,  or  as  identified  in  the  Air  Force  Officer  Classification Directory  (AFOCD)  or  Air  Force  Enlisted  Classification  Directory  (AFECD).  Group  “A” personnel will complete weapons qualification training once every 12 months on all weapons with which they are armed. (T-2) Training consists of classroom and live-fire qualification. SF, Battlefield Airmen AFSCs, and others directed by their AFCFM are additionally required to complete mandatory unit live-fire sustainment training 5 to 7 months after completion of qualification training on their primary weapon(s). Unit sustainment training is at the option of the AFCFM. For Group “A” individuals who require unit live-fire sustainment training, their qualification will expire on the first day of the eighth month after qualification training if unit sustainment training is not accomplished and documented by unit training officials. 5.2.2.1.  Per  unit  SOPs,  DAF  CP/SGs  should  wear  appropriate  law  enforcement equipment and duty belt placement with either M-9 and/or M-4 arming configurations. 5.2.3.  Weapons  firing  for  applicants  that  are  qualifying  for  pre-employment  should  be  the AFQC course of fire; thereafter, Group “A” DAF Civilian Police/Security Guard will fire the prescribed course(s) of fire on all weapons with which they are armed as per AFI 36-2654, to maintain  their  annual  weapons  qualification.  (T-2)  During  weapons  qualification,  if  an employee (applicant/incumbent) is unable to qualify on the required weapon(s), supervisors must place the employee on light duty as weapons qualification is a requirement to perform the employee’s assigned duties. (T-3) The DAF CP/SG can be re-instated when they qualify on the required weapon(s). If an applicant fails the weapons qualification, they are referred to CPO for processing as weapons qualification is a requirement to perform the assigned duties and  a  condition  of  employment.    For  weapons  training  by  other  than  AF  Combat  Arms Personnel and for Unit Live-Fire Proficiency/Sustainment Training, see AFI 36-2654. AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   47  5.2.4.  Unit  stan/eval  sections  will  maintain  written  documentation  of  DPEs  and qualifications  using  prescribed  forms  or  computer  generated  products  as  per  AFI  36-2646. (T-2) 5.2.5.  New Hire awaiting the attendance to Formal Training. The DFC should assign a new hire that does not meet waiver requirements and is in “awaiting formal training status” only to posts that have a certified Civilian or Military SF member as overseer of the new hire, i.e., IEC,  SRT/Patrol  member.  Ensure  the  new  hire  has  received  all  appropriate  local  training required for the assigned posts. The new hire must attend formal training as soon as possible, normally not to exceed 6 months from the date hired. (T-3) 5.2.6.  Training Waiver authority and waiver process is referenced in AFI 36-2646, for future personnel that may meet the training waiver requirement. Previously approved waivers under AF Manual 31-122, Change one, remain honored.  DFCs should be judicious when granting a training waiver and limit it only to extenuating circumstances.   48  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 Chapter 6 PHYSICAL FITNESS STANDARDS 6.1.  Mandate. 6.1.1.  After  the  attacks  of  9/11,  AF  installations  have  been  operating  under  sustained  anti-terrorism/force protection operations; preparing for attacks which can be both  unpredictable and catastrophic. The Air Force PAT for Civilian Applicants for Police and Security Guard Positions standards quantify the AF’s expectations. 6.2.  PT Applicability. 6.2.1.  Successful completion of the PAT is applicable to all civilian applicants/incumbents in the  OPM  occupational  series  0083  (Civilian  Police  to  include  Detectives,  Combat  Arms, Training,  Standardization  Evaluation,  Armorer,  Alarm  Monitor,  Dispatcher,  Military Working  Dog  (MWD)  Police,  Equipment/Resources,  VCC  and  other  0083  series  positions developed  in  the  future)  and  series  0085  (DAF  Security  Guard  and  Contractor  Security Guard  personnel).  Passing  the  PAT  is  a  condition  of  initial  and  continuous  employment, similar to weapons qualification, and the successful passing of standardization evaluation. It is  a  minimum  requirement  of  the  position.  Conduct  PATs  on  a  regular  recurring  basis  (at least  annually).  Conduct  pre-participation  screening/medical  clearance  of  each  individual prior  to  the PAT.  The  screening/medical  clearance  remains  valid  for  one  year,  unless  other health/medical issues are identified in the interim, in which case a new clearance prior to the subsequent  PAT  (see  Attachment  3).  The  PAT  serves  to  provide  a  measure  of  the individual’s preparedness to successfully  accomplish the essential functions of the position. A  Physical  Training  Leader  (PTL)  or  specific  supervisor  should  conduct  the  PAT  for standardization.  PTL/Supervisor  should  complete  the  Physical  Agility  Test  Readiness Review (Attachment 9) prior to conducting the PAT. If block 2 of Attachment 9 is marked, advise  the  participant  that  they  are  now  in  a  light  duty  status,  and  should  follow  the procedures  outlined  in  paragraph  2.11.4  of  this  instruction.  Use  the  PAT  Test  Record (Attachment 10) for PAT documenting. 6.3.  Condition of Employment. 6.3.1.  The AF expects that civilian police and guards should be able to fulfill a full range of activities  under  sometimes  arduous  and  unforgiving  conditions,  performing  integrated defense  tasks  which  may  be  life  threatening.  The  physical  agility  standards  that  the  AF  is implementing quantify the AF’s expectations. In order to meet the condition of employment standard, the individual tested must successfully pass the established standard for each of the elements of the PAT. (T-2) 6.4.  Frequency. 6.4.1.  The SF unit for DAF CP/SG personnel will conduct an annual PAT, with a minimum of four months separating the tests, and document the results. (T-3) If a unit conducts all its PATs  in  a  single  month,  do  not  require  a  new  hire  to  complete  the  test  again  for  at  least  4 months (e.g. officer hired in December would not be required to test in January). The DFC designated  representative/PTL  conducts  the  PAT  for  all  DAF  CP/SG  personnel  for continuity.  Job  descriptions  and  performance  plans/performance  standards/position AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   49  descriptions  contain  the  PAT  requirements  including  running  events.  Conduct  the  PAT  no later than 12 months from the date of the last Record PAT. 6.5.  Applicant. 6.5.1.  Advise an applicant DAF CP/SG in writing, and the Civilian Personnel Office (CPO) should  maintain  a  copy,  at  the  time  of  the  conditional  offer  of  employment  that  they  are required  to  take  the  PAT  within  30  days.  Applicants  must  sign  a  statement  of acknowledgement they have been so advised (see Attachment 2). (T-2) Thereafter, the PAT is an annual requirement. Applicants must meet the PAT requirement before the final offer of employment. (T-3) Applicants are not sworn in as a GS employee until they pass the PAT. The  condition  of  employment  standard  is  met  when  the  applicant  successfully  passes  the established standards for the vertical jump, Illinois agility run, 300 meter run, push-ups and 1.5 mile. Authorize each applicant to take the test twice. Withdraw the conditional job offer after the second failure. 6.6.  Current Incumbent. 6.6.1.  Passing  the  PAT  is  a  recurring,  annual  requirement  to  maintain  status  as  a  GS-0083/0085 employee. DAF CP/SG employees must pass the PAT within one year from the date of their pre-participation clearance and AF Manual 31-122 revision, or local Impact and Implementation  (I  &  I)  of  the  PAT  policy  in  this  publication.  (T-2)  Thereafter,  all  DAF CP/SG  will  require  annual  physical  agility  testing.  (T-2)  In  order  to  meet  the  condition  of employment standard, the individual tested should successfully pass the established standard for  the  push-ups  and  1.5  mile  run  portions  of  the  PAT.  Accomplish  these  elements  of  the PAT at each session. The DAF CP/SG is authorized to take the test twice.  If the DAF CP/SG fails the second PAT, notify the DFC and contact CPO or Civilian Personnel Flight (CPF) for advice  regarding  options  defined  by  applicable  Federal  and/or  agency  instructions  for personnel who no longer meet the minimum PAT qualifications for a DAF CP/SG position. Incumbent DAF SG converting to CP must pass the PAT prior to initial employment for the new position. (T-2) 6.7.  Duty Time Exercising (DTE). 6.7.1.  IAW AFI 36-815, Absence and Leave, Installation Commanders or heads of serviced organizations may excuse civilian employees for physical fitness activities up to 3 hours per week  based  on  mission  and  workload  requirements.  When  DAF  CP/SGs  are  excused  to perform  DTE,  DFC/designated  SF  representative  should  establish  a  monitoring  system  to document a record of member participation. 6.8.  Standards. 6.8.1.  AF  PAT  standards  for  applicants/incumbents  of  0083/0085  positions  consist  of  the following: PAT STANDARDS AND ORDER OF TESTING 6.8.1.1.  Vertical  jump  test.  After  a  10  minute  warm  up,  successfully  jump  16.5”  with  the Vertec Jump Measurement System or yard stick, followed by a 10 minute break. 6.8.1.2.  The  vertical  jump  demonstrates  explosive  leg  power  which  is  used  in  self-defense  and  high  intensity  arrest  or  detention  simulation  training.  Further,  this  is important for performing tasks involving the use of force.   50  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 6.8.1.3.  When  using  the  Vertec  jump  measurement  system,  start  by  standing  under  the apparatus and reaching one hand (hand nearest the apparatus) as high as possible, placing the bicep against the ear; move the stack of movable tabs to a point immediately above the tips of the fingers. Member steps back with either foot, then steps forward and jumps as high as possible and strikes the tabs or the member may jump with both feet and not take a step. Three attempts are allowed. Each attempt is scored to the nearest half inch. 6.8.1.4.  The vertical jump may also be conducted with a yard stick attached to a wall.  It may  be  easier  for  the  test  proctor  to  conduct  the  test  while  standing  on  a  safe  object opposite the yardstick on the wall; this should allow a clear view of the numbers on the yardstick. A half step away from the wall is taken so that the member cannot use the wall to gain leverage to assist them in the jump. 6.8.1.5.  The test starts with the member standing straight and tall with one side of their body flush against  the wall from the outside of the ankle to the tip of the fingers at the end  of  the  same  side  arm  stretched  over  head.  Place  the  palm  of  the  hand  and  fingers (hand  nearest  the  wall)  flat  against  the  yardstick.  Record  the  number  reached  on  the yardstick to the nearest half inch. 6.8.1.6.  The  member  then  takes  half  a  step  away  from  the  wall  to  begin  the  test.  The member steps back with either foot, steps forward and then jumps as high as possible and touches  the  yardstick  (with  hand  nearest  the  wall)  or  the  member  may  jump  with  both feet and not take a step back. Three attempts are allowed. Each attempt is scored to the nearest half inch. Test is terminated when both feet are back on floor. 6.8.1.7.  The  vertical  jump  is  calculated  by  subtracting  the  reaching  height  from  the jumping height and is expressed to the nearest half inch. 6.8.2.  Illinois Agility Run. Successfully complete the course in 18.1 seconds, followed by a 10 minute break. 6.8.2.1.  The  Illinois  Agility  Run  demonstrates  the  coordinated  movement  and  speed necessary to successfully move around objects and people, for instance, in a foot pursuit. 6.8.2.2.  Illinois  agility  run  course:  Use  a  straight  line,  as  on  a  court  or  a  track  as  the start/finish line; place one cone on the line, then place three more cones on a straight line 10 feet apart for a total of 30 feet. The width should be 20 feet, 10 feet to either side of the line of cones (see Figure 6.1. below). AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   51  Figure 6.1.  Illinois Agility Run Description.  6.8.2.3.  Member  lies  on  the  ground  with  fingertips  behind  the  start  line.  At  the  'Go' command,  member  gets  up,  sprints  to  the  far  line  (30'  away),  places  one  foot  over  the line,  then  sprints  back  to  the  start  line.  Member  then  makes  a  left  turn  around  the  first cone  then  zig-zags  in  a  figure  8  fashion  around  four  cones,  10'  apart  on  a  straight  line, then zig zags back to the start line. Member then turns left at the first cone, sprints up to the far line, places one foot over the line and sprints back across the finish line. Member should be provided instructions throughout the test: “Go. Sprint up to the line. Place one foot  over  the  line,  turn  around  and  sprint  back.  Go  around  the  bottom  cone.  Slalom  up through  the  cones,  go  around  the  top  cone;  slalom  back  down  through  the  cones.  Go around the bottom cone.  Sprint  up to the line;  place  one foot over the line;  sprint  back. Run  through  the  finish  line.”  Score  is  timed  in  seconds  and  tenths.  Allow  one  walk through, and two practice runs. When ready, two trials are allowed and the best (lowest) time is scored. 6.8.3.  300 meter run. Complete the distance in 66 seconds or less; followed by a 10 minute break. 6.8.3.1.  Demonstrates  anaerobic  capacity  used  in  high  intensity  baton  and  defensive tactics training, and is important for performing short, intense bursts of effort such as foot pursuits, rescues and use of force situations. 6.8.3.2.  At  the  starting  line,  on  a  flat  surface,  run  300  meters  as  quickly  as  possible. Participants should start at the direction of the timer and are recorded with a stopwatch to the nearest second. 6.8.4.  Pushups. Execute 32 pushups with no time limit, followed by a 30 minute break.   52  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 6.8.4.1.  Demonstrates  a  measure  of  the  muscular  endurance  of  the  upper  body  (chest, shoulders  and  triceps).  This  is  an  important  area  for  many  tasks  involving  use  of  force, lifting, carrying and pushing. 6.8.4.2.  The Participant starts in the front leaning position. Hands are slightly more than shoulder width apart; feet are 12” apart or less. The participant lowers self until the upper arms are parallel to the ground then pushes up again. When an individual does not have arms parallel to the ground, the pushup does not count and the proctor should repeat the same count again. Keep the back straight throughout the exercise. If participant stops to rest,  the member  may remove their hands  or  feet from the  floor, or  bridge or  bow their back, but only in the up/rest position. The body should maintain a rigid form from head to heel.  The  feet  may  not  be  supported  or  braced  (e.g.,  no  crossing  of  the  feet).    The  test ends  when  the  participant  states  they  are  finished  or  (i.e.,  when  the  individual  fails  to maintain proper rest position, stands up, knee(s) touch the ground, etc.). 6.8.5.  1.5  Mile  Run.  Run  1.5  miles  in  16  minutes,  17  seconds  (16:17),  followed  by  a  cool down period. 6.8.5.1.  To  demonstrate  cardio-respiratory  endurance  (or  aerobic  capacity)  used  in extended  control  and  defensive  tactics  training.  This  is  important  for  performing  tasks involving  stamina  and  endurance  (e.g.,  running  on  pursuits,  searches,  prolonged  use  of force situations, etc.) and for minimizing the risk of cardiovascular health problems. 6.8.5.2.  At  the  starting  line,  on  a  flat  surface,  run  or  walk  1.5  miles  as  quickly  as possible. Participants start at the direction of the timer who should measure the time with a stopwatch and record the result to the nearest second. 6.8.6.  Altitude  Adjustments.  For  geographical  areas  that  vary  in  altitude,  make  altitude adjustments for the 1.5 mile run. At an altitude of 5000 feet, a 30 second time adjustment is made. Add an additional 10 seconds for every subsequent 1,000 feet of altitude up to 8,000 feet (for a total of 60 seconds). At 9,000 feet in altitude the time increases by an additional 15 seconds (to 75 seconds total). The time adjusts by 15 seconds for every subsequent 1,000 ft. up  to  12,000  ft.  (120  seconds  total).  For  example,  at  5,000  feet  the  time  criteria  should  be 16:47 min vs. 16:17 below 5,000 ft. An altitude adjustment is not required for the other test items  as  they  are  not  aerobic  in  nature  and  therefore  not  affected  by  the  different  altitude levels. 6.8.7.  Cool-down. Typical cool-down for 5 minutes should include walking and stretches of the muscles that were used until heart rate returns to less than 100 beats per minute (BPM) and  heavy  sweating  stops.  To  determine  BPM,  place  finger  (s)  on  inside  of  wrist  feeling pulse and take the count for 1 minute. 6.8.8.  Retesting Procedures for PAT 6.8.8.1.  DAF CP/SG personnel perform the complete sequence of PAT elements for each PAT retest. 6.8.9.  Physical  Readiness  (Job  Task  Scenario)  Appeals  Test.  The  Physical  Readiness Appeals  Test  is  for  incumbents  who  fail  the  second  exercise  battery  PAT  and  request  to appeal  the  result.  Conduct  this  test  at  VA-LETC,  a  single  and  unbiased  location;  and schedule  when  funding  is  approved  by  the  requesting  MAJCOM  or  unit.  Schedule  the AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   53  incumbent to arrive the day before the test and depart the evening of the test day. Ensure the CFM approves any request to perform the test at a different location. Ensure the incumbent brings a current medical clearance/screening and a completed Attachment 9, signed by their supervisor  to  the  test.  When  the  Physical  Readiness  Appeals  Test  is  performed,  the incumbent  must successfully complete each of the three scenarios within the required time. (T-3) Give this test the third Wednesday of the month. The proctor should use Attachment 11 to record the results of the test and may re-accomplish Attachment 9. The appeals test is not offered to applicants. 6.8.10.  General.  Give  the  appeals  test  as  a  unit  in  one  period  of  time.  There  should  be  a break of no more than an hour, and no less than 40 minutes between each scenario. Do not debrief the individual being tested as to the passing score of an individual test until the end of the session. Give an individual only three scenario tests (i.e., no retest) unless there are very unusual circumstances beyond the control of the test proctors (e.g., lightning in the area). If a test  proctor  determines  that  the  person  taking  the  test  is  not  operating  in  a  proper  manner (e.g.,  mishandling  weapons,  running  during  the  patrol  walk)  the  proctors  may  stop  the scenario being tested and restart the same scenario from the beginning with no time penalty. Complete Attachment 9 at the base. Maintain test results on the form in Attachment 11. 6.8.10.1.  Warm-up. Typical warm-up for 3 minutes should include slow jogging-in-place or  walking  in  place  and  slow  joint  rotation  exercises  (e.g.,  arm  circles,  knee/ankle rotations) to gradually increase the joints’ range of motion, and slow, static stretching of the muscles to be used during the upcoming activity. 6.8.11.  Scenario #1 (Gate Detail), read this script: “In the first scenario, you report to your duty  station  at  the  main  gate  to  the  base  immediately  before  the  start  of  the  morning  rush hour. There is a disabled vehicle in one lane of traffic; bollards and cones have to be quickly put in place after the vehicle is pushed out of the way for safety. The scenario starts with you standing  (in  a  simulated  gate  building).  Watch  this  demonstration.”  (See  Figure  6.2.  Gate Detail Description) 6.8.11.1.  Execute  Scenario  #1:  Member  starts  in  a  standing  position,  on  a  flat  asphalt course.  On  the  command  go,  exit  the  shack,  run  15  feet  to  the  rear  of  the  (disabled) vehicle (vehicle: front wheel drive, curb weight of 3500 lbs. +/- 10%, one person in the vehicle, in the driver’s seat), push the vehicle 35 feet to the side. Immediately move 50 feet  to  a  rack  of  (simulated)  bollards  (nylon  sacks  with  handles,  loaded  with  50  lbs.  of sand).  Pick  up  one  bollard,  run  45  feet  and  place  the  bollard  in  position.  Run  back, retrieve another bollard, run 50 feet and place the bollard in position. Return to the rack a third time, pick up a bollard, run 55 feet and place the bollard in position. Move quickly 50 feet to a pile of cones, pick up five (5) large cones, walk 30 feet, place the cones in a straight line, creating a lane of traffic for entrance  onto  the base. Time stops. Complete the Gate Detail scenario in 125 seconds or less.   54  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 Figure 6.2.  Gate Detail Description.   6.8.12.

Civilian Police/Security Guard Code of Conduct. 7.1.1.  No  code  or  set  of  rules  can  specify  exactly  what  should  be  done  in  every  situation. However, the following code provides general guidelines. 7.1.2.  Exercising Authority. As on-duty civilian police/security guard, DAF CP/SGs are the visible representatives of the US Government, the Air Force, the installation commander, and the  DFC.  It  is  their  duty  to  accept  the  authority  entrusted  to  them  and  to  carry  out  this important trust impartially, firmly, and in a manner that commands respect from the public. 7.1.3.  Fulfilling the Mission. The enforcement of laws and regulations dealing with members of the US Armed Forces brings DAF CP/SGs into direct contact with the public. In fulfilling the Security Force mission, DAF CP/SGs should deal with offenders in a dignified manner. Refrain from being disobedient, insulting, or offensive to the public; and to superiors when in public. 7.1.4.  Personal Appearance. Maintain a high standard of appearance. Set the example for all to follow. 7.1.5.  Personal  Attitudes.  Perform  their  duties  in  an  impartial,  just,  friendly,  and  helpful manner.  The  Air  Force  does  not  tolerate  biases  based  on  age,  physical  disability,  race, religion, national origin, creed, or gender. 7.1.6.  Assistance to Others. Render assistance to the public. Promptly assist any injured or ill individuals. 7.1.7.  Attention to Duty. Remain mindful of duty commitments. Do not consume any form of alcoholic beverage while on duty or within eight hours prior to a duty tour. 7.1.8.  Seeking  Favors.  Do  not  seek  personal  advantage  through  status.  Do  not  try  to  gain favor  or  popularity  by  showing  favoritism,  overlooking  violations,  or  otherwise  failing  to enforce  the  law.  In  addition,  DAF  CP/SG  cannot  accept  any  advantage,  gratuity,  or  reward for performing their official duties. 7.1.9.  Punishment of Offenders. DAF CP/SG has the authority only to apprehend or detain, based upon probable cause,  but DAF CP/SG do not  have the authority to punish offenders. DAF CP/SG use discretion to correct, caution, or warn individuals for minor violations of the law, but cannot admonish or reprimand. 7.1.10.  Apprehension  of  Suspects.  Protect  the  health  and  welfare  of  all  apprehended suspects.  Use  force  according  to  AFI  31-117,  Arming  and  Use  of  Force  by  Air  Force Personnel.  The  USAF  does  not  tolerate  the  intentional  mistreatment  of  apprehended suspects.

Duties and Responsibilities. 7.2.1.  DAF  civilian  police/security  guard  duties  and  responsibilities  vary  greatly  from installation to installation. DFCs should define the number and limits of SF posts, as well as assigned duties, in local duty or post instructions. The three basic duties and responsibilities are always the same. They are: 7.2.2.  Take charge of your post by securing and protecting personnel and property for which you are responsible until properly relieved. Comply with orders and instructions given. These responsibilities continue until relieved by proper authority. 7.2.3.  Report  all  violations  of  orders  you  enforce.  You  have  the  authority  to  apprehend anyone violating those orders. Notify the appropriate control center of the apprehension and detain  the  apprehended  person  until  assistance  arrives.  Written  procedures  cannot  cover  all situations.  In  such  situations,  you  should  exercise  discretion  and  act  according  to  your  best judgment. Immediately contact your superior for instructions. 7.2.4.  Give  the  alarm  in  case  of  disorder  or  emergency.  Report  any  unusual  event  that threatens  the  security  of  the  installation  or  endangers  life  or  property.  Take  reasonable counteraction  to  save  life  and  property  or  lessen  danger.  At  the  same  time,  you  should maintain  the  security  of  your  post  and  remain  alert  for  other  possible  violations  during  the emergency.  JOHN B.

A4.2.19.  Ability  to  patrol  an  area  on  foot  and/or  in  a  vehicle,  apprehend  a  subject,  direct traffic, perform crowd control.  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   69  Attachment 5 DAF CP/SG MEDICAL EVALUATION GUIDELINES A5.1.  Conduct  these  guidelines  by  the  considerations  set  forth  in  5  CFR  Part  339,  Medical Qualifications  Determinations,  and  DoD  Manual  6055.05M,  Occupational  Medical Examinations  and  Surveillance  Manual,  2  May  2007,  Change  1,  16  September  2008,  which requires  special  occupational  medical  examinations  for  security police  and  security  guards. Listed  below  are  some  examples  of  medical  conditions  and/or  physical  impairments  that  may interfere  with  the  safe,  efficient,  and  expected  performance  of  the  essential  duties  and responsibilities of DAF CP/SG personnel. Prior to placement, DAF CP/SG employees will have Optional  Form  178  (OF  178),  Certificate  of  Medical  Examination,  or  equivalent,  signed  by  a military  affiliated  physician  to  identify  individuals  who  are  medically  qualified  for  performing the essential physical and working condition requirements of the position. (T-3) A5.2.  If  a  disease,  condition  or  impairment  develops  in  a  DAF  CP/SG  employee  it  is  the responsibility  of  the  individual  to  notify  the  unit  of  their  change  in  status.  The  unit  in coordination  with  the  Human  Resource  department  should  then  coordinate  with  the  MRO  to ensure appropriate  restrictions  are  in  place,  and  schedule  a  Fitness  For  Duty  determination  as  appropriate  per  5  CFR  Part  339,  Medical  Qualifications  Determinations,  and  DoD  Manual 6055.05M, Occupational Medical Examinations and Surveillance Manual, 2 May 2007, Change 1,  16  September  2008.  The  MRO  may  request  that  the  individual  provide  additional information/documentation from their private physician prior to signing the OF 178,  Certificate of Medical Examination, or equivalent. A5.3.  Periodically assess DAF CP/SG employees to confirm the individual’s ability to meet the performance-related  requirements  of  positions  covered  by  these  guidelines.  If  any  condition  is present that could compromise an essential job function, per Attachment 2, the MRO will place the individual on appropriate duty restrictions until the condition has been resolved, or a Fitness For  Duty  determination  completed  as  required  per  5  CFR  Part  339,  Medical  Qualifications Determinations,  and  DoD  Manual  6055.05M,  Occupational  Medical  Examinations  and Surveillance Manual, 2 May 2007, Change 1, 16 September 2008. (T-0) A5.4.  Medical Evaluation:  Intent A5.4.1.  Certify the individual is medically fit to perform the essential job functions, with or without reasonable accommodation, without posing a direct threat to the health or safety of themselves or others. A5.4.2.  Identify any health condition that may be substantially aggravated by the job. A5.4.3.  Evaluate  an  individual’s  health  and  fitness  to  safely  initiate  or  maintain  a  regular exercise  program  and  take  the  Physical  Fitness  Test;  identify  individual  cardiovascular risk factors and provide advice and assistance in controlling risk factors, including referral to the individual’s personal physician. A5.4.4.  Serve as a baseline for tracking occupational health trends. A5.5.  Medical Evaluation:  Frequency and Follow-up: A5.5.1.  Complete  a  medical  evaluation  on  all  Department  of  the  Air  Force  Civilian  Police and  Security  Guard  (DAF  CP/SG)  personnel  upon  employment,  periodically,  and  on   70  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 termination.  The  offer  of  employment  may  be  contingent  on  medical  certification  of  the ability  to  perform  the  essential  job  functions.  Accomplish  the  initial  medical  evaluation during initial pre-placement evaluation of tentative selectees. A5.5.2.  Periodic  monitoring  examinations  are  conducted  at  scheduled  intervals.  The  DAF CP/SG  should  ensure  periodic  medical  examination  does  not  exceed  a  three  year  period. Periodic  examinations  may  include  an  interval  history,  a  physical  examination,  and/or clinical and laboratory screening tests, as described in DoD Manual 6055.05M (11 November 2008). Medical evaluation may be accomplished more frequently if, in the interim, there are medical  signs  or  symptoms  suggestive  of  cardiovascular  disease  or  another  condition  that might  interfere  with  performance  of  essential  job  functions  or  at  the  discretion  of  the examining physician. A5.6.  Evaluation Instructions A5.6.1.  Accomplish  initial  and  continuing  medical  evaluation  of  DAF  CP/SG  IAW  this guidance.  This  document  should  assist  the  examining  physician  in  identifying    conditions  that  ordinarily  might  be  expected  to  interfere  with  one  or  more essential job functions. A5.6.2.  Individual  medical  information  such  as  hospital  records,  specialized  tests,  or  an examination by another medical specialist may be required to determine if an individual can safely perform the essential functions of the job. A5.6.3.  Periodic  medical  evaluation  should  assess  interval  medical  history  and  changes  in health that might affect the individual’s ability to  perform  essential job functions. It should follow  up  previously  identified  problems  including  cardiovascular  risk  factors  and interventions,  and  evaluate  for  the  presence  of  newly  acquired/developed  risk  factors  or relevant conditions. Except for baseline studies, such as electrocardiography, components of the  periodic  exams  are  essentially  the  same  as  the  initial  exam  as  described  below. Termination  exams  include  evaluations  prompted  by  potential  work  exposures  or  as otherwise clinically indicated. A5.7.  Medical History: A5.7.1.  The  medical  history  should  cover  the  person’s  known  health  problems,  such  as major surgeries, illnesses, medication use, allergies, and alcohol or drug dependence, family history, and a symptom review that might suggest early signs of illness. Attention should be paid  to  findings  suggestive  of  cardiovascular  disease,  such  as  angina  pectoris  or  suspicious chest  discomfort,  dyspnea,  syncope,  precordial  palpitation,  hypertension,  a  history  of myocardial infarction, and heart murmur(s). An occupational history also should be obtained to collect information regarding the person’s past occupational and environmental exposures. A5.8.  Medical Examination: A5.8.1.  The medical exam should focus on the eyes, ears, nose, and throat, the respiratory, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems. Attention should be paid to signs and symptoms suggestive of inability to maintain mental alertness and control of voluntary motor functions. Acuity of the senses, range of motion, and motor strength required to perform essential job functions should be considered. Document the examination on SF 78, or equivalent. A5.9.  Cardiovascular Risk Factors: AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   71  A5.9.1.  Police  and  security  personnel  have  to  respond  to  emergency  situations  that  may impose significant physical and psychological stress. Such stress may trigger sudden death or myocardial  infarction  (MI)  in  the  presence  of  underlying  heart  disease.  For  this  reason, cardiac risk evaluation is most appropriate. A5.9.2.  The  Framingham  10-year  risk  calculator  is  probably  the  most  useful  single  tool  to characterize the risk to a police officer or security guard of a cardiac event. The Framingham Risk  score  uses  independent  risk  factors  (age,  gender,  total  cholesterol,  HDL  cholesterol, systolic  blood  pressure,  treatment  of  hypertension,  and  cigarette  smoking)  to  assess  an individual’s absolute risk for developing a cardiac event, such as MI or new onset angina. A5.9.3.  Generally, those individuals with a high 10-year risk, and those with coronary artery disease  or  coronary  artery  disease  equivalent  (peripheral  arterial  disease,  abdominal  aortic aneurysm, symptomatic carotid artery disease, diabetes) are candidates for additional testing (usually  a  treadmill  stress  test,  stress  thallium,  or  stress  echo).  The  medical  review  officer should  consider  temporarily  disqualifying  these  individuals  from  strenuous  duties  and/or duties that require wearing a respirator (except a mask for escape purposes only), pending the results of evaluation by the workers’ private physician. A5.10.  Diabetes: A5.10.1.  Fasting  blood  sugar  should  be  obtained  because  diabetes  mellitus  frequently  can interfere with safe performance of essential police/ guard functions, such patients should be carefully evaluated. The examinee should have a history of being under excellent control for an  extended  period  of  time,  with  a  glycosylated  hemoglobin  less  than  8.0.  The  examinee should  have  a  history  of  an  absence  of  end  organ  damage  (nephropathy,  neuropathy, proliferative  retinopathy),  an  absence  of  uncontrolled  hypertension,  and  no  history  of ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, nor severe hypoglycemia in the previous year. A5.11.  Lipids: A5.11.1.  Serum  cholesterol,  high  density lipoprotein,  and triglycerides  should  be  evaluated  for  cardiovascular  risk  and  referral  to  the  individual’s private physician when intervention is indicated. low  density lipoprotein, A5.12.  Arrythmias: A5.12.1.  Arrythmias  that  predispose  to  or  have  a  risk  of  cerebral  hypoperfusion  and impaired consciousness are generally not compatible with safe performance of the duties of police and security personnel. Security Force personnel with pacemakers may be qualified if the underlying disease does not pose a significant risk; they should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Implanted defibrillators are generally not compatible with safe performance of the duties of police and security personnel. The pre-placement exam should include a resting electrocardiogram (ECG) for initial evaluation and then as clinically indicated thereafter. A5.13.  Hypertension: A5.13.1.  Blood pressure (the average of at least two independent measurements taken after 15 minutes of rest) should be used in evaluating cardiovascular risk. Refer the individual to their private physician when intervention is indicated. A5.14.  Hearing:   72  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 A5.14.1.  DAF CP/SG personnel require a pre-placement audiogram to determine if they can safely  perform  their  duties.  Audiomety  testing  is  conducted  using  audiometers  (manual  or microprocessor)  calibrated  to  the  current  ANSI  S3.6  standards.      Pure  tone  unaided  air conduction hearing  threshold levels  should  not  exceed  30  dB  hearing  loss  (HL)  on  average for  each  ear  at  500,  1000,  and  2000  Hz,  with  no  level  greater  than  35  dB  HL  at  these frequencies; and thresholds should not exceed 55 dB at 4000 Hz in each ear.  If the hearing is worse than these thresholds, it is questionable whether or not that individual can function as a police/guard. If one ear is deaf or has extremely poor hearing, it is likely the individual would be unable to safely perform DAF CP/SG duties. A5.14.2.  Field “use” tests are neither as reliable nor valid as the speech-in-noise test used by the  audiologist.  Speech-based  “use”  tests  invoke  a  large  number  of  variables  such  as  the content of the message, context, accent, background noise, and so forth. The speech-in-noise test controls for these factors. The "Whispered Voice Test" is no longer valid and should not be accepted by medical professionals. A5.14.3.  DAF  CP/SG  personnel  identified  as  being  occupationally  exposed  to  noise  levels requiring placement in the Hearing Conservation Program, will undergo initial, annual, and termination  audiometric  evaluation  IAW  AFOSH  48-20,  Occupational  Noise  and  Hearing Conservation Program. (T-1) A5.15.  Vision: A5.15.1.  Screening may be performed by the examining physician if they have the capability to perform these tests; optometry referral is not required unless indicated by poor vision or an inability  to  properly  assess  the  vision.  When  an  examinee’s  vision  is  worse  than  indicated below, it is likely the individual may not be able to safely perform the essential job functions; the  examining  physician  should  consider  this  in  his/her  assessment.  Determine  individual limitations on a case-by-case basis. A5.15.2.  Using  the  individual’s  best  optical  correction,  distance  vision  should  be  at  least 20/30 in one eye and 20/100 in the other, or 20/40 in one eye and 20/70 in the other, and near vision  should  be  correctable  to  20/40  binocularly  (both  eyes  open).  Uncorrected  binocular visual acuity should be at least 20/100.   Do not limit successful soft contact lens wearers to any  uncorrected  distance  standard  as  long  as  they  can  be  corrected  to  the  standards  listed above.    Personnel  wearing  soft  contact  lenses  should  provide  evidence  from  their  eye  care professional affirming their successful use of soft contact lenses. A5.15.3.  Individuals should be able to discriminate vivid red/green color. A5.15.4.  Individuals should have normal muscle balance, defined as the lack of strabismus (greater than 15 diopters), nystagmus, and diplopia. A5.15.5.  Additionally, individuals should have at least a total horizontal visual field of 120 degrees  and  at  least  a  total  vertical  visual  field  of  40  degrees  (20  above  the  horizontal meridian and 20 below the horizontal meridian) in each eye. A5.15.6.  Individuals should not have a history of abnormal night vision. A5.16.  Respirators: AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   73  A5.16.1.  Units  must  medically  clear  individuals  who  need  to  wear/use  a  respirator.  (T-3) Ensure medical clearance for respirator use is in accordance with current applicable guidance on the AFOSH 48-137, Respiratory Protection Program. A5.17.  Immunizations: A5.17.1.  Agencies  may  establish  periodic  immunization  programs  by  written  policies  or directives  to  safeguard  the  health  of  employees  whose  work  may  subject  them  or  others  to significant health or safety risks due to occupational or environmental exposure or demands. Make  a  review  of  DAF  CP/SG  immunization  status  to  ensure  members  have  received tetanus, PPD, hepatitis B, and other appropriate immunizations. A5.18.  Psychiatric: A5.18.1.  A  history  or  diagnosis  of  a  psychiatric  disorder,  which  could  affect  safe  and efficient job performance, require additional evaluation to determine whether the individual is able to safely and successfully perform the essential job functions. The presence of any of the following specific psychiatric disorders, or a history of such, warrants further evaluation by  a  psychologist  or  psychiatrist  before  a  DAF  CP/SG  is  deemed  fit  for  duty.  Other psychiatric  disorders  not  listed  here  also  may  warrant  further  evaluation.  A  particular diagnosis need not necessarily have previously been made; rather if there appears to be signs associated with any of the listed diagnoses, this may warrant further evaluation: A5.18.2.  Delirium, dementia, and amnestic and other cognitive disorders A5.18.3.  Major depressive disorder A5.18.4.  Manic-depressive disorder (bipolar) A5.18.5.  Dissociative disorders A5.18.6.  Kleptomania A5.18.7.  Panic disorder and other anxiety disorders (depending upon etiology, duration and severity of clinical expression) A5.18.8.  Pyromania A5.18.9.  Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders A5.18.10.  Personality disorders A5.18.11.  Alcohol or drug dependence A5.18.12.  Neurological:  A  history  of  chronic  headaches,  head  trauma,  cranial  defects,  and epilepsy  are  among  the  neurological  disorders  that  can  interfere  with  DAF  CP/SG functioning. Since epilepsy can be particularly dangerous, ensure the likelihood of an on-the-job  seizure  is  assessed.  To  evaluate  this  risk,  the  recommended  method  is  described  in  the Medical  Screening  Manual  for  California  Law  Enforcement,  pages  IX–3  through  IX–12, available  at    www.post.ca.gov/selection/medical.asp.  In  such  cases,  the  physician  should assess non-seizure related impairments, such as interictal EEG discharges (which can cause transient cognitive impairment) or anti-epileptic drug side effects (about 30% of patients may experience  moderate  to  severe  side  effects  to  include  cognitive  impairment,  visual  effects, and ataxia).   74  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 Attachment 6 AIR FORCE CONTINUED SERVICE AGREEMENT (CSA) FOR CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES A6.1.  I agree that upon completion of the Air Force sponsored training described below, I will work for the US Air Force (see AFI 36-401, Employee Training and Development, Chapter 4, for CSA requirements), in accordance with the US Air Force CSA policy. (The length of full-time training is 8 hours for each day of training, up to a maximum of 40 hours a week.) I understand that if I voluntarily enter a period of non-pay status during the period of service obligation (e.g., LWOP to accompany a spouse moving to a new duty location), the period of obligated service may be extended by length of time in a non-pay status. A6.2.  If I voluntarily leave the Air Force before completing the period of service shown in item 7 below, I AGREE to reimburse the Air Force for the tuition, travel, per diem, books, materials, fees,  administrative  overhead  costs, and  other  related  expenses  (EXCLUDING  SALARY)  paid in  connection  with  my  training  as  shown  in  item  8  below.  However,  the  amount  of  the reimbursement  will  be  reduced  on  a  pro-rated  basis  for  the  percentage  of  completion  of  the obligated service. (For example, if the cost of training is $3,000 and I complete two-thirds of the obligated service, I will reimburse the Air Force $1,000 instead of the original $3,000.) A6.3.  I  FURTHER  AGREE  that  if  I  voluntarily  leave  the  Air  Force  to  enter  the  service  of another Federal agency or other organization in any branch of the government before completing the period of service agreed to in item 7 below, I will give my servicing civilian personnel office written  notice  of  at  least  10  workdays,  during  which  time  a  determination  concerning reimbursement will be made. If I fail to give this advance notice, I AGREE to pay the amount of additional  expenses  (Title  5  U.S.C.  4109(a)  (2),  Expenses  of  Training)  incurred  by  the government in this training. A6.4.  I understand that any amounts which may be due the Air Force as a result of any failure on my part to meet the terms of this agreement may be withheld from any monies owed me by the government, or may be recovered by such other methods as are approved by law. A6.5.  I  FURTHER  AGREE  to  obtain  approval  from  the  employee  development  manager responsible  for  authorizing  training  requests  of  any  proposed  change  in  my  approved  training program  involving  course  and  schedule  changes,  withdrawals  or  in-completions,  and  increased costs.  If  I  fail  to  complete  Air  Force  sponsored  training  I  AGREE  to  reimburse  the  Air  Force training and related costs as in item 8 below. A6.6.  I  acknowledge  that  this  agreement  does  not  in  any  way  commit  the  government  to continue  my  employment.    I  understand  that  if  there  is  a  transfer  of  my  service  obligation  to another Federal agency or other organization in any branch of the government, the agreements in items  A6.1  A6.2.,  and  A6.3  of  this  section  will  remain  in  effect  until  I  have  completed  my obligated service with that other agency or organization.

DFCs do not have the authority to waive appearance and grooming standards except as identified. 3. Installation commanders should determine what is extreme or faddish. The installation commander may delegate this authority to subordinate commanders to the squadron commander level. 4. If due to a temporary medical condition (i.e., radiation/chemotherapy and resulting in baldness), DFCs should authorize wear of the American Cancer Society-approved cap (black/tan).  5. (Women) should not apply designs to nails or apply two-tone or multi-tone colors on duty excluding French manicure. 6. (Women) Medical waivers are necessary for situations that require baldness as a medical necessity while in uniform. 7. The intent of this item is that long hair should be styled in a manner that prevents loose ends from extending upward on the head. (For example: when using the claw clip or hairpins, hair should not present the appearance of a rooster tail; when hair is in a bun, tuck in and secure all loose ends; when hair is in a ponytail, pull all the way through the elastic band and it may hang naturally downward, not extending below the bottom of the collar). As with all hairstyles, a neat and professional image is essential.     80  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 QUALIFICATION REVIEW BOARD FOR EMPLOYEES OF DAF CIVILIAN POLICE AND SECURITY GUARD (CP/SG) POSITIONS Attachment 8 A8.1.  Organization: A8.1.1.  The Security Forces Qualifications Review Board (SF-QRB) is established to review cases for incumbent officers who meet the full range of duties contained within their Position Description  (e.g.,  the  PAT),  but  cannot  meet  the  established  medical  standards  (e.g.,  color blind in one eye). The SF-QRB is an appeals board for incumbents with permanent or long term medical conditions that fall outside of the scope of light duty. The SF- QRB should also consider  issues  that  are  not  strictly  medical  (e.g.,  reasonable  accommodation  and/or assessment of undue hardship on the Air Force security operations) and issues that are legal (i.e., application  of the Rehabilitation Act/ADA with respect to reasonable accommodation). The  AFSFC  Commander  will  appoint  the  members  of  the  SF-QRB.  (T-1)  The  SF-QRB should consist of: DAF CP/SG Career Field Advisor or when designated the AFSFC Deputy Director;  AFSFC  Operations  Division  Chief  (or  Deputy);  and  Programs  and  Resources Division Chief (or Deputy). The SF-QRB may also include a MAJCOM Director of Security Forces  (or  Deputy).  HQ  AFRC/A4S  should  have  a  member  on  the  SF-QRB  when  a  DAF CP/SG assigned to AFRC is being evaluated for continued employment. A legal advisor from the  Secretary  of  Air  Force  General  Counsel’s  Administrative  Law  Division  (SAF/GCA)  or local legal office (installation level) should provide legal advice to the SF-QRB. AF/SG or a local  Medical  Review  Officer  (MRO)  should  support  the  board  to  make  medical  standard qualification/disqualification recommendations. A representative from the civilian personnel community (installation level or AFPC) may also serve as advisor. The DAF CP/SG Career Field  Advisor  or  when  designated  the  AFSFC  Deputy  Director  will  serve  as  the  SF-QRB Chair. (T-1) The SF-QRB may operate virtually or physically. A8.2.  Waiver process: A8.2.1.  The  waiver  process  applies  to  employees  who  receive  a  determination  of  “Not Medically  Qualified”.  The  local  MRO  should  inform  all  employees  of  the  results  of  their occupational  medical  examinations  as  soon  as  possible  following  completion  of  the examination.  Do  not  consider  waivers  for  employees  who  have  a  permanent  or  long  term medical  disqualification  unless  they  can  provide  objective  medical  documentation  that demonstrates  that  they  can  perform  the  essential  functions  of  the  position  with  or  without reasonable  accommodation.  Waivers  for  those  employees  having  “temporary”  medical conditions  are  handled  through  light  duty  policy.  Once  the  employee  chooses  to  appeal, he/she  should  submit  the  appeal  request  through  their  DFC.  The  DFC  should  contact  the local  MRO  who  determines  which  medical  specialist  (e.g.,  Endocrinologist,  Internist)  to consult,  and  what  additional  information  is  needed.  Inform  the  individual  that  the  cost  of gathering  this  additional  medical  information  is  at  their  own  expense.  After  the  specialist completes  the  evaluation  to  provide  the  additional  required  data,  the  specialist  should  send the  information  to  the  MRO.  The  MRO  reviews  the  specialist’s  recommendation  and determines if the officer is/is not medically qualified based upon the additional information. If  the  individual  remains  disqualified,  and  chooses  to  continue  with  the  appeal  (Official Request  for  Waiver)--the  local  MRO  should  send  documentation  on  the  results  of  the occupational  medical  examination, if  appropriate, information  and, the  specialist’s AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015   81  information  regarding  potential  reasonable  accommodations  and/or  restrictions  to  a  doctor (QRB  Medical  Advisor)  at  JBSA  Lackland  AFB.  The  QRB  Medical  Advisor  reviews  the package  and  convenes  with  SJA,  HR,  and  the  Qualification  Review  Board  (QRB)  at  the AFSFC  (contact  DAF  CP/SG  Program  Manager  for  specific  QRB  process).  The  QRB  can choose  to  send  their  recommendation  to  a  specialist  at  the  Air  Staff  who  can  provide additional consultation on the determination. Send the SF-QRB’s appeal recommendation to the  AFSFC/CC  to  make  the  final  QRB  determination.  Limit  access  to  protected  health information to only qualified healthcare representatives of management with a need to know. Submit the request in time to arrive at the office of the DAF CP/SG Career Field Advisor or when  designated  the  AFSFC  Deputy  Director  within  20  calendar  days  of  the  employees’ written request for a waiver. Requests may be submitted in paper form, via fax, or electronic means  and  should  be  immediately  digitized  or  scanned  for  electronic  use,  storage  and maintenance. The individual requesting the waiver should maintain confirmation records of facsimile and/or electronic delivery (read-receipt), in the event a timeliness issue arises. A8.2.2.  At a minimum, ensure the request for a waiver contains: A8.2.3.  Date of request for a waiver. A8.2.4.  Name and contact information. A8.2.5.  Unit of assignment and supervisor’s name. A8.2.6.  Rationale  explaining  why  he/she  is  not  medically  qualified,  etc.  If  employee  has veteran’s  preference  as  a  disabled  veteran,  submit  the  VA  rating  decision  form.  If  medical information is included, a request for a release of medical information may be requested by the SF-QRB. A8.2.7.  Requested action and/or proposals for reasonable accommodation. A8.3.  Convene the SF-QRB: A8.3.1.  The  DAF  CP/SG  Career  Field  Advisor  or  when  designated  the  AFSFC  Deputy Director will convene an SF-QRB within 30 calendar days, or as soon thereafter as practical, of  receiving  the  request  for  a  waiver.  (T-1)  Normally  requesters  do  not  appear  in  person before the SF-QRB. However, as indicated above, they can communicate to the SF-QRB any information that they believe is relevant. If the SF-QRB has any questions or concerns upon review  of  the  submitted  material,  the  Chair  should  make  arrangements  for  the  requestor  to address those areas either in writing, by telephone and/or video conference. A8.3.2.  SF-QRB Recommendation: In matters heard by the SF-QRB, the board will issue a recommendation under the Chair’s signature to AFSFC/CC. (T-1) The AFSFC Commander retains the authority to review and modify any SF-QRB recommendation. The decision of the AFSFC  Commander  is  the  final  official  agency  decision.  The  agency  will  issue  a  final decision within 60 calendar days of the meeting of the SF-QRB meeting. (T-1) The AFSFC Commander should forward the determination to the DFC for the final disposition. A8.3.3.  Notification  to  employees:  The  employee’s  supervisor  is  responsible  for  informing the  employee  who  requested  the  waiver  of  the  outcome  of  the  QRB.  If  the  employee  is represented  by  counsel,  the  legal  counsel  who  participated  in  the  meeting  should  also participate in any explanatory discussions at which the employee is present. The procedures used by the SF-QRB should be developed in a separate standard operating instruction.   82  AFI31-122  31 JULY 2015 Attachment 9 PHYSICAL AGILITY TEST READINESS REVIEW Table A9.1.
