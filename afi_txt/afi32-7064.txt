AFI  32-7001,  Environmental  Management  provides  direction  for  the  Air  Force  Environmental Management  System.    Natural  Resources  are  an  Environmental  Aspect  within  the  Air  Force EMS. 12 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 3 IMPLEMENTING INTEGRATED NATURAL RESOURES MANAGEMENT 3.1.  Integrated  Natural  Resources  Management  Plan.  In accordance with the Sikes Act, 16 U.S.C  §670  et.  seq.,  the  INRMP  is  the  principal  tool  for  managing  military  installation  natural resources.  Each military installation in the United States under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of  Defense  must  prepare  and  implement  an  INRMP  unless  a  determination  is  made  that  the absence of significant natural resources makes preparation of such a plan inappropriate (see 3.2).  (T-0).    Prepare  INRMPs  to  assist  the  installation  commander  with  the  conservation  and rehabilitation  of  natural  resources  consistent  with  the  use  of  the  installation  to  ensure  the readiness  of  the  Armed  Forces.  The  INRMP  defines  natural  resources  management  goals  and objectives that are consistent with the military mission, and ensures no net loss in the capability of  installation  lands  to  support  the  military  mission.    All  installation  organizations,  to  include tenant units, must support the implementation of INRMP goals and objectives, as applicable.  (T-0).  Attachment 2 provides guidelines for INRMP preparation. 3.2.  Determining  the  Need  for  an  INRMP.  Air  Force  determines  the  requirement  for  an installation INRMP based on Category I and II criteria defined below. 3.2.1.  Category  I  Criteria:    Category  I  installations  require  an  INRMP.    Category  I installations  have  significant  natural  resources  requiring  conservation  and  management.  Installation  size  (acreage)  should  not  be  used  as  a  sole  determining  factor  in  deciding  the need  for  an  INRMP.    The  United  States  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  (USFWS)  and  the  state fish  and  wildlife  management  agency  should  be  consulted  when  determining  if  significant natural  resources  exist  to  warrant  an  INRMP.    Installations  including  or  bordering  marine environments  should  also  consult  with the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric Administration,  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  (NOAA  Fisheries).    An  installation  has significant  natural  resources,  and  will  develop  and  implement  an  INRMP,  if  any  of  the following criteria apply: (T-0). 3.2.1.1.  The installation conducts on-the-ground military missions on unimproved lands that  necessitates  conservation  measures  to  sustain  the  natural  resources  and  minimize impacts (e.g. soil erosion control). 3.2.1.2.  Species  listed  as  threatened  or  endangered  in  accordance  with  the  Endangered Species  Act  (ESA)  (16  U.S.C.  §§1531-1544)  are  present  on  the  installation,  or  critical habitat  has  been  designated  or  is  currently  proposed  on  the  installation,  and  active installation conservation measures are necessary to conserve the species. 3.2.1.3.  Hunting,  fishing  or  other  natural  resources-based  outdoor  recreation  activities (e.g. off-road vehicles) are allowed on the installation. 3.2.1.4.  The  installation  operates  outgrants  (leases,  licenses,  permits)  for  livestock grazing, crop production, or stable operations that allow horseback riding on unimproved lands. 3.2.1.5.  The installation operates a commercial forestry program or manages other non-urban  forest  lands  in  support  of:  readiness  and  training  activities,  maintaining  forest health, or in support of other ecosystem management goals and objectives. AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 13 3.2.1.6.  The  installation  has  significant  Bird/wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  issues  that require  habitat  manipulation  outside  the  managed  airfield;  or  require  wildlife  hazing  or depredation  activities  that  are  beyond  the  scope  of  standard  bird/wildlife  prevention, control,  and  dispersal    operations  conducted  under  the  auspices  of  a  BASH  Plan administered by the Wing Flight Safety office. 3.2.1.7.  Important  or  unique  biological  resources  are  present,  such  as  wetlands,  species listed for state protection, candidate species for federal protection, or unique habitats that provide  essential  loafing,  nesting,  or  foraging  areas  for  migratory  birds,  bats,  or  other wildlife protected by state or federal law.  The unique character of a biological resource is determined  through  consultation  with  the  USFWS  and  state  fish  and  wildlife  agency, whereby  it is established that ecological issues related to the resource require a level of planning and management that can only be addressed by an INRMP. 3.2.2.  Category II Criteria:  Category II installations do not require an INRMP.  Category II installations  are  deemed  exempt  from  the  INRMP  requirement  because  of  the  absence  of significant natural resources as defined by the Category I criteria.  Consult with the USFWS and  appropriate  state  natural  resource  management  agencies  when  determining  whether significant  natural  resources  exist.    Additionally,  consult  with  NOAA  Fisheries  if  the installation  includes  or  borders  marine  environments.    The  Director,  AF/A4C,  or  delegated authority will confirm Category II status. 3.3.  Cooperative  INRMP  Preparation.  Prepare  INRMPs  in  cooperation  with  appropriate stakeholders.    Notify  stakeholders  when  a  new  or  revised  INRMP  is  prepared,  and  solicit participation and input to the INRMP development and review process.  Attachment 3 specifies the required coordination and approval process and timeline for cooperative INRMP preparation. 3.3.1.  Internal  Stakeholder  Participation.  Implementation  of  an  INRMP  requires  the  action and/or  collaboration  of  the  entire  installation  command  structure  as  well  as  tenant organizations  to  ensure  mission  readiness.    Solicit  participation  from  known  installation stakeholders early in the INRMP preparation process, to include the Flight Safety office. 3.3.2.  Interagency Stakeholder Participation.  The Sikes Act Section 101(a)(2) (16 U.S.C. § 670a(a)(2)).,  requires  that  an  INRMP  be  prepared  in  cooperation  with  the  USFWS,  the appropriate  state  fish  and  wildlife  agency  for  the  state  in  which  the  military  installation  is located,  and  NOAA  Fisheries  for  installations  that  include  or  border  marine  environments.  Invite the USFWS, NOAA Fisheries (if applicable), and the state fish and wildlife agency to participate in the scoping, design, and preparation of an INRMP.  For installations occupying lands withdrawn from the public domain, invite the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to participate in the scoping and design of an INRMP.  On withdrawn lands where the BLM is a stakeholder, a Memorandum of Understanding between the installation and the BLM may be used  to  establish  agreement  on  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  party  for  the management of installation natural resources. 3.3.3.  Internal  Review.    Draft  INRMP  documents  require  internal  agency  review  prior  to release for review and comment by external agencies and the general public. 3.3.3.1.  Submit the draft INRMP for formal review and comment within the installation chain of command.  Incorporate comments into the INRMP as appropriate. 14 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 3.3.3.2.  Provide  the  Installation  Support  Team  the  opportunity  to  review  and  comment on  draft  INRMP  documents;  and  to  Headquarters,  Air  National  Guard  for  ANG installations (T-2). 3.3.4.  Interagency Review.  Provide the USFWS, state fish and wildlife agency, and NOAA Fisheries (when applicable), the opportunity to review a draft INRMP before submitting the document  for  public  review.    For  installations  occupying  lands  withdrawn  from  the  public domain,  ensure  the  BLM  is  also  given  the  opportunity  to  review  a  draft  INRMP  before submitting for public review. 3.3.5.  Public  Review.    Provide  an  opportunity  for  the  public  to  review  any  initial  draft INRMP  document,  or  major  INRMP  revision,  and  provide  comments.    Make  public notification when a draft INRMP is available for comment, and ensure the period allowed for the  submittal  of  comments  is  no  less  than  30  days.    Ensure  the  USFWS,  state  fish  and wildlife agency, and NOAA Fisheries (if applicable), are also given the opportunity to review all public comments received on an INRMP. 3.4.  INRMP  Approval.  An INRMP is  considered  compliant  with the Sikes Act if it has  been approved in  writing  by the  appropriate representative  from  each  cooperating  agency  within the past five years.  Approval of a new or revised INRMP is documented by signature on a signature page signed by the Installation Commander (or designee), and a designated representative of the USFWS,  state  fish  and  wildlife  agency,  and  NOAA  Fisheries  when  applicable.    A  letter  of coordination  and  approval  signed  by  the  designated  representative  of  a  cooperating  agency suffices  in  lieu  of  a  signature  on  the  INRMP  signature  page.    INRMP  approval  is  sustained through  the  annual  INRMP  review  and  coordination  process  (see  3.5).    The  INRMP  is considered current until an annual review coordination process results in a determination by the cooperating agencies that a revision is necessary; or if concurrence is rescinded by notice from a cooperating agency. The BLM is not a required signatory to an INRMP, but ensure the agency is given the opportunity to review and comment on draft INRMP documents. 3.4.1.  Establishment of Mutual Agreement.  Each signature on an INRMP signature page, or approval letter, reflects the mutual agreement of the parties on those portions of the INRMP within  the  scope  of  each  agency’s  authority.    By  signature  of  the  authorized  representative from  a  cooperating  agency,  the  agency  asserts  agreement  that  the  INRMP  is  sufficient  and compliant in accordance with the Sikes Act.  Mutual agreement is the goal with respect to the entire INRMP.  However, mutual agreement is necessary only with respect to those elements of  the  INRMP  that  are  subject  to  the  jurisdictional  authority  of  the  USFWS  or  NOAA Fisheries  as  specified  by  law  (e.g.  ESA,  Marine  Mammal  Protection  Act),  or  the  inherent rights of the state to conserve, protect, and manage fish and wildlife resources. 3.4.2.  Failure to Reach Mutual Agreement.  In cases where the USFWS or state withholds its agreement to an INRMP based on objections to elements of the INRMP that are clearly not within the scope of the particular agency's authority, an installation may, notwithstanding the objections,  finalize  the  INRMP  as  specified  in  Attachment  3  and  proceed  to  manage  its natural  resources  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  plan.    The  installation  shall  seek  a written explanation from a cooperating agency to document why a signature is withheld. INRMP  Review  and  Coordination.  Establish  and  maintain 3.5.  Annual regular communications  with  the  appropriate  federal  and  state  agencies  for  the  region  where  the installation is located (see 2.3).  At a minimum, the installation natural resources manager shall AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 15 conduct  an  annual  review  of  the  INRMP  in  coordination  with  internal  stakeholders  and  local representatives  of  the  USFWS,  state  fish  and  wildlife  agency,  and  NOAA  Fisheries  where applicable.  Installations will document the findings of the annual review in an Annual INRMP Review  Summary.    By  signature  to  the  Annual  INRMP  Review  Summary,  the  collaborating agency representative asserts concurrence with the findings.  If any agency declines to participate in  an  on-site  annual  review,  the  installation  shall  submit  an  Annual  INRMP  Review  Summary document  to  the  agency  via  official  correspondence  and  request  return  correspondence  with concurrence. (T-0).  3.5.1.  The installation natural resource manager must ensure the following is included in the Annual INRMP Review Summary:  (T-1). 3.5.1.1.  A summary of specific INRMP accomplishments since the last review. 3.5.1.2.  A summary of the required INRMP updates into the INRMP to keep the INRMP current  in  operation  and  effect  for  the  management  of  installation  natural  resources;  or alternatively,  a  statement  that  significant  changes  to  the  installation  mission  or  natural resources goals require an INRMP revision (see 3.6) meeting. 3.5.1.3.  A  statement  that  sufficient  numbers  of  qualified  natural  resources  management personnel and resources are available to oversee implementation of projects and activities identified in the INRMP Work Plan. 3.5.1.4.  An  Annual  Work  Plan  for  implementing  the  INRMP  that  includes  the  current year  and  at  least  two  future  fiscal  years.  The  Work  Plan  must  include  all  projects  and activities  identified  as  essential  for  the  successful  implementation  of  INRMP  goals  and objectives, and an implementation schedule that is realistic and practicable. 3.5.1.5.  A  statement  indicating  the  projects  in  the  Annual  Work  Plan  for  which  the collaborating agencies have expressed an interest in participating in project execution.  If the collaborating agencies do not express an interest in executing projects in the Annual Work  Plan,  then  include  the  following  statement  in  the  Annual  INRMP  Review Summary: “The execution strategy for the Annual Work Plan has been discussed with the participating  agencies,  and  the  agency  representatives  have  not  expressed  an  interest  in participating  in  project  execution,  and  agree  that  implementation  will  be  performed through other authorized acquisition methods.” 3.6.  INRMP Update and Revision.  Conduct INRMP updates and revisions in cooperation with the USFWS, state fish and wildlife agency, and NOAA Fisheries where applicable.  Include all appropriate internal and external stakeholders in the update and revision process.  In accordance with the Sikes Act, ensure the cooperating agencies review an INRMP on a regular basis, but not less  often  than  every  five  years.    Cooperating  agencies  should  mutually  agree  that  the  INRMP presents  a  natural  resources  management  program  that  is  current  as  to  operation  and  effect  for those elements of the INRMP under the jurisdictional authority of each agency. 3.6.1.  INRMP  Update.    An  INRMP  update  consists  of  minor  edits  that  provide  current information,  or  adjusts  implementation  timelines  that  would  not  result  in  changes  to management  goals  and  objectives  that  are  substantively  different  than  those  previously agreed to by the cooperating agencies, and would not result in environmental consequences different from those in the existing INRMP.  Minor update requirements are identified during the annual INRMP review and coordination (see 3.5).  An INRMP update documents minor 16 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 changes agreed to by the partners on how the INRMP is implemented, and does not represent a  change  in  the  scope  of  the  INRMP.    Mutual  agreement  by  cooperating  agencies  that  an updated  INRMP  remains  current  as  to  operation  and  effect  with  respect  to  the  Sikes  Act  is documented by signatures to the Annual INRMP Review Summary document.  An INRMP update  does  not  require  public  review  and  comment  on  the  decision  to  continue implementing the INRMP as updated. 3.6.2.  INRMP Revision.  Revise an INRMP if changes in the installation mission or land use would  alter  the  biogeophysical  environment  such  that  significant  edits  need  to  be  made  to ensure that the INRMP reflects the current natural resources management requirements and appropriate  program  goals  and  objectives.    Revise  an  INRMP  if  a  change  in  land  use  or condition would result in environmental impacts not anticipated by the parties to the INRMP when  the  INRMP  was  last  reviewed  as  to  operation  and  effect.    The  need  for  an  INRMP revision  is  determined  during  the  annual  INRMP  review  (see  3.5).    Provide  an  opportunity for the public to review and comment on a draft INRMP revision (see 3.3.3).  For new and revised INRMPs, mutual agreement by a cooperating agency is documented by the signature of an authorized representative from each agency on the signature page for the INRMP, or by written correspondence (see 3.4). 3.7.  Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) and INRMP Implementation.  Actions proposed  as  part  of  development  of  an  INRMP  generally  constitute  an  action  subject  to  the National  Environmental  Policy  Act,  the  Council  on  Environmental  Quality  (CEQ)  Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the NEPA, and the Air Force’s EIAP.  Consider the effects of implementing the INRMP in support of the decision(s) to implement the INRMP and  in  furtherance  of  40  C.F.R.  §1505.25.    Alternative  means  of  implementing  the  proposed INRMP constitute the alternatives considered, and integrated, in the NEPA analysis and should be generally formatted and generally scoped to allow tiering consistent with 40 C.F.R. §1500.4, 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(b), and 40 C.F.R. §1502.20. 3.8.  Ecosystem  Management.  The  INRMP  implements  ecosystem  management  on  AF installations by setting goals for attaining a desired land condition.  When preparing or revising an  INRMP,  follow  the  ecosystem  management  principles  and  guidelines  in  DoDI  4715.03, Natural Resources Conservation Program, and the guidance provided herein. (T-0). 3.8.1.  Air Force Principles for Ecosystem Management. 3.8.1.1.  Maintain  or  restore  native  ecosystem  types  across  their  natural  range  where practical and consistent with the military mission. 3.8.1.2.  Maintain  or  restore  ecological  processes  such  as  fire  and  other  disturbance regimes where practical and consistent with the military mission. 3.8.1.3.  Maintain  or  restore  the  hydrological  processes  in  streams,  floodplains,  and wetlands when feasible and practical and consistent with military mission. 3.8.1.4.  Use regional approaches to implement ecosystem management on an installation by  collaboration  with  other  DoD  components  as  well  as  other  federal,  state  and  local agencies, and adjoining property owners. AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 17 3.8.1.5.  Provide  for  outdoor  recreation,  agricultural  production,  harvesting  of  forest products, and other practical utilization of the land and its resources, provided that such use does not inflict long-term ecosystem damage or negatively impact the AF mission. 3.8.2.  Biodiversity Conservation.  Biodiversity conservation is an integral part of ecosystem management.    Maintain  or  reestablish  viable  populations  of  all  native  species  on  AF-controlled  lands  when practical  and  consistent  with  the  military  mission  and  not  in  conflict with  airfield  operations.    Consider  the  effects  of  climate  change  in  plans  to  restore  native ecosystems. 3.8.3.  Climate  Change.    Changing  climate  conditions  may  significantly  affect  native ecosystems  and  require  the  Air  Force  to  adjust  natural  resources  management  strategies  to support  military  mission  requirements  and  address  the  needs  of  sensitive  species.    INRMP goals and objectives for ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation must consider projected  climate  change  impacts,  and  favor  an  adaptive  ecosystem-based  management approach  that  will  enhance  the  resiliency  of  the  ecosystem  to  adapt  to  changes  in  climate.  The INRMP will assess climate change risks, vulnerabilities, and adaptation strategies using authoritative  region-specific  climate  science,  climate  projections,  and  existing  tools.    The INRMP  should  list,  or  include  by  reference,  installation-specific  climate  data  and  region-specific climate projections from the most current quadrennial National Climate Assessment Report, and include other pertinent Federal climate science documents as appropriate.    (T-2). 3.8.4.  Exotic and Invasive Species Control.  The INRMP indicates if any exotic and invasive species are present on an installation, and identifies any existing programs to control and/or eradicate those species.  Develop and implement management strategies oriented toward the control  of  exotic  and  invasive  species  when  practical  and  consistent  with  the  military mission. 3.9.  Staffing.  As defined in DoDI 4715.03, installations will use professionally trained natural resources management personnel with a degree in the natural sciences to develop and implement the installation INRMP. (T-0). 3.9.1.  Outsourcing  Natural  Resources  Management.    As  stipulated  in  the  Sikes  Act,  16 U.S.C. §670 et. seq., the Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-76, Performance of  Commercial  Activities,  August  4,  1983  (Revised  May  29,  2003)  does  not  apply  to  the development,  implementation  and  enforcement  of  INRMPs.    Activities  that  require  the exercise  of  discretion  in  making  decisions  regarding  the  management  and  disposition  of government owned natural resources are inherently governmental.  When it is not practicable to utilize DoD personnel to perform inherently governmental natural resources management duties,  obtain  these  services  from  federal  agencies  having  responsibilities  for  the conservation and management of natural resources. 3.9.2.  Use  of  Non-Appropriated  Fund  Personnel.    Non-Appropriated  Fund  personnel  and resources  may  be  utilized  to  assist  in  the  implementation  of  natural  resources  management programs.  In such cases, supervision and control of natural resources management programs remain under the designated natural resources program manager for the installation. 3.9.3.  Wildland Fire and Conservation Law Enforcement.  Title 10, U.S.C., §2465 prohibits contracts for performance of firefighting or security guard functions, with some exceptions.  18 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 Contractors may not perform firefighting or conservation law enforcement as a primary task unless an exception to 10 U.S.C. §2465 applies. 3.10.  Integration of Natural Resources Management with Other Air Force Programs. 3.10.1.  Integration with the Installation Planning Process.  The INRMP is a key component plan  of  the  Installation  Development  Plan  as  detailed  in  AFI  32-7062,  Air  Force Comprehensive  Planning.    The  INRMP  identifies  natural  resource  features  that  need  to  be considered  and  incorporated  into  the  Installation  Development  Plan  and  other  component plans and studies regarding future installation development. 3.10.2.  Integration  with  EIAP.    Integration  with  EIAP.    The  installation  or  IST  natural resources  manager  will  collaborate  with  the  action  proponent  and  the  EIAP  manager  to ensure  that  activities  that  may  affect  natural  resources  are  fully  considered  in  compliance with NEPA.(T-0). 3.10.3.  Integration  with  Other  Installation  Programs.    Coordinate  draft  INRMP  revisions through  the  installation  chain  of  command  and  the  BASH  working  group.    Ensure  that  the INRMP,  Integrated  Cultural  Resources  Management  Plan,  Bird/Wildlife  Strike  Hazard (BASH)  Plan,  Integrated  Pest  Management  Plan  (IPMP),  and  Air  Installation  Compatible Use Zone studies are mutually supportive and not in conflict. 3.11.  Preventing Natural Resources Damage from Air Force Activities. 3.11.1.  Prior to initiation of any new construction activity, the installation natural resources manager  will  coordinate  on  all  Certificates  of  Compliance  for  Critical  Planning  Actions prepared IAW  AFI  32-1021,  Planning  and  Programming  Military  Construction  (MILCON) Projects. 3.11.2.  Ensure Environmental Restoration Program operations conducted IAW AFI 32-7020, The  Environmental  Restoration  Program  include  plans  to  mitigate  potential  damage  to natural resources from restoration activities. 3.11.3.  Real  property  outleases,  easements,  or  licenses  on  Air  Force  property  may  not negatively impact the ability of an installation to meet statutory requirements for compliance with federal and applicable state laws related to natural resources conservation. 3.12.  Assessing  Natural  Resources  Damage  by  Other  Parties.  In  the  event  that  natural resources  under  AF  control  are  damaged  by  another  party,  such  as  an  accidental  spill  of  a hazardous substance, the installation incurring the damage assesses and claims damages.  Refer to  Title  43,  C.F.R.  §11,  Natural  Resource  Damage  Assessments  for  guidance  on  claiming damages.  Recovered funds are used to restore, replace, or acquire equivalent natural resources on the installation where the damage occurred.  Installations must coordinate with AFCEC/CZ, SAF/IEE and AFLOA/JACE during the claims process. (T-0). 3.13.  Natural  Resources  Program  Metrics.  DoDI  4715.03  identifies  the  natural  resources conservation  metrics  that  must  be  tracked  and  reported  to  DoD  as  part  of  the  annual Environmental  Management  Review,  and  for  the  Defense  Environmental  Programs  Annual Report to Congress.  AF/A4C may develop and track other measures of merit to monitor natural resources  program  performance  and  ensure  compliance  with  law.    Installations  will  report required  metrics  data  to  AFCEC  for  integration  and  upward  reporting to  AF/A4C  and  SAF/IE. (T-0). AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 19 3.14.  Recognition  of  Outstanding  Natural  Resources  Management.  The  AF  General Thomas  D.  White  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  environmental  awards  program  recognizes outstanding individual and installation contributions to natural resources management.  See AFI 36-2817, Engineering Awards Program, for standards and submittal procedures. 20 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 4 WETLANDS AND WATERS OF THE UNITED 4.1.  Protection  of  Wetlands.  In  compliance  with  Executive  Order  11990,  Protection  of Wetlands,  May  24,  1977,  the  AF  will  seek  to  preserve  the  natural  values  of  wetlands  while carrying  out  its  mission  on  both  AF  lands  and  non-AF  lands.    To  the  maximum  extent practicable, the AF will avoid actions which would either destroy or adversely modify wetlands.  The AF will fully disclose the location of known wetlands, and any land-use restrictions imposed by regulatory authority, on lands that are leased, transferred or sold to non-federal entities. 4.1.1.  Baseline Wetlands Inventory.  Develop a baseline inventory and map that indicates the location  of  known  wetlands,  water  bodies,  and  waterways  on  lands  controlled  by  the  AF.  The  baseline  wetlands  inventory  would  include  all  wetland  areas,  regardless  of  regulatory status.  Installations are not required to update existing wetland inventory maps unless there exists a change in hydrology or in the wetland delineation methodology. 4.1.2.  Finding  of  No  Practicable  Alternative  (FONPA).  DoDI  4715.03,  Natural  Resources Conservation  Program,  Clean  Water  Act  Sections  401,  404  and  404(b)(1)  Guidelines,  and provisions  of  E.O.  11990,  prohibits  agencies  from  undertaking  or  supporting  any  new construction  or  related  activities  located  in  wetlands,  unless  the  head  of  the  agency,  or  the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, or an official duly delegated authority to act on his/her behalf, for ANG, finds that (1) there is no practicable alternative to such new construction or related  activities,  and  (2)  that  the  proposed  action  includes  all  practicable  measures  to minimize harm to the wetlands from such use. 4.1.2.1.  The  FONPA  is  a  finding  contained  within  a  NEPA  Finding  of  No  Significant Impact (FONSI) or Record of Decision (ROD) (ref. 32 CFR 989.14(g)), explaining why there are no practicable alternatives to an action affecting a wetland, as established in an appropriate  level  NEPA  analysis  (see  section  4.4.2.).    This  finding  is  made  by  the Secretary of the Air Force or an official who has been duly delegated the authority to act on the Secretary’s behalf or the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, or an official duly delegated authority to act on his/her behalf, for ANG. 4.1.2.2.  To  support  the  required  FONPA,  prior  to  any  new  construction  or  related activities located in wetlands, proponents first prepare an analysis and documentation, in accordance  with  CWA  Sections  401,  404  and  404(b)(1)  Guidelines,  Dodi  4715.03, Natural  Resources  Conservation  Program,  and  provisions  of  E.O.  11990,  that demonstrates no practicable alternatives to such construction or activities exist, and that the proposed action includes all practicable measures to minimize harm to wetlands. This required  assessment  of  proposed  actions  potentially  affecting  wetlands  will  follow  the process outlined in Section 4.4. (T-0). 4.1.2.3.  When  there  is  no  practicable  alternative  to  taking  an  action  in  a  wetland,  a FONPA determination is made by the Secretary of the Air Force, or an official who has been  duly  delegated  the  authority  to  act  on  the  Secretary’s  behalf  or  the  Chief  of  the National  Guard  Bureau,  or  an  official  duly  delegated  authority  to  act  on  his/her  behalf, for ANG, via signature on the FONSI or ROD (section 4.4.3.). AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 21 4.1.3.  Coastal  Zone  Management  Act  Consistency.    Proposed  actions  in  wetlands  may require a Coastal Zone Management Act consistency determination.  Refer to Chapter 6 for further guidance. 4.2.  Clean Water Act (CWA) Compliance.  Activities that may impact waters and wetlands of the  United States as defined in  Title 40, C.F.R. §110.1, require evaluation for compliance with CWA regulations. 4.2.1.  Jurisdictional Wetlands Delineation.  Jurisdictional wetlands are those wetlands, water bodies  and  waterways  that  fulfill  the  criteria  as  jurisdictional  waters  of  the  United  States subject  to  the  regulatory  requirements  of  the  CWA.    Site  level  jurisdictional  wetland delineations are mandatory for proposed development activities that may affect wetlands, and are the responsibility of the proponent as part of project costs.  The proponent of any activity that  may  affect  known  or  suspected  wetlands  should  conduct  a  jurisdictional  wetland delineation  utilizing  the  criteria  approved  by  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  and affirmed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).  The AF will refer to and accept as determinative  the  current  USACE  definitions  for  wetlands  under  USACE  jurisdiction.  Jurisdictional  delineations  are  valid  for  a  limited  period  of  time,  as  established  by  the USACE  District  Regulatory  Office.    Installations  are  not  required  to  update  an  expired jurisdictional  wetland  delineation  unless  there  exists  a  proposed  mission  activity  that necessitates  an  updated  demarcation  of  jurisdictional  wetland  boundaries  by  the  proponent activity. 4.2.2.  CWA  Section  404  Compliance.    Section  404  of  the  CWA  establishes  a  program  to regulate  the  discharge  of  dredged  or  fill  material  into  jurisdictional  waters  and  wetlands  of the  United  States.    Actions  that  may  impact  wetlands,  to  include  dredging,  filling,  and activities that may displace soil or other materials into a wetland, may require a 404 permit from  the  USACE.    Submit  USACE  ENG  Form  4345,  Application  for  Department  of  the Army  Permit  to  the  appropriate  USACE  District  Engineer  prior  to  any  land  disturbance activity located in or near a regulated wetland area or regulated waters of the United States.  Along  with  the  permit  application,  submit  a  vicinity  map  and  site  development  plan  that includes  a  cross-sectional  view  of  the  affected  area  showing  limits  of  jurisdictional  waters, the normal water level, volume of fill material to be discharged below ordinary high water, and  the  area  of  waters  affected.    In  some  states,  the  authority  to  issue  CWA  Section  404 permits has been delegated to the state. 4.2.3.  CWA Section 401 Compliance.  Section 401 of the CWA directs that any proponent of  an  action  that  requires  a  federal  license  or  permit,  such  as  a  Section  404  or  National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit, must obtain a Water Quality Certificate from the  state  water  pollution  control  agency.    The  Water  Quality  Certificate  certifies  that  the action complies with state water quality criteria.  State permits to undertake projects within a specified  buffer  zone  surrounding  wetlands  may  also  be  required.    When  applying  for  a permit under state wetland protection laws, certain information not required for an USACE permit, such as a delineation of a regulated buffer area, may also be required.  In some cases, permit  applications  may  be  submitted  concurrently  for  review  by  both  the  state  and  the USACE. 4.3.  Rivers  and  Harbors  Act  of  1899  Compliance.  The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. §401, establishes a program to regulate activities affecting navigable waters of the United 22 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 States.  Section 10 of the Act (33 U.S.C.§403) directs that proponents must obtain a Section 10 permit  administered  by  the  U.  S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  for  construction, excavation, or deposition of materials in, over, or under navigable waters, or for any work which would  affect  the  course,  location,  condition,  or  capacity  of  those  waters.    Activities  requiring Section 10 permits include structures (e.g., piers, wharves, breakwaters, bulkheads, jetties, weirs, transmission  lines)  and  work  such  as  dredging  or  disposal  of  dredged  material,  or  excavation, filling, or other modifications to the navigable waters of the United States.  Contact the USACE prior  to  construction  or  other  activities  that  may  affect  open  water  habitats  to  determine  if  a Section 10 permit is necessary. 4.4.  EIAP  for  Actions that May  Affect Wetlands  .  Proposed actions (i.e. new construction) that  may  affect  wetlands  require  full  compliance  with  the  EIAP,  CWA  Sections  401,  404  and 404(b)(1) Guidelines, and E.O. 11990 prior to implementation. 4.4.1.  Proponents  shall  take  action  to  minimize  the  destruction,  loss,  or  degradation  of wetlands  and  to  preserve  and  enhance  the  natural  and  beneficial  values  of  wetlands  in carrying out their responsibilities. (T-0). 4.4.2.  Ensure  supporting  NEPA  documentation  includes  consideration  of  alternatives  to actions potentially affecting wetlands. For such actions that are being initially evaluated in an Environmental Assessments (EA), an NOI will be prepared per 32 C.F.R. Part 989.17 and a public scoping process will be initiated per 32 C.F.R. Part 989.18 that at a minimum solicits written comments from the public, to ensure early and meaningful public involvement under Section 2(b) of E.O. 11990 and 32 C.F.R. Part 989.14(l). (T-0). 4.4.2.1.  A  determination  as  to  whether,  or  not,  to  conduct  a  scoping  meeting  under  32 C.F.R. §989.18 or hold a public meeting or public hearing on the Draft EA will be made based upon public comments received during the written scoping process, the magnitude of the proposed action, and its potential for controversy.  (T-0). 4.4.2.2.  The NOI will include a description of the action, its purpose, and expressly state the  proposed  action  is  subject  to  the  Clean  Water  Act  Sections  401,  404  and  404(b)(1) Guidelines, and the requirements and objectives of E.O. 11990, "Protection of Wetlands”.  The  NOI  shall  identify  state  and  federal  regulatory  agencies  with  jurisdiction  and  or special  expertise that  have been  contacted and request  public comment  on the  proposed action and any practicable alternatives. (T-0).  4.4.3.  For  such  actions  initially  considered  for  an  Environmental  Assessment  (EA),  early public notice will be prepared and made available to the public in accordance with 32 C.F.R. Part 989.24(c). At a minimum, ensure the notice solicits written comments from the public to encourage early and meaningful public involvement.  Refer to E.O. 11990, Section 2(b) and 32 C.F.R. Part 989.14(l).  Ensure the early public notice includes a description of the action, its  purpose  and  expressly  states  the  proposed  action  is  subject  to  the  requirements  and objectives of E.O. 11990 because its new construction in wetlands.  Additionally, ensure this notice  identifies  state  and  federal  regulatory  agencies  with  special  expertise  that  have  been contacted  and  request  public  comment  on  the  proposed  action  and  any  practicable alternatives.  Whenever practicable, the notice should provide 30 days for public comment. When the analysis reveals a significant impact that cannot be mitigated to insignificance, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) following the procedures of 32 C.F.R. Parts 989.17-989.21  is  required.  In  cases  where  there  is  no  practicable  alternative  to  the  proposed  new AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 23 construction in the wetland, a FONPA determination is made within the supporting Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) or Record of Decision (ROD) by the Secretary of the Air Force,  or  an  official  who  has  been  duly  delegated  the  authority  to  act  on  the  Secretary’s behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  or  the  Chief  of  the  National  Guard  Bureau,  or  an official duly delegated authority to act on his/her behalf, for ANG. 4.4.4.  Application  of  a  Categorical  Exclusion  (CATEX)  to  new  construction  located  in  a wetland  is  normally  not  appropriate,  given  the  additional  analysis  requirements  under  Air Force regulations (See Section A2.2.7 of Appendix B to 32 C.F.R. Part 989) and the level of public involvement required as described above.  For the purposes of this section, the Clean Water Act Sections 401, 404 and 404(b)(1) Guidelines, as well as E.O. 11990 Sections 7(c) and 7(b) respectively, define “wetlands” and “new construction”. (T-0). 4.5.  Wetland Mitigation Banks.  A wetland mitigation bank is a wetland area that is currently being  created,  restored,  or  enhanced,  and  set  aside  to  compensate  for  future  actions  that  may negatively impact other wetlands within the same watershed and provide like (in-kind) wetland functions.  A wetland bank is established by means of a formal agreement with the  Army Corps of  Engineers  or  other  appropriate  regulatory  agency(ies)  enacted  prior  to  nomination  of  a wetland  to  the  program.    The  value  of  a  bank  is  determined  through  cooperation  with  the regulating  agency  to  quantify  the  wetland  values  restored,  enhanced,  or  created  in  terms  of compensatory mitigation credits.  Development of off-installation wetland mitigation banks, and purchase of credits from certified third-party mitigation banks, is encouraged when practicable as a  cost-effective  method  to  reduce  the  uncertainty  and  delays  that  may  be  associated  with mitigation  requirements  for  future  installation  development.    Costs  associated  with  wetland mitigation banking may be treated as eligible project costs for military construction. 24 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 5 FLOODPLAINS 5.1.  Floodplain Protection.  Executive Order 13690, Establishing a Federal Risk Management Standard  and  a  Process  for  Further  Soliciting  and  Considering  Stakeholder  Input  (30  January 2015),  requires  all  federal  agencies  to  provide  leadership  and  take  action  to  reduce  the  risk  of flood loss, minimize the impacts of floods on human safety, health, and welfare, and restore and preserve the natural and beneficial values of floodplains when acquiring, managing, or disposing of federal lands. 5.2.  Floodplain Boundary Determination.  Use the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) maps distributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to determine whether a proposed action occurs in a floodplain.  If NFIP maps are not available for the affected area, installations  will  develop  a  flood  plain  map  that  is  certified  by  a  professional  engineer,  and provide the map data to the NFIP.  (T-1). 5.3.  Assessment of Proposed Actions within a Floodplain. 5.3.1.  EIAP for Actions that May Affect Floodplains.  Proposed actions that will occur in, or could  adversely  affect  floodplains,  require  compliance  with  the  EIAP  and  E.O.  11988 “Floodplain Management” prior to implementing an action.  Proponents shall, during initial planning and design, reduce the risk of flood loss; minimize the impact of floods on human safety, health and welfare and the Air Force mission; and restore or preserve the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains. (T-0). 5.3.1.1.  Ensure  NEPA  documentation  reflects  consideration  of  alternatives  to  actions proposed  in  floodplains,  which  potentially  adversely  affect  floodplains  or  increase  the risk  of  flood  loss,  as  well  as  measures  necessary  to  minimize  potential  harm  to  the floodplain or reduce the risk of loss in accordance with 40 C.F.R. §1508.20 and 32 C.F.R. Part  989.22(a).    For  such  actions  initially  considered  for  an  Environmental  Assessment (EA), prepare early public notice and make available to the public in accordance with 32 C.F.R. Part 989.24(c).  At a minimum, ensure the notice solicits written comments from the public to encourage early and meaningful public involvement.  Refer to E.O. 11988, Section  2(a)(4)  and  32  C.F.R.  Part  989.14(l).    Ensure  the  early  public  notice  includes  a description of the action, its purpose and expressly states the proposed action is subject to the  requirements  and  objectives  of  E.O.  11988  because  its  intended  locations  in  the floodplain.    Additionally,  ensure  this  notice  identifies  state  and  federal  regulatory agencies with special expertise that have been contacted and request public comment on the  proposed  action  and  any  practicable  alternatives.    Whenever  practicable,  the  notice should provide 30 days for public comment. 5.3.1.2.  Pursuant to 32 C.F.R. Part 989.14 (l), the EPF reviews the input received from the early public notice process.  Based on the magnitude and complexity of the proposed action and the public comments, if any, received during the early public notice process, the EPF determines whether or not to initiate an EIS or EA. 5.3.1.2.1.  If  an  analysis  determines  that  an  EA  is  to  be  accomplished,  the  EA  and unsigned  Finding  of  No  Significant  Impact  (FONSI)  is  made  available  for  public review  for  at  least  30  days  per  32  C.F.R.  Part  989.15(e)(2)  and  the  public  notice  of AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 25 availability should meet the requirements of 32 C.F.R. Part 989.24(c).  The EPF may also conduct a public meeting on the Draft EA. 5.3.1.2.2.  If  the  analysis  reveals  a  significant  adverse  impact,  or  an  Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is undertaken initially, follow the procedures for EISs in 32 C.F.R.  Part  989.17-21.    When  there  is  no  practicable  alternative  to  taking  an  action within a floodplain, make a Finding of No Practicable Alternative (FONPA) either in the supporting FONSI or Record of Decision (ROD). 5.3.1.2.3.  Application of Categorical Exclusions (CATEXs) to actions located in, or adversely  affecting  floodplains  is  normally  not  appropriate,  given  the  additional analysis requirements under Air Force regulations (See Section A2.2.7 of Appendix B to  32  C.F.R.  Part  989)  and  the  level  of  public  involvement  required  as  described above. 5.3.2.  Actions that Alter Floodplain Hydrology.  If an action is taken within a floodplain that permanently  alters  the  flood  hazard  delineations  on  a  NFIP  map,  prepare  and  submit recommended map modification to FEMA. 26 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 6 COASTAL AND MARINE RESOURCES 6.1.  Protection  of  Coastal  and  Marine  Resources.  The  AF  will  conserve  and  protect  all coastal  and  marine  resources  whenever  feasible  as  part  of  the  overall  natural  resources management program. 6.2.  Coastal  Zone  Management  Act  (CZMA)  Compliance.  The  Coastal  Zone  Management Act  (Title  16  U.S.C.§§1451-1462)  authorizes  coastal  states  to  establish  a  Coastal  Zone Management  Program  (CZMP)  to  coordinate  state,  local,  and  federal  programs  for  the management of coastal  areas.   The National  Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration’s  Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management administers the program at the federal level.  Once a  state’s  program  is  federally  approved,  the  CZMA  allows  participating  states  to  set  goals  and procedures that control the use and development of designated Coastal Zones. 6.2.1.  Applicability.  A Coastal Zone is the area specified or delineated by a state within its federally  approved  Coastal  Zone  Management  Program.    All  AF  activities,  operations, projects,  and  programs  that  affect  any  lands,  water  use  or  natural  resources  of  a  state’s Coastal  Zone  must  be  consistent  to  the  maximum  extent  practicable  with  the  state  CZMP.  For AF installations within a Coastal Zone management area, the INRMP must specifically address how activities and operations are consistent with the state CZMP. (T-0). 6.2.2.  Federal Consistency Determination.  Installations must prepare a Federal Consistency Determination  to  assess  consistency  with  the  state  CZMP  for  any  activity,  regardless  of location, that is likely to affect any land, water, or natural resource of a Coastal Zone in the reasonably  foreseeable  future.    (T-0).    The  installation  submits  a  Federal  Consistency Determination  to  the  appropriate  state  agency  (e.g.  Coastal  Zone  Coordination  Council)  at least  90  days  before  final  approval  of  the  proposed  action,  unless  otherwise  agreed  upon.  The state produces a federal consistency review response indicating whether or not the state concurs  with  the  determination.    Ensure  actions  requiring  consistency  determinations  are fully  considered  and  addressed  in  applicable  NEPA  documentation.    Analysis  of  the proposed action, and the purpose for the proposed action, are addressed no later than the draft version of the NEPA documentation, and provided to the applicable State office for review and comment.  The state response becomes part of the EIAP documentation for the proposed project. 6.3.  Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982 Compliance.  The Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Title  16  U.S.C.  §§3501-3510)  regulates  the  expenditure  of  federal  funds  to  discourage development  within  boundaries  of  undeveloped,  unprotected  coastal  barriers  (such  as  a  bay barrier, barrier spit, or barrier island) on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, as identified in the Coastal Barriers  Resources  System  maps  established  by  the  Act.    Federal  funds  may  be  used  for permissible activities listed in 16 U.S.C. §3505, which include national security related military actions and the management, protection and enhancement of natural resources, and maintenance of  existing  structures  for  navigation  and  shoreline  stabilization.    Proponents  consult  with  the USFWS when planning activities and operations that may impact lands identified in the Coastal Barriers Resources System. AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 27 6.4.  Marine  Mammal  Protection  Act  of  1972  Compliance.  The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16  U.S.C.  §§1361  - 1421(h))  protects marine mammals, their  critical habitat,  and migratory  routes.    Installations  with  marine  resources  must  address  the  protection  of  marine mammals  in  the  INRMP  and  submit  the  INRMP  to  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service for review.  (T-0).  Any action undertaken by the AF in a marine or coastal environment, to include activities that generate noise, requires an assessment  of  the  potential  impact  on  marine  mammals  before  they  begin.    Proponents  whose activities may impact marine mammals coordinate the proposed actions with NOAA Fisheries. 6.5.  Coral  Reef  Protection.  Executive  Order  13089,  Coral  Reef  Protection,  June  11,  1998 directs  the  protection  of  all  coral  reef  ecosystems,  to  include  those  species,  habitats,  and  other natural  resources  associated  with  coral  reefs  within  all  maritime  areas  and  zones  subject to  the jurisdiction  or  control  of  the  United  States  (e.g.,  federal,  state,  territorial,  or  commonwealth waters).    Installations  identify  all  coral  reefs  and  related  endemic  mangrove  and  sea  grass ecosystems  in  the  INRMP.    Installations  with  these  protected  ecosystems  must  address  the conservation and management of these habitats in the INRMP. (T-0). 6.6.  Coastal  America  Partnership.  The  Department  of  Defense  and  other  federal  agencies with  statutory  responsibilities  for  coastal  resources  formed  the  Coastal  America  Partnership  by Memorandums of Understanding in 1992, 1994, and 2002.  The purpose of the Coastal America Partnership  is  to  (1)  protect,  preserve,  and  restore  the  Nation’s  coastal  ecosystems  through existing federal capabilities and authorities; (2) collaborate and cooperate in the stewardship of coastal living marine resources; and (3) provide a framework for action that effectively focuses expertise  and  resources  on  jointly  identified  problems  to  produce  demonstrable  environmental and  programmatic  results  that  may  serve  as  models  for  effective  management  of  coastal resources.    In  support  of  the  Coastal  America  Partnership,  AF  installations  are  encouraged  to coordinate  and  cooperate  with  partners  in  support  of  regional  programs  for  the  protection  and restoration  of  coastal  ecosystems,  and  to  incorporate  Coastal  America  goals  within  the installation  Integrated  Natural  Resources  Management  Plan  when  compatible  with  statutory authorities and military mission activities.  Collaborative projects that protect or restore coastal resources on Air Force installations may be submitted for consideration to the Coastal America Awards Program. 28 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 7 FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT 7.1.  Wildlife  Management  Programs  on  Air  Force  Lands.  The  INRMP  should  address  the management  of  game  and  non-game  fish  and  wildlife  on  AF  installations,  to  include  any requirement  to  inventory  and  monitor  fish  and  wildlife  resources.    Prepare  the  INRMP  in cooperation  with  the  USFWS,  state  fish  and  wildlife  agency,  and  NOAA  Fisheries  for installations  that  include  or  are  adjacent  to  marine  environments.    Installations  will  ensure  the resulting plan reflects the mutual agreement of the installation and the cooperating agencies for the conservation, protection, and management of wildlife resources (see 3.3).  (T-0). 7.2.  Hunting, Fishing, Trapping and Outdoor Recreation Programs. 7.2.1.  Program  Management.    The  Sikes  Act,  16  U.S.C.  §670a(a)(3)(A),  requires  that, consistent  with  the  use  of  a  military  installations  to  ensure  the  preparedness  of  the  Armed Forces, military installations provide for the sustainable multipurpose use of the resources, to include  hunting,  fishing,  trapping,  and  non-consumptive  recreational  access.    Hunting, fishing,  trapping  and  dispersed  outdoor  recreation  programs  are  appropriate  on  AF installations when they are consistent with INRMP goals for natural resources management, and  are  in  accordance  with  installation  security  and  safety  requirements.    Ensure  fish  and game harvests comply with all federal and state laws and regulations, and are consistent with DoD  principles  for  ecosystem  management  and  biodiversity  conservation.    The  designated installation  or  IST  natural  resources  manager  is  responsible  for  direction  and  oversight  of hunting  and  fishing  programs.    Administrative  and  management  costs  associated  with hunting, fishing,  trapping and the management of outdoor recreation access should be fully reimbursed by user fees.  Installations may utilize the voluntary assistance of others to help manage  hunting  and  fishing  programs,  to  include  units  of  the  Air  Force  Personnel  Center Directorate of Services, Force Support Squadrons, and non-AF affiliated clubs (e.g. Rod and Gun  Club);  but  these  organizations  may  not  direct  activities  related  to  hunting,  fishing, trapping  and  outdoor  recreation  that  are  outside  the  scope  and  direction  of  the  installation INRMP.  Program support provided by a Force Support Squadron may be reimbursed from user fees. 7.2.2.  Fee  Collection.    Hunting,  fishing,  trapping  and  outdoor  recreation  access  fees  are collected  by  the  installation  and  deposited  into  the  AF  account  for  fish  and  wildlife management  (57  5095).    The  INRMP  should  address  the  installation  procedures  for  the collection of fees for hunting, fishing, trapping and access to outdoor recreation areas.  Use DoD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher to report cash collections to 57 5095.  If the Air Force  Personnel  Center  Directorate  of  Services,  Force,  or  other  organization  assists  the natural  resources  management  program  office  with  the  collection  of  user  fees,  account  for any administrative fees charged separately from fees collected into the 57 5095 account.  In such  case,  the  permit  issued  identifies  the  portion  of  the  fee  payment  that  represents  the seller’s  administrative  charge.    Upon  termination  of  a  fee  collection  program  for  hunting, fishing,  trapping,  or  outdoor  recreation,  installations  must  notify  AFCEC/CZ  and  close  the collection account.  (T-0). AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 29 7.2.3.  Access  and  Participation.    The  INRMP  should  address  the  specific  rules  and procedures  for  authorized  participation  and  access  to  AF  installations  for  hunting,  fishing, trapping  and  dispersed  outdoor  recreation.    The  INRMP  should  identify  access  areas  by category,  and  the  authorized  participants  for  each  access  area  category,  using  the  criteria established  below.    A  commander  may  restrict  or  exclude  hunting,  fishing  and  trapping  if such  activity  is  not  compatible  with  the  military  mission.    When  access  is  denied  to  the general public, include the rationale for that determination in the INRMP 7.2.3.1.  Access  Categories.    Installations  with  unimproved  lands  will  identify  in  the INRMP  the  availability  of  lands,  by  access  category,  for  hunting,  fishing,  trapping  and other dispersed outdoor recreation activities.  (T-3).  The INRMP establishes the criteria used  to  designate  lands  into  each  access  category,  and  identifies  how  access  category designations  may change with  each  Force Protection Condition  (Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie,  Delta)  imposed  on  the  installation.  Refer  to  AFI  13-212,  Volume  1,  Range Planning and Operations for guidance on access to military ranges.  There are three basic access area categories. 7.2.3.1.1.  Open Areas.  Unrestricted areas on the installation where hunting, fishing, trapping and outdoor recreation are permitted to all participants. 7.2.3.1.2.  Restricted  Areas.    Areas  designated  by  the  commander  where  hunting, fishing,  trapping  and  outdoor  recreation  are  permitted  to  certain  categories  of participants  or  under  special  arrangements  as  defined  by  the  commander.    The INRMP  should  state  the  rationale  by  which  access  to  an  area  is  limited  to  certain categories of participants. 7.2.3.1.3.  Off Limits Areas.  Areas designated by the commander as being off limits to  recreational  hunting,  fishing,  trapping  and  dispersed  outdoor  recreation  by  any person  at  any  time.    These  are  areas  where  mission  security  and  safety  concerns  do not allow such use.  The INRMP should state the rationale by which access to an area is designated to be off limits due to safety considerations. 7.2.3.2.  Participant  Categories.    The  INRMP  should  establish  criteria  and  protocols addressing user access and conduct for open and restricted areas by Participant Category.  Do  not  confuse  these  Participant  Categories  with  the  Eligibility  Categories  described  in AFI  34-101  Air  Force  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  (MWR)  Program  and  Use Eligibility.   Base installation policy for hunting, fishing, trapping, and non-consumptive recreational  access  indicated  in  the  Sikes  Act  (16  U.S.C.  §670a(a)(3)(A))  upon  safety, mission requirements, and the ability of the natural ecosystem to sustain these activities.  For  open  and  restricted  areas,  ensure  the  INRMP  identifies  access  privileges  for  the following categories of participants: 7.2.3.2.1.  Active Duty Military (includes Reserve and National Guard on active duty or full time manning) 7.2.3.2.2.  Department of Defense Civilians 7.2.3.2.3.  Active Duty Military Dependents and Family Members 7.2.3.2.4.  Military Retirees 7.2.3.2.5.  Department of Defense Civilian Retirees 30 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 7.2.3.2.6.  Employees of Installation Prime Contractors (defined as a contractor with a five or more year term contract). 7.2.3.2.7.  General Public. 7.3.  Conservation  Law  Enforcement.  Commanders  are  responsible  for  the  enforcement  of state and federal fish and game laws on AF installations.  In accordance with the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C.  §670a(b)(1)(H),  installations  must  address  the  enforcement  of  applicable  natural resources laws in the INRMP.  (T-0). DoDI 5525.17, Conservation Law Enforcement Programs (CLEP)  provides  guidance  for  conservation  law  enforcement  on  Department  of  Defense installations. 7.3.1.  Cooperative  Law  Enforcement.    Commanders  should  provide  reasonable  access  to federal and state conservation officers  for the  purpose of fish and wildlife law enforcement on  AF  installations.    Commanders  are  authorized  to  enter  into  law  enforcement  support agreements on a reimbursable basis with federal and state agencies having responsibility and jurisdiction for conservation law enforcement. 7.3.2.  Fish and Wildlife Law Enforcement by Air Force Personnel.  The Sikes Act, Section 106 (16 U.S.C. §670e-1) authorizes the Department of Defense to enforce all federal natural resources laws on military installations.  The commander may designate military and civilian personnel  as  fish  and  wildlife  law  enforcement  officers  only  if  those  persons  have  been certified  in  conservation  law  enforcement  through  successful  completion  of  the  Land Management  Police  Training  course  at  the  Federal  Law  Enforcement  Training  Center  or, alternatively, have been commissioned as a fish and wildlife conservation officer in the state where  the  installation  is  located.    Law  enforcement  personnel  who  do  not  possess  either federal or state fish and wildlife enforcement certification can be used to supplement fish and wildlife law enforcement under the direct supervision of certified personnel. 7.4.  Protection of Migratory Birds.  In accordance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (Title  16  U.S.C.  §§703-712)  and  Executive  Order  No.  13186,  Responsibilities  of  Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds, January 10, 2001, avoid or minimize the negative impact of AF  actions  on  migratory  birds.    This  includes  preventing  or  abating  pollution  or  detrimental alteration of the environment, and incorporating migratory bird conservation into the installation INRMP  as  practicable.    Installations  will  notify  the  USFWS  if  unintentional  take  of  migratory birds reasonably attributable to AF actions is having, or is likely to have, a measurable negative effect on migratory bird populations; and implement conservation measures as specified in E.O. 13186, Section 3(e)(9). (T-0). 7.4.1.  Intentional  Takes  of  Migratory  Birds.    Any  proposal  to  intentionally  kill,  wound, capture, or collect a migratory bird requires a migratory bird depredation permit issued by the USFWS  IAW  Title  50,  C.F.R.  §  21.41.    Depredation  of  migratory  birds  is  also  subject  to NEPA  (42  U.S.C.§4321  et  seq.)  and  the  Air  Force  EIAP  at  32  C.F.R.  §  989.    Once  a depredation  permit  is  issued,  installations  will  maintain  records  and  submit  reports  as mandated under the terms of the permit. (T-0). 7.4.2.  Incidental  Takes  of  Migratory  Birds  During  Military  Readiness  Activity.    In accordance with Section 315 of the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act of 2003 (P.L. 107-314), Migratory Bird Treaty Act requirements indicated in 16 U.S.C. §703 do not apply to the incidental taking of a migratory bird by a member of the Armed Forces during a AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 31 military  readiness  activity.    A  military  readiness  activity,  as  defined  at  50  C.F.R.  §  21.3, includes  all  training  and  operations  that  relate  to  combat.  It  does  not  include  routine operation  of  support  functions,  operation  of  industrial  activities,  or  construction  or demolition  of  support  or  industrial  facilities.    Ensure  incidental  takes  during  military readiness  activities  conform  to  the  regulations  in  50  C.F.R.  §21.15,  which  authorizes incidental  take  of  migratory  birds  for  military  readiness  activities  provided  that  a determination  is  made  by  means  of  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  process  (32 C.F.R. Part 989) that the proposed readiness action does not have significant negative effects on  a  population  of  migratory  birds.    If  it  is  determined  that  the  readiness  action  has significant  negative effects on a population  of  migratory birds, the  installation confers with the  USFWS  to  develop  and  implement  appropriate  conservation  measures  to  minimize  and mitigate,  to  the  extent  practicable,  adverse  impacts  of  military  readiness  activities  on migratory  birds;  and  to  monitor  the  impacts  of  such  activities  on  affected  migratory  bird species.  Not all operations and maintenance activities on an installation qualify as a military readiness activity.  Seek legal advice if uncertain whether an activity qualifies as a military readiness  activity  consistent  with  50  C.F.R.  §21.15.  Vegetation  management  within  the airfield Clear Zones and Primary Surface, as defined in UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design, is a military readiness activity covered under 50 C.F.R. §21.15. 7.5.  Bald  and  Golden  Eagle  Protection  Act.  The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C.    668-668c)  prohibits  harm  or  harassment  to  bald  and  golden  eagles.    This  includes removal of inactive nests as well as active nests.  In accordance with 50 C.F.R. §22, installations must  obtain  a  permit  from  the  USFWS  if  an  activity  may  result  in  "take"  of  a  bald  or  golden eagle as  defined in  the regulations.   (T-0).  Eagle permits authorize take only in  circumstances where  the  take  cannot  be  practicably  avoided  in  the  course  of  an  otherwise  lawful  activity.  Conditions of the permit may include mitigative actions to minimize impacts. 7.6.  Wildlife Damage Control. 7.6.1.  Nuisance  Wildlife  Control.    Installation  pest  management  personnel  have  primary responsibility for the control of nuisance wildlife species, although the program can receive substantial support from natural resources management personnel for control of wildlife that requires specialized training and permits. 7.6.1.1.  Contact  the  state  fish  and  wildlife  agency  prior  to  killing  or  trapping  nuisance wildlife.    Wildlife  control  activities  may  require  a  state  depredation  permit.    Activities that affect migratory birds may require a federal permit (see 7.4.1.).  Any action that may affect a species listed for protection under the auspices of the ESA requires consultation with the USFWS (see Chapter 8). 7.6.1.2.  The  INRMP  should  address  nuisance  wildlife  control  objectives,  appropriate control  techniques,  and  the  installation  organizations  responsible  for  each  aspect  of nuisance  wildlife  control.    The  installation  INRMP,  Integrated  Pest  Management  Plan, Solid Waste Management Plan, and Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Plan should be mutually  supportive,  and  adequately  differentiate  the  responsibilities  for  natural resources,  pest  management,  flight  safety,  public  health,  and  veterinary  services personnel  for  the  control  of  nuisance  wildlife.    Include  procedures  for  animal  carcass disposal. 32 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 7.6.2.  Wildlife  Control  in  Support  of  Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  Reduction.    The INRMP  and  Bird/wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  Plan  and  incorporate  the  guidance  within AFI 91-202, USAF Mishap Prevention Program and Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 91-212, BASH  Management  Techniques.    Coordinate  draft  INRMPs  and  updates  with  airfield operations  and  flight  safety  personnel  to  ensure  conformance  with  airfield  safety  criteria.  Request assistance for BASH related wildlife control issues from personnel at Headquarters Air  Force  Safety  Center  (AFSEC/SEFW).    See  Chapter  15  for  additional  BASH  program requirements. 7.6.3.  Emergency Wildlife Control.  Emergency wildlife control measures may be warranted if unanticipated wildlife problems endanger installation operations or threaten public health.  Ensure  the  installation  INRMP,  consistent  with  the  Integrated  Pest  Management  Plan  and BASH  Plan,  identifies  the  protocols  and  notification  requirements  for  emergency  wildlife control consistent with the terms of federal and state depredation permits. 7.7.  Participation  in  Conservation  Banking  Programs  .    An  installation  may  enter  into agreements for, and make payments to, an off-installation conservation banking program or other “in-lieu-fee”  mitigation  sponsor,  to  satisfy  a  mitigation  responsibility  necessary  for  new construction or other military activity that has the potential to adversely impact species protected under  the  ESA  or  Migratory  Bird  Treaty  Act.    Payments  made  to  a  conservation  banking program or “in-lieu-fee” mitigation sponsor for the purpose of facilitating military construction may be treated as eligible costs of the military construction project. AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 33 Chapter 8 THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES MANAGEMENT 8.1.  ESA  Compliance.  The  ESA,  (Title  16  U.S.C.    §§1531-1544),  requires  protection  and conservation  of  federally  listed  threatened  and  endangered  (T&E)  plants  and  animals  and  their habitats.  Section 7(a)(1) of the ESA states that all federal departments and agencies shall utilize their  respective  authorities  to  conserve  threatened  and  endangered  species.    Conservation includes the use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring any T&E species to the point where the measures pursuant to the ESA are no longer necessary. 8.1.1.  Federally Listed Species.  Installations known to sustain federally listed T&E species or their habitats must address T&E species conservation in the INRMP.   (T-0).  Ensure the INRMP  goals  and  objectives  provide  an  overall  ecosystem  management  strategy  for  the protection and recovery of T&E species.  When practical, provide similar protection to plants and animals that are candidate species for protection by federal listing.  Ensure the INRMP includes  provisions  addressing  the  requisite  "benefit  to  the  species"  criteria  to  support  a critical habitat exemption (see 8.4). 8.1.2.  State  Listed  Species.    INRMPs  provide  for  the  protection  and  conservation  of  state listed protected species when practicable.  Although not required by the ESA, provide similar conservation measures for species protected by state law when such protection is not in direct conflict with the military mission.  When conflicts occur, consult with the appropriate state authority to determine if any conservation measures can be feasibly implemented to mitigate impacts. 8.1.3.  Host Nation Protected Species.  For installations and AF operations outside the United States  and  its  territories,  responsibility  for  protection  of  host  nation  protected  species  is  as specified  in  the  Final  Governing  Standards  for  the  host  country  (refer  to  AFI  32-7091, Environmental Management Outside the United State). 8.2.  Inventory and Monitoring.  All installations will conduct a basic reconnaissance survey to determine the presence of any federally listed Threatened, Endangered or Candidate species on an installation.  (T-1).  Determine the survey methodology, scope, and species considered in the inventory after consultation with the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries, depending upon jurisdiction.  Follow-up reconnaissance  surveys are  necessary if the  USFWS or  NOAA Fisheries determines that  a  new  federally  listed  species  may  occur  on  the  installation.    Periodic  resurveys  and monitoring  of  known  listed  species  are  necessary  if  they  are  stipulated  in:  (1)  the  ‘Terms  and Conditions’  that  implement  the  ‘Reasonable  and  Prudent’  conservation  measures  rendered  in  a Biological  Opinion  from  the  USFWS  or  NOAA  Fisheries,  (2)  a  USFWS  or  NOAA  Fisheries Species  Recovery  Plan,  or  (3)  an  INRMP,  coordinated  and  approved  in  accordance  with  the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C.  §670a-f).  Share all information collected on military lands and waters that pertains  to  a  federally  listed  Threatened,  Endangered,  and  Candidate  species  with  the  USFWS and/or  NOAA  Fisheries.    If  practical,  share  known  information  on  state  listed  species  with  the relevant state agency (e.g. state Department of Natural Resources or Natural Heritage Program) for inclusion in their biological and conservation database. 8.3.  Interagency Consultation and Coordination. 34 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 8.3.1.  Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation.  Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA requires agencies to consult with the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries when proposed or ongoing actions, including the implementation of an INRMP, may affect a listed species or its habitat, action may affect a listed  species.  Consult  with  the USFWS  for terrestrial species and freshwater aquatic  species,  and  with  NOAA  Fisheries  for  saltwater  fish  and  marine  mammals.  Attachment  4  outlines  standard  consultation  procedures.    Installations  must  notify  the AFCEC  Installation  Support  Team  when  entering  into  formal  consultations  under  the auspices of the ESA. (T-0). 8.3.2.  Marine  Mammal  Protection  Act  Consultation.    Consult  with  NOAA  Fisheries  or  the USFWS when an ongoing or proposed activity, including the preparation and implementation of an INRMP, has the potential to impact marine mammals protected under the authority of the  Marine  Mammal  Protection  Act  as  specified  in  Title16,  U.S.C.    §§  1361-1421h.    This requirement may be in addition to ESA consultation requirements. 8.3.3.  INRMP Coordination.  Send all INRMPs and draft revisions to  the USFWS, NOAA Fisheries  (if  applicable),  and  to  the  appropriate  state  fish  and  wildlife  agency  for  review, comment,  and  coordination  as  specified  in  Attachment  3.    Installations  harboring  federally listed species should address ESA Section 7 consultation early in the INRMP preparation and review  process.    Identify  if  the  plan  submitted  for  review  covers  the  protection  and conservation of a federally listed  species.  The INRMP should  include an evaluation of the potential effects of INRMP implementation on listed species and their habitats, and indicate the  conservation  measures  that  are  employed  to  manage  those  effects.      If  a  Biological Opinion has been issued as a result of ESA Section 7 consultations, the INRMP becomes the document  by  which  the  AF  uses  to  describe  the  specific  programs  and  activities  that  are implemented to satisfy the required terms and conditions. 8.3.4.  EIAP Coordination.  The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Public Law 91–190),  Council  on  Environmental  Quality  implementing  regulations  at  40  C.F.R.  §§  1500-1508,  and  Air  Force  implementing  regulations  at  32  C.F.R.  Part  989  require  proponents  to fully consider possible impacts to federally listed threatened and endangered species early in the NEPA planning process (NEPA, §102(H)), including scoping. 8.3.4.1.  ESA  §7  requires  proponents  of  actions  that  may  affect  a  federally  listed threatened  and  endangered  species  or  its  habitat  to  consult  with  USFWS  and/or  NOAA Fisheries,  as  applicable.    Submit  draft  EIAP  documents  to  the  USFWS  and/or  NOAA Fisheries  for  review  and  comment.    Do  not  apply  an  Air  Force  CATEX  to  a  proposed action  (Appendix  B  to  Part  989,  Additional  Analysis  §A2.2.6)  unless  consultation  is complete and USFWS and/or NOAA Fisheries has concurred in writing that the action is not likely to adversely affect a federally listed threatened and endangered species. 8.3.4.2.  Include in the Final EA or EIS, all written correspondence with the USFWS or NOAA  Fisheries  documenting  the  completion  of  consultation  (NEPA,  §102(C)).  Forward copies of the final decision documents (e.g. Finding of No Significant Impact or Record  of  Decision)  to  the  USFWS  and  /  or  NOAA  Fisheries  when  federally  listed species are involved. (T-0). 8.4.  The  INRMP  as  a  Substitute  for  Critical  Habitat  Designation.  Pursuant  to  Section 4(a)(3)(B)(i)  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act  (16  U.S.C.    §1533(a)(3)(B)(i)),  the  Secretary  of Interior  “shall  not  designate  as  critical  habitat  any  lands  or  other  geographical  areas  owned  or AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 35 controlled  by  the  DoD,  or  designated  for  its  use,  that  are  subject  to  an  integrated  natural resources management plan prepared under section 101 of the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C.  § 670a), if the  Secretary  determines  in  writing  that  such  plan  provides  a  benefit  to  the  species  for  which critical habitat is proposed for designation.”  In accordance with 50 C.F.R. § 424, an INRMP is considered sufficient for critical habitat exemption if it meets the following criteria: 8.4.1.  The INRMP provides a conservation benefit to the species.  The cumulative benefits of the management activities identified in the INRMP, for the period covered by the INRMP, should  maintain  or  provide  for  an  increase  in  a  species’  population,  or  the  protection, maintenance, enhancement or restoration of its habitat within the area covered by the INRMP (i.e., those areas deemed essential to the conservation of the species).  A conservation benefit may  result  from  reducing  fragmentation  of  habitat,  maintaining  or  increasing  populations, insuring  against  catastrophic  events,  enhancing  and  restoring  habitats,  buffering  protected areas, or testing and implementing new conservation strategies.  Any restrictions on land use, whether  contained  in  an  INRMP  or  other  agreements,  should  be  temporary  to  allow flexibility in meeting future mission requirements, and must be approved by SAF/IE before the INRMP or agreement is signed. 8.4.2.  The  INRMP  provides  assurance  that  the  management  activities  necessary  to implement  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  plan  are  implemented.    Persons  charged  with INRMP  implementation  should  be  capable  of  accomplishing  the  objectives  of  the  INRMP, have  adequate  funding  to  implement  the  INRMP,  have  the  authority  to  implement  the INRMP, and have obtained all the necessary authorizations or approvals.  Installations must ensure  the  INRMP  provides  an  implementation  schedule  (including  projected  completion dates) to achieve the goals and objectives identified in the plan.  (T-2). 8.4.3.  The  INRMP  provides  assurance  that  the  conservation  effort  is  effective.    Use  the following criteria to determine if an INRMP provides an effective conservation effort: 8.4.3.1.  The INRMP includes biological goals (broad guiding principles for the program) and objectives (measurable targets for achieving the goals); 8.4.3.2.  The  INRMP  provides  quantifiable,  scientifically  valid  parameters that demonstrate  achievement  of  objectives,  and  standards  for  these  parameters  by  which progress is measured; 8.4.3.3.  The INRMP includes provisions for monitoring and, where appropriate, adaptive management; 8.4.3.4.  The  INRMP  includes  provisions  for  reporting  progress  on  implementation (based  on  compliance  with  the  implementation  schedule)  and  effectiveness  (based  on evaluation of quantifiable parameters) of the conservation effort. 8.5.  Exclusion  of  Critical  Habitat  Designation  Due  to  Economic  Impacts  or  National Security  Issues.  In  accordance  with  ESA  Section  4(b)(2)  (16  U.S.C.    §1533(b)(2)),  the Secretary  of  Interior  may  exclude  areas  owned  or  controlled  by  the  DoD  from  critical  habitat designation if the Secretary determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweighs the benefits of specifying the area as critical habitat; and that the exclusion of such area from critical habitat will  not  result  in  the  extinction  of  the  species  concerned.    In  order  to  support  the  ESA  4(b)(2) exclusion, the installation shall provide the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries with evidence of how a critical habitat designation would impact national security. (T-0). 36 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 9 FOREST MANAGEMENT 9.1.  Forest  Management  Practices  on  Air  Force  Lands.  The  principal  objective  of  forest management on AF installations is to maintain and enhance the ecological integrity of forested landscapes  while  supporting  the  military  mission.    Under  the  principles  of  ecosystem management  (see  2.8),  forest  treatments,  to  include  the  harvesting  of  forest  products,  may  be used  to  achieve  installation  goals  for  forest  enhancement  and  restoration,  wildlife  habitat improvement,  wildfire  protection,  recreational  development,  military  training  requirements, airfield safety compliance, and wood production. 9.1.1.  Commercial  Activities.    Commercial  harvesting  of  forest  products  on  AF  lands  is authorized,  provided  that  such  use  is  compatible  with  the  military  mission  and  consistent with the goals stated in the INRMP.  Never harvest forest products for short-term profit at the expense  of  long-term  sustainability  of  other  ecosystem  functions.    The  Range  Operating Agency will determine the availability of lands for commercial forestry activities on military training and testing ranges IAW AFI 13-212, Volume 1, Range Planning and Operations. 9.1.2.  Timber  Harvesting  Methods.    Use  appropriate  silvicultural  practices  to  maintain  the forest  ecosystem  in  a  healthy  condition  and  to  achieve  the  goals  stated  in  the  installation INRMP.    Ensure  the  INRMP  outlines  the  acceptable  timber  harvesting  practices  for  the installation  and  explains,  in  terms  of  current  and  desired  future  condition,  how  the  chosen management practices achieve the INRMP goals. 9.1.3.  Best Management Practices.  Implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) in forest management operations to minimize environmental impacts.  Utilize applicable state BMPs for forest management operations. 9.1.4.  Reforestation.    Conduct  reforestation  activities  as  detailed  in  the  INRMP.    The INRMP  should  state  the  acceptable  reforestation  practices  to  meet  the  stated  goals  and objectives and minimize soil disturbance and ecological impacts. 9.1.5.  Forest  Road  Construction  and  Maintenance.    Installations  with  a  commercial  forest resource must evaluate the existing network of forest access roads and trails in the INRMP. (T-3).    Forest  road  construction  and  management  should  be  consistent  with  the  ecosystem management  objectives  stated  in  the  INRMP.    Design  and  maintain  forest  access  roads  in accordance  with  applicable  state  BMPs.    Construct  new  single-purpose  forest  access  roads only  when  absolutely  necessary.    Close  temporary  roads  and  trails  constructed  solely  for timber harvesting operations to vehicular traffic after the timber removal is completed. 9.1.6.  Forest  Inventory.    Installations  with  commercial  forest  land  capable  of  producing more than 20 cubic feet/acre/year in wood biomass must maintain a forest inventory.  (T-3).  Update  forest  inventories  at  least  once  every  10  years.    Utilize  a  geographic  information system to record and access forest inventory data. 9.1.7.  Airfield Safety.  Installations with active airfields manage forest areas so that trees do not  pose  a  hazard  to  air  operations.    Refer  to  Uniform  Facilities  Criteria  (UFC)  3-260-01, Airfield  and  Heliport  Planning  and Design  for  specifications  on  airfield flight  surfaces  and safety zones. AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 37 9.2.  Forest  Product  Sale  Procedures.  Do  not  give  away,  abandon  or  destroy  forest  products with  marketable  value.    In  accordance  with  Financial  Management  Regulation,  7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 16, collect payment for all forest products with economic value that are removed  from  AF  lands.    Forest  products  may  not  be  traded  for  goods  or  services  nor  used  to offset  contract  costs  associated  with  construction,  land  clearing,  or  other  contracted  activity.  Lessees of government property may not remove or destroy commercial timber unless the forest products have specifically been conveyed in the lease and fair market value has been paid to the government.  Make an attempt to offer for sale any forest products that require removal prior to initiation  of  construction  or  other  land  clearing  operation.    Prior  to  any  land  clearing  or construction  activity,  contact  at  least  three  buyers  of  forest  products  within  the  region  to determine if they are willing to make an offer on the forest products requiring disposal.  These restrictions do not apply to materials determined to have no commercial value, as determined by the AFCEC/CZ Natural Resources SME or Forester employed by the federal government. Refer to 16.3.1.1 for guidance on forest product sale revenue collection. 9.2.1.  Small-Lot Sales.  Forest products with an appraised value at $25,000 or less may be sold  by  means  of  an  installation  small-lot  sales  permit.    Do  not  split  larger  timber  disposal sales  into  small  lots  to  avoid  formal  bids.    Installations  may  use  a  small-lot  sales  permit  to remove  timber  appraised  at  greater  than  $25,000  when  immediate  tree  removals  are necessary to clear timber downfall resulting from a natural disaster, or to meet airfield safety requirements  as  defined  by  an  impending  downgrade  of  airfield  operability  status.    Solicit informal  bids  from  at  least  three  potential  buyers.    Document  all  contacts  made  and  bids received,  including  contacts  that  respond  with  no  bid.    Upon  official  request  from  the installation,  the  AFCEC/CZ  Natural  Resources  SME  may  conduct  appraisals  and  small-lot sales on behalf of the installation. 9.2.2.  Large  Sales.    Dispose  of  forest  products  with  an  appraised  value  at  greater  than $25,000  by  contract  sale  utilizing  competitive  bidding  procedures  and  the  following guidelines. 9.2.2.1.  Sale  Preparation.   For  all  large  forest  product  sales,  prepare  contract specifications  that  describe  in  detail  the  forest  products  offered,  sale  areas,  allowable harvest methods and restricted activities.  Include maps or drawings of the gross sale area and  net  removal  area.    Ensure  a  professional  Forester  or  trained  Forest  Technician supervises  the  marking  and  harvest  of  forest  products  within  the  sale  area.    Prior  to removal of forest products, evaluate and document the effects of the proposed action in accordance with the EIAP process defined in 32 C.F.R. Part 989. 9.2.2.2.  Sale  Appraisal.  Obtain  an appraisal  of the  fair  market  value  of forest products offered  for  sale.    Do  not  sell  forest  products  for  less  than  their  appraised  value  without first preparing a written justification approved by a Contracting Officer.  Use regionally accepted standards  for scaling,  measuring, or  weighing  forest  products.   Mark appraisal documents  for  identified  sales  areas  with  "FOR  OFFICIAL  USE  ONLY,"  and  release appraisal documents only on a need-to-know basis. 9.2.2.3.  Sale Marketing.  For each forest product sale contract, prepare a solicitation for bid describing the forest products offered for sale and required harvesting specifications.  Solicit  bids  either  by  means  of  lump-sum  value  or  by  scaled  value  per  unit  volume  for 38 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 each  product  class.    Advertise  forest  products  for  sale  to  as  many  potential  buyers  as possible within the region specified by the servicing contracting office. 9.2.2.4.  Sale Contract Term.  Require removal of forest products within one year or less from the date of contract award unless a longer term is deemed to be in the best interest of  the  government.    For  sales  extending  longer  than  three  years,  include  a  rate predetermination  clause  to  reflect  changes  in  market  value.    Collect  security  deposits when appropriate to encourage buyers to honor payment and harvesting terms identified in the contract. 9.2.2.5.  Sale  Inspection.    Regularly  inspect  ongoing  forest  harvesting  activities.    The forest  products  buyer  is  responsible  for  executing  all  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the contract.    The  contracting  office  makes  a  determination  on  contract  completion  based upon  a  final  inspection  report  indicating  that  all  contractual  obligations  have  been  met.  Document  discrepancies  and  report  them  to  the  contracting  office.    Make  a  final inspection  at  the  conclusion  of  the  contract.    Allow  buyers  of  forest  products  the opportunity to repair any site damage in violation of contract terms prior to withholding security deposits. 9.2.3.  Protection of Sensitive Natural and Cultural Resources.  In  contracts for commercial harvesting  of  forest  products,  specify  safeguards  for  protection  of  sensitive  natural  and cultural resources.  Include clauses that identify penalties for damages incurred.  Also include clauses  that  identify  penalties  for  removal  or  damage  or  forest  products  not  designated  for disposal. (T-2). 9.3.  Procuring Forest Management Services 9.3.1.  Federal  Assistance.    The  United  States  Forest  Service  (USFS)  is  the  lead  federal agency  responsible  for  forest  management  in  the  United  States.    Under  the  authority  of  the Sikes Act, Air Force installations may enter into Interagency Agreements that provide for the transfer  of  funds  to  the  USFS  for  assistance  in  the  form  of  personnel,  agency  services,  or assistance  with  contracting  actions  that  implement  forest  management  practices,  including forest  product  sales.    Installations  may  access  the  services  of  the  USFS  by  means  of  an agreement  between  AFCEC  and  the  USFS  for  AF-wide  forest  management  support.    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under authority of the Economy Act, may also be used as a contracting  agent  for  the  disposal  of  forest  products  or  for  other  forest  management assistance  on  AF  lands.    For  installations  on  lands  withdrawn  from  the  public  domain,  the installation must confer with the Bureau of Land Management to determine the appropriate management and disposition of forest resources. (T-0). 9.3.2.  State  Assistance.    Under  the  authority  of  the  Sikes  Act  (16  U.S.C.  §670a-f), installations may enter into cooperative agreements with states to execute forest management activities  that  implement  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  INRMP.    Such  agreements  should provide a means by which the state is reimbursed for obligations incurred in support of the forest management practices authorized by that agreement. 9.3.3.  Service  Contracts.    Use  service  contracts  or  cooperative  agreements  for  forest management  support  when  federal,  state,  or  in-house  assistance  is  not  available.    Ensure  a professional  Forester  employed  by  the  government  reviews  all  service  contracts  that implement forest management practices. AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 39 9.4.  Financial  Management.  10  U.S.C.  §2665  authorizes  refunding  forest  management obligations with proceeds derived from the sale of forest products.  DoD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 16, Accounting for Production and Sale of Forest Products, lists the appropriate expenditures that can be reimbursed from forestry program funds.

Agriculture  Outgrant  Programs  on  Air  Force  Lands.  Air  Force  lands  may  be outgranted in the form of lease, license, or permit for agricultural purposes IAW AFI 32-9003, Granting  Temporary  Use  of  Air  Force  Real  Property,  and  the  additional  guidelines  contained herein. 10.1.1.  Compatibility  with  the  Military  Mission.    All  agricultural  outgrants  should  be compatible  with  the  military  mission  of  the  installation,  as  determined  by  the  Installation Commander.  The Range Operating Agency will determine the availability of outgrant lands on military training and testing ranges IAW guidelines in AFI 13-212. 10.1.2.  Compatibility with the INRMP.  Agricultural outgrants should be consistent with the goals and objectives of the installation INRMP.  Agricultural outgrants for crop production, livestock  grazing,  equestrian  operations,  commercial  seed  harvesting,  apiary  placement, maple sugar collection and any other agricultural product may be conducted where feasible and compatible with the INRMP.  The overriding principles of ecosystem management (see 2.8) also apply to any outgrant of AF lands for agricultural uses. 10.2.  Agricultural Outgrant Program Management. 10.2.1.  Administration.  The installation Real Estate Office and/or the Real Estate Division of  the  local  U.S  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  District  are  responsible  for  administrating agricultural  outgrants  on  AF  lands.    Natural  resources  managers  and  real  estate  personnel should collaborate in developing agricultural outgrant documents.  Outgrant renewal actions should  begin  at  least  nine  months  prior  to  expiration.    The  supporting  Air  Force  or  U.S. Army  Corps  of  Engineers  real  property  office  will  bill  outgrantees  in  accordance  with  the terms of the outgrant. (T-2) 10.2.2.  Outgrant  Instruments.    Agricultural  use  of  AF  property  requires  a  lease,  license,  or permit  prepared,  awarded,  and  executed  IAW  AFI  32-9003.    Ensure  all  agricultural  leases require the outgrantee to pay cash, provide services, and/or make improvements to the extent that the government is receiving a fair market value for use of the land.  Government-owned livestock  are  exempt  from  the  fee  collection  requirement.    Licenses  and  permits  for agricultural  uses  at  less  than  fair  market  value  are  not  allowed  unless  the  licensee  or permittee  is  eligible  for  an  exception  from  the  consideration  requirements  under  AFI  32-9003. 10.2.3.  Outgrant Revenue Collection.  Record revenues collected from agricultural outgrants on  a  DoD  Form  1131,  Cash  Collection  Voucher.    Deposit  proceeds  from  agricultural outgrants to Deposit Fund Account 57 F 3875.00AG 31FA 667100. 10.2.4.  Land  Use  Rules.    All  agriculture  outgrants,  to  include  grazing/cropland  leases, licenses, and permits, require written land use rules as requirements in the outgrant to ensure the  compatibility  of  outgrant  activities  with  the  military  mission  as  well  as  to  conserve  the soil,  water,  and  other  sensitive  natural  resources  within  the  areas  included  in  the  outgrant.  Installations  will  draft  land  use  rules  that  implement  the  appropriate  Best  Management Practices  for  erosion  and  sedimentation  control  as  established  by  the  USDA  Natural AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 41 Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and state guidelines.  (T-0).  Land use rules should also  be  written  to  support  the  natural  resources  management  goals  and  objectives  in  the INRMP.  Installations will develop a compliance checklist from the land use rules that can be used to perform objective inspections of outgrant operations to monitor compliance. (T-2). 10.2.5.  Technical Oversight.  Agricultural outgrant documents and their associated land use rules must be reviewed and approved by the designated installation or IST natural resources management  specialist,  installation  Flight  Safety  office,  and  Range  Operating  Agency,  as applicable.  (T-3). When practicable, seek technical assistance from an agricultural specialist from  the  NRCS,  USFS,  BLM,  state  cooperative  extension  service,  local  soil  and  water conservation  district,  or  other  agency  experienced  in  the  management  of  agricultural  and grazing lands. 10.2.6.  Compliance  Inspection.    The  installation  natural  resources  manager  and  supporting real  property  management  office  jointly  share  responsibility  for  outgrant  compliance inspection.    Schedule  inspections  of  agricultural  outgrant  operations  in  accordance  with guidelines  stated  in  AFI  32-9003.    A  qualified  agronomist,  livestock  grazing  specialist,  or natural  resources  management  specialist  inspects  outgrant  sites  semiannually  to  ensure  that the  outgrantee  complies  with  the  technical  terms  of  the  outgrant  and  associated  land  use rules.  Cooperating agency personnel can make semiannually on-site reviews of the outgrant program to assess crop and grazing land conditions and outgrant compliance on behalf of the AF.    The  inspector  completes  the  land  use  rules  compliance  checklist  at  each  review.    The installation  natural  resource  manager  will  ensure  all  inspection  reports  are  delivered  to  the administering real estate office for further action. (T-2). 10.2.7.  Improvements  and  Services.    Agricultural  outgrants  may  require  the  outgrantee  to provide agricultural land improvements, services and other in-kind consideration in lieu of a portion  or  all  of  the  cash  payment  due  the  United  States  Government  for  the  grant  of  the interest in the land.  The administering real property office calculates the fair market value of any such improvements and services and deducts the amount calculated from the cash rent or payment  due  the  United  States  Government.    Ensure  outgrant  instruments  provide  that  all such improvements become the property of the United States Government.  Installations with outgrants  that  allow  improvements,  services  and  other  in-kind  consideration  in  lieu  of  a portion or all of the cash payment must provide a justification for the substitution of in-kind consideration  for  the  cash  payment  in  the  INRMP.    (T-2).  The  INRMP  justification  should evaluate  the  impact  of  improvements,  services,  and  other  in-kind  consideration  to  the economic  sustainability  of  the  program,  to  the  military  mission,  and  to  the  achievement  of INRMP goals and objectives. 10.3.  Guidelines  for  Livestock  Grazing.  Installations  will  ensure  livestock  grazing  programs adhere to the following guidelines: (T-2). 10.3.1.  Livestock  grazing  programs  should  be  consistent  with  the  use  of  the  installation  to support military readiness. 10.3.2.  Livestock  grazing  programs  should  support  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the installation  INRMP.    Grazing  may  not  be  authorized  unless  such  use  is  documented  in  the INRMP as appropriate to achieve land management goals. 42 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 10.3.3.  Livestock  grazing  programs  may  not  degrade  the  natural  ecological  integrity  of  the landscape.    Do  not  allow  grazing  within  native  plant  communities  where  it  has  been determined that such use is inappropriate for the plant community type.  Suspend grazing on lands where historic overgrazing and other abusive grazing practices have limited the ability of the plant community to recover. 10.4.  Guidelines  for  Agricultural  Crop  Production.  Crop  production  programs  should support  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  installation  INRMP  and  Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft  Strike Hazard  Plan.    Installations  with  active  runways  must  coordinate  any  new  cropland  outgrant proposals with the installation Safety Office and Airfield Manager. (T-2). 10.5.  Monitoring  Outgrant  Lands  for  Compliance  with  the  INRMP.  Monitor  outgranted lands  to  ensure  that  land  use  is  in  compliance  with  the  applicable  land  use  rules  and  the  land stewardship  goals,  objectives,  and  implementing  guidelines  stated  in  the  INRMP.    Installations with  agricultural  outgrants  should  include  a  description  of  the  monitoring  program  in  the INRMP.  Installations will ensure monitoring programs adhere to the following guidelines:  (T-2). 10.5.1.  Monitor cropland outgrants annually, or when environmental conditions warrant, to ensure that they do not create unacceptable soil losses from erosion or cause point-source or non-point pollution to any natural water body.  Also monitor other direct and indirect impacts of agriculture outgrant activities on surrounding land and water resources. 10.5.2.  Monitor water runoff from cropland outgrants for levels of pesticides or fertilizer that exceed  state  regulatory  requirements.    Determine  the  location,  method  and  frequency  of water samples through consultation with the appropriate state agency. 10.5.3.  Monitor  livestock  grazing  outgrants  using  sample  plots,  photo  points,  permanent grazing  enclosures,  and  other  acceptable  means  to  evaluate  forage  condition,  trend,  and utilization, and determine if the overall health of the rangeland resources are being sustained.  Also note the presence and extent of invasive plant species (see Chapter 14). 10.6.  Pest Management on Outgranted Lands. 10.6.1.  Use of Pesticides by Outgrantee.  Ensure any application of pesticides on AF lands complies  with  AFI  32-1053,  Pest  Management  Program.    Ensure  outgrantees  performing pesticide  application  on  AF  lands  maintain  the  certification  requirements  of  the  state, territory, or host nation in which the installation lies.  Outgrant instruments require that the outgrantee obtain the approval of the installation pest management point of contact prior to any  pesticide  application,  and  report  all  actual  pesticide  usage  (in  pounds  of  active ingredient) to the pest management point of contact. 10.6.2.  Control  of  Noxious,  Exotic,  and  Invasive  Species.    Air  Force  agricultural  outgrant programs  must  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  Federal  Noxious  Weed  Act  7  U.S.C. 2801. Outgrant programs should, to the extent practicable and within the limits of available funds,  support  state  and  federal  programs  for  the  control  of  noxious,  exotic,  and  invasive plant  species.    Installations  may  enter  into  cooperative  agreements  with  local  area government  entities  that  establish  integrated  pest  management  principles  for  the  control  of undesirable  plant  species.    Expenditure  of  agricultural  program  funds  to  control  noxious, exotic and invasive species should be consistent with the level of effort exhibited on similar federal, state or private agriculture and grazing lands in the vicinity of the installation. AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 43 10.7.  Financial  Management.  10  U.S.C.    §2667  authorizes  the  use  of  revenues  from agricultural outgrants for agriculture program operating expenses as well as to support other AF natural  resources  program  initiatives.    Refer  to  Chapter  15  for  guidance  on  financial management procedures for AF Reimbursable Conservation Programs. 44 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 11 OUTDOOR RECREATION 11.1.  Outdoor  Recreation  Planning.  Ensure  the  installation  Integrated  Natural  Resources Management  Plan  addresses  outdoor  recreation  management.    Natural  resources  managers should  collaborate  with  the  installation  Community  Planner,  installation  Services  Directorate, and  other  stakeholders  in  the  planning  and  development  of  outdoor  recreation  on  an  AF installation;  and  with  the  Range  Operating  Agency  for  AF  ranges.    The  INRMP  identifies  the areas  on  the  installation  where  outdoor  recreation  activities  are  appropriate,  and  discusses  the compatibility  of  outdoor  recreation  programs  with  the  military  mission.    Natural  resource managers will ensure installation recreation areas are categorized in the INRMP as follows:  (T-1).  11.1.1.  Developed  recreation  areas  contain  facilities  designed  to  accommodate  intensive recreational  activities  such  as  sports fields,  campgrounds,  picnic  areas,  paved walking/jogging/cycling  trails,  winter  sports  areas,  marinas,  developed  swimming  beaches, and  other  outdoor  recreation  facilities  managed  by  the  Air  Force  Personnel  Center Directorate of Services. 11.1.2.  Dispersed recreation areas are areas that are suitable to support dispersed recreational activities  such  as  hunting,  fishing,  primitive  camping,  bird  watching,  boating,  hiking,  and sightseeing. 11.1.3.  Special  interest  areas  are  recreation  areas  that  contain  valuable  archeological, botanical,  ecological,  geological,  historic,  zoological,  scenic,  or  other  features  that  warrant special  protection  and  access  control.    Public  use,  to  include  interpretive  displays  and education programs, may be permitted as specified in the INRMP.  Collection of plants, plant material, animals, rock, soil, or fossils on Air Force property is prohibited, unless authorized in the installation INRMP. 11.2.  Public  Access  for  Outdoor  Recreation.  Ensure  all  developed  and  dispersed  outdoor recreation activities are consistent with the INRMP.  Allow use of outdoor recreation resources by  the  general  public  when  such  use  is  deemed  by  the  commander  to  be  compatible  with  the military mission and does not exceed the recreational carrying capacity of the land.  See 6.2.3 for guidelines  on  establishing  access  and  participant  criteria  in  the  INRMP.    The  INRMP  should address  the  specific  rules  and  procedures  for  outdoor  recreation  access  on  recreation  areas  that are not under the direct control of Air Force Services Directorate. 11.3.  Off-Road Vehicle (ORV) Use.  Ensure the INRMP includes installation policy on the use of  off-road  vehicles,  to  include  mountain  bikes.    Allow  use  of  off-road  vehicles  only  after thoroughly analyzing the impact of such use on soils, archeological sites, wildlife, water quality, and  other  ecosystem  attributes.    Periodically  monitor  and  evaluate  for  damage  any  areas designated  for  ORV  use.    Refer  to  Executive  Order  No.  11989,  Off-road  Vehicles  on  Public Lands, May 24, 1977, for federal policy on ORV use. 11.3.1.  Restrict  use  of  off-road  vehicles,  including  mountain  bikes  and  other  all  terrain vehicles, to areas that can sustain their use without damage to natural or cultural resources.  Require that all motorized off-road vehicles are licensed and insured. AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 45 11.3.2.  Close  areas  that  are  damaged  from  off-road  vehicle  use  to  prevent  further  damage.  Undertake rehabilitation projects to restore the damage. 11.4.  Watchable  Wildlife  Programs.  The  Air  Force  is  signatory  to  a  Memorandum  of Understanding  that  allows  for  cooperation  with  other  agencies  and  non-governmental organizations  to  develop  and  maintain  a  Watchable  Wildlife  Program  on  public  and  private lands.    The  purpose  of  the  program  is  to  increase  opportunities  for  people  to  observe  native wildlife in their natural habitats and to support wildlife habitat preservation.  When compatible with  the  installation  mission,  installations  may  designate  Watchable  Wildlife  Areas  in  the INRMP planning process.  If access by the general public is permissible, submit information on the Watchable Wildlife Area to Watchable Wildlife Incorporated for inclusion in publications. 46 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 12 LAND MANAGEMENT 12.1.  Land  Management  Programs.  Air  Force  land  management  activities  are  intended  to protect  and  enhance  desirable  natural  and  man-made  features  on  the  installation.    AF  land management  programs landscape  design,  grounds  maintenance,  urban  forest management, golf course maintenance, Bird/wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard reduction, irrigation and  water  management,  pest  management,  invasive  species  management,  control  of  non-point source pollution, and soil erosion control. include 12.2.  Grounds Maintenance Categories.  For purposes of designating the intensity of grounds maintenance,  ensure  the  INRMP  identifies  and  maps  installation  grounds  into  categories  of ‘improved’,  ‘semi-improved’,  and  ‘unimproved’  as  defined  in  Attachment  1.    The  INRMP should  describe  the  scope  of  grounds  maintenance  activities  that  planned  to  take  place  within each category. 12.3.  Designing  and  Maintaining  Landscapes.  Landscape  design  and  maintenance  activities should comply with the land management goals of the INRMP and the BASH Plan. 12.3.1.  Landscape Design.  To the maximum extent possible, utilize regionally native plants in  landscape  designs  for  improved  and  semi-improved  grounds.    Do  not  utilize  non-native species  that  tend  to  be  invasive  (reproduce  outside  the  intended  growing  area).    Design landscapes  that  reduce  maintenance  inputs  in  terms  of  energy,  water,  manpower,  and equipment.  Choose plant materials adapted to local environmental conditions that have the potential  to  reduce  the  need  for  irrigation,  fertilization  or  pesticides  to  maintain  a  healthy condition.  Do not establish or maintain vegetative species on or adjacent to the airfield that provide food, cover, roosting or nesting habitat to wildlife. 12.3.2.  Grounds  Maintenance.    Establish  grounds  maintenance  practices  according  to grounds maintenance category delineations.  Where practicable, convert improved grounds to semi-improved or unimproved grounds, and convert semi-improved grounds to unimproved grounds.  When feasible, convert landscapes dominated by non-native plants to native trees, shrubs, or grasses.  Irrigate installation grounds only when necessary to fulfill a justified user requirement. 12.4.  Golf Course Environmental Management (GEM).  The goals of a GEM program are to minimize  or  eliminate  potential  negative  impacts  to  the  environment  and  the  surrounding community, and ensure compliance with all appropriate environmental regulations.  Installations are  encouraged  to  develop  a  Golf  Course  Environmental  Management  Plan  (GEM  Plan)  as  a component plan associated with the INRMP.  Installations will ensure the GEM Plan addresses all environmental aspects related to golf course management, and provide the appropriate goals and objectives for managing the environmental aspects.  (T-3). 12.5.  Urban  Forestry.  Urban  Forest  Management.    The  INRMP  should  state  long-term  goals and  objectives  to  achieve  a  desired  future  condition  for  installation  landscape  trees  (i.e.  urban forest).    The  INRMP  should  include  a  list  of  recommended  landscape  trees  and  shrubs  that  is based upon site compatibility, life expectancy, maintenance requirements, and compatibility with BASH  safety  guidelines.    Replacement  plantings  should  favor  native  trees  and  shrubs  or  other species  that are  able  to  survive  with  minimal  maintenance  requirements.   Do  not  plant  trees  or AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 47 shrubs  that  require  irrigation  for  survival  beyond  an  initial  two-year  establishment  period.  Ensure  that  tree  plantings  do  not  create  a  future  hazard  for  aircraft  and  flight  operations.    An Urban Forest Management Plan may be developed as a component plan of the INRMP. 12.6.  Pest Management.  In accordance with AFI 32-1053, Pest Management Program, ensure the  installation  Integrated  Pest  Management  Plan  (IPMP)  addresses  all  strategies  for  managing pests.    Natural  resources  managers  will  coordinate  with  pest  management  personnel  to  ensure that the IPMP and INRMP are mutually supportive and not in conflict. (T-1). 12.7.  Non-point Source Pollution Prevention. 12.7.1.  Use  applicable  Best  Management  Practices  to  minimize  non-point  sources  of  water pollution.   To  determine  appropriate  BMPs,  consult  the  USDA  Natural  Resource Conservation  Service,  local  soil  and  water  conservation  district,  state  agricultural  extension office, or state water quality office. 12.7.2.  The  non-point  source  pollution  control  program  and  BMPs  for  specific  projects should be consistent with the state non-point source pollution management program as well as any enforceable requirements of the state Coastal Zone Management Programs. 12.7.3.  Before  using  treated  sewage  effluent  in  irrigation  systems,  coordinate  with  the  Air Force Civil Engineer Center to determine whether federal or state water quality requirements exist. 12.8.  Mineral Leasing.  The Bureau of Land Management is responsible for mineral leasing on federal  lands.    The  Air  Force  Civil  Engineer  Center,  Installations  Center  of  Excellence (AFCEC/ICE)  is  the  point  of  contact  for  coordination  on  all  proposed  mineral  exploration  and mining on land controlled by the AF, and for negotiation of reclamation requirements.  The Air Force  will  ensure  leases  include  provisions  for  it  to  be  reimbursed  for  any  damage  to  natural resources  or  removal  of  commercial  timber  resulting  from  oil  and  gas  leasing  and  mineral exploration and mining. 48 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 13 WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT 13.1.  Wildland  Fire  Management  Policy.  The  Review  and  Update  of  the  1995  Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy (January 2001) is the primary wildland fire policy document for federal agencies, and establishes the Guiding Principles, Policies and Implementation Actions for  wildland  fire  management  on  Department  of  Defense  lands.    The  National  Wildland  Fire Coordinating Group (NWCG) Wildland Fire Qualification Subsystem Guide (PMS 310-1/NFES 1414),  National  Fire  Protection  Association  (NFPA)  Standard  295  –  Standard  for  Wildfire Control, NFPA Standard 1051 – Standard for Wildland Firefighter Professional Qualifications, NFPA  Standard  1143  –  Standard  for  Wildland  Fire  Management,  and  NFPA  Standard  1144  – Standard  for  Protection  of  Life  and  Property  from  Wildfire  establish  the  accepted  professional standards  for  AF  wildland  fire  management  policy.    Installations  with  unimproved  lands  that present a wildfire hazard, and installations which utilize prescribed burns as a land management tool,  will  develop  and implement  a  Wildland  Fire  Management  Plan  (WRMP).    (T-0).    Ensure the  WFMP  is  incorporated  into,  and  consistent  with,  the  INRMP.    For  the  purposes  of  this instruction, the term “wildland fire” refers to both wildfire and prescribed fire. 13.2.  Program Authority. 13.2.1.  Air  Force Wildland Fire Center (AFWFC).  The  Air  Force Wildland  Fire Center is responsible  for  providing  oversight,  technical  direction  and  coordination  of  wildland  fire management planning and implementation for Air Force. 13.2.2.  The  Installation  Commander,  or  appropriate  designee,  approves  the  installation Wildland Fire Management Plan.  The WFMP designates a Wildland Fire Program Manager and  define  the  roles  and  responsibilities  for  wildland  fire  management  on  the  installation.  Prior  to  approval,  installations  must  submit  the  WFMP  for  review  and  comment  to  a qualified wildland fire expert having at least NWCG Type 4 Incident Commander (ICT4) or Type 2 Burn Boss (RXB2) qualifications as defined in PMS 310-1/NFES 1414. (T-1). 13.2.3.  The installation Wildland Fire Program Manager is responsible for the development, update,  and  implementation  of  the  WFMP.    The  Wildland  Fire  Program  Manager  may approve plans for prescribed burns if minimally qualified as a RXB2 Type 2 Burn Boss. 13.3.  Wildland  Fire  Management  Plan  Components.  The  purpose  of  the  installation Wildland  Fire  Management  Plan  is  to  reduce  wildfire  potential,  protect  and  enhance  valuable infrastructure and natural resources, and implement ecosystem management goals and objectives on  AF  managed  properties.    The  WFMP  should  directly  support  the  AF  mission  and  be consistent with installation emergency operations plans. As a minimum, installations will ensure the WFMP includes the following components:  (T-1).  13.3.1.  Goals  and  Objectives.    The  WFMP  establishes  the  goals  and  objectives  for  the wildland fire management program on the installation. 13.3.2.  Organizational  Structure.    The  WFMP  describes  the  wildland  fire  management organizational structure, and indicates its position within the installation command structure.  The  organizational  structure  for  wildland  fire  events  should  be  consistent  with  NWCG AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 49 Incident  Command  System  standards  in  order  to  accommodate  cooperation  and  integration with other federal and state wildland fire organizations across jurisdictional boundaries. 13.3.3.  Interagency Cooperation and Mutual Aid Agreements.  Installations are encouraged to  develop  regional  partnerships  for  wildland  fire  management  support  by  means  of reciprocal  agreements  with  other  federal,  state,  local  and  private  entities  to  share  human, logistical,  and  operational  resources.    Emergency  assistance  and  mutual  aid  agreements should conform to the guidelines stated in DoDI 6055.6 – DoD Fire and Emergency Services Program, and AFI 32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program.  Include  interagency  agreements  and  mutual  assistance  agreements  in  the  WFMP  as references or appendices. 13.3.4.  Smoke  Management  and  Air  Quality.    The  WFMP  should  describe  the  mission, environmental,  human  health  and  safety  factors  specific  to  the  installation  and  region  that affect  smoke  management  and  identify  necessary  mitigation  practices.    Refer  to  NWCG publication  PMS  420-2/NFES  1279  -  Prescribed  Fire  Smoke  Management  Guide  for guidance on factors to consider. 13.3.5.  Safety  and  Emergency  Operations.    The  WFMP  should  reflect  that  firefighter  and public  safety  is  the  first  priority  in  every  wildland  fire  management  activity.    The  WFMP identifies  installation-specific  safety  protocols  and  personal  protective  equipment  required for wildland fire operations.  NFPA 1977 – Standard on Protective Clothing and Equipment for Wildland Fire Fighting establishes the requirements for personal protection clothing and equipment. 13.3.6.  Risk Assessment/Decision Analysis Processes.  Sound operational risk management is  the  foundation  of  the  Wildland  Fire  Management  Plan.    Identify  the  indices  and/or  fire danger  rating  system  used  to  assess  wildfire  risk  and  potential  fire  behavior.    The  indices and/or  fire  danger  rating  system  should  adequately  describe  fire  hazard,  severity,  intensity, and  other  significant  factors  affecting  the  protection  of  life  and  property.    Identify  the environmental factors that are measured prior to ignition of a prescribed fire.  Identify normal and unique weather patterns that affect fire behavior on the installation. 13.3.7.  Wildland  Fire  History.    Include  in  the  WFMP  an  analysis  of  both  recent  and  long-term wildland fire history on the installation and in the region. 13.3.8.  Natural and Cultural Resources Considerations Checklist.  Provide a checklist in the WFMP  that  can  be  used  to  identify  sensitive  natural  and  cultural  resources  that  should  be given consideration before conducting any wildland fire management activity. 13.3.9.  Mission  Impact  Considerations.    Identify  the  potential  impacts  to  the  installation mission (positive and negative) that may occur as a result of implementation of the WFMP. 13.3.10.  Wildland Fuel Factors.  Identify the effects of installation fuel types and fuel loads on  fire  behavior.    Display  data  on  fuel  types  and  fuel  loading  by  maps  or  other  means.  Conduct fuel surveys to collect wildland fire fuels data if necessary. 13.3.11.  Monitoring  Requirements.    Identify  the  environmental  factors  that  are  monitored and  the  frequency  of  monitoring  required  for  both  a  wildfire  and  prescribed  fire.    Identify post-fire assessment protocols for both wildfires and prescribed fires. 50 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 13.3.12.  Public  Notification.    Identify  a  protocol  for  notifying  the  media  and  affected persons for wildfire incidents and prescribed burning activities. 13.3.13.  Funding  Requirements.

The WFMP identifies the  staffing  requirements,  according  to  specific  certification  and  training  requirements,  for the tasks associated with wildland fire management activities on the installation. 13.3.15.  EIAP for WFMP Implementation.  Actions proposed in a WFMP may constitute a major federal action as defined in 40 C.F.R. §1508.18 (b) (2).  Evaluate major federal actions for potential environmental effects IAW 32 C.F.R. Part 989. 13.4.  Wildland  Fire  Operations.  Air  Force  wildland  fire  policy  and  guidance  applies  to operations on undeveloped lands that does not involve facilities and infrastructure.  A wildland fire is any non-structure fire that occurs on wildland and includes both: (1) wildfires, to include unplanned natural fires (e.g. lightning), munitions caused fires, unauthorized human-caused fires, and  escaped  prescribed fire  projects,  and  all  other  unplanned  wildland  fires,  and (2)  prescribed fires  purposely  ignited  by  natural  resource  managers  to  meet  specific  land  management objectives.  A primary objective for any wildland fire operations is firefighter and public safety.  The Interagency Standards for Fire and Fire Aviation Operations (NFES 2724), may be used as a reference for wildland fire operations. 13.4.1.  Wildfire  Incident  Management.    Wildfires  occurring  on  AF  managed  lands  should have a response consistent with firefighter safety, known and potential hazards, and resource values  at  risk.    Acceptable  response  to  a  wildfire  incident  should  be  consistent  with  the direction specified in the installation Wildland Fire Management Plan, and may incorporate the  full  range  of  suppression  options  ranging  from  containment  and  monitoring  to  direct attack  and  full  suppression.   In  accordance  with  Homeland  Security  Presidential Directive/HSPD-5  –  Management  of  Domestic  Incidents,  February  28,  2003,  Air  Force wildfire  response  will  incorporate  the  National  Incident  Management  System  (NIMS) standards into the organizational structure to facilitate cooperation and integration with other federal and state wildland fire organizations across jurisdictional boundaries. (T-1). 13.4.2.  Prescribed Fire Operations.  Prescribed fire on Air Force installations can be used as a management tool to attain the goals and objectives of the INRMP and to support other AF mission requirements. 13.4.2.1.  Site-Specific Burn Plans.  Develop a site-specific burn plan for each prescribed burn conducted on AF property. The installation Wildland Fire Management Plan should identify the required components for site-specific burn plans.  At a minimum, burn plans include the following components: 13.4.2.1.1.  Burn objectives 13.4.2.1.2.  Prescription for acceptable weather and fuel moisture parameters 13.4.2.1.3.  Required personnel and equipment resources AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 51 13.4.2.1.4.

Burn  Plan  Approval.    Ensure  each  burn  plan  for a  prescribed  fire  is  approved and  signed  by  a  designated  authority  prior  to  ignition.    The  installation  Wildland  Fire Management Plan should designate the appropriate authority for burn plan approval, and identify the required coordination process for draft burn plans.  Installations may utilize qualified  personnel  from  the  Air  Force  Wildland  Fire  Center  to  review,  approve,  and execute an installation burn plan if qualified personnel are not present on the installation.  Installations  are  encouraged  to  seek  AFWFC  review  of  any  burn  plan  to  assure  that adequate safeguards are in place prior to burning. Burn plans for a prescribed fire in the controlled airfield area must be approved in advance by AFSEC/SEFW. (T-1). 13.4.3.  Use  of  Fire  Breaks.    When  planning  for  prescribed  fires,  and  when  suppressing wildfire,  utilize  natural  and  existing  man-made  features  whenever  possible.    Fire  breaks,  if required, should be constructed, maintained, or rehabilitated to prevent erosion. 13.5.  Wildland Fire Reporting. 13.5.1.  Wildfire  Reports.    As  soon  as  practical,  the  installation  Wildland  Fire  Program Manager reports to the Air Force Wildland Fire Center any wildfire incident that occurs on or threatens lands under Air Force jurisdiction.  At a minimum, post-fire reports include the fire name  (not  to  exceed  80  characters),  fire  location  (latitude  and  longitude),  total  area  of  fire, fire  injuries,  and  infrastructure  damage.    Provide  geospatial  data  on  fire  extent  if  available.  For uncontrolled wildfires lasting more than 24 hours, provide the AFWFC a daily report on the  potential  for  fire  growth,  current  and  expected  weather,  resource  values  at  risk,  multi-jurisdictional  agency  involvement,  and  information  on  additional  resources  needed.  Additionally, report wildfires greater in size than 100 acres in timber fuel types or 300 acres in grass fuel types to the local/state Interagency Coordination Center. 13.5.2.  Prescribed  Fire  Reporting.    Report  prescribed  fire  treatments  conducted  on  an installation to the AFWFC within 10 days of the event.  Minimum reporting requirements are treatment  name,  burn  location  (latitude  and  longitude),  and  total  area  treated.    Provide geospatial data on treatment area extent if available. 13.6.  Qualifications,  Certification,  Training,  Fitness  and  Medical  Surveillance  Standards for Wildland Fire Personnel. 52 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 13.6.1.

AF  personnel  who  participate  in  wildland  fire  activities  will  be  certified,  as  a minimum requirement, in Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation and Standard First Aid by the American Red Cross or comparable certification authority. (T-1). 13.6.1.4.  Ensure  position  descriptions  for  Air  Force  employees  that  are  expected  to participate  in  wildland  fire  activities  reflect  the  expected  level  of  involvement  and required certifications. Ensure position descriptions for civilian personnel with wildland fire management duties state if the position qualifies the position holder as a primary or secondary  wildland  firefighter,  as  described  in  Chapter  46  of  the  Office  of  Personnel Management  CRCS  and  FERS  Handbook  for  Personnel  and  Payroll  Offices.    Natural resources  management  personnel  not  classified  as  a  primary  or  secondary  wildland firefighter  may  perform  collateral  duty  in  wildland  fire  management  activities  as qualified.  13.6.2.  Wildland Fire Personnel Physical Fitness Standards. 13.6.2.1.  The  installation  WFMP  outlines  the  physical  fitness  standards  required  for personnel  that  participate  in  wildland  fire  management  activities  based  upon  their expected level of participation.  NWCG publications PMS 310-1/NFES 1414 – Wildland Fire  Qualification  Subsystem  Guide,  NFES  1596  –  Fitness  and  Work  Capacity,  and AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 53 NFES 2071 – Fit to Work, Fatigue and the Firefighter provide guidance for establishing physical fitness standards for various wildland fire management activities.   Work  Capacity  Test 13.6.2.2.  NWCG  Publication  PMS  307/NFES  1109  – Administrator's  Guide  is  the  AF  standard  for  assessing  fitness  for  personnel  that participate  in  wildland  fire  activities.      Utilize  the  Work  Capacity  Test  to  assess  three levels  of  fitness  for  personnel  involved  in  wildland  fire  activities:  (1)  Arduous,  (2) Moderate, and (3) Light. 13.6.2.2.1.  Personnel in the natural resources Job Series whose job descriptions state that  they  are  Primary  or  Secondary  Wildland  Firefighters  are  required  to  meet  the Arduous fitness criteria annually. (T-1). 13.6.2.2.2.  Air  Force  civilian  personnel,  contractors  and  volunteers  that  serve  as collateral duty wildland fire personnel, must meet the Moderate fitness test annually in order to perform wildland fire activities on AF managed lands.  (T-1). 13.6.3.  Medical  Surveillance  for  Wildland  Fire  Personnel.

Invasive  Species  Management  Policy.  Executive  Order  13112,  Invasive  Species, February  3,  1999  requires  all  federal  agencies  to  prevent  the  introduction  of  invasive  species, provide  for  their  control  and  minimize  their  economic,  ecological,  and  human  health  impacts.  Under Executive Order 13112, installations will, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, not authorize, fund, or carry out management actions that are likely to cause the introduction or spread of invasive species.  Furthermore, Title 7 U.S.C. §2814 requires that each federal agency establish and adequately fund an undesirable plants management  program through the  agency's budgetary process. 14.2.  Invasive  Species  Management  Program.  Address  invasive  species  management  in  the installation INRMP.  Formulate and implement INRMP goals and objectives to detect, respond to,  and  control  populations  of  invasive  species  in  a  cost-effective  and  environmentally  sound manner whenever and wherever practical.  INRMP goals should be consistent with the Federal Invasive  Species  Management  Plan  and  other  guidelines  promulgated  by  the  Federal  Invasive Species  Council.    The  invasive  species  management  element  of  the  INRMP  should  provide specific information on species to be controlled, recommended control methods, and appropriate level  of  control  effort  in  consideration  of  available  resources.    Promote  native  habitats  and  the restoration of native species in ecosystems that have been invaded. 14.3.  Invasive  Species  Detection  and  Monitoring.  The  INRMP  should  include  a  current assessment of the presence and extent of exotic and invasive species on the installation.  Conduct surveys  to  detect  and  map  invasive  species.    Monitor  invasive  species  populations  and  update inventory  information  as  new  species  are  discovered  and  known  populations  are  controlled  or eliminated. 14.4.  Invasive  Species  Control  on  Agricultural  Outgrants.  Cropland  and  grazing  outgrants on AF properties should include requirements for the outgrantee to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species.  Ensure outgrant agreements include requirements to implement and report control measures for invasive species that are identified in the INRMP. 14.5.  Control  of Feral Animals.  Installations may not, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, authorize, fund, or carry out activities that are likely to cause the introduction or spread of feral dogs, cats, pigs, goats or other non-native domesticated animals on AF-controlled lands. The  INRMP  should  address  the  specific  policies,  programs  and  methods  used  to  control  feral animals  on  AF  installations.    Feeding  or  harboring  of  feral  domesticated  species  is  prohibited unless justified in the INRMP as necessary to achieve a specified natural resources management objective. 14.6.  Interagency Cooperation.  Title 7 U.S.C.  §2814 authorizes cooperative agreements with state  agencies  for  the  control  of  undesirable  plant  species  on  federal  lands.    Partner  with  other federal,  state,  and  local  agencies  and  adjacent  landowners  in  joint  control  strategies  to collaborate efforts for the control of undesirable species and increase the effectiveness of control measures.    Installations  are  encouraged  to  participate  in  state  or  regional  Exotic  Pest  Plant Councils  and  Cooperative  Invasive  Species  Management  Areas  at  a  level  of  effort  that  is commensurate with efforts by the partners and within the legal authority of the AF. AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 55 Chapter 15 BIRD/WILDLIFE AIRCRAFT STRIKE HAZARD 15.1.  Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  (BASH)  Program.  The  focus  of  the  BASH program  is  to  prevent  wildlife-related  aircraft  mishaps  and  reduce  the  potential  for  wildlife hazards to aircraft operations.  Accomplishing this goal requires knowledgeable natural resources management on and adjacent to installation airfields.  Installation natural resources management activities  must  comply  with  the  requirements  of  AFI  91-202,  The  US  Air  Force  Mishap Prevention  Program,  AFI  91-204,  Safety  Investigations  and  Reports,  and  AFPAM  91-212, BASH Management Techniques.  AFCEC/CO and the Air Force Safety Center (AFSEC/SEFW) provide technical assistance to installations on BASH issues. 15.1.1.  The  installation  Integrated  Natural  Resources  Management  Plan  should  support  the BASH Plan.  The INRMP should address habitat management techniques that can reduce the potential for wildlife hazards to aircraft operations. Reference the BASH Plan in the INRMP.  A  BASH  Plan  designated  For  Official  Use  Only  (FOUO)  is  exempted  from  public  review, but is available to the USFWS and state wildlife agency upon request. 15.1.2.  Natural resources personnel will assist the installation flight safety office and others in the development and implementation of the BASH Plan.  Natural resource personnel will assist  the  flight  safety  office  in  providing  oversight  to  external  agencies  or  contractors involved in the implementation of the BASH program on Air Force property. (T-1). 15.1.3.  The  installation  natural  resources  manager  must  be  an  active  member  of  the installation Bird/wildlife Hazard Working Group (BHWG). (T-1). 15.1.4.  Installations  will  establish  procedures  for  coordination  and  review  of  construction and  infrastructure  improvement  projects  (e.g.  landscaping,  waste  water  treatment,  golf courses etc.) to ensure that any BASH related impacts are considered. (T-1). 15.2.  Natural  Resources  Management  in  the  Airfield  Environment.  Review  all  aspects  of installation  natural  resources  management  for  potential  wildlife  hazards  to  aircraft  operations.  Manage the land adjacent to aircraft operations areas to minimize attractions to wildlife.  Refer to Federal  Aviation  Administration  Advisory  Circular  50/5200-33B,  Hazardous  Wildlife Attractants on or Near Airports for guidance on identifying land uses near airfields that have the potential to attract hazardous wildlife. 15.2.1.  Airfield  Vegetation  Management.    Manage  vegetation  within  and  around  an  active airfield  to  satisfy  wildlife  abatement  objectives.    Promote  the  establishment  of  a  vegetative cover that reduces the attractiveness of the airfield to wildlife within a minimum distance of 500  feet  from  any  aircraft  movement  area  IAW  AFI  91-202  grass  height  requirements.  Vegetation  management  on  and  adjacent  to  the  managed  airfield  to  support  BASH  Plan objectives  is  a  military  readiness  activity  covered  under  50  C.F.R.  §21.15.    Additionally, avoid  using  landscape  plants  around  airfield  infrastructure  that  could  attracts  birds  or animals, and remove any landscape plants known to attract birds or wildlife in the vicinity of the airfield. 15.2.2.  Managing Wetlands in the Airfield Environment.  Wetland areas near an airfield may create  potential  hazards  to  aircraft  operations.    Innovative techniques  to  manage  wildlife  in 56 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 wetlands  should  be  explored  and  implemented.    Explore  and  pursue  legally  defensible actions  to  reduce  the  amount  of  wetlands  on  the  airfield  to  the  maximum  extent  possible when their presence conflicts with the flight mission.  While “no net loss” of wetlands is an important AF goal, give priority to flight safety. 15.2.3.  Airfield Drainage Ditches.  Manage drainage ditches to reduce their attractiveness to wildlife.    Do  not  locate  storm  water  runoff  retention  ponds  beneath  the  airfield  approach-departure  clearance  surfaces  as  defined  in  UFC  3-260-01.    Coordinate  with  the  appropriate regulatory authority to determine if maintenance of airfield drainage requires a permit IAW Section 404 of the CWA, or qualifies under a Corps of Engineers nationwide permit issued IAW Title 33, C.F.R. Part 330, Nationwide Permit Program. 15.2.4.  Landscaping.    Avoid  using  landscape  plant  material  that  could  attracts  birds  or animals  on  and  around  the  airfield.    Remove  any  landscape  plants  in  the  vicinity  of  the airfield that are known to attract birds or wildlife. 15.2.5.  Managing  Agricultural  Outgrants  in  the  Airfield  Environment.    Agricultural  and grazing  outgrants  (see  Chapter  10)  should  be  compatible  with  the  installation  BASH  plan and  INRMP.    Coordinate  proposals  for  outgrants  with  the  BHWG  to  ensure  that  the  crops grown and the agricultural methods used do not negatively impact flight safety. 15.2.5.1.  Agricultural  activities  are  not  permitted  within  an  aircraft  movement  area  or within the boundaries of the airfield security fence. 15.2.5.2.  Grain crops are highly attractive to wildlife and should never be grown near the airfield as part of an agricultural outgrant program. 15.2.5.3.  Grazing  animals  can  be  a  serious  hazard  if  uncontrolled  within  the  airfield.  Ensure strict livestock control and proper fencing. 15.3.  Management  of  Wildlife  in  Support  of  the  BASH  Plan.  The INRMP should  evaluate both existing and potential wildlife hazards to aircraft operations.  Although the Air Force Safety Center is responsible for the overall AF BASH program, natural resources and pest management personnel are an integral part of every installation BASH program.  Natural resources managers must share information on biological resources and habitat conditions with the installation safety office to facilitate the development of a comprehensive BASH program. (T-1). 15.3.1.  The  INRMP  should  identify  wildlife  species  that  may  pose  a  hazard  to  aircraft operations, mission readiness or capability, and discuss habitat management techniques that can  be  used  to  mitigate  the  threat.    Utilize  Air  Force  Safety  Center  and  Federal  Aviation Administration  data  on  wildlife-related  aircraft  mishaps  to  identify  those  species  that  are most  often  involved  in  aircraft  mishap  incidents.  Perform  local  wildlife  surveys  to  identify wildlife activity that may pose a risk to aircraft operations. 15.3.2.  Migratory  Birds.    Share  information  on  migratory bird  activity  with  flight  safety  in order  to  enhance  the  installation’s  BASH  program.    Coordinate  with  other  installations within the same flyway to obtain information on current migratory bird populations. Refer to 7.2. for guidance on activities that may affect migratory birds. 15.3.3.  Watchable Wildlife Programs.  Consider wildlife hazards to aircraft operations when developing any Watchable Wildlife programs.  Coordinate all Watchable Wildlife programs through the Bird/wildlife Hazard Working Group prior to implementation. AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 57   The 15.3.4.  Airfield  Wildlife  Damage  Control. installation  BASH  plan  details responsibilities for control of nuisance wildlife on the airfield.  Lethal control is authorized only  after  all  practical  non-lethal  control  measures  have  been  exhausted,  provided  that  the proposed actions are reviewed in EIAP procedures as stipulated in 32 C.F.R. Part989.  Obtain depredation  permits  from  the  USFWS  pursuant  to  the  Migratory  Bird  Treaty  Act  for intentional  takes  of  migratory  birds  in  support  of  the  BASH  program  (also  see  6.4).    The installation  BASH  Plan  designates  the  office  responsible  for  maintaining  all  applicable federal  and  state  depredation  permits  or  Migratory  Bird  Treaty  Act  permits  when  those permits are in support of the BASH program.  Ensure wildlife control methods specified in a BASH  plan,  as  well  as  the  permits  required,  are  referenced  in  the  installation  INRMP  and coordinated with the USFWS and state fish and wildlife agency as part of the annual INRMP review and update process (see 3.5).  If a federally protected species is present or suspected to  be  present  an  active  airfield,  notify  AFSEC/SEFW  to  identify  risks  to  flight  safety  and mission capability and to determine acceptable mitigative actions. 58 AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 16 NATURAL RESOURCES BUDGETING 16.1.  Funding  Sources.  This  chapter  outlines  the  appropriate  funding  sources,  funding priorities,  and  level  of  effort  for  AF  conservation  programs.    Funding  sources  include  the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) appropriation, reimbursable conservation program accounts for forestry, agriculture,  fish and wildlife and outdoor recreation management, the DoD Legacy Resource Management Program, and other sources such as those that may be obtained through grants or cooperative agreements executed under authority of the Sikes Act. 16.2.  Air Force Conservation Program Funding.  Conservation program requirements eligible for O&M funding are programmed as part of the Environmental Quality (EQ) Programming and Budget  process  as  described  in  AFI  32-7001,  Environmental  Management.    Program  natural resources  requirements  for  current  year  and  outyears  within  the  Automated  Civil  Engineer System  -  Project  Management  (ACES-PM)  system,  or  an  approved  successor  database.  Headquarters United States Air Force (USAF), Director of Air Force Civil Engineers (A4C) will annually  provide  additional  information  on  programming  and  budgeting  for  environmental quality  O&M  requirements  in  the  form  of  the  EQ  Programming  Matrix,  EQ  Standard  Titles Guidance,  and  EQ  Scoring  Model.    Use  the  EQ  Programming  Matrix  to  determine  if  the requirement  is  valid  or  not  valid  for  EQ  funding.    Categorize  conservation  requirements  as recurring  or  non-recurring,  and  designate  funding  priority  as  Level  0,  1,  2,  or  3  in  accordance with the guidance in AFI 32-7001.  16.2.1.  Level  0  Natural  Resources  Requirements  –  Maintain  Compliance  (Operations  and Services).  Level 0 includes recurring natural resources management requirements.  Ongoing natural  resources  management  activities  identified  in  an  approved  INRMP  are  Level  0 requirements  if  they  are  essential  for  the  successful  implementation  of  the  goals  and objectives  stated  in  the  plan.    Level  0  requirements  include  funding  for  personnel,  travel, training,  and  supply  costs,  as  well  as  recurring  inventories,  surveys,  sampling,  monitoring, reporting  and  record  keeping,  payments,  and  fees  required  by  a  specific  public  law  or compliance  agreement  (e.g.  Biological  Opinion  for  T&E  species  management).    Always utilize the EQ Standard Titles list for Level 0 project titles. 16.2.2.  Level  1  Requirements  –  Fix  Noncompliance.    A  Level  1  natural  resources requirement  is  a  non-recurring  action  needed  to  correct  a  non-conformance  or  out-of-compliance condition with a supported driver in the programmed year.  Valid drivers include federal  laws,  regulatory  mandates,  and  state  laws  applicable  to  federal  activities.    The principal  legal  drivers  for  natural  resources  requirements  are  the  Sikes  Act,  Endangered Species  Act,  Clean  Water  Act,  and  National  Environmental  Policy  Act.    Level  1  includes projects  that  implement  an  approved  INRMP  if  they  are  essential  for  the  successful implementation  of  the  goals  and  objectives  stated  in  the  plan,  to  include  requirements  to manage species and habitats to prevent the listing of a candidate species for listing under the auspices of the Endangered Species Act.  Natural resources surveys and mitigation measures (e.g. T&E species surveys, jurisdictional wetland delineations) required as a prerequisite for regulatory  approval  of  proposed  projects  must  be  funded  as  part  of  the  proponent’s  project cost  and  are  not  valid  Level  1  environmental  requirements.    Refer  to  the  EQ  Programming Matrix for additional guidance regarding supported and non-supported Level 1 requirements. AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 59 16.2.3.

Table 1: Preparation, coordination, and approval of an Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan on Air Force installations. STEP  ACTION  1 Notification – Intent to Prepare/Revise an INRMP.  Notify the USFWS Ecological Services Field Office,  USFWS Regional Office, local state fish and wildlife (F&W) agency office, office of the state F&W agency Director, and all appropriate internal and external stakeholders of the intent to prepare or revise an INRMP within 30 days of starting such an action.  Also notify the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) if the installation includes or is adjacent to marine environments.  Develop a time schedule for INRMP review and coordination by cooperating agencies and the public.  If formal consultation under Section 7 of the ESA is necessary, the time frames for that process applies. Preliminary Draft INRMP – Internal AF Review.  Distribute a Preliminary Draft INRMP for internal Air Force review and comment.  Air Force internal review includes a review by the installation chain of command and by the AFCEC Installation Support Team.  The Preliminary Draft INRMP includes the first iteration of goal and objective statements for the INRMP.   Preliminary Draft INRMP – External Agency Review.  After incorporation of internal AF review comments on the Preliminary Draft INRMP, send the Preliminary Draft INRMP with cover letter to the appropriate USFWS Ecological Services Field Office (and NOAA Fisheries when appropriate), and state fish and wildlife agency for review and comment.  In the cover letter, designate an installation point of contact, and request receipt of comments by a specified date (as determined in Step 1).  Send a copy of the forwarding cover letter to the appointed Sikes Act Coordinator at the USFWS Regional Office (and NOAA Fisheries Regional Office when appropriate), and state clearing house if available, to inform them that the review process has begun.  Ensure that copies of any external agency comments are distributed to all cooperating agencies.   Draft INRMP.  Prepare a Draft INRMP that incorporates accepted recommendations for improvement to the Preliminary Draft INRMP review.   Draft INRMP – Public Review.    New and revised INRMPs require that the public be given the opportunity of review and comment.  Simple annual updates do not require a public comment period.  In collaboration with the installation Public Affairs office, post a public notification when the draft INRMP is available for review and comment.  In the public notice, provide an address for public response, and allow the public a minimum of 30 days to provide comments.    2  3  4  5  94  6  7  8  9 10  AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 Final Draft INRMP.  Consider all comments received and incorporate them, as appropriate, into a Final Draft INRMP.  Submit the Final Draft INRMP concurrently to the local USFWS Ecological Services and to the USFWS Regional Office Sikes Act Coordinator.  Also send to the Director of the state fish and wildlife agency Regional Director of NOAA Fisheries when appropriate.  In the submittal letter, document the actions taken on comments received on previous drafts.  Request that the USFWS Regional Director and state agency Director provide consolidated written comments from all appropriate offices and divisions within 60 days of receipt of the final draft INRMP.   Final Coordination Comments.  The USFWS Regional Office (and NOAA Fisheries Regional Office when appropriate) and the Director of the state fish and wildlife office provides written comments on the Final Draft INRMP to the installation point of contact within the agreed upon timeline.     Final INRMP.  Consider all comments received from coordinating agencies and incorporate them into the Final INRMP as appropriate.  If no final comments are received from the USFWS, NOAA Fisheries, and state after a period of 120 days, the installation may request expedited review of its INRMP.  In such cases, the AFCEC Installation Support Team Office submits a written request for expedited review to the USFWS Regional Director (and NOAA Fisheries Regional Director when appropriate) and Director of the state fish and wildlife agency, with copy furnished to HQ USAF/A4CF.  HQ USAF/A4CF makes arrangements for representatives from these offices to meet within 30 days of receipt of such a request to resolve any outstanding coordination issues.   Signatures.  The Installation Commander, and the designated signatory authorities of the USFWS and state fish and wildlife agency sign the Final INRMP.  The Regional Director of NOAA Fisheries also signs the document when appropriate.   Publishing.  Make unclassified portions of the final INRMP available electronically via the internet or other similar means.  All draft and final INRMP documents should undergo appropriate security review prior to being made available to the public. AFI32-7064  18 NOVEMBER 2014 95 Attachment 4 ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT COORDINATION Figure A4.1.
