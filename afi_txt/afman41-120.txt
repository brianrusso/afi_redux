Overview.  This  instruction  establishes  general  guidance  and  procedures  for  Air  Force planning,  programming,  budgeting,  and  execution  of  the  Defense  Health  Program  (DHP) appropriation.    Resource  management  includes  the  process  of  determining  requirements, obtaining  resources,  and  effectively  and  efficiently  applying  those  resources  to  meet  the  Air Force's  direct  mission  and  support  responsibilities.  Resource  management  also  includes evaluation of internal controls, procedures, and protection of government assets. 1.2.  DoD  Medical  Mission.  The  medical  mission  of  the  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  is  to enhance DoD and our Nation’s security by providing health support for the full range of military operations and sustaining the health of the 9.7 million DoD health care beneficiary population. 1.3.  DHP History.  Prior to FY 1993, each of the Military Departments funded their respective healthcare operations from within their own appropriations.  Across the nation, and within DoD, healthcare  costs  were  escalating  rapidly.    Healthcare  costs  were  consuming  greater  portions  of the DoD budget.  In an effort to control the ever-increasing healthcare costs of the DoD, and to lend  greater  visibility  into  healthcare  expenditures,  Congress  directed  the  establishment  of  a unified DoD medical appropriation. 1.3.1.  On  December  14,  1991,  the  Deputy  Secretary  of  Defense  signed  Program  Budget Decision  (PBD)  742  to  consolidate all  medical  resources  under  the  control  of  the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, ASD (HA), and to make other required adjustments to the medical program.  The three military departments were directed to (1) parse out what they historically spent on medical care/ resources, and (2) transfer those amounts from their respective  Operations  and  Maintenance  (O&M),  Research,  Development,  Test,  and Evaluation (RDT&E), and Procurement appropriations into the new DHP appropriation. 1.3.2.  The  only  exceptions  to  the  merger  were  Military  Personnel  Appropriations  (MPA) resources in support of combat operations, field/numbered medical units, hospital ships, and ship-board  medical  operations;  and  Military  Construction  (MILCON)  funding  for  medical facilities.    MILCON  continues  to  be  reflected  in  the  Service  MILCON  account,  but  is administered  by  ASD(HA).    Combat  medical  support  continues  to  be  funded  via  Line funds/or  funds  appropriated  for  that  purpose  (i.e.  Other  Contingency  Operations  (OCO) appropriation). 1.4.  Military  Service  Re-organizations.  Each Service was given some leeway in determining how  much  to  transfer  to  the  DHP  and  how  it  would  restructure  itself  (organizationally)  to manage their respective DHP allocations. The Army and Navy established Medical Commands (MEDCOM  and  BUMED,  respectively).    For  the  Air  Force,  the  newly  established  DHP appropriation  did  not  drive  structural  organizational  changes;  AF  Military  Treatment  Facilities (MTFs)  would  continue  to  be  a  unit  on  the  base,  not  unlike  other  units  (CE,  Comm,  etc.),  it would simply be funded with the DHP appropriation. 1.5.  Funding  Distinctions.  In  establishing  MEDCOM  and  BUMED,  the  Army  and  Navy parsed  out  and  transferred  substantial  amounts  of  funding  to  the  DHP  for  Base  Support.    The transfer of Base Support enabled MEDCOM and BUMED to be self-supporting (not unlike other Major  Commands).    The  transfer  of  Army  and  Navy  Base  Support  to  the  DHP  included    10  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 resources for Base Support functions, such as Contracting and Legal Services.  Alternatively, the Air Force did not transfer Base Support to the DHP at all.  The Air Force maintained that Base Support would continue to be provided to its MTFs on a non-reimbursable basis as it had been prior to the establishment of the DHP.  The Air Force decided it would only transfer to the DHP the funds needed to operate the MTFs proper (e.g., within the walls of the MTF). 1.5.1.  The AFMS receives funds to pay for commodities consumed within the walls of Air Force  MTFs,  such  as  medical  supplies,  office  supplies,  medical  equipment,  basic  utilities (gas,  water,  electricity,  long-distance  telephone),  minor  construction/repair  the  MTF,  etc.  The Line of the Air Force (LAF) renders non-reimbursable common base support functions to the AFMS (e.g. Security, Fire, MPF, Legal, Vehicles, etc.).  This has not changed since the inception of the DHP.  In short, the Air Force transferred funds, not functions. 1.5.2.  The  AFMS  executes  the  DHP  through  direct  allotment  to  performing  installations/ activities for all DHP costs, except those retained by LAF when the DHP appropriation was initially established in FY93.  AF military medical personnel costs are paid centrally from the AF Military Personnel Appropriation, not the DHP. 1.6.  DHP  Appropriation  Legislation.  The  DHP  appropriation  account  was  established  via Title  10  United  States  Code  Section  1100  (10  USC  §1100)  for  the  purpose  of  carrying  out  the functions  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  with  respect  to  medical  and  health  care  programs  of  the DoD.  The Secretary of Defense may obligate or expend funds from the account for purposes of conducting  programs  and  activities  under  10  USC  Chapter  55,  Medical  And  Dental  Care, including  contracts  entered  into  under  section  10  USC  §1079,  §1086,  §1092,  or  §1097,  to  the extent amounts are available in the account. 1.7.  Beneficiaries  of  the  DHP  Appropriation.  The  purpose  of  10  USC  Chapter  55,  Medical and Dental Care, is established in 10 USC §1071, which states: “The purpose of this chapter is to create and maintain high morale in the uniformed services by providing an improved and uniform program of medical and dental care for members and certain former members of those services, and for their dependents.” 1.8.  TRICARE  Contracts.  TRICARE contracts for medical care for spouses and children are authorized  under  10  USC  §1079;  contracts  for  health  benefits  for  certain  members,  former members, and their dependents are authorized under 10 USC §1086; contracts for medical care for retirees, dependents, and survivors (alternative delivery of health care) are authorized under 10  USC  §1097.

Veterinary Services.  In addition to providing for worldwide medical and dental services to active  forces  and  other  eligible  beneficiaries,  the  DHP  appropriation  is  available  for  veterinary services  for  government-owned  animals  (support  for  pets  is  reimbursed  by  Non-Appropriated Funds). 1.10.  Other  DHP  Purposes.  The  DHP  appropriation  is  available  to  fund  medical  command headquarters  (except  for  HQ  AF  authorizations),  specialized  medical  training  of  medical personnel, and occupational and public health services.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   11  1.11.  DHP Budget Authority.  Appropriations represent legal authority granted by Congress to incur  obligations  and  to  make  disbursements  (payments/outlays)  for  the  purposes,  during  the time periods, and up to the amounts specified in the appropriation act. The purpose of the DHP appropriation  is  stated  in  10  USC  §1071,  which  provides  the  framework  for  obligations  and expenditures  of  DHP  funding.    The  applicable  Treasury  Account  Fund  Symbol  for  the  DHP  is 97*0130.  The DHP appropriation contains budget authority for: 1.11.1.  Operations and Maintenance (O&M).  DHP O&M funding (Fund Code (FC): 2X) is divided  into  seven  major  areas  known  as  Budget  Activity  Groups  (BAGs).    Funds distribution  in  the  Program  Budget  Allocation  System  (PBAS)  and  execution  of  the  DHP O&M appropriation is recorded in BAG level detail.  Realignment of funds between BAGs is generally  not  permitted,  although  AF/SGY  may  generally  provide  certain  exceptions.  Organizations/MTFs  must  maintain  BAG  funding  integrity  unless  authorized  otherwise  by AF/SGY.  (T-1). 1.11.2.  Research,  Development,  Test  and  Evaluation  (RDT&E).    DHP  RDT&E  (FC:  AC) funds  medical (IM/IT),  medical laboratory research, and the Armed Forces Radiobiological Research Institute (AFRRI). Information  Management/Information  Technology 1.11.3.  Procurement.    DHP  Procurement  (FC:  2F)  funds  the  acquisition  of  capital  medical equipment  and  equipment  for  initial  outfitting  of  newly  constructed,  expanded,  or modernized health care facilities; equipment for modernization and replacement of worn-out, obsolete,  or  uneconomically  reparable  items;  equipment  supporting  programs  such  as pollution control, clinical investigation, and occupational/ environmental health; and Military Health  System-specific  information  processing  requirements.    Equipment  purchased  with Procurement funds exceeds $250,000. 1.12.  Other  DHP  authorities:  Generally,  the  DHP  contains  budget  authority  for  the aforementioned O&M, RDT&E and Procurement appropriations; however, occasionally budget authority for special programs or Congressional Interest programs is also allocated and typically assigned a unique Fund Code. 1.13.  Medicare  Eligible  Retiree  Health  Care  Fund  (MERHCF).  Reference  Department  of Defense  Instruction  (DoDI)  6070.2,  Department  of  Defense  Medicare  Eligible  Retiree  Health Care  Fund  Operations.    The  DoD  MERHCF  is  an  accrual  fund  established  to  pay  for  DoD’s share  of  health  care  costs  for  Medicare-eligible  retirees,  retiree  family  members  and  survivors.  The  DoD  Office  of  the  Actuary  (OOA)  provides  annual  estimates  of  the  total  required  annual actuarial  normal  cost  contributions as  well  as  the  monthly  per-capita  normal  rates  for  full-time and  part-time  personnel  to  the  DoD  Comptroller,  the  Military  Departments,  DFAS,  and  the Defense Health Agency (DHA).  The MERHCF funds: 1.13.1.  Health  Care  Purchased  from  Non-DoD  Providers.    TRICARE  For  Life  (TFL-Non-Prescription  (Rx))  claims;  TRICARE  Senior  Pharmacy  (TSRx);  TRICARE  Mail  Order Pharmacy (TMOP); and the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan. 1.13.2.  Health  Care  Provided  in  MTFs.    The  DHA  issues  payments  from  the  MERHCF  to the  AFMS  for  healthcare  services  rendered  within  MTFs.    Those  payments  are  included  in the MTF’s O&M and are deemed prospective reimbursements. 1.13.2.1.  Prospective  payment  amounts  are  based  on  costs  reported  by  the  MTF’s Medical  Expense  and  Performance  Reporting  System  (MEPRS)  and  patient  encounter    12  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 data for the most recent fiscal year for which data is complete at the time the calculations are prepared.  The data is inflated to the year of execution using standard OMB inflation rates applicable to those years. 1.13.2.2.  MTF-specific rates are the average dollar cost per workload unit based on the most  recent  year  for  which  data  is  available  and  inflated  to  the  execution  year.    The prospective payment amount for inpatient care for eligible beneficiaries is the product of the  estimated  Relative  Weighted  Product  (RWP)  units  for  that  MTF  multiplied  by  the MTF-specific rate per RWP for the year of execution.  The prospective payment amount for  outpatient  care  is  the  product  of  the  estimated  Ambulatory  Procedure  Group  (APG) weight  for  that  MTF  multiplied  by  the  MTF-specific  APG  weight  for  the  year  of execution. 1.13.2.3.  MTF Outpatient Pharmacy.  Prospective payments are calculated based on two separate  cost  components:    (1)  “Ingredient  costs”  are  prices  for  pharmacy  ingredients purchased  from  vendors.    The  most  recent  completed  year  of  data  from  the  Pharmacy Data Transaction Service (PDTS) is used in the calculation.  (2) “Non-ingredient costs” are all other costs associated with MTF Outpatient  Pharmacy operations (civilian labor, supplies, etc.). These rates are based on MEPRS costs per prescription for the most recent fiscal year for which data is complete at the time the calculations are prepared, inflated to the year of execution.  Prospective payment amounts are the product of the MTF-specific non-ingredient rates multiplied by the estimated number of prescriptions to be  filled for that year.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   13  Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. 2.1.

(T-0).  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   17  Chapter 3 COMMODITIES NOT FUNDED WITH THE DHP APPROPRIATION 3.1.  Commodities Not Funded with the AF DHP Appropriation Allocation.  An expenditure that  may  be  reasonably  related  to  the  AF’s  allocation  of  the  DHP  may  not  be  paid  out  of  that appropriation where the expenditure falls specifically within the scope of another appropriation.  For  example,  when  the  DHP  appropriation  was  established,  the  Line  of  the  Air  Force  (LAF) parsed out from its existing appropriations, and programmatically transferred to the DHP, those monies  that  were  deemed  necessary  to  provide  healthcare  services.    However,  some  items  that would  appear  to  be  medically-related  were  retained  in  LAF  or  other  Department  of  Defense appropriations  because  the  costs  were  so  embedded  into  overall  operations  as  to  make  the discernment of those costs immaterial or impractical to parse out and transfer to the DHP.  Here are some examples (not all inclusive) of commodities not funded with the AF allocation of the DHP appropriation. 3.1.1.  Government  Vehicles.  LAF  appropriations  fund  ambulances  and  all  other  AF-owned/leased government vehicles used by medical personnel.  (T-0). 3.1.2.  Veterinary Clinics.  The Army provides the Air Force with the manpower to staff the Vet Clinics (i.e., Army Veterinarian, Army Veterinary Technicians).  In return, the Air Force provides  the  Vet  Clinic  with  space,  common  base  services,  logistical  support  services,  and maintenance, on a non-reimbursable basis.  In support of the Vet Clinic, the local AF MTF (DHP  appropriation)  provides  medical  supplies/pharmaceuticals,  medical  equipment  and medical  equipment  maintenance,  Sustainment,  Restoration  and  Maintenance  (SRM),  and utilities  for  the  Vet  Clinic.    Non-appropriated  Funds  (NAF)  reimburse  the  supporting  MTF for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies used for pets.  (T-0). 3.1.2.1.  Custodial Support for Veterinary Clinics.  Air Force Joint Instruction (AFJI) 48-131, Veterinary  Health  Services,  Chapter  6-1,  states  "Veterinary  Health  Program  costs  for  all operating  budget  requirements  in  support  of  DoD-owned  animals,  to  include  unit  mascots, will  be  included  in  the  DHP  operating  budget.  These  requirements  include  costs  for  items such  as  equipment,  operational  temporary  duty,  vehicle  maintenance,  fuel  costs,  facilities, and  communications  necessary  to  provide  the  appropriate  medical  care."    The  term "facilities"  in  this  paragraph  does  not  just  refer  to  Sustainment,  Restoration  and Modernization, but is intended to include utilities and custodial services (in support of DoD-owned  animals).    Further,  as  stated  in  DoDI  6400.04E  paragraph  3(c),  it  is  DoD  policy  to "integrate installation  veterinary public and animal health  services with installation medical services, including support from the installation commander (ex. Wg/CC) and senior medical commander  (ex.  MDG/CC)  for  common  services,  supply, logistics,  facilities  and communication."  Each base will need to assess individually what level of custodial service is required for support to DoD-owned animals (ex. working dogs).  In most cases, the majority of  patients  treated  at  Vet  Clinics  are  non-DoD  animals  (pets).    At  those  veterinary  clinics where  both  working  animals  and  pets  are  treated  the  cost  of  custodial  services  should  be proportionately shared with LAF, based upon any incremental custodial requirements beyond those required for support by the DoD-owned animals.  (T-1).    18  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 3.1.3.  Base Support.  In parsing out the funds to transfer to the DHP, the AF did not transfer funds  for  certain  Base  Support  activities,  opting  instead  to  retain  funds  and  continue providing these services to  the AFMS on a non-reimbursable basis.  Base Support includes manpower authorizations, support equipment, necessary facilities and the associated costs of installation:  Comptroller  services;  Automated  Data  Processing  services;  Information Activities;  Legal  Activities;  Civilian  Personnel  Administration;  Military  Personnel Administration;    Printing  and  Reproduction;  Safety;  Management  Analysis/Management Engineering; Retail Supply Operations; Supply Activities; Procurement Operations; Storage Activities;  Maintenance  of  Vehicles;  Transportation  Activities;  Training  (excludes  troop training  and  tactical  exercises);  Physical  Security  and  Police  Activities;  Laundry  and  Dry Cleaning  (for  troop  support  and  other  appropriated  fund  activities);  Bachelor  Housing Operations and Furnishings (management, housing assignment, care of quarters, provisions, care,  preservation  and  maintenance  of  furnishing,  etc.);  Food  Service;  Social  Actions; Community  Services;  Chaplains;  Family  Housing;  Retail  and  Troop  issue;  Commissary Operations; Morale, Welfare and Recreation; and Real Property services.  (T-0). 3.1.4.  Drug  Demand  Reduction  (DDR).    The  DDR  program  is  funded  by  appropriations specifically for DoD counternarcotic programs (non-DHP).  The appropriation is managed by the  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Counternarcotics  (DASD/CN).    Funds  are issued by the DoD Comptroller to LAF via a central transfer account.  Funds are executed in PE 88789F.  Refer to AFI 44-120, Military Drug Demand Reduction Program, and AFI 44-107, Air Force Civilian Drug Demand Reduction Program, for more information.  (T-0). 3.1.5.  Alcohol  and  Drug  Abuse  Prevention  and  Treatment  (ADAPT)  Program.    Ensures ADAPT Program receives adequate funding to support counseling, treatment, prevention and outreach efforts. Non-clinical prevention, education and aftercare are not funded with DHP, rather resources are provided via Program Element (PE) 88723 funds (i.e., ―line funding) to support  these  programs.    Refer  to  AFI  44-121,  Alcohol  and  Drug  Abuse  Prevention  and Treatment (ADAPT) Program.  (T-0). 3.1.6.  Family  Advocacy  Program  (FAP).    The  AF  FAP  provides  a  continuum  of  services designed  to  build  community  health  and  resiliency.  AF  FAP  uses  specific  Defense-wide O&M  (non-DHP)  allocated  for  family  maltreatment  prevention  and  intervention  to  provide civilian  staffing  for  FAP.    The  staff  may  be  hired  through  the  civil  service  or  contract, dependent upon available authorizations and funding.  Funds for the FAP are issued by the DoD Comptroller to the LAF for distribution to installations.  FAP funding is executed in PE 88718F.  Refer to AFI 40-301, Family Advocacy, for more information.  (T-0). 3.1.7.  Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC).  Funds (non-DHP) for the SARC are provided by LAF.  (T-0). 3.1.8.  Medical War Reserve Materiel (WRM).  Maintenance, repair and sustainment support for  WRM  assets  are  funded  through  a  centrally-funded  Line  of  the  Air  Force  program  (PE 28038F).      DHP  funding  may  not  be  used  to  support  the  AFMS  WRM  program.    The  Air Force  Working  Capital  Fund/Medical  Dental  Division  (AFWCF/MDD)  funds  WRM materiel.  Guidance on management of Working Capital funds and assets is outlined in AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics Support, and DOD FMR 7000.14R Vol. 11B and Vol.4.  (T-0). 3.1.8.1.  WRM  Programming  and  Execution.    The  AFMS  WRM  program  resources  are centrally programmed by the AF/SG3X Program Element Monitor (PEM).  Execution of  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   19  the  program  is  decentralized  and  is  coordinated  through  the  AFMS  WRM  Integrated Process  Team  made  up  of  members  from  AFMOA/SGALX  as  the  lead  with  voting members  from  the  Manpower  &  Equipment  Force  Packaging  (MEFPAK)  responsible agencies, AF/SG3XP and the AF/SG3X PEM.  The WRM IPT will convene annually in July  of  the  fiscal  year  preceding  the  execution  year  to  develop  the  execution  year Spend/Production Plan.  Adjustments to Future Year modernization and execution plans adjustments  will  be  identified  for  input  into  the  Annual  WRM  Portfolio  Management Workgroup meeting for development of the AF/SG Prioritized POM Position (PPP). 3.1.8.2.  Unfunded  Requirements.    During  the  execution  year,  if  an  MRA  requires additional funding as a result of new or changing requirements, the issue will be brought up  at  the  quarterly  WRM  In-Process  Reviews  (IPRs).    These  IPRs  will  be  held  in December,  March,  and  June  and  as  required.    The  purpose  of  the  IPR  is  to  provide  an update on the progress of execution of the approved Spend/Production Plan and provide the MRAs an opportunity to request execution year deviations. 3.1.9.  Medical  Counter-Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological  and  Nuclear  (MC-CBRN) Program.    The  MC-CBRN  program  is  a  centrally-funded  line  program  using  Program Element  28036F  (PE  58036F  for  ANG).    The  MC-CBRN  Program  resources  are  centrally programmed  by  AF/SG3X  Program  Element  Monitor  (PEM)  but  executed  by  the MAJCOMs.    The  Medical  Readiness  Panel  addresses  overall  program  funding  status  and execution update.  (T-1). 3.1.9.1.  The PEM has overall financial management of program.  (T-1). 3.1.9.2.  MAJCOM SGX’s have overall responsibility for managing the budget execution of  PE  28036F  funds  for  the  installations  within  their  respective  command.    HQ ACC/SGX is the MC-CBRN Lead.  (T-1). 3.1.9.3.  The MTF RMO provides financial management analysis support to the Medical Readiness  Officer  to  include  but  not  limited  to  liaison  support  between  Base  Level/FM and MAJCOM/FM.  (T-1). 3.1.9.4.  Unfunded  Requirements.    If  an  installation  requires  additional  funding,  the MAJCOM will first determine if funds can be reprogrammed within the command.  If the MAJCOM  is  unable  to  fund  the  requirement  out  of  existing  funds,  the  MAJCOM/SGX will coordinate with ACC/SGXH as the program execution lead.  After ACC/SGXH has determined that a disconnect exists, they will coordinate with AF/SG3X to find a funding solution.  However, unfunded requirements will not be considered if the MAJCOM is not meeting its execution rate target. 3.1.10.  Air Shows.  The cost for both medical supplies and non-medical supplies needed for the aid stations is an Air Show expense (not a DHP expense).  Some requested supplies are medical  (i.e.,  bandages,  gauze,  etc.),  but  others  such  as  sunscreen  and  lip  balm  aren't.  Medical supplies can be procured by medical logistics (establish a PFMR to charge Services for the items needed).  Any excess materials remaining after the Air Show should be turned over to Services.  (T-0).    20  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 4 MEDICAL PLANNING AND PROGRAMMING 4.1.  Overview.  The  Planning,  Programming,  Budgeting  and  Execution  (PPBE)  system  is  the DoD  resource  management  process  with  four  interrelated  functions  consistent  with  national security  objectives,  policies  and  strategies.    This  system  identifies  capability  requirements (Planning),  matches  them  with  resource  requirements  (Programming),  translates  them  into budget  proposals  (Budgeting)  and  evaluates  spending  (Execution)  to  determine  how  well  the desired capabilities are achieved. 4.2.  The AFMS POM.  The purpose of the AFMS POM is to resource medical requirements in support  of the warfighter across  the domains of  air,  space and cyberspace while  meeting  DoD, Chief of Staff of the AF (CSAF), and AF/SG priorities. 4.3.  The  Medical  Planning  and  Programming  Guidance  (MPPG).  The MPPG produces an optimum long-range plan within viable resources and provides guidance for development of the POM.  The MPPG provides guidance to support the production of detailed planning products by MAJCOMs, AFMOA and key functional organizations. 4.3.1.  The MPPG is constructed to be flexible and adapt to the inevitable program changes and  requirements  that  occur  during  a  POM  cycle.  The  MPPG  document  serves  as  formal guidance  for  the  AFMS  POM.    The  MPPG  can  be  adjusted  throughout  the  POM  cycle  as more definitive guidance from the LAF or ASD(HA) is received. 4.3.2.  The  MPPG  can  be  downloaded  from  the  AFMS  Knowledge  Exchange  website,  or contact AFMOA/SGAR for assistance. 4.4.  General Roles and Responsibilities within the AFMS POM Construct. 4.4.1.  The  MTFs  identify  emerging  issues  within  their  facility,  based  on  mission,  into capability requirements.  The MTF leadership works directly with their MAJCOM functional and AFMOA analysts. 4.4.2.  The  MAJCOMs  translate  emerging  issues  in  their  area  of  responsibility,  based  on mission,  into  capability  requirements.    The  MAJCOMs  vet  and  review  issues  from  their MTFs  prior  to  forwarding  them  to  AFMOA.    The  MAJCOM  works  closely  with  AFMOA, Consultants/Career  Field  Managers,  Panels  and  AF/SG  Staff  to  integrate  priorities  and requirements in the POM.  MAJCOMS also serve as advisors to the AFMS Group on issues unique to their MAJCOM. 4.4.3.  AFMOA serves as the first level of entry for Program Change Transactions (PCT) into the  corporate  process.    AFMOA  provides  subject  matter  expertise  in  consolidating, synchronizing,  and  integrating  MAJCOM  requirements  with  AF/SG  guidance.    AFMOA conducts  enterprise-wide  analysis  of  requirements  in  order  to  shape  MAJCOM  positions.  AFMOA provides the AFMS-wide view on operations to the AFMS Corporate Structure. 4.4.4.  AF/SGY provides input during the POM build to ensure seamless program execution, advise  the  AFMS  Corporate  Structure  on  fact-of-life  changes,  and  ensure  an  executable program.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   21  4.4.5.  AF/SG8P  serves  as  the  focal  point  for  AFMS  POM  integration  and  is  the  AFMS Corporate Structure process manager.  They link planning, programming and execution to the AF/SG strategic vision.  AF/SG8P also develops a resource roadmap and advises the AFMS Corporate Structure on the development of the program. 4.4.6.  AF/SG8E  (the  Cost  Analysis  and  Program  Evaluation  Division)  performs  unbiased analysis  to  help  the  AF/SG  solve  complex  issues  related  to  peacetime  healthcare  and readiness  operations.    They  provide  evidence-based  courses  of  action  to  support  AF/SG strategic imperatives in the planning, programming and execution processes.  AF/SG8E also seeks  to  eliminate  variance  across  the  AFMS  and  institute  standardized  analysis methodologies and protocols. 4.4.7.  AFMSA/SG8F  (Health  Facilities  Office)  provides  input  during  the  POM  build  for Initial  Outfitting  and  Transition  (IO&T)  requirements  which  are  driven  by  the  MILCON program as well as a portion of the Restoration & Modernization (RM) program.  SG8F also validates the financial requirements for Sustainment which are generated by the DoD Facility Sustainment  Model  (FSM),  as  well  as  financial  requirements  driven  by  a  facility recapitalization model and other factors including Facility Condition Index scores (AKA:  Q-Ratings), operational mission changes, and other identified needs. 4.4.8.  The AFMS Panels are the AFMS centers of expertise for their program areas.  Each panel is chaired by an AF, AFMOA, or AFMSA Colonel or GS equivalent.  Membership is recommended by the chairperson and approved by the AFMS Group.  Membership generally includes  applicable  Air  Staff  functional  representatives,  consultants,  career  field  managers, program Offices of Primary Responsibility, and others as required.  They are the initial point of entry to the corporate structure for issues that require corporate review. The AFMS Panels provide  the  first  level  of  corporate  vetting  of  new  initiatives,  disconnects,  and  offsets,  and they  support  the  AF  and  SG  vision  and  resource  allocation  processes.    They  review  and develop options for presentation to the AFMS Group.  The AFMS Panels support the entire spectrum  of  PPBE  activities  and  draft  AFMS  recommendations  for  USAF-funded requirements for AFMS Corporate Structure review. 4.4.9.  The  AFMS  Group  is  the  first  level  of  the  AFMS  Corporate  Structure  that  integrates the  AFMS  mission  and  capabilities  into  a  balanced  program.    The  Deputy  AF/SGY  or AF/SG8  chairs  the  Group,  SG  Deputy  Directors  are  voting  members,  and  non-voting members  include  MAJCOM  SG  representatives,  senior  enlisted  representative,  corps directors, AF/SG3 (Medical Operations Directorate) subdivisions, panel chairs, and Program Element  Managers  (PEMs).    They  provide  corporate  oversight  and  direction  to  the  AFMS Panels consistent with AF/SG strategic direction and provide recommendations to the AFMS Council.    The  AFMS  Group  deconflicts  AFMOA/MAJCOM/Panel  positions,  integrates policy, allocates  resources, executes key AFMS initiatives  and programs, and applies fiscal restraint across the Corporate Structure.  It provides a fiscally balanced, prioritized program, plus top unfunded initiatives and potential trade-space to the AFMS Council for their review and referral to the AF/SG for approval. 4.4.10.  The  AFMS  Council  provides  cross-functional,  senior  level  review  of  resource allocation and strategic AFMS issues with ultimate responsibility to make recommendations to  the  SG.  The  Deputy  SG  chairs  the  Council,  SG  Directors  are  voting  members,  and  non-voting  advisors  include  the  MAJCOM  SGs,  Chief  Medical  Enlisted  Force,  AFMS  Group    22  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 voting  members,  corps  chiefs,  and  the  senior  civilian  representative.    The  AFMS  Council reviews  AFMS  Group  proposals  and  forwards  recommendations  to  the  AF/SG  for  final approval. 4.4.11.  The AF/SG is the final approval authority of AFMS POM issues to include planning and programming guidance and instruction, and the allocation of programmed manpower and total obligation authority. 4.5.  POM Build Process. 4.5.1.  The  MPPT  is  a web-based  application that  serves  as  the  official  database  for  AFMS manpower and DHP O&M resources.  It automates and standardizes the processes involving the identification, revision, review, approval, and formal submission of medical resources as part of developing the POM and President’s Budget (PB). 4.5.2.  The MPPT also provides the ability for organizations to review, modify, and confirm changes  to  the  baseline  programs.    These  changes  go  down  to  Functional  Account  Codes (FAC) or Cost Center (CC) level for Manpower and Finance, respectively. 4.6.  Financial Plans (FinPlan). 4.6.1.  The  starting  point  for  the  financial  planning  process  is  the  current  fiscal  year  MPPT closing file prepared by AF/SG8P.  The MPPT is turned over to AF/SGY for use in preparing the  AFMS  Execution  Year  Financial  Plan.    Each  MAJCOM  Financial  Plan  (FinPlan)  file includes  all  known  Program  Budget  Decisions  (PBDs)  or  Resource  Management  Decision (RMD) adjustments, AFMS Corporate Bills, and MAJCOM identified adjustments. 4.6.2.  FinPlans are prepared by all activities administering DHP funds.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   23  Chapter 5 MEDICAL CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES AND PAY 5.1.  Overview.  RMOs  perform  analyses  for  Medical  Planning  and  Programming  Guidance (MPPG),  collect  personnel  utilization  data,  prepare  requests  for  changes  to  manpower requirements  and  authorizations,  and  participate  in  the  review  and  validation  of  manpower requirements. 5.2.  Manpower Responsibilities. 5.2.1.  RMOs  ensure  personnel  are  assigned  to  work  centers  and  position  authorization numbers  based  on  the  Unit  Manpower  Document  (UMD).    Changes  to  manpower authorizations are processed via an Authorization Change Request (ACR). 5.2.2.  RMOs  must  coordinate  with  the  Personnel  and  Administration  Flight  to  ensure personnel assigned to the MTF are placed against correct position numbers and Organization Structure Codes (OSC) on the Unit Personnel Management Roster (UPMR).  (T-1). 5.3.  Civilian  Pay  Responsibilities.  RMO  monitor  civilian  manpower  authorizations  and personnel actions to determine the financial impact of expected gains and losses. 5.3.1.  Civilian  pay  funding  is  a  fenced  program  and  funding  cannot  support  other requirements without expressed permission from AF/SGY. 5.3.2.  RMO  should  take  immediate  action  to  correct  any  civilian  personnel  AFSC discrepancies.    Generally,  MTF  employees  funded  with  DHP  appropriations  bear  medical AFSCs. 5.3.3.  Leave  and Overtime.  Ensure compliance with  AFI 36-815, Absence and Leave, and AFI 36-802, Pay Setting (governs overtime). 5.3.3.1.  Per  AFI  36-815,  paragraph  1.2.2.,  the  organization  commander  must  establish appropriate  internal  administrative  procedures  for  requesting  and  receiving  approval  of leave, and specify those supervisory levels authorized to approve leave.  (T-1). 5.3.3.1.1.  Supervisors  or  Team  Leaders  Authorized  to  Approve  Leave:    Ensure  that all employees under their supervision are informed of the procedure they must follow in requesting and using leave. 5.3.3.1.2.  Use the Automated Time Attendance and Production System (ATAAPS) to document time and attendance (T&A), including absences, leave, and overtime work requests.    ATAAPS  provides  an  automated,  single-source  input  for  reporting  and collecting T&A and labor data and for passing that information to interfacing payroll and accounting systems. 5.3.3.1.3.  RMO must maintain official copies of the commander’s leave policy, and copies  of  the  DD  Form  577,  Appointment/Termination  Record  –  Authorized Signature, for all supervisors/team leaders authorized to approve leave.  (T-1). 5.3.3.2.  In the absence of ATAAPS or other AF-approved electronic T&A system, T&A must be recorded on appropriate Office of Personnel Management (OPM) forms, such as the  OPM  71,  Request  for  Leave  or  Approved  Absence,  or  for  overtime—the  AF  Form    24  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 428,  Request  for  Overtime,  Holiday  Premium  Pay,  and  Compensatory  Time).    Note:  Employees must obtain approval from their overtime authorizing official before ordering overtime  (EXCEPTION:  In  an  emergency,  the  supervisor  may  order  overtime  without authorization but must document the overtime no later than the following workday).  (T-1). 5.4.  Civilian  Pay  Monitoring  Tools.  The  RMO  must  continuously  monitor  civilian  pay transactions to ascertain that the MTF is not paying for employees that are no longer assigned to the  organization,  while  simultaneously  verifying  that  the  MTF  is  properly  paying  for  those employees that are assigned to DHP-funded authorizations.  At a minimum, on a quarterly basis, the RMO will select a sample of civpay transactions from the previous quarter, and ensure that all transactions are properly reflected in the Commander’s Resource Integration System (CRIS) Civilian Pay module.  (T-1). 5.4.1.  Tools to monitor civilian pay transactions include the Civilian Manpower and Funding Report  (AR  1092  report),  the  MTF’s  MPPT  file,  UMD,  and  CRIS  Civ  Pay  Module.  Verification of civilian pay transactions via the CRIS Civilian Pay Module includes thorough review of transactions to ensure: 5.4.1.1.  All  civilian  personnel  are  paid  from  the  correct  Responsibility  Center/Cost Center (RCCC), and Program Element Code (PEC), per the UMD. 5.4.1.2.  No payments were made to civilian employees not assigned to the organization during the pay period being reviewed. 5.4.1.3.  The PECPIF and PECPERS match exactly. 5.5.  Civilian Personnel Leave Policy.  All leave must be documented per AFI 36-815.  AFMS organizations must: 5.5.1.  Verify civilian leave requests are approved by an authorized person (timekeepers and approving officials are appointed in writing).  (T-0) 5.5.2.  Verify the civilian’s supervisor reviews and certifies timesheets.  (T-0) 5.5.3.  Verify hours on timesheets match hours recorded in the CRIS civpay module.  (T-0) 5.5.4.  Verify  Overtime  hours  are  approved  by  an  authorized  official  before  the  overtime hours are worked.  (T-1) 5.5.5.  Verify  that  the  PEC  of  the  position  to  which  the  employee  is  assigned    is  the  same PEC from which the person is paid.  (T-0) 5.5.6.  Verify that gross pay correct by comparing the  PCR SF50s to the R60 Report.  (T-0) 5.5.7.  Verify that the unit has a process to ensure the Line of Accounting on the AF 3821 for newly assigned employees is completed by RMO.  (T-0) 5.6.  Civilian  Vacancies.  Organizations/MTFs  shall  endeavor  to  fill  all  civilian  UMD authorizations before hiring other types of positions. 5.7.  Civilian  Overhires.  Overhires  must  be  sourced  within  the  organization’s  budget  and should only be hired into term/temp positions.  (T-1).  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   25  5.8.  New  Hires.  Complete  an  AF  Form  3821  for  all  newly  assigned  civil  service  employees.  RMO completes Section C of the form and submits it to the servicing Civilian Personnel Office.  RMO  validates  the  UMD  position  number,  line  of  accounting,  and  ensures  the  organization’s Civilian Pay monitor receives a copy of the completed AF Form 3821.  (T-1). 5.9.  Non-DHP  Civilians.  DHP  is  not  used  to  fund  Base  Support  functions  such  as  chaplains, contracting officers, attorneys, Security Police, Military Personnel Flight, and other base support functions.  Those  functions  are  provided  to  medical  organizations  on  a  non-reimbursable  basis.  Funding for those operations were not included in the AF transfer of appropriations to the DHP when the DHP was established.  The AFMS does not have authority to fund LAF functions with DHP. 5.9.1.  Medical Law Consultants (MLC) are not funded with DHP funds.  MLCs are Active Duty personnel, therefore, they are funded with the MPA, not with DHP funds. 5.9.2.  All  legal  support,  including  paralegal  support,  is  managed  by  The  Judge  Advocate General (AF/JA).  Base-level legal support to the MTF is part of Base Support and provided on  a  non-reimbursable  basis.    Manpower  for  legal  support  is  funded  with  either  MPA  (for military), AF O&M (for most civilians), or DHP (for select MLC civilian paralegals).  If an MLC  requires  additional  paralegal  support  due  to  workload  demands,  a  request  for  the authorization  should  be  submitted  to  AF/JA.    If  the  requirement  is  validated,  AF/JA  and AF/SG will coordinate to determine the correct funding source. 5.9.3.  Chaplain support falls within the umbrella of Base Support and is managed by the AF Chaplain. Manpower is funded with either MPA (for military) or AF O&M (civ pay). 5.9.4.  Contracting Officers (CO) fall within the umbrella of Base Support and are managed by  SAF/AQ.  Manpower  is  funded  with  either  MPA  (for  military)  or  AF  O&M  (civ  pay).  MTFs  often  have  civilian  Medical  Equipment  Management  Officers  (typically  within  the Medical Logistics Flight) whose primary job  role/responsibilities including the oversight  of the  MTF’s  contracts.   These  positions  may  be  classified  within  the  110X-series (Contracting), but hold medical logistics AFSCs. 5.10.  Incentives  &  Bonuses.  Unless  special  authority  exists  to  the  contrary,  funding  of  all incentives and bonuses for DHP-funded civilian authorizations come from the existing medical civilian pay budget.    26  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 6 WORKLOAD REPORTING AND DATA QUALITY 6.1.  Data  Quality  (DQ).  Per  DoD  Instruction  6040.40,  Military  Health  System  Data  Quality Management  Control  Procedures,  the  quality  of  MHS  data  is  critical  to  the  effectiveness  of MHS-wide  optimization  programs,  performance-based  management,  TRICARE  contracts, resource  allocation,  decision-making  at  all  levels,  and  many  other  operations  and  management activities  across  the  system.    Each  MTF  shall  submit  complete,  accurate,  and  timely  data  in compliance with DoD and MHS data collection and reporting requirements.  (T-1). 6.1.1.  Data Quality Manager (DQM).  The DQM is the focal point for all DQ-related issues at the MTF.  The MTF Commander must appoint a primary and alternate DQM.  (T-1).  The DQM advocates for senior leadership support, adequate resources, and trains MTF personnel.  The  DQM  works  closely  with  the  Data  Quality  Assurance  Team  (DQAT)  and  Executive Committee  to  ensure  compliance  with  DQ  objectives  and  requirements.    DQM  duties include: 6.1.1.1.  As prescribed by DoDI 6040.40, the DQM at the MTF shares responsibility with colleagues  from  resource  and  information  management  and  patient  administration  to complete  the  monthly  Data  Quality  Management  Control  (DQMC)  Review  List  (DoDI 6040.40,  Enclosure  1).    Once  the  list  is  completed,  the  DQM  briefs  the  results  to  the MTF's Executive Committee. 6.1.1.2.  The  DQM  prepares  the  Monthly  Data  Quality  Commander’s  Statement  (DoDI 6040.40, Enclosure 2), obtains the commander’s approval and signature, and forwards the signed statement to the Air Force Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA) DQ Office by the last duty day of each month. 6.1.1.2.1.  A  DQ  statement  is  mandated  for  all  fixed  military  MTFs.    Complete, accurate, and timely data is critical to AFMS leadership decision making at all levels.  It  affects  program  effectiveness  and  efficiency,  performance-based  management, contracts,  resource  allocation,  facility  sizing  and  many  other  operations  and management activities. 6.1.1.2.2.  Limited  Scope  MTFs  (LSMTFs)  and  AF  Aid  Stations  are  not  required  to perform a monthly DQMC Review List or DQ Statement. 6.1.1.3.

Ensure  all  identified  discrepancies  are  corrected  and  data  retransmitted  as necessary. 6.1.3.  CHCS Provider File.  Proper management of the CHCS Provider file is paramount to data integrity.  Errors in the CHCS Provider file can result in lost revenue, inaccurate capture of  workload,  lack  of  data  integrity,  and  patient  safety  issues.    The  DQAT  assigns responsibility for maintenance of the CHCS Provider file. 6.1.3.1.  Comprehensive training materials are available on the AFMOA DQ Knowledge Exchange website, https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx2/DataQuality/Pages/home.aspx. 6.1.3.2.  Following these general CHCS Provider file instructions will reduce errors: 6.1.3.2.1.  Provider Name is  a required field  in the CHCS  Provider file and must  be entered in the following manner:  (LASTNAME,FIRSTNAME MI). 6.1.3.2.2.

The National Provider Identifier (NPI) is a 10-digit numeric code that is unique to each provider and is required for all CHCS flagged providers. 6.1.3.4.  The  Provider  Class  and  corresponding  Signature  Class  fields  are  required  for every provider in the CHCS Provider file.  These fields work in tandem and are a direct link for clinical and ancillary order entry. 6.1.3.5.  The Provider Specialty Code (PSC) is used to record specialties associated with a  provider.    The  PSC  field  is  a  3-digit  identifier  that  maps  to  Provider  Taxonomy  and CMAC Provider Class. 6.1.3.6.  The Taxonomy code is a 9-digit identifier that classifies health care providers by area of specialization and is directly related to PSC. 6.1.3.7.  The  Primary  Hospital  Location  designates  the  requesting  location  for  orders entered either by, or on behalf of, the provider.  The location for a provider should be the clinic where he/she normally works and must have a valid MEPRS code associated with the location. 6.1.3.8.  The  Drug  Enforcement  Agency  (DEA)  number  is  a  unique  identifier  that  is assigned  to  a  health  care  provider  allowing  them  to  write  prescriptions.    If  the  DEA  is unavailable, the License number must be completed.  If neither is available, the provider SSN should be used. 6.1.4.  Recommendations for Out-Processing Internal Providers.  When providers depart, the MTF  can  lose  workload  and  be  placed  at  risk  for  insufficient  medical  information  and documentation if the following minimum actions are not completed prior to departure. 6.1.4.1.  Providers  must AHLTA/CHCS/ERSA/Inpatient Encounters. sign  all  outstanding  orders  and  complete/sign  all 6.1.4.2.

The  RMO ensures that  funds are used  only for authorized  purposes;  funds are economically and efficiently used; and obligations and expenditures do not exceed the amounts authorized.    Funds  control  and  compliance  with  Title  31  United  States  Code  (USC)  and  other statutory  and  regulatory  (OMB,  DoD,  and  Air  Force)  requirements  which  govern  the  use  of appropriated funds or other funds is imperative for financial improvement and audit readiness. 7.2.  Responsibility  of  Air  Force  Members  and  Employees.  The  actual  obligation  of government  funds  must  be  authorized  or  made  by  government  employees  or  military  members with  the  specific  authority  to  do  so.  Contracting  out  the  responsibility  for  the  control  or obligation of government funds is prohibited since, under the law, a contractor or its employees cannot be held responsible for violations of Subsections 1341(a) or 1517(a) or Section 1342 of Title 31 USC, only military members and employees of the government can be held responsible for  such  violations  and  answerable  to  the  administrative  and  criminal  sanctions  of  the Antideficiency Act (ADA).  (T-0). 7.2.1.  Standards  of  Ethical  Conduct  for  Employees  of  the  Executive  Branch.    AFMS personnel must embody the principles set forth in Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)  Part  2635.101,  and  the  DoD  5500.7-R,  Joint  Ethics  Regulation.    (T-0).    Each employee  has  a  responsibility  to  the  United  States  Government  and  its  citizens  to  place loyalty  to  the  Constitution,  laws  and  ethical  principles  above  private  gain.  To  ensure  that every citizen can have complete confidence in the integrity of the Federal Government, each employee  shall  respect  and  adhere  to  the  principles  of  ethical  conduct  set  forth  in  5  CFR 2635.101,  as  well  as  the  implementing  standards  contained  in  that  part  and  in  pertinent supplemental agency regulations.  Principles:  (T-0). 7.2.1.1.  Public  service  is  a  public  trust,  requiring  employees  to  place  loyalty  to  the Constitution, the laws and ethical principles above private gain. 7.2.1.2.  Employees shall not hold financial interests that conflict with the conscientious performance of duty. transactions  using  nonpublic 7.2.1.3.  Employees  shall  not  engage Government  information  or  allow  the  improper  use  of  such  information  to  further  any private interest. in  financial 7.2.1.4.  An employee shall not, except as permitted by subpart B of 5 CFR §2635, solicit or  accept  any  gift  or  other  item  of  monetary  value  from  any  person  or  entity  seeking official  action  from,  doing  business  with,  or  conducting  activities  regulated  by  the employee’s agency, or whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee’s duties. 7.2.1.5.  Employees shall put forth honest effort in the performance of their duties. 7.2.1.6.  Employees shall not knowingly make unauthorized commitments or promises of any kind purporting to bind the Government. 7.2.1.7.  Employees shall not use public office for private gain.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   31  7.2.1.8.  Employees shall act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual. 7.2.1.9.  Employees  shall  protect  and  conserve  Federal  property  and  shall  not  use  it  for other than authorized activities. 7.2.1.10.  Employees  shall  not  engage  in  outside  employment  or  activities,  including seeking or negotiating for employment, that conflict with official Government duties and responsibilities. 7.2.1.11.  Employees  shall  disclose  fraud,  waste,  abuse,  and  corruption  to  appropriate authorities. 7.2.1.12.  Employees shall satisfy in good faith their obligations as citizens, including all just  financial  obligations,  especially  those—such  as  Federal,  State,  or  local  taxes—that are imposed by law. 7.2.1.13.  Employees  shall  adhere  to  all  laws  and  regulations  that  provide  equal opportunity for all Americans regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap. 7.2.1.14.  Employees  shall  endeavor  to  avoid  any  actions  creating  the  appearance  that they are violating the law or the ethical standards set forth in this part. Whether particular circumstances  create  an  appearance  that  the  law  or  these  standards  have  been  violated shall  be  determined  from  the  perspective  of  a  reasonable  person  with  knowledge  of  the relevant facts. 7.2.2.  The local Staff Judge Advocate’s office should be consulted with questions pertaining to ethics or ethical behavior. 7.3.  Lifecycle  of  Appropriations.  Appropriations  provide  the  statutory  authority  to  incur obligations and to make payments out of the Treasury for specified purposes. 7.4.  New Obligations.  Obligations must be incurred within the time that the appropriation was made available for new obligations.  (T-0).  Generally, the appropriation lifecycles (to incur new obligations) are as depicted at Table 7.1 below. Table 7.1.  Appropriation Lifecycles.  Type of Funding Authority O&M RDT&E Procurement  Lifecycle Description O&M is a 1-year (annual) account RDT&E is a 2-year (multi-year) account Procurement is a 3-year (multi-year) New obligations may only be incurred during the FY for which the appropriation is made.  New obligations may be incurred for a period not to exceed 2 years from the FY in which the appropriation is made.  New obligations may be incurred for period not to exceed 3 years from the FY in which the appropriation is made.    32  MILCON No-Year  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 account   MILCON is a 5-year (multi-year) account This account is available for an indefinite period New obligations may be incurred for period not to exceed 5 years from the FY in which the appropriation is made.  New obligations may be incurred until the objective has been accomplished, or all of the funds in the account have been expended. 7.5.  Appropriation  Status.  Appropriations  may  be  classified  as  current  (or  unexpired), expired,  or  cancelled.    Refer  to  Table  7.2  for  a  definition  of  each  of  the  appropriation classifications. Table 7.2.  Appropriation Classification Status.  Classification Status Current (Unexpired) Accounts Expired Accounts Canceled Accounts  Description The account is available for “new” obligations, and to adjust and/or liquidate those obligations.    Example:  FY13 O&M appropriations may be obligated between 1 Oct 2012 thru 30 Sep 2013.  The appropriation is “current” during that time period.  After the period of availability to incur new obligations has passed, the appropriation is said to be “expired.”  New obligations can no longer be made against appropriations that are expired.  The expired appropriation remains available for a period of 5 years for recording, adjusting and liquidating obligations properly chargeable to that FY account (31 U.S.C. 1552(a)).  Example:  FY13 O&M appropriations may be obligated between 1 Oct 2012 thru 30 Sep 2013.  On 1 Oct 2013, that FY13 O&M appropriation is now considered “expired”.  New obligations cannot be made against that FY13 appropriations; however, obligations that were made while the appropriation was “current” can still be liquidated (payments made), and the obligation can still be adjusted (such as deobligating funds no longer needed).  On September 30th of the 5th fiscal year after the period of availability for obligation of an appropriation account ends, the account is said to be “canceled,” and any remaining balance (whether obligated or unobligated) in the account is no longer available for obligation or expenditure for any purpose. 7.6.  The Concept of Availability to Incur New Obligations.  There are three elements related to  the  concept  of  availability—purpose,  time,  and  amount.  All  three  must  be  observed  for  the  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   33  obligation  or  expenditure  to  be  legal.  Whether  appropriated  funds  are  legally  available  for something depends on three things: 7.6.1.  Purpose.  The purpose of the obligation must be one for which the appropriation was made.  (T-0).  To illustrate, the purpose of the DHP is governed by 10 USC Chap 55, which must be read in harmony with the historical programming of medical expenditures within the Air Force as explained in Chapter 1.  Generally, the purpose parameters for the expenditure of  the  Air  Force  allocation  of  the  DHP  appropriation  can  be  discerned  by  reviewing  that information.  When there is a question as to whether a DHP expenditure  is appropriate, the matter must be reviewed by AF/SGY. 7.6.2.  Time.  An obligation must be incurred within the time that the appropriation was made available for new obligations.  (T-0). 7.6.3.  Amount.  An obligation may not exceed the amount appropriated by statute, nor may it be incurred before the appropriation becomes law, unless otherwise provided by law.  (T-0). 7.7.  Necessary  Expense  Rule.  Determining  whether  use  of  DHP  funds  is  proper  can  be difficult at times.  To facilitate the determination, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) provides the “Necessary Expense” rule, wherein an expenditure can be justified after meeting a three-part test: 7.7.1.  The  expenditure  must  bear  a  logical  relationship  to  the  appropriation  sought  to  be charged.  In other words, it must make a direct contribution to carrying out either a specific appropriation or an authorized agency function for which more general appropriations are available.  (T-0). 7.7.1.1.  This test is the one that generates by far the lion’s share of questions. On the one hand, the rule does not require that a given expenditure be “necessary” in the strict sense that the objective of the appropriation could not possibly be fulfilled without it. Thus, the expenditure does not have to be the only way to accomplish a given objective, nor does it have to reflect the best way to do it. Yet on the other hand, it has to be more than merely desirable or even important. 7.7.1.2.  An expenditure cannot be justified merely because someone  thinks it is a  good idea, nor can it be justified simply because it is a practice engaged in by private business, or  because  BUMED  or  MEDCOM  do  it  (remember,  they  are  structured  differently  and received  base  support-  funding  from  their  Line  counterparts  when  the  DHP  was established). 7.7.1.3.  The important thing is not the significance of the proposed expenditure itself or its value to the government or to some social purpose in abstract terms, but the extent to which  it  will  contribute  to  accomplishing  the  purposes  of  the  appropriation  the  agency wishes to charge. If a proposed use of funds is inconsistent with the statutory language, the expenditure is improper, even if it would result in substantial savings or other benefits to the government. 7.7.2.  The  expenditure  must  not  be  prohibited by  law.  The  second  test  under  the  necessary expense  doctrine  is  that  the  expenditure  must  not  be  prohibited  by  law.  As  a  general    34  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 proposition,  neither  a  necessary  expense  rationale  nor  the  “necessary  expense”  language  in an appropriation act can be used to overcome a statutory prohibition. 7.7.3.  The expenditure must not be otherwise provided for, that is, it must not be an item that falls  within  the  scope  of  some  other  appropriation  or  statutory  funding  scheme.    The  third test expresses that, generally, an expenditure cannot be authorized within one appropriation if it  is  otherwise  provided  for  under  a  more  specific  appropriation  or  statutory  funding mechanism.  It  is  well  settled  that  even  an  expenditure  that  may  be  reasonably  related  to  a general  appropriation  may not  be paid out of that appropriation  where the expenditure falls specifically  within  the  scope  of  another  appropriation.    The  fact  that  the  more  specific appropriation may be exhausted is immaterial. 7.8.  Bona Fide Need Rule.  The statute 31 USC §1502(a), is commonly referred to as the “bona fide  needs  rule,”  which  provides  that  fixed  period  appropriations  are  only  available  for  the legitimate  needs  arising  during  the  period  of  availability  for  which  they  were  made.  Thus,  an agency  may  not  obligate  current  appropriations  for  the  bona  fide  needs  of  future  fiscal  years without statutory authority. 7.8.1.  One provision of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, codified at 41 USC §3903, provides a statutory exception to the bona fide needs rule. Section 3903 authorizes executive agencies to obligate current appropriations to enter a multiyear contract for the acquisition of both  nonseverable  and severable  services  for the  bona  fide needs  of  up  to  five  fiscal  years.  The  bona  fide  needs  rule  applies  to  cost-reimbursement  contracts,  just  as  it  does  to  other contract types.  Refer to GAO Decision B-322455, 16 Aug 2013. 7.8.2.  An agency  may use a cost-reimbursement contract to procure severable services that cross  fiscal  years  if  done  in  conjunction  with  multiyear  contracting  authority.  When modifying  a  cost-reimbursement  contract  to  procure  additional  severable  services  and  thus raising the cost ceiling, an agency must ensure that the modification complies with the bona fide needs rule, as the modification represents a new obligation.  (T-0). 7.9.  Budget  Authority,  Obligations,  and  Outlays  (payments).  These  are  the  primary benchmarks and measures of the budget control system. 7.9.1.  Congress  enacts  laws  that  provide  agencies  with  spending  authority  in  the  form  of budget authority. 7.9.2.  Agencies use  budget authority to  enter into  binding agreements to  purchase items or services or to make grants or other payments. These agreements are recorded as obligations of  the  United  States  and  are  deducted  from  the  amount  of  budgetary  resources  available  to the  agency.  The  standards  for  the  proper  recording  of  obligations  are  found  in  31  USC §1501.  The  primary  purpose  of  this  law  is  to  ensure  only  those  transactions  which  meet specified standards for legitimate obligations are recorded. Once these standards are met, the transaction must be recorded as an obligation. 7.9.3.  When payments are made, the obligations are liquidated and outlays (disbursements) recorded.  Outlays  are  the  measure  of  Government  spending.    The  budget  records  outlays when obligations are paid, in the amount that is paid. 7.10.  Authorization  Act  versus  Appropriations  Act.  Congress  has  established  an authorization-appropriation  process  that  provides  for  two  separate  types  of  measures— AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   35  authorization bills and appropriation bills. These measures perform different functions and are to be considered in sequence. 7.10.1.  Authorization bills establish, continue, or modify agencies or programs. 7.10.2.  Appropriations  bills  provide  funding  for  the  agencies  and  programs  previously authorized. 7.11.  DHP  Funds  Transferred  Among  Air  Force,  Army,  and  Navy  Medical Services.  Internal  DHP  Military  Interdepartmental  Purchase  Requests  (MIPRs)  issued  on  a reimbursable  basis  (Category  I)  are  prohibited.    Internal  reprogramming  transactions  between DHP components must be coordinated with AF/SGY thru AFMOA/SGAR.  All requests must be identified  as  one-time  or  permanent  realignments  and  will  be  tracked  throughout  PPBE  cycle.  Concurrence  by  all  parties  and  a  signed  Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA)  must  be  enacted prior to release of the FADs to ensure transfer and obligation of funds by the receiving entity is completed in the least amount of time possible.  (T-1). 7.12.  Direct Care Workload Shifts to the Private Sector.  Headquarters Activities and MTFs must manage their budgets within the funds provided.  Management decisions that may result in shifts of patient care workload from MTFs to the Private Sector should not be made without prior coordination and agreement (obtained via the AFMS Corporate process) and with the appropriate TRICARE  Regional  Office  (TRO).    To  the  extent  capable,  MTFs  should  strive  to  prevent workload shifts to the Private Sector. 7.13.  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)/DoD  Joint  Incentive  Fund  (JIF)  Program  and  DoD/VA Resource Sharing Agreements.  Refer to AFI 41-126, Department of Defense/Veterans Affairs Health Care Resource Sharing Program. 7.14.  Operations  Under  a  Continuing  Resolution  Authority  (CRA).  A  CRA  is  an  interim appropriation,  enacted  to  provide  authority  for  specific  ongoing  activities  in  the  event  that regular appropriations have not been enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year or the expiration of  the  previous  CRA.    A  CRA  has  a  fixed  life  and  provides  the  authority  necessary  to  allow operations to continue in the absence of appropriations. 7.14.1.  The  United  States  Government  cannot  expend  any  funds  unless  they  have  been appropriated by an act of Congress.  Congress only appropriates funds one year at a time; the fiscal year begins on 1 October.  If all appropriations acts are not enacted by 1 October, a law continuing  the  appropriations  from  the  previous  year  must  be  enacted  in  order  to  avoid  a shutdown of the federal government.  This  act is called a Continuing Resolution because it continues appropriations authority from the prior fiscal year. 7.14.2.  A CR consists of titles that correspond to each appropriations bill not enacted at that time. The CR will have explicit language stating the length of time it is in effect.  This period is  usually  short  and  is  an  estimate  of  how  long  it  will  take  Congress  to  finish  work  on  the appropriations bills. 7.14.3.  There  have  been  times  when  particular  parts  of  the  Government  were  funded  by  a CR for an entire fiscal year because of political disputes.  If an appropriations bill is enacted during the time the CR is in effect, the provisions in the CR become null. 7.14.4.  Basic budget execution rules under CRA.    36  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 7.14.4.1.  CRA  usually  specifies  a  maximum  rate  at  which  obligations  may  be  incurred based  on  a  percentage  of  the  previous  fiscal  year’s  enacted  position,  the  President’s budget  request,  and  other  relevant  adjustments.    Obligations  under  CRA  are  usually controlled by apportionment. There is no “standard” CRA language. Each CRA enacted must be carefully  read for the specific provisions pertaining to  the particular  fiscal year being addressed. 7.14.4.2.  No  “New  Starts”  may  be  initiated.  “A  program,  subprogram,  modification, project,  or  subproject  not  previously  justified  by  the  Department  and  funded  by  the Congress  through  the  normal  budget  process  is  considered  to  be  a  new  start.” (DoDFMR, Vol 3, Chap 6). 7.14.4.2.1.  To help clarify what Congress means by “new start,” Congress included the following statement in the FY99 Defense Appropriations Bill, HAC Report 105-591, New Start Notification. “To fulfill its constitutional responsibilities, Congress must know prior to the obligation of any funds when the Department plans to start programs, projects, subprojects or modifications that were not specifically explained in the budget justification material supporting a Presidential budget request for which a subsequent appropriation was made. New starts pertain to specific appropriation line-items and include any new programs, projects, subprojects, or modifications that were not disclosed to Congress in the justification material. A new start occurs even when such activities may be funded in another appropriation belonging to the same or different military department or defense agency. Since the existing DoD financial management policies governing the new start notification process have failed, the Committee bill includes a new general provision (Section 8103) which prohibits compensation of any DoD employee who initiates a new start program without following the proper procedures required by the DoD financial management regulations.” 7.14.4.2.2.  Per  AFI  65-601  V1,  Chapter  2,  a  new  start  is  a  program,  subprogram, modification,  project  or  subproject,  regardless  of  amount,  not  explicitly  and previously justified to, and funded by, the Congress in a given appropriation through the  normal  budget  process.  This  includes  any  effort  that  is  not  described  in  the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) or Procurement Justification Books accompanying the President’s Budget (PB). 7.14.4.2.2.1.  For investment accounts, the aggregate level of budget line items as identified  in  the  President’s  Budget  P-1  and  R-1  justification  documents  and related classified annexes and reports as subsequently modified by Congressional action. 7.14.4.2.2.2.  For  O&M  and  Military  Personnel  accounts,  new  starts  would  be significant  new  programs  that  have  not  been  explicitly  justified  to  Congress  in budget  justification  material.  Refer  to  the  documents  for  the  program  level identification and the detailed narrative justification for specific activities. level  of 7.14.4.2.2.3.  Sub-Program/Project/Sub-Project:  The  most  specific budgeted  items  identified  in  the  President's  Budget  justification  documents  and related classified annexes.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   37  7.14.4.3.  No increase in scope of ongoing programs is permitted. 7.14.4.4.  No new multiyear procurements are permitted. 7.15.  Availability  of  Appropriations  to  Pay  Obligations.  The  provisions  of  31  USC  §1553 require that: 7.15.1.  When an account is  “expired” the account retains its fiscal year identity and remains available  for  recording,  adjusting,  and  liquidating  obligations  properly  chargeable  to  that account. 7.15.2.  After  an  account    is  “canceled”,  obligations  and  adjustments  to  obligations  that would  have  been  properly  chargeable  to  that  account,  both  as  to  purpose  and  in  amount, before  closing,  and  that  are  not  otherwise  chargeable  to  any  current  appropriation  account, may be charged to any current appropriation available for the same purpose. 7.15.3.  Canceled  appropriations  do  not  eliminate  the  Government's  legal  obligation  to  pay contractors for services rendered or products delivered.  Nor does it nullify the need for the accounting  activity  to  maintain  an  audit  trail  supporting  the  existing  contingent  liability  to future appropriations. 7.15.4.  Obligating  Prior  Year  Funds.    Generally,  Prior  Year  funds  are  only  available  for adjustments to existing obligations, and not for new obligations. 7.15.5.  Unliquidated Obligations.  Any obligation that has not had a transaction posted (e.g., indicating that services/goods have been received/ delivered) in more than 30 days should be evaluated to determine why payments are not being made.  A contractor’s failure to submit an invoice does not relieve the MTF of its responsibility to follow up with vendors.  MTFs should continue to document follow up monthly until the contract is complete. 7.16.  Use  of  Expired  Accounts  for  Replacement  Contracts.  When  a  contract  citing  an expired  annual  or  multiple  year  appropriation  is  terminated  by  default,  the  funds  obligated  but unexpended  on  the  contract  and  any  unobligated  balance  in  the  appropriation  are  available  to fund the replacement contract in certain situations. 7.17.  Laws which Govern the Federal Budget Execution Process.  Chapters 13, 15, and 33 of Title  31,  United  States Code,  govern  the  process  of  budget  execution.  Among  these,  the  major laws  are  the  Antideficiency  Act,  the  Impoundment  Control  Act,  the  provisions  known  as  the Economy Act which are found in section 1535, the provisions that govern the closing of accounts which are found in sections 1551 through 1555, and provisions of the "Miscellaneous Receipts Act,"  which  is  found  in  section  3302.    The  Antideficiency  Act  requires  OMB  to  apportion  the accounts  and  to  monitor  spending;  prohibits  agencies  from  spending  more  than  the  amounts appropriated  or  apportioned,  whichever  is  lower;  requires  that  agencies  control  their  spending; and provides penalties for overspending. 7.17.1.  Antideficiency Act (codified in Chapters 13 and 15 of Title 31, United States Code), prescribes  rules  and  procedures  for  budget  execution.    The  Antideficiency  Act  is  a  Federal law that: 7.17.1.1.  Prohibits the making of expenditures or the incurring of obligations in advance of an appropriation;    38  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 7.17.1.2.  Prohibits the incurring of obligations or the making of expenditures in excess of amounts available in appropriation or fund accounts unless specifically authorized by law (31 USC § 1341(a)); 7.17.1.3.  Prohibits the acceptance of voluntary or personal services unless authorized by law (31 USC §1342); 7.17.1.4.  Requires  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB),  via  delegation  from the  President,  to  apportion  appropriated  funds  and  other  budgetary  resources  for  all executive branch agencies (31 USC §1512); 7.17.1.5.  Requires a system of administrative controls within each agency (see 31 USC §1514 for the administrative divisions established); 7.17.1.6.  Prohibits  incurring  any  obligation  or  making  any  expenditure  in  excess  of  an apportionment or reapportionment or in excess of other subdivisions established pursuant to  sections  1513  and  1514  of  title  31  of  the  United  States  Code  (31  USC  §1517);  and specifies penalties for deficiencies (see Antideficiency Act Violation). 7.17.2.  Antideficiency  Act  (ADA)  Violations.    Refer  to  AFI  65-608,  Antideficiency  Act Violations, for guidance on the process involving investigations of potential ADA violations.  Generally, an ADA occurs when one or more of the following happens: 7.17.2.1.  Overobligation  or  overexpenditure  of  an  appropriation  or  fund  account  (31 USC §1341(a)); 7.17.2.2.  Entering into a contract or making an obligation in advance of an appropriation, unless specifically authorized by law (31 USC §1341(a)); 7.17.2.3.  Acceptance of voluntary service, unless authorized by law (31 USC §1342); or 7.17.2.4.  Overobligation or  overexpenditure of an apportionment or  reapportionment  or amounts permitted by the administrative control of funds regulations (31 USC §1517(a)). 7.17.3.  Once it has been determined that there has been an ADA violation, the agency head must report all relevant facts and a statement of actions taken to the President and Congress and submit a copy of the report to the Comptroller General.   Penalties for ADA violations include administrative discipline, such as suspension from duty without pay or removal from office. In addition, an officer or employee convicted of willfully and knowingly violating the law shall be fined not more than $5,000, imprisoned for not more than 2 years, or both.  (T-0). 7.17.4.  Other Relevant Laws. 7.17.4.1.  Government  Performance  and  Results  Act  of  1993  (Public  Law  103–62,  as amended)  which  emphasizes  managing  for  results.  It  requires  agencies  to  prepare strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance reports. 7.17.4.2.  Government  Performance  and  Results  Modernization  Act  of  2010  (GPRMA),  which creates a more defined performance framework by defining a governance structure and  by  better  connecting  plans,  programs  and  performance  information.    GPRMA requires the federal government to set government-wide goals and to align programs from different agencies to work together to reduce overlap and duplication.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   39  7.17.4.3.  The Chief Financial Officer and Federal Financial Reform Act of 1990, or CFO Act,  signed  into  law  on  November  15,  1990,  is  a  United  States  federal  law  intended  to improve  the  government's  financial  management,  outlining  standards  of  financial performance  and  disclosure.  Among  other  measures,  the  Office  of  Management  and Budget (OMB) was given greater authority over federal financial management. For each of  the  24  federal  departments  and  agencies,  the  position  of  CFO  was  created.  In accordance with the CFO Act, each agency or department vests its financial management functions in its CFO. 7.17.4.4.  The Budget and Accounting Act requires the President to submit a budget. The President  formally  transmits  his  proposals  for  allocating  resources  to  the  Congress through  the  budget.    The  Congress  considers  the  recommendations  and  uses  the information  included in the budget  as it drafts and passes  laws that  affect spending and receipts. Through this process the Government decides how much money to spend, what to spend it on, and how to raise the money it has decided to spend. 7.18.  Key Federal Agencies in the Federal Budget Process. 7.18.1.  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB).    Part  of  the  Executive  Office  of  the President, OMB's predominant mission is to assist the President in overseeing the preparation of  the  President’s  Budget  and  to  supervise  its  administration  by  the  Executive  Branch agencies.  OMB  evaluates  the  effectiveness  of  agency  programs,  policies,  and  procedures, assesses  competing  funding  demands  among  agencies,  and  sets  funding  priorities.  OMB ensures that agency reports, rules, testimony, and proposed legislation are consistent with the President's  Budget  and  with  Administration  policies.  In  addition,  OMB  oversees  and coordinates  the  Administration's  procurement,  financial  management,  and  information  and regulatory policies. In each of these areas, OMB's primary role is to improve administrative management,  develop  better  performance  measures  and  coordinating  mechanisms,  and reduce  any  unnecessary  burdens  on  the  public.    For  further  information,  refer  to  the  OMB web site. 7.18.2.  The  Department  of  the  Treasury,  Financial  Management  Service  (FMS).    Treasury, acting  through  FMS,  disburses  a  billion  Federal  payments  like  Social  Security,  veterans' benefits, and income tax refunds to more than 100 million people (Note:  The DoD does not use FMS to disburse its funds; instead, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) performs  DoD’s  disbursing.).    The  Treasury  collects  more  than  $2  trillion  in  Federal revenues;  oversees  a  daily  cash  flow  of  $10  billion;  provides  centralized  debt  collection services  to  most  Federal  agencies  (including  the  AFMS);  and  provides  Government-wide accounting  and  reporting.   FMS  gathers  and  publishes  Government-wide  financial information  that  is  used  by  the  public  and  private  sectors  to  monitor  the  Government's financial status and establish fiscal and monetary policies. 7.18.3.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO).  Part of the Legislative Branch, CBO was created by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. CBO's mission is  to  provide  the  Congress  with  the  objective,  timely,  non-partisan  analyses  needed  for economic  and  budget  decisions  and  with  the  information  and  estimates  required  for  the congressional  budget  process.  CBO  prepares  analyses  and  estimates  relating  to  the  budget and the economy and presents options and alternatives for the Congress to consider but does not make recommendations on policy. CBO’s services can be grouped into four categories:    40  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 helping  the  Congress  formulate  a  budget  plan;  helping  it  stay  within  that  plan;  helping  it assess  the  impact  of  Federal  mandates;  and  helping  it  consider  issues  related  to  the  budget and economic policy.  For further information, refer to the CBO web site. 7.18.4.  The  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO).    Part  of  the  Legislative  Branch, GAO  is  the  investigative  arm  of  the  Congress.  GAO  helps  the  Congress  meet  its Constitutional  responsibilities  and  helps  improve  the  performance  and  accountability  of  the Federal  Government  for  the  American  people.  GAO  examines  the  use  of  public  funds, evaluates Federal programs and activities, and provides analyses, options, recommendations, and  other  assistance  to  help  the  Congress  make  effective  oversight,  policy,  and  funding decisions. In this context, GAO works to continuously improve the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness  of  the  Federal  Government  through  financial  audits,  program  reviews  and evaluations, analyses, legal opinions, investigations, and other services.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   41  Chapter 8 FINANCIAL DATA ELEMENTS AND CODES 8.1.  Overview.  Fiscal  coding  affects  all  levels  from  MTFs  to  HQ  USAF,  OSD,  Treasury, and Congress.    Financial/resource  managers  at  all  Air  Force  organizational  levels  must  understand and  accurately  apply  the  fiscal  coding  structure  and  values  that  are  vital  for  data  integrity  and appropriate  financial  fiduciary  reporting.    This  chapter  provides  source  references  for  data elements and account codes used in budget and financial management. 8.2.  Relevant  Financial  Definitions.  In  order  to  properly  manage  funds,  it’s  vital  that managers at all levels have a financial foundation comprised of basic financial terminology and concepts.    Understanding  the  financial  terminology  used  in  an  RMO  setting  is  essential  to communicating with peers and leadership.  Below are a few terms RMOs should understand. 8.2.1.  Statutory/Regulatory  Funding  Limitations.  Limitations  imposed  because  of  either Congressional  action  to  include  provisions  of  the  United  States  Code  (USC),  annual authorization  and  appropriations  acts,  or  other  legislation,  or  a  determination  made administratively by DoD or the Air Force. 8.2.2.  BAG Balancing.  The RMO must balance to the Budget Activity Group (BAG) level.  No  realignment  between  BAGs  is  authorized.  AF/SGY  must  be  notified  immediately  for emergency reprogramming actions.  (T-1). 8.2.3.  Target  Loading.    Budget  authority  loaded  into  accounting  systems  must  match  the authority  distributed  via  FADs.    Each  funding  document  received  must  be  recorded  in  the accounting  system  at  the  correct  amount,  with  a  valid  document  ID,  to  the  corresponding appropriation,  fund  type,  and  reporting  entity.    (T-0).    This  is  one  of  the  key  areas  MTF RMOs  must  comply  with  to  assist  the  Air  Force  in  achieving  audit  readiness.    AF/SGY closely  monitors  adherence  to  the  requirements  outlined  in  paragraph  17.5.1,  Budget Authority.  The AF Form 1269, Request for Load or Change in Fund Targets (or equivalent documentation) must be filed as supporting documentation for 6 years and 3 months.  (T-1). 8.2.4.  Funds  Holder.  The  Air  Force  DHP  Funds  Holder  is  the  Air  Force  Surgeon  General.  Generally, the commander or head of an operating agency, installation or organizational unit to  whom  an  apportionment,  allocation,  suballocation,  allotment,  suballotment,  operating budget authority is issued, is designated as the Funds Holder. 8.2.5.  Administrative  Subdivision  of  Funds.  Any  subdivision  of  an  appropriation  or  other fund that makes funds available in a specified amount for incurring obligations, or which can be further subdivided to make funds available in a specified amount for incurring obligations, subject  to  limits  in  the  funding  documents,  statutes,  regulations,  or  other  applicable directives.  AF/SGY receives a DHP administrative subdivision of funds from the DHA via PBAS and an accompanying FAD. 8.2.6.  Allocation.  Allocations involve making funds available in a specified amount, subject to any limitations on their use, and can be used for making sub-allocations or allotments.  For example, AF/SGY allocates DHP budget authority to AFMOA/SGAR by MAJCOM. 8.2.7.  Allotment.  An  authorization  by  AFMOA/SGAR  to  a  subordinate  installation,  other organizational unit, or to itself to incur obligations within a specified time and amount.    42  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 8.2.8.  Documentary  Evidence  for  Obligations.  All  DHP  obligations  must  be  supported  by documentary evidence (T-0), such as: 8.2.8.1.  A  binding  agreement  in  writing  between  an  agency  and  another  person (including  an  agency),  in  a  way  and  form,  and  for  a  purpose,  authorized  by  law.  The agreement must be executed before the end of the period of availability for obligation of the appropriation. 8.2.8.2.  A binding agreement may include a contract, rental or lease agreement, purchase order,  work  order,  inter-service  support  agreement,  Project  Order,  MIPR,  unqualified notice of award, letter contract, or letter of intent.  The primary purpose is that there be an offer and acceptance imposing liability on both parties. Reference 31 USC §1501. 8.2.9.  FADs.    FAD  amounts  are  the  obligation  authorities  subject  to  the  provisions  of  31 USC §1517 and the DoD Financial Management  Regulation (DoDFMR).   Funds  allocated are to be executed only in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, procedures, and policies  necessary  to  support  the  DHP  appropriation.    The  annual  direct  program  amounts and  the  cumulative  quarterly  total  program  amounts  contained  in  FADs  are  the  obligation authorities  subject  to  31  USC  §1517.    Organizations  that  execute  or  distribute  DHP appropriations  (i.e.,  AF/SGY,  AFMOA/SGAR,  MTF  RMOs)  must  retain  copies  of  all Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) on file for 6 years and 3 months.  (T-0). 8.2.10.  Emergency/Special  Program  (ESP)  Codes.    ESP  Codes  can  be  established  at  SAF, MAJCOM,  or  local  level;  the  higher  management  level  ESP  code  takes  precedence  and determines the value of the last position of the ESP Code.  SAF ESP codes are broken into two  categories:  (1)  Joint  Chief  of  Staff  Exercise  (JCS)  and  (2)  Non-Joint  Chief  of  Staff Exercise which can both be found on the AF Portal. 8.2.11.  Prior  Year  Upward  Obligation  Adjustment    (UOA)  Approval  Process.    The Obligation Adjustment Reporting  System (OARS)  is  used to  approve within-scope contract changes  and  ordinary  prior  year  adjustments.    Routine  prior  year  upward  ordinary adjustments  due  to  disbursements  for  non-contractual  transactions;  civilian  pay,  travel  pay, supply  interface,  and  Government  Purchase  Card  (GPC)  bill  should  be  consolidated  into End-of-Month  (EOM)  OARS.  The  decision  logic  in  OARS  determines  the  proper  approval level  based  on  dollar  amount  and  funding  appropriation.    The  Comptroller,  or  designated representative,  has  the  authority  to  approve  $100K  “within-scope”  contract  for  ordinary adjustments, e.g., accounting errors, claims, ratification actions, and has authority to approve $2M  upward  obligation  adjustments.    Adjustment  greater  than  $100K  “within-scope”  or totaling more than $2M must be approved by AF/SGY, SAF/FMBMM, and DHA. 8.2.12.  Budget Execution Reports (BERs).  The BER is a tool used between the  RMO and the  Operating  Agency  Code  (OAC)  manager  at  AFMOA/SGAR,  and  covers  all  major elements of expense.  Used correctly, the BER documents how an MTF has used and will use its resources, and identifies potential sources of excess funds and shortfalls. 8.2.13.  Object  Class  Codes  (OCCs).    OCCs  are  governed  by  OMB  Circular  A-11, Preparation, Submission and Execution of the Budget. OCCs are categories in a classification system  that  represent  obligations  by  the  items  or  services  purchased  by  the  Federal Government.    Major  object  classes  are  divided  into  smaller  classes.    The  object  classes represent obligations according to their initial purpose, not the end product or service, i.e., if  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   43  you  pay  a  Federal  employee  who  constructs  a  building,  you  should  classify  the  obligations for the employee's wages under Personnel compensation and benefits, rather than Acquisition of assets. If you purchase a building, classify the contractual obligations under Acquisition of assets. The Federal government uses the following major object classes: 8.2.13.1.  OCC 10 – Represents personnel compensation and benefits.  This major object class  includes  smaller  object  classes  11,  12,  and  13.    For  example,  Object  Class  111 represents  full-time  permanent  employee  compensation.   Within  AF  accounting structures,  there  is  a  direct  correlation  between  the  smaller  Object  Classes  and  the  AF Element  of  Expense  Investment  Codes  (EEICs)  and  the  DoD  Standard  Financial Information Structure (SFIS). 8.2.13.2.  OCC  20  –  Represents  contractual  services  and  supplies.    This  major  OCC covers purchases of contractual services and supplies in object classes 21.0 through 26.0.  For  example,  object  class  210  represents  travel  and  transportation  of  persons;  while object class 254 represents operation and maintenance of facilities. 8.2.13.3.  OCC  30  –  Represents  acquisition  of  assets.    This  major  OCC  covers  object classes 31.0 through 33.0.  For example, object class 310 represents equipment and object class 320 represents land and structures. 8.2.13.4.  OCC 40 – Represents grants and fixed charges.  This major OCC covers object classes 41.0 through 44.0.  For example, object class 420 represents insurance claims and indemnities, 430 reflects interest and dividends, and 440 reflects refunds. 8.2.13.5.  OCC  90  –  Represents    other  charges.    This  major  OCC  covers  object  classes 91.0 through 99.5.  For example, object class 940 represents financial transfers. 8.2.14.  EEIC.    Like  the  object  classes,  an  EEIC  represents  the  type  of  commodity  being purchased.  The list of EEIC used in the AF are published in the Financial Management Data Quality  Service  (FMDQS),  https://fmdd.affsc.af.mil/data-elements/home.  FMDQS  is  the authoritative  source  for  identifying  valid  financial  management  data  element  values and codes.  Refer to Table 8.4. for commonly used EEICs used within the AFMS. 8.2.15.  Responsibility Center/Cost Center (RC/CC).  An RC/CC represents the work center incurring  costs/charges.    The  list  of  RC/CCs  used  in  the  AF  are  published  in  the  FMDQS.  Within  the  AFMS,  RC/CCs  are  mapped  to  MEPRS  codes.    Refer  to  AFI  41-102  for  more information on MEPRS. 8.2.16.  DHP  O&M  Budget  Activity  Groups  (BAGs)  &  Program  Element  (PE)  Structure.  DHP funding is programmed and executed in BAGs and PEs (often referred to as PE Codes or PECs).  Some of DHP funding is allocated to MTFs, some to HQ activities, and some is retained by the DHA.  For example, BAG 2 (Private Sector Care funds) is executed by the DHA for Managed Care Support Contracts (TRICARE contracts).  Refer to Table 8.1. below for a list of commonly used DHP BAGs and PEs (not all-inclusive). 8.3.  Fiscal Code Architecture. 8.3.1.  SAF/FMPS, with inputs from Air Staff, develops fiscal coding guidance and provides annual updates through an ongoing effort to refine fiscal code values, titles, and definitions as directed by Congress, OMB, DoD, and AF.    44  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 8.3.2.  The fiscal coding structure and values have been strengthened over the past few years to ensure the most efficient coding architecture is available to capture the budget formulation and budget execution information based on business needs for reporting information to DoD echelons. 8.3.3.  Properly  coding  obligations  is  extremely  important.      Fiscal  coding  is  an  important part  of  data  integrity  and  carries  an  equal  weight  with  financial  management  fiduciary reporting requirements.  Fiscal coding affects all levels, from installation through HQ USAF and subsequently to OSD(C), OMB, the Treasury and Congress. 8.4.  AF Accounting Systems.  The legacy AF accounting system is the General Accounting and Finance  System  (GAFS).    The  AF  is  transitioning  to  the  new  AF  accounting  system—the Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS). 8.4.1.  GAFS  Line  of  Accounting  (LoA)/Fund  Cite.    The  LoA/fund  cite  used  at  AF installations  that  have  not  transitioned  to  DEAMS  contains  the  data  elements  reflected  in Table 8.2 8.4.2.  DEAMS  LoA/Fund  Cite.    The  DEAMS  LoA  is  reflective  of  the  DoD  Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS).  Refer to Table 8.3. 8.5.  Fiscal  Code  Support.  RMOs  should  address  any  comments/concerns  regarding  cost structure, program elements or budget line items to AFMOA/SGAR for review. 8.5.1.  If requests are being made for additional EEICs or RC/CCs, the request must provide a suggested title and a narrative description to adequately describe the costs being captured.  If  a  policy  change/directive  is  driving  the  need  for  an  additional  EEIC  or  RC/CC,  that reference  must  be  cited/included  in  the  request.    Requests  must  be  submitted  to AFMOA/SGAR for preliminary review/approval.  If approved, AFMOA/SGAR will forward the  request  to  AF/SGY  for  final  approval.    AF/SGY  will  forward  approved  requests  to SAF/FMP for inclusion in the Air Force Data Quality Service (DQS).  (T-1). 8.5.2.  IAW  AFI  65-601  V1,  only  valid  RC/CCs  found  in  the  FMDQS  may  be  used.    The FMDQS provides a query tool capability to  find the fiscal code associated with the type of service being put on funding documents. 8.5.3.  See  AFMAN  65-604,  Appropriation  Symbols  and  Budget  Codes,  for  annual appropriation symbols, budget codes and descriptions. Table 8.1.

Stages of Accounting. 8.6.1.  Disbursement Accounting. 8.6.1.1.  Commitments. A commitment is an administrative reservation of funds.  It is an intent to incur an obligation.  Commitments constitute the first stage in the commitment and obligation concepts.  It is represented in the BQ system as Balance ID (BID) “C”. 8.6.1.2.  Obligations.  An obligation represents an order placed with a vendor, a contract awarded, a service received, or any transaction that constitutes a legal requirement for a  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   51  vendor  to  furnish  supplies  or  services.    Obligations  are  the  second,  third,  and  fourth stages of the commitment and obligation concept.  These 3 stages are: 8.6.1.2.1.  Undelivered  Orders  Outstanding  (UOO).  This  stage  of  obligation represents those orders, contracts, or agreements that have been placed, but have not yet  been  received.    The  funds  are  obligated  in  anticipation  of  delivery  of goods/services.  This process reduces the commitment stage and increases the UOO stage.  The UOO stage is represented in BQ as BID “O”. 8.6.1.2.2.  Accrued Expenditures Unpaid (AEU).  Upon notice that goods are received or  services  rendered  (typically  by  receipt  of  an  invoice  from  the  vendor),  the  UOO stage  is  reduced  and  AEU  is  increased  by  the  amount  involved.    This  stage  of obligation represents the amount of funds owed (accounts payable).  The AEU stage is represented in BQ as BID “U”. 8.6.1.2.3.  Accrued  Expenditures  Paid  (AEP).    This  stage  reflects  the  actual vouchered payment for the material, assets, or services.  When the payment (outlay or disbursement) is made, the AEU decreases while the AEP stage increases.  AEP stage is reflected in BQ as BID “E”. Table 8.5.  Disbursement Codes.

Reimbursement Accounting.  Accounting for the sale of goods and services by the Air Force  is  similar  to  obligation  accounting.    Just  as  the  commitment/obligation  concept  has stages of accountability, reimbursement accounting also has stages associated with it.  These stages are: 8.6.2.1.  Unfilled Customer Orders (UFCO).  Orders that have been received for supplies or  services  that  have  not  been  provided  yet  (e.g.,  accepting  a  MIPR  in  return  for providing a service).  The UFCO stage is represented as BID “D”. 8.6.2.2.  Filled  Customer  Orders-Uncollected  (FCOU).    These  are  orders  for  goods  or services  that  have  been  provided  to  the  requesting  activity,  but  reimbursement  has  not been  collected.    This  is  the  stage  of  reimbursement  accounting  where  the  billing documentation  is  prepared  and  processed.    Relating  to  commercial  accounting,  this  is called an “accounts receivable”. It is represented in BQ as BID “F”. 8.6.2.3.  Filled Customer Orders Collected (FCOC).  This stage represents the final stage of  reimbursement  accounting  and  are  the  amounts  received  as  payments  from  goods delivered or services rendered.  It is represented in BQ as BID “R”.      52  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 Table 8.6.  Reimbursement BIDs.   BID D F R Reimbursement Codes Acronym  Description UFCO FCOU FCOC Unfilled Customer Orders Filled Customer Orders Uncollected Filled Customer Orders Collected 8.6.3.  Post Codes.  In BQ, a post code is a balance identifier code that uses 2-position alpha codes which have a direct affect on the BIDs.  The first position of the post code identifies which  BID  to  decrease.    The  second  position  of  the  post  code  identifies  which  BID  to increase.  As example, in disbursement accounting, when the processing center (PC) inputs a transaction with post code UE, it reduces the U balance and increases the E balance. Table 8.7.  Post Codes.

Freight charges are common payments that are straight paid.  Example:  You order an item and don’t realize that shipping charges are not included in the price of the goods (therefore were not included in the original obligation).  When the freight charge arrives, it must be paid citing your funds.  In effect, the obligation and payment for the freight charges will occur simultaneously.

This is a payment that has been made but cannot be matched to an obligation.  This commonly occurs with By-Others transactions. 8.6.5.  For-Others/By-Others  Transactions. transactions  occur  when  another disbursing  station  uses  your  fund  cite  for  an  authorized  payment.    The  following  is  an example of a For-Others/By-Others transaction:   These Example:  Army Sgt Joe Smith from another base travels TDY to your base on official business.  Because your base requested this individual, you authorized Sgt Smith’s unit to use your fund cite for his TDY orders.  In other words, your unit is paying for Sgt Smith’s TDY.  When Sgt Smith returns to his home station and files his travel voucher, it will be paid using your funds.  This is a For-Others/By-Others payment.    54  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 9 FUNDING FOR MEDICAL READINESS PROGRAMS 9.1.  Overview.  The  AF/SG  operates  the  DHP  account  for  Air  Force  non-combat  support medical activities. This means that DHP use  for medical readiness activities shall be limited to those activities that organize, train, and equip our medical personnel. DHP will only be used for medical-specific training needs.  (T-1). 9.2.  Identifying  Contingency-related  Costs.  MTFs  will  collect  all  applicable  costs  related  to specific  contingency  operations  or  other  military  operations,  and  will  report  these  costs  in accordance with SAF/FM or AF/SGY guidance.  (T-1). 9.3.  Approval to Use DHP Funds for Medical Readiness Training/Exercises.  DHP used for medical readiness training and exercises not already specified in AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Program  Management,  will  occur  only  after  the  Readiness  Training  and  Oversight  Committee (RTOC) has reviewed, validated and prioritized all submitted requirements, and presented their recommendation list to the Medical Readiness Panel for approval.  This does not preclude DHP for  participation in  unit-level  or  wing-level  exercises  conducted as  part of  a  Unit  Effectiveness Inspection  (UEI)  or  operational  readiness  inspection  or  for  participation  in  other  unit  or  wing-level exercises such as mass casualty or deployment exercises.  (T-1). 9.4.  Funding  for  LAF/Combatant  Command  (CCMD)  Directed  Exercises.  Exercises  in which  AFMS  personnel  are  directed  to  participate  will  not  be  funded  with  DHP  funds.    They must  be  funded  with  appropriations  specifically  provided  for  such  purpose,  e.g.  Line/directing entity (e.g., CCMD, JCS,  or Joint Service) or O&M funds available for HCA, such as Overseas Humanitarian,  Disaster  and  Civic  Assistance  funds  (10  USC  §401),  Combatant  Commander’s Initiative  Funds  (10  USC  §166a)  or  other  funds  deemed  appropriate  in  accordance  with applicable  fiscal  law  and  policy.    DHP  will  only  be  used  for  exercises  in  which  the  medical service  (through  the  RTOC/MR  Panel)  requests  to  participate  in  and  only  when  the  exercise provides a clear training benefit. With few exceptions, training should be directly related to unit type codes (UTCs).  (T-1). 9.5.  Special  Categories.  The  following  special  categories/circumstances  are  provided  to  help clarify the fiscal rules pertaining to funding for medical readiness activities: 9.5.1.  CCMD  and  LAF/Component  Support.    Missions  that  are  part  of  a  CCMD  or component  support  (Numbered  Air  Forces)  to  a  theater  security  cooperation  objective  or some other theater requirement should not be confused with AFMS-driven activities.  IAW AFI  65-601  V1,  Chapter  10,  any  expenses  attributed  to  the  contingency  deployment, employment,  and  redeployment  of  medical  combat  support  personnel,  equipment  and supplies  requested  by  the  CCMD  and  approved  by  proper  authority,  as  well  as  medical Biological  Warfare/Chemical  Warfare  items  supporting  deploying  personnel,  are  paid  by LAF  funds.  CCMD/component  support  missions  involve  mission  execution  and  should  be funded through normal (and legal) CCMD/component line funding sources. 9.5.2.  Medical Readiness Training Exercises (MEDRETEs) in Foreign Countries. 9.5.2.1.  All  MEDRETE  proposals  (GME  &  non-GME)  must  first  be  submitted  for review to the MAJCOM/NAF/SG to ensure activities are consistent with and supportive  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   55  of  CCMD  and  AF  stated  theater  security  and  stability  plan  objectives.    Following  their review  and  concurrence,  the  MAJCOM/NAF/SG  staff  will  forward  requests  to  the AF/SG3X.  (T-1). 9.5.2.2.  Medical readiness training proposals will be reviewed by the Readiness Training Oversight  Committee  (RTOC)  who  will  make  their  recommendation  to  the  Medical Readiness Panel for approval. Additionally, for proposals in support of GME programs, AF/SG3X will forward to the Force Development Panel for their review/approval.  (T-1). 9.5.2.3.  All requests must: 9.5.2.3.1.  Delineate  concrete  training  objectives  to  be  fulfilled  along  with  the reference  document  that  identifies/directs  the  training  requirement.    If  the  request  is related  to  a  GME  program,  it  must  identify  the  ACGME  Competencies  that  will  be met.    Documentation  should  also  reflect  that  the  Residency  Review  Committee  has reviewed  these  rotational  experiences  as  part  of  their  overall  periodic  program curriculum validation, and confirmed that the stated ACGME Competencies are being met. 9.5.2.3.2.  Contain an explanation to strongly support a "bona fide need" to pursue the training specifically in the foreign country and not at home stations/MTF/installation clinical/readiness training setting (why the proposed training in the foreign country is the most efficient/effective means to achieve the training objectives). 9.5.2.3.3.  State the duration and projected costs for the mission. 9.5.2.3.4.  State the number of personnel (by AFSC). 9.5.2.3.5.  State the equipment and source of equipment. 9.5.2.3.6.  State  the  extent  of  involvement  by  any  other  federal  agency,  Non-Government Organization (NGO), AF or other military dept. 9.5.2.4.  The  Force  Development  and  Medical  Readiness  Panels  will  review  their respective  proposals  for  bona  fide  clinical/medical  readiness  training  needs  while  being mindful  of  mission law, Congressional and media perceptions. requirements/capabilities, resource  constraints, fiscal 9.5.3.  Innovative  Readiness  Training.    Governed  by  10  USC  §2012  and  DoD  Directive 1100.20,  Support  and  Services  for  Eligible  Organizations  and  Activities  Outside  the Department  of  Defense,  and  AFI  36-2250,  Civil-Military  Innovative  Readiness  Training (IRT).    IRT  is  a  civilian-military  partnership  program  that  builds  interoperability  and readiness  for  our  military  while  simultaneously  providing  a  benefit  to  communities throughout  the  United  States  and  its  territories.  This  program  is  a  partnership  between requesting community organizations and the military; therefore resource support is a "shared" responsibility.  Individual  IRT  Projects  provide  commanders  another  option  to  meet  their mobilization  readiness  requirements,  enhancing  morale  and  contributing  to  military recruiting  and  retention.  As  in  overseas  deployments,  these  projects  should  be  incorporated into future unit training plans and budgets. 9.5.4.  Air  Force  Reserve  and  Air  National  Guard  Components  (hereafter  referred  to  as  the Reserve  Component  (RC)).    Specific  funds  are  appropriated  by  Congress  for  both  the  Air    56  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 Force  Reserve  and  Air  National  Guard.  This  includes  expenses  of  personnel  undergoing active duty training or performing inactive duty training as authorized by law. 9.5.4.1.  The  use  of  DHP  funding  for  exercises  and  training  events  involving  the  RC  is limited  to  support  for  the  active  duty  Unit  Type  Code  (UTC)  structure  and  exercise execution.    The  RC  may  fill  UTC  positions,  white  cell  positions,  or  planning  positions required  by  the  AC  to  successfully  execute  any  exercise  or  training  event.    RC  will  be responsible for their own TDY man-days, unless acting in the role of the Pilot Unit.  All RC Pilot Unit duties may be fully DHP funded.  Training will be documented in the MET format  for  the  units  and  personnel  participating.    This  policy  supports  the  AF/SG CONOPS on Total Force Integration.  (T-1). 9.5.4.2.  DHP  funding  will  not  be  used  to  operate  RC-sponsored  training  or  exercises (e.g.  start  up  and  sustainment  costs  including  but  not  limited  to  salaries,  gas,  light, electricity, rental of space, new equipment). Exceptions to these general principles are as follows: 9.5.4.2.1.  If  additional  (outside  the  scope  of  the  initial  exercise  scenario)  exercise criteria  is  added,  ALL  associated  costs  with  the  additional  criteria  will  be  borne  by the requesting component. 9.5.4.2.2.  If a component cannot provide sufficient personnel and requests assistance from the other component, TDY expenses will be borne by the requesting component. 9.5.4.2.3.  Mixing  resources  (man-days  and  travel  costs)  between  RC  and  AC  is acceptable  if  it  clearly  benefits  the  Total  Force  and  mutual  agreement  is  obtained. This  flexibility  should  be  applied  judiciously  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  The participation  of  both  RC  and  AC  does  not  automatically  qualify  as  providing  Total Force  justification  for  the  use  of  DHP  funding  for  all  participants.  If  the  mixing  of funds for a specific event becomes a recurring event, each component should program to fund their own portions of the event in the out years. 9.5.5.  Tri-Service or Joint-Sponsored Training.  The use of DHP during Tri-Service or Joint Sponsored  Training  will  be  limited  to  the  portion  of  the  joint  training  or  exercise  that  is provided for the benefit of AF medical personnel.  (T-0). 9.5.6.  LAF or JCS Exercises.  Primary line O&M (3400) or JCS exercise funds are used for: 9.5.6.1.  The deployment of the EMEDS. 9.5.6.2.  Medical personnel TDY expenses. 9.5.6.3.  Cost  of  supplies  used  during  deployment  and  those  needed  for  resupply  upon return. 9.5.6.4.  “A” and “B” bags for medical personnel. 9.5.6.5.  DHP  funds  shall  be  used  for  anything  done  in  the  medical  facility  prior  to deployment  or  to  backfill  an  MTF  during  an  exercise  deployment  (i.e.,  manning assistance, force protection).  For example, On-line International Health Specialists (IHS) Orientation Course, Rosetta Stone Language Training (for IHS), Public Health Training, Region-specific  Training  (for  IHS),  Regional  Political-Military  Development  Programs (for IHS), Global Medical Readiness Symposium, EMEDS Training.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   57  9.5.7.  International  Health  Specialists.    Funds  allocated  to  the  IHS  program  will  be  used primarily  for  education/training  as  well  as  the  “Care  &  feeding”  of  IHS  staff,  and  not intended  to  be  used  to  fulfill  CCMD  or  LAF  taskings  with  respect  to  building  partnerships and  meeting  Theater  Security  Cooperation  objectives.    (T-1).    Specifically,  allocations  are based upon the following factors: 9.5.7.1.  Attendance  at  courses  needed  for  newly  assigned  IHS  personnel.    These  will include: 9.5.7.1.1.  Yearly educational/training  sustainment  for  existing  IHS  staff  based  upon one TDY for Continuing Medical Education (CME) per FY. 9.5.7.1.2.  Attendance for one IHS person per IHS location at the Program Executive Committee meetings held two times annually. 9.5.7.2.  Appropriate Use of Funds in Support of the IHS Program. 9.5.7.2.1.  Building  partnership  activities  in  other  countries  will  be  funded  by  the CCMD and/or funds specifically appropriated for those purposes.  If available, LAF TDY funds may be used as well to support these activities.  MAJCOM/NAF/SGs may request  funds  from  their  MAJCOM/NAF/CC  and/or  CCMD  for  these  type  of activities and training events. 9.5.7.2.2.  DHP  funds  may be used  to  participate in  Synchronization events (usually hosted by the CCMD to prioritize and plan for future international engagements). 9.5.7.2.3.  DHP  funds  may  be  used  to  participate  in  bilateral  medical  defense meetings with other countries.  The meeting’s primary objective must be to measure the country’s medical capability in order to meet specific AFMS objectives and tailor AFMS training efforts. 9.5.8.  Medical Care at Deployed Locations During Exercises and Contingencies.  Charge to primary Line O&M or JCS exercise/contingency funds, medical care provided to members at local  indigenous  medical  facilities.  Care  in  the  indigenous  facility  includes  referral  care  by military  medical  staff,  medical  supplies  (i.e.,  pharmaceuticals,  orthopedic  braces),  and urgent/ emergency care. 9.6.  Medical  Readiness  DHP  Unfunded  Requirements  (UFRs).  The  Medical  Readiness Panel  is  the  entry  point  for  all  DHP  UFRs  related  to  medical  readiness  with  the  exception  of exercise and training UFRs which go through the RTOC for validation before being submitted to the MR Panel.    58  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 10 MEDICAL RELATED TRAVEL 10.1.  Patients.  Charge  authorized  TDY  costs  of  Air  Force  military  members  and  AF  MTF-enrolled beneficiaries to the MTF’s BAG 1 funds.  This applies when patients are enrolled to the MTF and are referred from their home station to another location outside of the local commuting area (e.g., non-emergency specialty care greater than 100 miles). For Patient Travel, verify that TDY was directed by Competent Medical Authority. (T-0). 10.1.1.  Wounded  Warriors  Returning  from  the  Area  of  Responsibility  (AOR).    Wounded Warriors  returning  from  the  AOR  directly  to  a  medical  center  (e.g.,  to  MTFs  at  Andrews AFB,  Walter-Reed  Army  Medical  Center,  Bethesda  Naval  Medical  Center,  Wilford  Hall Medical  Center)  will  remain  on  their  Deployment/Contingency  Orders  until  they  return  to their  home  station  (these  orders  are  not  DHP-funded).    Do  not  amend  their  orders  to  add  a medical  fund  cite.    Their  deployment  orders  will  terminate  once  they’ve  returned  to  their home station. 10.1.2.  Non-AF  Military.    TDY  costs  of  non-Air  Force  military  members  and  any  non-medical attendants (NMAs) accompanying the military member are the responsibility of the owning military service. 10.1.2.1.  Time  permitting,  AF  MTFs  must  contact  the  member’s  unit  for  assistance  in obtaining a travel fund cite.  If the unit is unwilling or unable to fund the medical TDY, please contact AF/SGY for assistance.  Be sure to include:  Who was contacted (name/e-mail address/phone number), date contacted, a copy of any correspondence received, and a  concise  explanation  of  the  reason  the  member’s  owning  unit  cannot  fund  the  medical TDY.  (T-1). 10.1.2.2.  In the interest of the patient’s safety, do not delay getting the patient to the care needed.  Funding  should be worked out  beforehand only if time permits;  otherwise, the funding  matters  (reimbursement  from  the  member’s  unit/Service)  should  be  resolved after the fact. 10.1.3.  Patient Travel RC/CCs.  MTFs will use the RC/CCs at Table 10.1. to record patient travel costs. Table 10.1.  Patient Travel RC/CCs.

Medical  Referrals  within  the  Local  Permanent  Duty  Station  (PDS)  Area.  Travel  by personally  owned  conveyance  (POC)  to  obtain  medical  care  within  the  local  PDS  area  is reimbursable  only  when  a  member  is  ordered  (see  note  below)  to  a  medical  facility  within  the local  area  to  take  a  required  physical  examination,  or  obtain  a  medical  diagnosis  and/or treatment.    When  ordered,  members  are  considered  to  be  on  official  business  and  must  be reimbursed  for  the  transportation,  unless  government  transportation  is  available.    (T-0).    Note: For  the  purpose  of  determining  if  travel  in  a  POC  is  reimbursable,  a  medical  referral  by competent medical authority alone does not constitute a commander-directed order. 10.2.1.  Scenarios Related to Local Travel. 10.2.1.1.  Travel  for Alcohol  and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT).    A Squadron Commander may “order” a member to the MTF for an ADAPT evaluation.  In this scenario, local travel would only be reimbursable if the MTF could not perform the    60  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 ADAPT  evaluation  and  the  member  had  to  travel  to  the  network  (or  another  MTF)  to obtain the evaluation. 10.2.1.1.1.  Upon presenting for the evaluation (whether performed by the MTF or in the  private  sector),  the  member  has  fulfilled  the  commander’s  “order.”    After obtaining the evaluation, the patient may "opt" (or not) to undergo treatment.  Local area  appointments  (in  the  private  sector)  to  obtain  treatment  are  not  reimbursable.  The  member  is  not  ordered  to  undergo  "medical  treatment"  (that's  the  desired outcome, if the member chooses it).  If the member chooses not to undergo treatment, the  commander  may  state  for  purposes  of  administrative  action  (for  example),  "The member  has  a  medical  condition  that  is  untreated.    The  member  has  been  offered treatment, but has refused.  The untreated condition makes the member unsuitable for continued military service." 10.2.1.1.2.  In terms of travel reimbursement, a member's local travel to participate in ADAPT "treatment" is no different than a member going to referred appointments for other medical treatments (not reimbursed). 10.2.1.2.  Travel When the Patient is Required to Lodge Within Minutes of Hospital for Patient Safety.  In this scenario, a patient that has undergone an organ transplant or other complex medical procedure is advised by competent medical authority to remain within the  local  vicinity  of  the  treating  hospital.    The  treating  hospital  is  less  than  100  miles from the patient’s home station.  When for patient safety reasons the patient is required to lodge near to the treating hospital, the patient should be placed on medical travel orders and  accorded  travel  and  transportation  allowances.    The  MTF  Chief  of  Medical  Staff must carefully evaluate the circumstances of the patient’s condition and advise the RMO accordingly.    When  extended  stays  are  anticipated,  reasonable  and  cost-effective accommodations  within  a  Ronald  McDonald  House  or  a  Fisher  House  should  be explored.    Refer  to  AFI  41-210,  TRICARE  Operations  and  Patient  Administration Functions. 10.3.  Medical  Referral  Travel  at  the  Member’s  Expense.  Travel  to  medical  appointments within the PDS other than as described in the above paragraphs is not reimbursable. 10.4.  Medical  Referral  Travel  Outside  the  PDS.  Members  on  official  travel  orders  are authorized  travel  and  transportation  allowances  in  accordance  with  the  JTR.    Travel  must  be authorized by proper medical authority.  (T-0). 10.5.  Medical  Referral  Travel  for  Government  Employees  Overseas  and  Their  Family Members.  When local medical facilities (military or civilian) at a foreign OCONUS area are not able to accommodate an employee’s needs, transportation to another location may be authorized for  appropriate  medical/dental  care.    Health  care  travel  expenses  are  charged  to  the  operating funds of the employee’s organization.  Travel and transportation is authorized in accordance with the JTR. 10.6.  Travel  to  Specialty  Care  Over  100  Miles.

A TDY travel authorization/order for a family member’s travel per JTR (7320) must be issued and cite JTR 7320 as authority.  (T-0). travel  under  a  competent is  authorized 10.12.  Retirees  with  a  Combat-related  Disability  who  are  not  Enrolled  in  TRICARE Prime.  When a retired member with a combat-related disability, who is not a TRICARE Prime enrollee,  is  referred  by  a  primary  care  provider  for  follow-on  specialty  care,  services  and supplies, for that particular disability, more than 100 miles from where the member resides, the patient  must  be  reimbursed  for  reasonable  travel  expenses.    Note:  The  TRICARE  Regional Office located in the region where the retiree resides determines if the specialty care is more than 100 miles from the retiree’s residence.  Transportation expenses are reimbursed for the official distance from the patient’s residence city to the specialty care provider’s city.  This also applies to subsequent specialty referrals authorized by a primary care provider.  This policy is based on ASD/Health Affairs, TRICARE Management Activity/Health Plan Operations memo of 14 July 2009 and USD(P&R) memo of 31 August 2009. 10.12.1.  Applicability.    Retirees  using  TRICARE  Standard,  Extra  or  TRICARE  For  Life (TFL) who must travel to obtain specialty care for a combat-related disability.

The Air Force provides round-trip  transportation  and  Per  Diem  (not  DHP-funded)  in  accordance  with  the  JTR  (7315)  for  not more  than  three  designated  individuals  to  the  medical  facility  of  a  member  listed  as  a  very seriously  ill/injured  (VSI)  or  seriously  ill/injured  (SI)  casualty  when  hospitalized  in  or  outside the  United  States,  if  the  attending  physician  or  surgeon  and  the  commander  or  head  of  the military  treatment  facility  exercising  military  control  over  the  member  determine  that  the presence  of  the  designated  individual  may  contribute  to  the member’s  health  and  welfare  for  a period  of  up  to  30  days  (37  USC  §481h).    In  addition,  Per  AFI  36-3002,  Casualty  Services, EFMT  applies  to  members  who  are  deployed  on  OEF/OND  CED  orders  and  who  are hospitalized and have been placed in a Hostile Not Seriously Ill/Injured (NSI) casualty status. 10.14.1.  Eligibility.    The  EFMT  program  applies  to  designated  individuals  of  a  military member serving on active duty to include ANG and USAFR members in a duty status. 10.14.2.  AF  EFMT  Program  Office.  AFPC  Casualty  Services  Branch  (AFPC/DPWCS) oversees all aspects of the EFMT Program on behalf of the AFPC Commander (AFPC/CC) and  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SecAF).  AFPC/DPWCS  funds  all  EFMT  orders, amendments, advance payment and corresponding vouchers. DHP appropriation will not be cited for this program per law.  (T-0).    64  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 10.14.3.  Expenses  Covered.    Per  AFI  36-3002,  the  Air  Force  reimburses  the  designated individuals for cost of travel between their residence and the location of the MTF in which the  member  is  hospitalized  and  for  personally  procured  commercial  transportation  such  as airfare  or  driving  expenses  for  travel  by  privately  owned  vehicle  (POV).  Rental  car reimbursement is not authorized.  If Next of Kin (NOK) are already at the member’s bedside, the  Air  Force  does  not  offer  transportation  to  designated  individuals  unless  the  attending physician determines that these NOK are physically or mentally incapacitated and are unable to  contribute  to  the  member’s  health  and  welfare.    Local  per  diem  is  authorized  to  pay  for expenses such as food while in the vicinity of the medical facility.  Advance payments of per diem are authorized. 10.14.4.  Initiating  the  EFMT  Process.    Base  Casualty  Affairs  Representatives  (CARs)  will coordinate with MTFs to request EFMT via the EFMT worksheet (sample provided below).  The at AFPC.casualty@us.af.mil. completed  worksheet  will to  AFPC/DPWCS be forwarded 10.14.4.1.  Once  approved,  AFPC/DPWCS  forwards  the  request  to  the  59th  Medical Wing’s (59 MDW) Patient Travel Office to load in DTS, contact the traveler to schedule travel, and process the order.  Instead of receiving orders from AFPC/DPWCS, the CAR and traveler will receive orders from 59 MDW (who will process EFMT orders for all AF organizations  per  Memorandum  of  Agreement  between  AFPC/CC,  AF/SG,  and  59 MDW/CC, dated Oct 2011). 10.14.4.2.  Once  travel  is  complete,  the  traveler  will  send  all  receipts  and  travel documents to 59 MDW to create a voucher in DTS.  AFPC/DPWCS remains the office of primary  responsibility  for  the  EFMT  program  and  all  questions  should  be  addressed  to their office at DSN: 665-3505 or Comm:  210-565-3505. 10.14.4.3.  IMPORTANT:  MTFs and CARs will not contact the 59 MDW directly with regard  to  orders.    Any  questions  or  concerns  regarding  orders  are  required  to  be  vetted through the local CAR and then up to AFPC as appropriate. 10.14.5.  Base EFMT POC.  Base CARs are the POCs for the EFMT program.  In accordance with AFI 36-3002, para. 2.27.4.4, the CAR will process EFMT requests/extensions through the  appropriate  MTF  and  forward  approved  requests  to  AFPC/DPWCS  for  further coordination/approval.  CARs will maintain a suspense system to ensure timely submission of  extension  requests  and  forward  approved  extension  requests  to  AFPC/DPWCS  NLT  10 days prior to expiration date of previous EFMT order.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   65  Figure 10.1.  Request for Initial EFMT Format.     66  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 11 MEDICAL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS 11.1.  Medical  Reimbursements  Overview.  Medical  billing  and  collections  within  DoD  is governed  largely  by  10  USC  Chapter  55.    MTFs  will  adhere  to  DoD  6010.15-M,  Military Treatment  Facility  Uniform  Business  Office  (UBO)  Manual,  which  reflects  the  legislation established  in  Title  10,  and  further  expands  on  DoD  medical  billing  policies,  and  guidance expressed  in  this  chapter  and/or  additional  guidance  published  or  sanctioned  by  AF/SGY pertaining  to  medical  reimbursements.    (T-0).    The  DoDFMR  establishes  the  accounting treatment  of  medical  A/R.    The  MTF  RMO  serves  as  the  UBO  Compliance  Officer  and establishes procedures that are consistent with DoD 6010.15-M, Chapter 2.  (T-1). 11.2.  Accounts  Receivable  (A/R).  Medical  A/R  related  to  healthcare  and  dental  services provided to patients is one of the largest assets of any institutional healthcare provider.  There are a  number  of  characteristics  unique  to  the  A/R  of  healthcare  organizations,  and  there  are significant variations in the way receivables are handled within the DoD.  This chapter highlights some  of  the  policies  and  business  practices  for  MTF  Medical  Services  Account  (MSA),  Third Party  Collections  (TPC),  and  Medical  Affirmative  Claims  (MAC)  activities.    MTF  UBO personnel must reference the UBO Manual, along with other reference materials provided by the DHA, AF/SGY and AFMOA/SGAR.(T-1). 11.3.  A/R  Requirement.  The  collection  of  receivables  must  be  aggressively  pursued  for amounts  due  from  other  DoD  components,  Federal  agencies,  and  the  public  (pay  patients  and health insurance companies).  The due date for a receivable is 30 days from the date of invoice (notice of payment due).(T-1). 11.3.1.  Erroneous,  Invalid,  and  Unsubstantiated  A/R.    Monthly  and  during  the  Triannual Review (as required by DoD FMR Volume 3, Chapter 8), receivables must be reviewed for completeness,  accuracy,  and  supportability.(T-1).    Proper  A/R  management  is  important because  AF/SGY  relies  on  MTF  compliance  with  established  policies  and  procedures  to provide monthly certification of a consolidated A/R account balance to DFAS, DHA and the U.S.  Treasury.    Proper  management  will  ensure  MTF  UBO  staff  document  and  retain  the evidence  necessary  to  establish  an  A/R  and  enable  prompt  resolution  of  any  abnormal  or erroneous  A/R.    If  at  any  time  it  is  determined  a  debt  is  invalid  and  should  not  have  been classified as A/R, the entries that established the A/R will be reversed within the Government Billing System (GBS). 11.3.2.  Retention  of  A/R  Documentation.    MTF  RMOs  will  maintain  documentation  to support actions taken on each  account.(T-1).  This includes, but is not limited to, documents supporting: 11.3.2.1.  Establishment of the A/R. 11.3.2.2.  Due process requirements, (e.g., follow-up actions taken to collect payment on open  accounts).    This  includes  copies  of  demand  letters,  telephone  call  logs  (listing  the date  of  the  call,  name  of  the  individual  contacted,  and  a  summary  of  the  conversation), and/or any notes contained within the accounts message history. 11.3.2.3.  Research and resolution of abnormal or erroneous balances.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   67  11.3.2.4.  Reversal of erroneous entries establishing the receivable. 11.3.2.5.  Termination, write-off and close-out of the receivable. 11.3.2.6.  Installment payment plan agreements. 11.3.3.  Classification  of  A/R  in  the  Accounting  System  (Financial  Reporting).    In accordance  with  DoDFMR.  Volume  4,  Chapter  3,  Receivables,  A/R  is  classified  as  either current or delinquent.  In addition, depending on the age and payment history of the account, it can be written-off as either Currently Not Collectible (CNC) or closed-out. 11.3.3.1.  Current A/R.  Amounts due within 30 days of the bill date.  For example, if the bill date is 31 Oct 2013 and today’s date is 15 Nov 2013, then the amount is considered to be “current” because the due date of 30 Nov 2013 has not passed. 11.3.3.2.  Delinquent A/R.  Billed amounts which are not paid within 30 days of the date of  the  initial  demand.  In  the  example  provided  in  11.3.3.1.,  the  account  would  be considered delinquent on 1 Dec 2013. 11.3.3.3.  Write-off.  Refers to the accounting action that removes a delinquent A/R from the AFMS’ financial accounting records/financial statements.  When A/R is written-off, it must be classified as CNC or closed-out. 11.3.3.3.1.  Currently  Not  Collectable  (CNC).    A  category  of  A/R  that  has  been written-off,  but  is  cost-effective  to  continue  collection  efforts.    A/R  that  has  been categorized as  CNC  is  reported  by AF/SGY  on  the  Treasury  Report  on  Receivables (TROR) and is eligible for the U.S. Treasury’s cross-servicing and offset programs. 11.3.3.3.2.  Close-out of A/R.  A determination made after write-off which indicates the A/R is not collectible (e.g., returned from the U.S. Treasury uncollected or further collection action would not be economically feasible). 11.4.  MSA Program.  Reference DoD 6010.15-M, paragraph C3.2. for explicit rules pertaining to  the  appointment  of  an  MSA  Officer.    The  MSA  Officer  will  comply  with  the responsibilities  stated  in  the  UBO  Manual  Chapter  3.    MSA  activities  involve  billing  and collecting funds for medical and dental services based on a patient’s eligibility status and patient category  (PATCAT)  at  the  time  care  is  rendered.  Offices  outside  of  RMO,  such  as  Patient Administration  and  patient/clinic  check-in  clerks  have  an  important  role  in  the  MSA  Program.  For example, it is their responsibility to verify that patients are eligible for care when the patient presents their military identification card and that the patient’s information is up-to-date.  If the patient  is  not  eligible  for  care,  patient/clinic  check-in  clerks  must  ensure  that  the  patient’s registration  accurately  reflects  the  patient’s  category  in  order  to  facilitate  billing  by  the  MSA Officer. (T-0)  The majority of AF MTFs will focus on direct billing of individuals as primary-payers  (MSA  Public)  and  other  government  agencies  (MSA  Federal)  for  services  rendered  in MTFs;  however,  MSA  activities  may  involve:  DoD  beneficiaries  (including  elective  cosmetic surgery  procedures),  other  government  agencies,  DoD  civilians  and  contractors,  Non-Appropriated  Fund  (NAF)  employees,  authorized  foreign  military  members,  DoD  Dependent School  employees,  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Services  (AAFES)  employees,  Secretarial Designees,  civilian  emergency  patients,  and    other  non  DoD  beneficiary  patients  authorized  to receive treatment in MTFs.  MSA Officers must ensure all forms of payments received for MSA accounts are recorded in the same month received, and that all DD Form 1131, Cash Collection    68  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 Vouchers,  are  properly  reconciled  with  checks  and  cash  payments  received.    (T-0)    The  DD Forms 1131 must be validated by the U.S. Treasury Depository (bank) and base FM.  (T-0)  The DD Forms 1131 must be reconciled in CRIS to ensure amounts were posted accurately and to the proper  line  of  accounting  (including  the  proper  Sales  Code).    (T-0)    All  MSA  documentation must be maintained for 6 years, 3 months.  (T-0) 11.4.1.  MTF  Collections  from  an  a  la  Carte  Dining  Facility.    Per  DFAS-DE  7010.5-R, Direct,  Refund,  Reimbursement,  and  Receivable  Transactions  at  Base  Level,  June  2006, Chapter 9, collections stemming from recoupment of food costs are deposited to the Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA), 57*3500 32* 48 562 C93A 525725.”  Note:  “*” represents the last digit of the current FY. 11.4.2.  Collections  for  Meal  Surcharges,  Non-contractor  Operated  Dining  Facilities. Collections  for  surcharges  are  credited  to  the  financing  appropriation(s),  i.e.,  DHP  O&M, LAF  O&M,  and/or  MPA,  based  on  the  percentage  of  the  MTF  dining  hall’s  military  and civilian manpower authorizations. Reference AFI 65-601 V1, Chapter 10.27.2. 11.4.3.  Collections for Meal Surcharges, Contractor Operated Dining Facilities. Food service officer  surcharge  collections  are  deposited  100  percent  to  the  base  medical  service  O&M appropriation. 11.4.3.1.  Calculating Surcharge Percentages.  MTF RMOs will follow the chart below to calculate  the  appropriate  percentages  and  amounts  to  deposit  to  the  MPA  and  DHP appropriations, respectively.  (T-1). 11.4.3.2.  Percentages will be calculated with the start of each FY and remain in effect for the entire FY.  Recalculations may  be made  during the FY when significant changes in manpower  authorizations  occur  after  the  start  of  the  FY,  e.g.,  changes  in  military  and civilian/contractor  ratios greater  than 10%  borne from  manpower Authorization Change Requests.

MSA Individual Out-of-Service Debts.  Individual out-of-service debt occurs when a non-DoD beneficiary receives care in an MTF and is not receiving salary or other payments from the DoD that can be offset in order to collect the individual’s debt. 11.4.4.1.  Delinquent  MSA  Individual  Out-of  Service  Debt  of  $25  or  More  (does  not include  billing  to  other  federal  agencies).    The  UBO  staff  will  refer  valid  and  legally enforceable  delinquent  individual  out-of-service  debt  of  $25  or  more  to  the  U.S. Treasury’s FedDebt program.  (T-1).  Multiple debts to the same individual totaling $25 or more must be consolidated and referred to FedDebt as one debt package. 11.4.4.2.  Mandatory  MSA  Individual  Out-of-Service  Debt  Collection  Procedures.    The UBO  staff  is  the  office  responsible  for  initial  debt  collection  and  due  process  actions.  The UBO staff will: 11.4.4.2.1.  Issue  the  initial  bill  (demand  letter)  to  the  debtor  and  take  appropriate follow-up actions.  Only one demand letter is required. 11.4.4.2.2.  Research  and  confirm  debtors  are  not  employees  of  the  DoD  (either military  or  civil  service)  to  ensure  only  eligible,  individual  out-of-service  debts  are referred to the FedDebt program. 11.4.4.2.3.  Enter delinquent individual out-of-service debts that are $25 or greater to FedDebt.  Reference FedDebt Guide for details. 11.4.4.3.  Balance  Billing  Non-Beneficiaries.    Balances  from  unpaid  insurance  benefits will be billed to the patient with the following exceptions: 11.4.4.3.1.  Emergency care rendered to non-beneficiary Medicare patients is billed to Medicare  for  MTFs  with  appropriate  Medicare  agreements.    Non-beneficiary Medicare  patients  will  only  be  responsible  for  applicable  co-pay  and  deductible charges.  Non-emergent services provided by the MTF will be charged to the patient.     70  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 11.4.4.3.2.  Non-beneficiary  Medicaid  patients  are  only  responsible  for  paying  the charges if the patient was not covered by Medicaid at the time of the visit.  Do not bill patients for the unpaid Medicaid portion or for remaining balances if the patient was Medicaid eligible at the time service was rendered. 11.4.4.3.3.  Partial  payments  from  other  state  agency  sponsored  programs,  such  as Victims of Crime, shall be considered paid in full if the program's allowable payment is  less  than  the  billed  amount  and  payment  received  is  equal  to  the  program's allowable payment.  If the claim is denied by the state agency sponsored program for reasons  other  than  maximum  benefits  exceeded,  MTFs  will  bill  the  patient  for  the full/remaining  balance.    (*Victims  of  Crime  benefits  apply  per  incident;  therefore, maximum benefits pertain to all visits related to that incident.) 11.4.4.3.4.  VA  patients  will  not  be  billed  for  portions  not  paid  by  the  VA.    If documentary  evidence  exists  indicating  the  patient  was  instructed  to  go  to  the  MTF by the VA, do not bill the patient for these charges.  Such occurrences will be settled between  the  MTF  and  the  VA,  not  the  patient.  However,  if  procedures  are  not covered  under  VA  sharing  agreements,  bill  the  patient  as  a  civilian  emergency  for those services only. 11.4.4.3.5.  For  charges  not  billable  to  the  patient,  the  UBO  will  follow  closure procedures for inpatient and outpatient accounts. 11.4.4.4.  Delinquent  Debts  Under  $25.    If  debt  collection  efforts  for  a  delinquent  debt less than $25 are unsuccessful and the attempts to collect are fully documented within the GBS, write-off and close the debt after one (1) year from the initial bill due date.  Ensure there are no other accounts for the sponsor or other family members that, when combined together, would bring the total due to at least $25. 11.4.5.  Billing  for  Healthcare  Provided to  International  Military  Students  (IMS).  International  Military  Education  &  Training  (IMET)  Program  and  Foreign  Military  Sales (FMS) claims are billed according to the directions listed on the students’ Invitational Travel Order (ITO).  Item 12b of the ITO specifies the source of reimbursement for medical/dental costs.  If the IMS is covered under a reciprocal health care agreement between the U.S. and the IMS’ country, the agreement will take precedence.  Reciprocal agreements guidance may be (from  “.mil”  addresses  only): https://rhca.dhhq.health.mil.    There  are  a  few  exceptions  to  this  rule  that  must  be  billed differently; however, specific instructions will also be reflected on the ITO. the  Security  Assistance  website found  at 11.4.5.1.  Eligibility for healthcare in MTFs is outlined in AFI 41-210.  While the basic entitlement for medical care for IMET and FMS personnel is the same as for U.S. Active Duty military members, any differences are detailed in AFI 41-210. 11.4.5.2.  Information  on  the rates  and  charges  for  IMS  patients  and  their  dependents  is located in the annual Medical and Dental Rates package located on the DHA UBO web site:  http://www.tricare.mil/ocfo/mcfs/ubo/index.cfm. 11.4.5.3.  AF  MTFs  will  be  reimbursed  for  medical  services  provided  to  students sponsored by another U.S. government agency.  These students are sometimes provided a sickness  and  accident  insurance  policy  by  the  sponsoring  agency  to  defray  all  medical expenses, which needs to be billed in the same manner as other OHI.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   71  11.4.5.4.  When the student is not covered by insurance, reimbursement will be provided locally  by  the  student  or  claims  will  be  forwarded  to  the  Air  Force  Security  Assistance Training  Program  (AFSAT)  office  at  Randolph  AFB  for  reimbursement  from  the sponsoring agency, as determined by the ITO. 11.4.5.4.1.  When claims are sent to AFSAT, each package requires an SF 1080 and a signed  DD7  or  DD7A  report.    The  SF1080  will  summarize  the  DD7/7A  report, whereas the DD7 or DD7A report will generally be a list of many patients by patient category.  DO NOT send Invoice & Receipts (I&Rs). 11.4.5.4.2.  In  order  to  allow  for  segregation  of  duties,  the  DD7  or  DD7A  report preparer  must  be  different  from  the  individual  who  reviews  and  signs  the  report(s) and SF 1080 to validate medical services were provided and the charges are accurate.  Preferably,  there  should  be  one  report  each,  per  month  for  outpatient,  inpatient  and dental claims. 11.4.5.4.2.1.  Identify  specific  bill  number  on  each  SF  1080.    Use  the  same  bill number  annotated  on  the  corresponding  DD7  or  DD7A  report  (these  need  to match). 11.4.5.4.2.2.  Dental claims must be created manually from a blank DD7A report. 11.4.5.4.3.  Elective  and  Definitive  Surgery.    HA  Policy  05-020  states  cosmetic surgery  procedures  will  be  restricted  to  TRICARE-eligible  beneficiaries.    Elective medical,  surgical,  or  dental  care  is  defined  as  care  desired  or  requested  by  the individual  or  recommended  by  the  physician  or  dentist  which,  in  the  opinion  of professional authority, can be performed at another time or place without jeopardizing the health or well-being of the patient.  Overall, elective and definitive surgery should be  authorized  in  moderation,  except  for  bona  fide  emergency  situations.    Do  not imply  to  an  IMS  that  U.S.  DoD  medical  activities  will  be  available  for  cosmetic  or remedial  surgery.    However,  in  the  rare  instance  when  elective  medical  care  is considered necessary, complete facts surrounding the case will need to be transmitted by message to HQ USAF WASH DC //SGPC// for prior approval. 11.4.6.  Interagency  Medical  Billing.    Title  10  USC  §1085  states  that  when  the  medical facilities  of  one  Executive  Department  provide  healthcare  to  beneficiaries  of  another Executive  Department,  the  Executive  Department  whose  beneficiaries  receive  the  care  will reimburse the other for the care provided at rates reflecting the average cost of providing the care.  Those established rates are known as interagency reimbursement rates.  The rates are published annually by the DoD and detail all billable charges.  The latest rates may be found at:  http://www.tricare.mil/ocfo/mcfs/ubo/billing.cfm 11.4.6.1.  Interagency  billing  for  AF  MTFs  primarily  involves  billing  the  U.S.  Coast Guard,  the  U.S.  Public  Health  Service  (USPHS),  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human Services  (Public  Health),  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA), Veterans Affairs (VA) and some Foreign Military.  Billing is conducted at the inter-agency rate (IAR), a reduced rate as compared to the full outpatient rate (FOR) or full reimbursement rate (FRR). 11.4.6.2.  USPHS Centralized Billing and Collection Procedure.  In order to expedite the receipt of payments from the USPHS, AF/SGY bills the USPHS on behalf of the MTFs.     72  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 Collections  are  deposited  into  the  MTFs’  line  of  accounting  and  MTF  RMOs  are responsible for reconciling payments received against the information in CRIS. 11.4.6.3.  U.S. Coast Guard Centralized Billing and Collection Procedure.  In FY14, the AFMS  adopted  a  revised  version  of  the  DHA’s  prospective  payment  methodology  for billing  the  Coast  Guard.    Similar  to  USPHS  billing,  AF/SGY  will  coordinate reimbursement  for  services  provided  to  the  Coast  Guard  on  behalf  of  the  MTFs. Collections  are  deposited  into  the  MTFs’  line  of  accounting  and  MTF  RMOs  are responsible for reconciling payments received against the information in CRIS. 11.5.  TPC  Program.  The  TPC  program  was  established  by  Public  Law  101-510  (10  USC §1095).  The program directs military hospitals to bill insurance companies for the cost of care provided  to  DoD  beneficiaries  by  the  military  facility.    Specifically,  when  a  non-active  duty beneficiary is seen for medical care within the MTF, the Government must query and document whether that patient possesses other health insurance (OHI) by completing the DD Form 2569, Third  Party  Collection  Program  –  Insurance  Information  Sheet  (2569).    The  TPC  Clerk  will comply with the UBO Manual Chapter 4.  (T-0). 11.5.1.  OHI  Identification  and  OHI  Database  Maintenance.    The  MTF  commander  is responsible  for  establishment  and  sustainment  of  the  MTF’s  TPC  program.    MTF commanders must ensure full compliance with the OHI collection mandate as directed by 10 USC §1095, 32 CFR 220, and DoD 6010.15-M.  Since insured status may change since the patient’s last visit to the MTF, all non-active duty patients must be asked whether they have OHI and check-in staff must validate that the patient’s DD Form 2569 is current (completed within  the  last  year).    This  form  will  be  solicited  from  non-active  duty  patients  at  all  MTF patient check-in points, to include ancillary and clinical areas, and must be updated annually or  when  changes  in  health  insurance  coverage  occur.  All  non-active  duty  patients  are required to complete a DD Form 2569 annually.  (T-0). 11.5.1.1.  In  accordance  with  32  CFR  220.9,  (c),  beneficiaries  are  required  to  provide correct  information  to  the  MTF  regarding  whether  the  beneficiary  is  covered  by  a  third party payer’s plan.  Intentionally providing false information or willfully failing to satisfy a beneficiary’s obligations are grounds for disqualification for health care services from the uniformed services. 11.5.1.2.  To  facilitate  expeditious  collection  and  documentation  of  OHI,  the  AFMS adopted an electronic version of the DD Form 2569 (e-2569). 11.5.1.3.  OHI  collected  via  the  e-2569  will  populate  an  MHS-wide  database  that alleviates unnecessary queries for beneficiaries as they transfer from one MTF to another.  Direct entry of OHI information into the database expedites the collection process.  Note:  Use of the paper-based 2569 is authorized only when the MTF commander determines no other means of electronic capture are feasible.  In those rare instances, the MTF staff is responsible  for  entering  all  information  collected  on  the  paper-based  2569  into  the electronic database.  The MTF commander shall ensure the information is electronically documented  in  the  database  within  48  hours  of  discovery  to  enable  timely  billing  and collection activities.  (T-1).  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   73  11.5.1.3.1.  RMO  must  collaborate  with  Patient  Administration  and  clinic  check-in clerks  to  ensure  that  clerks  verify  that  patients  are  eligible  for  care,  and  that  patient information is kept up-to-date.  (T-1). 11.5.1.3.2.  Without  exception,  all  check-in  clerks  must  query  patients  on  whether they have OHI and record or update the patient’s OHI information. (T-0). 11.5.2.  AFMS  TPC  Billing  and  Collection  Contract.    The  TPC  contract  is  designed  to provide  billing  and  collection  services  from  third  party  insurers  for  treatment  provided  in MTFs.    Billing  and  collection  activities  in  the  contract  include:    identification  and verification of all billable OHI, identification of episodes of care for patients carrying OHI, direct  billing  of  third  party  payers,  ongoing  follow-up  actions  for  unpaid  claims  to  include denials  management  processes,  payment  posting,  conducting  valid  write-offs  per  AFMS business rules, and referral of delinquent claims per AFMS business rules.  The contract does not  include  first  party  billing  to  beneficiaries,  interagency  billing,  billing  for  cosmetic procedures, copying charges, or incidental charges (family member rate) for inpatient stays.  Any unresolved issues should be reported to the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) at AF/SGY as soon as possible. 11.5.2.1.  The  government  TPC  Clerk  must  reconcile  write-offs  and  payments  received with Explanation of Benefits (EOBs) and amounts posted in the billing system.  Note:  In the  absence  of  the  MTF’s  access  to  the  billing  system,  the  TPC  Clerk  will  reconcile EOBs to the batch reports received from the TPC Contractor.  Ensure TPC collections are properly posted to the correct line of accounting (including Sales Code).  (T-0). 11.5.2.2.  The  RMO  must  ensure  DD  Forms  1131,  Cash  Collection  Vouchers,  are reconciled with CRIS reports on a monthly basis (minimum).  DD Forms 1131 must be validated by the U.S. Treasury Depository (bank)  and the base  FM.  RMO  must  ensure SF  215’s  are  supported  by  DD  Forms  1131  (annotate  the  DOV  Voucher  numbers  from the DD Form 1131 onto the SF 215). (T-0). 11.5.3.  Processing  TPC  Inpatient  and  Outpatient  Refunds.    The  MTF  is  responsible  for verifying refunds are valid and completing the process in a timely manner.  (T-0). 11.5.3.1.  Process  refunds  as  soon  as  possible  but  no  later  than  the end  of  every  month.  Failure to do so may result in an insurance company refusing to pay other claims until a refund is received. 11.5.3.2. Inpatient and Outpatient refunds are generated from several sources.  Table 11.2. provides a list of refund sources and the processes to follow. 11.5.4.  TPC – Medical Insurance Carrier Debt Older than 180 Days.  Per DoDFMR Vol 4, Chap 3, para 030405(E), valid and legally enforceable delinquent public receivables over 180 days delinquent must be transferred to the U.S. Treasury via the FedDebt program for further collection action in accordance with 31 USC §3711(g), except for foreign government debts or those debts/claims that are in litigation.  (T-0). 11.5.4.1.  Payments  Received  after  Debts  are  Transferred  to  the  U.S.  Treasury.    Should the  MTF  receive  reimbursement  on  a  debt  after  the  package  is  transferred  via  the FedDebt program to the U.S. Treasury, the MTF is not authorized to deposit the payment.  The  MTF  will  mail  the  payment  to  the  U.S.  Treasury  along  with  a  memo  that  includes sufficient  information  to  ensure  the  U.S.  Treasury  is  able  to  credit  the  payment  to  the    74  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 debtor’s account.  The MTF UBO will accomplish this action with 48 hours of payment receipt.  (T-1). 11.6.  MAC  Program.  The MAC Clerk will comply with responsibilities set forth in the UBO Manual Chapter 5.  MAC activities involve billing all areas of liability (tort) insurance, such as automobile, products, premises and general casualty, homeowner’s, renter’s, medical malpractice (by  civilian  providers),  and  workers’  compensation  (other  than  Federal  employees).    It  also includes  billing  the  medical  coverage  portion  on  homeowner’s  and  auto  policies,  and  the personal  injury  protection  coverage  on  no-fault  auto  policies.    MAC  program  billing  includes care provided to Active Duty, retirees, and their dependents. A quarterly reconciliation of claims is required IAW DODI 6010.15.  This reconciliation is accomplished by the MAC clerk with the regional  Medical  Cost  Recovery  Program  (MCRP)  or  local  SJA  and  approved  by  the  RMO Flight Commander. 11.6.1.  Responsibilities. 11.6.1.1.  MAC Clerk duties: 11.6.1.1.1.  Train  MTF  staff  during  in-processing,  quarterly  and  as  needed  on procedures to identify potential MAC-related encounters and information required. 11.6.1.1.2.

In coordination with the Budget Analyst conduct a monthly reconciliation of  MAC  cases  to  ensure  audit  of  deposits  and  receipts  match  closed  cases;  that  all MAC are collected to the correct line of accounting and fiscal year; and that the DD Forms 1131 are reconciled in CRIS. 11.6.1.1.9.  Complete  quarterly  MAC the  MCRP  of open/transferred/  closed  cases  to  resolve  any  discrepancies.    Forward  reconciliation package to the MTF commander for review and signature. reconciliation  with 11.6.1.2.  MCRP Office Overview.  The MCRP regions and the MTFs serviced by each MCRP  Office.    In  support  of  the  MTF’s  MAC  program,  the  MCRP  reviews  1488s; identifies  and  pursues  potential  MAC  cases;  conducts  follow-up  actions;  deposits  funds collected to the MTF’s line of accounting; provides a copy of the DD Form 1131 to the MTF MAC Clerk; and conducts reconciliation of open/transferred/closed cases with the MAC Clerk.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   75  11.7.  Over-the-Counter  Network  (OTCnet)  Deposit  Requirement.  The  U.S.  Treasury requires all federal agencies  incorporate electronic commerce for all  financial  transactions.   To that end, they established OTCnet to enable every government agency to electronically process and  submit  their  deposits  utilizing  OTCnet.    AF  MTFs  are  required  to  process  all  deposits through  OTCnet.  Any  system  or  other  issues  that  remain  unresolved  after  working  with  the OTCnet helpdesk shall be elevated to AFMOA/SGAR or AF/SGY, as appropriate.  (T-0). 11.8.  Mandatory Actions when Depositing Collections.  (T-1). 11.8.1.  Mandatory  Secondary  Review  of  all  Deposits  and  Refunds  Prior  to  Processing.    In order to mitigate errors and reduce the number of Journal Vouchers prepared to correct those errors, all deposit documentation must be reviewed prior to submission to the bank or Base Accounting and Finance Office (BAFO). 11.8.1.1.  The review must validate the lines of accounting, sales codes, and amounts to be  deposited  are  accurate.    Procedures  for  conducting  the  review  will  be  developed locally. 11.8.1.2.  The same person making the deposit cannot also conduct the secondary review. 11.8.1.3.  If documentation is accurate, the reviewer must initial all documents (e.g., DD Form  1131s)  in  the  upper  left  hand  corner.    However,  if  errors  are  found,  the  reviewer will not initial the documents, but will return the documents to the originator (e.g., MSA or TPC Officer) for correction. 11.8.2.  Annotations on SF 215 (deposit ticket receipt).  (T-1). 11.8.2.1.  For internal control validation and audit purposes, upon making a TPC, MAC, or  MSA  deposit,  RMO  staff  must  clearly  annotate  all  DD  Form  1131  DOV  voucher numbers on the SF 215. 11.8.2.2.  File  the  SF  215  with  the  certified  copies  of  the  supporting  DD  Forms  1131s from the BAFO. 11.8.3.  Deposit  Requirements  for  MSA,  TPC  and  MAC  (reference  DoDFMR  Vol  5,  Chap 3). 11.8.3.1.  Frequency.    The  deposit  of  all  cash  and  negotiable  instruments  (Personal Checks,  traveler  checks,  money  orders)  received  shall  be  made  without  delay  when receipts reach local safe requirements but not to exceed the $5,000 limit.    (T-1).  When the  total  is  less  than  $5,000,  the  receipts  may  be  accumulated  and  deposited  when  the total  reaches  $5,000.  However,  deposits  shall  be  made  by  Thursday  of  each  week, regardless of the amount accumulated.  (T-3). 11.8.3.2.  Exceptions to Frequency.  Deposits will be made in a timely manner and posted in the GBS throughout the FY.  MTF UBO staff shall not hold onto deposits beyond the requirements in paragraph 11.8.3.1 unless it is near the end of the FY, in which case the following applies: 11.8.3.2.1.  In an effort to ensure all funds are posted and deposited in the same FY, MTF  UBO  staff  shall  send  their  last  batch  to  the  TPC  billing  contractor  NLT  7 business  days  before  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  (EOFY).    Ensure  batch  reports  are received from the contractor and deposits are made by EOFY.    76  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 11.8.3.2.2.  If the local BAFO has set the cut-off for deposits earlier than 7 business days  before  EOFY,  adjust  local  schedules  accordingly.    MTF  UBO  staff  and contractors  must  determine  if  additional  batches  can  be  posted  and  reconciled  so deposits can be made before the EOFY. 11.8.3.2.3.  Any checks received after the stated deadline should be batched and sent to the contractor with a note that states, “Do not post until 1 Oct.”  This will allow the contractors the opportunity to look up account numbers and have the batches ready to post. 11.8.4.  Mandatory  Monthly  Reconciliation  of  Deposits.    Following  the  End  of  Month (EOM)  and  no  later  than  the  10th  duty  day,  the  Budget  Analyst  (or  party  other  than MSA/TPC  Officer  and  Cashier  personnel)  will  conduct  an internal  audit  of  all reimbursements  and  deposits  stemming  from  MSA,  TPC  and  MAC.    The  audit  will  be documented  on  the  Monthly  Audit  of  Deposits  &  Refunds  Form  (provided  at  Figure  11.1).  (T-1). 11.8.4.1.  The Budget Analyst will: 11.8.4.1.1.  Run  a  STH  from  CRIS  that  reflects  all  reimbursement  deposits  for  the previous month (include DOV voucher numbers, sales code, OAC, OBAN, amounts, and date of transaction in the query criteria). 11.8.4.1.2.  Provide  the  reviewing  official  with  a  copy  of  the  Monthly  Audit  of Deposits & Refunds Form. 11.8.4.1.3.  Ensure the MSA/TPC/MAC Officers provide the required documents for the audit. 11.8.4.2.  Documents to be Audited: 11.8.4.2.1.  The  MSA/TPC  Officer  will  provide  all  SF  215s  with  corresponding  DD Form 1131s deposited during the previous month to the appointed reviewing official. 11.8.4.2.2.  The  MSA  Officer  will  provide  bills  submitted  to  other  federal  agencies (paid via IPAC). 11.8.4.2.3.  The  MAC  Officer  will  provide  copies  of  the  DD  Form  1131s  received from the Legal Office 11.8.4.3.  The Reviewing Official Will: 11.8.4.3.1.  Obtain a copy of the CRIS STH report from the Budget Analyst (not the MSA/TPC/MAC Officer). 11.8.4.3.2.  Cross-reference the DOV voucher number on the DD Form 1131 with the DOV  voucher  column  on  the  CRIS  STH  report.    Ensure  DOV  voucher  numbers match, and the sales code and amounts match exactly. 11.8.4.3.3.  Verify  payments  reflected  on  the  CRIS  STH  report  (posted  via  IPAC) have  supporting  documents  on  file  (interagency  billing).    Ensure  the  amount  billed and the amount received match.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   77  11.8.4.3.4.  Ascertain that all corresponding DOV vouchers are attached to the SF 215 deposit ticket.  Validate that the SF 215 has the corresponding DD Forms 1131 (DOV voucher numbers) annotated on the face or on the reverse of the SF 215. 11.8.4.3.5.  Documenting  Discrepancies.    If  any  inaccuracies  are  noted,  provide  a description of the discrepancy on the Monthly Audit of Deposits & Refunds Form. 11.8.4.3.6.  Certify the Review.  The reviewing official will provide a signed copy of the completed review form to the Budget Analyst. 11.8.4.4.  Finalizing the Audit. 11.8.4.4.1.  The Budget Analyst will complete the section labeled “Actions Taken to Correct Discrepancies,” to include processing journal vouchers. 11.8.4.4.2.  Provide  the  completed  form  to  the  MTF  RMO  Flight  Commander  for review and signature. 11.8.4.4.3.  The Budget Analyst will maintain the original copy of the form on file for one (1) fiscal year. 11.8.4.4.4.  The  MSA/TPC/MAC  Officer  must  retain  a  signed  copy  on  file  with  the source documents in accordance with records disposition rules (6 years, 3 months). 11.9.  Deposits  Stemming  from  DCMO  Out-of-Service  Debt  Collections.  Any  collections stemming from DCMO out-of-service debt collection efforts will be deposited to the originating MTF’s Line of Accounting (EEIC 599M1). 11.9.1.  DFAS  will  notify  MTFs  when  collections  are  deposited  and  the  appropriate  patient account for which the reimbursement should be credited. 11.9.2.  Partial payments must be posted to the patient’s account (e.g., take the account out of “T” status, post the payment, and return the account to “T” status). 11.10.  Overseas  Pay  Patients.  Certain  categories  of  non-DoD  beneficiaries  are  authorized  to receive care at overseas MTFs in accordance with DoD 6010.15-M.  Non-billable visits are listed in DoD 6010.15-M, C6.6.7. 11.10.1.  Overseas  Patients  with  OHI.    MTF  UBO  staff  will  scan  and  upload  bills,  coding information (obtained from CHCS), and most current 2569 to the TPC contractor’s document transfer program. 11.10.2.  Overseas Patients without OHI.  Mail bills for patients without OHI to the patient or patient’s sponsor.  If you do not have a completed and current 2569 on file, send one with the bill.    In  addition,  include  a  letter  advising  the  patient  the  MTF  may  bill  their  insurance.   Note:    Ensure  ALL  bills  include  ancillary  services,  ambulance  and  dental  care,  as  well  as immunizations  that  are  not  included  in  the  CHCS  bills.    Some  of  these  charges  need  to  be manually created. 11.10.2.1.  Insurance companies are billed at the full outpatient rate. 11.10.2.2.  Patients are billed at the interagency rate.

Sales  codes  are  used  to  reflect  the  sources  from  which  collections  are derived,  which  is  necessary  in  order  to  comply  with  Federal  financial  reporting  requirements.  Incorrect sales codes or failure to identify sales codes results in erroneous data being reflected on AFMS  financial statements, and may lead to  strategic decisions  based on incorrect data.  MTF UBOs  must  ensure  they  use  the  proper  EEIC  and  sales  code  on  all  reimbursements  collected.  Refer to Table 11.4 for authorized sales codes.  (T-1). 11.12.  Establishing  Payment  Installment  Plans.  In  accordance  with  DoDFMR  Volume  5 Chapter  28,  debtors  shall  be  afforded  the  opportunity  to  enter  into  payment  installment agreements with the MTF as follows: 11.12.1.  Installment  Timing  and  Amount.    Debtors  shall  make  installment  payments  on  a monthly  basis.    Installment  payments  shall  bear  a  reasonable  relationship  to  the  size  of  the debt  and the debtor’s ability to  pay.  Except when a debtor can  prove financial  hardship  or another reasonable  cause  exists,  installment  payments  shall  be  at  least  $50  each  month  and shall be sufficient to liquidate a debt within 3 years or less.  (T-0). 11.12.2.  Installment  Payment  Agreement. legally  enforceable  repayment agreements  from  the  debtor  shall  specify  the  terms  agreed  upon  by  the  parties,  including  a provision  accelerating  the  debt,  and  requiring  the  remaining  debt  balance  shall  be  due  and payable  immediately  upon  the  debtor’s  default  on  the  agreement.    UBO  staff  shall  accept installment payments, notwithstanding a debtor’s refusal to execute a written agreement or to provide security.  (T-0).   Signed, 11.12.3.  Installment Payment Delinquency.  Debts in an active repayment status (according to  an  installment  payment  agreement)  are  not  considered  delinquent.  If  an  installment payment is not made by the due date, then the entire balance of the debt becomes delinquent from the due date of the missed payment. Table 11.2.

General.  The  Air  Force  Medical  Service  is  committed  to  maintaining  the  professional competence  of  Air  Force  officers  who  provide health  care services.  Officers  are  encouraged  to continue  their  professional  development  through  Continuing  Medical  Education  (CME).  Every effort should be made to maximize distance learning resources, as well as local resources. All  licensed  personnel  and  privileged  providers  must  meet  the  requirements  IAW  AFI  44-119, Medical  Quality  Operations.  Non-licensed  medical  service  officers  who  are  affiliated  with civilian  professional  organizations  should  meet those  organizational  CME  requirements.   Refer to  AFI  41-117,  Medical  Service  Officer  Education,  for  more  information  on  the  diverse education programs and associated requirements. 12.2.  CME  Programs.  CME  programs  are  short  term  courses  or  education  programs  that maintain  professional  and  technical  knowledge  or  teach  additional  skills  that  are  used  by  the USAF  Medical  Service.  These  programs  are  intended  to  refresh  officers  in  various  aspects  of their professional  discipline and inform them of  new developments and techniques within their field. The Air Force has a strong commitment to CME in order to prepare competent personnel for the delivery of excellent patient care. Programs are conducted by USAF/SG, major command surgeons, USAF schools, MTFs, and civilian organizations. 12.2.1.  Commander  Responsibility.  Air  Force  commanders  help  personnel  to  meet  their individual CME requirements within the restraints of current resources. Commanders may, if funds  and  staffing  permit,  allow  medical  service  personnel  to  attend  an  approved  CME program in a funded status on temporary duty. Individuals approved for locally funded TDY should  have  one  year  of  retainability  in  the  Medical  Service.  Commanders  may  approve individuals with  less  than  one  year  retainability  if  attendance  serves  the  best  interest  of  the organization and the Air Force. In the absence of Air Force funds to sponsor a member for attendance at an approved CME activity, the commander may allow the individual to attend such programs in a permissive TDY status (IAW AFI 36-3003). 12.2.2.  Sources of CME.   Members wanting to participate in  CME activities can turn  to a number of sources. However, only one funded TDY (funded from any source) is authorized each fiscal year, depending on the availability of funds, and mission requirements. Requests for  multiple  TDYs  in  one  fiscal  year  should  be  considered  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  CME courses  may  include:  formal  Air  Force  courses  or  AFIT-sponsored  educational  courses  as described in Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCAs) and special programs developed  and  presented  by  HQ  USAF,  MAJCOMs,  or  combined  Air  Force  and  DoD agencies  or  organizations.  Commanders  should  consider  the  availability  of  locally developed, web-based or procured CME before approving a request for a unit-funded TDY. 12.2.3.  Unit-Funded TDY. Commanders may use DHP O&M funds to finance attendance at approved  CME  programs  offered  by  civilian  institutions  and  agencies,  or  to  attend  other government-sponsored CME.  All travel for CME attendance must be approved and directed by an authorized supervisor.(T-0).    84  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 12.2.3.1.  Use funds for this purpose only if such programs serve the best interest of the Air Force. 12.2.3.2.  An  accrediting  national  professional  organization  should  be  selected  and  the course  should  award  participants  at  least  6  hours  of  continuing  education  credit  per day. 12.2.3.3.  Individuals  approved  for  locally  funded  TDY  must  have  the  required retainability in the Medical Service. (IAW AFI 36-3003).  (T-1) 12.2.3.4.  All TDY requests must be accompanied by a completed SF 182, Authorization, Agreement  and  Certification  of  Training.    The  SF  182  should  be  filed  by  the  unit Education and Training Manager, and uploaded to the Defense Travel System as part of substantiating  documentation.    If  a  portion  of  the  TDY  is  funded  with  the  Government Purchase Card, the cardholder will retain a copy of the SF182 along with the receipt as supporting documentation for the expense.  (T-1). 12.2.3.5.  All training for civilian employees MUST be ESP-coded “MA.” 12.2.3.6.  Training/Certification Fees.  MTFs should fund training/certification fees with a  GPC  that  is  designated  for  training  expenses  only.    If  the  member  has  used  personal funds  to  pay  for  approved  training/certification  fees,  then  reimbursement  will  be  made via a Standard Form (SF) 1164, Claim  for Reimbursement for Expenditures  on Official Business, voucher. 12.2.3.6.1.  Individuals must attach relevant receipts with a copy of the commander’s approval  for  reimbursement  letter,  and  proof  of  successful  completion  of  the examination to the SF 1164 voucher.  The voucher must be routed through the MTF RMO/unit resource advisor in order to obtain the proper fund cite, and submitted to the base Finance Office for payment.  (T-1). 12.2.3.6.2.  In  order  to  properly  record  costs  in  the  accounting  system,  individuals that  traveled  TDY  will  omit  the  training-related/certification  fees  from  DTS  and claim those costs separately on the SF 1164.  Do not claim training/certification fees on the DTS travel voucher since it would result in the fee being assigned an EEIC 409 instead of an EEIC 558XX. 12.2.4.  Permissive  TDY.  An  individual  may  attend  a  military  or  civilian-sponsored  CME program in permissive TDY status, provided CME credit is awarded (minimum should be 6 CME credits per day). They must pay for their own travel expenses, registration fees, tuition, and other expenses.  (T-1). 12.2.4.1.  The local medical facility commander may approve permissive TDY of fewer than 30 days for CME, depending on the needs of the facility. Do not approve permissive TDY in conjunction with a PCS to enter an AFIT-sponsored graduate education program if the courses are a required part of the curriculum of the training program the officer is about to enter. 12.2.4.2.  The MAJCOM is responsible for approving permissive TDYs of 30 to 90 days. 12.2.4.3.  The  MAJCOM  recommends  permissive  TDYs  of  more  than  90  days; AFPC/DPAM is responsible for approval.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   85  12.2.5.  Eligibility.      Participants  in  CME  courses  must  meet  the  entrance  requirements  or have  the  professional  qualifications  necessary  to  benefit  from  the  material  presented. Participants  must  also  have  the  appropriate  retainability.  Commanders  must  ensure  that individuals have retainability before funding the TDY. 12.3.  EEIC to Charge.  EEIC558XX – Education & Training Costs.  See the below table for a list of commonly used EEIC pertaining to Education & Training expenses. Table 12.1.  Education & Training EEICs.  EEIC Description 55801 Other Svcs - Prof Cred - Continuing Education of Health Providers: Tuition for the professional continuing education of employees (e.g., for obtaining and maintaining professional competencies, certifications and professional licensing for medical health care provider personnel). Note:  Use this EEIC when PROVIDER STAFF (physicians, dentists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dental hygienists) request reimbursement for fees paid associated with CME, e.g., if not already included with TDY costs. 55802 Other Svcs - Prof Cred - Organization Dues: Air Force organizations may use O&M funds to pay membership fees in professional organizations only in the name of the Air Force organization and only if the membership will benefit the organization’s mission.  55803 Other Svcs - Prof Cred - Health Personnel Exam Fees: Obligations to support payment of health professional examination fees required to support the professional credentials of Air Force members working in the health care activities.  Note:  Use this EEIC when non-providers (BSCs, MSCs, nurses (non-nurse practitioners), other personnel) request reimbursement for fees paid associated with CME, e.g., if not already included with TDY costs. 55805 Other Svcs - Prof Cred - Hospital Accreditation: Obligations in support of hospital and medical activities to accomplish and maintain hospital accreditations of Air Force health facilities.  55806 Other Svcs - Prof Cred - Other Medical Registration Fees: Obligations to support registration of health care professional to attend professional credential and continuing education of health care providers not otherwise categorized in the EEICs 55801 through 55805.  Note:  Use only when MTF pays with GPC, e.g., if Educ & Training or Medical Logistics maintains a GPC to pay for    86  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 registration fees associated with CME TDYs. 55807 Other Svcs - Prof Cred - Prof Licenses and Certifications: CompGen Decision B-252467, June 3, 1994, allows the Air Force to pay for licenses and certificates for military personnel in instances where Federal law compels Air Force members to comply with state and local regulations requiring the licenses or certificates. Note:  Use for dental hygienists license renewal fees.  Also use for other providers ONLY when required to obtain additional license/ certification, i.e., when state does not recognize license portability and ONLY upon approved by supporting Medical Law Consultant (e.g., MLC must determine why portability is not recognized). 5580A Other Svcs - Prof Cred - Other Medical Fees: Obligations for medical fees and/or materials to maintain professional credentials not otherwise categorized.   12.4.  Civilian  Employees.  The  Employee  Development  Manager  (EDM)  within  the  local Central  Civilian  Personnel  Office  (CCPO)  normally  manages  and  funds  TDY  to  USAF  formal schools  or  other  training,  per  AFI  36-401,  Employee  Training  and  Development.  AFI  36-401 addresses the Civilian Tuition Assistance Program (CTAP), Civilian Academic Degree Payments (CADP) and Long-Term Full Time Training (LTFT). 12.4.1.  LAF-Funded Programs. 12.4.1.1.  CTAP.  Applies  to  the  courses  that  employees  desire  to  attend  for  their  self-development at accredited institutions of their choice on a voluntary basis, regardless of funding  source.  The  EDM  centrally  budget  and manage  training  funds  for  CTAP  based on funds availability. CTAP is funded under Civilian Training (PEC 88751). 12.4.1.2.  CADP.  Entails  payments  for  tuition  costs  leading  to  a  Master’s  degree  or higher,  to  address  current  and/or  future  corporate  workforce  shaping  and  development strategies  and  goals  (i.e.,  recruitment  and  retention).  This  is  not  a  program  to  satisfy training requirements. The EDM centrally budgets and manages training funds for CTAP based on funds availability. CADP is funded under Civilian Training (PEC 88751). 12.4.1.3.  LTFT.  Involves  normal  mission-related  technical  training  at  an  academic institution lasting more than 120 consecutive days. It must meet validated management-identified  training  requirement,  not  an  education  requirement  or  desire.  It  is  not  to  be used  solely  to  finish  an  advanced  degree  or  to  be  a  degree-granting  program.  LTFT academic  training  is  not  a  civilian  advance  education  program,  although  an  advanced degree may incidentally result from completing an identified training course. The EDM centrally budgets and manages training funds for LTFT based on funds availability. 12.4.2.  Use  of  DHP  to  Fund  Civilian  Employee  Training.  When  LAF  funding  (the EDM’s  central  budget)  is  completely  exhausted  for  CADP  and  LTFT  and  MTF  leadership  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   87  determines  that  an  employee’s  lack  of  training  will  be  detrimental  to  the  mission  of  the AFMS, then the MTF may use DHP funds for the civilian employee’s training. 12.4.2.1.  The request for CADP and LFT must first go through the base EDM for course approval  and  funding.    If  the  course  is  approved,  but  the  EDM  indicates  funds  are exhausted and no additional funds are expected in the FY (and the MTF cannot delay the employee’s training due to mission degradation), then the MTF may use DHP funds. 12.4.2.2.  The employee’s training folder must contain the EDM’s approval and relevant funding  correspondence  (i.e.,  if  the EDM’s  budget  was  exhausted  and DHP  funds  were used). 12.4.2.3.  All civilian training funded with DHP or any other appropriation, whether paid for via GPC or TDY funds, must be ESP coded "MA."  Retroactive JVs to add the ESP Code  must  be  accomplished  for  any  civilian  training  for  which  the  ESP  Code  was  not recorded in the accounting system. 12.5.  Air  Reserve  Component  (ARC).  The  student’s  assigned  organization  pays  the  TDY  to school  or  other  instructional  courses  for  ARC  (Air  Force  Reserve  and  Air  National  Guard) members.    However,  when  ordering  the  student  to  active  duty  to  fulfill  an  Air  Force  mission requirement,  apply  the  funding  rules  for  active  duty  military  personnel  (see  AFI  65-601  V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures). 12.6.  Active  Duty  Military  Personnel.  In  general,  if  the  Education  and  Training  Course Announcement (ETCA) (https://etca.keesler.af.mil/) does not indicate that central funding will be provided, then the member’s unit of assignment will pay the TDY costs.  See AFI 65-601 V1, for more information on funding for formal training courses. 12.7.  Accounting  for  Student  Travel  -  RCCC.  Student  travel  refers  broadly  to  all  travel  in support of Continuing Medical Education (CME), Graduate Medical Education (GME) and other programs  captured  under  program  element  86761F.    Although  there  are  multiple  RCCCs  that support  specific  programs,  most  MTFs  only  need  a  few,  primarily  in  the  3H582X  series.    If training  meets  the  criteria  to  be  considered  student  travel  and  you  do  not  have  a  more  specific RCCC to use, then use 3H5824 (Air Force-specific training without a formal course number is not  considered  CME;  civilian  board  certifying  organizations  that  provide  CME  are  outlined  in AFI 41-104). 12.8.  Reimbursement Examinations.  Refer to AFI 41-104. for Professional Board and  National  Certification 12.9.  Reimbursement  Prior  to  Course  Completion.  Per  DoDFMR  Vol  10,  Chapter  10, paragraph  110209,  individuals  enrolled  in  approved  medical  correspondence  courses  may  be reimbursed for course costs prior to course completion. Ensure satisfactory proof of expenses is presented  by  the  claimant  before  making  payment.  Appropriate  debt  collection  steps  are  to  be initiated for non-completion of course. 12.10.  Professional  Licenses  (Military  and  Civilian):  IAW  Comp  Gen  Decision  B-252467, and Comp Gen Decision B-248955, the Air Force generally cannot reimburse military or civilian professionals  for  obtaining  licenses  that  are  required  to  minimally  qualify  the  individuals  for federal employment in their  professional  fields. For example, if a physician or nurse cannot be employed  as  a  physician  or  a  nurse  in  the  military  or  federal  government  unless  the  license  is    88  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 obtained,  then  the  licensing  costs  are  not  reimbursable.  However,  if  the  physician  or  nurse  is required to hold an additional license for a particular duty, above and beyond the license that is required  to  qualify  the  individual  for  employment  in  the  individual's  profession,  then  the  Air Force  may  reimburse  the  individual  for  the  additional  license.  Such  circumstances  can  arise when  military  physicians  work  under  RSA  agreements  in  civilian  hospitals  that  require  an additional  state  licensure  above  what  is  minimally  required  for  federal  employment  as  military physicians in their respective specialties. In these circumstances, the approving official may (per 10 USC §1096) reimburse not more than $500 for the additional license fee. 12.9.1.  Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program (10 USC §1096).  In any case in which it is necessary for a member of the uniformed services to pay a professional license fee imposed by a government in order to provide health care services at a facility of a civilian health care provider pursuant to Resource Sharing Agreement (RSA), the member obtaining the  license  may  be  reimbursed  up  to  $500  of  the  amount  of  the  license  fee  paid  by  the member.    Prior  to  incurring  RSA  licensure  expenses,  the  MTF  must  first  consult  with  the supporting  Medical  Law  Consultant  in  order  to  address  whether  the  State  recognizes licensure portability under 10 USC § 1094(d).  Reimbursement is paid from the MTF’s DHP O&M appropriation.  (T-1). 12.9.2.  Reimbursement  for  Other  than  RSA-related  Licensure  Fees.    IAW  10  USC  §2015, MTFs may pay for expenses for members of the armed forces (e.g., such as graduates from the  Air  Force  Dental  Hygiene  Training  Scholarship  Program)  to  obtain  professional credentials, including expenses for professional accreditation, State-imposed and professional licenses, and professional certification, as well as the examinations to obtain such credentials, as long as the credentials are not a prerequisite for appointment in the armed forces.  Unlike 10 USC §1096, there is no $500 cap.   Reimbursement is  paid from the MTF’s  DHP O&M appropriation.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   89  Chapter 13 MEDICAL FACILITIES AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT 13.1.  Overview.  Medical  Logistics  provides  equipment,  materiel,  services,  and  information  to the  Air  Force  medical  mission.    AFI  41-209,  Medical  Logistics  Support,  provides  logistics policy,  procedures,  and  guidance  for  Air  Force  Medical  Logistics  (AFML)  activities.  AFI  41-201,  Managing  Clinical  Engineering  Programs,  contains  facility  management  and  medical equipment maintenance guidance. 13.2.  Sustainment, Restoration & Modernization (SRM). 13.2.1.  SRM Definitions. 13.2.1.1.  Sustainment  is  the  maintenance  and  repair  activities  necessary  to  keep  an inventory of facilities in good working order. It includes regularly scheduled adjustments and inspections, preventive maintenance tasks, and emergency response and service calls for  minor  repairs.  It  also  includes  major  repairs  or  replacement  of  facility  components that  are  expected  to  occur  periodically  throughout  the  life  cycle  of  facilities.  This  work includes regular roof replacement, refinishing of wall surfaces, repairing and replacement of heating and cooling systems, replacing tile and carpeting, and similar types of work. It does not include environmental compliance costs, facility leases, or other tasks associated with  facilities  operations  (such  as  custodial  services,  grounds  services,  waste  disposal, and the provision of central utilities). 13.2.1.2.  Restoration involves restoring real property to such a condition that it may be used  for  its  designated  purpose.  Restoration  includes  repair  or  replacement  work  to restore facilities damaged by inadequate sustainment, excessive age, natural disaster, fire, accident, or other causes. 13.2.1.3.  Modernization is the alteration or replacement of facilities solely to implement new  or  higher  standards,  to  accommodate  new  functions,  or  to  replace  building components that typically last more than 50 years (such as the framework or foundation). 13.3.  Accounting  for  SRM  Expenditures.  SRM  expenditures  must  be  properly  captured within BAG 7, using the relevant EEICs, PECs, and RCCCs.  (T-1). 13.3.1.  Quarterly MTF Facility Validation.  During the 1st month of each Quarter, the MTF Facility  Manager  must  contact  CE  to  request  a  screenshot  from  CE’s  Automated  Civil Engineer System (ACES).  ACES is the Air Force Accountable Property System of Record (APSR)  that  contains  the  AF-wide  inventory  of  AF-owned  facilities.    The  MTF  Facility Manager  must  ensure  that  the  facilities  designated  as  belonging  to  the  MTF  are  accurately reflected in ACES. 13.3.1.1.  The amount of funding the AFMS receives annually for facilities is dependent on the information contained within ACES. 13.3.1.2.  The  following  information  must  be  reflected  within  ACES  for  all  facilities assigned to the MTF. 13.3.1.2.1.  Organization Column: Each line must reflect 2H (represents that funding is provided by the Defense Health Agency).    90  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 13.3.1.2.2.  Appropriation Column: 13.3.1.2.2.1.  For the Replacement line:  Must reflect 0500 (MILCON). 13.3.1.2.2.2.  For  the  Operational,  Sustainment,  Restoration,  and  Acquisition lines:  Must reflect 0130 - DHP. 13.4.  Medical Equipment.  Refer to AFI 41-209, for guidance on requisitioning, procuring and managing medical equipment. 13.4.1.  Accountable medical equipment includes expense equipment, investment equipment, and or nonexpendable items as defined in AFI 41-209.  All equipment requires an approved authorization  prior  to  acquisition.    All  equipment  requirements  must  be  loaded  into  The Integrated  Global  Equipment  Request  System  (TIGERS)  equipment  request  application  for funding consideration: 13.4.1.1.  Medical  Expense  Equipment  is  equipment  with  a  unit  cost  of  less  than $249,999.  Typically, expense equipment with a unit cost of less than $100,000 is funded with  local  DHP  O&M  funds.    Expense  equipment  with  a  unit  cost  of  greater  than $100,000 and up to $249,999 is funded either with local DHP O&M funds or centrally-provided O&M funds. 13.4.1.2.  Medical  Investment  Equipment  is  equipment  with  a  unit  cost  of  $250,000  or greater.    Investment  equipment  is  funded  with  DHP  Procurement  funds.    Typically investment equipment is procured centrally. 13.4.1.3.  Initial  outfitting  equipment  for  military  construction  (MILCON)  projects  will generally  be  acquired  according  to  the  logistics  responsibilities  defined  in  MIL-STD-1691F.  See criteria for initial outfitting equipment in AFI 41-209. 13.5.  Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) System.  See AFMAN 41-216, Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) User’s Manual, for more information on DMLSS. 13.5.1.  DMLSS  is  an  automated  information  system  developed  to  enhance  health  care delivery  in  peacetime  and  to  promote  wartime  readiness  and  sustainability.  DMLSS  is developed and sustained by the Joint Medical Logistics Functional Development Center, an activity operating under the authority of ASD(HA) and staffed with functional experts from the  AFMS,  MEDCOM,  and  BUMED.    It  provides  price  comparison  tools  and  electronic commerce capabilities, enabling MTFs to select and order the best value item that meets their requirements. 13.5.2.  DMLSS’  basic  functionality  includes  stock  control,  prime  vendor  operations, research  and  price  comparison,  property  accounting,  biomedical  maintenance,  accountable equipment management, inventory management, and facility management. 13.5.3.  Framework for Understanding Obligations in DMLSS.  The DoD has authority under 10 USC §2208 and §2210 to establish the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF or WCF) to finance inventories of supplies and provide working capital for industrial and commercial-type activities. 13.5.3.1.  Activities  funded  through  WCFs  perform  work  for  others  under  several different  authorities.  These  include  the  Project  Order  Act  for  depots,  the  Economy  Act  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   91  (31  USC  §1535)  for  reimbursable  and  direct  citation  procurements,  and  supply management  operations  (stock  fund  operations)  that  use  WCF  contract  authority  to acquire assigned items of supply for other DoD Components. items  (e.g.  medical  supplies  and  medical 13.5.3.2.  Generally,  medical/surgical equipment)  ordered  through  DMLSS  are  obtained  via  the  Air  Force  Working  Capital Fund/Medical-Dental Division (AFWCF/MDD). 13.5.3.2.1.  The  AFWCF/MDD  (also  referred  to  as  the  “6B  Stock  Fund”)  is established through an Act of Congress (10 USC §2208), and gives the Secretary of Defense authority to finance inventories through DOD working capital funds. 13.5.3.2.2.  The  MDD  is  part  of  the  AF  Force  Working  Capital  Fund  (AFWCF).  MTF materiel obtained from the AFWCF/MDD are considered issues and/or sales to the MTF from the MDD, and therefore, the MTF must reimburse the AFWCF/MDD from its DHP appropriation for the items at the time of issue. 13.5.4.  Overview  of  MTF  Orders  Placed  in  DMLSS.      When  an  MTF  places  an  order  via DMLSS, appropriations are obligated in order to reimburse the AFWCF/MDD.  The order, or request for issue, results either in a sale, if the item is in stock, or a customer obligated due-out if it is not in stock. Once obligated, these funds remain obligated until the obligation is  liquidated,  even  though  delivery  may  occur  in  a  subsequent  FY.    Orders  placed  in DMLSS  must  be  received  within  a  reasonable  time-period  (generally  30  –  60  days  unless “lead-time  exception”  for  production  applies,  or  other  factors  outside  of  the  MTF’s  control have caused delays). 13.5.4.1.  “Parking” funds in DMLSS (or in any system) is prohibited.  Parking is a term used to describe a transfer of appropriations to a revolving fund to extend the availability of the appropriations.  Requirements obligated in DMLSS must meet the bona fide need criteria, and the requirements must be supported by a completed requisition package.  (T-0). 13.5.4.2.  DMLSS  interfaces  with  financial  systems  to  produce  daily  and  monthly financial  interface  files.   The  transactions  are  sent  by  DMLSS  via  the  Defense  Data Network to the Standard Materiel Accounting System (SMAS). 13.5.4.3.  SMAS  provides  obligation,  expense,  disbursement,  and  collection  data  to  the AF accounting system on a daily basis for the AFWCF/MDD.  There is a lag between the time  funds  are  obligated  in  DMLSS  and  when  the  obligations  will  be  visible  in  CRIS. RMOs must work with medical logistics to maintain visibility of DMLSS obligations—particularly during end of year close-out. 13.6.  Deobligations.  Deobligating  funds  is  a  collaborative  effort  between  Medical  Logistics, the COR, and RMO.  Continuous monitoring of the CRIS Open Document List (ODL) is vital.  It is  critical  that  MTFs  reconcile  the  obligation  status  of  all  orders  (including  contracts)  and deobligate unused funds in a timely manner (do not rely solely on transactions that appear on the tri-annual review list) to enable those deobligated funds to be applied toward other MTF needs prior  to  the  funds  expiring.    NOTE:    RMO  and  Medical  Logistics  should  collaborate  to  trace specific  medical  equipment  obligations  identified  with  an  Interface  Element  (IE)  code  on  the CRIS ODL.    92  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 13.7.  Delivery  of  Materials  Beyond  the  Fiscal  Year.  When  materials  cannot  be  obtained  in the  same  FY  in  which  they  are  needed,  provisions  for  delivery  in  the  subsequent  FY  is permissible so long as there is bona fide need in the FY being charged. 13.7.1.  An MTF may not obligate funds when it is apparent that there is no requirement until the following FY. 13.7.2.  Lead-Time Exception. Deliveries under a contract let in one FY may be delayed until the subsequent FY if the material contracted for is not obtainable on the open market at the time  needed  for  use,  provided  the  intervening  period  is  necessary  for  production  or fabrication of the material. 13.7.3.  MIPRs may not be used to violate provisions of law or to circumvent conditions and limitations imposed on the use of funds. For example, MIPRs may not be used to extend the period of availability of the cited funds.  (T-0). 13.7.4.  When materials are needed on a periodically recurring basis, the contract term may not exceed 1 year and only requirements for the first year can be classified as bona fide need of the year in which the contract is made.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   93  Chapter 14 DHP CONTRACTS 14.1.  Overview.  Contract Services, as addressed here, include all local purchases for equipment and  facility  maintenance,  professional  and  non-professional  services,  and  all  other  medical support services (laundry, waste, aseptic management, etc.) acquired by means other than GPC in accordance with AFI 41-209.  Services include continuous requirements (recurring purchases), as  well  as  one-time  purchases.    Effective  oversight  of  contracted  services  ensures  commanders make  informed  decisions  to  maximize  resources.    Contracts  must  be  supported  by  legally executed, written documentary evidence (a contract signed by an authorized Government agent, i.e.,  a  warranted  Contracting  Officer,  along  with  a  certified  Purchase  Request  signed  by  an authorized official).  (T-0). 14.2.  MTF  Responsibilities.  The  MTF  commander  is  responsible  for  the  overall  health  of contracts  in  their  respective  MTFs  and  appoints  the  Medical  Logistics  Flight  Commander (MLFC) as Functional Commander for medical contracting, IAW AFI 41-209. 14.2.1.  The  MLFC  can  appoint  a  service  contract  manager  to  oversee  the  MTF’s  contract services  section.  The  MLFC  can  delegate  authority  and  responsibility  for  execution  of  the program, but is still accountable for all actions. 14.2.2.  The  MLFC  or  contract  manager  coordinates  with  the  activity  requiring  the  service, all other pertinent functional areas, and the base contracting office (BCO) or other authorized DoD or  non-DoD contracting activity as  determined appropriate by the BCO, to  ensure the needs  of  the  requiring  activity  will  be  met  and  the  BCO  or  authorized  contracting  activity receives a "procurable package" in time to establish an effective and timely contract award. 14.2.3.  The  MLFC  or  contract  manager  is  responsible  for  coordination  with  the  using activity to ensure the service as described in the Performance Work Statement or Statement of  Work  meets  the  user's  needs.  They  are  the  liaison  between  the  user  and  the  contracting activity  in  all  aspects  of  requirements’  definition,  contract  award,  administration  and management. 14.2.4.  The  MLFC  or  contract  manager  periodically  interfaces  with  the  using  activity  to ensure  the  contract  continues  to  serve  the  purpose  intended.  A  variety  of  causes  may necessitate a contract modification. Only the BCO or appropriate contracting agency has the authority  to  modify  the  terms  of  the  contract  in  any  way.  Medical  Logistics  continually operates  in  a  proactive  mode  and  as  the  critical  link  between  the  QA  personnel,  the  using activity  and  the  contracting  activity  to  ensure  the  contractor  is  adhering  to  the  terms  of  the contract and the contract continues to meet the needs of the user. 14.3.  Contract Funding: 14.3.1.  Only contracts that are included in the AFMS POM are authorized for execution, for the  purposes  established  within  the  POM.    Funds  must  not  be  diverted  for  other  purposes.  Contracts must be funded using the corresponding POM appropriation. 14.3.2.  A non-POM contract that has been funded recurrently does not automatically become a  POM  contract.    If  the  requirement  exists  and  remains  a  priority,  it  must  be  programmed    94  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 IAW AFMS Medical Planning and Programming Guidance.  Continuing to fund those non-POM contracts exacerbates misalignments between execution and programming. 14.3.3.  Contracts  for  services,  regardless  of  the  dollar  value,  that  were  not  included  in  the POM, or for which a one-time distribution was not received (ex. gapfill of JIF funding) but are  deemed  necessary  during  the  current  year, will  be  submitted  via  to  AFMOA/SGAR  for review  and  approval.    (T-1).    The  following  procedures  will  be  employed  for  non-POM contracts. 14.3.3.1.  If approved and funded, contract funding will be provided for a 1-year period only.    Therefore,  MTFs/organizations  should  plan  accordingly  for  a  transition/exit strategy.    Long-term  sustainment  of  the  contract  must  be  addressed  during  the  POM process.  (T-1). 14.3.3.2.  Use of Medical Reimbursements to Fund Non-POM Contracts.  MTFs planning to  use  medical  reimbursements  stemming  from  TPC,  the  MSA  program,  or  the  MAC program to fund non-POM contracts must be extremely cautious not to violate the Anti-Deficiency Act.  Contracts may not be entered into with money that has not been received or collected.  (T-0).  14.3.3.2.1.  Spending  money  that  has  not  been  collected  creates  an  Anti-Deficiency Act violation in that it offends the U.S. Constitution Article 1, Section 9, Clause 7, "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." 14.3.3.2.2.  Additionally,  DoD  Financial  Management  Regulation  Vol  4,  Chap  16, Para 160402(A) and footnote 8 states: "Federal customer orders (funded requests for goods and services) provide budgetary resources to finance reimbursable operations; consequently,  customer  orders  must  be  obligations  of  a  federal  government  activity unless  otherwise  specified  by  law.    Only  customer  orders  from  federal  customers become  budgetary  resources  in  advance  of  collections.  Customer  orders  from  the public do not become budgetary resources until collected." 14.3.3.3.  If an organization opts to fund a contract that was not authorized in their POM, and for which additional authority has not been provided (i.e., one-time or UFR funding), the MTF should present an offset and be able to substantiate the adjustment.  Otherwise, not only is the MTF at risk, but the AFMS as well.  These actions create a domino effect (e.g., something else will have to go unfunded in order to cover the shortfall). 14.3.3.4.  Manpower Validation Process (MVP).  Contact AFMOA/SGAR for a copy of the  link  to  the  MVP  business  rules.    In  order  to  prevent  unnecessary  risk  at  the  AFMS level, AFMOA has established the MVP to review and approve non-POM contracts.  All requests  for  non-POM  contracts  will  be  routed  through  AFMOA  regardless  of  local funding availability.  (T-1). 14.4.  Acquisition of Services.  Refer to AFI 41-209 and AFI 63-138, Acquisition of Services. 14.5.  Deobligating  Contract  Funding.  When  a  contract  requires  funds  deobligation,  Medical Logistics  coordinates  with  the  end  user,  the  RMO,  and  the  contract  office.    Medical  Logistics accomplishes  all  necessary  documentation.    RMOs  should  continually  communicate  with Medical Logistics to identify deobligation opportunities.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   95  14.6.  Authorization for Personal Services Contracts.  Personal Services contracts for experts and  consultants  are  authorized  by  P.L.101-165,  Sec  9002  subject  to  terms  and  restrictions  as stipulated in DFARS 237.104 (b) (I), Personal Services Contracts. 14.6.1.  Personal Services contracts for healthcare providers are authorized by 10 USC §1091 subject to terms and restrictions as stipulated in DFARS 237.104 (b) (ii) and DODI 6025.5, Personal  Services  Contracts  for  Health  Care  Providers.    Requests  to  enter  into  a  personal service  contract  for  direct  health  care  services  must  be  approved  by  the  MTF  commander.  (T-1).    Refer  to  AFI  41-209,  for  more  detailed  guidance  on  requisitioning  personal  service contracts. 14.6.2.  Under Title 10, DoD may enter into personal services contracts as necessary to carry out health care responsibilities.  Only DoD contracting offices are authorized to award MTF personal  service  contracts.    Title  3,  Section  102  stipulates  the  compensation  paid  to  an individual  in  any  year  under  a  personal  services  contract  may  not  exceed  $400,000  plus expenses (not to exceed $50,000). 14.6.3.  Personal  services  contract  employees  are  managed  as  if  they  are  direct  employees such  as civil service or active duty personnel. In this case, the government is  more directly involved  in  the  hiring  process  and  indemnifies  (self-insures)  the  individual  for  malpractice, i.e., they are covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act. 14.6.4.  Personal  service  contract  employees  must  maintain  an  active  license  or  authorizing document  from  any  U.S.  jurisdiction  while  non-personal  service  contract  employees  must maintain  an  active  license  or  authorizing  document  from  the  state  in  which  they  are practicing.  For  more  information  regarding  healthcare  providers  see  AFI  44-119,  Medical Quality Operations. 14.7.  Economy  Act  Orders.  (Reference    AFI  65-116,  Air  Force  Purchases  Using  Military Interdepartmental  Purchase  Requests  (MIPRS);  DoDFMR  Vol  11A,  Chap  3;  DoD  Instruction 4000.19,  Interservice  and  Intragovernmental  Support;  the  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Subpart 17.5, Interagency Acquisitions Under the Economy Act; and the Defense Federal Acquisition  Regulation  Supplement  (DFARS),  Subpart  217.5,  Interagency  Acquisitions  Under the Economy Act.) 14.7.1.  The Economy Act provides authority for federal agencies to order goods and services from  other  federal  agencies  (including  other  Military  Departments  and  Defense  Agencies) and to pay the actual costs of those goods and services. The Congress passed the Act in 1932 to obtain economies of scale and eliminate overlapping activities of the federal government.  The BCO decides if the order is in the best interest of the United States (U.S.) Government. 14.7.2.  Economy  Act  orders  may  not  be  used  by  an  agency  to  circumvent  conditions  and limitations imposed on the use of funds, including extending the period of availability of the cited  funds.  Acquisitions  under  the  Economy  Act  are  subject  to  the  requirements  of  FAR Subpart 7.3, Contractor Versus Government Performance. 14.7.3.  The Economy Act may not be used to make acquisitions conflicting with any other agency’s authority or responsibility (see FAR Subpart 17.502). 14.7.4.  An Economy Act order cannot be used by one organizational unit to order work or services  from  another  organizational  unit  under  the  same  activity  commander  where  the    96  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 activity commander is in a position to fund the required goods or services through the use of direct funds. 14.7.5.  Use  of  MIPRs  for  Non-Economy  Act  Orders.    Prepare  MIPRs  per  AFI  65-116  and any other guidance issued by Higher Headquarters.  The Base FM must certify that funds are available  and  committed  within  10  calendar  days  of  funds  certification.    For  reimbursable (Category I) MIPRs, DFAS obligates funds per the amounts reflected on the DD Form 448-2, MIPR  Acceptance  within  10  calendar  days  of  acceptance  or  contract  approval.    For  direct cite MIPRs (Category II), DFAS obligates funds based on the contract amount.  (T-0) 14.7.5.1.  Receiving  Goods/Services.    AFMS  organizations  must  ensure  that  a  process exists to  verify the goods or  services invoiced by the performing  agencies are reviewed and  accepted  by  government  personnel  who  are  in  a  position  to  know  whether goods/services were actually received per MIPR/contractual requirements.  (T-0) 14.7.5.2.  MIPR Invoices.  Some performing agencies do not use a standardized invoice to  reflect  charges  made  to  the  MIPR.    In  those  cases,  the  performing  agency  should provide  to  the  government  official  accepting  the  goods/services  an  invoice  that—at  a minimum—contains  an invoice  number,  date,  amount  billed,  description  of goods/services  provided,  any  discounts,  full  address  of  the  organization  providing  the goods/services, the document number of the MIPR being charged, a point of contact and a  phone  number  for  billing  inquiries.    Invoices  must  be  filed  with  the  certified/signed MIPR, MIPR acceptance form (DD Form 448-2) and filed for 6 years, 3 months.  Verify that the invoiced amounts are accurately reflected in the accounting system, and that the proper line of accounting was charged.  (T-0) 14.8.  Non-Economy Act Orders.  Reference AFI 65-116, Air Force Purchases Using Military Interdepartmental  Purchase  Requests  (MIPRS),  and  DoDFMR  Vol  11A,  Chapter  18.  Non-Economy Act orders are prepared when a DoD activity needing goods and services obtains them from  a  non-DoD  agency.  Specific  statutory  authority  is  required  to  place  an  order  with  a  non-DoD agency for goods or services, and to pay the associated cost. If specific statutory authority does not exist, the default will be the Economy Act which is discussed in DoDFMR Volume 11A Chapter 3. 14.8.1.  Non-Economy Act orders obligating annual or multiyear appropriation must satisfy a bona  fide  need  of  the  appropriation’s  period  of  availability.  The  requesting  DoD  activity must obligate funds when the performing activity accepts the order in writing.  (T-0). 14.8.2.  By  policy  and  agreement  with  civilian  agencies  that  have  non-Economy  Act authorities  to  perform  reimbursable  orders,  the  DoD  has  further  limited  the  fiscal  principle that a performing agency with non-Economy Act authority has a reasonable period of time to use transferred funds. Thus, DoDFMR Chapter 11A provides that funds must be deobligated by both the requesting and performing  agency to the extent that the performing  agency has not, before the end of the period of availability of the DoD requesting agency appropriation, provided  the  goods  or  services,  or  entered  into  contract  obligations  with  another  entity (contractor) to provide the requested goods or services in a manner consistent with the bona fide needs rule. 14.8.3.  Use  of  MIPRs  for  Non-Economy  Act  Orders.    Prepare  MIPRs  per  AFI  65-116  and any other guidance issued by Higher Headquarters.  The Base FM must certify that funds are  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   97  available  and  committed  within  10  calendar  days  of  funds  certification.    For  reimbursable (Category I) MIPRs, DFAS obligates funds per the amounts reflected on the DD Form 448-2, MIPR  Acceptance  within  10  calendar  days  of  acceptance  or  contract  approval.    For  direct cite MIPRs (Category II), DFAS obligates funds based on the contract amount.  (T-0) 14.8.3.1.  Receiving  Goods/Services.    AFMS  organizations  must  ensure  that  a  process exists to  verify the goods or  services invoiced by the performing  agencies are reviewed and  accepted  by  government  personnel  who  are  in  a  position  to  know  whether goods/services were actually received per MIPR/contractual requirements.  (T-0) 14.8.3.2.  MIPR Invoices.  Some performing agencies do not use a standardized invoice to  reflect  charges  made  to  the  MIPR.    In  those  cases,  the  performing  agency  should provide  to  the  government  official  accepting  the  goods/services  an  invoice  that—at  a minimum—contains  an invoice  number,  date,  amount  billed,  description  of goods/services  provided,  any  discounts,  full  address  of  the  organization  providing  the goods/services, the document number of the MIPR being charged, a point of contact and a  phone  number  for  billing  inquiries.    Invoices  must  be  filed  with  the  certified/signed MIPR, MIPR acceptance form (DD Form 448-2) and filed for 6 years, 3 months.  Verify that the invoiced amounts are accurately reflected in the accounting system, and that the proper line of accounting was charged. (T-0) 14.9.  Support  Agreements.  Reference  AFI  25-201,  Intra-Service,  Intra-Agency,  and  Inter-Agency  Support  Agreements  Procedures;  AFI  65-601,  Volume  1,  Budget  Guidance  and Procedures,  and  DoDI  4000.19,  Interservice  and  Intragovernmental  Support.    A  support agreement  is  a  written  agreement  that  establishes  the  roles  and  responsibilities  for  recurring support between the requiring activity and the assisting agency.  Support agreements executed on DD  Form  1144  may  be  Intraservice  (AF  to  AF),  Interservice  (AF  to  other  Service  or  DoD component),  or  Intragovernmental  (AF  to  non-DoD  Federal  Activities).    Support  agreements may also be a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). 14.9.1.  DD  Form  1144,  Support  Agreement.  Per  DoDI  4000.19,  a  DD  Form  1144  will  be used to document recurring reimbursable support where the Air Force or DoD Component is the Supplier. Non-reimbursable support may also be included on the form but it will not be used to document only non-reimbursable support unless both parties agree to use a DD Form 1144 in lieu of an MOA or MOU.  See AFI 25-201 Attachment 2 for details of the DD Form 1144  entries.  When  a  non-DoD  Federal  Agency  or  federally-recognized  Indian  tribe  is  the Supplier, the Air  Force may use  the Supplier’s standard support agreement documents, DD Form 1144, or the Financial Management Service (FMS) Form 7600, Interagency Agreement (IAA)  –  Agreement  between  Federal  Agencies  for  these  support  agreements  with  the  Air Force as agreed between the Air Force and the other party. 14.9.2.  Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA).    In  the  absence  of  a  DD  Form  1144  or equivalent  support  agreement,  an  MOA  will  be  used  to  document  the  specific  terms  and responsibilities  that  two  or  more  parties  agree  to  in  writing,  especially  those  that  involve reimbursement.  MOAs  can  be  used  to  document  a  single  reimbursable  purchase,  non-recurring  reimbursable  support,  and  non-reimbursable  support.  Consecutive  reimbursable MOAs  shall  not  be  used  for  similar  single  reimbursable  purchases  or  non-recurring reimbursable  support  to  circumvent  the  use  of  DD  Form  1144  or  equivalent  support agreement  unless  the  conditions  in  AFI  25-201,  paragraph  3.2.6  apply.  Any  obligation  of    98  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 funds  in  support  of  the  MOA  will  be  accomplished  using  a  DD  Form  448,  Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (or equivalent form with a non-DoD Federal agency or federally-recognized  Indian  tribe).  The  obligation  of  funds  by  the  parties  is  subject  to availability  of  appropriated  funds  pursuant  to  the  DoDFMR.    DoDI  4000.19,  Enclosure  3, Figure 1, Sample MOA Template identifies the information that will be included in an MOA. 14.9.3.  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). An MOU will be used to document issues of general understanding between two or more parties that do not  involve reimbursement. Regardless of the format used, DoDI 4000.19, Enclosure 3, Figure 2, Sample MOU Template identifies the information that will be included in an MOU. 14.9.4.  Command-Level  MOA.  This  broad  MOA  is  an  agreement  between  or  among MAJCOMs, Numbered Air Forces (NAFs), or MAJCOM-equivalent Commands to identify parameters for developing support agreements between subordinate units. The Suppliers and Receivers at the installation level use these broad MOAs as a source document in addressing the  provision  of  services,  funding,  and  reimbursement  arrangements  for  continued  support. However, an MOA alone will not be used to affect the transfer of funds or other resources; only the DD Form 448 will serve that purpose for MOAs with a reimbursable requirement. 14.9.5.  Functional  Area  MOU.  The  Supplier’s  subordinate  units  may  use  MOUs  between functional  areas  to  document  mutually-agreed  upon  roles  and  responsibilities,  such  as statement of facts, intentions, and procedures for future actions that can be used in a formal support  agreement.  The  Functional  OPR  (e.g.,  Civil  Engineer,  Security  Forces)  will  draft, sign,  and  maintain  these  documents,  which  are  procedural  or  technical  in  nature.  The Supplier’s  Manpower  and  Financial  organizations  and  the  Judge  Advocate  (JA)  office  will review  and  coordinate  on  functional  area  MOUs  for  reimbursement,  manpower,  and  legal implications that will need to be incorporated in a formal support agreement. The functional OPR  maintains  these  MOUs  and  provides  a  copy  to  the  Supplier  Support  Agreement Manager for inclusion in the applicable support agreements. 14.10.  Recording  Obligations  Pertaining  to  Contracts.  Recording  obligations  in  the  Air Force financial system is the responsibility of the base FM office and DFAS.  Obligations must be  recorded  accurately  based  on  the  amount  stated  on  the  contract/modification  and  to  the appropriate line of accounting as determined by the RMO.  RMOs must verify that DFAS posts each contract accurately and timely (DFAS should posts obligations within 10 calendar days of the contract/modification being signed (reference DoDFMR V3, Chap 8, para 080301(A).  (T-0). Generally, the following information applies when recording obligations. 14.10.1.  Firm  Fixed-Price  Contract.  When  the  contract  is  executed,  an  obligation  shall  be recorded for the total amount stated in the contract.  (T-0). 14.10.2.  Cost-Reimbursement  and  Time-and-Material  Contracts.  Cost-reimbursement  and time-and-material  contracts  include:  cost,  cost-sharing,  cost-plus-fixed-fee,  cost-plus-incentive-fee, cost-plus-award-fee, time-and-material, and labor-hour contracts. 14.10.2.1.  When the contract is executed, an obligation shall be recorded. The amount of the  obligation  is  the  total  estimated  payment  provided  by  the  contract’s  funded  ceiling, including the fixed fee in the case of a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, the target fee in  the case of a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract, or the base fee in the case of a cost-plus-award-fee contract. The amount recorded shall be increased or decreased by amounts provided  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   99  by  contract  amendments,  or  a  unilateral  revision  of  an  award  fee  estimate  made  by  the contracting office.  (T-0). 14.10.2.2.  Any  fee  awarded  in  excess  of  the  target  fee  in  a  cost-plus-incentive-fee contract  shall  be  recorded  as  an  obligation  at  the  time  the  determination  to  award  the larger  fee  is  provided  to  the  contractor.  The  amount  of  the  obligation  established  for  a cost-plus-award-fee contract shall be adjusted at the time the actual fee award amount is determined and the contractor notified or, if applicable, a provisional award fee payment is  determined  (see  DFARS  216.405-2).  In  any  of  these  cases,  if  the  contract  is incrementally funded, the amount obligated shall always be the funded increments. 14.10.3.  Indefinite-Delivery Type Contracts. Where the quantity required under a contract is indefinite, the ultimate amount of obligation is determined by subsequent orders; the amount of  any  required  minimum  order  specified  in  the  contract,  however,  shall  be  recorded  as  an obligation upon execution of the contract. 14.10.3.1.  For contracts that require the contractor to perform unilaterally placed orders above  the  required  minimum,  record  an  obligation  in  the  amount  of  the  order  price  or ceiling at the time the order is placed. 14.10.3.2.  An  order  in  excess  of  the  required  minimum  that  has  to  be  negotiated  or accepted by the contractor under terms of the contract shall be recorded as an obligation upon contractor’s acceptance of the order in the amount of the agreed price or ceiling. In the case of orders for services where a contractor cannot undertake performance without direction from an authorized Government official, order amounts may be a consolidated periodically (at least monthly) into a list of orders placed with the contractor identifying the  estimated  dollar  amount  of  each.  On  definite-quantity  contracts,  obligate  the  full amount of the definite quantity at the time of contract award. 14.10.3.3.  Contract  Authorizing  Variations  in  Quantities  to  be  Delivered.  When  the contract is executed, an obligation shall be recorded for the price of the quantity specified for delivery, exclusive of the permitted variation. The amount recorded may be increased or decreased to reflect the quantity actually delivered and accepted. 14.10.4.  Multiyear  Procurement  Contract.  An  obligation  for  a  multiyear  procurement contract shall be recorded in the amount of the price of the quantities specified for delivery under the requirement for the first program year, and the amount shall be identified with that program  year.  Unless  the  contract  is  funded  fully  at  inception,  each  time  the  contractor  is notified  that  funds  are  available  to  cover  another  program  year  requirement,  an  obligation shall  be  identified  with  that  program  year  and  recorded  in  the  amount  of  the  price  of  the quantities specified for delivery. If the contract is canceled, an obligation shall normally be charged  to  the  program  year  current  at  the  time  of  cancellation  to  cover  the  government’s liability under the terms of the contract. 14.11.  Timely  Invoicing  and  Vendor  Payments.  The  Prompt  Payment  Act  (PPA),  31  USC Chapter  39,  requires  DoD  Components  to  pay  bills  on  time,  pay  interest  penalties  when payments are made late, and take discounts only when payments are made by the discount date and the discount is economically justified. Refer to DoDFMR Volume 10, Chapter 7. 14.12.  Supporting  Documents  Required  to  Process  Payments.  Before  making  a  payment, DoD Components must ensure that appropriate payment documentation is established to support    100  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 payment  of  invoices  and  interest  penalties.    (T-0).    This  documentation  normally  includes  the contract/purchase order, receipt/acceptance report, and a proper invoice.  Payments are based on the receipt of a proper invoice and satisfactory contract performance. Unless otherwise stated in the  contract,  vendors/contractors  will  submit  a  proper  invoice  to  request  payment.    Refer  to DoDFMR Volume 10, Chapter 8. 14.12.1.  Receipt  and  Acceptance  Report.  As  defined  by  FAR  2.101,  a  receiving  report  is written  evidence  that  indicates  Government  acceptance  of  supplies  delivered  or  services performed.  AFMS organizations must ensure a process exists to verify the goods or services invoiced  are  accepted  by  government  personnel  who  are  in  a  position  to  know  whether goods/services were actually received per contractual requirements.  (T-0).  Acceptance must occur  as  a  condition  of  payment  in  all  cases  except  contract  financing  payments,  interim payments on cost-reimbursement contracts for the acquisition of services, and fast payment procedures  as  defined  in  DoDFMR  Volume  10,  Chapter  7.  As  stated  in  DFARS  Subpart 232.70,  contractors  will  submit  payment  requests  and  receiving  reports  in  the  accepted electronic  form  using  WAWF.  DFARS  232-7003  defines  exceptions  to  this  policy.  If approved by the contracting officer and stated in the contract, non-electronic forms that may be  used  as  a  receiving  report  include,  but  are  not  limited  to  a  DD  Form  250  Material Inspection and Receiving Report, or a Standard Form 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher. The primary means for documenting receipt and acceptance of goods and services is the DD Form 250. The DFARS Appendix F, Part 3 contains preparation instructions for the DD 250. 14.12.1.1.  A receiving report performs two functions: (1) it provides evidence of the date goods  are  received,  and  (2)  it  provides  evidence  of  the  date  goods  or  services  are accepted. Receiving reports are written or electronic evidence of the receipt of goods or services  by  a  government  official.    The  accepting  government  official  (who  is  in  a position  to  know  whether  goods/services  were  actually  received  per  contractual requirements)  must  validate  the  accuracy  (rates/contract  terms)  of  the  receiving  report prior to signing for goods/services.  (T-0).  When an invoice is received by DFAS, it will be reflected as a payable (Accrued Expenditures Unpaid or AEU) within the accounting system  until  such  time  as  the  accepting  government  official  accepts  the  goods/services and signs the receiving report (i.e., the 2-in-1 invoice within WAWF). 14.12.1.2.  Receipt  of  goods  ordinarily  does  not  provide  a  basis  for  payment.  Payments must be based upon acceptance of the goods or services as authenticated by the signature of  the  government  official.    The  Contracts  are  normally  paid  from  invoices  routed through  the Wide  Area  Workflow  (WAWF).    AFMS  organizations  must  ensure  that  all disbursements (contract payments) are recorded accurately and posted to the correct line of  accounting  (as  stated  on  the  contract/modification).    Also,  ensure  that  if  a  prompt payment discount is offered on the contract, that DFAS applies it to the transaction (this is  typically  verifiable  via  Integrated  Accounts  Payable  System  [IAPS]).    A  mismatch between  the  amount  reflected  on  an  invoice  and the  amount  reflected  in  the  accounting system  or  CRIS  is  usually  indicative  that  DFAS  applied  either  a  discount  or  a  late payment penalty.  Verification via IAPS should be pursued, otherwise, contact DFAS for assistance in researching the mismatch.  (T-0). 14.12.1.2.1.  Follow  local  base  Contracting  and  base  FM  guidance  pertaining  to receipt/acceptance  timeline  requirements.  Generally:    The  agency  receiving  official should  forward  the  receiving  report,  or  other  government  documentation,  to  the  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   101  designated  DFAS  payment  office  by  the  5th  working  day  after  government acceptance or approval, unless other arrangements have been made. 14.12.1.2.2.  Government  acceptance  is  normally  deemed  to  occur  constructively  on the 7th  day after the contractor delivers supplies or  performs services in  accordance with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  contract,  unless  there  is  a  disagreement  over quantity,  quality,  or  contractor  compliance  with  a  contract  requirement.  A  longer acceptance period can be specified in the contract, in which case the date of the actual acceptance or the date on which such acceptance period ends shall substitute for the normally applied 7th day after the delivery date (refer to DFARS 232.904). The date on  which  the  designated  acceptance  period  ends  is  referred  to  as  the  constructive acceptance  date.  Constructive  acceptance  is  used  simply  for  the  purposes  of calculating  PPA  interest  and  applies  to  both  destination  acceptance  and  source acceptance contract terms. 14.12.2.  Proper Invoice. As defined by FAR 2.101, an invoice is a contractor's bill or written request  for  payment  under  the  contract  for  supplies  delivered  or  services  performed. According to  DFARS  Subpart  232.70,  vendors,  with  few  exceptions  (see  DFARS  252.232-7003(b)  and  (c)),  are  required  to  invoice  electronically  using  WAWF.  When  vendors  are permitted  to  invoice  in  a  non-electronic  manner,  they  may  submit  invoices  on  any  type  of form  approved  by  the  contracting  officer,  provided  all  contract  required  items  of  a  proper invoice  are  included  on  the  document,  unless  their  contract  prescribes  a  specific  form  of invoicing.  Title  5  CFR  1315.9(b)(1)  and  FAR  32.905(b)  contain  the  items  that  must  be included on a proper invoice in accordance with the PPA. The required documentation cited in the CFR must contain correct information to constitute a proper invoice and is required as payment  documentation.  If  an  invoice  is  improper  or  does  not  meet  the  contract requirements,  then  the  designated  activity  (usually  DFAS)  will  return  the  invoice  to  the contractor.  Payment will be based on the receipt of a proper invoice and satisfactory contract performance. 14.12.2.1.  Recurrent  Payments/Fixed  Amounts.  Payments  for  services  of  a  continuing nature  (e.g.,  rents,  janitorial  services)  which  are  performed  under  agency-vendor agreements providing for payments of definite amounts at fixed periodic intervals may be made without submission of invoices or bills by the vendor. The voucher prepared by the payment  office  to  support  payments  of  this  nature  should  show,  at  a  minimum,  the contract number, the period covered by the payment, the name of the vendor, the amount of the payment, and the account to be charged. The payment voucher will be certified for payment  the  same  as  are  the  vouchers  for  all  other  types  of  payments.  Administrative controls should be established for ensuring that recurrent payments are: (1) on unexpired contracts or agreements, (2) for correct amounts, (3) for services actually performed, and (4)  are  not  duplications.  See  DoDFMR  Vol  10,  Chapter  8  and  TFM  Volume  1  Part  4, Section 2025.30. 14.12.2.2.  Lost or Destroyed Invoices. If an original invoice has been lost or destroyed, then a duplicate will be obtained from the original submitter of the invoice to support the payment. 14.12.2.3.  Follow-up  for  Required  Documents.  If  payments  cannot  be  made  due  to  the non-receipt  of  receiving  reports,  copies  of  contracts,  contract  modifications,  or  other    102  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 required  documentation,  the  MTF  contract  manager/contract  COR  will  follow-up  with the vendor to ensure that these documents are forwarded in a timely manner. 14.12.3.  Document Retention.  Payment documentation  and associated documents (copy of the signed contract, receiving report, invoice), to include electronically submitted documents, will  be  retained  as  government  records  in  a  format  readily  accessible  for  a  6-year  3-month period  after  final  payment  under  the  contract.  See  National  Archives  and  Records Administration  (NARA),  General  Records  Schedule  3,  “Procurement,  Supply,  and  Grant Records”.  Extensions  to  this  record  retention  period  may  be  warranted  on  a  case-by-case basis  when  determined  necessary  that  the  records  are  needed  beyond  the  6-year  3-month period  to  complete  reconciliation  of  payment  or  collection  discrepancies,  audit  readiness requirements, or for other necessary purposes. 14.13.  Intragovernmental  Payments.  The SF 1080 and the SF 1081 are the authorized forms used  to  process  intragovernmental  payments.    The  Intragovernmental  Payment  and  Collection (IPAC)  system  is  the  primary  non-interfund  method  federal  entities  use  to  electronically  bill and/or pay for services and supplies within the government. The IPAC system communicates to the  Department  of  the  Treasury  and  the  trading  partner  agency  that  the  online  billing  and/or payment  for  services  and  supplies  occurred.  Per  the  DoDFMR  Vol  10,  Chapter  10,  all intragovernmental payments shall be supported by one of the formal payment vouchers. 14.13.1.  SF  1080.  Components  will  use  the  SF 1080  to  bill  other  government  agencies.    If the same entity accounts for and reports on the funds charged and credited, then the “billing” and  “billed”  offices  are  the  same.  In  such  cases,  if  the  transfer  is  within  the  same appropriation,  then  use  a  journal  voucher;  if  different  appropriations  are  involved,  then  use the “no check drawn” basis SF 1080. 14.13.2.  SF  1081.  The  SF  1081  is  used  for  correcting  prior  expenditure  or  collection transactions and for processing expenditure transactions not requiring payment by check. 14.13.3.  GSA  789.  The  GSA  789  “Statement,  Voucher,  and  Schedule  of  Withdrawals  and Credits” is an authorized payment voucher for purchases from GSA. 14.14.  Proactive  Contract  Modifications.  Certain  occurrences  necessitate contract modifications.    These  occurrences  must  be  anticipated  well  in  advance  of  the  requirement  to modify  the  contract.  Examples  are:  exercise  an  option  to  extend  the  contract;  decrease  the number of service contract personnel due to MTF downsizing and impending facility renovation. 14.14.1.  Funding  Contract  Modifications.      The  contracting  officer  is  primarily  responsible for  determining  whether  a  change  is  within-scope  or  scope  increase  or  decrease  in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the DoD FAR Supplement, legal principles applicable to scope changes, and the provisions of the DoDFMR. In cases where no clear cut determination can be made by the COR, the  cognizant Air Force legal counsel shall provide appropriate guidance and determinations concerning the scope of a contract. 14.14.2.  The  baseline  scope  of  a  contract  is  all  work  that  is  contracted  for  prior  to  the expiration  of  funds.  This  includes  changes  incorporated  by  modification,  provided  they  are within  scope.    Prior  year  funds  may  be  used  to  fund  within  scope  changes  with  approved upward adjustment validated in the Obligation Adjustment Reporting System (OARS).  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   103  14.14.3.  Increases  in  the  number  of  end  items  or  additional  deliverable  services  are  scope changes and funded by appropriations available at the time that the change is made. 14.14.4.  Claims  arising  out  of  an  original  undertaking,  or  resulting  from  a  within-scope change,  would  be  funded  from  the  appropriation  available  at  the  time  of  the  original undertaking. Claims arising out of a change-in-scope to the original contract would be funded from the appropriation available and charged for the change-in-scope. 14.15.  Severable and Non-severable Service Contracts.  Service contracts can be for either a single undertaking or end item (non-severable or entire) or for performance with compensation fixed in proportion to the amount of service performed (severable). 14.15.1.  The  general  rule  is  that  contracts  and  options  for  severable  services  are  paid  with funds that are current for new obligations at the time the services are performed.  There is a legal exception that permits agencies to enter into a contract that crosses fiscal years and that obligates funds of the fiscal year in which the contract was awarded for the entire period of performance  as  long  as  the  basic  contract,  option,  or  order  does  not  exceed  one  year.  Severable  services  are  services  that  are  continuing  and  recurring  in  nature  e.g.,  lawn maintenance, janitorial services, or security services where an agency realizes a benefit at the time  that  services  are  provided  even  if  the  contract  has  not  been  performed  to  completion. Services  are  considered  severable  if  they  can  be  separated  into  components  that independently provide value to meet some of an agency’s needs. 14.15.2.  Contracts  for  non-severable  services  must  be  awarded,  performance  must  begin, and  be  fully  funded  in  the  fiscal  year  for  which  funds  are  current  at  time  of  award.    (T-0).  Performance may extend across multiple fiscal years until the deliverable is received.  Non-severable  services  represent  a  single  undertaking  that  cannot  be  feasibly  subdivided.  If  the services produce a single or unified outcome, product, or report, the services are considered non-severable. An example would be consulting study, conducted over a period of time but culminating in the delivery of a final product. 14.16.  Protests.  Per 31 USC §1558, funds available for obligation for a contract  at  the time a protest  is  filed  in  connection  with  a  solicitation  for,  proposed  award  of,  or  award  of  a  contract remain available for obligation for one hundred (100) calendar days, unless otherwise specified, after  the  date  on  which  the  final  ruling  is  made  on  the  protest.    As  used  in  this  paragraph,  the term “protest” means any protest filed with the General Accounting Office (GAO) pursuant to 31 USC Chapter 35, Subchapter V. The term “protest” also means an action filed in court or under agency  administrative  procedures  where that  action  involves:  a challenge  to  a  solicitation  for  a contract; a proposed award of a contract; an award of a contract; or the eligibility of an offeror or potential offeror for a contract or of the contractor awarded the contract; and the action delays or prevents an agency from awarding a contract or proceeding with the procurement. 14.17.  Contingent  Liabilities  Remaining  under  Outstanding  Contracts.  IAW  DoDFMR, Vol  3,  Chap  8,  there  are  contingent  liabilities  for  price  or  quantity  increases  or  other  variables that  cannot  be  recorded  as  valid  obligations  in  the  cases  of  outstanding  fixed-price  contracts containing  escalation,  price  redetermination,  or  incentive  clauses,  or  contracts  authorizing variations  in  quantities  to  be  delivered,  or  contracts  where  allowable  interest  may  become payable by the U.S. Government on contractor claims supported by written appeals pursuant to the  “Disputes”  clause  contained  in  the  contract.  Amounts  to  cover  these  contingent  liabilities should be carried as outstanding commitments pending determination of actual obligations. The    104  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 amounts of such contingent liabilities, however, need not be recorded at the maximum or ceiling prices  under  the  contracts.  Rather,  amounts  should  be  committed  that  are  estimated conservatively to be sufficient to cover the additional obligations that probably will materialize, based  upon  judgment  and  experience.  In  determining  the  amount  to  be  committed,  allowances may  be  made  for  the  possibility  of  downward  price  revisions  and  quantity  under  runs.  Each contingent liability shall be supported by sufficient detail to facilitate audit. 14.18.  Termination  of  Contracts  and  Agreements.  When  a  contract  or  agreement  is terminated in whole or in part for the convenience of the government by the giving of a “Notice of Termination” to the other party to the contract or agreement, the obligation recorded for the contract  or  agreement  shall  be  decreased  to  an  amount  that  is  sufficient  to  meet  the  settlement costs  under  the  termination.  The  obligation  shall  not  be  decreased  below  the  amount  estimated by  the  COR,  based  on  the  best  evidence  then  available,  as  the  amount  due  as  a  result  of  the termination. 14.19.  Replacement  Contracts  due  to  Contractor  Default.  Where  it  becomes  necessary  to terminate  a  contract  because  of  the  contractor’s  default,  the  funds  obligated  under  the  original contract are available, beyond their original period of obligational availability, for the purpose of engaging  another  contractor  to  complete  the  unfinished  work.    Only  contracting  officers  and Legal Offices may determine whether the original funds may be used for replacement contracts. 14.19.1.  Implicit  in  the  replacement  contract  rule  is  the  premise  that  the  original  contract validly  obligated  then  current  funds.    In  addition,  the  rule  is  based  on  the  notion  that  the default  termination  does  not  eliminate  the  bona  fide  need  of  the  fiscal  year  in  which  the original  contract  was  executed.  (44  Comp.  Gen.  399,  401  (1965).    In  accordance  with  31 USC §1502, amounts from the appropriation  available at  the time the original contract was entered  would  remain  available  to  fund  costs  properly  chargeable  to  that  appropriation. (GAO  B-242274, Aug. 27, 1991). Accordingly, the replacement contract seeks only to meet the agency’s preexisting and continuing need relying on the budget authority obligated by the original contract. 14.19.2.  In order for funds to remain available beyond expiration for a replacement contract, three conditions must be met. The replacement contract shall be made without undue delay after the termination of the original contract.  Its purpose shall be to fulfill a bona fide need that has continued from the original contract.  The replacement contract shall be awarded on the same basis and be substantially similar to the original contract in its scope and size. 14.19.3.  Reprocurement  or  completion  costs,  liquidated  damages,  and  performance  bond money  recovered  from  the  contractor  as  refunds  may  also  be  retained  and  applied  to  the replacement  contract’s  specific  appropriation.  Amounts  recovered  that  exceed  the  actual costs of the replacement contract must be deposited as miscellaneous receipts. 14.20.  Unauthorized  Contractual  Commitments.  An  unauthorized  commitment  (e.g.,  an agreement that is not binding on the Government) is defined in the FAR, paragraph 1.602-3(a) as “an  agreement  that  is  not  binding  on  the  Government  because  the  employee  or  representative who  made  the  agreement  lacked  authority  to  enter  into  the  agreement.”    Authority  is  the officially  designated  or  earned  right  to  make  and  enforce  decisions.    In  other  words,  an unauthorized  commitment  is  an  act  by  an  employee  who  accepts  or  otherwise  commits  the government  to  pay  for  goods  or  services  without  authority.    An  unauthorized  commitment  is  a violation of the Antideficiency Act, punishable by both administrative and punitive means.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   105  14.20.1.  Authorities. 14.20.1.1.  Contracting  Officers  (CO)  hold  warrants  indicating  what  authority  and limitations  they  have,  e.g.,  a  CO’s  warrant  may  grant  him/her  authority  to  award contracts up to a set dollar threshold. 14.20.1.2.  Contracting  Officer  Representatives  (COR)  holds  limited  authority  via  an appointment (duties and responsibilities) letter issued by a CO. 14.20.1.3.  Apparent Authority exists where the principal's words or conduct would lead a reasonable  person  to  believe  that  the  agent  was  authorized  to  act  on  behalf  of  the government. 14.20.2.  To  become  binding,  an  unauthorized  commitment  must  be  ratified  (made  legally binding  and  enforceable).    Unauthorized  commitments  should  not  to  be taken  lightly;  there may  be  severe  consequences  for  all  parties  involved,  including  steep  fines  and  criminal penalties.  Not all unauthorized commitments are ratifiable. 14.20.3.  Ratification of Unauthorized Commitment. 14.20.3.1.  Ratification is  an  administrative  process  whereby  an  unauthorized commitment is converted into a legal contract, if approved.  COs cannot simply  issue a Purchase  Order  or  modify  a  contract  to  pay  an  unauthorized  commitment.    All unauthorized  commitments  are  subject  to  the  ratification  process,  irrespective  of  dollar amount. 14.20.3.2.  Unauthorized  Commitments  may  be  ratified  when  action  is  for  something legal,  funds  were  available  at  the  time  the  unauthorized  commitment  occurred  and  are still  available,  the  resulting  contract  would  otherwise  have  been  proper  if  made  by  an appropriate  CO,  the  CO  determines  the  price  to  be  fair  and  reasonable,  the  CO recommends  payment  and  Counsel  concurs  in  the  recommendation,  and  funding  is available and was available at the time the unauthorized commitment was made. 14.20.3.3.  When an unauthorized Commitment is made, immediately notify the CO, who in  turn  notifies  the  contractor  to  stop  work/performance.    The  individual  who  made  the unauthorized commitment initiates the ratification documentation.    106  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 15 DHP TRIANNUAL REVIEWS 15.1.  Triannual  Reviews  (TAR)  of  Commitments,  Obligations,  Accounts  Payable  and Accounts  Receivable.  Note:  AFMS organizations must conduct TARs per DoDFMR Volume 3,  Chapter  8,  paragraph  0804;  DFAS  7220.4-I,  Triannual  Review  Program;  and  SAF/FMP (AFAFO) guidance.   15.1.1.  Objective.    The  TAR  process  is  an  internal  control  practice  used  to  assess  whether commitments  and  obligations  recorded  are  bona  fide  needs  of  the  appropriations  charged.  The  TAR  entails  rigorous  assessment  of  commitments  and  obligations  of  appropriations  in order  to  adjudicate  their  disposition  before  the  funds  expire.  TARs  must  be  completed through analysis and review of all relevant financial records.  (T-0). 15.1.2.  TAR Approach.  Conducting the TAR is a team effort that involves the collaborative work  of  RMO,  cost  center  managers,  program  managers,  Medical  Logistics,  supporting Finance  offices,  and  supporting  CONS  offices.    Sound  financial  management  practices entails maintaining oversight of financial transactions throughout their lifecycle—through all stages of accounting—until the obligations are liquidated and/or funds are timely deobligated if  no  longer  needed.      RMOs  must  review  the  ODL  continually,  not  just  during  the  TAR process. 15.2.  TAR Periods Covered.  RMOs/RAs, with assistance from supporting accounting offices, are  mandated  to  review  dormant  commitments,  unliquidated  obligation,  accounts  payable  and accounts receivable transactions for timeliness, accuracy, and completeness during each of the 4-month  periods  ending  on  January  31  (October  through  January),  May  31  (February  through May),  and  September  30  (June  through  September)  of  each  fiscal  year.    When  conducting  the TARs,  RMOs/Resource  Advisors  must  abide  by  DFAS  7220.4-I,  Triannual  Review  Program, and SAF/FMP (AFAFO) guidance.  (T-0). 15.2.1.  TARs  provide  the  basis  for  the  confirmation  statements  and  the  annual  fiscal  year end  certification  of  appropriation  and  fund  balances  associated  with  year-end  closeout. Accurate  obligation  records  are  a  critical  factor  in  efforts  to  eliminate  unmatched disbursements  and  negative  unliquidated  obligations.  If  the  obligation  record  in  the  official accounting system is not fully accurate, the associated disbursements cannot be successfully matched  to  the  correct  obligation.  Incomplete  or  erroneous  obligation  and  commitment records increase the potential for ADA violations. 15.2.2.  TARs apply to all funds allotted/distributed to an installation fund holder, including direct and reimbursable funds. The reviews are performed to ensure unliquidated obligations are recorded,  are in  the proper  stage  of  accounting,  the  amounts  are  valid  and  correct,  they are not dormant, and that documentation exists to support the recording of the Unliquidated Obligations (ULO) and Commitments. 15.2.3.  The accounting office identifies dormant commitments and unliquidated obligations eligible  for  closeout  by  the  paying  office  as  contracts  that  are  physically  complete  and  for which the period of performance (POP) has expired (hereinafter, “dormant Contracts”).  For dormant  contracts,  which  have  been  physically  complete  for  12  months  or  more  and  have remaining funds of less than $1,000, the accounting office deobligates the funds based on a  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   107  written  consent  from  the  funds  holder  and contracting  officer.  It  is  the responsibility  of  the Contracting Officer to send notification to the Accounting Office, Program Office, and Funds Holder that a contract is complete and no further valid transactions will be forthcoming. This does  not  apply  to  dormant  contracts  administered  by  the  Defense  Contract  Management Agency (DCMA). 15.2.4.  Retention  of  Supporting  Documents.    Per  the  DoDFMR,  Volume  3,  Chapter  8, paragraph  080407,  Air  Force  organizations  are  required  to  keep  TAR  documentation, working  papers  and  electronic  files  for  a  period  of  24  months  after  the  close  of  the  TAR review for audit review. 15.2.4.1.  Any electronic documents used, such as those in Electronic Document Access (EDA),  Electronic  Document  Management  (EDM),  and  Automated  Business  Services System  (ABSS),  etc.,  do  not  have  to  be  converted  to  paper  documentation.  Document, either  by  electronic  means  (in  a  database  or  spreadsheet)  or  by  memorandum, conversations held with other parties and used to determine the validity of an obligation and retain that information as part of working papers. 15.2.4.2.  Documentation used to validate obligations and commitments will not be from the  accounting  system  (GAFS)  itself  or  any  other  Management  Information  System (MIS)  such  as  the  Commander’s  Resource  Information  System  (CRIS).  These  systems may be used to verify changes posted to the accounting system only. To properly validate an obligation, the source system must be used to verify that the accounting system is in balance with the originating system.  Source systems include (not limited to) ABSS and DMLSS. The documentation reviewed, as well as the system used should be part of the working papers kept for the review and be retained for at least 24 months. 15.2.4.3.  TAR Confirmation Statements.  Confirmation statements are used to document the  organizations’  due  diligence  in  performing  the  TAR.    MTFs  must  submit  a  copy  of every  confirmation  statement,  signed  by  the  unit  commander,  to  AFMOA/SGAR,  who will in turn submit a consolidated confirmation statement to AF/SGY.  AF/SGY provides a  consolidated  AFMS  confirmation  statement  to  the  DHA.    (T-1).    Non-MTF organizations that execute DHP funds must also perform TARs and submit confirmation statements.    (T-1).    Below  are  sample  confirmation  statements  for  use  by  MTFs  and AFMOA, respectively. Table 15.1.  MTF TAR Confirmation Statement.

Acceptable and Unacceptable TAR Remarks on Line Items. 15.3.1.  Acceptable.  Remarks must be of a nature that specifically explains what actions are required to liquidate the obligation, i.e. receiving report, invoice, etc. to process payment, the estimated liquidation date (based on input from vendor, DFAS, etc.), the name of the person performing  validation,  and  the  name  of  individuals  contacted  during  follow-up/research (including contact information). 15.3.2.  Unacceptable Comments.  Vague remarks are prohibited, such as simply stating “this obligation is valid” or “valid per Mr. Smith”. 15.4.  Deobligations.  Deobligations  are  downward  adjustments  of  previously obligations recorded 15.4.1.  The  rules  for  deobligation  follow  from  the  principles  required  for  obligation.  A proper unliquidated obligation is necessary when the standards for maintaining the obligation are no longer met. 15.4.2.  The  deobligation  of  funds  without  proper  substantiating  documentation  merely  to “free  up  funds”  for  new  obligations  is  not  authorized.  To  do  so  risks  committing  an  ADA violation. 15.4.3.  Funds  properly  deobligated  may  be  used  for  new  obligations  if  the  period  of availability for the funds has not expired. 15.4.4.  Funds deobligated after the expiration of the period of availability are available only for unrecorded obligations or within scope adjustments. 15.5.  Dormant  Obligations  Resulting  from  DMLSS  Transactions.  These  transactions  must be  reconciled  between  the  RMO  and  Medical  Logistics  offices.    It  is  a  joint  responsibility requiring  collaboration.    If  a  contract  modification  requires  a  deobligation  of  funds,  Medical Logistics will coordinate with  the relevant offices (e.g., CO and the end user) to  determine the exact  amount  to  be  deobligated.  Medical  Logistics  will  then  accomplish  all  necessary documentation,  and  provide  RMO  with  relevant  information  and  supporting  documents  so  that the RMO can update FMSuite.  (T-3).  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   113  Chapter 16 BUDGETING AND FUNDING GUIDANCE FOR VARIOUS PROGRAMS 16.1.  Information  Management/Information  Technology.  Although  a  full  certification  and accreditation (C&A) does not need to be accomplished before a medical system, application, or device  is  purchased,  the  requirements  surrounding  C&A  should  be  to  ensure  that  all  medical systems, applications, and devices are properly accredited before being placed on the Air Force network. 16.2.  Wireless Internet for Patients within the Medical Group.  DHP funding of commercial wireless internet is not permitted.  Although wireless internet serves a morale purpose, it is not a medical mission requirement. 16.3.  Professional Membership Fees (Military and Civilian).  Per AFI 65-601 V1, para 4.57., Air  Force  organizations  may  use  O&M  funds  to  pay  membership  fees  in  professional organizations  only  in  the  name  of  the  Air  Force  organization  and  only  if  the  membership  will benefit  the  organization‘s  mission.  Air  Force  activities  may  not  use  O&M  funds  to  pay  for membership fees which are in the name of an individual.   DHP funds may not be used to pay dues  or  fees  for  individual  memberships  in  professional  organizations.    Even  when  individual membership  is  required  before  taking  a  certification  exam  that  is  eligible  for  reimbursement, DHP may not be used to pay the prerequisite membership dues. 16.4.  Funding for Community Action Information Board and Integrated Delivery System (CAIB/IDS)  Activities.  Reference  AFI  90-501,  Community  Action  Information  Board  and Integrated Delivery System. 16.4.1.  The  CAIB  and  IDS  are  cross-functional  forums  and  as  such  do  not  have  assigned budgets.  Funding  for  cross-functional  initiatives  will  be  provided  by  the  participating agencies, and supplemented when needed by CAIB Chair resources. 16.4.2.  DHP funds may be used to support CAIB/IDS activities to the extent that the activity supports  the  medical  mission  (i.e.,  the  “purpose”  of  the  DHP  appropriation  must  be  met).  For example, DHP funds may be used toward Patient (Health) Education efforts specifically, but  not  to  fund  an  IDS  conference  that  includes  other  cross-functional  (non-medically related) elements. 16.4.3.  The  Family  Advocacy  Program  (FAP),  which  is  predominantly  funded  by  the Defense-wide appropriation (not DHP) is a key component of the CAIB/IDS.  FAP education initiatives  should  be  funded  using  monies  appropriated  to  the  FAP  for  education/outreach efforts.    In  addition,  on  30  Jan  2004,  the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Military Communities  and  Family  Policy  (OUSD(MC&FP))issued  a  memorandum  (Figure  16.1. below),  wherein  the  Military  Departments  are  authorized  to  use  Service  O&M  (i.e.,  LAF O&M) to augment the FAP program to meet unique requirements. 16.5.  Funding for Hypobaric and Hyperbaric Chambers. 16.5.1.  Hypobaric  Chambers.    The  Aerospace  &  Operational  Physiology  (AOP)  program encompasses four basic missions: U-2 physiological support, High-Altitude Airdrop Mission Support, human performance sustainment, and aircrew physiological training.  The first three missions  are  AF/SG  programs.    Aircrew  physiological  training  (which  includes  hypobaric    114  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 chambers and other physiological training systems) is a LAF program and is not funded with DHP. 16.5.1.1.  Support  of  AOP  personnel  remains  responsibility  of  unit  of  assignment.    If aligned  under  MTF,  medical  and  admin  supplies,  specialized  uniform  items  (e.g.  flight suits),  information  technology  systems,  etc.    If  aligned  under  LAF  organization,  these costs  become  LAF  responsibility.    Regardless  of  unit  of  assignment,  LAF  funds  all aspects system procurement/sustainment, aircrew flight equipment for students, gases, etc. IAW AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program. physiological systems, of aircrew training to include  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   115  Figure 16.1.  Memorandum from OUSD(MC&FP). 16.5.1.2.  The  AF/SG  provides  the  staffing  for  the  AP  program  (Aerospace  Physiology AFSCs).  The AFMS’ role is to provide the medical, technical, fiscal, and administrative supervision needed to carry out the training program itself (i.e. resources needed by the training staff such as funding for CME TDYs).       116  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 16.5.1.3.  Non-DoD  Hypobaric  Chamber  Use.    When  organizations  use  non-DoD hypobaric chambers, the user fees may not be funded with DHP. 16.5.2.  Hyperbaric  Chambers.    The  hyperbaric  chambers  are  for  clinical  treatment  (ex.  the one in Kadena is primarily used to treat recreational divers), and thus are DHP-funded. 16.6.  Use of DHP Supplemental Health Care Program Funds for Foreign Cadets Attending the Air Force Academy.  DHP supplemental care funds may be used for cadets appointed under the provisions of 10 USC §9344, whether or not reimbursement is waived by the SECDEF. 16.7.  Funding  for  Clothing  Destroyed  During  Medical  Care.  Refer  to  AFI  65-601  V1, Section 10I—Funding for Individual Clothing. 16.8.  Leased Housing for Military Graduate Medical Education (GME) Residents.  Refer to AFI 65-601 Vol 1, paragraph 10.25.16.  Leases are funded by the DHP. 16.9.  Publication of GME Research Articles in Professional Journals.  Refer to AFI 65-601 V1, paragraph 10.25.17. 16.10.  Health  Promotion  Incentive  Items.  Purchase  of  items  of  low  intrinsic  value,  such  as pens,  coffee  mugs,  key  chains,  luggage  tags,  buttons,  badges,  balloons,  Frisbees,  t-shirts,  or toothbrushes may be purchased if the item conveys an appropriate message intended to educate or  reinforce  health/wellness  programs.    Such  messages  may  relate  to  programs  such  as  breast cancer  screening,  smoking  cessation,  and  dental  hygiene  for  children.    Items  may  not  be personalized.  Coins may not be procured. 16.11.  Non-prescription  items.  Generally,  with  the  exception  of  Health  Promotion  items intended  to  educate  or  reinforce  health/wellness  programs,  non-prescription  items  (i.e., prevention items such as sunscreen, hand sanitizers, athletic braces/eye protection, etc.) are not procured with the DHP appropriation.  The purchase of hand sanitizer and tissue (i.e., Kleenex) for use by healthcare organizations/patients within MTFs, is permitted. 16.12.  Do not charge Transportation of Human Remains to the DHP.  Costs are covered by Mortuary Affairs (see AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program). 16.13.  Serving Materials for MTFs (plates, utensils, cups, etc.  ). MTFs are not authorized to use  appropriated  funds  to  purchase  serving  materials.    MTFs  may  borrow  materials  from  the clubs as may be required for a conference.  This does not apply to MTF dining facilities. 16.14.  Funding  for  Reserve  Officer  Training  Corps  (ROTC)  Injuries/Illness  Incurred  in Line  of  Duty  (LOD).  Expenses in  providing civilian/private  sector  hospitalization,  medical  and  surgical  care,  necessary  transportation incident to that hospitalization or medical and surgical care, or in connection with a funeral and burial on behalf of a member of, or applicant for membership in ROTC of the Army, Navy, or Air Force who suffers an injury, disability, or death incurred, or an illness contracted, in line of duty, shall be reimbursed by the Secretary of Labor from the Employees' Compensation Fund. incurred  by  any  military  department 16.14.1.  Reimbursement by the Department of Labor may not be made for hospitalization or medical or surgical care provided an individual at a military MTF.  MTFs may pursue Third Party billing if the individual has private health insurance. 16.14.2.  LOD includes – 16.14.2.1.  While engaged in a flight or in flight instruction under 10 USC §2109; or  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   117  16.14.2.2.  During  the period of the member's attendance at  training  or a practice cruise under  10  USC  §2109,  beginning  when  the  authorized  travel  to  the  training  or  practice cruise begins and ending when authorized travel from the training or practice cruise ends. 16.14.3.  Subject to review by the Secretary of Labor, the military department shall determine whether  an  injury,  disability,  or  death  was  incurred,  or  an  illness  was  contracted,  by  a member in line of duty.  (T-0). 16.14.4.  The military department shall cooperate fully with the Department of Labor in the prompt  investigation  and  prosecution  of  a  case  involving  the  legal  liability  of  a  third  party other than the United States.  (T-0). 16.14.5.  "Applicant for membership" includes a student enrolled, during a semester or other enrollment term, in a course which is part of Reserve Officers' Training Corps instruction at an educational institution. 16.15.  Checks  Received  from  Pharmaceutical  Companies.  Whenever  an  MTF  receives  a check from a pharmaceutical company (e.g., not the checks received from insurance companies or pay patients), the RMO must immediately notify Medical Logistics.  Those checks may NOT be  deposited  to  the  MTF’s  O&M  funds.    Rather,  they  must  be  deposited  to  the  Air  Force Working Capital Fund – Medical/Dental Division (AFWCF/MDD).  Reference AFI 41-209.  (T-1). 16.16.  AFMS Procurement (OP) Process. 16.16.1.  AF/SGY initiates an OP data call with the AF/SG5/SG6, AFMOA/SGAL, and the Health  Facilities  Office.    These  directorates/divisions  make  up  the  AFMS  Procurement Advisory Working Group (PAWG). 16.16.2.  The  PAWGs  initiate,  develop  and  forward  their  respective  directorate/division's procurement requirements to AF/SGY for review/coordination. 16.16.3.  AF/SGY de-conflicts any prior year requirements and consolidates the PAWGs’ OP requirements  into  one  procurement  spend  plan  and  forwards  back  to  the  PAWG  for  their prioritization. 16.16.4.  The PAWG reviews and discusses the consolidated list, prioritizes requirements and forwards back to SGYB an agreed upon consolidated/prioritized requirements list. 16.16.5.  AF/SGY prepares/coordinates this procurement spend plan through the MAJCOMs and AFMS Group for review/vote. 16.16.6.  Once the MAJCOMs and AFMS Group approves the spend plan, SGY coordinates the  procurement  spend  plan  through  the  AFMS  Council  for  review  and  approval,  in accordance with the AFMS Corporate Structure process. 16.16.7.  AF/SGY  forwards  the  approved  spend  plan  back  to  the  PAWG  as  the  official AFMS Procurement Spend Plan. 16.17.  Air Force Medical Research, Development and Evaluation (RDT&E) Requirements Process.  Approximately 6 months before POM submissions are due, the RMO should expect a data  call  from  the  MAJCOM  soliciting  inputs  on  capability  needs  requiring  research  and/or material solutions.  The window for modernization will usually close 120 days after the data call is announced.  However, a requirement may be submitted by the MTF to the Assistant Surgeon    118  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 General  Requirements  for  Operational  Capabilities  Council  (SGROCC)  any  time  by  accessing the AFMS Knowledge Exchange. 16.18.  Payment for Occupational Health Exams of Civil Service Employees.  Reference AFI 65-601 Vol 1, paragraph 10.26.17.  This guidance is provided to facilitate understanding of the payment  process  for  occupational  medical  examinations  that  exceed  local  Air  Force  MTF capabilities.    This  guidance  was  developed  in  collaboration  with  SAF/FMP,  SAF/FMP (AFAFO), SAF/FMBOP, SAF/FMBMM, SAF/AQCA, and AFMSA/SG3PF. 16.18.1.  Fitness  for  duty  examinations  (FFDEs)  and  medical  surveillance  examinations (MSE) shall be performed through an AF designated health care provider (HCP) at no cost to the employee.  (T-0). 16.18.2.  When  the  local  MTF  does  not  have  the  capability  to  provide  an  employer  (AF) required  medical  examination  (or  a  portion  of  the  exam)  that  the  AF  is  responsible  for providing free of charge to the employee, the AF may arrange to have the examination (lab tests,  etc.)  in  the  civilian  sector  (non-DoD)  healthcare  community  after  receiving authorization from the employee’s unit commander. 16.18.3.  The employee’s unit commander must also authorize payment for the examination.  (T-1).  Payment is made from the same appropriation that funds the employee’s salary.  The DHP  appropriation  may  not  be  used  for  the  examinations,  unless  the  employee’s  salary  is DHP-funded (e.g., an MTF employee). 16.18.4.  The  Installation  Occupational  Environmental  Medicine  Consultant  (IOEMC)  will provide clinical oversight of referrals/consults to ensure they are appropriate and justified. 16.18.5.  The MTF provider’s support staff notifies the MTF RMO that a private sector exam is  needed  for  a  civil  service  employee  (the  clinic  must  include  the  estimated  cost  of  the exam/test). 16.18.5.1.  The  RMO  sends  a  Request  for  Commander’s  Authorization  of  Payment  for Civilian  Medical  Exam  (Figure  16.2.)  packet  to  the  employee’s  Unit  Commander.    The packet  contains  two  attachments:  (1)  Commander’s  Authorization  of  Payment  for Civilian  Medical  Exam  (Figure  16.3.),  and  (2)  Instructions  to  Unit  Resource  Advisor (Figure 16.4). 16.18.5.1.1.  Commander’s  Authorization  of  Payment  for  Civilian  Medical  Exam.  This letter serves as the MTF’s authorization to schedule the employee’s referral.  It also  expresses  the  Commander’s  acknowledgement  that  his/her  unit’s  funds  will  be used for payment of the exam. 16.18.5.1.2.  Instructions to Unit Resource Advisor.  This information sheet explains to  the  employee’s  Unit  Resource  Advisor  the  steps  he/she  must  take  in  order  to  for payment  to  be  made  to  the  civilian  healthcare  provider.    Payment  will  not  be  made until exam results are received by the MTF.  (T-1). 16.18.5.2.  Once  the  RMO  receives  the  Commander’s  Authorization  of  Payment  for Civilian Medical Exam from the employee’s unit, a copy is provided to the MTF clinic.  The clinic may then schedule the employee's exam. 16.18.5.2.1.  The MTF clinic that schedules the employee’s exam must emphasize to the civilian sector provider’s office that results of the exam and the associated invoice  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   119  for  full  and  final  payment  must  be  sent  to  the  MTF’s  Referral  Management  Center (RMC).    Note:    Be  sure  to  provide  the  address,  FAX,  point  of  contact information.  This is required in order to avert HIPAA and PHI violations and to ensure the provider receives payment. 16.18.5.2.1.1.  The RMC will forward the exam results to the MTF provider that requested the exam and also forward the invoice for the exam to RMO. 16.18.5.2.1.2.  The RMO will: 16.18.5.2.1.2.1.  Verify  that  the  invoice  contains  “Full”  or  “Final”  payment on  the  invoice.    If  the  invoice  does  not  state  that  it  is  for  full/final  payment, then  RMO  must  contact  the  civilian  provider’s  billing  office  in  order  to receive a revised bill.  (T-1). 16.18.5.2.1.2.2.  Process  payment  according  to  the  option  indicated  by  the employee’s unit commander on the bottom of the Commander’s Authorization of  Payment  for  Civilian  Medical  Exam,  and  per  the  Instructions  to  the  Unit Resource Advisor. 16.18.5.2.1.2.3.  RMO  will  not  proceed  with  payment  until  exam  results  are received by the MTF.  (T-1). 16.19.  Retired  Pay,  Physical  or  Mental  Incapacitation  while  Inpatient.  Per  DoDFMR  Vol 7B, Chap 16, para 1607, the commanding officer of any military hospital or the director of a VA hospital may designate an officer under the command to receive and receipt for a sum of money from  the  accrued  pay  of  a  retiree  who,  as  a  patient  at  the  hospital,  has  been  found  to  be physically  or  mentally  incapacitated  in  a  report  of  medical  officers.  This  money  may  be  used only  for  the  purchase  of  comfort  items  for  the  use  and  benefit  of  that  retiree  when  all  of  the following conditions exist:  (a) A trustee has not been designated and a guardian or other legal representative has not been appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction. (b) There are no other funds available for use on behalf of the retiree. (c) Competent medical authority agrees that the items to be purchased will serve the comfort of the retiree. Figure 16.2.

The DoD is required to conduct ongoing assessments of compliance with federal financial management laws and regulations per the  Chief  Financial  Officer  Act  of  1990  and  subsequent  federal  financial  management legislation,  and  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  Circular  A-123,  Management’s Responsibility for Internal Control. 17.2.  FIAR Framework.  The AFMS is committed to improving internal controls and processes through  identifying  and  evaluating  any  risk  of  financial  material  misstatements,  designing  and implementing  control  activities  that  limit  the  risk  of  material  misstatements,  and  through supporting  financial  statements  with  sufficient  and  appropriate  evidentiary  documents  down  to the transaction level. 17.3.  Audit  Documentation in collaboration with DFAS prepares quarterly AFMS financial statements.  By law, these financial statements must be auditable.  When financial statements are audited, the underlying transactions that constitute the numbers reflected on the financial statement may be examined. to  Support  AFMS  Financial  Statements.  AF/SGY 17.3.1.  Audits  conducted  at  the  transaction  level  require  well-organized  supporting documentation (evidentiary matter) such as travel receipts, signed WAWF invoices, certified funding  documents,  signed  contracts,  signed  civilian  and  contractor  time  sheets,  well-maintained  contract  binders  and  MIPR  folders, thorough reimbursement  documents  (i.e.,  supporting  MSA,  MAC,  and  TPC  billed  and  collected amounts).    In  support  of  AFMS  audit  readiness,  MTFs  must  assure  these  documents  are audit-ready, and available on short notice, at all times. thorough  GPC  records, 17.3.2.  Business  Processes.    In  addition  to  being  able  to  produce  all  required  audit documentation on short notice, MTFs must be able to demonstrate sound business processes.  For example: 17.3.2.1.  Does  the  person  who  signs  the  WAWF  invoice  actually  know  the  goods  and services  were  received?    How?    Are  contractor  invoices  and  contractor  timesheets validated prior to approving  invoices for payment?  Do the dollar  amounts on contracts awarded match the obligation amounts in CRIS?  Based on the amounts viewed in AEP, did DFAS pay the contractor the amount that the MTF certified for payment? 17.3.2.2.  Do  TDY  voucher  approvers  ascertain  that  all  required  receipts  are  included with the travel voucher before approving it for payment?  Are DD Form 577’s maintained for individual authorized to approve TDY orders and vouchers? 17.3.2.3.  Do  civilian  timesheets  appropriately  reflect  civilian  time-off  requests  and holidays? 17.3.2.4.  Are  certified  MIPRs  reconciled  with  invoices  charged  to  the  MIPR?    Are  the invoices on file?  Is the MIPR acceptance on file? 17.3.2.5.  Are GPC binders well-organized to include filing the monthly bank statements together with all associated receipts?    124  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 17.4.  A-123  Testing.  OMB  Circular  A-123  defines  responsibilities  for  internal  control  within Federal agencies.  AF/SGY periodically tests financial internal controls through internal reviews.  SGY internal reviews serve multiple purposes, for example, it is the AFMS CFO’s responsibility to test whether internal controls are sufficiently robust to mitigate fraud, waste, abuse or material financial misstatements; to prepare the AFMS for financial statement audits; to identify financial improvement  opportunities;  to  identify  gaps  in  policies,  procedures  and  RMO  training;  and  to identify best practices. 17.4.1.  A-123 Testing Focus.  Focus areas for FIAR assessments are directed by OUSD(C).  Generally,  the  assessments  focus  on  programs  and  business  processes  that  represent appropriations  received,  collections  and  disbursements  reflected  on  AFMS  financial statements.  For example, assessments would entail reviews of budget authority, contracts for supplies  and  services,  MIPRS,  patient  and  staff  travel,  civilian  pay,  GPC  purchases,  and Uniform Business Office programs (MSA, MAC, and TPC). 17.4.2.  A-123  Test  Samples.    Prior  to  A-123  internal  review  team  site  visits  by  AF/SGY, which are sometimes referred to as “FIAR reviews” or “FIAR audits,” the MTF is provided a list  of  “sample”  transactions  that  are  intended  to  be  random,  representative  transactions  for each  of  the  aforementioned  focus  areas.    The  SGY  internal  review  team  concentrates  its efforts  on  reviewing  all  documents  and  business  processes  that  support  these  sample transactions to determine the overall compliance levels of each program sampled. 17.4.3.  A-123 Test Attributes.  For each of the focus areas, auditors will seek to affirm the presence  of  “key  controls”  through  pre-determined  program  test  “attributes.”    Most  test attributes  can  be  posed  as  objective  “yes”  or  “no”  questions.    For  example,  for  a  WAWF transaction,  one  test  attribute  may  question,  “Was  the  invoice  approved  by  an  authorized official within seven days of receipt?”  If the answer is “yes,” the attribute is met.  Though AF/SGY may occasionally update the test attributes to improve A-123 testing efforts, the test attributes  selected  will  always  aim  to  verify  the  organization  has  strong  internal  controls  in place  to  avoid  fraud,  waste  and  abuse,  and  to  avoid  material  misstatements  on  financial reports. 17.4.4.  Toward  that  end  and  to  compel  the  AFMS’  audit  readiness  posture,  the  audit elements  explained  in  paragraph  17  5  (Focus  Areas)  will  be  available  within  the Manager’s Internal Control Tool (MICT) in the form of a self-assessment checklist. 17.4.4.1.  FIAR  self-inspections  using  this  checklist  will  be  conducted  quarterly  (at  the end of each quarter).  (T-1).  This requirement may only be waived by AF/SGY. 17.4.4.2.  For  each  of  the  focus  areas  listed  (nine  total),  you  will  need  a  Selective Transaction  History  (STH)  from  CRIS  along  with  supporting  documents  for  each transaction selected for the review.  Please refer the sample CRIS queries located under the FIAR section of the Medical Fiscal Policy Knowledge Exchange website, or consult an experienced budget analyst who can assist with obtaining the CRIS reports needed. 17.4.4.3.  Once  you  have  the  CRIS  reports  you’ll  need to  identify  which  transactions  to review for the self-inspection.  For each focus area: 17.4.4.3.1.  Select the top 2 transactions with the highest dollar values 17.4.4.3.2.  Select the bottom 1 transaction with the lowest dollar value  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   125  17.4.4.3.3.  Select 2 transactions from the middle-range of the report 17.4.4.4.  In total, you should have selected 5 transactions to review for each focus area.  On  the  CRIS  reports,  highlight  those  transactions  you’ve  selected  for  the  review.    You will  need  to  attach  the  CRIS  report  with  the  highlighted  transactions  to  the  completed checklist, and retain both on file. 17.4.4.5.  Occasionally  there  may  not  be  5  transactions  for  review  in  each  focus  area (e.g., no transactions have occurred, so there are none or fewer than 5 to review).  If there are less than 5, then review what you do have.  If there are no transactions, then annotate it on the checklist. 17.4.4.6.  The  completed  &  signed  self-inspection  checklists  (with  the  corresponding CRIS  reports  containing  the  highlighted  transactions  that  were  reviewed)  should  be maintained in the RMO’s office and be available for review by external reviewers upon request.  Retain the documents for two (2) Fiscal Years. 17.5.  Focus Areas.  The subsequent paragraphs identify areas on which heightened attention to detail is required due to the nature of the transactions and their susceptibility to fraud, waste, and abuse,  and  the  necessity  to  minimize  the  risk  of  material  financial  misstatements.    The  audit elements  explained  below  are  available  within  the  MICT  in  the  form  of  self-inspection checklists.  The checklists may be modified based on noted audit and AF/SGY FIAR assessment trends in order to strengthen internal controls and auditability. 17.5.1.  Budget  Authority.    The  purpose  of  this  focus  area  is  simply  to  verify  that  the organization’s budget authority is accurately posted in the financial system.  Budget authority is transmitted via PBAS.  A Funds Authorization Document (FAD) is generated from PBAS and sent to the MTF/organization along with a “cut-sheet.” 17.5.1.1.  Organizations  that  execute  or  distribute  Defense  Health  Program  (DHP) appropriations (i.e., AF/SGY, AFMOA/SGAR, MTF RMOs) retain copies of all Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) on file for 6 years and 3 months. 17.5.1.2.  For each funding document received (or for a sample based on the number of documents received) verify each funding document is recorded in the accounting system at the correct amount, valid document ID, appropriation, fund type, years of availability, and reporting entity. If the values do not agree, investigate and resolve the differences. 17.5.1.3.  Verify  each  funding  line  loaded  in  the  accounting  system  is  traceable  to supporting  documentation  maintained  by  the  organization  such  as  the  AF  Form  1269, Request for Load or Change in Fund Targets or equivalent, at the detailed level and the FAD at the summary level. All budget authority loaded in the accounting system must be supported by the appropriate funding documentation. 17.5.2.  Contracts.    Tracking  financial  events  completely  through  the  lifecycle  of  a contract process  provides  commanders  with  valuable  information  to  make  informed  decisions  on maximizing  their  resources.    To  support  audit  readiness,  each  organization  must  maintain oversight  of  and  access  to  documentation  that  supports  the  obligation  and  expenditure throughout the contract’s lifecycle. 17.5.2.1.  “Samples”  for  this  focus  area  are  drawn  from  contract  payments  reflected  on AFMS financial records.  It is vital that signed contracts and modifications, and that all    126  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014 four  pages  of  the  WAWF  2-in-1  receiving  report  are  available.    Auditors  will  typically want to: 17.5.2.1.1.  Verify  contracts  are  supported  by  legally  executed,  written  documentary evidence  (a  contract  signed  by  an  authorized  Government  agent,  i.e.,  a  warranted Contracting Officer, along with a certified Purchase Request signed by an authorized official).  Ref:  DoDFMR V3, Chap 8, para 080302; and V5, Chap 11, para 110202. 17.5.2.1.2.  Obligations  must  be  recorded  accurately  based  on  the  amount  stated  on the contract/modification, to the appropriate line of accounting as determined by the RMO.    RMOs  must  verify  that  DFAS  posts  each  contract  accurately  and  timely (DFAS should posts obligations within 10 calendar days of the contract/modification being signed (reference DoDFMR V3, Chap 8, para 080301(A). 17.5.2.1.3.  A process exists to verify the goods or services invoiced are accepted by an authorized official (government personnel who are in a position to know whether goods/services were actually received per contractual requirements). 17.5.2.1.4.  Receiving Reports  (DD Form 250 or Invoice 2-in-1) are received by an authorized  official,  validated  for  accuracy  (rates/contract  terms),  and  are  timely submitted to DFAS for payment. 17.5.2.1.5.  Verify  that  all  disbursements  (AEP)  are  recorded  accurately  and  reflect the correct Line of Accounting (as stated on the contract/modification). 17.5.2.1.6.  Verify  that  if  a  prompt  payment  discount  is  offered  on  the  contract  or invoice, determine if DFAS applied it to the transaction.  Ref: DoDFMR V10, Chap 7, para 070207(A). 17.5.2.1.7.  Verify Tri-Annual Reviews are properly conducted.  Ref: DoDFMR V3, Chap 8, para 0804 (i.e., Tri-Annual Reviews), and DFAS 7220.4-I, Triannual Review Program. 17.5.3.  MIPRs.    Samples  for  this  focus  area  are  drawn  from  MIPR  entries  in  AFMS accounting system records. 17.5.3.1.  For this program, auditors typically focus on, reviewing the MIPRs for proper line  of  accounting,  verifying  funds  for  the  MIPR  were  certified  by  base  finance, comparing dollar amounts on MIPRs to obligation amounts in the accounting system for accuracy  and  understanding  the  organization’s  processes  for  validating  goods  and services paid for with MIPRs. 17.5.3.1.1.  Verify  that  the  Base  Accounting  and  Finance  Office  has  certified  that funds are available and that funds are committed. 17.5.3.1.2.  Verify  that  DFAS  obligates  funds  per  the  amounts  reflected  on  the  DD Form 448-2, MIPR Acceptance for Reimbursable (Cat I) MIPRs, or using the contract for direct cite (Cat II) MIPRs. 17.5.3.1.3.  Ensure  a  process  exists  to  verify  the  goods  or  services  invoiced  are reviewed  and  accepted  by  government  personnel  who  are  in  a  position  to  know whether goods/services were actually received per MIPR/contractual requirements.  AFMAN41-120  6 NOVEMBER 2014   127  17.5.3.1.4.  Ensure  that  invoiced  amounts  are  properly  reflected  in  the  accounting system. 17.5.3.1.5.  Verify  that  invoiced  amounts  are  charged    to  the  proper  Line  of Accounting (reflected on the MIPR). 17.5.3.1.6.  Verify  that  payments  are  supported  by  approved  invoices  and  that invoices are on file together with a certified copy of the MIPR and MIPR acceptance form (DD Form 448-2). 17.5.3.1.7.
