Navigation Publications. Aviators use air navigation to determine where they're going and how toget there. This pamphlet serves as a reference for techniques and methods used in air navigation.1.1.1.  In  addition  to  this  pamphlet,  several  other  sources  provide  excellent  references  to  methods  andtechniques of navigation. These sources include:1.1.1.1. Journal  of  The Institute of  Navigation.  This  journal  is  published  quarterly  by  The  Institute  ofNavigation, 1800 Diagonal Road, Alexandria VA 22314, and covers the latest in navigation technology.1.1.1.2. These United States Observatory and US Navy Oceanographic Office publications:1.1.1.2.1. Air Almanac.1.1.1.2.2. Nautical Almanac.1.1.1.2.3. NV Pub 9 (Volumes 1 and 2), The American Practical Navigator.1.1.1.2.4. SR Pub 249, Volumes 1 through 3, Sight Reduction Tables for Air Navigation.1.1.1.3.  Catalog,  NIMA  Public  Sale  Aeronautical  Charts  and  Products,  published  by  the  NationalImagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA).1.2. Basic Terms. Basic to the study of navigation is an understanding of certain terms which could becalled the dimensions of navigation. The navigator uses these dimensions of position, direction, distance,altitude,  and  time  as  basic  references.  A  clear  understanding  of  these  dimensions  as  they  relate  tonavigation  is  necessary  to  provide  the  navigator  with  a  means  of  expressing  and  accomplishing  thepractical aspects of air navigation. These terms are defined as follows:1.2.1. Position. A point defined by stated or implied coordinates. Though frequently qualified by suchadjectives as estimated, dead reckoning (DR), no wind, and so forth, the word position always refers tosome place that can be identified. It is obvious that a navigator must know the aircraft's current positionbefore being able to direct the aircraft to another position or in another direction.1.2.2. Direction. The position of one point in space relative to another without reference to the distancebetween them. Direction is not in itself an angle, but it is often measured in terms of its angular distancefrom a referenced direction.1.2.3.  Distance.  The  spatial  separation  between  two  points,  measured  by  the  length  of  a  line  joiningthem. On a plane surface, this is a simple problem. However, consider distance on a sphere, where theseparation  between  points  may  be  expressed  as  a  variety  of  curves.  It  is  essential  that  the  navigator20AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001decide exactly how the distance is to be measured. The length of the line can be expressed in variousunits; for example, nautical miles (NM) or yards.1.2.4. Altitude. The height of an aircraft above a reference plane. Altitude can be measured as absoluteor pressure. Absolute altitude is measured by a radar altimeter, and pressure altitude is measured fromvarious  datum  planes.  Compare  with  elevation,  which  is  the  height  of  a  point  or  feature  on  the  earthabove a reference plane.1.2.5. Time. Defined in many ways, but definitions used in navigation consist mainly of: (l) the hour ofthe day and (2) an elapsed interval.1.2.6.  Methods  of  Expression.  The  methods  of  expressing  position,  direction,  distance,  altitude,  andtime are covered fully in appropriate chapters. These terms, and others similar to them, represent definitequantities or conditions which may be measured in several different ways. For example, the position ofan aircraft may be expressed in coordinates such as a certain latitude and longitude. The position mayalso  be  expressed  as  10  miles  south  of  a  certain  city.  The  study  of  navigation  demands  the  navigatorlearn how to measure quantities such as those just defined and how to apply the units by which they areexpressed.Section 1B— The Earth1.3.  Shape  and  Size.  For  most  navigational  purposes,  the  earth  is  assumed  to  be  a  perfect  sphere,although  in  reality  it  is  not.  Inspection  of  the  earth's  crust  reveals  there  is  a  height  variation  ofapproximately 12 miles from the top of the tallest mountain to the bottom of the deepest point in theocean. A more significant deviation from "round" is caused by a combination of the earth's rotation andits structural flexibility. When you take the ellipsoidal shape of the planet into account, mountains seemrather insignificant. The peaks of the Andes are much farther from the center of the earth than MountEverest.1.3.1. Measured at the equator, the earth is approximately 6,378,137 meters in diameter, while the polardiameter  is  approximately  6,356,752.3142  meters.  The  difference  in  these  diameters  is  21,384.6858meters,  and  this  difference  may  be  used  to  express  the  ellipticity  of  the  earth.  The  ratio  between  thisdifference and the equatorial diameter is:1.3.2. Since the equatorial diameter exceeds the polar diameter by only 1 part in 298, the earth is nearlyspherical. A symmetrical body having the same dimensions as the earth, but with a smooth surface, iscalled an ellipsoid. The ellipsoid is sometimes described as a spheroid, or an oblate spheroid.1.3.3. In Figure 1.1, Pn, E, Ps, and W represent the surface of the earth, and Pn-Ps represents the axis ofrotation. The earth rotates from W to E. All points in the hemisphere Pn, W,  Ps  approach  the  reader,while  those  in  the  opposite  hemisphere  recede  from  the  reader.  The  circumference  W-E  is  called  theequator, which is defined as that imaginary circle on the surface of the earth whose plane passes throughthe center of the earth and is perpendicular to the axis of rotation.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200121Figure 1.1. Schematic Representation of the Earth Showing Axis of Rotation and Equator.1.4. Great Circles and Small Circles. A great circle is defined as a circle on the surface of a spherewhose center and radius are those of the sphere itself. It is the largest circle that can be drawn on thesphere; it is the intersection with the surface of the earth of any plane passing through the earth's center.1.4.1. The arc of a great circle is the shortest distance between two points on a sphere, just as a straightline is the shortest distance between two points on a plane. On any sphere, an indefinitely large numberof great circles may be drawn through any point, though only one great circle may be drawn through anytwo points not diametrically opposite. Several great circles are shown in Figure 1.2.1.4.2. Circles on  the  surface  of  the  sphere  other  than  great  circles  may  be  defined  as  small  circles.  Asmall circle is a circle on the surface of the earth whose center and/or radius are not that of the sphere. Aset of small circles, called latitude, is discussed later.1.4.3. In summary, the intersection of a sphere and a plane is a great circle if the plane passes through thecenter of the sphere and a small circle if it does not.1.5. Latitude and Longitude. The nature of a sphere is such that any point on it is exactly like any otherpoint. There is neither beginning nor ending as far as differentiation of points is concerned. In order thatpoints may be located on the earth, some points or lines of reference are necessary so that other pointsmay be located with regard to them. The location of New York City with reference to Washington DCcan be stated as a number of miles in a certain direction from Washington. Any point on the earth can belocated in this manner.1.5.1. Imaginary Reference Lines. Such a system, however, does not lend itself readily to navigation,because  it  would  be  difficult  to  locate  a  point  precisely  in  midocean  without  any  nearby  geographic22AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001features to use for reference. We use a system of coordinates to locate positions on the earth by means ofimaginary reference lines. These lines are known as parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude.Figure 1.2. A Great Circle Is the Largest Circle in a Sphere.1.5.2.  Latitude.  Once  a  day,  the  earth  rotates  on  its  north-south  axis  which  is  terminated  by  the  twopoles. The equatorial plane is constructed at the midpoint of this axis at right angles to it (Figure 1.3). Agreat circle drawn through the poles is called a meridian, and an infinite number of great circles may beconstructed in this manner. Each meridian is divided into four quadrants by the equator and the poles.The circle is arbitrarily divided into 360o, and each of these quadrants contains 90o.1.5.2.1. Take a point on one of these meridians 30o N of the equator. Through this point passes a planeperpendicular to the north-south axis of rotation. This plane will be parallel to the plane of the equator asshown in Figure 1.3 and will intersect the earth in a small circle called a parallel or parallel of latitude.The particular parallel of latitude chosen as 30o N and every point on this parallel will be at 30o N. In thesame way, other parallels can be constructed at any desired latitude, such as 10o, 40o, etc.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 1.3. Planes of the Earth.231.5.2.2. Bear in mind that the equator is drawn as the great circle midway between the poles and parallelsof latitude are small circles constructed with reference to the equator. The angular distance measured ona meridian north or south of the equator is known as latitude (Figure 1.4) and forms one component ofthe coordinate system.Figure 1.4. Latitude as an Angular Measurement.1.5.3. Longitude. The latitude of a point can be shown as 20o N or 20o S of the equator, but there is noway of knowing whether one point is east or west of another. This difficulty is resolved by use of theother  component  of  the  coordinate  system,  longitude,  which  is  the  measurement  of  this  east-westdistance. Longitude, unlike latitude, has no natural starting point for numbering. The solution has been toselect an arbitrary starting point. A great many places have been used, but when the English-speaking24AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001people began to make charts, they chose the meridian through their principal observatory in Greenwich,England, as the origin for counting longitude. This Greenwich meridian is sometimes called the primemeridian, though actually it is the zero meridian. Longitude is counted east and west from this meridianthrough 180o, as shown in Figure 1.5. Thus, the Greenwich meridian is the 0o longitude on one side ofthe  earth  and,  after  crossing  the  poles,  it  becomes  the  180th  meridian  (180o  east  or  west  of  the  0omeridian).Figure 1.5. Longitude Is Measured East and West of Greenwich Meridian.1.5.4.  Summary.  In  summary,  if  a  globe  has  the  circles  of  latitude  and  longitude  drawn  upon  itaccording to the principles described, any point can be located on the globe using these measurements(Figure 1.6).Figure 1.6. Latitude Is Measured From the Equator; Longitude From the Prime Meridian.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001251.5.4.1.  It  is  beneficial  to  point  out  here  some  of  the  measurements  used  in  the  coordinate  system.Latitude  is  measured  in  degrees  up  to  90,  and  longitude  is  expressed  in  degrees  up  to  180.  The  totalnumber of degrees in any one circle is always 360. A degree (o) of arc may be subdivided into smallerunits by dividing each degree into 60 minutes (') of arc. Each minute may be further subdivided into 60seconds (") of arc. Measurement may also be expressed in degrees, minutes, and tenths of minutes.1.5.4.2. A position on the surface of the earth is expressed in terms of latitude and longitude. Latitude isexpressed as being either north or south of the equator, and longitude as either east or west of the primemeridian.1.5.4.3. In actual practice, map production requires surveyors to measure the latitude and longitude ofgeographic objects in their area of  interest.  Local  variation  in  the  earth's  gravity  field  can  cause  thesemeasurements  to  be  inconsistent.  All  coordinates  from  maps,  charts,  traditional  surveys,  and  satellitepositioning  systems  are  thus  tied  to  an  individual  mathematical  model  of  the  earth  called  a  datum.Coordinates for a given point may differ between datums by hundreds of yards. In other words, latitudeand  longitude  measured  directly  from  observation  of  stars  (called  an  astronomic  coordinate)  will  beconsistent, but it may not match maps, charts, or surveyed points. The theoretical consistency of latitudeand longitude is therefore not achievable in reality. Without knowledge of the datum used to establish aparticular map or surveyed coordinate, the coordinate is suspect at best.1.6. Distance. Distance, as previously defined, is measured by the length of a line joining two points.The standard unit of distance for navigation is the nautical mile (NM). The nautical mile can be definedas either 6,076 feet or 1 minute of latitude.1.6.1.  Sometimes  it  is  necessary  to  convert  statute  miles  to  nautical  miles  and  vice  versa.  Thisconversion is easily done with the following ratio:1.6.2.  Closely  related  to  the  concept  of  distance  is  speed,  which  determines  the  rate  of  change  ofposition. Speed is usually expressed in miles per hour, this being either statute miles per hour or NM perhour. If the measure of distance is NM, it is customary to speak of speed in terms of knots. Thus, a speedof 200 knots and a speed of 200 NM per hour are the same thing. It is incorrect to say 200 knots per hourunless referring to acceleration.1.7.  Direction.  Remember,  direction  is  the  position  of  one  point  in  space  relative  to  another  withoutreference  to  the  distance  between  them.  The  time-honored  point  system  for  specifying  a  direction  asnorth, north-northwest, northwest, west-northwest, west, etc., is not adequate for modern navigation. Ithas been replaced for most purposes by a numerical system. The numerical system (Figure 1.7) dividesthe  horizon  into  360o,  starting  with  north  as  000o  and  continuing  clockwise  through  east  090o,  south180o, west 270o, and back to north.1.7.1.  The  circle,  called  a  compass  rose,  represents  the  horizon  divided  into  360o.  The  nearly  verticallines  in  the  illustration  are  meridians  drawn  as  straight  lines  with  the  meridian  of  position  A  passingthrough  000o  and  180o  of  the  compass  rose.  Position  B  lies  at  a  true  direction  of  062o  from  A,  andposition C is at a true direction of 220o from A.26AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 1.7. Numerical System Is Used in Air Navigation.1.7.2. Since determination of direction is one of the most important parts of the navigator's work,  thevarious terms involved should be clearly understood. Generally, in navigation, unless otherwise stated,directions are called true directions.1.7.3. Course is the intended horizontal direction of travel. Heading is the horizontal direction in whichan  aircraft  is  pointed.  Heading  is  the  actual  orientation  of  the  longitudinal  axis  of  the  aircraft  at  anyinstant, while course is the direction intended to be made good. Track is the actual horizontal directionmade by the aircraft over the earth.Figure 1.8. Measuring True Bearing From True North.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001271.7.4. Bearing is the horizontal direction of one terrestrial point from another. As illustrated in Figure1.8, the direction of the island from the aircraft  is  marked  by  a  visual  bearing  called  the  line  of  sight(LOS). Bearings are usually expressed in terms of one of two reference directions: (1) true north (TN) or(2) the direction in which the aircraft is pointed. If TN is the reference direction, the bearing is called atrue bearing (TB). If the reference direction is the heading of the aircraft, the bearing is called a relativebearing (RB) as shown in Figure 1.9.Figure 1.9. Measuring Relative Bearing From Aircraft Heading.1.8. Great Circle and Rhumb Line Direction. The direction of the great circle, shown in Figure 1.10,makes an angle of about 40o with the meridian near Washington, DC , about 85o with the meridian nearIceland, and a still greater angle with  the  meridian  near  Moscow.  In  other  words,  the  direction  of  thegreat circle is constantly changing as progress is made along the route, and is  different  at  every  pointalong the great circle. Flying such a route requires constant change of direction and would be difficult tofly  under  ordinary  conditions.  Still,  it  is  the  most  desirable  route  because  it  is  the  shortest  distancebetween any two points.Figure 1.10. Great Circle.28AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011.8.1. A line that makes the same angle with each meridian is called a rhumb line. An aircraft holding aconstant true heading would be flying a rhumb line. Flying this sort of path results in a greater distancetraveled, but it is easier to steer. If continued, a rhumb line spirals toward the poles in a constant truedirection but never reaches them. The spiral formed is called a loxodrome or loxodromic curve as shownin Figure 1.11.Figure 1.11. A Rhumb Line or Loxodrome.1.8.2. Between two points on the earth, the great circle is shorter than the rhumb line, but the differenceis negligible for short distances (except in high latitudes) or if the line approximates a meridian or theequator.Section 1C— Time1.9. Introduction. In celestial navigation, navigators determine the aircraft's position by observing thecelestial  bodies.  The  apparent  position  of  these  bodies  changes  with  time.  Therefore,  determining  theaircraft's position relies on timing the observation exactly. We measure time by the rotation of the earthand  the  resulting  apparent  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies.  This  chapter  considers  several  differentsystems of measurement, each with a special use. Before you learn the various kinds of time, you mustunderstand transit. Notice in Figure 1.12 that the poles divide the observer's meridian into halves. Theobserver's position is in the upper branch. The lower branch is the opposite half. Every day, because ofthe earth's rotation, every celestial body transits the upper and lower branches of the observer's meridian.The first kind of time presented here is solar time.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200129Figure 1.12. Transit Is Caused by the Earth's Rotation.1.10. Apparent Solar Time. The sun as you see it in the sky is called the true sun or the apparent sun.Apparent solar time is based upon the movement of the sun as it crosses the sky. A sundial accuratelyindicates apparent solar time. Apparent solar time isn't useful because the apparent length of day variesthroughout the year. A timepiece would have to operate at different speeds to indicate correct apparenttime. However, apparent time accurately indicates upper and lower transit. Upper transit occurs at noon;apparent time and lower transit at midnight apparent time. Difficulties in using apparent time led to theintroduction of mean time.1.11. Mean Solar Time. A mean day is an artificial unit of constant length, based on the average of allapparent solar days over a period of years. Time for a mean day is measured with reference to a fictitiousbody, the mean sun, so designed that its hour circle moves westward at a constant rate along the celestialequator.  Time  computed  using  the  mean  sun  is  called  mean  solar  time.  The  coordinates  of  celestialbodies in the  Air Almanac are tabulated in mean solar time, making  it  the  time  of  primary  interest  tonavigators. The difference in length between the apparent day (based upon the true sun) and the meanday (based upon the mean sun) is never as much as a minute. The differences are cumulative, however,so that the imaginary mean sun  precedes  or  follows  the  apparent  sun  by  approximately  15  minutes  atcertain times during the year.1.12.  Greenwich  Mean  Time  (GMT).  GMT  is  used  for  most  celestial  computations.  GMT  is  meansolar  time  measured  from  the  lower  branch  of  the  Greenwich  meridian  westward  through  360o  to  theupper branch of the hour circle passing through the mean sun (Figure 1.13). The mean sun transits theGreenwich meridian's lower branch at GMT 2400 (0000) each day and the upper branch at GMT 1200.The  meridian  at  Greenwich  is  the  logical  selection  for  this  reference,  as  it  is  the  origin  for  themeasurement of Greenwich hour angle (GHA) and the reckoning of longitude. Consequently, celestialcoordinates and other information are tabulated in almanacs with reference to GMT. GMT is also calledZulu or Z time.30AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 1.13. Measuring Greenwich Mean Time.1.13.  Local  Mean  Time  (LMT).  Just  as  GMT  is  mean  solar  time  measured  with  reference  to  theGreenwich meridian, LMT is mean solar time measured with reference to the observer's meridian. LMTis  measured  from  the  lower  branch  of  the  observers  meridian,  westward  through  360o,  to  the  upperbranch of the hour circle passing through the mean sun (Figure 1.13). The mean sun transits the lowerbranch  of  the  observer's  meridian  at  LMT  0000  (2400)  and  the  upper  branch  at  LMT  1200.  For  anobserver  at  the  Greenwich  meridian,  GMT  is  LMT.  Navigators  use  LMT  to  compute  local  sunrise,sunset, twilight, moonrise, and moonset at various latitudes along a given meridian.Section 1D— Relationship of Time and Longitude1.14. Introduction. The mean sun travels at a constant rate, covering 360o of arc in 24 hours. The meansun transits the same meridian twice in 24 hours. The following relationships exists between time andarc:Time24 hours1 hour4 minutes1 minuteArc360o15o1o15'1.14.1. Local time is the time at one particular meridian. Since the sun cannot transit two meridianssimultaneously, no two meridians have exactly the same local time. The difference in time between twomeridians is the time of the sun's passage from one meridian to the other. This time is proportional to theangular distance between the two meridians. One hour is equivalent to 15o.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001311.14.2. If two meridians are 30o apart, their time differs by 2 hours. The easternmost meridian has a laterlocal  time  because  the  sun  has  crossed  its  lower  branch  first;  thus,  the  day  is  older  there.  Thesestatements hold true whether referring to the  apparent  sun  or  the  mean  sun.  Figure  1.14  demonstratesthat the sun crossed the lower branch of the meridian of observer # 1 at 60o east longitude 4 hours beforeit crossed the lower branch of the Greenwich meridian (60 divided by 15) and 6 hours before it crossedthe lower branch of the meridian of observer #2 at 30o west longitude (90 divided by 15). Therefore, thelocal time at 60o east longitude is later by the respective amounts.Figure 1.14. Local Time Differences at Different Longitudes.1.15. Standard Time Zone. The world is divided into 24 zones, each zone being 15o of longitude wide.Each zone uses the LMT of its central meridian. (A few areas of the world are further divided and usehalf hour increments from GMT. Some notable examples include India, Bangladesh, Newfoundland, andparts of Australia and Thailand.) Since the Greenwich meridian  is  the  central  meridian  for  one  of  thezones  and  each  zone  is  15o  or  1  hour  wide,  the  time  in  each  zone  differs  from  GMT  by  an  integralnumber of hours. The zones are designated by numbers from 0 to 12 and -12, each indicating the numberof hours that must be added or subtracted to local zone time (LZT) to obtain GMT. Since the time isearlier  in  the  zones  west  of  Greenwich,  the  numbers  of  these  zones  are  plus;  in  those  zones  east  ofGreenwich, the numbers are minus (Figure 1.15). Ground forces frequently refer to the zones by lettersof  the  alphabet,  and  air  forces  use  one  of  these  letters  (Z)  for  GMT.  The  zone  boundaries  have  beenmodified to conform with geographical boundaries for greater convenience. For example, in case a zoneboundary passed through a city, it would be impractical to use the time of one zone in one part of the cityand the time of the adjacent zone in the other part. In some countries, which overlap two or three zones,one time is used throughout.1.16. Date Changes at Midnight. If you travelled west from Greenwich around the world and set yourwatch  back  an  hour  for  each  time  zone,  you  would  have  set  your  watch  back  a  total  of  24  hours  onarriving  back  at  Greenwich  and  the  date  would  be  1  day  behind.  Conversely,  traveling  eastward,  thewatch would have been advanced a total of 24 hours, gaining a day.32AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 1.15. Standard Time Zones.1.16.1. To keep straight, you must add a day somewhere if going around the world to the west and tolose  a  day  if  going  around  to  the  east.  The  180o  meridian  is  the  international  dateline  where  a  day  isgained or lost. The date line follows the meridian except where it detours to avoid eastern Siberia, thewestern Aleutian Islands, and several groups of islands in the South Pacific.Figure 1.16. Zone Date Changes.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001331.16.2. The local civil date changes at 2400 or midnight. Thus, the date changes as the mean sun transitsthe lower branch of the meridian. Consider the situation in another way. The hour circle of the mean sunis divided in half at the poles. On the half away from the sun (the lower branch), it is always midnightLMT. As the lower branch moves westward (Figure 1.16), it pushes the old date before it and drags thenew date after it. As the lower branch approaches the 180o meridian, the area of the old date decreasesand the area of the new date increases. When the lower branch reaches the date line; that is, when themean sun transits the Greenwich meridian, the old date is crowded out and the new date for that instantprevails in  the  world.  Then,  as  the  lower  branch  passes  the  date  line,  a  newer  date  begins  east  of  thelower branch and the process starts all over again.1.16.3. The zone date changes at midnight zone time (ZT) or when the lower branch of the mean suntransits the central meridian of the zone.1.17. Time Conversion. Sometimes you must convert LMT time to GMT, or GMT to LMT. The  AirAlmanac contains a table for conversion of arc to time at a rate of 15o of arc per hour of time (Figure1.17). This conversion is only good for LMT to GMT, or GMT to LMT. ZT is influenced by daylightsavings time and geographical boundaries. For example, to convert GMT to LMT at 126o-36'W:126o0036'126o36'===8 h 24 min 00s02 min 24s8 h 26 min 24sTo  derive  LMT  from  GMT,  subtract  the  time  in  the  Western  Hemisphere  and  add  it  in  the  EasternHemisphere. Do the opposite to convert LMT to GMT.1.18. Sidereal Time. Solar time is measured with reference to the true sun or the mean sun. Time mayalso be measured relative to a fixed point in space. Time measured with reference to the first point ofAries (ϒ), which is considered stationary although it moves  slightly,  is  sidereal  or  star  time.  The  firstpoint of Aries is defined as where the sun crosses the equator northbound on the first day of spring.1.18.1. The sidereal day begins when the first point of Aries transits the upper branch of the observer'smeridian.  Local  sidereal  time  (LST)  is  the  number  of  hours  that  the  first  point  of  Aries  has  movedwestward from the observers meridian. Expressed in degrees, it equals  the  local  hour  angle  (LHA)  ofAries  (Figure  1.18).  LST  at  Greenwich  is  Greenwich  sidereal  time  (GST)  which  is  equivalent  to  theGHA of Aries.1.18.2. GST, or GHA of Aries, specifies the position of the stars with relation to the earth. Thus, a givenstar is in the same position relative to the earth at the same sidereal time each day.1.19. Number of Days in a Year. The earth revolves around the sun in a year. The number of days inthe year equals the number of rotations of the earth during one revolution. The earth rotates  eastwardabout 366.24 times during its yearly eastward revolution. The total effect of one revolution and 366.24rotations is that the sun appears to revolve around the earth 365.24 times per year. Therefore, there are365.24 solar days per year. Since the sidereal day is measured with reference to a fixed point, the lengthof the sidereal day is the period of the earth's rotation. Therefore, the number of sidereal days in the yearis equal to the number of rotations per year, 366.24.34AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 1.17. Air Almanac Conversion of Arc to Time.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 1.18. Greenwich Sidereal Time.351.20. Navigator's Use of Time. Navigators use three different kinds of time— GMT, LMT, and ZT. Allthree are based upon the motions of the fictitious mean sun. The mean sun revolves about the earth at theaverage rate of the apparent sun, completing one revolution in 24 hours.1.20.1. Time is based upon the motion of the sun relative to a given meridian. The time is 2400/0000 atlower transit and 1200 at upper transit. In GMT, the reference meridian is that of Greenwich; in LMT,the reference meridian is that of a given place; in ZT, the reference meridian is the standard meridian ofa given zone.1.20.2. The difference between two times equals the difference of longitude of their reference meridiansexpressed in time. GMT differs from ZT by the longitude of the zone's standard meridian; LMT differsfrom ZT by the difference of longitude between  the  zone's  standard  meridian  and  the  meridian  of  theplace. In interconverting ZT and GMT, the navigator uses the zone description. The zone difference isthe time difference between its standard meridian and GMT and it has a sign to indicate the correction toZT to obtain GMT. The sign is plus (+) for west longitude and minus (-) for east longitude.Section 1E— Charts and Projections1.21. Basic Information. There are several basic terms and ideas relative to charts and projections thatthe  reader  should  be  familiar  with  before  discussing  the  various  projections  used  in  the  creation  ofaeronautical charts.1.21.1.  A  map  or  chart  is  a  small  scale  representation  on  a  plane  of  the  surface  of  the  earth  or  someportion of it.1.21.2.  A  chart  projection  is  a  systematic  construction  of  lines  on  a  plane  surface  to  represent  theparallels of latitude and the meridians of longitude of the earth or a section of the earth.36AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011.21.3.  The  chart  projection  forms  the  basic  structure  on  which  a  chart  is  built  and  determines  thefundamental characteristics of the finished chart.1.21.4. There are many difficulties that must be resolved when representing a portion of the surface of asphere upon a plane. Two of these are distortion and perspective.1.21.5. Distortion cannot be entirely avoided, but it can be controlled and systematized to some extent inthe drawing of a chart. If a chart is drawn for a particular purpose, it can be drawn in such a way as tominimize the type of distortion which is most detrimental to the purpose. Surfaces that can be spread outin a plane without stretching or tearing, such as a cone or cylinder, are called developable surfaces, andthose  like  the  sphere  or  spheroid  that  cannot  be  formed  into  a  plane  without  distortion  are  callednondevelopable (Figure 1.19).Figure 1.19. Developable and Nondevelopable Surfaces.1.21.6. The problem of creating a projection lies in developing a method for transferring the meridiansand  parallels  to  the  chart  in  a  manner  that  will  preserve  certain  desired  characteristics  as  nearly  aspossible. The methods of projection are either mathematical or perspective.1.21.7. The perspective or geometric projection consists of projecting a coordinate system based on theearth-sphere from a given point directly onto a developable surface. The properties and appearance of theresultant map will depend upon two factors: the type of developable surface and the position of the pointof projection.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001371.21.8.  The  mathematical  projection  is  derived  analytically  to  provide  certain  properties  orcharacteristics which cannot be arrived at geometrically. Let us now consider some of the choices  wehave for selecting projections which best accommodate these properties and characteristics.1.22. Choice of Projection. The ideal chart projection would portray the features of the earth in theirtrue relationship to each other; that is, directions would be true and distances would be represented at aconstant scale over the entire chart. This would result in equality of area and true shape throughout thechart. Such a relationship can only be represented on a globe. On a flat chart, it is impossible to preserveconstant scale and true direction in all directions at all points, nor can both relative size and shape of thegeographic  features  be  accurately  portrayed  throughout  the  chart.  The  characteristics  most  commonlydesired in a chart projection are conformality, constant scale, great circles as straight lines, rhumb linesas straight lines, true azimuth, and geographic position easily located.1.22.1. Conformality. Conformality is very important for air navigation charts. For any projection to beconformal, the scale at any point must be independent of azimuth. This does not imply, however, that thescale at two points at different latitudes will be equal. It means the scale at any given point will, for ashort distance, be equal in all directions.1.22.1.1. For conformality, the outline of areas on the chart must conform in shape to the feature beingportrayed.  This  condition  applies  only  to  small  and  relatively  small  areas;  large  land  masses  mustnecessarily reflect any distortion inherent in the projection.1.22.1.2. Finally, since the meridians and parallels of earth intersect at right angles, the longitude andlatitude  lines  on  all  conformal  projections  must  exhibit  this  same  perpendicularly.  This  characteristicfacilitates the plotting of points by geographic coordinates.1.22.2. Constant Scale. The property of constant scale throughout the entire chart is highly desirable butimpossible  to  obtain,  as  it  would  require  the  scale  to  be  the  same  at  all  points  and  in  all  directionsthroughout the chart.1.22.3. Straight Line. The rhumb line and the great circle are the two curves that a navigator might wishto have represented on a map as straight lines. The only projection that shows all rhumb lines as straightlines is the Mercator. The only projection that shows all great circles as straight lines is the gnomonicprojection.  However,  this  is  not  a  conformal  projection  and  cannot  be  used  directly  for  obtainingdirection or distance. No conformal chart will represent all great circles as straight lines.1.22.4. True Azimuth. It would be extremely desirable to have a projection that showed directions orazimuths as true throughout the chart. This would be particularly important to the navigator, who mustdetermine from the chart the heading to be flown. There is no chart projection representing true greatcircle direction along a straight line from all points to all other points.1.22.5. Coordinates Easy to Locate. The geographic latitudes and longitudes of places should be easilyfound or plotted on the map when the latitudes and longitudes are known.38AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Section 1F— Classification of Projections1.23.  Introduction.  Chart  projections  may  be  classified  in  many  ways.  In  this  pamphlet,  the  variousprojections  are  divided  into  three  classes  according  to  the  type  of  developable  surface  to  which  theprojections are related. These classes are azimuthal, cylindrical, and conical.1.24. Azimuthal Projections. An azimuthal or zenithal projection is one in which points on the earth aretransferred  directly  to  a  plane  tangent  to  the  earth.  According  to  the  positioning  of  the  plane  and  thepoint  of  projection,  various  geometric  projections  may  be  derived.  If  the  origin  of  the  projecting  rays(point  of  projection)  is  the  center  of  the  sphere,  a  gnomonic  projection  results.  If  it  is  located  on  thesurface of the earth opposite the point of the tangent plane, the projection is a stereographic, and if it is atinfinity, an orthographic projection results. Figure 1.20 shows these various points of projection.Figure 1.20. Azimuthal Projections.1.24.1.  Gnomonic  Projection.  All  gnomonic  projections  are  direct  perspective  projections.  Since  theplane of every great circle cuts through the center of the sphere, the point of projection is in the plane ofevery  great  circle.  This  property  then  becomes  the  most  important  and  useful  characteristic  of  thegnomonic projection. Each and every great circle is represented by a straight line on the projection. Acomplete hemisphere cannot be projected onto this plane because points 90o from the center of the mapproject lines parallel to the plane of projection. Because the gnomonic is nonconformal, shapes or landmasses are distorted, and measured angles are not true. At only one point, the center of the projection,are the azimuths of lines true. At this point, the projection is said to be azimuthal. Gnomonic projectionsare classified according to the  point  of  tangency  of  the  plane  of  projection.  A  gnomonic  projection  isAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200139polar gnomonic when the point of tangency is one of the poles, equatorial gnomonic when the point oftangency is at the equator and any selected meridian (Figure 1.21).Figure 1.21. Polar Gnomonic and Stereographic Projections.1.24.2. Stereographic Projection. The stereographic projection is a perspective conformal projection ofthe sphere.1.24.2.1. The term oblique stereographic is applied to any stereographic projection where the center ofthe projection is positioned at any point other than the geographic poles or the equator.1.24.2.2. If the center is coincident with one of the poles of the reference surface, the projection is calledpolar stereographic. The illustration in Figure 1.21 shows both gnomonic and stereographic projections.1.24.2.3.  If  the  center  lies  on  the  equator,  the  primitive  circle  is  a  meridian,  which  gives  the  namemeridian stereographic or equatorial stereographic.1.25.  Cylindrical  Projections.  The  only  cylindrical  projection  used  for  navigation  is  the  Mercator,named after its originator, Gerhard Mercator (Kramer), who first devised this type of chart in the year1569.  The  Mercator  is  the  only  projection  ever  constructed  that  is  conformal  and  at  the  same  timedisplays the rhumb line as a straight line. It is used for navigation, for nearly all atlases (a word coinedby Mercator), and for many wall maps.1.25.1. Imagine a cylinder tangent to the equator, with the source of projection at the center of the earth.It would appear much like the illustration in Figure 1.22, with the meridians being straight lines and theparallels being unequally spaced circles around the cylinder. It is obvious from the illustration that thoseparts  of  the  terrestrial  surface  close  to  the  poles  could  not  be  projected  unless  the  cylinder  wastremendously long, and the poles could not be projected at all.40AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 1.22. Cylindrical Projection.1.25.2.  On  the  earth,  the  parallels  of  latitude  are  perpendicular  to  the  meridians,  forming  circles  ofprogressively  smaller  diameters  as  the  latitude  increases.  On  the  cylinder,  the  parallels  of  latitude  areshown perpendicular to the projected meridians but, since the diameter of a cylinder is the same at anypoint  along  the  longitudinal  axis,  the  projected  parallels  are  all  the  same  length.  If  the  cylinder  is  cutalong a vertical line (a meridian) and spread flat, the meridians appear as equal-spaced, vertical lines,and the parallels as horizontal lines, with distance between the horizontal lines increasing with distanceaway from the false (arbitrary) meridian.1.25.3. The cylinder may be tangent at some great circle other than the equator, forming other types ofcylindrical  projections.  If  the  cylinder  is  tangent  at  some  meridian,  it  is  a  transverse  cylindricalprojection;  if  it  is  tangent  at  any  point  other  than  the  equator  or  a  meridian,  it  is  called  an  obliquecylindrical projection. The patterns of latitude and longitude appear quite different on these projectionsbecause the line of tangency and the equator no longer coincide.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001411.25.4. The Mercator projection is a conformal, nonperspective projection; it is constructed by means ofa mathematical transformation and cannot be obtained directly by graphical means. The distinguishingfeature of the Mercator projection among cylindrical projections is: At any latitude the ratio of expansionof both meridians and parallels is the same, thus, preserving the relationship existing on the earth. Thisexpansion is equal to the secant of the latitude, with a small correction for the ellipticity of the earth.Since  expansion  is  the  same  in  all  directions  and  since  all  directions  and  all  angles  are  correctlyrepresented, the projection is conformal. Rhumb lines appear as straight lines and their directions can bemeasured directly on the chart. Distance can also be measured directly, but not by a single distance scaleon the entire chart, unless the spread of latitude is small. Great circles appear as curved lines, concave tothe equator or convex to the nearest pole. The shapes of small areas are very nearly correct, but are ofincreased size unless they are near the equator as shown in Figure 1.23. The Mercator projection has thefollowing disadvantages:1.25.4.1. Measuring large distances accurately is difficult.1.25.4.2. Must apply conversion angle to great circle bearing before plotting.1.25.4.3. Is useless above 80o N or below 80o S since the poles cannot be shown.Figure 1.23. Mercator Is Conformal but Not Equal Area.1.25.5.  The  transverse  or  inverse  Mercator  is  a  conformal  map  designed  for  areas  not  covered  by  theequatorial  Mercator.  With  the  transverse  Mercator,  the  property  of  straight  meridians  and  parallels  islost, and the rhumb line is no longer represented by a straight line. The parallels and meridians becomecomplex curves and, with geographic reference, the transverse Mercator is difficult to use as a plotting42AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001chart. The transverse Mercator, though often considered analogous to a projection onto a cylinder, is inreality a nonperspective projection, constructed mathematically. This analogy (illustrated in Figure 1.24),however, does permit the reader to visualize that the transverse Mercator will show scale correctly alongthe central meridian which forms the great circle of tangency. In effect, the cylinder has been turned 90ofrom  its  position  for  the  ordinary  Mercator,  and  a  meridian,  called  the  central  meridian,  becomes  thetangential  great  circle.  One  series  of  NIMA  charts  using  this  type  of  projection  places  the  cylindertangent to the 90o E–90o W longitude.Figure 1.24. Transverse Cylindrical Projection— Cylinder Tangent at the Poles.1.25.5.1. These projections use a fictitious graticule similar to, but offset from, the familiar network ofmeridians and parallels. The tangent great circle is the fictitious equator. Ninety degrees from it are twofictitious poles. A group of great circles through these poles and perpendicular to the tangent constitutesthe fictitious meridians, while a series of lines parallel to the plane of the tangent great circle forms thefictitious parallels.1.25.5.2.  On  these  projections,  the  fictitious  graticule  appears  as  the  geographical  one  ordinarilyappearing  on  the  equatorial  Mercator.  That  is,  the  fictitious  meridians  and  parallels  are  straight  linesperpendicular to each other. The actual meridians and parallels appear as curved lines, except the line oftangency.  Geographical  coordinates  are  usually  expressed  in  terms  of  the  conventional  graticule.  Astraight line on the transverse Mercator projection makes the same angle with all fictitious meridians, butnot with the terrestrial meridians. It is, therefore, a fictitious rhumb line.1.25.5.3.  The  appearance  of  a  transverse  Mercator  using  the  90o  E–90o  W  meridian  as  a  reference  orfictitious equator is shown in Figure 1.24. The dotted lines are the lines of the fictitious projection. TheN–S meridian through the center is the fictitious equator, and all other original meridians are now curvesconcave on the N–S meridian with the original parallels now being curves concave to the nearer pole.Tostraighten  the  meridians,  use  the  graph  in  Figure  1.25  to  extract  a  correction  factor  that  willmathematically straighten the longitudes.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200143Figure 1.25. Transverse Mercator Convergence Graph.44AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011.26.  Conic  Projections.  There  are  two  classes  of  conic  projections.  The  first  is  a  simple  conicprojection constructed by placing the apex of the cone over some part of the earth (usually the pole) withthe cone tangent to a parallel called the standard parallel and projecting the graticule of the reduced earthonto the cone as shown in Figure 1.26. The chart is obtained by cutting the cone along some meridianand unrolling it to form a flat surface. Notice, in Figure 1.27, the characteristic gap appears when thecone  is  unrolled.  The  second  is  a  secant  cone,  cutting  through  the  earth  and  actually  contacting  thesurface at two standard parallels as shown in Figure 1.28.Figure 1.26. Simple Conic Projection.Figure 1.27. Simple Conic Projection of Northern Hemisphere.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200145Figure 1.28. Conic Projection Using Secant Cone.1.26.1. Lambert Conformal (Secant Cone). The Lambert conformal conic projection is of the conicaltype in which the meridians are straight lines that meet at a common point beyond the limits of the chartand parallels are concentric circles, the center of each being the point of intersection of the meridians.Meridians and parallels intersect at right angles. Angles formed by any two lines or curves on the earth'ssurface are correctly represented. The projection may be developed by either the graphic or mathematicalmethod. It employs a secant cone intersecting the spheroid at two parallels of latitude, called the standardparallels, of the area to be represented. The standard parallels are  represented  at  exact  scale.  Betweenthese  parallels,  the  scale  factor  is  less  than  unity  and,  beyond  them,  greater  than  unity.  For  equaldistribution of scale error (within and beyond the standard parallels), the standard parallels are selectedat one-sixth and five-sixths of the total length of the segment of the central meridian represented. Thedevelopment of the Lambert conformal conic projection is shown by Figure 1.29.Figure 1.29. Lambert Conformal Conic Projection.46AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011.26.2.  Uses.  The  chief  use  of  the  Lambert  conformal  conic  projection  is  in  mapping  areas  of  smalllatitudinal width but great longitudinal extent. No projection can be both conformal and equal area but,by limiting latitudinal width, scale error is decreased to the extent the projection  gives  very  nearly  anequal area representation in addition to the inherent quality of conformality. This makes the projectionvery useful for aeronautical charts.1.26.3. Advantages. Some of the chief advantages of the Lambert conformal conic projection are:1.26.3.1. Conformality.1.26.3.2. Great circles are approximated by straight lines (actually concave toward the midparallel).1.26.3.3. For areas of small latitudinal width, scale is nearly constant. For  example,  the  United  Statesmay  be  mapped  with  standard  parallels  at  33o  N  and  45o  N  with  a  scale  error  of  only  2  percent  forsouthern Florida. The maximum scale error between 30o30' N and 47o30' N is only one-half of 1 percent.1.26.3.4.  Positions  are  easily  plotted  and  read  in  terms  of  latitude  and  longitude.  Construction  isrelatively simple.1.26.3.5.  Its  two  standard  parallels  give  it  two  lines  of  strength  (lines  along  which  elements  arerepresented true to shape and scale).1.26.3.6.  Distance  may  be  measured  quite  accurately.  For  example,  the  distance  from  Pittsburgh  toIstanbul  is  5,277  NM;  distance  as  measured  by  the  graphic  scale  on  a  Lambert  projection  (standardparallels 36o N and 54o N) without application of the scale factor is 5,258 NM; an error of less than four-tenths of 1 percent.1.26.4. Limitations. Some of the chief limitations of the Lambert Conformal conic projection are:1.26.4.1. Rhumb lines are curved lines which cannot be plotted accurately.1.26.4.2. Maximum scale increases as latitudinal width increases.1.26.4.3. Parallels are curved lines (arcs of concentric circles).1.26.4.4. Continuity of conformality ceases at the junction of two bands, even though each is conformal.If both have the same scale along  their  standard  parallels,  the  common  parallel  (junction)  will  have  adifferent radius for each band and will not join perfectly.1.26.5.  Constant  of  the  Cone.  Most  conic  charts  have  the  constant  of  the  cone  (convergence  factor)computed and listed on the chart somewhere in the chart margin.1.26.6. Convergence Angle (CA). The CA is the actual angle on a chart formed by the intersection ofthe  Greenwich  meridian  and  another  meridian;  the  pole  serves  as  the  vertex  of  the  angle.  CAs,  likelongitudes, are measured east and west from the Greenwich meridian.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001471.26.7. Convergence Factor (CF). A chart's CF is a decimal number which expresses the ratio betweenmeridional convergence as it actually exists on the earth and as it is portrayed on the chart. When theconvergence angle (CA) equals the number of the selected meridian, the chart CF is 1.0. When the CA isless than the number of the selected meridian, the chart CF is proportionately less than 1.0.1.26.7.1. The subpolar projection illustrated in Figure 1.30 portrays the standard parallels, 37o N and 65oN. It presents 360o of the earth's surface on 282.726o of paper. Therefore, the chart has a CF of 0.78535(282.726o divided by 360o equals 0.78535). Meridian 90o W forms a west CA of 71o with the Greenwichmeridian.1.26.7.2. Express as a formula:CF X longitude = CA0.78535 X 90o W = 71o west CA1.26.7.3. Approximate a chart's CF on subpolar charts by drawing  a  straight  line  covering  10  lines  oflongitude and measuring the true course at each end of the line, noting the difference between them, anddividing the difference by 10. NOTE: The quotient represents the chart's CF.Figure 1.30. A Lambert Conformal, Convergence Factor 0.78535.Section 1G— Aeronautical Charts1.27. Basics. An aeronautical chart is a pictorial representation of a portion of the earth's surface uponwhich lines and symbols in a variety of colors represent features or details seen on the earth's surface. Inaddition  to  ground  image,  many  additional  symbols  and  notes  are  added  to  indicate  navigational  aids(NAVAID) and data necessary for air navigation. Properly used, a chart is a vital adjunct to navigation;improperly used, it may become a hazard. Without it, modern navigation would never have reached its48AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001present  state  of  development.  Because  of  their  great  importance,  the  navigator  must  be  thoroughlyfamiliar with the wide variety of aeronautical charts and understand their many uses.1.27.1. Lambert Conformal. Aeronautical charts are produced on many different types of projections.Since the demand for variety in charts is so great and the properties of the projections vary greatly, thereis no one projection satisfying all navigation needs. The projection that most nearly answers all of thenavigator's  problems  is  the  Lambert  conformal,  and  this  projection  is  the  one  most  widely  used  foraeronautical charts. An aeronautical chart of some projection and scale can be obtained for any portionof the earth.1.27.2.  Datums.  Maps  made  by  a  given  country  traditionally  use  the  datum  created  by  that  country.There  may  be  as  many  as  a  thousand  of  these  various  datums  in  use  throughout  the  world.  Inherentproblems result from over a hundred countries using widely different methods and standards to measurecoordinate systems. When added to the effects of local variations in  topography  and  the  gravity  field,systems are created that differ substantially from each other. These individualized datums are classifiedas local or regional.1.27.2.1. The Department of Defense adopted a datum in 1987 called World Geodetic System 84 (WGS84). This global datum is a system that models the entire planet, instead of one small piece. WGS 84 isused by NIMA for production of almost all new maps and charts. The purpose of such a system is tominimize the confusion created by the proliferation of local datums. As long as all coordinates are statedin WGS 84, combat interoperability problems will be minimized. In addition, WGS 84 positions may becomputed from Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment to an extreme level of precision by NIMAsurveyors,  well  under  half  a  meter  anywhere  in  the  world.  Widespread  use  of  WGS  84  will  virtuallyeliminate problems due to different datums.1.27.2.2.  It  is  important  to  realize  that  every  coordinate  is  related  to  a  specific  datum.  A  latitude  andlongitude extracted from a WGS 84 chart is still a WGS 84 coordinate, and an MGRS point pulled fromthat same chart is also WGS 84. However, a ground survey of that same point could have established alocal datum coordinate that is different from the map derived one by as much as a half mile. Always usethe same datum throughout your mission, or serious positional errors are possible.1.28.  Scale.  Obviously,  charts  are  much  smaller  than  the  area  they  represent.  The  ratio  between  anygiven unit of length on a chart and the true distance it represents on the earth is the scale of the chart.The  scale  will  vary,  and  may  vary  greatly  from  one  part  of  the  chart  to  another.  Charts  are  made  tovarious scales for different purposes. If a chart is to show the whole world and yet not be too large, itmust be drawn to small scale. If a chart is to show much detail, it must be drawn to a large scale; then itshows a smaller area than does a chart of the same size drawn to a small scale. Remember: large area,small scale; small area, large scale.1.28.1. Aeronautical Chart. The scale of a chart may be given by a simple statement, such as "1 inchequals 10 miles." This means a distance of 10 miles on the earth's surface is shown 1 inch long on thechart. On aeronautical charts, the scale is indicated in one of two ways: representative fraction or graphicscale.1.28.2. Representative Fraction. The scale may be given as a representative fraction, such as 1:500,000or 1/500,000. This means one of any unit on the chart represents 500,000 of the same unit on the earth.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200149For example, 1 inch on the chart represents 500,000 inches on the earth. A representative fraction can beconverted  into  a  statement  of  miles  to  the  inch.  Thus,  if  the  scale  is  1:1,000,000,  1  inch  on  the  chartstands for 1,000,000 inches or 1,000,000 divided by (6076 x 12) equaling about 13.7 NM. Similarly, ifthe scale is 1:500,000, 1 inch on the chart represents about 6.86 NM. Thus, the larger the denominator ofthe representative fraction, the smaller the scale.1.28.3. Graphic Scale. The graphic scale may be shown by a graduated line. It usually is found printedalong the border of a chart. Take a measurement on the chart and compare it with the graphic scale ofmiles.  The  number  of  miles  the  measurement  represents  on  the  earth  may  be  read  directly  from  thegraphic scale on the chart. The distance between parallels of latitude also provides a convenient scale fordistance  measurement.  One  degree  of  latitude  always  equals  60  NM  and  1  minute  of  latitude  alwaysequals 1 NM.1.29.  DoD  Charts  and  Flight  Information  Publications.  The  DoD  NIMA  publishes  the  NationalImagery and Mapping Agency Catalog of Maps, Charts and Related Products, which contains the latestindexes  of  navigational  and  planning  charts.  This  catalog  also  contains  the  most  current  list  of  FlightInformation  Publications  (FLIP)  used  by  aircrews.  This  publication  is  available  to  aircrews  in  baseoperations,  flight  planning  rooms,  and  other  locations  where  aeronautical  charts  are  issued  or  whereflight planning takes place.1.30. Chart Currency and Updating Information:1.30.1.  DoD  Bulletin  Digest.  This  document  provides  a  complete  cumulative  listing  of  current  charteditions available for distributions of users. Information available in these documents (within each chartseries) is the chart number, current edition and date of edition.1.30.2.  DoD  Chart  Updating  Manual  (CHUM).  This  document  lists,  for  each  current  chart  edition,corrections and additions which could affect flying safety. The unclassified CHUM should be in all flightplanning rooms. The additions and corrections listed for the appropriate charts should be checked andthe applicable ones annotated on the charts. NOTE: The  CHUM does not contain manmade obstaclesless than 199 feet tall. CHUM data is also available on-line at some base operations facilities.1.30.3.  Types  of  Charts.  Aeronautical  charts  are  differentiated  on  a  functional  basis  by  the  type  ofinformation they contain. Navigation charts are grouped into three major types: general purpose, specialpurpose, and plotting. The name of the chart is a reasonable indication of its intended use. A MinimalFlight  Planning  Chart  is  primarily  used  in  minimal  flight  planning  techniques;  and  a  Jet  NavigationChart  has  properties  making  it  adaptable  to  the  speed,  altitude,  and  instrumentation  of  jet  aircraft.  Inaddition  to  the  specific  type  of  information  contained,  charts  vary  according  to  the  amount  ofinformation displayed. Charts designed to facilitate the planning of long distance flights carry less detailthan those required for navigation en route. Local charts present great detail.1.31. Chart Symbols:1.31.1.  Standard  Symbols.  Symbols  are  used  for  easy  identification  of  information  portrayed  onaeronautical charts. While these symbols may vary slightly between various projections, the amount ofvariance is slight and, once the basic symbol is understood, variations of it are easy to identify. A chart50AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001legend  is  the  key  to  explaining  the  meaning  of  the  relief,  culture,  hydrography,  vegetation,  andaeronautical symbols, as shown in Figure 1.31.Figure 1.31. Sample Chart Legend.1.31.2.  Relief  (Hypsography).  Chart  relief  shows  the  physical  features  related  to  the  differences  inelevation of land surface. These include features such as mountains, hills, plateaus, plains, depressions,etc.  Standard  symbols  and  shading  techniques  are  used  in  relief  portrayal  on  charts;  these  includecontours, spot elevations and variations in tint, and shading to represent shadows.1.31.3. Contour Lines. A contour is a line connecting points of equal elevation. Figure 1.32 shows therelationship between contour lines and terrain. Notice on steep slopes the contours are close together andon gentle slopes they are farther apart. The interval of the contour lines usually depends upon the scale ofthe  chart  and  the  terrain  depicted.  In  the  illustration,  the  contour  interval  is  1,000  feet.  Depressioncontours are regular contour lines with spurs or ticks added on the downslope side.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 1.32. Contour Lines.511.31.4.  Spot  Elevations.  Spot  elevations  are  the  height  of  a  particular  point  of  terrain  above  anestablished datum, usually sea level.1.31.5. Gradient Tints. The relief indicating contours is further emphasized on charts by a system ofgradient tints. They are used to designate areas within certain elevation ranges by different color tints.1.31.6. Shading. Perhaps the most obvious portrayal of relief is supplied by graduated shading appliedto  the  southeastern  side  of  elevated  terrain  and  the  northwestern  side  of  depressions.  This  shadingsimulates the shadows cast by elevated features, lending a sharply defined, three-dimensional effect.1.31.7. Cultural Features. All structural developments appearing on the terrain are known as culturalfeatures. Three main factors govern the amount of detail given to cultural features: (1) the scale of thechart, (2) the use of the chart, and (3) the geographical area covered. Populated places, roads, railroads,installations,  dams,  bridges,  and  mines  are  some  of  the  many  kinds  of  cultural  features  portrayed  onaeronautical  charts.  The  true  representative  size  and  shape  of  larger  cities  and  towns  are  shown.Standardized  coded  symbols  and  type  sizes  are  used  to  represent  smaller  population  centers.  Somesymbols  denoting  cultural  features  are  usually  keyed  in  a  chart  legend.  However,  some  charts  usepictorial symbols which are self-explanatory.1.31.8.  Hydrography.  In  this  category,  aeronautical  charts  depict  oceans,  coast  lines,  lakes,  rivers,streams,  swamps,  reefs,  and  numerous  other  hydrographic  features.  Open  water  may  be  portrayed  bytinting or vignetting, or may be left blank.1.31.9. Vegetation. Vegetation is not shown on most small scale charts. Forests and  wooded  areas  incertain parts of the world are portrayed on some medium scale charts. On some large scale charts, parkareas,  orchards,  hedgerows,  and  vineyards  are  shown.  Portrayal  may  be  by  solid  tint,  vignette,  orsupplemented vignette.52AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 1.33. Summary of Typical Charts.1.31.10. Aeronautical Information. In the aeronautical category, coded chart symbols denote airfields,radio  aids  to  navigation,  commercial  broadcasting  stations,  Air  Defense  Identification  Zones  (ADIZ),AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200153compulsory  corridors,  restricted  airspace,  warning  notes,  lines  of  magnetic  variation,  and  specialnavigational  grids.  Some  aeronautical  information  is  subject  to  frequent  change.  For  economy  ofproduction, charts are retained in stock for various periods of time. To keep the charts current, only thestable kinds of information are printed on navigation charts. Aeronautical type data subject to frequentchange is provided the user by the DoD FLIP documents. Consult the DoD CHUM and notices to airmen(NOTAM) for the most current air information and chart information.1.32. Requisitioning Charts and Flight Information Publications:1.32.1. NIMA produces and distributes all aeronautical charts and FLIP documents. A summary of thetypical charts is in Figure 1.33. Requisitions should indicate item identification and terminology for eachitem  requested  as  listed  in  the  catalog.  List  aeronautical  charts  by  series  in  numerical  or  alphabeticalsequence;  list  FLIP  documents  by  type  (en  route,  planning,  terminal),  title,  and  geographic  area  ofcoverage.1.32.2.  When  requisitioning,  refer  to  the  sample  requisition  shown  in  the  DoD  catalog  to  expediteprocessing and prompt shipment of chart and flight information needs.1.32.3.  The  Air  Force  Intelligence  Agency  is  responsible  for  all  Air  Force  mapping,  charting,  andgeodesy (MC&G) matters. Many times in the tactical operation of the Air Force, pilots and navigatorsneed  new  or  additional  cartographic  support  in  performing  their  navigational  duties.  The  followinginformation tells them how to submit requirements for developing or modifying MC&G products.1.32.4. Contact NIMA or its squadrons and detachments for technical assistance in preparing statementsof requirements. Addresses are listed in the NIMA Catalog of Maps, Charts, and Related Products.Section 1H— Position Referencing Systems1.33. Basics. The spherical coordinate system of latitude and longitude sometimes proves difficult to usebecause  its  units  of  degrees,  minutes,  and  seconds  are  not  comparable  to  the  normal  units  of  surfacemeasurement. Further, the geographic graticule is not printed in its entirety on most topographic maps.Consideration  for  the  above  factors  led  to  the  development  of  military  grid  systems  in  an  effort  tosimplify  and  increase  the  accuracy  of  position  referencing.  As  early  as  World  War  I,  the  Frenchsuperimposed a military grid on maps of small areas in order to control artillery fire. After World War I,a number of nations followed the example of the French-devised military grid system for use by theirmilitary forces.1.34. Terms Explained:1.34.1. Military Grid. A military grid (Figure 1.34) is composed of two series of equally spaced parallellines  perpendicular  to  each  other.  The  grid  is  constructed  by  first  establishing  an  origin.  Next,perpendicular axes are drawn through the origin with one of them pointing  to  true  north.  North-southgrid  lines  (eastings)  and  east-west  grid  lines  (northings)  are  then  drawn  parallel  and  perpendicular,respectively, to the north-south axis. On military maps of scale 1:75,000 and larger, the distance betweensuccessive  grid  lines  (grid  interval)  represents  1,000  meters  (or  yards)  at  the  scale  of  the  map.  Themilitary grid is superimposed on charts and maps to permit accurate identification of ground positionsand to allow the computing or measuring of correct distances and directions from one point to another.54AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001The origin is assigned false values to avoid coordinates of negative value. Grid lines are identified bygrid line values printed in two sizes of type in the margin at each end of the grid line. For referencingpurposes,  only  the  grid  line  values  printed  in  the  larger  type  size  (principal  digits),  increased  by  anydigits  needed  to  express  the  reference  to  the  desired  degree  of  accuracy,  are  used.  Grid  line  valuesincrease from west to east and from south to north.Figure 1.34. Military Grid.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001551.34.2.  Position  Referencing  System.  A  position  referencing  system  is  any  system  that  permits  thedesignation  of  a  point  or  an  area  on  the  earth's  surface,  usually  in  terms  of  numbers  or  letters,  or  acombination thereof.1.34.3.  World  Position  Referencing  System.  References  for  points  taken  from  charts  or  maps  notgridded with a military grid are expressed as geographic coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude.1.34.4. Military Grid Reference System (MGRS). This is a position referencing system developed foruse with the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) and Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) grids.1.34.5.  World  Geographic  Reference  System  (GEOREF).  This  is  a  referencing  system  sometimesemployed by the Air Force in the control and direction of air forces engaged in operations not involvingother military forces.1.35. DoD Policy for Position Referencing. It is possible for the practicing navigator to encounter anyor all of the basic reference systems discussed in this pamphlet. The DoD policy for position referencingprocedures for joint use by all the United States military services establishes  two  position  referencingsystems for all joint operations as follows:1.35.1. The system of geographic coordinates expressed in latitude and longitude.1.35.2. The MGRS as developed for use with the UTM and UPS grids.1.35.3. Because military grids are designed to permit accurate identification of ground locations and thecomputation of distance and direction from one point to another, and because all map projections haveinherent  distortion  of  scale  and  angles,  it  is  essential  that  military  grids  be  superimposed  uponprojections having the least distortion. Conformal projections selected by the DoD as having the leastdistortion of scale and angles for large and medium scale mapping are the transverse Mercator and thepolar stereographic. The military grid systems are applied to aeronautical charts primarily for use in AirForce support of ground operations. The Air Force uses the UTM from latitude 80o S to 84o N and theUPS  from  latitudes  84o  N  and  80o  S  to  the  respective  poles.  The  standard  unit  of  measure  used  withUTM and UPS grids is the meter.1.36. Military Grid Reference System (MGRS). The MGRS is designed for  use  with  the  UTM  andUPS grids. The world is divided into large regularly shaped geographic areas, each of which is given aunique identification called the grid zone designation (GZD). These areas are subdivided into 100,000-meter squares, based on the grid covering the area. Each  square  is  identified  by  two  letters  called  the100,000-meter square identification. This identification is unique within the area covered by the GZD.Numerical references within the 100,000-meter square are given to the desired accuracy in terms of theeast (E) and north (N) grid coordinates for the point.1.36.1. GZD. Ordinarily, a reference keyed to a gridded map of any scale is made by giving the 100,000-meter  square  identification  together  with  the  numerical  term.  The  GZD  usually  is  prefixed  to  theidentification when references are made in more than one grid zone.1.36.2. GZD for UTM Grids. Between 72o N and 72o S, the globe is divided into areas 6o east-west by8o  north-south.  Between  72o  N  and  84o  N  (72o  S  and  80o  S)  the  bands  are  not  always  6o  wide.  The56AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001columns (6o wide) are identified by the UTM zone numbers; that is, starting at the 180o meridian andproceeding easterly, the columns are numbered 1 through 60, consecutively (Figure 1.35). The rows (8ohigh,  except  for  the  last  which  is  12o  high)  are  identified  by  letters;  starting  at  80o  S  and  proceedingnortherly to 84o N, the rows are lettered alphabetically C through X with the letters I and O omitted. TheGZD is determined by reading to the right the column designation (as 32), then up the row designation(as T), to obtain 32T (Figure 1.35).Figure 1.35. Designation of UTM Grid Zones.1.36.3.  100,000-Meter  Square  Identification  for  UTM  Grids.  Between  84o  N  and  80o  S,  grid  zoneareas  are  divided  into  100,000-meter  squares  based  on  the  UTM  grid  for  the  zone.  Each  column  ofsquares is identified by a letter and each row of squares is identified by a letter (Figure 1.36). Starting at180o meridian and proceeding easterly along the equator for 18o, the 100,000-meter column, includingpartial columns along grid junctions, are lettered alphabetically A through Z (with I and O omitted). ThisAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200157alphabet is repeated at 18o intervals. The 100,000-meter rows are lettered alphabetically A through V (Iand O omitted) reading from south to north, with this partial alphabet being repeated every 2,000,000meters.  Normally,  every  odd-numbered  UTM  zone  has  the  alphabet  of  the  100,000-meter  row  lettersbeginning  at  the  equator;  the  even-numbered  UTM  zones  normally  have  the  alphabet  of  the  100,000-meter row letters beginning at the northing grid line 500,000 meters south of the equator. This staggeringlengthens  the  distance  between  100,000-meter  squares  of  the  same  identification.  Below  the  equator,100,000 row letters also read alphabetically from south to north, tying into the letters above in the samezone. These principles are illustrated in Figure 1.36.Figure 1.36. Designation of 100,000-Meter Squares, UTM Grid.Figure 1.37. Identification of 100,000-Meter Square (NL) Within UTM Zone 32T.58AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011.36.3.1. The identification of any 100,000-meter square is determined by reading (to the right) first itscolumn letter (as N) and (then up) to its row letter (as L) giving "NL" in Figure 1.37. Under this system,a 100,000-meter square identification usually is not repeated within 18o in any direction. This normallyeliminates the necessity within such distance for preceding grid references with the GZD even thoughthe report is being made from as many as two grid zones away.1.36.3.2. To prevent ambiguity of identifications along spheroid junctions, changes in the order of therow letters are necessary. The row alphabet is shifted l0 letters. Thus, the maximum distance between thesame combination of letter identifiers is increased.1.37. Locating a Military Grid Reference. A military grid reference consists of a group of letters andnumbers  which  indicate  (1)  the  GZD,  (2)  the  100,000-meter  square  identification,  and  (3)  the  gridcoordinates of the point expressed to the desired accuracy. A reference is written as a continuous numberwithout spaces, parentheses, dashes, or decimal points.1.37.1. Examples:1.37.1.1. 32TNL— Locating a point within a 100,000-meter square.1.37.1.2. 32TNL73— Locating a point within a 10,000-meter square.1.37.1.3. 32TNL7438— Locating a point within 1,000 meters.1.37.1.4. 32TNL743385— Locating a point within 100 meters.1.37.2.  To  satisfy  special  needs,  a  reference  can  be  given  to  the  nearest  10  meters  and  the  nearest  1meter. Examples:1.37.2.1. 32TNL74343856— Locating a point within l0 meters.1.37.2.2. 32TNL7434238565— Locating a point within l meter.NOTE: Just because a UTM coordinate contains 10 digits does not mean it is accurate to within 1 meter.It means the coordinate is precise to within one meter. For example, many GPS receivers will report aposition to within 1 meter, yet the signals used to derive that position are accurate only to 100 meters.There is a difference!1.37.3. Normally, all elements of a grid reference are not used. Those to be omitted depend upon the sizeof  the  area  of  activities,  the  proximity  of  a  spheroid  junction,  and  the  scale  of  the  map  to  which  thereference is keyed (interval of grid lines). To give the position of a point, first give the GZD, then the100,000-meter square, such as 32TNL. The designation 32TNL describes the 100,000-meter square (NL)that  is  located  in  the  6o  by  8o  grid  zone,  32T.  The  origin  of  every  100,000-meter  square  is  0.0.  Toreference  a  point  within  a  100,000-meter  square,  give  the  grid  coordinates  of  the  point.  The  gridcoordinates are designated by an even number  of  digits.  The  first  half  of  this  number,  no  matter  howsmall or large, is the easting; the second half, the northing. The reference 32TNL7434238565 locates anobject within a 1-meter square. The  number  74342  is  the  easting  (read  to  the  right)  coordinate,  whileAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20015938565 is the northing (read up) coordinate which locates a point within a 1-meter square of the 100,000-meter square designated as NL and in grid zone 32T (Figure 1.38).Figure 1.38. Grid Coordinates 32TNL7434238565 Identify a 1-Meter Square.1.37.4. Sample Reference of UTM Grid. To illustrate the procedure for locating a point by the UTMgrid system, a fictitious example point identified within a reference box accompanies each grid overprintas shown in Figure 1.39. Using the sample reference, the following procedure illustrates how to locatethe point whose standard reference is 32TNL7438:1.37.4.1.  32T—  identifies  the  6o  by  8o  grid  zone  in  which  the  point  is  located.  NL—identifies  the100,000-meter square in which the point is located.1.37.4.2. 74— The numbers 7 and 4 are both right reading, or easting figures. The first of these two digits(7)  identifies  the  interval  easting  beyond  which  the  point  falls.  The  second  digit  (4)  is  estimated;  itrepresents the value of the imaginary 1,000-meter easting column which includes the point.1.37.4.3. 38— The numbers 3 and 8 are both up reading, or northing figures. The 3 identifies the intervalnorthing beyond which the point falls. Finally, the 8 defines the 1,000-meter estimated northing requiredto complete the area dimensions of the sample reference point.1.37.5. GZD for UPS Grid. In the Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) grid zone, the North Polar Areais divided into two parts by the 180o and 0o meridians. The half containing the west longitudes is giventhe  GZD  Y;  the  half  containing  the  east  longitudes  is  given  the  GZD  Z.  No  numbers  are  used  inconjunction with the letter to give a GZD. Similarly, the South Polar Area is divided into two parts bythe 0o and 180o meridians. The half containing the west longitude is identified as A; the half containingthe east longitude is identified as B. No numbers are used in conjunction with the letter to give a GZD.60AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 1.39. Using UTM Grid System.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001611.37.6. 100,000-Meter Square Identification for UPS Grids. In the North Polar Area, the  180o  –  0omeridians coincide with an even 100,000-meter vertical grid line and the 90o – 90o meridians coincidewith an even 100,000-meter horizontal grid line. Grid north is coincident with the 180o meridian fromthe Pole. In the half of the area identified by the GZD Y, the 100,000-meter columns (these are at rightangles to the 90o – 90o meridians) are labeled R through Z alphabetically from left to right. In the halfidentified by the GZD Z, the 100,000-meter columns are labeled A through J alphabetically from left toright; in this case, the letter I is omitted, and to avoid confusion with 100,000-meter squares in adjoiningUTM zones, the letters, D, E, V and W are omitted. Starting at the 84o parallel and reading toward gridnorth,  the  100,000-meter  rows  at  right  angles  to  the  180o  –  0o  meridians  are  alphabetically  labeled  Athrough  P  (I  and  O  omitted).  The  identification  of  a  100,000-meter  square  consists  of  two  lettersdetermined by reading (right) its column letter and (up) its row letter. In the South Polar Area, a similarplan is followed, except that grid north is coincident with the 0o meridian from the pole. In the half of thearea  identified  by  the  GZD  A,  the  100,000-meter  columns  (these  are  at  right  angles  to  the  90o  –  90omeridians) are labeled J through Z alphabetically from left to right. In the half identified by the GZD B,the 100,000-meter columns are labeled A through R alphabetically from left to right. In both cases, theletters I and O are omitted and, to avoid confusion with 100,000-meter squares in adjoining UTM zones,the letters D, E, M, N, V, and W are also omitted. Starting at the 80o parallel and reading toward gridnorth,  the  100,000-meter  rows  at  right  angles  to  the  180o  –  0o  meridians  are  alphabetically  labeled  Athrough  Z  (I  and  O  omitted).  The  identification  of  a  100,000-meter  square  consists  of  two  lettersdetermined by reading (right) its column letter and (up) to its row letter.1.38. World Geographic Reference (GEOREF) System. The GEOREF system was developed by theAir War College, Air University, as a worldwide geographic referencing system and is generally knownby its short title GEOREF. It makes use of the simplified system of always reading from left to right andup, using a group of letters and numbers to locate a point, thus making the referencing of a point mucheasier  than  using  the  geographic  coordinates  of  latitude  and  longitude  which  require  the  giving  oflatitude  in  degrees,  minutes  and  seconds  (north  or  south)  and  the  longitude  in  degrees,  minutes  andseconds (east or west). For example, to call in a reference to the nearest minute using geocoordinates, itwould be necessary to say 60o12' north, and 119o57' east as compared to a reference to the same pointusing the GEOREF system VLAQ5712. The possibility of error in communicating a reference is greatlyreduced by the relatively simple GEOREF system.1.38.1. Composition. The GEOREF system is  based  on  the  normal  latitude  and  longitude  values  thatappear on all maps and charts. Instead of using a grid system of its own, as does the UTM grid and othermilitary grids, the GEOREF system makes use of the meridians and parallels that appear on the chart.Basically, this system defines the unit geographic area in which a specific point lies. It may be applied toany map or chart, regardless of the type of projection. The GEOREF is read to the right and up in allcases. The point of origin is the 180th meridian and the South Pole. It extends to the right or eastwardfrom  the  180th  meridian  around  the  globe,  360o  to  the  180th  meridian  again.  It  extends  upward  ornorthward from the South Pole, 180o to the North Pole.1.38.2. Referencing. The GEOREF divides the earth's surface into quadrangles of longitude and latitudewith a simple, brief, systematic code that gives positive identification to each quadrangle. The systemand identification codes include:1.38.2.1. Twenty-four longitudinal zones of 15o each, which are lettered from A through Z (omitting Iand O) eastward from the 180th meridian. Twelve bands of latitude, each 15o wide, are lettered from A62AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001through M (omitting I) northward from the South Pole. This combination divides the earth's surface into288 basic 15o quadrangles, each identified by two letters. In local operations confined to a single chart orto a single 15o quadrangle, these letters may be dropped. On small scale charts, the letter designators areshown  in  large  letters  in  the  southwest  corner  of  each  15o  quadrangle.  On  larger  scale  charts,  the  15oquadrangle designators are shown along the border. When the southwest corner of a 15o quadrangle fallsin  the  chart  area,  the  designators  also  are  shown  in  the  southwest  corner  of  the  quadrangle.  Theworldwide breakdown is illustrated by Figure 1.40.Figure 1.40. Location of 15o Quadrangle FJ, GEOREF Index.1.38.2.2. Each basic 15o quadrangle is divided into 15 lettered 1o units eastward and 15 lettered 1o unitsnorthward from A through Q (omitting I and O). Thus, two additional letters (four in all) identify any 1oquadrangle in the world. Figure 1.41 illustrates the alphabetical breakdown of a 15o quadrangle.1.38.2.3. Each 1o quadrangle is divided into 60 numbered minute units eastward and northward. Thus,four  letters  and  four  figures  identify  a  1-minute  quadrangle  anywhere  in  the  world.  This  break-downpermits location of a point within approximately 1 NM. This manner of numbering is used when the 1oquadrangle is located; it does not vary even though the location may be west of the Greenwich meridianor south of the equator. The GEOREF minutes of longitude always increase from west to east, and theGEOREF  minutes  of  latitude  always  increase  from  south  to  north.  This  is  contrary  to  the  geographicAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200163minutes of latitude in the Southern Hemisphere and the geographic minutes of longitude in the WesternHemisphere.Figure 1.41. GEOREF 15o Quadrangle FJ Breakdown into 1o.1.38.2.4. If references of greater accuracy than 1 minute are required, each 1-minute quadrangle may befurther  subdivided  into  decimal  parts  eastward  and  northward.  Four  letters  and  six  figures  define  alocation of one-tenth part of a minute; four letters and eight figures to one-hundredth part of a minute,etc.1.38.2.5.  A  reference  box  is  required  on  all  charts  overprinted  by  GEOREF.  This  box  illustrates  thestandard reference procedures by a fictitious example (Figure 1.42).Figure 1.42. GEOREF Simple Reference.64AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011.38.3. Sample Reference. A GEOREF reference consists of all letters and number characters arrangedin right and up reading order and in largest to smallest area sequence. References are written and read asa continuous series of characters without spaces or punctuation. For example, FJQH1256 is the standardreference  that  identifies  the  southwest  corner  of  the  town  of  Potosi,  Missouri.  Figure  1.43  shows  theprocedure for locating this point.Figure 1.43. To Locate FJQH 1256, Interpolate for 12 and 56.1.38.3.1. FJ— identifies the basic 15o quadrangle.1.38.3.2. QH— identifies the 1o quadrangle.1.38.3.3. 12— identifies the first minute of longitude to left of the point. (This value is read from left toright.)1.38.3.4. 56— identifies the first minute of latitude below the point. (This value is read from bottom totop.)1.38.4. Special Referencing Problems. In addition to making basic area references, it is often necessaryin  air  operations  to  indicate  large  area  and  altitude.  Adaptations  of  the  world  GEOREF  system  withrespect to these requirements follow.1.38.4.1.  To  designate  a  rectangular  or  square  area  other  than  the  basic  area  referred  to  in  the  worldGEOREF system, the following procedure is used:1.38.4.1.1. GEOREF coordinates of the southwest corner of the area.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001651.38.4.1.2. Add the letter S denoting side, immediately following the GEOREF coordinates.1.38.4.1.3. Add digits defining the west to east extent of the area in NM.1.38.4.1.4. Add the letter X denoting multiplied by.1.38.4.1.5. Add digits defining the south to north extent of the area in NM.NOTE: The designation of the rectangular area in Figure 1.44 is EJQK2025S10X12.1.38.4.2. To designate a circular area, reference its center by normal GEOREF coordinates, add the letterR  denoting  radius  and  digits  defining  the  radius  in  NM.  Thus,  the  designation  of  the  circular  area  inFigure 1.44 is EJQK4550R12.Figure 1.44. Examples of GEOREF Coordinates.1.38.4.3. An altitude reference is designated by the letter H denoting height followed by digits, such as H10.  Two  digits  indicate  thousands  of  feet,  the  most  common  reference.  Should  greater  precision  berequired, use three digits to indicate hundreds, four digits to indicate tens, and five digits to indicate unitsof feet.1.38.4.4. To designate Greenwich time, the letter Z is used, followed by two or four digits representinghours or hours and minutes of the 24-hour clock.1.39. Summary. The UTM, UPS, and GEOREF systems are all designed to facilitate location of definitepoints on the earth's surface. They are used primarily when other conventional systems are difficult to66AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001use. The various grid systems used for position location should not be confused with the grid directionalsystem. Grid directional overlays are used in polar navigation. The primary purpose of a grid directionalsystem is to establish a reference direction with regard to some point other than the North Pole. A fullexplanation of  the  construction  and  use  of  the  grid  directional  overlay  is  given  in  the  chapter  on  gridnavigation.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200167Chapter 2MISSION PLANNING2.1. Introduction. Before boarding an aircraft, a navigator must thoroughly plan the mission. A well-planned  mission  will  provide  a  professional  atmosphere,  enhancing  safety  and  accomplishment  ofmission  objectives.  Also,  adequate  mission  planning  prior  to  flight  can  avoid  unnecessary  in-flightproblems.  This  chapter  describes  the  navigator's  mission  planning.  It  begins  with  a  discussion  of  airtraffic  control  systems,  followed  by  a  brief  description  of  publications,  with  which  a  professionalnavigator should be familiar. United States military publications used  for  flight  planning  and  in-flightpurposes  follow  specific  Air  Force  publications.  Most  of  this  chapter  is  devoted  to  general  missionplanning  considerations.  All  phases  of  ground  planning  are  discussed,  from  chart  selection  to  arrivalstudy.Section 2A— Air Traffic Control System2.2. Basics. Most nations of the world today have established airspace, air traffic units, and air trafficservices  to  promote  a  safe,  orderly,  and  expeditious  flow  of  traffic.  Furthermore,  in  the  interest  ofstandardization,  many  nations  are  establishing  systems  according  to  the  standards  and  recommendedpractices adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Navigators must understandwhat  these  air  traffic  services  are  and  how  they  can  be  used  because  military  operations  are  directlyaffected by these services.2.3. Air Traffic Service. Air traffic service is a general term referring to any of the following services:2.3.1. Air Traffic Control. A service provided by ground agencies to prevent collisions and to expediteand maintain an orderly flow of traffic. Air traffic control includes such services as area and en routecontrol, approach control, and tower control. It is used primarily under instrument flight rules (IFR).2.3.2. Advisory Service. This service is provided to give air information that is useful for the safe andeffective  conduct  of  flight.  This  service  is  usually  associated  with  the  visual  flight  rules  (VFR)environment  and  includes  such  services  as  weather  conditions,  location  of  known  traffic,  status  ofnavigational aids (NAVAID), status of airports and facilities, etc.2.3.3. Alerting Service. This is a service provided to notify applicable organizations regarding aircraft inneed of search and rescue aid and to assist such organizations as required.2.4. Airspace. When it has been determined that air traffic services are to be provided, portions of theairspace are designed in relation to the air traffic services that are required. Consult Flight InformationPublication (FLIP) for an in-depth explanation of airspace.2.5.  Air  Traffic  Service  Units.  These  are  the  units  that  provide  the  air  traffic  service  within  definedairspace.2.5.1. Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC). This facility provides air traffic control to IFRflights within controlled airspace.68AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20012.5.2.  Approach  Control.  This  facility  provides  air  traffic  control  to  aircraft  arriving  at  or  departingfrom one or more airports.2.5.3. Airport Control Tower. This facility provides air traffic control service for airport traffic.2.5.4.  Flight  Service  Station  (FSS).  This  facility  is  operated  by  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration(FAA) to provide flight assistance service.2.6. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). To establish international rules for air trafficcontrol, the ICAO was formed in April 1947. ICAO is affiliated with the United Nations as a specializedinternational  body  dealing  with  aviation  matters.  The  member  states  (refer  to  FLIP  General  Planning[GP]) of the ICAO subscribe to ICAO rules and procedures. These rules and procedures are used exceptfor national deviations, which are usually filed with ICAO. Since standardization in ICAO is based uponthe  same  technical  principles  and  policies  which  are  in  actual  effect  in  the  continental  United  States(CONUS),  American  airmen  can  fly  all  major  routes  following  the  same  general  rules  of  the  air,  andgoverned by the same traffic control service with which they are familiar at home.2.6.1. The policy of the DoD is to support activities of the ICAO to standardize air facilities, services,procedures, and practices. This standardization involves rules of the air, air traffic control, search andrescue,  communications  and  NAVAIDs,  maps  and  charts,  Flight  Information  Publications  (FLIP),meteorology, airports, and visual aids. Nations may adopt the ICAO standards, change them slightly, ornot adopt them at all in forming their rules of the air. United States military crews must comply with thenational rules of the foreign state being overflown. If the provisions of AFI 11-202, Volume 3, GeneralFlight Rules, conflict with the national rules of a foreign nation, the national rules apply. However, whenthe provisions of these regulations do not conflict with, but are more restrictive than the national rules,AFI 11-202, Volume 3 will apply. As a general policy, in international airspace over the high seas, AirForce air operations are conducted according to ICAO standards and recommended practices, militarymission permitting.2.6.2. United States military aircraft flying over a foreign country that is not a contracting state of ICAOmust comply with the national practices of that country. It must also adhere to any special provisions ofbilateral  agreements  the  United  States  may  have  with  that  country.  In  the  absence  of  any  nationalpractice or bilateral agreements governing rules of the air, the ICAO rules and procedures are followed.2.7.  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA).  The  United  States  is  a  member  of  ICAO  and  followsICAO standards. Deviations from ICAO standards are filed with ICAO. The FAA is responsible for airtraffic services in the United States and its possessions according to the Federal Aviation Act of 1958,which  consolidated  all  air  traffic  regulatory  agencies  under  the  control  of  the  FAA.  Some  of  theresponsibilities of the FAA include:2.7.1. Operates the air traffic control system within the United States airspace.2.7.2.  Establishes  and  ensures  compliance  with  the  Federal  Aviation  Regulations  (FAR)  which  arebinding on the entire aviation community.2.7.3. Issues licenses to aircrew members, maintenance personnel, and control tower operators.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20012.7.4. Investigates aircraft accidents.692.7.5. Maintains communication stations and NAVAIDs. Flight checks NAVAIDs.Section 2B— Air Force Publications2.8. Basics. The Air Force uses many publications to give direction, offer guidance, and explain policyto Air Force personnel. The publications include Air Force letters, manuals, instructions, pamphlets, andvisual aids. Air Force navigators should familiarize themselves with the Air Force 11-series publicationswhich  include  such  subjects  as  air  navigation,  instrument  flying,  airfield  management  and  baseoperations,  NOTAMs,  overdue  aircraft,  general  flight  rules,  air  traffic  control  procedures,  aircraftspecific procedures, and the 91-series on safety publications.2.8.1.  You  should  become  thoroughly  familiar  with  the  applicable  flying  publications.  AFI  14-205,Identifying  Requirements  for  Obtaining  and  Using  Geospatial  Information  and  Services,  is  also  ofspecial interest to navigators. This regulation provides guidance on the submission of mapping, charting,and  geodetic  (MC&G)  product  requirements,  and  explains  that  the  National  Imagery  and  MappingAgency (NIMA) is available for technical assistance in defining cartographic requirements.Section 2C— Flight Planning Publications and Charts2.9. Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG). Published by the Air Force, the FCG is used by all United Statesmilitary  personnel  traveling  abroad.  It  provides  information  on  all  foreign  nations,  United  Statespossessions, and United States controlled or administered areas outside CONUS.2.9.1. This information covers:2.9.1.1. Aircraft diplomatic clearances and advance notice requirements.2.9.1.2. Personnel clearance and entrance requirements.2.9.1.3. Special restrictions and precautions.2.9.1.4. General briefing information.2.9.1.5. Material clearance requirements.2.9.2.  Additionally  the  FCG  covers  requirements  of  international  agencies,  unified  and  specifiedcommands, command activities exercising command prerogatives, joint missions, and advisory groups.2.9.3. There is also a classified supplement to the FCG, so make sure you read the appropriate sectionsbefore finalizing your plans.2.10.  Flight  Information  Publications  (FLIP).  Complete  aeronautical  information  concerning  airtraffic systems is published in FLIP. The DoD (the primary user) has directed that  FLIP  be  publishedcovering  the  entire  free  world  area.  Published  by  the  NIMA,  FLIP  are  divided  into  three  phases  offlight—planning,  en  route  operations,  and  terminal  operations.  The  en  route  and  terminal  phase70AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001publications have been divided into the following areas: (1) United States; (2) Alaska; (3) Canada andNorth  Atlantic;  (4)  Caribbean  and  South  America;  (5)  Europe,  North  Africa,  and  Middle  East;  (6)Africa; (7) Pacific, Australasia, and Antarctica; and (8) Eastern Europe and Asia.2.10.1. General Planning (GP). This document is revised every 32 weeks with planning change notices(PCN) issued at the 16-week midpoint. Urgent change notices (UCN) are issued as required. The FLIPGP document contains information that is applicable worldwide. It is supplemented by the informationpublished in seven Area Publication Sections.2.10.2.  Area  Planning  (AP/1,  2,  and  3).  Located  behind  GP  in  the  FLIP  Planning  document  binder,contain planning and procedure information for a specific geographical area. Area Planning Documents1,  2,  and  3  are  respectively  North  and  South  America,  Europe-Africa-Middle  East,  and  Pacific-Australasia-Antarctica.2.10.3.  Area  Planning  (AP/1A,  2A,  and  3A).  Located  behind  their  respective  Area  Planningdocuments, these publications contain a tabulation of all prohibited, restricted, danger, warning, and alertareas. In addition,  they  contain  intensive  student  jet  training  areas,  military  training  areas,  and  knownparachute jumping areas within their specific geographical area.2.10.4.  Area  Planning  (AP/1B).  Located  behind  AP/1A  in  the  FLIP  Planning  document.  AP/1Bcontains information relative to military training routes in North and South America, including IFR andVFR military training routes.2.10.5. Planning Change Notices  (PCN).  These  are  in  textual  form  and  are  used  to  update  the  FLIPPlanning document.2.10.6. Flight Information Handbook (FIH). The FIH contains information for in-flight use. Sectionsinclude  emergency  procedures,  national  and  international  flight  data  and  procedures,  meteorologicalinformation,  conversion  tables  and  frequency  pairings,  standard  time  signals,  and  FLIP/NOTAMabbreviations and codes.2.10.7.  FLIP  En  Route  Charts.  Charts  portray  airway  systems,  radio  aids  to  navigation,  airports,airspace divisions and other aeronautical data for IFR operations. FLIP En Route Charts are divided intohigh altitude (l8,000 feet MSL through FL450) for use in the jet route system, and low altitude (1,200feet above the surface up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL) for use in the airway systems. Packets oflow and high altitude charts are available for each geographic area: CONUS; Alaska; Canada and NorthAtlantic;  Caribbean  and  South  America;  Europe,  North  Africa,  and  Middle  East;  Africa;  Pacific,Australasia, and Antarctica; and Eastern Europe and Asia.2.10.8. FLIP En route Supplements. One is published for each geographical areas. Each supplementcontains  an  airport  or  facility  directory,  enroute  procedures,  special  notices,  and  other  textual  datarequired  to  support  FLIP  En  Route  Charts.  In  the  United  States,  there  are  two  supplements.  Onesupplement  is  designed  for  IFR  operations  and  contains  IFR  airport  and  facility  directory,  specialnotices, and procedures required to support the FLIP En Route and Area Charts. The other supplement isdesigned for VFR operations and contains a listing of selected VFR airports with sketches and an IFR orVFR city and airport cross-reference listing. In all other FLIP areas, airport sketches are published for alimited  number  of  selected  airports  and  are  provided  with  a  separate  section  of  the  FLIP  En  RouteAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200171Supplement.  Airport  sketch  details  include  airport  identification,  city  name,  distance,  direction,  andelevation, as well as a diagram of each airport.2.10.9.  Area  and  Terminal  Area  Charts.  These  charts  are  large-scale  graphics  of  selected  terminalareas. In the United States, area charts are provided primarily as area enlargements; in foreign areas, theterminal  area  charts  are  published  primarily  to  provide  arrival  and  departure  routings.  The  area  andterminal charts are printed on the same size sheet as the FLIP En Route Charts (that is, the terminal orarea sheet contains several terminal or area charts) and are distributed with the en route FLIP.2.10.10.  Approaches  and  DPs.  FLIP  terminal  instrument  approach  procedures  and  military  departureprocedures (DP) plates are divided into low altitude approaches (approaches initiated below 18,000 feetMSL),  high  altitude  approaches  (approaches  initiated  normally  at  or  above  18,000  feet  MSL,  such  ashigh performance aircraft), and military DPs. DPs and terminal instrument approach procedures containthe DoD approved departure and instrument approach procedures. Each instrument approach procedureshows an airport sketch, with additional data if necessary, for an approach under IFR conditions.2.10.11.  Terminal  Change  Notices  (TCN).  TCNs  contain  revisions  to  approach  procedures  and  arepublished  normally  at  the  midpoint  of  the  FLIP  terminal  booklets.  The  changes  may  be  in  textual  orgraphic form. In the United States area TCNs revise only the low altitude approaches; however, in theEurope, North Africa, Middle East area, and Pacific, Australasia, and Antarctica areas, TCNs revise bothlow and high altitude approaches. In the other four FLIP areas, TCNs are not published and NOTAMsmust be consulted for changes to approach procedures.2.10.12. Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR). STARs contain preplanned IFR air traffic controlarrival routes and are published in graphic and/or textual form. STARs provide transition from the enroute structure to a fix or point from which an approach can be made. In Alaska, Pacific, Australasia, andAntarctica  areas,  STAR  information  is  contained  in  the  FLIP  terminal  booklets.  In  the  United  States,STARs are published in a bound booklet with civilian DPs.2.10.13.  Notice  to  Airman  (NOTAM).  A  NOTAM  is  a  message  requiring  expeditious  and  widedissemination  by  telecommunication  means.  NOTAMs  provide  information  that  is  essential  to  allpersonnel  concerned  with  flight  operations.  NOTAM  information  is  normally  in  the  form  ofabbreviations or a NOTAM code. The FIH contains an alphabetical list of these abbreviations.Section 2D— Flight Planning2.11. Basics. In the air, there is little time for lengthy processes of reasoning. Decisions must be madequickly and accurately; therefore, careful planning is essential to any flight. A smooth, successful flightrequires a careful step-by-step plan, which can be followed from takeoff to landing.2.12. Route Determination. When planning a route to be flown, many factors enter into consideration.The route may be dictated by operational requirements of the mission; it may be a preplanned route, orthe navigator may have the prerogative of selecting the route to be flown. In any case, definite factorsaffect route selection and the navigator must be aware of them.2.12.1. In most cases, a direct route is usually best because it conserves both time and fuel. Such thingsas airways, routing, high terrain, and bad weather, however, can affect this. The direction of prevailing72AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001winds can affect route selection because the proper use of a jet stream often decreases total flying time,even though a direct route is not flown.2.13. Chart Selection. Once a route is established, navigation charts appropriate to the intended flightpath  should  be  selected.  Correct  selection  depends  on  distance  to  be  flown,  airspeeds,  methods  ofnavigation, and chart accuracy.2.13.1. Total Distance to Fly. A great circle is the shortest distance between two points. You can saveconsiderable  distance  by  flying  a  great  circle  course,  particularly  on  long-range  missions  in  polarlatitudes. A straight line on a gnomonic chart represents a great circle course. One way to flight plan agreat  circle  course  is  to  plot  the  entire  route  on  a  gnomonic  chart,  then  transfer  coordinates  to  chartsmore  suitable  for  navigation,  such  as  a  Transverse  Mercator.  Select  coordinates  at  intervals  ofapproximately  300  NM.  Once  the  route  is  plotted  on  the  navigational  chart,  record  true  courses  anddistances for each leg of the mission on the flight plan.2.13.2.  Chart  and  Methods  of  Navigation.  The  method  of  navigation  is  determined  by  missionrequirements  and  the  flight  mission  area.  Select  charts  for  the  mission  which  are  best  suited  to  thenavigational techniques chosen. For  example,  radar  missions  require  charts  with  representative  terrainand  cultural  returns  for  precision  fixing  and  grid  missions  require  charts  with  a  grid  overlay.  Chartsproduced by NIMA are shown in Figure 2.1.Figure 2.1. NIMA Charts.CHARTS PRODUCED BY THE NATIONAL IMAGERY AND MAPPING AGENCY1501 AIRPCTPCONCWACASWPCJNCJNUCECJNCAGNCNASCJoint Operations GraphicsSectional Aeronautical ChartsPilotage Charts (Small Size)Tactical Pilotage ChartsOperational Navigational ChartsWorld Aeronautical ChartsAnti-Submarine Warfare Plotting ChartsJet Navigation ChartsUniversal Jet Navigation ChartsContinental Entry ChartsJet Navigation ChartsGlobal Navigation Planning ChartsAntarctic Strip Charts1: 250,0001: 500,0001: 500,0001: 500,0001: 1,000,0001: 1,000,0001: 1,166,6121: 2,000,0001: 2,000,0001: 2,000,0001: 3,000,0001: 5,000,000Various2.13.3. When To Use Separate Charts. When several navigational techniques are planned, it may beconvenient to use separate charts for different navigational legs. The entire route might be plotted on ajet navigation chart (JNC) for pre-mission briefing, reference, etc.; the radar navigational legs plotted onan operational navigation chart (ONC) to aid in precision fixing; and the target area plotted on a tacticalpilotage chart (TPC) for accurate target identification.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001732.13.4. Scale. The scale of charts used for navigation varies inversely with the speed of the aircraft. Forexample,  JNCs  have  a  small  scale  and  contain  features  appropriate  for  high-speed  navigation.Navigation at slower speeds requires large-scale charts providing more detailed coverage.2.13.5. NIMA Documents. The navigator should always ensure the chart being used is the latest edition.The following listed documents published by NIMA provide this information:2.13.5.1. DoD Bulletin Digest. The digest contains a listing of the current chart editions.2.13.5.2. DoD Bulletin. The bulletin updates the Bulletin Digest and informs Air Force activities of theavailability of new aeronautical charts and new editions of previously published charts.2.13.5.3. NIMA Aeronautical Chart Updating Manual (CHUM). The CHUM provides the latest chartcorrection  information.  It  is  published  semiannually  with  monthly  supplements  and  contains  acumulative listing of significant changes and additions to navigation and planning charts. A copy of theCHUM is maintained in each base operations. CHUM is also available on line at most base operations.2.13.6. NOTAMs. Interim aeronautical flight information changes are disseminated by NOTAMs, whichare available in each base operations until the change is provided in all pertinent FLIPs. NOTAMs alsoprovide the most current information on restrictions to flight, reliability of airport facilities and services,en route hazards, radio aids, etc., NOTAMs are also available on line at most base operations.Section 2E— Airways2.14. Types and Use of Airways. Airways are corridors established by a national government within itsairspace to facilitate the navigation and control of air traffic under IFR conditions. Usually, an airway is10 statute miles wide and follows a route over the ground defined by radio NAVAIDs.2.14.1. Generally, there are many different airways within a country as evidenced by those established inthe  United  States.  (NOTE:  In  the  United  States  as  well  as  in  other  countries,  there  are  two  sets  ofairways (one for low altitudes and one for high altitudes.) To distinguish one airway from another, eachhas its own designator, such as V (low altitude),  and  J  (high  altitude).  These  designators  simplify  thepreparation of a flight plan and improve the communication between aircrews and air traffic controllers.2.14.2.  Military  aircrews  are  encouraged  to  use  airways  to  simplify  traffic  control  if  the  mission  willpermit. The most current and complete information on airways is contained in the DoD FLIPs. There ismuch  information  included  in  these  documents  which  has  significant  interest  to  navigators,  such  asmagnetic  courses,  distances,  compulsory  reporting  points,  frequencies,  and  call  signs  of  radioNAVAIDS.2.15. Alternate Airfield. An alternate airfield is where an aircraft intends to land if weather conditionsprevent  landing  at  a  scheduled  destination.  Occasionally,  an  airfield  may  also  be  identified  as  analternate for takeoff purposes. This procedure is at the direction of a major command that authorizes theuse of lower minimums for takeoff  than  for  landing.  The  conditions  under  which  an  alternate  airfieldmust be selected and when it will be used are established by the Air Force in AFI 11-202, Volume 3.74AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20012.16. Emergency Airfields. During flight planning, select certain airfields along the planned flight routeas possible emergency landing areas and then annotate these airfields on the charts for quick reference.Consider  the  following  factors  when  selecting  an  emergency  airfield:  type  of  aircraft,  weatherconditions, runway length, runway weight-bearing capacity, runway lighting, and radio NAVAIDs. TheNOTAMs for these airfields should be checked prior to flight.2.17.  Highest  Obstruction.  After  the  route  has  been  determined,  the  navigator  should  study  the  areasurrounding  the  planned  route  and  annotate  the  highest  obstruction  (terrain  or  cultural).  The  distancewithin which the highest obstruction will be annotated is IAW governing or local directives. The highestobstruction  will  be  taken  into  consideration  when  determining  the  minimum  en  route  altitude  (MEA)and in emergency procedures discussion.2.18.  Special  Use  Airspace.  When  determining  the  flight  planned  route,  the  locations  of  special  useairspace will have to be considered. The best way to find the locations of the areas is by checking an enroute chart. After the route is determined, any special use airspace that may be close enough to the routeof flight to cause concern (as per governing directives) should be annotated on the chart with pertinentinformation. Annotate time and days of operation, effective altitudes, and any restriction applicable tothat  area.  These  areas,  when  annotated  on  the  chart,  will  assist  the  navigator  with  in-flight  missionchanges and prevent planning a route of flight that cannot be flown.Section 2F— Flight Plans2.19.  Manual  Flight  Plans.  Flight  plans  differ  in  format  between  services  and  commands.  To  meetspecialized  operational  requirements,  each  command  prescribes  and  issues  its  own  navigation  forms.Typical completed flight plan forms are shown in Figures 2.2 and 2.3. There are slight differences in theflight plan columns; the main differences are in the time and fuel analysis sections. The headings andcolumns on the forms are self-explanatory.2.20.  Computer  Flight  Plans.  Computer  flight  plans  can  be  obtained  from  operations  or  weatherpersonnel  prior  to  departure.  The  navigator  computes  only  additional  information  required  by  localprocedures, such as equal time point (ETP) or fuel analysis. A typical computer flight plan is illustratedin Figure 2.4. There are many different types of computer flight plans; they provide essentially the sameinformation, but in different formats.2.21. Fuel Analysis. For the following fuel planning discussion, refer to Figure 2.2.2.21.1. En Route Fuel. En route fuel is determined with a fuel graph such as the one depicted in Figure2.5.  Each  type  aircraft  has  a  series  of  fuel  graphs  based  on:  (1)  aircraft  gross  weight,  (2)  pressure  ordensity altitude, (3) true airspeed (TAS) or Mach number and on some aircraft, (4) the aerodynamic dragof  external  stores.  En  route  fuel  is  computed  in  a  manner  that  will  take  into  account  the  worst  fuelconsumption situation, such as the lowest cruise altitude and highest airspeed. Most fuel graphs will bedesigned for standard day conditions, so temperature deviation will have to be considered. En route fuelcan be calculated from the start descent point or initial approach fix (IAF), whichever is specified by thecommand.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 2.2.

Typical Fuel Graph.7778AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20012.21.2. Fuel Reserve. This is the quantity of fuel carried in excess of mission requirements if the flightis  completed  as  planned.  Major  commands  are  authorized  to  establish  fuel  requirements  for  assignedaircraft. In the absence of command established reserves, refer to AFI 11-202, Volume 3, for additionalinformation.2.21.3. En route Plus Reserve. Add en route time and reserve time together to obtain the en route plusreserve time. In some commands, this fuel is extracted from the fuel graph in the same manner as the enroute fuel.2.21.4. Alternate Fuel. The fuel to the alternate is based on the fuel flow for the gross weight of theaircraft at destination, the true airspeed (TAS) and altitude flown to the alternate. Some flight manualsinclude graphs designed for computing fuel to the alternate, but the fuel can also be computed by addingthe time to the alternate and to the en route time. This time is then used to extract the total fuel requiredfrom takeoff to alternate. En route fuel is then subtracted from this to obtain the fuel to the alternate. Astandard fuel amount may be added to allow for a missed approach at the original destination.2.21.5. Holding Fuel. Adverse weather, air traffic, or aircraft malfunction in the terminal area may forcethe aircraft to hold in the local area for a period of time before landing. The amount of holding fuel isbased on any planned delays according to applicable directives.2.21.6. Approach and Landing Fuel. Approach and landing fuel is the fuel required from the terminalfix to the runway. This is computed for a prescribed amount of time (usually 15 minutes). The amount offuel needed for approach and landing varies with the aircraft.2.21.7.  Total  Takeoff  or  Flaps  Up.  This  is  the  cumulative  total  fuel  from  takeoff  or  flaps  up  that  isrequired for en route, reserve, alternate, holding, and approach and landing.2.21.8. Taxi and Runup. The fuel needed for taxiing, engine runup, and acceleration to takeoff speed. Itis usually a predetermined value for each type of aircraft.2.21.9. Required Ramp Fuel. The amount of fuel required at engine start to complete the mission.2.21.10. Actual Ramp Fuel. The fuel on board prior to engine start.2.21.11. Unidentified Extra Fuel. Additional fuel over and above that required by the flight plan. It isthe difference between required ramp fuel and actual ramp fuel.2.21.12.  Burnoff  Fuel.  Burnoff  is  the  planned  amount  of  fuel  to  be  used  after  takeoff.  This  valuesubtracted from takeoff gross weight is equal to the approximate aircraft gross weight at landing.2.22.  Range  Control  Graph.  The  Range  Control  Graph  portrays  planned,  minimum,  and  actual  fuelconsumption.  A  typical  range  control  graph  is  shown  in  Figure  2.6.  It  is  used  to  flight  plan  fuelconsumption and serves as an in-flight worksheet for comparing actual and planned fuel consumption.The range control graph can be constructed with information taken from a completed flight plan such asFigure  2.2  and  the  applicable  fuel  planning  graph  (Figure  2.5).  After  calculating  the  required  fuel  atcheckpoints along the route, the fuel remaining (vertical) is plotted against time remaining (horizontal).The planned fuel consumption is then plotted on the graph along with the minimum required fuel line.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200179In-flight fuel readings are taken periodically and plotted on the graph to determine the fuel consumptionin relation to that planned.Figure 2.6. Typical Range Control Graph.2.22.1.  The  planned  line  is  determined  by  calculating  the  fuel  remaining  and  time  remaining  atpredetermined  points  in  the  mission  and  then  plotting  these  points  on  the  graph  and  connecting  themwith  a  line.  The  minimum  line  is  determined  by  adding  up  all  fuel  required  as  a  minimum  at  thedestination  (reserve,  alternate,  approach,  etc.)  and  plotting  it  on  the  zero  time  remaining  line.  Thedifference between the minimum fuel required and the planned fuel on the zero time remaining line isthen plotted below each of the predetermined fuel remaining points on the planned line. The points areconnected  with  a  line  that  represents  the  minimum  required  fuel  line.  This  line  is  used  to  determinewhether or not to continue the mission.2.22.2. In-flight fuel readings are obtained and plotted against time remaining to determine fuel status.These plotted points are then connected with a dotted line that represents the actual fuel consumption.The trend of the in-flight fuel readings indicates actual fuel consumption and is used to make missiondecisions with regard to fuel.2.23. Equal Time Point (ETP). The ETP (Figure 2.7) is that point along the route (normally one withan extended overwater leg) from which it takes the same amount of time to return to departure (or the80AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001last  suitable  airfield  prior  to  beginning  the  overwater  leg  of  the  mission)  as  it  would  to  continue  todestination (or the first suitable airfield for landing). The ETP is  not  necessarily  the  midpoint  in  timefrom departure to destination. Its location is somewhere near the midpoint of the route (between suitableairfields), and it is dependent upon the wind factors.Figure 2.7. Equal Time Point.2.23.1. A wind factor (WF) is a headwind or tailwind component, computed at planned altitude betweensuitable airfields by comparing the average groundspeed (GS) to the average true airspeed (TAS). To dothis, algebraically subtract the TAS from the GS. A WF with a minus value is a headwind; positive is atailwind. When computing ETP, obtain a WF for each half of the route.2.23.2. Wind factors may play a major role in determining whether or not you can reach your destination.The  overall  or  Total  Wind  Factor  (TFW)  is  the  average  of  WF1  and  WF2  and  is  computed  using  theformula (WF1 + WF2) divided by 2.2.23.3. An ETP is computed using the following formula:2.23.4. Total distance is the distance in NMs from the last suitable airfield to the first suitable airfield,measured along the route of flight. WF2 and WF1 are wind factors for the second and first halves of theroute segment, respectively. T is the time remaining in minutes from the ETP to the first suitable airfield.This time can be converted to distance by applying the GS for the second half of the route segment. Thedistance can then be measured uptrack and the ETP plotted on the chart. The time should be plotted onthe range control graph with a vertical line that crosses both the planned and minimum lines. If the firstsuitable  airfield  is  not  the  planned  landing  airfield,  then  the  time  should  be  added  between  the  firstsuitable airfield and the landing airfield to determine the ETP.2.24.  Endurance.  Endurance  is  the  length  of  time  an  aircraft  can  remain  airborne,  not  includingminimum required fuel. Endurance can be computed by taking the last plotted fuel reading and followinga line parallel to the fuel remaining lines in the direction of increasing time remaining until interceptingthe minimum line. This point and its corresponding time remaining represent the endurance at the timeof the fuel reading that is being used. Endurance is critical in making in-flight diversion decisions.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Section 2G—Route Study812.25. Mission Planning. During mission planning, crewmembers should conduct a route study. For thenavigator, a route study encompasses three phases of flight—takeoff and climb, cruise, and approach andlanding. The following paragraphs discuss these three areas in general terms as specific weapon systems,and missions will most often differ in their objectives and parameters.2.26.  Takeoff  and  Climb.  Before  completing  pre-flight  planning  you  should  be  familiar  with  thedeparture  procedure  filed.  Check  the  NAVAIDs,  such  as  tactical  air  navigation  (TACAN),  VHFomnidirectional  range  (VOR)  and  automatic  direction  finder  (ADF)  to  be  used  on  the  departureprocedure.  Note  magnetic  headings,  radials,  or  bearings  and  altitude  restrictions.  AFMAN  11-217,Volumes  1  and  2,  Instrument  Flight  Procedures,  discuss  as  how  to  accurately  monitor  instrumentdepartures.2.26.1.  Duties.  During  takeoff  and  climb,  the  navigator's  duties  include  monitoring  the  departureprocedure,  copying  clearances,  and  ensuring  applicable  altitude  restrictions  and  terrain  clearance  aremaintained.2.26.2.  Estimated  Times  of  Arrival  (ETA).  During  climb-out,  controlling  authorities  may  requestETAs, and generally it's the navigator's duty to compute these ETAs. Use the best source of groundspeedto compute ETAs. As a backup, you can use the INS, flight-planned GS, or TACAN distance measuringequipment (DME) change for groundspeed. When a controlled time of arrival is required, the navigatorshould  compute  an  indicated  airspeed  (IAS)  or  true  airspeed  (TAS)  for  the  pilot  to  maintain  whenapproaching cruise altitude.Section 2H— Cruise2.27. Navigator's Duties. While the primary duty is to monitor and direct the progress of the aircraft,the  navigator  must  meet  many  associated  requirements,  such  as  completing  the  log,  filling  out  forms,working controlled ETAs, and analyzing the information received from the navigation equipment.2.28. Log. The navigator's log is usually the only record of the aircraft's actual position at any given timeduring  the  flight.  For  this  reason,  it  must  be  accurate  and  complete.  Log  procedures  vary  betweenorganizations; however, the basic log requirements and purpose remain the same—to keep an accuraterecord of data for the navigator's reference and debriefing purposes and to serve as a worksheet for thenavigator.  Generally,  required  items  for  log  entry  are  all  information  necessary  to  reconstruct  themission.2.29. Celestial Precomps. Like logs, celestial precomp forms also vary between organizations. Like thelog, the computational format may vary; however, the celestial computations themselves are essentiallythe same.Section 2I— Approach and Landing2.30. Standard Approaches. The descent portion of the flight is similar to the climb portion. Instrumentapproach plates are established for almost all airfields of any significance in the world. The publishedapproaches are normally flight-checked for safety of flight; if not, they are appropriately annotated. The82AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001navigator  must  make  certain  that  the  route  affords  adequate  terrain  clearance  given  by  the  approachcontrol. Because of congested air traffic, approaches must be followed precisely. The navigator shouldmonitor the aircraft position and altitude during descent and advise the pilot of any deviations. AFMAN11-217 discusses how to accurately monitor instrument approaches.2.31.  Airborne  Radar  Approach  (ARA).  Another  type  of  approach  to  the  terminal  airfield  is  theairborne  radar  approach.  The  ARA  is  an  alternate  procedure  used  when  the  other  approaches  are  notavailable. During an ARA, the navigator provides all directions and altitudes to the pilot. ARA letdownplates are published for some airfields, and when one is not available, the navigator can construct one. Atypical ARA approach is shown in Figure 2.8. Compute the absolute altitude above field elevation foreach 1-mile increment from touchdown point on final approach, using the rate of descent and the finalapproach speed for the aircraft being flown. Add the field elevation to each of the altitudes to computethe correct indicated altitude for the pilot to fly.2.31.1. Most major commands who do ARAs plan to reach to minimum descent altitude (MDA)  at  2NM and continue at that altitude to the missed approach point (MAP) at 1 NM.2.31.2.  The  ARA  may  begin  with  or  without  ground  based-vectors.  In  either  case,  once  on  the  finalapproach,  the  navigator  is  directing  the  aircraft.  During  the  ARA,  the  navigator  must  keep  the  pilotinformed of the altitudes and headings to the runway.2.32. Summary. In-flight duties for the navigator are many and diverse. As it is true that pilots earn theirmoney on takeoffs and landings, navigators earn their money during the cruise portion, but they are alsoresponsible for monitoring the departure and approach. Since crew safety and mission accomplishmentare  affected  by  each  crewmember's  performance,  the  success  of  any  mission  depends  in  part  on  thenavigator's  competence.  Conscientious  performance  of  in-flight  duties  can  avert  embarrassing  anddangerous situations for the entire crew.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200183Figure 2.8. Typical Airborne Radar Approach Construction Graph.84AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Chapter 3BASIC INSTRUMENTSSection 3A— Introduction3.1. Basics. Instruments mechanically measure physical quantities or properties with varying degrees ofaccuracy.  Much  of  a  navigator's  work  consists  of  applying  corrections  to  the  indications  of  variousinstruments and interpreting the results. Therefore, navigators must be familiar with the capabilities andlimitations of the instruments available to them.3.1.1. A navigator obtains  the  following  flight  information  from  basic  instruments:  direction,  altitude,temperature, airspeed, drift, groundspeed (GS).3.1.2. Some of the basic instruments are discussed in this chapter. The more complex instruments whichmake accurate and long distance navigation possible are discussed in later chapters or in specific aircrafttechnical orders.Section 3B— Direction3.2. Basic  Instruments. The  navigator  must  have  a  fundamental  background  in  navigation  to  ensureaccurate positioning of the aircraft. Dead reckoning (DR) procedures aided by basic instruments give thenavigator the tools to solve the three basic problems of navigation: position of the aircraft, direction todestination, and time of arrival. Using only a basic instrument such as the compass and drift information,you can navigate directly to any place in the world. Various fixing aids, such as celestial and radar, cangreatly  improve  the  accuracy  of  basic  DR  procedures.  This  chapter  will  discuss  the  basic  instrumentsused  for  DR  and  then  review  the  mechanics  of  DR,  plotting,  wind  effect,  and  computer  solutions.Directional information needed to navigate is obtained by use of the earth's magnetic lines of force. Acompass  system  uses  a  device  that  detects  and  converts  the  energy  from  these  lines  of  force  to  anindicator reading. The magnetic compass operates independently of the aircraft electrical systems. Laterdeveloped compass systems require electrical power to convert these lines of force to an aircraft heading.3.3.  Earth's  Magnetic  Field.  The  earth  has  some  of  the  properties  of  a  bar  magnet;  however,  itsmagnetic poles are not located at the geographic poles, nor are the two magnetic poles located exactlyopposite  each  other  as  on  a  straight  bar.  The  north  magnetic  pole  is  located  approximately  at  73o  Nlatitude and 100o W longitude on Prince of Wales Island. The south magnetic pole is located at 68o Slatitude and 144o E longitude on Antarctica.3.3.1.  The  earth's  magnetic  poles,  like  those  of  any  magnet,  can  be  considered  to  be  connected  by  anumber of lines of force. These lines result from the magnetic field which envelops the earth. They areconsidered to be emanating from the south magnetic pole and terminating at the north magnetic pole asillustrated in Figure 3.1.3.3.2. The force of the magnetic field of the earth can be divided into two components: the vertical andthe  horizontal.  The  relative  intensity  of  these  two  components  varies  over  the  earth  so  that,  at  themagnetic  poles,  the  vertical  component  is  at  maximum  strength  and  the  horizontal  component  isminimum. At approximately the midpoint between the poles, the horizontal component is at maximumAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200185strength and the vertical component is minimum. Only the horizontal component is used as a directiveforce for  a  magnetic  compass.  Therefore,  a  magnetic  compass  loses  its  usefulness  in  an  area  of  weakhorizontal force such as the area around the magnetic poles.Figure 3.1. Earth's Magnetic Field Compared to a Bar Magnet.3.3.3. The vertical component causes the end of the needle nearer to the magnetic pole to tip as the poleis approached (Figure 3.1). This departure from the horizontal is called magnetic dip.Section 3C— Compasses3.4. Basics. A compass may be defined as an instrument that indicates direction over the earth's surfacewith reference to a known datum. Various types of compasses have been developed, each of which isdistinguished by the particular datum used as the reference from which direction is measured. Two basictypes of compasses are in current use—the magnetic and gyrocompass.86AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20013.4.1. The magnetic compass uses the lines of force of the earth's magnetic field as a primary reference.Even though the earth's field is usually distorted by the pressure of other local magnetic fields, it is themost widely used directional reference.3.4.2.  The  gyrocompass  uses  as  its  datum  an  arbitrary  fixed  point  in  space  determined  by  the  initialalignment  of  the  gyroscope  axis.  Compasses  of  this  type  are  widely  used  today  and  may  eventuallyreplace the magnetic compass entirely.3.5.  Magnetic  Compass.  The  magnetic  compass  indicates  direction  in  the  horizontal  plane  withreference to the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field. This field is made up of the earth'sfield in combination with other magnetic fields in the vicinity of the compass. These secondary fields arecaused  by  the  presence  of  ferromagnetic  objects,  etc.  Magnetic  compasses  may  be  divided  into  twoclasses: (1) the direct-indicating magnetic compass in which the measurement of direction is made by adirect  observation  of  the  position  of  a  pivoted  magnetic  needle;  and  (2)  the  remote-indicating  gyro-stabilized magnetic compass. Magnetic direction is sensed by an element located at positions where localmagnetic  fields  are  at  a  minimum,  such  as  the  vertical  stabilizer  and  wing  tips.  The  direction  is  thentransmitted electrically to repeater indicators on the instrument panels.Figure 3.2. Magnetic Compass.3.5.1.  Direct-Indicating  Magnetic  Compass.  Basically,  the  magnetic  compass  is  a  magnetized  rodpivoted at its middle, with several features incorporated to improve its performance. One type of direct-indicating  magnetic  compass,  the  B-16  compass  (often  called  the  whiskey  compass),  is  illustrated  inFigure 3.2. It is used as a standby compass in case of failure of the electrical system that operates theremote compasses. It is a reliable compass and will give good navigational results if used carefully.3.5.2.  Magnetic  Variation  and  Compass  Errors.  The  earth's  magnetic  poles  are  joined  by  irregularcurves  called  magnetic  meridians.  The  angle  between  the  magnetic  meridian  and  the  geographicmeridian is called the magnetic variation. Variation is listed on the charts as east or west. When variationAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200187is east, magnetic north (MN) is east of true north (TN). Similarly, when variation is west, MN is west ofTN (Figure 3.3). Lines connecting points having the same magnetic variation are called isogonic lines, asshown in Figure 3.4. Compensate for magnetic variation to convert a compass direction to true direction.Figure 3.3. Variation Is Angle Between True North and Magnetic North.Figure 3.4. Isogonic Lines Show Same Magnetic Variation.3.5.2.1.  Compass  error  is  caused  by  nearby  magnetic  influences,  such  as  magnetic  material  in  thestructure of the aircraft and its electrical systems. These magnetic forces deflect a compass needle fromits normal alignment. The amount of such deflection is called deviation which, like variation, is labeledeast or west as the north-seeking end of the compass is deflected east or west of MN, respectively.88AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20013.5.2.2. The correction for variation and deviation is usually expressed as a plus or minus value and iscomputed as a correction to true heading (TH). If variation or deviation is east, the sign of the correctionis minus; if west, the sign is plus. A rule of thumb for this correction is easily remembered as east is leastand west is best.3.5.2.3.  Aircraft  headings  are  expressed  as  true  headings  or  magnetic  headings.  If  the  heading  ismeasured  in  relation  to  geographical  north,  it  is  a  TH.  If  the  heading  is  in  reference  to  MN,  it  is  amagnetic heading (MH); if it is in reference to the compass lubber line, it is a compass heading (CH).CH corrected for variation and deviation is TH. MH corrected for variation is TH.3.5.2.4.  This  relationship  is  best  expressed  by  reference  to  the  navigator's  log,  where  the  variousheadings  and  corrections  are  listed  as  TH,  variation  (var),  MH,  deviation  (dev),  and  CH.  Thus,  if  anaircraft is flying in an area where the variation is 10o E and the compass has a deviation  of  3o  E,  therelationship would be expressed as follows, assuming a CH of 125o (Figure 3.5):TH138varMHdevCH-10 = 128-3= 125Figure 3.5. To Find True Heading, Work Backwards.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001893.5.3.  Variation.  Variation  has  been  measured  throughout  the  world  and  the  values  found  have  beenplotted  on  charts.  Isogonic  lines  are  printed  on  most  charts  used  in  aerial  navigation  so  that,  if  theaircraft's  approximate  position  is  known,  the  amount  of  variation  can  be  determined  by  visualinterpolation between the printed lines. At high altitudes, these values can be considered quite realistic.Conversely,  at  low  altitudes,  these  magnetic  values  are  less  reliable  because  of  local  anomalies.Variation changes slowly over a period of years and the yearly amount of such change is printed on mostcharts. Variation is also subject to small diurnal (daily) changes which may generally be neglected in airnavigation.3.5.4.  Deviation.  Because  deviation  depends  upon  the  distribution  of  magnetic  forces  in  the  aircraftitself,  it  must  be  obtained  individually  for  each  magnetic  compass  on  each  aircraft.  The  process  ofdetermining deviation, known as compass swinging, should be discussed in the technical order for eachcompass.3.5.4.1.  Deviation  changes  with  heading  (Figure  3.6).  If  the  net  result  of  all  magnetic  forces  of  theaircraft (those forces excluding the earth's field) is represented by a dot located just behind the wings ofthe aircraft. If the aircraft is headed toward MN, the dot attracts one pole of the magnetic compass (inthis case, the South Pole) but, on this heading, does not change its direction. The only effect is to amplifythe directive force of the earth's field. If the aircraft heads toward magnetic east, the dot is now west ofthe compass, and attracts the South Pole of the compass, causing easterly deviation. The illustration inFigure 3.6 also shows that the deviation is zero on a south heading, and westerly when the  aircraft  isheading west.Figure 3.6. Deviation Changes With Heading.3.5.4.2. Deviation can be reduced (but not eliminated) in some direct-indicating magnetic compasses byadjusting the  small  compensating  magnets  in  the  compass  case.  Remaining  deviation  is  referred  to  asresidual  deviation  and  can  be  determined  by  comparison  with  true  values.  This  residual  deviation  is90AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001recorded  on  a  compass  correction  card  showing  actual  deviation  on  various  headings  or  the  compassheadings  as  illustrated  in  Figure  3.7.  From  the  compass  correction  card  illustrated  in  Figure  3.7,  thenavigator knows that to fly a magnetic heading (MH) of 270o, the pilot must steer a compass heading(CH) of 268o.Figure 3.7. Compass Correction Card.3.5.5. Errors in Flight. Unfortunately, deviation is not the only error of a magnetic compass. Additionalerrors are introduced by the motion of the aircraft itself. These errors have minimal effect on the use ofmagnetic compasses and come into play normally during turns or changes in speed. They are mentionedonly to make you aware of the limitations of the basic compass. Although a basic magnetic compass hassome shortcomings, it is simple and reliable. The compass is very useful to both the pilot and navigatorand is carried on all aircraft as an auxiliary compass. Because compass systems are dependent upon theelectrical system of the aircraft, a loss of power means a loss of the compass system. For this reason, anoccasional check on the standby compass provides a excellent backup to the main systems.3.5.6.  Remote-Indicating  Gyro-Stabilized  Magnetic  Compass  System.  A  chief  disadvantage  of  thesimple magnetic compass is its susceptibility to deviation. In remote-indicating gyro-stabilized compasssystems, this difficulty is overcome by locating the compass direction-sensing device outside magneticfields created by electrical circuits in the aircraft. This is done by installing the direction-sensing devicein a remote part of the aircraft, such as the outer extremity of a wing or vertical stabilizer. Indicators ofthe compass system can then be located throughout the aircraft without regard to magnetic disturbances.3.5.6.1. Several kinds of compass systems are used in Air Force aircraft. All include the following fivebasic components: (1) remote compass transmitter, (2) directional gyro (DG), (3) amplifier, (4) headingindicators,  and  (5)  slaving  control.  Though  the  names  of  these  components  vary  among  systems,  theprinciple of operation is identical for each. Thus the N-1 compass system shown in Figure 3.8 can beconsidered typical of all such systems.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 3.8. N-1 Compass System Components.913.5.6.2. The N-1 compass system is designed for airborne use at all latitudes. It can be used either as amagnetic-slaved compass or as a DG. In addition, the N-1 generates an electric signal which is used asan  azimuth  reference  by  the  autopilot,  the  radar  system,  the  navigation  and  bombing  computers,  andvarious compass cards.3.5.7.  Remote  Compass  Transmitter.  The  remote  compass  transmitter  is  the  magnetic-direction-sensing  component  of  the  compass  system  when  the  system  is  in  operation  as  a  magnetic-slavedcompass. The transmitter is located as far from magnetic disturbances of the aircraft as possible, usuallyin  a  wing  tip  or  the  vertical  stabilizer.  The  transmitter  senses  the  horizontal  component  of  the  earth'smagnetic field and electrically transmits it to the master indicator. The compensator, an auxiliary unit ofthe  remote  compass  transmitter,  is  used  to  eliminate  most  of  the  magnetic  deviation  caused  by  theaircraft electrical equipment and  ferrous  metal  when  a  deviation-free  location  for  the  remote  compasstransmitter is not available.3.5.8. Directional Gyro (DG). The DG is the stabilizing component of the compass system when thesystem is in magnetic-slaved operation. When the compass system is in DG operation, the gyro acts asthe directional reference component of the system.3.5.9. Amplifier. The amplifier is the receiving and distributing center of the compass system. Azimuthcorrection and leveling signals originating in the components of the system are each received, amplified,and transmitted by separate channels in the amplifier. Primary power to operate the compass is fed to theamplifier and distributed to the systems components.3.5.10.  Master  Indicator.  The  master  indicator  is  the  heading-indicating  component  of  the  compasssystem. The mechanism in the master indicator integrates all data received from the directional gyro andthe remote compass transmitter, corrects the master indicator heading pointer for azimuth drift of the DGdue to the earth's rotation, and provides takeoff signals for operating remote indicators, radar, navigationcomputers, and directional control of the autopilot.92AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20013.5.10.1. The latitude correction control provides a means for selecting either magnetic-slaved operationor  DG  operation  of  the  compass  system  as  well  as  the  proper  latitude  correction  rate.  The  latitudecorrection  pointer  is  mechanically  connected  to  the  latitude  correction  control  knob  and  indicates  thelatitude setting on the latitude correction scale at the center of the master indicator dial face.3.5.10.2.  The  synchronizer  control  knob  at  the  lower  right-hand  corner  of  the  master  indicator  faceprovides a means of synchronizing the master indicator heading pointer with the correct MH when thesystem is in magnetic-slaved operation. It also provides a means of setting the master indicator headingpointer on the desired gyro heading reference when the system is in DG operation.3.5.10.3. The annunciator pointer indicates the direction in which to rotate the synchronizer control knobto align the heading pointer with the correct MH.3.5.11.  Gyro-Magnetic  Compass  Indicators.  The  gyro-magnetic  compass  indicators  are  remote-reading,  movable  dial  compass  indicators.  They  are  intended  for  supplementary  use  as  directionalcompass indicators when used with the compass system. The indicators duplicate the azimuth heading ofthe master indicator heading pointer. A setting knob is provided at the front of each indicator for rotatingthe dial 360o in either direction without changing the physical alignment of the pointer.3.5.12. Slaving Control. The slaving control is a gyro control rate switch which reduces errors in thecompass system during turns. When the aircraft turns at a rate of 23o or more per minute, the slavingcontrol  prevents  the  remote  compass  transmitter  signal  from  being  transmitted  to  the  compass  systemduring  magnetic-slaved  operation.  It  also  interrupts  leveling  action  in  the  DG  when  the  system  is  inmagnetic-slaved or DG operation.3.6. The Gyro:3.6.1. Basics. Any spinning body exhibits gyroscopic properties. A wheel designed and mounted to usethese properties is called a gyroscope or gyro. Basically, a gyro is a rapidly rotating mass which is free tomove about one or both axes perpendicular to the axis of rotation and to each other. The three axes of agyro (spin, drift, and topple) shown in Figure 3.9 are defined as follows: (1) In a DG, the spin axis oraxis of rotation is mounted horizontally; (2) The topple axis is that axis in the horizontal plane that is 90ofrom the spin axis; (3) The drift axis is that axis 90o vertically from the spin axis.Figure 3.9. Gyroscope Axes.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001933.6.1.1.  Gyroscopic  drift  is  the  horizontal  rotation  of  the  spin  axis  about  the  drift  axis.  Topple  is  thevertical rotating of the spin axis about the topple axis. These two component drifts result in motion ofthe gyro called precession.3.6.1.2.  A  freely  spinning  gyro  tends  to  maintain  its  axis  in  a  constant  direction  in  space,  a  propertyknown as rigidity in space or gyroscopic inertia. Thus, if the spin axis of a gyro were pointed toward astar, it would keep pointing at the star. Actually, the gyro does not move, but the earth moving beneath itgives it an apparent motion. This apparent motion, shown in Figure 3.10, is called apparent precession.The  magnitude  of  apparent  precession  is  dependent  upon  latitude.  The  horizontal  component,  drift,  isequal to 15o per hour times the sine of the latitude, and the vertical component, topple, is equal to 15o perhour times the cosine of the latitude.Figure 3.10. Apparent Precession.3.6.1.3. These computations assume the gyro is stationary with respect to the earth. If the gyro is to beused in a high-speed aircraft, however, it is readily apparent that its speed with respect to a point in spacemay be more or less than the speed of rotation of the earth. If the aircraft in which the gyro is mounted ismoving in the same direction as the earth, the speed of the gyro with respect to space will be greater thanthe earth's speed. The opposite is true if the aircraft is flying in a direction opposite to that of the earth'srotation. This difference in the magnitude of apparent precession caused by transporting the gyro overthe earth is called transport precession.3.6.1.4.  A  gyro  may  precess  because  of  factors  other  than  the  earth's  rotation.  When  this  occurs,  theprecession is labeled real precession. When a force is applied to the plane of rotation of a gyro, the planetends  to  rotate,  not  in  the  direction  of  the  applied  force,  but  90o  around  the  spin  axis  from  it.  Thistorquing  action,  shown  in  Figure  3.11,  may  be  used  to  control  the  gyro  by  bringing  about  a  desiredreorientation  of  the  spin  axis,  and  most  DGs  are  equipped  with  some  sort  of  device  to  introduce  thisforce.  However,  friction  within  the  bearings  of  a  gyro  may  have  the  same  effect  and  cause  a  certain94AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001amount of unwanted precession. Great care is taken in the manufacture and maintenance of gyroscopesto eliminate this factor as much as possible, but, as yet, it has not been possible to eliminate it entirely.Precession  caused  by  the  mechanical  limitations  of  the  gyro  is  called  real  or  induced  precession.  Thecombined  effects  of  apparent  precession,  transport  precession,  and  real  precession  produce  the  totalprecession of the gyro.Figure 3.11. Precession of Gyroscope Resulting From Applied Deflective Force.3.6.1.5.  The  properties  of  the  gyro  that  most  concern  the  navigator  are  rigidity  and  precession.  Byunderstanding these two properties, the navigator is well-equipped to use the gyro as a reliable steeringguide.3.6.2. Directional Gyro (DG). The discussion thus far has been of a universally mounted gyro, free toturn in the horizontal or vertical or any component of these two. This type of gyro is seldom, if ever,used as a DG. When the gyro is used as a steering instrument, it is restricted so that the spin axis remainsparallel  to  the  surface  of  the  earth.  Thus,  the  spin  axis  is  free  to  turn  only  in  the  horizontal  plane(assuming the aircraft normally flies in a near-level attitude), and only the horizontal component (drift)will affect a steering gyro. In the terminology of gyro steering, precession always means the horizontalcomponent of precession.3.6.2.1. The operation of the instrument depends upon the principle of rigidity in space of the gyroscope.Fixed to the plane of the spin axis is a circular compass card, similar to that of the magnetic compass.Since the spin axis remains rigid in space, the points on the card hold the same position in space relativeto the horizontal plane. The case, to which the lubber line is attached, simply revolves about the card.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001953.6.2.2. It is important at this point to understand that the numbers on the compass card have no meaningwithin  themselves,  as  on  the  magnetic  compass.  The  fact  that  the  gyro  may  indicate  100o  under  thelubber line is not an indication that the instrument is actually oriented to magnetic north (MN), or anyother known point. To steer by the gyro, the navigator must first set it to a known direction  or  point.Usually, this is MN or geographic north, though it can be at any known point. If, for example, MN is setas the reference, all headings on the gyro read relative to the position of the magnetic poles.3.6.2.3. The actual setting of the initial reference heading is done by using the principle discussed earlierof torque application to the spinning gyro. By artificially introducing precession, the navigator can setthe gyro to whatever heading is desired and can reset it at any time, by using the same technique.3.6.3. Gyrocompass Errors. The major error affecting the gyro and its use as a steering instrument isprecession. Apparent precession will cause an apparent change of heading equal to 15o per hour timesthe  sine  of  the  latitude.  Real  precession,  caused  by  defects  in  the  gyro,  may  occur  at  any  rate,  but  istypically very small in current gyros. Apparent precession is a known value depending upon location andcan be compensated for. In some of the more complex gyro systems, apparent precession is compensatedfor by setting in a constant correction equal to and in the opposite direction to the precession caused bythe earth's rotation.Section 3D— Altitude and Altimeters3.7. Basics. Altitude may be defined as a vertical distance above some point or plane used as a reference.Knowledge of the aircraft altitude is imperative for terrain clearance, aircraft separation, and a multitudeof operational reasons. There are as many kinds of altitude as there are reference planes from which tomeasure  them.  Only  six  concern  the  navigator:  indicated  altitude,  calibrated  altitude,  pressure  altitude(PA),  density  altitude  (DA),  true  altitude  (TA),  and  absolute  altitude.  There  are  two  main  types  ofaltimeters; the pressure altimeter which is installed in every aircraft, and the absolute or radar altimeter.To understand the pressure altimeter's principle of operation, a knowledge of the standard datum plane isessential.3.8.  Standard  Datum  Plane.  The  standard  datum  plane  is  a  theoretical  plane  where  the  atmosphericpressure is 29.92 inches of mercury (Hg) and the temperature is 15 oC. The standard datum plane is thezero  elevation  level  of  an  imaginary  atmosphere  known  as  the  standard  atmosphere.  In  the  standardatmosphere, pressure is 29.92" Hg at 0 feet and decreases upward at the standard pressure lapse rate. Thetemperature is 15 oC at 0 feet and decreases at the standard temperature lapse rate. Both the pressure andtemperature lapse rates are given in the table in Figure 3.12. The standard atmosphere is theoretical. Itwas derived by averaging the readings taken over a period of many years. The list of altitudes and theircorresponding values of temperature and pressure given in the table were determined by these averages.The  height  of  the  aircraft  above  the  standard  datum  plane  (29.92"  Hg  and  15  oC)  is  called  pressurealtitude (PA) as illustrated in Figure 3.13.96AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 3.12. Standard Lapse Rate Table.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 3.13. Depiction of Altimetry Terms.973.9.  Pressure  Altimeter  Principles  of  Operation.  The  pressure  altimeter  is  an  aneroid  barometercalibrated  to  indicate  feet  of  altitude  instead  of  pressure.  As  shown  in  Figure  3.14,  the  pointers  areconnected by a mechanical linkage to a set of aneroid cells. These aneroid cells expand or contract withchanges  in  barometric  pressure.  In  this  manner,  the  cells  assume  a  particular  thickness  at  a  givenpressure level and, thereby, position the altitude pointers accordingly. On the face of the altimeter is abarometric scale which indicates the barometric pressure (expressed in inches of mercury) of the point orplane from which the instrument is measuring altitude. Turning the barometric pressure set knob on thealtimeter  manually  changes  this  altimeter  setting  on  the  barometric  scale  and  results  in  simultaneousmovement  of  the  altitude  pointers  to  the  corresponding  altitude  reading.  Like  all  measurements,  analtitude reading is  meaningless  if  the  point  from  which  it  starts  is  unknown.  The  face  of  the  pressurealtimeter  supplies  both  values.  The  position  of  the  pointers  indicates  the  altitude  in  feet,  and  thebarometric  pressure  appearing  on  the  barometric  scale  is  that  of  the  reference  plane  above  which  themeasurement is made.98AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 3.14. Altimeter Mechanical Linkage.3.10. Altimeter Displays:3.10.1. Counter-Pointer Altimeter. The counter-pointer altimeter has a two-counter digital display unitlocated in the 9 o'clock position of the dial. The counter indicates altitude in 1,000-foot increments fromzero  to  80,000  feet  (Figure  3.15).  A  single  conventional  pointer  indicates  l00s  of  feet  on  the  fixedcircular  scale.  It  makes  one  complete  revolution  per  1,000  feet  of  altitude  change  and,  as  it  passesthrough the 900 to 1,000-foot area of the dial, the 1,000-foot counter is actuated. The shaft of the 1,000-foot counter in turn actuates the 10,000-foot counter at each 10,000 feet of altitude change. To determinethe indicated altitude, first read the 1,000-foot counter and then add the 100-foot pointer indication.Figure 3.15. Counter-Pointer.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200199CAUTION: It is possible to misinterpret the counter-pointer altimeter by 1,000 feet immediately beforeor  after  the  1,000-foot  counter  moves.  This  error  is  possible  because  the  1,000-foot  counter  changeswhen the 100-foot pointer is between the 900- and 1,000-foot position.3.10.2. Counter-Drum-Pointer Altimeter. Aside from the familiar circular scale and 100-foot pointerthe  counter-drum-pointer  presentation  differs  somewhat  in  appearance  from  the  present  three-pointeraltimeter. Starting at the left of the instrument illustrated in Figure 3.16 and reading from left to right,there are two counter windows and one drum window (white). The numerals presented in the counterwindows indicate 10,000s and 1,000s of feet, respectively. The drum window numbers always follow thepointer number, thereby indicating 100s of feet.3.10.2.1.  Two  methods  may  be  used  to  read  indicated  pressure  altitude  on  the  counter-drum-pointeraltimeter: (1) read the counter-drum window, without referring to the 100-foot pointer, as a direct digitalreadout of both thousands and hundreds of feet; (2) read the two counter indications, without referring tothe drum, and then add the 100-foot pointer indication. The 100-foot pointer serves as a precise readoutof values less than 100 feet.3.10.2.2.  The  differential  air  pressure  which  is  used  to  operate  the  counter-drum-pointer  altimeter  isprocessed by an altitude transducer where it is converted to electrical signals that drive the indicator. Thetransducer  is  also  used  to  send  digital  signals  to  a  transponder  for  purposes  of  automatic  altitudereporting to Air Route Traffic Control  Centers  (ARTCC).  A  standby  system  is  available  for  use  if  anelectrical  malfunction  occurs.  In  the  standby  system,  the  altimeter  receives  static  air  pressure  directlyfrom  the  pitot-static  system.  When  the  instrument  is  operating  in  the  standby  system,  the  wordSTANDBY appears on the instrument face. A switch in the upper right-hand corner of the instrument isprovided  to  return  the  instrument  to  its  normal  mode  of  operation.  This  switch  may  also  be  used  tomanually place the instrument in the STANDBY mode.Figure 3.16. Counter-Drum-Pointer Altimeter.100AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20013.11.  Altimeter  Errors.  The  pressure  altimeter  is  subject  to  certain  errors  which  fall  in  five  generalcategories.3.11.1.  Mechanical  Error.  Mechanical  error  is  caused  by  misalignment  of  gears  and  levers  whichtransmit  the  aneroid  cell  expansion  and  contraction  to  the  pointers  of  the  altimeter.  This  error  is  notconstant and must be checked before each flight by the setting procedure.3.11.2. Scale Error. Scale error is caused by irregular expansion of the aneroid cells and is recorded ona scale correction card maintained for each altimeter in the instrument maintenance shop.3.11.3. Installation or Position Error. An installation or position error is caused by the airflow aroundthe  static  ports.  This  error  varies  with  the  type  of  aircraft,  airspeed,  and  altitude.  The  magnitude  anddirection  of  this  error  can  be  determined  by  referring  to  the  performance  data  section  in  the  aircrafttechnical order. An altimeter correction card is installed in some aircraft which combines the installationor position and scale errors. The card indicates the amount of correction required at different altitudesand airspeeds.WARNING: Installation or position error may be considerable at high speeds and altitudes. Apply thecorrections as outlined in the technical order or on the altimeter correction card.3.11.4. Reversal Error. Reversal error is caused by inducing false static pressure in the static system. Itnormally occurs during abrupt or large pitch changes. This error appears on the altimeter as a momentaryindication in the opposite direction.3.11.5. Hysteresis Error. Hysteresis error is a lag in altitude indication caused by the elastic propertiesof the material within the altimeter. This occurs after an aircraft has maintained a constant altitude for anextended period of time and then makes a large, rapid altitude change. After a rapid descent, altimeterindications are higher than actual. This error is negligible during climbs and descents at slow rate or aftermaintaining a new altitude for a short period of time.3.11.6. Setting the Altimeter. The barometric scale is used to set a reference plane into the altimeter.Rotating  the  barometric  pressure  set  knob  increases  or  decreases  the  scale  reading  and  the  indicatedaltitude.  Each  .01  change  on  the  barometric  scale  is  equal  to  10  feet  of  altitude.  The  majority  ofaltimeters  have  mechanical  stops  at  or  just  beyond  the  barometric  scale  limits  (28.10  to  31.00).Attempting  to  adjust  outside  this  range  may  cause  damage  to  the  instrument.  NOTE:  Altimeters  notequipped  with  mechanical  stops  near  the  barometric  scale  limits  can  be  set  with  a  10,000-foot  error.Therefore,  when  setting  the  altimeter,  ensure  the  10,000-foot  pointer  is  reading  correctly.  Check  thealtimeter for accuracy before every flight. To check and set the altimeter:3.11.6.1. Set the current altimeter setting on the barometric scale.3.11.6.2. Check altimeter at a known elevation and note the error in feet.3.11.6.3. Set the reported altimeter setting on the barometric scale and compare the indicated altitude tothe elevation of a known checkpoint.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011013.12. Nonstandard Atmospheric Effects. The altimeter setting is a correction for nonstandard surfacepressure only. Atmospheric pressure is measured at each station and the value obtained is corrected tosea level according to the surveyed field elevation. Thus, the altimeter setting is the computed sea levelpressure and should be considered valid only in close proximity to the station and the surface. It does notreflect nonstandard temperature nor distortion of atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes.3.13. Types of Altitude:3.13.1. Indicated Altitude. This is the value of altitude that is displayed on the pressure altimeter.3.13.2. Calibrated Altitude. Calibrated altitude is indicated altitude corrected for installation or positionerror.3.13.3. Pressure Altitude (PA). The height above the standard datum plane (29.92" Hg and 15  oC) isPA (Figure 3.13.)3.13.4.  Density  Altitude  (DA).  Density  is  mass  per  unit  volume.  The  density  of  the  air  varies  withtemperature and with height. Warm air expands and is less dense than cold air. Normally, the higher thePA,  the  less  dense  the  air  becomes.  The  density  of  the  air  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  standardatmosphere.  DA  is  the  PA  corrected  for  temperature  in  the  density  altitude  window  of  the  deadreckoning (DR) computer. This calculation converts the density of the air to the standard atmosphericaltitude having the same density. DA is used in performance data and true airspeed (TAS) calculations.3.13.5. True Altitude (TA). TA is the actual vertical distance above mean sea level (MSL), measured infeet. It can be determined by two methods:3.13.5.1. Set the  local  altimeter  setting  on  the  barometric  scale  of  the  pressure  altimeter  to  obtain  theindicated true altitude (ITA). The ITA can then be resolved to TA by use of the DR computer (Figure3.17).3.13.5.2. Measure altitude over water with an absolute altimeter.3.13.6.  Absolute  Altitude.  The  height  above  the  terrain  is  called  absolute  altitude.  It  is  computed  bysubtracting terrain elevation from TA, or it can be read directly from a radar altimeter.3.14. Computer Altitude Solutions. The two altitudes most commonly accomplished on the computerare TA and DA. Nearly all DR computers have a window by which DA can be determined; however, becertain that the window is labeled density altitude.3.14.1. True Altitude (TA) Determination. In the space marked FOR ALTITUDE COMPUTATIONSare two scales: (1) a centigrade scale in the window and (2) a pressure altitude (PA) scale on the upperdisk. When a PA is placed opposite the temperature at that height, all values on the outer (miles) scaleare equal to the corresponding values on the inner (minutes) scale increased or decreased by 2 percentfor each 5.5 oC that the actual temperature differs from the standard temperature at that PA, as set in thewindow. Although the PA is set in the window, the ITA is used on the inner (minutes) scale for findingthe TA, corrected for difference in temperature lapse rate.102EXAMPLE:Given: PA 8,500 feetGiven: ITA 8,000 feetGiven: Air Temperature –16 oCTo Find: TAAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Procedure:  Place  PA  (8,500  feet)  opposite  the  temperature  (-16)  on  the  FOR  ALTITUDECOMPUTATIONS scale. Opposite the ITA (8,000 feet) on the inner scale, read the TA (7,600 feet) onthe outer scale. The solution is illustrated in Figure 3.l7.Figure 3.17. Finding True Altitude.3.14.2. Density Altitude (DA) Determination. DA determination on the computer is accomplished byusing the window just above FOR AIRSPEED AND DENSITY ALTITUDE COMPUTATIONS and thesmall window just above that marked DENSITY ALTITUDE.EXAMPLE:Given: PA 9,000 feetGiven: Air temperature 10o CTo Find: DAProcedure:  Place  pressure  altitude  (9,000  feet)  opposite  air  temperature  (10)  in  window  marked  FORAIRSPEED AND DENSITY ALTITUDE, read DA (10,400 feet). The solution is illustrated in Figure3.18.Figure 3.18. Finding Density Altitude.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Section 3E— Absolute Altimeter1033.15. Basics. Accurate absolute altitude is an important requisite for navigation, airdrop, and bombing aswell as for safe aviating. It is particularly important in pressure pattern navigation. Absolute altitude maybe  computed  from  the  PA  readings  if  the  position  of  the  aircraft  is  known,  but  the  results  are  ofteninaccurate. Under  changing  atmospheric  conditions,  corrections  applied  to  PA  readings  to  obtain  TAsare  only  approximate.  In  addition,  any  error  made  in  determining  the  terrain  elevations  results  in  acorresponding error in the absolute altitude.3.16.  Radar  Altimeter  (High-Level).  A  typical  high-level  radar  altimeter  is  designed  to  indicateabsolute altitude of the aircraft up to 50,000 feet above the terrain, land, or water. This altimeter does notwarn  of  approaching  obstructions,  such  as  mountains,  because  it  measures  altitude  only  to  a  pointdirectly below the aircraft (Figure 3.19).Figure 3.19. Typical High-Level Radar Altimeter.3.16.1.  A  typical  set  consists  of  the  radar  receiver-transmitter,  height  indicator,  and  antenna.  Thetransmitter  section  of  the  receiver-transmitter  unit  develops  recurring  pulses  of  radio  frequency  (RF)energy which are delivered to the transmitter antenna located either flush-mounted or on the underside ofthe  aircraft.  The  transmitter  antenna  radiates  the  pulsed  energy  downward  to  reflect  off  the  earth  andreturn to the receiver antenna on the aircraft. The time consumed between transmission and reception ofthe RF pulse is determined only by the absolute altitude of the aircraft above the terrain since the radiowave velocity is constant.3.16.2. The receiver antenna delivers the returned pulse to the receiver section of the receiver-transmitterunit  where  it  is  amplified  and  detected  for  presentation  on  the  indicator  unit.  The  radar  altimeterindicator displays absolute altitude which is used in pressure pattern navigation, terrain clearance, or as abackup for the PA.104AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20013.17.  Radar  Altimeter  (Low-Level).  This  type  altimeter  provides  a  dial  or  digital  indication  of  thealtitude of the aircraft above the terrain. It is designed to eliminate the necessity of adding antennas orany  other  equipment  external  to  the  surface  of  the  aircraft.  This  equipment  may  also  be  used  inconjunction with automatic pilot or other devices requiring altitude limit data.3.17.1. Systems vary widely, but typically include a receiver-transmitter, height indicator, and electroniccontrol  amplifier.  The  height  indicator  contains  the  only  operating  control  on  the  equipment.  Thisinstrument normally gives altitude readings up to 35,000 feet. If the instrument has an analog scale, themarkings are usually logarithmic, graduated for the low altitude portion of its range. A variable altitudelimit indicator system is included to provide an indication of flight below a preset altitude.3.17.2.  To  operate  the  equipment,  turn  the  ON-LIMIT  control  to  ON.  After  warmup,  the  terrainclearance  of  the  aircraft  within  the  range  of  0–20,000  is  read  directly  from  the  single  pointer  on  theindicator as shown in Figure 3.20. This pointer can be preset to any desired altitude by the ON-LIMITcontrol  and  is  used  as  a  reference  for  flying  at  fixed  altitudes.  The  altitude  can  be  maintained  byobserving  the  position  of  the  pointer  with  respect  to  the  small  triangular  marker  instead  of  the  actualaltitude  scale.  In  addition,  a  red  light  on  the  front  of  the  indicator  lights  up  when  the  aircraft  is  at  orbelow  the  preset  altitude.  To  turn  off  the  equipment,  it  is  only  necessary  to  turn  off  the  ON-LIMITcontrol on the indicator.Figure 3.20. Low-Level Radar Altimeter.Section 3F— Temperature3.18. Basics. Determination of correct temperature is necessary for accurate computation of airspeed andaltitude.  Temperature,  airspeed,  and  altitude  are  all  closely  interrelated,  and  the  navigator  must  befamiliar with each in order to work effectively and accurately.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011053.19. Temperature Gauges. The temperature gauge most commonly used in the Air Force employs abimetallic element. The instrument is a single unit consisting of a stainless steel stem which projects intothe airstream and a head which contains the pointer and scale. The sensitive element in the outside endof the stem is covered by a radiation shield of brightly polished metal to cut down the amount of heatthat  the  element  might  absorb  by  direct  radiation  from  the  sun.  The  bimetallic  element  (called  thesensitive element) is so named because it consists of two strips of different metal alloys welded together.When the element is heated, one alloy expands more rapidly than the other causing this element, whichis shaped like a coil spring, to turn. This, in turn, causes the indicator needle to move on the pointer dial.Temperatures between –60 oC and 50 oC can be measured on this type of gauge.3.20.  Temperature  Scales.  In  the  United  States,  temperature  is  usually  expressed  in  terms  of  theFahrenheit  scale  (oF).  In  aviation,  temperature  is  customarily  measured  on  the  centigrade,  or  Celsius(oC), scale.3.20.1.  Although  aircraft  thermometers  are  usually  calibrated  in  oC,  it  is  sometimes  necessary  tointerconvert Fahrenheit and centigrade temperatures. The following formulas may be used:oF = (1.8 X oC) + 32ooC = (oF - 32o) / 1.83.20.2. Temperature error is the total effect of scale error and heat of compression error. Scale error issimply an erroneous reading of the pointer under standard conditions. It is difficult for a crewmember toevaluate this error without sensitive testing equipment. With this in mind, the reading of the indicator isconsidered correct and is called indicated air temperature (IAT).3.20.3. The second error, heat of compression  error,  causes  the  instrument  to  read  too  warm.  Heatingoccurs at high speeds from friction and the compression of air on the forward edge of the temperatureprobe. Thus, the IAT is always corrected by a minus correction factor to produce true air temperature(TAT).  Heat  of  compression  increases  with  TAS.  The  TAT  can  be  obtained  from  the  aircraft  flightmanual.Section 3G— Airspeed3.21. Basics. Airspeed is the speed of the aircraft in relation to the airmass surrounding that aircraft.3.22. Pitot-Static System. Accurate airspeed measurement is obtained by means of a pitot-static system.The system consists of: (1) a tube mounted parallel to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft in an area thatis free of turbulent air generated by the aircraft, and (2) a static source that provides still, or undisturbed,air pressure.3.22.1. Ram and static pressures may be taken from a single pitot-static tube or from completely separatesources. A pitot-static tube usually has a baffle plate, as shown in Figure 3.21, to reduce turbulence andto prevent rain, ice, and dirt from entering the tube. There may be one or more drain holes in the bottomof  the  tube  to  dispose  of  condensed  moisture.  A  built-in  electrical  heating  element,  controlled  by  aswitch inside the aircraft, prevents the formation of ice in the tube.106AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20013.22.2.  Reasonable  care  should  be  taken  with  the  pitot-static  system  to  ensure  continuous,  reliableservice.  The  drain  holes  should  be  checked  periodically  to  ensure  they  are  not  clogged.  At  thecompletion of each flight, a cover is placed over the intake end of the tube to prevent foreign objects andmoisture from collecting in the tube.Figure 3.21. Operating Principle of the Airspeed Indicator.3.23.  Principles  of  Operation  of  Airspeed  Indicators.  The  heart  of  the  airspeed  indicator  is  adiaphragm which is sensitive to pressure changes. Figure 3.21 shows it located inside the indicator caseand connected to the ram air source in the pitot tube. The indicator case is sealed airtight and connectedto the static pressure source. The differential pressure created by the relative effects of the impact andstatic pressures on the diaphragm causes it to expand or contract. As the speed of the aircraft increases,the  impact  pressure  increases,  causing  the  diaphragm  to  expand.  Through  mechanical  linkage,  theexpansion is displayed as an increase in airspeed. This principle is used in the IAS meter, the TAS meter,and the Machmeter.3.24. Airspeed Definitions. There are many reasons for the difference between IAS and TAS. Some ofthe  reasons  are  the  error  in  the  mechanical  makeup  of  the  instrument,  the  error  caused  by  incorrectinstallation, and the fact that density and pressure of the atmosphere vary from standard conditions.3.24.1. Indicated Airspeed (IAS). IAS is the uncorrected reading taken from the face of the indicator. Itis the airspeed that the instrument shows on the dial.3.24.2. Basic Airspeed (BAS). BAS is the IAS corrected for instrument error. Each airspeed indicatorhas its own characteristics which cause it to differ from any other airspeed indicator. These differencesmay  be  caused  by  slightly  different  hairspring  tensions,  flexibility  of  the  diaphragm,  accuracy  of  thescale markings, or even the effect of temperature on the different metals in the indicator mechanism. Theeffect of temperature introduces an instrument error due to the variance in the coefficient of expansion ofAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001107the different metals comprising the working mechanisms. This error can be removed by the installationof a bimetallic compensator within the mechanical linkage. This bimetallic compensator is installed andproperly set at the factory, thereby eliminating the temperature error within the instrument. The accuracyof the airspeed indicator is also affected by the length and curvature of the pressure line from the pitottube.  These  installation  errors  must  be  corrected  mathematically.  Installation,  scale,  and  instrumenterrors are all combined under one title called instrument error. Instrument error is factory-determined tobe  within  specified  tolerances  for  various  airspeeds.  It  is  considered  negligible  or  is  accounted  for  intechnical order tables and graphs.3.24.3. Calibrated Airspeed (CAS). CAS is basic airspeed corrected for pitot-static error or attitude ofthe aircraft. The pitot-static system of a moving aircraft will have some error. Minor errors will be foundin the pitot section of the system. The major difficulty is encountered in the static pressure section. Asthe flight attitude of the aircraft changes, the pressure at the static inlets changes. This is caused by theairstream  striking  the  inlet  at  an  angle.  Different  types  and  locations  of  installations  cause  differenterrors.  It  is  immaterial  whether  the  status  source  is  located  in  the  pitot-static  head  or  at  some  flushmounting on the aircraft. This error will be essentially the same for all aircraft of the same model, and acorrection can be computed by referring to tables in the appendix of the flight manual.3.24.4.  Equivalent  Airspeed  (EAS).  EAS  is  CAS  corrected  for  compressibility.  Compressibilitybecomes noticeable when the airspeed is great enough to create an impact pressure which causes the airmolecules to be compressed within the impact chamber of the pitot tube. The amount of the compressionis directly proportionate to the impact pressure. As the air is compressed, it causes the dynamic pressureto  be  greater  than  it  should  be.  Therefore,  the  correction  is  a  negative  value.  The  correction  forcompressibility error can be determined by referring to the performance data section of the aircraft flightmanual or by using the F-correction factor on the DR computer.3.24.5.  Density  Airspeed  (DAS).  DAS  is  calibrated  airspeed  corrected  for  pressure  altitude  (PA)  andtrue air temperature (TAT). Pitot pressure varies not only with airspeed but also with air density. As thedensity of the atmosphere decreases with height, pitot pressure for a given airspeed must also decreasewith  height.  Thus,  an  airspeed  indicator  operating  in  a  less  dense  medium  than  that  for  which  it  wascalibrated will indicate an airspeed lower than true speed. The higher the aircraft flies, the greater thediscrepancy.  The  necessary  correction  can  be  found  on  the  DR  computer.  Using  the  window  on  thecomputer above the area marked FOR AIRSPEED DENSITY ALTITUDE COMPUTATIONS, set thePA against the TAT. Opposite the CAS on the minutes scale, read the DAS on the miles scale. At lowerairspeeds  and  altitudes,  DAS  may  be  taken  as  true  airspeed  with  negligible  error.  However,  at  highspeeds  and  altitudes,  this  is  no  longer  true  and  compressibility  error  must  be  considered.(Compressibility  error  is  explained  in  the  equivalent  airspeed  section.)  When  density  altitude  (DA)  ismultiplied by the compressibility factor, the result is true airspeed.3.24.6. True Airspeed (TAS). TAS is equivalent airspeed that has been corrected for air density error.By correcting EAS for TAT and PA, the navigator compensates for air density error and computes anaccurate value of TAS. The TAS increases with altitude when the IAS remains constant. When the TASremains constant, the IAS decreases with altitude. CAS and EAS can be determined by referring to theperformance data section of the aircraft flight manual.3.25. Computing True Airspeed:108AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20013.25.1. ICE-T Method. To compute TAS using the ICE-T method on the DR computer, solve, for eachtype of airspeed, in the order of I, C, E, and T; that is, change IAS to CAS, change CAS to EAS, andchange EAS to TAS. This process is illustrated by the following sample problem. (Refer to definitions asnecessary.)Given: PA: 30.000'Given: Temperature: -37 oCGiven: IAS: 253 knotsGiven: Flight Manual Correction Factor: 2 knotsFind: CASFind: EASFind: TASAnswer: CAS is determined by algebraically adding to IAS the correction factor taken from the chart inyour flight manual. (This correction is insignificant at low speeds but can be higher than 10 knots nearMach 1.)3.25.1.1. To correct CAS to EAS, use the chart on the slide of the computer entitled F-CORRECTIONFACTORS  FOR  TAS.  See  Figure  3.22.  Enter  the  chart  with  CAS  and  PA.  The  F  factor  is  .96.  Thismeans we multiply CAS by .96 or take 96 percent of 255 knots. To do this, place 255 knots on the innerscale under the 10 index on the outer scale. Locate 96 on the outer scale and read EAS on the inner scale:245 knots.3.25.1.2. Now, we need  to  correct  EAS  for  temperature  and  altitude  to  get  TAS.  As  shown  in  Figure3.22, in the window marked FOR AIRSPEED AND DENSITY ALTITUDE COMPUTATIONS, placetemperature over PA. Locate the EAS of 245 knots on the inner scale and read TAS on the outer scale.The TAS is 408 knots.3.25.2.  Alternate  TAS  Method.  There  is  an  alternate  method  of  finding  TAS  when  given  CAS.  Theinstructions for alternate solution are printed on the computer directly below the F factor table (MultiplyF Factor by TAS obtained with computer to obtain TAS corrected  for compressibility). Mathematically,your answer should be the same regardless of the procedure you use, but the ICE-T method is used mostoften because the computation can be worked backwards from TAS. If you wish to maintain a constantTAS,  you  can  determine  what  IAS  to  fly  by  working  the  ICE-T  method  in  reverse  (also  known  asReverse ICE-T), as illustrated in Figure 3.23.3.26.  Machmeters.  Machmeters  indicate  the  ratio  of  aircraft  speed  to  the  speed  of  sound  at  anyparticular altitude and temperature during flight. It is often necessary to convert TAS to a Mach numberor vice versa. Instructions are clearly written on the computer in the center portion of the circular sliderule. Locate the window marked FOR AIRSPEED AND DENSITY ALTITUDE COMPUTATIONS androtate  the  disk  until  the  window  points  to  the  top  of  the  computer  (toward  the  l0  index  on  the  outerscale). Within the window is an arrow entitled MACH NO. INDEX (Figure 3.24). To obtain TAS from agiven Mach number, set air temperature over the MACH NO. INDEX and, opposite the Mach numberon the MINUTES scale, read the TAS on the outer scale.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001109EXAMPLE:  If  you  are  planning  to  maintain  Mach  1.2  on  a  cross-country  flight,  place  the  airtemperature at flight altitude over the MACH NO. INDEX. Read the TAS on the outer scale opposite 1.2on the inner scale. If the temperature is –20 oC, the TAS will be 742 knots.Figure 3.22. ICE-T Method.Figure 3.23. ICE-T in Reverse.110AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20013.27.  Airspeed  Indicators.  The  combined  airspeed-Mach  indicator,  shown  in  Figure  3.25,  is  usuallyfound in high-performance aircraft or where instrument panel space is limited. It simultaneously displaysIAS,  indicated  Mach  number,  and  maximum  allowable  airspeed.  It  contains  a  differential  pressurediaphragm  and  two  aneroid  cells.  The  diaphragm  drives  the  airspeed-Mach  pointer.  One  aneroid  cellrotates the Mach scale, permitting IAS and Mach number to be read simultaneously. The second aneroidcell  drives  the  maximum  allowable  airspeed  pointer.  This  pointer  is  preset  to  the  aircraft's  maximumIAS.  Unlike  the  maximum  IAS  and  unlike  the  maximum  allowable  airspeed,  Mach  number  increaseswith altitude. An airspeed marker set knob positions a movable airspeed marker. This marker serves as amemory reference for desired airspeed.Figure 3.24. Finding True Airspeed From Mach Number.Figure 3.25. Combined Airspeed-Mach Indicator.3.28. Air Data Computer. The air data computer is an electro-pneumatic unit that uses pitot and staticpressures and total air temperature to compute outputs for various systems. These output parameters ofvoltage and resistance represent functions of altitude, Mach number, TAS, computed airspeed, and staticAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001111air temperature. Air data computer outputs are used with the flight director computers, automatic flightcontrols, cabin pressurization equipment, and normal basic indicators. The air data computer providesextreme accuracy and increased reliability.3.29.  Doppler.  Doppler  radar  provides  the  navigator  with  continuous,  instantaneous,  and  accuratereadings of groundspeed (GS) and drift angle in all weather conditions, both over land and water. It doesthis  automatically  with  equipment  that  is  of  practical  size  and  weight.  Its  operation  makes  use  of  theDoppler effect.3.29.1. Two basic Doppler radar systems exist—the four-beam and the three-beam. Both types use eithercontinuous  wave  (CW)  or  pulse  wave  (PW)  transmission.  CW  transmission  requires  one  antenna  fortransmission  and  a  second  antenna  for  reception.  Both  use  an  X-shaped  beam  configuration.Groundspeed is computed by comparing Doppler shift between front and rear beams, and drift angle iscomputed by comparing the shift between the left and right beams.3.29.2. Doppler is not the only source of drift angle and GS. The same basic information is available onvirtually all Inertial Navigation Systems, and now Global Positioning System computers can also giveaccurate information under a wider range of conditions.3.30.  Summary.  While  the  operation  of  some  of  the  equipment  in  this  chapter  seems  crude  andprimitive compared to state-of-the-art navigation computers currently in use, these instruments still havetwo very important uses—they act as crosschecks to ensure the computers are functioning properly, andthey become your primary means of navigation when the computers aren't.112AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Chapter 4DEAD RECKONING (DR)Section 4A— Basic Navigation4.1. Dead Reckoning (DR).  Having discussed the basic instruments available to the navigator, we willnow  review  the  mechanics  of  DR  procedures,  plotting,  determining  wind  effect,  and  MB-4  computersolutions.  Using  basic  skills  in  DR  procedures,  a  navigator  can  predict  aircraft  positions  in  the  eventmore reliable navigation equipment is unavailable or not operative. Therefore, a good foundation in DRis imperative for the navigator.4.2. Plotting. Chart work should be an accurate and graphic picture of the progress of the aircraft fromdeparture to destination and, with the log, should serve as a complete record of the flight. Thus, it alsofollows that the navigator must be familiar with and use accepted standard symbols and labels on chartsas shown in Figure 4.1. (See Attachment 3 for additional chart and navigation symbols.)Figure 4.1. Standard Plotting Symbols.4.3. Terms Explained. Several terms have been mentioned in earlier portions of this pamphlet. Precisedefinitions of these terms must now be understood before the mechanics of chart work are learned.4.3.1.  True  Course  (TC).  The  intended  horizontal  direction  of  travel  over  the  surface  of  the  earth,expressed as an angle measured clockwise from true north (000o) through 360o.4.3.2.  Course  Line.  The  horizontal  component  of  the  intended  path  of  the  aircraft  comprising  bothdirection and magnitude or distance.4.3.3. Track. The horizontal component of the actual path of the aircraft over the surface of the earthTrack may, but very seldom does, coincide with the TC or intended path of the aircraft. The differencebetween the two is caused by an inability to predict perfectly all in-flight conditions.4.3.4. True Heading (TH). The horizontal direction in which an aircraft is pointed. More precisely, it isthe angle measured clockwise from true north through 360o to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft. Thedifference between track and TH is caused by wind and is called drift.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011134.3.5. Groundspeed (GS). The speed of the aircraft over the  ground. It may be  expressed in nauticalmiles (NM), statute miles, or kilometers (km) per hour, but, as a navigator, you will use NM per hour(knots).4.3.6. True Airspeed (TAS). The rate  of  motion  of  an  aircraft  relative  to  the  airmass  surrounding  it.Since the airmass is usually in motion in relation to the ground, airspeed and GS seldom are the same.4.3.7. Dead Reckoning Position (DR Position). A point in relation to the earth established by keepingan accurate account of time, GS, and track since the last known position. It may also be defined as theposition obtained by applying wind effect to the TH and TAS of the aircraft.4.3.8. Fix. A position determined from terrestrial, electronic, or astronomical data.4.3.9. Air Position (AP). The location of the aircraft in relation to the airmass surrounding it. TH andTAS are the components of the vector used to establish an AP.4.3.10. Most Probable Position (MPP). A position determined with partial reference to a DR positionand partial reference to a fixing aid.4.4. Plotting Equipment. A fine-tipped pencil, a good pair of dividers, and a plotter are imperative foraccurate chart work.4.4.1. Dividers. Dividers should be manipulated with one hand, leaving the other free to use the plotter,pencil, or chart as necessary. Some navigation dividers have  a tension screw which you  can  adjust toprevent the dividers from becoming either too stiff or too loose for convenient use. Adjust the points ofthe dividers to approximately equal length. A small screwdriver, required for these adjustments, shouldbe a part of the navigator's equipment.4.4.2. Plotter. A common plotter is shown in Figure 4.2. This plotter is a semicircular protractor with astraight edge attached to it. A small hole at the base of the protractor portion indicates the center of thearc of the angular scale. Two complete scales cover the outer edge of the protractor and are graduated indegrees.  An  abbreviated  inner  scale  measures  the  angle  from  the  vertical  (Figures  4.3  and  4.4).  Theangle measured is the angle between the meridian and the straight line. The outer scale is used to read allangles between north through east to south, and the inner scale is used to read all angles between souththrough west to north.4.5. Plotting Procedures for Mercator Charts:4.5.1.  Preparation.  Many  charts  and  plotting  sheets  are  printed  on  the  Mercator  projection.  Beforestarting any plot, note the scale and projection of the chart and check the date to make sure that it is thelatest edition. The latitude scale is used to represent NM. The longitude scale should never be used tomeasure distance. Some charts carry a linear scale in the margin, and, where present, it indicates that thesame scale may be used anywhere on the chart.114Figure 4.2. Typical Plotter.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 4.3. Measuring True Course.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001115Figure 4.4. Measuring True Course Near 180o or 360o.4.5.2.  Plotting  Positions.  On  most  Mercator  charts,  the  spacing  between  meridians  and  parallels  iswidely spaced, necessitating the use of dividers. There are several methods by which positions can beplotted on Mercator charts. One method is illustrated in Figure 4.5. Place the straight edge of the plotterin  a  vertical  position  at  the  desired  longitude.  Set  the  dividers  to  the  desired  number  of  minutes  oflatitude. Hold one point against the straight edge on the parallel of latitude corresponding to the wholedegree of latitude given. Let the other point also rest against the straight edge and lightly prick the chart.This marks the desired position. In measuring the latitude and longitude of a position already plotted,reverse the procedure.4.5.3. Plotting and Measuring Courses:4.5.3.1. Step 1—Plot departure and destination on the chart as shown in Figure 4.6.4.5.3.2. Step 2—Draw  the  course  line  between  the  two  points.  If  they  are  close  together,  the  straightedge of the plotter can be used. If they are far apart, two plotters can be used together or a longer straightedge  can  be  used.  If  none  of  these  methods  is  adequate,  fold  the  edge  of  the  charts  so  that  the  foldconnects  the  departure  and  destination  points,  and  make  a  series  of  pencil  marks  along  the  edge.  Aplotter  or  straight  edge  can  then  be  used  to  connect  the  points  where  the  chart  is  unfolded.  After  thecourse line has been plotted, the next step is to determine its direction.116AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 4.5. Plotting Positions on a Mercator.Figure 4.6. Reading Direction of a Course Line.4.5.3.3. Step 3—Place the points of the dividers or a pencil anywhere along the line to be measured.4.5.34. Step 4—Place the plotter against the dividers.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011174.5.3.5. Step 5—Slide the plotter until the center hole is over the midmeridian. Make a mental estimateof the approximate direction to avoid obtaining a reciprocal course.4.5.3.6. Step 6—Read TC on the protractor at the meridian. Using the midmeridian will give an averageTC for the leg.4.5.4. Plotting Course From Given Position. A course from a given position can be plotted quickly inthe following manner: Place the point of a pencil on the position and slide the plotter along this point,rotating it as necessary, until  the  center  hole  and  the  figure  on  the  protractor  representing  the  desireddirection  are  lined  up  with  the  same  meridian.  Hold  the  plotter  in  place  and  draw  the  line  along  thestraight edge (Figure 4.7).Figure 4.7. Plotting Course From Given Position.4.5.5.  Measuring  Distance.  One  of  the  disadvantages  of  the  Mercator  chart  is  the  lack  of  a  constantscale. If the two points between which the distance is to be measured are approximately in a north-southdirection  and  the  total  distance  between  them  can  be  spanned,  the  distance  can  be  measured  on  thelatitude scale opposite the midpoint. However, the total distance between any two points that do not lieapproximately north or south of each other should not be spanned unless the distance is short.4.5.5.1. In the measurement of long distances, select a midlatitude lying approximately halfway betweenthe latitudes of the two points. By using dividers set to a convenient, reasonably short distance, such as60 NM picked off at the midlatitude scale, you may determine an approximate distance by marking offunits along the line to be measured, as shown in Figure 4.8.118Figure 4.8. Midlatitude Scale.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20014.5.5.2. The scale at the midlatitude is accurate enough if the course line does not cover more than 5o oflatitude  (somewhat  less  in  high  latitudes).  If  the  course  line  exceeds  this  amount  or  if  it  crosses  theequator, divide it into two or more legs and measure the length of each  leg  with  the  scale  of  its  ownmidlatitude.4.6. Plotting Procedures for Lambert Conformal and Gnomonic Charts:4.6.1. Plotting Positions. On a Lambert conformal chart the meridians are not parallel as on a Mercatorchart. Therefore, plotting a position by the method described under Mercator charts may not be accurate.On small scale charts or where there is marked convergence, the plotter should intersect two graduatedparallels  of  latitude  at  the  desired  longitude  rather  than  parallel  to  the  meridian.  Then,  mark  off  thedesired latitude with your dividers. On a large scale chart, the meridians are so nearly parallel that thisprecaution is unnecessary. The scale on all parts of a Lambert conformal chart is essentially constant.Therefore, it is not absolutely necessary to pick off minutes of latitude near any particular parallel exceptin the most precise work.4.6.2.  Plotting  and  Measuring  Courses.  Any  straight  line  plotted  on  a  Lambert  conformal  chart  isapproximately an arc of a great circle. On long distance flights, this feature is advantageous since thegreat circle course line can be plotted as easily as a rhumb line on a Mercator chart.4.6.2.1. However, for shorter distances where the difference between the great circle and rhumb line isnegligible, the rhumb line is more desirable because a constant heading can be held. For such distances,the approximate direction of the rhumb line course can be found by measuring the great circle course atmidmeridian as shown in Figure 4.9. In this case, the track is not quite the same as that indicated by thecourse line drawn on the chart, since the actual track (a rhumb line) appears as a curve convex to theequator on a Lambert conformal chart, while the course line (approximately a great circle) appears as astraight line. Near midmeridian, the two have  approximately the same direction  (except  for  very  longdistances) along an oblique course line as indicated in Figure 4.10.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001119Figure 4.9. Use Midmeridian to Measure Course on a Lambert Conformal.Figure 4.10. At Midmeridian, R/L and G/Circle Have Approximately the Same Direction.4.6.2.2.  For  long  distances  involving  great  circle  courses,  it  is  not  possible  to  change  headingcontinually, as is necessary when following a great circle exactly, and it is customary to divide the greatcircle  into  a  series  of  legs,  each  covering  about  5o  of  longitude.  The  direction  of  the  rhumb  lineconnecting the ends of each leg is found at its midmeridian.4.6.3. Measuring Distance. As previously stated, the scale on a Lambert conformal chart is practicallyconstant, making it possible to use any part of a meridian graduated in minutes of latitude to measureNM.4.6.4.  Plotting  on  a  Gnomonic  Chart.  Gnomonic  charts  are  used  mainly  for  planning  great  circleroutes. Since any straight line on a gnomonic chart is an arc of a great circle, a straight line drawn fromthe point of departure to destination will give a great circle route. Once obtained, this great circle route istransferred to a Mercator chart by breaking the route into segments as shown in Figure 4.11.4.6.5.  Plotting  Hints.  The  following  suggestions  should  prove  helpful  in  developing  good  plottingprocedures:120AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 4.11. Transferring Great Circle Route From Gnomonic to Mercator Chart.4.6.5.1. Measure all directions and distances carefully. Double-check all measurements, computations,and positions.4.6.5.2. Avoid plotting unnecessary lines. If a line serves no purpose, erase it.4.6.5.3. Keep plotting equipment in good working order. If the plotter is broken, replace it. Keep sharppoints on dividers. Use a sharp pencil and an eraser that will not smudge.4.6.5.4. Draw light lines at first, as they may have to be  erased. When the line has been checked  andproven to be correct, then darken it if desired.4.6.5.5.  Label  lines  and  points  immediately  after  they  are  drawn.  Use  standard  labels  and  symbols.Letter the labels legibly. Be neat and exact.Section 4B— DR Computer4.7.  Basics.  Almost  any  type  of  navigation  requires  the  solution  of  simple  arithmetical  problemsinvolving time, speed, distance, fuel consumption, and so forth. In addition, the effect of the wind on theaircraft must be known; therefore, the wind must be computed. To solve such problems quickly and withreasonable  accuracy,  various  types  of  computers  have  been  devised.  The  computer  described  in  thispamphlet is simply a combination of two devices: (1) a circular slide rule for the solution of arithmeticalproblems (Figure 4.12), and (2) a specially designed instrument for the graphical solution of the windproblem (Figure 4.13).4.7.1. The slide rule is a standard device for the mechanical solution of various arithmetical problems.Slide rules operate on the basis of logarithms. Slide rules are either straight or circular; the one on theDR computer is circular.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011214.7.2. The slide rule face of the computer consists of two flat metallic disks, one of which can be rotatedaround a common center. These disks are graduated near their edges with adjacent logarithmic scales toform a circular slide rule approximately  equivalent to a straight, 12-inch slide  rule. Because the outerscale usually represents a number of miles and the inner scale represents a number of minutes, they arecalled the miles scale and the minutes or time scale, respectively (Figure 4.12).Figure 4.12. Dead Reckoning Computer Slide Rule Face.4.7.3. The numbers on each scale represent the printed figure with the decimal point moved any numberof places to the right or left. For example, the numbers on either scale can represent 1.2, l2, 120, 1200,etc.4.7.4.  Since  speed  (or  fuel  consumption)  is  expressed  in  miles  (or  gallons  or  pounds)  per  hour  (60minutes), a large black arrow marked speed index is placed at the 60-minute mark.4.7.5. Graduations of both scales are identical. The graduations are numbered from l0 to 100 and the unitintervals decrease in size as the numbers increase in size. Not all unit intervals are numbered. The firstelement of skill in using the computer is a sure knowledge of how to read the numbers.4.8.  Reading  the  Slide  Rule  Face.  The  unit  intervals  that  are  numbered  present  no  difficulty.  Theproblem  lies  in  giving  the  correct  values  to  the  many  small  lines  that  come  between  the  numberedintervals. There are no numbers given between 25 and 30 as shown in Figure 4.14, for example, but it isobvious that the larger intermediate divisions are 26, 27, 28, and 29. Between 25 and (unnumbered) 26,there  are  five  smaller  divisions,  each  of  which  would,  therefore,  be  .2  of  the  larger  unit.  A  mentalestimate will aid in placing the decimal point.122AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 4.13. Dead Reckoning Computer Wind Face.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 4.14. Reading the Slide Rule Face.1234.9. Problems on the Slide Rule Face:4.9.1. Simple  Proportion. The slide  rule  face  of  the  computer  is  so  constructed  that  any  relationshipbetween two numbers, one on the miles scale and one on the minutes scale, will hold true for all othernumbers on the two scales. Thus, if the two 10s are placed opposite each other, all other numbers will beidentical  around  the  circle.  If  20  on  the  minutes  scale  is  placed  opposite  10  on  the  miles  scale,  allnumbers  on  the  minutes  scale  will  be  double  of  those  on  the  miles  scale.  This  feature  allows  one  tosupply  the  fourth  term  of  any  mathematical  proportion.  Thus,  the  unknown  in  the  equation  could  besolved on the computer by setting 18 on the miles scale over 45 on the minutes scale and reading theanswer (32) above the 80 on the minutes scale. It is this relationship that makes possible the solution oftime-speed-distance  problems.  This  can  also  be  solved  algebraically:  (45X=18x80 thereforeX=[18x80]/45).4.9.2. Time, Speed, and Distance:4.9.2.1. An aircraft has traveled 24 miles in 8 minutes. How many minutes will be required to travel 150miles? This is a simple proportion which can be written as:Setting the 24 over the 8 on the computer as illustrated in Figure 4.15 and reading under the 150, we findthe answer to be 50 minutes.4.9.2.2. A problem that often occurs is to find the GS of the aircraft when a given distance is traveled ina given time. This is solved in the same manner, except the computer is marked with a speed index toaid  in  finding  the  correct  proportion.  In  the  problem  just  stated,  if  24  is  set  over  8  as  in  the  originalproblem, the GS of the aircraft, 180 knots, is read above the speed index as shown.Given:Find:GS 204 knotsDistance traveled in 1 hour 15 minutes (75 minutes)124AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Solution: Set the speed index on the minutes scale to 204 on the miles scale. Opposite 75 on the minutesscale, read 255 NM on the miles scale. The computer solution is shown in Figure 4.16. The solutions fortime  and  speed  when  the  other  variables  are  known  follow  the  same  basic  format  (Figures  4.17  and4.18).Figure 4.15. Solve for X.Figure 4.16. Solving for Distance When Speed and Time Are Known.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001125Figure 4.17. Solving for Time When Speed and Distance Are Known.Figure 4.18. Solving for Speed When Time and Distance Are Known.4.9.3.  Seconds  Index.  Since  1  hour  is  equivalent  to  3,600  seconds,  a  subsidiary  index  mark,  calledseconds index, is marked at 36 on the minutes scale of some computers. When placed opposite a speedon the miles scale, the index relates the scales for converting distance to time in seconds. Thus, if 36 isplaced opposite a GS of 144 knots, 50 seconds is required to go 2 NM; and in 150 seconds (2 minutes 30seconds), 6.0 NM are covered. Similarly, if 4 NM are covered in 100 seconds, GS is 144 knots (Figure4.19).4.9.4.  Conversion  of  Distance.  Subsidiary  indexes  are  placed  on  some  computers  to  aid  in  theconversion of distances  from  one  unit  of  measure  to  another.  The  most  common  interconversions  arethose involving statute miles, NM, and kms.126Figure 4.19. Seconds Index.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20014.9.5.  Statute-NM  Interconversion.  The  miles  scale  of  the  computer  is  marked  with  a  statute  mileindex at 76 and a NM index at 66. The units are interconverted by setting the known distance under theappropriate index and reading the desired unit under the other.EXAMPLE: To convert 136 statute miles to NMs, set 136 on the minutes scale under the STAT indexon the miles scale. Under the NAUT index on the miles scale, read the number of NMs (118) on theminutes scale (Figure 4.20).Figure 4.20. Statute Mile, Nautical Mile, and Kilometer Interconversion.4.9.6.  Conversion  of  Nautical  Miles  (NM)  or  Statute  Miles  to  Kilometers  (km).  A  km  index  isindicated on the miles scale of the computer at 122. When NM or statute miles are placed under theirappropriate index on the miles scale, kms may be read, on the minutes scale, under the km index.EXAMPLE: To convert 118 NM to kms, place 118 on the minutes scale under the NAUT index on themiles scale. Under the km index on the miles scale, read kms (218) on the minutes scale.4.9.7. Multiplication and Division. To multiply two numbers, for example 12 X 2, the index (printed as10 on the minutes scale) is placed opposite one of the numbers to be multiplied (12), and the product(24) is read on the miles scale above the other number (2) on the minutes scale (Figure 4.21).AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011274.9.7.1.  To  divide  one  number  by  another,  for  example  24/8,  set  the  divisor  (8)  on  the  minutes  scaleopposite the dividend (24) on the miles scale, and read the quotient (3) on the miles scale opposite theindex on the minutes scale (Figure 4.22).Figure 4.21. Multiplying Two Numbers.Figure 4.22. Dividing One Number by Another.4.9.7.2. In the computations encountered in air navigation, as in the above examples, a mental estimatewill aid in placing the decimal point.Section 4C— Effect of Wind on Aircraft4.10.  Basics.  Any  vehicle  traveling  on  the  ground,  such  as  an  automobile,  moves  in  the  direction  inwhich it is steered or headed and is affected very little by wind. However, an aircraft seldom travels inexactly the direction in which it is headed because of the wind effect.4.10.1. Any free object in the air moves downwind with the speed of the wind. This is just as true of anaircraft as it is of a balloon. If an aircraft is flying in a 20-knot wind, the body of air in which it is flyingmoves 20 NM in 1 hour. Therefore, the aircraft also moves 20 NM downwind in 1 hour. This movementis in addition to the forward movement of the aircraft through the body of air.128AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20014.10.2. The path of an aircraft over the earth is determined by the two unrelated factors shown in Figure4.23:  (1)  the  motion  of  the  aircraft  through  the  airmass,  and  (2)  the  motion  of  the  airmass  across  theearth's surface. The motion of the aircraft through the airmass is directly forward in response to the pullof the propellers or thrust of the jet engines, and its rate of movement through the airmass is TAS. Thismotion takes place in the direction of true heading (TH). This motion of the airmass across the earth'ssurface may be from any direction and at any speed. The measurement of its movement is called windand is expressed in direction and speed (wind vector [W/V]).Figure 4.23. Two Factors Determine Path of Aircraft.4.11. Drift Caused by Wind. The effect of wind on the aircraft is to cause it to follow a different pathover the ground than it does through the airmass. The path over the ground is its track. The terms truecourse (TC) and track are often considered synonymous. TC represents the intended path of the aircraftover the earth's surface. Track is the actual path that the aircraft has flown over the earth's surface. TC isconsidered to be future, while track is considered to be past.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011294.11.1.  The  lateral  displacement  of  the  aircraft  caused  by  the  wind  is  called  drift.  Drift  is  the  anglebetween the TH and the track. As shown in Figure 4.24 the aircraft has drifted to the right; this is knownas right drift.4.11.2. With a given wind, the drift will change on each heading. A change of heading will also affectthe  distance  flown  over  the  earth's  surface  in  a  given  time.  This  rate  traveled  relative  to  the  earth'ssurface is known as GS. Therefore, with a given wind, the GS varies on different headings.4.11.3. Figure 4.25 shows the effect of a 270o/20 knots wind on the GS and track of an aircraft flying onheadings of 000o, 090o, 180o, and 270o. The aircraft flies on each heading from point X for 1 hour at aconstant TAS.4.11.4. Note that on a TH of 000o, the wind causes right drift; whereas on a TH of 180o, the same windcauses left drift. On the headings of 090o and 270o, there is no drift at all. Note further that on a headingof 090o the aircraft is aided by a tailwind and travels farther in 1 hour than it would without a wind; thus,its GS is increased by the wind. On the heading of 270o, the headwind cuts down on the GS and alsocuts down the distance traveled. On the headings of 000o and 180o, the GS is unchanged.Figure 4.24. In 1 Hour, Aircraft Drifts Downwind an Amount Equal to Windspeed.130AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 4.25. Effects of Wind on Aircraft Flying in Opposite Directions.4.12. Drift Correction Compensates for Wind. In Figure 4.26, suppose the navigator wants to fly frompoint A to point B, on a TC of 000o, when the wind is 270o/20 knots. If the navigator flew a TH of 000o,the aircraft would not end up at point B but at some point downwind from B.4.12.1.  By  heading  the  aircraft  upwind  to  maintain  the  TC,  drift  will  be  compensated  for.  The  angleBAC  is  called  the  drift  correction  angle  or,  more  simply,  the  drift  correction.  Drift  correction  is  thecorrection which is applied to a TC to find the TH.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001131Figure 4.26. Aircraft Heads Upwind To Correct for Drift.4.12.2. Figure 4.27 shows the drift correction necessary in a 270o/20 knots wind if the aircraft is to makegood  a  TC  of  000o,  090o,  180o  or  270o.  When  drift  is  right,  correct  to  the  left,  and  the  sign  of  thecorrection is minus. When the drift is left, correct to the right, and the sign of the correction is plus.4.13. Vectors and Vector Diagrams. In aerial navigation, there are many problems to solve involvingspeeds and directions. These speeds and directions fit together in pairs: one speed with one direction.4.13.1. By using vector solution methods, unknown quantities can be found. For example, TH, TAS, andW/V  may  be  known,  and  track  and  GS  unknown.  To  solve  such  problems,  the  relationships  of  thesequantities must be understood.4.13.2. The vector can be represented on paper by a straight line. The direction of this line would be itsangle measured clockwise from true north (TN), while the magnitude or speed is the length of the linecompared to some arbitrary scale. An arrowhead is drawn on the line representing a vector to avoid anymisunderstanding of its direction. This line drawn on paper to represent a vector is known as a vectordiagram, or often it is referred to simply as a vector as shown in Figure 4.28. Future references to theword vector will mean its graphic representation.132AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 4.27. Maintaining Course in Wind.4.13.3. Two or more vectors can be added together simply by placing the tail of each succeeding vectorat the head of the previous vector. These vectors added together are known as component vectors.4.13.4. The sum of the component vectors can be determined by connecting, with a straight line, the tailof one vector to the head of the other. This sum is known as the resultant vector. By its construction, theresultant  vector  forms  a  closed  figure  as  shown  in  Figure  4.29.  Notice  the  resultant  is  the  same,regardless of the order, as long as the tail of one vector is connected to the head of another.4.13.5. The points to remember about vectors are as follows:4.13.5.1. A vector possesses both direction and magnitude. In aerial navigation, these are referred to asdirection and speed.4.13.5.2. When the components are represented tail to head in any order, a line connecting the tail of thefirst and the head of the last represents the resultant.4.13.5.3. All component vectors must be drawn to the same scale.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001133Figure 4.28. A Vector Has Both Magnitude and Direction.Figure 4.29. Resultant Vector Is Sum of Component Vectors.4.14. Wind Triangle and Its Solution:4.14.1. Vector Diagrams and Wind Triangles. A vector illustration showing the effect of the wind onthe  flight  of  an  aircraft  is  called  a  wind  triangle.  Draw  a  line  to  show  the  direction  and  speed  of  theaircraft through airmass (TH and TAS); this vector is called the air vector. Using the same scale, connectthe tail of the wind vector to the head of the air vector. Draw a line to show the direction and speed ofthe wind (W/V); this is the wind vector. A line connecting the tail of the air vector with the head of thewind  vector  is  the  resultant  of  these  two  component  vectors;  it  shows  the  direction  and  speed  of  theaircraft over the earth (track and GS). It is called the ground vector.4.14.1.1.  To  distinguish  one  from  another,  it  is  necessary  to  mark  each  vector.  Accomplish  this  byplacing one arrowhead at midpoint on the air vector pointing in the direction of TH. The ground vector134AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001has  two  arrowheads  at  midpoint  in  the  direction  of  track.  The  wind  vector  is  labeled  with  threearrowheads in the direction the wind is blowing. The completed wind triangle is shown in Figure 4.30.Figure 4.30. Mark Each Vector of Wind Triangle.4.14.1.2.  Remember  that  wind  direction  (WD)  and  windspeed  (WS)  compose  the  wind  vector.  Trueairspeed (TAS) and true heading (TH) form the air vector and GS and track compose the ground vector.4.14.1.3. The ground vector is the resultant of the other two; hence, the air vector and the wind vectorare always drawn head to tail. An easy way to remember this is that the wind always blows the aircraftfrom TH to track.4.14.1.4. Consider just what the wind triangle shows. In Figure 4.31, the aircraft departs from point A onthe TH of 360o at a TAS of 150 knots. In 1 hour, if there is no wind, it reaches point B at a distance of150 NM.4.14.1.5. In actuality, the wind is blowing from 270o at 30 knots. At the end of 1 hour, the aircraft is atpoint C 30 NM downwind. Therefore, the length BC represents the speed of the wind drawn to the samescale as the TAS. The length of BC represents the wind and is the wind vector.4.14.1.6. Line AC shows the distance and direction the aircraft travels over the ground in 1 hour. Thelength of AC represents the GS drawn to the same scale as the TAS and windspeed. Thus, the line AC,which is the resultant of AB and BC, represents the motion of the  aircraft over the  ground and is theground vector.4.14.1.7. Measuring the length of AC determines that the GS is 153 knots. Measuring the drift angle,BAC, and applying it to the TH of 360o, results in the track of 011o.4.14.1.8. If two vectors in a wind triangle are known, the third one can be found by drawing a diagramand  measuring  the  parts.  Actually,  the  wind  triangle  includes  six  quantities;  three  speeds  and  threedirections.  Problems  involving  these  six  quantities  make  up  a  large  part  of  DR  navigation.  If  four  ofthese quantities are known, the other two can be found. This is called solving the wind triangle and is animportant part of navigation.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 4.31. Wind Triangle.1354.14.1.9. The wind triangle may be solved by trigonometric tables; however, this is unnecessary sincethe  accuracy  of  this  method  far  exceeds  the  accuracy  of  the  data  available  and  the  results  needed.  Inflight, the wind triangle is solved graphically, either on the chart or on the vector or  wind face of thecomputer.4.14.1.10. The two graphic solutions of the wind triangle (chart solution and computer solution) perhapsappear dissimilar at first glance. However, they work on exactly the same principles. Plotting the windtriangle on paper has been discussed; now, the same triangle is plotted on the wind face of the computer.4.14.2. Wind Triangles on DR Computer. The wind face of the computer has three parts: (1) a frame,(2) a transparent circular plate which rotates in the frame, and (3) a slide or card which can be moved upand down in the frame under the circular plate. This portion of the computer is illustrated in Figure 4.32.4.14.2.1. The frame has a reference mark called the TRUE INDEX. A drift scale is graduated 45o to theleft  and  45o  to  the  right  of  the  true  index;  to  the  left  this  is  marked  DRIFT  LEFT,  and  to  the  right,DRIFT RIGHT.136AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 4.32. Wind Face of DR Computer.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011374.14.2.2.  The  circular  plate  has  around  its  edge  a  compass  rose  graduated  in  units  of  1  degree.  Theposition of the plate may be read on the compass rose opposite the true index. Except for the edge, thecircular plate is transparent so that the slide can be seen through it. Pencil marks can be made on thetransparent  surface.  The  centerline  is  cut  at  intervals  of  two  units  by  arcs  of  concentric  circles  calledspeed circles; these are numbered at intervals of 10 units.4.14.2.3. On each side of the centerline are track lines, which radiate from a point of origin off the slideas shown in Figure 4.33. Thus, the 14o track line on each side of the centerline makes an angle of 14owith  the  centerline  at  the  origin.  And  the  point  where  the  14o  track  line  intersects  the  speed  circlemarked 160 is 160 units from the origin.Figure 4.33. Speed Circles and Track Lines.138AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20014.14.2.4. In solving a wind triangle on the computer, plot part of the triangle on the transparent surfaceof the circular plate. For the other parts of the triangle, use the lines that are already drawn on the slide.Actually, there isn't room for the whole triangle on the computer, for the origin of the centerline is onevertex of the triangle. When learning to use the wind face of the computer, it may help to draw in asmuch as possible of each triangle.4.14.2.5. The centerline from its origin to the grommet always represents the air vector.  If the TAS is150k, move the slide so that 150 is under the grommet; then the length of the vector from the origin tothe grommet is 150 units as illustrated in A of Figure 4.34.4.14.2.6. The ground vector is represented by one of the track lines, with its tail at the origin and its headat the appropriate speed circle. If the track is 15o to the right of the TH, and the GS is 180 knots, use thetrack line 15o to the right of the centerline and consider the intersection of this line with the 180 speedcircle as the head of the vector as illustrated in B of Figure 4.34.4.14.2.7. The tail of the wind vector is at the grommet and its head is at the head of the ground vector asshown in C of Figure 4.34.4.14.2.8. Thus far, nothing has been said about the direction of the vectors. Since the true index is overthe centerline beyond the head of the air vector, this vector always points toward the index. Therefore,TH is read on the compass rose opposite the true index.4.14.2.9. Since track is TH with the drift angle applied, the value of track can be found on the scale ofthe circular plate opposite the drift correction on the drift scale. The wind vector is drawn with its tail atthe  grommet  as  shown  in  Figure  4.35.  Since  WD  is  the  direction  from  which  the  wind  blows,  it  isindicated  on  the  compass  rose  by  the  rearward  extension  of  the  wind  vector.  Therefore,  the  mostconvenient way to draw the wind vector is to set WD under the true index and draw the vector down thecenterline from the grommet; the scale on the centerline can then be used to determine the length of thevector.4.14.2.10.  Conversely,  to  read  a  wind  already  determined,  place  the  head  of  the  wind  vector  on  thecenterline below the grommet and read WD below the true index.4.14.3.  Wind  Triangle  Problems.  Depending  on  which  of  the  six  quantities  of  the  wind  triangle  areknown and which are unknown, there are three principal types of problems to solve. They are to solvefor (1) the ground vector, (2) the wind vector, and (3) TH and GS. The following discussion gives thesteps for the computer solution for each type. Work each sample problem and notice that the same windtriangle is shown on the computer that is shown on the chart, even though it is not completely drawn onthe computer.4.14.3.1.

Plotting a Wind Triangle on Computer.4.14.3.2. This type of problem arises when TH and TAS are known by reading the flight instruments andwhen the WD and velocity are known from either the metro forecast or from calculations in flight.4.14.3.3. Study Figure 4.36 and determine what has happened. By flying a TH of 100o at a TAS of 210knots in a wind of 020o/25 knots, the aircraft has actually moved over the ground along a track of 107o ata GS of 208 knots.140AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 4.35.

The  graphicsolution is now displayed on the computer as illustrated in Figure 4.37. The ground vector lies along oneof the radiating track lines with its head at the head of the wind vector.Figure 4.37. Solving for Track and Groundspeed Using Computer.4.14.3.4.5. Read GS (208 knots) on the speed circle which passes through the head of the ground vector.4.14.3.4.6. Read the drift angle (7o right) by counting the number of degrees from the centerline to theground vector; that is, to the head of the wind vector.4.14.3.4.7. Determine track (107o) by applying the drift angle to the TH. If the track is right of the centerline,  it  is  greater  than  the  TH;  so  the  drift  angle  must  be  added  to  the  TH.  An  alternate  method  ofdetermining  track  on  the  computer  is  to  read  the  drift  angle  at  the  head  of  the  ground  vector,  thentransform  this  value  to  the  drift  scale  on  the  same  side  of  the  true  index  and  read  the  track  on  thecompass rose of the circular disk.142AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20014.14.3.5.

They are the slip-and-slidemethod and the juggle method. Both will be discussed; however, the slip-and-slide method is normallypreferred.4.14.6.1. Slip-and-Slide Method (Figure 4.41):4.14.6.1.1.

Set the TC (230o) under the true index.4.14.6.1.4. Set end of wind vector on the TAS (220 knots) by moving the slide.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001145Figure 4.41.

The wind triangle is set up incorrectly,for TC rather than TH is set under the true index. However, since the TH is not known, the TC is used asa first approximation of the TH. This will give a  first  approximation  of  the  drift  angle,  which  can  beapplied to the TC to get a more accurate idea of the TH.4.14.6.2.5.  Determine  the  drift  angle  (10o  left)  on  the  approximate  heading  (230o)  to  obtain  a  secondapproximation of the TH (240o). If the drift angle is right, the drift correction is minus; if it is left, thedrift correction is plus.4.14.6.2.6. Set the second approximate heading (240o) under the true index. Read the drift angle for thisheading (8o left). To correct the wind triangle, the drift angle which is read at the head of the wind vectormust equal the difference between the TC and the TH which is set under the true index. As it stands, thedrift angle is 8o left, while the difference between TC and the indicated TH is 10o left.4.14.6.2.7. Juggle the compass rose until the drift angle equals the difference between TC and TH.  Inthis example, the correct drift angle is 8o left. Now the wind triangle is set up correctly.4.14.6.2.8. Read the TH (238o) under the true index.4.14.6.2.9. Read the GS (179 knots) on the speed circle passing through the head of the wind vector.4.15. Average Wind Affecting Aircraft. An average wind is an imaginary wind which would producethe same wind effect during a given period as two or more actual winds which affect the aircraft duringthat period. Sometimes an average wind can be applied once instead of applying each individual windseparately.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011474.15.1.  Authentically  Averaging  WDs.  If  the  wind  directions  (WD)  are  fairly  close  together,  asatisfactory  average  wind  can  be  determined  by  arithmetically  averaging  the  WDs  and  windspeeds.However, the greater the variation in WD, the less accurate the result will be. It is generally acceptedthat winds should not be averaged arithmetically if the difference in directions exceeds 090o and/or thespeed of less than 15 knots. In this case, there are other methods which may be used to obtain a moreaccurate average wind. A chart solution is shown in Figure 4.43.4.15.2.  Computer  Solution.  Winds  can  be  averaged  by  vectoring  them  on  the  wind  face  of  the  DRcomputer,  using  the  square  grid  portion  of  the  slide  and  the  rotatable  compass  rose.  Average  thefollowing three winds by this method: 030o/l5 knots, 080o/20 knots and 150o/35 knots:4.15.2.1. Place the slide in the computer so that the top line of the square grid portion is directly underthe grommet and the compass rose is oriented so that the direction of the first wind (030o) is under thetrue index. The speed of the wind (15 knots) is drawn down from the grommet (A of Figure 4.44).Figure 4.43. Solving for Average Wind Using Chart.4.15.2.2. Turn the compass rose until the direction of the second wind (080o) is under the true index andthen reposition the slide so that the head of the first wind vector is resting on the top line of the squaregrid section of the slide. Draw the speed of the second wind (20 knots) straight down (parallel to thevertical grid lines) from the head of the first wind arrow (B of Figure 4.44).4.15.2.3. Turn the compass rose so that the direction of the third wind (150o) is under the true index andreposition the slide so that the head of the second wind vector is resting on the top line of the square gridsection of this slide. Draw the speed of the third  wind  (35  knots)  straight  down  from  the  head  of  thesecond wind arrow (C of Figure 4.44).148AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 4.44. Solving for Average Wind Using Computer.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011494.15.2.4. Turn the compass rose so the head of the third wind arrow is on centerline below the grommet.Reposition  the  slide  to  place  the  grommet  on  the  top  line  of  the  square  grid  section.  The  resultant  oraverage  wind  direction  is  read  directly  beneath  the  true  index  (108o).  Measuring  the  length  of  theresultant wind vector (46) on the square grid section and divide it by the number of winds used (3) todetermine the windspeed. This will give a WS of about 15½ knots. The average wind then is 108o/15 1/2knots (D of Figure 4.44).4.15.2.5. With a large number of winds to be averaged or high windspeeds, it may not possible to drawall the wind vectors on the computer unless the windspeeds are cut by 1/2 or 1/3. If one windspeed iscut, all windspeeds must be cut. In determining the resultant windspeed, the length of the total vectormust be multiplied by 2 or 3, depending on how the windspeed was cut, and then divided by the totalnumber of winds used. In cutting the speeds, the direction is not affected and the WD is read under thetrue index.4.15.2.6. Wind effect is proportional to time (Figure 4.45). To sum up two or more winds which haveaffected the aircraft for different lengths of time, weigh them in proportion to the times. If one wind hasacted twice as long as another, its vector should be drawn in twice as shown. In determining the averagewindspeed, this wind must be counted twice.Figure 4.45. Weigh Winds in Proportion to Time.4.16.  Resolution  of  Rectangular  Coordinates.  Data  for  radar  equipment  is  often  given  in  terms  ofrectangular  coordinates;  therefore,  it  is  important  that  the  navigator  be  familiar  with  the  handling  ofthese coordinates. The DR computer provides a ready and easy method of interconversion.4.16.1. Given: A wind of 340o/25 knots to be converted to rectangular coordinates (Figure 4.46).4.16.1.1.

Basics.  Good  dead  reckoning  (DR)  techniques  can  result  in  fairly  accurate  positions.  But,  evenwhen employing the very best techniques, the DR position will become less accurate as time increasesbeyond  the  last  known  position.  Small  errors  tend  to  accumulate  into  one  total  error  which  isunacceptable. To minimize this error, the navigator must be able to establish an accurate position fromwhich to restart DR. This accurate position is free of any DR errors and is called a fix. A fix is simply apoint from which the navigator  can restart DR, just as if it were the takeoff point. We will begin ourdiscussion of fixing with an explanation of lines of position (LOP).5.2. LOP Explained. It is possible to solve part of the fix problem without knowing your exact location.For example, assume you are in a strange town and you call a friend to meet you downtown. If you tellthis  person  that  you  are  somewhere  on  Park  Street,  your  friend  can  limit  any  search  for  you  to  thatparticular street. In this case, Park Street is an LOP. An LOP is a series of possible positions or fixes. Itcan be a straight line (such as a city street) or a curved line (such as a river), but it gives a definite clueto your position.5.2.1. If you tell your friend that you are at Park Street where it crosses the Karuzas River, it would thenestablish  your  exact  location.  You  have  used  two  LOPs  to  determine  your  exact  position.  Thus,  twointersecting LOPs identify a point which establishes a fix.5.2.2.  You  can  use  the  same  procedure  as  a  navigator.  You  may  be  flying  along  a  railroad  that  youidentify as the Jedicke Railroad on your chart. As you continue on this course, you notice the railroadcrosses a river that is labeled the King River on your chart. When you fly over the point where these twovisual LOPs cross, you know your exact location over the ground and on your chart. You now have a fixfrom which you can continue to DR.5.3.  Types  of  LOPs.  A  fix  gives  definite  information  as  to  both  track  and  groundspeed  (GS)  of  anaircraft since the last fix, but a single LOP can only define either the track or the GS--not both. And itmay not clearly define either. The evidence obtained from an LOP depends upon the angle at which itintersects the track. LOPs are sometimes classified according to this angle.5.3.1.  Course  Line.  An  LOP  which  is  parallel  or  nearly  parallel  to  the  course  is  called  a  course  line(Figure 5.1). It gives information as to possible locations of the aircraft laterally in relation to the course;that is, whether it is to the right or left of course.  Because it does  not  indicate  how  far  the  aircraft  isalong the track, no speed information is provided.5.3.2.  Speed  Line.  An  LOP  which  is  perpendicular,  or  nearly  so,  to  the  track  is  called  a  speed  line(Figure 5.2) because it indicates how far the aircraft has traveled along the track and, thus, is a measureof GS. It does not indicate whether the aircraft is to the right or left of the course.152AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 5.1. Line of Position Parallel to Track Is Course Line.Figure 5.2. Line of Position Perpendicular to Track Is Speed Line.5.3.3. LOPs by Bearings. One method of determining an LOP is to establish the direction of the line ofsight  (LOS)  to  a  known  fixed  object.  The  direction  of  the  LOS  is  the  bearing  of  the  object  from  theaircraft.  A  line  plotted  in  the  direction  of  the  bearing  is  an  LOP.  At  the  time  of  the  observation,  theaircraft was on the LOP.5.3.4. Relative Bearings (RB). An RB is the angle between the fore-and-aft axis of the aircraft and theLOS  to  the  object,  always  measured  clockwise  from  000o  at  the  nose  of  the  aircraft  through  360o.  InFigure 5.3, the RB of the object is shown as 070o. You must convert this to a true bearing (TB) beforeyou can plot it. To do this, you simply add the RB to the true heading (TH) the aircraft was flying whenyou obtained the bearing. (Subtract 360o if the total exceeds this amount.) Thus:RB + TH = TB (RuB THe TuB)Where:RB is the relative bearing,TH is the true heading, andTB is the true bearing.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001153Assuming the aircraft was on a TH of 210o when the bearing was taken, the corresponding TB of theobject is 280o. (070o RB + 210o TH = 280o  TB)Figure 5.3. True Bearing Equals Relative Bearing Plus True Heading.5.4.  Plotting  the  LOP.  As  previously  stated,  two  intersecting  LOPs  determine  the  position  of  theaircraft. The only other possible point from which to begin plotting the LOP is the object on which youtook the bearing. The procedure is to use the reciprocal of the TB of the object, thus drawing an LOPtoward the aircraft. In actual practice, it is not necessary to compute the reciprocal of the bearing; the TBis measured with the plotter, and the LOP is drawn toward the opposite end of the plotter. To establishan LOP by RB, the navigator must know (1) the position of the source (object) of the bearing, (2) the THof the aircraft, (3) the RB of the object, and (4) the exact time at which the TH and RBs were taken.Section 5B— Fixes5.5. Adjusting LOPs for a Fix. Sometimes it is impossible for a navigator to obtain more than one LOPat  a  given  time.  If  two  LOPs  are  for  two  different  times,  their  intersection  does  not  constitute  a  fixbecause  the  aircraft  moved  between  the  time  it  was  on  the  first  LOP  and  the  second  LOP.  Theillustration  in  Figure  5.4  shows  a  bearing  taken  at  1055Z  and  another  at  1100Z.  At  1055Z  when  thenavigator took the first bearing, the aircraft was somewhere along the 1055Z LOP (single-barbed LOP)and, at 1100Z, it was somewhere along the 1100Z LOP. The intersection of these two lines, as plotted,does not constitute a fix. For an intersection to become a fix, the navigator must either obtain the LOPsat  the  same  time  or  adjust  them  to  a  common  time  by  using  the  motion  of  the  aircraft  between  theobservations. The usual method of adjusting an LOP for the motion of the aircraft is to advance one lineto the time of the other. The illustration in Figure 5.4 shows how this is done. The desired time of the fixis 1100Z.5.5.1. Determine the time to advance the 1055Z LOP (5 minutes). Multiply this time by the aircraft GS(300 knots).5.5.2. Measure the distance computed in the first step in the direction of the track of the aircraft (045o).154AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 5.4. Adjusting Lines of Position for Fix.5.5.3. Draw a line through this point parallel to the 1055Z LOP (double-barbed LOP). This representsthe advanced LOP. The intersection of the advanced LOP and the 1100Z LOP is the fix. The advancedLOP is usually plotted on the chart with two arrowheads, while the unadvanced LOP is marked with asingle arrowhead.5.5.4. When three LOPs are involved, the procedure is exactly the same as for two. The resolution ofthree LOPs, however, may result in a triangle instead of a point, and the triangle may be large enough tovary the position of the fix. The technique many navigators use is to place the fix at the center of thetriangle.  The  illustration  in  Figure  5.5  shows  a  technique  for  finding  the  center  of  the  triangle  bybisecting the angles of the triangle. The point of intersection of the bisectors is equal distance from allthree LOPs and is the fix position.Figure 5.5. Bisector Method.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011555.6. The Running Fix. It is possible to establish an aircraft position by a series of bearings on the sameobject. For best accuracy, these RBs are taken when the object is approximately 45o, 90o, and 135o fromthe aircraft. The navigator then advances or retards the LOPs to a common time. The result is a runningfix. The accuracy is based on the aircrafts distance from object and the amount of time it takes to  gofrom the first bearing to the last bearing since you must move two of the LOPs for the aircrafts track andGS. The running fix is illustrated in Figure 5.6.Figure 5.6. The Running Fix.5.7. Accuracy of a Fix. The accuracy of a fix can sometimes be improved by the use of a little foresight.If the track of the aircraft is known more accurately than the GS, the course line should be adjusted sinceany error in the GS will have little effect on it. If, however, you desire to adjust a speed line under theseconditions, the accuracy of the fix is in doubt. Similarly, if the GS is known more accurately than thetrack, the speed line should be adjusted to the time of the course line. The line which will be affectedleast by the information in doubt is the line which should be adjusted.Section 5C— Radio Aids5.8. Basics. Radio aids are ground based navigation facilities that transmit electronic signals received byairborne units. Radio aids can be used for departure, en route navigation or arrivals, and procedures forobtaining and plotting a fix vary by category. Explanations of different types of radio aids and how tofix with them follow.5.9. Nondirectional Radio Beacon (NDB). This is a low, medium, or ultra high frequency (UHF) radiobeacon which transmits nondirectional signals whereby the user can determine a bearing and home tothe station. NDBs normally operate in the frequency band of 190 to 535 kilocycles (kHz) and transmit acontinuous carrier with either 400 or 1020 cycles per second (Hz) modulation. All radio beacons, except156AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001the  compass  locators,  transmit  a  continuous  three-letter  identification  code  except  during  voicetransmissions.5.9.1. Disturbance. They are subject to disturbances that may result in erroneous bearing information.Such  disturbances  result  from  intermittent  or  unpredictable  signal  propagation  due  to  such  factors  aslightning,  precipitation,  static,  etc.  At  night,  radio  beacons  are  vulnerable  to  interference  from  distantstations. Nearly all disturbances that affect the automatic direction finder (ADF) bearing also affect thefacility's  identification.  Noisy  identification  usually  occurs  when  the  ADF  needle  is  erratic.  Voice,music, or erroneous identification will usually be heard when a steady false bearing is being displayed.Since ADF receivers do not have a flag to warn the user when erroneous bearing information is beingdisplayed, the NDB's identification should be continuously monitored.5.9.2. Control Panels. There are several different types of control panels currently installed in Air Forceaircraft. Refer to aircraft technical manuals for specific guidance pertaining to equipment operation.5.10. Plotting on a Chart. Before an ADF bearing can be plotted on a navigation chart, two things mustbe done. First, the bearing obtained must be converted to a true bearing (TB). If a nonrotatable compasscard is used, the resultant RB may be converted to TB by adding the aircraft true heading (TH) (TH +RB = TB). If a rotatable compass card is used, the TB can be found by applying the magnetic variationat the vicinity of the aircraft.5.11. Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Direction Finders (DF). Some aircraft are equipped with ADFs inthe UHF frequency range (225.0–399.9 mHz) which utilize loop and sensing (antennas) to give bearinginformation. Operation of the DF is controlled from the UHF radio panel. It is used to obtain bearing toother aircraft and to emergency locator beacons.5.12.  VHF  Omnidirectional  Range  (VOR).  VOR  stations  operate  between  108.00  and  117.95megacycles per second (mHz). VHF communications operate between 118.00 and 135.90 mHz. Stationidentifiers  for  VOR  NAVAIDs  are  given  in  code  or  voice,  or  by  alternating  code  and  voicetransmissions.  VOR  transmissions  are  limited  by  line  of  sight  (LOS)  and  a  combination  of  aircraftaltitude and distance to the station. Accurate information may be obtained from 40 to 100 NM aroundthe  facility,  although  the  usable  range  may  be  much  greater  (300  NM).  VOR  may  be  used  by  flyingcourses from one station to another as part of the high or low jet navigation airways system. It may beused  as  a  fixing  aid  by  taking  a  bearing  and  applying  magnetic  variation  at  the  station  (convertingmagnetic bearing [MB] to TB) and plotting an LOP. In aircraft equipped with two VORs, the bearings totwo different stations may be taken simultaneously and plotted, and a fix position obtained. The aircraftis directly overflying a VOR when the bearing pointer drops rapidly below the 3 or 9 o'clock position.5.12.1. Control Panel. A VOR control panel contains (1)  a power switch, (2)  frequency window,  (3)volume control, (4) equipment self-test capability, and (5) frequency selector controls. All are shown inFigure 5.7. To tune a VOR, turn power switch to PWR, select desired frequency and identify the station.For positive test indications, consult applicable aircraft technical order.5.12.2.  Indicator  Panel.  Several  types  of  indicators  exist  which  display  VOR  information.  Examplesshown here are the course indicator (Figure 5.8), the radio magnetic indicator (RMI) in Figure 5.9, andthe bearing direction heading indicator (BDHI) in Figure 5.10. The course indicator has eight significantfeatures: (1) TO-FROM indicator, (2) glide slope and course warning flags, (3) course selector window,AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001157(4)  marker  beacon  light,  (5)  glide  slope  indicator,  (6)  heading  pointer,  (7)  course  deviation  indicator(CDI), and (8)course set knob.Figure 5.7. VOR Nav Control Panel.Figure 5.8. Course Indicator.158AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 5.9. Radio Magnetic Indicator.Figure 5.10. Bearing Distance Heading Indicator.5.12.3. Indicators. The TO-FROM indicator shows whether the radial set in the course selector windowis to or from the station, and the CDI represents this radial. If the aircraft is to the right of the radial, theCDI is displaced to the left of center on the course indicator. The glide slope indicator is similar to theCDI but represents the glide slope transmitted by an instrument landing system (ILS). If the glide slopeindicator is below the center of the course indicator, the aircraft is above the glide slope. The glide slopeand course warning flags inform the user that either the glide slope indicator or CDI is inoperative, orthat signals received are too weak to be used. The heading pointer indicates the difference, left or right,between  the  aircraft  MH  and  the  radial  set  in  the  course  selection  window.  The  marker  beacon  lightAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001159flashes when passing over a marker beacon (such as, outer marker of the ILS). The RMI is a bearingindicator,  usually  with  two  pointers  and  a  movable  compass  rose.  The  compass  rose  rotates  as  theaircraft  turns,  indicating  the  compass  heading  of  the  aircraft  under  the  top  of  the  index  at  all  times.Therefore, all bearings taken from an RMI are magnetic. Consult the specific technical order as to whichpointer is the VOR.5.12.4.  BDHI.  The  BDHI  is  similar  to  the  RMI  because  the  needles  provides  MB  information.Additional information concerning the BDHI is in the TACAN section.5.13.  Tactical  Air  Navigation  (TACAN).  The  TACAN  system  was  developed  to  provide  thecrewmember with information needed for precise positioning within 200 NM. As with VOR, TACANprovides  an  infinite  number  of  radials  radiating  outwardly  from  the  station.  In  addition,  distancemeasuring  equipment  (DME),  an  integral  part  of  TACAN,  provides  continuous  slant-range  distanceinformation.  TACAN  operates  in  the  UHF  band  and  has  126  channels  available  in  the  X-band  pulsecode.  Development  of  pulse  coding  has  given  ground  equipment  the  capability  of  an  additional  126channels in the Y-band. The station identifier is transmitted at 35-second intervals in international Morsecode. Airborne DME transmits on 1025-1150 mHz; associated ground-to-air frequencies are in the 962-1024 mHz and 1151-1213 mHz ranges. Channels are separated at 1 mHz intervals in these bands.5.13.1. Ground Equipment. The ground equipment consists of a rotating-type antenna for transmittingbearing  information  and  a  receiver-transmitter  (transponder)  for  transmitting  distance  information.Permanent ground stations are dual transmitter-equipped (one operating and one in standby) installationswhich  automatically  switch  to  the  standby  transmitter  when  a  malfunction  occurs.  Each  station  has  aground monitor which is set to alarm at a radial shift of 1o from the alignment to magnetic north (MN).This  alarm  is  usually  located  in  the  base  control  tower  or  approach  control,  and  sets  off  a  light  andbuzzer to warn when an out-of-tolerance condition exists. It is possible to select a TACAN station andget  erroneous  DME  and  azimuth  lock-on  when  the  station  is  undergoing  maintenance.  This  can  bedetected  by  an  absence  of  signal  identifier.  Checks  of  en  route  or  radio  NAVAIDs  may  be  made  byconsulting NOTAMs prior to flight or by contacting air traffic control for advisories when airborne.5.13.2. Airborne Equipment. The airborne equipment also contains a multichannel transmitter-receiver(transceiver). Bearing information is automatically obtained with the correct channel selected. Distanceis  determined  by  measuring  the  elapsed  time  between  transmission  of  interrogating  pulses  of  theairborne  set  and  reception  of  corresponding  reply  pulses  from  the  ground  stations.  This  sequence  isinitiated  by  the  aircraft  transmitter  and  requires  about  12  microseconds  per  NM  round  trip.  Since  theDME  gives  a  readout  of  slant  range  rather  than  ground  range,  a  correction  has  to  be  applied  to  thereading. (See slant range table for correction.)5.13.2.1.  DME  is  designed  to  provide  reliable  information  to  a  maximum  distance  of  199  NM,dependent on aircraft equipment and LOS. Accuracy is plus or minus one half NM or 3 percent of thedistance, whichever is greater.5.13.2.2. Since a large number of aircraft could be interrogating the same station, the aircraft TACANmust sort out the pulses which are replies to its own signal. Interrogation pulses are transmitted on anirregular and random basis by the airborne set which then searches for replies synchronized to its owninterrogations. If the signals are interrupted, a memory circuit maintains the last distance indications onthe range indicator for approximately 10 seconds to prevent the search operation from recurring. Thisprocess starts automatically when a new station is tuned or when there is a major interruption of signals.160AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Depending  upon  the  actual  distance  from  the  station,  the  searching  process  may  require  up  to  22seconds. The maximum number of aircraft which can be accommodated by one station at any one timeis 100. With the development of the X and Y bands, this number can be doubled.5.14. TACAN Characteristics:5.14.1.  Bearing  and/or  Distance  Unlock.  Since  TACAN  bearing  and  DME  are  subject  to  LOSrestrictions,  this  information  could  be  lost  any  time  signals  are  blocked.  Temporary  obstructions  canoccur  in  flight  any  time  any  part  of  the  aircraft  gets  between  the  ground  and  aircraft  antenna.  Otheraircraft, terrain, and buildings are external causes for unlock. Any time the signal is obstructed for morethan  10  seconds  for  DME  and  2  seconds  for  azimuth,  the  unlock  conditions  will  be  indicated  by  arotating bearing needle and a tumbling DME readout.5.14.2. Azimuth Cone of Confusion. TACAN antennas transmit radio energy in circular patterns outfrom the transmitter. However,  waves  are not transmitted directly above the station. Therefore,  as theaircraft approaches a TACAN station, signals are lost. This is indicated by a rotating TACAN bearingneedle in the RMI. The azimuth cone can be up to 100o or more in width or approximately 15 NM wideat 40,000 feet. Thus, one may enter the cone of confusion at approximately 7.5 DME  at this altitude.Approaching  the  station,  usable  TACAN  information  is  lost  before  the  cone  is  reached  as  aircraftmemory circuits maintain the last information.5.14.3. Range Indicator Fluctuations. Slight oscillations up to approximately one forth NM are normalfor range indicator operation due to the pulses  generated by  the  transmit  or  receive  function.  When  ausable signal is lost, the memory circuit maintains the indicated range for about 10 seconds, after whichunlock will occur unless usable signals are regained.5.14.4.  Forty  Degree  Azimuth  Error  Lock-on.  The  construction  of  the  TACAN  ground  antenna  issuch  that  it  transmits  a  series  of  nine  signal  lobes  (eight  auxiliary  and  one  main  reference  pulse)  40oapart. With the airborne receiver working correctly, these pulses lock on the airborne equipment with themain reference at 090o. With a weak signal, the main reference pulse may slide over or miss the 090oslot and lock on at one of the auxiliary positions. When this occurs, azimuth indications will be 40o or amultiple  of  40o  in  error.  Forty  degrees  azimuth  lock-on  error  will  not  cause  a  course  warning  flag  toappear on the indicator. Rechanneling the airborne receiver may give the set another chance to lock onproperly.5.14.5. Co-Channel Interference. Co-channel interference occurs when  an aircraft is in a position toreceive  TACAN  signals  from  more  than  one  ground  station  on  the  same  frequency.  This  normallyoccurs  only  at  high  altitudes  when  distance  separation  between  like  frequencies  is  inadequate.  DME,azimuth,  or  identification  from  either  station  may  be  received.  This  is  not  a  malfunction  of  eitherairborne or ground equipment, but a result of position.5.14.6. Air-to-Air (A/A) TACAN. This function is provided to give distance information between twoaircraft, working in the same manner as a regular ground-based TACAN station. Some sets provide onlyDME information. Newer sets provide both distance and bearing information to other aircraft. In orderto  obtain  useful  information,  the  A/A  function  should  be  selected  by  both  aircraft  with  a  63-channelfrequency separation.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011615.14.6.1. In addition, each aircraft must have the same frequency band (X or Y) selected. Therefore, ifone aircraft sets A/A Channel 4 and the other sets A/A Channel 67 in the X  band  useful  informationshould be obtained.5.14.6.2. A/A TACAN is primarily used during the rendezvous portions of air refueling operations orformation  flights.  A  prescribed  turn  range  (DME)  and  offset  (bearing,  if  available)  between  the  twoaircraft are used to effect the rendezvous. Proper A/A channels for each air refueling route are found inthe FLIP Planning Document.5.14.7. Tuning and Controls. The basic controls of most TACAN systems are shown in Figure 5.11.The proper channel is tuned by rotating channel selector knobs (1) to any of 126 channels. Knob (2), theinternal test mode, validates working condition of TACAN. The channel mode selector (4) allows X orY band to be selected. These controls are presented in the channel indicator (3). A volume control (5)adjusts  the  audio  level  of  the  station  identifier  signal.  The  TACAN  test  button  permits  the  user  toperform a system self-test. The function selector (6) has four settings:Figure 5.11. TACAN Control Panel.5.14.7.1. OFF—Removes power to the set.5.14.7.2. REC—Energizes the receiver to obtain bearing information.5.14.7.3. T/R—Energizes both receiver and transmitter to obtain both bearing and distance information.5.14.7.4.  A/A—Transmits  and  receives  interrogations  and  replies  to  measure  range  to  another  A/ATACAN-equipped aircraft. Bearing information is not provided on this set.162AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20015.14.8. VORTAC. In order to provide both military and civilian pilots the capability of positioning fromthe  same  radio  NAVAIDs,  a  combination  of  VOR  and  TACAN  station  was  developed.  Each  facilityoffers three services. VOR azimuth signals are transmitted on the published VOR frequency. TACANazimuth and DME signals are broadcast on the published UHF channel.5.15. Fix-to-Fix Navigation (Using RMI and BDHI). Flying from one radial and DME to another isbasic  to  many  departures  and  approaches.  A  heading  to  the  desired  point  may  be  derived  quicklythrough  the  use  of  an  RMI,  providing  a  radial  and  a  separate  readout  of  DME.  The  same  proceduresapply for a BDHI. The following technique and example are provided in order to demonstrate how tocompute a heading. Refer to Figure 5.12.EXAMPLE:Present Position 180o/60Desired Position 090o/30Present Heading 000oFigure 5.12. Fix-to-Fix Solution.5.15.1. Tune, identify, and monitor correct VOR and TACAN.5.15.2. Turn the aircraft in the general direction of the desired fix by turning to a heading approximatelyhalfway between the head of the bearing pointer (000o) and the radial on which the desired fix is located(090o). In this case, turn to 045o.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011635.15.3. Visualize your aircraft position and the desired fix on the RMI as follows:5.15.3.1.  The  center  of  the  RMI  is  considered  to  be  the  VOR  or  TACAN,  and  the  compass  rosesimulates the radials around the station.5.15.3.2. The fix with the greater range (180o/60) is established at the outer edge of the compass card.5.15.3.3. The fix with the lesser range  (090o/30) is established  at a  point  which  is  proportional  to  thedistance represented by the outer edge of the compass card.5.15.4. Determine the heading to the desired fix by connecting your present position to your desired fixwith an imaginary line on the RMI (B to C). Establish another imaginary line parallel to the line labeledB to C through the center of the RMI. This line will indicate your no-wind heading to your desired fix(030o).5.15.5. Turn to 030o and apply any drift correction. With 5o right drift, we would turn to 025o.5.15.6. Cross-check your position continually and correct as necessary.5.16. Fix-to-Fix Navigation (Using the MB-4 Computer). A  fix-to-fix can also be computed on thewind face side of an MB-4 computer. First, give the pilot a general heading toward the fix. (NOTE: Youcan  work  in  bearings;  however,  all  work  must  be  done  in  either  bearings  or  radials  to  compute  thesolution.) For the following example, radials will be used. The fix you wish to navigate to is the 280oradial at 30 DME. Set up a graphic depiction on the wind face side of your computer with your presentposition (350o radial at 050 DME) and the desired fix (280o/030). Use the following steps:5.16.1. Place your present position (350o/050) on the wind face side using the square grid at the bottomof the MB-4. Align 350o on the compass rose under the true index. Mark the point by counting down 50NM from the true airspeed (TAS) grommet and mark with a +. Use the scale set up on the square grid orset up an applicable scale. The scale used must remain constant throughout the problem (Figure 5.13).5.16.2.  Place  the  fix  radial  and  DME  (280o/030)  on  the  computer  the  same  way  you  did  in  step  one(Figure 5.14). Mark as a fix symbol (Δ).5.16.3. Determine the no wind heading by rotating the compass rose so that the present position (+) isdirectly above the fix (Δ). Use the square grid at the bottom to help with alignment (Figure 5.15). Turnthe aircraft to MC under the true index (206o for this example) and kill the drift. (NOTE: You can placeyour present position (+) on the 0 NM horizontal baseline then, using your NM increment scale, countdown to the fix position (Δ) to determine how far you are from the fix (48 NM in this example; Figure5.15.)5.16.4. Repeat the procedure as necessary to keep your progress updated.164AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 5.13. Setting Present Position on MB-4 Computer.Figure 5.14. Setting Fix on MB-4 Computer.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001165Figure 5.15. Solution to Fix-to-Fix and Distance to Fix.Section 5D— Communication5.17.  Long  and  Short  Range  Communication.  Air-to-ground  communications  can  be  achievedthrough the use of many types of radio equipment. High frequency bands (HF, VHF, UHF) are relativelystatic-free  and  are  less  susceptible  to  outside  interference  than  lower  frequencies.  It  must  beremembered, however, that the  higher  the  frequency,  the  more  nearly  the  transmission  will  follow  anLOS path. As frequency increases, therefore, communication range decreases.5.17.1. Long Range:5.17.1.1. Systems used for long-range radio communications between aircraft and ground stations maybe  either  amplitude  modulation  (AM)  or  single  sideband  (SSB)  transmissions.  Single  sidebandtransmitters  concentrate  all  available  power  into  one  sideband;  therefore,  SSB  is  much  more  efficientand has greater range than an AM transmitter of the same power.5.17.1.2. Although HF  ground waves attenuate rapidly, sky waves at these frequencies are capable  oftransmitting  at  distances  up  to  12,000  miles  or  more,  depending  on  ionospheric  conditions.  HFequipment is used mostly in remote areas where VHF or UHF communication is not possible because ofthe great distance which must be spanned.5.17.2.  Short  Range  Air-to-Air  and  Air-to-Ground.  Short  range  air-to-air  and  air-to-groundcommunications are confined to the VHF and UHF bands. VHF channels are spaced at 25 kHz intervalsfrom 116 to 151.975 mHz, and UHF channels are spaced at 50 kHz intervals from 225.0 to 399.9 mHz.Most UHF and HF transceivers have a manual frequency selection capability in addition to a number ofpreset channels. Transmission and reception are accomplished with a single antenna.166AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20015.17.3. AN/APX-64 Transponder. The AN/APX-64 (Figure 5.16) provides for Mark X IdentificationFriend  or  Foe  (IFF)  with  selective  identification  feature  (SIF)  in  normal  operating  modes.  Twoadditional  modes  allow  more  specific  identification  by  controlling  agencies.  Mode  C  works  inconjunction with the aircraft altitude computer and gives automatic altitude reporting to ground radar.Mode  4  provides  a  secure  IFF  capability  for  military  aircraft.  A  typical  IFF  set  has  the  followingfeatures:Figure 5.16. IFF/SIF Transponder.5.17.3.1.  IFF  Master  Control  Knob.  This  is  a  five-position  detented  rotary  switch:  (1)  OFF,  (2)STBY—No  transmission  capability.

IFF  Mode  Switches.  Four  three-position  toggle  switches  are  used  to  select  the  desiredoperating modes. Mode 1 is the aircraft security identity mode. Mode 2 is for unit identity. Mode 3/A isfor  normal  air  traffic  control  identity.  Mode  C  is  the  altitude  reporting  mode.  The  three  positions  areidentical for all four toggle switches:  (1)  OUT—Mode  disabled,  (2)  ON—Allows  normal  response  tomode  interrogations,  and  (3)  TEST—Spring-loaded  for  in-flight  test  of  selected  mode.

Identification  Friend  or  Foe  (IFF)  and  Selective  Identification  Feature  (SIF).  IFF  is  anairborne transponder that transmits coded signals when interrogated by ground-based search radar whichwas first used during World War II. Pulses received from the airborne equipment produce blips on theground-based radarscope and are used to positively identify and locate aircraft. The addition of an SIFallows faster isolation and identification  of  any  aircraft  under  surveillance.  The  ground  controller  canestablish  and  maintain  positive  identification  when  a  designated  SIF  mode  and  code  is  set  into  theairborne transponder. Initial identification is usually established by using the IP or indent function of theairborne set. Tracking is maintained by setting the requested mode and code into the aircraft equipment.168AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Chapter 6MAP READINGSection 6A— Introduction6.1.  Basics.  Map  reading  is  the  determination  of  aircraft  position  by  matching  natural  or  built-upfeatures with their corresponding symbols on a chart. It is one of the more basic aids to dead reckoning(DR) and certainly the earliest used form of aerospace navigation. The degree of success in map readingdepends  upon  a  navigator's  proficiency  in  chart  interpretation,  ability  to  estimate  distance,  and  theavailability of landmarks.Figure 6.1. Landmarks as Checkpoints, Populated Areas.6.2. Checkpoints. Checkpoints are landmarks or geographic coordinates used to fix the position of theaircraft. By  comparing the  aircraft  position  to  that  of  the  checkpoint,  the  navigator  fixes  the  aircraft'slocation.  Arrival  over  checkpoints  at  planned  times  is  a  confirmation  of  the  wind  prediction  andindicates  reliability  of  the  predicted  track  and  groundspeed.  If  the  aircraft  passes  near  but  not  over  acheckpoint, the anticipated track was not made good. If checkpoints are crossed but not at the predictedtime,  the  anticipated  GS  was  in  error.  Prudent  navigators  are  quick  to  observe  and  evaluate  thedifference  between  an  anticipated  position  and  an  actual  position.  They  must  make  corrections  tomaintain  their  intended  course  as  soon  as  possible  because  small  errors  can  be  cumulative  and  mayeventually result in the aircrew becoming lost. It is also important to closely monitor time control. Onmany map reading missions, the aircraft is required to pass over certain checkpoints at exact times. Onthese missions, navigators must adjust the airspeed to make good their anticipated GS.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011696.2.1.  Before  fixing  each  position,  navigators  should  look  for  several  related  details  around  eachcheckpoint to make sure it has been positively identified. For example, if the checkpoint is a small town,there may be a lake to the north, a road intersection to the south, and a bridge to the east.6.2.2. Generally, it is better to select a feature on the chart and then seek it on the ground rather than towork from the ground to the chart. The chart does not show all the detail which is on the ground, andone could easily become confused. Checkpoints should be features or groups of features that stand outfrom  the  background  and  are  easily  identifiable.  In  open  areas,  any  town  or  road  intersection  can  beused; however, these same features in densely populated areas are difficult to distinguish. Figures 6.1and  6.2  compare  various  chart  and  corresponding  photo  areas  and  list  the  features  to  look  for  whenidentifying landmarks as checkpoints.Figure 6.2. Landmarks as Checkpoints, Coastal Areas.6.3. Chart Selection. Use a chart for map reading that provides sufficient natural and built-up featuresto  accurately  position  the  aircraft.  The  Operational  Navigation  Chart  (ONC),  with  a  scale  of1:1,000,000, has excellent cultural and  relief  portrayal.  For  increased  detail,  a  Tactical  Pilotage  Chart(TPC), with a scale of 1:500,000, or a Joint Operations Graphics (JOG) Chart with a scale of 1:250,000,may be used. To extract minute details or precise coordinates, use a topographic line map (TLM) serieschart, typically at a scale of 1:50,000.Section 6B— Map Reading Procedures6.4.  Basics.  When  inflight,  orient  the  chart  so  that  north  on  the  chart  is  toward  true  north  (TN).  Thecourse line on the chart will then be aligned with the intended course of the aircraft so that landmarks onthe  ground  appear  in  the  same  relative  position  as  the  features  on  the  chart.  Obtain  the  approximateposition of the aircraft by DR. Select an identifiable landmark on the chart at or near the DR position. Itis important to work from the chart to the ground. Identify the landmark selected and fix the position ofthe aircraft. The importance of a good DR cannot be over emphasized. When there is any uncertainty ofposition, every possible detail should be checked before identifying a checkpoint. The relative positionsof  roads,  railroads,  airfields,  and  bridges  make  good  checkpoints.  Intersections  and  bends  in  roads,railroads, and rivers are equally good. When a landmark is a large feature, such as a major metropolitanarea, select a small prominent checkpoint within the large landmark to fix the position of the aircraft.170AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001When  a  landmark  is  not  available  as  a  reference  at  a  scheduled  turning  point,  make  the  turn  on  theestimated time of arrival (ETA). Extend the DR position to the next landmark and fix the position of theaircraft to make sure the desired course and GS are being maintained. Remember, the desired magneticcourse on any given leg corrected for drift is the magnetic heading which will parallel course. This willhelp to keep from getting any farther off course.6.5.  Low-Level  Map  Reading.  On  low-level  flights,  you  may  encounter  additional  difficulties.Turbulence  increases  the  difficulty  of  reading  instruments.  Depending  on  the  aircraft's  altitude  aboveground level (AGL), the circle of visibility can be greatly reduced, and those objects that are visible passby so rapidly only the largest landmarks can be easily identified.6.5.1. In low-level navigation, flight planning is especially important as there is little time for in flightcomputations.  An  important  part  of  good  mission  planning  is  proper  chart  preparation.  The  mostcommonly used chart for low-level day operations is the JOG chart and at night a TPC. Normally radius-of-turn procedures are used when drawing the chart, but depending on your tactics point to point is alsoan option. Time elapsed marks and distance remaining marks along the course line of each leg will givenavigators a running DR with the aid of a stopwatch.6.5.2. In low-level flight, one should be particularly alert to possible danger from obstructions. Hills andmountains are easily avoided if the visibility is good. Radio and television towers, which may extend asmuch  as  1,000  feet  or  more  into  the  air,  often  from  elevated  ground,  are  less  conspicuous.  All  suchobstructions may or may not be shown on the  aeronautical charts. Keep  your charts updated with  thelocation of new obstructions by using the Chart Updating Manual (CHUM). The CHUM lists importantchanges to all current navigation charts, but does not contain manmade obstacles less than 200 feet tall.The CHUM is published twice a year with supplements published monthly. Electronic updates are alsoavailable.6.6. Map Reading at Night. At night, unlighted landmarks may be difficult or impossible to see. Lightscan  be  confusing  because  they  appear  closer  than  they  really  are.  Fixing  on  points  other  than  thosedirectly beneath the aircraft is very difficult. Objects may be more easily seen by scanning or looking atthem indirectly to eliminate the eye's visual blindspot. Preserve your night vision by working with red orgreen light, being aware that red light can detract from the chart color. Moonlight makes it possible tosee prominent landmarks like land-water contrast. Reflected moonlight often  causes  a river or lake  tostand out brightly for a moment, but this condition is usually too brief for  accurate  fixing. Roads andrailroads may be seen after the eyes are accustomed to the darkness. Lighted landmarks, such as citiesand towns, stand out more clearly at night than in daytime. Large cities can often be recognized by theirdistinctive  shapes.  Many  small  towns  are  dark  at  night  and  are  not  visible  to  the  unaided  eye.  Nightvision  goggles  dramatically  enhance  map  reading  in  dark  areas.  Some  airfields  have  distinctive  lightpatterns and may be used as checkpoints. Military fields use a double white and single  green  rotatingbeacon,  while  civilian  fields  use  a  single  white  and  single  green  rotating  beacon.  Busy  highways  arediscernible because of automobile headlights.6.7. Estimating Distance. A landmark often falls right or left of course and the navigator must estimatethe  distance  to  it.  While  the  ability  to  estimate  distance  from  a  landmark  rests  largely  in  skill  andexperience, the  following  methods  may  be  of  assistance.  One  method  is  to  compare  the  distance  to  alandmark with the distance between two other points as measured on the chart. Another method, shownin Figure 6.3, is to estimate the angle between the aircraft subpoint and the line of sight. The distance inNM from the landmark to the subpoint of the aircraft depends on the sighting angle:AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 6.3. Estimating Distances.1716.7.1. (60o) horizontal distance = absolute altitude of aircraft X 1.7.6.7.2. (45o) horizontal distance = absolute altitude of aircraft.6.7.3. (30o) horizontal distance = absolute altitude of aircraft X .6.6.8.  Seasonal  Changes.  Seasonal  changes  can  conceal  landmarks  or  change  their  appearance.  Smalllakes and rivers may dry up during the summer. Their outlines may change considerably during the wetseason. Snow can cover up almost all of the normally used landmarks. When flying in the winter, it isoften  necessary  to  rely  on  more  prominent  checkpoints,  such  as  river  bends,  hills,  or  larger  towns.However, due to the size of these checkpoints, course control can be somewhat degraded.6.9. Map Reading in High Latitudes. Map reading in high latitudes is considerably more difficult thanmap  reading  in  the  lower  latitudes.  The  nature  of  the  terrain  is  drastically  different,  charts  are  lessdetailed and less precise, seasonal changes may alter the terrain appearance or hide it completely fromview, and there are fewer cultural features.6.9.1. In high latitudes, navigators find few distinguishable features from which to determine a position.Built-up features are practically nonexistent. The few which do exist are closely grouped, offering littlehelp to the navigator flying long navigation legs. Natural features which do exist are in limited varietyand  are  difficult  to  distinguish  from  each  other.  Lakes  seem  endless  in  number  and  identical  inappearance. The countless inlets are extremely difficult to identify, particularly in winter. What appears172AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001to be land may in reality be floating ice, the shape of which can change from day to day. Recognizable,reliable checkpoints are few and far between.6.9.2. Map reading in high latitudes is further complicated by inadequate charting. Some polar areas areyet to be thoroughly surveyed. The charts portray the appearance of general locales, but many individualterrain features are merely approximated or omitted entirely. In place of detailed outlines of lakes, forexample, charts often carry the brief annotation—many lakes. Fixing is possible, but requires extendedeffort and keen judgment on your part.6.9.3.  When  snow  blankets  the  terrain  from  horizon  to  horizon,  navigation  by  map  reading  becomesacutely difficult. Coastal ice becomes indistinguishable from the land, coastal contours appear radicallychanged, and many inlets, streams, and lakes disappear. Blowing snow may extend to heights of 200 to300  feet  and  may  continue  for  several  days,  but  visibility  is  usually  excellent  in  the  absence  ofinterfering clouds or ice crystal haze. However, when snow obliterates surface  features and the sky iscovered with a uniform layer of clouds so that no shadows are cast, the horizon disappears, causing earthand sky to blend together. This forms an unbroken expanse of white called whiteout. In this completelack  of  contrast,  distance  and  height  above  ground  are  virtually  impossible  to  estimate.  Whiteout  isparticularly prevalent in northern Alaska during late winter and spring. The continuous darkness of nightpresents another hazard; nevertheless, surface features are often visible because the snow is an excellentreflector of light from the moon, the stars, and the aurora.6.10. Contour Map Reading. Use of contours is the most common method of showing relief featureson a chart. Contours are lines that, at certain intervals, connect points of equal elevation. To understandcontours better, think of the zero contour line to be sea level.  If the sea  were to rise 10 feet, the newshoreline would be the 10-foot contour line. Similarly, successive 10-foot contour lines could be easilydetermined. Contour lines are closer together where the slope is steep and farther apart where the slopeis gentle. Within the limits of the contour intervals, the height of points and the angle of slope can alsobe determined from the chart. Refer to Figure 1.32 for an illustration of the use of contour lines.6.10.1. Contour intervals are determined by the scale of the chart, the amount of relief, and the accuracyof the survey. These intervals may range from 1 foot on a large-scale chart through 2,000 feet or greateron a smaller scale chart. Contours may be annotated in feet or meters. Contours may be shown on chartsin varying colors and are frequently labeled with figures of elevation. To further accentuate the terrain, agradient system of coloring is also employed. The lighter colors are used to show lower areas while agradual increase in density (darkness) is used to portray the higher terrain.6.10.2.  Military  operations  require  the  analysis  of  contour-labeled  charts  to  visualize  the  land.  Inoperational planning, this is of the utmost importance, whether it is planning a route for a safe flight orin determining the best escape from enemy territory.6.11.  Summary.  Map  reading  is  a  critical  skill  for  navigators  in  many  aircraft,  but  it  takes  time  tobecome  proficient.  Keep  a  good  DR,  work  from  chart  to  ground,  and  remember  the  effect  varyingconditions have on what you see outside your window.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001173Chapter 7RADAR NAVIGATIONSection 7A— Radar Principles7.1. Introduction. In the hands of the skilled operator, radar provides precise updates to dead reckoning(DR)  for  navigation  and  airborne  delivery  operators.  At  cruising  altitudes,  it  provides  information  onland and water characteristics as well as hazardous weather conditions over hundreds of miles aroundthe  aircraft.  At  low-level,  it  provides  detailed  terrain  information  used  to  navigate  at  high  speed  overchanging courses. It is adapted to terrain-avoidance and terrain-following equipment. Radar is a sourceof  track  and  drift  angle  (DA)  information  for  wind  computations  and  can  be  used  with  beacons  forintercept, rendezvous, airdrop, and bombing operations.7.1.1. The basis of the system has been known theoretically since the time of Heinrich Hertz who, in1888, successfully demonstrated the transfer of electromagnetic energy in space and showed that suchenergy  is  capable  of  reflection.  The  transmission  of  electromagnetic  energy  between  two  points  wasdeveloped as radio, but it was not until 1922 that practical use of the reflection properties of such energywas conceived. The idea of measuring the elapsed time between the transmission of a radio signal andreceipt  of  its  reflected  echo  from  a  surface  originated  nearly  simultaneously  in  the  United  States  andEngland.  In  the  United  States,  two  scientists  working  with  air-to-ground  signals  noticed  that  shipsmoving in the nearby Potomac River distorted the pattern of these signals. In 1925, the same scientistswere  able  to  measure  the  time  required  for  a  short  burst,  or  pulse,  of  radio  energy  to  travel  to  theionosphere and return. Following this success, it was realized the radar principle could be applied to thedetection of other objects, including ships and aircraft.7.1.2. By the beginning of World War II, the Army and Navy had developed equipment appropriate totheir respective fields. During and following the war, the rapid advance in theory and technological skillbrought improvements and additional applications of the early equipment. It is now possible to measureaccurately the distance and direction of a reflecting surface in space, whether it is an aircraft, a ship, ahurricane, or a prominent feature of the terrain, even under conditions of darkness or restricted visibility.For these reasons, radar has become a valuable navigational tool.7.1.3. As noted previously, the fundamental principle of radar may be likened to that of relating sound toits echo. Thus, a ship sometimes determines its distance from a cliff at the water's edge by blowing itswhistle and timing the interval until the echo is received. The same principle applies to radar, which usesthe  reflected  echo  of  electromagnetic  radiation  traveling  at  the  speed  of  light.  This  speed  isapproximately 162,000  NM  per  second;  it  may  also  be  expressed  as  985  feet  per  microsecond.  If  theinterval between the transmission of the signal and return of the echo is 200 microseconds, the distanceto the target is:Section 7B— Radar Set Components7.2. Overview. The principle of radar is accomplished by developing a pulse of microwave energy thatis transmitted from the aircraft and is reflected by objects in its path. The reflected pulse is amplified and174AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001converted by the receiver for display on the cathode-ray  tube  (CRT). The timing unit or synchronizersynchronizes all the actions in the set. To this basic unit, improvements are added for special purposes,such as weather avoidance, filtering, and terrain following.7.3. Components:7.3.1. The receiver and transmitter are usually one unit (the R/T) with separate functions that, for thisdescription, are dealt with separately (Figure 7.1).Figure 7.1. Radar System Components.7.3.2.  The  transmitter  produces  the  radio  frequency  (RF)  energy  using  magnetrons.  A  magnetrongenerates  radar  pulses  by  bunching  electrons  using  alternately  charged  grids  the  electrons  travel  past.The spurts of energy are of high power and short duration. The energy is released at intervals (the pulserecurrence rate) determined by the selected operating range.7.3.3. The generated pulse travels through either coaxial cable or, more frequently, a hollow tube calledthe  wave  guide.  The  wave  guide  requires  pressurization  to  ensure  the  maintenance  of  conditions  forproper microwave  conduction. The  energy passes an  electronic switching device that directs  outgoingpulses to the antenna and incoming pulses from the antenna to the receiver.7.3.4.  The  antenna  is  a  parabolic  dish  with  a  protruding  wave  guide.  It  is  gimbal-mounted  to  allowrotation of the dish and, in most cases, to allow stabilization of the dish relative to the earth's surfacewhen the aircraft turns. Rotation of the antenna could be through 360o or in a sector (either variable orpreset).  The  360o  rotation,  or  scan,  is  usually  for  mapping;  whereas,  a  sector  is  used  in  aircraft  withlimited space for the antenna or where the intent is to concentrate energy in a small area.7.3.5.  The  antenna  assembly  will  be  either  permanently  locked  to  the  longitudinal  axis  of  the  aircraft(boresighted)  or  only  so  aligned  when  stabilization  units  are  inactive.  When  not  caged,  the  antennastabilization  is  accomplished  by  using  gyroservo  mechanisms.  A  sensor  system  that  providesinformation to a computer keeps the antenna radiation plane parallel to the earth even when the aircraftis in a climb or a bank.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011757.3.5.1. There are two radiation patterns popular in airborne radar design, fan and pencil beams. The fanbeam is a wide pattern that distributes the RF energy  across the beam in proportion to the distance itmust travel (Figure 7.2). The fan beam is best for general mapping. To concentrate the energy emitted,the  pencil  beam  antenna  is  used.  The  pencil  beam  dish  allows  scanning  for  weather  or  aircraft  whileeliminating ground clutter. It can be used to put more energy on a section of ground to increase returns.Figure 7.2. Antenna Radiation Patterns.7.3.5.2. The antenna can be manipulated to aim the emissions through a control that tilts the dish fromthe horizontal plane. At cruising altitudes, in the mapping mode, it is sufficient to slightly tilt the dishdown, but tilt should be constantly adjusted for optimum returns.7.3.6. After transmission, the reflected energy is directed back to the wave guide where it travels past theswitching device which directs the returns to the receiver. The receiver converts the microwave returnsto electrical signals that are amplified and sent to a CRT called the planned position indicator (PPI). Theamplification  of  the  returns  is  controllable  through  a  gain  circuit.  Depending  on  the  type  of  returndesired on the PPI, the operator adjusts the receiver gain. Other booster circuits, such as sweep intensityor  video  gain,  are  available,  but  operation  of  the  receiver  is  most  important.  If  adequate  receiveramplification of weak returns is not applied, no amount of later stage adjustments will put the target onthe scope.7.3.7. The PPI, or scope, offers both range and azimuth information about targets to the operator. Thisinformation is relative to the aircraft's position which can be referenced at either the center of the scopeor offset to the side of the screen (Figure 7.3). The PPI is a CRT with focusing coils and a deflectioncoil. The deflection coil is an electromagnet whose variable field manipulates the electron beam so thatreturns can be presented on the scope in their correct position relative to the observer (Figure 7.4).7.3.8. Applying a polarization to the signals going to the CRT produces the actual presentation of thereturn.  The  null  return  has  a  predominantly  positive  charge;  therefore,  the  trace  is  suppressed.  Apolarization  shift  is  produced  in  the  current  to  produce  a  blooming  of  the  trace  corresponding  to  thestrength and position of the received signal.7.3.9. Range is determined by the travel time of a pulse from and back to the R/T unit. Knowing that RFenergy  travels  at  the  constant  speed  of  light,  range  determination  is  simple.  The  synchronizercoordinates its display on the PPI.176AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 7.3. Sector Scan Displays.Figure 7.4. Electromagnetic Cathode Ray Tube.7.3.10.  At  the  same  instant  that  the  timer  triggers  the  transmitter,  it  also  sends  a  trigger  signal  to  theindicator. Here, a circuit is actuated which causes the current in the deflection coils to rise at  a linear(uniform)  rate.  The  rising  current,  in  turn,  causes  the  spot  to  be  deflected  radially  outward  from  thecenter of the scope. The spot thus traces a faint line on the scope; this line is called the sweep. If no echois received, the intensity of the sweep remains uniform throughout its entire length. However, if an echois returned, it is so applied to the CRT that it intensifies the spot and momentarily brightens a segment ofthe sweep relative to the size of the target. Since the sweep is linear and begins with the emission of thetransmitted pulse, the point at which the echo brightens the sweep will be an indication of the range tothe object causing the echo.7.3.11. The progressive positions of the pulse in space also indicate the corresponding positions of theelectron beam as it sweeps across the face of the CRT. If the radius of the scope represents 40 miles andthe  return  appears  at  three-quarters  of  the  distance  from  the  center  of  the  scope  to  its  periphery,  thetarget is represented as being about 30 miles away.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011777.3.12. In the preceding example, the radar is set for 40-mile range operation. The sweep circuits willthus operate only for an equivalent time interval so that targets beyond 40 miles will not appear on thescope. The time equivalent to 40 miles of radar range is only 496 microseconds (496 X 10-6 seconds).Thus,  496  microseconds  after  a  pulse  is  transmitted  (plus  an  additional  period  of  perhaps  100microseconds to allow the sweep circuits to recover) the radar is ready to transmit the next pulse. Theactual pulse repetition rate in this example is about 800 pulses per second. The return will,  therefore,appear  in  virtually  the  same  position  along  the  sweep  as  each  successive  pulse  is  transmitted,  eventhough the aircraft and the target are moving at appreciable speeds.7.3.13. At times, the PPI will not display targets across the entire range selected on the scope. In thesecases, atmospheric refraction and the line of sight (LOS) characteristics of radar energy have affectedthe effective range of the set. The following formula can determine the radar's range in these situationswhere D is distance and h is the aircraft altitude:7.3.14. Azimuth measurement is achieved by synchronizing the deflection coil with the antenna. In thebasic radar unit, when the antenna is pointed directly off the nose of the aircraft, the deflection coils arealigned to fire the trace at the 12 o'clock position on the scope. As the antenna rotates, the deflection coilmoves at the same rate. Relative target presentations are displayed as the sweep  rotation  is  combinedwith the range display.Section 7C— Scope Interpretation7.4. Basics. The PPI presents a map-like picture of the terrain below and around the aircraft. Just as mapreading  skill  is  largely  dependent  upon  the  ability  to  correlate  what  is  seen  on  the  ground  with  thesymbols on the chart, so the art of scope presentation analysis is largely dependent upon the ability tocorrelate what is seen on the scope with the chart symbols. Application of the concept of radar reflectionand  an  understanding  of  how  received  signals  are  displayed  on  the  PPI  are  prerequisites  to  scopeinterpretation.  Furthermore,  knowledge  of  these  factors  applied  in  reverse  enables  the  navigator  topredict the probable radarscope appearance of any area.7.5.  Factors  Affecting  Reflection.  A  target's  ability  to  reflect  energy  is  based  on  the  target'scomposition, size, and the radar beam's angle of reflection (Figure 7.5). The range of the target from theaircraft is definitive in the quantity of returned energy. The range of a target produces an inverse effecton  the  target's  radar  cross-section.  And  there  will  be  some  atmospheric  attenuation  of  the  pulseproportional  to  the  distance  that  the  energy  must  travel.  Generally,  all  four  factors  contribute  to  thedisplayed  return.  A  single  factor  can,  in  some  cases,  either  prevent  a  target  from  reflecting  sufficientenergy for detection or cause a disproportionate excess of reflected energy to be received and displayed.The following are general rules of radarscope interpretation:7.5.1. The greatest return potential exists when the radar beam forms a horizontal right angle with thefrontal portion of the reflector.7.5.2.  Radar  return  potential  is  roughly  proportional  to  the  target  size  and  the  reflective  properties(density) of the target.178AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 7.5. Relative Reflectivity of Structural Materials.7.5.3. Radar return potential is greatest within the zone of the greatest radiation pattern of the antenna.7.5.4. Radar return potential decreases as altitude increases because the vertical reflection angle becomesmore and more removed from the optimum. (There are many exceptions to this general rule since thereare many structures that may present better reflection from roof surfaces than from frontal surfaces or inthe case of weather.)7.5.5.  Radar  return  potential  decreases  as  range  increases  because  of  the  greater  beam  width  at  longranges and because of atmospheric attenuation.NOTE: All of the factors affecting reflection must be considered to determine the radar return potential.7.6. Typical Radar Returns:7.6.1.  Returns  From  Land.  All  land  surfaces  present  minute  irregular  parts  of  the  total  surface  forreflection of the radar beam; thus, there is usually a certain amount of radar return from all land areas.The  amount  of  return  varies  considerably  according  to  the  nature  of  the  land  surface  scanned.  Thisvariance is caused by the difference in reflecting materials of which the land area is composed and thetexture of the land surface. These are the primary factors governing the total radar return from specificland areas.7.6.2. Flat Land. A certain amount of any surface, however flat in the overall view, is irregular enoughto reflect the radar beam. Surfaces which are apparently flat are actually textured and may cause returnson the scope. Ordinary soil absorbs some of the radar energy and, thus, the return that emanates fromthis type of surface is not strong. Irregularly textured land areas present more surface to the radar beamthan flat land and, thus, causes more return. The returns from irregularly textured land areas are mostintense  when  the  radar  beam  scans  the  ridges  or  similar  features  at  a  right  angle.  This  effect  isparticularly helpful in detecting riverbeds, gullies, or other sharp breaks in the surface height. At times,in desolate areas that  are  flat,  these  occasional  surface  changes  are  apparent  where  it  would  not  haveappeared  in  more  irregular  topography.  Such  returns  provide  recognizable  targets  in  otherwise  sparsecircumstances. In other cases, especially at low-level over broken terrain, this effect could complicatescope interpretation.7.6.3. Hills and Mountains. Hills and mountains will normally give more radar returns than flat landbecause the radar beam is more nearly perpendicular to the sides of these features. The typical return is abright return from the near side of the feature and an area of no return on the far side. The area of noreturn, called a mountain shadow, exists because the radar beam cannot penetrate the mountain and itsAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001179LOS transmission does not allow it to intercept targets behind the mountain (Figure 7.6). The shadowarea  will  vary  in  size,  depending  upon  the  height  of  the  aircraft  with  respect  to  the  mountain.  As  anaircraft approaches a mountain, the shadow area becomes smaller at higher altitudes. Furthermore, theshape  of  the  shadow  area  and  the  brightness  of  the  return  from  the  peak  will  vary  as  the  aircraft'sposition changes. As the aircraft closes on the mountainous area, shadows may disappear completely asthe  beam  covers  the  entire  surface  area.  At  this  point,  a  great  deal  of  energy  is  reflected  back  at  theantenna and recognizable features in that area will be rare.Figure 7.6. Mountain Shadows.7.6.3.1.  Recognition  of  mountain  shadow  is  important  because  any  target  in  the  area  behind  themountain cannot  be  seen  on  the  scope.  In  areas  with  isolated  high  peaks  or  mountain  ridges,  contournavigation may be possible because the returns from such features assume an almost three-dimensionalappearance. This allows specific peaks to be identified.7.6.3.2. In more rugged mountainous areas, however, there may be so many mountains with resultingreturn and shadow areas that contour navigation is almost impossible. But these mountainous areas arecomposed of patches of mountains or hills, each having different relative sizes and shapes and relativepositions from other patches. By observing these relationships on a chart, general aircraft positioning isfeasible.7.6.4.  Coastlines  and  Riverbanks.  The  contrast  between  water  and  land  is  very  sharp,  so  that  theconfiguration of coasts and lakes  are seen with map-like  clarity in most cases (Figure 7.7). When theradar beam scans the banks of a river, lake, or larger body of water, there is little or no return from thewater surface itself, but there is usually a return from the adjoining land. The more rugged the bank or180AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001coastline,  the  more  returns  will  be  experienced.  In  cases  where  there  are  wide,  smooth  mud  flats  orsandy beaches, the exact definition of the coastline will require careful tuning.Figure 7.7. Radar Returns.7.6.4.1. Since both mountains and lakes present a dark area on the scope, it is sometimes easy to mistakea mountain shadow for a lake. This is particularly true when navigating in mountainous areas that alsocontain lakes.7.6.4.2. One difference between returns from mountain areas and lakes is that returns from mountainsare  bright  on  the  near  side  and  dark  on  the  far  side,  while  returns  from  lakes  are  of  more  uniformbrightness  all  around  the  edges.  Another  characteristic  of  mountain  returns  is  that  the  no-show  areachanges  its  shape  and  position  quite  rapidly  as  the  aircraft  moves;  returns  from  lakes  changeinconsequentially.7.6.5. Cultural Returns. The overall size and shape of the radar return from any given city can usuallybe  determined  with  a  fair  degree  of  accuracy  by  referring  to  a  current  map  of  the  area  (Figure  7.7).However, the brightness of one cultural area as compared to another may vary greatly and this variancecan hardly be forecasted by reference to the navigation chart. In general, due to the collection of densematerials  therein,  urban  and  suburban  areas  generate  strong  returns,  although  the  industrial  andcommercial centers of the cities produce a much greater brightness than the outlying residential areas.Many isolated or small groups  of  structures  create  radar  returns.  The  size  and  brightness  of  the  radarreturns these features produce are dependent on their construction. If these structures are not plotted onthe  navigation  charts,  they  are  of  no  navigational  value.  However,  some  of  them  give  very  strongreturns, such as large concrete dams, steel bridges, etc.; and, if any are plotted on the chart and can beproperly identified, they can provide valuable navigational assistance.7.6.6. Weather Returns. Cloud returns that appear on the scope are of interest for two reasons. First,since the brightness of a given cloud return is an indication of the intensity of the weather within thecloud, intense weather areas can be avoided by directing the pilot through the areas of least intensity orAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001181by circumnavigating the entire cloud return (Figure 7.8). Second, cloud returns obscure useful naturaland cultural features on the ground. They may also be falsely identified as a ground feature, which canlead  to  gross  errors  in  radar  fixing.  Clouds  must  be  reasonably  large  to  create  a  return  on  the  scope.However,  size  alone  is  not  the  sole  determining  factor.  The  one  really  important  characteristic  thatcauses clouds to  create  radar  returns  is  the  size  of  the  water  droplets  forming  them.  Radar  waves  arereflected from  large  rain  droplets  and  hail  which  fall  through  the  atmosphere  or  are  suspended  in  theclouds by strong vertical air  currents. Thunderstorms are  characterized by strong  vertical  air  currents;therefore, they give very strong radar returns. Cloud returns may be identified as follows:Figure 7.8. Weather Returns.7.6.6.1.  Brightness  varies  considerably,  but  the  average  brightness  is  greater  than  a  normal  groundreturn.7.6.6.2. Returns generally present a hazy, fuzzy appearance around their edges.7.6.6.3. Returns often produce shadow areas similar to mountain shadows because the radar beam doesnot penetrate clouds completely.7.6.6.4. Returns do not fade away as the antenna tilt is raised, but ground returns do tend to decrease inintensity with an increase in antenna tilt.7.6.6.5. Returns can appear in the altitude hole when altitude delay is not used and the distance to thecloud is less than the altitude.7.6.7. Effects of Snow and Ice:7.6.7.1. The effects of snow and ice are similar to the effect of water.182AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20017.6.7.2. If a land area is covered to any great depth with snow: (1) some of the radar beam will reflectfrom the snow and (2) some of the energy will be absorbed by the snow. The overall effect is to reducethe return that would normally come from the snow-blanketed area.7.6.7.3. Ice will react in a slightly different manner, depending upon its roughness. If an ice coating on abody  of  water  remains  smooth,  the  return  will  appear  approximately  the  same  as  a  water  return.However,  if  the  ice  is  formed  in  irregular  patterns,  the  returns  created  will  be  comparable  to  terrainfeatures  of  commensurate  size.  For  example,  ice  ridges  or  ice  mountains  would  create  returnscomparable to ground embankments or mountains, respectively. Also, offshore ice floes tend to disguisethe true shape of a coastline so that the coastline may appear vastly different in winter as compared tosummer. This phenomenon is termed arctic reversal because the resultant PPI display will often be theopposite of the anticipated display.7.7. Inherent Scope Errors. Another factor which must be  considered in  radarscope  interpretation  isthe  inherent  distortion  of  the  radar  display.  This  distortion  is  present  to  a  greater  or  lesser  degree  inevery radar set, depending upon its design. Inherent scope errors may be attributed to three causes: widthof beam, the length (time duration) of the transmitted pulse, and the diameter of the electron spot.7.7.1. Beam-Width Error. Beam-width error is not overly significant in radar navigation (although itmust be taken into account in radar bombing). Since the distortion is essentially symmetrical, it may benullified  by  bisecting  the  return  with  the  bearing  cursor  when  a  bearing  is  measured.  Reducing  thereceiver gain control also lessens beam-width distortion.7.7.2. Pulse-Length Error. Pulse-length error is  caused  by  the  fact  that  the  radar  transmission  is  notinstantaneous but lasts for a brief period of time. There is a distortion in the range depiction on the farside of the reflector and this pulse-length error is equal to the range equivalent of one-half of the pulsetime.  Since  pulse  length  error  occurs  on  the  far  side  of  the  return,  it  may  be  nullified  by  reading  therange to, and plotting from, the near side of a reflecting target when taking radar ranges.7.7.3. Spot-Size Error. Spot-size error is caused by the fact that the electron beam which displays thereturns  on  the  scope  has  a  definite  physical  diameter.  No  return  which  appears  on  the  scope  can  besmaller than the diameter of the beam. Furthermore, a part of the glow produced when the electron beamstrikes the phosphorescent coating of the CRT radiates laterally  across the scope. As  a result of thesetwo factors, all returns displayed on the scope will appear to be slightly larger in size than they actuallyare. Spot-size distortion may be reduced by using the lowest practicable receiver gain, video gain, andbias settings and by keeping the operating range at a minimum so that the area represented by each spotis kept at a minimum. Further, the operator should check the focus control for optimum setting.7.7.4. Total Distortion. For navigational purposes, these errors are often negligible. However, the radarnavigator should realize that they do exist and that optimum radar accuracy demands that they be takeninto account. They are usually most significant when the target is a thin, no-show (river), when it is veryreflective but small, or when it is in close proximity to another show target. Thin no-shows are erasedexcept for their wider points. With tiny but very reflective targets, the cross-section of the return wouldnormally be negligible on the PPI. Their extremely strong reflectance, coupled with the inherent errors,causes them to appear larger and of seemingly more significance on the indicator. When show targetsare  close  to  each  other,  these  errors  will  cause  them  to  blend  together,  thus,  diminishing  the  scoperesolution. Generally, the combined effects of the inherent errors cause reflecting targets to appear largerand nonreflecting targets to dwindle (Figure 7.9).AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001183Figure 7.9. Combined Effects of Inherent Errors.Section 7D— Radar Enhancements7.8.  Basics.  The  airborne  radar  sets  used  throughout  the  Air  Force  vary  slightly  in  the  navigationalrefinements offered. The following is a description of enhancements designed to overcome some of thecommon problems encountered in radar navigation.7.9.  Variable  Range  Marker  and  Crosshairs.  Most  radar  sets  provide  a  range  marker  that  may  bemoved  within  certain  limits  by  the  radar  operator.  This  variable  range  marker  permits  more  accuratemeasurement of range because the marker can be positioned more accurately on the scope. Furthermore,visual interpolation of range is simplified when using the variable range marker. On many radar sets, anelectronic  azimuth  marker  has  been  added  to  the  variable  range  marker  to  facilitate  fixing.  Theintersection of the azimuth marker and the variable range marker is defined as radar crosshairs.7.10. Altitude Delay. It is obvious that the ground directly beneath the aircraft is the closest reflectingobject. Therefore, the first return that can appear on the scope will be from this ground point. Since ittakes some finite period of time for the radar pulses to travel to the ground and back, it follows that thesweep must travel some finite distance radially from the center of the scope before it displays the firstreturn. Consequently, a hole will appear in the center of the scope within which no ground returns canappear. Since the size of this hole is proportional to altitude, its radius can be used to estimate altitude. Ifthe radius of the altitude hole is 12,000 feet, the absolute altitude of the aircraft is about 12,000 feet.7.10.1. Although the altitude hole may  be  used  to  estimate  altitude,  it  occupies  a  large  portion  of  thescope face, especially when the aircraft is flying at a high altitude and using a short range. This may beseen  in  Figure  7.10.  In  this  particular  case,  the  range  selector  switch  is  set  for  a  50/10-mile  rangepresentation.  Without  altitude  delay,  the  return  shown  on  the  inside  part  of  the  scope  consists  of  thealtitude hole and the return shown on the remaining part is a badly distorted presentation of all of theterrain below the aircraft.7.10.2. Many radar sets incorporate an altitude delay circuit which permits the removal of the altitudehole. This is accomplished by delaying the start of the sweep until the radar pulse has had time to travelto  the  ground  point  directly  below  the  aircraft  and  back.  Hence,  the  name  altitude  delay  circuit.  Thealtitude  delay  circuit  also  minimizes  distortion  and  makes  it  possible  for  the  radarscope  to  present  aground picture which preserves the actual relationships between the various ground objects.184AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 7.10. Altitude Delay Eliminates the Hole.7.11. Sweep Delay. Sweep delay is a feature which delays the start of the sweep until after the radarpulse has had time to travel some distance into space. In this respect, it is very similar to altitude delay.The  use  of  sweep  delay  enables  the  radar  operator  to  obtain  an  enlarged  view  of  areas  at  extendedranges. For example, two targets that are 75 miles from the aircraft can only be displayed on the scope ifa range scale  greater than 75 miles is being used. On the 100-mile range scale, the two targets mightappear very small and close together. By introducing 50 miles of sweep delay, the display of the twotargets will be enlarged (Figure 7.11). The more this range is reduced, the greater will be the enlargingeffect. On some sets, the range displayed during sweep delay operation is fixed by the design of the setand cannot be adjusted by the operator.Figure 7.11. Sweep Delay Provides Telescopic View.7.12.  Iso-Echo.  Detecting  hazardous  weather  is  not  difficult  in  the  normal  mapping  mode  with  mostradar units. The weather mode offers increased sensitivity to weather phenomenon. But to discriminatebetween areas of varying hazards presents a dilemma. Reflected energy from weather is dependent onthe density of the rain and hail it contains. The limitations of PPI capabilities to display these dynamicAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001185characteristics  make  detection  of  the  more  intense  areas  difficult.  Also,  computer  circuitry  is  moreeffective at judging slight variations in shading than the human eye.7.12.1.  The  iso-echo  control  compensates  for  this  deficiency  by  presenting  a  void  area  on  the  PPIcorresponding  to  a  hazardous  area  in  the  weather  environment.  This  void  area,  the  black  hole,  isdependent on a control that the operator sets to define the intensity of the area that is to be avoided. Forinstance, say only the largest cells of weather are desired to be displayed. The operator would set theappropriate  control  and,  on  the  PPI,  the  weather  depiction  would  be  present.  The  areas  within  theweather where the most hazardous cells were located would be no-show areas or black holes.7.12.2. The iso-echo circuits are capable of sensing the variation in the received signals and act like aradio squelch control to block presentation of selected intensities (Figure 7.12). A word of caution! Iso-echo is not selective in the targets it will block. If ground returns are received by the radar and a portionof their intensity falls into the range selected to be blocked, they too will be blocked from the scope.Figure 7.12. Iso-Echo.7.13. Radar Beacon. Radar beacons have been used for many years in air-to-ground operations. In thepast, airfields had beacons visible on radar much like a nondirectional beacon (NDB) but most are nowdecommissioned.  Aircraft  IFF-SIF  transponders  are  the  outgrowth  of  this  earlier  equipment.  Radarbeacons are still used in air-to-air operations by Air Mobility and Air Combat Commands for types ofrendezvous.7.13.1. Radar beacons consist of interrogator and responder units operating from different locations. Theinterrogator  transmits  a  pulse  that  causes  the  responder  to  transmit  a  corresponding  pulse.  Theinterrogator receives the coded return and uses time lapse and azimuth or sweep relationships to displaythe  returns  on  the  PPI.  The  time  needed  for  generation  of  the  return  pulse  causes  a  range  erroramounting to one half mile, generally.7.13.2. Beacons are sometimes coded with a mixture of aircraft identification and flight parameters forARTCC. Aircraft equipped with beacons like the APN-69 can interrogate and respond to like-equippedaircraft. Beacons like the APN-69 use a pulsed code of up to six pulses. The pulse codes are set by theresponder aircraft and will appear on the interrogators PPI. The first pulse will be in the relative positionof the responder with successive pulses trailing. The range between aircraft is equal to the range of thefirst pulse (minus one half NM) and the azimuth is measured through the middle of the pulse length.186AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20017.13.3.  Two  blocking  circuits  are  included  in  the  units  to  prevent  interference  from  radar  on  otherfrequencies  or  a  return  of  the  interrogating  pulse.  This  sometimes  prevents  a  ring  around  where  falseazimuth inputs are presented on the PPI. In such cases, excessive gain causes returns to be picked up byside lobes of the antenna. Figure 7.13 is an example of a beacon return on the scope.Figure 7.13. Radar Beacon Returns.7.14.  Sensitivity  Time  Constant  (STC).  Most  radar  sets  produce  a  hot  spot  in  the  center  of  theradarscope  because  the  high-gain  setting  required  to  amplify  the  weak  echoes  of  distant  targetsoveramplifies the strong echoes of nearby targets. If the receiver gain setting is reduced sufficiently toeliminate  the  hot  spot,  distant  returns  are  weakened  or  eliminated  entirely.  The  difficulty  is  mostpronounced when radar is used during low-level navigation; to make best use of the radar, the navigatoris forced to adjust the receiver gain setting constantly. STC solves the problem by increasing the gain asthe electron beam is deflected from the center to the edge of the radarscope, automatically providing anoptimum  gain  setting  for  each  range  displayed.  In  this  manner,  the  hot  spot  is  removed  while  distanttargets are amplified sufficiently. STC controls vary from one model radar set to another. Refer to theappropriate technical order for operating instructions.7.15. Terrain Avoidance Radar. Terrain avoidance radar  gives the aircrew  an  all-weather,  low-levelcapability.  As  mentioned  earlier,  interpreting  mountain  shadows  on  a  normal  radarscope  can  beconfusing.  There  is  no  time  for  indecision  at  low  altitudes  and  at  high  speeds.  Terrain  avoidanceincreases  safety  and  eliminates  confusion  by  displaying  only  those  vertical  obstructions  that  projectabove a selected clearance plane. The two basic types of presentation used with terrain avoidance areillustrated in Figure 7.14.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001187Figure 7.14. Terrain Avoidance Radar Presentations.7.15.1. Plan Display. The plan display is a sector scan presentation that indicates the range and directionof obstructions projecting above a selected clearance plane. The clearance plane can be manually set atany level from 3,000 feet below the aircraft up to the level of the aircraft. Only those peaks projectingabove the clearance plane are displayed;  all other  returns  are  inconsequential  and  are  eliminated.  Thesector scan presentation limits the returns to those ahead of the aircraft. The vertical line represents theground track of the aircraft and ranges are determined by range marks (Figure 7.14).188AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20017.15.2. Profile Display. The profile display, normally received only by the pilot, provides an outline ofthe  terrain  1,500  feet  above  and  below  the  clearance  plane.  Elevations  of  returns  are  representedvertically; azimuth is represented horizontally. This display gives the operator a look up the valley. Thereturns  seen  represent  the  highest  terrain  within  the  selected  range.  The  position  of  the  aircraft  isrepresented by an aircraft symbol on the indicator overlay. Figure 7.14 shows both a 3-mile and a 6-milepresentation.7.16. Array Radars. The family of array radars include phased, planar, and synthetic aperture. Thesesystems differ significantly from conventional radars. A typical radar uses the shape of the antenna tofocus  radiated  energy.  In  contrast,  an  array  electronically  shapes  the  beam  through  a  process  ofconstructive  and  destructive  interference.  The  planar  array,  found  on  most  modern  fighters,electronically focuses the energy and then mechanically scans the antenna through space. A true phasedarray system, like the air defense Patriot missile, both focuses and steers the beam electronically. Thesynthetic aperture array simulates a large antenna by summing the target return over time. Phased arrayradar  has  applications  in  ground  mapping  and  precise  weapons  employment.  All  arrays  have  theadvantage of few moving parts, very rapid updates and the ability to track and engage multiple targets.The disadvantages include cost, complexity, and computer dependency.7.17. Techniques on Radar Usage. Radars currently in use offer variations of special equipment andcapabilities.  The  following  are  techniques  to  use  with  radar  in  common  situations  and  with  specialequipment designed to enhance radar usage. These are basic suggestions that can and should be adaptedto specific aircraft and mission requirements.7.18.  Radar  Fixing.  Techniques  in  radar  fixing  change  from  operator  to  operator  and  most  provideaccurate results. The following are reminders that will affect the fix accuracy if not considered.7.18.1. Radar is an aid to DR. Before any radar return can be accurately identified, the operator shouldbe familiar with a chart of the target area. This chart study relies on knowing the approximate location ofthe aircraft and, therefore, it is essential to radar fixing that the best possible DR position is ascertained.7.18.2. In examining the area surrounding the DR on the chart, attention should be given to details likeroadways and waterways as well as the more prominent urban returns. Cultural returns build up alongsuch byways; therefore, discrepancies between the chart (which could be years old) and the PPI displaycan be more successfully analyzed.7.18.3. Prior to fixing, take care to adjust gain, antenna tilt, and heading marker. If you use a mechanicalcursor, ensure its center is aligned with the sweep origin, or risk parallax error. Do not accept a return onthe scope as the chosen target unless  you've verified it using surrounding returns. Work from chart toscope. If your desired target does not show but you see a return you think you recognize, go back to thechart and verify it before fixing from it.7.18.4. When obtaining fix readings, remember to compensate for inherent scope errors. If the fix is amultirange or multibearing type, choose the targets to provide the optimum cut. When  using  multipletargets, read the returns that are changing their values the fastest closest to fix time. (With multirange, atarget off the nose changes range faster than the one off the wing.)AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011897.19. Slant Range. Once you identify a return, use it to fix the position of the aircraft by measuring itsbearing and distance from a known geographical point. Of particular significance in any discussion ofradar ranging is the subject of slant range versus ground range (Figure 7.l5). Slant range is the straight-line  distance  between  the  aircraft  and  the  target,  while  ground  range  is  the  range  between  the  pointdirectly below the aircraft and the target.Figure 7.15. Slant Range Compared to Ground Range.7.19.1. To fix the position of the aircraft, the navigator is interested in the ground range from the fixingpoint,  yet the fixed range markers  give slant range. The trick  is  to  determine  the  critical  range  belowwhich the navigator must convert slant range to ground range to keep fixes accurate. This range may bedetermined by a simple formula:Critical slant range = Absolute Altitude (in K)-57.19.2. Slant range can be converted to ground range, using the latitude and longitude lines of a chart ifthe slant range table is not available. Set dividers at the slant range distance to the target. Place one pointof  the  dividers  at  the  equivalent  (in  NM)  of  the  aircraft's  altitude  on  the  longitude  line.  Set  the  otherpoint where it meets a nearby latitude line. Without moving point, reset the first point along the latitudeline  at  the  intersection  of  the  latitude  and  longitude  lines.  The  distance  is  the  ground  range  in  NM(Figure 7.16). Slant range correction charts are provided in Figures 7.17.7.20. Side Lobe Interference. Side lobes are small extra fields of energy separate from the main beam,and are  an inherent flaw in any  radar. These side lobes are rarely strong enough to  generate a  return.However,  when  a  large  or  very  reflective  target  comes  into  this  field  or  when  the  transmitter  powerincreases  the  size  of  the  lobes,  multiple  shadow  returns  may  appear  on  the  PPI.  Curved  strobesoriginating at the center of the radarscope are also caused by the side lobes of the radar receiving energyfrom your radar or others in the same frequency range. Solutions to this problem include reducing thegain or changing transmitter frequencies.190AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 7.16. Slant Range From Chart.Figure 7.17. Slant Range Correction Chart.7.21. Target-Timing Wind. This is a technique for obtaining a wind by using radar targets to providetrack  and  GS  of  an  aircraft.  The  MB-4  computer  solution  for  wind  requires  true  heading  (TH),  trueairspeed (TAS), drift angle (DA), and GS. The first two can be derived from basic aircraft instruments(indicated airspeed [IAS] and compass). The other two require a target which can be tracked for about 4minutes and which is preferably within 20 degrees of the radar heading marker. The identity of the targetis irrelevant, but it should not be too big to make range and bearing determination vague, or so small thatit  will  disappear.  Choose  a  target  that  has  just  appeared  on  the  scope  and  read  its  range  and  bearing.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001191Also, start a stopwatch or note the minute and seconds on a clock so elapsed time can be measured. Atleast two ranges and bearings should be taken over a distance of 20 to 25 NM. One technique is to fix atthe 40, 30, and 20 NM range marks to space the fixes evenly. At the last observation, stop the watch anddetermine the elapsed time. On the windface grid of the MB-4, place the grommet over the center markof the top reference line. Turn the compass rose to the azimuth of the first fix. Using your own values foreach of the horizontal grid lines, plot a point representing the range of the first fix (going down). Then,turn the compass rose to the  azimuth of  the  second  fix  and  plot  a  point  (measuring  from  the  top  lineagain) representing the range of the second fix. Repeat for the successive fixes (Figure 7.18). To solvefor the wind, rotate the compass rose so that the three plotted lines are parallel to the vertical grid linesand read the track under the true index of the compass rose. Then, determine the GS by measuring thedistance between the first and last plotted points using the grid lines. Using track and TH, find the DAand use the standard MB-4 wind solution.EXAMPLE:TH = 320oTAS = 400 knotsTime = 3 + 30 minSolution:TC = 316oGS = 352 knotsWind = 349o/53 knotsFix 1Fix 2Fix 3310o308o305o40 NM30 NM20 NM7.22. Airborne Radar Approach (ARA). The ARA is as a ground controlled approach in reverse. It isan alternate procedure in marginal weather  conditions, normally when  no other approach is  available.However, navigators should practice often to prepare for the time when it is the only way of making asafe  landing.  Even  during  normal  approaches,  the  navigator  should  monitor  aircraft  position  both  forpractice and as a backup to the regular approach.7.22.1. During the ARA the navigator uses the radar to direct the aircraft to a point on the final approachwhere the pilot can complete the landing visually.7.22.2.  There  are  two  main  phases  in  the  ARA,  the  letdown  and  the  approach  itself.  The  letdown  isnormally  accomplished  from  a  nearby  VOR  or  TACAN  station  according  to  published  procedures.  Ifthese are not available, the navigator must pick a point on the extension of the runway that will provideadequate time for descent and early alignment of the aircraft with the runway.7.22.3.  During  the  approach,  the  procedures  vary  with  the  capabilities  of  the  radar.  The  navigatorprovides headings, altitude calls, and distance-to-the-runway information for the pilots while fine tuningthe radar to break out the runway environment, approach lights, and runway itself. Terminal approachplates should be used to locate possible hazards. On radars equipped with computers, use the crosshairsto monitor the distance and direction to the end of the runway; otherwise, use the fixed range markers.When  using  movable  etched  cursors  for  runway  alignment  reference,  the  landing  environment  movesalong  the  cursor  if  you  are  on  course  and  heading.  If  the  field  return  drifts  from  the  cursor,  turn  theaircraft. Remember to monitor drift angle (DA) changes due to wind shifts during descent.192AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 7.18. Target Timing Wind Solution.7.22.4. Use caution when flying an ARA without backup NAVAIDs for orientation and when using anAZ STAB setting other than north orientation. Be familiar with runway location and direction relative tosurrounding returns. It is possible to fly an apparently good approach to the field only to find that theaircraft  is  over  the  threshold  but  considerably  off  the  runway  heading.  Again,  a  point  on  the  runwayextension  should  he  used  for  initial  alignment  with  the  runway  to  avoid  this  problem.  Consult  theappropriate aircraft tech order for procedures for each type of radar.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20011937.23. Station Keeping. Station keeping is a technique using radar to maintain a fixed position within aformation.  Formations  may  require  separations  of  a  mile  or  more.  At  these  distances,  radar  is  moreprecise than the visual method for staying in position. In addition, it is superior to the visual method offormation flying because it is an all-weather method.7.23.1. Maintain formation position with fixed or variable range markers or with the  crosshairs.  Withradars  having  directional  pencil-type  beam,  returns  appear  on  any  portion  of  the  scope.  On  others,aircraft in the formation may appear in the altitude hole. To use the basic radar set for station keeping,consider altitude separation, angular offset, and airspeed adjustments. The relative importance of each ofthese considerations depends on the type of formation being flown. Basic tuning for station keeping isbest achieved by placing the antenna in pencil beam, adjusting the tilt to level, and setting AZ STAB inthe relative position.7.23.2.  In  trail  formations,  the  most  important  aspect  of  formation  position  is  airspeed.  Navigators  infollower aircraft must monitor formation position and adjust airspeed to stay in position. During a radiosilent mission, follower navigators must think as lead to compute the proper airspeed. It's not sufficientto  match  the  lead  aircraft's  airspeed.  Compensation  must  also  be  made  for  altitude  differences.  As  ageneral  rule,  3  knots  of  IAS  decrease  for  every  500  feet  above  lead's  altitude  will  usually  keep  trueairspeeds close.7.23.3.  In  an  offset  formation,  the  combination  of  airspeed  and  angular  adjustments  complicates  theproblem.  You  should  mark  the  angular  offset  and  desired  separation  on  the  scope  with  either  amechanical or an electronic cursor. Avoid extreme corrections when flying in formations.7.23.4. This example presents one basic way to establish a position at a 60o offset at 1 NM (Figure 7.19).First,  maneuver  the  aircraft  so  that  the  lead's  radar  return  is  at  the  desired  distance  from  the  headingmarker (in this  case  1  NM)  and  turn  to  lead's  heading.  Secondly,  adjust  airspeed  so  that  lead's  returnmoves parallel to the heading marker toward the angular offset (this mechanical cursor is offset 60o fromthe  heading  flash).  Once  in  position,  adjust  airspeed  to  match  leads.  Equipment  and  capabilities  varyamong aircraft, so expand upon these basics as necessary.7.23.5. Aircraft equipped with station-keeping equipment (SKE) should follow the recommendations oftheir associated manuals.7.24. Weather Avoidance. Severe turbulence, hail, and icing associated with thunderstorms constitutesevere  hazards  to  flight.  You  must  avoid  these  thunderstorms  whenever  possible.  Airborne  weatherradar, if operated and interpreted properly, can be an invaluable aid in avoiding thunderstorm areas.7.24.1. You must be aware of factors and limitations affecting thunderstorm radar returns to get the mostout  of  the  radar.  Some  of  these  factors  aren't  meteorological  and  depend  on  the  characteristics  of  theradar  and  the  way  it  is  used.  The  same  weather  target  can  vary  considerably  in  its  appearance  fromground  mapping  mode  to  weather  mode.  Navigators  must  ensure  they  use  the  radar  as  intended  forweather avoidance. Primary meteorological factors that affect radar returns are the amount of moisturein  the  weather  target  and  atmospheric  absorption  characteristics  between  the  radar  antenna  and  thetarget.194Figure 7.19. Station Keeping.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20017.24.2. The predominant weather-induced returns on most radarscopes are caused by precipitation-sizewater droplets, not by clouds. Intense returns indicate the presence of very large droplets. These largedroplets  are  generally  associated  with  the  most  hazardous  phenomena;  those  with  strong  verticalcurrents  which  are  necessary  to  maintain  these  droplets  in  the  cloud.  It  is  possible,  however,  toencounter such strong turbulence in an echo-free area or even in an adjacent cloud-free area, so avoidingareas giving intense returns will not necessarily  guarantee safe  flight in the vicinity of thunderstorms.Refer  to  your  command  guidance  for  weather  avoidance  distances.  Make  careful  note  of  all  areasforecast to have the potential for hazardous weather.7.24.3. Generally, the map mode of the radar with a moderate amount of gain applied is adequate forobtaining  a  return  from  hazardous  cells.  Sometimes,  ground  returns  hamper  detection  in  the  area  byhiding  the  storm.  This  can  occur  in  mountainous  areas  where  ground  returns  are  similar  and  airmasslifting action breeds the cells. For these reasons, raising the radar tilt or switching to pencil beam  (orboth) are techniques that will aid weather detection.7.24.4. There  are two types of weather  avoidance with radar: (1)  avoidance of isolated  thunderstormsand (2) penetration of a line of thunderstorms. Avoid an isolated return by first identifying it and thencircumnavigating it at a safe distance.7.24.5. After detecting a weather system, determine its extent. Analyze the weather's layout relative toplanned  track  and  decide  either  to  deviate  around  it  or  penetrate  the  line.  If  the  system  is  complex,remember your deviation could worsen the situation by flying into a sucker hole, where a solid systemcould  surround  the  aircraft.  Sometimes,  what  seems  to  be  a  good  heading  at  short  range  will  seemfoolish when viewed at long range. Remember that turning around is always an option and ARTCC cansometimes assist in weather analysis.7.24.6. A simple technique for flying around weather at a preferred distance (say 20 NM) is the flyingdisc technique. Imagine the aircraft is a disc defined by the 20 NM range mark on the PPI. The headingmarker is the nose of the disc. Draw an imaginary tangent from the disc to the edge of the weather (orAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001195use  a  pencil  or  plotter).  Turn  the  aircraft  the  same  number  of  degrees  that  it  would  take  to  get  theheading marker to fire parallel to the tangent. After the turn, recheck the heading in the same manner.This technique works best with a scan of more than 180o (Figure 7.20).Figure 7.20. Weather Avoidance.7.24.7. Penetration of a line of thunderstorms is a last resort and presents a different problem. Since theline may extend for hundreds of miles, circumnavigation is not practical or even possible.  If no othercourse of action exists, the main objective is to avoid the more dangerous areas in the line.7.24.8. Figure 7.21 shows an example of frontal penetration using radar. An iso-echo equipped radar candiscriminate between the safe and violent areas. Without it, decreasing the gain will work to highlightthe worst areas by leaving the densest water cells as the last returns on the PPI. Upon approaching theline, the navigator determines an area which has weak or no returns and which is large enough to allowavoidance  of  all  intense  returns  by  the  recommended  distances  throughout  penetration.  The  navigatordirects the aircraft to that point, making the penetration at right angles to the line so as to remain in thebad  weather  areas  for  the  shortest  possible  time.  Avoid  the  dangerous  echoes  by  a  safe  distance.Penetration  of  a  line  of  severe  thunderstorms  is  always  a  potentially  dangerous  procedure.  Attempt  itonly when you must continue the flight and cannot circumnavigate the line. Always advise ARTCC ofyour intentions when deviating from your flight-planned route.Figure 7.21. Penetration of Thunderstorm Area.196AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20017.25.  Heading  Marker  Correction.  For  optimum  accuracy,  it  may  sometimes  become  necessary  tocorrect  the  bearings  taken  on  the  various  targets.  This  necessity  arises  when  (1)  the  heading  markerreading does not agree with the TH of the aircraft when azimuth stabilization is used, or (2) the headingmarker reading does not agree with 360o when azimuth stabilization is not used.EXAMPLE: If the TH is 125o and the heading marker reads 120o, all of the returns on the scope willindicate a bearing that is 5o less than it should be. Therefore, if a target indicates a bearing of 50o, add 5oto the bearing before plotting it. Conversely, if the heading marker reads 45o when the TH is 040o, all ofthe scope returns will indicate a bearing that is 5o more than it should be. Therefore, if a target indicatesa bearing of 275o, subtract 5o from the bearing before plotting it. The greater the distance to the targetfrom the aircraft, the more important this heading marker correction becomes.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001197Chapter 8CELESTIAL CONCEPTSSection 8A— Introduction to Celestial Concepts8.1.  Basics.  Celestial  navigation  is  a  universal  aid  to  dead  reckoning  (DR).  Because  it  is  availableworldwide and is independent of electronic equipment, it is a very reliable method of fixing the positionof the aircraft. It cannot be jammed and emanates no signals. Each celestial observation yields one lineof position (LOP). In the daytime, when the sun may be the only visible celestial body, a single LOPmay be all you can get. At night, when numerous bodies are available, LOPs obtained observing two ormore bodies may be crossed to determine a fix.8.1.1.  It  is  impossible  to  predict,  in  so  many  miles,  the  accuracy  of  a  celestial  fix.  Celestial  accuracydepends  on  the  navigator's  skill,  the  type  and  condition  of  the  equipment,  and  the  weather.  With  theincrease in aircraft speed and range, celestial navigation is very demanding. Fixes must be plotted andused as quickly as possible.8.1.2. You don't have to be an astronomer or mathematician to establish a celestial LOP. Your ability touse  a  sextant  is  a  matter  of  practice,  and  specially  designed  celestial  tables  have  reduced  thecomputations to simple arithmetic.8.1.3.  Although  you  don't  need  to  understand  astronomy  in  detail  to  establish  an  accurate  celestialposition,  celestial  work  and  celestial  LOPs  mean  more  if  you  understand  the  basics  of  celestialastronomy.  Celestial  astronomy  includes  the  navigational  bodies  in  the  universe  and  their  relativemotions. Although there are an infinite number of heavenly bodies, celestial navigation utilizes only 63of them: 57 stars, the moon, the sun, Venus, Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn.8.2.  Assumptions.  We  make  certain  assumptions  to  simplify  celestial  navigation.  These  assumptionshelp you obtain accurate LOPs without a detailed knowledge of celestial astronomy. However, celestialpositioning  is  more  than  extracting  numbers  from  various  books.  A  working  knowledge  of  celestialconcepts will help you crosscheck your computations.8.2.1. First, assume the earth is a perfect sphere. That puts every point on the earth's surface equidistantfrom  the  center,  forming  the  terrestrial  sphere.  Next,  assume  the  terrestrial  sphere  is  the  center  of  aninfinite  universe.  Finally,  assume  all  other  bodies,  except  the  moon,  are  an  infinite  distance  from  theterrestrial  sphere.  Imagine  them  on  the  inside  surface  of  an  enormous  concentric  sphere,  the  celestialsphere. If the stars, planets, and sun are infinitely distant from the earth's center, then the earth's surface(or aircraft's altitude) is approximately the center of the universe.8.2.2. Ptolemy proposed the celestial concept of the universe in AD 127. He said the earth is the centerof the universe, and all bodies rotate about the earth from east to west. In the relatively short periods oftime involved with celestial positioning, you can assume that all bodies on the celestial sphere rotate atthe same rate. In actuality, over months or years, the planets move among the stars at varying rates.8.2.3. Establishing an artificial celestial sphere with an infinite radius simplifies computations for threereasons.  First,  since  the  terrestrial  and  celestial  spheres  are  geometrically  similar,  every  point  on  the198AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001celestial sphere has a corresponding point on the terrestrial sphere and; conversely, every point on theterrestrial sphere has a corresponding point on the celestial sphere.8.2.4.  Second,  the  celestial  sphere's  infinite  radius  dwarfs  variations  in  the  observer's  location.  Aninfinite  radius  means  all  light  rays  from  the  celestial  body  arrive  parallel,  so  the  angle  is  the  samewhether viewed at the earth's center, on the surface, or at the aircraft's altitude.8.2.5.  Third,  the  relationships  are  valid  for  all  bodies  on  the  celestial  sphere.  Because  the  moon  isrelatively  close  to  the  earth,  it  must  be  treated  differently.  With  certain  corrections,  the  moon  stillprovides an accurate LOP. This will be addressed in Chapter 10.8.2.6. Because the celestial sphere and terrestrial sphere are concentric, each sphere contains an equator,two poles, meridians, and parallels of latitude or declination. The observer on earth has a correspondingpoint directly overhead on the celestial sphere called the zenith. A celestial body has a  correspondingpoint  on  the  terrestrial  sphere  directly  below  it  called  the  subpoint  or  geographic  position.  At  thesubpoint, the light rays from the body are perpendicular to the earth's surface. See Figures 8.1 and 8.2.8.2.7.  Consistent  with  the  celestial  assumptions,  the  earth  and  the  celestial  meridians  don't  rotate.  Allbodies  on  the  celestial  sphere  rotate  15o  per  hour  past  the  celestial  meridians.  The  moon  moves  atapproximately 14.5o per hour.Section 8B— Motion of Celestial Bodies8.3. Basics. All the celestial bodies have two types of motion, absolute and apparent. Apparent motion isimportant  to  navigators.  Apparent  motion  is  the  motion  of  one  celestial  body  as  perceived  by  anobserver on another moving celestial body. Since apparent motion is relative, it is essential to establishthe reference point for that motion. For example,  the  apparent  motion  of  Venus  would  be  different  ifobserved from the earth or the sun.8.4. Apparent Motion. The earth's rotation and revolution causes the apparent motion of the celestialbodies. Rotation causes celestial bodies to appear to rise in the east, climb to a maximum height, then setin the west. All bodies appear to move along a diurnal circle, approximately parallel to the plane of theequator.8.4.1.  The  apparent  effect  of  rotation  varies  with  the  observer's  latitude.  At  the  equator,  the  bodiesappear to rise and set perpendicular to the horizon. Each body is above the horizon for approximately 12hours each day. At the North and South Poles, a different phenomenon occurs. The same group of starsis continually above the horizon; they neither rise nor set, but move on a plane parallel to the equator.This characteristic explains the periods of extended daylight, twilight, and darkness at higher latitudes.The remainder of the earth is a combination of these two extremes; that is, some bodies will rise and set,while others will continually remain above the horizon.8.4.2. The greater the northerly declination of a body, the higher it appears in the sky to an observer atthe  North  Pole.  Polaris,  with  a  declination  of  almost  90o,  appears  overhead.  Bodies  with  southerndeclination are not visible from the North Pole.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001199Figure 8.1. Celestial Points and Subpoints on Earth Have the Same Relationship.Figure 8.2. Elements of the Celestial Sphere.8.4.3. A circumpolar body appears to revolve about the pole and never set. If the angular distance of thebody from the elevated pole is less than the observer's latitude, the body is circumpolar. For example,the declination of Dubhe is 62o N. Therefore, it is located at an angle of 90o – 62o from the North Pole,or 28o. So, an observer located above 28o N will view Dubhe as circumpolar. Although Figure 8.3 usesthe North Pole, the same characteristics can be observed from the South Pole.200AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 8.3. Some Bodies Are Circumpolar.8.4.4. If the earth stopped rotating, the effect of the earth's revolution on the apparent motion of celestialbodies  would  be  obvious.  The  sun  would  appear  to  circle  around  the  earth  once  each  year.  It  wouldcover 360o in 365 days, or move eastward at slightly less than 1 degree per day. The stars would move atthe  same  rate.  (That's  why  different  constellations  are  visible  at  different  times  of  the  year.  Everyevening the same star appears to rise 4 minutes earlier.)8.4.5. After half a year, when the earth reached the opposite extreme of its orbit, its dark side would beturned in the opposite direction in space, facing a new field of stars. Hence, an observer at the equatorwould  see  an  entirely  different  sky  at  midnight  in  June  than  the  one  that  appeared  at  midnight  inDecember. In fact, the stars seen at midnight in June are those that were above the horizon at midday inDecember.8.5. Seasons. The annual variation of the sun's declination and the consequent change of the seasons arecaused by the revolution of the earth (Figure 8.4). If the celestial equator coincided with the ecliptic, thesun would always be overhead at the equator, and its declination would always be zero. However, theearth's  axis  is  inclined  about  66  1/2o  to  the  plane  of  the  earth's  orbit,  and  the  plane  of  the  equator  isinclined about 23 1/2o. Throughout the year, the axis points in the same direction. That is, the axis of theearth in one part of the orbit is parallel to the axis of the earth in any other part of the orbit (Figure 8.5).8.5.1. In June, the North Pole is inclined toward the sun so that the sun is at a maximum distance fromthe plane of the equator. About June 22, at the solstice, the sun has its greatest northern declination.8.5.2.  The  solstice  brings  the  long  days  of  summer,  while  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere,  the  days  areshortest. This is the beginning of summer for the Northern Hemisphere and of winter for the SouthernHemisphere. Six months later, the axis is still pointing in the same direction; but, since the earth is at theopposite  side  of  its  orbit  and  the  sun,  the  North  Pole  is  inclined  away  from  the  Sun.  At  the  winterAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001201solstice,  about  December  21,  the  sun  has  its  greatest  southern  declination.  Days  are  shortest  in  theNorthern Hemisphere, and winter is beginning.8.5.3. Halfway between the two solstices, the axis of the earth is inclined neither toward nor away fromthe sun, and the sun is on the plane of the equator. These positions correspond to the beginning springand fall.Figure 8.4. Seasonal Changes of Earth's Position.202AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 8.5. Ecliptic With Solstices and Equinoxes.Section 8C— Celestial Coordinates8.6. Basics. Celestial bodies and the observer's zenith may be positioned on the celestial sphere, using acoordinate system similar to that of the earth. Terrestrial lines of latitude correspond to celestial parallelsof declination. Lines of longitude establish the celestial meridians.8.6.1. The observer's celestial meridian is a great circle containing the zenith, the nadir, and the celestialpoles (Figure 8.2). A line extended from the observer's zenith, through the center of the earth, intersectsthe  celestial  sphere  at  the  observer's  nadir,  the  point  on  the  celestial  sphere  directly  beneath  theobserver's position. The poles divide the celestial meridians into upper and lower branches. The upperbranch contains the observer's zenith. The lower branch contains the nadir.8.6.2.  A  second  great  circle  on  the  celestial  sphere  is  the  hour  circle.  The  hour  circle  contains  thecelestial body and the celestial poles. Unlike celestial meridians, which remain stationary, hour circlesrotate 15o per hour. Hour circles also contain upper and lower branches. The upper branch contains thebody. Again, the moon's hour circle moves at a different rate. The subpoint is the point on the earth'ssurface directly beneath the celestial body.8.6.3. You can locate any body on the celestial sphere relative to the celestial equator and the Greenwichmeridian using declination and Greenwich hour angle.8.7.  Declination  (Dec).  Declination  is  the  angular  distance  a  celestial  body  is  north  or  south  of  thecelestial equator measured along the hour circle. It ranges from 0o to 90o and corresponds to latitude.8.8.  Greenwich  Hour  Angle  (GHA).  GHA  is  the  angular  distance  measured  westward  from  theGreenwich celestial meridian to the upper branch of the hour circle. It has a range of 0o to 360o. The AirAlmanac lists the GHA and the Dec of the sun, moon, four planets, and Aries. The subpoint's latitudematches  its  Dec,  and  its  longitude  correlates  to  its  GHA,  but  not  exactly.  GHA  is  always  measuredAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001203westward  from  the  Greenwich  celestial  meridian,  and  longitude  is  measured  in  the  shortest  directionfrom the Greenwich meridian to the observer's meridian.8.8.1. The following are examples of converting a body's celestial coordinates to its subpoint's terrestrialcoordinates.  If  the  GHA  is  less  than  180o,  then  the  subpoint  is  in  the  Western  Hemisphere  and  GHAequals longitude. When the GHA is  greater than 180o, the subpoint is in the  Eastern  Hemisphere  andlongitude equals 360o – GHA. Again, Dec and latitude are equal (Figure 8.6).Dec S13o-15'—Lat 13o-15' SGHA 135o-00'—Longitude 135o-00' WDec N11o-32'—Lat 11o-32' NGHA 290o-00'—Longitude 070o-00' EFigure 8.6. Declination of a Body Corresponds to a Parallel of Latitude.8.8.2. You will use two other hour angles in celestial navigation in addition to GHA (Figure 8.7), localhour  angle  (LHA),  and  sidereal  hour  angle  (SHA).  LHA  is  the  angular  distance  from  the  observer'scelestial meridian clockwise to the hour circle. LHA is computed by applying the local longitude to theGHA  of  the  body.  In  the  Western  Hemisphere,  LHA  equals  GHA  -  W  Long,  and  in  the  EasternHemisphere, LHA equals GHA + E Long (Figure 8.8). When the LHA is 0, the body's hour circle andthe upper branch of the observer's celestial meridian are collocated, and the body is in transit. If the LHAis 180, the hour circle is coincident with the lower branch of the observer's celestial meridian. SHA isused with the first point of Aries. The first point of Aries is the point where the sun appears to cross thecelestial equator from south to north on the vernal equinox or first day of spring. Though not absolutelystationary relative to the stars, Aries moves so slowly that we consider it fixed on the celestial equatorfor as long as a  year. The SHA is the angular measurement from the hour circle of Aries to the star'shour circle (Figure 8.9). Aries and the stars move together so the SHA remains constant for a year.204AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 8.7. Greenwich Hour Angle.Figure 8.8. Local Hour Angle.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 8.9. Sidereal Hour Angle.205Section 8D— Use of the Air Almanac8.9. Basics. Although the Air Almanac contains astronomical amounts of data, most of it is devoted totabulating  the  GHA  of  Aries  and  the  GHA  and  Declination  (Dec)  of  the  sun,  moon,  and  the  threenavigational planets most favorably located for observation. Enter the daily pages with Greenwich dateand GMT to extract the GHA and Dec of a celestial body.8.10.  Finding  GHA  and  Dec.  The  GHA  is  listed  for  10-minute  intervals  on  each  daily  sheet.  If  theobservation time is listed, read the GHA and Dec directly under the proper column opposite the time.8.10.1. For example, find the sun's GHA and Dec at GMT 0540 on 11 August 1995 (Figure 8.10). TheGHA is 263o-41' and Dec is N 15o-24'. (Extractions of GHA and Dec are to the nearest whole minute.)To convert these values to the subpoint's geographical coordinates, latitude is North 15o-24'. When GHAis greater than 180o, subtract it from 360o to get east longitude. The subpoint's longitude in this exampleis (360o-00' minus 263o-41') East 96o-19'.8.10.2. When you don't observe at a 10-minute interval, use the time immediately before the observationtime. Then use the Interpolation of GHA table on the inside front cover of the Air Almanac or the backof the star chart and add the increment to the GHA (Figure 8.11).8.10.3. For example, on 11 August 1995, you observe the sun at 1012 GMT. Enter Figure 8.10 to findthe GHA listed for 1010 (331o-11'). Since the observation was 2 minutes after the listed time, enter theInterpolation of GHA table (Figure 8.11) and find the correction listed for 2 minutes of time (30'). Addthis correction to the listed GHA to determine the sun's exact GHA at 1012 (331o-41'). The Dec for thesame time is N 15o-21'. Thus, at the time of the observation, the subpoint of the sun is at latitude 15o-21'N, longitude (360o-00' minus 331o-41') 028o-19' E.206AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 8.10. Daily Page From Air Almanac—11 August 1995.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20012078.10.4.  You  can  find  the  GHA  and  Dec  of  a  planet  in  almost  the  same  way  as  the  sun.  Because  theplanet's Dec change slowly, they are recorded only at hourly intervals. Use the Dec listed for the entirehour. For example, to find the GHA and Dec of Jupiter at 1109 GMT, 11 August 1995, enter the correctdaily page (Figure 8.10) for the time of 1100 GMT. The GHA is 240o-35' and the Dec is S20o-40'. Enterthe Interpolation of GHA table under sun, etc., (Figure 8.11) to get the adjustment for 9 minutes of time,2o-15'. Therefore, GHA is 242o-50'. Jupiter's subpoint is at latitude 20o-40' S, longitude (360o-00' minus242o-50') 117o-10' E.8.10.5.  If  you  need  to  find  an  accurate  GHA  and  Dec  without  the  Air  Almanac,  you  can  find  theprocedures and applicable tables in Pub. No. 249, Volume 1 for Aries or Volume 2 or 3 for the sun.8.11. Finding GHA and Dec of Moon. The moon moves across the sky at a different rate than othercelestial  bodies.  In  the  Interpolation  of  GHA  table,  the  intervals  for  the  moon  are  listed  in  the  rightcolumn where the values for the sun, Aries, and the planets are in the left column.8.11.1. The interpolation of GHA table is a critical table and the increment is opposite the interval inwhich the difference of GMT occurs. If the difference (for example, 06'-31" for the moon) is an exacttabular value, take the upper (or right) of the two possible increments (that is, 1o-34'). The up or rightrule applies to all critical tables.8.11.2.  For  example,  at  1136  GMT  on  11  August  1995  you  observe  the  moon.  The  followinginformation is from the Air Almanac (Figures 8.10 and 8.11):GHA of moon at 1130 GMT 163o 16'GHA correction for 6 minutes 1o 27'GHA 164o 43'Dec S8o 00'Thus at 1136Z, the moon's subpoint is located at S 8o-00', longitude 164o-43'W.8.12.  Finding  GHA  and  Dec  of  a  Star.  The  stars  and  the  first  point  of  Aries  remain  fixed  in  theirrelative positions in space, so the gas of the stars and Aries change at the same rate. Rather than list theGHA and Dec of every star throughout the day, the Air Almanac lists the GHA of Aries at 10-minuteintervals and gives the sidereal hour angle (SHA) of the stars. The GHA of a star for any time can befound by adding the GHA of Aries and the SHA of the star. The GHA of a star is used to precomp anystar that falls within 29o (declination) of the equator using Volume 2 or Volume 3.8.12.1. The table, STARS, is inside the front cover of the almanac and on the back of the star chart. Thistable lists navigational stars and the following information for each star: the number corresponding tothe sky diagram in the back, the name, the magnitude or relative brightness, the SHA, the Dec, whetherused in Pub. No. 249, and stars that can be used with Dec tables. NOTE: If you need a higher degree ofaccuracy, the SHA and Dec of the stars are listed to tenths of a degree in the Air Almanac's appendix.8.12.2. For example, at 0124 GMT on 11 August 1995, you observe Altair. To find the GHA and Declook at the extracts from the tables in Figures 8.11 and 8.12.208AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001GHA at 0120 GMT:GHA correction for 4 minutes:GHA for 0124:SHA AltairGHA for Altair at 0124:Dec Altair339o-03'1o-00'340o-03'62o-21'42o-24'N8o-52'Thus the subpoint of Altair is 08o-52' N 042o-24' W.Figure 8.11.

All  the  celestial  concepts  and  assumptions  you've  learned  may  help  you  obtain  acelestial  LOP.  A  celestial  LOP  is  simply  a  circle  plotted  with  the  center  at  the  subpoint  and  a  radiusequal  to  the  distance  from  the  observer  to  the  subpoint.  To  accurately  compute  this  distance  and  thedirection  to  the  subpoint  of  the  body,  you  must  initially  position  the  subpoint  and  then  measure  theangular displacement of the body above the horizon. GHA and Dec position the body, and the sextantmeasures the height above the horizon. A basic knowledge of celestial theory and LOPs will help youappreciate celestial navigation and detect errors. The next section explains how angular displacement ismeasured.Section 8E— Celestial Horizon8.14.  Basics.  You  use  a  sextant  to  measure  a  body's  angular  displacement  above  the  horizon.  Thecelestial horizon is a plane passing through the earth's center perpendicular to the zenith-nadir axis. Thevisual horizon approximates this plane at the earth's surface.  Figure 8.13 depicts the zenith-nadir  axisand the celestial horizon. The angular displacement you see through a sextant is the height observed, orHo.  Ho  is  measured  along  the  vertical  circle  above  the  horizon.  The  vertical  circle  is  a  great  circlecontaining the zenith, nadir, and celestial body. The body's altitude is the same whether measured at theearth's surface from an artificial horizon or at the center of the earth from the celestial horizon becausethese horizons are parallel and the light rays from the body are essentially parallel. Figure 8.14 shows210AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001that the infinite celestial sphere makes the difference in angle for light rays arriving at different points onthe earth infinitesimal.Figure 8.13. Celestial Horizon is 90o From Observer Zenith and Nadir.Figure 8.14. Parallel Lines Make Equal Angles With Parallel Planes.8.14.1.  The  angle  between  light  rays  is  called  parallax.  In  Figure  8.15,  parallax  is  shown  at  itsmaximum; that is, when the observer and the subpoint are separated by 90o. Since the earth's radius istiny compared to the infinite distance to the stars, the angle p is very small. For the sun, angle p is anegligible 9 seconds of arc or 0.15 NM. Observed altitudes from either the artificial or celestial horizonare practically the same.8.14.2. The bubble in a sextant or artificial horizon is most used by navigators. As in a carpenter's level,a  bubble  indicates  the  apparent  vertical  and  horizontal.  With  the  bubble,  the  navigator  can  level  thesextant and establish an artificial horizon parallel to the plane of the celestial horizon. Figure 8.16 showsthat  the  plane  of  the  artificial  (bubble)  horizon  and  the  plane  of  the  celestial  horizon  are  parallel  andAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001211separated  by  the  earth's  radius.  Compared  to  the  vast  distances  of  space,  the  radius  of  the  earth  isinconsequential. Thus, the artificial horizon and the celestial horizon are nearly identical.Figure 8.15. Parallax.Figure 8.16. The Two Planes Are Parallel.8.15. Observed Altitude. The distance of the observer from the subpoint and a body's Ho are related.(Figure 8.17). When the body is directly overhead, the Ho is 90o, and the subpoint and the observer'sposition are collocated. When the Ho is 0o, the body  is on the horizon and the subpoint is 90o (5,400NM)  from  the  observer's  position  (See  Figure  8.18,  where  C  is  the  center  of  the  earth,  AB  is  theobserver's horizon, and S is the subpoint of the body). Since the sum of the angles in a triangle equals180o, the angle OX is equal to 180o – (Ho + P). The sum of the angles on a straight line equals 180o, soangle OXC is equal to Ho + P. The horizon AB being tangent to the earth at O is perpendicular to OC, aradius of the earth. Thus, angle OCX equals 90o (Ho + P). The preceding discussion showed that angle Pis negligible, so this angle becomes 90o – Ho. The arc on the surface subtended by the angle OCX at thecenter of the earth is arc OS. This arc then is equal to 90o – Ho.212AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 8.17. Measure Altitude From Celestial Horizon Along Vertical Circle.Figure 8.18. Finding Observed Altitude.8.15.1. The distance from the subpoint to the observer is the zenith distance or co-alt and is computedusing the astronomical triangle described in Chapter 9. Basically, the zenith distance equals 90o minusthe Ho (Figure 8.19). The figures are then converted to NM by multiplying the number of degrees by 60and adding in the odd minutes of arc.Ho therefore, co-alttherefore, co-altZenith DistanceZenith DistanceZenith distance is the radius of the circle which becomes the celestial LOP.= 37o26'= 90o – 37o26'= 52o34'= (52o x 60) + 34'= 3,154 NMAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20012138.15.2. This circle is called the circle of equal altitude (Figure 8.20), as anyone located on it will view anidentical Ho. Now that you can determine the distance to the subpoint, you must next find the direction.Figure 8.19. Co-Altitude and Zenith Distance.Figure 8.20. Constructing a Circle of Equal Altitude.214AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20018.16. True Azimuth (Zn). The direction to a body from an observer is called Zn. A celestial body's Znis the true bearing (TB) to its subpoint. The Zn is the angle measured at the observer's position from truenorth (TN) clockwise through 360o to the great circle arc joining the observer's position with subpoint,as illustrated in Figure 8.21. If you could measure the Zn when you measure its altitude, you could havea  fix.  Unfortunately,  there  is  no  instrument  in  the  aircraft  which  will  measure  Zn  accurately  enough.Except in the case of a very high body (85-90 degrees), if you observe a body with a Ho of 40o and youmismeasure the Zn by 1 degree, the fix will be 50 NM off.Figure 8.21. Relationship of True Azimuth to an Observer.8.17. Celestial Fix. Since you cannot normally fix off a single body, you will usually need to cross twoor more LOPs. The fix position is the intersection of the LOPs. A celestial LOP is a circle as shown inFigure 8.22. When two celestial LOPs are plotted, they intersect at two points, only one of which can beyour position. In practice, these two intersections usually are so far apart that dead reckoning removesall doubt as to which is correct.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 8.22. Celestial Fix With Two Bodies.215216AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Chapter 9COMPUTING ALTITUDE AND TRUE AZIMUTHSection 9A— Introduction9.1. Basics. This chapter discusses the procedures and some of the tables used to compute a celestial lineof  position  (LOP).  Some  of  the  tables  used  to  resolve  the  LOP,  including  the  Air  Almanac,  werepreviously  mentioned.  First,  we'll  discuss  the  astronomical  triangle  upon  which  the  tables  are  based.Then we'll cover how to determine the local hour angle (LHA) of Aries and the LHA of a star.Section 9B— LHA and the Astronomical Triangle9.2. Basics. The basic principle of celestial navigation is to consider yourself to be at a certain assumedposition at a given time; then, by means of the sextant, determining how much your basic assumption isin error. At any given time, an observer has a certain relationship to a particular star. The observer is acertain number of nautical miles away from the subpoint, and the body is at a certain true bearing calledtrue azimuth (Zn), measured from the observer's position (Figure 9.1).Figure 9.1. Subpoint of a Star.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20012179.3. Intercept. Assume yourself to be at a given point (called the assumed position). At a given time,there exists at that instant a specific relationship between your assumed position and the subpoint. Thevarious navigational tables provide  you with this relationship  by  solving  the  astronomical  triangle  foryou. From the navigational tables, you can determine how far away your assumed position is from thesubpoint and the Zn of the subpoint from the assumed position. This means, in effect, that the tables giveyou a value called computed altitude (Hc) which would be the correct observed altitude (Ho) if you wereanywhere on the circle of equal altitude through the assumed position. Any difference between the Hcdetermined for the assumed position and the Ho as determined by the sextant for the actual position iscalled intercept. Intercept is the number of NM between your actual circle of equal altitude and the circleof equal altitude through the assumed position. It is by means of the astronomical triangle that you cansolve for Hc and Zn in the Pub. No. 249 tables.9.4. Construction of the Astronomical Triangle. Consider the solution of a star as it appears on thecelestial sphere. Start with the Greenwich meridian and the  equator. Projected on the celestial sphere,these become the celestial meridian and the celestial equator (called equinoctial) as shown in Figure 9.2.Notice also in the same illustration how other known information is derived, namely the LHA of the starAries—equal to the Greenwich hour angle (GHA) of Aries minus longitude west. You can also see thatif the LHA of Aries and sidereal hour angle (SHA) of the star are known, the LHA of the star is theirsum. It should also be evident that the GHA of Aries plus SHA of the star equals GHA of the star. Also,the GHA of the body minus west longitude (or plus east longitude) of the observer's zenith equals LHAof the body. These are important relationships used in the derivation of the Hc and Zn.Figure 9.2. Astronomical Triangle.218AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20019.4.1. Figure 9.3 shows part of the celestial sphere and the astronomical triangle. Notice that the knowninformation of the astronomical triangle is the two sides and the included angle; that is, Co-Dec, Co-Latand LHA of the star. Co-Dec, or polar distance, is the angular distance measured along the hour circle ofthe body from the elevated pole to the body. The side, Co-Lat, is 90o minus the latitude of the assumedposition. The included angle in this example is the LHA. With two sides and the included angle of thespherical triangle known, the third side and the interior angle at the observer are easily solved. The thirdside  is  the  zenith  distance,  and  the  interior  angle  at  the  observer  is  the  azimuth  angle  (Z).  Instead  oflisting the zenith distance, the astronomical tables list the remaining portion of the 90o from the zenith,or the Hc. Hc equals 90o minus zenith distance of the assumed position, just as zenith distance of theassumed  position  equals  90o  –  Hc.  Note  that  when  measured  with  reference  to  the  celestial  horizon,zenith distance is synonymous with co-altitude. Figure 9.4 is a side view of this solution.Figure 9.3. Celestial— Terrestial Relationship.9.4.2.  So  far,  the  astronomical  triangle  has  been  defined  only  on  the  celestial  sphere.  Refer  again  toFigure  9.3  and  notice  the  same  triangle  on  the  terrestrial  sphere  (earth).  The  same  triangle  with  itscorresponding vertices may be defined on the earth as follows: (1)  celestial pole—terrestrial pole;  (2)zenith  of  assumed  position—assumed  position;  and  (3)  star—-subpoint  of  the  star.  The  three  interiorangles of this  triangle  are  exactly  equal  to  the  angles  on  the  celestial  sphere.  The  angular  distance  ofeach of the three sides is exactly equal to the corresponding side on the astronomical triangle. Celestialand terrestrial terms are used interchangeably. For example, refer to Figure 9.3 and notice that Co-Lat onthe terrestrial triangle is also called Co-Lat on the celestial triangle. To be perfectly correct, the term onthe celestial sphere  corresponding  to  latitude  on  the  earth  is  declination  (Dec);  therefore,  the  celestialside could well be called co-declination of the zenith of the assumed position.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 9.4. Co-Altitude Equals 90 Minus Hc.2199.4.3.  Rather  than  have  this  confusion,  the  terrestrial  term  Co-Lat  is  also  used  with  reference  to  thecelestial sphere, just as latitude of the subpoint is considered to be the Dec amount from the  equator.Latitude is used when referring to the observer or zenith, and Dec is used when referring to the star or itssubpoint. The distance between the subpoint and the assumed position is generally referred to as zenithdistance  (Co-Alt)  rather  than  the  segment  of  the  vertical  circle  joining  the  subpoint  and  the  assumedposition. These angular distance terms are interchangeable on the celestial and terrestrial spheres.9.4.4. The values of the Zn and the interior angle (Z) are listed in the Pub. No. 249 tables dependingupon  whether  or  not  a  Dec  solution  is  desired.  Pub.  No.  249,  Volume  1,  lists  the  Zn  rather  than  theinterior angle. Pub. No. 249, Volumes 2 and 3, list the interior angle (Z). It is necessary to follow rulesprinted on each page to convert the interior angle (Z) to true azimuth (Zn).9.5. Pub. No. 249, Volume 1. This volume deals solely with the solution concerning selected stars andis considered separately from Volumes 2 and 3. Volume 1 provides complete worldwide coverage frompole to pole for each degree of latitude. The LHA of Aries is listed in 1o increments from latitudes of 0oto 69o North and South inclusive. From 70o through 89o of latitude, the meridians are so close togetherthat it is only necessary to tabulate the values of the LHA of Aries in even 2o increments. There are twopages devoted to each whole degree of latitude between latitudes 69o N and 69o S inclusive. From thereto  the  pole,  only  one  page  is  devoted  to  each  whole  degree  of  latitude.  The  three  stars  marked  bydiamonds  on  each  page  provide  sets  for  fixing  purposes,  which  are  favorably  situated  in  altitude  andazimuth.9.5.1. The entering arguments are the assumed latitude and the LHA of Aries (to whole degrees). At anyone time, the navigator has the choice of the seven listed stars for that latitude plus Polaris. The namesof the stars are in capital letters if the star is of first magnitude or brighter; the second magnitude starsare printed in small letters. The names of the stars are listed every 15o of LHA of Aries (every 30o in thepolar latitudes). For the time the navigator expects to make an observation, commonly called a shot, theylook up the GHA of Aries and apply the approximate longitude to get a whole degree LHA of Aries. The220AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001navigator  then  enters  Pub.  No.  249,  Volume  1,  with  the  latitude  closest  to  the  dead  reckoning  (DR)latitude and the LHA of Aries to select the stars that will be shot.9.5.2. Since single celestial observation results in only one LOP, it is necessary to shoot two or morebodies to obtain a fix. Suppose the  navigator  wants  to  shoot  at  approximately  0230  Greenwich  MeanTime (GMT), he or she looks up the GHA of Aries (in the Air Almanac) and finds it to be 196o. The DRposition  for  this  time  is  31o48'  N,  075o26'  W.  A  quick  calculation  shows  the  LHA  of  Aries  isapproximately 121o, and the closest latitude is 32o N. Notice in the portion of the tables reproduced inFigure 9.5 the available stars at this position are Alkaid, Regulus, Alphard, Sirius, Rigel, Aldebaran, andCapella. Using Sirius, a shot is taken at 0231 and the Ho obtained is 37o50'.GHA Aries for 0230 GMTCorrection for l minuteGHA Aries for 0231 GMTClosest longitude to DR for whole LHALHA Aries for 0231 GMT196o06'15'196o21'W075o21'121o(assumed longitude)Figure 9.5.

Theassumed longitude is selected as the closest point, resulting in an LHA of Aries that is a whole degree(no minutes). The Hc of Sirius is listed as 37o40'. The Zn is 205o.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20012219.5.4. The second shot was taken at 0234 using Regulus, the Ho being 55o30'. A new DR position couldbe obtained for 0234 GMT, but the 0230Z DR position will suffice for this determination of Hc and Zn.GHA Aries for 0230 GMTCorrection for 4 minutesGHA Aries for 0234ZClosest longitude for whole LHALHA Aries for 0234Z196o06'1o00'197o06'W075o06'122o(assumed longitude)9.5.5. The assumed latitude is still 32o N and, in this case, 075o06' W is the assumed longitude since thisis the closest longitude to the DR longitude that results in the LHA of Aries being a whole degree. TheHc of Regulus is listed as 56o19', and the Zn is 119o. The various corrections that must be applied aswell as the plotting of the fix are discussed later.9.6. Postcomputation Method. The steps in this procedure are as follows:9.6.1. Determine the GHA of Aries for the time of observation from the Air Almanac.9.6.2. Assume a position as close as possible to the DR position at the time of the shot so the latitude andLHA of Aries in whole degrees may be determined.9.6.3. Turn to the page in Pub. No. 249 for the assumed latitude and, opposite the LHA of Aries, selectthe stars to be shot. In making the selection, assume the LHA of Aries will change 1o every 4 minutes oftime.9.6.4. Shoot the body and record the time, Ho, and name of the body.9.6.5.  Obtain  the  GHA  of  Aries  for  the  time  of  the  observation,  and  apply  the  assumed  longitude  todetermine the LHA of Aries.9.6.6. Turn to the pages for the assumed latitude and, opposite the LHA of Aries in the column headedby the name of the star, find and record the Hc and Zn.9.7.  Pub.  No.  249,  Volumes  2  and  3.  Volume  1  consists  of  tables  of  Hc  and  Zn  for  selected  stars.Because the Dec and SHA of each star change slowly, these tables may be used  for many  years withonly  small  corrections.  The  Dec  and  SHA  of  a  nonstellar  body  change  rapidly,  making  a  permanentformat similar to Volume 1 impossible for the sun, moon, and planets.9.7.1. Volumes 2 and 3 have Dec tables adequate for determining the Hc and Zn of any celestial bodywithin the Dec range of 30o N to 30o S. They are intended primarily for use when observing nonstellar(solar system) bodies. Volume 2 provides latitudes between 39o N and 39o S, and Volume 3 provides forlatitudes from 40o N or S to the poles.9.7.2. Provision is made for observed altitudes from 90o above to 3o below the horizon (7o from latitudes70o to the pole). In view of refraction and of possible long intercepts, the tables are actually extended 2obelow these limits.222AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 20019.8.  Entering  Arguments.  Volumes  2  and  3  are  entered  with  the  LHA  of  the  body,  in  contrast  toVolume  1,  which  is  entered  with  the  LHA  of  Aries.  The  range  extends  from  0o  through  all  LHAsapplicable within the altitude limits of the body. Between latitude 70o and the pole, the LHA interval is2o; for latitudes below 70o, the interval is 1o. Arguments of LHA of the body less than 180o appear onthe left margin, and arguments greater than 180o appear on the right.9.8.1. Several pages are devoted to each degree of latitude. Each page has 15 declination columns and islabeled with its value at the top and bottom. Each page is also marked Declination Contrary Name toLatitude or Declination Same Name as Latitude.9.8.2. The entering arguments of LHA of the body, for declination of contrary name to latitude, alwaysincrease  from  the  bottom  of  the  page  on  the  left  side,  and  decrease  on  the  right.  The  oppositearrangement exists on pages where Dec and latitude has the same name. Occasionally, one page will beblank in the middle and the top half will cover Declination Same Name as Latitude, while the bottomhalf will be Declination Contrary Name to Latitude.9.8.3.  Azimuth  angle  (Z)  is  listed  instead  of  true  azimuth  (Zn).  Since  Zn  is  used  for  plotting,  it  isnecessary  to  convert  Z  to  Zn.  The  rules  for  conversion  are  listed  on  the  left-hand  side  at  the  top  andbottom of every page. Notice that LHA and Zn will never occur on the same side of 180o.9.8.4. In addition to Hc and Z, a value of d is also listed. This d-value is the change in altitude (Hc) witha 1o increase in Dec. If the LHA and Dec of the body and the latitude of the assumed position are each awhole number of degrees, the Hc and Z are found in the correct Dec column opposite the LHA of thebody on the page marked by the proper latitude value.9.8.5. For example, refer to the portion of the table shown in  Figure 9.6. At the latitude 40o  N, if theLHA of a body is 86o and its Dec is 5o N, the Hc is 06o16' and the azimuth angle (Z) is 089o. The rule inthe upper left-hand corner of the page applies for the conversion of Z to Zn. Zn = (360o – Z) or (360o –089o) = 271o. Here again the position is assumed so that latitude and LHA are whole numbers.9.9. Interpolation for Declination (Dec). When the Dec of a body is a number of minutes in addition toa whole number of degrees, the altitude (Hc) is extracted for the whole number of degrees and correctedby interpolation for the additional minutes. There is rarely a need for interpolation of Z, which is givenonly to the nearest degree.9.9.1. Interpolation for Hc should always be made in the direction of increasing Dec in accordance withthe sign of the d-value. Not all of the signs are printed; the sign is given at least once in each block offive entries, and can always be found by looking either up or down the column from the value of d inquestion. The correction to altitude for additional minutes of Dec is proportional to d and proportional tothe number of additional minutes.9.9.2. In the previous example, the latitude was 40o , the LHA of the body was 086o, and the Dec was 5oN. Suppose the Dec had been 5o17' N. The basic figures obtained would be 06o16' Hc and 089o Z  asbefore, and the true azimuth (Zn) would still be 271o. The Hc of 06o16' is not correct for a Dec of 5o17'N, but is correct for 5o N. The Hc change for an additional 1o of Dec (d-value) is +39 minutes of altitude.However, the correction needed in this case is for 17 minutes of Dec, not a whole degree. Consequently,the additional correction  is  17/60  of  39'.  To  the  closest  whole  number,  this  would  be  +11  minutes  ofaltitude.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001223Figure 9.6. Enter Tables With Latitude, Declination, and LHA.9.9.3. This multiplication can be done on the slide rule face of the DR computer or by means of a tablefound in back of Pub. No. 249, Volumes 2 and 3. A portion of this table is shown in Figure 9.7. Noticethat there are no signs listed. The proper sign for the answer from this table is the same sign as the basicd-value. A rule of thumb is the correction will be a plus (+) for declination of same name as latitude anda negative (-) for declination of contrary name as latitude. Values of d are given across the top of thetable, and additional minutes of Dec are given down the side of the table. In the table, the correction 11'is found by looking across 17' for Dec and down 39' for d to their intersection at 11'. Since the sign ofthe  d-value  is  plus,  this  correction  is  added  to  the  tabulated  Hc.  The  correct  Hc  value  then  becomes06o16' + 11' or 06o27'.9.9.4. Following is a sample problem illustrating the solution. Refer to the portion of the tables in Figure9.8 for the solution. Suppose the sun is observed at 1005 GMT. The DR position is 38o12' N, 101o47' E,and the Ho of the sun is 10o52'.224AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Dec of the Sun for 1000ZGHA Sun for 1000ZCorrection to GHA for 5 minutesGHA Sun for l005ZClosest longitude for whole degree LHALHA Sun for 1005ZFigure 9.7.

The  closest  whole  degree  of  latitude  is  38o  N  and  is  used  as  the  assumed  latitude.  Since  theassumed latitude is north and Dec is south, the navigator must use Pub. 249, Volume 2, page  for 38olatitude which is headed Declination (0o–14o) Contrary Name to Latitude. Following LHA 070o acrossthe page to 7o Dec, the navigator extracts:AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001225Tab Hcd-valueZd-correction from Pub.

Shoot the body and record the time of observation, the body's name, and the Ho.9.10.2. From the Air Almanac, extract GHA and Dec of the body for the time of the observation.9.10.3. Assume a position close to the DR position so that the latitude is a whole number of degrees andthe  longitude  combined  with  the  GHA  of  the  body  gives  a  whole  number  of  degrees  of  LHA  of  thebody. Find the LHA of the body for this position.9.10.4. Select the correct volume (2 or 3) and page that contains the correct arguments of Dec and LHAof the body, temporarily disregarding the odd additional minutes of Dec. Thus, if the Dec were N19o55',use the column for 19o. Select the table labeled Declination Same Name as Latitude, if Dec and latitudeare both north or both south, or select the table labeled Declination Contrary Name to Latitude, if one isnorth and the other south. Opposite the LHA of the body, read the tabulated altitude, d-value, and Zn inthe column headed by the whole degrees of Dec.9.10.5. If the Dec is not a whole number of degrees, determine the correction for the additional minutesof  Dec.  Enter  the  table  in  the  Pub.  No.  249  volume  with  the  value  d  and  the  number  of  additionalminutes of Dec. Apply the correction to the tabulated altitude (Hc) according to the sign of d. This is thecorrected Hc.9.10.6. Convert azimuth angle (Z) to true azimuth (Zn) by means of the rule at the top or bottom of thepage.9.10.7. This completes the solution for the Dec tables. Keep in mind this solution is computed after theobservation.  Because  of  the  speeds  involved  in  air  navigation,  we  will  explain  a  way  to  compute  thesolution before the shot in the next chapter.Section 9C— Precession and Nutation9.11. Basics. The earth's axis does not maintain a fixed direction in space. Actually, the earth is like aslow running gyro that is wobbling. There are several separate patterns that the wobble makes. Some ofthose  patterns  have  short  cycles,  while  others  take  hundreds  of  years  to  complete.  Two  of  the  manypatterns  are  shown  in  Figure  9.9.  One  involves  small  nodding  motions  while  at  the  same  timecompleting a larger circular path. You must use a correction called precession and nutation to accountfor these variations in the apparent position of the stars. This correction is applied only to celestial LOPsdetermined with Pub. No. 249, Volume 1.226AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 9.9. Earth's Axis Wobble.9.12.  Precession.  Because  of  the  equatorial  bulge,  the  attractive  forces  of  other  solar  system  bodies,principally  the  moon,  are  unbalanced  about  the  center  of  the  earth.  The  imbalance  is  directed  towardaligning  the  equator  with  the  plane  of  the  ecliptic.  However,  the  rotation  of  the  earth  transforms  thisforce into an effect acting 90o away in the direction of rotation—a precessional effect. The result is thatthe poles travel in a conical path westward around the ecliptic poles, as shown in Figure 9.10 (the point90o from the ecliptic). Consequently, the points of intersection of the equator  with the ecliptic, or  theequinoxes,  travel  in  a  westerly  direction  along  the  ecliptic.  This  travel  is  called  precession  of  theequinoxes,  and  it  amounts  to  approximately  five-sixths  (5/6)  of  a  minute  (50.26")  annually.  Theequinoxes complete one revolution along the ecliptic in approximately 25,800 years. The equator is usedas a reference for Dec and its movement, due to precession of the equinoxes, causes slight changes in thecelestial coordinates of the stars, which otherwise appear fixed in space.9.13. Nutation. As the relative positions and distances from the earth to the sun, moon, and planets varyso does the rate of precession. The only variation of importance in navigation is nutation. Nutation is anodding of the poles, one oscillation occurring in about 18.6 years.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 9.10. Precession of the Equinoxes.2279.13.1. In Figure 9.11, you can see that if the stars remain fixed and the equinoctial moves up and down,the Dec of these bodies is changing.9.13.2. Nutation, being approximately perpendicular to the ecliptic, has an appreciable influence on Dec.It is caused by complex gravitational forces among the sun, moon, and earth because the moon's orbitdoes not always lie in the plane of the ecliptic. The change in Dec of the celestial bodies caused by theresulting wobble of the earth's axis is called nutation.9.14. Position Corrections. Because of precession and nutation, Hc and Zn for a star are accurate onlyat the instant, or epoch, at which the LHA and Dec for the computations are correct. A position obtainedat any other time with that Hc and Zn requires a correction. Pub. No. 249, Volume 1, contains Hcs andZns calculated for an epoch year (midnight, 1 January, of that year) so, if the volume is used in any otheryear, the resultant position must be corrected. The precession and nutation corrections are combined andgiven in Pub. No. 249, Volume 1, Table 5.9.14.1.  Entering  arguments  for  the  table  is  year,  latitude,  and  LHA  of  Aries,  and  the  correction  ispresented  in  the  form  of  a  distance  and  direction  to  move  the  fix.  The  tabulated  values  show  thedistance, parallel to the ecliptic, between the observer's position in the year of the fix and the position inthe epoch year at the latitude and LHA of Aries.228AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 9.11.

This  chapter  has  dealt  with  the  astronomical  triangle  and  how  the  Pub.  No.  249volumes you use in resolving the astronomical triangle. We've discussed obtaining solutions involvingcelestial bodies using Pub. No. 249, Volumes 1, 2, and 3. Succeeding chapters will discuss plotting ofthe celestial LOPs and techniques of precomputation.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001229Chapter 10CELESTIAL PRECOMPUTATIONSection 10A— Introduction10.1.  Basics.  Celestial  precomputation  is  neither  new  nor  revolutionary.  The  tables  necessary  to  doprecomputation  have  been  available  since  1940;  however,  there  was  no  operational  requirement  forprecomputation  at  that  time.  With  present  day  high-speed  aircraft,  however,  the  picture  has  changedradically. By "postcomping," a great deal of work must be done after the last celestial observation. Thefix could easily be 15 minutes old by the time it is plotted on the chart. At 450 knots groundspeed (GS),a fix that is 15 minutes old is over 100 miles behind the aircraft and is of questionable value. Anotherfactor necessitating precomputation in high-speed aircraft lies in the method of shooting celestial. Withthe limited field of view of the sextant, the correct star is difficult to find unless you know where to look.10.2. Presetting the Sextant. Precomputation greatly reduces both of the problems just mentioned. Bycompleting most of the computations before shooting, the navigator reduces the time necessary to plotthe  fix  after  the  last  observation.  Also,  the  problem  of  finding  the  star  in  the  optics  of  the  sextant  issimplified.  The  procedure  for  finding  the  star  is  similar  to  the  heading  check  performed  with  theperiscopic sextant, using the true bearing (TB) method as explained in Chapter 12. In this case the trueazimuth (Zn) is set into the sextant mount and the computed altitude (Hc), which will approximate thesextant  altitude  (Hs),  is  set  into  the  sextant.  Now,  instead  of  sighting  the  body  to  determine  the  trueheading (TH), set the TH under the vertical crosshair to find the selected body, hopefully very close tothe  crosshairs  in  the  sextant  field  of  view.  Use  the  inverse  relative  bearing  (IRB)  method  to  avoiderroneous settings in the azimuth window and to increase speed in setting up the sextant. In this method,the azimuth window remains permanently at 000.0o and the IRB is computed by the formula: IRB = TH– Zn. The body should be found at its computed altitude when its IRB appears under the crosshairs.Section 10B— Precomputation Techniques10.3. Basics. There are many acceptable methods of precomputation in general usage. However, thesemethods  are  basically  either  graphical,  mathematical,  or  a  combination  of  both  methods.  Selection  islargely based on individual navigator preference and assigned command.10.3.1. Celestial corrections which are used in precomputation include atmospheric refraction, parallaxof  the  moon,  instrument  and  acceleration  errors,  Coriolis  and  rhumb  line,  precession  and  nutation,motion  of  the  observer,  and  wander.  With  precomputation,  new  corrections  and  terminology  areintroduced, which include fix time, solution time, observation time, scheduled time, and motion of thebody adjustment.10.3.2. Fix time is the time for which the LOPs are resolved and plotted on the chart. Solution time is thetime  for  which  the  astronomical  triangle  is  solved.  Observation  time  is  the  midtime  of  the  actualobservation for  each  celestial body. Scheduled time  is  the  time  for  which  the  astronomical  triangle  issolved  for  each  LOP  in  the  graphic  method.  Motion  of  the  body  correction  is  used  to  correct  for  thechanging altitude of the selected bodies from shot to fix time and may be applied either graphically ormathematically.230AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200110.4.  Motion  of  the  Body  Correction.  Motion  of  the  body  correction  can  be  applied  graphically  bymoving the assumed  position  eastward  or  westward  for  time.  This  is  possible  because  the  Greenwichhour  angle  (GHA)  and  the  subpoint  of  the  body  move  westward  at  the  rate  of  1o  of  longitude  per  4minutes  of  time.  In  the  graphic  method,  a  scheduled  time  of  observation  is  given  to  each  body.  Ifshooting is off schedule, the following rules apply: For every minute of time that the shot is taken early,move the assumed position 15' of longitude to the east; for every minute of time that the shot is takenlate, move the assumed position 15' of longitude to the west.10.4.1. When the latitude of the assumed position and the Zn of the body are known, the motion of thebody can be computed mathematically. For 1 minute, the formula is: 15(cos lat)/(sin Zn). This correctionis shown in tabular form in Figure 10.1. In Pub. No. 249, the local hour angle (LHA) increases 1o in 4minutes of time. Thus, the Hc for an LHA that is 1o less than the LHA used for precomputation is the Hcfor 4 minutes of time earlier than the solution time. The difference between the two Hcs is the value toapply to the Hc or Hs to advance or retard the line of position (LOP) for 4 minutes of time. If the Hcdecreases (Zn greater than 180o), the body is setting  and the sign is minus to advance the  LOP if thevalue is applied to the Hs. If the Hc increases (Zn less than 180o), the body is rising and the sign is plusto advance the LOP if the value is applied to the Hs.10.4.2.  In  addition, motion corrections may be determined by using a modified MB-4 computer. Thismodification allows for greater accuracy and speed in computation of combined motions (motion of theobserver and motion of the body) than the Pub. No. 249 tables. For a discussion of this modification, seeChapter 12.10.5. Special Celestial Techniques. The main difference between the basic methods of precomputationis the manner in which the motion of the observer and the motion of the body corrections are applied. Inthe graphic method, both corrections are applied graphically by movement of the assumed position orthe LOP. In the mathematical method, both corrections are applied mathematically to the Hc, the Hs, orthe intercept after being obtained from tables, a modified MB-4 computer, or the Pub. No. 249.10.6. Celestial Computation Sheets. The format in Figure 10.2 is a typical celestial precomputation andillustrates one acceptable method of completing a precomputation. The explanation is numbered to helplocate  the  various  blocks  on  the  celestial  sheets  (Figure  10.2).  NOTE:  Not  all  blocks  apply  on  everyprecomputation.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 10.1. Correction for Motion of the Body.231232AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 10.2.

In  some  methods  of  precomputation,  corrections  are  applied  inadvance to the Hc to derive an adjusted Hc. When using corrections that are normally applied to Hs, thesigns of the corrections are reversed if applied to Hc. For example:Corrections Applied to Hs31o 05HsREFR-01-05PERS/SEXT30o 59Ho30o 40HcINT19TCorrections Applied to HcHcREFRPERS/SEXTADJ HcHsINT30o 40+01+0530o 4631o 0519T10.7.1. This example demonstrates that corrections may be applied to either Hs or Hc. As long as theyare applied with the proper sign, the intercept remains the same. The following sample precomp uses acommon fix time (though computation times are different) and common observation times to facilitatecomparison. NOTE: Atmospheric refraction correction must be extracted for the actual Hs. It may thenbe applied to either Hc or Hs using the proper sign. Extracting the value for Hc may cause large errors,especially when the body is near the horizon. Figure 10.3 is a sample three-star precomputation usingthe mathematical format. Corrections to altitude of the body are applied to the Hc and the sign of thecorrection has been reversed in this process, so the fix can be plotted prior to the computation time. Allshots are early shots, allowing the navigator to resolve the fix and alter at fix time. However, any minorerrors in interpolation for motions are multiplied for the two earliest shots and may cause inaccuracies inthe fix.10.7.2.  Figure  10.4  shows  a  three-star  precomputation  using  a  three-LHA  or  graphical  solution.  Theassumed position will then be moved for track and groundspeed to accommodate LOPs shot off time.Each  observation  is  taken  on  time  and  then  plotted  out  of  its  own  plotting  position.  This  precomp  iseasier  and  faster  to  accomplish  with  relatively  few  opportunities  for  math  errors  to  occur.  The  threeassumed  positions  required  for  this  solution,  on  the  other  hand,  often  cause  large  intercepts  and  maymake star identification difficult if care is not taken in choosing the precomp assumed position.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 10.3. Mathematical Solution.235236AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 10.4. Graphical Solution.10.8. Limitations. Precomputational methods lose accuracy when the assumed position and the actualposition differ by large distances. Another limiting factor is the difference in time between the scheduledand actual observation time. The motion of the body correction is intended to correct for this difference.The rate of change of the correction for motion of the body changes very slowly within 40o of 090o and270o Zn and the observation may be advanced or retarded for a limited period of time with little or noerror. When the body is near the observer's meridian, however, the  correction for motion of the bodyAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001237changes rapidly due in part to the fast azimuth change and it's inadvisable to adjust such observations forlong (over 6 minutes) periods of time. NOTE: Errors in altitude and azimuth creep into the solution ifadjustments  are  made  for  too  long  an  interval  of  time.  Because  of  these  errors,  the  navigator  shouldattempt to keep observation time as close as possible to computation time.Section 10C— Preplotting True Azimuth (Zn)10.9. Basics. To speed up fix resolution, some navigators preplot the Zns of the bodies. This techniqueworks best when used on a constant scale chart and using a technique of precomputation that will giveone assumed position. Before making any observations, plot the assumed position, correct it for Coriolisand  precession  and/or  nutation  (if  required)  and  draw  the  Zns  of  the  bodies  through  this  point.  Labeleach Zn as the 1st, 2d, or 3d as shown in Figure 10.5, or use the name of the bodies. Use arrowheads toidentify the direction of the body. Suppose the corrected assumed position is 30o40' N, 117o10' W andthe following Zns were computed for the bodies:1st shot Zn 020o2d shot Zn 135o3d shot Zn 270oThe original assumed position of 31o N; 117o08' W has been corrected for precession and/or nutation andfor Coriolis or rhumb line error to obtain the plotting position. When the first intercept is found to be10A, second intercept 40A, and the third intercept 50T, the fix may be plotted quickly by constructingperpendicular lines at the correct point on the respective Zn line. This greatly reduces the time necessaryto plot the fix.10.10.  Summary.  Celestial  precomputation  methods  have  been  brought  to  the  forefront  with  theproliferation  of  high-speed  aircraft.  Aircraft  speeds  make  it  necessary  to  minimize  the  time  betweenshooting and fixing. Since the sextant may be the only  means  of  viewing  the  body,  it  is  necessary  toprecompute  the  altitude  and  azimuth  of  a  body  in  order  to  locate  it.  Remember  corrections  may  beapplied to the Hc, Ho, or intercept, and pay close attention to the sign of the correction. In addition toprecomputation, the fix may be resolved faster by preplotting the true azimuths of the bodies.238AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 10.5. Fix Can Be Plotted Quickly.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001239PLOTTING AND INTERPRETING THE CELESTIAL LINE OF POSITIONChapter 11Section 11A— Introduction11.1. Basics. This chapter explains the  methods  that  transform  the  tabulated  and  in-flight  observationvalues into an aircraft position. The navigator is faced with two tasks: plotting the resultant informationonto  a  chart  and  resolving  this  information  into  an  aircraft  position.  There  are  two  basic  methods  ofobtaining a line of position (LOP): the subpoint method and the intercept method.11.2. Subpoint Method (Figure 11.1). A detailed explanation of the theory concerning this method is inChapters 9 and 10.Figure 11.1. The Subpoint Method.11.2.1. Here is a summary of the steps involved:11.2.1.1. Positively identify the body and measure the altitude using a sextant.11.2.1.2.  Because  no  tabulated  information  for  azimuth  or  elevation  is  required  for  this  method,corrections  for  refraction,  parallax,  semidiameter,  wander  error,  and  sextant  correction  are  applieddirectly to the Ho.11.2.1.3. The resultant measurement is subtracted from 90o to obtain the co-altitude (co-alt). To convertto NM (1o=60 NM), multiply the number of degrees times 60. Any fractional portion of degrees is addedto the previous value.11.2.2. Example: Vega is observed at an altitude (Ho) of 88o23'. Sextant correction is -03'.88o23' – 03' = 88o20'90o – 88o20' = 1o40'1o 40' = 60' + 40' = 100 NM240AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200111.2.3. In this example, 100 NM represents the distance from the observer's position to the subpoint ofthe body. The coordinates of the body are its corresponding declination (Dec) and Greenwich hour angle(GHA). For this example, Vega's Dec is N38o46'. The GHA is obtained by applying the sidereal hourangle (SHA) of Vega to the GHA of Aries.EXAMPLE:SHA = 080o59'GHA Aries = 039o18'GHA Vega = 120o17'11.2.4.  Subpoint  of  Vega  is  located  at  38o46'  N  l20o17'  W.  The  observer  is  now  ready  to  apply  theinformation:11.2.4.1. Plot the subpoint on an appropriate chart.11.2.4.2. With dividers or compass, span the co-alt distance; in this case 100 NM.11.2.4.3. Use the body's subpoint (38o46' N l20o17' W) as the center and 100 NM (co-alt) as the radius.The circle is called the circle of equal altitude and the observer is located on that portion of the circlenearest the DR position. There are definite advantages to this method. It requires no precomp values andplotting is very simple if the observer and body are reasonably close together. When the observer andbody are separated by great distances, some disadvantages appear.11.2.5. If a body is observed at 20o above the horizon, the observer is 4,200 NM from its subpoint. Toswing a LOP from this subpoint, the subpoint and the arc must be plotted on the same chart. To permitplotting of any LOP, the chart must cover an area extending more than 4,000 miles in every directionfrom the DR position. This means that the chart must be either of such large size that it cannot be spreadout on a table in the aircraft, or of such small scale that plotting on it is inaccurate. To cover an  area8,000 miles across, a chart 4 feet square must be drawn to a scale of about 1:10,000,000. Furthermore,measuring would be difficult because of distortion.11.2.6.  Since  a  celestial  LOP  cannot  always  be  drawn  by  the  subpoint  method,  the  intercept  method,based on the same principles, is often used.11.3. Intercept Technique:11.3.1. Intercept Method (Figure 11.2). You can eliminate the need for plotting the body's subpointand still draw the arc representing the circle of equal altitude. By using the following formula, you cancalculate the altitude and azimuth of the body for the DR position:Hc = SIN-1 [SIN (DEC') SIN (LDr)+COS (DEC')COS (LDr) COS (LHA)]Z = COS (Z) = [SIN (DEC')– SIN (LDR) SIN (HC)]/[COS (Hc COS (LDr)]Zn = Z if SIN (LHA) < 0Zn = 360 – Z if SIN (LHA) > 0AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001241Figure 11.2. Line of Position Computed by Intercept Method.11.3.2. The calculations may be performed quickly, using a programmable  calculator, or they may beextracted from the appropriate volume of Pub. No. 249. This method enables the observer to use any ofthe navigational bodies available at the appropriate fix time. Here is a brief review:11.3.2.1. Compute a DR for the time of the position, using preflight or in-flight data.11.3.2.2. Determine the necessary entering values for the Pub. 249 volume being used (Lat, LHA, Deccontrary or same) and extract all the necessary values of computed altitude (Hc), azimuth angle (Z), etc.11.3.2.3. After making all the necessary conversions and corrections (Chapter 10), compare the Ho andcorrected Hc. This difference is the intercept. If the Ho equals the corrected Hc, then the circle of equalaltitude passed through the plotting position. If the Ho is greater than the Hc, the difference is plotted inthe direction of the true azimuth (Zn). The Zn represents the azimuth from the observer's position to thesubpoint. If the Ho is less than the Hc, plot the difference 180o from the Zn.NOTE: If HO is MOre, plot TOward the subpoint ( HO MO TO )11.3.2.4. Example: The assumed position is 38o N, 121o30' W for a shot taken at 1015Z on Aldebaran.The  Ho  is  32o14'.  The  Hc  is  determined  to  be  32o29'  and  the  Zn  120o.  A  comparison  of  Ho  and  Hcdetermines the intercept to be 15 NM away (15A).11.4. Plotting LOP Using Zn Method (Figure 11.3):11.4.1. Plot the assumed position and set the intercept distance on the dividers.11.4.2. Draw a dashed line through the assumed position toward the subpoint.11.4.3. Span intercept distance along dashed Zn line.11.4.4. Place plotter perpendicular to Zn.242AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 11.3. Celestial Line of Position Using True Azimuth Method.11.4.5. Draw LOP along plotter as shown.11.5. Plotting LOP Using Flip-Flop Method (Figure 11.4):11.5.1. Plot the assumed position and set the intercept distance on the dividers.11.5.2. Measure 120o of the Zn with point A of the dividers on the assumed position and place point Bof the dividers down, in this case, away from 120o or in the direction of 300o from the assumed position.Slide  the  plotter  along  the  dividers  until  the  center  grommet  and  the  100/200-mile  mark  are  lined  updirectly over point B of the dividers marking the intercept point.11.5.3. Remove point A of the dividers from the assumed position, keeping point B in place. Flip pointA (that was on the assumed position) across the plotter, at the same time expanding the dividers so thatpoint A can be placed on the chart at the 90o/270o mark of the plotter.11.5.4. Flop the plotter around and place the straight edge against the perpendicular, which is establishedby the dividers.11.5.5. Draw LOP along the plotter as shown.11.6. Summary of Intercept Method. When using the intercept method, remember:11.6.1. For some assumed position near the DR position, find the Hc and Zn of this body for the time ofthe observation. This is done with the aid of celestial tables, such as Pub. No. 249, or a programmablecalculator.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001243Figure 11.4. Plotting Celestial Line of Position Using Flip-Flop Method.244AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200111.6.2.  Obtain  needed  corrections,  sextant  correction,  refraction,  etc.,  and  apply  these  to  the  Hc  byreversing the sign (remember, we are striving to derive a precomputed value to ensure the correct bodyis shot). Measure the altitude (Ho) of the celestial body with the sextant and record the midtime of theobservation.11.6.3. Find the intercept, which is the difference between Ho and Hc. Intercept is toward the subpoint ifHo is greater than Hc and away from the subpoint if Ho is smaller than Hc.11.6.4.  From  the  assumed  position,  measure  the  intercept  toward  or  away  from  the  subpoint  (in  thedirection  of  Zn  or  its  reciprocal)  and  locate  a  point  on  the  LOP.  Through  this  point,  draw  the  LOPperpendicular to the Zn.11.7. Additional Plotting Techniques. The preceding techniques involve the basic plotting proceduresused on most stars and the bodies of the solar system. However, there are certain techniques of plottingthat  are  peculiar  to  their  own  celestial  methods;  for  example,  the  plotting  of  LOPs  obtained  by  usingPolaris, which is discussed later. Also, certain precomputation techniques lend themselves more readilyto  other  plotting  techniques,  such  as  preplotting  the  true  azimuths  or  plotting  the  fix  on  the  DRcomputer.11.7.1. These last plotting techniques are discussed in Pub. No. 249 in the section on precomputation.11.7.2. Other special techniques are discussed in the section on curves, in which the celestial observationis plotted on a graph rather than on the chart.Section 11B— Interpretation of an LOP11.8. Basics. Navigation has two aspects— the mechanical and the interpretive. The mechanical  aspectincludes  operation  and  reading  of  instruments,  simple  arithmetical  calculations,  plotting,  and  logkeeping. The interpretive aspect is the analysis of the data that have been gathered mechanically. Thesedata are variable and subject to error. You must convert them into probabilities as to the position, track,and GS of the aircraft and the direction and speed of the wind. The more these data are subject to error,the more careful the interpretations must be and the less mechanical the work can be. LOPs and fixesespecially  require  careful  interpretation.  It  is  convenient  to  think  of  a  fix  as  the  true  position  of  theaircraft and of the LOP as a line passing through this position, but these definitions are optimistic. It isalmost impossible to make a perfect observation and plot a perfect LOP. Therefore, an LOP passes someplace near this position, but not necessarily through it and a fix determined by the intersection of LOPsis simply the best estimate of this position on the basis of one set of observations. Thus, in reality, a fixis a most probable position (MPP) and a LOP is a line of MPP.11.8.1. The best interpretation of LOPs and fixes means they are used, to the best advantage, with DR.But good interpretation cannot compensate for poor LOPs, nor can good LOPs compensate for carelessDR. To get good results, every precaution must be taken to ensure the accuracy of LOPs and exact DRcalculations.11.8.2.  Intelligent  interpretation  requires  fine  judgment,  which  can  only  be  acquired  from  experience.You can be guided, however, by certain well-established, though flexible, rules.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200124511.8.3. The following discussion pertains especially to celestial LOPs and fixes. It also applies to LOPsand fixes established by radio and, to some extent, to those obtained by map reading.11.9. Single LOP. Previous discussions dealt with the basic plotting of an LOP and errors in LOPs, butthey did not show the actual mechanics of the plotted corrections which must be applied. The LOP mustbe corrected for Coriolis or rhumb line correction and also for precession and/or nutation correction if itis based on a Volume 1 star shot. Coriolis or rhumb line correction becomes a very significant correctionat  higher  speeds  and  latitudes.  For  example,  suppose  the  correction  determined  from  the  Coriolis  orrhumb line correction table is 9 NM right (of the track). The LOP must be moved a distance of 9 NM tothe  right  of  track.  This  can  be  done  either  by  moving  the  assumed  position  prior  to  plotting,  or  bymoving the LOP itself after it is plotted. (Remember the assumed position is not used in the plotting ofthe LOP obtained from a Polaris observation.) Consider Figure 11.5, which shows a track of 90o.Figure 11.5. Two Methods of Coriolis/Rhumb Line Correction.11.9.1. Notice that, in both methods, the corrected LOP is in the same place with respect to the originalassumed position and that the intercept value is the same. The resultant LOP is the same regardless ofthe method used.11.9.2. If, in addition to the Coriolis or rhumb line correction, a precession and/or nutation correction of3 NM in the direction of 60o is required, it would have been further applied as shown in Figure 11.6.Again, the corrected LOP is the same, using either method, because the intercept and resultant positionof the corrected LOP to the original assumed position are the same. The corrected LOP alone gives verylittle  information;  hence,  a  position  must  be  arrived  at  only  after  considering  the  LOP  and  the  DRposition for the same time.246AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 11.6. Two Methods of Coriolis/Rhumb Line and Precession/Nutation Correction.11.10. Most Probable Position (MPP) by C-Plot. The MPP is just what the name implies. It is not afix; however, since it is the best information available, it is treated as such. Notice in A of Figure 11.7that the DR position and celestial LOP (for the same time) do not coincide.Figure 11.7. Most Probable Position by C-Plot.11.10.1. Obviously, the DR information or celestial information, or both is in error. Notice that the priorfix has no time on it. Suppose this prior fix had been for the time of 1010. It would then be very likelythat most of the error is in the celestial information and the probable position is closer to the DR positionthan to the celestial LOP. On the other hand, suppose the prior fix had been for the time of 0900. Sincethe accuracy of the celestial information is unaffected by the time from the last fix, it would, in this case,be most likely that the actual position is closer to the LOP than to the DR position.11.10.2.  A  formula  has  been  devised  to  position  the  observer  along  the  perpendicular  to  the  LOPaccording to the time factor. The formula is:AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001247where t is time in minutes, p is the perpendicular distance between the DR position and the LOP and d isthe distance from the DR position for the time of the MPP measured along the perpendicular to the LOP.Look at B and C of Figure 11.7 and see how the formula works for the two problems cited above if theperpendicular is 20 NM in length.  In B of Figure  11.7,  t  is  15  minutes  and  p  is  20  NM,  so  the  MPPwould be located along the perpendicular about 8½ NM from the DR position.11.10.3. Now, consider C in Figure 11.7 where t is 1 hour 25 minutes or 85 minutes, p is 20 NM and inthis  case,  the  MPP  would  be  over  16  NM  away  from  the  DR  position  along  the  perpendicular  to  theLOP.11.10.4. If you prefer not to use the formula, a simple table can be easily constructed to solve for d withentering  arguments  of  t  and  p  as  shown  in  Figure  11.8.  The  table  could  easily  be  enlarged  to  handlelarger values of t and p. In most fixes, the DR position is so close to the LOP that the midpoint betweenthese two can be considered the MPP. A good rule to use is to take the midpoint of the perpendicular ifthe total distance between the DR position and the LOP is 10 NM or less. If the value of p is greater than10 NM, use a table or the formula to determine the MPP. Up to this point, determination of the MPP hasbeen rather mechanical. Experienced navigators will frequently further adjust the position of the MPPfor other factors not yet considered. For example, if the LOP is carefully obtained under good conditionsor if it is the average of several LOPs, you may further weight the MPP in the direction of the LOP byan  amount  that  judgment  dictates.  However,  the  reverse  may  be  true  if  the  LOP  is  obtained  underadverse conditions of rough air. In the latter case, you might move the MPP closer to the DR position bysome amount determined by sound judgment.Figure 11.8. To Solve for Distance.248AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200111.10.5. Further, consider the validity of the DR position in relation to factors other than time. A  DRposition at the end of 40 minutes would be more reliable with Doppler drift and GS versus one based onmetro information. These factors may also adjust the original MPP closer to or farther away from theDR position, along the perpendicular. However, these last mentioned factors are judgment values thatcome only with experience. In fact, with experience you may mentally calculate all the factors involvedand arrive at the final position of the MPP without recourse to a formula or table.11.11. Finding a Celestial Fix Point. Up to this point, only the single celestial LOP and what to do withit  have  been  considered.  Now,  the  celestial  fix  should  be  considered.  To  establish  a  fix,  two  or  moreLOPs  must  be  obtained.  Since,  in  most  cases,  two  or  more  LOPs  cannot  be  obtained  simultaneously,they must be converted to a common time. For example, a LOP obtained at 1010 must be converted tothe LOP obtained at the fix time of 1014. There are several methods for making this conversion, whichare  discussed  in  this  chapter.  Consideration  is  also  given  to  the  planning  of  the  fix  and  the  finalinterpretation of the fix itself.Section 11C— Conversion of LOPs To A Common Time11.12. Moving the LOP. One method of converting LOPs to a common time is to move the LOP alongthe best-known track for the number of minutes of GS necessary for the time conversions. This methodis similar to that used for correcting for Coriolis or rhumb line and precession or nutation. For example,suppose the track is 110o and the GS 300 knots. LOPs are for 1500, 1504, and 1508 and a fix is desiredat 1508. This means the 1500 LOP must be moved to the time of the fix, using the track and 8 minutesof  the  best  known  GS.  The  1504  LOP  must  be  moved  to  the  time  of  the  fix,  using  the  track  and  4minutes of GS. The 1508 LOP is already at the fix time, so it requires no movement. Figure 11.9 showsthe method of conversion as it is completed on the chart.Figure 11.9. Conversion of Lines of Position to a Common Time.11.12.1. If, at any time, the LOP has to be retarded (moved back) to the time of the fix, use the followingprocedures.  Using  the  reciprocal  track  and  GS,  obtain  the  correction  in  the  regular  manner  for  thenumber of minutes of difference. For example, suppose the fix is at 1800 and the last shot is at 1802.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200124911.12.2.  Retarding  the  LOP  2  minutes  of  GS  on  a  track  of  70o  would  be  the  same  as  advancing  it  2minutes of GS on a track of 250o.11.13. Motion of Observer Tables. A second method of conversion of LOPs to a common time is witha  Motion  of  the  Observer  table  such  as  the  one  in  Pub.  No.  249.  This  table  gives  a  correction  to  beapplied to the Ho or Hc so that the LOP plots in its converted position. The correction obtained fromTable 1 in all volumes of Pub. No. 249 is for 4 minutes of time. An additional table allows you to get thecorrection for the number of minutes needed.11.13.1. For example, suppose the LOP needs to be advanced for 11 minutes and the Ho of the body is33o 29' and Zn is 080o. The track of the aircraft is 020o and the GS is 240 knots. In Table 1, Correctionfor Motion of the Observer for 4 minutes of Time (Figure 11.10), the entering arguments is Rel Zn andGS. Rel Zn is azimuth relative to course (Zn minus track or track minus Zn). Subtract the smaller anglefrom the larger and enter the table with the answer. In this case, Zn – track = 080o – 020o = 060o (RelZn)  and  GS  is  240  knots.  Entering  this  table  with  these  arguments,  the  correction  listed  is  +08'  for  4minutes of time.11.13.2.  Use  the  whiz  wheel  to  calculate  the  total  motion  for  11  minutes.  In  this  case,  the  11-minutecorrection totals 22'. By applying any other correction (refraction, sextant correction), a total adjustmentis derived. By changing the sign, this total may be applied to the Hc. To apply the correction to the Ho,the sign of  the  adjustment  would  remain  the  same.  Apply  the  adjustment  to  the  intercept  as  the  rulesstate in Table 1. In each case, the resultant intercept would be the same.11.13.3. Suppose the Hc was 33o57'. Applying the correction -22 yields 33o35'. Comparing this with ourHo 33o29' results in an intercept of 6 NM away. If you decide to apply the correction to the Ho, 33o29' +22' yields 33o5l'. Comparing this to the Hc 33o57' yields the same result, 6 NM away. When using theMotion of the Observer table and when the fix time is earlier than the observation (LOP to be retarded),the rule for the sign of the correction is also printed below Table 1.11.14.  Moving  the  Assumed  Position.  Another  method  of  converting  LOPs  to  a  common  time  is  tomove the assumed position. This method is recommended for shots 4 minutes apart computed to give allthree  bodies  a  single  assumed  position.  However,  it  is  not  limited  to  that  type  of  computation.  Theassumed  position  is  moved  along  the  best-known  track  at  the  best-known  GS.  For  example,  againsuppose the track is 330o and the GS 300 knots. LOPs are for 1500, 1504, and 1508 and a fix is desiredat 1508 (Figure 11.11). Since the first LOP would have to be advanced 40 NM (8 min at 300 knots), thesame result is realized by advancing the assumed position 40 NM parallel to the best-known track. The1504 LOP must be advanced 20 NM; therefore, the assumed position is advanced 20 NM miles parallelto the best-known track. The third shot requires no movement and it is plotted from the original assumedposition.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  first  shot  is  always  plotted  from  the  assumed  position,  which  isclosest  to  destination.  In  this  method,  if  observations  are  precomputed  and  the  assumed  position  ismoved  prior  to  shooting,  the  following  procedure  is  used  when  shooting  is  off  schedule.  For  everyminute of time that the shot is taken early, move the assumed position 15 minutes of longitude to theeast.  For  every  minute  of  time  that  the  shot  is  taken  late,  move  the  assumed  position  15  minutes  oflongitude to the west. In addition, the affected LOP must be moved along the best-known track for thenumber of minutes of GS the observation was early or late. If the shot was early, advance the LOP; if theshot was late, retard the LOP.250AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 11.10. Entering Arguments Are Relative True Azimuth and Groundspeed.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 11.11. Moving Assumed Positions.25111.15.  Planning  the  Fix.  In  selecting  bodies  for  observation,  one  should  generally  consider  azimuthprimarily  and  such  factors  as  brightness,  altitude,  etc.,  secondarily.  If  all  observations  were  preciselycorrect in every detail, the resulting LOPs would meet at a point. However, this is rarely the case. Threeobservations generally result in LOPs forming a triangle. If this triangle is not more than 2 or 3 miles ona side under good conditions and 5 to 10 miles under unfavorable conditions, there is normally no reasonto  suppose  that  a  mistake  has  been  made.  Even  a  point  fix,  however,  is  not  necessarily  accurate.  Anuncorrected error in time, for instance, would require the entire fix to be moved eastward if observationswere  early  and  westward  if  observations  were  late,  at  the  rate  of  1  minute  of  longitude  for  each  4seconds of time.11.15.1. In a two-LOP fix, the ideal cut of the LOPs is 90o. In Figure 11.12, a 90o cut with a 5 NM errorin one LOP will cause a 5 NM error in the fix. If the acute angle between the LOPs is 30o, a 5 NM errorin one LOP will cause a 10 NM error in the fix. Thus, with a two-LOP fix, an error in one LOP willcause at least an equal error in the fix; the smaller the acute angle between the LOPs, the greater the fixerror caused by a given error in one LOP. Of course, if both LOPs are in error, the fix may be thrown offeven more. In a three-LOP fix, the ideal cut of the LOPs is 60o (star azimuths 120o apart). With this cut,a 3 NM error in any one LOP will cause a 2 NM error in the fix. With any other cut, a 3 NM error in anyone  LOP  will  cause  more  than  a  2  NM  error  in  the  fix.  In  a  three-star  fix,  the  cut  will  be  60o  if  theazimuths of the stars differ by 60o or if they differ by 120o. If there is any unknown constant error in theobservations, all the Hos will be either too great or too small. Notice in Figure 11.13 that, if stars areselected whose azimuths differ by 120o, this constant error of the Hos will cause a displacement of thethree LOPs, either all toward the center or all away from the center of the triangle. In either case, theposition of the center of the triangle will not be affected. If you use any three stars with azimuths outsidea 180o range, any constant error in observations will tend to cancel out.252AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 11.12. Effect of Cut on Accuracy of a Fix.Figure 11.13. Effect of Azimuth on Accuracy of Fix.11.15.2. The three-star fix has two distinct advantages over the two-star fix. First, it is the average ofthree observations. Second, selecting the stars carefully can counteract the effect of  constant errors ofobservation. There is also a third advantage. Each pair of two LOPs furnishes a rough check on the third.In resolving an observation into a LOP, you might possibly make a gross error; for example, obtainingAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001253an LHA which is in error by a whole degree. Such an error might not be immediately apparent. Neitherwould such a discrepancy come to immediate attention in a two-LOP fix. However, this third advantagedoes not apply when a single LHA is used in solving all LOPs, such as is done when precomputing andusing motion corrections to resolve all LOPs to a common time. Because of these three advantages, it isevident that a three-star fix should be used, rather than a two-star fix, when possible.11.15.3. Whatever the number of observations, common practice, backed by logic, is to take the centerof  the  figure  formed  unless  there  is  reason  for  deviating  from  this  procedure.  Center  is  meant  as  thepoint  representing  the  least  total  error  of  all  lines  considered  reliable.  With  three  LOPs,  the  center  isconsidered that point, within the triangle equidistant from the three sides. It may be found by bisectingthe angles, but is usually located by eye.11.16. Summary. Because of all the factors involved, a certain amount of judgment is necessary, alongwith the proper use of the mechanics comprising celestial navigation. When using a single LOP or a fix,you have to take into consideration the existing conditions and weigh the DR information against theinformation obtained from the LOP. An accurate DR position should always be computed.11.16.1. The C-Plot formula helps place the MPP with a single LOP, but you might want to make furtheradjustments to the final position. The formula is:11.16.2. Remember, d is the distance measured along a perpendicular from the DR position to the LOP.In  the  case  of  the  two-  or  three-star  fix,  planning  plays  a  very  important  part.  Selecting  stars  whoseazimuths differ by 120o for a three-star fix will minimize errors in the fix position. In two-star fixes, theideal azimuth separation is 90o. Also, when dealing with more than one LOP, it is necessary to resolvethe LOPs to a common time. This adjustment can be accomplished by moving the assumed position, bymoving the LOPs, or by applying a correction factor to the Hc or Ho.254AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Chapter 12SPECIAL CELESTIAL TECHNIQUESSection 12A— Introduction12.1.  Basics.  This  chapter  has  some  techniques  which  may  not  be  used  every  day  and  under  allcircumstances  but  are  valuable  alternatives  from  normal  precomping  procedures.  Most  of  thesetechniques  save  time  by  eliminating  either  some  extractions  or  computations.  Some  navigationaltechniques and planning procedures are also discussed.12.2.  Determining  Availability  of  Celestial  Bodies.  By  doing  a  quick  comparison  of  GHA  to  theobserver's position, it is easy to determine the availability of celestial bodies. For example, the observeranticipates being at 18o N 135o W at 0015Z on 28 September 1995. There are several bodies listed in theAir  Almanac,  but  not  all  of  them  are  available  for  observation.  To  determine  availability,  take  theobserver's  longitude  and  look  80o  either  side  of  it.  Within  this  range,  compare  the  GHA  of  a  body.Looking at Figure 12.1 we see that the sun, moon, Venus, and Jupiter are within the 80o range and aretherefore usable. Saturn is outside of the 80o range so it is not usable. The declination of a body is notnormally a factor; however, at high latitudes a body may not be available when its subpoint is near thepole opposite the observer.Figure 12.1. A Quick Check of Body Availability.12.3. Latitude  by  Polaris.  Polaris  is  the  polestar,  or  North  Star.  Because  Polaris  is  approximately  1ofrom  the  North  Pole,  it  makes  a  small  diurnal  circle  and  seemingly  stays  in  about  the  same  place  allnight. This fact makes Polaris very useful in navigation. With certain corrections, it serves as a referencepoint for direction and for latitude in the Northern Hemisphere. Latitude by Polaris is a quick method ofobtaining a latitude line of position (LOP); only the tables given in the Air Almanac are needed.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200125512.3.1.  Obtaining  Latitude  by  Polaris.  A  latitude  by  Polaris  LOP  is  obtained  by  applying  the  "Q"correction (Figure 12.2) to the corrected observed altitude. This adjusts the altitude of the pole, which isequal to the navigator's latitude. The Q correction table is in the back of the Air Almanac. The enteringargument for the table is exact local hour angle (LHA) of Aries. The effect of refraction is not includedin Q correction, so the observed altitude must be fully corrected. When refraction is used for a latitudeby Polaris LOP, it is applied to the observed altitude and the sign of the correction is negative. A PolarisLOP can also be plotted using the intercept method. In this case, the Hc is computed by reversing thesign  of  the  Q  correction  and  applying  it  to  the  assumed  latitude  (rounded  off  to  the  nearest  degree).Refraction is positive when applied to get an Hc for the intercept method.12.3.2. Obtaining Azimuth of Polaris. For either method, the azimuth of Polaris is obtained from theAzimuth of Polaris table found in the Air Almanac or in the Pub. No. 249 (Figure 12.2). Whether plottedas an intercept or a latitude, the  assumed position  should  be  corrected  for  Coriolis  or  rhumb  line  andprecession or nutation. The resulting LOPs should fall in the same place for either method. To plot theLOP using the latitude method, choose the longitude line closest to the DR and plot perpendicular to thelongitude line. For the intercept method, use the assumed latitude and plot the intercept normally usingthe azimuth of Polaris.256AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 12.2. Polaris Q Correction and Azimuth Tables From the Air Almanac.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 12.3. Plotting the Polaris LOP.25712.3.3. Latitude by Polaris Example. On 18 April 1995 for Greenwich mean time (GMT) 1600 at 23o-10' N 120o W, with an observed altitude 23o-06' at 31,000'. When doing a latitude by Polaris you mustuse the exact latitude and longitude. See Figure 12.3 for plotting.GHALongitude (West)LHATrue Course (TC) = 090oGroundspeed (GS) = 400 knotsCoriolis/rhumb line = 7RCorrected Observed AltitudeQ (based on LHA 072-44)RefractionLatitudeAzimuth (LHA 326o-18', Latitude 23oN) = 000.8o086o-18'-120o-00'326o-18'23o-06'-15'-01'22o-50'NOTE:  If  the  Q  correction  table  in  Volume  1  is  used,  precession  and  nutation  (P/N)  and  Coriolis  orrhumb line must be used in plotting the LOP. This is because the Pub. No. 249 covers a 5-year periodand the further the years get from the Epoch year, the greater the error is when using the Polaris table.P/N compensates for this error.258AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200112.3.4.

No P/N is required.Section 12B— LHA Method of Fixing12.4. LHA Method of Obtaining Three-Star Fix. The LHA technique allows you to solve the motionproblem for a three-star fix by applying a correction to the assumed position rather than computing  anumerical  solution  on  the  precomp.  This  eliminates  mathematical  motion  calculations,  thereforereducing the chance of math errors on the precomp. To accomplish a three-LHA fix, you must plan 4minutes between the midtime of each shot (Figures 12.4 and 12.5). Because LHA changes 1 degree forevery 4 minutes, the precomp will have three successive LHAs, 1 degree apart. To correct for off-timemotion, adjust the assumed position based on true course and groundspeed. If a shot is planned earlierthan fix time, the assumed position is advanced (down-track). For shots planned later than fix time, theassumed position is retarded (up-track).12.4.1.  The  example  in  Figures  12.4  and  12.5  shows  the  LHA  method  for  a  12-8-4  early  shootingschedule. This shooting schedule allows the fix and/or MPP to be resolved before the fix time. To adjustthe assumed positions, plot the fix time assumed position and then advance it for 4 minutes of track andgroundspeed for each body. This will satisfy motion of the observer. When shooting the selected bodies,take care to shoot them exactly on the prescribed times. This will eliminate motion of the body.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001259Figure 12.4. Typical Example of Three LHA Method.260AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 12.5. Plotting Three LHA.12.4.2. A variation of advancing the assumed position is to use half motions. This will enable you to plotall three LOPs from one assumed position. Table 1 from Pub. No. 249 lists corrections to position of theobserver. Each correction is for 4 minutes of time. To use it, enter with your relative Zn (Zn-Track) andgroundspeed.  Now  look  at  the  bottom  of  the  table  and  note  you  can  apply  this  correction  to  yourtabulated  altitude  or  observed  altitude.  It  doesn't  matter  which  you  choose  but  note  that  the  sign  willchange  dependent  on  where  you  apply  it.  Now  take  the  number  and  multiply  it  by  the  4-minuteincrement of the shot. For example, Figure 12.6 shows the precomp for a 0300 fix using 3 LHAs andhalf  motions.  The  0248  shot,  Alpheratz,  relative  Zn,  and  groundspeed  were  used  to  extract  a  +20correction from Table 1. Because this shot is 12 minutes early we need to multiply +20 by three beforewe apply it to the shot. Note the +60 correction was applied to the observed altitude and therefore keptits  positive  sign.  The  benefit  of  doing  this  is  a  reduction  in  plotting.  See  Figure  12.7  for  the  plottedLOPs. This technique can be applied to day celestial as well.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001  Figure 12.6. Half Motions Three LHA Format. 261                   262AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 12.7. Plotting a Half Motions Observation.Section 12C— Daytime Celestial Techniques12.5. Basics. Daytime fixing, using celestial techniques, is rather limited because often only one body,the sun, is visible. Ordinarily, three LOPs cannot be obtained for a fix from one body because the LOPsplot nearly parallel to each other.12.6. The Sun Heading Shot at High Noon. The azimuth  of  the  sun  changes  very  rapidly  when  thesubpoint of the sun is directly over the longitude of the observer, i.e., called the time of transit. The LHAat transit time is 360o. This phenomenon is more pronounced at lower latitudes as the subpoint of the sunpasses closer to the observer. This makes it extremely difficult to get an accurate celestial heading shotat the transit time. Therefore, if  you need a heading shot near the time of transit, you must take extraprecaution to get the heading observation exactly at the precomputed fix time. If the moon or Venus isavailable,  consider  using  these  bodies  for  an  accurate  celestial  heading.  If  using  the  sun,  you  shouldAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001263weigh the increased possibility of an inaccurate heading shot. If the accuracy is questionable, get anotherheading shot as the sun's rate of azimuth change slows enough to allow a more accurate shot.12.7. Intercept Method. The intercept method is normally used in obtaining a noonday fix. If the sunpasses close to the observer's position, within about 4o, the subpoint method of plotting the fix may beused. This method  differs  from  normal  procedures  in  that  three  different  precomps  for  three  differenttimes are computed. Because of the rapid change of the sun's azimuth at or near transit, this variation isnecessary. The procedure is:12.7.1. Determine the time of transit.12.7.2. Select the LHA before and after transit for which the change in azimuth is 30o or more. Since 1oof LHA is equal to 4 minutes of time, the difference in transit LHA and the new LHA can be convertedto time in minutes. Thus, the time preceding and following transit can be determined.12.7.3. Plot the DR positions for times determined in 12.7.2. Select the appropriate assumed positionsnecessary for the computation and plotting of the LOPs. The assumed position for time of transit is alsoplotted.12.7.4. Determine the intercepts and azimuth for each LOP. Plot these data from the respective assumedpositions.12.7.5. Resolve the LOPs to a common time, preferably that of the transit LOP.NOTE:  At  30o  N  latitude,  the  linear  speed  of  the  sun  is  approximately  780  knots.  Thus,  on  westerlyheadings in high-speed aircraft, the DR distance involved before encountering a 30o change in azimuthwill be considerable.12.8. Subpoint Method. When the observer is within approximately 4o of the subpoint of the body, thesubpoint method of solution is normally used. This is because the radius of the circle of equal altitude isso small that a straight line does not approximate the arc and a straight line will not give  an accurateLOP. The procedure is:12.8.1. Plot the subpoints of the body for the time of the observations (using GHA and/or Dec).12.8.2. Find the co-altitude of the shots and convert it to NM ([90o – Alt] x 60 NM).12.8.3. Advance the first subpoint and retard the third along the DR track, using best-known track andGS.12.8.4. Set the distance found from the co-altitude and strike it off from the resolved subpoints (with acompass or pair of dividers). Do this for each observation.NOTE: The resulting intersection or triangle will give an on-time fix. If the LOPs form a triangle, theaircraft position is probably within the triangle.264AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200112.8.5. The subpoint method is convenient because Pub. No. 249 isn't used— only the Air Almanac. Thismethod  can  also  be  used  with  a  star  near  your  assumed  position  and  may  be  necessary  if,  for  somereason, your Volume 1 is unavailable. The stars Dec and GHA are needed to determine if the observer iswithin 4o of the subpoint. The Air Almanac may be used to find the Dec and sidereal hour angle (SHA)of the star. The SHA of the star is added to the GHA of Aries to find the GHA of the star.12.9.  Eliminating  Motions  with  the  Bracket  Technique.  For  sun  observations,  you  can  eliminatemotion  calculations  by  using  a  shooting  schedule  of  3  minutes  early,  on  fix  time  and  3-minutes  late.With this schedule, the 3-minute early and 3-minute late shots have the same magnitude of motion, butan opposite sign. Therefore, these motions cancel each other out and do not need to be computed. Theon-time shot has no motions. Therefore, the three intercepts can be averaged for a single LOP. At night,shooting the same star 4 minutes early and late, with a different star shot on time can employ a similarmethod. In this case, the intercepts for the same star's 4-minute early or late shots can be averaged. Thisreduces workload, but only two LOPs are obtained.12.10.  DR  Computer  Modification.  Rather  than  eliminating  motions,  your  DR  computer  can  bemodified so both observer and body motions can be computed at one time, without entry into the Pub.No.  249.  Make  a  GS  and  latitude  scale  as  shown  in  Figure  12.8.  After  constructing  these,  the  DRcomputer can be modified for quick and accurate computations of 1-minute motion adjustments.12.10.1. Tape the GS scale (0 through 900) along the centerline of the grid scale. Match zero to zero,300 to 50 and 600 to 100 as shown in Figure 12.8. Then, tape the latitude scale along the zero grid lineso that 90o falls on the centerline and the scale extends to the left as shown. Check the accuracy of yourplacement:  30o  latitude  should  fall  13  divisions  left  of  centerline.  Juggle  the  scale  as  necessary  toprovide the greatest accuracy between 30o and 45o.Figure 12.8. MB-4 Motions Modification.12.10.2. To use the modified MB-4 computer for motion adjustments:12.10.2.1. Set true north under the index. If computing for grid, set polar angle (PA) under the index. Inthe NW and SE hemisphere quadrants PA equals convergence angle (CA). In the NE and SW quadrantsAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001265PA=360-CA. Next place the grommet over the zero grid line. Mark a cross (+) at the assumed latitude(Figure 12.9).Figure 12.9. Celestial Motions – Step One.12.10.2.2.  Set  track  (or  grid  track)  under  the  index  and  position  the  slide  so  the  GS  is  under  thegrommet. Place a dot on the zero point of the grid scale (Figure 12.10).12.10.2.3. Place the Zn (or grid Zn) of the body under the index. Position the slide so the cross or thedot, whichever is uppermost, is on the zero line of the grid (Figure 12.11).266AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 12.10.

Combinations of Sun, Moon, and Venus. The moon or Venus are often visible during daylighthours  and  can  be  used  to  obtain  an  LOP.  Always  consider  fixing  using  these  bodies  during  daylightcelestial  flights.  When  planning  the  flight,  use  the  sky  diagrams  in  the  Air  Almanac  to  determine  theavailability of the moon and Venus. If the bodies are available, they can be readily found by accuratelyprecomputing their altitudes and azimuths.12.11.1. When looking for Venus, take all the filters out of the sextant and point it at the precise locationof the planet. A bright, small pinpoint of light will be visible but hard to detect, unless sky conditions268AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001and separation from the sun are ideal. With practice, acquisition should become easier and you will befamiliar with those conditions conducive to successfully making a Venus shot.12.11.2. During the day when the sun is high, the moon or Venus, if they are available, can be used toobtain compass deviation checks. In polar regions during periods of continuous twilight, the moon andVenus will be available if their declination (Dec) is the same name as the latitude.12.12. Duration of  Light.  Sunrise  and  sunset  at  sea  level  and  at  altitude,  moonrise  and  moonset  andsemiduration graphs will not be discussed in detail in this chapter. It is imperative; however, to preplanfor any mission where twilight occurs during the course of the flight, especially at the higher latitudeswhere twilight extends over longer periods of time. An excellent discussion, with appropriate examples,is provided in the Air Almanac and should be sufficient for those missions requiring detailed planning.Section 12D— True Heading Celestial Observation12.13.  Basics.  The  periscopic  sextant,  in  addition  to  measuring  celestial  altitudes,  can  be  used  todetermine  true  headings  (TH)  and  true  bearings  (TB).  Any  celestial  body,  whose  azimuth  can  becomputed, can be used to obtain a TH. Except for Polaris, the appropriate volume of Pub. No. 249 isentered to obtain Zn (true bearing). In the case of Polaris, the  Air Almanac has an azimuth of Polaristable. It does not require information from the Pub. No. 249 tables. The two methods used to obtain THswith the periscopic sextant. The TB method requires precomputation of  Zn. Postcomputation of Zn ispossible with the inverse relative bearing (IRB) method. The procedures are as follows:12.14. True Bearing (TB) Method:12.14.1.

If Polaris is used, obtain the azimuth from the Azimuthof Polaris table in the Air Almanac and use your latitude instead of Hc (Figure 12.13).12.14.5. Set Zn in the azimuth counter window with the azimuth crank and set Hc in the altitude counterwindow with the altitude control knob.12.14.6. Collimate the body at the precomputed time and read the TH of the aircraft under the verticalcrosshair in the field of vision. If you are using precomputation techniques, a TH is available every timean altitude observation is made.NOTE: Shot must be taken at precomp time.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001269Figure 12.12.

At the desired time, read the IRB under the vertical crosshair in the field ofvision.12.15.3. Compute Zn of the celestial body and use the formula:TH = Zn + IRBSection 12E— Celestial Navigation in High Latitudes12.16. Basics. Celestial navigation in polar regions is of primary importance because (1) it constitutes aprimary  method  of  determining  position  other  than  by  DR  and  (2)  it  provides  a  reliable  means  ofestablishing direction over much of the polar regions. The magnetic compass and directional gyro (DG)are useful in polar regions, but they require an independent check, which can be provided by a celestialbody or other automatic systems such as INS or GPS.272AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200112.16.1.  At  high  latitudes,  the  sun's  daily  motion  is  nearly  parallel  to  the  horizon.  The  motion  of  theaircraft in these regions can easily have greater effect upon altitude and Zn of the sun than the motion ofthe sun itself.12.16.2. At latitude 64o, an aircraft flying west at 400k keeps pace with the sun, which appears to remainstationary in the sky. At higher latitudes, the altitude of a celestial body might be increasing at any timeof day, if the aircraft is flying toward it and a body might rise or set, at any azimuth, depending upon thedirection of motion of the aircraft relative to the body.12.17. Bodies Available for Observation. During the continuous daylight of the polar summer, only thesun  is  regularly  available  for  observation.  The  moon  is  above  the  horizon  about  half  the  time,  butgenerally it is both visible and at a favorable position with respect to the sun for only a few days eachmonth.12.17.1. During the long polar twilight, no celestial bodies may be available for observation. As in lowerlatitudes, the first celestial bodies to appear after sunset and the last to remain visible before sunrise arethose brighter planets, which are above the horizon.12.17.2. The sun, moon, and planets are never high in polar skies, thus making low altitude observationsroutine. Particularly with the sun, observations are made when any part of the celestial body is visible. Ifit is partly below the horizon, the upper limb is observed and a correction of -16' for semidiameter (SD)is used in the SD block of the precomputation form.12.17.3. During the polar night, stars are available. Polaris is not generally used because it is too near thezenith in the arctic and not visible in the Antarctic. A number of good stars are in favorable positions forobservation. Because of large refractions near the horizon avoid low altitudes (below about 20o) whenhigher bodies are visible.12.18. Sight Reduction. Sight reduction in polar regions presents some slightly different problems fromthose at lower latitudes. Remember, for latitudes greater than 69o N or 69o S, Pub. No. 249 tables havetabulated Hcs and azimuths for only even degrees of LHA. This concerns you in two ways. First, it willbe  necessary  to  adjust  assumed  longitude  to  achieve  a  whole,  even  LHA  for  extractions.  This  willpreclude interpolating. Second, the difference between successive, tabulated Hcs is for 2o of LHA, or 8minutes of time, so this difference must be divided in half when  computing motion of the body for 4minutes of time.12.18.1. For ease of plotting, all azimuths can be converted to grid. To convert, use the longitude of theassumed  position  to  determine  convergence  because  the  Zn  is  for  the  assumed  position,  not  the  DRposition. On polar charts, convergence is equal to longitude.12.18.2. In computing motion of the observer, it is imperative that you use the difference between gridazimuth and grid track, or Zn and true track, since this computation is based on relative bearing (RB).Zn minus grid course does not give relative bearing.12.18.3.  Since  low  altitudes  and  low  temperatures  are  normal  in  polar  regions,  refer  to  the  refractioncorrection table and use the temperature correction factor for all observations.12.18.4. In polar regions, Coriolis corrections reach maximum values and should be carefully computed.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200127312.19. Poles as Assumed Positions. Within approximately 2o of the pole, it is possible to use the pole asthe assumed position. With this method, no tabulated celestial computation is necessary and the positionmay be determined by use of the Air Almanac alone.12.19.1. At either of the poles of the earth, the zenith and the elevated poles are coincident or the planeof the horizon is coincident with the plane of the equator. Vertical circles coincide with the meridiansand parallels of latitude coincide with Dec circles. Therefore, the altitude of the body is equal to its Decand the azimuth is equal to its hour angle.12.19.2.  To  plot  any  LOP,  an  intercept  and  the  azimuth  of  the  body  are  needed.  In  this  solution,  theelevated pole is the assumed position. The azimuth is plotted as the GHA of the body, or the longitudeof  the  subpoint.  The  intercept  is  found  by  comparing  the  Dec  of  the  body,  as  taken  from  the  AirAlmanac, with the observed altitude of the body. To summarize, the pole is the assumed position, theDec is the Hc, and the GHA equals the azimuth.12.19.3. For ease of plotting, convert the GHA of the body to grid azimuth by adding or subtracting 180owhen using the North Pole as the assumed position. When at the South Pole, 360o – GHA of the bodyequals grid azimuth. The result will allow the use of the grid lines for plotting the LOPs. When usinggrid azimuth for plotting, apply Coriolis to the assumed position (in this case, the pole). Precession ornutation  corrections  are  not  necessary  since  current  SHA  and  Dec  are  used.  Motion  of  the  observertables  may  also  be  used  in  precomputation,  since  grid  azimuth  relative  to  grid  course  may  bedetermined. Motion of the body is zero at the poles.12.19.4. Note the exact GMT of the celestial observation. From the Air Almanac, extract the proper Decand GHA. Plot the azimuth. Compare  Ho  and  Hc  to  obtain  the  intercept.  When  the  observed  altitude(Ho) is greater than the Dec (Hc), it is necessary to go from the pole toward the celestial body along theazimuth. If the observed altitude is less than the Dec, as is the case with the sun in Figure 12.15, it isnecessary to go from the pole away from the body along the azimuth. Draw the LOPs perpendicular tothe azimuth line in the usual manner. Don't be concerned about large intercepts; they have no bearing onthe accuracy of this type of fix. Observations on well-separated bearings give a fix that is as good closeto the pole as it is anywhere else.274AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 12.15. Using Pole as Assumed Position.Section 12F— Adjusting Assumed Position12.20. Adjusting Assumed Position for Off-Time Shot. There will be times when the observer doesnot start the shot at the prescribed time for various reasons. For example, the observer may struggle tofind the body due to cloud cover. If a shot is taken off time, you can use the FEAST (Fast EAST) rule: ashot taken too fast or too early has the assumed position moved 15' of longitude east for each minuteearly to compensate for body motion (see example in Figure 12.16). Apply the reverse of the FEASTrule for late shots (move the assumed position west). This adjusted position is then advanced or retardedfor  track  and  GS  to  account  for  motion  of  the  observer,  applying  the  same  concept  used  in  thethree-LHA method (Figure 12-5). This technique for solving motions is also discussed in Chapter 10.EXAMPLE: Original assumed position:23o-50' N 120o-00' WMove 15' of longitude west for 1 minute lateRetard 6NM from track of 360o THNew assumed position23o-44' N 120o-15' WAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001275Figure 12.16. Corrections for Off-Time Shooting.12.21. Longitude Adjustment Principle. You will occasionally make errors in your precomputations.Possibly the most common would be an extraction error of the GHA or math error while computing theLHA. If one of these numbers is incorrect, then all the extractions from the Pub. No. 249 would be basedon  erroneous  information  and  the  result  would  be  an  LOP  error.  Fortunately  there  is  a  way  ofcompensating for this type of error without having to reenter the table and retrieving the correct data.This  method  is  called  the  Longitude  Adjustment  Principle  (LAP).  You  need  only  adjust  the  assumedlongitude  (up  to  2  1/2o)  to  correct  for  a  GHA  extraction  error,  or  a  math  error.  Moving  the  assumedposition beyond the 2 1/2o induces some error in the plotting LOP. Suppose you wanted the GHA for1410Z (Figure 12.17), you extracted the value for 1400Z and applied it to the longitude. The resultantLHA was used and the precomp completed before you realized your error. To do the LAP first, extractthe correct GHA (031-20), keep the old LHA, and adjust the longitude so that the math is correct (Figure12.18).  A  math  error  can  occur  in  solving  for  the  LHA  (Figure  12.19).  Once  you  have  corrected  theprecomp, use the adjusted longitude for your assumed longitude to plot the LOP.276AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 12.17. LAP Using Incorrect GHA.Figure 12.18.

Any  of  the  techniques  discussed  here,  if  used  on  a  regular  basis,  can  be  just  asaccurate  as  normal  precomping  procedures  and  save  some  time  as  well.  These  techniques  are  not  allinclusive.  There  are  many  commercial  publications  available  as  a  source  for  celestial  navigators:  forexample, American Practical Navigator by Bowditch (available through the NIMA) and the Journal ofthe Institute of Navigation (available through the Institute of Navigation).278AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Chapter 13SEXTANTS AND ERRORS OF OBSERVATIONSection 13A— Sextants13.1.  Introduction.  For  hundreds  of  years,  mariners  have  navigated  the  seas  keeping  track  of  theirpositions  by  use  of  the  sextant.  This  instrument  measured  the  altitude  of  celestial  bodies  (angulardistance above the horizon) and the information derived from this measurement was used to determinethe  position  of  the  vessel.  All  celestial  navigation  follows  this  rule.  Today's  navigator  measures  thealtitude of the celestial bodies in much the same manner as Magellan or Columbus.13.1.1.  However,  there  is  a  difference  between  air  and  marine  celestial  navigation.  Because  marinenavigators are on the surface of the ocean, they  can  establish their horizon by  referring to the naturalhorizon. In an aircraft, this is impossible because altitude and aircraft attitude induce error. In the sextantdesigned for air navigation, a bubble, like the one in a carpenter's level, determines an artificial horizon,which is parallel to the celestial horizon. The bubble chamber is placed in the sextant so the bubble issuperimposed upon the field of view. Both the celestial body and the bubble are viewed simultaneously,making it possible to keep the sextant level while sighting the body.13.1.2. Sextants are subject to certain errors that must be compensated for when determining an LOP.Some of these errors are instrument errors while others are induced by the various in-flight conditions.The first half of this chapter discusses the sextant and the second half explains sextant errors.13.2.  The  Bubble  Sextant.  The  aircraft  bubble  sextant  measures  altitude  above  a  horizontal  planeestablished by a bubble. Aviators use several types of bubble sextants, all of which are indirect sighting.This  means  the  navigator  does  not  look  directly  toward  the  celestial  body,  but  always  looks  in  ahorizontal direction as shown in Figure 13.1. The image of the body is reflected into the field of viewwhen the field prism is set at the correct angle. In the bubble sextant, the bubble and body are visible inthe same field of view. The sextant system consists of four parts: the mount, the sextant, the electricalcables and the carrying case.13.3.  The  Mount.  The  mount,  as  shown  in  Figure  13.2,  is  fastened  permanently  to  the  top  of  thefuselage of the aircraft. A shutter door is built into the mount to close the opening for the tube of theperiscopic sextant. This shutter door is controlled by the sextant port lever (1) on the mount. The mounthas a gimbal mechanism, which allows the sextant to be tilted from the vertical in any direction. Thispermits a celestial body to be observed throughout the normal oscillations of an aircraft. A drain plug (2)is provided at the low point in the shutter well for draining out water, which may have collected in themount.NOTE:  The  numbers  in  parentheses  in  13.3,  13.3.1,  and  13.3.2  refer  to  the  parts  indicated  in  Figure13.2.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 13.1. Body Is Not Sighted Directly.27913.3.1.  The  sextant  is  held  in  the  mount  by  two  locking  pins  (4),  located  in  a  movable  collar  on  thebottom of the mount. One pin locks the sextant into the mount and holds it in the retracted position; theother pin locks the sextant in the extended position. These pins are spring-loaded and must be pulled outto release the sextant. Located next to these locking pins is a friction clamping lever (3), which providesthe observer with the option of locking the sextant at a fixed azimuth or, when the tension is released,the sextant may be rotated through 360o of azimuth. The azimuth scale (10) and azimuth counter (6) willmove when the azimuth crank (5) is rotated. The azimuth scale can be read against a lubber line or index(11). The azimuth scale read against the lubber line and the azimuth counter reading should be the same.13.3.2. Power is supplied from the aircraft through a cable connection (9) on the side of the mount. Aswitch (8) on the side of the mount controls power to both the mount and the sextant. The mount has onelamp that illuminates the azimuth counter window. Another cable (7) is connected to the socket on theunderside of the mount and supplies power to the sextant itself.13.4.  The  Periscopic  Sextant.  The  periscopic  sextant  is  an  optical  instrument  which  enables  thenavigator to determine true azimuth (Zn), relative bearing (RB), and altitude angle of a celestial bodyand aircraft true heading (TH). The sextant provides an angle of observation from below the horizon todirectly overhead, as compared to an artificial horizon.280AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 13.2. Periscopic Sextant Mount.13.4.1. Proper collimation techniques and  the  correct  size  bubble  are  essential  ingredients  of  accuratecelestial observations. Collimation is effected when the body is placed in the center of the bubble. Forgreatest  accuracy,  the  bubble  should  be  in  the  center  of  the  field,  with  the  body  in  the  center  of  thebubble. The error will be small if the bubble is anywhere on the vertical line of the field, as long as itdoes  not  touch  the  top  or  bottom  of  the  bubble  chamber.  Figure  13.3  shows  examples  from  better  toworse collimation.Figure 13.3. Correct and Incorrect Collimation.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200128113.4.2. Bubble size affects the accuracy of a sextant observation. The ideal situation for collimation is tohave a small bubble for ease in determining the center. A bubble that is too small will stick to the lens,decreasing accuracy. A bubble that is too large will move like a creature from a science fiction movie,making  it  difficult  to  find  the  center.  Experience  shows  that  best  results  are  obtained  with  a  bubbleapproximately  one  and  a  half  times  the  apparent  diameter  of  the  sun  or  moon,  or  about  the  size  of  aCheerio. The field prism is geared to an altitude scale so that when the body is collimated the altitudecan be read from the scale.13.4.3. An averaging mechanism is also incorporated which allows the navigator to take an observationover a period of time. The  continuous motion of the aircraft affects the bubble  and resultant  artificialhorizon.  This  movement  resolves  itself  into  a  cycle  in  which  the  aircraft  rolls,  yaws,  and  pitches.  Toobtain  an  accurate  reading,  it  is  necessary  to  sight  the  body  for  a  period  of  time  during  this  cyclicmovement and to average the results of a series of sightings. An averaging device has been incorporatedin the sextant so an average reading can be obtained.13.4.4. The sextant (Figure 13.4) is actually a low-power periscope with a 15o field of view. All lenssurfaces in the sextant are coated to minimize light loss. To prevent condensation when the tip of thesextant is extended into cold air, the tube is filled with a dry gas and sealed. A desiccant (composed ofsilica gel) is used to remove moisture and check on the dryness of the gas inside the tube, and is visiblein the periscopic end of the sextant, or in some models, on the sextant body. When the silica gel is pink,there is moisture in the tube and the sextant should be replaced before flight.NOTE: The numbers in parentheses in 13.4.5 through 13.4.11 refer to the parts indicated in Figure 13.4.Figure 13.4. Periscopic Sextant.282AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200113.4.5. An eyepiece (1) rotates to correct the eyesight of the individual observer. Filters (2) are providedfor selective use in the optical system so that the intensity of the sun's light might be adequately reduced.The filter control (2) is located on the left of the sextant.13.4.6. Most sextants currently in use have been modified with an electronic device for accomplishingall the functions of the averaging mechanism. General differences in these and the unmodified sextantsare addressed in this discussion.13.4.7.  A  start  switch  (4)  (a  start  and  stop  or  averager  operating  lever  [4A]  on  unmodified  sextants)starts and stops the operation of the sextant. Adjacent to this switch is the reset switch (5) (the averagerrewind  lever,  if  unmodified  [5A]  located  below  the  averager  operating  lever).  The  reset  switch  oraverager  rewind  lever  has  four  functions.  When  depressed  and  released,  it  does  the  following:  (1)removes the shutter from the field of vision, (2) zeroes and resets (rewinds if unmodified) the timer, (3)zeroes  the  averager  and  places  initial  values  in  registers  and  data  memory  (realigns  indices  onunmodified sextants), and (4) disconnects the altitude control knob from the averager.13.4.8. The bubble control knob (6) should be left in the maximum increase position after adjustmentshave been made. With the control in the maximum increase position, an aneroid is locked to the bubblechamber to compensate for changes in ambient pressure and temperature.13.4.9. On the front of the sextant, there is a rheostat control (7) which varies the intensity of the light inthe  bubble  chamber.  The  altitude  knob  (8)  is  located  on  the  right  side  of  the  sextant.  It  keeps  theobserved body in vertical collimation during the period of the observation. At the end of the scheduledobservation,  it  adjusts  the  altitude  counter  until  the  exact  average  indication  appears,  or  to  align  theindices on unmodified sextants. The body's altitude is read in the altitude counter (9). Directly behindthe altitude knob is the averager display (10) (half-time dial and indices if unmodified). The averagerdisplay  or  half-time  dial  is  graduated  from  0-60  and  indicates  the  half  time  of  the  observation.  Theindices, when aligned, permit the direct reading of the observed altitude on the altitude dial.13.4.10. In the periscope sextant, the averaging is accomplished by microprocessor (Deimel-Black ballintegrator if unmodified), which effects a continuous moving averager over any observation period up to2 minutes. This system has many advantages over other known averaging devices: it is very simple tooperate. A single switch (or lever) sets or winds the mechanism and no other presetting of the sextant,timing mechanism, or averaging is necessary. It is continuously integrating altitude against elapsed time.After at least 30 seconds, it may be stopped at any time up to 2 minutes. The average altitude is readdirectly  from  the  counter.  A  half-time  clock  will  indicate  the  half  time  of  the  observation.  The  timeindication may be added directly to the time of starting the observation to compute the mean time of theobservation.  At  the  end  of  the  observation,  the  averager  energizes  a  solenoid  (actuates  a  lever  ifunmodified)  which  drops  a  shutter  across  the  field  of  view,  indicating  the  end  of  the  observation.Although it is possible to utilize an instantaneous shot, the normal timed observation lasts for 2 minutes.It is impossible to time any observation for less than 30 seconds using the sextant timer.13.4.11. A heading scale shutter (diffuser lever) control (11) provides a convenient means of blockingout the bright illumination on the azimuth scale for night celestial observations. The objective lens (12)is located just above the heading scale shutter control. The lens aligns the azimuth scale of the sextantwith the longitudinal axis of the aircraft. The lens can be rotated with the fingers in order to calibrate theazimuth scale on a known bearing while looking through the eyepiece. The objectives lens can removeup  to  2o  azimuth  error  in  the  azimuth  ring.  A  locking  ring  beneath  the  lens  prevents  accidentalAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001283movement.  A  dial  lamp  located  on  the  right  side  of  the  sextant  provides  three  beams  of  light  toilluminate the averager indicators, the  altitude counter,  and the watch clip. The watch clip is made  tohold an old-fashioned pocket watch.13.5.  Electrical  Cables.  Cables  provide  power  for  sextant  operation  and  illumination.  One  "Y"  cableprovides power from the mount to the sextant for illumination and averager operation.13.6. Sextant Case. The case provides shock-absorbent storage for the sextant when it is not in use. Thesextant fits into formfitting foam blocks and is secured by straps. The case also contains spare bulbs forsextant illumination and provides storage for the electrical cable.Section 13B— Errors of Sextant Observation13.7. Basics. If collimation of the body with the bubble and reading the sextant were all that had to bedone, celestial navigation would be simple. This would mean LOPs that are accurate to within 1 or 2miles could be obtained without any further effort. Unfortunately, considerable errors are encountered inevery sextant observation made from an aircraft. A thorough understanding of the cause and magnitudeof these errors, as well as the proper application of corrections to either Hc or Hs, will help minimizetheir effects. Remember that any correction applied to the Hs may be applied to the Hc with a reversesign. Accuracy of celestial navigation depends upon thorough application of these corrections togetherwith proper shooting techniques. The errors of sextant observation may be classified into four groups:(1) parallax, (2) refraction, (3) acceleration, and (4) instrument.13.8. Parallax Error. Parallax in altitude is the difference between the altitude of a body above a bubblehorizon at the surface of the earth and its calculated altitude above the celestial horizon at the center ofthe earth. All Hcs are given for the center of the earth. If the light rays reaching the earth from a celestialbody are parallel, the body has the same altitude at both the center and the surface of the earth. For mostcelestial bodies, parallax is negligible for purposes of navigation.13.8.1. Parallax Correction for the Moon. The moon is so close to the earth that its light rays are notparallel.  The  parallax  of  the  moon  may  be  as  great  as  1o;  thus,  when  observing  the  moon,  a  parallaxcorrection must be applied to the Hs. This correction is always positive (+) and varies with the altitudeand with the distance of the moon from the earth. The  correction  varies  from  day  to  day  because  thedistance of the moon from the earth varies. Corrections for the moon's parallax in altitude are given onthe daily pages of the Air Almanac and are always added, algebraically, to sextant altitudes. The valuesof parallax for negative altitudes are obtained from the Air Almanac for the equivalent positive altitudes.13.8.2.  Semidiameter  Correction.  This  correction  is  found  on  the  daily  pages  of  the  Air  Almanac.Apply it when shooting the upper or lower limb of the moon or the sun.13.8.2.1.  It  is  more  likely  to  occur  on  observations  of  the  moon  because,  when  the  moon  is  not  full(completely round), the center is difficult to estimate. Shoot either the upper or lower limb and apply thesemidiameter  correction  listed  on  the  Air  Almanac  page  for  the  time  and  date  of  the  observation.Subtract the correction from the Hs when shooting the upper limb; add the correction to the Hs whenshooting the lower limb. Reverse the sign if applying the correction to the Hc.13.8.2.2. Listed on the same page is the semidiameter correction for the sun, which is applied the sameway as for the moon.284AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001EXAMPLE: Using Figure 13.5 extract the corrections for the upper limb of the moon as observed on 11August 1995 at 1100Z is 33o41'. Apply these corrections as:HsParallaxSemidiameterHo33o41'+49'-16'34o14'13.9. Atmospheric Refraction Error. Still another factor to be taken into consideration is atmosphericrefraction.  If  a  fishing  pole  is  partly  submerged  under  water,  it  appears  to  bend  at  the  surface.  Thebending of light rays as they pass from the water into the air causes this appearance. This bending of thelight rays, as they pass from one medium into another, is called refraction. The refraction of light from acelestial body as it passes through the atmosphere causes an error in sextant observation.13.9.1. As the light of a celestial body passes from the almost perfect vacuum of outer space into theatmosphere,  it  is  refracted  as  shown  in  Figure  13.6  so  that  the  body  appears  a  little  higher  above  thehorizon than it really is. Therefore, the correction to the Hs for refraction is always negative. The higherthe  body  above  the  horizon,  the  smaller  the  amount  of  refraction  and,  consequently,  the  smaller  therefraction  correction.  Moreover,  the  greater  the  altitude  of  the  aircraft,  the  less  dense  the  layer  ofatmosphere between the body and the observer; hence, the less the refraction.13.9.2. The appropriate correction table for atmospheric refraction is listed inside the back cover of allfour books used for celestial computations; namely, the Air Almanac and each of the three volumes ofPub. No. 249. This table, shown in Figure 13.7, lists the refraction for different observed altitudes of thebody and for different heights of the observer above sea level. The values shown are subtracted from Hsor added to Hc.13.10. Acceleration Error. Presently, the only practical and continuously available reference datum forthe definition of the true vertical is the direction of the gravitational field of the earth. Definition of thisvertical establishes the artificial horizon. It is also fundamental that the forces caused by gravity cannotbe  separated  by  those  caused  by  accelerations  within  the  sextant.  A  level  or  centered  bubble  in  thesextant indicates the true vertical only when the instrument is at rest or moving at a constant velocity ina straight line. Any outside force (changes in GS or changes in track) will affect the liquid in the bubblechamber and, consequently, displace the bubble.13.10.1. When the sextant is moved in a curved path (Coriolis, changes in heading, rhumb line) or withvarying speed, the zenith indicated by the bubble is displaced from the true vertical. This presents a falseartificial horizon above which the altitude of the celestial body is measured. Since the horizon used isfalse,  the  altitude  measured  from  it  is  erroneous.  Therefore,  the  accuracy  of  celestial  observations  isdirectly  related  to  changes  in  track  and  speed  of  the  aircraft.  Acceleration  errors  have  two  principalcauses: changes in GS and curvature of the aircraft's path in space.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 13.5. Correction for Moon's Parallax.285286AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 13.6. Error Caused by Atmospheric Refraction.Figure 13.7. Corrections for Atmospheric Refraction.13.10.2. The displacement of the liquid and the bubble in the chamber may be divided into two vectorsand each vector may be considered separately. These vectors may be thought of as a lateral vector (alongthe  wings)  and  a  longitudinal  vector  (along  the  nose-tail  axis  of  the  aircraft).  Any  change  in  GS  canAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001287cause a longitudinal displacement. This change can be brought about by a change in the airspeed or thewind encountered, or the change in GS brought about by a change in heading due to other factors (gyroprecession,  rhumb  line  error,  etc.).  A  lateral  displacement  results  from  a  number  of  causes,  most  ofwhich will occur in spite of any efforts to hold them in check. These causes are Coriolis, rhumb line, andwander errors.13.11. Coriolis Force. Any free-moving body traveling at a constant speed above the earth is subject toan  apparent  force  that  deflects  its  path  to  the  right  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  and  to  the  left  in  theSouthern Hemisphere. This apparent force and the  resulting  acceleration  were  first  discovered  shortlybefore  the  middle  of  the  19th  century  by  Gaspard  Gustave  de  Coriolis  (1792-1843)  and  givenquantitative  formulation  by  William  Ferrel  (1817-1891).  The  acceleration  is  known  as  Coriolisacceleration (or force) or simply Coriolis and is expressed in Ferrel's law.13.11.1. You must realize that the bubble sextant indicates the true vertical only when the instrument isat rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight line as perceived in space. If the earth were motionless,this  straight  path  in  space  would  also  be  a  straight  path  over  the  surface  of  the  earth;  conversely,  astraight path over the motionless earth would also be a straight path in space.13.11.2. When the aircraft is flying a path curved in space to the left, the fluid in the bubble chamber isdeflected to the right and the bubble is deflected to the left of the aircraft's path over the earth. When theaircraft is flying a curved path in space to the right, the reverse is true.13.11.3. In Figure 13.8, the aircraft is represented as flying on a curved path to the left. Note that in theinset representing the bubble chamber, the heavy black bubble is indicated in its approximate positionrepresenting the true vertical.Figure 13.8. Error Caused by Coriolis Force.288AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200113.11.4. The observer always seeks to center the bubble and, on this beam shot facing to the right side ofthe  aircraft  to  observe  the  body,  tip  the  sextant  up.  This  would  tilt  the  bubble  horizon  from  its  trueposition, producing a smaller sextant reading than the true value. The smaller the height observed (Ho),the greater the radius of the circle of equal altitude—the LOP will fall farther from the subpoint than thetrue LOP. Obviously, if the erroneous LOP falls farther from the subpoint, it will fall to the left of thetrue LOP and the correction to the right is valid. Corrections for Coriolis error are shown on the insideback cover of the Air Almanac as well as in all volumes of Pub. No. 249.13.11.5. Coriolis acceleration is directly proportional to the straight-line velocity, directly proportionalto the angular velocity of the earth, directly proportional to the sine of the latitude, and at right angles tothe direction of flight.13.12. Rhumb Line Error. The straight Coriolis table (Figure 13.9) found in the Air Almanac or Pub.No. 249 has a limited application. As long as a constant TH is flown, the path of the aircraft will be arhumb line. Because a rhumb line on the earth's surface is a curve, it is also a curved line in space. If theaircraft is headed in a general easterly direction in the Northern Hemisphere, the apparent curve is to theleft and becomes an addition to the Coriolis error. By the same token, if headed in a westerly direction inthe Northern Hemisphere, the apparent curve is to the right, or opposite that of Coriolis force as shownin Figure 13.10.13.12.1. There are notable exceptions to this. When flying north or south, the aircraft is flying a greatcircle and there is no rhumb line error. Also, when steering  by a free  running,  compensated  gyro, thetrack approximates a great circle and eliminates rhumb line error.Figure 13.9. Coriolis Correction.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001289Figure 13.10. Coriolis and/or Rhumb Line Errors in the Northern Hemisphere.13.12.2. At speeds under 300 knots, the error is negligible. However, at high speeds or high latitudes,rhumb line error is appreciable.  For example, at 60o  N  latitude  with  a  track  of  100o  and  a  GS  of  650knots,  the  Coriolis  correction  is  15  NM  right  and  the  rhumb  line  correction  is  10  NM  right.  Use  thefollowing  steps  and  Figure  13.11  to  determine  the  correction  for  rhumb  line  error  and  Corioliscorrection:13.12.2.1. Enter the nearest latitude on the left side. Interpolate if necessary.13.12.2.2. Enter the nearest track across the top of the chart. Interpolate if necessary.13.12.2.3. Choose the closest GS and extract the correction; that is, 50N, track 080o, GS 500 knots =14.3 Right.13.13.  Groundspeed  Acceleration  Error.  Changes  in  airspeed  or  wind  velocity  cause  this  error.Prevent changes of airspeed through good crew coordination.290AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 13.11. Combined Coriolis and Rhumb Line Correction.13.13.1. Changes in wind velocity with resultant changes in GS are more difficult to control. The changein GS will cause the liquid to be displaced, with the subsequent shifting of the bubble creating a falsehorizon. Notice in Figure 13.12 how the horizon is automatically displaced by keeping the bubble in thecenter while these changes are taking place. A very simple rule applies to acceleration and decelerationforces. If the aircraft accelerates while a celestial observation is in progress, the resultant LOP will fallahead of the actual position. Accelerate—Ahead. The more the LOP approaches a speed line, the greaterthe acceleration error will become. Refer to Figure 13.13:AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 13.12. Acceleration/Deceleration Errors.291Figure 13.13. Groundspeed Acceleration Error.29213.13.1.1. Enter with Zn-Track.13.13.1.2. Extract acceleration error and apply sign.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200113.13.2. Example: Track = 080o, Zn = 060o, Beginning GS – 500 knots, ending GS – 515 knots.060o – 080o = 340o = -1.40515 – 500 = 15 knots-1.40 x 15 = -21 correction to the Ho.13.14.  Wander  Error.  A  change  in  track  can  be  produced  by  changes  in  the  wind,  heading  changescaused by the autopilot or changing magnetic variation, or by heading changes caused by pilot manualsteering errors. As with the Coriolis force and rhumb line errors, correction tables have been developedfor wander error. Values extracted from the wander correction table, shown in Figure 13.14, are to beapplied  to  the  Ho.  Use  the  following  information  as  entering  arguments  for  the  determination  of  thecorrection taken from the table: (1) the heading at the beginning of the observation  was  079o,  (2)  theheading at the end of the observation was 081o, (3) the observation was taken over a 2-minute period, (4)the GS was 450 knots, and (5) the Zn of the body was 130o.Figure 13.14. Wander Correction Tables.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200129313.14.1. Following the instructions shown at the bottom of the table, enter the numerical portion of thetable with the values of GS and the change of track per 2 minutes. In this case, the GS is 450 knots andthe change in track per 2 minutes is 2o. Since the heading at the end of the observation is greater than theheading at the beginning, the change is 2o to the right. Notice that you must know whether the change isto the right or to the left to determine the sign of the correction. The factor obtained from the table is 12x 2 = 24.13.14.2. Next, enter the graph portion of the table with the value of the factor (24) and the value of theazimuth of the body minus the value of track. The graph is so constructed that it must be entered with Zn- Tr.  Zn - Tr  = 130o – 080o; so use 050o.  Following the  rules in steps two  and  three  in  the  table;  thecorrection is 19'. Since the change in track is to the right, the correction is subtracted from the Ho. Thisis determined by referring to the signs shown at the ends of the arc in the table. Figure 13.15 shows theeffect of this correction.13.14.3. If the track and groundspeed are the same at the beginning and the end of a shooting period,there will be no wander error.Figure 13.15. Wander Correction Applied to Ho.13.15. Instrument Error. Index error is usually the largest mechanical error in the sextant. This error iscaused by improper alignment of the index prism with the altitude counter. No matter how carefully asextant is handled, it is likely to have some  index  error.  If  the  error  is  small,  the  sextant  need  not  bereadjusted; rather, each Hs can be corrected by the amount of the error. This means that the index errorof the sextant must be known to obtain an accurate celestial  LOP. Another mechanical error found insextants is backlash. This is caused by excessive play in the gear train connecting the index prism to thealtitude counter.294AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200113.15.1. Usually, index and backlash errors are nearly constant through the altitude range of the sextant.Therefore, if the error at one altitude setting is determined, the correction can be applied to any Hs orHc. The correction is of equal value to the error but the opposite sign.13.15.2.  The  sextant  should  be  checked  on  the  ground  before  every  celestial  flight.  Preflighting  thesextant  can  determine  the  sextant  error  of  an  individual  instrument.  The  sextant  error  can  also  bedetermined  in-flight  and  a  correction  can  be  applied  to  the  precomp  to  compensate  for  the  error.  Todetermine the error and correction in-flight, one must have a celestial LOP, a Zn and the actual (or best-known) position of the aircraft at the same time. Refer to Figure 13.16.Figure 13.16. Determining Sextant Error Correction.13.15.3.  The  fix  symbol  represents  the  best-known  position  at  the  time  of  the  celestial  LOP.  Todetermine the actual value of the correction, measure the shortest distance between the position and theLOP. This tells you how many minutes of arc (NM) the Ho must be adjusted on subsequent shots to getan  accurate  LOP  (in  this  case,  the  value  is  10').  To  determine  whether  this  value  must  be  added  orsubtracted, note whether the LOP needs to be adjusted toward the Zn or away from the Zn. Rememberthe rule HOMOTO? It applies here, too.  If the  LOP needs to be moved toward the  Zn  in  order  to  bemade more accurate, the Ho needs to be made larger, thus the correction is added to the Ho to make theHo value increase. If the LOP needs to be moved away from the Zn, the correction will be subtractedfrom the Ho to make the Ho less. In Figure 13.16, the LOP needs to be moved 10 miles toward the Zn inorder to be accurate; thus, the sextant error correction is +10 to the Ho and can be used on subsequentshots obtained from the same sextant.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200129513.15.4. An important thing to remember is that the sextant error correction assumes conditions will beconsistent. As a technique, it is wise to obtain several LOPs with a sextant, noting the sextant errors oneach, before establishing a value to be carried on the precomp. Once using that correction, make sureyou use the same sextant.13.16. Summary. The first half of this chapter described the parts and operation of the sextant, and thesecond half explained sextant errors. Remember to apply parallax, semidiameter, and  refraction errorson every applicable shot. Corrections for acceleration errors can be applied only if you know the trackand groundspeed before and  after  each shot, so  be  aware  of  your  speed  and  direction  when  shooting.Time permitting, always try to evaluate the accuracy of your sextant on the ground.296AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Chapter 14GRID NAVIGATIONSection 14A— Introduction14.1. Basics. The original purpose of  grid  navigation  was  to  ease  the  difficulties  facing  the  navigatorduring high latitude flights. But grid can be used at all latitudes; particularly on long routes because griduses a great circle course for a heading reference. Grid is simply a reorientation of the heading reference,and does not alter standard fixing techniques.Section 14B— Problems Encountered in Polar Navigation14.2. Basics. Two factors peculiar to polar areas which make steering more difficult than usual are (1)magnetic compass unreliability and (2) geographic meridians converging at acute angles. The combinedeffect  of  these  two  factors  makes  steering  by  conventional  methods  difficult  if  not  impossible.  Eachfactor is examined below.14.3. Unreliability of Magnetic Compass. Maintaining an accurate heading in high latitudes is difficultwhen  a  magnetic  compass  is  used  as  the  heading  indicator.  Built  to  align  itself  with  the  horizontalcomponent  of  the  earth's  magnetic  field,  the  compass  instead  must  react  to  the  strong  verticalcomponent, which predominates near the magnetic poles. Here, the horizontal component is too weak toprovide  a  reliable  indication  of  direction.  As  a  result,  compass  performance  becomes  sluggish  andinaccurate.  The  situation  is  further  aggravated  by  the  frequent  magnetic  storms  in  the  polar  regions,which shift the magnetic lines of force.14.3.1. But even if these conditions did not exist, the mere proximity to the magnetic pole would sharplyreduce  compass usefulness. While the aircraft may fly a straight course, the  compass  indicator  wouldswing rapidly, faithfully pointing at a magnetic pole passing off to the left or right.14.3.2. To cope with the unreliable magnetic compass, we use gyro information for our heading inputs.14.4. Problem of Converging Meridians. The nature of the conventional geographic coordinate systemis such that all meridians converge to the pole. Each meridian represents a degree of longitude; each isaligned with true north and true south. On polar charts, the navigator encounters 1 degree of change intrue course for each meridian crossed; thus, the more closely the  aircraft approaches a pole, the morerapidly it crosses meridians. Even in straight-and-level flight along a great circle course, true course canchange several degrees over a short period of time. You are placed in the peculiar position of constantlyaltering the aircraft's magnetic heading in order to maintain a straight course. For precision navigation,such  a  procedure  is  clearly  out  of  the  question.  Notice  in  Figure  14.1  that  the  course  changes  60obetween  A  and  B  and  much  nearer  the  pole,  between  C  and  D,  it  changes  120o.  To  cope  with  theproblem of converging meridians, we will use the USAF Grid Overlay.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 14.1. Converging Meridians.29714.5. Grid Chart Projections. The three polar projections most commonly used in polar areas for gridnavigation are the transverse Mercator, the polar stereographic and the polar gnomonic. The transverseMercator  and  polar  stereographic  projections  are  used  in-flight,  the  polar  gnomonic  is  used  only  forplanning. The Lambert conformal projection is the one most commonly used for grid flight in subpolarareas. The division between polar and subpolar projections varies among the aeronautical chart series.For  example,  the  division  is  at  70o  of  latitude  for  the  JN  series  at  80o  of  latitude  for  the  OperationalNavigation Chart (ONC) series charts.Section 14C— USAF Grid Overlay14.6. Basics. The graticule of the USAF Grid Overlay eliminates the problem of converging meridians(Figure 14.2). It is a square grid and, though its meridians are aligned with grid north (GN) along theGreenwich meridian, they do not converge at GN. While the USAF Grid Overlay can be superimposedon any projection, it is most commonly used with the polar stereographic (for flights in polar areas) andthe Lambert conformal (for flights in subpolar areas). This is because a straight line on these projectionsapproximates  a  great  circle.  As  the  great  circle  course  crosses  the  true  meridians,  its  true  directionchanges but its grid direction remains constant (Figures 14.3 and 14.4). All grid meridians are parallel tothe Greenwich meridian and TN along the Greenwich meridian is the direction of GN over the entirechart.14.7. Relationship of Grid North (GN) to True North (TN). Because grid meridians are parallel to theGreenwich meridian, the aircraft longitude and the convergence factor (CF) of the chart govern the anglebetween GN and TN.298AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 14.2. USAF Grid Overlay.Figure 14.3. Great Circle True Direction Changes.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001299Figure 14.4. Great Circle True Direction Is Constant.14.7.1. CF of 1.0. Figure 14.5 shows that charts having CFs of 1.0 display GN to TN relationship as adirect function of longitude. In the Northern Hemisphere at 30o W, GN is 30o W of TN; at 60o W, GN is60o  W  of  TN.  Similarly,  at  130o  E  longitude,  GN  is  130o  E  of  TN.  In  the  Southern  Hemisphere,  thedirection of GN with respect to TN is exactly opposite.Figure 14.5. Correction for Moon's Parallax.14.7.2. CF of Less than 1.0. Figure 14.6 shows a chart with a CF of less than 1.0 with a USAF GridOverlay  superimposed  on  it.  The  relationship  between  GN  and  TN  on  this  chart  is  determined  in  thesame  manner  as  on  charts  with  a  CF  of  1.0.  On  charts  with  a  CF  of  less  than  1.0,  the  value  of  theconvergence angle at a given longitude is always smaller than the value of longitude and is equal to theCF times the aircraft longitude.300AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 14.6. Grid Overlay Superimposed on Lambert Conformal (Convergence Factor 0.785).14.8. Relationship of Grid Direction to True Direction. Use the following formulas to determine griddirection.In the Northern Hemisphere:Grid direction = true direction + west longitude x convergence factorGrid direction = true direction – east longitude x convergence factorIn the Southern Hemisphere:Grid direction = true direction – west longitude x convergence factorGrid direction = true direction + east longitude x convergence factor14.9. Polar Angle. Polar angle is used to relate true direction to grid direction. Polar angle is measuredclockwise through 360o  from GN to TN.  It is  simple  to  convert  from  one  directional  reference  to  theother by use of the formula grid direction = true direction + polar angle. To determine polar angle fromconvergence angle (CA), apply the following formulas.In the Northwest and Southeast Quadrants, Polar angle = convergence angleIn the Northeast and Southwest Quadrants, Polar angle = 360o – convergence angle14.10. Chart Transition. Since the relationship of the true meridians and the grid overlay on subpolarcharts  differs  from  that  on  polar  charts  because  of  different  CFs,  the  overlays  do  not  match  when  atransition is made from one chart to the other. Therefore, the grid course (GC) of a route on a subpolarchart will be different than the GC of the same route on a polar chart. The chart transition problem isbest solved during flight planning:14.10.1. Select a transition point common to both charts.14.10.2. Measure the subpolar GC and the polar GC.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200130114.10.3. Compute the difference between the GCs obtained in 14.10.2. This is the amount the compasspointer must be changed at the transition point. NOTE: If the GC on the first chart is smaller than theGC on the second chart, add the GC difference to the directional gyro (DG) reading and reposition theDG pointer; if the GC on the first chart is larger, subtract the GC difference.EXAMPLE: Chart transition from a subpolar to a polar chart. GC on subpolar chart is 316o. GC onpolar chart is 308o. GC difference is 8o. Gyro reading (grid heading [GH]) is 320o. The transition isfrom a larger GC to a smaller GC; therefore, the GC difference (8o) is subtracted from the GH valueread from the DG (320o). The DG pointer is then repositioned to the new GH (312o).Computed:Applied:From (subpolar) GCGC differenceTo (polar) GC316o  –8o308oOld (subpolar) GHGC differenceNew (polar) GH320o –8 o312oCAUTION: Do not alter the aircraft heading; instead, simply reposition the DG pointer to the new GH.14.11. Crossing 180th Meridian on Subpolar Chart. When a flight crosses the 180th meridian on asubpolar  grid  chart,  the  GH  changes  because  of  the  convergence  of  grid  meridians  along  this  truemeridian. This is very similar to the chart transition procedure described above. When using a subpolarchart that crosses the 180th meridian on an easterly heading (A to B in Figure  14.7), the  apical  anglemust  be  subtracted  from  the  GH.  Conversely,  the  apical  angle  must  be  added  to  the  GH  when  on  awesterly heading (B to A in Figure 14.7). The apical angle can be measured on the chart at the 180thmeridian  between  the  converging  GN  references.  The  angle  can  also  usually  be  found  on  the  chartborder, or computed by use of the following formula:Apical angle = 360o – (360o x convergence factor)EXAMPLE:Given:Find:Chart convergence factor 0.785Apical angleApical angle = 360o – (360o x 0.785)Apical angle = 360o – 283oApical angle = 77oCAUTION: Do not alter the aircraft heading when crossing the l80th meridian; instead, simply reset theDG pointer to the new GH.302AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 14.7. Crossing 180th Meridian on Subpolar Chart.14.12. Grivation. The difference between the directions of the magnetic lines of force and GN is calledgrivation (GV). GV is similar to variation and used to convert MH to GH and vice versa. Figure 14.8shows  the  relationship  between  GN,  TN,  and  MN.  Lines  of  equal  GV  (isogrivs)  are  plotted  on  gridcharts.Figure 14.8. Grivation.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200130314.12.1. The formulas for computing GV in the Northern Hemisphere are:GV = (–W conv angle) + W variationGV = (–W conv angle) – E variationGV = (+E conv angle) + W variationGV = (+E conv angle) – E variation14.12.2. If GV is positive, it is W grivation; if grivation is negative, it is E grivation. For example, ifvariation is 17o E and convergence angle is 76o W, using the formula:GV = (–West conv angle) + (–East variation)GV = (–76) + (–l7) = –93GV = 93o East14.12.3. To compute MH from GH, use the formula:MH = GH +W grivationMH = GH – E grivation14.12.4.  In  the  Southern  Hemisphere,  reverse  the  signs  of  west  and  east  convergence  angles  in  theformula above.Section 14D— Gyro Precession14.13. Basics. To eliminate the difficulties imposed by magnetic compass unreliability in polar  areas,you disregard the magnetic compass in favor of a free-running gyro. Gyro steering is used because it isstable and independent of magnetic influence. When used as a steering instrument, the gyro is restrictedso  its  spin  axis  always  remains  horizontal  to  the  surface  of  the  earth  and  is  free  to  turn  only  in  thishorizontal  plane.  Any  movement  of  a  gyro  spin  axis  from  its  initial  horizontal  alignment  is  calledprecession.  The  two  types  of  precession  are  real  and  apparent,  with  apparent  broken  into  earth  rate,transport, and grid transport precession. Total precession is the cumulative effect of real and apparentprecession.14.14. Real  Precession. Real  precession,  illustrated  in  Figure  14.9,  is  the  actual  movement  of  a  gyrospin  axis  from  its initial  alignment  in  space.  It  is  caused  by  such  imperfections  as  power  fluctuation,imbalance  of  the  gyro,  friction  in  gyro  gimbal  bearings,  and  acceleration  forces.  As  a  result  of  theimproved  quality  of  equipment  now  being  used,  real  precession  is  considered  to  be  negligible.  Somecompass systems have a real precession rate of less than 1o per hour. Electrical or mechanical forces areintentionally applied by erection or compensation devices to align the gyro spin axis in relation to theearth's surface. In this manner, the effects of apparent precession are eliminated and the gyro can then beused as a reliable reference.304Figure 14.9. Real Precession.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200114.15. Apparent Precession. The spin axis of a gyro remains aligned with a fixed point in space, whileyour plane of reference changes, making it appear that the spin axis has moved. Apparent precession isthis apparent movement of the gyro spin axis from its initial alignment.14.15.1. Earth Rate Precession. Earth rate precession is caused by the rotation of the earth while thespin axis of the gyro remains aligned with a fixed point in space. Earth rate precession is divided intotwo  components.  The  tendency  of  the  spin  axis  to  tilt  up  or  down  from  the  horizontal  plane  of  theobserver is called the vertical component. The tendency of the spin axis to drift around laterally; that is,to change in azimuth, is called the horizontal component. Generally, when earth rate is mentioned, it isthe horizontal component which is referred to, since the vertical component is of little concern.14.15.2.  Figure  14.10.  A  gyro  located  at  the  North  Pole,  with  its  spin  axis  initially  aligned  with  ameridian, appears to turn 15.04o per hour in the horizontal plane because the earth turns 15.04o per hour.As shown in A of Figure 14.10, the apparent relationship between the Greenwich meridian and the gyrospin axis will change by 90o in 6 hours, though the spin axis is still oriented to the same point in space.Thus, apparent precession at the pole equals the rate of earth rotation. At the equator, as shown in B ofFigure 14.10, no earth rate precession occurs in the horizontal plane if the gyro spin axis is still alignedwith a meridian and is parallel to the earth's spin axis.14.15.3. Vertical Component. When the gyro spin axis is turned perpendicular to the meridian (Figure14.11), maximum earth rate precession occurs in the vertical component. But the directional gyro doesnot precess vertically because of the internal restriction of the gyro movement in any but the horizontalplane.  Thus,  for  practical  purposes,  earth  rate  precession  is  only  that  precession  which  occurs  in  thehorizontal plane. Figure 14.11 illustrates earth rate precession at the equator for 6 hours of time.14.15.4. Precession Variation. Earth rate precession varies between 15.04o/hr at the poles and 0o/hr atthe  equator.  It  is  computed  for  any  latitude  by  multiplying  15.04o  times  the  sine  of  the  latitude.  Forexample,  at  30o  N,  the  sine  of  latitude  is  0.5.  The  horizontal  component  of  earth  rate  is,  therefore,15o/hour right x 0.5 or 7.5o/hour right at 30o N as shown in Figure 14.12.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001305Figure 14.10. Initial Location of Gyro Affects Earth Rate Precession.306AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 14.11. Direction of Spin Axis Affects Earth Rate Precession.Figure 14.12. Earth Precession Varies According to Latitude.14.15.5. Steering by Gyro. Obviously, if the gyro is precessing relative to the steering datum of GN orTN,  an  aircraft  steered  by  the  gyro  will  be  led  off  heading  at  the  same  rate.  To  compensate  for  thisprecession,  an  artificial  real  precession  is  induced  in  the  gyro  to  counteract  the  earth  rate.  At  30o  Nlatitude, earth rate precession is equal to 15o X sin lat = 15 X .5 or 7.5o per hour to the right.14.15.6. Offsetting Each Rate Effect. Hence, if at 30o N latitude, a real precession of 7.5o left per houris induced in the gyro, it will exactly balance and offset earth rate effect. In ordinary gyros, a weight isused to produce this effect but, since the rate is fixed for a given latitude, the correction is good for onlyAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001307one  latitude.  The  latitude  chosen  is  normally  the  mean  latitude  of  the  area  in  which  the  aircraft  willoperate. The N-1 and AHRS compass systems have a latitude setting knob, which you can use to adjustfor the earth rate corrections.14.16. Earth Transport Precession (Horizontal Plane). This form of apparent precession results fromtransporting a gyro from one point on the earth's surface to another. The gyro spin axis appears to movebecause the aircraft, flying over the curved surface of the  earth,  changes  its  attitude  in  relation  to  thegyro's fixed point in space (Figure 14.13). Earth transport precession causes the gyro spin axis to moveapproximately 1o in the horizontal plane for each true meridian crossed. This effect is avoided by usingGN as the steering reference.Figure 14.13. Earth Transport Precession.14.17. Grid Transport Precession. Grid transport precession exists because  meridian  convergence  isnot  precisely  portrayed  on  charts.  The  navigator  wants  to  maintain  a  straight-line  track,  but  the  gyrofollows a great-circle track, which is a curved line on a chart. The rate at which the great-circle trackcurves away from a straight-line track is grid transport precession. This is proportional to the differencebetween convergence of the meridians as they appear on the earth and as they appear on the chart andthe rate at which the aircraft crosses these meridians.14.18. Summary of Precession. Real precession is caused by friction in the gyro gimbal bearings anddynamic  unbalance.  It  is  an  unpredictable  quantity  and  can  be  measured  only  by  means  of  headingchecks.14.18.1. Earth rate precession is caused by the rotation of the earth. It can be computed in degrees perhour with the formula: 15.04 x sin lat. It is to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the308AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Southern Hemisphere. All gyros are corrected to some degree for this precession, many by means of alatitude setting knob.14.18.2.  Earth  transport  precession  (horizontal  plane)  is  an  effect  caused  by  using  TN  as  a  steeringreference.  It  can  be  computed  by  using  the  formula  (change  longitude/hr  x  sine  mid  latitude).  Thedirection of the precession is a function of the TC of the aircraft. If the course is 0o – 180o, precession isto the right; if the course is 180o – 360o, precession is to the left. This precession effect is avoided byusing GN as a steering reference.14.18.3. Grid transport precession is caused by the fact that the great circles are not portrayed as straightlines on plotting charts. The navigator tries to fly the straight pencil-line course, the gyro a great circlecourse. The formula for grid transport precession is change longitude/hr (sin lat-CF), where CF is thechart convergence factor. The direction of this precession is a function of the chart used the latitude andthe TC. Direct substitution into the formula will produce an answer valid for easterly courses, such as,0o–180o. For westerly courses, the sign of the answer must be reversed.14.19. Gyro Steering. Gyro steering is much the same as magnetic steering, except that  grid heading(GH) is used in place of true heading (TH). GH has the same relation to grid course (GC) as TH has totrue course (TC). The primary steering  gyro in most aircraft provides directional data to the  autopilotand  maintains  the  aircraft  on  a  preset  heading.  When  the  aircraft  alters  heading,  it  turns  about  theprimary gyro while the gyro spin axis remains fixed in azimuth. If the primary gyro precesses, it causesthe aircraft to change its heading by an amount equal to the precession.Section 14E— Starting a Grid Navigation Leg14.20.  Basics.  Grid  navigation  is  normally  entered  while  airborne  on  a  constant  heading.  A  constantheading is necessary because grid entry is accomplished by resetting the compass from a magnetic to agrid reference while on the same heading. After obtaining a grid celestial or INS heading check, resetthe compass immediately to the correct grid heading to avoid heading errors (because the precomputedgrid Zn is only good for shot time). Since the exact grid heading is set at the beginning of the navigationleg, precession is assumed to be zero until subsequent heading checks assess the accuracy of the gyro.The grid heading is normally obtained using a variant of the true heading method or the INS TH. Usingthis method, set a grid Zn in the sextant azimuth counter before collimating on the body. Other headingshot methods can be used, but would delay resetting the gyro to accomplish math computations after theheading shot. Although any  celestial body may be used, navigators commonly use the  sun  or  Polaris,depending on the time of day (Figure 14.14.)14.21. Using a Zn Graph. In order to get an accurate grid Zn for daytime grid entry, the navigator mustcompute Zn of the sun for a time and geographic position where the grid navigation leg will begin. If thegeographic  position  for  grid  entry  is  known  well  in  advance,  you  can  prepare  a  Zn  graph  for  a  timewindow.  A  Zn  graph  makes  grid  entry  easier  because  it  is  usable  for  an  extended  period  of  time,therefore  eliminating  the  need  to  precomp  for  a  specific  time.  The  graph  can  be  constructed  duringmission planning, thus reducing workload in the air.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 14.14. Grid Precomp.309310AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200114.21.1. To construct the graph, precomp and plot Zn on one axis and time on the other (Figure 14.15).Set up the time axis to cover the planned start time and several minutes earlier and later. Plot grid Zn onthe  other  axis  using  normal  precomp  procedures  and  the  start  point  coordinates.  Because  the  time/Znslope  is  close  to  linear,  precomping  at  20-30  minute  intervals  and  connecting  the  points  will  giveacceptable accuracy. When the sun is near local noon, precomp Zn  at closer intervals because the  Znchanges  rapidly.  To  use  the  graph  when  it  is  finished,  enter  on  the  time  axis.  Then  extend  a  lineperpendicular to the time axis until reaching the time/Zn line. Finally, read the appropriate Zn on the Znaxis.14.21.2. The sample in Figure 14.15 demonstrates using a graph to get a grid Zn for the time of 1700Z.Although  preparing  a  Zn  graph  takes  a  while,  it  pays  dividends  as  long  as  you  actually  fly  over  theplanned geographic point within the time frame covered by the graph.Figure 14.15. Zn Graph.14.22. Applying Precession to the DR. The most accurate method for applying precession to the DR isthe  "all  behind/half  ahead  method."  This  method  corrects  for  the  "banana"  effect  most  commonlyassociated with precession. Since the  full effect of precession does not occur  at one time, we have  toaccount for the gradual increase of precession.14.22.1. Step 1 — Determine the Hourly Rate. In Figure 14.16, grid entry occurred at 1700. At 1720,the navigator obtained a heading shot or MPP. The heading shot determined precession correction to be-2 and the compass was reset to the GH. On the MB-4 computer place the -2 correction on the outsidescale and the time since grid entry (20 minutes) on the inside scale. The hourly rate now appears abovethe index (6.0R). To minimize error the hourly rate has to be computed to the nearest tenth of a degree.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 14.16. Typical Mission In-Flight Log.31114.22.2. Step 2 — Compute "All Behind/Half Ahead." Since precession begins at the last time thegyro  was  reset,  for  this  example  we  need  to  start  at  grid  entry  1700.  At  1700  "all  behind"  would  bedetermined to be zero minutes and half-ahead to the next DR (1706) would be 3 minutes. To determinethe amount of precession correction to be used, leave the hourly rate (6.0) over the index and look above3 minutes. The computed precession correction for the 1706 DR is -0.3o or 0 for use on the log. Next weneed to determine the precession  correction  for  the  1720  DR.  At  1706,  "all  behind"  is  6  minutes  and"half ahead" is 7 minutes. The total time used to compute the precession correction for this DR is 13minutes. Again, using the hourly rate precession correction for the 1720 DR is -1.3o or -1o for the log.14.23. KC-135 Method. Since the "all behind/half ahead" method tends to keep  you behind, the KC-135  method  is  used  by  some  navigators  to  predict  precession.  This  method  basically  uses  half  of  thecomputed  precession  correction  for  future  DRs/MPPs  when  the  precession  correction  is  determinedbetween  two  positions.  Though  not  as  accurate  as  the  "all  behind/half  ahead"  method,  the  KC-135method can be effective if used with short DRs. Using the KC-135 method, compensate for precessionaround the turn by getting a heading shot immediately before and after the turn, resetting the gyro afterthe heading shot restarts precession.14.24. False Latitude. A second method of compensating for precession while in-flight involves the useof  false  latitude  inputs  into  the  gyro  compass.  Most  gyro  compasses  have  a  latitude  control,  whichallows the navigator to compensate for earth rate precession (ERP). Normally, the latitude control is setto the actual latitude of the aircraft. However, other values may be set. For example, if the aircraft is at30o N and the latitude control knob is set to 70o N, the gyro will overcorrect for ERP. Since ERP is rightin the Northern Hemisphere, the correction will be to the left. Thus, setting a higher than actual latitudewill correct for right precession over and above that for ERP. Since ERP 15o/hr X sine latitude, a tablesuch as Figure 14.17 can be developed to use this procedure.312AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 14.17. False Latitude Correction Table.14.25.  Summary.  The  USAF  Grid  Overlay  and  the  free-running  gyro  are  used  to  overcome  thedifficulties of converging meridians and the unreliability of the magnetic compass when navigating inhigh latitudes. When using gyro steering, maintain a record of the precession of both the primary andsecondary gyros. The gyro log provides you with the information necessary to predict values when it isimpossible to obtain heading checks because of overcast conditions or twilight. By maintaining a log onthe secondary gyro, the navigator can change gyros in case of malfunction of the primary gyro. Use theinformation recorded in the gyro log in conjunction with the navigator's log to plot position and computewinds, headings, alter headings, and ETAs. And never forget grid is green.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001313Chapter 15PRESSURE PATTERN NAVIGATIONSection 15A— Pressure Differential Techniques15.1.  Basics.  Pressure  differential  flying  is  based  on  a  mathematically  derived  formula.  The  formulapredicts  windflow  based  on  the  fact  that  air  moves  from  a  high  pressure  system  to  a  low  pressuresystem. This predicted windflow, the geostrophic wind, is the basis for pressure navigation. The formulafor the geostrophic wind (modified for a constant pressure surface) combined with in-flight informationmakes available two aids to navigation: Bellamy drift and the pressure line of position (PLOP). Bellamydrift gives information about aircraft track by supplying net drift over a set period of time. Using thesame basic information, the PLOP provides an LOP as valid as any other type.15.2.  Constant  Pressure  Surface.  To  understand  pressure  differential  navigation,  you  should  knowsomething  about  the  constant  pressure  surface.  The  constant  pressure  surface  is  one  on  which  thepressure is the same everywhere, even though its height above sea level will vary from point to point asshown in Figure 15.1. The pressure altimeter will show a constant reading. A constant pressure surfaceis shown on a constant pressure chart (CPC) as lines that connect points of equal height above sea level.These lines are referred to as contours (Figure 15.2) and are analogous to contour lines on land maps.The intersection of altitude MSL and constant pressure surfaces form isobars. A comparison of isobarsand contours is shown in Figure 15.2. The geostrophic wind will blow along and parallel to the contoursof a CPC just as it blows along and parallel to the isobars of a constant level chart.15.3. Geostrophic Wind. The shape and configuration of the constant pressure surface determine thevelocity and direction of the geostrophic wind. Flying with 29.92 set in the pressure altimeter will causethe  aircraft  to  follow  a  constant  pressure  surface  and  change  its  true  height  as  the  contours  change(Figure 15.3). The slope of the pressure surface, also known as the pressure gradient, is the difference inpressure per unit of distance as shown in Figure 15.4. The pressure gradient force (PGF) or slope of thepressure surface and Coriolis combine to produce the geostrophic wind. The speed of the geostrophicwind  is  proportional  to  the  spacing  of  the  contours  or  isobars.  Closely  spaced  contours  form  a  steepslope  and  produce  a  stronger  wind,  while  widely  spaced  contours  produce  relatively  weak  winds.According to Buys-Ballots Law, if you stand in the Northern Hemisphere with your back to the wind,the lower pressure is to your left (Figure 15.5). The opposite is true in the Southern Hemisphere whereCoriolis deflection is to the left. Further study of Figure 15.5 shows that as  you enter a low or a highsystem, your drift will be right or left, respectively. The opposite is true as you exit the system. Since thegeostrophic wind is based on a constant pressure surface, you must fly a constant pressure altitude. Aminimum of 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the surface will usually eliminate distortion introduced throughsurface  friction.  Near  the  equator  (20o  N  to  20o  S),  Coriolis  force  approaches  zero,  and  pressurenavigation is unreliable, pressure differential navigation is reliable in midlatitudes.314AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 15.1. Constant Pressure Surface.Figure 15.2. Contours.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001315Figure 15.3. Changing Contours of Constant Pressure Surface.Figure 15.4. Pressure Gradient.316Figure 15.5. Buys-Ballots Law.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200115.4.  Pressure  Computations  and  Plotting.  In  determining  a  PLOP  or  Bellamy  drift  by  pressuredifferential  techniques,  use  the  crosswind  component  of  the  geostrophic  wind  over  a  given  period  oftime. To determine your pressure pattern displacement (ZN), use the following equation:This formula gives the direction and crosswind displacement effect of the pressure system you've flownthrough.  To  solve  for  ZN,  you  must  understand  how  to  obtain  and  apply  such  special  factors  as  Dreadings, effective true airspeed (ETAS), effective airpath (EAP), effective air distance (EAD), and Kvalues.15.5. D Readings. The symbol D stands for the difference between the true altitude (TA) of the aircraftand the pressure altitude (PA) of the aircraft. There are two methods for obtaining D values. The firstuses an absolute altimeter to measure TA on overwater flights and the pressure altimeter to measure PA.The second method uses outside air temperature (OAT) readings to determine equivalent D values if theabsolute altimeter fails. For both methods, the D value is expressed in feet as a plus or minus value. Todetermine the correct D reading using the altimeter method, assign a plus (+) to TA, a minus (-) to PA,and algebraically add the two. Remember the city in Florida (TAMPA) to keep the signs right. Take thefirst D reading in conjunction with the initial fix for the pressure navigation leg. This is D1. Take thesecond reading (D2) at the next fix. Always take the readings at the same time relative to the fix (usuallyabout 4 minutes before fix time). The value, D2 – D1, is an expression of the slope or pressure gradientexperienced  by  the  aircraft.  Subtracting  D1  from  D2  determines  the  change  in  aircraft  TA  betweenreadings. When this altitude change is compared with the distance flown, the resulting value becomes anexpression of the slope. The value of D2 – D1 indicates whether the aircraft has been flying upslope (+)or downslope (-).AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200131715.5.1.  Take  readings  carefully,  because  an  erroneous  reading  of  either  altimeter  will  produce  anincorrect  D  reading  and  a  bad  LOP.  Gently  tap  the  pressure  altimeter  before  reading  it  to  reducehysteresis error.15.5.2. Maintain a constant PA to ensure consistent D readings. If you change altitudes, start with a newD at the new altitude, or correct the previous reading by use of a pastagram. The pastagram will allowyou  to  continue  accurately  even  though  you've  changed  altitude.  The  pastagram  uses  average  altitudeand  average  temperature  change  to  determine  a  correction  to  the  D  reading  taken  before  the  altitudechange. Figure 15.6 shows a pastagram with instructions for its use and a sample problem.15.6. Effective True Airspeed (ETAS). To determine a PLOP, you must compute the ETAS from thelast D reading. The ETAS is the TAS that the aircraft flew from the last fix to the next fix air position(Figure 15.7). If the aircraft has maintained a constant true heading (TH) between D readings, the ETASequals the average TAS. But, if the aircraft has altered heading substantially between the D readings, theeffective TAS is derived by drawing a straight line from the  fix  at  the  first  D  reading  to  the  final  airposition. This line is called the effective airpath (EAP). ETAS is computed by measuring the effectiveair distance (EAD) and dividing it by the elapsed time. In Figure 15.7, an aircraft flew at 400 knots TASfrom the 0820 fix to the 1020 air position via a dogleg route. The EAD is 516 NM; consequently, theETAS is 258 knots.15.7.  K  Factor.  The  constant  K  takes  into  account  Coriolis  and  the  gravity  constant  for  particularlatitudes.15.7.1. Midlatitude is the average latitude between D1 and D2. It is in tabular form in Figure 15.8. In thetable, this constant is plotted against latitude since Coriolis force varies with latitude. In using the ZNformula, enter the table with midlatitude and extract the corresponding K factor.318Figure 15.6. Pastagram.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 15.7. Effective True Airspeed.31915.7.2.  On  MB-4  computers,  a  subscale  of  latitude  appears  opposite  the  values  for  K  factors  on  theminutes scale. K is computed so that with slope expressed in feet and distance in NM, the geostrophicwindspeed is in knots. For training purposes only, the K factors for 20o N or S to 14o N or S are listed inFigure 15.9.15.8.  Crosswind  Displacement.  ZN  is  the  displacement  from  the  straight-line  airpath  between  thereadings.  Therefore,  a  PLOP  must  be  drawn  parallel  to  the  effective  airpath.  With  all  the  necessaryvalues  available,  the  ZN  formula  can  be  rearranged  for  convenient  solution  on  the  DR  computer  asfollows:Printed instructions on the face of MB-4 computers specify that to compute crosswind component, setEAD on the minutes scale opposite D2 - D1 on the miles scale. The crosswind component (V) is not to beconfused with ZN. The crosswind component (V) is crosswind velocity in knots. This component (V)must then be multiplied by the elapsed time between D2 and D1 in order to compute the ZN. SubstituteETAS for EAD on the MB-4 computer, and read the ZN over the K factor (or latitude on the subscale).320AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 15.8. Pressure Pattern Worksheet/K Factors Table.Figure 15.9. K Factors Table Below 20o.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200132115.9. Pressure Line of Position (PLOP). After you determine ZN, you need to figure out whether toplot  it  left  or  right  of  the  EAP.  Recall  that  wind  circulation  is  clockwise  around  a  high  andcounterclockwise  around  a  low  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere;  the  opposite  is  true  in  the  SouthernHemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, when the value of D increases (a positive D2 - D1), the aircraftis flying into an area of higher pressure and the drift is left. (Refer to A of Figure 15.10.) When the valueof D decreases (a negative D2 - D1), the aircraft is flying into an area of lower pressure and the drift isright  (B  of  Figure  15.10).  Use  the  memory  device  PLOP  to  remember  Plot  Left  On  Positive  (in  theNorthern hemisphere) Always plot the PLOP parallel to the EAP, as shown in Figure 15.11. Cross thePLOP with another LOP to form a fix, or use it with a DR position to construct an MPP.Figure 15.10. Pressure Pattern Displacement.15.10.  Bellamy  Drift.  Bellamy  drift  is  a  mean  drift  angle  calculated  for  a  past  period  of  time.  It  isnamed for Dr John Bellamy who first demonstrated that drift could be obtained from the use of pressuredifferential information. Bellamy drift is used in the same way as any other drift reading.15.10.1.  An  advantage  of  Bellamy  drift  is  its  independence  from  external  sources.  It  can  serve  as  abackup if the primary drift source fails, but will not give groundspeed. Bellamy drift is less accurate thanDoppler or INS derived sources, but is better than using forecast drift or having none at all.322AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200115.10.2. In Figure 15.12, a PLOP has been plotted from the following information:D1 at a fix at 1000 hrsD2 at an air position at 1045 hrsZn = - 20 NMConstant TH of 90oFigure 15.11. Plotting the PLOP.Figure 15.12. Solution of Bellamy Drift by Using PLOP.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200132315.10.3. Next, construct an MPP on the PLOP. This is done by swinging the arc, with a radius equal tothe  ground  distance  traveled,  from  the  fix  at  the  first  D  reading  to  intersect  the  PLOP.  The  grounddistance  traveled  can  be  found  by  multiplying  the  best  known  groundspeed  (groundspeed  by  timing,metro groundspeed,  etc.) by the time interval between readings. The mean  track  is  shown  by  the  linejoining D1 and the MPP. The mean drift is the angle between true heading and the mean track (8oR).Thus, the Bellamy drift is 8o right.15.11.  MB-4  Solution  of  Bellamy  Drift.  Compute  Bellamy  drift  on  the  slide  rule  side  of  the  DRcomputer by placing the ZN over the ground distance and reading the Bellamy drift angle opposite 57.3(Figures 15.13 and 15.14). This can be set up in a formula as follows:EXAMPLE:Given:ZN = +12.1Time = 0:30GS = 190 KnotsFind:Ground Distance = 95NMDrift = 7o leftFigure 15.13. Computer Solution of Bellamy Drift.324AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 15.14. Mathematical Solution of Bellamy Drift.Section 15B— Limitations of Pressure Differential Techniques15.12.  Limitations.  Pressure  navigation  is  limited  by  a  few  meteorological  considerations.  The  basicaccuracy of the LOP in average conditions is about 5 to 10 miles. It will rapidly become worse under thefollowing conditions: tightly circulating pressure systems of highs and lows, flying through a front, orcarelessness in reading or computing the information. Bellamy drift has another limitation. To determinedrift you must stay on one heading long enough to take two readings about 20 minutes apart.15.13. Summary. ZN is a displacement in NM perpendicular to the EAP. Compute  ZN on the MB-4using the equation:Determine  ETAS  by  using  the  EAD  and  time.  Measure  EAD  along  a  straight  line  between  the  twopoints in question. In the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, the sign of the ZN is the sign of the driftcorrection.  Use  airplot  in  conjunction  with  a  fix  position  to  plot  the  PLOP,  and  plot  it  parallel  to  theEAP.  If  the  absolute  altimeter  fails,  use  pressure  by  temperature  as  a  backup.  With  this  method,  usetemperature and pressure altitude to find equivalent D readings. If you change altitudes, restart pressureat the new altitude, or correct the last D reading prior to the altitude change with a pastagram. Anotherexpression of the PLOP is Bellamy drift, used as a backup source of drift angle. Figure 15.15 shows afix determined by a PLOP and a celestial LOP.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001325Figure 15.15.

Navigation systems are computer systems that determine position and calculate navigationinformation.  They  free  the  operator  from  the  intense  mathematical  calculations  characteristic  of  DRnavigation to allow additional time for military related activities. Simple navigation systems rely on aninitial  position  and  basic  instrument  data,  like  doppler  groundspeed  and  drift,  magnetic  heading,  andvariation,  to  compute  and  constantly  update  the  DR  position.  These  systems  require  the  operator  tospend  time  to  maintain  system  accuracy.  Complex  systems  integrate  information  from  a  variety  ofsources using complex statistical algorithms to produce constantly updated, highly accurate position andnavigation  information.  Some  components  of  a  navigation  system  may  be  stand-alone  systems.  Thischapter  examines  navigation  systems  in  general  and  the  most  common  systems  in  detail—InertialNavigation Systems (INS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS).Section 16B— Navigation Systems16.2.  Basics.  In  the  same  way  an  autopilot  frees  a  pilot  from  the  manual  operations  of  flying,  anavigation system relieves you of many manual operations required to direct the aircraft. When sensorsare tied into a navigation system, the system automatically uses their data to compute present positionfor the navigator.  This reduces the workload and frees  you to make the decisions that are beyond thecapability  of  computers  and  more  effectively  employ  the  weapon  system.  During  a  flight  from  theUnited States to a foreign country, the aircraft may pass over areas of land, water, and icecaps. You mayhave  to  deal  with  conditions  of  overcast,  undercast,  day,  night,  altitude  changes,  turn  points,  and  airtraffic  requirements  in  addition  to  weapon  system  employment.  To  handle  these  conditions  at  highspeeds more effectively, the navigator uses a navigation system.16.3. Types of Systems. Navigation systems can be classified according to many criteria. Systems canbe classified by capability such as VFR-only or all-weather. They can be classified by mission type suchas  ground-attack,  air-to-air,  or  combat  support.  They  can  be  classified  as  either  self-contained  orexternally-referenced. They may also be classified as to whether they emit signals or are passive. Eachsystem  has  advantages  and  disadvantages,  but  we  will  confine  this  discussion  to  self-contained  andexternally referenced systems.16.3.1. Self-Contained Navigation Systems. Self-contained systems (radar, celestial, INS) are completein that and they do not depend upon externally transmitted data. Weapon systems equipped with self-contained navigation systems can operate anywhere in the  world without the assistance  of  ground-  orspace-based transmitters.16.3.2.  Externally-Referenced  Navigation  Systems.  Externally-referenced  aids  (GPS,  NAVAIDs)include all aids that depend upon transmission of energy or information from an external source to theaircraft. Externally-referenced navigation systems provide information to anyone, which in time of warincludes the enemy as well as friendly forces. Another disadvantage of externally-referenced aids is theirvulnerability  to  attack,  jamming,  or  exploitation.  While  externally  referenced  aids  have  enormousinstallation  and  operating  costs  to  the  system  administrator,  they  have  much  lower  equipment  andmaintenance costs to the user.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200132716.4.  The  Ideal  System.  Every  navigation  system  has  certain  advantages  and  disadvantages.  Aparticular  navigation  system  is  selected  for  use  in  an  aircraft  when  its  advantages  outweigh  itsdisadvantages.  In  some  cases,  several  components  are  included  in  a  system  to  provide  adequate,redundant information for all possible mission taskings. The ultimate navigation system should have thefollowing characteristics:16.4.1. Groundplot DR Information. The system must indicate the position and velocity relative to theground.16.4.2. Global Coverage. Capable of positioning and steering the aircraft  accurately and reliably  anyplace in the world.16.4.3. Self-Contained. It must not rely on ground or space transmissions of any kind.16.4.4. Passive Operation. It must not betray the position of the aircraft by transmitting signals of anykind.16.4.5. Immune to Countermeasures. The system must not be susceptible to countermeasures of anytype.16.4.6.  Useless  to  Enemy.  It  must  not  provide  navigation  information  or  intelligence  of  any  kind  toenemy forces.16.4.7. Flexible. Works well despite unplanned deviations. The system must work well at all altitudesand speeds.16.5.  Components.  The  navigational  system  consists  of  three  parts:  (1)  the  computer  or  centralprocessing  unit  (CPU),  (2)  data-gathering  sensors  like  astrotrackers,  GPS,  ground  mapping  radar,  orNAVAIDS;  and  (3)  an  operator  input/output  (I/O)  interface.  The  CPU  takes  in  all  available  data  andconverts it into usable navigation information. Control panels or computer keyboards allow the operatorto control and make inputs to the computer. Data is displayed for the operator on display panels, radarscreens,  or  computer  screens.  Additional  software  components  might  be  capable  of  air-to-grounddelivery,  air-to-air  intercepts,  weapons  employment,  threat  avoidance,  and  rendezvous.  Additionalhardware  components  could  include  terrain  following  radar,  television  cameras,  or  threat  detectionreceivers.16.6. Computer Unit. Most navigation systems are hybrids of the two basic computer types: analog anddigital.16.6.1.  Analog.  Analog  computers  are  more  specific  in  design  and  function  than  digital  computers.While analog computers process vast amounts of similar data they are not very flexible and cannot beused for multiple purposes. Radar scan converters efficiently process collected radar signals into videoimages.  Video  processors  collect  and  process  images  into  video  displays.  Other  examples  of  analogcomputers are terrain-avoidance computers and terrain-following computers.16.6.2.  Digital.  Digital  computers  are  lighter  and  more  compact  than  analog  computers.  Hand-heldcalculators  and  laptop  computers  are  two  examples  of  the  miniaturization  possible  with  digitalcomputers. You can put a great deal of computing power  and capability into a small box; the biggest328AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001limitation is increased cost. An analog radar scan converter is very efficient at processing radar data, butit  cannot  be  used  for  other  applications.  On  the  other  hand,  digital  computers  can  be  loaded  withnavigation  software,  aerial  delivery  software,  and  diagnostic  programs.  These  computers  canmathematically  manipulate  data  in  any  way  imaginable  because  they  deal  strictly  with  digitalinformation. The output from digital computers may need to be converted into an analog format for mostefficient use by the navigator, however; the digital computer cannot do that. It  can display the digitaldata  in  an  approximation  of  analog  data.  While  a  digital  computer  can  perform  any  mathematicalfunction,  it  must  first  be  programmed  for  that  function.  In-flight  reprogramming  is  not  generallypossible.16.7. Sensors. Many types of sensors are used for inputs to navigation systems.16.7.1. Astrotracker. The use of astrotrackers has decreased; however, they are still excellent sourcesof  position  information.  They  automatically  track  celestial  bodies  and  compute  position  informationusing celestial techniques. They are passive but require clear skies.16.7.2. Doppler. The doppler radar measures GS and drift. These two data inputs can be put to severaluses in the computer system. Doppler GS is used to determine distance to update the aircraft position.Drift can be used to compute winds and aircraft track. Doppler outputs can be used in platform levelingand  verifying  inertial  GS  in  an  inertial  navigation  system.  Doppler  radar  is  an  essential  part  of  manynavigation computer systems.16.7.3. Heading System. The gyro-stabilized magnetic heading source is corrected to true heading withthe  local  magnetic  variation.  This  can  be  applied  manually  or  automatically  from  a  database  in  thecomputer. Magnetic or true course can be calculated by applying doppler or inertial drift.16.7.4. NAVAIDS. NAVAIDS are easily added to a computer system. VOR or TACAN bearings andDME provide the same information as a radar fix. The computer needs the location and frequency of thetransmitter, which can be programmed into the computer before the mission begins. Some correctionsmust be applied to bearing data. The computer must correct for magnetic variation and slant range fromthe station to the aircraft.16.7.5.  Pressure  Altimeter.  Pressure  altimeter  data  is  an  input  to  the  true  airspeed  computations.Additionally it can be used with temperature data to compute true altitude.16.7.6.  Radar.  When  a  ground  mapping  radar  is  incorporated  into  the  navigation  system,  presentposition can be corrected based on the measurements to surveyed radar returns. The operator identifiesradar  returns  on  his  radar  scope  and  measures  the  range  and  bearing  to  the  return.  The  operatordetermines  the  aircraft  position  relative  to  the  return  and  updates  the  aircraft  position.  Automaticsystems allows the operator to pre-load the coordinates of radar returns in a database, place a movableelectronic  cursor (or crosshairs) on the return, and  push  a  button  to  update  the  system.  The  computerdetermines the distance and bearing from the aircraft to the set coordinates. The computer then generatesthe cursor on the radarscope at the calculated range and bearing. If there is any error in the navigationsystem position, the cursor will not fall on the radar return. The operator adjusts the cursor or crosshairsonto the radar return. The operator pushes a button to automatically update the system.16.7.7.  Temperature  Sensors.  The  air  data  computer  uses  the  information  collected  by  temperaturesensors. Temperature gradients can be used with pressure altimeter data to compute true altitude.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200132916.7.8.  True  Airspeed.  True  airspeed  can  be  calculated  from  indicated  airspeed,  temperature,  andpressure. True airspeed and winds can be used as a backup for cross-checking ground speed.16.7.9. Independent Systems. INS and GPS can also act as sensors for a navigation system. They arediscussed in greater detail later in this chapter.16.8.  Determining  Position.  The  ever-present  problem  facing  the  navigator  is  determining  aircraftposition. With a navigation system this problem is solved because the computer converts input data intoa  constantly  updated  present  position  for  the  aircraft.  Advanced  systems  provide  altitude,  attitude,heading, and velocity information.16.8.1. The mathematics of navigation over the surface of a sphere has been known for several centuries.Starting  from  an  initial  position  the  computer  determines  the  distance  and  direction  traveled  sincestarting navigation. Aircraft direction, or track, may be supplied by INS, GPS, or the heading referencesystem in combination with doppler drift. Ground speed may come from INS, GPS, or doppler groundspeed,  or  may  be  determined  from  any  NAVAID  capable  of  range  and  bearing  fixes.  The  computermultiplies  speed  against  time  interval  to  determine  distance  traveled.  Distance  is  projected  along  theaircraft track to obtain the new position. Track and speed are sampled and present position is updatedmany times per second. Waypoint navigation is a simple addition to the navigation computer.16.8.2. A database of coordinates can be added to the system to determine distance to go and estimatedtime of arrival. If the aircraft changes speed, the  ETA is automatically updated using the new  groundspeed.16.9.  Decision  Algorithm.  Simple  navigation  systems  determine  position  as  described  above.  Theoperator  updates  the  position  for  errors  that  will  eventually  occur.  More  complex  systems  haveadditional problems. When a system has a variety of sources that provides redundant information, howdoes the computer decide which source to use? What if the sensors are subject to errors? What if theoperator  inputs  an  inaccurate  update  to  the  system?  How  can  we  get  a  computer  to  make  simpledecisions  once  left  to  the  navigator?  Can  we  program  a  computer  to  analyze  and  correct  for  thepredictable and unpredictable errors in sensor data? Bias in the accuracy and variability of data are twotypes of error that navigation systems actually experience and can be solved with the use of statisticalsoftware called decision algorithms.16.9.1.  To  compensate  for  these  predictable  and  unpredictable  errors  in  sensor  data,  we  can  includestatistical measuring software that will weigh the accuracy of each data source and the accuracy of thedata  itself.  These  programs  will  determine  the  most  likely  value  for  track  and  velocity  in  order  tocompute the most likely present position.16.9.2. One type of program used to determine the most likely sensor values is called a Kalman filter.Kalman filters are used extensively in computer controlled communications, electronics, and equipment.When  used  as  part  of  a  navigation  system,  a  Kalman  filter  computes  the  most  likely  position  of  theaircraft and updates the weighing factors with each new position update. The Kalman filter compares theactual sensor data used prior to the update with the data from the update. By comparing the first positionwith the second position, actual distance and heading can be determined. It then determines the amountof error in the original data and estimates a correction to the data for the next time period. The Kalmanfilter  is  an  iterative  program  requiring  several  updates  prior  to  achieving  completely  reliable  data.  Ifused, the Kalman filter  will also be used to  evaluate  the  reliability  of  operator  inputs  and  weigh  how330AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001much  of  each  position  update  to  accept.  Kalman  filtering  provides  increased  reliability  in  navigationsystems so an operator can trust that the information used is valid. Kalman filters protect the operatorfrom inaccurate sensor data and even operator error.Section 16C— Inertial Navigation System (INS)is  completely 16.10.  Basics.  Inertial  navigation  is  accepted  as  an  ideal  navigation  system  because  it  meets  all  thecriteria of an ideal system. INS provides worldwide ground plot information regardless of flight path andaircraft performance. An INS can measure GS independently of wind and independently of the operatingenvironment.  INS to  enemycountermeasures, and passive in operation. It is self-contained and portable; most units weigh less than100 pounds. Some ring laser gyro systems weigh as little as 20 pounds. The need for a system with theseproperties has spurred development to the point where INS is superior to almost every other navigationsystem.  INS  provides  accurate  velocity  information  instantaneously  for  all  maneuvers,  as  well  as  anaccurate attitude and heading reference.  INS accuracy decreases  as the time between position updatesincreases.  INS  will  maintain  its  accuracy  for  short  sorties  without  position  updates;  however,  longersorties may require periodic in-flight updates.independent  of  ground transmissions, immune 16.11. Types of Inertial Systems. In the last several years inertial technology has taken several leapsforward. Early inertials were bulky devices weighing several hundred pounds, whose installation had tobe precise and whose operation had to be planned in great detail. Today there are compact systems thatfit in a briefcase and can be bolted to an aircraft in any space available. While some inertial systems stillhave  mechanical  gyroscopes,  pendulous  linear  accelerometers,  and  space  stable  platforms,  most  haveevolved  to  keep  pace  with  the  advances  in  technology.  Acoustic  gyros,  ring  laser  gyros,  andelectronically  suspended  gyros  have  replaced the  gimbaled  gyroscope.  Laser  and  acousticaccelerometers  are  replacing  the  pendulous  linear  accelerometer.  Highly  accurate  computers  andprecision  sensors  have  led  to  modifications  of  the  space  stable  platform  so  the  INS  housing  does  notneed to be accurately aligned with the aircraft. Eventually software will perform all the functions of thespace  stable  platform.  Despite  all  these  modern  advances,  we  can  better  learn  about  and  understandinertial systems by studying the original systems.16.12.  Principles.  The  basic  principle  behind  inertial  navigation  is  straightforward.  Starting  from  aknown point,  you calculate  your present position (a  continuously running DR)  from the direction andspeed  traveled  since  starting  navigation.  The  difference  between  other  navigation  systems  and  INS  ishow  it  determines  direction,  distances,  and  velocities.  Accelerations  are  detected  by  the  three  linearaccelerometers. These accelerations are integrated over time to determine changes in velocity. Velocityis integrated a second time to determine distance traveled. Changes in vector direction are detected withangular  accelerometers.  As  sensors  detect  changes  in  gyroscope  orientation,  correction  signals  aregenerated to reorient the stable platform to the original position and determine new vector direction. INSrequires no other inputs. It avoids all environmental inputs such as indicated or true airspeed, magneticheading, drift, and winds that are necessary for dead reckoning.16.13. Components. The five basic components of an INS are:16.13.1. Three linear accelerometers arranged orthogonally to supply the x, y, and z axis components ofacceleration.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200133116.13.2.  Gyroscopes  to  measure  and  use  changes  in  aircraft  vector  to  maintain  and  orient  the  stableplatform.16.13.3. A stable platform oriented to keep the x and y axis linear accelerometers oriented north-southand east-west to provide azimuth orientation and to keep the z axis aligned with the local gravity vector.The stable platform is necessary to prevent either the x or y axis accelerometer from picking up the forceof gravity and interpreting it as an acceleration on the aircraft.16.13.4. Integrators to convert raw acceleration data into velocity and distance data.16.13.5. A computer to continuously calculate position information.16.14. Linear Accelerometers. Acceleration-measuring devices are the heart of all inertial systems. It isimportant that they function reliably for all maneuvers within the capability of the aircraft, and that allpossible  sources  of  error  are  minimized.  Very  slight  accelerations  and  changes  in  heading  in  alldirections must be detected. Changes in temperature and pressure must not affect INS operation. To dothis,  INS  requires  two  types  of  accelerometers,  linear  and  angular.  The  simplest  type  of  linearaccelerometer consists of a pendulous mass that is free to  rotate  about  a  pivot  axis  in  the  instrument.There is an electrical pickoff that converts the rotation of the pendulous mass about its pivot axis into anoutput signal. This output signal is used to torque the pendulum to hold it in the original position and,since the signal is proportional to the measured acceleration, it is sent to the navigation computer as anacceleration output signal (Figure 16.1). To obtain acceleration in all directions, three accelerometers aremounted mutually perpendicular in a fixed orientation. To convert acceleration into useful information,the  acceleration  signals  must  be  integrated  to  produce  velocity  and  then  the  velocity  information  isintegrated  to  get  the  distance  traveled.  One  of  the  forces  measured  by  the  linear  accelerometers  isgravity. This acceleration may be incorrectly interpreted as an acceleration of the aircraft if the stabilizedplatform  is  tilted  relative  to  the  local  gravity  vector.  The  accelerometers  cannot  distinguish  betweenactual  acceleration  and  the  force  of  gravity.  This  means  that  the  linear  accelerometers  on  the  stableplatform must be kept level relative to the earth's surface (perpendicular to the local gravity vector). Thegyroscopes keep the stabilized platform and the accelerometers level and oriented in a north-south andeast-west direction.Figure 16.1. A Basic Inertial System.332AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200116.15.  Gyroscopes.  Gyroscopes  are  used  in  inertial  systems  to  measure  angular  acceleration  andchanges in orientation and heading. While the types of gyros are briefly discussed here, the function ofthe gyro is  discussed  in  great  detail  in  the  next  section  on  the  stable  platform.  The  original  gimbaledgyroscope has been replaced by newer designs.16.15.1. Electronically Suspended Gyros. These gimbal-less gyros consist of a ball that is suspendedin a magnetic field and spun electronically. Evacuating the air in the gyro cavity further reduces friction.The result is a near frictionless gyro with precession rates measured in years. Optical sensors measurethe ball's orientation from symbols etched on the surface of the ball.16.15.2.  Ring  Laser  Gyro.  Accuracy  and  dependability  of  first  generation  systems  have  greatlyimproved  with  the  introduction  of  the  ring  laser  gyro  (RLG)  INS.  The  RLG  INS  replaces  the  threependulous mass accelerometers with three RLG accelerometers. Technically the RLG is not a gyroscopesince it has no moving parts, but it gives the same information as a gyro. A RLG is made from a singleblock of glass with three holes drilled through the glass to form a triangular path. Two of the openingsare plugged with mirrors and the triangular tube is filled with helium neon or other lazing gas. When thegas is charged, the lazing  gas produces two  counter-rotating laser beams that are reflected around thepath by the mirrors. Both laser beams emerge through the third hole in the glass and are superimposedupon each other to produce an interference pattern. As the RLG moves, one beam has a longer path totravel; the other a shorter path. This causes changes in the interference pattern, which are detected byphotocells. The angular rate and direction of motion are computed as accelerations.16.15.3. Acoustic Gyros. Another  recent development is the inertial sensor based on vibrating quartzcrystal  technology.  Like  the  RLG,  these  are  not  true  gyros.  Acoustic  gyros  are  manufactured  from  asingle piece of microminiature quartz rate sensor. Angular accelerations affect the patterns produced bya vibrating tuning fork and result in torque on the fork proportional to the angular acceleration. Thesegyros appeared in inertial units in the late 1990s.16.16. Stable Platform. Stable platforms have been used for years in bombing and fire control systems.Autopilots  and  attitude  indicators  use  gyrostabilized  platforms.  Inertial  navigation  simply  requires  astable  platform  with  higher  specifications  of  accuracy.  A  gyro-stabilized  platform  on  whichaccelerometers are mounted is called a stable element. It is isolated from the aircraft's angular motionsby  three  concentric  gimbals.  The  stable  element  is  the  mounting  for  the  linear  accelerometers,gyroscopes, and other supporting equipment. The supporting equipment includes torque motors, servomotors, pickoffs, amplifiers, and  wiring.  The effectiveness of the stable platform is  determined  by  allparts of the platform, not just the accelerometers and gyros.16.16.1.  The  linear  accelerometers  measure  acceleration  in  all  directions  and  the  gyros  control  theorientation of the platform. The platform must contain at least two gyros with two degrees of freedom. Asimple diagram of a two-degrees-of-freedom gyro mounted on a single-axis platform is shown in Figure16.2.  If  one-degree-of-freedom  rate  gyros  are  used,  three  units  are  needed,  each  gyro  having  its  ownindependent  feedback  and  control  loop.  The  original  gimbaled  gyro  was  not  very  accurate  by  today'sstandards, producing sizeable amounts of gyroscopic precession. Recent developments such as the air-bearing  gyro  and  the  electronically  suspended  gyro  have  only  1/10,000,000  the  friction  of  a  standardgyro  and  negligible  real  precession.  Today's  gyros  have  real  precession  rates  of  less  than  360°  in  30years.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 16.2. Stable Platform.33316.16.2. The desired property of a gyro that we want to capitalize on is its stability in space. A spinninggyro  tends  to  remain  in  its  original  position.  A  free  spinning  gyro  aligned  in  space  tends  to  remainpointed in the same direction unless a  force acts on  it.  On  a  stable  platform,  any  displacement  of  thestable element from its frame of reference is sensed by the electrical pickoffs in the gyroscopes. Theseelectrical signals are amplified and used to drive the platform gimbals to realign the stable element in theoriginal position. More advanced INS have a four-gimbal platform in a three-axis configuration (Figure16.3).Figure 16.3. Gimbal Platform.16.16.3. The four-gimbal mounting provides a full 360° freedom of rotation about the stable  element,thus allowing it to remain level with respect to local gravity and to remain oriented to true north. This isnorth as established by the gyros and accelerometers, regardless of the in-flight attitude of the aircraft.The azimuth, pitch, and outer roll gimbals have a 360° freedom of rotation about their own individualaxis. The fourth or inner roll gimbal has stops limiting its rotation about its axis. This gimbal is provided334AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001to prevent gimbal lock, which is a condition that causes the stable element to tumble. Gimbal lock canoccur during flight maneuvers, such as a loop, when two of the gimbal axes become aligned parallel toeach other, causing the stable element to lose one of its degrees of freedom.16.17.  Measuring  Horizontal  Acceleration.  The  key  to  a  successful  inertial  system  is  absoluteaccuracy  in  measuring  horizontal  accelerations.  A  slight  tilt  of  the  stable  platform  will  introduce  acomponent  of  earth's  gravity  as  acceleration  on  the  aircraft  and  will  result  in  incorrect  distances  andvelocities  (Figure  16.4).  Keeping  the  accelerometers  level  is  the  job  of  the  feedback  circuit.  Thecomputer  calculates  distance  traveled  along  the  surface  of  the  earth  and  moves  the  accelerometerthrough an equivalent arc. Several factors affect aligning the accelerometer using this method. The earthis not a sphere, but an oblate spheroid or geoid. Because the earth is not a smooth surface, there are localdeviations in the direction of gravity. The feedback circuit operates on the premise that the arc traversedis proportional to distance traveled. Actually, the arc varies considerably because of the earth's shape;the variation is greatest at the poles. The computer must solve for this irregularity in converting distanceto arc.Figure 16.4. Effect of Accelerometer Tilt.16.17.1. The accelerometers are kept level relative to astronomical rather than geocentric latitude. Usingthe astronomical latitude, the accelerometers are kept aligned with the local horizon and also with theearth's  gravitational  field.  Feedback  from  the  computer  keeps  the  accelerometers  level,  correcting  fortwo types of apparent precession. If the inertial unit were stationary at the equator, it would be necessaryto  rotate  the  accelerometers  to  maintain  them  level  because  of  the  earth's  angular  rotation  of  15°  perhour. Also, movement of the stabilized platform would require corrections to keep the accelerometerslevel. When using a local horizontal system, in which the accelerometers are maintained directly on thegyro platform, the gyro platform must be torqued by a signal from the computer to keep the platformhorizontal. Apparent precession is illustrated in Figure 16.5.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 16.5. Apparent Precession.33516.17.2. A slight error in maintaining the horizontal would induce a major error in distance computation.If an accelerometer picked up an error signal of 1/100 of the G-force, the error on a 1-hour flight wouldbe 208,000 feet (over 34 NM). In 1923, Dr Maxmillian Schuler showed a pendulum with a period of84.4 minutes could solve the problem of eliminating inadvertent acceleration errors.16.17.3.  If  a  pendulum  has  a  period  of  84.4  minutes,  it  will  indicate  the  vertical,  regardless  ofacceleration of the vehicle. He demonstrated that a device with a period of 84.4 minutes would remainvertical to the horizon despite  any  acceleration  on  the  device.  The  fundamental  principle  of  the  84.4-minute theorem is that if a pendulum had an arm equal in length to the radius of the earth, gravity wouldhave no effect on the bob. This is because the center of the bob would be at the center of gravity of theearth and the pendulum arm would always remain vertical for all motions of the pivot point. While itwould be impossible to construct this pendulum, devices with an 84.4-minute cycle can be constructedusing gyroscopes. The Schuler pendulum phenomenon prevents the accumulation of errors which wouldbe caused by  platform tilt and treating  gravity  as an acceleration.  It will not  compensate  for  errors  inazimuth resulting from the precession of the steering gyro. The amplitude of the Schuler cycle dependsupon the overall accuracy of the system. Figure 16.6 shows the Schuler-tuned system.336AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 16.6. Schuler Pendulum Phenomenon.16.17.4.  A  spinning,  untorqued  gyro  is  space-oriented  and  will  appear  to  move  as  the  earth  rotatesunderneath  it.  This  is  undesirable  for  older  systems  because  the  accelerometers  will  not  be  keptperpendicular to the local vertical. To earth-orient the gyro, we control apparent precession. If a force isapplied to the axis of a spinning gyro wheel that is free to move in a gimballing structure, the wheel willmove  in  a  direction  at  right  angles  to  the  applied  force.  This  is  called  torquing  a  gyro  and  can  beconsidered as mechanized or induced precession. A continuous torque, applied to the appropriate axis byelectromagnetic elements called torques, reorients the gyro wheel to maintain the stable element levelwith respect to the earth, and keeps it pointed north. An analog or digital computer determines the torqueto  be  applied  to  the  gyros  through  a  loop  that  is  tuned  using  the  Schuler  pendulum  principle.  Thenecessary correction for earth rate depends on the position of the aircraft; the correction to be appliedabout the vertical axis depends on the velocity of the aircraft.16.17.5. It is important that the stable element be accurately leveled with respect to the local vertical andaligned  in  azimuth  with  respect  to  true  north.  Precise  leveling  of  the  stable  element  is  accomplishedprior  to  flight  by  the  accelerometers  that  measure  acceleration  in  the  horizontal  plane.  The  stableelement  is  moved  until  the  output  of  the  x  and  y  accelerometers  is  zero,  indicating  that  they  are  notmeasuring  any  component  of  gravity  and  that  the  platform  is  level.  Azimuth  alignment  to  TN  isaccomplished  before  flight  by  starting  with  the  magnetic  compass  output  and  applying  variation  toroughly come up with TN reference. From this point, gyrocompassing is performed. This process makesuse of the ability of the gyros to sense the rotation of the earth. If the stable element is misaligned inazimuth, the east gyro will see the wrong earth rate and will cause a precession about the east axis. Thisprecession  will  cause  the  north  accelerometer  to  tilt.  The  output  of  this  accelerometer  is  then  used  totorque the azimuth and east gyro to ensure a TN alignment and a level condition.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200133716.17.6.  In  the  more  modern  gyroscopes,  the  gyro  cannot  be  physically  torqued  because  the  gyro  iseither not moving or the gyro is electronically suspended. In these systems, the stable platform is leveledmathematically  using  gyro  data.  The  precise  orientation  of  the  x  and  y  accelerometers  on  the  stableplatform  is  less  critical  since  the  computer  can  mathematically  correct  for  any  orientation.  The  nextgeneration  of  INS  may  work  without  a  stable  platform,  with  orientation  and  stability  maintainedmathematically from accelerometer inputs.16.18. Integrator. Simply stated, the processing of acceleration is done with an integrator. An integratorintegrates  the  input  to  produce  an  output:  it  multiplies  the  input  signal  by  the  time  it  was  present.Accurate navigation demands extremely accurate integration of both acceleration and velocity. One ofthe  most  used  analog  integrators  is  the  DC  amplifier,  which  uses  a  charging  current  stabilized  to  aspecific  value  proportional  to  an  input  voltage.  Another  analog  integrator  is  the  AC  tachometer-generator,  which  uses  an  input  to  turn  a  motor,  which  physically  turns  the  tachometer-generator,producing an output voltage. The rotation of the motor is proportional to an integral of acceleration.16.19. Computer. The computer changes the integrators' outputs into useful navigation information. Todo this, one accelerometer is mounted aligned to north and another is mounted 90° to the first, to senseeast-west accelerations. Any movement of this system indicates distance traveled east-west and north-south.  The  INS  maintains  a  local  vertical  reference  and  measures  distance  traveled  over  a  referencespheroid perpendicular to the local vertical. On this spheroid, the latitude and longitude of the presentposition are continuously measured by the integration of velocity. In Figure 16.7, q  represents latitudeand l  represents longitude. The axes are designated x, y, and z, corresponding to east, north, and localvertical. This defines their positive directions. References to velocities, attitude angles, and rotation ratesare about the x, y, and z axes. The local vertical (z) is established by platform leveling. This is the mostfundamental  reference  direction.  To  complete  platform  alignment,  the  INS  uses  gyrocompassing  toestablish true north (y). Gyrocompassing establishes platform alignment to the earth's axis of revolutionor  North  Pole.  The  INS  is  capable  of  doing  this  to  an  accuracy  of  10  minutes  of  arc  or  less.  Afteralignment, the platform remains oriented to TN and the local vertical, regardless of the maneuvers of theaircraft.16.19.1. GS components of velocity in track (V) are measured by the system along the x and y axes, asshown in Figure 16.8. These components, Vx and Vy include all effects on the aircraft, such as wind,thermals,  engine  accelerations,  and  speed  brake  decelerations.  Some  form  of  digital  readout  usuallydisplays the GS (V).16.19.2.  The  angles  between  the  aircraft  attitude  and  the  platform  reference  attitude  are  continuouslymeasured by synchros. The aircraft yaws, rolls, and pitches about the platform in a set of gimbals, eachgimbal  being  rotated  through  some  component  of  attitude.  TH  is  measured  as  the  horizontal  anglebetween  the  aircraft's  longitudinal  axis  and  platform  north.  Roll  and  pitch  angles  are  measured  bysynchro transmitters on the platform roll and pitch gimbals.338AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 16.7. Geographic References.Figure 16.8. Measurement of Aircraft Groundspeed.16.20.  Summary.  INS  technology  has  advanced  very  rapidly  within  the  past  few  years.  Advancednavigation  systems  are  commonly  designed  with  INS  as  an  essential  component.  INS  reliability  isAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001339exceptional and INS accuracies are second only to GPS. Traditional INS design has capitalized on theadvances of the digital computer to increase system responsiveness.Section 16D— NAVSTAR Global Positioning System16.21. Basics. Deployment of the NAVSTAR GPS constellation of satellites began with the first launchin  1977.  The  satellites  were  launched  into  precisely  controlled  orbits,  allowing  users  with  GPSequipment to receive data to determine their position. The phenomenal accuracy of GPS was its majorselling  point,  but  its  many  different  applications  were  a  close  second.  GPS  determines  a  positionreferenced to a common grid known as the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84). The WGS 84 gridis based upon a mathematical model and compensates for the fact that the earth is not a perfect sphere(Figure 16.9). Derived using precise satellite measurements, it creates an accurate model of the earth'ssurface. As a consequence, WGS 84 provides extremely accurate information when compared to oldertraditional datum references. The value of the WGS 84 grid is that positional data can be standardizedworldwide. Many receiver sets are capable of converting WGS 84 data into these other commonly usedreferences.Figure 16.9. World Geodetic System 1984.16.22.  Military  Applications.  In  air  operations,  GPS  accuracy  can  improve  en  route  and  terminalnavigation, reducing flight times and fuel consumption. Since it is a three-dimensional system, descent,approach, and landing operations can be monitored more closely.  In combat-related applications, GPSperformance  can  improve  weapons  delivery,  airdrops,  rendezvous,  and  threat  avoidance.  Since  GPSrequires  the  use  of  a  common  grid,  coordination  of  air,  ground,  and  sea  operations  can  be  greatlyimproved. These include close air support, search and rescue, rendezvous, and airdrop operations.16.22.1.  For  ground  forces,  GPS  can  provide  similar  advantages.  Its  accuracy  will  enhance  sitesurveying,  field  artillery  placement,  and  target  acquisition.  First-round  artillery  effectiveness  can  beimproved  based  on  precise  knowledge  of  the  location  of  friendly  firepower,  coupled  with  forward-340AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001observer  determinations  of  enemy  locations  and  movement.  Special  forces  can  operate  with  greaterprecision closer to enemy forces. GPS can also provide benefits to naval forces. Harbor entry operationscan  be  improved.  Coastal  survey  operations  can  be  conducted  more  quickly  and  effectively.  Mineplacement and countermeasure operations can be conducted with greater precision and safety.16.22.2.  In  the  area  of  Command,  Control,  Communications,  and  Intelligence  (C3I),  GPS  performs  avital function by providing worldwide nuclear detonation (NUDET) detection capability to the NationalCommand  Authorities  (NCA).  Each  GPS  satellite  carries  a  sensor  capable  of  detecting  nucleardetonations. This surveillance capability can be used in verifying future Nuclear Test Ban treaties. Moreimportantly, it provides the NCA with the means of monitoring and reacting to a nuclear confrontationshould the need arise.16.23. Civilian Applications. Although originally conceived and developed as a military-only project,GPS information is available to anyone in the civilian community with a receiver.  It provides a broadspectrum of civilian users with accurate position, velocity, and time information at a reasonable cost. Inaddition  to  military  uses  and  benefits,  GPS  is  being  used  in  such  diverse  areas  as  oil  and  mineralexploration,  geophysical  surveys,  airborne  collision  avoidance,  and  maritime  hazard  systems.  Anyonecan buy hand-held GPS receivers with 100-meter accuracy for less then $300. The potential applicationsfor GPS are boundless. The civilian community has a great deal of interest in the applications of GPS,and more sophisticated uses are developed every day.16.24. General System Description. The GPS system is made up of three segments—space, user, andcontrol.16.24.1. Space Segment. The space segment is composed of 24 satellites plus 3 operational spares in 6orbital planes (Figure 16.10). The orbits are arranged precisely such that a minimum of four satellites arein view at all times  worldwide.  The  design  life  of  each  satellite  is  7.5  years  with  an  average  missionduration of 6 years.Figure 16.10. GPS Constellation.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200134116.24.2.  User  Segment.  The  user  segment  consists  of  user  equipment  (UE)  sets  (Figure  16.11),  testequipment,  and  associated  support  equipment.  The  UE  set,  using  data  transmitted  by  the  satellites,determines the user's position, altitude, and velocity. Transmissions from the satellites also allow the UEset  to  evaluate  the  accuracy  of  the  navigational  information  being  received.  This  is  based  on  built-inchecks of its own performance, the configuration of the satellite constellation in view, and the jamming-to-signal ratios being experienced by the set.Figure 16.11. Handheld User Equipment Set.16.24.3. Control Segment. The control segment (Figure 16.12) includes a network of monitor stationsand ground antennas placed throughout the world. The monitor stations track all satellites in view and342AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001monitor  general  health  of  the  system.  Data  from  the  monitor  stations  is  sent  to  and  processed  at  theMaster  Control  Station  (MCS).  This  data  is  then  used  to  refine  and  update  the  satellites'  navigationalsignals.  These  corrections  are  transmitted  to  the  individual  satellites  via  ground  antennas.  Theoperational  master  control  station  is  collocated  with  the  Consolidated  Space  Operations  Center  atPeterson Field CO. Three  ground  antenna stations are located at Diego  Garcia, Ascension  Island,  andKwajalein. Five monitor stations will be positioned in Hawaii, Colorado, and at the three ground antennalocations.Figure 16.12. GPS Control Segment.16.25.  Theory  of  Operation.  A  UE  set  is  capable  of  determining  position,  velocity,  and  timeinformation  by  receiving  ranging  signals  from  a  number  of  satellites.  By  measuring  the  differencebetween signal transmission and reception times and multiplying that time interval (Dt) by the speed oflight, range to the satellite can be determined. In a general sense, this is very similar to the way TACANDME functions, with one important difference.16.25.1. TACAN DME is an active system in that a signal must be sent from the aircraft to the selectedTACAN  ground  station.  The  ground  station  in  turn  sends  a  reply  signal  back  to  the  aircraft.  TheTACAN  set  then  measures  the  Dt  and  then  computes  and  displays  the  range  to  the  station.  GPS  is  apassive  system;  no  signal  is  transmitted  by  the  UE  set  to  the  satellite.  How  does  the  user  or  receiverdetermine when the signal was transmitted by the satellite? The solution is to encode the satellite signalso the receiver knows when it was transmitted.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200134316.25.2. In order to encode the signal with its transmission time, the satellite generates what is known asa pseudorandom noise (PRN) sequence or code. This code is broadcast continuously from each satellite.At  the  same  time,  the  UE  set  simultaneously  generates  an  identical  code.  When  the  set  receives  thesatellite's  signal,  it  compares  it  with  the  code  that  it  has  been  generating.  If  a  signal  arrives  at  thereceiver  with  the  same  code  generated  two  seconds  ago,  we  know  that  the  satellite's  signal  took  2seconds to reach us (Figure 16.13).Figure 16.13. PRN Code Comparison.16.25.3.  If  we  know  the  satellite's  location  in  space  and  our  distance  from  it,  we  know  we  aresomewhere on the sphere having the satellite as its center. With two satellites in view, the user's positionis  somewhere  on  the  circle  representing  the  intersection  of  two  spheres.  A  third  satellite  provides  anadditional  sphere  of  position  whose  intersection  with  the  other  two  will  define  a  three-dimensionalnavigation fix, with timing errors. Figure 16.14 illustrates this concept in two dimensions for clarity. Afourth  allows  us  to  eliminate  most  of  the  timing  errors.  The  accuracy  of  the  navigation  fix  would  bedependent  on  (1)  the  accuracy  of  the  measurement  process  (how  accurately  is  the  digital  signalprocessed), (2) the accuracy of the satellite positions, and (3) the accuracy and stability of the satellites'clocks and the receiver clock. The user equipment should be able to track the satellite's signal to within 3nanoseconds  (3  x  10-9  seconds).  This  is  equivalent  to  a  1-meter  error  in  position.  If  navigationalaccuracy  on  the  order  of  10  meters  is  desired,  we  must  be  able  to  establish  satellite  position  at  aparticular time to within at least 10 meters. This is not a trivial problem. Since the satellite is movingand is subject to complex gravitational attractions and solar winds, measuring and predicting its positionwithin  10  meters  as  a  function  of  time  is  quite  difficult.  Fortunately,  this  ephemeris  (orbital)  data  istransmitted to the receiver in the form of almanac data.16.25.4. Ground stations continuously monitor each satellite so its position can be corrected and passedto the other satellites in the network. Each satellite in reception range transmits its coordinates, a timefactor correction and other data. The receiver solves simultaneous equations for the unknown receivercoordinates  and  the  correct  time.  Four  channel  GPS  receivers  can  use  one  channel  per  satellite  tomaintain  continuous  lock  on  and  update.  Receivers  with  less  than  four  channels  must  continuouslyswitch frequencies and hunt for new satellites that can limit the system responsiveness.344AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 16.14. Resolution of Position.16.25.5. The satellites transmit two code signals, the precision (P) code on 1227.6 MHz and the coarseacquisition (C/A) code on 1575.42 MHz (Figure 16.15). Both codes carry the same types of information.The  C/A  code  will  be  transmitted  with  intentional  errors  to  deny  the  highly  accurate  position  fromunauthorized users. The P code, like its relative, the encrypted Y code, does not include these intentionalerrors. To circumvent the Y code encryption, differential GPS (DGPS) receivers are being designed thatwill  receive  general  GPS  signals  as  well  as  a  fifth  signal  from  a  ground-based  transmitter.  Thesedifferential transmitters can easily determine the intentional error by comparing their GPS position to thesurveyed coordinates of the transmitter. The difference is the intentional error. The ground transmitterswill  compute  and  relay  the  amount  of  intentional  bias  in  the  C/A  code  so  receivers  can  remove  theposition error without use of the P or Y codes.Figure 16.15. Signal Bandwidth.16.26. Clock Error and Pseudo Range. We assumed in the previous discussion that both the satelliteand the UE set were generating identical pseudo codes at exactly the same time. Practically speaking,this is not the case. Each satellite carries an atomic clock accurate to 10-9 seconds. Achieving maximumaccuracy  in  synchronizing  the  codes  would  require  all  users  to  carry  atomic  clocks  with  comparableAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001345accuracies, significantly increasing both the size and cost of each receiver set. As a compromise, eachUE set is equipped with a quartz crystal clock.16.26.1. Since the accuracy of a quartz crystal clock cannot approach that of an atomic clock, there is adifference between satellite GPS system time and UE set time. As  a  result,  the  generation  of  the  twopseudo codes is not perfectly synchronized and a ranging error will be induced. Instead of determiningactual range, we will measure the apparent or pseudo range to the satellite. This particular problem areais known as clock bias.16.26.2. Clock bias affects all range measurements equally. The problem is determining the amount ofbias  error.  Using  three  satellites  allows  us  to  determine  our  position  in  three  dimensions.  By  using  afourth satellite and comparing pseudo codes, the UE set internally determines the amount of adjustmentnecessary to make all of the measurements agree.16.27. Satellite Clock Error. It might be safe to assume that since each satellite carries an atomic clock,it would keep extremely accurate time. Since the compact dimensions of an orbiting satellite limit theclock size, its accuracy does not approach that of ground based atomic clocks. As a consequence, therewill  be  some  error  in  each  satellite's  clock  when  compared  with  "master"  GPS  system  time.  Thesatellite's  generation  of  the  pseudo  code  will  be  slightly  out  of  synch  and  some  ranging  error  will  beinduced. This problem is known as satellite clock error. To compensate for this type of error, the GPScontrol segment comes into play. Monitor stations evaluate the accuracy of the satellite's clock and itspseudo  code  generation.  This  information  is  then  relayed  to  the  master  control  station  where  thenecessary  corrections  to  the  satellite's  transmissions  are  computed.  Updated  information  is  thenuploaded to the satellite via the ground antennas.16.28. Ephemeris Error. Ephemeris is the ability to determine the location of a celestial body (in thiscase a satellite) at regular time intervals. Ephemeris error then is caused by the satellite not being exactlywhere  we  thought  it  was.  By  using  estimation  theory  techniques,  the  computers  at  the  master  controlstation predict what the satellite's position should be at a specific time. This predicted position is thencompared with the  actual position as determined by  the  monitor  stations.  Updated  information  on  thesatellite's future position is then uploaded to each satellite on a regular basis via the ground antennas.Each satellite then continuously transmits these corrections to all users. In this way, ranging error causedby uncertainty as to the satellite's exact position is minimized.16.29. Atmospheric Propagation Error. We assumed that the satellite's RF signal traveled at the speedof light, as it does in a vacuum like space. But just as light is refracted through a prism, the RF signal isbent and slowed down as it enters the ionosphere. The degree to which the signal is affected depends onthe  atmospheric  conditions  between  the  satellite  and  receiver  and  on  the  signal's  angle  as  it  passesthrough the ionosphere. Atmospheric propagation error can cause position uncertainties up to 40 meters.By noting the time delay between the two  L-Band signals, much  of  the  effect  caused  by  atmosphericpropagation  can  be  removed  internally  by  the  UE  set.  Since  only  the  military  will  be  capable  ofsimultaneously monitoring both of the frequencies, civilian users will be forced to live with this error.16.30. Survivability and Security. For the GPS system to be successful, it must be able to survive andoperate in spite of hostile actions against it. From the program's outset, GPS development efforts haveemphasized the importance of system survivability. The potential threats to the space, control, and usersegments  have  been  scrutinized  and  counter  threat  features  have  been  incorporated  into  the  system'sdesign.346AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200116.30.1. The main threat to the space segment is direct attack of GPS satellites by lasers, particle beamweapons, and anti-satellite missiles. To counter these threats, all satellites incorporate nuclear and laserhardening features. Since GPS employs a large constellation of satellites with three orbiting spares, thedirect  attack  on  a  small  number  of  satellites  will  not  render  the  entire  system  inoperative.  Rather,  itwould lead to a gradual degradation of system performance. If a satellite is destroyed, a spare will bepositioned near the failed satellite. If a spare is not located nearby, adjacent satellites will be moved toprovide optimum coverage until a new satellite can be launched and positioned. There will be a periodof a few hours during which a satellite being repositioned will be unavailable for service and up to 24hours if one of the backup atomic clocks is brought into service. The overall impact on the system willbe minimal.16.30.2.  The  control  segment,  composed  of  the  MCS  and  the  remotely  located  monitor  stations  andground antennas, could be subject to direct enemy attack, sabotage, or high-energy jammers. To countercontrol segment threats, redundant monitor and ground antennas were used so that deactivation of anyone station will not affect the system as a whole. To protect against enemy attack or sabotage, a highsecurity protection system is employed at the MCS, monitor stations, and ground antennas. To counterthe threat of jamming or spoofing, encrypted data is used in all ground-to-space telemetry command andcontrol links. In the event the MCS is destroyed or unable to upload data to the satellites, the system willnot collapse. The system will suffer some gradual degradation of performance, but GPS will remain aviable navigational aid.16.30.3. The key threats to the user equipment sets include electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from nucleardetonations  and  jamming  or  spoofing  from  unfriendly  sources.  Should  hostile  activity  result  in  short-term  GPS  system  outages,  the  impact  on  navigation  should  be  minimal  since  most  aircraft  have  anavigator as a crewmember, or are equipped with a self-contained navigation system (such as an INS).To counter the effects of EMP, all military sets are radiation hardened. To reduce or negate the impact ofjamming or spoofing, the spread-spectrum L-band satellite signals provide substantial resistance.16.30.4.  In  extremely hostile electronic warfare  environments, high dynamic sets, in conjunction withsystems  such  as  INS,  have  been  designed  to  further  counter  the  jamming  threat.  Such  sets  aresophisticated enough to estimate the approximate ranging data they should receive from each selectedsatellite. If the received signal does not match this expected data, it is rejected as being spurious and isignored when determining the user's position. The possibility always exists that unfriendly forces coulduse  the  system  during  national  or  international  conflicts.  To  preclude  this  possibility,  the  selectiveavailability features will permit authorized users to navigate with full accuracy while unauthorized userswill experience degraded navigational performance. However, recent advances in DGPS and local areaaugmentation  can  now  provide  equal  or  better  accuracy  than  the  encrypted  Y  code  signal  and  areavailable to virtually everyone.16.31. Summary. GPS accuracy is unquestionable, producing accuracies within meters. An INS backupcannot be jammed or intercepted and will provide acceptable accuracy in all weather. Combination INS-GPS units in development now will be standard equipment by the end of the century. New computersthat take up less room than a briefcase can process multiple inputs from several sensors (GPS, INS, andDoppler)  and  will  also  provide  wind,  heading,  course,  distance,  and  time  information  automatically.Nevertheless,  we  always  include  an  aviator  as  part  of  a  weapon  system.  This  is  especially  true  oncomplex operational missions requiring the flexibility that only a person can provide. On such a mission,these sophisticated pieces of equipment are only tools that an aviator uses to make important decisions.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001347Chapter 17LOW-LEVEL NAVIGATIONSection 17A— Introduction17.1. Basics. The main reasons for conducting low-level operations are to gain the element of surprise,to  avoid  detection  or  interception,  and  to  minimize  the  effect  of  enemy  defenses.  Operations  such  aspersonnel drops and aerial resupply missions demand a low-level capability. The problem of performingaccurate  navigation  at  low  altitudes  differs  considerably  from  that  at  higher  altitudes.  Low-levelnavigation requires comprehensive flight planning, accurate dead reckoning (DR), and extensive use ofall available aids. You must work very rapidly to obtain and interpret in-flight observations. In general,low altitude flying affects the navigation problem because of reduced radar and visual range, potentialadverse weather situations, and the need for reactive decision making. In addition, the normal mechanicsof navigation such as writing, computing, and plotting  are made difficult or  impossible  by  turbulenceencountered at low altitudes.Section 17B— Planning the Mission17.2.  Basics.  The  key  to  successful  low-level  navigation  is  careful  and  comprehensive  planningaccomplished  prior  to  the  flight.  Every  minute  spent  in  flight  planning  helps  to  ensure  the  low-levelmission will be successful.17.3.  Route  Determination.  Carefully  select  the  route  with  emphasis  upon  navigational  checkpoints,safety of flight, and possible threats. Turn points should be over or close to identifiable points, such asthose that provide good land-water contrast or give good radar definition at maximum range.17.3.1. Directness. To conserve time and fuel, the route should be as direct as possible. A direct routealso minimizes the time spent within range of enemy defenses such as surface-to-air missiles or air-to-air interceptors.17.3.2. Radius of Turn. Compute radius of turns for all turn points since the aircraft must roll out oncourse (unless flying point to point). Remember that flying faster or slower than flight planned airspeedwill change your turn radius.17.3.3. Altitude. Terrain elevation, both along the intended flight path and adjacent to it, is an extremelyimportant factor when planning mission altitudes. Normal altitudes for low-level combat missions arebetween 100 and 500 feet above ground level. On domestic training missions, adhere to the flight rulesin FLIP.17.3.4. Altimeter Errors. Two types of altimeter errors enter into consideration when planning a low-level mission. They are caused by (1) differences in barometric pressure along the route of flight and (2)known  deficiencies  in  the  altimeter.  You  can  obtain  reliable  information  along  the  route  from  theforecaster during the weather briefing or from the Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC).17.3.5. Airspeed. Normally, low-level missions are flight planned for  airspeeds that make mental DRcomputations simple. These are 240 knots (4 NM per minute), 300 knots (5 NM per minute), 360 knots348AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001(6 NM per minute), etc. While it is important to maintain a constant GS for accurate DR, you may haveto vary the GS to control the time of arrival at turn points and over the target.17.3.6.  Fuel  Planning.  Fuel  consumption  is  a  major  consideration  in  low-level  planning.  Aircraftconsume more fuel at low altitude than they do at high altitude. Since combat sorties leave very smallfuel tolerances for recovery, carefully plan all phases to conserve fuel. The navigator usually assists thepilot by closely monitoring fuel quantities. The fuel consumption problem is further complicated by thevariable load requirements for specific missions.17.3.7. Threats. Plot any known threats and their tactical ranges. Avoid threats to the maximum extentpossible by flying around them. If unable to avoid threats, use terrain masking to reduce the effectiverange. If it's impossible to avoid the threat, request threat suppression or reevaluate the mission.17.3.8. Weather Planning. On combat missions, there is no designated minimum ceiling and visibilitycondition for low-level flight. The wind velocities encountered at low altitude over land  are  generallylight. However, because of surface friction, particularly in rugged terrain, these winds tend to be veryvolatile.17.3.8.1.  Because  of  this  inconsistency  and  for  reasons  of  simplicity,  low-level  flight  planning  isnormally based on no-wind conditions.17.3.8.2.  In  planning  low-level  missions  over  water,  spin  a  wind  corrected  flight  plan  for  greatestaccuracy. Overwater navigation depends entirely on DR and computer and/or GPS systems because ofthe absence of checkpoints with which to establish fixes and to make course corrections.17.4. Chart Selection. One of several charts may be appropriate for low altitude navigation. One chartdesigned for low-level use is the Operational Navigation Chart (ONC). The 1:1,000,000 scale permitsidentification  of  all  visual  and  radar  significant  features  and  the  chart  has  good  cultural  and  reliefportrayal. For increased detail or slower speed aircraft, the Tactical Pilotage Chart (TPC) (1:500,000) ora Joint Operations Graphic (JOG) (1:250,000) may be used.17.4.1.  It  is  possible  to  mix  navigation  charts.  The  en  route  portion  of  the  low-level  mission  can  beplotted on an ONC, while the TPC or JOG may be used for the target area or for specific identificationof checkpoints. If available, aerial photos are very useful for route study.17.4.2. Annotate items of importance to navigation (turn points, descent points, high terrain, emergencyairfields, etc.) on the chart. Label preplanned fixes with planned radar range and bearing information. Inall cases, the annotations should be neat and compact for quick reference. Time is critical at high speedand low altitude, so minimize the time you spend interpreting your chart in flight.17.5. Planned Pacing. Choose suitable topographic or cultural returns for in-flight fixing and determinea  pacing  schedule  to  accommodate  these  fixes.  Plan  the  entire  mission  before  takeoff.  What  youaccomplish in the air is merely a follow-through of what  you have previously flight planned. Becausenavigation demands flexibility, planning a pacing schedule involves two separate steps. First, complete apremission  plan  based  on  expected  in-flight  conditions.  Then,  construct  an  alternate  plan  in  case  theunexpected happens. For example, a 120-NM navigation leg, flown at 360, knots might accommodatethree radar fixes. This plan becomes the primary pacing schedule for the leg. A secondary pacing planmight consider an unforeseen increase in GS and it would incorporate only two fixes. These principlesAFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001349apply  to  visual  navigation  as  well  as  radar,  but  the  fixes  are  generally  closer  together  in  visualnavigation.17.6. Route Study. For a successful low-level mission, you must conduct a thorough route study. Routestudy  involves  the  entire  crew,  not  just  the  navigator.  In  some  missions,  a  pilot,  loadmaster,  flightengineer, or boom operator can act as your map-reader, so they must know the same basic informationyou know. Plan your en route updates during route study.17.7.  Radar  Prediction.  Radarscope  interpretation  can  be  preplanned  for  low-level  flights.  Notesignificant returns, such as land-water contrast, unique terrain features, and towns. The time of year isalso important since radar returns during the winter may not appear the same as in other seasons of theyear.17.7.1. At low altitudes, the appearance of a radar return changes rapidly as the aircraft approaches orpasses over the return. Often, the best identifying features of a  checkpoint cannot be distinguished byradar at low altitude. Because of this reduced radar range, the navigator should use  DR procedures toverify and identify radar returns.17.7.2. No-return areas like lakes and rivers are better for radar prediction and navigation because theyfurnish more accurate fixes than do towns or similar type returns. Constantly fine-tune your tilt and gainsettings; they are critical at low altitude. Use radar navigation in conjunction with an INS or GPS at low-level for best effect.17.8. Visual Prediction. In addition to the problems mentioned in radar prediction, other problems areencountered with forecasting map-reading fixes. Weather effects, such as precipitation, smoke, haze, orblowing dust, may obscure features intended for fixing. Visual navigation is especially difficult whenlooking  into  the  sun,  particularly  in  hazy  conditions.  Avoid  using  cultural  features  for  checkpointsbecause they contain people and perhaps enemy forces, and during conflict should be avoided.Section 17C— Course Control17.9. Maintaining Track. To meet controlled times of arrival and to avoid terrain hazards, attempt tofly  the  low-level  flight  exactly  as  planned.  Every  low-level  navigation  leg  is  planned  within  a  flightcorridor  for  safety-of-flight  reasons.  There  are  several  ways  to  maintain  course,  each  of  which  hasadvantages and limitations. Some of the methods are described here.17.9.1. Correction to a Point on Centerline. When radar is an available aid, use the manual cursor tocorrect  back  to  centerline.  Locate  a  suitable  target  on  centerline  and  determine  the  intercept  return  tocenterline.  The  intercept  correction  (degrees  of  heading  change)  is  an  arbitrary  determination  basedprimarily on the distance of the target from the aircraft. The closer the target is, the larger the correctionwill be. However, heading corrections should normally not exceed 45o. Move the manual cursor to thedesired intercept angle on the side of the scope opposite the target from 360o and  turn  the  aircraft  anequal number of degrees toward the radar return. When the target falls under the repositioned manualcursor, the aircraft has returned to centerline and the heading correction should be taken out. Example:Aircraft 3 NM right of course, target found 15 NM down course, 45o intercept. Move manual cursor 45oright (045 bearing), turn aircraft 45o left (3l5o heading). When target is under repositioned cursor, theaircraft has returned to centerline and heading correction should be taken out.350AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200117.9.2.  30o  Intercept  Method.  The  30o  intercept  method  can  be  used  when  no  target  is  available  oncourse  line  but  the  relative  aircraft  position  left  or  right  of  course  is  known.  The  steps  involved  tointercept course are:17.9.2.1. Parallel course.17.9.2.2. Determine the distance the aircraft is left or right of course and double the distance.17.9.2.3. Determine the time needed to fly the doubled distance by using current GS.17.9.2.4. Turn 30o in the direction back to centerline.17.9.2.5. When time has elapsed, turn to desired magnetic course (MC) and kill the drift.EXAMPLE: Aircraft 3 NM right, GS 360 knots, magnetic heading (MH) 270o. Turn to 240o and holdcorrection for 1 minute. After 1 minute has elapsed, return to MH 270o.17.9.3.  Off-Course  Correction  Tables.  Off-course  corrections  can  also  be  determined  by  using  thetable shown in Figure 17.1. Enter from the top of the table with the miles-off-course, go vertically to theline representing miles flown, and read the correction to intercept. You must be paralleling course to usethis table.17.9.4. Correction to Intercept Course. The graph shown in Figure 17.2 is used when it is necessary tointercept course rather than converge at the turn point. To use this graph, the entering arguments are NMoff course and GS. The table can be used for fixed alterations of 15o, 30o, or 45o. Enter the graph on theleft with NM off course; go horizontally across the chart to the line representing GS. Then, go verticallyto the top or bottom (depending on the desired degrees to alter) to  read the time required to interceptcourse. After altering the  indicated  time  has  elapsed,  correct  back  to  the  original  heading  to  maintaindesired course.17.10. Sixty-to-One Correction. One degree of latitude, measured along a meridian, is equal to 60 NMand 1 minute of arc is equal to 1 NM. If you're 60 NM from the next turn point, 1 NM off course andparalleling course (drift killed); a 1o turn toward centerline will put the aircraft over the turn point. Mostof the time you will be less than 60 NM from the turn point; therefore, divide 60 by the distance to go tothe next turn point, then multiply by the number of NM off course. For example, if 30 NM from the turnpoint and 3 NM left of course, take 60/30 X 3 to get a 6o required correction. Apply the 6o to the desiredMC and kill the drift for a good heading to correct back to the turn point.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 17.1. Off-Course Correction Table.351352AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 17.2. Correction to Intercept Course.17.11.  Ten,  Twenty,  or  Thirty  Degree  Correction  Technique.  This  course  correction  technique  isused  when  3  NM  or  less  off  course.  It  uses  10o,  20o,  or  30o  heading  corrections  back  to  centerline,depending on your distance off course. Begin by paralleling course. Second, determine the distance leftor  right  of  course.  Third,  multiply  the  number  of  NM  off  course  by  10  to  determine  the  number  ofdegrees to turn toward centerline. Fourth, hold the correction for 6 NM of travel (example, 300 knots GS1:12, 360 knots GS 1 minute). At the end of the time, turn back to MC and kill the drift.Section 17D— Time Control17.12.  Time  Control.  Positive  time  control  of  aircraft  flying  low-level  missions  is  imperative.  Eachsortie is assigned a specific time to arrive at each designated turn point and over the target zone. Failureto meet your ETA precisely can result in aborted missions or two aircraft occupying the same airspacesimultaneously  (very  bad).  Annotate  route  legs  on  the  chart  with  a  series  of  small  time  ticks  drawnacross the leg. Space these time ticks 1 minute apart according to forecast GS; for example, 6 NM apartfor  a  planned  GS  of  360  knots.  Time  ticks  begin  at  the  low-level  entry  (starting)  point  and  continuethrough the entire route to the target. With these time ticks, you can check the time over each tick andkeep a running account of whether the aircraft is ahead of or behind the required time schedule.17.13. Methods of Time Control. If you need to change GS, use an established method to make thischange accurately and quickly. Six methods are presented in the following paragraphs. These are not theonly accepted methods but are some of the easier methods to use. As with most time corrections, thesemethods are based on flight planned GS.17.13.1. Proportional Method. The proportional method can be used either high or low-level. Begin bydetermining the number of seconds early or late. Next, increase or decrease flight planned GS by thatincrement (20 seconds = 20 knots). Hold this correction for the following length of time: flight plannedGS/60 minutes (360 knots/60 = 6 minutes).AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001353EXAMPLE: You are 30 seconds late and your flight planned GS is 420 knots. Increase flight plannedGS (420 knots) by 30 knots (450 knots) and hold it for 7 minutes.17.13.2. Total Time and/or Total Distance. This method is normally used at high-level but also appliesto low-level. Check the distance to  your next checkpoint and  compare current  Zulu time with desiredZulu time at the next checkpoint. This will give you a time and distance to go. Set up a ratio on the MB-4 computer by putting the desired time to go over the distance to go and look above the rate index forthe required GS.EXAMPLE:  Current  Zulu  time  is  1100:00  and  distance  to  go  is  140  NM.  Desired  ETA  at  the  nextcheckpoint is 1120:00. You must fly 140 NM in 20 minutes or 420 knots GS (140 NM/20 minutes = 420knots GS/rate index).17.13.3. Turn Point Method. During mission planning, a correction factor can be calculated for eachlow-level leg. This is done by multiplying each low-level leg time by the appropriate coefficient (Figure17.3). The correction factor calculated for each leg equals the number of seconds gained or lost for each10 knots of speed change from flight planned GS over the entire leg.EXAMPLE: Leg time is 7 minutes, 42 seconds. Flight planned GS is 420 knots. Coefficient extractedfrom  Figure  17.3  is  1.5.  Multiply  leg  time  by  coefficient  factor  (7:42  x  1.5)  to  equal  approximatecorrection factor of 12. You are 36 seconds late at your last turn point (based on Zulu time). You willgain 12 seconds over the length of the low-level leg for each 10 knots increase in flight planned  GS.Therefore, an increase in flight planned GS of 30 knots to 450 knots will gain 36 seconds if 450 knots isheld for the entire leg.Figure 17.3. Coefficient Table.17.13.4.  Six  Minutes  Out  Method.  To  use  this  method,  determine  the  distance  remaining  to  acheckpoint 6 minutes prior to the time required over the turn point. Multiply this distance by 10 to getrequired GS to fly to turn point, starting 6 minutes out.EXAMPLE: Required time at checkpoint is 1413:27. Six minutes before (1407:27)  you  are  38.5  NMfrom the turn point. A GS of 385 knots at 1407:27 will put you at the checkpoint on time.17.13.5.  Ten  Percent  Method.  Determine  the  amount  of  time  to  gain  or  lose.  Adjust  your  GS  to  10percent above (if late) or below (if early) of the flight-planned GS (10% x 300 knots = 30 knots). Therule states that holding the 10 percent increase or decrease of flight-planned GS for 10 minutes will gain354AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001or lose 1 minute. This also means that one can gain or lose 6 seconds for every minute the adjustment ismaintained. To apply this method, determine the 10-percent factor during mission planning.EXAMPLE: In flight, you determine you are 35 seconds late. Your flight-planned GS is 300 knots. Youshould increase  your GS by 30 knots (to 330 knots)  and  hold  it  for  6  minutes.  This  will  make  up  36seconds.17.13.6. Incremental Method. To determine the increment, you must find your miles per minute (300knots = 5 miles per minute). Multiply that by 10 to obtain the increment (5 X 10 = 50 knots). Determinetime ahead or behind in seconds. Divide this time by 10 to obtain the number of minutes  to  hold  thecorrection. The rule of thumb states that if the increment is held for 1 minute, you will gain or lose 10seconds.EXAMPLE:  You  are  90  seconds  late  and  your  flight-planned  GS  is  300  knots.  The  increment  is  50knots. Increase flight-planned GS (300 knots) by 50 knots (350 knots) and hold it for 9 minutes.NOTE: Remember that most methods are based on flight-planned GS. Apply the correction to the flight-planned GS, not the current GS.17.14. Summary. The most important phase of the low-level mission is flight planning. If the mission isplanned well and there is good crew coordination, mission success is greatly enhanced. Consequently,you should (1) know what aids will be available, (2) be familiar with all phases of the particular missionand study them until a clear mental picture of the flight emerges and finally, (3) maintain good, reliablein-flight DR procedures. If you do all this, the low-level mission will be greatly simplified. If not, thechances of success are greatly reduced.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001355Chapter 18AERIAL DELIVERYSection 18A— Introduction18.1. Basics. Placing a bomb on the target or aerial delivery of troops and supplies require many of thesame techniques. Timing on aerial delivery missions is critical and precise arrival over the target or dropzone must be carefully planned and executed. The low  altitude  portion  of  the  mission  can  be  used  toupdate ballistics for the bomb release point (BRP) or computed air release point (CARP) information.18.1.1.  Finding  the  BRP  and  finding  the  CARP  require  similar  data  and  computations.  Both  pointsrequire  simultaneous  solving  of  four  different  problems:  target  ID,  time  control,  track  control,  anddetermining  the  release  point.  Locating  the  proper  release  point  in  space  is  a  simple  airplot  problem.Any  object  dropped  from  an  aircraft  is  affected  by  certain  factors  including  aircraft  airspeed,  altitudeabove the target, air resistance on the dropped object, and wind effect.18.1.2. Navigation computers greatly simplify locating the release point. However, you must carefullycontrol all inputs to the computer since any input error will affect delivery accuracy. So remember if youput garbage in your computer, you will get garbage out.Section 18B— The Bombing Problem18.2. Basics. Precision bombing is the heart of the bombardier's profession. Success as a bombardier ismeasured  in  feet  and  seconds,  and  often  in  fractions  of  seconds.  The  bombing  problem  ismathematically  resolved  in  a  bombing  computer  to  solve  for  what  is  technically  termed  the  bombresolver locus (BRL). The aircraft must be flown to the BRL to reach the bomb release point (BRP). TheBRP  is  located  upwind  of  the  target  along  the  computed  BRP.  The  BRL  is  constantly  changingthroughout  the  bomb  run  to  compensate  for  many  factors  including  wind,  altitude,  airspeed,  aimingupdates, heading, and other factors which affect the bombing solution. You should know the elements ofthe  basic  bombing  problem  to  understand  the  solution.  These  elements  can  be  viewed  in  two  planes,horizontally and vertically, solved simultaneously.18.2.1.  Horizontal  Problem  (Figure  18.1).  The  horizontal  problem  is  concerned  with  establishingheading to the BRL. To determine the release heading, the bombing computer must be able to locate thetarget to determine wind effect on the bomb. By placing the crosshairs (electronically generated signalon the radarscope) on a radar return, the operator identifies the target for the computer. By resolving forwind effect or wind to impact (WTI) on the bomb against time remaining to impact (TI), the computerprovides release heading and range to the BRL. For simplicity, the BRL is an air position and the BRP isa ground position. The air leg consists of a true heading and air distance to release, and the wind leg iswind effect on the aircraft. Although constantly changing, the BRL is the point at which the crew mustaim the aircraft in order to reach the BRP.356AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 18.1. Horizontal Bombing Problem.18.2.2. Vertical Problem (Figure 18.2). The vertical problem is concerned with establishing the time ofrelease. Time to go (TTG) is the time remaining until the bombs are released. To determine the exacttime of release, you must know two elements: how long the weapon will be in the air from release untilimpact  (time  of  fall  or  TF),  and  trail  (L),  distance  the  aircraft  travels  past  the  target  before  bombdetonation or impact. Released too soon, the bomb falls short; released too late, the bomb falls beyondthe target. The TF and trail are taken from ballistics tables and set into the computer. Because the shape,size, and drag of bombs vary greatly, separate tables are used for each type bomb. The virtual impactpoint (VIP) is the position of the aircraft at the moment of impact or detonation, providing the aircraftstays on heading after release. The system computes the time remaining to impact when the crosshairsare placed on the target. The formula is TG = (distance to target + L)/GS - TF.18.2.2.1. On a typical bomb run, the bombardier places the crosshairs on the aiming point and sets thebombing computer into operation. The pilot centers the directional indicator aligning the aircraft on thecomputed heading for release, and may give the bombardier steering control of the aircraft by way of anauto pilot hookup. The bombardier checks true airspeed and altitude to assure that the ballistic settingsare  still  correct.  At  a  precomputed  range  the  timing  meter  will  start;  this  provides  the  countdown  tobomb release.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 18.2. Vertical Bombing Problem.35718.2.2.2. While it appears only a matter of keeping the crosshairs on the aiming plot, the bombardier isactually furnishing the bombing computer with all the inputs needed to solve the bombing problem. Afew seconds prior to "bombs away," the bomb bay doors open; at "bombs away," a signal is sent to therelease  circuits  and  the  weapons  are  dropped.  After  bomb  release,  the  pilot  again  takes  over  aircraftsteering. Whether a B-52 or an F-15E delivers the bomb, the principles are the same and the bombingproblem is solved in a similar manner by computers.Section 18C— Computed Air Release Point18.3. Basics. The computed air release point system is the standard tactical drop system for personneland equipment. Commonly referred  to  as  a  CARP,  it  is  a  scientific  approach  to  a  parachute-bombingproblem.  The  mathematical  CARP  solution  is  based  on  average  parachute  ballistics  and  fundamentaldead reckoning principles.18.3.1. The aircraft commander is responsible for insuring the CARP solution is computed and used inall parachute operations not using a ground-marked or electronic release point. In reality, the navigatoris responsible for the actual solution of the CARP (Figure 18.3).18.3.2.  In  flight,  the  pilot  and  navigator  jointly  confirm  the  offset  distance  for  the  CARP.  The  pilotassumes the responsibility for maintaining the offset distance and required track. The navigator picks thetiming  point  (if  used),  controls  the  time  to  release,  and  continually  crosschecks  the  offset  distance.Cooperation and teamwork among the crew are crucial to airdrop success.358Figure 18.3. Completed CARP.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200135918.4. Governing Factors. The CARP computes the release point of the first parachute-supported object.The actual ground pattern of the remaining airdropped personnel or equipment depends upon:18.4.1. Time between "Green Light" and the time of last exit.18.4.2. Aircraft stability from "Green Light" throughout the jump or extraction period.18.4.3. Uniformity of loads or parachute types within elements.18.4.4. Glide angle of individual parachutes.18.4.5. Aircraft track across the drop zone.18.4.6. Aircraft altitude and speed.18.4.7. Weather, primarily winds.18.5. Initial Point (IP). The initial point should be a prominent yet a relatively small checkpoint, andshould  be  located  a  sufficient  distance  from  the  drop  zone  to  allow  slowdown  to  drop  airspeed,performance of slowdown maneuvers, and for any respacing of formation that might be required. The IPshould be located as close as possible to the axis of the drop zone (DZ).18.6. Release Point. The location of the release point is critical to the accuracy of the drop and can bedetermined  in  several  ways.  Drop  accuracy  is  measured  in  yards,  not  miles.  Since  it  is  difficult  toprecisely  position  the  aircraft  over  a  point  due  to  limited  downward  visibility,  timing  points  or  othermeans are often used to determine the release point. When the computed air release point falls abeam asmall, easily recognizable checkpoint, a timing point is unnecessary.18.6.1. Visual. The simplest method for accurate airdrops is to locate a small, precise landmark that thecrew can easily find. Depending on the location of the CARP, "Green Light" can be called as the aircraftcomes abeam this point, or the navigator can begin timing to reach the release point. Generally, a timingpoint close to the CARP will be more accurate than one far away. This technique can be used during theday, at night under natural illumination, or using night vision goggles.18.6.2. Sight Angle Drop (SAD). SAD was developed in response to the need for a visual drop withouthaving detailed photos of the drop zone environment. Sight angle is based on trigonometry, and is basedon  looking  at  the  point-of-impact  (PI)  through  the  front  windscreen  at  a  known  angle.  Knowing  thealtitude of PI  and  aircraft  deck  angle  and  using  tabular  data,  the  navigator  can  extract  the  distance  atwhich the PI will disappear under the nose of the aircraft. When it does, the navigator begins timing tothe  release  point.  The  accuracy  of  this  type  of  drop  depends  highly  on  a  stable  airspeed  and  altitudeduring the timing period.18.6.3.  Computer.  Another  way  to  locate  the  CARP  is  to  use  highly  accurate  navigation  computers.Either  GPS  or  INS,  assisted  by  ground-based  signals,  is  both  reliable  and  accurate  enough  to  droppersonnel and equipment, and does not rely on VFR conditions to drop.18.6.4. Electronic. Electronic means is another method to determine the release point. One way uses aground-based  radar  beacon  to  mark  the  release  point.  The  navigator  directs  the  aircraft  to  the  beacon360AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001using  the  radar,  and  times  to  the  release  point  using  the  radar  range  marks.  The  long  distance  flownwhile timing (typically 1-2 nautical miles) keeps this type of drop from being pinpoint accurate. Anotheruses a beacon that interfaces with the aircraft's navigation computer and can automatically steer to theCARP and release the load.18.6.4.1. Weather Aerial Delivery System (AWADS). The adverse Weather Aerial Delivery System(AWADS) can also be used. This system allows on-board radar updates to the computer, which is thenused to guide the aircraft to the CARP. Finally, more and more aircraft are being equipped with GPSwhich can provide very accurate navigation to the CARP.18.6.4.2. Station Keeping Equipment (SKE). You can also locate the release point using informationtransmitted from another aircraft. In an IFR airdrop formation, the lead aircraft uses one of the abovemethods  to  locate  the  release  point.  SKE-equipped  follower  aircraft  time  from  signals  transmitted  bylead to locate their respective release points.18.7. Parachute Ballistics. The ballistics of different types of parachutes varies greatly. Each parachuteis designed for a specific purpose and has its own peculiar characteristics. The parachute ballistics usedin the solution of the CARP, for forward travel time and vertical distances, are averages that are accurateenough to use on airdrops. One important characteristic of parachutes that cannot be computed in theCARP solution is the gliding characteristics of each parachute. A parachute glides in random directionsduring its descent and these directions tend to cancel out. If this were not the case, it would be extremelydifficult  to  obtain  the  desired  accuracy,  even  if  other  variables  (such  as  wind  effect  and  aircraftpositioning) were negligible. For example, the T-10 parachute has a gliding angle of 18 degrees from thevertical. This gliding effect is what makes parachutes appear to drift under no-wind conditions.18.8. Components:18.8.1.  Vertical  Distance.  The  distance,  in  feet,  a  load  falls  after  exiting  the  aircraft  and  prior  tostabilization (Figure 18.4).18.8.2. Rate of Fall. The rate of fall is the vertical velocity, in feet per second, of the airdropped loadwhile  under  full  parachute  canopy.  Rate  of  fall  is  corrected  to  a  standard  day  sea-level  rate  whencorrected for air density.18.8.3.  Time  of  Fall  Constant  (TFC).  A  constant  in  seconds  computed  during  airdrop  tests  thatcompensates for the nonlinear rate of fall from load exit to stabilization. This factor is used to determinedrift effect during stabilization (TFC = ST – DQ).18.8.4. Forward Travel Time. Exit time plus deceleration quotient. A time constant that compensatesfor the horizontal distance the object travels from the green light signal until reaching stabilization. Thisfactor is used to compute FTD.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 18.4. Horizontal View of the CARP.36118.8.5. Forward Travel Distance (FTD). The ground distance traveled by the airdropped load from thegreen light signal to stabilization. Plot FTD back from the point-of-impact (PI) along DZ axis. Convertthe forward travel time in seconds to forward travel distance in yards (or meters) on the MB-4 using thisformula:18.8.6. Drift Effect. Drift effect is the distance the parachute and load drift during the total time of fall.This effect depends upon the total time of fall of the parachute load and the wind velocity. Compute drifteffect using the following procedures:18.8.6.1. Find the time of fall by dividing the deployment altitude by the adjusted rate of fall to find thenumber of seconds required for the parachute to descend from time of full deployment to the ground.The parachute starts to drift as soon as it leaves the aircraft. Therefore, you should add the time of fallconstant to the time of fall to determine the total time of fall that is the number of seconds the load isfalling free of the aircraft and is affected by the wind.18.8.6.2. Then multiply the total time of fall by the wind velocity to find the drift effect. The formula is:18.8.7. Plotting CARP. The forward travel distance and drift effect have been discussed in the sequencein which they occur; however, the CARP is plotted as follows:362AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200118.8.7.1. Starting from the point of impact, plot the drift effect upwind.18.8.7.2. Plot the forward travel distance back along the DZ axis from the end of the wind vector. Theend of the forward travel vector is the CARP location (Figure 18.5).Figure 18.5. CARP and DZ Diagram.18.9. Summary. Bombing and airdropping use the same physical principles to accomplish the mission.Both rely on a mathematical computation to determine the effect of wind and gravity on the bomb orairdrop  item.  After  compensating  for  that  effect  to  locate  the  release  point,  both  require  pinpointaccuracy and split-second timing to properly execute the mission.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001363Chapter 19AIR REFUELINGSection 19A— Introduction19.1.  Basics.  Global  air  refueling  is  the  primary  means  of  extending  US  air  power  worldwide.  Thedecrease  in  operating  bases  on  foreign  soil  and  the  application  of  aircraft  for  roles  in  command  andcontrol, logistics, and long range reconnaissance has expanded the role of air refueling to support all AirForce missions. Although tankers still support the Single Integrated Operations Plan (SIOP) missions,they are also called upon to provide support to a wide range of operations that include most of the USAir Force's aircraft and some friendly foreign aircraft as well. The information contained in this sectionis general and nondirective in nature. Consult specific command directives if planning aerial refuelingoperations.19.2.  Mission  Planning.  It  is  very  helpful  to  coordinate  information  between  receiver  and  tankeraircrews while mission planning.  For operational missions, do not compromise  security  by  discussingsensitive or classified information through unsecured media. When it is feasible to communicate beforeflight on training missions, tanker and receiver crews should confirm basic scheduling information anddiscuss pertinent details of the mission. Pre-flight communication often clears up problems that couldcause  confusion,  possibly  resulting  in  a  dangerous  situation  while  airborne.  Discuss  or  confirm  thefollowing items prior to flight when practical:19.2.1. Takeoff times and locations.19.2.2. Call signs and number of aircraft.19.2.3. Routing to the air refueling.19.2.4. Type of rendezvous.19.2.5. Timing considerations.19.2.6. Refueling altitude and track.19.2.7. Amount of fuel to be transferred.19.2.8. Training requirements.19.2.9. End of air refueling routing or altitude.19.2.10. Formation procedures.19.2.11. Radio frequencies/equipment settings.19.2.12. MARSA procedures.364AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001NOTE:  When  air  refueling  control  points  (ARCP)  are  located  above  60o  north  or  below  60o  southlatitude, polar navigation (USAF Grid) may be required. Grid courses may vary significantly from onetype projection to another.Section 19B— Communication19.3. Basics. During air refueling operations, communication between tanker and receiver crews mustbe a highly coordinated effort. Tankers and receivers communicate over a dedicated refueling frequency.Voice  transmissions  on  that  frequency  should  be  concise  and  kept  to  an  absolute  minimum.  Anyunnecessary  transmissions  could  provide  useful  information  to  the  enemy  in  a  hostile  environment.Receiver and tanker crews should use standard radio calls and terminology to minimize confusion.Section 19C— Refueling Tracks19.4. Basics. Air  refueling  tracks  are  published  in  FLIP  AP/1B.  This  publication  contains  geographiccoordinates,  air  refueling  frequencies,  altitudes,  rendezvous  equipment  settings,  and  specific  notes.Rules governing air refueling can be found in Federal Aviation Regulations. There are two basic typesof  tracks:  linear  tracks  and  anchor  tracks.  Occasionally,  a  random,  unpublished  track  is  used  to  meetspecific mission requirements.19.4.1. A linear track (see Figure 19.1) begins at the air refueling initial point (ARIP), continues to theair  refueling  control  point  (ARCP),  and  follows  a  series  of  navigation  check  points  to  the  end  airrefueling exit (AREX) point. This type of track is not necessarily a straight line, and may be comprisedof a series of straight segments with turns along the published route. After a rendezvous on a straighttrack, aircraft are expected to remain as close to the published course as possible.Figure 19.1. Typical Linear Air Refueling Track.19.4.2. An anchor track (see Figure 19.2) consists of a series of points arranged in a racetrack patternwithin a prescribed boundary. The boundary is typically rectangular, but can be any size or shape. Ananchor  point  is  designated  for  tanker  orbit.  Receiver  aircraft  enter  at  the  ARIP  or  a  designated  entrypoint when published. Aircraft must remain within the published boundaries during air refueling.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 19.2. Typical Anchor Refueling Track.365Section 19D— Rendezvous Procedures19.5.  Basics.  There  are  three  basic  types  of  rendezvous:  en  route,  point  parallel,  and  radar  controllerdirected. In all three types the tanker is positioned at a base refueling altitude and the highest receiveraircraft is at least a thousand feet below the tanker. To preclude an altitude conflict, confirm altitudeswith receiver or tanker prior to rendezvous. Regardless of the type of rendezvous, the purpose is to getthe tanker and receiver aircraft joined up at the air refueling control time (ARCT). For point parallel anden route rendezvous, the tanker is responsible for receiver navigation from ARCP until the AREX point.For the radar controller directed rendezvous, responsibility for the rendezvous depends on the situation.Altitude separation between tankers and receivers is critical during the rendevous procedures.19.5.1. En Route Rendezvous. The en route rendezvous is simple, but requires precise time control byboth the tanker and receiver to arrive over the rendezvous point at the same time. There is no designatedorbit point on track for an en route rendezvous, therefore you must use course and speed control to makethe rendezvous control time. The designated rendezvous point is normally the published ARIP.19.5.2. Point Parallel Rendezvous. The point parallel has a designated tanker orbit point at the ARCP(see  Figure  19.3).  When  cleared  to  delay  at  the  ARCP,  the  tanker  sets  up  a  left  hand  racetrack  orbitpattern, remaining within an area 60 NM long by 25 NM wide (see Figure 19.4). The receiver enters thetrack at the ARIP and continues downtrack to the ARCP. It is imperative that the receiver be on courseand airspeed to the ARCP for a successful rendezvous. If all applicable ARTCC clearances have beenobtained, the tanker will turn toward the receiver, establish proper track offset, and continue toward theARIP. To effect the rendezvous, the 25 NM wide area extends down to the ARIP when cleared for airrefueling.  When  reaching  the  appropriate  turn  range  (nose-to-nose  distance),  the  tanker  begins  a  30degree bank left turn to roll out in a position allowing the receiver to maneuver for air refueling. Theprimary means to determine range between aircraft is the air-to-air TACAN. Be prepared to use othermeans to accomplish the rendezvous should the primary equipment fail.366AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 2001Figure 19.3. Point Parallel Rendezvous.Figure 19.4. Point Parallel Rendezvous Tanker Orbit Area.19.5.3.  Radar  Controller  Directed  Rendezvous.  This  type  of  rendezvous  is  typical  for  fighter  typeaircraft refueling in an anchor area where the airspace is controlled by ground or air military radar. Therendezvous can be accomplished several ways.  For instance, the controller  may  assume  responsibilityfor the rendezvous and provide vectors to get the aircraft joined up. In other cases, the controller givesthe tanker or receiver responsibility for the rendezvous. If the tanker is responsible for the rendezvous, itis  typically  a  point  parallel  with  an  orbit  at  the  anchor  point.  If  the  receiver  is  responsible  for  therendezvous, they maneuver from a nose-to-nose aspect while the tanker maintains a constant heading.This is called a fighter turn-on. The radar controller-directed rendezvous often involve multiple sets offighter receivers arriving at different times. All participants must pay close attention to aircraft locationand  altitude  for  potential  conflicts.  Although  the  radar  controller  owns  the  airspace,  aircrews  are  stillresponsible for monitoring navigation and maintaining aircraft separation while in the refueling area.AFPAM11-216        1 MARCH 200136719.6. Weather. During rendezvous closure, bad weather or low visibility can increase the potential of afailed  rendezvous  or  receiver  overrun.  The  effects  of  sun  glare,  cloud  formations,  precipitation,  andvarious other weather phenomena can cause loss of visual contact. The receiver navigator will use radarto identify the tanker but will have no visual backup from the pilots in these circumstances. Successfulcompletion of the rendezvous will depend on the ability of the receiver navigator to direct closure to 1/2NM.  During  refueling,  adverse  weather  can  lead  to  a  dangerous  situation.  The  tanker  navigator  mustmake a concerted effort to maneuver away from these areas by altering course, or altitude, or moving toanother  air  refueling  track.  The  best  time  to  avoid  adverse  weather  begins  during  mission  planning.Unfortunately, after several replanning attempts, you may still encounter severe weather.19.7. Summary. Successful air refueling requires a coordinated effort between tanker and receiver flightcrews  beginning  with  mission  planning.  Crews  must  use  standard  procedures  and  terminology  tocommunicate essential information. Air refueling tracks come in a variety of shapes and sizes; thereforeflight  crews  must  study  FLIP  to  determine  specific  track  requirements.  There  are  several  types  ofrendezvous demanding unique responsibilities of the tanker and receivers. Although the rendezvous isimportant, crews must always remain aware of environmental conditions and human factors that couldjeopardize safety.ROBERT H.
