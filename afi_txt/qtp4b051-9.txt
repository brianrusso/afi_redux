In occupational settings, identifying chemical threats begins with reviewing existing occupational health data in the Defense Environmental Health Readiness System (DOEHRS) or equivalent OEMIS, hazardous material reports and inventories produced by Environmental Management Information System (EMIS), and existing HRA reports.  The basic approach to chemical hazard recognition is to: a.  Determine raw materials. b.  Determine produced product(s). c.  Determine intermediate products formed in the process. d.  Determine by-products potentially being released. e.  Determine (and evaluate) cleaning or maintenance procedures conducted at the end of day, end of run, or changeover to another product. f.  What hazardous waste is produced and how is it disposed?  1.1. Verify ingredients of potential hazard via SDS and/or additional documentation. a.    A chemical is considered hazardous  if it is listed in any of the following: i   Material Safety Data Sheet (SDS) (i.e., if the SDS identifies it as a chemical or physical hazard). ii  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1000 (Toxic and Hazardous Substances: Air Contaminants) Table Z-I through Z-3. iii  Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents in the Work  Environment, American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), current edition.  iv  The Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substance 1.2. Prepare list of potentially hazardous chemicals and constituents (HAZMATS).   2.    Route of entry considerations include: a.     Inhalation •  Physical state (vapor, mist, dust, fume) •  Vapor pressure and boiling point •  Vapor density • • Injection Ingestion b.  Absorption •  Direct contact Indirect contact • •  Vapor or aerosol  8         Journeyman Training Guide:  Chemical Health Hazards AFQTP 4B051-9                             c.
