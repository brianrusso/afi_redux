Purpose.  This instruction provides guidance and procedures for the AF Deployment Health program,  primarily  focusing  on  the  DRHA  Program.  The  purpose  of  the  DRHA  Program  is  to identify and to address Service members’ and civilians’ health care needs related to deployment. DRHAs  assist  with  the  early  identification  and  management  of  deployment-related  health concerns  and  conditions  that  may  surface  in  the  months  before  or  the  months  to  years  after deployment.  As  such,  DRHAs  are  a  vital  component  of  the  Air  Force’s  ability  to  provide effective  care  and  treatment  for  members  with  deployment-related  health  concerns.    The information  provided  in  DRHAs  may  result  in  a  referral  for  additional  health  care  that  may include medical, dental, or behavioral health care or diverse community support services. 1.2.  Overview.  Deployment medical requirements span the pre- and post-deployment cycle and include various requirements, which may vary based on the deployer’s component (e.g., RegAF, ARC,  DAF,  or  contractor).  Note:  Medical  Treatment  Facilities  (MTF)  will  not  process contractors  for  deployment,  unless  the  deploying  individual’s  contract  specifically  states  that medical  services  must  be  provided.  If  the  contract  obligates  the  MTF  to  provide  services, expenses  related  to  providing  contractually  required  deployment-related  medical  clearance services  to  the  deploying  contractor  should  be  applied  (via  journal  voucher)  to  the organization/contingency  that  funded  the  contract.  A  copy  of  the  contract  containing  exact medical  specifications  must  be  provided  to  the  Public  Health/Force  Health  Management (PH/FHM)  Office  prior  to  initiation  of  any  medical  clearance  activities  or  services  IAW  DoDI 3020.41. (T-0). 1.3.  Compliance Areas. 1.3.1.  Deployment  medical  requirements  include  all  medical  requirements  prescribed  for deployments  in  DoDIs,  AFIs,  Combatant  Command  (CCMD)  reporting  instructions,  and other  applicable  policies.    Several  medical  requirements  are  mandated  for  individuals deploying  on  contingency,  exercise,  deployment  (CED)  orders  for  greater  than  30  days  to OCONUS locations with medical support from only non-fixed (temporary) medical facilities. Medical requirements for (1) OCONUS deployments <30 Days, (2) OCONUS deployments to  areas  with  fixed  U.S.  MTFs,  or  (3)  CONUS  deployments  may  be  directed  at  the commander’s  discretion  (CCMD,  Service  component  commanders,  or  commanders exercising operational  control) based on the health threats  identified during the deployment (as described in DoDI 6490.03). 1.3.2.  DoD civilians must comply with the medical, dental, and psychological requirements established by federal law, DoDI and the CCDR responsible for the deployment AOR, both prior  to  and  including  the  entire  period  of  their  deployment.

DRHA #5 – DD Form 2978 (does not apply to DAF Civilians). (T-0). 1.3.5.  DRHA  completion  is  defined  as:  (1)  deployer  completion  of  the  automated  DRHA questionnaire  in  the  designated  information  system  (e.g.  Aeromedical  Services  Information Management System [ASIMS]) and (2) person-to-person encounter (face-to-face encounters are required for DRHAs #1 and #2) with  a DRHA trained health care provider. Encounters should  occur  in  a  private  setting  to  foster  trust  and  openness  in  discussing  sensitive  health concerns. 1.3.5.1.  DRHA  findings  –  identified  as  Critical,  Priority,  Routine,  Negative,  and Incomplete – are tracked in the ASIMS application and must be reviewed and closed by a credentialed,  trained  health  care  provider  within  the  encounter  priority  timeframes specified  in  paragraph  3.3.  Note:  MTF  is  defined  in  this  document  as  a  Military Treatment  Facility  for  RegAF  and  Category  B/E  Individual  Mobilization  Augmentee (IMA)  personnel,  a  Guard  Medical  Unit  (GMU)  for  ANG  members,  and  a  Reserve Medical Unit (RMU) for AFR members. 1.3.5.2.  ARC  members  have  three  (3)  options  for  completing  person-to-person encounters:  (1)  through  the  Reserve  Health  Readiness  Program  (RHRP)-contracted  call center with a credentialed, trained health care provider (for DRHAs #3, #4, #5 only), (2) AFI48-122  18 AUGUST 2014 7 through  a  MTF  with  a  credentialed,  trained  health  care  provider,  or  (3)  with  a credentialed,  trained  ARC  health  care  provider.

Administrative  Change—Change  that  does  not  affect  the  subject  matter  content,  authority, purpose,  application,  and/or  implementation  of  the  publication  (e.g.,  changing  the  POC  name, office symbol(s), correcting misspellings, etc.) Approval  Authority—Senior  leader  responsible  for  contributing  to  and  implementing  policies and  guidance/procedures  pertaining  to  his/her  functional  area(s)  (e.g.,  heads  of  functional  two-letter offices). Air Force Reserve Component—The USAF Air Reserve Component consists of the AFR and ANG.  AFRC  stood  up  as  a  MAJCOM  February  17,  1997.  The  change  in  status,  authorized  by Congress  in  the  Fiscal  1997  National  Defense  Authorization  Act,  was  based  on  the  experience gained from the AFR mobilization for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Authentication—Required  element  to  verify  approval  of  the  publication;  the  approval  official applies his/her signature block to authenticate the publication. The signature block includes the official’s name, rank, and title (not signature). Contingency—A  situation  requiring  military  operations  in  response  to  natural  disasters, terrorists, subversives, or as otherwise directed by appropriate authority to protect US interests. AFI48-122  18 AUGUST 2014 27 Contingency  Deployment—A  deployment  that  is  limited  to  outside  the  continental  United States,  over  30  days  in  duration  and  in  a  location  with  medical  support  from  only  non-fixed (temporary) military MTFs. It is a deployment in which the relocation of forces and material is to an operational area in which a contingency is or may be occurring. Deploymen—t—The relocation of forces and materiel to desired operational areas. Deployment encompasses all activities from origin or home station through destination, specifically including inter-continental  United  States,  inter-theater,  and  intra-theater  movement  legs,  staging,  and holding areas. Geographically  Separated  Units—Any  unit  separated  from  its  servicing  military  personnel flight  beyond  a  reasonable  commuting  distance.  For  ANG  units,  the  term  GSU  is  used synonymous with Independent Unit (IU). Individual  Medical  Readiness—A  means  to  assess  an  individual  Service  member’s,  or  larger cohort’s, readiness level against established metrics applied to key elements of health and fitness to determine medical deployability in support of contingency operations. Medical  Assessment—The total  of the pre-deployment activities described in  Attachment 1 of Enclosure 2 of DoDI 6490.03, Deployment Health. Medical  Treatment  Facility—A  facility  established  for  the  purpose  of  furnishing  medical and/or dental care to eligible individuals. Also called MTF. (JP 1-02. SOURCE: JP 4-02) Person–to–Person DRHA—Face-to-face, by telephone, or video teleconference. Post-Deployment  Health  Assessment—The  PDHA  process  and  screener  (DD  Form  2796, DRHA#2) are conducted within 30 days prior to departure from theater or within 30 days after return from theater. The DD Form 2796 is required if a DD Form 2795 was required during the pre-deployment  phase  and  is  directed  at  the  individual’s  health  status  and  concerns  at redeployment-  the  screening  is  also  used  to  document  health  events  and  enhance  future  force health. Post-Deployment  Health  Reassessment—The PDHRA process and screener (DD Form 2900, DRHA#3)  are  conducted  90-180  days  after  redeployment.  The  PDHRA  is  not  a  psychological screening, but a health risk appraisal modeled after the existing pre- and post- deployment health assessment. Pre-Deployment  Health  Assessment—The  Pre-Deployment  Health  Assessment  process  and screener (DD Form 2795, DRHA#1) are conducted within 60 days of expected deployment date. This  screener  allows  deploying  personnel  to  record  information  about  their  general  health  and report  any  concerns  they  have  prior  to  deployment.  It  also  helps  health  care  providers  identify issues and provide medical care before deployment. Primary  Care  Manager  Team—Provides  appropriate  clinical  and  preventive  healthcare  to enrolled populations and will be supported by the establishment of regional centers of excellence and/or specialized treatment services. Trained  Health  Care  Provider—A physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner that is credentialed, trained, and certified to administer DRHAs. Trained IDMTs may conduct DRHAs  in deployed settings, for personnel assigned to GSUs located greater than 50 miles from an MTF, and  DRHAs  4  or  5  performed  with  the  annual  Mental  Health  Assessment  (ANG  IDMTs  may 28 AFI48-122  18 AUGUST 2014 conduct  DRHAs  ONLY  in  deployed  settings).    An  independently  licensed  mental  health professional may conduct DRHAs #4 and #5, and does not require additional training. Unit  Deployment  Manager—The  UDM  is  a  member  assigned  to  a  unit  that  manages  all deployment readiness, training, and equipment requirements for all deployable personnel within their unit to ensure they are deployment-ready. In addition, UDMs support redeployed personnel in the Redeployment Support Process with commanders of their units.  AFI48-122  18 AUGUST 2014 29 Attachment 2 PRE-DEPLOYMENT MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS CHECKLIST (T-0) A2.1.
