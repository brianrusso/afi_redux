 BY ORDER OF THE  SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 65-202  25 JANUARY 2016 Financial Management  ADMINISTRATION OF A BASE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY ACCESSIBILITY:  Publications and forms are available for downloading or ordering on the e-Publishing website at www.e-Publishing.af.mil. RELEASABILITY:  There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.  OPR:   AFAFO/FMFQ  Supersedes:   AFI65-202, 1 February 2000 Certified by: AFAFO/FMF (Eric I. Cuebas, GS-15) Pages: 48   The purpose of this instruction is to provide general guidance for the Quality Assurance Manager (QAM) to administer the Quality Assurance Program (QAP) in base level financial management (FM)  operations.  The  instruction  outlines  a  dual  approach  to  enhance  the  quality  of  FM operations.  First, this program is directly linked to our Air Force value—“Excellence in All We Do”  and  is  a  visible  commitment  to  superior  performance  and  continuous  improvement  in supporting  America’s  Airmen.      Secondly,  the  program  helps  reinforce  our  obligation  to taxpayers to ensure adequate internal controls are in place to properly safeguard the nation’s and taxpayer  resources.  The  instruction  implements  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  Act  of  1990,  the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) of 1982 to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in  federal  programs,  functions,  and  activities,  OMB  Circular  A-123,  Management’s Responsibility for  Internal Controls, revised 2006, and the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery  Act  (IPERA)  of  2010.  The  program  applies  to,  and  requires  the  compliance  of,  all personnel at command and base levels in financial management activities.

General.  The  Financial  Management  (FM)  organization  is  a  vital  team  in  the  support  of Air  Force  operations  at  installations  across  the  globe.    The  allocation  of  resources  to  meet mission requirements, the responsibility for taking care of the financial needs of our Airmen, and protecting the hard-earned treasure of the American people demand we perform with increasing effectiveness  and  efficiency.    While  evolving  Financial  Improvement  and  Audit  Readiness (FIAR)  requirements,  smaller  staffs,  high  deployment  tempo  and  resource  constraints  provide challenges in our daily operations, FM leaders and staff must sustain high performance levels (T-1).   That  means we must  have a way of measuring our performance and to  continually  assure we’re  meeting  those  standards  of  excellence  across  our  enterprise  (T-1).    The  purpose  of  the Quality  Assurance  Program  (QAP)  is  to  do  just  that;  to  internally  evaluate  our  efficiency  / effectiveness and continually improve.   We do that through compliance based reviews to see if we’re meeting standards, find out who’s doing it best and mirror those best processes across our FM team.   The QAP also provides the FM with reasonable assurance that internal controls are present to ensure taxpayers resources are maximized and Airmen receive their financial support.   6  AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016 Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  Financial  Operations  (SAF/FMP).  SAF/FMP  through the  Air  Force  Accounting  and  Finance  Office  (AFAFO)  Quality  Assurance  Manager  (QAM) provides  Air  Force  FM  QA  policy  and  procedural  guidance.    The  SAF/FMP  QAM  interfaces directly  with  the  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA  QAMs  on  QA  guidance  interpretations,  self-inspection program, taskings, cross-feeds, bulletins, best practices, process improvements, and training.  To facilitate  awareness  and  understanding  between  inspections,  audits  and  internal  controls,  the SAF/FMP QAM also represents SAF/FMP as the FM Functional Area Manager (FAM) for the SAF/IG  Management  Internal  Control  Toolset  (MICT);  and  the  Assessable  Unit  Administrator (AUA), Audit, IG, and Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) focal point to the Air Force Accounting and Finance Office (AFAFO). 2.2.  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA  Financial  Managers.  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA  FMs  through  the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA  QAMs,  support  the  SAF/FMP  QAP  and  provide  command-unique  QA policy  and  procedural  guidance.    The  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA  QAMs  interface  directly  with  the base-level QAMs on QA guidance interpretations, self-inspection program, taskings, cross-feeds, bulletins, best practices, process improvements, training, and, if applicable, staff assistance visits (SAVs).    To  facilitate  awareness  and  efficiencies  between  inspections,  audits  and  internal controls, the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA FAM, AUA, Audit, IG, and FWA focal points. the  MAJCOM  QAMs  should  also  serve  as  or  be  key  advisors to 2.3.  Base-Level  Comptroller  and  Staff.  The  Comptroller  is  responsible  for  the  overall management  and  control  of  the  QAP.  He/she  will  designate  a  highly  competent  person  as  the Quality Assurance Manager (QAM).  Per AFI 38-101, the Comptroller is the direct supervisor of the QAM. The Comptroller must provide the QAM with the resources (i.e. tools, training, time, and  support)  necessary  to  permit  the  QAM  to  be  the  Comptroller’s  independent  advisor  (T-1).  The  FM  staff  (Financial  Services  Officer,  Chief  of  Financial  Analysis,  Superintendent,  etc.) complies  with  the  spirit  and  intent  of  the  QAP  and  motivates  interest  in  the  program  among subordinates.    The  FM  staff  uses  the  QAM  to  perform  independent  reviews  and  analysis  of operations.    They  also  provide  quality  data  for  performance  indicators,  and  if  deficiencies  are identified,  advise  the  FM  and  QAM  of  the  reasons  for  the  discrepancies  and  the  corrective actions taken to preclude recurrence. 2.4.  Base-Level  QAM.  The QAM is  delegated  primary functional  responsibility for the  QAP.  The  QAM  administers  the  QAP  in  accordance  with  this  instruction  and  guidance  from  the Comptroller.   As a key member of the FM staff, the QAM promotes quality consciousness and continuous process improvement among personnel, identifies performance shortfalls and areas of needed training, and works with the Comptroller and staff to develop recommended solutions to improve operational performance.  QAMs must also nurture professional relationships with their MAJCOM  functional  staffs  and  especially  their  MAJCOM  QAM  (T-2).    Successful  QAPs always result from  mutually supportive  relationships  across the  FM team,  shared  responsibility for  meeting  financial  management  standards,  and  continuously  “making  things  better”.      To avoid  conflict  of  interests,  QAMs  must  not  be  assigned  incompatible  additional  duties  (T-1).  The QAM duties are outlined in Figure 2.1. AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016   7  Figure 2.1.

How  to  be  a  Successful  QA  Manager.  “To  give  the  Comptroller  assurance  the organization  is  operating  at  peak  efficiency  while  following  all  applicable  regulations  and preventing  fraud,  waste,  and  abuse”  are  the  watchwords  of  the  QAM.    The  QAM  differs  from any other inspectors and auditors because he/she is part of the base-level FM; part of the same team.  The QAM not only discovers problems before they potentially lessen public confidence, or worse permit  fraud, but  helps  the team  solve faulty, inefficient processes.  A failed QAM is one  who  accepts  verbal  assurances  without  independent  verification,  without  reviewing supporting  documentation.    A  more  successful  QAM  will  apply  the  “show  me”  attitude  to  all compliance issues.  The most successful QAM, however, will not only dig to prove compliance and  find  root  causes,  but  will  also  become  the  team  player  to  help  resolve  the  issues.    This  is what  makes  the  QAM  different  than  the  outsider  inspector,  or  auditor.    This  is  what  permits personnel to be more forthcoming with the problems they are facing.  The successful QAM does not  stop  with  bringing  the  results  of  a  QA  review  to  management’s  attention,  but  helps  train personnel on the deficiencies.  The QAM shows them that he/she is part of the team, part of the solution.  When efficiencies are gained, personnel will see the value of seeking out the help of the QAM. 3.2.  Collaboration.  In order to be an independent advisor to the Comptroller, the QAM cannot afford to  be  caught  in  the organizational  stovepipes we often operate in.    He/she must take the initiative to reach beyond complacency and seek out improvement opportunities, and to be self-motivated to research requirements in areas of unfamiliarity (T-1).  The QAM should gain from the  knowledge  of  fellow  QAMs  faced  with  the  same  challenges.  The  FM  enterprise  gains  its strength  from  the  vast  experience  of  its  people.    The  QAM  must  develop  a  network  of  QA colleagues to collaborate with to harvest the best ideas and ensure QAMs aren’t solving the same problems over and over again (T-2).  The AF FM World-Wide Quality Leadership Professional Forums is a tool for the QAM to develop this professional network to strengthen expertise and discover innovative tools to better serve our Airmen.  Likewise, the QAM must promote a cycle of  success  by  contributing  ideas  and  thoughts  to  their  QA  teammates  (T-2).    Information important  to  the  QAP  will  be  posted  in  Forums  and  in  the  Air  Force  Accounting  and  Finance Office (AFAFO) QA SharePoint (T-1).  Not only do they promote collaboration but these sites serve to improve Air Force-wide metrics, share best practices and root cause analysis, and build better, more targeted training.  The QAM better  serves his/her unit by using these resources to develop this collaborative network. AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016   9  Chapter 4 PROCESS TOOLS 4.1.  General.  Whether  it  is  a  process  improvement  opportunity  or  a  compliance  check,  the QAM  must  have  a  systematic  method  to  organize  and  display  his/her  work  (T-1).    The processing  tools  described  below  help  to  identify  root  causes,  track  performance,  and  to recommend improvements. 4.2.  Performance  Indicators.  Performance  indicators  are  recurring  in  nature  (ex.  monthly  or quarterly),  and  measure  actual  performance  in  an  area  against  a  certain  standard.  The  QAM gathers the data, prepares trend reports, and facilitates discussion with  the personnel  at  the QA meeting.  Performance indicators provide management with  the means to properly assess  areas within  the  FM  organization.    Locally  developed  performance  indicators  should  be  reviewed  at least annually to determine if new ones should be added or any can be deleted.  A sample list of indicators is shown in Figure 4.1. Figure 4.1.  Performance Indicators for Base FM (Sample List). Area                                             Focus Comptroller                                 Government Travel Card Delinquencies Comptroller                                 In House Training FSO                                             Travel Payment Rejects FSO                                             CMS Cases FSO                                             Outstanding Travel Orders FSO                                             In Processing Timeliness FMA                                            O&M Execution FMA                                            Dormant Obligations FMA                                            Resource Advisor Training  4.3.  Discrepancy  Tracking.  As  discrepancies  are  identified,  they  must  be  tracked.  It  is  up  to each  base/MAJCOM  to  determine  the  medium  for  tracking  deficiencies  (T-2);  however, discrepancies identified during IG inspections must be tracked IAW AFI 90-201, par 2.20 (T-2). The  processing  center  chief  determines  the  estimated  completion  date  (ECD)  and  appropriate corrective action, and the QAM assigns the tracking number and ensures the ECD is reasonable. 4.3.1.  The  QAM  will  also  ensure  the  corrective  action  addresses  the  root  cause  of  the discrepancy and not merely an aspect of the problem (T-1).  There are methods available to conduct  root  cause  analysis,  ex.  successive  “why”  questions,  or  Shiska  fishbone  diagram.  Effective problem solving is a key to root cause analysis.  A useful problem-solving tool is the AF 8-Step Problem  Solving Model as outlined in  the AF Smart  Operations for the 21st Century https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC13515C0FB5E044080020E329A9.  To  help  define  our  terms  and  permit  an  objective,  measurable  approach  to  root  cause analysis, QAMs are encouraged to use Deficiency Cause Codes and Explanations defined in AFI  90-201,  Table  A7.1.    The  QAM  and  processing  center  chief  can  add  additional explanations to make the root cause clearer.  At times the root cause will be other than those (AFSO21) playbook.    10  AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016 defined in Table A7.1.  The QAM will label these as “OT1” or “Other” and provide the root cause analysis explanation (T-2). 4.3.2.  Tracking is initiated for discrepancies or problems identified from numerous sources: self-inspection  questions,  quality  assurance  reviews,  cross-feed  items  (audit  reports, Inspector General Reports, etc.). 4.3.3.  Various  MAJCOMs  have  command  specific  discrepancy  tracking  forms.  If  one  is designated at  your installation, use that form and follow your command guidance in how to open and track local discrepancies.  Ensure the minimally required tracking information from attachment 2 is included in, or attached to, the form 4.4.  Discrepancy  Tracking  Report  (T-2).  Give  top  priority  to  ensure  all  open  discrepancies are  aggressively  worked  until  completion.  A  Discrepancy  Tracking  Report  (See  Figure  4.2.)  is compiled monthly and provided to management for review. This report provides the FM with a quick summary of problem tracking efforts.

Quality Assurance Review (QAR) .  The QAR is a means to provide the Comptroller with an independent  review of an area.    It  can be  as simple as a quick  compliance spot check or  as involved as a multi-page study.   The QAR meets three objectives: (1) determines if a problem exists  or  still  exists,  (2)  if  a  problem  exists,  examines  the  root  cause  of  the  problem,  and  (3) AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016   11  makes recommendations to  correct  the problem.   There are mandatory  elements  to  a QAR, but the QAM can also choose optional elements depending on the need. 4.5.1.  Optional.  QAR  In-Brief.    If  the  issue  is  complicated,  lengthy,  requires  common understanding, or requires a great deal of cooperation with other personnel, the QAM should consider a QAR in-brief.  The purpose of the in-brief is to agree on the specific area(s) to be reviewed,  and  to  determine  the  time  period  of  the  analysis.  The  QAR  in-brief  is  usually attended by the QAM, Comptroller, flight chief and applicable section chief whose area will be reviewed. 4.5.2.  Mandatory. QAR Reason/Background (T-2). 4.5.3.  Mandatory. Area Reviewed. For example, FMA, Military Pay, etc. (T-2) 4.5.4.  Optional. Period of Study. 4.5.5.  Optional. Actual Hours Spent on Study. 4.5.6.  Mandatory. Documents Reviewed. Specify the documents reviewed for possible audit follow-up (T-2). 4.5.7.  Mandatory.  Findings.    State  the  results  of  the  QAR  objectively  and  in  relevant statistical  terms.    For  example,  27  of  45  (60%)  or  $573,987.57  of  $1,017,895.76  (56%) sampled anticipated reimbursements were not supported by valid customer orders (T-2). 4.5.8.  Mandatory. Root  causes  analysis if problems  are found.   If root causes have already been  identified  through  discrepancy  tracking,  self  inspection,  audit  findings,  etc.  the  QAR need  only  ensure  the  root  cause  is  still  valid.    Refer  to  4.3.1.  for  root  cause  analysis requirements (T-2). 4.5.9.  Mandatory.  Recommendations.    Recommend  corrective  action,  future  requirements, next steps, or any changes.  The QAM and the applicable section chief or supervisor should agree upon the recommended actions; however, the Comptroller relies upon the integrity and objectivity of the QAM in recommending a valid solution (T-2). 4.5.10.  Optional.  QAR  Out-Brief.    The  QAM  should  consider  an  out-brief  with  the applicable personnel if an in-brief was conducted, or the complexity of the QAR increased.  This will help ensure a complete understanding of the QAR results. 4.5.11.  An example of the completed QAR report is shown in figure 4.3 Note that the QAR report is presented in a concise and clear manner for the Comptroller and staff.   12  AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016 Figure 4.3.  Example of a Quality Assurance Review Memo.                                                                                                                                                 30 Sep xx MEMORANDUM FOR FM  FROM: QA  SUBJECT: Quality Assurance Review FY14-15: Aged Cases in CMS  Background: FM is concerned with increasing number of aged cases in CMS  Area Reviewed: FMF  Period of Study: 1 Jul 13 to 15 Sep 13 Actual Hours Spent on Study: 32  Documentation Reviewed: Random cases, case #3540208,  case #5876456,  case #9039758, case #4309129, case #2949024, case #5094632, case #1239567,  case #9078964, case #2948453, case #0834567, case #2768430,  case #2949701, case #2940197, case #8673452, in CMS with corresponding MMPAs  Findings: A problem does exist with overly aged cases in CMS.  33% of cases reviewed should have been closed because no further action required on MMPA (member paid correctly).  15% of CMS case reviewed were annotated with remarks making it unclear as to action taken and what was needed.  Root Causes: Deficiency Cause Code TR7, hands-on training inadequate.  (1) Once problem resolved, cases were not being properly closed in CMS because technicians did not understand CMS case closure procedures.  (2) Annotations in CMS lacked clarity needed for the next organization to take action because technicians did not understand the impact of their remarks.   Recommendations: (1) Train technicians on how to properly close CMS cases once MMPA is corrected and member is being paid correctly.  (2) Train personnel on annotating CMS with make clear, detailed remarks to allow follow-on action by outside agencies.    /s/ I.M. STICKLER MSgt, USAF Quality Assurance Manager  4.5.12.  Recommendations to conduct a QAR can be made by the Comptroller, staff or QAM. SAF/FM, AFAFO, and/or MAJCOM can direct QARs for high interest areas. AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016   13  4.5.13.  The  QAM  must  schedule  and  conduct  QARs  based  on  local  needs;  however,  there are  several  “trust  but  verify”  QARs  that  are  mandatory  (T-1).  These  generally  take  a  short time to conduct because the QAM can rely on a small sample size to determine if corrective actions are firmly in place. Figure 4.4.  QAR Schedule Matrix. QAR Schedule  If the source is                                                           Conduct the QAR (See Note) Discrepancy Tracking Medium                                  180 days after close-out date                                                                                       A finding from a local audit report                             180 days after closure date of management comments                                                                                      A cross-fed item from SAF or MAJCOM                  Immediately  Directed by SAF or MAJCOM                                   By suspense date of tasking  Local policy letters                                                     90 days after date of policy letter  FM discretion                                                             When directed by the Comptroller  Note:  If item is validated on a current self-inspection, a redundant QAR is not necessary.  The self-inspection validation must be accomplished within a 30 days of the schedule QAR.  Likewise if an item is validated on a QAR, a redundant self inspection is not necessary. 4.6.  Process Improvement Team.  Another method to improve operations is through the use of teams.  Even if standards are being met, the team process breaks down the existing procedures and looks for ways to streamline or improve the overall process. Discussions during QA or other staff  meetings  are  ideal  times  to  initiate  a  team  review.    The  team’s  composition  may  include members  from  other  agencies  that  are  involved  in  the  study  (i.e.  personnel,  transportation, contracting, etc.). 4.7.  Quality Assurance Meetings.  A face-to-face QA meeting is required at least monthly (T-1). The meeting is a means to focus on QA efforts at the comptroller organization. It allows the section  chiefs  an  opportunity  to  state  the  health  of  their  operations  directly  to  the  Comptroller. The meeting is also a good forum to understand the current issues in the other areas. 4.7.1.  The  QAM  ensures  that  any  problems  or  disagreements  with  tools,  such  as performance indicator charts, discrepancy tracking reports, and training reports are resolved before the meeting. The QAM serves as facilitator for the meeting and the Comptroller is the chairman. Mandatory topics to cover include, but are not limited to, the following areas: 4.7.2.  Section chiefs address each of their performance indicators.  They note root causes for problem areas and provide recommendations to reverse negative trends. 4.7.3.  Action  items  should  be  developed  for  each  below  standard  indicator  to  include scheduling training.   14  AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016 4.7.4.  The QAM should review training efforts and QARs conducted or planned that month.  Scheduling reviews will minimize interruptions and impact on the section. 4.7.5.  Review all open discrepancies to ensure completion is on schedule (T-1). 4.8.  QA  Meeting  Minutes.  Minutes  of  the  QA  meeting  must  be  written,  published,  and distributed to the Comptroller and staff within five business days (T-2). Minutes should include action items identified at the meeting, responsible parties, and estimated completion dates. AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016   15  Chapter 5 SELF-INSPECTION PROGRAM 5.1.  General.  A  comprehensive  Self-Inspection  Program  is  another  important  element  of internal controls and Quality Assurance.  A checklist review will be conducted within all areas to evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  existing  procedures,  the  strength  of  internal  controls,  and  to determine compliance with regulatory and policy requirements (T-1).  The SAF/FM checklist is posted in both the AFAFO QA SharePoint and the SAF/IG Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT).  All base-level FM units must use the SAF/FM checklist (T-1). 5.2.  Reviewer.  The  FM  decides  which  personnel  conduct  the  actual  checklist  reviews.    The reviews  give  section  chiefs  first-hand  knowledge  of  their  operations,  although  they  may  not necessarily  conduct  the  review.    Encourage  cross-utilizing  FM  personnel  from  other  sections, tenant  units, nearby ANG sites, etc; the more independent  the reviewer,  the more objective the review.    However,  in  order  to  fulfill  validation  responsibilities,  the  QAM  will  not  be  tasked  to perform the checklist reviews (T-1). 5.3.  Frequency.  Reviews will be conducted semi-annually using the checklist discussed in 5.1 (T-1).  The FM determines what months they will be due unless local installation policy directs otherwise. 5.4.  QAM Role.  The QAM oversees the progress for completing the self-inspection checklists and ensures that  responses adequately  reflect  the actual health of each area.  The QAM should encourage truthful answers even if problems are identified. 5.5.  Substitution  of  Responses.  If there are recent responses to an earlier review (i.e. a cross-feed item, a QAR, an audit, etc.), the response can be substituted for a self-inspection checklist response if it occurred within 30 days. 5.6.  Validation  of  Self-Inspection  Responses.  Validation  provides  reasonable  assurance  that the reviews were conducted properly.  The QAM validates at least 10% of inspection  checklist responses; however, numerous inadequate responses may warrant the validation of the remaining responses (T-1).   Validation can also provide additional focus to a high interest item designated by  the  Comptroller  and  FM  staff.    The  QAM  validation  of  self-inspection  checklists  is accomplished through the use of a QAR (Chapter 4).   16  AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016 Chapter 6 CROSS-FEED PROGRAM 6.1.  General.  Today’s  environment  of  electronic  communications  enhances  exporting information  throughout  the  financial  management  community.  The  QAM  will  be  cross-fed various reports and bulletins on a routine basis through electronic means. In turn, the QAM takes action or distributes the information accordingly (T-1). 6.1.1.  Findings from other locations. In the operational world, an aircraft accident generates a “one-time investigation” at other installations to see if a similar problem exists. In the same manner,  the  financial  community  must  share  information  when  things  go  wrong  (T-1).  For example, if an IG or audit visit at one Comptroller organization identifies discrepancies that degrade  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting,  effectiveness  or  efficiency  of  operations,  or compliance with applicable laws and regulations, then internal controls may be lacking. The ability to cross-feed problem areas is an important element of the overall QAP and enhances effective internal controls. 6.1.1.1.  Upon receipt of a negative cross-feed report, the QAM does the following (T-1): 6.1.1.1.1.  Conducts a QAR IAW instructions found in this AFI. 6.1.1.1.2.  If the problem does not exist locally, then reports the QAR normally. 6.1.1.1.3.  If  a  problem  does  exist,  the  QAM  notifies  the  FM,  Flight  Chief  and applicable section chief who opens a discrepancy. 6.1.1.1.4.  The  QAM  then  tracks  the  discrepancy  through  the  Discrepancy  Tracking Report. 6.1.1.1.5.  Report results of the QAR if requested by higher headquarters. 6.2.  Good  Ideas  and  Initiatives.  The financial management network consists of very talented individuals who come up with great ideas and initiatives to improve their local operations.  Use AFAFO QA SharePoint, FM Quality Leadership Professional Forums, or MAJCOM web-sites as central repositories of QA cross-feeds and information. Positive cross-feed items will, therefore, be provided to the QAM on a routine basis. The QAM role in this regard is: 6.2.1.  Search for solutions from other sources. 6.2.2.  Distribute the information to the right people. 6.2.3.  Forward good ideas from your local operations so others can benefit. 6.2.4.  Present a periodic QA award (team or individual) (T-3).  The purpose is to recognize and boost morale because management takes the time to notice good performance. Whenever possible, cash incentives for civilian employees or time off for military should be presented at staff or QA meetings. 6.3.  Local  Cross-Feed  Program.  The  QAM  is  encouraged  to  develop  a  local  cross-feed program  independent  from  the  Air  Force  distributed  program  by  searching  for  reports  or products to share locally within the comptroller organization. AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016   17  Chapter 7 FRAUD PREVENTION  7.1.  General (T-1) .  Fraud prevention and detection is the highest priority in the QA Program.  The  QAM  is  the  focal  point  for  fraud  prevention  and  awareness  in  the  FM  organization.    The following paragraphs describe these responsibilities and the characteristics of fraud in financial management. 7.2.  Education  (T-1).  The  QAM  is  responsible  for  fraud  awareness  education.  There  are several methods to use throughout the year in raising and maintaining fraud awareness. 7.2.1.  Schedule  FM  newcomers  for  introductory  briefings  on  local  fraud  prevention measures. 7.2.2.  Distribute cross-feed items relating to fraud. Insight can be gained by studying fraud cases, even if they did not occur in the Air Force. 7.2.3.  Schedule annual Fraud, Waste, and Abuse briefings. 7.2.4.  Fraud indicators.  These are common indicators from FM-related fraud cases. Evaluate these against the QAM’s own environment and promote awareness of these in the training. 7.2.4.1.  Reluctance to leave office – doesn’t take leave 7.2.4.2.  Involved in excessive gambling – living beyond means 7.2.4.3.  Financial problems suddenly resolved 7.2.4.4.  Declines career opportunities 7.2.4.5.  Close association with suppliers 7.2.4.6.  Altered Documents 7.2.4.7.  Missing approval signatures 7.2.4.8.  Duplicate claims – complaints of not being paid 7.2.4.9.  False claims – BAH, Dependent PCS 7.2.4.10.  “Phony looking” receipts 7.2.4.11.  Supervisors too busy to pay attention to details 7.2.4.12.  Rapid turnover of personnel 7.2.4.13.  Highly computerized organization 7.2.4.14.  Extreme familiarity with operations 7.2.4.15.  Inexperienced personnel in key positions 7.3.  Collusion.  Collusion is a secret agreement between two or more persons for a fraudulent or deceitful purpose.  In today’s environment, we can safely conclude that no one person controls a process  from  start  to  finish;  however,  we  have  no  foolproof  safeguards  against  collusion.    It  is our most vulnerable area in financial management fraud prevention.   18  AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016 7.3.1.  Comptroller  Access  Guide  (CAG)  compliance  (see  Attachment  3).    Air  Force financial  managers  utilize  multiple  financial  management  systems  with  manpower  too limited to support the system access separations possible in the larger Defense Finance and Accounting  Service  (DFAS)  sites.    The  keystone  of  the  negotiated  position  between  the DFAS  system  owners  and  the  Air  Force  systems  users  is  based  upon  the  Comptroller’s review  and  signature  attesting  that  adequate  internal  controls  are  in  place  over  the  multiple systems  access.    To  lessen  the  risk  of  collusion,  financial  managers  must  comply  with  the system access  limitations directed in  the CAG (T-1).   If the CAG rules are not  followed, it does not necessarily mean someone has all the accesses needed to commit fraud; however, it does mean one less person is needed for collusion. 7.3.2.  Review  coverage  (T-1).  The  QAM  must  check  for  FWA  in  every  review  and  audit conducted. The QAM must explore processes with an eye toward fraud vulnerabilities in the process.    Further,  the  QAMs  various  reviews  and  audits  must  serve  as  a  deterrent  to collusion.  To be an effective deterrent, members must understand that their work is subject to constant surveillance.  For example, when a QAM reviews a sample of work, the sample must be truly random in that every transaction has an equal possibility of being reviewed. 7.4.  Reporting (T-1).  If you suspect fraud, ensure your leadership is quickly made aware of the situation.    Specifically  notify  the  Flight  Chief  and  the  Comptroller  of  the  circumstances  unless this compromises your case.  Be familiar with the many agencies that can assist you: 7.4.1.  Air Force Office of Special Investigations. 7.4.2.  Security Forces Investigative Unit. 7.4.3.  Air Force Audit Agency. 7.4.4.  Wing Inspector General. 7.4.5.  Department of Defense Inspector General. 7.4.6.  Staff Judge Advocate (local legal office). Reference the QA Handbook, Tab L, for detailed contact information and fraud reporting experiences. AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016   19  Chapter 8 CONTROL MONITORING ACTIVITIES 8.1.  Financial  Managers  Records  Reviews  (T-1).  To  support  the  great  trust  placed  on financial managers as stewards of public funds,  internal  financial records reviews are  required. The Financial Services Officer (FSO) performs and documents various reviews on assigned FM personnel  to  ensure  only  authorized  entitlements  and  payments  are  made.    The  QAM’s responsibility is  to  follow-up with  an independent  validation of these reviews.  At a minimum, the FSO audits the records of personnel specified in the following paragraphs; however, the FSO can review any or all FM personnel to establish a reasonable assurance against fraud. 8.1.1.  Military Pay, Pay Record Accessibility (PRA).  An audit of military pay for specified FM personnel will be accomplished IAW AFMAN 65-116V1, 1.2.1. 8.1.2.  Civilian Pay PRA. An audit of civilian time and leave for host FM civilian personnel with  update  access  to  the  civilian  pay  entitlement  system  (Defense  Civilian  Pay  System  -DCPS), and their on-station civilian employee relatives, will be conducted IAW Attachment 4, A4.1.2. 8.1.3.  Travel Pay PRA. An audit of travel claims for all FM military and civilian personnel, and specified relatives, will be accomplished IAW the procedures in Attachment 4, A4.1.3. 8.2.  Financial  Management  Operational  Controls  (T-0).  Properly  assigned  roles  and responsibilities  are  the  foundation  of  FM  operational  controls.    Strict  control  is  also  necessary because many FM roles and responsibilities carry pecuniary liability.  Through requirements in the self inspection program and periodic reviews, FM will monitor control by ensuring personnel in key roles are properly assigned.  DoDFMR Vol 5, Ch 33 is enacted by the Air Force for the positions in the following paragraphs. 8.2.1.  Voucher  Certifying  Officers.    A  voucher  certifying  officer  attests  to  the  facts  and validity  of  a  payment  voucher.    Voucher  certifying  officers  are  pecuniarily  liable  for  this duty.  This means they must repay any monies lost on improper vouchers for which they did not maintain adequate internal controls. 8.2.1.1.  Voucher  certifying  officers  must  be  adequately  trained  and  appointed  on  DD Form  577.    The  DD  Form  577  must  include  specific  responsibilities,  applicable regulation  references,  training  requirements,  acknowledgement  of  liability,  rights  to request  relief,  appointing  authority  signature,  and  accountable  official  signature.    The voucher certifying officer is considered appointed until relieved in writing.  See AFAFO QA SharePoint for an example DD Form 577. 8.2.1.2.  The  host  base  Comptroller  is  the  appointing  authority  for  voucher  certifying officers.    The  United  States  Property  and  Fiscal  Officer  (USP&FO)  is  the  appointing authority for ANG voucher certifying officers. 8.2.1.3.  Control  monitoring  of  voucher  certifying  officers  is  maintained  by  review  of Certifying Officer Legislation (COL) training certificate, and DD Form 577.  This review is part of the self inspection checklist.   20  AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016 8.2.2.  Departmental  Accountable  Officials.    Personnel  who  provide  data,  services,  or information  upon  which  a  voucher  certifying  officer  relies  upon  to  certify  a  payment  are considered  departmental  accountable  officials  (DAOs).    DAOs  are  pecuniary  liable  for improper payments resulting from their negligence.  This means the government can look to the  DAO  to  repay  all  monies  lost  resulting  from  negligence  in  the  performance  of  their accountable duties. 8.2.2.1.  The  DAO  appointment  process  is  the  same  as  8.2.1.1.  See  AFAFO  QA SharePoint for an example DD Form 577. 8.2.2.2.  The  voucher  certifying  officer  will  determine  who  he  relies  upon  for  DAO support  and  request  DAO  appointment  of  that  individual.    SAF/FMP  (AFAFO)  will determine categories of personnel to be appointed as DAOs.  The appointee’s commander will  be  the  appointing  official  on  the  DD  Form  577.    SAF/FMP  (AFAFO)  will  support DFAS voucher certifying officers by determining categories of personnel to be appointed as  DAOs  to  support  DFAS  payments.    Military  pay  entitlement  document  certifying officers,  unless  already  appointed  as  a  voucher  certifying  officer,  will  be  appointed  as DAOs. 8.2.2.3.  The control monitoring activity is the same as 8.2.1.3. 8.2.3.  Funds  Certifying  Officials.      The  funds  certifying  officials  carry  responsibilities  per the Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA), referenced in the DoDFMR Vol 14, and therefore will not be appointed as DAOs (see DoDFMR Vol 5, 330306).  See AFAFO QA SharePoint for an example appointment letter. 8.2.4.  Comptroller Access Guide (CAG).  Properly assigned accesses to financial systems is critical to FM operational control.  Refer to the CAG in Attachment 3 for control monitoring procedures.    Following  the  CAG  ensures  that  personnel  have  only  the  authorized  level  of access, access to multiple systems is justified, and user accounts for departing (reassignment, separation, or retirement) personnel are purged. 8.3.  Mandatory  Reviews,  Audits,  and  Validations  (T-1).  To  achieve  and  sustain  audit readiness in a limited resource environment, SAF/FM must have the flexibility to quickly draw focus to  different  control areas.  To this end, SAF/FM (AFAFO) will periodically send control monitor taskings to installation QAMs through MAJCOM/FMs to cover Financial Improvement and  Audit  Readiness  (FIAR)  requirements  and  any  items  of  interest.    To  give  SAF/FM reasonable  assurance  FM  internal  controls  are  being  met  across  the  Air  Force;  certain  reviews, audits,  and  validations  must  be  performed  on  a  continuous  basis  as  detailed  in  Attachment  4, A4.2.    These  taskings  are  kept  at  a  minimum  to  give  maximum  flexibility  for  the  QAM  to conduct  additional  reviews  needed  to  assess  organizational  performance.    Use  Attachment  4, A4.2 for ideas on how to accomplish local reviews. AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016   21  Chapter 9 THE QUALITY ASSURANCE PLAN AND HANDBOOK 9.1.  QA  Plan  (T-1).  A  mandatory  Quality  Assurance  Plan  becomes  the  means  to  capture  and organize the elements of the QA Program. Prepared annually, the QAM and FM staff chart out what  areas  will  be  covered  during  the  fiscal  year.    The  Comptroller  approves  the  plan  and reviews  it  monthly  with  the  QAM  to  ensure  all  planned  activities  are  achieved  or  approve  any revisions.    The  QA  plan  is  frequently  modified  as  the  process  tools  capture  and  record  any problems,  discrepancies,  or  improvement  opportunities.    See  Figure  9.1  and  Tab  A  of  the QAM’s Handbook in the AFAFO QA SharePoint for examples of QA plans. 9.2.  QA Manager Handbook (T-1).  The QA Manager Handbook is a mandatory requirement.   It  allows  the  QAM  to  store  QA  products  in  an  organized  manner  for  prompt  retrieval  for inspectors, auditors, and investigators.  Figure 9.2 lists the required items for the handbook.  The QA Handbook items may linked and stored electronically as long as they are properly referenced and  allow  for  prompt  retrieval.    The  AFAFO  QA  SharePoint  will  include  instructions  and examples  of  items  in  the  QA  Manager’s  Handbook.    Maintain  and  dispose  of  items  in  the  QA Handbook IAW AFMAN 37-139, Table 65-31.   22  AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016 Figure 9.1.  Example of a QA Plan.

General.  The  QAP  identifies  potential  weaknesses  or  problems  while  training  improves overall  performance.    QAMs  should,  therefore,  also  have  the  role  of  FM  Training  Managers  if workload permits.  The training referred to in this chapter is not the “upgrade” or external type of training.  Rather, the focus of this chapter is on the in-house training program.  If the Comptroller chooses not to appoint the QAM as FM training manager, the requirements described below are still applicable. 10.2.  Role  of  QAM  in  Training.  The  QAM  should  facilitate  the  identification  of  training requirements,  ensure  training  is  conducted  and  documented,  and  validate  training  sessions  to ensure they are effective. 10.3.  Training Topics.  Determining training topics is a process based on several factors. 10.3.1.  New  Procedures.    FM  functions  change  over  time.    When  those  changes  occur, training  should  be  scheduled  to  ensure  personnel  understand  the  changes  and  have  an opportunity to ask questions in a less stressful environment. 10.3.2.  Updated systems.  Upgrades to financial automated systems are a fact of life.  When these  systems  changes  are  brought  on-line,  a  training  session  should  be  scheduled  with  a “dummy”  database  whenever  possible.    Workers  learn  better  by  making  mistakes  in  a  safe environment. 10.3.3.  Computer  application  courses.    Whenever  possible,  seek  to  schedule  classes  that improve  general  computer  knowledge  and  skills.    Look  for  in  house  experts  that  can supplement computer training. 10.3.4.  Performance Deficiencies.  A prime source for training topics  are the discrepancies noted in  various  reviews (self-inspection checklists, QARs, etc.).  The QAM should ensure that as discrepancies are identified a corresponding training session should be conducted if it helps resolve the discrepancy. 10.3.5.  Orientation training.  QAMs will provide newcomers with a short orientation to the FM  mission,  organizational  structure,  responsibilities  of  the  different  sections,  and  an overview of the QA and In House Training Programs. 10.3.6.  Use of self-inspection checklists.  Another valuable source for training topics is the area’s  self-inspection  review  checklists.    A  checklist  question  or  two  can  be  given  to personnel  in  the work areas (especially  young enlisted technicians).  Task them  to  assist  in preparing and presenting a training class on that specific area of the checklist. 10.4.  Training  Plan    (T-1).  Based  on  inputs  received,  the  QAM  prepares  a  monthly  training plan  that  summarizes  what  topics  are  scheduled  for  in-house  training  (Figure  10.1).    The  plan should  be  provided  to  the  Comptroller  and  staff  for  review  and  an  opportunity  to  suggest  any additional training topics. AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016   25  Figure 10.1.

Training Report (T-1).  The QAM produces a monthly training report that confirms what training sessions indeed took place (Figure 10.2.).  It should be compared to the training plan to determine if scheduled training is occurring. Figure 10.2.  Sample November Training Report.

Where  to  Conduct  Training.  Whenever  possible,  training  should  be  conducted  away from the work environment.  A training room should be designated that is neat, conducive to a professional  training  environment,  and  has  adequate  resources  to  conduct  a  training  session (marker board, overhead projector, etc.). 10.7.  Trainer.  Experienced personnel  who are able to  effectively communicate with  other co-workers  should  teach  training  sessions.    However,  if,  per  10.3.6.,  inexperienced  personnel  are given an opportunity to train, the QAM must ensure they are assisted and set up for success. 10.8.  Documentation  (T-1).  Upon  completion  of  the  training,  the  QAM  must  receive  an attendance sheet signed by all that attended the session, topic overview sheet that lists objectives, and lesson plans developed. 10.9.  Validating  Training  Effectiveness  (T-1).  The  last  step  in  ensuring  that  training  is effective  is  for  the  QAM  to  validate  training  sessions  on  a  random  basis.    Too  often,  training programs  fail  to  meet  their  objectives.    As  the  “eyes  and  ears”  for  the  Comptroller,  the  QAM randomly selects and attends training sessions to determine that (1) training sessions are in fact occurring, and (2) that the sessions are productive. 10.9.1.  The  QAM  makes  an  objective  assessment  on  the  effectiveness  of  training  sessions through the use of a training validation sheet (Figure 10.3).  The validation “closes the loop” on the training program for the Comptroller. Figure 10.3.  Sample Training Validation Worksheet. Training Session:  Receiving Reports – Requirements for Proper Payments  Date/Time:  30 Nov 13/0900  Trainer:  SrA Robertson  Overall Evaluation:      Excellent  X     Fair __      Marginal __    Unsatisfactory __  Comments:  I sat in on the training sessions on receiving report requirements for proper payments.  The session was scheduled at a convenient time for personnel and was conducted in the training room.  SrA Robertson gave a concise training session on the subject.  He distributed copies of the guidance which stated the seven requirements for a proper receiving report.  He went over each item and gave examples of proper and improper documentation.  SrA Robertson then ended his session with numerous examples and asked the class to determine if the receiving report was proper or not.

The CAG is concerned with the internal controls associated with access to our financial management systems.  This guide is issued in conjunction with  previously  established  policy  and  procedures  for  systems  access.    The  CAG  provisions apply to Air Force FM systems users.  DFAS users will continue to follow their own security and systems  access  requirements.    The  CAG  is  only  concerned  with  the  accesses  which  update systems.    Any  inquiry-only  or  view-only  system  access  does  not  require  special  CAG  waiver.  Whenever  the  term  “CAG  waiver”  is  required  by  any  of  the  following  paragraphs,  these procedures must be followed: A3.1.1.  Initial Approval (T-1).  Follow Attachment 5 for DEAMS Access. A3.1.1.1.  User  will  initiate  request  for  system  access  on  System  Authorization  Access Request (SAAR) , DD Form 2875 per normal procedures. A3.1.1.2.  Terminal  Area  Security  Officer  (TASO)  or  Security  Administrator  (Sec Admin) or equivalent will: A3.1.1.2.1.  Review  the  request  per  their  normal  policy  and  procedures  to  ensure system control and separation of duties. A3.1.1.2.2.  Not allow excessive system access as identified in par. A3.3 below. A3.1.1.2.3.  Coordinate  the  request  with  the  Quality  Assurance  (QA)  manager  to ensure  there  are  no  conflicts  with  other  accounting,  entitlement,  or  disbursing systems. A3.1.1.3.  QAM:  If there is a multi-system access conflict, the QAM will: A3.1.1.3.1.  Advise and assist the user and management to explore all alternatives.  It is  imperative  CAG  waiver  be  used  cautiously  and  sparingly  due  to  internal  control vulnerabilities in regards to multiple systems accesses. A3.1.1.3.2.  If  the  decision  is  to  pursue  CAG  waiver,  the  QAM  will  work  with management to complete the “Request for Multiple Access” form, (see Figure A3.1.). Annotating  compensating  controls  is  vital.    Sound  internal  controls  warrant  the compensating  controls  should  not  be  more  costly  than  enforcing  the  separation  of duties. A3.1.1.4.  Host Base Comptroller (AFFSC Director for AFFSC) will: A3.1.1.4.1.  Approve  the  multiple  accesses  by  signing  the  Request  for  Multiple Access form and the DD Form 2875. A3.1.1.4.2.  The  importance  of  the  comptroller’s  approval  in  this  process  cannot  be overemphasized.    It  is  a  statement  to  the  system’s  owner  there  are  no  reasonable alternatives to the multiple accesses.  The comptroller takes responsibility for controls over the user’s systems actions and measures are in place to prevent fraud. AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016   31  A3.1.1.4.3.  More stringent controls must be followed when the disbursing system is involved.    The  Disbursing  Officer  (DO)  and  the  MAJCOM  are  involved  in  the approval process. A3.1.2.  Monitor  (T-1):    Monitoring  internal  controls  are  the  key  to  ensuring  systems accesses are proper and fraud is prevented. A3.1.2.1.  TASO/Sec Admin or equivalent is: A3.1.2.1.1.  Primarily  responsible  for  accesses  to  their  systems.    Per  their  operating instructions they will periodically reconcile the actual system access with supporting documentation  to  account  for  all  personnel  with  update  access,  account  for  all  DD Form 2875s, and account for the correct access level.  If operating instructions do not specify this reconciliation, it will be accomplished quarterly.  If the system does not have  a  local  TASO/Sec  Admin,  the  FSO  or  the  FMA  chief  will  perform  this reconciliation based on system applicability. A3.1.2.1.2.  Whether  through  view-only  access  and/or  review  of  original,  source documents,  it  is  important  that  the  QAM  can  validate  system  access  reconciliations with  confidence that data was not  subject  to  manipulation.   For example, the DFAS Systems Security will directly respond to the QA managers request for any applicable systems access reports. A3.1.2.2.  QAM will: A3.1.2.2.1.  Validate  the  TASO/Sec  Admin  is  reconciling  system  access  with supporting  documentation,  both  for  personnel  accountability  and  correct  level  of access. A3.1.2.2.2.  Cross  check  the  TASO/Sec  Admin  reconciliations  to  ensure  no unauthorized  multiple  system  accesses,  and  that  authorized  multiple  systems  access are properly documented, justified, and approved.  Monitor and test the compensating controls specified in the Request for Multiple Access. A3.1.2.2.3.  Validations will be conducted on a no-notice basis to the greatest extent possible,  but  at  least  semiannually  the  QAM  will  produce  a  written  report  to  the comptroller  with  the  results  of  the  previous  three  items  and  an  assessment  of  the system access internal controls health. A3.1.2.2.4.  Ensure  all  departing/reassigned  FM’ers  with  systems  access  update capability  out  process  through  the  QAM.    System  access  should  be  terminated immediately upon separation, retirement or PCS.  This task will be performed by the TASO/Sec  Admin  at  AFFSC,  and  the  AFFSC  QAM  will  validate  and  specifically note  this  task  during  their  review.    Un-deleted  accesses  continue  to  be  one  of  our biggest deficiencies.   32  AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016 A3.2.  Disbursing, Accounting, Entitlement Systems: If And multiple access is requested between     (note 1) member is assigned to    Disbursing System Accounting System Entitlement System (Note 2)   FM FM FM AFFSC AFFSC   X X   X X     X X   X   X   X X   Than CAG waiver is required     Y Y Y Y Y And is approved by  (both when two “X”s) Notes Comptroller  Disbursing Officer AFFSC Command    X X X       X X   X X er         X X   X   Note 3 Note 4 Note 5 Note 3 Note 4 Note 5      X Y   X  IAPS(9) for vendor pay.  This is the only access level authorized for base- DJMS and DMO for military pay  IATS for travel pay AFFSC  Note 1:  Any "view only" access to systems or data retrieval only systems (ex. CRIS) does not require CAG waiver.  The current disbursing system is defined as CDS.  The current accounting system is defined as GAFS/BQ.  DEAMS constitutes a combined accounting and entitlement system.  The current entitlement systems are:  level operations      DCPS for civilian pay    RTS for travel pay, FM personnel with DTS DTA rights, and the FM DTS certifying/approving official.   DTS for travel pay.  Voucher certifying officers in DTS cannot have BQ. However, the FMA orders approving official for CED orders may have DTS and BQ access.   Note 2:  CAG waiver is not required for access to more than one entitlement system (ex. DJMS and RTS). Exception - Note 3 : Dual access involving CDS and DCPS does not require CAG waiver. Dual access involving CDS and LDTA or ODTA requires CAG waiver.     AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016 Note 4: Any Dual access involving Disbursement System also requires MAJCOM-FOA-DRU FMF/FMP  review and  DO approval. Exception - Note 5: BQ and IAPS(9) do not require CAG waiver.  BQ and DCPS do not require CAG waiver.  DEAMS and BQ and IAPS(9) do not require CAG waiver.     33    A3.3.  Excessive  System  Access:  Besides  multiple  systems  access,  excessive  access  within  a single  system  is  a  concern.    Administrators,  TASO/Sec  Admin,  and  trusted  agents  granting accesses  within  their  systems  will  be  the  first  point  of  control;  however,  it  is  important  to understand the basic restrictions as a good internal control check.  For all other FM systems not listed below, only one access is allowed or an approved CAG waiver (T-1). A3.3.1.  Reserve Travel System (RTS): A3.3.1.1.  Cannot  have  access  to  both  the  Computation  Group  and  the  Administration Group A3.3.1.2.  Cannot have access to both the Audit Group and the Administration Group A3.3.1.3.  Cannot  have  access  to  both  the  Computation  Group  and  the  Disbursement Security Group A3.3.2.  Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) Refer to AFMAN 65-116, V1, Sec 3D: A3.3.2.1.  Cannot  have  both  profiles  JPBXPFL  (release  EFT  payments)  and  JPBBPFL (input  EFT  payments).    Individuals  with  JPBXPFL  must  be  appointed  as  a  certifying officer. A3.3.2.2.  Cannot have profile JPQEPFL (Auditor QE) and any of these other profiles: A3.3.2.2.1.  JPJOPS (Field O/L Processing System) A3.3.2.2.2.  JPPCCPFL (Field Pay/Collections) A3.3.2.2.3.

Cannot have DMO System Administration and have any of these functions: A3.3.3.3.1.  Input A3.3.3.3.2.  Audit A3.3.3.3.3.  Release (DMO Corporate) A3.3.3.4.  Cannot have both Input and Audit unless compensating controls are instituted to  ensure  the  same  user  does  not  input  and  audit  same  cycle  or  a  transaction  within  a cycle   34  AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016 A3.3.4.  Automated  Business  Services  System  (ABSS):    Follow  the  ABSS  Administrator Training  Guide  for  assigning  roles.    Specifically  the  roles  of  Funds  Certifying  Officer, Contracting Officer, DFAS User, and ABSS Administrator must be separated. A3.3.5.  Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF):  A major factor in system access to WAWF is the role of inspector and approver in an inherently governmental position.  Although a receiver may  be  an  authorized  contractor  or  foreign  national,  these  individuals  may  never  be inspectors  or  approvers.    In  addition,  any  items  or  services  they  receive  must  be  further inspected and approved by an authorized government representative. A3.3.6.  Defense  Enterprise  Accounting  and  Management  System  (DEAMS):    Follow Attachment  5, DEAMS System Access and Segregation of Duties (SoD) Guide, for access approval  procedures  and  the  DEAMS  SoD  Matrix  in  the  AFAFO  QA  SharePoint  for authorized accesses.  It is not a conflict for simultaneous access to the applicable base-level DEAMS application and the base-level BQ/IAPS (9).  DEAMS is considered an accounting and entitlement system in relation to other systems. A3.3.7.  Defense  Travel  System  (DTS):    Refer  to  the  USAF  DTS  Business  Rules  and  the Defense  Travel  Management  Office  (DTMO)  Defense  Travel  Administrator  (DTA)  Guide for details on authorized roles, permission levels, and routing lists.  Also refer to applicable MAJCOM  policy  if  more  stringent  controls  are  directed  for  that  MAJCOM.    The  primary importance  is  proper  control,  accountability,  and  separation  of  duties  is  maintained  over DTAs and Approving Officials (AO). A3.4.  Terms  Defined:  CAG  Waiver:    Multiple  system  access  requiring  authorization  by comptroller for FM personnel, DO for disbursing, AFFSC Commander for Center personnel. Compensating controls:  Management controls implemented by an organization to prevent fraud and/or detect fraud.  For example, conducting a post audit of RTS transactions input by a member approved for RTS and BQ accesses is an example of a compensating control.   System Access:  Access to any system utilized by FM.   View only access:  Access to any FM system which allows view only capability without the ability to update or modify transactions or affect system function.  Retrieval only access:  Access to FM systems which allows reports to be generated (i.e., CRIS).  Update Access:  Any access which can change, delete, or add any details of records belonging to that system, or the functioning of the system.    Disbursing system:  ADS/CDS  Entitlement systems:  Military Pay = DJMS and DMO                                   Travel Pay = RTS and FM personnel with DTS DTA rights, and FM DTS certifying/approving officials                                   Civilian Pay = DCPS                                   Vendor Pay = IAPS (9) and DEAMS  AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016   35  Accounting system:  GAFS/BQ and DEAMS  For additional information, contact your Quality Assurance Manager.   36  AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016 REQUEST FOR MULTIPLE ACCESS  Date of Request:  _________________________________   Requester(s):  ____________________________________   ____________________________________  Request ________________________ be provided access to the following systems:       Background necessitating request: 1.  _____________________  2.  _____________________  3.  _____________________  4.  _____________________  Level ______________ Level ______________ Level ______________ Level ______________   Revised compensating controls to ensure effective internal controls are maintained: TASO/Sec Admin Name and Signature  Date: Concur/Nonconcur FSO (CPC Director for AFFSC) Name and Signature (when required)  FMA Name and Signature (when required)   QAM Name and Signature  Comptroller (AFFSC Director for AFFSC) Name & Signature  MAJCOM (if applicable) DO Name and Signature (when required)   Date:   Concur/Nonconcur Date:   Concur/Nonconcur Date:   Concur/Nonconcur Date:   Approved/Disapproved Date:   Approved/Disapproved Date:   Approved/Disapproved AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016   37  Attachment 4 CONTROL MONITORING ACTIVITY PROCEDURES A4.1.  Pay  Record  Accessibility  (PRA)  (T-1).  The  Financial  Services  Officer  (FSO)  is responsible for conducting PRA audits in the areas of military pay, civilian pay, and travel pay, per the following instructions. A4.1.1.  Military Pay PRA.  The FSO will conduct the Military Pay PRA IAW AFMAN 65-116V1, 1.2.1. A4.1.2.  Civilian  Pay  PRA.    The  FSO,  or  deputy  or  a  designee  appointed  in  writing  to conduct  the  PRA  audit,  will  schedule  and  perform  a  semiannual  audit  of  time  and  leave records of civilian employees with  Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS) access,  as well as any  civilian  employee  relatives  identified  in  A4.1.2.1.    The  audit  may  be  conducted  more frequently to relieve workload distribution.  In addition, an audit will be done at the time any personnel  with  DCPS update access depart the organization or  are relieved of their  civilian pay duties. A4.1.2.1.  The  FSO  will  maintain  a  current  list  of  personnel  subject  to  the  audit.    Have personnel  (military  or  civilian)  with  DCPS  update  access  complete  AF  Form  2070, JUMPS Pay Record Accessibility Roster List (separate from Military PRA List), naming all of their relatives (persons connected by blood or marriage, including Common Law) serviced  by  that  Customer  Service  Representative  (CSR),  or  that  there  are  no  such relatives.  A memorandum may be used in lieu of the AF Form 2070, but it must contain the same information.  The records of the civilian employees listed will be subject to the audit.  Personnel must recertify this statement annually. A4.1.2.2.  Conduct the audit by: A4.1.2.2.1.  Obtaining copies of employee’s Master Time History and Master Leave History from DCPS for the period of PRA. A4.1.2.2.2.  Obtaining  copies  of  OPM  Form  71s  (leave)  or  authorized  leave  forms and  any  AF  Form  428s  (overtime)  from  the  applicable  Timekeeper  or  timekeeping system for the period of PRA. A4.1.2.2.3.  Verifying  leave  from  the  OPM  Form  71s  (or  equivalent)  is  properly charged on Master Leave History. A4.1.2.2.4.  Verifying overtime on AF Form 428s is properly listed on Master Time History. A4.1.2.2.5.  Documenting  the  review  and  findings  by  annotating  the  Master  Time History  and  Master  Leave  History  copies  with  the  following  statement,  “PRA performed (date) (name)”. Prepare a statement giving date of PRA audit, name, rank, and position of person performing the audit, and the findings of the audit.  Ensure any discrepancies  are  resolved  and  open  a  Discrepancy  Tracking  Form  for  any discrepancy that cannot resolve immediately.  The FSO and QAM should include the PRA audit as part of the Quality Assurance Plan.   38  AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016 A4.1.3.  Travel  Pay  PRA.    All  travel  vouchers  submitted  for  FM  military  and  civilian personnel  will be PRA audited. Also audited will be travel  vouchers  for on-station military and  civilian  relatives  of  those  FM  personnel  with  input  access  to  Reserve  Travel  System (RTS)  or  who  are  Defense  Travel  Administrators  (DTAs).    Relatives  are  considered  those people connected by blood or marriage, including common law. A4.1.3.1.  For base FM personnel processing vouchers through RTS, the PRA audit must be completed and the document must be signed by the FSO, deputy, or person designated in writing as PRA Auditor, prior to transmission to the AFFSC. Documents are flagged during barcode generation in FM Workflow. Select the radio button for "PRA Audited by FSO". This action will result in assignment of PRA indicator of "FSO".  At a minimum the  FSO  will  validate  the  personal  data,  itinerary,  leave,  per  diem  type,  applicable receipts, and special authorizations on the travel claim. A4.1.3.2.  All  AFFSC  personnel  with  input  access  to  RTS  will  be  flagged  for  PRA. Documents  are  flagged  during  barcode  generation  in  FM  Workflow.  Select  the  radio button for "PRA Audit Required". This action will result in assignment of PRA indicator of  "CPC".    The  PRA  Auditor  will  validate  the  items  listed  in  A4.1.3.1.  and  further compare the travel claim to the RTS Voucher Summary. A4.1.3.3.  For  vouchers  processed  in  DTS,  the  PRA  Auditor  will  conduct  the  PRA  by ensuring they are in the routing list as a Review Official (RO) or Approval Official (AO). A4.1.3.4.  The  PRA  Auditor  will  maintain  a  log  of  vouchers  PRA  audited  and  annotate any findings. A4.2.  QAM  Responsibilities  in  Specific  Areas  of  FM  (T-1).  Periodically  the  QAM  will  be tasked by AFAFO or MAJCOMs to  complete QARs on items  of interest.    Likewise, the QAM must  conduct  on-going  QA  reviews  to  assess  organizational  performance.    These  locally determined  QARs  can  be  based  on  the  QAMs  observation  of  mission  needs;  Comptroller’s discretion;  suggestions  from  FM  staff;  the  section’s  directives,  guides,  and  regulations;  self inspection items; cross-feed items; latest training; FIAR events; etc.  The QAM must look across all FM and use risk management to ensure priority areas are accounted for in these QARs.  The following are standardized requirements and areas of interest in the different sections.  Together with the QAMs independent reviews, they become a vital gauge of the health of FM operations. A4.2.1.  QAM  Responsibilities  in  Financial  Management  Analysis  (FMA).    The  QAM  will review  randomly  selected  lines  from  the  Triannual  Review  to  validate  that  documentation adequately supports the line.  The QAM receives review and reporting instructions from the AFAFO.  The QAM should also look for ways to assist FMA in using predictive models and other  tools  to  conduct  portfolio  analysis  of  programs  such  as  Civilian  Pay,  flying  hours, utilities,  contracts,  etc.  to  determine  accurate  funding  levels  and  ensure  we're  gaining  the most value from every taxpayer dollar we spend. A4.2.2.  QAM  Responsibilities  in  Disbursing.    As  a  key  indicator  to  disbursing  internal controls,  the  QAM  will  conduct  QARs  to  validate  that  cash  verifications  were  properly performed.  The Deputy Disbursing Officer (DDO) is subject to annual staff assistance visits (SAVs) from the Disbursing Officer (DO).  The QAM must assist the DDO by observing the SAV, tracking discrepancies, and helping the DDO prepare for the next SAV. A4.2.3.  QAM Responsibilities in Travel Pay. AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016   39  A4.2.3.1.  The  QAMs  at  AFFSC,  AFRC  bases,  and  ANG  bases  are  directly  responsible for  Improper  Payments  Recovery  and  Elimination  Act  (IPREA)  quarterly  reporting  for RTS payments to the AFAFO.    They receive instructions from AFAFO to accomplish this  reporting.    These  QAMs  are  also  responsible  for  tracking  manual  EFT  changes  in RTS.  IPREA reporting for DTS is accomplished by DFAS. A4.2.3.2.  The QAMs at active duty bases must ensure RTS voucher timeliness standards are  not  circumvented  by  observing  that  proper  FM  Workflow  (WF)  bar  coding,  and FMWF  scanning  procedures  are  being  followed.    The  QAMs  must  also  assist  in validating and minimizing RTS voucher rejects.  In DTS, the QAM will conduct a QAR to validate that the LDTA is correctly accomplishing audit requirements per USAF DTS Business  Rules,  13.5.1.    Because  of  familiarity  with  the  work  required,  the  QAMs  will advise  and  assist  the  LDTAs  in  conducting  compliance  checklists  with  their  ODTAs.  Further,  the  QAMs  will  monthly  report  any  Emergency  Travel  Advance  Payments (ETAP) per instructions from AFAFO. A4.2.4.  QAM Responsibilities in Military Pay. A4.2.4.1.  Pay  Affecting  Documents.    Quarterly,  the  QAM  will  review  45  randomly selected pay affecting documents.  The QAM will ensure the sample includes documents from outside sources (Housing Office, Unit Commanders, etc.) and documents generated locally  (over-the-counter  entitlement  starts,  local  payments,  etc.).    The  QAM  verifies supporting documentation and approving official signatures.  The QAR is provided to the Financial  Services  Officer.    If  a  Financial  Improvements  and  Audit  Readiness  (FIAR) requirement is levied during the quarter, the QAM will use the FIAR tasking to substitute for the applicable number of documents to be reviewed. A4.2.4.2.  DMO/DJMS Management Notices.  Quarterly, the QAM will review a random sample of DJMS/DMO Management Notices to ensure correct follow-up action taken. A4.2.4.3.  Closed  DMO  Cycles.    Quarterly  the  QAM  will  review  a  random  sample  of DMO Closed Cycle Reports to ensure DMO cycles are not input and audited by the same individual.  Reference AFMAN  65-116, V1, 3.25. A4.2.5.  QAM Responsibilities in  Comptroller’s and Commander’s Programs,  Civilian Pay, and  Non-appropriated  Funds  (NAF).    Although  no  standing  SAF/FM  specific  reviews  are directed required in these areas, the QAM must use the suggestions from A4.2. to assess the organizational  performance  just  as  any  other  areas.    Self  inspection  questions  and  the supporting guidance are a good source for possible QARs in these areas.  The QAM should be aware that the NAF Auditor (NAFA) performs similar tasks as QA and would be a good source for advice, knowledge, and mutual support. A4.3.  Records  Disposition  (T-1).

Overall  Applicability.    The  SAG  applies  to  end-user  access  (excludes  IT  system administer accounts) to the DEAMS production system only.  Compliance with this guide is the responsibility of the financial and operational managers within the Air Force and DFAS organizations  accessing  DEAMS.    Senior  management  within  each  organization  is responsible for providing adequate resources and training to ensure that this guide along with proper  segregation  of  duty  principles  are  understood,  established,  enforced,  and institutionalized within the organization. A5.1.2.  User Access Process. A5.1.2.1.  This  is  a  guide  for  comptrollers  and  DFAS  equivalents  to  approve  systems access to DEAMS and to determine the role(s) for the user.  DEAMS roles are groups of responsibilities  needed  to  perform  common  duties  in  base-level  financial  management.  Typically a user will require only one role to perform job functions; however additional roles  or  individual  responsibilities  may  be  required  to  meet  mission  needs.  Information owners  shall  ensure  the  principle  of  least  privileged  access  and  approve  only  required roles or responsibilities. Table A5.1.  Required support for access request.

BPN - The first six (6) digits of the document number (i.e., F3ST744100G001 indicating that the document belongs to 18 AF).  The host installation comptroller determines the appropriate BPN/DoDAAC #. A5.1.2.5.  Users  that  require  Journal  Voucher  (JV)  processing  will  adhere  to  the  DoD threshold dollar amounts and approval levels associated to each of them.  The following responsibilities  must  have  a  journal  voucher  limit  set  in  DEAMS  based  on  the  user’s approving official status as shown below or their appointment letter, if applicable:   DEAMS General Ledger Entry User for DFAS    DEAMS Purchasing Buyer for all other users.  A5.1.2.5.1.  Request for access to one of these responsibilities must include the user’s appointment  letter,  with  associated  threshold  designation,  signed  by  the  level designated in applicable policy and approved DEAMS DD Form 2875.

Review  the  completed  DEAMS  DD  Form  2875  for  accuracy,  appointment letters for Certifiers, appointment letters for JV approval with approved dollar limit, DD Form 577 if applicable, and the DEAMS SoD Waiver if required. A5.1.3.3.  Review  to  determine  if  any  of  the  responsibilities  requested  result  in  a  SoD policy violation. Contact the user if conflicting roles exist per the SoD Matrix, if no SoD Waiver  is  attached.  Advise  and  assist  user  and  management  to  explore  all  alternatives using the principle of least privileged access.  When applicable; require the submission of a completed DEAMS SoD Waiver form; for users that require excessive user access. AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016   43  A5.1.3.4.  Review  the  DEAMS  SoD  Waiver  form(s)  for  completeness,  accuracy,  and required  approvals  when  applicable.    A  detailed  justification  for  the  waiver  must  be provided,  along  with  the  time  duration  for  the  waiver.    The  waiver  must  state  what mitigating controls will be in place, how often they will be performed, and that they will be documented.  Return the form for correction or additional information as required. A5.1.3.5.  Enable  the  user’s  access  to  the  DEAMS  environment  and  assign  requested responsibilities as listed on the DD Form 2875. A5.1.3.6.  Notify the user via email when their access has been enabled. A5.1.3.7.  Maintain  record  of  applicable  DEAMS  SoD  Waiver  form  with  the  DEAMS DD Form 2875. A5.1.4.  Existing Users:  Changing and/or Deleting Responsibilities. A5.1.4.1.

A5.1.4.2.  Termination of User’s Access to DEAMS: A5.1.4.2.1.  The  user’s  immediate  supervisor  or  manager  shall  notify  the  DEAMS Helpdesk two duty days prior to a user’s departure date from the government, onset of terminal leave, or termination of current DEAMS-related duties. A5.1.4.2.2.  The  DEAMS  Helpdesk  shall  disable  the  user’s  access  within  one  duty day.    Note:  The  users  account  is  only  inactive  never  deleted.    Any  future  access request the user will reference their previous account in DEAMS. A5.2.  DEAMS Segregation of Duties (SOD) (T-1). A5.2.1.  Each  DEAMS  user  is  assigned  one  role  made  up  of  several  responsibilities  to complete  installation  level  functions.    Internally,  no  role  contains  conflicting  functions; however,  combinations  of  roles  or  responsibilities  may  enable  conflicting  functions.    If  a person performs more than one role without additional controls, there is a greater potential to carry out and conceal errors or irregularities while performing day-to-day duties.  Use of the least privilege principle when granting access will enforce the separation of duties. A5.2.2.  Responsibilities must be designated and assigned to reduce the likelihood that errors (intentional  and  unintentional)  go  undetected.    Separate  processing  by  different  users  at various stages of a transaction, and independent  reviews of  the work performed will ensure effective SoD.   The DEAMS SoD Matrix in  the AFAFO QA SharePoint lists incompatible responsibilities within DEAMS. insufficient to  segregate  duties  must  have A5.2.3.  Organizations  with compensating controls, such as supervisory review of transactions performed.  As such, users requesting  DEAMS  responsibilities  that  have  conflicts,  as  defined  in  the  DEAMS  SoD Matrix, shall complete a DEAMS SoD Waiver form justifying the requested access as well as documenting the compensating controls to mitigate any risks. resources   44  AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016 A5.2.3.1.  The DEAMS SoD Waiver form requires the following approval: FMO – DEAMS FMO Director   DFAS personnel - DFAS Center Director or designee   AF Base Level Personnel – Host Installation Comptroller   DEAMS Operations and Support personnel:    Helpdesk/Sustainment Personnel – AFFSO Director   Officer must approve.   PMO – DEAMS PMO Director If the waiver involves multiple systems access with the disbursing system, the Disbursing A5.2.3.2.  Segregation of Duties waivers are intended to be granted on a temporary basis.  All approved waiver forms, regardless of the user’s organization, will be initially granted for up to one year.  If the user continues to require the waiver past one year, the user will submit an updated SoD waiver. A5.2.3.3.  The  TASO/Sec  Admin  and  QAM  at  each  base  shall  monitor  DEAMS  SoD waivers  to  satisfy  audit  requirements  in  accordance  with  A3.1.2  and  A5.3.    The  QAM will ensure any multiple system access waiver requirements are met; an example would be combining access to  DEAMS and the disbursing system. Reference the Revised AFI 65-202, Attachment 3 for multiple systems access. A5.2.4.  The  DEAMS  Helpdesk/  Sustainment  personnel  shall  be  responsible  for  ensuring DEAMS DD Form 2875 (Figure A5.1) and applicable DEAMS SoD Waiver form, and when required,  appointment  letter/DD  Form  577,  are  complete  and  approved  before  granting DEAMS  access.    The  AFAFO  and  the  DEAMS  FMO  Compliance  Team  shall  be  jointly responsible for maintaining the DEAMS SoD Guide including the DEAMS SoD Matrix and monitoring the exceptions. A5.2.5.  The  DEAMS  AFFSO  Sustainment  Team  will  manage  requests  to  add,  change,  or delete  DEAMS  Responsibilities  utilizing  proper  naming  convention  standards.    Change requests will also be coordinated with the DEAMS FMO Compliance Team and the AFAFO. A5.2.6.  The  DEAMS  FMO  Compliance  Team  will  define  functional  groups  of  users  like roles  for  ease  of  security  administration  and  to  facilitate  separation  of  duties  at  different levels.  They will be responsible for reviewing the user access authorizations report monthly for  incompatible  functions  not  supported  by  a  SoD  waiver.    The  Compliance  Team  will forward  the  report  to  the  host-installation  Comptrollers,  MAJCOM  QAMs,  and  DFAS representatives to alert them of any user conflicts not supported by a waiver.  Conflicting role will be terminated when identified and reestablished when waiver is received. A5.2.7.  The  DEAMS  FMO  Compliance  Team  shall  validate  the  Comptroller’s  annual review of SoD waivers per A5.3.5.1. A5.3.  Control Monitoring Requirements. A5.3.1.  The  TASO/Sec  Admin,  QAM,  Host  Installation  Comptroller,  DEAMS  FMO Compliance Team, and DFAS equivalents will fulfill internal control monitoring activities as indicated below (T-1). A5.3.2.  TASO/Sec Admin responsibilities.  This fulfills the CAG requirements of A3.1.2.1.1 for DEAMS. AFI65-202  25 JANUARY 2016   45  A5.3.2.1.  Quarterly,  the  TASO/Sec  Admin  use  the  DEAMS  Compliance  User  List Report,  or  equivalent,  to  review  users’  responsibilities  against  their  DEAMS  DD  Form 2875.    Specifically,  the  TASO/Sec  Admin  will  review  system  access  and  JV  approval threshold  level  for  all  personnel  to  ensure  those  with  DEAMS  access  are  properly documented,  justified,  and  approved.    This  review  will  include  contacting  the  user’s supervisor  to  determine  if  conflicting  accesses  on  SoD  waivers  are  still  required,  and ensuring user  accounts for departing (reassignment,  separation, or  retirement) personnel are purged.  The TASO/Sec Admin will document this review. A5.3.2.2.  Quarterly, the TASO/Sec Admin will use the Compliance User Responsibility Login  Report  or  equivalent  to  review  the  last  login  by  responsibility.    If  an  installation level  user  has  not  logged  in  to  a  responsibility  for  more  than  90  days,  access  to  the responsibility should be reviewed and removed if not needed. DEAMS Help Desk  will provide  the  4th  quarter  Responsibility  Login  Report  to  the  host  base  comptroller  for assessment, refer to A5.3.4.1 below. A5.3.3.  QAM responsibilities. A5.3.3.1.  Using the CAG guidelines in A3.1.2.2.,  the  QAM will conduct a semi-annual QA review (QAR) to validate the TASO/ Sec Admin is adequately reconciling DEAMS system  accesses.    The  QAM  will  validate  all  of  the  items  indicated  in  A5.3.2.1.    The QAM will provide the QAR to the Comptroller. A5.3.3.2.  At least quarterly, the QAM will review each monetary override to ensure the override  was  appropriate  and  fully  documented.    The  QAM  will  conduct  a  QAR  by comparing  the  Compliance  Override  Report  (4  parts)  in  DEAMS  to  the  control  log, maintained  by  FMA  or  DFAS  equivalent,  to  verify  all  overrides  were  captured.    The QAM will validate that the override was necessary, properly  supported, and the control log  was  properly  maintained.    Report  the  results  of  the  review  with  any  findings  and recommendations to the Comptroller.  Reference the current “DEAMS Air Force Funds Override Policy” located at the AFAFO Accounting SharePoint. A5.3.4.  Host Installation Comptroller responsibilities. A5.3.4.1.  Annually, the Comptroller will assess the health of the unit’s DEAMS system access/SoD  internal  controls  by  either  endorsing  the  latest  QAR  or  on  a  separate memorandum.    The assessment will be provided to the DEAMS Help Desk by 30 Oct each year. A5.3.4.2.  As  part  of  the  assessment  required  in  A5.3.4.1,  the  Comptroller  must acknowledge the continued need for any existing DEAMS SoD waivers. A5.3.5.  DEAMS FMO Compliance Team responsibilities. A5.3.5.1.  Annually,  The  DEAMS  FMO  Compliance  Team  will  validate the Comptroller’s assessment and/or conduct an independent annual review of DEAMS SoD waivers. A5.4.
