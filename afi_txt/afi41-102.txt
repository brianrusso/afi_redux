Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS). 1.1.1.  MEPRS  is  a  managerial  cost  system  that  accumulates  and  reports  expenses, manpower,  and  workload  performed  in  DoD  fixed  military  medical  and  dental  treatment facilities.    It  is  the  basis  for  establishing  a  uniformed  reporting  methodology  that  provides consistent  financial  and  operating  performance  data  to  support  senior  leaders  who  are responsible for allocating the programmatic resources used to sustain the health care delivery system.    The  MEPRS  information  assists  in  measuring  productivity  and  management effectiveness,  developing  performance  standards  and  process  improvement  initiatives  to enhance business planning opportunities and resource allocation. 1.1.2.  Since  the  data  derived  from  MEPRS  may  be  incorporated  into  business  planning analysis  and  used  by  the  Air  Force  Medical  Service  (AFMS)  and  DoD  in  making  strategic programmatic decisions, the data must be accurate, timely and reliable.  Data integrity issues can affect the outcome of studies, analyses, and metrics, resulting in erroneous assumptions and leading to faulty decisions made concerning the efficiency and effectiveness of medical facilities and provider productivity. 1.1.3.  MEPRS identifies the cost of care provided in MTFs by product line and beneficiary category.    MEPRS  connects  the  expenses  incurred  with  the  Full  Time  Equivalents  (FTEs) reported  and  workload  generated  in  each  MTF  by  Functional  Cost  Code  (FCC),  formerly MEPRS codes, it is used as a historical representation of the MTF for comparative analysis performed at higher Headquarters and Defense Health Agency (DHA). 6 AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Work Center Definition. 5.2.1.  A  work  center  is  a  discrete  functional  or  organizational  subdivision  within  an  MTF authorized  to  accumulate  and  measure  expense,  workload,  manpower  utilization  and performance. 5.2.1.1.  The  following  criteria  listed  below  needs  to  be  met  before  establishing  a  work center and assigning an FCC.  It should: 5.2.1.2.  Have compatibility with the Unit Manning Document (UMD) or other allocated manpower (e.g. contractors). 5.2.1.3.  Have identifiable expenses (Supplies/Equipment/Contracts/Salaries). 5.2.1.4.  Have allocated physical space. 5.2.1.5.  Have  valid  production  (count/code)  as  defined  by  DoD  6010.13-M  or  an  AF special interest program (Attachment 2). 5.2.1.6.  Have a uniqueness of service provided or expenses incurred when compared to other established work centers. 5.2.1.7.  Have Executive Leadership coordination. 5.2.1.7.1.  Coordinate with AFMOA MEPRS if you need any clarification. Note:  FCCs not listed on the AF Master ASD or Program Element Mapping (PEMAP) will not be entered into CHCS/AHLTA or other systems without approval.  5.3.  Establishing Functional Cost Codes (FCCs). 5.3.1.  For a new work center is made in coordination with basic coding guidance.  FCCs and related data, as defined by the ASD form the basis for cost allocation. 5.3.2.  First determine if the new work center meets the above requirements as stated in para 5.2. 5.3.3.  MTFs must receive approval from AFMOA MEPRS before new FCCs are used.  (T-0) 5.4.  Account Subset Definition (ASD). 5.4.1.  Identifies  the  FCCs  used  by  an  MTF,  the  activation  date,  deactivation  date,  if applicable, and the Responsibility Center/Cost Center (RC/CC).  It specifies the Assignment Sequence Number (ASN), which is used in the allocation/purification process.  It also defines the  Data  Sets  used  in  the  allocation  and  purification  process  (refer  to  Table  8.1  and  8.2  in this instruction for more information on Data Set usage).  AFMOA MEPRS will validate all facilities’ ASD annually.  (T-0) 5.4.2.  The ASNs are published on the Master MEPRS Table that is released annually by the Air Force MEPRS Program Manager. 16 AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 5.4.3.  During budget preparation for the new FY, the MTF RA, manpower manager, MPM, and logistics office coordinates work center RC/CCs and FCCs or Functional Account Codes (FACs).  The addition or deletion of work centers or FCCs are coordinated with each affected program to ensure proper allocation of data.  This occurs following the close out of the third quarter. 5.4.4.  Following  in-house  coordination,  the  MTF  must  submit  the  coordinated  ASD  to AFMOA MEPRS for review and approval.  (T-0) Note:  Brief all changes during DQ, Executive Committee and CCM meetings to ensure widest possible dissemination.  5.4.4.1.  Coordinate with systems administrators to ensure the accuracy of tables located in  CHCS,  AHLTA  and  Defense  Medical  Logistics  Standard  Support  (DMLSS)  or  any other system(s) that interface with or provide data to EASIVi.  (T-0) 5.4.5.  DoD  6010.13-M  is  the  master  document  used  to  ensure  FCCs  reflects  the  correct workload  capture  and  expense  assignment.    RC/CCs  and  FACs  are  matched  to  FCCs  as outlined  in  the  PEMAP  spreadsheet.    All  FCCs  and  RC/CCs  used  by  the  RA,  Manpower Manager,  and  Logistics  Office  should  reflect  the  same  information.    The  PEMAP  is published annually by AFMSA/SG1/8YB, who validates appropriate FCC, RC/CC Program Element Code (PEC) FAC usage.  There may be multiple RC/CCs assigned to the same FCC, so that a more accurate tracking of financial information may be performed. Note:  The PEMAP is frequently updated throughout the year so always ensure you are working with the most current version.  Refer to Knowledge Exchange-MEPRS Documents page for the most current version. 5.5.  Cost Pool "X" Codes. 5.5.1.  Cost  Pool  “X”  codes  are  used  in  situations  where  time  and  expenses  are  difficult  to assign directly and are used by more than one FCC because the work centers share physical space,  personnel,  and/or  supply  items.    Cost  pools  can  be  set  up  for  any  clinical  function.  Care should be taken to ensure that all members of the cost pool benefit from all elements of the cost pool.   For example, establish a cost pool when multiple Family Health Clinic teams share supplies/personnel and it is difficult to determine each clinic’s use.  Identify cost pools with an "X" in the third position of the FCC.  Example-The code for Family Practice Teams B  (BGAB)  and  H  (BGAH)  cost  pool  would  be  "BGXA".    Assign  all  shared  personnel  and expenses  (i.e.  supply  costs,  square  footage,  linen,  etc.)  to  the  cost  pool  code.    Those accumulated  costs  are  then  distributed  from  the  cost  pool  to  the  specialties  within  the  cost pool based on workload for each specialty during the purification process. Note:  Only shared administrative staff should report time to a cost pool; clinical support should charge directly to the different teams as they are performing work in the specific clinical areas.    Note:  Clinicians are never assigned to, or able to charge time against cost pool codes.   5.5.2.  Items  purchased  for  a  specific  work  center  should  be  directly  expensed  to  that  work center.  Any personnel  salary, supply expense, contract  cost  or manning  assist  expense that can be readily identified to the pure code (example - BGAB or BGAH) should be reported to the specific work center. Cost pools can be used for any clinical area. AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 17 5.6.  Unique Air Force Account Codes: 5.6.1.  Attachment 2 contains unique Air Force account codes. 5.6.2.  Air Force MTFs will not use the following FCCs listed in DoD 6010.13-M:  (T-0) Table 5.4. MEPRS Codes not used in AF Reporting. AAD-Dermatology AAI-Nephrology AAO-Clinical Immunology AAG-Hematology AAN-Physical Medicine ABH-Pediatric Surgery AAE-Endocrinology AAM-Rheumatology AAQ-Bone Marrow Transplant BAR-Physical Medicine BAH-Hematology BBJ-Pediatric Surgery BBH-Proctology BHB-Physical Exams BHA-Primary Care BKA-Undersea Medicine DDA-Electrocardiography DDC-Electroneuromyography  DDD-Pulmonary Functions EDI-Police Protection FAA-Area Reference Labs  FBD-Radiation Health FEC-Transient Patient Care GEC-Contingency Blocks  EDK-Other Base Support FAC-Ophthalmic Fabrication FDB-Base Operations GEA-Prepositioned War  AEC-Hand Surgery BAT-Bone Marrow   BEC-Hand Surgery BHH-Tricare Support DDB-Electroencephalogy EDH-Fire Protection EIC-Inpt Clinical Nutrition  FBC-Industrial Hygene FDD-Decedent Affairs  GEB-Contingency Care   5.6.3.  These codes are aligned with other product lines if this work is being performed in AF facilities, refer to AFMOA MEPRS for specific guidance. 5.6.4.  Third  level  "Z"  Not  Elsewhere  Classified  codes  may  only  be  used  with  a  DHA approved waiver. 18 AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 Chapter 6 TABLE MAINTENANCE 6.1.  Tables. 6.1.1.  Used  within  the  EASIVi  system  ensure  personnel,  financial  and  workload  data  are properly identified and aligned for correct cost allocation.  All EASIVi and associated system tables are reviewed and updated at least annually. 6.2.  AFMSA/SG1/8YB. 6.2.1.  Reviews and updates the master tables at least annually but also as needed throughout the year.  (T-0) 6.3.  MTFs. 6.3.1.  Will keep the tables in EASIVi updated to reflect current year activities.  (T-0) 6.3.2.  MTFs must ensure ASD Table changes are made prior to each fiscal  year, and when appropriate throughout the year, following AFMOA MEPRS approval.  (T-0) 6.3.3.  The  MPM  approves  all  FCCs  (with  AFMOA  MEPRS  approval)  in  use  at  the  MTF.  (T-0) 6.3.4.  No  FCCs  are  used  in  CHCS/AHLTA,  DMHRSi,  EASIVi  or  any  other  approved Military Health System (MHS) data system, without AFMOA MEPRS approval.  The CHCS Administrator, in  coordination with  the MPM, will  ensure only approved FCCs are used in the CHCS Files/Tables.  (T-0) 6.3.5.  The  DQ  Assurance  Team  provides  oversight  and  ensures  approved  FCCs  are  being appropriately used in the CHCS File/Table structure.  Non-approved FCCs are identified and appropriate corrective actions are coordinated by the DQ Assurance Team. 6.3.6.  The  DQ  Assurance  Team  will  ensure  the  EASIVi  ASD  Table  is  reconciled  with DMHRSi  and  the  CHCS  Site  Definable  MEPRS  Table  prior  to  the  annual  FY  update,  and where necessary throughout the year.  (T-0) 6.3.7.  The  CHCS  Administrator  and  MPM  will  complete  an  annual  review  of  users  who have access to add, edit or delete FCCs in CHCS.  (T-0) Note:  The CHCS/AHLTA files are built for ease of use, not for acceptance into EASIVi.   The source system for correct FCCs is the EASIVi system.  The same FCCs are reflected in CHCS/AHLTA as EASIVi the Physicians’ Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Diagnostic Related Groups (DRG) files are synchronized to avoid errors when processing the CAPER and Standard Inpatient Data Record (SIDR).  Ensure the most current software versions are used. AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 19 Chapter 7 PERSONNEL UTILIZATION AND SALARY EXPENSE DATA 7.1.  Time and Salary Reporting. 7.1.1.  Timely  and  accurate  control  of  personnel  data  is  essential  for  the  total  success  of MEPRS;  personnel  salary  represents  60-75%  of  the  total  cost  of  care.  DMHRSi  is  the required system to capture this information and provide it to MEPRS. Note:  It is crucial that the supervisors be involved with DMHRSi template development and the time/labor reporting process.  In support of that requirement, the individual listed as the "Supervisor" in an individual's HR record in DMHRSi receives an "FYI" notification via DMHRSi work list of the timecard their subordinate submitted each pay period. 7.1.2.  Personnel data generally includes both salary and FTEs.  MEPRS defines 168 hours as 1 (one) FTE.  Please refer to para. 2.10. for the responsibilities of the work center MEPRS POCs. 7.1.3.  There are a wide variety of helpful time reporting tools you should refer to for more detailed  time  reporting  requirements,  such  as  the  MEPRS  Quick  Reference  Time  Matrix, DMHRSi EoM Manual, and DoD 6010.13-M Appendix 3.  (T-0) 7.1.4.  All  personnel  working  at  the  MTF  during  the  timecard  pay  period  will  accurately report  their  hours  in  DMHRSi  NLT  COB  the  first  duty  day  after  timecard  period  ends (Monday).    (T-0)    Actual  hours  should  be  reported,  for  work  performed  inside  and  outside the MTF in support of the mission.  There is no hour reporting constraint (168 a month or 80 hours  per  pay  period).    The  only  exception  would  be  Civil  Service  personnel  refer  to  para. 7.2.1.2. or refer to the DMHRSi EOM Processing Guidelines for more definitive instruction.  (T-0) Note:  AFMOA MEPRS will extract DMHRSi submitted compliance on the third calendar day (Tuesday) after each pay period ends, and extract DMHRSi approved compliance on the eleventh calendar day (second Wednesday) after each pay period ends. 7.2.  All Personnel must have their timecards in “SUBMITTED” status. 7.2.1.  NLT  COB  the  first  duty  day  after  timecard  period  ends  (Monday),  if  the  employee will be unavailable on this day the data must be input prior to their departure (TDY, leave, detail etc.).  (T-0) Timecard Approvers in conjunction with the MPM must approve or reject timecards NLT COB the third duty day after timecard period ends (Wednesday).  (T-0) All rejected  timecards  are  corrected,  re-submitted  and  approved  NLT  COB  the  fifth  duty  day after  the  timecard  period  ends  (Friday).    (T-0)  Upon  rejection  of  a  timecard,  Timecard Approvers must immediately notify the individual that their timecard was rejected along with the reason for the rejection.  (T-0) All Timecards must be in 100% “APPROVED” status by COB seventh duty day after the close of the timecard period (second Tuesday).  (T-0) This is in  support  of  DQMCP  Questions  3c-DMHRSi  Timecards  Submitted  &  3d-DMHRSi Timecards Approved, which has been updated to evaluate each pay period separately. 7.2.1.1.  Actual  Hours  in  support  of  the  mission  should  be  reported  in  the  appropriate FCCs,  and  should  total  to  at  least  the  appropriate  number  of  duty  hours  for  that  pay 20 AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 period.  Hours  are used  to  distribute salary across the functional  areas of the MTF,  and are  crucial  in  accurately  reporting  the  cost  of  services  provided  within  the  MTF.    The following personnel are required to submit timecards: 7.2.1.2.  United  States  active  duty  military  personnel  assigned  and  borrowed  (e.g. manning assistance) to the facility. 7.2.1.3.  Federal civilian employee assigned or borrowed to the  facility.  Hours reported by  civil  service  personnel  are  reconciled  with  the  DCPS  pay  file  and  must  match  time reported on their DCPS time card. Note:  The one exception would be providers under the Provider/Dental Pay Plan; only their Non-Available time is reconciled, as they may have requirements to work more than the normal 80 hours per pay period. 7.2.1.4.  Foreign  national  employees  (direct  and  indirect  hire)  paid  from  appropriated funds. Note:  Indirect hires are foreign national personnel working within our facilities who are in-place as a result of an agreement between the U.S. and a foreign government.  7.2.1.5.  Military medical program students (e.g. phase II, interns, residents, etc.) working in or assigned to the facility to complete training requirements. 7.2.1.6.  Contractors working in the facility.  Contractors will submit only available hours (FTEs).    (T-0)  Salary  expenses  (Financial  Compensation)  is  reflected  in  the  financial system. 7.2.1.6.1.  If  the  contract  doesn’t  require  personnel  to  report  the  number  of  work hours,  the  work  center  POC  will  refer  to  the  Functional  Requirements  Evaluator Designees  (FREDs)  to  determine  the  hours  worked  based  on  the  statement  of  work and submit the available contract hours.  (T-0) 7.2.1.6.2.  Do  not  include  day  workers  in  the  facility  that  is  covered  by  a  service contract (e.g. Copier Repair, or base Civil Engineer personnel).  These personnel are considered part of the services paid by the contract. 7.2.1.7.  Reserve,  Air  National  Guard  and  Individual  Mobilization  Augmentee  (IMA) personnel assigned to serve their tour at the facility. Personnel will report in accordance to current DMHRSi business rules.  (T-0) 7.2.1.8.  Patient  Squadron  Personnel:  Active  duty  members  assigned  to  the  patient squadron may help within the facility and their time is captured as borrowed personnel.  Members of the Patient Squadron will use their appropriate Grade/Rank but are assigned occupation codes that define the work that they are supporting. (T-0) 7.2.1.9.  Borrowed Personnel:  Personnel borrowed from outside the  facility (not on the MTF UMD) will report their time and salary to the work centers they are supporting.  An example of borrowed personnel  would be the Squadron Medical  Elements  (SMEs) who are assigned to a flying squadron but provide services within the MTF.  Track available time to the benefiting work centers for borrowed personnel, and report the remainder of their time to  FCGC  – Squadron Medical  Element  (SME) Non-MTF Activity.  The total AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 21 time  they  report  should  represent  the  total  amount  of  time  they  worked  during  the reporting month. 7.2.1.9.1.  Time  for  the  entire  pay  period  needs  to  be  accounted  for  so  that  salary distribution to clinical services is accurate. 7.2.1.9.2.  Borrowed  personnel  will  report  time,  until  they  are  no  longer  performing recurring duties in the facility.  (T-0) 7.2.1.9.3.  If borrowed personnel (SMEs) are deployed from their unit, do not report any deployment time for them. 7.2.1.10.  Volunteers  only  report  available  hours  as  there  is  no  salary  compensation; included  as  volunteers  are  students  (externs)  under  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding (MOU) with local colleges or facility programs such as Red Cross, Dental Assistants or Pharmacy students, etc. 7.2.1.11.  All  Non-DHP  Employees  working  in  Non-DHP  programs  such  as  Family Advocacy (FASF) or Exceptional Family Member Program (FAZN) or Domestic Abuse Victim Advocate (DAVA) (FASF) will report their time to the appropriate Code. (T-0) 7.3.  Collect time until the member is no longer assigned. 7.3.1.  (military  and  civilian)  or  working  (borrowed,  contract  and  volunteers,  etc.)  in  the MTF. 7.3.1.1.  When  personnel  process  out  for  a  Permanent  Change  of  Station  (PCS), retirement,  or  separation,  report  their  time  following  their  departure  from  the  facility  to the  Report  No  Later  Than  Date  (RNLTD),  final  duty  day  or  separation  date  to  FDGA-PCS/ETS Related Functions. 7.3.2.  The time spent attending out-processing appointments is charged to FDGA-PCS/ETS Related Functions. 7.3.3.  For  personnel,  who  are  Absent  without  Leave  (AWOL),  continue  to  collect  time  for only the first 30 days.  If the individual(s) are gone for longer than 30 days, depart them from the facility. 7.3.4.  Personnel  attending  school,  report  only  the  class  time  under  FALA-Continuing Education (CE).  Travel time is charged to FDGA-PCS/ETS Related Functions. 7.3.5.  Personnel  attending  Professional  Military  Education  (PME)  are  captured  in  GBAA-Readiness Training.  Travel time is charged to FDGA-PCS/ETS Related Functions. 7.3.6.  When personnel are working outside of the MTF the entire month (deployed or TDY) or on leave, it is not appropriate to report more than the total number of regularly scheduled duty hours in the reporting month.  Keep in mind; we are trying to appropriately allocate the salary to the work produced. 7.3.7.  Time  is  not  captured  or  reported  for  civilian  employees  paid  from  non-appropriated funds or direct and indirect hire foreign national employees in an unpaid absence status. 7.3.8.  Civilians  on  leave  without  pay  report  their  time  in  DMHRSi  under  task  code  02.04.  The timecard will reject in DMHRSi, during reconciliation, if hours are not entered to match the civilian pay timecard. 22 AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 7.4.  The MPM will be responsible for importing the DMHRSi DoD EASIVi Create File. 7.4.1.  Into EASIVi.  (T-0) Refer to the DMHRSi EoM for step by step instructions. 7.5.  The three types of FTE data are assigned, Available, and Non-available. 7.5.1.  DoD  6010.13-M,  Chapter  3,  defines  the  use  of  available  and  non-available  time.  Refer to Appendix 3 for a list of standard reporting scenarios. 7.5.1.1.  Available  FTEs  are  based  on  hours  worked.    Available  FTEs  are  calculated  by dividing available hours in a given work center by 168 (1 FTE equals 168 hours).  Actual hours  should  be  reported  to  support  all  mission  operations.    Civilians  are  the  only personnel category that has a capped hour requirement, the time reported on their civilian timecard. 7.5.2.  Military personnel report all hours spent in support of mission requirements, including work performed at home.  Civilian personnel report approved overtime/compensatory time. 7.5.3.  Assigned  FTEs  are  based  on  the  actual  number  of  days  during  each  month  an individual  is  assigned  to  the  MTF.    Assigned  FTEs  are  not  based  on  hours;  rather  it  is  the percentage of time actually assigned to a work center any given month. 7.5.4.  Non-available  FTEs appointments), and military other (AD only). include leave,  sick (quarters/hospital  admission/medical 7.5.4.1.  Leave is charged in accordance with normal duty hours (schedule).  If personnel work a 12-hour schedule you would charge leave in 12-hour increments, but not charge leave on their normal off days. 7.6.  Military Salaries. 7.6.1.  Are  standardized  rates  based  on  composites  of  all  pay,  allowances,  and  entitlements updated  annually  (IAW  AFI  65-503,  U.S.  Air  Force  Cost  and  Planning  Factors).  Grade/Salary  tables  for  military  are  provided  to  DMHRSi  annually  from  the  Air  Force MEPRS Program Manager as soon as they are available. 7.7.  Civilian Salaries. 7.7.1.  Are  provided  to  DMHRSi  by  an  interface  with  DCPS.    Local  personnel  use  the Automated Time Attendance and Production System (ATAAPS) to actually report their work hours for pay purposes. 7.8.  Available FTEs. 7.8.1.  Are  applied  against  the  Grade/Salary  Table  to  calculate  personnel  costs.    Salary expense for non-available time is charged to the assigned work center. 7.9.  The Grade/Salary Table. 7.9.1.  Reflects the monthly cost per FTE and is the maximum amount that is distributed.  For example, if monthly salary is $2,500.00 and the hours reported are 160 available and 32 non-available,  then  the  total  FTEs  would  be  1.14.    The  amount  distributed  would  still  be $2,500.00. 7.10.  Method of Data Collection. 7.10.1.  DMHRSi is the directed methodology of personnel time capture. AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 23 7.10.2.  The  MHS,  in  fulfilling  a  Deputy  Secretary  of  Defense  mandate  to  simplify  and centralize  medical  personnel  asset  visibility,  has  chosen  DMHRSi,  a  Commercial-Off-The-Shelf  (COTS)  integrated  Human  Resource  Management  System.    DMHRSi  is  intended  to provide the MHS with an Automated Information System (AIS) that integrates HR data from multiple information sources and allows real-time access to essential manpower, HR, Labor Cost  Assignment  (LCA),  Education  and  Training  (E&T),  and  readiness  information  across the MHS. 7.10.3.  The  Deputy  Surgeon  General  (DSG)  has  mandated  the  use  of  the  LCA,  HR,  and Manpower  modules.    The  single  most  important  factor  for  the  Air  Force  is  that  DMHRSi serves as a source system for manpower, human resources and readiness.  The primary need for DMHRSi within the AFMS is to support functional processes for LCA, the critical labor source  feed  for  the  MEPRS  system,  and  the  need  for  visibility  of  management  data  on  all personnel working for the AFMS and subsequently the entire DoD. 7.10.4.  The HR asset for the MTFs consists of the following personnel  types:   active duty, guard, reserve, civilian or government service, contractor, local national and volunteer.  HR assets can either be assigned to an MTF or borrowed from another military facility in order to fulfill specific functions within the MTF. 7.10.5.  Personnel data for active duty, guard, and reserve personnel is fed from the Military Personnel Data System (MILPDS) and data for government civilian service personnel is fed from the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS).  Personnel data for contractors, local  nationals  and  volunteers  are  manually  entered.    HR  personnel  at  each  MTF  will  be responsible for the management of DMHRSi HR records for all person types throughout the employment life cycle, as outline in the DMHRSi Concept of Operations (CONOPS).  (T-0) A list of the HR roles and responsibilities are listed in DMHRSi CONOPS Usage Policies. 7.10.6.  The responsibility of HR personnel at each site is to effectively manage and update the  DMHRSi  HR  records  so  that  Senior  Leadership  has  full  visibility  of  all  person-types working  in  a  particular  site  and  also  visibility  of  all  person-types  enterprise  wide.    It  is critical the site HR personnel perform record maintenance tasks and maintain the 18 essential data elements, as outlined in the DMHRSi CONOPS and the DMHRSi End of Month (EoM) Guide. 7.10.7.  The LCA, HR, and Manpower integrated management of DMHRSi is critical.  Each MTF will form a Functional Integrated Working Group (FIWG) consisting of primary points of contact for each module to provide oversight to the DMHRSi processes, ensure it is used to  its  fullest  potential,  foster  communication  between  functional  areas,  and  recommend process changes to the MTF/CC. (T-0) 24 AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 Chapter 8 DATA SETS (WORKLOAD) 8.1.  The Data Set (Workload). 8.1.1.  This  section  describes  the  workload  data  requirements  of  MEPRS  and  includes  an explanation  of  the  applicability  of  existing  Air  Force  data  collection  procedures  to  the MEPRS data requirements. 8.2.  Workload. 8.2.1.  Is  captured  in  a  data  set  that  is  used  for  allocation  to  quantify  the  amount  of  work accomplished by a work center.  DoD 6010.13-M defines specific allocation factors for the various workload data.  Air Force guidance and procedures further define specific workload reporting requirements.  Workload is associated with both patient care and non-patient care activities.    Coordination  with  work  center  personnel,  Data  Quality  Assurance  Team,  the CHCS/AHLTA  database  administrator(s),  and  the  MPM  is  crucial  in  establishing  local workload  validation  procedures.    The  GPM  must  be  an  integral  part  of  all  workload-capturing clinical processes.  (T-0) 8.2.2.  All workload factors are covered in this document.  Not all work centers documented on the master ASD File are used by all facilities.  The UMD is the starting point to determine which  codes  should  be  reported  in  the  system.    For  further  guidance  contact  AFMOA MEPRS. 8.2.3.  Coordinate with appropriate work center personnel to determine the most efficient and effective  means  of  acquiring  the  manually  collected  workload  data.    Implement  additional procedures required by MEPRS reporting requirements as necessary. 8.2.4.  If a work center closes, contact AFMOA MEPRS for appropriate actions. 8.3.  Data Sets. 8.3.1.  Identify  and  collect  different  types  of  workload  factors,  expenses,  FTEs,  weighted factors,  and  other  information  such  as  square  footage,  in  a  prescribed  format.    Data  Sets summarize  workload  data  by  FCC  and  show  which  work  centers  benefit  from  a  specific service. 8.3.2.  Table  8.1  is  the  automated  and  manually  generated  Data  Set  Standard  Table  and reflects  how data is  input  into EASIVi.  S indicates system-generated data and M indicates data that is manually tracked and input to EASIVi.  For system-generated data, the Workload Assignment Module (WAM) is used.  Automated workload captured in CHCS is transmitted via the WAM for use in the EASIVi System.  The CHCS data is summarized for entry into EASIVi  using  generated  reports  in  WAM,  and  is  validated  prior  to  being  transmitted  to EASIVi.   AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 25 Table 8.1.

The  MPM  in  cooperation  with  appropriate  MEPRS  work  center  POCs  and  work center managers will establish a process to conduct workload validation, including assigning responsibility  for  validating  data  accuracy,  data  correction,  and  accurate  reporting.  Significant workload inconsistencies are corrected at the data source by the work center and EASIVi is updated accordingly.  Contact AFMOA MEPRS for guidance.  (T-0) 8.6.  Work Center Specific Workload Validation: 8.6.1.  Workload reconciliation is a monthly requirement to be performed by the MPM.  To reconcile,  compare  the  Monthly  Statistical  Report  (MSR)  and  the  WAM  reports.    EASIVi workload should be the same as the data reflected in the WWR.  Both data sets represent data as  of  the  point  in  time  when  the  reports  are  generated  and  therefore  may  be  different. Identified anomalies are reported to the DQM and GPMs. 28 AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 Note:  If End of Day Processing has not been accomplished, the End-of-Day Delinquency Report prints instead of the Monthly Statistical Report.  The Biometric Data Quality Assurance Service (BDQAS) WWR suspense for inpatient facilities only is no later than the 5th duty day after the month has ended, and WAM is usually generated later in the month.  8.6.2.  Inpatient  Workload  (A  Accounts).    Ensure  proper  FCCs  are  identified  in  CHCS Reports  to  identify  the  type  of  care  the  patient  is  receiving  based  on  the  specialty  of  the primary  provider  of  care.    (T-0)  Ensure  inpatient  ancillary  requests  contain  the  appropriate requesting inpatient FCC that is used during the inpatient stay while prescriptions issued at the  time  of  discharge  is  properly  assigned  to  the  appropriate  outpatient  work  center.    (T-0) Ensure workload has corresponding FTEs and expenses.  (T-0) Performance Factors:  Admissions (ADM), Occupied Bed Days (OBD), Dispositions (Disp) Relative Weighted Products (RWPs), and Relative Case Mix Index (RCMI)    8.6.3.  Outpatient Workload (B Accounts).  Capture the workload where the care is provided (example:  Provider assigned to  Internal  Medicine and sees a patient  in  Family Practice, the visit falls under the Family Practice FCC).  (T-0) If the provider sees a patient in other than their  normally  assigned  clinic,  both  workload  (encounter),  ancillary  services  (Lab,  Rad, Pharmacy  etc,)  and  time  (DMHRSi)  are  reported  in  the  clinic  where  resources  were consumed.    Refer  to  the  AFMS  Workload  Guidelines  for  specific  workload  reporting guidance.  All workload should have corresponding FTEs and expenses.   Performance Factors:  Total Visits, Outpatient Visits and Relative Value Units (RVUs).  8.6.4.  Dental  Workload  (C  Accounts).    The  MPM  receives  the  Monthly  Dental  Weighted Values (DWVs) and the Composite Time Values (CTVs) from AFMOA MEPRS.  Ensure the workload  has  corresponding  FTEs  and  expenses.    (T-0)  Dental  Data  will  be  reported  using MTFs Dental DMIS ID, they will not report using the Parent MTF DMIS ID; unless a Dental DMIS ID hasn’t been developed for that MTF.  (T-0) Performance Factors:  Dental Weighted Values (DWVs) and Composite Time Values (CTVs).   Note:  Dental workload is provided to AFMOA MEPRS from the Command Dental Activity, and should be the same data that is provided via the Base Dental Summary Report (BDSR), but the BDSR should not be used for reporting purposes. 8.6.5.  Ancillary  Services  (D  Accounts).    Workload  data  reported  within  the  Ancillary datasets  are  used  to  allocate  ancillary  costs  back  to  the  requesting  work  centers.    Use  the MEPRS Group Report or other applicable ancillary report from CHCS or appropriate system to reconcile data reported in EASIVi ancillary datasets. 8.6.5.1.  Pharmacy  (DA).    Ensure  requesting  work  centers  are  accurately  reported  by reviewing workload products for invalid codes and coordinate with the CHCS Database Administrator to evaluate these codes in CHCS annually.  (T-0) Ensure the workload has corresponding  FTEs  and  expenses.    Use  the  PHR  MEPRS  Group  Report  to  validate pharmacy  workload  reported.    (T-0)  In  coordination  with  Pharmacy  personnel  resolve any exceptions identified on the PHR Workload Exception Report. Performance Factors:  Raw-Number of Scripts, Weighted-Weighted Value of Scripts.   Allocation methodology:  Weighted Value of Scripts. AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 29 Note:  Prescriptions provided to an Inpatient during discharge should be charged to the Ambulatory FCC, not the Inpatient code (i.e an Internal Medicine patient (AAAA), should have their prescriptions charged to BAA* not AAAA, based on the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Team code of the attending provider).  8.6.5.2.  Clinical  Pathology  (DBA),  Cytogenetic  Laboratory  (DBD),  and  Molecular Genetics Laboratory (DBE).  Ensure requesting work centers are accurately reported by reviewing workload products for invalid FCCs and coordinate with the CHCS Database Administrator  to  eliminate  these  codes  in  CHCS.    (T-0)  Ensure  the  workload  has corresponding FTEs and expenses.  (T-0) Use the LAB MEPRS Group Report to validate laboratory workload reported in WAM.  (T-0) In coordination with Laboratory personnel resolve any exceptions identified on the Laboratory Workload Exception Report. Performance Factor:  Raw-Number of Procedures, Weighted-CPT Value of Test Performed.  Allocation methodology:  Weighted Value of Tests Performed.  8.6.5.2.1.  Anatomical  Pathology  (DBB).    Ensure  requesting  work  centers  are accurately reported by reviewing workload products for invalid FCCs and coordinate with the Co-Path Database Administrator to eliminate these codes in the system.   (T-0) Ensure the workload has corresponding FTEs and expenses. (T-0) Performance Factor:  Raw-Number of Procedures, Weighted-CPT Value of Test Performed. Allocation methodology:  Weighted Value of Tests Performed.  8.6.5.3.  Diagnostic Radiology (DC) and Nuclear Medicine (DI).  Ensure requesting work centers  are  accurately  reported  by  reviewing  workload  products  for  invalid  FCCs  and coordinate  with  the  CHCS  Database  Administrator  to  eliminate  these  codes  in  CHCS.  (T-0)  Ensure  the  workload  has  corresponding  FTEs  and  expenses.    (T-0)  Use  the  RAD MEPRS Group Report to validate radiology workload reported in WAM.  In coordination with Radiology personnel resolve any exceptions identified on the Radiology Workload Exception Report. Performance Factor:  Raw-Number of Procedures, Weighted- CPT Value of Test Performed. Allocation methodology:  Weighted Value of Tests Performed. 8.6.5.4.  Cardiac  Catheterization  (DDE)  Ensure  requesting  work  centers  are  accurately reported  by  reviewing  workload  products  for  invalid  FCCs  and  coordinate  with  the CHCS  Database  Administrator  to  eliminate  these  codes  in  CHCS.    (T-0)  Ensure  the workload has corresponding FTEs and expenses. (T-0) Performance Factor:  Raw-Number of Tests, Weighted – CPT Value of Test Performed.  Allocation methodology:  Weighted Value of Tests Performed. 8.6.5.5.  Inhalation  Respiratory  Therapy  (DHA).    Ensure  requesting  work  centers workload is accurately reported.  (T-0) Refer to  preceding paragraph for instructions on how  to  capture  this  workload.    Ensure  the  workload  has  corresponding  FTEs  and expenses.    (T-0)  EASIVi  requires  entry  of  raw  number  of  cases  by  CPT  Code  and automatically calculates weighted values. Performance Factor:  Raw-Number of Cases, Weighted- CPT Value of Test Performed.  Allocation methodology:  Weighted Value of Tests Performed. 30 AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 Note:  If a clinic owns an EEG machine, the workload would be captured and coded as part of the episode of care, it would not need to be broken out by a separate FCC. 8.6.5.6.  Central Sterile Supply (DE).  A local method should be developed to determine accurate workload reporting by FCC hours of service.  These hours should be inclusive of preparation,  cleansing,  sterilization  and  distribution  etc.,  see  DoD  6010.13-M  for guidance.    Ensure  the  workload  has  corresponding  FTEs  and  expenses.    (T-0) Coordination  with  work  center  personnel  provides  appropriate  time  for  reporting purposes. Performance Factor:  Weighted-Hours of Service. Allocation methodology:  Hours of Service. Note:  Several smaller facilities have incorporated the Central Sterile Supply (CSS) service with the Dental CSS operation, in this instance, all of this workload should be tracked as CSS work, unless dental is the only benefiting work center.  Contact AFMOA MEPRS for further guidance. 8.6.5.7.  Anesthesia  (DFA),  Surgical  Suite  (DFB),  Post  Anesthesia  Care  Unit  (DFC), Ambulatory  Procedure  Unit  (APU)  (DGA),  and  Ambulatory  Nursing  Services  (DGE).  Ensure  proper  workload  reporting  is  occurring  in  the  MTF  either  electronically  or manually.  (T-0) Use the methodology as described in DoD 6010.13-M.  Coordinate with surgery department for collection of data.  Ensure the workload has corresponding FTEs and expenses.  (T-0) Performance Factor:  Raw-Cases, Weighted-Minutes of Service.  Allocation methodology:  Minutes of Service.    Note:  There is a relationship between Anesthesiology, Surgical Suite, and Recovery room, but there is no expectation that all three areas are used for all episodes of care. 8.6.5.8.  Hemodialysis  (DGB)  and  Peritoneal  Dialysis  (DGD).    Ensure  proper  workload reporting  is  occurring  either  through  CHCS  or  manually.    (T-0)  Validation  includes  the review  of  the  methodology  (tracking  process)  used  to  calculate  these  figures.    The methodology  includes  time,  number,  and  type  of  personnel  to  ensure  accuracy.    Ensure the workload has corresponding FTEs and expenses.  (T-0) Performance Factor:  Raw-Cases, Weighted - Minutes of Service.  Allocation methodology:  Minutes of Service. 8.6.5.9.  Intensive Care Units (DJ).  Ensure proper workload reporting is occurring either through  CHCS  or  manually.    (T-0)  Validation  should  include  the  review  of  the methodology  used  to  calculate  these  figures.    The  methodology  includes  time,  number, and type of personnel to ensure accuracy.  Ensure the workload has corresponding FTEs and expenses. (T-0) Performance Factor:  Raw-Cases, Weighted - Hours of Service.  Allocation methodology:  Hours of Service. 8.6.6.  Support  Services  (E  Accounts).    Workload  data  reported  within  the  support  datasets are used to allocate support costs back to the requesting work centers. Note:  Refer to Attachment 2 for Support Services FCCs using FTEs as an allocation methodology.  AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 31 8.6.6.1.  Plant  Management  (EDA),  Operation  of  Utilities  (EDB),  Maintenance  of  Real Property (EDC), Minor Construction (Modernization)(EDD), Other Engineering Support (EDE),  Lease of Real Property (EDF).  These accounts support the infrastructure of the facility.  Ensure  the  listed  work  centers  have  corresponding  FTEs  and  expenses  as appropriate.  (T-0) Only Plant Management would capture Time and FTEs, the remaining codes in this section would be for financial transactions only. Allocation methodology:  Square Footage. 8.6.6.1.1.  Square  Footage.    All  square  footage  of  medical  buildings  are  reported  by FCC  at  the  start  of  each  fiscal  year  and  updated  monthly  as  changes  occur.    (T-0) Square footage and square footage cleaned is obtained from the Facility Management Officer using a report from DMLSS. Note:  Unused and facility common square footage would be reported against the plant management FCC – EDAA/**5741 – Real Property Management. 8.6.6.2.  Transportation (EDG).  The reporting of vehicle mileage is dependent on MTF-unique  circumstances.    Report  all  MTF  vehicle  mileage  by  FCC.    (T-0)  When  a  work center has its own fuel card, the requirement for reporting mileage is unnecessary, as the cost is already being allocated against the using work center.  If the fuel cards are shared or  the  MTF  has  General  Service  Administration  (GSA)  leased  vehicles,  then  it  is necessary  to  break  out  each  user  to  make  sure  that  expenses  are  allocated  to  the  using work  centers.    Contact  the  Vehicle  Control  personnel  for  transportation  issues.    Under other circumstances, see AFMOA MEPRS for clarification.  Ensure EDG-Transportation has FTEs and expenses as appropriate.  (T-0) Allocation methodology:  Miles driven. (EE).   Report 8.6.6.3.

(T-0)  The  cost  of  operating  Medical  Materiel  is based  on  the  Element  of  Expense  Investment  Codes  (EEICs)  used  by  the  various  work centers.    A  ratio  of  6XXXX  supplies  used  is  used  to  allocate  the  cost  of  Medical Logistics.  This information is found in EASIVi under Standard Report section, Expense Accepted  by  RC/CC  Report.    Ensure  EEA-  Medical  Logistics  has  corresponding  FTEs and expenses as appropriate.  (T-0) Allocation methodology:  Dollar value of supplies and equipment issued.   8.6.6.4.  Housekeeping  (EF).    Ensure  EFA-Housekeeping  has  corresponding  FTEs  and expenses as appropriate.  (T-0) Allocation methodology:  Square footage cleaned.  8.6.6.4.1.  Square Footage cleaned by FCC cannot exceed square footage by FCC, but is  most  likely  the  same  for  clinical  areas.    For  example,  mechanical  rooms  are  not cleaned  under  the  housekeeping  contract  but  are  included  in  your  square  footage.  Square  footage  cleaned  is  obtained  from  the  Facility  Management  Officer  using  a report from DMLSS. 8.6.6.5.  Biomedical Equipment Repair (EG).  Report Hours of Service by the requesting FCCs  for  Biomedical  Equipment  Repair  Technician  (BMET)  repairs  performed.

Includes all expenses and obligations associated with operating the MTF and meeting the organization’s mission. 9.2.  Expense Data. 9.2.1.  Is a combination of supply, equipment, contract, depreciation, additional support and special program  costs.    These expenses make up the direct  expenses for  MEPRS reporting.  Expenses  are  collected  monthly  from  Defense  Financial  Accounting  System  (DFAS)  using the Commander’s Resources Integration System (CRIS) financial program with the Defense Enterprise  Accounting  and  Management  System  (DEAMS)  as  the  source  file  for  input  into EASIVi.  Personnel expenses are generated from DMHRSi. 9.2.2.  Financial  Data  reported  in  MEPRS  are  accrued  expenses-paid  (AEP)  and  accrued expenses-unpaid  (AEU).    Expenses  include  all  current  months’  transactions  that  affect  any current  or  prior  year  financial  obligation.  For  information  only,  Total  Obligations (AEP+AEU+UOO) is reported for only the current year. 9.2.3.  The  MPM  is  responsible  for  calculating  investment  equipment  depreciation  at  the beginning of each fiscal year.  (T-0) Only investment equipment currently in use at the MTF is  depreciated.    AFMOA  MEPRS  provides  a  Depreciation  Spreadsheet  to  assist  in  the determination  of  the  monthly  depreciation  calculations.    (T-0)  The  following  procedures apply: 9.2.3.1.  The depreciation expense is charged to one or more of the following FCCs based on location of the investment equipment:  Inpatient (EAAA), Outpatient (EABA), Dental (EACA), Special Program (EADA), or Medical Readiness (EAEA). 9.2.3.2.  Request  Medical  Logistics  provide  a  list  of  investment  equipment  currently  in use  from  the  Equipment  Management  Module  of  the  DMLSS  system:    Annual  Capital Equipment Depreciation Report, and the DMLSS Active Historical Maintenance Report.  These  reports  provide  necessary  information  (name,  nomenclature,  fiscal  year  in  which received, purchase price, and cost center) to enter into the depreciation spreadsheet. 9.2.3.3.  Do  not  depreciate  equipment  in  the  year  of  installation,  start  depreciating equipment  the  beginning  of  the  next  fiscal  year.    If  equipment  becomes  no  longer serviceable or is removed from the facility in the course of the year, make the appropriate updates to the depreciation spreadsheet. 9.2.3.4.

Clinical  Pharmacy.    Used  to  report  labor  hours,  workload  and  expenses  for facilities with a separately organized clinic providing Clinical Pharmacy Services.  This will be a clinical function performed in an ambulatory clinic, not to be tracked as DA-Pharmacy workload. A2.49.3.  Primary Behavioral Healthcare Consultation (BHC) Service.  The BHC Service is a term  used  to  describe  any  behavioral  health  service  operating  within  a  primary  care  clinic, using  a  consultative  model  of  behavioral  healthcare  that  is  being  delivered  by  a  clinically trained BHC.   In general, the goal of the BHC Service is to position the Behavioral Health Consultant on the healthcare team to augment and improve the delivery of overall healthcare, including behavioral healthcare.  The BHC is not used to provide comprehensive assessment or treatment of behavioral health conditions, as occurs in the specialty mental health clinic.  The BHC may see the patient or perform limited interventions, but these activities are always designed  to  support  the  PCM’s  impact  on  the  patients’  health.    On-going  communication with the PCM regarding recommendations and the patient’s status is key to the BHC’s role.  In  contrast  to  specialty  mental  health  settings,  consultation  by  the  BHC  does  not  require  a separate informed consent document since behavioral assessment and intervention are a part of the primary healthcare team’s service.  Moreover, documentation is recorded  only in the 56 AFI41-102  5 AUGUST 2016 medical record rather than in a separate mental health chart.  The PCM remains in charge of the patient’s care. A2.50.  BJAB-Personnel  Reliability  Assurance  Program/Presidential  Support  Duty (PRAP/PSD). A2.50.1.  Active  PRAP  should  be  booked  and  seen  under  the  BJAB  FCC.   This  code  is specific to PRAP across the AFMS and allows us to quantify the workload.  AF/SG wants to be able to quantify the PRAP workload across the AFMS in order to build a business case to take to AF/A10 requesting they fund the actual authorizations required to do PRAP.  It is in your best interest to keep all PRAP workload within the BJAB FCC. A2.50.2.  At bases that earn a stand-alone PRAP clinic, the clinic (location and staff) should be  integrated  fully  with  the  Flight  Medicine  Clinic  under  BJAB  FCC.   Enroll  all  fly  PRAP patients  to  BJAA;  workload  coded  as  BJAB.   Enroll  all  non-fly  PRAP  patients  to  BJAB; workload  coded  as  BJAB.   The  PRAP-related  administrative  work,  certifications, qualifications,  etc.,  should  be  documented  under  FCGJ  FCC.   The  administrative  work includes  multi-disciplinary  (Dental,  Mental  Health,  Immunizations,  Public  Health,  etc.) administrative evaluations. A2.51.  BJAC-Personnel  Reliability  Assurance  Program/Presidential  Support  Duty (PRAP/PSD) – Non-Flyers. A2.51.1.
